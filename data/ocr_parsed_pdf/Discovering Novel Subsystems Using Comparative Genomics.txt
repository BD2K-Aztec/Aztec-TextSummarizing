ABSTRACT

Motivation: Key problems for computational genomics include
discovering novel pathways in genome data, and discovering
functional interaction partners for genes to define new members of
partially elucidated pathways.

Results: We propose a novel method for the discovery of
subsystems from annotated genomes. For each gene pair, a score
measuring the likelihood that the two genes belong to a same
subsystem is computed using genome context methods. Genes
are then grouped based on these scores, and the resulting groups
are filtered to keep only high-confidence groups. Since the method
is based on genome context analysis, it relies solely on structural
annotation of the genomes. The method can be used to discover
new pathways, find missing genes from a known pathway, find
new protein complexes or other kinds of functional groups and
assign function to genes. We tested the accuracy of our method
in Escherichia coli K—12. In one configuration of the system, we find
that 31 .6% of the candidate groups generated by our method match
a known pathway or protein complex closely, and that we rediscover
31.2% of all known pathways and protein complexes of at least 4
genes. We believe that a significant proportion of the candidates that
do not match any known group in E.coli K—12 corresponds to novel
subsystems that may represent promising leads for future laboratory
research. We discuss in-depth examples of these findings.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the last decade, the use of in silico approaches to aid in the
discovery of novel pathways has been facilitated by the advent
of high-throughput technology. Protein—protein interactions, genetic
interaction, and metabolic networks have all been used individually
and in combination to ﬁnd gene groups that are likely to constitute
novel pathways.

Kelley and Ideker (2005) propose a method that uses networks of
physical interactions (protein—protein, protein—DNA and metabolic
networks) to help interpret a set of genetic interactions. They
deﬁne a pathway as a densely connected set of proteins in
the network of physical interactions and use this deﬁnition

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

to interpret genetic interactions as being between-pathways or
within-pathway. They also use the resulting pathways to predict
functions of proteins that belong in pathways in which most other
proteins have a common functional annotation, and to predict
new genetic interactions. Ma et a1. (2008) proposed a method to
ﬁnd compensatory pathways using synthetic lethal interactions.
Zhang and Ouellette (2010) combine protein—protein interactions,
genetic interactions, domain—domain interactions and the similarity
of Gene Ontology terms into a single network. Putative pathways
are then generated by searching this network for groups of proteins
that share similar neighborhoods.

A somewhat more modest goal than discovering completely novel
pathways is to ﬁnd the components of a known pathway in a
new organism. Several methods have been proposed to this end.
Cakmak and Ozsoyoglu (2007) present a method for ﬁnding pieces
of a certain pathway in a new organism by abstracting the known
instances of the pathway into ﬁinctionality templates based on
enzyme GO functions. Dale et al. (2010) compare different machine
learning methods for ﬁnding known pathways in new organisms
based on a large set of features. The features are functions of the
pathway that is being searched for as well as of the organism in
which the pathway’s presence is being predicted. Some of these
features are genome context features that reﬂect the relative location
of the genes involved in each pathway in the target genome. Another
method that uses genome context information for tasks related to
pathway discovery is presented by Green and Karp (2007). They use
various genome context methods (gene reaction co-adjacency, gene
neighbors, gene clusters, gene fusions and phylogenetic proﬁles) to
identify missing enzymes in predicted metabolic pathways and to
predict functional relationships.

To our knowledge, all pathway discovery methods in the
literature that aim to ﬁnd novel pathways rely, at least partially,
on interaction networks obtained from (mostly high throughput)
laboratory experiments (Kelley and Ideker, 2005; Ma et al., 2008;
Zhang and Ouellette, 2010). On the other hand, as discussed
above, some methods aimed at ﬁnding known pathways in new
organisms have been proposed that use genome context information,
although, in most cases, they also rely on experimental information.
Furthermore, genome context methods have been used, along
with other information, to infer functional associations between
proteins (see for example, Jansen et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2005;
Marcotte et (11., 1999b; Yamanishi et al., 2005). Nevertheless, no
further efforts toward ﬁnding pathways or functional groups from
this data are made in those cases.

In this work, we present a method for discovery of subsystems
based on genome context methods. We consider a subsystem to
be a set of genes that work together within a biological pathway
or a biological process, or that form a multimeric complex.

Discovering novel subsystems

 

Our system requires a collection of sequenced genomes with
structural annotation (location of genes). Note that, for bacterial
genomes, this kind of annotation is usually done automatically
without the need for manual curation. Our method can be applied to
any new bacterium, regardless of the amount of experimental data
available. We say our system ﬁnds subsystems because we have
found it to yield not just members of known metabolic pathways,
but also genes that function within the same multimeric protein
complex, and within other collections of genes that operate in a
common biological process. The results obtained from this system
can be used to guide ﬁiture experimental research.

As an essential part of the method, we propose a measure of
the likelihood of a certain group of genes being part of the same
subsystem, which we refer to as their ‘group score’. This measure is
computed as the number of organisms in a large, carefully chosen,
database of reference genomes that are enriched for the gene group.
We show that the probability of ﬁnding more than one enriched
organism for a random set of genes is 2.2%, while it is 67% for
known functional gene groups. This measure can be used to ﬁlter
out predicted groups, retaining only those for which at least one
enriched organism is found.

The novelty of the proposed method lies in a few key aspects: (i) as
explained above, while most previous approaches to novel pathway
discovery rely on large experimental interaction datasets, our method
relies exclusively on sequence information that can be extracted
from structurally annotated genomes alone; (ii) the use of a very fast
clique-ﬁnding algorithm for the construction of gene groups that are
likely to be functional groups; and (iii) our proposed ﬁltering step
based on the number of reference organisms enriched for the group.

We describe the method in detail and then discuss a selection
of gene groups that were uncovered with this method, focusing on
how they point to the potential applications of the method in guiding
ﬁiture biological research.

2 METHOD

In this section. we describe the three main components in the proposed system
and brieﬂy describe the ﬁnal stage in which the results of the system are
collected and enriched with all available information to generate html reports.
Figure 1 shows an overview of the method. We call each group of genes
generated by the method a candidate subsystem (or just candidate for short).
since they are hypotheses that need to be conﬁrmed by experimental methods.

2.1 Generation of pairwise scores

The inputs to the subsystem discovery method are a large list of bacterial
reference genomes and the target genome for which gene subsystems are to
be estimated. The ﬁrst step in the method is the generation of a score for
each pair of genes in the target genome that estimates the likelihood that
two genes participate in a same subsystem. that is. that they are part of the
same pathway. biological process or multimeric complex. These scores are
computed using genome context methods. These methods rely exclusively
on sequence similarity information between genes in the target genome
and genes in the reference genomes. Four main genome context methods
have been introduced in the literature: (i) the phylogenetic proﬁle method
(Pellegrini at al.. 1999). which uses the pattern of presence or absence of
the genes in the pair across the reference genomes to generate a score; (ii)
the gene neighbor method (Bowers at al.. 2004) that considers the distance
between the homologs of the genes in the pair across the genomes in which
both genes are found; (iii) the gene cluster method (Overbeek at al.. 1999).
which simply computes the distance between genes in the target genome;
and (iv) the Rosetta Stone or gene fusion method (Enright at al.. 1999;
Marcotte at al.. 1999a). which looks for genes in the reference genomes
that are likely to be a fusion of the two target genes.

In a recent paper (Ferrer at al.. 2010). we presented a thorough
comparative study of these genome context methods and concluded that the
gene neighbor method is signiﬁcantly better than the phylogenetic proﬁle
method in most tested organisms. outperforming it by around 40% at most
operating points of interest in Escherichia coli K—12 gene pairs. The Rosetta
Stone method gives signiﬁcantly worse performance than any of the other
three methods. The gene cluster method. while competitive to the gene
neighbor method at very high speciﬁcity values. is not able to generate

Fig. 1. Overview of the subsystem discovery method. The inputs to the system are a large list of bacterial reference genomes and the target genome for
which candidate subsystems are to be created. Each genome should be structurally annotated. and higher quality annotations should yield better results from
our method. For each gene pair in the target genome. a pairwise score is computed. A network is then created where the nodes are the genes and two nodes

are connected by an edge if the pairwise score for the corresponding gene pair is larger than a certain threshold. A ﬁrst set of candidate gene groups is then
determined by ﬁnding sets of genes that are fully connected to each other. A group score is then computed and used to ﬁlter the resulting candidates. Finally.
the information obtained from all previous steps and other information that can be gathered about the group is collected into html reports.

scores for all possible gene pairs since it is deﬁned as the distance (in
bases) between adjacent genes that are coded in the same strand. Gene pairs
that are not adjacent and coded in the same strand lack gene cluster scores.
Furthermore. we found that the combination of these methods leads to only
small and unreliable gains. Hence. in this article. we use the gene neighbor
method to generate the pairwise scores. Nevertheless. note that any other
score could be used here. including other genome context scores or scores
from experimental studies as long as scores are available for all (or most)
gene pairs in the target genome.

Brieﬂy. the gene neighbor method generates a summary measure of the
observed distances between the best matching sequence for each gene in a
pair of genes (Gi,G]-) from the target genome across the list of reference
genomes. For each genome in the reference list. the best homolog of each
gene G, and Gj in the pair is obtained. The best homolog for gene G is
determined by ﬁnding the gene in the reference genome with the smallest
E-Value (as returned by BLAST). If no E-Value for G is below 10—4. it is
considered that no homolog exists in the reference genome for this gene. For
genomes in which both target genes had a homolog. the distance (measured in
number of intervening genes) between these homologs is recorded. Finally. a
score is computed as a P-Value for the observed distances. See Bowers et al.
(2004) or Ferrer et al. (2010) for details on this method and experimental
results.

The output of this stage is a number for each gene pair (Gi,G]-) that is
assumed to be monotonically related with the likelihood that the two genes
participate in the same subsystem. For this. the negative of the logarithm
of the P-Value described above is used as a score (since smaller P-Values
indicate higher likelihood of two genes participating in the same subsystem).
We call these numbers pairwise scores.

2.2 Finding candidate gene groups

Given the pairwise scores. a network can be created where the nodes are
the genes in the target genome and where edges are added between each
pair of genes for which the pairwise score is larger than a certain threshold.
We deﬁne a candidate gene group to be any set of nodes (genes) that are
fully connected to each other. That is. a candidate is composed of genes
that are likely to be related to all other genes in the candidate. This is a
strong constraint to impose. though a reasonable one if we are interested
only in high-conﬁdence groups. Furthermore. this constraint translates into a
very common task in network analysis: ﬁnding all maximal cliques. Several
algorithms have been designed to solve this task in a computationally efﬁcient
way. We use a python implementation of the BroniKerbosch algorithm.
version 2 (Bron and Kerbosch. 1973).

The output of this stage is a set of gene groups. each group being apotential
subsystem.

2.3 Selection using group scores

In this step. the groups obtained in the previous step are ﬁltered to keep only
high-conﬁdence groups. A group-level score is computed that is used as a
conﬁdence measure for the group. Only groups with a group score larger
than a certain threshold are kept. The group score is computed as the number
of organisms in a reference list of bacterial genomes for which the group is
signiﬁcantly enriched.

Given a certain candidate group. we search for the genes within this group
in the set of reference organisms and compute the enrichment P-Values in
each organism. The P-Value for a candidate in a certain reference genome is
computed using the formula

 

7L '1 [—VL
p: Z (z)((tr)—z) ’
izri, r
where t is the total number of genes in the target genome. r is the total number
of genes in the target genome that have homologs in the reference genome.
n is the number of genes in the candidate and n, is the number of genes
in the candidate that have homologs in the reference genome. This formula

computes the probability of the number of genes in the candidate that have
homologs in the reference genome being larger or equal than the observed
value nr. Each term in the sum is given by the hypergeometric distribution.
where  stands for the ‘x choose y” operation. We use Bonferroni correction
on this P-Value to address the problem of multiple comparisons. That is. the
ﬁnal P-Value is given by p>1<N. where N is the total number of organisms
that were explored for enrichment.

Finally. the group score is the number of organisms enriched for the group.
The P-Value threshold used to determine enrichment is a parameter of the
method. The performance of these scores as a measure of the likelihood that
the group is. in fact. a subsystem is presented in Section 3.2.

2.4 Final selection and generation of reports

The candidates generated by the steps above might include groups that are
not of interest and. hence. can be discarded from the output shown to the user.
For example. they might include groups that are known subsystems for the
organism. A scientist who is searching through the list for novel subsystems
might wish to ignore these already-known groups. In the case of E.coli K—12.
a large proportion of the candidates have an already-known function. This
proportion is. of course. much smaller in organisms for which less curation
is available. Another possible criterion for ﬁltering candidates is to keep only
groups that contain a certain set of genes of interest. For example. if the goal
was to ﬁnd metabolic pathways. one might decide to keep only groups that
contain some percent of known enzymes. For the results presented in this
paper. no such selection procedure is applied.

The last step in the process takes the ﬁltered set of candidates. gathers
all information about the genes in the groups that is present in our database
(products and their functions. and reactions in which they are involved).
infers new information using computational methods (including enrichment
and depletion P-Values for the group in the reference organisms. correlation
between the group and known pathways based on their pattern of appearance
in the reference organisms. and so on) and formats all of this information into
a set of web pages. The goal is for these pages to record as much information
as possible to allow the scientist looking through the lists to make informed
decisions about which candidates are worth looking at in more detail. A
manual describing the information available in the web pages is available
in the website indicated in the Abstract. This website also contains a set of
precomputed lists of candidates for E.coli K—12.

3 RESULTS

This section presents a set of experimental results obtained by
applying our method to identify novel subsystems in E.coli K—IZ.
We used EcoCyc version 14.5 (Keseler et al., 2009) which contains
944 protein complexes and 235 metabolic pathways curated from
the E. coli K-12 literature, of which we only consider groups of size
>3 for a total of 103 and 112 complexes and pathways, respectively.
The list of reference organisms is the set of 623 bacterial genomes
available in BioCyc 14.5 (Caspi et al., 2008; Karp et al., 2005). We
show three sets of results. The ﬁrst two sets evaluate the performance
of the pairwise and group scores, and the last result set evaluates the
performance of the system as a whole.

3.1 Performance of pairwise scores

We present the results for the gene neighbor method used to generate
the pairwise scores for the current implementation of the system.
The test set for these experiments is created by listing all pairs of
genes in EcoCyc and labeling each pair as a positive sample if the
products of the two genes are listed in the same pathway or protein
complex in this database, and as a negative sample otherwise. A
thorough study of genome context score methods, including the gene

Discovering novel subsystems

 

neighbor method, can be found in Ferrer et al. (2010). In that work,
we found that pruning the reference list of organisms to discard
highly related ones resulted in an improvement in performance for
most genome context methods. Hence, the gene neighbor scores
used in this article are generated using a pruned list of reference
organisms of size 468. This list is obtained by hierarchical clustering
of organism proﬁles (vectors where each component corresponds
to a gene in E.coli K-12 and the entries are 1 if the gene has a
homolog in the organism and 0 otherwise) from the original list of
623 bacterial genomes (see Ferrer et al., 2010, for details). Note that
this clustering method is probably not optimal, since organisms that
are distant from E.coli K—IZ might look closer to each other than
they really are. In future work, we plan to explore more general
clustering methods that avoid this bias. Both reference genome lists
are given in the website indicated in the Abstract.

Table 1 shows the recall and precision of the gene neighbor
methods at three different operating points. An operating point is
determined by the score threshold used to declare two genes as
belonging to the same subsystem. Each threshold, in turn, results in
a network where edges are given between two genes if the pairwise
score for the gene pair (given by the negative of the logarithm of
the gene neighbor P-value) is larger than the threshold. We specify
the operating point by the percent of edges in the resulting network
with respect to the total number of edges if the network was fully
connected. For example, in a network with four nodes, the fully
connected network would have six (four choose two) edges. If the
network instead has three edges, the percent of edges would be 50%.

Given a certain threshold, the number of true positives (11)) and
true negatives (In) can be obtained by counting the number of gene
pairs with score higher than the threshold (existing edges) that
participate in a common subsystem in our test set, and the number
of gene pairs with score lower than the threshold (missing edges)
that do not take part in any common subsystem, respectively. We
measure the performance of the scores using recall and precision,
which are deﬁned as tp/dp>i< 100 and tp/pp>i< 100, respectively, where
dp is the total number of positive samples in the database and pp is
the total number of predicted positive pairs.

We present results for three networks: one with 0.07% edges
(only one gene pair out of 1400 is connected by an edge), one with
0.15% edges (one pair out of 666 is connected by an edge) and
one with 2% edges (one pair out of 50 is connected by an edge).
The corresponding threshold on the gene neighbor P-value is also
shown. The ﬁrst setting coincides with the percent of edges in the
actual E.coli K—IZ network obtained by putting edges between any
two genes that are found in the same pathway or protein complex in
EcoCyc. The ROC for the gene neighbor method on different subsets
of the Escherichia coli K-12 genes can be found in Ferrer et al.
(2010).1

We can see that, for the ﬁrst setting corresponding to a sparser
network, 26.94% of the predicted pairs are correct with respect
to both pathways and protein complexes. This percent is almost
halved for the second setting and 16 times smaller for the third
setting. At these levels of precision, the recall of these scores is
around 26, 35 and 47%, respectively. We can see that the increase
in recall comes at the expense of a drastic increase in the percent of

we have higher conﬁdence on the labels. Table 1 shows the results on all
genes. This is why results in the article and the table are not identical.

positives. Results are computed over all pairs of genes from Ecoli K—12. The thresholds

incorrect predictions. Given that the number of negative samples in
the database is around 8 million, these percents correspond to around
4000, 12 000 and 150 000 mislabeled negative samples. Meanwhile,
the numbers of correctly labeled positive samples are 1600, 2146 and
2874, since the total number of positive samples in the database is
6115. The gain in recall for the higher setting does not seem to justify
the sharp increase in the number of mislabeled negative samples
which would result in a large proportion of false subsystems. For
this reason, in Section 3.3 we show performance for only the ﬁrst
two, sparser, settings.

Finally, note that the gene neighbor method is able to ﬁnd protein
complexes much better than pathways. That is, genes involved in
protein complexes are more likely to be highly conserved across the
reference organisms than genes involved in pathways.

3.2 Performance of group scores

We evaluate the performance of the group enrichment score
described in Section 2.3 using the known pathways and protein
complexes in EcoCyc version 14.5. The test database is generated
using the following procedure. For each known group (pathway
or protein complex) in the EcoCyc database, positive samples are
created as random subsets of the genes in the group. For each
subset size, up to 10 samples are created (or less, if fewer than
10 combinations of genes of the corresponding size are possible).
Negative samples are created as random sets of different sizes of
all the genes in EcoCyc. The distribution of negative group sizes
follows the distribution of positive groups sizes: for each created
positive sample, 10 negative samples of the same size are randomly
created. The resulting database contains 130730 negative samples
and 13 073 positive samples. For more details on the generation of
this database, see the Supplementary Material.

For each gene group in this database, we compute the number of
organisms in the reference list that are enriched for the gene group.
We explored the use of different reference lists and different P-value
thresholds for the determination of which organisms are enriched. As
shown in the Supplementary Material, the best settings corresponds
to using a pruned set of 468 reference organisms (obtained as
described in the previous section) with a P-value threshold of 0.10.
Using these parameters, we ﬁnd that no negative sample has a
number of enriched organisms >25. The percent of positive samples
for which there are at least that many enriched organism is 34%. That

is, if we set the third step of our method to ﬁlter out all candidates
with a number of enriched organisms <25, we can expect to discard
most (if not all) of the negative samples and keep around 34% of
the positive ones. In the other extreme, we can choose to keep all
candidates that have at least one enriched organism in the reference
list of size 468. This would result in 2.2% of the negative samples
and 67% of the positive samples being accepted as ﬁnal candidates.

3.3 Performance of subsystem candidates

We measure the performance of the candidates resulting from the
subsystem prediction method using two metrics: the percent of
correct candidates deﬁned as the percent of candidates that match
at least one known pathway or protein complex in EcoCyc, and
the percent of groups found deﬁned as the percent of pathways and
protein complexes in EcoCyc that match at least one candidate.

A pathway or protein complex and a candidate are considered to
match if their adjusted rand index (ARI) is larger than 0.5. This
is the same deﬁnition used by Zhang and Ouellette (2010), which
facilitates comparison. ARI scores are commonly used to determine
agreement between partitions in a graph. They lie between 0 and 1
for any two groups that overlap in at least one gene, being 1 when
the two gene groups are identical. See Zhang and Ouellette (2010)
for the formula used to compute the ARI score.

We focus on pathways, protein complexes and candidates of size
4 or larger. The method reduces to the genome context method alone
for groups of size 2. Furthermore, for these smaller groups of size
2 and 3 the enrichment P-values are not useful, since they rarely
reach values small enough to consider an organism enriched.

Table 2 shows the two performance measures and the number
of candidates generated for different settings of the gene neighbor
score threshold and the minimum number of enriched organisms
considering performance with respect to both pathways and protein
complexes, to pathways only and to complexes only. We can see
that the parameters of the system have signiﬁcant effects on the
performance. Nevertheless, there is no clear winner. The selection
of parameters should be made based on the way the candidates
will be used. For example, if the goal of running the system is
to ﬁnd a promising group of genes that will be further evaluated
in the laboratory, we might wish to set the parameters to obtain
only high-conﬁdence candidates (for example, % edges=0.07%
and # em: 30). This results in around half of the candidates being
correct, but it ﬁnds very few of the known pathways and protein
complexes. On the other hand, if the purpose for running the system
is to complement knowledge obtained from a separate source, such
as large-scale gene expression or proteomics results, then a large
number of candidates might be desirable, since additional ﬁltering
criteria can be applied based on the original source of information.
Finally, note that the threshold on the number of enriched organisms
does not necessarily need to be selected a priori by the user of the
system. By setting the threshold to 0, all candidates for a certain %
edges can be generated and the number of enriched organisms can
then be used as a conﬁdence measure to prioritize experiments or as
a score to be combined with measures coming from other sources.

An interesting observation from this table is that protein
complexes are more easily found by our proposed method than
pathways. This is probably mostly due to the fact that the gene
neighbor method is able to detect gene pairs involved in the same
protein complex better than those involved in the same pathway

Columns correspond to the percent of edges in the network [edges (%)], the minimum
number of enriched organisms (# enr.), the number of candidates output by the system
(# cand.), the percentage of correct candidates [correct (%)] and the percentage of gene
groups (pathways or protein complexes) in EcoCyc that are found by the system [found
(%)]. For correct (%), we show three numbers: considering matches to both pathways
and protein complexes, to pathways only and to complexes only (these last two numbers
do not add up to the ﬁrst because some candidate groups match both complexes and
pathways). For found (%), we also show three numbers: the percentage of both pathways
and complexes from EcoCyc that are found, the percentage of pathways only and the
percentage of complexes only.

(Table 1). Relaxing the constraint that groups have to be fully
connected by the gene neighbor scores (enforced by the clique
ﬁnding algorithm) could improve our performance on pathways and
is part of our planned work for the near future.

The results in Table 2 may seem to contradict those presented
in the previous section. As we discussed, the enrichment scores are
highly reliable: no random gene group has >25 enriched organisms.
Nevertheless, Table 2 shows that when we set the minimum number
of enriched organisms to 30, we still get a percent of incorrect
candidates >50%. This contradiction is partially explained by the
fact that the negative samples in Section 3.2 were random groups
of genes, while the ones in Table 2 are chosen for having high
gene neighbor scores for all pairs in the group. Hence, the negative
samples in this table are a small subset of all possible negative
samples and they are, by the very deﬁnition of the gene neighbor
method, more likely to result in higher enrichment scores. On the
other hand, based on the study of a few high-conﬁdence examples,
we believe that this apparent contradiction is also partially explained
by the fact that many of the candidates with a large number of
enriched organisms are, indeed, subsystems—but not the kind that
EcoCyc formally represents, and therefore not detectable as true
positives. Other candidates may fail to match any protein complexes
or pathways in EcoCyc for the very simple reason that they represent
correctly identiﬁed novel gene groups for which no experimental
work has been done yet. Both possibilities are discussed further in
the following section.

Comparing the results of subsystem prediction methods presented
in the literature is a complicated matter due to the lack of a standard
test set and stande performance measures. The closest comparison
we have found is with Zhang and Ouellette (2010). They obtain
a 5.6% of correct prediction on the BioCyc database out of 195
predicted pathways. This number should be compared with the
pwy column under % correct in Table 2 for a similar number of
candidates. For two different setting of the algorithm, we get 12.56
and 16.99% correct, an improvement larger than two times over

their algorithm (which was, in turn, shown to be better than other
methods in the literature).

4 DISCUSSION

In applying our method to the biology of E.coli K—IZ as it is
represented in EcoCyc, we have the opportunity to ‘discover’ known
groups, some that are not currently formally represented, and some
that are likely to be entirely novel, in addition to rediscovering
groups already represented in EcoCyc.

Groups mentioned in the following discussion were obtained
with the network with % edges=0.07%. The candidate numbers
mentioned in this section correspond to those used in the website
indicated in the Abstract for the corresponding % edges. They can all
be found in the link corresponding to # em: 0, which is a superset
of all the other sets of candidates with larger # enr.

4.1 Rediscovered known subsystems

As described above, we identify from 11% to 55% of the protein
complexes and pathways that are formally described within the
EcoCyc database depending on the settings of the system. Examples
of this kind of ‘perfect match’ include the histidine biosynthesis
pathway, tryptophan biosynthesis and the ATP synthase complex.
The candidate that mapped to histidine biosynthesis (number 0073
in the web page corresponding to % edges: 0.07% and # enr=0)

included all eight genes coding for the enzymes in the histidine
biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 2A). This is representative of a typical
‘perfect ﬁt’ match between a candidate and the EcoCyc data.

The best percent found value of 55% (Table 2) may seem
low at ﬁrst, but in the context of what is actually within our
test set it actually makes a great deal of sense. Pathways and
protein complexes are both conceptual units, identiﬁed by human
researchers and entered into databases such as EcoCyc by human
curators. Although the reasoning behind the selection of this kind
of subsystem is typically quite sound—for example, the histidine
biosynthesis pathway in EcoCyc starts with a reaction that is subject
to feedback regulation by histidine and ends with a reaction that
produces histidine—it is not a given that this kind of human-deﬁned
conceptual unit is also evolutionarily conserved (Green and Karp,
2006). In other words, the group that is predicted based on genome
context information may not precisely match the subsystem that
exists within our databases, leading to a ‘failure to ﬁnd’ those
human-deﬁned groups.

One fascinating example of this kind of mismatch between our
concept of a pathway and the results of this method is a candidate
we call the ‘core hydrogenase pair’ (Fig. 2B, candidate number 0056
in the web page corresponding to % edges: 0.07% and # enr=0).
This candidate counterintuitively collects half the genes from each of
two putative hydrogenase complexes in E. coli K-1 2 (Andrews et al.,
1997; Bagramyan et al., 2001; Bohm et al., 1990; Self et al., 2004).
A close, protein domain-centered analysis of the results, however,

reveals that this group appears to comprise a pair of redundant
‘hydrogenase cores’, rigorously conserved across the group of
enriched organisms. The experimental support for the speciﬁc
composition of the hyc (hydrogenase 3) and hyf (hydrogenase 4)
complexes as represented in EcoCyc 14.5 is sparse. This candidate
group may point to a conserved hydrogenase core and an array of
more organism-speciﬁc adapters, indicating a possible direction for
ﬁiture evaluation in the laboratory.

4.2 Known, but not represented, subsystems

Some of the candidates represent the successful identiﬁcation of
known subsystems that happen not to be represented formally within
our test dataset. These cases are incorrectly counted as errors in our
statistics in Table 2. The ‘cell division’ candidate (Fig. 2D, candidate
number 0009 in the web page corresponding to % edges = 0.07% and
# enr = 0) clearly contains the components of the septal ring, a critical
structure that forms during cell division, but which is not represented
formally within EcoCyc (Weiss, 2004). It also maps quite well onto
the division cell wall (dcw) cluster of genes that has been identiﬁed
as a set of conserved cell division genes (Mingorance et al., 2004;
Real and Henriques, 2006; Vicente et al., 1998).

This candidate also represents another potential opportunity in
this type of result—what could be called the ‘N+1’ result. In the
case of the candidate shown in Figure 2D, the majority of the
genes are clearly directly involved in the structural aspects of
cell division, with the majority being split between peptidoglycan
biosynthesis (blue) and septal ring formation (green). The gene
rsmH, which is not in either of these groups, is active against
membrane-located substrates and is at least indirectly required for
proper cell division, with disruption leading to an alteration in
doubling times (Carrion et al., 1999; Kimura and Suzuki, 2010).
However, the group also includes the gene mraZ, which has been
the subject of crystallization and attempted enzyme analysis, but
for which a speciﬁc cellular role is unknown (Adams et al., 2005).
The strong association between mraZ and this subsystem suggests
narrowing future analysis of this gene to ﬁrst examine a potential
role in cell division, with a speciﬁc emphasis on peptidoglycan
and the septal ring. This is generally representative of how such
results have the potential to reduce the extensive time and effort
spent trying to assign functions to the increasingly recalcitrant set
of uncharacterized genes.

A related case is represented by the molybdopterin biosynthesis
candidate, comprising moaA, moaB, moaC and man (candidate
number 0306 in the web page corresponding to % edges=0.07%
and # em: 0). These genes have been experimentally identiﬁed as
forming a pathway for molybdopterin biosynthesis, but the steps in
that pathway have not been fully elucidated (Gutzke et al., 2001;
Leimkuhler et al., 2001). As a consequence, there is insufﬁcient
information to include a formal pathway in EcoCyc. Nonetheless,
this is a clear subsystem. The prediction of this group actually
offers some assistance to experimental elucidation of the pathway,
as it can help constrain the set of genes that must be examined as
biochemists attempt to pin down the enzymatic steps involved in
making molybdopterin.

4.3 Likely novel subsystems

Of the candidates that do not match known EcoCyc pathways and
complexes, some are likely to be novel subsystems. It would be

curious if this were not the case, as ~30% of E. coli K-12 genes still
lack experimental functional characterization.

For example, one predicted group combines apparently disparate
genes that are not found in the same operon within E.c0li
K-IZ (candidate number 0127 in the web page corresponding to
% edges = 0.07% and # em: 0). These include two genes known to
be required for anaerobic camitine reduction (ﬁxA and ﬁxB), two that
are predicted to code for acyl-CoA dehydrogenase subunits (ydiQ
and ydiR) and two predicted ﬂavoproteins (ygcR and ygcQ). Taken
together, this may represent a previously uncharacterized electron
transfer pathway. As these genes occur in three different places in
the E.coli K-IZ genome, the group is not likely to be obvious by a
simple examination of the genome.

The ‘PFL’ candidate (Fig. 2C, candidate number 0061 in the web
page corresponding to % edges=0.07% and # enr=0) is another
example of scattered genes that are clearly coordinated when viewed
through the lens of our approach. They are functionally related in
terms of individual sequence, most likely representing a history
of ancestral gene duplications. Despite these duplications, this
candidate displays a surprising tenacity, appearing as a conserved
group across a large number of organisms even though its members
are often very far from each other on a given genome. Many of
the constituent genes are not well characterized in E. coli K-12, but
researchers may beneﬁt from approaching them as a system, in light
of their identiﬁcation as a conserved group.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We propose a method for the discovery of novel subsystems
in a target genome. The method relies exclusively on sequence
information and, hence, only requires structurally annotated
genomes as input, not needing any other experimental or manually
curated information. The system can be tuned to generate few high-
conﬁdence gene groups or a larger number of lower conﬁdence
groups. The output of the system is stored in a set of web pages
that integrate a large amount of information about the gene groups.
We assessed the performance of the method on E.c0li K-IZ,
using the manually curated information about pathways and protein
complexes available in EcoCyc version 14.5. We ﬁnd that, in one
particular setting of the parameters, the system ﬁnds 31.2% of all
known pathways and protein complexes in EcoCyc that include at
least four genes, and that 31.6% of all the candidate groups of size
4 or larger generated by the system match a known pathway or
protein complex closely. Careful analysis of the highest conﬁdence
groups obtained for E.coli K-IZ leads us to conclude that a large
percent of the remaining groups is likely to consist of a mix of known
groups that were not formally represented in our test data and novel
subsystems that have not yet been evaluated in the laboratory.
These novel and ‘near match’ predictions can serve as a valuable
resource in guiding ﬁiture laboratory research, such as the effort
to characterize the remaining 30% of genes of unknown function
in E.c0li K—IZ. Predictions can help constrain the size of the
experimental problem, as in the case of molydopterin synthesis,
identify conserved subsystems that may be larger or smaller than
we expected, as was seen with the mixed hyc/hyf group, or
even identify scattered subsystems, such as the possible electron
transport pathway, that are nearly impossible to identify through
manual examination of a genome. Although changing the parameters
of the method can lead to different results, the ability to focus

initial experiments on a handful of genes instead of all of them
represents a signiﬁcant opportunity for savings in time and effort
at the bench. These predictions, most likely in combination with
high-throughput methods such as gene expression, proteomics or
phenotype microarrays, can also provide guidance in addressing the
otherwise opaque problem of assigning ﬁinction to uncharacterized
genes.

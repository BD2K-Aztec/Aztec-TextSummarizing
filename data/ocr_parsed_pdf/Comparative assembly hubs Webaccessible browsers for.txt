ABSTRACT

Motivation: Researchers now have access to large volumes of
genome sequences for comparative analysis, some generated by
the plethora of public sequencing projects and, increasingly, from
individual efforts. It is not possible, or necessarily desirable, that the
public genome browsers attempt to curate all these data. Instead, a
wealth of powerful tools is emerging to empower users to create their
own visualizations and browsers.

Results: We introduce a pipeline to easily generate collections of
Web-accessible UCSC Genome Browsers interrelated by an align-
ment. It is intended to democratize our comparative genomic browser
resources, serving the broad and growing community of evolutionary
genomicists and facilitating easy public sharing via the Internet. Using
the alignment, all annotations and the alignment itself can be efficiently
viewed with reference to any genome in the collection, symmetrically.
A new, intelligently scaled alignment display makes it simple to view all
changes between the genomes at all levels of resolution, from substi-
tutions to complex structural rearrangements, including duplications.
To demonstrate this work, we create a comparative assembly hub
containing 57 Escherichia coli and 9 Shigella genomes and show
examples that highlight their unique biology.

Availability and implementation: The source code is available as
open source at: https://github.com/glennhickey/progressiveCactus
The Eco/i and Shigella genome hub is now a public hub listed on
the UCSC browser public hubs Web page.

1 INTRODUCTION

Visualization is key to understanding functional and comparative
genomic information. Genome browsers are therefore critical to
the study of biology, providing accessible resources for displaying
annotations and alignments. The UCSC Genome Browser
(Karolchik et a]. 2014) is one of the most popular, but creating
a reference genome browser for a new genome within it previously

required signiﬁcant resources, as it was necessary to create a
mirror site to host the new reference browser separately, or to
work with the staff of the genome browser to create a new refer-
ence browser within their main site. Assembly hubs (Karolchik
et a]. 2014), which build on the successful track hub model (Raney
et a]. 2013), make it easy to generate an individual UCSC browser
simply by hosting the data in the form of ﬂat files on any publicly
addressable URL. This avoids users having to install and conﬁg-
ure the substantial browser code base on their machines and, by
using user hosting, makes updating straightforward. However,
with access to low-cost sequencing technology and the wealth of
genomes already available, users increasingly want to be able to
create not only a single custom browser, but also sets of genome
browsers. This work is intended to meet that growing need; it
extends assembly hubs to allow users to quickly create ‘compara—
tive assembly hubs’, a framework of multiple genome browsers
and annotations interrelated by an alignment. As part of this de-
velopment, we introduce a series of novel features intended to
improve Visualization, exploration and community sharing of
novel comparative genomics data.

Displaying multiple genome alignments is extremely challen-
ging owing to both the high dimensionality and volume of the
underlying data [see Nielsen et a]. (2010) for a review]. There are
currently three main ways to Visualize multiple genome align-
ments: dot plots [e.g. DAGChainer (Haas et a]. 2004), VISTA-
Dot (Mayor et a]. 2000), etc.], circle plots [e.g. Circos
(Krzywinski et a]. 2009), GenomeRing (Herbig et a]. 2012),
etc.] and linear, row-oriented representations [e.g. VISTA
(Mayor et al. 2000), Jalview (Waterhouse et a]. 2009), IGV
(Thorvaldsdottir et a]. 2013), etc.]. Each of these Visualization
methods has beneﬁts and weaknesses. Dots plots, having two
dimensions, provide equivalently powerful representations of
two genomes in one graphic; however, they are pairwise and
therefore unsuitable for the display of multiple genome align-
ments. Circular genome plots are typically less Visually cluttered
than linear representations for Viewing genomic rearrangements,
but are less useful for the display of global multiple sequence
alignments, as might be shown at the gene or base level.
Linear representations have the advantage that they fit neatly
with the genome browser displays and tracks, and are ﬂexible,
in that they work reasonably at multiple levels of resolution.

Here we introduce a new linear displayithe snake tracki
that, to our knowledge, is the first linear representation to

allow the Viewing of all variations, including structural
rearrangements, duplications, substitutions, insertions and dele-
tions in a single, conceptually simple, interactive Visualization.
In addition, by using a novel algorithm to generate procedural
levels of detail (LOD), it is Viewable at every resolution, from
complete chromosomes to individual residues. Being based on a
symmetric reference independent alignment format (Hickey et al.
2013), for the ﬁrst time for an alignment View in the UCSC
browser, snake tracks are Viewable between any set of genomes
in the hub and from any chosen genome, as all genomes in a hub
have a generated reference browser. This is important because
restricting browsing to a single reference can limit Visualization
of regions in other genomes that do not map to the reference, or
which are rearranged with respect to a reference. Finally, to
overcome the limitation of Viewing the alignment only from
the perspective of any single reference genome, each comparative
assembly hub provides an automatically generated pangenome
reference browser, using our recently developed algorithm
(Nguyen et al. 2014). Similar to the pioneering Visualization con-
cepts described in Herbig et al. (2012), this pangenome includes a
single consensus copy of every set of homologous subsequences
in an ordering that as closely as possible reﬂects the (weighted)
consensus of the input genomes. We will show how this can be
used to create unique Views of the dataihere we demonstrate
the creation of an Escherichia coli core genome.

Besides a new Visualization, the comparative assembly hubs
are novel from a genome browser perspective. The underlying
alignment is used, by a process of lift-over (Zhu et a1. 2007), to
automatically project annotations to any genome in the hub,
even if the annotations were originally mapped to just one
genome. Previously, lift-over was used on a case-by-case basis
within the genome browser to project tracks between assemblies,
for example, when moving to an updated assembly. Here we
make it a default, integral feature, making it easy to View puta-
tive genes and functional annotations on novel genomes by a
process of translation through the underlying alignment, rather
than through a set of (frequently inconsistent) ad hoc pairwise
alignments. The comparative assembly hubs framework is also,
to our knowledge, the ﬁrst Web-based genome browser that
allows easy public sharing of comparative data without requiring
other users to download dataionly a Web browser is required.
Finally, separately to the novel features introduced, we have
worked to integrate these user-generated browsers with many
of the existing tools of the UCSC browser.

2 RESULTS

We first describe the software pipeline for building comparative
assembly hubs, before describing them by example using an
alignment of E.c0li and Shigella genomes.

2.1 Comparative assembly hubs pipeline

Our software pipeline comprises three main modular compo-
nents, for which we provide an overall distribution that can be
downloaded and installed with a few commands (see Section 3),
and which should work on unix distributions such as Linux,
BSD and OS X. The first component is the Cactus alignment
program (Paten et al. 2011), which takes as input a set of genome

sequences and outputs a genome multiple sequence alignment in
hierarchical alignment (HAL) format (Hickey et al. 2013). The
second component is HAL tools, to which we have added a series
of command-line tools and C/C -l-+ Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) for manipulating HAL ﬁles and building
comparative assembly hubs. The ﬁnal component is the snake
track display, which is now part of the UCSC Genome Browser
code base (Karolchik et al. 2014), and which provides Visualiza-
tion of alignments directly from HAL files.

The pipeline is run in three steps. First, either Cactus is run to
generate the HAL alignment file directly, or an MAF ﬁle, gen-
erated separately by an aligner such as Multiz (Miller et al. 2007),
is converted into a HAL file using the maf2Hal tool (in the HAL
tools package). Second, the hal2AssemblyHub script (in the
HAL tools package) builds the comparative assembly hub
using the HAL ﬁle and any set of annotation ﬁles provided,
either in BED or WIG format (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/
FAQformat.html). This script takes care of converting the base
annotation ﬁles into the display scaleable bigBed and bigWig
formats and translates these annotations (optionally) Via a
process of alignment lift-over (Zhu et al. 2007) to all the other
genomes. At the end of this process, a directory is created that
contains the necessary files, using compressed formats for min-
imal space usage. In the ﬁnal step, the location of the ‘hub.txt’
file, addressable as a public URL, is pasted into the UCSC
browser hub page to View the browsers.

The pipeline builds one browser for each input genome and, in
addition, any ancestral or pangenomes that were imputed
(e.g. by Cactus, if used) during the alignment process (Nguyen
et al. 2014).

2.2 Escherichia coli comparative assembly hub

To demonstrate this work, we use a set of 57 E.c0li and 9 Shigella
spp. complete genomes. Escherichia coli contains substantial
intraspecies genomic diversity, which allows for its high versatil-
ity and variation, encompassing various pathotypes, antibiotic
resistances and lifestyles [see review in Leimbach et al. (2013)].
Comparative genomic analyses of multiple strains of E.c0li have
proven useful in understanding the molecular basis of their
phenotypic differences and assisting in practical applications
such as diagnostic and antibiotic developments for infectious
disease (Didelot et al. 2012). Owing to intense study, E.c0li is
one of the most sequenced bacterial species, with the second
highest number of complete sequenced genomes (after
Salmonella enterica, source: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/bao—
teria.html) available at the time of writing. Automated tools
for comparison and Visualization are therefore critical for re-
search efforts to keep pace with available data.

To illustrate a browser, Figure 1 displays a region of one of
the E.c0li reference genomes, K12 MG1655. The topmost
tracks are K12 MG1655 annotations, including conservation,
GC percentage, genes, antibiotic resistance database, genomic
islands and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs; rRNA and tRNA).
Below these are snake tracks, showing the alignment of the
genome to a subset of the other genomes, and a lifted-over
ncRNA annotation track (track K12 W3110 RNA) of E.c0li
K12 W3110.

2.2.] The snake track Each snake track shows the relationship
between the chosen browser genome, termed the reference
(genome), and another genome, termed the query (genome).
The snake display is capable of showing all possible types of
structural rearrangement. When stacked together, snake tracks
allow a ﬂexible View of multiple genomes.

In full display mode (snake tracks in Fig. 1), a snake track can
be decomposed into two primitive drawing elements: segments,
which are the colored rectangles, and adjacencies, which are the
lines connecting the segments. Segments represent subsequences
of the query genome aligned to the given portion of the reference
genome. Adjacencies represent the covalent bonds between the
aligned subsequences of the query genome. Segments can be
configured to be colored by chromosome, strand (as shown) or
be left a single color. Layout of the segments is described in
Section 3. At the highest LOD above that showing individual
bases (i.e. the ﬁrst level of summary detail above the original
alignment), red tick marks within segments represent substitu-
tions with respect to the reference (Fig. 1b and 0). Further zoom-
ing in to the base level, these substitutions are labeled with the
non-reference base (Fig. 1d). An insertion in the reference rela-
tive to the query creates a gap between abutting segment sides
that is connected by an adjacency. An insertion in the query
relative to the reference is represented either by an orange tick
mark that splits a segment at the location the extra bases would
be inserted or by coloring an adjacency orange, indicating that
there are unaligned bases between the two connected segment
ends.

More complex structural rearrangements create adjacencies
that connect the sides of non-abutting segments in a natural
fashion, e.g. Figure 1 shows the known large inversion in K12
MG1655’s closely related strain K12 W3110 (Hill and Harnish
1981). The inversion is a result of a homologous recombination,
with operon rrnD, consisting of rrsD, ileU, alaU, rrlD, WfD, thrV
and WfF, and operon rrnE, consisting of rrsE, gltV, rrlE and
rrfE, being homologous segments with opposite directions
(Fig. 1b and 0). Also shown in Figure 1 are two smaller inver-
sions in KOllFL (Turner et al. 2012) and 026 H111 1368
(Ogura et al. 2009) and a relatively much smaller inversion in HS.

Duplications within the query genome create extra segments
that overlap along the reference genome axis, e. g. Figure 2 shows
a tandem repeat region of E.coli KOllFL 162099 displayed
along the genome of E.coli K01 1FL 52593 that was engineered
by the chromosomal insertion of the Zymomonas mobilis pdc,
ath and cat genes into E.coli W for ethanol production pur-
poses (Ohta et al. 1991); 162099 is a derivative of 52593 and
contains 20 tandem copies of the inserted pdc—ath—cat genes
(Turner et al. 2012).

To show regions where the query segments align to multiple
locations within the reference, for each snake track we draw
color-coded sets of lines along the reference genome axis that
indicate self-homologies (intervals of the reference genome that
align to other intervals of the reference genome). To maintain the
semantics of the snake, in which each query segment is drawn
only once, we align any query segment that aligns to multiple
segments in the reference to just the leftmost copy in the refer-
ence (Fig. 2), because otherwise the display ceases to be an alter-
nating sequence of blocks and adjacencies representing the
query. However, the multiple alignment information is not lost,

as the overlap with the color-coded segments on the reference
axis informs the Viewer to interpret such a query segment as
being multi-aligned to the reference.

The pack display option can be used to display a snake track in
more limited vertical space. It eliminates the adj acencies from the
display, and forces the segments onto as few rows as possible
given the constraint of still showing duplications in the query
sequence (e.g. track W 162101 of Fig. 2). The dense display fur-
ther eliminates these duplications so that a snake track is com-
pactly represented along just one row, essentially showing the
coverage of the query genome on the reference (e.g. the last
snake track of Fig. 2). Finally, the squish display is similar to
dense but with a thinner thickness of the row to maximally
reduce the vertical space (e.g track IAIl of Fig. 2).

Clicking on segments moves the display to the corresponding
region in the query genome, making it simple to navigate be-
tween references, all of which have equivalent displays. This sym-
metry frees the user from investigating the alignment from just
one perspective. Various mouse-overs are implemented to show
the sizes of display elements, and the snakes and annotations can
be reordered by dragging.

2.2.2 Procedural levels of alignment detail The different LODs
displayed in Figure 1a41 show the alignment at mega-base, kilo-
base and base levels. To achieve this in a Web browser, serving
data across the Internet (generally still a relatively slow and high
latency connection compared with keeping the data locally), we
needed a novel solution, because, for instance, a chromosome
will typically be decomposed into millions of segments in a HAL
graph. In Section 3, we describe pre-generating interpolated
HAL graphs that store only as much information as is Visible
on the screen at different zoom levels, and demonstrate that we
achieve constant load times for Web pages at all levels of reso-
lution using the method.

2.2.3 Managing alignments and lifted annotations A unique fea-
ture of comparative assembly hubs is that all annotations can be
Viewed, through the alignment, from any genome. To make
managing the large number of possible snake and lifted-over
annotations easy, for each browser, a central conﬁguration
page is provided that uses a grid layout as its basis (Fig. 3).
This configuration page layout is adapted from the UCSC
Encode Browser [Rosenbloom et al. (2010)] where, instead of
using it to select tracks from combinations of cell line
and assay types, it is instead used to select from the combination
of genomes and (lifted-over) tracks, laid out phylogenetically
(if a tree is provided). As with the Encode browser, the
grid is sufﬁciently compact to display hundreds of tracks on a

page.

2.2.4 UCSC browser integration A key benefit of comparative
assembly hubs is their integration with the popular UCSC brow-
ser and the tools it provides. For example, export of subregions
of the alignment and track intersections can be made Via the
UCSC table browser (Karolchik et al. 2004), and, Via user ses-
sions, individual browser displays can be shared (see the supple-
ment for links to examples). Users may also add additional
tracks using the ‘Custom Tracks’ function.

of E.coli KOllFL 52593. The colored horizontal bars on top of each snake track indicate duplications in K01 1FL S2593 [two copies of each gene pﬂA
(green), pﬂB-L (green) and ple-S (orange)]. There is a large deletion in the parent strain W 162011, as this strain does not contain the pdc-ath-cat
insert. Following the snake track of K01 1FL 162099, there are 20 copies of (pﬂA, pﬂB-L, cat, ath, pdc and pde—S). As K01 1FL 52593 has two copies
of pﬂA, pﬂB-L and pﬂB-S the display arbitrarily picks one copy of each to map corresponding K01 1FL 162099 orthologous genes to. The text on the

2.3 Constructing the core and pan E.coli/Shigella genome

As a demonstration of the ﬂexibility of comparative assembly
hubs and the recently introduced pangenome displays it incorp-
orates (Nguyen et al. 2014), we created a comparative assembly
hub representing the core E.c0li/Shigella genome. Brieﬂy, this
was achieved by requiring that every alignment block contains
sequence from every input genome (see the Supplementary
Materials). As the pangenome display algorithm generates a con-
sensus ordering (even if the blocks correspond to the core
genome rather than the wider pangenome), this is reﬂected in
our core genome display (see Fig. 4).

We computed a core genome of size 2.7 Mb, which is consist-
ent with the 2.7 Mb core genome for 44 E.c0li/Shigella genomes
reported in Sahl et al. (2011) and the 2.9 Mb core genome for 16

E.c0li/Shigella reported in Darling et al. (2010). Both studies
used the whole-genome alignment approach. The core genome
size has been observed to decrease, but progressively plateau as
the number of genomes increases [Leimbach et al. (2013);
Lukjancenko et al. (2010); Touchon et al. (2009)]; this trend is
recapitulated here, as shown in Supplementary Figure S1. In
contrast to the core genome, the pangenome for the 66 strains
is ~11 Mb (Supplementary Fig. S3) and continues to grow rela-
tively linearly as new genomes are added.

The average size of an E.c0li/Shigella genome is ~5 Mb,
~86% of which is genes. Approximately (assuming that the
genes are evenly distributed across the genome), we expect 2.3
Mb (86% of 2.7 Mb) of the core genome to be genic, which
corresponds to ~2300 genes. This is consistent with the average

Fig. 4. The E.coli/Shigella core genome browser, showing the highly conserved ordering relationships between blocks of the E.coli core genome and the
less conserved ordering in Shigella. Most E.coli look like the ﬁrst snake track (E24377), with no high-level rearrangements (for space only one is shown).
In contrast, the Shigella has, with respect to E.coli, a fragmented core genome (second snake track SbCDC 308394, again, only one shown for lack of

space)

number of genes of each genome we observed to be overlapped
with the core genome (2348 and 2507 genes for 98% and 90%
minimum coverage cutoffs, respectively).

Remarkably, the core genome is, at a high level (10 kb or greater
block size, approximately), entirely un-rearranged in the majority
of E.coli genomes, despite the dramatic differences between them
in their wider pangenome. The striking converse of the ordering
conservation in E.coli is demonstrated by the Shigella genomes,
which (as shown in the figure) are signiﬁcantly reorderedithough
the summary allows a complete tracing of this reordering.

3.2 Snake display algorithm

A snake plot puts all the query segments within a reference chromosome
range on a set of one or more horizontal rows, indexed from 1 to n,
arranged top down. Before the algorithm is started, all the segments
are placed in a list, sorted by their starting coordinate on the query,
and the current row index is set to 1. Then, in a recursive fashion, the
algorithm places the ﬁrst segment in the list on the current row. The
algorithm then iterates through the list of segments, and for each segment
adds it to the current row if it does not overlap the previous segment on
the current row and is either in the same order and orientation as the
previous segment added to the current row, or will not have an adjacency
incident with either of its sides that would connect it to a segment on the
current row (thus avoiding making adjacencies between segments on a
single row that are not in the same order and orientation). The current
row index is then increased by 1, all segments that were placed on the
previous row removed from the list, and the process repeated recursively
until the list of segments is empty. Once all the segments have been drawn
on their respective row, lines are drawn between the segment sides to
show the adjacencies between the segments.

3.3 Procedural LOD algorithm

To display snake tracks usefully at all resolutions, from individual bases
to whole chromosomes, we compute multiple representations of the
original alignment at different LODs. Here we formalize this problem,
describe our sampling-based solution and demonstrate its performance in
practice.

3 .3 .1 Problem definition We begin by brieﬂy introducing the
deﬁnition of a sequence graph [more details in Paten et al. (2011)]. In a
sequence graph G, each sequence s e S in the alignment (chromosome,
contig, etc.) is represented by a string of DNA, which is, in turn, parti-
tioned into segments. All homologous segments are grouped together into
maximal gapless alignment blocks. Each segment within an alignment
block is associated with a strand identiﬁer to specify whether the forward
or reverse strand of the segment is being aligned. Let |G| refer to the
number of blocks in G. When comparing two different sequence graphs
of the same input data, GI and G2, we deﬁne A(GI, G2) to be the sum of
pairwise base homologies induced by the blocks of GI and not G2 and
those induced by the blocks of G2 and not GI.

Sequence graphs are conceptually equivalent to HAL graphs. Using
this equivalence, we deﬁne the interpolation problem as follows. Given a
sequence graph G and bound K, compute a sequence graph G’ such that
|G’| 5 K and A(G’, G) are minimal. In practice, K is a function of the
number of pixels in the browser display, and is 100 by default. Because of
the size of the search space (all graphs with 5 K blocks), we use the
following sampling-based solution.

3.3.2 Sampling the column graph We use a down-sampling algo-
rithm based on the simplifying assumption that alignment block lengths
are roughly uniform: if the total length of all blocks in G is LII”, then we
expect that each block in G’ will have length approximately
LbIock = L,,,,/K. The ﬁrst step of the algorithm is therefore to sample an
initial graph G0 from G by sampling every LbIock bases of each s e S and
extracting the block of length 1 from G into GO (if it has not been added
already).

To keep the number of sampled blocks proportional to K, we disregard
sampled blocks whose maximum distance (along any segment) to any
block already sampled is less than LbIock.

3.3.3 Extending the column graph Unless LbIock = 1, G0 will not
necessarily be a valid sequence graph, as it will not contain all bases in S.
We therefore greedin extend each block in G0 using the following rules,
creating G1. Let s[i] refer to the i’" base of sequence s. We deﬁne a
segment e as a closed interval of base coordinates (i, j) where i 5 j on
sequence s e S. Recall that because blocks are gapless, all segments con-
tained in a given block must always have the same length. If e is on the
forward strand in its containing block and s[j-l- 1] exists (j -l- 1 is a valid
coordinate) and is not already present in G1, or if e is on the reverse
strand and s[i — 1] exists and is not already in G1, then e can be extended
to the right. A similar check can determine whether e can be extended to
the left. G1 is constructed by, for each block in G0, maximally extending
all segments it contains by the same length in each direction. To avoid
expanding tiny gaps, we greedily extend blocks in reverse order based on
the number of sequences they contain.

3.3.4 Filling in missing blocks We can only extend each block by the
minimum length allowed for any segment it contains, and G1 will there-
fore still not necessarily contain every position of the input sequences. We
complete the procedure by creating a block for each maximal length
sequence not yet present in a block. Finally, we exhaustively merge to-
gether all pairs of blocks that have the same length such that the resulting
set of pairwise homologies induced by the merged blocks are all also
induced by the blocks in G.

3.3.5 LOD creation Pseudocode for the interpolation procedure
described in the steps above is provided in Algorithm 1. The time com-
plexity is O(N-l- |G’|log |G’|), where N is the number of bases in G and
|G’| is the number of blocks in the output. The O(N) component derives
from the fact that each base is processed once when it is added to a block,
and the O(lG’llog |G’|) component stems from the sorted sets required to
extend and merge the blocks. A series of LODs can be generated from a
source graph G and is created as follows. The user speciﬁes the scaling
factor between two LODs and the maximum number of blocks B to
process per query, and the algorithm iteratively generates coarser
LODs until one is reached such that the entire alignment can be displayed
in B blocks. An API is provided such that browser queries are directed to
the most detailed LOD such that the expected number of blocks returned
is less than B.

3.3.6 Experimental results The LOD generation algorithm was used
to generate the E.coli/Shigella comparative assembly hub discussed
above, using default parameters that attempt to limit queries to 100
blocks per pairwise alignment. This resulted in the creation of eight
LODs, whose sizes and associated query lengths are listed in Table 1.
The ﬁrst line of this table corresponds to the original alignment ﬁle, which
is used to display browser queries of size up to 4304 bases. Each succes-
sive line corresponds to the next coarser grained LOD generated by the
interpolation algorithm. We found that these LODs, whose sizes decrease
exponentially, were sufﬁcient to allow smooth transitions while zooming.

We assessed the practical impact of the LOD generation by simulating
1000 random browser queries for alignments of four E.coli/Shigella
strains (W 162011, KOllFL 162099, KOllFL 52593 and Ss53) to the
E.coli pangenome reference. The size and location of the queries were
unifome distributed across the ~10 mb of the reference genome. The
hub was hosted at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (La Jolla,
California, USA), whereas the Browser server was located at the
University of California Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, California, USA),
and no data were cached between individual queries. Each random
query was run on the hub twice: once with LOD activated (Fig. 5, blue
dots) and once without (red dots). The results are grouped, by query
length, into bins of size 1000000 along the x-axis where bin N contains
queries in the range (N-1000000, N). The average time required for a
query in each bin in seconds is reported in the ﬁgure, with the minimum
and maximum query times shown in the error bars. It is apparent from
the chart that without LOD, queries quickly become impractical as the
length approaches a megabase, but with LOD, the time remains relatively
constant for queries of any size.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this article, we have shown how UCSC comparative assembly
hubs can be easily constructed to provide useful extensible brow-
sers for sets of evolutionarily related genomes.

The comparative assembly hub framework is novel in several
respects. All the alignments and lifted-over annotations shown
are mutually consistent with one another, because, for the first
time, the annotation lift-over and alignment display is symmet-
rically driven by one reference-free alignment process, rather
than a mixture of different pairwise and reference-based multiple
alignments. The multiple alignment process and HAL format,
being reference free, also allow us to make all the browsers
equivalently powerful, in that all the annotations and alignments

Notes. Default parameters were used, setting the maximum expected blocks, K, to
100 and the ratio between LOD sizes to 3.9, requiring eight additional LOD align—
ments to be computed. LOD range is the query range on the browser for which the
LOD applies. Lb,an is the interpolation step size computed from K. The remaining
columns report the average number of blocks per pairwise alignment, the average
block length and the overall ﬁle sizes in megabytes, respectively. All block lengths
are in number of bases. Because of the heuristic steps used to generate, the sampled
graph (particularly ‘Filling in Missing Blocks’), the number of blocks in each LOD
decreases more slowly than K, but still exponentially.

can be displayed from any vantage point. The snake tracks for
the first time in the history of the UCSC browser and (to our
knowledge) a linear display format fully express all the possible
mutation types in one track, while the procedural LOD makes
this useful at all resolution levels. The incorporation of the pan-
genome display gives a new View of the data that, for some
purposes, is more useful for display than any single genome.

which recapitulates earlier results and Visually demonstrates the
many rearrangements present in the core genome of the Shigella
phylogroup. Though any aligner can in principle be used, in the
Supplementary Materials we demonstrate that the Cactus align-
ment program we used here (and which had not previously been
applied to bacterial genomes) is able to successfully align the vast
majority (99%) of known genes and operons in this clade.

One issue with the display of assembly hubs in general is that
the data must be transferred across the Internet. By using LOD
and caching we have attempted to make page load times reason-
able; however, one way to avoid this bottleneck and avoid con-
ﬁguring the installation of a mirror Web site is to run the
browser server in a Virtual machine. The UCSC browser in a
box scheme (http : / / genome. ucsc.edu/ goldenPath/ help / gbib),
which is under development, should make this easy and be com-
plementary to assembly hubs, allowing their display locally and
potentially securely within a ﬁrewalled environment.

We have also tested comparative assembly hubs with clades of
mammalian genomes (see links to online run-time analysis in the
methods) therefore it is feasible to use comparative assembly
hubs for even large projects, provided signiﬁcant computational
resources are available in the form of compute clusters. To make
the tool practical for vertebrate genomics communities without
these resources one future aim of the project is to provide a cloud
service, where users could buy compute time to generate their
alignments.

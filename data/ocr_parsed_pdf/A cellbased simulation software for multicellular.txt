ABSTRACT

CellSys is a modular software tool for efficient off-lattice simulation
of growth and organization processes in multi-cellular systems in 2D
and 3D. It implements an agent-based model that approximates cells
as isotropic, elastic and adhesive objects. Cell migration is modeled
by an equation of motion for each cell. The software includes many
modules specifically tailored to support the simulation and analysis
of virtual tissues including real-time 3D visualization and VRML 2.0
support. All cell and environment parameters can be independently
varied which facilitates species specific simulations and allows for
detailed analyses of growth dynamics and links between cellular and
multi-cellular phenotypes.

Availability: CellSys is freely available for non-commercial use at
http://msysbio.com/software/cellsys. The current version of CellSys
permits the simulation of growing monolayer cultures and avascular
tumor spheroids in liquid environment. Further functionality will be
made available ongoing with published papers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Based on the insight that multi-cellular systems are inherently of
multi-scale nature, the focus of research in systems biology is
currently shifting towards studies of whole cells or populations
of cells to complement sequence analysis (Yu et (11., 2002),
gene expression proﬁles (Missal et (11., 2006), research on signal
transduction pathways (Swameye et al., 2003) and the analysis of
biochemical systems (Calzone et al., 2006). Realistic multi-cellular
approaches should permit both, to include models of sub-cellular
processes and to simulate up to biologically or clinically relevant
population sizes. For many years, this was hampered by the inherent
computational complexity. However, depending on the level of
represented detail the steadily increasing computational power of
modern processors (CPUs and GPUs) today permits the simulation
of up to several millions of cells by agent-based models (Anderson
et (11., 2007; Drasdo et al., 2007 and refs. therein) provided an
efﬁcient implementation especially in three dimensions.

Here we present an adaptable software tool (named CellSys) that
implements a class of lattice-free agent-based models permitting
realistic simulations of tissue growth and organization processes
of common experimental settings in vitro, as the growth dynamics
in monolayer cultures and multi-cellular spheroids (Drasdo and

Hoehme, 2005). It has ﬁirther recently been used to model liver
regeneration (Hoehme et al., 2007, 2010). Therein, the simulation
results from CellSys have been directly and quantitatively compared
to experimental data, using the same analysis methods for both.
CellSys can be used to predict the experiments that are most
informative to identify possible mechanisms on the cell and sub-
cell scale to explain a certain multi-cellular phenomenon. It also
has proved useful to guide the development of continuous models
where cells are not resolved individually but are represented by
locally averaged quantities: Comparing both model types permits
identiﬁcation of terms and parameters (Byme and Drasdo, 2009).

2 SIMULATION MODEL

Each individual cell is modeled by an isotropic, elastic and adhesive
sphere capable of migration, growth and division. Cell—cell and cell—
matrix interaction are mimicked by the experimentally validated
(Chu et al., 2005) Johnson—Kendall—Roberts (JKR) model that
summarizes deformation, compression and adhesion forces, and
displays hysteresis if cells move close to or away from one
another. Model cells are parameterized by the Young modulus,
the Poisson ratio, the density of membrane receptors responsible
for cell—cell and cell—substrate adhesion and by its (intrinsic)
radius. Proliferating cells double volume and deform into dumb-
bells after a given number of time steps before splitting into two
daughter cells. By assuming that inertia terms can be neglected,
cell migration is modeled by an (Langevin-) equation of motion
for each cell center summarizing all JKR-forces on that cell, the
friction-forces with substrate or extracellular matrix as well as with
other cells (parameterized by friction coefﬁcients), and optionally a
random force term. The latter mimics cell micro-motility and is
quantiﬁed by the cell diffusion constant. We solve the equation
for diffusion and consumption of nutrients, growth factors, etc.
on a lattice using the Euler forward method while fulﬁlling the
Courant—Friedrichs—Lewy condition (Drasdo and Hoehme, 2005)
[for further details, see Supplementary Material (Section 3)]. CellSys
also supports the modeling of dynamically varying cell parameters
and different cell types as demonstrated for growing cell populations
in tissue like environments (submitted for publication). Since
the model is completely parameterized in terms of measurable
quantities, intracellular control modules can readily be integrated
within CellSys by direct coupling the molecular concentrations of
intracellular chemicals to the cell-level parameters (Ramis-Conde
et (11., 2008, 2009). Most recently, we used CellSys to predict a
so far unknown mechanism in liver regeneration after toxic damage
that could be subsequently validated experimentally (Hoehme et al.,
2007, 2010).

3 SOFTWARE

CellSys is a software tool that efﬁciently integrates modeling,
simulation, observation and visualization functionality for
individual-cell (agent)-based models. It is implemented in portable
object-oriented ANSI C++ and thus binaries are available for
many operating systems including all recent Windows and Linux
variants. A graphical user interface (GUI) that provides real-time
visualization of models in 3D based on OpenGL (Fig. 1A) also serves
to access the ﬁinctionality of the software. CellSys is organized in
encapsulated modules that lay the foundation for its extensibility
and maintainability. Currently, it consists of the following main
components: (i) basic classes formulating the major abstractions
such as model cells or ﬁnite grid elements; (ii) a collection of
core algorithms implementing model variants for cellular behavior
such as cell-migration or cell-cycle-control; (iii) algorithms for
modeling the cellular environment; (iv) modules for observing; and
(v) visualizing properties of the cell population and its environment.
During the model simulations, CellSys currently automatically
permits taking over 60 different observables. Additionally, CellSys
is able to output scene descriptions for example in VRML 2.0
or in the script language used in the popular open-source ray
tracer PovRay (povray.org) (Fig. 1B). We use the libraries zlib
(zlib.net) and libtiff (libtiff.org) to save screenshots, videos and
zip-compressed model states in predeﬁned intervals.

The cross-platform GUI is based on the GLUI library
(glui.sourceforge.net) and is used to change parameter settings
and control the software components (1—5). It allows users to
interactively explore model states and, e.g. mark speciﬁc properties
of cells and their environment. Thereby scalar properties are
often mapped to RGB-color vectors as illustrated in Figure 1 and
vector-based properties are visualized using 2D or 3D vector ﬁelds.

The core algorithms in CellSys are parallelized using OpenMP
(openmp.org) to exploit the computational power of modern shared

memory multi-core multi-processor machines. The solution of the
stochastic equations of motion (Langevin) is supported by the
multithreaded version of SuperLU for shared-memory parallel
machines (crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU). We ﬁnd the solution of
the equations of motion and the neighbor detection to be the
major performance bottlenecks of lattice-free individual-cell-based
models. On an Intel Core Duo E8500 system with 8GB RAM a
typical simulation from 1 to 105 cells e.g. takes 44h (2D, 1 core),
125 h (3D, 1 core) or 41 h (3D, 4 cores). However, runtimes greatly
depend on parameter and algorithm choices. For a more detailed
introduction refer to the Supplementary Material.

4 SUMMARY/OUTLOOK

CellSys offers a robust and efﬁcient implementation of a lattice-free
individual-cell-based model that is parameterized by experimentally
measurable quantities. The current version allows the in silico
simulation and analysis of widespread experimental settings in
2D and 3D such as monolayer cultures and multi-cellular tumor
spheroids. Speciﬁc cell lines and culturing settings can be
mimicked by changing parameters accordingly. The results of
model simulations can be visualized by a wide variety of virtual
stainings and are quantiﬁed by many observables. The modular,
object-oriented structure of the software permits extensions like the
modeling of the surrounding tissue or vascular networks that will be
made available in ﬁiture versions of CellSys.

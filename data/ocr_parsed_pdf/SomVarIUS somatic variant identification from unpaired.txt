Abstract

Motivation: Somatic variant calling typically requires paired tumor—normal tissue samples. Yet,
paired normal tissues are not always available in clinical settings or for archival samples.

Results: We present SomVarlUS, a computational method for detecting somatic variants using
high throughput sequencing data from unpaired tissue samples. We evaluate the performance of
the method using genomic data from synthetic and real tumor samples. SomVarlUS identifies
somatic variants in exome—seq data of ~150 x coverage with at least 67.7% precision and 64.6% re—
call rates, when compared with paired—tissue somatic variant calls in real tumor samples. We dem—
onstrate the utility of SomVarlUS by identifying somatic mutations in formalin—fixed samples, and
tracking clonal dynamics of oncogenic mutations in targeted deep sequencing data from pre— and
post—treatment leukemia samples.

Availability and implementation: SomVarlUS is written in Python 2.7 and available at http://www.

1 Introduction

Assessment of somatic and germ line mutations to tailor personal-
ized diagnosis and treatment is becoming a corner stone for preci-
sion medicine in oncology initiatives (Collins and Varmus, 2015;
Sboner and Elemento, 2015). Somatic mutations are typically de-
tected by comparing sequencing data from target (e.g. tumor) and
matched control tissues (e.g. benign tissue from the same patient).
Initiatives such as the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Genomic Mutation
Calling Challenge have shown that popular algorithms can detect
somatic mutations from paired tumor-normal tissue samples with
reasonably high accuracy (Boutros et (11., 2014). However, in many
practical situations matched control tissues are not available, and it
remains challenging to distinguish between somatic and germ line
variants in those cases. For instance, matched normal samples are

not routinely obtained in clinical care (Meric—Bernstam et (11., 2015).
Additionally, a considerable proportion of the older FFPE and fresh
frozen tumor samples have no matched control tissues available.
Popular variant calling tools are not designed to identify somatic
and germ line variants from unpaired tissue samples, and there have
been only limited efforts to detect somatic mutations from unpaired
samples (Sun et (11., 2014).

We present SomVarlUS, a computational method for detecting
somatic variants using high throughput sequencing data from un-
paired tissue samples. SomVarIUS accepts sorted alignment files
(.bam) as input, and outputs predicted somatic mutations in the
variant call format (.vcf), thereby enabling its easy integration
into any standard genome analysis pipeline. It also generates an op-
tional output providing information about the status of known

denser catalog of SNPs, which will be helpful. Nevertheless, we rec—
ommend using samples with sufficient sequencing coverage (e.g.
2100><) for somatic mutation detection from unpaired samples with
SomVarlUS. We will also improve the clonality assessment using
copy number information, similar to that implemented elsewhere
(Miller et al., 2014; Qiao et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2014). Finally,
SomVarIUS is not intended to replace the paired—sample variant call—
ing tools; rather it provides a useful utility for identifying potential
somatic mutations when paired tissues are not available.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Automated image processing has allowed cell migration
research to evolve to a high-throughput research field. As a conse-
quence, there is now an unmet need for data management in this
domain. The absence of a generic management system for the quan-
titative data generated in cell migration assays results in each dataset
being treated in isolation, making data comparison across experi-
ments difficult. Moreover, by integrating quality control and analysis
capabilities into such a data management system, the common prac-
tice of having to manually transfer data across different downstream
analysis tools will be markedly sped up and made more robust. In
addition, access to a data management solution creates gateways
for data standardization, meta-analysis and structured public data
dissemination.

We here present CellMissy, a cross-platform data management
system for cell migration data with a focus on wound healing data.
CellMissy simpliﬁes and automates data management, storage and
analysis from the initial experimental set-up to data exploration.
Availability and implementation: CellMissy is a cross-platform open-
source software developed in Java. Source code and cross-platform
binaries are freely available under the Apache2 open source license at

1 INTRODUCTION

Dynamic cell motility processes are essential for morphogenesis,
immune responses, wound healing and cancer metastasis (Friedl
et al., 2009). Investigation of the mechanisms and modes of cell
migration is therefore important for fundamental scientiﬁc
insight and for translational research, as molecules involved in
deregulated cell migration are attractive targets for therapeutic
intervention. As a result, the field has developed methods for
the systematic high-throughput analysis of cell migration,
with wound healing-like assays currently most amenable to mul-
tiple condition comparison or high-throughput approaches

(Ashby et al., 2012; Hulkower et al., 2011). In these assays, a
cell layer is allowed to move into a cell-free region, and the
decrease in time of this area reﬂects cell migration velocity.
The cell-free zone can be created (Riahi et al., 2012) by scratching
a confluent cell layer [typical wound healing assay (Liang et al.,
2007)] or by using non-damaging barriers during cell seeding [cell
exclusion zone assay (Gough et al., 2011)]. Advanced micro-
scopes then allow automatic acquisition of images of the migrat-
ing cells, and specialized image processing tools are used to
quantify cell migration features from these images (Table 1).
Speciﬁc solutions for tackling the problems in large-scale image
management and storage have additionally been reported
(de Chaumont et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2008). However, a
major current challenge in the cell migration field lies in the
development of suitable software for the annotation, manage-
ment and sharing of the quantiﬁcation data obtained from
such imaging-based experiments. Although software tools are
available to help with several of the steps in this workﬁow,
several key functions currently remain unmet (see Table 1). We
here present CellMissy, a cross-platform system for the annota-
tion, storage, analysis and dissemination of quantitative cell
migration data. It aids the user with experimental set-up and
annotation, generic data import/export (downstream from
image processing) and subsequent data storage, inspection and
analysis. It thus provides support for the entire experimental
workﬁow, when coupled to an image analysis algorithm of
choice (Fig. 1, Table 1). CellMissy is intended to facilitate local
storage and analysis of acquired data, but it also provides the
basic infrastructure for improved annotation, standardization
and dissemination in the migration ﬁeld, ultimately enabling
re-analyses and meta-analyses to take place. The beneﬁt of
the latter has already been proven in other ﬁelds, where data
management and dissemination infrastructure are more mature
(Matic et al., 2012; Martens, 2011). The development of user-
oriented freely available data storage and analysis systems for
cell migration data thus provides an important and timely next
step for the ﬁeld.

2 TOOL DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONALITY

CellMissy is a client-server application with a graphical user
interface (GUI) on the client and a relational database in the
back-end to store the data (Supplementary Fig. 81). It is
developed to follow the steps typically encountered in a cell
migration experiment (Fig. 1 and Table 1) and is composed

Fig. 1. Schematic workﬂow of a typical wound healing experiment
demonstrating the tasks for which the different modules (A, C and D)
from CellMissy are used to manage, import and analyze data of images

that are acquired independently by an experimental set-up and image
processing tool of choice (B)

of three modules: the experiment manager, the data loader and
the data analyzer. CellMissy handles wound healing-like data
obtained from different experimental set-ups and after processing
with different image analysis software (see Table 1). CellMissy
takes either generic text ﬁles as input or can be customized to
load data from image acquisition software automatically.

CellMissy is written entirely in Java, and uses Swing for the
GUI, the Spring framework for the logic layer and Hibernate
for communication with the database.

2.1 Experiment manager—experimental set-up

This module (Fig. 1A) is used to set up a cell migration experi-
ment. Its main interface element is a graphical presentation of a
user-deﬁnable multi-well plate. For a certain biological condi-
tion, one or more wells representing technical replicates can be
selected. Different informative metadata variables (e. g. cell line,
treatment compound and dose) can be supplied for each condi-
tion. The resulting plate layout, well assignments and metadata
are all stored in the database. To our knowledge, CellMissy con-
stitutes the ﬁrst tool in the community that provides the possi-
bility to extensively annotate and customize the experimental
set-up. CellMissy can also export the experimental design in
PDF form for use in the laboratory, to actually set up the ex-
periment and proceed to sample preparation. Furthermore, it is
possible to retrieve set-up settings from previously stored experi-
ments, thus accelerating the process of planning new experiments
or setting up a replicate experiment. Templates containing all
metadata information from the set-up can in addition be ex-
ported as an XML ﬁle, which can be shared between researchers
and re-imported, thus allowing for comparison between different
set-ups and promoting data exchange and dissemination.

2.2 Data loader—data import and storage

As shown in Figure 1B, the user then performs laboratory-
dedicated image acquisition and processing (see Table 1 for
choice set-ups and image processing tools), thus producing the
input data for CellMissy (see Supplementary Section S2.1).
Data import and storage are handled by the data loader module
(Fig. 1C) that either reads a generic text-based data input format
or can be fully automated if tailored to the chosen combination of
set-up/image processing tool. CellMissy expects at least one tab-
separated text ﬁle for each well, listing the time and the associated
area values. Multiple files can be loaded per well, allowing differ-
ent imaging locations, the application of different imaging tech-
niques (e. g. phase contrast, ﬂuorescence) or the import of data
from different image analysis algorithms for that single well.
Importantly, CellMissy again provides a means to export an
entire experiment to an XML ﬁle at this level, i.e. with all acquired
data. This XML ﬁle can be shared with other researchers (e. g. as
Supplementary Information), directly re-imported by any
CellMissy user, thus enabling easy exchange of data, re-analysis
and reproduction of the results.

2.3 Data analyzer—data interpretation and reporting

The data analyzer module (Fig. 1D) guides the user through data
analysis and interpretation. Table 1 demonstrates the extra fea-
tures of CellMissy compared with the two reported tools dedi-
cated to wound healing data analysis. The analysis in TScratch
(Geback et al, 2009) is an extension of the TScratch image pro-
cessing, whereas CellMissy uniquely combines more extensive
analysis of wound healing with data storage and management
and possibilities for data dissemination (see above). The analysis
consists ﬁrst of a pre-processing step to normalize raw data rela-
tive to the area at time 0 (see Supplementary Section S2.1). The
next step handles quality control (for full details, see
Supplementary Section S2.2). For each technical replicate, arti-
facts in area increase between time steps are detected and Visua-
lized using a kernel density estimator (Supplementary Fig. S5).
The variation between technical replicates is examined using
Euclidean distance (Supplementary Fig. S6). In each step, the
user can accept or reject the suggested correction. A linear regres-
sion model then extracts slope and R2 value on a replicate level.
The median slope across replicates then yields the median migra-
tion velocity for a condition. All pair-wise differences in median
velocity between a set of user-selected conditions are subsequently
analyzed using a Mann7Whitney U test with a choice of multiple
hypothesis testing correction (Bonferroni or Benjamini7
Hochberg) (Supplementary Section S2.3). The architecture of
CellMissy is, in addition, fully pluggable for analysis algorithms.
This means that different distance metrics, statistical tests, kernel
density estimators, outlier detection methods and multiple hy-
pothesis correction methods can be added by any interested de-
veloper. Such new methods can be plugged dynamically into
CellMissy, and will subsequently be immediately available to the
user from the CellMissy interface. Finally, CellMissy produces a
detailed PDF report that summarizes experimental design details,
acquired data, corresponding results and statistical evaluation.

3 CONCLUSIONS

CellMissy is a novel, cross-platform, generic data management
and analysis system for cell migration experiments. CellMissy is
freely available, ﬂexible in linking to upstream experimental set-
ups and image processing tools, easily extensible and automates
data handling, processing, quality monitoring and interpretation.
Its intuitive interface provides support from the experimental set-
up to the final reporting of the analysis including statistics. Data
in CellMissy can be exported from one system and re-loaded in
another system, enabling easy data sharing. In addition, it pro-
vides a framework for tool expansion toward future meta-ana-
lyses on data generated by multiple users, making it possible, for
example, to compare all drug effects on cells of a particular
cancer present in a shared CellMissy database. CellMissy is
released as open source under the permissive Apache2 license.

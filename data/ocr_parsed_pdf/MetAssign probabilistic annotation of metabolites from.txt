ABSTRACT

Motivation: The use of liquid chromatography coupled to mass spec-
trometry has enabled the high-throughput profiling of the metabolite
composition of biological samples. However, the large amount of data
obtained can be difficult to analyse and often requires computational
processing to understand which metabolites are present in a sample.
This article looks at the dual problem of annotating peaks in a sample
with a metabolite, together with putatively annotating whether a me-
tabolite is present in the sample. The starting point of the approach is
a Bayesian clustering of peaks into groups, each corresponding to
putative adducts and isotopes of a single metabolite.

Results: The Bayesian modelling introduced here combines informa-
tion from the mass-to-charge ratio, retention time and intensity of each
peak, together with a model of the inter-peak dependency structure,
to increase the accuracy of peak annotation. The results inherently
contain a quantitative estimate of confidence in the peak annotations
and allow an accurate trade-off between precision and recall.
Extensive validation experiments using authentic chemical standards
show that this system is able to produce more accurate putative iden-
tifications than other state-of-the-art systems, while at the same time
giving a probabilistic measure of confidence in the annotations.
Availability and implementation: The software has been imple-
mented as part of the szatch metabolomics analysis pipeline,
which is available for download at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The metabolome, being the entire set of metabolites in a biolo-
gical system, is a highly informative descriptor of the physio-
logical state of an organism, and understanding the dynamics
of the metabolome is essential for a wide range of biomedical
applications.

Major advances have been made recently in the development
of high-throughput assays to measure the metabolome (Zhou
et al., 2012). One of the most popular methods for this purpose

is mass spectrometry (MS), coupled to a chromatographic sep-
aration, such as liquid chromatography (LC). The output of the
LCiMS process is a set of peaks, characterized by their mass per
unit charge and their chromatographic retention time. For
almost all subsequent analysis to be undertaken, these measured
peaks have to be annotated (i.e. matched to the particular me-
tabolites that produced them). Accurate reliable peak annotation
and metabolite identification is currently the greatest challenge in
high-throughput metabolomics (Dunn et al., 2012). In this
article, the terms ‘identiﬁcation’ and ‘annotation’ are used in
the sense speciﬁed by the chemical analysis working group of
the metabolomics standards initiative, where identiﬁcation
means a positive comparison with an authentic standard using
two or more measured quantities (e. g. mass and retention time)
and annotation means a positive comparison with compounds
using physicochemical properties or spectral databases (Sumner
et al., 2007).

Tandem MS (or, more generally, MS”) and comparison with
authentic standards are two common approaches to providing
robust metabolite identiﬁcations (Sumner et al., 2007). For
global untargeted metabolomics, comparison of each detected
metabolite with an authentic standard rapidly becomes infeasible
(through cost and availability of standards). Fragmentation
methods including MS/MS and MS” are powerful, but rely on
libraries of fragmentation patterns of authentic standards (Horai
et al., 2010; Ridder et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2005). However,
fragment patterns are often similar between isomers of the same
compound. Fragmentation prediction algorithms exist (Wolf
et al., 2010) but are limited in similarity to standards-derived
fragment patterns.

There are three key factors that make peak annotation and
metabolite identiﬁcation difﬁcult. First, the finite mass accuracy
of the MS equipment and the large number of potential formulas
results in multiple possible mass-matches for each observed peak
(Kind and Fiehn, 2006). Second, each metabolite in the sample
being measured may produce many peaks, including isotopolo-
gues, adducts, molecular fragments and multiply charged ions
(Scheltema et al., 2009). These peaks form a dependency struc-
ture and exacerbate the problem of overlapping database
matches; accounting for them in some manner is needed to
avoid an overwhelming number of false annotations. Finally,
many observed peaks will be the result of impurities and con-
taminants (Keller et al., 2008).

MetAssign: probabilistic annotation of metabolites

 

A considerable number of computational methods have
been developed to address the metabolite annotation challenge
(Benton et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2011; Creek et al., 2012; Dunn
et al., 2012; Weber and Viant, 2010). One of the main differences
among existing algorithms is how they treat derivative peaks and
their associated dependency structure. Some methods ignore
these relations altogether and match individual peaks against a
database (Scheltema et al., 2011). Others attempt to annotate
metabolites by first grouping peaks in some manner and then
assigning a putative annotation to the groups (e.g. Kuhl et al.,
2012; Lee et al., 2013). Additional types of data can also help,
e.g. predicted retention times of molecules have recently been
used to help in identiﬁcation (Creek et al., 2011). There has
also been much work on the use of multistage MS to produce
a ‘fragment tree’ that can be compared against hypothetical frag-
ment trees to contribute to the annotation (Ipsen et al., 2010a;
Rojas-Cherto et al., 2012).

As well as methods that attempt to improve accuracy by
taking into account inter-peak dependencies, there have also
been attempts to incorporate additional information not con-
tained within the spectra to improve annotation. For example,
Rogers et a]. (2009), Silva et a]. (2014) and Weber and Viant
(2010) all investigate the use of metabolic pathway information
to improve metabolite annotation.

One aspect that has been largely neglected so far is the inher-
ently uncertain nature of the metabolite annotation task. The
level of conﬁdence in putative annotations will vary across me-
tabolites and datasets. For example, the presence of several high-
quality peaks of an isotopic series at the same retention time that
all unambiguously point towards a particular metabolite should
result in a putative annotation that is given higher conﬁdence
than an annotation from an isolated noisy peak that could have
been produced by any one of a number of metabolites. So far,
there has been little effort in developing metabolite annotation
methods that provide a quantitative assessment of this uncer-
tainty/confidence in their outputs, with work limited to probabil-
istic models of isotope intensities (Becker et al., 2009; Ipsen et al.,
2010b), and our previous work (Rogers et al., 2009) (extended by
Silva et al., 2014) that relies on knowledge of active metabolic
pathways and requires every observed peak to be matched to
something in the database.

In this article, we address this shortfall by presenting a method
of putative metabolite annotation (MetAssign) that provides
probabilistic annotations of individual peaks, as well as a prob-
abilistic estimate of the presence/absence of particular metabol-
ites based on the integration of information from multiple peaks
(including isotopes and adducts). The main novelty of this
method is in how it explicitly models (through statistical cluster-
ing) the dependency structure between peaks in a particular ex-
periment. The method, built within the framework of statistical
mixture models, simultaneously groups peaks that are derived
from the same metabolite and provides a putative annotation
of this metabolite. As well as clustering dependant peaks, the
statistical framework of the model provides a natural manner
in which to combine the different sources of evidence contained
within the spectra (mass per charge, retention time and intensity).
MetAssign also opens the door to extensions to other data types,
discussed in Section 5.

Finally, we compare MetAssign with two widely used annota-
tion methods across a range of LCiMS datasets from standard
chemical mixtures, for which the constituents are known, and
demonstrate that the probabilities assigned by MetAssign are
well calibrated (the higher the probability, the more likely the
annotation is correct) and provide competitive putative annota-
tion performance.

2 APPROACH

Our proposed model adopts a Bayesian statistical approach to
peak annotation and metabolite annotation. In particular, we
consider annotation as a clustering problemvpeaks are clustered
into groups, each of which explicitly corresponds to a particular
chemical formula. At the peak level, the prior probability of a
particular annotation is computed Via a statistical model based
on mass similarity; this is precisely given by the mass likelihood
term below. The closer the measured mass to the theoretical
mass, the higher the probability. The cluster model described
below allows us to convert this prior annotation into a posterior
annotation that takes into account other observed peaks.
Posterior probabilities are given by cluster membership probabil-
ities. Figure 1 gives a diagrammatic illustration of this process.

In the following, we describe the statistical model in more
detail and show how the output of the cluster model can be
interpreted at both the peak annotation and metabolite annota-
tion levels.

2.1 Observed data and parameters

Each data replicate consists of N mass-chromatographic peaks.
Each peak is assumed to have been previously aligned (i.e.
matched up) with its corresponding peaks across all S replicates.
Each peak then consists of the mass-to-charge ratio, x”; the in-
tensity, w”; and the retention time, r”.

As well as data observed from experiments, there are also a
library of m = 1 . . . M possible metabolite formulas, from which
exact masses and predicted isotope proﬁles can be calculated
using a method similar to that described by Snider (2007).
Each profile consists of i = 1 . . . [ma isotopic indices, where each
index consists of the isotopic mass, ymai, and the isotopic distri-
bution value, ﬂm, (i.e. the predicted relative intensity based on
natural isotope abundances). In addition, possible adduct masses
and the corresponding isotope profiles can be calculated using a
list of a = 1 . . . A possible adduct rules. Each rule is a string such
as 2M -l- 3H, where 2M stands for two copies of the metabolite
(dimer) and -l- 3H stands for an extra 3 Hydrogen atoms (less
3 electrons).

2.2 Model description

The proposed model simultaneously groups related peaks and
assigns molecular formulas to the groups. Inference within the
model is performed Via a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo
sampling scheme, and the resulting posterior probabilities pro-
vide a robust measure of the conﬁdence in particular assign-
ments. An illustration of the state of the model during a
hypothetical inference is shown in Figure 2.

At any point in the sampling scheme, we might have K clus-
ters, each assigned to a molecular formula and having one or

Fig. 1. An example of improved peak annotation by MetAssign. The peak at m/z = 167.996769 has two possible database matches, L-Cysteate (which is
known to be in the sample) and 6-Chloro-1-hydroxybenzotriazole (which is known not to be in the sample). The prior likelihood of choosing L-Cysteate
over 6-Chloro-1-hydroxybenzotriazole is 17 over 83%, and by a nearest match criterion, the later would be selected. However, in the posterior, the ratios
change to 92 over 8%, as the MetAssign algorithm detects the conﬁrming presence of the sulphur-34 isotope peaks in the same cluster

more measured peaks assigned to it. Let the binary indicator
variable an = 1, if peak n is assigned to cluster k, and znk = 0
otherwise. Deﬁne ck=zn znk to be the total number of peaks
assigned to cluster k.

Within a cluster we must define the dependencies between
peaks, and therefore the exact theoretical peak that a particular
measured peak has been assigned to. For example, to use inten-
sity information, it is important to know which isotope peak a
particular measured peak is putatively assigned to. In addition,
we admit the possibility of multiple adducts in our model and
must therefore keep track of which particular adduct a particular
measured peak is assigned to. We therefore introduce a second
set of indicator variables, vnka, = 1, if the nth peak is assigned to
the ith isotope position of the ath adduct in the kth cluster. If
there are a total of I isotope peaks (note that in general this will
depend on the particular chemical formula) and A adducts:

an = Z Z Vnkai-

a=li=l

The cluster model takes the form of a mixture model, with a
Dirichlet process (DP) prior (e.g. Rasmussen, 2000) to avoid
having to specify the number of clusters (metabolites) a priori.
The conditional distributions required by the Gibbs sampler to
assign peak n to a current cluster (k) or a new cluster (k*) are
(note that for brevity we omit conditioning on hyperparameters):

P(an=1l---)0<Ckp(anan=1,---) (1)

P(an* = 1| . .  0( ap(d,,| .. (2)

where d” =(x,,, w", r”), ck is the number of peaks currently
assigned to cluster k, a is the DP concentration parameter and
p(d,,|z,,k = 1, . . .) is obtained by marginalizing over all low-level
assignments possible for the metabolite to which this cluster is
linked:

Fig. 2. An illustration of the state the model might be in during inference.
Three clusters have been highlighted, each grouping around a particular
retention time. One of the clusters is made up of two adducts. Each
adduct consists of a number of peaks corresponding to the isotopic dis-
tribution of the compound

where (pk =m if cluster k is linked to formula m and we assume
uniform priors over the Am x 1m possible adduct and isotope
assignments for formula m. To compute p(d,,| . . .) for new clus-
ters, we must also marginalize over formulas: see the
Supplementary document for information.

Our model assumes that p(d,,|v,,ka,- = 1, (pk, . . .) factorizes across
the three data types. For the mass term, we assume a Gaussian
density on the log of the mass (i.e. mass noise is proportional
to x”):

p(xnlvnkai=1I---)=N(10g xnllogycpkaiIé-Tl) 

where y¢km~ is the theoretical mass of the ith isotope peak of the
ath adduct for the formula assigned to cluster k, 4' is the expected
precision based on the known accuracy of the speciﬁc mass spec-
trometer used in an experiment, N(b, c) denotes a Gaussian
density with mean b and variance 6 and N(a|b, c) denotes that
density evaluated at a.

MetAssign: probabilistic annotation of metabolites

 

The intensity term is also Gaussian, but the density depends on
the intensities of other peaks currently assigned to this cluster. In
particular, we assume that the intensity of adduct a in cluster k,
Aka, is drawn from a Gaussian prior N00, K31). We set A0 to the
mean of observed intensities and K0 to 1014, resulting in a fairly
ﬁat prior over the region of interest. Individual peak intensities
are then assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian conditioned on
their adduct-isotope assignment wn~N(ﬂ¢ka,-Aka, K’l), where
134%,"- is the theoretical proportion of total intensity that would
be observed as isotope peak i and K=1078 is the observation
precision. Based on the peaks currently assigned to cluster k,
we can compute the posterior density over Aka (a Gaussian
with mean A,, and precision K*; details in Supplementary docu-
ment) and then marginalize over Aka to obtain the following
conditional density that can be used by the sampler:

p(w.Iv.Im.-= 1. . . .) =N(Wnlﬂ¢,.,-A*, x" mam-K3). (5)

For the retention time term, we assume the following genera-
tive model: the cluster retention time, lk, is assumed to be
drawn from N(/to,8gl), where no is the mean of the reten-
tion times in the data and 80 is 1075. Each peak retention time
is assumed to be [k with additive noise: rn~N(lk, y’l), where y
is given as 2.5 x 10". We can analytically compute the poster-
ior density for [k (a Gaussian with mean 0* and preci-
sion 8*; details in Supplementary document) and marginalize [k
to get:

p(rnlvnkaI-=1.---)=N(rn|/I*.8;l+r’l) (6)

p(d,,|z,,k = 1, . . .) is then given by the product of Equations (#6).
The quantity required for a new cluster is computed in a similar
manner, but with the posterior parameters replaced by their prior
counterparts (for r” and w”).

If a peak is assigned to a current cluster, it must then be as-
signed to a particular adductiisotope pair within that cluster.
The probability of isotope i and adduct a is:

P(v,,ka,- = llznk = l, d", .. o<p(d,,|v,,ka,-= l, . .  (7)

which can be decomposed as above. For a new cluster, we must
ﬁrst assign the cluster to a formula. This is done with:

p(¢* =m|znk* = l, . .  0(

71m 1“ A“ (8)
Am] 2

p(dnlvnk,aI-=1.¢* =1”. ...).
m i=la=l

 

where rim is the probability that a cluster will be assigned to
metabolite m (71m = 1 /M in our experiments), and the assignment
to adduct and isotope follows as in the previous case.

The Gibbs sampling algorithm proceeds by starting from a
random assignment of peaks into clusters (and particular assign-
ments therein) and then repeatedly re-sampling the assignment
for each peak with the various posteriors computed by ignoring
the peak being assigned. Note that in practice, the problem
is sparse. For each measured peak, the number of theoretical
peaks that it could be assigned to [i.e. peaks for which
p(x,,|v,,ka,- = 1, . . .) >0] is small and implementation can be made
highly efﬁcient.

This model description demonstrated how MetAssign uses the
dependencies present between peaks. To be clustered, peaks must

have similar retention times, explainable masses and correct in-
tensity relationships. This distinguishes the method from our
previous work (Rogers et al., 2009) and its extensions (Silva
et al., 2014) where, for example, peak retention times must be
within some tolerance of a theoretical value but are not con-
strained to be similar to one another.

2.3 Annotation probabilities

The output of the Gibbs sampling algorithm is a set of assign-
ments of peaks to a particular massiadductiindex combination
(maiFone for each sample iteration. Based on this, it is straight-
forward to compute the sample-based approximation to the mar-
ginal posterior probability that a measured peak is assigned to
any formula/adduct/isotope combination (described here as an
annotation). This output may be further adapted to get a better
measure of the probability that a measured peak was produced
by a chemical compound and was not merely noise. The way in
which this idea was implemented in MetAssign was as follows:
following each iteration of the Gibbs sampling scheme, we have a
series of clusters, each consisting of one or more peaks. For each
peak 11, such that n is currently assigned to cluster k, an indicator
variable g” e {0, 1} is calculated as follows:

1 if gi=l for all i in k that have
g" = a higher isotopic prevalance
0 otherwise

Thus, a peak is unlikely to be derived from a true metabolite if it
is assigned to be an isotopologue peak, but other expected peaks
of higher predicted abundance, e.g. the monoisotopic peak, are
not detected. In this case, these peaks can be ignored during
analysis, by simply using g” as the peak to metabolite
assignments.

On top of the peak sample output, our sampling scheme
allows us to produce highly interpretable probabilities of the
presence/absence of metabolites with particular chemical for-
mulas. By looking at clusters assigned to a particular formula,
we can provide a score for each formula at each sampling step.
These can then be averaged over the complete run of samples to
provide an overall conﬁdence that this particular formula is pre-
sent in the data. In the MetAssign program, this behaviour was
implemented as follows: at each sample, for each formula m, the
support for m is given as Sm = Ziem g1, that is, the support is the
number of ‘good’ peaks assigned to m. We then say that a for-
mula is supported at Level I if Sm 3 l. Intuitively, the more peaks
are assigned to a formula (e.g. as isotopologues or adducts),
the greater the chance that a metabolite with this formula is
present.

2.4 Using the MetAssign algorithm

Although the description of the statistical model and associated
inference algorithm used in MetAssign might seem daunting, the
use of the system and interpretation of the output is easy. For
each peak in a dataset, a probability that that peak comes from a
particular metaboliteiadductiisotope is given. Also, for each
compound in a putative database of compounds, the probability
that the compound is present in the measured sample is given.
The use of probabilities as opposed to deﬁnite (yes/no) results

might seem to complicate analysis, but in fact this gives a prac-
titioner extremely useful information that allows much greater
control in an analysis situation. For example, the user could sum
over all adducts and isotopes to ﬁnd the probability that a peak
comes from a particular metabolite, or they could use the max-
imum a posteriori assignment.

One particular scenario that MetAssign has been designed to
perform well in is in large untargeted scans, where a sample
contains a large number of metabolites and is being checked
against a large database. In situations such as these, common
annotation routines end up assigning many compounds to
many peaks, and extensive manual intervention is needed
(often on a peak-by-peak basis) to resolve inconsistencies that
occur. Coupled to this problem is the inverse problem of taking
annotations of peaks and deciding whether a compound is pre-
sent. MetAssign works in this situation by producing groups of
peaks that together give more conﬁdence in peak annotations
and putative annotations. In situations where there is genuine
ambiguity about the annotation of a peak, the probabilities
returned will give a measure that can be used directly by the
analyst. For example, the user might decide to report only
compound matches with probability >80%, or to focus special
attention in follow-up experiments on peak groups where two
alternative metabolites (formulas) have probabilities close
to 50%.

3 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

To examine the behaviour of the annotation algorithm, various experi-
ments were run and the output used to produce summary measures of
performance. These experiments included tests of the internal properties
of the algorithm (such as robustness and convergence, shown in
the Supplementary document) and comparisons of the algorithm
against other annotation software packages. The tests were run under
different experimental conditions and examined various output properties
to produce a robust estimate of how the algorithm would perform in real-
life scenarios. The performance of the algorithm was also tested
against the performance of two widely used similar metabolite annotation
systems, szatch and CAMERA (Kuhl et al., 2012; Scheltema et al.,
2011).

3.1 Comparative evaluation

For the comparative tests, three different standard mixtures of chemical
compounds were run as described in the Supplementary Material.
Various properties of the output were examined and summarized to
produce a quantitative measure of the relative performance of the
three algorithms compared. A good algorithm will have the ability to
correctly annotate most of the peaks or compounds present in a sample.
It will also have the ability to give a low amount of spurious annota-
tions of substances that are not present. There are various statistics that
can be used for the comparison: in this article, the measures used will be
the recall and precision for analyzing peak annotations, and true-posi-
tive rate (TPR, which is the same as recall) and false-positive rate (FPR)
for analyzing formula annotations. An algorithm with a high precision
and high recall (or, alternatively, high TPR and low FPR) is performing
well, though there is normally a trade-off between the two measures.
This trade-off can be formalized by combining the measures in some
way, e.g. by using the F1 score. To calculate these values, four other
quantities are needed: true positive (TP) (annotated and in the sample),
false positive (FP) (annotated and not in the sample), true negative
(TN) (not annotated and not in the sample) and false negative (FN)

(not annotated but in the sample). The performance descriptors can
then be calculated as:

TP TP
Recall or TPR: — Precision: —
TP -l- FN TP -l- FP
FPR: FP F1 : 2 1 Preclslon I Recall
FP -I- TN Prec1s1on -I- Recall

3.1.] Treatment of output The output of the szatch and
CAMERA pipelines consist of possibly multiple compound annotations
for each of the peaks in a spectrum. To provide a range of performance
values over precision and recall, the distribution of support of a peak for
each of the formulas can then be given as 1/|A|, where |A| is the number
of annotations on that peak. In terms of metabolite annotation, the
output of the szatch and CAMERA pipelines does not directly anno-
tate which metabolites are present in a sample. However, given the sup-
port distribution on each peak, simply summing the support distribution
over all peaks will give a support distribution on each compound. Each
compound will then have a vote total between 0 and N. Consequently, a
threshold can be set, such that all metabolites with votes below the thresh-
old are considered ‘not annotated’ and all with votes equal to and above
the threshold are ‘annotated’. A typical value for the threshold would be
1, as this would correspond to at least a single peak uniquely matching a
formula.

Because the annotations on MetAssign are probabilistic, there is a
natural operating range (from 0 to 1) on which the threshold can be
set. This also allows an operating point to be naturally chosen.

3.1.2 Peak annotations Putative annotation of LC7MS data are nor-
mally achieved through the assignment of peaks to one or several com-
pounds. Because, in the analysis described in this article, the compounds
in the samples are known, it is possible to create a measure of whether a
particular peak is explainable by the sample. If a peak matches a known
present compound, this is evidence for a good annotation. If a peak
matches a known absent compound, this is evidence against a good an-
notation. If a peak matches neither a present nor absent compound, this
is evidence of noise. From these ideas, the precision and recall can be
calculated from a set of annotations of peaks as follows.

For each peak n, let p” be the sum of the support for compounds that
are present and let a” be the sum of the support for compounds that are
absent. Discard any values of p” or a” that are 0. There then exists a
distribution of values that show the relative support for each peak from
the annotation database. A threshold can be chosen such that those
values above the threshold are positive and those below it are negative.
From this, [7,, values above the threshold are TP, a” values above the
threshold are FF, [7,, values below the threshold are FN and a” values
below the threshold are TN.

In the case of comparing multiple algorithms, the steps above are fol-
lowed, but instead of discarding all 0 values, only those 0 values for which
[7,, or a” are 0 over all algorithms are discarded. This ensures the number of
items being dealt with (TP -I- FP -I- FN -I- TN) are the same for each
algorithm.

3.2 Testing conditions

To test the performance of each algorithm at different levels of difﬁculty
of the task, a set of compound databases were used. Each database con-
sisted of the compounds that were known to be present in the sample that
was run, plus an extra number of compounds that were not present in the
sample. These decoy compounds were chosen to be similar to the com-
pounds in the sample, by ﬁnding matches to the compound mass in
PubChem within a tolerance of 3ppm. Database sizes of 100, 600 and
1000 compounds were used. The dataset was pre-ﬁltered at a peak inten-
sity level of 5000. MetAssign was set to output annotations at support

sible performance has a precision and recall of 1.0 (top right of ﬁgure).
The lines run over the useful range of the output (0 < threshold 5 1), with
the marks showing thresholds of 1.0, 0.95, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.0. The lines on
the graph show that the behaviour of MetAssign is tuneable to obtain an
intended precision/recall value. The behaviour of szatch and
CAMERA is less tuneable; the default behaviour of these algorithms is
given by the rightmost mark on their lines

levels 1: 1 to 1: 5; the set of possible adducts used is given in the
Supplementary Material.

In addition, the dataset was pre-ﬁltered at peak intensity levels of 0,
5000, 10000, 15000 and 20 000, to vary the amount of chemical noise in
the data; results for these experiments are given in the Supplementary
Material.

For each condition and for each algorithm, the precision and recall for
the peaks and the TPR and FPR for the compounds were calculated. This
was done over a range of thresholds, to produce precisionirecall and
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.

4 RESULTS

To assess the performance of peak annotations, three measures
were used, precision, recall and their harmonic mean, the F1
score. As in all classiﬁcation algorithms, there is a trade-off
between precision and recall, with good procedures trying to
maximize both. With comprehensive results given in the
Supplementary Material, Figure 3 shows an example of this
trade-off. In these figures, ‘Prior’ means the prior probability
of peaks being assigned to metabolites, ‘Posterior’ means the
raw posterior probability and ‘MetAssign’ means the posterior
probability calculated as described in Section 2.3. As can be
seen from these results, MetAssign performs best, with the best
precision while recalling the majority of peaks, the target it was
designed to achieve. In this circumstance, szatch struggles to
recall half the peaks, with a precision of 0.5, while CAMERA is
extremely selective and annotates only a tiny fraction of the input
data, albeit with high precision.

To see the systematic behaviour of the algorithms, Table 1
shows how the F1 score changes as the size of the decoy database
is varied. For the smallest databases, the prior assignment based

For the metabolite annotation task, the results are presented in
terms of the TPR and FPR. An example analysis of this task is
shown in the form of a ROC curve in Figure 4. Although the
MetAssign output dominates the other methods over most parts
of the curve, the operating point will be at a level from 0 to 5%

limited, while still achieving an acceptable amount of recall of the
compounds that are present in the sample. Table 2 shows the
performance at an FPR of 5%; as can be seen, MetAssign con-
sistently performs much better than the other two algorithms at
annotating metabolites, for all standard mixtures tested and at all
sizes of the decoy database.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have presented a statistical method for peak annotation and
metabolite annotation in large untargeted LCeMS datasets. The
novelty in our method lies in the statistical approach to peak
annotation that provides a quantitative assessment of the confi-
dence of annotations, as well as probabilities of metabolite pres-
ence/absence. Validation studies on real-world experimental
datasets showed that MetAssign produced better annotations
of peaks and metabolites than two widely used earlier methods,
while at the same time providing a measure of conﬁdence in its
putative annotations. We believe that these conﬁdence values are
useful in subsequent analysis for, e. g. deciding which metabolites
warrant further investigation by MS” or comparison with an
authentic standard. It may also be possible to use this system
to build a database of metabolites for which putative annotation
is generally possible with high conﬁdence.

As alluded to in the introduction, a further benefit of the
Bayesian approach is that additional non-conventional forms
of information can be easily added to the model. Unlike the
MetAssign approach, which seeks to annotate peaks in the pres-
ence of derivatives, several recent studies have investigated
including metabolic network connectivity into the annotation
stage (e.g. Rogers et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2014; Weber and
Viant, 2010), and it would be possible to include a connectiv-
ity-based prior (such as the one described in Rogers et al., 2009)
in the current model. In addition, it has recently been shown that

in silico retention time prediction can improve annotation, par-
ticularly for isomers (Creek et al., 2011). Such information could
be incorporated through a metabolite-speciﬁc prior retention
time distribution, analogous to the metabolite-speciﬁc prior iso-
tope intensity distribution. Together, these different approaches
provide complementary Views of the dataset that can now be
integrated in a comprehensive, fully probabilistic pipeline for
metabolome data annotation.

Finally, the noise models used throughout MetAssign can
almost certainly be improved Via better models of the detector
itself (Ipsen et al., 2010b) and inclusion in the model of terms
relating to contaminants (Keller et al., 2008). The MetAssign
algorithm thus provides the basis for the modular development
of a general probabilistic framework for the interpretation of
LCeMS data in metabolomics.

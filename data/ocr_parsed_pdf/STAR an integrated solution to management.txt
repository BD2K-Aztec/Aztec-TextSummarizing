ABSTRACT

Motivation: Easily visualization of complex data features is a neces-
sary step to conduct studies on next-generation sequencing (NGS)
data. We developed STAR, an integrated web application that enables
online management, visualization and track-based analysis of NGS
data.

Results: STAR is a multilayer web service system. On the client side,
STAR leverages JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas and asynchronous com-
munications to deliver a smoothly scrolling desktop-like graphical user
interface with a suite of in-browser analysis tools that range from
providing simple track configuration controls to sophisticated feature
detection within datasets. On the server side, STAR supports private
session state retention via an account management system and pro-
vides data management modules that enable collection, visualization
and analysis of third-party sequencing data from the public domain
with over thousands of tracks hosted to date. Overall, STAR repre-
sents a next-generation data exploration solution to match the require-
ments of NGS data, enabling both intuitive visualization and dynamic
analysis of data.

Availability and implementation: STAR browser system is freely
available on the web at http://wanglab.ucsd.edu/star/browser and

1 INTRODUCTION

Using genome-browser software to Visualize sequence data is
often a productive first step to take when tasked with extracting
biological meaning from experimental results. Existing genome-
browsers fall mainly into two categories: stand-alone and
internet-based. Stand-alone programs, such as seqMINER,
CisGenome, MapView, EagleView, NGSView, MagicViewer,
integrative genomics Viewer and GenomeView (Abeel et al.,

Jiang et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2011; Shannon et al., 2006;
Stothard and Wishart, 2005; Ye et al., 2011), are installed locally
and allow users to perform analysis and data Visualization to the
limit of their local machine. Users must ensure software remains
up-to-date and are often required to download and reformat
datasets for use with the application without a clear channel to
share data with others. In contrast, internet-based browsers re-
quire no download, installation or update, typically delegate
computational load to remote servers, and store data centrally
for all users to immediately browse. Some internet-based data
exploration platforms such as Cistrome (Liu et al., 2011) and
Cistrome Finder (Sun et al., 2013) also provide Visualization
function. Other popular web-based browsers, such as
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser
(Kent et al., 2002), UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser (Zhu et al.,
2009) and Ensembl genome browser (Stalker et al., 2004), pro-
vide the beneﬁts of web applications but suffer from continued
reliance on ﬁrst-generation web application technology such as
postback and server-side drawing, making little use of the com-
putational power of clients.

Several publicly released genome browsers, such as the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) epigen-
ome Viewer (Sayers et al., 2011), Generic Genome Browser
(GBrowse2.0) (Stein et al., 2002), Anno-J (Lister et al., 2008),
JBrowse (Skinner et al., 2009) and the WashU epigenome
browser(Zhou, 2011), offer an enhanced user experience through
the use of second-generation (Web 2.0) technologies such as
advanced third-party J avaScript libraries, asynchronous commu-
nications (AJAX), RESTful architecture, and client-side render-
ing. These browsers deliver a more desktop-like user experience
than their ﬁrst-generation counterparts and distribute computa-
tion more evenly between the server and the client, thereby help-
ing to reduce network loading.

Although second-generation browsers have signiﬁcantly
enhanced the user experience, they have room for improvement

on some daily used functions. The NCBI epigenome Viewer
allows smooth panning and zooming but does not support com-
parative analysis between data tracks. GBrowse2.0 and J Browse
do not provide registries of public data tracks for ready-to-use
Visualization and make use of statically generated server-side
images that limit client-side interactivity. The WashU epigenome
browser displays data tracks from the Human Epigenome
Atlas [produced by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Roadmap Epigenomics project (Bernstein et al., 2010) and the
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (ENCODE
Project Consortium, 2007)] along with interactive Visualization
and analysis functions such as correlation and statistics test, but
there is no sequencing data analysis tool like peak calling, and it
is not fully compatible to Microsoft Internet Explorer and
Firefox web browsers. A feature lacking from all second-gener-
ation browsers is the inclusion of sophisticated analysis tools as
an integrated component.

We present STAR, a next-generation web-based application
that aims to provide an integrated solution for both Visualization
and analysis of deep-sequencing data, along with simple access to
public datasets. On the client side, STAR features a next-gener-
ation browser that is based on the Anno-J (Lister et al., 2008)
genome browser, modifying it extensively to add enhanced Visu-
alization options, bug-ﬁxes, improved cross-browser compatibil-
ity, dynamic access to an extensive collection of public datasets
and a suite of in—browser analysis tools (such as correlation ana-
lysis and peak calling). The browser features client-side rendering
Via HTML5 Canvas, smooth navigation Via asynchronous data
transfer, dynamic track state changes (zoom, scale, resize) Via
J avaScript, cross-domain data retrieval and modular track devel-
opment architecture. On the server side, STAR provides distrib-
uted mechanism to collect and process data from public data
sources, user access control to protect private data, data track
management and data conﬁguration management, portable per-
sonal server setup and utilities for storage, parsing and analysis
of sequence data.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The goal of STAR is to provide a scalable system that can pro-
cess, analyze and Visualize private data alongside the large
volume of publicly available data (http://wang1ab.ucsd.edu/star/

Back End

Fig. 1. Architecture and workﬂow of the STAR system

browser). The system can be described as three tiered, with a
middle layer between the front-end and the back-end (Fig. 1
provides an architectural overview of the system).

(1) The back-end (server-side) layer is responsible for mana-
ging data and for providing client-accessible hooks Via web ser-
vices. The STAR server periodically downloads data from public
databases, such as the NIH gene expression omnibus (GEO)
database and the Web sites of the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics
and ENCODE consortium. Automated processing modules then
parse any downloaded data, build index, deposit them into a
distributed database system and create RESTful web services
that provide access Via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP). Where this has been conducted on a remote server,
STAR needs only be informed of the URL of the appropriate
web service and does not need to mirror data.

(2) The middle layer, implemented as a central Web site, pro-
vides a web-based management interface for the system.
Through the web interface, user information, user groups, per-
mission controls, track Visibility, metadata and Visualization op-
tions may be edited by an authorized user. For general use, all
available (Visible) data tracks are searchable, allowing users to
select desired tracks and assemble them into a customized list for
Visualization.

(3) The front-end layer is responsible for data representation
and consists of a DHTML (Dynamic HTML) genome browser,
built using the ExtJS JavaScript library, which runs in a modern
web browser such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet
Explorer. The browser supports extensive client-side View cus-
tomization, thereby reducing computation load on the server.

2.1 The main web interface

The STAR system provides a central web that allows users to
manage and share data from different sources (Fig. 2). In the
top-right frame, users can browse and sort all available data
tracks by organism, cell type, data type (e.g. ChIP-seq, RNA-
seq, Methle-seq), generation institute, upload date, data acces-
sibility (public, group or private), track type (read or intensity
type that does or does not contain read sequences) or type of
histone mark. Full text search using key words is also available
for quick data retrieval.

Any dataset, selected by the user for Visualization, is first
added to a track pool in the bottom-right frame. The track
p001 also includes different gene model tracks, such as human
and mouse species for RefSeq gene information. Those selected
tracks are then assembled into a ‘View configuration’ that is
added to a list of configurations shown in the left frame. Next

the data tracks. The tracks can be re-ordered, activated or deactivated,
e.g. dragging the track names to re-order; (B) additional information
window shows the output of in-browser analysis (e.g. peak found by
peak-calling algorithms and correlation coefﬁcient between two tracks)
or zoom-in details; (C) global settings and functional analysis buttons to
change the global View settings, such as display mode, scaling method,
global scaling factor, dragging mode, zooming level, locations and data
analysis options; (D) Y-labels and track selector; (E) in-track conﬁgur-
ation toolbar to select display mode for Hi-C data; (F) track lane displays
data signal and dialog buttons for color changing, scaling factor and lane-
height resizing

to each configuration in the list is a ‘View’ button that, when
clicked, launches a new browser instance showing only the
tracks selected in the conﬁguration (in the order selected). The
main interface and graphical features of the STAR browser are
shown in Figures 3 and 4 and described in detail in the following
sections.

2.2 Browser features

The browser facilitates simple navigation of data Visualizations.
To change locations, a user may drag the mouse left or right,
triggering asynchronous retrieval and rendering of new data as
required. Alternatively, users can input a chromosome coordin-
ate in the top toolbar or a gene name in the searching box of gene
model track to jump directly to a speciﬁc location. Tracking the
mouse cursor, an information box shows the current genomic
coordinate and the sequencing read count at that position in
the track under the cursor. Users have the option to set a baseline
level of read counts to only Visualize signals stronger than that
baseline, and may change the color of data series as desired using
a color palette.

2.2.] Single base pair and chromosome-wide resolution The
STAR browser supports a wide range of zooming levels from
single base pair to chromosome-wide resolution. At single base
resolution, users can Visualize read sequences from each experi-
ment, compare them with a reference genome sequence shown at
the top of the panel (Fig. 4A) and readily identify single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms and indels. Chromosome-wide resolution
provides a bird’s-eye View of the whole chromosome, facilitating
identiﬁcation and comparison of chromosome-wide patterns
across tracks. The zoom level may be adjusted by clicking on
the zoom-in/out buttons to zoom by a fixed interval, by typing in
a speciﬁc zoom ratio in bases per pixel (such as 10:1 or 1:10) or
by selecting zoom as a drag mode and highlighting a region to
be zoomed in upon.

mode; (D) Hi-C interactions in rectangle mode; (E) correlation coefﬁ-
cients between selected track pairs; (F) set operation (e.g. sum/subtrac
tion/merge of two tracks) results

2.2.2 Flexible data scaling As signal intensity can vary widely
within and between data tracks, it is important to scale data
appropriately. The STAR browser supports three scaling
modes: global-ﬁxed, individual and uniform. In the global-
fixed scaling mode, the signals of all tracks are displayed at the
same scale through the entire genome, in contrast to the other
two modes in which signals are optimized for display in the cur-
rent Visualization window. The global scaling factor can be set
Via a y-axis input box. In the uniform scaling mode, all tracks use
the same scaling factor within the current View window so that
signals in different data tracks can be directly compared. In the
individual scaling mode, individual tracks are automatically
scaled to optimize the Visualization of each individual track in
the current window. In addition, users can manually scale signals
by either specifying the global (for all tracks) or individual (for
individual tracks) scaling factor. Another useful feature is to
customize the baseline for Visualization, which allows removal
of noise.

2.2.3 Flexible display modes There are two display modes in the
browser: histogram and heatmap. Data series are displayed in
histogram mode by default, with the height of each bar repre-
senting sequence read depth at that location. In heatmap mode,
the read count or signal intensity is colored red for high values
through to green for low. Heatmap mode permits a more com-
pact display, allowing on—screen Viewing of more datasets at
once.

2.2.4 Display of chromosomal interaction data The STAR
browser provides a novel function to browse and Visualize 2D
interaction data such as Hi-C data. In this function, a 2D heat
map shows the interaction intensity or correlation between pairs

STAR

 

of genomic loci. As the need for Visualizing the relationship be-
tween different loci is increasing, this unique function makes it
possible to interactively Visualize such 2D datasets and connect
the information with available genomic annotation. There are
two display modes for 2D maps: triangle and rectangle
(Fig. 3C and 3D). The triangle mode shows the interaction in-
tensity of Hi-C at a certain position and the two interacting loci
form a regular triangle (Fig. 3C). In this way, the proximal inter-
actions are displayed in the bottom region and long distance
interactions in the upper region. The rectangle mode shows the
interaction intensity as a matrix (Fig. 3D) in which the proximal
interactions are shown along the diagonal. In both display
modes, users can Visualize the Hi-C data within the same
chromosome or between different chromosomes. Positions of
the interacting loci and the interaction intensity are shown for
the current position of the mouse cursor.

2.2.5 In—browser analysis To allow easy interpretation of data,
several in—browser analysis tools have been implemented. Users
may select tracks for analysis by ticking the checkbox of each
track, and the analysis results are displayed in a new track next to
the selected track for analysis or in a separate information
window. The STAR system currently provides three types of
analysis tools that are widely used for NGS data exploration:
data statistics, set operations and peak calling.

Statistics functions include ‘intensity’ and correlation analysis.
In addition to the function of showing the signal intensity at the
mouse cursor’s location, users can also measure the average
signal intensity for a sample (data track) or for the current
View region using the ‘intensity’ operation on the selected
tracks. Correlation analysis helps user to evaluate how similar
one data track is to other tracks. The first selected one is con-
sidered as the reference, and the Pearson correlations with each
of other tracks can be obtained by clicking the ‘correlation’
button. The results are shown as histograms in the left bottom
information window (Fig. 4E). These ‘statistics functions’ in
STAR are region-based, i.e. the result is calculated for the cur-
rent View range. Such a design provides users the ﬂexibility to
explore regions of interest with a fast speed. Users can also zoom
out to the entire chromosome to perform these calculations if
needed.

Set operations allow comparison of signals between different
data tracks, which include merge, intersect, sum and subtract.
Those operations provide an easy way to show the difference and
common signals between the two selected tracks. For example,
‘merge’ operation takes union of all the signals from two tracks
and displays them in a new track with signals colored differently,
which allows easy Visualization of the common and different
signals. ‘Intersect’ displays regions that have signals from all
the selected tracks, and it helps to identify common signal
peaks/domains and remove some weak signals. ‘Sum’ and ‘sub-
tract’ are also useful when users want to plus or minus reference
signals from a data track.

Another in—browser analysis tool is peak calling that is, to our
knowledge, not available in any other existing general purpose
browser. Peak calling is a computational method widely used to
identify peaky signals such as protein binding sites or chromatin
modiﬁcation regions. STAR system has wrapped up Model-
based Analysis for ChIP-Seq (MACS) (Zhang et al., 2008) as

the peak calling algorithm in back-end. STAR determines
whether peak calling can be performed on the selected track,
and only enables a check box next to the tracks for which
peaks can be called. The peak calling runs in asynchronous
mode at the back-end and the results are shown as a new track
once available. Users do not have to keep waiting on the page
because the peak calling results are stored in the back-end and
can be Visualized immediately in the user’s next login. It is worth
noting that the STAR system only provides the mechanism to
streamline the whole workﬁow and handle output data. The
analysis results are based on the referenced program itself.
These jobs can be easily submitted to a cluster or grid computing
environment for using distributed computing resource without
too much complexity by modifying job policy.

2.2.6 Data formats and data processing ﬂow Back-end data
processing module processes the data track files, either uploaded
by users or downloaded from the public databases. This module
recognizes multiple input formats, such as Bowtie (Langmead
et al., 2009), Eland and Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM/
BAM) formats (Li et al., 2009), for short reads alignment results.
Other data formats, including Browser Extensible Data (BED)/
bigBed, Wiggle format (WIG)/bigwig, General Feature Format
(GFF) and MapView, which usually can be Visualized by UCSC
genome browser, are also supported. The STAR system auto-
matically determines the input data format and extracts the
required information. Although there are many different types
of data features for Visualization, such as gene model, ChIP-Seq,
RNA-Seq and CpG methylation sites, and the browser renders
them in different presentation features, they all share essentially
the same information such as location, strand, sequence reads
and signal intensity values. They can be extracted and abstracted
into a uniform internal database format, which is crucial for
automating data process (Fig. 5).

2.2.7 View conﬁguration saving Users are often interested in
speciﬁc genomic regions or prefer a specific set of scaling and
zooming levels in their Visualization. The STAR browser allows
users to save their preferences using the ‘save’ button and the
user can share the URL with others to display the saved

configuration. In addition, ‘snapshot’ function allows the user to
save the current View position/conﬁguration that can be loaded
(‘1oad’ button) or removed (‘remove’ button) from the user’s
account.

2.3 Data management system

A major advantage of web-based browser systems compared
with stand-alone browsers is that users can access not only
their own datasets but also public datasets without downloading
an entire set to a local computer. STAR has a scalable and
distributed architecture that meets the requirements of handling
large amounts of data. Although data sources may be distributed
across many remote sites, metadata and data access services are
organized and managed by a central web interface. This pro-
motes better sharing of data tracks between users.

2.3.] Data access control Registered users can use the data-
access-control module to customize data tracks and their conﬁg-
urations. In addition to Visualizing the public data stored in the
STAR database, users can also View their own data and select
one of the three permission levels to control access to the data:
private (only accessible to the user), group (accessible to all users
in the deﬁned group) and public (accessible to the public). The
group access permission is especially useful for collaborators
sharing private data. STAR also allows anonymous login as a
guest without a password. Guests gain access to all public data
tracks and the full functionality of the STAR system for the
current session.

2.3.2 Data track management Combined with a valid work-
around to address cross-domain restrictions in web browsers
(such as the use of a properly secured reverse proxy), data may
be pulled from multiple remote sites directly into a Visualization
instance by simply knowing the URL of a data source. This helps
balance data loading between multiple servers and provides a
simple mechanism for publishing locally stored data. When gen-
erating custom data tracks, users can process and store data in a
local computer and simply submit the track meta-information to
the STAR system by providing access permission, species, data
track type and service URL. The STAR system saves this infor-
mation to provide centralized data management and thus func-
tions as a one-stop shop for users.

2.3.3 Data conﬁguration management To View data tracks, users
need to assemble a conﬁguration that contains a list of desired
tracks and display settings. As a user may have thousands of data

Table 1. Summary of data tracks in STAR database system

tracks available to them, it is essential to have an easy way to find
and retrieve the tracks of interest. In the STAR system, users can
perform a full text search using key words. Alternatively, users can
browse all the available data tracks based on information such as
species, cell type or experimental type. Retrieved data tracks can
then be sorted by generation date, experimenter or some other
piece of information. Users can select data tracks to build a new
data conﬁguration or can add the selected data tracks to an exist-
ing conﬁguration. The data conﬁguration can be Viewed using the
default settings for factors including chromosome number, start
position, display resolution, color and scaling factor. Users can
also customize and save Visualization settings.

2.4 Back-end database

The STAR system collects diverse sequencing data that are pub-
licly available and makes them ready-to-View for users. STAR
gathers data ﬁles from different data sources following their data
release policy. A data retrieving program can periodically check
the Web sites of NCBI gene expression omnibus, ENCODE
Consortium and NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping
Consortium and downloads any new or updated sequencing
data files to the STAR data servers. Automated routines then
uncompress the data files and extract needed information, such
as location, sequence and signal intensity values. Extracted data
can then be deposited into multiple data nodes supported by file
system database using a simple internal format (Fig. 5). When a
client requests new data, the server retrieves data from the data-
base or from an existing cache and responds with it to the client.
Currently, there are >7000 data tracks available in the STAR
database that is accessible to the public (Table 1).

To facilitate interpretation of data tracks, the STAR system
also provides access to results from computational analysis.
Currently, epigenetic states annotated by a hidden Markov
model called ChroModule (Won et al., 2013) are available in
eight cell types (Gm12878, H1, Hmec, Hsmm, Huvec, K562,
Nhek, Nhlf). ChroModule calculates the probability of each
100 bp bin assigned to one of the five annotated categories includ-
ing promoter, enhancer, intragenic, repressed and background
based on the histone modiﬁcation data. These probabilities are
available as data intensity tracks in STAR for Visualization.

achieve good user experience, fast data access and quick response
are crucial aspects. Such features are usually limited by network
communications and computational load on servers. For a tradi-
tional web-based genome browser, usually the web server or
application server retrieves data from a database and renders
an HTML page to the client. Almost all the computing load is
on the server side and heavy request trafﬁc places heavy load on
servers. The STAR system distributes computation between the
client and the server(s). Graphical representations of data are
constructed purely on the client side and modiﬁcations to View
state (such as scaling or color) do not require any form of server
interaction thanks to the use of HTML Canvas. (Page refreshes
are completely avoided through the use of AJAX to provide a
smoother browsing experience.) Most modern, W3C-comp1iant
web browsers are in the process of fully adopting the new
HTML5 speciﬁcation, which includes the Canvas element
(although most such as Safari, Chrome, Opera and Firefox
already supported Canvas many years ago). To provide compat-
ibility with older versions of Internet Explorer, Google’s
ExplorerCanvas plug-in provides the required functionality.
When users zoom out to View a larger genomic region, more
data must be retrieved from the data server, which takes more
time and disk space. To deal with this, J Browse provides a solu-
tion similar to Google Maps by pre-generating small images at
different zooming levels. However, because those images are
generated on the server side, it is usually difﬁcult to provide a
ﬂexible way to interact with the data and change View mode
rapidly when compared with the performance of STAR.
Instead of generating static images, STAR pre-calculates the
coverage of positions at each zooming level. The server retrieves
data from a pre—calculated database at each View resolution. This
significantly reduces the data amount retrieved and the time for
data processing. For the purpose of simplicity, STAR uses the
Berkeley DB (BDB) file system, rather than a relational database
such as MySQL to deposit sequencing data. This provides key
features such as optimized indexing and caching to deposit and
retrieve data from ﬁles using several customized language-
speciﬁc APIs. This design has a better performance than most
relational databases, and there is no need to run a large system to
maintain the sequencing data. To reduce searching space, the
input data are deposited into separate ﬁle databases in which
each file contains all the data features for a speciﬁc chromosome.
Combined with pre-calculation, ﬁle system database and cache
technologies, the data preparation is fast and provides almost
constant access time regardless of the zooming level. To reduce
network transit time, all data are compressed (where supported
by the client). Upon receipt and unpacking, data parsing times in
the browser are minimal due to the fact that JavaScript Object
Notation (J SON) format is natively supported by JavaScript.
If custom data ﬁle is too large for network transferring (STAR
limits the maximum upload size up to 2 GB), or unpublished
data need to be kept private, user would probably prefer to
storing data in their own data server and this is supported by
STAR. This function is available in the UCSC genome browser
using indexed data formats, such as BAM and bigwig to contain
data features. Data ﬁles are distributed on web accessible servers
and queried Via HTTP to retrieve the portion that is needed for
the chromosomal position that users are currently Viewing. In
contrast, STAR provides a high efﬁciency C++ program for

data processing and an in-house Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) server program for processing data requests. There are
several advantages of this design. First, users do not need to
install and configure a complicated web server such as Apache.
The STAR system handles data request using a simple program
that is easy to install and launch. Second, STAR uses a simple
data processing program to convert multiple input formats to a
uniform internal format, which is easy for data processing.
Third, it provides a better solution for data service provision,
such as pre-calculation and cache functions to improve system
performance. Once the meta-information for each track is gen-
erated and submitted through the STAR upload page, data are
available for direct Viewing and sharing with other users.

We compared the STAR browser system with several other
web-based genome browsers (Table 2). Relative to other Web
2.0-enabled browsers, STAR provides a large collection of
sequencing data tracks, allowing users to Visualize most public
datasets. In addition to the features that are available in many
recently developed genome browsers, such as rich Visualization
features and high interactivity, STAR has implemented sophisti-
cated in—browser analysis tools such as peak calling that are not
yet available in other browsers. The functionality of in—browser
analysis makes data analysis intuitive and straightforward, which
is particularly useful for users without much data analysis experi-
ence. We are aware that there is still more room to improve the
functionality and usability of the STAR system. In the future, we
plan to further improve the user-friendly interface, add more
graphical features to the browser and include more annotation
tracks to help researchers easily extract biological information
from sequence data.

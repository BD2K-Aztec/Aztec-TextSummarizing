Abstract

Summary: lsoMlF Finder is an online server for the identification of molecular interaction field (MIF)
similarities. User defined binding site MIFs can be compared to datasets of pre—calculated MIFs or
against a user—defined list of PDB entries. The interface can be used for the prediction of function,
identification of potential cross—reactivity or polypharmacological targets and drug repurposing.
Detected similarities can be viewed in a browser or within a PyMOL session.

Availability and Implementation: lsoMlF Finder uses JSMOL (no java plugin required), is cross—

 

browser and freely available at bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca/imfi.

1 Background

Binding site similarities capture local physico—chemical correspond—
ences between two protein structures, in particular cavities, based on
functional pseudocenters (Shulman—Peleg et (11., 2005), all surface
atoms (Najmanovich et (11., 2008), electrostatic surfaces (Kinoshita
et al., 2007) or molecular interaction fields (MIFs) (Chartier and
Najmanovich, 2015) among others. Applications include, the predic—
tion of molecular function, detection of cross—reactivity (Weber et (11.,
2004; Xie et (11., 2009) and polypharmacological targets (Kalliokoski
and Vulpetti, 2011), druggability analyses (Campagna—Slater et (11.,
2011), prediction of fragments or bioisosteric replacements (Tang
and Altman, 2014; Wood et (11., 2012), drug repurposing and classifi—
cation (Allali—Hassani et (11., 2007; Najmanovich et (11., 2007), etc.
We present IsoMIF Finder, a versatile web—server for the detection of
MIF similarities with IsoMIF (Chartier and Najmanovich, 2015).
IsoMIF uses 6 probes (hydrophobic, aromatic, H—bond donor/ac—
ceptor and positivejnegative charge) and a coarse—grained force field
to define MIFs measured in cavities and a graph matching procedure
to detect MIF similarities. Web—servers exist for some other methods
e.g. SuMo (Jambon et al., 2005), pdeun (Ausiello et al., 2005),
eF—seek (Kinoshita et al., 2007), SiteEngine (Shulman—Peleg et (11.,

2005), ProBiS server (Konc and Janeiic, 2014) and IsoCleft Finder
(Kurbatova et (11., 2013).

2 Submitting a job

The query MIFs are calculated in cavities of a PDB structure. The
user first provides a PDB (Berman et al., 2007) structure by entering
a 4 letter—code or uploads its own. The user then chooses to find the
top N largest cavities in the PDB or to find the cavity where a speci—
fied ligand is bound. Cavities are identified with the Get_Cleft algo—
rithm (Gaudreault et (11., 2015), our in—house implementation of
Surfnet (Laskowski, 1995). The user then selects the comparison set,
either one of four pre—calculated MIF datasets or a user defined PDB
structure list. The four datasets are the human purinome with 2643
MIFs calculated around purine containing ligands bound to human
proteins, the scPDB with 8077 MIFs calculated in ligand binding
sites (Desaphy et al., 2015), a non—redundant PDB pisces dataset
(Wang and Dunbrack, 2003) with 14082 entries and a dataset of
412 entries of structures of drugs bound to their primary targets (or
homologue) taken from the PDB website. As mentioned, the user
can alternatively provide a list of PDB structures and for each

specify the top N largest cavities to find or one with a specified
bound ligand. The MIFs of the comparison set will be calculated in
these cavities. Finally, several parameters can be defined and opti—
mal values for each are chosen by default. We refer the readers to
the original IsoMIF publication for an explanation of these param—
eters and other methodological details (Chartier and Najmanovich,
2015) and to the online help guide.

3 Cropping the cavities

The cavities identified can sometimes be very large and include non—
druggable cavities. By cropping the cavities, the user ensures the
query MIFs are calculated in regions of interest. For this, a 3D mol—
ecule viewer for each query cavity (Supplementary Fig. S1) shows
cavity lining residues that can be unchecked, cropping the cavity vol—
ume within 3A radius of their atoms. If the user provided a list of
PDB entries for the comparison set, a table lists the cavities found
with corresponding information like chains in contact, bound mol—
ecules and number of residues in contact (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Each cavity can be visualized within the protein structure (GIF and
PNG) and the user can select only the cavities of interest for the
comparison.

4 Results page

A results table for each query cavity lists the top hits found
(Supplementary Fig. S3) and can be downloaded in CSV format.
The top hits can be sorted by Tanimoto similarity or number of
nodes (similar probes detected). Additional data provided includes
Z—score, the search space (number of grid points sampled), the crys—
talized ligand around which the hit MIF is calculated (for purinome,
scPDB and drug—target datasets only), the PFAM family, Uniprot
and protein name. A snapshot of the detected similarities can be
visualized in the browser with a GIF or PNG image. Downloadable
PyMOL sessions show the query (green) and target hit (cyan) struc—
tures with bound molecules and MIF similarities, all superimposed
using the transformation matrix that optimally minimizes the pair—
wise distance between matched probes. The similar probes are
shown using spheres coloured by interaction type: hydrophobic
(cyan), aromatic (orange), H—bond donor (blue), acceptor (red),
positive (green) and negative (magenta) charge. Bigger spheres repre—
sent probes from the query protein and smaller spheres from the
comparison set protein. Semi—transparent spheres represent the ini—
tial MIFs of each protein. The matched probes and the initial MIFs
for each probe have individual selections in PyMOL making it easy
to analyse the different objects individually (Supplementary Fig. S4).

5 Example application

High level of binding site MIF similarity suggests the cavities might
share similar molecular functions. In other words, a drug bound in a
one could bind the other. Experimental evidence suggests that car—
bonic anhydrases can be cross—reactivity targets of celecoxib, a COX—2
specific inhibitor and that this approved drug could be repurposed to
treat glaucoma (Weber et (11., 2004). When using the celecoxib binding
site of COX—2 (PDB 6COX) as query, carbonic anhydrase XIV (PDB
1RJ6) is found within the top hits of the drug—target dataset (Fig. 1;
created using the PyMOL session of the MIF similarities). Both ligands
have a sulfonamide group surrounded by histidines in both proteins
causing the negative charge similarities (magenta spheres). In 6COX,
HIS90 could interact with the sulfonamide via hydrogen bonding

while in 1RJ6 the interaction would be mediated by a Zn2+ atom
(small grey sphere) coordinated by HIS94 119 and 96. Hydrogen bond
donor and acceptor similarities were also found near the sulfonamide
(not shown for clarity). The hydroxyl of THR199 in 1RJ6 creates a re—
gion favorable for H—bond acceptor probes, similarly to the amine of
GLN192 in 6COX. The same detailed analysis could be done for
other probes. This example highlights how the results of IsoMIF
Finder can be used to analyse binding site similarities, the underlying
structural determinants in a context of drug repurposing and analysis
of cross—reactivity.

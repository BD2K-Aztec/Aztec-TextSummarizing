traditional multivariate approaches when dealing with high—
dimensional random vectors observed on a much smaller
number of sampling units (Shannon et al., 2002). Secondly, dis—
tance measures can be appropriately deﬁned for data generated
under different experimental conditions, and are not conﬁned to
data types represented only by vectors. A number of distance
measures are readily available for several types of biological
data, including DNA sequences (Wu et al., 1997), genetic mar—
kers such as SNPs (Goh et al., 2011), gene expression data
(Priness et al., 2007), longitudinal gene expression data (Minas
et al., 2011) and proteins (Hollich et al., 2005). Moreover, for a
speciﬁc data type, more than one distance measure can be de—
ployed to capture different aspects of the data. This can ultim—
ately lead to the discovery of different types of associations. It
should be noted, however, that in the case of multivariate meas—
urements, interpretation with respect to individual variables is
lost. Because we are interested in the combined behaviour of
all variables comprising such vectorial measurements, we do
not consider this issue further.

Only a handful of statistical procedures are currently available
to determine whether there is an association between paired dis—
tance matrices, and they all rely on computationally intensive
procedures for statistical inference. The most commonly used
and well—known procedure is the Mantel test (Mantel, 1967), a
generalization of Pearson’s correlation. The test has already been
found useful in many applications arising in bioinformatics
(Beckmann et al., 2005; Shannon et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2011).
This testing procedure, however, has some limitations. Firstly,
when used to compare paired scalar—valued observations using
the Euclidean distance, the test exhibits less power than
Pearson’s correlation test (Legendre and Fortin, 2010; Peres—
Neto and Jackson, 2001), i.e. it is a poor test of the null hypoth—
esis of no correlation between scalar—valued variables. Secondly,
computationally intensive Monte Carlo permutations are
required to assess signiﬁcance. This procedure, which assumes
exchangeability of the sampling units under the null hypothesis
of no association, introduces sampling errors that leads to in—
accurate estimation of small P—values. This is especially true
when too few permutations are used, generally between 0(103)
and 0(105) (Berry and Mielke, 1983; Knijnenburg et al., 2009;
Mielke and Berry, 2007). For example, to obtain a permutation
P—value within 10’5 of a true P—value of 0.001, it has been shown
that 0(107) permutations are required, which is computationally
infeasible without access to specialized high—performance
computational resources. This is the case in all situations where
thousands or even millions of tests are required, such as in eQTL
mapping studies in which the entire genome is scanned in search
of potential associations. In such large—scale applications, it is not
uncommon to settle for a much smaller number of Monte Carlo
permutations per test, which in turn can lead to inﬂated family—
wise type I error rates (Phipson and Smyth, 2010).

In this article we propose a novel test, the generalized RV
(GRV) test, to detect association between paired distance matri—
ces. This test is derived as a generalization of the classical multi—
variate RV test of no correlation between paired random vectors,
originally proposed by Escouﬁer (1973). While inference can be
performed via computationally intensive Monte Carlo permuta—
tions, we also derive an approximation to the exact null distri—
bution which would be obtained by enumerating all

permutations. Using the proposed null distribution, approximate
P—values can be estimated in closed—form without the need for
computationally intensive procedures. The proposed GRV test is
introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe power studies
showing that the GRV test can offer greater statistical power
than that achieved by the Mantel test even when many millions
of Monte Carlo permutations are performed. Section 4 presents
an application of the GRV test in cancer research, where the
interest lies in detecting biological pathways characterized by a
non—random association between genetic and gene expression
sample variability. Concluding remarks are presented in
Section 5.

2 THE GRV TEST

2.1 Problem statement

Assume we have observed paired measurements {(x,~, y,~)}f:l on N
independent biological sampling units. Each one of the {xi}f:l
and {y,~}f:l measurement sets is represented by a particular data
structure, such as continuous or discrete vectors, although these
structures do not necessarily need to be vectorial. For instance,
the measurements might be structured as graphs or trees
(e.g. representing biological networks or ontologies). We also
suppose that suitably chosen semi—metric or metric distances (1x
and dy have been identified that capture the dissimilarity be—
tween any sample pair {(x,~,x,«)},~# and {(y,, y/)},~#, respectively.
On evaluating the distances for all possible pairs, we obtain
the paired N x N distance matrices Ax = {dx(.xi,.r/)}x:l and
Av = {d\rv<y.~,y.z>}i7,«:l- ‘

Using the random sample, evidence of non—random associ—
ation between these paired genomic measurements can be as—
sessed by testing the null hypothesis that Ax 7E aAy, for some
positive constant a. This constant represents possible scaling dif—
ferences between the elements of each distance matrix, which
may arise because of the chosen distance measures. Under this
null hypothesis, the relationship between the elements in Ax is
not maintained by the corresponding elements in  The alter—
native hypothesis is that the distance matrices are equal up to a
constant, in which case every distance dx(x,~, x) is linearly related
to the paired distance d‘,,(y,~, y). We are particularly concerned
with settings where inferences must be drawn for a large number
of such tests simultaneously, and hence the computational cost in
obtaining a P—value for each test should be kept as low as
possible.

2.2 The proposed test statistic

When the observations are vectorial, the mean—centred vectors
{x,~}f:l e IRP and {y,~}f:l e IRQ can be arranged in paired data
matrices, X and Y, of dimensions N x P and N x Q, respectively.
In this case, to establish whether the P and Q variables are
correlated, the null hypothesis that 2“, = 0 is commonly
tested, where 2”, is the P x Q covariance matrix containing
the true covariances between the P variables observed in {x3511
and Q variables observed in {y,~}f:l. The RV statistic has been
proposed for this task and arises as a generalization of Pearson’s
correlation (Escouﬁer, 1973). As with Pearson’s correlation, RV
is computed as the ratio of covariance to the square—rooted prod—
uct of the variances,

A distance-based test

 

_ tr(XTYYTX)
IIXTXII II YTYII’

where tr(-) is the trace function and “A || 2 x/tr(A TA) denotes the
Frobenius norm for matrix A. The RV statistic ranges between 0
and 1, with no association when XTY= 0, and perfect associ—
ation when there exists a linear mapping that relates every
P—dimensional observation in X to every Q—dimensional obser—
vation in Y. Thus, larger values provide evidence against the null
hypothesis. When P = Q = 1, RV(X, Y) = cor2(X, Y), where cor
(-, -) denotes Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient.

We ﬁrst observe that the RV test can be interpreted in terms of
the Euclidean distance matrices Ax and A}, arising by applying
the Euclidean distance measure to {x,~}f:l and {y,~}f:l, respect—
ively. This is because, due to properties of the trace operator,
tr(XTYYT/W = tr(XXTYY), ||XTX|| = ||XXT|| and H YTY|| =
||YYT||, so that RV statistic (1) can be written in equivalent
form as

RV(X, Y) (1)

tr(XXT YYT)

RV X, =—.
( Y) IIXXTIIIIYYTII

(2)
Note that (1) differs from (2) in that emphasis is placed on the
two symmetric N x N matrices XXT and YYT, instead of the
four covariance matrices XTY e IRPXQ, YTX e IRQXP,
XTXE IRPXP and YTYE IRQXQ. In settings where P, Q>N,
which are common when comparing biological measurements,
it is computationally convenient to use (2) over (1).

In addition, the N x N matrices XXT and YYT can each be
written in terms of the Euclidean distance matrices Ax and AV,
respectively. This is due to the results that

1 1
XXT = —§CA§C and YYT = —§CA§C, (3)

where C = (I N — J N/ N) is the symmetric N x N centring matrix
where IN is the identity matrix of size N and IN is the square
matrix of ones of size N (Borg and Groenen, 2005; Gower, 1966).
Also, —%CA§C = Gx, where Gx is the square, symmetric and
real—valued Gower’s centred inner product matrix with (i, j m
element given by

1 1 2 1 N 2
gym, x» = — 5 (New, x1) — N; d..(x,~, x1)

—iid2,(x, x4) + iiiaﬂrx, xk)

Nl=l A "I N21=1k=1 A i i

and similarly for G‘,,, so that tr(XXT YYT) = tr(GxGy),
||XXT|| = “G.” and ||YYT|| 2 “CV”. Thus RV is completely spe—
ciﬁed by the elements of the Euclidean distance matrices.

Based on these observations, we propose a generalization for
the RV statistic that is entirely speciﬁed by any pair of distance
matrices to test the null hypothesis that Ax 7E aAy. These can be
obtained by applying suitable distance measures (1x and (I), to
paired observations {(x,~, y,~)}f:l of any type, i.e. not necessarily
the Euclidean distance to vectors. The resulting Gx and  matri—
ces can then be used in the GRV test statistic

noting the implicit assumption ||Gx|| |  | >0, which is always
satisﬁed in practice; ||Gx|| >0 because Gx contains real—valued
elements that are not all zero, and similarly for 

It is insightful to understand in which ways the proposed GRV
statistic is similar to, and differs from, the classical Mantel stat—
istic. The Mantel statistic is computed as the correlation between
the upper—triangular distances of each distance matrix. Denote
by vx the column vector containing the A = N(N — 1) /2 upper—
triangular distances {dx(x,~, xj)},~>j, and similarly for v‘,. The

Mantel statistic is then computed as rM(Ax, AV) 2 cor(vx, vy), i.e.

Where SC :21}; dxocia  5.2x : 21>; (“1Xth  _  _ 1),
and similarly for )7 and  The statistic therefore standardizes the
upper—triangular elements of each distance matrix to have zero
mean and unit variance. In this way, the distances between
paired distance matrices can be directly compared.

It can be shown that, like Mantel, GRV is also a correlation
coefﬁcient. In particular, it can be proved that GRV is equal to
the correlation between the vectorized matrices Gx/lllel and
GV/ lle H, i.e. the NZ—dimensional vectors gx and g‘, with elements
{gx(xia  and {8101, respeCtively- That
is, GRV(GX, G‘,,) = cor(gx, gy) (see the Supplementary Material).
While both Mantel and GRV are correlation coefﬁcients, the
difference between them lies in the methods of standardization
applied to the distances in each case. In Mantel, the upper—
triangular distances are subjected to a classical standardization,
where their mean is subtracted and they are divided by their
standard deviation. In GRV, however, all distance elements are
considered, and they are squared, double—centred and normalized
by dividing by their Frobenius norm. This difference leads to
greater power of the GRV test to detect association between
paired distance matrices than the Mantel test, as demonstrated
in Section 3. Further properties of the GRV test statistic are
provided in the Supplementary Material. This includes the im—
portant property that it overcomes the limitation of Mantel for
scalar—valued observations and Euclidean distances. Due to the
equality between the RV and GRV statistics when the data are
vector—valued and the Euclidean distance measure is applied
[from (2) and (3)], if centered data matrices X and Y are orthog—
onal, then the GRV statistic equals 0. Thus the GRV statistic can
be used to test a null hypothesis of no correlation between
vector—valued variables, and hence scalar—valued variables,
unlike the Mantel statistic.

 

2.3 Approximate null distribution

Under the null hypothesis, the sampling distribution of GRV is
generally unknown. This is because the quantity T = tr(GxGy) in
the numerator is completely speciﬁed by the elements of Ax and
AV, which have unknown distributions and are correlated. The
null sampling distribution can be generated by using permuta—
tions of one of the centered inner product matrices, Gy, say. For
each of N, permutations n 6 1'1, which are one—to—one mappings
of the set {1, ...,N} to itself, the rows and columns of  are
simultaneoley permuted by n and denoted Gym. This generates
the set {GRV(Gx, 71)},161-1 and the P—value of an observed

 

2557

ﬁm'spzumofpmﬂo'sopeuuopnorq/ﬁdnq

C.Minas et al.

 

GRV statistic, GRV(GX, G‘,,), can be obtained as the proportion
0L permuted statistic values greater than or equal to
GRV(G\.,Gy). This is a right—tailed test, as larger GRV values
provide evidence against the null.

To estimate the P—value without permutations, we adopt a
moment matching approach where the exact null distribution
that would be obtained if all N! permutations were used is
approximated by a continuous distribution. In particular, we
approximate the null distribution by the Pearson type III distri—
bution, which has been shown to capture skewed characteristics
of null sampling distributions (Josse et al., 2008; Mielke and
Berry, 2007). To use this distribution, we require the ﬁrst few
moments of the exact permutation distribution of T; the mean is
[L = ﬁzﬂen Tn, the variance is 02 = ﬁzﬂen  — [12 and the
skewness is

ﬁZ fi—3IMZ—M3

y:

a3 ’
where T ,1 = tr(GxGy‘ 71) and 1'1 contains all N! permutations. No
permutations are needed to compute {12,17, y}, as closed—form
expressions of these quantities are retrievable via the analytical
results of Kazi—Aoual et a]. (1995). These results require that Gx
and  are square, symmetric and centered; properties satisﬁed
by deﬁnition.

On obtaining closed—form expressions for the mean, variance
and skewness of the exact permutation distribution of T, we
standardize T by subtracting [L and dividing by a. The resulting
T Y = (T — u)/a is then assumed to have the Pearson type III
distribution under the null with probability density function
(PDF) denoted fo(t; y); see Mielke and Berry (2007) for the
full definition of the distribution. We denote the CDF of T V by
fTXU; y). The approximate null distribution of GRV
(Gx, G.) = T/||Gx||||Gy|| can then be derived by a simple trans—
formation of the distribution of T V. The CDF of GRV,
fGRVOc; y), is given by

and this is a valid CDF because fo(; y) i/s\a valid CDF. The
P—value of an observed /G\RV statistic GRV(Gx,Gy) is then
estimated by 1 — fGRV(GRV(Gx,Gy); y). The PDF fGRV(x,y)

3 POWER STUDIES

In this section we assess the power of the proposed GRV test and
compare it with the classical Mantel test. A Monte Carlo pro—
cedure is used to estimate the power of the GRV test, and to
estimate the power of the Mantel test we use the recently pro—
posed algorithm of Gandy and Rubin—Delanchy (2013). This al—
gorithm estimates the power of a Monte Carlo testing procedure
and states a confidence interval around this estimate, boasting a
guaranteed coverage probability. It also states the average

number of Monte Carlo permutations required to achieve the
given power estimate. It requires speciﬁcation of the maximum
length of the resulting conﬁdence interval and the desired cover—
age probability, and then runs as many permutations as required
to yield a power estimate with a confidence interval of length no
greater than speciﬁed. Using this approach, we are able to dem—
onstrate that, at least for the experimental set—ups considered,
many millions of permutations are needed for the Mantel test
to achieve power of the same precision as the GRV test, and that
the GRV test achieves greater power.

We use simulated data that mimics the experimental data of a
typical eQTL application where transcriptional measurements
are paired with SNPs. We ﬁrst generate an N x P matrix X
containing N simulated SNPs (i.e. minor allele counts), denoted
x,~ = (.m, ...,.>c,~p)T for i: 1, ...,N, with varying minor allele
frequencies at each of the P SNPs. The minor allele frequency
of SNP p, mp, is ﬁrst simulated from a uniform distribution
U(0.1, 0.5), and the allele count is then simulated from a multi—
nomial distribution with probabilities (1 — mp)2, 2mp(1—mp)
and mi, of observing 0, 1 and 2 minor alleles, respectively. The
paired data matrix Y: 021, ...,yN)T is then generated as fol—
lows. The N x 1 vector z = XIP = (21, ...,ZN)T containing the
row sums of X, i.e. the minor allele counts across the P SNPs, is
computed, and y, = 2,19 +e,~ for i: 1, ...,N, where
e,~ ~ NQ(,1,2), with ,1: (111, ...,MQV and ,1, ~ U(0, 1) for
q = 1, ...,Q, and )2 a random Q X Q Wishart matrix. We
then consider the widely used identity—by—state (IBS) distance
for the simulated genetic markers in X, which measures the
degree to which alleles are shared across the SNPs [see, for in—
stance, Goh et a]. (2011)], in addition to the Sokal and Sneath
(SS), and Rogers and Tanimoto I (RTI) distances (Selinski and
Ickstadt, 2005). For the observations in Y we use the Euclidean,
Manhattan and Mahalanobis distances. See the Supplementary
Material for details on these distances.

For P=2, Q: 10 and each of N: {30, 50, 70, 90, 100}, the
power of the GRV test is computed using 50 Monte Carlo
runs, and each time generating 50 paired datasets as above.
For each genetic and gene expression distance, the GRV test is
applied and the proportion of P—values less than or equal to the
significance level of 0.1% is recorded. The mean power across all
50 Monte Carlo runs for each distance combination and value of
N is reported in Table 1, in addition to the standard deviation of
these estimates. As expected, the power increases with N.

We then estimate the power of the Mantel test for each of the
above settings using the algorithm of Gandy and Rubin—
Delanchy (2013). For each setting, we bound the conﬁdence
interval length by twice the standard deviation of the correspond—
ing estimate for the GRV test. That is, we consider one standard
deviation on either side of the power estimate as an empirical
indication of the precision achieved by the GRV test. We moni—
tor the number of Monte Carlo permutations required to obtain
power estimates with such conﬁdence intervals with a coverage
probability of 95%. These results are also given in Table 1, where
the power is stated alongside the confidence interval, and the
number of Monte Carlo permutations required is stated on a
separate line below the conﬁdence interval.

In all settings, the GRV test achieves greater power than the
Mantel test, even when using large numbers of Monte Carlo
permutations. Note that while the Mantel power estimates

sought and the region of the conﬁdence interval in [0,1]

example of how the standardization used by GRV yields greater
power than that used by Mantel is presented in the
Supplementary Material, in addition to simulation results
demonstrating that the GRV test attains the nominal signiﬁcance
level of a given test.

4 APPLICATION TO OVARIAN CANCER

Around 225 000 women were estimated to have developed ovar—
ian cancer in 2008, of which over 80% are epithelial ovarian
cancer (EOC). In the UK, EOC has particularly poor prognosis,
with only 34% of patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis.

In many cancers, the ability to measure some biomarker that
can predict the likely response to a chemotherapeutic agent could

prevent patients unnecessarily suffering side effects from ineffect—
ive treatments, and may suggest the best course of action where
multiple treatments are available. Unfortunately, while high—
throughput gene expression profiling has been successful in iden—
tifying prognostic ‘signatures’ for many cancers (van’t Veer and
Bernards, 2008), solid tumour gene expression proﬁles have prac—
tical drawbacks preventing their use as prognostic or predictive
biomarkers in the clinic, especially in terms of obtaining mRNA
from the tumour and the transitive nature of gene expression
(Sawyers, 2008). However, circulating tumour DNA can be iso—
lated from serum samples in ovarian cancer patients (Hickey,
1999), which reﬂect an attractive source for genetic biomarkers
both because of the relative ease of accessibility of the patient
material and the long—term stability of the genetic sequence.
Additionally, treating biological pathways as multidimensional
biomarkers may provide substantial improvements in terms of
robustness over single agents (Dai et al., 2011).

We sought to discover if it might be possible to use genetic
biomarkers as surrogates for the transcriptional activation of

starting points for the development of clinical diagnostic tests to
predict the outcome of a therapeutic exploiting a related
pathway.

To identify pathways for which the proﬁle of SNP genotypes
across genes in the pathway closely reﬂects the state of expression
of the genes in the pathway, we applied the GRV test to evaluate
the signiﬁcance of the degree of similarity in distance matrices
derived from SNP genotypes and gene expression levels from a
large set of selected pathways, for two independent cohorts.

4.1 Datasets

For this study, we use two independent cohorts of ovarian cancer
patients: one collected by the TCGA consortium, and an inde—
pendent cohort for validation. For the TCGA cohort, raw data
CEL ﬁles from Affymetrix SNP 6.0 and from Affymetrix HT—
HGU133A microarray proﬁling 494 primary high grade serous
ovarian tumours were obtained from the TCGA web repository.
For the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays, normalization and genotype
calling were performed using the CRLMM method (Carvalho
et al., 2007). Current annotations were obtained from
Affymetrix’s NetAffx Analysis Center and SNPs were annotated
with their associated Gene Symbols. Once SNP probes were
mapped to Gene Symbols, lists of SNPs corresponding to each
ConsensusPathDB (CPDB) (Kamburov et al., 2011) pathway
were obtained by selecting all SNP probes mapping to Gene
Symbols that were included in the pathway’s list of hgnc_sym—
bol_ids as downloaded from CPDB. For the Affymetrix HT—
HGU133A arrays, data normalization was performed using the
RMA method (Irizarry et al., 2003). Probe—set mapping to Gene
Symbols was performed using the hthgu133a.db package from
Bioconductor. Once probe—sets were mapped to Gene Symbols,
lists of probe—sets corresponding to each CPDB pathway were
obtained by selecting all probe—sets mapping to Gene Symbols
that were included in the pathway’s list of hgnc_symbo l_ids
as downloaded from CPDB. The tables of genotype calls and
normalized gene expression values, mapped to pathways that
were used in this analysis, are provided in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, respectively.

As an independent validation dataset, raw data CEL ﬁles from
both Affymetrix SNP 6.0 and Affymetrix HGU133plus2 micro—
arrays profiling 60 primary high—grade serous ovarian tumours
were obtained from the Hammersmith Biobank Resource
Centre. The datasets were provided courtesy of the Genome
Institute of Singapore. Raw data for this independent tumour
cohort was processed identically to those obtained from TCGA,
although mapping of gene expression probe—sets to Gene
Symbols was performed using the hgu133plus2.db package
from Bioconductor. The tables of genotype calls and normalized
gene expression values, mapped to pathways that were used in
this analysis, are provided in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4,
respectively.

We wanted to reduce the possibility that any identiﬁed asso—
ciations simply reﬁected genome—wide similarity structures be—
tween the patients (e.g. due to molecular subtypes of disease)
or involved so few measurements that they were not indicative
of the entire pathway. From the full list of 4119 CPDB pathways
we filtered out all those with less than 5 or more than 200 probe
sets in either gene expression or SNP genotype array datasets.

A total of 479 pathways remained after this ﬁltering, and these
pathways are listed in Supplementary Table S5.

4.2 Experimental results

Because different distance measures highlight different relation—
ships among genetic markers and features of gene expression
data (Priness et al., 2007; Song et al., 2012), we sought to perform
a meta—analysis to combine the results of similarity testing across
a range of distance measures for both the genotypes and gene
expression values. The rationale being that if a given pathway
shows similar distance matrices at the genotype and gene expres—
sion level for a number of different distance measures, the
observed similarity is unlikely to be due to a quirk of one par—
ticular distance measure. For each of the 479 pathways, sample—
wise distance matrices were calculated using eight different
distance measures (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, Manhattan,
Maximum, Bray—Curtis, Pearson’s correlation, Spearman’s cor—
relation and Cosine angle distances) for the gene expression data
and five distance measures (IBS, SS, RTI, Simple Matching and
Hamman I) for the SNP genotypes; see the Supplementary
Material for details on these distances. The association between
the paired distance matrices, one derived from the genotypes of
SNPs mapping to genes in the pathway and the other derived
from the expression levels of genes in the pathway, was evaluated
using the GRV test. This resulted in 40 individual P—values for
each pathway, one for each combination of distance measures
used. An illustration of how the null distribution compares with
the permutation distribution when applied to this cancer data is
presented in the Supplementary Material. Meta—analysis was per—
formed to yield a combined signiﬁcance estimate for each path—
way as follows. On denoting the P—values of the i‘h pathway by
{pi/EL, the Fisher summary statistic —2 2:21 log(p]~,«) was calcu—
lated for each pathway. The corresponding P—value was esti—
mated using 10000 permutations of the individual P—values
across all pathways. All P—values were subjected to the
BenjaminieHochberg false discovery rate adjustment and used
to rank pathways by signiﬁcance of association. The meta—
analysis was repeated for the validation cohort. Ranks for the
TCGA and validation cohorts are given in Supplementary
Tables S6 and S7, respectively.

To obtain a perspective of the robustness/repeatability of the
associations detected between genotype and gene expression at
the pathway level across the two independent cohorts, we com—
pared the degree of agreement between the ranked lists of path—
ways arising from the meta—analysis using the normalized
Canberra distance (Jurman et al., 2008). The general principle
is to quantify the distance between the rankings of the top k
terms of two ranked lists, with each term’s inﬂuence on the over—
all distance weighted by its position in its respective list. By
evaluating the normalized Canberra distance for the top—
ranked k pathways, the relationship between overlap and rank—
ing can be explored: smaller values indicate a lesser discrepancy
in rankings and therefore more similar rankings. Figure 1 shows
the normalized Canberra distance plotted against k. It can be
seen that the overlap of the meta—analysis results from the two
cohorts is greatest for small k, implying that the highest—ranking
pathways in each list are more similar than the lower—ranking
pathways. Furthermore, for each k we used 5000 permutations of

between the ranked lists of pathways from the two independent
cohorts revealed a highly significant agreement in the two rank—
ings, indicating a degree of robustness in the results of our
analysis.

This application of the GRV test has demonstrated that the
transcriptional activity of a number of pathways seem to be re—
liably predicted by sequencing a limited set of genetic markers
that could be detected in circulating tumour DNA obtained from
patients’ serum. This relationship was particularly pronounced
for the pathway ‘5—aminoimidazole ribonucleotide biosynthesis’,
for which the genotypes and the gene expression patterns were
strikingly associated in two independent cohorts of patients. The
association between genotypes and pathway—level gene expres—
sion profile is of particular interest in the case of the platinum
response pathway, which is clearly clinically important in EOC
given that the only standard treatment involves platinum—based
chemotherapy. Following further investigation, these observa—
tions could potentially lead to development of non—invasive bio—
markers that could predict patient response to front—line
chemotherapy, and serve to stratify patients for selection into
clinical trials involving alternative treatments.

As individual distance measures can yield different results in
the analysis of associations across gene expression patterns,
unless a single distance measure is selected a priori as the most
appropriate for each dataset, combining results of multiple tests
of association using different distance measures may provide
more reliable results than a single test. A key advantage of the
GRV test in our application to multivariate eQTL mapping of
pathways in ovarian cancer is that it enables a meta—analysis of
the associations between genetic distance and gene expression
distance for different combinations of distance measures.
Having a test for these associations that does not require expen—
sive permutations enables a fast estimation of the robustness of
the genotype—expression pathway level associations against
quirks of particular deﬁnitions of distance. Given the robust
associations discovered in this analysis, we suggest that it may
be possible to predict the mode of activation of a pathway
(in terms of which members are transcriptionally activated) in
cancer patients, based on the genotype of the tumours’ DNA
across a limited panel of SNPs.

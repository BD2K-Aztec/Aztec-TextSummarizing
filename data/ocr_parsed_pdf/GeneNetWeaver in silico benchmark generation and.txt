ABSTRACT

Motivation: Over the last decade, numerous methods have been
developed for inference of regulatory networks from gene expression
data. However, accurate and systematic evaluation of these methods
is hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate benchmarks
and the lack of tools for a differentiated analysis of network
predictions on such benchmarks.

Results: Here, we describe a novel and comprehensive method for
in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network
inference methods available to the community as an open-source
software called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). In addition to the generation
of detailed dynamical models of gene regulatory networks to be used
as benchmarks, GNW provides a network motif analysis that reveals
systematic prediction errors, thereby indicating potential ways of
improving inference methods. The accuracy of network inference
methods is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision-recall
and receiver operating characteristic curves. We show how GNW
can be used to assess the performance and identify the strengths
and weaknesses of six inference methods. Furthermore, we used
GNW to provide the international Dialogue for Reverse Engineering
Assessments and Methods (DREAM) competition with three network
inference challenges (DREAMS, DREAM4 and DREAM5).
Availability: GNW is available at http://gnw.sourceforge.net along
with its Java source code, user manual and supporting data.

1 INTRODUCTION

A Challenging issue in systems biology is the development of
computational tools for the reverse engineering of gene regulatory
networks from quantitative experimental data. Over the last decade,
high-throughput assays for mRNA expression have opened the door
to the inference of regulatory networks by allowing simultaneous
measurements of the expression levels of thousands of genes.
Technologies such as spotted microarrays (Davis et (11., 1995)
and oligonucleotide Chips (Lockhart et (11., 1996) have enabled

genome-wide quantiﬁcation of differential gene expression proﬁles
and, more recently, short read sequencing technologies such as
RNA-seq (Mortazavi et (11., 2008) have provided more precise
quantiﬁcation of mRNA levels.

Researchers have proposed a plethora of methods for reverse
engineering the complex network of interactions between the genes
and their RNA and protein products (also called regulatory program)
from spatial and temporal high-throughput gene expression data
(Bansal et (11., 2007). Regulatory networks are often represented
as directed, signed graphs in which nodes represent genes or
transcription factors (TFs). In this context, edges correspond to
enhancing or inhibitory regulations that affect gene transcription
rates. Network inference methods rely on various computational
approaches such as correlation (Rice et (11., 2005), mutual
information (MI) (Faith et (11., 2007; Margolin et (11., 2006), ordinary
differential equations (ODE) models (Aijo and Lahdesmaki, 2009;
Bonneau et (11., 2006), Bayesian networks (Yu et (11., 2004) or hybrid
algorithms (Yip et (11., 2010).

Numerous methods have been developed for inference of gene
regulatory networks; however, relatively little effort has been put
into evaluating the performance of those methods on adequate
benchmarks. So far, three main strategies have been proposed to
generate benchmark networks. A ﬁrst strategy consists in evaluating
network predictions made by reverse engineering algorithms on
well-studied in viva pathways from model organisms (Gama-Castro
et (11., 2011; Kim et (11., 2003). However, those networks are
incomplete maps of the physical interactions in the cell that are
responsible for cellular ﬁinctions and using them as benchmarks
imply making error when evaluating network predictions. Another
strategy consists of genetically engineering synthetic in viva
networks (Camacho and Collins, 2009; Cantone et (11., 2009). The
main drawback of this strategy is that only a few small networks
are available. Yet another strategy consists in developing in silica
gene regulatory networks that can be simulated to produce artiﬁcial
gene expression data. The simulation of in silica networks has the
advantages of being fast, easily reproducible and less expensive
than biological experiments. A few instances of small in silica
networks with handcrafted topologies (Kremling et (11., 2004) have
been proposed as benchmarks for reverse engineering algorithms.
More recently, several generators have been developed to automate
the construction of in silica regulatory networks including up to
thousands of genes to be used as benchmark networks for reverse
engineering algorithms (Di Camillo et (11., 2009; Mendes et (11., 2003;
Van den Bulcke et (11., 2006).

Fig. 1. Benchmarking and performance assessment of network inference methods using GNW. (A) In silica gene networks are obtained by extracting
subnetwork structures from known transcriptional networks (Escherichia cali, Saccharamyccs ccrcvisiac, etc.) before being endowed with detailed dynamical
models of gene regulation accounting for both transcription and translation, independent and synergistic interactions, as well as molecular and measurement
noise. (B) In silica gene networks are simulated to produce steady-state and time-series expression data for a variety of experiments such as wild-type,
knockout, knockdown and multifactorial perturbation experiments. (C) Inference methods are asked to predict structures of in silica benchmark networks
from gene expression data. (D) From network prediction ﬁles, GNW performs a network motif analysis which often reveals systematic prediction errors,
thereby indicating potential ways of network reconstruction improvements. It also automatically generates comprehensive reports including standard metrics

such as PR and ROC curves.

Benchmark generators such as AGN (Mendes et (11., 2003) aim
to produce in silica gene networks exhibiting topological properties
observed in biological networks using Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz
(small-world) or Albert-Barabasi (scale-free) random graph models.
However, the structures generated using random graphs capture
only few of the structural properties of gene regulatory networks
(Van den Bulcke et (11., 2006) and do generally not display important
properties such as modularity (Ravasz et (11., 2002) or occurrences
of network motifs, which are statistically overrepresented regulatory
patterns in biological networks (Shen-Orr et (11., 2002). Instead
of constructing more complex random structures based on graph
theory, which may be difﬁcult to justify (Mendes et (11., 2003),
SynTReN (Van den Bulcke et (11., 2006) and ReTRN (Li et (11.,
2009) Chose to generate network structures by extracting parts of
known in viva regulatory network structures. This approach has the
advantage of capturing several structural properties observed in in
viva network structures (Van den Bulcke et (11., 2006).

In order to produce gene expression data, the generated structures
must be endowed with dynamical models of gene regulation.
Systems of non-linear ODEs are widely used (Hache et (11., 2009;
Roy et (11., 2008), but other approaches exist (Di Camillo et (11.,
2009). ODE systems allow to continuously describe levels of gene
products and rates of reactions taking place in the network models
where biological processes that have not been fully Characterized
yet are abstracted. Because current high-throughput technologies do
not allow the monitoring of protein expression as microarrays do for
RNA (Di Camillo et (11., 2009), some benchmark generators consider
mRNA as a proxy for protein expression and thus do not model
translation independently of transcription (Li et (11., 2009; Van den

Bulcke et (11., 2006). Protein expression, however, does not correlate
perfectly with mRNA expression in real biological systems due in
part to different degradation rates of mRNA and protein products
(Belle et (11., 2006). RENCO (Roy et (11., 2008), GeNGe (Hache et (11.,
2009) and GRENDEL (Haynes and Brent, 2009) are examples of
available benchmark generators considering both transcription and
translation processes in their respective dynamical models.

Here, we describe a method for in silica benchmark generation
and performance proﬁling of network inference methods available to
the community as an open-source software called GeneNetWeaver
(GNW) (Fig. l). GNW has an intuitive graphical user interface
that makes the generation and simulation of gene network models
as simple as a few Clicks. Network topologies are generated by
extracting modules from known in viva gene regulatory network
structures such as those of E. cali (Gama-Castro et (11., 2011)
and S.cerevisi(1e (Kim et (11., 2003). These structures are then
endowed with detailed dynamical models of gene regulation
including both transcription and translation processes using a
thermodynamic approach accounting for both independent and
synergistic interactions (Ackers et (11., 1982). Expression data can
be generated either deterministically or stochastically to model
molecular noise in the dynamics of the networks, and experimental
noise can be added using a model of noise observed in microarrays
(Stolovitzky et (11., 2005). Different types of in viva experimental
procedures, such as wild type, knockout (null-mutant), knockdown
(heterozygous) and multifactorial perturbations, can be reproduced
by the software. In addition, a unique feature of GNW is the
systematic and comparative evaluation of predictions by different
inference methods, which none of the existing benchmark generators

provide. GNW performs an exhaustive network motif analysis for a
set of network predictions, which often reveals systematic prediction
errors, thereby indicating potential ways of network reconstruction
improvements. The accuracy of network inference is also assessed
using standard metrics such as precision—recall (PR) and receiver
operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.

Furthermore, we show how GNW can be used to generate in
silica benchmark suites to assess the performance and identify
strengths and weaknesses of six network inference methods. We also
show how the performance of those inference methods are affected
by the structural properties and the size of the gene regulatory
networks to infer, and how GNW can help to identify the most
informative type of gene expression data to provide to a given
inference method. Finally, we assess the performance of those
six inference methods on the network inference Challenge that we
provided to the international DREAM4 competition (Dialogue for
Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods).

2 METHODS
2.1 Topology

Instead of using random graph models, which are known to only partly
capture the structural properties of biological networks (Van den Bulcke
et al., 2006), we generate network structures by extracting modules from
known biological interaction networks such as those of E.cali (Gama-Castro
et al., 2011) and S.cerevisiae (Kim et al., 2003) (the source networks). Our
approach is based on the extraction of modules, that is, groups of genes that
are more highly connected than expected in a random network (Marbach
et al., 2009). We have shown that the topological modules extracted using our
method correlate with functional modules of the source networks (Marbach
et al., 2009). Hence, obtained network structures are meaningful targets for
reverse engineering algorithms because in practice, one typically tries to
infer the structure of a set of functionally related genes.

2.2 Dynamical model

Network topologies are endowed with detailed dynamical models of gene
regulation. Both transcription and translation are modeled using a standard
thermodynamic approach (Ackers et al. , 1982) allowing for both independent
(‘additive’) and synergistic (‘multiplicative’) regulatory interactions. For
each gene i of a network, the rate of change of mRNA concentration F [RNA
and the rate of change of protein concentration F [P m are described by

dx.

ERNAOCJ) = 01—; = mi-ﬁm—AE‘NA-xi (1)
d .

Fl’m‘rxs) =  = ri-xi—Al’m‘yi (2)

Where In, is the maximum transcription rate, r, the translation rate, A§NA
and A?“ are the mRNA and protein degradation rates and x and y are vectors
containing all mRNA and protein concentration levels, respectively. ﬁ(-) is
the activation function of gene i, which computes the relative activation
of the gene, which is between 0 (the gene is shut off) and l (the gene
is maximally activated), given the protein or TF concentrations y. A more
detailed description of the activation function used is given by Marbach et al.
(2010). Note that our approach conserves the nature of the gene interactions
(enhancing or inhibitory) of the imported or extracted network structures.

The integration of the system of equations deﬁned by (l) and (2)
results in noiseless mRNA and protein concentration levels, respectively
x,»(t) and y,»(t) for gene i. In living cells, molecular noise originates
from thermal ﬂuctuations and noisy processes such as transcription and
translation (Becskei and Serrano, 2000). Hence, random ﬂuctuations affect
concentration levels of mRNA and protein, whose expression can be Viewed

as a stochastic process (Gardner and Collins, 2000). Both F [RNA and F [P m
are of the form

dXt—VX DX 3
E- (z)- (z) ()

where V(X,) is the production and D(X,) the degradation term. The
corresponding chemical Langevin equation (CLE) (Gillespie, 2000) we use
to model molecular noise in transcription and translation processes is

dX.
E=V(X.>—D(X.>+c( V(Xt)nv+ DthWd) (4)

where m and rid are independent Gaussian white-noise processes (Gillespie,
2000). c is a multiplicative constant to control the amplitude of the molecular
noise. For each gene i, we use the Stratonovich scheme and the Milstein
method to integrate two equations of the form of (4), one describing the rate
of change of mRNA concentration and one for the rate of change of protein
concentration (Schaffter, 2010).

This model is derived from stochastic kinetics and the underlying
assumptions are discussed by Gillespie (2000). Note that, according to this
model, a gene that is not activated (V(X,) close to zero) has a very low level
of noise (leakage) and it cannot suddenly have a very high transcription rate
due to noise. In contrast, a gene that is activated has a higher level of noise
(which may be interpreted as transcriptional bursts, for instance).

The measurement noise depends on the technology used to monitor gene
expression concentrations (Stolovitzky et al., 2005) and is modeled here
independently of the molecular noise. GNW implements Gaussian and log-
normal models of experimental noise as well as a model of noise observed
in microarrays (Stolovitzky et al., 2005).

2.3 Synthetic expression datasets

The next step in generating in silica benchmark networks consists in
simulating the generated in silica regulatory networks to produce synthetic
gene expression datasets. Available experiments in GNW are as follows:

0 Wild type: the steady-state levels of the wild type (the unperturbed
network).

0 Knockout (null-mutant): steady-state levels of single-gene knockouts
(deletions). An independent knockout is provided for every gene
of the network. A knockout experiment is simulated by setting the
transcription rate of this gene to zero.

0 Knockdowns (heterozygous): steady-state levels of single-gene
knockdowns. A knockdown of every gene of the network is simulated.
Knockdowns are obtained by reducing the transcription rate of the
corresponding gene by half.

0 Dual knockouts: dual knockouts consist of simulating a network with
two genes knocked out simultaneously.

0 Multifactorial: steady-state levels of variations of the network, which
are obtained by applying multifactorial perturbations to the network.
One may think of each experiment as a gene expression proﬁle from a
different patient, for example. We simulate multifactorial perturbations
by slightly increasing or decreasing the basal activation of all genes of
the network simultaneously by different random amounts.

Custom perturbations can also be speciﬁed. Experiments can be simulated
as steady states and/or time-series with user-deﬁned duration and number of
measurement points.

2.4 Evaluation of network inference methods

We not only provide researchers with a method for generating in silica gene
network models to be used as benchmarks for reverse engineering algorithms,
but also tools to facilitate the evaluation of network predictions. From a set
of predictions from one or several inference methods, GNW automatically
generates a comprehensive report including the result of a network motif
analysis, where the performance of inference methods is proﬁled on local
connectivity patterns. The network motif analysis often reveals systematic

improvements (Marbach et al., 2010). Furthermore, PR and ROC curves
are evaluated for each network prediction (Prill et al., 2010). The relation
between ROC and PR curves is discussed by Davis and Goadrich (2006).

3 RESULTS

We assessed the performance of six inference methods to illustrate
benchmarking and performance proﬁling of network inference
methods using GNW (Table 1). We ﬁrst describe how to generate
suitable network benchmark suites for the testing of various
hypotheses. Speciﬁcally, we designed benchmark suites to show
how the performance of inference methods is affected by different
sizes and structural properties of regulatory networks. In addition,
we show how GNW can help to identify the most informative type
of gene expression data that a given inference method could use to
achieve the best possible reconstruction from in vivo experiments.
Finally, we introduce the DREAM4 Network Inference Challenge
we generated, which has been used to assess the performance of
many inference methods (Klarnt et al., 2010; Menendez et al., 2010).

3.1 Generation of network benchmark suites

We generated several network benchmark suites using the approach
described in Section 2. Each benchmark suite is composed of
several in silico regulatory networks (the so-called gold standards
or target networks). Figure 2A shows one gold standard extracted
from a regulatory network of the yeast S.cerevisiae (Kim et al.,
2003). The extracted structures have been endowed with stochastic
dynamical models of gene regulation accounting for molecular noise
in transcription and translation processes.

The dynamical models of gene regulation have then been
simulated to reproduce wild-type, knockout, knockdown and
multifactorial perturbation experiments. Figure 2B illustrates the
evolution of mRNA concentration levels without noise, when
only molecular noise is introduced, and with both molecular and
experimental noise. We generated the following benchmark suites:

° Benchmark suite A: forty 500-gene networks (20 from
E.cali/20 from yeast). Systematic knockout experiments were
simulated to generate steady-state expression data.

0 Benchmark suite B: twenty 100-gene networks (10 from

E. coli/ 10 from yeast), twenty 200-gene networks (10 from
E. coli/ 10 from yeast), and twenty 500-gene networks (10 from

0 Benchmark suite C: twenty 100-gene networks (10
from E.cali/10 from yeast). Systematic knockout and
knockdown, and 100 multifactorial perturbation experiments
were simulated to generate steady-state expression data.

At least half of the genes included in each gold standard are
regulators, i.e. genes which regulate the mRNA production of at
least one other gene. This is to avoid structures where there are
many genes that do not regulate any other genes (out-degree = 0).
We used the default parameter values proposed by GNW to simulate
the gene expression experiments (Supplementary Material).

3.2 Effect of network structural properties on
inference method performance

The performance of network inference methods may strongly vary
depending on the structural properties of the target networks.
Figure 3 shows systematic errors made by each inference method
on four three-node motifs overrepresented in the in viva regulatory
network structures of E.cali and yeast (Marbach et al., 2009), and
therefore in the gold standard structures we generated.

Z-score, Pinna et al., and Yip et al. have different error proﬁles
than CLR, ARACNE2 (both based on mutual information) and
GENIE3, which make systematically false positive errors between
Gene 2 and 3 in predicting fan-out motifs. Note that ARACNE2
seems to make less errors on that particular motif because the gene
interactions present in the gold standards are in general less reliably
identiﬁed than with CLR or GENIE3, independently of any network
motifs considered. On the other hand, Z-score, Pinna et al. and Yip
et al. are strongly affected by cascade motifs, where these methods
systematically predict false positive interactions between Gene 1
and 3.

Fig. 4. Effect of structural properties of target networks on performance of
inference methods. The 20 benchmark networks containing 500 genes each
have been generated for each condition using GNW (benchmark suite A, see
Section 3.1). The inference methods have been applied to predict the directed
structure of each benchmark network from knockout expression data and the
corresponding AUROC and AUPR values have been evaluated. Methods
strongly impeded by the cascade motif (Z-score, Pinna et al. and Yip et a1.)
as shown in Figure 3 exhibit a performance degradation on yeast because
yeast structure is composed of more cascade motifs than E.cali network
structure.

We show that inference methods have changing performance
when used to make predictions about the structure of regulatory
networks having speciﬁc structural properties. Thus, we evaluated
the selected inference methods (Table 1) against the benchmark suite
A described in Section 3.1. Figure 4 shows the AUROC and AUPR
values obtained by those methods when applied to infer E.cali and
yeast network structures from knockout expression data.

The AUROC and AUPR values obtained by Z-score, Pinna et al.
and Yip et al. on yeast gold standards are signiﬁcantly lower than on
E.cali benchmark networks (Mann—Whitney U-test, P < 0.01). The

Fig. 5. Performance assessment of inference methods on GNW-generated in
silica benchmark networks of size 100, 200 and 500 genes. The 20 benchmark
networks have been generated for each condition (benchmark suite B, see
Section 3.1). The inference methods have been applied to predict the directed
structures of benchmark networks from knockout expression data and the
corresponding AUROC and AUPR values have been evaluated. We observed
that the performance of inference methods to reconstruct decreases with the
size of the regulatory networks.

performance degradation observed on yeast is due to the fact that
these methods make systematic errors in predicting cascade motifs,
and because structures extracted from yeast contain more cascade
motifs than in E. coli structures (data not shown). We observe a linear
correlation between the number of cascade motifs to predict in a
regulatory network and the AUROC and AUPR values obtained
for Z-score, Pinna et al., and Yip et al. (Pearson’s correlation,
—0.703 3 rs —0.552, P < 0.05). ARACNE2, CLR and GENIE3 are
less affected by the cascade motif (Fig. 3).

Interestingly, Figure 3 also shows that Z-score and Pinna et al.
exhibit very similar error proﬁles. Z-score is one of the simplest
inference methods (Prill et al., 2010), yet it has relatively high
accuracy in predicting network structures from knockout steady
states. Pinna et al. ﬁrst performs a Z-score analysis followed by a
reﬁnement stage, which aims to suppress the errors made by Z-score
on cascade motifs (Pinna et al., 2010). Figure 3 does not show
any noticeable difference between Z-score and Pinna et al. This is
conﬁrmed by the fact that AUROC and AUPR values for Z-score and
Pinna et al. are not signiﬁcantly different (Mann—Whitney U-test,
P > 0.05).

3.3 Effect of network size on inference method
performance

We are interested in showing how the performances of inference
methods scale with the size of the regulatory networks to reconstruct.
Using GNW, it is very simple to generate in silico benchmark
network of size N <M, where M is the size of the source network
used (e.g. E.cali or yeast). Here, we used the benchmark suite B
described in Section 3.1, where each benchmark network has been
simulated using the above methodology to produce knockout gene
expression data. Figure 5 shows the performance of the inference
methods listed in Table 1 when applied to infer regulatory networks
containing 100, 200 and 500 genes.

CLR has both AUROC and AUPR values signiﬁcantly higher
than those obtained by ARACNE2 for gold standards of size 100,
200 and 500 (Mann—Whitney U-test, P < 0.01). Leaving ARACNE2
aside, AUROC values of the ﬁve remaining methods are comparable.

Fig. 6. Identiﬁcation of the most informative type of gene expression data
required by a given inference method using in silica benchmark networks.
Knockout (k0), knockdown (kd) and multifactorial (mt) perturbations were
applied on 20 gold standards to generate three datasets containing each 100
measured steady states (benchmark suite C , see Section 3.1). Note, Z-score,
Pinna et al. and Yip et al. are not applicable to the multifactorial data.

However, we identiﬁed three methods with relatively high AUPR
values. They are Z-score, and the methods developed by Pinna et al.
and Yip et al. AUROC and AUPR values obtained by Z-score and
Pinna et al. are signiﬁcantly higher than those of Yip et al., and
this is valid for every gold standard size (Mann—Whitney U-test,
P < 0.05). Also, Z-score, Pinna et al. and Yip et al. have high AUPR
variances because they are strongly affected by cascade motifs
(Fig. 3), which are more frequent in gold standards extracted from
yeast than E. coli (each condition in benchmark suite B is composed
of 20 gold standards, half being extracted from E. coli and half from
yeast).

Figure 5 shows that the AUPR values of inference methods
decreases as the sizes of the gold standards increase. The reason
is that the connectivity density of the regulatory networks is higher
for smaller networks. The higher the connectivity density, the easier
it is for each of the six inference methods to have a high AUPR
value (Pearson’s correlation, 0.383 f r f 0.839, P < 0.01).

3.4 Design of in viva gene expression experiments

A given inference method may require a very speciﬁc type of
expression data in order to enable accurate network reconstruction.
We show that in silico benchmark networks have also the ability to
support the design of suitable in viva gene expression experiments,
which are typically time consuming and expensive (Haynes and
Brent, 2009). The benchmark suite C described in Section 3.1 is
formed of 20 in silico networks consisting of 100 genes each, which
we simulated using GNW to produce steady-state data for systematic
knockout and knockdown, as well as 100 multifactorial perturbation
experiments. Figure 6 shows the AUROC and AUPR values obtained
by the inference methods reviewed here (Table 1).

The most accurate network reconstructions are obtained using
GENIE3, Z-score and the methods developed by Pinna et al. and Yip
et al. on knockout data. Knockout experiments are very informative,
because they provide network responses to individual and large
perturbations (genes are ‘deleted’). Knockdown expression data,
where the maximum transcription rate of genes is halved, are
less informative than knockout data and thus lead to less accurate
network reconstructions. Figure 6 shows that ARACNE2 obtained

AUROC and AUPR values comparable to CLR and GENIE3 when
using multifactorial perturbation data. In addition, we considered
providing knockout, knockdown and multifactorial perturbation
data together to ARACNE2, CLR and GENIE3. We observed that
AUROC and AUPR values obtained were slightly higher than
when providing the three expression datasets individually (data
not shown). We also added successively 100, 200, 300 and 400
additional multifactorial perturbations; however, the AUROC and
AUPR values did not improve signiﬁcantly for all methods (Mann—
Whitney U-test, P <0.05). Furthermore, it has been shown using
GNW and time-series data that the inference accuracy of inference
methods reaches a saturation point after a speciﬁc data size (Vijender
et al., 2010). This reveals that simply adding more expression data
does not necessarily imply performance improvement.

3.5 DREAM Network inference challenges

We have used GNW to generate the target networks for three
international competitions on gene network reverse engineering:
DREAM3 (2008), DREAM4 (2009) and DREAM5 (2010).
Participants of the DREAM4 In Silico challenge were asked
to provide network predictions for two subchallenges made of
networks of size 10 and 100, respectively. Each subchallenge was
composed of ﬁve in silico gene networks (two extracted from
E. coli and three from yeast), which have been simulated to produce
steady-state wild-type, knockout, knockdown and multifactorial
perturbation experiments. In addition, time-series data have been
made available.

For each subchallenge, network predictions made by participating
teams have been evaluated by computing P-values, which indicate
the probability that random lists of genetic interaction predictions
would be of the same or better quality (Prill et al., 2010). The
overall score that has been used for ranking of the methods applied
in the DREAM4 In S ilico Challenge was a negative log-transformed
P-value given by

overall score (OS): —0.5 -log10(p1p2) (5)

where [)1 and [)2 are, respectively, the geometric means of AUPR
P-values and AUROC P-values taken over the ﬁve networks. Thus,
larger scores indicate smaller P-values, hence better predictions.
Figure 7 compares the overall scores of the inference methods
reviewed here (Table 1) to those obtained by the participating
methods applied in the DREAM4 In Silico Size 100 Challenge.

The most accurate reconstruction of the ﬁve gene networks of size
100 genes was achieved by Pinna et al. (2010). They participated
to the DREAM4 In Silico Size 100 Challenge, in which their
method was best performer (OS=71.589). Hence, both ﬁrst bars
in Figure 7 correspond to the score of Pinna et al. We have shown
in Figure 3 that AUROC and AUPR values obtained by Pinna et al.
are not signiﬁcantly higher than those obtained using the original
Z-score method. This can be explained by the fact that transitive
causal effects are almost always weaker than the direct effects. We
expect that if many amplifying cascades occur, the reﬁnement stage
introduced by Pinna et al. (2010) will enable more reliable network
predictions as compared to Z-score alone.

It is also interesting to note that the method of Yip et al. has been
the best performer on all DREAM3 In Silico Challenges of size 10,
50 and 100 genes we also provided. Yet, it would have been ranked
7th on the DREAM4 size 100 challenge (OS=57.079). While the

original algorithm is composed of several batches using both steady-
state and time-series data, Yip et al. only used the ﬁrst batch to build
a noise model from knockout steady-state data (Yip et al., 2010). The
achievement of the 7th rank in DREAM4 can be partially explained
by the fact that Yip et al. made a strong and correct assumption on
the Gaussian measurement noise we used in DREAM3, which is no
longer valid in DREAM4. Indeed, we modeled molecular noise in
addition to a model of experimental noise observed in microarrays
(Stolovitzky et al., 2005).

4 DISCUSSION

We propose a comprehensive and powerful framework for in silico
benchmark generation and performance proﬁling of network
inference methods. We implemented this framework as an open-
source tool called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). Biologically plausible
network structures are generated by extracting modules from known
biological interaction networks such as those of E. coli and the yeast
S.cerevisiae. Network structures are then endowed with detailed
dynamical models of gene regulation describing both transcription
and translation processes. Transcriptional regulation is modeled
using a thermodynamic approach accounting for both independent
(‘additive’) and synergistic (‘multiplicative’) interactions. In
addition, our models account for stochastic molecular noise as
well as experimental noise observed in microarrays. The generated
in silico benchmark networks can be simulated in GNW to reproduce
wild-type, knockout (null-mutant), knockdown (heterozygous) and
multifactorial perturbation gene expression experiments. As an
example of the application, we have used GNW to generate
the target networks for three international competitions on gene
network reverse engineering: DREAM3 (2008), DREAM4 (2009)
and DREAM5 (2010). In total, 91 teams have submitted over
900 network predictions on GNW-generated networks, making
GNW one of the most widely used benchmark generators by the
community.

In contrast to the previously proposed benchmark generators,
GNW also integrates tools for systematic evaluation of the
predictions from inference methods on benchmark networks. A
unique feature of GNW is the ability to perform a network motif

analysis from a set of network predictions and their corresponding
benchmark networks. The network motif analysis reveals systematic
prediction errors made by inference method on speciﬁc network
motifs, thereby indicating potential ways of network reconstruction
improvements. The accuracy of network inference is assessed using
standard metrics such as PR and ROC curves.

We have used GNW to generate in silico benchmark suites to
assess the performance and identify the strengths and weaknesses
of six network inference methods. We show that Z-score, and
the inference methods developed by Pinna et al. and Yip et al.
make more accurate network predictions than the two widely used
methods, ARACNE2 and CLR. This good performance is achieved
apparently because those methods target the inference of causal
relationships between genes. However, ARACNE2 and CLR do
not require systematic knockout gene expression data, which are
not always available in practice, to infer undirected networks. Yet
ARACNE2, CLR and GENIE3 methods can be applied to infer
regulatory networks even if no systematic knockout or knockdown
experiments are provided. Furthermore, our results show that at
some point simply giving more expression data to inference methods
does not necessarily imply performance improvement. Therefore,
the integration of additional information about the target regulatory
networks should be considered, for instance using prior knowledge
about the network structures.

The novelty of GNW is that it additionally provides a unique
network motif analysis, which we used to show that the structural
properties of the target regulatory networks affect the performance
of inference methods. We observed that the performances of Z-score,
and the methods developed by Pinna et al. and Yip et al. are impeded
by the presence of cascade motifs in the target networks. Thus, we
show that those methods make signiﬁcantly less accurate network
predictions on the yeast S. cerevisiae, whose structure includes more
cascade motifs than E. coli transcriptional network structure. Finally,
we also provide evidence that in silico benchmark networks can be
used to identify the most informative type of gene expression data
that a given inference method could use to achieve the best possible
reconstruction from in vivo experiments.

ABSTRACT

Summary: To address the impending need for exploring rapidly
increased transcriptomics data generated for non-model organisms,
we developed CBrowse, an AJAX-based web browser for visualizing
and analyzing transcriptome assemblies and contigs. Designed in a
standard three-tier architecture with a data pre-processing pipeline,
CBrowse is essentially a Rich Internet Application that offers many
seamlessly integrated web interfaces and allows users to navigate,
sort, filter, search and visualize data smoothly. The pre-processing
pipeline takes the contig sequence file in FASTA format and its rele-
vant SAM/BAM file as the input; detects putative polymorphisms,
simple sequence repeats and sequencing errors in contigs and gen-
erates image, JSON and database-compatible CSV text files that are
directly utilized by different web interfaces. CBowse is a generic visu-
alization and analysis tool that facilitates close examination of assem-
bly quality, genetic polymorphisms, sequence repeats and/or
sequencing errors in transcriptome sequencing projects.

1 INTRODUCTION

Web-based genome browsers, such as GBrowse (Stein et al.,
2002) and UCSC Genome Browser (Kent et al., 2002), are
widely utilized for Visualizing genomes and their sequence fea-
tures to facilitate various data analyses that address interesting
biological questions. For non-model organisms without
sequenced genomes, transcriptome sequencing is deﬁnitely the
most efﬁcient way to explore the transcribed portions of genomes
and determine their dynamics (Brautigam et al., 2011; Feldmeyer
et al., 2011; Parchman et al., 2010). Many bioinformatics pro-
grams have been developed/improved to address the challenges
in transcriptome assembly, especially de novo assembly without a

reference genome, using complementary DNA (cDNA)/messen—
ger RNA (mRNA) data from next-generation sequencing and
Sanger sequencing (Brautigam et al., 2011; Feldmeyer et al.,
2011; Martin and Wang, 2011; Zheng et al., 2011). So far,
there is no open-source, web-based contig browser yet that
allows users to navigate transcript assembly, Visualize contigs
and examine genetic polymorphisms, simple sequence repeats
and sequencing errors embedded in the assembly. To address
the impending need for exploring rapidly increased transcrip-
tomics data for non-model organisms, we developed CBrowse
(contig browser), an AJAX-based web browser to Visualize and
analyze transcriptome assemblies and their individual contigs.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, CBrowse is designed to
follow a standard three-tier software architecture composed of
Data Layer, Business Logic Layer and Presentation layer, with a
data pre-processing pipeline. The data pre-processing pipeline
detects simple sequence repeats for contigs, makes inferences
from read alignments about putative polymorphisms and
sequencing errors and stores resultant data in a hard-drive ﬁle
system (HDFS), which can be optionally imported into a
SQL—based database (e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL). Data layer
enables data accessing through HDFS or a database, Business
Logic Layer processes users’ requests submitted from
Presentation Layer and Presentation Layer displays the desired
data in different web interfaces.

Since Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format and its sister
format Binary Sequence Alignment/Map (BAM) are widely
adopted in presenting sequence alignment information for both
genome and transcriptome assembly (Barnett et al., 2011; Li
et al., 2009), the input ﬁles for the pre-processing pipeline are
as follows: (i) a SAM/BAM ﬁle that contains alignment infor-
mation for all individual cDNA/mRNA reads mapped to the
contigs, (ii) a sequence file in FASTA format that contains all
contigs within a transcriptome assembly and (iii) a Extensible
Markup Language (XML) conﬁgure ﬁle that provides necessary
information (e.g. species name, assembly name and data loca-
tion) for data processing (Supplementary Fig. S1). Implemented
in C++ with Perl wraps, the pipeline can process input data;
detect polymorphisms, simple sequence repeats and sequencing

errors and generate image, J SON and database-compatible CSV
text files that are utilized by different web viewers of CBrowse
(Fig 1). Our C++ program relies on the application program-
ming interface (API) of BamTools (Barnett et al., 2011) to access
BAM ﬁles, uses tinyXML library (http://www.grinning1izard.
com/tinyxm1/) to generate and parse conﬁguration files and
map index files in XML format and utilizes GD library (http://
www.1ibgd.org) to draw alignment graphics in PNG format. The
pipeline not only extracts overall information for a transcriptome
assembly (e. g. total number of conti gs and associated reads, aver-
age reads per contig and contig length distribution) and calcu-
lates its N50 length but also retrieves summary information for
each contig and computes its sequence coverage. For simple se-
quence repeats, our pipeline invokes Phobos (Mayer et al., 2010)
to identify perfect/imperfect repeats and generates results in GFF
format. The repeat unit size and the minimum repeat number are
customizable using the conﬁguration XML ﬁle. By default, the
repeat unit size is between 1 and 12 nt, while the minimum repeat
number is set to be 8 for mono-nucleotides, 5 for dimers, 4 for
triplets and 3 for repeats with a unit size of 4e12 nt. For putative
polymorphisms and sequencing errors, our C++ program exam-
ines base by base for any discrepancy between each contig and its
component sequence reads. Along a given contig, the C++ pro-
gram identiﬁes all putative polymorphic positions, which must
be covered by 310 individual sequence reads and the accumu-
lated occurrence of any polymorphic type is 35. The valid poly-
morphism types include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs,
single-base mismatch), single base indel and multiple-base mis-
match and indels. The frequency of any valid polymorphism type
needs to be at least 2 for any putative polymorphic position
along a contig. Our pipeline also invokes SAMTools and
BCFTools to call SNPs and short indels and generate results
in VCF format, which can be explored through our
Polymorphism Viewer (see below).

Implemented in PHP and JavaScript (i.e. Dojo and MapEasy
libraries), CBrowse web interfaces are AJAX-based and compat-
ible with Mozilla Firefox (8.0 or above), Google Chrome and
Internet Explorer (9.0 or above). As shown in Figure 1, there are
ﬁve major viewers in CBrowse: (i) Contig Viewer presents sum-
mary information about the assembly as well as individual con-
tigs; (ii) Sequence Viewer allows users to manipulate, examine
and scan individual nucleotides of each contig; (iii)
Polymorphism Viewer provides the polymorphism types
(SNPs, single indels and other multiple-base mismatches/
indels), positions and frequencies for each contig; (iv) SSR
Viewer displays the detected simple sequence repeats in each
contig and (v) Alignment Viewer offers both bird’s eye and nu-
cleotide resolution of sequence alignments in Google-map style,
with color-coded nucleotide differences between contigs and their
component sequence reads. In particular, all these interfaces
allow users to search and navigate data easily.

3 CONCLUﬁON

Similar to GBrowse 2.0 (http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse),
X-MAP W ates et al., 2008), Genome Projector (Arakawa

et al., 2009) and J Browse (Skinner et al., 2009), CBrowse essen-
tially is an AJAX-based Rich Internet Application that de-
couples interactions with users from interactions with the
server. Such decoupling empowers web applications with rich
graphic user interface (GUI) characteristics such as desktop ap-
plication, enables a asynchronous clienteserver communication
and offers faster and smoother user experience by partial updates
in web pages. Different from these genome browsers, CBrowse is
designed for analyzing and visualizing transcriptome assembly
and contigs, with unique functionality such as seamlessly inte-
grated data grid viewer, alignment viewer and sequence viewer
that allow users to navigate, sort, filter, search and visualize
transcriptome data efﬁciently. As an open source project, our
web-based CBrowse can be utilized by the research community
to disseminate and release transcriptome data over the Internet.

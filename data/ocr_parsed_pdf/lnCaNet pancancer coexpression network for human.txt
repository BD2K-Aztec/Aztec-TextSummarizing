Abstract

Summary: Thousands of human long non—coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in cancers
and played important roles in a wide range of tumorigenesis. However, the functions of vast majority
of human lncRNAs are still elusive. Emerging studies revealed that the expression level of majority
lncRNAs shows discordant expression pattern with their protein—coding gene neighbors in various
model organisms. Therefore, it may be useful to infer lncRNAs’ potential biological function in cancer
development by more comprehensive functional views of co—expressed cancer genes beyond mere
physical proximity of genes. To this aim, we performed thorough searches and analyses of the inter—
actions between lncRNA and non—neighboring cancer genes and provide a comprehensive co—
expression data resource, LnCaNet. In current version, LnCaNet contains the pre—computed 8 494
907 significant co—expression pairs of 9641 lncRNAs and 2544 well—classified cancer genes in 2922
matched TCGA samples. In detail, we integrated 10 cancer gene lists from public database and calcu—
late the co—expression with all the lncRNAs in 11 TCGA cancer types separately. Based on the re—
sulted 110 co—expression networks, we identified 17 common regulatory pairs related to extracellular
space shared in 11 cancers. We expect LnCaNet will enable researcher to explore lncRNA expression
pattern, their affected cancer genes and pathways, biological significance in the context of specific
cancer types and other useful annotation related to particular kind of lncRNA—cancer gene
interaction.

Long non—coding RNA (lncRNA) refers as non—coding transcripts lon—
ger than 200 bases and are abundant in various normal and cancer
tissues (Kung et (11., 2013). Rather than being regarded as ‘transcrip—
tional noise’, there is emerging evidence that lncRNAs play important
roles in regulation of gene expression through inﬂuencing chromatin
modification, transcriptional complexes targeting, mRNA splicing,
protein translation (Rinn and Chang, 2012; Roberts et (11., 2014).
However, most lncRNAs are poorly annotated, and their functions
including their roles in complex diseases have not been widely
studies.

To bring a more functional information of human lncRNAs in can—
cer, we first collected 10 cancer gene lists such as experimentally
characterized tumor suppressors (Zhao et (11., 2013).

To provide the co—expression pattern of cancer genes with lncRNAs,
we downloaded all the lncRNAs expression data from Mitranscriptome
database (Iyer et (11., 2015). We estimated the expression correlation
among all the 2544 cancer genes and 17 250 lncRNA transcripts from
Mitranscriptome using the Spearman’s correlation based on matched
TCGA cancer samples. Based on the R language package (version
2.14.0), the expression correlation scores and corresponding P—values

were calculate. For all the P—values, a false discovery rate (FDR) was
applied to correct the statistical significance of multiple testing. Finally, 8
494 907 pairs with 9641 lncRNAs can satisfy our criteria that the abso—
lute expression correlation scores are greater than 0.3 and the FDR ad—
justed P—values are less than 0.01. In addition to gene—lncRNA co—
expression, we also computed lncRNA—lncRNA and gene—gene co—ex—
pression pairs based on same TCGA cancer samples for broader data
mining about collected cancer genes and lncRNAs in pan-cancer level.

and ‘Interaction’ on the top. For the pre-computed co—expression pat—
tern between cancer genes and lncRNAs, user can obtain the correl—
ation coefficients and the corrected statistical P—values (Fig. 1C). In
addition, the expression plots of the corresponding lncRNAs were also
integrated from MiTranscriptome database. All the 110 co—expression
networks are available to browse and download separately for
advanced integrative study.

Based on the pre—computed results of co—expression pairs in 1 1 can—
cers, we found thousands of co—expression pairs are shared in cancers
(Fig. 1E). For example, 17 pairs associated with 17 lncRNAs and 16
cancer genes are common in all 11 cancers. The gene CD24 has been
co—expressed with 2 lncRNAs across 11 cancers. Based on the func—
tional analysis, we found 6 cancer genes are mainly located extracellu—
lar space related to cell adhesion (Corrected enrichment P = 0.0335,
Supplementary Table S1), and 4 of them are clusters of differentiation

4 Conclusion

The pan—cancer analysis of the co—expression revealed that the
lncRNAs are frequently co—expressed with cancer genes in multiple
cancers. To provide a reusable resource for cancer community, we
published all the pre—computed networks about lncRNA and cancer
genes at http://lncanet.bioinfo—minzhao.org.

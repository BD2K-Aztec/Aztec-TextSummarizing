ABSTRACT

Motivation: Enzyme promiscuity, a property with practical
applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology, has been
related to the evolvability of enzymes. At the molecular level, several
structural mechanisms have been linked to enzyme promiscuity in
enzyme families. However, it is at present unclear to what extent
these observations can be generalized. Here, we introduce for the
first time a method for predicting catalytic and substrate promiscuity
using a graph-based representation known as molecular signature.
Results: Our method, which has an accuracy of 85% for the
non-redundant KEGG database, is also a powerful analytical tool
for characterizing structural determinants of protein promiscuity.
Namely, we found that signatures with higher contribution to the
prediction of promiscuity are uniformly distributed in the protein
structure of promiscuous enzymes. In contrast, those signatures that
act as promiscuity determinants are significantly depleted around
non-promiscuous catalytic sites. In addition, we present the study
of the enolase and aminotransferase superfamilies as illustrative
examples of characterization of promiscuous enzymes within a
superfamin and achievement of enzyme promiscuity by protein
reverse engineering. Recognizing the role of enzyme promiscuity in
the process of natural evolution of enzymatic function can provide
useful hints in the design of directed evolution experiments. We
have developed a method with potential applications in the guided
discovery and enhancement of latent catalytic capabilities surviving
in modern enzymes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Beyond the classical deﬁnition of enzyme as speciﬁc to the
substrate and reaction that catalyzes, enzymes can show the
capability of promiscuity, i.e. to catalyze more than one reaction
(catalytic promiscuity) or show broad substrate speciﬁcity (substrate
promiscuity) (Bornscheuer and Kazlauskas, 2004; Hult and
Berglund, 2007). Enzyme promiscuity has drawn considerable
attention in recent years due to its evolutionary and practical
implications (Copley, 2003; O’Brien and Herschlag, 1999). In fact,

enzyme promiscuity has been related to the evolvability of proteins,
as a mechanism that can be traced in the divergence of enzyme
families and superfamilies (Khersonsky et (11., 2006). Namely,
the conservation of structural and catalytic features observed in
enzyme superfamilies such as tautomerases (Poelarends et (11.,
2008), enolases (Babbitt et (11., 1996) and many others, suggests
that enzyme specialization arose via divergent evolution (gene
duplication and subsequent mutations) driven by environmental
selective pressure from promiscuous precursor enzymes. Inspired on
this mechanism of natural evolution, enzyme promiscuity has been
sought in the laboratory as a starting place for directed evolution
of enzymes capable of new functions (Yoshikuni et (11., 2006), such
as in biocatalysis (Bornscheuer and Kazlauskas, 2004), degradation
of novel synthetic chemicals (Copley, 2003) or in other innovative
ways in the context of synthetic biology (Andrianantoandro et (11.,
2006). These potential applications of enzyme promiscuity in
biotechnology have motivated the search of protein engineering
methods adding or enhancing latent catalytic activities in existing
enzymes, such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution
(Kazlauskas, 2005).

At the molecular level, several structural mechanisms have been
related to enzyme promiscuity. For instance, promiscuous binding
has been observed in a large hydrophobic cleft or cavity or in a region
with some other unusual structural feature (Copley, 2003). Similarly,
promiscuity has been linked in some cases to intrinsically disordered
regions in the protein (Kim et (11., 2008; Tyagi et (11., 2009), while in
other studies it has been related to conserved regions in the active
site (Anandarajah et (11., 2000). A promiscuous active site might
be able to accommodate different substrates, a feature that has been
linked to protein ﬂexibility, in particular to the mobility of active site
loops, which appears to play a key role in mediating promiscuity (Ma
et (11., 2005; Yasutake et (11., 2004). Furthermore, experiments have
revealed that residues inﬂuencing enzyme promiscuity go beyond
active residues contacting the substrate (O’Brien and Herschlag,
1999; Romero and Arnold, 2009). In fact, plasticity (Yoshikuni
et (11., 2006) or neutral (Babbitt et (11., 1996) residues (residues
which are not essential for core catalytic activity) lying along
the contour of the active site may hasten divergence, as it has
been observed in several 01/13 barrel superfamilies such as estareses
and lipases (Hegyi and Gerstein, 1999), enolases (Petsko, 2000),
ribulose-phosphate binding (Chan et (11., 2008), as well as in directed
evolution of isomerases (Jurgens et (11., 2000; Kuper et (11., 2005) or
aminotransferases (Rothman and Kirsch, 2003). Nevertheless, it is at
present unclear to what extent these observations can be generalized
to other enzyme families, since additional determinants such as post-
translational modiﬁcations, the presence of multiple domains, and
oligomeric states may be also affecting enzyme promiscuity, such as

Enzyme promiscuity prediction

 

in HisF from Thermotoga maritima (Taglieber et (11., 2007), or the
multidomain arom pentafunctional enzyme in yeast (Nobeli et (11.,
2009).

The aim of this article is to introduce a new method for predicting
enzyme promiscuity, which will allow us to investigate for the
ﬁrst time on genome-wide scales how residues participate as
determinants of promiscuity and their interrelation with catalytic
sites. Gaining insights into this question has important implications
for the design in biocatalysis and synthetic biology applications.
Predicting enzyme promiscuity, however, has been recognized as a
problem of daunting complexity (Nobeli et (11., 2009). Even though
some progress has been done in this ﬁeld (Carbonell et (11., 2009;
Gomez et (11., 2003; Macchiarulo et (11., 2004), there is still a need for
better and more accurate methods of prediction. Our approach uses
a graph-based representation known as molecular signature (Faulon
et (11., 2008). On this method, similarity between two molecules is
evaluated by comparison of their respective canonical subgraphs
(Faulon et (11., 2004). Here, we propose to use the signature
representation to build a tool for prediction of enzyme promiscuity
by means of graph kernel support vector machines (SVM; Gartner
et (11., 2003), which are machine-learning methods widely used as
classiﬁers and in regression (Vapnik, 1995). Our dataset consists of
the list of enzymes in the entire KEGG database (Kanehisa et (11.,
2008). An enzyme is labeled as having promiscuous catalytic activity
if it can process more than one different reaction. Similarity between
reactions was evaluated by using reaction molecular signatures.
After training and cross-validating a linear kernel SVM for the
prediction of enzyme promiscuity, the set of molecular signatures
contributing most to the determination of catalytic promiscuity was
subsequently used to analyze the inﬂuence of structural properties on
enzyme promiscuity. Potential applications in enzyme engineering
and synthetic biology were illustrated by looking at the signatures
distribution in the family of enolases and aminotransferases.

2 METHODS

Molecular signature: the molecular signature is a vector whose components
correspond to atomic signatures. Initially developed for chemicals (Faulon
et al., 2004), the signature molecular descriptor was later extended to protein
sequences (Faulon et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2005). Each component of a
molecular signature counts the number of occurrences of a particular atomic
signature in the molecule (see Supplementary Fig. S1). An atomic signature
is a canonical representation of the subgraph surrounding a particular atom.
This subgraph includes all atoms and bonds up to a predeﬁned distance from
the given atom. This distance is called the signature height h. If G=(V,E)
is a molecular graph, where vertices V correspond to atoms, and edges E to
bonds, then the molecular signature of G is given by

MG): 2 ham) (1)
xieV
where hope») is the atomic signature of G rooted at atom x, of height h.
Protein information can be encoded by using the signature molecular
descriptor as well. For proteins, signatures are similar to the k-mer spectrum
developed by Leslie et al. (2003). A residue signature consists of a residue
and its sequence neighbors within a window speciﬁed by its height h. For a
given sequence S, its signature of height h is deﬁned as

ho(S) = Elam) (2)
siES

where ham) is the k-mer signature of height h centered at residue s, of S.
Reaction signature: we assume that enzymatic reactions take the general
form R: s1S1+...+s,,S,, —>p1P1+...+p,,,Pm, where s, and p]- are the

stoichiometric coefﬁcients of substrates Si and products Pj. The signature
of reaction R of height h is deﬁned by

lam) = ijhUUDj) — Exhaust) (3)
j i

Reaction signature-basea1 characterization of enzyme catalytic
promiscuity: Enzyme catalytic promiscuity is deﬁned as the ability of an
enzyme to catalyze different type of reactions. Here, we use the reaction
signature of height h: 1 to characterize enzyme catalytic promiscuity (see
Supplementary Fig. S2 for an illustrative example). An enzyme is classiﬁed
as promiscuous if it can process dissimilar reactions, i.e. if the enzyme has
been annotated with at least a pair of reactions RA and RB with different
signatures.

Reaction signature-basea1 characterization of enzyme substrate
promiscuity: Substrate promiscuity of enzymes is deﬁned as the ability of an
enzyme to catalyze different substrates. It differs from catalytic promiscuity
in the sense that it is possible for catalytic reactions to process more than one
different substrate. We evaluated the substrate promiscuity of an enzyme
by counting the number of unique reaction signatures of their annotated
reactions extended over the height range of h=0 to 3 (see Supplementary
Figs S3 and S4 for illustrative examples).

SVM: to train a two-level classiﬁer SVM, data is presented as pairs
{(xi,yi)}eR” >< {:l:1} , where x, is the vector of input features, and y, is
its observed class (labeled as —1 and +1). The SVM computes the following
decision function for the input vector x:

f(x) = Ztiyier. xi>+b (4)

where k : R” X R” —> R is a kernel function, and A, and b are typically obtained
by solving a quadratic programming problem (Vapnik, 1995).
In our case, given an input sequence S, the input vector x, corresponds
to its signature descriptor ho(Si) of height h according to Equation (2)
and the output y, to one of the two classes {—1,+1}, which stand for
non-promiscuous and promiscuous enzymes, respectively. By deﬁnition,
the kernel function k(x,x,») performs a dot product in some vector space.
Following our previous work (Martin et al., 2005), here we used the signature
kernel function, which is given by the Euclidean dot product of signatures
as vectors in the multidimensional space formed by all possible k-mers of
height h
er.x,»>=has)-la(Si>=Z”q(S>”cq(si> (5)

Since the SVM in Equation (5) is using a linear kernel, it is possible to
express the decision function as a linear combination on the signature space

Equation (5) expresses the dot product in the sequence data space, and it
is a compact form for computing the SVM. Furthermore, Equation (6) based
on the long and sparse signature vectors space is also used in our present
study in order to analyze the individual contributions or ot-Values of each
k-mer to the output of the decision function.

Other kernel functions based on k-mers that have been proposed are
the mismatch string kernel (Leslie et al., 2003) and the local string
alignment kernel (Saigo et al., 2004). We have included in our study both
implementations from authors” sites in order to compare their performance
with our proposed kernel, which is given by Equation (5). To compute the
SVMs, we used a modiﬁcation of the SVM_light software with a custom
kernel based on signatures, as in Martin et al. (2005).

Sequence homology score: we implemented an enzyme promiscuity
homology-based score by querying a blast database built from the
non-redundant list of promiscuous and non-promiscuous enzymes in the

dataset. Predictions were given based on majority consensus of the input
sequence homologs up to the speciﬁed sequence identity cut-off.

Disorder- and hydrophobicity-based predictors: disorder and
hydrophobicity were computed for balanced sets of 1000 randomly
selected sequences from the positive and negative sets, respectively.
Disorder for each residue was measured based on the three parameters given
by the disembl predictor (Linding et al., 2003): loop/coils, hot loops and
missing coordinates. Receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves and
accuracy were computed by varying the threshold of the ratio of disordered
residues in the protein for each of the three parameters, and then averaged.
Similarly, the ratio of non-hydrophobic residues was used to compute the
ROC curve and accuracy for hydrophobicity.

Signature-based promiscuity predictor: predictions are given as
the average of the promiscuity prediction score given by the output of the
signature-based SVM and the homology score. z-score and P-Value for the
prediction are given based on the distribution of the predicted values in
the training set.

Cross-validation and performance measures: a 10-fold random cross-
Validation of the performance of the SVM was implemented by using a
balanced training and validation set containing 1000 example sequences,
which was repeated 500 times over the dataset. Statistics were compiled for
each dataset using the predictions from the cross-validation. Performance
was measured as follows: let TP, FP, TN and FN to denote true positive,
false positives, true negatives and false negatives, respectively, then accuracy
is deﬁned by (TP+TN)/(TP+ FP+TN+ FN), sensitivity is deﬁned by
TP/(TP+FN), and speciﬁcity is deﬁned by TN/(TN+FP). The area under
the ROC curve (AUC) is obtained by integrating under the ROC curve. The
ROC curve is obtained by varying the discrimination threshold separating
positives from negatives and plotting the TP rate (sensitivity) versus the FP
rate (1-speciﬁcity).

Dataset: we downloaded from the KEGG database (release 50) the list
of protein sequences with annotated catalytic activity. The dataset was
selected by taking those sequences in the initial list with fully deﬁned
stoichiometrically balanced reaction, totaling 498025 sequences (73% of
the complete list in KEGG). Reaction similarity at catalytic and substrate
level (see previous deﬁnitions) was computed between pairs of reactions
annotated for each enzyme. Based on reaction similarity, the sequence list
was split into positive set (promiscuous) and negative set (non-promiscuous).
Redundancy was removed within each set by using the cd-hit program
(Li and Godzik, 2006) at a threshold of 50% of sequence similarity.

Golden set: a golden set of 64 experimentally veriﬁed enzymes with
promiscuous catalytic activity was built by selecting sequences from the
BRENDA database (Chang et al., 2009) , where detailed information about
catalytic activities and the source of the information were available (see
Supplementary Table S1).

3D structures assignment: we performed a blast search for non-redundant
homolog PDB structures of enzyme sequences in the reference dataset, within
a similarity threshold of 80%. Prior to the structural assignment, consistency
between the annotated EC numbers in the KEGG database for the sequence
and its homolog was checked. Following this strategy, we were able to
identify model structures for 1035 different promiscuous enzymes, and 3491
non-promiscuous enzymes (see Supplementary Table S2).

Structural homology score: we downloaded the CATH (Orengo et al.,
1997) and SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995) structural classiﬁcations for the dataset
of enzyme structures. Structural homology predictions were given based on
majority consensus of promiscuous and non-promiscuous homologs of the
input structure.

Catalytic sites mapping: based on the Catalytic Site Atlas (Porter et al.,
2004), experimentally determined functional residues were mapped into
enzyme model 3D structures. Information about catalytic site residues was
identiﬁed for 1004 structures representing promiscuous enzymes and for
3406 non-promiscuous enzymes.

Secondary structure: secondary structure was assigned to the dataset of
structures using the DSSP server (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) labeling each

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Characterization of enzyme promiscuity in the reference dataset:
catalytic promiscuity is deﬁned as the ability of an enzyme to
catalyze more than one reaction. To study catalytic promiscuity, we
looked at the list of reactions annotated for enzyme sequences in
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2008). Even when reactions were labeled
with different names, there might be cases where they correspond to
the same chemical transformations. To prevent this redundancy, we
compared pairwise the reactions catalyzed by each enzyme through
the use of the molecular signature-based reaction similarity measure
(see Section 2). An enzyme was labeled as promiscuous if the
enzyme can catalyze at least two chemically different reactions.
We found in the dataset that 28% of enzymes are catalytically
promiscuous (Table 1). This percentage is substantially lower than
the number of enzymes annotated with more than one reaction in
KEGG (44%), as the study of promiscuous catalytic activity of
the enzyme at the reaction level is able to avoid redundancies in
reaction annotations. In turn, the number of promiscuous enzymes
is signiﬁcantly higher than the number of enzymes annotated with
more than one EC number (2%), illustrating the fact that EC number
annotations are in many cases a broader deﬁnition of catalytic
activity. Furthermore, we observed that 96% of enzymes annotated
with more than one EC number were actually catalyzing more than
one different reaction. In contrast, 42% of enzymes with only one
EC number were annotated with more than one different reaction.

Similarly, we used molecular signatures to compare substrates
catalyzed by each enzyme (see Section 2). We found that the number
of enzymes with substrate promiscuity is ~10% higher than the
number of enzymes with catalytic promiscuity, since the former
might include cases where a unique reaction is used by the enzyme
to process different substrates, whereas those cases were removed
from the latter.

In summary, although different EC annotations generally encode
for different reactions in KEGG, a single EC number can
contain several different reactions according to our reaction
similarity measures. For instance, EC 4.1.2.19 L—rhamnulose
1-phosphate aldolases (see Supplementary Fig. S2) are inducible
not only by L—rhamnose but also by its pentose analog L—lyxose

The performance of catalytic promiscuity prediction is evaluated for several types of predictors: signatures, mismatch, alignment and random kernel-based SVMs, sequence
and structural homology through CATH and SCOP, sequence length, disorder and hydrophobicity, respectively. Performance of the signatures-based SVM predictor of substrate

promiscuity is also given.

(Badia et al., 1991). Another example is EC 2.3.1.179, a ﬂ-ketoacyl-
carrier-protein synthase II (see Supplementary Fig. S3) with a unique
catalytic reaction signature that can process different substrates
depending on the acyl group, acetyl or butyryl (Wu et al., 2009).
Our predictions, thus, rely on how well sequences are annotated with
EC numbers and how accurately reactions have been mapped into
these EC numbers. Without doubt, we can expect misannotations
with both, the EC numbers and the reactions. However, even after
removing all close homologs, the accuracies that we reached in our
predictions (85%) are well above a random classiﬁer or a homology-
based classiﬁer. These cross-validation accuracies indicate that even
if the training set might not be perfect, promiscuity can still be learnt
using k-mer signatures.

Eﬁ’ect of protein features on catalytic promiscuity: ﬁrst, we
consider the effect of sequence length on enzyme promiscuity,
as is the case in multi-domain proteins where functional sites
might be located in different domains of the protein. Catalytic
promiscuity is deﬁned as the ability of an enzyme to process
different reactions through the same active site and, therefore,
sequence length is not expected to be a determinant effect in the
prediction of promiscuity. As a matter of fact, we tested sequence
length as a predictive parameter of promiscuity in our dataset,
obtaining an AUC (see deﬁnition in Section 2) of 0.47, which
is a non-discriminant value for predicting purposes. Similarly, we
tested the effect of hydrophobicity and protein disorder on enzyme
promiscuity. In both cases, accuracy and AUC were again around
0.53 (Table 2).

Prediction of catalytic promiscuity using molecular signatures:
our approach to enzyme promiscuity prediction is based on the use
of protein molecular signatures as vector representations of protein
sequences by its amino acid strings or k-mers, which can be used
to develop a signature-based SVM (see details in Section 2). This
approach has proven in the past to be information rich and efﬁcient
for predicting enzymatic ﬁinction (Faulon et al., 2008) such as our
present study on enzyme promiscuity prediction. The performance
of the proposed SVM as an enzyme catalytic promiscuity predictor
was evaluated by means of a 10-fold cross validation of the dataset
(Table 2), obtaining an overall average accuracy 85% (AUC = 0.89),
with 87% (AUC=0.90) for prokaryotes and 88% (AUC=0.91)
for eukaryotes. Similar performance values were obtained for the
mismatch and local alignment kernels, as it is shown in Table 2.
Indeed, after running the three kernels on 500 datasets, the SD of
the accuracy and AUC for each kernel was found to be 0.02 and
0.03, respectively. This performance of the kemel-based predictor is

signiﬁcantly higher than the performance obtained for analogous sets
of sequences randomly labeled as promiscuous/non-promiscuous, as
shown in Table 2.

Prediction of substrate promiscuity using molecular signatures:
similar to the previous section, we performed a cross-validation of
the proposed SVM-based predictor for the prediction of substrate
promiscuity. Accuracy values ranged from 88% (AUC=0.91) for
eukaryotes to 89% (AUC = 0.93) in prokaryotes (Table 2).

Comparison with a homology-based predictor: we compared
the performance of our signature-based predictor with a sequence
homology-based predictor of catalytic promiscuity, which we built
from the non-redundant dataset by using blast (Altschul et al.,
1990) (details can be found in Section 2). A cross-validation
test similar to the one performed on our predictor and described
previously was applied to this homology predictor. Results are
shown in Table 2. We performed the test for different cut-off
levels in the sequence homology similarity, obtaining an increasing
accuracy as we lowered the cut-off, i.e. increased the number of
homologs included in the prediction, with maximum accuracy of
73% (AUC=0.70) for a sequence similarity of 20% or below. A
more accurate homology predictor might be obtained based on
information which goes beyond sequence similarity, as is the case
in the structural homology predictors CATH and SCOP. We used
these databases in order to build a structural homology predictor, as
it is described in Section 2. Results for the dataset (Table 2) show
an improvement, specially for the SCOP-based predictor, which had
an accuracy of 77% (AUC = 0.79).

Therefore, predictions based on sequence homology had lower
performance compared with our predictor. Furthermore, from a
technical point of view the main advantage of our signatures-based
predictor over a homology-based predictor is that signatures might
provide to protein designers a way to identify those residues that are
contributing most as determinants of catalytic promiscuity through
the use of the top k-mers, as it will be presented in the next sections.

Predictions for the promiscuity golden set: the performance
obtained for the homology-based predictor might be due to the
presence of homology annotations in KEGG. As a matter of fact,
sequences in the non-redundant dataset might still have been
annotated in KEGG by homology, because removing redundancy
does not change the annotations of the remaining sequences. To
circumvent this problem, we performed an additional validation
by using the promiscuity golden set, a set of 64 enzymes with
experimentally associated multiple reactions in BRENDA. After
removing homologs of the golden set sequences from the dataset, we

repeatedly trained our promiscuity predictor, obtaining an average
accuracy of 75% in the predictions for this subset.

Top signatures contributing to the prediction of promiscuity:
we investigated the distribution of signatures in the positive and
negative sets in order to identify those signatures or k-mers that
are contributing most to the prediction of enzyme promiscuity.
Identifying k-mers that most contribute to promiscuity will be
subsequently used in this study to characterize promiscuity at
sequence and structural level. The procedure is as follows: during
the training of the SVM, the algorithm assigns a weight (at-value)
to each k-mer in the training set (see Section 2). Thereafter these
values are used to compute the prediction of a given sequence based
on its signature or vector of occurrences of each particular k-mer.
Thus, k-mers with top absolute ot-values have been determined by
the SVM algorithm either to contribute most to enzyme promiscuity
or to correspond to non-promiscuous enzyme signatures with the
lowest ot-values. Selecting top k-mers based exclusively on the
highest absolute ot-values of the SVM might not be in some
cases the best selection method, specially if there exists strong
correlation between the input features. To test the efﬁciency of a
selection based on k-mers with top ot-values, we compared our
selection with a more robust method known as recursive feature
selection (Guyon et al., 2002). We observed, however, that for a
selection of 1000 top k-mers, there is a substantial overlap between
both methods (>75%), indicating that a selection based on top Ot-
values is representative for promiscuity determinants (see details
in Supplementary Fig. S5). The discriminant power of these top
k-mers was assessed by performing a 10-fold cross-validation test
(see Supplementary Table S3), where it is shown that a set of 1000
top k-mers was signiﬁcant enough in this test to give performance
values close to the values achieved with the SVM at signature heights
in the range h: 3 to 5. A set of 1000 k-mers spans a small subspace
of the total k-mer space, which has a total dimension of 20h for
height h. Therefore, for the list of enzyme sequences in the KEGG
database, we observed that a relatively small set of k-mers with high
ot-values can act as determinants of enzyme promiscuity.

The amino acid content of the 1000 top k-mers differs from the
general distribution in the dataset. In general, aromatic (Tyr, Trp,
Phe) and other bulky amino acids such as Met, Hist are less present
in promiscuous signatures, whereas small amino acids such as Gly
and Ala are more frequent (see Supplementary Table S4). A detailed
analysis of several physicochemical properties of top k-mers can be
found in Supplementary Figs S6 and S7. In general, top k-mers are
lighter and with smaller total solvent accessibility area, which might
be associated with its lower catalytic or substrate speciﬁcity.

S ignatures-based structural analysis of promiscuous enzymes: no
prior structural or catalytic site information was used in the training
of the signature-based SVM. Thus, it might be of interest to analyze
how top predictive signatures locations in the protein structure relate
to catalytic sites of promiscuous enzymes. We built for this purpose
a database of 3D structures derived from the KEGG database, as
described in the Section 2. Catalytic residues were mapped in the
structures by using the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA), which contains
residues that have been determined to play a central role in the
catalytic mechanism using deﬁned criteria (Porter et al., 2004). By
computing contact maps of catalytic residues at different distance
values, and the corresponding list of k-mers for each contacting
residue, the average ot-value of these k-mers gave an estimate of the
contribution of residues around catalytic sites to the promiscuity of

the enzyme. In Figure 1, we plotted the relationship between the
distance radius and average ot-values for the set of promiscuous
and non-promiscuous enzymes. Signatures of k-mers are clearly
split into positive and negative average values for promiscuous
and non-promiscuous enzymes, respectively, with independence
of the distance to the catalytic site. Furthermore, we observed a
distinctive trend on the average ot-value around catalytic sites in non-
promiscuous enzymes that is signiﬁcant compared with the average
values observed around random residues. Namely, non-promiscuous
catalytic sites or highly speciﬁc enzymes have lower ot-values in
k-mers as residues become closer to catalytic residues in the distance
range of ~5—20 A. This is not the case in promiscuous enzymes,
which appear to be more regularly distributed and essentially
independent of the distance to the catalytic site. In this sense,
the distribution of k-mers around catalytic sites in promiscuous
enzymes is similar to the distribution around any other residue in
the promiscuous enzyme and, on average, signiﬁcantly higher than
values around non-promiscuous catalytic sites. Therefore, we argue
that from the molecular signature point of view, our results suggest
that there exist some distinctive k-mers present in promiscuous
enzymes, which are usually found distributed uniformly along
the protein structure. In contrast, what confers speciﬁcity to non-
promiscuous enzymes is precisely the existence of some functional
regions in the protein containing speciﬁc signatures usually not
found in promiscuous enzymes.

Secondary structure and enzyme promiscuity: despite the fact that
evolutionary and structural properties of proteins have been pointed
out by several authors as determinants of enzyme promiscuity; in
general, there is no direct linkage between promiscuity and most of
these properties measured for the entire sequences. Bartlett et a1.
(2002) already addressed the role of secondary structure in catalytic
sites by looking at the residues in the CSA. We supplement here
the study of these authors by looking at the secondary structure
for the particular case of promiscuous catalytic sites. Results are
shown in Table 3. The observed difference between the distribution

of secondary structures for all residues and catalytic sites is in good
agreement with the results in Bartlett et a1. (2002). That is, helices
are in general underrepresented in catalytic residues. Interestingly,
beta strands, which are known to be more conserved than other
secondary structures (Sitbon and Pietrokovski, 2007), contain 30%
of the catalytic residues, a percentage that is 10% higher than in
non-promiscuous enzymes, and signiﬁcantly 15% higher than in
random residues. The percentage of helices in catalytic sites for
both types of enzymes is around 30%, a 10% lower than in random
residues, while the percentage of loops remains around 40% in all
cases. Figure 2 plots the deviation from random of the distribution
of secondary structures around catalytic sites for residues within
different distances to catalytic sites. On average, enrichment in beta
strands is clearly kept in promiscuous enzymes within the distance
range 0—20 A.

Application: catalytic promiscuous members of the enolase
superfamily: enzymes mandalate racemase (EC 5.1.2.2) and
muconate lactonizing (EC 5.5.1.1) are divergent members of the
enolase superfarnily that catalyze overall different reactions to

produce their speciﬁc products (Hult and Berglund, 2007). In
some cases, it has been also observed catalytic promiscuity as a
N -acylamino acid racemase (annotated in KEGG as EC 4.2.1.113)
(Glasner et al., 2006). We selected from the KEGG database those
non-redundant sequences in the enolase superfamily annotated with
at least one of these catalytic reactions. Of the 346 sequences in the
list, 33 out of 36 sequences were correctly classiﬁed as promiscuous
enzymes, and 277 out of 310 in the case of non-promiscuous
enzymes, which gives an accuracy of 90% and a sensitivity of 92%.
This example illustrates the application of the method in order to
identify potential members of an enzyme family or superfarnily
showing catalytic promiscuity.

Application: reverse engineering of a promiscuous amino-
transferase: Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (AATase,
EC 2.6.1.1.) and tyrosine aminotransferase (TATase, EC 2.6.1.5)
are two non-promiscuous enzymes of the same superfarnily, which
share a 43% sequence identity. Directed evolution of AATase
to TATase activity (Rothman and Kirsch, 2003) showed that the
new function can be acquired by mutagenesis without losing its
original AATase function, suggesting that both enzymes arose by
duplication from an ancestral promiscuous protein. We use here the
promiscuity predictor to evaluate which signatures in the evolved
mutant contributed most to the enhancement of its promiscuity.
The SVM, trained with Prokaryote data and signature height h :4,
predicted an increase in substrate promiscuity for the evolved mutant
8-2B (Rothman and Kirsch, 2003). We computed z-scores for Ot-
values in wild type AATase and the selected variant after all rounds
of directed evolution. Signatures centered in residues P13, I291 and
A383 gave the highest contribution to the prediction of promiscuity
(z > 1). Obviously, changes in signatures ot-values took place around
point mutations, in this case P13T, A293V and A381V (Fig. 3).
These three signatures are located in loops. It has been postulated
that greater ﬂexibility of the loops in TATase than in AATase is an
important speciﬁcity determinant (Ishijima et al., 2000). Signature
in Prol3 is located on the mobile loop that precedes the substrate
binding pocket. This signature also includes Asp15, which forms a
salt bridge with Arg292, in the second signature, a contact residue for
the inhibitor maleate (Rothman and Kirsch, 2003). Finally, signature
in Ala383, which is located far away from the substrate is in the
vincinity of Arg386, whose side chain directly interacts with the
ot-carboxylate group of the substrates (Yano et al., 1998). This study
illustrates the potential application of our predictor as a tool in
protein engineering to analyze ﬁinctional regions on the enzyme
contributing to the mechanism of promiscuity.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

The Promis server: the Promis server is a web-based implementation
of our method that provides predictions of catalytic and substrate
promiscuity on enzyme sequences by an SVM trained on molecular
signatures. The user inputs enzyme sequences in FASTA format and
the server returns the predicted score (z-score and P-value) for both
catalytic and substrate promiscuity. Users can select the taxonomic
group and the molecular signature height used for training. In the
predictor output, residues are coloured based on the ot-value of
the k-mers, i.e. the contribution of each residue to the prediction.
These values can be downloaded as a text ﬁle and, for instance,
incorporated into subsequent protein design pipelines.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Predicting enzyme promiscuity is a challenging task, which has
remained elusive. Here, we introduced for the ﬁrst time a method
for predicting catalytic and substrate promiscuity using a graph-
based representation known as molecular signature with potential
applications in biocatalysis and protein engineering. Our analysis
of the entire non-redundant list of enzymes sequences in KEGG
revealed that, in general, there is no clear pattern between
enzyme promiscuity and protein features such as sequence length,
hydrophobicity, disorder or type of catalytic activity. Our approach
to this problem was to implement a molecular signature-based
SVM for the prediction of catalytic and substrate promiscuity.
By training and cross-validating a kernel based-predictor using
the entire non-redundant list of enzymes sequences in the KEGG
database, we obtained an accuracy value of 85%. Furthermore, the
use of linear kernels in the SVM allowed us to decompose its output
into the individual contributions of signatures to the prediction
of catalytic promiscuity. Looking at the signiﬁcance of the set of
signatures, which are enriched in the positive or promiscuous list of
enzymes, we conclude that there exists a subset of signatures that
act as determinants of enzyme promiscuity. Molecular signatures,
therefore, can be used as an analytical tool to explore the role of
residues contributing to enzyme promiscuity.

We studied some of the signature-based determinants of enzyme
promiscuity. In general, signatures facilitating promiscuity contain
lighter amino acids with smaller total solvent accessibility area,

which might be associated with its lower catalytic or substrate
speciﬁcity. Furthermore, we found that beta sheets, which are
known to be more conserved than other secondary structures, play
a role facilitating promiscuity. At genome-wide scales, inspection
of the spatial neighbouring region around promiscuous and non-
promiscuous catalytic sites in the CSA revealed a region of
~20A surrounding catalytic sites where signatures are signiﬁcantly
contributing to the speciﬁcity in non-promiscuous enzymes, in
contrast with promiscuous enzymes, which contain signatures
distributed uniformly around catalytic sites.

The enolase and aminotransferase superfamilies were chosen as
case studies to illustrate the ability of our method to predict catalytic
and susbstrate promiscuity within members of the same family. In
the case of aminotransferases, it is known that catalytic promiscuity
can be achieved by directed evolution of residues in the area
surrounding the catalytic site by means of increasing loop ﬂexibility.
How this process could be analyzed by reverse engineering using
a signature kernel-based SVM prediction, illustrates some of the
potential applications of our method, since it can provide useful
hints in the design of directed evolution experiments and guide us
to discover and enhance latent catalytic capabilities surviving in
modern enzymes.

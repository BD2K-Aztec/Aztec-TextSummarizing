Where visual inspection indicates errors in the automated seg—
mentation or tracking, an interface for manual correction is
available. False detections can be removed with a mouse click
using the Cell Tracking Module. Poorly segmented cells can be
either improved or discarded. Developers can easily incorporate
other tracking algorithms for other types of migration patterns,
or cell parameters as presented recently (Georgescu et al., 2012).
Options for manual correction of the tracks include rejection of
invalid track points, deﬁnition of a new track point, track split—
ting (following a cell division) and track ﬂipping. Finally, all
tracks can be ﬁltered out by optional parameters such as velocity
and length.

Massively parallel analysis. Quantitative information about
morphological and geometric descriptors of each cell is extracted
and logged. Next, the Measurements Module enables visualiza—
tion and data exploration to quantify the spatiotemporal history
of a specific cell, record data on population basis and quantify
properties such as asymmetry of ﬂuorescence. TACTICS can
analyse multi—spectral images of multiple labelled cells, enabling
quantiﬁcation of intracellular protein localization by combining
one channel for segmentation and tracking, a second channel for
alignment and a third channel to quantify the protein of interest.
Once defined, a customized list of cell features such as morph—
ology, cell migration, ﬂuorescence ratiometric coefﬁcients and
protein localization is automatically generated and saved to a
selected folder in the multiple—position batch mode to create
data libraries. The list is adaptable, and developers can easily
add other features by requirement (Schindelin et al., 2012).
Importantly, these parameters can be displayed and compared
on a cell—by—cell basis, and the data can be ‘gated’ on the basis of
individual parameters to determine correlations between differ—
ent parameters as demonstrated previously (Pham et al., 2013).

The Measurements Module allows the combined quantiﬁca—
tion and visualization from multiple channels, such as the ability
to track interactions between cells in different channels.
Applications include the generation of lineage trees to track cel—
lular behaviours over many generations, and traceable descrip—
tors of immune cell velocity with direction of movement and
proximity to other interacting cells. Each module in TACTICS
can be re—called repeatedly for each position by using the Robust
Module to automate the extraction of multi—parameter informa—
tion from many simultaneously imaged individual cells on a
population basis. Thus, TACTICS provides high—throughput

automation with minimum human intervention, with the cap—
acity to refer back to the original images throughout the process.
In summary, TACTICS provides both ease of use for biologists
with limited software expertise, as well as the ﬂexibility for de—
velopers to incorporate additional bioinformatic processes for
cell segmentation and cell tracking.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

TACTICS source code is distributed under the BSD Licence.

TACTICS can be installed as a MATLAB app or by unpack—
ing a compressed file to the desired folder. It requires at least
MATLAB 7.6 (R2008a) with the presence of Image Processing®
and Statistics® Toolboxes. Several shared third—party functions
are used within the main TACTICS folder, and need be add—
itionally installed. All these ﬁles are located in separate
open—code subfolders, with proper acknowledgements to its con—
tributors including direct links to the original ﬁles.

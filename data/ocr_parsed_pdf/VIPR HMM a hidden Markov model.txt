ABSTRACT

Motivation: Current methods in diagnostic microbiology typically focus
on the detection of a single genomic locus or protein in a candidate
agent. The presence of the entire microbe is then inferred from this
isolated result. Problematically, the presence of recombination in
microbial genomes would go undetected unless other genomic loci
or protein components were specifically assayed. Microarrays lend
themselves well to the detection of multiple loci from a given microbe;
furthermore, the inherent nature of microarrays facilitates highly parallel
interrogation of multiple microbes. However, none of the existing meth-
ods for analyzing diagnostic microarray data has the capacity to spe-
cifically identify recombinant microbes. In previous work, we developed
a novel algorithm, VIPR, for analyzing diagnostic microarray data.
Results: We have expanded upon our previous implementation of
VIPR by incorporating a hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect
recombinant genomes. We trained our HMM on a set of non-
recombinant parental viruses and applied our method to 11 recom-
binant alphaviruses and 4 recombinant flaviviruses hybridized to a
diagnostic microarray in order to evaluate performance of the HMM.
VIPR HMM correctly identified 95% of the 62 inter-species recombin-
ation breakpoints in the validation set and only two false-positive
breakpoints were predicted. This study represents the first description
and validation of an algorithm capable of detecting recombinant
viruses based on diagnostic microarray hybridization patterns.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recombination constitutes an important source of genetic vari-
ation among Viruses. As an evolutionary mechanism, recombin-
ation leads to new Viral genotypes with potentially novel
biological properties and/or clinical manifestations. Vaccine-
derived poliovirus is one example of a Virus for which

recombination may play an important role in the progression
of disease. Recombination between vaccine-derived poliovirus
and coxsackie Virus has been shown to increase neurovirulence
of recombinant progeny and may be responsible for the emer-
gence of pathogenic vaccine-derived poliovirus (Jegouic et al.,
2009). In addition, H1N1 influenza and Ngari Viruses provide
examples in which novel genotypes consisting of genomic seg-
ments derived from multiple different parental Viruses have led to
disease outbreaks. HlNl, the inﬂuenza Virus responsible for the
2009 outbreak of pandemic ﬂu, is thought to have arisen from
the successive reassortment of four different strains of inﬂuenza
A (Neumann et al., 2009). Ngari Virus, a hemorrhagic
fever-causing bunyavirus, is thought to have resulted from the
natural reassortment of two Viruses, Bunyamwera and Batai
Viruses, neither of which is known to cause hemorrhagic fever
(Briese et al., 2006; Gerrard et al., 2004). Given that recombin-
ation and reassortment can play important roles in producing
novel variations that are implicated in pathological outcomes,
the ability for clinicians to identify novel recombinant and reas-
sortant Viruses in diagnostic laboratories is highly desirable.

In addition to occurring naturally through evolution, recom-
binant and reassortant Viruses can also be deliberately created in
the laboratory. In vitro recombination has proven to be a useful
tool for engineering novel Viruses with properties desirable for
the development of vaccines (Atasheva et al., 2009; Brandler
et al., 2005). However, this also means that recombination and
reassortment have the potential to be used maliciously to develop
novel agents of bioterrorism. Such agents could be engineered
as highly pathogenic new Viral genotypes consisting of the
components of previously described Viruses including non-
pathogenic Viruses. Anticipating the possible use of recombin-
ant-/reassortant—based bioweapons should guide our efforts in
preparing to respond to such attacks. In such cases, the ability
to detect novel agents quickly and accurately would be critical.
Thus, it is imperative that any assay used to detect agents of
bioterrorism include novel recombinants and reassortants as pos-
sible outcomes.

Microarrays are well suited to detecting recombination and
reassortment and have an important advantage over traditional
diagnostic methods because they allow for the interrogation of
multiple loci from multiple Viruses in parallel. Traditional meth-
ods for microbial detection, such as polymerase chain reaction

(PCR) and antibody-based methods, are generally limited to de-
tecting only one genome segment or one protein per assay. The
inference is then made that the entire genome is present given
that a small part of the genome (or proteome) was detected.
Unless other loci are speciﬁcally assayed, this diagnostic para-
digm does not account for the possibility that a recombinant or
reassortant Virus is present. There have been many reports of the
efﬁcacy of microarrays as a tool for Viral diagnosis and discovery
(McLoughlin, 2011). Although many different probe design
strategies and platforms have been proposed for diagnostic
microarrays, all approaches require an objective method for in-
terpreting the raw hybridization patterns.

The method must be able to make diagnostic calls in the pres-
ence of technical noise, biological noise (i.e. cross-hybridization
to host) and probe saturation. Published examples of such
methods with downloadable or web-accessible software include
E-Predict (Urisman et al., 2005), DetectiV (Watson et al., 2007),
PhyloDetect (Rehrauer et al., 2008), CLiMax (Gardner et al.,
2010) and VIPR (Allred et al., 2010). Although these methods
have been shown to perform with high accuracy, none of them
was designed to be able to identify novel recombinant or reas-
sortant Viruses from a hybridization pattern.

One feature of VIPR, which stands for V1ral Identiﬁcation
with a PRobabilistic algorithm, is that it relies on an empirical
training set of positive and negative control hybridizations to
leverage diagnostic predictions. In this article, we describe the
expansion of VIPR to accommodate the possibility of recombin-
ation between candidate Viruses included in the training set. We
accomplished this by incorporating a hidden Markov model
(HMM) into our method in order to deﬁne recombinant paths

when calculating probabilities for candidate Viruses (Fig. 1).
Figure 2 shows the details of constructing the HMM. The
Viterbi algorithm was used to determine the optimal path from
which recombination breakpoints could be inferred. As with
VIPR, our HMM allows us to take advantage of training data
consisting of hybridizations of known Viruses to a microarray to
make predictions for unknown infections. The incorporation of
an HMM into VIPR now provides a probabilistic framework for
assessing the presence of recombination between candidate par-
ental Viruses. To validate our approach, we applied our HMM to
a set of 15 recombinant Viruses consisting of members of the
Alphavirus and Flavivirus genera, each of which was hybridized
in duplicate to a custom microarray. A set of microarrays to
which non-recombinant alphaviruses and ﬂaviviruses were hybri-
dized constituted the training data for the HMM. Although our
test focused on the validation of a set of recombinant alpha-
viruses and ﬂaviviruses, the strategy should be generalizable to
detecting recombination among members of a given Viral family.

RNA was puriﬁed from cell cultures that were infected with each

sequently randomly ampliﬁed and hybridized to a custom diag-
nostic microarray. Sixty-ﬁve hybridizations (60 representing
non-recombinant alphavirus and ﬂavivirus parental Viruses + 5
representing uninfected Vero cells) were performed in order to
obtain a training set for the HMM. For validation of our algo-
rithm, 49 hybridizations (30 representing alphavirus and ﬂavi-

Fig. 1. Overall strategy for using an HMM to identify recombinant and non-recombinant viruses hybridized to a microarray. Probe intensities indicative
of binding can implicate the presence of a single virus (left) or the presence of different viruses for different loci (right). This pattern of intensities can be
used to identify an optimal path through an HMM whose states represent binding or non-binding events between probes (columns) and virus genomes
(rows). Non-recombinant paths, such as the one on the left, involve transitions only between states in the same row, while paths that move from one row
to another are indicative of recombination (as exempliﬁed in the path on the right)

non-recombinants+4 representing uninfected Vero cells) were
performed.

In order to build the HMM, we first needed to establish a
framework to deﬁne possible recombinant and non-recombinant
paths based on positional information inherent to each probe.
The microarray probes were ordered by their position from 5/ to

3/ in the global alignment of candidate Virus genomes (Fig. 2).
This was accomplished by mapping the set of oligonucleotide
probes through local alignment (megablast) to each candidate
Virus genome, identifying probes for which the theoretical free
energy associated with its probe:genome local alignment was
5—30 kcal/mol [indicative of binding using previously explained
criteria (Allred et al., 2010)], and converting the midpoint of the
probe:genome local alignment for each of those probes to its
corresponding position in the global alignment (Edgar, 2004)
of candidate Virus genomes. Probes that mapped to multiple
genomes at similar positions but were offset relative to each
other by 30 nucleotides or fewer were consolidated to a single
position in the global alignment. Probes were then sorted by their
positions in the global alignment of candidate Virus genomes.

Once the probes were ordered, they were assigned 0n and Oﬂ
states for each genome. These assignments were based on the
same theoretical free energy of binding calculated in the mapping
step. 011 and Oﬂ states emit normalized and loge-transformed
intensities according to normal distributions estimated from
training data as previously described (Allred et al., 2010).
Thus, all emission probabilities e(state, intensity) were derived
from distributions estimated in a manner identical to the estima-
tion of probe-speciﬁc 0n and Oﬂ distributions in VIPR except in
the case where there were fewer than eight intensities available in
the training set for a given probe. In that case, the mean of the
distribution was calculated from the available intensities, but the
standard deviation was derived from the average standard devi-
ation over all probes with a similar On or Oﬂ prediction. In
addition to the candidate Virus genomes, a null genome was
included which represented a none-of—the-above genome predic-
tion and was assigned an Oﬂ state for each probe.

Finally, the states in the HMM were connected through tran-
sitions t(state, state) as depicted in Figure 2. As with HMMs that
have been developed to detect recombination in sequence, prob-
abilities representing recombination transitions could not be esti-
mated directly from the training data as could the other HMM
parameters (Schultz et al., 2006). Thus, a user-speciﬁed probabil-
ity of recombination parameter P(Rec0mb) was introduced to
compute transition probabilities. Transitions connecting states
within the same genome, i.e. t(stateV,-,,,,A, stateVimA) represented
non-recombination events and had the associated probability
1—P(Rec0mb). Transitions between genomes, i.e. (Mater/WM,
stateVimsB) represented recombination events and had the asso-
ciated probability P(Rec0mb)/(n—1), where n is the number of

candidate Virus genomes (including the ‘null’ genome). In some
cases, multiple probes mapped to the same position in the global
alignment of candidate Virus genomes. Transitions between
states whose probes mapped to the same position were only
allowed if those states corresponded to the same genome and
were assigned a probability of 1.0, such that recombination
events were not permitted between such states. Because the
next state in the model is dependent only on the current state,
and because states in the model emit from continuous intensity
distributions, the model is a first-order continuous HMM.

Two models were built and were used to analyze the alpha-
viruses and the ﬂaviviruses, respectively. In order to experimen-
tally deﬁne a suitable P(Rec0mb) for computing transition
probabilities, we evaluated the performance of VIPR HMM on
a subset of parental Viruses, varying P(Rec0mb) over a range of
values. We selected the maximum value of P(Rec0mb) that re-
sulted in zero false-positive recombination breakpoints when
Viterbi was applied to the parental alphaviruses. This value,
P(Rec0mb) = 10—25, was subsequently used when applying
VIPR HMM to the parental ﬂaviviruses as well as to the alpha-
virus and ﬂavivirus recombinants. The Viterbi results were com-
pared with expected results based on the known sequences of the
recombinant constructs. When applied to the ﬁve ﬂavivirus
non-recombinants, VIPR HMM classiﬁed each as the correct
species. Additionally, the four uninfected Vero samples were ac-
curately classiﬁed as null. VIPR HMM detected no recombin-
ation breakpoints for these samples except for one false-positive
breakpoint at the 3/ end of the dengue Virus 4 genome, which
bypassed the ﬁnal 254 nt of the genome in favor of null states.
VIPR HMM results for the non-recombinant alphaviruses and
ﬂaviviruses are shown in Supplementary Figure S1.

A total of 30 hybridizations of recombinant Viruses were ana-
lyzed by VIPR HMM. Supplementary Figure S2 shows the re-
sults for all recombinant alphaviruses and ﬂaviviruses analyzed
by VIPR HMM. Of the 30 hybridizations, 28 represented double
recombinants between two parent Viruses of distinct species and
two represented triple recombinants composed of three distinct
parental species. Thus, the total number of expected inter-species
recombination breakpoints was (28 x 2) + (2 x 3): 62. VIPR
HMM correctly identiﬁed breakpoints and the identity of the
parental species for 59 of the 62 total breakpoints. In the remain-
ing three instances, VIPR HMM yielded false negatives. Of all
the recombinant and non-recombinant samples analyzed by
VIPR HMM, only two false-positive breakpoints were predicted
(one in a non-recombinant Virus and one in a double recombin-
ant Virus which was incorrectly identified as a triple recombinant
by VIPR HMM). VIPR HMM results for a subset of the recom-
binant Viruses that were identiﬁed unambiguously are shown in
Figure 3A.

In some cases, the recombinant Viruses we used included
intra-species recombination breakpoints. Of the eight
intra-species breakpoints, two were identiﬁed by VIPR HMM.
For those two breakpoints, the correct Viruses 5/ and 3/ of the
breakpoint were identified (both species and strain). VIPR
HMM results for a subset of the recombinant Viruses that gave
unexpected results are shown in Figure 3B.

VIPR HMM was used to estimate the nucleotide positions of
each breakpoint in each parental genome. The nucleotide pos-
itions associated with recombination breakpoints were estimated

other. Additionally, an intra-species recombination breakpoint was not identiﬁed in either hybridization. R15 is a triple recombinant for which all three
inter-species recombination breakpoints were identiﬁed in both hybridizations, but for which an intra-species recombination breakpoint was not

identiﬁed in either

based on the position in the alignment of the probes associated
with the recombinant transition in the Viterbi path. For each
such probe, its position in the alignment was correlated with a
position in the Viterbi-speciﬁed parental Virus genome to esti-
mate the nucleotide position of the recombination breakpoint in
that genome (see spreadsheet in the Supplementary Material).
The differences between the nucleotide positions estimated by
VIPR and the actual sequence positions ranged from 0 to 90 nt.

3 DISCUSSION

The ability of DNA microarrays to simultaneously assess the
presence of multiple loci in microbial genomes is highly advan-
tageous for detecting recombination between Virus species in a
diagnostic setting. Despite this, none of the existing methods for
analyzing diagnostic microarrays is designed to accommodate
the detection of recombinant Viruses. In previous work, we de-
veloped VIPR, a method for objectively interpreting diagnostic
microarrays. One of the advantages of VIPR relative to other
methods is that it relies on a training set of empirical hybridiza-
tions of Virally infected and uninfected samples to leverage diag-
nostic predictions. We anticipated that relying on a training set
of hybridizations from known Viral infections would also help us
predict recombination between Virus species. In this study, we
developed an HMM parameterized with VIPR probability dis-
tributions to detect recombination in unknown infections.

VIPR HMM performed with high accuracy when identifying
recombination breakpoints between Viral species (59/62 such
breakpoints were identiﬁed and the correct Virus species 5’ and
3’ to the breakpoint were identiﬁed in each case). Of the eight
intra-species breakpoints in our dataset, two were identiﬁed by
VIPR HMM. Given that a much higher percentage of
inter-species breakpoints were detected than were intra-species
breakpoints (95 versus 25%), these results demonstrate that
VIPR HMM is more effective at detecting recombination be-
tween species than between strains belonging to the same species.
The ability of VIPR HMM to distinguish between strains of the
same species involved in recombination is likely inﬂuenced by the
degree of sequence divergence between the two strains. VIPR
HMM correctly identiﬁed the intra-species breakpoint in both
hybridizations of R12 (Fig. 3). The two strains comprising the
intra-species breakpoint for R12 are 23% divergent on the nu-
cleotide level. However, VIPR HMM was not able to identify the
intra-species breakpoint in either hybridization of R14 (Fig. 3),
whose recombinant regions 5’ and 3’ to the intra-species break-
point were similar in size to those of R12, but whose strains
comprising the intra-species breakpoint are only 4% divergent
on the nucleotide level. The ability of VIPR HMM to distinguish
between strains of the same species may also be inﬂuenced by the
size of the recombinant segment. The four other intra-species
breakpoints that VIPR HMM failed to detect had greater dis-
similarity between ﬂanking strains (25%) but were proximal to

VIPR HMM

 

associated with following a recombinant transition in the HMM,
our results suggest that Viterbi may opt to bypass small recom-
binant regions.

Although we have not speciﬁcally tested VIPR HMM for
higher order recombinants (more than three breakpoints), we
anticipate that the identiﬁcation of higher order recombinants
will only be hindered inasmuch as additional recombination
events within a fixed-size genome yield smaller recombinant seg-
ments to be identiﬁed. Given that VIPR HMM was shown to
identify recombinant regions as small as ~300 nt where there was
sufﬁcient divergence between recombining species, we expect
VIPR HMM would be able to detect similar regions in higher
order recombinants.

Since microarray probes are mapped to their position in an
alignment of candidate genomes, VIPR HMM can use the
probes located at the boundary of a predicted recombination
event to estimate nucleotide positions of recombination break-
points. Although it was not expected that using a microarray
tiling scheme wherein probes were non-overlapping and spaced
63 nt apart would give the precise nucleotide positions of recom-
bination breakpoints, we compared the estimates given by VIPR
HMM with the nucleotide positions known from sequence. For
the 61 correctly identiﬁed breakpoints (59 inter-species, 2
intra-species), the differences between microarray estimates and
actual positions ranged from 0 to 90 nt. Therefore, the maximum
distance observed falls within the span of about a two probe
tiling (i.e. 90< 60mer + 3 nt spacing+ 60mer). We expect that
using higher density tiling strategies would result in higher reso-
lution mapping of the breakpoints.

Only two false-positive recombination breakpoints were pre-
dicted by VIPR HMM, both near the 3’ ends of their respective
genomes. One bypassed the ﬁnal 254 nt of dengue Virus 4 in favor
of null states. The other bypassed the ﬁnal 191 nt of Sindbis Virus
in favor of VEEV states. From analysis of the training data, it
was observed that the mean of the On distributions approach the
mean of the Oﬂ distributions for probes near the 3’ end of each
genome, due to lower intensities for On probes in the training set
for that region. This trend was observed in the training data
universally for all genomes. The tendency for On probes to
give lower intensities when approaching the 3’ end may be at-
tributable to the fact that random PCR ampliﬁcation, which was
used in the preparation of each sample for hybridization, is less
efﬁcient at the ends of a linear genome. This could also explain
why VIPR failed to detect three inter-species recombination
breakpoints, all of which are localized near the 3’ end of a
genome. A similar pattern of lower intensities was also observed
for On probes approaching the 5’ end, although there appeared
to be more probes in those regions that behaved as expected
based on AG compared with the 3’ end. Despite the observed
decrease in hybridization intensity proximal to the 3’ and 5’ ter-
mini, VIPR HMM was still able to make accurate predictions in
those regions in most cases.

Although we did not speciﬁcally validate VIPR HMM for
reassortant Viruses, we anticipate that Viral reassortants would
be readily detected. Reassortment can occur during co-infection
when Virus progeny inherit genome segments from two or more
parental Viruses with multi-segmented genomes. The resulting
chimeric genotypes associated with reassortment are similar to
those generated through recombination except that the exchange

of genetic material occurs at discrete, predictable points in the
genome, i.e. at the boundary between genome segments. VIPR
HMM could also be applied to the analysis of bacterial genomes
and for the detection of the loss of transposons, integrons and
plasmids, assuming those elements are represented in members of
the training set.

One challenge in building an HMM for detecting recombin-
ation is ﬁnding an appropriate value for P(Rec0mb), a
user-inputted probability of recombination parameter used to
calculate different transition probabilities in the model. Our
choice of P(Rec0mb) was based on minimizing false-positive
recombinations in non-recombinant samples. If P(Rec0mb) is
increased by ﬁve logs, i.e. P(Rec0mb) 2 10‘”, the number of cor-
rectly called breakpoints is increased to from 59/62 to 60/62.
However, there are an additional three false-positive breakpoints
called near genome ends. Nonetheless, in some cases, it may be
advantageous to increase P(Rec0mb) in order to increase detec-
tion sensitivity. If P(Rec0mb) is decreased by ﬁve logs, i.e.
P(Rec0mb) 2 10‘”, there is no change in the results.

VIPR HMM relies on a multiple alignment of candidate gen-
omes to order microarray probes. One limitation of this ap-
proach is that only recombination between members of the
same family will be considered as candidates since it is not gen-
erally feasible to globally align members of different families. In
addition, because paths through the HMM follow a speciﬁc 5’73’
ordering, only recombination at homologous sites is detectible by
VIPR HMM as currently implemented. In future versions of
VIPR, recombinants composed of Viruses from different families
could be detected by running multiple iterations of Viterbi, one
for each HMM representing a different Virus family. For a hypo-
thetical recombinant between members of two different Virus
families, we anticipate that the HMM for each family would
predict the presence of only a portion of the Viral genome
from its family (with the rest of the prediction being the null
genome). With respect to selecting an appropriate P(Rec0mb)
for detecting inter-family recombination, there are several differ-
ent approaches that could be taken. One would be to use the
same P(Rec0mb) for inter-family events as is used for
intra-family events. Another would be to lower P(Rec0mb) for
inter-family events. The choice of strategy would likely depend
on what was known a priori about the possibility of certain
families recombining.

The time complexity for the VIPR HMM algorithm is n x m,
where n is the number of probes and m is the number of gen-
omes. The 22 alphavirus recombinant samples were analyzed in
under 30s on a single-processor PC with 4 GB RAM. Thus, if
the number of candidate genomes were increased to 1000 while
the number of probes remained the same, it would take ~150 s or
2.5 min to analyze one sample on a similar machine.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We developed an HMM to identify recombination in Viruses that
have been hybridized to a microbial detection microarray. This
model builds on previous work in which empirical hybridizations
of cultured Viruses were used as training to classify unknown
infections (VIPR). Applying the HMM in conjunction with
VIPR enabled the detection of inter-species recombination
breakpoints with high accuracy in two different families of

Viruses. This is the ﬁrst report of a method for analyzing diag-
nostic microarrays that includes recombination as a possible
diagnostic outcome. Our method is theoretically applicable to
detecting homologous recombination or reassortment between
members of any family of Viruses for which a set of non-
recombinant parental Viruses is available for training and for
which genome sequences are available. The inherently parallel
nature of diagnostic microarrays coupled with powerful methods
for analysis enhances our ability to rapidly and accurately iden-
tify novel recombinant Viruses responsible for disease outbreaks,
either due to emergence by natural means or by engineered re-
combinant Viruses.

5 MATERIALS AND METHODS

5.1 Design of the diagnostic microarray

60mer oligonucleotide probes were designed from sequences representing
three virus families (Bunyaviridae, Flaviridae and Togaviridae) using a
tiling strategy. 145 RefSeq genomes and genome segments from the afore-
mentioned virus families were obtained from Genbank. To the RefSeq
set, we added from Genbank as many complete genome sequences as
were available of the parental viruses of the 11 recombinant alphaviruses.
Partial genome sequences for the parental alphaviruses were added if
complete genomes were not available. Additionally, complete genome
sequences of alphaviruses that did not represent parents of the recombin-
ant viruses were added until there were in the set at least three complete
genomes of each of EEEV, VEEV, WEEV, Chikungunya and Sindbis
viruses. The ﬁnal set of Genbank records totaled 193, of which 175 were
complete or nearly complete genomes or genome segments. Probes were
selected as 60 nt windows tiled over all 193 sequences with a spacing of
three nucleotides between the 3’ end of one probe and the 5’ end of the
following probe. The reverse complement of each 60mer was also
included in the microarray. The resulting set of probes including reverse
complements totaled 43 414 and the Agilent® 4 x 44 K platform was used
(GEO accession GSE34490).

5.2 Hybridization of alphavirus and ﬂavivirus parental
and recombinant viruses to the diagnostic microarray

Twenty-one alphaviruses (11 recombinants+ 10 parental viruses) and 9
ﬂaviviruses (four recombinants+ ﬁve parental viruses) which have been
previously described (Atasheva et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2007; Paessler et al.,
2003, 2006; Wang et al., 2007, 2008) were obtained from the World
Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses and were
grown in Vero cells. RNA was extracted using standard Trizol® protocols
and was reverse transcribed and randomly ampliﬁed as previously
described (Wang et al., 2003). For each recombinant, two independent
ampliﬁcations were performed, while ﬁve independent ampliﬁcations
were performed for each parental virus. The resulting ampliﬁed material
was then coupled to a ﬂuorescent dye and hybridized to the tiling micro-
array. Raw data measurements were collected using GenePix Pro® soft-
ware. In total, 114 hybridizations were performed (30 recombinant+ 75
parental + 9 uninfected Vero cells). All raw microarray data are available
in NCBI GEO (accession GSE34490). The training set for our HMM
consisted of 60 parental hybridizations + 5 Vero negative control hybrid-
izations, while the test set for validating the algorithm consisted of the 30
recombinant hybridizations + 15 parental hybridizations+ 4 Vero nega-
tive control hybridizations.

5.3 Viterbi algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal path

By multiplying emission probabilities e(state, intensity) and transition
probabilities t(state, state) across a series of states, it is possible to

obtain a probability for an entire path through an HMM. For our
HMM, the set of emission and transition parameters is abbreviated as
6. The probability of a particular path (Jr) and a given hybridization (x) of
length L can be expressed as a joint probability:

The Viterbi algorithm falls into a class of algorithms called dynamic
programming algorithms that are commonly used in conjunction with
HMMs. Using the Viterbi algorithm allows us to identify the most prob-
able series of states (21’) through our HMM where

TI" 2 argmaan(x, JTIHMM, 6)

Points of recombination can be inferred from places in the path where
a transition between states of different genomes has occurred. As with
other dynamic programming algorithms, the Viterbi algorithm consists of
an initialization step, an iteration step and a termination step. Once the
dynamic programming matrix (V) is populated, the optimal path is traced
back through a shadow matrix (1:) of stored pointers. Except for the begin
and end states shag,“ and send and states in a given path (21,-), all other states
(sgyi) are indexed by genome (g) and probe (1'). The V matrix and 1: matrix
are similarly indexed. Calculations are performed in log space although
they are shown here in probability space. The Viterbi algorithm adapted
from Durbin (1998) is as follows:

(1) Initialization (g=1 to n)
Vg, 1 = [(Sbcgin, Sg, 1)e(sg, 1, X1)
(2) Iteration (i = 2 to L; g: 1 to n)

Vg,i = €(Sg,i, Xi)maX;-l:1 i71t(Sj,i71aSg,i)]

1g“- : argrnaxj';1  H t(sj, H , sg, ,-)]
(3) Termination

P(x, J'r’ |HMM, 9) = max]:1  Lt(sj, L, Sumo]

J'r’L = argrnaxj';1  Lt(sj, L, smug]

(4) Traceback (i = L to 2)

77:21 = ﬁnial.)

Traceback reveals the optimal path through the HMM. If the path
includes states representing only one genome, the optimal path is a
non-recombinant path. If the optimal path includes transitions between
states of different genomes, the path is recombinant, and the global align-
ment positions corresponding to the probes associated with the states
involved in each transition are referenced. These global alignment pos-
itions are then back-converted to genomic positions in the predicted virus
parents in order to deﬁne the recombinant breakpoints between virus
genomes on the nucleotide level.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The central proteomics facilities pipeline (CPFP) provides
identification, validation, and quantitation of peptides and proteins
from LC-MS/MS datasets through an easy to use web interface.
It is the first analysis pipeline targeted specifically at the needs of
proteomics core facilities, reducing the data analysis load on staff,
and allowing facility clients to easily access and work with their
data. Identification of peptides is performed using multiple search
engines, their output combined and validated using state-of-the-art
techniques for improved results. Cluster execution of jobs allows
analysis capacity to be increased easily as demand grows.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as the dominant technique
for the identiﬁcation and quantitation of peptides and proteins from
complex mixtures. A large number of institutions have established
core proteomics facilities to provide MS services, sharing equipment
and expertise with a wide range of users (Ogorzalek-Loo et (11.,
2009). With the growth in demand for high-throughput LC-MS/MS
analysis of complex samples, and increased interest in quantitative
proteomics, effective analysis of data can be challenging. Existing
freely available pipelines such as TPP (Keller et (11., 2005), CPAS
(Labkey Software Foundation), OpenMS/T OPP (Kohlbacher et (11.,
2007), SwissPIT (Quandt et (11., 2008) and MASSPECTRAS
(Hartler et (11., 2007) support a variety of proteomics search
engines and validation tools, but often require users to understand
the various parameter formats of the search engines, reconcile
differences in post-translational modiﬁcation (PTM) speciﬁcations
and manually run multiple searches if more than one search engine
is to be used. Commercial applications such as Scaffold (Proteome
Software, Portland OR, USA), PEAKS (Bioinformatics Solutions
Inc., Waterloo ON, Canada) and Sorcerer (Sage-N Research,
Milpitas CA, USA) provide user-friendly interfaces but require
signiﬁcant outlay if multiple licences are required. The central
proteomics facilities pipeline (CPFP) aims to provide a simple

interface for core facility staff and clients, and to fully automate
the analysis of MS/MS data with multiple search engines.

2 FEATURES

CPFP accepts datasets of LC-MS/MS spectra in szML, szL,
pkl and mgf formats. Files of unlimited size can be uploaded
for analysis via a web browser. Identiﬁcation of peptides from
spectra is performed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK),
OMSSA (Geer et (11., 2004) and XITANDEM (Craig and Beavis,
2004). XITANDEM searches may be performed using the native
or k-score algorithms (Maclean et (11., 2006). A single web form
allows submission to all search engines using common parameters.
Translation of parameters into the formats required by the individual
search engines is performed automatically. PTM deﬁnitions may be
imported from Unimod (Creasy and Cottrell, 2004) for use with all
search engines.

Validation of results is performed using the TPP analysis tools.
Peptide identiﬁcations from each search engine are validated with
PeptideProphet (Keller et (11., 2002), and then combined using
iProphet (Shteynberg et (11., 2008). Finally, protein identiﬁcations
are inferred using ProteinProphet (Nezvizhskii et (11., 2003).
Quantitation can be performed using LIBRA for iTRAQ-labelled
samples, and ASAPRatio (Li et (11., 2003) for heavy isotope-
labelled samples. All searches are performed against concatenated
target/decoy sequence databases. Results can be viewed at
the l and 5% false discovery rates (FDRs) as calculated by
Peptide/ProteinProphet or estimated empirically from decoy hits
(Elias and Gygi, 2007). External ﬁinctionality such as BLAST
searches against identiﬁed peptides, and submission of spectra for
spectral search against public datasets, is inherited through the use
of the TPP PerML and ProtXML viewers. Graphs indicating the
quality of results can be viewed for each search, and users may
download result ﬁles for further analysis with additional software.

Submission and search details are recorded in a database. User
authentication can be integrated with existing systems. Users who
submit data may grant others access to View their results. A basic
administrative interface is provided to conﬁgure sequence databases
and quantitation methods based on ASAPRatio.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

CPFP consists of a web application, relational database and
collection of pipeline scripts. It is written in Perl using the
Catalyst Web Framework and is intended for installation on recent

Linux systems. GridEngine (Sun Microsystems) is used to provide
job scheduling across a cluster, allowing computing infrastructure
to be scaled as demand increases. Mascot searches are submitted
via HTTP, allowing the use of a Mascot server that is not part of
the cluster. The pipeline may be used without Mascot if it is not
available.

4 RESULTS

The DLD-LTQ and Serum-Orbi datasets described in Ma et (11.
(2009) were analysed using CPFP. Searches used the IPI-Human
sequence database v3.64 (Kersey et (11., 2004) and the parameters
given in Ma et (11. (2009). Results were ﬁltered to an estimated 1%
FDR using the target—decoy procedure. Figure 1 shows the number
of identiﬁcations for Mascot, XITANDEM k-score and OMSSA
searches processed separately, and a combined result merged using
iProphet. Combining the results of the three search engines gives a
higher number of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) and unique
peptide identiﬁcations versus the best performing single search
engine (OMSSA in both cases). The increase in PSMs is 6.6 and
14.4% for the DLDl-LTQ and Serum-Orbi datasets, respectively.
Submission to and combination of results from all search engines
is automated, and required no additional steps for the user versus
the use of a single search engine. Timings for the Serum-Orbi
dataset on a 32-core cluster were 9 min 47 s for Mascot, 7 min 31 s
for XITANDEM and 11 min 50 s for OMSSA individually, versus
16min 45 s for all searches in parallel, followed by combination of
results.

5 FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

CPFP is in daily use and under active development. The application
has been released under an open source licence so that it may be
used and adapted by other groups. Work is ongoing to incorporate

export of results to PRIDE XML format (Jones et (11., 2006) and
allow integration with a local PRIDE repository. Scripts for the
generation of inclusion and exclusion lists will be incorporated into
the pipeline, reducing the effort necessary to use multi-injection
MS workﬂows to increase sample coverage. PTM identiﬁcation
and validation is a priority, which will involve the incorporation of
non-TPP analysis tools and alternative workﬂows, similar to those
previously implemented in SwissPIT. A desktop Java client for bulk
submission of data is under development.

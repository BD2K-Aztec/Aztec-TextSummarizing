Abstract

Summary: NucleusJ is a simple and user—friendly ImageJ plugin dedicated to the characterization
of nuclear morphology and chromatin organization in 3D. Starting from image stacks, the nuclear
boundary is delimited by combining the Otsu segmentation method with optimization of nuclear
sphericity. Chromatin domains are segmented by partitioning the nucleus using a 3D watershed
algorithm and by thresholding a contrast measure over the resulting regions. As output, NucleusJ
quantifies 15 parameters including shape and size of nuclei as well as intra—nuclear objects and
their position within the nucleus. A step—by—step documentation is available for self—training, to—
gether with data sets of nuclei with different nuclear organization.

Availability and implementation: Dataset of nuclei is available at https://www.gred—clermont.fr/
media/WorkDirectory.zip. NucleusJ is available at http://imagejdocu.tudor.|u/doku.php?id=p|ugin:

1 Introduction

The nucleus is a compartmentalized organelle containing distinct
chromosomal domains and a variety of nuclear bodies.
Organization and positioning of chromatin domains within the
nuclear space, such as clusters of heterochromatin termed
chromocentres (Fransz et (11., 2002), impact gene expression
(Bickmore and van Steensel, 2013). To link nuclear structure and
function, imaging tools that quantify nuclear morphology, position—
ing and organization of chromatin domains in three dimensions
(3D) are needed. Although proprietary softvvares or open source
programs such as NEMO and TANGO are available (Iannuccelli
et (11., 2010; Ollion et (11., 2013), they either require financial invest—
ment or minimal knowledge of image processing algorithms. Our
Nucleus] plugin assembles a complete set of methods in a coherent
strategy, quantifies 15 different nuclear and chromatin parameters
and does not require expertise in image analysis.

2 Methods

The Nucleus] plugin processes 3D images of nuclei either acquired
by live imaging with ﬂuorescent reporters, from fixed tissues or iso—
lated nuclei stained with DNA dyes. Nucleus] uses the MorphoLib]
library (https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ) available for Image]
and Fiji. The implemented 3D image processing and analysis pipe—
line can be run either completely or partially, on single images or in
batch mode, thus offering ﬂexibility to accommodate the diversity
of practical needs and application purposes (Fig. 1). In the course of
the analysis, transformed images are generated, automatically
organized in sub—directories, and results of quantitative analyses are
arranged in four output files (Fig. 1).

Segmentation is an essential procedure in image analysis as it sep—
arates objects from each other and from the background. Nucleus]
includes two segmentation steps that extract first the nucleus and
then chromatin domains such as chromocentres. 3D nucleus

Fig. 1. NucleusJ combines tools that can be run in single or batch mode and
along different scenarios (1—4). Raw images are stored in A by the user.
Transformed images are automatically organized in directories (B—D) and
quantitative parameters exported as output files (l—IV). Nucleus
Segmentation (1) and Nucleus Segmentation and Analysis (2) produce seg-
mented images automatically stored in B. Quantitative parameters are ex-
ported as files | and 11 only when (2) is chosen. Chromocentre Segmentation
(3) applies the 3D watershed transformation to raw images in A using seg-
mented nuclei stored in B. Contrast images are then stored in C.
Chromocentres are defined by manual thresholding and images stored in D.
Chromocentre parameters are computed by Chromocentre analysis (4) and
exported as file 111. Finally, a compilation of all parameters is exported as file
IV. Images of Arabidopsis nuclei were acquired with a structured illumination
microscope (Leica microsystems) using a water><63 objective. Resolution:
xy: 0.103 um and 2: 0.200 um. Scale bar: 2 pm

segmentation is performed using an adaptation of the Otsu thresh—
olding method (Otsu, 1979), here combined with optimization of a
shape parameter called sphericity (3671 >< volumeZ/surface area3). The
threshold value provided by the standard Otsu method is used as a
starting point to test a range of thresholds, which eventually leads to
the selection of the value for which the sphericity is maximal (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Fig. S1 and S2). Chromocentre segmentation is
performed using the segmented nucleus image as mask. We imple—
mented the watershed immersion algorithm (Vincent and Soille,
1991) in 3D to partition the nucleus mask into a number of regions.
To overcome the low contrast between chromocentres and the back—
ground intensity of the nucleus, the resulting image is analysed to cre—
ate a map of intensity contrasts between neighbouring regions
(Andrey et (11., 2010). Because semi—automatic or manual approaches
are more accurate than fully automatic procedures, we kept the final
thresholding of the intensity contrast to obtain the segmented image
of chromocentres as a manual step.

3 Results

Following segmentation, a morphometric analysis is applied to meas—
ure nuclear volume and 3D shape descriptors (ﬂatness, elongation
and sphericity). Nucleus] also computes chromatin organization par—
ameters such as number, total volume and intensity of chromocentres
relative to the entire nucleus (Tessadori et (11., 2007) as well as indi—
vidual chromocentre parameters including volume and distance to
the nuclear periphery. Overall, the nucleus is characterized by 15
quantitative parameters (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1), which
are automatically saved as output files for further statistical analysis.
Nucleus] was validated using an Arabidopsis mutant line lacking
CROWDED NUCLEI (CRWN) proteins, which are putative compo—
nents of the plant nucleoskeleton (Wang et (11., 2013). Analysis of a
small set of 38 (wild type) and 39 (crqu crquZ mutant) nuclei re—
vealed reduced nuclear volume, increased sphericity and fewer
chromocentres of increased size in the mutant compared with WT, in
perfect agreement with Wang et al. (2013; Fig. 2).

epidermis pavement cell nuclei of wild type (wt, left) and mutant (crwn1

tive data: nucleus in grey is surrounded by the nuclear envelope (NE) in dark
gray, chromocentres (Cc) in white. (B) Principal component analysis using the
15 parameters on wt (black) and crwn1 crwn2 (red) nuclei. (C) Statistical ana-
lysis of four selected parameters (***P< 0.0001)

The analysis of the 77 nuclei took about 1 h. The time—limiting
step is the manual thresholding of contrast images for chromocentre
segmentation, since it involves visual crosschecking with raw images
(Fig. 1 ). The statistical analysis of the data validates our method and
opens avenues to phenotype nuclei in other Arabidopsis mutants, as
well as in different cell types of other organisms.

4 Conclusion

Computational image analysis provides precise, objective and repro—
ducible quantitative data from images. Our plugin generates, within
a few steps, 3D quantitative measurements from single images or
large data sets, without requiring expertise in image analysis.
Nuclear domains visible with DNA dyes, such as chromocentres, are
not specific to plants. Nucleus] will, therefore, be useful for a large
community of users interested in quantifying size and shape of nu—
clei, nuclear objects or chromatin domains as well as positioning of
the latter in nuclear space. In the future, we expect to improve our
segmentation methods, to extend Nucleus] to quantify ﬂuorescent
in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunochemistry signals and to de—
fine a new method to automatically segment chromocentres.

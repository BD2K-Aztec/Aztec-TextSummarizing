Abstract

Motivation: Recent efforts to manipulate various microbial communities, such as fecal microbiota
transplant and bioreactor systems’ optimization, suggest a promising route for microbial commu—
nity engineering with numerous medical, environmental and industrial applications. However,
such applications are currently restricted in scale and often rely on mimicking or enhancing natural
communities, calling for the development of tools for designing synthetic communities with spe—
cific, tailored, desired metabolic capacities.

Results: Here, we present a first step toward this goal, introducing a novel algorithm for identifying
minimal sets of microbial species that collectively provide the enzymatic capacity required to syn—
thesize a set of desired target product metabolites from a predefined set of available substrates.
Our method integrates a graph theoretic representation of network flow with the set cover problem
in an integer linear programming (ILP) framework to simultaneously identify possible metabolic
paths from substrates to products while minimizing the number of species required to catalyze
these metabolic reactions. We apply our algorithm to successfully identify minimal communities
both in a set of simple toy problems and in more complex, realistic settings, and to investigate
metabolic capacities in the gut microbiome. Our framework adds to the growing toolset for sup—
porting informed microbial community engineering and for ultimately realizing the full potential of
such engineering efforts.

1 Introduction

 

Complex microbial communities can be found everywhere on our
planet, spanning marine communities inhabiting the deep ocean to
symbiotic communities living on and within host organisms. These
communities impact a broad set of processes ranging from environ-
mental resource cycles to host organism health. For example, deep
sea rock and vent communities play a fundamental role in oxidizing
environmental methane (Marlow et (11., 2014), whereas the human
gut microbiome crucially aids in drug metabolism, energy harvest

and immune system response (Sekirov et (11., 2010). Microbial com-
munities affect these processes through a variety of metabolic reac-
tions catalyzed by enzymes encoded in the member species’
genomes, and ultimately through the diverse compounds each com-
munity can degrade or produce.

These critical roles microbial communities play in shaping their
environment, combined with the potential to manipulate these com-
munities, suggest a promising route for numerous medical and envir-
onmental applications (Brenner et (11., 2008). Specifically, several

such efforts to shift target communities toward preferred states have
used samples from naturally occurring communities as an inocula—
tion source. For instance, transplanting healthy donor microbiome
samples into patient guts has recently been used to treat a variety of
gut disorders (Aroniadis and Brandt, 2013). Such fecal microbiota
transplants (FMTs) have been shown to perturb a patient’s dysbiotic
gut community, shifting it to a healthier state and ameliorating their
condition (Hamilton et al., 2013; Song et al., 2013). These FMT—
based therapies have had a >90% success rate at curing recurrent
Clostridium difficile infections and have promising results for ad—
dressing other gut disorders including inflammatory bowel disease
and metabolic syndrome (Rossen et al., 2015). Similarly, wastewater
treatment bioreactors are often seeded by microbial communities
cultivated from naturally occurring wastewater microbes or from
previously established bioreactors (Alleman and Prakasam, 1983).
These seed communities colonize the new bioreactor and thereby
provide the metabolic processes necessary to degrade biological mat—
ter in wastewater.

Following the success of such transplants, recent efforts have fur—
ther aimed to use engineered, rather than naturally occurring, com—
munities in an attempt to increase control over transplant outcomes.
For example, a synthetic stool substitute was recently developed
using a mixture of cultured bacterial isolates to mimic a healthy gut
community (Petrof et al., 2013). Such a synthetic community re—
moves the need for sample donors, allows greater regulation over
the bacteria present in the transplant community, and reduces the
risk for inadvertent transfer of pathogens. This synthetic and mark—
edly simpler community was shown to still be effective in treating
C. difficile infections. Another effort applied a simple selection—
based approach to optimize the species composition of a bioreactor
seed community for increased biopolymer production from glycerol
(Moralejo-Garate et al., 2011). The final community’s biopolymer
production rate was demonstrated to be noticeably increased com—
pared to the original community.

Such community engineering approaches are clearly an import—
ant first step towards customizing microbial community compos—
ition, yet they still largely rely on imitating natural community
structures or enhancing existing community capabilities and cannot,
for example, produce communities with potentially desired abilities
absent from the initial community. Indeed, even optimizing an exist—
ing community function involves developing a carefully controlled
selection procedure tailored to the preferred function and may re—
quire a long time for the community to reach an optimal state. The
applications of such engineering efforts are therefore inherently con—
strained and are often very system—specific and hard to generalize.

One approach to address these challenges is to rationally design
and construct synthetic communities with desired and predefined
metabolic capabilities. Such a design process would involve the care—
ful selection of member species and their abundances, hopefully
defining a community composition that would achieve the desired
metabolic task in the target environment. The ability to design such
communities would significantly broaden the applicability of com—
munity engineering, could alleviate the reliance on naturally occur—
ring community functions, and would ultimately support the
construction of communities tailored to perform specific tasks
within the context of various environmental settings.

Designing microbial communities, however, is a daunting task.
Microbial species are endowed with tremendously diverse and com—
plex capacities, which may not be trivial or easy to discern.
Moreover, the various species comprising each community do not
function independently, and each community impacts its environ—
ment through the orchestrated activity of its members. Interaction

between species can lead to emergent behaviors that cannot be
attributed to the function of just a single species or to additive spe—
cies functions (Pelz et al., 1999; Pettit, 2009). One species can, for
example, provide the necessary precursors that allow a second spe—
cies to produce metabolites that it could not produce when growing
in isolation (Chiu et al., 2014). Similarly, costly metabolic tasks
could be distributed among community members such that each
member performs a specific part of a complex metabolic pathway
(Moran, 2007). A successful design framework should therefore ac—
count for such interactions and their impact on the metabolism of
the community as a whole.

As a first step to address this challenge, here we develop
CoMiDA (@mmunity Metabolism Qesign Algorithm), an algo—
rithmic framework for designing simple communities with some
predefined metabolic capacities. Specifically, we aim to identify a
set of species that, as a community, have the metabolic potential to
convert a set of metabolic substrates to a set of desired target me—
tabolites. We further aim to discern the smallest set of species
required to provide this desired metabolic potential, reducing
downstream complexities and providing more streamlined com—
munities. In other words, our goal is to identify a minimal set of
species whose genomes collectively encode a set of enzymatic genes
that can catalyze a collection of metabolic reactions forming meta—
bolic paths to each desired product metabolite from the available
substrates.

Communities designed with our framework will therefore have
the required metabolic potential to achieve the specified metabolism.
Obviously, there are additional factors and processes that should be
ultimately considered in designing a stable and functional commu—
nity that carries out a specific task. First and foremost, possessing
the set of reactions leading from substrates to products does not ne—
cessarily imply that the community would actively and efficiently
perform the desired metabolic function. Toxin production, signaling
between microbes, the capacity to transport metabolites between
cells, and the ability of the selected species to survive in the target
environment could further affect the community behavior, stability
and dynamics. Yet, having the metabolic potential to carry out the
desired function is an important and essential prerequisite for any
community that could achieve the specified task, and is therefore a
natural first step in rational community design and a critical compo—
nent of any design task (see also Section 4).

2 Methods

2.1 Problem statement and approach

The goal of our design task is, given a set of substrate metabolites
and a set of target product metabolites, to find a minimal subset of
the available species that can collectively synthesize this set of target
products using the available substrates. Specifically, here we view
each microbial species as a simple assemblage of metabolic reac—
tions, corresponding to the set of enzymatic genes encoded in its
genome. Each reaction is represented as a hyperedge, linking the re—
action’s substrates to the reaction’s products. We further initially as—
sume that metabolites can transfer freely between species, a
common simplifying assumption in various community models
(Gordon and Klaenhammer, 2011; Raymond and Segre, 2006; Song
et al., 2014; Taffs et al., 2009), though we relax this assumption
later. The metabolic potential of each community can accordingly
be viewed as the aggregate set of metabolic reactions of the member
species. A solution to our design task is therefore a minimal set of
species that collectively include some set of metabolic reactions

uptake and secretion. Such a compartmentalized problem can in fact
be solved by the algorithm as currently defined simply by modifying
the sets of metabolites and reactions. Specifically, rather than having
a single variable to denote each metabolite (regardless of its com—
partment), a set of variables should be defined to denote the metab—
olite in each compartment in which it exists (be it a specific species
or the shared environment). Given this extended set of metabolite
variables, metabolic reactions are now viewed as operating within a
species (and accordingly connect species—specific substrates to spe—
cies—specific products). An additional set of transport reactions
(which correspond to each species” uptake and secretion capacities)
can then convert species—specific metabolites to environmental me—
tabolites and vice—versa. In this compartmentalized setting, one spe—
cies can only use metabolites produced by another species if both
species have the appropriate transport reactions. For example, for a
given metabolite in to transfer from species A to species B, species A
must include a transport reaction to convert the A—specific version
of m to an environmental version, and similarly species B must in—
clude a transport reaction to convert the environmental version of m
to a B—specific version.

More formally, we now define M:{m0’1, mo’z, .. ., m0)", mu,
. . ., mqm} as the set of metabolites such that map where i 6 {0,1,. . .,q}
and k 6 {1,2,. . .,n} denotes metabolite k in species 1'. We interpret
the 0th species as the shared environment. We then replace each re—
action, r,, present in species I in our previous formulation with a
new reaction:

7i.) : ({mi.j,substrate,17mi.j,substrate,27 - - - 7mi.j,substrate,d}7

{mi.j_product_17mi.j_product_27 - - - 7mi.j_product_e 

Each species may also include a set of transport reactions that
convert environmental metabolites to species—specific metabolites
(reflecting uptake reactions):

ri.transport_l : ("10.127 mi.k)7

or species—specific metabolites to environmental metabolites (repre—
senting secretion):

ri.transportJ : (mikv "10.12)-

Together, these new metabolite and reaction definitions relax
the assumption of freely transferred metabolites and allow our algo—
rithm to solve problems in a compartmentalized species setting.

2.7 Forcing substrate usage and incorporating

species costs

The above ILP—based formulation can be further extended to force
the obtained solution to meet additional requirements or to consider
additional factors. Specifically, we have developed and implemented
algorithm extensions to handle two biologically relevant consider—
ations, the first forcing the solution to utilize (or degrade) specified
substrates, and the second to weigh species” predefined desirability
when constructing a community. For a detailed description of the
associated constraints and modifications, see Supplementary Text 1.

3 Results

3.1 Algorithm implementation and availability

We implemented the algorithm outlined above as a C ++ program
which takes as input a file describing the various parameters of the
design task, including available substrates, target products and the

set of available species with their associated metabolic reactions.
The program then generates the associated ILP instance in the
Mathematical Programming System (MPS) format (default) or the
CPLEX format (depending on the requirements of the ILP solver
used). The source code for the algorithm is available under a non—
commercial research use only license at https://github.com/boren
stein—lab/CoMiDA. To obtain solutions for our test cases and data—
set analysis, we used the COIN—OR Branch and Cut (CBC) solver
(Lougee-Heimer, 2003).

3.2 Unit test validation

We first aimed to verify our algorithm using a set of simple design
problems. Specifically, we generated a suite of toy problems as unit
test cases for our algorithm. These toy problems test whether our al—
gorithm identifies an optimal solution under different scenarios that
cover a variety of edge cases. These test cases focus on simple design
tasks, with up to five species and up to seven associated metabolic
reactions. For example, some cases examined scenarios in which the
minimal species solution requires a longer metabolic path from sub—
strate to product than a non—minimal species solution. Other cases
examined scenarios in which a solution does not exist (e.g. because
no path exists from substrate to product, regardless of which species
are used). We have applied our algorithm to each of these test cases
and confirmed that our algorithm correctly produces the ILP formu—
lation and ultimately identifies an optimal solution for each design
task (or the absence of one). These toy problems, along with their
expected ILP formulations, can be found (with the source code) at
https://github.com/borenstein—lab/CoMiDA, providing users with
simple examples of the expected input/output format and allowing
users to confirm that the algorithm is working properly.

3.3 Glycolysis pathway validation

The toy problems described above are limited in size and may not be
comparable in scale to many real—world scenarios. To examine our
algorithm’s performance on datasets of a more practical size, we
next focused on a well—characterized metabolic pathway, the
Embden—Meyerhof glycolysis pathway (KEGG entry M00001
(Kanehisa et al., 2014; Ogata et al., 1999)), defining glucose and
pyruvate as the available substrate and target product respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 51). For the set of available species, we selected
all 284 species identified from the 2013 Human Microbiome Project
(HMP) (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012a) stool sam—
ple datasets that contained the entire set of metabolic reactions in
the glycolysis pathway as predicted by PICRUSt (Langille et al.,
2013). Combined, this set of species corresponds to an aggregate
metabolic network containing 1803 metabolites and 3120 metabolic
reactions. Since each species in this set can catalyze the entire path—
way from glucose to pyruvate, our algorithm identifies, as expected,
a single species solution (one of the 284 possible choices). To test
our algorithm’s performance when minimal solutions required mul—
tiple species, we next therefore modified the metabolic network of
each species, deleting various reactions and forcing a multi—species
solution. Specifically, we first removed all alternate reaction paths
between glucose and pyruvate by removing the first reaction in each
alternate path that was not also part of the glycolysis pathway
(Supplementary Fig. 51), filtering out 39 reactions and leaving a
total of 3081 metabolic reactions in the aggregate network. We then
removed selected reactions in the glycolysis pathway from subsets of
the available species such that no single species contained all reac—
tions in the path (e.g. by removing one reaction in the pathway from
half of the available species and a different reaction from the other

provides a starting point for such design efforts and for future
method development in this area. Specifically, selecting a commu—
nity based initially on the presence of desired metabolic capacities
provides a simple way to address an important prerequisite for com—
munity metabolism; any community designed to consume or pro—
duce given metabolites or to have some metabolic activity must
obviously also have the metabolic capacity to carry out those func—
tions. Our attempt to identify minimal communities may again not
necessarily be aligned with biological assembly rules, but offers sim—
ple candidate communities for further design refinement. Moreover,
by formulating our program as an ILP algorithm, we provide an
easy way to introduce additional design considerations. As our
understanding of the various constraints affecting community as—
sembly improves, such considerations can be added to this frame—
work by devising equations and inequalities that encode these
constraints.

Of the various considerations that could be implemented to fur—
ther refine any design approach, two stand out as logical next
steps. First, the expected stability of designed communities could
be improved by examining the likelihood that a combination of
species will coexist in a community. Specifically, information on
species co—occurrence in natural communities can be used to esti—
mate the tendency of various species pairs to co—exist or the ex—
clude one another from a shared environment (Faust et al., 2012;
Levy and Borenstein, 2013). Such information would allow an al—
gorithm to prioritize communities that minimize the risk of losing
member species due to antagonistic species interactions, ultimately
stabilizing community structure. Second, considering the predicted
activity of candidate communities, rather than just the presence of
specific metabolic capacities, could increase the likelihood that de—
signed communities would perform the desired task. Several frame—
works for predicting the metabolic activity of microbial
communities have recently been introduced (Chiu et al., 2014;
Hareomb et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2011; Zomorrodi et al.,
2014), potentially allowing future design algorithms to consider
predicted rates of metabolite consumption and production and pre—
dicted changes in species abundances over time. Our algorithm
could be used, for example, as an initial filtering step, providing a
set of candidate minimal communities that have the capacity for
some desired metabolism, followed by a metabolic model—based
prediction of the metabolic activity of each candidate community
to further refine the design process. Moreover, such metabolic
modeling could allow the design process to account for important
factors that our current algorithm may not be able consider. For in—
stance, our algorithm does not explicitly prevent community mem—
bers from degrading one or more of the specified target products.
Such inadvertent target metabolite degradation may depend on the
set of microbes present, other available substrates, and various en—
vironmental conditions, and could therefore be predicted and p0—
tentially avoided using metabolic modeling—based design.

The ability to computationally design microbial communities
will be a useful tool for many purposes. For example, designed syn—
thetic communities could be ultimately used in place of FMTs,
removing the need for screening donor samples while also optimiz—
ing treatments to target specific conditions. Communities could also
be created for industrial resource and pharmaceutical production,
potentially obviating the need for extensive microbial genetic engin—
eering and providing novel mechanisms for production control in
the form of inter—species signaling (Brenner et al., 2008). Clearly,
such applications are not yet feasible and the development of a com—
prehensive, general—purpose design framework may still be out of
our reach for years to come. We hope, however, that our framework

will encourage future developments of such design methodologies
and will lay the foundation for future efforts in microbial commu—
nity design.

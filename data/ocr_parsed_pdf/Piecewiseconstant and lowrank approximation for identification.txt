ABSTRACT

Motivation: The post-genome era sees urgent need for more novel
approaches to extracting useful information from the huge amount of
genetic data. The identification of recurrent copy number variations
(CNVs) from array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
data can help understand complex diseases, such as cancer. Most
of the previous computational methods focused on single-sample
analysis or statistical testing based on the results of single-sample
analysis. Finding recurrent CNVs from multi-sample data remains a
challenging topic worth further study.

Results: We present a general and robust method to identify recur-
rent CNVs from multi-sample aCGH profiles. We express the raw
dataset as a matrix and demonstrate that recurrent CNVs will form a
low-rank matrix. Hence, we formulate the problem as a matrix re-
covering problem, where we aim to find a piecewise-constant and
low-rank approximation (PLA) to the input matrix. We propose a
convex formulation for matrix recovery and an efficient algorithm to
globally solve the problem. We demonstrate the advantages of PLA
compared with alternative methods using synthesized datasets and
two breast cancer datasets. The experimental results show that PLA
can successfully reconstruct the recurrent CNV patterns from raw data
and achieve better performance compared with alternative methods
under a wide range of scenarios.

1 INTRODUCTION

Copy number variations (CNVs) are genomic alterations char-
acterized as abnormal number of copies in one or more segments
of DNA. The size of segments varies from lkb to 3 Mb
(Hastings et al., 2009). Studies have indicated that CNVs are
associated with human diseases. For instance, Gonzalez et a].
(2005) found that individuals who carried fewer copies of gene
CCL3Ll than average were significantly more susceptible to
HIV. Each missing copy increases the susceptibility by 4.}
10.5%. Several other types of human diseases, such as cancers
and autoimmune diseases, have also been linked with CNVs (Lee
and Lupski, 2006; Lee et al., 2007; Lupski, 2007). Therefore, it is

important to investigate the contribution of CNV to complex
diseases.

Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is
a high-throughput and high-resolution approach for measuring
changes of copy numbers in thousands of DNA regions (Pinkel
and Albertson, 2005). In a typical aCGH experiment, genomic
DNAs are extracted from test samples and reference samples and
differentially labeled with two dyes. The labeled DNAs are mixed
together and hybridized to a microarray spotted with DNA
probes. The ratio between the ﬂuorescence intensity of the test
DNA and that of the reference DNA at a given probe measures
the ratio between the copy number in the test genome and that in
the reference genome. Data extracted from an aCGH experiment
are generally in the form of log; ratios. A value greater than zero
indicates a possible gain in the copy number, while a value less
than zero indicates a possible loss.

Detection of CNVs from aCGH data is to locate change-
points in logz-ratio proﬁles that partition each chromosome
into discrete segments. Because of the high noise level in the
intensity values of aCGH data, it is difficult to identify the
boundaries of CNVs using the typical thresholding approach
(Pinkel and Albertson, 2005). Many methods have been de-
veloped to analyze single-sample aCGH data, including break-
point detection (Olshen et al., 2004; Picard et al., 2005; Rancoita
et al., 2009), signal smoothing (Ben-Yaacov and Eldar, 2008;
Hupe et al., 2004; Tibshirani and Wang, 2008) and Hidden
Markov Models (Marioni et al., 2006; Stjernqvist et al., 2007).
Reviews and comparisons can be found in Lai et a]. (2005) and
Willenbrock and Fridlyand (2005). However, ﬁnding CNVs
from single samples is only the initial step in the search of dis-
ease-associated genes. It has been pointed out that the recurrent
CNVs (CNVs at the same genomic locations appearing fre-
quently over multiple individuals) are more likely to encompass
disease-critical genes (Beroukhim et al., 2007; Rueda and Diaz-
Uriarte, 2010).

Recently, an increasing number of methods have become
available for ﬁnding recurrent CNV regions from aCGH data
of multiple samples. A recurrent CNV region is often defined as
a set of consecutive probes that are altered in a group of samples
(Rueda and Diaz-Uriarte, 2010). Some methods identify recur-
rent CNV regions Via hypothesis testing by comparing the fre-
quency of alternations at each probe with a null distribution.
Examples include Beroukhim et a]. (2007), Diskin et al. (2006),
Guttman et a]. (2007). These methods rely on the preprocessing

of single-sample proﬁles, including smoothing, segmentation and
CNV calling, which may miss some weak but common variations
(Shah et al., 2007). Some other methods attempt to detect
recurrent CNV regions directly from raw proﬁles through
multiple-chain Hidden Markov Models (Shah et al., 2007),
joint segmentation (Picard et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2010a, b)
and matrix factorization methods (Nowak et al., 2011; Zhou
et al., 2013). Most of these methods assume a generative model
that describes the characteristics of recurrent variations and ﬁt
the model under the assumption of Gaussian noise. However,
these methods rarely consider the inﬂuence of individual-speciﬁc
variations, which typically have large intensity values and cannot
be modeled as Gaussian noise. As a result, individual-specific
variations will be mixed with recurrent variations and eventually
corrupt the model fitting.

In this article, we develop a robust and efﬁcient method to
identify recurrent CNVs from raw aCGH proﬁles. The main
contributions are summarized as follows:

0 We formulate the problem as a matrix decomposition prob-
lem, where the raw data matrix is decomposed into a
low-rank component, a sparse component and a noise com-
ponent. These three components correspond to recurrent
CNVs, individual-specific variations and random noises,
respectively. The recurrent CNVs can be easily identiﬁed
from the low-rank component by thresholding or more
sophisticated statistical analysis.

0 The proposed formulation is convex. An efficient and scal-
able algorithm is developed to ﬁnd the globally optimal
solution based on the state-of—art convex optimization
techniques.

0 The relationship between our model and other related
models is explained Via simulation of six popular scenarios.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
introduce our model, formulation and algorithm. In Section 3,
we report experimental results. Finally, we conclude our article
with some discussions in Section 4.

2 METHODS

2.1 Formulation

In Rueda and Diaz-Uriarte (2010), six popular recurrent CNV scenarios
are deﬁned in detail. Our method for detecting recurrent CNVs is moti-
vated by the low-rank property of these scenarios as illustrated in
Figure 1. Basically, the number of recurrent CNV regions determines
the rank of the matrix composed of multi-sample proﬁles. In Scenarios
(1), (3) and (5), for example, the rank of the matrix equals to 1 if we
assume the matrix values are +1, —1 and 0 for the probes marked as gain,
loss and no alteration, respectively. In Scenarios (2) and (6), two recurrent
regions exist and the rank is 2. In Scenario (4), the pattern is more com-
plex and the rank is 3. Therefore, the problem of identifying recurrent
CNVs can be treated as a problem of recovering a low-rank matrix from
input data.

Mathematically, we express each dataset by a matrix D e R'W’, where
each row (1,- is a logz-ratio proﬁle of one sample, and n and p are the
numbers of samples and probes, respectively. Our task is to recover a low-
rank component X from D, such that rank(X) is small. The typical
approach for low-rank approximation is to compute the singular value
decomposition of the input matrix and form a new low-rank matrix using

Probes Probes

Fig. 1. Six popular scenarios of recurrent CNV regions deﬁned in Rueda
and Diaz-Uriarte (2010). The vertical axis indicates the sample index and
the horizontal axis indicates the probe index. If the intensity ratio is
piecewise constant along the probe axis for each sample, the intensity
ratios of the entire dataset can be approximated by a low-rank matrix

the ﬁrst few singular vectors (Eckart and Young, 1936). This procedure is
also named principal component analysis in statistics. The drawback of
traditional principal component analysis is that it is only optimal under
the assumption of Gaussian noise. However, aCGH data have large in-
tensity values, which cannot be modeled as Gaussian noise. These indi-
vidual-speciﬁc intensity values will severely corrupt the low-rank
approximation and make the ﬁtted model to deviate far away from the
true model.

Inspired by Candes et a]. (2011), we propose to use the following de-
composition model to detect the recurrent CNVs from noisy input:

D=X+E+e (1)

where X is a low-rank component, E is a sparse component and a is a
noise component. In aCGH data analysis, the low-rank component cor-
responds to the recurrent CNVs. The sparse component corresponds to
individual-speciﬁc CNVs or gross measurement errors that sparsely
appear at different locations for different samples. The noise component
corresponds to the small perturbation of the intensity value at each probe,
which is often modeled by i.i.d. Gaussian distribution with a zero mean.

To achieve the decomposition, the following minimization problem is
considered:

1
minx,E,. 5 Hell? + «rank(X) + n lEl I0 (2)
st. D=X+E+e

where |e||F 2 ix“. 6%. is the Frobenious norm and |E||0 is the Zo-norm
that counts the number of non-zero values in E. The solution to (2) will
give a penalized maximum likelihood estimate with respect to the vari-
ables X, E, e.

The proposed model in (2) is intractable because both the rank oper-
ator and the Zo-norm are combinatorial operators, which make (2) a NP-
hard problem. The traditional work-around for such problems is to use
the convex relaxation. Therefore, we replace the rank() by the nuclear
norm, which is deﬁned as |X||* = 2,; 0,, where 01, ~ >, a, are the

singular values of X. It is the tightest convex surrogate to the rank oper-
ator (Fazel, 2002) and has been widely used for low-rank matrix recovery
(Candes et al., 2011). We also replace the Zo-norm by the Zl-norm. The
Zl-norm is deﬁned as |X| ll 2 EL]. X,-j. The (1 relaxation has proven to be
a powerful technique for sparse signal recovery (Tropp, 2006).

In addition, we like to introduce a smoothness penalty on each row
of X to reﬂect the prior that the recovered proﬁle should be piecewise
constant. The total-variation norm, which is deﬁned as ||x||TV =
2&2 |x,— — xH |, is adopted in the proposed model.

Finally, the problem to be solved reads as follows:

It
grigéllD —x — Eni+mnxn M2; iixmw +i5||E||1 (3)
where x,- is the i-th row of X.
The equality constraint in (2) is eliminated by replacing a with
D — X — E. The optimization in (3) is convex. Thus, the global optimal
solution can be found. As the recovered X is the piecewise-constant and
low-rank approximation of D, we name our model PLA. We will intro-
duce the algorithm in the next subsection.

2.2 Algorithm

Although the problem in (3) is convex, it cannot be solved directly using
generic convex optimization software such as CVX (Grant and Boyd,
2008) because of the large size of our problem. In this article, we propose
an efﬁcient and scalable algorithm based on the alternating direction
method of multipliers (Boyd, 2010).

The ﬁrst step is to separate the two non-smooth functions of X by
introducing an auxiliary variable Z and rewrite (3) as follows:

. 1 "
gillilll) —X—Elli+a1llxll* +a2;llzillTV +/5||E||1 (4)

SI. XZZ

Next, the augmented lagrangian is introduced to eliminate the equality
constraint in (4), which reads

1 n
£(X.Z.Y) =§||D —X—Ei|%+miixn. “afﬁrm-MTV
1'21 (5)
+i5llE||1+ <Y.x —Z> +§i|X—ZII%

where (>, >) denotes the inner product, Y is the dual variable and p is an
adaptively tuned parameter that controls the convergence of the algo-
rithm. The ﬁnal result of optimization will not be affected by p if it is
chosen properly. Please refer to (Boyd, 2010) for more details.

To solve (4), the following updating steps are alternated until
convergence

2 (- arg mxin z:(x, ii, 9) (6)
2 (- arg mzin ax, LE, 9) (7)
ii (- arg mEin ax, 2, E, y) (8)

?+?+p(X—Z) (9)

The iteration of above steps will ﬁnally converge to the solution of
problem (4). The theoretical proof for the convergence can be found in
(Boyd, 2010).

The remaining issue is how to solve the steps in (6) to (8). The problem
in (6) can be reduced to

that becomes a nuclear-norm regularized least-squares problem and has
the following closed-form solution (Cai et al., 2010)

Here, (x) + = max(x, 0). {u,—}, {v,-} and {of} are the left singular vectors, the
right singular vectors and the singular values of M, respectively.
The problem in (7) can be rewritten as follows:

Apparently, each row of Z can be updated separately

Problem (14) is the fused lasso signal approximation problem that can be
solved efﬁciently (Liu et al., 2010).
The problem in (8) can be rewritten as follows:

. 1 A

It admits a closed-form solution
ﬁ=sﬁ(D—X), (16)

where Sg(M),-j = sign(M ,-J-)(M ,1- — ,8),r refers to the elementwise soft-
thresholding operator (Boyd, 2010).

Overall, the algorithm to optimize the proposed model in (3) is sum-
marized in Algorithm 1. The convex program will give a global optimal
solution independent of initialization.

2.3 Parameter selection

We select the parameters a1, a2 and ,8 in our model (3) based on the
analysis in two similar models (Candes et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010).
The proper values should depend on the size of the input matrix (n, p) and
the standard variation of the noise a.

The relative weight A 2 [5/051 balances the two terms in
a1||X||* + ,B||E||1 and consequently controls the rank of X. The model
in (Candes et al., 2011) only includes these two terms. Candes et a]. (2011)
has proved that A = 1 Afrﬁ gives a large probability of recovering X and
E under their assumed conditions and stated that this value can be

sparse component recovered by PLA, respectively. Bottom row: the results of three alternative methods TVSp (Zhou et £11., 2013), MSSCAN (Zhang

et £11., 2010a) and FLLat (Nowak et £11., 2011)

adjusted slightly to obtain the best results in specific applications. m is
the larger dimension of the input matrix. In our problem, m: p, i.e. the
number of probes. In the synthesized experiments, we simply set
,6 = on Am. On real datasets, the recurrent CNVs rarely form a perfectly
low-rank matrix, and we use ,6 = 2a1/ﬁ to keep sufﬁcient variations
in X.

The parameter «1 serves as a threshold in the SVT step in (11). It
should be large enough to threshold out the noise but not too large
to over-shrink the signal (Zhou et £11., 2010). A proper value is
on = (ﬂ+ mo, which is the expected Zz-norm of a n x p random
matrix with entries sampled from N(0,02). As CNVs are sparse in the
data, we can estimate a from the data by the median-absolute—deviation
estimator (Meer et £11., 1991)

6 = 1.48 median{ |D — median(D)|} (17)

As 052 only controls the smoothness of the recovered proﬁles, we
empirically set 052 = 0.01011.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Synthetic datasets

3.1.1 Accuracy comparison In Rueda and Diaz-Uriarte (2010),
six scenarios of recurrent CNVs are discussed (illustrated in
Fig. 1). We adopt these six scenarios to generate synthetic
data. For each scenario, 50 samples of aCGH proﬁles with a
length of 200 probes are generated. The default signal value
for no variation is set as 0. The recurrent variations are located
in the interval from Probe 76 to Probe 125 with the patterns
identical to the six scenarios given in Figure 1. The logz ratio
is 1 for a gain and —1 for a loss. For each sample, an individual-
speciﬁc variation with a length of 20 probes is added at a random
location that does not overlap with the recurrent region. The logz
ratio of each individual-speciﬁc variation is randomly sampled
from {—2, — 1,1,2}. Finally, we add i.d.d Gaussian noises to
all probes.

The synthetic dataset of Scenario 2 is illustrated in the ﬁrst
panel of Figure 2. Each row of the matrix is a proﬁle of a
sample. There are two recurrent variation regions. The ﬁrst
one is located at Probes 76 ~ 95, where 30 samples have gains.
The second one is located at Probes 96 ~ 125, where 20 samples
have losses. The task is to recover the recurrent patterns from
this matrix.

Our results are given in the second and third images in
Figure 2. The recurrent CNVs are clearly presented in the low-
rank component, while the individual-speciﬁc CNVs are mostly
included in the sparse component. The rank of the recovered
low-rank component is 6, which is slightly larger than the
truth. We used the default parameter setting without any prior
or tuning. The results of three closely related methods are given
in the bottom row. TVSp (Zhou et £11., 2013) aims to detect all
CNVs. Therefore, it cannot separate recurrent variations from
individual-speciﬁc variations. MSSCAN (Zhang et £11., 2010a)
attempts to ﬁnd the common change points across samples
and uses the mean intensity in each segment to reconstruct the
proﬁles. Consequently, the segmentation process is largely inﬂu-
enced by the individual-speciﬁc variations resulting in unfaithful
reconstruction of recurrent patterns. FLLat (Nowak ct £11., 2011)
tries to recover the common features across proﬁles. However,
the recovery is corrupted because FLLat adopts a least-squares
loss to ﬁt the model without considering the individual-speciﬁc
signals.

To quantitatively evaluate these methods, we calculate the
true-positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate (FPR) of recur-
rent CNV identiﬁcation and plot the receiver operating charac-
teristic curves (TPR versus FPR) under six scenarios with a noise
level of a :1. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curves are shown in Figure 3. A curve closer to the top and
left borders indicates a better performance. To illustrate the im-
portance of smoothness penalty in PLA, we also give the result of

and the FPR, respectively

PLA without smoothness by setting )3 = 0 in (3). The ROC
curves are produced by thresholding the recovered matrix with
different thresholds.

For Scenarios l, 3 and 5, both PLA and FLLat achieve nearly
perfect results. For Scenarios 2, 4 and 6, the performance of them
drops while PLA apparently outperforms FLLat. The difference
between these two groups of scenarios is that there is only one
recurrent region in Scenario 1, 3 and 5, while the other three
scenarios involve more complicated recurrent patterns. When
raw aCGH data contains two or more recurrent regions,
FLLat is more prone to be inﬂuenced by the individual-speciﬁc
variations. The expected number of recurrent regions is given as
an input in FLLat, while it is not required in our algorithm. In
practice, it is unrealistic to have such information. MSSCAN
cannot differentiate between the recurrent and individual-speciﬁc
CNVs during the segmentation step. Therefore, the output seg-
mented matrix will be inﬂuenced by the individual-speciﬁc CNVs
in a way similar to what is shown in Figure 2. Consequently, the
corresponding ROC of MSSCAN is lower compared with PLA.
It can also be observed that, in all six scenarios, removing the
smoothness constraint will degrade the performance of PLA,
which tells us that it is important to consider the smoothness
constraint in the recurrent CNV identiﬁcation.

3.1.2 Detection limit To illustrate the limit of population fre-
quency for a variation being detected as a recurrent variation by

our model, we simulate a dataset with 50 samples and a single
variation region. The number of samples carrying the variation
and the length of the variation are varying. To see whether the
variation signal is detected, we calculate the relative difference
between two matrices by ||X — XollF/llXollF, where X is the re-
covered low-rank matrix and X0 is the simulated variation signal.
A smaller value indicates a better approximation to the variation
signal by the recovered low-rank component. The results are
summarized in Figure 4. When the signal is strong (covering
sufﬁcient number of probes), it can be detected even if the recur-
rent frequency is small. For instance, the variation with a length
of 10 probes is well detected if more than five samples carry it.
When the signal is abrupt (covering few probes), it is unlikely to
be detected even if the frequency is large because the signal is
more likely to be included in the sparse component and the
smoothness constraint will also prevent such signal from being
detected. In practice, a spike-like signal is unlikely to be a true
CNV. The results also depend on the relative weight between the
low-rank term and the sparse term in our formulation. We used
the default parameter setting in this experiment.

3.2 Real applications

To illustrate the applicability of our method in real cases, we
have applied PLA to analyze two independent breast tumor
datasets. We focused on the analysis of Chromosome 17,
which has many frequently altered regions (Bekhouche et a1.,

2011; Pollack ct £11., 2002). The ﬁrst dataset is from Pollack ct £11.
(2002), which consists of aCGH proﬁles of 44 breast tumors over
382 probes for Chromosome 17. The second dataset is from
Bekhouche ct £11. (2011) with a much higher resolution. It con-
tains aCGH proﬁles of 173 breast tumors over 7727 unique
probes for Chromosome 17. To remove the wave bias in each
proﬁle, we subtract the raw logz ratios by local median values.
The window size for the median calculation is one-fourth of the
chromosome length.

The heat maps of input data are shown in the top panels in
Figure 5, followed by the low-rank and sparse components re-
covered by PLA. As we can see, the recurrent patterns are clearly
presented in the low-rank components, while the individual-spe-
ciﬁc variations are mostly included in the sparse components.
The rank of the low-rank component is 11 in Figure 5a and 55
in Figure 5b. To summarize the results, we calculated the fre-
quency of gains G, and losses L, at each probe i by

Gj=%Zl(Xy>D,Lj=%Zl(Xy<—D (18)

where T is a threshold that is set be 0.25 and 1 denotes the
indicator function. The results are given in the fourth row in
Figure 5. The recurrent regions can be clearly identiﬁed from
the frequency plots, which are mainly located in the chromosome
regions 17q11.2, 17q12, 17q21.3-q22 and 17q25. These identiﬁed
regions match the results from both references (Bekhouche ct £11.,
2011; Pollack ct £11., 2002). Many breast cancer-related genes are
located in these regions. For example, genes ERBB2 and
C17orf37 are located around Probe 3460 in Figure 5b, where a
high peak appears in the frequency plot. Gene ERBB2 status is
often used to indicate grades or stages of breast tumors. Gene
C17orf37 is abundantly expressed in breast cancer and is claimed
to be a tumor biomarker (Evans et £11., 2006). For simple

Fig. 5. The experimental results on the aCGH datasets from (a) Pollack et a1. (2002) and (b) Bekhouche et a1. (2011). Only Chromosome 17 is shown

here. From top to bottom are the heat map of the input matrix, the recovered low-rank component, the sparse component, the recurrent frequency of

alternations by thresholding the output of PLA and the recurrent frequency of alternations by thresholding the output of MSSCAN, respectively. For
the bar plots, positive and negative y-values correspond to gains and losses, respectively

comparison, the results using MSSCAN are shown in the bottom
panels. The frequency plot of MSSCAN is obtained by thresh-
olding the segmentation result of MSSCAN. Compared with
MSSCAN, our result is more sparse but accurately captures
the recurrent regions that have been verified to have high cor-
relation with breast cancer using gene expression (Bekhouche
et al., 2011).

3.3 Computational cost

We test the algorithm on a desktop PC with a 3.4GHz Intel i7
CPU and 8 GB RAM. For the dataset from Pollack et a1. (2002)
with 44 samples and 382 probes, PLA takes 0.4 s while MSSCAN
takes 24.8 s. For the dataset from Bekhouche et a1. (2011) with
173 samples and 7227 probes, PLA takes 146.4 s while MSSCAN
takes 322.1 s. For the dataset from Bekhouche et a1. (2011), the
peak value of RAM usage of our program is 90 MB while that
of MSSCAN is 170 MB.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we propose a new method to identify recurrent
CNVs Via recovering a low-rank matrix from raw aCGH pro-
ﬁles. The proposed method models different scenarios in a single
framework. With a convex formulation, our algorithm guaran-
tees a global optimal solution. We demonstrate the ability of our
method to separate recurrent CNVs from other variations in
both simulated data and real data. The low-rank matrix output
of our method can be used as an input to other recurrent region-
ﬁnding algorithms based on permutation test or other statistical
analyses.

After the decomposition, the individual-speciﬁc CNVs are
mostly included in the sparse component, as shown in
Figures 2 and 5. However, the sparse component may also con-
tain noise and measurement error. To precisely detect individual-
speciﬁc CNVs, we may have to apply a postprocessing step to
the sparse component. Another possible approach is to ﬁrst use
existing algorithms (e. g. fused lasso and TVSp) to remove noise
in aCGH proﬁles and then apply our model to decompose the
processed proﬁles into recurrent CNVs (low rank) and individ-
ual-speciﬁc CNVs (sparse).

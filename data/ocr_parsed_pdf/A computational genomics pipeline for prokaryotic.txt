ABSTRACT

Motivation: New sequencing technologies have accelerated
research on prokaryotic genomes and have made genome
sequencing operations outside major genome sequencing centers
routine. However, no off-the-shelf solution exists for the combined
assembly, gene prediction, genome annotation and data presentation
necessary to interpret sequencing data. The resulting requirement
to invest significant resources into custom informatics support for
genome sequencing projects remains a major impediment to the
accessibility of high-throughput sequence data.

Results: We present a self-contained, automated high-throughput
open source genome sequencing and computational genomics
pipeline suitable for prokaryotic sequencing projects. The pipeline
has been used at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention for the analysis of Neisseria
meningitidis and Bordetella bronchiseptica genomes. The pipeline is
capable of enhanced or manually assisted reference-based assembly
using multiple assemblers and modes; gene predictor combining;
and functional annotation of genes and gene products. Because
every component of the pipeline is executed on a local machine
with no need to access resources over the Internet, the pipeline is
suitable for projects of a sensitive nature. Annotation of virulence-
related features makes the pipeline particularly useful for projects
working with pathogenic prokaryotes.

Availability and implementation: The pipeline is licensed under
the open-source GNU General Public License and available at the
Georgia Tech Neisseria Base (http://nbase.biology.gatech.edu/). The
pipeline is implemented with a combination of Perl, Bourne Shell and
MySQL and is compatible with Linux and other Unix systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome sequencing projects, pioneered in the 1990s (Fleischmann
et al., 1995), require large-scale computational support in

order to make their data accessible for use and interpretation
by biologists. Large sequencing centers have traditionally
employed or collaborated with teams of software engineers and
computational biologists to develop the software and algorithms for
sequencing hardware interfaces, enterprise data storage, sequence
assembly and ﬁnishing, genome feature prediction and annotation,
database mining, comparative analysis and database user interface
development. While many of the components developed by these
teams are now available online under open-access terms, the
development of new, high-throughput sequencing technologies has
necessitated updates to these tools and development of even more
sophisticated algorithms to address the Challenges raised by the
new data. These new technologies—454 pyrosequencing (Margulies
et al., 2005), ABI SOLiD (Shendure et al., 2005) and Illumina
(Bentley et al., 2008)—are now collectively referred to as second
generation sequencing technologies. Similar updates will be needed
as the third generation of sequencing technologies, such as Paciﬁc
Biosciences’ SMRT sequencing (Eid et al., 2009), enter production
use. New and improved tools released for these technologies on a
monthly basis include assemblers, mapping algorithms, base calling
and error correction tools, and a multitude of other programs.
Because of this fast pace of development, few experts are able
to keep up with the state of the art in the ﬁeld of computational
genomics. Accordingly, the rate limiting step in genome sequencing
projects is no longer the experimental Characterization of the data
but rather the availability of experts and resources for computational
analysis.

At the same time, the increased affordability of these new
sequencing machines has spawned a new generation of users who
were previously unable to perform their own genome sequencing,
and thus collaborated with large sequencing centers for genome
sequencing and subsequent computational analysis. While these
users are now able to experimentally Characterize genomes in house,
they often ﬁnd themselves struggling to take ﬁill advantage of the
resulting data and to make it useﬁil to the scientiﬁc community since
the informatics support for their genome projects is not sufﬁcient.

Several large sequencing consortia (Aziz et al., 2008; Markowitz
et al., 2009; Seshadri et al., 2007) have produced comprehensive,
centralized web-based portals for the analysis of genomic and
metagenomic data. While extremely useﬁil for many types of
projects and collaborations, these solutions inherently result in a

loss of data processing ﬂexibility compared to locally installed
resources and may be unsuitable for projects dealing with sensitive
data. Recently, another group (Stewart et al., 2009) has published
DIYA, a software package for gene prediction and annotation
in bacterial genomes with a modularized, open source microbial
genome processing pipeline. However, DIYA does not include
a genome assembly component, and does not provide for the
combination of complementary algorithms for genome analysis.

To address the outstanding Challenges for local computational
genomics support, we have developed a state of the art,
self-contained, automated high-throughput open source software
pipeline for computational genomics in support of prokaryotic
sequencing projects. To ensure the relevance of our pipeline,
we Checked the latest developments in computational genomics
software for all stages of the pipeline, such as new versions of
assembly and gene prediction programs and comparative surveys,
and selected what we deemed to be the most suitable software
packages. The pipeline is self-contained; that is, we used locally
installable versions of all third-party tools instead of web-based
services provided by many groups. We Chose to do so for three
reasons: ﬁrst, because some of the applications we envision for
this pipeline are of sensitive nature; second, to enhance robustness
to external Changes (e.g., online API Changes or website address
Changes); and third, to improve the ability of developers to customize
and derive from our pipeline. The pipeline is also automated and
high-throughput: all components are organized in a hierarchical
set of readily modiﬁable scripts, and the use of safe programming
practices ensures that multiple copies of the pipeline can be run in
parallel, taking advantage of multiple processors where possible.

Importantly, by using and combining the outputs of competitive,
complementary algorithms for multiple stages of genome analysis,
our pipeline allows for substantial improvement upon single-
program solutions. The use of multiple algorithms also provides a
way to improve robustness and conduct more comprehensive quality
control when the output of one program is signiﬁcantly different
from that of another.

Computational support provided to prokaryotic genome projects
by our pipeline can be subdivided into three stages: ﬁrst, sequencing
and assembly; second, feature prediction; and third, ﬁinctional
annotation. For the assembly stage, we developed a custom
protocol speciﬁc to 454 pyrosequenced data, which resulted in
a signiﬁcant improvement to assembly quality of our test data
compared to the baseline assembler bundled by the manufacturer.
Other assemblers can be plugged in if necessary, and data from
other sequencing technologies such as ABI SOLiD, Illumina and
Sanger capillary-based machines can be used. For the prediction
stage, we again included a custom combination of feature prediction
methods for protein-coding genes, RNA genes, operon and
promoter regions, which improves upon the individual constituent
methods. The annotation stage includes several types of protein
ﬁinctional prediction algorithms. We also developed components for
comparative analysis, interpretation and presentation (a web-based
genome browser), which can be used downstream of our pipeline.

We have tested the pipeline on the bacterium Neisseria
meningitidis, which is a human commensal of the nasopharanx and
which can sometimes cause meningitis or septicemia (Rosenstein
et al., 2001). When N.meningitidis does cause disease, it can
be devastating with an ~10% fatality rate and 15% sequelae
rate. Neisseria meningitidis is a highly competent organism with

a high recombination rate, and large Chromosomal Changes are
common (Jolley et al., 2005; Schoen et al., 2008). This complicates
computational genome analysis and makes N.meningitidis an
appropriately Challenging test for our pipeline. To demonstrate
the general applicability of the pipeline, we have also tested
it on a different pathogen, Bordetella bronchiseptica. Bordetella
bronchiseptica is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause
bronchitis in humans, although it is more commonly found in smaller
mammals (Parkhill et al., 2003). Much like Neisseria, Bordetella has
extensive plasticity, likely due to the large number of repeat elements
(Gerlach et al., 2001). Here, we analyze the ﬁrst two complete
genome sequences of B.br0nchiseptica strains isolated from human
hosts.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. The ‘System and
Methods’ section describes the genomes which we used to test our
pipeline, overall organization of the pipeline, and details of the
algorithms used to perform tasks in the pipeline. In the ‘Discussion’
section, we discuss the objectives of our work on the pipeline and
how these relate to larger developments in computational biology
for next-generation sequencing.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Genome test data

Neisseria meningitidis genomes were characterized Via 454 pyrosequencing
(Margulies at al., 2005) using either half or one quarter plate runs on
the Roche 454 GS-20 or GS Titanium instrument (Table 1). For each
genome, a random shotgun library was produced using Roche protocols for
nebulization, end-polishing, adaptor ligation, nick repair and single-stranded
library formation. Following emulsion PCR, DNA bound beads were isolated
and sequenced using long-read (LR) sequencing kits. The number of reads
produced in the experiments ranged from 200 000 to 600 000, and the average
read lengths were between 100 and 330 bases. These data yielded 47.&
94.3 million bases per genome amounting to 20—40>< coverage for the
~22 Mb N.meningitidis genomes. After read trimming and re-ﬁltering to
recover short quality reads, the data were passed to the ﬁrst stage of the
pipelineigenome assembly.

2.2 Pipeline organization

The analytical pipeline consists of three integrated subsystems: genome
assembly, feature prediction and functional annotation. Each subsystem
consists of a top-level execution script managing the input, output, format
conversion and combination of results for a number of distinct software
components. A hierarchy of scripts and external programs then performs the
tasks required to complete each stage of analysis (Fig. 1).

2.3 Assembly

Genome assembly was performed by evaluating multiple conﬁgurations of
assemblers including the standard 454 assembler, Newbler (version 2.3),
as well the Celera Assembler (Miller at al., 2008), the Phrap assembler
(http://www.phrap.org/) and the AMOScmp mapped assembler (Pop at al.,
2004). Several other assemblers were evaluated but ultimately excluded from
the pipeline due to use limitations: for instance, the ALLPATHS 2 assembler
(MacCallum at al., 2009) required paired-end reads to operate; our evaluation
data contained no paired-end reads, and such a requirement unnecessarily
constrains the user’s options. The widely used Velvet assembler (Zerbino and
Birney, 2008) was originally developed as a de novo assembler for Illumina
sequencing technology, but its capability has been extended to accommodate
454 data as well. However, we were unable to conﬁgure the Velvet assembler
to produce a usable assembly or take advantage of reference genomes using
454 data alone.

Evaluation of the results indicated that mapped assemblies of
N.meningitidis genomes using previously ﬁnished strains were of superior
quality to de novo assemblies. Using the most appropriate reference strains,
it was found that Newbler and AMOScmp complement each other’s

performance in the assembly stage, with Newbler being able to join some
contigs AMOScmp left gapped and vice versa. As a result, we decided to use
a combination of these two assemblers” outputs for the ﬁnal assembly. Then,

simple assembler for short genomes, was used to combine the constituent
assemblies.

We also evaluated alternative base calling algorithms for 454
pyrosequencing data (Quinlan et al., 2008) but detected no improvement.
Over the course of our project, accuracy of base calling in the Newbler
assembler was reported to be signiﬁcantly improved. We used the latest
version of the assembler available at publication time (Section 2.3).

An optional component of the pipeline was created for frameshift detection
using FSFind (Kislyuk et al., 2009). Frameshifts in protein-coding sequences
are a known result of pyrosequencing errors caused by undercalls and
overcalls in homopolymer runs (Kuo and Grigoriev, 2009). Brieﬂy, this
package creates a GeneMark model of the genome, makes gene predictions,
and then scans the genome for possible frameshift positions on the basis
of ORF conﬁguration and coding potential. Once the possible frameshift
sites are identiﬁed, a putative translation of the protein possibly encoded
by the broken gene is compared against a protein database (SwissProt
by default). The predicted frameshift site is also scanned for adjacent
homopolymers. A heuristic set of conﬁdence score cutoffs is then used to
provide a set of frameshift predictions while minimizing the false positive
rate. The predicted frameshift sites can then be veriﬁed experimentally
or corrected speculatively. The user can inspect the dataset to decide
whether locations predicted to contain frarneshifts break gene models, and
patch the sequences to ﬁx up these positions. The prediction stage can
then be re-run to correct the gene predictions. While further experimental
analysis to address such errors is desirable (e.g. targeted PCR of predicted
error locations or a recently popular choice of combining sequencing
technologies such as 454 and Illumina), it incurs extra costs which we aim
to avoid.

Unﬁnished assemblies produced in this stage contained 907300 contigs
each. No paired-end libraries or runs were available for the strains
analyzed, and therefore scaffolding of the contigs was a challenge. Manual
examination of the assemblies using the MAUVE (Darling et al., 2004)
multiple whole-genome alignment and Visualization package revealed
numerous locations where contigs could be scaffolded with a small gap
or minimal overlap (Fig. 2). As an optional step, we produced a table
of such positions and a script which would scaffold contigs joined by
the gap.

Then, a manual gap joining stage used the layout of the contigs according
to their aligned positions on the reference using the AMOS package and
manual examination of each gap, adjacent contig alignments and reference
annotation in the MAUVE Visualization tool. Although there is a possibility
that rearrangements exist in those gaps as mapped to the closest reference
genome, joining was only done after manual examination on a case-by-case
basis in positions of high homology and full consensus between four of the
reference strains, to minimize this possibility. While we provide the scripts
and data format deﬁnitions necessary to complete this stage of the pipeline,
it involves manual processing of the assembly and is therefore optional. This
component is similar in function to Mauve Contig Mover (Rissman et al.,
2009) but expands upon it in several ways. An option is provided in the
pipeline to use Mauve Contig Mover.

The manually assisted genome assembly procedure resulted in an order-
of-magnitude decrease in the number of gaps in comparison to the Newbler
assembler (which in turn performed the best out of all standalone assemblers
evaluated). In addition, the fully automated assembly metrics (N50 and contig
count at equal minimal size) are an ~20750% improvement upon baseline
Newbler performance (Table 2).

The contigs in the assembly stage output were named according to the
following format: preﬁx_contig#, where the preﬁx represents a unique strain
identiﬁer and # represents the zero-padded sequential number indicating the
contig’s predicted order on the chromosome. For example, the 25th contig
for the N. meningitidis strain M13220 assembly would be named as
CDC_NME_M13320_O25. The preﬁx used in the pipeline is conﬁgurable
by the user with a command line option.

2.4 Feature prediction

Feature prediction was performed in the genome using a suite of several
programs. To predict genes, we used a combination of de nova and
comparative methods. The Glimmer (Delcher et al., 1999) and GeneMark
(Besemer et al., 2001) microbial gene predictors were used for de nova
prediction, and BLASTp alignment (Altschul et al., 1997) of putative
proteins was used for comparative prediction. Self-training procedures
were followed for both de nova predictors, and the results, while highly
concordant, were different enough (Table 3) to justify the inclusion of both
algorithms. BLASTp alignment of all open reading frames (ORFs) at least
90 nt long was performed using the Swiss-Prot protein database (Boeckmann
et al., 2003).

The results of these three methods were combined together using a
combiner strategy outlined in Figure 3. In this strategy, we ﬁrst check
that at least half of the predictors report a gene in a given ORFiin our
conﬁguration, 2 of the 3 predictors. Then, the Met (putative translation
start) codon closest to the beginning of the BLAST alignment is found and
declared to be the gene start predicted by BLAST. We then ﬁnd the gene start
coordinate reported by the majority of the three predictors and report the
resulting gene prediction. If no majority exists, we select the most upstream
gene start predicted.

In addition to protein-coding gene prediction, ribosomal genes were
predicted using alignment to a reference database of ribosomal operons,
and tRNA genes were predicted using the tRNAScan-SE package (Lowe
and Eddy, 1997). The results are summarized in Table 3.

Results of the feature prediction stage are saved in a multi-extent GenBank
formatted ﬁle. Features were named according to the following convention:
contig-name_feature-id, where contig-name is as described earlier, and
feature-id is a sequential zero-padded number unique to the feature across
all contigs. For example, a gene with feature ID 1293 on contig 25 might
have the name CDC_NME_M13320_O25_1293.

To validate the overall accuracy of the gene prediction stage of the
pipeline, we ran our gene prediction tools on the genome of Escherichia cali
K12, one of the best-annotated bacterial genomes (analysis described in
the Supplementary Material). Our pipeline was able to detect 95.7% of
the annotated E.cali K12 protein-coding genes, and exactly predict starts in
85.5% of those. Fifty percent of the E.cali predictions that report incorrect

start codons start within 35 nt of the true start, and all reported starts are
within 200 nt of the true start.

2.5 Functional annotation

Functional annotation of genome features was also performed using a
combination of tools. Annotation of protein coding genes was based on
an integrated platform that makes use of six distinct annotation tools, four
of which employ intrinsic sequence characteristics for annotation and two
that use extrinsic homology-based approaches to compare sequences against

databases of sequences and structures with known functions. Information
on Gene Ontology (GO) terms, domain architecture and identity, subcellular
localization, signal peptides, transmembrane helices and lipoprotein motifs
is provided for each protein-coding gene (Fig. 4).

BLASTp alignment of predicted proteins was performed against the
UniProt database (Uniprot, 2009). Homology-based searches were also made
across thirteen sequence and protein domain databases with the InterProScan
suite (Mulder and preiler, 2007). Parsing of the results was carried
out against the corresponding InterPro database. The pipeline also stores
the top ﬁve hits for each gene against the NCBI non-redundant protein

Fig. 4. Example functional annotation listing of a N.meningitia’is gene
in the Neisseria Base. Draft genome data are shown including gene

database, to provide potentially useful information. All homology searches
were run locally. Signal peptides were annotated using the SignalP package
(Bendtsen et al., 2004) and transmembrane domains were annotated with
the TMHMM package (Krogh et al., 2001). State of the art in subcellular
localization algorithms was examined to ensure the best performance
given our operational requirements. Insertion sequences (transposases) and
proteins reported as virulence factors by VFDB (Chen et al., 2005; Yang et al.,
2008) were also annotated. These annotations of virulence-related features
make the pipeline particularly useful for projects working with pathogenic
prokaryotes. Results of this analysis are summarized in Table 4.

After the functional annotations were determined, a naming scheme was
employed for each locus to conform to standard annotation terminology.
Speciﬁc gene names were assigned according to homology-based results.
For genes that had a Uniprot result with a best hit at >91% amino acid
sequence identity and an e-value <1e-9, the gene assumed the best hit’s
name. If the best hit had the keyword ’hypothetical’, then we used a
domain name from InterPro to name the gene. For example, if a gene
was given the name ‘hypothetical’ from Uniprot and a domain name of
‘transferase’ from InterPro, then the ﬁnal name was ‘hypothetical transferase
protein’. Therefore, most genes that were given ‘hypothetical’ or ‘putative’

preﬁxes could then be given a more compre-hensive name based on further
information such as domain names or protein functions. Genes with unknown
functions found across many genomes were given the name ‘conserved
hypothetical protein’, and all other putative genes with unknown functions
were given the name ‘putative uncharacterized protein’.

2.6 Availability

The pipeline software package is available at our website
(http://nbase.biology.gatech.edu). The package contains detailed instructions
and scripts for installation of the pipeline and all external programs,
documentation on usage of the pipeline and its organization. Components
which require large biological databases automatically download local
copies of those databases upon installation.

All of the N.meningitia’is genomes reported here, along with custom
annotations and tools for searching and comparative sequence analysis,
are available for researchers online at our genome browser database
(http://nbase.biology.gatech.edu).

3 DISCUSSION

3.1 Genome biology of N.meningitidis and
B.br0nchiseptica

We have used the pathogen N.meningitidis for the majority of
developmental and production testing of our pipeline. Although
N.meningitidis gains no ﬁtness advantage from virulence, it
occasionally leaves its commensal state and causes devastating
disease (Meyers et al., 2003). Several recent studies have used
whole-genome analysis to determine the basis of virulence in this
species but none have been conclusive (Hotopp et al., 2006; Perrin
et al., 2002; Schoen et al., 2008). With the recent advent of next-
generation sequencing and the application of an analytical pipeline,
such as presented here, this problem and other problems like it can be
addressed in individual laboratories on a genome-wide scale. Here,
we brieﬂy speculate on a few of the implications of our ﬁndings for
the genome biology of N.meningitidis to underscore the potential
utility of our pipeline.

Whole-genome analysis of microbes has led to the development
of the ‘pan-genome’ concept (Tettelin et al., 2005). A pan-genome
refers to the collection of all genes found within different strains
of the same species. An open pan-genome means that the genome
of any given strain will contain unique genes not found within the
genomes of other known strains of the same species. The extent
to which microbial pan-genomes are open is a matter of debate
(Lapierre and Gogarten, 2009). Recent studies have suggested that
the N.meningitidis pan-genome is essentially open (Schoen et al.,
2008), consistent with the fact that it is known to be a highly
competent species (Chen and Dubnau, 2004; Kroll et al., 1998).
We evaluated this hypothesis by ﬁnding the number of unique
genes in each of the seven strains reported here along with seven
previously published strains, using the results of our analytical
pipeline. Our ﬁndings are consistent with Schoen et al. (2008), in the
sense that every genome sequence was found to contain at least 43
unique genes not found in any other strain. Thus, the N.meningitidis
pan-genome does appear to be open.

N.meningitidis is a human commensal that most often does not
cause disease, and avirulent strains of the species are referred to as
carriage strains. Results of previous comparative genomic analyses
have been taken to suggest that carriage strains represent a distinct
evolutionary group that is basal to a group of related virulent strains

of N.meningitidis (Schoen et al., 2008). We tested this hypothesis
using the results of our analytical pipeline applied to three carriage
strains and eight virulent strains of N.meningitidis. Whole-genome
sequences were aligned and pairwise distances between genomes,
based on nucleotide diversity levels, were compared within and
between groups of carriage and virulent strains. We found that
average of the pairwise genome sequence distances within (w)
the carriage and virulent groups of strains was not signiﬁcantly
different from the average pairwise distances between (b) groups
(w=0.074:l:0.027, b=0.090:l:0.014, 7:0.693, P=0.491). This
result is inconsistent with the previously held notion that carriage
and virulent strains represent distinct evolutionary groups based on
whole-genome analysis. However, our ﬁndings are consistent with
earlier work that found little genetic differentiation between carriage
and virulent strains of N.meningitidis (Jolley et al., 2005).
Currently, there is no unambiguous molecular assay to distinguish
B.bronchiseptica from other Bordetella species. One reason the
two B.bronchiseptica genomes reported here were characterized
was to discover genes unique to the species (i.e. not present in
any other Bordetella species) to facilitate the development of a
B.bronchiseptica-speciﬁc PCR assay. To identify such genes, we
performed BLASTn with B. bronchiseptica query genes uncovered
by our pipeline against other B. bronchiseptica strain genomes
along with four genomes of closely related Bordetella species. We
uncovered a total of 223 genes that are present in all B. bronchiseptica
strains and absent in all other Bordetella species. To narrow down
this set of potential PCR assay targets, we searched for the most
conserved B. bronchiseptica-speciﬁc genes. As a point of reference,
we determined the sodC gene used in the N.meningitidis-speciﬁc
PCR assay (Kroll et al., 1998) to be 99.6% identical among all six
completely sequenced strains of N.meningitidis. There are seven B.
bronchiseptica-speciﬁc genes with 399.6% sequence identity; these
genes represent a prioritized list of potential PCR assay targets.

3.2 Computational genomics pipeline

We have presented our computational genomics pipeline, a local
solution for automated, high-throughput computational support of
prokaryotic genome sequencing projects. While the revolution
in sequencing technology makes possible the execution of

genome projects within individual laboratories, the computational
infrastructure to fully realize this possibility does not yet exist.
We made a comprehensive effort to put the tools required for
this infrastructure into the hands of biologists working with next-
generation sequencing data. Our aim in the course of this project was
to facilitate decentralized biological discoveries based on affordable
whole-genome prokaryotic sequencing, a mode of science termed
‘investigator—initiated genomics’. For example, one project enabled
by the pipeline in our laboratory is a platform for SNP detection and
analysis in groups of bacterial genomes.

One of our major goals was to provide full automation of our
pipeline’s entire workﬂow, and this has been achieved. On the
other hand, to allow computationally savvy users to realize the
power of customizability, a semi-automated process is desirable.
We have made an effort to strike a balance between these objectives,
and provide a modular, hierarchically organized structure to permit
maximum customization when so desired.

The state of the art in prokaryotic computational genomics
moves at a formidable pace. The modular organization of our
pipeline, along with the emphasis on integration of complementary
software tools, allows us to continually update our platform to keep
pace with developments in computational genomics. For instance,
if a new, better assembler becomes available, we can include
its results in the assembly stage with a simple change to the
pipeline code.

Abstract

Summary: MetMSLine represents a complete collection of functions in the R programming
language as an accessible GUI for biomarker discovery in large—scale liquid—chromatography
high—resolution mass spectral datasets from acquisition through to final metabolite identification
forming a backend to output from any peak—picking software such as XCMS. MetMSLine automat—
ically creates subdirectories, data tables and relevant figures at the following steps: (i) signal
smoothing, normalization, filtration and noise transformation (PreProc.OC.LSC.R); (ii) PCA and
automatic outlier removal (Auto.PCA.R); (iii) automatic regression, biomarker selection, hierarch—
ical clustering and cluster ion/artefact identification (Auto.Ml/.Regress.R); (iv) Biomarker—MS/MS
fragmentation spectra matching and fragment/neutral loss annotation (Auto.MS.MS.match.R)
and (v) semi—targeted metabolite identification based on a list of theoretical masses obtained from
public databases (DBAnnotate.R).

Availability and implementation: All source code and suggested parameters are available in an
un—encapsulated layout on http://wmbedmands.github.io/MetMSLine/. Readme files and a syn—
thetic dataset of both X—variables (simulated LC—MS data), Y—variables (simulated continuous vari—

 

ables) and metabolite theoretical masses are also available on our GitHub repository.

1 Introduction

Untargeted metabolite profiling is a promising approach to dis—
cover novel risk factors for chronic diseases and biomarkers for dis—
ease diagnosis (Wang et (11., 2011; Ritchie et (11., 2013). Liquid
chromatography coupled to high—resolution mass spectrometry
(LC—hrMS) instrumentation is being more routinely used for data—
acquisition for metabolomic analyses in large—scale studies (e.g.
>300 samples). Raw data need to be processed via computational
tools to extract relevant information and meaningful biological
conclusions.

Processing of LC—hrMS raw data is currently facilitated by
softwares such as XCMS, MzMine, MetaboAnalyst and Maven
(Smith et al. 2006; Pluskal et al. 2010; Clasquin et al. 2012;

Xia et al. 2012). However, an automated software pipeline with
minimal manual interaction for efficient, reproducible and objective
large—scale metabolomic data analysis is also desirable. Software
tools can systematically perform all downstream aspects of metabo—
lomic analysis following peak—picking. Development of such a work—
ﬂow in the R language can offer several advantages such as
availability of modular packages for functional programming and
graphics and the ease of accessibility of a GUI for non—specialists.
We have developed novel software, MetMSLine, coded in the R
language which automates the process of untargeted metabolomic
data analyses of large datasets from acquisition of data from
LC—hrMS platforms through to unknown biomarker identification.

2 Results

An overview of data processing steps that are integrated by
MetMSLine is shown in Figure 1. Use of the software via GUI
requires a clear understanding of data processing steps in
metabolomics.

2.1 Step 1: Pre—processing of raw data matrix

from XCMS

Large LC—hrMS metabolomics datasets contain unwanted variation
introduced by MS signal drift/attenuation and multiplicative noise
across the dynamic range. These effects can detrimentally impact
biomarker discovery and MS features require rigorous quality assur—
ance. PreProc.QC.LSC first zero—fills data, then if sample normal—
ization is required the median fold change method can also be
applied (Veselkov et al. 2011). PreProc.QC.LSC then uses the QC—
based locally weighted scatter—plot smoothing method to alleviate
the effects of signal drift (Dunn et al. 2011). The degree of smooth—
ing is controlled by the smoother span value (e.g. f: 1/5), this argu—
ment sets the proportion of points used to smooth at each point.
Data are then Log—transformed and finally features analytically sta—
ble across the regularly injected (every 5—10 true sample) pooled
QCs are retained (e.g. RSD : 30, i.e. <30% relative standard
deviation).

2.2 Step 2: Removal of outliers

The next function performs automated removal of outliers in the
pre—processed data based on expansion of the Hotellings T2 distri—
bution ellipse. The argument ‘out.tol’ (outlier tolerance) controls the
proportional expansion of the ellipse (e.g. 1.1 or a 10% propor—
tional expansion). Any samples within the first and second compo—
nent PCA score plot beyond this expanded ellipse are removed
and the PCA model recalculated. Assuming outliers are detected
Auto.PCA performs two rounds of outlier removal and saves details
of outliers removed along with corresponding samples from the
Y—variable data table supplied in the parent directory in .csv format.

Fig. 1. Data acquisition and MetMSLine data processing workflow (Steps
1—4). Sample preparation (e.g. urine dilution) is followed by untargeted MS
and MS/MS data acquisition in sequence and peak picking softwares
MetMSLine then performs sequentially: signal drift correction and pre—pro-
cessing (Step 1), automatic PCA-based outlier removal (Step 2) (sam-
ples:black, QCszred, outlierszgreen), automatic iterative regression
based on continuous Y—variables supplied and cluster ion identification (Step
3) and final identification by data-dependent MS/MS and database matching
(Step 4)

2.3 Step 3: Multivariate regression

Auto.MV.Regress utilizes continuous Y—variables to regress to the
pre—processed MS dataset. Auto.MV.Regress creates a subfolder for
each Y—variable supplied, then identifies potential biomarkers based
on a user—defined correlation threshold (e.g. Corr.thresh: 0.3) and
below a multiple testing corrected P—value (P : 0.01) and both scat—
terplots and box and whisker plots are generated. Potential bio—
markers above the threshold are hierarchically clustered and ‘X—Y’
and ‘X—X’ heatmaps generated. Inter—feature clustering (X—X) is
used to identify cluster ions from a list of 88 isotope, adduct, frag—
ment and co—metabolite mass shifts.

2.4 Step 4 (i): MS/MS matching for biomarker

structure elucidation

As an LC—hrMS platform can acquire MS/MS data with precise
masses, we coded a function to use the MS/MS data for the identifi—
cation of metabolites. This function matches potential biomarkers
identified by Auto.MV.Regress to MS/MS fragmentation spectra
by a retention time window (ret: 10 s) and mass tolerance
(Frag.ppm:20). Auto.MS.MS.matc/7 calculates the precursor (in
blue on plot) to fragment (in red on plot) and inter—fragment mass
differences, and labels where available the neutral losses/fragments
commonly encountered in MS/MS spectra.

2.5 Step 4 (ii): Compound annotation using

exact mass matching

The final function utilizes targeted lists of experiment—specific antici—
pated metabolites (in .csv format) provided by the user to annotate
the unknown biomarkers. DBAmzotate optionally calculates from
the targeted lists of anticipated metabolites, expected m/z of both
typical phase II conjugates and electrospray adducts. DBAmzotate
matches against all iterations of these potential theoretical masses
below user—defined mass tolerances (MassAcc : 10 ppm) and returns
an aggregated result table.

3 Conclusion

MetMSLine presents a complete data processing method; it is easy
to use as a GUI and should be very beneficial to researchers to rap—
idly process large—scale LC—hrMS dataset. It potentially requires
minimal manual interaction with the software, when compared with
the high—manual interaction required by commonly used softwares
for LC—hrMS datasets such as MetaboAnalyst, MAVEN, apLCMS,
MzMine and IDEOM (Yu et al. 2009; Pluskal et al. 2010; Clasquin
et al. 2012; Greek et al. 2012; Xia et al. 2012). The rapidity of the
process allows great scope for parameter optimization and the sub—
sequent ability to dedicate more time to result interpretation.

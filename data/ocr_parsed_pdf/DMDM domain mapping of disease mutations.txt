ABSTRACT

Summary: Domain mapping of disease mutations (DMDM) is a
database in which each disease mutation can be displayed by its
gene, protein or domain location. DMDM provides a unique domain-
level view where all human coding mutations are mapped on the
protein domain. To build DMDM, all human proteins were aligned to
a database of conserved protein domains using a Hidden Markov
Model-based sequence alignment tool (HMMer). The resulting
protein-domain alignments were used to provide a domain location
for all available human disease mutations and polymorphisms. The
number of disease mutations and polymorphisms in each domain
position are displayed alongside other relevant functional information
(e.g. the binding and catalytic activity of the site and the conservation
of that domain location). DMDM’s protein domain view highlights
molecular relationships among mutations from different diseases
that might not be clearly observed with traditional gene-centric
visualization tools.

1 INTRODUCTION

The domain mapping of disease mutations (DMDM) database
provides an aggregated view of all human coding disease-related
mutations and SNPs for each protein domain. Domains are the
structural, functional and evolutionary units of proteins (Holm
and Sander, 1996; Murzin et al., 1995; Orengo et al., 1997).
Most proteins contain multiple domains in a variety of domain
combinations; and different domain combinations are associated
with different protein functions (Bornberg-Bauer et (11., 2005;
Doolittle, 1995; Nikitin and Lisacek, 2003). Thus, the aggregated
view of all human mutations at the domain level is an extremely
useful tool for visualizing the molecular events that lead to diseased
and healthy states in organisms. DMDM will also aid scientists to
generate new hypotheses concerning the role of protein domains in
key complex biological systems.

2 METHODS

HMMer’s semi-global implementation (Eddy, 1996) was used to search for
complete domains in human proteins from the RefSeq (Pruitt at al.. 2007) and
SWISS-PROT (Boeckmann at al.. 2003) databases. Hidden Markov models
for protein domains from SMART (Letunic at al.. 2006), COG (Tatusov at al..

2003), CDD (Marchler-Bauer at al.. 2007) and Pfam (Finn at al.. 2008) were
built using multiple sequence alignments from CDD with the hmmerbui 1d
tool. The human disease mutations and SNPs mapped onto these domains
were extracted from the OMIM (McKusick. 2007). SWISS-PROT and the
dbSNP (Sherry at al.. 2001) databases.

3 DMDM NAVIGATION LAYERS

The data in DMDM can be visualized at three levels: gene, protein
and protein domain. A search within DMDM can be performed at
any of these three levels, or by disease name, using multiple search
options. For instance, users may search by description, which is
useful when only a keyword about the molecular entity is known,
or by any gene or protein identiﬁer. The results of the search in
any of the layers consist of a summary of the information at the
top of the page that includes a description, identiﬁers and external
links to the gene, protein or domain. The summary is followed by
either a graphical display of the information and/or tables of domain
and mutational information, with key identiﬁers and relevant links.
Proteins, both in the gene and protein layers, are depicted as a
scaled bar that indicates the amino acid positions; the corresponding
domains are shown below the bar. By selecting a region of the
protein, information and links about the subset of mutations found
around that region are displayed on a separate page along with a
graphical display of each mutation.

The domain layer, an example of which is illustrated in Figure 1,
displays three levels of information: sequence logos, mutational data
and conserved functional features/sites for each domain position.
Multiple sequence alignment information, obtained from CDD for
each conserved domain model, is displayed using sequence logos
[WebLogo software (Crooks et (11., 2004)]. Mutational data for
each human protein with one or more domains is represented
by histograms under each position on the sequence logo. The
third level, which was extracted from the CDD manual annotation
and which is displayed below the histogram bars, provides the
functional information for each domain position. The height of
the histogram’s bars represents the number of mutations found
at individual domain positions for all human proteins that match
that domain. Polymorphisms are represented in blue and disease
mutations in red.

Redundant mutations that share location, amino acid types and
gene, but that are in different proteins are counted only once.
When selecting a position on the histogram bar, a list of all
mutations in that position, including redundancies, are displayed
on a separate page. The upper left boxes in domain pages can
be used to locate a particular protein position in the display. The
check boxes provide control over the display of ﬁinctional features
shown for each domain position. The histogram bars provide a

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

The DMDM database is an online resource created for displaying
human mutations with other relevant ﬁinctional information at the

protein domain level. This domain-centric database provides an
ideal framework for studying biological processes relevant to human
health, as well as for the integration of other molecular events, such
as protein translational modiﬁcations and alternative splicing events
affecting protein domains. Updates to DMDM will be performed
every six months. In the future, DMDM will be expanded to map
and integrate additional experimental data from the next generation
of sequence, gene expression and proteomic experiments.

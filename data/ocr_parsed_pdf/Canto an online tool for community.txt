conditions. Finally, annotations can be transferred from one
gene to another, streamlining the curation process. Because an—
notations are made using precise ontology terms without free
text input, format and syntax errors are avoided. Users can,
however, provide comments pertaining to individual annotations
or to the whole article.

2.2 Interaction curation

In addition to assigning ontology terms to genes, users can curate
genetic and physical interactions. Starting from one gene, the
user selects an interaction type (physical or genetic), an interact—
ing gene and an experiment type. Canto is configured to use
BioGRID experiment types by default (Chatr—Aryamontri
et al., 2013).

2.3 Literature and curation management

Canto includes an administrator interface that supports litera—
ture— and curation—management tasks. Papers are retrieved from
PubMed according to administrator—speciﬁed criteria, such as
organism or publication date. Administrators can then use the
literature triage function to classify papers by type (e.g. curata—
ble, review, methods) and prioritize for curation. Administrators
can select and curate papers, or invite authors to curate publica—
tions. Users can also select their own papers for curation via a
publication search. Administrators can monitor curation pro—
gress, amend annotations in any active session and ﬂag curation
sessions as approved for public release.

3 METHODS

Canto is implemented in Perl using the Catalyst web framework
and other widely used Perl packages, and has been engineered to
ensure that new annotation types can be added easily. In its
standard mode of operation, Canto has no external dependen—
cies, although it can be conﬁgured to use web services to retrieve
gene and publication details. All data is stored locally using the
SQLite library. A CLucene (http://clucene.sourceforge.net/)
index of ontology term names and synonyms supplies sugges—
tions to the search autocomplete feature. A small amount of
Javascript is used on the browser side to make the application
more responsive.

Canto can export in J SON format for loading into databases
that use the Chado schema (Mungall et al., 2007), or for archiv—
ing or other applications. Curated GO data can be exported in
Gene Association File format (Balakrishnan et al., 2013).

4 CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS

The original implementation of Canto supports community cur—
ation for Spombe literature, as part of the PomBase project.
Because many aspects of Canto, such as supported ontologies,
and gene/gene product identiﬁers, are fully conflgurable, Canto

can be easily deployed for other organisms, with or without a
dedicated organism—specif1c database. We have set up two
additional Canto installations, illustrating its flexibility. In a spe—
cies—specif1c example, literature triage for the yeast Komagataella
pastoris (formerly Pichia pastoris) has been completed, and an—
notation is planned (D. Dikicioglu et al., manuscript in prepar—
ation). A species—independent version of Canto supports GO
annotation using UniProtKB protein accessions. Current
Canto installations, including a demonstration tool, are access—
ible on the Canto home page (http://curation.pombase.org/).

5 FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Canto will be enhanced to support ontology subsets, taxon
restrictions (Deegan et al., 2010) and annotation extensions
(R.P. Huntley et al., manuscript in preparation). We will also
incorporate semantic checks for logical consistency and compre—
hensive annotation. To improve efﬁciency, we will enable Canto
to link to TermGenie (http://termgenie.org; H. Dietze et al.,
manuscript in preparation), which streamlines the creation of
new GO terms. To increase interoperability, we plan to provide
functionality to export to GPAD (The Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2013) and other useful formats as needed.

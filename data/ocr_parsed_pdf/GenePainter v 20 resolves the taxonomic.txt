Abstract

Summary: Conserved intron positions in eukaryotic genes can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic
trees, to resolve ambiguous subfamily relationships in protein families and to infer the history of
gene families. This version of GenePainter facilitates working with large datasets through options
to select specific subsets for analysis and visualization, and through providing exhaustive statistics.
GenePainter’s application in phylogenetic analyses is considerably extended by the newly imple—
mented integration ofthe exon—intron pattern conservation with phylogenetic trees.

Availability and implementation: The software along with detailed documentation is available at
http://www.motorprotein.de/genepainter and as Supplementary Material.

1 Introduction

The rapid growth of sequenced eukaryotes increasingly allows
incorporating exon—intron pattern information into phylogenetic
analyses. Conserved intron positions have helped resolving the rela-
tionship of taxonomic lineages (Grewe et (11., 2013; Lehmann et (11.,
2013) and have also extensively been used to reveal subfamily rela-
tionships within larger gene families (Du et (11., 2013; Yan et (11.,
2014) and to reconstruct ancient genes (Odronitz and Kollmar,
2008). Because the early eukaryotes were rather intron rich and the
gene structure evolution towards the extant species was dominated
by intron-loss events (Koonin et (11., 2013), considerable taxonomic
and sequence sampling is necessary to reconstruct the gene structure
history of a gene or gene family across the eukaryotic tree of life.
For example, mammals and plants are known to have intron-rich
genomes, while most unicellular organisms are intron poor.
However, although the yeast Sacclmromyces germ/£52216 is known to
contain only ~275 introns in total (Lopez and Séraphin, 2000), the
yeast’s dynein light chain LCS coding region is split by two introns
(other ascomycetous fungi contain even up to seven introns) while
the human LCS orthologs only contain a single intron. In general,
intron gain events are rare and are most often recent events (Li

et (11., 2009). Existing tools for the comparison of gene structures
like Exalign (Pavesi et (11., 2008), CIDA/CIWOG (Wilkerson et (11.,
2009), GECA (Fawal et (11., 2012) and GenePainter (Hammesfahr
et (11., 2013) compare exon lengths or map intron positions to pos-
itions in multiple amino acid sequence alignments (MSA). However,
none of the tools integrates gene structure conservation with taxo-
nomic and phylogenetic tree information. Here, we present a new
version of our GenePainter software, v. 2.0, which maps intron pos-
itions onto the multiple sequence alignment and assigns intron gain
and loss events to taxonomic branches and extant species.

2 Features

2.1 Input files

The most accurate way to compare gene structures is to align the in-
tron positions based on corresponding protein sequence alignments
(Hammesfahr et (11., 2013). GenePainter therefore requires a protein
MSA (fasta format) and corresponding gene structures (YAML or
GFF v. 3 format). For phylogenetic analyses, GenePainter by default
uses the NCBI taxonomy tree as reference tree (Federhen, 2012) but
user-provided trees can also be employed.

non—ﬂowering to the ﬂowering state. Davidich and Bornholdt
(2008) and Li et al. (2004) used a Boolean network model and
its steady states to describe the different stages in yeast cell cycle,
where the stages of the cycle correspond to the strong attractors
of the network. Kaufman et al. (1985) explained the various
states of the immune system with Boolean network models and
Albert and Othmer (2003); Gonzalez et al. (2008) and Sanchez
and Thieffry (2001) used Boolean network models and their
attractors to describe the cellular development of Drosophila
melanogaster.

Key to simulating GRNs with Boolean network models is the
choice of the proper assumptions. These assumptions refer to the
activation rules and update scheme. Activation rules determine
the way the activation state of each gene depends on the activa—
tion states of its interactors in the previous transition step.
The update scheme determines how these activation states are
updated, i.e. either synchronously or asynchronously. The exact
choice of these assumptions largely determines the number and
characteristics of the attractors. As in most cases, the true bio—
logical activation rules and update scheme are not known, one
should be able to easily test different activation rules and
schemes, as this allows to have an idea on the conditions
under which the simulated network model would be able to cap—
ture an observed biological phenomenon (boundary conditions).

Several computational tools have been developed to perform
the computation of attractors in Boolean network models. Garg
et al. (2007) developed geanis, which uses techniques involving
binary decision diagrams (BDD) to compute attractors. Arellano
et al. (2011) used techniques based on Temporal Logic model
checking in Antelope. Ay et al. (2009) used state space pruning
and randomized state space traversal methods to improve the
scalability of the attractor computation. Dubrova and
Teslenko (2011) used a Boolean Satisﬁability (SAT) solver, typ—
ically used for combinatorial modeling and problem solving, to
compute attractors of GRNs and obtained a better computa—
tional time and space efﬁciency compared with the BDD—based
approach. More recently, Zheng et al. (2013) developed geneFatt
based on the reduced—order BDD (ROBDD) data structure,
which further improves the efﬁciency of the attractor
computation.

Most of the aforementioned systems to simulate Boolean net—
work models in principle can perform simulations with different
assumptions. However, changing these assumptions would
require tedious modiﬁcations on these systems. For instance,
using the SAT approach (Dubrova and Teslenko, 2011), mod—
ifying the structure of the network and the updating rules would
require updating the truth tables in the cnet format.

To allow for a more ﬂexible simulation framework, we de—
veloped ASP—G, which makes use of the declarative program—
ming paradigm Answer Set Programming (ASP; Lifschitz, 2008).
The declarative nature of ASP allows one to specify and modify
the domain—speciﬁc logic (here the deﬁnition of the network
interactions, activation rules and update schemes) required to
represent and solve the computational problem at hand (here
dynamical modeling and attractor calculation) in an intuitive
and modular way (Eiter et al., 2009). To illustrate the ﬂexibility
of our approach, we applied it to calculate attractors of previ—
ously published Boolean network models of GRNs of different
sizes and complexity, and different simulation assumptions. By

trying to mimic previous results under diverse settings, we can
show that the main advantage of our approach consists of
making the modeling more ﬂexible and less error—prone, and
therefore helps delineate the boundary conditions under which
the biological conclusions based on simulations of Boolean net—
work models are valid. At the same time, we also show that, with
the use of fast and efﬁcient ASP solvers, the computational effi—
ciency of our method is in the same range as that of the most
efﬁcient dedicated methods for the simulation of Boolean net—
work models and the calculation of their attractors.

2 METHODS AND MODELS
2.1 Boolean network modeling of GRNs

In our work, we adopt the deﬁnition of Boolean networks as described in
Kauffman (1993): a Boolean network model consists of network elements
(nodes, here representing structural and regulatory genes/proteins), which
can either be active (ON) or inactive (OFF), and interactions between
these elements (edges, which represent the directed regulatory interactions
between the genes). We deﬁne two types of regulatory interactions be-
tween interacting nodes, i.e. activation (upregulation) and inhibition
(downregulation). The activation state of a certain node at a certain
time step is determined by a logical function of the activation states at
the previous time step of its interactors (where the interactors of a node
are deﬁned as the incoming edges of a certain network node).

Formally, a Boolean network model G( V, F) is deﬁned by a set of
nodes V={X1, . . .,X,,} and a list of Boolean functions F=(f1, . . .,f,,).
Each X,» e {0, l}, i=1,...,n is a binary variable and its value at time
t + 1 can be determined by the values of some other nodes lem, Xhm, . . .
,Xjkfm at time t by means of a Boolean function f,» e F. That is, there are
k,- nodes assigned to X,- that determine its state. The activation state of
every node X,- changes over time according to

Xi(l + 1) =fi(le<i>(t)~ ij<i>(l)~ - - - v thf<i>(l))

A state s of a Boolean network is an assignment of {0, l} to each node Xi.
Its successor state is the state resulting of applying f,- to each node X,-. The
dynamics of the network consists of transitions between network states.
An example of a Boolean network is given in Figure 1. This network has
three nodes, denoted by X1, X2 and X3, and interactions between these
nodes, represented by the edges. The dynamics of the network can be
described using a state-transition graph (STG) as given in the
Supplementary Figure S1.

Attractors in a Boolean network model are deﬁned as in Ay et al.
(2009) and Garg et al. (2007).

DEFINITION 1. Let S be a set of states of a Boolean network model. S is an
attractor  and only  the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) The set of the successor states of all the states in S is equal to S.

(2) For each s,» e S, once it is visited, the probability ofrevisiting s,- in a
finite number of state transitions is equal to 1.

2.2 Representing Boolean network models of GRNs and
computing their attractors using ASP

ASP-G framework

Our framework for modeling GRNs and computing attractors, called
ASP-G, uses ASP. ASP is a declarative programming paradigm
(Lifschitz, 2008), which is typically used to solve combinatorial search
problems (Eiter et al., 2009). The architecture of ASP-G is shown in
Figure 2. ASP-G consists of four main modules/parts of the system: the
network description, the update scheme, the activation rules and the

are made, and genes may be updated at different time steps. Therefore,
transitions are non-deterministic: there may be several possible next states
after a certain transition. As illustrated in the Supplementary Figures S1
and S2, an asynchronous update scheme can result in a drastically dif-
ferent STG and can lead to different attractors.

Both the synchronous and the asynchronous updating were imple-
mented in ASP-G. For the synchronous update scheme, we use the fol-
lowing rules to generate initial activation states of the genes:

active(X, 0) <— gene(X), not inhibited(X, 0).
inhibited(X, 0) <— gene(X), not active(X, 0).
We then use the following rules (in relation with the activation rules
described previously) to determine the activation state of each gene at
each time step t:
active(X, t) <—
inhibited(X, t) <—

active(X, t — 1), not inhibited(X, t).
inhibited(X, t — 1), not active(X, t).

For the asynchronous update scheme, we need to add the following
rules, in addition to the previously described rules:

changed(X, T) <— active(X, T), inhibited(X, T— l),

gene(X), T>0.
changed(X, T) <— inhibited(X, T), active(X, T— l),
gene(X), T>0.
<— #changed(N, X, T). N Z 2,
gene(X), T>0.

To obtain a better performance in the asynchronous case, we apply the
STG reduction technique, as explained in the Supplementary Figure S2.

Computing the attractors

The attractor computation in ASP-G is performed by Algorithm 1, which
is based on the algorithm by Dubrova and Teslenko (2011). The main
idea used in Algorithm 1 is to identify attractors by looking at identical
states in transition paths of certain lengths in the STG of the network.
Because there are exponentially many possible states in an STG (in rela-
tion to the number of nodes in the network), explicit enumeration of all
the states in an STG is unfeasible for larger networks. ASP-G avoids this
explicit enumeration by implicitly simulating the dynamics of the net-
work. Furthermore, once a state is identiﬁed as part of an attractor, it
can be removed from the STG to prune the search space. An illustration
on how the algorithm works is given in Supplementary Figure S4. Path
generation and state removal are being done using ASP rules and ASP
constraints, respectively, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. To fur-
ther increase the efﬁciency of the computation, we use the incremental
ASP approach described in Gebser et al. (2008) and the clasp solver from
the Potassco ASP suite (Gebser et al., 201 lb).

3 RESULTS

3.1 ASP-G: a novel framework for the simulation and
attractor computation of GRNs with Boolean network
models

Simulating Boolean network models implies that activation rules
have to be deﬁned to decide how a gene is activated by its inter—
actors. The exact choice of the assumptions largely determines
the outcome and the number and characteristics of the attractors.
Supplementary Figures S17S3 show that, for example, Boolean
network in Figure 1, the choices of activation rules and update
scheme can result in a different network behavior and thus dif—
ferent sets of attractors. As it is often not known in advance
which assumptions best match the biological reality of the mod—
eled GRN, testing different assumptions is advisable.

To have a generic framework that allows testing different as—
sumptions, ASP—G implements three different activation rules:
the first one adopted by Ay et al. (2009); Davidich and
Bornholdt (2008) and Li et al. (2004)in which a gene is con—
sidered to be activated if the majority of its active incoming
interactors (interactors that are themselves active) have an acti—
vating role. Otherwise, the gene will become inactive. This is
referred to as the r* rule in ASP—G. A second one adopted by
Garg et al. (2007) and Pedicini et al. (2010) assumes that a gene is
activated only when there is at least one active activator among
its active incoming interactors and no inhibitor. This is referred
to as the r+ rule in ASP—G. In addition, we implemented a third
more detailed activation rule in which the activation for each
gene is expressed as a free—form Boolean function of its activators
and inhibitors. These types of rules better grasp the complexity of
true biological interactions and include more detailed informa—
tion on the speciﬁcs of the interactions. It was used, for instance,
in Albert and Othmer (2003); Gonzalez et al. (2008) and
Sanchez—Corrales et al. (2010).

Related to the update scheme, a choice has to be made be—
tween updating the network elements simultaneously (synchron—
ously) versus at different points (asynchronously). Earlier work
by Kauffman (1993) and Thomas (1973) assumed synchronicity
in their modeling, mainly because of computational efﬁciency
reasons. However, the assumption of synchronicity was chal—
lenged in Harvey and Bossomaier (1997) and Thomas (1991),
who argued that, for many biological systems, assuming an asyn—
chronous update scheme is more realistic. Subsequent work on
Boolean network models (Ay et al., 2009; Garg et al., 2007, 2008;
Gonzalez et al., 2008 and Naldi et al., 2007) mainly applied
asynchronous update schemes. Therefore, in ASP—G we

implemented both the synchronous and the asynchronous
update scheme.

3.2 Simulation results

To test the correctness of ASP—G in simulating Boolean network
models and computing attractors, we applied ASP—G on previ—
ously published Boolean network models of GRNs and com—
pared the obtained attractors with the originally published
ones. Like any other formalism to find attractors in Boolean
network models, ASP—G detects exhaustively all attractors of
the network. Therefore, a correct result corresponds to an
exact match in the attractor set identiﬁed by ASP—G and that
present in the reference publications.

First, we tested ASP—G on the relatively small GRNs involved
in budding and ﬁssion yeast cell cycle analyzed in Ay et al.
(2009); Davidich and Bornholdt (2008) and Li et al. (2004), as
well as on the network model of the GRN from the T—helper (Th)
cell differentiation described in Garg et al. (2007). We used the
activation rules and update schemes that were also applied in the
original studies, except for the dataset of Garg et al. (2007), in
which we applied also the synchronous update scheme in add—
ition to the originally applied asynchronous one (Table 1).

As expected for each of these results, the attractors found by
ASP—G match exactly the ones found by the reference papers
(data not shown). The table also shows that ASP—G performs
relatively fast for these small networks. We also observe that the
attractors in the synchronous case often coincide with those in
the asynchronous case. This is because of the fact that simple
attractors (i.e. attractors that have only one state) are more com—
monly found, and that they are shared between synchronous and
asynchronous update schemes. Only for the ﬁssion yeast cell
network under the r* activation rules there is a difference in
the number of synchronous attractors (13) and asynchronous
attractors (15). The fact that there are more attractors in the
asynchronous case might seem counter—intuitive, as the reduced
STG used to calculate these attractors contains at most as many
nodes as the synchronous STG, and often less. However, the
original STG for the asynchronous case typically contains
more edges than in the synchronous case, and these additional
edges can account for more attractors.

To show the ﬂexibility of ASP—G in expressing different types
of activation rules, we also encoded the Boolean network model

of the GRN involved in A.thaliana ﬂower development originally
described in Sanchez—Corrales et al. (2010), with our ASP—G
framework. This network model consists of 13 genes and uses
gene—specific update rules as described in Section 2.2 Activation
rules. As in the original publication, we applied a synchronous
update scheme. ASP—G correctly recapitulated all 10 attractors of
the network as described in the original paper Sanchez—Corrales
et al. (2010). The computation took only 0.479 s.

To test ASP—G on a larger network, we use the network data
from the Th cell differentiation described by Pedicini et al.
(2010). The purpose of the study was to ﬁnd evidence supporting
(or contradicting) the traditional view that the genes involved in
the regulation of the two types of Th cells, Th1 and Th2, have
counter—regulatory interaction. Similar to what has been done in
Pedicini et al. (2010), we first computed the attractors of the
original network in the presence of all genes and then searched
for attractors in different single—gene knockout networks in silico
to test the effect of knocking out intracellular genes toward the
attractors of the network. To show the added value of using
different simulation assumptions, we also performed the compu—
tations using an asynchronous update mechanism, as opposed to
only synchronous update scheme, as performed by Pedicini et al.
(2010). The results are presented in the Supplementary Table S6.

In terms of computational efﬁciency, the result shows that
ASP—G is able to perform relatively well for the moderately
sized Th cell network. For the asynchronous case, attractor com—
putation required 0.6 s on average. For the synchronous case
where more attractors were found, the computation times took
71.9s on average. When applying the synchronous update
scheme as used in Pedicini et al. (2010), ASP—G reproduced the
four attractors: Th0, Th1, Th2 and ThX, as in the original paper.
However, when trying to reproduce the attractors in the gene
knockout setting, we found discrepancies with the results re—
ported by Pedicini et al. (2010). These discrepancies were
caused by mistakes in the SAT—based truth table used in the
original publication. Supplementary Table S6 shows the cor—
rected results for completeness. Note that these mistakes do
not affect the biological conclusions made in the original publi—
cation. However, it illustrates that specifying larger networks
with rather complicated behavior becomes cumbersome and
error—prone in paradigms like SAT, whereas this is much less
the case for a declarative approach such as ASP—G.

ASP-G

 

The existence of the ThX attractor and the observed pattern of
gene activities in the attractors of the knockout networks caused
the authors of Pedicini et al. (2010) to conclude that the active
genes in Th1 and Th2 cells do not play counter—regulatory roles
with each other, contrary to what is traditionally believed.
However, when using the asynchronous update scheme, we
noted that the attractor ThX is no longer obtained. A similar
pattern occurs for the knockout networks, where the use of the
asynchronous update scheme drastically changes the set of
detected attractors compared with those detected using a syn—
chronous update scheme: the number of attractors found with
the asynchronous update scheme for the knockout networks
ranges only between 2 and 5, whereas the number of attractors
found in the synchronous case ranged between 286 and 1154.
This ﬁnding suggests that the occurrence of the ThX attractor
and the existence of a large number of attractors in the knockout
networks as found in Pedicini et al. (2010) are only valid under
the synchronous update scheme. It thus deﬁnes the boundary
conditions under which the conclusions of Pedicini et al. (2010)
are valid and highlights the relevance of performing modeling
under different scenarios, as offered by ASP—G, to put biological
conclusions in perspective.

4 CONCLUSON

In this article, we presented ASP—G, a modular system to simu—
late Boolean network models of GRNs and to subsequently com—
pute their attractors. ASP—G is based on the declarative ASP
programming paradigm, which has already been previously
applied in the context of biological network data analysis and
modeling (see, e.g. Corblin et al., 2012; Dworschak et al., 2008;
Gebser et al., 2008, 2010a and b, 2011). Recently, Inoue (2011)
showed in a theoretical comparison between Boolean networks
and the underlying semantics of ASP, that a strong mathematical
relation exists between the attractors/steady states of Boolean
networks and the notion of stable models commonly used in
ASP. We built on this earlier result in our proposed method,
ASP-G.

The main added value of ASP—G is in its declarativity and
modularity: it allows users to easily test different update schemes
and activation rules when simulating the dynamics of their
Boolean network model by selecting and modifying the appro—
priate modules. In addition, the fact that ASP—G is based on
a declarative language makes it less error—prone than other
approaches such as SAT, which depend on the definition of dif—
ﬁcult to interpret and tedious to construct truth tables. Using an
underlying declarative programming paradigm also makes ASP—
G easily extendable to other parameter settings. Decoupling the
problem deﬁnition from its solution thus allows for a greater
ﬂexibility compared with other ad hoc systems such as geanis
(Garg et al., 2007) and geneFAtt (Zheng et al., 2013), where
assumptions such as update scheme and activation rules are al—
ready built into the system.

We showed the correctness of ASP—G in simulating Boolean
network models and obtaining attractors under different as—
sumptions by successfully recapitulating the detection of attrac—
tors of previously published studies. Relying on a modular and
ﬂexible declarative programming paradigm deﬁnitely comes at
the expense of being slower than the more dedicated systems to

compute attractors, such as geanis (Garg et al., 2007) and
geneFAtt (Zheng et al., 2013). However, in terms of computa—
tional efﬁciency, ASP—G proved to be fast (for small networks,
i.e. up to 23 genes, computations are below a second, for larger
networks, i.e. up to 51 genes, the longest computation time took
<4.5 min). Also, ongoing research in ASP solvers (Gebser et al.,
2011a) will make it possible for ASP to reach a point where it
outperforms other logic paradigms. This is deﬁnitely the case
when comparing ASP with Binary (or multiple) decision dia—
grams (Lee, 1959) used to calculate attractors in Boolean
Networks models for GRNs (Arellano et al., 2011; Naldi et al.,
2007) as they suffer from memory explosion when the size of the
network starts to become large (Clarke et al., 2001).

For larger—sized networks, any exhaustive method will face a
challenge, as the state space of the network increases exponen—
tially with respect to the number of nodes in the network. When
dealing with such larger networks, methods that avoid an ex—
haustive search as in Ay et al. (2009) might become more suitable
under these conditions. Conclusively, ASP—G is tailored to simu—
late Boolean network models of GRNs and to compute attrac—
tors in a diagnostic mode, where one wants to test different
update schemes and activation rules to ﬁnd the setting that
best matches experimental data or to correctly delineate the
boundary conditions under which the biological conclusions
based on these simulations are valid.

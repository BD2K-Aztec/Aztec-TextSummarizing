ABSTRACT

Motivation: Modern experimental methods provide substantial
information on protein—DNA recognition. Studying arrangements of
transcription factor binding sites (T FBSs) of interacting transcription
factors (T Fs) advances understanding of the transcription regulatory
code.

Results: We constructed binding motifs for TFs forming a complex
with HlF-1ot at the erythropoietin 3’-enhancer. Corresponding TFBSs
were predicted in the segments around transcription start sites
(TSSs) of all human genes. Using the genome-wide set of regulatory
regions, we observed several strongly preferred distances between
hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) and binding sites of a particular
cofactor protein. The set of preferred distances was called as
a preferred pair distance template (PPDT). PPDT dramatically
depended on the TF and orientation of its binding sites relative
to HRE. PPDT evaluated from the genome-wide set of regulatory
sequences was used to detect significant PPDT-consistent binding
site pairs in regulatory regions of hypoxia-responsive genes. We
believe PPDT can help to reveal the layout of eukaryotic regulatory
segments.

1 INTRODUCTION

The regulatory code controlling gene expression in higher
eukaryotes still remains elusive. It is challenging to understand how
a 1D DNA text directs formation of the protein complex that controls
gene expression in a particular cell type in speciﬁc conditions. Some
insight is gained by using the well-known concept of ‘composite
elements’ consisting of binding sites for different regulatory proteins
separated by speciﬁc distances (Matys et al., 2006). Despite more
than 15 years of study, information about the scale and speciﬁcity
of possible distances between binding sites remains insufﬁcient.

New technologies like ChIP-Seq have dramatically increased the
quality of identiﬁcation of TFBSs, both in vitro and in vivo. Recently,
it was shown (Shelest et al., 2010; Yokoyama et al., 2009) that in
some cases there are several preferred distances between binding
sites of some TFs. Here, we illustrate that distance preferences
themselves are extremely well exhibited and that this phenomenon
appears to be much more common, at least in the case of Homo
sapiens TFs involved in regulating responses for hypoxic conditions.

We studied distributions of distances between TFBSs identiﬁed
in silico for TFs involved in known protein—protein interactions.
As a case study, we took TFs participating in the regulation of the
erithropoetin (EPO) gene expression in hypoxia response in human
cells.

2 METHODS

Data used in the study: for our analysis. we used the UCSC human
genome annotation (hg18). The genome-wide set of regulatory sequences
was constructed by taking segments of 3000 bp centered at transcription start
sites (TSSs) for all annotated genes. For closely located TSSs. we merged
together corresponding regulatory segments if they overlapped for >50%
(resulting in a total of 36 271 segments). The hypoxia-regulated set consisted
of 3000 bp long regulatory sequences for known hypoxia-dependent genes
(Ortiz-Barahona et al.. 2010) (158 sequences total. centered at TSS and
merged if overlapping for >50%). The masked genome set was created
from the genome-wide set by substituting exons. repBase repeats and fuzzy
tandem repeats (Boeva et al.. 2006) for poly-N sequences. An additional set
of sequences demonstrating a low level of transcription (the low-transcription
set) was built using CAGE-tag depleted regions (a total of 70 955 non-
overlapping 3000 bp regions) based on FANTOM4 data (Kawaji et al.. 2009)
(see details in Section 1 in Supplementary Material).

We constructed the binding motifs in the form of positional weight
matrices (PWMS) (Stormo. 2000) for the HlF-lOlZARNT dimer. HNF4ot.
SMAD3. SMAD4. p300 and Spl transcription factors (TFs) forming a

dimer binding motif [known as the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE)]. we
used human-curated binding site data from Ortiz-Barahona et al. (2010)
and from the SITE table of the TRANSFAC database (Matys et al.. 2006).
as well as ChlP-chip data published in Xia and Kung (2009). PWM was
created using the ChIPMunk tool (Kulakovskiy et al.. 2010). For the sake
of consistency. we did not use TRANSFAC motifs for other TFs as well.
but created original PWMS from binding sites stored in the TRANSFAC

Spacer Length

Fig. 1. The PPDD and PPDT peaks for the HREeSMAD4 binding site pair.
PPDDs from three different sequence sets are shown. The Y-axis displays the
number of sequences (taking both strands of each segment independently) in
the set having a pair of sites separated by the selected spacer (at the X -axis).
HRE is located at zero X. see details in text). The shufﬂed genome-wide set
was constructed by shufﬂing letters in the sequences from the genome-wide
set so that only the base composition was preserved. Motif logos correspond
to the PWMs and binding site orientation.

SITE table (see details in Section 2 in Supplementary Material). Sequence
segments having PWM scores above a preselected threshold. were adopted
as motif occurrences (Stormo. 2000). For a given threshold one can calculate
the motif P-Value. the probability that a random word has a PWM score no
less than a given threshold. This P-Value was calculated using the AhoPro
tool (Boeva et al.. 2007). For each motif. we selected a PWM threshold in
such a way that the corresponding motif P-Value was equal to 10—3 (if not
stated otherwise). The motif logos are presented in Supplementary Figure 1.

The 2400 bp long DNA segments centered at TSS were used to search
for occurrences of the HRE motif. the principle DNA element controlling
hypoxia response. The 600 bp windows centered at each putative HRE were
used to search for occurrences of binding motifs for TFs operating as HIF-lot
cofactors.

Preferred pair distance distributions: to evaluate preferred distances
between the HRE and cofactor binding sites. we used a strategy similar to that
described in Kulakovskiy et al. (2011). Essentially. for each spacer length
from —300 to 300. we counted the number of sequences having a binding
site of the selected TF located in a given orientation at a selected distance
from the HRE. In other words for a selected orientation of the cofactor
binding site relative to HRE. we counted the number of sequences having an
‘HRE-cofactor binding site” pair separated by a spacer of the selected length.
Negative/positive spacer values refer to upstream/downstream location of
the cofactor binding site relative to the HRE. Both strands of each sequence
were examined independently. Our strategy has two advantages. First. the
genome sequence set provides a statistically representative set of possible
distances between TFBSs. Second. when one counts the number of sequences
containing at least one pair of TFBS. rather than the total number of pairs
of TFBSs aggregated from all sequences. the result becomes relatively
undistorted by contributions from homotypic TFBS clusters (Gotea et al..
2010; Lifanov et al.. 2003) and repetitive DNA regions.

The corresponding preferred pair distance distribution (PPDD) for the
‘HRE-SMAD4’ pairs is given in Figure 1. It displays a somewhat noisy
background with a set of markedly exhibited peaks at a number of selected
distances. It is noteworthy that the masked genome set shows a very similar
distribution of peaks in PPDD. Supplementary Figures 24 show genome-
wide PPDDs for pairs formed by HRE and binding sites of HIF-lot cofactors
for all cofactors considered in this study.

Preferred pair distance templates: Figure 1 displays preferred distances
forming a comb of well-deﬁned peaks. Additionally. the PPDD curve exhibits
a general trend. decreasing from center to edge. The signiﬁcance of this
trend depends on the motif lengths. PWMs and PWM thresholds. and the
nucleotide composition of sequence segments in the set. It is noteworthy
that the principle peaks are usually much less sensitive to changes in motif
model parameters (Supplementary Fig. 6 and 7) and to the sequence set
used (Supplementary Fig. 9). Thus. a peak extraction procedure was needed
to distinguish signiﬁcant peaks from the variable background. We did this
by identifying extreme points of the numerical derivative averaged over
three-points (using PPDD with an llbp-sliding window baseline correction).
Peaks having both the derivative and the baseline values higher than their
mean + SD were selected. Then we extracted the set of positions covered by
signiﬁcant PPDD peaks and called it the Preferred Pair Distance Template
(PPDT). PPDT refers to the set of valid intersite distances (i.e. preferred
spacers) for a selected pair of TFs in a given orientation. Supplementary
Figures 2 and 3 and Supplementary Table 1 show PPDDs and corresponding
PPDTs for HREecofactor binding site pairs.

Assessing relevance of PPDT-consistent binding site pairs: to test whether
PPDT is related to functional TFBS arrangements. we used the sequence set
containing regulatory regions of hypoxia-dependent genes.

Suppose we have selected a cofactor TFBS and its orientation relative
to HRE. For each sequence. we independently counted the total number. n.
of ‘HRE-cofactor TF binding site” pairs within 600 bp windows centered at
HRE. and the number of such pairs having a spacer corresponding to one of
the PPDT distances. k. We selected subsets from the genome-wide set and the
hypoxia-regulated set containing sequences having n above zero (i.e. having
at least one HREwofactor TFBS pair at any distance within 600 bp HRE-
centered windows). Let Ng be the size of the genome-wide ‘n>0’-subset
of sequences and M, be the size of the hypoxia-regulated ‘n> 0’-subset of
sequences.

Using PPDT constructed from the genome-wide dataset. we evaluated
the enrichment of pairs of HRE and its cofactor TFBS located at any of the
PPDT-consistent distances in the hypoxia-regulated set. To this end. for a
given threshold t for each set we counted the number of sequences having
k /n ratio no less than the threshold (denoted as C], and CIS. for the hypoxia-
regulated set and the genome-wide set respectively). Let us assume that in the
genome-wide set. sequences with different k and n are found at random. The
probability Pk/n to pick a sequence at random having k / n 3 t is estimated as
Pk/n = C g / Ng. Adopting the null hypothesis that the set of hypoxia-regulated
sequences have a similar enrichment with PPDT-consistent distances as the
genome-wide dataset. one can calculate the probability to draw Nh sequences
having at least Ch sequences satisfying k/nZt condition by chance. This
value can be calculated with the help of the binomial distribution. The
binomial distribution B(l,s,p) is the discrete probability of having exactly
s successes (‘yes’ answers) in a series 1 independent binary (‘yes’/ ‘no’)
trials. each of which can yield a success with the given probability P. With
the help of this distribution. the k/n ratio P-Value of having at least Ch
sequences with k/n Z t from M, writes as:

P-Value: l — EiB(Nh, i, Pk/n), i=0..Ch —l

3 RESULTS

Hypoxia-regulated set is enriched with PPDT-consistent binding site
pairs: Figure 2 shows k/n ratio P-values for the pairs of HRE—
HRE and HRE—Spl binding sites estimated using genome-wide
PPDTs. Supplementary Figure 5 display similar graphs for HRE and
other cofactor binding sites in different orientations. Better (lower)
P-values are exhibited for small k /n threshold levels. Speciﬁcally
this means that regulatory regions of hypoxia-dependent genes often
exhibit at least one PPDT-consistent pair of HRE—cofactor TFBS.
The k/n ratio test demonstrated that positioning of the following
TFBS pairs can be used to distinguish the hypoxia-regulated set from

the genome-wide set: HRE-p300 (direct orientation), HRE—HRE
(direct orientation), HRE—Spl (both orientations), HRE—SMAD3
(reverse orientation). Preferred locations of other TFBS pairs
were not exhibited in the hypoxia-regulated gene set, which may
indicate that the binding of these TFs in such an orientation is not
characteristic for regulation of hypoxia response or that in this case
TF binding pattern is so complex that it cannot be easily recovered
with the help of HRE-centered PPDTs.

Intersite distance preferences are stable and prevalent: PPDDs
are obviously sensitive to motif modiﬁcations or changes of PWM
score threshold. Still, general patterns of distance preferences are
quite stable and seem not to be a speciﬁc feature of the particular
model for the HRE or another TFBS. Supplementary Figure 6
shows the HRE—HRE and HRE—Spl PPDDs for different motif
thresholds. Supplementary Figure 7 shows the comparison for
PPDDs obtained for TRANSFAC PWMs and our PWMs constructed
with ChIPMunk. Supplementary Figure 8 shows genome-wide
PPDDs centered at Spl binding sites instead of HRE used as the
anchoring element elsewhere in this article.

Mystery of low-transcription regions: in fact, HIF- lot can regulate
hundreds of genes (Mole et al., 2009). Different studies report
dramatically different sets of HIFla targets (see e.g. Venn diagram
in Fig. 2 in Ortiz-Barahona et al., 2010). Since we could not reliably
guess which genes were not regulated by HIF-la and thus could be
taken as the negative control set, we tried to compare our ﬁndings
with DNA sequence segments performing low transcription activity
or no transcription activity at all. To this end, we selected a set
of DNA segments located far from any DNA region, for which
transcription activity was demonstrated in TSS-calling experiments
(see the description of the set in the Section 2 and Section 1
in Supplementary Material). Surprisingly, in the low-transcription
regions, PPDD peaks were exhibited even more explicitly than in
the genome-wide set (Supplementary Fig. 9 and 10). Meanwhile,
the relative number of binding site pairs in this case was much
lower than in the genome-wide set (Supplementary Fig. 10). We
failed to provide an exhaustive explanation of a clearer PPDD for
the low transcribed dataset. Yet, it is noteworthy that preparation of
the genome-wide dataset included the merging of regions centered

at closely located alternative TSSs. It is possible that the genome-
wide PPDD includes distances measured between TFBSs belonging
to different homotypic clusters which regulate transcription from
different TSSs and this interference smears the PPDD.

Moreover, we counted the number of CAGE-tags located in three
subsets of low-transcription regions set: the ﬁrst having no HRE—
HRE or HRE—Spl binding site pairs, the second having pairs at
any distance not consistent with PPDT within 600 bp HRE-centered
windows and the third having pairs of TFBS at PPDT-consistent
distances according to PPDT evaluated from the genome-wide set.
Supplementary Table 2 displays the median of the number of CAGE
tags per sequence. The sequences with binding site pairs located
at PPDT-consistent distances tend to be relatively enriched with
CAGE-tags. Thus, we suggest that the PPDT-consistent binding
site pairs found in low-transcription regions are somehow linked
to nearby transcriptionally active regions.

4 DISCUSSION

In our previous work (Kulakovskiy et al., 2011), we reported the
observation that a large genome-wide set of long segments exhibits
some peaks in the distribution of distances between TFBSs of
interacting TFs. In this study, we introduce the concept of PPDT,
a set of selected preferred distances between TFBSs, which, as we
demonstrate, are expected to be found in the regulatory regions of
genes, regulated by the corresponding TFs.

Preferred distances between TFBS for different TF pairs form
substantially different sets, but in all cases a general pattern of a
peak comb over a background of more or less random distances is
observed. It is tempting to believe that binding sites found at PPDT
inconsistent distances are likely to form complexes with TFs other
than HIF-la or simply are false positives of PWM scanning. Yet,
PPDT found in the low-transcribed regions allows the conclusion
that there might be some yet unknown factor controlling possible
TFBS positioning in DNA.

Obviously, PPDD/Ts provide additional information on the
speciﬁcity of TF binding, especially when the total number of
putative TFBSs in the regulatory regions is small. However, the
difﬁculties of using PPDD/Ts for identiﬁcation of ﬁinctional binding
sites should not be underestimated. Binding site arrangements in
regulatory DNA segments are complex, with sites often overlapping
each other. Most of the sequences in the hypoxia-regulated dataset
contain homotypic clusters of HRE. So when one calculates all
pairwise distances between binding sites of two transcription
factors, the number of observed intersite distances becomes large.
Paradoxically, the worst display of preferred distances is in the
hypoxia-regulated dataset (Supplementary Fig. 11). This happens
because this dataset is rather small, containing only 158 sequences,
25 of which do not contain any HRE elements. Many sequences
contain only one or two pairs of binding sites of the speciﬁed type.
In the hypoxia-regulated dataset, each distance is rarely found more
often than ﬁve times. Thus, most numbers of preferred distance
occurrences are statistically insigniﬁcant, and the PPDD/T pattern
is unclear. This makes it difﬁcult to conclude whether the hypoxia-
regulated set really has some major characteristic differences in
PPDDs when compared with the genome-wide set.

Another paradox is that PPDTs for HRE—Spl and HRE—HRE
homotypic site pairs estimated on the genome-wide gene set can be
efﬁciently used to distinguish the hypoxia-regulated set (Fig. 2). This

is also true for some other HRE—TFBS pairs (Supplementary Fig. 5).
This property looks promising for identifying hypoxia-dependent
genes, because the procedure excludes overﬁtting. Indeed, the
positive gene set (the set of hypoxia-regulated genes) in this case
works as a test dataset rather than as a training dataset.

A large number of HRE—HRE homotypic pairs tend to have
very small spacers (see corresponding HRE—HRE PPDD/Ts in
Supplementary Figs 2—4). To explain this result, it is enough to
suggest that HIF-1a2ARNT dimers form higher order complexes
bound to nearby HREs corresponding to the HRE—HRE PPDD/T).
This suggestion is supported by the sequence motif found de novo
using the data from (Ortiz-Barahona et al., 2010), see Supplementary
Figure 12.

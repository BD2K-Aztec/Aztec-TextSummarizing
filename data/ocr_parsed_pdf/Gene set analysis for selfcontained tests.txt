ABSTRACT

Motivation: The analysis of differentially expressed gene sets became
a routine in the analyses of gene expression data. There is a multitude
of tests available, ranging from aggregation tests that summarize
gene-level statistics for a gene set to true multivariate tests, account-
ing for intergene correlations. Most of them detect complex depart-
ures from the null hypothesis but when the null hypothesis is rejected,
the specific alternative leading to the rejection is not easily identifiable.
Results: In this article we compare the power and Type I error rates of
minimum-spanning tree (MST)-based non-parametric multivariate
tests with several multivariate and aggregation tests, which are fre-
quently used for pathway analyses. In our simulation study, we dem-
onstrate that MST-based tests have power that is for many settings
comparable with the power of conventional approaches, but outper-
form them in specific regions of the parameter space corresponding to
biologically relevant configurations. Further, we find for simulated and
for gene expression data that MST-based tests discriminate well
against shift and scale alternatives. As a general result, we suggest
a two-step practical analysis strategy that may increase the interpret-
ability of experimental data: first, apply the most powerful multivariate
test to find the subset of pathways for which the null hypothesis is
rejected and second, apply MST-based tests to these pathways to
select those that support speciﬁc alternative hypotheses.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the era of high-throughput biology, technical difﬁculties of
obtaining large-scale datasets are gradually becoming less
pronounced, as compared with difficulties in the data analyses
and interpretation. In the analysis of gene expression data, a
conceptual shift toward a better interpretability of results hap-
pened almost a decade ago, when, instead of testing for the dif-
ferential expression of a single gene, the ﬁrst test for testing the
differential expression of a set of genes, Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) (Mootha et al., 2003) was suggested. The moti-
vating ideas of GSEA are 3-fold. First, small changes in gene

expression, a sign mark of metabolic diseases, cannot be cap-
tured by a single gene using conventional tests such as a t-statistic
together with a correction for multiple testing (Mootha et al.,
2003). Second, the data interpretation can be greatly facilitated:
conventionally gene sets represent molecular pathways and the
differential expression of a pathway has more explanatory power
compared with a single differentially expressed gene. Third, genes
do not work in isolation but interact with each other; as a
consequence, accounting for the multivariate nature of expres-
sion changes is more biologically relevant (Emmert—Streib and
Glazko, 2011; Glazko and Emmert—Streib, 2009). Since the
advent of GSEA, many methodologies for testing the differential
expression of gene sets (molecular pathways, biological pro-
cesses) have been suggested and collectively named Gene Set
Analysis (GSA) approaches (Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009;
Dinu et al., 2009; Emmert—Streib and Glazko, 2011; Huang da
et al., 2009). GSA approaches have been classiﬁed into two cate-
gories: competitive and self-contained (Goeman and Buhlmann,
2007; Tian et al., 2005). Competitive approaches compare a gene
set against a background dataset, and self-contained tests com-
pare whether a gene set is differentially expressed between two
phenotypes. That means, self-contained tests are conceptually
similar to classical two-sample statistical inference methods,
e.g. individual gene tests based on a t-test, only with the unit
of change being a set of genes rather than a single gene.
Unfortunately, both categories have their own pitfalls and bene-
ﬁts. For instance, competitive approaches are dependent on the
size of the entire dataset (Allison et al., 2006), whereas in the case
of self-contained approaches, a potential weakness is that null
hypotheses tested by self-contained tests are not equivalent
(Emmert—Streib and Glazko, 2011; Glazko and Emmert-Streib,
2009).

Previously, we demonstrated that the space of null hypotheses
for self-contained GSA is mostly covered by three null hypoth-
eses: their exact formulation reflects the underlying test statistic
(Glazko and Emmert—Streib, 2009). Specifically, consider the
multivariate distribution of gene expressions in a gene set for a
given phenotype. For the multivariate Hotelling Tz-statistic null
hypothesis is formulated as the equality of the mean expression
vectors of the two multivariate gene expression distributions
(Kong et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2005; Xiong, 2006) and the null
hypothesis of multivariate N-statistic is the equality of the two
multivariate gene expression distributions (Klebanov et al.,
2007). In contrast, gene-level test statistics aggregating scores,

describing changes in the expression of individual genes (e. g. the
squared values of individual t-tests), state the null hypothesis as
the equality of aggregated scores between phenotypes
(Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009; Jiang and Gentleman, 2007;
Tian et al., 2005). The aforementioned three null hypotheses are
not equivalent and each test projects on different aspects of the
data. It should be emphasized, that gene-level test statistics dis-
regard existing, complex correlation structures within a gene set.
In real biological settings, moderate (Montaner et al., 2009), as
well as extensive (Gatti et al., 2010) correlations between genes in
gene sets are well documented (Tripathi and Emmert—Streib,
2012) and can result in a decrease in power for gene-level tests,
compared with multivariate tests (Glazko and Emmert-Streib,
2009; Tripathi and Emmert—Streib, 2012; Wang et al., 2011).

In this article, we further explore the opportunities to increase
the biological interpretability of experimental results under the
self-contained GSA framework. We start with the introduction
of multivariate generalizations of the WaldiWolfowitz (WW)
and KolmogoroviSmirnov (KS) non-parametric two-sample
tests, which were developed more than three decades ago
(Friedman and Rafsky, 1979) based on the minimum spanning
tree (MST) structure. These tests, however, have never been con-
sidered and implemented in the context of gene set analysis prior
to our work. Using simulated data, as well as expression arrays
we compare the properties of multivariate WW and KS tests with
conventional multivariate tests, such as the N—statistic (Klebanov
et al., 2007) and rotation gene set test (ROAST) (Wu et al.,
2010), as well as gene-level tests, such as SAM-GS (Dinu et al.,
2007) and the median of P—Values from t-tests for individual
genes.

One property of multivariate non-parametric two-sample tests,
namely that they can discriminate against several alternative
hypotheses (Friedman and Rafsky, 1979), is speciﬁcally import-
ant in the context of data interpretability. For instance, a typical
analysis question that asks, ‘Is the expression of a pathway dif-
ferent between two phenotypes’, can be too unspecific from a
biological perspective. For this reason, employing statistical
hypotheses tests that allow formulating more speciﬁc alternatives
can sharpen the initial question itself, elucidating why the null
hypothesis H0 was rejected. The R-code for the multivariate gen-
eralizations of the WW and KS non-parametric two-sample tests
is available in the Supplementary Material.

2. METHODS

Consider two biological conditions with different outcomes, with n1 sam-
ples of measurements of [7 genes for the ﬁrst, and n2 samples of measure-
ment of the same [7 genes for the second conditions. Let the two
p-dimensional random vectors of measurements X: (X1, . . . , X“) and
Y: (Y1, . . . , Ynz) be independent and identically distributed with the dis-
tribution functions F, G, mean vectors A7, I’and p x p covariance matrices
Sx, Sy. We consider the problem of testing the hypothesis H0: F =G
against an alternative F 7e G.

In what follows, we brieﬂy describe two multivariate generalizations of
the WW and KS tests (see Friedman and Rafsky (1979) for more details)
and discuss other conventional self-contained GSA approaches we use.
The simulation setup to explore the properties of GSA approaches closely
follows our previous strategy (Glazko and Emmert-Streib, 2009) and is
brieﬂy outlined in the end of this section.

2.1. Test statistics

2.1.] Multivariate generalization of the WW and KS
tests When [7:] the WW and KS tests both begin by sorting the
N =n1 +n2 observations in ascending order. Then, in the WW test the
observation is replaced by its sample labels (X or Y) and the number of
‘runs’ (R) is calculated, where R is a consecutive sequence of identical
labels. The test statistic is a function of the number of runs and is ap-
proximately normally distributed. H0 is rejected if the number of runs is
small. In the KS test, observations are ranked and the quantity
d,- = ri/nl — s,-/n2 is calculated; r,- (s,-) are number of observations in X
(Y) ranked lower than i, l 5 i 5 N. The test statistic is the maximal abso-
lute difference as follows:

D = max |d,-| (1)

H0 is rejected for large differences.

The multivariate generalization for both tests (p> 1), suggested in
(Friedman and Rafsky, 1979) is based on the MST. The MST of an
ed ge-weighted graph is a spanning tree with the minimal sum of weighted
edges. For pooled multivariate observations X, Yan edge-weighted graph
can be constructed, with N nodes and N(N — l)/2 edge weights estimated
by the Euclidean (or any other) distances between pairs of points in R”.
The MST of a graph connects points that are ‘close’ in R”. In this way, it
associates similar nodes (samples) in terms of their distances. Similar to
the univariate case, in the multivariate generalization of the WW test, all
edges in a MST incident between nodes belonging to different sample
labels are removed, and the number of the remaining disjoint subtrees (R)
is calculated (Friedman and Rafsky, 1979). The permutation distribution
of the standardized number of subtrees

_ R — E[R]
_ ./Var[R]

is asymptotically normal and H0 is rejected for a small number of subtrees
(Friedman and Rafsky, 1979).

The multivariate generalization of KS ranks multivariate observations
based on their MST. The purpose of MST ranking (see below) is to
obtain the strong relation between observations differences in ranks
and their distances in R”. The ranking algorithm can be designed specif-
ically to conﬁne a particular alternative hypothesis more power. The
general scheme is to root MST tree at a node with the largest geodesic
distance and then rank the nodes in the ‘high directed preorder’ traversal
of the tree. As in the univariate case, the test statistic D (with tabulated
distribution) is found for the ranked nodes. If one is interested in a test
with high power (HP) toward changes in the variance structure of the
distribution, the ranking is implemented differently, aiming to give higher
ranks to more distant points in R”. That is, MST tree is rooted at the
node with the smallest geodesic distance and nodes with the largest depths
are assigned higher ranks (Friedman and Rafsky, 1979). This ‘radial’
Kolrnogorovismirnov (RKS) test is sensitive to alternatives having simi-
lar mean vectors but differences in scale. We want to mention that the
underlying conceptual idea of the WW and KS tests based on MSTs is
similar to (Emmert-Streib, 2007), however, with reversed roles for the
usage of samples and genes.

2.1.2 Other multivariate tests We selected two other multivariate
test statistics, based on their high power and popularity. N-statistic was
suggested independently by Klebanov et al. (2007), and by Baringhaus
and Franz (2004). N-statistic tests the most general hypothesis H: F: G
against a two-sided alternative F 7e G:

Gene set analysis and aftemative hypotheses

 

Here, we consider only L(X, Y) : ||X — Y H, the Euclidian distance in
R”. In the original papers, several other kernel functions, L were sug-
gested as well (Baringhaus and Franz, 2004; Klebanov et al., 2007). N-
statistic is actually a metric on the space of all probability measures on R”
(Klebanov et al., 2007).

Rotation gene set tests (ROAST) (Wu et al., 2010) uses the framework
of linear models and tests whether for all genes in a set a particular
contrast of the coefﬁcients is non-zero (Wu et al., 2010). It can account
for correlations between genes and has the ﬂexibility of using different
alternative hypotheses, testing whether the direction of changes for a gene
in a set is ‘up’, ‘down’ or ‘mixed’ (up or down) (Wu et al., 2010). For all
comparisons implemented here, the ‘mixed’ hypothesis was selected.

2.1.3 Univariate test Gene-level tests for GSA can be easily de-
signed in three steps: (i) select a gene-level score based on a univariate
test statistic (e.g. a value of t-test) (ii) transform a score (e.g. take an
absolute value of t-test, or consider its P-value) and (iii) summarize
gene-level scores into a gene set statistic (e.g. take an average of trans-
formed scores) (Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009). For instance, as a sum-
mary gene set statistic, the median and mean of gene-level P-values from
t-tests were employed. We observed that the mean of P-values had less
power compared with the median (data not shown). In the following,
only results for the median of P-values (mpv-test) are presented.

Shrinking the standard error of a test statistic (e.g. a t-test) in testing
differential expression of individual genes improves the power of the test.
Several shrinkage approaches at the level of individual genes were sug-
gested, including the Signiﬁcance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) test
(Tusher et al., 2001), the regularized t-test (Baldi and Long, 2001) and
the moderated t-test (Smyth, 2004). An extension of SAM test to gene set
analysis (SAM-GS) was also suggested (Dinu et al., 2007) and has been
demonstrated to outperform several conventional self-contained tests,
including competetive GSEA approach (Dinu et al., 2007, 2009; Liu
et al., 2007). Therefore, we included SAM-GS in our comparative
power analysis.

2.1.4 Significance testing To estimate the null distribution of a test
statistic numerically to obtain P-values, for all test statistics, except
ROAST, 1000 sample permutations were used. ROAST uses a random
rotation of the data matrix, which has been shown to give meaningful
results, even for small sample sizes (Wu et al., 2010).

2.2 Simulation setup

In real biological settings not all genes in a gene set are differentially
expressed, and intergene correlations vary in strength (Tripathi and
Emmert-Streib, 2012). We therefore designed simulations speciﬁcally to
be able to control: (i) the percentage of genes, truly differentially ex-
pressed between two phenotypes, parameter y and (ii) the strength of
the correlations between genes, parameter r. These parameters seriously
inﬂuence the power of the test and it is important to understand the
magnitude of inﬂuence for different tests statistics.

We simulated two samples of equal size, N/2 (N: 40, N: 20, N: 10)
from the p-dimensional normal distribution N(O, Z) and N(a, Z) repre-
senting two biological conditions with different outcomes. We considered
two scenarios: when the number of genes in a gene set (pathway), [7 is
relatively small ([7: 20) and relatively large (p : 100). The y parameter,
indicating the proportion of genes in a pathway under alternative hypoth-
esis, was set to ye {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}. To control the strength of intergene
correlations for a gene set, three correlation regimes: low, medium and high
(0.1, 0.5, 0.9) were simulated. Two alternative hypotheses were formulated:

Hal. The mean vector for the ﬁrst biological condition was ﬁxed as 0
and all components a,- of the mean vector, p. for the second biological
condition were set to change from 0 to 2 with a step size of 0.2, that is p.
was varied from p. : (0, ..., 0) to p. : (2, ..., 2). The diagonal elements of
the covariance matrix s2 i.e. variances of individual genes, were set to 1.

‘ii’

Haz. The mean vectors for both conditions were ﬁxed at p. : (0, ..., 0)
but the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix sfi, i.e. variances of
individual genes, were ﬁxed in one condition and set to change from 1 to
5 with a step size of 0.5 in the other.

For alternatives Hal and Haz, different settings result in 24 and 6
simulated datasets, respectively. For each value of the mean or the vari-

ance, we averaged over 1000 independent runs (gene sets).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulation study

3.1.] Type I error rate Table 1 presents estimates for the at-
tained signiﬁcance levels of the seven tests. As can be seen,
ROAST and SAM-GS provide more conservative estimates of
the Type I error rate for small and medium intergene correlations
than the N—statistic. In turn, the N—statistic controls the Type I
error rate slightly better than non-parametric generalizations of
the WW and KS tests, while the median P—Values test shows the
best control (Table 1).

3.1.2 The power of tests to detect shift alternatives Figure 1
presents the results of power estimates, when Hal is true, for
seven tests with p:20 genes in a pathway. The parameter y
(the percentage of genes, truly differentially expressed between
two phenotypes, y e{0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}) is increasing from the
top to the bottom for all three columns. The parameter re{0. 1,
0.5, 0.9} (intergene correlations) is increasing from the left to the
right for all four rows.

First, consider the case, when all genes in a pathway are differ-
entially expressed (y: 1) and the intergene correlations are low
(r: 0.1). In this case, the seven tests form three different groups
(Fig. 1j). N-statistic, ROAST and SAM-GS have an identical
power and form one group with a high power (HP) capable of
detecting small changes; the median of P—Values test (median of P-
value test (mpV-test)), multivariate KS and WW tests form an-
other group with a lower power (LP); the RKS test has almost no
power (NP) to detect even large differences. This is actually what
one would expect: the power of non-parametric tests is slightly
lower than the power of parametric tests, the power of gene-level
test without shrinking the standard error is lower than the power
of the shrinkage (SAM-GS) and multivariate tests. The test sen-
sitive for the scale alternative, expectedly, has almost no power to
detect the shift alternative. This categorization remains un-
changed (same tests belong to HP, LP, NP groups) even when
we alter the number of differentially expressed genes, given the
intergene correlations are still low (r : 0.1, ﬁrst column of Fig. 1).
Only the power of the mpV-test decreases to zero for y:0.25.
Also, it should be noted that W is becoming more powerful
than KS when the y parameter is decreasing.

Unexpected changes in the power curves are seen for higher
correlations and y e{0.25, 0.5, 0.75} (middle column, bottomi
up). Given r:0.5, the content of the HP, LP, NP groups has
been changed. Now the WW test joins the HP group, and only
the KS test remains in the LP group. The power of the mpV-test
decreases fast with y. Further, the power of RKS remains low.

More dramatic changes in the power curves are seen when the
intergene correlations become the highest (r : 0.9) and y e {0.25,
0.5, 0.75} (right-most column, Fig. 1). For these settings, the
WW test outperforms all the others and populates along the

HP group, whereas ROAST, SAM-GS, N—statistic and KS test
form the LP group. As before, the power of the mpV-test de-
creases fast with y. Again, the power of the N—statistic and the
KS test is comparable and is becoming higher than the power of
ROAST and SAM-GS when y decreases.

The results for p : 100 (Supplementary Fig. S1) are similar to
those for p:20, but all the trends discussed above are more
pronounced. In general, when p: 100, the power of all tests
under different settings is higher and less dependent on y. The
power of the WW test is already higher than all the others when
r:0.5 and ye{0.25, 0.5, 0.75}. The power of the KS test is
higher than the power of ROAST, SAM-GS and N—statistic
when r:0.9 and ye{0.25, 0.5, 0.75} (Supplementary Fig. S1,
right-most column). The mpV-test has some power even when
y : 0.5.

To summarize, from the simulation results we can see that the
power of all tests, except WW, decreases with the increase of
intergene correlations. Unexpectedly, the power of WW test is
higher than that of all the other tests when the intergene correl-
ations are high: re{0.5, 0.9}, ye{0.25, 0.5, 0.75}. Notably, the
power of the KS test is comparable with the N-statistic, ROAST
and SAM-GS when simultaneously, y decreases and the inter-
gene correlations increase. RKS has almost no power in all con-
ditions. The power of the mpV-test is similar (but lower) to
ROAST, SAM-GS, KS and N—statistic when ye{1, 0.75}, but
is very small when y : 0.5 and decreases to zero when y: 0.25.

Fig. 1. The power curves of seven tests when shift alternative hypothesis
(Hal) holds true and the number of genes in pathways [7: 20 (N: 40)

All these results are expected, except the result for the WW test.
The question is: Why does WW outperform all other tests when
ye{0.25, 0.5, 0.75} and the correlations are high?

To investigate the behavior of the WW test in these settings,
we consider an example when p: 2 and there are two different
phenotypes, X and Y from two bivariate normal distributions
(Fig. 2). Consider the case when the intergene correlation is low
(Fig. 2a) and either one (y: 0.5), or two genes (y: 1) in a path-
way are differentially expressed (phenotypes Yy:0,5 and Yy: 1).
Samples from two phenotypes (either X, Yy:0,5 or X, Yy: 1) are
independent, scattered within two contours and the intersection
areas between phenotypes X and szojs and X and szl are of
similar size. The number of disjoint subtrees obtained from the
MST tree (R—statistic) is proportional to the number of samples
from X and Y in a close proximity of each other. That means,
when the correlation is low, the power of the WW test is similar
for both cases, y: 0.5 and y: 1. When correlation is high
(Fig. 2b), the samples are no longer independent and scattered
in the same direction. If y:0.5, one gene is changing, and the
distribution is shifted along one axis (450 with minor elliptical
axis). If y: 1, both genes are changing, and the distribution is
shifted in the direction of the major elliptical axis. The difference
in the shift directions results in a larger intersection area between
X and szl when compared with X and Yy:0,5, and as a con-
sequence, a smaller power of the WW test for a high gamma and
high correlations. This explanation can be generalized to cases
with p>2 and explains the high power exhibited by the WW test
in Figure 1 when r:{0.5, 0.9} and y:{0.25, 0.5, 0.75} com-
pared with the low power when y: 1.

Fig. 3. The power curves of six tests when scale alternative hypothesis
(Haz) holds true and the number of genes in a pathways [7: 20 (N: 40)

(intergene correlations) is increasing from left to right. As ex-
pected, WW, ROAST, SAM-GS and KS have no power to
detect changes in the scale, because they were not designed for
this scenario. RKS has a high power to detect even small changes
in the variance structure and outperforms the N—statistic for all
values of the intergene correlations. The power of the N—statistic
decreases signiﬁcantly when the correlation increases to r : 0.9.
Interestingly, in these settings, the WW test acquires some power
that increases for large differences in scale (Fig. 3). The results
for p: 100 (Supplementary Fig. S2) are similar to those for
p : 20.

For a sample size N :20 the power of all tests was signiﬁ-
cantly smaller, however, the pattern of differences between the
different tests remains the same (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4).
However, with the smaller sample size (N: 10) all tests perform
equally poor and comparative power analysis does not make
sense anymore (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). Because the
result for ROAST and SAM-GS were almost identical in all
settings, we did not include SAM-GS in the analysis of real data.

3.2 The analysis of solid tumors (kidney, lung and
pancreas) expression arrays

Table 2 presents the overview of the datasets analyzed, selected
from the comparative study of meta-analysis and integrated
approaches in (Dawany and Tozeren, 2010). Data were normal-
ized using the Robust Multi-array Average method and among
multiple probes measuring the same target mRNA probes with
maximum inter-quartile ranges (IQR) were selected. Half of the
probes that exhibit the lowest variability (IQR) were ﬁltered out,
as recommended (e.g. by Bourgon et al., 2010; Hackstadt and
Hess, 2009). At the end of these ﬁltering steps, the final number
of probes considered out of the total number for GSE7670,

GSE15471 and GSE15641 were 6359 out of 22283, 9899 out
of 54 675 and 6359 out of 22 283.

All three datasets (Table 2) have ‘normal’ and ‘cancer’ sam-
ples. To find pathways, differentially expressed between these
two phenotypes, six aforementioned tests were applied, and the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) database
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) was used as a source to define mo-
lecular pathways. Overall, three datasets had 201 KEGG path-
ways in common (Table 2). After controlling the false-discovery
rate (FDR) at a level of 0.05 with the Benjamini and Hochberg
(1995) procedure three tests, namely ROAST, N—statistic and
WW (except for GSE7670) found all these pathways to be dif-
ferentially expressed (Table 3). Although KS and the median
P—Values tests did not find all the pathways to be differentially
expressed, the amount found was comparable (1387198 path-
ways). Finally, the RKS test has found 126, 169 and 131 path-
ways to be differentially expressed for the lung, pancreas and
kidney cancer datasets, respectively. The result is similar to
what one could expect from the simulation study. In most set-
tings for the simulated data the N-statistic, ROAST and WW
have had a better power than the KS, RKS and median P—Values
tests.

The rejection of the null hypothesis H0 per se is important and
informative. However, there are potentially many reasons for a
rejection. Consider the most powerful test for the analysis of
differentially expressed pathways, N—statistic which is designed
to detect complex departures from the null hypothesis H0, such
as differences in marginal distributions, shift and scale alterna-
tives and changes in the correlation structures. Therefore, if the
null hypothesis is rejected by the N—statistic, we are not armed to
dissect the speciﬁc alternative leading to rejection. Similarly, if
ROAST or W reject the null hypothesis, the true alternative
hypothesis cannot be uniquely identiﬁed. The beneﬁt of applying
the new KS and RKS tests is that, while lacking the ﬂexibility to
test complex departures from H0, they are designed to detect the
simple alternatives: changes in the shift and scale. The knowledge
about these speciﬁc alternatives can be important in interpreting
the results. For this reason, we suggest using these two tests as
complementary tools to clarify the cause for the rejection of the
null hypothesis H0 (see below).

From our analysis, we found 17, 7 and 5 pathways for
GSE7670 (lung), GSE15471 (pancreas) and GSE15641
(kidney), respectively, only detected by RKS and not detected
by KS, and there were 65, 29 and 67 pathways only detected by
KS but not RKS (Table 3). RKS has the highest power to detect
scale, whereas KS has the highest power to detect shift alterna-
tives and in the pathways, detected exclusively by either one of
them, exactly these two moments are changing. Figure 4 presents
boxplots for the means and variances of genes, included in the
pathways, detected by RKS only. As one can see, even the uni-
variate differences in the mean variances between normal and
cancer samples are very pronounced (Fig. 4a43, right panels),
more pronounced than differences in the univariate mean
changes (Fig. 4aic, left panels). Interestingly, for pathways de-
tected by multivariate RKS and by both, RKS and KS tests,
there is a good agreement between the multivariate tests and
the univariate KS test of difference in the distributions of
mean expression variances (Supplementary Table S1).
However, there is no agreement between the univariate KS test

of difference in the distributions of mean expressions and its
multivariate counterpart (Supplementary Table S1). These obser-
vations underscore the high power of RKS to detect scale
differences.

Figure 5 presents boxplots and MST trees for three selected
pathways (GSE15641, kidney cancer) detected by RKS only
(Fig. 5a), KS only (Fig. 5b) and KS and RKS (Fig. 5c) tests.
It is Visually compelling that in all three cases the ‘amount’ of
differences between the mean variances and the mean expressions
between two phenotypes is in agreement with the test-specific
alternatives. MST trees for the selected pathways (Fig. 5)
show major differences. For the mRNA surveillance pathway
(Fig. 5a), samples of one phenotype constitute the backbone of
the MST, while samples of the other phenotype form the
branches. Since the center node is naturally at the center of the
backbone, there are significant differences in ranks assigned to
two phenotypes. In contrast, for pathways detected by KS (Fig.
5b) and KS and RKS (Fig. SC) on the corresponding MST trees
samples of each phenotype are grouped together.

Another important result is that pathways, detected exclu-
sively by RKS (Supplementary Table S2) were tumor-speciﬁc,
that means among them only one (‘Neurothrophin signaling
pathway’, 04722) was simultaneously detected in two datasets
(GSE7670, lung and GSE15641, kidney cancer data).
Pathways, detected by the KS test only, were less specific: there
were 8 and 21 common pathways, between GSE7670 (lung) and
GSE15471 (pancreas), GSE15641 (kidney), respectively, and 9
common pathways between GSE15471 and GSE15641
(Supplementary Table S2). For all three datasets there was one
pathway, ‘Circadian rhythmimammal’ detected by KS as

having differences in mean vectors between normal and cancer
samples. Because the N—statistic detected all 201 pathways as
being differentially expressed, not surprisingly, there were 53
pathways, detected simultaneously by RKS and KS in all three
datasets (Supplementary Table S3). It may indicate that the rest
of the pathways (that is pathways detected exclusively by the N-
statistic, as well as ROAST and WW tests, and not by RKS and
KS, or RKS only, or KS only) have a more complex departure
from the null hypothesis H0, than the scale and shift alternatives.

The analysis of the real data demonstrates that the N-statistic,
ROAST and W are robust and consistently detect any kind of
departure from an alternative on a set of solid tumors. In turn,
pathways, discovered exclusively by RKS or KS (to a smaller
extent) highlight changes pertinent to a speciﬁc tumor.

4. DISCUSSION

Interpretation of the results of any large-scale genomic experi-
ment is a challenge. Testing the differential expression of gene
sets (GSA) is routinely used for gene expression data analysis
(Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009; Emmert—Streib and Glazko,
2011; Hung et al., 2012) in particular, to gain more insights
into specific pathways, underlying phenotypic changes. There
are many self-contained GSA approaches available (Ackermann
and Strimmer, 2009; Emmert—Streib and Glazko, 2011) but all of
them have a potential weakness: the analysis result is difﬁcult to
interpret. For example, N—statistic, the most powerful multivari-
ate test, has a complex alternative hypothesis: difference of two
multivariate distributions (Klebanov et al., 2007). Similarly, tests
employing aggregated score of gene-level test statistics do not
have a well-speciﬁed alternative (Ackermann and Strimmer,
2009). Here, we demonstrate that the application of multivariate
generalizations of the WW and KS (including RKS) non-
parametric two-sample tests, that were developed by Friedman
and Rafsky (1979), makes GSA approaches more comprehensive
and helps to interpret the results better.

Our simulation study suggests that W, KS and RKS all have
speciﬁc characteristics important in the analysis of real biological
data. Contrary to the conventional GSA multivariate tests
(such as N—statistic and ROAST), the power of the WW test
increases with the increase of the intergene correlations. This is

an unexpected property suitable for the analysis of highly corre-
lated expression data. In turn, the KS and RKS tests also have
important differences from conventional tests: KS is exclusively
sensitive to shift and RKS is mostly sensitive to scale alternatives,
respectively. The analysis of real expression data conﬁrms the
major trends in the tests’ power, observed in simulations.
Indeed, for all three expression datasets considered the WW
test is as powerful as conventional approaches. In turn, RKS
and KS tests can detect different alternatives.

From our analysis, we suggest the following approach for a
GSA: ﬁrst, use the most powerful multivariate test (e. g. N—stat-
istic or W test) for detecting all pathways for which the null
hypothesis H0 is rejected. Then, for a subset of these pathways
the cause for their detection can be found by testing for a shift
and scale alternatives, using KS or RKS. The pathways, selected
under different alternatives potentially will help in interpreting
the reasons of underlying phenotypic changes. The intersection
of genes in these pathways can constitute a phenotype-speciﬁc
gene signature, different for different alternatives and important
in the follow-up studies.

There are many opportunities to improve the tests’ sensitivity
and scope, provided by MST structure employed in non-
parametric multivariate generalization of two-sample tests. For
instance, a MST tree can be constructed using any dissimilarity
measure and for any types of data (on an ordinal or ratio scale).
That means the multivariate generalization of KS and W are
readily applicable for the analysis of RNA-Seq data, represented
by read counts. Further, for such data a different dissimilarity
measure than that used in our study (Euclidean distance) may
lead to differences in the observed power. Another interesting
opportunity provided by a MST structure is in defining a per-
tinent procedure for a subtrees ranking that can be sensitive to
various alternatives. We conclude that the use of the multivariate
non-parametric generalization of two-sample tests and the
exploration of their potential improvement can increase our abil-
ity to interpret the results of large-scale expression experiments
and dissect relevant biological processes leading to phenotypic
changes between two conditions.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The results of initial analyses for many high-throughput
technologies commonly take the form of gene or protein sets, and
one of the ensuing tasks is to evaluate the functional coherence of
these sets. The study of gene set function most commonly makes
use of controlled vocabulary in the form of ontology annotations.
For a given gene set, the statistical significance of observing these
annotations or ‘enrichment’ may be tested using a number of
methods. Instead of testing for significance of individual terms, this
study is concerned with the task of assessing the global functional
coherence of gene sets, for which novel metrics and statistical
methods have been devised.

Results: The metrics of this study are based on the topological
properties of graphs comprised of genes and their Gene Ontology
annotations. A novel aspect of these methods is that both the
enrichment of annotations and the relationships among annotations
are considered when determining the significance of functional
coherence. We applied our methods to perform analyses on an
existing database and on microarray experimental results. Here, we
demonstrated that our approach is highly discriminative in terms
of differentiating coherent gene sets from random ones and that it
provides biologically sensible evaluations in microarray analysis. We
further used examples to show the utility of graph visualization as a
tool for studying the functional coherence of gene sets.

1 INTRODUCTION

For a gene set, the ﬁ1nctiona1 coherence is a measure of the strength
of the relatedness of the functions associated with the genes, which
can be used to differentiate a set of genes performing coherently
related functions from ones consisting of randomly grouped genes.
It is commonly evaluated by analyzing the genes’ functional
annotations, which are almost invariably in the form of the controlled
vocabulary from the Gene Ontology (GO; Ashbumer et a1., 2000;
Brown et a1., 2000; Huang et a1., 2009; Khatri and Draghici, 2005;
Mateos et a1., 2002). The vocabulary terms are organized as a
graph, with concepts ranging from very general to very speciﬁc.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

They are used to annotate gene products by a variety of methods,
including human curation, based on evidence from the literature.
The annotations capture what is known about the biology. Functional
coherence can be reﬂected in two aspects. First, whether genes share
similar functions or whether they participate in the same biological
processes. For example, if a sufﬁcient number of genes from a set
are annotated with a common GO term, the annotation is considered
to be ‘enriched’ and, therefore, the genes are deemed functionally
coherent. Second, whether the distinct functions are related. The
relationship between functional annotations can be either semantic
or biological in nature. For example, if a gene is annotated with the
term regulation of apoptosis and another one is labeled with the term
induction of apoptosis, their functions can be considered coherent
because the terms are semantically alike. Alternatively, annotations
can be semantically distinct, e.g. apoptosis and electron transport
chain, yet their co-occurrence in a gene set can be biologically
meaningful if many genes in the set participate in both processes.
Ideally, a measure of functional coherence should take the above
aspects into account during evaluation. To date, a method unifying
the enrichment and relatedness aspects of functional coherence
remains to be developed.

The ﬁrst aspect of ﬁinctional coherence, evaluating GO term
enrichment, is usually performed by various count-based methods
that evaluate the probability of observing a GO term in a set
by random chance—to determine if an individual term is over-
represented in a gene set. The widely used count-based methods
are based on the hypergeometric distribution or other similar
probabilistic models (Cho et a1., 2001; Huang et a1., 2009; Khatri
and Draghici, 2005; Man et a1., 2000). The merits and limitations of
this family of methods are well documented (Khatri and Draghici,
2005; Zheng and Lu, 2007). Since the objective of count-based
methods is focused on individual terms, directly utilizing their
results, e.g. P-values, to assess overall coherence encounters the
following difﬁculties: (i) schemes (ad hoc or sophisticated) need to
be devised in order to combine the results of individual tests into a
uniﬁed measure; (ii) the relationships among the terms are ignored
by treating each annotation independently; and (iii) multiple testing
potentially leads to false positives results, thus a less reliable uniﬁed
measure.

The second aspect, evaluating the relatedness among distinct
annotations, has been investigated in several studies that utilized the
directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the GO. A number
of studies have used the ontology graph structure in the context of
functional analyses; however, the speciﬁc purpose or information
used often differs from the methods proposed in this study, making
a direct comparison between methods less meaningful. One theme
is to ﬁnd the representative summary term(s) utilizing the graph

structure. For example, the lowest common ancestor terms have been
used to ﬁnd summarizing GO terms (Lee et a1., 2004). Making use
of the topology of the GO graph, Alexa et a1. (2006) devised several
algorithms to identify the representative GO terms and ﬁirther to
reweight the scores of the terms. Another theme utilizing the GO
graph structure is to quantify the semantic relationships among the
GO terms and derive statistics to assess their similarity. For example,
the average of pairwise shortest paths between the annotated terms
has been used to develop both pairwise and group-level measures
of gene set similarity (Ruths et a1., 2009; Wang et a1., 2007). Other
authors have used semantic similarity to summarize the results of
enrichment analyses (Xu et a1., 2009). Another measure of similarity,
the total ancestry measure, was developed by Yu and co-workers
(Yu et a1., 2007) to summarize the ﬁinctional similarity of GO terms
from a gene set. Furthermore, GO graph-based studies have been
carried out to evaluate the ﬁinctional coherence of gene sets via the
integration of multiple data sources. Several methods make use of
microarray expression data (Goeman and Mansmann, 2008; Kong
et a1., 2006), while others use the biomedical literature associated
with genes (Raychaudhuri and Altman, 2003; Zheng and Lu, 2007).
However, none of these methods have considered both aspects
of functional coherence, nor have they explicitly considered the
relationships among GO terms co-annotating genes, which provide
additional biological information.

In this study, we introduce a novel approach to assess the
ﬁinctional coherence of gene sets by taking into account both the
enrichment of GO terms and their relationships among terms, of
which a conceptual overview is illustrated in Figure 1. Our methods
offer three novel aspects. First, the genes and their annotations are
represented with a subgraph derived from the GO graph, in which
genes and GO terms are represented as nodes, and their relationships
are represented as quantiﬁable edges (gene-to-term and term-to-
term). By studying the topological properties of the graph with
methods from graph theory (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Newman,
2003), we have identiﬁed a set of metrics that reﬂect both the
enrichment of GO terms and the relationships among them, which
makes possible the differentiation of known coherent gene sets from
randomly grouped ones. Second, we utilized the information of co-
annotation of genes by a pair GO terms, a source of information
ignored by most of contemporary methods, to further enhance the
discriminative power of the graph-based metrics. Finally, we have
developed a principled framework by employing simulation and
non-parametric statistical methods, which enables us to directly
test the null hypothesis that a gene set consists of random grouped
genes. When applied to the gene sets from the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Kanehisa et a1., 2006),
the metrics were shown to be highly discriminative in terms of
differentiating known coherent gene sets from random ones; when
tested on gene sets derived from microarray analysis, the metrics
provided biologically sensible assessments.

2 METHODS
2.1 Constructing GO-based graphs

For each organism considered in the study (Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Mus musculus and Homo sapiens). a speciﬁc geneﬁO association ﬁle
was downloaded from the website of the GO Annotation project of the
European Bioinformatics Institute (August 13. 2009) from http://www
.geneontology.org/GO.current.annotationsshtml. Additionally. on the same

or other methods. (C) A GO Steiner tree is extracted and several types

discover more about the functional relationships between the G01.

day an ontology ﬁle was downloaded from http://archive.geneontology.org/
latest-termdb/go_daily-termdb.obo-xml.gz. The deﬁnition ﬁle was also
downloaded from the GO website and it was used to construct a DAG
in the biological process subspace. We have developed a Python library
with a set of application programming interfaces for building different GO-
related graphs and performing various queries (Muller et a1., 2009). This
library is based on the Python package NetworkX (Hagberg et a1., 2008).
In a graph representation of the GO. referred to as GOGraph. each node
(vertex) represents a GO term and each directed edge corresponds to the
IS_A relationship between a parentichild GO term pair. The directed edges
between terms represent their semantic relationship such that the concept of
a parent node subsumes those of its children nodes. Hence. the constructed
GOGraph obeys the ‘true path rule” or in other words the pathway from a
child term to the most top-level parent is always true. Then. genes are added
as another type of node to the GOGraph Via an edge to its associated GO
term(s) to create the GOGeneGraph. The GOGeneGraph is further modiﬁed
by the addition of edges between terms that share the same gene annotations.
Associating GO terms with the genes they annotate enables the calculation of
semantic distance for edges from a GOGraph using the established methods.
see Section 2.2 for details. After initialization of the edge distances. the
graph is further transformed into a weighted. undirected graph. so that the
functional coherence of list of GO terms can be reﬂected by connectivity
and distances among the terms rather than the directionality. The algorithm
for constructing a GOGeneGraph is detailed in Supplementary Algorithm 1.

2.2 Semantic distance

A commonly used method to measure the semantic distance between terms
is based on information theory. in which differences in the information

content (IC; Jiang and Conrath. 1998; Lord et a1., 2003; Pesquita et a1.,
2009; Resnik. 1995) of semantic entities are employed as a measure of the
semantic distance. Adopting the same principle. the IC of a GO term was
calculated as follows:

IC(t)= —lnP(t), (1)
where P(t) is the number of annotation instances for the term divided by total
number of annotation instances from the annotation database. We can then
deﬁne the semantic distance between a parentichild pair of GO terms as

dist(t],, to) = |IC(t],) — IC(tc) |. (2)
Adding gene nodes into a GOGraph introduces new paths/connections
between a pair of GO terms (through term-gene-term paths). if they share one
or more genes. Thus. a GOGeneGraph not only provides information about
the semantic relationship between terms according to the GO deﬁnitions. but
also reveals the presence of biological relationships between terms according
to biological annotation evidence. To quantify the strength of a biological
relationship. a new term-to-term edge is added between a pair of terms
sharing one or more genes. The distance for a given new edge is then set
to the length of the semantic edge in the GOGraph G occupying the ﬁfth
percentile dps divided by the number of genes shared by the pair

dps 6 {do}
lgijl

where (16 is the set of all edge distances in the GOGraph G and lgw-l is

the number of genes providing biological connections between GO terms

(3)

a =

i and j. Equation 3 reﬂects the following reasonings: (i) co-annotation is
relatively rare event and often biologically meaningful. thus its semantic
distance should correspond to a signiﬁcantly short distance for which we
chose the ﬁfth percentile of all edges; and (ii) the more genes that provide
the connection between a pair of GO terms. the shorter the distance and the
stronger the biological relationship between the terms.

2.3 Extracting a G0 Steiner tree

Given a gene set. the GO terms associated with the genes. referred to as seed
terms. are identiﬁed in the GOGeneGraph. To investigate the relationship
among the seed terms. we extract a subgraph connecting the seed terms.
including both inherited termiterm and augmented termiterm edges [see
Equations (2) and (3)]. such that the sum of all edge lengths for the subgraph
is minimized for all possible subgraphs connecting the terms. The problem
of ﬁnding such a subgraph is known as the Steiner-tree problem in computer
science (Gilbert and Pollak. 1968). We refer to the Steiner tree subgraph of a
GOGeneGraph as a G0 Steiner tree (T,,). In this study. Kou’s algorithm (Kou
et a1., 1981) is adopted to extract a G0 Steiner tree from a GOGeneGraph.
The heuristic algorithm for obtaining TS, is summarized in Supplementary
Algorithm 2.

2.4 Graph-based functional coherence metrics

Three metrics were devised based on the topological properties of GO Steiner
trees in order to reﬂect the functional coherence of a gene set. Building on the
concept of enrichment. we deﬁne the number of genes associated with a seed
term as seed degree (k,) and the averaged seed degree of a tree. is denoted as
(k,). which reﬂects a global measure of enrichment for the GO terms in the
gene set. To integrate the semantic relationships between terms. we deﬁne
the sum of the lengths of all edges within a tree as the total length (l) of a
G0 Steiner tree. which reﬂects the overall relatedness of the functions. We
also deﬁne (km) 2 (kl-i) as a measure of relative seed degree. which combines
the above two aspects of functional coherence. The G0 Steiner-tree metrics
(k,) and l are produced by summing a number of variables. in proportion to

 

the size of a gene set n and with respect to a given n they tend to be Gaussian
distributed. with estimable parameters 11,, and (7%.

2.5 Non-parametric regression

The distribution of the aforementioned metrics change as the size of the gene
set (n) changes. In particular. the mean and variance may exhibit a distinct

relationship with the get set size. To capture these relationships. we adopted
a non-parametric regression method (Nadaraya. 1964) to estimate the means
and variances. 11,, and (7%. of trees as nonlinear functions of n. Let y,, denote
the value of a metric from a G0 Steiner tree with size of n. We then deﬁne
the following relationships:

The relationship between the gene set size n and the parameters governing
the graph-based metrics y,, for the random gene sets was investigated by
sampling a la£ge number of randomly generated gene sets as training data.

was set to 15 for all regressions in this study. All numerical analyses were
carried out using the Python package Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org) and
the statistical language R (http://www.r-project.org).

The assumption that (k,) and l are Gaussian distributed with respect to the
size of a gene set n was tested using the ShapiroiWilk (Shapiro and Wilk.
1965) test. as implemented in R. and the results (see Supplementary Methods)
indicate that the P-Value for observing a statistic from a tree with n genes
can be calculated according to the Gaussian distribution function. Under
certain assumptions. the distribution of the statistic (km) can be represented
using a Cauchy distribution. However. empirical results indicated that the
majority of samples could be represented with Gaussian distributions . which
also provided better discriminative performances. Hence. the P-Values for
(km) were determined according to the Gaussian distribution. All tests for
signiﬁcance are one-sided. A value of (k,) or (km) is considered to be
signiﬁcant if it is higher than an upper critical value; while a value of l
is signiﬁcant when it is less than a lower critical value.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Capturing the functional relationships of genes
with GO-based graphs

In this research, we studied the functional coherence of gene sets
through the investigation of the relationships between constituent
genes in GO graph space. To this end, we ﬁrst constructed a
GOGraph, which consists of only GO terms (nodes) and their
ontology relationships (edges) as deﬁned by the GO. Then, we added
all annotated genes as nodes to the GOGraph, based on the instances
speciﬁed in the GO database, leading to a graph consisting of both
types of nodes, which is referred to as a GOGeneGraph. During
the process, we further augmented the GOGeneGraph by adding
edges between pairs of GO nodes that were used to co-annotate one
or more genes. After augmentation, a GOGeneGraph was further
transformed into a weighted, undirected graph, of which an edge’s
length was calculated according to the semantic distance between a
pair of GO terms. More details about the graph construction are

available in Section 2 and in a report on the utilized software
package (Muller et a1., 2009). The motivation for augmenting a
GOGeneGraph is that co-annotation by a pair of GO terms, whether
semantically close or remote, is generally biologically meaningful.
Table 1 provides examples of co-annotation instances in yeast. For
example, co-annotation of 25 genes by the two semantically remote
terms, cell death and oxidation reduction, may be puzzling at ﬁrst
glance, but it is less surprising when one understands that many
of the genes involved in oxidation reduction are also involved
in the process of programmed cell death. On the other hand, co-
annotation by the terms with closely related semantic meanings is
understandable as the genes themselves are likely closely related
in function. In both cases, taking co-annotation into account during
ﬁinctional coherence analysis will reﬂect the biological relationships
between GO terms that are not explicitly considered in most previous
GO-based ﬁinction analysis methods.

3.2 Comparing GO graphs across species

To assess if our approach can be broadly applied in different species,
we ﬁrst analyzed the properties of the GO graphs from different
species to determine if their characteristics are comparable across
species, because many GO terms and annotated genes are species-
speciﬁc. Additionally, because the graphical representation of the
GO represents the organization of biological concepts and the gene
annotations reﬂect contemporary knowledge of the biology of genes,
it is of interest to investigate how the concepts and genes are
organized in the gene-concept space. We constructed and studied
species-speciﬁc graphs, corresponding to the biological process
domain of the GO, for three organisms: S.cerevisiae, M.musculus
and H. sapiens, and we then investigated the topological properties
of the graphs for comparison.

A common way to summarize the topology of a graph is to study
the relationship between the node degree k (the number of edges
connected to a node) and the cumulative degree distribution P(k)
(the probability that a node has a degree greater than or equal to k)
in logarithmic scales (Newman, 2003). Figure 2A—C shows that for
the GOGraphs, despite differences in the number of annotations and
genes between species-speciﬁc graphs, the relationship between k
and P(k) can be ﬁtted with a similar power—law curve for all three
species. The similar degree distributions in Figure 2A—C suggest
that biological concepts are organized in a similar fashion across
the organisms. The nearly linear relationships in the panels indicate

that the GOGraphs have the characteristics of scale-free graphs with
a hub-spoke-like organization (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Newman,
2003). With respect to the GO, this means that some concepts
are highly connected and play critical roles in connecting various
concepts. Similarly, the GOGeneGraphs from the three species
have comparable power—law exponents and are thus similar in
architecture (Fig. 2D—F). These results indicate that some GO terms
are used to annotate a large number of genes, and some genes are
connected with multiple GO terms. In addition to degree, histograms
of edge distances are shown (Fig. 2G—I) in order to quantitatively

summarize the semantic relationships among the GO terms. The
overall similarity of the plots for the three species indicates that the
graph properties and, thus, functional coherence metrics based on
these properties, are likely to be applicable to other species with
similar annotation topologies.

3.3 Metrics for capturing functional coherence

Given a set of genes, we extract a subgraph of GOGeneGraph, which
connects the genes through their ﬁinction annotations to reﬂect how
genes are functionally related to each other. We ﬁirther constrain
the subgraph to have the shortest total semantic distance among all
possible subgraphs connecting the genes, which leads to a subgraph
commonly referred to as Steiner tree (see Section 2). In a G0 Steiner
tree, in addition to the GO terms directly associated to the genes, seed
terms, more terms (nodes) may be included to provide connections
among all seed terms. A GO Steiner tree not only reﬂects how
genes are annotated but also represents how the functions of the
genes are related to each other. Thus, the properties of a G0 Steiner
tree can be used to evaluate both aspects of functional coherence—
the enrichment of functional annotations and the relatedness of the
distinct annotations.

Three metrics were devised based on the topological properties of
GO Steiner trees in order to reﬂect the ﬁinctional coherence of a gene
set: the sum of the lengths of all edges within the tree 1, the averaged
seed degree of a tree (ks) and the combined metric (km) = (kit) . The
values of the metrics can be interpreted as follows. A greater (ks)
than expected by random chance indicates a functionally coherent
gene set, because many genes within the set share the same ﬁinction
annotations. A smaller 1 than expected by random chance represents a
functionally coherent gene set, because the annotations of the genes
are semantically or biologically related. Similarly, a greater (km)
than expected denotes a more coherent gene set, because in such
a set either many genes share the same function annotations or the
ﬁinction of the genes are closely related to each other or both. The
quantities measured with these metrics are collectively referred to
as network statistics.

We further investigated if the network statistics were different
between ﬁinctionally coherent gene sets and randomly grouped ones.
By sampling from all annotated genes in a genome, we produced
a large number of randomly grouped gene sets of various sizes to
serve as samples from a population of non-coherent gene sets. For
comparison, we extracted the pathways from the KEGG database
(Kawashima et a1., 2003) and used the corresponding genes as
samples of coherent gene sets. Each network statistic was plotted
as a ﬁinction of the size of the gene sets n, because the values
of the metrics, in particular 1, vary with the size of the gene sets.
Figure 3A—C summarizes the results for the S.cerevisiae data in a
scatter plot. In Figure 3A, (ks) increases as a nonlinear function of
n for random groups, and the data points from the KEGG pathways
signiﬁcantly deviate from the trend of the random sets. Indeed,
most functionally coherent data are above the estimated means (see
Section 2) of the random gene sets with similar sizes, indicating
that the GO terms in the KEGG gene sets are more enriched.
Figure 3B plots 1 as a function of group size n. While the data
exhibit a monotonically increasing function for the random groups,
the lengths (l) of the GO Steiner trees for the KEGG pathways are
signiﬁcantly shorter than those from the random sets, indicating that
the GO terms from the KEGG gene sets are more closely related

(semantically or biologically) than in randomly grouped gene sets.
The results measured by the uniﬁed coherence metric (km), shown
in Figure 3C, also suggest that the groups are separable.

3.4 Statistical testing and discriminative analysis

We ﬁirther evaluate the discriminative power of the metrics in
terms of classiﬁcation accuracy. Our approach was to train a model
that employs a non-parametric regression method to capture the
distributions of the network statistics from randomly sampled gene
sets. Under the null hypothesis that any gene set belongs to the
random gene set population, the trained model can determine the
P-value for an arbitrary gene set—the probability that the set is
comprised of randomly drawn genes. As for the hypothesis testing,
the P-value returned by the model can also be used for discriminative
analysis. In the latter case, the model can ﬁirther classify a gene set
into a coherent or non-coherent class based on a predeﬁned threshold
P-value. Under this setting, the discriminative power of a metric can
be assessed with the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) curve
(Zweig and Campbell, 1993) analysis, in which the area under the

ROC curve (AUC) is used as a measure of discriminative power.
The closer an AUC value is to one, the stronger the discriminative
ability.

We performed ROC analyses for each of the three selected
metrics, (ks), l and (km), using the KEGG pathways as positive
cases and randomly sampled gene sets with corresponding sizes
as negative cases. The results for all three species are shown in
Figure 3D—F. The AUC values are listed in Table 2 for all the
species and for each metric. The results indicate that the graph-
based metrics are highly discriminative, with AUC values >0.9
for S.cerevisiae and H.sapiens. The AUC values for M.m11sc11111s,
although not as high as other two species, can also be considered
excellent. To illustrate the effect of augmenting a GOGeneGraph
with co-annotation edges, Table 2 also compares the AUC values
obtained from GO Steiner trees with and without augmented edges.
This empirically indicates that augmenting GOGeneGraph with co-
annotation edges signiﬁcantly enhances the discriminative power of
our methods.

We noted that by testing against a null distribution of random
sets, our statistical test served directly the goal of evaluating if a
gene set consists of random-grouped genes. As such it transcends
the conventional count-based approaches that concentrate on testing
whether or not an observed GO term in a gene set is a random
event, which is tangentially related to the original goal. As shown
in Figure 3, a P-value of 0.05 from our test serves as an almost
optimal decision threshold for all three metrics in all species. Thus,
this conventional threshold (P< 0.05) of statistical signiﬁcance can
be readily applied in our statistical test, whereas in the count-based
methods one often needs to adjust the signiﬁcance threshold to avoid
false positive calls (Cho et a1., 2001; Huang et a1., 2009; Khatri and
Draghici, 2005; Man et a1., 2000).

3.5 Robustness of the metrics

It is inevitable that results from high-throughput approaches contain
noise of varying degrees. To evaluate the robustness of the metrics
against noise, we performed a noise simulation experiment by
replacing different percentages of the genes from KEGG pathways
with randomly selected ones, followed by the evaluation of the
metrics’ discriminative power. As an example, we studied the
discriminative power of the uniﬁed metric ((k,s)) tested with

threshold at 0.05, we examined the percent of KEGG pathways
that were classiﬁed as coherent after introducing different degrees
of noise. The results are plotted as a function of the percent
of noise in Figure 4A. Our metric classiﬁed the majority of the
lightly contaminated (noise <30%) KEGG gene sets as coherent
and the heavily contaminated (noise >60%) ones as non-coherent.
The ROC curves in the presence of different amounts of noise for
S. cerevisiae, M.m11sc11111s and H. sapiens are shown in Figure 4B—D,
respectively. Overall, the ﬁgure shows that (km) retains a high degree
of discriminative power, even with a relatively large amount of noise
under these simulation conditions.

3.6 Application to microarray gene expression analysis

To evaluate the performance of the metrics at a systems level, we
investigated the metrics developed in this study using a real world
microarray dataset. We collected microarray data from yeast cells
subjected to oxidative stress (see Supplementary Methods), and the
k-means clustering algorithm (Tavazoie et a1., 1999) was employed
to partition the genes into 225 clusters, among which 132 clusters
had a number of genes that fell between 5 and 300. These clusters
were ﬁirther investigated using our GO Steiner tree methods. We
assess the performance of the methods in several ways (Fig. 5).
We investigated the relationship between the P-values produced
by graph-based metrics and cluster size (Fig. 5A). As a comparison,
we also calculated the enrichment P-values of each GO term

that were statistically signiﬁcant (50.05) as determined by a GSA method.
(B) The relationship between signiﬁcance calls by (km) and silhouette index.

within each group was plotted.

within the clusters based on a hypergeometric assumption (Cho
et a1., 2001; Kong et a1., 2006), and an averaged P-value of the
cluster was determined and subsequently plotted in Figure 5A. The
P-values from the GO term enrichment analysis are often sensitive
to geneome size and the extent of annotation completeness (Khatri
and Draghici, 2005). Similarly, if these methods are extended to
evaluate global ﬁinctional coherence of a gene set as by simple
averaging of P-values the results can be shown to be sensitive
to the gene set sizes. The averaged P-values by the count-based
metric showed a clear trend as a nearly linear function of the size
of the clusters; in contrast, the P-values from the graph-based
metric span a broader range, indicating cluster size has little if
any impact on its coherence evaluation. The results conﬁrm a
well-known phenomenon that GO terms observed within a small
cluster are more likely to be evaluated as ‘enriched’ due to the
characteristics of hypergeometric distribution (Khatri and Draghici,
2005; Zheng and Lu, 2007). The panel also shows that the clusters
evaluated as signiﬁcant by the graph-based metric tend to be rich
with differentially expressed genes per a gene set analysis (GSA)
method (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007).

To ﬁirther investigate the results, we assessed how well
the graph-based ﬁinctional coherence evaluations agree with a
metric commonly used to measure similarity of proﬁles within a
cluster—the silhouette index (Rousseeuw, 1987). An underpinning
assumption for many microarray analysis methods is that closely
co-regulated genes, whose expression proﬁles are tightly clustered
within a gene set (reﬂected as a high silhouette index) are likely
to ﬁinction coherently (Eisen et a1., 1998). The results (Fig. 5B)
indicate that, as the silhouette value increases, a cluster is more
likely to be evaluated as signiﬁcant by the graph-based metric.

Lastly, we assessed the functional coherence of the clusters by
manually studying their annotations and their GO Steiner trees.
We found that according to expert assessment, many biologically
coherent clusters were correctly classiﬁed by the graph-based metric.

Fig. 6. Steiner tree Visualization. (A) An example of GO Steiner tree
Visualization for a gene cluster involved in retinal degeneration. Oval nodes
are GO term nodes. with cyan ovals representing the seed terms and open
ovals denoting the GO terms needed to connect all seed terms. A black
edge represents the semantic edge deﬁned in the GOGraph and a red edge
is an augmenting edge representing the connection between GO terms
that co-annotate proteins. A gene is represented with a black box and the
dashed edges denote gene-to-term relationship. Summarizing annotation
descriptions are displayed as text. The whole gene expression cluster takes
the form of several distinct groups. (B) One group (subgraph) of interest is
examined more closely to highlight the characteristics of a more functionally
coherent part of the overall GO Steiner tree. The G0 terms labeled with a
number are further explained in the Supplementary Results.

For example, our graph-based evaluation correctly called a cluster
of genes rich with ribosomal proteins as coherent gene set, thus
conforming with well-documented knowledge that the expressions
of these genes are signiﬁcantly and coordinately repressed during
various cellular stresses (Gasch and Wemer—Washburne, 2002).
Overall, the results demonstrate the ability of this method to ﬁlter
through large amounts of potentially interesting gene sets in order
to focus on those of relevant biological interest.

3.7 Visualization

Visualization provides another means to assess the functional
coherence of a gene set beyond solely relying on P-values.
Visualization allows for the generation of new hypotheses based
on the ﬁinctional groupings of genes and terms and the way they
are connected, and equally important it may be used to conﬁrm
existing knowledge about the underlying biology. To this end, we
have implemented a web application.

As an example to illustrate the utility of visualization, we explored
the GO Steiner tree for a set of genes published in a study on retina
degeneration (Rohrer et a1., 2004) (Fig. 6). An evaluation with (km)
resulted in a signiﬁcant P-value of 0.043, suggesting that the GO
terms from the gene set are more coherent than random. Indeed,
when inspecting the GO Steiner tree for the gene set, we found that
there are two major clusters of nodes consisting of both genes and

A.J.Richards et al.

 

GO terms. One cluster consists of 99 GO terms associated with one
gene, Drd2, while another is comprised of 7 genes and 18 highly
connected GO terms. Visualization thus enabled, in this case of this
cluster, the user to focus in immediately on the most biologically
interesting part of the GO Steiner tree. Observing the clusters also
helped to explain why the gene set was considered statistically
signiﬁcant, supporting the idea that exploring a G0 Steiner tree is
an efﬁcient means to facilitates ﬁinctional investigation.

Visualization helped us derive the following biological thoughts
and insights. The animal model analyzed here is the rd] mouse
(Farber, 1995), a very well-studied model for retinitis pigmentosa
(RP), a disease resulting in rod photoreceptor degeneration. Many
pathophysiological aspects of the disease model were correctly
recognized by the GO terms phototransduction, ion transport,
apoptosis regulation and cone development. Photoreceptor cell death
in this model can be slowed down using doparninergic agonists
(regulation of dopamine), which provides the rationale for Drd2
(Ogilvie and Speck, 2002). It is known that the photoreceptor
cell death leads to cytoskeleton reorganization and changes in
protein localization both within the dying cell as well as in the
remaining surviving cells. Visualization provides the user with a
method to investigate functional subgraphs of a G0 Steiner tree.
For example, by visualizing the ﬁinctional cluster subplot (Fig. 6B)
it is easier to tease out the relationships between genes and terms
than it is with a list of annotations alone. The subplot along with
the annotation descriptions (see Supplemental Results) provide the
genes associated with the cells surviving initial apoptotic events.
These cells reorganize into a novel network due to migration and
proliferation of certain cell types (Marc et a1., 2007). Because, no
links exist yet for ch2 and Thy] in photoreceptor degeneration, this
leads to the generation of hypotheses that may be used to characterize
their roles in the rd] model and ultimately in RP. There are grounds
for ﬁirther investigation, because ch2 is expressed in the retina
(Liu et a1., 2006) during development and Thy] is crucial for retinal
development (Simon et a1., 1999).

4 DISCUSSION

The main goal of this study was to introduce functional coherence
metrics with high levels of discriminative power, based on the
currently available GO annotations. Moreover, the method was
intentionally developed independent of data types that are used
to generate the gene set of interest (GOI). Two graph-based
metrics, (ks) and l, were developed, where the former measures the
enrichment of ﬁinctional annotations, and the latter summarizes the
relatedness of the annotations. Furthermore, (km) was devised so that
both aspects of functional coherence can be evaluated with a uniﬁed
metric. In addition to quantitative evaluation, we have also provided
tools to visualize GO Steiner trees as a means to ﬁirther assess the
results by inspecting how genes and annotations are organized, rather
than solely relying on P-values. In the real world application, the
metrics returned biologically sensible calls. The advantages of these
metrics include but are not necessarily limited to the following:
(i) by incorporating semantic and biological relationships in the
evaluation, our methods treat genes annotated with semantically
close GO terms as functionally similar; (ii) providing an global
evaluation method for proteins/gene sets, rather than treating each
ﬁinction annotation of genes as independent; and (iii) addressing the
multiple testing problem by reducing the number of tests. However,

like all GO-based evaluation methods, the metrics are dependent on
how well genes are annotated. Therefore, the utilities of the metrics
are limited when considering species that have less comprehensive
annotations, and the metrics may reﬂect potential annotation biases
from the databases. This is likely to hold true for localized areas of
the GOGraph as well.

The discriminative power of the graph-based metrics may be
attributed to the following factors. First, the methods capture
the key properties that differentiate coherent gene sets from
random ones—GO terms in a functionally coherent gene set are
more likely to be enriched and their functions are more closely
related semantically and biologically. In addition to the semantic
relationships considered, our metrics ﬁirther take into account the
relationships among GO terms that co-annotate genes, which leads
to a better performance. Second, through a sampling approach, our
method accurately estimates the distribution of network statistics of
the randomly grouped gene sets, which is directly relevant to the task
at hand—determining if an arbitrary gene set consists of randomly
grouped genes.

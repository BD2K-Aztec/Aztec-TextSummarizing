for screening, iterative screening fails to identify the combin—
ations of two knockouts that show higher production yields
only when they are disrupted simultaneously. To overcome this
drawback, several systematic screening methods have been de—
veloped, such as OptGene (Patil et al., 2005), OptFlux (Rocha
et al., 2010), Genetic Design through Local Search (GDLS) (Lun
et al., 2009) and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (Link
et al., 2008). For example, OptGene uses a genetic algorithm to
search the vast solution space to obtain optimal knockout sets.
Using these approaches, sets of reaction knockouts that improve
the target production have been successfully identiﬁed with rela—
tively small computational costs. However, if the target produc—
tion yields are used for the screening score, it is often difﬁcult to
identify which sets of multiple knockouts cause the target pro—
duction that occurs only when the knockouts are done simultan—
eously. One possible strategy for this problem is to use a
screening score that reﬂects the potential a knockout has to in—
crease the production yields in concert with other knockouts.

In the present study, we developed a new iterative screening
algorithm, fast glgorithm of knockout screening for target
Eduction based on shadow price analysis (FastPros), which
uses biomass production maximization to identify sets of meta—
bolic reactions whose simultaneous knockouts result in the pro—
duction of a target metabolite. In this algorithm, we adopted a
novel score for iterative knockout screening based on the change
in biomass production ﬂux caused by a slight increase in the
target production ﬂux, uTARGET. This value corresponds to the
shadow price of the constraint of the target—metabolite produc—
tion ﬂux in the linear programming problem. We demonstrate
that uTARGET represents the potential of target production
and increasing this value by iterative screening of the reaction
knockouts generates sets of knockouts that realize the target
production. Furthermore, we show that combining FastPros
with another tool, OptKnock, provides further improvement of
the target production.

2 METHODS

2.1 Genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli

As an original metabolic model, we used a GSM of E.coli K-12 MG1655
named iAFl260 (Feist et al., 2007), which contains 1260 open reading
frames from the latest genome annotation and over 2000 transport and
intracellular reactions. To evaluate the production potential of each cyto-
solic metabolite in this GSM, we added a transport reaction of the target
metabolite if it was absent in the original model, which was assumed to be
diffusion transport.

To reduce the computational cost of FBA-based screening, we con-
structed simpliﬁed metabolic models based on our previous study (Ohno
et al., 2013), which provides identical ﬂux estimations and screening re-
sults to the original model. Brieﬂy, we ﬁrst identiﬁed metabolic reactions
whose maximum and minimum ﬂuxes were zero under given environ-
mental conditions by ﬂux variability analysis (Mahadevan and Schilling,
2003) and then removed these reactions from the original model to which
target metabolite transporters were added. Second, adjacent metabolic
reactions without branching were combined into a single lumped reac-
tion, as the knockout of adjacent reactions results in an identical effect on
the ﬂux changes. Third, we identiﬁed combined reactions encoded by the
same gene sets, as these reactions cannot be separately disrupted in ex-
periments. Finally, knockouts of the reactions encoded by gapA, pgk, em
and gpmA were removed from reaction sets, as their reactions appear

essential in viva (Baba et al., 2006; Foster et al., 2010). Because the
reduced models, including lumped metabolic reactions, were used for
the knockout screening, we describe below a knockout using a represen-
tative reaction in the lumped reaction.

2.2 Flux balance analysis

Constraint-based FBA was performed based on previous studies (Ohno
et al., 2013; Orth et al., 2010; Shinfuku et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, a pseudo-
steady state of the metabolic proﬁle was assumed, i.e. the net sum of all
production and consumption metabolic ﬂuxes for each internal metabol-
ite was set to zero. This assumption resulted in a feasible space that was a
convex set in the N-dimensional space of metabolic ﬂuxes (where N
stands for the total number of ﬂuxes). In FBA, a particular objective
function written as a linear combination of ﬂuxes can be used to calculate
the optimal solution at one corner in the feasible ﬂux space. In this study,
we used the maximization of biomass production ﬂux as the objective
function. After obtaining the maximal biomass production ﬂux by linear
programming, we further maximized the production ﬂux of target me-
tabolites under ﬁxed biomass production ﬂux on the maximal value to
avoid alternative production ﬂux.

For all simulations, glucose was used as the sole carbon source, and its
uptake rate was set to 10 mmol/gDW/h. The oxygen uptake rate was set to
5 mmol/gDW/h, which corresponds to a microaerobic condition, i.e. the
oxygen uptake is insufﬁcient to oxidize all NADH produced in glycolysis
and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the electron transfer system. This rela-
tively low oxygen uptake rate was chosen, as higher production yields of
target metabolites can be obtained under these conditions, in comparison
with the higher oxygen uptake rate when carbon is mainly used to generate
biomass and C02. Other external metabolites such as C02 and NH3 were
allowed to be freely transported through the cell membrane in accordance
with a previous study (Feist et al., 2007). All calculations, including linear
programming problems, were run using GNU Linear Programming Kit
(GLPK) (www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) and MATLAB on a Windows ma-
chine with Intel Xeon 2.66 GHz processors.

2.3 uTARGET: a novel score for knockout screening

Consider the case in which the production ﬂux of a target metabolite is
zero under biomass ﬂux maximization. In this case, the increase in the
target production ﬂux from zero ﬂux brings about a decrease in the bio-
mass production ﬂux. In contrast, if the target is produced under biomass
production maximization, it corresponds to the case that an increase in
the target production ﬂux increases the biomass production ﬂux. The
change in biomass production ﬂux caused by the increase in target pro-
duction ﬂux is a useful measure to represent the potential of the target
production. In this study, we deﬁned the potential of the target produc-
tion, uTARGET, as follows:

A Vgrmrth

“TARGET = y
A Vturge!

where Avgrmm, is the change in biomass production ﬂux caused by the
increase in the target production ﬂux by Avmwm from zero ﬂux. When
uTARGET is positive, the target is produced under the biomass production
maximization, whereas if it is negative, the target is not produced. Here,
the absolute value of uTARGET represents the difﬁculty of altering the sign
of this value. When uTARGET is a small negative value close to zero, a
change in its sign can be effected relatively easily by the addition of a
single reaction knockout. In contrast, when the value is large and nega-
tive, the probability of ﬁnding a reaction knockout that changes the sign
of uTARGET is small. The essence of FastPros is to use uTARGET as a score
for iterative knockout screening. Even if uTARGET of the wild-type meta-
bolic network is a large negative value, the iterative screening of single
reaction knockouts that increase this value can result in approaching a

FastPros: knockout screening for metabolic engineering

 

growth. Even if a strain after the predicted reaction knockouts is
successfully constructed, it can remain in a non—optimal metabolic
state. Conﬂicts between experiments and in silico predictions can
be eliminated by experimental evolution. Several studies have
demonstrated that when a microorganism strain is cultured for
an extended period to select individuals with optimized growth
under a given condition, the realized ﬂux proﬁle gradually
approaches the calculated optimal ﬂux proﬁle (Fong et al.,
2005; Lewis et al., 2010). The combination of in silico screening
and experimental evolution that achieves an optimal ﬂux profile
experimentally is a potentially practical application for obtaining
valuable strains for bioproduction.

In conclusion, we have developed a novel computational al—
gorithm, FastPros, that accelerates microbial strain improvement
and have demonstrated the applicability of FastPros to cell—wide
metabolite productions in E.coli. uTARGET was adopted as the
screening score to identify those reaction knockouts that have
greater potential for target metabolite production. This score
could be readily calculated as a shadow price in modiﬁed FBA
simulations. We identiﬁed numerous metabolites in E.coli whose
production was enhanced under biomass production maximiza—
tion only when multiple reactions were simultaneously knocked
out. We expect that our algorithm and the concept of uTARGET
will improve metabolic engineering technologies and facilitate
biological production of a broad range of valuable chemicals.

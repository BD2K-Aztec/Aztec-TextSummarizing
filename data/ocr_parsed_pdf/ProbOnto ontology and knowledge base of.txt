Abstract

Motivation: Probability distributions play a central role in mathematical and statistical modelling.
The encoding, annotation and exchange of such models could be greatly simplified by a resource
providing a common reference for the definition of probability distributions. Although some re—
sources exist, no suitably detailed and complex ontology exists nor any database allowing pro—
grammatic access.

Results: ProbOnto, is an ontology—based knowledge base of probability distributions, featuring
more than 80 uni— and multivariate distributions with their defining functions, characteristics, rela—
tionships and re—parameterization formulas. It can be used for model annotation and facilitates the

 

encoding of distribution—based models, related functions and quantities.

1 Introduction

When encoding probabilistic uncertainties using a given parametric
distribution, its name and parameters are usually sufficient to spe-
cify the intended distribution unambiguously, as in many cases such
parameter set is unique. However, in multiple cases, two or more
parameterizations exist and it becomes essential to specify correctly
the parameters for the distribution in order to obtain the correct
model. A well-structured, independent, standard reference would
greatly facilitate the specification of a distribution and its declar-
ation in a programming language or exchange format as is shown by
interoperability issues between tools with distributions differing in
their parameterizations (LeBauer et (11., 2013).

Many resources are available online (Dinov et (11., 2015; Williams
et (11., 2008), as tools (Marichev and Trott, 2013) and in printed format
(Forbes et (11., 2011; Johnson et (11., 2005; Leemis and Mcqueston,
2008) but a comprehensive ontology which formalizes the theory of
kinds and relations of probability distributions does not yet exist.

Some Bioportal (Noy et (11., 2009) ontologies provide a simple
classification and little information; in most cases parameters, defin-
ing functions, or quantities are not defined and information about

the relationships between distributions is not available. Such ontolo-
gies, because of their simplicity, are insufficient for our purposes
and it is the same with existing databases of distributions.

2 Methods

We compiled an initial ‘common denominator’ collection of para-
metric distributions from UncertML (Williams et (11., 2008) and
Matlab Statistical Toolbox (MathWorks, 2015) and then extended
this set to cover models used in various statistical modelling areas,
in particular, pharmacometrics. A number of important and more
exotic discrete data models were treated with alternative versions of
the Negative Binomial and the Generalized Poisson, or the Conway—
Maxwell—Poisson distribution.

We further included all distributions and relevant parameter-
izations used in the following tools: Monolix (Lixoft Team, 2014),
NONMEM (Beal et (11., 2009) and winBUGS (Lunn et (11., 2009),
and a few found in MCSim (Bois, 2010). We completed this collec-
tion with many relationships/re-parameterizations between distribu-
tions (Leemis and Mcqueston, 2008).

M.J.Swat et al.

 

We used the following sources to populate the database with
probability functions, their relationships and quantities: Forbes
et al. (2011), Johnson et al. (2005) and the probability distribution
pages of the Wikipedia.

The following list summarizes the features of ProbOnto 1.0

° Over 80 uni— and multivariate distributions and alternative
parameterizations.

° Probability density or mass functions and available cumulative
distribution, hazard and survival functions.

° Supports encoding of univariate mixture distributions.

° Over 130 relationships and re—parameterization formulas.

° Related quantities such as mean, median, mode and variance.

° Parameter and support/range deﬁnitions and distribution type.

° Latex and R code for mathematical functions.

LeBauer et al. (2013) showed that re—parameterizations between
related distributions are essential for the interoperability between
existing tools using only two tools and five distributions. ProbOnto
extended coverage in this respect beyond proof of concept with a
wider scope and number of tools and distributions. ProbOnto con—
tains, for example, six alternative parameterizations of the log—nor—
mal or five of the negative binomial distribution, all in use in
different contexts. Scientists and tool developers can look all these
up in ProbOnto (Supplementary Material).

3 Ontological model

ProbOnto is a knowledge base built from a simple ontological
model. At its core, a probability distribution is an instance of the
class thereof, a specialization of the class of mathematical objects. A
distribution relates to a number of other individuals, which are in—
stances of various categories in the ontology. For example, these are
parameters and related functions associated with a given probability
distribution. This strategy allows for the rich representation of attri—
butes and relationships between domain objects. The ontology can
be seen as a conceptual schema in the domain of mathematics and
has been implemented as a PowerLoom (MacGregor et al., 1997)
knowledge base. An OWL version is generated programmatically
using the Jena API (McBride, 2001). Output for ProbOnto are pro—
vided as supplementary materials and published on or linked from
the ProbOnto website. The OWL version of ProbOnto is available
via Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) to facilitate simple searching
and visualization of the content (Jupp et al., 2015). In addition the
OLS API provides methods to programmatically access ProbOnto
and to integrate it into applications.

4 Use case

ProbOnto was first designed to facilitate the encoding of nonlinear
mixed effect models and their annotation in PharmML,
Pharmacometrics Markup Language, (Swat et al., 2015) developed
by DDMoRe (Harnisch et al., 2013). The scope and features of the
language made ProbOnto invaluable in encoding of diverse models
applicable to discrete (e.g. count, categorical and time—to—event) and
continuous data (Supplementary Material).

Despite its PharmML original context, ProbOnto is purpose in—
dependent and does not put implementation constraints on tool de—
signers, thus allowing an open ended number of usage scenarios.

When using ProbOnto with PharmML, a small generic XML
schema was enough to allow for flexible encoding of distributions
relevant in pharmacometric modelling, their parameters and

functions (see Supplementary Material, Appendix). The following
example shows how the negative binomial distribution is encoded
by using its codename and declaring that of its parameters (‘rate’
and ‘overdispersion’).

<Distribution >
<po:ProbOnto name:“NegativeBinomialZ”>
<po:Parameter namez“ rate” >
<ct:Assign>
<ct:SymbRef symbIdRefz“lambda”/>
</ct:Assign>
</po:Parameter>
<po:Parameter namez“overdispersion”>
<ct:Assign>
<ct:SymbRef symbIdRefz“tau”/>
</ct:Assign>
</po:Parameter>
</po:ProbOnto>
</Distriution >

To specify any given distribution unambiguously using
ProbOnto, it is sufficient to declare its code name and the code
names of its parameters.

5 Future plans and conclusions

ProbOnto provides a means for the encoding and annotation of stat—
istical models, thus facilitating their exchange between software
tools. Due to its generic construction which does not enforce a spe—
cific implementation in target software, ProbOnto can be applied
across various modelling platforms and databases.

Although it already incorporates a high number of distributions,
this collection is still growing with new distributions added on regu—
lar basis; ProbOnto will ultimately include all distributions sup—
ported by tools such as STAN (STAN Development Team, 2015)
and R (R Core Team, 2015). In the future, additional features will
extend the knowledge base such as applications of a probability dis—
tribution, its mathematical properties, such as linear combination,
convolution and scaling (Leemis and Mcqueston, 2008) and related
data type.

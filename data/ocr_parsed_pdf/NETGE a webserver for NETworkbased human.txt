Abstract

Motivation: Gene enrichment is a requisite for the interpretation of biological complexity related to
specific molecular pathways and biological processes. Furthermore, when interpreting NGS data
and human variations, including those related to pathologies, gene enrichment allows the inclu—
sion of other genes that in the human interactome space may also play important key roles in the
emergency of the phenotype. Here, we describe NET—GE, a web server for associating biological
processes and pathways to sets of human proteins involved in the same phenotype

Results: NET—GE is based on protein—protein interaction networks, following the notion that for a
set of proteins, the context of their specific interactions can better define their function and the
processes they can be related to in the biological complexity ofthe cell. Our method is suited to ex—
tract statistically validated enriched terms from Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME annotation
databases. Furthermore, NET—GE is effective even when the number of input proteins is small.
Availability and Implementation: NET—GE web server is publicly available and accessible at http://
net—ge.biocomp.unibo.it/enrich.

1 Introduction

Big Data production in biomedicine is rapidly changing the way in
which molecular knowledge is translated into health care (Bender,
2015). The spread and establishment of High Throughput Sequencing
(HTS) technologies allows retrieving lists of interesting variations
characterizing the investigated phenotype. In the context of functional
genomics, each phenotype needs annotations for reconciling vari-
ations with known and putatively common biological processes and
pathways, such as Gene Ontology (GO Consortium, 2015), KEGG
(Kanehisa et (11., 2016), REACTOME (Fabregat et (11., 2016). At this
level of biological complexity, a set of genes and their variations can
acquire biological meaning and feature annotation only with an

enrichment procedure (Laukens et (11., 2015). Enrichment helps in
identifying within a set of genes some statistically significant and
over-represented annotation features. Standard enrichment methods
rely on the statistical over representation of the annotations that
characterize the genes in the input set. Alternatively, network-based
approaches extract graph properties from different interaction net-
works and pathways for modelling the complexity of the processes
occurring in the cell and exploit this information for accomplishing
the annotation enrichment in the context of protein functional inter-
action. Lists of web sites are available (Huang et (11., 2009; Laukens
et (11., 2015; Mooney and Wilmot, 2015). Here, we introduce NET-
GE, a web server that implements our method (Di Lena et 111.,

Abstract

Motivation: Dispersed duplications (DDs) such as transposon element insertions and copy number
variations are ubiquitous in the human genome. They have attracted the interest of biologists as
well as medical researchers due to their role in both evolution and disease. The efforts of discover—
ing DDs in high—throughput sequencing data are currently dominated by database—oriented
approaches that require pre—existing knowledge ofthe DD elements to be detected.

Results: We present DDiDETECTION, a database—free approach to finding DD events in high—throughput
sequencing data. DDiDETECTION is able to detect DDs purely from paired—end read alignments. We show
in a comparative study that this method is able to compete with database—oriented approaches in re—
covering validated transposon insertion events. We also experimentally validate the predictions of
DDiDETECTION on a human DNA sample, showing that it can find not only duplicated elements present
in common databases but also DDs of novel type.

1 Introduction

 

The term dispersed duplication (DD) denotes any DNA sequence
duplicated non-locally in a genome. DDs include copies of transpos-
able elements such as members of the Ala and Ll families, which are
ubiquitous in the human genome, but also less frequent duplications
such as chromosomal translocations and copies of mitochondrial
DNA sequences embedded in nuclear DNA. DDs are very common,
as estimates show that known transposable elements comprise
nearly 50% of the human genome (Lander et (11., 2001). An arbi-
trary human sample may contain upwards of 1000 DDs compared
to the reference genome (Stewart et (11., 2011).

DDs have been found to be disruptive to the genome, altering
gene expression and sometimes causing disease (Kazazian et (11.,
1988; Miki et (11., 1996). This type of structural variation has often
been considered in cohort studies aiming to link phenotypes to
causal variants. Consequently, there has been an increased effort in
developing methodologies to uncover genetic variation beyond the
single nucleotide level.

The advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing provides a new
information source for genetic variant discovery that is both fast
and is steadily becoming less expensive. However, whole-genome
sequencing output is typically bulky and non-trivial to analyze,

threshold (r, : mate(r;) and (pos(ri) —pos(r;)( > 0) are marked
discordant and are collected for further processing. The threshold
parameter 0 ensures that the algorithm focuses on dispersed events
rather than small or local variations.

The collected discordantly aligned reads are subsequently clus—
tered by strand and by alignment position. Two reads (r,, r,) are as—
signed to the same cluster C Q S if chr(r,~) : chr(r,~) and
strand(ri) : strand(r;) and (pos(ri) — pos(r;)(£5. The value of 6
determines how close two reads must be aligned to be in the same
cluster. 5 is manually configurable and allows control over the num—
ber of times reads are mistakenly clustered together or conversely as—
signed to the same cluster while not supporting the same DD event.
The expected number of such mistakes also depends on read cover—
age and on the size characteristics of the paired—end read fragments
(F15, FRL). The algorithm also enforces a maximum on the size
of the region that is spanned on the reference genome by its read
alignments to avoid adding reads bearing signals from different
duplication events to the same cluster. Formally, a cluster C is
invalid if
3,,EC,,/Ec(pos(ri) — pos(r,~)( > FIS — FRL.

While clustering, the reads are traversed in order of their align—
ment position on the genome, assigning them to clusters one at a
time. New clusters are created for the first read and every read that
cannot be assigned to an existing cluster without invalidating it by
the definition described above. Afterward, a noise threshold or is
applied such that all clusters of insufficient size (Cl < or are

discarded.

2.2 Finding breakpoints

Having found clusters of discordant reads, the algorithm estimates
for each cluster the breakpoint location of the putative DD.
Estimation of the breakpoint is done using a split read signal pro—
vided by applying the pattern growth algorithm locally. This algo—
rithm was first described by Pei et al. (2001) and has successfully
been used in finding patterns in biological sequence data (e.g. Ye et
41., 2007, 2009; Zhang et 41., 2012). In the context of finding DDs,
pattern growth is used to find partial alignments of reads (i.e. split
reads) overlapping the insertion breakpoint.

To find a breakpoint for a specific cluster C with reads aligned
to the forward strand, the left—most alignment position m : minrec
pos(r) is determined. Given m, the algorithm finds reads r. E S for
which mate(r*) is not aligned or only partially aligned to the refer—
ence and pos(r*) + FRL is within the range [m — FISJn + 21315] (i.e.
a region around the far end of the site spanned by the cluster on the
reference genome). For every r. the pattern growth algorithm is
applied to mate(r*) in the local area on the reference genome to find
a partial alignment. If such a partial alignment is found, a putative
breakpoint is announced at the last aligned position before the read
starts to diverge from the reference. Any announced breakpoint is
discarded if it is not at least supported by or partial alignments or if
the previously unaligned parts of the split reads can be aligned lo—
cally in the genome (in a :0 region around the breakpoint). For
clusters with reads aligned to the reverse strand of the reference gen—
ome, a similar approach is used, the right—most aligned position
being found by m : maxrec pos(r) + FRL and using [m — 2Fls,m
+1315] as the range that must overlap with pos(r*) + FRL.

If no breakpoint is found using split reads, it will be estimated
directly from the alignments of the reads in the cluster. Given a

cluster C with reads (r1.  .r(c() aligned to the forward strand

ordered by alignment position, a breakpoint is estimated by

 

(Cl—1

pos(r(c() + FRL + ‘C‘ _ 1 Z (P030941) — 1303(0))-
i:1

For clusters with reads aligning to the reverse strand, the break—
point is calculated in similar fashion by subtracting the average dis—
tance between reads from the position of the left—most read.

2.3 Calling DD insertions

In the final step of the algorithm, DD events are called if they are
supported by breakpoints from two clusters, one with reads aligned
to the forward strand and one with reads aligned to the reverse
strand of the reference genome. Two such breakpoints are assumed
to support the same event if they are not further apart than /1 base—
pairs on the same chromosome. Specifically, the duplication events
are discovered by combining consecutive breakpoints from an array
of breakpoints sorted by their position on the genome.

The resulting DD events are reported with the position on the
genome estimated from read clusters on both strands, the supporting
discordant reads (i.e. those that map inside the element), the sup—
porting split reads and the alignment positions of the discordant
reads to the reference genome as provided in the input (i.e. positions
indicating alternative copies of the DD elements).

3 Results

We implemented the method presented in the previous section and
named it DD_DETECTION. The program is easy to use, configurable
and capable of processing whole—genome sequencing input on a
modern desktop computer system. For example, on a regular system
(4—core 2.4GHz processor, 8 GB memory) with human whole—
genome sequencing data (40>< coverage) as input, running
DD_DETECTION with four threads and otherwise default parameters
takes 127 min and consumes approximately 2.5 GB peak physical
(9.3 GB peak virtual) memory. The C++ source of the program to—
gether with installation instructions can be found online at https://
bitbucket.org/mkroon/dd_detection.

We have used DD_DETECTION to investigate the performance of
our method for both medium and high—coverage human DNA align—
ment data. DD events called on publicly available data from the
1000 Genomes project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2012) are used to compare the performance of DD_DETECTION to that
of alternative methods. We also applied DD_DETECTION to a two—
sample human dataset and validated in corresponding DNA samples
a number of calls for both known transposon elements and elements
not present in common databases.

3.1 Comparing methods in a human sample

We used a well—studied human sample from the 1000 Genomes project
(The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) to compare our method
against recent methods for finding transposon insertions. The particu—
lar public dataset used for this sample (NA12878, ftp://ftp.1000genomes.
ebi.ac.uk/Vo103204/ftp/technica1/working/20101201_cg_NA12878) con—
tains paired—end reads from the Illumina HiSeq platform for the whole
genome with approximately 200>< coverage. The read data were re—
aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37 using BWA (Li and
Durbin, 2009). DD_DETECTION was run with 0 : 8000 bp, or : 10, 6
: 250 bp and compared to two alternative methods: RetroSeq (Keane et

210 (11.5%) to be novel, as they were not reported in previous lit—
erature (using Hormozdiari et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Stewart et
al., 2011; Wang et al., 2006 as reference). Furthermore, 436
(23.9%) of these events were called with split read support.

DD calls from both the group of novel events and known events
were selected randomly for validation. For each selected event, poly—
merase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to amplify the region of
the DNA containing the putative insertion. As the breakpoints may
be imprecise, the primers were designed to be at least 15 0 bp away
from the nearest breakpoint estimation. Before validation, the pre—
dicted length of the elements to be extracted was estimated from the
alignment of the discordant read pairs supporting the corresponding
event and from information provided by the Repbase Update trans—
poson database if the particular event could be classified as a known
transposon type. The actual length of the inserted elements was
determined via gel electrophoresis on the PCR products. If the meas—
ured length of a product concurred with the estimated element
length, the product was isolated and sequenced inwards from both
directions using Sanger sequencing. The resulting sequences were
aligned to the human reference genome using BLAT (Kent, 2002).
We state that an event is validated when BLAT returns an incom—
plete alignment near the putative breakpoint with the remaining
part of the sequence aligning to the consensus sequence of the elem—
ent type as identified by RepeatMasker for the respective event or
when the rest of the sequence corresponds to the supporting reads of
the event and their alignment to the reference genome.

Validation results for nine events with elements from the
Repbase Update database are listed in Table 1. Seven of the selected
events were validated successfully. Detailed information on the se—
lected events and validation experiments can be found in
(Supplementary Table 51). Pictures of electrophoresis on the PCR
products are shown in Supplementary Figs 51—54.

3.2.2 Validation of DD events with non-database elements
DD_DETECTION found 177 events that were classified as neither pre—
sent in the transposon element database nor arising from regions of
low complexity. Fifty—five events (31.1%) were detected in both
samples, while 57 (32.2%) events were unique for sample A and 65
(36.7%) events were unique for sample C. Twenty—two (12%) of
these DDs were supported by split reads.

Eight events with non—database elements were selected for valid—
ation. We preferred events that were well—supported by discordant

the events were validated successfully. Details on the selected events
and validation can be found in Supplementary Table 51 and Figs
51—54.

4 Discussion and conclusion

We presented DD_DETECTION, a new method to detect dispersed
duplicated DNA, an important but relatively neglected type of struc—
tural variation. The method uses the alignment information of
paired—end reads to find non—reference duplications, thereby not
relying on a predefined database of duplicated elements. As a soft—
ware package, DD_DETECTION is publicly available and has few re—
quirements for installation.

In a comparative study on public high—coverage data,
DD_DETECTION was able to compete with database—oriented methods
in finding new transposon insertions. Analysis of DDS called in me—
dium coverage data shows that DD_DETECTION is able to find both
new transposon insertions of known type as well as other DD inser—
tion events with elements not present in common databases. A num—
ber of novel DD events and DD events with non—database elements
were successfully validated using PCR and Sanger sequencing.

Predictions made by DD_DETECTION for a human twin pair
showed a discrepancy between both samples that is larger than one
may expect for near identical genomes. Additionally, we noticed
that low—complexity regions in the genome caused false—positive
calls. We think these problems are part of the trade—off that comes
with avoiding an external database of duplication elements. While it
allows our method to call events with non—database elements, it can—
not use information from a database to discard false calls. We
showed a simple post—processing step with the RepeatMasker
tool (Smit et al., 1996) that we used to filter some of these false
positives.

In the future, we want to focus on decreasing the false—positive
rate, either by extending the pipeline with a filtering step for low—
complexity DNA or by incorporating such filtering into the method.
Another goal is to have the algorithm find optimal parameter values
automatically given the input data. Currently, as a general guide
line, the value of or should not be lower than 3, to keep control over
the false—positive rate. In case of low coverage data, 5 and 2 can
be increased to gain sensitivity. A more detailed explanation of
the effects of parameter settings is given in the software
documentation.

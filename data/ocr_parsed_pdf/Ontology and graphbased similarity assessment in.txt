ABSTRACT

Summary: A standard systems-based approach to biomarker and
drug target discovery consists of placing putative biomarkers in the
context of a network of biological interactions, followed by different
‘guilt-by-association’ analyses. The latter is typically done based on
network structural features. Here, an alternative analysis approach
in which the networks are analyzed on a ‘semantic similarity’ space
is reported. Such information is extracted from ontology-based
functional annotations. We present Simii'ek, a Cytoscape plugin for
ontology-based similarity assessment in biological networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

A standard systems-based approach to biomarker and drug target
discovery consists of placing putative or known biomarkers in
the context of a network of biological interactions, followed
by different ‘guilt-by-association’ analyses (Merico et al., 2009).
Putative biomarkers may be derived, for example, from standard
differential expression analysis, including those from large-scale
gene expression and proteomics experiments. Networks may encode
gene—gene, gene—protein or protein—protein interactions. They are
typically inferred from published interactions or from computational
prediction models. Guilt-by-association approaches include graph
theoretic techniques, such as network clustering algorithms. Thus,
standard network-driven approaches tend to be based on the analysis
of biological network structures.

Here, we report an alternative analysis approach in which the
user-deﬁned networks are mapped onto a ‘semantic similarity’
space. In such a space, between-protein relationships are represented
by estimates of ontology-based functional similarity. Semantic
similarity is computed by using statistical information encoded in
functional databases annotated to the Gene Ontology (GO). We and
others have previously investigated semantic similarity assessment
in the context of functional genomics and network-based biology
(Azuaje et al., 2006; Pesquita et al., 2009).

2 THE SimTrek SYSTEM

We implemented a semantic similarity assessment system, SimTrek,
which can be integrated with different types of biological networks
under Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003). Figure 1a depicts the main
components and processes of SimTrek.

SimTrek allows the interrogation of networks based on user-
deﬁned queries and the retrieval of their k-nearest neighbors in the
network and semantic similarity spaces. The user-deﬁned inputs are:
the network to be analyzed and a list of gene/protein queries. The
network can represent different types of functional relationships,
e.g. regulatory or signaling interaction networks. The queries can
represent putative biomarkers or targets obtained from previous
experimental or computational analyses, such as differentially
expressed genes. The semantic similarity between gene products is
calculated using different information theoretic techniques (Pesquita
et al., 2009). Moreover, different numbers, k, of ‘semantically
similar’ neighbors can be retrieved for further analyses. Figure 1
shows a screenshot of SimTrek under Cytoscape.

Based on the assumption that the more information two terms
share in common, the more similar they are, three semantic similarity
measures (Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1995) are

implemented to measure between-term similarity within each of
the GO hierarchies. In addition, SimTrek offers two approaches to
assessing similarity between gene products based on the aggregation
of between-term similarities. The ﬁrst method is deﬁned as the
average inter-set similarity between the sets of GO terms associated
with two gene products. The second approach is the highest between-
term similarity approach, which selectively aggregates maximum
inter-set similarity values. A more detailed description of these
techniques can be found in the Supplementary Section.

Semantic similarity assessment results are displayed in different
panels (Figure 1). The ﬁrst includes two combo boxes which allow
users to select the target genes and k-values. The second is a
tabbed pane that shows the results from the GO hierarchies and the
topology-based neighborhood analysis methods. The corresponding
tables under the ﬁrst three tabs show the top k genes and their
similarity values. In the case where the number of gene pairs
having semantic similarity values is lesser than k, only those
gene pairs with values are displayed. The last table shows the
immediate network (graph-based) neighbors of the selected queries.
To minimize installation effort and overcome potential technical
constraints posed by ﬁrewalls, the current system provides compact
pre-computed ﬁles required to calculate semantic similarity. Regular
updates of these ﬁles may be obtained from our website.

3 APPLICATION EXAMPLE

Semantic similarity can provide information that cannot be extracted
from the input network topology alone. Unlike traditional graph-
based methods, S imTrek incorporates annotated knowledge that can
be exploited to discover systems-level, functional relationships.

Figure 1 illustrates the application of S imTrek using a network that
regulates the activity of p53 in humans (Abdi et al., 2008; Ma’ayan
et al., 2005;). After deﬁning a target query, e.g. GABl (Figure 1),
the system enables the user to implement different types of semantic
similarity estimation techniques. This can be done according to
species, GO hierarchy and evidence criteria. The retrieval of the
most semantically-similar (k-nearest neighbors) gene products can
be visualized and saved in a user-speciﬁed ﬁle. The user can either
interactively select queries on the network or provide lists of targets
previously stored in a text ﬁle. SimTrek also automatically detects
network topology-based nearest neighbors.

Different analyses of the k-most semantically similar
genes/proteins to the query sets can be implemented, for different
values of k. The retrieved neighbors can represent the inputs to
subsequent tasks for exploring the predictive potential of these
genes/proteins. For example, they can represent functionally
specialized clusters of genes (modules) or pathways connecting
phenotype-relevant processes or putative biomarkers. The example
shown in Figure 1 was obtained with k=3, Lin’s semantic
similarity, and concentrated on human GO annotations to the
Biological Process hierarchy, excluding those with IEA evidence
code. Note that the resulting set of semantic nearest-neighbors
(GRB2, ILK, GRB10) includes proteins that were not included in
the nearest neighborhood deﬁned by the input network topology
alone (SHP2, GRB2, PI3K). The ontology-based predictions are
consistent with results from other studies. For example, GABl,

a known cell death mediator, encodes a GRB2-associated-binding
protein (Holgado—Madruga et al., 1996). A direct functional
association between GRB10 and GABl through mitogenic
signaling has been reported (Deng et al., 2008). Currently, there
are no GO annotation terms from the Biological Process hierarchy
assigned to genes SHP2 and PI3K. Other results may suggest the
existence of novel protein—protein interactions or key functional
non-physical associations.

Unlike other tools, such as (standalone application) DynGO
(http://gauss.dbb.georgetown.edu/liblab/dyngo.html) and the R
package GOstats (http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.3/bioc/html/
GOstats.html), SimTrek was implemented as a Cytoscape plugin
(Shannon et al., 2003) to facilitate its integration within a widely
used software framework, which also offers powerful visualization
functionality. SimTrek also goes beyond the calculation of semantic
similarity to implement a network-centric analytical approach. It
can be used to detect potentially novel associations, which may
not be explicitly represented in the input network under analysis.
This allows users to move beyond the analysis of graph-derived
clusters of gene products. Functionally relevant associations across
the network or clusters are detected to aid in the interpretation
of network analysis or to guide the prediction of potential novel
targets or biomarkers. Furthermore, SimTrek contributes to the
incorporation of prior biological knowledge into network-based
analyses.

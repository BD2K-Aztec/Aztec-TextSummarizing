Abstract

Motivation: In vitro and in vivo selection of vaccines is time consuming, expensive and the se—
lected vaccines may not be able to provide protection against broad—spectrum viruses because of
emerging antigenically novel disease strains. A powerful computational model that incorporates
these protein/DNA or RNA level fluctuations can effectively predict antigenically variant strains,
and can minimize the amount of resources spent on exclusive serological testing of vaccines and
make wide spectrum vaccines possible for many diseases. However, in silico vaccine prediction re—
mains a grand challenge. To address the challenge, we investigate the use of linear and non—linear
regression models to predict the antigenic similarity in foot—and—mouth disease virus strains and in
influenza strains, where the structure and parameters of the non—linear model are optimized using
an evolutionary algorithm (EA). In addition, we examine two different scoring methods for weight—
ing the type of amino acid substitutions in the linear and non—linear models. We also test our mod—
els with some unseen data.

Results: We achieved the best prediction results on three datasets of SAT2 (Foot—and—Mouth dis—
ease), two datasets of serotype A (Foot—and—Mouth disease) and two datasets of influenza when the
scoring method based on biochemical properties of amino acids is employed in combination with
a non—linear regression model. Models based on substitutions in the antigenic areas performed
better than those that took the entire exposed viral capsid proteins. A majority of the non—linear re—
gression models optimized with the EA performed better than the linear and non—linear models
whose parameters are estimated using the least—squares method. In addition, for the best models,
optimized non—linear regression models consist of more terms than their linear counterparts,
implying a non—linear nature of influences of amino acid substitutions. Our models were also tested
on five recently generated FMDV datasets and the best model was able to achieve an 80% agree—
ment rate.

1 Introduction

 

Vaccines can be effective in preventing viral diseases and improving
the health of millions. However, there are many viral diseases for
which vaccine production/deployment is a challenge because of exten—
sive antigenic variability [Antigenic variability is the mechanism by
which infectious organisms (bacteria, virus or protozoa) alters its

surface protein to evade a host immune system (Daintith, 1990)].
Infection and/0r vaccination by an antigenically—variable virus do not
necessarily confer protection to subsequent exposure of the disease,
e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Inﬂuenza and Foot and
Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) (Moxon and Siegrist, 2011). Hence,
upon an outbreak of an antigenically variable virus, a rapid response

to reduce the spread of the virus is needed. In other words, the rapid
selection of the most effective vaccine, against the particular strain of
virus, is imperative. However, the in vitro serological tests that meas—
ure the cross reactivity of vaccines to outbreak—strains are time con—
suming and expensive. An in silico predictor that can accurately
predict vaccine efficacy would be invaluable.

With the advent of high—throughput sequencing, it is now pos—
sible to obtain the sequence of a virus within hours. The computa—
tional exploitation of this sequence information for vaccine design/
selection is therefore attractive. Yet to date, most computational re—
search on viral vaccines has focussed on developing tools for iden—
tifying epitopes (Brusic et (11., 1994; De Groot et (11., 2002; Meister
et (11., 1995; Schafer et (11., 1998). From our literature search, only
three previous studies attempting to predict antigenic variability and
therefore vaccine efficacy, for Foot and Mouth Disease and
Inﬂuenza were identified (Liao et (11., 2008; Reeve et (11., 2010,
2011). Foot and Mouth Disease and Inﬂuenza are both socioeco—
nomically important, highly infectious diseases caused by antigeni—
cally variable viruses. As DNA sequences and associated serological
test data are available for these viruses, they are obvious candidates
for the development of an in silico vaccine selection predictor.

Thus far, in silico approaches for predicting vaccine efficacy
have focussed on the use of linear and logistic regression techniques
[Reeve et al. (2010) used linear mixed effects models to relate esti—
mated antigenic differences to sequence variation in FMDV and
Liao et al. (2008) used stepwise and logistic regression to predict
antigenic variants in Inﬂuenza]. However, as vaccine efficacy relies
on the interaction of amino acid residues within or outside an anti—
genic site (loop) (Lesk, 2001) that may result in unusual (non—linear)
patterns in antigenic distance (Lee and Chen, 2004) it is likely that
non—linear models, that can handle complex interdependencies be—
tween variables, will be better suited. Furthermore, as biological
data can be noisy and/0r viral strains partially labelled (dataset con—
tains only sequence data but not serological data) (Bandyopadhyay,
2007; Li, 2010), a predictor that can be trained with imperfect data
is needed.

Here we present a genetic algorithm (GA) optimized quadratic
non—linear regression model that is able to accurately (98% accur—
acy) predict the vaccine efficacy for FMDV and Inﬂuenza A strains
taking amino acid sequences as input. We show that our model is an
improvement to the approaches previously taken. Furthermore, to
examine whether there are differences in the inﬂuence of amino acid
changes in different capsid proteins on the Virus Neutralization
(VN) titre/Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay value we com—
pare two approaches for calculating amino acid changes, one report—
ing the total number of changes across all capsid proteins (three
capsid proteins in FMDV and one in influenza), while the other re—
porting specific—capsid changes. Finally, we study two methods for
weighting the importance of amino acid changes, one based on the
characteristics and structure of amino acids and the other based on
amino acid substitution scores (PAM/BLOSUM).

2 Methods
2.1 Data

Three datasets comprising serological and amino acid sequence data
for outbreak—vaccine strain pairs for three different viruses were
used to train and cross—validate our models: (1) 22 FMDV SAT2
outbreak—vaccine strain pairs, taken from Reeve et al. (2010); (2) 52
outbreak—vaccine strain pairs for FMDV A, taken from Upadhyaya
et al. (2013) and (3) 54 outbreak—vaccine strain pairs for Inﬂuenza A
H3N2, taken from Liao et al. (2008).

Amino acid sequences for FMDV and Inﬂuenza A were either
downloaded from GenBank or provided by The Pirbright Institute.
The sequences of a particular viral serotype were harmonized to the
same length [669 residues for SAT2 comprising viral proteins (VP)
1—3, 655 residues for A similarly comprising (VP) 1—3 and 329 resi—
dues for HA1 gene of H3N2] by obtaining a multiple sequence
alignment using ClustalW (Thompson et (11., 2002). This alignment
was used to identify substitutions between the pairs of sequences for
which the serological data were available. We have used two differ—
ent approaches to build the models. In one we have used substitu—
tions only from specific antigenic regions, two regions in VP1 and
one in VP2 (Reeve et (11., 2010) for FMDV (SAT2 and A) and three
regions in H3N2 HA1 (Lee et (11., 2007). In the other setup, we have
used substitutions in all three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3)
for SAT2 and A, and the entire HA1 sequence for H3N2.

2.2 Scoring methods

3Sc0ring methods are used to determine the difference between a pair
of aligned amino acid sequences. Using our models we compared three
different scoring methods: (1) ‘No weighting’: the basic approach of
counting the number of substitutions between a pair of aligned se—
quences, as previously applied in studies on FMDV (Reeve et (11.,
2010). (2) ‘Grouping’: a weighting method applied in studies on
Inﬂuenza A (Liao et (11., 2008). The 20 amino acids are divided into
seven groups, namely, non—polar aliphatic, non—polar aromatic, polar,
positively charged and negatively charged and substitutions between
groups are assigned 1 while those within a group are assigned 0.

(3) ‘Matrix Scoring’: Use of the PAM—120 matrix, a matrix scor—
ing the probability with which one amino acid is substituted by an—
other in closely related species (Dayhoff, 1978). The matrix was
modified by setting the diagonal values to 0 so that identical amino
acids in the two sequences are not scored. The positive values were
changed to 0 and the negative values to positive so that frequently
occurring substitutions are not scored while the rare substitutions
are scored. In addition, all elements in the matrix were normalized
between 0 and 0.5. The scores using this approach were calculated
by totalling the values of all elements corresponding to substitutions
between pairs of sequences.

2.3 Linear and non—linear prediction

Linear and non—linear models were constructed to predict the anti—
genic variability. The scoring methods described above were used as
the continuous dependent variables for prediction using regression
techniques.

2.3.1 Linear regression model

Linear regression is the most widely used regression technique. It
aims to find the best line that fits the data. When the amino acid
changes in all capsid proteins are totalled, the linear model has only
one dependent variable x, and the predicted VN titre or HI assay
value (y) can be predicted as follows:

yZﬁO‘l'ﬁl-x- (1)

When changes are calculated for specific antigenic regions there are
three dependent variables (x1,x2,x3), and the linear regression
model for predicting the VN titre or HI assay value has the follow—
ing form:

3’ : ﬁo + [31361 + [32362 + [33363) (2)

where ﬁg, [31, [32 and [33 are the regression coefficients that need to
be estimated. The parameters are estimated by minimizing the mean

squared error (MSE) between the experimental and the predicted
values (Friedman et al., 2001), which is known as the least squares
method (LSM).

2.3.2 Non-linear regression models

In the linear regression model, it is assumed that the VN titre or HI
assay value depends linearly on the amino acid changes. However,
this may be overly simplistic and not adequate for describing the rela—
tionship between the VN titre or HI assay value and the amino acid
changes. A non—linear regression model, however, can describe a more
complex relationship between the dependent (VN titre or HI assay
value) and the independent variables (amino acid changes). Here, we
adopted a quadratic (second—order polynomial) non—linear regression
model. Similar to that described for linear models, there is one de—
pendent variable if the amino acid changes in the capsid protein(s) are
totalled, and three variables if the amino acid changes are counted
specifically for each of the antigenic regions (capsid proteins). In the
former case, the quadratic model is in the following form:

y:ﬁo+/31x+ﬁ2x27 (3)
and in the latter case, the quadratic model has the following form:

3’ : ﬁo +ﬁ1x1+ ﬁzxz + ﬁsxs
+ﬁ4x1x2 + ﬁsxixs + ﬁexzxsi (4)
+ll7x% + ﬁgxﬁ + ﬁgxg

where [3,,i : 1 , 2, ..., 9 are the regression coefficients to be determined.
Typically, these parameters can also be estimated using the LSM.

In this study, we not only want to estimate the coefficients in the
quadratic regression model, but also to examine if any of the terms in
the non—linear model in Equation (4) can be removed to reduce the
complexity of the model. This is potentially beneficial due to the small
number of experimental data available for determining the coeffi—
cients. In the following, we describe in more detail a method for opti—
mizing the structure and coefficients of the quadratic regression model
using an evolutionary algorithm (EA), specifically a hybrid GA.

2.3.3 A hybrid GA

EAs were first developed in the early 19605 as models that simulate
biological evolutionary processes for parameter optimization (Back
et (11., 1997), among other purposes. GAs (Goldberg, 1989) and evo—
lution strategies (Schwefel, 1995) are two classes of widely used EAs
for optimization.

GAs were introduced in 1975 by Holland (1992). A canonical
GA uses binary (or Gray) coding for representing the decision
variables to be optimized. Starting from a randomly generated par—
ent population, in which each individual represents a candidate
solution, a canonical GA performs crossover and flip mutation to
generate new candidate solutions (offspring). The offspring individ—
uals are then evaluated to determine their ﬁtness, and in this study,
the prediction error of each candidate model. Then, offspring
individuals are selected according to their fitness value as parents for
the next generation. In this study, the better the fitness value (i.e. the
smaller the prediction error), the more likely an offspring individual
will be selected. The selection process simulates the principle of
survival of the fittest in natural evolution. This generations cycle
continues until a termination criteria is fulfilled, e.g. when the prede—
fined number of generations have been processed.

Many variants of the canonical GA have been developed by
introducing new representation schemes, genetic variations and se—
lection methods to enhance the search performance of the canonical

GAs (see e.g. Back etal., 1997). For example, in real—coded GAs
(RCGAs), decision variables can be directly represented using real—
values (Deb and Agrawal, 1995). Accordingly, new crossover and
mutation operators, e.g. simulated binary crossover (SBX) and new
mutation operators such as polynomial mutation have been designed
for RCGAs (Deb and Agrawal, 1995).

SBX operation was proposed by Deb and Agrawal (1995). Given

0 and 1 is generated at first:

 

1
(2mm + 1 if “.305
ﬁqi : 1 (5)
 '15 + 1 otherwise,

where 115 is a distribution index. As recommended in Deb and
Agrawal (1995), 115 is typically set to 20. Two offspring solutions,

x511“) and xE-Z’Hl), are then produced as follows:
W : o.s[(1+ aw + (1 — aw), (a)
xlzﬂl) : 0-5 [(1 — ﬁqi)xz('17t) + (1 + ﬁqi)xz('27t)]7 (7)
In polynomial mutations, a probability distribution is first defined:

where 11m is the distribution factor, and [3,",- is given by

1
(zuiwm + 1 — 1
1
1 — (2(1 — n,))’7m + 1 otherwise

 

ifn,£0.5
ﬁmi : ‘

 

If a mutation in the individual occurs, the parameter value is given as
xl:x+(“_5)ﬁmi7 (10)

where or and 5 are the upper and lower bounds for the mutation val—
ues, respectively. 11m is also set to 20 in this study. Additional details
of both the SBX and polynomial mutation operations can be found
in Deb and Agrawal, (1995).

We use a hybrid GA to optimize both the structure as well as the
parameters of quadratic regression model in Equation (4). By struc—
ture, we mean here which of the 10 terms in the non—linear model
should be kept for prediction. We aim to find a quadratic model of
minimum complexity that best predicts the SAT2, A and H3N2
data. Meanwhile, we intend to optimize the coefficients of the exist—
ing terms in the non—linear regression model. In the following, we
elaborate the details of the hybrid GA used for optimizing the non—
linear regression model.

Representation: A binary chromosome and a real—valued
chromosome are used to represent the structure and coefficients of
the non—linear regression model, respectively. The binary chromo—
some has 10 bits of a value ‘0’ or ‘1’, where a ‘1’ means that the cor—
responding term of the model in Equation (4) is kept in the model
and a ‘0’ indicates that the corresponding term is deleted. The real—
valued chromosome directly encodes the coefficients. For example,
the following individual

 

1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1

 

0.1 1.2 —1.5 0.5 2.2 0.3 —0.8 0.1 1.8 3.2

defines the following non—linear regression model:
31: 0.1+2.2x1x2 —0.8x2x3 +3.2x§. (11)

Population: In this study, the population size is set to 100, with
each individual representing a candidate non—linear regression model
specified by two chromosomes. The initial parent population is gen—
erated randomly, the value of the binary chromosome is set to ‘0’ or
‘1’ with a probability of 0.5, respectively, whereas the value of the
real—valued chromosome is set to a uniformly distributed random
number between [—0.1, 0.1].

Fitness function: The fitness of the individuals is determined by
calculating the MSE between the predicted and the experimental
VN titre or HI assay values:

1 N
MSE :32)» 42’)? (12>
i:1

where y,- and y? are the VN titre or HI assay value predicted by the
model and the experimental value of the ith training data pair, re—
spectively, i : 1, 2, ..., N, N is the number of training samples.

The selection strategy adopted in this study is an elitism strategy.
Before selection, the offspring population is combined with the par—
ent population, forming a population of 200 individuals. Then, the
best 100 individuals are selected as the parents for the next
generation.

Reproduction: The binary tournament selection is adopted to se—
lect individuals from the parent population to generate offspring,
one at a time. At each time, two individuals in the parent population
are randomly selected and the fitter is chosen as a parent. This is re—
peated to choose a second parent individual.

Crossover and mutation are then applied to the two parents to
generate two offspring individuals. As each individual has two dif—
ferent types of chromosomes, different crossover and mutation oper—
ators are applied to the binary and real—valued chromosomes. For
the binary chromosome, uniform crossover and ﬂip mutations are
employed. For the real—valued chromosome, SBX and polynomial
mutation are used. The probability for crossover and mutation are
specified to be 0.9 and 1, respectively. This process repeats until 100
offspring are generated.

Selection: Parent populations are combined with the offspring
population before selection. The 200 individuals are sorted based
first on the individuals’ front number in a decreasing order and then
on the crowding distance in an ascending order. Finally, the first
100 individuals are selected as the parents of the next generation. In
this study, 500 generations are run before the evolutionary opti—
mization is terminated.

2.4 Model performance comparison

The specificity, sensitivity and agreement rates for pairs of predicted
and true VN titre or HI assay values were calculated for all models.
For FMDV serotype SAT1 and A r1 values between 0.3 and 1.0 are
indicative of reasonable levels of cross protection, whilst values
below 0.3 indicate the need to acquire or develop a new/different
vaccine strain (Barnett et al., 2001). Specificity is the ratio of the
predicted similar viruses (predicted VN titre or HI assay value >0.3)
to the true similar viruses (actual VN titre or HI assay value >0.3)
as a percentage. Sensitivity is the ratio of predicted variants (pre—
dicted VN titre or HI assay value <0.3) to true variants (actual VN
titre or HI assay value <0.3) represented as a percentage. The agree—
ment rate is the ratio of all truly predicted pairs to the number of all
virus pairs. In addition to the above performance parameters, the
MSEs were also compared for all models.

3 Results and discussions

Figure 1 provides an overview of our approach. Here we assume
that the efficacy (cross—reactivity) of a vaccine is accurately meas—
ured by a serological test (HI for Inﬂuenza or VN for Foot and
Mouth disease) and that this can be predicted from the alignment of
amino acid sequences for the heterologous virus (e.g. outbreak
strain) and homologous virus (e.g. the vaccine strain) pair. Thus, to
create our training and validation datasets we use serological test re—
sults (r1/HI assay values) and the sequence data from the alignment
files. The serological data results are directly used as the dependent
variables for regression analysis while the sequence data from pair—
wise comparisons are used with three types of scoring methods (refer
to Table 1 for details), outputs of which are used as the independent
variables for regression analysis.

In the following, we compare the prediction performance of the
linear and non—linear regression models, where in one case the
amino acid changes on the capsid protein(s) are totalled (herein
referred to as ‘no loops’), and in the other case, the changes in the
three antigenic regions are counted separately (referred to as
‘loops’). The agreement rates for the two FMDV serotypes SAT2, A
and inﬂuenza A are shown in Table 2. The MSEs for the same data—
sets are presented in Figures 2—4, respectively. From the figures, we
can see that better prediction results can be achieved when the
amino acid changes in different capsid proteins are treated as differ—
ent independent variables. The agreement rates for models with
immunodominant positions (a total of 39) or ‘loops’ were at least
similar or better than those containing amino acid positions for the
capsid protein(s). In addition, the MSEs for the models with anti—
genic loops are lower than those without loops except the ‘scoring
model’, whose MSEs are almost the same, refer to Figures 2—4. It is
noteworthy that the non—linear grouped model optimized using the
GA obtained the best performance. The results from the three data—
sets for FMDV SAT 2, two datasets for FMDV A and two datasets
for inﬂuenza are consistent across serotypes. SAT2 results presented
here are for SAT2 sequence RWA/2/01, A sequence TUR02 and in—
ﬂuenza Phyllipines/OZ/ 82/ 01.

Even though the capsid protein(s) are directly involved in deter—
mining the antigenicity of the virus, from the modelling point of
view, it is only the specific antigenic areas (loops) that are most rele—
vant. However, when the changes in capsid(s) are summarized, use—
ful information for prediction purposes may be lost, resulting in
poor prediction performance. Indeed, certain positions within the
capsid proteins, not included in the antigenic loops, may be essential
for improving the prediction quality. Thus, a way to weigh each pos—
ition to extract the most significant ones will greatly improve the
model based on antigenically relevant residues.

When we compare scoring methods, the grouping method per—
forms the best out of the three. The grouping method had agreement
rates between 73 and 100% while the matrix scoring method between
26 and 85%. For the non—weighted approach, it was between 62 and
90% across all datasets. The lower rates correspond to models
involving residues in the capsid protein(s). Table 2 shows the perform—
ance of the weighted and the non—weighted linear and non—linear
models.

The grouping method that classifies amino acids based on their
biochemical properties distinguishes between amino acid substitu—
tions based on their relevance to the overall protein structure and
thus would be expected to enhance the regression models. The 20
amino acids have different properties and not all substitutions are
equally important for measuring antigenic variability. It is also
known that certain amino acid substitutions are more common than
others (Betts and Russell, 2003).

weak due to the limited amount of data available for the analysis.
This is contrary to the expectation that the number of amino acid
substitutions must be negatively correlated to antigenic similarity.
However, for some less frequently occurring substitutions the correl—
ation was seen to be weakly negative. This is explained by the fact
that, in nature, substitutions of one amino acid with another of simi—
lar properties is permissible, with the overall structure/function of
the protein remaining unchanged (Chasman and Adams, 2001). The
grouping method exploits this phenomenon by scoring substitutions
with similar biochemical properties as 0 and substitutions that may

regardless of structural relevance includes frequent substitutions
that are of little significance to the model; the overall result of this is
a poor quality model.

Comparing the performance of the non—linear regression model
with LSM and the one optimized with GA, we found from Figures
2—4 and Table 2 that the GA model perform clearly better in 12 out
of 18 cases, while the GA model is worse than the LSM model only
in three cases. In addition, it is noted that the agreement rates on the
FMDV A dataset are slightly worse than those of the other two data—
sets. This might be attributed to the fact that the spread of the r1 val—
ues in the FMDV SAT2 and INFLUENZA datasets is better than
that in the FMDV A dataset.

However, the performance of the non—linear models was consist—
ently better than the linear models across all virus datasets, scoring
methods and antigenic regions (i.e. loops/non—loops). Equations (13)
and (14) detail the two best performing quadratic models; a grouped
with loops and a non—weighted with loops model, respectively, for
SAT2.

These regression models have a much larger number of terms than
their linear counterparts. In other words, the non—linear models have a
much higher complexity than that of the linear models. In cases where
the GA—optimized non—linear regression models have performed worse
than the linear models, the non—linear models are found to be much
simpler (fewer number of coefficients), refer to Table 2. We also calcu—
lated the 95% confidence interval for all model coefficients to find out
the statistically significant ones which supports the above and are also
reported in Table 2. This implies that the relationship between the

variables may be highly non—linear and there is a complex additive ef—
fect of two or more types of amino acid substitutions, which can be
better explained by quadratic terms.

We carried out a null hypothesis test to see whether our best
model (non—linear regression with GA using the grouped looped
scoring method) performed better than the linear, non—linear regres—
sion with LS and cubic models using the same scoring methods. For
the linear model, the r2 (coefficient of determination of the regres—
sion line) was 0.186 and P value (probability of obtaining the
observed sample results when the null hypothesis is actually true)
was 0.10. For the non—linear model with LS r2 was 0.326 and P was
0.05; for the cubic model r2 was 0.467; P was 0.02. However, for
our non—linear model with GA r2 was 0.787; P was 0.0002. The
above results show that even though there are improvements in both
r2 and P values from one to the next higher degree model, our
method using a quadratic model with GA performs better than a
cubic model. Thus, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis that
our non—linear regression with GA does not perform better than the
linear and the cubic models.

We also used five additional pairwise comparisons of FMDV A
sequences (provided by The Pirbright Institute) to test our best
model (grouping method with non—linear regression using GA). The
model was able to achieve an 80% agreement rate with the actual
serological data. Both the non—linear using LS and the linear models
achieved 60% agreement rate on the actual data. It was generally
seen that the sequences for which the test results did not match the
actual serological data, the input variables for testing were outside
the range of the data that was used for training the models.
Consequently, we think that the availability of more data for train—
ing would have helped us achieve better agreement rates to the ac—
tual data. Table 1 gives a summary of the results. These results are
highly encouraging, considering that only very limited amount data
was available for training the models. Our results clearly indicate
that nature—inspired optimization techniques are competitive for
solving challenging biological problems.

Although our test results indicate that a cubic regression model may
not necessarily better than the quadratic model, it is still of interest to in—
vestigate whether more general models, which can be created using
symbolic regression with the help of genetic programming (Schmidt and
Lipson, 2009), in particular if there is more data available.

4 Conclusions

This study compared three types of regression models, namely, linear,
quadratic with parameter optimization using LSM and quadratic with
both the structure and parameters being optimized with a hybrid GA.
All of these models were further compared based on the presence]
absence of specific antigenic loops for FMDV and inﬂuenza. The looped
models performed ~20% better than the unlooped models. Better pre—
diction results are achieved when amino acid changes in the capsid(s)
were treated as different independent variables. Models with substitu—
tions in the antigenic areas performed better than ones that took the en—
tire exposed viral capsid protein(s) i.e. only the specific antigenic regions
on the capsid protein(s) are most relevant for modelling. When substitu—
tions in the capsid(s) are summarized, important information for predic—
tion may be overlooked resulting in poor results. MSEs for looped
models are lower than their unlooped counterparts except the scoring
model for which the MSEs are almost the same. Comparing the
weighted and the non—weighted methods, the grouping method per—
formed best among the three, which is probably because the grouping
method classifies amino acids based on their biochemical properties
that enhance the models. The non—weighted approach did not perform
as well as the grouping method perhaps because it considers all substitu—
tions regardless of structural relevance, thereby including frequent sub—
stitutions of little significance to the model. The prediction power of the
scoring method was unexpectedly low which is probably because a
significant amount of biological data was lost when the substitution
matrix was normalized to penalize only the non—frequent substitutions.
Overall, the models that combined the scoring method based on
biochemical properties of amino acids with non—linear regression for the
specific antigenic areas on the capsid protein(s) gave best results.

We used a GA to optimize the structure and parameters to fit the
non—linear model. GA is a much more robust optimization method
than LSM as LSM cannot find the optimal solution of coefficients if
the initially guessed solution is not sufficiently close to the ideal so—
lution. Hence, GAs are able to work well with noisy biological data,
which is reﬂected in our results as the non—linear regression models
using the GA performed consistently better (throughout datasets)
than the linear and the non—linear models whose parameters are esti—
mated using the LSM.

The predictive ability of any model heavily depends on the data
used to build them. Thus, the quality and availability of data has a pro—
found effect on the efficiency and the predictive ability of the method.
Consequently, due to lack of serological data, the results reported in
this article are still preliminary. Nevertheless, considering that we have
achieved similar results across six datasets for two different viruses
(FMDV and Inﬂuenza), it would not be unreasonably optimistic to say
that similar models can perhaps be deployed for other viruses when
working towards developing an in silico vaccine predictor.

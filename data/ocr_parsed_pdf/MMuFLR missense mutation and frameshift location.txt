include minimum base quality, minimum coverage depth and
minimum frequency of a speciﬁc allele.

2.4 Eliminate common variants

The resulting VCF ﬁle will likely contain many commonly
known variants, which would not be useful in determining can—
didate targets. MMuFLR uses the ‘annotate’ command of
SnpSift (Cingolani et al., 2012) to merge variants from the sam—
ples being evaluated with known variants from the dbSNP data—
base (Sherry et al., 2001), as well as a user—provided list. Then the
‘filter’ command of SnpSift is used to eliminate those annotated
variant entries.

2.5 Determine variant effects

MMuFLR next categorizes the effect of each variant using
Sanff (Cingolani et al., 2012). The ‘ﬁlter’ command of
SnpSift is used to separate the missense and frameshift variants
into individual ﬁles for reporting.

2.6 Report variants

Finally, a new Galaxy tool, ‘Sanff Ensembl CDS’, inserts the
variants into transcripts retrieved from Ensembl (Flicek et al.,
2013) and reports the amino acid sequence of the abnormal pep—
tides. Included in the report are the sequencing depth of reads at
the mutation site and the prevalence of the mutation. A param—
eter can be set to ignore poly—A/T sequences of speciﬁed lengths.

3 RESULTS

MMuFLR was executed for two human meningioma RNA—seq
datasets, MG1 and MG2. MMuFLR settings restricted the selec—
tion of candidate genes with minimum coverage of ﬁve reads, with
a prevalence >0.32 and a Phred quality score of 20 or more.
MMuFLR also ignored poly A/T mononucleotide sequences of
35. MMuFLR identiﬁed 16 frameshifts and 576 missense muta—
tions in the MG1 sample, and 10 frameshifts and 509 missense
mutations in the MG2 sample. The candidates were evaluated for
their presence in other samples. Sanger sequencing of nine prom—
inent candidates, not found in other cancer samples, veriﬁed the
existence of the mutations within the tumor samples, with the
MMuFLR prevalence accurately reﬂecting the relative abundance
of the mutation within the total transcripts present (Table 1).
Because there were no normal samples available for comparison,
these mutations may represent rare germline variants.

4 CONCLUSIONS

One challenge for developing patient—speciﬁc cancer vaccines is
identifying novel peptides speciﬁc to the tumor cells. MMuFLR
is an innovative Galaxy—based software tool designed to locate
highly abundant transcripts with frameshift or missense muta—
tions within protein—coding sequences. MMuFLR ignores poten—
tially false candidates such as frameshifts located within poly
A/T sequences of mononucleotides, which is believed to result
from a loss of fidelity during replication due to dissociation
within the reverse transcriptase binding site in a phenomenon
referred to as ‘stuttering’. Because there is always a lag between

the identiﬁcation of SNPs and their incorporation into the
dbSNP database, MMuFLR provides the ability to establish a
supplementary SNP table in which the researcher can record and
thereby ignore SNPs identified during their research efforts.
MMuFLR has been successfully tested with both human and
mouse samples, but should be easily adaptable to other
organisms.

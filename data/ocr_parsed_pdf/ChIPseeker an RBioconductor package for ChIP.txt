Abstract

Summary: ChlPseeker is an R package for annotating ChlP—seq data analysis. It supports annotat—
ing ChlP peaks and provides functions to visualize ChlP peaks coverage over chromosomes and
profiles of peaks binding to TSS regions. Comparison of ChlP peak profiles and annotation are also
supported. Moreover, it supports evaluating significant overlap among ChlP—seq datasets.
Currently, ChlPseeker contains 15 000 bed file information from GEO database. These datasets can
be downloaded and compare with user’s own data to explore significant overlap datasets for infer—
ring co—regulation ortranscription factor complex for further investigation.

Availability and implementation: ChlPseeker is released under Artistic—2.0 License. The source
code and documents are freely available through Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/pack
ages/release/bioc/htmI/ChlPseeker.html).

1 Introduction

Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput
sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become standard technology to investi-
gate genome wide binding sites of transcription factors (TFs).
To analyze these DNA binding sites to determine their potential
regulatory functions, proximal genes/transcripts and regulatory
elements are considered to annotate these loci. Several applications
were developed for annotating ChIP-seq data. (IhIPpeakAnno (Zhu
et (11., 2010) is an R package that designed for ChIP-seq and ChlP-
chip data annotation. Because (IhIPpeakAnno does not consider
strand information, it misclassifies peaks with wrong orientation
(see Supplemental File). Other tools including PAVIS (Huang et (11.,
2013) and PeakAnalyzer (Salmon—Divon et (11., 2010), they all have
similar functions of annotating peaks by nearest genes and proximal
genomic features. Existing tools are all designed for single dataset.
ChIP-seq is rapidly becoming a common technique and there are a
large number of datasets available in the public domain. Results

from individual experiments provide a limited understanding of
chromatin interactions, as there is many factors cooperate to regu-
late transcription. Existing software lack of functionalities for com-
paring profiles of ChIP-seq datasets in different levels, including
profiles of peaks binding to TSS regions, annotation and enriched
functional profiles.

There are increasing evidences shown that combinations of TFs
are important for regulating gene expression (Perez—Pinera et 31.,
2013; Zhu et 31., 2008). However, systematically identification of
TF interactions by ChIP-seq is still not available. Even if a specific
TF binding is essential for a particular regulation was known, we do
not have prior knowledge of all its co-factors. There are no system-
atic strategies available to identified un-known co-factors by ChlP-
seq. To fill this gap, we present an R/Bioconductor package,
ChlPseeker, for ChIP peak annotation, comparison and visualiza-
tion. It incorporates statistical testing of co-occurrence of difference
ChIP-seq datasets and can be used to identify co-factors by explor-
ing publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.

2 Functions

ChlPseeker implements annotatePeak function for annotating peaks
with nearest gene and genomic region where the peak is located.
Almost all annotation software calculates the distance of a peak to
the nearest TSS and annotates the peak to that gene. This can be
misleading as binding sites might be located between two start sites
of different genes or hit different genes, which have the same TSS lo—
cation in the genome. The anntatePeak function provides param—
eters to annotate genes with a max distance cutoff and all genes
within this distance will be reported for each peak. For annotating
genomic region, annotatePeak function reports detail information
when genomic region is Exon or Intron. For instance, ‘Exon
(uc002sbe.3/9736, exon 69 of 80)”, means that the peak is overlaps
with the 69th exon of the 80 exons that transcript uc002sbe.3 pos—
sess and the corresponding Entrez gene ID is 9736. ChlPseeker pro—
vides plotAnnoBar, plotAnnoPie, vennpie and plotDistToTSS
functions to visualize ChIP peak annotation. plotAnnoBar and
plotDistToTSS functions support comparing among different ChIP—
seq data. ChIPseeker supports annotating ChIP—seq data of a wide
variety of species if they have transcript annotation TxDb object
available. Users can generate a TxDb object from UCSC Genome
Browser, BioMart database or GFF/GTF3 file by makeTmnscript
DbFromUCSC, maleeTmnscriptDbFromBiomart and makeTmn
scriptDbFromGFF functions respectively. These functions are avail—
able via the GenomicFeatures package (Lawrence et al., 2013).

For functional enrichment analysis, ChlPseeker works fine with
in house developed Bioconductor package, clusterProfiler (Yu et al.,
2012), DOSE (Yu et al., 2015) and ReactomePA. Once the peaks
are annotated, users can use these packages to identify predominant
biological themes through Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes, Disease Ontology and Reactome Pathway.
Functional profile comparison is also supported by clusterProfiler.

ChlPseeker provides cot/plot to visualize the peak locations and
intensities over the whole genome. The plotAUgPron function visu—
alizes the average profile of ChIP peaks binding to TSS region, while
peakHeatmap function generate a heatmap of ChIP peaks binding
to TSS regions. These two functions can accept a list of bed files and
plot profiles and heatmaps among several ChIP experiments, making
it easy to compare among different ChIP experiments based on the
profiles of peaks binding to TSS regions.

For comparing overlap of peaks and annotated genes,
ChlPseeker provides vennplot to calculate the overlap and visualize
the result. This method is widely used to compare different ChIP
experiments and to infer cooperative in regulation. However simple
overlap calculation is insufficient. In ChlPseeker, we provide
enrichPeakOL/erlap function to perform statistically rigorous
comparisons of ChIP—seq datasets. ChlPseeker provides shuffle func—
tion to randomly permute the genomic locations of ChIP peaks. The
enrichment analysis of peak overlap is based on permutation test. A
thousand (nShuffle : 1000, by default) of random ChIP data were
generated to estimate the background null distribution of the over—
lap. The P—value is then calculated by the probability of observing
more extreme overlap. Multiple comparison corrections including
Bonferroni, Benjamini and False Discovery Rate (FDR) are also
incorporated. With the enrichPeakOL/erlap function, we can esti—
mate how well two replicated experiments are and also compare
overlap of two ChIP datasets from experiments of two binding pro—
teins. If the overlap is significant, then these two proteins may c0—
operate in regulations.

To make this co—factor inference available to the community, we
incorporated the ChIP seq data deposited in GEO database. With

these datasets, we can compare our own dataset to those deposited
in GEO to identified co—occurrence binding proteins that maybe
cooperated with the one we are interested in. Hypothesis can be gen—
erated by this inference and serve as a starting point for further in—
vestigations. Within the ChlPseeker package, we have collected
information of about 15 000 bed files deposited in GEO database,
which covers 68 species. User can access detail information by
getGEOInfo function for specify genome version. ChlPseeker pro—
vides downloadGEObedFiles function to download all the bed files
of a particular genome. Users can also use downloadGSMbedFiles
to download all bed files with a specific GSM accession number list.
After downloading the bed files, users can pass the folder to
enrichPeakOL/erlap function, which will parse the folder and com—
pare all the bed files. It is also possible to test the overlap signifi—
cance among bed files that are mapping to different genome versions
and even bed files from different species if chain file is passed to
enrichPeakOL/erlap.

3 Results

ChlPseeker is developed as an R package within the Bioconductor
(Gentleman et al., 2004) project and is released under Artistic—2.0
License. ChlPseeker integrates ChIP annotation, comparison and
visualization and serves as a toolbox for analysis of ChIP—seq data.
It can visualize genomic coverage of ChIP—seq data, annotate gen—
omic features of ChIP peaks and their nearest genes. ChlPseeker sup—
ports visualize intensities of ChIP peaks binding to TSS sites and
comparison based on these profiles. It supports statistical test for
overlap among ChIP—seq datasets. More importantly, it removes a
major obstacle for scientists to query and utilize ChIP—seq data in
public domains.

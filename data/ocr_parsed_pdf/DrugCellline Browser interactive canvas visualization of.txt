ABSTRACT

Summary: Recently, several high profile studies collected cell viability
data from panels of cancer cell lines treated with many drugs applied
at different concentrations. Such drug sensitivity data for cancer cell
lines provide suggestive treatments for different types and subtypes of
cancer. Visualization of these datasets can reveal patterns that may
not be obvious by examining the data without such efforts. Here we
introduce Drug/CeII-Iine Browser (DCB), an online interactive HTML5
data visualization tool for interacting with three of the recently pub-
lished datasets of cancer cell lines/drug-viability studies. DCB uses
clustering and canvas visualization of the drugs and the cell lines, as
well as a bar graph that summarizes drug effectiveness for the tissue
of origin or the cancer subtypes for single or multiple drugs. DCB can
help in understanding drug response patterns and prioritizing drug/
cancer cell line interactions by tissue of origin or cancer subtype.
Availability and implementation: DCB is an open source Web-based
tool that is freely available at: http://wwwmaayan|ab.net/L|NCS/DCB

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patient-derived cancer cell lines have long been used as experi-
mental models for tumor biology in cancer research. These cell
lines preserve the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic
features of tumor cells and emulate tumor cells’ response to
stimuli. A drug that substantially inhibits the growth of a
cancer cell line would potentially suppress the progression
of its tumor of origin. Cell Viability assays measure the number
of live cells in response to treatment by drugs applied in different
concentrations. This type of assay is used to test the efﬁcacy of a
drug for inhibiting the growth or killing cancer cell lines.
A cancer cell line is considered sensitive to a drug if it has low
Viability when the drug is applied at low concentration. Screening
many cancer cell lines with many drugs applied in many concen-
trations can be used to match tumors with the most likely

effective drugs. These drugs could potentially be used to eventu-
ally treat individual patients (Duan et al., 2013).

Aberrant tumor growth through rapid cell proliferation could
be attributed to malfunction of many pathways (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). The regulatory networks that regulate cell pro-
liferation and tumor growth in cancer are wired differently from
cell line to cell line, and such intricacies imply that different
drugs, targeting different pathways, would have different effects
on different cell lines. Yet, until recently, efforts to screen drugs
against cell lines in high throughput were impeded by the amount
of cell Viability assays that could be performed in a reasonable
time. In recent years, however, the technology for high-through-
put cell Viability assays has been developed, and several datasets
consisting of tens of thousands cell Viability experiments have
been published (Barretina et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013).
These datasets include cell Viability assays of dozens of drugs
applied to hundreds of cell lines. Analysis and Visualization of
such data can potentially uncover informative patterns that
would have direct therapeutic potential. Here, we present
Drug/Cell-line Browser (DCB), a HTML5 Web-based applica-
tion that uses canvas clustering (Tan et al., 2013) to Visualize
three recent cell Viability assay datasets: from the Cancer Cell
Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project (Barretina et al., 2012), from
the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity (GDS) in cancer project Wang
et al., 2013) and from an anticancer compound study for breast
cancer (Heiser et al., 2012).

2 METHODS

Cancer cell line canvas: Each tile on the canvas represents a cancer cell
line. The tiles are colored by tissue of origin or by cluster ﬁtness using
basal gene expression vector, mutation status or overall drug response.
To construct the canvases, adjacency matrices were created where cell
lines are connected if they share the tissue of origin or cancer subtype,
display similar basal expression proﬁle, mutation status proﬁle or
respond similarly to the vector of drugs. These matrices are fed into
the Network2Canvas Python script (Tan et al., 2013) to generate the
coordinates of the tiles in each cancer cell line canvas. Such information
is stored in a JavaScript Object Notation (J SON) format. DCB visualizes
each cancer cell line canvas as an Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) rect
element using the D3 JavaScript library (Bostock et al., 2011). The edges
of the canvas fold on themselves forming a torus. Drug canvas: Each tile
on the drug canvas represents a drug. Each tile is colored by its ﬁtness
based on similarity with its eight surrounding neighboring drugs. Fitness
is deﬁned as the similarity of a drug’s sensitivity proﬁle vector, chemical

structure similarity, drug targets and changes in expression in cell lines
after treatment with the drug. Details for computing cell line/cell line
similarity are provided in the Supplementary File.

The drug similarity adjacency matrices were created from distance
tables that measure similarity between drugs.

Then, similarly to the way the cancer cell line canvas was processed,
the matrix is fed into the Network2Canvas Python script, and the DCB
application visualizes the drugs J SON canvases with SVG elements using
D3. The drug canvas is also continuous where the edges fold on them-
selves forming a torus. To ﬁll all the tiles on the canvas, some drugs
appear twice. Tissue panel: The tissue panel shows the tissue of origin
in lexicographical order. Cancer cell lines are grouped by tissue of origin
in a J avaScript object so that tissues of origin and cancer cell lines map to
each other. Tissues are then sorted in lexicographical order and visualized
as SVG rect elements on the panel. An event listener function listens to
click events on the drug canvas to adjust each tissue rect. Clicking on a
drug tile, the function computes the signiﬁcance of a tissue’s sensitivity to
that drug using Fisher’s exact test based on the number of highly sensitive
cancer cell lines for that tissue. The number of highly sensitive cell lines
per drug can be ﬁltered using a slider.

3 RESULTS

DCB comprises two canvases, one in the middle to Visualize
cancer cell lines and the other on the right to Visualize drugs
(Fig. 1). On the cancer cell line canvas, each tile represents a
cancer cell line, and the tiles are colored by tissue of origin or
by level of clustering where brighter colors mean high neighbor-
hood similarity. Cell lines are clustered by tissue type, basal gene
expression similarity, mutation status and response to drugs
vector. On the drug canvas, each title represents a drug and
the tiles are colored by how similar they are based on their sen-
sitivity profile, structure, shared targets and gene expression sig-
natures induced by the drugs. The tissue bar graph panel on the
right lists tissues in lexicographical order. The colors of tissues
match to the colors of cancer cell line tiles in the tissue View.
Mouse hovering on a cancer cell line tile displays its name and
highlights its tissue of origin on the tissue panel. Mouse hovering

the cancer cell line canvas enables zooming in and out, and
dragging the canvases allows panning. Tiles on the cancer cell
line canvas can be labeled by the Label Cell Lines selection on the
left. Users may need to zoom in to read the cell line name labels.
Users can focus on a speciﬁc tissue using the Filter by Cell Type
selection. If a tissue is selected, the cancer cell line canvas will
show only cancer cell lines of the selected tissue. Clicking on a
cancer cell line on the canvas shows the top 25% most-associated
(sensitive) drugs on the drug canvas. A slider can be used to
adjust the percentage of drugs that are shown. Similarly, clicking
on a drug on the drug canvas shows the top 25% most-
associated (sensitive) cancer cell lines for the drug on the
cancer cell line canvas. A slider can be used to adjust the per-
centage of cell lines that are shown. Additionally, the tissue panel
shows the signiﬁcance of sensitivity of each tissue to that drug.
The black line on the panel delineates signiﬁcance threshold of
P<0.05. The signiﬁcance is calculated based on the number of
sensitive cancer cell lines for a particular tissue for a drug using
the Fisher’s exact test. Besides clicking on the drug canvas, drugs
can be chosen from a drop-down menu. DCB visualizes three
datasets: GDS, CCLE and Heiser et al. In the Heiser dataset, all
cell lines are derived from breast cancer and are colored by sub-
types instead of tissue of origin. Consequently, the tissue panel
shows subtypes instead of tissues. Overall, DCB can be used to
identify opportunities for cancer drug discovery and drug
repurposing.

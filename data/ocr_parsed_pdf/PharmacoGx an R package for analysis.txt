Abstract

Summary: Pharmacogenomics holds great promise for the development of biomarkers of drug re—
sponse and the design of new therapeutic options, which are key challenges in precision medicine.
However, such data are scattered and lack standards for efficient access and analysis, conse—
quently preventing the realization of the full potential of pharmacogenomics. To address these
issues, we implemented Pharmacon, an easy—to—use, open source package for integrative analysis
of multiple pharmacogenomic datasets. We demonstrate the utility of our package in comparing
large drug sensitivity datasets, such as the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and the Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia. Moreover, we show how to use our package to easily perform Connectivity
Map analysis. With increasing availability of drug—related data, our package will open new avenues
of research for meta—analysis of pharmacogenomic data.

Availability and implementation: Pharmacon is implemented in R and can be easily installed on
any system. The package is available from CRAN and its source code is available from GitHub.

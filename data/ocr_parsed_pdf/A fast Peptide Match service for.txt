ABSTRACT

Summary: We have developed a new web application for peptide
matching using Apache Lucene-based search engine. The Peptide
Match service is designed to quickly retrieve all occurrences of a
given query peptide from UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) with iso-
forms. The matched proteins are shown in summary tables with rich
annotations, including matched sequence region(s) and links to corres-
ponding proteins in a number of proteomic/peptide spectral databases.
The results are grouped by taxonomy and can be browsed by organism,
taxonomic group or taxonomy tree. The service supports queries where
isobaric leucine and isoleucine are treated equivalent, and an option for
searching UniRef100 representative sequences, as well as dynamic
queries to major proteomic databases. In addition to the web interface,
we also provide RESTful web services. The underlying data are updated
every 4 weeks in accordance with the UniProt releases.

1 INTRODUCTION

Locating occurrences of a specific peptide in a protein sequence
database is important for protein identiﬁcation in proteomics
studies as well as for sequence-based protein retrieval. The
Protein Information Resource (Wu et al., 2003) has hosted a
peptide match service for >10 years. It is one of the most popular
tools on the Protein Information Resource website.

Although exact peptide matching is algorithmically simple,
quickly locating a peptide in a large protein sequence database
has become challenging, as the number of protein sequences ex-
ponentially increases. So far, to our knowledge, no other peptide
match services provide all of the key characteristics in our new
service, including search speed, support for any query peptide of
23 amino acids long, coverage of all UniProtKB sequences
including isoforms (UniProt Consortium, 2013) and frequent
update. Other major peptide match methods are UniPept
(Mesuere et al., 2012), which indexes in silico digested tryptic
peptides, and Pep2Pro (Askenazi et al., 2010), which uses indexes
based on 6-mers. A detailed comparison of these and our method

is provided in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary
Table S1). Another related work is SANS (Koskinen and
Holm, 2012), which uses sufﬁx arrays to effectively identify pro-
tein sequence similarities in the range of 5&100% identity.

As brute-force peptide matching is slow, we need effective
ways to index protein sequences, analogous to indexing in rela-
tional databases. The recent advance in search engine technol-
ogy, such as the Apache LuceneTM (McCandless et al., 2010)
information retrieval software library, provides a scalable and
high-performance index structure as well as powerful and efﬁ-
cient search algorithms to build a fast search engine for our
Peptide Match service. Here we present our new peptide match-
ing application, with an enhanced web user interface.

2 METHODS

The source protein sequence database is UniProtKB (including isoform
sequences), currently containing >40 million protein sequences. The index
engine is built based on Apache Lucene. We index the original protein
sequences as well as leucine and isoleucine equivalent sequences. We in-
clude accession number, protein name, organism, taxonomic group and
lineage from UniProtKB records to annotate the matched proteins. We
also provide protein cross-references to proteomic/peptide spectral data-
bases if the matched proteins are present in those databases. We store the
corresponding UniProtKB accession numbers that are mapped to NIST
Peptide Libraries (Stein and Rudnick, 2009), PeptideAtlas (Desiere et al.,
2006), PRIDE (Vizcaino et al., 2013) and Immune Epitope Database
(IEDB) (Vita et al., 2009) using our ID mapping (Huang et al., 2011)
services. These informational fields are stored, and key ﬁelds are indexed
to support ﬁeld-speciﬁc search and fast retrieval.

The protein sequence is analysed by Lucene NGramTokenFilter,
which generates a series of 3-gram terms from the original sequence,
and therefore, allows searching for a tri-peptide. These 3-gram terms
ﬁlter search space analogous to other approaches: trypic peptides in
UniPept, 6-mers in Pep2Pro and suffixes in SANS. Internally, Lucene
index maintains an inverted table for a term and its corresponding protein
accession numbers, and stores the term frequency and position occur-
rence. The Lucene’s Term Query method can only ﬁnd the exact match
with the same length term from the indexes. For example, the Term
Query for 3-gram terms would match ‘MKE’ but not ‘MKEV’. We,
therefore, use Lucene’s Phrase Query to search for overlapping consecu-
tive 3-gram terms derived form the query peptide. We also use Lucene’s
Boolean Query to combine the Phrase Query of sequence ﬁeld and Term
Query of other informational ﬁelds if the peptide search is restricted by a
speciﬁc set of organisms, taxonomic groups or lineage.

To allow users to determine whether the given query peptide has pre-
viously been observed in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics

experiments, we provide a dynamic search of the query peptide against
four major proteomic/peptide spectral databases: gmeB (Craig et al.,
2004), NIST Peptide Libraries, PeptideAtlas and PRIDE from our web
application using the search engines of those individual databases. The
current implementation of Peptide Match service uses Apache Lucene 3.5
and Apache SoerM 3.5 for indexing and searching. The web application
is developed in Java Server Pages/Servlets running on Apache Tomcat 6.

3 RESULTS

The search engine is fast and accurate. A typical peptide match
from our web interface takes only a second, including time spent
rendering the results. On the search time itself, our test results
showed an average of 0.1 s from a random sample of ~11 million
peptides of 10—mers derived from the UniProtKB Human com-
plete proteome. For UniProtKB release 2013_07 containing ~40
million protein sequences with annotations (24 GB), the index
size is 98 GB and the indexing time is 5 h on a Linux server
with Intel® Xeon® 2.00 Ghz CPUs and 128 GB RAM.

The Peptide Match web interface provides multiple functional-
ities, both for input query and output navigation (Fig. 1). A user
can input a query peptide and specify whether to search the entire
UniProtKB or limit the search to sequences from one or more
selected organisms (Fig. 1A). For the latter, a user can either enter
an organism name/taxonomic ID of a UniProt complete prote-
ome or select a set of organisms from the UniProt reference prote-
omes. Additional options are provided to (i) restrict the matches in
UniRef100 (Suzek et al., 2007) representative sequences to reduce
redundancy and (ii) equate isobaric leucine and isoleucine to sup-
port MS-based proteomics. The match results are summarized by
organism and taxonomic group as pie charts and listed as tables.
The matched proteins are shown in paginated tables (Fig. 1B),
along with annotations, matched region(s) in the protein sequence
and hypertext links to corresponding databases. The match results
can be sorted by different ﬁelds and browsed by organisms, taxo-
nomic group or taxonomy tree (Fig. 1D). As an example (Fig. 1),
peptide ‘AAVEEGIVLGGGCALLR’ matches 65 proteins in
UniProtKB, among which 53 are from mammals, and 10, 5, 4
have links to corresponding proteins in PRIDE, NIST Peptide
Libraries and IEDB, respectively. For direct proteomic evidence
of the query peptide, the dynamic search using search engines of
the proteomic/peptide spectral databases further displayed the
peptide with links to the source MS data (Fig. 1C).

For a given peptide, the matching protein entries from
UniProtKB database can be directly accessed using a simple

URL (e. g. http://proteininformationresource.org/peptide/SVQY
DDVPEYK), and used for other servers as in PeptideAtlas. We
also provide a web interface for batch submission of peptides to
our service as well as RESTful web services. The underlying data
of our new Peptide Match server are updated every 4 weeks in
accordance with the UniProt releases. The Peptide Match services
will be forthcoming from the UniProt website (www.uniprot.org).

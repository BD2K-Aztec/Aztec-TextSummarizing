ABSTRACT

Motivation: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) resemble protein-
coding mRNAs but do not encode proteins. Most lncRNAs are
under lower sequence constraints than protein-coding genes and
lack conserved secondary structures, making it hard to predict them
computationally.

Results: We introduce an approach to predict spliced lncRNAs in
vertebrate genomes combining comparative genomics and machine
learning. It is based on detecting signatures of characteristic splice
site evolution in vertebrate whole genome alignments. First, we
predict individual splice sites, then assemble compatible sites
into exon candidates, and finally predict multi-exon transcripts.
Using a novel method to evaluate typical splice site substitution
patterns that explicitly takes the species phylogeny into account,
we show that individual splice sites can be accurately predicted.
Since our approach relies only on predicted splice sites, it can
uncover both coding and non-coding exons. We show that our
predicted exons and partial transcripts are mostly non-coding
and lack conserved secondary structures. These exons are of
particular interest, since existing computational approaches cannot
detect them. Transcriptome sequencing data indicate tissue-specific
expression patterns of predicted exons and there is evidence that
increasing sequencing depth and breadth will validate additional
predictions. We also found a significant enrichment of predicted
exons that form multi-exon transcript parts, and we experimentally
validate such a novel multi-exon gene. Overall, we obtain 336 novel
multi-exon transcript predictions from human intergenic regions.
Our results indicate the existence of novel human transcripts that
are conserved in evolution and our approach contributes to the
completion of the human transcript catalog.

1 INTRODUCTION

A series of high-throughput transcriptomics studies utilizing a
variety of different technologies revealed that mammalian genomes
are pervasively transcribed into a complex mosaic of transcripts
(Carninci et (11., 2005; ENCODE Project Consortium, 2007;
Kapranov et (11., 2007a, b). A large extent of these transcripts consists
of small and long non-protein-coding RNAs (nCRNAs). Due to
the diverse nature of these transcripts, our catalog of genes is still
incomplete.

Computational prediction of protein-coding genes is based on
Characteristic features of coding regions that distinguish them from
non-coding DNA (Burge and Karlin, 1997; Cruveiller et (11., 2003).
Coding genes exhibit a Clear evolutionary signature, since mutations
are often synonymous and preserve the reading frame. These signals
can be exploited to ﬁnd coding genes by comparative genomics
methods (Solovyev et (11., 2006; Stark et (11., 2007). Also machine
leaming-based approaches that recognize splice sites, transcriptional
and translational start and stop signals can successfully detect coding
genes (Gross et (11., 2007; Schweikert et (11., 2009; Stanke and Waack,
2003).

In contrast to protein-coding genes, nCRNAs form a
heterogeneous Class of transcripts that lacks common sequence
patterns, complicating their detection in genomic DNA. Some

nCRNA Classes, including common families like rRNAs, tRNAs
and miRNAs, preserve their Characteristic secondary structure
during evolution, guiding a computational prediction (Nawrocki
et (11., 2009; Washietl et (11., 2005). However, many other nCRNAs
exhibit neither conserved secondary structures nor sequence
conservation levels as high as coding exons (Fang et (11., 2006;
Ponjavic et (11., 2007), making it hard to ﬁnd them computationally.
Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) resemble protein-coding
mRNAs in that they are often capped, spliced and polyadenylated.
They can exhibit cell type-speciﬁc expression, are known to be
involved in transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, gene silencing,
imprinting and are known to play a major role in some human
diseases (Huarte and Rinn, 2010; Mercer et (11., 2009; Ponting
et (11., 2009; Wilusz et (11., 2009). Examples include XIST which
is involved in mammalian female X Chromosome inactivation and
dosage compensation (Senner and Brockdorff, 2009), MALATI
which affects the expression of genes controlling synapse formation
(Bernard et (11., 2010) and NRON which regulates nuclear trafﬁcking
by repressing the nuclear factor of activated T cells (Willingham
et (11., 2005).

We recently presented a computational approach to detect
lncRNAs with conserved intron positions in insect genomes (Hiller
et (11., 2009). This approach is solely based on a genomic screen for
regions that evolve like introns, exploiting that the intron boundaries
(splice sites) are well conserved and under purifying selection in
both coding and non-coding genes (Chodroff et (11., 2010; Ponjavic
et (11., 2007; Rodriguez-Trelles et (11., 2006). The approach crucially
relied on predicting introns as a single unit, which means pairs of
splice donor (5’) and acceptor (3’) sites are predicted in a single
step. This strategy works in insect genomes where introns are
very short [according to Lim and Burge (2001) most are <100 nt
in Drosophila melanogaster]. In contrast, vertebrate introns are
substantially longer and more variable in their length, preventing
the application of this intron-based method.

Here, we introduce a novel approach to de novo predict spliced
transcripts in intergenic regions of vertebrate genomes. Using a
combination of comparative genomics and machine learning, we
ﬁrst predict new splice donor and acceptor sites in whole genomes
and subsequently assemble them into exon predictions. Applying
this approach to an alignment of 4-4 vertebrate genomes, we predict
previously unreported coding and non-coding transcripts with
conserved exon/intron structures in the well-Characterized human
genome and validate these predictions with available transcript data
and own experiments.

2 METHODS

Input data: our analysis is based on the multiple alignment of 44 vertebrate
genomes with the human hg18 assembly as the reference downloaded from
the UCSC Genome Browser (Rhead et (11., 2010).

De novo splice site prediction: we trained support vector machines (SVMs)
to solve the binary classiﬁcation problem of de novo splice site prediction
comprising the following steps: (i) detect donor and acceptor splice site
candidates in multiple sequence alignments; (ii) train splice site SVMs with
features capturing patterns of splice site evolution; and (iii) use the SVM to
score candidate splice sites.

To this end, we screened the genome alignment of genic regions for
donor and acceptor candidates and divided them into real splice sites that
are annotated (>208 000 true positives) and false positives that are not
supported by available transcript data (~ 12.6 million). To perform supervised

machine learning, we compiled three disjoint sets: (i) positive and (ii)
negative samples to train and test individual donor and acceptor SVM models
and (iii) a set of intergenic candidate sites forming the search space for
putative novel splice sites. The positive set contained the splice sites of the
UCSC. Ref Seq and the Human mRNA gene tracks. Negative training data
were the remaining genic sites [unannotated sites within introns, exons or
untranslated regions (UTRs)]. We considered GT (donor) and AG (acceptor)
dinucleotides (both strands) which were conserved in at least ﬁve species.
Alignment blocks had to contain the intervals [—3 , 6] for donors and [— 19, 2]
for acceptors (Supplementary Fig. S3). To avoid obvious false positives,
sites with a MaxEntScan (Y eo and Burge, 2004) score < 0 were discarded
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We only considered canonical (GT/AG) splice
sites.

We generated ﬁve representative sample sets to efﬁciently train/test
donor-/acceptor SVMs [LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001), rbf-kernel, default
parameters]. Each training set consisted of 100000 randomly chosen sites
(50 000 positives and 50 000 negatives) and 10 000 independent instances to
test the resulting models (5000 positives and 5000 negatives). We evaluated
SVM performances by comparing receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), see Figure 1. Observed AUC values
were nearly identical among all sets, demonstrating that random sampling
did not bias our data. We kept the best performing 5’ and 3’ splice site models
and classiﬁed the broad set of intergenic candidates (~54 million) to identify
novel splice sites.

The splice site classiﬁcation was based upon the following eight features:
(1) human MaxEntScan splice site score; (241)10g-odds substitution scores
sues, sPair, smedian; (5) number of species in the alignment; (6) number of
species with conserved GT/AG dinucleotides and a positive MaxEntScan
score; (7) slope of a regression line ﬁtted to the PhastCons conservation
proﬁle of the splice site; and (8) average PhastCons score.

The MaxEntScan program (Yeo and Burge, 2004) scores splice site
sequences for similarity to typical splice sites. Overall, real splice sites
have higher scores than false positives (Supplementary Fig. S4). Next, we
computed log-odds scores to capture intrinsic sequence evolution of splice
sites (see also next paragraph). Splice sites are usually highly conserved at
the sequence level. Therefore, we included the total number of species per
alignment and the number of species with a conserved GT (for donors) and
AG (for acceptors) as SVM features. The average sequence conservation
signiﬁcantly decreases at the exoniintron boundary and increases at the
intronaexon boundary, see also Chodroff et a1. (2010). On average, the
splice sites are even more conserved than the adjacent exons (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). This holds for protein-coding as well as non-coding genes. The
slope of a linear regression line ﬁtted to the Phas tCons (Siepel et (11., 2005)
proﬁle of the region [—20, +20] for each splice site captures this information.
Supplementary Figure S5 shows the score distributions and discriminative
power of the individual features.

Log-odds substitution scores: we computed three variants of species-
and site-speciﬁc substitution scores (sues, spakand smedian) based on the
substitution frequencies in real and false splice sites. These log-odds capture
splice site evolution among species (Fig. 2) and the score is > 0 if the region
of interest conforms to real splice site evolution and <0 otherwise. The
more substitutions are consistent with splice site evolution, the higher is the
total score. We evaluated the donor region [—3,6] and the acceptor region
[—19,2] for all three score variants.

To compute score sues, we reconstructed ancestral sequences for each
splice site region using prequel (Siepel et (11., 2005). It computes marginal
probability distributions for bases at ancestral nodes in a phylogenetic tree.
For each edge e of the reconstructed binary tree and for each site i of each
two related sequences, we computed the frequency fi of substitutions of
nucleotide x, to nucleotide y, for each position in the splice site region
(x 75y and x,y e E, E = {A, C, G, T}). We tabulated the log-odds ratio of the
total number of pairwise substitutions observed between all positive and
negative training samples. Given a set of sequences, the sum of all log-
odds of all observed substitution events along each edge of the reconstructed

The log-odds substitution score spair was previously used in Hiller et al.
(2009). We counted substitution frequencies of each splice site position of
human against each other species, learned the log-odds ratio of positive and
negative samples and scored intergenic candidates with the sum of observed
log-odds.

Score smedian was inspired by the CSF metric for codon substitution
frequencies (Stark et al. , 2007). Similarly to sPair, we summed up log-odds for
each splice site position, but took the median instead of totaling the position-
speciﬁc scores. Since SVM training- and test sets have to be independent
(disjoint), log-odds substitution scores were always learned on training sets,
never on test sets.

Exon prediction: searching for short splice site signatures in the huge
intergenic space is expected to yield false positives, even at high classiﬁcation
conﬁdence values. However, exons as biologically meaningful units consist
of an acceptoridonor pair in close proximity. To ﬁnd parts of novel transcripts
(exons) and to reduce false positives, we derived candidate exons from
individually predicted splice sites by searching for acceptorAionor pairs on
the same DNA strand separated by not >300 nt. This is a natural cut-off
since 85% of all Re if Seq exons are <300 nt (and still 80% of all non-coding
exons).

To predict novel exons in intergenic regions, we evaluated all candidate
exons using a second SVM (exon-SVM) that was trained on characteristic
signatures of transcript-conﬁrmed exons.

Each internal exon of a multi-exon transcript is ﬂanked by an upstream
acceptor and a downstream donor. Conservation of such an exon implies
compatible acceptoridonor pairs present in many species. To capture the
conservation and the compatibility of the particular acceptoridonor pair, we
considered the absolute number and the fraction of species having both a
conserved acceptor and donor as two SVM features. Other features were
the previously assigned class probabilities of the splice site SVM and the
distance between particular splice site pairs. The exon-SVM was trained
with six features: (172) acceptor and donor SVM classiﬁcation probability;
(3) exon length; (4) number of species that have conservation for both splice
sites; (5) fraction of (4) and the number of species with conserved AG in
the acceptor alignment; (6) fraction of (4) and the number of species with
conserved GT in the donor alignment.

To train this exon-SVM, we obtained a set of real exons by requiring that
both splice sites are (i) not annotated as part of a pseudogene (according to the
Yale and the UCSC browser tracks); (ii) evolutionary conserved in the same
species (at least ﬁve); and (iii) conﬁrmed by Z 2 spliced expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) as well as 320% of all spliced ESTs present at the particular
locus. This was fulﬁlled for 334 (22% of 1521) EST-conﬁrmed exons. The
stringent ﬁltering assures that we exclude cases of transcriptional noise and
use only high-quality true positives during training. We randomly selected
284 of the 334 exons for training and used the remaining 50 to evaluate the
SVM. Then, 1000 EST-unconﬁrmed exons were randomly selected and 900
of these were used as negative training examples and the remaining 100 for
evaluation. We repeated this procedure 10 times, kept the best-performing
model with respect to sensitivity and speciﬁcity and classiﬁed the whole
exon candidate pool to detect exons that exhibit signatures speciﬁc to EST-
conﬁrmed loci.

Candidate gene structures: most coding genes and lncRNAs consist of
several exons and introns. If the predicted exons are real and belong to
multi-exon genes, we expect that they have a tendency to cluster spatially
within the genome. Human introns have a mean length of 6kb which we
used as a cut-off to deﬁne genomic clusters of predicted exons.

We performed a simulation test to determine whether predicted clusters
(deﬁned here as 32 exons separated by at most 6kb on the same strand)
occur more often than expected. To generate a background distribution,

we selected as many rejected exons (1750.5) as we observed positively
classiﬁed clustered exons (p>0.5) and counted the number of (random)
clusters. Repeating this sampling procedure 10000 times yields empirical
P-Values which indicate the statistical signiﬁcance of predicted exon clusters.
In case of overlapping exons, one representative according to the highest
SVM probability was selected to generate non-overlapping gene structures.

Coding versus non-coding exons: exons without protein homology (using
BLASTX against the NCBI nr database with -e 1e-5, -F F, -S 1) and no
protein-coding potential as predicted by RNAcode (Washietl et al., 2011) (-
b -r -s -p 0.01) were classiﬁed as ‘non-coding’. In addition, exons containing
stop codons in all three reading frames were classiﬁed as ‘non-coding’.

Secondary structures: we applied RNAz (Washietl et al., 2005) with default
parameters (window size 120 nt. step width 40 nt) to search for signatures of
conserved and stable RNA secondary structures in alignments of predicted
exons and alignments covering possible exonaexon junctions. For the latter,
we concatenated 60 nt up- and downstream of the predicted intron using
the Galaxy Browser (Goecks et al., 2010). These 120 nt regions mimic
alignments of the mature transcript and were scored by RNAz to identify
possible structures formed by long-range base pairs.

RNA-seq data: transcription of predicted exons was validated by RNA-seq
data from Wang et al. (2008). We basically relied to their mappings, but
re-mapped their short read data to conﬁrm additional exonaexon junctions.
For each predicted intron, we concatenated 26 nt of the predicted trailing
exons and built 52 nt long putative mature mRNA fragments. We performed
a BLASTN search of all 32 nt long reads against this database. Short reads
producing nearly perfect BLAST hits (Z30nt in length, 52 mismatches,
33 read coverage) spanning the 52 nt exoniexon junction support our
predicted splice junctions whenever they lack a better hit to other loci in the
genome. Apart from 37 exoniexon junctions that were directly veriﬁed by
the annotations of Wang et al. (2008), this procedure additionally conﬁrmed
nine previously unreported exoniexon junctions.

Experimental validation: to experimentally verify a prime multi-exon
transcript candidate, we designed primers to the predicted exonic regions
in the human genome using Primer3 (V0.4.0, default parameters). Primer
sequences: fwd 5’ -gcagtgcagaatggcaagt-3’ ; reV 5’ -gcctcagcatattcatctcca-
3’. Total RNA from LNCaP and RWPE-l cells (human prostate
cancer cells) was extracted using TRIZOLTM reagent according to the
manufacturers” instructions (Invitrogen). To eliminate genomic DNA, a
DNase digestion was performed using the TURBO DNA-freeTM Kit
(Applied Biosystems/Ambion, manufacturers instructions). Next, lug
of total RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScriptTM III Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was isolated using DNeasy Blood
& Tissue Kit (Qiagen). PCRs were performed using Taq-DNA-Polymerase
(NEB) in a 30111 reaction containing 1111 cDNA or genomic DNA. PCR
products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels, extracted from the gel using
the MinElute Gel extraction Kit (Qiagen). cloned using TOPO TA CloningR
(Invitrogen) and sent out for sequencing (Seqlab).

3 RESULTS

De novo splice site prediction: as illustrated in Figure 1, we trained
SVM Classiﬁer using the evolutionary signatures of vertebrate splice
sites to distinguish real from false splice sites. Indicating a good
discriminative power, our models achieved high AUC values of 0.96
for donors and 0.94 for acceptors (Fig. 1A). On an independent test
set with 5000 sites which were not used for training, we correctly
detected 89% of all true donors at a false positive rate (FPR) of 4
and 84% of all true acceptors at an FPR of 9% (SVM Classiﬁcation
conﬁdence p > 0.5). To reduce the FPR to less than 2%, we used a
more stringent SVM Classiﬁcation conﬁdence of p > 0.9, which still
correctly identiﬁes 81% (73%) of real donor (acceptor) sites. This

Fig. 1. Overview on the computational procedure to identify novel spliced transcripts in vertebrate genomes. (A) First, we extracted splice site candidates
from genome-wide alignments and set up a training set (left panel). We distinguished between (1) real annotated splice sites in genic regions; (11) false splice

sites in genic regions (GT/AG dinucleotides that were similar to real splice sites but were not supported by transcript data); and (iii) the remaining set of

intergenic splice site candidates. Secondly, we compiled a set of evolutionary signatures that are characteristic for vertebrate splice sites and trained donor
and acceptor SVM models (middle panel, ROC curves are shown for both models). Thirdly, these SVMs were used to classify intergenic candidates as either
real or false splice sites (right panel). (B) To obtain exon predictions, we searched for pairs of splice sites with a maximal distance of 300 nt (left), trained a

second SVM that considered features of EST-conﬁrmed exons (middle) and ranked predicted exons. Finally, predicted exons were then clustered into partial
multi-exon transcripts. (C) Several splice sites and exons/introns of the shown example are conﬁrmed by ESTs and short RNA-seq reads.

demonstrates that our approach is capable of identifying splice sites
at high speciﬁcity. Out of 54 million intergenic candidates, about
3.4 million sites were predicted to be real (p > 0.5).

Improved log-odds substitution scores: nucleotide substitutions in
splice sites are highly biased to certain substitution patterns that
follow the splice site consensus sequence (Supplementary Fig. S2
and S3A). This holds for protein-coding as well as non-coding
genes (Supplementary Fig. S2). For example, A and G are the
preferred nucleotides at the donor consensus position +3 and A/G
substitutions are the most frequent substitution at this position in real
donors. The pairwise approach used in Hiller et (11. (2009) considers
substitutions between a reference and orthologous sequences for
each alignment column (Fig. 2B). This can over- or underestimate

the real number of substitutions that happened in evolution. In
particular, if a strictly conserved base has Changed in the reference
sequence, the pairwise method will sum the log-odd scores for
all pairs reference ortholog, although only a single Change has
happened. To avoid these biases, we developed a method that
evaluates species- and site-speciﬁc substitution patterns along the
phylogeny of the aligned species (Fig. 2C). We reconstructed the
likely ancestral bases at each internal node in the phylogenetic
tree. This allowed us to compute log-odd scores that only consider
real substitutions. Our tree-based approach let to a noticeable
performance increase compared with the pairwise method, in
particular for low FPRs. Measuring the predictive power of either
method alone, the AUC improved from 0.68 to 0.72 for donor and
from 0.85 to 0.93 for acceptor sites (Fig. 2D). Acceptors, for which

Fig. 2. Log-odds substitution scores. Given an exemplary acceptor alignment (A), we compare the pairwise (B) and the tree-based (C) approach to score splice
site substitutions, here focusing on substitutions at alignment column -5. While the pairwise method evaluates 13 substitutions (B), the tree-based method
considers only eight that likely happened along the phylogenetic tree (C). The leaves of the tree represent the sequences of extant species, and inner nodes
reﬂect the reconstructed ancestral state. Substitutions with positive log-odd scores happen more frequently in the evolution of real than false splice sites. (D)

ROC curves demonstrate that the tree-based method (sues) signiﬁcantly outperforms the pairwise method (spak) for both donor and acceptor sites.

we score a longer region that comprises the poly-pyrimidine tract,
particularly beneﬁt from this novel scoring scheme.

Prediction of exons based on individual splice sites: we obtained
311 616 candidate exons from de novo predicted splice sites (p > 0.5)
of which 1521 (0.5%) exons were conﬁrmed by ESTs. The purpose
of the second SVM (exon-SVM) is to rank these preliminary
candidates. Trained on a subset of most reliably EST-conﬁrmed
exons (334/1521), the SVM achieved an AUC of 0.92 (Fig. 1B).
In addition, we validated the performance on a different test set
consisting of 9333 real and 4722 false Re f Seq exons whose splice
sites were correctly Classiﬁed by the splice site SVM and have not
been used for training. At p>0.5, we obtained an AUC of 0.88
(Supplementary Fig. S7) with a TPR of 78% (7262/9333) and a FPR
of 11% (537/4722). Atp > 0.9, we still obtained 38% (3528/9333)
TPR and 1% (57/4722) FPR. We applied the exon-SVM to the
remaining exon candidates that were not used for training. Finally,
8832 candidate exons were predicted to be real at conﬁdence p > 0.5
(898 exons atp > 0.9).

Conﬁrmation by RNA-seq data and recent RefSeq annotations:
The RNA-seq data published by Wang et a1. (2008) provide
evidence for transcription of 5% (469/8832) of predicted exons
(Supplementary Table S10). To test if deeper sequencing might
conﬁrm more exon predictions, we used only a fraction of their
data for validation. We observed that the number of conﬁrmed
exons increases linearly with the fraction of RNA-seq reads without
saturation (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S9), which suggests that
additional data are likely to verify additional predictions.

To evaluate tissue-speciﬁc expression, we found that only 14 of
the 469 exons conﬁrmed by RNA-seq are supported by reads from at
least 10 of the 15 tissues/cell lines. The 281 exons are only supported
by reads from a single tissue. This Clearly indicates tissue-speciﬁc

transcription of these genes, in agreement with previous ﬁndings
from Wang et al. (2008).

The human gene catalog is continuously updated and reﬁned.
Therefore, we expect that some of our predictions, unknown at the
time we made them, are now validated by new annotations. Indeed,
44 of our predicted and previously unknown exons have meanwhile
been included in the Ref Seq transcript annotation. For example, a
complete predicted Cluster consisting of ﬁve exons is now part of the
ofﬁcial consensus gene structure of the NEB gene (Supplementary
Fig. S8).

Predicted exons form potential multi-exon transcripts: Of total, 8%
(734 of 8832) of the predicted exons form 336 Clusters (3 2 exons
separated by at most 6kb). With up to seven adjacent exons, these
Clusters are parts of potential multi-exon transcripts.

The remaining 8098 exons that are not in Clusters might still
belong to multi-exon transcripts for the following reasons. First,
our approach can only detect internal exons that are ﬂanked by a
donor and acceptor site. In particular, the ﬁrst exon (lacking an
acceptor) and the last exon (lacking a donor) cannot be detected,
which means that only genes with at least four exons (containing at
least two internal exons) can form Clusters. Second, our method is
optimized for speciﬁcity not sensitivity and is likely to miss other
exons belonging to the same transcript. Third, lncRNAs have fewer
exons than coding genes, decreasing the Chance to detect Clusters.
Finally, our cut-off for the maximum intron length of 6kb prevents
the detection of Clusters for transcripts having longer introns.

To assess if the number of 336 Clusters is higher than expected by
Chance, we used a simulation that builds exon Clusters from an equal
number of exons receiving low SVM conﬁdence scores (p<0.5).
Running the simulation 10000 times, we never obtained 336 or
more Clusters, yielding an empirical P-value < 10‘5 . Remarkably,
this remains true when empirical P-values are computed separately

Computational discovery of human transcripts

 

for Clusters with cardinalities between two and seven exons. The
predicted exons thus have a strong tendency to form potential multi-
exon transcripts, which makes them good candidates for novel
protein-coding genes and lncRNAs.

The 336 Clusters contain 505 exon—exon junctions of which
RNA-seq reads (Wang et al., 2008) veriﬁed 46 (9%). Interestingly,
29% of the predicted exons in Clusters are independently predicted
by coding gene ﬁnders, indicating that they are part of multi-exon
coding genes (Supplementary Table S9). For all predicted exons that
do not Cluster, 7.5% are predicted by coding gene ﬁnders, which
can be due to a higher false positive rate in these exons but also the
fact that lncRNAs have fewer exons than coding genes (Guttman
et al., 2010). The latter, in particular, complicates the prediction of
linCRNAs which on average have only 1.7 internal exons.

Predicted exons are mostly non-protein-coding and unstructured:
only 8% (674 of 8832) of predicted exons have homology to protein-
Coding genes, 40% (3508 of 8832) have stop codons in all three
reading frames, and 92% (8124 of 8832) are Classiﬁed as non-
coding by RNAcode (Washietl et al., 2011). This shows that the

Fig. 3. Deeper sequencing will likely conﬁrm further exon predictions. We
split the data of Wang et al. (2008) to subsets containing 25, 50 and 75%
of all reads and computed the corresponding number of conﬁrmed exons.
We repeated this procedure ﬁve times to avoid biases of a single random
split. Error bars show the minimum and maximum of the ﬁve iterations.
Since the number of conﬁrmed exons increases almost linearly with the
number of reads, it is likely that future sequencing projects will provide
further experimental evidence for our approach.

great majority (89% or 7894) of predicted exons and exon-Clusters
(241 /336) is likely non-coding.

We found RNAz hits in only 1.2% (94 of 7894) of the non-coding
exons. This fraction is not higher than for coding exons (1.7%, 16 of
938). Furthermore, only 7% (35 of 505) of the predicted exon—exon
junctions and 14% (46 of 336) of all exon Clusters contain RNAz
hits. This indicates that our predicted loci are mostly unstructured
or do not contain conserved secondary structures and consequently
cannot be detected by structure-based nCRNA ﬁnders.

Experimental validation of a predicted multi-exon transcript:
Clusters of predicted exons with highest cardinality are prime
candidates for novel genes. Our data contain two such top-scoring
Clusters, each consisting of seven adjacent exons (Fig. 4A and
B). The ﬁrst Cluster is conﬁrmed by ESTs and, according to
BLASTX, likely protein coding. The second Cluster has RNA-seq
support for only one exon—exon junction. Therefore, we designed
primers to positions in the human genome that allow to verify
the remaining predicted transcript. We used RT—PCR in a human
prostate cancer cell line and subsequent cDNA sequencing. This
conﬁrmed eight of the nine predicted splice sites and three of ﬁve
predicted exons (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, our experiments revealed
complex alternative splicing at this locus with ﬁve different isoforms
in prostate cancer cells. These contain even additional novel exons,
neither detected by existing methods nor by our current approach.

4 DISCUSSION

We present a computational procedure to identify novel spliced
transcripts in vertebrate genomes using conserved splice sites and
signatures of length-constrained exons. We deliberately neglect
features of protein-coding genes and outline a ﬁrst conceptual
approach toward the de novo prediction of lncRNAs.

We have previously demonstrated the value of conserved introns
for the prediction of conserved, and hence likely ﬁinctional, mRNAs
in insect genomes (Hiller et al., 2009). In this work, we now tackled
the problem of applying this conceptual idea to vertebrate genomes,
where ab initio splice site and intron prediction is Challenging due
to the drastically increased absolute length and length variability

of vertebrate introns. We developed a two step procedure that ﬁrst
predicts novel splice sites, which are in a second step combined to
predicted exons. A key improvement is a novel log-odds score for
splice site substitutions that explicitly takes the phylogenetic tree
into account, avoiding biases of previous approaches. We show that
this tree-based method substantially improves the power of splice
site detection and outperforms two other approaches. The general
concept behind this tree-based method can be applied to detect
other biologically relevant signals and motifs in multiple sequence
alignments.

Our predicted exons and exon clusters mostly belong to non-
coding transcripts. These transcripts also rarely contain conserved
secondary structures. This means that current methods to ﬁnd coding
genes or structured ncRNAs will miss most of our predictions and
that our approach complements existing methods.

High-throughput transcriptome sequencing has led to the
discovery of many unknown exons and transcripts. However, for
the following reasons we believe that ab initio computational
predictions of conserved transcripts complement experimental
approaches. First, tissue-speciﬁc transcripts can only be detected
when a large variety of conditions such as cell types, tissues, time
points is sampled. Second, detecting transcripts with low expression
levels requires sufﬁciently deep sequencing. These limitations are
particularly relevant for ncRNAs, which often have low and highly
speciﬁc expression patterns (Mercer et al., 2008; Ravasi et al.,
2006). Consistent with this and the fact that our predictions are
mostly non-coding, we observed that more transcript data lead
to the conﬁrmation of more predictions without any observable
saturation. Furthermore, our predictions conﬁrmed by transcriptome
sequencing data mostly have tissue-speciﬁc expression patterns.
While our predictions will inevitably contain false positives,
these observations suggest the existence of further evolutionarily
conserved, and hence likely ﬁinctional, multi-exon transcripts that
still remain hidden in the human genome. Future increases in
transcriptome sequencing depth and breadth will conﬁrm additional
predictions. Also, our exon and transcript predictions can be included
in ongoing large-scale RT—PCR based efforts to ﬁirther validate
human gene predictions (Harrow et al., 2006). Our approach
complements other gene prediction approaches and contributes to
completing the catalog of human transcripts.

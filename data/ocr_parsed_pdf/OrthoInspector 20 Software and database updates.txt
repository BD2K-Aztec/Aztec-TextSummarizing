ABSTRACT

Summary: We previously developed Ortholnspector, a package incor-
porating an original algorithm for the detection of orthology and inpar-
alogy relations between different species. We have added new
functionalities to the package. While its original algorithm was not
modified, performing similar orthology predictions, we facilitated the
prediction of very large databases (thousands of proteomes), refur-
bished its graphical interface, added new visualization tools for com-
parative genomics/protein family analysis and facilitated its
deployment in a network environment. Finally, we have released
three online databases of precomputed orthology relationships.
Availability: Package and databases are freely available at http://lbgi.
fr/orthoinspector with all major browsers supported.

1 INTRODUCTION

High throughput comparative analyses, functional annotations,
or evolutionary studies involve massive transfers of information
between organisms using orthology inference. As deﬁned by
Fitch (1970), orthologs are homologous genes that diverged
from an ancestral speciation event, while paralogs emerged
from a duplication event. Today, it is widely accepted that ortho-
logs generally share similar functions, whereas paralogs can po-
tentially evolve new functions. Numerous algorithms based on
the results of Blast searches were developed to infer orthology
relations (see Kristensen et al., 2011; Altenhoff and Dessimoz,
2012 for reviews). We previously developed an orthology infer-
ence algorithm also based on Blast and implemented it in the
Ortholnspector (01) package (Linard et al., 2011). Our focus was
to maintain a balance between sensitivity and speciﬁcity (Linard
et al., 2011; Dalquen et al., 2013). Contrary to most other pack-
ages, 01 is not limited to predictions and provides tools for com-
prehensive mining of large orthology databases, nonspecialist use
through a desktop graphical interface and can easily be deployed
in a network environment. Here, we describe the main improve-
ments implemented in the second version of the Ortholnspector
package.

2 DISTINCTIVE FEATURES

2.1 Requirements

01 2.0 requires the NCBI b1ast+ toolkit (Camacho et al., 2009),
a Java compatible operating system and a local or remote access
to a SQL database. Any SQL engine is compatible as long as it
allows Java connections Via a JDBC driver. 01 provides an ex-
tended support for Postgresql and MySQL engines, for which
more operations are automated. To predict new orthologs, 01
requires as inputs one proteome in FASTA format per species of
interest and a blast all-against-all constructed from the same
proteomes.

2.2 Implementation and network exploitation

The package is based on database/client interactions and sepa-
rated into three clients (Fig. 1A): a command-line for initial
orthology predictions and database installation, a query com-
mand-line to retrieve precomputed predictions and a graphical
interface designed for desktop querying and data Visualization.
Limited computational resources are required as the clients dele-
gate many operations to the SQL engines and their optimized
dataset manipulation capabilities. Management of large data-
bases (thousands of species) is, however, facilitated by several
options from the installation command-line. The components
of the graphical interface make easier the mining and the Visual-
ization of complex orthology relationships for nonspecialists. A
small 6six species database dump can be downloaded from the
website to rapidly test these tools. The three clients can be used
on a single desktop computer but can also be deployed in a
network. Orthology databases can then be stored in one server
while several users/pipelines exploit the clients for various pur-
poses (Fig. 1B). Then, 01 responsiveness will mainly depend on
server and network speed.

2.3 Eukaryote and prokaryote databases

We have constructed three orthology databases with 01. The
ﬁrst database, named “Prokaryotes,” contains orthologs between
120 Archaea and 1568 Bacteria proteomes. The “Eukaryotes”
dataset contains 259 complete proteomes and covers all main
eukaryotic phyla, from unicellular organisms to plants, fungi,
and metazoan. The last dataset, “Quest For Orthologs”
(QFO), combines bacteria, archaea and eukaryote proteomes
and corresponds to the latest version of the orthology bench-
mark released by the QFO Consortium (Dessimoz et al., 2012).

3 MAIN ADDITIONS
3.1 Large-scale phylogenetic proﬁles

Several analyses are now supported by an interactive tree of life
in the graphical interface, facilitating in particular the establish-
ment of “phylogenetic proﬁle” queries. A selection of presence/
absence criteria at different levels in the tree, allows the extrac-
tion of large-scale sets of genes that respect the proﬁle through
the orthology criteria. For instance, one can retrieve all
Microsporidia sequences with orthologs in Basidiomycota but
not in Ascomycota (Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.2 Best-hit density graph and Euler diagrams

Two new Visualization tools are now part of the graphical inter-
face. First, the “best—hit density graph” is designed to analyze the
orthologous relationships linking genes in a particular family and
to reveal potential subfamilies. Through a dynamic graph repre-
sentation of BLAST best hits linking a protein family, the user
can explore conservation patterns within the set by modifying the

BLAST score or E—Value thresholds on the ﬂy (Supplementary
File S3). This tool can be used to adapt the delineation of sub-
families to the evolutionary rate of the family under consider-
ation or to a given phylogenetic scope. Second, Venn diagrams
(3 organisms), but also more complex Euler diagrams (>3 organ-
isms), can be generated. When more than 3 organisms are con-
sidered, diagram overlaps are based on the VennEuler library
(Wilkinson, 2012), which provides a statistical framework to es-
timate the best possible circle-based representation.

3.3 Web server

Our precomputed datasets (Eukaryote, Prokaryote, and QFO)
can be accessed Via a web server allowing ortholog retrieval by
textual or Blastp searches. A list of organisms can be selected
with an interactive species tree. Orthology relationships corres-
ponding to the query sequence are compiled in a table format
with phylum color codes to facilitate the analysis of phylum
speciﬁc orthology distributions and produce a user-friendly and
intuitive overview of the revealed evolutionary history (see
Supplementary File S4 for a case study). All datasets can be
downloaded in CSV and OrthoXML formats (Schmitt et al.,
2011).

4 CONCLUSION

01 is a package dedicated to the efﬁcient calculation and analysis
of orthology data and allows a rapid and intuitive analysis of
relationships associated with large clades. The 01 web server
allows the retrieval of precomputed orthology data from thou-
sands of eukaryote and prokaryote proteomes.

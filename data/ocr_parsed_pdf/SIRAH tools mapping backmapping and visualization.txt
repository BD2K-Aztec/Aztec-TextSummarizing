Abstract

Summary: Coarse—grained (CG) models reduce the cost of molecular dynamics simulations keep—
ing the essence of molecular interactions. Still, the diversity of CG representations (sizes, connect—
ivity, naming, etc.) hampers the handling and visualization of such models. SIRAH Tools comprises
a set of utilities to convert all—atoms coordinates to arbitrary residue—based CG schemes, write
GROMACS’ topological information at any resolution into PSF format and a VMD plugin to visual—
ize, analyze and retrieve pseudo—atomistic information from CG trajectories performed with the
SIRAH force field. These tools facilitate the use of intricate CG force fields outside the small devel—

oper’s community.

Availability and implementation: Different utilities of SIRAH Tools are written in Perl, Tcl, or R.

1 Introduction

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations constitute a reliable approach
for the study of bimolecular structures, dynamics and interactions
(Karplus and Lavery, 2014). However, its computational cost has
prompted the development of coarse—grained (CG) models aimed to
reach ever—growing size and timescales. In general, different mapping
schemes are used to provide CG representations from all—atoms (AA)
molecular systems (Ingélfsson et (11., 2014), making difficult the creation
and editing of molecular topology ﬁles. Moreover, arbitrary CG
schemes can be challenging for general—purposes visualization programs
to yield correct rendering, molecular connectivity, beads’ size, charges,
etc. To overcome such difficulties we created a series of utilities named
SIRAH Tools, which are distributed within the SIRAH force field pack—
age for CG and multiscale simulations (see Darré et (11., 2015 and refer—
ences therein). SIRAH Tools is freely available along with tutorials for
running and analyzing CG simulations at http://www.sirahff.com.

2 SIRAH tools features

2.1 Mapping AAto CG models
SIRAH Tools contains the Perl script cgconv.pl that takes as input
AA files in PDB or PQR format and transforms residue coordinates

to CG following mapping rules described in, so called, map files.
Three mapping functions are currently available: CMASS, CGEOM
and MAP. For CMASS and CGEOM, the atoms specified are
mapped to their center of mass or geometry, respectively. If MAP is
used, the positions of single atoms are given to CG beads. Though
SIRAH mapping is used by default, user—created files can be read
from the command line, the flag —h displays all available options.
Mapping can also be restricted to sets of residues to build multi—
resolution systems (Machado and Pantano, 2015).

2.2 Converting GROMACS’ topologies to PSF
Molecular visualization programs guess the connectivity of AA sys—
tems from standard interatomic distances and angles. However, this
is difficult for arbitrary CG representations and topological informa—
tion must be supplied in additional files, e.g. AMBER’s topology
(Salomon—Ferrer et (11., 2013) or X—PLOR PSF files (Brooks et (11.,
2009). However, GROMACS’ topologies (Pronk et (11., 2013) are
not currently supported by visualization software. SIRAH’s
_top2psf.pl converts GROMACS’ topologies to PSF files interpret—
ing the ‘#include’ statements used to consider chains, solvent mol—
ecules, ligands, etc., being equally useful for AA, multiscale or
arbitrary CG topologies.

2.3 Visualization and structural analysis of CG systems
The sirah_vmdtk.tcl plugin improves the visualization and analysis
of CG trajectories with VMD (Humphrey et (11., 1996). This plugin
sets correct van der Waals radii, coloring code by atom and residue
types and macros for selecting molecular components on SIRAH tra—
jectories (Fig. 1A). The utility sirah_ss assigns secondary structures
to CG proteins in SIRAH classifying amino acids in or—helix (H), ex—
tended B—sheet (E) or, otherwise, coil (C) conformations, based on
the instantaneous values of the backbone’s torsional angles and
Hydrogen bond—like (HB) interactions (Darré et (11., 2015 ).
Comparing the assignments of sirah_ss with STRIDE (Frishman and
Argos, 1995), we find ~90% of agreement between both methods
(Fig. 1B). Sirah_ss produces ASCII files of average and by—frame re—
sults, which can be visualized as a color matrix using the R script
ssmtx2png.R (see, for instance, Fig. 7C in Darré et (11., 2015).

2.4 Backmapping CG coordinates to AA

The sirah_vmdtk.tcl plugin also includes the module sirah_backmap
to retrieve pseudo—atomistic information from CG models. The
atomistic positions are built on a by—residue basis following the

Fig. 1. SIRAH Tools features. (A) Molecular visualization of protein 1RA4 at
CG level embedded in explicit solvent showing the connectivity of the sys-
tem. The backbone is colored by secondary structure (H: purple, E: yellow, C:
white) as calculated by sirahiss. Amino acids are shown in CPK and depicted
by physicochemical characteristics according to VMD standard coloring
code. Excluded volumes are shown as semitransparent balls. (B) Percentage
of residues with same secondary structure assignment by sirahiss and
STRIDE. The inset compares sirahiss against STRIDE to estimate global con-
tent of H or E conformations. The analysis was performed on 3000 proteins
from the PDB with resolution lower than 0.2 nm, identity less than 90% and
no modified residues. (C) Structural quality of backmapped trajectories as
evaluated by MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010). Reported values correspond to
the average calculated on 1 us of MD simulation (Color version of this figure

geometrical reconstruction proposed by (Parsons et (11., 2005).
Brieﬂy, atomic positions are generated from the location of CG
beads or previously reconstructed atoms using internal coordinates.
Bond distances and angles are derived from rough organic chemistry
considerations stored in backmapping libraries. Currently, back—
mapping libraries contain instructions for proteins and DNA of
SIRAH, but user—defined procedures can be easily included for other
models. Although plane AA reconstructions may result in poor
stereochemistry conformations, this is readily fixed performing en—
ergy minimization using an AA force field, making the procedure ro—
bust and independent of the fine details of the backmapping library.
The present implementation runs 100 steps of steepest—descent fol—
lowed by 50 steps of Conjugated Gradient minimization in vacuum
using the sander module of AmberTools (Salomon—Ferrer et (11.,
2013). Clearly, the accuracy of the reconstruction depends on the
CG model. Backmapping of four SIRAH CG trajectories from
(Darré et (11., 2010, 2015) results in good structural descriptors (Fig.
1C). As a stringent test, we calculated the HB conservation
(Hydrogens are often lost in CG models). The conservation of HB
calculated with a Donor—Acceptor cutoff of 0.4 nm and 120° be—
tween Donor—H—Acceptor varied from 12% (s.d. 1) for 1QYO up to
24% (s.d. 3) for both 1RA4 and 1TQG. These numbers raised to
45% (s.d. 4), 59% (s.d. 5) and 64% (s.d. 4), for 1QYO, 1RA4 and
1TQG, respectively, if we only consider the backbone interaction
associated to the secondary structure, while the DNA kept a 74%
(s.d. 5) of HR in the Watson—Crick region.

3 Conclusion

CG models are considerably expanding. Yet, their visualization and
analysis still suffers from limitations that restrict their use to highly
skilled users. SIRAH tools aims to bridge this gap by providing easy
and ﬂexible mapping utilities, processing of topologies and data
analysis.

modeling that relies on optimization—based algorithms. The pre—
dominant aim is to detect metabolites that cannot be produced at
a steady state (Latendresse et al., 2012; Ponce—de Leon et al.,
2013; Satish Kumar et al., 2007).

Here we report ASBIG (Autocatalytic Set—Based Identiﬁcation
of Gaps), a method that detects incomplete parts of network
reconstructions based on a novel approach: identifying elements
(compounds) of catalytic cycles. ASBIG screens models for
essential, self—replicating metabolites, which are pivotal elements
of the underlying metabolism. A metabolite is considered to be
pivotal if it is required for metabolism to proceed. The com—
pounds are called ‘self—replicating’, or ‘autocatalytic’, as they
are usually required for their own biosynthesis (Kun et al.,
2008). Hence, their production is inaccessible unless an initial
amount of the compound is already available. Self—replicating
metabolites are energy—currency cofactors, such as ATP and
NAD. If these compounds are not present within the cell, even
a rich nutritional medium is often insufﬁcient for an organism to
produce all of its biomass components. The definition of self—
replicating metabolites originates from the work of Eigen and
Schuster (1977), in which the concepts of catalytic cycles and
autocatalysis were described on a molecular level. The search
for autocatalytic compounds is conducted via the method of
scope analysis (Handorf et al., 2005).

The set of self—replicators in each network reconstruction
is generally small (Kun et al., 2008). Furthermore, autocatalytic
sets of different organisms very likely contain similar
well—conserved compounds. These observations can be used to
survey any given metabolic network to detect inherent inconsis—
tencies. If the number of self—replicating compounds is compar—
ably large or unexpected elements and large macromolecules are
included in the set, conclusions about possible inconsistencies
can be drawn. Hence, gaps in the reconstructed network can
lead to the presence of unexpected compounds in the set of
self—replicators (owing to the impaired biosynthesis of this com—
pound or its successors).

ASBIG enriches the tool box of gap—ﬁnding procedures, as
common ﬁux calculating methods are susceptible to overlook
gaps associated with autocatalytic cycles. One simple example
is a cofactor that is required for the production of a biomass
component but itself is not present in the biomass reaction. In
such a case, it would be sufﬁcient for constraint—based methods,
such as FBA, if reactions that replenish the cofactor exist to
produce biomass. A biosynthetic route of this essential cofactor
would not be required making the detection of a lack of this
route impossible for FBA. ASBIG uses scope analysis to deter—
mine such inconsistencies. Although this approach disregards the
exact stoichiometric properties of metabolic reactions, our
method is not susceptible to problems known to occur when
using purely topology—based procedures (de Figueiredo et al.,
2008).

To outline the beneﬁt of ASBIG, selected reconstructions from
the following organisms were examined: Ecoli, Arabidopsis thali—
ana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, and Zea mays (Table 1). Using our method, we were
able to identify missing pathways in all of these networks except
for the Ecoli reconstruction. Subsequently, the detected incon—
sistencies were resolved using information from the KEGG data—
base (Kanehisa et al., 2006) and other resources, like BioCyc,

BsubCyc (Caspi et al., 2010) or the Plant metabolic pathway
database (Zhang et al., 2010). Furthermore, all available recon—
structions of the Model SEED project (Henry et al., 2010) have
been screened to demonstrate the applicability of the method on
a large scale. As one substantial beneﬁt of this screening,
common inconsistencies widespread across numerous models
were identified. Additionally, ASBIG detected missing reactions
that were deleted manually from the model of Ecoli for valid—
ation purposes, demonstrating the reliability and applicability of
our method.

In summary, ASBIG is a reliable method for the detection
of inconsistencies in any metabolic network reconstruction.
It provides an efﬁcient approach to validate metabolic models.
By pinpointing discrepancies of network reconstructions, the
method supports the improvement of the high number of incom—
plete models generated by high—throughput methods. Thus,
ASBIG can signiﬁcantly contribute to improve the quality of
metabolic network reconstructions.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1 Models

ASBIG uses a genome-scale reconstruction of metabolic networks as
input. It was applied to investigate the following models: iJOl366
of E.coli K-12 MG1655, iBSU1103 of B.subtilis 168, AraGEM of
A.thaliana, iRClOSO of C.reinhardtii, iMM904 of Scerevisiae and
DTMaize_C4GEM_45632 of Z.mays. Additionally, >190 models
provided by the Model SEED project (Henry et al., 2010) (as available
in October 2012) were screened.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of autocatalytic metabolic sets

The algorithm was implemented in JAVA. Genome-scale metabolic
networks are processed in the standardized Systems Biology Markup
Language using the JAVA package jigcell.sbml2 (Vass et al., 2004).

2.3 Initial set of metabolites (seed set)

A predeﬁned set of metabolites, named ‘initial seed set’, acts as the start-
ing point for ASBIG. It combines the components of a nutritional
medium with additional pivotal elements. The set of additional elements
is composed of two subsets: metabolites identiﬁed as crucial by ASBIG
(see Section 3.1) and autocatalytic compounds whose biosynthesis
depends on their own presence (cf. Kun et al., 2008). These were as
follows: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-
tide (NAD) and coenzyme A (CoA).

Hence, the composition of the initial seed set is assumed to include all
essential components necessary for the growth of the organism.

2.4 Scope analysis

ASBIG uses the concept of scopes (Handorf et al., 2005), which can be
determined for a given sets of metabolites. The scope is a (large) set of
metabolites and corresponds to all compounds that can, in principle, be
produced from a (small) predeﬁned set of metabolites. The concept of
scope analysis relies on three aspects (Handorf et al., 2005) (i) a reaction is
considered to take place if all of its substrates (or products in the case of
reversible reactions) have non-zero concentrations, (ii) products of one
reaction are immediately considered as potential substrates of another
one and (iii) starting with a small set of metabolites, iteratively increasing
sets of reactions (and metabolites) are generated by screening the model
for further reactions with a non-zero ﬂux. The fundamental principle

2012), which requires trans,trans—farnesyl PP to produce UDPP
(EC 2.5.1.31, Fig. 4). Apparently, the reaction EC 2.5.1.31 of the
model included an incorrect substrate assignment leading to the
substrate incorporation into the minimal seed set, a conﬁicting
minimal seed metabolite. The exchange of geranylgeranyl PP
with trans,trans—farnesyl PP in the reaction EC 2.5.1.31 resolved
the need for the conﬂicting minimal seed metabolite and
geranylgeranyl PP was eliminated from the minimal seed set.
The identiﬁcation of conﬂicting minimal seed metabolites dem—
onstrates the ability of ASBIG to detect wrongly implemented
reactants.

Despite the modiﬁcation of reaction EC 2.5.1.31, teichoic acid
remained in the minimal seed set because of its ability to provide
the PGL polymer to the metabolic scope (the backward reaction
of EC. 3.6.3.40 removes teichoic acid from PGL, Fig. 4).
To avoid this property of teichoic acid, a reaction, which trans—
forms multiple PGL monomers to a polymer, was implemented
in the model (Fig. 4, light gray dashed arrow). As a result, no
polymers had to be provided as self—replicators anymore, and
teichoic acid was eliminated from the ﬁnal minimal seed set.
To sum up, the application of ASBIG substantially improved
the integrity of the B.subti[is model iBSU1103 leading to a
more comprehensive representation of the in vivo metabolism.
Furthermore, the investigation of iBSU1103 illustrates central
characteristics of the method: computed add—on metabolites not
necessarily indicate the corresponding pathway or speciﬁc loca—
tion of an inconsistency, and the results generated by ASBIG can
suggest the inclusion of further functionality for the model.

3.2.4 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii The minimal seed set for
iRC1080, the metabolic model of Creinhardtii, contained
add—on metabolites that indicated the lack of functionalities
in some biosynthetic pathways. To access all components
of the biomass reaction, thiamine, glutathione, chorismate,
magnesium—protoporphyrin IX 13—monomethyl ester and
plastidic plastoquinone expanded the initial seed set.

The biosynthesis for thiamine was not implemented in the
model, likely because critical parts of the pathway still require
experimental conﬁrmation (Moulin et al., 2013). However, the
basic metabolic routes of de novo thiamine biosynthesis in
Creinhardtii are known, and the corresponding reactions could
be added to the model. After the implementation, thiamine lost
its autocatalytic property.

The presence of glutathione in the minimal seed set could be
linked to the biosynthetic pathway of cysteine. Assimilatory sul—
fate reduction in Creinhardtii depends on glutathione and leads
to the generation of hydrogen sulﬁde. Subsequently, hydrogen
sulﬁde can be incorporated into O—acetyl—L—serine to form cyst—
eine. Hence, it was assumed that hydrogen sulﬁde, glutathione
or cysteine were required to be part of the minimal seed set.
Three runs of ASBIG, each with one out of the three compo—
nents in the initial seed set, conﬁrmed this assumption
(and resulted, for hydrogen sulﬁde and cysteine, in the replace—
ment of glutathione in the minimal seed set).

It was further possible to identify an impaired biosynthesis of
chlorophyllide a explaining the presence of protoporphyrin IX
13—monomethyl ester in the minimal seed set. S—adenosyl—
L—methionine (SAM) was one of the substrates to produce the
protoporphyrin ester. Hence, another run of ASBIG was

performed with SAM included in the initial seed set. This led
to the removal of protoporphyrin IX 13—monomethyl ester,
implicating the relevance of SAM.

The essential character for both plastidic SAM and cytosolic
chorismate could be explained with a missing transport reaction
between plastid and cytosol or missing biosynthetic pathways in
one of the compartments. A putative transport enzyme could
overcome this lack in both cases, even though no such trans—
porters have been identiﬁed in Creinhardtii yet. However, an
enzyme to import SAM into the chloroplast was reported for
A.thaliana (Bouvier et al., 2006). Therefore, the ﬁndings of
ASBIG highlight the need for further investigations of the meta—
bolic capabilities of Creinhardtii.

The putative plastoquinone biosynthetic pathway for
Creinhardtii is available in the KEGG database (KEGG: ubi—
quinone and other terpenoid—quinone biosynthesis). As it was
not integrated in the investigated Creinhardtii metabolic
model, plastoquinone possessed autocatalytic property. Despite
the lack of experimental evidence, the pathway was added to the
model. First, the network reconstruction had to be expanded by
two metabolites previously not implemented: nonaprenyl PP and
2—methyl—6—solanyl—1,4—benzoquinol. Nonaprenyl PP is the prod—
uct of the reaction of geranylgeranyl PP with ﬁve molecules of
isopentenyl PP (catalyzed by EC 2.5.1.85). Subsequently, nona—
prenyl PP reacts with homogentisate to form 2—methyl—6—solanyl—
1,4—benzoquinol (Merchant et al., 2007), which is further
converted to plastoquinone in a SAM—dependent reaction.
The enzyme involved in the plastoquinone formation is not yet
characterized, however, it is assumed that VT E3 codes for the
corresponding enzyme (Merchant et al., 2007). By adding
the aforementioned metabolic reactions to the Creinhardtii
model, plastoquinone lost its autocatalytic property and was
eliminated from the minimal seed set.

The results for the examined network reconstruction of
Creinhardtii, iRC1080, show the versatile capabilities
of ASBIG, for example, to identify inconsistencies that require
additional experimental investigation as shown for the case of
SAM or chorismate.

3.2.5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae In the S.cerevisiae model
iMM904, dolichol was identiﬁed as a crucial add—on metabolite
of the minimal seed set, implying an impaired biosynthesis of
the compound. A survey of the metabolic model conﬁrmed the
absence of the corresponding pathway, although the biosynthesis
of dolichol in S.cerevisiae has been previously described
(Grabinska and Palamarczyk, 2002). To implement the meta—
bolic route in the network reconstruction, several additions
were required: (i) the condensation of farnesyl PP with 13 units
of isopentenyl pyrophosphate to form polyprenyl PP (EC
2.5.1.87), (ii) the formation of polyprenol from polyprenyl PP
and water (both polyprenyl PP and polyprenol had to be imple—
mented as novel compounds in the model) and (iii) the conver—
sion of polyprenol to dolichol. Manual expansion of the network
reconstruction of S.cerevisiae provided access to the novel bio—
synthetic pathway of dolichol, thus eliminating the compound
from the minimal seed set.

Another unexpected metabolite in the minimal seed set
was NADP located in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER).
This compound remained in the minimal seed set because of

 

378

Computing autocatalytic sets to unravel inconsistencies

 

the lack of information on a potential pathway providing NADP
in the ER.

Even though dolichol is the only gap—indicating add—on
metabolite, the identiﬁcation of NADP as an autocatalytic com—
pound suggests general inconsistencies of the model.

3.2.6 Zea mays Application of ASBIG to the Z.mays model
DTMaize_C4GEM_45632 revealed four add—on metabolites in
the ﬁnal minimal seed set that required further investigation:
thiamine, NADP, undecaprenyl phosphate (UDP), and
4—methylthio—2—oxobutanoate (all localized in the cytosol).

Although maize is capable of thiamine biosynthesis, the
pathway has not yet been fully characterized (Belanger et al.,
1995), and thus, is not entirely represented within the metabolic
network model. As a result, the biosynthetic route of thiamine
was blocked and thiamine had to be incorporated in the minimal
seed set. With the future availability of novel information, the
model can be improved by additionally including this speciﬁc
biosynthetic pathway.

The absence of a cytosolic NAD kinase necessitated NADP to
be an element of the minimal seed set. However, transcriptome
analysis and automated annotation suggested the existence
of a functional NAD kinase in Z.mays (UniProt ID:
B6TAB2_MAIIZE) (Alexandrov et al., 2009). Therefore, the re—
action (EC 2.7.1.23) was added leading to the elimination of
NADP from the minimal seed set.

Subsequently, the crucial character of UDP was examined
and a missing reaction to phosphorylate uridine 5’—phosphate
(UMP) to UDP in UTP biosynthetic pathway was identiﬁed.
As for the NAD kinase, transcriptome data and electronic
annotation (UniProt ID: B6T904_MAIZE) (Alexandrov
et al., 2009) suggested the presence of a functional UMP
kinase. Hence, the detected gap could be resolved by imple—
menting the additional reaction, thus eliminating UDP from
the minimal seed set.

The application of the more restrictive ‘producibility
constraint’ during the seed set expansion (see Section 2) allowed
to link the autocatalytic metabolite 4—methylthio—2—oxobutanoate
with the biosynthetic pathway of methionine. 4—Methylthio—
2—oxobutanoate was part of the minimal seed set owing to its
ability to bypass a blocked canonical methionine biosynthetic
pathway (KEGG: map00270). It was assumed that a limited
availability of cysteine, an essential intermediate in the methio—
nine biosynthesis, caused the blocked methionine production
(see also cysteine biosynthesis in Creinhardtii). By adding
cysteine to the initial seed set, folate instead of 4—methylthio—
2—oxobutanoate was represented as an essential add—on metabol—
ite of the minimal seed set. Evidently, the canonical methionine
biosynthetic pathway was inaccessible unless cysteine and folate
(or precursors/intermediates of the corresponding pathways)
were part of the minimal seed set. A derivative of folate, the
methyl group donor methyltetrahydropteroyltri—L—glutamate, is
vital for the last step of the methionine biosynthesis (Hanson
and Gregory, 2011). However, the biosynthesis of folate and
its derivatives was impaired in the model, likely because the
in vivo pathway is not yet fully understood (Hesse et al., 2004),
leading to the inevitable role of folate. Comparable with thia—
mine, the implementation of the biosynthetic pathway in the

model depends on additional experiments to elucidate folate bio—
synthesis in Z.mays.

Another inconsistency in the last step of the methionine bio—
synthesis was identiﬁed: According to literature, the triglutamate
of methyltetrahydrofolate (MeTHF), methyltetrahydropteroyl—
tri—L—glutamate, acts as the substrate for the methionine
synthase (EC 2.1.1.14) (Eckermann et al., 2000; Eichel et al.,
1995). In the Z.mays model, this enzyme used ‘pure’ MeTHF
as methyl donor (Fig. 4), indicating a conﬁicting minimal seed
metabolite. Additionally, another methionine—producing
reaction (EC 2.4.2.7), which involved methyltetrahydropteroyl—
tri—L—glutamate as substrate, was available. However, the latter
reaction was misassigned, as the denoted EC number character—
izes an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7).
Thus, methyltetrahydropteroyltri—L—glutamate was implemented
as substrate for the methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.14), and
the redundant misassigned reaction (EC 2.4.2.7) was deleted.
As the Z.mays model lacked the reactions necessary for the
transfer of the single carbon to tetrahydropteroyltri—L—glutamate,
the triglutamate of MeTHF replaced folate (precursor of
MeTHF) in the final minimal seed set. Although the exact mech—
anism of the methyl group transfer is not completely character—
ized for plants, the basic pathway composed of two reactions
is known (Ravanel et al., 1998). Hence, the pathway was imple—
mented in the model to connect methyltetrahydropteroyltri—
L—glutamate with the folate metabolism. Subsequently, folate
and cysteine were part of the minimal seed set again and enabled
methionine biosynthesis.

Each of the four identiﬁed add—on metabolites indicates substan—
tial restrictions in the Z.mays model DTMaize_C4GEM_45632.
Even though not each issue could be resolved, the results of
ASBIG provide valuable indications to the Z.mays model for
improvements.

3.3 Application to automatically reconstructed networks

To further scrutinize the ability of ASBIG to improve the
consistency of metabolic network reconstructions, we analyzed
193 genome—scale metabolic networks, which have been recon—
structed automatically based on the organisms’ genome
sequences and genomic annotations (Henry et al., 2010).
Among all models, 234 different metabolites were identiﬁed as
crucial elements in the final minimal seed set after adding them
during scope analysis. This list of compounds suggested that
reactions were possibly missing in the biosynthetic pathways
linked to these metabolites (Supplementary Table S1). A median
of 6 additional compounds per model, necessary to facilitate bio—
mass production, was identiﬁed (Supplementary Fig. S2). In 69%
of all models, PGL polymer (n71 subunits) was identified as an
inevitable compound. Peptidoglycan polymers are found in the
membranes of bacteria and occur with a varying number of sub—
units (Vollmer and Holtje, 2004). The elongation and shortening
of this polymer are included in the models, but not the de novo
biosynthesis. Furthermore, in multiple models, which were ana—
lyzed by ASBIG, external spermidine (47%), the glutamate—ac—
cepting tRNA (26%), thiamine (24%), external alanylhistidine
(22%) and glycyl—L—asparagine (21%) were frequently identiﬁed
as compounds that could not be synthesized. The recurrence of
these compounds might be owing to missing knowledge of

 

379

ﬁm'spzumofpmJXO'sopeuuopnorq/ﬁdnq

R.Schmidt et al.

 

possible biosynthetic routes or owing to properties of the recon—
struction process (all 193 automated reconstructions analyzed
here were generated using the same procedure) (Henry et al,
2010). On the other hand, 194 of the 243 compounds were identi—
ﬁed in <5% of all automated reconstructions analyzed, suggesting
model—speciﬁc gaps or errors in the reconstruction or actual
auxotrophies of the organisms.

Taken together, our analysis of a wide range of different auto—
matically reconstructed metabolic networks reveals that several
metabolites have an autocatalytic property or are inevitable for
biomass production. The identiﬁcation of these autocatalytic
metabolites using ASBIG can improve the quality of the recon—
struction by suggesting that the de novo biosynthetic pathways of
the identified metabolites are either incomplete or missing.

3.4 Validation of ASBIG on auxotrophic mutants of
E.coli

As mentioned above, no gaps were identiﬁed in the Ecoli
model iJOl366. Using this network, we knocked out reactions,
recalculated the minimal seed set and compared the changes
with reported experimental phenotypes of single—gene deletion
mutants of Ecoli K12 derivatives (Bertels et al, 2012). Using
this approach, we were able to validate ASBIG in terms of the
methods potential to predict gene essentiality as well as altered
nutritional requirements of mutants compared with the wild
type strain. We deleted 10 reactions, one at the time, each
one in the biosynthetic pathways of a speciﬁc amino acid.
The deleted reactions correspond to gene deletions, which are
known to cause a speciﬁc auxotrophy for the focal amino acid
of the mutant strain (Bertels et al, 2012). For each of the
mutated networks, ASBIG identified an add—on metabolite,
which was necessary to ensure biomass production. The add—
on metabolite was the ﬁnal product (the amino acid) of the
affected pathway, an intermediate within the pathway or a
derivative of the focal amino acid (for an overview see
Supplementary Table S2). Hence, the output of ASBIG reﬂects
the auxotrophy of the mutant strain impressively demonstrat—
ing the capability of ASBIG to detect gaps within primary
metabolic pathways.

4 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, ASBIG is an efﬁcient method for detecting incon—
sistencies in existing genome—scale metabolic network reconstruc—
tions. The method facilitates network validation and automated
gap detection in primary metabolism contributing considerably
to the quality improvement of metabolic models. ASBIG com—
bines the conceptual approaches of autocatalytic metabolites and
scope analysis, thereby allowing to test network reconstructions
for their integrity. For each investigated metabolic model, a min—
imal seed set of metabolites, which provides access to all funda—
mental metabolic pathways, is computed. Putative ﬂaws of the
model can be deduced directly from identiﬁed minimal seed set.

The beneﬁt of ASBIG was demonstrated by investigating
different metabolic models. In the closely examined models, nu—
merous kinds of errors could be identified including i) missing
reactions, ii) missing pathways or iii) gaps caused by insufﬁcient
knowledge of metabolic processes. Furthermore, not only single

gaps in individual models were identiﬁed, but also common ﬂaws
simultaneously present in several network reconstructions, could
be detected in a large screen of 190 network reconstructions.

In contrast to the commonly applied gap—ﬁnding approach
(i.e. deriving putative gaps from the calculated ﬂux distribu—
tions), ASBIG is a simple method and detects other types of
inconsistencies. Hence, the application of ASBIG contributes
significantly to model refinement and validation representing a
complementary approach to existing gap—ﬁnding methods.

Abstract

During the past decade, localization microscopy (LM) has transformed into an accessible, commer—
cially available technique for life sciences. However, data processing can be challenging to
the non—specialist and care is still needed to produce meaningful results. PALMsiever has been
developed to provide a user—friendly means of visualizing, filtering and analyzing LM data.
It includes drift correction, clustering, intelligent line profiles, many rendering algorithms and 3D
data visualization. It incorporates the main analysis and data processing modalities used by
experts in the field, as well as several new features we developed, and makes them broadly access—

 

ible. It can easily be extended via plugins and is provided as free of charge open—source software.

Eight years since its inception, single—molecule localization micros—
copy (LM; Betzig et (11., 2006; Rust et (11., 2006) has transformed
from a specialist technique in the hands of a few labs, to an access—
ible, commercially available technique, widely used in the life sci—
ences (Patterson et (11., 2010). Although the instrumentation
required for LM is now readily available, the data processing aspects
of the technique remain less well developed. Most recent develop—
ments in LM data processing have focused on extracting single mol—
ecule localizations from the raw data (ISBI LM Challenge 2012,
http://bigwww.epﬂ.ch/palm/), or visualization of processed data
(Baddeley et (11., 2010). However, these represent just the first and
last steps of analysis. Equally important are the post—processing
steps required to convert raw localizations to meaningful data.
Filtering out spurious localizations, grouping and tracking of mul—
tiple localizations, correcting drift, choosing the appropriate render—
ing and performing statistical analysis on the localizations are just a
few equally important aspects for which little software support
exists (Wolter et (11., 2012), leaving the non—specialist with the
unnecessary burden of developing ad [706 solutions.

PALMsiever was made publicly available in 2012 (Pengo and
Manley, 2012) to fill this void and has been under continuous devel—
opment since then (ISBI LM Challenge 2012, http://bigwww.epﬂ.ch/
palm/). While other complementary tools have since been intro—
duced (El Beheiry and Dahan, 2013; Ovesny et (11., 2014),
PALMsiever provides a single user—friendly extensible platform for
LM data processing, combining visualization, post—processing, filter—
ing and analysis features. The user interface (Fig. 1a) encourages
data exploration, by rendering the data on—the—fly, interactively re—
sponding to re—centering and zooming. Spurious localizations can be
interactively eliminated by iteratively adjusting the display ranges
for each of the available parameters, either directly by inspecting its
histogram (Fig. 1ii), or automatically by removing the lower and
upper 5% (Fig. 1a, arrow). Microscope drift during acquisition can
be corrected using the 3D drift correction plugins, either by autocor—
relation analysis or using fiducial markers. Line profiles (a simple
right—click in the image) are automatically aligned to the underlying
structure by principal components analysis and fitted to a Gaussian
function. In the presence of curvilinear structures, the included

Fig. 1. Single-molecule localization microscopy images, analyzed and ren-
dered with PALMsiever. (a) The user interface encourages exploration of the
data. The histogram (ii) of each parameter can be analyzed and automatically
trimmed to exclude the upper and lower 5% (arrow). (b) A curvilinear seg-
ment of a microtubule stained with alexa fluor 647 is traced and (c) the corres-
ponding histogram and double gaussian fit generated. (d) gag-meosZ
clusters, analyzed using a density-based clustering algorithm, which also
allows to identify potential false localizations, i.e. Noise. (e) A microtubule
section is rendered using the many rendering algorithms available. In order
from 1 to 8: scatterplot, 2D histogram, blurred 2D histogram, kernel density
estimation (a novel automatic bandwidth estimation rendering), delaunay
triangulation, jittered histogram, hue-encoded depth, a novel occluding hue-
encoded depth. (f) A 3D isosurface reconstruction of the microtubule section
microtubule presented in e

tracing tool can automatically follow the structure (Fig. 1b) and gen—
erate a fit from the projected profile (Fig. 1c). To compensate for the
presence of multiple detections of the same molecule in successive
frames, PALMsiever also includes a grouping algorithm, where de—
tections are grouped into single molecules according to spatio—tem—
poral proximity. Cluster analysis of interacting biomolecules is
enabled by a plugin for the density—based cluster analysis DBSCAN
(Endesfelder et al., 2013; Ester, 1996), which also facilitates noise
removal (Fig. 1d, showing clustering of GaG—mE0s2 data). Many
rendering methods are available such as scatterplot, 2D histogram,
blurred 2D histogram, automatic kernel density estimation (Botev,
2010), Delaunay triangulation, jittered 2D histogram, hue—encoded
depth and a novel occluding hue—encoded depth (Fig. 1e, in the same
order). Thanks to 3D data support across the software, 3D volumes
can be easily exported to a TIFF stack, visualized as a 3D isosurface
(Fig. 1f), explored using slicing, or rendered using either the classical
hue—based depth coding, or a novel rendering that correctly accounts
for overlapping structures. As an alternative, data can also be ex—
ported for visualization with ViSP (El Beheiry and Dahan, 2013).
PALMsiever has been designed with software interoperability in
mind, so a number of predefined input file formats have been pro—
vided, e.g. QuickPALM (Henriques et al., 2010), RapidSTORM
(Wolter et al., 2012), Leica SR GSD (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany), PeakSelector (courtesy of H.Hess, HHMI), uTrack
(Jaqaman et al., 2008), Vutara (Vutara, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA)
and Octane (Niu and Yu, 2008). It can also easily be extended to im—
port other file formats by adding new import filters or incorporate
new analyses by writing plugins using MATLAB, and renderings can

also conveniently be made available to the system clipboard or saved
as TIFFs for inclusion in presentations or publications. The software
is open—source and can be downloaded (together with example data—
sets) at http://code.google.com/p/palm—siever.

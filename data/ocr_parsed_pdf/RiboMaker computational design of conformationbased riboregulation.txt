ABSTRACT

Motivation: The ability to engineer control systems of gene ex-
pression is instrumental for synthetic biology. Thus, bioinformatic
methods that assist such engineering are appealing because they
can guide the sequence design and prevent costly experimental
screening. In particular, RNA is an ideal substrate to de novo design
regulators of protein expression by following sequence-to-function
models.

Results: We have implemented a novel algorithm, RiboMaker, aimed
at the computational, automated design of bacterial riboregulation.
RiboMaker reads the sequence and structure speciﬁcations, which
codify for a gene regulatory behaviour, and optimizes the sequences
of a small regulatory RNA and a 5’-untranslated region for an efficient
intermolecular interaction. To this end, it implements an evolutionary
design strategy, where random mutations are selected according to a
physicochemical model based on free energies. The resulting se-
quences can then be tested experimentally, providing a new tool for
synthetic biology, and also for investigating the riboregulation prin-
ciples in natural systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

Regulatory RNAs have been identiﬁed at the core of many cel-
lular processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Prasanth
and Spector, 2007; Waters and Storz, 2009). Among all possible
mechanisms, here we focus on regulatory RNAs that interact
with a given mRNA to control protein expression. By applying
engineering principles, we can design synthetic regulatory RNAs
to create genetic modules from which to program novel functions
in the cell (Isaacs et al., 2006). In bacteria, this can be achieved by

means of a small RNA (sRNA), whose length varies from tens to
hundreds nucleotides and which is highly structured. The sRNA
interacts with the 5/-untrans1ated region (5/-UTR) of a given
mRNA, as this region controls the ability to interact with the
ribosome (Salis et al., 2009). This control of gene expression only
relies on structural changes in the 5/-UTR, without any RNA
processing, which makes it independent of any additional cellular
machinery.

This riboregulatory mechanism allows harnessing physico-
chemical models to predict RNA interaction and function. We
take advantage of RNA folding prediction methods (Hofacker
et al., 1994; Mathews et al., 1999), as well as methods for predict-
ing RNA interactions (Busch et al., 2008; Miickstein et al., 2006),
to perform the de novo design of sRNAs and 5/-UTRs with a
base-pair energy model. Then, the designed RNA systems can be
exploited, for instance, to control metabolic pathways in biopro-
duction applications (Na et al., 2013).

In this work, we present an evolutionary method to design
nucleic acid sequences implementing riboregulatory modules.
For that, a multi-objective, combinatorial optimization algo-
rithm is implemented, where the free energies and secondary
structures of the system are considered. Importantly, fully
synthetic sequences obtained by computational design have
been already veriﬁed for functionality in vitro and in bacterial
cells (Rodrigo et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2008). In contrast to our
previous method (Rodrigo et al., 2012, 2013a), the present is not
restricted to a neutral evolution within the inverse folding of
predeﬁned RNA secondary structures (Fontana and Schuster,
1998). Therefore, the full speciﬁcation of the intramolecular
structures of the species is not essential. This dramatically
speeds up the optimization.

2 APPLICATION

RiboMaker is devised for the computational design of
conformation-based riboregulation, and in particular of bacterial
riboregulation. It designs the riboregulator (sRNA) and the tar-
geted 5/-UTR of a given mRNA (Fig. 1). Moreover, sRNAs can
be designed to activate or repress protein expression. It can also
design only one element (5/-UTR or sRNA) provided the other is
fixed. The resulting sequences can then be tested experimentally
in a living cell, provided promoter sequences. RiboMaker could
be expanded to account for the computational design of further
riboregulatory mechanisms (Rodrigo et al., 2013b).

3 METHOD

3.1 Model of bacterial riboregulation
Our model accounts for several energetic and structural terms. The ob-
jective function (Fm), to be minimized, reads

Fobj ’ AGS/UTRLsRNA ‘I‘ AG iUTRﬁ/UTR

AG5/UTR,SRNA is the free energy release after complete hybridization be-
tween the S’-UTR and the sRNA. AG5/UTR5/UTR and AGMNAMNA are the
same but for homodimer formation. AG‘gf‘i/dTmRNA is the free energy re-
lease after seed pairing, here approached by the length of the seed region
(Rodrigo et al., 2012, 2013a). AG‘gf‘i/dTRﬁ/UTR and AGﬁj’fﬁAmRM are the
same but, as before, for homodimer formation. AGgl’gL'T’g", AG:§1"{,‘,;:1““’
and AG‘gi’ng’gERNA are the works required to fold the S’-UTR, the
sRNA and the complex S’-UTR:sRNA according to the structure speci-
ﬁcations. For that, we calculate the Hamming distance between the actual
and target structures, rescaling it in terms of free energy with an empirical
parameter (Rodrigo et al., 2013a). Finally, GMNA is the free energy of the
sRNA.

In Equation (1), positive terms correspond to objectives for a positive
design strategy, whereas negatives ones correspond to objectives for a
negative design (Dirks et al., 2004). We give the same importance to
accessibility as to hybridization (Busch et al., 2008), and, for simplicity,
we do not consider weighting parameters to construct Fob]. Accordingly,
we will maximize the interaction between the S’-UTR and the sRNA,
while minimizing the two interactions to form homodimers (Rodrigo
et al., 2012). This is important to shift the equilibrium towards the ap-
propriate complex. In addition, we will minimize the structural distance
between the actual and target systems (for the S’-UTR and complex
S’-UTR:sRNA) to reach the intended regulatory behaviour.

3.2 Sequence and structure speciﬁcations

RiboMaker starts from random sequences or can read initial ones in case
the user wants to feed it. As sequence speciﬁcations, the user only needs
to detail the Shine-Dalgarno box and the start codon for the S’-UTR,
which will be kept ﬁxed during the optimization. For the sRNA, the user
can specify the sequence of the transcription terminator, although it is not
mandatory and the sRNA can be designed without. In addition, as

regulation, the sRNA activates gene expression, and (b) negative, the

of the RBS serves as a control variable

structure speciﬁcations, RiboMaker only requires the speciﬁcation of
the structure of the Shine-Dalgarno box (and neighbouring nucleotides)
in both intra- and intermolecular folding states. To compute AG‘g’i’gL'T’ﬁ"
(intramolecular speciﬁcation), the partition function is used to avoid high
ensemble defects (Zadeh et al., 2011). RiboMaker does not require the
speciﬁcation of the full intramolecular structures of all single species.

3.3 Optimization scheme

We used Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing (MCSA) as an optimization
scheme (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983). Initial sequences are iteratively
mutated, subjected to sequence constraints, towards a solution that satis-
ﬁes the speciﬁed behaviour. Single-point mutations in one strand are
applied every iteration. After that, F01?) is evaluated to decide the accept-
ance or rejection of that mutation, following a Metropolis criterion. The
MCSA temperature is continuously adjusted during the process following
an exponential cooling scheme. Accordingly, the initial temperature is
usually chosen to be high, hence moving during evolution from
random to adaptive walk. To avoid undesired sequences, a quality
check operator is applied, for instance, to avoid repeats.

3.4 Fitness landscape and convergence

The vast search space for RNA design can be explored by means of
combinatorial optimization methods (Dirks et al., 2004). For the problem
of riboregulation, Figure 2 shows the energy landscape, together with an
optimized trajectory, in terms of three signiﬁcant components of Fob),
which account for interaction and structural specifications of regulation.
There, each point represents a different sequence, and different solutions
can be reached from the same speciﬁcations.

The method can reach a good solution in few minutes (in a standard
computer with a 2GHz processor). Because all structural speciﬁcations,
intra- and intermolecular, are introduced into the objection function (fol-
lowing the penalty method), all sequences generated by mutations are
evaluated, which allows preventing traps and reaching many different
adaptive paths (103 iterations can be enough to obtain good designs for
the riboregulatory models shown in Figure 1).

3.5 Designability and limitations

Of relevance, Fob, has been shown to correlate with riboregulatory activity
in natural and synthetic systems (Mutalik et al., 2012; Rodrigo et al.,
2013a). To increase riboregulatory activity, the user can also specify cer-
tain recognition element of the RNA chaperon qu as a part of the

Fig. 3. Snapshots of the web server, where the user speciﬁes the sequence
and structure

designed sRNA (Na et al, 2013). It is expected that by starting from
random sequences, the designed ones be sufﬁciently dissimilar to others
to make cross-talk unlikely (Rodrigo et al, 2012), and, in turn, to be able
to regulate chromosomal genes too (Na et al, 2013). In addition, orthog-
onal systems could be obtained afterwards by introducing few key
mutations (Mutalik et al, 2012).

The main limitation of our approach, which is otherwise general for
RNA design, is the use of secondary structure to model RNA, which
prevents obtaining designs with pseudoknot interactions or even non-
canonical base pairing (Bida and Das, 2012). This is not critical, as it
only has the effect of restricting the space of available sequences, already
too large to explore it exhaustively. Moreover, the control over conform-
ations, although simple, is useful to obtain functional designs in bacteria
that regulate ribosome binding (Fig. 1), but it would require new
regulatory models to get designs for mammals or plants.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

4.1 Source distribution

The program is implemented in C ++ , and it has been compiled
and executed under Linux and Mac OS X environments. The
Vienna RNA package V1.8 (Hofacker et al, 1994) is used as a
library to calculate RNA secondary structures and free energies.
The program reads the design speciﬁcations from a text file and
writes the designed sequences and scoring terms into another text
ﬁle. The program can run distributed in high-performance com-
puting clusters.

4.2 Web server

The site was developed in HyperText Markup Language and
PHP HyperText Preprocessor. For creating the web structure
(header, body and footer), we used Cascading Style Sheets. To
initialize the values and check that all ﬁelds are ﬁlled, we created

a JavaScript function. The user needs to fill the ﬁelds for
sequence and structure speciﬁcations. Session variables are
employed to hold all information (sequences and structures for
all species) during a single-user session. Then, our C -l-l- program
is executed for optimization of sequences. The designed
sequences, together with the corresponding structures and free
energies, are shown on the screen (Fig. 3).

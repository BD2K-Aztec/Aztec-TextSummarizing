ABSTRACT

Summary: Intervor is a software computing a parameter-free
representation of macro—molecular interfaces, based on the a-
complex of the atoms. Given two interacting partners, possibly with
water molecules squeezed in-between them, Intervor computes
an interface model which has the following characteristics: (i) it
identifies the atoms of the partners which are in direct contact and
those whose interaction is water mediated, (ii) it defines a geometric
complex separating the partners, the Voronoi interface, whose
geometric and topological descriptions are straightforward (surface
area, number of patches, curvature), (iii) it allows the definition of the
depth of atoms at the interface, thus going beyond the traditional
dissection of an interface into a core and a rim. These features can be
used to investigate correlations between structural parameters and
key properties such as the conservation of residues, their polarity,
the water dynamics at the interface, mutagenesis data, etc.
Availability: Intervor can be run from the web site
http : / /cgal . inria. fr/abs / Intervor or upon downloading
the binary file. Plugins are also made available for VMD and Pymol.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein recognition plays a key role in the formation
of complexes which account for biological functions (Janin
et (11., 2008). The investigation of interfaces of macro—molecular
complexes is therefore central to improve our understanding of
the stability and speciﬁcity of macro—molecular interactions. In
conducting such investigations, one wishes to (i) improve the
description of experimentally resolved complexes and (ii) improve
scoring functions used to discriminate native structures among
putative ones. The goal of this note is to present an interface model
which has been used to reﬁne most of the parameters involved so
far in interface studies (Bouvier et (11., 2009; Cazals et (11., 2006),
using a unique parameter-free geometric construction.

2 THE VORONOI INTERFACE

In the following, we consider two partners A and B forming a
complex. By W, we refer to interfacial water molecules, if any.
Atoms of type A /B/ W are denoted al- /bi/wi, respectively.

Traditional interface models: Two interface models are
traditionally used: the geometric footprint based model, which
consists in considering all pairs of atoms (one on each partner) within

some distance threshold; the solvent accessible model, which selects
atoms losing solvent accessibility upon complex formation. While
the former tends to overestimate the interface size (Griinberg et (11.,
2004), the opposite holds for the latter (Cazals et (11., 2006). This
motivates our Voronoi interface model.

The Voronoi interface model—direct versus water-mediated
contacts: Consider the power diagram of the atomic balls expanded
by a water probe—abusing terminology we call it the Voronoi
diagram in the sequel. Let a restricted ball or restriction be the
intersection of this ball with its Voronoi region, see e.g. the red
ball on Figure la. Also, let an interface water molecule be a water
molecule such that its restriction has neighboring restrictions of
type A and B. Water molecules which are not at the interface are
called bulk water molecules. Our interface model consists of pairs
of restrictions of type [A;B] or [A; W] or [B; W], with W standing
for interface water molecules only. See Figure la. Note that every
such pair conveys two pieces of information: (i) the two atoms in
contact, which deﬁne an interface edge, and (ii) the Voronoi facet,
also called tile, dual of this edge.

All atoms involved in at least one pair deﬁne the interface atoms,
as illustrated on Figure lb. Tiles of type AB (AW and BW) deﬁne
the interface AB (AW and BW, respectively). Tiles of type AB deﬁne
direct contacts between the partners, while tiles of type AW and
BW deﬁne contacts between these partners which are mediated by
interface water molecules. The union of tiles AW and BW deﬁnes
the AW—BW interface. The union of the AW—BW and AB interfaces
deﬁnes the ABW interface, which separates the partners and gives a
global overview of the interaction area, regardless of the role played
by water molecules. See Figure 1c and d.

Shelling the Voronoi interface: Think of a room whose ﬂoor is
tiled, the room being delimited by walls. Assign the integer one to
all tiles in contact with a wall. Having removed these tagged tiles,
move the walls toward the tiles which were in contact with them, and
tag these with the integer two. Iterating the process until completion
results in a discrete numbering measuring the minimum distance
from a tile to the boundary of the room. This process is carried out
for the tiles of the ABW interface, starting from its boundary, the
resulting number being called the Voronoi Shelling Order or VSO
(Fig. 1d). Since an interface atom contributes at least one tile, the
V50 of this atom is deﬁned as the minimum of the values found on
the tiles contributed by this atom.

Connexions to classical interface parameters: We established that
our model identiﬁes a superset of interface atoms losing solvent
accessibility (Bahadur et (11., 2004), which actually draws the
attention to interactions between main chain atoms upon association
(Cazals et (11., 2006). Interface tiles are naturally gathered into
patches, which have been shown (Cazals et (11., 2006) to be coherent
with those obtained with classical clustering algorithms (Chakrabarti

and J anin, 2002). Quantifying the planarity of interfaces and patches
is important, e.g. to estimate (de-)solvation energies and also
to identify putative-binding regions for docking. While previous
studies have used strategies based on plane ﬁtting (Jones and
Thornton, 1996), the Voronoi interface comes with a notion of
discrete (mean) curvature (Cazals et al., 2006), which allows to
assess the curvature properties at any scale (from two tiles to the
whole interface). Finally, the V50 provides a discrete interface
depth parameterization that reﬁnes the dissection into a core and
a rim (Bahadur et al., 2004; Conte et al., 1999). In (Bouvier et al.,
2009), this parameterization allowed us to sharpen the investigation
of correlations among (i) the interface geometry, (ii) the location
of polar residues (Chakrabarti and Janin, 2002), (iii) the location of
conserved residues (Guharoy and Chakrabarti, 2005) and (iv) the
dynamics of interfacial water (Mihalek et al., 2007).

Note also that the pieces of information provided by Intervor
could be integrated within a framework such as the SCOWLP
database (Teyra et al., 2006).

3 USING Intervor

Availability: Intervor is made available from http: / / cgal .
inria.fr/abs/Intervor/. This web site allows one (i) to
run calculations, and (ii) to retrieve the binary ﬁle. In presenting
the software, we brieﬂy discuss the main options, and refer the
user either to the web site or the help provided from the command
line with the —help option. See also Bouvier et al., 2009 and
Cazals et al., 2006 to get familiar with the structural parameters
computed.

Atomic and coarse models: Intervor is written in C++, and
our code handles balls, be they atoms or pseudo-atoms. Because of
the diversity of radii sets used for pseudo-atoms, we focus in the
sequel on the atomic version.

Specifying the system: First, one needs to select which atoms deﬁne
the two partners A and B. The standard way consists of selecting
chains within a PDB ﬁle. Second, one needs to sort out the fate of
water molecules if any: one can keep them all, skip them all or ﬁlter
them on their temperature factor. Once the water molecules have
been ﬁltered, they are incorporated into the Voronoi diagram, and
the interface water molecules are identiﬁed. See Figure la.

Running Intervor and output ﬁles: To understand the
structure of the output, any Intervor execution goes through
four steps, namely: (i) interface water molecules are identiﬁed,
(ii) interface AB is explored, (iii) interface AW—BW is explored and
(iv) interfaces AB and AW—BW are merged. The output consists
of six ﬁles. The main log ﬁle provides general information; the
remaining ones provide detailed statistics on interface atoms and
the Voronoi interface. These ﬁles are detailed in the appendix of
the tech report accompanying this article (Cazals and Loriot, 2009),
available from the web site.

Visualization: Plug-ins are made available to run a calculation on a
structure and to load the result within VMD or Pymol. Visualization
facilities target atoms and the Voronoi interface. For the former,
atoms of each partner and water molecules can be visualized
independently. Each set of atoms of type A or B or W is presented in
two guises, namely with Van der Waals or expanded radii. Interfaces
AB and AW—BW can be visualized independently.

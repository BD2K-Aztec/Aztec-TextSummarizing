ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recent abundance of data from studies employing
high-throughput technologies to reveal alterations in human disease
on genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and other levels, offer the
possibility to integrate this information into a comprehensive picture
of molecular events occurring in human disease. Diversity of data
originating from these studies presents a methodological obstacle
in the integration process, also due to difficulties in choosing the
optimal unified denominator that would allow inclusion of variables
from various types of studies. We present a novel approach for
integration of such multi-origin data based on positions of genetic
alterations occurring in human diseases. Parkinson’s disease (PD)
was chosen as a model for evaluation of our methodology.
Methods: Datasets from various types of studies in PD (linkage,
genome-wide association, transcriptomic and proteomic studies)
were obtained from online repositories or were extracted from
available research papers. Subsequently, human genome assembly
was subdivided into 10kb regions, and significant signals from
aforementioned studies were arranged into their corresponding
regions according to their genomic position. For each region,
rank product values were calculated and significance values were
estimated by permuting the original dataset.

Results: Altogether, 179 regions (representing 33 contiguous
genomic regions) had significant accumulation of signals when
P-value cut-off was set at 0.0001. Identified regions with significant
accumulation of signals contained 29 plausible candidate genes for
PD. In conclusion, we present a novel approach for identification of
candidate regions and genes for various human disorders, based
on the positional integration of data across various types of omic
studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

It has been anticipated that development of highly parallel
technologies would signiﬁcantly improve our knowledge of several
unresolved issues regarding the etiology of human disease, including
details of its pathogenesis and the role of contributing risk factors.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Consequently, several attempts at discerning alterations in genomic
sequence, gene expression and protein proﬁles leading to onset of
various diseases have been performed, employing high-throughput
methodologies. However, results from these studies have still not
clariﬁed disease etiology and pathophysiology satisfactorily and
have provided a multiplicity of results that are complex to interpret
(Curtis et (11., 2005). In addition, the inherent difﬁculty of these
studies is frequent occurrence of false positive results due to multiple
testing issues, usually small numbers of samples investigated and
generally low technical and statistical reproducibility of obtained
results (Khan et al., 1999; Kim and Park, 2004).

In order to facilitate discovery of biologically signiﬁcant
genetic alterations based on such data, an integrative analysis of
publicly available datasets from studies that investigate global
alterations in human disease on different biological layers—
genome, transcriptome, proteome and phenome—is proposed.
Integrative approach is based on the assumption that genes
consistently associated with a disease on different biological layers
in different large-scale study types are likely to reﬂect biologically
relevant associations with disease investigated. In biological sense,
alterations in genomic sequence can be reﬂected in changes of gene
expression and consequently in alterations of proteomic proﬁle that
ultimately lead to observed phenotypes. The probability of a selected
gene being associated to a disease as a consequence of a noisy,
false-positive result would therefore be reduced by using integrative
approach, as it is unlikely that a same false positive gene has been
discovered simultaneously in different study types, if we assume
that there is no bias toward selecting a certain group of false positive
genes in all these studies.

Considerable difﬁculties may arise when combining different
types of biological information (Cahan et (11., 2007). Multiple
attempts at integration of such heterogeneous data have already
been reported in the literature and approaches to such prioritization
of genes have been based either on candidate genes’ functional
similarity to a set of predeﬁned training genes with known biological
role in a disease under investigation (Aerts et (11., 2006); or on
experimental data from studies investigating speciﬁc alterations in
the disease state (Rasche et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2009).

In the approach proposed by Aerts et al. (2006) and implemented
in Endeavour software, the prioritization of candidate genes was
performed by investigating their similarity to a training set of genes,
based on multiple sources of data, including various annotation,
expression, interaction, phenotype and other databases, followed by
global ranking using order statistics. Rasche et al. have applied the
integrative approach in the case of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, using

empirical data from expression proﬁling studies in human tissue
samples, mouse models and data from association studies in addition
to information extracted from annotation and literature databases.
In their approach, ﬁnal prioritization was accomplished by scoring
each gene, based on its fold change, empirical P-values, consistency
across experimental replicas of the study, while also accounting
for measure of entropy, signifying the extent of contribution of
each study to ﬁnal gene score (Rasche et (11., 2008). Sun et (11.
integrated data from four sources: GWAS, linkage, expression and
literate-based data to prioritize genes involved in schizophrenia.
Here, a custom set of weighting matrices was applied to gene
scores in order to control the contribution of each source of data in
integration (Sun et (11 ., 2009). In addition, several web-based utilities
offering the possibility of custom integrative analyses are available
for gene prioritization in various usage settings, i.e. GeneProspector,
CANDID, ToppGene, Phenopred, SUSPECTS and several others
(Tranchevent et (11., 2009).

Previous methodologies utilizing such integration approaches
were predominantly investigating which genes were overlapping
in results from different types of included studies, and were
thus utilizing gene-centric approach toward integration (Aerts
et (11., 2006; Middleton et (11., 2007; Sun et (11., 2009). Notably,
a considerable fraction of meaningful genetic alterations are
located outside genes, between adjacent genes, or spanning several
neighboring genes: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
copy number variations (CNVs), regions deﬁned by linkage
disequilibrium studies as well as epigenetic alterations (i.e.
regions with differential methylation patterns) and others. As it is
often difﬁcult to unambiguously map these genetic alterations to
appropriate genes, a choice of an efﬁcient common denominator
for the integration process might be problematic. Also, difﬁculties
due to incompatible reporting of results in publications and public
repositories from various studies may present a notable problems
not only when analyzing data from multiple study types, but
also when using data from a single type of study, if performed
on different manufacturer platforms and therefore using different
probe identiﬁers for reporting. Although tools and relation databases
enabling conversion of these identiﬁers exist, this process is often
incomplete and results in signiﬁcant loss of data.

To solve these issues, we performed a data integration based on
the genomic locations of features investigated in included studies—a
position-centric integration in contrast to previously employed gene-
centric approaches. We have previously reported an initial step in
this direction in our study on sarcoidosis, where the co-location
of genes with differential mRNA/protein expression to genomic
regions linked to sarcoidosis has been inspected (Maver et (11 ., 2009).

To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, Parkinson’s
disease (PD) has been used as a model disease for our approach.
PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder,
characterized by progressive depletion of dopaminergic neurons
within the substantia nigra, clinically manifesting as progressive
symptoms of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability
(Mayeux, 2003). It is hypothesized that idiopathic forms of PD
are a result of complex interplay between several genetic and
environmental factors. The role of genetic factors in its pathogenesis
has been substantiated through observations of heritable forms of
PD resulting from mutations in at least 12 different genes (Wider
et (11., 2010), and observation of familial aggregation of idiopathic
cases of PD in epidemiological studies (Steece-Collier et (11., 2002).

Etiology of PD remains largely unclear in most patients and to date
there are no reliable available diagnostic assays for early detection,
diagnosis and follow-up of the disease. In the recent decade, several
research groups have utilized high-throughput technologies in search
of a reliable genetic marker for PD and in effect, abundance and
availability of data studying alterations on genomic, transcriptomic
and proteomic levels exist in recent publications and publicly
available repositories.

In this study, we aim to present a novel approach to integration
of data from these studies, and perform integration-based search to
ﬁnd genomic regions and genes related to PD ethiopathogenesis.

2 METHODS

Initially, a search for studies performed in patients with PD was
performed, using Medline database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)
with search string (‘Parkinson disease’[ti] OR ‘Parkinson’s disease’[ti])
AND (transcriptom* OR proteom* OR ‘genome-wide’ OR ‘linkage scan”
OR microarray OR proﬁling). Additionally, Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) repository (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), ArrayExpress
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/a1rayexpress/) and Stanford Microarray Database
(http://smd.stanford.edu) were searched up to discover suitable sources
of data for inclusion in our initial dataset. Data from six sources was
ultimately included in the ﬁnal integration dataset: brain transcriptome,
blood transcriptome, brain proteome, genome-wide association studies
(GWAS), genome-wide linkage studies and phenomic data. For clarity, all
the included signiﬁcant results from these types of studies [SNPs associated
with PD, regions of genomic linkage disequilibrium in PD, differentially
expressed (DE) mRNA and proteins in PD] from various types of studies
included were designated as signals in all the subsequent sections.

All the data from these sources were stored and all analytical
steps were performed in R statistical environment version 2.10.0
(http://www.r-project.org/) using Bioconductor version 2.6 packages
(http://www.bioconductor.org/), unless stated otherwise.

2.1 Transcriptomic data

Raw data on transcriptomic alterations in central nervous system (CNS) and
blood samples from patients with PD was obtained from GEO repository
using the GEOquery package for R (Sean and Meltzer, 2007). Transcriptomic
alterations in CNS and blood samples were treated as two separate datasets
to account for possible differences in transcriptional alterations observed
in these two tissue samples. Three GEO datasets with accession numbers
GSE8397. GSE7621 and GSE7307 performed on CNS tissue samples
and one dataset from analyses performed on whole blood sampleiGEO
accession number GSE6613, were included. Raw datasets were examined
using arrayQualityMetrics package, followed by normalization and ﬁltering
with affyPLM and geneﬁlter packages, where necessary.

A meta-analysis of transcriptomic data was performed prior to their
inclusion of transcriptomic data in the integration process. Meta-analysis
calculations were performed using algorithms in the RankProd package in
the R environment, which enabled us to combine datasets from the three
transcriptomic studies performed on CNS samples using RPadvance function
(Hong et (11., 2006). Genes DE in a dataset from whole blood samples were
analyzed using rank product (RP) function from the same package, using
the ‘data from single origin” option. False positive rate values calculated by
RankProd for each probe set were used in further integration steps.

2.2 Proteomic data

We have inspected seven studies investigating proteomic alterations in PD
brain samples (Abdi at (11., 2006; Basso at (11., 2004; Choi et (11., 2004; Jin
et (11., 2006; Sinha at (11., 2007; 2009; Werner et (11., 2008). From each study,
proteins reaching P-Values of 5 0.05 were regarded as DE on proteomic level

and their coding genes included in our study. Altogether, 199 genes coding
for DE proteins were collected from proteomic studies.

2.3 Linkage data

Linkage data were obtained from a study by Foltynie et a1. (2005), who
performed a genome-wide linkage disequilibrium screen by genotyping 5546
microsatellite markers in pooled samples from 374 patients with PD and
two pools of 219 and 1490 control subjects without PD. Altogether, 214
microsatellite markers were found to be signiﬁcantly associated with PD,
and were included in the integration.

2.4 GWAS

Data from GWAS were obtained from Open Access Database of Genome-
wide Association Results project data (Johnson and O’Donnell, 2009), that
included complete dataset for SNPs reaching P-Values of 5 0.05 from two
GWAS in PD performed by Maraganore et a1. (2005) on Perlegen 250K
platform and Fung et a1. (2006) on Illumina Inﬁnium 100K platform. For the
integration purposes 1604 SNPs reaching P-Values of 5 0.05 were included
in our panel of signals.

2.5 Phenomic data

Additional layer of integration was introduced by implementation of data
from Phenotype ontology project (HPOP, http://www.human-phenotype-
ontology.org). This resource contains relations between genes implicated in
human monogenic disorders and phenotypic traits resulting from alterations
in these genes (Robinson et (11., 2008).

For this data source, an initial set of genes known to be related to PD was
obtained from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database
(MIM identiﬁer: 168600, McKusick, 2007). Afterwards, the phenotype
identiﬁers related to these genes were obtained from HPOP’S database. In
the second step, we have investigated which other genes were also related
to phenotypic traits of the initial gene set. This resulted in the set of genes
with phenotypic consequences similar to genes in the training set. Genes
with matching phenotypic traits were given score 1 for each phenotypic
trait, therefore genes with more phenotypic similarities to initial PD gene set
were given greater scores, enabling the prioritization according to phenotypic
similarity to genes already related to PD.

2.6 Positional integration

Positional integration was performed by mapping positive signals from every
type of study on a reference genome coordinate backbone. The coordinate
system and length of each chromosome was deﬁned according to NCBI
reference assembly Build 36.3 (March 2008) (Fig. 1).

Genes and SNPs from proteomic, phenomic and GWAS were
converted to nucleotide positions using BioMart batch mining tool
(http://www.biomart.org, Smedley at (11., 2009). Locations of probesets
from transcriptomic studies and markers from linkage study were obtained
from University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome browser site
(http://genome.ucsc.edu). Difﬁculties due to incompatible builds of reference
assemblies were resolved using liftOver tool from USCS Genome browser
(http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html).

Reference genome assembly was subdivided into 616108 regions, each
10000 bp long and with 5000 bp overlap with the neighboring region. This
overlap was introduced in order to prevent losing information of signal
aggregation at borders of deﬁned regions. We have prepared an R script that
automatically positioned signiﬁcant signals from various types of studies into
their corresponding location intervals in the genome. The result was a matrix
of 616 108 lines and six columns, each column corresponding to results from
transcriptomicibrain, transcriptomiciblood, proteomic, linkage, GWAS
and phenomic data. For each type of study, a signiﬁcant signal was noted as
the speciﬁc value of —log10p or 1 where P-Values were not available. When
multiple signals from a single type of study were located in the same region

(i.e. several neighboring SNPs), the values were summarized, to increase the
score of this region. When no signiﬁcant signal in the interval investigated
was observed, this was marked with value of 0. Values in every column were
then ordered and scored from 1 (representing the most signiﬁcant signal in
the study) to 616 108 (representing the least signiﬁcant signal in the study).
In the case of two or more regions with equal score values, the lowest rank
was used for further integration steps.

A rank statistics approach was utilized to combine the results originating
from differing sources of data. Speciﬁcally, the RP approach, described by
Breitling et a1. (2004) was implemented and RP values were calculated
according to Equation (1). In the subsequent equations, symbols used have
the following signiﬁcance: R is the consecutive number of each 10 kb
interval, 1 represent each study type used in integration, rug is the rank of
R-th interval in the vector of data from study 1 and n, signiﬁes number of all
intervals and RPR represents calculated rank product value for R-th interval.

To estimate signiﬁcance values for each region, RP values were permuted
relative to regions 1000 times and expected RP estimates were compared with
those from our original dataset, using Equation (2). Here the rank(RPperm)
signiﬁes rank of an interval in the matrix of permuted values, while the Nperm
represents number of permutation cycles used.

The possibility that greater accumulation of signals occurred in region
with greater density of genes was taken into consideration by permuting
regions containing equal numbers of genes in separate permutation blocks.
The complete set of genes required for gene density estimation was obtained
from Ensembl genome assembly version 54.

Finally, false positive pre pfp (q) values were calculated as proposed in
Breitling et a1. (2004). RPexpwed signiﬁes expected RP value of R-th interval
after permutation, rank(R) signiﬁes rank of R-th interval in the original non-
permuted dataset

rank(R)

As it is difﬁcult to predict the importance of each single dataset in ﬁnal
integration step, we attempted to calibrate optimum weighting matrix that
would be applied to datasets from included studies before the integration step.
For this approach, we obtained three lists of training genes. First was the set of
genes annotated in the KEGG database PD entry (KEGG Pathway accession
number: hsa05012, Ogata at (11., 1999), the second training set consisted
of genes implicated in the monogenic forms of PD according to OMIM
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim), and the third set was obtained
from the PDgene database (Lill at (11., 2011; http://www.pdgene.org/),
selecting only genes that contain at least one variant showing a nominally
signiﬁcant summary OR in the meta-analyses of all studies included in the
PDgene database. Each type of study was given one of the three possible
weights according to their importance in the integration process (lilower
importance, 2imedium importance and 3ihigh importance). Using three
varying weights for six datasets resulted in different variations of weight
factor matrices [(17) V36 2 36 = 729]. For each of the weight matrices applied to
original dataset signiﬁcance values were calculated using a modiﬁed equation
for weighted RP calculation and previously described permutation approach
(Equation 4). Here, W,’ signiﬁes the weight parameter assigned to study 1.

Signiﬁcance values of regions containing training genes were calculated
for each weight matrix variation. Weight matrix resulting in best performance
of regions containing training genes was chosen as the optimal arrangement
of weights for integration approach. This optimized weight conﬁguration has
been applied to our complete dataset before ﬁnal integration and the results
compared with results of non-modiﬁed dataset.

2.7 Evaluation

Evaluation was performed by searching for a direct association of genes
located in top regions selected by the integration process and PD in
the Medline database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed). The search was
performed on articles that appeared in Medline up to July 2010 using
the following search string: ‘Parkinson disease AND Gene”, where ‘Gene’
entry represented candidate genes located in the regions discovered by the
integration process. In order to also include indirect associations between
genes in top regions and PD, the Bitola data mining tool was utilized
(http://www.mf.uni-lj.si/bitola, Hristovski at (11., 2005). Bitola’s closed
discovery tool was used with the concept X set as PD (CUI:COO30567)
and concept Z was chosen from genes located in the top regions. The results
found by Bitola represent concepts that are related to X and Z at the same
time and therefore reﬂect possible, indirect, relations between concepts X
and Z, and were therefore used to study indirect relation of PD and genes
located in the top regions.

Additionally functional proﬁles of genes located in the set of top region
have been proﬁled using Gene Ontology (GO, http://www.geneontology.org,
Ashburner at (11., 2000), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG,
http://www.genome.jp/kegg/, Ogata at (11., 1999) and Reactome (http://www
.reactome.org, Joshi-Tope at (11., 2005) pathway analysis. Hypergeometric
test implemented in GOstats for R (available from http://www.bioconductor
.org, Falcon and Gentleman, 2007) package has been utilized for this purpose.
A complete set of genes obtained from Ensembl database (http://www
.ensembl.org) was set as the gene universe. P-Values for over-representation
of functional terms were adjusted according to BenjaminiiHochberg
method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Reactome Skypainter utility
(http://www.reactome.org/cgi-bin/skypainter2) was used to determine
overrepresentation of pathways/reactions in the ﬁnal set of genes.

For comparison with other utilities available for gene prioritization,
we performed analyses using Endeavour software (available at:
http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bioiuser/endeavour/indexphp, Aerts at (11.,
2006) and ToppGene software (available at: http://toppgene.cchmc.org/,
Chen et (11., 2009). For Endeavour, a method for genome-wide scoring was
selected in the Java server-based version of the software and a list of 12 PD-
related genes were selected from OMIM database as a training set. All the
available sources offered by Endeavour were selected for gene prioritization
and other parameters were left in their default state. Similarly, for ToppGene
software, a list of 12 OMIM PD-related genes were selected as a training set,
complete set of Ensembl genes were selected for prediction and all available
sources were included in the similarity analyses.

samples, 1731 DE genes obtained by analyzing raw data from a
transcriptional study performed on whole blood samples, 199 DE
proteins from 7 proteomic studies, 214 regions from a linkage study
in PD, 1604 SNPs from GWAS and 1253 genes with phenotypic
relationship to PD.

Initially, the distribution of signals in the genome was
examined. Of the complete set of 616 108 genomic regions
investigated in the integration, 476810 (77.4%) did not contain
any signals from included studies, 121 011 (19.6%) contained
signal originating from one study type, 16214 (2.6%) contained
signals originating from two different study types, 1969 (0.32%)
contained signals from three types of studies, 103 (0.017%) regions
contained signals from four study types and 1 (0.00016%) region
exhibited aggregation of signals from ﬁve types of studies.
Aggregation of signals from all six study types was not observed in
any of the regions investigated. Of the top 10 kb regions with greatest
accumulation of signals (those containing signals originating from
at least four different types of studies), most were located on
chromosomes 17 (18 regions), 9 (17 regions), 15 (14 regions), 18
(9 regions) and chromosomes 4 and X, each containing 7 regions.
Among these, several regions were found to be adjacent to form
regional blocks >10 kb, resulting from aggregation of signals in
contiguous blocks of neighboring 10 kb intervals. After these pairs
of adjoining regions were merged into one, there were altogether 33
contiguous genomic regions with aggregation of signals from more
than four types of studies.

Before performing rank product statistics calculations, the optimal
weight conﬁguration was estimated for each type of study included
(Fig. 2). When KEGG genes were used as a training set, the greatest
performance was obtained when transcriptome brain, proteome and
phenome layers were given higher weights and transcriptome blood
and GWAS study types were given lower weights. When genes
implicated in monogenic forms of PD and genes signiﬁcant in meta-
analyses of PD association studies were used to train best weights,
optimal results were obtained with phenome layer given higher
weights and other layers were given neutral or lower weights. For
further analyses, optimal weight conﬁguration based on the training
set of KEGG pathway genes was used.

After selection of KEGG pathway-based weighting matrix,
signiﬁcance values for each interval were estimated by calculation
of weighted RP values and performing 1000 permutations. Genome-
wide distribution of obtained signiﬁcance values is presented in

Figure 3. Altogether, 179 (0.029%) regions attained signiﬁcance
values 30.0001, comprising 33 discrete regional blocks after
neighboring intervals were merged. Altogether, these regions
contained 29 Ensembl genes. Peaks of highest signiﬁcance were
observed UCHLl and SNCA gene regions on chromosome 4, GFAP
gene region on chromosome 17, APOE gene region on chromosome
19, in addition to novel regions on chromosomes 7, 11 and 20.
When applying a less restrictive cutoff of P-values f 0.05, altogether
23 647 (3.84%) regions reached signiﬁcance. This accounted for
2748 contiguous regions, containing 2183 genes. Calculation of
pfp (q) values revealed 10 regions attaining pfp values <0.05,
containing 14 genes.

Among the regions with best signiﬁcance scores, several
contained genes with already established role in PD through
association studies or genes that have been implicated in genetic
forms of PD, such as SNCA and UCHLl. For demonstration, the
detailed view of supporting evidence for inclusion of SNCA gene
region is presented in Figure 4a.

On the other hand, several novel genetic candidates were revealed
after inspecting the list of top regions. For presentation, YWHAE
gene was selected, being located in one of the top regions,

and supported by evidence from at least four originating omic
studies. The supporting inclusion evidence for YWHAE gene
region is presented in Figure 4b. Further exploration of data and
inspection of interpositions of results from source studies may
be performed on our project’s web site, which is available at
http://integratomics.dyndns-remote.com/index.php.

3.1 Evaluation

Search for direct associations of genes in regions with highest
signiﬁcance values (P 30.0001) with PD has uncovered that of 29
genes located in these regions, 15 genes were previously directly
associated with PD (51.7%), of which 7 genes were co-occuring
with PD in at least 10 Medline entries (MAPT, BAX, APOE, GFAP,
SNCA, PRNP and UCHL1).

Search for the indirect associations using the Bitola software
has revealed that several remaining novel genes were related to
PD indirectly: 11 genes through their role in neurodegeneration
processes, 3 genes through their role in regulation of neuronal
function, 1 gene through involvement in regulation of apoptosis in
neuronal cells and 4 genes through their association with various
other disorders of CNS.

A selection of overrepresented GO terms associated with the set of
genes located in top integratomic regions are presented in Figure 5
(presented are terms with hypergeometric test P-values < 0.01). The
largest proportion of genes from integration was associated with G0
terms related to speciﬁc neuronal terms (most prominently, axonal
function), metabolism of small molecules, lipid/sterol metabolism
and apoptosis. It has also been inspected whether genes in regions
with evidence originating from greater number of different study
types would result in enrichment of terms related to PD. It can be
noted in Figure 5 that with progressive inclusion of more study types,
a greater proportion of genes in the resulting set were related to GO
annotations generally associated with PD: mitochondrial function,
lipid/cholesterol metabolism, metabolism of small molecules and
neural development.

The Reactome enrichment analysis has revealed that resulting set
of genes are involved in pathways of Membrane trafﬁcking (P:
0.011), Lipid digestion, mobilization and transport ( =0.0024) and
Synaptic transmission (P = 0.044).

Calculations in Endeavour software using 12 training genes from
OMIM database have shown 111 new genes to have prioritization
P-values < 0.0001 . We compared the list of top 1000 genes provided
by Endeavour and list of top 1000 genes in highest ranked regions
obtained by our integrative approach. Overall, both lists of top-
ranked genes shared 176 (17.6%) genes (hypergeometric test P-
value < 1 X 10_16). Analysis with ToppGene gene prioritization
suite has ranked 199 genes with similarity P-values < 0.0001. Even
higher concordance between top 1000 list of genes from ToppGene
and our approach was observed (overall 225 genes matching in both
lists, hypergeometric test P-value for enrichment < 1 X 10“”). The
coherence of genes selected by Endeavour and ToppGene and genes
located in regions prioritized by our approach may be observed in
Supplementary Figure 1.

the integration of data-originating studies that investigated global
alterations in PD on different biological layers. From large-
scale studies in PD, 179 regions were selected by demonstrating
signiﬁcantly increased aggregation of signals across at least four
different biological layers of data from large-scale studies in PD.
Recent technological advances have enabled identiﬁcation of
molecular alterations occurring in human diseases on a global
scale. However, these approaches are intrinsically burdened by
the high dimensionality of data leading to multiple testing issues,
usually small numbers of samples investigated and generally low
technical and statistical reproducibility of obtained results (Khan
et (11., 1999; Kim and Park, 2004). We therefore hypothesized
that an integrated approach, involving several layers of biological
information interconnected by ﬂow of information deﬁned by central
dogma of molecular biology could provide additional insight into
events occurring in complex diseases. It is not uncommon that
intermediate and minor alterations found in various large-scale
studies are disregarded in further studies as they are interpreted
as non-speciﬁc noise in the data. However, a proportion of

these alterations could nevertheless represent biologically relevant
information. Consistent observation of such alterations in various
types of large-scale studies may suggest a biologically important
signal, although they may only reach intermediate or minor
signiﬁcance levels in separate studies. Therefore, this additional
level of complexity may provide a more complete insight into
disease pathogenesis and assist in searching for optimal disease
biomarkers for PD and other complex disorders.

Integration of data from various sources has previously been
employed to select for genes with consistently highest signiﬁcance
scores from various different studies (Aerts et (11., 2006; Sun
et (11., 2009). Previous integration studies have utilized gene-
centric approaches, combining information from various types of
studies using gene names or accessions as a common denominator.
However, several issues may arise when using gene-centric approach
to integration of multi-sourced data.

First, difﬁculties may arise due to inconsistencies in gene
annotation used for reporting of results in various types of large-scale
studies. Results of these studies are often provided using differing

annotations for reporting signiﬁcant outcomes, i.e. using microarray
probe identiﬁers, gene symbols, gene names and other annotations.
Conversion of these annotations to a common gene identiﬁer is often
imperfect. This issue has been well recognized previously in meta-
analyses of microarray expression data (Cahan et (11., 2007). In our
preliminary assessment of input data, we have found that 306 (7.5%)
of Affymetrix probe identiﬁers showing signiﬁcant gene expression
differences in brain of patients with PD could not be converted to
HGNC (Human Gene Nomenclature Committee) gene annotations
using the BioMart utility (http://www.biomart.org/). Even greater
difﬁculties were encountered in conversion of identiﬁers for
signiﬁcantly associated with PD to HGNC gene names, where
only 50.6% of SNP identiﬁers could be converted to HGNC gene
names. It is expected that with inclusion of greater number of
studies differing by design, an increasing proportion of meaningful
information is lost in the integration process due to these annotation
disparities.

Second, it is well established that genetic changes located outside
gene’s coding region may contribute to disease susceptibility.
Various forms of genetic changes are located in adjacent gene
regulatory regions several kilobases upstream or downstream and
inﬂuence gene expression and/or ﬁinction (Kleinjan and van
Heyningen, 2005). These long range effects have been shown extend
to 1 Mb in either direction from the gene and may reside in regions
occupied by other genes (Kimura-Yoshida et (11., 2004; Kleinjan
et (11., 2001). Such long-range interactions would be overlooked
in gene-centric integrations approaches, i.e. a SNP located farther
upstream from a gene would not be associated with a DE gene, and
thus this interaction would be omitted from further analyses. As the
role of these interactions may be an important layer of complexity in
multifactorial diseases, this is a signiﬁcant issue in the gene-centric
integration approaches (Steidl et (11., 2007).

To address these and other issues occurring in integrative
approaches, we based the integration of data from various types
of studies on positions of genetic changes associated with PD.
Difﬁculties due to poor conversion of annotations were resolved
by converting annotations to their positions on genome coordinates.
Where direct conversion was not available, we have used BLAST
services to ﬁnd corresponding genomic positions of feature, based
on sequences of probes by microarray manufacturers. Also, this
approach takes into account interactions between nearby genetic
changes and is not limited by types of genetic changes to be included
in the integration process, being ﬂexible enough to allow inclusion of
anticipated data from studies investigating epigenetic modiﬁcations,
CNV, microRNA alterations in human disease. Since it would be
statistically problematic to directly merge signiﬁcance values from
studies reporting alterations in PD on different biological layers,
especially due to signiﬁcant differences in methodological and
statistical designs, we have used a prioritization approach to select
best regions that contained most signiﬁcant values on the greatest
number of biological layers included. To evaluate genes in regions
singled-out by integration process, we investigated existent literature
for direct and indirect associations of these genes with PD. We have
found that integration process revealed genes from which a notable
proportion was previously studied in relation with PD (51.7%). Of
these several are previously well-investigated PD genes, found to
have a role in monogenic forms of PD, such as UCHL1 and SNCA.

On the other hand, several genes located in top regions have not
previously been investigated in PD. A large fraction of remaining

genes could be indirectly associated with PD with further data-
mining approaches. As an example, YWHAE gene, presented in
the results section, has been indirectly associated with PD in
only one study, according to the Medline database (using search
string ‘Parkinson’s disease AND YWHAE’), while multiple lines of
evidence from large-scale studies suggests its role in PD (altered
mRNA expression in brain, altered protein levels in samples
from PD, location in region linked to PD in genomic scans and
phenotypic compatibility with PD). According to data from GO, it is
involved in the processes of neuronal migration, CNS development,
intracellular signaling and regulation of apoptosis, which ﬁts our
current View of PD pathogenesis (Gandhi and Wood, 2005). In
addition, it has recently been found to potentially interact with
Parkin protein, an ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), mutations of which
cause juvenile onset—autosomal recessive PD (Davison et (11.,
2009).

Other genes located in the top regions have functional proﬁles
compatible with PD pathogenetic processes, and belong to GO
categories of nerve—nerve synaptic transmission, mitochondrion
transport along microtubule, CNS development, arnyloid precursor
protein metabolic process, myelination among others and are
therefore feasible genes to include in the further studies of PD
pathogenesis.

It is necessary to point out that possible difﬁculties are inherent
to position-centric integration approach. Choice of sizes of regions
used for integration is not straightforward and by choosing regions
too small, may result in missing important long-range interactions,
while choosing to large regions may result in high amount of false
positive genes. We chose to study regions 10 kb in size, as this
reduced a number of genes observed to an average of 0.5 gene per
each region; therefore, easing the process of supervised selection
of the genes where this aggregation occurs in the selected region.
On the other hand, possibility of missing interactions occurring at
lengths farther than 10 kb exists in this case.

As noted in Section 1, several types of general purpose software
are available that enable performing integrative gene prioritization
and calculate ranking of candidate genes based on similarities to
a predeﬁned training set of genes instead of using disease-speciﬁc
experimental results. For comparison, we investigated coherence
of output from available tools with the results of our integrative
analysis. Notably, we performed analyses using Endeavour and
ToppGene software, selecting OMIM genes related to monogenic
forms of PD as an initial training set. While a notable proportion of
genes obtained by these gene prioritization approaches calculation
were compatible with our list of top genes (list of top 1000 genes
obtained by our approach and that obtained by Endeavour or
ToppGene software shared 17.6 and 22.5% of genes, respectively),
there are also differences between our and Endeavour/ToppGene
ranked lists (Supplementary Fig. 1). This divergence is primarily
a consequence of inclusion of different sources of data—our
results were based on disease-speciﬁc experimental data and
Endeavour/ToppGene prioritization is based on annotational and
functional similarities to the training set of genes. Also, Endeavour
and similar approaches base prioritization on a smaller set of genes
with known relation to a disease under investigation, potentially
conferring some limitation to discovery of entirely new causative
genes and disease mechanisms. It is our view that results from
both approaches should be viewed as complementary utilities in
integrative gene prioritization.

5 CONCLUSONS

A novel integrative approach to selection of candidate regions and
genes involved in human disease is presented. In contrast to previous
methodologies employed for integration, this approach is based
on genomic positions of alterations in human disease (position-
centric), circumventing several issues met in previous gene-centric
integrative studies.

Here, this approach was used for discovery of putative regions
and genes related to PD, using a comprehensive and unique set
of data sources (GWAS, linkage studies, expression studies and
proteomic studies). Of note is an additional source of phenomic
information, obtained by inclusion of data from HPOP and utilizing
the information on phenotypic changes in monogenic disorders in
searching of genes for complex disorders.

In the near future, we expect the availability of data on PD to
grow further. This new information will be straightforwardly added
to our current dataset and further improve comprehensiveness of
the search for putative genomic regions and genes related to PD.
While we have demonstrated the use of this approach in PD, large
availability of data reported for other common diseases enables
application of our strategy to other complex diseases or genetic
diseases with undetermined genetic causes.

The data from analysis in our study are accessible for further
exploration and inspection of content of ranked regions on the
web address: http://integratomics.dyndns-remote.com/index.php.
As further sources of experimental data are added to the initial set
of studies, the prioritization of regions will be updated accordingly
and the results accessible on this site.

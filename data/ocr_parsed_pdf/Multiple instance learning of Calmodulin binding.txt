ABSTRACT

Motivation: Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitously conserved protein
that acts as a calcium sensor, and interacts with a large number of
proteins. Detection of CaM binding proteins and their interaction sites
experimentally requires a significant effort, so accurate methods for
their prediction are important.

Results: We present a novel algorithm (Ml-1 SVM) for binding
site prediction and evaluate its performance on a set of CaM-
binding proteins extracted from the Calmodulin Target Database. Our
approach directly models the problem of binding site prediction as a
large-margin classification problem, and is able to take into account
uncertainty in binding site location. We show that the proposed
algorithm performs better than the standard SVM formulation, and
illustrate its ability to recover known CaM binding motifs. A highly
accurate cascaded classification approach using the proposed
binding site prediction method to predict CaM binding proteins in
Arabidopsis thaliana is also presented.

Availability: Matlab code for training Ml-1 SVM and the cascaded
classification approach is available on request.

1 INTRODUCTION

Calmodulin (CaM) is an intracellular calcium sensor protein that
interacts with a large number of proteins to regulate their biological
functions and exhibits sequence conservation across all eukaryotes
(Bouche e1 (11., 2005). Ca2+ plays a very important role in many
cellular functions ranging from fertilization and cellular division to
neuronal spiking (Reddy e1 (11., 2011). Due to the importance of
calcium signaling in cells, identifying proteins that bind CaM and
determining the location of the CaM binding site in them can help
in gaining a better understanding of cellular function in general, and
the role of calcium in different cellular processes in particular. This
article presents a highly accurate computational approach that can
identify the location of a CaM binding site in a protein solely on the
basis of its amino acid sequence, helping avoid the signiﬁcant effort
of performing such experiments in the lab (Reddy e1 (11., 2011).
Our approach uses sequence information alone, which ensures its
wider applicability in comparison to methods that rely on structural
modeling (Zhou and Qin, 2007).

CaM binding sites are known to be contiguous in sequence,
often occurring through an amphiphilic alpha helix (O’Neil and
DeGrado, 1990). This makes CaM binding site prediction amenable
to a sliding-window classiﬁcation approach, as applied in recent
work (Radivojac e1 (11., 2006; Hamilton e1 (11., 2011). The method
by Radivojac e1 (11. uses a hierarchical neural network classiﬁer
trained on the basis of amino acid properties averaged over a ﬁxed-
size window. Hamilton e1 (11. showed that a simple sliding window

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on average amino acid
composition achieves similar performance.

In this article, we present a novel formulation of the binding
site prediction problem that is based on the framework of multiple
instance learning (MIL; Dietterich e1 (11., 1997). In MIL positive
examples come in bags. For a positive bag, it is assumed that at least
one of the examples is indeed positive whereas negative bags contain
only negative examples. We use this for binding site prediction by
forming a positive bag out of ﬁxed-size sequence windows that
overlap the annotated binding site. This allows us to model the
uncertainty in actual binding site location—experimental methods
may not precisely locate a binding site, and may include a region that
is larger than the true binding site due to limitations of budget and
experimental procedures. Furthermore, modeling binding sites this
way facilitates the use of sequence representations that are position
dependent, yielding a more detailed model of the binding site. This
allows learning of motifs that are characteristic of the binding site.

MIL has been applied in a variety of other problem domains
such as object tracking (Babenko e1 (11., 2011), protein identiﬁcation
(Tao e1 (11., 2004), and prediction of protein—ligand binding afﬁnities
(Teramoto and Kashima, 2010).

Our results show that the proposed MI-1 SVM has higher accuracy
than the classical multiple instance SVM (Andrews et (11., 2003),
and is also faster to train. MI-1 also performs better than a standard
SVM, thereby improving on existing work of (Radivojac e1 (11., 2006;
Hamilton e1 (11., 201 1). We also compare the merits of several ways of
representing binding sites, and demonstrate the ability of our method
to learn motifs that are associated with CaM binding. Finally, we
show how the resulting binding site predictor can be used as the basis
for a classiﬁer that predicts CaM binding proteins, with improved
accuracy over earlier work.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets and pre-processing

The dataset for CaM binding site prediction and its pre-processing follows
(Radivojac et (11., 2006). A set of 210 proteins was obtained from the
Calmodulin Target database (Yap et (11., 2000). Each of these proteins bind
CaM, and one or more binding sites within each protein are annotated. A
non-redundant subset of 153 proteins containing 185 binding sites was then
chosen such that no two proteins have more than 40% sequence identity and
no two binding sites are more than 50% identical.

Sequence windows of length 21, the average length of CaM binding sites,
were extracted from the protein sequences to create positive and negative
examples. Negative examples were created by sliding a length 21 window
in 10 amino acid increments such that no part of the window overlaps an
annotated binding site. Positive examples, on the other hand, were created
by sliding a length 21 window over an annotated binding site in increments
of 1 amino acid. Thus, the number of positive examples from an annotated
binding site equals the number of amino acids in the binding site.

For CaM binding prediction, we used a dataset of 236 proteins
experimentally determined to bind CaM using a protein array screen that

tested around a thousand proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana (Popescu, 2007).
The remaining 27,140 proteins in the Athaliana proteome were used as
negative examples (non-binders).

2.2 Vanilla SVM

As a baseline method we have used a standard binary SVM (Cortes and
Vapnik, 1995). Our labeled dataset consists of N labeled examples (xi,yi)
where X, is the sequence of a window, and ye {+1, —1} is its associated label
indicating whether the central residue of xi lies in a binding site or not.

The large-margin learning problem can be formulated as:

. 1 T N
mmwgpfzoiw w+Czl:§i. (1)
1:
subject to: yi(wT¢(xi)+p) Z 1 —§,»,Vi.

Here ¢(x,») is the feature representation of the window X, and the cost
parameter C controls the trade-off between constraint Violation and margin
maximization. The discriminant function f (xi) =WT¢ (xi)+p can then be
used to predict whether a given window is part of a binding site or not. The
location of a binding site is predicted by the window that offers the highest
value of the discriminant function for that protein (Hamilton 21 (11., 2011).
PyML (Ben-Hur, PyMLimachine learning in Python, 2011) was used for
the implementation.

2.3 Multiple instance learning SVM

In MIL [both multiple instance learning SVM (mi-SVM) and MI-1-SVM],
the positive examples from each binding site are grouped into a single bag.
We denote the set of positive examples for a given binding site b as P(b)
and the set of negative examples from the protein to which the binding site 1)
belongs as N The mi-SVM approach is formulated as follows (Andrews
et (11., 2003):

1 C N

1 1 T

mmYd-l,+llN<wE1§n>0§W W+ﬁz13§i>
1:

subject to: y,(wT¢(x,)+ p) z 1 —§,,Vi. (2)

» 1
Z y’T+:1, Vb
ieP(b)

y,» = —1, Vi eN(b),Vb.
In this formulation y, 6 {+1, —1} acts as a label for the window xi, and the
objective is to ﬁnd the optimal labeling of the examples that comprise the
positive bags such that at least one example in each positive bag is labeled as

positive 2 (y, + 1) / 2 Z 1 . The other constraints ensure correct labeling
ieP(b)

of the given training examples and that all negative examples are labeled
as negative examples. In case of the binding site prediction problem, this
means that a trained mi-SVM will choose at least one positive window from
the set of positive windows in a binding site. The mi-SVM formulation
is a combinatorial optimization problem. We use the heuristic algorithm
proposed by (Andrews et (11., 2003) to solve this problem. The algorithm
initially assigns the label of a bag to all examples in it, i.e. all examples in
positive bags are assigned a label of +1 whereas all negative examples
are assigned —1. It uses these assigned labels to solve a regular SVM
learning problem [as in Equation (1)]. Labels for all examples in positive
bags are then imputed based upon the sign of their discriminant function
value. If no example in a positive bag is assigned a positive label (i.e. the
constraint 2 (y, + 1) / 2 Z 1 is violated), the algorithm picks the example

ieP(b)

in the bag having the largest discriminant function value and sets its label
to +1. The algorithm then alternates between label imputation and SVM
training until the labels stop changing. This simple algorithm has shown
good performance in comparison to more complicated ones (Andrews et (11.,
2003).

Fig. 1. CaM binding site prediction with MIL. The annotated binding site
is shown as a box, and is represented by a ‘bag’ composed of the windows
indicated in red above the binding site. The rest of the windows that do
not overlap the binding site are negative examples (shown in blue below
the protein). The bottom panel illustrates the desired characteristics of the
classiﬁer’s discriminant function. The dots indicate the score of different
examples (positive indicated by solid red circles and negative shown as
hollowed blue circles). The score from the trained discriminant function for
one window in a binding site should be higher than the scores generated for
non-binding site windows within that protein

2.4 Novel MI SVM formulation (MI-1 SVM)

Accurate prediction of the location of a binding site in a protein requires a
less stringent condition than the one used in mi-SVM: at least one window
in the true binding site needs to score higher than the negative windows
from the same protein (Fig. 1). This allows us to signiﬁcantly reduce the
complexity of the learning problem in comparison to mi-SVM. The mi-
SVM and vanilla SVM formulations try to classify windows as binding or
non-binding without modeling the concept that these windows in fact lie
within a protein. Our proposed MI-1 SVM formulation, on the other hand,
operates at the protein level. The large-margin formulation of this learning
problem, can be expressed as follows:

. 1 C
mmwggzo EwTw+ M zigéb.

such that Vb (3)

mammary) WT¢(X1) Z WT¢(Xj)+1-§wajE N (b),

where M is the total number of binding sites in the training data. For
a given binding site, this formulation tries to maximize the difference
between the discriminant function values of the maximum scoring window
within the binding site and the non-binding windows in the rest of the
protein containing that binding site. Since MI-1 SVM simply compares the
discriminant function scores in the binding and non-binding site windows in
its constraints, it does not require a bias term. Moreover, the number of slack
variables (Eb) in MI-1 SVM is equal to the number of binding sites and not
the number of training examples, as in the vanilla SVM and the mi-SVM. As
a consequence, the number of variables involved in the optimization in MI-1
SVM is much smaller than that in mi-SVM and this leads to faster training.
Using the same S}, for a single binding site effectively takes the maximum
of the scores over all non-binding site windows of the protein to which 1)
belongs. Another important feature of MI-1 SVM is that, like the ranking
SVM discussed in (Joachims, 2006), MI-1 SVM also explicitly maximizes
the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

Similar to mi-SVM, which performs optimization over the labels of
examples in positive bags, MI-1 SVM is also a combinatorial optimization
problem because of the maximum operation in its constraints. We have used
the heuristic algorithm given in Table 1 to obtain a solution to this problem.
The algorithm can be stopped when the representative examples of all binding
sites stop changing, or on the basis of a user-deﬁned maximum number of
iterations. In all our experiments, the algorithm converged in 10 iterations
or less. A trained MI-1 SVM can be used to produce discriminant function
scores for any given residue in a protein.

The QP problem in the MI-1 algorithm can be solved in the primal or in
the dual. The primal formulation of the problem (3) is more efﬁcient than the
dual when the dimensionality of the feature vector is smaller than the number
of training examples. The dual formulation of the QP problem (based upon
the Lagrange of the primal) is given by:

mind % Z Z af(AfTAJI-’)cx;’— Z (le’

such that V1): (4)

Here 0111’ is the Lagrange variable corresponding to the primal constraint
WT¢ (xb) Z WT¢ (xi) + 1 — S1, and A}? =¢ (xb) — ¢ (xi). The dual formulation
reveals some interesting aspects of the MI-1 SVM. It shows that Lagrange
variables (01) only exist for negative examples, and that the sum of all 01 for
negative examples from a single protein is constrained to be less than or equal
to C /M . This differs from a conventional SVM formulation which requires
that each of the 01, on its own, should be 5 C / M and the sum of products of
01 from all training examples with their corresponding labels should be zero.
Thus, the MI-1 SVM formulation is less constrained than a conventional
SVM formulation and this can potentially lead to a better solution.

2.5 CaM binding prediction

In this article, we compare the following two strategies for CaM binding
prediction.

2.5.1 Discriminant function scoring The maximum discriminant function
score across all windows in a protein can be used as the CaM binding
propensity of that protein. This approach was used in (Hamilton et al.,
2011) to predict CaM binding of proteins in the A.thaliana proteome. In
their method, the scores were generated using a standard SVM classiﬁer
trained for binding site prediction. In this article, we use the scores from
MI-1 SVM instead.

2.5.2 Cascadea1 classiﬁcation We implemented a two-stage cascaded
classiﬁcation approach for CaM binding prediction. In the ﬁrst stage, the
window in a given protein with the highest MI-1 SVM discriminant function
score is chosen as the most likely binding site window for that protein. This
is done for all proteins in the training set. In the second stage, a standard
SVM is trained to discriminate between the most likely binding site windows
in positive examples (known CaM-binding proteins) and negative examples
(non-CaM-binding proteins). Once the second stage SVM has been trained,
the binding propensity of a test protein can be estimated by ﬁrst ﬁnding
its most likely binding site window using MI-1 SVM, and then evaluating
the discriminant function value of the second stage SVM for the chosen
window. A Gaussian kernel was used in the second stage SVM as it performed
signiﬁcantly better than a linear kernel. However, the use of non-linear
kernels in MI-1 SVM did not seem to improve performance.

2.6 Feature representations

The performance of the learning methods described above for binding
site and CaM binding prediction was analyzed using a number of feature
representations which are presented next.

2.6.1 p-Spectrum The p-spectrum ¢(x) of a string over an alphabet Z is
a vector each of whose components ¢V(x) are the number of occurrences of
each length-p substring v in the string x. The p-spectrum kernel between two
strings is given by the corresponding Euclidean dot product (Leslie et al.,
2002)

2.6.2 Position-dependentp-spectrum The position-dependentp-spectrum
¢(x) of a string x is a vector of indicator variables ¢(V,k)(x) each showing
whether the length-p substring v occurs at position k in the string x. The
resulting position-dependent p-spectrum kernel is given by: KPD (x,x’)=
¢(x)T¢ (x’ The position-dependent kernel takes the relative position of an
amino acid in a window into account whereas the p-spectrum kernel does not.

2.6.3 Position-dependent gappy triplet This feature representation
quantiﬁes the occurrences of motifs of the form ax’”bx”c, where a, b, c are
amino acids and x’" indicates m don’t-care positions. For a given string x,
the feature vector ¢’”’”(x) of the position-dependent gappy triplet comprises
of variables c,k)(x) which indicate whether the motif ax’"bx”c starts at
position k in the string or not. The kernel K”"” (x,x’) =¢”"”(x)T¢”"” (x’)
between two strings tells us the number of locations in the two strings
that have the same motif starting at them. We have used multiple position-
dependent gappy triplet kernels as K PDGT (x,x’ ) = i i K”"” (x,x’ This

11:20 n:0
kernel allows us to extract meaningful information about motifs for CaM

binding sites and is only used for binding site prediction for this purpose.
We perform normalization of any kernel representation using the cosine

X,X x ,x

2.7 Evaluation methodology

We use Leave-One-Protein-Out (LOPO) cross-validation in order
to analyze the performance for binding site prediction. In LOPO,
all examples (positive or negative) from a single protein are held-
out while the classiﬁer is trained on the remaining proteins. The
classiﬁer is then evaluated over the examples from the held out
protein. We evaluate the following performance metrics and use their
average across all proteins to make comparisons between methods
and kernels:

(a) Protein level area under the ROC curve (AUC): The area
(expressed as percentage) under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve (the plot of true positive rate

versus false positive rate) obtained for windows in a given
protein.

(b) Protein level area under ROC 10% curve (AUC0.1): The area
(expressed as percentage) under the ROC curve based on up
to the ﬁrst 10% false positives in a protein.

(c) False-Hit ratio (FH-measure): The percentage of non-binding
site windows (out of the total number of non-binding site
windows) that have a score higher than the maximum scoring
window in the known binding site. This measure tells us how
many non-binding site windows are expected with a score
higher than the true binding site window.

(d) True-Hit probability (TH-measure): For a given protein, a true
hit is deﬁned to occur when the residue at the center of the
highest scoring window for that protein lies within a binding
site. The average number of true hits across all proteins (called
the TH-measure) represents the probability of the maximum
scoring window predicted by a classiﬁer to lie within a true
binding site.

The AUC is a measure of how good a particular method is in
ranking binding site windows above non-binding sites. AUC0.1
gives us a sense of how good are the top scoring windows produced
by a classiﬁer. The FH measure represents the chances of a non-
binding site window to be ranked higher than a true binding
site window. The TH-measure tells us about the chances of the
highest scoring window predicted by a classiﬁer to belong to a true
binding site. Both the TH and the FH measures provide meaningful
information about the accuracy of the method to a biologist who
intends to use the proposed prediction scheme to verify potential
binding site locations experimentally.

We use AUC as the performance metric for CaM binding
prediction. AUC can be directly computed from the estimated
CaM binding propensities when using the Discriminant ﬁinction
scoring approach. With the Cascaded classiﬁcation approach, AUC
is obtained from 5-fold stratiﬁed cross-validation with nested grid
search for model selection. In cross-validation, it was ascertained
that two proteins with more than 40% sequence similarity are in the
same fold (evaluated using BLASTCLUST from the NCBI BLAST
package (Altschul et (11., 1990)). Moreover, the data for CaM binding
prediction inA.th(11i(1n(1 did not include any proteins which were part
of the MI-1 training set.

2.8 Model selection

In order to perform model selection (the choice of the cost parameter
C) for the vanilla and MI-1 SVM formulations for binding site
prediction, we used nested 5-fold cross-validation within each
iteration of LOPO cross-validation. The TH-measure obtained from
the 5-fold cross-validation is then used to choose the value of C for
that iteration of LOPO. The values of C that were used in the nested
cross-validation are {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100}.

As mi-SVM takes a long time to train, nested cross-validation
could not be performed. Instead we evaluated the LOPO cross-
validation performance (TH-measure) of mi-SVM with different
values of C in {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100} and the best results with
the optimal value of C = 10 are reported. This method for selection
of C for mi-SVM can potentially lead to over optimistic performance

estimates. This is not an issue, since our claim is that the proposed
approach performs better.

In the case of CaM binding prediction in A.th(11i(1n(1 using
cascaded classiﬁcation, we performed a nested (5-fold) grid search
within each cross-validation fold for selecting the parameter values
of the second-stage SVM. Values of C in the SVM and y

of the Gaussian kernel (K (x1 ,x2) =exp <—y || <1) (x1) —¢(x2) ||2))
were chosen from {0.1, 1, 10, 100} and {0.005, 0.02, 0.5, 2.0},
respectively.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 2 presents the LOPO cross-validation results for the three
SVM formulations for the 1-spectrum, position-dependent 1-
spectrum and the combination of the two feature representations
for predicting CaM binding sites. We observe that both MIL
formulations (mi-SVM and MI-1 SVM) perform better than the
vanilla SVM. This shows the value of expressing binding site
prediction as an MIL problem. This is particularly evident with
the use of position-dependent feature representations, as they are
more sensitive to changes in relative position of an amino acid
in a window within the binding site than position-independent
feature representations. It can also be noted that the accuracy of
MI-1 SVM is noticeably better than mi-SVM. We believe that
this improvement stems from the fact that the proposed scheme
implements a more realistic model of the binding site prediction
problem. The improvement resulting from switching to a position-
dependent feature representation is also larger for MI-1 SVM than
that observed in the case of mi-SVM. The higher AUC0.1 scores
indicate the improved sensitivity and speciﬁcity of MI-1 SVM which
is also reﬂected in the ~8% improvement in the TH-measures and
the decrease in the FH-measure.

The vanilla SVM approach is the same as the method in (Hamilton
et (11., 2011), which they showed works comparably as the neural
network approach of (Radivoj ac et (11., 2006). Therefore we conclude

that the proposed scheme performs better than previously reported
approaches.

We also compare the performance of these approaches with a
naive local alignment-based method for ﬁnding CaM binding sites.
In this method, local alignment between a held out protein and the
binding sites of the remaining proteins is performed and if the best
scoring alignment overlaps (by at least 10 residues) with the known
binding site in the held out protein, it is considered to be a true hit.
This approach gives a TH% of 39.5%. This shows that the machine
learning approaches presented in this article use more than sequence
similarity to make better predictions.

We have also performed an analysis of the stability of the results
for the MI-1 and the vanilla SVMs by averaging performance
statistics of 12 runs of 5-fold cross-validation. This analysis was
not performed for mi-SVM or for the gappy triplet kernel with
MI-1 SVM owing to their large time requirements. The 5-fold
cross-validation results for both the methods are very similar
to the LOPO cross-validation results. The maximum stande
deviation in a particular performance metric across different feature
representations obtained from the 5-fold cross-validation for vanilla
and MI-1 SVMs is given in Table 2. This statistic gives an idea of
the variability of the results with respect to changes in the data.

Figure 2 shows the output of the MI-1 SVM for a single protein
for the position-dependent and position-independent versions of
the 1-spectrum feature representation. It is quite clear that the
output for the position-independent features is much smoother
than that from the position-dependent 1-spectrum features. This
is because the position-independent 1-spectrum feature vector
representation changes only slightly as the window is translated
by one position, whereas the position-dependent feature vector
can change dramatically. Due to the increased resolution power,
the position-dependent features lead to a classiﬁer that is able to
correctly predict both binding sites in the example shown in Figure 2,
which is not achieved using the position-dependent features.

We have also analyzed the weight vectors from different feature
representations in order to extract amino acid patterns informative
of CaM binding sites. The plot of weights from the 1-spectrum

features and the position-dependent 1-spectrum features are shown
in Figure 3a and b, respectively. The weights for the 1-spectrum
features closely follow the amino acid propensities in CaM bindings
sites (Hamilton et (11., 2011), with R (Arginine), K (Lysine) and W
(Tryptophan) showing large positive weights, whereas D (Aspartic
acid), E (Glutarnic acid) and P (Proline) have large negative weights.
The plot of the position-dependent 1-spectrum features indicates that
the importance of different amino acids varies with their position in
the window. For example, Arginine shows large positive weights
in the middle of the window, and negative weights in the ends;
Glutarnic acid shows the opposite behavior. This indicates that the
classiﬁer is indeed learning a position-dependent model.

The results of 5-fold cross-validation using the position-
dependent gappy triplet kernel (K PDGT) shown in Table 2 indicate
that this kernel provides comparable performance to other feature
representations using MI-1 SVM. Since the number of dimensions
in the feature representation of the gappy triplet kernel is much
larger than the number of training examples, MI-1 SVM learning
was performed using the dual formulation for this kernel, which is
more computationally intensive. That is why we have used 5-fold
cross-validation instead of LOPO cross-validation.

Next, we ranked the features of the gappy triplet kernel in terms of
their weights in MI-1 SVM learning in order to ﬁnd motifs that are
associated with CaM binding. Figure 3c shows the top 100 motifs
and their positions. We observe that motifs tend to associate with
particular positions, showing that MI-1 SVM uses the ﬂexibility
in choosing a representative window to ‘align’ instances of CaM
binding sites (for instance, notice the presence of ‘R’ at positions
10 and 11 across different features). Moreover, it is able to ﬁnd
parts of known CaM binding motifs provided in the CaM Target
Database (Yap et (11., 2000). The CaM Target Database classiﬁes
CaM binding targets into 5 groups, each characterized by certain
motifs: 3 predominantly calcium-dependent motifs (1—10, 1—14
and 1—16, named according to the position of large hydrophobic
residues), the IQ motif which is typically not dependent on calcium
concentration, and others. As is evident from Figure 3c, IQ, QxxxR,
RxxxxR, RGxxxR, RxxL, KxxxxR receive large positive weights.
These motifs are components of the IQ subclass of motifs. Other
features belonging to different subclasses of motifs that receive
large positive weights include: AxxI, IxxxF, LxxV, (from the 1—14
subclass), RR, KK, RxF (from the 1—10 subclass) etc. This clearly
illustrates the capabilities of the proposed scheme to learn CaM
binding motifs. We also note that most of the top ranking features
correspond to a motif with 3 or 4 do not care positions. This is in
agreement with the known fact that CaM binding usually occurs via
an alpha helix, and this corresponds to the periodicity of the alpha
helix.

On the task of CaM binding prediction (Table 3), the performance
of discriminant ﬁinction scoring is only marginally better than that
of the 1-spectrum feature representation used in (Hamilton et (11.,
2011). However, with the cascaded classiﬁcation approach with a
Gaussian kernel, the results are signiﬁcantly better. Even though
the AUC for the position-independent 1-spectrum features is higher
than that of the position-dependent features, the AUC0.1 was higher
for position-dependent features (29.1) in comparison to the simple
1-spectrum features (26.6).

In order to obtain a better understanding of what our classiﬁer
picks up, we considered the proteins that are not known to bind to
CaM and ranked that list according to the score provided by our

classiﬁer. We then tested for enrichment of GO terms of segments
of that list: the ﬁrst 1000 proteins, proteins 1001—2000 etc., using
the GOrilla tool (Eden et (11., 2009). For the ﬁrst 1000 we found
enriched terms that are in agreement with known ﬁ1nctions of CaM
binders (Reddy et (11., 201 1): In GO molecular function, transcription
ﬁ1nction activity and CaM-dependent kinase activities were the most
highly enriched with adjusted p-values below 10_10. All other
enriched terms were related to these except for ‘inward rectiﬁer

potassium channel activity’ which had an adjusted p-value of 0.02. In
GO biological process narnespace all the terms except for ‘response
to carbohydrate stimulus’ (adjusted p-value 0.02) were related to
phosphorylation and various regulatory processes. In analyzing
enrichment for size-1000 chunks we found that the p-values for
these functions and processes went down as we went down the
ranked list, and for proteins ranked 5000—6000, no terms showed
enrichment.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

We have presented a novel MIL algorithm for CaM binding site
prediction called MI-l SVM, and shown its performance advantages
in comparison to the standard MIL SVM and regular SVM, which
was used in previous work. Our new MIL formulation captures the
minimal constraints that a good binding site classiﬁer needs to have,
and we believe this is the reason for its better accuracy. Not only that,
it also runs more than twice as fast as standard MIL SVM (running
time on a dataset of 16,060 windows was 510.5s for MI-l, 1059.ls
for mi-SVM, and 348.3s for vanilla SVM).

Expressing binding site prediction as an MIL problem is a natural
way to incorporate uncertainty about binding site location, and our
results show that this allows the classiﬁer to ‘align’ binding sites
and learn position-dependent motifs that characterize the binding
site. The proposed scheme also shows its efﬁcacy in prediction of
CaM binding proteins.

In general, binding sites in proteins nucleic acids are not
contiguous in sequence as they are in CaM binding proteins. MI-l
SVM can be extended to solve the generic problem of binding site
prediction by using sequence-based features that capture the non-
contiguous nature of binding sites. Currently, MI-l SVM generates
the CaM binding propensity along a protein’s length and cannot
explicitly identify multiple binding sites. Identifying the number of
binding sites in a protein remains for ﬁ1ture work.

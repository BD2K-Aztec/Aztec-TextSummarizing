SRV: an open-source toolbox

 

analysis for the discrimination between two groups, with the
correlation and signiﬁcance testing representation, and the 2D
pseudospectrum allowing the identiﬁcation of coordinated
metabolic variations.

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE SRV ALGORITHM AND
IMPLEMENTATION

The SRV algorithm is divided into ﬁve steps, as schematically
described in the following text (Blaise et al., 2009). The first three
steps correspond to the statistical mining of metabolite bio—
marker signals (i.e. the SRV clusters) from a set of NMR spectra.

Step 1: Deﬁnition of a spectral dependency landscape (L) as
the covariance/correlation ratio between neighbouring variables
along the chemical shift axis:

LU) — Wﬁj + l) = variance(i) >< variance(i + l)

_ correlation

= (Lin—2V) >< (Liaw 1)— (i+—1))2)

i=1

 

Step 2: Identiﬁcation of spectral SRV clusters.

(i) The ﬁrst variable of the dataset starts the ﬁrst cluster.

(ii) The spectral dependency landscape is scanned to identify
local minima of covariance/correlation ratio that represent
the borders between two clusters.

(iii) Clusters representing NMR signals are deﬁned by a min—
imum number of variables, which depends on the reso—
lution of the NMR spectra.

Step 3: Identiﬁcation of NMR variables.

(iv) Superclusters are based on the aggregation of clusters de—
pending on their correlation with their neighbouring clusters.

(v) The intensity of the supercluster is the mean of the inten—
sities of the NMR signal in the buckets assigned to the
supercluster.

Step 4: Evaluation of P—values and multiple dependent tests
correction using the BenjaminiiYekutieli false discovery rate
(Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001). An adjusted P—value threshold
is estimated by the identiﬁcation of the highest rank verifying the
equation below, where N is the number of variables used in the
model. We then can reject all null hypotheses corresponding to
rank 1 to k.

The command line is executed as follow: [Data, Xclusterf,
Ibegin, Iend, number of clusters]=SRV (X matrix, Y matrix,
typical singlet peak base width, bucketing resolution, correlation
threshold, signiﬁcance threshold, ppm, number of factors).

We commonly use the analysis of variance for the evaluation of
P—values and the BenjaminiiYekutieli correction for the measure—
ment of the false discovery rate in our NMR metabolic phenotyp—
ing datasets. However, other evaluation procedures can be used
on SRV clusters based on the properties of the variables under

study. SRV clusters are available in the output Xclusterf of the
SRV function. Data is a four—row table containing the ppm line,
the loading value, the correlation value and the significance of
each initial NMR variable. Xclusterf is a matrix containing the
intensity of the signal in each cluster for the different spectra of the
dataset. Ibegin and Iend are tables containing the limits of each
cluster, and S is a table allowing the identiﬁcation of the initial
NMR signal contained in the SRV clusters and the amount of
signal lost. X matrix is the dataset matrix with spectra in row.
Columns of zeros must represent the excluded residual water
signal area. SRV is not able to deal with multiple exclusion
areas (for instance, NMR buffer signals). In such cases, additional
exclusion areas should simply be removed from the dataset before
the use of SRV. One can eventually choose to reintroduce these
areas in the output matrix of SRV. For the corresponding chem—
ical shifts, O—PLS coefﬁcients and correlation values should be put
to 0 and P—values to 1. Y matrix is the column vector encoding the
membership of each sample to the groups under study. ppm is a
row vector containing the ppm value of each bucket. Number of
factors is the total number of components for the O—PLS analysis,
including the orthogonal ones. The main output of the function is
the loading plot of the O—PLS analysis (Cloarec et al., 20054) with
a colour code of correlation. Variables that are not statistically
signiﬁcant are coloured in grey.

Step 5: Computation and visualization of the SRV 2D
pseudospectrum. Finally, after a deﬂation of the data matrix by
an O—PLS analysis based on the class information matrix (Trygg
and Wold, 2002), we compute the autocorrelation matrix between
SRV clusters identiﬁed within the dataset (Cloarec et al., 2005).

[ORStocsy, Correlation table]: orstocsy (Xclusterf, Y matrix,
number of factors, correlation threshold, Ibegin, Iend, ppm).

ORStocsy is a N x N matrix containing the correlation be—
tween SRV clusters (Blaise et al., 2010, 2011). Correlation table
is a seven—row table containing the identiﬁcation number of the
correlated clusters, the ppm starting and ending values of the
correlated clusters and the level of correlation. The other param—
eters are identical to those described previously.

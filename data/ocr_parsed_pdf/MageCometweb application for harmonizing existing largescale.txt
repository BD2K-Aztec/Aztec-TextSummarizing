ABSTRACT

Motivation: Meta-analysis of large gene expression datasets
obtained from public repositories requires consistently annotated
data. Curation of such experiments, however, is an expert activity
which involves repetitive manipulation of text. Existing tools for
automated curation are few, which bottleneck the analysis pipeline.
Results: We present MageComet, a web application for biologists
and annotators that facilitates the re-annotation of gene expression
experiments in MAGE-TAB format. It incorporates data mining,
automatic annotation, use of ontologies and data validation to
improve the consistency and quality of experimental meta-data from
the ArrayExpress Repository.

Availability and implementation: Source and tutorials for
MageComet are openly available at goo.gl/8LQPR under the GNU
GPL v3 licenses. An implementation can be found at goo.gl/ldCuA

1 INTRODUCTION

The amount of experimental data in public repositories is
accumulating at an ever increasing rate thanks to the advents of high-
throughput technologies. Meta-analysis of these data are limited
by the availability of harmonized, consistently annotated data in
machine readable formats.

In the study of gene expression, MAGE-TAB is a commonly
used ﬁle format that provides ﬂexibility and structure for describing
experimental data (Rayner et al., 2006). Assays in the MAGE-
TAB format can be explicitly annotated with characteristics and
experimental variables, which in turn are referenced to ontologies
to provide explicit meaning. Public repositories such as the
ArrayExpress Archive (Parkinson et al., 2009) house over 23 000
experiments in the MAGE-TAB format, which is also used by the
TCGA project (Hampton, 2006).

The ability to perform meta-analyses requires considerable
investment in human re-annotation, harmonization and mapping of
data from different labs to single ontologies. Due to the spreadsheet
nature of MAGE-TAB, it is a convenient bridge between readability
and interoperability but meta-analysis is faster if formatting,

validation, ontology enrichment and common editing tasks are
addressed within the application. This addresses bottlenecks in the
re-annotation process and allows users to extract implicit meta-data
quickly from pre-existing MAGE-TAB documents and add to this
in a convenient editing environment.

We present MageComet, a web application for curators that
provides semi-automatic tools for annotating existing MAGE-TAB
documents. We have used it to curate hundreds of datasets imported
into ArrayExpress from GEO.

2 SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

2.1 Data input

MageComet is able to edit two of three ﬁles comprising a MAGE-
TAB experiment. It accepts the IDF and SDRF ﬁles, which are both
tab-delimited ﬂat ﬁles containing high-level experiment information
such as experiment design and variables and the SDRF containing
per sample annotation often expressed as text. Curation begins in one
of two ways: users can choose to upload an experiment’s IDF and
SDRF together, or load experiments via an ArrayExpress accession.
Data is displayed to the user through MageComet, which ﬁmctions
as a spreadsheet editor.

2.2 Data summarization

MAGE-TAB ﬁles are conveniently compatible with any spreadsheet
or text editor. However, these editors perform poorly when
displaying the IDF and SDRF components in meaningful ways.
Relevant experiment terms are burried in the text and considerable
time is spent ﬁnding important ﬁelds, especially for large datasets
with long text ﬁelds seen in GEO imported experiments.
MageComet handles this issue in two ways, the ﬁrst being an
ontology driven tag cloud. On loading an experiment, MageComet
automatically data-mines the IDF and SDRF separately using a
designated ontology as its dictionary. The default ontology used is
the Experimental Factor Ontology (Malone et al., 2010). It generates
a tag cloud of terms weighted based on whether found in the IDF or
SDRF (Fig. l). The IDF contains less speciﬁc meta-data terms and
therefore all terms mined are given a lower weight of one. Terms
mined from the SDRF are given a weight of 2, and intersecting terms
have a weight of 3, e.g. a submitter may provide the experimental
context in the IDF by referring to a similar disease. If the disease

is found in the ontology and only referenced in the IDF, it will be
represented in the tag cloud with a weight of one.

The tag cloud provides a visual semantic summary of the dataset
and users grasp general idea of the experiment without in depth
analysis. This is particularly useﬁil when searching for similar
experiments. Clicking on an element in the tag cloud highlights the
corresponding term in the documents, allowing curators to conﬁrm
the context and explore the semantics of the meta-data independently
of the document or ontology structure.

Second MageComet helps extract information via a multi-paneled
View. SDRF and IDF editing panels are complemented by a third
panel where values pertaining to the experimental design are
grouped. MageComet hides columns that do not contain biological
information, users can choose to unhide these. For example,
the names of data ﬁles and protocols are hidden and biological
annotations are prioritized.

2.3 Data extraction tools

MAGE-TAB can contain verbose comments or description
columns—GEO derived data often contains factor values or sample
annotations separated by a varied number delimiters, e.g. colons,
semi-colons or commas. These require further curation to be
informative for large-scale analyses. Separation of such columns is
difﬁcult to automate due to varied delimiters—a simpliﬁed ‘extract’
feature targets this by creating new columns based on what the user
designates as the surrounding delimiters, without the user specifying
a regular expression.

MageComet also has a specialized ‘ﬁlter and replace’ feature.
Unlike common editors, MageComet gives users control of the
source columns from which to ﬁlter from, and the target column
to be replaced. This feature allows users to add factor values and
characteristics to the SDRF based on existing annotations without
repetitive text manipulation.

2.4 Validation

MageComet incorporates the Limpopo (limpopo.sf.net) library into
its backend for syntactic and semantic validation. Curators can edit
and quickly validate changes within the application, allowing for a
seamless work environment.

2.5 Autocompletion

MageComet features an auto complete widget that helps curators
tag samples with consistent annotations. Leveraging the extensive
synonyms available in EFO, MageComet provides a query box
which returns standard labels as deﬁned in the ontology (i.e. Homo
sapiens instead of human). With MageComet’s tight integration with
ontologies, it can also complete the Term Source Ref and Term
Source Number columns in the SDRF for richer annotations.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

MageComet was designed as a web application to provide cross
platform compatibility without installation on client machines. As a
web application, it is able to synchronize with the latest ontologies
and validators to ensure consistent annotations. Its integration into
the web browser makes external services easily accessible. As
a service, MageComet provides validation through the Limpopo
parsers. It provides data mining through Whatizit and interacts with
ontologies using the OntoCat library (Adamusiak er al., 2011).

4 CONCLUSION

MageComet is a web application created for harmonization of large-
scale experiment annotations. It is designed to reduce the repetitive
aspects of re-annotation and curation of pre-existing documents and
serve as a consistent, up-to-date workspace across all platforms. Its
features are designed to provide user-driven automation of repetitive
tasks. It differs from standard editors through it’s close integration
with the MAGE-TAB speciﬁcation. The implementation and code
can be found at goo.gl/IdCuA, and goo.gl/SLQPR, respectively.

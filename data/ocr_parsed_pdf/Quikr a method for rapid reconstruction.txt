ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many metagenomic studies compare hundreds to thou-
sands of environmental and health-related samples by extracting and
sequencing their 168 rRNA amplicons and measuring their similarity
using beta-diversity metrics. However, one of the first steps—to clas-
sify the operational taxonomic units within the sample—can be a com-
putationally time-consuming task because most methods rely on
computing the taxonomic assignment of each individual read out of
tens to hundreds of thousands of reads.

Results: We introduce Quikr: a QUadratic, K-mer—based, Iterative,
Reconstruction method, which computes a vector of taxonomic as-
signments and their proportions in the sample using an optimization
technique motivated from the mathematical theory of compressive
sensing. On both simulated and actual biological data, we demon-
strate that Quikr typically has less error and is typically orders of mag-
nitude faster than the most commonly used taxonomic assignment
technique (the Ribosomal Database Project’s Naive Bayesian
Classifier). Furthermore, the technique is shown to be unaffected by
the presence of chimeras, thereby allowing for the circumvention of
the time-intensive step of chimera filtering.

Availability: The Quikr computational package (in MATLAB, Octave,
Python and C) for the Linux and Mac platforms is available at http://

1 INTRODUCTION

Reconstructing the taxonomic composition of a bacterial com-
munity taken from an environmental sample (be it a human-
associated, ocean, or soil sample) is critical for understanding
the role that such a community might play in affecting change
in that environment. A popular reconstruction approach (Cole
et al., 2009; J umpstart Group, 2012; Lan et al., 2012; Wang and
Zhang, 2011, Wang et al., 2007) is to use 16S rRNA amplicon
sequencing (like Roche’s 454 technology) to produce many
(~400 00(%1000000) moderate-length (~40(%700bp) reads of
speciﬁc variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene and then indi-
vidually classify these reads using a custom database with
BLAST or in a Bayesian framework like the Ribosomal

Database Project’s (RDP) Naive Bayesian Classiﬁer (NBC)
(Wang et al., 2007). RDP’s NBC is widely used owing to its
speed but it can still take several days to assign millions of
reads on a desktop computer, thereby alienating users who do
not have access to large computer clusters.

We introduce a method that enables desktop analysis: we take
a novel approach by reconstructing all taxonomic concentrations
of a bacterial community simultaneously (as opposed to read-by-
read classiﬁcation). This allows for orders of magnitude decrease
in execution time while maintaining comparable (and often
better) reconstruction ﬁdelity. This method, based on ideas
from compressive sensing, was inspired by and tangentially
related to (Amir and Zuk, 2011) wherein sparsity-promoting al-
gorithms were used to analyze mixtures of dye-terminator reads
resulting from Sanger sequencing. Here, however, we take a
k-meribased approach that is designed for high-throughput
sequencing technologies. This is similar in spirit to the k—meri
based approach in (Meinicke et al., 2011) but herein we use a
distribution estimation procedure based on compressive sensing.
Put brieﬂy, our method measures the frequency of k—mers (for a
fixed k~ 6) in a database of 16S rRNA genes for known bacteria,
calculates the frequency of k—mers in the given sample, and then
reconstructs the concentrations of the bacteria in the sample by
solving an underdetermined system of linear equations under
a sparsity assumption. To solve this system, we employ
MATLAB’s (MATLAB, 2012) iterative implementation of typ-
ical nonnegative least squares and hence we refer to this method
as Quikr: QUadratic, Iterative, K-meribased Reconstruction. We
point out that Quikr has not yet been optimized for performance
but still demonstrates orders of magnitude speed improvement
over RDP’s NBC.

2 METHODS

2.1 k-mer training matrix

The training step consists of converting an input database of 16S rRNA
sequences into a k-mer training matrix. For a ﬁxed k-mer size, we calcu-
late the frequency of each k-mer in each database sequence. Hence, given
a database of 16S rRNA sequences D 2 {db . . . , dM}, the (i,j)th entry of
the k-mer training matrix A“) is the frequency of the ith k-mer (in lex-
icographic order) in the jth sequence 

Herein, we consider two different databases of 16S rRNA sequences.
The ﬁrst database, Dsmau, is the same as the training database for RDP’s
NBC version 7. This database consists of 10 046 sequences and will allow
for direct comparison of Quikr to RDP’s NBC.

The second database, Dlargc, consists of the 275727 sequences that
remained after applying TaxCollector (Giongo et al., 2010) to the
entire RDP 16S rRNA database 10.28. Applying TaxCollector had the
net effect of labeling each sequence with taxonomic information obtained
from NCBI (Benson et al., 2009; Sayers et al., 2009), discarding duplicate
sequences and discarding sequences that were missing genus labels.
Training the RDP’s NBC with the database DlmgC would lead to prohibi-
tively long classiﬁcation times (>17min per read on a 2.0 GHz Intel
E7-4820 processor) and so demonstrates how Quikr can incorporate
much more known information than RDP’s NBC.

Forming the k-mer training matrix for Dsmau and DlargC took ~15 s and
15min, respectively, on a 2.0GHz Intel E7-4820 processor.

2.2 Sample k-mer frequencies

Given a sample dataset of 16S rRNA reads, we calculate the frequency of
all k-mers in the entire sample. We refer to this vector sa‘) as the sample
k-mer frequency vector. Note that the calculation of so” is an easily par-
allelizable problem that can be computed efﬁciently in an online fashion.

2.3 Sparsity promoting quadratic optimization

We assume that the given environmental sample only contains bacteria
that exist in the database D 2 {d1, ..., dM} being used. Hence, we can
represent the composition of the sample as a vector x with non-negative
entries summing to one (i.e. a probability vector) where x,- is the concen-
tration of the organism with 16S rRNA sequence d,-. However, as will be
demonstrated in section 3.5, the Quikr method still performs well when
the sample does contain novel bacteria not in the database being used.

We consider the idealized situation, in which sample noise and errors
introduced by short reads are ignored. The problem at hand is then to
reconstruct the bacterial concentrations x by solving the underdeterrnined
linear system

AW): = s“), (1)

Under the plausible assumption that relatively few bacteria from the
database D are actually present in the given sample (that is, x is a
sparse vector), we can solve equation (1) by modifying some techniques
from compressive sensing. We use a variant of basis-pursuit denoising
(Chen et al., 1998), which reduces to a non-negative least squares prob-
lem. The details regarding this sparsity promoting, iterative, quadratic
optimization procedure are contained in the Supplementary Material.
Occasionally, Quikr experiences convergence issues. However, as de-
tailed in the Supplementary Material, ﬁltering out the shortest sequences
from a given sample solved this issue in every situation we encountered.

2.4 Reconstruction metrics

There are a variety of metrics used in the literature to asses bacterial
community reconstruction ﬁdelity (for example see Amir and Zuk,
2011; Clemente et al., 2011; Rosen et al., 2008, Segata et al., 2012 and
Wang et al., 2007). We denote the actual and predicted concentrations of
the bacteria as probability vectors x and x*, respectively. The reconstruc-
tion metric primarily used herein is the (1 distance between x and x*:
H): — x*||yl. This quantity takes values between 0 and 2 (with perfect
reconstruction being ||x — ﬁll)l = 0) and is commonly referred to as
‘total error’ (as it is the total of the absolute errors). We also use precision,
sensitivity, speciﬁcity and accuracy; these error metrics vary between 0
and l (with higher values reﬂecting better reconstruction fidelity).
The deﬁnitions of these quantities are contained in the Supplementary
Material. Note that the correlation between x and x* is not an
effective reconstruction metric because the sparsity of x and x*
and the high number of true negatives typically make
corr(x,x*) := xTx*/(||x||2||x*||2) too close to the optimal value 1.

The term reconstruction ﬁdelity will be used to communicate generic-
ally how well x* approximates x.

2.5 Simulated data

To test the performance of the Quikr method, the shotgun/amplicon read
simulator Grinder (Angly et al., 2012) was used to generate a large variety
of simulated 454 pyrosequencing datasets. These datasets were designed
to mimic reads generated by Roche’s GS FLX and FLX+ amplicon
systems, so read-length distributions were set to be normally distributed
with a mean of 400 or 700 bp and a standard deviation of 50 or 100 bp.
The primers B27F, B357F and BU968F were chosen to target the Vl-V3,
V3-V5 and V6-V9 variable regions, respectively. Only forward primers
were used because amplicon sequencing allows for ﬁltering on sequencing
direction. Three different diversity values were chosen to be 102, 103 and
104, and abundance was modeled by a power-law or exponential distri-
bution with parameters 0.705 and 1, respectively. Because most sequen-
cing errors in these systems are due to homopolymer errors, such errors
were modeled by using Balzer’s model (Balzer et al., 2010). Chimera
percentages were set at 0, 10 and 30%. Since only amplicon sequencing
is considered, no copy or length bias was employed.

In all, 216 different simulated datasets were generated with over 172
million reads, resulting in over 78 billion bases.

2.6 Mock communities

To benchmark the Quikr method on real biological data, we examined
the mock microbial communities developed in (Haas et al., 2011). These
communities contain staggered concentrations of 16S rRNA genes for
each of 21 different organisms that span a diverse range of properties (GC
content, genome size, etc.). This mock microbial community was then
sequenced independently at four different institutions with primers de-
signed to target the Vl-V3, V3-V5 and V6-V9 variable regions resulting in
12 different 454 datasets with an average read length of 439 bp and stand-
ard deviation 38 bp. Detail regarding the precise conditions under which
this data was obtained appears in (Haas et al., 2011, pages 49%500).

2.7 Human microbiome data

To further benchmark the Quikr method on real biological data, we
applied the Quikr method to the Human Microbiome Project’s (HMP;
The Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012) trimmed sequences
resulting from SRA study id SRP002395. This dataset consists of ap-
proximately 72 million reads over 5034 samples targeting the V17V3
and V&V9 variables regions.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Speed comparison

We performed all benchmarks against RDP’s NBC because this
is considered to be the fastest 16S rRNA classiﬁer to date (Liu
et al., 2008). Figure 1 shows a log-10g plot of the number of reads
analyzed versus time for RDP’s NBC version 10.28 with training
set 7 (this is the same as database Dsmn, see section 2.1) and
Quikr with k: 6 using the database Dsmu. Note the signiﬁcant
improvement in speed: it takes Quikr well less than 1min to
analyze over 1 million reads. While RDP’s NBC computational
complexity in the number of reads N is approximately O(N), on
this data Quikr is approximately (9(N1/5).

3.2 Simulated data results

The Quikr method was applied to all 216 simulated datasets
using k-mer sizes in the range k = 1, . . . , 6 for both databases

Dsman and Dlarge. We observed that at the genus level the mean £1
error decreased roughly linearly (linear regression R2 = 0.953) as
a function of k-mer size. However, the total algorithm time
increased exponentially. This behavior is to be expected owing
to the exponential increase in number of k—mers as a function of
k. These patterns were observed at all taxonomic ranks with both
training databases. We recommend using the k—mer size k = 6, as
this provides a good trade-off between reconstruction fidelity
and execution time.

For comparison purposes, we also classiﬁed the simulated
data using the popular RDP’s NBC (Wang et al., 2007) version
10.28 with training set 7 (this is the same training data as the
database Dsman). Figure 2 compares the timing, mean £1 error at
various taxonomic ranks, as well as precision, sensitivity, speci-
ﬁcity and accuracy at the genus level between Quikr (using k-mer
size k: 6) and RDP’s NBC.

As part (a) of Figure 2 shows, Quikr is orders of magnitude
faster than RDP’s NBC no matter which training database is
used. Indeed, using Dlarge, Quikr took an average of 1730s per
dataset (or 520 reads per second). Using Dsman, Quikr took an
average of only 26.4s per dataset (or 34091 reads per second).
Compare this with RDP’s NBC taking an average of 23 978 s per
dataset (or 38 reads per s).

Part (b) in Figure 2 demonstrates that both methods show an
increase in mean £1 error as one moves to lower taxonomic ranks.
At the genus level and using the training database Dlarge, Quikr
shows a 46.5% improvement in £1 error over RDP’s NBC. Using
the training database Dsmau, Quikr has comparable error to RDP’s
NBC down to the family level. Using this smaller database, Quikr
results in more error than RDP’s NBC at the genus level.

Part (c) in Figure 2 shows that when using Dlarge, Quikr has
comparable speciﬁcity and accuracy, and only slightly lower
averages for precision and sensitivity when compared with
RDP’s NBC at the genus level. This pattern continues when
using the database Dsman except here Quikr is much less sensitive
than RDP’s NBC but shows comparable precision, speciﬁcity
and accuracy.

These results demonstrate that when using the training data-
base Dsmau, Quikr is an extremely fast method that gives a good
high-level characterization of a given sample. When using the
training database Dlarge, Quikr is a fast and accurate classiﬁca-
tion method even down to the genus level.

We analyzed the 12 mock communities with the Quikr method

the timing, mean £1 error at various taxonomic ranks, as well as
the remaining error metrics at the genus level between Quikr and
RDP’s NBC. Similarly to the simulated data in section 3.2, with
training database Dlarge, Quikr is on average much faster than
RDP’s NBC, and signiﬁcantly faster when using the train-
ing database Dsman [(see part (a) of Fig. 3)]. As part (b) of
Figure 3 shows, the £1 errors of both methods are comparable.
Furthermore, when using the training database Dlarge, Quikr has
less error than RDP’s NBC at the genus level. Lastly, when
Quikr uses the training database Dlarge, both methods have com-
parable precision, sensitivity, speciﬁcity and accuracy (note
Quikr is slightly more precise, specific and accurate). When
using Dsman, Quikr is significantly less sensitive than RDP’s
NBC, but the other error metrics give similar values.

Figure 4 shows the consensus/mean predicted phyla over all 12
mock communities for both the Quikr method (using database
Dsman) and RDP’s NBC. The correlation between predicted and
actual concentrations for Quikr is 0.9724 versus RDP’s NBC
correlation of 0.9700. The concentrations for each phyla as pre-
dicted by Quikr are closer on average to the actual concentra-
tions than that of RDP’s NBC at the cost of a false-positive
phylum of Tenericutes. However, the mock communities con-
tained 18S rRNA of Candida albicans and the k—mer frequencies
of this species is closer to the average k—mer frequencies of the
Tenericutes than any other phyla. Future plans for Quikr include
developing a measure for novel taxa so as to address this issue of
potential false positives.

This demonstrates again that when using the training database
Dsman, Quikr is an extremely fast method that gives a good high-
level characterization of a given sample. When using the training
database Dlarge, Quikr is a fast and very accurate classiﬁcation
technique.

3.4 HMP results

To demonstrate that Quikr is ﬁt for utilization on a desktop com-
puter, we analyzed the 5034 samples of HMP data on an iMac
with a 3.4GHz Intel i-7 processor. Using the default training
database Dsman (which corresponds to RDP’s training set 7),
Quikr took 7.6h to analyze the entire HMP data set. Retraining
with the Greengenes (DeSantis et al., 2006) 91%-OTU database
of 5878 sequences, Quikr took only 4.8h to analyze the entire
HMP dataset. The results of analyzing the HMP data with the
Grenegenes database were then analyzed in QIIME (Caporaso
et al., 2010) to produce a PCoA plot, which is included in
Figure 5. This plot can be compared with Figure 1a in (Koren
et al., 2013) reproduced here as Figure 5c. To quantify the vari-
ability of a particular category (body site in this case), QIIME
(Caporaso et al., 2010) includes several methods, such as Adonis
and ANOSIM, which can asses the statistical signiﬁcance of
groupings in a PCoA plot as well as indicate how much of the
variation is explained by such groupings. Because we did not have
the ﬁle that generated Figure 5c and are only demonstrating the
concept of applying Quikr for generating fast PCoA plots, we did
not investigate further such quantitative comparisons. The results
are qualitatively similar enough in their clustering and distinguish-
ing of body sites to conclude that Quikr is effective in facilitating
the transformation of raw reads into an accurate PCoA plot in
less than a workday on a typical scientist’s desktop computer.

cross-validation, the k-mer size was ﬁxed at k: 6. The database
Dlarge described in section 2.1 was partitioned into ﬁve disjoint
sets and one-ﬁfth was set aside as testing data with the remaining
four-ﬁfth used to form a new k-mer matrix as in section 2.1.
Grinder (Angly et al., 2012) parameters were then chosen to
generate a test sample from the testing data. In particular,
these parameters were chosen as follows: primers targeting the
Vl-V3 variable regions, read lengths normally distributed with
mean 400 bp and standard deviation 50 bp, 800000 total reads,
exponential abundance model, diversity of 100 species, homopo-
lymer error model as in Balzer (Balzer et al., 2010) and 10%
chimera percentage. The mean of each reconstruction metrics
was then taken over the choice of which one-ﬁfth was the testing
data. Lastly, an average was taken over 10 iterates of this pro-
cedure. RDP’s NBC was also used to classify the test samples.
Table 1 summarizes the results of this procedure for the i1 error
metric. Because Quikr has a smaller mean i1 error and tighter
variance, this demonstrates that even if the given sample contains
novel sequences not present in the database, the Quikr method will
still give high reconstruction ﬁdelity down to the genus level.
Similar results were observed for the remaining error metrics.

3.6 Chimeras

The presence of chimeras in an amplicon sample can signiﬁcantly
affect downstream analysis when using classiﬁcation algorithms
such as Bayesian classiﬁers (Ashelford et al., 2005), and is pos-
sibly the culprit for overestimates of the so-called ‘rare biosphere’
(Edgar et al., 2011). Identifying and removing chimeras is a com-
putationally intensive and only partially solved problem (Edgar
et al., 2011, Haas et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2004; Quince et al.,
2011). It is therefore a significant advantage of the Quikr method
that it is completely unaffected by the presence of chimeras.
Quikr’s unaffectedness by chimeras is due to the k—mer frequency
of a chimera being well-estimated by the weighted sum of the
k-mer frequencies of the constituent sequences that generated the
chimera.

To present experimental evidence of this invariance, we se-
lected Grinder (Angly et al., 2012) parameters to be the same
as in section 3.5, but varied the percentage of chimeras from 0 to
100% in 10% increments, with 10 simulations being performed
at each increment. An ANOVA analysis resulted in P=0.927,
hence there is no statistically signiﬁcant evidence that the slope of
a linear regression deviates from zero. Figure 6 illustrates this
fact by plotting the mean £1 error and standard deviation over
the 10 simulations versus percent chimeras. Hence, it can be
concluded that it is unnecessary to ﬁlter for chimeras before
using the Quikr method.

4 DISCUSSION

Quikr represents a new paradigm in algorithms for bacterial
community reconstruction. By leveraging ideas from compressive
sensing, an entire sample can be analyzed quickly and accurately.

Depending on how it is trained, Quikr can be used as either an
extremely rapid, almost constant time, high-level community
profiling tool or else (using a larger training database) a fast,
extremely accurate technique. Besides improvements in speed,
other advantages include the ability to use massive training data-
bases (like Dlarge) that would be much too large for standard
techniques (like RDP’s NBC). Furthermore, Quikr is unaffected
by the presence of chimeras, so the time-consuming chimera-
removal step in standard analytic pipelines can be completely
circumvented.

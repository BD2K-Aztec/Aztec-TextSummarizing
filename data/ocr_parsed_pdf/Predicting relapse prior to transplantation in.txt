ABSTRACT

Motivation: Selecting a small number of signature genes for
accurate classification of samples is essential for the development
of diagnostic tests. However, many genes are highly correlated in
gene expression data, and hence, many possible sets of genes
are potential classifiers. Because treatment outcomes are poor in
advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we hypothesized that
expression of classifiers of advanced phase CML when detected
in early CML [chronic phase (CP) CML], correlates with subsequent
poorer therapeutic outcome.

Results: We developed a method that integrates gene expression
data with expert knowledge and predicted functional relationships
using iterative Bayesian model averaging. Applying our integrated
method to CML, we identified small sets of signature genes that
are highly predictive of disease phases and that are more robust
and stable than using expression data alone. The accuracy of
our algorithm was evaluated using cross-validation on the gene
expression data. We then tested the hypothesis that gene sets
associated with advanced phase CML would predict relapse after
allogeneic transplantation in 176 independent CP CML cases.
Our gene signatures of advanced phase CML are predictive of
relapse even after adjustment for known risk factors associated with
transplant outcomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

The prediction of the diagnostic category of a tissue sample from its
expression array phenotype given the availability of similar data
from tissues in identiﬁed categories is known as ‘Classiﬁcation’
(or ‘supervised learning’). In the context of gene expression data,
the samples are usually the experiments, and the Classes are
usually different types of tissue samples, for example, cancer versus
non-cancer e.g. (Alon et (11., 1999), different tumor types e.g.
(Ramaswamy et (11., 2001), prognostic outcomes e.g. (van ’t Veer

et (11., 2002), or different stages of disease e.g. (Radich et (11.,
2006). A Challenge in predicting the diagnostic categories using gene
expression data is that the number of genes is usually much greater
than the number of tissue samples available, and only a subset of
the genes is relevant in distinguishing different Classes. Selection of
predictive signature genes for Classiﬁcation is known as ‘variable
selection’ or ‘feature selection’. A wide variety of algorithms have
been proposed in the literature to select predictive signature genes,
e.g. (Abeel et (11., 2010; Chen et (11., 2009; Lee et (11., 2003; Nguyen
and Rocke, 2002; Tusher et (11., 2001 ; Yang and Song, 2010). A small
set of relevant genes is essential for the development of inexpensive
diagnostic tests.

Different feature selection algorithms can potentially select
different relevant genes, different numbers of relevant genes and
lead to different Classiﬁcation accuracy (Xu and Wong, 2010). Ein-
Dor et (11. (2005) reported that gene selection is heavily inﬂuenced
by the subset of patients even when the feature selection method
and data set stayed constant. This is mainly due to the fact that
many genes have similar correlations with the Class labels, and much
larger training sets are needed to generate a robust gene list (Ein-
Dor et (11., 2006). The lack of overlap between the genes of different
prognostic signatures is well documented, e.g. (Drier and Domany,
2011; Dupuy and Simon, 2007; Michiels et (11., 2005). Ioannidis
(2005) commented that the discovery of the true gene signature
remains a Challenge, and emphasized the importance of independent
validation and large sample size. Another critique of existing feature
selection methods includes the lack of biological meaning of the
signature genes (Drier and Domany, 2011).

In this article, we present a novel approach that integrates
expert knowledge and predicted functional relationships with gene
expression analysis to derive gene signatures. We aim to select
‘robust’ signature genes that are ‘both predictive and biologically
relevant’ to the mechanism underlying the disease of interest.
Our method uses expert knowledge and predicted functional
relationships to guide our search for signature genes among the many
possible genes that are highly correlated with the Class labels and
with each other. Our method is based on the idea that genes that are
functionally related to a reference gene set known to be associated
with the disease of interest are more likely to be biologically relevant
to this disease. Figure 1 shows an overview of our method.

treated effectively progresses through accelerated phase (AP) to the
acute leukemia phase of blast crisis (BC). A reciprocal translocation
between chromosomes 9 and 22 yields the Bcr-Abl fusion protein
that is the primary driver of CML disease. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), such as imatinib (IM), dasatinib and nilotinib, which target
the constitutiver active Abl tyrosine kinase, are effective ﬁrst-line
therapy for CP CML (Druker et (11., 2001). However, TKIs are
signiﬁcantly less effective in AF or BC CML where not only Bcr-Abl
dependent, but also Bcr-Abl independent mechanisms are at work
(Druker et (11., 2006; Faderl et (11., 1999; Hansen et (11., 1998; Melo
and Barnes, 2007; Quintas-Cardama and Cortes, 2009; Ren, 2005;
Sawyers et (11., 2002; Shah, 2008). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) is generally reserved for CP patients
who are resistant to TKI therapy, or patients who have AF or BC
CML. HSCT is associated with >80% survival when performed
in CF, but outcomes are signiﬁcantly worse for advanced disease,
~40% in AP and <20% in BC (Hansen et (11., 1998; Radich et (11.,
2003).

There are no established molecular predictors of transplant
outcome in CML, thus Clinical measures such as the Sokal, Hasford,
or European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)
Risk Scores have been used for prognostication (Gratwohl et (11.,
1998; Hasford et (11., 1996; MCWeeney et (11., 2010; Mohty et (11.,
2007; Sokal et (11., 1984; Yong et (11., 2006). The EBMT score
has been validated extensively, and is used to predict outcomes
prior to HSCT (Gratwohl et (11., 1998; Passweg et (11., 2004). The
variables that comprise the EBMT score are: phase of disease
(CP, AF, or BC), transplant donor type (related donor versus
unrelated donor), donor/recipient sex combination (female donor
into male recipient versus all other combinations), patient age and
interval from diagnosis to transplantation (Gratwohl et (11., 1998).
However, the EBMT risk score does not entirely account for the
heterogeneity observed in transplant outcomes. Consequently, our
goal is to identify molecular prognostic predictors to supplement
known Clinical risk variables and guide risk-adjusted therapy at
diagnosis.

We previously applied a probabilistic method called iterative
Bayesian model averaging (iBMA) to a microarray data set
consisting of patients in different phases of CML (Oehler
et (11., 2009b) and identiﬁed a 6-gene signature that accurately
discriminated CP from BC. BMA is a multivariate method that
accounts for the uncertainty in the selection of signature genes

by averaging over multiple models (Hoeting et (11., 1999; Raftery,
1995), i.e. sets of potentially overlapping predictive genes. It yields
posterior probabilities of the predictions and of the inclusion of
each gene in the model. We extended BMA to be applied to
high dimensional gene expression data and showed that the iBMA
algorithm identiﬁes small gene sets with high prediction accuracy
(Yeung et (11., 2005). We also showed that our 6-gene signature
discriminated CP, AP and BC patients and hypothesized a signature
associated with progression when detected in CF may predict poorer
outcomes, because expression of these genes reﬂects evidence of
more advanced disease at the molecular level in CF patients (Oehler
et (11., 2009b). In this study we build upon our iBMA method and
validate this hypothesis.

1.2 Our contributions

We present a novel integrated method that by incorporating genes
relevant to CML disease and progression not only produced accurate
class predictions, but also yielded gene signatures that are more
robust and stable than using gene expression data alone. Our
method can be applied to other high-throughput data, including
the expression of genes, proteins, microRNAs, or single nucleotide
polymorphism variations. Our ﬁndings were substantiated in 196
independent CML patient samples. Speciﬁcally, we show that
a molecular signature associated with disease progression when
detected in CF patients prior to HSCT drives outcomes after
transplantation even after adjusting for contributions from known
Clinical risk factors.

2 METHODS
2.1 BMA

BMA takes model uncertainty into consideration by averaging over the
posterior distributions of a quantity of interest based on multiple models.
weighted by their posterior model probabilities (Hoeting 61611., 1999; Raftery,
1995). In the case of binary classiﬁcation. let Y be the class of a sample in
the test set. where Y=0 or 1. and let D be the ‘trajning data set’ for which
the classes are known. In BMA. the posterior probability of Y=1 given
the training set D is the weighted average of the posterior probability of
Y=1 given the training set D and model Mk multiplied by the posterior
probability of model Mk given training set D. summing over a set of models
Mk for k in B. where B is a set of indices. mathematically. Pr(Y=1lD):

ZPr(Y=1|D,Mk)>t<Pr(Mk|D). We used logistic regression (Hosmer and
keB
Lemeshow. 2000) to evaluate Pr(Y=1lD. Mk). When classifying samples

on microarray data. our goal is to identify the relevant genes (or variables).
The posterior probability of gene X, is equal to the sum of the posterior
probabilities of all selected models Mk that include this gene. Hence. all
relevant genes are included in at least one chosen model.

In order to efﬁciently identify a reduced set of models Mk for the weighted
average calculations. Raftery (1995) used the leaps and bounds algorithm
(Furnival and Wilson. 1974) which rapidly returns the best nbest models of
each size up to w genes (w = 30. nbest = 10 in our experiments). Madigan and
Raftery (1994) proposed the Occam’s window method as a way of choosing
a set of parsimonious and data-supported models. Their idea is to discard
models that are much less likely than the best model supported by the data
(the default is 20 times less likely in terms of model likelihood). Therefore.
the set of models used in the weighted average calculations is chosen by
ﬁrst applying the leaps and bounds algorithm. and then the Occarn’s window
method. We used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to approximate the
posterior probability of a model Mk (Kass and Raftery, 1995). In this study.
we used the R package ‘BMA’ and the bioconductor package ‘iterativeBMA’.

Predicting relapse in CML

 

2.2 iBMA algorithm

To apply BMA to the high-dimensional gene expression data. we used the
iterative BMA (iBMA) method of Young et a1. (2005). In iBMA. we ﬁrst
ranked the genes in order with a univariate gene selection method and
then successively applied BMA to the ordered genes. In the univariate
ranking step. genes with relatively large variation between classes and
relatively small variation within classes received high rankings. We then
applied BMA to the w top ranked genes (w=30). Then variables to which
the BMA algorithm assigned low posterior probabilities (<5%) of being in
the predictive model were removed. Suppose m variables were removed. The
next In variables from the rank ordered R2 were added so that we maintained
a window of w variables and applied BMA again. These steps of gene swaps
and iterative applications of BMA were continued until we considered all
top v variables in our univariate ranked gene list.

2.3 Selection of reference genes

Reference genes represented input expert knowledge that are chosen
independent of the gene expression data. They were compiled from pathways
involved in CML disease and CML disease progression and included
genes involved in Bcr-Abl signaling. the stem cell associated pathways
Hedgehog and WNT. as well as individual candidates known to be associated
with disease progression (e.g. SET. PRAME) or have been described in
leukemia stem/progenitor cells (Jarnieson at (11.. 2004; Melo and Barnes.
2007; Neviani at (11.. 2005; Oehler at (11.. 2009a; Quintas-Cardarna and
Cortes. 2009; Stirewalt at (11.. 2008; Zhao et (11.. 2009) (Supplementary
Table Sl). An expanded set included all genes in the base set. but
included additional candidates from the pathways and sources listed above
(Supplementary Table S2).

2.4 Functional linkage network

The functional linkage network (FLN) is an evidence-weighted network
aimed to represent the functional associations between human genes related
to different diseases (Linghu at (11.. 2009). The FLN was constructed using
a naive Bayes classiﬁer integrating various functional genomics features.
including co-expression data. proteiniprotein interactions. protein domain
sharing. co-occurrence in PubMed abstracts and functional associations
mapped from other organisms. The nodes in FLN represented individual
genes and the weighted undirected edges (quantiﬁed by the log likelihood
ratio scores. LR) represented the degree of their overall functional association
upon combining various data sources. The FLN is extremely dense. with the
average number of neighbors per gene approximately 2000 even with a LR
score cut-off at 1. Linghu et a1. (2009) illustrated the utility of the FLN in the
prioritization of candidate genes in various diseases. and proposed that the
associations identiﬁed by the FLN could be used to derive novel hypotheses
on molecular mechanisms underlying diseases and therapies.

2.5 Integrated iBMA algorithm

The FLN is a weighted undirected graph consisting of 21657 nodes and
~22.4 million edges with a median edge weight (LR score) of 0.21 (Linghu
at (11.. 2009). The nodes (genes) of the FLN are represented by Entrez Gene
IDs. We obtained a sub-graph of the full FLN consisting of genes proﬁled
in the CML progression microarray data (see Section 2.7). This sub-graph
(denoted as FLN-sub) consisted of 11514 nodes and ~11.7 million edges.
As we increased the LR score threshold from log(5) to log(50). the average
degree per node in FLN-sub reduced from 31.4 to 4.2. We empirically
determined a LR score threshold for the edges by evaluating the average
prediction accuracy over 3-fold cross-validation repeated 100 times using
the gene expression data (see Table 1). Supplementary Figure Sl shows a
ﬂow chart of this process.

After mapping the reference genes to their unique Entrez Gene IDs. we
located them on the FLN and identiﬁed neighbor genes that were connected
to these reference genes (i.e. path length 1 from the reference genes). We then

(4) Apply iBMA to the union of the reference and neighbor sets.

2.6 Microarray data studying CML progression

We used the CP (42) and BC (30) patient samples in the published CML
progression microarray data (Radich at (11.. 2006). which is available from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number
GSE4170. After ﬁltering out probes on the arrays that were not mapped
to any Entrez Gene IDs. 12 734 genes were used in our analyses.

2.7 Evaluation of predictive performance on
microarray data

We evaluated predictive performance on the microarray data using 3-fold
cross-validation repeated 100 times. We computed the average percentage
error as the average fraction of classiﬁcation errors over 72 samples (42
CP + 30 BC) in 100 cross-validation runs. We also adopted the average
Brier Score (Brier. 1950) that accounts for the magnitudes of predicted
probabilities. The Brier Score is deﬁned as the sum of squares of the
difference between the true class label and the predicted probability over
all samples. If the predicted probabilities are constrained to equal to 0 or 1.
the Brier Score is equal to the total number of classiﬁcation errors.

2.8 Quantitative PCR validation data

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to validate gene expression in 222 patient
samples (176 CP. 23 AP. 14 BC-remission and 9 BC). Bone marrow samples
were obtained from Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Written
informed consent is according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Among CP
patients. 26 patients had samples assessed by both qPCR and microarray
gene expression (Radich at 611., 2006). whereas 196 samples were uniquely
assessed by qPCR. Gene expression. performed in duplicate. was quantitated
and normalized to GUSB expression (control gene) by qPCR (Applied
Biosystems) as previously described (Oehler at 611., 2009b; Radich at 611.,
1995. 2001).

2.9 Analyses of qPCR data

We divided our CP patients further into CP-early (120 patients) and CP-late
(56 patients). Patients deﬁned as CP-early were within 1 year of diagnosis at
the time when the sample was drawn. Patients with early CP are less likely
to develop resistance on TKI therapy (Branford at 611., 2003) or relapse after
allogeneic transplantation (Gratwohl at 611., 1998; Passweg at 611., 2004). We
transformed our qPCR data logarithmically and ignored patient samples with
missing data. Due to the limited number of BC patient samples (n29). we
computed prediction models for CP-early versus AP (120 CP-early versus 23
AP samples). Since the microarray data and the qPCR data are on different
scales. we re-ﬁtted the BMA models using cross-validation. In other words.
after we identiﬁed the signature genes by applying our integrated iBMA
method to the CML progression microarray data. we computed the regression
coefﬁcients of these signature genes using 10-fold cross-validation on the
qPCR data.

We used ‘bagging’ to address the issue of the unbalanced class sizes (120
CP-early versus 23 AP samples). In each fold of the cross-validation. let
Train-large be the training data of the larger class (i.e. CP-early) and let Train-
small be the training data of the smaller class (i.e. AP). Let n-large and n-small
be the sizes of the training data Train-large and Train-small. respectively.
Also. let the test data of the larger and smaller classes be Test-large and Test-
small. respectively. We then repeated the following bagging step 20 times:
we randomly sampled n-small samples in Train-large with replacement.
computed the BMA models using these n-small random samples from Train-
large and all the samples from Train-small. and predicted the test samples
in Test-large and Test-small using this model. The predicted class label of
each test sample is equal to the majority class over these 20 bagging runs. In
other words. each of these 20 bagging runs carried a weight of 1/20. and the
predicted probability for each test sample is equal to the number of times this
sample is predicted to be class 1 divided by 20. We observed that different
numbers of bagging runs produced similar results (data not shown).

2.10 Patient and transplant characteristics

Patient and transplant characteristics and calculation of the EBMT score for
176 CP CML patients are shown in Supplementary Table S3. The median
sample draw date prior to transplantation was 22 days prior (range. 07250
days prior). Transplants occurred between 1993 and 2007. The majority
of patients did not receive TKI prior to transplantation. IM was approved
by the FDA as second-line therapy in 2001 and as ﬁrst-line therapy in
2003. Fifty-one patients underwent allogeneic transplantation from 2002
onwards and improved cytogenetic responses prior to transplantation suggest
these patients were treated with TKI prior to transplantation. Cytogenetic
responses were characterized as follows: complete [0% Philadelphia (Ph)-
positive cells]. partial (1734% Ph-positive cells). minor (35$5% Ph-positive
cells). minimal (66795% Ph-positive cells). or no (9&100%). KaplaniMeier
estimates were used to summarize the probability of overall and disease-
free survival. Cumulative incidence estimates were used to summarize
the probability of relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Relapse was
regarded as a competing risk for NRM. and death without relapse a competing
risk for relapse. Cox regression was used to assess the association of the
iBMA predicted probability with each of these time-to-event outcomes. and

the iBMA predicted probability was modeled as a continuous linear variable.
All models were adjusted for EBMT Risk Score. The impact of total white
blood cell count. blast percent and cytogenetic response on outcomes was
also modeled as a continuous variable.

3 RESULTS

In this work, we present a novel integrated iBMA algorithm that
identiﬁes robust and biologically relevant predictors by integrating
prior expert knowledge, predicted ﬁinctional relationships and gene
expression data. Prior expert knowledge is represented as a set
of reference genes that are selected independently of the gene
expression data, and consists of genes known to be associated with
the disease of interest in the literature (see Section 2.3 for details).
We make use of predicted ﬁinctional relationships represented
in the FLN (Linghu et (11., 2009). The FLN is an evidence-
weighted network (i.e. a weighted undirected graph) computed from
various functional genomics data sources and aimed to represent the
functional associations between human genes related to different
diseases, and has been used to prioritize candidate genes in various
diseases (Linghu et (11., 2009). The FLN represents universal prior
knowledge that can be used in any disease of interest.

3.1 Assessment using the microarray data

3.1.1 Prediction accuracy We applied integrated iBMA to
Classify CP versus BC patient samples in the CML progression
microarray data. We experimented with two reference gene sets,
the base and expanded set, consisting of 27 and 72 reference genes,
respectively (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), and different edge
weight thresholds. We evaluated the prediction accuracy using 3-fold
cross-validation repeated 100 times on the microarray data. Table 1
shows the average prediction accuracy using the base reference set
consisting of 27 genes. See Supplementary Table S4 for the variance
over cross-validation runs. As expected, the average degree in FLN-
sub and the number of neighbor genes connected to the reference
set decreased as we increased the edge threshold. As the number of
neighbor genes is decreased, the highly predictive genes from lower
edge thresholds might disappear, and hence, the prediction accuracy
might be reduced. As a baseline, applying iBMA to the microarray
gene expression data (without the FLN and without the reference
genes) selected an average of 12.93 genes, produced an average Brier
Score of 0.54 and an average percentage errors of 0.64%. Therefore,
the integrated iBMA method using the FLN and reference genes
produced similar prediction accuracy while selecting fewer genes
on an average.

The edge threshold log(10) produced the lowest average Brier
Score from Table 1. Using an edge threshold of log(10), we then
applied integrated iBMA to the full CML progression microarray
data (using all 72 CP and BC patient samples) and selected
six signature genes ‘base-log10’ = (RALGDS, LASPl, G6PD,
ADRBKl, LRPPRC, PSMAl) with posterior probabilities >5%.
RALGDS is represented by more than one probe on the array
platform, and two splice variants (AB037729 and AK000242) are
selected with posterior probabilities 22.3 and 15.1%, respectively.
The remaining ﬁve signature genes LASPl, G6PD, ADRBKl,
LRPPRC, PSMAl are selected with posterior probabilities 16.6,
15.1, 15.1, 13.7 and 13.7%, respectively. Figure 3 shows how these
six signature genes are connected to our reference genes in the FLN
at this threshold. Speciﬁcally, SET, SMO, SHH, RRAS2, ABLl,

reference genes (shown as small pink nodes) and weight threshold log(10)

RAD51, ALDH1A1 are in the base reference set that are also
neighbors of our signature genes. Since the reference set represents
prior knowledge (i.e. genes known to be associated with CML from
the literature), they might not be predictive in the expression data.
Hence, the reference genes are not necessarily Chosen by integrated
iBMA. SET is over-expressed in BC CML and participates in
the inhibition of differentiation seen with progression to the acute
leukemic phase of CML (Neviani et a1., 2005). SMO and SHH
are members of the sonic hedgehog pathway, which is important
in maintaining leukemia stem cells in CML (Zhao et a1., 2009),
whereas ALDHlAlis differentially expressed in acute myeloid
leukemia progenitor cells as compared to normal hematopoietic stem
cells (Stirewalt et a1., 2008). Lastly, RRAS2, ABL1 and RAD51
are associated with Bcr-Abl signaling (Melo and Barnes, 2007;
Quintas-Cardama and Cortes, 2009).

The edge threshold log(20) produced similar average Brier
Score (0.49) and even lower average percentage error (0.17%)
as the log(10) threshold, see Supplementary Figure S2. We also
experimented with an expanded reference set consisting of 72
genes, and the prediction accuracy is summarized in Supplementary
Table S5. With this expanded reference set, the numbers of neighbor
genes are higher than is the case with the base reference genes. The
log(20) and log(50) thresholds both yielded better average prediction
accuracy than iBMA without the FLN and without the reference
genes (average Brier Scores of 0.49 and 0.47, both <0.54), see
Supplementary Figures S3 and S4.

3.1.2 Stability of signature genes We showed that the
integrated iBMA algorithm using expert knowledge and ﬁinctional
relationships encoded in the FLN selected more stable signature
genes on an average over cross-validation than iBMA using the
microarray data alone. Since the numbers of genes selected vary
over different folds in cross-validation runs, we deﬁned ‘stable’
signature genes as frequently selected genes over cross-validation
(i.e. gene that are selected in at least 50 or 90% in all folds in
cross-validation runs), and quantiﬁed stability by the fraction of
‘stable’ signature genes in each fold and each run.

Using the base reference set and a weight threshold of log(10),
the average fractions of signature genes selected in at least 50 and
90% of all cross-validation runs are 0.53 and 0.29, respectively.
This is in contrast to iBMA using microarray data alone in which

The average fractions of genes are computed over 3-folds in 100 cross-validation runs.

the average fraction of signature genes selected in at least 50 and
90% of all runs are 0.24 and 0, respectively. In other words, without
the expert knowledge and FLN, iBMA did not select any signature
genes with over 90% stability in any of the 100 cross-validation runs.
However, on an average, almost 30% of signature genes selected
by integrated iBMA are highly stable, i.e. selected in at least 90%
of cross-validation runs. Supplementary Figure S5 compared the
fraction of signature genes that are selected in at least 50% of the time
in each cross-validation runs using the base reference set and log(10)
threshold. There is no Clear pattern of stability over edge weight
thresholds from Table 2. However, it is Clear that integrated iBMA
produced more stable signature genes than without using any expert
knowledge and no FLN. Note that stability over cross-validation
does not necessarily imply stability over different reference genes
or FLN edge thresholds.

3.2 Analyses of independent qPCR data

To substantiate the predictive power of our signature genes, we
proﬁled a total of 35 signature genes using qPCR in 222 patient
samples. The 35 signature genes were derived from applying
integrated iBMA to the full CML progression microarray data at
various FLN edge thresholds using both sets of reference genes. We
also proﬁled the six signature genes identiﬁed from our previous
study (Oehler et a1., 2009b) using iBMA and microarray data alone,
and we denote this gene set as previous6 = (NOB 1, DDX47, CD101,
LTB4R, SCARBl, SLC25A3). See Supplementary Methods for the
details of these 35 genes.

Most patients present in CF and far fewer patients in AP and
even fewer patients in BC. This represents the Clinical dilemma of
not having large (or equal) numbers of patient samples for these
studies. Our previous analyses showed that prediction accuracy
was generally improved when we developed prediction models
for disease phases that were more distinct (Oehler et a1., 2009b).
Therefore, as described in Methods, we assigned a patient sample
to CP-early or CP-late based on time from diagnosis (Gratwohl
et a1., 1998). Due to the small number of BC patient samples
(n = 9), the prediction accuracy of CP-early versus BC is not very
reliable. Therefore, we focused on CP-early versus AP (120 versus
23 samples). We addressed the issue of the unbalanced Class sizes
using bagging (Mitchell, 1997) (see Section 2.10 in Methods). Since
the qPCR data are on different scales than the microarray gene
expression data, we re-ﬁtted the BMA model using cross-validation.

Supplementary Table S6 showed the prediction accuracy of
various sets of signature genes Classifying CP-early versus AP

patient samples on the qPCR data. We observed that signature
gene sets determined using integrated iBMA produced comparable
prediction accuracy to the signature gene set determined using
microarray data alone (previous6). In fact, the signature genes
in expanded-log50 = (RALGDS, FKBPlA, PRKCD, AVEN, PXN,
RAC2, FGR) performed the best with average accuracy ~81%. As
our signature genes were selected from Classifying CP versus BC
patient samples on the microarray data, we did not expect prediction
accuracies as high as those shown in Table 1 when comparing
CP-early to AP.

3.3 Gene set expression in 172 CP CML patients prior
to HSCT predicts relapse after transplantation

Having identiﬁed signature gene sets that accurately classiﬁed CP
from advanced phase disease, we then tested the hypothesis that
a gene signature associated with progression when detected in CF
predicts poorer outcome. Such validation would be of signiﬁcant
Clinical relevance. Speciﬁcally, we studied the association between
the predicted probabilities computed from integrated iBMA using
each signature gene set and the Clinical outcomes (relapse) for 172
CP patients. Among these patients, 45 died and 24 relapsed by last
contact. Estimates of overall survival (1- and 5-year) were 85 and
78%, respectively, and 1 and 5-year estimates of relapse were 7 and
12%, respectively.

After adjustment for the EBMT Risk Score, which accounts
for known Clinical variables associated with outcomes, we found
the predicted probabilities computed using integrated iBMA and
expression of base-log10 = (RALGDS, LASPl, G6PD, ADRBKl,
LRPPRC, PSMA 1) when detected prior to allogeneic transplantation
had the strongest correlation with subsequent relapse after allogeneic
transplantation (see Fig. 4A). In CP patients, an increase of 0.2 in the
predicted probabilities was associated with an increase in relapse of
46% [HR = 1.46 (1.06—2.02, P = 0.02)]. Expression of the previous6
gene set also demonstrated a trend towards increased relapse after
allogeneic transplantation. An increase in predicted probability of
0.2 was associated with an increase in relapse of 23% [HR = 1.23
(0.97—1.57, P = 0.09)] (see Fig. 4B). Notably, after adjusting for the
‘previous6’ signature, an increase in the ‘base-log10’ signature was
still associated with an increase in the risk of relapse [HR= 1.38
(099—1 .91, P = 0.05) for an increase of 0.2 in the iBMA predicted
probability]. On the other hand, after adjusting for the ‘base-log10’
signature, an increase in the predicted probability of the ‘previous6’
although still associated with an increased risk of relapse, was
not statistically signiﬁcant and the magnitude of the association
was actually reduced [HR= 1.17 (0.91—1.50, P=0.23) for each
increase in 0.2 of predicted probability]. Neither gene signature was
signiﬁcantly associated with NRM, in keeping with our original
hypothesis that genes associated with progression drive resistance
to therapy rather than predicting toxicities associated with therapy.

In addition to the EBMT Risk Score, we also examined the
impact of several other Clinical variables on outcomes including total
white blood cell count and blast percentage, as well as cytogenetic
response at the time of sample draw (Supplementary Methods
and Results). None of these additional factors were statistically
signiﬁcantly associated with relapse, and adjustment for these
factors did not alter our conclusions, suggesting that these signatures
identify heterogeneity at the molecular level, rather than simply
reﬂecting burden of disease.

4 DISCUSSION

We present a novel method called integrated iBMA that incorporates
expert knowledge and predicted ﬁinctional relationships into
expression analyses to identify genes predictive of CML
progression. We showed that our method identiﬁed signature genes
associated with disease progression with high prediction accuracy.
We also showed that the signature genes identiﬁed by integrated
iBMA were relatively stable in cross-validation runs compared
to genes selected using microarray data alone. We subsequently
proﬁled selected signature gene sets from independent patient
samples using qPCR and showed that our signature genes are
predictive of CML phase progression in this independent data set.
Lastly, because therapy response is so dependent on CML phase, we
hypothesized that advanced phase gene signatures when detected in
CF CML would predict poor response. Using integrated iBMA, we
derived gene signatures that were independent molecular predictors

Predicting relapse in CML

 

of relapse after transplant that withstood adjustment for known
clinical variables associated with transplant outcomes.

In regards to the last ﬁnding, few molecular predictors have been
identiﬁed that associate with outcome. BMIl expression, and more
recently the hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index
(HCT—CI) together with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were
found to be associated with inferior survival and increased NRM
(Mohty et a1., 2008; Pavlu et a1., 2010). Our gene signatures, which
are associated with relapse, provide complementary information and
may better identify which patients require more careful monitoring
or early treatment intervention after HSCT. Lastly, because response
to all therapies in CML is so dependent on phase, we believe
these predictors may also predict outcomes on other therapies such
as TKIs.

Our proposed framework can be generalized to other predicted
ﬁinctional relationships such as HEFalMp (Huttenhower et a1.,
2009) and other variable selection methods such as the lasso
(Tibshirani, 1996). Recently, Bessarabova et a1. (2011) compared
the genetic alterations in common human cancers, and identiﬁed
common signaling pathways and transcription regulation that
underlie different genes encoded in these genetic alterations. Our
method is similar to their approach in the sense that we adopt
the FLN as universal prior knowledge for any disease of interest.
Since the expert knowledge is represented as reference genes that
are derived from the literature, these reference genes may consist
of or interact with the 65 ‘universal cancer genes’ identiﬁed by
Bessarabova et a1. Therefore, our method is ﬂexible depending on
how speciﬁc the inputs are in the form of the reference genes.

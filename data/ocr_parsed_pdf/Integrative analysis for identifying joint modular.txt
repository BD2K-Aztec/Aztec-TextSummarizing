Abstract

Motivation: The underlying relationship between genomic factors and the response of diverse can—
cer drugs still remains unclear. A number of studies showed that the heterogeneous responses to
anticancer treatments of patients were partly associated with their specific changes in gene expres—
sion and somatic alterations. The emerging large—scale pharmacogenomic data provide us valu—
able opportunities to improve existing therapies or to guide early—phase clinical trials of com—
pounds under development. However, how to identify the underlying combinatorial patterns
among pharmacogenomics data are still a challenging issue.

Results: In this study, we adopted a sparse network—regularized partial least square (SNPLS)
method to identify joint modular patterns using large—scale pairwise gene—expression and drug—
response data. We incorporated a molecular network to the (sparse) partial least square model to
improve the module accuracy via a netvvork—based penalty. We first demonstrated the effective—
ness of SNPLS using a set of simulation data and compared it with two typical methods. Further,
we applied it to gene expression profiles for 13 321 genes and pharmacological profiles for 98 anti—
cancer drugs across 641 cancer cell lines consisting of diverse types of human cancers. We identi—
fied 20 gene—drug co—modules, each of which consists of 30 cell lines, 137 genes and 2 drugs on
average. The majority of identified co—modules have significantly functional implications and coor—
dinated gene—drug associations. The modular analysis here provided us new insights into the mo—
lecular mechanisms of how drugs act and suggested new drug targets for therapy of certain types
of cancers.

The increasing amount of available high—throughput data sets at
both levels of genomic data and drug response data provide us the
opportunities for large—scale integrative analysis by computational
methods (Barretina et (11., 2012; Garnett et (11., 2012; Lamb et (11.,
2006; Shoemaker, 2006). This situation also enables us to study the

regulation. In general, drugs function in human body by binding to
their targets or altering their targets activity to perturb biological
systems (Drews, 2000; Hopkins and Groom, 2002; Penrod et (11.,
2011; Zhao et (11., 2011). Previous studies suggested that ‘one—drug—
one—target’ therapies cannot effectively treat complex diseases like

cancers which are caused by complex biological processes (Csermely
et (11., 2005; Lu et (11., 2012; Medina—Franco et (11., 2013). In other
words, drug molecules often interact with multiple targets, known
as polypharmacology (Hopkins, 2008; Paolini et (11., 2006; Reddy
and Zhang, 2013). Additionally, the same mechanism of action or
target is shared by more than one drug (Takigawa et (11., 201 1; Zhao
et (11., 2011, 2014). Actually, in clinical practice, some drug combin—
ations were adopted as valuable and promising therapies, such as
thiazide diuretics and angiotensin—converting enzyme inhibitors for
hypertension (Stanton and Reid, 2002), glyburide and metformin
for type 2 diabetes (Bokhari et (11., 2003), saracatinib and trastuzu—
mab for breast cancer (Zhang et (11., 2011,b). The multiple—to—
multiple relationships between drugs and their targets imply that it
is valuable to discover combinatorial gene—drug patterns to gain
novel insights into molecular mechanisms and examine new drug
targets for therapy.

The NCI—60 project employed an ensemble of 60 human cancer cell
lines to screen over 100 000 chemical compounds and natural prod—
ucts, which greatly facilitated the pharmacological studies (Shoemaker,
2006). However, this project only used 60 cell lines, which limited fur—
ther deep exploration. Fortunately, two large—scale pharmacogenomic
studies—Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (Barretina et (11., 2012) and
Cancer Genome Project (CGP) (Garnett et (11., 2012), published diverse
types of genomic data such as gene expression, chromosomal copy
number variation, mutation and pharmacological data across hundreds
of cell lines, which provided valuable resources to reveal gene—drug as—
sociations. Both studies adopted a multivariate variable selection tech—
nique, the elastic net method, to systematically discover genomic
markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines. However, they only
focused on uncovering genomic predictors of each drug independently
and failed to determine coherent gene—drug patterns.

In recent years, a number of integrative methods were developed
for identifying combinatorial patterns in multiple data sets for dif—
ferent purpose. For example, Chen et al. (2012) and Ma et al.
(2014) proposed singular value decomposition—based statistical
models to study the regulatory relationship between multi—dimen—
sional predictors and responses. Zhang et al. (2012) developed a
joint non—negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework and Li
et al. (2012) introduced a sparse Multi—Block Partial Least Squares
(sMBPLS) regression method to simultaneously analyze multiple
types of genomic data to identify multi—dimensional regulatory mod—
ules. In addition, network structure such as pathways and gene—gene
interactions with respect to input variables plays a complementary
role in the integrative analysis (Zhang et (11., 2007). For example, Li
and Li (2008, 2010) developed a network—constrained regularization
procedure to analyze genomic data; Ma and Kosorok (2009) and
Qiu et al. (2010) drew more attention towards pathway—based meth—
ods to identify differential gene pathways; Zhang et al. (2011a,b)
adapted a network—regularized joint NMF method to discover
miRNA—gene regulatory modules; Liu et al. (2012) designed a sparse
group Laplacian shrinkage method to integrate multiple cancer
prognosis data sets to select gene markers.

Particularly, Kutalik et al. (2008) developed the Ping—Pong
Algorithm (PPA) to identify gene—drug co—modules by combining the
gene—expression and drug—response data from NCI—60. However,
this method tends to identify co—modules relating to a very limited
number of cell lines (e.g. about 800 of all 859 identified co—modules
only cover one or two cell lines), which is unreasonable and incon—
sistent with the definition of a co—module. In addition, the sizes of
these co—modules are very large, majority of which contain thou—
sands of genes and hundreds of drugs. This makes these co—modules
impractical in clinical trials and leads to vast amounts of redundant

information. Moreover, prior knowledge on gene interactions was
not considered in this study, which could provide valuable combin—
ational signals to improve the module discovery accuracy.

In this study, we adopted a sparse network—regularized partial
least square (SNPLS) method to identify combinatorial gene—drug
co—modules by integrating gene expression and drug response
data across a set of cell lines as well as a gene interaction network
(Fig. 1). The standard partial least square (PLS) (Boulesteix and
Strimmer, 2007; Gelady and Kowalski, 1986; Rosipal and Kramer,
2006) is a class of methods for investigating the relations between
two sets of observed variables by means of maximizing the covari—
ance between their corresponding latent variables. However, it
doesn’t perform variable selection for high—dimensional phamacoge—
nomic data which makes the results lack of biological interpretabil—
ity. Hence, a few types of sparse PLS (SPLS) methods (Chun and
Keles, 2010; Le Cao et (11., 2008; Li et (11., 2012) were applied to the
genomic data. To our knowledge, there was yet no study to incorp—
orate network structure into the SPLS framework.

Here, we first proposed a SNPLS model to incorporate a gene
interaction network. Moreover, we obtained the next co—module by
subtracting the signals of a former one from the data matrices which
can overcome the redundancy problem of PPA to some extent. To
demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied SNPLS to a set of simulated
data and compared it with two typical methods: SPLS and PPA. The
results showed that SNPLS performed significantly better than SPLS
and PPA in terms of specificity and sensitivity. We also applied
SNPLS to a biological data set consisting of gene expression profiles
of 13 321 genes and drug response data of 98 anticancer drugs across
641 cell lines derived from CGP (Garnett et (11., 2012). We identified
20 gene—drug co—modules and majority of them are significantly
related to known functions, cancers, and coordinated gene—drug

associations. These gene—drug patterns provide us insights into poten—
tial drug targets and drug combinations for cancer therapy.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Data and preprocessing

We downloaded a large—scale pharmacogenomic dataset including
pairwise gene expression data and drug response data from the CGP
on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer website (http://www.
cancerrxgene.org/downloadsl) (Garnett et (11., 2012). We removed
40 drugs and 13 samples that only have a limited number of values
across samples and drugs, respectively. Finally, we centered the gene
expression and drug response data across samples, and obtained a
normalized gene expression dataset of 13 321 genes and a drug re—
sponse dataset of 98 drugs across 641 samples, which were repre—
sented in two matrices X 6 RP” and Y 6 RPM" respectively (p, n, m
represent the number of samples, genes and drugs, respectively).

We downloaded a gene interaction network from the
PathwayCommons database (http://www.pathwaycommons.org)
(Cerami et (11., 2011), which was once used by Hofree et al. (2013)
and others. This network is compiled by integrating a variety of sour—
ces about gene or protein interactions including BioGrid, HPRD,
IntAct and the NCI set of cancer specific pathways. It consists of 14
355 genes or proteins and 507 757 interactions. We filtered the genes
which were absent from our genes expression data. For any gene that
was in the input gene expression data X but not in this network, we
added it to the network as an isolated node. Finally, we obtained a
gene—gene interaction network with 13 321 genes and 262 462 inter—
actions, which were denoted as a graph G : (V,E), where V : {111,
112,- - - 44,} is the set of nodes (genes) and E : {e1,e2,---,e1} is the
set of undirected edges (interactions) in graph G.

2.2 Problem formulation

In this study, we aimed to identify coherent gene—drug co—modules
via the SNPLS by integrating the gene expression data X and drug
response data Y across a set of cell lines as well as a gene interaction
network A. The standard PLS models the relations between two sets
of variables by the covariance function, i.e.

max cov(Xg, Yd) (1)
g,d

s.t. ng : 1,de : 1.

Here, let’s denote u : Xg, v : Yd as the latent variables which
are the linear combination of n and m variables corresponding to X
and Y, respectively, g and d are also named as weight vectors. This
objective function indicates that the similarity between small blocks
of X and Y is measured by the covariance of the two latent variables
14 and 11. We can discover the corresponding blocks in X and Ywhich
have similar or coherent patterns based on the absolute values of the
optimal solutions ofg and d.

However, this method doesn’t perform variable selection and is
likely to result in poor interpretation. Chun and Keles (2010) sug—
gested to impose a sparsity penalty to the weight variables g and d
and developed a SPLS regression method, which was also extended
for multiple genomics data analysis recently (Li et (11., 2012).

g§XCOV(Xg7Yd) -/11llgll1 -/12lldll1 (2)

s.t. ng : 1,de : 1.

The SPLS produces sparse g and d, which can be used for select—
ing effective variables with better biological interpretation.

Furthermore, prior knowledge on gene interactions is very use—
ful and valuable to decipher the modular patterns among genes.
Network—based penalty has been adopted for many different appli—
cations. For example, Li and Li (2008, 2010) and Liu et al. (2012)
developed a network—constrained regularization procedure to real—
ize variable selection and regression analysis for genomic data. In
these studies, the network—based penalty is defined in the same
way as a quadratic form of the Laplacian matrix associated with
the genes interaction network. Zhang et al. (2011a) utilized pre—
dicted miRNA—gene interactions and gene—gene interactions to
define network—regularized constraints for discovering the
miRNA—gene regulatory modules. Chen et al. (2013) adopted the
phylogenetic relationships among the taxa to construct Laplacian
penalty function as before to study the association between nutri—
ent intake and human gut microbiome composition. Although the
network—based penalty functions are not completely identical, they
all enforce the tightly connected nodes (genes) in the network tend
to have more similar coefficients. Inspired by this technique, we
introduced a SNPLS model to achieve our goal. Specifically, it can
be formulated as follows:

Iggxcov(Xg7Yd)-/i1gTLg-/12llgll1 -/islldll1 (3)

s.t. ng : 1,de : 1.

where cot/(u, v) is the covariance of u and 11 (14.11 6 RP), which ap—
proximates to (uTv)/p if%2?:1 u,- : 11—72;; v,- : 0, and L is the sym—
metric normalized Laplacian matrix defined as

L : D-%(D — A)D-% : I — D-%AD-%,

where A : (a,,-)nxn is the binary or weighted adjacency matrix of the
gene—gene interaction network G, a,,- equals to 1 or a value ranging
from 0 to 1, if gene 1' and i were linked in the network and a,,-: 0,
otherwise; D : (d,-)

d,,- : 27:1 a,,-, and d,,-: 0, for 1' 9E /. The tuning parameters 21,22, 23

"X" is the degree matrix of graph G, where
control the amount of regularization for smoothness and sparsity.
When 21 : 0, the model reduces to the SPLS.

If the matrices X and Y are normalized such that each column of
X and Y is centered, the problem defined in Equation (3) is equiva—
lent to

maX ;g X Yd T 1121949“  —  (4)

M

-/12llgll1- islldlh
s.t. ng : 1,de : 1.

The objective function consists of four key terms. The first one
describes the covariance between the hidden components based on
the genes expression data X and drugs response data Y. The second
one captures the key prior knowledge which makes the connected
genes in the network likely to be placed in the same co—modules. The
last two ones enforce the sparsity of the variables g and d such that
the results will have better biological interpretation.

2.3 The SNPLS algorithm

Obviously, the objective function in Equations (3) or (4) is not con—
vex with respect to g and d. Thus, it is hard to obtain the global opti—
mal solution by means of classical algorithms. In the following, we
adopted a coordinate descent algorithm to find local maximum of
this problem by updating variables g and d alternately
(Supplementary Materials). For parameter selection, we have

9103 ‘Og JSanV uo sojoﬁuv soc} ‘Btulomcg JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'SIBanoprOJxo"sotJBuiJOJutotq/ﬁduq 11101} papacjumoq

Algorithm for SNPLS:

 

Step 1: Initialize g with the solution of Equation (1) and
u : Xg.

Step 2: Update d and g alternately.

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until convergence of u

 

adopted a 5—fold cross—validation procedure to achieve it
(Supplementary Materials). We can easily find that the computa—
tional complexity of one SNPLS iteration is O(pm + pn + n2). To
speed up the convergence of this algorithm, we employed the solu—
tion of standard PLS as the initial solution of current algorithm. We
provided this algorithm in the framework above. We implemented it
in MATLAB R2013a as an user—friendly package (http://page.amss.
ac.cn/shihua.zhang/).

2.4 Determining co—modules

The weight vectors g and d produced by the above algorithm will
guide us to identify gene—drug co—modules. The main idea is to select
the gene and drug variables with relatively large absolute values of
weight variables g and d as the members of gene—drug co—modules.
Specifically, we calculated the z—scores of g and d in the following
way:

: lxil —7

i Sx (5)

where

 

— 1 2 1 _2
x:;leiltsx:n_1Z(lxil_x)‘

Based on this transformation, we obtained two vectors g"' and
d"' and determined the co—module members if g"'(i) (or d"'(/')) was
larger than the given threshold T. Meanwhile, we updated g and d
by setting the values of g,- and di, which were not selected as the
members of a co—module be zeros. Moreover, we preferred to iden—
tify the gene—drug co—modules across certain subset of samples. To
achieve this goal, we considered the latent vectors 14ng and

and T : 2 for selecting samples.

We obtained the first gene—drug co—module after running the
SNPLS algorithm. Next, we subtracted the signal of current co—
module from the input data as follows:

3 Results

3.1 Simulation study

In this section, we evaluated the performance of SNPLS and com—
pared it with SPLS (Chun and Keles, 2010) and PPA (Kutalik et (11.,
2008) by applying them to a set of simulated data. We used the area
under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) as a measure to
evaluate the performance of different methods. We ran each method
on simulated data and repeated this procedure for 50 times
(Supplementary Materials). We calculated the average AUCs of 50
realizations about genes and drugs, respectively.

We can clearly see that SNPLS always performs better than SPLS
and PPA whenever the variables of simulated data X are independ—
ent (Fig. 2A) or correlated (Fig. 2B). In particular, when the data
noises increase, the AUC values of SNPLS decrease much slower
than the other two approaches regarding to both genes and drugs.
For the gene module discovery, SNPLS even has much better

performance, suggesting that the prior network knowledge is very
useful to discover the underlying modular signal. Thus, SNPLS is
more promising compared with SPLS and PPA for practical biolo—
gical applications.

3.2 Identifying co—modules in a pharmacogenomics
dataset
We applied SNPLS to a large—scale pharmacogenomic dataset
derived from CGP (Garnett et (11., 2012) and obtained 20 gene—
drug co—modules. The detailed lists for each co—module can be
found in Supplementary Table S1. The 20 gene—drug co—modules
cover about 30 cell lines, 137 genes and 2 drugs on average. We
found that each of the three components occurred in about one to
three co—modules (Supplementary Materials), indicating that the
20 co—modules are different with each other. We also used the
hypergeometric test to assess the degree of overlap of any two co—
modules (Supplementary Materials). As a result, only one pair of
co—modules has significant overlap (FDR <0.05). Thus, almost all
of the 20 co—modules are distinct. The co—module member genes
and drugs also exhibit highly similar patterns across the same sub—
set of samples (e.g., co—module 1 and 11 in Figs 3A and 4A and
Supplementary Materials, respectively).

When compared with random generated ones, our co—modules
demonstrate high degree of (anti—) correlation between genes and
drugs across the same subset of samples. In addition, we computed

ables by randomly selecting 160 genes, 7 drugs and 67 samples for
contrasting

the Pearson correlation coefficients between the latent variables 14
and v for all the 20 co—modules and they all show significantly high
correlations (see two examples in Figs 3B and 4B, respectively).

3.3 Co—modules reveal distinct biological relevance

To evaluate the biological relevance of the 20 co—modules, we per—
formed systematic enrichment analysis for genes, drugs and cell lines
of each co—module with known knowledge, and investigated the
drug targets, drug effector pathways or biological processes and
their connections to known tumors. Using DAVID tools (https://
david.ncifcrf.gov/) for gene enrichment analysis (Huang et (11.,
2009), we found that 12 (60%) and 11 (55%) of the gene modules
respectively have at least one significant GO biological process and
KEGG pathway (Benjamini—corrected P value < 0.05). In total,
these modules are enriched in 193 distinct GO biological processes
and 29 KEGG pathways. Among them, the most frequent biological
processes are biological adhesion, chromosome organization, cell
cycle and mitosis. The most frequently enriched KEGG pathways
are focal adhesion and cell cycle. Adhesion—related processes play
important roles in cancer progression and metastasis. For example,
cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides the trac—
tions for cell motility and invasion, which affects the metastasis of
cancer cells. Thus, the integrins, cell surface receptors to mediate
cell adhesion to ECM, have been key targets of cancer therapy for
test (Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010). Chromosome organization,
cell cycle and mitosis are three closely related processes, which all
occur in cell division and proliferation. During these processes, there
appear to be some alterations and modifications, such as genetic
variations and epigenetic events, which are likely to cause cancer
cell initiation and progression (Veltri and Christudass, 2014). We
summarized the key messages for seven co—modules (Table 1) and all
co—modules (Supplementary Table S2). Besides, the overlap of gene
sets for each pair of co—modules is provided in Supplementary
Table S3.

ID, co-module ID; #G/#D/#S, number of genes/drugs/samples; drug target, a molecule to which a given drug binds; drug effector, the biological process or path-
way which a given drug has an effect on; tumor type: the enriched tumor types in the samples.

For the drugs in each co—module, we analyzed their targets and
effector pathways or biological processes. 12 of the 20 co—modules
include more than one drug. Among 6 (50%) of these 12 drug mod—
ules, their drug members share the same targets or effector pathways
(P-value : 0.0008 by permutation test). For example, the three
drugs (CI—1040, PLX4720 and SB590885) in co—module 11 all target
ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, for samples in the 20 co—mod—
ules, we tested whether they tended to belong to the same or similar
tumor types. As a result, 13 (65%) modules are enriched in certain
tumor types (FDR < 0.05, hypergeometric test). For example, the
co—module 1 is enriched in several types of blood diseases including
lymphoblastic T—cell leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, acute mye—
logenous leukemia (AML), Burkitt lymphoma, chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML) and so on.

3.4 Co—modules reveal significant drug—gene
connections

We found that the co—modules reveal significant drug—gene connec—
tions from different angles (Table 1 and Fig. 5). We took co—module
1, 6 and 11 as examples. The co—module 1 consists of 104 member
genes with a significant number (16) of genes in the human cancer
genes census (FDR : 2.1456 X 10%, hypergeometric test), and a

significant number (6) of genes (BCOR, BLM, IKZFI, PTPRC,
SEPT6, SFRSZ) relating to leukemia (Futreal et (11., 2004).
Moreover, 8 of 12 enriched GO biological processes are about
leukocyte, lymphocyte or T cell, which are all closely related to leu—
kemia (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, the sample—enriched tumor types
exactly refer to this kind of disease, including lymphoblastic T—cell
leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, AML, Burkitt lymphoma and
CML, indicating the distinct biological relevance of the identified
co—modules. On the other hand, its two member drugs both have ef—
fects on transcription, which is a key part of cell activation. This is
consistent with the enriched biological functions: cell activation,
translational elongation and ribosome pathway which play a leading
role during transcription. As to these two drugs, methotrexate is an
antineoplastic antimetabolite with immunosuppressant properties
(Knox et (11., 2011; Law et (11., 2014; Wishart et (11., 2006, 2008). It
competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme
participating in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis, which is necessary
for synthesis of purines, thymidylate and several amino acids
(Pajagopalan et (11., 2002). Therefore, methotrexate is able to inhibit
cellular replication and was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Another drug,
ATRA, also known as tretinoin, is an important regulator of cell

Fig. 5. Two networks of three levels of genes, drugs and tumor types in co-module 1 (A) and 11 (B)

reproduction, proliferation and differentiation. It was used in the
treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (Castaigne et 41]., 1990;
Huang et 41]., 1988; Law et 41]., 2014; Sanz, 2006). Although
these two anticancer drugs were not reported to be used to treat the
sample enriched diseases together, the high degree of correlated
structure with genes enriched in crucial biological functions and
the similar drug effectors indicated their functional similarity for
leukemia. We constructed a network of three levels for co—module
1 (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Materials) to demonstrate their close
connections among genes, drugs and sample—enriched tumor types.
The drugs directly link to three cancer genes (BLM, IKZFI, WAS),
which are all associated with leukemia or lymphoma (Warde—Farley
et 41]., 2010). Moreover, the drugs are both connected with VAV1,
proteins encoded by what are important in hematopoiesis, playing a
role in T— and B—cell development and activation (Safran et 41].,
2010). In the network, VAV1 is interacting with four cancer
genes: EZHZ (related to diffuse large B—cell lymphoma), PTPRC
(related to T—cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), WAS (related
to lymphoma) and S UZIZ (related to endometrial stromal
tumor) (Futreal et al., 2004), indicating the potential of this
gene as a new drug target for treatment of lymphoma—related
diseases.

The co—module 6 consists of 134 genes with a significant number
(12) of cancer genes (FDR : 0.0041, hypergeometric test). The
genes of this co—module are mainly involved in intracellular sub—
stance transport which plays a leading role in DNA repair and repli—
cation. The two drugs exactly target these biological processes
(Table 1). Moreover, the 24 samples of this co—module are enriched
in Ewings sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (putative Ewings). One
drug AZD—2281 in this co—module, also named olaparib, is an in—
hibitor of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Brenner et a1.
(2012) reported that PARP-I inhibition could be used as a targeted
strategy to treat Ewings sarcoma. On the other hand, Lee et a1.
(2013) proposed that combing PARP-1 inhibition and radiation in
Ewings sarcoma resulted in lethal DNA damage, which increased
apoptosis and cell death and finally blocked the development of
Ewings sarcoma. More interestingly, it was reported that the com—
bination of olaparib (AZD—2281) and camptothecin could be prom—
ising to improve the clinical therapy for Ewings sarcoma comparing
with using olaparib alone (Miura et 41]., 2012).

The last example, co—module 11 exhibits distinct biological rele—
vance with malignant melanoma in terms of genes, drugs and

samples respectively. First, the 33 samples of this co—module are en—
riched in this tumor type. Second, the 160 genes of this co—module
are enriched in melanin or pigment (Fig. 4C) with two melanoma
oncogenes—CDKNZA and MITF (Futreal et al., 2004). Third, the
three drugs of this co—module affect the same pathway—ERK signal—
ing pathway, which plays a central role in the mediating growth—
promoting signals for a diverse group of upstream stimuli (Allen
et al., 2003). These three drugs target two genes: one is BRAF which
has been an attractive target for melanoma drug development
(Villanueva et 41]., 2010); the other is MEKI/Z which is one of the
key components in the ERK signaling pathway. The inhibitors of
MEK could effectively block the phosphorylation of ERK and con—
tinuous signal transduction through ERK signaling pathway,
thereby they have important clinical benefit in the treatment of can—
cers (Allen et 41]., 2003). Moreover, a V600E mutation of the BRAF
serine/threonine kinase (S/T kinase) was found occurred in >50% of
all melanoma (Puzanov and Flaherty, 2010). Combination of BRAF
and MEK inhibition in melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation, com—
paring with BRAF inhibition alone, can delay the emergence of re—
sistance and reduce toxic effects in patients, thereby improves the
rate of progression—free survival (Flaherty, 2012; Georgina et 41].,
2014). Interestingly, for co—module 11, the most significantly en—
riched mutation type is BRAF V600E (P—value:2.4e—18)
(Supplementary Table S4), which indicates the closely relationships
between drugs and melanoma samples in this co—module. We also
demonstrated the close relationships among these components in a
three—level network (Fig. 5B). Particularly for drug SB590885 and
PLX4720, they tend to link to the same genes. All these observations
demonstrated the high connections of genes, drugs and sample—
enriched tumor types in these co—modules, suggesting the effective—
ness of SNPLS for discovering biologically relevant co—modules.

3.5 Comparison with other methods

To demonstrate the effectiveness of SNPLS, we also applied SPLS
(Chun and Keles, 2010) and PPA (Kutalik et al., 2008) to the CGP
data and identified 20 co—modules, respectively. The global distribu—
tions for the number of cell lines, genes and drugs of 20 co—modules
produced by each method are very different (Supplementary
Materials). Especially for PPA, its co—modules contain a very large
number of genes and drugs, but relatively few cell lines comparing
to those of SPLS and SNPLS (i.e. on average 5 cell lines, 1281 genes

Fig. 6. Comparison of all the enriched GO biological processes of gene mod-
ules detected by SNPLS and SPLS. For each GO biological process, we
computed enrichment scores (flog10(q-value) with Benjamini-corrected
q—values) and the highest scores among all modules were taken as the final
score of this GO biological process for each method. The scores for SNPLS
were plotted against those of SPLS. Dash lines along the horizontal and
vertical directions both indicate the significance threshold. The points in the
top-left part represent the significantly enriched GO biological process exclu-
sively by SNPLS co-modules, whereas the points in the bottom-right part are
ones exclusively by SPLS co-modules. A set of representative terms are
shown. Points above the central diagonal line represent terms that are more
significantly enriched using SNPLS than SPLS, indicating that SNPLS can
identify more biological relevant gene modules than SPLS by incorporating
the prior gene network

and 23 drugs per co—module for PPA versus 31 cell lines, 128 genes
and 2 drugs for SPLS and 30 cell lines, 137 genes and 2 drugs for
SNPLS). The large size of co—modules of PPA makes it difficult to ex—
tract essential information for practical usage, and too few cell lines
in each seems unreasonable. It is hard to image to treat a set of genes
and drugs, which play similar or coherent tendency across only two
or three samples as a joint modular pattern. Moreover, among these
20 co—modules detected by PPA, 7 pairs of co—modules have signifi—
cant overlap whereas only one pair for SNPLS and two pairs for
SPLS have implying co—modules detected by PPA are very
redundant.

We also analyzed the interaction enrichment in each co—module
of SPLS and SNPLS based on the gene—gene interaction network. 14
(70%) co—modules of SNPLS are enriched with gene interactions
(FDR < 0.05), whereas only 11 (55%) co—modules of SPLS are en—
riched, indicating the strong biological relevance of co—modules of
SNPLS than those of SPLS. Actually, 14 co—modules of SNPLS are
enriched in at least one GO biological process or KEGG pathway
(Benjamini—corrected q—value < 0.05) and only 11 co—modules of
SPLS are. We also found that the enriched biological processes of
SNPLS have more significant P—value than those of SPLS, suggesting
that SNPLS indeed have improvement in identifying more biologic—
ally relevant genes (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S5). Moreover,
we applied SNPLS and SPLS to NCI60 data with a large number of
compounds and a small number of samples as used by PPA (Kutalik
et (11., 2008) (Supplementary Materials). Both methods showed very
similar performance as applied to CGP data.

4 Discussion

Deciphering the multiple—to—multiple relationships between drugs
and their targets is crucial for studying the mechanisms of drug ac—
tions and developing effective treatment for patients. Meanwhile,
the dramatic accumulation of large—scale genomic data and drug re—
sponse data from the same cell lines provides us the unprecedented
opportunities to identify gene—drug joint modular patterns to decode
these relationships from the perspective of gene regulation. In this
study, we developed a method SNPLS to integrate these two data as
well as a gene interaction network to identify gene—drug co—modules.
When compared with SPLS, SNPLS employs the network structure
as prior knowledge such that genes in each co—module tend to be
closely connected in the network, which makes such a co—module
more biologically interpretable.

We applied SNPLS to a pairwise gene—expression and drug—re—
sponse data from 641 cell lines covering a wide range of tumor types
and identified 20 gene—drug co—modules. Most of these co—modules
displayed significant functional connections from functional inter—
pretation of gene, drug and cell line views. For drug members of the
same co—module, they often have the same related targets, or have
effects on the same biological processes and pathways in some
related diseases. These observations suggested that the co—modules
can help us to find new drug combinations or similarities for treat—
ment of certain cancer or provide new drug target candidates.

We may study the following aspects to extend SNPLS in future
studies. First, we used a coordinate descend algorithm to solve the
objective function, which may be improved with more computation—
ally efficient algorithms. Second, besides using a gene interaction
network, we can also incorporate drug—drug similarities or inter—
actions to improve the accuracy of module discovery. Third, SNPLS
may be further adapted to consider the potential negative correl—
ation of two genes in the network—regularized term, i.e. taking the
sign of weight variable g into account. Finally, with the accumula—
tion of abundant data in biology and pharmacology, we can extend
this method to similar pairwise biological data for joint modular
analysis.

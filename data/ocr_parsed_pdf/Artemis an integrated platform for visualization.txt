ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies
have made low-cost sequencing of large numbers of samples
commonplace. An explosion in the type, not just number,
of sequencing experiments has also taken place including
genome re-sequencing, population-scale variation detection,
whole transcriptome sequencing and genome-wide analysis of
protein-bound nucleic acids.

Results: We present Artemis as a tool for integrated visualization
and computational analysis of different types of HTS datasets in the
context of a reference genome and its corresponding annotation.
Availability: Artemis is freely available (under a GPL licence) for
download (for MacOSX, UNIX and Windows) at the Wellcome Trust

1 INTRODUCTION

Prior to the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS),
sequencing experiments were limited by cost to the study of a
single sample or a small number of important samples. However,
the recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies (Shendure
et (11., 2008) have made it possible for researchers to quickly
and inexpensively sequence very large numbers of samples and
to conduct many new types of sequencing-based experiments. For
example, HTS has been used to study transmission using a large
number of isolates of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) on both the global and local scale (Harris et (11., 2010). It
has also been used to show that homologous recombination has led
to serotype switching and vaccine escape in a study of 240 isolates
of Streptococcus pneumoniae PMENl (Croucher et (11., 2011). HTS
has made it possible to explore population genetic variation among
human populations (1000 Genomes Project, Altshuler et (11., 2010).
We are now increasingly using it to enhance our understanding of
how genetic differences affect health and disease (Metzker, 2010).
The aim of projects, such as the UK10K (http://www.uk10k.org), is
to construct detailed catalogues of genome variations and identify
many more low-frequency variants that may be associated with
susceptibility to disease and response to pathogens, drugs and
vaccines. These applications of HTS require the identiﬁcation of

single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as insertions and
deletions. In addition to indels, HTS can be used to identify large
structural variants, such as large insertions, deletions, inversions
and duplications. Structural variations are also likely to make
an important contribution to diversity and disease susceptibility
(Walters et (11., 2010). The study of functional genomics and
quantitative gene expression studies has greatly beneﬁted from
RNA-seq experiments, which have reﬁned our understanding of
expression and signiﬁcantly improved annotation (Bruno, et (11.,
2010, Croucher and Thomson, 2010, Dajnes et (11., 2011, Lu et (11.,
2010, Mortazavi et (11., 2008).

The sheer size of the datasets from HTS experiments requires
tools to visualize, analyse, summarize and interpret these large-
scale datasets. Many new algorithms and tools have been developed
to efﬁciently process and analyse the data such as those designed
to assemble sequences into a consensus, e.g. Velvet (Zerbino and
Bimey, 2008), ABySS (Simpson et (11., 2009), map or align short
reads against a reference sequence e.g. TopHat (Trapnell et (11.,
2009), BowTie (Langmead et (11 ., 2009), BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009)
or those designed to identify sequence variations e.g. SAMtools,
GATK (DePristo et (11., 2011). However an inspection, review and
interpretation of the output by an experienced and knowledgeable
person is essential to understand the genomic context of these
datasets and can be critical to make connections between sequence
variation and biological phenomena. This of course complements
computational approaches, because a visual examination of the
results and underlying data is often the next step in order to
conﬁrm a prediction, or assess the potential functional effects in
a sequence-based experiment.

A number of new software applications have been developed
for browsing, visualizing and interpreting large-scale sequencing
datasets. Several of these have been designed speciﬁcally for the
visualization of genome sequence assemblies, including EagleView
(Huang and Marth, 2008), HawkEye (Schatz et (11., 2007) and
Tablet (Milne et (11., 2010). Other tools, such as LookSeq (Manske
and Kwiatkowski, 2009) and BamView (Carver et (11., 2010) have
been developed speciﬁcally to visualize short-read alignment data.
LookSeq is a JavaScript-based web application that displays data
stored in BAM ﬁles. BamView is an interactive Java application
that can visualize large numbers of read alignments stored in
BAM ﬁles. However, often researchers need to visualize these
read alignments in the context of genome annotation. Genome
browsers including Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV, Robinson
et (11., 2011), Integrated Genome Browser (IGB, Nicol et (11.,
2009) and GenoViewer (http://www.gen0viewer.com), have been

developed for this purpose. MagiCViewer (Hou et al., 2010) is
also capable of displaying large-scale short-read alignments in the
context of annotations. In addition, it provides a pipeline for genetic
variation detection, ﬁltration, annotation and visualization. Savant
(Fiume et al., 2010) is a genome and annotation visualization and
analysis tool.

Artemis is an established genome annotation tool (Rutherford
et al., 2000) that has been used in many genome projects to produce
and annotate bacterial e.g. Salmonella enterica (Parkhill et al.,
2001), Burkholderia cenocepacia (Holden et al., 2009) and small
and medium-sized eukaryote genomes e.g. Schistosoma mansoni,
360 Mb (Berriman et al., 2009), Plasmodium knowlesi, 23 MB (Pain
et al., 2008), respectively. However, in the HTS era the focus is
shifting away from producing reference genomes and annotation
to re-sequencing of large populations and conducting new types
of sequencing-based experiments. In this article, we show how we
have extended the Artemis platform for the visualization, analysis,
interpretation and inspection of HTS experimental datasets. Artemis
has been further developed to make this data the central focus of the
tool in the context of a reference genome. The goal for Artemis is to
make it a platform that can be used to intuitively visualize, browse
and interpret large datasets being produced by HTS experiments.
The new Artemis features include multiple sequence read views and
variant display. Artemis uniquely provides a comprehensive set of
read alignment views and has the ability to display multiple different
views of the same dataset at once to the user. This coupled with the
wide range of read alignment and variant ﬁlters available allows
users to easily customize and tailor their views for the particular
experimental dataset they are interrogating. In addition, these new
features are also available in the Artemis Comparison Tool, ACT
(Carver et al., 2005), which means datasets can be compared across
multiple genomes or assemblies. This comparison functionality is
not available within the other visualization tools.

2 RESULTS

Artemis, traditionally a genome visualization and annotation tool,
has recently been extended and enhanced with a wealth of new
features and ﬁlnctionality to support the visualization and analysis of
HTS datasets in the context of the genome sequence and annotation.

BamView was originally developed as a stand-alone application
to visualize read alignments stored as binary versions of SAM
(Sequence Alignment/Map) ﬁles and known as BAM ﬁles (Li
et al., 2009). BamView was subsequently incorporated into Artemis,
providing the ﬁlnctionality to View these read alignments in the
context of the nucleotide sequence and genomic features. Reads
can be displayed in one of ﬁve views, aimed at emphasizing
different aspects of alignments: stacked, paired-stacked, strand
stacked, inferred size and coverage view (Fig. 1). It is possible
to zoom in and View the read alignments at the nucleotide level
(Fig. 3b). Reads can be ﬁltered by their mapping quality and/or by
their SAM ﬂags. Also the panel can be Cloned, so that separate views
can be shown which is useful when comparing multiple strains for
example.

In addition, functionality has been added to display the
contents of Variant Call Format (VCF, Danecek et al., 2011)
ﬁles. VCF ﬁles are compressed and indexed with ‘bgzip’ and
‘tabix’ (Li, 2011), respectively. Alternatively binary VCF (BCF)
can be used, which are generated and indexed, using BCFtools

View, with the forward and reverse strand reads above and below the scale,
respectively.

(http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml). Variants stored in
these ﬁles are rendered in the VCF View allowing the user to
visually inspect the variant calls against the reference sequence and
annotation (Fig. 2). Artemis can access the BAM and VCF and the
associated index ﬁles from a local ﬁle system or remotely over HTTP
and FTP.

Furthermore, ﬁltering mechanisms have been added to Artemis
to allow users to ﬁlter variants in real time. The ﬁlter can be
based on the type of variant (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous,
insertions) or on the properties present in the VCF ﬁle such as read
depth and mapping quality. These variants can also be automatically
annotated according to variant type, including synonymous SNPs,
non-synonymous SNPs, insertion, deletion and multiple allele.

Fig. 2. A region of S.pneumom'ae antibiotic resistant pandemic clone
PMENl. This shows the variation data for 11 strains. The pspA gene in
the reference is a pseudogene as a result of a frame shift. The top VCF panel
shows variant and non-variant sites without ﬁltering. The VCF panel below
this shows the same region but with ﬁltering applied (i.e. minimum quality
score of 60, a minimum read depth of 5). The magenta insertions in most
strains show where this frame shift has been caused by a deletion in the
reference strain (and one of the other strains). The gene has independently
become a pseudogene in a second strain, because of an SNP leading to a
premature stop codon (as indicated by the circle in the middle of the line),
and a third strain has a recombination that spans this whole region (shown
by the increased SNP density).

Artemis can be used for the initial data exploration of HTS
datasets, cross Checking of results and for small to medium size
genomes it provides a limited set of analyses. This includes
calculation of SNP density, read counts and the reads per kilobase per
million mapped reads (RPKM, Mortazavi et al., 2008) for selected
genes. The read count results can be saved in a tab delimited format
ﬁle. These results can be used as input to DESeq (Anders and Huber,
2010), for example, for additional differential expression analysis.

Finally, to display other experimental datasets (e.g. microarray,
RNA-Seq) it now has support for user-deﬁned input types, which
can be rendered graphically as either graphs or heat maps.

In the following sections, we describe these new features in more
detail and outline how Artemis can be used in several different
HTS experiments as a platform for interrogating, analysing, and
interpreting these data.

2.1 Base pair variation

The high yield and low error rate of HTS technologies allows
genome re-sequencing to a high depth of coverage. There are
many tools available for mapping of short reads against a reference
genome, most of which provide the option to output SAM or
BAM format, which can now be opened in Artemis. In the
simplest scenario, HTS genome re-sequencing allows correction

of a reference sequence produced with older technologies, such
as capillary sequencing. Figure 3 shows re-sequencing data of a
bacterial genome. Red lines show the location of bases in mapped
reads that differ from the sequence of the reference genome.
Sequencing errors produce randomly distributed lines, while true
SNPs between the sequenced DNA and the reference genome can
be seen where lines align vertically through all of the reads mapping
across a site. In this instance, the reference can be corrected/updated.
There are tools to do this type of correction automatically e.g.
iCORN (Otto et al., 2010a). However, Artemis can be used to
visualize and conﬁrm this error by inspecting the read and mapping
qualities and BAM ﬂags of the alignments.

For the analysis of genomic variation, sequence data from a
set of isolates can be mapped against a reference genome to
identify variations that are biologically signiﬁcant. Genetic variation
can be displayed in the VCF View of Artemis. Variant ﬁles are
displayed in rows above the reference genomic annotation, with

lines representing the position of variations from the reference DNA
sequence. By default, SNP variants are colour coded according
to the variant base (Table 1), while indels are also highlighted.
However, there are alternative colour schemes. Artemis also allows
non-variant positions to be displayed, so that a lack of variation can
be distinguished from a lack of data or coverage. Figure 2 shows
how the Artemis can be used to visualize variation in 11 bacterial
isolates mapped against the reference genome (Spn23F).

2.2 Population analysis

When very large numbers of isolates are sequenced, with the
intention of identifying genetic variants at the population level, data
from all of the samples or isolates can be loaded into Artemis and
several types of analyses performed across the entire set. The VCF
view supports real-time ﬁltering of both variant and non-variant
bases, enabling the user to adjust the parameters upon which base
calls are made. For example, a user can Choose to ﬁlter variants based
on read depth or sequencing quality. Furthermore, by combining the
BamView and VCF displays, it is possible to manually crosscheck
base calls against the raw mapped reads. Filtered data can be
exported in VCF format, or the reconstructed DNA sequences
of variants can be exported in FASTA format for genes, regions
selected in the Artemis annotation track or the entire reference. This
output can then be used as input to multiple sequence alignment
and phylogenetic tree construction tools. Using their set of ﬁltered
variants, users can also conduct further analyses within Artemis such
as ranking genes based on SNP density.

2.3 Structural variation

The ability to visualize alignment of sequencing reads mapped
against a reference also allows identiﬁcation of structural variation.
Deletions relative to the reference genome can show no mapping in
the deleted region, but lack of mapping may also indicate lack of
data. Where paired-read information is available, the insert sizes of
read-pairs mapping across a deletion will be greater than expected.
Figure 4a shows how a deletion in a subset of data from the Mouse
Genomes Project (Keane et al., 2011) sequenced with Illumina
technology can be Clearly identiﬁed by visualizing read pairs in
Artemis. One strain (green) shows continuous mapping across the
entire region, which is also conﬁrmed by the coverage plot. Coverage

alignments of two strains are shown in the ‘paired stack” View with read pairs

chromosome 1 for the A/J strain. Arrows indicate the orientation of the reads.
The orange reads have an inferred fragment size of zero. These reads are the

the insertion which coincides with a drop in the coverage. (c) Reads for the

the same strain, paired-reads ﬂanking the unmapped region exhibit
an increased insertion length relative to the reference, indicated by
their position on the y-axis. Together these two observations are
strong evidence that this is a true deletion. Conversely, insertion
locations relative to the reference are manifested by the presence of
mapped reads with missing mate-pairs (i.e. reads sequenced from
the opposite end of the same sequencing template). Upstream of the
insertion only forward reads will be mapped, while downstream of

the insertion only reverse reads will map. Figure 4b shows how an
insertion relative to the mouse reference genome can be detected in
mapped Illumina data by identifying regions containing numerous
reads with unmapped mates. In the example, a Cluster of reads with
no mapped mate, shown in orange below the paired reads, sit either
side of a drop-out in mapped coverage where novel sequence has
been inserted. By selecting the option to show read orientation, it
can be seen that the unmapped reads point towards the insertion
location.

2.4 Transcriptomics

HTS technologies have also revolutionized transcriptomic analyses.
High-throughput technologies can be used to sequence CDNA to
provide information about the RNA content of a cell. Artemis allows
RNAseq data to be viewed in the context of the genome annotation,
providing useﬁll guidance for correcting gene boundaries, splice-
sites, or for identifying the location of non-coding RNA sequences.
RNAseq data also provide valuable information about relative
gene expression levels. Figure 5 shows RNAseq data from seven
time points during the lifecycle of Plasmodium falciparum can be
visualized simultaneously using the user graph heatmap View (Otto
et al., 2010b). Artemis can also report RPKM values or the number
of reads mapping against each gene.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE

Artemis is implemented in Java and packaged for ease of installation
on all major platforms (Windows, MacOSX and UNIX). It runs as
a stand-alone application and requires a Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) of at least 1.6. It uses the Picard library (http://picard
.sourceforge.net/) for accessing and manipulating BAM ﬁles. The
latest version of Artemis available for download includes all the
libraries needed to run the application.

ACT is an application for displaying pairwise comparisons
between two or more DNA sequences. It can be used to identify
and analyse regions of similarity and difference between genomes
and to explore conservation of synteny (Holden et al., 2009, Pain
et al., 2008, Parkhill et al., 2001, Peacock et al., 2007). Since ACT
is built from the components of Artemis it inherits all its features
and functionality and so also supports the HTS formats.

With the ever-increasing size of the datasets produced by HTS
experiments, effective management of resources is critical for

visualizing and analysing such datasets. The original Artemis used
a memory-based approach, where all the sequence and annotation
data was loaded into memory. Although this type of approach has the
advantage of being faster for visualization and navigation, it can be
prohibitive for viewing large datasets as it is limited by the amount of
memory available. To overcome this, a key focus of the new Artemis
has been on developing it to handle larger datasets. To achieve this,
Artemis now supports indexed ﬁle formats. In addition to support
for indexed FASTA ﬁles, Artemis displays data contained in BAM,
BCF and compressed and indexed VCF ﬁles. This has the advantage
that the data can reside on disk and only the current visible region
needs to be held in memory, thus reducing the amount of memory
required and allowing Artemis to efﬁciently display large vertebrate
genomes (Fig. 4).

Artemis has been optimized to minimize its memory
requirements. However with the implementation of the indexed
FASTA reader in Artemis, the memory requirement is much less
(Table 2). It is also faster at opening up as it does not read the entire
sequence. There is still an increase in memory with an increase in
sequence size because of a cache used to record stop codon positions.
The caching mechanism has been further optimized to reduce the
memory needed.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have described Artemis, an integrated genome
visualization and analysis platform for HTS datasets. We have
presented several example datasets and discussed the role of Artemis
in their visualization and interpretation. Further examples are
available on the Artemis website http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/
software/artemis/ngs/.

Artemis has support for various stande ﬁle formats including
BAM and VCF, in addition to user-deﬁned input ﬁles. These formats
can support data from many different types of sequencing platforms.
Therefore, Artemis has the potential to visualize and investigate
sequencing data from numerous sequencing technologies.

The new views available within Artemis are easily customizable
by the user and can be viewed at different levels of resolution.
Multiple BAMs and VCFs can be loaded simultaneously for
comparison. This allows in-depth preliminary analysis and
investigations of HTS datasets in the context of the sequence and
annotation of a reference to reveal biologically relevant information.

Using indexed ﬁles (BAM, VCF, BCF and FASTA) means that
Artemis can efﬁciently manage memory by only needing to load into
memory the data that is currently being displayed in the interface.
This improves the performance and enables large genomes to be
viewed and interpreted along with large HTS datasets.

sequence, an indexed FASTA ﬁle and after further optimization of the stop
codon cache

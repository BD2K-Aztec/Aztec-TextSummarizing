Abstract

Motivation: Predicting the structure of protein loops is very challenging, mainly because they are
not necessarily subject to strong evolutionary pressure. This implies that, unlike the rest of the pro—
tein, standard homology modeling techniques are not very effective in modeling their structure.
However, loops are often involved in protein function, hence inferring their structure is important
for predicting protein structure as well as function.

Results: We describe a method, Looping, based on the Random Forest automated learning
technique, which, given a target loop, selects a structural template for it from a database of loop
candidates. Compared to the most recently available methods, Looplng is able to achieve similar
accuracy for short loops (4—10 residues) and significant enhancements for long loops (11—20 resi—
dues). The quality of the predictions is robust to errors that unavoidably affect the stem regions
when these are modeled. The method returns a confidence score for the predicted template loops

 

and has the advantage of being very fast (on average: 1 min/loop).

1 Introduction

The functional characterization of proteins is an important and, at
the same time, challenging problem in biology. The annotation task
can be facilitated by the knowledge of the three—dimensional (3D)
structure of the protein of interest and of its complexes (Holtby
et (11., 2013). However, determining a protein 3D structure experi—
mentally is an expensive and time—consuming task. As a result, the
number of experimentally solved protein structures is very small
compared to the number of available protein sequences. However,
this situation is changing and homology modeling is currently mak—
ing structural information available for a large number of proteins
(Schwede, 2013). Structurally speaking, proteins consist of elements
of secondary structure (alpha helices and beta strands) connected by
loops. These often play important functional roles and frequently
interact with other biomolecules. Although they might adopt differ—
ent conformations and/or be ﬂexible, especially when located on the

surface (Eyal et (11., 2005), it is still the case that they often adopt a
specific conformation and are well defined in X—ray crystallographic
structures. In terms of sequence composition, loops are the most
variable parts of proteins and tend to be more frequently subject to
insertions, deletions and substitutions than secondary structure re—
gions. Consequently, the accuracy of loop structure prediction by
template—based methods is generally lower than that of other regions
(Venclovas et (11., 2003). On the other hand, the most variable re—
gions within a family of evolutionary related proteins are often those
determining the protein specificity (Fetrow et (11., 1998; Jones and
Thornton, 1997; Kick et (11., 1997; Russell et (11., 1998).

Similarly to the prediction of the whole protein structure, loop
modeling methods can be categorized into two main groups.

Ab-im'tio loop structure prediction is generally based on the ex—
ploration of different loop conformations in a given environment,
guided by minimization of a selected energy function (Bruccoleri

and Karplus, 1990; Felts et (11., 2008; Finkelstein and Reva, 1992;
Fiser et (11., 2000; Higo et (11., 1992; Jacobson et (11., 2004; Mattos
et (11., 1994; Rapp and Friesner, 1999; Spassov et (11., 2008; Xiang
et (11., 2002). Some of the most recent methods in this category in—
clude LEAP (Liang et (11., 2014) and DiSGro (Tang et (11., 2014).
LEAP starts by generating the backbone conformations of the target
loop using the cyclic coordinate descent ‘CCD’ algorithm
(Canutescu and Dunbrack, 2003), and then selects and optimizes
them using the OSCAR energy function. The side chains for the se—
lected backbone structures are built using the OSCAR side—chains
prediction tool, then optimized and selected according to a com—
bined energy of the OSCAR potential for ﬂexible side—chains rota—
mers and CHARMM bond energies. On the other hand, DiSGro
samples loop conformations using a distance—guided sequential
chain growth Monte Carlo sampling strategy and ranks the gener—
ated conformations with an energy function specifically designed for
loops.

Template—based techniques provide a 3D model for a target loop
based on sequence and stem geometry similarity with respect to can—
didate template loops (Browne et (11., 1969; Deane and Blundell,
2000; Deane and Blundell, 2001; Marti—Renom et (11., 2000). The
stems/anchors are defined as the main—chain atoms of the residues
that precede and follow the loop. Usually many different alternative
conformations that fit the stem residues are selected and sorted ac—
cording to geometric criteria or to the sequence similarity between
the template and target loop sequences. According to Choi and
Deane (2010), template—based modeling, such as FREAD, can per—
form better than ab-initio methods, such as MODLOOP (Fiser
et (11., 2000), PLOP (Jacobson et (11., 2004) and RAPPER (de Bakker
et (11., 2003), in two—thirds of the cases involving short loops and in
half of the cases for longer loops (tested on the FREAD benchmark
dataset, see Methods). FREAD is based on the assumption that se—
quence similarity (measured by Environment Specific Substitution
Scores) along with the stem distance similarity may be used to pre—
dict the backbone structure of a target loop with reasonable accur—
acy. An updated version of the FREAD method, using a stricter
sequence similarity cut—off, has been recently developed (Choi and
Deane, 2010). This led to an improvement in performance with re—
spect to the original method, but at the expense of a lower coverage
(e.g. the coverage for loops of length 8 is roughly 60%). Another
interesting template—based modeling approach is called LoopWeaver
(Holtby et (11., 2013). This uses multidimensional scaling to place
the template loop (selected from a database of protein structures on
the basis of the stem distance similarity) followed by ranking on the
basis of the DFIRE energy function (Zhou and Zhou, 2002).

In a recent work (Messih et (11., 2014), we used a Random Forest
model to select templates for the third hypervarable loop of im—
munoglobulins, a rather elusive prolem so far. Motivated by the
good results obtained in that case, we extended the approach to the
general loop prediction problem by developing a method that takes
advantage of both sequence and geometry related features (e.g. loop
sequence, sequence similarity, stem distance, stem secondary struc—
ture and stem geometry). These features are used as input to a
Random Forest (RF) machine learning regression model trained to
select the loop template with the lowest predicted distance from the
target loop among a list of putative ones.

We tested the performance of the LoopIng method on a bench—
mark containing the target proteins of the CASP10 experiment
(Moult et al., 2014). This dataset is considered rather challenging
due to the fact that CASP10 proteins are enriched with irregular
structures, multi—domain and multi—subunit proteins, representing
less standard versions of known folds (Kryshtafovych et (11., 2014;

Moult et (11., 2014). To compare our results with those of the LEAP
method, we also tested the method on a benchmark used for the as—
sessment of both template—based and ab-im'tio loop structure predic—
tion methods in (Choi and Deane, 2010).

We show here that LoopIng performs well, better than DisGro
and LoopWeaver and, for loops longer than nine residues, than
LEAP as well.

Importantly, the described method requires substantially less
computing time with respect to other loop prediction methods (on
average 1 min/loop).

The LoopIng tool that, given the PDB file of a protein structure
or model and the amino acid sequence of the loop to be modeled,
provides an ordered list of putative templates in output is publicly
available at: www.biocomputing.it/looping.

2 Methods

2.1 Datasets

The training dataset consists of proteins the structures of which
have been solved by X—ray crystallography with a resolution 3 3A
and R—factor S 0.2. Proteins were filtered using the PISCES web ser—
ver (Wang and Dunbrack, 2003) to remove proteins with chain se—
quence identity 2 90% to each other. The resulting number of non—
redundant proteins is 15270 (derived from the PDB database on
July 1, 2014). Loops were identified as the regions between two sec—
ondary structure elements defined according to DSSP (Kabsch and
Sander, 1983). Very short (shorter than four residues) and very long
(longer than 23 residues) loops were discarded. Loops with sequence
identity260% to any other loop were excluded using the cd—hit
suite (Huang et (11., 2010) as suggested in Fernandez—Fuentes and
Fiser (2006), even though other methods such as FREAD and
LoopWeaver use a less stringent cut—off.

In addition, we also excluded any protein with a chain sequence
identity 2 90% and any loop with sequence identity 2 60% to any
of the members of our test datasets (described below). The total
number of loops satisfying the constraints was 139 849 and these
were used as training dataset. The final number of non—redundant
training loops is shown in Figure 1. These loops also constitute the
template database.

For testing purposes, we selected two publicly available datasets,
namely CASP10 (Moult et (11., 2014) and FREAD (Choi and Deane,
2010). Both have been used for the assessment of template—based
and template—free modeling methods. The CASP10 dataset contains
84 target structures, filtered based on resolution 3 3 A, protein chain
sequence identity 3 90% and loop sequence identity 3 60%. The
final number of non—redundant protein loops was 407 (from 61 pro—
teins). The FREAD benchmark, taken from (Choi and Deane, 2010)
contains 30 targets for each loop length (from 4 to 20 residues). For
this test set, we compared our approach performance with the result
reported in (Choi and Deane, 2010).

2.2 Stem geometry

It has been shown (Lessel and Schomburg, 1999) that the stem struc—
ture has the largest effect on the accuracy of loop prediction, there—
fore we also computed, for each loop, the geometrical features of its
stems. In particular, we calculated the stem distance D (the Cat dis—
tance between the residue that precedes and the one that follows the
loop), the stem type (the secondary structure of the stems), and the
stem geometry. The latter can be described by three angles (Oliva
et al., 1997) (Fig. 2): the Hoist angle (5), i.e. the angle between the
first vector representing the secondary structure (M1) and the dis—
tance vector (D); the Packing angle (0), i.e. the angle between the
two vectors (M1 and M2) representing the secondary structures
embracing the loop and, finally, the Meridian angle (p) that is the
angle between the vector M2 and the plane P perpendicular to the
plane defined by vectors M1 and D.

2.3 Loop clustering

For each loop length, we first grouped the loops into three clusters
according to their stem distance (the stem distance is defined as the
Cot—distance between the residues that precede and follow the loop).
Clustering was performed using the k—means clustering algorithm
implemented in R (k—means package).

2.4 Candidate loops

Given a loop L, we define its ‘candidate loops’ as all the loops L, in
the same cluster of the target loop that satisfy at least one of the fol—
lowing criteria:

i. The BLOSUM62 score of the alignment of L and L, is positive

ii. ()5 — 5i (ﬁn/4 and )0 — 0i) STE/4 and lp — pi) STE/4 where (5, 0,
and p) and (51, 0;, and m) are the stem angles of the L and Li
loops, respectively

The value n/4 was chosen since it has been shown (Marti—Renom
et al., 1998) that this is the expected maximum difference between
two similar loops.

2.5 Random forest model
We followed a procedure similar to the one that we successfully
applied to the prediction of the structure of the antibody H3 loops
(Messih et al., 2014). We used the R (v.4.6) implementation of the
RF (randomForest package) and the RF regression tool to predict
the distance (RMSD) between pairs of protein loops.

The input features of the RF models are, for each pair of loops,
the BLOSUM similarity scores (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) for
each aligned residue, the sum of the BLOSUM scores over the whole

sequence, the stem distance, the stem secondary structure, the stem
geometry and the stem geometry difference between the two loops.
The task of the model is to predict the RMSD between each loop
and its candidate loops. Figure 3 shows the training scheme of the
LoopIng procedure. In practice, for each loop of a cluster, we meas—
ure its pairwise RMSD with each of its candidate loops. Once all the
loops of the cluster have been processed, a Random Forest model is
built for each cluster.

For testing, given a query loop, we first assign it to the appropri—
ate cluster based on its length and stem distance. We next select the
corresponding candidate loops and use the appropriate LoopIng
model to predict the RMSD distance between the query loop and
each of its candidate loops. The candidate loop with the minimum
predicted RMSD to the query loop is selected as the best template
loop.

Supplementary Figure S1 shows the input features sorted accord—
ing to their importance in terms of average Mean Decrease Gini
values.

2.6 Model building

The modeled structure of the loop is obtained via MODELLER with
default parameters (Sali and Blundell, 1993) using the loop with the
closest predicted RMSD to the input loop as template. The accuracy
of a loop prediction is measured by the backbone RMSD of the pre—
dicted and native loops after superimposition of the stems.

3 Results
3.1 Model performance on the CASP10 dataset

Table 1 shows the average performance of the LoopIng method on
the CASP10 dataset and the comparison with DisGro and
LoopWeaver approaches [using default parameters settings as speci—
fied in (Holtby et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014)], respectively.
Overall, LoopIng was able to achieve an average backbone RMSD
of 1.29: 1.07A with statistically significant improvements over
DisGro for 8 out of 10 loop length groups. In about half of the cases,
LoopIng was able to find a template loop closer than 1  with re—
spect to the native loop, achieving a better or significantly better

(y-axis) for each loop length group (values inside the bubbles)

(ARMSD 2 1 A) accuracy than DiSGRO in 73 and 44% of the cases,
respectively.

Compared to LoopWeaver, LoopIng was able to achieve a better
or significantly better (ARMSD 2 1A) accuracy in 71 and 31% of
the cases, respectively. It is worth noticing that the difference in per—
formance of the two methods increases as the loop length increases.

By and large, the quality of comparative modeling depends on
two factors: the availability of reliable template structures and the
extent of structural similarity between target and template, which in
turn is determined by the extent of the similarity between their se—
quences (Chothia and Lesk, 1986). In line with this reasoning, we
wanted to analyse how much the sequence similarity of the target
with the available template loops inﬂuences the LoopIng results.

Figure 4 shows the average sequence identity between the loops
selected by LoopIng and the target loops and the resulting average
RMSD values for the CASP10 benchmark for each loop length
group. It can be noticed that the method performance is related to
the average local sequence identity between the target loop and the
selected template. For example, the average RMSD for loops of
length 12 (1.8 i 1.65 A) is lower than that obtained for loops of
length 11 (2.38 i 1.4 A) (Table 1) and this is likely due to the fact
that the average target—template sequence identity for loops of length
12 (28%) is higher than that for loops of length 11 (20%) (Fig. 4).

Sequence similarity is not the only factor affecting the LoopIng
accuracy. Indeed the average backbone RMSD between the LoopIng
models and the native conformations also varies with the number of
available template loops in the different training set. This impacts
more on the performance for long loops (more than 10 residues)
since, as it can be appreciated from Figure 1, a much smaller number
of training loops are available in this range. This, on the other hand,
also implies that the performance of the LoopIng method is likely to
improve as the number of available structures increases.

3.2 Model performance on the FREAD benchmark

The benchmark of the FREAD method contains 30 targets for each
loop length, (from 4 to 20 residues) and a recent assessment using
this benchmark (Choi and Deane, 2010) has shown that template—
based methods such as FREAD can achieve better performance com—
pared to the ab-im'tio loop modeling methods such as MODLOOP,
RAPPER and PLOP on this benchmark. A more recent work (Liang
et al., 2014) has shown that the ab-im'tio method LEAP is able to
achieve significant improvements over all the other tested methods
on the FREAD benchmark.

We therefore tested the performance of LoopIng on the same
benchmark and show here the comparison of its results with those
of FREAD and LEAP (Table 2). The full comparison between
LoopIng and the other methods assessed on the FREAD benchmark
is shown in Supplementary Table S2.

The LoopIng results show statistically significant improvements
in average accuracy over the FREAD method for all loop lengths
(Table 3). For loops of length between 8 and 20 residues, the aver—
age improvement is more than 1  It should be mentioned that the
reported FREAD data are taken from a relatively old paper (Choi
and Deane, 2010) and this can of course affect its performance.

Furthermore, Choi and Deane (2010) showed that the perform—
ance of FREAD can be enhanced by setting a much stricter similarity
threshold. However, this choice results in a much lower coverage es—
pecially for loops longer than eight residues (coverage < 60%).
Compared to this modified version of FREAD, LoopIng still shows
an improvement for short and medium length loops while FREAD
reaches higher accuracy for longer loops, although the coverage is
lower than 50% in these cases (Supplementary Table S3).

For each length range the number of tested loops is 30. The columns report
the average and standard deviation RMSD values measured between the model
and native loop backbone conformations. Asterisks indicate statistically signiﬁ-
cant differences (95 % conﬁdence level) based on an unpaired t—test with respect
to the LoopIng model. Underlined values represent the best results between
LoopIng and LEAP. The values reported in the FREAD and LEAP columns are
taken from Choi and Deane (2010) and Liang et al. (2014), respectively.

The accuracy of LEAP and LoopIng on the FREAD benchmark
is very similar. Notably, LEAP is more accurate for short loops
(from 4 to 9 residues) while LoopIng seems to work better
(ARMSD 2 1 A) for longer loops (Table 2). It is worth noticing that
the LoopIng method is rather fast, it takes on average 1 min/loop
(CPU speed: 2.5GHz and RAM: 2 GB) to be compared with an
average running time of 10 h/loop for the LEAP method.

It would have been interesting to compare LoopIng and LEAP also
on the CASP10 benchmark, but this turned out to be unfeasible since
the LEAP results are only available for a limited subset of the targets
(namely 21), the definition of the loops seems to be different and only
the median accuracy is provided by the authors (Liang et al., 2014).

3.3 Model performance on non—native protein
structures

Both LoopIng and other template—based methods (i.e. FREAD,
LoopWeaver) use the stem distance as a filtering step to select the
top template loop(s) from a database of known structures.
However, in a more realistic setting, the native structure of the re—
maining part of the protein is usually unknown, and the loop is built
on the basis of a modeled structure. In these cases, the stem structure
is very likely to be affected by errors. We tested to which extent this
affects the accuracy of LoopIng.

To do so, we downloaded the best model submitted to CASP10
[according to the GDT—TS measure (Huang et al., 2014)] for each tar—
get protein. If there was more than one, we selected the model with the
lowest C06 RMSD. Only modeled structures with GDT—TS score 2 50
are considered for this test set to ensure that the models were based on
a detectable and appropriate template (Kinch et al., 2011). This re—
sulted in a dataset of 130 non—redundant loops (Table 3).

Table 3 illustrates the difference in performance, in terms of
backbone RMSD between the model and native loop, when the

Effect of Stem error on Looping performance

 

Fig. 5. Model performance using native and modeled protein structures from
CASP10 dataset. The stem distance error (x-axis) is calculated as the differ-
ence in stem distance between the modeled and native stem structures. The
RMSD error (y-axis) is calculated as the difference in backbone RMSD be-
tween Looplng2Native and LoopIng2Model

native structure or the model is used. The performance is very simi—
lar as the mean RMSD values are 0.97 i 0.80 and 1.1 i 0.75 A, re—
spectively. In 55% of the cases the two predictions (using the native
structure and the modeled one) selected almost identical loop tem—
plate (RMSD S 0.1 A) with respect to the native loop conformation.

The difference in performance between using the native
(LoopIng_Native) and modeled (LoopIng_Modeled) structure for
the rest of the protein is shown in Figure 5 as a function of the
stem distance error. The LoopIng model shows similar performance
(3 1 A) when using the native and the modeled structure when the
stem distance error is lower than 2.0 

4 Conclusions

We describe here a new template—based method for predicting the struc—
ture of protein loops, a complex, yet critical, problem that is considered
one of the bottlenecks for accurately predicting protein structures.

The method was able to achieve significant enhancements over
other available methods both template—based (i.e. LoopWeaver and
FREAD) and ab-initio (i.e. DiSGRO) with an average improvement
of the backbone RMSD close to 1  It was also able to achieve com—
parable results to those of the LEAP method with a running time
orders of magnitude faster.

The quality of the predictions is not dependent upon the fine de—
tails of the stem geometry, indicating that the method is robust to
errors that unavoidably affect these regions when they are modeled
rather than taken from the native structure.

Our analysis also suggests that combined methods (ab-initio and
template—based) might be worth investigating. Short loops are

efficiently modeled using rib-initio methods (i.e. LEAP) due to the
small number of degrees of freedom, which permits an adequate ex—
ploration of the conformational space, while long loops are more ef—
fectively predicted using template—based methods (i.e. LoopIng).

We believe that the method can be a useful addition to the pres—
ently available protein structure prediction tools and could be effect—
ively and easily integrated in comparative modeling pipelines.

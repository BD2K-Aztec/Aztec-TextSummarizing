ABSTRACT

Summary: Drug side effects are one of the main health threats world-
wide, and an important obstacle in drug development. Understanding
how adverse reactions occur requires knowledge on drug mechan-
isms at the molecular level. Despite recent advances, the need for
tools and methods that facilitate side effect anticipation still remains.
Here, we present IntSide, a web server that integrates chemical and
biological information to elucidate the molecular mechanisms under-
lying drug side effects. IntSide currently catalogs 1175 side effects
caused by 996 drugs, associated with drug features divided into
eight categories, belonging to either biology or chemistry. On the bio-
logical side, lntSide reports drug targets and off-targets, pathways,
molecular functions and biological processes. From a chemical view-
point, it includes molecular fingerprints, scaffolds and chemical enti-
ties. Finally, we also integrate additional biological data, such as
protein interactions and disease-related genes, to facilitate mechanis-
tic interpretations.

Availability and implementation: Our data and web resource are
available online (http://intside.irbbarcelona.org/).

1 INTRODUCTION

Side effects (SEs) are defined as non-therapeutic, generally un-
desired, phenotypic responses to drug treatment. They affect
around 2 million patients per year in the USA, ranking the
fourth cause of death (Giacomini et al., 2007). Anticipating
SEs before launching a drug to the market is crucial for reducing
health risks, as well as costs and time during drug development.
To address this issue, many databases and tools have ﬂourished.
For instance, the Food and Drug Administration developed the
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) that contains adverse
reactions and medication error reports. Another major SEs re-
pository is Side Effect Resource (SIDER) (Kuhn et al., 2010),
which collects information on marketed medicines and their SEs
recorded in package labels.

The wealth of information in these repositories has enabled
systematic studies on SEs permitting, for instance, the computa-
tional inference of unknown drug targets (Campillos et al., 2008;

Cheng et al., 2013). However, most studies are not able to cap-
ture complex or unspecific events, which are often directly related
to the drug structure and reactivity (Williams and Park, 2003).
The association between drug structure and its activity has
indeed been used in predictive toxicology (Sushko et al., 2012).
Yet, available resources offer very broad phenotypic categories
and are not able to discriminate among the great variety of SEs.

The emerging picture is that drug SEs are the result of the
interaction of small molecules with complex biological systems
(Bai and Abernethy, 2013), requiring an integration of chemical
and biological details that, unfortunately, is not conducted in
most studies. Very recently, we presented a top-down approach
to identify chemical and biological drug features that might be
involved in the development of adverse drug reactions (Duran-
Frigola and Aloy, 2013). We delimited the chemical and biolo-
gical space for each compound by gathering molecular properties
from major biomedical resources, and carried out an enrichment
analysis associating more than 1000 SEs with molecular features.
Here, we present a web server, named IntSide, which automates
this analysis and enables a quick and easy access to our findings.
Moreover, we further integrate additional biological informa-
tion, such as protein interactions and disease-related genes, to
facilitate mechanistic interpretations. As a result, IntSide pro-
vides a complete catalog of proteins, cellular processes and chem-
ical structures that may lead to undesired responses to drug
treatments.

2 IntSide DESCRIPTION

IntSide contains drug traits classiﬁed into eight groups represent-
ing different levels of biological and chemical details (Fig. 1A).
Within the biological features, we consider therapeutic drug tar-
gets, protein interactors (i.e. drug targets and off-targets), path-
ways, biological processes and molecular functions. In addition,
we represent drug chemical traits such as small molecular de-
scriptors, scaffolds and structural terms. We applied the strategy
presented in Duran-Frigola and Aloy (2013) to identify over-
represented molecular features among drugs causing an SE.
We deﬁned as ‘over-represented’ a feature signiﬁcantly more pre-
sent in drugs causing the SE compared with the background set
of drugs (see Supplementary Material). In an updated dataset,
we detected enrichment signals for 1175 SEs. For 56% of the
SEs, we found both biological and chemical traits, while 38%
and 6% were only associated with biological or chemical char-
acteristics, respectively. In addition, using protein networks,

enrichment analysis. (B) The target network page for ‘weight increased’. Users can modify the query by specifying a drug or by adding SE(s).
Characteristics of drugs with over-represented features can be explored through the top-right panel. The ‘Include’ section enables the ﬁltering of
nodes. The ‘Percentage of related drugs’ bar indicates the number of SE-related drugs annotated with features in the network over the total number

of SE-related drugs

we connected drug receptors with disease-related genes by map-
ping SEs to diseases based on common phenotypes.

We designed a web server interface that allows a quick and
intuitive access to our data and results. Users can explore up to
three SEs at the same time and, as output, the server produces
different networks displaying the common signiﬁcant biological
and chemical features associated to each SE (Fig. 1B). In the case
of ‘targets’ and ‘proteins’ networks, non-associated proteins
(target proteins without strong statistical association with the
SE) and disease-related genes are also included, provided they
are connected to an associated protein by a path 52 in the binary
interactome (Fig. 1B). Users can also specify a drug that causes
the SE(s) of interest, reducing the network to features belonging
to that drug.

These networks allow for inferring complex mechanisms re-
sponsible for an SE, which is valuable since drugs rarely disturb a
single target. They interact, intendedly or not, with a set of pro-
teins involved in diverse biological pathways and physiological
functions, which are eventually related.

3 CONCLUSIONS

IntSide provides information to unravel the molecular mechan-
isms underlying drug SEs. Compared with other resources, our
web server offers faster and more straightforward access to bio-
logical and chemical features that are likely related to SEs of
interest. In particular, IntSide includes the human interactome
and disease-related genes, facilitating the conception of mechan-
istic hypotheses. As SEs may be caused by several factors, net-
work integration and Visualization allow for the identification of
complex mechanisms.

Unfortunately, the applicability of IntSide is currently limited
by data availability in public repositories. We anticipate that

ongoing efforts to increment clinical and pharmacological re-
ports will improve the coverage and accuracy of our results.

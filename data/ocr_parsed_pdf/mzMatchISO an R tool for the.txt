isotope-labelled LCiMS data to generate plots and tables that
describe the labelling pattern in detail.

The ability to generate a comprehensive graphical visualiza-
tion of the output along with the extensible and scriptable nature
of the software itself makes szatchiISO a unique data analy-
sis tool for isotope-labelling studies. szatchiISO is an exten-
sion to szatch. an open-source Java toolbox for MS data
processing and visualization (Scheltema ()1 al.. 2011). Features
of szatchﬂnabled by the R package szatch.Riincluding
the new PeakML data exchange format and the data analysis
pipeline were described by Scheltema ()1 a]. (2011). szatch has
been applied to many metabolomics data analyses (Jankevics
()1 al.. 2011: t’Kindt ()1 al.. 2010) and is the underlying platform
for software such as IDEOM (Creek ()1 al.. 2012). Currently. only
LCiMS data analysis is supported by szatchiISO: however. it
is possible to process gas chromatographyimass spectrometry
data analyses using mzmatch.R and mzmatchiISO with some
additional scripting.

2 METHODS
lsotopc profiling using szatchilSO rcquircs thc LCiMS raw data
(.szML) filcs to bc prcproccsscd by cxtracting thc pcaks using XCMS
(Smith ()1 (11.. 200(3) and aligning. noisc filtcring and gap—filling pcaks into a
combincd PcakML filc containing all samplcs using szatch.R. In add—
ition to thc PcakML filc. targctcd profiling rcquircs an additional tab—dc—
limitcd input tcxt filc containing thc list of compounds of intcrcst (scc
Supplcmcntary Fig. $2). This list can also contain charactcristic adducts
or fragmcnts of mctabolitcs of intcrcst whcrc appropriatc. Automatcd
targctcd and untargctcd isotopc profiling can bc pcrformcd using thc
szatchilSO functions PcakML.lsotopc.Targcttcdlsotopcs() and
PcakML.lsotopc.Untargcttcdlsotopcs(). rcspcctivcly. Thc lattcr can bc
uscd for profiling global labcl distribution by looking for thc isotopcs of
all idcntificd pcaks in a PcakML filc; or all compounds in databascs such as
thc Kyoto Encyclopcdia ochncs and Gcnomcs (KEGG) (Kanchisa ()1 al..
2012) or thc Human Mctabolomc Databasc (HMDB) (VVishart ()1 al..
2009); or using common mctabolic transformations rccursivcly. as
dcscribcd in Brcitling ()1 (11. (200(3). Gipson ()1 a]. (2008). Rogcrs ()1 a].
(2009) and chcr and Viant (2010). All paramctcrs uscd in thcsc functions
arc dcscribcd at http: mzmatch.sourccforgc.nct isotopcs—targcttcd.php.

3 RESULTS

The automated untargeted isotope annotation and relative
quantiﬁcation capabilities of szatchiISO are demonstrated
by the analysis of LCiMS data from procylic form
T rypanosoma brucei grown on ~50% uniformly 13C—labelled glu—
cose medium for 5 days. The plot in Supplementary Figure S3
generated from the tab—delimited output ﬁle (data are provided
in Supplementary ﬁle S4, and the scripts are available on the
website) highlights the capabilities of szatchiISO in demon—
strating a complex biological phenomenon.

szatchiISO provides an efﬁcient and user—friendly output
for the analysis and compact visualization of isotope—labelled
metabolomics datasets without the need for specialist bioinfor—
matics skills, allowing rapid, precise and meaningful biological
interpretation. The algorithm can be implemented directly in R,
or from the IDEOM graphical user interface, to facilitate follow—
up statistical processing, analyses and re—plotting of the results.

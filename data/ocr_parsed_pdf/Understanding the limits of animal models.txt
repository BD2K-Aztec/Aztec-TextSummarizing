ABSTRACT

Motivation: Inferring how humans respond to external cues such as
drugs, chemicals, viruses or hormones is an essential question in
biomedicine. Very often, however, this question cannot be addressed
because it is not possible to perform experiments in humans. A rea-
sonable alternative consists of generating responses in animal models
and ‘translating’ those results to humans. The limitations of such
translation, however, are far from clear, and systematic assessments
of its actual potential are urgently needed. sbv IMPROVER (systems
biology verification for Industrial Methodology for PROcess
VErification in Research) was designed as a series of challenges to
address translatability between humans and rodents. This collabora-
tive crowd-sourcing initiative invited scientists from around the world
to apply their own computational methodologies on a multilayer
systems biology dataset composed of phosphoproteomics, transcrip-
tomics and cytokine data derived from normal human and rat
bronchial epithelial cells exposed in parallel to 52 different stimuli
under identical conditions. Our aim was to understand the limits of
species-to-species translatability at different levels of biological
organization: signaling, transcriptional and release of secreted factors
(such as cytokines). Participating teams submitted 49 different solu-
tions across the sub-challenges, two-thirds of which were statistically
significantly better than random. Additionally, similar computational
methods were found to range widely in their performance within the
same challenge, and no single method emerged as a clear winner
across all sub-challenges. Finally, computational methods were able
to effectively translate some specific stimuli and biological processes
in the lung epithelial system, such as DNA synthesis, cytoskeleton and
extracellular matrix, translation, immune/inflammation and growth
factor/proliferation pathways, better than the expected response
similarity between species.

1 INTRODUCTION

From basic biology to translational medicine and clinical trials,
animal models have been an invaluable tool for inferring human
biological responses. Yet, in spite of the advances these models
have facilitated, numerous ﬁndings have also been unsuccessfully
translated to humans, as evidenced by the failure of many clinical
trials. These failures could derive from species-speciﬁc differences
in response to perturbations or stimuli that would preclude
naively translating information learned in one animal model
directly to another. Systems biology offers the means for under-
standing the limits of translatability of animal models in different
settings, from clinical trials to toxicological assessments to basic
cell biology. This approach can provide a more comprehensive
predictive model because it considers changes at different levels
of the entire system.

This is achieved through the development of systematic
studies and integration of data over multiple experiments and
data-generation platforms (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004;
Consortium, 2004, 2010; Gerstein et al., 2010; Goh et al., 2007;
Meyer et al., 2012; Papin et al., 2005; Tarca et al., 2013).
These more complete models will aid our understanding of at
what regulatory levels and to what degree responses to different
perturbations are translatable between species.

When developing models for species translation, orthologous
genes are commonly thought to share the same or similar
function. This assumption does not always hold, as several
reports show that even among closely related species this is not
necessarily the case (Gharib and Robinson-Rechavi, 2011). Such
divergence goes beyond differences in function and can be seen in
changes in essentiality; among 120 mouse orthologs of human

essential genes, 27 (22.5%) were found to be non-essential
(Liao and Zhang, 2008). In contrast, while paralogs may be
expected to diverge more often than orthologs, it has been
observed that changes in paralog function are observed with
the same frequency as in orthologs (Studer and Robinson-
Rechavi, 2009). Certainly, changes in the essentiality and func-
tional role of a gene product are not solely driven by differences
in gene sequence but also other factors (i.e. spatiotemporal
expression of genes) must be considered when investigating
species translation.

Gene expression, being at the core of biological function,
is commonly used to evaluate changes between species and
their response to perturbations. The conservation of promoters
and transcription factor (TF) binding sites are important
predictors of gene expression similarity, and there is a correlation
between conservation of TF binding events and conservation of
the target gene expression (Hemberg and Kreiman, 2011).
TF promoter binding sites are conserved in liver cells for ~ 30%
of the cases when comparing human and mice (Odom et al.,
2007), and most conserved non-coding DNA regions in verte-
brates correspond to regulatory elements (Hemberg et al., 2012).

Existing species translation methods rely heavily on the
concept of pathways for organization and prediction (Alleyne
et al., 2009). Indeed, it seems that pathways may be better con-
served than its individual components (i.e. genes and proteins;
McGary et al., 2010; Subramanian et al., 2005), as groups of
orthologous genes may continue to operate together between
species. In such cases, pathway analysis provides important
organizational information on the potential action of sets of
genes. The two main approaches for deriving pathways or
sets of functionally coherent genes are topology-driven and
data-driven (Melas et al., 2011).

The sbv IMPROVER Species Translation Challenge (STC),
using a systems biology approach, provided participants with
both training and test datasets designed to assess the ability of
methods to predict responses in normal human bronchial epithe-
lial (NHBE) primary cells coming from two different donors
from the responses observed in normal rat bronchial epithelial
(NRBE) primary cells coming from an inbred laboratory strain.
These cells were exposed to 52 different stimuli. Stimuli
were chosen to ensure a broad spectrum of perturbations in
the cellular system, and for each stimulus, samples were collected
at different time points to generate phosphoproteomics, gene
expression and secreted cytokines data. These data were used
by 29 teams to make 49 predictions across four different
sub-challenges that were each evaluated using multiple scoring

metrics. The STC was centrally focused on two questions: (i) can
the phosphoproteomic responses in human cells be predicted
given responses generated by the same stimuli in rat cells?
If so, does the accuracy of this prediction depend on the
nature of the applied perturbation? (ii) Which gene expression
regulatory processes (biological pathways/functions) are predict-
able across species?

2 METHODS
2.1 Data preparation

A complete description of the experimental design, data set generation
and processing can be found in (Poussin et al., 2014). In brief, 19
phosphoproteins, 22 cytokines and genome-wide mRNA levels were mea-
sured under 52 different stimuli or Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DME) control treatments (in triplicate), Table l. The experiment was
performed in two parts: 40 stimuli in the first experiment and 12 in the
second. In each part, primary NHBE and NRBE cells were grown and
exposed to the indicated number of stimuli. Cells were collected and lysed
at different time points: 5 and 25 min. For phosphoprotein measure-
ments, 6 h for gene expression measurements and 24h for cytokine meas-
urements. All cells were exposed to stimuli in triplicate, and DME
controls were performed in 4-, S— or 6-plicate.

mRNA samples from the first experiment were processed in three
batches. Each batch included human and rat mRNA for a subset of
stimuli. DME control mRNA samples (four replicates) were measured
for each batch. For the second experiment, all mRNA samples were pro-
cessed together, including DME control mRNA samples (five replicates).
Low-quality chips were excluded following quality control (QC) analysis.
All remaining expression data including two to three replicates per stimu-
lus were normalized using GC robust multiarray averaging within species.
Probesets were mapped to gene symbols using Affymetrix annotations:
HG-U133 Plus 2 (na33) and Rodent 230 2.0 (na32), for human and rat,
respectively. Probesets mapping to multiple genes were excluded. In cases
of multiple probesets mapping to the same gene, the probeset with the
highest average expression over all experimental conditions was selected
as representative. These high-quality normalized gene expression data in
the gene symbol namespace were provided to the participants.

Protein phosphorylation status was measured independently for each
experiment part in cell lysates collected at S and 25 min (in triplicates)
using Luminex xMap (Dunbar, 2006). Experiment parts 1 and 2 have 6
and S DME controls, respectively. After QC, l6 phosphoproteins were
kept for the challenge. Data were normalized using a robust regression,
and normalized values were provided as the ratio of residuals to the root
mean squared error of the fit. Cytokine data were similarly processed,
though normalization was carried out by taking the Z—score of each
cytokine across all stimuli within an experimental batch, including
DME controls.

Understanding the limits of animal models as predictors of human biology

 

All data were divided into two equal groups, subsets A and B,
by stimulus treatment to be used for training and testing of
methods. To ensure similar distributions of signals in both data subsets,
stimuli were separated through a data-driven approach that clustered
stimuli according to phosphorylation level, gene set activation, gene
expression (GEx) batch and differential gene expression. For each cluster,
stimuli were randomly assigned to subset A or B.

Orthologs were identified using the HGNC Comparison of Orthology
Predictions (downloaded December 19, 2012). Only gene symbol map-
pings between human and rat were used. A total of 12 458 orthologs were
common between human and rat Affymetrix arrays after mapping of
probesets to gene symbols.

Gene sets were based on the C2CP (Canonical Pathways) collection
from MSigDB v3.1 of the Broad Institute (Subramanian et al., 2005).
This collection was filtered to remove highly redundant gene sets,
i.e. overlapping gene sets with many shared members, ensuring that
remaining gene sets cover as many pathways/biological functions as
possible. The resulting 246 gene sets were used for the STC. Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to assess co-regulation of
genes representative of pathways/biological functions. For the analysis,
genes were ranked based on calculated LIMMA t-values comparing re-
spective DME control versus stimulus conditions (Smyth, 2004).
LIMMA was performed using the lmFit and eBayes functions from the
limma R package for the R Statistical Language with default parameters.
The design matrix was constructed to compare the batch-speciﬁc DME
control with each stimulus individually. Computed NES and associated
significance values for each gene set were indicative of the activation/
perturbation (increase or decrease) of pathways/biological functions by
each stimulus in NHBE and NRBE cells (Subramanian et al., 2005).
GSEA size parameters were min = 15 and max = 500. GSEA NES and
FDR q-values were provided to participants.

2.2 Scoring

Sub-challenges l (SCl), 2 (SC2) and 3 (SC3) were scored as binary clas-
sification problems. Starting with the postulate that no single metric will
capture all the attributes of a prediction, we used an aggregate of three
metrics for evaluation. The metrics were proposed by IBM team mem-
bers, and an independent panel of experts comprising the External
Scoring Panel (ESP) decided on the final scoring approach. Participant
identities were kept anonymous to the IBM team scoring the submissions.
Five other metrics were considered but rejected as being redundant to the
chosen three. The details of these metrics were not disclosed to the par-
ticipants until the end of the challenge to avoid inﬂuencing method
development toward optimizing for the scoring function rather than
solving the scientific question posed. This practice is in keeping
of other prediction evaluation challenges, like CASP, DREAM and a
previous iteration of sbv IMPROVER.

We used non-redundant metrics that highlight three different qualities
of a prediction: threshold versus non-threshold, order-based versus con-
ﬁdence-based and different ways of rewarding correct versus incorrect
predictions. The chosen metrics were also selected to avoid rewarding
pathological predictions, e.g. predicting all items to be of one class.
Further complicating metric selection, the quantities of both classes
(active and inactive) were imbalanced in the STC with active cases
accounting for only~ 10% of all cases.

Participants were required to give conﬁdence values for their predictions
of either protein phosphorylation status or gene set activation (increase or
decrease) to a given stimulus, depending on the sub-challenge. Conﬁdence
values could range between 0 and l, where 1 represents the full conﬁdence
of an element being activated (either up- or downregulated) and 0 for full
conﬁdence of inactivation. A binarized gold standard (GS) was developed
for protein phosphorylation status and gene set activation. For the
phosphoprotein GS, normalized expression levels, which is akin to the
standard deviation of a normal distribution, with an absolute value :3

were considered active, as agreed on by the ESP. Similarly for gene set
activation, GSEA FDR q-values 50.25 were designated active, as recom-
mended by GSEA.

The submitted matrix of predictions (stimuli versus protein or gene set
response) could have been scored column-by-column or row-by-row and
then aggregated together. However, given the sparseness of the GS for
both protein phosphorylation status and gene set activation, we decided
(in agreement with the ESP) to transform the matrix into a vector for
scoring, i.e. columns of the matrix were joined to obtain single vector.

2.2.] Metric descriptions Area Under the PrecisioniRecall Curve
(AUPR) is a well-known measure of classiﬁer power. A list of items is
ordered by descending conﬁdence value (used only for ranking and not
directly in the metric). The list is traversed corresponding to increasingly
permissive conﬁdence thresholds, and precision (fraction of ‘active’ pre-
dictions that are correct) is plotted versus recall (fraction of true ‘active’
class members correctly predicted). The area under this precisionirecall
curve is the AUPR score and is represented by a single number that
summarizes the tradeoff between both measures.

Balanced Accuracy (BAC) avoids magnifying performance estimates of
imbalanced datasets. It is computed as the average accuracy of either

class.
1 TP T
BA =— —-l-— 1
C 2(P [\llv) ()

where TP is the number of true positives, P is total number of posi-
tives, TN is the number of true negatives and N is the total number of
negatives. For the STC, we used a conﬁdence threshold of 0.5 to binarize
the predictions as either positive (30.5) or negative (<0.5).

Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) describes the linear dependence
between two variables. In the STC, it was computed as the correlation
between the predictions and the binarized GS, where 1 indicates an item is
active and 0 inactive. PCC normally ranges from 71 to l, but to be
consistent with the AUPR and BAC measures, which range from 0 to
l, we used a normalized PCC:

l
P CCnormalizcd = E (PCC+  

For simplicity, we will refer to PCCnOI-maﬁzed as PCC when in reference
to the challenge scoring metric.

2.2.2 Metrics aggregation A rank-sum scheme to aggregate scoring
metrics was proposed by the IBM team, along with one alternative, and
was selected by the ESP because it equally weights each metric to produce
an overall ranking. This rank-sum scheme was composed of ranking all
teams within each respective metric. A team’s aggregate rank was then
calculated by summing their rank across these three metrics. This rank
sum was used for the ﬁnal ordering of participants, with best performers
achieving the lowest rank sum. To determine the robustness of these
rankings, bootstrapping was performed to ensure that best performers
were not highly sensitive to the exact conﬁguration of GS. GS was
sampled without replacement 1000 times, and the rankings recomputed
each time. Given the imbalanced nature of GS, the bootstrapping was
constrained to maintain the same proportion of active versus inactive
items as observed in the entire GS.

2.3 Statistical signiﬁcance of metrics

The null distribution for each metric in SCl-3 was generated by scoring
106 random predictions. To generate the conﬁdences of a random sub-
mission, a uniform random number r (0 5 r 5 1) was generated for each
‘item’.

For SCl-3, the null hypothesis simulation was used to compute
Z-scores. The mean (a) and standard deviation (0) of the scores obtained
by the simulated prediction was computed and combined with an
individual team’s score (x) to calculate the Z-score.

 

Zscore = x _ M (3)
o

FDRs were computed for each metric using the R (Computing, 2013)
function p.adjust with the method = ‘fdr’, which computes the Benjamini
and Hochberg (1995) correction.

To compute a score’s P-value for each of the metrics, we counted the
number of random predictions that were better than or equal to
the observed score and divided it by the number of simulated predictions.
FDR correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) was applied to the
P-value, and a value of 50.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

The measure S represents the overall response similarity between
human H and rat R GS, and is a Matthews correlation coefﬁcient
(MCC). The MCC represents a Pearson correlation between two
binary vectors. A high S value would indicate a putatively conserved
response and a signal that is expected to be translatable. Similarity meas-
ures can also be calculated per stimulus S, = MCC(R,, H,), where R, and
H, are binary vectors of phosphoprotein or gene set responses to stimulus
s; per phosphoprotein Sp = MCC(Rp, Hp), where Rp and Hp are binary
vectors of responses to stimuli for phosphoprotein p; and per gene set
Sg = MCC(Rg, Hg), where Rg and Hg are binary vectors of responses to
stimuli for gene set g.

Predictability Pr represents the overall similarity or agreement between
the GS and a team’s or aggregate of teams’ predictions T, and is a MCC.
A high Pr value would indicate good prediction performance and that the
response was predictable. Like S, Pr can be calculated per stimulus
PrS = MCC(GS,, T,), where GS, and T, are binary vectors of predicted
phosphoprotein or gene set responses to stimulus s; per phosphoprotein
Prp = MCC(GSp, Tp), where GSp and Tp are binary vectors of predicted
responses to stimuli for phosphoprotein p; and per gene set
Prg = MCC(GSg, Tg), where GSg and Tg are binary vectors of predicted
responses to stimuli for gene set g.

The empirical P-values for the presence of genes in overlapping
gene sets were calculated by sampling 105 times choosing a group of
25 gene sets of 246 gene sets. The frequency a gene is a member of
the 25 randomly selected gene sets is recorded. The P-value is
obtained by dividing the frequency a gene was found in at least x gene
sets by 105.

3 RESULTS

The STC consisted of four sub-challenges, each addressing a
different aspect of translatability: the intra-species protein
phosphorylation prediction (SCl), the inter-species protein phos-
phorylation prediction (SC2), the inter-species pathway perturb-
ation prediction (SC3) and the species-speciﬁc network inference
(SC4). We explored the translatability of signals between differ-
ent layers of transduction pathways by asking whether gene
expression measurements are sufﬁcient to predict upstream
changes in protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, we examined
across-species similarity in pathway activation by testing whether
it was possible to predict the gene set activation and phosphor-
ylation status of different pathways and important signaling
proteins, respectively, in human lung epithelial cells given expres-
sion data in rat. These questions could reveal to what extent
mathematical models are capable of recapitulating perturbed
cellular functions from different data types within the same cell
type and its across-species cell counterpart.

While the primary aim of SC2-4 was species translation,
SCl focused on assessing the informative power of transcriptional
changes in response to different stimuli to infer phosphorylation
responses. Transcriptional changes are typically the result of
upstream signaling events driven by phosphorylation cascades.
SCl sought to address whether changes in gene expression are
sufﬁciently informative to infer the molecular modifications
observed upstream, in particular, the phosphorylation status
of effector proteins. Furthermore, insights derived from this
challenge could be informative for teams in the remaining
sub-challenges. When making across-species predictions, it may
be important to understand to what extent transcriptional data
should be weighted when inferring phosphoproteomic responses.

Hence for SCl, participants were provided with GEx, protein
phosphorylation (P) and secreted cytokine (Cy) data from stimuli
subset A as training data (Fig. 1A). For testing, participants were
asked to predict which proteins showed changes in their phos-
phorylation status (up- or downregulation is hereafter considered
as an activation also stated as a response) for each stimulus in
subset B. These predictions were to be reported as conﬁdence
values between 0 and l, where 1 indicated the highest conﬁdence
of activation and 0 the lowest conﬁdence. Phosphorylation levels
were measured by the Luminex xMAP technologyia
bead-based assay where microspheres are coated with antibodies
designed to bind speciﬁcally to phosphorylated proteinsiin
primary NRBE cells under growing conditions (see methods).

As SCl dealt with inferring protein phosphorylation status
from downstream gene expression response, SC2 extended that
aim to assess the across-species translatability of that phosphor-
ylation status over the same set of proteins and stimuli. This
sub-challenge required the prediction of human phosphoprotein
activation in subset B based on equivalent data from homolo-
gous phosphoproteins in rat. The participants were provided
with P, GEx and Cy data from subsets A and B in rat and
subset A in human (Fig. 1A). Predictions could be based on
translating signals directly from rat phosphoproteins to human
phosphoproteins. They could also be made using GEx data to
generate across-species inferences of gene expression that would
then be used to predict human phosphoprotein status leveraging
computational approaches developed for SCl. Similar to SC2,
SC3 sought to explore the across-species translatability of
molecular changes in the signaling response pathway, here
focused on transcriptomic responses. Though orthologous
genes by sequence conservation do not necessarily share the
same pattern of expression changes, functionally coherent sets
of genes representing biological pathways may often have a more
conserved response between species or continue to operate as a
group. It may also be the case that similar pathways are activated
between species, but each uses different sets of genes from the
same gene families. As such, SC3 asked for a prediction of the
activation status of a broad range of gene sets in subset B of
human cells (Fig. 1A), provided similar data as in SC2, along
with gene set enrichment scores with associated significance
values for subsets A and B in rat and subset A in human.
From this sub-challenge, we hoped to identify which biological
processes/pathways are similarly or differently perturbed
between species, enabling the identification of conserved or
divergent responses between biological systems.

training dataset to generate species-speciﬁc networks through the addition and removal of edges. Though cytokine measurements were made available to
participants, they were not used in scoring, and for simplicity, were not included in this overview ﬁgure

The goal of SC4 was to infer human and rat networks given P,
GEx and Cy data, as well as an a priori reference network
(Fig. 1B). Participants were asked to use network inference meth-
odologies to add or remove edges from the reference network to
produce rat-speciﬁc and human-speciﬁc networks (see Bilal et al.
in this issue). This sub-challenge differed from the others in that
there is no obvious GS, but instead looked to leverage the
wisdom of crowds to develop a consensus network that describes
the conservation and divergence of biological pathways and
interactions in response to the stimuli in subset A.

3.1 Challenge results

SCI-3 was scored in three different ways using different criteria
and measured by the PCC, AUPR and BAC between the
submitted conﬁdence values and binarized GS. The ranks of
the participants for each of these metrics were combined to
obtain a ﬁnal ranking (see methods). The robustness of
these ranks was evaluated by subsampling 10% of the GS

1000><, while preserving the proportion of active/inactive calls,
and calculating P-values (Supplementary Fig. S2).

As shown in Supplementary Figures SlA and S2A and
Supplementary Table S1, from among 21 participating teams
in SCI, the top three teamsiteams 49, 50 and 75—could not
be distinguished robustly between one another, and all were
declared best performers (see Dayarian et al. in this issue). We
compared these results to a series of aggregated ‘teams’ formed
by averaging the prediction conﬁdences of the best N teams to
ascertain whether information could be gained by leveraging the
wisdom of crowds. We found that the score for the aggregate of
all teams ranks fourth overall and is better than the best pet-
formers in two out of three metrics (AUPR and PCC,
Supplementary Fig. S3A). From among 13 participating teams
in SC2, team 50 was clearly the best performer, followed by
Team 111 [see (Biehl et al., 2014) in this issue]. In this
sub-challenge, averaging the predictions of all teams did not
fare better than the best performer, but ranked ﬁfth overall
and was better than the second best performer in two of three

metrics (AUPR and PCC, Supplementary Fig. S3B). Finally
in SC3, of 7 participating teams, team 50 was again the best
performer, followed by Teams 49 and 111, which tied for second
(see Hormoz et al. and Hafemeister et al. in this issue). As in
SC2, averaging the prediction conﬁdences of all teams did not
fare better than the best performer, but the aggregate of all teams
ranked fourth overall and was better than the second
best performer in two of three metrics (AUPR and PCC,
Supplementary Fig. S3C).

A known risk in classiﬁcation problems is that some
algorithms correctly separate the classes but label them
incorrectly. Having seen such mislabeling in previous challenges,
we attempted to identify similar occurrences in this challenge.
Though reversing class labels may be less likely when datasets
are highly imbalanced, as the STC was with only an~ 10% GS
activation level in SCl-3, several teams from across different sub-
challenges would have improved their rank if their class labels
were reversed. It is important to note that if a prediction is close
to random, then evaluating the reversed labels can give a small
increase of performance. However, our aim was to look for
predictions with large differences in their scores and where the
prediction with reversed labels scores much higher. In SCl four
teams received a slightly better score when their prediction labels
were reversed, and two teams achieved slightly better scores in
SC2. SC3 stood out with one team, Team 111, having clearly
reversed its labels, and its revised score would have positioned
them as the best performer (see Hafemeister et al. in this issue).

The overall success of participants in a sub-challenge can be
measured by the median Z—score of the scoring metrics, which
may be used to quantify the amount of predictive signal available
in the provided data for a given classiﬁcation problem. Z—scores
offer a useful cross-challenge measure, as it takes into account
size differences in the universe of predictions; important, since
participants had to predict the activity of 16 x 26 phosphopro-
teinistimulus pairs (SCl-2) and 246 x 26 gene setistimulus pairs
(SC3). Comparisons of the Z—scores for the three different met-
rics in Figures 2A7C suggest that protein phosphorylation was
easier to translate across species (SC2) than solely within species
from GEx (SCl), as reﬂected by higher Z—scores for AUPR and
PCC. Inter-species protein phosphorylation also appeared easier
to translate than inter-species pathway activation (SC3), as sup-
ported by the lower AUPR and PCC Z—scores for SC3 compared
with SC2. The Z—scores for all three sub-challenges were tied for
BAC (Fig. 2A7C).

The diversity of algorithms that participants deployed when
solving the STC and broad rank distribution of similar
approaches indicates these results were independent of the
method used. Indeed, 7 teams used support vector machines
(SVM), 14 teams used regression-based methods, 8 teams used
decision trees or random forest, 4 teams used neural networks
and 3 teams used a Bayesian approach. When the teams’ rank
distribution was separated by the type of approach used for each
sub-challenge, no clear tendency arose as the rankings of similar
methods varied widely (Fig. 21}F). Teams tried different
combinations of feature selection approaches and classiﬁcation
algorithms. Although the sub-challenges shared similarities and a
single team was best performer, no single combination of meth-
ods was universally advantageous across all sub-challenges.
Consider that for SC2, 8 of 13 participants did not use GEx to

infer phosphorylation activation in human and restricted their
analysis to rat protein phosphorylation data. This seemed to be
advantageous, as 5 of the 6 top-ranked submissions did not use
gene expression, but no statistically signiﬁcant difference
was found between those who did and did not use GEx
(P—value = 0.35, Fig. 2G). Nevertheless, there were some promis-
ing approaches arising from the STC. Neural network
approaches ranked 1 and 2 for SC2, and it would have ranked
1 in SC3 had the class labels been reversed. The analysis of
methods also suggested that a promising combination for the
task of feature selection and classiﬁcation is to select a subset
of genes and use Linear Discriminant Analysis, an approach
taken by half of the top 3 performing methods used for SCl
and SC2.

3.2 Analysis of stimulus prediction through gene sets and
phosphoproteins

To assess how the accuracy of the participants’ predictions
depended on the nature of the stimulus applied, we deﬁned the
species similarity S and the predictability or teams’ prediction
performance Pr. Brieﬂy, S is the MCC between rat and human
GS, and Pr is the MCC between a team’s submission and the
human GS. A high S value would indicate a putatively conserved
response between rat and human; a high Pr suggests the signal is
well translated by participants. S and Pr could be defined for
stimuli based on gene set or protein phosphorylation activation.
S and Pr could also be deﬁned for gene set and phosphorylation
activation based on response to stimuli (see methods for details).
Figure 3 shows the mean Pr, for all participants plotted against
S, based on the activation of gene sets (Fig. 3A) and protein
phosphorylation (Fig. 3B).

Based on both gene set and phosphoprotein activation, clo-
mipramine and ILlB were better predicted than expected by S,
(Pr,>S,>0). In addition, formaldehyde, taurocholic acid, cisa—
pride and activation, and insulin were better predicted based
on protein phosphorylation. The correlation between Pr, and
S, was higher for protein phosphorylation activation
(PCC = 0.6, P—value<0.013) than for gene set activation
(PCC = 0.326, P—value<0.051), perhaps reﬂecting not only a
higher predictability for the protein phosphorylation data but
also its smaller prediction space. Overall a higher percentage of
teams performed better than SS when predicting gene set acti-
vation in response to stimuli versus predicting phosphorylation
status. Figure 3 shows that in 12 stimuli at least 50% of teams
achieved a Pr,>S, when predicting gene set activation
(Fig. 3C), but only in one stimulus, HBEGF, when predicting
phosphorylation status (Fig. 3D). The individual team values
Pr, for protein phosphorylation and gene set activation are
displayed in Supplementary Figure S4, and it shows that the
translation of epigallocatechin and dimethyloxalyglycine was
particularly difﬁcult for both data types. Finally although
aggregating the results of all teams did not yield a better over-
all prediction of stimuli effects when predicting protein phos-
phorylation, the aggregate of the five best teams performed
better than individual predictions for insulin, clomipramine,
ILlB, dimethyloxalyglycine, NaCl and epigallocatechin
(Supplementary Fig. S4B).

3.3 Analysis of pathway predictions through gene sets
and phosphoproteins

We also set out to assess the accuracy of the participants’ pre-
dictions regarding different biological pathways and to test
which gene expression regulatory processes (biological path-
ways/functions) were translatable and therefore predictable
across species. To do so, we deﬁned the species similarity for
protein and similar measures of predictability, or teams’ predic-
tion performance, Pr], and Prg (see methods).

Figure 4A and B show the mean Pr], and Prg for all partici-
pants plotted against S], and Sg, respectively, based on activation
in stimuli. A total of 49 of 246 gene sets were predicted better
than expected by Sg (Prg> Sg>0, Fig. 4A). Prediction perform-
ance per phosphoprotein Pr], showed a ribosomal protein S6
kinase (KS6A1) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MK09

and MP2K6) were predicted better than expected by S I, (Fig. 4B).
Although aggregating all teams’ results did not yield a better
overall prediction for protein phosphorylation activity, the
aggregate of the five best teams performed better than individual
predictions (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The high correlation
between Pr, and S, (PCC= 0.71, P—value<0.0087) reveals
that most of the pathways deﬁned by the protein phosphoryl-
ation activation were predicted with an accuracy expected by
species similarity. We observed a similar situation for gene set
activation prediction, with a lower but still signiﬁcant correlation
(PCC = 0.38, P-value<le-6). These results again suggested a
slightly higher predictability in the protein phosphorylation
data, though the prediction space was smaller. The individual
team values for Pr], and found that participants’ predictions
were well translated for 71 of 176 active gene sets and for 8 of

Fig. 3. Predictability versus species similarity for stimuli. (A) The y-axis indicates for each stimulus the mean predictability Pr, of all team predictions
when considering gene set activation in SC3. The x-axis is species similarity S, of gene set activation. In red are stimuli where Pr,> S,> 0. (B) The y-axis
indicates for each stimulus the mean predictability Pr, of all team predictions when considering protein phosphorylation activation in SC2. The x-axis is
Sp of phosphoprotein activation. In red are stimuli where Pr,> S,> 0. (C, D) Plots showing the percentage of teams where Pr,> S, for each stimulus
when predicting gene set activation (C) or phosphoprotein activation (D). Stimuli are ordered by percentage of teams and the number of activated gene
sets or phosphorylated proteins is indicated on top of each stimulus. The number of active calls per gene set is shown on the top of the graph. Nineteen
stimuli are not shown in (B) and (D) because no proteins were measured as phosphorylated

l6 phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 4A and B). Overall a higher
percentage of teams performed better than species similarity
when predicting protein phosphorylation activation (55%)
versus predicting gene set activation (41%; see Fig. 4C and D).
Nevertheless, when looking specifically at the set of active gene
set and stimulus pairs (n = 560), 30% were correctly predicted
by at least three teams (Fig. 5A), and in contrast to phosphor-
ylation activation, six of seven teams in SC3 were better at glo-
bally translating the effects of stimuli than gene set activity
(Fig. 5B).

The 25 best-predicted gene sets showed some concordance in
the biological processes they represent; in particular, translation
and protein folding, apoptosis, metabolism, immune response
(TCR, cytokine), growth signaling pathways (insulin, NGF,
MET, TGFB), kinase signaling (ERK, PI3K), cell cytoskeleton
and adhesion [extracellular matrix (ECM), integrin, actin,
LlCAM] were well predicted (Fig. 5C). It was possible that spe-
ciﬁc genes were especially important for reaching high levels of
predictability. To identify such biological drivers, the gene mem-
bership of the top 25 best-predicted gene sets (Z—score 3 1.9) was

reviewed to identify genes that were consistently present.
Moreover, from GSEA, genes identiﬁed as part of the CORE
enrichment may be considered as the most biologically relevant as
they contributed signiﬁcantly to the enrichment score and were
part of the ‘leading edge’ subset (Subramanian et al., 2005).
Figure 5D reﬂects a hierarchical clustering of genes that were
present in at least 4 of the top 25 best-predicted gene sets (49
genes among 19 gene sets), as well as the frequency they were
found as part of the CORE enrichment for that gene set. The TF
CREBl, the elongation factor eIF4EBPl and kinases like AKTl,
PIK3, PDPKl and MAPK3 were in many of these gene sets and
were also part of the CORE enrichment set for those gene sets,
though their presence was not statistically signiﬁcant. Notably,
CREBl and AKTl phosphorylation activity was also well pre-
dicted by participants in SC2 (Fig. 4B). Yet, MAPK3 activity
was not, showing some but not total coherence between the
drivers of predictability in the two different data types, gene
set and protein phosphorylation activation. Finally we per-
formed a similar analysis looking for the most biologically rele-
vant genes when considering the gene sets that were better

replication factors were signiﬁcantly enriched, as was a paxilin
gene related to the FAKl kinase, whose phosphorylation status
was not very well translated by the participants (Fig. 4B).

4 DISCUSSION

We organized the STC as part of the sbv IMPROVER initiative
and provided participants with experimental data describing
multiple layers of different signaling pathways. The goal was to
assess the ability of computational methods to predict biological
responses in primary NHBE cells based on responses observed in
primary NRBE cells. Several of our observations support the
conclusion that changes in phosphorylation status and gene set
activation induced by cellular response to 52 different perturb-
ations in human cells can be predicted to some extent given
responses generated in rat cells. Overall, stimuli caused more
activation in rat than in human cells for most gene sets and for
all phosphoproteins, except for phosphoproteins KS6A1 and
HSPBl (Supplementary Fig. S7). The differences in stimulus-

induced activity could be due to a more homogenous biological
sample in rats than in humans, or simply to higher sensitivity and
faster signaling of NRBE cells compared with NHBE cells.
Interestingly, differences between the kinetics of activation of
homolog phosphoproteins at the 5 and 25 min time points were
minimal [14 pairs for the whole dataset; see Figure 3 in (Biehl
et al., 2014) in this issue].

Although not statistically significant, the average performance
over all participants tended to be higher in SC2 than in SC3. This
was seen in the higher Pr values when predicting stimuli activity
across all phosphoproteins or gene sets and also when predicting
the challenges’ respective signaling layer, gene set activation or
phosphorylation responses across all stimuli. This observation
holds when considering the performance of the best performer
in both sub-challenges, where Team AMG’s prediction Pr values
were higher for SC2 versus SC3.

When we considered cases where the majority of participants
performed better than species similarity, i.e. a naive, direct trans-
lation, l2 stimuli and 71 (of 176) active gene sets were well
predicted in SC3, and 8 phosphoproteins and l stimulus in
SC2 (Figs 3C and D and 4C and D). The greater number of

clustering of gene sets and genes that are present in at least 4 of the top 25 best predicted gene sets. Each cell is valued according to gene set membership
and frequency the gene is found as part of that gene set’s GSEA CORE enrichment set. Gene/ gene set pairs are assigned a 0 if the gene is not a member,
1 if only a member or 1 -i- C, where C is the number of stimuli under which the gene is found to be part of the CORE enrichment. Cells have a theoretical
maximum value of 27. Cells are represented by a blue scale ranging from dark blue for 0 to white for the maximum value reached, here 7. Signiﬁcantly
overrepresented genes among these gene sets are labeled red (P-value<0.01) or yellow (P-value<0.05)

well-predicted stimuli by gene set activation may have to do with
the relatively lower levels of similarity Sg as compared with Sp,
although, importantly teams were able to find informative bio-
logical signal in spite of these lower levels of response conserva-
tion. Finally, 10 teams in SC2 and 5 teams in SC3
submitted predictions that were statistically signiﬁcantly different
from random in two of the three metrics used (Supplementary
Tables $1783). Overall for SCI-3, about two-thirds of the
submissions were statistically signiﬁcant (26 of 41), this indi-
cates that in SCI, GEx data were sufﬁciently informative to
infer upstream phosphorylation responses and that overall
across-species predictions were achievable for speciﬁc stimuli,
phosphoproteins and gene sets.

While many teams achieved a statistically signiﬁcant result
when considering random submissions as a null hypothesis,
most teams in SC2 found their methods were unable to outper-
form a completely naive approach to the challenge. If a team had
submitted the rat’s subset B protein phosphorylation status in
SC2 and the gene set activations in SC3 as their predictions, they

would have ranked second and ﬁfth, respectively. However,
best-performer teams used approaches that did signiﬁcantly
better than the naive approach, suggesting that their computa-
tional methods could capture additional informative biological
signal in rat data [see in this issue (Biehl et al., 2014), Hafemeister
et a], and Hormoz et al.]. Interestingly, there was also not a
statistically signiﬁcant difference between the ﬁve teams that
used both P and GEx data and all others. The SC2 second
place team, Team IGB, went further to test multiple variations
of their Neural Network method to include GEx data and found
it fared worse than methods using phosphorylation data alone
[see (Biehl et al., 2014) in this issue]. This may be owed to the
smaller difference in relative standard deviations (RSD) between
human and rat phosphorylation response data versus GEx data
(Supplementary Fig. 88). The similarity in phosphorylation
response across species may have been difﬁcult to detect due to
the low number of replicate samplesionly 3. These observations
suggesting that it was relatively easier to predict a response of the
phosphoproteomic layer are also reﬂected in the median Z—scores

of the challenge metrics, where SC2 Z—scores were higher than
SC3 for AUPR and PCC (Fig. 2A7C). These results likely reﬂect
both the larger universe of predictions for SC3, which were an
order of magnitude greater than for SC2 (246 x 26 = 6396 gene
sets/stimuli pairs versus 16 x 26 = 416 phosphoproteins/stimuli
pairs) and also a higher conservation between rat and human for
protein phosphorylation activation (S, = 0.71) compared with
the gene set activation (Sg = 0.38). It is also possible that the
higher similarity in phosphorylation response and smaller differ-
ence in the RSD between human and rat in the protein phos-
phorylation data with respect to the GEx data enabled more
accurate predictions (Supplementary Fig. S8). This is likely due
to the greater heterogeneity of human samples coming from two
different donors compared with rat samples coming from an
inbred laboratory strain but also given the increased complexity
of human signaling. Transcriptional responses are a relatively
downstream event from phosphorylation in signaling cascades.
Hence, it is possible that when the signal finally propagates to the
transcriptional layer, many other species-speciﬁc factors may
amplify the differences of response between both species.
An alternative explanation could be related to platform-speciﬁc
biases due to inherent differences in mRNAs. However, we paid
special attention to experimental design and execution as well as
sample and data processing to minimize, as much as possible,
experimental biases and avoid confounding effects within and
between species (Poussin et al., 2014).

Additionally, phosphorylation response predictions beneﬁted
from more targeted experiments, which looked at 16 phospho-
proteins enriched for active signals (Poussin et al., 2014) while
GEx data was genome-wide and would only be expected to have
a small percentage of genes differentially expressed. An interest-
ing follow-up experiment would be to look at targeted gene
expression for the pathway components using more speciﬁc
measurements, like qRT—PCR or deep-sequencing. More
sampled time points for GEx could provide greater granularity
and may reveal patterns difﬁcult to observe with a single 6h
exposure time point, and also conﬁrm whether this choice left
transcriptional responses to particular stimuli undetected.

The STC’s results indicate that GEx data were potentially
noisier and the numbers of active gene setistimulus pairs were
low, however participants in SC3 made better predictions
per stimulus than per gene sets (Fig. 5B). This shows that
given sufﬁciently large datasets, it was still possible to extract a
biologically relevant signal. Stimuli such as the chemical formal-
dehyde, cholesterol-derived taurocholic acid and the serotonin
5-HT4 receptor agonist cisapride were predicted better than the
conservation of the response between both species. Similarly, the
hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalyglycine, the cytokine CCL3,
the TLR activator PolyIC (Fortier et al., 2004) and the nerve
growth factor NT3 were effectively translated and predictable at
a level comparable with the observed conservation of response
S (Fig. 3A) when based only on activation of protein phosphor-
ylation. When we considered the overall prediction performance
for phosphorylation response and gene set activation by all
teams in SC2 and SC3, the antidepressant clomipramine and
cytokine ILlB were better predicted than the levels of response
conservation. This observation indicates that teams were able to
identify human-speciﬁc signals that were not signiﬁcantly present
in the rat data. We also found that predictions based on the two

data-generating platforms were not always in agreement, as in
the case of insulin, which was well predicted based on protein
phosphorylation but not based on gene set activation, and vice
versa for NaCl (Fig. 3A and B).

Regarding the inference of biological processes, the gene sets
predicted better than species similarity and/or best-predicted
were related to DNA synthesis, cytoskeleton and ECM, transla-
tion, immune/inﬂammation and growth factor/proliferation
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6). The gene sets associated
with growth factor/proliferation processes shared a subset of
CORE driver genes belonging to the following signaling
pathways PI3K, RAS, RAF, MAPK, ERK and CREB.
When considering only gene sets that were among the top 25
best predicted and had at least 1 member shared with at least 3
other best predicted gene sets, both CREBl and AKTl genes
were present in, respectively, 4 and 6 of 19 gene sets (Fig. 5D).
To note, the empirical P—values calculated for their presence
across gene sets was not significant, indicating that these genes
are frequently present in gene sets (see Fig. 5D). This may be due
to a central role of these genes in many biological functions
leading to a broad representation of those genes through C2CP
gene sets. At the protein level, the activity of CREBl, AKTl and
MAP kinases such as MAPK9 and MP2K6 was well translated
based on protein phosphorylation activation, showing a consist-
ency in similar pathway perturbation prediction at different
layers of the cellular system. It is interesting to note that the
species similarity of MAPK9 and MP2K6 activation proﬁle
across stimuli was low, whereas the activation of both proteins
was well predicted. The best predicted protein activity was that of
KS6B (p70S6K). This protein is activated upstream by PI3K/
AKT/mTOR protein kinases and regulates downstream phos-
phorylation of p70S6 protein, which is directly involved in the
translation process found to be among the top best-predicted
functions at the gene expression level. Interestingly, EIF4EBP1
and EIF4G1 factors involved in rate-limiting steps during the
initiation phase of protein synthesis (Franke, 2008) were identi-
ﬁed as CORE driver genes of translation-related gene sets, and
the P—value associated to their presence across best-predicted
gene sets was signiﬁcant, indicating that those genes were
rarely shared with other genes sets and therefore were speciﬁc
to this biological function. Importantly, EIF4G1 gene also
belonged to CORE genes contributing to the enrichment of
translation-related gene sets in rat cells, suggesting a conserved
role for this gene between human and rat species. Other proteins,
such as TF65 and IKBA, associated to the NFkB signaling path-
way showed good predictability in their activity in human cells.
This result was coherent with the observation of good predict-
ability for immune/inflammatory—related gene sets.

Except for some proteins such as MAPK9 and MP2K6 as
mentioned above, many proteins of our measured panel have a
level of species similarity that positively correlated with the level
of predictability. This suggests that conserved responses at the
protein levels possibly drive the translatability between both
species in this cellular context.

Agreement in the biological processes that are similar between
rat and human extends to the results of SC4, for the insulin,
ILlR, MAPK, CREBl and NFKB pathways (see Figs 2 and 5
in Bilal et al. in this issue). Participants of SC4 also found that

regulation of RPS6KAI, active in human, and WNKI, in rat,
differed between the two species (see Bilal et al. in this issue).

Finally, we observed that gene sets related to metabolism,
which were generally expected to be conserved between
speciesisuch as insulin secretion, the CREB pathway, amino
acid and fatty acid metabolismiwere indeed well translated,
although oxidative phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis
were less well translated than expected by conservation
(see Supplementary Table S6). The 49 different submissions to
the STC used a diverse set of approaches including SVM, regres-
sion-based methods, tree-based methods like random forest,
neural networks, Bayesian analyses and a genetic algorithm.
The diversity of approaches might explain why the aggregate
of all participant results performed better for two of three metrics
in SC1 and SC2 (Supplementary Fig. S3). A lower participation
level in SC3 may also explain why aggregation of all seven teams’
predictions did not perform better than the best performers.
Interestingly, similar computational methods could have a wide
range of performance within the same challenge, and no single
method emerged as the clear winner (Fig. 2). Yet, methods that
selected a subset of genes and used Linear Discriminant Analysis
ranked among the top 3 performing approaches for SC1 and
SC2. For SC2, one would have naively expected that using
more data would benefit a prediction, and while not statistically
signiﬁcant, participants that used only protein phosphorylation
data tended to rank higher than participants using protein phos-
phorylation data in conjunction with gene expression data
(Fig. 2G).

A notable challenge in the STC was the imbalance in data, as
only~ 10% of stimuli/phosphoprotein and stimuli/ gene set pairs
were active. Such a strong bias toward the inactive class compli-
cates the training of models, although usage of ensemble
methods that repeatedly sample the data, either over- or
under-sampling, to converge on stable predictions could help
overcome this imbalance. Generally, teams did not explicitly
compensate for these imbalances, though methods like random
forest inherently addressed such concerns. Yet as seen in the
challenge results, random forests were not uniformly superior
to all other methods and so there is potential for improved
approaches that more explicitly account for class imbalance.

For their predictions, participants exclusively used data-driven
approaches, and no computational method included a priori
biological knowledge, as would be the case for topological
approaches (Anvar et al., 2011; Melas et al., 2011). This rendered
the interpretation of results with respect to biology more
difﬁcult. The construction and usage of a priori knowledge is
characteristic of topology-based approaches. For example,
Melas et al. used such approaches with data similar to the
STCs to reconstruct pathways from input stimuli to the output
cytokine release with phosphoprotein levels as intermediate sig-
nals. The initial construction of canonical pathways was based
on gathering information from different databases (e. g. KEGG,
Biocarta, etc.) combined with manual curation from the litera-
ture (e. g. reviews). Later, the Boolean networks were refined with
a data-driven method using multi-linear regression on the
phosphoprotein and cytokine data.

Alternative methods, beyond traditional machine learning
approaches that assume training and test sets from the same
dataset/domain, would be necessary to generalize predictions

and enhance biological conclusions. Transfer learning and
domain adaptation would be worth examining specially in prob-
lems that aim to integrate multiple layers of informationisuch
as distances between stimuli based on the similarity of their
chemical structure or their distance similarity in a protein inter-
action/transcriptional response network (Blitzer, 2006; Iorio
et al., 2010; Napolitano et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2011).

The current work constitutes a proof of principle that predict-
ability of responses in an in vitro system from one species is
feasible to some extent given responses from another species.
The results of this challenge provide insights on the predictabil-
ity/accuracy in the context of diverse data types generated at
various layers of the biological system studied; on the importance
of time resolution to gain in prediction accuracy for species-spe-
ciﬁc sequential molecular events; on the different performance of
similar computational methods due to variations in data prepro-
cessing, feature selection and the classiﬁcation algorithm (Tarca
et al.); and on the different degrees of predictability of pathways/
processes depending on the stimulus-induced perturbation in
human and rat bronchial epithelial cells. Processes such as
DNA synthesis, cytoskeleton and ECM, translation, immune/in-
ﬂammation and growth factor/proliferation were better
translated.

It will be important to test whether results and methods dis-
cussed here can be extended to more complex systems such as
tissue, organ and whole organisms, the ultimate objective of
translation between species. A better understanding of the
range of applicability of the translation concept will impact the
predictability of signaling responses, mode of action and efficacy
of drugs in the field of systems pharmacology as well as increase
the conﬁdence in the estimation of human risk from rodent data
for toxicological risk assessment.

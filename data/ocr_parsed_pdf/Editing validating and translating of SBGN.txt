ABSTRACT

Motivation: The recently proposed Systems Biology Graphical
Notation (SBGN) provides a standard for the visual representation of
biochemical and cellular processes. It aims to support more efficient
and accurate communication of biological knowledge between
different research communities in the life sciences. However, to
increase the use of SBGN, tools for editing, validating and translating
SBGN maps are desirable.

Results: We present SBGN-ED, a tool which allows the creation
of all three types of SBGN maps from scratch or the editing of
existing maps, the validation of these maps for syntactical and
semantical correctness, the translation of networks from the KEGG
and MetaCrop databases into SBGN and the export of SBGN maps
into several file and image formats.

Availability: SBGN-ED is freely available from http://vanted.ipk-
gatersleben.de/addons/sbgn-ed. The web site contains also tutorials
and example files.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN; http://sbgn.org)
(Le Novere et (11., 2009) is an emerging standard for the visual
representation of biological networks. This standardization aims
to improve information exchange and to support the collaborative
creation of large maps based on individual modules. Such
uniﬁed graphical representation should overcome the current
situation in which many different styles of networks are used
in biochemical, biological and medical books, articles and online
resources. Especially in the growing ﬁeld of systems biology, where
increasingly complex and large networks have to be investigated,
SBGN offers a promising approach for creating more intuitive and
unambiguous visualizations.

Three different views of biological processes cover different
levels of detail:

(1) Process Description (PD), which shows the temporal
dependencies of biological interactions in a network in detail;

(2) Entity Relationship (ER), which displays the relationships
in which a given entity participates in a network (without
consideration of temporal aspects); and

(3) Activity Flow (AF), which shows the ﬂow of information
between biological entities in a network in an abstract way.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Drawing large interaction maps is a time-consuming task. To
enhance the usability of SBGN, tool support for creating, editing
and validating such maps is required. Currently, several tools
support or have started to consider SBGN, for an overview
see http://sbgn.org/SBGN_Software.

Here we present SBGN-ED, a Vanted (Junker et (11., 2006)
add-on for editing, validating and translating of SBGN maps.
SBGN-ED contains a unique combination of features from
SBGN map creation and editing to syntactic and semantic
validation of SBGN maps, to automatic translation of existing
non-SBGN networks from KEGG (Kanehisa et al.,2010) and
MetaCrop (Grafahrend-Belau et al., 2008) into SBGN, and to
the export of SBGN maps in different ﬁle and image formats.
Furthermore, all methods of the Vanted system for integration and
network-based analysis of high-throughput data, data visualization
and network layout as well as constraint-based model simulation
are fully accessible to the SBGN maps. The Vanted system
and the SBGN-ED add-on form a comprehensive platform for
SBGN-supported analysis and visualization of biological networks.

2 METHODS

SBGN-ED is an add-on for Vanted (Junker et al., 2006). Vanted is an open
source software that offers the loading and editing of networks, allows the
integration of different *omics data and provides a variety of functions for

data mapping and processing, statistical analysis and Visualization. The main
functions of SBGN-ED are:

(l) SBGN map creation and editing;
(2) SBGN map validation; and
(3) the translation of networks into SBGN.

These SBGN maps can then be exported into different ﬁle and image
formats such as GML, GraphML, PDF, SVG, PNG, PNG/HTML image maps
and J PG. The following subsections describe the methodology of important
functions such as validation and translation.

2.1 Editing

SBGN maps can be created from scratch or loaded from ﬁles. The relevant
functionality for editing such maps is similar to well-established editing
methods for networks (see typical network analysis and graph drawing
tools) and allows the addition, removal and alteration of SBGN symbols
(nodes and edges), the alteration of the size, color, label and other attributes
of map elements, and the alteration of the layout of the map manually or
automatically.

Following the SBGN speciﬁcation, SBGN-ED supports all SBGN
symbols (nodes and edges) as well as special connectors deﬁned within
glyphs (e.g. ports sticking out of process nodes). These connectors are
dynamically adapted during the drawing of a map according to user
interaction. For each SBGN language (PD, ER and AF), a side panel contains

the relevant symbols. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of SBGN-ED with two
PD maps and the respective panel for editing these type of SBGN maps.

2.2 Validating

The grammar sections of the SBGN languages describe how the SBGN
glyphs can be combined and connected to produce valid SBGN maps,
which symbols can be duplicated, and so on (see the SBGN speciﬁcation
at http://sbgn.org/Documents/Speciﬁcations). These rules are given in the
form of incidence matrices with nodes as columns and connections or arcs as
rows (each element represents the role of a connection), and some additional
textual descriptions. SBGN-ED checks for correct connections depending on
the relevant incidence matrix and emphasizes graphically invalid elements
(nodes and edges) of a SBGN map for revision. This validation can be applied
at any step, e.g. after loading a map or after editing elements.

2.3 Translating

A large number of networks already existing in databases use different
symbols to represent biological processes. To help in reusing these networks
and avoiding manual redrawing SBGN-ED provides the possibility to
translate metabolic pathways from two different sources into SBGN: the
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2010) and MetaCrop (Grafahrend-Belau et al. , 2008)
databases. The translation of diagrams from both databases follows several
rules derived from the speciﬁcation to create valid SBGN maps. The left
panel in Figure 1 shows a part of the glycolysis pathway from KEGG which
was translated into SBGN notation using SBGN-ED.

2.3.1 KEGG to SBGN Metabolic pathways are translated using the
KEGG Markup Language (KGML) description of diagrams from the KEGG

database. Note that KGML does not always give a complete description
of the elements of the KEGG reference image. Elements which cannot be
automatically translated into SBGN notation are kept in KEGG notation, and
validating the map at the end of the translation is recommended. The number
of nodes in the map is typically increased during the translation from KEGG
to SBGN due to the SBGN speciﬁcation. Therefore, node overlapping may
occur despite an increased node spacing, which can be removed by node
overlapping removal algorithms provided in the tool.

2.3.2 MetaCrop to SBGN Metabolic pathways are translated using GML
ﬁles from the MetaCrop database.

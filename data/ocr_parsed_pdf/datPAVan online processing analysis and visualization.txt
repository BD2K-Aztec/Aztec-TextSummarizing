ABSTRACT

Summary: Data processing, analysis and visualization (datPAV) is
an exploratory tool that allows experimentalist to quickly assess
the general characteristics of the data. This platform-independent
software is designed as a generic tool to process and visualize data
matrices. This tool explores organization of the data, detect errors
and support basic statistical analyses. Processed data can be reused
whereby different step-by-step data processing/analysis workflows
can be created to carry out detailed investigation. The visualization
option provides publication-ready graphics. Applications of this tool
are demonstrated at the web site for three cases of metabolomics,
environmental and hydrodynamic data analysis.

Availability: datPAV is available free for academic use at
http://www.sdwa.nus.edu.sg/datPAV/.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is vital to all the domains of scientiﬁc investigations to design
systematic experiments and extract relevant knowledge from the
data collected. Preliminary investigation of the data is required to
remove the errors such as instrument noise or misplaced samples
or incorrect data entry, all of which lead to serious misinformation
during the analysis step. Exploratory data analysis uses visualization
tools to get overview of data and to transform variables/data for
ﬁirther analysis (Borcard et (11., 2011). For example, systematic
sampling or measurement errors can be detected by observing the
correlation between the variables or by viewing the nature of the
proﬁle for the standard used, during the experiment. A number of
application-speciﬁc tools are available for handling and processing
of experimental datasets (de la Nava et (11 ., 2003; Lavine et (11., 1993;
Stadler et (11., 2006; Stanimirova et (11., 2004) and for graphical
visualization (Militky and Meloun, 1993; Ong and Lee, 1996).
However, data preconditioning poses different challenges than what
these tools are designed to address. Spreadsheet software such as MS
Excel (Palocsay et (11., 2009) or MINITAB (Harvill, 1993) requires
users to individually select the data in the columns and separately

perform desired calculations by entering the formulae. They involve
repetitions of tasks every time a new column or a data sheet has
to be analyzed. Higher level analysis software such as MATLAB,
SPSS and SAS require special training or programming skills and are
expensive commercial packages. For a quick and easy examination
of data, we need a simple data exploration software, which can
provide options for basic processing and quick data visualization.
In this article, we present the description of a platform-independent
data exploratory software called datPAV (data processing, analysis
and visualization).

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Computational model and user interface

This tool features an interactive graphical user interface and harnesses the
power of algorithms designed using efﬁcient web programming techniques.
Programs in datPAV are developed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server
Release 5.5 (Tikanga) using GNU Plot, R, CGI and advanced Perl
programming (all of them are open source or freewares). This version of
the datPAV software is completely compatible with the operating systemsi
Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Linux and Macintosh. datPAV
has been tested to be compatible with the web browsersiFirefox, Internet
Explorer 6, 7 & 8, Google Chrome and Safari. The tool is best Viewed in
‘Firefox’ or ‘IE 8’.

2.2 Data processing, analysis and output

datPAV has a user-friendly three-step procedure (Step 13) for data
exploration involving data input, processing and Visualization which can be
performed easily. The software has four theme tabs for general data analysis,
omics data, hydrodynamics data and environmental data (Fig. 1). The input
data can be any ﬁle that stores tabular data, including ﬂat ﬁles (either CSV
or tab-delimited text ﬁles) which can be uploaded to datPAV server using
standard ﬁle selection interaction.

The suite of basic statistical programs in datPAV include normalization
(global and column), scaling (pareto and mean centering), distribution of
data, averaging, noise removal, moving average ﬁlter, correlation (variable,
auto- and cross-correlation), linear regression, fold change and t-test. These
programs help to determine the distribution of data, establish correlations,
perform fold-change analysis and ﬁt a relation between variables using
linear regression techniques. The function of ‘averaging’ or ‘grouping’ is
required for experiments that involve replicated measurements. The ‘Variable
correlation” tool can be used to explore the experimental consistency or
instrument reliability by Visualizing correlations between the replicates in the
data. This could further help in establishing systematic errors or identifying

themes. Processes and Visualizations can be selected using drop-down menu.

outliers. ‘Fold-change” analysis can be used for controlled experiments to
compare the variation between different trials. ‘Filtering (moving average)”
is exclusively designed for time series data common to environmental or
hydrodynamic studies. In addition, simple data transformation programs for
sorting, transposing and creating new columns with desired formulae are
included.

datPAV has been designed to provide a range of Visualization tools such
as scatter plot, scatter plot matrix, box plot, proﬁles, multi-scale plot, bar
chart (simple, multiple and stacked), heat map, Venn diagram and pie-chart.
datPAV can plot the results of any process in Step 2 (Processing) using
any of the available Visualization schemes in Step 3. In order to facilitate
Visualization suitable for different processes, datPAV provides user-friendly
suggestions. Users can develop workﬂow involving ‘heat map” plots that
show correlations between variables as a way to detect the outlier columns
or systematic errors in data structure along with dependencies between the
variables. Plots of ‘stacked bar chart” and ‘pie chart” can be used to Visualize
the distribution of data in the selected column.

Other features of this tool include a personalized login and workspace
for users to retrieve previous analyses. Workﬂow history allows users to
track and retrieve data which can be reused. Graphics editing capabilities
are provided for captions, labels and graphical resolution.

3 CONCLUSIONS

datPAV is designed as an efﬁcient, free online software
for generalized exploratory data analysis. Data analysis and
visualization process is highly simpliﬁed in three steps. The software
provides tools and useﬁil tips for important data processing/analyses
techniques combined with several visualization programs. The
fast and easy-to-use features of datPAV are especially suited for
experimentalists for quick preconditioning of their datasets.

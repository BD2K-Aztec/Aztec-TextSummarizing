combinations are Isaac and BWA + GATK. For Isaac, indel realignment
is performed by the Isaac aligner, whereas for BWA + GATK, indel re-
alignment is performed post-alignment using GATK. For the GATK
variant calling, the GATK best practices is used, which involves variant
calling using the Uniﬁed Genotyper followed by ﬁltering with the
variant quality score recalibration (VQSR) protocol (McKenna et al.,
2010).

2.3 Datasets

Two datasets were used for the analysis. The ﬁrst dataset, used for
the comparison of Isaac and BWA+GATK, is a human family trio
selected from the 1000 Genomes project (Genomes Project, 2010). The
trio consists of CEPH family members NA12878 (child), NA12891
(father) and NA12892 (mother). This dataset was used to evaluate the
variant call quality by assessing the number of Mendelian SNP conﬂicts,
the SNP conﬂict rate and the sensitivity (% callable bases) of each
pipeline.

The second dataset is a neonatal sample (UDT173) used for genetic
disease diagnosis (Saunders et al., 2012). This dataset was used to dem-
onstrate that Isaac can be effectively used to isolate clinically relevant
variants.

In addition to evaluating the quality of the variant calls, the perform-
ance in wall clock time of each pipeline on equivalent computer hardware
architectures is reported.

The CEPH DNA was obtained from Coriell Institute and sequenced
internally on a HiSeq 2000. The neonatal sample was sequenced on a
HiSeq 2500. Polymerase chain reaction-free sequencing methods were
used for all the samples analyzed (Saunders et al., 2012).

2.4 Hardware speciﬁcations

Alignment and variant calling was performed on commodity hardware
comprising a single computer node having 65 GB of random access
memory (RAM) and containing two 8 core Intel® Xeon® CPU
E5-2650  2.00 GHz processors. Hyper threading was activated resulting
in 32 virtual cores. To run the Isaac aligner, a minimum of 48 GB of
RAM is required, whereas BWA requires a minimum of 3 GB of RAM.

3 RESULTS

Table 1 depicts the wall clock time for each of the pipelines. Isaac
took ~778h as compared with 43746h for BWA+GATK,
demonstrating a signiﬁcant performance enhancement on
equivalent computer hardware. One source of this improved
performance is that Isaac does not require generation of
FASTQ files before alignment. In general, the generation of
FASTQ ﬁles adds an additional 273h to the BWA+GATK
workﬂow.

Table 2 compares the quality of the resulting variant calls and
the sensitivity of the two pipelines. The number of conﬂicts was
slightly larger for Isaac with a slight reduction in sensitivity.

Additional alignment and variant metrics are shown in the
Supplementary Section S4.

To demonstrate Isaac’s clinical use, we analyzed a genome
with a previously conﬁrmed novel disease—causing mutation in
ATP7A, causing Menkes Disease (Saunders et al., 2012). To
show that the results of Isaac are capable of being equivalently
ﬁltered to identify the correct disease—causing mutation, we gen—
erated small variants from the same genome sequence data using
Isaac. The variants went through an annotation pipeline [Variant
Effect Predictor (VEP), 1000 genomes, Human Gene Mutation
Database (HGMD)] (Genomes Project, 2010; McLaren et al.,

ABSTRACT

Summary: pViz.js is a visualization library for displaying protein
sequence features in a Web browser. By simply providing a sequence
and the locations of its features, this lightweight, yet versatile,
JavaScript library renders an interactive view of the protein features.
Interactive exploration of protein sequence features over the Web is a
common need in Bioinformatics. Although many Web sites have
developed viewers to display these features, their implementations
are usually focused on data from a specific source or use case.
Some of these viewers can be adapted to fit other use cases but
are not designed to be reusable. pViz makes it easy to display features
as boxes aligned to a protein sequence with zooming functionality but
also includes predefined renderings for secondary structure and post-
translational modifications. The library is designed to further customize
this view. We demonstrate such applications of pViz using two
examples: a proteomic data visualization tool with an embedded
viewer for displaying features on protein structure, and a tool to visu-
alize the results of the variant_effect_predictor tool from Ensembl.
Availability and implementation: pViz.js is a JavaScript library, avail-
able on github at https://github.com/Genentech/pviz. This site
includes examples and functional applications, installation instructions
and usage documentation. A Readme file, which explains how to use
pViz with examples, is available as Supplementary Material A.

1 INTRODUCTION

Visualization of protein features such as protein domains, post-
translational modiﬁcations or sequence polymorphisms is critical
for interpretation and analysis of proteomic data. Interactive
Visualization of multiple sources of protein features allows for
integrated data analysis and hypothesis generation.

A number of tools have previously been developed that enable
Visualization of protein features. Some Web sites include custom
Views that are tightly integrated with the Web site [ex. nextProt
(Lane et al., 2012), Interpro (Hunter et al., 2011), Pfam (Punta
et al., 2012), Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000),
etc. among many others]. Distributed Annotation System

(DAS Dowell et al., 2001) client tools like the
DASProteinFeatureViewer component of BioJ S (Gomez et al.,
2013) and JalView (Waterhouse et al., 2009) offer limited ﬂexi-
bility to customize the View or data sources, as data needs to be
served by a DAS server or uploaded by the user. Most others
tools, like Protter (Omasits et al., 2013), are Java tools that have
dependency on a particular version of Java, require servers for
hosting the application and are not designed to be customized or
incorporated into a third-party Web site. Tools for customizing
the data sources, user interactions or styling of protein features
are limited for developers of Web-based Visualizations.

pViz.js (pViz) makes it easy to display protein sequence fea-
tures on a Web page. Knowledge of HTML and basic JavaScript
is all that is required to use the library. Basic usage involves
including the library within a script tag in HTML, and writing
a few lines of code. Given a sequence and a list of positioned
features, the library displays the sequence and the features
aligned to it. Features are laid out, so as not to overlap each
other, allowing zoom, interaction and customization. Developing
pViz as a core library allows it to be used as a component of
other third-party libraries or Web pages allowing for application
speciﬁc customization.

2 METHODS

pViz requires writing JavaScript code to create a protein features View.
JavaScript is a popular language for developing interactive Web applica-
tions and is widely used in bioinformatics. This programmatic approach
allows for ﬂexibility in customizing the data sources, display and inter-
actions. pViz is built on other commodity libraries, including backbone.js
(http://backbonejs.org), d3.js (http://d3js.org), bootstrap (http://getboot
strap.com) and jQuery (http://jquery.com), which are bundled in the
pViz distribution.

A View in pViz is built by creating a Squntry object, containing a
sequence and a list of features (see ﬁg. 1A for a working example).
Sequence features have start and end positions and can have several op-
tional attributes: (i) type, which is used for setting display and interaction
behavior (e.g. ‘Phosphorylation’, ‘Helix’, ‘PTM’ or ‘SNP’), (ii) category,
which groups features and displays them on a separate track, (e.g. ‘sec-
ondary structure’ or ‘domain’ and (iii) group, which allows features in the
same category separated by their group, (e.g. ‘experiment’, ‘predicted’).
Additional attributes can be attached to a feature, such as text to be
displayed or a quantiﬁcation measure, which can be used to customize
the display. Sequences and features typically come from many different
sources. pViz supports FASTA, DAS and Proteomics Standards
Initiative (PS1), PS1 Extended Fasta Format.

pViz also supports display of multiple proteins. This can be useful
when a simple summary of all features in a set of proteins is desired
before presenting features on a single protein. It is this ability of the

library to let developers adapt it to their needs that makes pViz a power-
ful tool. Both the display (size, shape or color) and interaction (the action
performed on a mouse event) for each feature type can be customized
based on the needs. Display can be deﬁned via the cascading style sheets
rules or explicit construction of graphical widgets in Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG). Although customizing SVG is more complex, it is sup-
ported by the d3.js library, which allows constructing virtually any type of
graphical widget.

Interactivity is a key feature of pViz. The default implementation
allows zooming on the sequence and one can deﬁne behaviors triggered
by a mouse click or hover position on the sequence or features. Stand-
alone examples of these functionalities are included in the distribution. To
demonstrate these capabilities, we describe two sample applications
included in the pViz distribution.

2.1 Viewer for Ensembl’s Variant Effect Predictor

We developed a viewer for Ensembl’s Variant Effect Predictor (VEP;
McLaren et al., 2010) using pViz, available at http://research-pub.gene.
com/pviz/app/vep. The viewer displays the protein coding variants as
features on the proteins listed along with any variant annotation in the
VEP output. The consequences calculated by the VEP script are used to
categorize the variants annotations available in VEP, including protein

domains, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) and Polyphen scores
are used to color the variants. The gene name available in the output is
used for searching the proteins.

2.2 Viewer for Proteomics data on Protein Structures

We also developed a viewer for displaying proteomic data on primary
sequence and tertiary structures by extending the GLmol library (webgl-
mol.sourceforge.jp). The mapping of a protein sequence to a PDB struc-
ture is parsed from a Uniprot (Magrane and UniProt Consortium, 2011)
entry and is displayed as a feature. The customization capabilities of pViz
were extended to display the PDB structure when the features were
clicked and also to display overlapping features on the protein structures.
The mouse-over event was also customized to show the cursor position
on the sequence and the structure simultaneously (Fig. 1B). This tool is
available at http://research-pub.gene.com/pViz/app/proteomics-Sd

3 CONCLUSION

There has been a lack of tools for developing interactive protein
feature Visualizations that are easy to embed in a Web page. pViz
is an open-source library that addresses this problem and makes
it easy to integrate within larger applications. By using
JavaScript, it renders Visualization on the client side, thereby
avoiding the need for a separate server or a dependency on
Java. The library provides basic interactivity like zoom and
mouse-over information out of the box with additional hooks
for interactions for the developer to implement. Multiple work-
ing examples of these, ranging from simple features to highly
customized Visualizations are available on GitHub.

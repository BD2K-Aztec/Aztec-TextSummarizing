ABSTRACT

Motivation: A codon position could perform different or multiple roles
in alternative transcripts of a gene. For instance, a non-synonymous
position in one transcript could be a synonymous site in another.
Alternatively, a position could remain as non-synonymous in multiple
transcripts. Here we examined the impact of codon position plurality
on the frequency of deleterious single-nucleotide variations (SNVs)
using data from 6500 human exomes.

Results: Our results showed that the proportion of deleterious SNVs
was more than 2-fold higher in positions that remain non-synonymous
in multiple transcripts compared with that observed in positions that
are non-synonymous in one or some transcript(s) and synonymous or
intronic in other(s). Furthermore, we observed a positive relationship
between the fraction of deleterious non-synonymous SNVs and the
number of proteins (alternative splice variants) affected. These results
demonstrate that the plurality of codon positions is an important attri-
bute, which could be useful in identifying mutations associated with
diseases.

1 INTRODUCTION

A major task in clinical genomics is to identify mutations asso-
ciated with human diseases (Cooper and Shendure, 2011; Ward
and Kellis, 2012). A number of computational prediction meth-
ods have been developed in the recent past to detect these dele-
terious mutations and to distinguish them from benign
population polymorphisms (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Bromberg
and Rost, 2007; Cooper et al., 2005; Kircher et al., 2014;
Kumar et al., 2012; Ng and Henikoff, 2003; Schwarz et al.,
2010; Siepel et al., 2005). Most of these methods examined the
long-term evolutionary consequences of a mutation using the
multiple-sequence alignments of human and other species.
These methods predicted that mutations occurring in evolution-
arily conserved positions are likely to be deleterious and hence
have the potential to be associated with human diseases. Some of
these methods evaluated the functional consequences of a muta-
tion as well (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Bromberg and Rost, 2007;
Kircher et al., 2014; Schwarz et al., 2010). These methods pro-
posed that mutations occurring in critical positions of a protein
(such as a substrate binding site or a splice site) are likely to be

deleterious as they disrupt the function and/or structure of a
protein or mRNA. Furthermore, these methods suggested that
mutations that result in changes between dissimilar amino acids
are more deleterious than those between similar amino acids.
However unlike conservation-based methods, these methods
are applicable only to protein-coding regions. Nevertheless,
these function-based methods have immense use in clinical gen-
omics because almost 50% of the disease-associated mutations
were found to be located in protein-coding regions (Stenson
et al., 2009; Subramanian and Kumar, 2006). Using conserva-
tion- as well as function-based methods, recent studies revealed
an abundance of deleterious amino acid polymorphisms in
human exomes (Coventry et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2013; Nelson
et al., 2012; Subramanian, 2012; Tennessen et al., 2012).

Although these methods are useful in predicting deleterious
variants, additional methods are still required to improve the
accuracy of finding them. For this purpose, it is important to
examine the possibility of using various genomic features. In this
study, we focused on the roles of a position in human protein-
coding genes. A codon position could perform different and/or
multiple roles in alternate transcripts of a gene. For instance, a
non-synonymous position in one transcript could be a synonym-
ous or intronic position in another (Fig. 1). On the other hand, a
site could remain non-synonymous in multiple transcripts. It is
not clear how this site plurality inﬂuences the frequency of oc-
currence of deleterious single-nucleotide variations (SNVs).
Furthermore, it is interesting to examine the relationship between
the frequency of deleterious non-synonymous SNVs and the
number of proteins (alternative splice variants) affected. The
availability of large exome datasets has enabled us to address
these issues.

2 METHODS
2.1 Exome data

Exome data from 6515 humans were obtained from the Exome Variant
Server (evs.gs.washington.edu), which included exomes from 4298
European Americans and 2217 African Americans (Fu et al., 2013).
We extracted only SNVs and grouped them based on the pattern of
sharing between various transcripts. We examined only the SNVs present
in non-synonymous, synonymous, intron, untranslated region (UTR) and
splice sites, which were denoted as ‘missense’, ‘coding-synonymous’, ‘in-
tron’, ‘3-UTR’ (or ‘S-UTR’) and ‘splice-3’ (or ‘splice-S’), respectively. The
annotations were based on Seattleseq Annotation 137 (http://snp.gs.
washington.edu/SeattleSqunnotation137/He1pInputFi1esjsp), in which
splice sites were deﬁned as two bases at 5’ and 3’ ends of introns.

We ﬁrst grouped the SNVs present exclusively in one of the above
genomic regions. For example, the SNVs present only in non-synonym-
ous positions of multiple transcripts (eg. 2 in Fig. 1). Then we grouped
those present in any two of the above regions in different transcripts. For
instance, an SNV could occur in a non-synonymous position in one tran-
script but a synonymous position in another transcript of the same gene
(eg. 1 in Fig. 1). Alternatively, an SNV might be present in a splice site of
one transcript but in an intron of another transcript (eg. 5 in Fig. 1).

Because of their complexity, we excluded SNVs present in three or
more different genomic regions. We also grouped non-synonymous
SNVs based on the number of alternatively spliced proteins affected by
the mutation. For example, SNV 2 in Figure 1 affects non-synonymous
sites of all three transcripts, whereas SNV 3 affects non-synonymous sites
of two transcripts and intron of one transcript.

2.2 Data analysis

To identify the deleterious nature of an SNV, we used three methods,
namely GERP (Cooper et al., 2005), Phastcons (Siepel et al., 2005) and
Polyphen (Adzhubei et al., 2010). Hence, for the results shown in Figure
2A and B, we included only SNVs for which both GERP and Phastcons
scores were available. However, for the results shown in Figure 2C, we
included only the non-synonymous SNVs for which a Polyphen predic-
tion (such as ‘benign’, ‘possibly deleterious’ or ‘probably deleterious’) was
also available. To determine the deleterious nature of an SNV, we used
the following thresholds: GERP score >5.0, Phastcons score >09 and
Polyphen score >0.95 or designated as ‘probably deleterious’. The pro-
portion of deleterious SNVs was estimated using the ratio of deleterious
SNVs to total SNVs. Standard error estimates were based on the
binomial variance. A Z-test was used to determine the significance of
the difference between the proportions of deleterious SNVs estimated
for a pair of comparisons. R studio was used for multiple regression
analysis.

We used biallelic SNVs for all analyses reported. However, restricting
the analysis using only the derived alleles also produced similar results
(data not shown). To identify the orientation of the SNVs, we used
the ancestral state of the nucleotides, which was inferred from six primate
EPO alignments (Abecasis et al., 2010). All analyses were performed
using SNVs present in multiple transcripts, and those present in single
transcripts were only used for comparison in Figure 2C (column 1).

To estimate the proportion of transcripts affected by an SNV, we
assumed that synonymous sites, introns and UTRs are largely neutral,

and non-synonymous positions and splice sites are under selective con-
straint. If a gene has ﬁve transcripts and an SNV affects a non-synonym-
ous/splice site in two transcripts and a synonymous site/intron/UTR in
the other three transcripts, then the proportion of transcripts affected was
calculated to be 2/5 or 40%. Hence, this measure was calculated as fol-

3 RESULTS

3.1 Duality of codon positions

We first examined the effects of purifying selection on the
codon positions that perform dual roles in different transcripts.
For this purpose, SNVs present in two different locations in
multiple transcripts were grouped based on the type of codon
positions. For example, SNVs could be present in a non-
synonymous position of one transcript but in an intron of
another transcript. We also grouped the SNVs present in only
one type of exomic position (eg. non-synonymous positions in
multiple transcripts). We then computed the proportion of dele-
terious SNVs in each group of SNVs shown in Figure 2A and
Supplementary Table S1.

It is evident that SNVs present exclusively in splice sites are the
most deleterious (48%). This is much higher than the proportion
of deleterious SNVs affecting only non-synonymous sites (28%),
which suggests a greater purifying selection in splice sites.
Interestingly, the deleterious proportion (38%) of the SNVs
affecting a splice site of one (or more) transcript(s) and a
non-synonymous position of the remaining transcript(s) was
intermediate between the two groups mentioned above. This sug-
gests that the magnitude of purifying selection on the sites is
roughly the average of the selective constraints on the two
types of positions.

The deleterious fraction was only 14% for the SNVs present
exclusively in synonymous sites or in introns or UTRs suggesting
a nearly neutral evolution at these sites. In contrast, the deleteri-
ous fraction was 1&21% for the SNVs present in the sites that
perform as synonymous sites/intron/UTRs in one or more
transcripts and non-synonymous sites in the remaining tran-
script(s). This proportion was intermediate as it was much
higher than that computed using only non-coding sites (14%)
but less than that estimated exclusively using non-synonymous
sites (28%).

3.2 Quantifying the magnitude of selection constraint in
alternatively spliced genes

The above results suggest that an SNV in a genomic position is
under selective constraint for one or few transcripts of a gene (if
they affect a non-synonymous or a splice site) and under nearly
neutral evolution (if they affect a synonymous/intron/UTR site)
for the remaining transcripts. Therefore, the selection pressure on
these sites is less than that on sites that are constrained (eg. non-
synonymous sites) in all transcripts but higher than that on sites
that are nearly neutral or slightly deleterious in nature. Hence,
the sites that perform different roles in various transcripts

experience intermediate or mean selection pressure. However,
the above results are rather qualitative, and the mean selection
pressure depends on the number of transcripts under selective
constraint as well as those under nearly neutral evolution.
Hence, to systematically quantify this, we estimated the propor-
tion of transcripts affected by an SNV as shown in Section 2. We
then plotted this measure against the proportion of deleterious
SNVs and observed a perfect positive correlation between them
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S2). For example, the dele-
terious fraction was only 0.17 for the SNVs that affect the non-
synonymous sites (or splice sites) of 35% of the transcripts and
the synonymous (or intron/UTR) sites of the remaining 65% of
the transcripts of the gene. In contrast, this fraction was 0.28,
which is 60% higher for the SNVs that affect the non-synonym-
ous sites of all the transcripts of the gene. This result suggests
that the proportion of transcripts affected by an SNV is an im-
portant measure to predict the frequency of deleterious
mutations.

3.3 Multiplicity of codon positions

In the previous analyses, we examined the selection pressure on
codon positions that perform different functions in different
transcripts (plurality). Next we studied the pattern of purifying
selection on the codon positions that perform the same function
in multiple transcripts (multiplicity). For this purpose, we
included only the SNVs that affect non-synonymous sites of all
transcripts of a gene and excluded those SNVs that affect non-
synonymous sites in one (or more) transcript(s) and synonymous
sites/introns/UTRs in the remaining transcripts of the same gene.
The rationale for this analysis was to compare the amount of
purifying selection on non-synonymous sites of genes coding for
single versus multiple proteins (splice variants). Our results
showed that the deleterious fraction of non-synonymous SNVs
affecting single transcript proteins was 0.22, which was signiﬁ-
cantly (P<0.001) less than that estimated for those affecting
multiple splice variant proteins (0.28).

To examine this further, we divided the SNVs affecting mul-
tiple splice variant proteins into ﬁve groups based on the number
of (splice variant) proteins affected and computed the proportion
of deleterious SNVs for each group (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Table S3). The results clearly showed a positive relationship be-
tween the fraction of deleterious SNVs and the number of pro-
teins affected by the SNVs. The deleterious fraction of SNVs
affecting more than four alternatively spliced proteins (032/
0.27) was 44e55% higher than that of those affecting only
single transcript proteins (0.22/0.18). For this analysis, we also
determined the fraction of deleterious non-synonymous SNVs
using the function-based method Polyphen in addition to the
two other conservation-based methods. It is clear from
Figure 2C and Supplementary Table S3 that including this
method also produced similar results. These results suggest a
much higher purifying selection on the genes coding for multiple
proteins compared with those coding for single proteins. Hence,
mutations occurring at non-synonymous positions of multiple
transcript proteins are more deleterious that those from single
transcript proteins.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we examined ~0.75 million SNVs present in mul-
tiple transcripts (Supplementary Table S1), which constitutes
roughly 41% of the SNVs observed in 6515 human exomes.
This emphasizes the importance of considering the duality and
multiplicity of codon positions. We showed that the duality of
codon positions signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the abundance of dele-
terious SNVs. We also quantified the magnitude of selection
constraints based on the proportion of constrained transcripts
and the number of alternatively spliced proteins and showed that
the proportion of deleterious SNVs correlates positively with
both of these measures. One of the interesting ﬁndings of this
study is the much higher proportion of deleterious SNVs in splice
sites compared with that in non-synonymous positions. This is
important because mutations in splice sites are known to affect
>300 genes and are associated with >370 diseases (Wang et al.,
2012). Furthermore, >13 000 splicing-associated disease muta-
tions have been reported in the human gene mutation database
(Stenson et al., 2014).

In this study, we used a set of cutoffs to designate a deleterious
SNV following previous studies, and different methods use dif-
ferent sets of criterion to predict a deleterious SNV. However,
these limitations do not affect our conclusions because our re-
sults are only comparative. Nevertheless, to address these issues,
we reanalyzed the data using a recently developed measure called
Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) score
(Kircher et al., 2014). This method integrates diverse prediction
methods (including the three methods used here) and produces a
single score indicating the extent of functional consequences of
an SNV. To avoid using a cutoff value, we compared the mean
estimates of the CADD scores obtained for different site cate-
gories (Supplementary Fig. S1). Our results based on this new
measure also produced similar results (compare Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S1). For instance, the CADD score of the
SNVs affecting non-synonymous -l- synonymous sites (12.2) was
higher than the score estimated for the SNVs affecting exclu-
sively synonymous sites (6.7) and lower than that obtained for
the SNVs affecting non-synonymous sites only (14.9).

In our analyses, we used SNVs from human genes under
strong as well as weak selection pressures. Hence, it is important
to examine whether the magnitude of selection pressure on genes
(as opposed to that on independent sites or SNVs) inﬂuences the
plurality or multiplicity of codon positions. To examine this, we
separated the SNVs into three groups based on the magnitude of
selection constraints on their respective genes. For this purpose,
we used the ratio of non-synonymous—to-synonymous divergence
(dN/dS) estimated for each gene using the humanirhesus
monkey comparison. This analysis produced results
(Supplementary Figs S27S4 and Supplementary Tables S4eS6)
similar to those reported in Figure 2A7C. For instance, the pro-
portion of deleterious SNVs affecting exclusively non-synonym-
ous sites of highly constrained genes (dN/dS<0.1) was much
higher than that estimated for those affecting non-synonymous
sites in one (or more) transcripts and intron or synonymous sites
in the other remaining transcripts (0.38 versus 0.140.287
Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S4). A similar
pattern (0.20 versus 0.084115) was also observed for weakly
constrained genes (dN/dS>0.2) and the estimates were

proportionally lower than the former. We also performed logistic
binomial regression analysis by using 0 or 1 as the probability of
an SNV being non-deleterious or deleterious, respectively. This
was taken as a function of the proportion of transcripts affected
(site-speciﬁc trait), dN/dS (gene-speciﬁc trait) plus the interaction
between them. This analysis revealed that the proportion of af-
fected transcripts is highly significant (P< 10’”) in predicting the
probability of an SNV to be deleterious in nature. We obtained
similar highly significant result when using the number of pro-
teins affected as a predictor. Finally we replaced the binomial
variable (0 or 1) with the actual probability of an SNV to be
deleterious computed by the software Polyphen and performed a
multiple regression analysis. This result showed that the variable,
the number of proteins affected is highly significant (P<10’16)
even after controlling for the effects of dN/dS. These findings
demonstrate that the gene-speciﬁc constraints do not inﬂuence
our results.

To identify deleterious SNVs, a number of methods have been
developed in the past. These methods are either based on the
evolutionary conservation of genomic positions and/or on the
functional consequences of mutations. Here we showed a new
genomic feature, the alternative splicing, which could potentially
be used to identify deleterious SNVs. The results of this study
suggest that the duality or multiplicity of codon positions could
be used as an independent measure to detect deleterious variants.
For instance, if a mutation is located in a codon position that
remains a non-synonymous site in ﬁve or more transcripts (of a
corresponding gene), then it is more likely to be deleterious than
if the mutation is in a position that is non-synonymous in only
one transcript even if both positions have similar GERP (or
other) scores. Hence, along with other scores such as GERP,
Phastcons and Polyphen, the plurality and multiplicity of a
codon position could be used to increase the probability of iden-
tifying disease-associated mutations.

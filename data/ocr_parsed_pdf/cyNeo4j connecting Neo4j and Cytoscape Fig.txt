Abstract

Summary: We developed cyNeo4j, a Cytoscape App to link Cytoscape and Ne04j databases to util—

ize the performance and storage capacities Ne04j

offers. We implemented a Ne04j

NetworkAnalyzer, ForceAtlaSZ layout and Cypher component to demonstrate the possibilities a dis—

tributed setup of Cytoscape and Ne04j have.

Availability and implementation: The app is available from the Cytoscape App Store at http://apps.
cytoscape.0rg/apps/cyne04j, the Ne04j plugins at www.github.com/gsummer/cyne04j—parent and
the community and commercial editions of Ne04j can be found at http://www.ne04j.c0m.

1 Introduction

Network biology facilitates the understanding of complex biological
systems by organizing, analyzing and visualizing knowledge and
experimental data in networks. Built upon the field of graph theory,
network biology provides researchers decades worth of research in
the form of sophisticated graph algorithms. Software applications
like Cytoscape (Saito et (11., 2012; Shannon et (11., 2003) and Gephi
(Bastian et (11., 2009) are developed to provide visualization and ana-
lysis methods to data scientists, with Cytoscape being widely used in
life sciences. As networks are becoming larger and more complex,
the computational performance necessary to analyze them increases
drastically. Moving the computation from desktop environments
like Cytoscape and Gephi to powerful servers is a common method
used to cope with the increasing demand for computation. We pre-
sent cyNeo4j, a Cytoscape app to link Cytoscape on the desktop to
a server environment using a Neo4j database. Neo4j (www.neo4j.
com) is a Java-based database designed to store and query graphs.
Neo4j falls in the category of NoSQL databases as it departs from
the relational model used in traditional databases. Neo4j ensures
transaction reliability through ACID compliance, provides a SQL-
inspired query language called Cypher and its community edition is
free to use and open source. Additionally, Neo4j servers can be
extended using plugins to add more complex algorithms than the

ones built in. CyNeo4j supports two such plugins which showcase
the performance increase that can be achieved using a Neo4j and
powerful computational backend. As of version 1.1, cyNeo4j sup-
ports a plugin that provides a set of network layout algorithms and
a plugin that implements the Cytoscape NetworkAnalyzer. We will
briefly explain how Cytoscape users can enrich their workflows
with cyNeo4j and how app and algorithm developers can benefit
from it.

2 cyNeo4j for Cytoscape users

A prerequisite for cyNeo4j is a running Neo4j server. Neo4j pro-
vides thorough documentation to setup the server, additionally
tutorials are available on the cyNeo4j website. The server can be run
on the same computer or ideally on a computationally more power-
ful one. The first task for a Cytoscape user is to connect to a Neo4j
database. After the connection is established and validated by
cyNeo4j, the app discovers all algorithms available on the server
and supported by the app itself. There are two typical use-cases for
cyNeo4j: the network to be analyzed is available locally in
Cytoscape or a network is stored in the running Neo4j server. In the
first case the user can upload a network from Cytoscape to
the Neo4j server and then run algorithms on it both locally and

Abstract

Summary: For numerous experimental applications, PCR primers must be designed to efficiently
amplify a set of homologous DNA sequences while giving rise to amplicons with maximally di—
verse signatures. We developed DesignSignatures to automate the process of designing primers
for high—resolution melting (HRM), fragment length polymorphism (FLP) and sequencing experi—
ments. The program also finds the best restriction enzyme to further diversify HRM or FLP signa—
tures. This enables efficient comparison across many experimental designs in order to maximize

signature diversity.

Availability and implementation: DesignSignatures is accessible as a web tool at www.DEC|PHER.
cee.wisc.edu, or as part of the DECIPHER open source software package for R available from

1 Introduction

Primer design is a fundamental step to any application of polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR), including high-resolution melting (HRM)
analysis, fragment length polymorphism (FLP) analysis and ampli-
con sequencing. Although these techniques differ considerably, a
common design objective is to construct primers that can efficiently
amplify many different template variants while maximizing the dif-
ference between the resulting amplicon ‘signatures’—melt curve,
length or sequence depending on the experimental method. While
many primer design tools are available (Noguera et (11., 2014), there
currently does not exist a design tool that brings together different
experimental techniques sharing the objective of maximizing signa-
ture diversity. Moreover, no automatic method is available to design
primers for HRM analysis. Instead, semi-manual design approaches
are typically used with the aid of software for melt curve prediction
(Dwight et (11., 2011). Although this approach is reasonable for dis-
criminating single nucleotide polymorphisms, it is unlikely to yield
optimal results when the goal is to differentiate more complex vari-
ants. Furthermore, when variants are impossible to distinguish with
FLP or HRM, digesting amplicons with a restriction enzyme can
greatly diversify their signatures (Akey et (11., 2001). In such cases,

an automated solution is highly desirable for exploring the space of
possible primer and restriction enzyme pairings. By accurately pre-
dicting results in silico, design choices can be efficiently compared to
maximize resolving power and minimize costs.

2 Methods

DesignSignatures designs primers in three or four steps:

1. Designing forward and reverse primers that will efﬁciently amp-
lify as many input sequences (i.e. alleles) as possible.

2. Determining the set of PCR products for each combination of
forward and reverse primers.

3. Scoring each candidate primer pair based on the diversity of its
resulting amplicon signatures in sequencing, FLP or HRM.

4. Optionally, choosing the best restriction enzyme to further
maximize signature diversity in FLP or HRM experiments.

The user provides a set of unaligned input DNA sequences (see
the Supplementary Information (SI) text for usage information). The
sequences (i.e. alleles) may be grouped if multiple templates will be
present in the same PCR reaction, such as in the case of duplicate

phylogenetic analysis task (de Koning et al, 2010). Furthermore,
the approach was designed to substantially reduce the scaling of
time complexity with model complexity (Supplementary Fig. S1),
so that model realism can be more effectively explored without
the need to greatly oversimplify models for computational
convenience.

For example, the times to achieve an average of 1000 effect—
ively independent posterior samples on a large dataset are shown
for a variety of amino acid substitution models (Table 1).
Remarkably, the most parameter—rich site—homogeneous model
in this set is also the easiest to sample from (and therefore the
fastest), because conjugate Gibbs sampling mechanisms are pos—
sible for all parameters in this case (general non—reversible).
Thus, not only do these approaches reduce the need to simplify
models for computational convenience but also in some cases
they facilitate an inversion of incentives, making complex
models more computationally convenient than simpler ones. It
should be noted that similar contrasts can be constructed when
exact substitution timings are augmented (Lartillot, 2006). For
performance comparisons between PLEX and several popular
phylogenetics programs, see Supplementary Results.

When Gibbs update mechanisms are unavailable for a given
model, PLEX uses slice sampling or MetropolisiHastings up—
dates. The simple form of PLEX’s likelihood function often
makes likelihood evaluations for these mechanisms extremely
rapid and sometimes even 0(1) (de Koning et al, 2010).

The PLEX code is written in C/C++ and has no dependencies
on external libraries. It should therefore compile on any platform
that supports standard C/C++.

3 APPLICATIONS

PLEX is run at the command line using a control file interface
that allows customization of analyses, including locations of
input sequence alignments and tree topologies. Example control
ﬁles are included that demonstrate how to run most types of
supported analyses. Any position in the alignment possessing a
gap can be excluded or optionally treated as missing.

PLEX currently has several main uses, including:

(1) Rate matrix and branch—length estimation from hundreds
to thousands of taxa in minutes on a desktop computer.

(2) Inference of site heterogeneity in substitution patterns.

(3) Probabilistic inference of ensembles of ancestral states.

4 Calculation of osterior statistics of substitution histories
p
(e.g. for tests of co—evolution; our unpublished data).

(5) Hypothesis testing and model evaluation using
posterior—predictive statistics (scripts to automate thermo—
dynamic integration will be made available in a future
release).

PLEX is an active research platform for the development of
new models and algorithms. As such, it will be updated fre—
quently and will grow in capabilities over time. We therefore
expect that PLEX will continue to evolve into an increasingly
capable and comprehensive package for studying molecular evo—
lutionary mechanisms.

4 CONCLUSION

PLEX is a software package for performing rapid and accurate
Bayesian MCMC analysis on large phylogenomic datasets that
remain under active development. Future updates will include
models of temporal heterogeneity, spatial substitution gradients
(Faith and Pollock, 2003) and codon substitution. It is likely that
parallelization and tuning of our slice sampling algorithms will
further substantially improve speed for certain complex analysis
tasks and will thus be pursued in future releases.

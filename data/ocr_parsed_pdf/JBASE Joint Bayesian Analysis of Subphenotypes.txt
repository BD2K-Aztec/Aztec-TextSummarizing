Abstract

Motivation: Rapid advances in genotyping and genome—wide association studies have enabled the
discovery of many new genotype—phenotype associations at the resolution of individual markers.
However, these associations explain only a small proportion of theoretically estimated heritability
of most diseases. In this work, we propose an integrative mixture model called JBASE: joint
Bayesian analysis of subphenotypes and epistasis. JBASE explores two major reasons of missing
heritability: interactions between genetic variants, a phenomenon known as epistasis and pheno—
typic heterogeneity, addressed via subphenotyping.

Results: Our extensive simulations in a wide range of scenarios repeatedly demonstrate that
JBASE can identify true underlying subphenotypes, including their associated variants and their
interactions, with high precision. In the presence of phenotypic heterogeneity, JBASE has higher
Power and lower Type 1 Error than five state—of—the—art approaches. We applied our method to a
sample of individuals from Mexico with Type 2 diabetes and discovered two novel epistatic mod—
ules, including two loci each, that define two subphenotypes characterized by differences in body
mass index and waist—to—hip ratio. We successfully replicated these subphenotypes and epistatic
modules in an independent dataset from Mexico genotyped with a different platform.

Availability and implementation: JBASE is implemented in C++, supported on Linux and is avail—
able at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/Ngoldenberg/JBASE/jbase.tar.gz. The genotype data underlying
this study are available upon approval by the ethics review board of the Medical Centre Siglo XXI.

setting would be to set the number of modules to 1. However, this
would mean that there would have to be only one genotypic module
that has to explain the full heterogeneity of the data, an assumption
that is not supported by the current line of evidence on the genetics
of subphenotypes (Bergen, 2014; Northcott et al., 2012; Perry et al.,
2012; Stessman et al., 2014).

Motivated by the fact that epistasis and phenotype heterogeneity
represent two of the main challenges for the missing heritability
problem and the fact that none of the existing methods address both
issues simultaneously, we introduce the JBASE model, which ac—
counts for epistasis and subphenotyping while providing an easily
interpretable probabilistic framework.

2 Methods

Suppose that N individuals are genotyped at M markers and are
measured on F phenotype features. This data D is represented in an
N X (M + F) matrix, where each individual i (ith row) consists of g,
(genotype profile) and z, (phenotype profile) vectors. We further as—
sume that each individual I, : (gi.zi) belongs to a phenotypic subpo—
pulation k E {1 . . . K} whose phenotype variation is associated with
the genotypic variation at the underlying causal/associated markers.
Since subpopulation membership is not known a priori, we introduce
a latent discrete variable C, :i E {1 . . . N}, parameterized by the mix—
ing coefficient vector TE, which defines the assignment of individual i
to one of the K subpopulations, which needs to be supplied as input.

When modeling the genotype, JBASE extends the probabilistic
model implemented in BEAM (Zhang and Liu, 2007), a probabilis—
tic framework that finds causal variants acting on binary phenotypes
independently (marginally) or jointly, i.e. epistatically. Hence, we
model each subphenotype’s genotype submatrix as a collection of
three genotype components: 95 is the null component that contains
markers not associated with the phenotype; GI; is the marginal com—
ponent consisting of markers that independently affect the pheno—
type and GI; is the epistatic component containing markers that
contribute to the phenotype via non—linear interactions.

As these components are not known a priori, they must be
inferred as well. For this reason, we also introduce the latent vari—
able Skmzm E {1  M}.k E {1  K}, which denotes the assign—
ment of a marker m to one of the three marker components of
population k. Hence, 8k denotes the marker—to—genotype component
assignment vector for subphenotype k. As such, the major difference
in our model compared with BEAM (Zhang and Liu, 2007) is the
addition of the multivariate phenotype component and the corres—
ponding breaking down of the parameters into the K phenotypic
groups. We present the likelihood function here. Supplementary
Material Section 52 contains more details, including the derivation
of the posterior distribution, hyper—parameter choices, sampling effi—
ciency and post—processing methodology.

We start with the marginal component. For k and m such that
8km : 1, let 0km : (0km7 0km. 0km3), be the genotype frequencies of
each biallelic marker—a marker that has only 3 states (AA, Aa, aa)
based on the number of minor alleles it has—in the marginal compo—
nent of population k. Then, due to independent effects of markers in
this group, we can write the likelihood of the marginal component
of the subpopulation k as follows:

3 mar
P(G’f10i.6.8k): H {110,227} (1)
m;s,m:1 /:1

where n22; is the number of individuals in subpopulation k that has

ith genotype for marker m.

Markers in the epistatic component are assumed to be generated
by a single multinomial distribution. As each marker can have three
states, this multinomial distribution can have ek : 3Ig§I states, i.e.
interactions, whose frequencies are governed by the parameter
(1),, : (m1, ... up“). Thus, we get:

em

P(9’§I¢k.a8t) = H¢>Z7 (2)
/:1

where n? denotes the number of individuals in subpopulation k
with the genotype combination / over the epistatic markers. Note
that, eh, and hence the dimensionality of (in, vary depending on the
state of 8;, (see Supplementary Material Section 52.2 for details).
The last genotype component to model is the null component.
The parameters of the null component are shared across all compo—
nents, i.e. a marker that is not related to the phenotype should have
the same allelic distribution as other subpopulations in which it is
assigned to the null component. Let 1pm : (1pm,.z/xm2.zpm3) be the
genotype frequencies of a marker m in the general population. Then,

we have:
k 3 "null
P(goIW7QS/¢) : H Hwy (3)
n1:Skm:0 j:1
where n33“ is the number of the occurrence of state f for marker m

across all individuals where it is classified as a null marker.

The final component of the likelihood is the phenotype. In this
work, we have focused on categorical phenotypes only. We model
the phenotype likelihood as a multinomial distribution:

T
he
P(Zuwk.c) = Heap"? (4)
t:1

parameterized with wk : (and, . . . ,wkT), where T is the number of
all possible combinations of values of the different phenotypic vari—
ables, which is fixed based on cardinality of the multinomial distri—
bution, and nire is the number of individuals in subpopulation k
with a phenotype value If. Putting these together, we get the follow—

ing form for likelihood P(D(tﬂ. 0. d). a). C. 8):

K
momma) x {HPrg’i0,2,6.sk>P<g§I¢uasoP<zicom}
k
(5)

where we used go to denote the collection of null components
across all subphenotypes

Using conjugate Dirichlet priors for (p, 0, d) and w, as well as for
the mixing coefficient parameter vectors TE and 01, allows us to inte—
grate out all of the model parameters Q : {1p7 0. d). w. Tr. 01} except la—
tent variables C and 8 (see Supplementary Material Section 52.1 for
details). The final form of the posterior is presented in Equation (6).
As such, the posterior distribution depends only on the hyper—
parameters H : {,0, I}, A, y, r, 6}, which are given as input, and the la—
tent variables C and 8, which are inferred. We perform inference via
sampling from the posterior using the metropolis hastings algorithm
(see Supplementary Material Sections 52.2 and 52.3 for details). It is
also worth mentioning that JBASE can control for linkage disequi—
librium (LD), which can introduce false—positive epistatis, and for
population stratification. For LD, JBASE accepts an optional input
file that lists the markers known to be in LD with associated lists of
linked markers. JBASE, via its proposal distribution on SW, ensures
that linked marker pairs are never assigned to marginal and/0r epi—
static components simultaneously. In addition, one can also specify

R.Colak et al.

 

an optional genomic distance threshold such that markers closer
than the given distance are not allowed to be simultaneously as—
signed to the marginal and/0r epistatic component of a subpopula—
tion. As for population stratification, JBASE leverages the
information obtained from the principal component analysis (PCA)
of individuals by ensuring that the subpopulation means of the most
important PCA dimension(s) do not significantly differ between sub—
populations (see Supplementary Material Section 52.2). This is
achieved by rejecting proposals on variable C, if it causes the means
between subphenotypes to diverge beyond a threshold. Other biolo—
gical constraints can easily be integrated into the proposal distribu—
tion of the metropolis hastings algorithm by eliminating the
undesirable assignments from the state space of the posterior
distribution.

3 Experiments

In this section, we elaborate on our results obtained with JBASE in
extensive simulation studies of established disease models and also
in real GWAS from T2D studies.

3.1 Simulation experiments

There exists a limited number of traits, such as coat color in mice
and comb shape in chickens, where interacting loci and the specific
alleles are well characterized. In this work, we follow the simulation
approach and the disease models described in Zhang and Liu (2007)
with some modifications and improvements. The framework of
Zhang and Liu (2007) was designed for case—control (CC) studies.
We extended their simulations to account for continuous pheno—
types and two case subpopulations. In what follows, we include
brief descriptions of the disease models used by Zhang and Liu
(2007) and give details of the modifications we introduced. We used
five disease models; their risk structures are shown in
Supplementary Figure S4.

° Model 1: Two disease loci with independent effects.

° Model 2: Two loci model, where disease occurs only when at
least one disease—associated allele exists in both loci.

° Model 3: Two loci threshold model such that a single disease
associated allele is sufﬁcient to confer disease risk and additional
ones do not increase the risk.

° Model 4: Three loci model in which increased disease risk is asso—
ciated with certain genotype combinations. Disease alleles at
each locus also contribute a small (possibly zero) additive effect
to the risk.

° Model 5: Three loci model with a mixture of two two—way epi—
static interactions, wherein each two—way interaction increases
the risk. Risk does not increase further when both of the two—
way epistatic interactions are present.

Using a generative mixture model scheme (see Supplementary
Material Section 53.1), we simulated 2000 datasets with K: 2 (i.e.
two case subpopulations and one control subpopulation), N: 1000
individuals and M : 1000 markers. We generated datasets such that
we have at least 20 datasets for each of the 25 possible disease model
pair combinations for the two disease subpopulations. We varied
the size of the larger case subpopulation to be 250, 300, 400 or 500.
Note that when one of the case subpopulations is of size 500, we
have just cases and controls, i.e. without any case subphenotypes,
where the true K: 1 and the specified K: 2. We intentionally
included this extreme scenario to measure performance of JBASE
when the number of subpopulations is misspecified and the disease
does not have subphenotypes.

We compare JBASE with a variety of approaches including both
traditional GWAS, i.e. variants of x2 tests, and more recent methods,
i.e. BEAM (Zhang and Liu, 2007), ordered subset analysis for CC
(OSACC, Qin et al., 2010) and Multinom (Morris et al., 2010), that
are designed to handle epistasis or subphenotyping. A summary of
the algorithms compared across a set of seven desired properties is
presented in Table 1. Below is a brief description of each of the com—
peting methods:

° The x2 CC algorithm corresponds to the traditional CC study, in
which the phenotype is set to 0 for controls and 1 for all cases.
Each marker is tested for association independently from the
others. We use x2 CC as the baseline approach.

° In X2 multiway, each marker is tested for association with a
K—way x2 test where K is the number of distinct categories of the
phenotype obtained by categorization using an equal—bin discret—
ization scheme. This method is a natural extension of x2 CC and
represents a naive baseline approach for subphenotyping.

° Multinom (Morris et al., 2010) improves on the x2 multiway by
addressing disease heterogeneity in a multinomial regression
framework, wherein phenotype is assumed to be sampled from a
mixture of K subphenotypes. These K subphenotypes are derived
from the case population using prior biomedical knowledge. A
multinomial regression model is ﬁtted for each marker, followed
by a log—likelihood ratio test—based P—value calculation to assess
the signiﬁcance of association. A substantial shortcoming of this
approach is that it requires the phenotype group assignment as
input, which are often not readily available. In our simulations,
we use the true subphenotype labels as input to the algorithm,
which is the best possible scenario for this model.

° OSACC algorithm (Qin et al., 2010) is a non—parametric method
that works on continuous phenotypes. It ﬁrst sorts the cases by
phenotype. Starting with the small subpopulation of 50 cases

1 Error, catches up with JBASE and BEAM after the odds ratio in—
creases to z 1.8, which is even less common in real datasets. It
should be noted that other algorithms do not reach 90% power even
in the case of extremely high odds ratios, i.e. z2. This implies that,
contrary to common perception, small population size is not the
only performance bottleneck, since JBASE, and to an extent BEAM,
perform reasonably well in those conditions.

3.1.3 MAF analysis

For a given SNP, MAF refers to the frequency of the less common al—
lele in a given population. Since some algorithms have performance
biases across the MAF spectrum, we demonstrate the performance
of each algorithm across the full MAF spectrum. Note that the MAF
ranges are not simulated directly as the disease simulation models
depend only on risk parameters or and A. However, as these param—
eters vary, MAFs of the underlying embedded variants also vary. As
with the odds ratio analysis, all algorithms behave as expected
across the MAF spectrum (Fig. 2E and F). At the ends of the spec—
trum (i.e. MAF£0.05 and MAF20.35), power of all algorithms de—
grades. Best performance is achieved at moderate MAF ranges:
0.1SMAFSO3 Note that the relatively high variance of algorithms
at small MAF values might be simply due to smaller sample size,
since much fewer (n < 250) markers with MAF < 0.1 were gener—
ated in our simulation experiments. This is because we aimed to
match our experimental MAF spectrum to that of loci discovered in
GWAS (see Supplementary Material Section 53.2.2 for additional
analysis of MAF effects). Typically, GWAS are designed to exclude
SNPs with an MAF < 0.05, as very strong statistical power is
required to detect associations of such rare markers. Although not
shown in the plots, there seems to be a negative correlation
(p : —0.18) between MAF and odds ratio. This explains the de—
crease in power towards higher MAF.

3.1.4 Disease model analysis

Finally, we analyzed the algorithms” behavior for all disease model
combinations (Fig. 2G and H). On average, as we move from left to
right, the complexity increases due to an increase in combinations
that include model 4 and model 5, which are more complex than
model 1, model 2 and model 3. For all algorithms, we see a steady
degradation of power from left to right, correlating with the under—
lying increase in complexity. JBASE maintains best performance
across all combinations by a large margin, followed by BEAM with
the second highest power. All other algorithms suffer from low
power across the majority of disease model combinations. OSACC
and Multinom also exhibit high Type 1 Error rates, while providing
inferior power.

In summary, our extensive simulations show that JBASE and
BEAM have substantially higher power in most of the scenarios we
explored. Even though BEAM also accounts for epistasis, its per—
formance significantly degrades in the presence of phenotype het—
erogeneity—precisely the shortcoming JBASE aims to address.
OSACC and Multinom, on the other hand, perform poorly across
the board, implying that subphenotype modeling without account—
ing for epistasis not only fails to provide power but also results in
higher false—positive rates. We performed additional comparisons
under various thresholds for Type 1 Error (see Supplementary
Material Section 53.2.2), which show results to the same effect.
Our simulations show that in the presence of heterogeneity our
model is able to capture the subpopulations while other methods
are not. JBASE also achieves the performance of BEAM in case
control scenario.

3.2 T2D experiments

T2D is a common and complex metabolic disease affecting millions
of individuals worldwide (Imamura and Maeda, 2011). Long—term
complications of T2D include cardiovascular disease, stroke, dia—
betic retinopathy, kidney problems and neuropathy, among others.
These factors jointly decrease the life expectancy of a T2D patient
by up to 15 years (Davies et al., 2004). T2D is one of the classic ex—
amples of missing heritability: while family heritability has been esti—
mated to be between 26% and 64%, only around 10% has been
accounted for by loci identified in T2D GWAS (Stahl et al., 2012).

We studied a Mexican T2D dataset, which has rich phenotypic
data (Parra et al., 2011). As for phenotypes, we studied BMI and
waist—to—hip ratio (WHR) traits. For a detailed description of the ex—
perimental setup, data pre—processing and the schematic overview of
the full analysis pipeline, see Supplementary Material Section 54.1.

We applied JBASE to each pair of chromosomes independently
to generate an initial set of candidate markers. We ran JBASE with
10 random restarts lasting 200 000 sampling iterations for each
chromosome pair. Although it would be preferable to run all
chromosomes jointly, the computational burden necessitates heuris—
tic screening and prioritization steps. Markers that were classified as
marginal or epistatic in at least 10 of the runs were selected as candi—
date markers. We obtained 64 candidate SNPs (see Supplementary
Table SS). Since the candidate markers were discovered from runs
conducted on pairs of chromosomes independently, we ran JBASE
again after pooling them together. Note that the regions containing
candidate sets of markers were highly enriched for associations with
T2D—related GWAS (see Supplementary Material Section 54.2). In
70 of the 100 pooled runs, JBASE converged to a solution with two
epistatic modules and one weak marginal association distinguishing
two subgroups differentiated based on both BMI and WHR.

The larger subphenotype contains 631 patients with a median
BMI of 30.4 and median WHR of 0.98 (Table 2). The smaller one
contains leaner patients (n : 278) with median BMI of 27.3 and me—
dian WHR of 0.94. Two epistatic sets consisting of two markers
each are associated with these subphenotypes: (i) (rs1159752,
rs48 85712) with a joint marginal P value of 3.45e—22 (according to
the x2 test) and (rs8103847, r512461255) with a joint marginal
P value of 1.71e—25 (x2 test) (Table 3). r51159752 is located at the

5’—end of an uncharacterized gene (LO C101927224). There are sev—
eral reported cholesterol and triglyceride associations in its immedi—
ate vicinity. We used HaploReg (Ward and Kellis, 2012) to check
for regulatory signals in the nearby markers (r2209). Within z3kb
upstream is the SNP rs1929051 (r2 : 1), which modifies a binding
motif of the myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEFZA) gene, a transcrip—
tion factor that regulates many muscle—specific, growth factor—
induced and stress—induced genes. It has been associated with several
T2D—related disorders such as cardiovascular disorders, insulin re—
sistance and hypertension. Its epistatic pair rs4885712 is an inter—
genic SNP and is centrally located in a cluster of associations related
to adiposity, cholesterol, blood pressure and T2D. HaploReg ana—
lysis suggests that it lies within an enhancer. It is located 71 kb up—
stream of the sprouty homolog 2 (SPRYZ) gene recently associated
with obesity (Kilpelainen et al., 201 1). Recent studies have identified
SPRY1 , a homolog of SPRYZ, as a critical regulator of adipose tissue
differentiation (Urs et al., 2010).

The second epistatic module contains two SNPs: rs8103847 and
r512461255. r58103847 is located within an intron region of zinc
finger protein 536 (ZNF536), which is involved in transcriptional
regulation of neuron differentiation. The immediate region 100 kb
upstream of the ZNF536 gene contains a cluster of associations in
BMI, C—reactive protein, cholesterol and hip size. Strikingly, this re—
gion was previously identified as a significant risk factor associated
with T2D in lean European—American individuals (Tudor, 2011).
Moreover, HaploReg suggests that it modifies a binding motif of the
paired box 4 (PAX4) gene as well as the E1A binding protein p300
(EP300) transcription factors. PAX4 is involved in pancreatic islet
development and differentiation of insulin—producing beta cells,
while EP300 is mostly involved in cell differentiation and prolifer—
ation. The EP300 protein physically interacts with the homeobox A
protein (HNF1), which is a key gene associated with several meta—
bolic disorders. The other marker of the epistatic pair, rs12461255,
is an intergenic SNP located within a region with many zinc finger
genes. Its haplotype neighborhood contains several binding regions
for transcription factors and several other modified motifs, suggest—
ing that it sits in a hotspot of regulatory activity.

Finally, JBASE also identified a weak marginal marker
rs1948122 with a posterior probability of z 0.1 and marginal x2 as—
sociation P value of less than 1e — 5 of being associated with the
obese subphenotype in the Mexico—1 experiments. Because of the
low posterior marginal probability JBASE reported, we did not ex—
pect this weak association to replicate.

Before advancing to replication studies, we performed rigorous
genotyping quality, LD and population stratification analysis—based
tests. This was to ensure that these newly discovered subphenotypes
are not artifacts of data quality, LD and/0r population stratification
(see Supplementary Material Section 54.3 for details).

3.2.1 Replication experiments

We analyzed a second dataset from Mexico City (Mexico—2) with
JBASE. Mexico—2 is also an admixed dataset consisting of N: 864
samples genotyped on the Affymetrix Axiom Genome—Wide LAT—1
Array. It includes 817810 SNPs particularly chosen to maximize the
coverage of common genome variation present in Hispanic popula—
tions (Hoffmann et al., 2011). For markers without an exact match
in the two datasets, we selected the closest tag SNPs within their
haplotype mates with r2208. After quality filtering, as applied to
the Mexico—1 dataset, we obtained rsl929045 as a proxy for
r51159752 (r2 : 0.84), rs4805561 for r58103847 (r2 2 1) and
rs4932867 for rsl2461255 (r2 : 1). All of these SNPs have high—
quality genotyping in the Mexico—2 set (Supplementary Fig. 516).

JBASE recovered two subphenotypes (Tables 2 and 3), which are
very similar to the original subphenotypes, along with the respective
epistatic modules rsl929045—rs4885712 (p < 1e — 2) and
rs4805561—rs4932867 (p < 2e — 10). The BMI and WHR medians
are 30.07 and 0.94, respectively, for the first subphenotype (obese)
and 28.23 and 0.91 for the second (lean). The relative sizes of the
obese (0.70 versus 0.65) and lean (0.30 versus 0.35) subphenotypes
as well as the median values of the subphenotypes are close to that
of the Mexico—1 dataset. The exception is WHR, which has a higher
overall mean in the Mexico—2 dataset. BMI phenotype is highly
overlapping in the Mexico—2 dataset, hence the higher P value.
rs8103847, which we chose as proxy for rs4805561, shows a very
significant marginal association, while none of the other three
markers have significant marginal associations. Similar to the
Mexico—1 dataset, analysis of PCA coordinates indicates that the ob—
tained subphenotypes are not due to population stratification
(Supplementary Fig. 511).

We included two proxies for the marginal marker rs1948122 in
the replication experiments: rs1386751 (r2 : 1) and rs2279789
(r2 : 0.85). As expected, the weak marginal association did not rep—
licate in the Mexico—2 dataset, indicating a false positive, which
JBASE correctly classified as a null marker.

4 Discussion

Existing association discovery methods for complex phenotypes do
not account for phenotype heterogeneity and epistasis simultan—
eously. Here, we have demonstrated that ignoring either of these
factors leads to a loss of power in discovery of associations with sub—
phenotype specific effects, especially in the presence of non—additive
variant effects.

Our method, JBASE, is a unified statistical algorithm for infer—
ence of subphenotypes and their associated variants that takes epis—
tasis into account. Instead of tackling the two seemingly unrelated
challenges of missing heritability separately, our probabilistic
model JBASE performs joint inference. JBASE achieves this by
modeling the phenotype as a mixture of subpopulations with dis—
tinct (yet possibly overlapping) distributions. Each of these distri—
butions has its own mixture of null, marginal and epistatic
genotype components. We chose to extend the original BEAM
framework, rather than extending its successors (BEAM2 (Zhang
et al., 2011), BEAM3 (Zhang, 2012), to reduce the complexity and
increase the computational efficiency. We provide an efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo—based inference algorithm along with
improvements in handling LD and population stratification with a
lower computational burden than previous extensions. JBASE is
particularly well suited as a meta—analysis tool for combining can—
didate regions and markers across a variety of cohorts as it in—
creases power for the detection of marginal and epistatic
associations by identifying more homogeneous subpopulations
within these very large cohorts.

Through our detailed experiments, we showed that JBASE out—
performs all existing methods across various disease models and set—
tings of heterogeneity levels, MAF and odds ratios. Applying JBASE
to a real T2D dataset, we were able to discover—and independently
replicate—novel associations that were not discovered in previous
analyses of these datasets.

There are several potential extensions for JBASE. One extension
could be to model subphenotypes as an infinite mixture model,
introducing the capability of automatically detecting the number of
subphenotypes. One must be mindful that such models also come
with additional computational requirements. In such a model,

downstream analysis and validation of a higher number of subphe—
notypes will most likely be a tedious task. As such, a trade—off
should be made between model complexity and feasibility of down—
stream analysis on a case—by—case basis.

To summarize, ]BASE is the first algorithm to tackle modeling of
epistasis and subphenotyping simultaneously. We show that taking
both of these causes of missing heritability into account increases
the power and reduces the Type 1 Error in detecting associations.

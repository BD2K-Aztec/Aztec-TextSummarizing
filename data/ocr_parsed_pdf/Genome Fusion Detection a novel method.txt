ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fusion genes result from genomic rearrangements, such
as deletions, amplifications and translocations. Such rearrangements
can also frequently be observed in cancer and have been postulated
as driving event in cancer development. to detect them, one needs to
analyze the transition region of two segments with different copy
number, the location where fusions are known to occur. Finding
fusion genes is essential to understanding cancer development and
may lead to new therapeutic approaches.

Results: Here we present a novel method, the Genomic Fusion
Detection algorithm, to predict fusion genes on a genomic level
based on SNP-array data. This algorithm detects genes at the transi-
tion region of segments with copy number variation. With the applica-
tion of defined constraints, certain properties of the detected genes
are evaluated to predict whether they may be fused. We evaluated our
prediction by calculating the observed frequency of known fusions in
both primary cancers and cell lines. We tested a set of cell lines posi-
tive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion and prostate cancers positive for the
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. We could detect the fusions in all positive
cell lines, but not in the negative controls.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Motivation

Genomic alterations are changes within the genomic sequence
due to deletions, ampliﬁcations, translocations and other gen-
omic rearrangements. These alterations can affect the balance
of gene regulation networks and thus the proliferation and sur-
vival of cells (Deng et al., 2011). In consequence, genomic alter-
ations are often observed in cancer (Rajagopalan and Lengauer,
2004), now widely accepted as a disease with a strong genetic
component based on the insight that cancer is almost always
accompanied by rather severe changes on the genetic level
(Mitelman et al., 2007). Research in the field of oncogenomics
focuses on such mutation events most likely to result in deregu-
lation (i.e. inactivation or activation) of genes. Inactivation of

tumor suppressor genes, for example, plays a major role in
cancer development (Mitelman et al., 2007).

The ﬁrst detected functional fusion of two genes was found in
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It is a genomic translocation,
generated on chromosome 22 by a translocation of the long arm
of chromosome 9 to chromosome 22, causing a truncated
chromosome 22, the so-called Philadelphia chromosome, and
an elongated chromosome 9. The resulting fusion is named
after the two involved genes, BCR-ABLl. It was shown that
this fusion plays an important role in the development of
CML (Nowell and Hungerford, 1960). Even though the rele-
vance of translocation events in cancer development was pointed
out, it was widely assumed that this is a unique feature of leuke-
mia (Edwards, 2010). One reason for this was the lack of tech-
nologies to detect complex structural rearrangements within the
genome with high resolution. Hence, fusion genes remained un-
explored for some time.

This View changed with the decoding of the human genome
and the associated substantial progress in the development of
laboratory and bioinformatics methods (Chen et al., 2011;
Kearney and Horsley, 2005). The advent of high-throughput
methods like RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) (Chen et al., 2011)
and high-resolution microarrays have enabled accurate descrip-
tions of structural changes within the genome. This advancement
in technology facilitated the detection of further fusions, e. g. the
EML4—ALK fusion (Soda et al., 2007) in lung cancer and the
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (Tomlins et al., 2007) in prostate cancer.
Their identiﬁcation and characterization led to the conclusion
that fusion genes also play an important role in solid cancers,
dramatically changing the interest in fusion genes (Cazzaniga
et al., 2001; Edwards, 2010; Graux et al., 2004). As a conse-
quence, the available information on cancer genomes and their
chromosomal aberrations has increased signiﬁcantly in the past
few years, leading to drugs for inhibiting and diagnostic kits for
detecting them.

Pﬁzer, for example, developed Crizotinib, a drug to inhibit the
ALK part of the EML4—ALK fusion (Bang, 2011). Novartis AG
developed Imatinib (trade-name: Glivec), targeting the protein
encoded by BCR-ABLl and inhibiting the activity of the tyrosine
kinase ABLl (Ohm et al., 2012). Recently, it was shown that
Sorafenib (trade-name: Nexavar, developed by Bayer AG) also
inhibits BCR-ABLl kinase activities, including the Imatinib-
resistant E255K and T3151 mutants of this fusion (Kurosu
et al., 2009). The fusion of the TMPRSS2 gene with E-twenty
six (ETS) family genes like ETVl, ERG and ETV4 occurs in up
to 70% of all prostate cancers and is therefore a specific

biomarker for prostate cancer diagnostics (Perner et al., 2007).
Companies like China Medical Technologies (http://www.china
meditech.com) and KREATECH (http://www.kreatech.com)
have developed kits to detect the fusion of TMPRSS2 with an
ETS family member, increasing the sensitivity of diagnosing
prostate cancer (Perner et al., 2007). The importance of research
in this ﬁeld is shown by the high success rate of these drugs and
diagnostic kits.

1.2 Structural rearrangements

Structural or quantitative changes within the genome are
so-called genomic aberrations. Changes within a chromosome
are called chromosomal aberration. They can, for example, be
detected by examining copy number variations (CNVs). A CNV
is a change in the copy number (CN) of genomic segments
caused by evolutionary events like deletions, amplifications or
translocations (Conrad et al., 2010). Such kinds of aberrations
frequently occur during cancer development and are often unba-
lanced, meaning that there is a quantitative change in genetic
material caused by a mutation event (J ohansson et al., 1996).
The transition region of segments with CNVs is deﬁned as a
change in the CN of two neighboring genomic segments within
a chromosome. It is often referred to as a breakpoint (Ritz et al.,
2011). Notably, by this deﬁnition, a breakpoint is only found in
unbalanced fusion events. It has been proposed that balanced
events most likely occur as early changes, whereas later aberra-
tions in substantial tumors are typically unbalanced (J ohansson
et al., 1996).

Genomic aberrations can be more complex than deletions or
ampliﬁcations. Consider as an example two genes at different
breakpoints, originally coding for two different proteins, merging
to a fusion. The resulting sequence contains the entire or partial
information of both genes, which may lead to a protein with
novel functions (Long, 2000). A fusion causes the change of
the physical genomic position therefore loss of the regulatory
elements of this gene. This may, for example, change the expres-
sion of the involved gene (Huang et al., 2012). The fusion gene
TMPRSS2-ERG, for example, results from a deletion of three
million base pairs. Due to the fusion event, the ERG gene is
regulated by the TMPRSS2 promoter, leading to overexpression
of ERG (Tomlins et al., 2005). However, most of the occurring
fusion genes are non-functional (loss of function of one or both
genes). The functionality of a fusion gene depends on certain cell
properties like the cell type (tissue speciﬁcity), the cell stage
(replication activity) and the mode of action of the translated
protein. In addition, the fusion gene has to fulﬁll certain proper-
ties to encode a functional mRNA, e.g. a cap structure for trans-
port into the cytoplasm, a poly-A tail for the translational
process and the ability to fold into a 3D structure (Salim et al.,
2011; Yanai et al., 2002).

1.3 Related works

Ritz et a]. developed the algorithm ‘Neighborhood Breakpoint
Conservation’ (NBC) (Ritz et al., 2011), which uses the CNV in-
formation from array comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH) (Pinkel and Albertson, 2005) to calculate breakpoints,
a required prerequisite for predicting fusion genes on DNA level.
The output of NBC comprises common breakpoints or pairs of

common breakpoints in a given sample calculated on the basis of
Bayesian statistics. The Bayesian statistic uses conditional prob-
ability to give evidence about the plausibility of an event. The
resulting pairs of common breakpoints can then be used for
fusion detection. The algorithm calculates all possible CN proﬁles
(genomic segmentations), from which breakpoints could be
derived. Next, it calculates the probability of a breakpoint be-
tween two probes, considering all possible CN proﬁles of an indi-
vidual. In the ﬁnal step, NBC combines the calculated
probabilities of all breakpoints from each individual to ﬁnd re-
current breakpoints across all individuals. The results are split into
sets of either single breakpoints or pairs of breakpoints of a probe
or an interval. Ritz et a]. use all identified CN proﬁles of an indi-
vidual to detect breakpoints with a certain probability. Owing to
this approach, the variability in the position of a breakpoint
within a gene or loci can be considered. Hence, pairs of
common breakpoints can be used to detect fusion genes with pos-
itional variability. The advantage of this method is the ability to
find functional and silent fusions. The main disadvantage of using
aCGH microarrays is their low resolution compared with other
technologies, e. g. RNA-seq. Given that CNVs can be located in
small regions of a few hundred base pairs, they will not be detect-
able by methods relying only on low resolution (Perry et al., 2008).

1.4 Contribution

We present Genomic Fusion Detection (GFD), an algorithm to
detect fusion genes on DNA level based on segmentation data
from high-resolution Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human Single
Nucleotide Polymporism (SNP) Array 6.0 (SNP6) data. As
input, we use here segmentation data calculated with the previ-
ously published tool PICNIC (Greenman et al., 2010), based on a
Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (HMM). These data are then
processed within GFD in three steps. In the ﬁrst step, breakpoints
are detected in the predicted segmentations. In the second step,
several constraints are applied to detect fusion genes with certain
properties. In the ﬁnal step, all samples are scanned for common
fusion predictions to reduce false-positive predictions.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Cancer cell lines

We use Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP6 data of 13 cell lines
from three different tissues and different cancer subtypes and of 82 pri-
mary prostate samples. Cell line data were obtained from the Gene Ex-
pression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.n1m.nih.gov/geo) (Accession:
GSE36138) and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (http://www.sanger.
ac.uk). The datasets were divided into two subsets. The ﬁrst subset (Sup-
plementary Table Sl) is a collection of seven BCR-ABLlipositive CML
cell lines (BV-173, EM-2, K-562, LAMA-84, MEG-01, JK-l, KCL-22)
and one BCR-ABLlinegative AML cell line (KG-1) (fusion state accord-
ing to Mahon et al., 2000; Palsson and Masters, 2010). The second subset
(Supplementary Table S2) consists of 44 primary prostate cancer and 38
matched normal samples of two different ethnic backgrounds (39 Chin-
ese; 5 UK), of which one Chinese and four UK samples are
TMPRSS2-ERG7positive according to the source (Mao et al., 2010)
(GEO accession: GSE18333). As reference, six prostate cancer cell lines
(22va, DU145, LNCaP, NCI-H660, PC3, VCaP) were included
(retrieved from the sources referenced above). Each sample is represented
by the data of the respective SNP6 experiment. RNA-seq data for cell line

K-562 was downloaded from the NCBI SRA Database (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/sra) (Accession: SRR018269).

2.2 deF use

deFuse was developed by McPherson et al. (McPherson et al., 2011). This
algorithm detects fusion genes in RNA-seq data. Beside clearly aligned
paired-end reads, ambiguously aligned paired-end reads (see e.g.
Fullwood et al., 2009; Hall and Quinlan, 2012; Maher et al., 2009 for
details on these concepts) are also considered and the most likely align-
ment position of such reads is calculated. deFuse is able to identify gene
fusions with boundaries between known exons as well as between intronic
or intergenic sequences. For validating fusions, several conﬁdence meas-
ures estimating the correctness of each prediction are implemented.

2.3 Copy number prediction

Copy Number Analyzer for GeneChips (CNAG) (Nannya et al., 2005),
dChip (Zhao et al., 2004) and other tools (Korn et al., 2008; Wang et al.,
2007) predict CN (see the review by Pinto et al., 2011). Most of them use
normal tissue as baseline. However, CNV in cancer samples is typically
increased (Cappuuo et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 1997). Given this increase,
most available tools are not suited to detect CNVs in cancer samples
(Lamy et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010). In contrast, PICNIC (http://www.
sangerac.uk/genetics/CGP/Software/PICNIC/) considers the increased
CN in cancer and is therefore our method of choice (Greenman et al.,
2010).

2.4 Genomic Fusion Detection

2.4.] Summary Our GFD algorithm consists of one pre-processing
and three main steps (Fig. 1). In the pre-processing step, SNP6 data are
processed by PICNIC (Release Nov 2010) to get the segmentation of
the data. Our algorithm takes this information from PICNIC as input
(Fig. 1A). It is used to predict fusion genes. The input data are processed
in three steps. In the ﬁrst step, breakpoints are determined in the segmen-
tations, artifacts are deleted and genes located close to a breakpoint are
identiﬁed (Fig. 1B). Then, gene pairs fulﬁlling the required constraints are
detected (Fig. 1C). In the last step, the result for each sample is compared
with the results of all processed samples to ﬁnd common fusion events
and reduce false-positive predictions (Fig. 1D). GFD is based on the ideas
of Ritz et al., extending them by the following features (see Supplemen-
tary Table SS for details).

2.4.2 Filtering and selecting gene candidates In this step, the seg-
ments predicted by PICNIC are selected and the breakpoints on each
chromosome are detected. Segments represented by a single probe are
hard to discern from experimental or algorithmic artifacts. Hence, they
are removed to minimize prediction errors. An artifact is, for example,
characterized by adjacent probes belonging to larger segments with a
differing CN than their surroundings, but similar CN to each other.
For example, the artifact could have a CN of 5, but the respective seg-
ment a CN of 2.

2.4.3 Selecting genes closest to a breakpoint We deﬁne that a
fusion gene consists of a 5’-part of the fusion (upstream gene, or 5’-
gene) and a 3’-part of the fusion (downstream gene, or 3’-gene). The
Genome Reference Consortium Human Reference 37 (GRCh37,
Ensembl rev 65 of Dec 2011) was used for predicting fusions. Each
involved gene must be adjacent to a breakpoint. On the forward strand,
the 3’-part of a fusion occurs downstream of a breakpoint and the 5’-part
of a fusion occurs upstream and vice versa on the backward strand.
Intervals surrounding a breakpoint are scanned for genes out of a set of
21 991 unique Ensembl genes. Two cases are considered how a breakpoint
can be observed in respect to a gene. First, a gene can stretch across one or
more breakpoints, dividing the gene into subsegments. In this case, each of

the subsegments may yield a different CN. If two subsegments are
observed, each will be assigned to a 5’-gene or a 3’-gene. If there are
three or more subsegments, the most upstream subsegment will be classi-
ﬁed as a 5’-gene and the most downstream subsegment as a 3’-gene,
whereas inner subsegments are assigned to both groups. Alternatively,
the sequences of two genes can be fused entirely. Here, it is deﬁned that
the distance of each gene to the nearest breakpoint must be at most 10 kb.
Typically, the average distance of human introns is Skb with a standard
deviation of 4.7724 kb (Sakharkar et al., 2004). Therefore, a non-coding
sequence of at most 20 kb between both genes describing a fusion is feas-
ible. This ensures that the distance between both genes is statistically not
too long to enable function. Based on this constraint, all fusions not nearby
the two sides of breakpoints will be missed by GFD. This is based on the
biological assumption that ‘breakpoints point to the location of directly
cancer-relevant genes’ (Mitelman, 2005) and the technological limitation
that only unbalanced fusions are detectable by SNP6 (Greisman et al.,
2011). Genes fulﬁlling one of these criteria are considered for the next
steps. Once the most likely genes to enter a fusion have been selected,
they are analyzed for the most likely pairing for a fusion, as not any two
genes can form a functional fusion gene, e.g. two genes with opposing
orientation. Therefore, further required constrains are described next.

2.4.4 General required constraints Several features are considered to
identify the most likely gene pairs involved in a fusion. These features are

the maximal difference of the total CN, gene orientation, fusion side,
minimal and maximal length of a fusion and the tendency of probe
intensities in both genes.

The probe intensity values used to calculate a speciﬁc CN show high
variability. This fact is considered by the HMM in PICNIC. The transi-
tion between two CN states depends on the probability given in the
HMM, resulting in a sequence of CN states based on the probe intensity
values and the probabilities calculated for the transition. The CN se-
quence calculated by the Viterbi algorithm applied in the HMM returns
the most likely CN sequence, but there is no guarantee that the calculated
sequence is the true CN sequence. Thus, CNV depends on the probabil-
ities given by the HMM and is therefore not exact. We take this variabil-
ity into account. Still, because both genes of a fusion are physically
joined, their CN should only deviate by a small value. We allow a CN
difference of at most i1 here.

The gene end lying closest to the next breakpoint deﬁnes the fusion
side. Thus, the orientation of the strand at this position is another
constraint.

A further constraint is that the fusion gene must keep a certain length.
Therefore, both a minimal and a maximal acceptable length for a fusion,
described by the shortest and longest gene found in the gene collection are
set as minimal and maximal accepted length of a fusion, respectively.

If two genes are fused, they will be replicated together and we assume
them to be ampliﬁed together. This leads to a constraint, i.e. the trend of
intensities at the fusion region between the 5’-gene and the 3’-gene (border
of a fusion or crossover region). This region is described by seven probes
of each involved fusion subsegment (if a fusion subsegment has less than
seven probes, it is ignored). Intensity values of these probes in the cross-
over region have to be similar. A closer look at any gene interval reveals
that the variance of probe intensities increases proportionally to the CN,
i.e. the variance of the intensities can vary in-between CNs and samples
(Fig. 2). Hence, a simple comparison of average intensities is not possible.
Instead, we calculate smoothed intensities with loess normalization, pro-
ducing a smooth set of values from the intensity values with high vari-
ance. A window of pre-deﬁned size is shifted across these and a
polynomial function is ﬁtted at each data point within the window
(Mount, 2004).

Thus, our approach considers the difference in each gene interval’s
variance. To optimize the smoothing, the span is calculated individually
for each fusion candidate. The analysis performed here relies on the
small-sample-size corrected Akaike information criterion (AICC) because
it is robust and accounts for a bias in small datasets. The optimal span is
the minimal span that best ﬁts the polynomial function of the loess nor-
malization. This optimization is done iteratively over an interval for 2%,
3%, and so forth, to 95% of the data points. The intensity trend in their
hypothesized border region for both candidate genes for a fusion is the
best indication for the feasibility of a fusion and can be described by
Pearson correlation. Given that the border interval is supported by
seven probes of each gene, Pearson correlation is comparable between

possible gene combinations. If the absolute correlation between both
intervals is >0.9, the gene pair is still a valid candidate. A gene pair
fulﬁlling all above constraints is reported as fusion candidate and will
be validated next.

2.4.5 Evaluation of likely fusion candidates The previous analysis
steps lead to a list of all possible fusion candidates for each sample. This
list is scanned for candidates common to at least two samples, termed
‘group’ hereafter. Every group will be evaluated separately. To ensure the
prediction of fusion genes with similar segment positions and sizes, the
subsegments of a fusion of each group are ﬁltered for similar start and
end positions using the genomic positions of each fusion. Owing to vari-
ability of the segment positions within a fusion gene caused by break-
points (truncated gene) within intron regions, at least two positions have
to be equal, e.g. the start position of the 5’-gene and the end position of
the 3’-gene over all group members. Next, the variability of all other
positions is analyzed. Therefore, the Euclidean distance of the
non-conserved positions of a fusion subsegment is calculated for the re-
spective position across all group members. Hierarchical clustering with
complete linkage is applied on the distance matrix to either classify the
fusion into different subgroups, which are determined by the distance
among each other, or to discard a sample because it does not contain
the fusion. Additionally, the median sequence length of the group is
calculated. Each fusion event will receive an individual range from calcu-
lating the median sequence length of this particular fusion event across all
samples. Fusions with a distance >40% of the median sequence length to
the other cluster members will be discarded. The threshold of 40% was
chosen to ensure certain variability in fusion length, considering variabil-
ity within the length of fusion genes resulting from breakpoints within
intron regions. Only subgroups of at least two samples will be considered
for further analysis (Fig. 3 for an example). The resulting groups and
subgroups are predicted as fusion genes.

The root mean squared difference (RMS) of the smoothed intensities
surrounding the fusion border is calculated as an additional feature. It
describes the distance between the smoothed border intensities from the
upstream and downstream gene partner of a fusion. If this value is close
to zero, a consistent crossover between both genes is observed. If a higher
RMS is observed, it may imply a false-positive fusion. However, the CNs
of both genes have to be considered for interpreting the RMS because the
intensity variance increases with increasing CN. Hence, if high CN is

observed, a higher RMS can also imply a true-positive fusion yielding an
additional parameter for evaluating fusion genes.

3 RESULTS

The BCR-ABL1 fusion was predicted to exist in all BCR-ABLli
positive cell lines (Table 1), but not in the BCR-ABLlinegative
cell line KG—l (Supplementary Table S4), as there were no break-
points in BCR or ABL1 detected (Supplementary Table S5).
Both segments of the BCR-ABL1 fusion, within the BCR-
ABLlipositive cell lines differ in their CN. The CN of both
segments is inconsistent across the cell lines. Most of them
have a CN between two and five except K-562, which sets
itself apart from the others with a CN of 13 for the BCR part
and a CN of 12 for the ABL1 part. The absolute correlation
coefficient is 0.999 for the BCR-ABL1 fusion in all cell lines.
An RMS of 0.7 can be observed for the crossover region of
the BCR-ABL1 fusion in K-562 owing to the high CN. In the
other cell lines, the RMS is smaller. Given that the BCR-ABL1
fusion results from a translocation of the long arm of chromo-
some 9 to chromosome 22 and vice versa, there is a BCR-ABL1
fusion on chromosome 22 and an ABL1-BCR fusion on chromo-
some 9. The ABLl-BCR fusion was predicted in ﬁve of seven
BCR-ABLlipositive cell lines. The CN of all predictions is
between one and three with a correlation coefﬁcient of at
least 0.98. It can be observed that the CN of both parts
from the ABL1-BCR fusion is continuously lower than in
the CML-characteristic fusion BCR-ABL1. This is especially
true for the CN of the ABL1-BCR fusion in K-562, which has
a CN of three for the ABL1 and two for the BCR part and a
RMS of 0.7.

The ABL1-BCR fusion was predicted in six cell lines shown in
Figure 3, but there are only two subgroups with three and two
members reported (Table 2) because the cell line KCL—22 is dis-
carded owing to the constraint that the distance between two
fusions of one group has to be at most 40% of the median se-
quence length.

Table 2 also shows that the start and end positions of this
fusion are conserved, whereas the positions within the fusion
border vary. The positions of BV-173, MEG-01 and K-562 lie
close together, whereas the positions of EM-2 and LAMA-84
differ from the other cell lines. This observation conﬁrms the
clustering analysis in Figure 3. The main differences are in the

Prediction of the BCR—ABL1 fusion in cell lines. The 5’—gene and 3’—gene of the
fusion corresponds to the BCR and ABL1 segment, respectively.

end position of the ABL1 part, leading to two groups of
ABL1-BCR fusions in the clustering.

To estimate the quality of SNP6-based fusion prediction, the
results of GFD are compared with deFuse, an algorithm detect-
ing fusion proteins in RNA-seq data. deFuse detected 11 fusions
in cell line K-562, but only the BCR-ABL1 fusion was detected
by both algorithms. The start and end position of the BCR seg-
ment differ ~4 kb and ~87 bp, respectively. The ABL1 segment
differs ~119 kb at the start position and ~1.5 kb at the end pos-
ition. The fusion length is 258 798 bp for the GFD prediction and
144 320 bp for the deFuse prediction, which is a difference of
114478 bp. deFuse did not ﬁnd the ABL1-BCR fusion. Probe
intensities of the BCR and the ABL1 gene in K-562 are shown in
Supplementary Figure S1. The main parts of BCR (80 probes)
and ABL1 (245 probes) deﬁne the BCR-ABL1 fusion, whereas
the ABL1-BCR fusion is deﬁned by the smaller remaining parts
[17 probes (ABL1) and 20 probes (BCR)]. Three other interchro-
mosomal fusions were found in two BCR-ABLlipositive cell
lines, but none in all (Supplementary Table S4). No common
intrachromosomal fusion was found. BCR-ABLlinegative
KG-l has no fusion in common with any other cell line
(Supplementary Table S4).

We found the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in NCI-H660, but not
in any other prostate cancer cell line (Supplementary Table S6).
In the primary prostate samples, we veriﬁed the fusion in all
fusion-positive samples (i.e. SH32, P9, P55, P68 and P98), but
not in any of the matched normal samples or in sample SH36
(Supplementary Table S6). The latter harbors a deletion in
21q22.3, but not across 21q22.2 and 22.3 required to constitute
the fusion (Fig. 4).

One of the primary prostate cancer samples is seen as outlier in
the clustering (Fig. 5) due to a violation of a constraint (>40% of
the median sequence length and no other sample with a fusion of
similar length). Here, we found an atypical stretch of the fusion
across both genes not seen in any other sample.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Here we present for the ﬁrst time our novel development, the
GFD algorithm. This algorithm uses the high resolution of SNP6
microarrays for detecting gene fusions. The GFD algorithm de-
tects functional fusion genes from unbalanced mutation events in
cancer. We show that the algorithm’s accuracy is comparable
with deFuse, detecting fusion genes from RNA-seq data. The
comparison showed that the BCR-ABL1 fusion can be found
with both approaches. Differing start positions of ABL1 can
be explained by the missing intron sequences within the data
used by deFuse. From this, it follows that both approaches pre-
dict the same BCR-ABL1 fusion. The ABL1-BCR fusion was
only predicted by GFD because the ABL1-BCR fusion is typic-
ally not expressed (Uphoff et al., 1999). Owing to the fundamen-
tal differences in data types, it is not our scope to benchmark
DNA-microarrays against RNA-seq. Still, using a high-reso-
lution DNA-microarray enables predicting fusion genes that
are not expressed, i.e. not detectable by RNA-seq. Deep
next-generation sequencing may alter this situation, but the
cost-advantage of our approach is currently >10—f old in contrast.
In addition, GFD is able to detect non-functional, silenced and
novel fusions.

prostate cancer samples. SH32 yields the characteristic deletion required
to form the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, whereas SH36 has only a partial
deletion

For evaluation, seven BCR-ABLlipositive CML cell lines
(Mahon et al., 2000; Uphoff et al., 1999) and one BCR-ABLli
negative AML cell line (Hochhaus et al., 1996) were used. It was
shown that GFD predicts the BCR-ABL1 fusion in all
BCR-ABLlipositive cell lines. The breakpoint positions of
BCR-ABL1 within cell line K-562 on chromosome 22 and
chromosome 9 found by GFD are close to the published pos-
itions (Shibata et al., 2010). The ABL1-BCR fusion formed on
chromosome 9 was predicted in five of seven cell lines. There is a
chance that a gene will still be normally expressed even though it
participates in a fusion, owing to a second copy of the same gene
that is not involved in a fusion (Uphoff et al., 1999). This could
explain the CN difference within the segments of the BCR-ABL1
and ABL1-BCR fusions. In the EM-2 cell line, the CN of the
BCR part in both fusions is higher than CN of the ABL1 part in
both fusions. This can also be observed within the BCR-ABL1
and ABL1-BCR fusion in K-562. However, in this case, an RMS

Fig. 5. The dendrogram shows the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion’s hierarchical

zontal line describes the threshold of 40% of the median sequence length.
Sample P98 deviates from this threshold and is therefore considered an
outlier

of 0.7 is observed in both fusions. The difference in the border
region indicates least one BCR and one ABL1 gene expressing
normal transcripts.

As expected, TMPRSS2-ERG fusions could not be detected in
negative prostate cancer cell lines PC3, LNCaP, DU145 and
22va, but rather unexpectedly also not in VCaP. This cell line
is known to harbor at least one normal TMPRSS2 and ERG
gene, making it difficult to study the fusion in vitro (Mertz et al.,
2007). In a clinical dataset of 82 primary prostate samples,
we could successfully identify all previously described fusion-
positive samples. One of these samples contains the typical dele-
tion, but also unusually long parts of both fusion partners,
rendering it an outlier.

We have shown that GFD is able to detect functional fusion
genes, deriving from unbalanced mutation events in cancer. In
addition, we have shown that GFD has a similar accuracy as an
approach to detect fusion genes based on RNA-seq. A future
application of GFD could be combined run with an
RNA-seq-based algorithm. In this case, one can distinguish be-
tween functional and non-functional fusions. Also, transcrip-
tional and translational position information of the fusion
could be gained. Thus, it would become possible to predict

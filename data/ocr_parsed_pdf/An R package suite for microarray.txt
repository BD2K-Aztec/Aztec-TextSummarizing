ABSTRACT

Summary: With the rapid advances and prevalence of high-
throughput genomic technologies, integrating information of multiple
relevant genomic studies has brought new challenges. Microarray
meta-analysis has become a frequently used tool in biomedical re-
search. Little effort, however, has been made to develop a systematic
pipeline and user-friendly software. In this article, we present
MetaOmics, a suite of three R packages MetaQC, MetaDE and
MetaPath, for quality control, differentially expressed gene identifica-
tion and enriched pathway detection for microarray meta-analysis.
MetaQC provides a quantitative and objective tool to assist study in-
clusion/exclusion criteria for meta-analysis. MetaDE and MetaPath
were developed for candidate marker and pathway detection, which
provide choices of marker detection, meta-analysis and pathway ana-
lysis methods. The system allows flexible input of experimental data,
clinical outcome (case—control, multi-class, continuous or survival) and
pathway databases. It allows missing values in experimental data and
utilizes multi-core parallel computing for fast implementation. It gen-
erates informative summary output and visualization plots, operates
on different operation systems and can be expanded to include new
algorithms or combine different types of genomic data. This software
suite provides a comprehensive tool to conveniently implement and
compare various genomic meta-analysis pipelines.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many high-throughput genomic technologies have advanced
dramatically in the past decade. Microarray experiment is one

example that has evolved into maturity with generally consensus
experimental protocols and data analysis strategies. Its extensive
application in the biomedical ﬁeld has led to an explosion of gene
expression profiling studies publicly available. Meta-analysis
methods for combining multiple microarray studies have been
widely applied to increase statistical power and provide validated
conclusions (Tseng et al., 2012). In this article, we present the
‘MetaOmics’ software suite that contains three unified R pack-
agesiMetaQC, MetaDE and MetaPathifor systematic micro-
array meta-analysis pipeline. The MetaQC (Kang et al., 2012)
package provides a quantitative and objective tool for determin-
ing the inclusion/exclusion criteria for meta-analysis. MetaDE
contains many state-of-the-art genomic meta-analysis methods
to detect differentially expressed genes. Finally, the MetaPath
package (Shen and Tseng, 2010) provides a uniﬁed meta-analysis
framework and inference to detect enriched pathways associated
with outcome.

2 THE THREE R PACKAGES

The three R packages in MetaOmics allow ﬂexible input format
of experimental data and four different types of outcome vari-
ables (caseicontrol, multi-class, continuous and survival). They
also allow missing values in the individual experimental study or
missing values caused by mismatched genes across studies (i.e.
genes covered in one study but not covered in another study).
For some computationally intensive routines, the packages allow
usage of multi-core parallel computing for timely implementa-
tion. Detailed help ﬁles, tutorial and a case study are available in
an online supplementary document as well as in the R packages.
Below, we brieﬂy describe features and functionality of the three
packages.

2.1 MetaQC

MetaQC calculates the following six quantitative quality control
(QC) measures: internal homogeneity of co-expression structure

among studies (IQC), external consistency of co-expression pat-
tern with pathway database (EQC) and accuracy and consistency
of differentially expressed gene detection (AQCg and CQCg) or
enriched pathway identiﬁcation (AQCp and CQCp). Each QC
index is deﬁned as the minus log-transformed P—Values from
formal hypothesis testing in each QC criterion. Principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) biplots and standardized mean ranks are
ﬁnally generated to assist Visualization and decision. The identi-
ﬁed problematic studies are suggested for further inspection to
detect potential technical or biological causes of their low quality
and to determine their exclusion from meta-analysis.

2.2 MetaDE

MetaDE package implements 12 major meta-analysis methods
for differential expression (DE) analysis: Fisher (Rhodes et al.,
2002), Stouffer, adaptively weighted statistic (AW) (Li and
Tseng, 2011), minimum P—Value (minP), maximum P—Value
(maxP), rth ordered P—Value (rOP) (Song and Tseng, 2012),
ﬁxed effects model (FEM), random effects model (REM)
(Choi et al., 2003), rank product (rankProd), rank sum
(rankSum) (Hong et al., 2006), naive sum of ranks and naive
product of ranks. Detailed algorithms, pros and cons of different
methods have been discussed in a recent review article (Tseng
et al., 2012). Two additional considerations are involved in the
implementation: (i) different choices of test statistics are available
for different outcome variables, for example t—statistics, F—statis-
tics, minimum multi-class correlation (Lu et al., 2010), linear
regression, correlation coefficient and log-rank test; (ii) one-sided
test correction may be needed to exclude genes with discordant
DE direction (e.g. up-regulation in one study but down-
regulation in another study). MetaDE also provides options
for gene matching across studies and gene filtering before
meta-analysis. Outputs of the meta-analysis results include DE
gene lists with corresponding raw P—Values, q-Values and various
Visualization tools. Heatmaps can be plotted across studies.

2.3 MetaPath

MetaPath implements three meta-analysis framework for path-
way enrichment analysis: MAPE_G, MAPE_P and MAPE_I
(Shen and Tseng, 2010). Meta-analyses for pathway enrichment
are integrated either at the gene level (MAPE_G) or at the path-
way level (MAPE_P). For MAPE_G, information across studies
is combined at the gene level and then pathway enrichment ana-
lysis is applied. Conversely, for MAPE_P, pathway analysis is
ﬁrst performed in each study independently. The information
across studies is then combined at the pathway level. Since
MAPE_G and MAPE_P have been found with complementary
advantages under different data structure, a hybrid framework
(MAPE_I) has been developed. Similar to MetaDE, MetaPath
also provides multiple options of gene matching, gene filtering,
meta-analysis methods and test statistics to associate with
outcomes.

Supplementary Figure S1 shows a workﬂow diagram of
meta-analysis pipeline using the three packages. After data are
preprocessed, MetaQC is applied to determine inclusion/exclu-
sion criteria. MetaDE and MetaPath are then used to detect
candidate markers or pathways associated with disease outcome.

3 PROSTATE CANCER EXAMPLE

To demonstrate application of MetaQC, MetaDE and
MetaPath, we collected nine prostate cancer studies (Welsh,
Yu, Lapointe, Varambally, Singh, Wallace, Nanni, Tomlins
and Dhanasekaran), which contained normal and primary
cancer samples. After gene matching by ofﬁcial gene symbols,
preprocessing and filtering, 4441 genes were used for
meta-analysis. Figure 1A shows result of the MetaQC PCA
biplot. Three of the nine studies (Nanni, Tomlins and
Dhanasekaran) were determined with lower quality and were
removed from meta-analysis. Figure 1B shows the number of
detected DE genes under different FDR threshold in the remain-
ing six single study analysis and meta-analyses by Fisher, maxP,
rOP (r: 4) and AW methods. It is clear that meta-analysis usu-
ally detects more candidate markers, except for maxP. Finally,
Figure 1C and D shows a heatmap of detected pathways
(q—Value<0.2 in any method) and Venn diagram of pathways
detected by MAPE_P, MAPE_G and MAPE_I using
MetaPath. The majority of the detected pathways appeared to
be cancer related. Single-study analyses showed very weak path-
way enrichment; MAPE_P and MAPE_G appeared to have
complementary detection power (identiﬁed 23 and 15 pathways
with only 5 in common). MAPE_I detected the largest number of
pathways (34 pathways).

Abstract

Summary: Annotating genetic variants, especially non—coding variants, for the purpose of identifying
pathogenic variants remains a challenge. Combined annotation—dependent depletion (CADD) is an al—
gorithm designed to annotate both coding and non—coding variants, and has been shown to outper—
form other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to dif—
ferentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants.
However, SVMs cannot capture non—linear relationships among the features, which can limit per—
formance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and
training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture non—linear relation—
ships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples
and features. We exploit Compute Unified Device Architecture—compatible graphics processing units
and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN train—
ing. DANN achieves about a 19% relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14% relative increase
in the area underthe curve (AUC) metric over CADD’s SVM methodology.

1 Introduction

Identifying the genetic variants responsible for diseases can be very
challenging. The majority of candidate variants lie in non-coding
sections of the genome, whose role in maintaining normal genome
function is not well understood. Most annotation methods can only
annotate protein coding variants, excluding >98% of the human
genome. Another annotation method, combined annotation—-
dependent depletion (CADD; Kircher et (11., 2014), can annotate
both coding and non-coding variants. CADD trains a linear kernel
support vector machine (SVM) to separate observed genetic variants
from simulated genetic variants. Observed genetic variants
are derived from differences between human genomes and the
inferred human—chimpanzee ancestral genome. Because of natural
selection effects, observed variants are depleted of deleterious

variants. Simulated genetic variants are enriched for deleterious
variants.

CADD’s SVM can only learn linear representations of the data,
which limits its performance. To overcome this, we implemented a
deep neural network (DNN) algorithm that we have named deleteri-
ous annotation of genetic variants using neural networks (DANN). A
DNN is an artificial neural network with several hidden layers of
units between the input and output layers. The extra layers give a
DNN-added level of abstraction, but can greatly increase the
computational time needed for training. Deep learning techniques
and graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware can significantly reduce
the computational time needed to train DNNs. DNNs outperform
simpler linear approaches such as logistic regression (LR) and SVMs
for classification problems involving many features and samples.

is small. Given DANN’s superior performance for annotating
non—coding variants, which comprise the overwhelming majority of
genetic variation, we expect DANN to play an important role in pri—
oritizing putative causal variants, such as those derived from
GWAS, for further downstream analysis.

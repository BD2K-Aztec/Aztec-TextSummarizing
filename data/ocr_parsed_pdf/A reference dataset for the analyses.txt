ABSTRACT

Motivation: Empirical analyses of protein secondary structures
based on circular dichroism (CD) and synchrotron radiation circular
dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopic data rely on the availability of
reference datasets comprised of spectra of relevant proteins, whose
crystal structures have been determined. Datasets comprised of only
soluble proteins have not proven suitable for analysing the spectra
of membrane proteins.

Results: A new reference dataset, MP180, has been created
containing the spectra of 30 membrane proteins encompassing the
secondary structure and fold space covered by all known membrane
protein structures. In addition a mixed soluble and membrane
protein dataset, SMP180, has been created, which includes 98
soluble protein spectra (SP) plus the MP180 spectra. Calculations
of both membrane and soluble protein secondary structures using
SMP180 are significantly improved with respect to those produced,
using soluble protein-only datasets. The SMP180 dataset also
enables determination of the percentage of transmembrane residues,
thus enhancing the information previously obtainable from CD
spectroscopy.

Availability and Implementation: Reference dataset online at
the DichroWeb analysis server (http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk);
individual protein spectra in the Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank
(http://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk).

1 INTRODUCTION

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is an important method in
structural biology with applications that include determination of
protein secondary structure content, detection of protein folding and
unfolding, protein stability, formation of macromolecular complexes
and Characterisation of ligand—protein interactions. Synchrotron
radiation Circular dichroism (SRCD) instruments have enhanced

the technique by producing data to lower wavelengths with higher
information contents and improved signal-to-noise levels relative to
those obtained using conventional bench-top instruments.

The use of CD as an analytical tool for protein secondary
structure analyses relies on empirical algorithms (Chen and Yang,
1971; Brahms and Brahms, 1979; Hennessey and Johnson, 1981;
Wallace and Teeters, 1987; Pancoska and Keiderling, 1991 ; Johnson,
1999; Sreerama and Woody, 2000) and associated spectral reference
datasets derived from proteins with known structures. The accuracies
of such analyses are dependant upon the range of structural and
spectral Characteristics of the constituent proteins in the reference
dataset and how representative those proteins are of the types
of structures present in the proteins being analysed (Janes, 2005;
Whitmore and Wallace, 2008).

Most reference databases were developed sometime ago for the
analysis of soluble proteins (Johnson, 1999; Sreerama and Woody,
2000; Sreerama et a1. , 2000). More recently, a large reference dataset
of soluble proteins, designated SP175 consisting of 71 soluble
protein spectra (SP) with a low wavelength limit of 175 nm [achieved
using an SRCD instrument], was created based on bioinformatics
considerations (Lees et (11., 2006a). It produces enhanced predictive
accuracies for CD data in comparison with the previous reference
datasets as a result of its extensive coverage of secondary structure
and fold space.

Membrane proteins make up approximately one-quarter to one-
third of the proteins encoded by the currently sequenced genomes
and they carry out important cellular functions, making them major
targets for pharmaceutical drug development. However compared
to soluble proteins, membrane proteins are under-represented in
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2007), because they
are difﬁcult to crystallise and they tend to be too large for NMR
studies; therefore, developing other methods for their structural
Characterisation is important.

Analyses of membrane protein CD and SRCD spectra using
reference datasets based solely on soluble proteins generally do
not yield predictions as reliable as those for soluble proteins
(Wallace et (11., 2003). It is likely that this is because membrane
proteins are embedded in environments of low dielectric constant,
either detergent micelles or lipid vesicles, which can inﬂuence the
relative ground and excited states of the electronic transitions of the
peptide backbones relative to those in aqueous solutions (Cascio
and Wallace, 1995; Chen and Wallace, 1997). It has been suggested
that the inclusion of membrane proteins in a soluble protein dataset

Membrane protein dataset

 

will enhance its predictive performance when analysing membrane
prouﬁns(VvaﬂaceetaL,2003;Sreenunaand\NOody,2004),butunﬁl
now the number of available membrane protein spectra with cognate
high quality crystal structures has been very limited.

In this study, we created a reference dataset designated MP180
consisting of 30 SRCD spectra of membrane proteins whose
crystal structures are known, and which were examined under
their crystallisation conditions. A larger dataset containing both
membrane and soluble proteins, designated SMP180, was also
produced. It contains the proteins from MP180 and a further 98
soluble protein spectra [including those in SP175 (Lees et (11.,
2006a)]. SMP180 was speciﬁcally created to improve the analyses
of membrane proteins with large ecto-domains. SMP180 not only
produces more accurate predictions of membrane protein secondary
structures than can be achieved using soluble-only protein datasets;
it also produces improved secondary structure analyses of soluble
proteins, especially for their beta-sheet contents.

2 METHODS

2.1 Criteria for protein selection

A list of unique membrane protein crystal structures was obtained by cross-
referencing the ‘The Membrane Proteins of Known 3D Structure” web site
(accession date 07/06/10) (http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/Membrane_Proteins
_xtal.html) (White. 2004) with the PISCES server (http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/
Guoli/PISCES_InputB.php) (Wang and Dunbrack. 2003). which deﬁnes
unique polypeptides. using a >30% sequence identity cutoff; this list is
referred to as the all membrane proteins (AMP) dataset. Only proteins whose
structures were determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 3.5 A
or better were included. It is comprised of 183 proteins and includes 286
polypeptide chains from a starting list of 613 proteins and 2685 chains. It
was used to evaluate the representative nature of the membrane proteins used
in this study.

Membrane protein targets for the MP180 dataset were selected on the
basis of coverage of secondary structure space from alpha/beta plots (Lees
et (11.. 2006a) and fold space based on CATH architecture classiﬁcations
(Orengo 21111.. 1997). as well as availability. Coordinate ﬁles for the selected
membrane proteins were obtained from the PDB. Where possible. the cognate
PDB ﬁle for the structure produced by the lab that provided the sample was
used. If there was more than one structure available for that protein. then the
PDB ﬁle was selected based. in order. on the following criteria: (i) highest
resolution; (ii) lowest R factor; and (iii) highest overall G-factor score as
deﬁned by PROCHECK (Laskowski et (11.. 1993).

The Deﬁne Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) algorithm (Kabsch
and Sander. 1983) was used to calculate secondary structure contents
from the PDB ﬁles Via the 2Struc web server (Klose et (11.. 2010). The
‘principal’ secondary structure assignments used were: helices [alpha helix
(H )+ 310 helix (G)]. ﬁ-sheets (E) and other (0) (which includes all remaining
secondary structure types). The ‘alternate’ secondary structure assignments
(Sreerama and Woody. 2000) of regular alpha helix (01R). distorted alpha helix
(010). regular beta sheet (13R). distorted beta sheet (130). turn and unordered
(U) were also used. The 010 fraction includes two residues from both ends of
each helix and any helix that is < 4 residues in length. The 01R fraction consists
of all remaining helical residues. The 130 fraction includes one residue from
both ends of each ﬁ-sheet. and all residues in a ﬁ-sheet that is Z 2 residues
in length. The 13R fraction includes all remaining ﬁ-sheet residues. The turn
class is created by combining the DSSP turn (T) and bend (S) classiﬁcations.
Residues with missing backbone electron density and all remaining residues
not included in any of the above classes were assigned to the unordered
fraction.

To assign the transmembrane (TM) fractions. the topology prediction web
site MEMSAT (Jones. 2007) was used for the alpha helical-rich membrane

proteins. and the transmembrane beta-barrel prediction server PROthb
(Bigelow et (11.. 2004) for the beta sheet-rich membrane proteins. The
transmembrane helix (TMh). extramembrane helix (EMh). transmembrane
sheet (TM/3) and extramembrane sheet (EM/3) fractions were separately
deﬁned in order to determine if it would be possible to discriminate between
secondary structures found in transmembrane and ecto-regions of a protein.
The TMh fraction included residues from membrane spanning helices. All
remaining helical residues were assigned to the EMh fraction. The TMﬁ
fraction is comprised of membrane spanning ﬁ-sheet residues. The EMﬁ
fraction contains all remaining ﬁ-sheet residues. Any residues not in the
preceding classes were included in the non-helix. non-sheet (N) fraction.

Fold classiﬁcations were obtained from the CATH database (Orengo
et (11.. 1997). CATH classiﬁcations for unassigned proteins were derived
from homologous chains acquired through the sequence navigator tool on the
PDBj web site (Standley et (11.. 2008). The correlation between the secondary
structure space coverage by the MP180 and AMP datasets was determined
by collecting the percentage helix versus sheet secondary structures into 100
‘ten percentile” groups (e.g. (L999. 1&1999. etc.) of the alpha/beta plots.
followed by calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient. r. (Pearson.
1896) for these groups.

2.2 Materials

Protein samples were. in general. obtained from the labs that had determined
the crystal structures (Supplementary Tables Sl. S2). ensuring that the same
proteins were used for the crystallography and spectroscopic measurements.
and that the spectroscopic sample conditions were consistent with the
crystallisation conditions (Supplementary Table S3). Five proteins (AmtB.
GlpG. ClC-ecl. BtuCD and the NpSRII + NthRII complex) were dialysed
before measuring their spectra in order to exchange the highly absorbing
NaCl in their buffers with equivalent buffers containing NaF instead (Miles
and Wallace. 2006). To remove any insoluble material. all samples were
centrifuged at 12 800g for 30 5 just prior to use.

The protein concentration of each sample was determined from the
absorbance at 280 nm. using a Nanodrop 1000 UV/Vis spectrophotometer.
Measurements were repeated ﬁve times and averaged. The absorbance values
obtained had variances of ~1%. The calculated extinction coefﬁcients
were obtained from the protein sequence using the ProtParam tool on the
EXPASY web site (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html) (Gasteiger
21111.. 2003). Concentrations used in the CD and SRCD measurements ranged
from 1.0 to 20.0 mg/ml. In general. the beta sheet-rich proteins required
higher concentrations as their spectral magnitudes tend to be smaller than
those of alpha helical-rich proteins. Sample and spectroscopic conditions are
listed in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Table S3).

2.3 Spectroscopic measurements

SRCD measurements were carried out on beamlines UVl and CD1 at
ISA (Denmark). on stations 3.1 and CD12 at the Synchrotron Radiation
Source (SRS) Daresbury (UK) and on the DISCO beamline at the Soleil
Synchrotron (France). In a number of cases. replicate measurements were
carried out on more than one beamline or on an AViV 62ds conventional CD
spectrophotometer to demonstrate cross-validity. reproducibility and that the
samples were unaffected by transport to the beamlines.

SRCD spectra were measured at 20° C over a wavelength range from 280
to 170 nm. The following instrumental parameters were used at UVl and
CD1: 1 nm interval. 1 nm bandwidth. 2 s averaging time. Parameters used at
CD12 and DISCO were identical. except the averaging times were 1 whilst
at station 3.1 the parameters were 0.2 nm interval. 1 nm bandwidth and 3
s averaging. Spectra were measured on the AViV CD instrument under the
same conditions as at UVl/CDl. except over a wavelength range from 280
to 185 nm and using an averaging time of 3 5.

Measurements were carried out using quartz cylindrical demountable
Suprasil (Hellma UK Ltd) cells with pathlengths ranging from 0.0015
to 0.0050 cm. or specially designed calcium ﬂuoride cells (Wien and

Wallace. 2005) with pathlengths ranging from 0.0004 to 0.0022 cm. Accurate
determinations of the cell pathlengths were achieved by employing the
interference fringe method. as described previously (Miles at 111.. 2005).
Pathlengths were chosen to optimise the CD signal. whilst not exceeding the
high tension (HT) or high voltage signal cutoffs of instruments. as described
in Miles and Wallace (2006). Three spectra of each sample and of each
baseline (buffer and detergent without protein) were measured and averaged.
The ﬁrst and third scans were compared to establish that no beam-induced
denaturation of the protein had occurred (Wien et (11.. 2005). The averaged
baseline spectrum was subtracted from the averaged sample spectrum and
then smoothed with a Savitskinolay ﬁlter (Savitsky and Golay. 1964). Data
processing was carried out using CDtool software (Lees et (11.. 2004) and
spectra were plotted in A8 units. using the mean residue weight values listed
in Supplementary Table S3. All instruments were calibrated for both spectral
magnitude and optical rotation using camphour-lO-sulfonic acid (CSA) and
for wavelength with either benzene vapour or a certiﬁed holmium oxide glass
ﬁlter (Hellma UK Ltd) (Miles at 111.. 2003. 2005); in the case of the SRCD
beamlines. fresh CSA calibration spectra were obtained following each beam
injection.

2.4 Creation of reference datasets

Thirty membrane protein spectra were used to create the MP180 (meaning:
Membrane Proteins. low wavelength cutoff 180 nm) reference dataset. The
combined soluble and membrane protein dataset. referred to as SMP180. was
created by combining the MP180 dataset with the SP180 dataset. a modiﬁed
version of the original SP175 dataset (Lees et (11.. 2006a). where the 71
protein spectra were truncated to 180 nm to produce a wavelength range
consistent with the membrane protein spectra(SP175,130). and supplemented
with an additional 27 soluble proteins (Supplementary Table S4).

Following publication. the SMP180 reference dataset will be made
available as a reference dataset option on the DichroWeb (Whitmore
and Wallace. 2008) analysis server (http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/). In
addition. as we have done for the SP175 dataset. the individual spectra
will be available in the Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank (PCDDB)
(http://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk) (Whitmore et (11.. 2010. 2011). indicated by
the keywords ‘MP180’ and ‘SMP180’.

To determine the accuracy of the secondary structure calculations. the
‘leave one out” cross-validation method was employed. as previously
described (Lees et (11.. 2006a). In the predictive performance analyses.
likewise the cognate membrane protein spectrum was removed from
the SMP180 dataset. The analyses were carried out in MATLAB using
SELMAT3 (Lees et (11.. 2006b). a modiﬁed version of the SELCON3
algorithm (Sreerama and Woody. 2000). which enabled larger numbers of
reference spectra and relaxed constraints to be used. Validation performances
were quantiﬁed using Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (r). the root mean
squared deviation (8) and the g‘ parameter (Oberg et (11.. 2004). which
represents how much better than random a prediction is and can be
determined by dividing the 8 value by the population standard deviation
(0),). Principal component analyses were undertaken using the Csel2
implementation in CDtools (Lees et (11.. 2004). which is based on the singular
value deconvolution method of Hennessey and Johnson (1981). The spectra
of the mostly helical proteins (as deﬁned by their CATH classiﬁcation)
from the MP180 and SP180 datasets were separately analysed and the peak
positions of the ﬁrst basis sets calculated for each were compared.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Spectral data

The spectra of 35 membrane proteins were initially measured and of
these, 30 were deemed suitable for inclusion in the MP180 dataset
(Supplementary Table S1) based on the criteria of low noise levels
(<0.3A8 between positive and negative peaks between 250 and
270 nm), high reproducibility (< 2% difference between the values

at ~ 190 nm for repeat scans) and a low wavelength cutoff of at least
180 nm (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The MP180 proteins form three groups: mainly alpha helical
(> 40% helical content), mainly beta sheet (> 40% sheet content)
and mixed alpha/beta (Fig. 1). There is a good overlap between
the coverage of the AMP and the MP180 datasets (Fig. 2), with a
correlation coefﬁcient, r, of 0.91.

3.2 Characteristics of the MP180 Proteins

The MP180 dataset covers proteins with a wide range of structures
and functions, making it a representative sample of the types of the
membrane proteins whose crystal structures were known at the time
of writing. Eighteen proteins are multimeric, 8 of which are homo-
multimers and 12 are monomeric. The functional roles of the MP180
proteins include host cell recognition by bacterial pathogens, G-
protein coupled receptors, electron transport within photosynthetic
and respiratory pathways, ﬂux of ions and toxic substances and
active uptake of nutrients and ligands. The majority of the MP180
samples was from prokaryotic sources, with four eukaryotic proteins
included.

Tryptophan residues are considered to play a signiﬁcant role
in anchoring a membrane protein within the lipid bilayer, so the

coverage of their content in the dataset was checked. The MP180
proteins contain between 1% and 5% tryptophan residues, with
an average of 2%. Correspondingly, tryptophan residues are, on
average, 2% of residues in the AMP proteins.

The percentage of residues in transmembrane segments in the
MP180 proteins range from 5% to 78%, with an average of 41%.
The beta sheet-rich proteins have a slightly higher average TM
composition (52%), in contrast to 42% for the helix-rich proteins
and 11% for the mixed alpha/beta proteins. The TM residue content
for the AMP dataset ranges from 2% to 79%, with an average of
31%. Again the beta sheet-rich ones have a slightly larger value
(37%) in comparison with the helix-rich (36%) and mixed alpha/beta
chains (10%).

3.3 Class and fold types

The CATH class distribution for the individual MP180 polypeptides
(67 chains with 85 domains) includes a larger number of mainly
alpha helical domains (Class 1) than mainly beta sheet domains
(Class 2) (Fig. 3a). However, there is a greater structural diversity
within Class 2 as it contains seven different CATH architectures
(Fig. 3b). The mixed 01/13 class (Class 3) is represented by ﬁve
architectures, whilst Class 4 with ‘few secondary structures’ is
represented by one architecture. Overall, the MP 1 80 dataset contains
four CATH classes and sixteen CATH architectures.

Similarly, Class 1 domains dominate the AMP dataset, with 170
examples. The Class 2 domains contain nine architectures, which
again reﬂect their larger structural diversity. Seven architecture types
are represented in Class 3 and a single architecture in Class 4. Of the
twenty one AMP architectures, sixteen are represented by the MP180
polypeptide chains, hence demonstrating a good representation of
CATH architectures by the MP180 dataset.

3.4 Analyses of validation and dataset predictive
abilities

The self-consistency of each dataset was assessed using ‘leave
one out’ cross-validation (Tables 1 and 2), where each spectrum
is removed in turn and analysed against the rest. Cross-validation
is one guide to the predictive accuracy of the dataset, which can be
evaluated by the r and 6 values obtained along with the g“ value.
This process was carried out with both the ‘principal’ (Table 1) and
‘alternate’ (Table 2) secondary structure Classiﬁcation schemes. For
the principal scheme, all datasets exhibited high correlations with

were too few examples of turns in this dataset to be meaningful for
self-validation), again with regular helices being the best deﬁned in
all datasets.

To test their predictive accuracies, the MP180 test set was tested
against the soluble protein-only dataset SP1751130 and the mixed
soluble/membrane protein dataset SMP180 (again with leaving out
the cognate proteins) with both Classiﬁcation schemes (Tables 3
and 4, lines 1 and 2). For the principal scheme (Table 3), all
values were better using SMP180, with only the 0 class below the
signiﬁcance cutoff level (4“ < 1.0) for this dataset.

More dramatic improvements were seen with the alternative
scheme (Table 4) generally used in CD analyses, with all secondary
structural types being much better predicted. Thus, it is clear that
SMP180 should be the preferred reference dataset for analyses of
membrane proteins. To then test the value of the mixed reference
dataset for the analysis of soluble proteins, similar predictive cross-
valuations were done for the soluble-only test system (SP1751130)
(Tables 3 and 4, line 3). SMP180 also produces excellent results
for all secondary structures in both schemes, with the beta sheet
structures in both being considerably better correlated than in the

SP1751130 self cross-correlation test. This then suggests the SMP180
reference dataset should also be the reference dataset of Choice
for soluble protein analyses, especially for determining beta sheet
contents.

The predictive performances of the SMP180 and SP1751130
datasets were then tested for their ability to separately identify the
secondary structural types in the trans-membrane and ecto-domains
of a protein (Table 5), a novel structural feature that has not been
previously possible to identify from membrane protein spectra. It
was expected that this type of analysis might be successful, because
of the different spectral Characteristics of residues present in the
aqueous and hydrophobic-exposed environments (Wallace et (11.,
2003). The SMP180 dataset produced very good predictions for both
helical and sheet types of transmembrane structures (Table 5, line 1),
although the extra-membranous fractions were not well-predicted.
As expected, the SP1751130 dataset did not allow identiﬁcation of
either the trans- or extra-membranous fractions (Table 5, line 2)
(indeed the blanks on the table arise because this dataset contains no
examples of transmembrane segments, which effectively results in a
divide by zero). The ability to separately detect the transmembrane
fractions corresponds with the observation (Supplementary Fig. S2)
that separate principal component analyses of the helix-rich proteins
in the MP180 and SP1751130 datasets indicate that all three peptide
backbone peaks (the n— > 71* and both 7':— > 71* transitions, located
at ~222, and 208 and 195 nm, respectively), are shifted by ~1 nm
with respect to each other in the membrane and soluble protein
spectra, consistent with previously seen solvent dielectric-related
shifts (Cascio and Wallace, 1995; Chen and Wallace, 1997). Thus,
the SMP180 reference dataset provides additional predictive power
for identifying the proportion of helical and sheet residues that are
found in transmembrane segments.

4 DISCUSSION

Accurate empirical analyses of membrane protein secondary
structures from CD spectra have been challenging until now due
to spectral differences between soluble and membrane proteins
(Park et (11., 1992; Wallace et (11., 2003). Although CD reference
datasets containing membrane proteins are available (Park et (11.,
1992; Sreerama et (11., 2004) the spectra were produced before
there were many high quality membrane protein structures in

Membrane protein dataset

 

the PDB and before there were good bioinformatics tools for
deﬁning fold space. Consequently they contain proteins of limited
structural diversity. Now that there are a relatively large number
of good-quality membrane protein crystal structures in the PDB,
we have been able to create a bioinformatics-deﬁned membrane
protein reference dataset covering a broad structural range for
the speciﬁc analyses of membrane protein spectra. The ability to
obtain high-quality spectral data using the SRCD spectroscopy
(higher signal-to-noise levels and lower wavelengths) contributed
to the improved spectral data that could be included. Furthermore,
for the accuracy and utility of the new reference dataset, it was
important to establish that the spectra were obtained on well- and
cross-calibrated instruments, that the magnitudes determined were
precisely correct (based on having accurate measurements of protein
concentration and cell pathlengths) and that the measurements were
done in conditions comparable to those used for the crystal structure
determinations. All spectra passed the Validichro validation tests
in the PCDDB (Whitmore et (11., 2011). For these reasons, the
spectra included in these datasets are considered ‘Gold standard’
and thus will be made publicly available separately via the PCDDB
(http://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk). It is expected that these spectra will
ﬁnd further use in the development of other methodologies, notably
machine learning algorithms (Andrade et (11., 1993) [which to date
have not had membrane protein spectra in their training sets, and
hence have not produced suitable results for membrane proteins
(Wallace et (11., 2003)] or for comparisons with ab initio calculations.
It is important to note that even though the data in this study were
collected by SRCD, they were cross-checked with CD spectroscopy
and all of the analyses employed 180 nm cutoff values, hence making
them suitable for use in analyses of conventional CD data.

The ability of the newly created membrane protein dataset,
MP 1 80, and especially of the larger combined soluble and membrane
protein dataset, SMP180, to accurately predict the secondary
structure contents of membrane proteins was compared with that
of a modiﬁed version of the best existing soluble-only protein
dataset, SP1751130 (Lees et (11., 2006a). Results from the analyses
of membrane protein spectra using the enlarged combined SMP180
dataset surpass the performance of both MP180 and SP1751130
datasets. This is likely to be because membrane proteins contain
both transmembrane and extra-membranous domains, which are
well-represented within the combined dataset.

The ability to differentiate between transmembrane and extra-
membranous secondary structures is a novel feature of the SMP180
dataset and is an important new capability for analysing membrane
proteins as it provides additional structural detail that will be useful
for molecular modeling of unknown structures (see the example
for a voltage-gated sodium channel, NaChBac, in the Supplemental
Material).

Thus signiﬁcant improvements have been achieved in membrane
protein CD analyses by incorporating membrane proteins and
soluble proteins into a single large CD reference dataset. The
increased number and diversity of proteins in SMP180 have also
resulted in improved analyses of soluble proteins, especially for the
sheet secondary structure components.

The observed suitability of the SMP180 dataset for analysing
membrane proteins may stem from the observed shifts, which
occur in spectral peak positions in membrane protein spectra in
comparison with those in soluble protein spectra with similar
secondary structure content, as well as other differences at the

supersecondary structure level. A likely source of the former spectral
differences is the different dielectric constants of the hydrophobic
environment surrounding membrane proteins and the aqueous
environment surrounding the soluble proteins.

In summary, the new datasets provide excellent results for both
soluble and membrane proteins in secondary structure analyses,
and in the transmembrane discrimination analyses of membrane
proteins, thereby providing novel information for the analysis and
molecular modeling of membrane proteins. Hence, they will be
included in the cadre of datasets available via the DichroWeb
analysis server (Whitmore and Wallace, 2008).

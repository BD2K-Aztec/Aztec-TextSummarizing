and junction spanning reads (at least one) as the cut-offs. Meanwhile, an in
silico sequence is generated using the consensus of reads within discordant
read clusters for each fusion candidate to help the PCR primer design, wltich
facilitates quick PCR validation.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To test the accuracy of VirusSeq, we analysed RNA-Seq data of 17
HCC cancers available in the TCGA database and detected HBV
transcripts in four cases (Table 1), two of which are from patients
with serologic evidence of HBV infection and one from a patient
who is seronegative for HBV (and hepatitis C virus). Serology data
were not available for the remaining case. Viral integration loci
identified in our analysis included known genes MLL4 (two cancers;
both from the two HBV-seropositive patients) and TERT, ITGAD,
TEADl, TECRL, Cl9orf55 and MIR548D2. Interestingly, the
cancer with TERT-associated HBV sequences came from the patient
who was reportedly seronegative for HBV. Our findings validate
other reports that have demonstrated HBV insertion in TERT and
MLL4 (Ferber et al., 2003, Saigo et 0]., 2008).

We also analysed RNA-Seq data of 239 cases of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) available in the TCGA database.
We detected human papillomavirus (HPV) transcripts in 37 cancers
as follows: 30 cancers with HPV16, ﬁve cancers with HPV33, one
cancer with HPV35 and one cancer with Epstein7Barr virus. In 24
cancers, HPV transcripts encoding for key viral proteins/oncopro-
teins (E7 in 22 cases; E6 in 20 cases; E1 in 17 cases and E4 in eight
cases) were integrated in the cancer genome, the majority in associ-
ation with known genes. We used the HPV16 status from colorimetric
in situ hybridization and the p16 immunohistochemistry data (clinical
data) to estimate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity for HPV16 detection.
We found that a total of eight samples were HPV16-positive from
colorimetric in situ hybridization (six HPV16-positive) and/or p16
immunohistochemistry (seven HPV16-positive), and 36 samples
were HPV16-negative. The HPV16 status was not available for all
the remaining samples. The conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were estimated
using the Wilson score method by taking the sample size into con-
sideration. For this HNSCC dataset, the sensitivity was 100% (8/8)
with a 95% CI of 67.671000/0, and specificity was 100% (36/36) with
a 95% CI of 90.471000/0 (Table 2).

We have developed a new algorithmic method called VirusSeq for
detecting the known viruses and their integration sites in the human
genome using NGS data. We evaluated VirusSeq on RNA-Seq data
of 17 HCC and 239 HNSCC samples and showed that VirusSeq
accurately detects the known viruses and their integration sites.
VirusSeq can also perform this function using whole-genome sequen-
cing data obtained from human tissue. The main limitation of
VirusSeq is the requirement of the known virus database to nominate
candidate viruses in human cancer tissue. This will certainly miss
novel viruses that are not in the virus database. We expect
VirusSeq to be an effective solution for detecting viruses and their
integration sites in cancer studies. We invite users to test our software.

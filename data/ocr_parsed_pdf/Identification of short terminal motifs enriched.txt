ABSTRACT

Motivation: Mass spectrometry-based protein profiling has become a
key technology in biomedical research and biomarker discovery.
Sample preparation strategies that reduce the complexity of tryptic
digests by immunoaffinity substantially increase throughput and
sensitivity in proteomic mass spectrometry. The scarce availability of
peptide-specific capture antibodies limits these approaches. Recently
antibodies directed against short terminal motifs were found to enrich
subsets of peptides with identical terminal sequences. This approach
holds the promise of a significant gain in efficiency. TXP (Triple X
Proteomics) and context-independent motif specific/global proteome
survey binders are variants of this concept. Principally the binding
motifs of such antibodies have to be elucidated after generating
these antibodies. This entails a substantial effort in the lab, as it
requires synthetic peptide libraries and numerous mass spectrometry
experiments.

Results: We present an algorithm for predicting the antibody-binding
motif in a mass spectrum obtained from a tryptic digest of a common
cell line after immunoprecipitation. The epitope prediction, based
on peptide mass fingerprinting, reveals the most enriched terminal
epitopes. The tool provides a P—value for each potential epitope,
estimated by sampling random spectra from a peptide database.
The second algorithm combines the predicted sequences to more
complex binding motifs. A comparison with library screenings shows
that the predictions made by the novel methods are reliable and
reproducible indicators of the binding properties of an antibody.

sensus peptide databases and the applied protocols are available

1 INTRODUCTION

Immunoafﬁnity enrichment, combined with mass spectrometry,
increases sample throughput and sensitivity in proteomic
research (Anderson et al., 2004). However, the generation and
detailed characterization of appropriate capture reagents act as a
bottleneck and involve substantial lab resources. This has led
various groups to develop techniques enabling the enrichment
of multiple targets using generic binders. Rush et a]. (2005)
showed that an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine can
enrich tyrosin-phosphorylated proteins. The Triple X Proteomics
(TXP) technique (Poetz et al., 2009) and the Global Proteome
Survey (GPS) methodology have extended this concept and are
rational approaches aimed to achieving motif-speciﬁc peptide
enrichment. In the TXP approach, antibodies bind to short
linear epitopes present in multiple peptides of complex samples
after protein fragmentation by trypsin (see Fig. 1). In silica
selection of antigens reduces to minimum the set of TXP anti-
bodies required to cover a pre-deﬁned protein target list
(Planatscher et al., 2010).

Search space restriction gained from the revealed binding epi-
tope could improve protein identiﬁcation from MS and MSMS
data. However the enrichment of proteotypic peptides with TXP
antibodies leads to new challenges in the analysis of mass spec-
trometric datasets. Results from immunoafﬁnity experiments
using TXP-antibodies revealed the enrichment of peptides con-
taining the targeted epitope. Some identiﬁed peptides also
matched sequence variants (Hoeppe et al., 2011). In that study
it came clear that the terms ‘speciﬁc’ and ‘unspeciﬁc’ must be con-
sidered inappropriate in charcterizing these binders. ‘Speciﬁcity’
generally refers to binding of one protein or peptide to an anti-
body. Other binding events are deemed to be unspeciﬁc, off-
target or cross-reactive. In the TXP strategy, the binding of the
antibody towards multiple peptides is inherent. Therefore, novel
concepts for epitope identiﬁcation are needed, which would
enable properties of the antibody-binding domain to be distin-
guished from interactions occurring elsewhere.

There are three main reasons why unexpected peptides can be
detected in the immunoprecipitates. First, this could be due to
epitope variations in the polyclonal antibody. Second, off-target
binding can occur due to sequence similarity, and unlike the
immunized antigen, this involves the apparent epitope or binding
motif of the antibody mixture. Third, carry-over peptides may
remain detectable in the sample, solely due to their persisting
massive presence, despite multiple washing steps and meticulous

care on the part of the lab operator. While carry-over is merely
noise, it is worth quantifying the variation caused by polyclon-
ality and the apparent epitope.

Using recombinant motif-speciﬁc antibodies (GPS/context—
independent motif speciﬁc-binders) which also enrich classes of
peptides (Olsson et al., 2012a) observed that these binders were
markedly promiscuous. They compared sequence data obtained
from tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-LTQ Orbitrap) with
structural information. Their ﬁndings showed that the antibodies
not only captured peptides containing the targeted epitope but
also variations of it. Thus, the enriched peptides revealed binding
motifs. Different amino acid side chains are known to interact
with the antibody-binding site at individual positions. However
such in-depth characterizations of epitope motifs analysis call for
extensive experiments.

A common approach to elucidate a detailed linear epitope is to
conduct an interaction analysis between an antibody and peptide
libraries. These libraries comprise synthetic peptides which have
at least one modiﬁed position (Houghten et al., 1991). For in-
stance, if an antibody is raised against the C—terminal sequence
LGYR, the peptide library for an epitope would consist of
XGYR, LXYR, LGXR and LGYX-peptides, with the X repre-
senting all 20 amino acids. Instead of adding a single amino acid
at step It, all 20 are added in equal amounts. This leads to a
library of 80 different peptides for a four-amino-acid epitope.
The synthesis and subsequent measurement of these peptides
are signiﬁcant cost drivers in this phase of antibody develop-
ment. Moreover, the quality control for such a binder would
be more expensive than its generation. Our study aimed at devis-
ing a simpler, cost-effective method entailing less effort than that
required in the labour-intensive peptide-library approach. We
present an algorithm for calculating the detailed epitope using
MS data from an immunoafﬁnity-MS experiment.

Peptide mass ﬁngerprinting is a well-established method in
proteomics ﬂ-Ienzel et al., 1993; James et al., 1993; Mann et al.,
1993; Pappin et al., 1993; Yates et al., 1993), on which we based
the TXP-TEA (Terminal sequence Enrichment Analysis) algo-
rithm. The original technique involves identifying an isolated
and subsequently digested protein by the characteristic pattern

in the peptide mass spectrum. TXP-TEA performs searches for
patterns related to sets of peptides sharing a speciﬁc terminal
amino acid sequence, instead of spectral patterns associated
with a speciﬁc protein. The method compares the masses
observed in the measurement with a theoretical spectrum from
a database. The MATERICS algorithm we describe here merges
the results of TXP-TEA to the antibody binding motif.

2 MS TERMINAL SEQUENCE ENRICHMENT

When an antibody enriches peptides with a common sequence,
it can be anticipated that the mass spectrometer will detect
more matching signals. The TXP-TEA algorithm scores sig-
nals from an observed peak list, based on a scoring table
which indicates the probability of observing the same signal in
a random peak under the same conditions. The less likely such a
signal is, the more probable it is that the observed peak list is not
random. The software reports every sequence and score that is
found.

A peak list is a set of mass-to-charge/intensity pairs
(mzl, i1), .., (mzn, in), obtained from a mass spectrum by further
signal processing (noise ﬁltering, peak-picking, normalization,
etc.). The dominant ion species produced in MALDI mass spec-
trometry has the charge +1[M + H]+. The mZ-Values are 
and thus equal in value, but not in dimension, to the molecule
plus a proton mass. By subtracting the proton mass
m,- 2 m2,- — M H, the mz-Values mzl, ...,mz,, are transformed
into mass values m1, ...,m,,.

The sequence database contains information about peptides
that can be expected in samples of a given species. Protein se-
quence databases, such as Uniprot (Wu et al., 2006) and proteo-
typic peptides databases such as the Global Proteome Machine
(Fenyo et al., 2010) or the Peptide Atlas (Deutsch et al., 2008)
are well-established data repositories. Proteotypic peptide data-
bases are particularly valuable because each sequence had al-
ready been observed in mass spectrometry-based experiments.
In our algorithm, a database D is a set of peptide sequences
{[71, - - - 21)]

Using database D, TXP-TEA ﬁrst makes a comprehensive list
of peptides with theoretical masses, whose observed mass in M obs
matches a mass in the peak list by a predeﬁned error threshold.
Common MALDI mass spectrometers operate at a medium
resolution and mass errors below 30 parts per million are
normal. Due to the limited resolution and isobaric peptides,
each signal in a spectrum can originate from different peptides.
The set of selected peptides in range is:

Mo — M.
S(D,Mobs,ewl) = {pii%106i 5 an} (1)
Pi
The result is a set of peptides
DM = U S(D, Mobs, en) (2)
MobsEM

and ﬁnally a list of possible epitope candidates is generated. Each
candidate epitope can explain signals in the spectrum, provided
that the peptides matching that speciﬁc terminal sequence have
been enriched. The number of matching peptides found in the

full database search is also relevant, because it deﬁnes the back-
ground probability.

For example, if ﬁve masses in a 73-peak spectrum match pep-
tides sharing the c-terminal sequence LGYR and 65 peptides in
the full database terminate in LGYR, this event must be rated by
estimating the probability of finding ﬁve (or more) out of 65 (or
less) peptides which share the same C-terminal sequence of
length 4 in a random 73-peak spectrum.

We deﬁne an enrichment event E¢(i, j) as: i matching signals
out of j masses from the same epitope class, by applying the
parameters d3 = (D, 5101, t, I, k) in a peak list of k masses. TXP-
TEA estimates the likelihood of such enrichment events by sam-
pling from random spectra. The parameters d3 of the sampling
are: the terminus (C— or N—terminal) t, sequence length 1, number
of peaks k, mass error tolerance 6101 and peptide database D. The
number of masses in the peak list k is also a sampling parameter.
Each setting of these parameters requires a dedicated sampling
table. Sampling generates many random peak lists by randomly
selecting theoretical masses from the peptide database.

The random peak lists are then processed as described above.
Algorithm 1 counts the number of repeated enrichment events
and generates a sampling table. A sampling table is a n xm-
matrix Sq). Here m is the size of the largest epitope class in the
database and n is the largest number of peaks attributable to one
epitope-class, observed in a random spectrum, during the sam-
pling process. S¢(i,J) is the frequency of the event that i of j
expected masses match, depending on the parameters d3.

Table 1 is the result of a sampling run of 25 000 iterations for
mass spectra of 100 peaks and a mass tolerance of 30 ppm in a

consensus data peptide database (d3 = (ConsensusDB, 6101 =
30, t = C,I= 4,k = 100)). The event of observing four out of
17 peptides with a common terminus occurred 127 times in
25 000 random spectra. The sampling table is not a perfect
lower triangular matrix because of the occurrence of overlapping
peaks. If the mass of a peptide with a unique terminal sequence is
in within close range of two masses in a random spectrum, the
event-counter for E¢(2, 1) increases (i.e. observed 18 373 times in
sampling Table 1).

It is better to use standard settings to limit the available
choices relating to the assumed error tolerance, background
database, terminus and sequence length. This limits the compu-
tational effort to a required minimum.

However the parameter k, number of peaks, varies from spec-
trum to spectrum. The sampling Algorithm 1 solves this difﬁ-
culty by incrementally updating the sampling table. It creates the
sampling table for 73-peak spectra by adding a random peak to
all 72—peak spectra, from the 72-peak sampling table in the pre-
vious step. This is considerably faster than analyzing 73 peaks
from scratch.

TXP-TEA estimates the P—Value 13(E¢(i, 1)) by dividing the
count of the same and more extreme events by the total
number of events:

ﬂEoUJ» = m-
k 1

(3)

The P—Value is the probability of observing a speciﬁc or more
extreme event, given that the null hypothesis is true. If a
rare event occurs, the estimated P-Value is sufﬁciently small.
The null hypothesis (Pharoah, 2007) can be rejected, because
observing such data under this assumption is improbable. The
null hypothesis in TXP-TEA is: ‘The binder does not enrich any
single terminal sequence in the sample.’ A simple alternative hy-
pothesis is: ‘The binder enriches the terminal epitope LGYR in
the sample.’

Figure 2 Visualizes P—Values obtained from sampling tables
generated by 25 000 random spectra from a background peptide
database for Homo sapiens (merged GPM, PeptideAtlas, in silico
tryptic digest Uniprot).

Mass accuracy and the number of peaks determine the number
of different candidate epitopes to be analyzed by TXP-TEA in a
search. Each candidate represents an alternative hypothesis.
As these represent different hypotheses, it is important to correct
for multiple testing. By assuming a signiﬁcant level of or = 0.05
and 3000 different epitopes in a single search. By chance
3000 x 0.05 = 150 epitopes will have a signiﬁcant P—Value,
provided that the P—Values follow a uniform distribution.
Bonferroni correction adapts the significance level to a’ = %,
dividing by the number of candidate sequence. Finally
TXP-TEA reports enrichment of a terminal epitope sequence if

3 FROM SEQUENCES TO COMPLEX EPITOPES

MS/MS experiments revealed that the enriched epitopes are
more complex than the immunization antigen sequence. The
antibody binds to variations of a main sequence, therefore with
less afﬁnity (Olsson et al., 2012a, b). Variation often occurs
mainly in one or two positions, while the other positions
remain constant. These ﬁndings form the central idea of the
MATERICS (mass-spectrometric analysis of terminal epitope
enrichment in complex samples) algorithm, a novel approach
to ascertain the motif rapidly and automatically.

Residue variation at key positions is a well-known concept
which is applied by computational immunologists to MHC mol-
ecules, cell surface proteins similar to antibodies. The binding
speciﬁcity of MHC-molecules is often characterized by peptide
motifs (Falk and Rdtzschke, 1993; Stern, 2007). A MHC class I
peptide motif deﬁnes one or two internal anchor positions and
an additional ﬁxed position at the C—terminus. Each MHC allele
has a characteristic motif (Sherman, 2006).

Wildcards such as LG[AYL]R describe such sequence motifs.
This expression matches LGAR, LGYR and LGLR. This form
gives no information about which of the three different amino
acids is more probable at the variable position. Another common
way to define a peptide motif is to use a position weight matrix

average number of events which occurred during sampling: 50 peaks/
50 ppm 4966 events, 50 peaks/ 10 ppm 1452 events. If mass accuracy is
high, the number of peptides matching a mass will reduce. This also
reduces matches of peptides with the same epitope to different peaks in
the spectrum. This explains why higher mass accuracy allows TXP-TEA
to detect signiﬁcant enrichment events with low numbers of matching
masses

(PWM). These matrices assign a probability pi]- to each amino
acid A,- for a speciﬁc sequence position sj in a sequence s.

Each motif represents a trade-off between sensitivity, speciﬁ-
city and model complexity. A PWM, which assigns equal prob-
ability to all amino acids at all positions, obviously matches all
peaks in the observed set. Such a motif lacks any useful infor-
mation, whereas a motif which assigns a probability of 1.0 to one
speciﬁc amino acid at every position as well as matches a peptide
for all peaks in the spectrum is a remarkable ﬁnding.

Identification of short terminal motifs

 

Information content, derived from Shannon Entropy, is a
complexity measure for PWMs (Lund et al., 2005). H(X) denotes
a measure of uncertainty

H(X) = 210061) -10g(l7(x,-)) (4)
j

to a discrete random variable X with n different outcomes. H(X)
is minimal if all events are equally probable and the uncertainty
is thus maximal. If one event occurs, the uncertainty is minimal,
and the entropy term will maximize and be equal to 0. The com-
plexity measure for a PWM P

L N
ICrP) = —ZZPtj'10g(Pr/') (5)
i 1'

follows, by applying the entropy score to each position and cal-
culating the sum.
The space of possible PWM epitopes is

E: {x e [ng,]|zx, = 1.011}. (6)

While that set is not countable, the set of wildcards W = 73(A)l
is enumerable. A denominates the set of amino acids. With
|P(A)| = 220 = 1.048.576 the number of possible wildcards of
length 4 is 1.048.5764 B 1209 x 1024. MATERICS can appropri-
ately limit a search from start, or abort it in a timely manner
during the process.

In the first step of MATERICS, TXP-TEA generates the rank-
ing of enriched sequences. MATERICS scores all motifs with
one unspeciﬁc position (?XXX,X?XX,XX?X,XXX?) by combin-
ing the P—Values of all the matching terminal sequences using
Fisher’s Method. This method is applied in meta-analysis statis-
tics to accumulate evidence from different studies. The sum ,0 of
logarithms of P—Values

which gives the combined P-Value. y(k, p) is the lower incomplete
gamma function. The list L will include epitopes for further pro-
cessing, if the combined P—Values<0.1, divided by the total
number of motifs scored. This step removes candidate epitopes
from the search which, even in the context of similar epitopes,
will not contribute to a relevant motif.

In the next step, MATERICS combines sequences using re-
cursive enumeration (see Fig. 3) and calculates the complexity of
each motif. The recursion stops if complexity exceeds a certain
limit. During recursion, the method updates the coverage score
using Fisher’s Method. The recursive loop calculates the sum of
logarithms incrementally.

MATERICS uses a suitable property of Fisher’s method as a
recursion bound. Assuming the method is applied to a vector of
sorted P—Values

(171,122, ---,pj, ...,pn)

and that the combined P-Value pvalc(pj,y) increases
pvalcm-ir, (1' — 1)) S Waldo-,1)

at one point, it follows that by adding further tests (with
P—Values >pj) there will be no improvement in the combined
P—Value. This means that pvalc has a well-defined global opti-
mum. The algorithm can terminate recursion once the combined
P—Value starts to increase. Other termination criteria include a
complexity measure exceeding a predefined limit and sequence
P—Values >0.05. These bounds ensure reasonably fast processing.
A motif prediction takes from few seconds up to a minute on a
single AMD Phenom X6 core clocked at 3.3 Ghz.

The algorithm will include a motif in the solution set M ifi
and only ifino motif with lower complexity and a higher score
was found. It reports motifs representing good compromises of
complexity and P—Value in the ﬁnal output. This concept is
known as Pareto optimality in the field of multi-objective opti-
mization. A motif M1 with a complexity score IC(M1) and a
P—Value pval(M1) will dominate a second motif Mziif and
only ifiIC(M1)>IC(M2) and pval(M1)<pval(M2). It reflects
the process of model building by the expert, which also weighs
model complexity, against how much the model can explain.

The user interface presents each solution in M, enabling
the user to make an informed judgement. Whereas during

the suitability of a classiﬁcation model by the number of true

for robustness. This convention for model fitness evaluation was

applied to PWM models for TXP-epitopes enrichment in mass
spectra:

The number of true negatives (absence predicted, not
observed) is estimated by the number of distinguishable peaks
in the range from 80(L2500 Da and the speciﬁed error tolerance.

Our work compares the novel algorithms to peptide libraries
for motif elucidation. Experiments included measurements
before and after immunoprecipitation (IP) took place. The dif-
ference between measured signal intensities is the effect of the
antibody speciﬁcity at the given position.

The pre-IP measurements account for sequence-speciﬁc ion-
ization characteristics in the mass spectrometer as well as differ-
ences in the outcome of the peptide synthesis. The signal
intensities were used to normalize the data from the post-IP
experiment. The normalization coefficient for a speciﬁc peptide
found in the library is:

A(ma)
1%) — 2 Am) WI (11)

beD
where m, is the known mass of the library peptide with amino
acid a at a variable position, A(ma) the peak area at the respect-
ive position, and D the set of peptides found in the library. This
‘flight factor’ reﬂects the ionization properties: thus even if all the
synthetic peptides are equally abundant in the library, the mea-
sured signal intensities will differ by orders of magnitude. Peptide
prevalence P(A) can be calculated by using F(A) and the post-IP
data

A(Ma)F(a)

P(a) = W. (12)

For amino acid exchanges which are not distinguishable by the
resolution of the mass spectrometer, the probability is shared in
the inferred motif. Therefore leucine and isoleucine will always
appear as equally probable in motifs constructed by the peptide
library approach. MATERICS is able to discriminate isobaric
exchanges, because predictions are based on sequence database.
For example if MATERICS detects only enriched peptide se-
quences with leucine, but none with isoleucine at the respective
position, this will be reﬂected in the motif.

4 EXPERIMENTS

Three different antibodies generated against the 4-mer peptides
AMTR, LGYR and EIER were analyzed using the MATERICS
workﬂow. Four peptide libraries (Intavis) per binder were used,
one for each amino acid position. The immunoprecipitation
was performed automatically in 96-well Robotic PCR Plates
(AB-1300, Thermo Scientiﬁc) using a KingFisher 96 Magnetic
Particle Processor (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Of each peptide, 10-pmol
library was incubated with 1 0g antibody for 1 h in 100 01 phos-
phate buffered saline+0.3% n—Octyl-ﬂ-D-glucopyranoside
(PBSN). The antibodyipeptide complexes were precipitated for
1h by incubation with 501 protein G-coated magnetic beads
(20% w/V slurry, Dynabeads, Thermo Scientiﬁc). Five washing
steps then followed, by transferring the beads two times
into 100 01 PBSN and three times into 10001 50mM ammo-
nium hydrogen carbonate (pH 7.4)+0.3% n—Octyl-ﬂ-
D-glucopyranoside. Finally, the peptides were eluted by
transferring them to 20 01 1% formic acid. Eight-fold spotting
of a 1-01 eluate was deposited onto a MALDI target (Prespotted
AnchorChip, PAC II 384, Bruker Daltonics). The spots were
washed with cold 10mM ammonium phosphate + 0.1% triﬂuor-
oacetic acid in a beaker glass prior to MS analysis.

In a second experiment cultured HEK293, HELA and A751
cells were lysed at 80% conﬂuence with lysis buffer containing
0.50% triton, 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.15M NaCl,
0.01M NaH2PO4, 2mM EDTA, and 1x protease inhibitor
(cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche) (pH
7.2). For tryptic digestion, 1000 0g protein extract (20g/0l)
was reduced by adding 501 0.5M dithiothreitol to reach a
final concentration of 5mM. The samples were incubated
for 60min at 600C and 650 rpm in an orbital shaker
(Thermomixer, Eppendorf). They were then cooled down and
alkylated by adding 25 01 0.2M iodacetamide and incubated at
250C in the dark for 30 min. After the alkylation process, the
sample was diluted 1:2 with 50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)amino-
methane and 1mM CaC12 (pH 8.5). Trypsin (Trypsin Gold,
Promega) was added in an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:40.
The digestion was performed for 16h at 370C. Trypsin was
heat-inactivated at 1000C for 5min. Additionally, 5.8 01 phenyl-
methanesulfonyl ﬂuoride in methanol (200 mM, Sigma-Aldrich)
was added. Finally, the samples were centrifuged at 13 000 rpm
for 5min. In the immunoprecipitation step, 50 0g digested pro-
tein extract per cell line was applied. In our study, we used 5 0g
antibody and, accordingly, 25 01 protein G-coated magnetic
beads. Immunoprecipitations were carried out thrice per cell line.

The spots were analyzed using an Ultraﬂex III MALDI-TOF/
TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in positive ion
reﬂectron mode. The deﬂector cutoff was set up to 500 Da.

Mass calibration was performed by using pre—spotted calibrants
on PAC II 384 plates. The detection mass range was set from 600
to 4000 Da. The laser power was adjusted manually. The signal
intensities of 2000 shots were accumulated per spot. Peaks were
annotated automatically with a signal-to-noise threshold of 3
and a mass range from 750 to 4000 Da using ﬂexAnalysis 3.0
software (Bruker Daltonics).

Each replicate was analyzed with MATERICS by means of a
uniﬁed peptide database containing the peptide sequences from
GPM (Beavis, 2006), PeptideAtlas (Deutsch et al., 2008), and
peptide identification from the Human Plasma Proteome
Project (Omenn et al., 2006), with 30-ppm error tolerance, and
maximum complexity 2.0.

In addition benchmark experiments were performed using arti-
ﬁcial data to test the inﬂuence of noise on the performance of
MATERICS. Methodology and results are discussed in depth in
the Supplementary Material.

5 RESULTS

Table 2 summarizes the results for the positional peptide library
experiments as well as those for the MATERICS algorithm in the
cell line experiments. The library results for the ‘AMTR’ antibody
indicate minor variation at the ﬁrst and third positions and high
variation at the second position. MATERICS predictions de-
tected a high degree of variation at the second position. For the
‘LGYR’-antibody, the library experiments revealed low vari-
ations at the ﬁrst, third and fourth positions and high variations
at the second position. Since isoleucine (I) and leucine (L) are

isobaric and therefore indistinguishable by mass spectrometry,
the library method assigns equal probability to both amino
acids at the ﬁrst position. MATERICS predictions suggest a vari-
ation at the second position in the enriched peptide samples pre-
cipitated from the digested HELA and A397 cell line. Our results
do not indicate that isoleucine is bound at the ﬁrst position, the
prediction only showed leucine. When applied to HEK293 immu-
noprecipitate mass spectra, the algorithm suggests an alternative
binding of valin (V) at the ﬁrst position. The ‘EIER’ antibody
showed a high preferential binding to its antigen sequence.
Sequences which vary at the ﬁrst and third position have low
binding afﬁnity. The prediction conﬁrmed the low variability at
the ﬁrst position in the HELA and A397 immunoprecipitate.
MATERICS detected sequence variability at the second position
in all samples. It also predicted equal probabilities to leucine and
isoleucine, and detected binding to methionine at the second pos-
ition in the HEK293 and A397 cell line. The algorithm predicted
variability at the third position of the motif in the HELA sample.

ferent immunoprecipitates and technical replicates of the same
sample.

solutions measured by MCC. Note that the solutions ranked
lower by their P-Value can have better MCC scores (see

motifs identiﬁed by the positional peptide-library experiments in

different cell lines for the three antibodies. However the compari-
son also revealed some discrepancies between the control experi-
ment and the MATERICS results. The motif for the anti-AMTR
antibody found by the library experiment is more complex than
the motifs predicted by MATERICS. This could be a conse-
quence of complexity restrictions by the algorithm. The complex-
ity-scoring function penalizes an additional amino acid at the
ﬁrst position ([AS]?TR instead of A?TR) in terms of the degree
of variability at the second position. The motif exceeds the com-
plexity bound and is therefore not considered.

The binding property of the anti-EIER antibody was the most
difﬁcult to predict. MATERICS did not detect a signiﬁcant
enrichment in the pre-selection step for most spectra. Instead
of predicting a wrong motif, it did not make any prediction at
all and, instead, reported that no significant enrichment was de-
tectable. If the input data passed the pre-selection step, the
predicted motifs were observable close to the results of the pep-
tide libraries. On only one occasion did MATERICS (see
Supplementary Material, anti-AMTR, A357, biological replicate
2, technical replicate 2) make a wrong prediction: a comparison
to the other technical replicates of the same immunoprecipitation
ruled out this result. As shown in Table 4, experiments for the
anti-EIER antibody resulted in bad quality spectra for the HEK
cell lysate, whereas immunoprecitipations from HELA- and
A357-digests enabled motif prediction in many technical repli-
cates. On the whole, the HELA digest appears to be the most
stable ‘standard’ sample for motif prediction pertaining to the
three observed binders.

Although the results are obviously dependent on the observed
epitope, it must be noted that using HELA cell lysate does not
always produce the best prediction results. Some terminal epi-
topes are more abundant in some cell lines than others. Reports
concluded that each cell line leads to the best MCC score for a
given binder (results marked bold in Table 4). There was ad-
equate reproducibility within different immunoprecipitates and
the technical replicates, at least for the stronger binders. The
results obtained from different cell lines show a reasonable
level of agreement. Apart from the minor variation described,

this novel approach appears to work independently of the chosen
line. This strengthens ﬂexibility as cell lines in stock at the lab can
be used to perform MATERICS experiments.

Benchmark experiments using artiﬁcial data showed, that
MATERICS can make reliable predictions even if only a
minor fraction of the signals found in a peak list is related to
the enriched epitope (see Supplementary Material).

7 CONCLUSION

Our experimental study shows that TXP-TEA and MATERICS
are able to identify terminal binding motifs in immunoafﬁnity
MS experiments. The motifs obtained closely resemble patterns
found by using a peptide library approach. The described meth-
ods for motif elucidation lead to a substantial reduction in costs.
In addition the novel method enables the weighting of isobaric
variations in the binding motifs. These techniques might well
lead to improved peptide-identification algorithms, which exploit
the existing data on potentially enriched sequences during the
search process. Our ﬁndings are relevant to other fields of bio-
medical research, such as in the identification of the binding
properties of MHC molecules. Future versions of the algorithms
will include options to identify internal epitopes and binding
motifs as well as new ways to deal with post-translational
modiﬁcations.

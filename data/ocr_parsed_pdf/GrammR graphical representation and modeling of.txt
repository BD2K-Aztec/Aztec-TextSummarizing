Abstract

Motivation: Microbiota compositions have great implications in human health, such as obesity
and other conditions. As such, it is of great importance to cluster samples or taxa to visualize and
discover community substructures. Graphical representation of metagenomic count data relies on
two aspects, measure of dissimilarity between samples/taxa and algorithm used to estimate coord—
inates to study microbiota communities. UniFrac is a dissimilarity measure commonly used in
metagenomic research, but it requires a phylogenetic tree. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) is
a popular algorithm for estimating two—dimensional (2D) coordinates for graphical representation,
although alternative and higher—dimensional representations may reveal underlying community
substructures invisible in 2D representations.

Results: We adapt a new measure of dissimilarity, penalized Kendall’s r—distance, which does not
depend on a phylogenetic tree, and hence more readily applicable to a wider class of problems.
Further, we propose to use metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) as an alternative to PCoA for
graphical representation. We then devise a novel procedure for determining the number of clusters
in conjunction with PAM (mPAM). We show superior performances with higher—dimensional repre—
sentations. We further demonstrate the utility of mPAM for accurate clustering analysis, especially
with higher—dimensional MDS models. Applications to two human microbiota datasets illustrate
greater insights into the subcommunity structure with a higher—dimensional analysis.

1 Introduction

 

The underlying subcommunity structure of data provides vital infor—
mation about the diversity of microbial composition within the com—
munities. It is well established that human microbiota samples
collected from different body habitats show differences in bacterial
composition (Costello et (11., 2009; Turnbaugh, 2009). Microbiota in
the same body habitat (say gut) may also vary wildly within and
across populations, which may have great implications in human

health, such as on obesity and other conditions (Ridaura et (11., 2013;
Subramanian et (11., 2014; Yatsunenko et (11., 2012). As such, it is of
great importance to cluster samples or taxa to visualize and discover
community substructures. Assigning the recorded gene sequences into
different taxonomic ranks yields a matrix consisting of non—negative
integer values, typically known as the metagenomic count matrix.
Given a measure of distance between samples (e.g. dissimilarity
between counts in different rows; see below), principal coordinate

analysis (PCoA) is a standard technique to place the samples on an
Euclidean coordinate space. The aim is to represent the samples as
points in a coordinate space so that under a specified metric, the dis—
tance between any two points is representative of the dissimilarity
between the samples which they represent. The amount of informa—
tion in the dissimilarity that is conveyed by PCoA is through the
principal components (PCs), which increases as the dimension of the
coordinate space (number of PCs) increases. However, in practice,
a vast majority of researches construct only two—dimensional (2D)
PCoA models for ease of presentation (Costello et (11., 2009; Holmes
et (11., 2012; Ley et (11., 2008; Lozupone and Knight, 2007).

In several studies that used PCoA models, the amount of vari—
ance explained by the first two (PCs) is very small and does not
exceed 30% (Costello et (11., 2009; Lozupone and Knight, 2007).
This is because the dimension of the distance matrix is equal to the
sample size, which is typical high, and thus it is very unlikely that
two or three directions can explain a huge proportion of the vari—
ability. An alternative to PCoA is metric multidimensional scaling
(MDS), which is modeled by optimizing the difference between true
dissimilarity and distance between estimated coordinates, where the
distance estimate is determined by the metric specified. In fact, when
the metric is Euclidean, metric MDS is equivalent to PCoA, thus
metric MDS is a general class of dimension reduction models that
includes PCoA as a special case. For different metrics, the shape
of representation of the data is different. For example, in two dimen—
sions, the shape of the PCoA model is a circle while that of the
11—metric based MDS model is a square. Studying graphical represen—
tation of the samples under different norms might reveal features in
the data that are not detected by PCoA.

An important aspect that drives PCoA representation of the data
is the measure of dissimilarity between samples. A popular measure
of dissimilarity used in the metagenomic research community is
UniFrac distance (Lozupone and Knight, 2005), which is calculated
by placing the samples on a phylogenetic tree and counting the num—
ber of unshared branches between the two samples. Calculation of
UniFrac distance requires the phylogenetic information in addition
to the taxonomic count matrix. As such, UniFrac is the measure of
choice in studies where the 16S rRNA gene sequences are recorded
because the phylogenetic tree, an important feature of the 16S data,
can reveal relevant biological signals when used appropriately.
This approach, however, is not practicable for studies in which the
phylogenetic tree is not readily available, such as in shotgun
sequencing, where one can only construct Operational Taxonomic
Units (OTUs) that best represent the samples, for example, through
matching the shotgun sequences to a reference database. This calls
for the development of a dissimilarity measure that can be used in
the absence of a phylogenetic tree.

Since the data matrix comprises integer—valued counts with some
extreme values, regular lp—norms may not be appropriate. As an
alternative, we propose to use Kendall’s r—distance as the measure of
dissimilarity. While r—distance is originally proposed to compare
two sets of rankings, it can be easily extended to counts. Properties
of the Kendall’s r—distance are studied extensively and can be penal—
ized to be applicable even when there are ties (Fagin et (11., 2004).
Depending on the penalty imposed, the Kendall’s distance may also
be a metric. Hence, metric MDS models can be constructed without
compromising the information.

Although, MDS models are used mainly for graphical represen—
tation of data, they can also be used to study clustering. Given the
true community membership of samples, it is of interest to see if the
graphical models can visually separate the clusters. For example, in
the metagenomic count data described in Costello et al. (2009),

body habitats from which the samples are collected can be used to
aid visualization of the aptness of the estimated clusters. For the gut
microbiome data of obese twins (Holmes et (11., 2012; Turnbaugh,
2009), as another example, attributes of the individuals such as eth—
nicity, zygosity and obesity can be used to cluster samples to visually
correlate with estimated clusters based on metagenomic count data.
An interesting question that arises is to see how accurately clustering
techniques such as partitioning around medoids (PAM) perform as
a follow—up step after metric MDS modeling.

When clustering using PAM, the optimal number of clusters
is determined using the average silhouette width. Standard practice is to
use the number of clusters that results in maximum silhouette width
(Rousseeuw, 1987). This, however, can result in introduction of unin—
formative clusters with minute increase in the silhouette width. As an
illustration, consider Supplementary Figure S1 which shows the sil—
houette width plot constructed for a dataset, whose generating model
was constructed based on the Costello data as detailed in Section 3.
The graph shows that maximum silhouette width is not the best repre—
sentative of the optimal number of clusters for this dataset. For ex—
ample, consider the 4D l1—MDS model in the graph. The maximum
silhouette width (0.8709) is obtained at 18 clusters. However, the
model attains a width of 0.8206 for 10 clusters (the last big jump be—
fore the increases become incremental), gaining only 5.02% in width
while creating 8 additional clusters. Similar phenomenon is observed
for all the PCoA models.

In this article, we propose to use the Kendall’s r—distance as a meas—
ure of dissimilarity for metagenomic count data when a phylogenetic
tree is not readily available. We then construct metric MDS models
for varying dimensions (focusing on dimensions 2—4 for feasibility of
visualization) to study their aptness for representing metagenomic
community substructures. A modified silhouette width plot in con—
junction with PAM, mPAM, is proposed as a novel measure for deter—
mining the number of clusters that discounts incremental increases.
These results are compared with their counterparts based on the
PCoA models. We would like to emphasize that the primary aim of
this article is not to determine which of these methods is the best un—
equivocally, but to carry out a comparison between them to make in—
formed recommendations. As an illustration to demonstrate the
methods, especially the outcomes when a higher dimension is used,
we applied the methods to analyzing two datasets.

2 Methods

2.1 Metagenomic count matrix

For a dataset with 71 samples, let X : [Xiijl Signal SigK denote
the metagenomic count matrix with K ‘effective’ OTUs. That is, X,,-
represents the number of gene sequences from the ith sample that
are classified as belonging to the jth OTU. To reduce dimension of
the count matrix, OTUs that have no recorded observations for all
the samples can be ignored, resulting in K effective OTUs that have
at least one sample with non—zero count. For ease of presentation
and focused simulation study, we describe the notation and pro—
posed methodologies for clustering samples. Of equal interest is
clustering OTUs to reveal microbiota community substructures.
This can be accomplished by simply transposing the X matrix;
the proposed methodologies apply as we demonstrate in an example
in Section 4.1.

2.2 Kendall’s distance
Kendall’s r—distance is a measure of dissimilarity between two sam—
ples when the observations within samples are integer valued.

Originally proposed as a measure of dissimilarity between two
ranking systems with no ties (Kendall, 1938), the distance can be
extended to samples having non—integer values. Further, several ex—
tensions have been proposed for calculation of the r—distance when
there are ties (Bansal and Fernandez—Baca, 2009). We use the version
in Fagin et a1. (2004), which defines the r—distance between any two
samples X,- and X,- as

+ M109, : XiMXI-u # xiv)

r(X,-,X,-) : 1((x,,, — x,,)(x,- — x,,) < 0)

+209, yé Xi,)I(X,-, : m]

where 0 S 7» S 1 is a tuning parameter and I is the usual indicator
function. The r—distance measures the number of pairs that do not
agree in their ordering in the samples (first term) and, with a penalty,
the number of pairs that are tied in only one of the samples. Properties
of the r—distance are dictated by the tuning parameter 7». The r—dis—
tance is a proper distance metric only if % S 7» S 1 (Fagin et (11.,
2004). To be able to use metric MDS with a norm that satisfies the tri—
angle inequality, we restrict ourselves to 7» Z  In our simulation and
data analysis, we set 7» : 1 / 2. The resulting n X 71 matrix of dissimilar—
ities D : (Dy-)1 Sign is symmetric, with D,,- : t(X,-,X,-).

2.3 Metric MDS

PCoA involves calculating the largest eigenvalues of the distance ma—
trix. To construct a d—dimensional PCoA model, the first d eigenvec—
tors are used to determine the coordinates. An alternative to this
approach is metric MDS, where the aim is to represent the samples
on a d—dimensional Euclidean space as vectors Y1,Y2,  ,Yn so
that for a given norm  - ll, HY,- — Yill approximates the dissimilarity
D,,-. This is achieved by minimizing the stress function

n—1 n 2
s 2 Z Z (llYi — Yin, — D17) . <2>
i:1/':i+1

Since 8 increases with the number of samples, its standardized form,
, is used as the convergence criterion. This approach

 

 

s

gives the freedom to use different norms to study the representation
of the data on the coordinate system. The dimension d is usually set
to be small (less than or equal to 4) for ease of graphical representa—
tion. Regarding the norm, any [p (p > 0) norm can be used

for metric MDS, where the It, norm is given by HY; —Y]-Hp :

(21:1 (Yim — imlp)1/p. Typical choices are Manhattan (i.e. l1) and
Euclidean (i.e. 12) norms. In the current study, we focus on
metric MDS models constructed using 11 norm (11—MDS) and 12
norm (PCoA). The fact that metric MDS with 12 norm reduces to the
PCoA model was mentioned earlier.

2.4 Clustering

Graphical visualization of MDS models is a very basic exploratory
tool to study clustering of samples. However, visual demarcation
of clusters is not accurate and is statistically invalid. Standard
clustering tools such as k—means and k—nearest neighbors require
the number of clusters to be provided prior to constructing the clus—
ters. In some studies, the samples may be clustered prior to analysis
using other attributes recorded. For example, when studying the
bacterial composition of various body habitats, the samples can be
taken as clustered by the sites from which they are collected.

However, to study the composition of subcommunities in an un—
biased fashion, we need to determine the optimal number of clusters
to be used. As such, we propose a modified version of PAM
(Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1987), from which the optimal number
of clusters can be determined internally using the silhouette plot
(Rousseeuw, 1987).

Average silhouette width is calculated by varying the number
of clusters over a finite range and selecting the value for which the
maximum average width is attained. This may however result in
over—estimation of the number of clusters, due to insignificant
amount of increase in the silhouette width contributed by sub—clus—
tering, as we saw in Supplementary Figure S1. To overcome this
shortcoming so that the optimum number of clusters is more robust
to futile sub—clustering, we propose a novel automated procedure
for selection of optimal number of clusters, leading to the mPAM
procedure for clustering. The proposed method works as follows.
Let (wm, Wm+1, . . . ,w5_1) denote the average silhouette widths cor—
responding to the number of clusters being m,m + 1,  ,c — 1,
where the minimum number of clusters, m, and the maximum num—
ber of clusters, 6 — 1, are problem dependent and can be specified by
users. Let W : (W[1],W[2], . . . ) denote the vector of widths sorted in
descending order such that all in W are within \l/ X tum of the max—
imum width Lam and with 51,52, . . . being the corresponding num—
bers of clusters such that s,- < 51. We select 51 as the optimal number
of clusters only if Wm is significantly larger than the rest of the sil—
houette width (i.e. W only contains wm. Otherwise, we find
Wm : min,-{(ww — W[1])/($,' — 51)}, which represents the minimum
loss of information per step, and the corresponding 5,- is taken to be
the optimal number of clusters. Note that \ll serves as a tuning par—
ameter controlling the size of the number of clusters. We would rec—
ommend setting \ll to be a small number (say between 0 and 0.1) to
balance over—estimation by PAM (when \ll : 0) and under—estimation
(if \ll is set too large), as we discuss in more detail below.

2.5 Misclassification error (MCE) measure

If the true clustering of observations is known, as in a simulation
study or based on other attributes of the samples, performance of
the optimal clusters determined by mPAM can be assessed using the
Rand Index (Hubert and Arabie, 1985). For a dataset with n sam—
ples, suppose that the optimal number of clusters determined
by mPAM is b and the true number of clusters in the dataset is a.
Let C1,C2,  ,Ca be the true clusters that partition the indices
{1,2,  ,n} and D1,D2,  ,Db denote the clusters determined
using mPAM. The estimated clusters are different from the true if
a pair of observations in the same true cluster are in different
estimated clusters or vice versa. The following quantity, MCE,
essentially 1 — RandIndex, can be used to assess the performance of
a clustering scheme:

This measure is equal to zero if and only if the true and estimated
clusters are equivalent. Both over— and under—estimation of the

number of clusters will result in a positive MCE value; the larger the
MCE value, the worse the performance.

3 Simulation study

We conducted a simulation study to compare the performance
of PCoA and 11—MDS with a dimension between two and four for
a number of factors: estimation of the number of clusters, classifica—
tion errors and graphical representation for visualization (i.e. tight—
ness of clusters). We consider the following two models for
generating metagenomic count data.

Model I. In this model, 8 clusters were generated consisting of 40
samples each. The number of OTUs is set to be 200. Within each
cluster, each OTU was randomly assigned a zero or non—zero count
with a probability of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. That is, the
counts for the lath feature of the jth sample in the ith cluster were
generated as

Xijk N UikNB(j-ik71)+(1 — Uik7NB(107 (7-01),
1,, ~ NB(100, 1), U”, ~ Bernoulli(0.3),
for1gigs,1g/g40,1gkgzoo.

In words, for any given cluster, each OTU is selected to have non—
zero count with probability 0.3 and held fixed for all samples within
the cluster. The non—zero counts are sampled to have means coming
from a negative binomial distribution, and the actual counts are in
turn generated from a negative binomial distribution. Further, to in—
corporate sequencing errors for OTUs with zero counts, the zero
counts are modeled as a zero—inﬂated negative binomial variable,
given by the second term in the expression for Xiik.

Model H. We used the metagenomic count data of Costello et al.
(2009) to more realistically model the parameters for generating ran—
dom samples in this construction. The Costello et a]. study considered
bacterial community across body habitats. Variable region V2 of the
16S rRNA gene was amplified to obtain highly classifiable gene se—
quences which were then matched to a reference genome to generate
the metagenomic count data. We used the counts at the family level of
taxonomy to model our parameters. The dataset consists of a total of
312 taxa and we modeled counts from these taxa as follows.

We considered the following 10 body sites: hair, gut, external
auditory canal, nostril, oral cavity, left/right axilla, palm, popliteal
fossa, plantar foot and glans penis or labia minora. For each body
site, we assume the counts for each taxa follow a negative binomial
distribution and estimate the mean (u) and dispersion parameter ((1)).
We screened out taxa with total count less than 5 and after estimat—
ing the negative binomial parameters, we selected, for each body
site, the 40 taxa with the highest means as representatives for
that body site. This leads to a clear distinction between the clusters
(body sites). For the remaining 272 taxa, we used a zero—inﬂated
negative binomial with mean 1 and dispersion 106. This is done to
reﬂect the sparse nature of count data, and the non—zero counts add
noise into the model and reduce the ability to demarcate the clusters.
The model can be expressed as

Representative taxa : Xiik ~ NB(u,-k, (1%), k : i1, . . . ,i4o,
Noise taxa : x,-,-,a ~ Z,,-kNB(1,106),

Zil-k ~ Bernoulli(0.3), k : 1'41, ... ,i312,

for 1 S i S 10 body sites and 1 S j S 20 samples. Note that dif—
ferent body sites have different sets of representative taxa, and

therefore the indexes for the top forty taxa, (i1, . . . ,i4o), differ from

body site to body site, hence the notation.

3.1 Estimation accuracy and visualization

We calculated the optimal number of clusters using mPAM for both
11—MDS and PCoA, each for dimensions 2, 3 and 4. To quantify the
clustering performance of the various models, we also calculated
the misclassification errors, M CE. Boxplots for both measures based
on 1000 randomly generated samples are presented in Figure 1.
Under both simulation models, PCoA underestimates the number of
clusters, although this downward bias gets smaller as the dimension
increases. 11—MDS also underestimates the number of clusters under
model II when the dimension is small. Though, we note that
the underestimation is not as severe as with PCoA, with 4D l1—MDS
correctly recovering the true number (10) as its median over the
1000 replications. Further, PCoA models have much higher MCE
than their 11—MDS counterparts. For both methods, the MCE de—
creases as the number of dimension increases, though.

For a random realization of data generated under Model I, the
average silhouette width plots are given in Supplementary Figure S2,
from which one can see that PAM and mPAM will lead to the same
estimations of the numbers of clusters for all models. 2D models and
a snapshot showing the 3D models are presented in Figure 2. The two
2D plots display over— and under—estimation of the true number of
clusters under the 11—MDS and the PCoA models, respectively. This is
shown in the graphs by encircling the misrepresented clusters. While
the two clusters encircled in the 11—MDS model correspond to a single
true cluster, the encircled cluster in the PCoA model contains three
true clusters. However, this error in estimation is not seen in the 3D
models, with both 11—MDS and PCoA producing the correct number
of clusters without any misclassification (Supplementary Table S1).
However, for both the 2D and 3D representations, the clusters from
the 11—MDS models are much tighter than their PCoA counterparts.

those for the 4D models lead to similar observations (Supplementary
Materials S1 and Figs. S3—S10).

The 3D and 4D visualization for a randomly generated dataset
under model H are provided in Figure 3. While the corresponding
silhouette width plots are given in Supplementary Figure S11.
Additional information and plots are also available in Supplementary
Materials S2 and Figures S12—S19. For l1—MDS, the 2D model with
mPAM underestimates the number of clusters, while PAM overesti—
mates. In contrast, the 3D and 4D models provide good estimates of
the number of clusters under mPAM (9 and 10 for 3D and 4D,
respectively), whereas PAM still leads to an overestimation for the 3D
model (13 clusters). Conversely, the PCoA models grossly underesti—
mate the number of clusters, even for 3 and 4 dimensions, leading to
large MCE (see Supplementary Table S2 for details). Note that for
PCoA, as we can see from Supplementary Figure S11, PAM would
provide the same estimates as mPAM, indicating underestimation is
an inherent feature of PCoA, not the measure for cluster estimation.

The results for both simulation models demonstrate that 11—MDS
outperforms PCoA when the measure of dissimilarity is the
Kendall’s r—distance. To see if these results are invariant of the
distance measure used, we used a different measure, the Jensen—
Shannon divergence metric, as an alternative. The Jensen—Shannon
divergence is commonly used for count data in bioinformatics
(Romero et (11., 2014) and genome—comparison (Sims et (11., 2009).
The results, presented in Supplementary Materials S3 and Figure
S20, are similar to those shown in Figure 1. This substantiates our
conclusion that 11—MDS outperforms its PCoA counterpart in terms
of MCE and estimation of number of clusters.

3.2 mPAM versus PAM
The proposed method for selecting the optimal number of clus—
ters, mPAM, is driven by the fact that the maximum average

results from the 3D and 4D I1-MDS models, while the second row contains
the corresponding results from the PCoA models. The X, y, and z, are the
coordinates from the I1-MDS or PCoA models. The different gray levels
(and colors in the online version) represent different clusters predicted by
mPAM. Note that the plots are snapshots (and only a single 3D projection for
the 4D model), with interactive views available from the software website
provided

silhouette width, in some cases, is not the best measure for se—
lecting the number of clusters (see Supplementary Figs. S1, S11),
in which PAM may (when PAM and mPAM do not agree) over
estimate the number of clusters due to insignificant amount of
increase in silhouette width. Hence, we expect the mPAM esti—
mates to be smaller than those of PAM. To gain a better under—
standing of the relative performance of those two measures, we
repeated the analysis of model II, but this time using PAM for
estimating the number of clusters. Side—by—side barplots of the
relative frequencies of biases in the estimated numbers of clusters
(mPAM—10 and PAM—10) are given in Figure 4 (for 4D 11—MDS
with two different \ll values, 0.01 and 0.1). As we can see from
the figure, mPAM clearly outperforms PAM (which can lead to
large positive bias), and the results are not very sensitive to the
selection of the tuning parameter \ll for 4D l1—MDS. Additional
details for comparison between mPAM and PAM and plots with
various \ll values and dimensions are provided in Supplementary
Materials S4 and Figures S21 and 22. Although Figure 4 shows
little sensitivity of the results to \ll, in general, as mentioned ear—
lier, \ll’s specification is related to the selection of the optimal
number of clusters. More specifically, 01:0 leads to the PAM es—
timator (potential overestimation); as \ll increases, the estimated
number of clusters decreases in general (Fig. S23), leading to the

4 Two data analysis examples

To demonstrate the utility of GrammR, we applied it to two
datasets: the human body habitats of Costello et al. (2009) and the
fecal data of Yatsunenko et al. (2012). For the Costello data, we
will not only illustrate clustering of samples, but also clustering
of taxa.

4.1 Analysis of Costello data

The data from Costello et al. (2009) contain counts over various
body sites of the 16s rRNA, and thus Unifrac with 2D PCoA were
used in the original analysis to study the bacteria composition
of body habitats given the existance of the phylogenetic tree. Our
goal of this reanalysis is to demonstrate the importance of higher—
dimensional analysis, and to compare PCoA with l1—MDS. The 4D
l1—MDS analysis reveals an interesting and significant observation
that was not apparent in the lower—dimensional analysis or using
PCoA. That is, the oral cavity samples that were directly collected
from the mouth and tongue were clustered together while those
that are in fact transplant samples made up a different cluster
(Supplementary Materials S5 and Table S3).

In the following, we also illustrate the ability of GrammR for
clustering taxa with OTUs using the 45 gut samples. Of the 312
taxa at the bacteria family level, 257 did not have any recorded
sequences classified to them, resulting in zero counts for all the sam—
ples for these taxa and were thus excluded from consideration.
We analyzed the remaining 55 taxa by constructing l1—MDS and
PCoA models of dimensions 2, 3 and 4. The 2D l1—MDS results
showing four estimated clusters with 12, 16, 11, and 16 taxa are
presented in Figure 5. In contrast, for 2D PCoA, only three taxa—
Comamonadaceae, Moraxellaceae and Caulobacteraceae—are
observed to belong to a separate cluster, with the rest make up
another cluster (Supplementary Fig. S24). Apart from having fewer
number of clusters and a lopsided membership, another notable dif—
ference is the multidimensional model axes. We can see that clusters
in the PCoA model have much smaller spread compared to those
in the l1—MDS model.

4.2 Analysis of the Yatsunenko data

The Yatsunenko et al. (2012) data were obtained from the
fecal samples of 252 adults and 176 infants living in three
countries—USA, Venezuela and Malawi. The differences in bacterial
composition among samples from the different countries is of inter—
est. This is used as another example to demonstrate the benefits of
higher dimensional analysis using GrammR using OTU information.
After preprocessing and filtering (see Supplementary Materials S6
for detail), we were left with 4899 OTUs. Our analysis of the data
from the 252 adults show that the 4D models (but not the 2D or 3D
models) are capable of separating the samples from the different
countries. For example, for l1—MDS, the 2D models lead to the iden—
tification of three clusters, but the samples from Malawi and
Venezuela are being grouped together, whereas the samples from
USA are split into two clusters. In contrast, when 4D models are
constructed, one can see a clear separation of samples from the three

countries. This is true for both the l1—MDS model (Supplementary
Fig. S25) and the PCoA model (Supplementary Fig. S26), although
the clusters are much tighter for l1—MDS than PCoA, a phenomenon
that we have seen in the other examples.

5 Discussion

In this article, we present a novel tool for graphical representation and
clustering of metagenomic count data. In particular, we propose
mPAM, a modified silhouette width measure for determining
the number of clusters in conjunction with the PAM clustering
method. In addition, we investigated and compared two methods for
dimension reduction with different number of dimensionality in the
projected space. Results from simulation clearly indicate the need to
explore projections to a dimension greater than two. We further dem—
onstrate the use of the novel tool for two datasets that would benefit
from being considered from a higher—dimensional perspective.

While the original distance matrix (without being projected into
a lower dimensional space) can be used directly for clustering,
mPAM clustering based on the projected data is in fact advanta—
geous due to better separation obtained from minimizing the stress
function in l1—MDS, especially if the projected dimension is relatively
large (say 4D). We illustrate this using data generated from model II
(Supplementary Materials S7 and Fig. S27).

Kendall’s r—distance is proposed to be used as a measure of dis—
similarity for metagenomic count data, which is a useful tool for
multidimensional modeling when the phylogenetic tree is not avail—
able. However, calculation of the r—distance is computationally
intensive, with the computation time being 0012/22), where n is the
number of samples and k is the number of OTUs. A study on the
computational time taken to compute the Kendall’s r—distance
using GrammR for various sample sizes and OTUs is provided in
Supplementary Materials S8 and Table S4. For example, for a data—
set with 100 samples and 2000 OTUs, it took a little bit over 2 min
to complete the computation. We note that there are several poten—
tial methods (Bansal and Fernandez—Baca, 2009; Dietz, 1989) that
can lead to speed up of the computation, which will be considered
in a future release of GrammR.

A general class of metric MDS models is proposed for dimension
reduction, enabling informative graphical visualization of data.

The popular PCoA model with two—dimensional projection is in fact
a special case of this class. Comparison of PCoA and another metric
MDS model, l1—MDS, for two simulation models appears to show
that PCoA frequently underestimate the true number of clusters,
although the biases tend to get smaller with a higher—dimensional
projection. Regardless of which metric MDS model is used, the ben—
efit of using a dimension greater than two is clearly demonstrated
in both the simulation and the real data applications. While two—
dimensional models are easier to present on paper and thus popular,
we would like to emphasize the benefit of higher dimensional repre—
sentations, and that our method and accompanying software pro—
vide an interactive visualization tool for examining results for
dimensions up to four. As seen in simulation studies, higher dimen—
sional models reduce error of misclassification. Also, the optimal
number of clusters used in these models gets closer to the true num—
ber of clusters with an increase in dimension. While a single graphi—
cal representation of a dimension greater than three is not feasible,
one can construct representations selecting three directions at a
time to get a series of rotatable 3D plots for closer examination.
This, however, is not recommendable for dimensions much
greater than 4, as the number of such representations increases at a
polynomial rate.

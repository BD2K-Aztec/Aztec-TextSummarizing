Abstract

Motivation: The design of de novo circuits with predefined performance specifications is a chal—
lenging problem in Synthetic Biology. Computational models and tools have proved to be crucial
for a successful wet lab implementation. Natural gene circuits are complex, subject to evolutionary
tradeoffs and playing multiple roles. However, most synthetic designs implemented to date are
simple and perform a single task. As the field progresses, advanced computational tools are
needed in order to handle greater levels of circuit complexity in a more flexible way and consider—
ing multiple design criteria.

Results: This works presents SYNBADm (SYNthetic Biology Automated optimal Design in Matlab),
a software toolbox for the automatic optimal design of gene circuits with targeted functions from
libraries of components. This tool makes use of global optimization to simultaneously search the
space of structures and kinetic parameters. SYNBADm can efficiently handle high levels of circuit
complexity and can consider multiple design criteria through multiobjective optimization. Further,
it provides flexible design capabilities, i.e. the user can define the modeling framework, library of
components and target performance function(s).

Availability and Implementation: SYNBADm runs under the popular MATLAB computational en—
vironment, and is available under GPLV3 license at https://sites.google.com/site/synbadm

1 Introduction

 

Computer-aided design (CAD) is fundamental in modern engineer-
ing. During the last decade, many efforts in the context of Synthetic
Biology have been dedicated to incorporate CAD as part of the
forward-engineering design cycle (Arpino et (11., 2013). Marchisio
(2014) and Huynh and Tagkopoulos (2014) offer a comprehensive
review of computational tools for the design of synthetic biological
circuits. The GEC language by Pedersen and Phillips (2009) and the
Parts 8c Pools framework by Marchisio and Stelling (2008, 2011)
are pioneering works conceptualizing modular computational de-
sign of synthetic gene circuits. Both tools use search algorithms not
based on optimization to explore designs compatible with pre-
specifications. Automated design of biocircuits was first formulated
as an optimization problem in Optcircuit (Dasika and Maranas,

2008) and Genetdes (Rodrigo et (11., 2007). Optimization-based al-
gorithms ensure a more efficient search in the design space, attempt-
ing to find the circuit with overall best possible performance. In
contrast to GEC and Parts 8c Pools, neither Optcircuit nor Genetdes
are suitable for modular design. In terms of modularity,
AutoBioCad (Rodrigo and Jaramillo, 2012), SBROME (Huynh
et (11., 2013) and iBioSim (Myers et (11., 2009; Roenher and Myers,
2014) made an important step forward. SBROME allows reusing
preexisting constructs, and its extension by Huynh and
Tagkopoulos (2014) identifies the smallest number of modules for a
specified function. iBioSim handles module reuse, operates at a low
specification level and do not account for biological diversity.
Biological diversity (one functional behavior can be carried out by
different biological processes) is important when all topologies

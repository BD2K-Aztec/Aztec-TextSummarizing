Abstract

Summary: Herein, we present CONSRANK, a web tool for analyzing, comparing and ranking
protein—protein and protein—nucleic acid docking models, based on the conservation of inter—
residue contacts and its visualization in 2D and 3D interactive contact maps.

Availability and implementation: CONSRANK is accessible as a public web tool at https://www.

Algorithms for macromolecular docking and relative scoring
functions, as monitored in the Critical Assessment of Predicted
Interactions (CAPRI) experiment, are constantly progressing
(Lensink and Wodak, 2013). However, to date no program can
provide a single docking solution with a high—enough confidence
to be correct. Docking programs instead generally provide the
user with an ensemble of models, corresponding to a subset (usu—
ally refined) of the solutions they generated in the conformational
sampling step. The user is thus left with the issue of analyzing
the ensemble of obtained models, maybe from different docking
programs, and scoring them to hopefully single out the correct
ones.

In this context, we have previously proposed to derive a consen—
sus from an ensemble of protein—protein docking models, based on
the conservation within them of the inter—residue contacts (Vangone
et (11., 2012). We have also proposed the visualization of such con—
sensus in a ‘consensus contact map’, i.e. an intermolecular contact
map where the contacts’ conservation is reported on a gray scale.
Interestingly, when analyzing several CAPRI targets, we observed

that a significant fraction of native contacts was included within the
contacts with highest conservation rate, even in the cases where only
a small percentage of solutions were correct.

Based on this observation, we then developed a consensus ap—
proach to the scoring and ranking of docking models, CONSRANK
(CONSensus—RANKing), which ranks models based on their ability
to match the most conserved contacts in the ensemble they belong to
(Oliva et (11., 2013). Application of CONSRANK to the ranking of
over 110 targets from different sources showed a very good per—
formance, as it was able to consistently enrich the top ranked pos—
itions in correct solutions, provided that they represented an
appreciable fraction of the total models (3% was enough for the
CAPRI prediction sets, coming from different programs and pre—
dictors). Importantly, CONSRANK was shown to perform signifi—
cantly better than a simple RMSD—based consensus method
(Vangone et (11., 2013). This means that although the consensus ap—
proach clearly has a potential per se, the frequency of inter—residue
contacts used by CONSRANK is a particularly effective measure to
highlight the consensus itself.

Herein, we present the CONSRANK server, which integrates the
above analyses, extends them to protein—DNA and protein—RNA
complexes, and makes them easily available to the scientific
community through an advanced interactive web interface (at
the URL: https://www.molnac.unisa.it/BioTools/consrank/). The
CONSRANK input consists of an ensemble of docking models in
the PDB format (Berman et (11., 2000). A user—friendly interface
allows the user to upload the input PDB files separately or in an
archive (.tar, .tar.gz or .zip) file. The user is also requested to specify
the chain identifiers for the molecules involved in the interaction to
be analyzed. Interactors made of two chains (e.g. antibodies) can
also be dealt with. As we have shown that the CONSRANK ap—
proach is particularly effective in ranking models obtained by differ—
ent docking algorithms, we also provide a tool to consistently
renumber a set of diverse PDB files.

CONSRANK outputs are displayed on the results HTML page
for one week and archived as downloadable compressed files. A link
to the online resource is also emailed to the user, if requested. One
thousand models with two molecular chains about 15 0—residues
long are processed in 2min. Performance scales linearly to 20 min
for 10 000 models. CONSRANK output includes in the main page
user—sortable and searchable tables reporting: (i) a list of the inter—
residue contacts observed in at least 1% of the models, with relative
conservation rate (Vangone et (11., 2012); (ii) the ranking of the sub—
mitted models based on the CONSRANK normalized score (Oliva
et (11., 2013); (iii) parameters (C50, C70, C90) reflecting the overall
conservation of inter—residue contacts in the models ensemble
(Vangone et (11., 2012).

Further, CONSRANK shows in the output main page a static
consensus map. Clicking on it, an interactive map is provided that
can be zoomed and navigated to visualize the identity of the residue
pairs corresponding to a given contact (dot) and its conservation
rate. Finally, an interactive 3D representation of the consensus map,
a ‘3D consensus map’, where the third dimension is given by the
conservation rate of each inter—residue contact, is also provided.
Contacts with a conservation rate below 0.01 (i.e. present in <1%
of the models) are not shown in the 3D map.

Once the general output has been generated, the user can choose
to perform further analyses on single models, by clicking on the ac—
tion boxes next to each model name, in the ranking table. In particu—
lar, by clicking on the relative box, CONSRANK will calculate the
inter—molecular contact map for a given model and will color conse—
quently the corresponding contacts in the interactive 2D and 3D
consensus maps. This analysis takes few seconds and can be applied
to as many models as the user likes. Results relative to the last three
analyzed models are contemporarily reported, in different colors, in
the maps. This helps the user to visualize at a glance how much the
models resemble each other and how well each of them reﬂects the
overall consensus. Furthermore, by clicking on the ‘Cocomaps’ box,
the COCOMAPS server will be launched on the selected model, to
provide detailed information on its interface, including the interface
area, a list of the inter—molecular H—bonds and an online 3D visual—
ization of the complex in JMol (http://www.jmol.org/) (Vangone
et (11., 2011 

An example of CONSRANK 3D maps is shown in Figure 1 for
the CAPRI target T46. T46 was a difficult target, as both compo—
nents were to be homology built. Predictors were however able to
include 13 correct solutions among the total 387 submitted models.
CONSRANK can efficiently rank them, so that all its top 10 pos—
itions are occupied by correct models. In Figure 1, the CONSRANK
3D map is reported for the ‘consensus’, calculated on the total 387
models, with contacts matched by the first and 100th ranked models

Fig. 1. CONSRANK 3D maps for the CAPRI target T46, showing the consensus
contacts for the ensemble of 387 models (gray). (A) Contacts present in the
model ranked first, and (B) contacts present in the model ranked 100th are
highlighted

differently colored. As only about 3% of the models are correct, the
contacts conservation rate is overall quite low, but still the native
contacts clearly emerge from the background, correctly driving the
ranking. Model ranked first, which is indeed a correct solution, ob—
viously matches the most conserved contacts (Fig. 1A). As for the
clearly incorrect model ranked 100th (Fig. 1B), as expected most of
its contacts have a low conservation rate (note that more than half
of them are not visualized in the 3D map because their conservation
is too low). However, it also presents one of the best conserved con—
tacts, between receptor Leu5 7 and ligand Ile115, that is indeed a na—
tive one, being present in the corresponding X—ray structure [PDB
ID: 3Q87 (Liger et (11., 2011)]. This confirms that the conservation
of native inter—residue contacts may be contributed by incorrect so—
lutions (Oliva et (11., 2013; Vangone et (11., 2012), also in line with
previous results by Lensink and Wodak (2010). By analyzing 20
CAPRI targets, they indeed showed that about one—quarter of the
interfaces in models ranked as incorrect in the CAPRI assessment
are actually correctly predicted. These findings highlight the import—
ance of a thorough analysis of a set of docking models in terms of in—
ter—residue contacts.

CONSRANK, the interactive and user—friendly web tool we pro—
pose here, has in fact most of the desirable features that can make
this analysis easy and exhaustive. Starting from an ensemble of the

the most conserved contacts and offers a user—customizable graph—
ical representation, including a straightforward and effective com—
parison of different docking solutions.

Abstract

Motivation: Insertion sequences (ISs) are transposable elements present in most bacterial and
archaeal genomes that play an important role in genomic evolution. The increasing availability of
sequenced prokaryotic genomes offers the opportunity to study ISs comprehensively, but develop—
ment of efficient and accurate tools is required for discovery and annotation. Additionally, prokary—
otic genomes are frequently deposited as incomplete, or draft stage because of the substantial cost
and effort required to finish genome assembly projects. Development of methods to identify IS dir—
ectly from raw sequence reads or draft genomes are therefore desirable. Software tools such as
Optimized Annotation System for Insertion Sequences and IScan currently identify IS elements in
completely assembled and annotated genomes; however, to our knowledge no methods have
been developed to identify ISs from raw fragment data or partially assembled genomes. We have
developed novel methods to solve this computationally challenging problem, and implemented
these methods in the software package ISQuest. This software identifies bacterial ISs and their se—
quence elements—inverted and direct repeats—in raw read data or contigs using flexible search
parameters. ISQuest is capable of finding ISs in hundreds of partially assembled genomes within
hours, making it a valuable high—throughput tool for a global search of IS elements. We tested
ISQuest on simulated read libraries of 3810 complete bacterial genomes and plasmids in GenBank
and were capable of detecting 82% of the ISs and transposases annotated in GenBank with 80% se—
quence identity.

The ever—increasing number of sequenced bacterial and archaeal
genomes provides an opportunity to understand their architecture
and evolution. However, as new high—throughput sequencing meth—
ods are developed, annotation quickly becomes the bottleneck for
genomic research. In addition to open reading frames (ORFs) and
regulatory elements, correct annotation of other features such as
mobile genetic elements (MGEs) is also essential. These MGEs in—
clude bacteriophages, conjugative transposons, integrons, unit trans—
posons, composite transposons and insertion sequences (155). Such
transposable elements are defined as specific DNA segments that

155 are transposable elements that are regarded as genomic parasites
proliferating in their host and surviving only through horizontal
gene transfer (Schaack et (11., 2010). 155 play a major role in genome
evolution and plasticity, mediating gene transfers and promoting
genome duplication, deletion and rearrangement (Frost et (11., 2005 ).
Insertion sequences may be abundant in host genomes and are intim—
ately involved in mediating horizontal gene transfer, generation of
pseudogenes, genomic rearrangement and alteration of regulatory
elements (Frost et (11., 2005; Schaack et (11., 2010). Experimental
evolution in the laboratory has demonstrated that both

transpositions (Chou et (11., 2009; Schneider et (11., 2000) and re—
arrangements (Chou and Marx, 2012; Cooper et (11., 2001; Dunham
et (11., 2002; Lee and Marx, 2012; Zhong et (11., 2004) can generate
beneficial mutations. Prokaryotic DDE transposons (mainly ISs) can
move in two different ways, depending on the donor site.
Replicative transposons copy their DNA, leaving the parent site in—
tact, while conservative transposons cut themselves out of the donor
molecule in order to paste their DNA into the target.

Despite the development of various annotation programs for
particular genomic features, some important features such as inser—
tion sequences (ISs), the smallest and simplest autonomous MGEs,
remain poorly annotated. In many cases, annotations of these elem—
ents include only ORFs and ignore terminal inverted repeats (TIRs),
which are an essential feature of their activity in mediating gene re—
arrangements. Moreover, partial ISs are rarely annotated, leading to
the loss of potentially valuable evolutionary information. Another
major limitation of current tools is the requirement of a complete
annotated genome sequence for IS identification and analysis.

The majority of ISs are between 700 and 3000 bp and possess
one or two ORFs that encode transposases or helper proteins. For
an IS element with more than one ORF, the first (upstream) ORF en—
codes a DNA recognition domain, while the second overlapping
ORF encodes the catalytic domain. There are two types of IS: ISs
carrying TIRs elements; and ISs not carrying TIR elements. A TIR IS
element carries a pair of partially conserved 7 to 20 bp inverted re—
peats at its terminus for cleavage and binding of the transposase.
Upon insertion, ISs often generate short directed repeats from 2 to
14 bp immediately outside the IRs (Mahillon and Chandler, 1998).
ISs of the non—TIR type do not have discernible conserved inverted
repeats.

Metagenomic analysis has revealed that IS transposases are
among the most abundant and ubiquitous genes in nature (Aziz
et (11., 2010). Based on transposase sequence similarities, ISs have
been classified in 25 different families that belong to three main
classes of enzymes: DDE transposases; serine recombinases and
tyrosine recombinases (Mahillon and Chandler, 1998). Another re—
cent classification of ISs categorizes them into 26 families based on
transposase homology and overall organization, with some families
divided further into groups (Zhou et (11., 2008). An IS family can be
defined as a collection of elements sharing conserved spacers be—
tween key residues, identical genetic organization, similar terminal
sequence arrangements and uniform target insertion behavior.
However, not all families are so coherent. Consequently, some (e.g.
families IS4 and IS5) are divided into subgroups composed of a core
of closely related elements that can be linked to other members of
the family by weaker but still significant similarities. The naming
convention of transposable elements (insertion sequences, trans—
posons, etc.) generally follows the recommendations of Campbell
et al. (Chumley et (11., 1979). However, in some cases a revised sys—
tem of IS naming is used based on a registry where researchers can
request for a new sequence number to define novel mobile elements
(Roberts et (11., 2008). IS and transposable element abundance in
prokaryotes is highly variable (Touchon and Rocha, 2007) but they
occupy a substantial fraction of some genomes. For example, 1 1 and
25% of the genome in Clostridium difficile and Enterococcus faeca—
[is is composed of mobile elements (Paulsen et (11., 2003; Sebaihia
et (11., 2006). Therefore, it is estimated that an average of up to 10%
of bacterial (Mahillon and Chandler, 1998) and archaeal (Filee
et (11., 2007) genomes are comprised of MGEs.

Current IS—related software tools such as IScan and Optimized
Annotation System for Insertion Sequences (OASIS) operate only on
complete genomes with fully annotated ORFs. Complete genome

assembly of a single strain of bacteria can be time—consuming and
costly, due in large part to ambiguities introduced by repetitive
elements themselves. Consequently, most publicly available pro—
karyotic genomes are deposited as incomplete, contig— or scaffold—
level assemblies, and IS and other repetitive elements may or may
not be present in the deposited sequence. For example, Celera WGS
(Myers et (11., 2000), a widely used assembly software, commonly
moves full or partial IS elements to a ‘degenerates’ folder that is not
frequently deposited as part of the draft genome. Therefore, to per—
form a global investigation of ISs in unassembled prokaryote gen—
omes, we developed ISQuest, or Insertion Sequence Quest, a
computational tool for automated detection of ISs in unassembled
or partially assembled genomes. ISQuest takes advantage of widely
available transposase annotations to identify candidate IS seed re—
gions and then uses a computationally efficient extension method
based on BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1990) to grow the seed regions and
identify the edges of each IS element. ISQuest is capable of finding
MGEs in hundreds of genomes within hours, making it a valuable
high—throughput tool for a global search of IS elements. We applied
ISQuest to 3810 sequenced bacterial genome and plasmid se—
quences. Compared with the benchmark of GenBank annotations,
ISQuest identified 82% successfully with 80% sequence identity.

The abundance and diversity of MGE elements in prokaryotic gen—
omes poses significant challenges in automated identification and
annotation using computational methods. The ISFinder database is
currently the most comprehensive dedicated resource for high—qual—
ity, manually curated ISs annotations (ISFinder at https://www—is.
biotoul.fr/). Therefore, we assume this database to be an accurate
set of ISs, but incomplete because genomes are being sequenced
faster than they are annotated to this extent. However, several stud—
ies have used the referenced sequences in the ISFinder database to
mine various collections of genomic data using BLAST—based soft—
ware (Cerveau, et (11., 2011; Filee et (11., 2007; Leclercq and
Cordaux, 2011; Mahillon and Chandler, 1998; Wagner, 2006).

The development of high—throughput sequencing techniques has
led to the availability of thousands of sequenced genomes and meta—
genomes that require automated identification of ISs. Genome anno—
tation pipelines such as Prokka (Seemann, 2014) and Institute for
Genome Sciences (2015 ) stop at the point of labeling ORFs as ‘trans—
posase’ or ‘integrase’ where sufficient homology is observed.
Without classification of ISs into families and enumeration within
genomes, broad—scale comparison studies across closely related
strains are not possible. The first automated approach to annotate
ISs was used for an analysis of 19 cyanobacterial and 31 archaeal
genomes, but this has yet to be made publicly available as an auto—
mated pipeline (Zhou et (11., 2008). ISSaga is a web application pipe—
line that allows semi—automated IS annotation in complete genomes
(Varani et (11., 2011). ISSaga employs a library—based method using
BLAST seeded with the ISFinder sequences to classify ORFs into IS
families. Although ISSaga represents significant progress in auto—
mated IS annotation, the efficiency of this approach in identifying
transposable elements is questionable due to its dependency on the
ISFinder database; ISSaga cannot automatically identify novel ISs
not already present in ISFinder. IScan is a publicly available applica—
tion that makes use of BLAST with a single reference transposase se—
quence per IS family to scan whole genomes for ISs, and includes in
its prediction pipeline searches for transposases and inverted and
direct repeats (Wagner et (11., 2007). IScan was used to investigate

9103 ‘Org JSanV 110 salaﬁuv soc] ‘BtHJOJtIBQ JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'S[BIIJUO[pJOJXO'SOIJBLUJOJIIIOIq/ﬂduq 11101} pQPBOIII/IAOG

ISs in 438 prokaryotic genomes and found a limited number of ISs
in most taxa (Wagner and de la Chaux, 2008). OASIS is another
publicly available computational tool for automated annotation of
ISs (Robinson et al., 2012) in whole genomes. OASIS takes advan—
tage of widely available transposase annotations to identify candi—
date ISs and then uses a computationally efficient maximum
likelihood method of multiple sequence alignment to identify the
edges of each element. Although OASIS is capable of predicting IS
families, this functionality seems to be deprecated in the current ver—
sion of the software. Through comparisons across 1319 genomes to
a benchmark of ISFinder annotations, OASIS detected 37427 ISs
while IScan (Wagner et al., 2007) detected only 2902 ISs.

Software tools have also been developed to predict IS sequences
and families based on profile—sequence comparisons. These tools
employ Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) based on transposases of
characterized IS families. HMMs have been generated for transpo—
sases belonging to 19 characterized families of ISs in the PFAM
database (Finn et al., 2014). The Superfamily database of structural
and functional annotation of genomes currently hosts six HMM
profiles from domains belonging to two prokaryotic families of
transposases: mu bacteriophage transposase and IS200 (Gough and
Chothia, 2002). The Tinred web service provides profile HMMs
for the remaining IS families and improves on the accuracy of the
HMMs in the PFAM database (Riadi et al., 2012). Effective predic—
tion of ISs and Miniature Inverted repeat Transposable elements
(MITEs) using HMMs has been shown for 30 archaeal genomes
(Kamoun et al., 2013), demonstrating that HMM—based predictions
can augment BLAST—based sequence—sequence IS search methods to
improve accuracy and find novel ISs.

The current software tools described earlier operate only on
complete genomes with fully annotated ORFs. Complete genome as—
sembly of a single strain of bacteria can be time—consuming and
costly, and draft genomes or raw read sets are increasingly used for
comparative genomics studies of prokaryotes. Here, we present the
ISQuest tool for global investigation of ISs in unassembled or par—
tially assembled prokaryote genomes.

3 Methods

ISQuest is a computationally efficient algorithm designed to find
and annotate Insertion Sequences (IS) and transposases in fully
assembled, partially assembled or unassembled genomes. The algo—
rithm uses BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) to determine potential IS
locations by searching against an automatically curated database of
IS and transposase sequences derived from GenBank. The potential
locations are further extended by Smith—Waterman alignment exten—
sion. The IS elements may occur once in a genome (single—copy) or
may consist of a set of almost identical copies (multicopy). As there
are distinct levels of information available in each of these cases, dif—
ferent algorithms perform better with each class. As such, we have
designed ISQuest to find these two groups of ISs in two separate
steps: first finding multicopy ISs and then single—copy ISs. The over—
all schematic pipeline is shown in Figure 1. The pipeline has been
specially modeled to identify ISs but the algorithm is capable of de—
tecting other MGEs and the generic steps are described later with IS
elements as special cases.

‘transposase’, or ‘insertion sequence’ in the ‘product’ field of
GenBank files. The search keywords may be extended by user—pro—
vided regular expressions since there is a significant amount of in—
consistently annotated data in GenBank. For example, transposases
are frequently mis—annotated as integrases. Generating the database
of known MGEs is done once as a preprocessing step during the first
run of ISQuest which generates a BLAST database called
TransposaseDB. This database is stored for subsequent use by future
executions. The user can force updates of the database when new
versions of the GenBank files are available.

3.2 BLAST searching parameters

A candidate sequence for extension is determined by a BLAST
search against TransposaseDB. ISQuest can operate directly on raw
reads provided in FASTA/FASTQ format. Efficiency can be signifi—
cantly improved by assembling the reads and providing a set of
assembled contigs in FASTA format. This assembly can be per—
formed using an appropriate assembler for the input reads. The
assembled contigs are BLAST—searched against the TransposaseDB
database to find potential seed locations for ISs and transposases.
These seed locations represent all possible MGE locations that must
be searched and analyzed. Therefore, we use MegaBLAST for find—
ing matches with higher sequence similarity and better performance.
Because we further extend these seed sequences to find the bounda—
ries of the MGEs, we can tolerate partial or inexact matches.

3.3 Extending potential IS matches
Once the possible MGE seed locations have been identified, raw
reads are used to extend the seed sequences to determine boundaries.

The extension is done by pairwise alignment of the raw reads to the
ends of the seed sequence. This alignment algorithm is implemented
using BLAST allowing 5 bit score errors. This parameter is configur—
able by the user depending on the sequencing technology used and
the expected error profile of the reads. For Illumina reads we
allowed a bit score error of 5, which corresponds to 98% sequence
similarity using 250 bp reads.

The extension step aligns all reads to the end of a seed sequence
then executes the boundary detection step (next Section 3.4). The
extension step does not align reads that do not have at least a partial
overlap with the core seed sequence as we do not want to miss the
boundary of the MGE by large extensions. Therefore, each exten—
sion step builds no more than twice the input read length. The seed
sequence is expanded to include the aligned reads and the larger
consensus sequence is used as the new seed. Therefore, the extension
step is iteratively executed for the remaining sequences for which the
boundary cannot be found until the seed sequence becomes too
long. The termination length of the seed sequence is user configur—
able and defaults to 4 kb.

3.4 Determining IS boundary

We apply different approaches to find the boundary of single— and
multi—copy MGE elements. In the case of a single—copy, we can only
find the boundary in cases where there are ﬂanking inverted repeats.
To define the edges of single—copy ISs, we use an approach first de—
veloped by IScan to find IRs around the transposases, which are pre—
sent for the majority of ISs (Wagner et al., 2007). Brieﬂy, a Smith—
Waterman alignment, with a match score of 1, a mismatch penalty
of —3 and a gap penalty of —4, is performed comparing the region
upstream of the transposase (500 bp) with the reverse complement
of the downstream region (500 bp) and the highest match with a
score >10 is assumed to be the pair of terminal IRs.

Because the various copies of a multi—copy ISs are from different
genomic loci, they have different unique sequence beyond the boun—
daries of the IS. Therefore, if the consensus of the aligned reads dis—
agrees with the end of the seed sequence, this indicates that the
boundaries of the IS have been reached. Based on the number of pos—
sible disagreements we calculate the number of possible sequence
groups. If each group has coverage within a specified range we can
be certain that we have reached the final boundary for all the se—
quence groups and have run into the ﬂanking unique sequence.
However, if a sequence group has coverage several times that of the
expected coverage, we know that there exist longer MGEs the form
of tandem repeats which will require further extension. These se—
quence groups are separated out for extension in the next iteration.

The sequence groups with appropriate coverage are processed to
determine the IRs using a Smith—Waterman sequence alignment.
The alignment parameters are the same as those described for the
single—copy IS case. In some cases, the boundary defined by the IRs
may disagree with the boundary defined by the synteny of the
aligned reads due to nested repeats, ﬂanking direct repeats at the
ends, or inaccurate IR identification. ISQuest addresses this ambigu—
ity by prioritizing the IR edges and changing the boundary to match
the IRs. If IRs are found, a direct repeat finding subroutine attempts
to align 10 bp fragments on either side of the IRs to identify direct
repeats. If no IRs are found, the edges of the MGE are solely deter—
mined by the alignment of the reads. This allows annotation of par—
tial MGEs as many of these sequences do not have IRs. Thus, when
present in multiple copies, ISquest finds partial ISs; it is not capable
of finding these IS fragments when no intact copy with an annotated
transposase is present in GenBank.

The same MGE element may result in one or more BLAST seeds
and may cause redundant copies of the same IS to be generated.
Therefore, the redundant results within the final set are filtered out
using a pairwise global alignment to identify groups of IS lengths,
which are clustered together. The clustering algorithm groups se—
quences such that the mean lengths are within 100 bp of each other.
The cluster is then assumed to be the true copy size of the IS and any
fragments that are shorter than that threshold are classified as
partials.

3.5 Iterative extension and boundary finding

Sequences with known boundaries are removed from the extension
set and all remaining sequences are expanded based on the consen—
sus of the reads aligned to the boundaries. Extension and boundary
finding are performed iteratively until all seed sequences have been
processed. The end of each boundary finding step generates a new
set of seed sequences. The new seed sequences are generated from
the alignments that have no disagreement in the aligned reads, sig—
nifying that the boundary has not been reached. The consensus se—
quences generated from all these alignments is used as the fresh set
of seeds in the extension step. Some new seed sequences may be
derived from alignments with disagreements as well. In such cases
the alignment disagreements can be grouped such that some groups
have a very large coverage. The consensus sequences generated from
these large coverage groups are separated and treated as new seed
sequences.

3.6 ISQuest output

The output of the pipeline is a library of full and partial MGEs. IS
elements in particular are composed of a transposase with one or
more ORFs and appropriate upstream and downstream sequences.
The extreme edges are annotated in GenBank format for IS elements
and may include a partially conserved inverted repeat on each end
ranging from 8 to 40 bp in length with direct repeats ranging from 4
to 8 bp in length. Partial IS elements and other MGEs such as trans—
posases do not have special annotations defining the boundary.

The final output of ISQuest includes two files for the given input
of raw reads and contig(s): (i) a file in GenBank format listing each
MGE and its characteristics, including the chromosome ID, start
and end positions, direction, family and group, IRs (if found), DRs
(if found) and whether the element is a partial element; and (ii) a file
containing the copy number of each identified IS in .csv format.

3.7 Using the ISQuest tool

ISQuest is a free open source program implemented in C++. It is
available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/isquest. ISQuest requires
the read library of input reads in FASTA/FASTQ format and can be
optionally provided with an assembly of the reads. The program ac—
cepts four command line parameters (a) the configuration file, (b)
the raw reads, (c) the prefix of the output files and (d) the optional
set of assembled contigs. The configuration file contains the required
file paths to the local BLAST database and other configurable par—
ameters such as the maximum number of iterations ISQuest per—
forms, the maximum length of the MGEs to be built and the search
terms for MGE’s in GenBank. A complete wiki with required docu—
mentation is provided on the forge.

3.8 Preparation for ISQuest tool evaluation

To evaluate ISQuest we used 3810 microbial genomes and plasmid
sequences > 100 kb available in GenBank as of 15th October 2014.
The ART tool was used to generate synthetic Illumina paired—end

fragment libraries with read length of 250 bp and 50 X coverage.
The read length of 250 bp is typical of Illumina sequencing machines
and was selected for experimentation. ART simulates sequencing
reads by mimicking real sequencing process with empirical error
models or quality profiles summarized from large recalibrated
sequencing data. ART can also simulate reads using a user specified
error profile which requires the user to specify probability of
sequencing errors at each base position of the read. ART was used
as a primary tool for the simulation study of the 1000 Genomes
Project (Huang et al., 2012). ISQuest performance was evaluated by
first fragmenting each genome using the simulation process
described earlier. We then used the Celera WGS assembler to assem—
ble these simulated reads into contigs. The ISQuest algorithm was
operated on these contig sequences to generate a set of candidate
MGEs. This run can be performed using the raw reads but will sig—
nificantly slow down the execution. Also, we ensure that the
ISQuest testing algorithm does not include the genomes being pro—
cessed in the search database to ensure that the test and training sets
are disjoint.

4 Results

We performed two experiments to show the MGE detection capabil—
ity of ISQuest and present a summary of IS sequences found by
ISQuest classified by IS family. The performance of the ISQuest tool
was compared with that of OASIS using annotated transposases in
GenBank as a benchmark. This first experiment compared the ac—
curacy of ISQuest and OASIS by measuring the percentage of
GenBank annotated ISs found by each tool. Unlike ISQuest, OASIS
operates on completely assembled and annotated genomes and uses
only the annotation information available in the genome. ISQuest
operates on partially assembled contigs or directly on the raw reads
and does not require annotation to identify the ORFs. This experi—
ment shows the predictive capability of ISQuest to find ISs from a
draft and un—annotated assembly and compares it to the predictive
capability of OASIS using completely annotated sequences. The cap—
ability of ISQuest to find other repetitive elements (e.g. rRNA op—
erons) is not measured in this experiment.

As ISQuest uses an un—annotated draft genome, ORFs are not
clearly defined and finding the exact lengths of the MGEs is difficult
using the seed extension algorithm. Therefore, due to these inaccura—
cies, the testing result in Figure 2A considers 70% sequence length
match as a true positive; if ISQuest returns a sequence that matches

a 70% of the length of an annotated sequence in GenBank with
95% sequence similarity we consider it a true positive. The count
numbers in the figure represent IS counts in single—copy; multiple
copies of a particular IS are not included. Within the 3810 bench—
marked genomes and plasmids, ISQuest found 84.5% of the 9422
unique GenBank annotations, whereas OASIS found 58.9%. The
5346 GenBank ISs found both by ISQuest and OASIS represent in—
sertion sequences with well—defined inverted repeats. The 2558 se—
quences found by ISQuest and also present in GenBank are full and
partial transposase elements that do not contain completely defined
inverted repeats and therefore cannot be identified by OASIS. The
1350 annotations found only by ISQuest include partially assembled
insertion sequences and partial MGEs found by ISQuest that have
not been annotated in deposited genomes. These sequences may also
include potential sets of new insertion sequence and transposase
elements identified by ISQuest based on sequence similarity to other
ISs in GenBank. The intersection of ISQuest and OASIS is zero as
ISQuest cannot identify any sequence that has not been annotated in
more than one GenBank submission using the keywords ‘transpo—
sase’, or ‘insertion sequence’ in the ‘product’ field. ISQuest does not
take the annotated genome as input and therefore requires similar
annotation to be present in other submissions.

We further evaluated ISQuest under increasingly strict con—
straints by increasing the length match threshold which we accept as
a true positive to 80 and 90% of the sequence length (Fig. 2).
Figure 2B shows the results of considering only sequences with
greater than or equal to 80% length matches with 95 % sequence
similarity with GenBank sequences as valid true positives of
ISQuest. We notice a slight reduction in the number of insertion se—
quences detected by ISQuest to 82.2% of the 9422 unique GenBank
annotations. Increasing the length match threshold to 90% (Fig. 2C)
shows significant reduction in the number of insertion sequences de—
tected by ISQuest to 65.7%. However, this shows that ISQuest is
able to reproduce 90% of the actual IS sequence using the fast seed
extension algorithm in the majority of cases.

4.1 MGE detection using ISQuest

In order to study the overall sensitivity and specificity of ISQuest we
directly compared its output to GenBank. Comparison to OASIS is
problematic as OASIS only identifies insertion sequences with
clearly defined inverted repeats. ISQuest can identify full ISs, partial
ISs and other MGEs such as transposases. Table 1 shows the IS se—
quences found by ISQuest grouped by phylum. The numbers in the

Fig. 2. Venn diagram illustrating the number of IS annotations identified by ISQuest and OASIS compared with GenBank at three length match thresholds. (A)
ISQuest and OASIS both found a total of 5409 185 (in single copies) in the 3810 GenBank benchmarked genomes and plasmids. Additionally, ISQuest identified
2558 185 that OASIS did not annotate and OASIS found 148 185 that ISQuest failed to detect. OASIS found 67 insertion sequences that were not correctly anno-
tated in GenBank as IS. ISQuest generated 1350 partial IS sequences that have not been annotated in GenBank. The intersection of ISQuest and OASIS is 0 as
ISQuest cannot identify any sequence that has not been annotated in more than one GenBank submission using the keywords ‘transposase', or ‘insertion se-
quence' in the ‘product' field. ISQuest does not take the annotated genome as input and therefore requires similar annotation to be present in other submissions.

table represent ISs in multiple copies, i.e. the multiple copies of the
IS are included (collapsed). Likely because of the number of
sequenced genomes from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, >50% of
the ISs we found are from Proteobacteria and an additional ~16%
are from Firmicutes (Table 1, Column 3). ISQuest detected 82.2%
of the Proteobacteria ISs and 81.1% on average from GenBank
(Table 1, column 3, 5). The prediction capability of ISQuest is lim—
ited by the assumption that a similar annotation of the IS element is
present in other genomes. So, in some cases we cannot identify cer—
tain ISs correctly due to sequence divergence or absence of annota—
tion. Also, the copy number computation based on the number of
possible flanking unique sequence regions is conservative in estimat—
ing the number of copies and reduces the copy count to the least pos—
sible value.

ISQuest was also used to identify transposase elements and the
sequences generated by ISQuest without clearly defined inverted re—
peats were compared with transposase annotations in GenBank.
Similar to IS elements, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes account for
majority of the transposase annotation is GenBank (52.3 and
18.3%, respectively). ISQuest detected 57.7% of the Proteobacteria
transposases and 44.4% of transposases from GenBank (Table 1,
column 4, 6). The significantly lower detection accuracy relative to
ISs is due to the presence of single—copy transposases. These elements
do not possess inverted repeats, and in single—copy cases, do not

possess multiple unique ﬂanking sequences; therefore, their length
cannot be estimated by ISQuest. Such single—copy elements with no
discernable end regions are extended to the default maximum length
and often include unique sequence that does not match an existing
transposase element from GenBank.

4.2 IS Family detection using ISQuest

It was also interesting to study the performance of ISQuest in terms
of the IS families discovered. This provided insight into the annota—
tions and predictive capability of ISQuest for mining ISs from fami—
lies with high divergence. Table 2 shows the top 20 IS families
detected, some of which are predicted better than others due to the
inherent divergence in the IS families and inaccurate annotations
from GenBank. IS4 family is the most annotated IS family in
GenBank with a total of 5521 annotations. ISQuest identified the IS
elements in IS4 family with N 60% accuracy which is significantly
less that overall accuracy of ISQuest. This is due to the high internal
divergence of IS4 elements which makes classification and identifica—
tion challenging.

Overall, a total of 60 502 MGE elements representing 9317
unique IS sets and 26 767 transposase annotations were identified
by ISQuest in 3810 genomes and plasmids. ISQuest took a total of
23 h and 44 min to annotate all 3810 genomes on a 4x Intel Xenon

5 Conclusion and future work

As sequencing technology progresses, the need for user—friendly,
high—throughput annotation systems continues to grow. We de—
veloped ISQuest, an automated annotation system for insertion se—
quences, which is capable not only of providing detailed IS
information for a single genome, but also of processing thousands of
genomes within a few hours. The major feature implemented in
ISQuest is the capability of detecting ISs and other MGEs using par—
tially assembled sequences or even raw reads. This makes ISQuest a
more usable tool over previous such implementations which require
a fully assembled and annotated genome. The design of ISQuest can
also identify various types of MGEs other than ISs and therefore can
be used for many purposes, such as mapping the evolutionary his—
tory and analyzing horizontal gene transfer patterns.

We tested ISQuest on simulated read libraries of 3810 complete
bacterial genomes and plasmids in GenBank. Of 101 954 IS and
transposable elements annotated for these sequences in GenBank,
we identified 82 with 80% sequence length match. ISQuest is cap—
able of identifying a large number of MGE elements from unas—
sembled genomes with acceptable sequence accuracy to be used in
comparative genomics and assembly verification. ISQuest can be
used for many purposes, such as mapping the evolutionary history,
comparing IS structure among divergent strains and horizontal gene
transfer patterns of different ISs. The ISQuest tool can also have
interesting application is metagenomics analysis. Therefore, the fu—
ture versions of ISQuest tool will be extended to handle metage—
nomic datasets and tested with metagenomic raw reads.

ImgLib2

 

ImageJ is provided by non—copying wrappers of ImageJ data
structures as ImgLib2 accessibles and vice versa. This makes it
straightforward to integrate ImgLib2 into existing ImageJ—based
processing pipelines. Light—weight wrappers for other data
models are easy to implement and currently exist for Java
AWT Buﬂeredlmage, Java primitive type arrays and remotely
stored image stacks (Saalfeld et al., 2009). ImgLib2 comprises
a growing collection of generic algorithms that are fundamental
building blocks for n—dimensional image analysis: the Fast
Fourier Transform can be used for tomography reconstruction,
pattern detection or (de—)convolution; sub—pixel edge detection
(Devernay, 1995), component trees (Nister and Stewenius,
2008) and automatically detected interest—points (e.g. DoG and
MSER; Lindeberg, 1998; Matas et al., 2002) are important tools
for image segmentation, image registration and tracking; k—d
trees enable fast n—dimensional search.

Sparsely and irregularly sampled data are supported, stored
either as a sample list or in a k—d tree. Both implement interfaces
for nearest—neighbor search, allowing extrapolation of sparse
data into a continuous image. Sparsely sampled data, interpol—
ation, extension, coordinate transformation and several algo—
rithms are illustrated in Figure 1.

4 DISCUSSION

ImgLib2 is an open—source image processing framework that
increases code re—usability by promoting generic implementa—
tions. It provides an abstraction layer that focuses on ﬂexible
and efﬁcient image storage and access. The core paradigm is a
clean separation of pixel algebra (how sample values are manipu—
lated), data access (how sample coordinates are traversed) and
data representation (how the samples are stored, laid out in
memory or paged to disc). ImgLib2 relies on virtual access to
both sample values and coordinates, facilitating parallelizability
and extensibility.

ImgLib2 aims to connect software projects through an inter—
face design that is easily adapted to existing data structures.
ImgLib2 is the first image processing library available for Java
that combines a ﬂexible high—level programming interface with
optimal performance. It enables developers of bioimage analysis
software to focus on the design of complex algorithms instead of
data management. Conversely, software engineers can develop
efﬁcient infrastructure without interfering with algorithm design.
This becomes particularly interesting in the emerging ﬁeld of
bioimage informatics that is coping with the enormous amount
of n—dimensional image data generated by recent developments in

microscopy. Consequently, ImgLib2 is already being used by
several high—profile projects of the Java bioimaging community
(Berthold et al., 2009; Rueden et al., 2010; Schindelin et al.,
2012). It is easily integrated into other projects providing an
ideal basis for sharing interoperable, generic algorithms.

Abstract

Motivation: We propose the third—order model equation of the Jeffreys type for concentrations
of gap gene proteins in order to take into account particle inertia. Gap genes are responsible for for—
mation of body segments in Drosophila melanogaster embryo during its early development.
Usually the expression ofthe genes is described by the model of protein transport based on con—
ventional diffusion equation. However, the model is known to govern the Brownian (non—inertial)
motion of particles; hence, it is hardly applicable to the description of protein transport.

Results: Analysis of the Jeffreys—type equation results in the necessary condition for the problem
to be well—posed. Application of the Jeffreys—type equation with non—linear terms to description
of the dynamics of gap gene network demonstrates better fitting to experimental data than the

 

conventional model.

1 Introduction

Segmentation genes play crucial role in early development of
DrosoleiIa I'nelanogaster, being responsible for formation and
positioning of body segments (Nusslein—Volhard and Wieschaus,
1980). The segmentation genes are divided into four classes: ma-
ternal genes, gap genes, pair-rule genes and segment polarity gen-

 

es according to their mutant phenotype (for details, see
Nusslein—Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980). At present, gap genes
have become popular investigation object, in particular, for sys-
tem biologists due to the following reasons (Jaeger, 2011). First,
the gap gene system is the most upstream regulatory layer among
zygotic genes, controlling D. melanogaster embryogenesis and
determining both the position and the identities of body seg-
ments. Second, availability of big amount of experimental data
on gene expression enable to model mathematically and

reconstruct the gap gene network in silico (Gursky et al. 2008;
Jaeger et a1. 2004; Reinitz et a1. 1995).

Usually the gene expression is described by means of con-
ventional model based on the parabolic reaction diffusion equation,
written for an unknown protein concentration function ulx, If) as:

Hy :Duxx+R(x.t.u(x.t)). (1.1)

where x is space coordinate, t is time, D is the diffusion coefficient
and R(x. 2f. u(x. t)) is a reaction term representing protein production
and its degradation.

Equation (1.1) was proposed in (Mjolsness et a1. 1991) for de-
scription of the dynamics of internal state of nuclei in blastoderm of
D. melanogaster embryo and originally contained the diffusion term
in discrete form. The model took into account three major processes
essential for embryo development: synthesis of proteins, their

diffusion between nuclei and degradation. The same approach was
used in (Driever and Nusslein—Volhard, 1988) to explain the dy—
namics of the Bicoid maternal protein in D. melanogaster embryo. It
is known as the synthesis—diffusion—degradation model (Gregor
et al., 2007). The model equation (1.1) with diffusion term in con—
tinuous or in discrete form have been widely used in the last two
decades for description of diffusive transport of proteins, e.g., syn—
thesized by maternal gene bicoia’ or gap genes in D. melanogaster
embryo blastoderm during early embryogenesis (Drocco et al.,
2012; Gregor et al., 2005; Gursky et al., 2004; Mjolsness et al.,
1991; Reinitz et al., 1995).

However, (1.1) has a crucial drawback: it is based on the phe—
nomenological Fick law for mass flux, which was formulated
for Brownian motion of non—inertial particles, and, therefore, it
is applicable only for description of light particles motion, for
example, in an ideal gas. Proteins are heavy complex organic
molecules, and for this reason, the classical approach is hardly
applicable for modelling of protein transfer.

Mathematically, non—inertial description of inertial particle
transport leads to an infinite velocity of disturbances propagation
defined by (1.1). For example, when R(x,t) E 0 and with initial
condition u(x. 0) : 5(x), where 5(x) is the Dirac delta function, the
fundamental solution to (1.1) has the form:

u(x. t) : (1/\/2Ttt> exp (—x2/4Dt), (1.2)

and it is positive for any finite values of x, therefore a sudden change
of a substance concentration somewhere will immediately transfer
to any arbitrary point. The profile of (1.2) at certain time moment is
shown in Figure 1a (see, e.g. Masoliver and Weiss, 1996; Sobolev,
1997; Weiss, 2002), and we call this phenomenon of an infinite
velocity as ‘the diffusion paradox” for brevity. Immediate disturb—
ances propagation contradicts with experiments, in which proteins
move in an embryo very slow, with the velocities about 1—5 um/s
(see Gregor et al., 2005, 2007).

In 1948, Cattaneo proposed the telegraph equation, containing
additional ‘relaxation time’ and, therefore, free from the diffusion
paradox, to model mass (heat) transfer. The fundamental solution
to the equation describes propagation of disturbances with finite
velocity, but due to the wave—like behaviour it may reach negative
values inappropriate from biological viewpoint. Furthermore, the
fundamental solution to the telegraph equation with the Dirac delta
function as an initial condition contains two discontinuous wave
fronts, propagating in opposite directions.

In 1989, Joseph and Preziosi proposed the description of heat
transfer based on the refined model for flux of rheological fluid in
the Earth crust introduced in 1929 by H. Jeffreys. Similarly, one can

Preziosi, 1989b)

 

obtain an equation for determination of mass transfer via elimin—
ation of the flux function from the mass balance equation:

u,(x.t) : —]x(x. t) + R(x.t.u(x. t)). (1.3)
and the Jeffreys refined formula for flux:
[(x. t) + t],(x. t) : —(D + D1) ux(x, t) — r Dlux,(x, t). (1.4)
The resulting Jeffreys—type equation:
114,, + u, — rD1 um, : (D + D1) uxx + R(x. t) + tR,(x. t). (1.5)

contains two additional parameters, as compared with (1.1), namely,
the relaxation time ‘5 and the second diffusion coefficient D1, thus
taking into account the particle inertia. The particular solution to (1.5)
at certain time moment under the assumptions R(x. t) : 0. u(x. 0)
: 6(x), u,(x, 0) : 0 is shown in Figure 1b. It can be seen that a small
amount of particles occurs at infinity, and the diffusion paradox for
the Dirac delta function as an initial condition is not completely elimi—
nated by the proposed model. However, even in this case the Jeffreys—
type equation describes formation of a smooth wave front from an ini—
tial sharp discontinuity, that is always positive, and its propagation
with finite velocity. Applications of the Jeffreys—type equation to differ—
ent physical problems can be found in (Joseph and Preziosi 1989a,b;
Rukolaine and Samsonov, 2013; Sobolev, 1997).

Due to similarity between heat and mass transfer both the tele—
graph equation and the Jeffreys—type equation are of interest for de—
scription of protein transport in biological systems. Nevertheless, the
maternal and gap genes expression in D. melanogaster embryo is often
modelled by means of the parabolic reaction diffusion equation, which
limited applicability has been widely discussed (see Fort and Mendez,
2002; Masoliver and Weiss, 1996). The conventional model is still
popular due to simplicity and similarity at large time scales of the fun—
damental solutions to all parabolic, the telegraph and the Jeffreys—type
equations, as shown in Rukolaine and Samsonov, (2013).

In this article, we apply the mathematical model consisting of the
coupled Jeffreys—type equations with non—linear reaction terms to
study the dynamics of protein concentrations in gene network of four
gap genes. The equations are solved numerically, and the results will
be compared with experimental data and with numerical solution to
the model based on the conventional diffusion Equation (1.1).

2 Methods

2.1 Model problem of dynamics of protein
concentration

Consider the model problem of finding the distribution of pro—
teins in an embryo, when maternal gene protein behaviour is
described. According to the simplest model (Gregor et al., 2005;
Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002), a protein of the maternal gene
bicoia’ (bca') diffuses through an embryo and decays uniformly with
constant rate y, therefore the reaction term R(x, t) in (1.5) can be
written as —yu(x. t). The embryo is assumed to have no mass
exchange with an external environment. The protein is synthesized
at the point source located near the anterior pole of an embryo, and
the production rate is assumed to be constant in time (Gregor et al.,
2005, 2008), that leads to the boundary conditions:

(MW) ' nin(x))lx:o = q. (J(x7 t) ' nin(x))lx:L = 07 (241)

where n,” is the internal normal, q is the source intensity. Initial
conditions are specified in general form:

“(xtt)lt:0 = (P(x)7ut(x7 t)lt:0 2 INC) (212)

Taking into account the continuity of](x, t) in [0. L] X [0. T] and
constant flux at the domain boundary, the equation for flux, written
for x : 0 and x : L, leads to the differential equations for functions
uxlx:0 and uxlx:L, respectively, which depend on t. Initial conditions
of the Neumann type for both equations can be obtained from
(2.1.2) in a form:

— D
mm : (px(L)exp< t 2), D2 E D + D1. (2.1.4)
‘ED1
We rewrite (1.5), now containing R(x, t,u(x,t)) : —yu(x, t), in
the form:
ﬂu — ﬂu : 0, (x,t) E [0;L] X [0; T], (2.1.5)

where 53 : 88;; + (9; + 58“; — 018,0; is the differential operator of the
problem, the equation coefficients are e : 17X, 6 : —1: Ba,
06 = (D + Dar, l3 = —vx and x E 1/(1 + V?)

The Fourier method leads to the exact solution to the problem:

u(x.t) : w(x.t) + fcos (nkx/L)Sk(t). (2.1.6)
12:0

where w(x, t) is an auxiliary function, and both w(x, t) and Sk(t) are
defined in Supplementary notes, available online.

2.2 Analysis of initial conditions

Integrating (1.3) with R(x. t. u(x. t)) : —yu(x. t) and boundary
conditions (2.1.1) over [0; L] and applying the Laplace transform,
we obtain the following equation for the Laplace image i:

L q L
(p + *0] E (x.p) dx : — J (p(x) dx. (2.2.1)

o P 0
After the Laplace transform of the Jeffreys—type equation (2.2.1)
and integration of it with (2.1.3), (2.1.4) and (2.1.1), we obtain the

following integral condition:

L L
J 1p(x)dx : q — y] (p(x) dx. (2.2.2)
o 0
which means that in general the function Mac) cannot be equal to
zero within [0; L], since (2.2.2) may not be valid. There is a different
way to obtain (2.2.2) by integration of (1.3) over [0; L], assuming
t: 0 and substituting the initial conditions (2.1.2). Therefore,
(2.2.2) implies the mass conservation at the initial time moment.

2.3 Model for dynamics of gap gene proteins
concentration

To define the reaction term R(x. t.u(x. t)) in (1.5) a synthesis func—
tion g(11(x. t)) was introduced (see Mjolsness et al., 1991), which
takes into account that upstream segmentation genes (e.g. maternal
genes) regulates the expression of downstream genes (e.g. gap genes)
and interactions between the gap genes in the gene network.
Furthermore, the gap genes are supposed to degrade uniformly with
constant rate, that leads to R(x.t.u(x.t)) : —yu(x. t) +g(n(x.t)),
and therefore (1.5 ) can be written as:

531406; t) - 131406; t) = xg('1(x;t)) + 8g;(11(x; t)) (231)

Therefore, the dynamics of protein concentrations in the gene net—
work consisting of four gap genes is described formally by means of

the Jeffreys—type equations together with boundary conditions and
initial conditions:

coupled via the non—linear terms g(i)(-), which determine synthesis
of protein 1' and depend on 11“), representing a contribution of all fac—
tors to regulation of gene 1' expression. The gene reaction on regula—
tors influence has the threshold behaviour, therefore the synthesis
function is assumed to be proportional to the ‘signoid’ curve, and its
argument contains the additive contributions of all regulatory factors:

where the constant GU) denotes the maximum intensity level of
gene 1' protein synthesis, the matrix coefficients Ti" characterize
the level and type of regulation of gene 1' protein by other gap
genes, Eik are the coefficients of regulation by maternal genes,
which concentrations denoted as Uk, and 1‘“) denotes the contribu—
tion by external factors, that is assumed to be homogeneous in
space and time. The function g(11(x. t)) is widely used in gap
genes expression modelling (see, e.g. Gursky et al., 2004, 2008;
Jaeger et al., 2004; Kozlov et al., 2012; Mjolsness et al., 1991;
Reinitz et al., 1995).

For numerical simulation, the initial protein concentrations data
were taken from the database FlyEx (FlyEx: Electronic database on
segmentation genes expression in Drosoplaila; http://urchin.spbcas.
ru/flyex, http://flyex.ams.sunysb.edu/FlyEx), containing experimen—
tal data for concentrations of the Drosoplaila gap gene proteins at
different stages of development.

Analysis of initial conditions for (2.3.1) is similar to that for
(2.1.5). The boundary conditions on ](x, t) are homogeneous, since
gap genes are expressed inside an embryo, but not at the boundaries.
Taking into account the condition:

L

one can guarantee the problem (2.3.2) to be well—posed.

2.4 Implementation of numerical simulation method

The system (2.1.2) was solved numerically using the explicit finite
difference method in spatial domain (0; 100%) of an embryo length
(EL) from t: 0 up to 68th minute of development. We used the cen—
tral difference approximation for u,” and the backward difference

EL with boundary conditions of the Dirichlet type. The lowest
RMS : 7.317 demonstrates substantially better fit to experimental
data in comparison to the Neumann boundary conditions, therefore
we conclude that the Dirichlet boundary conditions provide better
results for modelling the gap genes expression than the conditions of
the Neumann type. The values of the regulation matrix coefficients,
presented in Table 1, are also in good agreement with experiments
and with results for conventional model, as well as for the model
with the Neumann boundary conditions.

From the graphs in Figure 3 it can be seen that the modelled con—
centration profiles are similar to those for the model with the
Neumann boundary conditions in Figure 2. Nevertheless is should
be noted that the usage of the Dirichlet boundary conditions allows
us to predict the expression of all genes very close to the experimen—
tal data near the computational domain boundaries for both geno—
types. However, the narrower expression domain of Gt protein,
its sharp maximum and the shifted hh expression maximum in Kr’
mutant require further study.

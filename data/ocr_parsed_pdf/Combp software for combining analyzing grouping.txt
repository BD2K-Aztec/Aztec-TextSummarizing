Comb-p

 

probes generating the P—values are unevenly spaced, as is
common with methylation arrays.

Once the ACF has been calculated, it can be used to perform
the StoufferiLiptakiKechris correction (51k) where each P—value
is adjusted according to adjacent P—values as weighted according
to the ACF. The resulting BED ﬁle has an additional column
containing the corrected P—value. A given P—value will be pulled
lower if its neighbors also have low P—values (and little
auto—correlation) and likely remain insigniﬁcant if the neighbor—
ing P—values are also high.

A q—value score based on the BenjaminiiHochberg false dis—
covery (FDR) correction or on a null model from shufﬂed data
may then be calculated. The peak—ﬁnding algorithm can then be
used to ﬁnd enrichment regions or peaks on the FDR q—value,
the slk—corrected P—value or on the original P—value.

Once the regions are identiﬁed, a P—value for each region can
be assigned using the StoufferiLiptak correction. Note that the
ﬁrst ACF calculated above was only out to the distance speciﬁed
and may not extend far enough to cover the longer regions.
Therefore, this step ﬁrst calculates the ACF out to a distance
equal to the length of the longest region. The corrected P—value
for each region is then calculated using the original P—values that
fall within the peak and the full ACF. Because we use the ori—
ginal, uncorrected P—values in the calculation of significance for
the peak, we side—step issues of altering the distribution in both
the 51k and FDR steps. The region _p program reports the slk—
corrected P—value and a one—step sidak (1967) multiple—testing
correction. For a given region, the number of possible tests in the
gidak correction is the total bases covered by all input probes
divided by the size of the given region. In short, we define the
extents of the region using the FDR q—values, then we deﬁne the
significance of the regions using the SLK correction of the ori—
ginal P—values.

comb—p is implemented as a single command—line applica—
tion that dispatches to multiple independent sub—modules
and as a set of python packages that may be used progra—
matically. Where possible, computationally intensive algorithms
are parallelized automaticallyifor the ACF and the 51k steps in
the analyses described belowithis results in a speed—up that is
nearly linear with the number of cores available. The implemen—
tation has been tuned to minimize memory use and computation
time.

When run without arguments, the comb—p executable displays
the available programs and a short description of each. Although
each of these tools may be used independently, the progression of
acf, Slk, fdr, peaks, region _p works well for the examples pre—
sented. These steps can be run successively with the single com—
mand: pipeline.

4 APPLICATION

We extend three previously published analyses to demon—
strate the utility and breadth of use of comb—p and to validate
against the published data. The full set of commands used to
run each of these analyses is available in the corresponding sub—
directory at: https://github.com/brentp/combined—pvalues/tree/
master/examples.

Comprehensive, high—throughput array for relative methyla—
tion is a tiling array used to quantify methylation at CpG—rich

sites (Irizarry et al., 2008). Adjacent probes are correlated due to
the regional nature of methylation and to the overlapping probes
on the tiling array. The CHARM study reported in Irizarry et a].
(2009) contains probe data for tumor and normal samples from a
variety of tissues. Using these data, we fit a linear model in R
(http://www.R—project.org) to obtain P—values for the signiﬁ—
cance of tumor or tissue—speciﬁc effects on methylation status
at each probe. We then run comb—p, which ﬁnds 85% of the
tumor—speciﬁc differentially methylated regions (C—DMRs) re—
ported by Irizarry et a]. (2009) and 75% of the tissue—specific
T—DMRs reported. While these overlaps depend on the param—
eter choice, we show that the Irizarry DMRs that overlap with
the comb—p DMRs have signiﬁcantly (t—test, P: 1.296e—145)
lower FDR values (as reported by Irizarry) than those that do
not, indicating that comb—p is reporting the best regions. We also
show that our method yields only 39 false—positive DMRs on 20
runs of shufﬂed of CHARM data (33 of those come from two of
the sets, because those shufﬂes of the clinical data happen to
coincide well with the casewontrol status of the original data).
This gives a FDR rate of 0.0008 for reasonable cutoffs. We
found that comb—p recovers more significant probes than a
simple FDR correction on the original P—values. We also
found that the process of segmenting the genome into smaller
chunks and calling regions independently in each chunk gener—
ates similar regions to those derived using the auto—correlation
structure for the entire genome (the default).

DamID technology followed by tiling arrays can be used to
map genomic regions bound by DNA—binding proteins (van
Steensel et al., 2001). We recreate an analysis of the DamID
tiling array data for the Ci transcription factor in Drosophila
melanogaster (Biehs et al., 2010). Kechris et a]. (2010) calculated
the mean log ratios of intensities between Ci experimental and
control samples to obtain P—values from a one—sided moderated
t—test. Of the original 878 regions, 695 (79%) are represented in
the comb—p predicted peaks. To score each peak, the authors
report —log10 of the smallest raw P—value for each peak. The
published peaks overlapping the comb-p regions have a higher
score than those that do not (t—test, P=2.98e—59), indicating
that comb—p is ﬁnding the best regions among those previously
reported. In addition, comb—p regions also yield a higher target
enrichment score based on proximity to known Ci genes, indicat—
ing that comb—p is selecting for known targets. The corrected
P—value reported by comb-p can be used as a ﬁlter to extract
regions of interest; we calculated the enrichment ratio of the
number of observed to expected Ci target genes at various
comb—p—corrected P—value cutoffs. For a cutoff of 0. 1, the enrich—
ment is 2.41, this enrichment increases to 3.46 and 5.29 for more
stringent cutoffs of 1e—3 and 1e—4, respectively.

Bisulﬁte—sequencing (BS—Seq) is also used to measure methy—
lation across the genome. As another example of the ﬂexibility of
our method, we demonstrate a possible analysis on data
described in Hsieh et a]. (2009) from Arabidopsis thaliana using
Methleoder (Pedersen et al., 2011) to map the bisulﬁte—treated
reads to the genome. At each site, we use Fisher’s exact test to
obtain P—values for the counts of converted and un—converted
cytosines between endosperm and embryo. We ﬁnd DMRs be—
tween these two tissues associated with genes enriched for gene
ontologies related to the ribosome (P: 1e—3).

5 CONCLUSON

The comb—p software is useful in contexts where auto—correlated
P—values are generated across the genome. We have outlined our
implementation and demonstrated the utility on data from three
different technologies each from a different statistical test. We
have also validated our method using previously published re—
sults from those studies. Future work could extend this frame—
work to address applications with a more segmented structure
such as DNA copy number and ChIP—seq. Currently, we recom—
mend the use of comb-p for technologies with a more regular
autocorrelation structure. In addition, we note that this
method will have a sensitivity and speciﬁcity that will depend
on each dataset and we recommend that users explore these
tradeoffs on shufﬂed versions of their own data as demonstrated
in the CHARM example.

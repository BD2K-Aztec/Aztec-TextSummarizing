Abstract

Motivation: Photoactivatable ribonucleoside—enhanced cross—linking and immunoprecipitation
(PAR—CLIP) is an experimental method based on next—generation sequencing for identifying the
RNA interaction sites of a given protein. The method deliberately inserts T—to—C substitutions at the
RNA—protein interaction sites, which provides a second layer of evidence compared with other
CLIP methods. However, the experiment includes several sources of noise which cause both low—
frequency errors and spurious high—frequency alterations. Therefore, rigorous statistical analysis is
required in order to separate true T—to—C base changes, following cross—linking, from noise. So far,
most of the existing PAR—CLIP data analysis methods focus on discarding the low—frequency errors
and rely on high—frequency substitutions to report binding sites, not taking into account the possi—
bility of high—frequency false positive substitutions.

Results: Here, we introduce BMix, a new probabilistic method which explicitly accounts for the
sources of noise in PAR—CLIP data and distinguishes cross—link induced T—to—C substitutions from
low and high—frequency erroneous alterations. We demonstrate the superior speed and accuracy
of our method compared with existing approaches on both simulated and real, publicly available
human datasets.

Availability and implementation: The model is freely accessible within the BMix toolbox at www.

RNA molecules interact with proteins and form ribonucleoprotein
complexes actively involved in a plethora of essential biological
processes such as translational regulation, alternative splicing or
RNA transport (Lunde et (11., 2007; Muller—McNicoll et (11., 2013).
A well—known example of RNA—binding proteins (RBPs) consists of
members of the Argonaute family, components of the RNA—induced
silencing complex (RISC), which bind to diverse small RNA mol—
ecules and regulate gene silencing (Meister, 2013). Gerstberger et al.

found dysregulated in diseases including cancer (Kechavarzi et (11.,
2014). Therefore, characterizing the interactions between RNA and
RBPs represents an important step towards understanding RNA
function.

High—throughput sequencing technology allows querying
the binding sites of a specific RBP in a transcriptome—wide
fashion (Blencowe et (11., 2009; Kloetgen et (11., 2014). One of the re—
cently developed high—throughput sequencing—based experimental

protocols aiming to identify the binding sites of RBPs throughout
the transcriptome is Photo—Activatable Ribonucleoside—enhanced
Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation (PAR—CLIP) (Hafner et (11.,
2010). According to this method (Fig. 1A), a synthetic photoactivat—
able ribonucleoside such as 4SU (4—thiouridine) or, less commonly,
6SG (6—thioguanosine) is integrated into the RNA of cultured cells.
Upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, cross—linking of RBPs to
RNA occurs. The cross—linked RNA—RBP pairs are subsequently iso—
lated using immunoprecipitation with an antibody targeting the pro—
tein of interest, and the RNA fragment is retrieved upon protein
digestion. A complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing library is
generated by reverse complementing the RNA fragments. Due to the
incorporated nucleoside, systematic T—to—C (for 43 U) or G—to—A (for
63 G) substitutions appear in the cDNA library at the interaction sites
(Hafner et (11., 2010). Therefore, PAR—CLIP brings the advantage of
having an additional layer of evidence by introducing specific base
changes at the binding sites.

PAR—CLIP data are characterized by prevalent T—to—C substitu—
tions observed at different mismatch frequencies (Hafner et (11.,
2010). However, compared with RNA—Seq, PAR—CLIP has been
observed to also introduce a large number of other substitutions, dif—
ferent from T—to—C, notably at low and high mismatch frequency
(see Section 3). This indicates the presence of noise and contamin—
ation in the PAR—CLIP procedure which can as well introduce erro—
neous T—to—C substitutions, with high potential to be mistaken for
true cross—link alterations. Therefore, of great importance in PAR—
CLIP data analysis is discarding the low—frequency sequencing
errors, as well as high—frequency spurious substitutions.

Currently, there is a handful of methods available for analyzing
PAR—CLIP data, trying to identify the RNA—RBP—binding sites using
various techniques, such as kernel density estimation (Corcoran et
(11., 2011), non—parametric mixture models (Sievers et (11., 2012;
Comoglio et (11., 2015), Bayesian hidden Markov models (Yun et (11.,
2014) and binomial tests (Chen et (11., 2014). Some of the available
methods focus on analyzing data from one specific type of RBP,
such as, e.g. AGOZ PAR—CLIP data (Erhard et (11., 2013). However,
the non—cross—link, high—frequency substitutions are usually reported

within high—confidence—binding sites by most of these methods. To
the best of our knowledge, only one of the currently existing PAR—
CLIP analysis methods, namely WavClusteR (Sievers et (11., 2012;
Comoglio et (11., 2015), accounts for these substitutions. Sievers et
al. (2012) show that cross—link loci reside in moderately altered sites
and, within the WavClusteR package, use a mixture model based on
the relative substitution frequencies to exclude sites with too low or
high nucleotide substitution rates. However, the method is not
widely used due to complex implementation and long execution
time. Additionally, the approach underlying the WavClusteR pack—
age does not explicitly model read counts within the genome and
eventually uses a fixed cutoff of the substitution frequencies to select
high—confidence T—to—C alterations, which leads to a higher error
rate, especially in low—coverage regions. Here, we present a novel
probabilistic approach, based on a constrained three—component bi—
nomial mixture, to explicitly describe substitution counts observed
in PAR—CLIP data. The method, coined BMix, uses a maximum like—
lihood approach to estimate the substitution rates induced by PAR—
CLIP and separates both low— and high—frequency erroneous T—to—C
alterations from the true cross—link substitutions (Fig. 1B). We per—
form an exhaustive comparison of BMix to existing approaches and
show its increased performance in terms of speed, accuracy and con—
sistency on synthetic and real data.

2 Methods

2.1 Data preprocessing

PAR—CLIP and RNA—Seq reads were clipped from their adapter
using the fastx clipper tool (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu) and
only reads larger than 13 nucleotides were kept for further analysis.
PCR duplicates were included in the analysis by all the tested meth—
ods. The reads were aligned to the human reference genome assem—
bly hg19 with the bowtie alignment tool version 0.12.9 (Langmead
et (11., 2009). The same parameters employed by PARalyzer and
WavClusteR were used, —n l — —best —m 100 —k l —l 50 (1
allowed mismatch, only one best alignment is reported, at most 100
allowed alignments per read, and seed length of 50, respectively).

2.2 Probabilistic modeling of substitution counts

The data consist of PAR—CLIP cDNA sequencing reads. After align—
ment to the reference genome, at each position in an aligned read,
the observed nucleotide can either match or differ from the refer—
ence. When the nucleotide differs from the reference, several causes
are possible. First, the observed nucleotide could be a sequence vari—
ant, caused by single—nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), or foreign,
non—cross—linked RNA fragments mapped to a reference location
highly similar to their sequence (contamination). Second, if the refer—
ence is T and the corresponding read nucleotide is C, then a cross—
link—induced substitution could have occurred. Third, a mismatch
could have also happened due to sequencing error. These three
events are not mutually exclusive.

In order to detect RNA—protein cross—link—induced T—to—C substi—
tutions, we model, for each position i in the genome, where the
reference, ri, is different from C, the probability of the observed
T—to—C, A—to—C or G—to—C substitution. We define xi as the sequenc—
ing coverage at position i, and y, as the number of times the refer—
ence nucleotide is substituted with C in all the reads covering
position i. We assume that the observed T—to—C alterations are due
to (i) sequencing error, (ii) SNPs or contamination or (iii) PAR—CLIP
cross—link—based substitution, whereas the observed A—to—C and G—
to—C substitutions are assumed to originate only from (i) sequencing
error, or (ii) SNPs or contamination. We ignore the cases of photo—
activated sequence variants (i.e. where the reference is A, or G,
while the sequence variant is T, and is substituted to C due to photo—
activation by PAR—CLIP). With this simplification, we introduce the
latent random variable z,- E {1, 2, 3} corresponding to the three pos—
sible reasons (i) to (iii) that can explain the observed nucleotide at
locus i on the genome. Specifically, for reference T positions, zi : 1
refers to background, zi :2 corresponds to a sequence variant and
z, : 3 refers to an RNA—RBP cross—link. For reference A or G pos—
itions, only z, : 1 and z, : 2 are possible.

We define e as the probability of inducing a substitution due to
sequencing noise. This probability accounts for all the modeled nu—
cleotide substitutions (i.e. T—to—C, A—to—C, G—to—C, C—to—T, C—to—A
and C—to—G), and is expected to be low. Consequently, at back—
ground positions (z, : 1), the probability of occurrence of a specific
substitution is e. In the case of sequence variant loci (z, : 2), where
one can assume that the aligned reads originate from a genomic se—
quence which differs from the reference genome at the sequence
variant locus (Supplementary Fig. S1), we expect the aligned reads
to contain either the nucleotide from the sequence of origin (which
is different from the reference), or transitions due to sequencing
error. There are three possible transitions from the nucleotide in the
sequence of origin, each with probability 6. Thus, the probability of
substitution at sequence variant loci becomes 1 — 36. Finally, at
cross—link loci (z, : 3), which can, at the same time, be affected by
sequencing errors, T—to—C substitutions occur with probability

02(1—V)5+(1—3E)V7 (1)

where y corresponds to the probability of a T nucleotide to
be mutated to C following photo—activation and cross—link
during PAR—CLIP, i.e. to the efficiency of the protocol to induce
T—to—C substitutions at cross—link loci. We assume that the probabil—
ity 0 is bounded between e and 1 — 36, which results in the con—
straint ESO.25.

We denote by u : P(zr : 2) the probability of a locus on
the genome to be a sequence variant, and, for the remaining cases
which are not sequence variants, by 1/1 the probability that a genomic
locus is a cross—link site. The observed data at each T reference pos—
ition on the genome is then modeled by a constrained mixture of

three binomial distributions, and the probability of an observed data
point is

= (1 - l//)(1 - V)Bi"(yi;xir€)

where e, 0,y,u and r// are the parameters of the model, and the nota—
tion Bin(k; 71,17) corresponds to the probability mass function of the
Binomial distribution, precisely the probability of having [2 successes
within 71 trials with success probability p.

In absence of a control PAR—CLIP experiment, our model readily
incorporates information from A—to—C and G—to—C alterations for a
better estimation of the sequencing error e and the probability u.
The probability of observed coverage and mismatch count for
observed A—to—C and G—to—C alterations is

P((xi,yi))ri E {A, G}) : (1 — u)Bin(yi;xi, e) + uBin(yi;xi, 1 — 36).

(3)

The model (Fig. 1C) is thus fully defined by Equation (2) for refer—
ence genome T positions, and Equation (3) for A and G positions in
the reference genome. Using these equations, we can derive the like—
lihood for the entire set of observations 1) : {(xi, 35)},Eg throughout
the whole genome g as follows:

Maw/.14!!!) = P(Dl670n/.V.t//) = ,EgP((xrryr)lrr) (4)

We infer all the parameters of our model by maximizing the above
defined likelihood with a gradient—based nonlinear constrained opti—
mization (Powell, 1978). To classify each T locus on the genome as
either background, sequence variant or cross—link, we choose the
maximum of the posterior probabilities of the latent variable zi:

P(Zi = 1l(xi7yi)7ri T) 0< (1 - l//)(1 - V)Bin(yiixir 6)
P(zi : 2)(xi,yi),n : T) 0( uBin(yi;xi, 1 — 3e) (5)
P(Zi = 3l(xi7yi)7ri T) 0< 1(1(1 - V)Bin(yi;xr.0)

where the 0( symbol is used to represent proportionality between the pos—
terior probability and the product between the likelihood and the prior,
thus the normalization constant (same in all three cases) being omitted.

2.3 Construction of RNA—RBP—binding sites

By RNA-RBP—binding site we denote the region on the transcriptome
where the protein of study attaches in order to fulfill a specific func—
tion. Once high—confidence cross—link T loci were identified as
described in the previous section using a posterior cutoff of 95% for
classification, BMix reports candidate—binding sites by using all the
aligned sequencing reads that span these loci. Precisely, in order to
construct the binding sites, all the reads spanning cross—link loci are
grouped into clusters, and the cluster boundaries with coverage of 1
are trimmed out. Overlapping clusters (by at least 1 nucleotide) are
grouped into contigs and reported as candidate RNA—RBP—binding
sites (Supplementary Fig. S2). The user of BMix has the liberty to
choose a different posterior cutoff, and a different trimming coverage.

2.4 Generation of the simulated data
For the generation of realistic synthetic data, we used the AGOZ
PAR—CLIP data published in Kishore et al. (2011) for chromosme 1,

9103 ‘Org JSanV uo salaﬁuv soc} ‘BtHJOJtIBQ JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'S[BIIJHO[pJOJXO'SOIJ’BLUJOJIIIOICI”K1111] 11101} popcolumoq

BMix: probabilistic modeling of occurring substitutions in PAR—CLIP data 979

 

and, after read alignment, we introduced systematic A—to—C substitu—
tions. We could not use the T—to—C substitutions, since these were al—
ready affected by the real PAR—CLIP protocol. These substitutions
were thus ignored by all the applied methods on the simulated data,
and did not affect the analysis outcome. Instead, A—to—C substitutions
played the role of cross—link transitions in the simulated data.
Precisely, after read alignment, we randomly chose 2000 A loci on
chromosome 1. In each of these loci, we centered a window of size to.
With probability )1, we inserted A—to—C conversions in the aligned
reads at the A loci within each window (Supplementary Fig. S3). By
altering A loci within a window to, we built regions where the incor—
porated A—to—C substitutions were more dense, simulating binding
sites. The probability )1 has the interpretation of how likely a photo—
activated nucleotide within a binding site is efficiently substituted to
C in the PAR—CLIP protocol. We simulated data both considering u
uniform across the different genomic positions, as well as non—
uniform, drawn from a Beta distribution (see Section 3). For the latter
case, the parameters of the Beta distribution were shared between all
the altered genomic loci. The produced simulated data contain a real—
istic amount of sequencing errors and contamination, and is based on
the alteration of a reference base different from T. We assessed the
performance of BMix, PARalyzer and WavClusteR on these data.

2.5 Comparison with other methods

We compared BMix to PARalyzer v1.1 (Corcoran et al., 2011) and
WavClusteR v2.0.0 (Comoglio et al., 2015) on the produced syn—
thetic data, as well as on publicly available PAR—CLIP datasets pub—
lished in Kishore et al. (2011), Sievers et al. (2012) and Hafner et al.
(2010). On simulated data, the three methods were compared in
terms of accuracy. The accuracy is defined as the ratio of true posi—
tive and true negative loci over the entire set of observed loci. The
true positives correspond to the A loci where A—to—C substitutions
were introduced in the synthetic datasets (cf. Section 2.4), and also
reported as cross—link loci by the tested method. The true negatives
correspond to the loci which were not altered in the synthetic data—
sets, and which were not reported as cross—link loci by the tested
method. On real data, the methods were evaluated according to spe—
cific characteristics of the studied proteins, such as their affinity for
microRNA (miRNA), 3’ —untranslated regions (3’UTRs), and introns
annotated in the RefSeq database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
refseq/), enrichment of protein—specific RNA recognition elements
(RREs), as well as execution time. The reported execution time cor—
responds to the amount of time spent running by each method on
one core of a Linux machine with a clock rate of 2.3 GHz.

3 Results

We validated our model on synthetic and real human PAR—CLIP
data and assessed its performance compared with PARalyzer and
WavClusteR methods (see Section 2).

3.1 Performance on simulated PAR—CLIP data

In the absence of a ground truth dataset for protein—binding sites, we
generated a set of synthetic datasets in order to evaluate our model
and compare it to the existing methods WavClusteR and PARalyzer.
We started from real world PAR—CLIP data and mimicked in silico
the PAR—CLIP protocol for a different substitution than T—to—C, pre—
cisely A—to—C. In this way, we kept the intrinsic noise and contamin—
ation levels specific to PAR—CLIP data and, at the same time,
introduced validation cross—link loci. Furthermore, the simulated
data was built independently from our model, providing an

unbiased test set for all the methods. Knowing thus the genomic loci
where A—to—C substitutions were introduced, we could test how ac—
curate BMix as well as other methods were in detecting these loci.

We first performed a simulation study assuming )1 is uniform
and tested different values for )1, between 0.1 and 0.9, each time
with three different window sizes: 15, 21 and 31 nucleotides long.
We applied BMix, PARalyzer and WavClusteR on 100 simulated
datasets (cf. Section 2), for each combination of u and window size
w. In all the different simulation scenarios, BMix had a significantly
higher accuracy (Wilcoxon test P < 1074) than the other two meth—
ods (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4). For example, for w:21,
BMix had on average an accuracy of 96%, compared with 88.6%
for WavClusteR, and 76% for PARalyzer. All methods reached their
lowest accuracy at u : 0.1. However, while WavClusteR and
PARalyzer had similar accuracy for this case (75 and 71%, respect—
ively), BMix outperformed them with an accuracy of 88%. By look—
ing at the outcome of the three methods on a randomly chosen
synthetic dataset with u: 0.2 and w:21 (Supplementary Fig. S5),
the main characteristics of each method were exposed. Precisely,
after learning non—linear classification boundaries, BMix reached a
true positive rate of 93%, and a true negative rate of 98%
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). WavClusteR detected only 68% of the
true validation loci, having difficulty in detecting the cross—link loci
located in the low—coverage regions (Supplementary Fig. S5 C).
PARalyzer was affected by the low substitution probability, )1 : 0.2,
and detected only 53.6% of the validation cross—link loci.
Specifically, the method preferentially reported sites which had
high—frequency A—to—C substitutions, and ignored validation sites
with low—frequency transitions (Supplementary Fig. S5D).

Next, we performed simulations where the conversion probability
)1 was drawn from a Beta distribution whose parameters were the
same across the simulated cross—link loci. For the previously defined
window sizes, we tested different simulation scenarios, where we var—
ied the mean of the Beta distribution between 0.1 and 0.9, and the
variance was 0.001 or 0.005 (density of distributions showed in
Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). On all the newly simulated datasets,
BMix had significantly superior accuracy. For example, for “1:21
and 0.001 variance of the Beta distribution, BMix had an average ac—
curacy of 90%, while WavClusteR and PARalyzer had an average ac—
curacy of 79.4 and 55.7%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8). The
same behavior of the methods was observed as before, namely with

PARalyzer reporting all the loci with high—frequency substitutions as
cross—link sites, and WavClusteR having difficulties in identifying the
cross—link loci within low coverage regions (Supplementary Fig. S9).

We further compared the three methods in terms of reporting the
correct binding site boundaries on three synthetic datasets generated
with conversion windows it! of 31, 21 and 15 bases, and uniform
probability 1120.2. To assess the performance, for each identified
validation locus, we computed the Jaccard Coefficient
(Levandowsky and Winter, 1971) between the generated synthetic—
binding site (window it! centered in the locus) and the binding site
reported for that locus with each method. For a window w:31,
BMix had a superior average Jaccard coefficient of 0.72 compared
with 0.685 obtained with WavClusteR, and 0.643 with PARalyzer
(Supplementary Fig. S10). For shorter lengths of the synthetic—bind—
ing sites, all the three methods decreased their performance in re—
porting the correct boundaries, having comparable average Jaccard
coefficients (Supplementary Figs. S11 and S12).

3.2 Application to real PAR—CLIP datasets

We ultimately applied our method on three published human PAR—
CLIP datasets corresponding to proteins AGOZ, HUR (Kishore et
al., 2011) and MOV10 (Sievers et al., 2012), and inferred the model
parameters for each dataset. With BMix, one can choose to learn
the parameters either separately for the forward and reverse strands,
or combine the strands. Depending on the studied protein and ex—
perimental setup (e.g. strand—specific libraries), one of these proced—
ures might be more appropriate. In our analysis, in order to avoid
any inﬂuence from strand bias, we have learned the parameters of
the model independently for both strands. However, for the three
tested datasets, the results are equivalent when both strands are
combined (Supplementary Table S1). We applied WavClusteR and
PARalyzer on the same data and we compared the three different
methods by evaluating their results according to specific characteris—
tics of the proteins such as miRNA, 3’UTR, and intron affinity, as
well as enrichment of protein—specific RREs.

By comparing the PAR—CLIP data for the AGOZ protein
to matched RNA—Seq data from the same sample, published in
Kishore et al. (2011), we observed the expected prevalence of T—to—C
substitutions (Supplementary Fig. S13), but also a significantly larger
amount of A—to—C and G—to—C alterations (one—tailed Wilcoxon test
P < 1073) in the AGO2 PAR—CLIP dataset (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Fig. S14), indicating a high level of contamination.

BMix identified 15 317 binding sites for replicate A, and 9615
binding sites for replicate B of the AGOZ dataset. We annotated the
three classes of loci reported by BMix (background, sequence variant
and cross—link) according to the Ensembl gene types retrieved using
the UCSC Table Browser (Karolchik et al., 2004). A higher propor—
tion of background and sequence variant loci overlapped with riboso—
mal RNA (rRNA) and unannotated regions than the cross—link loci
which mostly covered protein—coding regions (Fig. 4A). Both
PARalyzer and WavClusteR reported around 4000 more binding sites
than BMix (Supplementary Table S2). Annotation of the binding sites
according to the same Ensembl types showed that a large proportion
of these additional sites covered significantly more rRNA and unan—
notated regions and less protein—coding regions compared with the
common sites (Fig. 4B). To assess the reproducibility of the three
methods, each method was applied on each AGOZ replicate dataset
independently, and the number of common miRNAs found within the
binding sites between replicates was reported. All the three methods
yielded a similar high percentage of reproducible miRNAs: 88.6% for
BMix, 88.98% for PARalyzer and 89.1% for WavClusteR (Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Table S2). All the three tested methods identified
z 30% less binding sites for replicate B than for replicate A. We
investigated the difference between replicates and we observed that,
unlike replicate A, replicate B had a lower percentage of aligned reads
(42.5% as opposed to 60.6%), a lower coverage, and a lower preva—
lence of T—to—C substitutions (Supplementary Fig. S15), explaining the
lower amount of identified binding sites. Furthermore, Kishore et al.
(2011) report a correlation of only 61% between these two replicates.

For both replicates, over 95% of the binding sites identified with
BMix overlapped with the sites found by the two other methods.
BMix reported on average 4% more of its binding sites within
3’UTRs than the other two methods (Fig. 5B and Supplementary
Table S2). Over 70% of the binding sites reported by BMix were <30
nucleotides long (Supplementary Fig. S16A), in concordance with the
expected small length of miRNA targets. Furthermore, given that it
has been previously reported that some targeted 3’UTRs may have
high miRNA target—site abundance (Garcia et al., 2011), we investi—
gated the number of identified binding sites in each 3’UTR. We found
that over 85% of the covered 3’UTRs contained at most two binding
sites (64% had only one binding site), while a small proportion had
more than two binding sites (Supplementary Fig. S20A). A similar per—
centage was obtained when only binding sites in mRNAs were con—
sidered, precisely 86% 3’UTRs had at most two mRNA—binding sites
(64.4% had only one binding site, Supplementary Fig. S21A).

We performed de novo motif discovery using the Software MEME
(Bailey and Elkan, 1994) for the AGOZ—binding sites found by each
method in 3’UTRs. The motifs were ranked following their E—value,
and only motifs with an E—value < 0.05 were reported. We observe
that the identified motifs are analogous between the three methods,
with the sequence ‘TGCTGCT’ found to be the most significant by all
methods. Furthermore, these motifs were also found prevalent within
sequences of various known miRNAs (Supplementary Tables S3—S5).
In terms of execution time, the MEME motif search on BMix—binding
sites was considerably faster, running for 11 h, as compared with 26 h
for PARalyzer, and 2 days for WavClusteR.

3.2.2 Identification of MOV10-binding sites

Next, we applied the three methods on a dataset for the MOV10 pro—
tein, also expected to preferentially bind in 3’UTRs (Kenny et al.,
2014; Sievers et al., 2012). In absence of replicates, we could not assess

previous dataset, BMix found a higher percentage of its binding sites
(56.39%) in 3’UTRs than PARalyzer and WavClusteR which obtained
an overlap of 40.14 and 50.4%, respectively (Fig. 5C and Supplemen—
tary Table S6). Furthermore, >96% of the binding sites reported by
BMix overlapped with the ones found by the two other methods.

3.2.3 Identification of HUR-binding sites
Finally, we applied a similar evaluation scheme on two replicate
PAR—CLIP datasets for the HUR protein, a well—characterized RBP
involved in maintaining mRNA stability and regulating gene expres—
sion (Peng et al., 1998). It has been shown that this protein preferen—
tially binds AU—rich regions in 3’UTRs of messenger RNAs, as well
as intronic regions (Lebedeva et al., 2011). Therefore, we quantified
the amount of binding sites found by each method within these gen—
omic features for each replicate independently, as well as their en—
richment for HUR—specific RREs described in Ma et al. (1996).

For both replicates, the binding sites found by BMix overlapped
over 90% with the binding sites reported by the other methods

(Supplementary Table S7). To assess the reproducibility of the meth—
ods, we evaluated the percentage of RRE—enriched sites common be—
tween the two replicates. Even though it reported less binding sites
than the other methods, BMix reached a higher reproducibility of
50.8% compared with 49.45% obtained with PARalyzer and
46.27% reported by WavClusteR (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Table
S7). For both replicates, BMix had also a superior percentage of
RRE—enriched sites than the other two methods (Supplementary
Table S7).

BMix, PARalyzer and WavClusteR were applied on each repli—
cate HUR dataset independently. For both replicates, BMix reported
more binding sites within 3’UTRs and intronic regions compared
with the other two methods (Fig. 5E). Precisely, 68.1% of the sites
reported by BMix for replicate A overlapped with 3’UTRs and in—
tronic regions, while PARalyzer and WavClusteR attained 66.95
and 68.06%, respectively. For replicate B, despite the lower number
of reported sites, BMix had a superior overlap with 3’UTRs, namely
66.83%, compared with 59.83 and 59.37% obtained by PARalyzer
and WavClusteR, respectively (Supplementary Table S7).

For all the datasets, the additional cross—link loci reported by
PARalyzer and WavClusteR compared with BMix had either a low
substitution frequency and low coverage, or a high substitution fre—
quency. To illustrate this, we calculated, for each method, the frac—
tion of reported loci with a particular T—to—C substitution frequency
out of the total number of observed loci with that substitution fre—
quency. PARalyzer reported all the high—frequency altered loci with
no exception, while WavClusteR learned a more lenient threshold
than BMix for the low and high substitution frequency regions
(Fig. 5F—H and Supplementary Fig. S23). Furthermore, the add—
itional binding sites reported by the two other methods were more
prevalent in rRNA and unannotated regions compared with the
BMix sites (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S25). A large proportion
of the binding sites identified with BMix were short, with a median
length of 30 bases. Paralyzer and WavclusteR yielded slightly
shorter binding sites, with median lengths of 17 and 21 bases, re—
spectively (Supplementary Figs. S16—S18). One can decrease the me—
dian length of binding sites reported by BMix by progressively
increasing the trimming coverage threshold used to refine the clus—
ters before merging them (Supplementary Fig. S19).

We analyzed the impact of the alignment strategy on the results of
our method by testing BMix on Bowtie—aligned AGO2 PAR—CLIP
data (Kishore et al., 2011), allowing for one to three mismatches. The
number of BMix—reported binding sites increased to over 40%, from
15 317 sites with one mismatch to 21 607 and 25 289 sites with two
and three mismatches, respectively. Over 50% of the identified bind—
ing sites with two or three mismatches were also detected with one
mismatch (Supplementary Table S9). More than 85% of the binding
sites identified with BMix using one mismatch were also found by
using two or three mismatches. Nevertheless, the configuration of the
three types of loci classified with BMix changed as the number of mis—
matches was increased. Precisely, the fraction of reported cross—linked
loci decreased, whereas the other two classes gained in size as the
number of allowed mismatches increased (Supplementary Fig. S26A).
On the other hand, PARalyzer doubled the number of reported bind—
ing sites when more than one mismatch was allowed, reporting
19248 sites for one mismatch, 40522 sites for two mismatches and
51 029 sites for three mismatches. WavClusteR functions specifically
for alignments with one allowed mismatch, therefore testing for more
mismatches was not possible. We performed the same analysis with
BMix by choosing TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009) as aligner
(Supplementary Fig. S26B) on the same dataset, although PAR—CLIP
reads are generally too short to be efficiently used by a splice—aware
aligner. Similar results were obtained with TopHat as with Bowtie, es—
pecially when one or two mismatches were allowed (Supplementary
Tables S9 and S10, and Supplementary Fig. S26).

In terms of execution time, on one core of a Linux machine with
a clock rate of 2.3 GHz, BMix proved to be considerably faster than
the other two methods, running on average in <40 min on all the
datasets. On the contrary, the execution time of both PARalyzer and
WavClusteR on the same machine increased with the sample size
from several hours to multiple days for the HUR datasets (Fig. 5 I).

3.2.4 Comparison to RNA Bind-n—Seq for IGF2BP1

We also performed an analysis on a PAR—CLIP dataset for protein
IGF2BP1 (Hafner et al., 2010), where an RNA Bind—n—Seq dataset
was also available [Lambert et al. (2014), project ENCSR928XOW
on ENCODE]. RNA Bind—n—Seq (RBNS) is a recent method that
queries in vitro the binding predilections of RBPs against an elabor—
ate, randomized pool of RNA short fragments at different protein
concentrations. It has been shown that RBNS provides an extensive,
biologically relevant landscape of RBP—binding motifs, covering

various affinities and has been proposed as an enhancement and val—
idation step for CLIP—based methods (Lambert et al., 2014). We
used the 7mers found by RNBS at concentration 320 nM, which had
an enrichment value (K) two SDs larger than the overall mean [as
proposed by Lambert et al. (2014), Supplementary Fig. S22] to val—
idate the PAR—CLIP—binding sites identified with the three methods.
Surprisingly, over 76% of the binding sites reported by BMix also
contained at least one of the significant RBNS motifs, while only
46.06% of the Paralyzer sites, and 65.24% of the WavClusteR sites
presented RBNS motifs within their sequences. Furthermore, the ca—
nonical motifs ‘CAUU’ and ‘CUUU’were contained within 30% of
the RBNS significant 7mers, and were also found more prevalent
within the BMix—binding sites as compared with the other methods
(Supplementary Table S8).

4 Discussion

In this work, we have proposed BMix, a new probabilistic model for
identifying high—confidence RNA—protein interaction sites from PAR—
CLIP data. BMix uses a constrained three—component binomial mix—
ture model to describe the T—to—C substitutions observed at genomic
loci in three categories: low—frequency errors due to sequencing noise,
true cross—link sites or high—frequency sequence variants caused by
SNPs or contamination. Therefore, our model brings the novelty of
accounting for both low and high—frequency erroneous T—to—C alter—
ations in PAR—CLIP data. We validated and demonstrated the superior
performance of BMix compared with the methods WavClusteR
v2.0.0 and PARalyzer v1.1 both on synthetic and real data.

Most of the current PAR—CLIP analysis methods focus on filter—
ing low—frequency altered loci and consider the high—frequency sub—
stitutions as reliable indicators of cross—linking. We have observed
this behavior also within our study on synthetic and real data, where
PARalyzer has selected all the high—frequency altered loci within its
reported binding sites (Figs. 5F—H). However, methods like PARaly—
zer ignore the possibility that high—frequency alterations could have
been caused by other factors, such as contamination, or single nu—
cleotide variants. By comparing PAR—CLIP and matched control
RNA—Seq data from the same experiment, the prevalence of highly
altered loci was clearly observed also for non T—to—C substitutions in
published data (Fig. 3), which motivates the need of identifying and
discarding spurious highly altered loci from the analysis. BMix had
on average an accuracy at least 20% larger than PARalyzer on simu—
lated data (cf. Section 3.1 of Results). So far, only WavClusteR ac—
counts for high—frequency substitutions. However, because it uses
relative substitution frequency values instead of actual read counts,
the method looses performance especially in low and high substitu—
tion regions, and where the coverage is weak, as presented in real
and synthetic data applications, having an accuracy on average in—
ferior by 7% to BMix. In an extensive simulation study, by varying
the probability )1, we have observed that the accuracy of both BMix
and WavClusteR attains a global maximum at u: 0.6 and 0.7, re—
spectively, and then decreases. In other words, a perfect 100% PAR—
CLIP T—to—C substitution efficiency would not improve the result;
on the contrary, it would make difficult to differentiate between
induced substitutions and high—frequency errors.

The Ensembl annotation of the three classes of loci reported by
BMix showed that our model captures more rRNA and unannotated
RNA within its background and sequence variant mixture compo—
nents, while the reported cross—link loci mainly cover protein—coding
regions and miRNAs. The PARalyzer approach, based on selecting
high—frequency mutations as high—confidence—binding sites is there—
fore at risk of reporting a large amount of spurious alterations as

cross—link loci. WavClusteR is exposed to the same risk by using
relative frequencies instead of substitutions counts, thus disregard—
ing uncertainty in the low coverage regions. BMix identified less
binding sites than the other two methods, at the same time keeping
high the proportion of reproducible binding sites overlapping with
features of interest. The other methods detected many additional
sites that typically overlapped with rRNA and unannotated regions.
This suggests that BMix output is more reliable and contains less
false positives. This facilitates downstream analyses, such as motif
search, or understanding RNA regulation. The binding sites identi—
fied with BMix had a higher prevalence of canonical—binding motifs
previously reported in literature, as well as RNA Bind—n—Seq motifs,
compared with the other methods.

BMix, as well as the other PAR—CLIP analysis methods, relies on
the alignment of sequencing reads to a reference genome. In this
work, we have chosen the standard alignment strategy employed by
PARalyzer and WavClusteR, aligning the sequencing reads with
Bowtie and allowing for one mismatch. However, a strict alignment
strategy would potentially discard reads with viable cross—link T—to—C
alterations. Due to explicit modeling of noise and contamination, our
model is less sensitive to the choice of alignment and is able to control
the false positive rate even for more lenient alignment parameters. As
a result, the user of BMix can pick the alignment procedure which
best suits the data without having to maintain a too strict control on
the alignment parameters. This procedure depends on multiple aspects
such as, e.g. the quality of the sequencing, the length of the reads or
the binding protein (Konig et al., 2012). Ultimately, a systematic com—
parison of the results obtained from different alignment strategies can
be utilized for a better quantification of the binding sites.

A limitation of our method consists in the difficulty of sorting out
T—to—C substitutions of moderate frequency which have not been intro—
duced by PAR—CLIP. These can occur following diverse molecular
processes such as, e.g. RNA editing by ADAR enzyme (Samuel, 2011),
following contamination, or as heterozygous SNPs. In this case, any
analysis relying entirely on coverage and substitution counts does not
have sufficient statistical power to discard these false loci, and our
method can report false positives. Nevertheless, these substitutions
would also appear during a control experiment. Therefore, a potential
solution to this limitation would be to use a control PAR—CLIP, or
RNA—seq experiment. These would reveal spurious substitutions to be
subtracted from the cross—link T—to—C loci identified with BMix.

Due to the reduction of sequencing costs, a high increase in sequenc—
ing—based experiments such as PAR—CLIP is expected in the near future.
BMix provides a rigorous probabilistic method which is significantly
faster and more accurate than the current state—of—the art methods for
detecting RNA—protein interaction sites in PAR—CLIP data.

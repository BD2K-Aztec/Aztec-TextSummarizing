Abstract

Summary: BGT is a compact format, a fast command line tool and a simple web application for effi—
cient and convenient query of whole—genome genotypes and frequencies across tens to hundreds
0fth0usands of samples. On real data, it encodes the haplotypes of 32 488 samples across 39.2 mil—
lion SNPs into a 7.4 GB database and decodes up to 420 million genotypes per CPU second. The
high performance enables real—time responses to complex queries.

1 Introduction

VCF/BCF (Danecek et (11., 2011) is the primary format for storing
and analyzing genotypes of multiple samples. It however has a few
issues. First, VCF is a site-oriented format. Although accessing a site
and all the associated genotypes is efficient with indexing, retrieving
site annotations or the genotypes of a few samples always requires
to decode the genotypes of all samples, which is unnecessarily ex-
pensive. Second, VCF does not take advantage of linkage disequilib-
rium (LD), while using this information can dramatically improve
compression ratio (Durbin, 2014). Third, a VCF record is not clearly
defined. Each record may consist of multiple alleles with each allele
composed of multiple SNPs and INDELs. This ambiguity compli-
cates annotations, query of alleles and integration of multiple
datasets. At last, most existing VCF-hased tools do not support ex-
pressive data query. We frequently need to write scripts for
advanced queries, which costs hoth development and processing
time. GQT (Layer et (11., 2015) attempts to solve some of these
issues. Although it is very fast for selecting a subset of samples and
for traversing all sites, it discards phasing, is inefficient for region
query and is not compressed well. The observations of these limita-
tions motivated us to develop BGT.

2 Methods

Unlike VCF which stores sample phenotypes, site annotations and
genotypes all in one file, BGT separates the three types of information

into individual files. BGT keeps diploid genotypes as a 2-hit integer
matrix (Hki) with row indexed by a pair of overlapping reference/
non-reference alleles and column by a sample haplotype (thus for 771’
samples, the matrix has Zm’ columns). Hki takes value 0 if the i-th
haplotype has the reference allele in the allele pair at row k, takes 1 if
the haplotype has the non-reference allele, 2 if unknown and 3 if the
haplotype has a different non-reference allele. BGT arhitrarily phases
unphased genotypes and always hreaks complex variants in VCF
down to the smallest possible variants. It keeps the allele pairs (i.e.
rows) in a site-only BCF, disallowing multiple alleles per VCF line,
and stores the integer matrix as two positional BWTs (PBWTs), one
for the lower hit and the other for the higher hit.

BGT ohtains phenotypes and site annotations from files in the
Flat Metadata Format (FMF). FMF is TAB-delimted with the first
column showing the row name and following columns giving typed
key-value pairs. An example looks like:

samplel gender:Z:M height:f:l.73 foo:i:lO
sample2 gender:Z:F height:f:l.64 barziz20

BGT can retrieve rows via an arbitrary expression such as
‘height > 1.65’.

The multi-file design makes BGT unfriendly to data streaming
but it enables BGT to use one set of site annotations across multiple
BGT files and allows users to modify phenotypes and annotations
without re-encoding all the genotypes.

2.1 PBVVT overview
PBWT (Durbin, 2014) is a generic way to encode binary matrices.
Let (Ak),z : (A0.  .An_1) denote a list of m—long binary strings.
(Ak),z can be regarded as an n X m binary matrix with Akli] repre—
senting the cell at row k and column 1'. For simplicity, introduce a
sentinel row A_1 : $o$1--- $m_1 with a lexicographical order
$0 <---< $m_1.

Define binary string:

Pt,- : Arm/«tau ... AolilA—1lil

to be the reverse of the column prefix ending at (k, i) and define Sk(i)
to be the column index of the i—th smallest prefix among set {Pk/L. .
Sk(i) is a bijection on {0. . . . .m — 1} and thus invertible. In a special
case, S_1(i) : 1' because P-1d : A_1  : $,.

The PBWT of (Ak),z is (Bk)k, which is calculated by

Bklil I Arise—M01
An important use of (B k) k is to compute Sh. Define
(212(1) : Ck(Bklil) + rank/43121470

where Ck(b) gives the number of symbols in B k that are lexicograph—
ically smaller than b and rankk(b. i) the number of b symbols in Bk
before position i. The i—th smallest column in row k — 1 is ranked (1),,
(i) in row k. Thus

sum» 2 Ste—1(1)

Given Ah and Sk_1, we can compute Sh and Bk in the order of
Bk —> d);z —> Sk, starting from k : 0. Conversely, given Bk and Sk_1,
computing (1),, —> S), —> A;z derives Ah from Bk.

When there are strong correlations between adjacent rows,
which is true for haplotype data due to LD, 0 s and 1 s tend to form
long runs in Bk. This usually makes Bk much more compressible
than Ah under run—length encoding. For our test dataset, 32 000
genotypes in a row can be compressed to < 200 bytes in average.

2.2 Query genotypes and output

A BGT query may consist of three types of conditions: (a) genotype—
independent sample selection, such as a list of sample names or an
arbitrary expression on phenotypes; (b) genotype—independent site
selection, such as a genomic region, a list of alleles or an arbitrary
expression on variant annotations; (c) genotype—dependent site con—
ditions, such as alleles being common among selected samples. We
may select multiple groups of samples with (a)—typed conditions. For
each group, BGT will compute aggregate variables, including the
number of called samples and the allele count, which can be output—
ted or used in (c)—typed conditions.

BGT usually outputs VCF/BCF with aggregate variables written
to the INFO field. It may optionally output a TAB—delimited table
on user selected fields. BGT may also output the samples having a
list of alleles, and the counts of haplotypes across requested alleles
in multiple sample groups.

2.3 BGT server

BGT comes with a standalone web server frontend implemented in
the Go programming language. The server has a similar interface to
the command line tool but with additional consideration of sample
anonymity. With BGT, each sample has an attribute ‘minimal group
size’ or MGS. If a query selects a group containing a sample with a

MGS larger than the requested group size, the server will refuse the
request. In particular, if a sample has MGS larger than one, users
cannot access its sample name and individual genotypes but can re—
trieve allele counts computed together with other samples. This pre—
vents users to access data at the level of a single sample.

3 Results

We generated the BGT database for the first release of Haplotype
Reference Consortium (HRC; http://bit.ly/HRC—org). The input is a
BCF containing 32488 samples across 39.2 million SNPs on auto—
somes. The BGT file size is 7.4 GB, 11% of the genotype—only BCF
or 8% of GQT. Decoding the genotypes of all samples across 142 k
sites in a 10 Mbp region takes 11 CPU seconds, which amounts to
decoding 420 million genotypes per second. This speed is even faster
than computing allele counts and outputting VCF.

We use the following command line to demonstrate the query
syntax of BGT:

bgt view —G —d var. fmf . 92 —a’ gene::“BRCAl" ’ \
—s ’ source::“IBD" ’ —s ’ source::“lOOOG" ’ \
—f ’ACl/ANl>:O . OOl&&AC2/AN2>:O . OOl’ \
HRC—rl.bgt

It finds BRCA1 variants annotated in ‘var.fmf.gz’ that have 20.1%
frequency in both the IBD dataset (http://www.ibdresearch.co.uk)
and 1000 Genomes (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012). In
this command line, —G disables the output of genotypes. Option —a
selects variants with the ‘gene’ attribute equal to ‘BRCA1’ according
to the variant database specified with —d. This condition is a (b)—
typed condition independent of sample genotypes. Each option —s
sets an (a)—typed condition, selecting a group of samples based on
phenotypes. For the #—th sample group/ —s, BGT counts the total
number of called alleles and the number of non—reference alleles and
writes them to the AN# and AC# aggregate variables, respectively.
Option — f then use these aggregate variables to filter output. This is
a (c)—typed condition.

The command line earlier takes 12 CPU seconds with most of
time spent on reading through the variant annotation file to find
matching alleles. The BGT server reads the entire file into memory
to alleviate the overhead but a better solution would be to use a
proper database for variant annotations.

To demonstrate the server frontend, we have also set up a public
BGT server at http://bgtdemo.herokuapp.com. It hosts 1000
Genomes haplotypes for chromosome 1 1 and 20.

4 Discussion

Given a multi—sample VCF, most BGT functionalities can be
achieved with small scripts, but as a command line tool, BGT has a
few advantages. First, it saves development time. Extracting infor—
mation from multiple files can be done with a command line instead
of a script. Second, BGT saves processing time. With high—perform—
ance C code at the core, BGT is much faster than processing VCF in
a scripting language such as Perl or Python. For example, deriving
allele counts in a 10 Mbp region for the HRC data takes 305 with
BGT, but doing the same with a Perl script takes 40 min, a 80—fold
difference. Third, the design of one non—reference allele per record
simplifies BGT merge and makes it twice as fast as bcftools merge
on two genotype—only input files.

The BGT server tries to solve a bigger problem: data sharing.
Instead of always delivering full data in VCF, projects could have a
new option to serve data publicly with the BGT server, letting users
select the summary statistics of interest on the fly while keeping sam—
ples unidentifiable. This is an improvement to Stade et al. (2014)
which only provide precomputed summary.

We acknowledge that our MGS—based data sharing policy might
have oversimplified real scenarios, but we believe this direction,
with proper improvements and more importantly the approval of
ethical review boards, will be more open, convenient, efficient and
secure than our current share—everything—with—trust model.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A major challenge in systems biology is to reveal the
cellular pathways that give rise to specific phenotypes and behaviours.
Current techniques often rely on a network representation of molecular
interactions, where each node represents a protein or a gene and each
interaction is assigned a single static score. However, the use of single
interaction scores fails to capture the tendency of proteins to favour
different partners under distinct cellular conditions.

Results: Here, we propose a novel context-sensitive network model,
in which genes and protein nodes are assigned multiple contexts
based on their gene ontology annotations, and their interactions are
associated with multiple context-sensitive scores. Using this model,
we developed a new approach and a corresponding tool, ContextNet,
based on a dynamic programming algorithm for identifying signalling
paths linking proteins to their downstream target genes. ContextNet
finds high-ranking context-sensitive paths in the interactome, thereby
revealing the intermediate proteins in the path and their path-speciﬁc
contexts. We validated the model using 18348 manually curated cel-
lular paths derived from the SPIKE database. We next applied our
framework to elucidate the responses of human primary lung cells
to influenza infection. Top-ranking paths were much more likely to
contain infection-related proteins, and this likelihood was highly cor-
related with path score. Moreover, the contexts assigned by the algo-
rithm pointed to putative, as well as previously known responses to
viral infection. Thus, context sensitivity is an important extension to
current network biology models and can be efficiently used to eluci-
date cellular response mechanisms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Complex diseases and Viral infections are among the major prob-
lems in human health today. In an effort to broaden our under-
standing of the molecular basis of these diseases, they are
increasingly interrogated using a variety of large-scale experi-
mental techniques. Major techniques include sequencing efforts
to reveal disease-related mutations, mRNA proﬁling to reveal
genes that are differentially expressed during disease and
siRNA screens to reveal disease-related proteins (e.g. Shapira
et al., 2009), thereby revealing distinct subsets of the genes and
proteins involved.

Recent studies demonstrate the strength of integrative
approaches in broadening our understanding of disease
processes (reviewed in Ideker and Sharan, 2008; Schadt, 2009).
Central to many integrative approaches is the molecular inter-
action network (interactome) paradigm, where interactome
nodes represent proteins or genes, and interactome edges repre-
sent their physical and regulatory interactions. Interactomes pro-
vide a convenient framework for exploring the context within
which disease genes operate, and they were successfully used to
illuminate new disease genes (e.g. Guan et al., 2012; Magger
et al., 2012), and their functions, as recently reviewed by
Barabasi et a]. (2011).

Because of the importance of signalling paths in health and
disease, several computational efforts exploited the interactome
framework for their elucidation. By connecting mutated proteins
with their downstream differentially expressed targets, Yeang
et a]. (2004) identiﬁed intermediate proteins in the paths and
assigned directionality to undirected proteiniprotein interactions
(PPIs). Later studies identiﬁed interactome sub-networks relating
the results of high-throughput genetic screening and mRNA pro-
filing (Suthram et al., 2008; Tuncbag et al., 2012; Yeger-Lotem
et al., 2009; Yosef et al., 2009). And yet another set of studies
computed putative signalling paths by connecting membrane
proteins to transcription factors (Bebek and Yang, 2007;
Steffen et al., 2002; Tuncbag et al., 2012), while limiting the
types and relative order of the proteins on the path (Scott
et al., 2006; Steffen et al., 2002; Tuncbag et al., 2012).
Although based on different computational techniques, each of
these studies relied on a typical network representation, where
each edge is assigned a single score based on its estimated reli-
ability (e.g. Szklarczyk et al., 2011) or relevance to a speciﬁc
cellular process (e.g. Cakmak and Ozsoyoglu, 2007; Myers
et al., 2005; Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009).

Yet, single edge scores fail to capture the complexity of biolo-
gical systems, where the activation of a speciﬁc protein may lead
to multiple responses, depending on the current cellular condi-
tion. We illustrate this phenomenon using the human protein
GRB2, an epidermal growth factor receptor-binding protein
that is known to mediate several cellular signalling cascades
(Fig. 1). Although GRB2 physically interacts with many different
proteins, recent experimental analysis of its physical interactions
has shown that its sub-network remodels itself dramatically in
response to different stimuli (Bisson et al., 2011). For example, in
the context of Viral infection GRB2 tends to interact with inter-
feron regulatory factor IRFS, whereas in the context of insulin
signalling, it tends to interact with the insulin receptor substrate
IRSl. Thus, examining GRB2 physical interactions regardless of
cellular context will mask this important distinction.

Fig. 1. The human protein GRB2 interacts through high-conﬁdence PPIs
with proteins from 10 distinct cellular processes

Here, we describe a novel computational framework that aims
to capture the context dependence of molecular interactions.
There are several methods that search for paths or transitions
between functional contexts in interactomes (e.g. Banks et al.,
2008; Pandey et al., 2007). In contrast, the novelty of our ap-
proach is not in the consideration of context but rather in the
proposed computational model that allows for the consideration
of multiple candidate context pairs for each molecular interaction.
We provide a context-sensitive algorithm that scores context-spe-
ciﬁc paths leading from a source protein to a differentially ex-
pressed gene. The algorithm selects a single context pair per
interaction, based on the context selected for the preceding inter-
action in the path. Paths are then scored according to the selected
context pairs, and high-scoring paths are reported.

Context dependence has often been associated with tissues or
cell types (Schaefer, 2012), and with different biological states,
such as cell cycle stages (de Lichtenberg et al., 2005) or response
to stimuli (Barrios-Rodiles et al., 2005). In this study, we dem-
onstrate our context-sensitive framework by using gene ontology
(GO) terms as the biological context. We ﬁrst show the validity
of the proposed model by using a set of manually curated human
pathways (Paz et al., 2011). We then demonstrate the ability of
the framework to identify relevant interaction paths by analysing
the response of human primary lung cells to inﬂuenza infection
(Shapira et al., 2009). Notably, a signiﬁcant fraction of the pro-
teins that the algorithm predicted were indeed found to affect the
infection process, and the success rate of the prediction was sig-
niﬁcantly correlated with the path score. We implemented our
proposed framework as a tool, ContextNet, which is publicly
available at http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/ContextNet.

2 RESULTS

Our results include the proposed context-sensitive framework, its
implementation as a tool, a statistical assertion that known cel-
lular pathways in human are indeed context-sensitive and ﬁnally
the application of our framework to identify and interpret the
proteins and pathways underlying the response of human cells to
Viral infection.

2.1 A context-sensitive framework for identifying
signalling paths

Our proposed framework consists of an interactome model, a

context-based scoring scheme and a path interpretation and scor-

ing algorithm.

2.1.] Interactome model Our model of the human interactome
consists of distinct nodes that represent either human proteins or
genes, and edges that represent their experimentally detected
PPIs and proteiniDNA interactions that were downloaded
from several databases (see Section 5), resulting in 176 849 inter-
actions among 14 362 proteins and genes. We then added context
to the network by using GO annotations (Ashburner et al., 2000)
as follows. Each GO annotation was considered as a distinct
label and was associated with the corresponding gene and pro-
tein nodes. Each interaction was associated with the Cartesian
product of the labels of the interacting nodes.

2.1.2 Context-based scoring matrix We constructed a context-
transition scoring matrix, M, which assigns to each pair of labels
a score that reﬂects the likelihood of the pair in known pathways.
To compute the context-transition scores, we used the SPIKE
database of manually curated human pathways (Paz et al., 2011).
Speciﬁcally, we extracted from SPIKE all signalling paths that
connect a protein to a gene with the last edge in the path being a
transcription regulation edge. We then directed these 18 438
simple paths from the protein to the gene and combined them
into a set of 6762 unique directed interactions. From these inter-
actions, we calculated the conditional probability P(lj | I,) that
reﬂects the likelihood of observing a directed interaction pointing
from a node with label I,- to a node with label  We further fine-
tuned this context-transition scoring scheme as described in
Section 5.

2.1.3 Algorithm for context-sensitive path interpretation and
scoring Our framework identifies top-scoring context-sensitive
paths connecting a protein to a differentially expressed gene. An
overall illustration of the framework is shown in Figure 2. Given
a source protein and a target gene, the algorithm first identiﬁes in
the network all simple paths of lengths from 2 to k that connect
the source to the target, where k is a predeﬁned user parameter.
Next, it uses the context-transition scoring matrix M (described
earlier in the text) to rank each path, favouring the strongest
contextual interpretation. Finally, the algorithm returns the top
scoring paths, along with the chosen label for each node in each
path.

We now turn to describe the labelling of a specific candidate
path, P (Fig. 3). As each node in P is associated with several
labels, the optimization problem at hand is that of selecting an
ordered set of labels, one label per each node in P, such that the
sum of context-transition scores for consecutive labels in this
ordered set is maximized. For this purpose, our method con-
structs for P a directed acyclic graph, denoted the ‘context-
label network’, as follows. Each potential functional label of a
node at index j of P, appears as a contextual-label vertex in the
j-th column of the corresponding context-label network. A dir-
ected edge is added between labels x and y in consecutive col-
umns of the context-label network, and its weight is set to the
context-transition score of the two labels, M(x, y). Additional
‘skip’ edges with constant gap scores are added to the context-
label network, to increase interpretation ﬂexibility by supporting
poor or lacking context annotations of some nodes. Each puta-
tive contextual interpretation of P then corresponds to a directed
path through its context-label network, where the path begins in
one of the vertices of the ﬁrst column, ends in one of the vertices

each column of the context-label network. Our method computes
a heaviest context-labelling path for P Via a dynamic program-
ming algorithm, as described in Section 5.

2.1.4 ContextNet publicly available tool We implemented our
framework as an interactive internet tool and made it publicly
available in http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/ContextNet. Given an input
consisting of source proteins and target genes, our tool enumer-
ates simple paths in the human interactome connecting the two
sets, computes their interpretations and ranks them by their con-
text-labelling scores. The output reports the top-scoring paths
and their contextual interpretation.

3 APPLICATIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK TO THE
INTERPRETATION OF HUMAN SIGNALLING
AND VIRAL INFECTION PATHWAYS

3.1 Known cellular signalling pathways are context
sensitive

Our first step was to validate whether known cellular paths are
context sensitive. For this purpose, we exploited the SPIKE data-
base of manually curated pathway maps, where each map de-
scribes a speciﬁc cellular pathway composed of tens of proteins
(Paz et al., 2011). We applied our framework to 21 of these maps
in a leave-two-out statistical signiﬁcance test. Speciﬁcally, we
computed a context-transition scoring matrix M based on the
paths included in 19 maps, and then used the matrix M and the
label-selection algorithm to calculate the best score for each sig-
nalling path in the two left-out maps. To estimate the statistical
signiﬁcance of the context-labelling score of each path, we re-
peatedly randomized the set of labels associated with each node
and recalculated the path score (see Section 5). If the original
path was not context sensitive, one would expect that its original
score would be similar to its scores based on randomized labels.
However, if the original path was indeed context sensitive, then
its original score would be signiﬁcantly higher than scores based
on randomized labels (P 5 0.05). We found that for paths of
length two edges, 43% of the 195 paths scored signiﬁcantly
better than random. Furthermore, >70% of the 650 paths of
length 3 and >85% of the thousands of paths of length 4e5

colours are used to denote label similarity according to the context-tran-
sition scoring matrix. Edges connect labels corresponding to consecutive
nodes in P, and a dashed edge demonstrates a legitimate context gap
(Skip step). (C) The best-scoring label assignment for P

scored signiﬁcantly better than random (Fig. 4). Based on this,
we conclude that most manually curated signalling paths of
length 375 are indeed context sensitive.

3.2 The context-sensitive framework successfully
identiﬁes proteins associated with inﬂuenza
infection of human cells

During infection, inﬂuenza proteins were shown to interact with
human proteins to recruit the cellular mechanism for Viral pro-
liferation. However, the pathways and the intermediate proteins
involved in the infection process are just beginning to emerge. In
an effort to identify these critical pathways, several large-scale
analyses were recently performed. In particular, (Shapira et al.,
2009) reported a large-scale analysis of inﬂuenza infection of
human primary lung epithelial cells, in which they identiﬁed
PPIs between 10 inﬂuenza proteins and 87 human proteins and
performed extensive mRNA proﬁling of the infected human
cells. Based on these data, Shapira et al. (2009) predicted the
involvement of 1756 human genes in the infection process,
which they tested by RNA silencing. They found that 616 of
the 1756 tested genes were indeed siRNA positive, namely, had
a signiﬁcant effect on Viral propagation and interferon produc-
tion when silenced. Here, we took advantage of this wealth of
information to assess our context-sensitive framework and to
identify potential signalling paths through which Viral proteins
may modify the cellular transcriptional program. To this end, we
calculated the set of all simple paths linking the human interac-
tors of the Viral proteins to each of the human genes exhibiting
differential expression after infection (see Section 5). We then
scored each path using our context-sensitive algorithm, focusing
on paths of length three to ﬁve.

Figure 5A demonstrates the biological relevance of the top 5%
scoring paths compared with a background set consisting of all
paths of same length. The biological relevance was measured by
the percentage of paths that contained at least one connecting
intermediate protein (not source or target) that was found to be
siRNA positive in the experiment described earlier in the text. As

to ﬁve edges are shown. The bars indicate the percentage of paths, per
length, that scored significantly higher than random

shown, in all paths of lengths three to ﬁve, the top-scoring paths
were more likely to include a biologically relevant protein. The
advantage of top-scoring context-sensitive paths was also
observed when compared against shortest paths of similar
lengths (Supplementary Fig. S1). We then extended this analysis
to test whether the context-labelling score was also correlated
with the biological relevance. Indeed, we found that paths of
higher scores were also more likely to contain a connecting bio-
logically relevant protein. Figure 5B shows the correlation for
paths of length four (Pearson r=0.98, P<10—12), and similar
statistically signiﬁcant correlations were obtained for paths of
length three and ﬁve (Supplementary Fig. S2). Figure 5C exem-
pliﬁes a top-ranking path connecting the viral interacting protein
TRAF2 to the differentially expressed gene IRF7. This path
ranked best of the 998 connecting paths for this source and
this target. Notably, two of the three intermediate proteins in
this path were found to be siRNA positive, and the contexts
that our framework selected for them were indeed related to
viral infection as shown in Figure 5C. These results demonstrate
again that our context-sensitive framework helps identify bio-
logically relevant proteins and contexts.

3.3 Highlighting and interpreting the multi-faceted
functionality of the viral protein PB2

The PB2 protein is a subunit of the inﬂuenza virus RNA poly-
merase, and it is known to be a major virulence determinant of
inﬂuenza viruses. It was recently demonstrated that PB2 regu-
lates interferon expression during infection (Graef et al., 2010;
Shapira et al., 2009). However, the molecular mechanisms by
which it acts are just beginning to emerge (Graef et al., 2010).
To illuminate these mechanisms, we applied our framework to
identify and interpret PB2 downstream interactions. Therefore,
we ranked, by context-sensitive scores, the millions of paths con-
necting the 28 human proteins that were found to interact with
PB2 to the 527 target genes that were found to be differentially
expressed during inﬂuenza infection (see Section 5). We com-
bined the 1% top-ranking paths into the network shown in
Figure 6. Importantly, the network we obtained clearly

distribution over all simple paths of length four. Top-scoring paths were
more likely to contain a biologically relevant intermediate protein (Pearson
r = 0.98, P-value < 10‘”). Similar statistically signiﬁcant correlations
were obtained for paths of lengths three and ﬁve (Supplementary
Fig. Sl). (C) A top-ranking path connecting the viral interacting protein
TRAF2 to the differentially expressed gene IRF7. This path ranked best of

intermediate proteins in this path were found to be siRNA positive (red
border). Proteins in the path have closely related labels relevant for infec-
tion, as shown below each protein

highlights the role of PB2 in interferon regulation. The four
human proteins that interact with PB2 through top-ranking
paths were all found as likely upstream regulators of interferon
expression (Fig. 6, red sub-network). Moreover, for ﬁve of the
eight differentially expressed genes in the PB2-induced sub-net-
work, our framework selected interferon-related context labels.
Notably, the assignment of interferon labels to these genes is stat-
istically signiﬁcant, as only 39 of the 527 target genes are asso-
ciated with interferon (Fisher exact test P = 8.2*10‘5). Thus, our
framework correctly uncovered the key downstream effect of PB2
and suggested the cellular pathways by which it acts.

4 DISCUSSION

A well-known limitation of current computational models of PPI
networks is the weak handling of interaction context. PPI net-
work models are typically constructed by combining interactions
from various measurements, regardless of the biological context
in which they were measured, such as speciﬁc stimuli, tissues,
cellular components and disease states. Previous context-sensitive
approaches to network interpretation limited molecular inter-
action pathways to a single context, such as a single tissue or
cell type (Schaefer, 2012), or followed a predeﬁned context-tran-
sition template, e.g. deﬁning a ﬂow from membrane to nucleus

Fig. 6. The PB2 network was computed by merging the top 1% scoring
paths connecting PB2 interactors and genes that were differentially ex-
pressed on infection. Full lines represent direct physical interactions;
dashed lines represent indirect interactions, computed by omitting the
intermediate nodes along the path. Triangle nodes represent transcription
factors, square nodes represent differentially expressed genes and circular
nodes represent direct viral interactors. The labels chosen by our frame-
work are depicted next to nodes. The interferon-labelled nodes are shown
in red, and nodes and edges leading from PB2 to these nodes have a red
border

(Scott et al., 2006). Here, we presented a novel framework that
assigns biological context to molecular interaction pathways
while allowing for context variations and switches that may
not be obvious to the outside observer before our analysis.
Our framework also computes a context-sensitivity score for
the context-annotated pathway, which can be used to prioritize
pathways.

To capture the dynamic context of molecular interaction net-
works, we added another dimension to the PPI network model,
which takes into account, for each node, a set of labels corres-
ponding to its potential functions. We also added edges to con-
nect these labels, and set the weights of these edges to reﬂect the
probability of transitions between the connected labels. The
weights of these transitions were inferred from known human
pathways. Our model is also ﬂexible enough to provide some
support for poorly annotated proteins by leaning on the labels
assigned to their upstream and downstream neighbours. This is
achieved via special skip edges, thus enabling the inclusion and
interpretation of the 16% of the interacting proteins that are not
yet annotated.

The proposed framework can be generalized to handle various
contexts. In this study, we used GO terms as context labels and
known human pathways as guides for constructing the label-
transitionescoring matrix. Our analysis of SPIKE maps revealed
that proteins in known pathways were mostly associated with
G0 biological process terms (76%) and not with molecular func-
tion (14%) or cellular component GO terms (10%). Therefore,
we focused our analysis on GO biological process terms, which
we further filtered to remove high-entropy, loweinformation-
content terms. The remaining terms were associated with a rela-
tively small number of genes (median of 19 genes per term,
including genes associated with descendent terms), indicating
the high speciﬁcity of these terms.

We validated our framework using thousands of known
human pathways. We found that >70% of the known paths of
lengths three to ﬁve edges were indeed context sensitive (Fig. 4).

We proved the use of our framework by applying it to reveal the
molecular interaction paths involved in viral infection. Using our
method, we successfully identiﬁed biologically relevant context-
sensitive paths connecting viral proteins with the downstream
human transcriptional response. We implemented our frame-
work as an interactive internet tool and made it publicly avail-
able in http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/ContextNet.

We have shown the value of introducing GO context to the
analysis of signalling pathways. Future work could include op-
timization variants of this problem that will be applicable to
longer paths and to a wider scope of context. For example, the
current algorithm selects the context of an interaction based on
the context selected for the preceding interaction in the path.
Important extensions would be to reﬂect longer contextual his-
tories that go beyond the first-order neighbourhoods and to
extend the sought context units from linear paths to networks.
Another extension would be to integrate additional context
schemes, such as pathway context enrichment (Pandey et al.,
2007), network schemas (Banks et al., 2008), semantic similarity
(Pesquita et al., 2009), tissue associations (Barshir et al., 2013) or
protein localization (Scott et al., 2006), and to enhance them with
interaction-conﬁdence scores. The new framework we presented
and its extensions may be applied to a variety of network-related
problems where context-sensitive relationships are meaningful.

5 METHODS

5.1 Human interactome model

Experimentally detected human undirected PPIs were assembled
from four major PPI databases, including BIOGRID (Stark
et al., 2011), DIP (Salwinski et al., 2004), IntAct (Aranda
et al., 2010) and MINT (Ceol et al., 2010). Directed transcription
regulation interactions between transcription factors and their
target genes were downloaded from the TRANSFAC database
(Matys et al., 2006). We also included manually curated directed
and undirected interactions from the SPIKE database (Paz et al.,
2011). GO terms and annotated human proteins and genes were
downloaded from the GO database (Ashburner et al., 2000),
February 2012 release. To increase the speciﬁcity and reliability
of the GO data used in this study, we filtered out GO terms
assigned to >600 genes and GO annotations with evidence
codes IPI, NAS and ND. Each GO term was denoted by a dis-
tinct label 1.

5.2 Learning the label-transition scoring matrix M

To study the frequency of label transitions in signalling paths, we
exploited the manually curated pathway maps from the SPIKE
database (Paz et al., 2011). From each map we extracted the set
of all simple paths linking a protein to a gene with the last edge in
the path being a transcription regulation edge. We then directed
each path from the upstream protein to its downstream target
gene, and combined all paths per map into one set of unique
directed edges. For each node v, we denote as L, the set of all
labels of v (GO annotations in this study). For each edge (u, v) in
some path, and for each x 6 Lu and y 6 L,, we computed the
label pairwise frequency by counting how many times y appears

A context-sensitive framework

 

consisting of pairs of consecutive labels, annotated by their
frequencies.

We observed that some labels in P are non-speciﬁc, for ex-
ample, ‘Transcription Factor activity’, which always appears as
the target node in every edge pointing to a transcription factor.
Therefore, we applied an entropy measurement criterion to filter
out non-speciﬁc labels from F (i.e. labels with high entropy). For
this, we calculated for every ordered pair, (x, y) e F, the forward
conditional probability P(y | x) = (Occurrences of y after
x)/(Total occurrences of x), as well as the backward conditional
probability P(x | y) = (Occurrences of x prior to y)/(Total occur-
rences of y). It is important to note that P(x | y) and P(y | x) are
not necessarily the same. Therefore, for each label x, we com-
puted its forward individual entropy h(Y| x) across all occur-
rences of consecutive label pairs (x, y) e F, as
h(Y| x) = Zer—P(y|x)log(P(y|x)). Note that, in the afore-
mentioned formulation, x is a speciﬁc label (thus denoted by a
lowercase letter) and Y is a random variable (thus denoted by an
uppercase letter). All pairs (x, y) e F, such that the forward in-
dividual entropy of label x was found to exceed a threshold (0.7),
were ﬁltered out from F. Similarly, we calculated the backward
individual entropy h(X | y) = Exex —P(x| t)log(P(x| t)) for
each label y and ﬁltered out all pairs (x, y) e F such that
the backward individual entropy of label y was found to
exceed a threshold (0.7). In-between filtration steps, both
individual and pairwise label frequencies were re-calculated
based on the remaining labels in F. Finally, we set
M(x, y) = log10(l — P(y | x)), for all (x,y) e F.

We used 1428 terms, covering 7001 genes, which constitute
48.7% of the interactome. These terms were then filtered based
on their entropy, leaving 1203 terms covering 5919 genes, which
are 41.2% of the interactome. To examine the level (within the
GO hierarchy) of terms that is useful for context deﬁnition, we
computed the size of each GO term appearing in M. The size of a
GO term was deﬁned as the number of genes associated with it,
including the genes associated with its descendant GO terms. We
found that the GO terms in the entropy-ﬁltered M had a median
size of 19 genes. This indicates that GO terms that have a small
size, and, therefore, are low level, are more informative than
high-level, non-speciﬁc terms that are associated with many
genes. The G0 terms participating in M, their entropy and the
number of genes they cover, are provided in the ContextNet
website at: http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/ContextNet/SuppTable1.xlsx.

5.3 The dynamic programming algorithm for path
interpretation

To compute the strongest contextual interpretation of paths
from the PPI graph, our algorithm uses the pre-computed con-
text-transition scoring matrix M computed as described in the
previous section. Given, as input, a path P and the context-tran-
sition scoring matrix M, the algorithm computes an output con-
sisting of the score for the strongest contextual interpretation of
P, as well as the corresponding annotation of the nodes of P, in
form of a sequence of pairs <(S,€S),(v2,€2)..(vk,€k),(T,€,)>,
where S denotes the source node, T denotes the target node
and 1,- denotes the label assigned to node v,- in P, selected from
among all possible context labels suggested for node v,-.

To this end, a ‘context-label network’ is constructed for P, as
described in the Section 2, in the form of a directed acyclic grid
graph G/ (see Fig. 3 for an illustration), where the j-th column of
vertices in 0 (presented in the ﬁgure under the corresponding j-
th node of P) represents all the potential context labels for that
node.

We define two edge types within the possible context transi-
tions. A Switch edge represents a transition from label x to label
y in an adjacent column in G’; it is added to the graph if the
context-transition score of the ordered pair of labels it connects is
above a given threshold, and its weight is set to M (x, y). A Skip
edge (shown in dashed lines in the figure), skips over an adjacent
column in the grid to a label in the next one. A Skip edge con-
nects two similar labels: x in column i of G/ and y in column i + 2
of G’, if column i +1 does not contain any label z such that
M (x, z)> Threshold. The weight of the Skip edge is set to
M(x, y) + SkipPenalty. When reconstructing an optimal solution
interpreting P (i.e. the optimal context-label assignments to the
nodes of P), the skipped node is assigned the same label as the
one chosen for the source node of the skip edge (for example, in
Figure 3C, node v is green even though it does not have a green
label in its column). The Skip edge allows us to deal with poorly
annotated genes and to suggest an overall context-acceptable
path interpretation.

We can now reduce the problem of label assignment to that of
ﬁnding the heaviest path in an edge-weightededirected acyclic
graph, with a predeﬁned constraint dmax on the maximum
number of Skip edges allowed. Dynamic programming is then
applied to solve the reduced problem, implementing the recur-
sion later in the text (Fig. 7), where x and y denote label nodes
in G’, Predecessors(y) denotes the set of vertices that have
edges leading to y in G’, and Labels(v) denotes the set of
labels of v. The final context-labelling score is reported as
maxyeLabels(T)S(ys dmax)-

The dynamic programming algorithm traverses all the nodes
in the context-label network (G’) in increasing column order and
applies the recursion given in Figure 7 to compute the score for
each label node. Therefore, the time and space requirements of
the dynamic programming algorithm implementing this recur-
sion is 0(E + V), where E and V denote the number of edges
and vertices in G’, respectively.

5.4 Evaluating the context sensitivity of known cellular
paths in SPIKE

We conducted 10 trials as follows. In each trial, we computed a
context-transition scoring matrix as described earlier in the text
by using 19 of the 21 SPIKE maps. We then used the matrix to

calculate the score of paths extracted from the two left-out maps.
To test the signiﬁcance of the score of each path, we shufﬂed the
label assignments between nodes in the human interactome and
re-scored the path. We repeated the randomization 40 times per
path. Paths whose original score was better than the score ob-
tained in at least 38 of the 40 shufﬂes (P 5 0.05) were considered
statistically signiﬁcant and were marked as successful paths.

5.5 Inferring inﬂuenza infection pathways

We extracted from (Shapira et al., 2009) the following data sets:
(i) the 36 human proteins that interact with inﬂuenza proteins
and that are annotated with a GO term that appeared in M,
which we denoted as sources; (ii) the 527 infection-related differ-
entially expressed genes (as defined in Shapira et al.) that are
connected to at least one of the source proteins, which we
denote as targets; and (iii) 1756 genes that were silenced and
their effect on infection was measured, which we denote as
siRNA positive. Using our framework, we identiﬁed and
scored all paths of lengths three to ﬁve edges in the interactome
that connect these sources to these targets. We did not consider
paths of length two because only 40% of them were context-
sensitive according to the SPIKE analysis (Fig. 4). We used a
context-sensitive scoring matrix M that we computed based on
all SPIKE maps. Annotations based on IEA evidence codes,
which are less reliable, were considered to increase the number
of annotated genes in the interactome; however, they were
weighted 50% lower than annotations based on other evidence
codes. We then counted the fraction of paths per length that
contained a predicted intermediate protein (other than the
source and target) that was found to be siRNA positive.

5.6 PB2 analysis

We computed all paths connecting the 28 annotated human pro-
teins that interact with PB2 (source proteins) and to the 527
differentially expressed genes that are on a path of length <6
edges from a source protein (target genes). The annotation of 39
of the 527 differentially expressed genes was associated with
interferon.

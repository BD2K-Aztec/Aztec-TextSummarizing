Fig. 1. An example output from the plotsquiggle function. Plotted are the events data extracted from a single read. The y-axis is the mean electronic

signal reported for the pore, and the X-axis is time in seconds

key summary statistics, such as maximum, minimum and mean read
lengths.

2.3 FASTQ and FASTA extraction

Once the data are organized, users may wish to extract FASTQ/A data.
This can be done using the extractrunfaitqﬂ and extract.runfasta()
functions. For each FAST5 read in a given directory, this function will
extract the template, complement and 2D FASTQ/A data where they
exist and write these to individual FASTQ/A ﬁles.

2.4 Data exploration

We provide a number of functions that allow users to explore the data
visually. Histograms of read length can be created using the
plot.length.hiit0gram() function. This plots histograms for the template,
complement and 2D read lengths (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The plot.cumulative.yield() function can be used to plot cumulative
yield of the run over time, and sums up the template, complement and
2D read lengths over time in seconds since the analysis began
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

Finally, the MinION device consists of a number of channels, each of
which should contain a single nanopore. Users can count and plot the
number of reads per channel for a run, using plot.channel.reads(), and
sum and plot the yield per channel, using plot.channel.yield(). Both of
these can be potentially used to diagnose problems in particular areas of
the ﬂowcell.

2.5 Extracting and plotting events

The raw data from the MinION are the information about the electronic
signal measured as each single molecule of DNA passes through the
protein nanopore. It is these data that are converted to sequence data
by the metrichor agent. However, the raw events data are also available
and can be extracted using the function get.events(). This will extract the
thousands of events for both the template and complement for a particu-
lar read. The events data may then be visualized using the plotsquiggld)
function (see Fig. l).

3 DISCUSSION

We have written poRe, an R package that enables users to more
easily manipulate, summarize and visualize MinION nanopore

sequencing data. As a package for R, poRe is available for both
Windows and Linux, and crucially the Windows version will
allow data analysis on the mandatory Windows laptop on
which the MinION depends. In addition, R is now a popular
statistical package among biologists, who may feel comfortable
using poRe through the R user interface.

poRe is one of the first bioinformatics packages to offer this
necessary functionality. poretools (Loman and Quinlan, 2014), a
toolkit written in Python, offers similar functionality, although
each software has a different set of (overlapping) functions. A
table comparing feature sets is available in the Supplementary
Information. The cross—platform nature of poRe, its ease of
installation and poRe’s ability to organize folders of FAST5
ﬁles make poRe an important tool for users of the MinION
device.

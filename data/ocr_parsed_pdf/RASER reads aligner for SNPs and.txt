Abstract

Motivation: Accurate identification of genetic variants such as single—nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) or RNA editing sites from RNA—Seq reads is important, yet challenging, because it necessi—
tates a very low false—positive rate in read mapping. Although many read aligners are available, no
single aligner was specifically developed or tested as an effective tool for SNP and RNA editing
prediction.

Results: We present RASER, an accurate read aligner with novel mapping schemes and index tree
structure that aims to reduce false—positive mappings due to existence of highly similar regions.
We demonstrate that RASER shows the best mapping accuracy compared with other popular
algorithms and highest sensitivity in identifying multiply mapped reads. As a result, RASER dis—
plays superb efficacy in unbiased mapping of the alternative alleles of SNPs and in identification of
RNA editing sites.

1 Introduction

High—throughput RNA—sequencing (RNA—Seq) data are now indis—
pensable in a wide range of biological and medical research areas,
such as gene expression, gene regulation and functional studies of
genetic abnormalities. As a result, accurate read alignment tools are
highly desirable. Although many short read aligners exist, detection
of single—nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or dele—
tions (indels) harbored in the short RNA—Seq reads remains a very
challenging task. Such applications require very low false—positive
rate in read mapping to avoid calling spurious variants in the reads.
In addition, different from studies of genetic variants using whole—
genome sequencing data, a challenge specific to RNA—Seq is to
accurately quantify the expression levels of alternative alleles of the
variants based on RNA—Seq reads. For example, in studies of allele—
specific expression (ASE) of single—nucleotide polymorphisms

(SNPs), the expression levels of the two alleles of each SNP are
quantified based on the number of mapped reads to determine
whether a significant allelic bias (i.e. ASE) exists. A well—known
issue is the mapping bias that favors reads harboring the reference
allele (identical to the reference genome used for read alignment) of
heterozygous SNPs (Degner et (11., 2009; Heap et (11., 2010; Pastinen,
2010). This problem is only partially alleviated if the reference
genome is modified to encompass alternative SNP alleles that are
known to exist in the specific dataset, making expensive whole—
genome sequencing a necessity (Degner et (11., 2009; Smith et (11.,
2013). In general, read alignment accuracy remains a fundamental
limiting factor for quantification of ASEs.

A similar problem exists in studies of RNA editing. Recently, an
increasing number of reports focused on identification of RNA edit—
ing sites using RNA—Seq data (reviewed in Lee et (11., 2013). It is

now well established that read mapping inaccuracy can lead to
many false—positive predictions (Kleinman and Majewski, 2012; Lee
et (11., 2013; Lin et (11., 2012; Pickrell et (11., 2012). To increase
editing prediction efficacy, strategies to combine multiple read align—
ers and apply a series of artifact filtering steps were utilized (Lee
et (11., 2013). Although many short read aligners are available
(Engstrom et (11., 2013) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_
sequence_alignment_software), no single aligner was specifically
developed or tested as an effective tool for SNP and RNA editing
prediction.

In our previous studies of ASE and RNA editing (Bahn et (11.,
2012; Li et (11., 2012; Zhang and Xiao, 2015), we developed a read
mapping pipeline that makes use of multiple read alignment tools
and applies stringent requirements on the allowed mismatches of
mapped reads. Specifically, it combines the alignment results of
Bowtie (Langmead et (11., 2009), BLAT (Kent, 2002) and TopHat
(Trapnell et (11., 2009) and applies two types of filters to retain reads
that map uniquely with $711 mismatches and do not mapped to any
other genomic loci with $712 mismatches (711 < 712). We showed that
this ‘double—filtering’ scheme is effective in reducing potential map—
ping bias or artifacts related to the presence of alternative sequence
variants or homologous regions in the genome (Bahn et (11., 2012;
Lee et (11., 2013; Li et (11., 2012). However, this pipeline demands
long CPU time and large hard drive space due to the usage of mul—
tiple read aligners and stringent mismatch filters.

Here, we present RASER (reads aligner for SNPs and editing
sites of RNA) that is specifically designed for applications of RNA—
Seq in studies involving SNPs, RNA editing or other types of SNVs.
Since RASER is a standalone application, processing time and hard
drive demand are greatly reduced compared with our previous read
mapping strategy. A distinctive feature of RASER is its interrogation
of a large number of mapping positions for each read using a novel
tree structure that reduces ambiguity in mapping repeated sub—
sequences, thus increasing mapping accuracy. The comprehensive
search of many possible mapping positions of each read enables a
comparative analysis of these alignments and elimination of ambigu—
ous results likely due to existence of homologous regions in the gen—
ome. Built upon this strength, RASER further adopts a novel
mismatch filtering scheme named ‘obviously best’ which aims to
maximize mapping rate while maintaining high mapping accuracy.

Using both simulated and actual RNA—Seq datasets, we demon—
strate that RASER shows the best mapping precision compared with
other popular read mapping algorithms. The performance of
RASER remains high for both short and long reads, which is also ro—
bust to mismatches and indels in the reads. Importantly, RASER
shows superb efficacy in unbiased mapping of the alternative alleles
of SNPs and in identification of RNA editing sites.

2 Methods
2.1 Building index

The index is a data structure that stores positions of specific nucleo—
tide sequences within the reference and returns them during the read
alignment search. For most DNA or RNA—Seq read aligners that re—
quire an index of the reference sequence, efficient storing and load—
ing of the index are among the most important factors that facilitate
accurate and fast alignment. One of the key features of the RASER
index is that the length of indexed reference sub—sequence increases
as it occurs more frequently in the reference, which reduces ambigu—
ity in mapping of a read from the repeated regions. This feature en—
ables reduction of processing time while maintaining sensitivity to
resolve repetitive or homologous regions.

eters with default values 8 and 4, respectively. Nodes of level (Iv) n (n>0)
store positions of sequences of length (s+ n) within the reference. For ex-
ample, the positions of ‘AACTGCT‘I‘I” are stored in the lv1 node (which is a
leaf node). The node is a leaf node if the number of stored positions is <32 or
the maximum number of levels (16) is reached. See text for details

RASER index is composed of 4‘ trees as shown in Figure 1 where
s is the predefined length of sequences corresponding to the root
node (5 : 8 in Fig. 1). The trees in the index have several properties.
First, the root node of each tree is assigned with quaternary numbers
to represent its associated sequence, where A : 0, C : 1, G : 2 and
T : 3. We denote this quaternary number as qnum hereafter. A node
with qnum N can have four child nodes whose qnums are
(N x 4 +0) N (N x 4+3). For example, if qnum of a node is GAC
( : 2014), then its child nodes have qnums GACA ( : 20104), GACC
(220114), GACG ( 220124) and GACT ( 220134).

Second, the tree structure is intuitively defined in terms of levels.
For example, the level of a root node is defined as 0, and its child
node is defined as level 1 and so on. The maximum level of a tree is
set to be 16. The level of a node can thus be calculated as (number
of digit of qnum — 5).

Third, a terminal or leaf node with qnum : N and level: 11
stores positions of all reference sequences whose first (11 +5) nucleo—
tides are calculated as N. A node is a terminal or leaf node if it
stores£32 reference positions or its level reaches the maximum
11 : 16. Nodes that do not meet the leaf node definition are split into
four child nodes, according to qnums calculated from the first
(v+$ + 1) nucleotides of the sequences. For example, a node with
qnum ‘GAC’ stores positions of ‘GAC. . . ’ within the reference se—
quence if it is a leaf node. If the number of stored positions is >32
and the level is <16, positions of ‘GACA . . . ’, ‘GACC . . . ’,
‘GACG . . . ’ and ‘GACT. . . ’ are stored to the child nodes (if they are
leaf nodes) whose qnums are ‘GACA’, ‘GACC’, ‘GACG’ and
‘GACT’, respectively.

According to the properties described above, the reference se—
quence of length (5 + 16) at every [2 bases are indexed to the trees,
where k is a user parameter whose default value is 4 (see below).
The indexing process starts with trees whose qnum is equal to its
first 5 bases and the tree branches are extended according to the
rules defined above. The structure of the index and its building pro—
cedure are brieﬂy illustrated in Figure 1.

The variable 5 is a user—defined parameter with a default value 8,
which is recommended for the human genome. For genomes with
smaller size, the value of s can be reduced. In general, a smaller 5
leads to smaller index sizes. However, if s is too small, alignment
may become inefficient because smaller s leads to a decrease in the
total number of nodes in the index tree and thus increases ambiguity
in the mapping of reads originated from repetitive regions. The vari—
able k is also a user parameter. Smaller [2 leads to larger index but
can enable more accurate mapping. We recommend setting [2 to 4
for the human genome. It should be noted that the maximum level
of the tree and the maximum number of positions stored in the
nodes are fixed as 16 and 32, respectively. These variables are not
user—defined parameters, because their optimal values are not sensi—
tive to application—specific parameters such as the size of the refer—
ence genome or read length.

Using the above indexing scheme, two or more heterogeneous
types of references, such as the genome and transcriptome, can be
indexed together. The size of the index file is about 5.7 GB for hg19
only and 6 GB for hg19 and Encode transcriptome, using default
user parameters. For all applications included in this article, an
index of hg19 was used.

2.2 Read mapping

The first step to map a read is to apply a sliding window on the read
sequence with a window size of (s + 16) and a step size of 1. Next, a
root node is identified whose qnnm is the same as the first 5 bases of
the windowed (5+ 16) read sequence. The tree branch of this root
node that matches the ensuing nucleotides of the read sequence is then
identified up to the leaf node. If assuming the level of the leaf node is
n, positions stored in this leaf node correspond to reference sequences
identical to the first (5 + n) bases of the windowed read sequence. If a
windowed read sequence contains ‘N’, it is ignored. This process is
illustrated in Figure 2a. Note that if reference positions of all the win—
dows of a read (pair) are obtained from leaf nodes (which may have
far more than 32 reference positions), RASER terminates the mapping
process and reports this read (pair) as unmapped. This ‘early termin—
ation’ procedure aims to reduce mapping time. Since such reads map
to many positions in the reference, they will not be useful for applica—
tions that seek for unique or ‘obviously best’ mappings such as in the

detection of SNPs or RNA editing sites. Thus, this procedure does not
reduce the amount of final usable reads.

Once the positions of a windowed read sequence are obtained, we
extend these initial mappings as illustrated in Figure 2b. Such an ex—
tension is performed in both backward and forward directions. The
pseudo—code for this process is given in Figure 2c. The variable mr
(mismatch ratio) is a user—defined parameter with a default value of
0.08. The maximum total number of mismatches, insertions and dele—
tions allowed in a mapped read is calculated as ‘read length x mr’. A
score is calculated for each read position in the extension regions to
represent the goodness of match of the extended read sequence (Fig.
2c). Mismatches (nmis) increase this score, but the score can still be
small if the mapping size (: len) is large enough. In contrast, inser—
tions or deletions are not considered in the extension step to avoid an
inﬂation of the score due to possible existence of ensuing mismatches
after indels. In the example shown in Figure 2b, read positions 6—14
were initially mapped to chr1 :49 362—49 370 based on the index tree,
which are marked in blue. Following backward and forward exten—
sion, read positions 1—25 was mapped to chr1:49 357—49 381.
Hereafter, we denote this mapped sequence as a fragment.

After getting all the fragments of a read, the next step is to merge
the fragments. If there are no insertions, deletions or clustered mis—
matches, many identical fragments are generated from the read.
These duplicated fragments are discarded. For the remaining frag-
ments, multiple scenarios may exist that call for different merging
methods. Given two fragments ‘chrzA—B, a—b’ and ‘chr:C—D, c—d’
where A < D, the distance between them is C — B. If this distance is
less than or equal to ‘read length x mr’, we assume that there are
short deletions in the read relative to the reference and merge these
fragments into a contiguous mapped region as in Figure 2d.
Otherwise, we assume that the read spans an intron or large inser—
tions in the reference and merge the fragments as illustrated in
Figure 2e. For the latter case, RASER determines the best alignment
using the known GT—AG or GC—AG splicing site sequences. If splice
site signals are not found, the best alignment that results in the least
number of mismatches and indels is chosen using the Smith—
Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981). The maximum
intron length is assumed to be 200 000 nt.

Fetching positions from the index is indeed an exact mapping pro—
cess between windowed sequence of a read and positions within the

9103 ‘Og JSanV uo seleﬁuv soc] ‘BtHJOJtIBQ JO AJtsreAtuf] 112 /3.IO'S[BIIJI’IOI’pJOJXO"SOIJBHIJOJIIIOIq/ﬂdnq 11101} pepeolumoq

reference, since this step does not allow mismatches or indels.
However, given the sliding read window and the merging process of
fragments, RASER is ﬂexible enough to allow mismatches and indels.

The score of an alignment is defined as ‘the number of mis—
matches and indels/read length’. Only alignments with scores 3 mr
are reported (after read pairing if the sequencing data are paired
end). Note that we apply the above mapping procedure to a read se—
quence and its reverse complement sequence separately.

2.3 Additional mapping schemes

The ‘double—filtering’ scheme (Bahn et al., 2012) is internally imple—
mented in RASER and is an option that can be turn on or off by the
user. As mentioned in Section 1, it is a mapping scheme where a
read (pair) should be uniquely mapped with score less than or equal
to mr and not mapped to anywhere in the reference with score more
than df which is another user—defined parameter. Because a read
(pair) with multiple aligned positions with less than ‘read length x
mr’ mismatches is filtered out (failing the uniqueness requirement),
it is not necessary to search for all the candidate mapping positions
once two such alignments are reached, which leads to an accelerated
alignment process.

RASER also implements an alternative new mapping scheme,
namely ‘obviously best’, as an optional scheme to the user. By defin—
ition, this scheme finds the ‘obviously’ best mapping of a read (pair),
whose mismatch score is less than or equal to mr and also less than
scores of all other mappings by ob which is a user—defined param—
eter. Different from double filtering, this scheme necessitates a
search of all possible candidate mappings with the larger mismatch
ratio (mr + ob). This additional step somewhat slows down the
alignment process but maximizes the mapping rate and minimizes
false—positive mappings, as detailed in Section 3.

3 Results

3.1 Description of the experimental settings

We evaluated RASER using both simulated and actual RNA—Seq
datasets. For simulated reads, we used BEER (Grant et al., 2011) to
generate 1 million (M) paired—end reads of length 50, 100, 150 and
200 bases, respectively, each with three settings (thus, a total of 12
sets of simulated reads). The three settings (named SIM1, SIM2 and
SIM3) represent three levels of sequencing errors: with a substitution
rate of 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01 and an indel rate of 0.0005, 0.0025
and 0.005, respectively. Thus, SIM3 corresponds to the largest level
of sequencing errors. The simulation used transcript annotations
combining 10 annotation tracks including UCSC, RefSeq, RefSeq—
Other, Ensembl, Vega, AceView, GenScan, GeneID, NSCAN and
SGP (http://cbil.upenn.edu/BEERS/).

For real RNA—Seq data, we used three datasets referred to as
GM12878, K562 and YH. The first two datasets were obtained by
the ENCODE project that includes a total of 223M and 213M
paired—end reads (2 X 76 nt) of the human lymphoblastoid and K562
cell line (polyA + cytoplasmic RNA), respectively (ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2012). The third dataset YH was derived from lympho—
blastoid cells of a Chinese individual (Peng et al., 2012) encompass—
ing a total of 131M paired—end (2 X 75 nt) and 30M paired—end
(2 X 100 nt) reads (polyA +RNA).

For both simulated and real datasets, we compared the perform—
ance of RASER with three state—of—the—art reads aligners, STAR
2.3.0 (Dobin et al., 2013), Tophat 2.0.9 (Kim et al., 2013) and
GSNAP 2014—01—21 (Wu and Nacu, 2010). We also included
NOVOALIGN (http://www.novocraft.com/products/novoalignl) in

some analyses of simulated datasets. For all aligners, we used default
parameters except that the maximum number of allowed mis—
matches was set to be 4 per 50 bases of read (e.g. mr:0.05 for
RASER). Specific to RASER, we used —d 0.09 for ‘double—filtering’
and —b 0.03 for the ‘obviously best’ mapping scheme. Unless other—
wise noted, we used RASER with the ‘obviously best’ mapping
scheme. For other aligners, unique mapping results were reported
for all datasets. All read alignments were carried out against the
human reference genome (hg19). Mapping results for all datasets
are included in Supplementary Table S1.

3.2 Comparison of mapping performance

First, we compared mapping accuracy of different aligners using the
12 sets of simulated reads as described above (Fig. 3a). Mapping ac—
curacy (i.e. precision) is defined as the percentage of correctly
mapped among all mapped reads. A read is considered correctly
mapped if more than 80% (Fig. 3a) or 50% (Supplementary Fig.
S1a) of its nucleotides are mapped to their true positions. RASER, in
its default mode (‘obviously best’ scheme, aka, OB), shows highest
precision for all simulated datasets. The precision of RASER im—
proves for longer reads, which is not observed for GSNAP or STAR.
In addition, the precision of RASER is robust to sequencing errors,
whereas that of GSNAP or STAR deteriorates as sequencing error
increases. It should be noted that the precision of STAR is relatively
low (Fig. 3a) in this analysis due to excessive soft clipping.
However, its precision improves significantly if a lower % of
mapped nucleotides per read is required to call a correct mapping
(comparing Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S1a). In general,
Tophat2 is quite accurate and robust to sequencing errors, possibly
at the cost of recall (see below).

RASER out—performs the second best aligner in precision by
0.1 ~ 0.5% which may appear to be small. However, incorrectly
mapped reads are enriched with those that lead to false positive or in—
accurate quantification of nucleotide variants (e.g. SNPs or RNA editing
sites). The advantage of RASER in these aspects is demonstrated below.

In an alternative mode that only retains uniquely mapped reads
(instead of OB), RASER again out—performs the others for most
simulated datasets, especially those with larger sequencing errors or
longer read length (Supplementary Fig. S1b and c). Since we imple—
ment three alternative mismatch filtering schemes [OB, unique (U),
and double filtering (DF)], we compared the performance of RASER
with these three schemes. The OB scheme shows superior mapping
precision than the other two schemes (Supplementary Fig. S1d) but
smaller recall (Supplementary Fig. S1e).

Another measure to evaluate the performance of aligners is re—
call, defined as the percentage of mapped reads (unique and non—
unique) among all reads. In this comparison, GSNAP shows the
highest recall values (Fig. 3b). Recall of RASER is lower compared
with GSNAP or STAR but much higher than that of Tophat2. The
lower recall of RASER is (at least partly) due to the early termin—
ation procedure described in Section 2 where reads expected to be
mapped to many genomic positions are not reported.

NOVOALIGN is another often—used aligner. Since it does not
directly map spliced junction reads, we excluded such reads in the
simulated datasets to enable a fair comparison. NOVOALIGN
shows relatively good recall but generally worse precision than other
algorithms (Supplementary Fig. S1f—h). Given its suboptimal preci—
sion and the limitation in handling spliced junction reads, we did
not include NOVOALIGN in further analyses.

A distinctive feature of RASER is manifested as the highest rate
of multiple mappings (defined as the percentage of multiply mapped

reads/total number of mapped junction reads). Recall is defined as (number of correctly mapped junction reads/total number of reads with junctions implanted in
each simulated dataset). (f) The numbers of novel and annotated junctions detected by each aligner in real RNA-Seq dataset. Annotated splice junctions were
defined as those that match perfectly or with less than 5 base difference to Genecode v19 annotation. Novel splice junctions were defined as those that were not
included in the Gencode v19 annotation. For each junction, we required a minimum read coverage of 3 and a preference for canonical GT-AG or GC-AG splice

sites

reads among all reads), which is often twice as high as those of other
aligners (Supplementary Fig. S1i). In a related analysis, we compared
the rate of multiply mapped reads among those reads that are origi—
nated from repeats in the reference genome (Fig. 3c). RASER again
shows better performance than other aligners in capturing such non—
unique reads. By design, RASER aims to identify as many mapping
positions as possible for each read. This feature is important for
reducing false—positive mappings when combined with the ‘double—
filtering’ or ‘obviously best’ schemes, as it allows comparison of all
or almost all possible mapped positions of a read. Since mapping of
reads harboring SNPs or RNA editing sites is often complicated by
the presence of highly similar regions across the genome, this feature
of RASER enables improved performance in handling nucleotide
variants in the reads, as demonstrated below.

To evaluate the performance of different aligners against real
RNA—Seq data without ground truth, we examined the number of
reads mapped to the Y chromosome (cth) in RNA—Seq data
derived from female cells: GM12878 and K5 62. Because of the ab—
sence of a Y chromosome in these cells, reads mapped to cth
should be considered as false—positive mappings. In this case,
RASER (OB mode) out—performs the other aligners (unique map—
ping) considerably and yields the lowest number of false—positive
mappings and lowest rate of false positives (defined as the ratio

between the number of reads mapped to cth and total number of
mapped reads) (Fig. 3d). The high false—positive rates of the other
aligners suggests that the Y chromosome harbors regions that have
sequence similarity to other chromosomes in the genome, which is
exacerbated by possible structural variations in the cancer cells
(K5 62). The superior performance of RASER roots from its effect—
iveness in identifying and handling non—uniquely mapped reads
when combined with the OB mismatch filtering scheme and its high
precision in general.

Lastly, we evaluated the performance of RASER in identifying
spliced junction reads resulted from RNA splicing. Two evaluation
metrics were calculated: recall (defined as the number of correctly
mapped junction reads/total number of reads with junctions im—
planted in each simulated dataset) and false discovery rate (FDR,
defined as the number of false—positive junction reads/total number
of mapped junction reads identified by an aligner). As shown in
Figure 3e, RASER has the lowest FDR for simulated reads of all
lengths, with comparable or lower recall than other aligners.
Applied to real RNA—Seq datasets, RASER demonstrates the highest
recall rates [defined as the number of perfectly or partially matched
junctions/total number of junctions in Gencode (v19) annotation]
for two of the three datasets (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition,
RASER also identifies the largest number of annotated spliced

junctions in these datasets (Fig. 3f). Based on the above results for
both simulated and real datasets, RASER is advantageous in iden—
tifying spliced junction reads.

3.3 Quantification of single—nucleotide

expression in RNA—Seq

To evaluate the performance of RASER in quantifying SNVs in
RNA—Seq reads, we implanted known SNPs (from the YH and
GM12878 genomes) to the SIM1, SIM2 and SIM3 reads (read
length being 50, 100, 150 and 200 nts). For each read that contains
a known SNP, the probability for the SNP to have the reference or
alternative allele was set to be 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 (ratio defined as
the number of reads containing the reference allele/total number of
reads covering the SNP). Following read mapping, customized
post—mapping filters were applied prior to calculation of allelic
ratios, including removal of duplicated mappings, removal of reads
where the mismatches (corresponding to SNPs) were (i) within 5 nt
of read ends or (ii) with Sanger base quality less than 30, and re—
moval of SNPs with less than 5 reads. We calculated allelic ratios
for the remaining mismatches. Subsequently, we calculated for
each SNP the absolute difference between its simulated allelic ratio
and the observed allelic ratio from mapped reads, where allelic
ratio is defined in the same way as described above (number of
reads containing the reference allelejtotal number of reads covering
the SNP). Thus, larger allelic ratio differences reflect increased
mapping bias to the alternative alleles of the simulated SNP. At dif—
ferent thresholds of allelic ratio difference (0—0.2), we determined
the FDR of SNP quantification as FP/(FP +TP), where FF and TP
are numbers of false and true positives, respectively. At each
threshold, a given SNP is defined as a true positive if its allelic ratio
difference is less than the threshold; otherwise, this SNP is a false
positive.

In this comparison, RASER offers the smallest FDR among all
aligners tested for 55 cases among 72 cases (76%) (Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Fig. S3). FDR of TOPHAT2 was smaller than
RASER for 12 out of 18 cases of 50 nt read sets and GSNAP yielded
smaller FDR than RASER for 5 out of the remaining 54 cases, but
the differences were subtle. It is expected that aligners often have
mapping bias favoring the reference allele. Consistent with this ex—
pectation, FDR was generally lower for 0.75 (higher proportion of
the reference allele) compared with that for 0.25 (smaller proportion
of the reference allele). More importantly, we observed that the dif—
ference in FDR between RASER and the second best aligner in—
creases as allelic probability decreases, which confirms that RASER
is less biased to reference allele. In addition, the allelic ratios resulted
from RASER are not significantly different from simulated ratios for
any dataset (P value > 0.05, Kolmogorov—Smirnov test) except two
cases (SIM3 of Supplementary Fig. S4q and 11), whereas other align—
ers often lead to significant deviations of allelic ratios from the
ground truth (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Applied to real RNA—Seq datasets, RASER also demonstrates su—
perior performance in reducing mapping bias to alternative alleles of
SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S5a and c). Using the two datasets derived
from cells with whole—genome sequencing data (GM12878 and
YH), we observed that the average allelic ratio of SNPs is closest to
the expected 0.5 (ratio defined as number of reads containing the
reference allele/total number of reads) for reads mapped by RASER.
In contrast, the results from GSNAP, TOPHAT2 and STAR are
more biased toward the reference allele (>0.5), which is a known
issue where read mapping favors the reference allele of heterozygous
SNPs since the reference genome was used.

Fig. 4. FDR in the quantification of allelic ratios of SNPs expressed in RNA-
Seq. SNPs were implanted in SIM1 data of (a) 100, (b) 150 bases in length.
SNPs in the YH (left panels) or GM12878 samples (right panels), both of which
had corresponding whole-genome sequencing data, were implanted into the
simulated reads. The ‘obviously best' scheme was used for RASER and
unique mapping was reported from the other aligners. For a specific SNP, its
allelic ratio is defined as (number of reads containing the reference allele/total
number of reads covering the SNP). The allelic ratio difference of this SNP is
defined as the absolute difference between its observed allelic ratio and the
simulated allelic ratio. At different thresholds of allelic ratio difference (0—0.2,
X axis), the FDR of SNP quantification is defined as FP/(FP+TP), where FF
and TP are numbers of false and true positives, respectively. At each thresh-
old, a given SNP is defined as a true positive if its allelic ratio difference is
less than the threshold; otherwise, this SNP is a false positive

The above analyses used the same customized post—mapping fil—
ters as described for simulated reads. As an alternative method for
SNP filtering, we used GATK with default parameters (DePristo
et al., 2011) to call SNPs based on the mapping results of each
aligner in analyzing GM12878 and YH datasets. Supplementary
Figure S5b and d show the distribution of allelic ratios of SNPs
called by GATK in each dataset. RASER again shows the most un—
biased results, which are similar to the distributions in
Supplementary Figure S5a and c that used the SNP calling filters we
implemented.

In addition, we evaluated the performance of the aligners in SNP
calling resulted from GATK. We counted true—positive and false—
positive SNPs and calculated FDR on SNP detection. True positives
were defined as correctly detected SNPs by GATK when compared
with known GM12878 or YH SNPs based on their respective gen—
ome sequencing data. False positives were defined as GATK—called
SNPs that satisfied all three requirements: (i) the predicted SNP was
not known GM12878 or YH SNPs; (ii) the predicted SNP was not
listed as known human editing sites in the RADAR database
(Ramaswami and Li, 2014) and (iii) the SNP was covered with more
than 20 reads in total. Although these ‘false positives’ could indeed
be true SNPs missed by genome sequencing or true RNA editing sites
not in RADAR, we can reasonably assume that they proportionally
represent the amount of wrong SNPs identified by each aligner.

For the YH data, RASER yielded the smallest FDR
(Supplementary Fig. S5f). For GM12878, RASER demonstrated
smaller FDR than GSNAP and STAR and slightly larger FDR than
TOPHAT2 (Supplementary Fig S5e). These results can be explained
by the fact that TOPHAT2 showed generally good performance for

Fig. 5. Identification of RNA editing sites in K562 data. The ‘obviously best'
scheme was used for RASER and unique mapping was reported from the
other aligners. Editing sites that were only identified by RASER (‘RASER
only') or by the other aligner were analyzed. Percentage of A to G editing sites
(blue) and FDR values (red) are shown. FDR is defined as the percentage of
originally predicted editing sites that were removed by the artifact filters.
These filters remove RNA—DNA differences sites that satisfy one of the fol-
lowing: (i) covered by reads with a strand bias, (ii) with 100% editing, (iii) with
low-editing levels (<10% or <3 edited reads), (iv) close to splice sites
(i.e. 34 nt from spliced junctions), (v) within simple repeats (defined by
Repeatmasker), (vi) within homopolymer repeats (Repeatmasker) and (vii)
overlapping known SNPs in public databases (dbSNP) (see Lee et al., 2013 for
details)

short (50 bp) reads and GM12878 reads (76 bp) are shorter than
YH reads (100 bp). It should be noted that, although RASER has
slightly lower recall rate in read mapping (Fig. 3b), its sensitivity in
SNP calling is not lower than other aligners. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S5e and f, the number of true—positive SNPs
identified by RASER is often larger than those by other aligners.

3.4 Identification of RNA editing sites

Another application of single—nucleotide analysis of RNA—Seq data
is to identify RNA editing sites, which is gaining broad attention
in recent years (Lee et al., 2013). In previous studies, since read
mapping is not perfect, a series of post—mapping filters were de—
signed to remove likely false—positive editing sites resulted from
possible mapping artifacts (Lee et al., 2013). We thus applied these
artifact filters to the results of each aligner (see Supplementary
Fig. S6 legend). RASER yielded the highest % AG values in all
three datasets with or without these artifact filters (Supplementary
Fig. S6).

The %AG value represents percentage of A—to—G mismatches
among all predicted RNA—DNA differences. It is generally accepted
that higher the %AG, the better the accuracy of predicted editing
sites (Peng et al., 2012; Ramaswami et al., 2013). This is based on a
prevailing assumption in the field that A—to—I editing (leading to
A—to—G mismatches) should account for most of the observed editing
sites.

Another metric to evaluate performance of aligners is to calcu—
late an FDR defined as the percentage of originally identified editing
sites that were removed by the artifact filters (Lee et al., 2013). By
definition, these filters remove artifacts in the mapping results.
Thus, the more sites that were removed by the filters, the more arti—
facts there were in the original results.

To focus on the differences of the aligners, we segregated the pre—
dicted editing sites into those that were only identified by RASER,
only by the other aligner in comparison or by both RASER and the
counterpart aligner. We calculated the %AG (post—filtering) and
FDR for each subset of editing sites (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig.
S7). The results showed that RASER out—performs the other aligners
in terms of both %AG and FDR for all three datasets included in
this study.

It should be noted that editing sites common to RASER and an—
other aligner generally had lower FDR than sites that were specific

to one aligner (Supplementary Fig. S7c and d), except in the YH
data where RASER—specific sites had the lowest FDR (Fig. S7e). This
observation is consistent with the expectation that results common
to multiple aligners should be highly accurate, which in one way
confirms the validity of our method to evaluate accuracy (i.e. by
FDR). It should also be noted that RASER normally identifies less
editing sites than the other aligners (Supplementary Fig. S7c—e).
However, because those sites that were unique to the other aligners
had high FDR, RASER’s performance in accuracy outweighs its
somewhat lower sensitivity because improved accuracy is highly de—
sirable in editing analysis.

3.5 Evaluation of running time and memory

We compared running time of different aligners for 12 simulated
datasets on a machine with Intel (R) Xeon (R) CPU E5—2680 v2 at
2.80 GHz X 40, and 256 GB of memory (Table 1). In general, run—
ning time of RASER is similar to that of TOPHAT2 (slightly faster
than TOPHAT2 if the read length 3 100 bases and somewhat slower
otherwise). RASER with the OB mapping scheme is slower than
RASER without any mapping scheme or with the DF scheme. This
is because OB mapping requires a search for all the possible candi—
date mappings with a large mismatch ratio (mr + ob). As expected,
STAR shows extraordinarily short running time. GSNAP is rela—
tively slow for short read length (50 nt), but the running time is im—
proved for longer read length (100—200 nt). For memory, RASER
required less than 5 0% of memory than GSNAP or STAR.
TOPHAT2 is the most memory efficient but with increased memory
requirement for longer reads. Supplementary Figure S8 shows a vi—
gnette—like example ﬂow of RASER.

RASER: reads aligner for SNPs and editing sites of RNA

4 Discussion

Accurate and unbiased identification and quantification of SNPs or
RNA editing sites using RNA—Seq data proved to be challenging
tasks (Degner et al., 2009; Heap et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013;
Pastinen, 2010). These challenges call for an in—depth analysis of the
performance of short read aligners in handling SNVs and develop—
ment of new aligners tailored for this purpose. Because of existence
of sequence similarity across different regions of a genome, false—
positive mappings may occur where reads originated from one
region align to another region by mistake with a small number of
mismatches. These mismatches are then exploited in subsequent
analysis for studies of SNPs or RNA editing. Mapping errors may
only affect a relatively small number of reads. However, since the
total number of reads harboring true SNVs is expected to be small
relative to all reads of a dataset, those incorrectly mapped reads
often constitute a considerable portion of reads used to analyze for
SNPs or RNA editing sites. Therefore, these applications call for
very accurate read mapping.

To tackle this problem, we reason that if an aligner can find all
or almost all mapping positions of a read, these results can then be
examined strategically to exclude ambiguous mappings and
reduce false—positive rate. RASER was designed according to this
rationale. In contrast, existing aligners do not generally report all
or almost all mapping positions of a read, thus impractical to be
combined with the OB or DF schemes integrated into RASER. We
showed that RASER can effectively identify repeat—generated
reads as multiply mapped reads and its mapping precision is higher
than other popular aligners. Although RASER outperforms
other aligners in overall mapping precision by a small margin, this
seemingly small improvement enabled considerably better results
in the analyses of SNPs and RNA editing sites. This observation is
again due to the sensitivity of such analyses to incorrectly mapped
reads that contain apparent mismatches relative to the reference.
In addition, RASER also demonstrates superior performance in
identifying spliced junctions, a critical aspect of RNA—Seq read
mapping.

Many aligners have been developed to map short reads generated
by high—throughput sequencing experiments. It is important to note
that different applications call for different aligners with specific
properties. RASER is appropriate for applications where accurate
mapping is highly desirable, especially if SNVs in the short reads are
sought after. The improved mapping precision of RASER is largely
resulted from its novel tree structure that reduces ambiguity in map—
ping of repetitive sequences and relatively complete search of all
possible mappings. Despite its extensive search for alternative map—
ping positions, RASER shows comparable mapping speed to
TOPHAT2 or GSNAP. Furthermore, RASER requires less memory
than GSNAP and STAR, which is a desirable feature for aligners in
parallel computing environments where memory usage is often an
important issue.

Note that RASER benefits from removing ambiguously mapped
reads for applications involving SNPs or RNA editing prediction.
Removal of ambiguous reads may not be advisable for other appli—
cations, such as transcript reconstruction where ambiguous reads
can be utilized (Pertea et al., 2015; Zickmann et al., 2014).

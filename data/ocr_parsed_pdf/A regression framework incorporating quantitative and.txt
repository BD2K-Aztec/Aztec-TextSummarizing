ABSTRACT

Motivation: Predicting protein interactions involving peptide
recognition domains is essential for understanding the many
important biological processes they mediate. It is important
to consider the binding strength of these interactions to help us
construct more biologically relevant protein interaction networks that
consider cellular context and competition between potential binders.
Results: We developed a novel regression framework that considers
both positive (quantitative) and negative (qualitative) interaction
data available for mouse PDZ domains to quantitatively predict
interactions between PDZ domains, a large peptide recognition
domain family, and their peptide ligands using primary sequence
information. First, we show that it is possible to learn from existing
quantitative and negative interaction data to infer the relative
binding strength of interactions involving previously unseen PDZ
domains and/or peptides given their primary sequence. Performance
was measured using cross-validated hold out testing and testing
with previously unseen PDZ domain—peptide interactions. Second,
we find that incorporating negative data improves quantitative
interaction prediction. Third, we show that sequence similarity is an
important prediction performance determinant, which suggests that
experimentally collecting additional quantitative interaction data for
underrepresented PDZ domain subfamilies will improve prediction.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modular domains are the major building blocks of eukaryotic
proteins and interaction networks (Pawson and Nash, 2003). These
domains usually fold independently and are present in various
combinations within a single protein to create a rich repertoire
of functionally diverse proteins from a more limited domain set
(Vogel et (11., 2004). An important subclass of these domains,
peptide recognition modules (PRMs), bind to short extended and
linear peptide segments in target proteins to mediate protein—protein
interactions in eukaryotic cell signaling systems (Pawson and Nash,
2003). Characterizing the interactions of these peptide recognition
modules will help us map and understand the many biological
processes they mediate.

PRMs generally bind their peptide ligands in the weak (10 MM)
afﬁnity (binding strength) range (Castagnoli et (11., 2004), and
sensitive in vitro experimental techniques like phage display
(Tonikian et (11., 2008, 2009) and peptide/protein microarrays (Jones
et (11., 2006; Stifﬂer et (11., 2006) have been used to map the
binding speciﬁcities and protein interactions of large sets of SH3
(Landgraf et (11., 2004; Tonikian et (11., 2009), SH2 (Huang et (11.,
2008; Jones et (11., 2006), W (Hu et (11., 2004) and PDZ (Stifﬂer
et (11., 2006, 2007; Tonikian et (11., 2008) domains. However,
these experimental techniques are resource intensive, and cannot
be readily applied to new members and alleles of PRMs that
are increasingly being collected by genome sequencing projects
and population-based genetic variation studies (The International
HapMap Consortium, 2007). Ideally, a computational model could
be developed to predict whether a PRM will bind to a peptide
given their primary sequences. Such a model could be used to
predict protein interactions from newly sequenced genomes and the
effect of mutations on known PRM-mediated protein interactions
to guide subsequent experimental characterization. Computational
domain—peptide interaction prediction has been studied for multiple
PRMs, such as SH3 (Ferraro et (11., 2006; Yaffe et (11., 2001), SH2
(Sanchez et (11., 2008; Wunderlich and Mirny, 2009), PDZ (Chen
et (11., 2008), W (Schleinkofer et (11., 2004) and MHC domains
(Jacob and Vert, 2008; Nielsen et (11., 2008; Zhang et (11., 2009)
(which are a special case of peptide binding domains that do not
mediate protein—protein interactions). These approaches, except for

some MHC studies and the pioneering work of Chen et (11. (2008),
predict binding qualitatively—Le. whether or not a domain—peptide
pair will bind.

To gain a better understanding of in viva protein interaction
networks, we also need to know the strength of domain—peptide
binding, not just whether they bind or not. This information can help
us understand the competition among multiple potential interactors
for the same protein in the cell. Binding strength is also an important
factor in the ﬁne-tuning of many regulatory processes, such as
the afﬁnity-driven sequential phosphorylation of residues on the
FGF receptor (Lew et (11., 2009), the afﬁnity-driven sequential
activation of genes targeted by a common transcription factor
(Chechik et (11., 2008) and the ﬁne-tuning of the HOG pathway in
response to osmolarity stress (Zarrinpar et (11., 2003). Whereas large
sets of quantitative data have permitted quantitative prediction of
MHC—peptide interactions for MHC domains through data-driven
machine learning approaches (Nielsen et (11., 2008; Zhang et (11.,
2009), sufﬁcient quantitative interaction data has only recently
become available to enable similar computational approaches for
modular interaction domains involved in cellular signaling (Stifﬂer
et (11., 2007).

The ﬁrst PRM with large-scale afﬁnity data available is the
PDZ domain (Stifﬂer et (11., 2007). PDZ-containing proteins are
important in ion channel and receptor regulation, cell polarity, neural
development, and often act as scaffolds to organize the assembly of
protein complexes in cell signaling pathways in normal and disease
situations (Cushing et (11., 2008; Nourry et (11., 2003). Here, we
develop a computational method, trained on the set of interaction
data measured in Stifﬂer et (11. (2007) to quantitatively predict
PDZ domain—peptide interactions involving previously unseen PDZ
domains and/or peptides from their primary sequences.

Interaction data generated in Stifﬂer et (11. (2007) consists
of a positive dataset of PDZ domain—peptide interactions with
binding afﬁnity measurements and a negative dataset (non-
interacting PDZ domain—peptide pairs, with no binding afﬁnity
measurements). Intuitively, the negative interaction data provide
qualitative information on the contribution of amino acids to binding
afﬁnity that could improve quantitative prediction. Popularly used
position weight matrix (PWM) and conventional regression methods
like support vector regression (SVR), however, cannot incorporate
qualitative negative data. Here, we devised a novel extension of
SVR, termed SemiSVR, that considers both quantitative positive
and qualitative negative interaction data. We show that SemiSVR,
being able to incorporate negative data, is better than SVR and
PWM in identifying the stronger interactor among previously unseen
peptides. Next, through a feature-encoding framework that considers
both the primary sequence of PDZ domains and peptides, we applied
SemiSVR to predict relative binding strength of PDZ domain—
peptide interactions involving previously unseen PDZ domains.
We ﬁnd that SemiSVR’s performance is superior to a previously
published method on the same dataset (Chen et (11., 2008) and the
naive usage of PWM from sequence-similar PDZ domains.

and negative PDZ domainipeptide pairs were previously determined
by a combination of protein microarray and ﬂuorescence polarization
experiments. PDZ domain and peptide features calculated from primary
sequence information were used to construct a quantitative binding predictor
using our novel semi-quantitative support vector regression (SemiSVR)
method, where negative data are used to help regression learning. (B)
Conceptual illustration of how SemiSVR works. Sample data for illustration
purposes were generated using the function: y=x (black solid line) with
normally distributed noise. Quantitative data (positive) are shown as open
black circles while the qualitative data (negative) are shown as ﬁlled red
circles. The SemiSVR method (red dashed dot line), which considers the
quantitative data and qualitative data, better learns the function (yzx)
used to generate the input data compared with the SVR method (blue
dashed line), which only considers the quantitative data (open circles). In
this way, incorporating qualitative negative data using SemiSVR improves
quantitative prediction.

et a1. (2007), containing interactions between 82 mouse PDZ domains and
217 mouse genome-derived (genomic) peptides. Brieﬂy, interactions were
assessed using a peptide microarray followed by conﬁrmation of positives
and measurement of binding afﬁnities by ﬂuorescence polarization (FP), a
high-quality afﬁnity measurement method (Stifﬂer 61611., 2007). This resulted
in 560 PDZ domainipeptide interactions, involving 82 mouse PDZ domains
and 93 peptides, and 1167 negative interactions, involving 82 mouse PDZ
domains and 138 peptides, which were conﬁrmed by FP. The 560 positive
interactions have measured afﬁnities (each measured as a dissociation
constant, Kd) of less than 100 MM (high Kd indicates weak interaction
and low Kd indicates strong interaction, see Supplementary Fig. S1 for
distribution of the KDs) while the afﬁnities of the non-binding pairs are
identiﬁed to be greater than the threshold (100 MM), but Kd values are not
measured. We call the mixture of both quantitative (positive interactions) and
qualitative (negative interactions) ‘semi-quantitative’ data. The number of
binding peptides per PDZ domain varies widely. Among the 82 domains, 23
have at least 10 binding peptides, which we use for training (Supplementary
Table S1).

2.2 Predictor

We wish to predict quantitative PDZ domainipeptide interactions based on
known interactions and afﬁnity data. To do this, we developed a new method
called Semi-quantitative SVR (SemiSVR), a novel extension of SVR, to
learn how to predict the binding afﬁnity of PDZ domainipeptide interactions
from both quantitative binding (positive) data and qualitative non-binding
(negative) data (Fig. 1). SVR is an established machine learning method
for non-linear regression (Smola and Scholkopf, 2004). We extended this
method to take advantage of negative information we have available, which is
not considered by other regression-based methods. In non-linear regression,
the regression function (f) is approximated by a kernel function K (x, y) as

where X) is the known training data, and 01 = (011 , 012, ... ,Olm)T (T =transpose,

the positive and negative PDZ domainipeptide pairs, respectively, yi is the
afﬁnity for positive quantitative data X), and the regression value for the
training data zj is greater than a threshold (i.e. y: 100 MM).

For the positive quantitative data X), we wish to minimize the 8-insensitive
loss function-based error criterion that leads to U”(x,»)—y,»| 58, that is the
regression values f(x,») on the training data X) should have less error
than 8, 1: 1,2,  ,m. For the negative qualitative data zj, we wish to
make the regression value f(zj) on these data satisfy the prior knowledge
[i.e. the regression value f(zj) is greater than the threshold 9:10011M]:
rep—9,158 andrj 211:1; 

The above constraints assume that the ﬁnal regression function f(x) can
approximate all the data (S) with 8 precision. Sometimes, however, we want
to allow for some errors. As with standard SVR, a slack variable E and E can
be introduced to cope with otherwise unsatisﬁable constraints. Considering
all of this and similar to previous work on knowledge-based non-linear kernel
approximation (Mangasarian and Wild, 2007), the linear programming form
of Semi-quantitative SVR is given as:

where 8 is a user-deﬁned constant that contributes to the 8-insensitive loss
function, which measures the error of the regression on the training data, and
is deﬁned as |§|S :0, if |§| <8, and equal to |§| —8, otherwise. C1, C2 > O are
the penalty parameters determining the trade-off between the regularization
term (in order to avoid overﬁtting) and the empirical error (according to
8-insensitive loss function). Here, we drive the error down by minimizing
the 1-norm of the errors and together with the 1-norm of oz for complexity
reduction or stabilization. Previous work shows the alternative 1-norm for
2-norm regularization achieves equivalent performance (see Mangasarian
at 611., 2004; 2007). Constraints (34) ensure that the positive pairs lie in
8-precision with some allowed errors while constraints (577) ensure the
negative pairs satisfy the prior knowledge within some allowed errors. In
practice, all afﬁnities are scaled to the range [—1, 1] after taking log10,
which makes the data easier to work with. We select parameters C1, C2, 8
and the kernel parameters (a or [7) using grid search (Chang and Lin, 2001).

The input of the semi-quantitative SVR model is the encoded
representation of the PDZ domainipeptide pair (see below) and the
corresponding binding afﬁnity while the output is the predicted afﬁnity
score for each pair. (Higher scores mean weaker interaction while lower
scores mean stronger interaction, similar to the scale of biochemical KDs).

All software was developed in Matlab 2008 and source code is available on
the web site (http://baderlab.org/Data/PDZAfﬁnity).

As a benchmark, we also developed a nearest neighbor SemiSVR for each
test PDZ domain that was trained on the closest PDZ domain with both its
binding and non-binding peptides. We only trained a predictor if the closest
PDZ domain has 3 10 binding peptides (changing this threshold to nearby
values does not affect our conclusions).

Generally, there are two strategies to build predictive models for peptide
recognition domain-mediated interactions. A single-domain model is trained
only on the interactions of an individual PDZ domain (one domain and its
binding peptides) while a multi-domain model uses interaction data from
multiple PDZ domains.

We tested our models using leave-one-PDZ-domain-out cross-validation,
as domain sequence is important for performance. For the single-domain
model, we trained on one single PDZ domain associated with all the
interaction data, and tested for the held-out PDZ domain. For the multi-
domain model, at each run, we trained the SemiSVR model on interaction
data involving all PDZ domains but one, and then predicted the relative
binding strength of all peptides interacting with the held-out PDZ domain.

2.3 Feature encoding

We represented a PDZ domain-peptide as a vector of descriptors including
sparse vectors of either the full domain (1 18AA) or different deﬁnitions of the
domain binding site (16 or 10AA) and the peptide ligand (10AA) and links
between domain and peptide positions. Speciﬁcally, a PDZ domain=(P1,
P2, . . . P”) and a peptide = (pep 1 , pepz, . . . , pepk), where Pi and pepj represent
amino acids at a given position (i-th on the PDZ domain or j—th on the
peptide)iin our case, n: 118 and k: 10. A PDZ domainipeptide pair is
encoded as a tensor (outer) product between descriptor PDZ and peptide:
PDZ*peptide=(P1pep1, Plpepz,  , P1 pepk, Pzpepl,  , Pnpepk). Since the
inner product between two tensor product vectors (each one encoding one
domainipeptide pair) can be rewritten as a product of two inner products
(Jacob and Vert, 2008), we compute the inner product between vectors of
any two PDZ domains or vectors of any two peptides. Furthermore, kernels
on sequences can replace the inner product between the vectors of any two
domains or any two peptides (the kernel trick), such as K(PDZl*peptide1,
PDZz*peptide2)=K(PDZI , PDZz) >< K(peptide1, peptidez). Thus, when
sequences are used as the input for the kernels, one can rewrite the polynomial
kernel as follows: Kp01y(x, y) = (Kbasennebr, y)+ 1)” , where Kbaselme is simply
the number of letters the input sequences (domain sequences or peptide
sequences, respectively) have in common at the same positions. In practice,
all kernels were normalized to 1 on the diagonal by Knormalize(x, y):
Kp01y(x,y)/, /Kp01y(x,x) >< Kp01y(y, y) to make computation easier.

To encode the PDZ domain, we used the same alignment as published
by Chen et a1. (2008) since we want to compare our method to Chen’s
method using the same encoding (e.g. the same 16 binding sites). This
alignment represents the conserved part of the domain containing all
conserved secondary structure elements and the canonical binding site.
See Supplementary Material for details and Supplementary Fig. S2 for the
pairwise identity distribution of all pairs of 82 PDZ domain sequences based
on this alignment. For the peptide, we use the entire length of 10 amino acids
in all experiments.

There are many different feature encodings and kernels that could be
used for our prediction task. We tried encoding PDZ domains using Profeat
features (Li at 611., 2006), which includes amino acid physicochemical
properties, sequence pattern frequency and correlations; conventional sparse
encoding where each position is represented as a vector of length 20 (one
element for every amino acid type) has a one in the element corresponding
to the amino acid at that position and the rest of the 19 elements are set
to zeros, and then all vectors are concatenated; encoding peptides using 5
factors Atchley et a1. (2005) and 11 factors (Liu at 611., 2006), which are also
based on amino acid physicochemical properties. We encoded the peptide
using all above encodings, except for Profeat, for which the peptide sequence
is too short. However, none of these encodings (Gaussian kernel) resulted in

better performance than using the above described sequence-based encoding
with a polynomial kernel (Supplementary Table S2).

3 RESULTS

Our goal is to predict binding strength of a previously unseen
PDZ domain—peptide pair based on the primary sequence of the
domain and peptide and quantitative interaction data. To address
this, we applied regression analysis to published PDZ domain—
peptide binding afﬁnity data obtained using a combination of protein
microarray and ﬂuorescence polarization experiments (Chen et (11.,
2008; Stifﬂer et (11., 2007).

3.1 Incorporating negative data for quantitative
interaction prediction

3.1.] Single domain models Often, peptides that bind a PDZ
domain will be modeled using a PWM, one per domain. The PWM
method has been shown to capture binding energy (Stormo, 2000)
and is often used for predicting PRM domain—peptide interactions
(Tong et (11., 2002; Tonikian et (11., 2008). As a basic test of the
modeling capability of the SemiSVR method and to compare it to
the established PWM method (see Supplementary Materials), which
was trained on quantitative data only, we trained it using positive
quantitative and negative peptide data of an individual PDZ domain.
We then tested the ability of each method to distinguish the stronger
binding peptide among a pair of peptides randomly held out from
the training peptide set (run for all possible peptide pairs, either two
binders or a binder and a non-binder) and generated a percentage
success rate for each of the 23 PDZ domains that bound at least
10 peptides. We found that the SemiSVR method performs better
than the PWM method at the same task for the vast majority of
PDZ domains (21/23, average performance of 0.79 versus 0.72, P-
value=0.0023, ranksum testing, Table 1). We had similar results
when comparing to SVR (Table 1). Hence, incorporating negative
data in regression analysis through SemiSVR improves quantitative
prediction of interacting peptides, and even a simple application of
the SemiSVR method given a set of peptides per domain is useful.

3.1.2 Multi-domain model We next trained the SemiSVR on
interaction data of multiple PDZ domains to predict quantitative
domain—peptide interactions involving previously unseen PDZ
domains. We tested this using leave-one-PDZ-domain-out cross-
validation, where we trained the SemiSVR model on interaction
data involving all PDZ domains but one, and then predicted the
relative binding strength of all peptides interacting with the held-
out PDZ domain. To measure performance, we correlated the
SemiSVR score with actual binding afﬁnities using Pearson and
Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcients. Since too few data points lead
to inconclusive correlation results, we assessed the performance only
for the 23 PDZ domains that bound to 10 or more peptides.

To enable the SemiSVR to learn from interaction data of multiple
PDZ domains, the primary sequence of each PDZ domain and
peptide in our training set was encoded as a feature vector (as
compared with single domain testing where only peptides were
encoded). We evaluated various ways of encoding these features
(see Section 2 and Supplementary Table S2). For every PDZ
domain—peptide interaction, we combined the feature vectors with
the interaction binding afﬁnity for regression analysis. We used a
pairwise encoding with a polynomial kernel, which captures all

this predictor performed best in initial experiments (see Section 2

deﬁned with 118 positions according to the PDZ domain multiple
sequence alignment (Chen et (11., 2008) and peptides were all of

For comparison, we trained an SVR model exactly as for the
SemiSVR model, but only on quantitative positive data, while
the SemiSVR was trained on both quantitative positive data and
qualitative negative data. The SemiSVR performed better than SVR
(Table 2), thus negative information is useful for regression and we
used the multi-domain SemiSVR for further experiments. Closer
inspection of the output score of SemiSVR and SVR indicates that
both methods can predict relative, but not absolute, binding afﬁnities
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

Performance comparison based on leave-one-PDZ-domain out cross-validation.
Performance, measured by Spearman’s and Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for each
domain are shown. The performance of SemiSVR with whole PDZ sequence (118AAs)
and SemiSVR with 38 contacting residue position pairs and Chen’s Backﬂtting method
are listed in columns two to four. For the SemiSVR using 38 contacting residue position
pairs as feature input, the linear kernel was used. The Chen method was run using the
published implementation. All methods used all 10AA positions of the peptide. Bold
numbers indicate the best performance for a given domain.

3.1.3 Comparison with (1 published method We next tested if
our new SemiSVR method performs better than the only published
method for quantitative prediction of PDZ domain interactions
applied to the same PDZ afﬁnity dataset (Chen et (11., 2008). This
method uses input features that represent pairs of domain—peptide
amino acids that spatially contact based on a PDZ domain—peptide
structure. The contribution of each of the resulting 38 pairs to the
interaction was learned from the afﬁnity data (Chen et (11., 2008). The
published method was developed for both binary and quantitative
prediction, but here we only compared SemiSVR to the quantitative
version. We used leave-one-PDZ-domain-out cross-validation and
Spearman’s and Pearson correlation to measure performance of each
method on the 23 PDZ domains that bound 10 or more peptides. The
SemiSVR method performed better for the vast majority (20 of 23)
of PDZ domains (Table 3). As a second test, we trained the SemiSVR
model using the same ‘38 pairs’ input feature encoding developed
by Chen. Again, the SemiSVR performed better in the majority of
cases (18 of 23 PDZ domains; Table 3)—see Section 3.2 for an
investigation into the domains that were poorly predicted. Thus,

Identity to Its nearest framing set domain

Fig. 2. Sequence similarity of a test PDZ domain to a training domain is
an important performance determinant. PDZ domain similarity is deﬁned by
percent sequence identity and is calculated between each test PDZ domain to
its nearest neighbor in the training set composed of 81 other PDZ domains.
The prediction performance of the corresponding SemiSVR model is shown
as Spearman’s correlation.

our SemiSVR is superior in method and input feature encoding
compared with a previously published method.

3.2 Performance determinants of quantitative
prediction

To explore which aspects of our input features are most important
for prediction performance, we trained a multi-domain SemiSVR
model using subsets of PDZ domain sequences. We used 16
binding positions from the al-syntrophin PDZ (a1 synPDZ) structure
described in Chen et (11. (2008), and also 10 core binding positions
derived from the intersection of all binding sites in nine available
PDZ domain—peptide structures described in Tonikian et (11. (2008).
Using the whole PDZ sequence gave better overall performance,
although the binding site encoding gives comparable performance
(Supplementary Table S3), achieving Spearman’s correlation of
0.605, 0.594, 0.594 and Pearson correlation of 0.653, 0.636, 0.649
for whole PDZ sequence, 16 binding positions and 10 core binding
positions, respectively. This suggests that additional information is
present in non-binding site positions that improves performance.
Next, we assessed the relationship between the predictor
performance and percent sequence identity of the test PDZ to its
nearest domain in the training set. We observed a positive correlation
between performance and sequence identity (Fig. 2, Spearman’s
correlation, 0.498; P =0.0157). To further study this trend, we
progressively removed all training PDZ domain interactions that
are above a sequence similarity threshold to the test PDZ domain
and retrained a SemiSVR model for each test domain (whole
PDZ, pairwise polynomial kernel). We observed that the average
SemiSVR performance decreased as the level of similarity of the test
PDZ domain to the closest PDZ domain in the training set decreased
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Hence, sequence similarity between a test

PDZ domain and PDZ domains in the training set is a determinant
of predictor performance.

3.3 A global approach improves the prediction
performance

One potential advantage of our encoding framework approach
is that we can incorporate interaction data of multiple PDZ
domains (global) rather than just close neighbors (local) to improve
prediction. To investigate this, we trained a set of ‘nearest neighbor’
SemiSVR predictors using only interaction data of the single
domain with the highest sequence similarity to each test PDZ
domain, ensuring that enough interaction data are used to create
a viable predictor, and compared their performance to our multi-
domain SemiSVR. In addition, since the SemiSVR’s performance
is correlated with the sequence similarity of a test PDZ domain to
those in training data, we also assessed how the naive usage of
PWM based on the peptides of the nearest PDZ neighbor performs
for quantitative interaction prediction.

We tested different ways to identify the nearest neighbor using
whole PDZ, 16 and 10 position binding sites, and based on
amino acid identity and scoring matrix BLOSUM62. Nearest
neighbor SemiSVR performed better than the naive PWM transfer
method, presumably because negative interactions help with
prediction. However, our multi-domain SemiSVR gave the best
performance overall (Table 4). Thus, while sequence similarity
is an important factor and nearest neighbors are important
contributors to performance, our multi-domain SemiSVR uses
additional information from across the PDZ domain family to
improve performance.

3.4 Validation of the method using blind PDZ
domain—peptide afﬁnity measurements

We next tested the SemiSVR model on newly measured PDZ
domain—peptide interactions that were not used for training. The
third PDZ domain of the human Scribble protein PDZ was
cloned, expressed and puriﬁed and binding afﬁnities to 57 peptides
from natural human proteins were measured using ﬂuorescence
polarization (see Supplementary Material and Supplementary
Table S4). Only the third PDZ domain was used because the other
three had less than 45% sequence identity to the training set. This

Fig. 3. SemiSVR can predict changes in afﬁnity resulting from point
mutations introduced into known binding peptides of the al syn PDZ domain.
The three wild-type peptides are denoted by asterisks (*). Each mutant within
a set is labeled by a different shape. Residue mutations are highlighted in red.
One KIFlB mutant had no measurable binding, so it was excluded from our
analysis. Performance of the SemiSVR on peptide mutation of alsynPDZ is
very high (Spearman’s correlation, 0.921, P < 1e-16 and Pearson correlation,
0.922, P = 1.414e-07). All afﬁnities are scaled to the range [— 1, 1] after taking
log 10.

resulted in 36 binding peptides, enough for a conﬁdent performance
assessment. The result shows that our SemiSVR method can
accurately predict PDZ domain—peptide interactions (Spearman’s
correlation, 0.74, P = 8.85e-7). We found similar results testing our
model on interactions involving domains in Fly and Worm data
(Supplementary Table S5).

3.5 Predicting effect of peptide mutations

As another test of our SemiSVR method, we predicted the change in
binding afﬁnity of PDZ domain—peptide interactions resulting from
amino acid changes in the peptide. We used a previously published
dataset of PDZ—peptide afﬁnities measured with ﬂuorescence
polarization (Chen et (11., 2008) in which ﬁve single point mutations
were introduced into each of three wild-type binding peptides (from
proteins: Kv1.5, Nav1.5 and KIFlB) that bind the alsyn PDZ
domain. The SemiSVR model successfully predicted the relative
afﬁnity change (increase or decrease versus wild type) for all mutants
(i.e. 14/14 = 100%, one mutated KIFlB ligand had no measurable
binding afﬁnity). The correlations between the predicted and actual
afﬁnities of the mutated peptides for the SemiSVR are very high
(Spearman’s correlation, 0.921; P <1e-16 and Pearson correlation
0.922; P = 1.414e-07) (Fig. 3). Therefore, our method can correctly
predict the direction and relative magnitude of afﬁnity changes in
the mutant ligand compared with the wild type.

3.6 Binary classiﬁcation of PDZ domain—peptide
interactions

Next, we assessed the performance of the multi-domain SemiSVR
method on the presumably easier binary classiﬁcation task—to
predict whether a PDZ domain will bind a peptide or not. We
performed leave-one-PDZ-domain-out cross-validation on the 23
PDZ domains with sufﬁcient (>10) positive and negative peptides
for the SemiSVR model and computed the average area under the

receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). The SemiSVR
model was trained as before with all 81 non-test PDZ domains. The
average ROC AUC score was 0.88 (Supplementary Fig. SSA).

To compare this result with that of a previous method for binary
prediction published in Chen et (11. (2008), we used their bootstrap
testing approach. (i) PDZ bootstrap: leave 12% out for testing; (ii)
peptide bootstrap: leave 8% out for testing; and (iii) both PDZ and
peptide bootstrap. The SemiSVR performed well in this test (AUC
of 0.862 :I: 0.016, 0.853 :I: 0.021 and 0.848 :I: 0.017, respectively,
Supplementary Fig. S5B), which is comparable to the published
performance of Chen’s model [AUC: 0.91 (conﬁdence interval (CI)
0.84—0.96), 0.84 (95% CI 0.76—0.89) and 0.87 (CI 0.67—0.98),
respectively].

4 DISCUSSION

Inferring the relative strength of protein—peptide interactions
mediated by peptide recognition modules (PRMs) will lead to better
understanding of cellular processes. Here, we show that it is possible
to predict afﬁnity of PDZ domain—peptide interactions based on
primary sequence information. We also show that incorporating
both positive and negative interaction data using a novel SemiSVR
approach improves prediction. This approach is also successful at
predicting which PDZ domain—peptide pairs are likely to interact
(binary prediction).

Based on the experimental data, a threshold of 100 MM
separates quantitative ‘positive’ data from qualitative ‘negative’
data. Changing this threshold to more stringent values (i.e. 20 and
10 11M) did not change our results (Supplementary Table S6).

Although our method is mainly based on sequence similarity, it is
interesting to analyze how much physicochemical factors contribute
to our prediction performance. To investigate this, we assessed
how well each of 11 properties from the ‘11-factor’ encoding
(Liu et (11., 2006) can be used individually for quantitative prediction
of PDZ—peptide interactions using SemiSVR. We found that
isoelectric point, hydrophilicity scale, polarity, average accessible
surface area, van der Waals parameter epsilon and steric parameter
are most important for performance, in decreasing order, suggesting
they are the physicochemical factors that mostly modulate the
binding strength of PDZ—peptide interactions (Supplementary
Fig. S6).

Given that physical forces between the domain and the peptide
3D structures determine afﬁnity, and our observation that SemiSVR
performance correlates with sequence similarity between PDZ
domains in testing and training sets, we postulate that natural
PDZ domains with similar sequences have similar 3D structures
that determine afﬁnity in similar ways. This is supported by the
observation that PDZ speciﬁcities are found conserved from worm
to human (Tonikian et (11., 2008). It has been shown that it is easy
to mutate PDZ domains to bind non-natural ligands; however, we
only see a limited set of PDZ domain speciﬁcities in nature (Ernst
et (11., 2009; Tonikian et (11., 2008). These observations are consistent
with a constrained model of PDZ speciﬁcity evolution where a set
of initial PDZ domain speciﬁcities evolved, and that these were then
expanded to form a ﬁnite number of subfamilies, each functionally
similar down to the level of afﬁnity determination. This model
predicts that each subfamily has a characteristic structure and mode
of determining binding afﬁnity with a ligand. Regardless, we ﬁnd
that information useful for prediction is taken from the entire PDZ

domain family and this improves prediction performance compared
with using a naive nearest neighbor-based predictor. As our method
is trained on interaction data of natural PDZ domains, it may not do
well at quantitative interaction prediction involving synthetic PDZ
domains that have multiple mutations not found in our training data.
We have noticed, in other work, that synthetic mutations may cause
large changes in speciﬁcity, and presumably afﬁnity (Ernst et (11.,
2009; Tonikian et (11., 2008). This may occur by drastically changing
the binding mode, for instance, by causing the peptide to rotate.
We do not notice these types of large speciﬁcity changes arising
from small sequence differences in natural PDZ domains, possibly
because they disrupt normal PDZ function. The reduced predictive
ability on synthetic PDZ domains, at least for speciﬁcity, has also
been recently noticed (Smith and Kortemme, 2010). However, we
were not able to test this due to lack of sufﬁcient afﬁnity data on
synthetic PDZ domains.

We observed that some PDZ domains share identical
subsequences in the 10 and 16 binding positions but bind the
same peptides with different afﬁnity. For example, both Dvll (1/ 1)
and Dvl3 (1/1) share identical subsequences in their 16 binding
positions yet bind to peptide Caspr4 with 79.298 11M and 30.756 11M
Kd, respectively. Assuming the afﬁnities are measured accurately
suggests that additional sequence positions are modulating the
binding strength of PDZ—peptide interactions. This is supported by
previous work showing that sets of non-binding positions coupled
with a binding site contribute to the binding energy (Lockless
and Ranganathan, 1999). It has also been found that mutations in
these sites may affect the structure of the binding site and thus
alter binding afﬁnity (Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999). Although
our best predictor was obtained using the full PDZ sequence, the
performance was only somewhat improved on average compared
with using either 10 or 16 binding positions. This may be due
to the limitation of our sequence-based approach that fails to
capture structural features of PDZ domains and their ligands that
are important for binding. Additional experimental data about how
structural variation in the binding site combined with afﬁnity data
would be useful in the future to further address the importance of
non-binding site positions on afﬁnity.

The binding strength of domain—peptide interactions may also be
affected by the presence of other partners bound. It will be interesting
to examine the potential competition of PDZ binding sites bound by
multiple PDZ domains expressed at different concentrations using
our method. It will also be important to extend our method in the
future to consider co-operativity (Gibson, 2009).

The performance of the SemiSVR depends on sequence similarity
of test PDZ domains to those in the training set with sufﬁcient
binding peptides. The human Scribble PDZ domain we tested is
fairly close to domains in the training set (94% similar), and thus is
a good test of our approach. Because of this, we expect our method
is immediately applicable to PDZ domains in multiple species that
are close to the domains in our training set. We thus used our method
to predict relative afﬁnities for a set of reasonably close mouse and
human PDZ domains (>60% domain sequence identity) to putative
mouse and human PDZ ligands and included it as a convenient
starting set (see Supplementary Tables S7 and S8), which is useful
for prioritizing future experiments.

Our results highlight the need to collect experimental
domain—peptide binding data covering PDZ sequence space to
improve prediction methods. This means we need to measure

afﬁnities for domains that are less sequence related to those with
known peptide afﬁnities. We also need more afﬁnity data from
other species to make a more general conclusion about cross-
species generality. Our future work will include incorporating more
quantitative and qualitative interaction data from multiple sources
into a prediction model to improve performance. For example, it
might be possible to use phage display data to improve coverage and
performance, which only includes qualitative positive PDZ domain—
peptide pairs (Tonikian et (11., 2008). Furthermore, quantitative
prediction can potentially be improved by considering additional
information about the domain and peptide, such as the 3D structure
features of PDZ domains (Hue et (11., 2010; Stein and Aloy, 2010;
Beuming et (11., 2009) and co-evolving residues (Halabi et (11.,
2009) in PDZ domain—peptide pairs. We plan to further develop our
method along these lines and hope to increase its utility and accuracy
in predicting quantitative interactions involving PDZ domains and
apply it to other peptide recognition modules.

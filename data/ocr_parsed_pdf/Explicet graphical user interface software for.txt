ABSTRACT

Summary: Studies of the human microbiome, and microbial commu-
nity ecology in general, have blossomed of late and are now a burgeon-
ing source of exciting research findings. Along with the advent of next-
generation sequencing platforms, which have dramatically increased
the scope of microbiome-related projects, several high-performance
sequence analysis pipelines (e.g. QIIME, MOTHUR, VAMPS) are now
available to investigators for microbiome analysis. The subject of our
manuscript, the graphical user interface-based Explicet software pack-
age, fills a previously unmet need for a robust, yet intuitive means of
integrating the outputs of the software pipelines with user-speciﬁed
metadata and then visualizing the combined data.

Availability and Implementation: Explicet is implemented in C++ via
the Qt framework and supported in native code on all major operating
systems (Windows, Macintosh, Linux). The source code, documents
and tutorials are freely available under an open-source license at
www.explicet.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

The scope of microbial ecology studies has increased signiﬁcantly
over the past decade, driven in part by the realization that
microbial communities are critical mediators of human and eco-
system health. Furthermore, a 10 000-f01d decrease in the cost
of DNA sequencing (www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts) has
resulted in a commensurate increase in the volume of data to
analyze. In response, many software systems (e. g. 168 pipelines)
have been created to deal with the resulting glut of data (Frank
2008, 2009; Frank and Robertson, 2011; Giongo et al., 2010;
Hartman et al., 2010; Kuczynski et al., 2012; Schloss et al.,
2009; vamps.mbl.edu). At present, software tools for microbiome
analysis often require some sophistication in computer skills to
perform even basic analyses. Because tools using graphical user
interfaces provide more facile interactivity for data exploration,

we have developed Explicet (Latin for ‘explanation’), which
consumes the output from existing sequence analysis pipelines
and greatly expedites metadata-driven management, analysis
and Visualization of sequence classiﬁcation results.

2 OVERVIEW OF EXPLICET

Explicet is a scalable (laptop to server) open-source software
package implemented in C++ using the Qt cross platform
application framework (qt-project.org) and the plotting methods
from th (qwt.sourceforge.net). As such, the software is pro-
vided as native code on multiple operating systems (Windows,
Macintosh, Linux). Performance of the primary display window
and file size are 0 [number of samples X number of operational
taxonomic units (OTUs)], yielding good performance with
modest compute capability.

Explicet is compatible with any upstream sequence analysis
pipeline that produces OTU table data, which Explicet displays
in a spreadsheet-like window (Fig. 1A). Metadata, for instance
environmental or clinical attributes, are imported through tab-
delimited or comma separated value formatted ﬂat ﬁles. OTU
data and metadata are managed within a single file as an Explicet
Project. Projects may contain one or more user-defined
Workspaces, which allow bioinformatic experiments to be per-
formed on metadata-derived subsets of Project samples or OTUs
(or both), (e. g. samples from males aged >40 years and only the
OTUs belonging to the phylum Firmicutes). Workspaces store
user-generated Figures displaying descriptive data or Explicet
computations. Workspaces and Figures are persistent and avail-
able for user reference or revision during the analysis life cycle
(Fig. 1B).

Explicet provides several tools for metadata-driven analysis of
microbiome datasets. Basic distributions of OTUs in samples or
categories of samples (deﬁned by user-supplied metadata) can be
displayed Via stacked bar plots, pie charts or heatmaps. OTUs
that differ in abundance and/ or prevalence between user-deﬁned
groups of samples can be identiﬁed by Wilcoxon, two-proportion
and two-part statistical tests (Wagner et al., 2011) and graphic-
ally portrayed as Manhattan plots (Fig. 1C). Ecological alpha
and beta diversity indices (Schloss and Handelsman, 2007) can

3 CONCLUSIONS

Explicet ﬁlls a critical need for a robust, yet intuitive means of
integrating the outputs of sequence processing and classiﬁcation
pipelines with user-speciﬁed metadata and then Visualizing the
combined data. Although designed initially for 16S analysis,
Explicet can be applied to any dataset organized through a hier-
archical classiﬁcation scheme (e. g. other genes or metagenomes).
For bioinformaticians, Explicet offers a powerful means of rap-
idly evaluating and segmenting large microbial ecology datasets.
For non-bioinformaticians, a familiar easy-to-use mouse-driven
software application softens the training focus away from soft-
ware logistics and toward the microbiology and statistical meth-
ods that underpin microbial ecology. Practical use of Explicet in
several laboratory settings has been found to reduce the require-
ments for personnel with bioinformatics/computational expertise
(Hara et al., 2013; Markle et al., 2013; Robertson et al., 2013).
Consequently, the analysis of complex microbiome datasets is
now much more accessible to the growing number of investigators
who wish to bring a microbial ecological perspective to their ﬁelds
of interest, especially in medicine and the environmental sciences.

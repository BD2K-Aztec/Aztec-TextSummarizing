Abstract

Motivation: Kablammo is a web—based application that produces interactive, vector—based visual—
izations of sequence alignments generated by BLAST. These visualizations can illustrate many fea—
tures, including shared protein domains, chromosome structural modifications and genome

misassembly.

Availability and implementation: Kablammo can be used at http://kablamm0.wasmuthlab.0rg. For
a local installation, the source code and instructions are available under the MIT license at http://

github.com/jwintersinger/kablammo.

1 Introduction

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) rapidly finds simi-
lar subsequences shared between a query and database sequences
(Altschul et (11., 1997). Its uses include inferring homology from
shared sequence similarity, identifying the species associated with an
uncharacterized sequence, and locating domains shared between
proteins.

BLAST’s ease-of-use and diverse applications have made it a ubi-
quitous tool in molecular biology, especially for researchers without
extensive bioinformatics training. However, its output is predomin-
antly text-based. In our experience running training workshops,
non-bioinformaticians often have difficulty finding features of inter-
est, restricting BLAST to serving as a mere tool for identifying genes
or species. Various applications attempt to resolve this by providing
graphical interpretations of the BLAST results (Neumannet 111.,
2013), but these suffer important shortcomings.

The NCBI BLAST service (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) pro-
vides a simple visual summary of alignment results, but works only
for BLAST searches performed through the web service. The BLAST
Output Visualization tool (BOV) creates a static rather than inter-
active rendering of the BLAST alignments, renders only one query at
a time, and works only with BLAST version 2.2.24 or earlier, which
is almost four years out-of-date. We have tried other methods re-
viewed by Neumann et a1. (2013), finding that no single tool

satisfied our needs. To remedy these issues, we present Kablammo,
an application that leverages modern web technologies to produce
an expedient visual overview of BLAST results.

2 Implementation
2.1 Rapid BLAST result visualization

Kablammo visualizes BLAST results, permitting the identification of
domains shared between proteins, structural modifications to
chromosomes such as duplications and translocations, and technical
issues such as genome misassembly. The results of all queries used in
a BLAST run are rendered simultaneously and ordered by alignment
score, allowing the user to quickly obtain a visual overview. A given
query sequence and the matched database sequence are represented
by horizontal bars (Fig. 1). The trapezoids drawn between these
bars indicate the portions of the sequences that align to each other.
The quality of each alignment is indicated by the colour of its trapez-
oid, with stronger alignments shaded darker. The user may also se-
lect individual alignments to view BLAST parameters, including
sequence coordinates, reading frames, bit scores, and E values, as
well as the raw aligned sequences. Alignments can be filtered by E
value, bit score, length, and the names of subject or query sequences.
This allows the user to display only alignments exceeding a quality
threshold or those belonging to a particular gene family.

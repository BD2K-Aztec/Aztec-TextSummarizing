ABSTRACT

Motivation: The constraints under which sequence, structure and
function coevolve are not fully understood. Bringing this mutual rela-
tionship to light can reveal the molecular basis of binding, catalysis
and allostery, thereby identifying function and rationally guiding protein
redesign. Underlying these relationships are the epistatic interactions
that occur when the consequences of a mutation to a protein are
determined by the genetic background in which it occurs. Based on
prior data, we hypothesize that epistatic forces operate most strongly
between residues nearby in the structure, resulting in smooth evolu-
tionary importance across the structure.

Methods and Results: We find that when residue scores of evolu-
tionary importance are distributed smoothly between nearby residues,
functional site prediction accuracy improves. Accordingly, we
designed a novel measure of evolutionary importance that focuses
on the interaction between pairs of structurally neighboring residues.
This measure that we term pair-interaction Evolutionary Trace yields
greater functional site overlap and better structure-based proteome-
wide functional predictions.

Conclusions: Our data show that the structural smoothness of
evolutionary importance is a fundamental feature of the coevolution
of sequence, structure and function. Mutations operate on individual
residues, but selective pressure depends in part on the extent to which
a mutation perturbs interactions with neighboring residues. In practice,
this principle led us to redefine the importance of a residue in terms of
the importance of its epistatic interactions with neighbors, yielding
better annotation of functional residues, motivating experimental
validation of a novel functional site in LexA and refining protein func-
tion prediction.

function (Laskowski and Thornton, 2008), design drugs (Hardy
and Wells, 2004), engineer proteins (Thyme et al., 2009) and
predict protein function (Erdin et al., 2010). The experimental
gold standard to map these sites is alanine scanning (Clackson
and Wells, 1995; Onrust et al., 1997), but this approach is rarely
exhaustive and limited by the availability of biologically relevant
assays.

Therefore, complementary, inexpensive and scalable
approaches search for functional sites and residues by analyzing
the vast evolutionary record of protein sequences computation-
ally (Aloy et al., 2001; Buslje et al., 2010; Casari et al., 1995;
Engelen et al., 2009; Glaser et al., 2003; Halabi et al., 2009;
Innis, 2007; Pupko et al., 2002; Pazos et al., 2006; Valdar,
2002). The Evolutionary Trace (ET) (Lichtarge et al., 1996;
Mihalek et al., 2004) identiﬁes functionally important residue
positions by ﬁnding sequence substitution patterns correlated
with divergences among homologs, thereby explicitly taking
phylogenetic relationships into account. ET predictions have
been extensively validated experimentally (Onrust et al., 1997;
Rajagopalan et al., 2006; Ribes-Zamora et al., 2007; Rodriguez
et al., 2010; Shenoy et al., 2006; Sowa et al., 2000, 2001) and
through large-scale retrospective predictions of functional sites
Wao et al., 2003) and protein functions (Venner et al., 2010).
These studies point to a number of general and consistent obser-
vations in well-structured protein domains: (i) sequence positions
may be ranked by evolutionary importance; (ii) most important
sequence residues cluster structurally (Madabushi et al., 2002);
(iii) these structural clusters predict functional sites (Yao et al.,
2003), such that (iv) small structureifunction motifs called 3D
templates based on these clusters can predict protein function on
a genomic scale (Erdin et al., 2010; Kristensen et al., 2008;
Venner et al., 2010; Ward et al., 2008). The evolutionary prin-
ciples that give rise to these useful patterns remain unclear.

This work suggests that epistasis drives these patterns.
Traditionally, epistasis means interactions between genes; how-
ever, it is also recognized as a major force in molecular evolution
of individual proteins (Breen et al., 2012). Strong epistatic inter-
actions occur between contact residues (Ortlund et al., 2007),
presumably because function and adaptation are intimately
related to mutual interaction and variation of physically neigh-
boring residues. Indeed, improving the clustering quality of
evolutionarily important residues improves predictions of

Accounting for epistatic interactions improves functional analysis of protein structures

 

functional sites (Mihalek et al., 2006a, b; Wilkins et al., 2010). In
that light, the clustering of these residues simply reflects the fun-
damental epistatic coupling of neighbors.

These observations motivate a series of hypotheses. We
hypothesize that if epistasis and function constrain residue neigh-
bors during selective pressure, then evolutionary importance
should distribute smoothly over a protein structure. If so, opti-
mizing ET rank smoothness, for example, by selecting sequences
appropriately, should improve predictions of functional sites,
molecular determinants and functions. Thereby, a modified ET
algorithm could directly enforce smoothness and improve pre-
dictions by focusing primarily on epistatic interactions.

Our results show that, in practice, we can assess ET rank
smoothness by treating the structure as a network, or graph, of
amino acid nodes, linking these nodes by edges indicating
structural contact and applying the discrete Laplacian operator
from a graph theory to quantify ET smoothness. Selections of
input sequences that minimize the smoothing function con-
structed from the Laplacian operator then led to better func-
tional site analyses by ET. Moreover, a new inherently
smoother pair-interaction Evolutionary Trace (piET) algorithm
built to measure the importance of neighbor-to-neighbor residue
pairs, instead of single residues, improves functional site predic-
tions in retrospective study and in an experimental application
on Escherichia coli LexAia protein that triggers the SOS re-
sponse through which bacteria evolve drug resistance. Finally,
piET improves large-scale functional annotations. Together,
these data show that the smoothest structural distribution of
evolutionary importance reflects functional information best,
and that epistatic interactions are strongly reﬂective of the effect-
ive distance between residues.

2 METHODS

2.1 Measuring the smoothness of a rank distribution

To measure the smoothness of ET ranks over a protein, we treat the
structure as a graph. The nodes of this graph are the residues, and its
edges indicate adjacent sequence residues or close contacts in the known
structure. This focus on neighbors is because they will likely experience
most strongly the impact of a substitution. The Laplacian operator
(Chung, 1997) is the discrete graph counterpart of the standard
Laplacian operator used to measure smoothness in a continuous func-
tion, and it is computed with two matrices: the adjacency matrix, denoted
A, which speciﬁes which residues contact each other in the protein struc-
ture (within a minimum atomiatom distance of four Angstroms); and the
degree matrix, denoted D, which describes the number of residues
adjacent to residue 1'. Speciﬁcally, A is deﬁned as

residues 1', j in contact
otherwise

. . 1

An.» = {0 (1)
This simple form could eventually be made to account for the number

of atomiatom contacts, their apparent distances, electrochemical

propensities and other attributes of residue neighbor interactions. The

degree matrix, D, is a function of A(i, j)

2k A(i, k) ifi 2]"

0 otherwise

0021') = { (2)

The Laplacian operator L is then deﬁned as L = D — A. Following
standard practice, we may measure the smoothness of any vector ﬁeld
x distributed across the nodes of a graph deﬁned by A through the

quadratic form of its Laplacian (Chung, 1997), which is also referred to
as the smoothing function, and deﬁned by

xTLx = Z A(i, j)(x,- — x,)2 (3)
1,1

In this work, the vector ﬁeld x is the relative evolutionary importance
(ET rank) of each residue given by the real-value Evolutionary Trace
(rvET) algorithm (Mihalek et al., 2004), which measures the size of a
phylogenetic divergence associated with a substitution at each sequence
position. A short review of this algorithm can be found in Supplementary
Materials. By convention, lower values of xTLx indicate smoother distri-
butions of the x,- over the protein structure, meaning that the difference in

ET ranks is smaller between residues that are in contact.

2.2 Functional determinant test set

The dataset of functional determinants was taken from a previous work
(Wilkins et al., 2010). The gold standard functional sites for protein7
ligand interactions are deﬁned by the database PDBsum (Laskowski
et al., 2005). The proteiniprotein functional sites are the residues
within ﬁve Angstroms of the residues in the complexed proteins. To
obtain a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for each query protein, a
set of sequences was retrieved with BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) (using
NCBI’s non-redundant protein sequence database, the BLOSUM62 sub-
stitution matrix and default parameters). The top 500 homologs with an
e-value better than 0.05 were retrieved from NCBI/s Protein database.
After we generated alignments, the set was curated to remove sequences
with sequence identity <26% and length <70% when compared with
query. The homologues were then realigned after curation.

2.3 Measures of overlap and clustering

To assess the recovery of known functional sites in proteins, we calculate
an overlap z-score 2,, between top-ET ranked positions and the ‘gold
standard’ functional site, based on the hypergeometric distribution. We
ﬁrst calculate the mean m and the variance 02 of the hypergeometric
distribution

m = nA—l and 02 = n—MUV _ mm] _ n) (4)

N N2(N — n)

where N is deﬁned as the length of the query protein, M is the number of
residues that make up the functional site and n is the number of residues
that fall under a certain ET rank-coverage. We then calculate the hyper-
geometric z-score 2,, = “j”, where a is the actual number of functional
site residues at a particular ET rank. Each ET rank can be associated with
a distinct z-score. To access performance at multiple ranks, we developed
the overlap measure (20), which is the average z-score over ET ranks that
fall within a particular coverage range,

1 K
(20> = E2) 29 (5)

 

Typically, we ﬁnd that the most useful ET predictions are in the top
20%. 25,0 is the overlap z-score corresponding to the residues within a
certain ET percentile rank 1'. The sum is over K unique evolutionary ranks
for residues that fall within the top 20% cutoff. The measure of clustering
is calculated in a similar fashion, (2,.) =  22") where 22") are found
analytically and have already been discussed at length in Mihalek et al.,
(2003).

2.4 Sequence selection simulation

To test smoothing, 30 000 ET analyses ran on randomly constructed
MSAs. Each alignment starts from a default alignment (described in
previous section) from which randomly sequences are removed, such
that the number of sequences removed was randomly chosen between

25 and the total number of sequences in the starting alignment. The new
set of ET ranks leads to unique values of smoothing function xTLx and
average overlap z-score (20). The multiple ET analyses are binned based
on the value of the smoothing function xTLx. The average (20) was then
found for the individual bins to evaluate the correlation.

2.5 Residue—residue evolutionary importance

To motivate our approach, we reasoned that although mutations operate
on individual residues, natural selection ﬁlters these mutations based on
how they perturb molecular interactions. Hence, neighboring residues, i,
j, should share evolutionary constraints and their importance ranks
should be closely related as observed by the clustering of top-ranked
residues within proteins (Madabushi et al., 2002) and their mirroring
across molecular interfaces (Raviscioni et al., 2005). If so, we should
focus measures of importance directly on molecular interactions rather
than on individual residues. By measuring the evolutionary importance of
the link between residues, p(i, j), we could then infer the importance of i
from the average of p(i, j) over all its neighbors j. In essence, a residue’s
importance throughout evolution would be borne of its epistatic inter-
actions with neighboring residues. To implement this strategy and
compute the evolutionary importance of the link between two neighbor-
ing residues p(i, j), we followed an ET strategy. Residues ranked highly
by ET have been shown to knock out (Ribes-Zamora et al., 2007) or swap
functions (Rodriguez et al., 2010), while control mutations to poorly
ranked residues were neutral. We can extend this same approach to a
pair of residues, where the residue pair i : j is more informative if its
sequence variations (among 20 x 20 = 400 possible unique states) corres-
pond to greater evolutionary tree divergences, i.e. those that are closer to
the tree root. The piE T algorithm therefore applies the standard
rvET procedure to pairs of residues within the MSA, to measure these
residueresidue patterns in the context of the evolutionary tree. The evo-
lutionary importance of a structural neighbor pair i: j is denoted by
p(i, j) where,

400

N71 n
pa,» = 2%Zl — Zita,» 1n firm} (6)
:1 g:l ab:l

where fibU, j) is the frequency of the pair of an amino acid ab of a type
within group g of the sub-alignment in the n-th set of sub-alignments. The
number of possible nodes in the evolutionary tree is N 7 1 where N is the
number of sequences in the alignment. The factor % was adapted from a
previous study (Mihalek et al., 2004) to give weight to the individual sub-
alignments based on their location in the phylogenetic tree. The rvET
algorithm couples the phylogenetic tree to the pattern of variation of a
pair of residues, viewed as a single evolving unit (Supplementary Fig. Sl).
Once the importance of every pair is available, the piET rank 21(i) of an
individual residue i is calculated by averaging p(i, j) over all its neighbors,

W) = ﬁ;A(i,j)p(Lj) (7)

As previously deﬁned in Equation (2), D(i, i) is the number of residues
in contact with residue i (2k A(i, k)). This equation for 21(i) factors
shared evolution of the contact residues into the ET phylogenetic
framework.

2.6 Evolutionary trace annotation

To test the piET algorithm in a large-scale application, we substituted it
in place of rvET into the Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) algo-
rithm and asked whether it improved ETA predictions. ETA is a suite of
programs for automated discovery of protein function based on their
structure. It identiﬁes protein structures that may have identical
biochemical functions based on whether they share small structural
motifs composed of top-ranked ET residues (Erdin et al., 2010;

Kristensen et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2008). In brief, ETA deﬁnes structural
motifs by (i) mapping ET ranks onto the surface of a protein structure,
(ii) detecting clusters of important amino acids and (iii) selecting six
top-ranked amino acids from the cluster. The geometry of the alpha
carbon atoms of these six residues deﬁne a 3D template that is then
searched for, by geometric similarity, in the protein data bank (PDB)
(Berman et al., 2000). Speciﬁcity is enhanced by ﬁltering matches based
on evolutionary and structural similarity and ensuring that protein
structures match each other reciprocally. These matches are used to
construct a network, as previously described (Venner et al., 2010), in
which nodes are protein structures and edges indicate functional
similarity, as detected by the ETA algorithm. We label this network
with known functional information and use a diffusion model to control
the propagation of those labels through the network, leading to predic-
tions of function for protein structures currently lacking function anno-
tations. If using piET instead of rvET causes ETA predictions to
improve, it suggests that piET is a more useful metric of evolutionary
importance.

2.7 Functional annotation test set

The function annotation tests included past query and target sets
(Ward et al., 2008; Wilkins et al., 2010). The query set included 1217
structural genomics enzymes annotated to the third or fourth level of
the Enzyme Commission (EC) classiﬁcation. The target set is the subset
of the 2008PDB90 (Hobohm et al., 1992), which contains 17 234 proteins,
which contains 4387 enzymes with four-digit EC annotations. The com-
bination of the query and target sets resulted in a network of 17952
proteins among which 5105 are annotated as enzymes. Each protein in
the test set was assigned a single enzymatic function.

2.8 Network construction and diffusion

Networks were built and predictions followed as previously described
(Venner et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, an ETA template match was converted
into a real-valued (edge) weight by averaging the mean evolutionary
distance and the rmsd: w = 1 — [(rmsd — armsd)/ (rmsd + (ETScore — a
Emma/035mm]. ETA outputs an rmsd and ETScore for each template
match. ETScore summarizes the average difference in evolutionary
importance (ET Rank) between matched residues and rmsd is the average
distance between the atoms in the structures of the matched templates.
Additionally, armsd is the average rmsd over all template matches, (rmsd is
the standard deviation of all rmsds. Likewise, “ETScore is the average
ETScore over all template matches and (IE-[5mm is the standard deviation
of all ETScores.

Graph diffusion passes functional information between proteins that
share similar ETA templates (Venner et al., 2010). We can represent our
knowledge of protein enzymatic function as y, a vector of labels repre-
senting whether a protein i is associated with a particular EC number (yi).
Diffusion of the available information (in this case EC number) leads to a
new label, f. We can solve for f by minimizing the following:

(f — y)T(f — y) + MfTLf (8)

In this expression, the first term is the loss function and represents
the difference between initial and ﬁnal labels. The second term is the
smoothness of the new label f in the context of the Laplacian matrix
L. The diffusion coefﬁcient a balances the loss of the initial labels against
the smoothness. The previous equation has a closed form solution

f = (1+ MLYIy (9)

where I is the Identity matrix. The diffusion coefficient a is calculated as
previously shown (Venner et al., 2010).

2.9 Network integration
To test for complementary functional information in rvET and piET, the

networks were merged into a single network (Tsuda et al., 2005). We
perform diffusion with multiple networks by solving for

f= (1+ ZakLkrly (10)
k

where Lk represents the Laplacian form of network k. ark is weighting
factor that represents the importance of each network in the combination.
We can ﬁnd ark by minimizing yT(I + 62k akkaly. To simplify the
minimization problem, we set the additional restriction 011 +012 :1
(because in this case we have only two networks), and solved using the
brute force optimization procedure in the scientiﬁc python package
(SciPy: Jones, 2001). We are then able to solve for f for a particular y
vector that represents a speciﬁc enzymatic function (EC number). We
solve with a different y for each enzymatic function represented in the
network, thus associating every protein in the test set with every function.
To compare these values, we normalize to a z-score ((y, — ymcan)/ystd).
For each protein, the function with the highest z-score is our predicted
enzymatic function for that protein, and we use the z-score as a
conﬁdence measure in the prediction.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Smoothing the evolutionary importance rank
distribution improves functional site predictions

To test whether ET rank smoothness correlates with the quality
of functional site predictions, we applied the Laplacian operator
to the ET rank distributions on 74 diverse proteins bound to
various substrates, cofactors, DNA or proteins (see ‘Methods’
section). For each protein, a large number of alternative MSAs
was randomly generated from a default sequence alignment
(Fig. 1). This gave rise to multiple ET rank distributions, each
one with its unique smoothness, xTLx and overlap z—score
between top-ranked residues and the functional sites annotated
in the pdb files (details found in ‘Methods’ section). In most cases
(81%), the correlation was strong (Fig. 10). Exceptions included
ﬁve proteins with inverse correlations (>0.4) when the ET
clusters identiﬁed a functional site other than the one referenced
in the pdb ﬁle gold standard. For instance, in the rhodopsin
structure [PDBID 1f88], ET found the G—protein interaction
determinants instead of the retinal binding site noted in the
crystal structure (Berman et al., 2000). A specialized difference
ET analysis would be needed to identify that site, which is
speciﬁc to visual receptors (Madabushi et al., 2004). A few pro-
teins had small correlation because the functional site prediction
was robust and insensitive to the randomization procedure.
Nevertheless, averaging over all 74 proteins, including these
anomalies, the smoothest sequence selection improved the
smoothing function xTLx by 12.6%; it increased the traditional
clustering z—score (26) by 12.9%, and it raised the overlap
z-scores (20) by 8.6%. In a second sequence simulation
experiment (Supplementary Material), we found that the
number of sequences had little inﬂuence on the correlations
and improvement in functional site prediction. These data
show a strong association between improved functional site an-
notations and smoother distributions of evolutionary importance
rankings.

Fig. 1. To establish that smoother ET ranks are a desirable feature, we
showed that smoothness correlated with the quality of functional site
prediction. MSAs of proteins with known functional sites were rando-
mized by selecting a random number of sequences and then analyzed with
the rvET algorithm. Every variation in the alignment leads to a new
distribution of ET ranks and, in turn, a unique value of the smoothness
within the structure (XTLX) and functional site overlap measure ((20)).
The individual analyses were then binned and counted (black lines) based
on the value of xTLx where the average overlap measure ((20)) for the
analyses in each bin was found (green triangle). Higher (20) implies better
site prediction and lower xTLx implies a smoother distribution of ET
ranks over structure. In both cases there is a steady and strong improve-
ment in functional site overlap as smoothness increases, showed by the
average overlap z-score (20) for the corresponding bins in the histogram

default MSA (Blue) did not signiﬁcantly recover the known binding site,
whereas the smoother ET ranks from sequence selection did. (b) By con-
trast, in the example the structure for FeS cluster assembly protein suﬂ)
[PDBID 1vh4A, Ecoh], the default MSA (blue) is already smoother than
most of the randomly generated alternatives. (c) The value of the smooth-
ing function xTLx for the random input sequences correlates with func-
tional site overlap. The average correlation over the 74 proteins was

Fig. 2. Smoothing the distribution of ET ranks in the protein structure
improves the detection of functional residues. A set of 74 proteins was
tested for improvement in functional site detection with the piET
algorithm. The ﬁgure shows the consistent improvement in overlap
z-score (20) for the individual proteins in the test set

3.2 New Algorithm identiﬁes functional determinants

These results justiﬁed a search for an Evolutionary Trace algo-
rithm that is inherently smoother, dubbed piET, which was
benchmarked and compared with rvET on the same test set
used above Section 3.1. piET produced striking gains: 41%
better smoothing, evaluated with the quadratic form of the
Laplacian rose; 58% better clustering z—scores (26) among top-
ranked residues; and 23% better overlap z—score (20) against
known sites. These functional site prediction improvements
were generally consistent across proteins, Figure 2. Hence, the
recovery of functional sites improves signiﬁcantly with an algo-
rithm that measures the importance of residue interactions first,
and only deduces the importance of each residue second. This
strategy embodies the notion that smoothness is the byproduct of
shared evolutionary constraints among interacting residue neigh-
bors. Its success demonstrates that the phylogenomics of piET
brings correlated evolution to light, and that one of its hallmarks
is the structural smoothness of evolutionary importance.

To illustrate these gains in a speciﬁc example we next turned to
Hsp90, a eukaryotic chaperone critical for protein folding and
involved in cell cycle regulation, steroid hormone responsiveness
and signal transduction among many other processes. Its func-
tions depend on ATP hydrolysis and the crystallized structure
[PDBID 1am1] identiﬁes the ATPiADP binding sites. Although
rvET identiﬁed some residues proximal to this site involved in
ATP hydrolysis, piET identiﬁes a much larger evolutionarily
important site in that region (Fig. 3a), and the overlap z—score
(20) increased more than 2-fold ((20) = 1.91 to 4.39). In fact,
piET also outperforms the rvET optimized by choosing the
smoothest outcome after randomization of the sequence input.
In a second example, piET predicted the proteiniprotein inter-
face for the growth hormone and hormone receptor complex
[PDBID 1a22] better. Although the rvET had picked important
residues in this functional region of the growth hormone, the
evolutionary important site with piET is better resolved
(Fig. 3b) and statistically more significant ((20) = 0.625 to
2.51). In a third example, rvET found the dimer site of the
suﬂ) structure [PDBID 1vh4] well, and no randomization of

the input sequences could improve this result. Yet, piET sharply
raises the statistical significance of the site ((20) = 6.97 to 8.95),
Supplementary Figure S3. These representative examples show
that piET is inherently smoother than rvET, and that this trans-
lates into better clustering among top-ranked ET residues and
better functional site identification.

3.3 Highlighting functional regions in LexA

To demonstrate functional site prediction, piET was next focused
on LexA, a well-studied protein that regulates the SOS response
to DNA damage in E.coli (Butala et al., 2009). On direct inter-
action with recombinase A (RecA), LexA dimers self-cleave their
DNA binding domain and thus lift transcriptional repression of
more than 40 genes, including some that mediate error-prone
DNA repair and subsequent escape from genotoxic stress
(Butala et al., 2009). The DNA binding and catalytic sites of
LexA have been identiﬁed but not its RecA interaction site.
Although recently rvET suggested a novel composite LexA bind-
ing site on RecA (Adikesavan et al., 2011), no such candidate site
is apparent on LexA.

First, piET improved the identiﬁcation of the known DNA
binding site and active site of LexA. While rvET for the most
part does not find a cluster of top-ranked residues at the DNA
binding site, except for a few nearby residues (Fig. 4a, left panel),
piET fully recovers that site (Fig. 4a, right panel). The statistical
significance of these predictions (Supplementary Fig. S4) were
similar regardless of whether the reference LexA structures was
bound to DNA (as in PDBID 3jsp) or not (as in PDBID 1jhh).
Moreover, this improvement is not at the expense of loss of ET
signal elsewhere in the protein: piET identiﬁes the catalytic active
site even better than rvET (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, pre-
viously characterized sites of LexA are better resolved by piET.

Next, we considered a small novel cluster of residues on the
LexA structure identiﬁed by piET, shown in Figure 4b. piET
ranked these residues as 14% more evolutionarily important
(rmsd is 3%) on average than rvET. They are in immediate con-
tact with each other and form a tight cluster, therefore fulﬁlling a
hallmark of a functional site not previously recognized.
Previously, a single E170V mutation at this site proved import-
ant for LexA self cleavage (Lin and Little, 1989). To extend this
observation, we performed additional mutations within the
piET-identiﬁed site neighboring E170. These mutations dis-
turbed LexA function in response to ultraviolet-induced DNA
damage, confirming that these residues form a previously unrec-
ognized LexA functional site (Fig. 40). Together these data show
that piET pinpoints functional residues and active sites signiﬁ-
cantly better than rvET, even in a complex multifunctional pro-
tein. In LexA, this leads to the discovery of a novel functional
site, possibly pointing to a binding site for RecA.

3.4 piET improves annotation of enzymatic function

To test whether piET also captures functional information on a
large scale, we constructed separate function prediction networks
with rvETiETA and piETiETA. These contained 17952 pro-
teins (nodes), and 115784 and 114542 ETA matches (edges) in
the piET and rvET networks, respectively. The diffusion model
(Venner et al., 2010) predicted enzymatic function and conﬁ-
dence scores on a test set of 1070 structural genomics enzymes

with existing annotations, based on 5105 annotated proteins in
the network. Whenever possible, these predictions were up to the
fourth level EC number, which describes not only the chemical
reaction but also its substrate. In this test, the piET algorithm

performed slightly better, with a small improvement (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S5) in area under the curve (A UCPiET = 0.921
compared with AUCrvET = 0.914).

To test whether these piET and rvET networks were redun-
dant or complementary, we merged them into a single network
(Tsuda et al., 2005). This method creates a weighted combination
based on the connectivity of the individual Laplacian matrices
and without need for training. The network mixture coefﬁcients
were arvET = 0.37 and aim-ET = 0.63. The first incorrect prediction
of this combined network occurs at 8.1% coverage, and it is
preceded by 86 correct ones (Supplementary Fig. S5). By con-
trast, the ﬁrst incorrect prediction the rvET or piET networks
alone occurred at 30 and 31, respectively. This is of practical
importance, as the high conﬁdence predictions are generally
the ones we would act on experimentally. The individual algo-
rithms mix in mistakes sooner, and by merging networks we can
reduce mistakes. At 100% coverage, the merged network method
was 4.3% more accurate and the area under the curve improved
to AUCWEHPiET = 0.945. Both the rvET and the piET
algorithms for detecting evolutionary importance focus the
ETA on different but complementary functional sites. ETA per-
formed best when the algorithms were integrated, showing that
each algorithm is providing relevant but unique functional
information.

4 DISCUSSION

This study adds in three signiﬁcant ways to a long-term effort to
identify functional sites. First, we show that the spatial
distribution of evolutionary information (measured here by ET
rank) in a folded structure is smooth. This complements the

original notion of ET clusters (Lichtarge et al., 1996) with a
mathematically simple interpretation that lends itself to compu-
tation via the Laplacian operator of a graph. This discrete
Laplacian operator is fundamental to networks (Chung, 1997),
and here it enables optimization in sequence selection better than
the diverse measures of clustering used before (Wilkins et al.,
2010). These were entirely empirical and useful to suggest the
simplifying notion of smoothness. We show when we consider
the functional linkage between residues, we can better interpret
sequence information.

The second improvement builds on this notion of smoothness
to develop an algorithm that focuses on a residue’s interactions
with neighbors. The method first scores the importance of these
interactions and then averages over the neighbor interactions to
give the total importance of each residue. This is consistent with
prior suggestions (Gutteridge et al., 2003; Raviscioni et al., 2005)
that natural selection operates based less on the intrinsic charac-
ter of an amino acid, than on the nature of its couplings to other
residues, here primarily those in its immediate surrounding.
Previous studies have noted improvement in predictions when
they average evolutionary information for residues over
sequence (Capra and Singh, 2007; Pei and Grishin, 2001) and
structure (Panchenko et al., 2004; Teppa et al., 2012). We add to
this work by quantifying the shared evolutionary pattern be-
tween residues near in structure. These interactions are the
essence of the residue’s function. Though the method is currently
limited to structural information, we can use the constantly im-
proving homology-modeling algorithms (Roy et al., 2010) or
databases of pre—computed homology models (Bordoli and
Schwede, 2012).

Third, we show how these results follow logically from epistatic
interaction among residues. Other methods focused on pairwise
interactions via covariation (Pazos and Valencia, 2008), thermo-
dynamic (Maksay, 2011) or energetic coupling (de la Lande et al.,
2010). Networks of such correlations often lead to clusters of
pathways although their interpretation is not straightforward
(Chi et al., 2008). By contrast, clusters of ET residues lead to
functional sites shown independently to be highly signiﬁcant com-
pared with other methods [see Supplementary Materials in
Rausell et al. 2010, and extensively tested experimentally in a
large variety of proteins (Lichtarge and Wilkins, 2010)]. These
validations included mapping and then recoding of allosteric
determinants of both interprotein and intraprotein signaling path-
ways (Rodriguez et al., 2010).

In summary, this work finds and exploits the fact that epistatic
forces mold evolution and, as a result, leads to the smooth dis-
tribution of evolutionary importance throughout protein struc-
tures. This smoothness stems from the functional linkage of
residues typically nearby in conformation, a hallmark of epista-
sis. This basic property leads to new algorithms for computing
the evolutionary importance of (a) residueiresidue interaction
among neighbors, and (b) individual residues. In turn, this sub-
stantially improves functional site analysis and function predic-
tion in test sets while also veriﬁed experimentally by predicting a
novel site in LexA. This should prove useful in guiding protein
engineering and mutations to the most relevant parts of a
protein. A server performing piET calculations is available at

ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput sequencing technologies enable the
genome-wide analysis of the impact of genetic variation on molecular
phenotypes at unprecedented resolution. However, although power-
ful, these technologies can also introduce unexpected artifacts.
Results: We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on
the identiﬁcation of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-
throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipi-
tation assays (ChlP-seq). Putative AS DNA binding activity for RNA
polymerase II was determined using ChlP-seq data derived from lym-
phoblastoid cell lines of two parent—daughter trios. We found that, at
high-sequencing depth, many significant AS binding sites suffered
from an amplification bias, as evidenced by a larger number of
clonal reads representing one of the two alleles. To alleviate this
bias, we devised an amplification bias detection strategy, which filters
out sites with low read complexity and sites featuring a significant
excess of clonal reads. This method will be useful for AS analyses
involving ChlP-seq and other functional sequencing assays.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has
enabled us to study the relationship between genomic variants
and various molecular phenotypes at single basepair resolution.
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying allele-speciﬁc
(AS) gene regulation, such as those affected by cis—regulatory
variants (Montgomery et al., 2010; Pickrell et al., 2010), several

studies have started to probe allele- or individual-speciﬁc changes
in transcription factor (TF) binding and chromatin states
(Degner et al., 2012; Kasowski et al., 2010; Kilpinen et al.,
2013; McDaniell et al., 2010; Reddy et al., 2012), revealing that
such changes are abundant and often correlate with gene expres-
sion differences.

To detect these changes, specialized computational workﬂows
have been developed to eliminate several possible sources of bias
inherently linked to the analysis of AS behavior. Although the
analysis may seem straightforward, several technical hurdles
need to be overcome to ensure reliable results. These include,
for example, the reference allele mapping bias, i.e. the tendency
of reads to map more frequently/better to the reference allele
than the alternative allele (Degner et al., 2009; McDaniell
et al., 2010; Rozowsky et al., 2011), biases linked to duplicated
genomic regions (Pickrell et al., 2010; Rozowsky et al., 2011),
quality of genotype calls (Rozowsky et al., 2011), or the statis-
tical tests used (Montgomery and Dermitzakis, 2011; Rozowsky
et al., 2011).

Here, using RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion assay (ChIP) sequencing data from two parentwlaughter
trios from the 1000 genomes project, we studied another signifi-
cant source of bias, namely, library ampliﬁcation, which can
introduce a large number of false-positive AS DNA binding
(ASB) events. To address this bias, we developed a two-tiered
ampliﬁcation bias detection strategy that filters out many of
these likely false-positive sites and greatly improves the overall
reliability of the data. This pipeline should prove useful for many
studies aiming to use ChIP—sequencing (ChIP—seq) technology to
identify AS molecular changes (e.g. in proteiniDNA binding
or chromatin structure).

2 METHODS

2.1 RNA polymerase H ChIP—seq dataset

RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq data for two parentidaughter trios was
obtained from Kilpinen et a]. (2013). Brieﬂy, we used 5 x 107 cross-linked
lymphoblastoid cells for chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments

with an anti-RPB2 antibody (so-67318, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
ChIP-seq library preparation was performed using the Illumina ChIP-
seq DNA Sample Prep Kit with 10.5 ng of puriﬁed ChIP-DNA. ChIP-
DNA libraries were ampliﬁed using 18 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
cycles, according to manufacturers instructions, and sequencing was per-
formed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine (36-bp read length, single
end) with one sample per lane. ChIP-seq reads were aligned against the
standard th9 build of the human reference genome with BWA 0.5.9 [Li
and Durbin (2009); default settings]. For sequencing depth simulations,
we randomly sampled 2&200 million mapped reads in 25 million steps
using samtools (View -s; seed 2 0). Reads with mapping quality <10 were
discarded for AS binding analysis.

2.2 Read clonality simulations

We simulated 36-bp reads around heterozygous single nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) sites to obtain a better sense about clonal signals. In
total, 200 datasets with 1000 artiﬁcial sites each were created, whereby
172000 reads were simulated per site. Each simulated dataset contained
between 0 and 99.5% clonal reads in 0.05% steps (thus resulting in 200
simulation sets). We deﬁne a clonal read as being the product of the PCR
library ampliﬁcation step during sequencing library preparation. For ex-
ample, a simulation with 100 reads/SNP site and a deﬁned clonal popu-
lation of 10% indicates that the site is covered by 90 independent reads
and 10 clonal reads produced during the PCR ampliﬁcation step. To
obtain an empirical distribution of read alignment start sites around
SNPs, we randomly placed all independent reads (out of all simulated
reads) on the plus or minus strand around a SNP site. The maximum
number of unique alignment read start sites for 36-bp reads is 72 (i.e.
2 x 36 bp). We naively assumed that each alignment position around a
SNP site has an equal probability of being covered, i.e. we did not con-
sider mappability biases, short-read alignment artifacts, or positional ef-
fects. Within each simulated dataset and for each SNP read depth value,
we counted the number of unique read alignment start sites (URSS).

2.3 Estimation of ChIP—seq library clonality based on
clonality simulations

For each simulated dataset and SNP read depth bin, we calculated the
mean number of URSSs for all 1000 simulated SNP sites. To estimate the
clonality (i.e. proportion of clonal reads at SNP sites) of an actual ChIP-
seq library, we ﬁrst obtained the distribution of URSSs for all tested
heterozygous SNP sites [i.e. heterozygous SNPs covered by at least 20
reads and ﬁltered for other artifacts; see Kilpinen et a]. (2013)]. From the
observed URSS distribution, we calculated for each SNP read depth bin
the mean number of URSSs. SNP read depth bins with <5 SNPs were
discarded from further analysis. We then selected the best clonality simu-
lation model by comparing all simulated mean URSS distributions
against the observed average URSS distribution using the
Kolmogorovismirnov (KS) test implemented in the R statistical software
(stats package, ks. test function; http://www.r-project.org). The simulation
model with the lowest D statistic was selected as the best clonality model.

2.4 Alternative estimation of ChIP—seq library clonality

Within each ChIP-seq library we counted the genome-wide number of
URSSs (NURSS) and the total number of mapped reads (Nreads). The
overall clonality of a ChIP-seq library was approximated with
1 _ NURSS/Nreadr-

2.5 Global ampliﬁcation bias SNP ﬁlter

The global ﬁlter is sequencing-depth independent and ﬂags any site that is
covered by reads with less than N URSS, whereby N ranges between 1 to
(2 x read length). It is a priori unknown which cutoff yields the best trade-
off between removing putative ampliﬁcation-biased sites and retaining

real sites. Our clonality simulation results show that for highly clonal
libraries (>95% clonality), the number of URSSs is on average below
ﬁve at sites covered by up to 100 reads. Therefore, we required that at
least five URSSs should be covered by reads irrespective of read depth
and library clonality.

2.6 Local ampliﬁcation bias SNP ﬁlter

Based on the best clonality simulation model (see Section 2.3), we have
tested for each accessible SNP (minimum 20 reads/site) whether the
number of observed URSSs over both alleles deviates signiﬁcantly from
our expectations of having at least a certain number of URSSs. Using the
clonality simulations, we drew for each site the expected distribution of
URSSs and ﬂagged SNPs as ampliﬁcation-biased if the observed URSS
value was equal or lower than the 50th element (out of 1000) of the sorted
simulated URSS distribution (thus corresponding to an one-tailed P-
value cutoff of 0.05). In addition, we performed power calculations by
testing whether the proposed local (joint-allele) ﬁlter is able to identify
instances where only one allele experiences an ampliﬁcation bias and the
second allele behaves as expected. We ran simulations for scenarios where
a signiﬁcant allelic imbalance (allelel /allele2) is >1 .5-fold (and >2-fold) at
sites covered by 204100 reads (P<0.01). These parameters represent the
observed range of read depth at SNP sites (i.e. 90% of accessible sites
were covered by <400 reads) as well as allelic imbalances (i.e. 90% of all
signiﬁcant sites had an allelic imbalance of >1.5-fold). The simulations
were performed for libraries with low (10%), intermediate (50%) and
high fractions of clonal reads (90%). We only considered the worst-
case scenarios in which the alternative allele behaves without any bias
and that reads mapping to the reference allele cover URSSs that are not
shared with URSSs from the alternative allele, thus decreasing the like-
lihood that the joint-allele ﬁlter can detect a biased site. The latter as-
sumption is often negated at sites that are covered by many unique reads
(i.e. #URSS-ref-allele+#URSS-alt-allele >72). For each simulated site,
we calculated the number of required URSSs at which the joint-allele
ﬁlter ﬂags a site as ampliﬁcation biased. The resulting fold difference in
the number of URSSs required to ﬂag a site (i.e. #URSS-allele-speciﬁc-
ﬁlter/#URSS-joint—allele-filter) indicates to what extent an AS bias needs
to be more pronounced to be detectable with the joint-allele ﬁlter.

2.7 Genomic distribution of AS binding sites

We used the GENCODE transcript annotation version 8 (Harrow et al.,
2012) to identify SNPs located within promoters of protein-coding tran-
scripts. We deﬁned the promoter region of transcripts as :l:1 kb around
transcription start sites.

3 RESULTS

In the context of a large-scale project aiming to study allelic
variability of gene regulatory processes (Kilpinen et al., 2013),
we generated genome-wide RNA polymerase II DNA binding
proﬁles from two parentidaughter trios sequenced as part of the
1000 genomes project (pilot 2) using ChIP—seq and targeting the
second largest RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2 (POLR2B).
We obtained on average 227 million reads/individual (36bp,
single end; Section 2.1), of which 73% were usable for AS ana-
lysis. To identify ASB activity within individuals, i.e. preferential
binding of POLR2B to the maternal or paternal allele, we
focused on 57 241 regions (peaks) that showed significant
POLR2B enrichment (Kilpinen et al., 2013).

We tested for ASB at heterozygous SNP sites (1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2010) that were located within POLR2B
peaks. Only SNPs covered by at least 20 reads/individual were

considered. This initial set of putative ASB sites was further fil-
tered for sites susceptible to various sources of artifacts, such as
incorrect or poor mapping of reads containing SNPs (Kilpinen
et al., 2013; Montgomery et al., 2010). For each SNP site, we
counted the number of overlapping reads carrying either the ref-
erence or alternative allele and applied a modiﬁed binomial test
that corrects for the reference allele mapping bias (Kilpinen et al.,
2013; Montgomery et al., 2010) on the read count data to iden-
tify sites with a signiﬁcant deviation from the null hypothesis of
equal DNA binding. Among 208274446 accessible SNPs/individ—
ual, we identiﬁed 3L53% signiﬁcant ASB events (P<0.01).
These results suggest that variability in POLR2B binding is ex-
tensive and consistent with earlier observations (Kasowski et al.,
2010; Reddy et al., 2012).

However, after plotting the reference allele ratio, i.e. the frac-
tion of reads carrying the reference as opposed to the alternative
allele at SNP sites, we observed a surprising and substantial bias
toward monoallelic (MA) or near-MA DNA binding with vary-
ing levels across individuals (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S1), a
ﬁnding that to our knowledge has not been reported in ASB
studies so far. More specifically, 8735% of the statistically sig-
niﬁcant ASB sites demonstrated MA DNA binding, and the
fraction of MA ASB sites increased using more stringent
P—Value cutoffs (e.g. 1242% at P: 0.001; 1749% at
P=0.0001) (Fig. 2A). The varying levels of MA sites across
the six individuals might either point to an important, yet
poorly characterized biological effect (Gimelbrant et al., 2007),
or might simply reﬂect a technical artifact, as we sequenced each
library on a single lane of Illumina HiSeq2000 machine, resulting
in high sequencing depth.

Because many known biases were already accounted for in
Kilpinen et a]. (2013), we looked for alternative causes that
might lead to highly signiﬁcant MA DNA binding activity.
First, we noticed that only 10% of all significant MA sites
were located on the X chromosome in females and MA binding
occurred in males as well, thus refuting a simple hypothesis that
the majority of MA sites are due to X chromosome inactivation
mechanisms (McDaniell et al., 2010). We observed that total

read depth at autosomal signiﬁcant MA ASB sites (P< 0.01)
was 3-fold lower than at biallelic sites, suggesting that sequencing
depth may affect the detection of MA binding events
(Supplementary Fig. S2). To explore this topic further, we ran-
domly sampled 2&200 million mapped reads (in incremental 25
million steps) from two POLR2B libraries that showed the stron-
gest MA bias and observed that the proportion of MA sites
among all tested sites increased with sequencing depth
(Supplementary Fig. S3). For example, the proportion of MA
sites was up to 10-fold lower in a low (25 million) compared with
a high (200 million) sequencing depth library. These results illus-
trate that the observed MA bias is at least in part related to
sequencing depth. However, we noted that the proportion of
MA sites was sample-speciﬁc because 2720% of signiﬁcant
MA sites exhibited high depth (>50 reads), which means that
this bias cannot be avoided by simply increasing the read
depth threshold at which sites are considered for ASB analysis.

Therefore, we further inspected the local read alignment dis-
tribution around putative ASB sites, which revealed that many
sites are covered by an unexpectedly high number of clonal
reads, i.e. reads mapping to the same strand and having an iden-
tical alignment start position (Fig. 2B). This might substantially
bias the read count toward one allele. More speciﬁcally, 1&84%
and L20% of all signiﬁcant MA and biallelic sites were covered

by only three or fewer unique reads, respectively. Grouping all
testable sites by their number of URSSs and calculating for each
URSS bin the proportion of signiﬁcant ASB events further illu-
strated this trend (Supplementary Fig. S4). Sites with few URSSs
correspond to highly biased ASB sites, as 94, 60, 50 and 48% of
those with only 1, 2, 3 or 4 URSSs were predicted as signiﬁcant,
respectively.

To better understand and to account for this bias, we assessed
the clonality of each of the six ChIP—seq libraries, which is a
direct measure of the library complexity. For this purpose, we
calculated how many URSSs could be expected within a region
spanning twice the read length centered on an SNP site, given a
certain assumed percentage of clonal (duplicate) reads at each
site, and a speciﬁc SNP read depth (Fig. 3A). Speciﬁcally, we
simulated sets of SNP sites with a broad range of read depth
values (172000 reads) and various degrees of clonal signals
(W99.5% per site), thus creating an empirical distribution of
URSSs (Section 2.2). Figure 3B shows the distribution of mean
URSSs profiles across all 1000 simulated sites for different read
depth values and clonality simulation models. For example, at an
SNP site covered by exactly 20 reads, we would expect 17 URSSs
when all reads are independent, but only two URSSs when 90%
of the read population is clonal. These results indicate that low
library complexity might lead to the presence of many sites with
high depth, albeit with little positional variability around the
SNP site, and as such constituting a likely source of strong
bias in ASB analysis.

To further explore this phenomenon across real ChIP—seq
libraries, we plotted for each individual the actual total read
depth and number of URSSs per heterozygous SNP site. To
our surprise, we observed considerable variation across libraries
in the number of URSS per SNP (Fig. 3C), despite being
sequenced to approximately similar depth. For example, SNPs
accessible for ASB analysis and covered by exactly 50 reads are
on average composed of 4e13 non-clonal reads/individual. This
variability in independent ChIP—DNA fragments at putative
ASB sites leads most likely to different levels of support for
the actual ASB event, as many signiﬁcant ASB sites are covered
by few non-clonal reads or exhibit an unexpectedly low number
of non-clonal reads even at high read depth levels. Importantly,
this bias cannot be addressed by simply choosing a higher min-
imum read depth cutoff per site, as the degree of clonality varies
widely from library to library (Supplementary Fig. S5; discussed
in more detail later in the text). Therefore, this bias may have
strong inﬂuence on any downstream ASB analysis, as the overall
confidence in those ASB sites is rather low.

One potential and simple strategy to deal with this problem is
to remove all clonal reads. However, such a strategy would lead
to a situation where, for 36-bp reads, the maximal read depth per
site would be 72 and the corresponding smallest statistically
detectable allelic imbalance would be 1.96-fold at P< 0.01 (bino-
mial test). As such, removing all duplicate reads would result in
70 (median) signiﬁcant ASB sites per individual (P<0.01), which
would decrease the total number of ASB sites by >90% com-
pared with the original and ﬁltered set of sites. Thus, removing
clonal reads substantially reduces the statistical power to detect
moderate effect ASB events.

We next studied the degree of clonality of the actual libraries
and determined a best ﬁt between our simulated URSS and the

the KS test for equality of the simulated versus the observed
mean URSS distributions. The simulated distribution that
yields the lowest KS statistic indicates the clonality of the
actual ChIP—seq library (Section 2.3). Using this workﬂow, we
determined that the genome-wide clonality of the six ChIP—seq
libraries ranged between 73 and 91% (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Thus, these libraries feature a high number of clonal reads due to
deep sequencing, further emphasizing the need to account for
this substantial bias. To validate our simulations, we determined
an independent measure of the extent of clonality (Section 2.4).
The Spearmans rank correlation coefﬁcient between both esti-
mates of library complexity revealed a high consistency
(p : 0.989, P: 1.9e-4). We then identiﬁed ASB sites that feature
a signiﬁcantly greater number of mapped clonal reads than ex-
pected based on the determined library-speciﬁc clonality model.
Biased sites, as indicated earlier in the text, have a high tendency
to survive the signiﬁcance test for AS binding.

We devised a two-tiered, global and local ﬁltering strategy to
account for the amplification bias. The global ﬁlter is sequencing
depth independent and ﬂags any site that is covered by reads

with less than a speciﬁed number of URSS (Section 2.5). For
the POLR2B datasets, requiring at least five URSSs per SNP site
removed the majority of highly biased ASB events, i.e. on aver-
age 1743% of all accessible ASB sites and 2792% of all MA sites
per individual. The local ﬁlter is sequencing depth dependent and
ﬂags sites that show an unexpected low number of URSSs.
Given the library-speciﬁc clonality simulations, we can model
the expected URSS distribution for each read depth bin (17
2000) and test whether the observed number of URSSs per
SNP site is within the expected range of URSSs. This approach
ﬂags sites as ampliﬁcation-biased that are within the left tail of
the empirical URSS distribution (i.e. having significantly fewer
URSSs than expected). Because the local ﬁlter models URSSs
over both alleles jointly, we have performed additional simula-
tions to test if the joint-allele ﬁlter is able to identify sites when
only a single allele experiences an amplification bias (Section
2.6). Dependent on the read depth per site and library clonality,
we observed that the joint-allele strategy detects a pure AS bias if
the ampliﬁcation bias is only borderline above the threshold of
an AS ﬁlter (Supplementary Fig. S6). After applying the local
ﬁlter on the POLR2B libraries, we identified that an additional
772% of all tested sites exhibit an excess of clonal reads and
thus likely constitute biased sites. Together, both ﬁlters (local
and global) ﬂagged 19751% of all initially tested SNPs per
individual as showing low-complexity read alignment start site
patterns around SNP sites (Fig. 4A), thus revealing that low-
complexity biases are common in the tested libraries. After
removing these sites, we observed that the reference allele ratio
distribution exhibited only few sites with MA binding behavior
per individual (2.4e3.9%; Fig. 4B). The filtered set of SNPs
showed at 38, 27 and 20% allelic effects (median across individ-
uals) at P-Value cutoffs of 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively
(binomial test). In contrast to the original set of sites, MA sites
accounted for only 540% of all signiﬁcant ASB events at
P<0.01. Importantly, not all MA sites should be considered as
false positives. MA gene expression is a known biological process
and can be caused, for example, by parent-of-origin silencing of
autosomal genes (imprinting), random gene silencing, or X-in—
activation in females (Gimelbrant et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012),
although it is clear that such events should only constitute a
small portion of all ASB events and not the majority as observed
before filtering. In this regard, it is worth noting that in com-
parison with signiﬁcant post-ﬁltered ASB sites, pre-ﬁltered MA
sites are depleted from promoters (54 and 16%). This suggests
that biased MA binding events for POLR2B might reﬂect sto-
chastic transcription events that tend to be covered by few DNA
fragments and become Visible as MA at high sequencing depth.

Finally, we set out to provide validation for our proposed
ﬁltering approach. First, we tested if allelic directions are con-
sistent at shared signiﬁcant ASB sites between two unrelated
individuals (McDaniell et al., 2010) and whether the consistency
improves after removing biased sites (Fig. 5A). The analysis
shows that, although the consistency in allelic direction is
highly significant for all tested sites (p:0.28, P: 1.2e-11;
Spearman correlation test), it substantially improves after remov-
ing biased sites (p:0.46, P:9.6e-16), consistent with it being
lower for biased sites alone (p:0.14, P:0.02). Second, we
tested whether two independent, phased and signiﬁcant SNP
sites located within the same 200 bp POLR2B peak show

consistent behavior in allelic direction. To avoid artiﬁcial correl-
ations, we only considered SNP pairs separated by 377200 bp.
We observed that the allelic direction of sites located within the
same peak is strongly correlated (p : 0.58, P : 2.2e-16). In agree-
ment with results from the previous analysis, we found that this
correlation is greater for unbiased SNP pairs than for pairs in
which one or both sites are biased (0:071 and p:0.42,
P: 2.2e-16 and 1.4e-6, respectively) (Fig. 5B). Both analyses re-
mained valid even after excluding sites that reached significance
without duplicate reads (data not shown). Therefore, these
results support the validity of ASB analysis using clonal reads
as well as the effectiveness in identifying biased sites with our
filtering approach.

4 DISCUSSION

It is now well recognized that high-throughput sequencing assays
are susceptible to significant, often non-intuitive artifacts when
used to detect AS molecular events (Degner et al., 2009; Pickrell
et al., 2011; Rozowsky et al., 2011). Here we report another such
artifact intrinsic to deeply sequenced ChIP—seq libraries and
likely other sequencing assays subject to PCR ampliﬁcation of
a small amount of starting material. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate
that on identifying putative sites with AS POLR2B occupancy,
we retain a clear excess number of sites that exhibit monoallelic
DNA binding behavior. We show that many of these sites suffer
from PCR ampliﬁcation biases, likely introduced during stand-
ard Illumina library preparation. In a systematic study of base-
composition biases in Illumina sequencing libraries, PCR during
library preparation was identiﬁed as the principal bias source
(Aird et al., 2011). Although experimental strategies have been
proposed to reduce this bias, it is widely accepted that it will be
difficult to completely eliminate it, unless PCR ampliﬁcation is
avoided altogether. However, PCR-free libraries require a sub-
stantial amount of input material, rendering this rather unfeas-
ible for approaches such as ChIP—seq where the sample material
is often limiting (Deplancke, 2009). Consequently, PCR ampliﬁ-
cation bias should be accounted for when using ChIP—seq to
detect AS molecular events involving transcription factors, co-
factors, and histone modiﬁcations. As observed in Kilpinen et al.
(2013), all ChIP—seq libraries suffered from this bias, although
the extent differed substantially between factors and libraries
with 8726% (ﬁrst and third quartile) of all accessible heterozy-
gous SNP sites exhibiting low read alignment complexity across
nine additional assays profiled in the same individuals as
POLR2B. The later analysis included a previously published
dataset on CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding (McDaniell
et al., 2010) in which 11% of all accessible sites for AS analysis
were ﬂagged as biased. Here we show that one of the sources of
this bias is sequencing depth given that the proportion of MA
binding events increases with increasing sequencing depth. One
simple strategy to deal with this issue is to simply remove all
clonal reads from the dataset (Chen et al., 2012; Heap et al.,
2010). However, previous and our own studies demonstrate
that many clonal reads likely constitute true signals (Chen
et al., 2012). Removing all duplicate reads from the POLR2B
libraries leads to a strong reduction in the overall number of
significant ASB sites as well as to a depletion in sites with mod-
erate ASB signals. Irrespective of the strategy, removing all

Filtering amplification-biased sites

 

clonal reads seems a rather overly cautious way of bypassing the
PCR ampliﬁcation bias and is in fact counterproductive as it
lowers the overall statistical power to detect ASB sites and un-
necessarily discards much of the sequencing data.

5 CONCLUSION

We have presented a method to identify and reduce the bias of
clonal amplification in AS analysis of ChIP—seq data. This ap-
proach analyzes the read alignment distribution around het-
erozygous SNP sites and removes highly clonal, low-
complexity sites based on expectations about the distribution
of reads covering SNP sites. Given the current interest in under-
standing the interplay between DNA variants and gene regula-
tion, this approach should be of general interest.

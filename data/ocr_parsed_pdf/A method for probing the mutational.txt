ABSTRACT

Motivation: Proteins of all kinds can self-assemble into highly
ordered B-sheet aggregates known as amyloid fibrils, important
both biologically and clinically. However, the specific molecular
structure of a fibril can vary dramatically depending on sequence and
environmental conditions, and mutations can drastically alter amyloid
function and pathogenicity. Experimental structure determination has
proven extremely difficult with only a handful of NMR-based models
proposed, suggesting a need for computational methods.

Results: We present AmyloidMutants, a statistical mechanics
approach for de novo prediction and analysis of wild-type and mutant
amyloid structures. Based on the premise of protein mutational
landscapes, AmyloidMutants energetically quantifies the effects of
sequence mutation on fibril conformation and stability. Tested on
non-mutant, full-length amyloid structures with known chemical
shift data, AmyloidMutants offers roughly 2-fold improvement in
prediction accuracy over existing tools. Moreover, AmyloidMutants
is the only method to predict complete super-secondary structures,
enabling accurate discrimination of topologically dissimilar amyloid
conformations that correspond to the same sequence locations.
Applied to mutant prediction, AmyloidMutants identifies a global
conformational switch between A13 and its highly-toxic ‘lowa’ mutant
in agreement with a recent experimental model based on partial
chemical shift data. Predictions on mutant, yeast-toxic strains of
HET—s suggest similar alternate folds. When applied to HET—s and
a HET—s mutant with core asparagines replaced by glutamines (both
highly amyloidogenic chemically similar residues abundant in many
amyloids), AmyloidMutants surprisingly predicts a greatly reduced
capacity of the glutamine mutant to form amyloid. We confirm this
finding by conducting mutagenesis experiments.

1 INTRODUCTION

Under optimum conditions, proteins with diverse primary sequence
exhibit the ability to self-assemble into structurally varied, but highly

ordered ﬂ-sheet aggregates known as amyloid ﬁbrils (Dobson,
2003). Those forming amyloid under normal physiological
conditions can have profound effects on biological systems—
deleterious and beneﬁcial. On the one hand, amyloids play a role in
diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s, as well
as systemic amyloidosis. On the other, they serve vital functions
in normal biology such as in human peptide hormone storage,
bioﬁlm formation and a mechanism of protein-only inheritance by
yeast prions (Halfmann and Lindquist, 2010). However, the generic
nature of the fold, the observation that most proteins do not form
amyloid under normal conditions and the ability of many amyloids
to adopt multiple amyloid structures from the same peptide sequence
(structural strains) confounds stande sequence-speciﬁc models of
protein folding (Ostapchenko et (11., 2010). Moreover, sequences
with only a small likelihood of forming amyloid can remain so given
many mutations, or become abundantly amyloidogenic after only a
single point change (Lie et (11., 2004). Therefore, to better understand
the sequence/structure relationship of amyloid ﬁbrils, a meaningful
predictive model is required that describes the relationship between
a given sequence and its mutational neighborhood.

Countless experimental studies have been performed to probe the
molecular mechanism of these enigmatic structures. However, most
methods (developed primarily for globular proteins) are difﬁcult to
apply to amyloids due to their large size and insolubility. Techniques
such as solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (H/D-exchange) have brought
us the most information about ﬁbril structure, but only through
exhaustive work and complex experimental design (Luca et (11.,
2007; Liihrs et (11., 2005; Mukrasch et (11., 2009; Vilar et (11.,
2007; Wasmer et (11., 2008). The high cost of such studies has
prevented the kinds of large-scale investigations that can reveal
the underlying sequence/structure relationships in functional and
pathogenic amyloid folds.

Seminal work has shown that computational prediction of
sequence amyloidogenicity can help guide and speed investigations
of amyloid structure (Alberti et (11., 2009; Bryan et (11., 2009;
Femandez-Escamilla et (11., 2004; Tartaglia and Vendruscolo
et (11., 2008; Trovato et (11., 2007). These advances enabled new
possibilities for genome-wide studies, such as the discovery of
19 new ﬁinctioning amyloid proteins in yeast (Alberti et (11.,
2009). More specialized tools (Maurer-Stroh et (11., 2010; Thompson
et (11., 2006) have been ﬁirther developed that detail the structure

Modeling the mutational landscape of amyloids

 

of one particular amyloid ﬁbril conformation: ‘steric zippers’, a
repeated, dry B-strand/B-strand packing consisting of a few amino
acids (Sawaya et (11., 2007). However, other more elaborate amyloid
conformations such as B-solenoids (Wasmer et (11., 2008) cannot be
considered by these specialized methods. Unfortunately, while these
techniques can generate high-resolution structural predictions, they
can only predict structural detail for regions of ~6 to 10 residues
at a time due to the assumption of a steric zipper conformation.
While such short segments may act as hot spots for amyloid
formation, a full-peptide structure prediction cannot be made, which
encompasses the size of amyloid sequences found in nature. In the
opposite vein, earlier tools are able to predict the amyloidogenicity
of sequences of any length, and agnostic to a particular molecular
conformation, but unfortunately their structural prediction accuracy
can suffer, achieving at best ~40% sensitivity on per-residue
B-sheet location assignment and can exhibit insensitivity to sequence
mutation (Morel et (11., 2006). Moreover, these tools do not predict
complete super-secondary structures, and do not capture the ﬁner
details of B-sheet residue/residue interactions that allow one amyloid
conformation to be distinguished from another.

In this article, we develop an algorithm, AmyloidMutants,
which predicts amyloid ﬁbril structural conformations, and the
sequence mutations that stabilize, reconﬁgure and de-stabilize
each ﬁbril conformation. Like earlier tools, our approach handles
ﬁill-length amyloid sequences, but greatly improves predictive
accuracy by calculating Boltzmann-distributed energetics over
only those B-strand arrangements likely to be found in amyloid
ﬁbrils. A statistical mechanical ensemble is constructed that scores
a complete family of millions of conformational states and
sequence polymorphisms (a ‘mutational landscape’). A comparison
of these sequence/structure states allows for the prediction of
likely conformations and the identiﬁcation of sequence determinants
of structural heterogeneity. The goal of our algorithm is thus to
efﬁciently calculate all these possible states, and produce accurate,
physically meaningful amyloid ﬁbril predictions.

AmyloidMutants is sensitive enough to distinguish dramatic
shifts from one amyloid conformation to another when as little
as a single point mutation is made; at the same time, it provides
highly accurate predictions of structure, strain conformations and
mutant amyloidogenicity. Indeed, in agreement with experimental
observations, our tool identiﬁes separate, incompatible amyloid
conformations that are preferentially induced by wild-type (WT)
AB and the AB Iowa mutant (Tycko et (11., 2009), as well as
similarly distinct structures resulting from wild-type and yeast-toxic
mutant strains of HET—s (Couthouis et (11., 2009). AmyloidMutants
also allows us to probe the amyloidogenic relationship between
chemically similar residues such as Asn and Gln, which revealed
a speciﬁc HET—s sequence sensitivity to Asn.

2 APPROACH

We present AmyloidMutants, a web-based tool for predicting
the structural and mutational landscapes of amyloid ﬁbrils using
an ensemble algorithm. In an ensemble predictor, each peptide
sequence is presumed to fold into a complete set of millions
(or billions) of unique structural states, with a single energetic
value calculated for each state according to its entire conformation
(McCaskill, 1990). From this quantiﬁed set of all possible structures,
clusters of low-energy states with similar conformations can be

extracted as predictions of likely real-world structures, with relative
probabilities of occurrence. A mutational ensemble predictor simply
increases the dimensionality of this set by including sequence
variation within each state. (Note, ‘ensemble’ predictors differ from
consensus predictors; the latter produces a single prediction based
on the consensus of multiple authors’ algorithms.)

The deﬁnition of an amyloid ﬁbril ‘state’ greatly impacts
the accuracy of an ensemble predictor: including atomic details
would result in an intractable computation, while high-level
representations that work in 1D sequence space can miss important
steric and energetic details. To capture critical 3D elements while
retaining efﬁciency, we choose to model super-secondary structural
information—each state contains a sequence and a unique set of
residue/residue B-strand backbone interaction pairs. But even so,
calculating the energy of all mathematically possible interactions
would introduce an exponential number of states as a ﬁinction of
sequence length.

We introduce ‘schemas’ as an algorithmic construct to solve this
by partitioning ﬁbrillar from non-ﬁbrillar conformations, enforcing
steric consistency and enabling energetic calculations over all
amyloid ﬁbril sequence/structure states. For efﬁciency and usability
purposes, putative amyloid ﬁbril states are separated into three
largely distinct topology families: schemas 73, A and S, which to our
knowledge, together subsume the variation found in most published
experimental and hypothetical amyloid ﬁbril structure models
(Fig. 1). These schemas also account for sequence variation through
a simple user speciﬁcation of the mutational possibilities that should
be explored: e. g. ‘all Val can mutate to A1(1, Leu, or Ile’ . For example,
schema 73 and A describes an abstract ‘B-solenoid’ encompassing
millions of structures with unique residue/residue interactions
and varying numbers of B-strands, B-rungs, B-sheet width, coil
location, residue orientation and residue packing neighbors (for
example, HET—s A predictions in Section 4 calculate the energy
of ~4 billions states). Speciﬁc 2-, 3- and 4-sheet B-helix-like
structures are accounted for by the introduction of ‘kinks’ (Fig. 2).
Similarly, schema 8 represents millions of possible full-length

Conceptually, each schema ‘shape’ can be thought to resemble the
‘architecture’ level of CATH (Pearl et (11., 2003) protein structure
classiﬁcation: for example, schema 73 resembles the ‘2-solenoid’
and ‘3-solenoid’ classiﬁcations that make up 2 out of the 20
‘mainly-beta’ architectures in all proteins in CATH. We note
that schemas should not be conﬁised with threading templates
used in other protein and amyloid modeling tools (Thompson
et (11., 2006): threading tools ﬁx a peptide backbone to a speciﬁc
atomistic position and computationally score the effects of residue-
speciﬁc side chains, whereas schemas cover a wide range of
amyloid conformation and peptide backbone arrangements in
3D space. Further, AmyloidMutants does not predict kinetics of
amyloid formation, but simply the set of possible conformations
at steady-state encompassing arbitrary environment conditions.
No restrictions are placed on the location or size of structural
elements with the exception of individual B-strand lengths, which is
ﬁxed to a range of 6—12 residues for efﬁciency purposes, and can
vary within a single structure (except when noted in Section 1 of
Supplementary Material).

3 METHODS

3.1 Calculating amyloid ensembles

AmyloidMutants models the structural effects of sequence variation by
conceptually scoring all possible amyloid ﬁbril conformations that any
sequence (and its mutants) can attain. Using a statistical mechanical
approach. all structures are members of a canonical ensemble. with each
state’s energetic value assigned according to a Boltzmann distribution. Such
an ensemble predictor differs fundamentally from existing techniques that
perform an algorithmic search for an individual. lowest energy structure
state. However. computing the score of all possible states in atomistic detail is
considered computationally intractable (Istrail. 2000). so our approach uses a
philosophy of domain restriction (Via schemas) to efﬁciently predict accurate.
physically meaningful amyloid structures at the level of super-secondary
structure. The utility of such an approach has been demonstrated in RNA
(McCaskill. 1990; Waldispiihl et al.. 2008b); however. protein structures are
too complex to tractably apply their same methods.

At the core of our framework lies the ability to compute the
Boltzmann partition function (Z) for given protein sequences. This
thermodynamic normalization constant encodes the statistical variation
of a system in equilibrium. and is used to identify the signiﬁcance
of structures within an ensemble. Z is deﬁned by the sum: Vs, Z:
ZSeTE-i/RT. given temperature T. the physical constant R and a
Boltzmann-distributed energy score E for every conformation s within the
ensemble. AmyloidMutants extends the notion of a structural ensembles
to analyze protein sequence/structure ensembles. redeﬁning the partition

function Z as: Va), Vs. ZzzmzxeTE-i/RT, given sequences a) and
structures s. This encodes statistical variations in protein structure as
well as sequence. distributed according to the energetic likelihood of that
sequence’s conformations. With this. one can identify energetically favorable
sequence/structure assignments and quantitatively measure the energetic
difference of between states.

AmyloidMutants is implemented using C++. with modular templates
describing the recursively enumerable sequence and structure space. An
analysis is performed on the sequence input to optimize the search
across sequence/structure states. and a dynamic programming procedure
is constructed that traverses and scores all possible states. tabulating these
values. From this. Z can be calculated Via a simple traversal.

3.2 Amyloid schema deﬁnition

Schemas are generative rules restricting the exponential set of peptide
conformations to only those that form amyloid ﬁbrils. These are deﬁned in
two parts. a recursive encoding of structure space and a protocol giving a list
of all allowed sequence mutations. To model a theoretically endless ﬁbril we
employ a concept of symmetry. representing an amyloid as the conformation
of single peptide combined with two sets of inter-peptide ﬁ-sheet interactions
up and down the axis. We detail here speciﬁc characteristics used to deﬁne
a schema. beyond the qualitative description in Figure 1.

Structure space is deﬁned as putative geometric arrangement of ﬁ-sheets at
the resolution of (i) intrapeptide hydrogen bonds along the ﬁbril axis; (ii) (3-
sheet/ﬁ-sheet packing perpendicular to the axis (e. g. steric-zipper packings.
etc.); and (iii) peptide/peptide symmetry describing interpeptide hydrogen
bonds. Residue side chain orientations are also included in the model to
indicate inward (hydrophobically packed) and outward (solvent exposed)
states. Thus. a single structure can tell you whether a residue is in a (3-
sheet or coil. its orientation. which other residue(s) it forms a hydrogen
bonding pair with and which topologically speciﬁc ﬁ-sheet its found in.
indicating other ﬁ-sheets it may pack against. Finally. (S-strand ‘kinks’ model
two successive (S-strand residues that have the same side-chain orientation
(Fig. 2). Modeling kinks allows more precise energetic parameters when
two sequentially adjacent (S-strands form a sharp turn (as in many B-helices).
since these junctions differ from coil-separated (S-strands.

Sequence space is deﬁned by a set of allowed mutations off a base
sequence. per sequence position. per residue. For example. ‘position index
10 can either be Ala. Leu. or Val.’ input Via programmable macros. This
level of speciﬁcation is required to avoid an exponential computation. as
there are 20N residue permutations in a sequence of length N. At runtime.
an analysis is performed to determine the minimum dynamic programming
table dimension required to ﬁt each possible mutation. Presently. deletion
and insertion mutations are not supported due to limitations of the energy
models.

Although not used for results in this article. schemas can be further reﬁned
to incorporate speciﬁc point knowledge into the ensemble. enabling a more
proﬁtable. iterative back-and-forth between predictions and experimentation.
These reﬁnements include: (i) limiting (S-strand or coil length; (ii) enabling
or disabling ﬁ-sheet ‘kinks’; (iii) requiring a minimum/maximum total-
ﬁbril ﬁ-sheet concentration; (iv) enabling or disabling ﬁbril twist; (V)
permitting N- and C-terminal coil asymmetries; and (Vi) allowing user-
deﬁned residue/residue hydrogen bond contacts to be ﬁxed.

3.3 Energy model for amyloid-like interaction

AmyloidMutants uses a potential energy scoring function derived from
observing the frequency of speciﬁc residue/residue interactions in (non-
sequence-homologous) PDB (Berman et al.. 2000) protein structures. Many
protein and RNA modeling tools (Bradley et al.. 2001; Trovato et al.. 2007;
Waldispiihl et al.. 2008a; Zuker and Stiegler. 1981) have successfully used
such statistical potentials because of two main advantages: (i) residue/residue
interactions (or base pairs in RNA) can efﬁciently capture the important.
energetically stabilizing features of 3D structure without the need of

molecular detail. and (ii) constructing an energetic scoring function from
known PDB structures does not require a priori expert information. so as
new structures are solved. typically accuracy increases. Note. such statistical
potentials do not incorporate environmental conditions such as pH.

Traditional pairwise contact models calculate the frequency with which
residues pair within a (S-sheet (Bradley et al.. 2001; Waldispiihl et al..
2006). AmyloidMutants extends this by conditioning each probability by the
local 3D environment. including amphipathicity and solvent accessibility.
ﬁ-strand edge proximity. residue-stacking ladders. ﬁ-sheet edges and ﬁ-sheet
twist [e.g. p(i|j,env)]. discretizing higher resolution information important
to amyloid structure. Accordingly. each residue position in every possible
ensemble state has an associated environment that allows the search
procedure to apply the correct energy. For example. residues/residue pairs
facing toward the center of the (S-solenoid in schemas ’P and A would be
considered solvent inaccessible. These ﬁ-sheet potentials are combined and
scaled with potentials for consecutive coil residues (p(i,j)). as well as an
optional hydropathic packing score describing the propensity for ﬁ-sheet
faces to pack against one another (Kyte and Doolittle. 1982). There is no
explicit cost for the act of mutation. merely an energetic change due to a new
sequence (Section 3 of Supplementary Material). The algorithm supports
additional types of potentials. such as position-speciﬁc scoring matrices.
stacked residue-pairs (Waldispiihl et al.. 2008a). and chemical propensities
(Miyazawa and J ernigan. 1985). although these are not used here.

Formally. a ﬁbril’s energy is decomposed into independent substructure
energy scores that recombine according to the schema topology. The energy
of each state s is deﬁned to be ES 2 —RTlog(pS) — RTlog(Z). and we make the
assumption that E can be linearly decomposed into 1' parts such that E =
Zi—RTlogQJ,(i)—RTlog(Z) (Clote and Backofen. 2000). The probability
ka thus represents the likelihood of observing a substructural state k. such
as the propensity for two residues to pair within a ﬁ-sheet. and log(Z) serves
as a statistical centering constant. Predicted states represent steady-state
conditions and do not reﬂect folding kinetics.

3.4 Sampling and stochastic contact maps

The principal output of AmyloidMutants is a sampled set of unique
sequence/structure states (a list of sequences and their corresponding
conformations) that is statistically representative of the full ensemble. Prior
work has demonstrated the higher predictive accuracy of ensemble sampling
over minimum energy structures (Waldispiihl et al.. 2008a). To achieve
this. a sampling procedure performs an energetically weighted stochastic
backtrack over subsequence/substructure scores generated when computing
Z. Populations of similar structures are separated Via PAM clustering.
taking as input the number of clusters. and using a distance metric that
optionally combines sequence. secondary structure. energy score. hydrogen
bond registration. coil location and (S-strand overlap. A mediod is selected
to represent each cluster. User-deﬁnable distance metric changes allow for
independent analysis of speciﬁc structural or sequential features.

Another form of output. the stochastic contact map. describes the
Boltzmann-weighted likelihood pigj that any two residues 1' and j will form a13-
sheet hydrogen bond. given all the conformations in the ensemble. To remove
schema bias. the null hypothesis probability of any residue 1' and j forming
a bond is subtracted from piJ (Section 3 of Supplementary Material). This
allows AmyloidMutants to identify small (S-strand interaction motifs within
the ensemble that may be hard to discern from full conformation sampling.
Furthermore. contact maps scores can be used to predict structural properties
such as X-ray crystallography B-Values (Waldispiihl et al.. 2008a).

Even in the absence of mutation predictions, AmyloidMutants offers
the the highest structure prediction accuracy to date. We demonstrate

this by comparing predictions against experimental data for ﬁve
of the best studied WT amyloid proteins: AB (Liihrs et (11., 2005;
Petkova et (11., 2003) (39-42aa), HET—s (Wasmer et (11., 2008)
(73aa), amylin (Kajava et (11., 2005; Luca et (11., 2007) (37aa),
a-synuclein (Heise et (11., 2005; Vilar et (11., 2007) (140aa) and
tau (Mukrasch et (11., 2009; von Bergan et (11., 2000) (htau40,
441aa). This set covers pathogenic and functional amyloids found
in nature for which there are a number of published structural
experiments, including NMR secondary structure chemical shift
and H/D exchange data. The ability to accurately predict the
structure of such peptides could potentially help elucidate how
native amyloid-related processes (such as bioﬁlm formation) impact
cellular function, and allow for targeted experimentation.

For these ﬁve proteins, AmyloidMutants correctly identiﬁes
experimentally observed B-sheet regions in 21 of 22 cases
(Fig. 4, Table 1)—a per-residue secondary-structure classiﬁcation
sensitivity/speciﬁcity of 82%/95% and an average SOV score
of 82 (Zelma et (11., 1999). Using the same comparison, the
best of the available full-length amyloid prediction tools (Bryan
et (11., 2009; Femandez-Escamilla et (11., 2004; Maurer-Stroh et (11.,
2010; Tartaglia and Vendruscolo et (11., 2008; Trovato et (11.,
2007) produced a classiﬁcation sensitivity/speciﬁcity of 42%/90%
(Zyggregator) (Fig. 3). Per-residue B-sheet classiﬁcation is used
for this comparison since it can be inferred as a common output
of all tools; however, AmyloidMutants can provide more rich
predictions including super-secondary residue/residue interactions.
Therefore, a detailed analysis of each protein’s predictions is given to
demonstrate these added beneﬁts, along with a demonstration of how
ensemble predictions can help identify alternate ﬁbril conformations
in agreement with published experimental data.

AmyloidMutants was run on each sequence for all three schemas
79, A and S, with the schema that agreed best presented.
An ensemble was calculated, and conformations were sampled
and clustered, with the mediod structures reported (Section 1
of Supplementary Material). Although rough computational tests
can be applied to evaluate the schema ﬁtness (Section 3 of
Supplementary Material), in a typical real-world scenario (and what
has been applied thus far), an uncharacterized amyloid sequence
is predicted using all schemas, and results are compared against
the body of existing experimental data or used to guide further
disarnbiguating experimentation.

Note, although atomic-resolution steric zipper structures have
been solved for many short (~4 to 10aa) synthetic peptides (Maurer—
Stroh et (11. , 2010; Sawaya et (11., 2007), AmyloidMutants predictions
on such short peptides are trivial. Schemas can predict the position
and arrangement of steric zipper sites throughout a full-length
peptide, but are not designed to distinguish side-chain rotamers (and
are unrelated to steric zipper classes).

TANGO and PASTA tools most closely match our tool’s ability to predict
full-length per-residue amyloidogenicity. whereas Waltz aims to predict short
hots pots that could speciﬁcally adopt a steric zipper.

Amyloid Beta (AB): an ensemble analysis of AB is particularly
poignant as it has many known isoforms (A0140, A0142,
A61_40/D23N, A61_40/EZZQ, etc.) and subsequences (19151642,
ABHQS, etc.) that have been reported to form a diverse range of
ﬁbril structures, including strain polymorphisms within the same
sequence (Petkova et (11., 2005). Our tool predicts the experimentally
observed structure of two possible AB conformations, recapitulating
two distinct experimental models of the peptide based on NMR,
H/D-exchange and mutational analysis (Liihrs et (11., 2005; Petkova
et (11., 2003). After clustering, the highest likelihood mediod structure
nearly identically matches the latter of these two models (Liihrs
et (11., 2005) (Fig. 4a), including B-strand positions, interior/exterior
side chain orientation and the inter peptide parallel hydrogen
bonding registration. This cluster accounts for 55% of the ensemble.
Interestingly, the second highest likelihood mediod exhibits a clear
shift in one of the B-strand regions and aligns very closely with
the earlier NMR model (Petkova et (11., 2003). This cluster is more
heterogeneous, including many other structural arrangements, and
accounts for 39% of the ensemble. Furthermore, recent experimental
studies of AB conformational variation have shown that ﬁbrils
formed under quiescence and agitation differ, for instance, in the
assignment of position 15 to B-strand (Petkova et (11., 2005). The
predicted clusters also make this rough distinction: the larger cluster
does not contain a B-strand at position 15, while the smaller does.
Moreover, brain-seeded ﬁbrils have exhibited spatial proximity

between residues F19/I31, whereas unseeded in vitro ﬁbrils do
not (Paravastu et (11., 2009). AmyloidMutants also predicts such a
divergence: in 16% of the ensemble, F19 and I31 are both oriented
toward the center of the ﬁbril, enabling proximal contact. Section 1
of Supplementary Material provides ﬁirther detail.

HET-s: the 73 amino acid Podospora (mserina HET—s prion is
the most complex amyloid whose atomic-level 3D structure has
been solved (Wasmer et (11., 2008), forming a well-ordered (3-
helix with two rungs per chain and four B-sheets that are more
appropriately modeled as two pairs of B-sheets separated by a
kink in the stande ‘in/out’ residue orientation. AmyloidMutants
strongly predicts two possible structures, the most likely of which
forms a two-rung B-solenoid that almost exactly mirrors the NMR
model, including hydrogen bond registration, side chain orientation
and kink location (Fig. 4b, accounting for 68% of the ensemble).
The lower likelihood conformation incorporates only a single rung,
matching one of the rungs in the NMR structure. This strong
predictive bias toward only two possible structures may relate to the
observed conformational homogeneity of HET—s ﬁbrils. Achieving
such high accuracy on this difﬁcult B-structural topology supports
our tool’s use for mutational analysis across broadly different
ﬁbril types. Furthermore, recent experimental studies have partially
characterized a distant homologue to Ranserina HET—s found in
Fusarium graminearum (Wasmer et (11., 2010). Although FgHET—s
exhibits only 38% sequence similarity, solid-state NMR and H/D-
exchange data suggest an extremely similar B-solenoidal structure
as in PaHET—s. Despite the large difference in sequence, predictions
very well match the FgHET—s structural model, aligning B-strand
location, hydrogen-bond registration, side-chain orientation and
kink location (Supplemantary Fig. S1).

Amylin: AmyloidMutants predictions for human amylin indicate
two viable conformations: a 2-sheet B-solenoid forms 80% of
the ensemble and agrees closely with NMR and microscopy
results (Luca et (11., 2007) (Fig. 4c); and a much less likely three-
sheet serpentine model that aligns almost perfectly with an older
model of amylin structure (Kajava et (11., 2005). Interestingly, the
experimental model identiﬁes an interprotoﬁbril interaction between
Phe23 and Tyr37—something beyond the scope of our schema.
However, our B-solenoid predictions clearly separate into two
distinct populations, one incorporating Phe23 into a B-sheet and
one that does not. This highlights the importance of an ensemble
analysis: the existence of high-likelihood alternate structures may
draw attention to an overlooked structural interaction.

a-Synuclein: ﬁve B-sheet regions in a-synuclein have been
identiﬁed through substantial experimental effort (Heise et (11.,
2005; Vilar et (11., 2007). AmyloidMutants ensemble predictions
agree extremely well with these results, aligning all ﬁve B-sheet
regions, and identifying other important experimental observations
such as a B-sheet break around residues 67—68 (Fig. 4d). One
of the predicted clusters does produce a false positive, however,
identifying amphipathic B-strands in the N-terminal region, a
disordered segment thought to favor a lipid-binding amphipathic
ot-helical structure (Section 1 of Supplementary Material).

Tau ( 1' )2 NMR studies have shown this 441 amino acid long amyloid
to form a mixture of up to eight transient B-sheet regions (Mukrasch
et (11., 2009), with two speciﬁc B-strands necessary for ﬁbril

assembly (von Bergan et a1., 2000) (positions 306—311 and 275—
280). Predicted B-sheets align very closely with these observed
regions in seven of eight cases. Moreover, AmyloidMutants
identiﬁes the two hexapeptides experimentally observed necessary
for assembly by predicting their B-strand interactions as having
the strongest score (Section 1 of Supplementary Material). Four
false positive regions are predicted to contain B-strands, although
similar to ot-synuclein, two overlap with observed ot-helices which
the schema does not incorporate and may contain sequences with
high B-sheet propensity. Overall, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of
our predictions over such a long sequence considerably advance the
state of the art (Fig. 3).

4.2 Prediction of a conformational switch in AB and
HET-s mutants

AmyloidMutants is uniquely capable of identifying change in
amyloid ﬁbril conformation from one amyloid B-sheet topology
to another. This distinction from tools that predict general
amyloidogenicity is important as a structural change from one
amyloid form to another can have a dramatic impact on
oligomerization and nucleation rates (Kim and Hecht, 2008), disease
infectivity (Tycko et a1., 2009), and prion propagation (Alberti et a1.,
2009). We have used this ability to identify potential alternate,
distinct amyloid ﬁbril conformations that arise in the AB familial
‘Iowa’ mutation (Tycko et a1., 2009) and yeast-toxic mutants of
HET—s (Berthelot et a1., 2009; Couthouis et a1., 2009) (details and
comment provided in Sections 2 and 3 of Supplementary Material).
Described below are these AmyloidMutants results, highlighting
consistencies with published experimental data.

AB Iowa mutant: recent studies (Tycko et a1., 2009) suggest that
A01_40/D23N may form an antiparallel B-strand ﬁbril conformation
that differs completely from known experimental models (Liihrs
et al., 2005; Petkova et a1., 2003). This work suggests an antiparallel

B-sheet around residues 16—22 (with unknown length), with an
interB-strand interface such that L17 bonds to A21 [designated
‘17+k<—>21-k’ registry (Tycko et a1., 2009)]. Similarly, a second
antiparallel B-sheet likely exists around positions 30—36, with
L34 and F19 in close contact. Interestingly, this speciﬁc A131 _40
registry has only previously been seen in the peptide fragment
A016_22, which lacks D23 (Tycko and Ishii, 2003), while the
antiparallel forming fragment A011_25 shows inverted ‘17+k<—>22-k’
and ‘17+k<—>20-k’ registries (Petkova et a1., 2004) (Table 2).

To analyze this point mutant, we predicted ensembles for A131 _40
and A01_40/D23N using schema A (which allows antiparallel
inter-peptide interactions). Detailed in Table 2, AmyloidMutants’
A01_40/D23N predictions strongly preferred a ‘17+k<—>21-k’ registry
conformation, with predicted contacts between L34/F 19, and very
little variation within the ensemble. This arrangement agrees
with observed A1316_22 structures. Conversely, predictions for
WT A0140 are quite heterogeneous, although with the largest
cluster of structures forming ‘17+k<—>22-k’ registry, in agreement
with observed A011_25 structure. More strikingly, the ‘17+k<—>21-
k’ registry conformation favored by A01_40/D23N appears to be
strongly disfavored by A131 _40 (and A01_40/D23N appears to disfavor
‘17+k<—>22-k’ registry). These predictions and the divergence in
ensemble makeup between A0140 and A01_40/D23N strongly
supports the idea that the D23N mutation results in a singular
energetically favorable conformational rearrangement from parallel
B-sheets (in WT) to antiparallel B-sheets (in the D23N mutation). At
the residue level, the adoption of this ‘17+k<—>21-k’ conformation
may be driven by both the alignment of oppositely charged K16 and
E22 and the stacking arrangement of Q15 and N23 (Table 2).

HET-s yeast-toxic mutants: our technique is able to further
predict putative conformational rearrangements between a set of
HET—s mutants shown to exhibit toxicity in yeast. In recent
studies (Berthelot et a1., 2009; Couthouis et a1., 2009), structural

Predictions show a signiﬁcant change in the conformational landscapes of AB H10 and
ABHm/DBN in agreement with published experimental evidence (Tycko et al., 2009)
of an antiparallel, ‘17+k<—>21-k’ registry B-sheet in ABHWDBN (boldface). Sampled
ensemble structures were Classiﬁed into one of three categories of B-sheet registry, with
the percent makeup of each provided. B-sheet registry is Classiﬁed by residue/residue

differences were found in a toxic HET—s mutant (named m8) and
compared against four other non-toxic mutants (m3, m4, m9, ml 1)
and WT. Notably, m8 exhibits a marked change from WT in
secondary structure makeup, showing a shift of approximately half
of the B-strand structure from parallel to antiparallel interactions.
AmyloidMutants can distinguish these phenotypically different
mutants by inspecting predicted results using different schemas and
comparing the relative structural heterogeneity of the ensembles. We
premise that sequence mutants which signiﬁcantly alter the predicted
ensemble makeup (away from WT) are more likely to exhibit
a different high-level conformational arrangement, and that high-
likelihood conformations within an ensemble offer good predictive
ﬁts. Conversely, predictions that do not particularly favor any single
conformation may suggest a poor ﬁt. Table 3 reports ensemble
predictions for the given six mutants, comparing schemas 73 and
A. Across all mutants, schema 73 predict clusters of 2-rung and l-
rung structures, while schema A predicts three clusters: two forms
of 2-rung solenoids and one with l-rung (Supplementary Fig. Sll).
The difference between schemas 73 2-rung and A 2-rung
correlates with the shift in secondary structure makeup observed —
79 2-rung contains only parallel B-sheet structures while A 2-rung
can contain an equal amount of parallel and antiparallel B-sheet
structure. Under schema 73, we see that WT, m4, and m8 form
better 2-rung solenoids than a l-rung solenoid, whereas with m3,
m9, and mll, the opposite is true or no preference is apparent. This
discrimination of mutants based on the structural landscape mirrors
phenotypic variation seen by GFP-tagged aggregates (Couthouis
et a1., 2009) (independent of predictive accuracy). Under schema A,
we see similarities between the structural distribution of WT, m4,
m3, m9, and ml 1; however, the toxic m8 mutant appears to strongly
prefer only one of the 2-rung conformations. Such a dramatic shift
in the predicted ensemble could suggest that the m8 mutant is
energetically inclined to form the structure in cluster A 2-rung-A.

4.3 Identiﬁcation of preferential Asn amyloidogenicity
over Gln in HET-s

Beyond its ability to discriminate amyloid ﬁbril structure states,
AmyloidMutants accurately models more coarse amyloidogenicity

 

Ensemble conformational landscape predictions of six HET—s variants produced two
general structure Classiﬁcations for schema ’P and three general Classiﬁcations for
schema A (rows, relative percent makeup given). While other mutants do not favor one
particular schema A structure, the yeast-toxic mutant m8 exhibits a strong energetic
bias for A 2-rung-A. The differences in structure bias shown may suggest an increased
likelihood that m8 adopts an antiparallel conformation (boldface). Observed phenotypic
differences between mutants are summarized at the bottom (Couthouis et al., 2009).

properties, allowing us to study a more fundamental question:
the role chemically similar residues Asn and Gln play in ﬁbril
structure. Given the high propensity of Q/N-rich peptides to form
amyloid (Chiti and Dobson, 2006), the amyloidogenic potential
of Asn and Gln has often been considered equal—however,
recent evidence suggests that N-rich proteins may have a slightly
higher tendency to form amyloid (Alberti et a1., 2009) [even
though Gln mutations can improve stability (Gromiha et a1.,
1999)]. We study this question by considering the effect of four
ladder-forming asparagine residues in Ranserina HET-s (positions
226, 243, 262 and 279) which are believed important for ﬁbril
stabilization (Wasmer et a1., 2008), and whose regions are conserved
in a Fgraminearum homolog. AmyloidMutants sequence/structure
landscapes were calculated permitting these four residues to mutate
to Gln (‘HET-s/4N—>Q’), and the likelihood and corresponding
energetic weight of each sequence within the ensemble was
compared. The WT HET-s sequence was much more energetically
favorable than HET-s/4N—>Q, comprising ~96% of the ensemble,
suggesting a greatly reduced ability of HET-s/4N—>Q to form ﬁbrils,
and a putatively higher amyloidogenic potential of Asn over Gln.
Stochastic contact map predictions further illustrate this difference
between sequences (Supplementary Fig. S9).

We tested these predictions experimentally, using puriﬁed
recombinant WT and 4N—>Q HET-s proteins (Section 4 of
Supplementary Material). Denatured proteins were diluted into a
physiological buffer and allowed to form amyloid. While the WT
protein readily did so, as detected by the retention of detergent-
insoluble aggregates on a non-binding membrane, the mutant protein
was recalcitrant to amyloid formation (Fig. 5).

4.4 Mutational landscapes predict experimental
amyloidogenicity

AmyloidMutants’ ability to accurately predict amyloidogenicity

is validated by comparing our results against a large number of

experimentally characterized amyloid mutants. This includes an

analysis of the 289-residue HET-s/HET—S natural homologs found

in Ranserina, a combination of three AB scanning mutagenesis

studies, and a set of 74 synthetic mutants of AB created by random
mutagenesis. The amyloidogenicity of each mutation is predicted
by computing a joint mutational landscape over WT and mutant
sequences, and quantifying which sequence more readily forms
amyloid according to its energetic weight within the ensemble.
For example, if WT sequence/structure states occupy 90% of the
ensemble, then any speciﬁed mutations are likely to result in a less
amyloidogenic peptide (Supplementary Text Section 3).

HET-s/HET-S: In Ranserina, the HET-s allele forms an amyloid
conformation in its prion form, while the HET-S allele does not,
despite differing by only three residues in the amyloid-forming 72-
residue C-terminus, and 13 overall (Coustou et a1., 1999). Predicting
the joint HET-s/HET—S mutational landscape, AmyloidMutants
found that ~72% of the ensemble favored HET-s, indicating that it
is more amyloidogenic than HET-S. Although N-terminal mutations
can induce a prion state in HET-S (Coustou et a1., 1999), our
predictions suggests a sequence bias in HET—s permitting a more
energetically favorable path for amyloid formation.

AB single-point proline mutagenesis: scanning mutagenesis studies
have been performed on A040 to detect the sequence position effect
of proline-, alanine- and cysteine-replacement on amyloid ﬁbril
formation, measured by WT/mutant AAG (Shivaprasad et a1., 2006;
Williams et a1., 2004, 2006). Although P, A and C-replacement AAG
values are difﬁcult to interpret independently [due to experimental
structural heterogeneity (Williams et a1., 2006)], they support the
broader conclusion that A1340 positions 18—21, 25—26 and 32—33
are particularly sensitive to P-replacement (Williams et a1., 2006).
AmyloidMutants’ predictions of the joint mutational landscape
for individual proline replacements identiﬁed positions l6—25 and
31—35 as particularly disruptive in agreement with these studies.
Supplementary Figure S12 plots this agreement along with similar
predictions by TANGO and Zyggregator, although a direct one-to-
one comparison between predictions and AAG values would be
inappropriate.

AB multiple-residue mutagenesis: AmyloidMutants predictions were
also performed on a set of 74 AB mutants (Kim and Hecht,
2006, 2008; Wurth et a1., 2002) whose relative aggregation levels
were observed by GFP ﬂuorescence relative to WT. AmyloidMutants
accurately identiﬁes which mutants form amyloid more (or less)
readily than WT in 81% of sequences (60 of 74, Supplementary

Fig. S8). AmyloidMutants’ performance on such a large set further
supports its general applicability.

5 DISCUSSION

AmyloidMutants provides the highest accuracy prediction to date
of the ﬁill ﬁbril structure of amyloid sequences, but its greater
value is its unique ability to discover which mutations effect a
change in amyloid structure(s), to predict what that structure is
and to assign meaningful energetic weights comparing mutant
conformations. This accuracy is due, in part, to the ability
to model coarse, higher dimension spatial interactions, beyond
simpler lD sequence motifs. This is an important distinction from
amyloidogenicity predictors that identify structurally homogeneous
peptide sequences (Maurer-Stroh et a1., 2010). While the latter can
be helpful during an initial screen (searching for amyloid steric
zippers in particular), AmyloidMutants can predict and provide
insight into the full-length structure (Fig. 3) and residue/residue
interactions of both B-solenoidal and serpentine steric zipper ﬁbrils
(Fig. l), putatively identifying interactions critical to function or
pathogenicity. Further, through the use of Boltzmann ensembles,
our model of sequence/structure space is the only amyloid modeling
tool that captures ﬁbril structure variation and B-contact structural
topology changes that may arise in in vivo.

The exploration of mutational landscapes is an important
step in understanding differences between amyloid topologies,
how mutational variants arise in the wild, and to elucidate
evolutionary relationships between related amyloid proteins. This
capability depends on AmyloidMutants’ novel thermodynamic
characterization of all points within a mutational landscape, and is
necessary for the discovery of non-additive ﬁinctional relationships
between sequences and conformational epistasis (Ortlund et a1.,
2007). Further, we note that our tool provides additional features
for experimentalists (not used in this article) that allows extra-
sequential experimental data to be incorporated into the predictor
(Supplementary Text Section l)—as much or as little a priori
knowledge as desired, enabling a new tactic for iterative tool re-use.

At face value, the ability of most proteins to form a
characteristic cross-B-sheet amyloid structure in vitro (Dobson,
2003) seems at odds with the relatively small number of
amyloid-forming proteins that have been identiﬁed in vivo,
and the apparently high sequence dependence some amyloids
show when compared against sequence homologs. Moreover, the
existence of both beneﬁcial ﬁinctional amyloid sequences, and
putatively pathogenic ‘misfolded’ amyloid proteins suggests a
more complicated sequence/structure relationship than is found in
standard protein folding models. The power to accurately predict
amyloid structure from sequence, and to fully characterize the
amyloidogenicity of an entire mutational landscape provides insight
into this problem by identifying recurring sequence motifs, coarse
3D residue arrangements and putative mutational pathways linking
the sequences of known amyloid structures. The immediate impact
of this could improve our ability to identify amyloid structures from
genomic data alone, to better understand familial mutations that
intensify pathogenesis in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, to predict
the interaction strength of ﬁbril regions that may be involved in
nucleation and to enable targeted peptide design to alter ﬁbril
structure or inhibit ﬁbril formation.

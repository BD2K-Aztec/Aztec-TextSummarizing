Abstract

Motivation: RNA sequence design is studied at least as long as the classical folding problem.
Although forthe latter the functional fold of an RNA molecule is to be found, inverse folding tries to
identify RNA sequences that fold into a function—specific target structure. In combination with RNA—
based biotechnology and synthetic biology, reliable RNA sequence design becomes a crucial step

to generate novel biochemical components.

Results: In this article, the computational tool antaRNA is presented. It is capable of compiling RNA
sequences for a given structure that comply in addition with an adjustable full range objective GC—
content distribution, specific sequence constraints and additional fuzzy structure constraints.
antaRNA applies ant colony optimization meta—heuristics and its superior performance is shown on

a biological datasets.

1 Introduction

Engineered RNA molecules are of growing importance with applica-
tions ranging from biotechnology to medicine and synthetic biology.
In biotechnology, several applications use engineered RNAs as scaf-
folds to optimize reactions or to deliver drugs. For example, RNA
aptamers can serve as protein-docking sites within scaffolds to
organize intracellular reactions (Delebecque et (11., 2011, 2012). Or
the bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor can be used to gen-
erate RNA nanoparticles for delivering therapeutic compounds
(Guo, 2010). However, biotechnology applications are not restricted
to scaffold design, but often involve intriguing RNA-based path-
ways. For instance, Penchovsky and Breaker (2005) computationally
designed ribozymes to sense oligonucleotides. Last but not least, the
application of the CRISPR/cas9 system for genetic engineering is
emerging and complementing the well established RNAi technology.
This requires the design of specific RNA-molecules, see the review
of Terns and Terns (2014).

Another important and growing area is RNA synthetic biology,
as reviewed in (Benenson, 2012; Isaacs et (11., 2006). Design ex-
amples include RNA-based regulators of translation (Mutalik et (11.,
2012), a general, RNA-based framework for microbial engineering
on the level of DNA, protein or mRNA (Qi and Arkin, 2014),
sRNA-based cellular circuits (Rodrigo et (11., 2012), the improve-
ment of functional sRNAs by scaffold engineering (Sakai et (11.,
2014) or the (16 1101/0 design of synthetic, transcriptional ribos-
witches (Wachsmuth et (11., 2013).

Many of these approaches use rational design, based on a sec-
ondary structure model of the targeted RNA molecule, and an
increasing number of applications use computational methods for
filtering the initial design. In principle, this is an instance of the in-
verse folding problem, which consists of finding a sequence that fits
some secondary structure constraints. RNAim/erse (Hofacker et (11.,
1994) pursues seed sequence generation with a subsequent optimiza-
tion based on local search. The objective function is either to

maximize the similarity of the minimum free energy (MFE) structure
to the target, or to maximize the probability of the target structure
in the ensemble. Several other programs follow the idea of
RNAinUerse and try to provide better strategies for either finding
seed sequences or the local refinement step. For instance, in
InFoRNA (Busch and Backofen, 2006, 2007) the seeding was im—
proved by generating a sequence that is maximally stable for the tar—
get structure and thus has high probability to fold into that
structure. RNA-SSD (Andronescu et al., 2004) extends this by using
stochastic local search. In more recent approaches, new strategies
have been used in order to find sequence solutions: N UPACK
(Zadeh et al., 2011) is using efficient ensemble defect optimization;
RNAfbinU (Weinbrand et al., 2013) employs simulated annealing
for a fragment—based design; fRNAkenstein (Lyngso et al., 2012)
applies a genetic algorithm approach. Similarly, the approach by
Dromi et al. (2008), MODENA (Taneda, 2011) and ERD (Ali
et al., 2014) also apply evolution inspired principles to solve the in—
verse folding problem.

There are two necessary conditions an up—to—date inverse folding
tool must fulfill. First, the tool must be able to handle sequence con—
straints, in order to capture specific elements like a ligand binding
pocket in riboswitches or RNA aptamers binding a specific protein.
This is provided by most methods available. But second, the tool
has to provide a sequence with a defined guanine—cytosine
(GC)—content since the GC—content has drastic influence on the func—
tion of the designed molecule. For example, it is known that
CRISPR/cas9 elements with too low or too high GC—content do not
function optimally (Wang et al., 2014). Another example is given in
(Isaacs et al., 2004, 2006), where the authors engineered an RNA—
based regulatory activator system for bacterial gene expression.
They report that altering the GC—content and further increasing the
stability of the designed element did result in a 19—fold activation. In
contrast to this biological requirements, most of the first generation
tools have an intrinsic GC—bias (Reinharz et al., 2013) that cannot
be compensated by GC-filtering (see Supplementary Material).
Recently, programs have been developed, which allow to declare a
target GC—value or to constrain the GC—range for solution sequences.
So far, the only known tools providing this functionality are RNA-
SSD (Andronescu et al., 2004), IncaRNAtion (Reinharz et al., 2013),
which is a seed sequence generator for RNAinUerse, and RNAiFola'
(Garcia—Martin et al., 2013), a constraint programming approach.

Here we introduce antaRNA, which uses the ant colony
optimization (ACO) meta heuristic to solve the inverse folding prob—
lem of RNA to produce sequences with controlled target GC—
composition. Furthermore, sequence constraints are incorporated.
Accessorily, the introduction and application of implicit structure
constraints allows a design principle that enables the declaration of
RNA structure in a ‘fuzzy’ mode.

Sequences designed by antaRNA show high agreement of their
MFE—structures with the targeted structures independently of the
additional objective GC—content constraints.

2 Methods

antaRNA is based on the ACO heuristic, which was already success—
fully applied to solve a broad collection of classical optimization
problems, such as routing (Gambardella and Dorigo, 2000), sched—
uling (Socha et al., 2002), assignment (Merkle and Middendorf,
2003), subset partitioning/clustering (Blum and Blesa, 2005), con—
straint satisfaction (Solnon, 2000), classification rules (Parpinelli
et al., 2002) and Bayesian networks (de Campos et al., 2002). Also

directly biologically motivated problems such as protein structure
folding (Shmygelska and Hoos, 2005) and docking simulations
(Korb et al., 2006) as well as RNA secondary structure prediction
methods (McMillan, 2006 ) have been investigated with ACO.

Generally, ACO is a self—adjusting local search strategy, which
automatically adapts to the specific problem instance optimized.
Because RNA structure formation is very sensitive to sequence
changes, ACO should be able to learn the importance of local se—
quence features, which is an essential aspect when solving the RNA
inverse folding problem.

Thus in the following, we present the adaptation of AC0 to the
RNA inverse folding problem and describe the necessary basic RNA
notations to subsequently describe the algorithm. The algorithm is
depicted on a conceptual level. Please consult the supplement mater—
ial for more detailed formal definitions.

2.1 Ant colony behavior
Ants, while foraging for food or exploring new terrain, use phero—
mones to indicate the quality of a certain path on their return. They
apply a quality—dependent amount of pheromone to the just exam—
ined path (Pasteels et al., 1987), while the quantity is defined by
many (here abstracted) factors according to the situation: Does the
path yield food? Is the amount of food large/small? What is the qual—
ity of the food? Other ants sense the pheromone on a path and are
influenced in their decision whether to follow the same path or to
continue exploring new paths (Goss et al., 1989). The pheromone it—
self evaporates over time, such that, if no ant follows the indicated
path and renews its pheromone trail, the path becomes ‘silent’ or
‘unknown’ to the colony (Deneubourg et al., 1990).

The general principle of ACO (Dorigo and Stutzle, 2004; Dorigo
et al., 2006) simulates an ant colony and its foraging behavior on a
modeled terrain to solve optimization problems. Here, ACO is
incorporated and exerted to the problem of RNA inverse folding to
generate RNA sequences, which are optimized to fold into a tar—
geted structure under additional constraints. In the developed appli—
cation, the ants of a colony walk subsequently over the simulated
terrain and assemble and evaluate RNA solution sequences.
According to the quality of each solution, the solution generating
parts of the terrain are marked with pheromone, such that the infor—
mation of prior solutions contributes to the decisions of subsequent
ants. Each pheromone update also covers ‘environmental’ exposure
of the whole terrain, i.e. globally the pheromone information evap—
orates with a certain rate. Over time, one pheromone trail will dom—
inate the terrain and will indicate the best solution, which is in
accordance with the user defined constraints. The underlaying ACO
principle of antaRNA is depicted within Algorithm 1.

Each visited vertex v,“ emits its assigned nucleotide, i.e. the solution

2.4.3 Sequence evaluation

The actual evaluation of the assembled sequence is done via a com—
bination of different measures: a structural distance dstr, a GC—
content aberration distance dGc and a sequence distance dseq are
transformed into a score, with which the terrain is updated.

The structural distance dstr computation is based on the program
RNAfold of the ViennaRNA—package v2.1.3 (Lorenz et al., 2011).
In a first step RNAfold calculates the MFE—structure PM of the se—
quence 8.

Given PS“, next a solution dependent target structure PC is com—
posed, since (CStr allows for explicit and implicit structure con—
straints. Initially, PC contains all explicitly requested base pairs from
CS“. In the following, the handling of lonely base pairs, implicit
structure constraint and sequence constraint contributions are
discussed.

During the evaluation, explicitly requested lonely base pairs are
temporarily removed from PC, since they are usually energetically
unfavorable and thus counteract the MFE—based design principle.
For their ‘soft’ integration into the design, a distance penalty is
added for each lonely base pair that cannot be formed by the current
solution sequence 8. Lonely ‘2 base pair stacks’ are handled equiva—
lently for the same reason.

The ‘fuzzy’ implicit structure constraint allows for all base pairs
that are within one of its defined regions (see Fig. 1). Thus, all base
pairs of the current solution structure PM that are confined to such
blocks of implicit structure are temporarily added to the target struc-
ture PC.

Finally, in some cases, the sequence constraint (Cseq induces base
pairs under certain structural folding context. If both positions 8,
and 8; of a base pair of the current solution (i,/) 6 PM are con—
strained by (Cseq, this base pair is added to the target structure PC.

In a final step, the length—normalized base pair distance d,” be—
tween PS°I and the compiled target structure PC is determined.

The GC-aberration dGc between the objective and the actual
GC—content of 8 is determined by subtracting the actual from the
target GC value. Due to the discrete nature of sequence lengths, it is
often not possible to precisely reach the objective GC—content (CGC.
Thus, sequence length dependent correction terms are added to the
actual GC value for dGc computation.

The sequence constraint distance dseq encodes the violation of
the sequence constraint (Cseq given the current solution sequence 8.
It reflects the ratio of sequence positions that do not respect (Cseq.

The overall quality score Q of the sequence’s features is the
weighted sum of the inverted distance measures. Thus, lower dis—
tances result in higher quality estimates.

2.4.4 Pheromone update

Given the quality Q of a solution 8, the pheromone information of
the solution—associated edges in the terrain graph is increased by Q.
Hereby, only those edges are rewarded that correspond to positions
where the structure information is identical between the resulting so—
lution PM and the target structure PC. In order to limit the memor—
ization and influence of previous solutions, a global evaporation of
pheromone is applied. According to the evaporation rate p, the
pheromone information of all edges is reduced. The pheromone

information encodes the compliance of paths in the terrain with all
constraints. This way, the solution sequence assembly of subsequent
ants is tuned towards correct sequence designs, since the local deci—
sions are based on the combination of pheromone and heuristic in—
formation (see earlier).

2.4.5 Termination

Although the ants walk over the terrain, edges, which have been
involved in good solutions get promoted over those, which have not
contributed to good solutions. This solidifying behavior results in
convergence towards optimal or suboptimal quality in respect to the
given constraints. antaRNA uses three termination criteria to stop
the ACO: maximal number of generated solutions, a termination
potential and a reset potential.

The termination potential is initialized and increased every time
subsequent solutions show a structural distance of zero. As soon as
a termination threshold is exceeded, the algorithm is stopped and
the best solution according to Q is returned.

Another possibility to terminate is based on a maximal number
of internal terrain resets. The terrain and all initial values are reset,
if the reset potential exceeds the reset threshold. The reset potential
is increased, if the structural distance of a current solution is not
zero but the GC quality is within a margin of the momentarily best
solution, i.e. dGc S 1.5 * dE’fCStSﬂ“.

3 Datasets

The underlaying dataset of this study is an extract from the Rfam
database v11.0 (Burge et al., 2013). A training subset has been used
to evaluate and adjust antaRNA’s parameters. A distinct and larger
test set was used to benchmark and compare antaRNA with other
tools. We evaluated the behavior of the algorithms concerning dif—
ferent complexities of structure and sequence constraints and their
influence and impact on the solution sequences and their
characteristics.

For each selected Rfam family, structure and sequence informa—
tion of conserved positions within the respective Rfam family’s seed
alignment were extracted to define (CStr and (Cseq. We applied the fol—
lowing protocol to derive the dataset.

For each Rfam seed—alignment with at least 20 entries, the short—
est ungapped sequence was selected. Subsequently, the alignment’s
consensus structure was mapped to that sequence. The obtained
structure defines the explicit structure constraint (Cm. No implicit
structural constraints were derived. We further ensured a minimal
structural confinement, i.e. a family was discarded, if the fraction of
base pair forming positions within (CStr was below 20%.

For each position i within such a structure, a sequence constraint
(Cieq was set depending on a minimal conservation ratio MR. If a nu—
cleotide in the according column of the seed alignment shows a rela—
tive abundance larger than MR, the nucleotide is used as sequence
constraint. Otherwise, the position is unconstrained ((C,seq : N). A
family—specific MR threshold was used such that the fraction of
(Cseq—constrained sequence positions was in the range of 20—30%.
The GC—content of the (Cseq—constrained positions was not allowed
to exceed 15%, to ensure enough flexibility within the sequence
constraint to reach the targeted GC—values of the benchmark.

In total, this resulted in 83 derived targets from the Rfam data—
base. The lengths of the obtained constraints range from 34 to 274
nucleotides with varying constraint complexities. The training sub—
set contains constraints with lengths not longer than 200 nucleotides
and length differences of at least five nucleotides to the rest of all

sequences that exactly show the targeted GC—content, even when
additional sequence constraints are enforced. The MFE—structures of
the designed sequences respect the provided structural constraints
for almost all targets tested. This holds for a broad range of targeted
GC values with and without sequence constraints.

The program was optimized, compared and evaluated on various
sets of constraints derived from the Rfam database. The assessment
revealed the superior quality of antaRNA produced sequences over
IncaRNAtion and RNAiFold. The prime feature of a sequence and
its biological functionality is the structure. Thus, it should be the
central objective for sequence design tools. IncaRNAtion does not
achieve this objective and produced on average high structural dis—
tances in our experiments. Although it was tailored to enable spe—
cific GC—content optimization, it also shows poor performance in
fulfilling the targeted GC values. Only its high—sequence diversity
partially outperforms other compared methods. IncaRNAtion
applies a two stage—optimization approach that first produces GC—
optimized seed sequences that are subsequently optimized towards
the target structure by RNAinuerse. Thus, often the GC—unaware
RNAinuerse MFE—structure optimization counters the GC—
optimization.

In contrast, the sequences designed by RNAiFold and antaRNA
show both very good structural as well as GC compliance. Although
qualitative comparable on the level of constraint violation, the tools
show significant differences concerning reliability and sequence di—
versity. RNAiFold is not always producing sequence solutions
within the allowed runtime. This might be due to the used constraint
programming techniques and results in missing sequence designs for
many constraint sets. In contrast, antaRNA is based on ACO and
applies a parallel optimization of all constraints. Thus, it always re—
ports a solution sequence with no qualitative loss. Furthermore,
antaRNA produces more diverse sequence sets compared with
RNAiFold, which shows a trend to non—diverse subsequences.

Summarizing, the capability of antaRNA to reliably produce
highly diverse sequences for a given structure, coupled with the pre—
cise GC targeting, will help to explore the sequence space for RNA
design problems.

The introduced implicit structure constraints enable the user to
define parts of the structure in a very vague way. This can be of use
when the structural context of a specific design target is less import—
ant as long as it does not interact with the important and maybe ex—
plicitly defined structure domains. The improvement and
application of the ‘fuzzy’ constraint concept (e.g. details about pos—
ition or constraint type specific weighting) is a focus of our ongoing
work.

In total, the results are promising and encourage further work,
which will include runtime optimization e.g. based on parallelization
approaches. In addition, the implicit structure constraint is of great
use in future work when modeling multi—structure constraints or
pseudo—knot structures. Furthermore, improving and developing new
internal scoring mechanisms and evaluation patterns is subject of on—
going work, such that the tool can also handle more complex input
structures and their constraints in an adequate way. This inevitably re—
sults in potentially new parameter setups for which we have to update
our understanding of their synergistic effects on antaRNA.

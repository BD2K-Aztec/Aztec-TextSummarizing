Kertesz et al, 2007). Therefore, it is plausible that editing events
may yield similar effects (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. S2).

Other than affecting existing miRNA binding sites, A—to—I
editing can generate novel miRNA/target interactions by either
changing mature miRNA sequences or creating new sites on
UTRs, as already reported by a few studies (Borchert et al,
2009; Kawahara et al, 2007). In Supplementary Material, we
show that deamination of the 3/ UTR of the gene MDM4
could generate a novel binding site for miR—500a—3p.

All these hypotheses and preliminary experiments suggest a
new layer of dynamic regulation in miRNA—mediated gene ex—
pression control and encourage further investigations. We plan
to update the database with new editing sites and new predictions
as soon as new data is available, as well as consider other types of
RNA editing, like C—to—U editing. Moreover, since editing sites in
DARNED do not necessarily reﬂect editing events as they occur
in mRNAs, future work will also include the implementation of
an expressed sequence tags (EST)—based ﬁlter to reﬁne the
miRNA binding site predictions. Finally, we plan to include
data about the editing of miRNA sequences along with their
affected and newly created predicted targets in addition to data
on tissue speciﬁcity of both miRNAs and editing events.

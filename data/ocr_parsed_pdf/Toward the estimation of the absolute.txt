ABSTRACT
Motivation: Quality assessment of protein structures is an important
part of experimental structure validation and plays a crucial role
in protein structure prediction, where the predicted models may
contain substantial errors. Most current scoring functions are
primarily designed to rank alternative models of the same sequence
supporting model selection, whereas the prediction of the absolute
quality of an individual protein model has received little attention in
the field. However, reliable absolute quality estimates are crucial to
assess the suitability of a model for specific biomedical applications.
Results: In this work, we present a new absolute measure for
the quality of protein models, which provides an estimate of the
‘degree of nativeness’ of the structural features observed in a model
and describes the likelihood that a given model is of comparable
quality to experimental structures. Model quality estimates based
on the QMEAN scoring function were normalized with respect to the
number of interactions. The resulting scoring function is independent
of the size of the protein and may therefore be used to assess
both monomers and entire oligomeric assemblies. Model quality
scores for individual models are then expressed as ‘Z-scores’ in
comparison to scores obtained for high-resolution crystal structures.
We demonstrate the ability of the newly introduced QMEAN
Z -score to detect experimentally solved protein structures containing
significant errors, as well as to evaluate theoretical protein models.
In a comprehensive QMEAN Z-score analysis of all experimental
structures in the PDB, membrane proteins accumulate on one side of
the score spectrum and thermostable proteins on the other. Proteins
from the thermophilic organism Thermatoga maritima received
significantly higher QMEAN Z-scores in a pairwise comparison
with their homologous mesophilic counterparts, underlining the
significance of the QMEAN Z-score as an estimate of protein stability.
Availability: The Z-score calculation has been integrated in the
QMEAN server available at: http://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean.

1 INTRODUCTION

In homology modelling, the quality of a model is largely dictated
by the evolutionary distance of the protein of interest (target)

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

to the available template structures. The sensitivity of tools for
detecting remote homologues with very low sequence identity has
increased signiﬁcantly in recent years due to the development of
sophisticated algorithms (Altschul et (11., 1997; Dunbrack, 2006;
Soding, 2005) and growth in sequence databases (Bairoch et (11.,
2005; Tramontano and Morea, 2003). However, with decreasing
sequence similarity, an increasing amount of structural divergence
is observed (Chothia and Lesk, 1986; Rost, 1999), and the resulting
models may contain signiﬁcant inaccuracies, especially models built
on distant templates. Typical sources of errors range from misplaced
side chains, incorrect loop conformations, backbone distortions,
alignment errors, to choice of a template with incorrect fold (Baker
and Sali, 2001; Bordoli et (11., 2009; Koh et (11., 2003).

Ultimately, the accuracy of a protein model determines its
suitability for biomedical applications. However, at the time of
modelling the quality of a model is unknown and has to be predicted
as well. For this purpose, scoring functions have been developed
that evaluate different structural features of protein models in
order to generate a quality estimate. Most scoring functions are
primarily designed to rank alternative models of the same protein
sequence (Benkert et (11., 2008; Eramian et (11., 2008; Marti-Renom
et (11., 2000; McGufﬁn, 2008; Melo and Feytmans, 1998; Pettitt
et (11., 2005; Randall and Baldi, 2008; Samudrala and Moult, 1998;
Tosatto, 2005; Wallner and Elofsson, 2003; Zhou and Zhou, 2002).
However, variability in model quality between different target
proteins is typically by far larger than the variability within the
ensemble of models generated by different prediction methods for
a given protein (Battey et (11., 2007; Koh et (11., 2003; Moult et (11.,
2007). Therefore, relative ranking of alternative models for a given
protein is insufﬁcient for determining its useﬁilness for biomedical
applications such as drug design, mutagenesis experiments, analysis
of ﬁinctional sites, etc. Reliable absolute quality estimates are crucial
for the scientist intending to use computational models (Schwede
et (11., 2009).

The prediction of absolute model quality has rarely been
addressed in the literature: the pioneering tool ProSA (Sippl, 1993)
has primarily been developed to evaluate experimental structures
and estimates the statistical signiﬁcance of a structure by comparing
its knowledge-based score to random structures with the same
sequence. The ProSA Z-score can hardly be used as a measure
of absolute model quality as it is highly dependent on the protein
size (i.e. the energy gap between the native fold and random decoy
structures increases with protein size). Eramian et (11. (2008) apply
support vector regression to estimate the quality of models based
on other modelling cases with similar properties selected from a
large database of precompiled structure-model pairs generated by the

same method. Wang et (11. (2009) express the agreement of a model
with several structural features predicted from the primary sequence
as a reliability measure using the SCRATCH suite (Cheng et (11.,
2005). Most current scoring ﬁinctions operate on individual protein
chains and are not able to deliver quality estimates for biological
assemblies.

In this work, we introduce a method for the estimation of
the absolute quality of individual protein structure models which
is independent of protein size and can be used to both assess
isolated chains as well as entire oligomeric assemblies. The absolute
quality is estimated by relating the model’s structural features
to experimental structures of similar size. Based on our recently
introduced composite scoring ﬁinction QMEAN (Benkert et (11.,
2008, 2009), we analyse different geometrical aspects of proteins.
For normalization, the QMEAN score of a model is compared to
distributions obtained from high-resolution structures solved by
X-ray crystallography. The resulting ‘QMEAN Z-score” provides
an estimate of the ‘degree of nativeness” of the structural features
observed in a model and indicates whether the model is of
comparable quality to experimental structures. The Z-scores of the
individual terms of the scoring function indicate which structural
features of a model exhibit signiﬁcant deviations from the expected
‘native’ behaviour, e.g. unexpected solvent accessibility, back-bone
geometry, inter-atomic packing, etc.

We ﬁrst describe normalized statistical potential terms and
introduce the length-corrected QMEAN scores. We then calculate
normalized QMEAN scores on all experimental structures from the
PDB, and provide an analysis of proteins exhibiting unusually low
and high values. We ﬁnally introduce the concept of the QMEAN
Z-score and demonstrate the strength of the new score for evaluating
both experimental structures and theoretical models.

2 METHODS
2.1 QMEAN

QMEAN is a scoring function consisting of a linear combination of six
structural descriptors as described elsewhere in more detail (Benkert et al..
2008. 2009). In short. two distance-dependent interaction potentials of
mean force based on C-ﬁ atoms (i.e. residue-level) and on all atom types
are used to assess long-range interactionsiboth are secondary structure
dependent; a torsion angle potential over three consecutive amino acids
is applied to analyse the local back-bone geometry of the structure and
a solvation potential to describe the burial status of the residues; ﬁnally.
the agreement of predicted and calculated secondary structure and solvent
accessibility is included in the form of two agreement terms. Secondary
structure prediction is performed by PSIPRED (Jones. 1999) and solvent
accessibility prediction with ACCpro (Cheng et al.. 2005). The secondary
structure and solvent accessibility of the model are calculated by DSSP
(Kabsch and Sander. 1983). While the agreement terms have a signiﬁcant
impact on the performance of QMEAN on theoretical models. they do
not add additional information when experimental structures are evaluated.
Evaluations on experimental structures are therefore based on the normalized
QMEAN4 score (i.e. statistical potential terms only).

The optimization of the weighting factors for the terms contributing to
QMEAN has been performed on models from the seventh round of the CASP
experiment (CASP7) (Moult et al.. 2007). To evaluate the performance on
an independent dataset. QMEAN has been applied on all server models
submitted to CASPS. The length-normalized statistical potentials scores are
calculated as follows: the scores of single body potentials (solvation potential
and torsion angle potential) are normalized by the number of residues and the

scores of the non-bonded interaction potentials (all-atom and C-ﬁ potential)
are divided by the total number of interactions.

GDT_TS values for the benchmark were parsed from the CASPS
website and quality assessment predictions downloaded from:
http://predictioncenter.org/download_area/CASP8/predictions/QA.tar.gz.

2.2 Datasets

‘PDB training set”: the statistical potentials were extracted from a non-
redundant set of high-resolution structures from the PDB (Berman et al..
2000) selected using the PISCES server (Wang and Dunbrack. 2003). A
pairwise sequence identity cut-off of 20% is applied and only structures
solved by X-ray crystallography with a resolution better than 2 A and R-Value
below 0.25 are included. resulting in a total number of 3544 chains.

‘CASP7 training set”: the weighing factors of the QMEAN composite
score were optimized based on CASP7 models (human and server) (Moult
et al.. 2007) using the GDT_TS score as target variable (Zemla. 2003). From
the initial set of 47 214 evaluated models. incomplete models covering <95%
of the target sequence or lacking side-chain atoms for >10% of the amino
acids were removed. The ﬁnal CASP7 training set contains 34 322 models
from various modelling servers.

‘CASP8 test set”: a total of 31 491 server models from CASPS were used
as an independent test set for the comparison of different implementations
of QMEAN and for assessing the performance of the QMEAN Z-score.

‘PDB reference set”: a non-redundant reference set of high-resolution
PDB structures for the QMEAN Z-score calculation was generated by
PISCES using to following criteria: structures longer than 30 amino acids
solved by X-ray crystallography. with pairwise sequence identity below
40% and resolution better than 25A were included. resulting in 9766
structures. Proteins annotated as transmembrane proteins (White. 2009) were
excluded. Also. 18 low-scoring outliers showing a normalized QMEANscore
(without agreement terms) deviating by more than 3 standard deviations were
excluded from the PDB reference set. A complete list of these structures with
high scores is provided as Supplementary Data Table $1. The ﬁnal ”PDB
reference set” contains 9451 entries.

‘Biological unit reference set': this set contains the biological assemblies
of all chains from the PDB reference set. The PISA database (Krissinel
and Henrick. 2007) was used to assign the most likely oligomeric state
and generate the coordinates of the assembly for all entries of the
dataset. The resulting set contains biological units from 9062 unique PDB
identiﬁersi2999 of them are monomers. A ‘biological active assembly” may
contain multiple chains from the non-redundant chain list.

2.3 QMEAN Z -score

To calculate the QMEAN Z-score. the normalized raw scores of a given
model (composite QMEAN score and individual mean force potential
terms) are compared to scores obtained for a representative set of high-
resolution X-ray structures of similar size (number of residues of query
proteins :l:10%). For the analysis of isolated chains. the ‘PDB reference
set” is used and oligomeric assemblies are evaluated against the ‘biological
unit reference set'. The same procedure is applied to calculate Z-scores
for the agreement terms. i.e. for each structure in the two reference
sets PSIPRED and ACCpro have been applied to model the background
distribution of expected secondary structure and solvent accessibility
prediction accuracy.

The raw QMEAN score and the individual terms have different scales
and algebraic signs: QMEAN and agreement terms range from 0 to 1
and the statistical potential terms deliver pseudo energies with negative
values for energetically favourable states. In the Z-score calculations.
we adjusted the Sign of the statistical terms such that higher Z-score
consistently relate to favourable states. i.e. higher QMEAN Z-score means
better agreement with predicted features and lower mean force potential
energy.

2.4 Cross-validation

In order to investigate the saturation of the statistics in the QMEAN score
calculation and to exclude over-training. a cross-validation experiment has
been performed in the form of a leave-1/3-out experiment on the original
dataset used to extract the statistical potentials (i.e. the PDB training set).
We trained the statistical potentials on 2/3 of the proteins from the original
training set and applied the QMEAN score on the remaining 1/3 of the
structures. We randomly selected 31 complete SCOP fold classes making up
roughly 1/3 of the original set (1523 PDB chains). This results in two sets
having no overlap in terms of folds. If the statistics is saturated. the predicted
scores of a structure from the test set should not differ considerably between
the two potentials implementations. i.e. the one based on the full and the
reduced training set. The cross-correlation coefﬁcient between the original
QMEAN and the QMEAN score trained on 2/3 of the training set is 0.88
which underlines that the QMEAN score calculation is robust and does not
change strongly if applied on folds not used in the generation of the statistical
potentials (Figure S7 in the Supplementary Data).

2.5 Comparison of predicted protein stability between
thermophilic and mesophilic organisms

The dataset of pairs of homologous proteins as described in Robinson-
Rechavi and Godzik (Robinson-Rechavi and Godzik. 2005) has been used.
Three protein structures have in the meantime been superseded by newer
entries in the PDB: 1un7 has been replaced by 2Vhl. lnrh by 1u8x and ljsv
by 2atb. One pair of homologues of the original dataset has been excluded
(1 g6p from Tmaritima.1c9o from Bacillus cala'olyticus) since both are from
thermophilic organisms. The ﬁnal dataset consist of 72 protein pairs.

As in the work of Robinson-Rechavi and Godzik. proteins were shortened
according to a structural alignment (FATCAT w/o ﬂexibility. (Ye and Godzik.
2003)) in order to get homologous protein pairs of similar size.

2.6 Implementation
The current version of the QMEAN scoring function has been implemented

based on the open source molecular modelling and Visualization framework
OpenStructure (www.0penstructure.org) (Biasini et al.. 2010).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Normalization of the statistical potentials

Statistical potential scores are calculated as a sum of microstates
and therefore have a strong dependence on the size of the assessed
protein structure and larger proteins tend to have lower energies
(i.e. higher QMEAN scores). As long as similarly sized models are
compared, the strong size dependence does not present an issue.
However, it renders the prediction of absolute quality difﬁcult when
only looking at single models.

In this work, we introduce normalized statistical potential
QMEAN terms. In order to correct for the length dependence of
the statistical potentials scores, the scores of single body potentials
(solvation potential and torsion angle potential) are normalized
by the number of residues and the scores of the two non-bonded
interaction potentials (all-atom and C-5 potential) are divided by the
total number of interactions considered in the calculation. Figure 1
shows the effect of the normalization on the all-atom potential. The
all-atom energies of a non-redundant set of 9766 protein structures
(single chains) solved by X-ray crystallography are calculated as
normalized and non-normalized scores.

A clear correlation with protein size is observed (Fig. 1, left)
for the standard all-atom potential whereas the average energy per
interaction of the normalized potential converges to an average value

of —0.0058:l:0.0017 (Fig. 1, right). This is in accordance with
recent results of Thomas et (11. (Thomas et (11., 2010) who report
an average stability value for protein folds. Smaller proteins adopt a
wider range of average per-interaction energies in accordance with
the fact that small peptides often exist as a diverse ensemble of
conformations or are stabilized in larger complexes. Indeed, the
peptides with the highest, i.e. most unfavourable, energies in the
dataset are the ribosomal protein THX [PDB22vqe, (Kurata et (11.,
2008)] and the disordered protein hypocretin presented on a MHC
class II protein [PDBz 1uvq (Siebold et (11., 2004)]. On the other side
of the energy spectrum, we observe three peptide hormones namely
hepcidin [PDBz3h0t (Jordan et (11., 2009)], endothelin-l [PDBz 1edn
(Janes et (11., 1994)] and relaxin [PDBz6rlx (Eigenbrot et (11., 1991)]
with predicted per-interaction energies far below the average value
reported above. Energy values and their interpretation are given in
Table S2 in the Supplementary Data.

We analysed protein chains with more than 100 amino acids
having high predicted interaction energies. The 27 protein chains
with highest average interaction values (more precisely those with
positive per-interaction energies) all are membrane proteins. These
results conﬁrm that the structural features of membrane proteins do
not follow the same distribution as proteins in solution, i.e. atomic
interactions in membrane proteins and their solvation properties
differ considerably from those found in soluble proteins. We decided
that these proteins are better treated in a specialized mean force
potential. A variant of the QMEAN score for membrane proteins is
currently underdevelopment.

In analogy to the all-atom term, the other three statistical
potentials of QMEAN have been normalized and for larger proteins
show convergence to an average per residue energy, although with
a higher variance (see Figure S1—S3 in the Supplementary Data).
The same is true for the composite score of the four statistical
potentials scores (QMEAN4, Fig. 2). In the course of the article,
‘QMEAN’ denotes the complete scoring ﬁinction consisting of six
terms based on normalized potentials. The version of the scoring
function based on statistical potentials only is denoted as QMEAN4
in the following.

3.2 PDB reference set and QMEAN Z-score concept

In analogy to the average energy per interaction, the average
normalized QMEAN4 score is constant over a wide range of
protein sizes, i.e. experimental structures adopt a relatively narrow
distribution of QMEAN4 scores. While the average normalized

for details).

score is constant, the variance of the distribution depends on protein
size (Fig. 2).

These observations lead to the idea to use a non-redundant set of
protein structures as a reference to evaluate the quality of individual
protein structures and models, i.e. the PDB reference set. The dataset
contains 9451 non-redundant high-resolution structures, excluding
membrane proteins and energetic outliers (highlighted in Fig. 2). A
QMEAN Z-score for a given model is thereby calculated from its
normalized QMEAN score by subtracting the average normalized
QMEAN score and divided by the standard deviation of the observed
distribution. In analogy, Z-scores are calculated for all individual
terms of the composite score. In order to facilitate the interpretation,
we standardize the algebraic sign of the calculated Z-scores such that
higher Z-scores relate to more favourable models.

In the following, we ﬁrst illustrate the application of QMEAN
Z-score for quality estimation on two example proteins, representing
a ‘good’ and a ‘bad’ experimental structure. We then extend our
analysis on the entire PDB (single chains) and report outliers. The
QMEAN Z-score concept is then extended from chains to entire
biologically relevant oligomeric assemblies. Finally, we show that
the new score can be used as a measure of absolute model quality
in the assessment of theoretical models.

3.3 QMEAN Z-score analysis of experimental
structures

We have applied QMEAN Z-scores to experimental structures from
the PDB database (Berman et (11., 2000). Table 1 and Supplementary
Figure S5 show the Z-scores analysis of two experimental structures
solved by X-ray diffraction: bacteriophage T4 lysozyme [PDB :2lzm,
(Weaver and Matthews, 1987)] and Dengue virus NS3 serine
protease [PDlebef, (2009; Murthy et (11., 1999)]. The QMEAN
Z-score of the lysozyme structure is 0.5, i.e. the score of the structure
is clearly within the expected quality range as it deviates less
than 1 standard deviation from the mean score in similar sized
high-quality proteins from the reference dataset. In contrast, the
structure of the NS3 serine protease has a QMEAN score deviating

Both the QMEAN Z-score as well as the Z-scores of individual statistical potential terms
are reported. All structural properties of lbef deviate signiﬁcantly from expectation
values obtained from high-resolution structures. In the meantime, the structure has
been retracted from the PDB.

by more than 5 standard deviations indicating that there is clearly
something wrong with this structure. Both the composite QMEAN
score, as well as all individual terms deviate strongly from expected
values (Figure S5, Supplementary Data and Table 1). Indeed, this
structure, as well as several other structures from the same group,
have been identiﬁed as fabricated and have been retracted (see
http://www.wwpdb.org/U AB .html). A QMEAN Z-score analysis of
all affected structures can be found in Supplementary Table S3.

The ProSA (Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007) analysis of the two
structure can be found in Supplementary Figure S6. The lysozyme
structure receives a very low Z-scores of —8.7. The fabricated
structure lbef, however, also deviates by almost 4 standard
deviations from random structures (Z-score = —3.74). In comparison
to QMEAN, the score of this model does not differ considerably from
many other structures in the PDB. In contrast to QMEAN, the ProSA
Z-score shows a clear correlation with protein size which limits
its application as an absolute quality measure. We therefore think
that a comparison to high-resolution structures instead of random
conformations is more meaningful.

We performed the QMEAN Z-score analysis on 144 142 protein
chains from the PDB. Of these chains, 134 604 were solved by X-ray
diffraction, 7979 by NMR and 1559 by electron microscopy. The
Z-score distributions for structures derived by the three different
methods show considerable differences (Supplementary Figure S4).
The average QMEAN Z-scores are —0.58 for X-ray diffraction,
— 1 . 19 for NMR and —2.00 for EM. Among the protein chains solved
by X-ray crystallography we observed 1”048 chains (belonging to
417 PDB entries) with a QMEAN Z-score less than —5. The majority
of these proteins were either transmembrane or ribosomal proteins:
61 membrane proteins, 99 oxidoreductases, 109 proteins involved
in photosynthesis, 46 transporters and 55 ribosomal proteins. These
numbers underline the importance of a separate treatment of proteins
embedded in membranes or bound to RNA, e.g. ribosomes. The
remaining 48 proteins with unfavourable QMEAN Z-scores are
provided in the Supplementary Data (Table S4). The majority of
these structures are of quite low resolution: 79% of the proteins
were solved at a resolution <3 A.

To this point, we have applied the Z-score formalism on isolated
protein chains. However, many proteins are part of oligomeric
complexes and analysing protein stability on the level of isolated
chains does not capture the physiologically relevant situation in the
cell. We have therefore extended our analysis to complete oligomeric
assemblies. Figure 3 illustrates this effect on the example of toxoﬁlin
in complex with mammalian actin [PDB22Q97, (Lee et (11., 2007)].
In the complex toxoﬁlin (chain T, blue) adopts a non-globular
conformation, which is meaningless in isolation. As expected, the
QMEAN Z-score of —3.3 for toxoﬁlin (chain T) in isolation is

The biological unit reference set contains the most likely
biologically relevant oligomeric assembly generated by PISA
(Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). Figure 4 shows the QMEAN scores
of 9062 oligomeric entries of the biological unit reference set
(see Section 2). This dataset is used as a reference set for the
assessment of complexes and oligomeric proteins. All structures
with extraordinarily high QMEAN scores (Z-score >3 standard
deviations; 26 structures) are highlighted with green crosses.
Interestingly, 22 out of these 26 are proteins from thermophilic to
hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea, two are designed proteins
optimized for stability, and the remaining two are structural
genomics targets of unknown function (Supplementary Table S5).

In summary, the proteins at the periphery of the QMEAN score
spectrum can be assigned to membrane proteins which exist in a
fundamentally different environment compared to soluble proteins
and extremely stable proteins found in thermophilic organisms.

3.4 Comparison of homologous proteins from
thermophilic and mesophilic organisms

The composite scoring function QMEAN seems to capture structural

features which distinguish thermostable proteins from proteins in

mesophilic organisms. In order to ﬁirther investigate which terms

are most discriminative, we applied QMEAN on a published dataset

of pairs of proteins from Thermatoga maritima and corresponding
homologues from mesophilic organisms (Robinson-Rechavi and
Godzik, 2005). Out of 72 protein pairs, QMEAN assigns in
75% of the cases higher scores to the proteins from Tmaritima.
Over the entire data set, the difference between the QMEAN
scores assigned to mesophilic and thermophilic proteins is highly
signiﬁcant (P = 0.0001, see Table 3). The comparison is illustrated in
form of a diagonal plot in Supplementary Figure S8. These ﬁndings
indicate that the QMEAN score indeed may be understood as a
measure of protein stability.

In agreement with a study on Thermatoga maritima in which
the authors identiﬁed salt bridges and compactness as major
determinants of protein stability (Robinson-Rechavi et (11., 2006),
we observe that the solvation potential and the interaction potentials
on residue-level are the most discriminative terms (P=0.002 for
both terms in paired t-test).

3.5 Analysis of theoretical models using normalized
QMEAN scores and QMEAN Z-scores

In the following, the normalized QMEAN scoring ﬁinction is applied
on theoretical models from CASP8 and its performance is compared
to other methods. We demonstrate the value of the QMEAN Z-score
as a statistically well-founded measure of absolute quality and end

with a critical discussion of the limitations of this approach for
predicting absolute local per-residue errors.

CASP data is a good testing ground for scoring functions since
it includes models spanning a wide range of quality generated
by a variety of different modelling algorithms. Figure 5 shows
the global correlation between the size-normalized QMEAN score
and the GDT_TS distance to the native structure of all CASP8
server models. A global correlation coefﬁcient of 0.77 overall
CASP8 models is obtained. QMEAN6 scores perform signiﬁcantly
better than QMEAN4 to estimate the quality of predicted structures
(correlation on CASP8 data was 0.77 versus 0.66). While for
assessing experimental structures, the agreement terms do not
provide additional value, these terms are especially effective in the
medium to low model quality range (Rykunov and Fiser, 2010).

Table 4 shows a comparison of the normalized QMEAN scoring
ﬁinction (denoted as QMEANnorm) with methods participating in
the quality estimation category of CASP8 (CozzettO et (11., 2009).
Only scoring ﬁinctions operating on individual models are used
(i.e. no consensus methods and methods using structural information
from homologous proteins). Compared to the original QMEAN
scoring ﬁinction, the normalized QMEAN shows a considerably
better global correlation to GDT_TS which forms the basis for
absolute quality predictions. The new version is also signiﬁcantly
better in ranking the models (P=0.017) while the difference in
picking the good models (mean delta GDT_TS of selected and best
model) is not signiﬁcant (P = 0.43). MetaMQAP and MULTICOM-
REFINE have a slightly better global r but the former performs
signiﬁcantly worse in model ranking/selection. In terms of global
correlation, the three methods perform equally well on easy targets
(mean GDT_TS of top 5 models greater than 50) but QMEAN
performs worse on the harder ones (see Supplementary Tables S6
and S7). The performance of QMEAN with respect to other state-
of—the-art methods such as ProSA (Sippl, 1993) and DFIRE (Zhou
and Zhou, 2002) has also been recently assessed in an independent
study (Rykunov and Fiser, 2010). QMEAN was found to be the best
performing method in terms of the selecting the best model.

The robustness of the QMEAN Z-score on experimental structures
lead us to apply the same concept to describe the absolute quality of
theoretical protein structure models. Large deviations from expected
values of experimental reference structures may be an indicator for
modelling errors. The signiﬁcance of the deviation as expressed
by the QMEAN Z-score provides a quantitative and statistically
well-founded measure of model reliability and therefore represents
an absolute quality estimate of the model. (Note that the Z-score

Figure 6 visualizes the differences in the QMEAN6 Z-score
distributions between experimental structures of the PDB reference
set (black line) and the CASP8 server models coloured according
to model quality ranges (i.e. the GDT_TS distance to the native
structure). The Z-score distribution of low-quality models with
GDT_TS below 40 is clearly shifted towards lower Z-scores
compared to experimental structures (mean Z-score = —3.85). Only
a small overlap of the distributions is observed: 85% of the
bad models with a Z-score above —2 are small structures below
150 residues. As can be seen in Figure 2, the variance of the
QMEAN score increases with decreasing size and as a consequence
the separation between good and bad structures becomes less
pronounced (see also Supplementary Figure S9). Another reason
for the overlap of the distributions is that 36% of the overlapping
bad models are incomplete with <80% residues resolved which
lowers the GDT_TS score but not the normalized QMEAN score.
The ‘good’ models depicted in green reach QMEAN Z-scores
comparable to experimental structures (mean Z-score = —0.65) and
the ‘medium’ quality models (in blue) are located in between
(mean Z-score: —l.75). A clear correlation between the GDT_TS
distance of the model to target structure and the QMEAN Z-score
for all CASP8 server models larger than 150 residues is observed

underlining the suitability of the QMEAN Z-score as an estimate of
model quality (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S10).

The prediction of local (per-residue) error estimates is an active
ﬁeld of research. For our previously introduced local QMEAN
score (QMEANlocal) (Benkert et (11., 2009), normalized interaction
potentials lead to a slight performance increase (data not shown).
However, the precision of current local scoring functions applied on
single models is not sufﬁcient as reliable absolute quality estimate.
Nevertheless, a distinction between more and less deviating regions
is still possible. Supplementary Figures S 11 (boxplot) and S12 (ROC
analysis) show the performance of QMEANlocal in estimating
per-residue errors on all CASP8 models. Only a weak correlation
between local score and C-Oi deviation exists. The ROC analysis
shows that QMEANlocal is able to enrich residues from the models
with low deviation from the native structure. More than half of the
residues with a calculated C-Oi deviation below 2.5 A are identiﬁed
among the 10% best scoring residues.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we present a new method for estimating the
absolute quality of a single protein structure, i.e. without including
additional information from other models or alternative template
structures. The measure is based on the composite scoring ﬁinction
QMEAN which evaluates several structural features of proteins.
The absolute quality estimate of a model is expressed in terms
of how well the model score agrees with the expected values
from a representative set of high resolution experimental structures.
The resulting QMEAN Z-score is a measure of the ‘degree of
nativeness” of a given protein structure. The Z-scores of the
individual components of the composite QMEAN score point to
structural descriptors that contribute most to the ﬁnal score, and
thereby indicate potential reasons for ‘bad’ models.

A large-scale benchmark of experimental structures revealed
two groups of proteins on the periphery of the QMEAN score
distribution: on one side there are membrane proteins whose
structural integrity is maintained by the lipid bilayer and as a
consequence their physico-chemical properties differ considerably
from those of soluble proteins. On the other side of the
QMEAN score spectrum, proteins from thermophilic organisms
are predominant. In a direct comparison of pairs of homologous
proteins, proteins from thermophilic organisms receive signiﬁcantly
higher QMEAN scores compared to their mesophilic counterparts.

Finally, we show that the QMEAN Z-score is a useful measure
for the description of the absolute quality of theoretical models and
is a valuable measure for identifying experimental structures with
signiﬁcant errors. Compared to most existing scoring functions,
QMEAN Z-scores can be both applied on isolated chains or
biological assemblies.

The QMEAN Z-score calculation has been integrated in the
QMEAN server (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean) (Benkert
et (11., 2009), and the ‘Structure Assessment” tools of SWISS-
MODEL Workspace (Arnold et (11., 2006; Schwede et (11., 2003)
(http://swissmodel.expasy.org/workspace/). A stand-alone version is
available on request from the authors.

modiﬁcation data rather than TF binding data and also mana—
ged to explain a high degree of expression variance (r: 0.74).

In this study, we use TF binding, histone modiﬁcation and
chromatin accessibility data to address three major questions:
(i) can we accurately predict gene expression using in silico pre—
dictions of TF binding rather than in vivo binding data? (ii) Does
adding histone modiﬁcation and chromatin accessibility data im—
prove the accuracy of predicted gene expression? (iii) Are weak
binding sites important to accurately predict gene expression?

To answer these questions, we derive log—linear regression—
based models that relate gene expression to the binding of 12
different TFs, to 7 histone modifications and to chromatin ac—
cessibility. We find that expression models based on computa—
tionally predicted TF binding can achieve similar accuracy to
those using in vivo TF binding data and that including binding
at weak sites is critical for accurate prediction of gene expression.
We also ﬁnd that incorporating histone modiﬁcation and chro—
matin accessibility data results in additional accuracy.
Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that models that use no TF binding data
at all, but only histone modiﬁcation and chromatin accessibility
data, are essentially as accurate as those based on in vivo TF
binding data.

2 METHODS

To predict gene expression, we build a log-linear regression model of gene
expression as a function of TF binding, histone modiﬁcations and chro-
matin accessibility. Each gene is represented as a vector of features, where
each feature represents either the predicted binding of a TF, the presence
of a histone modiﬁcation or the chromatin accessibility around the tran-
scription start site (TSS) of the gene. The model is ﬁt to the level of the
expression of each gene as measured by RNA-seq.

2.1 Predicting TF binding (TF affinity scores)

For each TFigene pair, we integrate either measured or predicted TF
binding around each gene promoter into a single TF afﬁnity score
(TFAS) using a weighted sum, where the weight decreases exponentially
as a function of distance from the TSS. Following the deﬁnition given by
Ouyang et a]. (2009), we deﬁne the TFAS, A,-,~, for the ith gene and the jth
TF as the weighted sum over all predicted binding sites (k) as:

Azu- = nge’w“, (1)
k

where gk is the score of an individual predicted TF binding site. We
weight the contribution of each site to our integrated TFAS by the ex-
ponential decay term e’d’l/d“, where dk is the distance in base pairs of the
putative binding site (k) from the TSS and do determines the decay rate.
Following Ouyang et a]. (2009), we set do = 5000 for all TFs except E2f 1,
where we set d0=500 (Ouyang et al., 2009). We only include in this
weighted sum putative binding sites within 30 000 bp of the TSS, as the
weighted contributions of more distant sites are negligible. We evaluate
four methods for predicting individual binding sites and assigning indi-
vidual site scores (g), which we discuss below. We then log transform
and quantile normalize the TFAS matrix A (Bolstad et al., 2003).

2.1.1 ChIP—seq site affinity scores We use measured ChIP-seq
binding data for the 12 TFs from the Supplementary Material supplied
by Ouyang et a]. (2009), which contains pre-calculated and normalized
TFASs, where gk is the height (in mapped tags) of each declared ChIP-seq
peak.

2.1.2 Non—tissue—speczfic in silico (position weight matrix ) site
affinity scores We perform a position weight matrix (PWM) scan of
the entire genome using FIMO (Grant et al., 2011). We use the default
options, which apply a P-value threshold of 10’4 to predict matches and
a pseudocount of 0.1. For our binding site afﬁnity scores (gk), we use the
log-likelihood score of each predicted site reported by FIMO.

2.1.3 T issue—speczfic in silico (PWM +H3K4me3) site affinity
scores As gene expression is tissue-speciﬁc, our third TF binding site
prediction method integrates tissue-speciﬁc epigenetic data with PWM
scanning. We use FIMO with a histone-based prior (Cuellar Partida
et al., 2012) using H3K4me3 data, as it has previously been shown to
be effective as a ﬁlter for predicting TF binding sites (W hitington et al.,
2009). Using the tools published in Cuellar Partida et a]. (2012), we create
a prior from the Mikkelsen et a]. (2007) H3K4me3 data. We use param-
eters ﬂ = 1 and at = 4 X 105. We scan the genome using this prior and the
default FIMO settings. For our site afﬁnity scores (gk), we use the
log-posterior ratio scores reported by FIMO.

2.2 Measuring histone modiﬁcations and chromatin
accessibility (histone and DNase scores)

We calculate histone modification scores (histone scores) and chromatin
accessibility scores (DNase scores) for each histone modiﬁcation and for
DNase I hypersensitivity at the TSS of each gene. Taking a region :|:2000
bases relative to the TSS, we sum the number of mapped tags for each
histone modiﬁcation and for DNase (see Section 2.5). We deﬁne ZR for
gene i and histone modiﬁcation or DNase score k as:

2000
Z). = Z TC(k,i,n), (2)
":72000
where TC(k, i, n) is the number of mapped sequence tags for histone
modiﬁcation or DNase I hypersensitivity k at position n relative to
gene i’s TSS. As we do above for the TFASs, we then log-transform
and quantile normalize the matrix Z (Bolstad et al., 2003).

2.3 Linear regression
We describe genome-wide gene expression by a log-linear model:

where Y,- is the expression level for gene i, p, is the basal expression level,
A,-,~ is the jth TFAS for the ith gene and ﬂ) is the ﬁtted coefﬁcient for the
jth TFAS. Similarly, Z) is the jth histone or DNase score for the ith gene
and y) the ﬁtted coefﬁcient for the jth histone modiﬁcation or DNase
score. 6,- is the gene-speciﬁc error term. a is a ﬁtted term to avoid taking
log(0); we ﬁt (I using a held-out 20% of our data. To obtain conﬁdence
intervals, we bootstrap the regression 1000 times on the remaining 80%
of our data.

2.4 Linear regression with principal component analysis

We decompose a matrix, C, consisting of the column-wise concatenation
of our TFAS matrix, A and our histone and DNase score matrix, Z, using
the singular-value decomposition C: U2 VT, as described in Ouyang
et a]. (2009). We create the matrix X: U2, which is of the form X,,,
where the columns are the principal components (PCs) and the rows
are genes.

Using this transformed data, we perform the regression,

2.5 Data

2 .5 .1 Mouse embryonic stem cells The TSS of genes is taken from
the gene annotation dataset for the mouse genome (mm8/NCBIM36.46)
from the Ensembl FTP server (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/). To exclude the
possibility that we include multiple transcripts or isoforms of the same
gene in our regression, we use the most 5’-located TSS from the Ensembl
gene annotation data as each gene’s TSS. We also exclude all genes from
haplotype variants and unmapped contig regions. This, combined with
the removal of any genes with low conﬁdence RNA-seq mapping, leaves
a set of 18008 genes for analysis.

Histone modiﬁcation ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1, H3K4me2,
H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H4K20me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 are
from Mikkelsen et al. (2007) and Meissner et al. (2008) pre-compiled
‘density’ ﬁles (similar to ‘wig’ ﬁles).

Raw DNase I hypersensitivity sequence tags are from Schnetz et al.
(2010), which we mapped using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009).

We use TF ChIP-seq data for E2f1, Esrrb, Klf4, c-Myc, n-Myc,
Nanog, Oct4, Smadl, Sox2 and Stat3 from Chen et al. (2008).
Position weight matrices (PWMs) describing the DNA-binding prefer-
ences (motifs) for Esrrb, Klf4, c-Myc, n-Myc and Stat3 are taken from
Chen et al. (2008). For E2f1, Nanog and Smadl, we use PWMs from
UniProbe (Berger and Bulyk, 2009), JASPAR (Portales-Casamar et al.,
2010) and TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2003), respectively. For Oct4 and
Sox2, for which Chen et al. (2008) reported a composite Oct-Sox motif,
we trimmed off the non-Oct and non-Sox portion from the Oct4 and
Sox2 motifs, respectively. For full details, please see the Supplementary
Material.

We use an extremely deep RNA-seq mouse expression dataset
(Cloonan et al., 2008), which was re-normalized in reads per kilobase
of exon per million tags (RKPM) by Ouyang et al. (2009). RKPM has
been previously shown to be proportional to mRNA abundance
(Mortazavi et al., 2008).

2.5.2 GM12878 cells The TSS of genes is taken from the gene
annotation dataset for the human genome (hg19/GRCh37) from the
Ensembl FTP server (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/). To exclude the possibility
that we include multiple transcripts or isoforms of the same gene in our
regression, we use the most 5’-located TSS from the Ensembl gene anno-
tation data as each gene’s TSS. We also exclude all genes from haplotype
variants and unmapped contig regions. This, combined with the removal
of any genes with low conﬁdence RNA-seq mapping, leaves a set of
37458 genes for analysis.

Histone modiﬁcation ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1, H3K4me2,
H4K20me1, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 are from the ENCODE project
‘bigWig’ ﬁles produced by the Broad laboratory (ENCODE, 2011).
H3K4me3 was remapped onto hg19 from the ‘fastq’ ﬁle produced by
the Broad laboratory using BowTie (Langmead et al., 2009). Raw
DNase I hypersensitivity data are from the ‘signal’ bigWig file produced
by the Duke laboratory as part of the ENCODE project (ENCODE,
2011).

We use TF ChIP-seq data for c-Fos, thf, Egrl, Nrf 1 Nrsf, Pou2f2,
Spl, Srf, Stat3, Usfl and Yyl.

We also use an ENCODE-provided RNA-seq dataset for our
GM12878 gene expression data, which we mapped onto hg19 and nor-
malized into RKPM using TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009). Full details on
the sources of the RNA-seq data, ChIP-seq data and the PWMs are
provided in the Supplementary Material.

2.6 Implementation

We implement the log-linear regression models in R (R Development
Core Team, 2008). All R scripts, motifs and data (including expression
data, TFASs, histone and DNase scores) are available online at http://
researchimb.uq.edu.au/t.bailey/supplementary_data/McLeay2011a/.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Using in silico TF binding predictions to model
gene expression

We ﬁrst explore whether in silico TF binding predictions can
replace ChIP—seq binding measurements. To do this, we build
models using only TF binding features and compare models of
gene expression based on TF ChIP—seq binding data with models
based on in silico TF binding estimates (Fig. 1a). As expected,
models using in vivo measurements of TF binding (ChIP—seq
TFAS) explain substantially more variance (adjusted
R2 = 0.644; Fig. 1a, bar 3) than models using either the non—tis—
sue—speciﬁc in silico (PWM) or tissue—speciﬁc in silico
(PWM+H3K4me3) afﬁnity scores. We find that a model
using tissue—speciﬁc in silico TF binding predictions (PWM scan—
ning with a H3K4me3 prior) is much more predictive of expres—
sion than the non—tissue—speciﬁc in silico afﬁnity score model
(adjusted R2=O.S2l and adjusted R2=O.279; Fig. 1a, bars 1
and 2, respectively), nearly doubling the explained variance.

We hypothesize that possibly one or more of the TFs are
poorly described by their PWM, hampering the performance of
our models that use in silico binding predictions. To explore this,
we take the ChIP—seq TFAS model and replace a single TF with
the equivalent tissue—specific in silico data. Replacing the single
E2f1 tissue—speciﬁc in silico TFAS with ChIP—seq E2f1 data
yields a model that is statistically indistinguishable from one
using all 12 ChIP—seq datasets (Fig. 1b, top two bars.
R2 20.630 and R2=O.644, respectively, error bars overlap).
Replacing any other tissue—speciﬁc in silico TFAS with a
ChIP—seq TFAS has either minimal or no effect (Fig. 1b, com—
pare bottom bar with others), with the exception of Sox2, where
its inclusion surprisingly decreases R2 (see Section 4). Thus, with
our in silico method and ChIP—seq data for one TF, we can
achieve indistinguishable accuracy to using 12 ChIP—seq datasets.

Having observed that E2f1 is the sole TF, where replacing
tissue—speciﬁc in silico E2f1 data with ChIP—seq TF data is sufﬁ—
cient to increase explained gene expression variance to be indis—
tinguishable from using 12 TF ChIP—seq datasets, we also
examine whether in an all ChIP—seq TFAS model, replacing
the E2f1 ChIP—seq data with in silico data decreases the accuracy
of the model. In our model using all ChIP—seq TFASs, we ﬁnd
that replacing any ChIP—seq TFAS except E2f1 with
PWM + H3K4me3 data has no statistically signiﬁcant effect on
model accuracy (Fig. 1c, compare bottom bar with others).
Replacing E2f1 ChIP—seq TFAS with the E2f1
PWM+H3K4me3 TFAS, however, causes a large decrease in
R2, suggesting that the tissue—speciﬁc in silico binding predictions
fail to completely capture the binding of E2f 1. For any other TF
in the model, replacing ChIP—seq data with tissue—speciﬁc in silico
binding data causes no significant decrease in accuracy.

When we regress each ChIP—seq TFAS alone against expres—
sion (‘Results’ section in the Supplementary Material; Fig. 3), we

than the model based solely on TF ChIP—seq data (Fig. 5,
bars 3 and 5).

We note that compared with our previous results in mES cells,
each model explains comparatively less expression variance in
GM12878 cells (compare Figs 1a and 2 with Fig. 5). For ex—
ample, the best performing model in both tissuesiChIP—seq
binding measurements combined with histone modiﬁcation and
chromatin accessibility data%xplains 830% less of the total
gene expression variance in GM12878 cells than in mES cells
(R2 20.412 and R2 20.695, respectively). As noted earlier, this
may be partially due to the TFs used in the model. Additionally,
one of the most informative histone modifications in mES cells,
H4K20me3 (Fig. 4) was unavailable for GM12878 cells.

We also measure correlation between actual and predicted ex—
pression in GM12878 cells for each regression model and per—
form the singular value decomposition regressions in GM12878
cells and these results are included in the Supplementary
Material.

4 DISCUSSION

We have successfully explained the majority of variance in gene
expression in mES cells by building an integrated model of 12
TFs, seven histone modifications and DNase hypersensitivity
data. In fact, we ﬁnd that gene expression levels predicted by
both the tissue—specific in silico models and the histone modiﬁ—
cation and DNase—only model are more highly correlated with
mESC RNA—seq gene expression data than microarray data
from the same tissue type. The wide availability of TF binding
site motifs (Berger and Bulyk, 2009; Matys et al., 2003;
Portales—Casamar et al., 2010) gives our in silico method the ad—
vantage of allowing the evaluation of many different TFs with—
out the cost and time required to perform TF ChIP—seq
experiments, instead requiring only a PWM and H3K4me3
data in the tissue of interest.

Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that using the seven histone modiﬁca—
tions and chromatin accessibility (DNase) data alone produces
a model as descriptive of expression as one using 12 TF ChIP—seq
datasets. By using histone modiﬁcations and DNase data alone,
we explain more variation (up to 870 %) in gene expression than
other studies that use more complex in silico models of TF bind—
ing, which vary from 811% (Das et al., 2006) to 833% (Das
et al., 2004). Several of these models incorporate TFiTF inter—
actions and other higher order effects compared with our simpler
log—linear regression models. We also ﬁnd that models combining
histone data with TF ChIP—seq data outperform models using
TF ChIP—seq data alone. This suggests that the histone modiﬁ—
cations perhaps capture an ‘expression state’, containing infor—
mation not captured by our 12 TFs.

Although using tissue—speciﬁc in silico (PWM+H3K4me3)
predictions of our 12 TFs alone does achieve a less—accurate ﬁt
to RNA—seq expression data than using 12 ChIP—seq TFAS, we
ﬁnd that replacing a single TFAS (E2f 1) with ChIP—seq data
improves the accuracy of our tissue—speciﬁc in silico method to
be indistinguishable from using all 12 ChIP—seq TFASs.
We hypothesize that this is due to both E2f1 being the most
informative of these 12 TFs (see Supplementary Material) for
predicting expression, and the majority of its binding being

indirect (Bieda et al., 2006) and thus not directly measurable
by sequence—based methods.

Replacing Sox2 in silico TFAS data with Sox2 ChIP—seq
TFAS data, however, actually decreases the fit of the regression
(Fig. law). We are unsure of why this is the case, although it
may be due to noise in the ChIP—seq dataset for Sox2.
Re—analyzing the Sox2 ChIP—seq data with more accurate
ChIP—seq peak calling algorithms may shed light on why the
in silico Sox2 TFAS appears to give an improvement in ﬁt
over the ChIP—seq Sox2 TFAS. A recent article shows that
models using this TF ChIP—seq data ﬁt expression more accur—
ately when the ChIP—seq data are re—analyzed with more accurate
peak calling algorithms (Park and Nakai, 2011).

Using PCA, we extended the study of the roles of TFs
(Ouyang et al., 2009) to also include the roles of histone modi—
ﬁcations. The results we obtain, accurately assigning (known)
roles to histone modiﬁcations, suggests that this method is of
value for exploring regulation. Applying this method to the full
set of histone modiﬁcation data from the NIH Roadmap
Epigenomics Project (Bernstein et al., 2010) would be of particu—
lar interest, especially for the examination of less well—studied
histone modiﬁcations, due to the availability of data across a
broad spectrum of tissues.

Some histone modiﬁcations, for example, H4K20me3 are
known to act combinatorially with other marks such as
H3K4me1 (Balakrishnan and Milavetz, 2010). Similarly, some
marks are mutually exclusive with other marks (e.g.
H3K27me3 and H3K27ac) (Pasini et al., 2010). These marks
have also been suggested to potentially play different regulatory
roles at different genomic loci (Kouzarides, 2007). It has been
suggested that the combination of marks around a TSS or en—
hancer form a ‘histone state’ (Ernst et al., 2011). Using the his—
tone states defined by Ernst et al. (2011) rather than raw tag
counts may prove to be more effective in our linear model at
capturing the combinatorial effects of histone modiﬁcations.

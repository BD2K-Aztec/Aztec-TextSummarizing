ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most existing methods for predicting causal disease
genes rely on specific type of evidence, and are therefore limited in
terms of applicability. More often than not, the type of evidence avail-
able for diseases varies—for example, we may know linked genes,
keywords associated with the disease obtained by mining text, or
co-occurrence of disease symptoms in patients. Similarly, the type
of evidence available for genes varies—for example, specific micro-
array probes convey information only for certain sets of genes. In this
article, we apply a novel matrix-completion method called Inductive
Matrix Completion to the problem of predicting gene-disease associa-
tions; it combines multiple types of evidence (features) for diseases
and genes to learn latent factors that explain the observed gene—dis-
ease associations. We construct features from different biological
sources such as microarray expression data and disease-related text-
ual data. A crucial advantage of the method is that it is inductive; it can
be applied to diseases not seen at training time, unlike traditional
matrix-completion approaches and network-based inference methods
that are transductive.

Results: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on diseases from
the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database shows that
the proposed approach is substantially better—it has close to one-
in-four chance of recovering a true association in the top 100 predic-
tions, compared to the recently proposed CATAPULT method (second
best) that has <15% chance. We demonstrate that the inductive
method is particularly effective for a query disease with no previously
known gene associations, and for predicting novel genes, i.e. genes
that are previously not linked to diseases. Thus the method is capable
of predicting novel genes even for well-characterized diseases. We
also validate the novelty of predictions by evaluating the method
on recently reported OMIM associations and on associations recently
reported in the literature.

1 INTRODUCTION

In silica prioritization of disease genes is an important step to-
wards discovering causal genes and understanding genetic
disorders. Many diseaseigene prioritization tools have been de-
veloped in the last decade, some generic and some disease-class
speciﬁc. Due to the inherent difﬁculty and latency in human
genewlisease studies, very few reliable associations are reported
to public databases such as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man (OMIM) and the Genetic Association Database (Becker

et al., 2004). Therefore, exploiting multiple auxiliary sources of
data is essential for predicting genes related to polygenic traits,
and many existing methods have been developed for this pur-
pose. For example, a popular family of network-based methods
include CIPHER (Wu et al., 2008), GeneWalker (Kohler et al.,
2008), Prince (V anunu et al., 2010), RWRH (Li and Patra, 2010)
and CATAPULT (Singh—Blom et al., 2013). These methods exploit
biological networks such as the functional gene interactions
network and disease similarity network; they infer genewlisease
connections by using random walk procedures on different bio-
logical networks or computing a similarity measure between
nodes.

The problem of predicting genewlisease associations can be
thought of as analogous to designing a recommender system
where the goal is to predict the ‘preference’ that a user (gene)
would give to an item (disease). An important formulation used
in recommender systems such as the Netﬁix movie recommen-
dations (Bennett and Lanning, 2007) is matrix completion, where
the problem is to ‘complete’ the user-item preference matrix
given a sample of observed preferences. The standard matrix
completion techniques for recovering the user-item preference
matrix assume that the true underlying matrix is low-rank. To
the best of our knowledge, there is no existing successful appli-
cation of the matrix completion approach to recovering the
geneidisease associations matrix. Two reasons are the extreme
sparsity of the associations matrix and the lack of ‘negative’ as-
sociations. Also, all matrix completion approaches suffer from
the cold-start problem, that of making predictions for a new user
(see Section 2). Our approach in this article is based on matrix
completion and is best motivated by the limitations of the exist-
ing methods discussed next.

Most of the aforementioned methods typically rely on a seed
or candidate set of genes already linked to the query disease and
therefore fail to make predictions for a new disease of interest,
for which there are no gene linkage studies yet; a few make rea-
sonable predictions if we could compute some similarity measure
with existing diseases on which the methods were trained.
However, more often than not, the type of evidence available
for diseases of interest variesifor example, we may know al-
ready linked genes, keywords associated with the disease ob-
tained by mining text, or co-occurrence of disease symptoms in
patients. Methods relying on a speciﬁc type of evidence (such as
disease similarities) cannot be applied to a query disease with a
different type of evidence (say keywords associated with the dis-
ease). The same is true for the type of evidence available for
genes. Network-based methods cannot predict a gene that is
not connected to any other node in the network. On the other
hand, methods that exploit gene-expression proﬁles, functional
annotations and signaling pathways exist but have primarily

been developed for speciﬁc disease-classes, and therefore fall
short in generalizing to new diseases.

It is imperative that complementary types of evidence be
merged to provide better coverage and generalization than any
single data source. The survey article by Piro and Di Cunto
(2012) discusses the following different types of evidence used
by prioritization tools: text-mining of biomedical literature,
functional annotations, pathways and ontologies, phenotype
relationships, intrinsic gene properties, sequence data, proteini
protein interactions, regulatory information, orthologous rela-
tionships and gene expression information. In this article, we
propose a framework that can seamlessly integrate features
from the aforementioned data sources. Our approach involves
two steps. First, we derive features for diseases and genes from
multiple sources. Next, we incorporate the features while trying
to learn geneidisease associations in a novel inductive matrix
completion (IMC) approach [recently developed and theoretic-
ally analyzed by Jain and Dhillon (2013)]. The entries of the
associations matrix are assumed to be generated by applying
the corresponding gene and disease feature vectors on an un-
known low-rank matrix Z. The parameter matrix Z is learnt
using a training set of OMIM geneidisease associations, and
predictions for a disease are obtained as a function of the fea-
tures of all genes and the feature vector for the disease. We
evaluate our proposed approach through comprehensive experi-
ments and demonstrate substantial increase in the quality of pre-
dictions compared to state-of—the-art methods. Our findings and
contributions are summarized below.

(1) Integrating diverse feature sets of genes and diseases ob-
tained through a wealth of publicly available data over-
comes extreme sparsity in the geneidisease associations
data.

(2) Our approach is a novel application of the inductive
matrix completion method; it can be applied to diseases
not seen at training time, unlike traditional matrix com-
pletion approaches and other network-based inference
methods that are transductive.

(3) The approach is particularly effective for a query disease
with no previously known gene associations, and for pre-
dicting novel genes, i.e. genes that are previously not
linked to diseases, thus capable of making novel predic-
tions even for well-characterized diseases.

(4) Comparison with state-of—the-art methods on OMIM
diseases shows the superiority of the inductive method.
We also validate the novelty of predictions by evaluating
the method on recently discovered gene associations re-
corded in the OMIM database, as well as on associations
recently reported in the literature curated by Bornigen
et a]. (2012).

We begin by discussing the limitations of traditional matrix
completion techniques, motivating our approach and describing
the inductive method in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe
our experimental datasets and construction of gene and disease
features. Extensive quantitative analysis of the new approach
is presented in Section 4, and conclusions are presented in
Section 5.

1.1 Related work

In the past two decades, a number of tools have been developed
for prioritizing disease genes, leveraging the advances in statis-
tical and machine learning techniques. We refer the reader to the
excellent survey articles by Moreau and Tranchevent (2012) and
by Piro and Di Cunto (2012) for a near-comprehensive treatment
of different classes of methods, contexts in which they are best-
suited and what sources of data they integrate.

Recently, predicting genewlisease links based on network ana-
lysis has become popular (Lee et al., 2011; Li and Patra, 2010;
Linghu et al., 2009; Singh—Blom et al., 2013; Vanunu et al., 2010;
Wu et al., 2008). These methods work by determining similarity
between candidate gene and disease nodes in heterogeneous net-
works composed of different biological networks [see Barabasi
et a]. (2011) for a detailed review of network-based approaches].
In particular, the recently proposed CATAPULT framework and
Katz on the heterogeneous network (Singh-Blom et al., 2013)
integrate different biological networks and phenotypes from
multiple other species such as mouse and ﬂy. The main draw-
backs of network-based methods are that they are limited to the
genes that belong to the network and often are not capable of
making predictions for new diseases. In contrast, our proposed
approach is inductive, and can integrate multiple diverse sources
of data in the form of features, including the different biological
networks.

Sequence-based features have been employed for prioritizing
disease genes by Lopez-Bigas and Ouzounis (2004) and by Adie
et a]. (2005). However, these methods do not use any prior know-
ledge about the disease and prioritize genes a priori. Miozzi et a].
(2008) show that high-throughput gene-expression data can pre-
dict gene function through the ‘guilt by association’ principle and
exploit it to find new candidate genes for many OMIM diseases.
On the other hand, methods like CATAPULT, TOPPGENE (Chen
et al., 2009) and Xu and Li (2006) use topological network fea-
tures. Our proposed approach seamlessly integrates different
types of features and therefore provides better generalization to
new diseases and new types of evidence.

2 INDUCTIVE METHOD

Our goal is to predict potential genes for a given disease of interest. We
form the gene—disease associations matrix P e [RA/“XIV”, where each row
corresponds to a gene (total number of genes is Ng), and each column
corresponds to a disease (total number of training diseases is Nd), such
that Pi) = 1 if gene i is linked to disease j and 0 if the relationship is
unobserved. Our approach is based on matrix completion, which is one
of the most successful and well-studied techniques for reoommender sys-
tems. Given a sample of observed entries Q from a true underlying matrix
M e Rm”, the goal is to estimate missing entries under additional as-
sumptions on the structure of the matrix. The most common assumption
is that the matrix is low-rank, i.e. M = WHT, where We [RNKXI‘ and
H e [RA/ix" are of rank k<< m, n. Applying the standard low-rank
model on the gene—disease associations matrix P8 WHT, we could
solve the following optimization problem:

1
min P,--—W.TH-2+7A W2+ H2, 1
W6RNRX,’HEWNWZ)EJQ(, , ,) 2 (ll HF || up) ()

where A is a regularization parameter, W,- and H) denote the latent factor
for the i-th gene and the j-th disease, respectively. We want to learn
factors W e [RA/"X" and H e [RA/ix" such that the estimated values are

Fig. 1. Low-rank modeling of genedisease associations matrix. The
shaded region in the P matrix corresponds to genes or diseases with at
least one known association. Traditional matrix completion would fail to
make predictions for genes and diseases with no known associations

close to the observed entries, and the rank of WHT is small. The gene
disease association matrix P is typically very sparse. For example, in our
dataset consisting of diseases from the OMIM database, most columns
(diseases) have just one known entry, and many rows (genes) have no
known entries. Figure 1 illustrates why using traditional matrix comple-
tion Equation (1) on P is not a good ideaiit fails to predict on rows and
columns with no known entries. Of course, to make meaningful predic-
tions, we would need more information about genes and diseases that
have no associations data.

Different data sources provide evidence for genes and diseases: text-
mining of biomedical literature, functional annotations, phenotype
relationships, proteiniprotein interactions, regulatory information,
orthologous phenotypes in other species and gene-expression informa-
tion. The question we ask here is if we can directly use the rich set of
features for genes and diseases, for the prioritization task. One naive way
is to solve a regression problem associated with each disease independ-
ently, where the gene features form the covariates and associations for the
disease are the responses. This is called single-task learning. The funda-
mental problem here is that most diseases do not have enough training
examples. In contrast, we need a multi-task learning approach, as we
would expect closely related diseases to have similar predictions. The
idea is to learn gene associations for multiple diseases jointly. We formu-
late a multi-label learning problem, where each gene is an example and
each disease is a label or a task, and the goal is to jointly learn associ-
ations for all diseases. The recently developed framework (Y u et al., 2014)
for multi-label learning formulates the problem as that of learning a low-
rank linear model Z 6 Rd“, where each example (gene) is represented by
d features and has up to L labels (diseases). If x 6 [Rd denotes the feature
vector for a gene, then the corresponding prediction for disease j is given
by xTZj, where Z) is the j-th column of Z. Two key observations given
below are in order.

(1) In typical multi-label problems arising in machine learning appli-
cations [considered, for example, by Yu et al. (2014)], the set of
labels is usually ﬁxed and when presented a new example we
would want to predict which of the labels are most relevant. In
the case of gene—disease associations, as discussed earlier, it would
be desirable to make predictions for a new diseaseifor example,
one that was not previously known to be a polygenic disorder. But
this is not possible in the standard multi-label formulation because
it is transductiveithe labels are ﬁxed during the training phase,
and predictions on new labels are not possible.

(2) On the other hand, it would be helpful to construct features from
other auxiliary sources such as text articles on diseases, studies on
patients, symptoms, etc. Relationships (such as co-occurrences)
with other existing polygenic traits also make viable biological
features. We would want to be able to exploit available informa-
tion to make informed predictions on diseases.

To this end, we adopt the recently developed IMC method (Jain and
Dhillon, 2013) for the task of learning genHisease associations.
The method can be interpreted as a generalization of the transductive

multi-label learning formulation. IMC assumes that the associations
matrix is generated by applying feature vectors associated with its row
as well as column entities to a low-rank matrix Z. The goal is to recover
Z using observations from P. The idea is illustrated in Figure 2.

Let x,- e [R45 denote the feature vector for gene i, and yj e W” denote
the feature vector for disease j. Let X e [RA/"X1!" denote the training feature
matrix of Ng genes, where the i-th row is the gene feature vector x,, and let
Y e [RA/“f” denote the training feature matrix of N d diseases, where the i-
th row is the disease feature vector yi. The IMC problem is to recover a
low-rank matrix Z 6 WIN!” using the observed entries from the gene
disease association matrix P. Denote the set of observed entries (i.e.
training gene—disease associations) by Q. The entry P1) of the matrix is
modeled as P,-j=x,.TZyj and the goal is to learn Z using the observed
entries £2. Z is of the form Z = WHT, where W e WKXI‘ and
H 6 WW", and k is small. The low-rank constraint on Z is NP-hard to
solve. The standard relaxation of the rank constraint is the trace norm,
i.e. sum of singular values. Minimizing the trace-norm of Z = WHT is
equivalent to minimizing %(||W||%+ ||H||%). The factors W and H are
obtained as solutions to the following optimization problem:

A
' KP," TWHT.+7 W2+H2. 2
Went/xiiiﬁemxkﬁgg ( ,,x, y,) 2(ii HF || HF) ()

The loss function Z penalizes the deviation of estimated entries from the
observations. A common choice for loss function is the squared loss
function given by (3,101, b)=(a — b)2. The regularization parameter A
trades off accrued losses on observed entries and the trace-norm con-
straint. Given a new disease j’ that was not a part of the training data,
the predictions P,-// can be computed for all genes i as long as we have
feature vector yji. Typically, when the number of features is very large, a
small value of k implies that the number of parameters to be learnt is
much smaller than fg xfd. Note that in the standard matrix completion,
we would learn (Ng + Nd) xk parameters, but in IMC the number of
parameters is independent of the number of genes or diseases, but de-
pends only on the number of gene and disease features.

2.1 Principal components as features

We perform dimensionality reduction on different types of data sources
to obtain robust gene and disease features. Most of our data sources are
in the form of networks represented by adjacency matrices. One way to
obtain real-valued features for nodes is to look at the principal compo-
nents of the adjacency matrices. In particular, we use the leading eigen-
vectors of the adjacency matrix as latent features. For example, consider
the gene-interactions network G of size Ng x Ng. Let U e [RA/Mm denote
the matrix of eigenvectors corresponding to the top m eigenvalues of G.
Now, the i-th row of U gives m latent features for gene i. We perform
PCA (principal components analysis) on the microarray expression and
word-count data to obtain low-dimensional informative features for
genes and diseases, respectively. We discuss data sources and feature ex-
traction in detail in Section 3.

2.2 Optimization

The objective function in Equation (2) is non-convex. We adapt the
LEML solver provided by Yu et al. (2014) for solving Equation (2)
since the traditional multi-label learning problem can be thought of a
special case of Equation (2) where the disease feature matrix Y is set to
the identity matrix of size Nd. The solver uses alternating minimization
(ﬁx Wand solve for H and vice versa) to optimize Equation (2). If the loss
function Z is convex, then the objective function becomes convex when W
or H is ﬁxed. The resulting convex problem in one variable (W or H) is
solved using the Conjugate Gradient iterative procedure. Common
choices of loss function include squared loss, logistic loss Z10g(a,b)=log
(1 + e’“”) and squared-hinge loss (sqhingcw, b) = (max (0, 1 — ab))2. Note

Fig. 2. Schematic of the proposed approach. First, we construct gene and disease features using different sources. Then, we perform IMC using row and
column features. The shaded region in the P matrix corresponds to genes or diseases with at least one known association

that the set £2 contains only positive (known gene—disease) associations.
However, the number of positive associations typically is very small.
In many machine-learning applications, we also have access to negative
examples. Unfortunately, we do not have any negative examples (i.e.
absence of a gene—disease connection) for our task. Common strategies
to cope with the situation are treating all unknowns as negative associ-
ations, randomly sampling negative associations from unknowns, or
using label-dependent costs (Kshirsagar et al., 2013; Natarajan et al.,
2013; Singh-Blom et al., 2013).

2.3 Computational efﬁciency

Computational cost of solving the optimization problem potentially dif-
fers with the choice of the loss function. In our experiments, we use
squared loss in the objective, and treat missing values as zeros. For
squared loss with fully observed labels, we can essentially use the
Algorithm 2 in Yu et al. (2014), which yields a fast procedure for solving
Equation (2). In particular, the time taken per alternating minimization
step is O((nnz(P)-i-Ngfg +Ndfd)k2T), where nnz(P) denotes the number
of non-zeros in P, and Tis a small constant. In our experiments, fd, fg and
k are very small (few hundreds), and the alternating minimization
procedure converges in <10 iterations (takes under 2min on average on
a 2.8 GHz, 8-core machine).

3 DATASET AND FEATURES
3.1 OMIM associations

We obtained human geneidisease associations data from the
OMIM project. OMIM phenotypes have become the standard
data set for the evaluation of prediction of genewlisease associ-
ations (Karni et al., 2009; Kohler et al. 2008; Li and Patra, 2010;
Mordelet and Vert, 2011; Singh-Blom et al., 2013; Vanunu et al.,
2010; Wu et al., 2008). For quantitative evaluation (using 3-fold
cross-validation discussed in Section 4.1), we use the OMIM data
used in Singh-Blom et al. (2013). There are 3209 diseases with at
least one known gene association and 3954 genewlisease associ-
ations (i.e. the total number of non-zeros in the geneidisease
associations matrix). The matrix is extremely sparse, with
>90% of the columns with exactly one non-zero entry and
~75% of the rows with no non-zero entries. To compare differ-
ent gene prioritization methods on the novelty of predictions

(see Section 4.7), we use more recently reported associations in
the OMIM database (reported between August 2011 and
November 2013).

3.2 Gene features

Microarray measurements of gene-expression levels in different
tissue samples, obtained from BioGPS (www.biogps.org) and
Connectivity Map (www.broadinstitute.org/cmap), serve as the
ﬁrst source of the gene features. In particular, each feature cor-
responds to a gene-expression level in a sample of a given cell
type. Typically, microarray measurements are given for ‘probes’
(that encode possibly multiple genes). If a probe involves more
than a single gene, then the probe is discardedithus favoring
gene-speciﬁc probes. If a gene is part of many such probes, then
the measurements are averaged across probes. There are some
genes for which we do not have any measurements, and hence no
features are available for those genes. In total, there are 4536
features for each of the 8755 genes. We observe that the features
are highly correlated. This is understandable as samples of same
cell type from two different individuals (as in the case of BioGPS
features) tend to have similar gene-expression proﬁles. In our
experiments, we project the data to a lower dimensional space.
In particular, we use PCA that performs a linear mapping of the
data onto the lower dimensional space spanned by the leading
100 eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, maximizing the vari-
ance of the data in the new representation.

The second source of gene features is the functional interaction
data between genes. HumanNet (Lee et al., 2011) is a large-scale
functional gene network which incorporates multiple datasets,
including mRNA expression, proteiniprotein interactions, pro-
tein complex data and comparative genomics (but not disease or
phenotype data). HumanNet contains 21 different data sources,
which are combined into one integrated network using a regu-
larized regression scheme trained on GO pathways. HumanNet
has been shown to be very useful for the gene-prioritization task
(Singh-Blom et al., 2013). We obtain latent graph features for
genes from HumanNet given by the leading 100 eigenvectors of
the network.

The third source of gene features arises from gene orthologyi
geneiphenotype associations of other species that are relatively
richer compared to genewlisease studies in humans. We use
phenotypes of eight different species (Singh-Blom et al., 2013),
namely, plant [Arabidopsis thaliana, from TAIR Swarbreck et al.
(2008)], worm [Caenorhabditis elegans from WormBase Chen et al.
(2005) and Green et al. (2011)], fruit ﬂy [Drosophila melanogaster
from FlyBase Tweedie et al. (2009)], mouse [Mus musculus from
MGD Eppig et al. (2007)], yeast [Saccharomyces cerevisiae from
Dwight et al. (2002), Saito et al. (2004), McGary et al. (2007) and
Hillenmeyer et al. (2008)] Escherichia coli [Nichols et al. (2011)],
zebraﬁsh [Danio rerio from ZFIN Sprague et al. (2006)] and
chicken [Gallus gallus from GEISHA Bell et al. (2004)]. We
form a large geneiphenotype associations matrix (similar to the
genewlisease associations matrix), whose columns correspond to
phenotypes of the aforementioned organisms. We use the leading
100 singular vectors of the matrix as features for genes.

3.3 Disease features

Analogous to the use of HumanNet for obtaining latent features
for genes, we extract 100 latent disease features from the disease
similarity network MimMiner (Van Driel et al., 2006). The
MimMiner network has been previously used for prioritizing
disease genes (Li and Patra, 2010; Singh-Blom et al., 2013;
Vanunu et al., 2010). Another source of disease features we in-
corporate comes from the web pages for the OMIM diseases. In
particular, we look at the ‘Clinical Features’ and ‘Clinical
Management’ sections of the web pages that document the symp-
toms, medication and responses by patients, and related studies
of effects of different courses of therapies. We want a represen-
tation for diseases such that two diseases that are biologically
close (such as variants of the same disease) are also close in the
feature space. To this end, we form the so-called term-document
matrix M, where M ,1- gives the frequency of the term i in the web
page corresponding to disease j. The term-document matrix is
commonly used in text mining such as topic extraction from a
corpus of documents. Often it is better to use a re-weighting
scheme called tfiidf (term frequencyiinverse document fre-
quency): Mi]- is offset by the frequency of the word i in the
entire collection of documents. This helps ﬁltering out common
words. After applying the tfiidf scheme, we trim the feature
space by purging the most common (like ‘dose’, ‘day’, ‘regimen’
that are not informative) and very rare words (specific to a dis-
ease such as ‘vicriviroc’ that appears only in the OMIM page for
Susceptibility to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I pheno-
type). The resulting feature space for diseases is still high dimen-
sional (~20 000 words). We reduce the dimensionality of
the feature space using PCA as in the case of microarray gene
features, retaining the top 100 principal components.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Evaluation methods

To quantitatively evaluate our approach and to compare to the
state-of—the—art diseaseigene-prioritization methods, we measure
the recovery of genes using a cross-validation strategy similar to
the one used by Mordelet and Vert (2011) and by Singh-Blom
et al. (2013) on OMIM data. We split the known genewlisease

pairs into three equally sized groups. We hide the associations in
one group and run the methods on the remaining associations,
repeating three times to ensure that each group is hidden exactly
once. For each disease in our dataset, we order all the genes by
how strongly the method predicts them to be associated with the
disease. Finally, for every geneidisease pair (g, d) in the hidden
group we record the rank of the gene g in the list associated with
disease d. We use the cumulative distribution of the ranks as a
measure for comparing the performances of different methods,
i.e. the probability that the rank (at which hidden genewlisease
pair is retrieved) is less than a threshold r. The motivation for
using this performance measure is to distinguish methods based
on the probability of recovering a true association in the top-r
predictions for a given disease. A small value of r is desired by
biologists; Here, we report results for r5 100. Recent methods
including ProDiGe (Mordelet and Vert, 2011) and CATAPULT
(Singh-Blom et al., 2013) have adopted this performance meas-
ure for evaluation.

We are also interested in studying the ability of our method to
correctly identify associations between diseases and genes that are
less well studied. Singh-Blom et al. (2013) propose validation on
singleton genes, i.e. genes with only one known association in the
dataset but none in the training, for highlighting methods that
discover novel genes. We employ this validation strategy in
Section 4.5. In Section 4.6, we study how different methods per-
form on the task of predicting genes for a new disease, i.e. diseases
for which there are no known associations at the training time.

Assessing the novelty of predictions is often challenging. It is
common to hand-pick biologically relevant genes from the top
few predictions and corroborate with findings in the existing lit-
erature, which is then sometimes followed by wet-lab experi-
ments. Here, we choose to use the unbiased evaluation scheme
adopted by Bornigen et al. (2012) for assessing the novelty of
gene-prioritization methods. In particular, we train all the com-
petitive methods using all the available OMIM data collected
until August 2011. Then, we evaluate the methods on the asso-
ciations recently reported in the literature, collected by Bornigen
et al. (2012), and the associations recorded in the OMIM data-
base between August 2011 and November 2013 (Section 4.7).

4.2 Baselines and competitive methods

A natural baseline for our proposed approach is the standard
matrix completion on the genewlisease associations matrix P
given in Equation (1), i.e. IMC with the gene feature matrix X
and the disease feature matrix Y set to identity matrices of appro-
priate sizes. We compare to two recently proposed methods that
rely on combining the different biological networks we use to
derive latent features from: the gene-interactions network, the dis-
ease similarity network and the bipartite geneiphenotype associ-
ations networks of multiple species. We also consider a stronger
baseline methodimatrix completion on a heterogeneous network
that is composed of the aforementioned biological networks.
Finally, we compare to the LEML method H u et al., 2014),
which is the transductive equivalent of IMC, when there are no
disease features. Below, we describe the methods in more detail:

1. CATAPULT (Singh-Blom et al., 2013): Train a bagging sup-
port vector machine classiﬁer over geneidisease pairs;

Inductive Matrix Completion

 

each genewlisease pair is represented by features corres-
ponding to the number of paths of increasing lengths in
the combined network given by:

C2 G 13 (3)
PTQ’

where P includes the geneidisease associations matrix P
and phenotypes of other species discussed in Section 3.2,
and Q is set to the disease similarity matrix Q corres-
ponding to human disease nodes and 0 elsewhere. This
method was shown to outperform a number of graph-
based inference methods such as PRINCE (V anunu et al.,
2010), RWRH (Li and Patra, 2010) and ProDiGe
(Mordelet and Vert, 2011).

. Katz on the combined network (Singh-Blom et al., 2013):
The method computes similarities between a pair of
nodes based on how many paths of different lengths con-
nect the pair. The similarity between nodes i and j in the
combined network Equation (3) is given by:

k
SKalZ(C)ij = Z ’31 (C1)”,
l=l

where Cg]. gives the number of paths of length I connect-
ing nodes i and j in the network C. Typically, a small
value of k is used (node similarity is better captured by
shorter paths). Letting k = 3, we can write the matrix of
scores between gene and disease nodes as:

$5?” = ﬂP + 132 (GP + PQ)

+ 133(PPTP+ 0213+ GPQ +PQ2).

The parameter )3 (typically set to a small value like 0.01)
dampens the contribution from paths of higher lengths.
This method is closely related to RWRH (Li and Patra,
2010).

. Matrix completion on the combined network: We con-
sider matrix completion on the combined network C in-
stead of the bipartite network P; the low-rank model
C B WHT suggests that the factors W and H should ex-
plain not only the genewlisease associations, but also the
observed gene interactions, other species phenotypes and
disease similarities. Letting the size of the matrix C to be
N x N, the optimization problem we solve is:

min (Ci- — W-THJ-ﬂa (Ci- — W-THJ-r
WHEN” age l (131;!) l

+)~(||W||%+ ||H||%)-

A large value of a biases the estimation of the unobserved
entries in the different biological networks comprising C
toward 0 (reﬂecting the assumption that the true under-
lying biological networks are sparse). Of course, setting
a = 0 corresponds to applying the standard matrix com-
pletion Equation (1) on C. In our experiments, we set
a = 0.2 (the best value chosen by cross-validation).

4. LEML (Yu et al., 2014) Implemented identical to IMC,
but does not use disease features.

Note that the ﬁrst three methods do not use gene— or disease-
speciﬁc features such as microarray or tfiidf, respectively. For all
the matrix-completion—based methods (including LEML and
IMC), we rank the predictions using the estimated values of
the matrix (higher the estimated value Pi], more relevant is the
gene i for disease j). For the IMC method (i) we construct the
gene and disease features (fg = 300, fd = 200) as described in
Section 3, (ii) we use squared loss in the optimization problem
Equation (2), which we ﬁnd to be the best-performing loss func-
tion in our experiments, and missing entries are treated as zeros
in the objective function, which together with squared loss results
in a fast procedure for solving Equation (2) as discussed in
Section 2.3. We set A = 0.2 in the optimization problem
Equation (2) for both IMC and LEML. We use the best value
for parameters obtained by cross-validation for all the competi-
tive methods.

4.3 Overall performance

The 3-fold cross-validation results on 3209 OMIM diseases are
presented in Figure 3a. The vertical axis in the plots gives the
probability that a true gene association is recovered in the top-r
predictions for various r values in the horizontal axis. We ob-
serve that the proposed method IMC signiﬁcantly dominates
every other competitive method consistently over all r values.
Our method has close to 25% chance of retrieving a true gene
in the top-100 predictions for a disease, whereas even the second
best performing method CATAPULT has only ~15%. The three
competitive methods Katz, CATAPULT and matrix completion on
the combined network which use the same information, albeit in
different ways, perform very similarly within the top-100 predic-
tions. As expected, matrix completion on C performs signiﬁ-
cantly better than the baseline matrix completion. The
importance of using disease features cannot be emphasized
moreiLEML performs signiﬁcantly worse. In Figure 3b, we
present precisionirecall curves for different methods. Precision
is the fraction of true positives (genes) recovered in the top-r
predictions for a disease. Recall is the ratio of true positives re-
covered in the top-r predictions to the total number of true posi-
tives for the disease in the test set. We observe a consistent
ordering of curves with respect to the standard precision and
recall measures.

Integration of multiple informative features is important for
the success of the method. However, we do see that disease fea-
tures play a dominant role in the predictive power, as most of the
OMIM diseases have a single known gene. We find that (data
not shown in plots) features obtained from gene-interactions
network are important particularly for genes that are well-
connected. Gene-expression data is highly noisy and correlated,
and therefore we rely on using a few PCA features. Not all genes
and diseases have all sets of features; genes that are not con-
nected in the gene network have some microarray expression
based features, and similarly diseases not connected in the disease
similarity network have tfiidf features. We would like to empha-
size that integrating features from different sources that bring

shows the empirical cumulative distribution function for the rank of the
withheld gene under cross validation. The vertical axis shows the probabil-
ity that a true gene association is retrieved in the top-r (shown on the
horizontal axis) predictions for a disease. The proposed method IMC is
trained with 300 gene features, 200 disease features and k = 200. Katz,
CATAPULT and Matrix completion on C all use the same combined
network Equation (3). IMC (solid black) consistently and signiﬁcantly out-
performs competitive methods by a large margin. The signiﬁcance of using
disease features is apparent by comparing to LEML (dash-dotted blue)

in complementary information, helps improve the predictive
performance.

4.4 Effect of rank k

The key parameter in IMC is k, the rank of the model matrix
Z 6 Rmxm. The effect of rank k on the performance of the
method is shown in Figure 4. In general, we observe that per-
formance increases with k. More importantly, a small rank
k = 30 yields a competitive performanceimuch better than
CATAPULT as compared with Figure 3a. This indicates the success

Fig. 4. Performance of IMC (fg = 300, fd = 200) for different values of k.
The performance increases with the rank k of the parameter matrix Z.
Even when k = 30, IMC starts performing much better than the com-
petitive methods [compare with Figure 3a]. Curves for k = 100 and
k = 200 almost coincide

of multi-task learning approach that exploits correlations be-
tween multiple diseases and between multiple genes.
At k = 100 IMC performs as good as the effective full rank
k = 200. For comparison with competitive methods, we use
k = 200 in our experiments.

4.5 Singleton genes

One problem that plagues the evaluation of prioritization meth-
ods are the ‘popular’ genes. Genes that are well-connected tend
to be predicted more often and therefore tend to yield inﬂated
recall rates. To this end, we adopt the following strategy used in
Singh—Blom et al. (2013): We look at singleton genes, i.e. genes
that have only one association in the data, and evaluate the
methods on how highly the corresponding gene associations
are ranked. Note that the genes have no known associations at
training time, and therefore the ability of a method to predict
singleton gene associations also attests to the novelty of predic-
tions. The results are shown in Figure 5a. We see that using
additional sources like the biological networks directly are help-
ful in the case of Katz and matrix completion on C and to lesser
extent in case of CATAPULT in the top 1720. IMC attains a sig-
niﬁcant increase in the performance around top 5&100 predic-
tions because it uses additional microarray features.

4.6 Induction on new diseases

Next, we turn to an important aspect of evaluation of the pro-
posed methodiability to make predictions for a new disease. By
new disease, we mean a disease for which there are no existing
gene associations. However, the features for the new disease may
be available. For evaluation purposes, we look at the CDF of
ranks of genes associated to diseases for which no gene associ-
ations were available at the training time (corresponding to col-
umns with no known entries). Figure 5b shows how different
methods perform on the task. The signiﬁcance of using disease
features cannot be emphasized moreiIMC is substantially
better than all other methods. Note that the baseline matrix
completion is missing from the plot, as it cannot make predic-
tions for diseases with no known entries.

Fig. 5. Evaluating novelty with singleton genes and induction on new
diseases. The methods are evaluated in two extreme settings: rows with
no known entries (top panel) and columns with no known entries (bottom
panel). (A) While using additional sources like the biological networks
directly are helpful in the case of Katz and Matrix completion on C, we
see a signiﬁcant increase in the performance around top 5(F100 predic-
tions by also using microarray features (solid black). (B) The signiﬁcance
of using disease features is distinct. Note that the baseline matrix com-
pletion is missing from both the panels as it cannot make predictions for
rows or columns with no known entries (see Section 2)

4.7 Evaluation on newly discovered associations

Bornigen et al. (2012) evaluate gene prioritization tools using 42
then recently reported associations. The evaluation is unbiased in
the following sense: cross-validation on retrospective data is
likely to yield overoptimistic performance estimate, as some of
the data sources are contaminated with knowledge from genei
disease associations. It is important to understand the subtlety
hereithe contamination can be by more indirect ways. For
example, certain gene interactions may have been discovered

Fig. 6. Evaluating methods on 120 newly discovered associations. The
plot shows empirical cumulative distribution function of the ranks of
recently discovered associations for a few diseases (see Section 4.7). We
see that IMC outperforms all the methods for most values of r, and
CATAPULT is competitive. Note that the training data consists of many
more associations than that of Figure 3, and partly explains the notice-
able increase in performance of all methods

precisely because of the associations with the particular disease
under evaluation. Though the associations themselves are
hidden, the other features are ‘contaminated’ with this informa-
tion. The approach therefore mimics novel discovery more
closely.

We train all the methods using all gene associations for 3209
OMIM diseases collected until August 2011. For evaluation, we
use 36 of the 42 associations curated by Bornigen et al. (2012)
(we use the expanded set of OMIM phenotypes in our experi-
ments; six of the 42 associations correspond to collapsed pheno-
types such as ‘Complex heart defect’ which can potentially be
associated with many phenotypes in our dataset, and therefore
we choose to exclude them from evaluation). Of the 36 associ-
ations, six associations correspond to six new diseases that are
not a part of our training data. It has been a year since the paper
was published, so we supplement the data by including 84 recent
associations added to the OMIM database between August 2011
and November 2013. The total 120 associations involve 115
unique genes, of which 56 genes did not have any known asso-
ciations before. Thus, evaluation on the new associations also
helps characterize the ability of the methods to recommend novel
genes. The ranking performances of competitive methods on the
120 new associations are shown in Figure 6. We see that IMC
outperforms all the methods for most values of r and CATAPULT
is competitive. We observe a noticeable increase in performance
of all methods compared to the cross-validation results in
Figure 3. Note that the training data for this experiment consists
of many more associations than previous experiments, and in
particular all the diseases [except six new diseases from
Bornigen et al. (2012)] have at least one known association.

Gene MUTYH for Gastric Cancer: As a concrete example,
consider the case of the OMIM disease Gastric Cancer. We

observe that our method recovers the hidden gene MUTYH in
the top-100 predictions but no other method does. Notably,
MUTYH is also associated with the OMIM phenotype
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis 2. The tfiidf features for the
two diseases have a high similarity (normalized inner product)
which helps our method recover MUTYH for gastric cancer.

5 CONCLU$ONS

In this article, we have proposed a novel approach based on
inductive matrix completion for prioritizing disease genes.
Our approach combines complementary types of evidence
which is essential for generalizing to new diseases, as no single
source of data can potentially capture all relevant relations.
Comprehensive quantitative analysis of the proposed approach
substantiates the claim, as we observe that approaches that rely
on particular sources or features (such as biological networks in
case of CATAPULT or only gene features as in the case of LEML)
perform signiﬁcantly worse in many cases. The inductive method
is not restricted to the types of features used in our experi-
mentsinew sources of information can be incorporated easily.
Typically, prioritization strategies for ﬁnding a novel gene
related to an already well-characterized disease would differ
from those for which limited or no prior knowledge is available.
In our experiments, we ﬁnd that our approach consistently per-
forms the best on almost all types of diseases and genes, well-
characterized or new, which makes our approach a suitable
prioritization tool to use for biologists.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Comparing 3D structures of homologous RNA
molecules yields information about sequence and structural
variability. To compare large RNA 3D structures, accurate automatic
comparison tools are needed. In this article, we introduce a
new algorithm and web server to align large homologous RNA
structures nucleotide by nucleotide using local superpositions that
accommodate the flexibility of RNA molecules. Local alignments
are merged to form a global alignment by employing a maximum
clique algorithm on a specially defined graph that we call the ‘local
alignment’ graph.

Results: The algorithm is implemented in a program suite and web
server called ‘R3D Align’. The R3D Align alignment of homologous 3D
structures of 58, 168 and 238 rRNA was compared to a high-quality
hand alignment. A full comparison of the 16S alignment with the other
state-of-the-art methods is also provided. The R3D Align program
suite includes new diagnostic tools for the structural evaluation
of RNA alignments. The R3D Align alignments were compared to
those produced by other programs and were found to be the most
accurate, in comparison with a high quality hand-crafted alignment
and in conjunction with a series of other diagnostics presented. The
number of aligned base pairs as well as measures of geometric
similarity are used to evaluate the accuracy of the alignments.
Availability: R3D Align is freely available through a web server
http://rna.bgsu.edu/RSDAIign. The MATLAB source code of the
program suite is also freely available for download at that location.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alignments of homologous RNA sequences can provide great insight
into the structures, functions and evolutionary histories of RNA
molecules. As is the case for proteins, alignment procedures based
solely on sequence similarity will also correctly align secondary
structure features of RNA, when sequence similarity is high. But
such methods are inadequate for RNA homologs that have diverged
signiﬁcantly in sequence, and alignment methods that take into

account Watson—Crick base-pair co-variation are needed to obtain
accurate alignments that reﬂect the conserved secondary structure.
Homologous RNA molecules share a core conserved secondary
structure and 3D structure. As more 3D structures of RNA homologs
appear, robust methods for simultaneous alignment at multiple
structural levels, sequence, secondary structure and 3D structure
are needed that can reveal the common structural features. This
knowledge, extracted from the extant 3D database, can in turn
guide efforts aimed at efﬁciently aligning the exponentially growing
number of homologs known only from sequence (Brown et al.,
2009). For example, although only a handful of atomic-resolution
3D structures of ribosomal RNAs are known, hundreds of thousands
of homologs have been sequenced.

We have 3D structures of three bacterial and one archaeal 23S
rRNAs, the bacteria Thermus thermophilus (Tilt), Escherichia coli
(E. coli) and Deinococcus radiodurans (D.r.) and the archaeon H.m.
In previous work, we produced hand-crafted alignments of these
structures, a non-trivial task for which no software existed at the
time (Stombaugh et al., 2009). Because producing a hand-crafted
alignment is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, and in
light of the rapid increase in 3D RNA structures in the PDB/NDB
(Berman et (11., 2002), we were motivated to develop automated
tools to align RNA 3D structures in a robust manner. This article
reports a successful effort to do so.

For the purposes of this article, an alignment of two RNA
structures is a list of correspondences between individual nucleotides
from the two RNAs. In every alignment, we require that the
correspondences be well-ordered (if nucleotides i and j are aligned
with nucleotides i’ and j’ , respectively, then i < j if and only if i’ <j’)
and uniquely assigned (no nucleotide should be aligned to more than
one nucleotide from the other RNA).

A number of research groups have developed programs for
aligning RNA 3D structures, and we brieﬂy review previous work
in this section.

DIAL (Ferre et al., 2007) aligns RNA 3D structures using a
quadratic time dynamic programming algorithm that includes terms
for similarity in nucleotide sequence, base pairing and nine torsional
angles used to describe the RNA backbone. The nine torsional
angles include six dihedral angles (or, £3, y, 6, e, g“) used to deﬁne RNA
backbone conformations and the dihedral angle (x) that describes
rotation about the glycosidic bond (Hershkovitz et (11., 2003). It also
uses two additional virtual angles 17 and 6, introduced in (Olson,
1975) and reintroduced in (Duarte et al., 2003).

SARA (Capriotti and Marti-Renom, 2008) performs pairwise
RNA 3D-to-3D alignment by implementing a unit-vector

representation of RNA structures that calculates a set of vectors
between consecutive atoms. Quadratic-time dynamic programming
algorithms are then applied to the reduced unit-vector representation
of the structure. The SARA algorithm was inspired by the
MAMMOTH program for protein structure alignment (Ortiz et al.,
2002).

SARSA (Chang et al., 2008) is a web tool that can be used to
align two RNA structures using the PARTS application. PARTS
reduces the 3D structure into a 1D sequence of letters selected
from an RNA structural alphabet of 23 letters that represent distinct
and common backbone conformations. Quadratic-time dynamic
programming sequence alignment methods are then employed on
these 1D encoded sequences.

Thus, the approach used by DIAL, SARA, and PARTS for
constructing a 3D-to-3D alignment of RNA is to extract particular
classes of information from the 3D structure, create a reduced,
essentially linear, representation of the RNA structure, and then
utilize a quadratic-time sequence alignment algorithm on the
reduced representation. While these programs are certainly useﬁil
because they are able to produce alignments quickly, it has been
noted that due to the complexity of RNA 3D structural alignment,
one cannot rely on a quadratic time algorithm to be highly accurate
(Ferre et al., 2007).

ARTS (Dror et al., 2005) represents each nucleotide by the
position of the phosphorus atom in the backbone. ARTS seeks
the single rigid transformation that maximizes a weighted scoring
ﬁinction based on both the number of corresponding nucleotides and
base pairs. This method can be used to discover previously unknown
common substructures. ARTS is not constrained to produce well-
ordered alignments, enabling non-sequential common substructures
to be discovered. ARTS is a heuristic algorithm of complexity
0(n3).

In this article, we introduce a new methodology for alignment of
RNA 3D structures and a web server, and program that implements
this methodology. We call this program R3D Align, which stands for
‘RNA 3D Alignment’ . A notable feature of R3D Align is that it is able
to accommodate the ﬂexibility that exists among RNA 3D structures.
ARTS is not designed to align large, conformationally ﬂexible
RNA 3D structures because it uses a single rigid transformation
to ﬁnd corresponding nucleotides. Thus, ARTS typically leaves
entire regions unaligned, even though the regions themselves may
superpose very well locally. This will be illustrated in the Section 3.

R3D Align accommodates local conformational ﬂexibility by
using many superpositions of local neighborhoods rather than a
single global superposition. The local neighborhoods are formed
so as to take into account pairwise nucleotide interactions of all
types, including non-Watson—Crick as well as Watson—Crick base
pairs. In addition to local base pair interactions, the program
considers long-range (tertiary) base pair and base-stacking contacts.
Although we account for and use all local and long-range pairwise
interactions, we work directly with the geometry of the 3D structures
in order to maintain independence from any particular program for
annotating base interactions since any such classiﬁcation necessarily
creates a dichotomy in which some interactions fall just beyond the
classiﬁcation cutoff.

R3D Align is intended for use where nucleotide to nucleotide
alignments are meaninng, for instance, for aligning homologous
molecules. In this respect, it differs from ARTS, which is primarily
intended to ﬁnd common substructures using a single rigid

superposition of two structures. While R3D Align and ARTS can
sometimes both be used in a meaningful way on the same structures,
they are in fact complementary programs.

R3D Align has been designed to produce highly accurate
alignments of homologous molecules. While the tradeoff of
achieving more accurate alignments at the expense of greater
computational costs is difﬁcult to avoid, R3D Align employs several
techniques to maintain computational feasibility (see Section 2). In
fact, R3D Align can be used to accurately align very large RNA 3D
structures, such as 23S rRNA, in a reasonable length of time (see
Supplementary Material S4 and S5).

As noted in Ferre et al. (2007), a primary application of faster
running quadratic-time algorithms may be to identify potential
alignment regions which can then be processed by a more accurate,
but computationally intensive, RNA structural alignment algorithm.
R3D Align has the capability to fulﬁll this need (see Section 2).

The classical tool for 3D-to-3D alignment evaluation has been
the average root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) after optimal
superimposition of the atomic coordinates of the set of aligned
nucleotides in each structure. While the RMSD does reveal
information about the global structure of the aligned nucleotides,
local neighborhoods may actually differ quite substantially, as the
RMSD spreads errors over the whole structure. Using the global
RMSD alone, it is difﬁcult to analyze whether speciﬁc local regions
are aligned sufﬁciently well or not. Also, the RMSD is not designed
to give detailed information about the conservation of interactions
among nucleotides between the two structures, whether they are
local or long-range interactions.

These issues were recognized in Parisien et al. (2009), who
introduced new tools based on speciﬁc RNA structural features
rather than on global average measurements were introduced. These
tools evaluate different modeling techniques and are useful for
comparing a modeled structure with an experimentally resolved
structure. Because R3D Align is used to align structures of different
organisms, we introduce diagnostics to aid in structure comparison
and alignment evaluation when the alignment is non-trivial (see
Section 3).

In the following section, we present the algorithm upon which
R3D Align is built and outline the implementation in the R3D Align
web server and MATLAB program suite.

2 METHODS

2.1 Transformation into a maximum clique problem

Our objective is to produce the most complete global alignment of
two homologous. structurally similar RNA 3D structures in which local
neighborhoods locally superimpose well in 3D space. We meet this objective
by ﬁnding the maximum clique of a specially deﬁned graph.

We assemble a set NA of 4-nt neighborhoods from structure A in such a
way that each nucleotide is a member of p neighborhoods. where p is an
integer speciﬁed ahead of time by the user. The 4m in each neighborhood
are listed in ascending order with respect to the 5’-end. The diameter of a
neighborhood is the maximum distance between the geometric centers of the
bases as previously described (Sarver at al.. 2008). For each nucleotide i in A.
we ﬁnd the p neighborhoods of smallest diameter which include nucleotide
i and add them to the set NA. Most neighborhoods will be added more than
once. but we do not keep duplicates in the set NA. The 4-nt neighborhoods
of small diameter will contain most pairwise interactions (e.g. base pairing.

the sequence or secondary structure. For larger values of p. more of the local

Fig. 1. Illustration of compatibility of alignments. Each vertex represents a
four-nucleotide alignment. as in Alignment 1. Alignment 2 and Alignment 3
above. An alignment formed by merging Alignments l and 3 is neither
a uniquely assigned nor a well-ordered alignment. while the merging of
Alignments 2 and 3 violates the uniquely assigned criterion. Only alignments
l and 2 can be merged to form a valid alignment. namely the aligning of
nucleotides 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8 in the ﬁrst structure with nucleotidesl. 2. 3.

vicinity of each nucleotide will be represented in NA. The total number of
neighborhoods of a molecule with n nucleotides is bounded by p X n. and so
is of complexity 0(a).

Given a second structure B that we wish to align with structure A. we
construct in the same way its list of 4-nt neighborhoods. NB. We then
compare the neighborhoods of NA and NB to determine which neighborhoods
are structurally similar. We ﬁnd that the geometric discrepancy (measured
in Angstroms) that was developed in (Sarver et al.. 2008) is suitable
for determining the structural similarity between 4-nt neighborhoods.
The geometric discrepancy is similar to RMSD. but accounts for base
substitutions between the two structures in a consistent way. For each
local neighborhood in NA. we calculate the geometric discrepancy with
every local neighborhood in NB. and organize these discrepancy values
into an m X n array. with m: |NA| and n: |NB | being the number of
4-nucleotide neighborhoods from each structure. respectively. Each entry of
the array represents a possible pairing of one neighborhood from A and one
neighborhood from B. Two neighborhoods are classiﬁed as being structurally
similar if their geometric discrepancy is less than a pre-deﬁned discrepancy
cutoff parameter a’.

We seek the alignment of structure A and structure B that aligns the largest
number of structurally similar local neighborhoods. Finding the optimal
alignment can be reduced to ﬁnding the maximum clique of a specially
deﬁned graph. which we call the ‘local alignment” graph.

The construction and use of the local alignment graph is now explained
in detail. Using the m X n array described above. we generate a vertex for
the local alignment graph for each entry in the array that has geometric
discrepancy less than the cutoff (1. Because we have put the nucleotides
in each neighborhood in 5’ to 3’ order. each vertex represents a uniquely
assigned and well-ordered alignment of structurally similar neighborhoods
from A and B. Each of these alignments has only 4 nt correspondences. but
we can merge together many such local alignments to form a larger alignment
of A and B. However. not all of these 4-nt alignments are compatible; some
would lead to an alignment which either violates the well-ordered or uniquely
assigned criterion; see Figure 1. We draw edges between two vertices in
the local alignment graph if the 4-nt alignments which they represent are
compatible with each other. in the sense that they could be merged together to
form a larger valid (well-ordered and uniquely-assigned) alignment. Finding
the optimal alignment then corresponds to ﬁnding the largest set of vertices
such that every pair of vertices in the set are connected by an edge. That
is. we want to ﬁnd the maximum clique of the local alignment graph. This
idea was ﬁrst introduced with 2-arnino acid alignments to solve the contact
map overlap problem for proteins in (Strickland et al.. 2005). Finding the

maximum clique is computationally challenging. but standard routines may
be employed. as we describe below.

2.2 R3D Align implementation

The ideas described in the previous section serve as the basis for
the R3D Align program. which is accessible via web server at
http://rna.bgsu.edu/R3DAlign. R3D Align is also available for download as
a suite of MATLAB programs at that location. The R3D Align MATLAB
code can be run in Octave. which is freely available. We have prepared a
user manual that contains examples of how to use the program.

Speciﬁc details of the R3D Align implementation of the algorithm are
provided next.

To ﬁnd the maximum clique of the local alignment graph. R3D Align
implements a branch and bound algorithm which is similar to the algorithm
presented in (Babel and Tinhofer. 1990). Because the problem of ﬁnding
the maximum clique problem is NP-complete (Garey and Johnson. 1979).
algorithms that ﬁnd the maximum clique. such as the branch and bound
algorithm implemented by R3D Align. may have relatively long running
times in certain cases. However. R3D Align implements a series of techniques
to ensure an alignment will be produced in a reasonable length of time. which
we now describe.

R3D Align uses heuristic graph coloring and clique-ﬁnding procedures
to quickly eliminate vertices that cannot be part of the maximum clique
before the branch and bound algorithm is run. This is a pre-processing
step. A graph coloring is an assignment of colors to the vertices so that
no two adjacent vertices have the same color. R3D Align uses the approach
described in (Biggs. 1990) to color the local alignment graph in 0(L2) time
and a greedy clique-ﬁnding procedure (Babel and Tinhofer. 1990) to ﬁnd a
large clique in 0(L2) time. where L is the number of vertices in the local
alignment graph. Suppose this clique has V vertices. Then the maximum
clique has at least V colors in the coloring of the local alignment graph.
because it has at least V vertices and each vertex needs a different color.
Now if vertex i and its adjacent vertices have been colored with fewer
than V colors. then vertex i cannot be part of the maximum clique and
may be eliminated from the local alignment graph. Checking each vertex
in the local alignment graph takes 0(L) time. Coloring and clique-ﬁnding
are iterated several times. Removing vertices in this pre-processing step
decreases runtime when subsequently ﬁnding the maximum clique of the
graph using the branch and bound algorithm.

Every vertex in the local alignment graph represents a4-nt local alignment.
and every set of vertices that are all pairwise connected by an edge represents
a set of local alignments that can be merged to form a larger. valid alignment.
Thus. any clique-ﬁnding procedure may be used after pre-processing to ﬁnd
a large clique and thus a valid alignment. R3D Align provides the user the
option of using the greedy clique-ﬁnding procedure or the branch and bound
procedure to produce the clique from which the ﬁnal alignment is derived.
The branch and bound procedure is guaranteed to give the optimal solution
but is more costly. The branch and bound procedure is most suitable to use
when aligning smaller structures; we elaborate on this in the next section.

We have implemented other techniques to improve runtimes. R3D Align
can be run using a seed alignment and a bandwidth 13 so that nucleotide i of
structure A will only be superimposed on nucleotides j — 13/ 2 to j + 13/ 2 (13/ 2
is rounded to the nearest integer) of structure B. where j is the nucleotide
to which i is aligned in the seed alignment. This limits the size of the local
alignment graph. which decreases the time required to ﬁnd the maximum
clique. The user can choose to upload the seed alignment (in FASTA format)
or allow R3D Align to internally compute the seed alignment using a dynamic
programming sequence alignment algorithm. Thus. sequence alignments.
which can be obtained quickly but are not as accurate at the individual
nucleotide level. can effectively be used as seed alignments to reduce overall
runtime. This feature allows the user to input an alignment produced by any
other method including DIAL. ARTS. etc.. to produce an improved alignment
using R3D Align.

R.Rahrig et al.

 

This feature also allows R3D Align to be run in an iterative fashion using
the results of one iteration as the seed for the subsequent one. We have
found this to be the most effective way to speed up the alignment of large
RNA structures. such as the large ribosomal RNAs (168 or 238). Parameter
settings for the iterations are discussed in the next section.

2.3 Web server usage

The R3D Align web server provides an intuitive user interface that allows
the user to run the program online in various modalities.

The user can specify the two molecules to align by entering their four-
character PDB code. selecting the codes from a drop-down list of database
ﬁles. or uploading ﬁles in PDB format. For each 3D structure. the user may
enter the chain identiﬁer and/or a speciﬁc list of nucleotides to align. If no
chain or nucleotide list is entered. all nucleotides in the ﬁle will be used
to construct the alignment. Moreover. the nucleotides speciﬁed need not be
contiguous (e.g. the user may enter ‘2.3.7: 10’ as the list of nucleotides. where
7:10 represents all nucleotides from 7 to 10).

The user can also choose the discrepancy cutoff parameter. a’. Smaller
values of (1 require greater structural similarity between neighborhoods and
therefore produce alignments in which only nucleotides in the most similar
regions are aligned. Runtimes decrease with decreasing values of a’. We
suggest the default value (1:0.S as a value that balances accuracy and
computation time (see Supplementary Material S4).

Additionally. the value of the bandwidth 13 must be speciﬁed. The value
of 13 directly corresponds to the user’s belief regarding the accuracy of the
seed alignment. Smaller values of 13 should be used for more accurate seed
alignments while larger values should be used when the seed alignment is
less accurate or unknown. Larger values of 13 generally increase the runtime
of the algorithm. The program ignores the seed alignment when 13 is greater
than or equal to the number of nucleotides in the second molecule.

The number of neighborhoods per nucleotide (17) can also be entered by
the user. In general. alignment accuracy increases as [7 increases although
accuracy levels off around 17:10 (see Supplementary Material S4). Also.
larger values of [7 result in longer running times.

We note that careful consideration should be taken when aligning large
structures. It was noted above that in this case it is best to use an iterative
approach. which decreases runtime while maintaining accuracy. Setting a
low value of p in the ﬁrst iteration limits the number of neighborhoods and
produces an alignment quickly. This alignment. which is more accurate than
the seed alignment used in the ﬁrst iteration. is used as the seed alignment for
the second iteration. Because this seed alignment is more accurate. a smaller
bandwidth can be used for the second iteration. which decreases runtime
and allows a higher value of p to be set to produce an even more accurate
alignment. This iterative approach produces results similar to simply running
one iteration with large values of p and 13. but it does so in signiﬁcantly less
time. The R3D Align web server allows the user to perform an alignment
with up to three iterations automatically.

To determine reasonable values for the parameters for large RNA
structures. we used the pairs of 165 and 23S molecules for which hand-
crafted alignments were produced and presented in (Stombaugh et al., 2009).
Our tests showed that using a two iteration approach with 13:60 and [7:3
for the ﬁrst iteration and 13 :20 and p: 9 for the second iteration produced
accurate results (Supplementary Material SS). Although multiple iterations
are not necessary for smaller molecules such as SS rRNA. we also used
R3D Align to produce alignments of the SS molecules for the sake of more
comprehensive testing. These results are also provided in Supplementary
Material SS.

As we noted above. the user can choose to use the branch and bound
or greedy clique ﬁnding procedure to produce the ﬁnal alignment. For
large RNA structures. the greedy approach should be used. The R3D Align
alignments of the SS. 165 and 23S rRNA molecules mentioned above were
all produced using the greedy method and were found to be accurate when
compared to hand-crafted alignments and were very similar to the branch and
bound results. This is not unexpected because the pre-processing typically

produces a dense graph. and thus the greedy approach often produces a clique
similar in size to the maximum clique found by the branch and bound method.
For example. in the alignment of 165 rRNA. the greedy clique procedure
ﬁnds a clique consisting of 3748 vertices. while the maximum clique is only
0.37% larger (3762 vertices).

3 RESULTS

We tested R3D Align by aligning the 3D structures of SS, 16S,
23S rRNAs of E.coli (E.coli) and Thermus thermophilus (Tth) We
also aligned the 3D structures of SS and 23S rRNAs of E.coli and
Haloarcula marismortui (H.m.). PDB ﬁles 2aw4, 2j01 and ls72
(Klein et al., 2004; Schuwirth et al., 2005; Selmer et al., 2006) were
used for E.coli, Tth. and H .m.,respectively. We chose these test
cases because high-quality hand-crafted alignments are available to
effectively assess the accuracy of the alignments (Stombaugh et al.,
2009). Also, these structures provide appropriate test cases because
they are large and highly structured, with many non-Watson—Crick
base pairs and long-range interactions. Moreover, E.coli, Tth and
H .m.are phylogenetically distant so there are signiﬁcant differences
in sequence and structure. We also tested R3D Align on other RNAs
including RNAseP and tRNA (see Section 3.5).

In this section, we focus on the alignment of the 16S rRNA
molecules of E. coli and Tth., PDB ﬁles 2avy and lj5e, respectively
(Schuwirth et al., 2005; Wimberly et al., 2000). Because the DIAL
and SARA web servers are incapable of producing alignments of
structures this large, we asked the authors of the respective programs
to provide alignments from local installations of these programs.
The R3D Align web server is capable of aligning 16S and even 23S
rRNA molecules. Evaluations of the 5S and 23S alignments can be
found in Supplementary Materials S4 and S5.

To align the molecules, we used the iterative approach discussed
in the previous section, which took 13 min to run. We benchmarked
using a local installation of R3D Align on a Compaq Presario
CQ60 Notebook with one Intel Pentium T4200 processor running at
2.0GHz and with 4GB of RAM. MATLAB version 7.7 (R2008b)
was used for this benchmark.

3.1 Alignment output format

R3D Align produces FASTA output for use in other programs,
and displays alignments in two other ways for visualization and
diagnostic purposes. The ﬁrst is an accessible, tabular (spreadsheet)
representation that captures much of the detail of the individual
3D structures and their optimal alignment in a way that is easy for
scientists to access. The second display is described in Section 3.4.

Figure 2 shows a portion of the spreadsheet produced by R3D
Align to represent the 3D alignment of the E.coli and Tth. 16S
rRNA structures. The entire spreadsheet is provided as an Excel ﬁle
in Supplementary Materials Sl. Each nucleotide from Tth. is listed
in Column 1 by its base letter and number as in the PDB ﬁle. The
nucleotide in E. coli to which it is aligned, if any, is listed in Column
4 of the same row. If there is no corresponding nucleotide in the
E.coli structure, the entry in Column 4 is left blank. Likewise, if
a nucleotide in E.coli in Column 4 is not aligned to a nucleotide
in Tth., the cell in Column 1 of the corresponding row is left
blank. Blank entries such as these indicate that the nucleotide does
not have a structural correspondence. The nucleotide may have
a correspondence at the level of evolutionary homology, however.

as are the nucleotides in Columns 3 and 6. The kind of base-pairing
interaction between the nucleotides of Columns 1 and 3 (if any) is indicated
in Column 2. Column S indicates the base-pairing interaction between the
nucleotides in Columns 4 and 6. Base pairs are annotated by FR3D using
the Leontis/Westhof system. All corresponding base pair types are identical
except the last row shows a near tSW base pair in E.coli Note that nucleotides
U1302 in Tth. and C1302 in E.coli are not aligned to one another. This portion
of the alignment indicates strong conservation between the two structures as
well as proper alignment.

For example, in Figure 2, it is likely that U1302 in Tth. corresponds
to C1302 in E. coli, but they do not superimpose well in 3D.

To capture the 3D context, the alignment also shows the base
pairs made by each nucleotide in each structure, as in the manually
produced base pair alignment ﬁrst presented in Stombaugh et al.
(2009). The ﬁrst three columns are used to list base pairs in the
ﬁrst structure (Tth. in the example) and the next three columns,
the base pairs between corresponding nucleotides in the second
structure (E.coli). For each nucleotide in Column 3, Column 6 of
the spreadsheet shows the nucleotide in E. coli to which it is aligned,
if there is one. If so, the type of base pair made by the nucleotides
in Columns 4 and 6 is listed in Column 5. If the nucleotides in
Columns 4 and 6 do not form a base-pairing interaction, ‘—’ is
displayed. The type of base pair formed between the nucleotides
in each structure, if any, is indicated in Columns 2 and 5 and is
annotated according the Leontis/Westhof system. Cells are colored
according to base pair type. A separate row is provided for each
base pair a nucleotide makes. For example, U1301 is listed twice
because it makes a tWH base pair with A1238 and a CHS base pair
with G1300. The nucleotides in Columns 1 and 4 of the alignment

are listed in increasing numerical order. The spreadsheet thus shows
every base pair interaction detected in each structure in addition to
all of the alignment information. We ﬁnd that for good alignments,
pairs of aligned nucleotides generally make the same base pair types
as nucleotides that are also aligned.

3.2 Comparison of 16S alignments

For comparison to R3D Align, we used various methods to create
alignments of the two 16S rRNA structures; these are noted
in bold in this paragraph. First, sequence-based methods. We
made an alignment of the 16S sequences using a Needleman—
Wunsch (NW) algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) setting
to allow inexact matches and so as to give the most favorable
alignments as determined by the diagnostics in Section 3.3 below.
Also, we obtained an alignment using NAST (DeSantis et al.,
2006), which is speciﬁcally designed for 16S rRNA sequences.
Next, alignments based on 3D structure. The Crystallographer
alignment is implicit in the numbering scheme used by the
crystallographers. In earlier work (Stombaugh et al., 2009), We
constructed a hand-crafted alignment of the base paired nucleotides.
This Basepair alignment is a reliable standard against which
we can compare other alignment methods. As this alignment
only aligns basepairs and unpaired nucleotides do not appear in
thealignment, we have made a Composite alignment by adding to
the correspondences in the Basepair alignment all correspondences
from the R3D Align alignment that are consistent with the Basepair
alignment. Alignments by SARA and DIAL were provided by
the authors of the respective programs. The ARTS alignment
was obtained using the ARTS web server. The results obtained
with SARSA/PARTS were erratic, so we do not present a
comparison.

Figure 3 uses the spreadsheet display to compare several
alignments side by side. It compares a portion of the R3D Align
alignment (using the greedy clique procedure only) to six of
the other alignments listed above, the Basepair alignment, the
sequence alignments produced by NAST and NW, and the 3D-
to-3D alignments produced by ARTS, SARA and DIAL. The ﬁill
comparison plus the Composite and Crystal alignments appears in
Supplementary Material S2. We list all of the base pair interactions
of the Tth. structure in Columns 1—3 as above. Then the aligned
nucleotides are placed in the subsequent columns, three columns
per alignment. Aligned nucleotides are again located in the same
row, but no extra rows are added to display all nucleotides from
E.coli. Figure 3 shows that, in the indicated region, R3D Align
agrees almost entirely with the manual Basepair alignment. NAST
aligns this region very well. ARTS agrees with R3D Align except
that it aligns very few of the nucleotides in the internal loop,
helix and hairpin extending from C149 to U172 in Tth. The
SARA alignment generally agrees with R3D Align, but fails to
correctly align two nucleotides in the hairpin extending from G159
to A162. The DIAL alignment is off by one or two nucleotides
in each position and consequently does not align any base pairs.
The NW alignment, although it allows inexact matches, also
struggles in places because the two structures have relatively
low (69%) sequence similarity within this region. However, NW
performs better where the sequence conservation is higher, such
as the helix and internal loop of G144 to C153 and G168 to

interactions.

3.3 Alignment diagnostics

The spreadsheet described above is over 1800 lines long and
does not report on the quality of the geometric superposition of
aligned neighborhoods. Therefore, we also computed several global
diagnostics for each alignment. We recognize that it may not be
possible to deﬁne what a perfect 3D-to-3D alignment is (Brown
et al., 2009), but nevertheless it is important to develop effective
tools for assessing alignment quality. Because we focus on the
alignment of homologous molecules, we utilize effective diagnostics
for this situation. In addition to the geometric similarity of the
aligned regions, the number of aligned base pairs is a signiﬁcant and
relevant measure of the accuracy of the alignment in this situation.
Also, we have concentrated on aligning molecules for which high-
quality hand-crafted alignments are available for comparison. The
diagnostics are summarized in Table 1.

The ﬁrst two rows of Table 1 simply count the number of aligned
nucleotides. R3D Align aligns nearly as many nucleotides as the

Composite alignment. Sequence alignment methods like NW and
NAST and the Crystallographer alignment suffer from the problem
that they basically need to align things even if they do not correspond
very well in 3D. They have little reason not to align nucleotides
that are sandwiched between aligned nucleotides. Thus, they tend
to align more nucleotides than the other methods. Row 2 of Table 1
shows that NW tends to create an alignment with a greater number
of identical base correspondences than the other methods. ARTS
aligns signiﬁcantly fewer nucleotides than the other methods.

Because of the high degree of structure conservation between
these two structures, a good performance characteristic is the
number of base pairs aligned by each method. In Table 1, these
are broken down according to whether they are nested cis Watson—
Crick/Watson—Crick base pairs (as in helices), non-nested Watson—
Crick base pairs (as in pseudoknots), nested non-Watson—Crick (as
in internal loops), or non-nested non-Watson—Crick base pairs (as in
A-minor and other tertiary interactions). In these four categories,
R3D Align performs nearly as well as it can, and outperforms
the other alignment techniques. The backbone-based methods do
better on stacking interactions, which are often between adjacent
nucleotides, than on base pairs. Base—phosphate interactions were
described in Zirbel et al. (2009). They are most often found in highly
conserved regions, which explains why the NW alignment preserved
so many of them

We also calculated measures of how well aligned nucleotides
superimpose, both locally and globally. For local superpositions,
for each nucleotide in Tth., we found the nearest four nucleotides
in Tth. which were aligned to nucleotides in E. coli, and then found
the geometric discrepancy between the ﬁve nucleotides from Tth.
and the corresponding ﬁve nucleotides from E.coli The mean and
median of these discrepancies is given in the table. This diagnostic
is somewhat independent of the method used by R3D Align, as it
uses 5-nt neighborhoods rather than 4, and as it may superimpose
nucleotides that are never part of the same 4-nt neighborhood.
In particular, it will give large error readings in places where
nucleotides that are nearby in Tth. are aligned to nucleotides that are
farther apart in E. coli, which happens at the boundaries of element
expansion regions.

Table 1 shows that the R3D Align alignment outperforms the
other automated 3D-to-3D alignment methods according to the
most relevant metrics. R3D Align correctly aligns more nucleotides
engaged in base pair, stacking and base—phosphate interactions than
do SARA, ARTS and DIAL, and approaches the correct counts of
the manually derived alignment. R3D Align also achieves the lowest
mean local discrepancy value. The fact that ARTS achieves a lower
median local discrepancy value than R3D Align is not necessarily
surprising as the main problem with the global alignments produced
by ARTS is not nucleotides that are misaligned, but nucleotides that
should be aligned and are not. What ARTS does align, it aligns
well. Among the three methods that use reduced representations
of structures and then apply a quadratic time algorithm, SARA
outperforms both DIAL and SARSA/PARTS (data not shown) in
all categories.

3.4 Visual assessment of local superposition quality

Given an alignment of two RNA structures, it is useﬁil to know
which aligned nucleotides superimpose well and which do not. In
Figure 4, ‘bar diagrams’ display several alignments using straight
line segments to connect the corresponding nucleotides in the

two structures. As above, for each aligned nucleotide in Tth., we
found the nearest four nucleotides in Tth. which were aligned to
nucleotides in E.coli, and then found the geometric discrepancy
between the 5 nt from Tth. and the corresponding 5 nt from E.coli
The lines are then colored according to the geometric discrepancy
between the 5-nt neighborhoods. Figure 4 makes it clear that R3D
Align performs nearly the same as the manually derived Composite
alignment. It should be noted that one reason red lines appear in the
Composite alignment is because of manual identiﬁcation of errors
in the crystal structures and subsequent manual alignment of those
nucleotides, as described in Stombaugh et al. (2009). SARA does
very well, but does have some localized poorly aligned regions, as
indicated by the sections with many red lines. ARTS does well where
it make correspondences, but it is clear from the ﬁgure that it leaves
out some large regions entirely. DIAL does well in some regions, but
poorly in others. The NW alignment is good in some places, poor
in others. This is no surprise; any NW algorithm requires sequence
conservation to perform well, and some regions are more highly
conserved than others.

The NAST alignment, which is optimized for 16S rRNA
alignment, performs similarly to the Crystallographer alignment.

3.5 Alignments of other structures

To further evaluate R3D Align we also tested it on Ribonuclease
P (RNase P), a ubiquitous RNA enzyme (ribozyme) that plays a
critical role in all cells. We bench-marked the alignment produced
by R3D Align with the manually produced structural alignment
presented in Krasilnikov et al. (2004). There are two distinct types
of bacterial RNase P, types A and B, which differ signiﬁcantly in
sequence and secondary structure of their S-domains, the part of
the ribozyme that binds tRNA. Nonetheless, the 3D structures are
quite similar, allowing for the conserved ﬁinction of binding tRNA.
Thus, correct alignment of the S-domains of A- and B-type RNase
Ps is a signiﬁcant challenge. We used R3D Align to align the A-type
S domain contained in PDB ﬁle 1U9S and the B-type S domain

contained in 1NBS:B (Krasilnikov et al., 2003). The R3D Align
alignment was found to be in agreement with the ﬁndings described
in Krasilnikov et al. (2004). That is, elements that were described
as being present in both structures were aligned by R3D Align,
while all elements that exist in only one of the structures were
not assigned correspondences in the other structure. We used an
iterative approach. Since these are smaller structures, we used the
branch and bound method in both iterations. In the ﬁrst iteration,
we used (1:05, 11:3, 13: 100. We used (1:05, [1:9, 13:40 for
the second iteration. The entire alignment spreadsheet is included in
Supplementary Material S3. For ease of comparison, the nucleotides
have been labeled according to which elements of the structure they
belong using the same numbering scheme as used in Krasilnikov
et a1. (2004).

To highlight the difference between the rigid superpositions used
by ARTS and the local superpositions used by R3D Align, we
used both programs to align an A-site bound tRNA(phe) (3I8G:B)
with a tRNA(thr) bound in the pre-accommodated state (2WRN:Y).
R3D Align aligns 56 of the 69 unmodiﬁed nucleotides in 2wrn (it
cannot read modiﬁed nucleotides), whereas ARTS aligns just 14
nt. The entire spreadsheet containing the alignment is provided in

Supplementary Material S6. Visual inspection of the two structures
veriﬁes that they differ rather dramatically in their overall 3D
conformation, but that their local structure is similar in most
places.

4 DISCUSSION

One application of an accurate 3D-to-3D alignment method such as
R3D Align is to create a consensus interaction list. One application
of an accurate 3D-to-3D alignment method such as R3D Align is
to create a consensus interaction list. For a variety of reasons, two
crystal structures of the same molecule (whether from the same
organism or different organisms) will show small variations in the
local structure of the RNA. When one structure shows a base pair
but the other shows the corresponding two bases falling just outside
the classiﬁcation limits, it is reasonable to infer the presence of
the base pair in the second structure. A R3D Align alignment can
be used to locate near base pairs in one structure that are aligned
with true base pairs in another. The near base pairs can then be
inferred to be true base pairs. This could be used in conjunction with
annotation program like FR3D, and the results would be useful for

programs which search the annotations rather than the 3D structures.
A consensus interaction list will be useﬁil to crystallographers when
they are trying to decide how to model a base pair. Finally, it will be
useﬁil for programs like JAR3D (manuscript in preparation), which
use 3D structure to make multiple sequence alignments.

In this article, we have used measurements based on local
superpositions rather than one global superposition in order
to accommodate the conformational ﬂexibility of large RNA.
Speciﬁcally, evaluating alignments based on the mean or median
geometric discrepancy of aligned local neighborhoods is a
concise way of revealing the structural similarity of aligned local
neighborhoods is a concise way of revealing the structural similarity
of aligned nucleotides at a local level.

R3D Align is based on FR3D. Once FR3D is extended to read
modiﬁed nucleotides, R3D Align will be able to superimpose RNA
3D structures containing such nucleotides. We will re-examine the
seed alignment generated internally by R3D Align; improvements
here will allow the user to set a narrower bandwidth and thus reduce
the running time. We will implement an interface which will allow
the user to specify a portion of the alignment to view as a local
superposition between the two 3D structures. Finally, we would
like to extend R3D Align from pairwise alignment to simultaneous
alignment of three or more structures.

5 CONCLUSION

We have introduced a new method for aligning two RNA 3D
structures and provided an implementation of this method in the
‘R3D Align’ program suite and web server. In contrast to the existing
methods which either rely on a reduced, linear representation of
the 3D structure or on single global rigid superpositions, we focus
on superpositions of local neighborhoods, which take into account
interactions of all types while maintaining independence from
discrete classiﬁcations of pairwise nucleotide interactions. .

We have shown that R3D Align can be used to accurately align
large RNA structures. The 16S rRNA alignment produced by R3D
Align was compared with alignments produced by other methods.
It was shown to be the most accurate and to closely approximate
a hand-crafted alignment. We have also introduced new display
methods and diagnostics to compare and evaluate alignments.

Among the new tools introduced is a spreadsheet which displays
all of the alignment information in addition to all base pairs
detected in the structure. This spreadsheet format is also useful for
comparing different alignments side-by-side. New ‘bar diagrams’
were introduced which concisely display the alignment and the
structural similarity of the local neighborhoods of each aligned
nucleotide.

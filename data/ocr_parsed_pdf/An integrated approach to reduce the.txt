(Lunetta et al., 2004). RF maintains this advantage even if many
noise SNPs are present (Bureau et al., 2005). Applying RF to
genome—wide data is feasible, though computationally burden—
some. With empirical genome—wide data, RF is capable of repli—
cating GWAS results and identifying additional candidate SNPs
(Goldstein et al., 2010).

Although these results are encouraging, further study is neces—
sary to establish RF and GBM as viable alternatives to GWAS
methods. Few studies of SL methods account for linkage disequi—
librium (LD), utilize realistic effect sizes or compare the sensitiv—
ity of the SL method to GWAS. Roshan et a]. (2011) considered
more realistic LD and effect sizes but only focused on RF as a
second—stage analysis. Meanwhile, GBM merits further consid—
eration based on its strong performance relative to RF. Studies
show GBM performs even better than RF for many data types
(Caruana and Niculescu—Mizil, 2006; Hastie et al., 2009; Ogutu
et al., 2011) but evaluation of its performance with genome—wide
SNP data is still needed.

In addition, concerns have been raised about the impact of
minor allele frequency (MAF) and LD on the variable import—
ance measures used by RF and GBM to rank—order SNPs. With
respect to LD, importance scores for correlated functional SNPs
are inﬂated when using variable importance measures based on
the Gini criterion (Strobl et al., 2008), whereas importance scores
for functional SNPs correlated with uninformative predictors are
deﬂated (Nicodemus and Malley, 2009). Correlated predictors
do not induce bias in permutation—based importance measures,
though the variability of importance scores is decreased
(Nicodemus and Malley, 2009). MAF may also inﬂuence import—
ance scores, with higher MAF being associated with higher Gini
importance values for all SNPs, and higher permutation import—
ance values for functional SNPs (Boulesteix et al., 2011). The
inﬂuence of MAF may be attributed, at least in part, to the
tendency of the RF algorithm to prefer predictors with higher
variability (Strobl et al., 2007). Taken together, such effects may
increase the difﬁculty of detecting disease—causing variants
located in LD blocks or with low MAF, especially when using
Gini—based importance measures.

Methods for controlling the impact of MAF and LD on vari—
able importance have been proposed. To address the effect of
LD, Meng et a]. (2009) introduced a modiﬁed RF algorithm and
accompanying importance measure that account for the compe—
tition between correlated SNPs for inclusion in RF models.
Strobl et a]. (2008) developed a conditional permutation
scheme for the variable importance that successfully addresses
the impact of correlated predictors. Alternatively, pseudocovari—
ates (PCVs) may be added to the data to simultaneously address
the effect of all structure in the data that are unrelated to the
phenotype (Sandri and Zuccolotto, 2008, 2010).

Although each of these methods have been demonstrated to
potentially reduce the impact of LD and MAF, all three increase
the computational burden beyond what is feasible for
genome—wide data. Meng et a]. (2009) speciflcally note that
their method does not scale to be feasible with genome—wide
data. The current implementation of the conditional methods
proposed by Strobl et a]. (2008) also have substantially larger
memory requirements than conventional RF. Correction with
PCVs is similarly infeasible, effectively doubling the size of the

data and requiring a number of replications of the analysis to
establish stable estimates.

In sum, to establish RF and GBM as viable methods for
genome—wide SNP data, it will be necessary (i) to address
concerns over the impact of LD and MAF while maintaining
computational feasibility and (ii) to provide a direct comparison
with conventional GWAS methods under realistic conditions.

In this study, we propose and evaluate a procedure designed to
reduce the impact of LD on RF, GBM or related SL methods for
genome—wide data. The proposed method creates overlapping
subsets of SNPs from a genome—wide dataset under the con—
straints that SNPs within a set are not in LD, and that each
SNPs is represented in at least a user—specifled number of subsets
(see Methods). The SL method of choice can then be performed
on the subsets without concern for LD, followed by an aggre—
gation of results over subsets. Next, we show that the proposed
subsetting procedure is computationally feasible for genome—
wide data. Dividing the data into subsets makes analysis of
each piece more manageable and facilitates parallel computation
across multiple cores or on a high—performance grid for a drastic
reduction of computing time. Third, we evaluate a correction
for the impact of MAF adapted from the methods proposed
by Sandri and Zuccolotto (2008, 2010), which is computation—
ally feasible in combination with the subsetting procedure.
Specifically, in each subset, we generate a small set of independ—
ent PCVs with zero association with the phenotype, coded as
SNPs with MAF ranging from 0.01 to 0.50. Variable importance
estimates for the PCVs in each subset are aggregated to provide a
stable estimate of variable importance attributable to MAF. This
estimate can then be used to correct the importances of the em—
pirical SNPs. Finally, we provide a rigorous direct comparison of
the sensitivity of RF and GBM to the Armitage trend test (ATT;
Armitage, 1955), the test utilized most frequently in conventional
GWAS analyses (McCarthy et al., 2008; Ziegler and Konig,
2010), under realistic data conditions. Using simulated SNPs
embedded in empirical genetic data, we show that the sensitivity
of RF and GBM is broadly consistent with the ATT for SNPs
explaining as little as 1% of the phenotypic variance even under
conditions that do not leverage the advantages of RF and GBM
(i.e. a linear additive model without dominance or epistatic ef—
fects; Lunetta et al., 2004).

2 METHODS
2.1 RF/GBM analysis protocol

2.1.] Random forests RF is a machine learning algorithm
that constructs classiﬁcation or regression trees based on boot—
strap samples of the data (Breiman, 2001). Samples not used to
construct a given tree are the out—of—bag (OOB) sample. At each
node A in a tree, a random subset of the predictors of size mtry is
searched to ﬁnd the predictor that partitions the data into the
subsets that are most homogeneous with respect to the outcome
variable. Thus for a casewontrol phenotype y, at a node A, the
RF algorithm seeks the SNP with split 5 that maximizes the
decrease in heterogeneity

Reduced impact of MAF and LD

 

where AL and AR are the left and right daughter nodes result—
ing from split 5, P(A) is the probability of being placed in
node A by split 5, and I(-) is the Gini criterion
I(A) = 2P(y = 0|A)P(y = 1|A) (Hastie et al., 2009). The prob—
abilities may be weighted based on a user—specifled vector of
prior probabilities classwt (Liaw and Wiener, 2002).

On the basis of the ensemble of trees, RF provides two meas—
ures of the importance of each SNP. The Gini importance meas—
ures the average value of Equation (1) in nodes split using a given
SNP. The mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) importance is the
average decrease in accuracy in classifying the OOB sample after
permuting the given SNP (Breiman, 2002).

Analyses with RF were performed in R (R Development Core
Team, 2011) using the randomForest package (Liaw and Wiener,
2002). Forests were grown to 5000 trees. The number of pre—
dictors attempted at each node, mtry, was set to 0.1 p, where
p is the number of predictors in the data. These settings are
consistent with the recommendations of Goldstein et al. (2010)
for genome—wide data. In addition, prior probabilities (classwt)
and voting thresholds (cuttoﬂs) were set equal to the case/control
proportions for the observed phenotype in each analysis. All
settings were chosen based on performance in pilot testing with
real and simulated data (not shown).

2.1.2 Gradient boosting machine GBM, like RF, is an ensem—
ble method based on classiﬁcation and regression trees con—
structed using bootstrap samples of the data. Unlike RF,
however, each tree is fit to weighted residuals based on the pre—
vious trees in the ensemble. The contribution of each newly
added tree to the prediction is limited by a shrinkage parameter.
Similar to RF, variable importances are computed based on the
average improvement in prediction from nodes split using a given
SNP (Friedman, 2001).

Analyses with GBM were completed using the gbm package
for R (Ridgeway, 2010). As with RF, the settings for GBM were
based on pilot testing with empirical and simulated data. We
used a 0.001 shrinkage parameter, 3000 trees and limited tree
construction depth to first—order interactions.

2.2 LD subsetting algorithm

To reduce the effect of LD on variable importance, we propose
an algorithm to select overlapping subsets of SNPs prior to
analysis, such that the SNPs in each subset are in approximate
linkage equilibrium and each SNP from the genome—wide
data appears in at least a user—specified number of subsets. Sub—
sequently, subsets are analyzed separately and results are
aggregated.

The proposed algorithm creates subsets of SNPs from each
chromosome, then combines these subsets to create genome—wide
subsets. First, for chromosome c, let Dc be the N x p6 data
matrix of the pc SNPs on chromosome c ordered according to
map location. To prevent order effects, begin by permuting the
columns of Dc within blocks of size b, where b is some small
positive integer. In other words, randomly permute the order of
columns 1 to b, columns b+ 1 to 2b ,  of Dc to get the new
data matrix D2“.

To construct the 2th subset for chromosome c, we ﬁrst select
the SNPs associated with columns 2, z + k, z + 2k,  of D2“,

where z and k are positive integers. Selecting k subsets in this
way guarantees that every SNP in D: is selected once. Additional
sets of k subsets can be constructed to ensure each SNP appears
in a user—specifled number of subsets, requiring 5 sets of k subsets
to guarantee that each SNP is included in at least 5 subsets. The
value of k is chosen by the researcher such that ki2b is greater
than the size (in number of SNPs) of the largest anticipated
LD block in order to ensure that the SNPs in columns
2, z + k, z + 2k, . . . of D: will not be in LD. The selection of k
should be guided by using Haploview (Barrett et al., 2005) or
other software to tag LD blocks in regions known to have the
largest LD blocks (or the lowest recombination rate), and setting
k slightly larger than the number of SNPs in the largest observed
LD block.

Next, the subsets are augmented by adding additional
SNPs that are in approximate linkage equilibrium with the
initially selected SNPs, where linkage equilibrium is oper—
ationally defined by a user—speciﬁed maximum pairwise correl—
ation I. These additional SNPs are selected by searching the
intervals between the selected SNPs (e. g. columns 1 to
z — l, 2 + 1 to z + k — l, . . . of Dj). Within each interval, begin
by removing from consideration SNPs that correlate above some
correlation threshold t with the previously selected SNPs before
or after the interval. For instance, for the interval from 2+ 1 to
z+ki l, SNPs correlated with the 2th or z+kth SNPs, which
have already been selected for subset z, are removed from con—
sideration. For this study, we use a threshold of t=0.l. Of the
remaining SNPs, one SNP is randomly selected to be added to
the 2th subset. Any additional SNPs in the interval that correlate
with the newly selected SNP greater than the threshold t are then
removed from consideration. Continue randomly selecting SNPs
in this way until no SNPs remain below the correlation threshold
to be considered.

Once this procedure is finished, the 2th subset for chromosome
c is complete. The 2th genome—wide subset is then defined by the
union of the 2th subset from each chromosome. Pseudocode
summarizing the full algorithm is given in Figure l. The desired
SL method may then be run on each subset, and the importance
of a given SNP is computed as its mean observed importance
across subsets containing the SNP.

2.3 Correction of importances with PCVs

Sandri and Zuccolotto (2010) proposed correcting variable im—
portances by augmenting the data with PCVs, a second copy of
the original predictor variables with the rows permuted to dis—
rupt any association with the outcome variable while maintain—
ing the structure among the predictors. The observed variable
importance of the PCVs across a number of replications provides
an estimate of the importance due to the structure of the pre—
dictors. The importance of each PCV can then be subtracted
from the importance of the corresponding predictor to estimate
the importance of the given predictor that is due to association
with the outcome variable.

The LD subsetting algorithm does not itself address the issue
of MAF but it does provide an opportunity to adapt the ap—
proach of Sandri and Zuccolotto (2010) to estimate and correct
for the importance due to MAF while maintaining computa—
tional feasibility for genome—wide data. For each subset from
the LD subsetting algorithm, independent PCVs are generated
from Bin (2, 1),), where the p,~ are evenly spaced on [0.01, 0.50] at
intervals of 0.001 to fully capture the range of MAF values in
GWAS data. These 491 PCVs are then appended to the subset of
SNP data and analyzed with the selected SL method. After all
subsets are analyzed, the importances are averaged to produce a
single variable importance for each PCV.

Next, a loess regression curve is ﬁt to the observed variable
importances of the PCVs to estimate the expected importance at
each MAF. The loess curve is selected to provide a smooth esti—
mate without requiring speciﬁcation of the non—linear relation—
ship between MAF and variable importance (Supplementary
Fig. S1). In this way, we obtain expected importances due to
the effect of MAF only for MAF values in [0.01, 0.50].

The expected importance at each MAF can then be used
to correct the importances that are observed when using RF
or GBM. Speciﬁcally, for a given SNP with MAF m, subtract
the expected importance at m, as estimated by the loess curve,
from the observed importance for the SNP. The remaining im—
portance for the SNP can be attributed to association with the
phenotype.

Finally, to account for differences in the variability of the im—
portance measure attributable to MAF, the corrected import—
ance of the SNP is scaled by the standard deviation across
subsets of the importance of the PCV with p,~ closest to the
MAF m. This is analogous to constructing a 2 statistic, with
the PCVs providing an estimate of the mean and standard devi—
ation for the null distribution of variable importances condi—
tional on MAF. The resulting corrected variable importance
may then be used to compare SNPs as usual.

Note that our proposed implementation of PCVs differs from
Sandri and Zuccolotto (2010) on two key points. First, we gen—
erate PCVs as a small number of random binomial variables with
varying MAFs, rather than using permuted rows from the data.
This modiﬁcation is justiflable because after LD subsetting the
only known problematic structure in the data is variation in
MAF. Second, we proﬁt from the fact that we can include the
small set of PCVs in each LD subset instead of having to perform
multiple replications with the full data to get a stable estimate of
the effect of MAF, allowing us to maintain computational feasi—
bility for genome—wide data.

2.4 Embedding simulated SNP in empirical data

For this study of the impact of LD and MAF on variable im—
portance, we simulate data for a SNP in LD with a range of
MAF values. Speciﬁcally, we use an iterative procedure to simu—
late a SNP that correlates with an existing empirical SNP at a
given correlation ,0 and with a specified MAF. By embedding the
simulated SNP in empirical SNP data, we are able to maintain a
realistic data structure for the simulation studies. A different
option would be to use one of the empirical SNPs and generate
a phenotype value, but such an approach gives less control on
LD and MAF and would require different locations of the target
SNP for the different simulation settings.

To generate the simulated SNP, a continuous variable is gen—
erated ﬁrst by adding noise drawn from N(0,02) to an existing
empirical SNP with complete data. Quantile thresholds based on
the desired MAF, under the assumption of Hardineinberg
equilibrium, are applied to the continuous variable to create dis—
crete SNP data. The correlation between the generated SNP and
the existing SNP is controlled by adjusting 02 for the noise.
Decreasing 02 increases LD with the empirical SNP, whereas
increasing 02 has the reverse effect. Adjustments to 02 are
made iteratively until the observed LD and MAF are within
0.01 of the desired values.

The possible correlation between a pair of SNPs is bounded by
the difference in MAF. As a result, it is not possible to generate
data for a wide range of values of MAF that still have a high
correlation ,0 with a single empirical SNP. Using formulas from
Biswas and Hwang (2002), it is possible to establish the upper
bound for ,0 at the population level for two SNPs with given
MAFs. In f1nite samples, it is possible to achieve correlations
that are somewhat higher than these bounds, but limitations
are still present (Supplementary Information). As a result,
some combinations of MAF and LD are omitted from simula—
tions involving correlation with the empirical SNP, which has
MAF m=0.286, limiting the consideration of 0:09 to only
simulated SNPs with MAF m: 0.3.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluation of LD subsetting algorithm

As a baseline measurement of the impact of LD and MAF on
variable importance in RF and GBM, both RF and GBM were
used to analyze data containing a simulated SNP embedded in a
3000 SNP region of empirical data on N: 2235 individuals from
a published study of hair morphology (Medland et al., 2009). An
LD map of the 3000 empirical SNPs is shown in Supplementary
Figure S2.

The simulated SNP was generated with one of four levels of
LD (i.e. correlation ,0 = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 with the neighboring em—
pirical SNP) and one of ﬁve levels of MAF (m=0.05, 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, 0.5). LD and MAF levels were fully crossed, excluding con—
ditions where data generation is not possible (see Methods). A
case/control phenotype unrelated to the SNPs was generated
with a probability 0.36 of being a case. Resulting variable im—
portance measures from RF and GBM were collected for 250
replications for each combination of LD and MAF. Replications
with invalid data generation were discarded.

‘Detection’ in each replication is defined as importance (or test statistic) for a functional SNP greater than the highest observed importance among simulated
SNPs unassociated with the phenotype. Results are given for the ATT, uncorrected GBM importance, GBM with LD subsetting, and GBM with PCVs,
showing that in most cases the detection rate for GBM—based methods is within sampling error of the ATT. Proportions are out of 250 replications. Values in

bold have conﬁdence intervals that overlap the conﬁdence interval for the detection rate of the ATT.

correction for multiple testing (Table 2). LD subsetting also in—
creases the relative importance of tag SNPs in LD with a func—
tional SNP, reducing the downward pressure on the importance
of SNPs in a strong LD block (Supplementary Fig. S8). Similar
results are observed for RF (Supplementary Table S4).

Investigation of the detection rates for GBM with and without
LD subsetting shows LD subsetting markedly improves detec—
tion of the functional SNPs in LD blocks. In exchange, there is a
modest decrease in the detection rate for SNPs not in LD, espe—
cially at low MAF (Table 3). For RF, LD subsetting improves
detection rates for the MDA importance but signiﬁcantly im—
pairs detection of functional SNPs with low MAF when using
the Gini importance (Supplementary Table S3), likely due a
strengthened effect of MAF.

3.4.3 PC V correction Although the effect of MAF on the
importance of effect SNPs after LD subsetting is non—significant
(Table 2), the inclusion of PCVs to correct for MAF may still be

desirable to at least partially address the impact of MAF on the
importance of null SNPs. As before, the computational burden
of RF leads us to focus on the results for GBM.

Figure 3c depicts the resulting GBM variable importances
after inclusion of PCVs. Although the effect of LD remains
non—significant, there is a strong, significant effect of MAF on
the importances (Table 2). This result is unsurprising given that
the trend of GBM variable importances associated with MAF
works in the opposite direction for functional SNPs compared
with non—effect SNPs. By adjusting the importance to account
for the inﬂated importance of non—effect SNPs with high MAF,
the PCV correction strengthens the trend toward lower import—
ance for functional SNPs with high MAF values. As before, the
resulting trend in variable importances may be interpreted as
reﬂecting the magnitude of regression coefﬁcients rather than a
direct effect of MAF (see Supplementary Information).

The impact of including PCVs on the detection rate is more
limited. Analyses using GBM with PCVs show slightly higher

detection rates for SNPs with low MAF, and a moderate
decrease in detection rates for SNPs with higher MAF, but the
difference is generally within sampling variation (Table 3).

3.4.4 Armitage trend test To establish the usefulness of SL
methods for genome—wide data, it is important to compare
their performance to conventional methods. Since the current
simulations rely on the same additive genetic model assumed
by the ATT, we do not anticipate that RF and GBM will provide
any improvement over the detection rate of the ATT. Instead, we
hope to show that even under ideal circumstances for the ATT,
little sensitivity is lost by using RF and GBM, such that RF and
GBM may improve sensitivity to epistatic and non—additive ef—
fects without substantial sacrifices of sensitivity to additive
effects.

Comparison of the detection rates for GBM with the ATT
indicates that in most conditions the difference between the
two methods is within the range of sampling variation, especially
when LD subsetting is used (Table 3). Indeed, there is a strong
visual similarity between the pattern of observed P—values for the
ATT and the corresponding variable importances from GBM
with LD subsetting (Supplementary Figs S8b and S9). Results
for RF are somewhat weaker (Supplementary Table S3). Note
that in order to maintain a fair comparison, we define detection
for the ATT by treating the test statistic as an analog to the
variable importance rather than requiring statistical signiﬁcance.
In sum, it appears GBM, with the aid of LD subsetting, does not
substantially under—perforrn the ATT, even under ideal circum—
stances for the ATT.

4 DISCUSSION

SL methods such as RF and GBM are a viable alternative to
conventional parametric testing of individual SNPs in a GWAS.
However, there are valid concerns over the impact of LD and
MAF on variable importance measures that must be addressed.
In response, this study presents an integrated approach to mean—
ingfully reduce the effect of LD and MAF on variable import—
ance in RF and GBM.

The results of this study show that the proposed subsetting
algorithm can successfully reduce or eliminate the effect of LD
on the variable importance measures of RF and GBM. The pro—
cess of aggregating results over the subsets is not biased by the
number of subsets containing a given SNP and, in many cases,
may aid the detection of effect SNPs. In particular, the use of LD
subsetting can be expected to aid RF and GBM is identifying
effect SNPs within LD blocks. Since LD subsets are constructed
prior to analysis, the procedure could also be applied to other SL
methods.

Importantly, GBM provides detection rates for the functional
SNPs within sampling variation of detection rates for the ATT.
This result for GBM is especially encouraging given that this
study uses an additive genetic model that precisely matches the
type of effect anticipated by the ATT. SL methods may be
expected to provide substantial improvement over the ATT for
detecting correlated effect SNPs and SNPs with non—additive and
epistatic effects (Garcia—Magarinos et al., 2009). Alternatively,
RF and GBM may act as an initial screen to reduce genome—wide
data to a set of candidate SNPs small enough to make thorough

modeling of their complex relationships feasible using penalized
regression or other appropriate methods (Ayers and Cordell,
2010).

The LD subsetting approach also facilitates the introduction
of PCVs, as proposed by Sandri and Zuccolotto (2010), which
may potentially be used to correct for the effect of MAF on
variable importance measures. The proposed PCV correction
evaluated in this study provides a marked reduction in the
effect of MAF on non—effect SNPs. Caution is necessary in
applying PCVs, however, given a moderate effect of MAF re—
mains and the effect of MAF on the importance of functional
SNPs may be magniﬁed, with uncertain implications
(Supplementary Information). Still, PCVs at minimum provide
the option of emphasizing sensitivity to SNPs with low MAF,
which may contain the majority of heritable variance for some
phenotypes, such as high—density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
(Park et al., 2011), and can be difficult to detect with conven—
tional methods (Wang et al., 2005). Finally, in addition to PCVs
numerous covariates for comorbid disorders, environmental fac—
tors and other inﬂuential variables may be included in the ana—
lysis with a much lower computational cost than for popular
GWAS software (Shabalin, 2012).

A number of factors may be considered in seeking to improve
the approaches evaluated by this study. More careful tuning of
the metaparameters for the LD subsetting algorithm, including
the selection of k, b and t, may enhance the effectiveness of the
correction. Alternative methods to improve the use of PCVs to
correct for the effect of MAF may also be explored. The correc—
tion proposed here is only one possible application of PCVs;
other versions may improve the effectiveness of PCVs or carry
different advantages tailored to the preferences of the researcher.
Finally, these results show strong results for GBM that are con—
sistent with the more widely known RF; additional work should
be performed to evaluate GBM as a viable tool for analyzing
genome—wide data, especially given its lighter computational
burden.

Although our approach does not fully eliminate the impact of
LD and MAF on variable importance measures, the proposed
corrections provide a satisfying improvement. Importantly, LD
subsetting also facilitates analysis in a parallel environment, im—
proving the computational feasibility of these methods for
genome—wide data. Continuing efforts to establish the validity,
reliability and feasibility of SL methods such as RF and GBM
with genome—wide data will be crucial to establishing these meth—
ods as viable alternatives to conventional GWAS analyses.

the surface. This ﬁnding is consistent with the fact that the innate
immune system is able to detect hydrophobic parts of immuno—
genic proteins containing aliphatic or aromatic amino acids
(Seong and Matzinger, 2004).

Obviously, allergenicity, like antigenicity and immunogenicity,
is a property encoded linearly and non—linearly, and therefore the
alignment—based approaches are not able to identify this property
unambiguously. In the present study, we describe an alignment—
free method for allergenicity prediction based on amino acid
E—descriptors (Venkatarajan and Braun, 2001) and auto— and
cross—covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequences
into uniform equal—length vectors (Nystrom et al., 2000). ACC
was used for quantitative structureiactivity relationship (QSAR)
studies of peptides (Nystrom et al., 2000), protein classif1cation
(Lapinsh et al., 2002) and immunogenicity prediction
(Doytchinova and Flower, 2007). Recently, we applied this
method in combination with k nearest neighbors method to
predict allergenicity (Dimitrov et al., 2013). Here, we improve
the method by using a new set of amino acid descriptors and
a novel descriptor fingerprint approach based on Tanimoto
coefficient similarity search (Tanimoto, 1958).

The E—descriptors for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids,
defined by Venkataraj an and Braun (2001), were derived by prin—
cipal component analysis of a data matrix consisting of 237
physicochemical properties. The first principal component (E1)
reﬂects the hydrophobicity of amino acids; the second (E2%
their size; the third (E3)itheir helix—forming propensity; the
forth (E4) correlates with the relative abundance of amino
acids; and the ﬁfth (E5) is dominated by the ﬂ—strand forming
propensity. In the present study, the ﬁve E—descriptors were used
to describe the protein sequences.

The f1ngerprints in chemoinformatics are developed to de—
scribe the 2D chemical structures (Barnard, 2003; Kochev
et al., 2003; Tomczak, 2003; Willett, 2003). They are generated
in two ways. In the most popular way, the structure of a com—
pound is divided into substructural fragments and assembled
into a binary stringiif the fragment exists in the structure the
corresponding string element takes 1, otherwise, it takes 0.
Binary structural f1ngerprints are especially useful, as there are
highly efficient in computer algorithms working with binary
strings. Daylight has developed another approach (http://www.
daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.ﬁnger.html). The
Daylight f1ngerprints are generated as patterns from the envir—
onment of each atom (up to seven atoms away). Each pattern
serves as a seed to a pseudo—random number generator (it
is ‘hashed’), the output of which is a set of bits (typically 4 or
5 bits per pattern); the set of bits is added (with a logical OR)
to the ﬁngerprint.

Here, we present a novel descriptor—based fingerprint
approach. The f1ngerprint consists of descriptors instead of struc—
tural fragments. This enlarges the area of fingerprint application
outside the chemical structure description, even outside chemis—
try. Moreover, it allows physical and/or biological information
to be included in the similarity search process. Obviously, the
basic problem here is, as in other quantitative structureiactivity
relationship methods, the selection of proper descriptors. They
could be discrete, i.e. Boolean values, e. g. the presence or absence
of given physical, chemical and/or biological features. The
ﬁngerprint is binary codediwhen the given feature presents,

the ﬁngerprint takes 1 at the proper position, otherwise, it
equals 0. Many descriptors have continuous values, e. g. a nuclear
magnetic resonance or infrared spectra, logP, quantum chemis—
try—based descriptors and so forth. These descriptors also could
be converted into discrete values by scaling and dividing into
intervals with regular size. If a descriptor value falls within an
interval, the corresponding fingerprint element takes 1; other—
wise, it takes 0. Obviously, the length of the fingerprint depends
on the number of intervals: as many they are, as longer is the
ﬁngerprint. The longer fingerprints are able to capture more
molecular features than the shorter ones but in the same time
are redundant in information. A balance between f1ngerprint
length and information content should be found in any particu—
lar study.

2 DATASETS AND METHODS
2.1 Protein datasets

2.1.1 Allergens An initial allergen dataset was collected from
the CSL (Central Science Laboratory) allergen database (http://
allergen.csl.gov.uk), the FARRP (Food Allergen Research
and Resource Program) allergen database (http://www.
allergenonline.org), SDAP (Structural Database of Allergenic
Proteins) (http://fermi.utmb.edu/SDAP/sdap_man.html) and
Allergome database (http://www.allergome.org/). The allergen
proteins were searched in Swiss—Prot database (http://www.
uniprot.org) and only sequences with ‘evidence for the exist—
ence of protein—evidence at protein level’ were selected.
Duplicates were removed. The final set of allergens contained
2427 proteins.

2.1.2 Non—allergens A set of proteins from species Solanum
[ycopersicum (tomato), Capsicum annuum (pepper), Solanum
tuberosum (potato), T riticum aestivum (bread wheat) and Oryza
sativa (Asian rice) and Oryza glaberrima (African rice) was col—
lected after search in Swiss—Prot for proteins with ‘evidence for
the existence of protein—evidence at protein level’ and exclusion
of proteins containing the key word ‘allergen’ in their descrip—
tion. The resulting set consisted of 950 non—allergens.
Additionally, a set of non—allergens was collected from Swiss—
Prot to include proteins from Homo sapiens species with
‘evidence for the existence of protein—evidence at protein level’.
The proteins with key words ‘allergen’ and ‘cancer’ in their
description as well as proteins with unidentif1ed amino acids in
their sequences were excluded. The final set of non—allergens
contained 2427 proteins.

The set of allergens and non—allergens used in the present study
is freely accessible from AllergenFP Web site. This set could be
used as a uniform reference set in future studies on allergenicity
prediction as it is manually curated and contains known allergens
with evidence at protein level.

2.2 Presentation of protein sequences by E—descriptors and
ACC transformation

The values for the ﬁve E—descriptors used in the present study to
describe the protein sequences are given in Table 1. To make the
length of the proteins uniform, an auto— and cross—cross covari—
ance (ACC) transformation was used (Nystrom et al., 2000).

Auto—covariance Ajj( L ) and cross—covariance Cjk( L ) were cal—
culated according to the following equations:

niL
E, . X E, . L
A“ L = 2 ./~' ./J+
.1/( ) i n _ L
"7L Em >< EkJ+L
C/k(L)= E 

I

Indices j and k refer to the E—descriptors (j = 1—5, k = 1—5, j 75 k), n
is the number of amino acids in a sequence, index i points the
amino acid position (i: 1, 2,. . . , n) and L is the lag (L = 1, 2, . . . ,
L). Short lags (L = 5 + 20) were chosen, as only the inﬂuence of
close amino acid proximity was investigated. Aj,( L ) and C,“ L )
values were assigned further in the article as ACC values. The
subsets of allergens and non—allergens were transformed into
matrices with 25 x L variables (52 x L) each.

2.3 Descriptor ﬁngerprints approach based on Tanimoto
coefficient similarity search

In the present study, ACC—based descriptor fingerprints were gen—
erated. The 25 x L ACC descriptors were scaled by a factor of
100, divided into K intervals each and converted into 25 x L x K—
digit binary fingerprints. A digit in the ﬁngerprint equals 1, if the
ACC value falls into the corresponding interval, otherwise,
it takes 0. Thus, each protein has a unique binary ﬁngerprint
consisting of 25 x L units and (25 x L x K725 x L) nulls.

The ﬁngerprints for each pair proteins were compared accord—
ing to Tanimoto coefﬁcient:

NC

TAB=—’
(,) NA+NB_NC

where N A and N B are the number of digits in the fingerprints of
structure A and structure B, respectively, and NC is the number
of common digits between them. Tanimoto coefﬁcient takes
value between 0 and 1. The larger is the value, the more similar
are the two structures. Thus, two structures with Tanimoto
coefﬁcient T 20.98 are much more similar than two structures
with Tanimoto coefﬁcient T: 0.56.

2.4 Evaluation of performance

The method for allergenicity prediction developed in the present
study was evaluated by leave—one—out cross—validation (LOO—
CV) and by 10—fold cross—validation (10—fold—CV). In the LOO—
CV procedure, each protein was excluded from the dataset and
compared with the remaining n—I proteins by Tanimoto coefﬁ—
cient. The protein with the highest value for T ( A ,B ) determined
the class identity of the tested protein (allergen or non—allergen).
In the 10—fold—CV procedure, the whole set is divided into
10 groups. Each group was treated as a test set, the remaining
nine as a training set.

The correctly predicted allergens and non—allergens were
deﬁned as true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN), respect—
ively. The incorrectly predicted allergens and non—allergens were
deﬁned as false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), respect—
ively. Sensitivity [TP/(TP+ FN)], specificity [FF/(TN+ FP)],
positive predictive value (ppv) [TP/(TP+ FP)], F1 score [2*sensi—
tivity*ppv/(sensitivity+ppv)] and Matthews correlation coefficient
(M CC) [(TP >< TN 7 FP >< FN)/((T P + FP)(TP + FN)(TN+ FP)
(TN+ FN))1/2] were calculated. For the 10—fold—CV, average
values of the 10 runs were given.

2.5 Web servers for allergenicity prediction

The method developed in the present study was compared to
five servers for allergenicity prediction freely available in the
web. These were AllerHunter, AlgPred, APPEL, ProAp and
AllerTOP.

AllerHunter (http://tiger.dbs.nus.edu.sg/AllerHunter) is a
cross—reactive allergen prediction program built on a combin—
ation of SVM and pairwise sequence similarity (Zorzet et al.,
2002). Each proteins sequence in the training set is vectorized
by performing sequence alignment and Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST) against all other members of the training
set. The protein sequences are represented as vectors consisted of
similarity scores for each pair of proteins in the training set.

AlgPred (http://imtech.res.in/raghava/algpred) predicts aller—
gens by applying four different methods: MEME/MAST motif
search, SVM—based classiﬁcation of allergens and non—allergens
by single amino acid composition [AlgPred(SVM_single_aa)]
and by dipeptide composition [AlgPred(SVM_dipeptide), and
BLAST search against allergen representative peptides
(AlgPred(ARP)]. MEME is a tool for discovering motifs in a
group of related protein sequences. MAST searches in biological
sequence databases for sequences that contain one or more
groups of known motifs. Single amino acid composition gives
the fraction of each amino acid in a protein. Dipeptide compos—
ition is used to encapsulate the global information about each
protein sequence and gives a ﬁxed pattern length of 400
(20 x 20). The BLAST search is performed against a set contain—
ing 24 amino acid long peptides, so—called ARP, and ﬁnds

AllergenFP

 

The comparison between the freely available servers for aller—
genicity prediction showed that most of them performed well and
gave reliable predictions. Some of them, like ProAp(motif),
AlgPred(SVM_single_aa) and AllerTOP, identify allergens
better than non—allergens. Others, like AlgPred(ARP) and
APPEL, are good in identifying non—allergens. Only
AllergenFP and AllerHunter gave balanced predictions of both
allergens and non—allergens. Furthermore, AllergenFP showed
the best performance in terms of F1 and M CC.

ABSTRACT

Summary: With the ubiquitous generation of complete genome
assemblies for a variety of species, efficient tools for whole-genome
alignment along with user-friendly visualization are critically important.
Our VISTA family of tools for comparative genomics, based on algo-
rithms for pairwise and multiple alignments of genomic sequences and
whole-genome assemblies, has become one of the standard tech-
niques for comparative analysis. Most of the VISTA programs have
been implemented as Web-accessible servers and are extensively
used by the biomedical community. In this manuscript, we introduce
GenomeVISTA: a novel implementation that incorporates most fea-
tures of the VISTA family—fast and accurate alignment, visualization
capabilities, GUI and analytical tools within a stand-alone software
package. GenomeVISTA thus provides flexibility and security for
users who need to conduct whole-genome comparisons on their
own computers.

Availability and implementation: Implemented in Perl, C/C-I— -I— and
Java, the source code is freely available for download at the VISTA
Web site: http://genomelbl.gov/vista/

1 INTRODUCTION

Comparing genomic sequences across related species has become
a source of invaluable data on the functional elements in various
genomes (Ponting and Hardjson, 2011). There are a number of
individual programs developed separately for genome alignment
(Chen and Tompa, 2010) and Visualization of comparative infor-
mation (Chan et al., 2012), but few programs and Web servers
integrate the two, giving researchers an opportunity to analyze
results interactively. VISTA (Frazer et al., 2004), Dcode.0rg
(Loots and Ovcharenko, 2005), the PipMaker suite of tools
(Schwartz et al., 2000) and Mauve (Darling et al., 2010) are
some examples of such integration.

VISTA online servers provide a wide range of services, which
allow a user to align and compare sequences from multiple spe-
cies up to 10Mb long using different algorithms (Bray et al.,
2003; Brudno et al., 2003a, b; Dubchak et al., 2009), locate

regulatory sequences using comparative sequence analysis and
transcription factor binding site search (Loots et al., 2002), com-
pare user’s sequences against whole-genome assemblies and
browse pre-computed alignments of hundreds of microbial,
fungal, plant, vertebrate, and other genomes. Comparative re-
sults can be examined through a highly interactive graphic user
interface (GUI) featuring the Visualization of the level of conser-
vation in the format of a continuous VISTA curve based on the
conservation in a sliding window. This concept proved to be
extremely successful owing to the easy interpretation of the
resulting plots.

A novel stand-alone software GenomeVISTA integrates all
well-established popular features of the VISTA family of tools
(Dubchak et al., 2009; Frazer et al., 2004) in one package, and
provides users the opportunity to carry out comparative analysis
of whole genomes on their own computers, allowing for more
flexibility and security of computations. It runs an extensively
tested and recently improved alignment algorithm (Dubchak
et al., 2009; Earl et al., 2014). Simultaneously, the built-in inter-
active GUI allows real-time examination of results of the com-
parative analysis. VISTA Point, a novel Visualization program, is
provided as a part of the GenomeVISTA package.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Architecture. The whole-genome alignment pipeline is a combin-
ation of Perl and C/ C -l- -l- programs and MySQL relational data-
base to store both input genomic sequences and generated
alignments. The pipeline uses the open-source BLAT program
(Kent, 2002) to obtain local hits. The interactive GUI for data
input and the examination of results was written in Java.
GenomeVISTA can be run on any major platform7Windows,
Mac OS X and Linux. In its minimal setup, it requires only a
single machine, but it can also be conﬁgured to use a computer
cluster using SGE/UGE, Condor or Torque batch systems.
Design. Figure 1 shows the workﬂow of pairwise and mul-
tiple whole-genome alignment computations performed by
GenomeVISTA. In the pairwise alignment, the local anchors
between all sequences are computed using BLAT, which is run
in a translated DNA mode, indexing all ﬁve-amino acid words.
Then, Supermap (Dubchak et al., 2009), the fully symmetric
whole-genome extension to the original Shufﬂe-LAGAN chain-
ing algorithm (Brudno et al., 2003a, b), is used to obtain a map
of large blocks of conserved synteny between the two species.

Finally, regions of conserved synteny are aligned using Shufﬂe-
LAGAN. The major difference in the multiple alignment pipeline
is the use of PROLAGAN, a variation of the original Multi-
LAGAN program (Brudno et al., 2003a, b) that allows the align-
ment of two alignments (profiles) and includes an additional step
of predicting ancestral contigs using a maximum matching algo-
rithm. The four stages (local hits, chaining, global alignment and
ancestral reconstruction) are repeated for every node in the
phylogenetic tree.

Runtime. Estimated runtimes for GenomeVISTA depend on
the length and the number of genomic regions submitted to the
program. It varies from several minutes to several hours for gen-
omes from 1 to 50 Mb long (Supplementary Table S1). We rec-
ommend using a computer cluster for improved run times.

Output. GenomeVISTA provides users with an interactive
GUI similar to VISTA Point used for analysis and Visualization
of alignments in all online VISTA applications. It displays a level
of conservation in the format of a conventional VISTA plot and
allows an interactive change of parameters, such as level of con-
servation and resolution of a plot. It also gives convenient access
to all data used and produced in the alignment (Fig. l).

3 DISCUSSION

GenomeVISTA uniﬁes in one package multiple capabilities ne-
cessary to carry out various types of comparative analysis of
genomic sequences and whole-genome assemblies. It aligns

sequences both in finished and draft format, thus allowing to
use it for multiple applications such as genome assembly, map-
ping newly sequence reads on the reference genome and calculat-
ing syntenic regions on complete genome assemblies.
Importantly, it also gives access to the results of the alignment
through a highly interactive interface that makes comparative
analysis of genomic data fast and efﬁcient.

ABSTRACT

Abstract: Computer simulation models can be useful in exploring
the efficacy of HIV therapy regimens in preventing the evolution
of drug-resistant viruses. Current modeling programs, however,
were designed by researchers with expertise in computational
biology, limiting their accessibility to those who might lack such a
background. We have developed a user-friendly graphical program,
HIV Therapy Simulator (HIVSIM), that is accessible to non-
technical users. The program allows clinicians and researchers to
explore the effectiveness of various therapeutic strategies, such as
structured treatment interruptions, booster therapies and induction-
maintenance therapies. We anticipate that HIVSIM will be useful for
evaluating novel drug-based treatment concepts in clinical research,
and as an educational tool.

1 INTRODUCTION

The current standard for the management of uncomplicated HIV
infection is triple-drug therapy. For patients whose therapeutic
options have become limited due to the development of drug
resistance, more complex regimens consisting of four to six drugs
have been attempted (Martinez-Picado et al., 2003; Miller et al.,
2000a,b). Unfortunately, efforts to improve suppressive efﬁcacy
can also increase the likelihood of adverse drug reactions and
reduce patient adherence (Catanzaro et al., 2004; Chesney, 2000;
Claxton et al., 2001). Because newly arising resistance mutations
may be incorporated into the latently infected CD4+ T cell reservoir,
improperly designed primary or salvage regimens may perpetuate a
downward spiral of progressively more limited and poorly tolerated
therapeutic options (Hosseinipour et al., 2009; Izopet et al., 2002). It
is therefore critical to select antiviral regimens that are well tolerated
and optimally tuned to achieve viral suppression and limit resistance.

Mathematical models that simulate the dynamics of viral infection
are powerful tools for exploring the effects of therapy regimens on
virus (Curlin et al., 2007; Perelson, 2002; Rong et al., 2010). Current
modeling programs, however, were designed for theoretical research
use, limiting their accessibility to Clinical researchers and others

who might lack a computational background. To bridge this gap,
we have developed HIV Therapy Simulator (HIVSIM), a graphical
program that enables users to easily explore potential outcomes
under different therapy strategies.

2 FEATURES
2.1 Stochastic, target-cell limited mathematical model
of HIV dynamics

HIVSIM simulates viral dynamics using a previously described
model (Bonhoeffer et al., 1997; Curlin et al., 2007; Ribeiro et al.,
2000). At each time step, the simulator updates the concentration of
drugs, free virus particles, uninfected target cells (CD4+ T cells),
and short-, medium- and long-lived infected cells in the body.
The dynamics of typical primary and Chronic HIV infection are
accurately modeled, as is the multiphasic decline in viral load
commonly observed during antiretroviral therapy. The model is
target-cell limited (i.e. target cell availability limits viral load
when unrestricted by antiretroviral agents) and stochastic (viral
populations experience random ﬂuctuations at low densities).

2.2 Users can alter all pharmacological and virological
parameters and model new drugs

All parameters can be modiﬁed in the ‘Parameters’ window, allowing
users to re-parameterize the model for new therapy regimens. As
much as possible, default parameter values were selected based
on literature-reported data (details in Supplementary Material).
Parameters are separated into four categories: host/virus, drug,
mutation, and simulation parameters. Up to 6 drugs and 10 mutations
can be independently speciﬁed. The model allows users to specify
Cmax, half-life and baseline IC50 values for each drug, and Changes
in drug IC50 values caused by drug resistance mutations. Users
can also deﬁne epistatic terms to account for interactions between
resistance mutations. All parameters and simulation results can be
saved for later retrieval and veriﬁcation.

2.3 Graphical display of results

HIVSIM includes an intuitive graphical user interface that allows
users to simulate a wide range of treatment scenarios. Concentrations
of target cells, drugs and wild-type and mutant virus are graphed
after each run. A key allows curves to be hidden if desired.

2.4 Flexible therapy editor

A graphical therapy editor enables users to deﬁne and simulate
arbitrary therapy regimens. Multiple start and end times per drug

are supported, including regularly repeating patterns (e.g. cycles
of 30 days on followed by 30 days off). Regimens are shown as
horizontal bars in the results graph, enabling easy correlation of
treatment conditions to simulation results. We have predeﬁned seven
three-drug therapy strategies that have been reported in the literature,
allowing users to evaluate for themselves the relative strengths and
weaknesses of commonly discussed strategies.

3 SCENARIO: NEVIRAPINE MONOTHERAPY

Maximally suppressive multi-drug antiretroviral therapy is often
unavailable in resource-constrained settings. A single dose of
nevirapine (SDNVP) has been shown to effectively prevent mother-
to-Child HIV transmission (Guay et al., 1999), but is associated with
the appearance of mutations conferring resistance to non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine.
When SDNVP patients are placed on NNRTI-based regimens within
the following 6 months, signiﬁcantly higher virological failure rates
were observed. However, when NNRTI-based therapy is started
more than 6 months after SDNVP, there is no longer an increased
failure rate (Lockman et al., 2007), suggesting that a ‘washout
period’ may enable drug-resistant strains to fall below a critical
threshold, below which associated regimen failure is unlikely.

This scenario can easily be modeled in HIVSIM (see
Supplementary Material). Simulation results suggest that SDNVP
is least successful when the washout period lasts 30—45 days, but
the probability of Clinical success (undetectable plasma viral load)
increases as the washout period lengthens, and exceeds 90% when
it is 270 days or longer. These results Closely agree with the Clinical
results described by Lockman et al. (2007). A deeper examination of
the results suggests that the optimal washout period length is Closely
linked to nevirapine efﬁcacy, as small Changes in the parameters used
to model nevirapine can cause substantial Changes in the washout
dynamics observed. This scenario illustrates the potential utility of
HIVSIM in elucidating complex viral dynamics and their Clinical
ramiﬁcations.

4 DISCUSSION

Mathematical models can be used to examine the impact of
antiretroviral therapies on HIV infection. We have developed an
intuitive graphical program, HIV Therapy Simulator, which allows
users without a technical background to compare the efﬁcacy of
standard and novel HIV therapy regimens in suppressing viral
replication and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. HIVSIM
may be useful as an educational tool for illustrating the strengths and
weaknesses of various HIV therapy strategies, as well as teaching
evolutionary concepts such genetic drift and epistasis.

HIVSIM may also enable Clinical researchers to evaluate the
logic of novel treatment strategies such as cycling or recycling
pharmacologic agents, and structured treatment interruptions of
various lengths and frequencies. This approach may be particularly
helpful in planning for and evaluating Clinical trials in which it
is not possible for ethical reasons to have a true placebo arm.
However, we caution against using HIVSIM to inform individual
treatment decisions, as simulation models are necessarily simpliﬁed
and cannot substitute for the judgment of a trained Clinician.
Potential future directions for HIVSIM include porting to additional
platforms, adding additional biological features and extending the
program to other infections such as hepatitis C.

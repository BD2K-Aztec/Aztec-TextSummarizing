ABSTRACT

Summary: The relationship between genes and proteins is a
dynamic relationship that changes across time and differs in different
cells. The study of these differences can reveal various insights into
biological processes and disease progression, especially with the
aid of proper tools for network visualization. Toward this purpose,
we have developed TVNViewer, a novel visualization tool, which is
specifically designed to aid in the exploration and analysis of dynamic
networks.

Availability: TVNViewer is freely available with documentation and
tutorials on the web at http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/tvnviewer.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological relationships, such as those between proteins, between
transcription factors and DNA binding sites, and between cells, differ
across different tissues and Change over time. Recent studies have
shown that Changes in network architecture from the cell cycle and
in response to diverse stimuli are quite signiﬁcant (Luscombe et al.,
2004). Despite the dynamic nature of these interactions, the general
scientiﬁc paradigm has often been to consider these relationships
as static entities. However, many recent studies have advanced the
ﬁeld through insight from network dynamics across time or tissue
in a variety of species including: human blood leukocyte response
(Calvano et al., 2005), rice regulatory hierarchies of gene expression
(Jiao et al., 2009), temporal interaction in Caenorhabditis elegans
(Dupuy et al., 2007) and correlated Changes in gene expression
between mouse tissues (Keller et al., 2008). The study of network
dynamics has the potential to produce crucial discoveries in gene
regulation, cell cycle, and cancer progression.

Representing biological relationships visually through networks
is considered the best way to demonstrate the interplay between
different genes or proteins. Network representations of such data
range from the small and simple networks to large, complex
networks that represent thousands of genes. The potential for
network visualization to aid in our ﬁindamental understanding of
biological relationships has resulted in an explosion of software
platforms and visualization toolkits (Pavlopoulos et al., 2008;
Suderman and Hallett, 2007). These software applications include
popular tools such as Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003), Osprey

(Breitkreutz et al., 2003), VisANT (Hu et al., 2009), Graphle
(Huttenhower et al., 2009) and many more. While some tools
are speciﬁc to biology, others such as Medusa (Hooper and Bork,
2005) are general purpose and can be customized to other domains.
Each network visualization tool approaches the problem from a
different angle; advantages and disadvantages between them are
varied. However, despite the complex array of software available,
there remains the unmet need for software to explore dynamic
networks (Pavlopoulos et (11., 2008; Suderman and Hallett, 2007).
To explore dynamic networks, researchers must awkwardly create
a series of static networks and manually inspect them to identify
rewiring behavior.

We have developed TVNViewer, a web site built for the
exploration and analysis of networks that Change over time and
space. Both Circle and force-directed layouts are available for users
to scroll through a series of networks in real time, providing a natural
way to quickly identify network rewiring. Additionally, TVNViewer
gives users access to analysis tools describing how the degree of the
nodes and descriptors in the network Change over time. Although
TVNViewer was developed with biological interactions in mind, it
can be used for any type of dynamic network.

2 TVNVIEWER OVERVIEW

TVNViewer is built for the visualization of small to moderate
datasets of up to 500 nodes for gene—gene interactions, or if genes
are grouped into a descriptor category (such as a G0 category
annotation), TVNViewer can handle up to 5000 nodes Classiﬁed
by up to 100 descriptors. TVNViewer accepts a series of up to
50 networks in text or xml format; detailed instructions on how
to prepare ﬁles are available through TVNViewer’s import wizard.
TVNViewer supports three visualization paradigms: a gene—gene
interaction paradigm, a two-tiered gene—gene interaction paradigm
and a descriptor paradigm where nodes are grouped according to a
descriptor category. Each visualization paradigm provides a slightly
different way to explore the network; examples of each paradigm
are available by running the examples on the TVNViewer web site.
TVNViewer can be used through a temporary session to upload
data, or users also have the option to create a free user account on
the server in order to save data for ﬁiture access.

3 TVNVIEWER VISUALIZATION TOOLS

There are many different views and controls available to users
through TVNViewer, all of which are documented online.

Fig. 1. TVNViewer dynamic network Visualization. This ﬁgure was created
from TVNViewer’s Visualization tools. A simulated dataset is shown at
ﬁve stages with distinct differences in the relationships between nodes. In
the TVNViewer. the user can use these types of Visualizations to ﬁnd and
highlight how the network changes.

Additionally, we have provided online video tutorials. Here, we
outline a few of the views and analysis tools available.

One way that users can use TVNViewer to see the dynamic
rewiring of their networks is directly through the Circle View. The
Circle View automatically Clusters nodes according to connectivity,
reducing the number of cross-Circle connections to enhance the
visualization’s interpretability. Nodes are colored according to this
Clustering to give a natural representation of subgraphs that may
exist. From this initial time point, users can scroll through the
different graphs in the series, quickly moving through the networks
to observe the rewiring taking place. The user has complete control
over the node size, edge thickness, font size, presence of the node
labels and the number of edges displayed in the graph. These
can be adjusted according to the user’s visualization preference.
TVNViewer provides users with a direct link to download a .pdf
or .png ﬁle of any view directly to their desktop, enabling the
production of ﬁgures such as Figure 1.

In addition to the Circle view, the user can also explore the series
of networks in a force-directed layout View. Again, the users can
scroll through each time point in the series to observe the dynamics
happening in their network series. The force-directed layout can also
be stopped at any time and the nodes can be moved around in a user
preference manner. The user can allow the network to update while
scrolling through the time-series to see how the network structure
is affected by the rewiring, or they can ﬁx the location of the nodes
and View only how the edges between nodes Change.

In addition to exploring the network visualization directly, we
provide two sets of analysis tools. These tools emphasize how the
gene degree of different nodes Changes over time. Users can examine
how the overall degree distribution of the network Changes over
time. The other set of analysis tools includes two different views

(a linear plot and a stacked plot) that users can use to explore how
the degree of certain nodes or descriptors Changes over time. Such
a View may be useﬁil to identify certain genes that may act as a
transcription factor at some stages of development, but which fall
back to other roles during other times.

In conclusion, TVNViewer provides a visualization framework
for creating ﬁne-tuned ﬁgures that highlight how networks Change
over time or space. Additionally, users can use the web site to explore
the dynamics of the network and also to analyze how the degree of
different nodes in the network Changes over time. Examples and
further documentation are available from the TVNViewer web site:

4 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The TVNViewer web site is implemented using Adobe ActionScript,
Apache and MySQL; TVNViewer runs on all major browsers
with the Adobe Flash plug-in. TVNViewer’s ActionScript code is
built off of the Flare library, an open-source web visualization
project (ﬂare.prefuse.org). Thus, TVNViewer takes advantage of a
recent, powerful visualization library with real-time animation and
dynamically updated views.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Research interests in microRNAs have increased rapidly
in the past decade. Many studies have showed that microRNAs have
close relationships with various human cancers, and they potentially
could be used as cancer indicators in diagnosis or as a suppressor for
treatment purposes. There are several databases that contain
microRNA—cancer associations predicted by computational methods
but few from empirical results. Despite the fact that abundant experi-
ments investigating microRNA expressions in cancer cells have been
carried out, the results have remain scattered in the literature. We
propose to extract microRNA—cancer associations by text mining
and store them in a database called miRCancer.

Results: The text mining is based on 75 rules we have constructed,
which represent the common sentence structures typically used to
state microRNA expressions in cancers. The microRNA—cancer asso-
ciation database, miRCancer, is updated regularly by running the text
mining algorithm against PubMed. All miRNA—cancer associations are
confirmed manually after automatic extraction. miRCancer currently
documents 878 relationships between 236 microRNAs and 79
human cancers through the processing of >26 000 published articles.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that
regulate gene expressions by base pairing to messenger RNAs.
Although the ﬁrst miRNA, lin-4, was introduced in 1993
(Lee et al., 1993), it did not draw much attention until 2000,
when the second miRNA, let-7, was characterized. Studies
found that let-7 regulates a couple of gene expressions in
Caenorhabditis elegans development, and is conserved in many
species (Pasquinelli et al., 2000; Reinhart et al., 2000). Since then,
many techniques have been developed to identify miRNAs. As of
November 2012, >30 000 mature miRNA sequences have been
identiﬁed with a growth of >10 000 in the past year. Current
ﬁndings suggest that miRNAs play an important role in crucial
biological processes, such as cell proliferation (Hwang and
Mendell, 2006), apoptosis (Jovanovic and Hengartner, 2006),
development (Karp and Ambros, 2005), differentiation

(Chen et al., 2004; Shivdasani, 2006) and metabolism
(Wienholds and Plasterk, 2005). Among these, miRNA associ-
ation with disease, especially the association between miRNA
and human cancers, has attracted a great deal of interest in
both scientiﬁc and business ﬁelds.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated
that cancer caused 7.6 million deaths in 2008, about 13% of all
deaths globally (http://turl.ca/xndn). By 2010, cancer surpassed
heart disease as the top killer in USA for the first time. There are
many possible carcinogens including tobacco, radiation, chem-
icals, environmental toxins, Viruses and genetic problems.
However, the causes of many cancers remain unknown. Cancer
involves unregulated cell growth, thereby invading nearby parts
of body during development. Early diagnosis before proliferation
usually makes a difference in treatment and survival rate. The
fact that miRNA expression levels vary signiﬁcantly between
normal cells and cancer cells suggests that miRNA might be
associated with cancer development and potentially could be
used for cancer diagnosis or even treatment. Even though it is
uncertain whether cancer is a cause or consequence of deviant
miRNA expression, miRNA fingerprints are found in all types of
analysed cancers, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical
cancer and lymphoblastic leukemia (Iorio et al., 2005; Lui
et al., 2007; Mi et al., 2007; Takamizawa et al., 2004).

Numerous databases have been created to document miRNA
functionalities either from computational predictions or from
experimental results. Although computational target prediction
methods are fast, experimental validation of miRNA functional-
ities is also needed. The signiﬁcant increase in validation experi-
ments raises the need for having a database to store these results
in some uniform way. However, compared with databases pro-
viding computationally predicted miRNA functions, databases
storing experimental miRNA targets are rare. Most of these
experimentally veriﬁed miRNA target databases are manually
collected, such as miR2Disease (Jiang et al., 2009), miRecords
Oiiao et al., 2009), miRTarBase (Hsu et al., 2011) and TarBase
(Sethupathy et al., 2006) version 1 to 5. Rapid increase in
the number of miRNA-related publications makes the manual
collection more and more difﬁcult. Three databases using text-
mining strategies have been introduced in the past 2 years.
miRSel (Naeem et al., 2010) and miRWalk (Dweep et al.,
2011) contain miRNA interaction data, and miRNA targets
were derived solely from text mining of MedLine abstracts.
TarBase 6.0 (Vergoulis et al., 2012) adds text mining to
preprocess abstracts before human curation. The text mining

preprocessing increased entries about 50-fold as compared with
its previous version without text mining.

Text mining is the process in which useful information
is extracted from text using computational approaches or tools.
Unlike its application in other ﬁelds, accurate biomedical
text mining remains an open problem as a result of specialized
and complex vocabularies. There are three commonly
used text-mining approaches in biomedical realm: (i) co-occur-
rence-based approach, which was adopted by miRSel and
TarBase 6.0; (ii) rule-based approach, which keeps a set of
rules that usually take signiﬁcant amount of time to develop;
and (iii) machine learning, where the required training
data are usually expensive or even impossible to generate
(Kohen and Hunter, 2008). Co-occurrence-based systems are
normally easier to build while the other two provide better
accuracy.

In this article, we proposed and developed rule-based text-
mining approaches to extract miRNA and cancer association
and store them in a database called miRCancer. All the dis-
covered associations have been manually conﬁrmed after auto-
matic extraction. miRCancer currently documents 878
relationships between 236 microRNAs and 79 human cancers
through the processing of >26 000 published articles from
PubMed.

2 METHODS

All miRNAwancer associations in our miRCancer database are ex-
tracted by a rule-based text-mining system and followed by manual con-
ﬁrmation. The rules used for text mining are hard-coded sentence
structures. The system consists of literature collection, named entity
and expression recognition, rule matching, voting, manual veriﬁcation
and recording (Fig. 1).

To collect all relevant publications, the query ‘((((mir) OR mima)
OR microma) OR micro-ma) OR micro rna’ is searched against the
PubMed library. The PubMed provides search results in XML format
with all literature details, including the abstract of the article. As of
October 16, 2012, there have been 26 414 publications generated from
the above query and those publications are the primary input to our
text-mining system. The title and abstract of the articles are used for
the following processes.

2.1 Named entity and miRNA expression recognition

The extraction ability of the system highly relies on the named entity
recognition (NER), which is the miRNA and cancer name recognition.
Compared with other biological sequences, such as genes and proteins,
miRNA names have been formalized early enough so that they are quite
uniﬁed and relatively simple. Most miRNAs are named with the ‘miR’
preﬁx, with the exception of a few miRNAs: bantam, let-7 family, lin-4
and lsy-6. We use regular expressions to identify miRNA names. The
miRNA name preﬁx variations that our system handles include: miR,
miR-, cases with species preﬁx, such as has- and mmu-, etc. Table 1
displays the complete list of miRNA preﬁx variations. A preﬁx is fol-
lowed by a unique numerical number that is assigned sequentially.
Because miRNAs are highly conserved between species and organisms,
identical sequences have the same id number regardless of species (e.g.,
mmu-miR-21 in Mus musculus, hsa-miR-21 in Homo sapiens).

Additional sufﬁxes sometimes are used in miRNA names for hairpin
precursor and hairpin loci information. The miRNA name sufﬁx vari-
ations that our system handles include the following: (i) single letter ‘a’
and ‘b’ for related miRNA sequences that only have small base changes
(e.g. hsa-miR-216a and hsa—miR-216b); (ii) single digits such as ‘-1’ and
‘-2’ for identical miRNAs with different hairpin loci in a given organism
(e.g. hsa-miR-16-1 and hsa-miR-16-2); and (iii) ‘-3p’, ‘-5p’ and ‘*’ for
miRNA sequences expressed from different arms of hairpin precursor
(e.g. hsa—miR-339-Sp) (Table 2). In addition to miRNA’s naming vari-
ations, miRNA names are also written in different abbreviations, such as
‘miR-123, -46, -23’ (Table 3).

Cancer name recognition is performed by comparing the text with a
cancer name dictionary. This dictionary is compiled from the interna-
tional classiﬁcation of diseases for oncology (ICD-O) (Fritz et al.,
2000). The ICD-O has been used in cancer registries for nearly 25
years. The classiﬁcation has two axes: morphology, which describes the
form and behaviour of the tumour, and topology, which describes the site
of origin. Each description is assigned with a corresponding code. The
morphology code starts with ‘M’ followed by four digits indicating the
cell type, and one digit for the behaviour, such as M8010/3; the topology
code begins with ‘C’ followed by a number ranging from 00 to 80, such as
C15.0. We built our dictionary so that each entry contains a collection of
common names and an ICD-O code that consists of morphology and
topology codes. To illustrate, non-small cell lung cancer has the code
‘C34.9, M8046/3’, where ‘C34.9’ signiﬁes that the cancer is located in
lung, ‘M8046’ is the morphology code for non-small cell and the ﬁnal
digit, 3, is the behaviour code for malignant tumour. Additionally, the
dictionary includes abbreviations for some cancer names, i.e. ‘OSCC’
stands for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

A list of 28 terms is further compiled to describe miRNA expression
proﬁles in cancers. Fourteen of them indicate miRNA oncogenic function
while the other 14 specify cancer suppressor miRNAs (Table 4). This
expression dictionary is designed to maximize recall rather than precision,
as the articles will be further examined by the rules and manual
veriﬁcation.

After an article title along with its abstract are processed with the NER
and expression recognition module, the article is then deﬁned as
3-occurrence if miRNA name, cancer name and expression terms are
all present. A 3-occurrence article is then sent to the rule matching
module to match with the pre-deﬁned set of rules.

2.2 Rule construction

Though 3-occurrence likely indicates an miRNAwancer association, it
does not guarantee correctness. Alternatively we found that miRNAi
cancer associations are usually stated with certain sentence structures.
After reviewing a large pool of publications, we have collected 75 differ-
ent sentence structures that researchers use to describe miRNA expres-
sion in cancers. Each sentence structure represents one rule, and all the
structures are further categorized into four tiers depending upon their
structure restrictiveness. There are 26 rules in tier 1, 5 rules in tier 2, 31
rules in tier 3 and 13 rules in tier 4.

“Could be any 1 or more characters, such as 5, es, ing, ion, ed, or, and etc.

Tier 1 rules have miRNA names, cancer names and expression terms
that form a complete sentence. The sentence could be simple or complex,
but it should have a clear subject and predicate structure. The simplest
rule in tier 1 is MIR-PHRASE EXP-V CANCER-PHRASE, where
MIR-PHRASE could be a single miRNA name (e.g. miR-21), a group
of miRNA names (e.g. miR-184, miR-200a, b, c and miR-205) or an
miRNA name mixed with other words (e.g. expression of miR-21).
EXP-V in the rule is an expression term in the verb form, including but
not restricted to: inhibit, over-expressed, promotes and so on. CANCER-
PHRASE is similar to MIR-PHRASE in that it could be a single cancer
name (e.g. breast cancer), a group of cancer names (e.g. lung, liver and
breast cancers) or a cancer name mixed with other words (e.g. highly
invasive colorectal cancer cells). Tier 1 rules could also be as complex
as EXP-ADJ MIR-PHRASE BE-PHRASE EXP-V ‘in’ CANCER-
PHRASE COMPARE-PHRASE NORMAL-PHRASE. In this case,
EXP-ADJ indicates an expression term as an adjective, while
BE-PHRASE means a to-be phrase with a positive meaning (e.g. is con-
ﬁrmed to be, are found to be). COMPARE-PHRASE and NORMAL-
PHRASE are not essential elements in this rule, but they make the sen-
tence a comparison structure that strengthens the rule. A sample sentence
matching this rule could be: increased expression of microRNA-21 is
shown to be up-regulate in gastric carcinoma compared with correspond-
ing non-cancerous tissues.

Unlike Tier 1 rules, miRNA, cancer and expression terms form a
phrase rather than a complete sentence in tier 2 structures. There is nei-
ther a subject nor predicate, other than a phrase formed by the three
essential elements of the miRNAwancer association. There are two rules
in this category: MIR-PHRASE ‘as’ EXP-N-PHRASE ‘of CANCER-
PHRASE, and EXP-ADJ MIR-PHRASE ‘in’ CANCER-PHRASE.
Examples of sentences matching these two rules could be: miR-34b and
miR-129-3p as the known inhibitor of gastric cancers, increased
miR-499-Sp levels in highly invasive CRC cell lines.

In tier 3 rules, speciﬁc cancer names are absent from the structure;
instead, there is a word or phrase referring to cancers in general, such as
the word ‘cancer’ itself or ‘cancer tissues’. Tier 3 rules are formed by
inheriting all tier 1 and 2 rules and substituting CANCER-PHRASE
with cancer-related words. As a result, tier 3 structures include both com-
plete sentences and phrases. Because cancer names are not speciﬁed by
tier 3 structures, the matching module infers the cancer name either from
the current sentence, the abstract or the title of the article. When inference
occurs, a tier 3 rule could be downgraded to tier 4 depending on the

cancer name source. The inference and rule downgrading will be
described in the next section. Moreover, miRNA names and expression
terms form tier 4 rules, which are all phrase structures. Similar to tier 3
rules, the cancer names are inferred, but there is no downgrading to this
set of rules. Take tier 4 rule EXP-ADJ MIR-REF MIR-PHRASE as an
example, it could match with the phrase: downregulated microRNAs
miR-34b and miR-129-3p.

We have conducted a test on the accuracy of these rules by randomly
choosing 70 matched sentences, and compared the results with human
evaluations. Among the 70 sentences, 18, 6, 26 and 20 are matched with
tier 174 rules, respectively. And 17, 5, 20 and 12 of them are correctly
interpreted by our algorithm, which gives accuracy of 94%, 83%, 77%
and 60%, respectively. Our test also showed that the results from tier 3
rules downgraded to tier 4 rules have similar accuracy as results from
original tier 4 rules. Based on the test results, we assign voting weight of
0.94, 0.83, 0.77 and 0.60 to tier 141 rules respectively. These weights will
be used in the voting module when rules are used to vote for different
expression proﬁles related to one miRNAwancer pair.

2.3 Rule matching and voting

The matching and voting module has four steps to translate a sentence
into miRNAwancer associations, namely: tokenization, matching, inter-
pretation and voting.

Tokenization is the process that translates each article including the
title and the abstract into generalized tokens. First, all of the miRNA and
cancer names are tokenized as MIR-0 and CANCER-0, while the expres-
sion terms are turned into tokens such as EXP-*-0, where the ‘*’ is N, V,
ADJ and so 011, depending on whether it is a noun, verb or adjective in
the sentence. In addition to the three elements which composite an

Table 5. Primary tokens

miRNAwancer association, other words used to form rules are also
tokenized. After the primary tokenization (Table 5), additional process
encrypts the text with tokens into secondary tokens if possible. The sec-
ondary tokens (Table 6) are all phrases, including the phrases for the
three essential elements of an association as well as other phrases neces-
sary for the rules. During tokenization, the global cancer name for an
article is saved if only one type of cancer is mentioned through the title
and the abstract; otherwise the cancer name in the title is saved as the
global cancer. In case there are multiple types of cancers occurring or no
cancer name exists, the global cancer name is set to null value. The global
cancer name helps tier 3 and 4 rules infer a cancer name to form a com-
plete miRNAwancer association.

Matching is the process to map the tokenized sentences with the rules,
tier by tier, starting from tier 1. This means that each single sentence is
compared with all 26 rules in tier 1, and any matches are interpreted and
participate in the tier 1 vote. If there is a conclusive voting result, the
matching and voting module completes its task for this sentence, and
proceeds to the next sentence. On the other hand, if there is no match
or the vote is a tie, tier 2 rules are used and the matches with tier 2 rules
are translated and take part in the tier 2 vote. The results are recorded if
tier 2 voting generates a conclusion; otherwise tier 3 rules will be pro-
cessed and the same process continues on with tier 4 if necessary. The
sentence to rule matching is a straightforward task, as all tokens and rules
are formed as regular expressions. The situation is handled when a sen-
tence, usually a compound one, is matched with multiple rules. Therefore,
it is possible for one sentence to be matched with multiple rules multiple
times, meaning that several miRNAs may have a many-to-many associ-
ation with various cancers.

Interpretation is the process to decode the matching sentenceirule pairs
into miRNAwancer associations by tracing back the miRNA, cancer

names and expression terms through index numbers attached to the
tokens. Take the rule MIR-PHRASE EXP-V CANCER-PHRASE as
an example: a sentence matching with this rule will have tokens arranged
as MIR-PHRASE-l EXP-V-O CANCER-PHRASE-O. Each miRNA be-
longing to MIR-PHRASE-l will pair up with every cancer name in
CANCER-PHRASE-O, and the miRNAs will have an expression proﬁle
indicated by the term in EXP-V-O. The interpretation could be a little
more challenging if there is more than one expression term in a rule. For
example, the sentence ‘suppression of miR-27a inhibits gastric cancer cell
growth’ matches with rule EXP-N of MIR EXP-V CANCER-PHRASE.
Both the expression terms ‘suppression’ and ‘inhibits’ contribute to inter-
pret that the miR-27a has an oncogenic function in gastric cancer.
Another question in deciphering the rules is how to infer the implied
cancer name when none is speciﬁed. Our algorithm is designed in such
a way that it looks at the current sentence ﬁrst. If there is a single cancer
name present, it is assumed to be the implied cancer and forms the
miRNAwancer association. In case there is more than one or no
cancer name, the global cancer name is used if there is any. While
taking a global cancer name, the rule is downgraded from tier 3 to tier
4, and the voting weight is reduced accordingly. In the worst case scen-
ario, when no cancer name can be inferred, the match is then discarded.
When an interpretation is successful, it generates association sets in the
form of miRNAwanceriexpressioneweight. Each association has a single
miRNA and a cancer name, while the expression is either ‘up’ or ‘down’
meaning oncogenic expression or suppressor functionality, and the weight
is the voting weight of the matched rule.

Voting for a single sentence only takes place when multiple associations
have the same miRNA and cancer but different expressions. Associations
vote by adding their weights together, and the associations with higher
total weight win and the voting iteration is terminated. If there is still a tie
after the tier 4 votes, both associations with opposite expressions are
saved for later use, where associations from other sentences could help

break the tie. Upon completion of processing the article title and every
sentence of the abstract, the collection of associations will perform a ﬁnal
vote to decide which associations should be inserted into the database.
We set the cut-off point at 0.8 so that any voting result with a score >0.8
is recorded for manual validation, otherwise discarded. Recall the weights
assigned to each tier rules, tier 1 and 2 rules have weights >0.8, therefore
an association matched with these rules is guaranteed to be recorded for
further manual veriﬁcation, while the other two tier rules need more
supportive votes to qualify for human analysis. The even votes are also
documented for human interaction.

While recording associations, every sentence where an miRNAwancer
relationship emanates is known. As a result, we therefore only need to
manually review that single sentence to verify the corresponding relation-
ship; once it is conﬁrmed, it will be added to the miRCancer database.
Besides the three essential elements, i.e. miRNAwanceriexpression, add-
itional information is also documented to facilitate building the mirCancer
website content. Each miRNA name is saved with an id and URL link to
the central online miRNA repository, miRBase (Jones-Grifﬁths et al.,
2008), if it is reported in miRBase. Every relation is noted with the article
title and PubMed Id from which the association is extracted.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

By processing 26414 publications, miRCancer currently records
878 pairs of miRNAwancer associations from 573 publications.
Among these relationships, there are 236 miRNAs and 79 human
cancers involved. miRCancer provides a web interface to retrieve
these associations by miRNA and/or cancer names. The results
are showed with miRNA (linking to miRBase entry), cancer,
expression proﬁle and the literature (linking to PubMed) (Fig.

tools that we developed, such as a sequence clustering tool, which
performs clustering on mirRNAs based on sequence similarity.
More information about the tools can be found in our previous
article 0(ie et al., 2010).

3.1 Evaluation and comparison

To estimate the system’s performance, measurements such as
recall, precision and f-measures are estimated by comparing the
system output with a test pool of 400 articles. Among them, 200
articles contain miRNAwancer associations, while the other art-
icles contain miRNA, cancer and expression terms but no asso-
ciations. All the results are manually veriﬁed and the precision is
100%, which is the same as miR2Disease. Furthermore, to fa-
cilitate the comparison with the miR2Disease database, the
number of articles in the test pool for each year is proportional
to the total published miRNA-related articles in that year. The
total published articles on miRNAs and selected number of test
articles from each year are shown in Figure 3.

For the 200 articles with the associations present, associations
were correctly extracted from 157 articles, while nothing was
found in 43 articles, which gives a recall rate of 78.5%. With
the other 200 articles containing no association, the results were
all correctly identiﬁed as true negatives. There are three causes
for not discovering any association in those 43 uncalled articles:
(i) The miRNAwancer relationship is not stated within one sen-
tence. For example, an article may introduce the miRNA target
gene in one sentence, and describe the genewancer relationship
in another sentence; (ii) Associations captured by tier 3 or 4 rules
have a low voting score. Including the associations detected by
tier 3 and 4 rules to manual veriﬁcation will definitely increase
the recall rate. Nonetheless, there are >1000 such associations,
and most of them are false positives. With limited time and re-
sources, we do not manually evaluate those associations. We aim
to improve the recall rate by using other methods; and (iii) There
are odd spellings or typos in some articles. There are instances
where a cancer name is spelled in an unusual way, which was not
captured when our cancer dictionary was constructed, such as
spelling ‘nasopharayngeal’ instead of ‘nasopharyngeal’. Among
these three causes, the ﬁrst type contributes the most to the
missing hits. We plan to include miRNA targets for consider-
ation and allow miRNAwancer relation to be formed from mul-
tiple sentences in our future studies. With a comprehensive
miRNA targets dictionary and careful construction of rules,
the ﬁrst type of problems may be solved.

Table 7. System performance

 

 

Database Recall Precision F-measure
miRCancer 78.50% 100.00% 88.00%
Mir2Disease 28.50% 100.00% 44.40%
Mir2Disease (Before 2010) 77.00% 100.00% 87.00%

 

As the precision is 100%, by combining recall rate with pre-
cision, the F-measure for miRCancer is estimated to be 88.0%,
as shown in Table 7.

Currently there are few databases recording experimental
results on miRNAwancer associations. To our knowledge,
miR2Disease in the only database collecting experimentally ver-
iﬁed miRNA deregulations in human diseases, including cancers.
It was first constructed in 2008. All data in miR2Disease are
manually curated from published articles. We evaluated
miR2Disease against the same pool of test articles, and then
compared the results with miRCancer. miR2Disease has the
same perfect precision, but it has a much lower recall rate
(Table 7). Although the latest update shown on miR2Disease
website is listed as March 2011, we are not convinced that it
contains any data after 2009 because none of the associations
presented in test articles after 2009 could be found in the data-
base. To have a fair evaluation, we also measured miR2Disease
performance on test articles published before 2010. The recall
rate increased from 28.5 to 77.0% as shown in Table 7. The
low overall recall in miR2Disease indicates the difﬁculty in keep-
ing the database up to date while the literature data is increasing
exponentially. As shown in Figure 3, there were >5000 articles
related to miRNAs published in both 2011 and 2012. It is much
more difﬁcult and more time consuming than in previous years
for human to manually identify associations directly from large
volume of articles and update the database. When compared
with miR2Disease, miRCancer has the advantage in reducing
human work to a minimum. The text-mining approach automat-
ically extracts the candidate associations; therefore, for the
manual verification, it narrows down to a much smaller set of
articles where associations were extracted. Also it is much easier
to verify a single sentence where the association is automatically
extracted than reading the entire abstract or text of an article.
More importantly, it still maintains a reasonably high recall rate.
As a result, miRCancer is more effective and feasible to update
while maintaining the same or higher recall rate.

The completeness and accuracy of miRCancer highly relies on
the number and quality of the rules. The more comprehensive the
rule set is, the better recall rate the system can generate.
Nevertheless, some rules, such as tier 3 and tier 4 rules, could
be too weak. They might introduce errors to be able to increase
recall. We have been frequently reviewing the rules with newly
published articles. We would add new rules and modify existing
rules if necessary in order to correctly extract more associations.
In addition to the rules, the cancer name dictionary also affects
the results. Currently there are 149 cancer entries in the diction-
ary. We update the cancer dictionary quarterly to include pos-
sible new names.

4 CONCLU$ONS

miRCancer provides a comprehensive collection of miRNA
expressions in human cancers based on results extracted from
literature. Currently it has 236 miRNA expression proﬁles in
79 human cancers, totaling 878 associations extracted from 573
publications. All proﬁles are manually conﬁrmed. The extraction
process is automated by applying text mining and rule matching
on article titles and abstracts. The miRCancer system has a rea-
sonable good recall rate, but there is still potential for improve-
ment by adding new rules. The miRCancer database can be
queried Via the free access web interface. MiRNAwancer asso-
ciations could be searched by miRNA name and cancer name
independently or a combination of miRNA and cancer names.

The proposed text-mining approach can be extended to ﬁnd
experimentally veriﬁed target genes of microRNA. We plan to
include this expansion in the future.

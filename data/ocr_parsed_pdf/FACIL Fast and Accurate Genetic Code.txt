ABSTRACT

Motivation: The intensification of DNA sequencing will increasingly
unveil uncharacterized species with potential alternative genetic
codes. A total of 0.65% of the DNA sequences currently in Genbank
encode their proteins with a variant genetic code, and these
exceptions occur in many unrelated taxa.

Results: We introduce FACIL (Fast and Accurate genetic Code
Inference and Logo), a fast and reliable tool to evaluate nucleic
acid sequences for their genetic code that detects alternative codes
even in species distantly related to known organisms. To illustrate
this, we apply FACIL to a set of mitochondrial genomic contigs of
Globobu/imina pseudospinescens. This foraminifer does not have
any sequenced close relative in the databases, yet we infer its
alternative genetic code with high confidence values. Results are
intuitively visualized in a Genetic Code Logo.

Availability and implementation: FACIL is available as a web-
based service at http://www.cmbi.ru.n|/FAC|L/ and as a stand-alone
program.

1 INTRODUCTION

The recent increases in read lengths have established next-generation
DNA sequencing as a mature technique, with the ﬁrst machines
capable of single molecule sequencing currently being shipped to
researchers. In most studies, the researchers’ interests lie beyond
translation: the focus is on proteins that are encoded in the DNA, and
their function. Most analyses consider the translation between DNA
and protein a trivial exercise. After all the genetic code or codon
table, i.e. the ‘dictionary’ that translates codons (nucleic acid triplets)

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

into amino acids (AAs), is largely universal and unambiguous
(Koonin and Novozhilov, 2009). However, exceptions in the code of
bacteria (Bove, 1993), eukaryotic nuclei (Helftenbein, 1985; Meyer
et al., 1991), organelles (Barrell et (11., 1979) and their associated
viruses (Shackelton and Holmes, 2008) have been reported and,
given the increasing phylogenetic breadth of sequenced taxa (Wu
et al., 2009), many more such ﬁndings may be anticipated. A quick
survey of the DNA sequences currently in Genbank shows that a total
of 0.65% is annotated as being alternatively translated. If a novel
sequence uses a non-canonical code, open-reading frames may be
different than anticipated due to the reassignment of stop codons and
alternative translations of coding codons. This affects both protein
sequence and function prediction, so these considerations demand
an easy way to assess the genetic code used on a sequenced fragment
or assembled contig.

Non-canonical codes are generally identiﬁed by inspecting an
alignment of the codons on the DNA against homologous protein
sequences identiﬁed by, e.g. BlastX. The program Gendecoder
(Abascal et (11., 2006) automates this process, but it focuses on
metazoan mitochondria and requires an annotated Genbank ﬁle as
input. DNA sequencing increasingly yields fragments and assembled
contigs that contain sufﬁcient information for reliable genetic
code prediction, but performing BlastX searches before knowing
the correct translation table is untenable with the rate of DNA
sequencing accelerating faster than CPU power. Moreover, the
alignment may introduce errors that need to be addressed, preferably
by an automated and validated approach.

2 METHODS

2.1 Training data

We used 5866 annotated DNA sequences to construct the training dataset:
3269 bacterial, 176 archaeal and 2421 organellar genomes (Supplementary
Table 3), representing all such genomes available on July 13, 2010
in the Entrez genome database. From these genomes, we composed a
training set by randomly selecting 1000 regions each of length 100,
200. 300.  . 1000. 2000. 3000.  . 10000. 20000. 30000.  . 100000.

200 000, 300 000,  1000 000 nt, i.e. a total of 37000 fragments. We
made sure these genomic regions did not overlap to avoid redundant
training data. The complete set of training data is available from the
FACIL (Fast and Accurate genetic Code Inference and Logo) web site:
http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/FACIL/input/complete_training_table.txt.gz.

2.2 Random Forest analysis

Random forest (RF) is a non-parametric classiﬁcation algorithm that uses
many classiﬁcation trees in parallel (Breiman, 2001). It uses a random subset
of the cases in the training dataset and the remainder of the cases for testing
and calculating the accuracy scores. The randomForest R package version
2.11.0 was used with 100 trees (using 1000 trees gave almost the same results,
see tab in Supplementary Table 1) and default parameters (63% of codons
used for training, 37% for testing, square root of the number of variables
to train individual trees). In FACIL, the RFs assess the correctness of the
homology-based predictions: the response variables of RF1 and RF2 were
‘stop codon’ or ‘coding codon’, the response of RF3 was either ‘correct AA
translation” or ‘incorrect AA translation”.

2.3 Globobulimina pseudospinescens sequencing and
assembly

Approximately 10000 single-cell G.pseud0spinescens organisms were
isolated by hand from Gullmar Fjord sediment (Risgaard-Petersen at al.,
2006). After washing, total DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA
Micro Kit and sequenced by Illumina Genome Analyser 11. Using Edena
(Hernandez 21 al., 2008), 9950 730 32 nt reads were assembled with
parameters m: 16 and M: 16, which yielded the highest N50 value
(N502170). The raw data and assembly are available from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE26664. The total
DNA of a eukaryote may contain up to three different translation codes
(De Grey, 2005): nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid (if the organism is
photosynthetic, but this is not the case for G.pseud0spinescens). To avoid
mixing these signals, the user can choose to feed individual contigs
to FACIL, but this might lead to a bad genetic code prediction due
to shortage of data. Thus, we selected those contigs that were likely
derived from the G.pseud0spinescens mitochondrial genome as follows.
The 8456 assembled contigs were queried by BlastX version 2.2.22+
(Camacho et al., 2009) against all proteins encoded by completely sequenced
mitochondria, downloaded from NCBI organelle genome resources
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesHome.cgi?taxid=2759) on
July 28, 2010. Importantly, we used the standard genetic code for this BlastX
search in order not to impose a bias in the genetic code on the contigs and
our results. The 150 contigs with a high-scoring BlastX hit (E-Value 5 0.01)
were considered to be of mitochondrial origin (average length 223 nt, median
length 191 nt). These sequences are available as ‘example’ input data on
the FACIL web server. They contain fragments of mitochondrial genes like
cytochrome B and several ATP synthase, cytochrome-c oxidase and NADH
dehydrogenase subunits. We found no evidence for multiple copies (e.g. a
nuclear and a mitochondrially encoded copy) of the encoded genes after a
BlastN search (E-Value 5 0.01) of the contigs against themselves.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Homology-based prediction

We present FACIL, a method to predict and evaluate the coding
of every codon for any nucleic acid sequence, without requiring a
priori annotation of proteins. First, FACIL queries all Pfam-fs protein
domain hidden markov model (HMMs) [local alignment models
(Finn et al., 2010)] against a provisional six-frame translation of the
DNA. All known variant codes differ by at most a few codons, so
a provisional translation can help to align the AAs in the protein

domains to the codons in the DNA. By default, our provisional
translation uses the standard code, but by iterating FACIL, using
the newly identiﬁed codes as input, it is in principle possible to
ﬁnd more distant codes. Stop codons are translated as X to enable
the initial alignment of all sites by hmmsearch (HMMER 3.0,
http://hmmer.org; default parameters and Pfam trusted score cutoff;
Fig. 1a). This sensitive proﬁle-based homology search algorithm
allows FACIL to identify homologous regions even if codons are
consistently mis-translated. Thus, potentially unique codes can be
identiﬁed even for organisms that are taxonomically divergent from
known species, provided that homologous domains are found. For
each codon, FACIL examines which AAs are most frequently
associated to it among the aligned protein domains, taking into
account the frequency distribution of AAs per position as deﬁned by
the domain HMMs. Because we use protein domains as the search
unit and the HMMER 3.0 hmmsearch algorithm is fast, FACIL
is extremely fast and insensitive to fragmented DNA, frameshifts
due to, e.g. sequencing or assembly errors, introns and split gene
sequences, and does not require gene annotation.

3.2 RF-based evaluation of homology-based prediction

The homology-based prediction creates a matrix of 64 codons by 20
AAs for each DNA molecule (Fig. 1b), where we consider the AA
that most frequently aligns to a codon within the protein domains
as its most likely translation. The 83.3% of the AAs thus predicted
are correct (Fig. 2), but stop codons (that do not align to the protein
domains) may be over-predicted for short sequences with strong
codon bias, causing a low precision of 24.0% for stop codons.
Also, AAs with similar properties may align to a codon with almost
equal frequencies, due to neutral evolution at the protein level (see
ATA in Fig. 1d). All in all, this leads to relatively low precision
and sensitivity scores (see Supplementary Table 2: precision: 83.3
and 24.0%, sensitivity: 83.3 and 89.6%, for AAs and stop codons,
respectively). We expected that these errors can be identiﬁed by
inspecting the variables relating to the homology-based prediction
(Table 1). To quantify the reliability of the predictions and assess
which parameters are important to achieve a reliable prediction,
we implemented a RF approach (Fig. 10). RF is a non-parametric
classiﬁcation algorithm capable of integrating many variables, yet
difﬁcult to overtrain due to the use of many classiﬁcation trees
in parallel that each are trained with a subset of the training data
(Breiman, 2001). RFs can even capture subclasses in the training
data: clusters of instances with a speciﬁc variable importance.

For every DNA sequence, we evaluate a range of variables for
each of the 64 codons to estimate the conﬁdence of the homology-
based prediction (Table 1). First, we include general variables of the
DNA fragment including sequence length and the total occurrence
of the codon in the sequence. Second, we include variables of the
identiﬁed protein domains like the average hmmsearch hit score.
Third, we include variables relating to the predicted genetic code
(e.g. the number of AAs missing from the predicted genetic code,
the number of codons never aligned to protein domains), variables
that represent the conﬁdence of the homology-based prediction [e.g.
the similarity between the two top-scoring AAs as deﬁned by their
BLOSUM62 substitution score (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992)] and
variables that relate to the robustness of the predicted genetic code
(number of single mutation codons translated to the same AA).
Finally, we include several combined parameters, including the

fraction of codons occurring in frame within the protein domains
over their occurrence in the entire DNA sequence.

We trained three RFs of 100 trees, each specialized to answer
a speciﬁc question. RF1 (91.03% accuracy) and RF2 (99.95%
accuracy) were designed to discern stops from coding codons
among those codons that do not and do align to protein domains,
respectively. RF3 (95.08% accuracy) predicts whether the AA that
most frequently aligns to a codon is indeed its correct translation.
The assessment of the homology-based predictions by these RFs
increased the precision and sensitivity scores (see Supplementary
Table 2: precision: 97.1 and 99.3%, sensitivity: 88.1 and 75.8%,
for AAs and stop codons, respectively). The decrease in sensitivity
for stop codons is mainly due to the many training cases where
not all codons are present in the protein domain alignments, e.g.

for short input sequences. Thus, RF1 is strict in accepting them as
true stop codons. We recommend to be critical of potentially novel
alternative ‘rare coding codons’, especially when analyzing short
input sequences. Note that these are cases where FACIL will not
predict an AA translation, as the codon is not aligned to any protein
domain.

We found different variables to be important to each of these
questions. For codons that are never aligned to protein domains,
the most important variable to distinguish true stop codons from
rare coding codons (RF1) is how many of the 64 possible codons
did not align to any protein domain. If the sequence contains many
codons that never align to a protein domain, this is likely a result of
a combination of the low number of identiﬁed protein domains, the
short length or the low complexity of the query sequence, although
individually, those parameters were less important to RF1. Among
codons that do align to protein domains, coding codons can be
distinguished from spuriously aligned stop codons (RF2) by their
occurrence ratio in-frame within protein domains and in the entire
sequence. This includes off-frame occurrence in the coding region,
where it has been hypothesized that stop codons are abundant to
terminate frame-shifted translation (Seligmann and Pollock, 2004).
To determine if the AA with the highest alignment score is indeed the
correct coding translation for a codon (RF3), the difference between
the ﬁrst and second best alignment score is an important variable.
Interestingly, however, the most important variable in RF3 turns out
to be a basic characteristic of the genetic code, i.e. the translation
redundancy at the third nucleotide of the codon. The genetic code is
characterized by a low impact of wobble base pairing of tRNAs at
the third nucleotide and apparently, spuriously high-scoring AAs can
be recognized as being in violation with this rule. Note that, e.g. the
amount of protein-coding sequence falling into Pfam domains is

not an important distinguishing variable in any of the RFs. Its
major contribution is in RF1, which is in accordance with the most
important RF1 variable, i.e. the number of codons that did not align
to any protein domain.

To assess potentially conﬂicting variable importance between
stande and alternative codons, we did an additional experiment
where we trained the RFs for each of these groups separately (see
tabs in Supplementary Table 1). While the variable importances for
the RFs trained with only standard codons were very comparable
with the complete set, the RFs trained with alternatively encoded
codons gave a different picture. For alternative codons that are
never aligned to protein domains, the most important variable to
distinguish true stop codons from rare coding codons (RF1) is
the percentage of strongly paired nucleic acids (GC content). This
reﬂects the difﬁculty in predicting alternative genetic codes for
genomes with a high GC-skew. For alternative codons that do
align to protein domains, RF2 assigns the highest importance to
the difference in alignment score between the ﬁrst and second
most frequently aligned AA. To determine if the AA assigned
by homology is indeed the correct coding translation (RF3), the
translation redundancy at the ﬁrst nucleotide of the codon is the
most important distinguishing variable. This analysis pinpoints
some of the speciﬁc variables that are important for the prediction
of alternative codons.

3.3 Genetic Code Logo and web server

The output of FACIL, i.e. a predicted translation for each codon
along with conﬁdence values based on the supporting fraction
of decision trees in the RFs, is visualized in a Genetic Code
Logo (Fig. Id). We implemented FACIL into a web server
(www.cmbi.ru.nl/FACIL/) that enables the user to easily obtain a
code prediction with details and a Genetic Code Logo for any
sequenced genome or set of contigs. This site also contains a
downloadable stand-alone version of the software. Both the web
server and the stand-alone version of FACIL take FASTA formatted
DNA sequences as input and allow the user to specify the genetic
code used for the provisional translation.

3.4 Mitochondrial genetic code of Globobulimina
pseudospinescens

Alternative genetic codes are perhaps most abundant in
mitochondrial genomes. To illustrate the use of our method, we
set out to decipher the genetic code of the mitochondrial genome
of the foraminifer G. pseudospinescens. Foraminifera belong to the
Rhizaria, a kingdom with only very few protein sequences in the
databases, none of which are derived from a mitochondrial genome.
This means that no close relatives of this species are represented
in the Pfam-fs protein domains used in FACIL. Moreover, the

data are particularly challenging, as the genome sequence is
highly fragmented and incomplete (150 contigs with an average
length of 223 nt). Nevertheless, we obtain strong support that the
G.pseud0spinescens mitochondrial genome uses the ‘Protozoan
Mitochondrial Code’ (NCBI translation table 4, see Fig. 1d and
Supplementary Fig. 1), with all 62 high-conﬁdence AA translations
correctly classiﬁed by RF3, including the alternative translation
of TGA into tryptophan (W). Both stop codons (TAA and TAG)
were identiﬁed by RF1 (red line). BlastX searches and manual
curation are consistent with these results (Supplementary Dataset 1
and Supplementary Table 4). Running the 8306 remaining contigs
(average length 168 nt) through FACIL predicted the ‘Standard
Code’ (NCBI translation table 1) as the most similar code, with
63 of the 64 codons predicted correctly. In the homology step,
ATG was more often aligned to leucine (L) than to methionine
(M; see Supplementary Fig. 2), but that translation was considered
unreliable by RF3 and ﬁltered out. TGA was identiﬁed as a stop
codon. This analysis exempliﬁes the value of our method for the
reliable discovery of code variants, even in fragmented DNA from
taxonomically divergent organisms.

3.5 Performance

As explained above, a FACIL query consists of two main steps.
The ﬁrst is a homology search where the six-frame translation of
the input sequences are queried for known protein domains by
hmmsearch (Fig. 1a), the second is an evaluation of the alignment-
based predictions by three specialized RFs (Fig. 10). For the 150
G.pseud0spinescens sequences (length ~223 nt) presented as an
example, these steps take approximately 4 and 1 min, respectively,
on our current web server (3 GHz, 32 GB memory). This brings
the total run time for prediction of the genetic code to 5 min, only
a fraction of the 50 min required for a BlastX search against the
proteins in the NCBI Refseq protein database on the same machine
(E-value £0.01; Supplementary Dataset 1). Indeed, the main
performance gain of FACIL comes from the difference in database
size that it queries. FACIL only needs to go through 9318 Pfam-
fs proﬁles, whereas the BlastX-based analysis queries at least the
Refseq database (9 004 816 proteins in the December 2010 version
we used) and preferably even non-redundant protein database,
especially for less well-characterized organisms. Moreover, the
BlastX results need to be parsed by a custom script and simply
selecting the most often aligned AA for each codon may lead
to errors, e.g. the two stop codons are occasionally aligned in
BlastX hits (Supplementary Table 4). The RFs in FACIL ﬁlter
out these cases. For large-scale datasets, great improvement may
be expected by running hmmsearch in parallel on a high-speed
hardware accelerator.

4 DISCUSSION

Currently, there is no stande available for inference of the genetic
code of an unannotated DNA sequence, and a range of ad hoc
methods that lack quality control and reported reliability scores
obscure this research area [the notable exception being Gendecoder
(Abascal et al., 2006)]. With FACIL, we present an easy, fast and
reliable tool to predict the genetic code for nucleic acid sequences
that does not depend on any a priori gene annotation. FACIL detects

alternative genetic codes even in species distantly related to known
organisms.

Previously, genetic code prediction has explicitly [Gendecoder
(Abascal et al., 2006)] or implicitly (BlastX searches) beneﬁted from
phylogenetic relatedness for reliable predictions. With FACIL, we
chose to rely on general protein domains for two reasons. First, this
eliminates the requirement to know the taxonomic placement of the
organism from which the DNA was derived, which may in particular
be difﬁcult for early-branching organisms. Second, this greatly
improves its speed (see Section 3.5). Nevertheless, future genetic
code predictors may beneﬁt from a more phylogenetically balanced
selection of reference sequences, a proper model of evolution and
a probabilistic phylogenetic method that considers the AAs at
neighboring nodes of the tree and uses branch lengths to calculate
the probability of AAs at an unknown state node.

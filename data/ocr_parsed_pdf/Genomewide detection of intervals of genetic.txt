Abstract

Motivation: Genetic heterogeneity, the fact that several sequence variants give rise to the same
phenotype, is a phenomenon that is of the utmost interest in the analysis of complex phenotypes.
Current approaches for finding regions in the genome that exhibit genetic heterogeneity suffer
from at least one of two shortcomings: (i) they require the definition of an exact interval in the gen—
ome that is to be tested for genetic heterogeneity, potentially missing intervals of high relevance,
or (ii) they suffer from an enormous multiple hypothesis testing problem due to the large number
of potential candidate intervals being tested, which results in either many false positives or a lack
of power to detect true intervals.

Results: Here, we present an approach that overcomes both problems: it allows one to automatic—
ally find all contiguous sequences of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome that are
jointly associated with the phenotype. It also solves both the inherent computational efficiency
problem and the statistical problem of multiple hypothesis testing, which are both caused by the
huge number of candidate intervals. We demonstrate on Arabidopsis thaliana genome—wide asso—
ciation study data that our approach can discover regions that exhibit genetic heterogeneity and
would be missed by single—locus mapping.

Conclusions: Our novel approach can contribute to the genome—wide discovery of intervals that
are involved in the genetic heterogeneity underlying complex phenotypes.

1 Introduction

 

Genetic heterogeneity is the phenomenon that several distinct se—
quence variants may give rise to the same phenotype (Burrell et (11.,
2013); one refers to allelic heterogeneity if these variants are located
in the same gene, and to locus heterogeneity if they occur in several
distinct genes. This phenomenon is of the utmost importance to the
exploration of the genetic basis of complex phenotypes, as most
complex phenotypes have been found to be affected by numerous
loci, rather than a single locus (McClellan and King, 2010).

The common ways of computing associations between genotype
and phenotype are rather limited in their ability to detect genetic

heterogeneity. Standard genome—wide association studies (GWAS)
compute correlations between single genome positions, primarily
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the phenotype of inter—
est (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007). The smaller
the sample size and the more SNPs that are involved in a phenotype,
the less likely it is that genetic heterogeneity can be detected by this
type of single—locus mapping. Gene—based tests quantify whether or
not the number of sequence variants in one gene is enriched in cases
versus controls (Neale and Sham, 2004). Although this approach
does consider the combined effect of several SNPs, it is also restrict—
ive in the sense that it only checks entire genes for association. It will

miss any variants that lead to genetic heterogeneity, but are not
located in or near the same gene.

Besides these two standard approaches to GWAS, many regres—
sion—based models for associating phenotype and genotype have
been proposed, such as Lasso models (e.g. Kim et al., 2009).
Although they are not limited to a single SNP or gene and thereby
assess all possible loci at once, these models are limited in the sense
that they cannot provide a measure of statistical significance for
their findings on the level of sets of SNPs. At best, these models may
provide a P—value that quantifies the probability that a certain SNP
contributes to the phenotypic variance. But they cannot account for
the inherent multiple hypothesis testing problem that is created by
checking arbitrary contiguous intervals in the genome for genetic
heterogeneity, let alone arbitrary sets of remote genetic loci.

The scale of this multiple testing problem in genetic heterogen—
eity search can be illustrated as follows: when considering all
possible intervals in a genome in a dataset with 106 SNPs, the num—
ber of tests one performs is quadratic in the number of SNPs in the
genome, i.e. approximately 5 X 1011 candidate intervals. When
ignoring the multiple testing problem, one will obtain billions of
false positives. If one performs the standard Bonferroni correction
(Bonferroni, 1936), which divides the significance threshold or
(typically 0.05 or 0.01) by the number of tests, then the corrected
threshold will be so low that hardly any finding will be statistically
significant.

We propose an algorithm for genome—wide detection of con—
tiguous intervals that may exhibit genetic heterogeneity with re—
spect to a given binary phenotype. More specifically, we search for
genomic intervals in which the occurrence of at least one type of
sequence variant (e.g. a point mutation or minority allele) is sig—
nificantly more frequent in one of the two phenotypic classes. The
fact that the sequence variant may occur at any SNP within the
interval allows us to detect genetic heterogeneity in this manner.
Our algorithm automatically finds the starting and end positions
of these intervals, while properly correcting for multiple hypothesis
testing and preserving statistical power. Central to this algorithm
is an approach by Tarone (1990), which allows one to reduce the
Bonferroni correction factor for multiple testing. We employ our
novel algorithm on 21 binary phenotypes from Arahidopsis thali-
ana and discover intervals of SNPs in the Arahidopsis genome that
are associated with 14 of these phenotypes, but could not be found
with previous methods.

2 Approach

We will first state our problem formally, then provide the necessary
background on statistical association testing and the multiple testing
problem, before presenting our approach to genetic heterogeneity
detection.

2.1 Problem statement: significant interval search

We are given a set of n individuals classified into two phenotypic
groups, n1 cases and n2 controls (Fig. 1). Each individual is
represented by an ordered sequence of L binary genotypes. The
sequence of binary genotypes can represent binary SNPs in a homo—
zygous setting or, more generally, a dominant/recessive encoding in
a heterozygous setting.

Our goal is to find all genomic intervals, such that the occur-
rence of at least one genotype encoded as l (for instance, a minor
allele or recessive genotype) within in each of these intervals is statis-
tically significantly associated with the occurrence of a phenotype of
interest.

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the problem of detecting genomic intervals
that may exhibit genetic heterogeneity

The intervals found are promising candidates for regions of gen—
etic heterogeneity underlying phenotypic variation and should be
functionally investigated.

More formally, we are given a dataset {(s,,y,-)},'-‘:1 where s,- is
the binary sequence of length L representing the i—th individual and
y,- 6 {Cases, Controls} is its corresponding binary phenotype.
Each 5,- can itself be represented as an L—dimensional vector
5,- : (5,-[0], 5,-[1], . . . ,s,[L — 1]) with binary entries s,]j] 6 {0,1}. We
denote the interval (1, l) of length lstarting at index I of a sequence
5,- as s,[r;l] : (s,-[r],s,-[r + 1], . . . ,s,[r + l —  There are A?) pos—
sible intervals aswevary l : 1, . . . ,L and r : 0,...,L — l.

Finally, let g(s,-[r; 1]) be a binary random variable defined as
g(s,-[r;l]) : 5,-[1] V 5,-[r + 1] V . . . V 5,-[r + l — 1], where V denotes the
binary OR operator. Note that g(s,-[r;l]) takes value 1 if the subse—
quence s,[r; l] contains at least one non—zero entry and value 0 other—
wise. Intuitively, g(s,-[r;l]) indicates whether the i—th individual has
one or more minor alleles in the genomic region determined by the
interval (ml) or not.

The problem we solve in this article is that of finding all intervals
(:1) with l: 1,...,L and T: 0,...,L —l such that the random
variable g(s[r; l]) is statistically associated with the phenotype y after
correction for multiple hypothesis testing.

2.2 Statistical background

2.2.1 Statistical model

For each interval (ml), the data {g(s,-[r;l]), y,-}:-‘:1 can be arranged
in the form of a 2 X 2 contingency table:

 

 

Variables g(s[‘r; l]) = 1 g(s[‘r; l]) = 0 Row totals
y = Cases an; 711 — an] n1

y = Controls xnl — an; 712 — (961,1 — “ell "2

Col. totals x171 ’1 — er 7’

 

By the definition of g(s[r;l]), xrﬁl is the number of individuals in
the dataset which have one or more minor alleles within the genomic
interval (1, 1). Similarly, at”; has the same interpretation but re—
stricted only to cases.

In this article, the strength of the association between the pheno—
type y and the random variables g(s[r;l]) will be evaluated using
Fisher’s exact test (Fisher, 1922). We denote the P—value obtained by
applying Fisher’s exact test to the 2 X 2 contingency table corres—
ponding to the genomic interval (1, l) as pr”). An interval (1, I) will be
deemed to be significantly associated with the phenotype if pr”, 3 5,
with 5 being the corrected significance threshold.

Our work can be readily extended to use other test statistics instead
of Fisher’s exact test such as, for instance, the xz—test (Pearson, 1900).

2.2.2 Multiple hypothesis testing

To solve the significant interval search problem we must perform a
statistical association test such as Fisher’s exact test for each of the
# possible intervals (I, l). This means that for usual values of L
in the order of 105 or 106, tens or hundreds of billions of hypotheses
are being tested simultaneously.

This creates a challenging multiple hypothesis testing problem
which would result in a crippling amount of false positives if mul—
tiple testing is not taken into account. Therefore, in this article, we
chose to focus on approaches which strictly control the Family Wise
Error Rate (FWER), defined as the probability of generating one or
more false positives.

FWER control requires using testing procedures which guarantee
that FWER S or with or being the desired significance level. To this
end, one usually chooses the corrected significance threshold 5 ap—
propriately. Ideally, the optimal 5* would be obtained by solving the
following optimization problem

5* : max {5]FWER(5) g or},

as it would yield the highest power, i.e. the probability of detecting
true positives, while still strictly controlling the FWER.

However, since evaluating FWER(5) in closed form is not pos—
sible in general, the most popular approaches resort to sub—optimal
solutions. For instance, the well—known Bonferroni correction
(Bonferroni, 1936) is equivalent to simplifying the original problem
by using the bound FWER(5) 3 5D, where D is the total number of
statistical association tests being performed. When 5D is used in—
stead of FWER(5) in the optimization problem above, it leads to the

*

well—known correction 5hon

: or/ D. Despite being popular due to its
simplicity, the Bonferroni correction is often overly conservative,
i.e. FWER(5:OH) << 5fmnD in practice. More importantly, in our

setup where D : A?)

is a huge number, the Bonferroni correction
is too severely under—powered.

An alternative to the lack of power of the Bonferroni correction
is to use permutation—testing methods, such as the Westfall—Young
(WY) permutation testing procedure (Westfall and Young, 1993), to
empirically estimate FWER(5).

In WY permutation testing, we generate a resampled dataset by
randomly permuting the class labels with respect to the individuals,
obtaining a new dataset in which no interval is statistically associated
with the (permuted) class labels. Then we compute the minimum

P—value across all #

intervals, pm,“ : min(r,[)pr,[, and compare it
with 5. If pm,“ > 5, then no interval is significant and there are no false
positives in the resampled dataset; otherwise there are one or more

false positives. If we repeat this a sufficiently large number of times ],

an empirical estimate of the FWER as

where II[-] takes value 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise. The

optimization problem can then be estimated as the or—quantile of the

the power limitation of the Bonferroni correction by empirically esti—

mating the high—dimensional dependence structure of the P—values for

al intervals, the computational effort required to compute

 is unfeasible for reasonable values of ], say 103 or 104.
Although proving theoretically that the WY permutation—testing pro—
cedure achieves strong FWER control is challenging, often requiring
the assumption of hard—to—verify technical conditions such as the sub-
set pivotality condition, permutation—based testing is widely applied
in computational biology as empirical evidence often suggests that
strong FWER control is in fact achieved.

Next, we review the concept of the minimum attainahle P-value
for discrete test statistics, which we will extensively exploit in our

contribution.

2.2.3 The concept of minimum attainable P-value

Tarone was the first to discuss in (Tarone, 1990) the existence of a
minimum attainable P—value when discrete test statistics, such as
Fisher’s exact test, are used. The idea is simple: since the test statistic
is discrete, it can only take a finite set of values and there exists a
minimum attainable P—value strictly greater than 0. As Tarone
showed, one can exploit that to obtain an improved Bonferroni cor—
rection factor which exhibits a great increase in statistical power in
many cases of interest.

In the context of 2 X 2 contingency tables, a large class of test
statistics considers the table margins x171, n1 and n2 to be constant
and, as a consequence, knowing the value of one of the four inner
cell counts determines the value of the other three, i.e. the table has
a single degree of freedom. Relevant examples are Fisher’s exact
test, the xz—test and the Cochran—Mantel—Haenszel test (Mantel and
Haenszel, 1959), among others. If we choose at”) as the cell count of
reference (regardless of which of the four cell counts is chosen as the
independent random variable one obtains exactly the same results,
thus, we use at”) without loss of generality), then
at) E {amim . . . ,amax} where am,“ : max(0,x,,[ — n2) and
amax : min(x,,,, n1) are the minimum and maximum possible values
of the cell count at”) consistent with the table margins. Thus, there
are at most amax — “min + 1 different attainable values for the
test statistic and corresponding P—values. One can then compute
the minimum attainable P—value as ‘I’(xr,,, n1,n2) : min
{prﬁl(arﬁl,xrﬁl,n1,n2)]ar,[ E [amrmamax]}. (In our setup, the table mar—

ginals n1 and n2 are constant for all #

intervals and only the
margin x171 depends on the interval (1, l). Thus, we omit the depend—
ence of ‘I’(x,71, n1 , n2) on n1 and n2 from now on.)

The concept of the minimum attainable P—value ‘I’(x,ﬁ,) has pro—
found implications for multiple hypothesis testing problems involv—
ing discrete test statistics. Intuitively, it quantifies the strongest
association that we could ever observe just based on the table mar—
gins. When applied to the significant interval search problem, if ‘I’(
x171) > 5 then we know that the interval (1, l) can never be significant
regardless of the actual value of at”). More importantly, when test
statistics are used which consider the table margins fixed, one can
prune those intervals from the search space without affecting the
FWER.

More formally, we define 17(5) : { (r,l)]‘I’(x(r, l)) S 5} as the
set of testahle intervals at corrected significance level 5. All inter—
vals which are not in 17(5) can never achieve significance at level 5
and are thus called non-testahle at that level. The FWER at signifi—
cance level 5 can then be upper bounded by 5]IT(5)], motivating
the following procedure to find the corrected significance thresh—
old 5*:

Like the Bonferroni correction, Tarone’s method also ignores the
dependence structure between test statistics, thus being less powerful

than permutation—based testing approaches. On the other hand, by
exploiting the discreteness of the test statistic, it has greatly
increased statistical power when compared with a standard
Bonferroni correction. The method as proposed by Tarone had to be
solved by a brute—force approach requiring computation of the min—
imum attainable P—values for every single test. When a very large
number of tests have to be performed, that is unfeasible due to the
daunting computational complexity involved. Nonetheless, by care—
fully designing context—dependent pruning techniques, Tarone’s
method was successfully applied recently to association rule mining
(Minato et al., 2014; Terada et al., 2013) and graph mining
(Sugiyama et al., 2015).

However, all of those approaches cannot work directly with the
exact minimum attainable P—value function  Instead, they used
a surrogate function  which greatly overestimates the potential
for significance when the margin x is close to n. Since that situation
is commonly encountered in the significant interval search problem,
especially for sufficiently large intervals, the existing methods can—
not be readily extended to our task.

Next, we present our contribution: two alternative algorithms to
solve the significant interval search problem by making use of the
exact minimum attainable P—value; one based on Tarone’s method
and another on WY permutation testing.

2.3 Our approach: significant interval search with fast
automatic interval search and FAIS—WY

Here, we describe the Fast Automatic Interval Search (FAIS) algo—
rithm and its Westfall—Young—based counterpart, FAIS—WY. Both
methods exploit the concept of minimum attainable P—value re—
viewed in Section 2.2.3 along with a novel pruning technique to ob—
tain a corrected significance threshold 5* for the significant interval
search problem. However, their exact goal differs: FAIS provides a
computationally efficient way to apply Tarone’s method to the sig—
nificant interval search problem whereas FAIS—WY makes applying
the WY permutation testing procedure to the significant interval

The main body of FAIS and FAIS—WY is presented as Algorithm 1,

which emphasizes the common structure between both methods. The

general idea is to initialize the tentative corrected significance threshold
5 to the largest possible value such that all intervals are initially testable.
Intervals (r, l) are then sequentially enumerated in increasing order of
length and, if they are testable at the current level 5, they are processed
leading to an adjustment of 5 to ensure that the respective FWER—
related target is satisfied: 5]17(5)] g or for FAIS and FWER(5) g or,
with FWER(5) estimated via WY—permutations for FAIS—WY. Finally,
intervals are pruned from the search space, if possible.

Therefore, we need to have an efficient way to check whether an
interval (r,l) is testable and a way to determine when all intervals
containing the current interval (r,l) can be pruned from the search
space. We address each of those points next.

2.3.1 Testability

Let 350,51, ..., 59]} be the image of  sorted in a monotonic—
ally
ent values because  is symmetric around n/2 (Fig. 2). Now,
we define the testahle region 2(5) as the set 2(5) C [0,n] such that
x,,; 6 2(5) <:> (r, l) 617(5). In other words, the interval (1, l) is
testable at level 5 if and only if the margin x,,; of interval (1, 1) be—

ecreasing sequence. Notice that there are only  + 1 differ—

longs to 2(5). Two important properties of the testable regions
2(5) are:

PROPERTY 1: V5 E [5;,, 5;,_1),1-T(5) 2 17(5),) :> 2(5) 2 2(5;,) E 2;,

PROPERTY 2: (i) if 5;, < ‘I’( the region 2k is the union of
two symmetric intervals, i.e. 2;, : [cries] U [n — 65m — of]; (ii) if
5;, 2 ‘I’( the region is composed of a single interval,
2;, : [Gin — Ck].

Property 1 states that, since  attains only  + 1 different
values, there are only  + 1 different sets of testable intervals
17(5) and corresponding testable regions 2(5). Thus, it suffices to
consider only the  + 1 cases corresponding to 50,51, ...,5m

defined above, with testable regions 2(5;,) E 2;,. 2

Property 2, along with the symmetry of ‘I’(x), implies that the re—
gions 2(5;,) are easy to describe and can in fact be computed by
starting from 2(50) : [0,n] and iteratively ‘shrinking’ them to ob—
tain 2(5;,) from 2(5;,_1). The computational complexity of each
such step is negligible (0(1)). The two different shapes that testable
regions 2;, can take are described in Figure 2.

In summary, to check if an interval (r,l) is testable at level
5 E [5;,, 5;,_1) one just needs to check if x,,; E 2;, or not.

2.3.2 Pruning
We exploit the following fact: intervals (I’ , l’ ) containing the interval
(1,1) have margins x”: 2 x13]. Thus, if the interval (1, l) is non—test—
able and x,,; > n — of, no interval containing it can be testable and
we can prune the search space. Notice that an interval (1, l) can be
non—testable, i.e. x17; ¢ 2;,, and yet the search space will not be
pruned if x,,; < n — of.
Thus, if we enumerate intervals in increasing order of length,
every time an interval with x,,; > n — of is found to be non—testable,
any other interval which contains it can be deemed to be non—test—
able too without needing to inspect it.

2.3.3 Detailed description of the pseudocode

Next, we describe in greater detail the pseudocode common to FAIS
and FAIS—WY in Algorithm 1 in order to discuss the specific aspects
of each of the two algorithms.

Initialization: In Line 2 the variables specific to FAIS or
FAIS—WY are initialized. Key to the enumeration procedure is the
variable intervalqueue, which is initialized in Line 3 by pushing
all length 1 intervals. Finally, the tentative corrected significance
threshold is initialized to 5 : 51, which is the largest value that 
can take other than the trivial value 50 : 1, and the corresponding
testability region 2;, and its left—most point of is obtained.

Enumeration process: Between lines 5 and 15 one finds the core
of the algorithm; a while loop which analyzes the intervals con—
tained in the queue one by one, iteratively adding new intervals
which cannot be pruned to the queue during the process. The loop
naturally stops once the queue becomes empty.

Within the loop, first of all, the interval (1, l) located at the head
of the queue is popped (Line 6). The values of the random variable g
(s;[r; l]) are then evaluated for all n individuals, and the correspond—
ing margin x,,; is computed (Lines 7 and 8). Next, in Line 9, one
checks if the interval (1, l) is testable at the current corrected signifi—
cance level 5;,. If xrﬁj¢2;,, then the interval is not testable and does
not need to be processed. In contrast, if x,,; E 2;,, the interval is test—
able at the current significance threshold 5;z and we must process it,
appropriately decreasing 5;z and shrinking 2;,, thus also decreasing
n — of. How that processing step is made is what sets FAIS and
FAIS—WY apart algorithmically and statistically and will be dis—
cussed later.

Finally, pruning occurs in Line 12. We know that if either
the current interval being processed (1,l) or the preceding interval
(1 — 1, l) are non—testable with margin x > n — of, then the interval
(1 — 1, l + 1) cannot possibly be testable and does not need to be ap—
pended to the queue of intervals to be processed. Note also that if ei—
ther interval (1, l) or interval (1 — 1,l) had been previously pruned
due to this criteria, interval (1 — 1,l + 1) will be pruned too. In other
words, pruning propagates from shorter intervals to longer length
intervals containing them. As n — of decreases as intervals are pro—
cessed, the algorithm naturally ends after all testable intervals at the
final 5* have been enumerated.

FAIS specific functions: In Algorithm 2, we describe how FAIS
processes the testable intervals. The key idea is to keep an n+ 1—
dimensional vector of counters c, originally initialized with all zero
entries, such that c]k] is the number of intervals processed so far
which had xrﬁ; : [2. Thus, szzkcpc] equals the number of testable
intervals at the corrected significance threshold 5;, found so far.

Every time a new testable interval (1, l) is found, the correspond—
ing counter c[x,,;] is increased by one making the improved
Bonferroni bound (szzkc[x])5;, increase too. If the bound is still
lower than or, nothing needs to be done. However, when it becomes

larger, we know that the current testability threshold 5;, is too large.
Thus, in line 7, we increase la, reducing 5;, and effectively shrinking
the testability region 2;z until the condition (szzkc[x])5;, g or is
satisfied again.

This approach is well—defined mainly due to two properties
of the FWER estimator: (i) if the significance threshold 5;, re—
mains fixed, inspecting a new interval can never make FWER(5;,)
decrease; and (ii) FWER(5) can be evaluated exactly for all 5 g 5;,
using only the set of intervals satisfying x17; 6 2;,. Thanks to those
two properties, the algorithm follows an iterative cycle of interval
enumeration, FWER estimation and significance threshold adjust—
ment which continues until all intervals belonging to a certain 2;,.
have been enumerated. Finally, 5* can be obtained as the or—quantile

version of Algorithm 1 so that 5;, in Line 4 is directly initialized to

ing to Fisher’s exact test and outputs those intervals such that

not change along the execution of the algorithm.

2.3.5 Filtering of overlapping significant intervals

Due to the way the problem is formulated, it is common to
have clusters of overlapping significant intervals which introduce re—
dundancy in the findings. As a post—processing step, only the most
significant interval in the cluster, i.e. the one with the smallest
P—value, is kept. As the most significant interval is guaranteed to be
kept by this post—processing scheme, the FWER is unchanged
and thus the computation of the significance threshold 5* is un—
affected. We illustrated this filtering process in Figure
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

3 Experiments

We evaluate the ability of FAIS and FAIS—WY to detect genome—
wide contiguous intervals that may exhibit genetic heterogeneity on
simulated data as well as on data from an association mapping study
in Arabidopsis thaliana. As benchmarks, we use BRUTE, the ‘brute
force’ method using the Bonferroni correction, BRUTE—WY, the
Westfall—Young version of BRUTE, and UFE, the univariate Fisher’s
Exact Test, which only checks for a significant difference in single
SNPs.

3.1 Results on simulated data
In this simulation study two aspects of our algorithm are investi—
gated, (a) its accuracy, and (b) its speed. The protocol used for the
construction of simulated datasets is identical in both cases.
Following the notation in Section 2.1, we have n binary se—
quences of length L, where the first n1 sequences have label y
: Cases and the remaining n2 have label y : Controls. Initially,
every entry 5,- of each sequence 5,- is sampled from a Bernoulli dis—
tribution with parameter p0, i.e.

SinINB(17PO)7 i:1rzr---nri:17---7L

so that s,- : 1 with probability p0, which is essentially the
background noise. We now prepare lmax significant intervals
(d, 1), (2d, 2), . . . , (dlmax, lmax) with d > lmax. In other words, the
parameter d is the (approximate) space between successive
significant intervals, and each sequence has a significant interval of
length 1 at position d, followed by a significant interval of length 2
starting from the position 2d, and so on. Then for every sequence
s,- (i : 1, 2, . . . ,n1) for the cases, elements in significant intervals s;[dl; l]
(l : 1, 2, . . . ,lmax) are replaced with new sequences such that the prob—
ability of at least one 1 occurring in each s;[dl; l] is equal to pcase. This is
achieved by sampling each element in s;[dl; l] from a Bernoulli distribu—
tion with parameter 1 — (1 — pcasef. The same procedure is performed
for the sequences 5,- (i : n1 + 1,n1 + 2,... ,n) for the controls using
pcon instead of page. With this setup, we set the length of each sequence
to beL : d - (lmax + 1).

3.1.1 Power and FWER

Recall that the statistical power is defined as 1 — [3, where [3 is the
Type II error, i.e. the probability of a false negative occurring. To in—
vestigate the power of FAIS, FAIS—WY, BRUTE and UFE, we run a

simulation with the following parameter settings: n1 : 100 cases, n2
: 100 controls,

d : 1000, lmax : 10, or : 0.05, po : 0.1, pcon : 0.2,

and we vary pcase from 0.2 to 0.9 to see how the power of the algo—
rithm varies with respect to changes in pcase. Note that pcase : 0.2
corresponds to the situation where there is no difference between
the cases and controls. Also note that BRUTE—WY is not considered
in this experiment because it will give the same results as FAIS—WY.
With these parameter choices, each sequence 5,- in the cases contains
10 significant intervals s;[1000;1], s;[2000; 2], . . . , s;[10000; 10].

Each algorithm runs over this simulated dataset and identifies a
list of significant intervals. These significant intervals are then
clustered according to overlapping sets of intervals and the most
significant interval is picked up as the representative in each cluster,
as discussed in Section 2.3.5. That way, we obtain the resulting list
of (disjoint) significant intervals—one for each overlapping
cluster—(If,lf) for i: 1,2, . . . ,M. If one of these intervals (ti-24*)
overlaps a true significant interval (dl, l), we say that (dl, l) has been
successfully detected. Otherwise if (If, l?) does not overlap any true
significant interval, then it is a false detection.

Results are shown in Figure 3. This shows that FAIS—WY has
more power than FAIS, which has significantly more power than
BRUTE, which in turn has significantly more power than UFE for
pcase in the range (0.4, 0.8). In the Supplementary Material,
Supplementary Figs S5 and S6 show that the increase in power is
similar for intervals of different lengths (except for UFE, which per—
forms poorly for longer intervals).

3.1.2 Running time comparisons

Figure 4 compares the runtimes of FAIS, FAI SWY, BRUTE and
BRUTE—WY for parameters n : 100 and ] : 100 (number of permuta—
tions) while varying the sequence length L. UFE is not included be—
cause it is simply linear in L. Note that the axes are log—scaled: for
L N 100000, FAIS—WY takes 26.56 5, while BRUTE takes 30 min and
BRUTE—WY takes ~ 24 h. Further experiments were done for varying
n and ] (Supplementary Material), which shows that the WY methods
are approximately linear in n and ]. Extrapolating from these values,
if] : 10000, then FAIS—WY would take ~ 40 min, while BRUTE—WY
would take ~ 100 days. Other simulations in the Supplementary
Material show that the runtime of FAIS and FAIS—WY scales ap—
proximately linearly in the number of cases and controls.

from the online resource easyGWAS (Grimm et al., 2012). This
dataset is a large collection of 107 continuous and dichotomous
phenotypes for at most 194 inbred lines and a total of 214 051
SNPs. All 21 dichotomous defense— and developmental—related
phenotypes were selected for further analysis (Table 1). Because the
genotypes are homozygous, we encoded the major allele as 0 and
the minor allele as 1. For this study, we did not apply a minor allele
frequency filtering. The significance level for FAIS/FAIs—WY and
all other methods was set to or : 0.05. We measured the extent of
population structure for each phenotype by computing the genomic
control inﬂation factor 7» using a logistic regression. Phenotypes in
Table 1 are ordered by increasing values of 7».

We ran two univariate association mapping methods to detect
single SNPs that are significantly associated with a given phenotype:
UFE Test and a state—of—the—art linear mixed model (FaSTLMM) to
account for confounding due to population structure (Lippert et al.,
2011). To estimate the genetic similarity between individuals in the
LMM we computed a realized relationship kinship matrix (Hayes
et al., 2009). We applied a Bonferroni correction to account for mul—
tiple hypothesis testing for these two methods. In Table 1, we re—
ported the number of significant hits detected by the two univariate

methods as well as the number of novel intervals detected by FAIS
and FAIS—WY. We configured the methods in such a way that only
intervals of length 2 or more are tested. For all methods, we
observed a clear trend of detecting more significantly associated
SNPs or intervals with increasing population structure (measured
using genomic control 7»). Note that this is even true when using a
LMM, which is able to account for confounding due to population
stratification. We further observed that FAIS detects a total of 57
intervals, whereas FAIS—WY detects a total of 217 intervals across
all 21 dichotomous phenotypes, which is on average 3.8 times more
intervals than detected by FAIS. FAIS —WY is able to detect more sig—
nificant intervals because it implicitly takes into account correlations
between SNPs and hence leads to a less stringent corrected signifi—
cance threshold, as shown in Supplementary Table S1.

Because our method cannot explicitly correct for confounding
due to population structure, we investigated how many of our sig—
nificant intervals contain or are in close proximity (10 kb up— or
down—stream) to a ‘confounded’ SNP—a SNP found to be signifi—
cantly associated by UFE (a UFE ‘hit’), but not found to be signifi—
cantly associated by a LMM, that is able to correct for population
structure. We used a 10 kb window since linkage disequilibrium
(LD) decays on average within 10 kb in Arabidopsis thaliana (Kim
et al., 2007). We found that only 6.9% (15 intervals) among all
significant intervals (217) were close to such a confounded SNP
(Fig. 5). Even for the phenotype with strongest population structure
(YEL), only one of the intervals contained such a confounded SNP
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Eventually, we excluded all intervals that
contained or were in close proximity to any significant hit found
with an UFE or a LMM. A set of 152 intervals, that is 70% of all de—
tected intervals, was left (Fig. 5 ). Those can be deemed as truly novel
intervals that cannot be detected with a univariate method.

are intervals that contain both, a hit (:10 kb) found with an UFE and a LMM

that do not contain a significant hit found by an UFE
(Supplementary Table S2)—referred to as noUFE filtering—and that
do not contain or are in close proximity to any significant hit found
with an UFE or a LMM—referred to as stringent filtering
(Supplementary Table S3).

For each of the bacterial pathogenesis factors in our dataset
(avrB, aerpm1, avrPhpB and aerptZ), the plant receptor that
mediates the defense response was previously known (Grant et al.,
1995, 1998; Mauricio et al., 2003; Warren et al., 1998; Yu et al.,
1993) and had also been detected in previous GWA studies
(Aranzana et al., 2005; Atwell et al., 2010). Under the noUFE filter—
ing, the most significant intervals for avrPhpB and aerptZ were
found in close proximity (<10 kb) to the corresponding R—genes
[RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE 5 (RPS5) and
RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE Z (RPSZ), re—
spectively]. The same was true for the lesioning phenotype, where
the most significant interval was found just upstream of the known
causal gene ACCELERATED CELL DEATH (ACD6) (Todesco
et al., 2010). All of these genes are known to have more than one al—
lele that is maintained across different lineages (Stahl et al., 1999;
Tian et al., 2002; Todesco et al., 2010). If these alleles arose inde—
pendently in different genetic backgrounds, individuals that share
the same allele would have different nearby polymorphisms. Thus,
these intervals of genetic heterogeneity might reﬂect close linkage to
a true causal polymorphism that is maintained by selection in differ—
ent lineages.

After filtering out intervals that were <10 kb from a previous
UFE or LMM hit (stringent filtering), the most significant inter—
val for the avrPhpB was found to be ~18 kb upstream of RPS5.
There is a cluster of genes encoding ﬂavin monooxygenase (FMO)
family proteins in this region and a member of this family,
FMOI, has previously been shown to be an important regulator of
R—gene—mediated defenses (Bartsch et al., 2006). Under these filter—
ing criteria, the most significant interval for aerptZ was found in a
region nearby two R—genes. For lesioning, the most significant inter—
val encoded a chloroquine resistance transporter, which was

previously shown to be important for resistance to Phytophthora
hrassicae (Maughan et al., 2010).

For all other phenotypes, the most significant interval did not
change between the noUFE and stringent filtering. For the avrB
phenotype, the most significantly associated interval contained
AT3G07195 (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3), a gene that encodes
a paralog of the negative immune system regulator RPM1
INTERACTING PROTEIN 4 (RIN4) (Liu et al., 2011; Mackey
et al., 2002). This interval was also identified in association with the
response to another bacterial pathogenesis factor, aerpm1 where it
was the second—most significant interval. Because both avrB and
aerpm1 are detected by the host immune receptor RESISTANCE
TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE PV MACULICOLA (Rpm1)
through modification of RIN4 (Belkhadir et al., 2004; Mackey
et al., 2002), it suggests a plausible role for this RIN4 paralog in
mediating natural variation in response to the activity of these bac—
terial virulence determinants.

We also found that two phenotypes that are not related to de—
fense had intervals that contained a cluster of two or more paralogs.
In the case of leaf rolling at 10 BC (Leaf roll 10), the most significant
interval covered a cluster of receptor—like proteins. For the lesioning
or yellowing phenotype (LY), there was a cluster of RING domain/
U—box proteins in the most significant interval. Thus, intervals
of genetic heterogeneity may reflect copy number variation or
rearrangements that are common features of paralog clusters
(reviewed in Zmienko et al. 2014).

For other phenotypes, the polymorphisms in the interval itself
may have a role in explaining the phenotype. The most significant
intervals for two of the phenotypes that indicated reduced chloro—
plast function (YEL and Chlorosis 22) contained a gene that
encoded a protein that was predicted to be localized to the
chloroplast.

Taken together, these results suggest that intervals of genetic het—
erogeneity associated with biological traits may result from (i) link—
age to an allele that is maintained independently in different
lineages, (ii) structural variation in the region or (iii) true genetic het—
erogeneity within a gene that is responsible for the phenotype.

4 Discussion and conclusion

We have presented an algorithm for detecting genomic intervals of
SNPs that may jointly explain the genetic heterogeneity underlying a
phenotype of interest. On data from Arabidopsis thaliana, we dis—
cover novel genomic regions that may be involved in the genetic het—
erogeneity of several defense and developmental phenotypes.

Our method improves the state of the art in two important ways:
First, it automatically finds the starting and ending positions of these
intervals in the genome, while current approaches require the defin—
ition of a fixed starting and ending point for each interval. Second,
despite the huge number of intervals that we are testing, we can
properly account for the resulting problem of multiple hypothesis test—
ing without losing statistical power, that is the ability to detect true
intervals. Hence, our algorithm combines in a unique way the ability
to efficiently mine the genome for intervals of genetic heterogeneity
with a proper way to measure the statistical significance of our
findings.

Our method is based on a number of assumptions, which should
be overcome in future work in order to further extend the applicabil—
ity of our method. First, we do not model confounders such as popu—
lation structure. That is, we do not account for the fact that there
may be distinct subpopulations of individuals in our sample (Lippert
et al., 2011). We envision extending our method in this direction by

conducting meta—analyses, that is searching significant intervals in
different subpopulations and then combining these results, e.g. via
the Cochran—Mantel—Haenszel test (Mantel and Haenszel, 1959),
while still accounting for multiple testing. Second, the method is
encoding—sensitive in the sense that changing the binary encoding of
a particular SNP will affect the results, and potentially lead to an
interval being missed. As in many multi—locus interaction models
(e.g. Kam—Thong et al., 2012), it is an open problem how to over—
come this coding—sensitivity, while retaining the computational effi—
ciency and statistical power of our current method.

Third, we here consider contiguous intervals of SNPs that exhibit
genetic heterogeneity, rather than arbitrary sets of SNPs anywhere
in the genome. This decision is based on the computational and stat—
istical consideration that the number of candidate sets is quadratic
in the number of SNPs in our setting, but exponential in the size of
the candidate sets in the general setting. Still, it is an important ques—
tion to ask whether our approach here can be extended to detect
groups of SNPs in gene pathways (Wang et al., 2010) that may ex—
plain the genetic heterogeneity of a given phenotype.

Based on our results, we propose three reasons that explain why
an interval of genetic heterogeneity is associated with a phenotype.
First, regions ﬂanking a locus that is under balancing selection ex—
hibit polymorphisms that are linked to the segregating alleles
(Hudson and Kaplan, 1988) and this can give rise to genetic hetero—
geneity that is associated with a phenotype that is governed by the
locus under selection. All three of the R—genes (Rpm1, Rps5 and
RpsZ) that govern the responses to the four bacterial pathogenesis
factors (avrB, aerpm1, avrPhpB and aerptZ) in our phenotype
dataset were previously found to be under balancing selection
(Mauricio et al., 2003; Stahl et al., 1999; Tian et al., 2002). We
found that at least one of the significant intervals of genetic hetero—
geneity for each of these bacterial pathogenesis factor phenotypes
was in the region ﬂanking the corresponding R—gene
(Supplementary Table S2). Because all of these phenotypes also had
a hit in previous UFE test or LMM GWAS for the cognate R—gene,
these intervals were filtered out under the no UFE criteria. The same
was true for the lesioning phenotype, where the most significant
interval that did not contain a significant hit found by an UFE was
near the causal ACD6 locus, which is also thought to be under bal—
ancing selection (Todesco et al., 2010). Thus, it is possible that inter—
vals of genetic heterogeneity that we detected for other phenotypes
in our dataset may also have resulted from linkage to a locus under
balancing selection that was previously missed by a univariate or
LMM approach.

Second, regions such as multi—copy gene clusters undergo fre—
quent structural rearrangements (McHale et al., 2012) that might
become associated with different polymorphisms. Under the most
stringent filtering criteria, we found that the most significant interval
for four phenotypes (avrPhpB, aerptZ, LY and Leaf roll 10) over—
lapped or was adjacent to a multi—copy gene cluster. Therefore,
intervals of genetic heterogeneity may reﬂect structural variation
that is missed by single SNP GWAS.

Third, genetic heterogeneity may arise within a gene that under—
lies a phenotype. Our analysis uncovered a potential role for a RIN4
paralog in determining resistance to the bacterial pathogenesis fac—
tors avrB and aerpm1, but not for aerptZ or averhB. The host
immune receptor Rpm1 recognizes avrB and aerpm1 (Belkhadir
et al., 2004; Mackey et al., 2002), aerptZ is detected by another re—
ceptor (RpsZ) (Axtell and Staskawicz, 2003) and averhB is per—
ceived by a third receptor, RpsS (Shao et al., 2003). All of these
interactions are indirect and the virulence factors are not themselves
directly recognized by the receptors, but detected through their

modifications of targeted host proteins according to the Guard
Hypothesis (Jones and Dangl, 2006). For avrB, aerpm1 and
aerptZ, the target host protein (guardee) is RIN4, while averhB
targets the unrelated host protein PBS (Shao et al., 2003). The fact
that we detected a RIN4 ortholog in a novel interval for responses
to two of the three pathogenesis factors targeting RIN4 suggests the
intriguing possibility of natural variation in a guardee contributing
to pathogen resistance, similar to what has been observed for the to—
mato guardee RCR3 (Horger et al., 2012).

In short, we see exciting challenges for future work, but also
high potential for the method present here to help in the discovery
of genetic heterogeneity at a genome—wide level.

reads can map to non—target transcripts due to sequencing errors
or mapping problems. Effective use of the data requires separat—
ing these noise sites or false positives, from functional sites.
Most studies, explicitly or implicitly, assume read counts at in—
dividual sites, follow a particular distribution and use this distri—
bution to determine the probability of seeing a given number of
reads at a site by chance. However, there has been no large—scale
analysis of CLIP— and RIP—seq data to determine the most ap—
propriate choice of distribution to model these counts.

The second challenge is somewhat more esoteric. The propor—
tion of total reads falling in a given transcript does not give the
probability of that transcript being a target, but rather informs
the probability that a bound RNA is of that transcript. No know—
ledge of the number of unbound copies is available and hence the
RBPs preference for that transcript is not directly discernible.
This is true at higher resolutions also. Reads accumulate in tran—
scripts in proportion not only to the RBPs preference for that
transcript but also the transcript abundance. This is in contrast
to ChIP, where there is (in general) no variation in multiplicity
between different parts of the genome.

The final challenge we consider is that of incorporating exter—
nal information into the peak—calling process. There are a
number of types of external information, but here we consider
what is essentially control data. We give details of other external
information in Supplementary Material.

Previous studies involving CLIP—seq data have applied a range
of different approaches to site identiflcation. Because of the high
ﬁdelity of the CLIP assay, it is possible to side step the problem
and retain all sites (Licatalosi et al., 2008). This does not allow for
the ﬁltering of noise interactions. Another simple approach is to
take the top n sites under some scoring, such as normalized read
count. This requires selecting a threshold, usually arbitrarily and
clearly prevents comparing the number of sites between RBPs
or conditions (Hafner et al., 2010; Kishore et al., 2011). More

sophisticated methods employ a simulation of the CLIP—seq
experiment assuming no site—speciflc preference and use this
to arrive at a false discovery rate for any given peak height
(Chi et al., 2009; Konig et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2011;
Yeo et al., 2009). Although this allows for consideration of tran—
script abundance, there is no mechanism to explicitly adjust for
other sequencing biases and the approach is not applicable to
situations, where a second condition or control is available
(e.g. RIP—seq).

Finally, some site identiflcation methods intrinsically consider
information speciﬁc to a particular immunoprecipitation assay
(Corcoran et al., 2011; Hafner et al., 2010; Lebedeva et al., 2011;
Zhang and Darnell, 2011). Although these have been highly suc—
cessful, they cannot be applied in the more general setting.

Several databases of CLIP—seq data also exist, for example
CLIPZ, StarBase and doRiNA (Anders et al., 2012; Khorshid
et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011). The latter two focuses on
microRNA (miRNAyRBP interactions. CLIPZ and StarBase
group reads into clusters but do not perform any further site
identiflcation. In contrast, doRiNA uses a site identiﬁcation
strategy for PAR—CLIP that relies upon T to C conversions at
the cross—link site, but is unable to automatically score or rank
sites from RIP—seq or other CLIP—seq variants.

We present a method for site identiﬁcation that is applicable
across the three commonly used CLIP—seq variants and in add—
ition can be applied to RIP—seq data (for which, to our know—
ledge, no peak—calling tools currently exist). Our method
addresses each of the three challenges outlined earlier: effectively
modeling the underlying distribution, utilizing transcript abun—
dance information and flexibly allowing the incorporation of
external data. Further, we demonstrate how such a tool can be
applied to answer more advanced biological questions regarding
RBP binding sites that vary in usage between different cell types,
conditions or stages of development.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data

We compiled all CLIP-seq (HITS, iCLIP and PAR-CLIP) datasets that
were publicly available at the time of writing (see Table 1). In addition,
we analyzed a previously unpublished HITS-CLIP dataset for Ago2/
miR-l24 and a RIP-seq dataset for hTra2, which we brieﬂy describe.

For the identiﬁcation of miR-l24—guided Ago2 binding sites by CLIP,
5 cm X 15 cm plates of 293S cells at 70% conﬂuency per condition/repli-
cate were used. Cells were transfected for 24 h with 100 nM mir-l24 siRNA
(5’-UAAGGCACGCGGUGAAUGCCA-3’ and 5’-GCAUUCACCGC
GUGCCUUACA-3’ duplex) or control gl3.l siRNA (5’-CUUAC
GCUGAGUACUUCGAUU-3’ and 5’-UCGAAGUACUCAGCGUA
AGUU-3’ duplex) using Mirus Trans-IT TKO. The CLIP procedure
was carried out by a modiﬁed protocol of Chi et a]. (2009) as described
in Supplementary Material.

The RIP protocol used for hTra2 is as follows: 400 pl of Protein A
sepharose (50% slurry) was washed ﬁve times with NT2 buffer (50 mM
TrisiHCl pH 7.4, 1M TrisiHCl, 150 mM NaCl, lmM MgClz, 0.05%
NP40) and resuspended in 1 ml of NT2 plus 5% BSA and 10 ng of rabbit
anti-hTRA2B (Abcam) or normal rabbit IgG. Beads plus antibodies were
incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation and washed ﬁve times with cold
NT2 buffer. Lysates were prepared from semi-conﬂuent HeLa cells in
polysomal lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5mM
MgClz, 0.5% NP40, 2mM dithiothreitol) containing proteinase and
RNA inhibitors. After centrifugation for 10min, supernatant was
adjusted to 2mg/ml and 61111 of lysate were combined with the bead/
antibody and rotated at room temperature for 375 h. Beads were
washed ﬁve times with cold NT2. After last wash samples were digested
with RNase III; 4 pl of RNaseIII (Ambion) were combined with 600 pl of
IX buffer, added to samples and incubated for 30 min at 37°C with agi-
tation. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times
with NT2 buffer. Proteins were extracted with 25 pl (20 mg/ml) proteinase
K in 600 pl of IX buffer at 50°C for 30 min. Samples were vortexed for
1min and beads pelleted by centrifugation. The supernantant was ex-
tracted with 700 pl of acid phenolichloroform and precipitated with
sodium acetate and isopropanol. RNA was recovered by centrifugation,
washed and resuspended in 13 pl of RNase free water. Quantity and
quality were checked with Nanodrop and Bioanalyzer. Fifty nanograms
of RNA were ampliﬁed using Nugen Ovation RNA-seq System I and
libraries prepared with the Nugen Encore NGS Library System I per
manufacturer’s protocol.

To adjust for transcript abundance, we also make use of RNA-seq
data for HeLa cells (Uren et al., 2011) and HEK293 cells. All previously
unpublished sequence data have been deposited into the sequence
read archive (SRA), accession numbers: SRA056343, SRA056308,
SRA056344.

2.2 Pre-processing

For each dataset, we trimmed adapters and mapped to an appropriate
reference genome (full genomeihgl9 or mm9) and junction database
using rmap (Smith et al., 2009). Transcripts were defined per the
University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser known-
genes track. We allowed up to three mismatches when mapping and re-
tained only reads that unambiguously mapped to a single location.
Junction reads were split and assigned to both side of the junction.
Full details of the mapping results are given in Supplementary
Material. Our method does not depend on any particular mapping or
pre-processing strategy. Research is ongoing with respect to the most
effective methods for mapping RNA reads and will be further spurred
on as immunoprecipitation-based assays are paired with emerging
sequencing platforms promising longer read lengths. Coupled with an
effective choice of mapping and pre-processing techniques, our site iden-
tiﬁcation method will remain relevant.

2.3 Peak finding

The input for site identiﬁcation is a set of reads mapped to the reference
genome. All reads are binned based on the nucleotide at which they
begin. A bin represents a genomic interval and can be single nucleotide
in width. Appropriate choice of bin size is dependent on depth of cover-
age and technology used (see Section 3.3). Let y,- be the count of the
number of reads which start in the ith bin. Each bin optionally has an
associated vector of covariates, which we denote  A covariate is a
measure of some property that is expected to vary in parallel with the
immunoprecipitation read counts, but need not be count data. An ex-
ample is mappability of the bin, a measure of how many locations within
the bin start sequences of length equal to the read length, which are not
duplicated elsewhere in the genome and hence can be non-ambiguously
mapped to. Bins with low mappability are expected to correlate
with lower read count. We model the read counts within bins using
a zero-truncated negative binomial distribution (see Section 3.2 for justi-
ﬁcation). Read counts from high-throughput immunoprecipitation
experiments are Poisson over-dispersed. The negative binomial is an ap-
propriate choice of distribution for dealing with Poisson over-dispersion,
but does not correctly handle the adjusted weight for zero observations.
One option is to use the zero-inﬂated negative binomial, as was adopted
by the zero-inﬂated negative binomial algorithm (ZINBA) for peak call-
ing in ChIP-seq data (Rashid et al., 2011). However, the zero-inﬂated
negative binomial assumes a mixture, where a certain number of zeros are
drawn from the negative binomial component (and the remainder from
the zero-inﬂated component); this does not genuinely reﬂect the true
underlying distribution, which does not produce zeros. Moreover, the
additional complexity makes model ﬁtting more difﬁcult and time con-
suming. Instead, we retain only those bins with one or more reads map-
ping. We discuss this further in Supplementary Material. The zero-
truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) has the following log-likelihood
function:

Midday) = ENBULWJ)
— 2111(1 — (1 +0402), (1)
[:0

where n is the (un-truncated) mean, at is the dispersion parameter and
£NB(n|a, y) is the log-likelihood of the non-adjusted negative binomial,
that is

of] ln(l +041) + ln1“(y,» +014) ( )

—ln1"(y,»+ 1)—1nr(or1).

We fit the model by ﬁnding the maximum likelihood estimates for n
and at. We assume that the majority of sites with reads are low-occupancy
or noise sites (see Section 3.2 for details and justiﬁcation) and so the ﬁt
model represents a background. At an abstract level, our method is
modeling the read-count distribution of the dataset, which is an accept-
able proxy for the background noise distribution. We then look for 10-
cations with read counts that are unexpectedly large based on this
theoretical distribution. To do this, after model ﬁtting, each bin is as-
signed a P-value by subtracting from 1 the sum of densities for all values
less than the read count associated with that bin. Signiﬁcant bins can then
be selected by a P-value threshold; the smaller the P-value, the more
unlikely the read count in the bin is given the ﬁt distribution.

When additional external data (covariates) are available, we use a
zero-truncated negative binomial regression (ZTNBR) model (Cameron
and Trivedi, 2008; Hilbe, 2011). Brieﬂy, this requires replacing the scalar
parameter n with a vector ﬂ, where each n,» = expo???) and B is the
vector of regression coefﬁcients. The model is ﬁt using a Newtoni
Raphson algorithm for the estimation of the regression parameters and

Each bin is assigned a P-value in the same way as previously described. A
short illustration of applying the regression model to calculate P-values is
given in Table 2. Notice how large read counts do not necessarily lead to
signiﬁcant P-values. A full description of the model, its derivation and
ﬁtting is provided in Supplementary Material.

2.4 Implementation and post-processing
Our method has been implemented in a software tool called Piranha.
When no covariates are provided, it will ﬁt a ZTNB model. If covariates
are provided, it will ﬁt a ZTNBR model. Input may be either raw reads in
browser extensible data (BED) or binary sequence alignment/map
(BAM) format, or pre-binned read counts in BED format. Covariates
are provided in BED format. Output is in an extended BED format,
where an additional column gives the P-value. The implementation and
instructions for its use are given at http://smithlab.usc.edu

For the analysis in this article, we adjust output P-values to correct
for multiple hypothesis testing using the method of Benjamini and
Hochberg (1995).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Alternative methods

Two recent approaches have been proposed speciﬁcally for
addressing the problem of site identification in CLIP—seq data
(Corcoran et al., 2011; Zhang and Darnell, 2011). Zhang’s
method works on HITS—CLIP data and employs cross—linking—
induced mutation sites (CIMS, primarily deletions) to reﬁne site
location, while PARalyzer is designed for PAR—CLIP data and
relies on T to C conversions at the cross—link site. In contrast, the
method we propose works on all CLIP—seq variants (iCLIP,
PAR—CLIP, HITS—CLIP), as well as RIP—seq, while still being
able to consider the positional deletion and mutation informa—
tion used in these two methods as covariates. Further, our
method allows the consideration of additional covariates (such
as transcript abundance, which we demonstrate impacts read
counts considerably). Moreover, Zhang et a]. (2010) found that

deletion events occur only in ~8720% of mRNA tags, meaning a
substantial proportion of reads would not be informative, while
our method can take advantage of all the mapped reads in each
study. PARalyzer is publicly available and we compare its per—
formance to our method (details of usage are in Supplementary
Material); The CIMS—based method has no public implementa—
tion at the time of writing.

3.2 Read counts follow a zero-truncated negative binomial
distribution

For each dataset, we estimated the parameters of a zero—
truncated Poisson, negative binomial and zero—truncated nega—
tive binomial distribution for the counts when binned at
single—nucleotide resolution. Figure 1A and B shows visually
the improved fit provided by the ZTNB when compared to the
NB; both panels show the average density of the real data in red
and all of the fit densities for the NB and ZTNB in blue and
green, respectively. To validate the improvement seen visually in
Figure 1A and B we conducted a set of Pearson’s X2 tests. For
90.8% (109 of 120) of the datasets, the Pearson’s X2 test showed
that the zero—truncated negative binomial provides a superior
fit to a Poisson, zero—truncated Poisson or regular negative
binomial distributions (see Fig. 1C for an example and
Supplementary Table S2 for the complete set of results from
the X2 tests). The majority of sites with reads mapping are
low—occupancy or noise sites (Fig. 1D); in most of the datasets
analyzed, >80% of locations with reads mapping saw <5 reads.
Theoretically, read counts at sites are a mixture, with some
drawn from a foreground distribution and some from a back—
ground noise distribution. In practice, though the mixing param—
eter is so heavily weighted toward the background that
parameter estimates for the whole data closely approximate the
background component. This is one reason that we eschew
fitting a mixture and instead prefer the simpler single
distribution.

Site identification in high-throughput RNA-protein interaction data

 

positionally enriched around the cross—link sites, supporting their
functional importance. Finally, we also show in Figure 3C the
number of sites that have a match to any 7—mer from the
miR—124 complement around the identiﬁed sites; more than
half the sites have a match within 45 nt of the peak centre.

We compared this approach to simply calling sites separately
in each condition using the ZTNB (without covariates) and
then taking those sites which are signiﬁcant in the miR— 124 trans—
fection, but not in the control. Using this approach, the top
six enriched motifs match miRNAs other than miR—124; none
of them is a match for miR—124. Further details are in
Supplementary Material.

Although here we have applied this to the problem of miRNA
target site identiﬁcation, the same approach could be used
to identify differentially bound sites in any conceivable pair of
tissues or conditions, an exciting research direction that promises
to further expand our understanding of how RBPs participate in
cell—fate determination and pathogenesis or for exploring RBP
evolution by comparing across species.

4 CONCLUSON

HITS coupled with immunoprecipitation assays have provided
an unprecedented level of accuracy in identifying the targets and
binding sites for RBPs. Despite this, the data collected from such
experiments require some considerable care to extract the most
meaningful information from it. Within this article, we have
highlighted three challenges that are presented when attempting
to identify proteiniRNA interactions sites in high—throughput
immunoprecipitation sequencing data: selecting the correct dis—
tribution for modeling reads, dealing with the transcript abun—
dance bias and incorporating additional external information
into the peak—calling process.

We introduced Piranha, a peak—calling tool based on the
zero—truncated negative binomial regression model that is able
to incorporate external information to guide the site identiﬁca—
tion process. We demonstrated that transcript abundance inﬂu—
ences the read counts at sites in IP datasets, that Piranha can
successfully incorporate RNA—seq control data to ameliorate this
bias and that by considering this additional information, more
accurate peak calls are arrived at. We also showed that our
method can be applied across all of the currently existing
CLIP—seq technologies and also handles the more complex case
of RIP—seq data. Finally, we also demonstrated Piranha’s appli—
cation to more complex biological questions involving multiple
cell types, conditions, stages of development or species.

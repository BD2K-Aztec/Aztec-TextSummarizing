ABSTRACT

Summary: In the post-genomic era, the annotation of protein
function facilitates the understanding of various biological processes.
To extend the range of function annotation methods to the twilight
zone of sequence identity, we have developed approaches that
exploit both protein tertiary structure and/or protein sequence
evolutionary relationships. To serve the scientific community, we
have integrated the structure prediction tools, TASSER, TASSER-Lite
and METATASSER, and the functional inference tools, FINDSITE, a
structure-based algorithm for binding site prediction, Gene Ontology
molecular function inference and ligand screening, EFICAZ2, a
sequence-based approach to enzyme function inference and DBD-
hunter, an algorithm for predicting DNA-binding proteins and
associated DNA-binding residues, into a unified web resource,
Protein Structure and Function prediction Resource (PSiFR).
Availability and implementation: PSiFR is freely available for use
on the web at http://psifr.cssb.biology.gatech.edu/

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past decade, the success of genome sequencing has
produced a large number of gene products with unknown
structure and function (Benson et (11., 2009). The description of
protein function ranges from its biochemical role to its role in
determining phenotypical response (Skolnick and Fetrow, 2000).
Thus, the complete functional annotation of a protein is a
time consuming process that involves data curation from both
computational and experimental studies (Consortium, 2009). Most
computational function annotation tools use protein sequences to
detect evolutionary relationships between proteins of unknown and
known function that provide functional clues for ~40—60% of
the gene products in a given proteome (Gerstein, 1998; Muller
et (11., 1999). However, these methods begin to fail as the sequence
becomes more distant from proteins of known function (Gerstein,
1998; Tian and Skolnick, 2003). Since protein tertiary structure is
more conserved than sequence, structure can play an important role
in functional annotation (Baker and Sali, 2001 ; Skolnick and Fetrow,
2000). However, experimental determination of protein structure

is time consuming, expensive and not always feasible (Slabinski
et (11., 2007). This motivated the development of proteome-scale
automated methods for protein tertiary structure and molecular
function prediction.

In recent years, we developed the protein structure prediction
algorithm TASSER that employs a hierarchical approach consisting
of template identiﬁcation by threading, followed by tertiary structure
assembly from continuous template fragments (Zhang and Skolnick,
2004). TASSER can often reﬁne the threading templates generating
ﬁnal models closer to their native tertiary structure than the input
templates (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004). Recently, TASSER was
improved by incorporating information from consensus threading
templates (METATASSER) (Zhou et (11., 2007). The assessment
of TASSER’s performance in CASP 6-8 shows that it is among
the best structure prediction algorithms (Zhang et (11., 2005; Zhou
et (11., 2007). Furthermore, to provide rapid results, while retaining
TASSER’s ability to improve structure quality, we developed
TASSER-Lite, a version applicable when the sequence identity
between target and template is 325% (Pandit et (11., 2006).

For ﬁinction annotation, we have implemented FINDSITE
(Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008) for ligand-binding site prediction,
DBD-Hunter (Gao and Skolnick, 2008) for DNA-binding prediction
and EFTCAz2 (Enzyme Function Inference by a Combined
Approach) (Arakaki et (11., 2009) for enzyme ﬁinction inference.
FINDSITE predicts ligand-binding pockets based on the binding
site similarity among superimposed groups of template structures
identiﬁed from threading. Here, threading acts as a ﬁlter to establish
that the set of identiﬁed template structures are evolutionary related.
FINDSITE also speciﬁes the chemical properties of ligands that
are likely to occupy the binding site and provides a collection
of ligand templates for use in ﬁngerprint-based virtual ligand
screening. Furthermore, FINDSITE assigns Gene Ontology (GO)
terms (Ashburner et (11., 2000) with a probability that corresponds
to the fraction of threading templates annotated with that molecular
function (Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008). DBD-Hunter is a recently
developed structure-based method for identifying DNA-binding
proteins and associated binding sites (Gao and Skolnick, 2008).
The method ﬁrst selects potential DNA-binding proteins through
structural comparison to known DNA-binding proteins, and further
assesses DNA-binding propensity with a DNA—protein interfacial
potential. Finally, EFTCAz2 is an enzyme ﬁinction inference
approach that employs machine learning techniques to combine
predictions from six different methods developed and optimized to
achieve high prediction accuracy (Arakaki et (11., 2009).

2 PSiFR SERVER OVERVIEW

The Protein Structure and Function prediction Resource (PSiFR)
server provides integrated tools for protein tertiary structure
prediction and structure and sequence-based function annotation.

Users can submit the protein sequence or structure with options for
structure/function prediction (Fig. 1a) and a user-friendly output for
Visualizing the results is provided (Fig. 1b).

The results from tertiary structure prediction
(TASSER/METATASSER) include the display of the threading
alignments and protein models, Visualized using Jmol (Jmol: an
open-source Java Viewer for chemical structures in 3D) (Fig. 1b).
FINDSITE uses the top predicted model or the user’s submitted
structure for function prediction. For each model, the results for the
top ﬁve binding pockets are displayed. For each pocket, predicted
ligand-binding residues and predicted GO terms are shown (Fig. 1b).
In addition, results of ligand-based Virtual screening against the
KEGG compound library are also displayed. DBD—Hunter reports
whether or not the target protein is likely to bind DNA and, for
putative DNA-binding proteins, shows the predicted DNA-binding
residues. Similarly, results from EFICAz2 show whether the target
protein is likely to be an enzyme, in which case the predicted three
ﬁeld or four ﬁeld enzyme commission (EC) number is also reported.
The important feature of PSiFR is that its component methods
provide conﬁdence measures of the prediction quality. This helps
a user to assess the reliability of the predictions. The PSiFR web
service is accessible Via http://psifr.cssb.biology.gatech.edu/.

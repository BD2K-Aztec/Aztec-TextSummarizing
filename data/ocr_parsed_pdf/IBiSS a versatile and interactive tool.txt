l\bstract

Motivation: In the past few years, an increasing number of crystal and cryo electron microscopy
(cryo—EM) structures of large macromolecular complexes, such as the ribosome or the RNA
polymerase, have become available from various species. These multi—subunit complexes can be
difficult to analyze at the level of amino acid sequence in combination with the 3D structural organ—
ization of the complex. Therefore, novel tools for simultaneous analysis of structure and sequence
information of complex assemblies are required to better understand the basis of molecular mech—
anisms and their functional implications.

Results: Here, we present a web—based tool, Integrative Biology of Sequences and Structures
(lBiSS), which is designed for interactively displaying 3D structures and selected sequences of
subunits from large macromolecular complexes thus allowing simultaneous structure—sequence
analysis such as conserved residues involved in catalysis or protein—protein interfaces. This tool
comprises a Graphic User Interface and uses a rapid—access internal database, containing the rele—
vant pre—aligned multiple sequences across all species available and 3D structural information.
These annotations are automatically retrieved and updated from UniProt and crystallographic
and cryo—EM data available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank
(EMDB).

Availability and implementation: The database contains all currently available structures of ribo—
somes, RNA polymerases, nucleosomes, proteasome, photosystem I and II complexes. IBiSS is
available at http://ibiss.igbmc.fr

From an Integrated Structural Biology perspective, new tools are
needed that allow researchers to conduct broader studies in which
various techniques, such as bioinformatics, biochemistry, crystallog—
raphy and cryo electron microscopy (cryo—EM), may be combined
(Klostermeier and Hammann, 2013 Ménétret et al. chapter). Within
such an interdisciplinary approach, the integration of diverse
sequence—structure—function aspects of a macromolecular complex
becomes critical, and it is challenging with regards to the growing
amount of biological information. Moreover, because of frequently
changing nomenclatures or different naming conventions of related
proteins in different organisms, it can become quite tedious to perform
a comprehensive study. For well—documented families, such as riboso—
mal proteins, Uniprot allows gathering through protein families to fa—
cilitate the search. In many cases, the nomenclatures of these proteins
lack unifying names; an example of addressing this problem is the re—
cent renaming of ribosomal proteins into a species—unifying nomencla—
ture (Ban et al., 2014; Ben—Shem et al., 2011; Yusupov et al., 2001).
Moreover, errors can occur and propagate due to automatic
annotations which in turn are used for other annotations. The
above—mentioned constraints make the use of these data complicated
and require additional searching and tedious sorting and validation by
the user.

While convenient stand—alone tools exist for sequence alignments
(e.g. ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994), PipeAlign (Plewniak et al.,
2003)), taxonomic analysis (e.g. Phylogeny.fr (Dereeper et al.,
2008), iTOL (Letunic and Bork, 2007)), and for structure analysis
(e.g. Pymol (Delano, 2002) and Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004)),
there is no easy way to combine all this information (Procter et al.,
2010) which would provide a better understanding of the basis of
molecular mechanisms and their functional implications. Software
such as Friend (Abyzov et al., 2005), STRAP (Gille and Robinson,
2006), Chimera’s MultAlign viewer (Meng et al., 2006), ConSurf
(Ashkenazy et al., 2010) and PyMod (Bramucci et al., 2012) are not
connected to a database and require a lot of manual intervention by
the user. In general, existing software are better adapted for manual
analysis of individual proteins with relatively small data sets, while
not being designed for large—scale sequence analysis required for
multi—subunit complexes. Thus, interactivity between sequence
alignments and 3D structures directly connected to a database often
remains unsatisfactory.

Larger databases, such as the NCBI (Ostell and Kans, 1998) and
EBI (Emmert et al., 1994), are focusing their efforts on data storage
and allow data mining to some extent. Other website tools such as
PipeAlign (Plewniak et al., 2003) focus on the processing of se—
quences, providing efficient and easy to use sequence alignment
tools and classification into protein sub—families. Specialized data—
bases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Bernstein et al., 1977;
Meyer, 1997; Peitsch et al., 1995), allow a preview of the structural
data online via a Jmol applet version, but simultaneous sequence
analysis is not possible. The NCBI server allows finding structures
with a sequence similar to that of the query by using CBLAST
(Wang et al., 2007), and structures can be viewed with the sequence
alignment using the software Cn3D (Hogue, 1997) (‘see in 3D’).
However, there are some limitations in that it requires downloading
the software and retrieve all the structure and sequence data to per—
form the analysis locally, and the sequence alignment is limited to
two sequences only, while protein subunits may contain hundreds;
also, there is no particular amino acid color code there which could
facilitate the identification of residues. Taken together, there is a
critical need for tools, which could directly combine multiple se—
quence alignments and structures specifically for large and complex
molecular assemblies which are particularly challenging to analyze.

Here, we propose an interactive tool that directly combines
structure and sequence analysis using an integrated database of the
relevant protein sequence alignments and available 3D structures.
Using a web database, it provides access to data relevant for all the
subunits of a given macromolecular complex. Such a multi—subunit
complex is handled as a set of proteins, each of which contains the
relevant data (sequences and atomic coordinates) and which are
validated beforehand (e.g. protein sequence fragments are removed).
The database contains the pre—calculated sequence alignments which
are viewable in a Jalview applet window, and structures can be
visualized in a Jmol applet window. It thus becomes easy to correl—
ate structure and sequence alignments directly online for all avail—
able structures. Other tools, such as phylogenetic trees, tools for
coevolutionary analysis, comparison between species with different
composition of complexes are also available.

Methods

The development tools used for the database are web technologies,
which are the most appropriate with respect to speed and ease of use.
The database is based on the NoSQL language (Lith and Mattsson,
2010) and uses MongoDB (Chodorow and Dirolf, 2010), which
allows heterogeneous data to be handled, irrespective of their nature
and quantity and which ensures a fast access for intensive search re—
quests. The online services are written in Java and JavaScript.

Proteins included in the database were retrieved from Uniprot
(preiler et al., 2004), provided they have the status ‘reviewed’ as
annotated in Swiss—Prot (Bairoch and Boeckmann, 1991; Bairoch
and preiler, 1996). For each protein family, selection criteria such
as protein name, gene name, sequence length were manually applied
to check for errors such as annotation errors and partial sequences,
before adding a given protein into a list for automatic updating. All
PDB files associated with the sequences have been integrated in the
database, together with extensive links to other databases, e.g.
PubMed (Liu and Altman, 1998) and EMBL (Hamm and Cameron,
1986), and references have been linked to each protein. For each
protein, IDs to all other databases referenced by UniProt are used to
create links to each of the corresponding databases. For each protein
subunit of a macromolecular complex, a global, multiple sequence
alignment has been pre—calculated with the software ClustalW2 and
Mafft (Katoh et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 1994), integrated into
the database, and the user can choose between the two sequence
alignments. To enable the simultaneous visualization of sequence
alignments and 3D structures, an interactive link between sequence
and structure was created using the software packages Jalview
(Clamp et al., 2004; Waterhouse et al., 2009) and Jmol (Herraez,
2006; Cammer, 2007) (Java applet version). This allows processing
data directly online in a fully interactive manner with an interface
that comprises two windows for 3D structure and sequence, respect—
ively. Interfacing between sequence alignments and 3D structure
visualization is facilitated by the Jalview version that is part of Jmol.
Amino acids are thus connected between the 2D sequence alignment
and 3D structure, and a simple mouse movement over the sequence
or structure easily displays the link by changing the appearance of
the residue of interest. All Jalview and Jmol applet options remain
available, such as editing of sequence alignments. The color code of
the sequence alignment is transferred onto the structure using the
amino acid color code implemented in PipeAlign according to dis—
tinct physicochemical properties (Plewniak et al., 2003). An add—
itional user interface implemented in JavaScript allows quick
visualization of structures without displaying the sequences.

Results

From the perspective of integrated structural biology, it is essential
to be able to visualize and handle protein sequences and 3D struc—
tures in a correlated manner. The present tool, called Integrative
Biology of Sequences and Structures (IBiSS), provides a user—friendly
interface to interactively link and analyze sequences and 3D struc—
tures. Several types of information are needed to facilitate the con—
nection between the analysis of 3D structures and sequence
alignments from the level of the full complex down to individual
protein subunits and residues. One of the key characteristics of IBiSS
is to allow the identification of a conserved amino acid in a given se—
quence and have it simultaneously highlighted and localized in the
3D structure. This allows the user to analyze its role in molecular
recognition in protein—protein or protein—nucleic acid interfaces and
interactions (e.g. for translation and transcription complexes (Anger
et al., 2013; Ban et al., 2000; Eiler et al., 2013; Harms et al., 2001;
Klaholz et al., 2004; Klaholz, 2011; Maletta et al., 2014; Marzi
et al., 2007; Orlov et al., 2012; Simonetti et al., 2008; Simonetti
et al., 2013a, b; Wimberly et al., 2000), in catalysis or in other
functions.

To enlarge the potential applications of IBiSS, several important,
widely studied macromolecular complexes involved in transcription
or translation or other key cellular processes have been incorporated
in the IBiSS database. These include the ribosome, the nucleosome,
the RNA polymerase, the proteasome and photosystem complexes I
and II (Fig. 1A) (Beck et al., 2012; da Fonseca et al., 2012; Golbeck,
1987; Guskov et al., 2009; Low et al., 2014; Loll et al., 2005;
Saenger et al., 2002). For each complex, a set of protein subunits is
defined. Additional, more specific functionalities allow the

comparison of protein composition in different species and taxo—

The development tools used for the database are web—based tech—
nologies, which have proven to be the most appropriate in terms of
speed and ease of use. Indeed, the database NoSQL allows handling
very heterogeneous data, as is often the case in biology. Web—based
technologies allow the tool to be used on any operating system (OS),
without special installation requirements or compatibility problems,
facilitating software access and distribution. The choice of the
MongoDB database that contains all the data provides high—speed
interactivity. External databases, such as Uniprot and PDB are used
only in the context of updating, but are not called directly through
the interactive user interfaces. Because precalculated sequence align—
ments and PDB coordinates are stored in MongoDB, a quick and
interactive access to the web site is achieved, which greatly enhances
the data access speed through the web site. The update is done auto—
matically on a monthly basis. To take into account modifications of
sequence annotations and corrections, not only novel sequences are
added but the entire sequences are updated with the associated
structures. The aligned sequences are obtained from a global align—
ment to minimize alignment errors by using a large number of se—
quences. When required, it is possible to extract and display just two
sequences out of many, while still benefiting from the better global
alignment as compared to a simple pair—wise alignment (Fig. 1B). It
is also possible to select a portion of the alignment for a quick taxo—
nomic analysis using the checkbox, the results in the Sequence tab or
directly on the co—evolution page.

In the following, we describe practical aspects of the IBiSS tool
that are available to the user. On the main web page, the user selects
the complex of interest, e.g. ribosome, nucleosome, etc. Next, a spe—
cific protein can be chosen. IBiSS then produces a page that contains
all sequences related to this protein, and sequence alignment and 3D
structure tools available for each sequence. The residue color code of
the alignment is reported on the 3D structure and facilitates residue
identification. A Jmol window allows visualizing the 3D structure and
a Jalview window shows the sequence alignment. The two windows
are connected interactively (Jmol is integrated in Jalview and serves
for the 3D visualization). If the mouse is positioned over an amino
acid of the 3D structure, the same amino acid in the corresponding se—
quence in the sequence alignment is automatically recentered and
changes color in the Jalview window. Inversely, if the mouse is over
an amino acid in the 2D sequence alignment window, the correspond—
ing amino acid becomes highlighted in the structure (Fig. 2A). On the
left panel, a table is included with the description of each sequence
and an annotation of the protein describing name, species, UniProt
identifier, tools for 3D visualization and correlation between se—
quences and structures that are displayed for each structure. Full in—
formation for each protein is also visible in a checkbox and by
referring to a ‘References tab’ that allows a complete description of
the protein with active links to other databases, in a manner as imple—
mented in UniProt (preiler et al., 2004). Displaying the results for
the selected sequence is achieved without leaving the web page to
avoid toggling between pages. A panel on the right of the interface
provides access to sequence alignments, 3D structures, taxonomy and
bibliographic references. Multiple sequence alignments can be
retrieved from the IBiSS webpage. A portion of the alignment can be
isolated to compare two or more sequences. The ‘3D’ tab allows han—
dling all the information relevant to the available 3D structures. A
Jmol window is embedded in the web page with an interface to access
the main features. The ‘3D’ tab provides a quick and interactive view,
for any of the available structures for this protein (structure of the pro—
tein alone, and structure of the protein complex). Displaying the PDB

text file provides a view of the comments about the structures, such as
the COMPND record that describes the macromolecular contents of
an entry. The functionalities of Jmol are available by right clicking, in
the same way as on the Jmol application of the PDB website, and
some options are facilitated through the JavaScript interface (e.g. dis—
play options of macromolecules; Fig. 1C). All 3D functionalities,
including those for structure—sequence correlation, will automatically
load the Java applets. The ‘taxonomy’ tab allows displaying an inter—
active taxonomic tree summary for each species for which at least one
sequence is present.

To analyze correlated amino acid changes, a coevolution analysis
tool has been integrated in IBiSS which includes the entire protein
database. It allows choosing a taxon for the protein of interest in a
taxonomic tree, and visualizes the corresponding sequence align—
ments. Coevolutionary sequence variability between taxa can also
be observed, e.g. if a taxon reveals a mutation in a binding site, the
interacting protein partner of the same taxon may carry a comple—
mentary or compensatory mutation.

To illustrate the main features of the IBiSS tool, we present a typ—
ical example of a ribosomal protein, S7, which is part of the bacter—
ial ribosome (~54 proteins, 3 rRNAs; Anger et al., 2013; Ban et al.,
2000; Harms et al., 2001; Wimberly et al., 2000). S7 is located on
the platform region of the 30S ribosomal subunit, close to the inter—
face with the 50S subunit and the exit—site tRNA. It is involved in
the binding of mRNA to the small ribosomal subunit. Using IBiSS,
the number of sequences available for the S7p protein can be visual—
ized at a glance. The sequence alignment reveals high sequence

some. (A) Global view of the structure with protein S7 (small ribosomal subunit,
308) interactively linked with the sequence alignment. The mRNA and tRNAs
are indicated in red and blue, respectively. (B) In the example given, ribosomal
protein S7 is localized on the structure window with the backbone chain resi-
dues labeled according to the residue color code in the sequence window. The
solvent-exposed and conserved residue Arg 79 is highlighted in red as a good
candidate for interactions with mRNA bound in the 308 platform region. mRNA
and tRNAs are colored in red, blue and cyan respectively. For simplicity, riboso-
mal rRNAs and the 508 ribosomal subunit are not shown

conservation across species, with one variable domain between pro—
karyotes and eukaryotes.

This example illustrates the powerful potential of a convenient
interactive analysis linking 3D structure and sequence alignment. By
analyzing the amino acid conservation in the sequence alignment, a
series of amino acids can be identified that are positively charged and
highly conserved in all species of ribosomal protein S7. These residues
are mainly located in the C—terminal region of protein S7. Because
they do not interact with other proteins or with other ribosomal com—
ponents, but instead are solvent—exposed, it can be concluded that
they are important for the binding of mRNA considering that many
of the conserved residues carry positively charged side—chains which
could interact with the negatively charged phosphate moieties of the
mRNA. Thus, it is very easy to localize surface—exposed residues that

interface between proteins S7 and 811. In protein 811, a phenylalanine (B)
residue conserved in bacteria (label ‘F') is replaced by a tyrosine (label ‘Y')
conserved in fungi; within a 3 A distance, in protein 87, an alanine (A) residue
is replaced by a serine residue, suggesting an additional hydrogen bond
between protein S7 and S11 in fungi. With the IBiSS tool, this analysis is
quick and easy thanks to its integrated database

could be involved in mRNA recognition (Fig. 2B). In a previous study,
all of this comprised a tedious manual analysis, including the retrieval
of structures, sequences and residue identification (Marzi et al., 2007).

An additional taxonomy analysis is also possible, which in this
example leads to a large number of proteins because of the broad
representation of protein S7 in prokaryotes, eukaryotes or archaea.
The taxonomy can be used to study coevolutionary aspects from the
‘co—evolution’ page. From the taxonomic tree, one can select the
protein of interest for many taxa of interest and display the corres—
ponding alignments. Because several amino acids of interest have
been already identified, each taxon can be displayed to more easily
identify at what point of evolution a given mutation occurred. It is
also possible to use multiple Jalview and Jmol windows simultan—
eously (e.g. with multiple screens). The 3D structure shows that pro—
tein—protein interactions occur between protein S7 and proteins S9
and S11 (Fig. 3), for which the identification of amino acids is
straightforward in IBiSS. Moreover, co—evolution analysis in IBiSS
conveniently identifies a conserved residue pair at the interface be—
tween proteins S7 and S11 (Fig. 3). Inversely, strictly conserved
amino acids in proteins S9 and S11 which are involved in protein—
protein interactions with S7 can be identified easily within the ribo—
some complex.

Taken together, IBiSS provides a convenient, interactive and ro—
bust tool that facilitates combined structure and sequence analysis
of complicated, multi—subunit macromolecular complexes. As com—
pared to the combined usage of independent tools such as STRAP,
Friend, Chimera and PyMOL, IBiSS represents a significant added
value in that it provides an immediate, interactive and structured
way to access the data through an integrated database which inter—
actively links structures, pre—computed multi—sequence alignments,
co—evolutionary and phylogeny tools. The data are standardized and
grouped into protein families thus simplifying work when the same
protein has several different names in the databanks. All features are
integrated and can be used directly without the need of plugins.
This is very useful for the identification of conserved amino acids and
their 3D localization, eventually leading to design of new experiments
for testing the functional implications of a particular residue. Using a
web—based database, IBiSS gives immediate access to the relevant pro—
tein sequence alignments and available 3D structures for all the sub—
units of a given macromolecular complex. An additional typical
feature of IBiSS is that phylogenetic analysis and coevolutionary tools
are linked to multi—sequence alignments.

Taken together, the present tool provides an easy and unified ac—
cess to structure and sequence information of large complexes and
allows data mining in an interactive and correlated manner, thus
facilitating the identification of conserved amino acids in a sequence
and their localization in the 3D structure. In the example provided
above, residues exposed on the surface of the small ribosomal sub—
unit platform can be identified much more easily than in the previ—
ously published manual analysis (Marzi et al., 2007). In general,
IBiSS contributes to the development of integrative tools which are
increasingly needed for integrated biology approaches. The prepro—
cessed data which are accessible online allow performing bioinfor—
matics analysis without requiring much data manipulation nor
advanced knowledge in bioinformatics data processing. The data—
base within IBiSS currently contains a series of typical large com—
plexes, the ribosome (including the latest human ribosome structure;
(Khatter et al., 2015), translation initiation factors, the RNA poly—
merases, nucleosome, proteasome and photosystem I and II com—
plexes. Currently, the database comprises 62 000 sequence entries
and 2400 structure entries which are pre—processed to enhance inter—
activity. In the future, it could become interesting to extend IBiSS to

include user—defined complexes to create their own data base within
IBiSS.

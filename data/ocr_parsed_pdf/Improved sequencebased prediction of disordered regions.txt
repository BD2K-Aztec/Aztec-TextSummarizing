ABSTRACT

Motivation: Intrinsically disordered proteins play a crucial role
in numerous regulatory processes. Their abundance and ubiquity
combined with a relatively low quantity of their annotations motivate
research toward the development of computational models that
predict disordered regions from protein sequences. Although the
prediction quality of these methods continues to rise, novel and
improved predictors are urgently needed.

Results: We propose a novel method, named MFDp (Multilayered
Fusion-based Disorder predictor), that aims to improve over
the current disorder predictors. MFDp is as an ensemble of
3 Support Vector Machines specialized for the prediction of
short, long and generic disordered regions. It combines three
complementary disorder predictors, sequence, sequence profiles,
predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility, backbone
dihedral torsion angles, residue flexibility and B-factors. Our method
utilizes a custom-designed set of features that are based on raw
predictions and aggregated raw values and recognizes various types
of disorder. The MFDp is compared at the residue level on two
datasets against eight recent disorder predictors and top-performing
methods from the most recent CASP8 experiment. In spite of
using training chains with 525% similarity to the test sequences,
our method consistently and significantly outperforms the other
methods based on the MCC index. The MFDp outperforms modern
disorder predictors for the binary disorder assignment and provides
competitive real-valued predictions. The MFDp’s outputs are also
shown to outperform the other methods in the identification of
proteins with long disordered regions.

1 INTRODUCTION

The intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), also referred to
as unstructured proteins, lack stable tertiary structure under
physiological conditions in vitro. The IDPs play a crucial
role in transcriptional regulation, translation and cellular signal
transduction (Dunker et (11., 2008). Their prevalence was also
implicated in various human disorders including the neuro-
degenerative diseases such as Huntington, Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s disease (Raychaudhuri et (11., 2009). However, the
functional role of IDPs is not as well understood when compared
with the well-packed proteins. Importantly, the annotations of the
disorder lag behind the rapidly accumulating number of known

protein chains. To compare, the curated DisProt database (Sickmeier
et (11., 2007) includes little over 500 chains, the PDB database
(Berman et (11., 2000) that allows ﬁnding unstructured segments in
the solved tertiary structures (which are assumed to be equivalent to
disordered segments) includes ~58 000 proteins, while the overall
number of known protein chains is >9 million. The disorder
is frequently observed in regions with low-sequence complexity
and with low content of hydrophobic amino acids, which would
often form a core of a folded globular protein (Dyson and
Wright, 2005; Uversky et (11., 2000). These and other sequence
characteristics can be used to differentiate between disordered and
ordered regions, which in turn implies that disorder is predictable
from the sequence. The past decade observed development of a
number of computational models for the prediction of the disordered
regions. These methods allow for high-throughput annotations
of protein chains which provide a viable solution to close the
annotation gap. These predictors could be categorized into four
groups: (i) methods based on relative propensity of amino acids
to form disorder/ordered regions which include GlobPlot (Linding
et (11., 2003), IUPred (Dosztanyi et (11., 2005), FoldIndex (Prilusky
et (11., 2005) and Ucon (Schlessinger et (11., 2007a); (ii) methods
built utilizing machine-learning classiﬁers, such as DISpro (Hecker
et (11., 2008), DISOPRED (Jones and Ward, 2003) DISOPRED2
(Ward et (11., 2004), PrDOS (Ishida and Kinoshita, 2007), POODLE-
S (Shimizu et (11., 2007a), POODLE-L (Hirose et (11., 2007),
POODLE-W (Shimizu et (11., 2007b), Spritz (Vullo et (11., 2006),
DisPSSMP (Su et (11., 2006), DisPSSMP2 (Su et (11., 2007), IUP
(Yang and Yang, 2006), NORSnet (Schlessinger et (11., 2007b) and
OnD-CRFs (Wang and Sauer, 2008); (iii) methods based on a meta-
approach which combines predictions from multiple base predictors
including recent MD (Schlessinger et (11., 2009), metaPrDOS (Ishida
and Kinoshita, 2008), GS-metaDisorder (J.Bujnicki, unpublished
data) and MULTICOM (Cheng et (11., 2005); and (iv) methods
based on analysis of predicted 3D structural models, such as
DISOclust (McGufﬁn, 2008). Since 2002, the sequence-based
disorder predictors are biannually assessed and compared during
the critical assessment of structure prediction (CASP) experiments.
Although the prediction quality continues to rise, as shown in the
most recent CASP8 (Noivirt-Brik et (11., 2009), improved prediction
methods are still urgently needed (Schlessinger et (11., 2009).

We propose a novel architecture, named MFDp (Multilayered
Fusion-based Disorder predictor), that aims to improve the overall
quality of the prediction when compared with modern methods. We
analyze and quantify improvements provided by MFDp for a generic
prediction of all disordered segments and also for the prediction of
long-disordered segments. The latter is motivated by recent results
that show that long-disordered regions are useful for target selection
for structure determination of integral membrane protein (Punta

et (11., 2009), they are implicated in protein—protein recognition
(Tompa et (11., 2009) and were found helpful in prediction of protein
crystallization propensity (Slabinski et (11., 2007).

The MFDp is based on four novel ideas. First, motivated by
the observation that combining orthogonal predictors is helpful
(Oldﬁeld et (11., 2005; Schlessinger et (11., 2009), we ﬁise four
complementary disorder predictors. This is in contrast to earlier
ensemble-based solutions that combined predictors selected in an ad
hoc manner. When compared to the recently proposed orthogonal
ensemble-based MD predictor (Schlessinger et (11., 2009), we
consider different aspects to judge dissimilarity. MD combines four
predictors that tackle different ‘types’ of disorder, while we combine
three methods that differ in their approach to perform predictions.
We use a machine learning-based predictor DISOPRED2, residue
propensity-based IUPred and a recent DISOclust that is based on
tertiary structure predictions (i.e. prediction based on the sequence-
derived tertiary structure). The usage of the 3D-based predictor is
the novel aspect of our ensemble. We select DISOPRED2 since
it was demonstrated to provide high-quality predictions and to be
orthogonal to other machine learning-based methods (Schlessinger
et (11., 2009). The IUPred provides two models that specialize
in prediction of long- and short-disordered regions, respectively.
The DISOclust utilizes a premise that ordered residues should be
conserved in 3D space in multiple models, whereas residues that
vary or are consistently missing are correlated with the disorder. It
predicts per-residue error in multiple fold recognition models which
is followed by an analysis of the conservation of the per-residue
errors across all models (McGufﬁn, 2008).

Second, we use the most comprehensive selection of the input
information sources when compared with the recent methods
(Table 1). Similar to MD, DISpro and MULTICOM, we use the
sequence proﬁles (the most widely used inputs; Table I), predicted
secondary structure (SS) [disordered regions are characterized by
lack of SS (Radivojac et (11., 2004, 2007; Vucetic et (11., 2003)]
and solvent accessibility [unstructured regions have a large solvent-
accessible area (Schlessinger et (11., 2009)] . We also utilize sequence-
based predictions of backbone dihedral torsion angles, B-factor
[which are associated with disordered regions (Zhang et (11., 2009)]

and the sequence terminus indicator [similarly to PrDOS (Su et (11.,
2007)]. The usage of the backbone angles is motivated by their
usefulness in building-scoring ﬁinction for fold recognition and 3D
structure prediction (Wu and Zhang, 2008), and by the success of
the 3D-based DISOclust that ranked fourth in CASP8 (Noivirt-Brik
et (11., 2009). We tried predictions of signal peptides, but we did not
ﬁnd them useful.

Third, we aggregate the predictions, before feeding them into a
classiﬁer, using a sliding window to facilitate predictions of long-
disordered regions. The aggregation utilizes neighboring predictions
to perform averaging, to ﬁnd maximal and minimal prediction
value/probability and to analyze local SS conformations, which
helps the classiﬁer to ﬁnd longer stretches of disordered residues.

Fourth, we use two-layered architecture where the ﬁrst layer
includes three predictors, one designed for all disordered residues,
one for short (<30 residues), and one for long segments. These
predictors use different inputs encoded using numerical descriptors
derived from the abovementioned sources. The second layer
combines their outputs to generate our disorder predictions.

MFDp is capable of recognizing various types of disorder, since
it is trained using a dataset that includes residues from disordered
regions of all sizes and that combines proteins from the DisProt
database and X-ray structures from the PDB.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

The proposed method was designed and tested on a dataset with 514 protein
sequences. These sequences were harvested from the PDB and the DisProt
databases. The PDB sequences were ﬁltered using the culled PDB list (Wang
and Dunbrack. 1993) to extract a high-quality and low-sequence identity
subset. We selected sequences that have structures with R-factor <02 and
resolution <2.0 A. and that are characterized by sequence identity <5%.
The above follows the selection process used by GS-metaDisorder. one
of the leading methods in CASP8. Since most protein chains in PDB are
completely ordered. we kept randomly selected 20% of the ordered proteins.
We extracted the entire set of 1195 proteins from the current release 4.9 of
the DisProt and we merged them with the PDB chains. The combined set was

MFDp - Multilayered fusion-based disorder predictor

 

ﬁltered at 25% sequence identity as follows. For a given pair of sequences
that share >25% identity. we remove the chain that has fewer disordered
residues. Next. we removed any of the remaining 522 sequences that share
signiﬁcant similarity with chains in the CASP8 dataset that is also used
to validate our predictions; we removed each sequence that shares >25%
identity to any of the CASP8 targets. The resulting dataset. named mixed
disorder (MxD) dataset. has 514 protein sequences. with 309 from DisProt
and 205 from PDB. Our method is also compared against other solutions
using the CASP8 dataset. which contains 122 proteins; details concerning
this dataset are given in Noivirt-Brik et a1. (2009).

2.2 Deﬁnition of disorder

Prior works show that the assignment of the disordered regions performed
using different experimental methods is not always consistent (Vucetic at (11..
2003). The disorder predictors that were trained on regions identiﬁed by
one experimental method could be less accurate for prediction of disordered
regions that were characterized by other methods (Schlessinger at (11.. 2007a.
b). To date. there is no golden standard for the assignment of the disordered
regions. In the past CASP experiments the disordered regions were deﬁned as
residues that lack coordinates in structures solved by X-ray crystallography
and as residues that exhibit high variability within ensemble or are annotated
as disordered in REMARK 465 by experimentalists for the structures solved
by NMR (Bordoli at (11.. 2007; Noivirt-Brik at (11.. 2009). Consequently.
the above deﬁnition is used to annotate disordered residues in the CASP8
dataset. The MxD dataset utilizes two types of annotations to generalize the
proposed predictive model. The chains extracted from PDB are annotated
using the above deﬁnition. while the chains from DisProt use the curated
annotations extracted from this database.

2.3 Evaluation criteria and test procedures

The assessment of the predictions uses the same criteria as in the CASP
experiments (Bordoli at (11.. 2007; Noivirt-Brik at (11.. 2009). The evaluation
was performed per-residue since per-protein predictions are more prone to
overﬁtting (Schlessinger 21111.. 2009). The predictions are at two levels: (i) the
binary value that deﬁnes whether a given residue is or is not disordered;
and (ii) the real value that quantiﬁes probability of disorder. The binary
predictions were assessed using ﬁve measures:
C_ TP>i<TN—FP>i<FN
— \/(TP+ FP) >l< (TP+ FN) >l< (TN + FP) >l< (TN + FN)
Sensitivity = SENS = TP/(TP+FN) = TP/Ndigorder
Speciﬁcity = SPEC 2 TN / (TN + FF) 2 TN / Non]er
ACC = (SENS +SPEC)/2

 

 

Sw = (Wdisorder *TP — Worder * FP‘l‘ Worder *TN

— Wdisorder * FN)“ Wdisorder *N disorder + Worder *N order)

where TP is the number of true positives (correctly predicted disordered
residues). FP denotes false positives (ordered residues that were predicted as
disordered). TN denotes true negatives (correctly predicted ordered residues).
FN stands for false negatives (disordered residues that were predicted
ordered). Wdisorder is the total percent of ordered residues. Worder is the total
percent of disordered residues and Non]er and Ndigorder are the total number of
ordered and disordered residues. respectively. The SW and MCC values range
between —1 and l and they are equal zero when all residues are predicted to
be ordered or disordered. The higher the values of these measures the better
the predictions.

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to examine
the predicted probabilities. For each value of probability P achieved by a
given method (between 0 and 1). all the residues with probability equal to or
greater than P are set as disordered. and all other residues are set as ordered.
Next. the TP-rate and the FP-rate are calculated and we use the area under
the curve (AUC) to quantify the predictive quality.

We designed the proposed predictor (which includes selection of features
that are used to encode the inputs. parameterization of the Support Vector
Machine (SVM)-based classiﬁers and selection of the threshold for the
predicted disorder probabilities to obtain binary predictions) using 5-fold
cross validation on the MxD dataset. In this test. we divide the dataset into
ﬁve equal-sized subsets of protein chains. We use four of these subsets to
form a training dataset that is utilized to compute the model and the ﬁfth
subset constitutes the testing dataset that is used to perform the evaluation.
This is repeated ﬁve times. each time choosing a different subset to be the
test dataset. The test on the CASP 8 was performed using the model trained
on the MxD dataset.

2.4 Architecture

Predictions are performed using an ensemble of three SVM classiﬁers that
are designated to predict all disordered residues (SVMALL). and disordered
residues in long (330 residues) (SVMLONG) and short segments (<30
residues) (SVMSHORT). Each classiﬁer is designed individually. i.e. uses
different parameters and different set of input features (see Sections 2.5
and 2.6) computed from the IUPred. DISOclust and DISOPRED2
predictions. the sequence. the sequence proﬁles and the various relevant
sequence-based predictions. The latter predictions are performed using
methods chosen based on two criteria: (i) their quality is comparable
to the leading relevant predictors; and (ii) they provide a stand-alone
implementation that could be utilized to build an autonomous implementation
of the proposed disorder predictor. We utilize PSIPRED (McGufﬁn at (11..
2000) for the SS prediction. Real-SPINE3 for the prediction of the relative
solvent accessibility (RSA) and backbone dihedral torsion angles (Faraggi
at (11.. 2009). PROFbval for the B-factor prediction and residue ﬂexibility
prediction (Schlessinger at (11.. 2006) and RPSP for the signal peptide
prediction (Plewczynski at (11.. 2008). We also use IUPred to predict globular
domains. The selection of the SVM as the classiﬁers was motivated by its
prior extensive use in disorder prediction (Hirose at (11.. 2007; Ishida and
Kinoshita 2007. 2008; Peng et (11.. 2006; Shimizu et (11.. 2007a. b; Vullo.
et a1. 2006). We use a linear-kernel-based SVM introduced in Fan et a1.
(2008). The real-valued prediction is computed as a maximum among the
probabilities generated by SVMALL. SVMSHORT and SVMLONG (we combine
all predicted disordered residues) and the resulting value is binarized using
the threshold that equals 0.37. The value of the threshold was found using the
MxD dataset. We ‘smooth out” our binary predictions by ﬁltering out short
segments (52 residues). On the ﬁrst pass. we convert predicted ordered
residues in segments 52 residues to disordered residues with probability of
0.37. One the second pass. we reassign the short. 52 residues. segments of
disordered residues as ordered with probability of 0.369. The MFDp predictor
is shown in Figure l.

2.5 Feature space representation

The MFDp utilizes four complementary disorder predictors. IUPred LONG
(IUPREDL). IUPred SHORT (IUPREDS). DISOPRED2 and DISOclust;
the sequence. the PSSM proﬁle (Altschul at (11.. 1997). the predicted SS.
the predicted RSA. the predicted globular domains (IUPREDG). backbone
dihedral torsion angles and signal peptides. The predictors were run with
their default parameters. The PSSM proﬁles were generated using the non-
redundant (nr) database from NCBI (downloaded on November 19. 2009).
which was ﬁltered using PFILT (Jones and Swindells. 2002) to remove
low-complexity regions. transmembrane regions and coiled-coil segments.
We utilize a sliding window of size 15 centered over the predicted residue
to extract the features. We use the raw numerical values for each of the
15 positions. which include: the probability of the prediction of disordered
residues from IUPREDL. IUPREDS. DISOPRED2 and DISOclust; the
PSSM values; the probabilities of prediction of helix. coil and strand
conformations from PSIPRED; the predicted B-factor values; the predicted
solvent accessibility and backbone angles; and the binary values denoting
whether a given position in the window is predicted as a signal peptide.

When aggregating. we ignore the positions in the window that are outside
of the chain for the residues close to the sequence terminus. i.e. we sum
only the values for the positions in the chain and this sum is dived by the
total number of these positions. The features are divided into 17 categories
based on the source information used including sequence. PSSM. amino-acid
frequency. conservation. SS. RSA. torsion angles. DISOPRED2. DISOclust.

domains. strict ﬂexibility and non-strict ﬂexibility. Detailed description is
provided in the appendix at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MFDp.html.

2.6 Feature selection and parameterization of SVMs

We designed three SVMs using different versions of the MxD dataset. The
SVMALL was designed using the entire MxD dataset. while SVMLONG
and SVMSHORT were developed using the MxD dataset where the disorder
residues from short (<30 residues) and from long (330 residues) disorder
segments were removed. respectively. For each of the three models we used
the following procedure. In the ‘ﬁrst step” we remove all highly correlated
features within each of the 17 feature categories. For each feature we compute
its average biserial correlation (over ﬁve correlations computed from the ﬁve
training subsets of the MxD dataset) with the outcomes. i.e. annotation of
ordered and disorder residues. We sort the features in each category according
to their average biserial correlations. The set of the selected features is
initialized with the feature that has the highest biserial correlation. Next.

for each following features we calculate its average correlation (over the
ﬁve training subsets) with any of the features which were already selected.
and we add it to the set of selected features only if the correlation <0.9. We
discard the features that were not selected. In the ‘second step” we quantify
predictive quality of the features selected in the ﬁrst step using the linear
SVMs. We construct feature sets by selecting top 1 features. according to
their average biserial correlations. from each category. We take all features
in a given category if their number < Z. Next. we run 5-fold cross validation
on the MxD dataset where we vary the value of 1 between 1 and 15. and for
each I we parameterize the value of constant C of the linear SVM classiﬁers.
We consider C in consecutive powers of 2 between 2‘8 and 25 . For each of the
prediction models (ALL. LONG and SHORT) t = 1 provides the best values
of AUC in the 5-fold cross validation on the MxD dataset. Next. starting
from the least correlated feature from the selected 17 features. we removed a
given feature if it increases AUC value for the 5-fold cross validation-based
prediction on the MxD dataset; this lead to removal of the features related
to the annotation of the signal peptides. For the remaining relevant feature
categories. we attempt to add additional features which improve predictive
quality. For each of the remaining categories. starting with the category with
the most correlated feature. we keep adding features (starting with second-
best feature from the category) as long as the addition of a feature increased
the AUC value for the 5-fold cross validation on the MxD dataset. For
each removal/addition. we tuned the C parameter of the SVM. For the ALL
model. we selected 16 features from 11 categories; for the SHORT model.
we selected 30 features from 12 categories; and for the LONG model. we
have 17 features from 12 categories. The selected features are shown in
the Table l in the appendix at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MFDp.html. A
signiﬁcant fraction of the features (27 out of the entire set of 63) are based on
the aggregated information. which suggests that our features provide better
discriminatory power than the raw values. The selected features consider
almost all sources. except for the signal peptides annotations.

The entire process. including feature selection and SVM parameterization.
was consistently carried using 5-fold cross validation on MxD dataset.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison with existing predictors

We compare MFDp with relevant predictors on the MxD and CASP8
datasets. For the MxD dataset, we use 5-fold cross validation to
assess our predictions; we use 75% of each of the ﬁve training
subsets to compute SVMs, the other 25% to ﬁnd the threshold used
for binarization of the probabilities, and the test subsets to evaluate
predictions. In contrast, predictions from other method are generated
on the entire dataset (without cross-validation) using either web-
servers or stand-alone implementations provided by the authors.
For the test on the CASP8 dataset, the MFDp is trained, including
computation of SVMs (using the same parameters as for the MxD
dataset) and the selection of the threshold, using all fully disordered
and PDB chains in the MxD dataset; these chains have similar
disorder characteristics to the chains in the CASP8. The training
chains from the MxD dataset share at most 25% identity to any
chain the CASP8 set making it challenging to perform predictions.
On the contrary, the methods we compare with use large training
datasets that may share substantial similarity to the CASP8 targets
(i.e only ahandful of CASP8 target were consider as free-modeling),
which could raise their predictive quality.

The cross-validated predictions of MFDp are compared to its
input predictors, including: DISOPRED2; IUPredL and IUPredS
(IUPred predictions for short and long segments); DISOclust; and
PROFBval, and with selected other recent methods including the

We report the averages and corresponding SDs for bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions of 80% of chains. Underlined methods are used as inputs for MFDp. The methods are sorted
by the MCC values and the highest values are shown in bold. Results of tests of signiﬁcance of the differences between MFDp and the other methods are given in the ‘signiﬁcance’
columns. The tests compare average values from 1000 bootstrapping repetitions. The + and 7 mean that MFDp is statistically signiﬁcantly better/worse with P < 0.01, and =means

that results are not signiﬁcantly different.

consensus-based MD (Schlessinger et (11., 2009), the propensity-
based Ucon (Schlessinger et (11., 2007a) and the machine learning-
based NORSnet (Schlessinger et (11., 2007b). Our results on the
CASP8 dataset are also compared against ﬁve top-performing
methods in the CASP8 experiments (Noivirt-Brik et (11., 2009).
These methods are identiﬁed by the group number in square
brackets (as registered for the CASP8 meeting) and the group
name. They include GS-MetaServer2 [153], GeneSilicoMetaServer
[297], MULTICOM-CMFR [69] (Cheng et (11., 2005), DISOclust
[97] (McGufﬁn, 2008) and McGufﬁn [379], which is a human-
based consensus that uses DISOclust. More detailed description
of these predictors can be found in the CASP8 abstracts at
http://predictioncenter.org/casp8/doc/CASP8_book.pdf.

We compare predictive quality when considering all disordered
regions and for the regions that are at least 30 residues long,
respectively. The selection of the length threshold is consistent with
values used in the recent investigation of protein—protein recognition
mechanisms (Tompa et (11. 2009) and in design of predictors for
long segments (Han et (11. 2009; Peng et (11. 2006). The same as in
the CASP8, we discard the disordered regions with three or fewer
residues (Noivirt-Brik et (11., 2009; private correspondence with
authors), i.e. these residues are ignored when computing the quality
measures. Similarly, for the results on the long segments we discard
the shorter regions. Following the CASP8, predictions were assessed

using bootstrapping in which 80% of the targets were randomly
selected 1000 times and we report the corresponding averages and
standard deviations see Tables 2 and 3. We recomputed the results
for the CASP8 submissions and we found them consistent with the
original report (Noivirt-Brik et (11., 2009). We also analyze statistical
signiﬁcance of the differences between MFDp and the other
methods. We compared the 1000 paired average results for MCC,
SW and AUC obtained from using the bootstrapping with 80% of the
targets on both CASP8 and MxD datasets. Since the averages do not
follow normal distribution, as tested using Shapiro—Wilk test at the
0.05 signiﬁcance, we use Wilcoxon rank sum test and we measure
signiﬁcance of the differences at 0.01 level. Tables 2 and 3 show
that MFDp consistently outperforms all methods based on the MCC
index. These improvements are statistically signiﬁcant with P < 0.01
when compared with all considered competitors on both datasets and
for both all and long-disordered segments, except for NORSnet and
IUPREDL on the long regions and the CASP8 dataset. Results on the
MxD dataset demonstrate that MFDp signiﬁcantly outperforms its
input methods as well as MD, NORSnet and Ucon when considering
the SW and AUC values and for both all and long-disordered
segments. Only MD method is shown to be comparable with
respect to the AUC values. For the prediction of both all and long
segments on the smaller CASP8 dataset, the MFDp signiﬁcantly
improves over its input predictors, MD, NORSnet and Ucon for

the binary prediction measured using MCC and SW. The fact that
MFDp is successful in maintaining high-quality predictions for the
long segments is important given that predictors designed for long
disordered regions are usually less successful in predicting short
regions (Obradovic et (11., 2005; Peng et (11., 2005). Our method
is outperformed on the SW and AUC values for the prediction of
all segments by the top ﬁve CASP8 methods, but we signiﬁcantly
improve over these methods based on the MCC index. We also
signiﬁcantly improve over their binary assignments, measured with
MCC and SW, for the long-disordered segments. Our improvement
are achieved in spite of the fact that our training chains share
<25% identity to CASP8 targets, while the top predictors in CASP8
use training sequences that likely share more signiﬁcant similarity.
Moreover, the GS-MetaServer2 [153] and GeneSilicoMetaServer
[297] are unpublished and do not offer implementations/servers.
The McGufﬁn [379] method is not automated and requires human
expert and the DISOclust [97] results submitted to CASP8 are better
than the results generated by the stand-alone DISOclust provided to
us by the authors. The MFDp is available as an automated web
server at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MFDp.html. The ROCs for
the predictions on both datasets are shown in Figure 2. This ﬁgure
focuses on the FP rates <0.5; the entire curve is given in the
appendix at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MFDp.html. The curve
reveals that MFDp provides favorable TP rates for the FP values

between 0 and 0.4 on the MxD dataset and between 0.1 and
0.4 on the CASP8 dataset when compared with all predictors
except the top-performing methods in the CASP8. Our method
provides comparable TP rates for the FP rates >0.2 when compared
with the top performers from the CASP8 experiment. Overall, we
conclude that MFDp outperforms modern existing predictors for
binary disorder predictions and provides competitive real-valued
predictions.

3.2 Predictions of proteins with long-disordered
segments

We investigate the quality of our predictions applied to ﬁnd proteins
with long (330 residues)-disordered regions. This binary prediction
is motivated by the fact that this information is useﬁil for target
selection (Punta et (11., 2009; Slabinski et (11., 2007) and protein—
protein recognition (Tompa et (11., 2009). Similar evaluation was also
performed for the MD (Schlessinger et (11., 2009). Although ~43%
of disordered residues in CASP8 are in the long segments (allowing
for a relatively robust per-residues evaluations), there are only 15
such segments and thus we did not use this dataset. The results
on the MD dataset obtained using 5-fold cross validation for the
MFDp and the predictions from the servers for MD, DISOPRED2,
IUPred, NORSnet, DISOclust, Ucon and PROFbval are summarized

3.3 Case studies

We selected CASP8 target T0480 (PDBid 2K4X) which was solved
with NMR, and CASP8 target T0404 (PDBid 2DFE) which was
solved with X-ray crystallography, as our case studies. We compare
side-by-side prediction of MFDp, its input predictors DISOPRED2,
IUPred, DISOclust, the recent ensemble-based MD, and two top-
perforrning on the CASP8 (with respect to MCC) McGufﬁn
[379] and GeneSilicoMetaServer [297] methods (Fig. 4). For the
T0480, which is a small protein with ~50% disordered residues
located at sequence termini, MFDp ﬁnds both disordered segments,
achieves below-average MCC of 0.59 and improves over predictions
of its ensemble predictors. The MD over-predicts disorder and
GeneSilicoMetaServer generates predictions comparable to that of
MFDp. The T0404 includes 25% disordered residues with one longer
segment away from the termini. Most of the predictors ﬁnd both
disordered segments, and they also incorrectly annotate another
disordered segment at the N-terminus, except IUPREDL which
predicts only the middle segment. The GeneSilicoMetaServer and
MD slightly over-predict disorder, and the segment in the center
of the chain is most accurately predicted by MFDp, DISOPRED2
and McGufﬁn. Although these predictions should not be assumed
typical, they demonstrate that the MFDp can outperform all of its
input predictors.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The MFDp predicts disordered regions of all sizes and different
types. On average, it improves over the predictions of current
solutions for the binary disorder assignment and provides
competitive real-value predictions, as evaluated on two datasets with
low-sequence similarity. The MFDp’s outputs are also shown to
outperform other predictors for the identiﬁcation of proteins with
long-disordered regions. The main reasons for the improvements
are the application of a comprehensive set of information sources
including complementary disorder predictions, sequence proﬁles
and other relevant sequence-based predictors of structural and
functional protein characteristics, novel two-layer architecture
and the usage of custom features that aggregate raw prediction
inputs.

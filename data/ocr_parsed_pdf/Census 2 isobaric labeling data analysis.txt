ABSTRACT

Motivation: We introduce Census 2, an update of a mass spectrom-
etry data analysis tool for peptide/protein quantification. New features
for analysis of isobaric labeling, such as Tandem Mass Tag (T MT) or
lsobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ), have
been added in this version, including a reporter ion impurity correction,
a reporter ion intensity threshold filter and an option for weighted
normalization to correct mixing errors. TMT/iTRAQ analysis can be
performed on experiments using HCD (High Energy Collision
Dissociation) only, CID (Collision Induced Dissociation)/HCD (High
Energy Collision Dissociation) dual scans or HCD triple-stage mass
spectrometry data. To improve measurement accuracy, we imple-
mented weighted normalization, multiple tandem spectral approach,
impurity correction and dynamic intensity threshold features.
Availability and implementation: Census 2 supports multiple input
file formats including MS1/MS2, DTASelect, szML and perML. It
requires JAVA version 6 or later to run. Free download of Census 2
for academic users is available at http://‘fields.scripps.edu/census/
index.php.

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past decade, proteomic analysis by mass spectrometers
has become an essential tool for addressing important biological
questions. Initially, mass spectrometers were used to identify
components of a proteome, but now they are commonly used
to quantitate proteomic differences induced by different biolo-
gical conditions. Accurate quantitation beneﬁts from a higher
resolution mass spectrometer, which often reduces instrument
scanning speed. We previously reported the development of the
software Census that facilitates the quantitation of large prote-
omic datasets. Census (Park et al., 2008) was initially developed
to analyze MS data using metabolic labeling for quantitation,
but it is also capable of analyzing MS data with isobaric tags.
With the development of faster high-resolution mass spectrom-
eters, such as Thermo ScientiﬁcTM Velos LTQ-Orbitrap, Velos
LTQ—Orbitrap Elite, Q-Exactive and AB SCIEX Triple-TOF,
quantitation with isobaric tags has become more efﬁcient.

After the analysis of a large number of isobaric tag datasets,
we have improved Census for this increasingly popular quanti-
tation method.

2 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

Census 2 is composed of two parts: a quantitative analysis
module that builds chromatographs from spectra and calculates
ratios of relative peptide abundance or measures fragment ion
intensities (isobaric labeling), and a qualitative module that nor-
malizes peak intensities to correct sample mixing error, ﬁlter out
noisy peaks and perform triple-stage mass spectrometry (MS3)
quantitative analysis and dual scan analysis. Census 2 has been
developed in Java and is operating system independent. The user
can run Census 2 on personal Windows/Macintosh desktop com-
puter or deploy it onto a high performance server and run in
console mode for multiple users. Census 2 uses indices to access
mass spectral data by random ﬁle access to retrieve data quickly
without using a large amount of computer memory.

2.1 Data acquisition

Several different data acquisition approaches have been pro-
posed for quantitative analysis using either Tandem Mass Tag
(TMT) or Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute
Quantiﬁcation (iTRAQ). The combination of dual fragmenta-
tion methods for tandem spectral acquisition such as CID/
HCD can improve the number of identiﬁcations while optimiz-
ing collision energy for quantiﬁcation. Another approach is to
perform HCD in an MS3 scan to eliminate interference from co-
fragmenting peaks in the MSI isolation window.

2.1.] CID-HCD dual scans In CID-HCD dual scan conﬁgur-
ation, the selected parent ion is first fragmented by CID (for
peptide identiﬁcation) and then by HCD (for peptide quantiﬁ-
cation) (Kocher et al., 2009). Census 2 can analyze CID-HCD
dual scans to improve identiﬁcation sensitivity while allowing
accurate quantitative results. Users can define the number of
consecutive CID or HCD scans. Census 2 compares precursor
ions with properly matched corresponding scans.

2.1.2 MS3 quant In the method proposed by Ting et a]. (2011),
quantiﬁcation is performed using a MS3 HCD scan. We imple-
mented MS3-based quantitation in Census 2. Census 2 compares
precursor mass in MS2 and logged information in MS3 to prop-
erly match corresponding scans.

(TMT), respectively

2.2 Accurate measurement

For isobaric labeling, we have developed computational
algorithms to improve sensitivity of quantitative
measurements. Users can customize quantitative parameters in
the census_conﬁg.xml file.

2.2.] Weighted normalization Normalization in the quantitative
analysis is important to correct systematic errors, such as those
from imprecise sample mixing. Census 2 uses the fact that the
majority of proteins do not change abundance in standard well-
controlled experiments to correct reporter ion intensities. It
extracts reporter ion intensities for each channel and generates
distributions of intensities. Census 2 assigns different weights
based on overall intensities and calculates intensity correction
values (Taylor, 1982).

2.2.2 Multiple tandem spectra While repeated sampling of
the same ion does not beneﬁt identiﬁcations, each scan provides
independent quantitative information that can be harnessed to
increase accuracy from reporter ion intensity variance. For ex-
ample, running DTASelect2 with it 0 option generates redun-
dant scans to improve quantitative accuracy by increasing the
number of measurements (Tabb et al., 2002). In this way, Census
2 increases quantitative accuracy by removing errors from inten-
sity ﬂuctuation (Fig. 1).

2.2.3 Impurity correction Isotopic impurities in iTRAQ or
TMT reagents result in small but signiﬁcant bleeding into neigh-
boring reporter ion channels. As these impurities coincide with
and are indistinguishable from the neighboring reporter ions, the
quantitative results can be improved by correcting reporter ion
isotope values. The user can deﬁne correction values in percent-
ages as provided by the reagent manufacturers.

2.2.4 Dynamic intensity threshold The accuracy of quantitative
measurement is improved when higher reporter ion intensities
are used. Low intensity peaks that are close to background
noise can deviate from correct values. Figure 2 shows ratio
versus reporter ion intensity plot from HCD 1:1 mixture of
mouse liver lysate. Census 2 dynamically generates a distribution

eters such as a ~95% conﬁdence interval (u :I: 20).

3 SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTION

Since original Census was released, we have implemented add-
itional features and algorithmic improvements. In Census 2, iso-
baric labeling analysis is one of notable features we added. We
will continue enhancing Census 2 for new proteomic
technologies.

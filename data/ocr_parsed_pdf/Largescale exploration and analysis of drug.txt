Abstract

Motivation: Drug combinations are a promising strategy for combating complex diseases by im—
proving the efficacy and reducing corresponding side effects. Currently, a widely studied problem
in pharmacology is to predict effective drug combinations, either through empirically screening in
clinic or pure experimental trials. However, the large—scale prediction of drug combination by a sys—
tems method is rarely considered.

Results: We report a systems pharmacology framework to predict drug combinations (PreDCs) on
a computational model, termed probability ensemble approach (PEA), for analysis of both the
efficacy and adverse effects of drug combinations. First, a Bayesian network integrating with a
similarity algorithm is developed to model the combinations from drug molecular and pharmaco—
logical phenotypes, and the predictions are then assessed with both clinical efficacy and adverse
effects. It is illustrated that PEA can predict the combination efficacy of drugs spanning different
therapeutic classes with high specificity and sensitivity (AUC=0.90), which was further validated
by independent data or new experimental assays. PEA also evaluates the adverse effects
(AUC=0.95) quantitatively and detects the therapeutic indications for drug combinations. Finally,
the PreDC database includes 1571 known and 3269 predicted optimal combinations as well as their
potential side effects and therapeutic indications.

redundancy and multifunctionality, which limits the therapeutic op—
portunity of one gene—one drug applications (Fitzgerald et al., 2006;
Shaheen et al., 2001). Despite the increasing number of drug com—
binations in use, many of them were found in clinic by experience,
or experimentally derived by dose—response curves for each pair of
drugs against a protein target. The mechanistic understanding of
synergistic drug pairs remains largely elusive, which makes it diffi—
cult to propose new drug combinations.

Systematic surveys of combination drugs in vitro have been pro—
posed to investigate the synergistic drug pairs such as the high—
throughput screening method (Borisy et al., 2003; Lehar et al., 2009)
and the ‘multiplex screening for interacting compounds’ (Tan et al.,
2012). However, the large—scale experiments currently used to evalu—
ate the drug combinations are very time consuming simply because
they are severely dependent on the searches of a vast space of possible
target combinations (Cokol et al., 2011; Winter et al., 2012).
Alternatively, some computational approaches have been proposed
which aimed at using network analysis and chemical biology data to
identify novel combinatorial drugs (Chou, 2010; Tang et al., 2013;
Zhao et al., 2011). But most of them are often limited in their capabil—
ity to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms, or to extract the
information from a larger pharmacological space, or to associate the
targets with multiple diseases for combinatorial drugs.

Generally, simultaneous administration of two or more medica—
tions may result in significant drug—drug interactions (DDIs), lead—
ing to a high risk of adverse effects for patients (Manzi and
Shannon, 2005). DDIs may be pharmacokinetic or pharmacody—
namic (Jonker et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009). Previous work con—
cerns the prediction of DDIs, mainly relying on the pharmacokinetic
properties of the compound such as its solubility (Boobis et al.,
2002) or depending on pharmacodynamic constants (Huang et al.,
2013; Li et al., 2007) or handling both pharmacokinetic and phar—
macodynamic DDIs (Gottlieb et al., 2012). However, an up—to—date
combined analysis integrating both the efficacy and adverse effects
for known or novel drug pairs, which may provide the basis for fu—
ture clinical trials, is still lacking.

Recently, we have developed a set of systems pharmacology
strategies for systematic pursuit of optimal drug combinations.
These works lay foundations for a more comprehensive understand—
ing of pharmacological synergy in herbal medicine (Wang et al.,
2012) and the combination rule of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(Yao et al., 2013). Furthermore, a large—scale systematic analysis
combining pharmacokinetics, chemogenomics, pharmacology and
systems biology data was performed through computational meth—
ods and experimental validation, which results in a superior output
of information for systematic drug design strategies for complex dis—
eases (Li et al., 2014).

In this work, we propose a new systems pharmacology frame—
work consisting of a new algorithm termed probability ensemble ap—
proach (PEA), through integrating the molecular chemical space, the
pharmacological space, the gene annotations, in particular, the con—
nectivity of biological networks, to predict effective drug combin—
ations. In contrast to those previous studies mentioned above, the
novelty of PEA is threefold: (i) to the best of our knowledge, PEA
presents up to now the largest—scale unbiased prediction of effective
drug combinations based on a complete set of drug—combination,
drug—disease and drug—side effect relations; (ii) PEA also provides a
quantitative assessment of the therapeutic indications and side ef—
fects for each combination in clinical usage; (iii) to show the predict—
ive value of our approach, the predictions were benchmarked
against independent datasets and further tested using cancer cell and
antibacterial models.

2 Methods

2.1 Computational

We designed a novel algorithm termed PEA to integrate the molecu—
lar and pharmacological characteristics of drugs (Fig. 1). Given a
pair of query drugs, we firstly calculated its six similarity features to
a known drug pair including three drug—based and three target—based
similarity measures and combine them using a Bayesian network
into a likelihood ratio (LR) that represents its probabilistic similarity
to the known interaction. We then defined a raw score, as an esti—
mate of the overall similarity of the query drug pair, by summing its
LRs to all the known drug pairs in each set [either effective drug
combinations (EDCs) or undesirable drug—drug interactions
(UDDIs)] above a threshold LR. The raw score can be further con—
verted to a P value (ranging from 0 to 1) from a random raw score
distribution. This resulting P value represents the probability of a
given raw score that better to be observed from random data.
Because we trained our models separately for EDCs and UDDIs, the
likelihood that a query drug pair interacts is finally expressed as two
probabilities P1, P2 which reﬂect their reliabilities to be an EDC or
UDDI, respectively.

2.1.1 Drug—drug similarity measures

We defined and computed six drug—drug similarity measures includ—
ing the chemical similarity, the similarities based on side effects, the
anatomical therapeutic and chemical (ATC) classification system,
and the similarities between drug targets, represented by sequence
similarity, the distance on a protein—protein interaction (PPI) net—
work and gene ontology (GO) semantic similarity. All similarity
measures were normalized to be in the range [0, 1].

(1) Chemical based. The 2D chemical structures (Mol ﬁle format)
of the drugs were downloaded from DrugBank (Knox et al.,
2011 ). The hashed binary chemical ﬁngerprints were computed
using the Chemical Development Kit with default 2D param—
eters (Steinbeck et al., 2006). The ﬁngerprints were used to
compute the similarity score between two drugs using
Tanimoto coefﬁcient, that is, the size of the intersection div—
ided by the size of the union of the two ﬁngerprints.

(2) ATC based. The ATC classiﬁcation system established by the
WHO is used for the classiﬁcation of drugs (Skrbo et al.,
2004). This pharmaceutical coding system categorizes drugs
according to the organ or system on which they act and their
therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical characteristics. We
extracted ATC codes of the drugs from DrugBank.
Considering the hierarchical structure of ATC codes, we calcu—
lated the similarity scores between drugs using the semantic
similarity algorithm (Wang et al., 2003):

5(61'761) I W(CivC/')CXP (-V ' d(6i7€i)) (1)

where d (6,, 6,) represents the shortest distance between
ATC codes 6,- and c,- in the hierarchical structure of the ATC
classification system. (2(2) and c(t,-) represent the weights of the
corresponding ATC—codes, and are defined as the inverse of
ATC—code frequencies, which means that more emphasis was
put on specific codes rather than the general ones. y is a pre—
defined parameter (set to be 0.25 in this study).

(3) Side-effect based. Drug side effects were obtained from SIDER
(Kuhn et al., 2010), a public resource containing drug side—
effect information. We assigned a side—effect proﬁle to each
drug in our datasets, whose elements encode for the presence
or absence of each of the side—effect keywords by 1 or 0,

similarity scores between drugs according to the Tanimoto co—

Sequence based. Sequence—based similarity between two drug
target proteins was calculated based on the drug target—cen—
tered systems (Sharan et al., 2007). We deﬁned a system simi—
larity score (S—score) to describe the target sequence similarity
for two drugs (d,-, d,-) as the following:

where <','> is the inner product, PM: (130,1), P(1,2),"', PU, n),

bution of P“, k) by calculating the 10 000 P“, k) of two random
proteins. The A is 0.034 in this study. The normalized similar—
ity score between two drug target—centered systems is given by
dividing the S—score by the geometric mean of the scores ob—
tained from the S—score of each drug target—centered system
against itself.

PPI network based. The similarity between each pair of drug
target proteins in the human PPI network was calculated using
the drug target—centered systems connection (Sharan et al.,
2007). We ﬁrstly deﬁned a target—centered system for each
drug, which includes drug targets and their ﬁrst—step neighbor—
ing proteins in the PPI network. Finally, we deﬁned a system
connection score (S—score) to describe the connection between
target—centered systems for two drugs (d,-,d,-) in the PPI net—
work as the following:

< PM", Ci; >
V < Ciqi, Ci; >

where <','> is the inner product, PM: (130,1), P(1,2),"', Pu, n),
P(2,1), "', Pam), "', P(m,1), "', P(m,n)) is a  vector, in
which m and n are the target number of the drug 1' and i re—
spectively, and PWZ) is the similarity between two target based

is given by dividing the system connection score by the geomet—
ric mean of the scores obtained from the S—score of each drug
target—centered system against itself.

(6) GO based: Semantic similarity scores between drug targets
were calculated according to Resnik (2011), using the csbl.go
R package (Ovaska et al., 2008) selecting the option to use all
three ontologies.

2.1.2 Features for drug pairs

We defined six features (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 and F6) for drug pairs based
on the above drug—drug similarities to quantitatively describe the simi—
larities between drug pairs. To acquire the similarity of features be—
tween a query drug pair (d1, d2) and a known drug pair (d1’, d2’), we
first compute the drug—drug similarities S (d1, d1’) and S (d2, d2’) (and
symmetrically S (d1, d2’) and S (d2, d1’)). Then, the two similarities are
combined to a single feature similarity score by calculating their geo—
metric mean (Perlman et al., 201 1). The overall score is

F,(dp.dp’) : max M 2,1 4,; 501M119 -S(d2.d2’) (7)

2.1.3 Bayesian network for integrating features

To integrate the six features for a drug pair, i.e. F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 and
F6, we used a Bayesian networks approach, which was proved to be
competent in predicting PPIs by integrating evidence from different
sources (Jansen et al., 2003). Bayesian networks are a representation
of the joint probability distribution among multiple variables.
Formally, the feature F can be expressed as a LR, i.e. L (F), which is
defined as the fraction of gold—standard positives having feature F
divided by the fraction of negatives having F. For the six features F1,
F2, F3, F4, F 5 and F6, the LR of the combined evidence is the product
based on the naive Bayesian network:

L(F1  F6) : TIME) (8)

6
:1

This equation is produced as the six features are independent
from the analysis of Pearson correlation coefficients for each pair of
features (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). For each feature F,, its
LR relates prior and posterior odds according to the Bayes rule:

0
L F - : ﬂ (9)
( I) Oprior
where the ‘prior’ and ‘posterior’ odds are:
P(positive) P(positive)
Oprior : —. : —.. 
P(negatlve)  — P posmve)
O i P(posmvelF, (11)
p0“ _ P(negativelFi)

Among them, the terms ‘prior’ and ‘posterior’ refer to the situation
before and after knowing the feature F,. P (positive) and P (negative)
are the odds that a drug pair is in the positive set and in the negative
set, respectively. P (positivelF,) and P (negativelF,) are the probabilities
that a drug pair is in the positive set and in the negative set after
knowing that this drug pair has feature F,. This leads to:

P(Filpositive)
L F- : —, 12
( ') P(Filnegatlve) ( >
Here P (F,lpositive) and P (F,lnegative) refer to the probabilities
that a drug pair in the positives and the negatives has the feature F,,
respectively, and can be estimated by kernel density estimation

(KDE) method.

2.1.4 Kernel density estimation

KDE is a non—parametric way of estimating the probability density
function population. The probability PAR-(C: c) was estimated
using Equation:

 

1
mnm:dzﬁj§:ﬂﬁﬁw) a”
K(a. b) : L55”,an (14)

TI

where K is a Gaussian function kernel with mean zero and variance
1, NC represents the number of the input data F belonging to class c,
Fig-(C is the feature value in the ith position of the j—th input F: (F1
F2 . . . F,- . . . F") in class c, and b is a bandwidth, or a smoothing par—
ameter. To optimally estimate the conditional probabilities, b was
optimized on the training dataset.

2.1.5 Raw score and P value

To obtain a good estimate of the overall similarity with the positive
set for a drug pair, we first defined a raw score for this drug pair by
summing its combined LRs relative to all N drug pairs in positive set
with L,- 2 L5,”.

N
Rawscore : ZL,(F1 ... F6),(L,-2Lm) (15)
[:1

We determined the threshold Lcut by leave—one—out analysis. By
sampling across the range of Lcut choices, we chose the threshold
which led to the highest F1 score in cross—validation. Scores below
the LR threshold are discarded and do not contribute to the overall
set similarity.

Then, a model for the random LRs of the raw scores was de—
veloped and fit. A random raw score was calculated by comparing a
randomly selected drug pair to a random positive set (with the same
size) which was randomly populated from the drugs in the real posi—
tive set. We here generated overall n : 1 X 106 random raw scores,
and the probability of obtaining the same or better raw score by ran—
dom chance alone can be estimated by (Pearson, 1998):

A k

ngnz1—; HQ
where k is the amount of raw scores that are greater than r occurring
in the random distribution.

2.2 Experimental

We used a 10—fold cross validation scheme to evaluate the accuracy
of our prediction model. And we compared the performance of the
PEA algorithm with a K—Nearest Neighbors algorithm (or KNN for
short) which is a non—parametric method used for classification. We
benchmarked the prediction results against a number of independent
researches about drug combination. To further illustrate the power
and potential of our large—scale approach, a set of in vitro experi—
mental assays using anti—bacterial and cancer cell models were
applied, in which the DDIs characterizing the additivity and syner—
gism are quantitated based on the Chou—Talalay method (Chou,
2006). More details can be found in the Supplementary text.

3 MATERIALS

We collected drug combinations from three localities: (i) 300 com—
binations in the Drug Combination Database (DCDB) as of 2010

Drug combinations

 

(Liu et al., 2010); (ii) 97 combinations from the Therapeutic Target
Database Version 4.3.02(Zhu et al., 2010); and (iii) 1613 combin—
ations from Pubmed literatures (downloaded on September 27,
2012) by data mining through keywords ‘drug combination’, ‘drug
interaction’, ‘multi—drug’, ‘additive’, ‘antagonism’, ‘antagonistic’,
‘infra—additive’, ‘potentiated’, ‘potentiative’, ‘potentiation’, ‘reduc—
tive’, ‘supra_additive’, ‘synergism’, ‘synergistic’ and ‘synergy’, fol—
lowed by the actual reading of all full texts (Jia et al., 2009). We
then discarded drug combinations that are redundant (the same
combination extracted from different sources) and vague (the com—
binations with none or unclear efficacy). This led to 1571 drug com—
binations spanning 951 drugs. All these data are available at our
website (http://sm.nwsuaf.edu.cn/lsp/predc.php). The DDIs were ex—
tracted from DrugBank version 3 (Knox et al., 2011). The full list of
the DDIs contains 11 085 DDIs involving 1110 drugs. We manually
checked each DDIs and distinguished 1536 UDDIs from all these
DDIs. The UDDIs are defined as those in which two drugs can cause
an adverse effect, such as the increase of the toxicity or the decrease
of the effect.

The 2D chemical structures of the drugs were downloaded in
M01 file format from DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011). Drug targets
were obtained from the DCDB (Liu et al., 2010) and DrugBank
databases. Drug side effects were downloaded from the SIDER data—
base (Kuhn et al., 2010). Human PPI data were assembled from mul—
tiple sources (see Supplementary Text for details). Protein sequences
and GO annotations (Ashburner et al., 2000) were parsed from
Uniprot (Jain et al., 2009). Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
(ATC) codes of drugs were extracted from DrugBank (Knox et al.,
2011). Overall, we collected 656 EDCs spanning 375 drugs and
1536 UDDIS involving 313 drugs for which all six drug—drug simi—
larity measures could be computed.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Performance evaluation

To quantitatively assess the performances of the PEA model with all
six features or each single feature in predicting effective drug com—
binations, we used the 656 EDCs of our gold standard and per—
formed a 10—fold cross validation accompanied with the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. As a result, the model
with whole features (AUC : 0.90) exhibits better performance than
those with single feature (AUC:0.72—0.85) (Fig. 2a). Among the
six features, ATC has the most predicting performance
(AUC : 0.85). In order to check if ATC is a dominant contributor to
the model, PEA was further trained with the remaining five features
without considering the ATC one. Surprisingly, the resultant model
shows a very similar performance in predictions (AUC : 0.89) com—
pared to the whole—feature one, indicating that PEA is not biased by
the ATC parameter. Moreover, considering the high negative/posi—
tive ratio (238.6 >> 1) in samples, the precision recall (PR) curve
(Fig. 2b) was also applied to evaluate these models for highlighting
the differences of performance that might be lost in the ROC curve
analysis (Davis and Goadrich, 2006). It turns out that the whole—fea—
ture PEA achieves AUC: 0.15 and a high precision of 91%,
whereas the single—feature model never exceeds 50% precision,
including ATC.

A combinational use of drugs could cause complex either pharma—
codynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions, or both, which makes it
difficult to characterize its effectiveness and side effects (Sun et al.,
2013) and may, meanwhile, bring up additional health problems
(Zhao et al., 2013). Therefore, we further evaluated whether an

effective combination has possible adverse effects. Here, we applied
the PEA model with 1536 UDDIs to quantitatively characterize a
drug pair with respect to adverse effects. Resultantly, similar to the
previous case, the whole—feature model exhibits the optimal predic—
tions with AUC : 0.95 for ROC analysis and 0.36 (AUC) for PR ana—
lysis respectively, superior to any other models with single feature
(Fig. 2c and 2d). The high prediction accuracy for the whole—feature
PEA model indicates that the model is reasonable for predicting the
adverse effects of drug combinations. In addition and not surprisingly,
ATC is again not predictive for detecting the adverse effects of drug
combinations based on the PR curves (Fig. 2d). In view of that the
sparsely space of DDIs and the non—uniformly covered by experimen—
tal data, we have also calculated model accuracy for the drug combin—
ations by dividing drugs into ‘new drugs’ and ‘known drugs’. Drugs in
the training set are called ‘known’ whereas those not in the training
set are called ‘new’. Overall, the result showed that our model have a
better performance for the drug combinations consisted by known
drugs (ROC AUC : 0.88 and 0.91 for EDCs and UDDIs, respectively)
than those consisted by new drugs (ROC AUC: 0.76 and 0.71 for
EDCs and UDDIs, respectively). Still, the model has a good predictive
ability for the drug combinations consisted by ‘new’ drugs
(Supplementary Table S3).

Further, in order to verify the newly developed PEA algorithm,
the performance of this method to transform the predictive features
to objective activity (combination or adverse effect) is compared
with the K—nearest neighbor (KNN) method where k is determined
by cross—validation and then pick maximum performance k. After 5
folds of cross—validations, k: 6 was determined since it has the best
performance. Firstly, we calculated the overall similarity between a
query drug pair and all known EDCs (UDDIs) by simply multiplying
the six feature similarity scores (rather than using a Bayesian trans—
formation as in PEA), and then assigned the highest similarity score
to that query drug pair. The resulting ROC and PR AUC scores of
the KNN model trained on the EDC set are 0.79 and 0.04, respect—
ively, which have been considerably outperformed by the new PEA

algorithm. In addition, the model trained on UDDIs also obtains
similar inferior results with the ROC and PR AUC scores of 0.85
and 0.13, respectively. All this demonstrates the feasibility of our
method in dealing with drug combinations, which is thus further
employed for predicting new effective drug pairs with undesirable
adverse effects in consideration.

4.2 Integrative analysis of side—beneficial effects for
drug combinations
To maximize the therapeutic effects and minimize the adverse effects
of drug treatment, the recognition and quantification of the situ—
ation, in multiple dimensions, is a critical prerequisite. The integra—
tive analysis of side—beneficial effects would enable us to analyze the
relationships between them for drug combinations and also to evalu—
ate the functional consequences of the same to different disease—
associated treatment. Here, for each query drug pair, PEA model
outputs two values: P1 and P2 to represent its effectiveness and per—
niciousness, respectively. To visualize these two quantitative stand—
ards, we first constructed a binary diagram of known EDCs (green
dots) and UDDIs (red dots) (Fig. 3a). We observed that PEA has high
recall rates with bigger P1 and lower P2, confirming P value as an
appropriate measure of the odds of a real interaction. In addition,
the disease distributions with respect to P1 and P2 indicate that cur—
rent drug pairs (known EDCs) have higher P1 (0.8—1.0) and lower
P2 (0.0—0.2), and mainly focus on infection, cancer, nervous system
disease and cardiovascular disease. Conservatively, we here selected
P value as 0.9 throughout our analysis. The EDCs and UDDIs are
intensively apportioned in two distinct areas: the (I, II) quadrant
(P1 > 0.9) for EDCs and (II, III) quadrant (P2 > 0.9) for UDDIs, re—
spectively. The recall rates are 67 and 82% for the two quadrants,
respectively, further proving the reliability and validity of PEA.
Next, we applied PEA to predict novel drug combinations.
To visualize the prediction results, we drew a heat map of all the
156 520 unknown drug pairs with the two values: P1 and P2
(Fig. 3b). Figure 3b shows that drug pairs in the quadrant 1 are

 

 
 
 
 
     

  

 

 

 

regarded as effective drug combinations. The ideal drug combin—
ations mainly cluster in the quadrant 1’ involving 3269 (2.1%) pairs
with P1 > 0.9 (a high probability of synergism) and P2< 0.1 (low
probability of causing adverse effects). Here, the critical standard
for initialing the P values for the quadrant n’ (n : 1, 3, 4) is to assure
the prediction accuracy with high confidence in each quadrant. In
order to validate the quadrant 1’ efficiency, we benchmarked the
predictions against an independent dataset (see later for details) and
also experimentally examined 44 predicted drug pairs from this re—
gion. As a result, 35 drug pairs (79.5%) are demonstrated effective
(as seen in Supplementary Table S4). The drug combinations in
quadrant 2 should be warranted in clinic as they are more likely to
cause unwanted adverse effects although they might be effective. For
example, voriconazole and itraconazole (P1 20.96, P2: 0.97) are
synergistic in treating infections caused by Fusarium (Spader et al.,
2013), but the combination of these two drugs may cause a danger—
ous abnormal heart rhythm (RxList, 2008). Drug pairs in quadrant
3 have a high probability to cause undesirable DDIs. These pairs
strongly intend to produce adverse effects (P2 > 0.9), but with low
possibility to become an effective combination (P1 < 0.1). Quadrant
4’ components have both small P1 and P2 values, which suggests
that there is a small chance of interactions between the two drugs in
one drug pair. In addition, looking specifically at the 3269 optimal
drug combinations, their associations with specific diseases is in
good agreement with the interest of current combination therapies
for complex and chronic diseases (Fig. 3c).

4.3 External literature validation

To validate the reliability of our method, we further check whether
the predicted drug pairs were validated in external literatures which
were not used to build the training dataset for the PEA model. The
experiment types, effectiveness, diseases and adverse effects of the
predicted drug combinations were manually collected from an un—
biased survey of the literature (See Supplementary Table S5)
Overall, we obtained detailed information about 642 novel drug

combinations. Surprisingly, 84% of which are consistent with our
predictions. Among the 537 effective predictions directly supported
by the literature, 69% have already entered clinical trials and 45
drug combinations were proved to be effective in at least two experi—
ment types (Fig. 4a). Moreover, 85% of the drug combinations vali—
dated by cell assays have a synergistic effect (Fig. 4b).

To put our finding into context, we divided the drugs into differ—
ent drug classes based on their third level of ATC code and com—
puted the proportion of verified drug combinations in predicted
ones within and between drug classes. We then calculated the sig—
nificance (by P—value using Fisher’s exact test) of overrepresentation
against the background incidence of the respective drug class. The
P—values were then adjusted to control for multiple hypothesis test—
ing, yielding q—values. More formally, q—values represent the min—
imum false discovery rate for which the connection will be regarded
as significant. To find out which drug class connections have a high
verified rate, we utilized the significant (q—value < 0.05) drug class
connections to create a drug class combination network. We filtered
connections that are involved with at least 10 predicted drug com—
binations and with a verified proportion greater than 0.3.

In total, we found 65 statistically significant drug—class connec—
tions between 41 drug classes, the majority of which are inter—class
connections, indicating that most of the predicted drug combin—
ations consist of drugs belonging to different drug classes (Fig. 4c).
Analysis of the known EDCs in drug classes also shows similar re—
sults (Supplementary Fig. S1). The drug class J05A (direct acting
antiviral drugs), which has 45 predicted drug combinations in it, has
the highest proportion of the verified drug combinations (64%, q—
value:7><1079). Following on are combinations between D07X
(corticosteroids, other combinations) and R03A (adrenergics, inhal—
ants) (60%, q—value : 0.024). Interestingly, there is actually no ef—
fective drug combinations (EDCs) consist of drugs belong to D07X
and R03A in our gold—standard dataset (Supplementary Table S6).
These results further indicated that the PEA model was not biased
by the ATC code similarity between drugs, but provided a weighted

similarity measurement which took all drug molecular and pharma—
cological features into account. There are 20 drug—class connections
have a verified proportion greater than or equal to 50%, which indi—
cates that a half or more than a half of our predictions consist of
drugs between these drug classes have gained direct supports of cer—
tain literature. The full list of the verified proportion and q—values
between or within drug classes is provided in Supplementary Table
S6. The connection between drug classes L01X (other antineoplastic
agents) and L01B (antimetabolites), which is the most connected
one between drug classes (36%, q—value : 2.3 X 1075), has 102
drug combinations in it. This result indicates that drugs in these two
drug classes have a larger chance to combine with each other to cre—
ate synergy. The L01X class mainly includes platinum compounds
and protein kinase inhibitors, which have been used widely in cancer
combination therapy (Dancey and Sausville, 2003; Lee et al., 2008).

4.4 Experimental validation

In total, we examined 102 novel predicted drug pairs, resulting in
the confirmation of 77 effective combinations (~75 % of all tested
drug pairs) (Supplementary Table S11). In the cancer model, we
examined 55 predicted drug pairs against the human non—small cell
lung cancer A549 cells. Resultantly, 39 of these pairs are found ef—
fective (~71% accuracy), among which 34 cases are synergistic and
5 are additive (Supplementary Table S7). For anti—bacterial model,
47 drug pairs were tested by Staphylococcus anrens and Escherichia
coli. We validate that 38 pairs (~81% of all 47 antibacterial pairs)
are effective (Supplementary Tables S8 and S9). Among them, 9
drug pairs exhibit activities (synergy or additivity) against both bac—
terial species. More details can be found in the Supplementary text.

5 DISCUSSION

A major challenge in predicting the drug combination in a large
scale is to achieve the desired prediction accuracy while dealing with

the complex conditions of missing data, different data types, unclear
mechanisms, etc. One means to achieve this is to exploit a large
database with sufficient information for drug combinations and a
method that distinguishes the therapeutic efficacy from adverse ef—
fects that may make it feasible to more precisely select the optimal
combinations. The incompleteness of target network information
and the scarceness of the side effect features hinder the application
of computational approaches to drug combinations (Brouwers et al.,
2011). Compared with the present available models (Zhao et al.,
2011), the PEA algorithm shows several major advantages, such as
high training efficiency and extensive applicability. More particu—
larly, PEA provides two quantitative indexes to describe the prop—
erty of a drug combination, which is convenient and easy to
understand.

PEA is specifically designed to accommodate those missing data
and differing types of variables and handle unbalanced multiclass
datasets. By integrating the weakly predictive features, such as
Target sequence, Chemical structure, etc., PEA exhibits similar per—
formances as the whole—feature model. The major reason is due to
that Bayes algorithm extracts the underlying pattern of features by
converting features to a common probabilistic framework so as to
improve the performance of the ensemble—based scoring approach.
In detail, Bayesian network algorithm transforms the features to a
LR, which provides probabilistic scoring for drug combinations in
an ensemble. The ensemble score is further converted to a P value
based on a random raw score distribution to calculate the reliability
for a predicted drug pair. In contrast to conventional method, where
an optimal combination is often determined by comparing the simi—
larity with a single known reference (Gottlieb et al., 2012), the en—
semble approach compares a probability distribution of a query
drug pair with all related combinations, resulting in the improve—
ment of generalization ability of the PEA tool. However, the simple
feature—enrich method (Zhao et al., 2011), as well as the one—nearest
neighbor, may not be capable of dealing with this complex system
due to the unadaptability and information loss. In addition, it
should be noted that we just calculated the protein global similarity
instead of the drug binding regions (Konc and Janezic, 2014). Our
considerations are: (i) sequence similar proteins might have similar
functions, since they might be homologs. However, similar drug
binding regions may not reveal whether the two proteins are func—
tionally similar; (ii) the analyses of drug binding regions are nor—
mally dependent of the crystal structures, which severely limits the
algorithms for more general applications. And more importantly,
even we have obtained the structures; we still need to define which
amino acids are involved in drug binding, since different drugs might
bind to different amino acids in most cases even in the same pocket
for the same protein.

The present computational solution considers drug actions and
their clinical effects in the context of molecular network systems,
which provides information for further understanding of the mo—
lecular mechanism and pharmacological effect underlying drug com—
binations. Generally, due to the unclearness of the molecular
mechanisms underlying combination therapies, most drug combin—
ations are inferred based on sets of clinical rules derived from clin—
ical experience or randomized clinical trials. For example,
combination therapy for hypertension has been assigned some pre—
ferred combinations from various classes of antihypertensive medi—
cations, such as renin—angiotensin—aldosterone system (RAAS)
inhibitor + diuretic, RAAS inhibitor + calcium channel blocker
(CCB), and CCB + diuretics (Salahuddin et al., 2013). Although
these conventional rules facilitate searching for valid combinations,
they limit this search into drug entities with similar functions, that

is, drugs in combinations often have the same first level of the ATC
code. This is confirmed by the fact that majority (~70%) of known
1571 drug combinations in our dataset belong to the same thera—
peutic category (from the first to fifth level of the ATC code)
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

To analyze whether PEA could overcome this limitation, we
have counted the predicted EDCs in the database that are composed
by drugs with different ATC classes (the first level). Extremely inter—
esting, we found 43% of our high—confidence predictions (with
P1 20.9 and P2301) are such kind of combinations, indicating
that our model is not restrained by the functional similarity between
two drugs for a combination. The benchmark dataset also shows
that 121 such combinations have been proved to be effective.
Moreover, we have experimentally validated 10 novel EDCs that
are combined by antibacterial and anticancer drugs (Supplementary
Tables S6—S8). The results show that 80% pairs are synergistic to
cancer models. For example, the antibacterial agent, tetracycline, as
a bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit inhibitor, displays synergistic
cytotoxicity against A549 cells when being combined with some
anticancer drugs, such as the DNA synthesis inhibitor ﬂudarabine
(CI 0.49), cross—linking reagent cisplatin (CI 0.69) and protein kin—
ase inhibitor imatinib (CI 0.80). It is worth noting that the ‘wet’ ex—
periment could only found ~16 % (38/200) synergistic pairs in
antifungal test (Cokol et al., 2011), which partially proves that the
PEA algorithm carries out high efficiency prediction in practice.

Various approaches have been suggested to benefit—risk assess—
ment during the development of new medicines (Eichler et al., 2008;
Garrison et al., 2007), but little has been reported of being applied
on the combinational drugs, though they have attracted more and
more interests from researchers and industry in recent years. Drug
combinations may overcome the side effects by countering network
robustness and bypass compensation, and thereby increasing the
clinical efficacy while minimizing the overlapping toxicity and
allowing reduced dosage of each compound (Jia et al., 2009;
Ramaswamy, 2007). The efficacy and side effect are normally
coupled together, and the best end results actually depend on the
side effects contributing to the overall therapeutic benefit. Thus, the
decision to take a drug combination depends upon the benefit—risk
weighting of all the potential risks and benefits, which up to date are
still extremely difficult to predict on a global scale. The complex
DDIs in multiple dimensions pose modeling challenges to classical
linear approaches, as well as hinder the targeted experimental
approaches due to a combinatorial explosion both in the pharmaco—
logical and molecular spaces.

In an effective combinatorial setting, the PEA algorithm has
incorporated the clinical efficacy and adverse effect evaluation into
the current model, resulting in two standards, i.e. P1 and P2. The
combined evaluation for a predicted combination opens new av—
enues of drug combination and even guides the drug dosage. For ex—
ample, the ﬂudarabine + tetracycline combination with high P1
(0.87) and low P2 (0.36) shows a significant synergistic effect (CI
0.46) on A549 cells. By lowering the dosage of ﬂudarabine (from
0.08611 11M to 0.03538 11M at the 50% cytotoxicity level), tetracyc—
line also reduces the risk of opportunistic infections induced by ﬂu—
darabine. More importantly, those combinations with low P1 and
high P2 predicted by PEA should be very carefully applied in practice
due to their uncertain inﬂuence on the efficacy and safety of drug
co—administration. For example, the monoamine oxidase (MAO) in—
hibitor, tranylcypromine, may increase the vasopressor effect of the
alpha1—agonist, midodrine, whose P1 and P2 are 0.055 and 0.993,
respectively. Thus, concomitant use of these two drugs should be
avoided.

One limitation for this work is that the dosage is not taken into
account in the model. Till now, two methods are in common use for
calculating the expected dose—response relationship for drug com—
bination as compared to mono—therapy: Loewe additivity and Bliss
independence (Fitzgerald et al., 2006). They both need experiments
to characterize drug combinations. Therefore, following in silico
studies should focus not only strategies for predicting drug combin—
ations but also improving the efficiency of trials.

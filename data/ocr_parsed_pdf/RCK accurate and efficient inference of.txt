Abstract

Motivation: Protein—RNA interactions, which play vital roles in many processes, are mediated
through both RNA sequence and structure. CLIP—based methods, which measure protein—RNA
binding in vivo, suffer from experimental noise and systematic biases, whereas in vitro experi—
ments capture a clearer signal of protein RNA—binding. Among them, RNAcompete provides
binding affinities of a specific protein to more than 240 000 unstructured RNA probes in one experi—
ment. The computational challenge is to infer RNA structure— and sequence—based binding models
from these data. The state—of—the—art in sequence models, Deepbind, does not model structural
preferences. RNAcontext models both sequence and structure preferences, but is outperformed by
GraphProt. Unfortunately, GraphProt cannot detect structural preferences from RNAcompete data
due to the unstructured nature of the data, as noted by its developers, nor can it be tractany run on
the full RNACompete dataset.

Results: We develop RCK, an efficient, scalable algorithm that infers both sequence and structure
preferences based on a new k—mer based model. Remarkably, even though RNAcompete data is
designed to be unstructured, RCK can still learn structural preferences from it. RCK significantly
outperforms both RNAcontext and Deepbind in in vitro binding prediction for 244 RNAcompete ex—
periments. Moreover, RCK is also faster and uses less memory, which enables scalability. While
currently on par with existing methods in in vivo binding prediction on a small scale test, we dem—
onstrate that RCK will increasingly benefit from experimentally measured RNA structure profiles as
compared to computationally predicted ones. By running RCK on the entire RNAcompete dataset,
we generate and provide as a resource a set of protein—RNA structure—based models on an unpre—
cedented scale.

1 Introduction

 

Protein—RNA interactions play vital roles in many processes in the
living cell (Rinn and Ule, 2014). These include modulation and ef—
fect of a Wide variety of cellular processes, including RNA replica—
tion, repair, recombination and post—transcriptional regulation
(Rinn and Ule, 2014). More than 1500 genes in the human genome
are thought to code for RNA—binding proteins (RBPs), making this
family one of the largest families in the human proteome
(Gerstberger et (11., 2014). Most RBPs bind RNA through both
sequence and structure. Thus, better characterization of RBP

sequence— and structure—specific binding preferences can improve
our understanding of post—transcriptional gene regulation.

RNA structure is commonly considered at the level of secondary
structure (Washietl et (11., 2012). RNA secondary structure is repre—
sented by base—pairing of nucleotides, and can be efficiently pre—
dicted from its sequence when only tree—like structures are allowed.
A single RNA molecule may fold into different conformations,
termed its ‘ensemble’ of structures, Where the most likely one is the
minimum free energy structure (Steffen et (11., 2006). These ensem—
bles can be represented as either different combinatorial structures

(represented as graphs by RNAshapes (Janssen and Giegerich,
2014)) or average probabilities over the ensemble (represented as
position—specific probability vectors by RNAplfold (Lorenz et al.,
2011)). New experimental methods for protein—RNA binding, such
as icSHAPE, can probe RNA structure both in vitro and in vivo
(Spitale et al., 2015). In many cases, the exact base—pairing is not as
informative as the structural context: whether the binding site is in a
loop, external region or base—paired (Leontis et al., 2006). A com—
mon assumption is that most proteins prefer to bind accessible sites
(i.e. those that are unlikely to be base—paired), and a few prefer a
specific structural context (Li et al., 2014; Ray et al., 2009).

New experimental high—throughput (HTP) techniques have been
developed to uncover protein—RNA interactions on a genome—wide
scale at single—nucleotide resolution. For example, HITS—CLIP,
CLIP—seq and RIP—seq measure protein—RNA interactions in vivo in
a HTP manner (Kénig et al., 2012). However, protein RNA—binding
is inﬂuenced by a variety of factors, such as other RBPs, which either
compete for the same binding site or co—bind as a complex, and
RNA structure. In addition, experimental output is significantly af—
fected by technological artifacts and noise (Fu and Ares, 2014;
Kishore et al., 2011). While the end goal is to understand and pre—
dict in vivo binding, in vitro experiments currently have higher reso—
lution and less noise. Moreover, as accurate experimental
measurements of RNA structure are scarce, methods rely on compu—
tational prediction of RNA structure, which is more accurate
in vitro than in vivo (Rouskin et al., 2014). Thus, in vitro experi—
ments provide valuable complementary information that may enable
us to learn intrinsic protein RNA—binding preferences.

Towards this aim, high—throughput in vitro methods have been
developed to study the binding preferences of RBPs (Lambert et al.,
2014; Ray et al., 2009). A prime example is RNAcompete (Ray
et al., 2009), in which a specific protein binds to a set of pre—designed
oligos and binding is measured by hybridization to complementary
probes on a microarray. The experimental output includes binding
intensities to more than 240 000 probe sequences. These sequences,
divided uniformly into Set A and Set B, together cover each RNA 9—
mer at least 16 times. The first study of 9 experiments included sets
of sequences from some structured RNA probes (Ray et al., 2009). In
the second study the probes were designed as unstructured to be ac—
cessible for the protein to bind (Ray et al., 2013). The latter study re—
ported the binding of more than 200 human RBPs and provided the
first—of—its—scale dataset of protein—RNA binding measurements (Ray
et al., 2013). However, only sequence—based binding models were
inferred from those due to the probes’ unstructured design.

Several methods have been developed to infer sequence— and
structure—based models for protein—RNA binding. MEMERIS was
the pioneer method (Hiller et al., 2006) to explore binding sites in un—
paired regions by extending the well—known MEME (Bailey et al.,
2015) to incorporate unpaired nucleotide probabilities. A more re—
cently developed method, RNAcontext, infers a PWM model and
structural context preferences from RNAcompete and CLIP data
(Kazan et al., 2010). RNA structure is represented as probabilities of
structural contexts (paired, hairpin loop, multi loop, inner loop and
external), predicted by RNAplfold (Lorenz et al., 2011). The state—
of—the—art in discovering structure— and sequence—based binding pref—
erences is GraphProt (Maticzka et al., 2014). The secondary structure
of each RNA sequence is represented as combinatorial graphs. Up to
three most—probable structures are predicted per sequence using
RNAshapes (Janssen and Giegerich, 2014). Graph—based support
vectors (Costa and De Grave, 2010) are used to train a model, where
the features are local subgraphs (representing base—paired and adja—
cent nucleotides) and hyper—graphs (representing structural contexts).

Unfortunately, both GraphProt and RNAcontext have clear limi—
tations in predicting protein—RNA binding. The prediction of highly
probable combinatorial structures, as in GraphProt, while saving
time, may not reveal the full ensemble of possible structures; the ag—
gregation of less likely structures has been shown to be more inform—
ative of RNA—binding than minimum free energy structures (Li
et al., 2014). On the other hand, while RNAcontext uses structural
context probabilities to represent the complete ensemble of possible
structures, its sequence model is a position weight matrix (PWM),
which is inherently position independent; every position in the
model contributes independently to binding. Thus, PWMs cannot
model dependencies between binding site positions, as opposed to
GraphProt, where subgraph features encode sets of nucleotides with
their structural relationships.

To resolve these issues, we present a new algorithm RCK (short
for RNAcontext—k—mer) (see Fig. 1). We follow the intuition that
RNA—binding preferences require more complex models, incorporat—
ing both sequence and structure. The algorithm extends
RNAcontext by a k—mer sequence— and structure—based binding
model. In particular, RCK uses the same input and optimization
procedure as RNAcontext to infer model parameters, but in a k—mer
based context that better captures local preferences, and a more effi—
cient implementation. We applied our algorithm to RNAcompete
data and inferred, for the first time, structure—based models from
this large—scale data of protein—RNA binding, as previous methods
were not applied due to design limitations based on the unstructured
nature of the data. We show that our method significantly outper—
forms both the sequence—based and structure—based state—of—the—art
methods for in vitro binding prediction. It is also much more effi—
cient, both in running time and memory usage, which is what en—
ables scalability to larger datasets and more complex binding
models. While in our limited tests RCK is on par with extant meth—
ods in predicting in vivo binding based on predicted RNA structure,
we demonstrate that RCK can easily incorporate experimentally
measured RNA structure to improve in vivo binding prediction.

2 Methods

2.1 RCK k—mer model for protein—RNA binding

We extended the model of RNAcontext (Kazan et al., 2010) to ac—
count for k—mer sequence and structure preferences. First, we define
a structural probability vector for sequence 5 to be a vector of length
)5) where each element is a distribution over the possible structural
contexts (e.g. paired and unpaired) in that position. The model as—
sumes that the binding intensity to k—mer w with structural probabil—
ity vector p is a multiplication of its sequence and structure
preferences, modeled by (9:

Fig. 1. A flowchart depicting the input, output and function performed by RCK. To infer a new binding model, RCK receives as input an RNAcompete dataset (Ray
err-1L, 2009), containing thousands of sequences and corresponding binding intensities, together with predicted structure probabilities of the probe sequences
(by RNAplfold (Lorenz er al., 2011)). RCK learns a sequence- and structure-based binding model, which can be later used to predict binding intensities of new
RNA sequences, for which structure has been experimentally measured (Spitale er al., 2015) or computationally predicted

context a, and by, is the structure bias. In both (2) and (3), a is the 10—
gistic function: 0(x) = (1 + exp(—x))_1. The bias terms, [75 and by,
are meant to scale the sequence and structure preferences. For ex—
ample, if structure does not play a significant role in binding, 17!,
may take a large positive value.

The binding score of sequence S with structural probability vec—
tor P is:

ISI-k

f(S:P:®) = 1 — H 1 — N(St+1zt+k7Pt+1zt+k2®) (4)
t=0

where St+1,t+k and Pt+1,t+k are the le—long sub—vectors starting at
index t+ 1 of S and P, respectively. The assumption is that every
position in sequence S has an independent probability of being
bound. The probability of sequence S not being bound, is the prod—
uct of not binding at any position.

2.2 Parameter inference

The model parameters are inferred to reduce the error in probe in—
tensity prediction. For N sequences S = {$1, . . . ,SN } with structure
probability vectors P = {[21, . . . ,pN}, measured binding intensities

R = {r1, . . . ,rN} and predicted intensities R = {?1, . . . ,rN}, where

r‘ = oc~ (5i,pi,(9) + ,8, we optimize the parameters (9 to minimize

the sum of squared errors:

N

E(®,oc,/3) = (r 4‘52 +6 2 «125+ a.) <5)
‘ 1 4),,69

The least squares cost function E((9,oc,ﬁ) is minimized using
the L—BFGS method (Byrd et al., 1995). Note that we modified the
regularization term to suit the new model. Regularizing by the sum
of le—mer sequence scores is intended to have few le—mers with high
scores and most le—mers with close—to—zero scores.

2.3 RNA secondary structure prediction

RNA secondary structural context profiles were predicted
using a variant of RNAplfold (Lorenz et al., 2011). In this vari—
ant, probabilities for four structural contexts are calculated per
position: hairpin loop, inner loop, multi loop and external
region (Kazan et al., 2010). The probability for a position being
paired is assigned, so that the total sum is 1. These probabilities,
represented as 5 vectors, each the length of the sequence, are pro—
vided together with the sequences as input to RCK and
RNAcontext.

2.4 Evaluating model performance

To evaluate the new k—mer model, we used the original dataset on
which RNAcontext was developed (Kazan et al., 2010). This dataset
included nine paired experiments, each pair testing a different pro—
tein (Ray et al., 2009). For each pair, we trained the model on ex—
periment A and tested on experiment B. We gauged the performance
by the Pearson correlation of measured and predicted binding inten—
sities. To be able to see the performance gain irrespective of model
width (i.e. k), we ran RCK and RNAcontext on width 5.

2.5 Running time evaluation

We measured RNAcontext, GraphProt and RCK training runtimes
and memory usage on the RNCMPTOOOOlzsetA dataset. We gauged
the user running time, excluding structure prediction times. Time
and memory usage were measured using the /usr/bin/ time com—
mand in Unix. User time and maximum resident set size are re—
ported. Running times and memory usage were benchmarked on a
single CPU of a 20—CPU Intel Xeon E5—2650 (2.3 GHz) machine
With 384 GB 2133 MHz RAM.

We ran GraphProt in the following way: perl GraphProt .pl
—mode regression —fasta <sequence file> —affinities
<intensities file>. RCK and RNAcontext were run with de—
fault parameters and model width 5.

2.6 In vitro binding prediction evaluation

To evaluate the performance of algorithms on in vitro binding pre—
diction we used the RNAcompete dataset (Ray et al., 2013). The set
includes 244 experiments, each containing binding intensities to
more than 240 000 sequences. The sequence set was designed as a
union of two sets, A and B, such that each has similar k—mer cover—
age. For each experiment, we trained a model on sequences from set
A and predicted the intensities on set B. Performance was deter—
mined by the Pearson correlation of predicted and measured inten—
sities of set B. Outlier intensities were clamped as done in the
Deepbind study (Alipanahi et al., 2015): all intensities above the 0.5
percentile were clamped to the value of the 0.5 percentile.

Five methods were compared in this evaluation. Sequence—based
methods included: PWMs from Ray et al. (Ray et al., 2013),
MatrixREDUCE (Foat et al., 2006) and Deepbind (Alipanahi et al.,
2015). Results were taken from (Alipanahi et al., 2015). Structure—
based methods included RCK and RNAcontext. For both, model
width was optimized by a simple 2—fold cross—validation on the
training set. Width ranges of RNAcontext and RCK were 4—12 and
4—6, respectively.

2.7 In vivo binding prediction evaluation
To evaluate the performance of algorithms on in vivo binding pre—
diction we used the dataset curated in the GraphProt study
(Maticzka et al., 2014). 24 CLIP experiments were collected, each
providing a set of in vivo binding sites. For them, control sequences
were extracted from unbound regions of the same bound transcripts.
Both binding sites and control sequences were ﬂanked by 15 Ont on
both ends. The overlap with RNAcompete in vitro data included 23
pairs of CLIP and RNAcompete experiments, covering 10 proteins
(Supplementary Table S3). We trained a model on a complete
RNAcompete experiment and tested its prediction accuracy in rank—
ing binding sites higher than control sequences. We reported the
average AUC over the pairs of experiments for each protein.

RCK and RNAcontext model width was optimized in a conven—
tional 2—fold cross—validation. Width ranges were 4—6 and 4—12, re—
spectively. To account for different sequence lengths, scores for each

sequence were assigned by averaging over the k—mer scores in that
sequence. RNAplfold was run on the sequences and its ﬂanks, while
only the sequence and its predicted probabilities were used for test—
ing. Deepbind was run with the ‘—average’ option to average k—mer
scores over a sequence. Its pre—computed models were publicly avail—
able (Alipanahi et al., 2015).

2.8 Structural source evaluation

To evaluate the effect of different RNA structure sources, we used
CLIP and icSHAPE data (Spitale et al., 2015). Probability vectors of
experimentally—measured RNA structure and CLIP—seq data were
downloaded from the GEO database (accession numbers GSE60034
and GSE6416 8, respectively). Binding site peaks were extracted as
in the original study (Spitale et al., 2015) using a 40nt window size.
We selected peaks that had measured structure both in vivo and
in vitro over all nucleotides, summing up to 4102 positive sequences.
As a control, we randomly selected 4102 40nt—long sequences that
had measured RNA structure. For computational structure predic—
tion, we ﬂanked binding sites and control sequences by 150nt on
each end, which were only used for structure prediction by
RNAplfold (Lorenz et al., 2011) and later discarded for the testing
(as done in (Maticzka et al., 2014)).

2.9 Model visualization

To visualize the model in an interpretable way, we collapsed it into
a PWM and structure parameters in the following way. For each
pair of k—mer and structure context (to, a), we calculated its score by:

M00417 (9) = a(bs + m) X «(hp + rm) (6)

We defined the (w, a) with the highest score as the consensus. To
derive a PWM, we used all k—mers at Hamming distance 1 from w,
and used their score in the structural context a as the weight in the
position of difference. For structure preferences, we used k—mer w
scores in different structural contexts as the weights. Sequence logos
were plotted using motifStack (Developer] and Developer L, 2015).

3 Results

3.1 RCK: a new algorithm to infer protein—RNA

binding preferences

We developed a new model for sequence and structure protein—
RNA binding preferences (Fig. 2A). The model is an extension of the
model used by the RNAcontext algorithm (Kazan et al., 2010),
which is based on a PWM and a vector of structure preferences. Our
new model is more complex, both in sequence and in structure.
Sequence—wise, each k—mer is assigned a unique sequence score.
Structure—wise, each k—mer, where the optimal value of k is typically
five for RNAcompete data (Supplementary Fig. S2), is assigned a
vector of structural preferences. See Section 2 for details and formal
definitions.

To demonstrate the improvement achieved by these model
changes, we ran RNAcontext on the original RNAcompete dataset
on which it was developed (Ray et al., 2009). This benchmark in—
cludes nine pairs of RNAcompete experiments. The sequences were
designed so that together they cover all 9—mers in unstructured re—
gions and all 7—mers in hairpin loops. We inferred a model from ex—
periment A and tested it on experiment B as in the original study
(Kazan et al., 2010). Performance was gauged by Pearson correl—
ation of predicted and measured intensities.

Results show that the new RCK model performs significantly
better than the old model. First, we demonstrate the benefit of using

Fig. 2. A new k—mer based model for protein—RNA binding (RCK). (A) The new k—mer model with k—mer specific sequence and structure preferences. Each k—mer
has a sequence score and a vector of structural preferences. In the old model, k—mers were assigned scores according to a position weight matrix and global
structural preferences. (B) The benefit of newly using sequence k—mer scores. For nine pairs of experiments, a model was trained on set A of the pair and tested
on set B using RNAcontext and different sequence and structure models. Pearson correlation was used to evaluate prediction accuracy. Average Person correl-

ation improved from 0.514 to 0.557. YB1 prefers to bind to several distinct k—mers, which are not modeled well by a single PWM. (C) The benefit of using k—mer
specific structural preferences (on top of k—mer sequence scores). Average Person correlation improved from 0.557 to 0.602. The same datasets were used as in
(B). In Fusip's model, the k—mer with the highest ratio of binding in unpaired compared to paired context is AGAGG, as was also observed by alignment of binding

sites (Kazan er al., 2010)

k—mer sequence scores (Fig. 2B). Pearson correlation is higher by
more than 0.01 for 5 out of the 9 proteins, and on average by 0.043
(P—value: 3.91 X 10‘3, Wilcoxon rank—sum test). The improvement
is particularly high for protein YB1. According to our results
(Fig. 2B), YB1 prefers to bind GU—rich k—mers on top of the known
literature motifs CAUC and CACC (Wei et al., 2012; Wu et al.,
2015 ). Secondly, we observe the benefit of having specific structure
preferences for each k—mer. The average Pearson correlation
increased by 0.045 as compared to the k—mer model with global
structure preferences (P—value: 1.95 X 10‘s), and by more than
0.01 in 5 out of the 9 proteins. For Fusip1, which regulates splicing,
the improvement is remarkable (0.17 in Pearson correlation). In the
original RNAcontext study, alignment of predicted binding sites re—
vealed that Fusip1 prefers to bind an unpaired region next to a
paired region (Fig. 2C). Notably, such a hybrid preference cannot be
modeled by global structure preferences, which assign the same
structural preference for all k—mers. For complete results, see
Supplementary Table S1.

3.2 RCK is much faster and memory—efficient

than the state of the art

We compared the running times and memory usage of the different
algorithms to infer sequence and structure protein—RNA binding
preferences: RCK, RNAcontext and GraphProt. For this task, we
ran each algorithm on RNAcompete experiment RNCMPT00001:

setA. We used default parameters and excluded the running time of
the parameter optimization (see Section 2 for details). In addition,
we excluded the running time of the structure prediction for two
reasons. First, it is negligible compared to the runtime of the algo—
rithm. RCK and RNAcontext use RNAplfold (Lorenz et al., 2011),
which takes less than 20 min on this sequence set. GraphProt uses
RNAshapes (Steffen et al., 2006), which takes less than 10min. In
addition, since each RNAcompete experiment is performed on the
same set of sequences, the structure prediction needs to be run only
once.

Results show that RCK is slightly faster than RNAcontext and
much faster than GraphProt in model training (Supplementary Fig.
S1). For a complete run on RNCMPT00001:setA, RCK and
RNAcontext terminated in less than 2 h (101 and 107 min, respect—
ively), while GraphProt required more than 7 days (10 660 min).
Despite the fact that RCK trains a model that is exponentially greater
in size than RNAcontext’s model, it is slightly faster thanks to our im—
proved implementation of the L—BFGS optimization. In our imple—
mentation, the change in the parameters is calculated by one pass
over the data, as opposed to the original implementation where a pass
was made for each parameter. This reduces each iteration’s runtime
to be linear in the size of the input, instead of the size of the input
times the size of the model, as done in the original implementation.
RCK and RNAcontext are much faster than GraphProt, which is
based on support vector regression to learn the binding models.

In terms of memory usage, RCK is more efficient than both
RNAcontext and GraphProt (Supplementary Fig. S1). The memory
demand of GraphProt on RNCMPT00001zsetA is more than 12GB,
while RCK and RNAcontext require 700 MB and 2 GB, respect—
ively. RCK is more efficient than RNAcontext thanks to our im—
proved implementation that allocates less memory for data and
parameters, despite the increased model size.

3.3 RCK is more accurate in in vitro binding prediction
than the state of the art

To gauge the performance of RCK compared to extant methods, we
used the comprehensive dataset of RNAcompete, which includes
244 experiments (Ray et al., 2013). We clamped outlier intensities
of each experiment as described in the Deepbind study (Alipanahi
et al., 2015 ), and trained a model on set A sequences. Performance
was gauged by Pearson correlation of predicted and measured set B
probe intensities. For sequence—based methods, we used the results
published in the Deepbind study, comparing algorithms Ray et al.
(Ray et al., 2013), MatrixREDUCE (Foat et al., 2006) and
Deepbind (Alipanahi et al., 2015). We added to the comparison the
results of RNAcontext. We did not include GraphProt in the com—
parison as, in addition to its inability to infer structural preference

from RNAcompete data due to the unstructured nature of the data
(Maticzka et al., 2014), it is memory— and time—intensive; it requires
more than 7 days and 12GB of memory to run on Set A of one
RNAcompete experiment. For complete details, see Section 2.

RCK significantly outperformed all methods in in vitro binding
prediction (Fig. 3A). When comparing RCK to sequence—based
methods, it outperformed the state—of—the—art Deepbind, which
achieved an average AUC of 0.409 as compared to 0.460 for RCK
(P—value: 3.67 X 10‘“, Wilcoxon rank—sum test) (Fig. 3B). RCK
outperformed the structure—based method RNAcontext as well (Fig.
3C), which achieved an average AUC of 0.433 (P—value:
2.36 X 10‘”). Notably, RNAcontext did not perform significantly
better than Deepbind (P—value:0.093). For complete results, see
Supplementary Table S2.

3.4 RCK is as accurate at in vivo binding prediction as
the state of the art

To gauge the performance of RCK compared to extant methods on
in vivo binding prediction, we used the dataset curated as part of the
GraphProt study (Maticzka et al., 2014). The dataset includes 24
CLIP experiments, each containing thousands of experimentally
validated in vivo binding sites and control sequences extracted from

RNAcompete-derived methods predicting in vitro binding

unbound regions of the same transcripts. Each binding site and control
sequence is ﬂanked by adjacent 150nt, both downstream and up—
stream, to allow for accurate structure prediction (using RNAplfold
(Lorenz et al., 2011)). The overlap with RNAcompete’s dataset covers
10 proteins from 21 RNAcompete and 12 CLIP experiments (Ray
et al., 2013). We could not use the curated in vivo dataset of the
RNAcompete study (Ray et al., 201 3), as the sequences in it did not in—
clude ﬂanks, and thus structure prediction would be inaccurate. For
the sequence—based method, we used the state—of—the—art Deepbind
(Alipanahi et al., 2015), and for structure—based, RNAcontext. We
trained RCK and RNAcontext models on a complete set of sequences
of each RNAcompete experiment. Deepbind models were publicly
available. We reported the performance in predicting in vivo binding
by average AUC over the pairs of RNAcompete and CLIP experiments
for each protein. See Section 2 for details.

Results show that the performance of all methods is comparable.
On 10 proteins, no method outperforms the other two on the major—
ity of proteins (Fig. 4A). RCK performs the best (albeit not signifi—
cantly), achieving a median AUC of 0.803, compared to 0.791 and
0.778 for Deepbind and RNAcontext, respectively (Fig. 4B). In a
pairwise comparison between RCK, Deepbind and RNAcontext, no
method is significantly better (P—values >0.279, Wilcoxon rank—sum
test). Two reasons may hamper the accuracy of in vitro models in
predicting in vivo binding. First, in vivo data is known to be noisy
and suffer from experimental biases (Fu and Ares Jr, 2014; Kishore
et al., 2011). Moreover, RNA structure prediction is less accurate
in vivo than in vitro (Rouskin et al., 2014). At this stage, more data—
sets with higher quality are needed in the overlap between CLIP and
RNAcompete to derive more definitive conclusions. For complete
results, see Supplementary Table S3.

3.5 RCK can easily be applied to experimentally
measured RNA structure probabilities

One of the benefits of RCK is its ability to incorporate experimen—
tally measured RNA structure probabilities. RCK receives as input
probability vectors of different structural contexts of the input se—
quences in single nucleotide resolution. These can be either

A100 Predictng in vivo binding per protein

 

computationally predicted (e.g. by RNAplfold (Lorenz et al., 2011))
or experimentally measured (e.g. by icSHAPE (Spitale et al., 2015)).
To demonstrate the effect of using experimental probabilities, we
used available CLIP and icSHAPE experiments, performed on the
same cells that also had an RNAcompete experiment on the same
protein (see Section 2 for details). Unfortunately, only the HuR pro—
tein, which had five RNAcompete experiments, was found to over—
lap. We compared the effect of five different structural sources:
in vivo icSHAPE, in vitro icSHAPE, in silico (RNAplfold), no proba—
bilities (sequence scores only) and uniform probabilities. Since
icSHAPE reports only unpaired probabilities, we trained a model
based on two structural contexts: paired and unpaired. Performance
was measured by AUC in predicting HuR binding sites.

Results show that RCK can benefit from experimentally meas—
ured RNA structure in predicting in vivo binding (Fig. 5). icSHAPE
in vivo measurements are more accurate than in vitro measurement
in four out of five experiments, and more accurate than predicted
structure in four out of five experiments. When using uniform struc—
ture probabilities or sequence scores alone, performance decreased
substantially. This can likely be explained by HuR’s strong prefer—
ence to bind unpaired regions (Li et al., 2010), which was automat—
ically encoded into RCK’s models. We note that additional
experimental measurements of RNA structure and protein—RNA
binding on the same cells are needed to evaluate the benefit of ex—
perimentally measured RNA structure for the task of in vivo binding
prediction. For complete results, see Supplementary Table S4.

4 Discussion

In this study, we developed RCK, a new algorithm to infer complex
models of protein—RNA binding. RCK uses a k—mer based model for
sequence preferences and specific structural context preferences for
each k—mer based on probability profiles. We demonstrated the ac—
curacy of our algorithm on the most comprehensive set of in vitro
data, where its inferred models were significantly more accurate in
predicting in vitro binding than the state—of—the—art. Moreover, we
showed that RCK is capable of incorporating either predicted or

Fig. 5. Structural sources effect on RCK in vivo binding prediction. HuR binding model was learned from different RNAcompete experiments. As an example, the

sequence and structural preferences learned from RNCMPT00032 are shown (left upper and middle, respectively), as well as the sequence logo and structural

context from (Kazan er al., 2010). RCK models were used to predict in vivo binding based on structural probabilities derived from different sources (right): in vivo
(icSHAPE (Spitale er al., 2015)), in vitro (icSHAPE), in silico (RNAplfold (Lorenz er al., 2011)), no probabilities (sequence scores only) and uniform probabilities.

Performance of HuR binding prediction was gauged by AUC

experimentally measured RNA structure probabilities to improve
in vivo binding prediction. Unfortunately, in vivo datasets that over—
lap RNAcompete are too few to reach definitive conclusions regard—
ing performance.

The success of our more complex model shows that protein—
RNA binding is better modeled using a more complex k—mer based
model. The position—independence assumption that is inherent in the
position weight matrix has been challenged for a long time (Eggeling
et al., 2014, 2015). To make no assumptions, we used a list of all
possible k—mers and a score for each one. For structure preferences,
individual k—mers may have different structure preferences; global
preferences common to all k—mers may be too limiting. By incorpo—
rating unique preferences for each k—mer, we allow k—mers to have
unique structural preferences.

The k—mer model is the most comprehensive binding model, but it
also has its disadvantages. The number of parameters increases signifi—
cantly compared to simple models, increasing the risk of over—fitting
the training data. For example, the original model included 4k se—
quence parameters (where k is the width of the model) and 2A struc—
ture parameters (where 2.1 is the number of structural contexts). The
k—mer model has 4la sequence parameters, and 4la X 24 structure par—
ameters. When comparing different [2 values, 3 S k S 7 (see
Supplementary Fig. S2), we observed a decrease in performance for
k 2 6, which we explain by over—fitting to the training set. For ex—
ample, when k : 7 and 2A : 5 the model contains 98 298 parameters
(see below), while the training set has only around 120 000 samples.
To avoid over—fitting, we used a 2—fold cross—validation on the training
set to find the optimal width in the range 4 S k S 6. Another disad—
vantage of the k—mer model lies in its visualization. As the model is
more complex, it is more difficult to visualize the complete landscape
of sequence and structure preferences in an interpretable manner.

On the implementation side, we were able to extend
RNAcontext and make it more efficient both for running time and
memory usage. In our improved implementation, each iteration of
the optimization procedure is linear in the size of the input and num—
ber of parameters, as compared to the size of the input times the
number of parameters in the original implementation (which would
have been very costly with our expanded model of 4la X (24 + 1)
parameters). Moreover, L—BFGS, the optimization procedure used in

RCK, runs in time O(N + D), where D is the size of the input and N
the number of parameters (Liu and Nocedal, 1989). SVR, used by
GraphProt, requires C(DZN) time (Burges, 1998), which is infeas—
ible for large datasets, as in RNAcompete.

We see several potential extensions to this work given the new
model and inferred sequence and structure preferences. First, as we
expanded the model to the k—mer model, we limited it to relatively
small k’s (k S 6) due to the size of the datasets. It may be worth—
while to utilize machine learning algorithms with stricter regulariza—
tion terms that infer sparse models, such as Lasso (Tibshirani, 2011).
In this way, [2 may be increased without jeopardizing the accuracy of
the models. Second, the current model assumes a single structural
context for the whole k—mer. Structural preferences may be position—
specific in single—nucleotide resolution. Expanding the model to
position—specific structure preferences may be possible by either using
a simpler sequence model (e.g. PWM) or learning a sparse model (as
mentioned above), as imposing such an extension on the k—mer
model increases the number of parameters by a factor of k, the width
of the model. Third, the application of in vitro protein—RNA binding
models to predict in vivo data is still lacking. We believe that by using
experimentally measured RNA structures we can improve in vivo
binding prediction, as we demonstrated here on a small scale. In this
aspect, more CLIP and experimentally measured RNA structure
datasets are needed as well as improvements in their quality.

To summarize, we developed RCK, a new algorithm to infer pro—
tein—RNA binding preferences. RCK is highly accurate at predicting
in vitro binding. By applying it to the RNAcompete dataset, we
were able to newly uncover the structural preferences of more than
200 proteins, which we make available as a resource on the RCK
website. We hope that the new algorithm and its inferred models
will provide a rich platform and resource for future studies to better
understand the binding mechanism underlying and regulatory roles
of protein—RNA binding.

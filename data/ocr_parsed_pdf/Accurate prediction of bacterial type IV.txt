ABSTRACT

Motivation: Various human pathogens secret effector proteins into
hosts cells via the type IV secretion system (T488). These proteins
play important roles in the interaction between bacteria and hosts.
Computational methods for T4SS effector prediction have been de-
veloped for screening experimental targets in several isolated bacterial
species; however, widely applicable prediction approaches are still
unavailable

Results: In this work, four types of distinctive features, namely, amino
acid composition, dipeptide composition, .position-specific scoring
matrix composition and auto covariance transformation of position-
specific scoring matrix, were calculated from primary sequences. A
classiﬁer, T4EffPred, was developed using the support vector machine
with these features and their different combinations for effector pre-
diction. Various theoretical tests were performed in a newly estab-
lished dataset, and the results were measured with four indexes. We
demonstrated that T4EffPred can discriminate IVA and NB effectors in
benchmark datasets with positive rates of 76.7% and 89.7%, respect-
ively. The overall accuracy of 95.9% shows that the present method is
accurate for distinguishing the T488 effector in unidentified se-
quences. A classifier ensemble was designed to synthesize all single
classiﬁers. Notable performance improvement was observed using
this ensemble system in benchmark tests. To demonstrate the
model’s application, a genome-scale prediction of effectors was per-
formed in Bartonella hense/ae, an important zoonotic pathogen.
A number of putative candidates were distinguished.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bacterial pathogens translocate numerous effector proteins into
the extracellular environment of host cells Via secretion systems.
These proteins play critical roles in Virulence and survival. In
gram-negative bacteria, secretion systems are classiﬁed into
seven major evolutionarily and functionally related subclasses,

termed types IiVII (Tseng et al., 2009). In recent years, type
III and type IV secretion systems (T388 and T4SS), which
allow injection of effectors directly into the host cell cytoplasm,
have been widely studied (Cambronne and Roy, 2006; Galan and
Wolf-Watz, 2006; Llosa et al., 2009). T4SS consists of transmem-
brane multi-protein complexes and exists in many zoonotic
pathogens, such as Brucella sp., Bartonella henselae, Coxiella
burnetii, as well as in some other gram-negative pathogens,
such as Bordetella pertussis, Helicobacter pylori and
L.pneum0phila (Chandran et al., 2009; Fronzes et al., 2009).
Many T4SS effectors, including two main subtypes called IVA
and IVB, have been confirmed to be involved in the pathogen-
icity of these species (Llosa et al., 2009). To adapt to different
hosts and different survival strategies, the arsenal of known
effectors varies widely across bacterial species and even shows
distinct differences between bacterial strains.

Recently, a number of novel T4SS effectors have been identi-
ﬁed by experimental approaches such as fusion protein report
assays (Burstein et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Lockwood et al.,
2011; Marchesini et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011). In many of these
studies, previously developed bioinformatics screening strategies
were adopted to predict effector candidates in genomic proteins
before experimental translocation verification. Sequence hom-
ology to known effectors and conserved domain analysis were
used to detect putative effectors in the genome of Brucella abor-
tus (Marchesini et al., 2011). An omnibus method, synthesizing
hydropathy profile comparison, eukaryotic domain search,
signal peptide identification and sequence similarity alignment,
was built to scan genomic sequences of Anaplasma marginale
for potential T4SS effectors (Lockwood et al., 2011). Two
approaches based on feature extraction and machine learning
algorithms were developed for large-scale effector identiﬁcation
in L.pneum0phila (Burstein et al., 2009) and C.bumetii (Chen
et al., 2010), respectively. A hidden semi-Markov model
(HSMM) was constructed to describe C-terminal patterns and
predict type-IVB secretion signals with high accuracy (Lifshitz
et al., 2013). Established methods for detecting the regulatory
elements or C-terminal translocation signals of eukaryotic pro-
teins were applied before screening of the experimental targets,
resulting in most of the T488 effectors being identiﬁed in
L.pneum0phila (Segal, 2013; Zhu et al., 2011).

The computational ﬁlters in these existing methods success-
fully selected a small portion of the genomic proteins as candi-
dates for experimental identiﬁcation. However, these methods

are not exhaustive enough and are not generally applicable for
secretion signal detection, especially for modelling type-IVA
signal. Homology search based on sequence alignment can
only ﬁnd candidates that are similar to known effectors.
Scanning of regulatory elements or C-terminal signals relies on
the known motifs in the sequences of effectors and their pro-
moters, which are conserved but speciﬁc to effector families.
Furthermore, all existing machine learning models are based on
sequence features from a small supply of known effectors from
particular bacterial species. Therefore, they are often not accurate
for genomic effector discovery in other bacterial species. There are
<300 experimentally validated effectors in the 1884 known ef-
fectors stored in the SecReT4 database (Bi et al., 2013).
Although several methods have reported excellent performance
in identifying T3SS effectors in a wide variety of bacterial genomes
(Arnold et al., 2009; Sato et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Yang
et al., 2010), they are not recommended for T4SS effector predic-
tion due to low accuracies. Accurate prediction approaches that
are widely applicable to mining putative type-IVA or type-IVB
effectors in gram-negative pathogens are still absent.

Several computational approaches based on existing machine
learning algorithms, e.g. Naive Bayes, hidden Markov models,
artiﬁcial neural network and support vector machine (SVM),
have successfully predicted T3SS secreted signals (Arnold et al.,
2009; Lower and Schneider 2009; Samudrala et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2010). However, the accuracy of machine
learning approach depends on the quantities of authentic nega-
tive and positive samples. Studies identifying T3SS effectors are
abundant, but those identifying T4SS effectors are rare. The two
recently published databases, AtlasT4SS (Souza et al., 2012) and
SecRet4 (Bi et al., 2013), have announced freely available data-
sets for T4SS components and secreted proteins. These datasets
provide numerous samples to train and optimize machine learn-
ing models for T4SS effectors prediction.

In this article, we propose a SVM model using four types of
features calculated from residue composition and position-spe-
ciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM) proﬁles. The machine learning-based
model is trained on a set of experimentally validated T4SS ef-
fectors and 1132 non-effectors and is used to provide accurate
predictions of T4SS secreted proteins in evolutionarily distinct
bacteria. We demonstrate that our model can discriminate be-
tween IVA effectors (or IVB effectors) and non-effectors, with an
accuracy of 93.3% (or 95.9%), Via leave-one-tests. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first method to predict IVA effectors in
gram-negative bacteria. Genomic-scale prediction of effectors in
the zoonotic pathogen B.henselae is also performed and dis-
cussed. A list of predicted candidates from B.henselae may be
of academic interest in studying human pathogenic bacteria.

2 METHODS
2.1 Dataset

We constructed a dataset of known effectors and a dataset of non-
effectors. To collect known effectors, all experimentally validated effector
sequences were extracted from the effector dataset in the SecRet4 data-
base. In addition, other T4SS effectors conﬁrmed by experiments were
collected from other studies. Four hundred and twenty six effectors
(51 IVA sequences and 375 IVB sequences) comprised the initial effector
dataset. Because a dataset of experimentally validated non-effectors was

unavailable, we searched for genes from 10 T4SS pathogens that are also
present as homologous genes in the Escherichia coli genome. These patho-
gens, including Agrobacterium sp., Amarginale, B.henselae, Bpertussis,
Brucella melitensis, C .bumetii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, H .pylori,
L.pneumophila and Ochrobactrum anthropic, secrete a majority of the
currently known T4SS effectors. The genes that exist in these organisms
and in E.coli are most likely not associated with pathogenicity and are
thus expected to be non-effectors. To document these genes, the genomic
proteins from the 10 pathogens were compared against Ecoli proteins
using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Each pathogen pro-
tein with an E-value< 1e-20 and sequence similarity with E.coli> 50%
was extracted. The 1000 non-effector proteins collected by Lifshitz et a].
(Lifshitz et al., 2013) and a number of proteins in UniProt that have been
annotated and reviewed as non-secreted proteins were also appended in
the non-effector list. Additionally, all experimentally validated T4SS com-
ponent proteins derived from the SecRet4 database were included in the
non-effector dataset. Furthermore, 471 proteins from the 10 pathogens
with unique experimentally validated subcellular localization in
ePSORTb (intracellular and extracellular with deﬁnite functions) (Rey
et al., 2005) were also ﬁltered out and added to the complete non-effector
list containing 5649 sequences.

To ﬁlter out orthologous and paralogous proteins, two steps were
performed successively. First, all sequences in each dataset were clustered
using BLAST, with the parameters of 20% sequence identity and 80%
coverage. Only one seed sequence in each cluster remained for the next
step. Second, an all-against-all comparison of full-length sequences using
the SmithiWaterman algorithm was performed. The Water program in
the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) pack-
age was used to implement this pairwise alignment process. For each pair,
the ratio between the pairwise score, Spam and the self-alignment score,
SSE", was computed, and sequences were iteratively grouped if they
showed a Spar/SSE” value 30.15. This measure has excellent sensitivity
and is similar to the measure used by Arnold et a]. (Arnold et al.,
2009) for the detection of putative orthologs in TSSS effector sequences.
After these steps, 340 effectors (30 IVA proteins and 310 IVB proteins)
and 1132 non-effectors were retained in the ﬁnal datasets, which are col-
lectively referred to as T4_1472 in this study.

2.2 Composition of amino acids and amino acid pairs

For protein sequence A, we used a 20-D vector {f1, f2, . . . , fzo} and a
400-D vector {d1, d2, . . . , d400} to represent the composition of 20
amino acids and 400 amino acid pairs, respectively. The 20 elements in
{f1,f2, . . . , fzo} represent the number of amino acids normalized with the
total number of residues of A. The 400 elements in {d1, d2,..., d400}
represent the number of 400 amino acid pairs normalized with the total
number of residue pairs of A.

2.3 PSSM proﬁles and auto covariance transformation

The PSSM of a protein contains the protein’s amino acid substitution
scores. Hence, we adopted PSSM proﬁles, which were used for subcellu-
lar localization prediction (Xie et al., 2005) and protein structural classi-
ﬁcation (Chen et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2010) to calculate the evolutionary
features of T4SS secreted proteins. In this study, the PSSM proﬁle of each
protein was generated by running Position-Speciﬁc Iterative Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST) against the NCBI’s non-redundant
(nr) protein database (version 2012.12.01) with the parameters h: 0.001
and j: 3. The nr database is freely downloadable at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.
gov/. The (i, J)th entry of the resulting matrix represents integral score of
the amino acid in the ith position of the query sequence mutated to amino
acid type j during the evolution process. Two features, namely, PSSM
composition and auto covariance transformation, were extracted from
the PSSM proﬁles. The PSSM composition was generated by summing
the amino acid rows in the PSSM. The details of how to generate 400

composition features from the original PSSM proﬁles are shown in
Supplementary Figure S1. Because each residue has many physicochem-
ical properties, such as polarity, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity, se-
quence proﬁles and so on, a protein sequence can be represented as a
numeric matrix. Auto covariance transformation can measure the correl-
ation of two properties (or the same property) along the protein sequence
and transform the matrix into a ﬁxed-length vector (Dong et al., 2009).
For the auto covariance transformation, let us denote the PSSM of a
protein sequence as:

PSSM=(51,S2, “3520) (1)
where S, (i = 1, 2, . . . , 20) is the column vector of amino acid type i in the
matrix. We also denote each column vector as:

Sj = (S1,j,S2,j,, “‘aSL,j)T(j =1,2,“‘,20) (2)

where L is the length of the protein sequence and silf denotes the score of
number j residue in position i corresponding to the sequence order. The
function of auto covariance transformation is deﬁned as the following:

1 Leg 1 L 1 L
PSSM,AC- =— .,--—— .,-- .,- -—— .,-- 3

J,g L_g;(",1 Lgs'gxhrgy 14;",1) ()
(j=1,2,...,20,g=1,2,...,G). Hence, auto covariance transformation

of PSSM (PSSM_AC) has 20*G features, where G is a positive integer
that indicates the grouped number of the transformation.

In this study, PSSM_AC transforms the PSSM proﬁle of a sequence
into a vector by calculating the correlation of its properties (i.e. evolu-
tionary conservation of 20 residues in each position) between two residues
separated by a distance of G along the sequence.

2.4 SVM classiﬁer

SVM is a machine learning algorithm that has been widely used for clas-
siﬁcation purposes. It is described in many other publications; therefore, it
will not be discussed in detail in this article. We used the publicly available
software the Library for Support Vector Machines (LIBSVM) for the
implementation of our SVM classiﬁer. The LIBSVM toolbox can be
freely downloaded at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm. We inte-
grated this toolbox in the Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) workspace to
build the prediction system. Here, the radial basis function was chosen as
the kernel function and the SVM parameter y and penalty parameter C
optimized using a grid search based on a lO-fold cross-validation.

2.5 Protein sequence representation

We used four types of feature vectors to represent a protein sequence
[amino acid composition (AAC), residue pair composition (dipeptide
composition, DPC), PSSM proﬁle composition (PSSM) and
PSSM_AC]. In addition, the AAC vector and the DPC vector were
combined with the PSSM vector and the PSSM_AC vector, respectively,
to obtain ﬁxed-length vectors. We examined the SVMs based on different
vectors to assess prediction performance in T4_1472. A diagram that
describes the computational steps of this study is shown in
Supplementary Figure S2.

2.6 Performance assessment
The prediction performance in T4_1472 was assessed by four measures:
Acc, Sn, Sp and Matthew’s correlation coefﬁcient (MCC) (Matthews,
1975). These measures are deﬁned as follows:

TP + TN

A66 2 — (4)
TP + TN + FP + FN
TP
5" =m (5)
TN
= — 6
Sp TN+ FP ( )

_ TP x TN— FP x FN
_ \/(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)

 

M CC (7)

 

where TP, FP, TN and FN refer to the number of true positives, false
positives, true negatives and false negatives, respectively. A MCC coefﬁ-
cient of one represents a perfect prediction, whereas zero indicates a
completely random assignment. A00 is the overall accuracy in discrimi-
nating between effectors and non-effector proteins. Sn and Sp are the
sensitivity and the speciﬁcity values, which measure the ability to cor-
rectly predict effectors and correctly reject non-effectors. We also used the
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve to measure the present
model’s true-positive rate and low false-positive rate during the predic-
tion. Furthermore, the ROC curve can be quantified by the area under
the curve (AUC), which is usually more accurate in evaluating learning
algorithms.

3 RESULTS

3.1 ACC 0f effectors and non-effectors

We computed the ACC and the variance in T4_1472 (Fig. 1). We
noticed that the residues Ala, Asn, Glu, Gly, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe,
Ser and Val had variances >1. In these residues, Asn, Glu and
Lys had higher compositions in IVB effectors. In contrast, Ala,
Gly and Val had higher composition in non-effectors. Somewhat
differently, Ala, Glu and Ser occurred more frequently in IVA
effectors than in non-effectors but Ile, Leu and Phe did not.
Some polar amino acids, such as Asp, Cys and His, have small
differences between secreted proteins and non-secreted proteins.
The detailed data are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

We also calculated the dipeptide composition and the variance
for all 400 possible residue pairs in T4_1472. Those pairs with the
topmost variances are listed in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.
The pairs SS, LL and AA showed variances >0.3 between IVA
proteins and non-effectors; however, the pairs KE, AA and AG
had variances >0.3 between IVB proteins and the non-effectors.
Most of the residue pairs with Ala had higher variances than the
others. In contrast, some pairs with Cys, His and Tyr, such as

effectors and non-effectors (data not shown).

3.2 The effect of G for auto covariance transformation

As mentioned in Section 2.3, the theoretical maximum number of
G is the length of the shortest sequence in the dataset. G deﬁnes
the maximum distance between two positions in the target se-
quence. The optimal value of G varies for different datasets. By
setting G from 1 to 20, 20 PSSM_AC vectors with different
lengths were calculated for protein representation. We examined
the performance of IVB effector discrimination using SVMs with
these features in T4_1472 by 5-fold cross-validation tests. The
variability curve of the prediction rate is shown in Figure 2. The
curve ﬁrst ascends continuously to a maximum value and then
drops slightly with the increase in G. The best accuracy of 93.0%
was achieved with G: 10 (see Supplementary Table S4 for de-
tails). We also tested the prediction accuracy of PSSM_AC vec-
tors with G>20 and found that these vectors did not lead to
performance improvement. The trend of the performance curve
of G for IVA effector prediction was in accordance with the
above case (data not shown).The best value for G in T4_1472
was 10, which generated a 200—D vector in the PSSM
transformation.

3.3 Prediction performance in datasets

Owing to the imbalance between positive samples and negative
samples in T4_1472, leave-one-out (LOO) tests were conducted
for performance assessment, using radial basis function kernel
SVM classiﬁers with different features as well as their combin-
ations as inputs. We used four single feature vectors and five
combination vectors for IVA effector discrimination and IVB
effector discrimination. The nine feature vectors and their cor-
responding results are shown in Table 1. In line with single fea-
ture tests, we observed that the performance measures of the four
feature categories were different. The classiﬁer using the PSSM
composition discriminated IVB effectors and non-effectors with

the highest sensitivity (89.4%), which was 6.5% higher than
PSSM_AC and 20% higher than the ACC. The PSSM vector
is also better than other single vectors for IVA effector predic-
tion. It produced 73.3% sensitivity and 93.3% accuracy with the
highest MCC value of 0.782. The capability of two PSSM feature
categories, i.e. PSSM and PSSM_AC, is stronger than AAC and
DPC. The combined feature tests in Table 1 show that the per-
formance was improved when AAC was combined with PSSM.
For IVB effector prediction, the accuracy of AAC improved
from 88.7% to 95.9% when it was combined with PSSM. For
IVA effector prediction, the highest accuracy of 93.3% and an
MCC of 0.784 were achieved by using AAC plus PSSM. We
noticed that DPC had the lowest accuracy of all single vectors.
DPC predictions did not improve when combined with other
features. The sensitivity of these features for IVA effector pre-
diction was generally lower than for IVB effector prediction, but
the specificity was higher. This was likely because of a much
smaller number of IVA sequences than IVB sequences in
T4_1472.

We also executed independent dataset tests to assess the per-
formance of our model for IVA and IVB effector prediction. In
these tests, a small portion of positive sequences and negative
sequences in T4_1472 was picked up for prediction and others
for training. The corresponding results are illustrated in
Supplementary Table S5. Supplementary Table S5 shows a simi-
lar performance proﬁle to Table 1. For IVB effector prediction,
the PSSM vector in combination with AAC outperformed other
single vectors and combined vectors. Not surprisingly, the sensi-
tivity of all feature vectors was decreased for IVA effector pre-
diction because of fewer positive training samples and weaker
C—terminal signals (Supplementary Fig. S3). PSSM and
PSSM_AC were more effective for IVA effector discrimination
than other features when they were used alone or in combination
with AAC.

The ROC curves in Figure 3 illustrate the performance trends
for discriminating IVB effectors and non-effectors using our clas-
siﬁcation models in 5-fold cross-validation tests. Figure 3a shows
that four single feature vectors (i.e. AAC, DPC, PSSM and
PSSM_AC) produce different ROCs in 5-fold cross-validation
tests. Figure 3b shows ROCs produced by SVMs with four com-
bined vectors. In Figure 3a, the AUC is 0.970, 0.926, 0.904 and
0.892 for PSSM, PSSM_AC, AAC and DPC, respectively.
Furthermore, AUCs of 0.970, 0.950 and 0.972 were obtained
using four vector combinations [i.e. PSSM plus AAC,
PSSM_AC plus AAC, PSSM plus PSSM_AC and AAC plus
DPC (see Supplementary Table S6)]. Further analysis indicated
that the true-positive rate of PSSM exceeded 85% when the
false-positive rate was <3%. Moreover, PSSM plus AAC and
PSSM plus PSSM_AC both distinguished IVB effectors with a
true-positive rate of over 90% and with a false-positive rate
under 4% at the same time.

3.4 Prediction performance of the classiﬁer ensemble

We observed that PSSM was the most effective single feature
vector for effector prediction. No signiﬁcant performance im-
provement was obtained through its combinations with other
predictors (shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3). On the other hand,
the abilities of the four single vectors to predict T4SS effectors

Figure 4. We used two voting schemes, 2-in-3 and 3-in-4, to syn-
thesize SVMs outputs and give the final estimate. The 2-in-3
voting system was used for two or more positive predictions in
every three classiﬁers. Likewise the 3-in-4 voting system was used
for three or more positive outputs in all four classiﬁers. We exam-
ined the ensemble system Via 10-fold cross-validation for IVB ef-
fector discrimination in T4_1472. Table 2 shows that the
performance of the classiﬁer ensemble is better than independent
classiﬁers. The highest sensitivity and the accuracy of 91.6% and
97.9%, respectively, were obtained using the 2-in-3 voting system
based on the three SVM predictors (AAC, PSSM and PSSM_AC)
that outperformed the single classiﬁers in Table 1 and Table 2.

The characteristics of the classiﬁer ensemble for IVA effector
prediction were also detected by LOO tests in T4_1472
(Supplementary Table S7). In the LOO tests, the ensemble of
SVM_AAC, SVM_PSSM and SVM_PSSM_AC surpassed all
single classiﬁers. While discriminating negative sequences with
100% accuracy rate, this classiﬁer correctly predicted 76.7% of
IVA effectors.

3.5 Comparison with existing methods

Two research groups reported the ability to implement genomic-
scale prediction of T4SS effectors in L.pneum0phila (Burstein
et al., 2009; Lifshitz et al., 2013), predicting experimentally iden-
tifying dozens of secreted signals. The method presented by
Burstein et al. used multiple sequence features and used a machine
learning-based classiﬁer ensemble to distinguish effectors from the
genomic proteins. This method was also adopted by Chen et al. to
predict effectors in the genome of C .burnetii. In a dataset of 134
known effectors and 670 non-effectors, this method achieved an
accuracy of 95.9% with an AUC of 0.980. Another method de-
veloped by Lifshitza et al. used the HSMM to construct a C-ter-
minal proﬁle of known effectors and to search those proteins for
significant signals. It correctly predicted 92.9% effectors of 283
known effectors against a background of 1000 non-effectors with

an AUC of 0.881. Based on these datasets, we performed LOO
tests to measure the prediction rate of our model (Supplementary
Table S8). Compared with Burstein et al.’s ensemble predictor,
our ensemble model had higher accuracy and a higher value for
the AUC, although other single models resulted in lower AUCs.
In the dataset from Lifshitz et al., HSMM had a higher sensitivity
than all other single models; however, our ensemble predictor
produced better performance measures in the LOO tests.

3.6 Genome-scale prediction in B.henselae

To assess the ability of our prediction system to discriminate
T4SS effectors from genomic proteins, we used several independ-
ent classiﬁers and a classiﬁer ensemble to predict effectors in
1488 genomic proteins from B.henselae strain Houston-1.
B.henselae is the major human pathogen in the genus
Bartonella, which causes cat-scratch disease. VirB/VirD4 T4SS
has been identiﬁed in this pathogen and was veriﬁed to be essen-
tial for establishing intraerythrocytic infection. This T4SS secrets
dozens of effectors into host cells, and three of them have been
included in T4_1472. The majority of these effectors belong to
the Bep family. Sequence alignments showed that all these ef-
fectors had high homology with seven proteins from B.henselae
(BH13370, BHl3390, BHl3400, BH13410, BHl3420, BHl3430
and BH13440). We trained our model using T4_1472 without
three known effectors (BH13370, BH13410 and BH13440) and
then predicted effector candidates from 1488 genomic proteins
(Supplementary Table S9). Using IVA sequences for training,
417102 proteins were predicted as effectors, and at least three
of the seven known effectors were correctly recognized. The
AAC predictor and the PSSM predictor had better recognition
rates to known effectors than others. Using IVB sequences for
training, 1177158 candidates were predicted by these models. We
noticed that fewer of the known effectors were discovered by the
PSSM predictor and the PSSM_AC predictor, which are more
sensitive to training data than other models. Although gaps in
ACC and dipeptide composition exist between IVA effectors and
IVB effectors, both the AAC model and the DPC model

recognized more known effectors when using IVB data rather
than IVA data for training. Models trained using all samples in
the T4_1472 were then used to predict effectors. All seven known
effectors were detected by the AAC model, and six were detected
by the PSSM model. The number of inferred effectors decreased
when classiﬁer ensembles were used for prediction, but at least
six of the known effectors were present in each candidate list.
Fifty-seven proteins were detected by the ensemble with the
3-in-4 voting scheme, in which seven were known effectors and
50 were putative secreted proteins (see Supplementary Table
S10). Of these putative effectors, three were annotated as tonB
(BH04980), filamentous hemagglutinin (BH07950) and kroA
(BH15560) in UniProt. The others were uncharacterized pro-
teins. BH04980 was inferred as a cell surface protein for potential
transporter activity. BH07950 is a putative surface protein, but
its function is not clear. BH15560 has a high homology with the
korA protein from Bartonella grahamii, which is characterized as
a regulatory gene for trw T4SS (Nystedt et al., 2008). C—terminus
sequence profiles (Supplementary Fig. S3) show that the prob-
ability of amino acid occurrence in IVA effectors or IVB
effectors is different from non-effectors. The proﬁles of the 50
inferred effectors show weak C-terminal patterns, possibly be-
cause many sequences do not carry signiﬁcant signals in the
C—terminus, which is expected for IVA effectors. The homolo-
gous targets of the 50 putative effectors were examined in the
NCBI protein database using BLAST (E-Value< 1e-10)
(Supplementary Table S10). The majority of homologous pro-
teins (39 of 50, including 25 conserved homologs and 14 self-
homologs) were uncharacterized proteins and four were putative
membrane proteins. Three homologs (heme exporter, slyX and
tonB) are known to share an evolutionary lineage with T4SS
proteins in Bartonella (Engel et al., 2011). In summary, these
candidates may provide potential targets for functional identiﬁ-
cation of T4SS pathogenicity.

4 DISCUSSION

The prediction of effectors in bacterial genomes is an important
task for functional analysis of the T4SS of human pathogens.

Accurate prediction of bacterial type IV secreted effectors

 

Previous studies demonstrated that T4SS effectors in several
bacterial species contained conserved C-terminal signals and eu-
karyotic domains (McDermott et al., 2011; Segal 2013).
Differences in GC content between the effector genes and the
non-effector genes were also discovered (Burstein et al., 2009).
Xu et al. reported a hidden Markov model-based method to
evaluate the distribution pattern of EPIYA motifs in a broad
range of biological species to predict potential T3SS effectors,
but this motif was not widely distributed from T4SS secreted
proteins 0(u et al., 2010). Burstein et al. presented a machine
learning method based on known features to predict candidates
for genome-wide effector identiﬁcation in L.pneum0phila
(Burstein et al., 2009). This approach was effective for screening
experimental targets but was speciﬁc to certain well-known bac-
terial species because few general features exist for extensive pre-
diction. The HSMM model presented by Lifshitz et al. captured
IVB secreted signals with a high success rate but was not usable
for the detection of IVA effectors (Lifshitz et al., 2013). We de-
veloped a widely applicable method for accurate prediction of
different subtypes of T4SS effectors in gram-negative pathogens.
To accomplish this, we calculated ACCs, residue pair compos-
itions, PSSM proﬁles and their auto covariance transformations.
We used these features to train SVM-based predictors for dis-
crimination of effectors from non-effectors.

To assess the performance of our prediction system, two reus-
able datasets were constructed for experimentally validated ef-
fectors and potential non-effectors. ACC analysis showed that
hydrophobic residues, especially aliphatic Ala, Gly and Val,
occur with higher frequencies in non-effectors than in effectors.
On the contrary, hydrophilic and polar residues are more
common components of effector sequences. As most of the
known secreted proteins exist in aqueous environments, such
as the cytoplasm of host cells, residue pairs with hydrophilic
residues would be expected to have higher compositions in
effectors than in non-effectors. We inferred that some hydro-
philic and polar groups may be important for effector protein
functions.

Performance tests showed that two classes of PSSM-based
features were more helpful for discrimination of effectors than
using ACC. The PSSM revealed remote relevance between func-
tion-related proteins. This relevance was conserved throughout
evolution, although amino acids continuously mutated. For the
two PSSM feature classes that we used, PSSM composition indi-
cated the position-speciﬁc information of each amino acid type
in the query sequence. On the other hand, auto covariance trans-
formation of the PSSM described the sequence-order position-
speciﬁc information. The former method performed better than
the latter method in benchmark tests. Feature combination is a
frequently used approach for improving classiﬁcation perform-
ance. We combined four different feature vectors and found that
more accurate results were produced using vector combinations.
The prediction accuracy for IVB effectors was higher than for
IVA effectors. This can be attributed to different numbers of
positive samples and more abundant signals within IVB se-
quences, such as C-terminal motifs, which are more informative
than the known motifs in IVA effectors. We noticed that taxo-
nomic and functional biases in the training data impacted the
assessment and application of our method. In T4_1472, 30 IVA
sequences were derived from the genomic proteins of nine

species, i.e. Amarginale (4), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2),
Bartonella sp.(3), H.pylori (l), Agrobacterium tumefacien (3),
Agrobacterium rhizogenes (4), Brucella sp.(8), B.pertussis (4)
and Erhaﬂeensis (1); 310 IVB effectors were selected from
L.pneum0phila (258) and C.bumetii (52). The taxonomic distri-
bution of IVA sequences showed no obvious bias, but bias was
present for IVB sequences. Although all the effectors were ex-
perimentally validated to be secreted by T4SS, the functions of
most of them in host cells have not been identified. Therefore, the
functional bias of these effectors is still unknown. To reduce bias
for negative sequences, we collected non-effectors through mul-
tiple channels. Though biases in datasets are inevitable, the re-
sults of theoretical validations in several datasets showed that
our predictor was both accurate and robust for distinguishing
T4SS effectors. This indicates that our method may be useful for
IVA effector prediction in various T4SS pathogens but should be
restricted to Legionella sp., Coxiella sp. and their related species
for IVB effector prediction. It is noteworthy that characteristic
signals exist in both some T4SS effectors and some T3SS ef-
fectors 0(u et al., 2010), which may have similar amino acid
distributions and evolutionary conservation profiles. Thus, the
present method may not completely discriminate between T4SS
effectors and those secreted through the T3SS.

We improved the prediction accuracy using multi-classiﬁer
ensembles with simple voting strategies. The 2-in-3 voting and
3-in-4 voting systems are linear discrimination systems that use
condition relaxation. Therefore, accurate prediction does not in-
dicate identical prediction performance in pathogenic genomes.
Accurate discrimination of effectors in bacterial genomes is the
ultimate goal of developing these prediction models. The predic-
tion results for the B.henselae genome demonstrate that our
method is effective at distinguishing unknown T4SS effectors
from genomic sequences. A small list of predicted candidates
will help to easily conﬁrm experimental targets. In the
B.henselae genome, seven genes encoding known effector
proteins were all predicted by our classiﬁer ensemble.
Furthermore, several proteins located at BH1431(%BH14330
and BH1451(LBH14590 were repeatedly predicted as positives
by multi-classiﬁers, indicating strong potential T4SS effectors. In
Supplementary Table S10, 47 out of 50 putative T4SS candidates
are annotated as ‘hypothetical proteins’ in the B.henselae
genome. The left three are inferred to be relevant to T4SS
from Bartonella. Most homologs of these proteins in gram-nega-
tive species are still uncharacterized and the annotated informa-
tion in available public databases shows some of the candidates
are most likely secreted proteins. A maximum likelihood phylo-
genic tree was constructed to reveal the evolutionary relationship
between the 26 IVA effectors and the 50 inferred effectors using
MUSCLE and MEGAS (Supplementary Fig. S4). Conversely,
no phylogenic trees for IVB effectors could be established
by any evolutionary algorithms because no common sites in
these sequences were found when computing the distances.
Supplementary Figure S4 shows that several distinct groups
WP_414449, YP_153762, YP_153570 and YP_505319) were
formed by multiple predicted effectors and an embedded IVA
protein. The seven known effectors of B.henselae were grouped
in a sub-tree, sharing a most recent common ancestor with
BH07480 and displaying close relationships to the putative ef-
fector BH13840. The arrangement of each branch in the tree

indicates that the predicted effectors in each sub-tree were most
likely captured by our model based on the evolutionary infor-
mation of their nearest IVA effectors. We hope that these pre-
dicted effectors may serve as a useful resource for the research
community.

By taking into account all of our results and analyses, we can
conclude that the present method can detect T4SS effectors
within unidentiﬁed sequences with great power. As the features
used in our system are sequence-based and are commonly calcu-
lated across both genus and species, we believe that our method
can be widely used for T4SS effector screening for 10 conﬁrmed
pathogens as well as for other gram-negative bacterial species.

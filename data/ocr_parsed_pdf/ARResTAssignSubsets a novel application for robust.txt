Abstract

Motivation: An ever—increasing body of evidence supports the importance of B cell receptor im—
munoglobulin (BcR IG) sequence restriction, alias stereotypy, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL). This phenomenon accounts for ~30% of studied cases, one in eight ofwhich belong to major
subsets, and extends beyond restricted sequence patterns to shared biologic and clinical character—
istics and, generally, outcome. Thus, the robust assignment of new cases to major CLL subsets is a
critical, and yet unmet, requirement.

Results: We introduce a novel application, ARResT/AssignSubsets, which enables the robust as—
signment of BcR IG sequences from CLL patients to major stereotyped subsets. ARResT/
AssignSubsets uniquely combines expert immunogenetic sequence annotation from IMGT/V—
QUEST with curation to safeguard quality, statistical modeling of sequence features from more
than 7500 CLL patients, and results from multiple perspectives to allow for both objective and sub—
jective assessment. We validated our approach on the learning set, and evaluated its real—world ap—
plicability on a new representative dataset comprising 459 sequences from a single institution.

receptor immunoglobulin (BcR 1G, or antibody) collectively account
for ~30% of cases (Agathangclidis et al., 2012; Darzcntas et al.,
2010), and represent disease sub—entities with shared biologic and
clinical profiles, including outcome (Baliakas et al., 2014; Rossi
et al., 2009; Stamatopoulos et al., 2007). Intriguingly, in the latest
and largest such study of over 75 00 patients, 19 major subsets, each
with at least 20 cases, accounted for 12% of the cohort and 41% of
all stereotyped cases (Agathangclidis et al., 2012). This is remark—
able given the negligible chance, in the range of 1:10”, of finding
two B cell clones with stereotyped BcR IG. Thus, major stereotyped
subsets have attracted great interest.

To date, assignment of new cases to these major subsets has been
based on the ad 1006 application of published criteria (Darzcntas and
Stamatopoulos, 2013), mostly by groups with advanced knowledge
in immunogenetics, and thus with limited applicability, and argu—
ably reliability, in routine practice. We therefore introduce a novel
application, ARResT/AssignSubsets, which enables the robust as—
signment of submitted BcR IG sequences from CLL patients to the
existing 19 major stereotyped subsets.

2 Methods

All sequence datasets used in this work are available through IMGT/
CLL—DB [imgt.org/CLLDBInterface/j in accordance with its bylaws.

Sequence annotation and curation: Immunogenetic annotations
are obtained from IMGT/V—QUEST (Giudicclli et al., 2011), the
widely accepted reference for antigen receptor sequence analysis
(Lefranc, 2014). These annotations are used to extract sequence fea—
tures (e.g. the variable heavy complementarity determining region 3,
or VH CDR3) for the learning and assignment phases below,
but also for the sequences to be validated by ARResT/SeqCure
[bat.infspire.org/arrest/seqcure/j, developed to systematically report
compromising issues based on expert in—house rules applied on
the annotations. Such issues include non—ACGT characters or short
sequence length, both of which compromise sequence annotation;
out—of—frame VH CDR3 with or without stop codons, which implies
an unproductive chain; or absence of a gene rearrangement
altogether.

At the center of ARResT/AssignSubsets lies a set of rules cap—
tured in a probabilistic model, a Bayes classifier implemented in R
[r—project.org].

Learning phase: Learning of the model to be later used for as—
signment was based on a positive set of 929 major subset members,
and a negative set (‘pool’ cohort) of 6 667 sequences belonging to
minor subsets as well as non—subset, heterogeneous cases
(Agathangclidis et al., 2012).

The learning phase evaluates sequence features of these two sets
divided into two groups: core and secondary. Core features are based
on the latest accepted stringent criteria for subset discovery
(Agathangclidis et al., 2012), and if the value of a core feature of a
new sequence is not shared among the members of a subset, then the
sequence cannot be assigned to that subset. Currently, the three core
features are: (i) VH CDR3 length, a critical determinant of the struc—
ture of the antigen recognition loop (Barrios et 41., 2004); (ii) immuno—
globulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene phylogenetic clan, implying
meaningful sequence similarity through common ancestry (Kjrkham
et 41., 1992) and (iii) mutational status of the rearrangement, with
‘mutated’ for <98% nucleotide identity to germline and ‘unmutated’
otherwise, an important prognostic indicator in patients with CLL
(Damlc et al., 1999; Hamblin et al., 1999). Secondary features are less
strictly controlled for, i.e. unobserved values are accepted (but scored

negatively)—these are: (i) rearranged IGHV and immunoglobulin
heavy joining genes; and (ii) the VH CDR3 amino acid sequence
through amino acid frequencies at any given sequence position.

To keep the model robust and avoid overfitting, the Bayesian net—
work topology is kept as simple as possible, with only obvious depend—
encies captured: VH CDR3 amino acid frequencies at any position,
and relative frequencies of rearranged IGHV genes of the same phylo—
genetic clan. To avoid creating unrealistically stringent criteria, we in—
clude a ‘relaxation’ coefficient to the probability calculation of the
observed frequency of each feature in all available sequences. Finally,
to reduce the ‘noise’ created by relatively less frequent values, we apply
the power function on the probability distribution of each feature.

Assignment phase: Assignment is based on evaluating submitted
sequence features with the learned Bayesian model. Each sequence first
acquires an absolute score for each major subset of the positive set and
for the negative set or ‘pool’ cohort. The absolute score is the minus
logarithm of the exact probability of assigning to a set, with ‘—Inf’
(minus infinity) meaning that the sequence core features did not match
the subset core features. The difference between the absolute score of
each major subset and that of the ‘pool’ cohort is then calculated as a
relative score, with positive numbers for submitted sequences closer to
subsets than to the ‘pool’ cohort. Assignment to the best—scoring subset
uses a per—subset threshold, based on the range of scores achieved by
existing members of that subset. The difference between the relative
score and the subset threshold is ‘translated’ to confidence, ranging
from ‘borderline’ to ‘extreme’, to further assist the user.

Output: Real—time output consists of progress reports, links, in—
formation and help, results and tables. These include the detailed
ARResT/SeqCure report on the ‘health’ of the submitted sequences;
absolute and relative frequencies of assignment to each of the 19
major CLL subsets; and an assignment report for each submitted se—
quence, including its ‘health’, the confidence of the assignment, and,
when possible, heat maps of core and secondary features with their
significance with respect to the submitted sequence and the best—
scoring, but not necessarily assigned, subset. Additional information
can be found in the Supplementary data and on the home page of
ARResT/AssignSubsets.

3 Results

To validate ARResT/AssignSubsets we performed 100 learning and
assignment runs, each using randomly selected 80% of the 7596 se—
quences of our full cohort for learning, and the remaining 20% as
‘new’ sequences for assigning. False—positives (i.e. of the ‘pool’ co—
hort but assigned to a subset, or falsely assigned) and false—negatives
(i.e. of a subset but assigned to the ‘pool’ cohort, or falsely un—
assigned) were closely inspected. We confirm high levels of average
specificity (99.7%), sensitivity (95.2%) and overall accuracy
(99.2%). Favoring specificity is by design, due to the potentially im—
portant clinical implications of the assignment results.

To evaluate the applicability and robustness of ARResT/
AssignSubsets to a real—world situation, we analyzed 459 new se—
quences from the University of Athens, Greece (now also in IMGT/
CLL—DB), a cohort representative of our larger cohort in terms of
IGHV gene repertoire and mutational status. Our results confirmed
the published incidence of major subsets (~12%), with 48/459
(10.5%) sequences assigned to 15/19 major subsets. Subsets 1 and 4
acquired almost half of the new assignments (13 and 10 cases, re—
spectively), as expected, while subset 2 was under—represented in
this Mediterranean population, confirming geographic biases (Ghia
et al., 2005).

4 Conclusions

CLL is clinically and biologically heterogeneous, and still incurable,
and could benefit from accurate prognostic markers and classifiers,
in an effort to implement rationally designed treatment(s). Indeed,
studies focusing on major CLL subsets, which, remarkably, describe
one in eight CLL patients, have revealed subset—biased biologic and
clinical behaviors (Baliakas et al., 2014; Rossi et al., 2009;
Stamatopoulos et al., 2007). ARResT/AssignSubsets is an important
step towards enabling scientists to tap into this expanding know—
ledge in a robust and standardized way.

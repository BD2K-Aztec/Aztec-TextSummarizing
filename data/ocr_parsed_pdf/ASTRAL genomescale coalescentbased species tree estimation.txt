ASTRAL is more accurate than the other summary methods
under all the simulated model conditions we explore. As
expected, the relative accuracy of ASTRAL and concatenation
depends on the amount of ILS, with ASTRAL having an advan—
tage when ILS levels are at least moderate, and concatenation
having an advantage when ILS levels are low. Thus, ASTRAL
enables highly accurate large—scale phylogenomic estimation,
even in the presence of high levels of gene tree conﬂict because
of ILS.

2 APPROACH

The input to ASTRAL is a set of unrooted gene trees; ASTRAL
ﬁnds the species tree that agrees with the largest number of quar—
tet trees induced by the set of gene trees.

This optimization problem is NP—hard (Jiang et al., 2001), and
so ASTRAL has two versions: an exact version that is guaran—
teed to return the globally optimal tree, and a heuristic version
that can be used on large datasets. For the heuristic version,
ASTRAL constrains the search space to reduce the running
time, by including a set X of bipartitions (splits of the leaf set
into two disjoint sets) as part of the input, and requiring that the
output species tree T draw its bipartitions from X. Thus, for
every edge e in T, the deletion of e splits the leaf set into two
parts, and that bipartition must be in X. Finding a tree that has
the optimum score but draws its bipartitions from the set X can
be solved in polynomial time (Theorem 1). Thus, ASTRAL can
be used to find optimal trees for small enough numbers of spe—
cies, or heuristically for larger numbers of species. We formalize
this approach as the Maximum Quartet Support Species Tree
(MQSST) problem:

0 Input: set T of unrooted gene trees, each leaf—labelled by
species set S, and set X of bipartitions on S.

0 Output: tree T on species set S that draws its bipartitions
from X such that quQm w(q, T) is maximized, where Q(T)
is the set of quartet trees induced by T and w(q, T) is the
number of the trees in T that induce quartet topology (1.

The default mode sets X to be all bipartitions from the input
set of unrooted gene trees; however, X can be any set of
bipartitions.

We note that MQSST takes into account the relative fre—
quency of all three alternative quartet topologies and weights
them accordingly. Thus, if the dominant (i.e. most frequent)
quartet topology is much more frequent than the alternatives,
trees that do not induce the dominant topology are penalized,
but if the three alternative quartet topologies all have frequencies
close to 1/3, that quartet will contribute little to the optimization
problem. This approach is in contrast to some other quartet—
based methods such as BUCKy—pop that first try to ﬁnd the
dominant quartet topologies and then summarize them.
Estimation of the dominant quartet tree is susceptible to error
(because of insufﬁcient gene sampling and estimation error), and
the MQSST accounts for this.

ASTRAL uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to
solve the MQSST optimization problem, so that it does not
need to explicitly enumerate the set of all possible quartet
trees. For a given unrooted binary tree T and four leaves i,j, k,

I in the tree, the induced subtree of T connecting the four leaves
will have exactly two nodes 14 and v that have degree >2. Thus, a
quartet tree on i,j, k,l induced by an unrooted binary tree is
associated to the pair of nodes {14, v} deﬁned in this way.
Furthermore, given any node x of the tree, it is easy to count
the number of quartets that are associated to pairs {.x, y} (for
some other node y), as we now show. Deleting x from the tree T
separates it into three parts, A, B and C; this is called a ‘tripar—
tition’ and is denoted (AIBIC). We pick one of these sets (say A),
and pick two leaves from it, and then pick one leaf from each of
the remaining sets. Therefore, if a, b and c give the sizes of A, B
and C, respectively, then the number of quartets mapped to u is

a b c + + _
be + a c + ab = w. Therefore, we
2 2 2 2

can associate the quartet tree on i,j, k, 1 induced by T with two
tripartitionsione associated with the internal node 14 and the
other associated with the internal node v, where the quartet
tree is associated with the pair {14, v}.

Our algorithm uses a DP approach that is similar to the DP
algorithm ﬁrst introduced in Hallett and Lagergren (2000) for
constructing species trees from sets of gene trees, minimizing the
total number of duplications and losses, and subsequently used
to construct species trees minimizing deep coalescence (Yu et al.,
2011). Instead of explicitly calculating quartet trees, we use the
set X to generate a set of tripartitions, and then for each tripar—
tition, we calculate the number of quartet trees induced by the
input set of gene trees that would be associated to that triparti—
tion and therefore would be satisﬁed by any species tree that
includes that tripartition. Thus, the species tree can be con—
structed by calculating a score for individual tripartitions based
on a recursive formula that defines the DP.

Recall that X is a set of bipartitions that can be used in the
output tree T; we deﬁne X* to be the set of subsets of S that
appear as parts of these bipartitions (i.e. A e X * if and only if the
bipartition (A|S — A) e X). Then, the recursion in the DP ﬁnds a
way of dividing each set A e X* into A/ and A — A/ (each of
which must be in X *) such that the number of quartets satisﬁed
by an optimal rooted tree on A/ and A — A/, in addition to those
satisﬁed by the tripartition (A/|A —A’|S —A), is maximized.
Thus, the recursion is given by

C(A) = max (C(A/)+ C(A — A/)+ W(A/|A — A/lS — A))
A’CA;A’eX*

where W(A|B|C) counts the number of gene tree quartets asso—
ciated to tripartition (AIBIC) (which we call the weight of the
tripartition). The function C(X) denotes the total contribution to
the support of the best rooted tree T X on taxon set X, where each
quartet tree in the set of input gene trees contributes 0 if it con—
flicts with T X or only intersects it with one leaf, and otherwise
contributes 1 or 2, depending on the number of nodes in T X it
maps to. We set the boundary condition to be C({x}) = 0. At the
end of the algorithm, C(S) gives the ﬁnal score, and backtracking
gives the ﬁnal tree. Because each quartet is associated to exactly
two nodes, our described DP counts each quartet tree induced by
gene trees exactly twice, and hence, the ﬁnal score needs to be
divided by two to get the quartet score.

The weight of a tripartition is calculated by counting the
number of quartet trees mapped to each node of each gene

tree that is also mapped to that tripartition. For calculating this,
we just need to ﬁnd the intersection of clusters of the tripartition
and all the tripartitions from all gene trees (see Supplementary
Materials). For the special case of A = S, we set
W(A‘|A — A‘|S — A) =0.

THEOREM 1. ASTRALfinds an optimal solution to MQSST, and
runs in 0(n2x2k) time, where n is the number of species, x is the
number of bipartitions in X and k is the number of gene trees. If X
is the set of bipartitions from the input gene trees, then x = 0(nk),
and so ASTRAL runs in 0(n4k3) time.

Because of space constraints, we provide the proof in the
Supplementary Materials.

THEOREM 2. ASTRAL is a statistically consistent estimator of the
species tree topology under the multi—species coalescent model, even
when run in default modeLso that X is the set of bipartitions from
the input gene trees.

Proof Sketch: Let T* be the species tree. Given a candidate spe—
cies tree T, let wT(q, T) be the number of trees in T that induce a
topology identical to T for a quartet q of taxa. Unrooted quartet
trees do not have anomaly zones (Degnan, 2013); therefore,
given a large enough number of gene trees, each quartet topology
induced by the species tree will have higher probability than
either of the two alternative topologies, and hence appear with
greater frequency in T with high probability. Therefore, for
every quartet q and every possible tree T, wT(q, F) 3 wT(q, T)
with high probability. By extension, if Q is the set of all quartets
of taxa, the score CT(T) = qug wT(q, T) attains its (unique) max—

imum value when T =T* with high probability. CT(T) is the
score optimized in MQSST; hence, when ASTRAL is run exactly
it solves MQSST and so is statistically consistent. The con—
strained default version of ASTRAL is also statistically consist—
ent because when a large enough number of gene trees is given,
then with high probability at least one of the gene trees will be
topologically identical to the species tree, T“, and so the set X
will contain all the bipartitions from T“. When this occurs,
ASTRAL run in its default mode will return T*. (Note also
that X may contain all the bipartitions from T* even without
having T* among its gene trees.)

Note that the MQSST optimization problem could be expressed
as ﬁnding a median tree, where instead of ﬁnding a species tree that
maximizes the total number of quartet trees that it satisﬁes, we
would seek a species tree that has a minimum total distance to
the input gene trees, where the distance is the number of quartet
trees that it violates. Then, Theorem 2 asserts that the median tree
(under this deﬁnition) is a statistically consistent estimator of the
species tree, under the multi—species coalescent model.

3 EXPERIMENTS

Overview. We explore performance on a collection of biologi—
cal and simulated datasets. We compare the estimated species
trees to the model species tree (for the simulated datasets) or
to the scientiﬁc literature (for the biological datasets), to evaluate
accuracy. Tree error is measured using the RobinsoniFoulds
(RF) (Robinson and Foulds, 1981) rate; because all trees esti—
mated here are completely bifurcating, this is the same as the

missing branch rate (proportion of internal edges in the model
tree missing in the estimated tree).

IOO—taxon simulated datasets. We brieﬂy describe the process
used to generate these data, and direct the reader to the original
publication (Yang and Warnow, 2011) for details. The 100—taxon
model species tree was created by a birth41eath process, and 25
genes evolved within the species tree under the multi—species coa—
lescent, producing ultrametric gene trees. Nucleotide sequences
with 1000 sites were evolved down each gene tree under a process
with GTRGAMMA substitutions as well as insertions and dele—
tions, using ROSE (Stoye et al., 1998). True alignments were
used to generate estimated gene trees using RAxML.

37—taxon ‘mammalian’ simulated datasets. We simulated this
collection of datasets based on a 37—taxon mammalian dataset
with 447 genes studied in Song et al. (2012). First, we used MP—
EST to estimate a species tree on the biological dataset from
Song et al. (2012), and then used it as a model species tree,
with branch lengths in coalescent units. We evolved gene trees
down the model tree under the multi—species coalescent model
using Dendropy (Sukumaran and Holder, 2010), and then
rescaled the gene trees to deviate from the molecular clock and
produce branch length patterns observed in the biological data—
set. We then evolved sequences with 500 and 1000 sites down
each gene tree under the GTR model of site evolution, using
GTR parameters estimated on the biological dataset. This pro—
duces the ‘default’ model condition that has the amount of ILS
estimated for this dataset by MP—EST. We varied this protocol
by scaling the model species tree branch lengths up (2x and 5x)
or down (0.2>< and 0.5><) to modify the amount of ILS (so that
longer branch lengths reduces ILS, and shorter branch lengths
increases ILS). The default model tree conditions (including the
number of genes, sequence length distribution and amount of
ILS) were set to produce a dataset called the ‘mixed condition’
that most resembled the biological dataset.

The average bootstrap support (BS) in the biological data was
71%, and so we generated sequence lengths that produced esti—
mated gene trees with BS values bracketing that value7500 bp
alignments produced estimated gene trees with 63% average BS
and 1000 bp alignments produced estimated gene trees with 79%
BS. The ‘mixed dataset’ of 400 genes was produced using 200
genes with 63% BS and 200 genes with 79% BS, and had average
BS of 71%7like the biological data.

For each model condition (speciﬁed by the ILS level, the
number of genes and the sequence length), we created 20 repli—
cates, except for the 1600— and 3200—gene model conditions where
we created 10 and 5 replicates, respectively. We then used
RAxML to produce estimated gene trees on the simulated
sequence alignments, and we generated 200 ML bootstrap repli—
cates for the mixed dataset.

Biological datasets. We analysed three biological datasets: the
mammalian dataset from Song et al. (2012), containing 37 spe—
cies and 447 genes, the plant dataset from Zhong et al. (2013),
containing 32 species and 184 genes, and also the amniota data—
set from Chiari et al. (2012), containing 16 species and 248 genes.

Methods. We compare ASTRAL with MP—EST, BUCKy—pop
(the population tree from BUCKy), MRP (a supertree method),

Fig. 3. Analysis of the Song et al. mammals dataset using ASTRAL and
MP-EST. We show the result of applying ASTRAL and MP-EST to 424
gene trees on 37-taxon mammalian species. MP-EST is based on rooted
gene trees; ASTRAL is based on unrooted gene trees, and then rooted
at the branch leading to the outgroup. Branch support values in black
are for both methods, those in red are for ASTRAL and values in blue
are for MP-EST. See Supplementary Materials for trees with full
resolution

Plant dataset. We analysed a plant dataset from Zhong et al.
(2013) of 32 species and 184 genes using ASTRAL, adding bipar—
titions to X (see Supplementary Materials). The question of
greatest interest is the sister group to land plants. Previous
analyses have inferred many different possible sister clades,
including the following four major hypotheses: Zygnematales,
Coleochaetales, Zygnematales + Coleochaetales and Charales.
Zhong et al. (2013) used MP—EST to analyse their data and
inferred Zygnematales as the sister with 64% BS. A reanalysis
of the same data using STAR was performed by Springer and
Gatesy (2014), who obtained Zygnematales + Coleochaetales
with 44% BS.

We analysed this dataset using ASTRAL and obtained a tree
that generally has high BS on the branches (i.e. with the excep—
tion of four branches, all branches have support at least 86%,
and most have 100% support). However, one edge had low
support (only 18%). After collapsing the single branch with
low support, we obtained a tree (see Supplementary Materials)
in which the Charales + land plants hypothesis is rejected
with moderately high support (86%); however, it is
not determined whether Zygnematales, Coleochaetales or
Zygnematales + Coleochaetales are the sister group to land
plants (the branch that distinguishes between these three hypoth—
eses is the one with 18% support). Thus, ASTRAL’s analysis of
this dataset can be seen as suggesting that this dataset is insufﬁ—
cient to completely resolve the sister relationship to land plants.
However, the most interesting question is whether Charales are
sister to land plants, and the ASTRAL tree rejects that hypoth—
esis with 86% support.

Amniota dataset. Chiari et al. (2012) assembled a dataset of
Amniota to resolve the position of turtles relative to birds and
crocodiles. Most recent studies favour an Archosaurus hypoth—
eses that unites birds and crocodiles as sister groups (Hugall

et al., 2007). The MP—EST analyses by Chiari et al. (2012)
resolved this relationship differently when AA and DNA gene
trees were used; thus, AA had 99% support for the Archosaurus
clade, but DNA rejected Archosaurus with 90% support. We
analysed the same dataset using the exact version of ASTRAL
and found that both AA and DNA recover Archosaurus; how—
ever, while ASTRAL on AA gene trees recovered Archosaurus
with 100% support, ASTRAL on DNA gene trees had only 55%
support for Archosaurus.

Running time. Comparisons between coalescent—based methods
reveal substantial differences in running time. For example, on
the mammalian dataset from Song et al. (2012) with 37 taxa and
421 genes, MP—EST (run with 10 random starting points) used
83 min per bootstrap replicate, while ASTRAL used 7 s.
Analyses of the simulated mammalian datasets allow us to
explore the limits of BUCKy—pop, as well as obtain other com—
parisons. We examine running times under moderate ILS, gene
sequences of length 500 bp, and with 400 and 800 genes and with
bestML input trees (except for BUCKy—pop).

BUCKy—pop strictly runs in serial, using a Bayesian Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, which can take a long
time and substantial memory to reach convergence. On the
37—taxon mammalian simulated datasets, BUCKy—pop ran to
completion for datasets with up to 400 genes (where it took
~5 h), but failed to complete (due to memory issues) on the
800—gene dataset.

MP—EST completed relatively quicklyi~100 minifor both
the 400—gene and 800—gene datasets. We ran MP—EST with 10
random starting points, so this time could be reduced by using
just one starting point, but with a potential decrease in accuracy.

ASTRAL completed in 3.3s on the 400—gene dataset and
in 5.3 s on the 800—gene dataset. Thus, ASTRAL is dramatically
faster than the other methods and able to run on these phyloge—
nomic datasets in reasonable time frames. However, BUCKy
is used with 200 bootstrapped gene trees for each gene and out—
puts support values. Running ASTRAL and MP—EST using
MLBS to obtain support values would increase their running
times if run in serial, but ASTRAL would still be much faster
than BUCKy (e.g. 11min on the 400—gene dataset rather than
5 h). In addition, parallelizing MLBS is trivial because each boot—
strap replicate is independent. See Supplementary Materials for
more information about running times under different model
conditions.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This study introduced ASTRAL, a method for estimating species
trees from unrooted gene trees. We proved that ASTRAL is
statistically consistent under the multi—species coalescent model.
In our study, ASTRAL was more accurate than MP—EST and
BUCKy—pop, two leading coalescent—based methods, and
improved or matched the accuracy of CA—ML under many
conditions, except when the amount of ILS was low, where
concatenation was more accurate. Results on the biological
datasets show that statistically consistent coalescent—based meth—
ods can differ in terms of support for established clades, and
produce different resolutions of biologically interesting
relationships.

ASTRAL: genome-scale species tree estimation

 

The differences in performance are the result of different
algorithmic techniques, which can result in greater or lesser
robustness to missing data (Springer and Gatesy, 2014) and
gene tree estimation error (Bayzid and Warnow, 2013). Hence,
the choice of coalescent—based method matters. This study
also showed that concatenation can be more accurate than coa—
lescent—based estimation, provided that the amount of ILS is low
enough. However, the best coalescent—based methods can be
more accurate than concatenation under biologically realistic
conditions.

This study suggests the possibility that some of the observed
discrepancies between previous coalescent—based analyses and
concatenation in previous studies (Springer and Gatesy, 2014)
might be the result of the choice of coalescent—based method,
and that improved coalescent—based analyses might not only
help to identify alternate relationships but might also confirm
prior hypotheses produced using concatenation.

The algorithmic design of ASTRAL can be improved. When
run in default mode, ASTRAL’s accuracy is limited by the bipar—
titions in the input gene trees. Including estimated species trees in
X enlarges the search space and allows ASTRAL to produce
highly accurate species trees, but other less ad hoc approaches
for expanding X should also be developed. The running time we
have given is polynomial and fast enough to run on genome—scale
datasets, but improved algorithmic designs with better asympto—
tic performance could also be developed.

Using bootstrap replicate gene trees instead of best ML gene
trees did not improve species tree estimation accuracy on the
simulated mixed mammalian datasetiand in fact made species
tree estimations less accurate for MRP, MP—EST and ASTRAL.
This suggests the possibility that the topological error in boot—
strap gene trees is large enough to offset any improvement in
species tree estimation obtained by taking gene tree uncertainty
into account. However, it is possible that an improvement might
be obtained under other conditions, or that using a sample of
gene trees estimated by a Bayesian MCMC analysis might be
better—suited to coalescent—based species tree estimation methods
than maximum likelihood bootstrap trees, as suggested by
DeGiorgio and Degnan (2014) [although see Yang and
Warnow (2011)]. Knowles et al. (2012) found varying impact
in species tree topology estimation through taking gene tree esti—
mation error into account, but only examined small numbers of
species and genes; thus, to some extent, the results we obtained
might be because of the large number of genes and perhaps
species in our studies.

In summary, advances in algorithmic strategies for coalescent—
based estimation can enable highly accurate species tree
estimation in the presence of massive ILS. ASTRAL provides
one such advance, but new and more accurate coalescent—based
methods are needed to enable these analyses, especially for
genome—scale datasets where missing data and extremely low
phylogenetic signal in individual genes may be a substantial
problem.

Brownian phylogenetic models

 

process, which is again a (now matrix—valued) random variable
whose distribution is not directly computable.

Exact likelihood calculation under Brownian substitution
models therefore appears to be computationally intractable. As
a result, implementations of these models have thus far relied on
rather crude approximations. Typically, the Brownian process is
explicitly sampled only at the internal nodes of the phylogeny,
corresponding to cladogenetic events (Lepage et al., 2007;
Thorne et al., 1998) or at the midpoints along the branches
(Rannala and Yang, 2007). The total rate along each branch is
then approximated by the average of the instant rates at both
ends or by the midpoint value. Similar approximations have been
used for more general substitution models (Lartillot and Poujol,
2011; Seo et al., 2004).

Such approximate strategies appear to yield qualitatively
reasonable results when tested on simulations (Lartillot and
Poujol, 2011). However, the quality of the approximation
could deteriorate for particular rate variation patterns across
phylogenies or for particular configurations of time—dependent
substitution parameters. More fundamentally, these approxima—
tions ignore the fact that the integrated substitution probabilities
across branches are themselves random, even conditional on the
values of the Brownian process at the nodes. In practice, the
additional dispersion induced by this speciﬁc level of randomness
will be buffered by other aspects of the model, in particular by
the Brownian process itself, thus potentially resulting in artifac—
tually increased variance in trait or rate evolution. This phenom—
enon could have important consequences in a comparative
context, where the covariance between substitution rates and
quantitative traits is of direct interest. All these arguments
suggest that current approximation schemes fundamentally
lack robustness. In a long—term perspective, as ever more com—
plex time—dependent substitution models are being contemplated,
the reliability of the approach will become increasingly question—
able, potentially compromising the idea of a principled model—
based approach to the molecular comparative method.

The approximation resulting from sampling the trajectories of
the Brownian process at a ﬁnite number of time points could
easily be controlled by explicitly sampling the process over a
sufﬁciently ﬁne—grained discretization grid along each branch.
Doing so, however, raises several computational problems.
First, it results in a high—dimensional space of possible model
conﬁgurations, many of which have a similar fit to the data.
Efﬁcient Monte Carlo sampling methods therefore need to be
developed to mix over this large set of possible model conﬁgur—
ations. Obviously, simple MetropolisiHastings schemes updat—
ing one instantaneous value at a time will not scale properly in
this context, and therefore, direct resampling of entire paths,
either along or across branches, is necessary. Second, in the con—
text of complex Brownian substitution models, for a given
branch and a given trajectory of the Brownian process, efficient
methods are needed to approximate the substitution probabilities
over the branch implied by this trajectory.

In this article, an integrated solution to these computational
challenges is introduced, in the form of a Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) framework for calculating the likelihood
and sampling from the posterior distribution over Brownian
substitution models. The approach combines a discretization
scheme along the lines just suggested with path—resampling and

data—augmentation MCMC algorithms, so as to achieve approxi—
mate sampling from the posterior distribution in a time that
scales reasonably well with the level of discretization.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Models and priors

The models considered here have been introduced earlier (Lartillot and
Poujol, 2011; Lartillot, 2013a). The ﬁrst model is time-homogenous.
It assumes a general time-reversible nucleotide substitution process,
homogeneous across sites and along the phylogeny (measured in time,
relative to the age of the root), except for the overall substitution rate r(t),
which is time-dependent, log-normal Brownian and correlated with a
vector of L quantitative traits, denoted C,, I: 1..L. Thus, the Brownian
process X(t) has dimension M = L + l:

X10) = ln r(t)
1:1..L, X1+1(t)=ln C10)

The second model is time-heterogeneous. It assumes correlated variation
of the substitution rate and the equilibrium GC content with quantitative
traits. Speciﬁcally, the nucleotide substitution process is parameterized as
follows (see also Lartillot, 2013a):
y y 1 — y
DAC 2 pAG 2 pAT 2
1 — y — pCG Z PC 2
2 T 2
Q?) = y y (1)
pCG E — pGT 2

 

 

J/ J/ J/
pAT T pCT E pGT E —

where y is the equilibrium GC frequency, and pr is the relative ex-
changeability between nucleotides X and Y. Then, variation in r, y and
C is modeled as a Brownian process of dimension M = L + 2:
X10) = ln r(t)
W)
1 - V0)
1:1..L, X1+2(t)=ln C10)

X2“) = 1n

 

For the two models, the Brownian process X(t) is parameterized by an
M X M covariance matrix 2, endowed with an inverse Wishart prior of
parameter 20 = Diag(n1, . . . , 71M), and with M degrees of freedom, where
7],“, m = 1..M are themselves from a truncated Jeffrey’s prior, on
[10’3 , 103]. The prior distribution of X at the root is truncated uniform,
on [—100, 100]. The phylogeny is ﬁxed, and a uniform prior is used for
divergence times. All other aspects of the model, including the priors, are
as in Lartillot (2013a).

2.2 Discretization scheme

As illustrated in Figure l, a global discretization grid is deﬁned by a series
of P + I regularly spaced absolute sampling times between the root and
the tips of the phylogeny, deﬁning P time intervals of length 8t: l/P
(times are relative to the age of the root). The Brownian process is
sampled at all points where the tree and the grid intersect, as well as at
the bifurcating nodes. In the following, superscripts will index branches,
while subscripts will index successive discretization points along each
branch. Note that the branchwise approximation classically used
(Lartillot and Poujol, 2011; Lepage et al., 2007; Thorne et al., 1998)
corresponds to P = l.

denoted X1011), for k = 1..M. The joint probability of the Brownian path
is given by the following chain rule:

2.3 Likelihood computation

The main idea proposed here is to approximate the continuous trajec-
tories of the instant substitution rate, r(t), and equilibrium GC, y(t), such
as deﬁned by the Brownian process, by trajectories that are piecewise
constant within each time interval deﬁned by the discretization. The
values of r(t) and y(t) within each interval are taken as the average of
the values at both ends of the interval. Once this is done, integrating the
substitution rates over the branch can proceed as usual. The overall error
induced by this approximation is proportional to the resolution 8t, and
can therefore be made arbitrarily small by using sufﬁciently ﬁne-grained
discretizations.

In the case of the time-homogeneous model, for branch j, the total rate
(which is the substitutional length of the branch) is approximated by

"/
11:2:(111—11171

i=1

) eX/(t/) + eX/(t/il)

and the matrix giving the substitution probabilities over branch j is simply
m=wQ (m

In the case of the time-heterogeneous substitution model, the rate matrix
also depends on time, through the second entry of the Brownian process,
describing the logit of the instant equilibrium GC. Speciﬁcally, for each
time point i=0..n’, the instant equilibrium GC at If is given by

X201)
. - e _ I
W” ’ 

The equilibrium GC over the ith time interval is then assumed to be
constant and equal to the average of the instantaneous values at both
ends:

_;V@J+W&
342+

A rate matrix  = Q07?) is then calculated by setting y =71: in Equation 1.
Finally, the matrix giving the substitution probabilities over the entire
branch is given by

,1/
R1 = H 80.141091 (3)

i=1

Equation 3 requires efﬁcient computation of matrix exponentials of
the form 85’9 for small 8t and for arbitrary Q. This exponentiation can be
done by repeated squaring, i.e. by relying on the fact that

, 2“ 6t 2"
6&9: (e37) : (1+ fQ)

This approximation requires a total of 3 matrix products. The accuracy is
controlled by choosing s dynamically, such that maxk  |Qkk| is less than
some predeﬁned threshold. Here, a threshold of 0.01 is used. In practice,
for moderately ﬁne-grained discretization schemes (St: 0.01), s is most
often equal to l, and therefore, the overall calculation of Rf requires a
total of En’ : n’ matrix products.

2.4 Markov chain Monte Carlo

The ﬁne-grained discretization scheme introduced here results in a high
dimensional model conﬁguration, with strong correlations between the
values of the Brownian process at neighboring time points. Simple
MCMC procedures updating one instantaneous value of X at a time
will be extremely inefﬁcient in this context, and alternative algorithms
should therefore be developed. An efﬁcient approach to this problem is
to rely on a combination of several general strategies for updating
the Brownian paths, possibly in combination with other components
of the model (in particular, the divergence times and the covariance
matrix).

The ﬁrst strategy is to add a Brownian bridge to the current
Brownian path along a branch. Brownian bridges are Brownian paths
conditioned on starting and ending at 0. Adding a bridge to a path
therefore results in an update of the entire path that leaves the two end
points unchanged (Fig. 2A). The amplitude of the Brownian bridge
can be set to any desired level, thus leading to ﬂexible tuning of the
proposal.

The second strategy aims at simultaneously resampling the three
Brownian paths surrounding an interior node of the tree. Here, this is
done by applying a simple uniform sliding move proposal to the value of
X at the focal node and propagating this change linearly over the three
surrounding paths, such that their other end points remain constant
(Fig. 2B).

The third strategy proposes a local resampling of the current Brownian
path on a small time-interval, conditional on the values of the path at the
endpoints. This strategy is useful in a context where the local time con-
ﬁguration itself is being updated (Fig. 2C and D).

An important basic tool for devising all these path resampling pro-
posals is to sample Brownian paths conditional on the end points.
Consider for instance a Brownian path (X (t)),:0__T of generator 2. We
wish to sample a discretized realization of X(t) along an arbitrary se-
quence of time points between 0 and T: 0=t0<t1< . .. <t,,= T, and
such that X (0) = a and X (T) = b. This can be done by iteratively sampling
Xi+1|Xi,X,,, for i=1..n — 1. At each step, one can use the conjugate
normal relation:

Xi+1 |Xi ~ N(Xiv(ti+l — l3):)
X" | Xi+1 ~ N(Xi+1~ (1n — 1241):)
so that

This sampling algorithm can be generalized to bifurcating Brownian
paths. Consider three paths, (X“(t)),:0__r,, (Xl(t)),:0__r and (Xr(t)),:0__TI
(indexed by u for up, I for left and r for right), all of generator 2 and
connected at the bifurcation point Z = X“(T‘) = X1(0) = XT(0). We wish
to sample from this bifurcating conﬁguration, conditional on the end
points X“(0)=a, X1(T1)=b and Xr(T)=c. This can be done by ﬁrst
sampling

Z I X”(0)=a, X’(T’)=b, X(T) = c

and then sampling each path independently, conditional on its end
points. To sample Z |a,b,c, the argument is the same
as above, although now with three factors in the conjugate normal
relation.

With these basic building blocks, the following series of update mech-
anisms can be proposed:

0 ONEPATHMOVE (Fig. 2A). Choose a branch at random. Along this
branch, sample a Brownian bridge of covariance matrix 82, where 8
is a tuning parameter. Add this Brownian bridge to the current
Brownian path along the branch, recompute the likelihood and
apply the MetropolisiHastings decision rule. By symmetry of the un-
directed Brownian motion, the Hastings ratio of this proposal is l.
Letting the tuning parameter 8 go to 0 results in arbitrarily small
moves.

THREEPATHMOVE (Fig. 2B). Take an interior node at random; pro-
pose a small random change to the value of the process 2 at this
node: z’=z+8m, where m~N(0. 2) and 8 is a tuning parameter.
Propagate the change linearly over the three surrounding branches;
recompute the likelihood and apply the MetropolisiHastings deci-
sion rule. Hastings ratio is l.

TIMEPATHMOVE (Fig. 2C). Updating divergence times: take an inter-
ior node at random, shift the divergence time by a random amount
drawn uniformly in [—8/2, 8/2], where 8 is a tuning parameter.
Reﬂect divergence time within allowed interval if necessary. Deﬁne
the smallest on-grid window around the focal node encompassing
both the current and the proposed dates for the focal node. Within
this window, resample the Brownian path over the three branches,
conditional on the three end points. For this move, the Hastings ratio
exactly compensates for the probability of the Brownian path in the
window, and therefore, the MetropolisiHastings ratio is simply
equal to the ratio of the likelihoods of the ﬁnal and the initial
conﬁgurations.

The three update proposals just mentioned are conditional on the current
covariance matrix 2. This covariance matrix can in turn be resampled
conditional on the current conﬁguration of Brownian paths across
branches. This can be done using conjugate Gibbs sampling (as in
Lartillot and Poujol, 2011). However, this simple alternation between
updates of X conditional on 2 and updates of 2 conditional on X turn
out to be inefﬁcient for large P (small 8t, see Section 4). Thus, an add-
itional joint update of the matrix and the Brownian paths was devised,
simply consisting of applying the same linear transformation to all paths
and to the covariance matrix:

0 LINEARBROWNIANSIGMAMOVE. Construct a random M X M matrix
by drawing each entry i.i.d. from a standard normal distribution:
Mij~N(0, 1). Set G=€5M, where 8 is a tuning parameter. Note that
exponential matrices are always invertible and that a value of 8 close
to 0 will result in a matrix G close to the identity matrix. Apply the
transformation X ’ = GX uniformly across all instantaneous values of
the Brownian process across the phylogeny (including the root).
Simultaneously, set 2’ = GEG’ , where G’ is the matrix transpose of G.
Recompute the probability of the entire model and apply the
MetropolisiHastings rule. The Hastings ratio of this move is equal to
|G|N+2, where |G| is the determinant of G and N is the number of
instantaneous values of the Brownian process instantiated over the
entire tree.

Note that most of the Hastings ratio in fact cancels out with the ratio of
the probability of the new and the old conﬁguration of the Brownian
process. For a generic instantaneous value X (except the root):

pm I 2’) : IE’I*%e*%X”2’*1X’ : Iz’r1
17(XIE) I2 *éeeéx’z‘” Izr

There are N 71 such values, which will therefore compensate for all but
three occurrences of |G| in the Hastings ratio. This point is important,
allowing the Hastings ratio to remain under control even for high-
dimensional models.

2.5 Data augmentation

To improve computational efﬁciency, the MCMC proposals described
above are used in combination with data augmentation. The data aug-
mentation strategy developed here is different from the one most often
used (such as described in Lartillot, 2006; Lartillot and Poujol, 2011;
Mateiu and Rannala, 2006; Nielsen, 2002), in that it does not rely on a
detailed substitution history along the branches of the tree. Instead, the
augmentation at each site consists only of the ancestral nucleotide
sequences at the interior nodes of the tree. Sampling ancestral sequences
conditional on current parameter values can be done independently for
each site, using a standard backwardiforward algorithm (Nielsen, 2002).
Then, for each branch and for the root, the following sufﬁcient statistics
are collected across sites: the number of sites going from nucleotide a at
the beginning of branch j to nucleotide b at the end of the branch,
(I’lib)u‘b:A‘CG‘7-, and the number of sites in each possible nucleotide
state in the ancestral sequence at the root, (mu)u:A‘CG‘T. Conditional
on this data augmentation, when applying one of the Metropolisi
Hastings proposals described above, only local probability factors, cor-
responding to those branches on which Brownian paths have changed,
need to be recomputed. The probability factor contributed by branch j is
given by (Rf-1b)“, which can be calculated in a time independent of the
length of the genetic sequences. The main rate-limiting step of the overall
procedure therefore lies either in the resampling of the Brownian path or
in the recalculation of the R matrix, depending on the exact model set-
tings. The ancestral sequences are refreshed regularly, conditional on the
current parameter conﬁguration. This update is the only one requiring
dynamic programming methods classically used for likelihood computa-
tion (Felsenstein, 1981).

The overall MCMC schedule is organized in long cycles, each starting
with a resampling of the ancestral sequences conditional on the current
parameter values, followed by a complex series of calls (of the order of
10 000 in total) to each of the update mechanisms described above and to
standard MetropolisiHastings updates of the global parameters of the
model (Lartillot and Poujol, 2011). A typical chain is run for 110(P5100
cycles, discarding the ﬁrst 100 cycles (burn-in). Convergence was checked
visually and then quantitatively assessed by estimating the discrepancy
between independent runs and the effective sample size associated to key
parameters of the model (in particular, the entries of the covariance
matrix). Typical effective sample sizes are of the order of 300 independent
points drawn from the posterior distribution for a nominal sample size
of 1000.

2.6 Data and simulations

Empirical data were gathered from several previous studies: a placental
nuclear dataset of 16 concatenated genes in 73 taxa (Lartillot and Delsuc,
2012), another placental nuclear dataset of 180 concatenated exons from
33 placental taxa (Lartillot, 2013b; Ranwez et al., 2007), a mitochondrial
dataset obtained by concatenating the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding
genes from 273 placental mammals (Nabholz et al., 2013), another similar
concatenation restricted to 201 Cetartiodactylia (Figuet et al., 2014) and
an alignment of ribosomal RNA sequences (only the stem regions) from
33 Archaea and an outgroup of 12 Eubacteria (Groussin and Gouy,
2011). In each case, the tree topology was obtained from the correspond-
ing publication and was used in all subsequent analyses.

Simulations were conducted using the placental nuclear dataset with
73 taxa as a template: a ﬁrst MCMC chain was run under the
time-heterogeneous model to estimate the global parameters of the
model (the divergence times, the diagonal matrix 20 used as a constant
parameter for the inverse Wishart prior, the nucleotide exchangeabilities,
the value of the substitution rate and the equilibrium GC composition at
the root of the tree). Simulation replicates were then produced condi-
tional on these parameter values, each time drawing a covariance
matrix, a Brownian history along the tree and a multiple sequence

alignment, and using P = 5000 to effectively approximate a true
Brownian motion. The Brownian process is here of dimension 3 (substi-
tution rate, equilibrium GC and one quantitative trait). True (simulated)
values of each of these components were set aside for later comparison,
and the resulting simulated data (the aligned sequences and the quanti-
tative trait) were used as an input for the MCMC sampler under various
model conﬁgurations.

3 RESULTS
3.1 MCMC mixing

Convergence and mixing of the MCMC is achieved across a wide
spectrum of discretization levels, ranging from P= 25 to
P = 1600 discretization points along the entire depth of the
tree, both under the time—homogeneous model (Table 1) and
the time—heterogeneous settings (Table 2). The time spent
per cycle of the MCMC is signiﬁcantly longer under the
time—heterogeneous than under the time—homogeneous model,
representing a 6—fold difference between the two settings. This
difference reﬂects the substantially more complex matrix compu—
tation implied by models where the substitution matrix itself, and

not just the overall substitution rate, is time—dependent (compare
Equations 2 and 3). Under both models, however, the time per
cycle is approximately linear in P, illustrating the linear complex—
ity of all of the algorithmic developments introduced here,
whether for proposing new Brownian paths or for recalculating
the likelihood once a new path has been proposed (see Section 2).

Acceptance rates remain stable across the entire range
for most proposals, except for ONEPATI—IMOVE and for
TIMEPATI—IMOVE, for which the acceptance rate declines as a f unc—
tion of the discretization level, albeit remaining sufﬁciently high
to provide good mixing even under the finest discretization
scheme. Note that acceptance rates given in Tables 1 and 2 are
given only for one reference value of the tuning parameter.
During the MCMC, a wider range of tuning parameters is
used, so as to cover the entire range of acceptance rates, from
10 to 90%. Finally, mixing rate, such as measured by the empir—
ical effective sample size, remains stable when measured per
cycle, decreasing somewhat for large P. Because time per cycle
increases linearly, the overall efﬁciency of the Monte Carlo sam—
pling procedure decreases approximately linearly in real time, as
a function of the discretization level P.

Importantly, LINEARBROWNIANSIGMAMOVE was essential for
obtaining good mixing. Without this proposal, mixing quickly
degrades as a function of the discretization level, to the point that
the Monte Carlo completely breaks down for more than P = 400
discretization points (not shown). The main rate—limiting aspects
causing this breakdown are discussed below.

3.2 Accuracy

Data simulated under a Brownian model were reanalyzed using
either the classical branchwise approximation (P = 1) or the ﬁne—
grained discretized Brownian model introduced here (P = 100).
Compared with the discretized Brownian implementation, the
branchwise approximation results in less accurate point estimates
of the instant substitution rate and the equilibrium GC content
at ancestral nodes of the phylogeny, with a root mean square
error (rmse) of 0.41 under P = 1 versus 0.36 under P = 100. The
reconstruction of the quantitative trait itself, on the other hand,
appears to be less affected by the branchwise approximation
(rmse of 0.32 versus 0.30). Similarly, the estimates of divergence
times appear to be robust to the specific approximation scheme
(rmse of 0.042 versus 0.039).

The inaccuracies at the level of the instantaneous values of the
substitution parameters result in inﬂated estimates of the corres—
ponding entries of the covariance matrix. Diagonal entries are
systematically overestimated (rmse = 1.26 versus 0.69).
Similarly, covariance parameters are inﬂated in absolute values
(rmse = 0.66 versus 0.29, Fig. 3). This bias is accompanied by a
greater uncertainty about the estimation of the variance and co—
variance parameters, by ~50% (Fig. 3). This error incurred on
the estimation of the covariance matrix can be explained by the
fact that the variance contributed at the levels of branch—speciﬁc
rates or substitution patterns by the randomness of the Brownian
paths, which is ignored under the branchwise approximation, is
absorbed by the values taken by the Brownian process at the
nodes of the phylogeny. This artifactually increased variance is
then naturally reﬂected in the estimated generator of the
Brownian process.

Of note, the accuracy was found to be nearly the same under
all values of P 3 25 explored here (between 25 and 200, Fig. 3),
suggesting that even moderate levels of discretization are sufﬁ—
cient to achieve good precision in the reconstruction of Brownian
substitution models.

3.3 Empirical data

The model was applied to a series of real datasets spanning
a broad range of taxon sampling and sequence length. The
time—heterogeneous model was used in all cases, leading to an
estimation of the correlation of the variation in substitution rate
(Table 3) and equilibrium GC content (Table 4) with a quanti—
tative trait (body mass in the case of mammals and optimal
growth temperature for the archaeal ribosomal RNA sequences).
The overall reconstructions obtained with P = 100 are globally
consistent with previously reported results on the same datasets.
In particular, substitution rate decreases with body mass in mam—
mals and with temperature in Archaea (Table 3). The relation
between equilibrium GC and body mass in mammals is esti—
mated to be negative in nuclear genomes but positive in mito—
chondrial genomes (Table 4), probably reﬂecting a biased gene
conversion effect in the nuclear case (Lartillot, 2013b; Romiguier
et al., 2010) and a body—size41ependent mutation bias in the
mitochondrial compartment (Nabholz et al., 2013). Finally, a
strong positive correlation between GC and growth temperature
is found in Archaea, possibly the result of an adaptative tuning
of RNA stem composition induced by thermodynamic stability
constraints (Galtier and Lobry, 1997; Groussin and Gouy, 2011).

These correlation patterns are globally robust to the choice of
the speciﬁc approximation scheme. On the other hand, some
differences in the quantitative results are present between the
branchwise (P = 1) and the ﬁne—grained (P = 100) approaches,
mirroring what was already observed on simulated data.
Globally, the branchwise approach leads to larger estimated co—
variance parameters. This additional dispersion in turn results in
weaker correlations. For instance, body size explains 36 versus

genomes in the case of the 33 taxon dataset. Similarly, growth
temperature explains R2 =61% of the variation in equilibrium
GC content in Archaea according to the discretized model,
versus R2=42% under the branchwise method. The use of
even a moderately fine—grained discretization scheme (typically
P = 100) therefore appears to result in a moderate gain in stat—
istical power for detecting and measuring correlations between
substitution patterns and quantitative traits.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this work, the details of an MCMC method for sampling fine—
grained discretizations of stochastic time—dependent substitution
models have been worked out and presented. While conﬁrming
earlier observations that the classical branchwise approximation
of Brownian substitution models gives qualitatively acceptable
results (Lartillot and Poujol, 2011), the present simulations
nevertheless suggest that a more ﬁne—grained computational ap—
proach leads to increased accuracy in the estimation of those
features of the model, ancestral rates and covariance matrix,
that are of more direct relevance in a comparative perspective.
As suggested by the application of this new framework to em—
pirical data, this increased accuracy results in a gain in statistical
power when assessing the strength of correlated variation in sub—
stitution patterns and quantitative traits along phylogenies.

Beyond these relatively modest short—term gains, the main
contribution of the present work is primarily algorithmic and
computational. Fundamentally, the present methodological
developments represent an important ﬁrst step toward a general
framework for addressing the speciﬁc challenges raised by
stochastic time—heterogenous substitution models. Ultimately,
the promising results obtained here on Brownian models open
the way to the implementation of a much wider class of stochas—
tic processes.

4.1 Fine-grained discretizations and MCMC

Among the specific challenges raised by ﬁne—grained time—
dependent substitution models, the most critical one encountered
in this work has been to obtain a MCMC whose mixing behavior
scales acceptably with the level of discretization of the model.
Even for a stochastic process as simple as a Brownian motion,
good MCMC update proposals that do not become extremely
inefficient for fine—grained discretization settings turn out to be
difficult to ﬁnd.

The fundamental reason behind this difﬁculty is that the
subset of model conﬁgurations signiﬁcantly contributing to the
posterior distribution, and which the MCMC should therefore
efﬁciently visit, is large in the absolute but small relative to the
space of all possible conﬁgurations. The data provide only lim—
ited constraint for determining which paths are acceptable, so
that the relative size of the subset of acceptable conﬁgurations
is primarily determined at the level of the Brownian process
itself. Technically, the Brownian process acts as a regularizer,
selecting only those paths that have globally consistent correl—
ation patterns (i.e. whose successive increments along the discret—
ization grid look all i.i.d. from the same multivariate normal
distribution). In the limit of large P, these paths are all in the
vicinity of a subspace of much lower dimension than the total
configuration space. In this regime, the proposed updates are
likely to be rejected, unless they are based on good prior guesses.

Practically, these fundamental limitations manifest themselves
in several indirect ways. First, while the data provide limited
information about the covariance matrix 2, and thus the mar—
ginal posterior on E is relatively broad, the conditional posterior
density on 2 given the current conﬁguration of the Brownian
process X, on the other hand, is highly peaked in the vicinity of
the empirical correlation matrix deﬁned by the current paths
across branches. As a result, resampling E conditional on
X and then X conditional on 2 becomes highly inefﬁcient
under fine—grained discretization.

Integrating out the covariance matrix, which is possible in the
present case because the inverse—Wishart is conjugate to the
normal distribution, does not really improve the situation for
the following reason: the independent Brownian paths instan—
tiated over distinct branches still have to match in their correl—
ation patterns, to be jointly considered as acceptable under any
given covariance matrix. Thus, updating one branch—speciﬁc
path at a time, conditional on all other paths, while important
for mixing paths under the current correlation structure, will not
result in a good mixing across correlation structures. This sug—
gests that the only possibility to mix over the correlation struc—
ture of the Brownian process is to update all paths
simultaneously. Even in that case, however, the update will be

accepted only if the ﬁnal paths are all typical Brownian—looking
paths, all with similar empirical correlation structures, which is
what LINEARBROWNIANSIGMAMOVE is meant to achieve.

All these difﬁculties are certainly not speciﬁc to Brownian
models. Instead, they merely betray a more fundamental curse
of dimensionality inherent to the project of implementing ﬁne—
grained implementations of doubly stochastic substitution
models. On the other hand, the solutions proposed here, while
not totally satisfactory (some of the MCMC updates used here
do seem to ultimately fail for sufﬁciently fine—grained discret—
ization schemes, see Table 1 and 2), are good enough for reason—
ably large values of P. In addition, they should generalize well to
other types of processes.

Other speciﬁc challenges are also worth mentioning. In par—
ticular, alternative discretization schemes have been explored but
did not prove robust in the face of the other constraints of the
model. Branchwise discretization schemes, for instance, in which
each branch is subdivided into segments of equal size, were not
found to be satisfactory, raising problems of consistency of the
overall approximation procedure or inducing non—local changes
when divergence times are modiﬁed. The global discretization
grid developed here, in contrast, is globally consistent and
allows for local—only proposals, which can then be ﬂexibly
tuned to target any desired acceptance rate. It should also be
noted that the solution developed here could easily be general—
ized to proposals that would modify the topology of the tree.
Paths would then be resampled in the neighborhood of the prun—
ing and the regrafting points, directly from the distribution
defined by the stochastic process and conditional on the end
points.

The main computational bottleneck under time—heterogeneous
models is the calculation of the matrix giving the substitution
probabilities across branches (Equation 3). Currently, this rate—
limiting step is still prohibitive for larger state spaces, such as
implied in particular by codon models. On the other hand, given
that the underlying algorithmics entirely consists of iterated
series of matriximatrix products, all of identical dimensions,
standard vectorization or parallelization methods could certainly
be recruited here. In its current form, the present program typ—
ically allows for comparative analyses using datasets with up to a
few hundred taxa and a few hundred thousand aligned positions
(Tables 3 and 4), achieving effective sample sizes of 10(L300 after
a few days of computation on a single core, reaching up to one or
two weeks for the largest datasets and under time—heterogeneous
models (180h for the placental mitochondrial dataset, 273 taxa).

4.2 Long-term applications

Beyond the specific case of Brownian models, the approach
introduced here delineates a general framework for developing
ﬁne—grained implementations of a large spectrum of time—
dependent substitution models. In principle, it could easily be
adapted to more general Gaussian processes, such as the
OrnsteiniUhlenbeck process (Hansen, 1997), or to other more
complex models such as Levy processes (Landis et al., 2013).
In fact, the main properties of the process used here for
developing path sampling algorithms (see Section 2) are (i) the
Markov property, (ii) the possibility of efﬁciently calculating and
sampling from conditional ﬁnite—time probability distributions

and (iii) the possibility of applying a joint transformation to
the paths and the generator of the process that leaves the prior
invariant. Most Markovian stochastic processes used in the com—
parative method today meet these requirements and could there—
fore now be recruited as alternative models for the evolution of
the substitution rate or any other parameter of the substitution
process.

On the other hand, by relying on a ﬁxed discretization grid, the
current approach may possibly not be ideal for processes that
make rare but large jumps at arbitrary time points. Although the
approximation would still be controlled with an error propor—
tional to (St even in the presence of jumps, for the sake of accur—
acy, it might be more convenient to adapt the sampling grid so as
to match the actual positions of the jumps. In this direction,
compound Poisson processes (Huelsenbeck et al., 2000) could
represent a promising avenue of research.

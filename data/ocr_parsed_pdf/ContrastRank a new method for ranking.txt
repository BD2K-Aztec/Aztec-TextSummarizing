ContrastRank

 

Genome Project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) and
TCGA normal samples. ContrastRank can assign a score to each
genome, which can discriminate normal from the tumor samples
and amongst different tumor types. We tested the method
on three whole—exome sequencing data of adenocarcinomas
from TCGA. Our method performs highly in discriminating
normal from tumor samples, as well as, different types of
adenocarcinomas.

2 METHODS

2.1 Deﬁnitions and assumptions

We assume that rare variants are more likely to have functional effect
than common variants and among the rare variants the non-synonymous
single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) have the strongest impact. This as-
sumption is supported by the analysis of annotated variants in dbSNP
(Sherry et al., 2001), which shows that the fraction of annotated patho-
genic variants is signiﬁcantly higher for nsSNVs (Supplementary Fig.
SlA). Moreover, among the nsSNVs, the rare ones harbor signiﬁcantly
higher fraction of deleterious variants (Supplementary Fig. SlB). Thus,
we deﬁne a putative deleterious variant (PDV) as the nsSNV with allele
frequency <0.5%. This frequency threshold for filtering nsSNVs has been
recently used to estimate genomic regions under purifying selection
(Khurana et al., 2013). We also deﬁne putative impaired genes (PIGs)
as those genes that carry at least one PDV. For each gene in a set of
samples, we can calculate its putative defective rate (PDR) as the fraction
of samples in which a given gene carries at least one PDV.

2.2 Datasets

We used three datasets of whole-exome sequence made available by
TCGA consortium. We selected three types of adenocarcinomas for
which there are >200 pairs of normal/tumor samples that we consider
to be the minimum number of samples to perform a 2-fold cross-valid-
ation test. For each tumor type, we selected the largest datasets of sam-
ples for colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) produced by the Baylor College
of Medicine and lung and prostate adenocarcinomas (LUAD and
PRAD, respectively) produced by the Broad Institute of MIT and
Harvard. The three selected datasets are composed by 220, 625 and 309
matching pairs of normal and tumor samples from patients respectively
affected by COAD, LUAD and PRAD.

We also analyzed the genomes of 1092 individuals made available by
the 1000 Genomes Consortium. (ftp: //ftp-trace.ncbi.nih .gov/ 1 000genomes/
ftp/release/20110521). In our analysis, the variation data from eight
genes in the chromosome Y were not considered because of the lower
number of individuals for which the data are available and missing
genotype data for some of the alleles in the samples. We used
ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010) to annotate the effect of the genetic
variants in each VCF ﬁle from TCGA and 1000 genomes using the
human genome build 19 (hg19).

For tumor datasets speciﬁc ﬁltering procedures have been adopted to
extract the genetic variants from the Variant Calling Format (VCF) ﬁles
(Supplementary Methods 1). The ﬁltering procedure applied to COAD,
LUAD and PRAD samples allowed us to select an average number of
nsSNVs per sample that is comparable with the recently estimated value
(~10000) (Bamshad et al., 2011). Average values of nsSNVs for the
normal and tumor samples in COAD, LUAD, PRAD and 1000
Genomes samples are reported in Supplementary Table S1.

In our analysis, we only focus on PDVs with minor allele frequency
(MAF) <0.5%. The MAF is derived from the genomes of 1092 individ-
uals in 1000 Genomes Consortium. All the nsSNVs found in TCGA
samples, but not in 1000 Genomes, were considered to have even lower
frequencies, and therefore, assumed to be PDVs.

After ﬁltering, the number of PDVs in normal and tumor samples is
between 1(P16% of the whole set of nsSNVs. The average number of
PDVs per individual in 1000 Genome is 318. This is in agreement with the
previous published result (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al.,
2012). We mapped all the PDVs to their corresponding genes and calcu-
lated the average number of FIGS for each sample. We found that on
average the PDVs are affecting ~700 and 900 PIGs in normal and tumor
samples, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The distributions of the
nsSNVs and PDVs across different samples of the three tumor types are
shown in Supplementary Figure S2. In addition, a ﬂow chart summariz-
ing the procedure used for preprocessing our datasets is provided in
Supplementary Figure S3.

2.3 Gene prioritization score

To discriminate between cancer and normal samples, we adopted a gene
prioritization approach based on the analysis of FIGS in normal and
tumor subsets. The basic idea behind our statistical approach is that
the lower the probability of observing a gene mutated in multiple
normal samples the higher the probability of it being a cancer driver
gene, when frequently mutated in tumor samples. We estimated the prob-
ability of a gene g of being classiﬁed k times as a PIG in a set of N tumor
samples using a binomial distribution,

N1

bg(k, N, TI): 

71:0 — 7150M" (1)
where, 71,; is the probability of having at least one PDV on the gene g.
Therefore, the probability Pg of observing X mutated samples where gene
g is potentially impaired and with X z k is as follows:

A71 A71
. N! . ,1.
Pg(XZ/(,N,JT)=1—§ bg(1,N,JI)=l —§ mega—71g)”
i=0 i=0 ' '

(2)

where k>0. Using this modiﬁed version of the cumulative distribution,
we can estimate the probability that a gene g is k or more times classiﬁed
as a PIG on our dataset.

The missing variable for the estimation of Pg is the probability of
having at least one PDV in gene g (71g). In our approach, we derived
this parameter from the analysis of the occurrence of FIGS in TCGA
normal and 1000 Genomes samples. Assuming that rare PDVs have
strong functional impact with respect to other types of variants, we
classify a gene as a PIG only if it contains at least one PDV with
MAF 5 0.5% in 1000 Genomes (Khurana et al., 2013). Therefore,
given a set of samples I = {11,12, . . . .IN}, where N is the total number
of samples, the probability 71,; can be estimated by calculating the PDR of
the gene g in the dataset I composed by N samples. In our analysis, we
deﬁned 71,; as the maximum PDR value for the gene g in TCGA normal
and 1000 Genomes samples. We consider this value as the background
PDR of each gene.

The 71,; values described above allow us to calculate the probability Pg
that each gene g is classiﬁed as a PIG in k or more genomes in a given set
of tumor samples. We derive a ﬁnal score for each gene as follows:

Sg = — 10g 10Pg 

In the case, where a gene does not harbor any PDV neither in normal
TCGA nor in 1000 Genomes samples, an arbitrary PDR of 5 X 104 is
assigned to this gene. This smoothing of probability is about half of the
probability that could be observed by Laplace correction (add one when a
value is missing) in 1000 Genomes (1/1092).

2.4 Exome scoring method

We used the gene scores described above to discriminate between normal
and tumor samples. For each genome, we extracted the list of M putative
impaired genes (PIGs) G = {g,,g2, . . . .. ,gM} with at least one PDV with

 

i573

allele frequency <0.5% in 1000 Genomes and calculated the average score
S as follows:

M

1 M 1
s: Mgsg, = E; —log10P ,. (4)

where Pg and sg are deﬁned in Equations (2) and (3).

2.5 Benchmarking

To verify the quality of the prioritization score implemented in
ContastRank, we compared our results with that of MutSigCV
(Lawrence et al., 2013). For this comparison, we assumed three manually
curated lists, namely Bushman (Bushman, 2013), COSMIC Census
(Forbes et al., 201 1) and Vogelstein (Vogelstein et al., 2013) as true positive
cancer-related genes (Supplementary Methods 2.1).

We tested the performance of our method (ContrastRank) for its abil-
ity to discriminate between normal and tumor samples. We used a simple
binary classiﬁer based on the score threshold to separate normal from
tumor samples. To test ContastRank, we used a 2-fold cross-validation
procedure that maximizes the level of variability among different training
sets. The performance of our method has been compared with those of
the two alternative approaches namely ContastLow and ContastDiff (see
Supplementary Methods 2.3). Finally, we also tested the ability of
ContastRank approach to discriminate between the three different
tumor types considered in this paper (COAD, LUAD and PRAD).

A detailed description of the methods, the benchmark procedures and
the deﬁnitions the standard performance measures used in this work are
reported in Sections 2 and 3 of the Supplementary Methods.

3 RESULTS

In this paper, we describe ContrastRank, a method that relies on
the analysis of PIGs in the TCGA normal and cancer samples for
prioritizing potential cancer driver genes.

For each gene in each cancer type (COAD, LUAD and
PRAD), we calculated probabilistic scores that allow us to dis—
criminate TCGA normal from tumor samples. In the following
sections, we described the results of our analysis of three TCGA
adenocarcinoma datasets and the performance of ContrastRank
algorithm on each tumor type.

3.1 Analysis of TCGA samples and gene prioritization

3.1.] Analysis of the cancer prioritization lists The COAD data—
set is composed of 220 normalitumor pairs. After extracting the
PDVs from all the samples, we identiﬁed on average 996 and
1276 PDVs in normal and tumor samples, respectively. These
variants correspond to an average value of 643 and 880 PIGs
for normal and tumor genomes. Analyzing the occurrence of
PDVs in the normal samples, we found 14449 genes with at
least one PDV, 50% of which have 33 PDVs. This corresponds
to an average PDR of 1.4%. In the cancer samples, we observed
17006 genes with at least one PDV and a median value of 5
PDVs for each gene and an average PDR of 2.3%. By calculat—
ing the distributions of all the PDRs in our datasets, the percent—
age of genes with PDR§0.05 are about 95, 92 and 82%,
respectively, for 1000 Genomes, TCGA normal and tumor sam—
ples (Supplementary Fig. 84A).

The LUAD dataset is composed of 625 normalitumor pairs.
The average PDVs are 1202 and 1599 PDVs in normal and
tumor samples, respectively which affect on average 751 and
1041 PIGs. In the whole LUAD dataset, we found 16891

PIGs of which half with 33 PDVs and an average PDR of
1.1%. In the cancer samples, there are 18213 PIGs with a
median value of 14 PDVs and an average PDR of 2.2%.
Finally, the percentages of PIGs with PDR§0.05 are about
96, 91 and 81% respectively for 1000 Genomes, TCGA normal
and tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. S4B).

Similar results are observed for the PRAD dataset, which is
composed of 309 normalitumor sample pairs. On average we
found 1321 and 1540 PDVs respectively in normal and tumor
genomes, which correspond to 819 and 953 PIGs. In the whole
set of normal samples, there are 15 457 PIGs 50% of which with
34 PDVs, and average PDR of 1.3%. In the cancer samples, in
total we observed 16765 PIGs with a median value of 6 PDVs
for each PIG and an average PDR of 1.9%. In the case of
PRAD, the percentage of PIGs with PDR g 0.05 are about 95,
88 and 84% respectively for 1000 Genomes, TCGA normal and
tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. S4C).

3.1.2 Cancer gene prioritization scores In the next step, we used
the PDRs, to prioritize PIGs for each tumor type. We report in
Figure 1 a scatter plot representing for each PIG the background
PDR on the x—axis (maximum PDR between TCGA normal and
1000 Genomes samples) and the PDR in tumor samples on the y—
axis. The points closer to the diagonal have low score because the
background PDR and the tumor PDR are similar. Genes with
higher impact correspond to the darker points, which are far
from the diagonal. In COAD samples, KRAS and T P53 on aver—
age have at least one PDV in 48 tumor samples out of 110.
Accordingly, these highly scored genes, are almost overlapping,
showing PDR values of ~0.44 in tumor samples and ~0.01 as
background (Fig. 1A). For LUAD, the top genes GAGEZA and
KRAS have PDR values of 0.66 and 0.29, respectively (Fig. 1B).

These values are signiﬁcantly higher than the background
PDR (~0.01). GAGEZA is also the highest scoring gene in
PRAD (Fig. 1C), with at least one PDV in 65 tumor samples
out of 110. This corresponds to a PDR of 0.59 in tumor samples,
which is significantly higher than the background PDR (0.02).
On average, CLEC4M has been observed to be a PIG respect—
ively in 12 and 57 normal and tumor samples over 110. This
difference makes CLEC4M the second highest ranked gene for
PRAD.

To take into account the possible variability in terms of PDVs
across different samples, we analyzed the 10 bootstap samples
composed of 110 pairs of cancer and normal samples. This
number of pairs corresponds to half the size of the smallest
cohort (COAD) among our TCGA datasets. For each one of
the subsets, we calculated the PDR of each PIG in tumor sam—
ples and compared it against the background PDR value (max—
imum PDR value observed in TCGA normal and 1000 Genomes
samples). Using the equations in Section 2.3, we were able to
assign to each gene a logarithmic score that represents its prob—
ability of being a PIG in k samples over a set of N tumor sam—
ples. The final score calculated for each PIG is the average value
of the results obtained on the 10 sampling experiments.
Performing this analysis we found 139, 318 and 96 genes with
scores larger than 3 for COAD, LUAD and PRAD, respectively.
The ﬁrst four high—ranking genes for COAD are KRAS, T P53,
PIK3CA and BRAF. For LUAD, the highest scoring genes are
GAGE2A, KRAS, CT45A6 and TP53. For PRAD, these genes

acy; PPV and NPV, positive and negative predicted values; TPR and TNR, true

ContrastRank reached an overall accuracy of 94% (correlation
0.88 and AUC 0.98). When compared with ContrastDiff, these
were 5% higher overall accuracy, 0.1 higher correlation and 0.03
higher AUC. The performance of ContrastLow is reported in
Supplementary Figure S6B. When a score threshold of 3 was
used for selecting highly ranked genes, we found 494 high scoring
PIGs. Using PIGs with score >3, ContrastRank performed at
97% overall accuracy with correlation coefﬁcient 0.93 and AUC
0.99 (Table 2).

Finally, in the case of PRAD, we performed 2—fold cross—val—
idation procedure randomly selecting normal/tumor samples
from a cohort of 309 matching pairs. Similar to LUAD, also
for PRAD the highest scored PIG was GAGE2A. Using only
the ﬁrst ranking gene ContrastRank reached 78% overall accur—
acy with 0.61 correlation and 0.78 AUC. In comparison with
ContrastDiff, the performance of ContrastRank began to be sig—
niﬁcantly better after selecting the first 30 highest—ranking PIGs
(Supplementary Fig. S7 panels A and C). In that case,
ContrastRank reached 90% overall accuracy with 0.81 correl—
ation and 0.96 AUC. Compared with ContrastDiff, these values
were of 6% higher overall accuracy, 0.13 higher correlation and
0.04 better AUC. When removing the first 1000 highly scored
genes (~6%), the performance of ContrastLow dropped down
to 0.54 overall accuracy, 0.09 correlation and 0.52 AUC
(Supplementary Fig. S7B). Using PIGs with score higher than
3, ContrastRank method resulted in 91% overall accuracy with
0.83 correlation coefﬁcient and 0.97 AUC (Table 1).

3.2.2 Performances with unrelated normal samples To estimate
the lower bound performance of ContrastRank in the discrimin—
ation between normal and tumor samples, we tested our method
using a 2—fold cross—validation approach (CV Unseen) where the
normal samples are swapped between the two subsets
(Supplementary Methods 2.2). With this procedure, none of
the normal samples in one subset were from the same patient
as the tumor samples. The results in Supplementary Table S3
show an average decrease of the overall accuracy from 245%
and 146% in AUC with respect to the standard cross—validation

COAD 0.98 0.97 0.99 0.99 0.97 0.96 0.99 107/128

procedure (CV Identiﬁer). The decrease of performance is
inversely proportional to the number of samples of each
tumor type.

3.3 Discriminating adenocarcinomas samples

We evaluated the ability of ContrastRank to discriminate tumor
samples from different types of adenocarcinomas. For this pur—
pose, we built three dataset containing 50% of the samples from
the tumor type under study (positive cases) and the other 50%
equally divided between the two remaining tumor types (negative
cases). Next, we calculated the score associated with each PIG in
both the halves of the dataset. We used the difference between
the scores obtained for the subset of positive cases (adenocarcin—
oma under study) and negative cases (mixture of the other two
tumor types). According to this definition, we had highly positive
scores that correspond to genes with high PDR, signiﬁcantly
higher in tumor type under study, and negative scores, which
are associated to genes with high PDR in remaining tumor types.

We used both set of genes in our classiﬁcation scheme and
calculated the performance for each tumor types. We first
analyzed the scheme to discriminate COAD from the other
two tumor types (LUAD and PRAD). The gene with observed
highest score for COAD were T P53 and KRAS, and the lowest
negative scores were for C T 45A6 and GAGE2A. This is in agree—
ment with the previous results where KRAS and T P53 were
highly ranked gene for discrimination of COAD tumors from
normal samples. On the other hand, GAGEZA and C T 45A6 were
highly scored genes for LUAD and PRAD.

When discriminating LUAD samples from the others, the
highest positively discriminating genes were GAGEZA and
C T 45A6 and highest negatively discriminating genes were
PIK3CA and SPOP. Interestingly, KRAS, a high scoring PIG
in LUAD, was not a high scoring discriminator because it is
highly scored in a negative tumor type, namely COAD. In con—
trast, PIK3CA, a gene with low PDR in LUAD, became a strong
negative discriminator because of its high PDR in a negative
case, again COAD. Finally, for PRAD, the highest positive dis—
criminators were GAGEZA and CLEC4M and the highest nega—
tive discriminators were KRAS and T P53. These data were in
agreement with the previous results on PRAD dataset that as—
signed high PDR scores to GAGEZA and CLEC4M. The lowest
negative discriminating scores assigned to KRAS and T P53 were
justiﬁed because of their being among the top four PIGs for the

ContrastRank

 

negative cases, i.e. COAD and LUAD. The discrimination scores
used in these tests are reported in the Supplementary Files.

To prove the ability of our procedure based on the difference
of scores obtained with the ContrastRank method, we evaluated
the accuracy of a binary classiﬁer able to discriminate between
the tumor under study and the remaining types. The perform—
ances were calculated considering an increasing number of highly
discriminative PIGs. Because in the new scoring scale negative
scores are present, we included in the list of selected PIGs an
equal numbers of highest positive and lowest negative scoring
genes. In Supplementary Figure S8 we report the average values
of the main accuracy measures (Q2, C and AUC) for each tumor
type. At first sight, it is possible to notice that LUAD is the most
difficult tumor to distinguish from the other types. This obser—
vation is conﬁrmed by the results in Table 2 where we report the
accuracy of our ContrastRank method using PIG genes with
scores higher than 3 and lower than 73. With this cutoff score,
COAD tumor samples could be discriminated with an overall
accuracy of 98% (correlation 0.96 and AUC 0.99) using an aver—
age number of 107 top positive and 128 lowest negative genes.
With the same threshold the performance on LUAD samples
was the poorest, reaching 77% overall accuracy (correlation
0.55 and AUC 0.83) using an average number of 274 positively
and 28 negatively scored genes. In the case of PRAD, the method
showed an intermediate level of accuracy, reaching 84% (correl—
ation 0.69 and AUC 0.89) using on average number of 59 top
and 199 lowest ranking genes.

4 DISCUSSION

Accurate variant calling and appropriate filtering procedures are
important prerequisites for the analysis of whole—exome sequen—
cing data. Although alternative variant calling procedures can
result in different number of variants, the consistency of our
datasets composition (Supplementary Table $1), in terms of
total SNVs, PDVs and PIGs, makes us conﬁdent about the aver—
age quality of nsSNVs used in our analysis. This is also con—
ﬁrmed by similar distributions of PDVs and nsSNVs in each
sample (Supplementary Fig. S2). The general idea of using rare
nsSNVs is supported by the analysis of variants annotated in
dbSNP (Supplementary Fig. Sl) Furthermore, the selection of
0.5% as a threshold for deﬁning PDVs is consistent with previ—
ously large—scale analysis of human genetic variants (Khurana
et al., 2013). The analysis of selected PDVs and the distribution
of PDRs for PIGs in each dataset (1000 Genomes, TCGA
normal and tumor samples) shows an increasing percentage of
PIGs with PDR>0.05 from 1000 Genomes to TCGA tumor
samples (Supplementary Fig. S4). On average, for the three
tumor types (COAD, LUAD and PRAD), the number of
PIGs with PDRs>0.05 are 4.5, 9.5 and 17.7% in 1000
Genomes, TCGA normal and tumor samples, respectively.
This observation is in agreement with the idea that samples for
normal tissues in patients affected by cancer can contain a high
rate of putative functionally deleterious variants than samples
from healthy individuals.

ConstrastRank allows us to prioritize possible cancer driver
genes. We ﬁrst compared the performance of ContrastRank
against MutSigCV using three different manually curated lists
of cancer—related genes, namely Bushman, COSMIC Census

and Vogelstein (see Section 2.5). Although a real evaluation of
the performance is still a difﬁcult task in absence of a true bench—
mark set, ContrastRank performs better than MutSigCV for all
three tumor types under study (Supplementary Fig. SS and
Supplementary Table S2).

Looking at ContrastRank results, for COAD, we ﬁnd 139
genes with ContrastRank with average score >3. Comparing
these genes with the Bushman, COSMIC Census and
Vogelstein gene lists we found between 11 and 27% possible
cancer—causing genes in common (Supplementary Table S4).
Using the Fisher’s exact test to compare the number of onco—
genes in highly ranked PIGs and the number of oncogenes over
the remaining genes, we found P—values lower than 10’7 for all
the benchmark sets. In addition, we found that eight of our
highly ranked genes are included in the list of 11 high signiﬁ—
cantly mutated colorectal cancer genes provided by Broad
Institute (http://cancergenome.broadinstitute.org/). The same
analysis on LUAD dataset detected 319 PIGs, between 5 to
15% of which are in the three cancer gene lists. Comparing the
fraction of oncogene in the highly ranked genes against the
number of oncogenes on the remaining genes, we found a sig—
niﬁcant P—value lower than 0.01. Comparing our list of LUAD
genes with score >3 with the list provided by Broad Institute, we
found 11 common genes over 14. Similar results are obtained for
prostate cancer for which we found a total number of 96 highly
scored genes, 5 to 19% of which are also in the benchmark lists
of cancer—related genes. Also in this case, the comparison of the
distributions of cancer genes in low and high scored subset re—
sulted in Fisher’s exact test P—values lower than 0.01. In the case
of PRAD, the Broad Institute only reports one gene that is also
included in the list of our highly scored genes. All the numbers
about the comparison between the gene lists obtained using
ContrastRank and those in Bushman, COSMIC Census
and Vogelstein gene lists are summarized in Supplementary
Table S4.

We showed that ContrastRank scores could discriminate
TCGA normal from tumor samples, as well as different types
of adenocarcinomas from each other. Using genes with score
higher than 3, we showed that our approach could discriminate
tumor from normal samples with an overall accuracy >90% and
AUC >0.95 for each tumor type (see Table 1). Good levels of
performances are also obtained in a more stringent test (CV
Unseen) in which the normal and tumor samples with same
identiﬁer were kept disjoint (Supplementary Table S3).
Furthermore, the difference of ContrastRank scores could dis—
criminate different tumor types. Using a cutoff score of 3, the
results show that in the worst case (LUAD), our method reaches
an average overall accuracy of 77% and AUC 0.83. Better per—
formances are obtained for PRAD and COAD (Table 2). These
results are in agreement with the analysis of highly scored genes
for each tumor type. Using common size datasets composed by
220 samples equally distributed between positive and negative
cases, we found 139, 318 and 96 high scored genes (average
score>3) for COAD, LUAD and PRAD, respectively.
Comparing these lists of genes we found that 75 and 40% of
highly scored PIGs in PRAD and COAD respectively are over—
lapping with highly scored genes in LUAD (Fig. 2). In this scen—
ario, LUAD seems to involve a larger spectrum of PIGs with
respect to COAD and PRAD. The observed heterogeneity could

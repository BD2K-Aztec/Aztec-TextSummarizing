ABSTRACT

Motivation: Membrane proteins are clinically relevant, yet their crystal
structures are rare. Models of membrane proteins are typically built
from template structures with low sequence identity to the target se-
quence, using a sequence-structure alignment as a blueprint. This
alignment is usually made with programs designed for use on soluble
proteins. Biological membranes have layers of varying hydrophobicity,
and membrane proteins have different amino-acid substitution prefer-
ences from their soluble counterparts. Here we include these factors
into an alignment method to improve alignments and consequently
improve membrane protein models.

Results: We developed Membrane Protein Threader (MP-T), a
sequence-structure alignment tool for membrane proteins based on
multiple sequence alignment. Alignment accuracy is tested against
seven other alignment methods over 165 non-redundant alignments
of membrane proteins. MP-T produces more accurate alignments
than all other methods tested (SFM from +0.9 to +55%). Alignments
generated by MP-T also lead to significantly better models than those
of the best alternative alignment tool (one-fourth of models see an
increase in GDT_TS of 34%).

1 INTRODUCTION

There are only ~350 unique membrane protein crystal structures
(http://www.blanco.biomol.uci.edu/mpstruc). For comparison,
in July 2012 there were >45 000 unique crystal structures in the
Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000). This disparity is not
due to importance: the location of membrane proteins on the
surface of cells and their involvement in signalling pathways
make them targets for approximately one-half of current and
future drugs (Overington et al., 2006). The disparity arises be-
cause membrane proteins are inherently hard to crystallizeithe
hydrophilic conditions required for crystallization are often in-
compatible with the hydrophobic conditions in which a mem-
brane protein assumes its native structure.

In the absence of crystal structures, a model of a target
sequence may be built using as a template a related protein of

known structure (homology modelling). Conceptually, homology
modelling can be divided into three phases: (i) identifying a tem-
plate (‘fold recognition’), (ii) aligning the residues of the target
on to the template structure, (iii) completion of the model impli-
cit from this alignment (e.g. by modelling missing loops). Many
methods perform fold-recognition and alignment simultan-
eously. In this work, we maintain a distinction and focus solely
on alignment.

Alignment methods differ in how they use information about
protein structure and sequence. Sequence information is derived
from a set of sequences that are homologous to the target and
template. These sequences are often combined into a profile.
Structure information is commonly incorporated either by the
use of statistical potentials (e. g. Yang et al., 2011) or by annota-
tion of the template sequence, e.g. with secondary structure
strings (Shi et al., 2001).

The alignment of membrane proteins presents unique chal-
lenges. Most soluble proteins are globular with a hydrophilic
surface, whereas membrane proteins possess neither of these
properties. Alignment methods incorporating statistical poten-
tials derived from soluble proteins are thus expected to perform
poorly on membrane proteins. At least two such methods,
pGenThreader (Lobley et al., 2009) and SPARKS-X Wang
et al., 2011), recognize this and ﬁlter transmembrane sections
from their results.

Alignment methods that annotate a template include
HHsearch (deing, 2005) and PROMALS (Pei and Grishin,
2007). These align pairs of proﬁles that are annotated with sec-
ondary structure strings. PROMALS may also be used as a
homology-extension method. In this approach, a multiple se-
quence alignment (MSA) is performed, but with each sequence
replaced by a proﬁle.

Most MSA methods, such as MAFFT (Katoh and Toh,
2008), MSAProbs (Liu et al., 2010) and T-Coffee (Notredame
et al., 2000) do not use any structure information, but instead
derive their accuracy from a ‘consistency’ criterion and/ or itera-
tive optimization. Consistency-based approaches aim to generate
a MSA that accords best with a library of pairwise alignments
between the sequences being aligned.

A small number of alignment methods have been designed
speciﬁcally for membrane proteins. The AlignMe program has
been developed to study LeuT-fold transporters (Khafizov et al.,
2010). PralineTM (Pirovano et al., 2008) and TM-Coffee (Chang
et al., 2012) are homology-extension (multiple proﬁle alignment)
methods that have been found to perform well on alignments of
transmembrane proteins from the BALiBASE benchmark.
Neither method uses secondary structure to aid alignment, but

MP-T

 

PralineTM uses different scoring in regions annotated as being
transmembrane.

Owing to the scarcity of known structures, the best template
for a membrane protein sequence is likely to have extremely low
sequence identityipotentially beneath the ~30% ‘twilight zone’.
Fortunately, even at this low level of sequence identity, accurate
alignment may be possible, as biological membranes have a sand-
wich structure with a hydrophobic middle (lipid tail layer)
and hydrophilic edges (lipid head layer). These differing hydro-
phobicities constrain the amino acids likely to be found in each
environment (Forrest et al., 2006).

In previous work, we demonstrated that environment-speciﬁc
substitution tables improved the pairwise alignment of mem-
brane proteins (Hill et al., 2011). Here, we incorporate these
tables into a consistency-based MSA program, Membrane
Protein Threader (MP-T). The evolutionary information pro-
vided by homologous sequences greatly increases alignment ac-
curacy at low sequence identities compared with pairwise
alignments.

Our approach involves no sequence weighting or iterative
refinement, and yet it is as accurate as leading profileiprofile
aligners such as HHsearch (Soding, 2005) and PROMALS
(Pei and Grishin, 2007) while introducing fewer misaligned
pairs of residues. MP—T leads to models with signiﬁcantly
higher GDT_TS (Zemla et al., 2001) than the best alternative
alignment method testedione-fourth of models see an increase
in GDT_TS of at least 4%.

2 APPROACH

We develop MP—T, a progressive multiple alignment method
speciﬁcally for use on membrane protein sequences. Sequences
homologous to the target and template are collected and used to
construct a phylogenetic ‘guide’ tree. The sequences are then
aligned in the order dictated by the branching of the tree, work-
ing from the leaves and aligning towards the root.

In previous work, we performed pairwise alignment of a se-
quence on to a template (Hill et al., 2011). Our pairwise align-
ment method used structural information by annotating residues
in the template with the region of the membrane that they con-
tacted, their secondary structure type and their accessible surface
area. Different scoring systems were used for each combination
of annotations (hereafter termed an ‘environment’) and gap
penalties were also varied with environment as, for example, a
gap is unlikely to be opened in the middle of a transmembrane
helix.

This pairwise method cannot be translated directly into a
MSA method as only one sequenceithe templateihas the
structural annotation required for accurate alignments. To
remedy this, pairwise alignments are made between the template
sequence and each homologue, and structural annotation is
transferred between aligned pairs of residues. After annotation
transfer, a guide tree is constructed and used to select homo-
logues for the multiple-alignment phase: only sequences judged
by the guide tree to be descendants of the most recent common
ancestor of the target and template are selected. Multiple-
alignment then proceeds using our implementation of the
T-Coffee objective criterion (Notredame et al., 2000).
The criterion requires a library of pairwise alignments, which

we construct by applying our pairwise alignment method to all
pairs of selected homologues.

The above-outlined approach merges our accurate pairwise
aligner into a consistency-based membrane multiple sequence
aligner. The approach uses phylogeny to exclude spurious hom-
ology information from the alignment.

3 METHODS

3.1 Scoring system of our method

Our approach requires each template to be annotated with environment
information. To do this we used iMembrane (Kelm et al., 2009), which
determines membrane positioning based on coarse-grained molecular-
dynamics simulations available in the CGDB database (Scott et al., 2008).

Substitution tables were built for each environment by counting sub-
stitutions between 416 annotated structures and a large number of
sequence homologues in a process analogous to that used in the construc-
tion of BLOSUM matrices (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). MAFFT
L-INS-i (Katoh and Toh, 2008) was used to align each structure with
its homologues. In contrast to our previous work, substitutions for an
environment were counted symmetrically, e. g. a substitution from alanine
in a helix structure to glycine in a sequence Ahab, —> Gseqmm, implies a
substitution GhelL-x —> Asequeme even though the glycine could potentially
not be in a helix. This change ensures consistency with our transfer of
environment annotations (see Section 2) between the template and each
sequence. The substitution tables used here are available at http://www.
stats.ox.ac.uk/proteins/resources.

During multiple sequence alignment, no gap penalties were imposed
other than a terminal gap penalty of —S. In constructing the pairwise
library, a terminal gap penalty of —50 was used in addition to four pairs
of afﬁne gap penalties that depended on whether a gap occurred in the
tail layer of the membrane or in a region of known secondary structure.
For gaps in the tail layer disrupting secondary structure, gape”: —360,
gm: —60; for other gaps in the tail layer, gape”: —220, gm: —20; for
other gaps disrupting secondary structure, gape”: —300, gm: —20; all
other gaps, gape”: —200, gm: —10. Gap penalty values were
non-exhaustively optimized on the 72 pairwise alignments in Hill et a].
(2011), by testing perturbations around plausible values. Gap penalties
are most severe in transmembrane regions and in secondary structure
elements. This agrees with the high conservation of secondary structure
elements, and with the fact that transmembrane elements are constrained
to be at least the width of the membrane.

3.2 Construction of training and test sets

Sequences were extracted from proteins with PDB codes accessible at the
Membrane Proteins of Known 3D Structures Database on 10 January
2012. The sequences were ordered as follows:

(1) Sequences that formed the gap-penalty training set
(2) Sequences present in the CGDB molecular dynamics database
(3) Sequences from X-ray structures (sorted by resolution)

(4) Sequences from NMR structures

As the list of sequences was traversed in the above order, a sequence
was ‘accepted’ if it had <60% sequence identity [as determined by a
TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) structural alignment] to all previ-
ously accepted sequences.

Pairwise structure alignments were made between all pairings of
accepted sequences. These alignments were then ﬁltered such that no
alignments had RMSDs of 33.5 A, had TM scores of <0.S, contained
a sequence with length <60 residues, contained a co-crystallized soluble
protein fragment or were aligned over <60% of the length of the shorter

sequence. Alignments involving sequences without an iMembrane anno-
tation were discarded. This procedure prevents bias in the selected se-
quences, and ensures alignments are between proteins with sufﬁcient
structural similarity for use in modelling.

The alignments were then partitioned into a training set and a test set.
The training set was composed of 73 alignments that satisﬁed these re-
quirements and where both sequences were taken from the ﬁrst category
of the above list. The test set consisted of 165 alignments where neither
sequence was part of the first category. A schematic of this procedure is
provided in Supplementary Figure S1. Properties of the training and test
sets are plotted in Supplementary Figure S2. All alignments can be found
at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/proteins/resources.

3.3 Alignment input

Alignments were made with the proﬁlsproﬁle alignment programs
PROMALS (Pei and Grishin, 2007) and HHsearch v2.0.5 (S6ding,
2005), and with the MSA programs MP-T (this work), MUSCLE
v3.8.3] (Edgar, 2004), MSAProbs v0.9.5 (Liu et al., 2010), MAFFT
V6864 b, T-Coffee v9.01 (Notredame et al., 2000) and clustalQ v1.0.3
(Sievers et al., 2011). We allowed both proﬁlsproﬁle programs to select
their own homologues (see next section), but tested all MSA programs on
identical input sequences, which were collected as described below.

Homologous sequences to each chain were extracted from the
Uniref90 database (accessed 6 February 2012) (Suzek et al., 2007) by
running PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) for ﬁve iterations with
e-value thresholds of 10’3 to keep a hit, and 10’5 to incorporate a hit
into the search proﬁle. Homologues with <15% sequence identity to the
query over the aligned region were discarded, as were those with lengths
<2/3 or >3/2 that of the query. The remaining homologues were ran-
domly ordered and then made non-redundant by UCLUST (Edgar, 2010)
at 80% sequence identity.

For each alignment, the homologues from the template and target
were combined in equal numbers (alternating the order to ﬁrst take a
homologue from the template, then one from the target with any surplus
being discarded), ﬁltered to have lengths >2/3 and <3/2 that of the tem-
plate, and again made redundant at 80% using UCLUST. The ﬁrst 125
sequences were used as input to each aligner. This is similar to the way in
which the general purpose PREFAB benchmark is constructed, but with
a greater number of selected sequences (PREFAB alignments have at
most 50 sequences) and different cut-offs (Edgar, 2004).

This protocol ensures that the MSA contains a reasonable number of
sequences with little bias towards either the target or template, a wide
range of sequence identity and sequences of approximately equal length.

3.4 Optimization of alignment programs

We attempted to ﬁnd optimal settings for each alignment method based
on its performance on our training set.

The default settings of MUSCLE and MSAProbs were found to per-
form well on the training set and so no changes were made. We tested the
L-INS-i and G-INS-i modes of MAFFT and used the former as it had a
higher accuracy. We tested the PSI-Coffee mode of T-Coffee (with the
Uniref90 database for sequence search), as we found it to be more ac-
curate than the default T-Coffee settings, while providing results directly
comparable with those of TM-Coffee. By default, ClustalQ constructs
trees using a variant of the fast mBed algorithm and does not perform
iteration. We found two rounds of iteration, and non-mBed tree construc-
tion improved performance (options: ifull ifull-iter fiter 2) and so ran
these settings.

Although PROMALS (Pei and Grishin, 2007) is capable of performing
a multiple proﬁle alignment, we found that a pairwise proﬁlsproﬁle
alignment was more accurate on our training set. PROMALS comes
with its own sequence database (Uniref90 dated Feb 2007) against
which it ﬁnds homologues using its own copy of BLAST.

HHsearch (S6ding, 2005) is part of HHsuite v. 2.0.5. The suite contains
the HHblits search tool (Remmert et al., 2012), which we used to generate
HMMs for target and template. Searches were conducted against the
nr20 database (version dated 11 January 2010). Both HMMs were anno-
tated by PSIPRED v. 2.5 (Jones, 1999), and the template was further
annotated with DSSP secondary structure states by JOY (Mizuguchi
et al., 1998). Best performance on the training set was obtained by com-
bining a local initial Viterbi algorithm with a global MAC realignment.

We note that HHsearch and PROMALS enjoy the advantages of sec-
ondary structure annotation and homologue selection aimed at optimiz-
ing their performance. Our method, MP-T, also has these advantages.
PSI-Coffee is a homology extension method and so uses more sequences
in each alignment than are available to other methods. MSAProbs,
MAFFT L-INS-i, MUSCLE and ClustalQ are directly comparable
with each other.

3.5 Assessment of alignments and models

Alignment accuracy was assessed with reference to a TM-align structure
alignment between the target and template. Two separate assessments
were made: one over the transmembrane domain only, and the other
over the entire sequence. Transmernbrane domains were deﬁned, using
the ‘membrane layer’ annotation from iMembrane, to be regions that
contain <30 consecutive not-in-membrane layer residues, >15 tail layer
residues and are at least 40-residues long. Putative domains were trimmed
to begin and end with at most 15 consecutive not-in-membrane layer
residues. In the test set, 115 of the 165 alignments contained TM do-
mains: most of the other alignments form soluble parts of TM complexes.

Alignment accuracy is commonly assessed by two related measures:
the modeller score FM and the developer score F D. These scores are dif-
ferent normalizations of the number of correctly aligned residues in an
alignment. In FM, this number is divided by the number of aligned resi-
dues in the alignment being assessed; in F D, it is divided by the number of
aligned residues in the reference alignment (Sauder et al., 2000). An align-
ment with high FM includes few mistakenly aligned residues, but may not
reproduce much of the reference alignment; one with high F D reproduces
a lot of the reference alignment but may misalign residues.

A third measure of alignment accuracy is the number of alignments
where one method aligns 10 residues more correctly than another.
Compared with F D and FM, this measure avoids the problems of normal-
ization and is robust against anomalously good or bad alignments.

Models of transmembrane domains were built with MEDELLER
(Kelm et al., 2010) and assessed using the GDT_TS measure calculated
by the TM-score program (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004) over aligned pairs
of residues. GDT_TS is the average fraction of residues in the model that
are within 1, 2, 4 and 8A of their position in the experimental structure.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Homologue selection

It is unclear how homologues should be chosen to help create a
good sequence alignment between two distantly related proteins.
In this section, we discuss variations on the procedure used
throughout the rest of this work, which is described in Section 3.3.

MSA accuracy is thought to deteriorate as the number of
aligned sequences increases above ~100 (Thompson et al.,
2011), but thousands of homologues can be returned in a
BLAST search. We tested MP—T on our training set with 2}
150 homologues in steps of 25, and found that the accuracy
tended to a ﬁxed upper limit in this range, with little improve-
ment from 7&150 homologues (percentage of the reference
structure alignment that was reproduced, FD: 86.17872, see
Supplementary Fig. S4).

MP-T

 

A feature of our homologue selection procedure is randomiza-
tion. One alternative approach is to order homologues by their
BLAST score, favouring more nearly related sequences. The per-
centages of the reference alignment reproduced when homo-
logues were selected by BLAST score were 82.97864 for
2&150 homologues in steps of 25. For MP—Tirandomized selec-
tions always yield improved accuracy, suggesting that homo-
logues should be diverse and spread over the entire range of
sequence identity.

4.2 Tree building

Progressive multiple alignment requires a ‘guide tree’ to determine
the order of alignment. Counterintuitively, simple tree-building
heuristics such as single-linkage clustering and UPGMA
have been found to lead to more accurate alignments than phylo-
genetically more precise methods such as neighbour joining (NJ)
(Wheeler and Kececioglu, 2007; Plyusnin and Holm, 2012).

In MP—T, tree building determines not just the order in which
sequences are aligned, but also which sequences are used to align
the target and template. For example, a tree with the target and tem-
plate on adjacent leaves would give a standard pairwise alignment,
whereas a tree with the target and template meeting at the root
would involve all other sequences. We tested the tree-building pro-
cedures NJ, BIONJ (Gascuel, 1997), single-linkage clustering and
UPGMA on our training set to determine whether simpler algo-
rithms still led to more accurate alignments in this case.

The algorithms differed in how many sequences they used to
align the target and template. For BIONJ and NJ, on average
~70% of the possible number of homologues were used; for
UPGMA and single-linkage clustering, ~90% of homologues
were used. Despite this, changes in tree building did not greatly
affect accuracy. Single-linkage clustering appeared to be most
accurate and NJ least accurate. We use UPGMA in the remain-
der of this work.

4.3 Alignment accuracy

MP—T alignments have a signiﬁcantly higher average F M (lower
error rate, see Section 3.5) than all other methods, both over the
transmembrane domain and the full alignment (Table 1). Little
variation is seen between the top methods in F D, the fraction of
the reference structure alignment that is reproduced, but meth-
ods that make use of secondary structure annotation (MP-T,
PROMALS and HHsearch) achieve higher scores over the TM
domain. In addition to the methods discussed in Section 3.3,
Table 1 contains results for a version of MP-T that uses no en-
vironment information [MP-T (1 table )], and a version that uses
no homologous sequences [MP-T (pair )].

The small variation in FD over full alignments allows the
intrinsic error rates of the different methods to be compared.
The low error rates of MP—T appear to be a consequence of the
T-Coffee objective criterioniuse of a single environment-
independent substitution table in MP—T drastically reduces per-
formance but still leads to fewer incorrect pairings than for
other methods [MP-T (1 table), Table 1]. After MUSCLE, the
two proﬁleiproﬁle methods PROMALS and HHsearch incor-
rectly align the most residues. We ﬁnd that, in general, MSA
programs incorrectly align a smaller proportion of residues be-
tween the target and template than proﬁleiproﬁle methods. This

MP—T has signiﬁcantly higher values of F M than all other methods. The top—scoring
methods differ little in FD.

“In 2 cases, clustalSZ does not align any residues in the target with those in the
template. We set FM for these alignments to 0. Entries marked with asterisks are
signiﬁcantly different from MP—T (P< 0.01 are marked *, P< 0.1 are marked **).
Signiﬁcance is assessed by a Wilcoxon signed—rank test.

is probably because in a MSA, there are more ways of incorrectly
pairing residues without matching a residue in the target with one
in the template.

For 15 alignments, no method aligned more than 25% of the
residues correctly. These ‘unalignable’ proteins typically have
low sequence identity (average 7%) and are either short or
have the majority of their residues in ﬂ-strands (eight are shorter
than 150 residues; ﬁve are majority ﬂ-strand). The short proteins
paired here may not be homologous, but merely share a large
secondary structure feature. The over-representation of ﬂ-strands
may highlight difﬁculties in deriving a reference alignment from
a ﬂ-barrel structure alignment. For example, models that are
built based on an alignment that differs signiﬁcantly from the
reference should be poor, but in the case of the eight-stranded
ﬂ-barrels 3QRA and 3DZM, a model is built with a GDT_TS of
67.5% despite the MP—T alignment including only 26% of the
residue pairings in the reference alignment.

Table 2 shows the number of alignments for which each
column method correctly aligns at least 10 more residues than
the corresponding row method. The first entry in the table is
assessed over the 115 transmembrane domains, and the entry
in parentheses is assessed over the whole target sequence (165
alignments). MP-T consistently outperforms all other methods
more often than they outperform it, with the advantage being
largest over transmembrane regions. The MP-T (pair) column
performs a pairwise alignment; its poor performance illustrates
the importance of homologues in creating an accurate alignment.

The alignments in the test set are diverseispanning an order
of magnitude in length and sequence identity (Fig. 1a).
Secondary structure content varies from >75% a-helix to
>75% ﬂ-strand. Sequences forming soluble parts of transmem-
brane complexes are also represented, with 50 of the 165 align-
ments having sequences without a transmembrane domain under
our deﬁnition (Section 3.5).

Fig. 1. (a) Alignments for which PROMALS or MP-T aligned at least 10 residues more correctly than the other. The assessment is made over the full
target sequence. The size of each rectangle is a proxy for the size of the MSA for each input: rectangle height is proportional to the number of sequences
in the MP-T alignment, rectangle length is proportional to the length of the target sequence. The scale bar shows a rectangle corresponding to an
alignment made using 100 sequences and with a target length of 500 residues. Rectangles are coloured by the fraction of the structure alignment that
the better performing method reproduced. One point at (—72, 9) falls outside the axes of the graph: PROMALS aligns 63% of the residues correctly.
(b) Distribution of improvements in model accuracy (top) and model coverage (bottom) from using MP-T rather than PROMALS. Models produced
from MP-T alignments provide lower coverage than PROMALS (bars are higher to the left of the origin in the lower panel) but are signiﬁcantly more
accurate (bars are higher to the right of the origin in the upper panel, P< 10’4 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test)

As PROMALS came nearest to parity with MP—T (Table 2),
we selected it to investigate the types of alignments each performs
best. Figure 1a shows all alignments where PROMALS and
MP—T outperform each other by at least 10 residues over the
full alignment. Several cases where MP—T performs less well
(rectangles to the left of the black line) may be attributable to
the use of a small number of homologues to make the alignment
(thin rectangles in the ﬁgure). This can arise either because the
procedure in Section 3.3 returned few homologues or because the
guide tree excluded many homologues (see Section 2).

MP—T appears to perform better on longer proteins (longer bars
to the right of the black line), which is to be expected: differences

between a single substitution table and environment-speciﬁc
tables accumulate with sequence length. However, the improved
performance may also reﬂect the composition of the training set,
which contained only one alignment with a target sequence shorter
than 200 residues (Supplementary Fig. S2). PROMALS may per-
form better at making distant alignments <15% sequence identity,
whereas MP-T has an advantage in the 1&30% identity range,
which is arguably more useful for modelling.

Alignment methods show a greater range of accuracy over
majority ﬂ-strand targets than over majority tit-helical targets.
On average, ﬂ-strand targets are shorter than other targets,
and have lower sequence identity reference alignments that

contain a higher density of gap open events. These factors may
differentiate methods by their gap-penalty schemes.

The above results are obtained when only the template se-
quence is structurally annotated. However, MP—T is capable of
accepting more annotations, derived either from crystal struc-
tures or from prediction programs such as PSIPRED. MP-T’s
internal transfer of structural annotation between sequences is an
implicit prediction of secondary-structure, solvent accessibility
and membrane-positioning. Additional annotations should lead
to improved alignments if they have a lower error rate than these
implicit predictions. An approximate bound to the accuracy
gains from adding more annotations can be found by providing
structural annotations for the target sequence as well as for the
template structure. This increased F M and F D by ~0.7% over
both TM domains and full alignments.

4.4 Model accuracy in the transmembrane region

We built models for the 115 transmembrane domains in the test
set, which in most cases, such as ion channels, is the domain
of interest. Models were built using MP—T, PROMALS
and MUSCLE alignments with the high-accuracy mode of
MEDELLER (Kelm et al., 2010), which incorporates the
FREAD loop-modelling method (Choi and Deane, 2010). The
loops for most targets are present in FREAD’s database, mean-
ing the models built here should be better than those for blind
structure prediction.

PROMALS and MUSCLE were chosen for model building
alongside MP—T as they respectively had the best and worst
alignment accuracy of the methods against which we compared.
PROMALS has also been successful in the CASP competition
(Moult et al., 2011). Model accuracy was assessed by calculating

the model GDT_TS. This is a number in the range (0, 1), with
higher values corresponding to more accurate models. To isolate
the contribution of the alignment method to the model,
GDT_TS was calculated only over pairs of residues that were
aligned in the input sequence alignment. Models were built using
the full sequence alignment, as in the MEDELLER procedure
this cannot worsen the transmembrane model, but can improve
100p modelling.

MP—T produces models of significantly higher GDT_TS than
PROMALS or MUSCLE (P< 10—4, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
The upper panel of Figure 1b shows the distribution of improve-
ments in model GDT_TS gained by using MP—T rather than
PROMALS. For example, for 30 of the 115 models, MP—T align-
ments led to a 2.}7.5% improvement in model GDT_TS com-
pared with models made with PROMALS. The small height of
bars to the left of the origin shows that MP—T rarely generates
signiﬁcantly worse models than PROMALS. The lower panel of
Figure 1b shows that PROMALS alignments lead to models
with higher coverage than MP—T. On average, MUSCLE’s
models had the lowest GDT_TS and the lowest coverage,
demonstrating that less accurate alignments lead to less accurate
models.

Figure 2 illustrates improved model building at low sequence
identity. The target (PDB code: lIZL, chain D gray) and tem-
plate (PDB code: lOGV, chain M) are taken from photosyn-
thetic reaction centres. Models from MP—T (left) and
PROMALS (right) are colour coded per residue by the distance
to the corresponding residue in the crystal structure (0A:
blue,>5A=red). Numbering transmembrane helices 175 from
left to right, MP-T models more of the loop region above helix 1,
and more of helix 4 than PROMALS. MP—T assigns the correct
residues to helix 1, whereas the PROMALS model introduces a

and template share 15% sequence identity. Residues in the model are colored by the distance to their position in the crystal structure: blue residues are
close to their native position, red residues are 35A away from their native position. The model on the left is built using MP-T, whereas that on the right is
built using PROMALS. The MP-T model provides a more accurate representation of helix 1, and models the region above this helix

large shift (in the red helix, each residue is at least 5A from its
true position).

5 CONCLUSION

We have created a program, MP—T, to perform sequence to
structure alignment for the homology modelling of membrane
proteins. Tested on a set of 165 diverse structure alignments,
MP—T is found to introduce the fewest misaligned residues
(high FM) while aligning as accurately as the state-of-the-art
methods HHsearch and PROMALS (Table 1). MP—T performs
particularly well on longer membrane proteins (a category that
includes drug targets such as GPCRs and ion channels) and in
the twilight zone (1&30% sequence identity).

The accuracy of MP—T is derived from its effective use of in-
formation about accessible surface area, membrane positioning
and secondary structure. This information is obtained from the
template structure and used to make predictions about the same
properties of homologous sequences. Gap penalties and substi-
tution scores are adjusted on a per-residue basis depending on
this informationifor example, the creation of gaps in the middle
of the membrane is discouraged, and substitutions within a helix
are scored according to the propensity for an amino acid type to
be in a helix.

Choice of homologues is found to be the single greatest factor
affecting alignment accuracy for our method. Selecting homo-
logues to favour sequences that are more closely related to the
target and template leads to substantially less accurate align-
ments than random selection. It is likely that improvements in
accuracy can be gained by further reﬁning the selection process:
for example, by loosening cut-offs if too few sequences are
returned.

In agreement with previous studies, we find that guide tree
construction does not strongly affect alignment accuracy.
However, the general trend is that single-linkage clustering is a
better method for building guide trees than neighbour joining,
BIONJ or UPGMA.

We perform no sequence weighting, no iterative reﬁnement
and use a simpler consistency criterion than those used in leading
multiple sequence aligners such as MSAProbs. Despite this,
the use of environment-aware gap penalties and substitution
tables allows us to produce more accurate models of transmem-
brane domains than other methods tested. Incorporation of en-
vironment awareness into a more sophisticated aligner may yield
even larger improvements in the quality of membrane protein
models.

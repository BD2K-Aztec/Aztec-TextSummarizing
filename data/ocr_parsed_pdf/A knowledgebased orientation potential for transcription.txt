ABSTRACT

Motivation: Computational modeling of protein—DNA complexes
remains a challenging problem in structural bioinformatics. One of
the key factors for a successful protein—DNA docking is a potential
function that can accurately discriminate the near-native structures
from decoy complexes and at the same time make conformational
sampling more efficient. Here, we developed a novel orientation-
dependent, knowledge-based, residue-level potential for improving
transcription factor (T F)-DNA docking.

Results: We demonstrated the performance of this new potential in
TF—DNA binding affinity prediction, discrimination of native protein—
DNA complex from decoy structures, and most importantly in rigid
TF—DNA docking. The rigid TF—DNA docking with the new orientation
potential, on a benchmark of 38 complexes, successfully predicts
42% of the cases with root mean square deviations lower than 1A
and 55% of the cases with root mean square deviations lower than
3A. The results suggest that docking with this new orientation-
dependent, coarse-grained statistical potential can achieve high-
docking accuracy and can serve as a crucial first step in multi-stage
flexible protein—DNA docking.

1 INTRODUCTION

ProteiniDNA interactions play crucial roles in many biological
processes. Transcription factors (TFs), which bind to speciﬁc
cis—regulatory elements on DNA and regulate gene expression,
represent one of the largest groups of proteins in many genomes
(Babu et al., 2004; Janga and Collado-Vides, 2007). How TFs
recognize and bind speciﬁcally to their DNA target sequences,
despite of decades of efforts, is still not fully understood.
Benefited from the technical advances in experimental structure
determination, high-resolution structures of TFiDNA com-
plexes have provided a glimpse of TFiDNA interaction in
each complex. A collection of such Views may offer valuable
insights into the molecular mechanism of TFiDNA recognition
and the evolution of gene regulatory networks (Luscombe and

Thornton, 2002). A TFiDNA complex model is also a starting
point for structure-based TF—binding site prediction, which has
received much research attention recently (Angarica et al., 2008;
Kaplan et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2008; Siggers and Honig, 2007; Xu
et al., 2009).

Despite technical advances in experimental structure determin-
ation, only a small percentage of TFiDNA complex structures
have been solved and deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB)
(Berman et al., 2000). Computational docking between a protein
and DNA, on the other hand, has been considered as a
cost-efﬁcient alternative to the usually time-consuming experi-
mental methods. Macromolecule docking relies on some sorts
of energy functions for building complex models (Pande, 2011).
There are two major types of the potentials for studying proteini
DNA interactions: physics-based (Donald et al., 2007; Endres
et al., 2004) and knowledge-based (Liu et al., 2005; Robertson
and Varani, 2007; Xu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2005). For ex-
ample, van Dijk et a]. applied a physics-based potential, origin-
ally developed for proteiniprotein docking, to proteiniDNA
docking (van Dijk and Bonvin, 2010; van Dijk et al., 2006).
Knowledge-based potentials, derived from experimental struc-
tures, are considered more attractive and have more practical
value in structural bioinformatics studies owing to their relative
simplicity (Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1985; Pande, 2011; Sippl,
1990; Sippl, 1995; Zhou and Zhou, 2002). These knowledge-
based potentials generally vary in their resolutions, from
residue-level to atom-level and in their distance scales, from
distance-independent to distance-dependent (Gao and Skolnick,
2008; Kono and Sarai, 1999; Liu et al., 2005; Luscombe et al.,
2001; Robertson and Varani, 2007; Xu et al., 2009; Zhang et al.,
2005; Zhao et al., 2010).

Although high-resolution, atomic-level potentials can provide
the details needed to accurately discriminate near-native struc-
tures from decoys, coarse-grained potentials can have a smooth
and less-rugged energy landscape, making it less likely to get
trapped in local minima during conformational search (Ayton
et al., 2007; Bradley et al., 2005; Flores et al., 2012; Kim and
Hummer, 2008; Poulain et al., 2008). Another advantage of the
coarse-grained potentials at residue-nucleotide level is their cap-
ability in addressing the dynamic nature of macromolecules, as
they are less sensitive to small conformational changes (Bradley
et al., 2005; Gopal et al., 2010; Vreven et al., 2011). To take
advantage of both the coarse-level and the atomic-level poten-

tials, multi-scale approaches are often adopted, in which
near-native models are constructed ﬁrst with a coarse-level po-

tential followed by reﬁnement with high-resolution potentials
(Chen and Xu, 2006; Murphy et al., 2003; Vreven et al., 2011).

A knowledge-based orientation potential

 

In this study, we focus on the development of a novel
knowledge-based, residue-level potential for accurate docking
between TFs and their DNA target sequences. Previous studies
have revealed different interaction ‘modes’ between TFs and
other major types of DNA-binding proteins, such as restriction
enzymes and non-speciﬁc DNA-binding proteins (Ashworth and
Baker, 2009; Contreras-Moreira et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011). In
addition, the negatively charged residues, aspartate and glutam-
ate, are overrepresented in restriction enzymes compared with
other types of DNA-binding proteins (Pingoud et al., 2005).
As the major goal of this study is to develop a proteiniDNA
interaction potential for assessing TFiDNA binding affinity in
TFiDNA docking, non-TF proteiniDNA complexes including
restriction enzymes and non-speciﬁc DNA-binding proteins are
not included in the dataset for potential development.

Liu et a]. have previously developed a knowledge-based,
residue-level potential based on statistical analysis of known
TFiDNA complex structures (Liu et al., 2005). The potential
uses DNA tri-nucleotides, called triplets, as an interaction unit
to study the interactions between TF and DNA molecules. The
triplets could be real nucleotides with explicit positions (native
nucleotides) or pseudo-nucleotide placeholders that do not make
any structural or energy contribution toward potential calcula-
tion. The triplet representation has the advantage of covering
both the preference of individual bases and the local environment
around the nucleotides. It has been shown that this multi-body
potential performs well in assessing TFiDNA interactions and in
proteiniDNA docking (Liu et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2008).

The binding speciﬁcity between a DNA and a protein is gen-
erally contributed by hydrogen bonds. It has been shown that
two-thirds of the hydrogen bonds between amino acids and bases
lead to speciﬁc complex interactions (Angarica et al., 2008).
Kono and Sarai have previously studied the radial and angular
distributions for hydrogen bonds and found that the angular
distributions of protein atoms around potential hydrogen-bond
forming atoms of bases have different patterns (Kono and Sarai,
1999). The strength of a hydrogen bond is usually deﬁned by
bond length(s) and angle(s) between a donor and an acceptor
(Baker and Hubbard, 1984; Frishman and Argos, 1995; Wade
and Goodford, 1993). Therefore, adding angular information to
a statistical potential can be expected to improve the accuracy in
assessing TFiDNA binding afﬁnity and specificity.

In this article, we present an orientation-dependent, knowl-
edge-based potential derived from a non-redundant set of TF7
DNA complex structures through converting the observed fre-
quencies of base-residue pairs with respect to both distances
and angles to a potential based on Boltzmann’s principle. The
performance of the new potential was assessed through binding
affinity prediction and TFiDNA rigid docking. The results show
much better accuracy in TFiDNA binding afﬁnity prediction and
rigid TFiDNA docking with the new orientation potential when
compared with the residue potential without angle information.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets

A non-redundant dataset of 160 TFiDNA complex structures was ﬁrst
generated from PDB for deriving the new orientation potential

(Supplementary Table S1) (Berman et al., 2000). These complex struc-
tures were solved by X-ray crystallography with resolutions 3.5A or
better and R-factors of at most 0.3. The TFs in the complexes have
4(P1000 amino acids. Redundant TF chains are removed with a sequence
identity cutoff of 55%. To eliminate any potential bias when constructing
a non-redundant dataset in structural bioinformatics, it would be ideal to
use a lower sequence identity cutoff. However, when only a limited
number of complex structures are available, there are drawbacks for se-
lecting representatives with a lower cutoff, as discussed in previous stu-
dies. First, statistical analysis based on a small dataset would suffer the
low-count problem, particularly in cases with a large number of combin-
ations of cases (Luscombe et al., 2001). Second, homologous TFs can
bind to different DNA sequences, and the binding patterns may be
unique to the speciﬁc TFiDNA complex. Inclusion of these entries
may maximize the diversity of proteiniDNA interactions (Kim and
Guo, 2009; Luscombe et al., 2001; Prabakaran et al., 2006). Therefore,
there is a trade-off between the degree of redundancy and the statistical
signiﬁcance of the potentials. Taking both into account, we settled on a
cutoff of 55%.

For TFiDNA docking evaluations, we used our previously developed
rigid TFiDNA docking benchmark (Kim et al., 2011). This benchmark
contains 38 non-redundant cases that are classiﬁed into two groups in
terms of expected docking difﬁculty. Each case in the benchmark is a TF7
DNA binding unit deﬁned as an entity of a DNA double-helix and one or
more TF-chains that interact with each other with at least three residu&
residue contacts based on a heavy-atom distance cutoff of 4.5 A. The TFs
in the 38 complexes have <35% sequence identity and do not have over-
lap with the 160 complexes for potential development based on the selec-
tion criteria.

2.2 Development of the orientation potential

For the development of our new orientation potential, we applied a simi-
lar statistical approach used in developing the multi-body potential (Liu
et al., 2005). Owing to the limited number of non-redundant TFiDNA
complexes, we only consider distance and angle information while drop-
ping the multi-body term. Figure 1 illustrates the angle used for the new
potential. The angle (p represents the angle between two vectors. One
vector is deﬁned based on the DNA bases, which is either from N9 to
N1 for adenine and guanine or from N1 to C4 for cytosine and thymine
(Fig. 1A and B). The other vector is a projection of the residue sidechain
vector (from the Cﬂ atom to the sidechain centroid) onto the base plane
(Fig. 1C). A pseudo Cﬂ position is calculated for glycine as described
previously (Liu et al., 2005). For glycine and alanine, Ca£ﬂ vector is
used instead, as there are no heavy atoms beyond the Cﬂ position of the
sidechain. The angles are grouped into three bins (—60° 5 (p <0°, 0° 5 (p
<60°, and —120° 5 (p< —60° and 60° 5 (p< 120°). To further reduce the
total number of possible combinations, some residues are grouped to-
gether based on both the physicochemical properties of amino acids and
the low raw count in known TFiDNA complexes. In this study, ALA,
ILE, LEU, PRO and VAL are combined into one group, whereas SER
and THR belong to another group.

The distance r between a residue and a base is represented by the
distance between the centroid of the residue sidechain and the centroid
of the base. The bin width is set at 1A with a distance cutoff of 15 A,
meaning there is no interaction between a residue and a base if they are
separated by >15 A. The correction of the observed fractions of inter-
actions, owing to incomplete training set, is ﬁrst carried out by introdu-
cing two exponential parameters (or and ,8) for the fraction of interacting
residues Wren-due and the fraction of interacting bases Wbm, respectively
(Equation 1). In Equation 1, N,,(r, (p) is the corrected number of inter-
actions between protein residue i and DNA base j, and N$(r,(p) is the
initial number of interactions between protein residue 1' and DNA base j.
Low count effects are removed by an offset parameter a. A cutoff on the
number of interactions New,“ is set to 1.

The two exponential parameters (or, ,8) and the offset parameter a are
optimized using a Z—score optimization approach (see detailed description
for Equations 6 and 7). F(r) is a distance normalization function for
removing the distance effect. We used F(r) = 0.535 *(rA3 .345) as described
previously (Liu et al., 2005). After the correction of the observed inter-
action frequency with those parameters, we convert the frequency to the
potential by Boltzmann law (Equations 241).

Equation 2 describes the relationship between the observed probability

an interaction between residue 1' and base j with a distance r and an angle
(p, where T is temperature, k is Boltzmann constant and Z is the partition
function. The uniform density reference is used for each distance-angle
bin (Equation 3), where pg-(r, (p) is the mean probability of the interactions
between residues and bases with a distance r and an angle (p. Energy

The interaction energy E for a proteiniDNA complex is the sum of the
energies (r, (p) of all residue-base interactions (Equation 5). In Equation
6, Z,, the critical Z-score, is the gap between the native energy EMU-W, of
complex t, and the average energy of the decoys <E,> and 8(E,) is the
standard deviation of the decoy energies. An average Z-score for M
complexes is computed as in Equation 7. Z-soore optimization is per-
formed to derive or, ,8 and a by a Monte Carlo simulated annealing ap-
proach. The cooling rate is set at 0.998 with a convergence of 1076. The
goal is to minimize the average Z-score by changing the parameter values
of or, ,8 and 0 using the native and decoy complexes of the 160 TFiDNA
complexes. In this work, parameters or, ,8 and a are 0.644, 0.787 and
0.440, respectively.

2.3 Assessment of the orientation potential

2.3.] Binding aﬂinity We compared the predicted binding afﬁnity
with the experimental binding-free energies of 25 proteiniDNA com-
plexes (PDBID: 1aay, 1apl, 1az0, 1azp, 1bc7, lbhm, 1bp7, lcaS, lcdw,
1cma, 1cw0, lecr, 1glu, lhcr, lipp, llmb, lnfk, loct, 1par, lqrv, ltro,
lrun, ltsr, lysa, lytf). These complexes were selected from the dataset
with 30 complexes used by Xu et a]. (2009). The ﬁve complexes that
appeared in our 160-complex dataset for potential development are not
considered.

2.3.2 Discrimination of native structures from decoys Z-scores
were calculated to test how well the new potential can discriminate the
native proteiniDNA complex from docking decoys. The 2000 lowest root
mean square deviation (RMSD) docking decoys for each of the 27 DNA7
protein complexes (PDBID: 1a1i, 1a73, 1au7, 1bc8, lckq, 1d02, ldfm,
ldmu, leon, 1f4k, 1g9z, 1h8a_a, 1h8a_b, lhlv, ljko, 1131, lmjo, lmnn,
lpdn, lqna, 1tc3, ltro, lzme, 2hdd, 3barn, 3pvi, 6pax) were selected from
the 45 cases used by Robertson and Varani (Robertson and Varani, 2007)
after removing the 18 complexes that are in our dataset for potential
development to avoid potential biases. Z-scores were calculated as
described in Equation 6. The RMSD was computed between the back-
bone heavy atoms of the native DNA and the docked DNA structure
after ﬁxing the protein positions.

2.3.3 Rigid TFPDNA docking The performance of the orientation
potential in rigid TFiDNA docking was assessed with our previously
developed proteiniDNA docking program (Liu et al., 2008). The pro-
gram uses a Monte Carlo simulated annealing approach to search for a
docked TFiDNA conformation with the optimal interaction energy. The
energy function consists of binding afﬁnity and van der Waals packing
energy. The primary role of adding the packing energy to the docking is
to guide the docking process without affecting the ﬁnal docked structures
(its contribution to the ﬁnal energy approaches zero as the random walk
progresses). The movements include rotations with a step size of 2° and
translations with a step size of 0.1 A. The simulation stops when it con-
verges or it reaches a total number of 1.5 million steps. Two hundred
independent Monte Carlo simulations were carried out for each TF7
DNA complex. Protein and DNA are harmonically constrained with a
cutoff of 14A between the protein pocket and the centroids of DNA. We
tested the performance of the new orientation potential on our previously
developed TFiDNA rigid docking benchmark (Kim et al., 2011). To
evaluate the docking accuracy, we compared the docked DNA

conformations with the corresponding DNA structures in the native TF7
DNA complexes by ﬁxing the protein positions and calculated the
RMSDs between the predicted and the native complex using DNA back-
bone heavy atoms.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Binding afﬁnity and decoy discrimination

We ﬁrst tested how well the new potential can predict the binding
afﬁnity. Figure 2 shows the correlations between experimental
binding afﬁnity and the predicted binding afﬁnity using either
the orientation potential (Fig. 2A) or the multi-body potential, a
knowledge-based residue level potential developed by Liu et a].
(Fig. 2B) (Liu et al., 2005). The correlation coefﬁcient between
the predicted binding afﬁnity with orientation potential and
the experimental energy is 0.57 (P—Value=0.01), whereas the
multi-body potential has a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.41
(P—Value=0.02). The performance of the orientation potential
is on par with VFIRE, an all-atom, knowledge-based DFIRE
function that includes volume fraction (correlation coefﬁcients
0.57 for the orientation potential versus 0.55 for VFIRE) 0(u
et al., 2009).

Our main goal of this study is to develop a better and efﬁcient
potential for improving TFiDNA docking performance. Thus, it
is important to assess the potential’s capability for discriminating
the native or near native structures from decoy structures. We
tested it on a docking decoy set by Robertson and Varani (see
Methods) and demonstrated the discriminative power based on
Z—scores: Z—score:(Emtive—EangS, where Emu-,6 is the pre-
dicted binding afﬁnity for the native complex, and Ea,g and S
are the average and standard deviation of the binding afﬁnities of
decoy complexes, respectively. A higher Z—score, especially a
positive Z—score, would suggest a lower discriminative power.
Overall, the orientation potential outperforms the multi-body
potential based on Z—score comparisons (Fig. 3). All except for
one case (lckq) with orientation potential have negative
Z—scores, whereas there are eight complexes (1d02, lhlv, 1131,
1tc3, ltro, lzme, 3bam and 3pVi) having positive Z—scores calcu-
lated with the multi—body potential. We should point out that the
binding afﬁnities calculated from the orientation and multi—body
potentials are at a similar scale, otherwise the direct comparison
of Z—scores would be less meaningful.

In addition to Z—score comparison, another way to test the
performance improvement of the new potential is to assess the re-
lationship between the binding afﬁnity of a decoy and the struc-
tural distance between this decoy structure and the native
complex in terms of RMSD. Two such examples, 1a1i and
1131, are shown in Figure 4 (AiC for 1ali; DiF for 1131), in

which we compared the binding afﬁnities predicted by the orien-
tation potential, multi-body potential and DDNA2. DDNA2 is
a program for predicting proteiniDNA binding afﬁnity using
a knowledge-based, atomic-level potential 0(u et al., 2009).
Consistent with the Z—score data, the orientation potential clearly
performs better than the multi-body potential and achieves a
similar performance to DDNA2. Similar results were observed
in other cases (Supplementary Fig. Sl). To quantitatively com-
pare the performance of the orientation potential with the
multi-body potential and DDNA2, we counted the number of
‘false positive’ decoys in each of the 27 cases. A decoy is con-
sidered as a ‘false positive’ if its binding afﬁnity is lower than the
binding afﬁnity of the native structure, and its RMSD with re-
spect to the native structure is >5A. The number of false

positives using the orientation potential is much smaller than
that using the multi—body potential. The performance of the
orientation potential is close to that of DDNA2, which is an
atomic-level potential (Supplementary Fig. S2).

It is worth mentioning that the decoy set by Robertson and
Varani was not designed for testing only TFs (Robertson and
Varani, 2007). In addition to TFs, the 27 complexes also contain
other DNA-binding proteins, including nine restriction endo-
nucleases and ﬁve others. Although the orientation potential
was developed using a set of TFs, no obvious differences were
observed between TFs and non-TF complexes. This is not sur-
prising, as majority of these non-TF proteins are speciﬁc DNA-
binding proteins. The key difference though is the high occur-
rences of aspartate and glutamate involved in metal coordination
and catalytic activities in these enzymes compared with TFs
(data not shown) (Pingoud et al., 2005).

3.2 Assessment of the orientation potential in rigid
TF—DNA docking prediction

TFiDNA rigid docking was carried out with either the orienta-
tion or the multi-body potential using our previously developed
Monte Carlo-based proteiniDNA docking program (Liu et al.,
2008). The TFiDNA docking benchmark with 21 easy and 17
hard targets was used for performance comparison (Kim et al.,
2011). The docking results based on 200 independent Monte
Carlo simulations for each case are shown in Table 1 (for orien-
tation potential) and Supplementary Table S2 (for multi-body
potential). Each table shows the docking energy and RMSD for
both the conformation with the lowest energy and the conform-
ation with the smallest RMSD.

Figure 5 shows that the docking accuracy with the orientation
potential is signiﬁcantly better than that with the multi-body

constructed 16 (42%, 13 easy and 3 hard targets) TFeDNA

only eight (21%, six easy and two hard targets) complexes with
RMSDs of 51  were reconstructed with the multi-body poten-
tial (Fig. 5, column B). When the evaluation was done using the
smallest RMSD, we found that 19 of 38 complexes (50%, 15 easy
and 4 hard targets) have at least one docked conformation with
RMSD <1 using the orientation potential (Fig. 5, column C);

H). The results also support the classiﬁcation of docking difﬁ-
culty based on the interaction strength between protein and
DNA (Kim et al., 2011). Both potentials made much more cor-
rect prediction for the easy cases than for the hard cases (Fig. 5,
Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2).

Docking with the orientation potential correctly reconstructed
eight more targets with 51 RMSD based on the lowest dock-
ing energy (Table 1, Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 5). Target
1aay represents one of these eight cases (Fig. 6A and B). Docking
with the orientation potential produced 12 near-native structures
with RMSDs of 51 (inset plot in Fig. 6A), whereas docking
with the multi-body potential failed to produce any near-native
structures (Fig. 6B).

Owing to the statistical nature of the Monte Carlo docking
algorithm, another way to assess the docking performance is to
check the ‘easiness’ (or difﬁculty) of finding a ‘hit’ in docking
simulations (Wu et al., 2012). For example, if only one of the 200
docked TFeDNA conformations is a correct structure, it is
highly possible that a second docking experiment for this
target with 200 independent simulations fails to reconstruct a
native or near-native structure. On the other hand, it would be
easier to make consistent and correct predictions if more
near-native structures are reconstructed from 200 independent
Monte Carlo docking simulations. One such example is shown
in Figure 6 (C and D). Docking simulations for 1qn4 resulted in
correct predictions with both the orientation and the multi—body
potentials based on the lowest docking energy. The numbers of
near-native conformations, however, are dramatically different.
There are nine for the orientation potential and only one for the
multi-body potential (Fig. 6C and D).

170

The orientation potential correctly predicted all the cases that
were reconstructed using the multi-body potential with 1cma as
the only exception (Fig. 6E and F). The energy-RMSD scatter-
plot for all the docking targets are shown in Supplementary
Figure S3. Figure 7 demonstrates major improvement in produ-
cing more near-native structures (<1 A) when using the orienta-
tion potential for rigid docking than those with the multi-body
potential. The number of ‘hits’ based on 3A cutoff is shown in
Supplementary Figure S4.

Owing to the relatively small size of the benchmark set, we
further performed the rigid docking experiments on a larger set
with 66 TFeDNA complex structures. To construct a larger
dataset, a higher sequence identity cutoff is necessary owing to
the limited number of TFeDNA complex structures in PDB.
These 66 complexes have <70% protein sequence identity with
resolutions of 3.5  or better. We observed a similar performance
improvement to the benchmark set. Docking with the orientation
potential resulted a significantly better docking accuracy in each
category (~20% improvement) when compared with the
multi-body potential (Supplementary Figure SS, Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4). We also noticed that the docking accuracy of
this large dataset is better than the benchmark. The difference
can be a result of two contributing factors. One is that the re-
dundancy level of the large set (70% sequence identity cutoff) is
higher than that in the benchmark (<35% sequence identity).
The other is that the large set has more entries with larger pro-
teineDNA interaction interface (Supplementary Fig. S6) as we
showed earlier that a complex with larger proteineDNA inter-
action interface is relatively easier to predict than the ones with
smaller interaction interface (Kim et al., 2011).

A knowledge-based orientation potential

 

Taken together, we observed a much better docking perform-
ance for the orientation potential in reconstructing complexes in
terms of ﬁnding the native or near-native conformations (Fig. 5,
Supplementary Figs SS and S6). Docking with the orientation
potential also produced more near-native structures than the
multi-body potential when using the same docking procedure
(Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs SS and S6). In addition, the com-
putation time using the new orientation potential is only slightly
more than that with the multi-body potential, 51 :l:20.6 min
versus 42:l: 18.2min based on the 66 docking targets
(Supplementary Fig. S7).

4 CONCLUSION

We have developed an orientation-dependent, knowledge-based
residue-level potential and assessed its performance with a var-
iety of testsibinding afﬁnity prediction, decoy discrimination
and rigid TFeDNA docking. The new potential has a much
better proteineDNA binding afﬁnity prediction capability than
our previously developed multi-body residue-level potential. Our
results also show that the performance of this residue-level,
orientation potential is close to some of the atomic-level poten-
tials, such as VFIRE, though it is less accurate than cFIRE or
chIRE 0(u et al., 2009). This is not surprising, as the atom-level
potentials have more detailed information on the interaction.
However, the main purpose of this new, coarse-grained potential
is for improving TFeDNA docking predictions. A coarse-
grained potential has an advantage in addressing the dynamic
nature of macromolecules, as it is less sensitive to small conform-
ational changes.

Although the use of atomic details offers the accuracy in scor-
ing, the rugged energy landscape and the time-consuming energy
calculations at atomistic level can get a docking simulation
trapped in the local minima (Ayton et al., 2007; Bradley et al.,
2005; Flores et al., 2012; Kim and Hummer, 2008; Poulain et al.,
2008), making a thorough sampling of the conformational space
nearly impossible. The common strategy in many protein folding
or docking studies is to apply a multi—scale approach by explor-
ing the conformational space ﬁrst at the residue-level and then
refining the structure(s) at the atomistic level (Chen and Xu,
2006; Murphy et al., 2003; Vreven et al., 2011).

By introducing an angle term, we were able to achieve much
better prediction accuracy when compared with the multi-body
potential in all the tests. In our current procedure, we adopted
the distance correction function in the multi-body potential with-
out normalizing the angle term (Liu et al., 2005). As the distance
and the angle are related, one potential future improvement of
this orientation potential is to develop a methodology for nor-
malizing a distance and angle function F(r,<p).

This novel orientation potential could be useful in develop-
ment of new docking algorithms, especially in ﬂexible TF7
DNA docking in which the starting structures are in unbound
state and undergo conformational change on binding, as our
residue-level potential is less sensitive to conformational changes
(Chen and Xu, 2006; Murphy et al., 2003; Vreven et al., 2011).
We will develop a strategy for applying the new potential to
ﬂexible proteineDNA docking, a much more challenging prob-
lem in structural bioinformatics.

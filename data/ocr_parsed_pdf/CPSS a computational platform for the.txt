ABSTRACT

Summary: Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have
been widely used to document the small ribonucleic acids (RNAs)
implicated in a variety of biological, physiological and pathological
processes. An integrated computational tool is needed for handling
and analysing the enormous datasets from small RNA deep
sequencing approach. Herein, we present a novel web server,
CPSS (a computational platform for the analysis of small RNA
deep sequencing data), designed to completely annotate and
functionally analyse microRNAs (miRNAs) from NGS data on one
platform with a single data submission. Small RNA NGS data can
be submitted to this server with analysis results being returned
in two parts: (i) annotation analysis, which provides the most
comprehensive analysis for small RNA transcriptome, including
length distribution and genome mapping of sequencing reads, small
RNA quantification, prediction of novel miRNAs, identification of
differentially expressed miRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs and other
non-coding small RNAs between paired samples and detection
of miRNA editing and modifications and (ii) functional analysis,
including prediction of miRNA targeted genes by multiple tools,
enrichment of gene ontology terms, signalling pathway involvement
and protein—protein interaction analysis for the predicted genes.
CPSS, a ready-to-use web server that integrates most functions of
currently available bioinformatics tools, provides all the information
wanted by the majority of users from small RNA deep sequencing
datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs), which do not encode
proteins, include ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, microRNAs
(miRNA), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and other RNA species.
These RNAs participate in a surprisingly diverse collection of
regulatory events (Moazed, 2009). miRNAs have received particular
attention due to their negative role in widespread regulation
of mRNA metabolism through direct base pairing interactions
at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (Carthew and
Sontheimer, 2009). To better understand the regulatory roles
of miRNAs and other small RNAs in different tissues and
developmental stages, the expression proﬁles of small RNAs need
to be assessed.

Recently, the emergence of the next generation sequencing (NGS)
techniques has revolutionized the identiﬁcation of small RNAs with
particularly high levels of sensitivity and accuracy (Zhou et (11.,
2011). Several published tools detecting non-coding RNA proﬁles
from NGS data have been developed. For example, miRExpress
(Wang et (11., 2009) is a stand-alone software for detecting known
miRNAs and novel miRNAs. miRanalyzer (Hackenberg et (11.,
2009), which also offers stand-alone version, is a web server tool
that can detect known and novel miRNAs, identify differentially
expressed miRNAs and predict miRNA targets. Squuster (Pantano
et (11., 2010), offering a web-based toolkit and stand-alone version,
focuses on detecting miRNA variants/isoforms for known miRNAs
and can also be used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs
and predict miRNA targets. There are several recent comprehensive
tools designed to analyse NGS data. mirTools (Zhu et (11., 2010)
is a web-based tool designed to explore the genome map and
length distribution of short reads and to classify them into known
categories, to detect differentially expressed miRNAs and to predict
novel miRNAs and their secondary structures. DARIO (Fasold et (11.,
2011) is a free web service for detecting and normalizing non-coding
RNA expression and predicting novel non-coding RNAs. WapRNA
(Zhao et (11., 2011) is not used only to detect miRNA expression
proﬁle from small RNA NGS data but also to analyse mRNA NGS
data (detailed overview of CPSS and other 13 bioinformtics tools are
shown in Supplementary Table S1). Until now, none of the currently
available tools provides functional analysis for predicted targets of
miRNAs from NGS data, which could help users to ﬁnd potentially

candidate genes/pathways for further experimental or computational
studies. Thus, a comprehensive and systematic tool, integrating most
features of previous tools with functional analysis for predicted
targets of miRNAs from NGS data, is still needed.

Herein, we present a novel and free web server, CPSS, which
integrates most functions of currently available bioinformatics tools
(Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). By using
CPSS, small RNA NGS data can be analysed systematically in
one platform after a single submission of data by integration of
annotation and functional analysis of novel and/or differentially
expressed miRNAs. CPSS generates an analysis report including:
(i) annotation analysis, which provides a comprehensive analysis for
small RNA transcriptome, such as length distribution and genome
mapping of sequencing reads, small RNA annotation, prediction of
novel miRNAs, identiﬁcation of differentially expressed miRNAs,
piRNAs and other non-coding small RNAs between paired samples
and detection of miRNA editing and modiﬁcations and (ii) functional
analysis, which provides the functional analysis of miRNAs, e.g.
predicting miRNA target genes by multi-tools, enriching gene
ontology (GO) terms, performing signalling pathways and analysing
protein—protein interaction (PPI) for the predicted genes (Fig. 1).

2 WORKFLOW

CPSS provides an easy-to-use interface, allowing users to
conveniently analyse the data of small RNA transcriptome from
NGS techniques. Users submit the input data in FASTA format or
FASTA ﬁles compressed in *.gz format, and the FASTA format
(*.fa) ﬁles can be transformed from the raw data, which contain
unprecedented amounts of reads generated by Illumina Genome
Analyzer, 454 FLX instrument or SOLiDTM system. The overall
workﬂow of CPSS is shown in Supplementary Figure S2. First,
the remaining clean sequences in FASTA format ﬁltered above
are classiﬁed into several categories, i.e. miRNA, piRNA, other
non-coding small RNAs, mRNA, genomic repeats, etc. Then,
the sequences that can be mapped to the reference genome but

cannot be assigned to any of the referred annotations are used to
predict novel miRNAs using mireap (http://sourceforge.net/projects/
mireap) or miRDeep (Friedlander et (11., 2008), and their secondary
structures are predicted by RNAfold (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/).
The potential target genes will be predicted for the most abundant
novel/known miRNAs from one sample and for all the differentially
expressed miRNAs from two paired samples automatically by eight
miRNA target prediction tools. For functional analysis of miRNAs,
the predicted targets are mapped to the GO annotation dataset
(Ashburner et (11., 2000) and used to extract the enriched GO
processes using the Fisher’s exact test (enrichment ratio >2 and
P <0.01). Then, the genes in the enriched GO processes are matched
to the signal pathway annotation datasets from KEGG (Kanehisa
et (11., 2010) and PPI annotation dataset from String (Jensen et (11.,
2009). (The details of algorithm for every step are presented in
Supplementary Material.) CPSS is ready-to-use for most users
without the need to change any of the default analysis parameters.
However, users can also modify most of the parameters according
to their advanced requirements. The ﬁnal results are presented to
users as graphic summary in a browser (Fig. 1) and detailed results
are saved in a *.gz ﬁle that can be downloaded from the server.

Currently, CPSS is able to handle the data from either one or two
samples on a centralized platform and can complete a job within 0.5—
3 h, depending on data size, species and selection of parameters. This
server displays the status of a job and sends a reminder email to users
when the job is done. Users can retrieve the analysis results from
the stored jobs with a unique ID generated randomly by the server
for each job. Most strikingly, the annotation and functional analysis
of novel and/or differentially expressed miRNAs from small RNA
NGS data can be completed in one platform, CPSS, after a single
submission of data.

2.1 Case studies

To evaluate the performance of CPSS, several small RNA
sequencing data from our laboratory are tested. First, one sample
from human ovary was uploaded to CPSS (Zhang et (11., 2011).
Standard protocols were used for small RNA preparation and
Illumina sequencing. In total, 8 721 84-4 clean reads were generated
for the sample. According to the workﬂow, we ﬁltered and
annotated them using currently available databases (Supplementary
Table S2). Massively parallel pyrosequencing generated 11 966 289
non-redundant sequences from the human ovary, and 260 predicted
novel miRNAs were detected (Supplementary Fig. S3A). All the
annotation and analysis were completed in 30 min and the detailed
results are available from CPSS (Download ID = 6818289109).
Second, two samples of small RNA sequencing data from testes
of Sp011 knockout and wild-type mice were tested. Following
the workﬂow, all the small RNA sequences were also ﬁltered and
annotated using CPSS based on the currently available databases,
and the signiﬁcant differentially expressed miRNAs and piRNAs
between the samples were detected and functional analysis for them
was completed (Supplementary Fig. S3B) within 1 h (Download ID
= 713628095). The differential expression of these miRNAs and
piRNAs (these miRNAs and piRNAs expressed differentially based
on both total read counts and most abundant unique tag) was further
validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (details
in Supplementary Methods), and a strong correlation for miRNA
levels was detected between deep sequencing and real-time PCR

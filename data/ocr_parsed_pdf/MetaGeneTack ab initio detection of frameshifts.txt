FragGeneScan while the Sp was >10% higher in both cases.
With the filters, the average Sn and Sp of MetaGeneTack
increased by ~5 percentage points. Similar results were observed
when an FS prediction was reported as a true positive if located
within 10 nt from the simulated FS (data not shown). The
distribution of the distance between predicted FS positions and
true FS positions is shown in Supplementary Figure $1. The
standard deviation is 10.3 and 12.6 for MetaGeneTack and
FragGeneScan, respectively.

4 CONCLUSION

The new software program, MetaGeneTack, addresses the chal—
lenging question of predicting frameshifts in protein—coding re—
gions of metagenomic sequences without extrinsic knowledge.
An advantage of ab initio approach is the ability to detect frame—
shifts in genes of orphan proteins that do not have known homo—
logs. We have shown that the accuracy of MetaGeneTack is
comparable or better than the accuracy of the ab inito gene
prediction tool FragGeneScan. Most of the frameshifts predicted
by MetaGeneTack are supposed to result from sequencing
errors; still like GeneTack, the program is also able to detect
frameshifts caused due to indel mutations and ones related to
recoding (programmed frameshifts involved in gene regulation).
MetaGeneTack could be integrated into pipelines of metage—
nomic sequence annotation.

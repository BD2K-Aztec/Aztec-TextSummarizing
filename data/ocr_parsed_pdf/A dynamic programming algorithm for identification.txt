ABSTRACT

Motivation: Current methods for identification of potential triplex-
forming sequences in genomes and similar sequence sets rely
primarily on detecting homopurine and homopyrimidine tracts.
Procedures capable of detecting sequences supporting imperfect,
but structurally feasible intramolecular triplex structures are needed
for better sequence analysis.

Results: We modified an algorithm for detection of approximate
palindromes, so as to account for the special nature of triplex
DNA structures. From available literature, we conclude that
approximate triplexes tolerate two classes of errors. One, analogical
to mismatches in duplex DNA, involves nucleotides in triplets that
do not readily form Hoogsteen bonds. The other class involves
geometrically incompatible neighboring triplets hindering proper
alignment of strands for optimal hydrogen bonding and stacking.
We tested the statistical properties of the algorithm, as well as
its correctness when confronted with known triplex sequences.
The proposed algorithm satisfactorily detects sequences with
intramolecular triplex-forming potential. Its complexity is directly
comparable to palindrome searching.

Availability: Our implementation of the algorithm is available at
http://www.fi.muni.czflexa/triplex as source code and a web-based
search tool. The source code compiles into a library providing
searching capability to other programs, as well as into a stand-alone
command-line application based on this library.

1 INTRODUCTION

Triplexes are local structural variants of DNA, wherein the molecule
adopts a speciﬁc secondary structure differing from a canonical
duplex by the recruitment of a third DNA strand. The third strand
binds to the duplex by Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen bonds
with stringency of the same order of magnitude as duplex-forming
strands for the most stable nucleotide combinations (reviewed by

Frank-Kamenetskii and Mirkin, 1995). Depending on the source of
the third strand, triplex DNA can be intrastrand and interstrand,
0r intramolecular and intermolecular. The third strand may just
come from the other strand of the same DNA duplex or from a
completely different DNA molecule, as is the case with triplex-
forming oligonucleotides (Knauert and Glazer, 2001). Nucleotides
in the middle strand of a triplex have Watson—Crick base pairing
to one nucleotide and Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen pairing to
another nucleotide. Together they form a triplex-forming triplet
(also called triad) (Mirkin and Frank-Kamenetskii, 1994; Soyfer and
Potaman, 1995). Depending on the orientation of the third strand, we
distinguish parallel and antiparallel triplexes, named according to
the orientation of the third strand in respect to the central strand.
Figure 1 shows eight types of intramolecular triplex structures
considered in this article. A given sequence on the (+) strand of a
DNA molecule can possibly support all eight types, but necessarily,
only one of the types will be formed at any particular moment.
In DNA triplexes, there is a requirement for neighboring triplets
to be isomorphic, otherwise the potential triplet would be under
strain, hindering the binding of the third strand (Rathinavelan and
Yathindra, 2006; Thenmalarchelvi and Yathindra, 2005). Regardless
of orientation and geometry, the middle nucleotide is generally a
purine-containing one, to support the extra hydrogen bonds needed
to bind the third nucleotide.

Because the middle nucleotide is almost invariably one with
a purine base, attempts to correlate sequence with triplex-
forming properties usually involve detection of homopurine and
homopyrimidine tracts in the analyzed sequence. For example,
Gaddis et al. (2006) created a web-based program that identiﬁes
target sequences for triplex-forming oligonucleotides. The program
identiﬁes homopurine stretches that are allowed to be occasionally
interrupted by a pyrimidine. While this is an appropriate method
for detection of strong triplex-forming signals, we consider this
to be an oversimpliﬁcation. Numerous papers have reported the
existence of imperfect triplexes (Mergny et al., 1991; Roberts and
Crothers, 1991; Xodo et al., 1993), including cases where the authors
deliberately Changed individual nucleotides to observe the effects of
such Change. Changes resulting in the formation of non-canonical
triplets did not necessarily disrupt the entire triplex. It is conceivable
that many of the imperfect triplexes may still have similar biological
activity to their ideal counterparts. One possible explanation for the
existence of imperfect triplexes is that they may allow an overlap
between the structural signal and some other sequence feature,

such as nucleosome positioning pattern or a regulatory protein-
binding sequence. Kinniburgh (1989) proposed a triplex structure
containing a single deletion to explain his experimental results.
Additionally, analyzed sequences may contain errors, including
occasional deletions and insertions.

The existence of triplex DNA has been repeatedly associated
with important biological processes at the molecular level, making
them an attractive target in sequence analysis. Most of the observed
associations suggest roles in mutagenesis, recombination and gene
regulation. Non-B DNA structures, including DNA triplexes, have
been shown to cause deletions, expansions and translocations in
both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Raghavan et al., 2005). Their
distribution is not random and often colocalizes with sites of
Chromosomal breakage (Zhao et al., 2010). Triplex structures can
block the replication fork and result in double-stranded breaks
(Dixon et al., 2008). Unlike other non-canonical structures, triplex-
forming sequences are found frequently in promoters and exons
and have been found to be involved in regulating the expression of
several disease-linked genes (Wang and Vasquez, 2004). In some
cases, the mutagenesis induced by such sequences is enhanced
by their transcription (Belotserkovskii et al., 2007), possibly via
transcriptional arrest.

Sequence—structure relationships of triplexes were brought into
a small number of computational tools for identifying relevant
sequences in genome sequences. Schroth and Ho (1995) analyzed
the occurrence of inverted and mirror repeats in three genomes.
Hoyne et al. (2000) analyzed the Escherichia coli genome for
intrastrand triplex sequences. Another recent work (Cer et al., 2010)
created a web-based catalog of non-B DNA sequences in major
mammalian genomes. Their deﬁnition of triplex covers the most
stable canonical triplexes made of G.GC/A.AT and C.GC/T.AT
triplets, but leaves little room for possible errors. Jenjaroenpun and
Kuznetsov (2009) created a web-based analysis tool for triplex target
sequences.

Intramolecular triplex DNA (also called H-DNA) has been shown
to exist both in vivo and in vitro (Hanvey et al., 1988). Its formation
also depends on the topological state of the given DNA molecule.
While sequences supporting canonical triplets, such as (CT(T)),,
and (GA(A)),, tracts, form triplexes readily, imperfect triplexes

may require special conditions, such as low superhelical density
or certain pH to form. In vitro, superhelical density and pH can be
easily controlled. In vivo, pH is tightly controlled by the cell, while
the topological state of any stretch of genomic DNA is generally
unknown, but presumed to be under regulatory control as well. This
uncertainty is the main reason for using the term ‘triplex-forming
sequence’ or ‘triplex-forming potential’, which hints that while the
sequence should be capable of forming a triplex, it may only be
formed under special Circumstances.

2 APPROACH

Based on available literature, we assume there are two important
Classes of sequence-based imperfections (errors) destabilizing
potential triplex structures.

0 Base pairing mismatch

0 Geometrical mismatch

A base pairing mismatch occurs upon the formation of a nucleotide
triplet that does not support strong Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen
bonds. The ability to form the bond and its strength is related to the
number of hydrogen bonds that can be made between the second
and third strand base. In this article, we present an algorithm that
is based on scores assigned to base triplets. The scores are meant
to approximate energy contributions of individual triplets, but at the
same time to be simple enough to support rapid searching that could
be used as pre-ﬁltering, preceding detailed energy calculations on
the candidate sequences.

A geometrical mismatch occurs when directly neighboring
triplets in a structure are not isomorphic. This places extra stress
on the backbone of the third DNA strand preventing it from
creating optimal hydrogen bonds. According to Thenmalarchelvi
and Yathindra (2005), conformational Changes necessitated by
triplet non-isomorphism are found to induce an alternative zig-zag
backbone structure for the third strand in special cases. Accordingly,
we made our algorithm favor triplet combinations that are either
isomorphic or made of non-isomorphic pairs that could form a zig-
zag shape by canceling their geometric effect on the third strand
backbone.

We currently ignore other known factors of triplex DNA
formation, such as the competition between alternative structures
(Rippe et al., 1992), fourth strand (the strand which is not part of
the predicted triplex) secondary structure, effects of C+ distribution
(James et al., 2003; Seidman and Glazer, 2003) and other distortions
caused by electrostatic forces (Kang et al., 1992; Tan and Chen,
2006). Most of these factors depend non-trivially on the environment
(Plum et al., 1995). Since the algorithm does not consider the
environment, we focus primarily on sequence-coded effects and the
resulting constraints which can be computed using the information
from primary structure. Destabilizing effects of loop lengths that
differ from the optimum of about ﬁve nucleotides (Haasnoot et al.,
1986) and the overall length of the triplex (Tan and Chen, 2006) are
partly accounted for, since these parameters can be set as hard limits
in our implementation, to narrow the search space.

3 METHODS

Datasets: to evaluate the algorithm on selected datasets, we prepared a
set of sequences to work with (all ~4.7 Mb to match the size of E.coli

genome): (i) a random nucleotide sequence; (ii) E .coli K-12 MG1655
complete genome (the 1995 U00096.1 version to be able to compare our
results to previous publications); (iii) E .coli K-12 MG1655 complete genome
(the current U00096.2 version for proper positioning in genome browsers);
(iv) a randomized nucleotide sequence of the same E .coli genome; (V) a part
of the human chromosome 5 sequence (positions 144635154149340649)
and (Vi) a randomized version of the same human sequence. For the human
randomized sequence, we also generated a triplex-seeded version with 418
triplex-forming sequences from literature inserted at positions ~10 000 bp
apart. All the sequence data are available as Supplementary Material and can
also be downloaded from http: //wwwﬁ.muni.cz/~lexa/triplex. Random
sequences were generated with equal probability for all four bases, and were
prepared with an in-house algorithm seqmix-0.2 (Supplementary Material).

Molecular simulations of triplets: to obtain objective information about
isomorphic groups, we analyzed the angle and radius formed by C1 atoms of
triplet nucleotides as deﬁned in Thenmalarchelvi and Yathindra (2005). The
groups were determined using the following procedure. First, the structures
of all considered triplets were constructed using the NAB language from
AmberTools 1.4 and their potential energy surface was explored for local
minima by moving and rotating the third (Hoogsteen) base in the plane
formed by the other two bases. The energy function was parametrized using
the ﬂQQbscO set (Perez et al., 2007). The obtained local minima were ﬁltered
according to the values of the C1 angle (t) and the ratio |WH| /|CH|, where
|WH| represents the distance between the C1 atoms of the Hoogsteen pair
and |CH| represents the distance between the C1 atoms of the mutually
unpaired bases. Filtering thresholds were derived from measurements on
a set of real structures, namely the structures 135D, 149D, lBCB, 1D3X
(PDB identiﬁers). The speciﬁc thresholds used were 70 5 t 5 130 and 0.54 5
|WH | / |CH | 5 0.88. From the resulting set of local minima, the structure with
the lowest potential energy was selected as the source of the parameters t
and r (the radius of the circle formed by the C1 atoms). Finally, the groups
were established by performing cluster analysis using Ward’s method and
euclidean distance between the (t,r) vectors. These results were interpreted
to obtain isomorphic groups in Table 1, and detailed results are available as
Supplementary Material.

Testing overview: we tested our implementation for correctness and
usability. Clearly, the algorithm will only be useful, if it is capable of
identifying potential triplex-forming sequences in a genomic background
with a reasonable success rate. To test the implementation in this respect,
we performed statistical tests on real and randomized sequences, a sequence
recovery test on the triplex-seeded sequences, and we compared our solution
to previously published results for the E .coli genome (Hoyne et al., 2000)
and a currently published non-B DNA database (Cer et al., 2010).

Statistical tests: the statistical tests served to ﬁnd parameters for the
distribution of scores on randomized sequences and establish a proper
threshold above which candidate hits should be considered signiﬁcant.
The distribution of scores was modeled according to principles used for
evaluating BLAST results and other sequence similarity scores (Altschul
et al., 1994; Korf et al., 2003), since the alignment of a DNA strand
against itself is statistically similar to aligning two different sequences. This
treatment allowed us to ﬁt the score distribution with an extreme value
distribution function and ﬁt the parameters A and p. as described by Korf et al.
(2003). To carry out the calculation, we used a function from hmmer-2.3.2
source code (Eddy, 1997).

Recovery tests: the recovery tests evaluated how many of the introduced
triplex-forming sequences were recovered for a selected signiﬁcance
threshold (P-Value) from different backgrounds sequences. We used the
commonly used characteristics for such experiments: speciﬁcity (precision),
sensitivity (recall), F 2 measure and accuracy (Manning et al., 2008). The
algorithm was tested against our triplex-seeded sequence and a database of
non-B DNA (Cer et al., 2010).

Additionally, we calculated the genome positioning of program output in
respect to known E .coli genes, counting the frequency with which predicted
triplexes fell inside the gene, outside any genes or intersected with them.
Distance to the closest gene was calculated as shown in Figure 6.

4 THE ALGORITHM

Our approach to search for approximate triplexes is based on a dynamic
programming (DP) algorithm to search for approximate palindromes that
can be traced back to Landau and Vishkin (1986). The relationship between
triplex DNA and palindromes stems from the fact, that one of the DNA
strands in the triplex must fold back onto itself, either for Hoogsteen base
pairing or for reverse Hoogsteen base pairing, depending on the type of
triplex that is to be formed (parallel or antiparallel) and the nucleotide
sequence present at the site in question. We will call the part of the triplex
that folds back onto itself self- recognizing.

A DP matrix is constructed so that one side represents the original
sequence, while the other contains the same sequence written backwards
(Fig. 2). With such setup, the main antidiagonal of the DP matrix represents
the n possible central starting positions for the self-recognizing parts of
triplexes with an odd number of nucleotides in the loop. The neighboring
antidiagonal contains the other n— 1 possible starting sites for the triplexes
with even number of nucleotides in their loops. Naturally, diagonals starting
at any of these positions represent potential triplexes. If we ﬁll the cells
representing the starting positions with zeros, we can start ﬁlling the DP
matrix along the diagonals. At each position [i, j] of the DP matrix, we
compare the symbols at positions i and j in the original sequence. If they
represent a pair present in triplex-forming triplets (tabulated in Table 1), they
are evaluated with positive score. In opposite case, they are penalized with
a negative score value. The numbers entered represent the best score in the
subsequence evaluated so far.

Because of space limitations, loop size was forced to 0. (B) Triplex alignment.

Hoogsteen bonds are shown by semicolons.

The necessity for a dynamic programming algorithm comes from the
possibility to insert gaps into the triplexes, where symbols in some positions
have no symbols to pair up with in the other arm of the self-recognizing
sequence. In terms of the described algorithm, this means moving from one
diagonal to a neighboring one when calculating the score. At any position,
three possibilities are evaluated:

(1) Extending the existing triplex along the diagonal - match or mismatch,
(2) Inserting a gap at position i of the original sequence - insertion,

(3) Inserting a gap at position j of the original sequence - deletion.

The solution that leads to the maximum score value is recorded in the DP
matrix, while the other possibilities are discarded.

In comparison to a similar algorithm for approximate palindrome
detection, we have introduced three important modiﬁcations. First, we
redeﬁned the concept of match and mismatch. Instead of being made up
by pairs of nucleotides with only two possible base pairs, triplexes can
be thought of as sequences of triplets with many possible combinations
of nucleotides in the triplet. There are 16 possible base pairs for parallel
DNA strands and another 16 for antiparallel strands. For these reasons, we
constructed a general similarity matrix instead of using a single match rule
and score.

Second modiﬁcation brings geometrical considerations into the algorithm,
making certain sequences of triplets less desirable than others. This is similar
to the nearest-neighbor scoring used in duplexes, although we are not as
much concerned about base stacking as we are about the geometry of the
third strand and its ability to position itself for optimal hydrogen bonding.
As discussed by Rathinavelan and Yathindra (2006); Thenmalarchelvi and
Yathindra (2005), some combinations disrupt the backbone geometry. We
therefore decided to divide the triplets into isomorphic groups. Groups
of triplets from one group are more likely to form stable triplexes than
other sequences. Our modiﬁcation assigns the information about isomorphic
groups to the last computed DP matrix cell on each diagonal. When
calculating a new cell, we lower the score if the newly evaluated triplet

belongs to a different isomorphic group than the preceding one. The score
calculation is

S[i,j—1]+gp
S[iwj]=max S[i—lvjl+gl7 (1)
S[i—1,j—1]+tts[a,b]+nip

where a, b are characters at appropriate row and column, tss is tabulated
triplet score, gp is gap penalty and nip is no-isomorphism penalty.

The third consideration is to account for all the possible ways a triplex
can form from a given sequence, i.e. which three strands combine together
and in which orientation (Fig. 1). There are always eight ways that can give
rise to a intramolecular triplex at a given position, since there are two strands
that can serve as the third strand, each having two ends that can loop back
onto the double-stranded region and in each of these cases it can attach
on either side of the duplex in a parallel or antiparallel fashion, forming
Hoogsteen and reverse Hoogsteen bonds, respectively. In order to detect
all types of triplexes the computation is repeated eight times with scoring
matrices speciﬁc for parallel and antiparallel triplexes.

4.1 Scoring function

We evaluate the combinations based on their ability to form Hoogsteen
base pairs, tabulating the 32 values as complementarity scores. One way to
populate such table is to consider all canonical triplets to represent a match
and everything else a mismatch. Because the ability to form Hoogsteen bonds
depends partly on the environment of the given nucleotide, we took a semi-
empirical approach, giving all canonical triplets a match score of 2, scanning
triplex literature for examples of less usual triplets and giving those a score
of 1, while all other combinations are scored as a mismatch (Table 1). Other
approaches leading to a better scoring scheme are certainly possible, but
beyond the scope of this article.

4.2 Triplex loop detection

The algorithm introduced in this section has been designed to detect the best
candidates for triplex formation. To avoid the inclusion of free-strand and
loop nucleotides into the overall score for a particular triplex (because these
nucleotides do not participate in WatsoniCrick or Hoogsteen base pairing),
our calculations use a technique composed of a combination of local and
global alignment.

In terms of the DP matrix, potential loops always begin at the main
antidiagonal, extending up to 11mm“, (user-deﬁned algorithm parameter),
using Equation (1) to calculate new values. The ﬁrst 21,001,)“, antidiagonals
are therefore calculated by a technique similar to the one used in Smith7
Waterman local sequence alignment. In this part, we allow the score of a
growing triplex to grow or decline. However, if the density of errors is
high enough to bring the score into the negative territory (potential loop
occurrence), we do not allow the score to become negative.

Once the calculations exit the area of a potential loop, the calculations
continue in a global alignment mode. This way the algorithm can detect
high-quality triplex candidates without considering errors that fall within
potential loops.

4.3 Triplex detection

The best triplexes in the DP matrix can be identiﬁed as those reaching the
highest score. To allow detection of such high scoring segments (HSS)
during the calculation, we use a technique similar to the one used in the
BLAST program. Once the score rises above a preset threshold value, the
region responsible for the score is considered a potential triplex. The score
is monitored (allowed both to increase and decrease) until it falls below a
preset threshold. The sequence from the beginning (the ﬁrst antidiagonal) up
to the maximum score becomes the HSS of the potential triplex (Fig. 3).

A number of ﬁltration mechanisms can be applied to the step of HSS
segment detection. One of the problems we had to deal with (causing false
HSS detection), was the transfer of scores from neighboring diagonals.

In the presence of a high-quality triplex sequence, neighboring diagonals
adopt its high score by introduction of an extra insertion or deletion. We
therefore check for such cases and only report genuine HSS scores and not
the neighboring derivatives.

Further ﬁltration is carried out based on statistical signiﬁcance of the
results, eliminating all short or low-quality potential triplexes below a
user-deﬁned E-Value or P-Value threshold (see Section 5 for details on
P-Value calculations on experimental datasets). A pair of ﬁltering programs
(preﬁlter_gff.c and ﬁlter_gff.c, see Supplementary Material) were used to
ﬁlter out results not supporting a local score maximum (meaning there is a
better result nearby).

4.4 Time and space complexity

Time complexity: the calculation of the entire triangle of the DP matrix
has n2/2 steps. However, when analyzing real or random sequences, the
likelihood of ﬁnding a potential triplex decreases with its length (see section
5 for a detailed description of this effect). Therefore, for most practical
purposes we only need to evaluate a limited number of antidiagonals, say 21,
where l is the maximal length of detected triplexes. Time complexity thus
becomes 0(2ln).

Space complexity: with respect to data dependencies, only the values for
the last two antidiagonals are necessary for calculation. Thus, the space
complexity of our algorithm is 0(2n).

Both simpliﬁcations/efﬁciency enhancements used to derive the time and
space complexities allow us to easily extend the algorithm to perform an
incremental calculation. If upon completion of the calculation we ﬁnd that
the number of antidiagonals was not sufﬁcient, leaving several potential
triplexes unresolved, we can pick up the score values from the last two
diagonals and continue in the calculations in another 21 antidiagonals.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We subjected the algorithm to increasing levels of scrutiny to verify
the validity of our searching procedures, ﬁne-tune some of the
parameters and establish the biological relevance of selected results.

Initial experiments were directed towards establishing reasonable
mismatch and insertion/deletion penalties. The penalties have
to be high enough to allow for a negative average score per
triplet (Korf et al., 2003). Without any rigorous optimization, we
found the combination mismatch —7, insertion or deletion —9,
no_isomorphism —5 to ﬁilﬁll these criteria and work reasonably
well on all sequences.

The threshold shown here for reference purposes is the score above which <10 sequences
were found in randomized data. Precise E-values and P-values can be calculated from
values of A and it according to Equation (2).

Identiﬁcation of a higher number of potential triplexes in real-
world sequences compared with random and randomized sequences
is the ﬁrst conﬁrmation that the patterns we are collecting using this
approach are not random, but rather speciﬁc combinations with a
possible ﬁinction that are less frequent in random sequences.

For a rigorous test of non-randomness of the identiﬁed candidates,
we tested our implementation of the algorithm against a set of 4.7 Mb
DNA sequences from E .coli and human genomes, their randomized
version and a triplex-seeded randomized E .coli genome (see Section
3). For each of the sequences, we used the program to identify
all potential triplexes and their scores. Since an incrementally
detected triplex-forming sequence must obey similar rules as an
incrementally growing sequence alignment (only with different base
pairing rules), we would expect the obtained scores to obey an
extreme value distribution described by Altschul et al. (1994).

We used a maximum likelihood method described by Eddy (1997)
to ﬁt our scores to this function. The resulting values of A and u are
given in Table 2. Figure 4 shows a graphical representation and
corresponding parameter values of triplex scores for the different
datasets used. Clearly, randomized sequences have a lower content
of high-scoring sequence patterns. Also, human sequences seem
to be richer in potential triplex-forming sequences, comparable in
density to the artiﬁcially seeded E .coli sequence with one triplex
sequence per every 10 000 bp.

We used the A and a values to derive statistical thresholds for
searching (Table 2). These are different for parallel and antiparallel
triplexes, since the two use a different similarity matrix, resulting in
different score distributions.

Next, we analyzed the non-B DNA database triplex predictions
(Cer et al., 2010) and our triplex-seeded sequence containing 418
inserted triplexes with artiﬁcial mismatches and insertions. Our
program preferentially recovered the positions of known triplex
sequences. Figure 5 shows sensitivity, speciﬁcity, accuracy and
F 2 measure for these two sets. F measure is the harmonic
mean of sensitivity and speciﬁcity. F2 measure is its commonly
used modiﬁcation, which gives higher priority to recall. F2
measure values >40% are satisfactory, given that 100% of potential
triplexes are recovered with a P-value better than 0.01. Some
loss of performance on triplex-seeded data is understandable, since
mismatches and insertions/deletions were introduced in sequences
as short as 6bp.

One of the detected sequences, is a well-studied triplex
from human metallothionein-I promoter (Bacolla and Wu, 1991).
This sequence was the second highest-scoring sequence in the

sequence, randomized E .coli and human sequences. A maximal likelihood

the human genome seems to be rich in such sequences with density similar

triplex-seeded data, scoring 34 with a P-value of 510—9.
Interestingly, we detected two high-scoring subsequences within the
MT—I promoter potential triplex, supporting the View of Bacolla and
Wu (1991) and Becker and Maher (1998) that alternative triplex
structures may be formed at this speciﬁc site.

For an alternative evaluation of the validity of our algorithm,
we analyzed the E .coli genome for triplex-forming sequences and
compared the results with those described in Hoyne et al. (2000).
They searched for potential intrastrand triplex (PIsT). The PIsT
element requires the consecutive occurrence of all three triplex-
forming blocks of nucleotides, while potential intramolecular triplex
(PImT) element requires the consecutive occurrence of just two
triplex-forming blocks (the third block is provided by the parallel
strand). Thus, every PIsT element by deﬁnition contains also a PImT
element.

For each of the 25 PIsT elements presented in Hoyne et al.
(2000), we are able to identify the corresponding PImT element
in E .coli genome with appropriate parameter settings. The score of
these elements range from the value of 6 to the value of 20 and
the corresponding P-values vary from 4.7 X 10‘1 to 2.9 ><10_6.
The best potential triplex element in E .coli genome found by our
algorithm scored 21 with a P-value of 1.2 X 10T6.

Finally, we examined some of the identiﬁed potential triplex sites
for biological relevance. Producing a GFF ﬁle with results enabled
us to View them in the UCSC Genome Browser. Here, we noticed a
possible relationship to known E .coli genes. To test this, we counted
the number of predicted triplexes falling within genes, outside genes
or <100 bp from gene boundaries (Fig. 7A). We also calculated the
number of predicted triplexes occurring at different distances from
the Closest gene (Fig. 6) and calculated the ratio of this value to
randomly placed positions. There seems to be some preference for
potential triplexes to occur in the —50 to —160 region of known
genes (Fig. 7B). Given the relatively high P-value at which this
effect was still visible, it is possible that it is not directly related
to the presence of triplexes, but rather a result of shared sequence

values was used.

Characteristic between triplexes and regulatory sequences, such as
their underlying palindromic nature.

Another observation showed these positions to be Clustered at
boundaries of evolutionarily poorly conserved regions. A quick
literature search revealed a possible connection. Non-B DNA
structures are likely to pose a physical barrier to transcriptional
apparatus, causing possible transcriptional arrest at such sites (Young
et al., 1991). Transcriptional arrest has been directly linked to
increased mutation rate (Belotserkovskii et al., 2007), which could
explain some aspect of the above-mentioned positioning in genomes.

cutoffs to the results: top 122 (strong triplex), top 1391 (potential triplex),
top 15300 (weak triplex), top 106623 (background) and random selection of
positions (genome).

While the main purpose of this article is to present the algorithm
itself, a more detailed analysis of the best parameter settings and
performance with speciﬁc DNA sequences is needed to further
increase conﬁdence in this kind of sequence analysis.

Because of the increased complexity of scoring, the outlined
procedure for scoring individual triplets within the DP matrix cannot
be easily extended to take advantage of sufﬁx arrays as is done with
palindromes, to further speed up computation.

Overall, we consider it an advantage that triplex identiﬁcation
can be mapped to a well-researched family of DP algorithms and
possibly take advantage of approaches aimed originally at other
problems, such as sequence alignment.

6 CONCLUSON

We present a novel approach to identifying triplex-forming
sequences in genomes and other DNA sequence data. The
approach is presented in the form of an algorithm based on
previously published algorithms for detection of palindromes. The
novelty stems from the adaptation of DP for use with triplexes

instead of relying on simpler identiﬁcation of homopurine and
homopyrimidine tracts, which are most appropriate for detection
of perfect triplexes. We implemented our algorithm as a program
written in C, using a reasonable set of parameters based on published
data. The test runs of this program are encouraging, suggesting
that the algorithm can provide high speed searches with increased
sensitivity for approximate triplex-forming sequences.

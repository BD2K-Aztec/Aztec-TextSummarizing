Fast local similarity statistical significance approximation

 

permutations are needed for estimating P—values that were used for
Q—value calculation. A fast and efﬁcient theoretical approximation
for the statistical signiﬁcance of the LS score is urgently needed.
Recently, Durno et a]. (2013) provided an upper bound for the
p—value corresponding to a LS score. However, the upper bound
is not tight.

We make the following contributions in this article. First,
Feller (1951) developed an approximation theory for the range
of partial sums for independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)
random variables with mean zero, and Daudin et a]. (2003)
extended the results to Markovian random variables. Although
the theory developed by Feller (1951) was later further extended
by others, it has not been applied to the field of computational
biology. We are the ﬁrst to use Feller’s theory to approximate the
distribution of LS scores. On the other hand, the theory corres—
ponding to the scenario that the expectation of each random
variable is negative was used by Karlin et a]. (1990) and Karlin
and Altschul (1993) to derive the statistical signiﬁcance for local
sequence alignment. Such a development was crucial for the wide
use of BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) in computational biological
research.

Second, the theory by Feller (1951) and others are valid only
when the number of summands (time points) is large. However,
it is not clear how large the number of time points should be so
that the approximation is reasonable for the LS score. We show
through simulations that the approximation from Feller (1951) is
reasonable as long as the number of time points is at least 10 for
LS score without time delay. In addition, we show how we can
adapt Feller’s approximation to calculate statistical signiﬁcance
of LS score with time delays. Simulations showed that the result—
ing approximation is appropriate when the number of time
points is above 20. Finally, we applied the developed theory to
the analysis of real datasets from gene expression proﬁles to
metagenomics communities, where interesting biological results
were obtained.

The organization of the article is as follows. In the ‘Methods’
section, we provide the theoretical bases for deriving the approxi—
mate tail probability that the LS score is above a threshold. In
the ‘Results’ section, we use simulations to study the number of
data points 11 needed for the theoretical approximation to be
valid. We also use the theoretical formula to study three real
datasets arising from different high—throughput experiments:
microarray, molecular ﬁnger printing and NGS tag—sequencing.
The article concludes with some discussion on further applica—
tions and future research directions.

2 METHODS
Consider time series data for two factors with levels X1, X2, - - - ,X,, and
Y1, Y2, - - - , Y", respectively. The ﬁrst step is to normalize the expression

levels of each time series so that they can be regarded as normally dis-
tributed. Without loss of generality, we assume that they are already
normally distributed. Second, dynamic programming algorithm is used
to ﬁnd intervals I = [i, i + l — 1] and J = [j,j + l — 1] of the same length I
such that the absolute value of S =  X HA. YHA. is maximized, which is
referred to as local similarity (LS) score (Qian et al., 2001; Ruan et al.,
2006; Xia et al., 2011b). Here the starting positions of the subintervals i
and j, and the length of the intervals I are not pre-speciﬁed and are all
derived from the data. In most practical problems, investigators may only

be interested in local associations with short delays, for example, the
starting positions of the intervals in the two time series i and j are
at most D units apart, i.e. |i—j| 5 D. We denote the LS score with
time delay at most D units by LS(D).

In the third step, statistical signiﬁcance for the LS score corresponding
to the null hypothesis that the two factors are not associated is approxi-
mated by permuting one of the time series data many times and calculat-
ing the fraction of times that the LS score for the permuted data is higher
than that for the real data (Qian et al., 2001; Ruan et al., 2006). With such
a permutation approach for P-value, the authors implicitly assumed that
the observations for the samples at the different time points are independ-
ent under the null model. However, in many practical problems, in par-
ticular, time series data, the observations for each factor may depend on
each other and the permutation-based approach may not work well.
Another drawback of the permutation-based approach is that computa-
tional time scales linearly with the inverse of the P-value precision and is
computationally expensive for large dataset of long series. Here, we pro-
vide theoretical formulas to approximate the P-value overcoming both
problems.

2.1 Maximum absolute partial sums of i.i.d. and
Markovian random variables

To derive theoretical formulas to approximate the P-value related to the
local similarity score, we resort to classical theoretical studies on the range
of partial sums for i.i.d. random variables with zero mean (Feller, 1951).
The results from such studies when the expectation of the random vari-
ables is negative played key roles in the derivation of statistical signiﬁ-
cance for local sequence alignment, e.g. BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990),
which forms a milestone in the ﬁeld of computational biology (Karlin
et al., 1990; Karlin and Altschul, 1993). On the other hand, the theoretical
results on the approximate distributions when the mean is zero have not
been used in the computational biology community.

Based on these previous theoretical studies, we present some theoret-
ical results regarding the range of partial sums for either i.i.d. or
Markovian random variables. Feller (1951) studied the approximate dis-
tribution of the range of the sum of n random variables with mean 0. Let
Z,» be i.i.d. random variables such that E(Z,») = 0 and Var(Z,») = :72. Let

Snzzl+ZZ+“‘+Zm anmaxioaslasla“‘asn}a and
m,, = min {0, 51,52, ---, S,,}. The range is deﬁned as R,, = M" — m,,. It
is shown in Feller (1951): E(R,,/a) = 2x/2n/rr,

Var(R,,/a) = 4n(log(2) — 2/71).

Using the theory of Bachelier7Wiener processes, Feller (1951) approxi-
mated the density function of Rn/a by (equations 3.7 and 3.8 in that
article) 8(n; r),

6(n; r) = grin/(2m), (1)
where,
L(z) = £524 i exp(—(2k + 1)27r2/822). (2)
[:0
Thus,

“Rn/(ma) Z x) =  ﬁrel L<ﬁ>dp

°° 1 1 (2k + 1)27'[2
_ 1 _ 8  (E + (2k +1)2n2)exp<— 2x2 '

Since the summation in equation 3 is an inﬁnite sum, we need to
decide when to stop for numerical approximations. To achieve this
objective, we next give an upper bound for the tail in equation (3).

Fast local similarity statistical significance approximation

 

2.3 Dealing with replicates

To reduce the effect of biological and/or technical variation on the LSA
results, replicate experiments are frequently carried out (Quinn and
Keough, 2002). An extended LSA (eLSA) approach was developed for
time series data with replicates (Xia et al., 2011b). First, for each sample
the replicate data at each time point were summarized by a function, for
example, the average over the replicates. Second, the local similarity score
is calculated using the averages for the sample pairs. Third, statistical
signiﬁcance for testing the hypothesis that the two sequences are related
is obtained by randomly shufﬂing the data along the different time points.
Finally, the bootstrap conﬁdence interval for the LS score is obtained by
bootstrapping the data at each time point by sampling from the observed
data with replacement.

With the theory developed above, we can signiﬁcantly speed up the
process of evaluating the statistical signiﬁcance of the LS score in the
third step. Let X('") = (Xgm), - - - ,Xﬁlml) and Y0") = (ng), - - - , YEW) be the
m-th replicate for the time series data, m = 1, 2, - - - ,M. The essence of
eLSA is to calculate the local similarity score of U,» = F(XEI), - - - , X9“)
and V,» = F(YEI), - - - , YEW), where F(-) is the summarizing function. Then
by replacing X and Y in non-replicated case with U and V, respectively,
similar approaches can be used to obtain the P-value. In particular, if

U,» = F(XEI), - - - ,XEM)) =  = 21:14:, XEM/M and all the X?” are stand-
ard normal, then Var(U,») = l/M. Similarly, we have Var( V,») = l/M
assuming that each of the XE'") is already standard normal. Thus,
:72 = Var(U,»V,») = 1 /M2. Let the local similarity score with time delay at
most D for the real data be SD. Then the P-value is calculated by

P(LS(D) 2 so)
_ M>< LS(D)
— (T

2 M x saw) (12)
= £(M >< SD/x/ﬁ),

where the function ﬂ is deﬁned in equation (10).

2.4 Data normalization

In reality, normality may not be satisﬁed by the raw data. Through nor-
malization, the normality of the data can be ensured for subsequent ana-
lysis. To accommodate possible nonlinear associations and the variation
of scales within the raw data, we apply the following approach to nor-
malize the raw data before any LS score calculations as described in Li
(2002). We use X,» to denote the original raw data of the i-th time spot of a
factor X. First, we take 17, 2 rank of X), in {X1, X2, ..., X,,}. Then, we take
SA» 2 <I>’1(r;,/n + 1), where (D is the cumulative distribution function of
the standard normal distribution.

In case of small n, we ﬁnd that the above transformed data S = SUM]
do not necessarily follow a standard normal distribution closely. When
the variance is not 1 and mean is not zero, it will cause the LS scores
calculated to be smaller than that expected from the theory and can lead
to unexpected high P-values. To overcome this difﬁculty, we further scale
and shift S = SUM] using the Z-score transformation, such that
z,» = s,» — S /aS. We will take Z = z[1,,,] as the standardized normalization
of X.

2.5 Simulation studies and applications to real datasets

In deriving the approximate P-values for local similarity analysis in sub-
section 2.2, we made several simplifying assumptions, whose effects on
the accuracy of the approximations were evaluated by simulations. We
ﬁrst study the accuracy of the approximation for the tail probability of
Rn/(aﬁ) in equation (10) using simulations for local similarity analysis.
Firstly, for given number of time points n, we generate n pairs of i.i.d.
standard normal random variables (X ,», Y,»), i = 1, 2, - - - , n, where X,» and

Y,» are independent. Secondly, the dynamic programming algorithm im-
plemented in eLSA (Xia et al., 2011b) package is used to calculate the
local similarity score with at most time delay D, LS(D). Thirdly, we
repeat the ﬁrst two steps 10,000 times and obtain the empirical distribu-
tion of LS(D)/(aﬂ). We compare the empirical distributions with the
theoretical approximation given in equation (10) with a = 1.

We then apply our method to analyze three real datasets. The ﬁrst one
is a microarray yeast gene expression dataset, synchronized by the cdc-15
gene, from Spellman et al. (1998) (referred to as ‘CDC’). The second one
is an ARISA molecular ﬁnger printing microbial ecology dataset from
San Pedro Ocean Time Series in Steele et al. (2011) (referred to as
‘SPOT’). The third one is a 16S RNA tag-sequencing dataset from the
‘Moving Pictures of Human’ sampling of human symbiotic microbial
communities from Caporaso et al. (2011) (referred to as ‘MPH’). We
apply local similarity analysis to re-analyze the ﬁrst two datasets and
compare the theoretical and permutation p-values. We are the ﬁrst to
analyze the third dataset using local similarity analysis.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulations

The approximate P—value for the local similarity score given in
subsection 2.2 is only applicable when the P—value is small and
the number of time points is large. Thus, it is important to know
the range of applicability for the approximation. Table 1
gives the theoretical tail probability based on equation (10)
(2nd column) and the simulated probability P(LS(0)/ﬁ 3 x)
(3rd to 9th columns) for different number of time points when
D = 0. It can be seen that the theoretical tail probability is very
close to the simulated probability when the theoretical P—value is
less than 0.01. The approximation is even reasonable when the
number of time points is just 10. In general, the theoretical tail
probability is slightly larger than the simulated values when
D = 0 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). When
D = 1,2,3, the theoretical approximation is close to the simu—
lated tail probability when n 3 20 and the theoretical P—value is
less than 0.01 (for D = 3 see Table 2 and also see Supplementary
Tables S27S4 in Supplementary Results). Thus, if we use the
theoretical approximate distribution to calculate the P—value,
we will be slightly conservative in declaring signiﬁcant
associations.

For relatively small value of x, the theoretical approximation
can be much larger than the simulated tail probability.
One potential explanation is that REP/(m/ﬁ) is stochastically
increasing with respect to n and that the theoretical approxima—
tion becomes closer to the simulated distribution of
LS(D)/(aﬁ) as 11 increases. We also tested if
P(LS(D)/(a@ 3 x) = 1 — (1 — F(Rgm/(m/ﬁ) 3 x))2D+l is gen—
erally true using the simulated tail probabilities in Figure 1, and
it can be clearly seen from Supplementary Tables S17S4 that this
relationship is indeed reasonable, indicating that
Sylld = 0, :l: 1, ---:|: D can effectively be considered as
independent.

In equation (11), we derive the approximate density function
of REM/(m/ﬁ). We superimpose this approximate density func—
tion to the histograms of the simulated LS(D)/(aﬁ) at n = 200
and D = 0, 1, 2, 3 in Figure 1. Several observations can be made
from the figure. First, the values of LS(D)/(aﬁ) increase as a
function of D as expected. Second, the approximate theoretical

Note: The theoretical approximate probability based on equation (10) with a = 1 is given in the 2nd column and the simulated probability that LS(D)/\/ﬁ 3 x is given in the

3rd to the 9th columns. D = 0.

density function is slightly lower than the simulated frequency
when x is lower than the mode of the theoretical distribution and
is slightly higher than the simulated frequency when x is larger
than the mode of the theoretical distribution, thus the tail prob—
ability based on the theoretical approximation is slightly higher
than the simulated value.

We next see how P—values (Pym) derived from theoretical
approximation compare with that of permutation (Pperm) given
the same data (Supplementary Figure S1) in simulation. Starting
from D = 0 and n = 20, points in scatter plots become concen—
trated on the diagonal line (where PM”, = Pym) and they become
more aligned as 11 increases. This indicates an increasing rate of
agreement between the theoretical and permutation P—values,
representing their reasonable approximation to the null distribu—
tion in spite of the inherent variance associated with the permu—
tation procedures. The same is true with D>0, and the
theoretical approximation become signiﬁcantly closer to the
permutation one as 11 increase. Though, when D>0, the vari—
ation seems more substantial and close alignment only starts at
n = 30. In summary, we can see that if we are interested in stat—
istical signiﬁcance given some type I error threshold, the theor—
etical approach shall provide results comparable with that from
permutations starting from n = 20.

3.2 The CDC dataset

The CDC dataset consists of the expression proﬁles of 6177
genes at 24 time points. It is extremely time consuming to
approximate the P—values for all the gene pairs using permuta—
tions. Thus, we only randomly selected 25 genes and estimated
the P—value for each of the 300 gene pairs by permuting the
original data 1000 times. We then compared ngos from our
theoretical approximation to Ppéms from the permutation
approach, shown in Figure 2. It can be seen from the ﬁgure
that Pﬁm is highly positively correlated with Pmrm, but PM“ is

slightly higher than Ppem, indicating that it is conservative when
we declare statistical signiﬁcance using PM“.

In particular, we compare the gene pairs declared as significant
by either PM“, or PM”, for the type—I error threshold 0.05 in
Supplementary Table S5. For all the situations considered,
none of PWO is less than 0.05 when Ppe,.m>0.05. Among the
gene pairs with Ppm, g 0.05, over half of them are declared as
significant by Pym. For the local similarity analysis, using D = 0,
we have 233 (78%) out of 300 found to be non—significant by
both theoretical approximation and permutations. Among the
remaining, 48 (16%) are found signiﬁcant by both methods,
and in total 281 (94%) are in agreement. The results are similar
with D: 1,2,3, with 262 (88%), 262 (88%) and 262 (88%) in
agreement, respectively. Moreover, all—to—all pairwise analysis
of the whole CDC dataset with D23 and permutation 1000
times cannot be completed in 100 hours on a ‘Dell, PE1950,
Xeon E5420, 2.5GHz, 12010 MB RAM’ computing node,
while, using the theoretical approach, it finishes in 10 hours on
the same node.

3.3 The SPOT dataset

The SPOT dataset consists of 10—year monthly (114 time points)
sampled operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance data.
As above, we selected 40 abundant OTUs from the SPOT dataset
with the criteria ‘the OTU occurs at least 20 times with minimum
relative abundance 1% and has less than 10 missing values’. We
summarize P—value comparison for local similarity analysis in
Supplementary Table S6 and Figure 2.

With D = 0 and type—I error 0.05, we have 488 (63%) out of
780 found non—signiﬁcant and 261 (33%) signiﬁcant by both
methods. In total, 685 (96%) are in agreement. All of the remain—
ing 31 (4%) pairs are significant by PM”, but non—signiﬁcant by
PM“. The results are similar with D: 1,2,3, where 733 (94%),
723 (93 %) and 727 (93%) are in concordance, respectively. There

ﬁgﬁ‘ﬂiﬁ'l, which is two times the number of shared associations

divided by the sum of number associations in each sample.
The index ranges from 0 to 1 and is higher for community
with more similar associations.

We found ‘F4’ and ‘M3’ shared 129 pairs of their signiﬁcant
local associations (Q, : 0.57) in feces samples. These are mostly
associations between the Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae,
Erysipelotrichaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Veillonellaceae
family members. At tongue and right palm sites, 192 pairs
(Qs=0.59) and 5387 pairs (Qs=0.4) local associations were
shared, respectively. On the other hand, signiﬁcant local associ—
ations are not always shared in large number between different
sites even within one person. Only 2 pairs (Qs=0.18) were
shared between the feces and tongue sites for ‘F4’ while 22
pairs (Q,,:0.48) for ‘M3’. However, owing to the small
number of total shared OTUs between the two sites, the
Sorensen indices were not low. In addition, compared with
‘F4’, ‘M3’ generally has a more similar microbiota across body
sites, since, between the feces and palm sites for ‘M3’, 245 pairs
were shared (Q: = 0.75) and between tongue and palm sites 605
pairs were shared (Q, : 0.67), while, between the feces and palm
sites for ‘F4’, only 34 pairs were shared (Q; = 0.37) and between
tongue and palm sites only 73 pairs were shared (Q = 0.4).

Among the signiﬁcant local associations we found, many of
them are time—delayed local associations. For example, in the
‘F4’ feces sample, the global proﬁles Coprococcus and
Escherichia are not significantly correlated by PCC
(r: —0.1708, P:0.0521) while significantly by eLSA
(LS:—0.3179, P : 0.0002). The association is signiﬁcantly
negative for 126 consecutive time points, where Coprococcus
leads Escherichia by 3 days. Hinted by this, shifting the
Coprococcus proﬁle by 3 days backward, we see their global
profile are signiﬁcantly negatively correlated (r: —0.3314,
P: 0.0001) (Supplementary Figure S2). As another example, in
the ‘F4’ feces sample, Eubacterium and Oscillospira are not sig—
niﬁcantly correlated by PCC (r:0.1313, P:0.1364), however,
signiﬁcantly associated for 122 consecutive time points by eLSA
(LS : 0.3862, P: 0.0001), where the former leads the later by 2
days in the co—occurrence. Hinted by this, shifting the
Eubacterium proﬁle by 2 days backward, we see they actually
are also globally signiﬁcantly correlated (r : 0.3525, P: 0.0001)
(Supplementary Figure S2).

 

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we provide theoretical formulas to approximate
the statistical signiﬁcance of local similarity analysis for time
series data, which make it possible to evaluate the P—values of
comparisons of time series data for a large number of factors
such as genes in gene expression analysis or OTUs in metage—
nomic studies, originally impractical to carry out using the per—
mutation—based approach. The theoretical approximation is
mathematically sound with speciﬁed assumptions of data distri—
butions verifiable before the analysis. The permutation test, how—
ever, heavily depends on data—speciﬁc empirical distributions and
can be biased by the numerical properties of speciﬁc data as well
as its intrinsic variability.

In addition, if we are interested in the tail distribution as in
most applications, the permutation and theoretical methods are

mostly in agreement with each other in predictions given the
same type—I error threshold. We have results from setting thresh—
old to lower values (0.01, 0.005, 0.001, etc.) showing high overall
agreement rate (data not shown). Therefore, from the practical
point of view, we can substitute permutations with the theoretical
method in such applications. Moreover, from the simulations
and our real analysis, PM“ is more conservative than PWmia
property particularly useful in biological applications prone to
substantial number of false positives, such as the microarray
analysis (Pawitan et al., 2005).

The most important reason for us to embrace the
theoretical method is computational efﬁciency. As shown in
Xia et al. (2011b), for a given type—I error, a, the time complexity
of computing Pprem, is 0(DMN/Oi), where D is the delay limit, N
is the sample number and M the replicate number. With Pym, we
may compute and store (LS score, P—value) pairs into a hash
table, before any pairwise comparison. Then, for each compari—
son, it only costs constant time 0(1) to read out PM“, and is
independent of D, M, N and a, a strongly desired feature for
large scale analysis. The superiority of efﬁciency is evident from
Supplementary Figure S3, in which, the averaged time cost of
analysing four sets of 40 factors, 114 time points series was
compared between theoretical approach and 1000 times permu—
tation. The per—pair time cost is about 40 seconds for PM”, while
negligible for PM“ and is independent of sample size, which is a
big saver of computing resource, energy and research time.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The recent advent of high—throughput technologies made possible
large scale time—resolved omics studies (proteomics, transcrip—
tomics, metagenomics), tracking hundreds, thousands or even
tens of thousands of molecules simultaneously. Time—series gen—
erated from these studies provide an invaluable opportunity to
investigate the varying dynamics of biological systems.
However, to make full use of huge datasets, accurate and efﬁcient
statistical and computational methods are urgently needed at all
levels of analysis, from accurate estimation of abundance and ex—
pression levels, to pairwise association and network analysis.

The theoretical statistical signiﬁcance approximation we pro—
posed in this work can serve as an efﬁcient alternative for calcu—
lating P—values in local similarity analysis. Its time cost is always
constant, which reduces the computational burden in a large
scale pairwise analysis. For example, in metagenomics, after
short read assignment and abundance estimation (Xia et al.,
2011a; He and Xia, 2007), proﬁles of thousands of microbial
OTUs are available. Before this work, pairwise local association
analysis with this number of factors was hardly tractable using
permutation procedures, if not impossible. Parallel computation
and hardware acceleration or some pre—clustering and ﬁltering
approaches were required, increasing the difﬁculty of analysis.
With the new method, researchers can quickly compute the stat—
istical significance for all OTU pairs on desktop computers,
allowing on—the—ﬂy network mining and analysis.

After analysing the MPH dataset with the new method, we
found body—site—speciﬁc human microbiota core OTUs are
highly coordinated. There exist robust site—speciﬁc associations
across individuals. We implemented the new method in the eLSA
package (Xia et al., 2011b), which now provides faster pipelines

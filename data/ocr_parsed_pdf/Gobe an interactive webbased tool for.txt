ABSTRACT

Summary: Gobe is a web-based tool for viewing comparative
genomic data. It supports viewing multiple genomic regions
simultaneously. Its simple text format and flash-based rendering
make it an interactive, exploratory research tool. Gobe can be used
without installation through our web service, or downloaded and
customized with stylesheets and javascript callback functions.
Availability: Gobe is a flash application that runs in all modern
web-browsers. The full source-code, including that for the online
web application is available under the MIT license at: http://github
.com/brentp/gobe. Sample applications are hosted at http://try-gobe
.appspot.com/ and http://synteny.cnr.berkeley.edu/gobe-app/.

1 INTRODUCTION

As more genomic data and data formats are created, there is an
increasing demand for a tool that accepts a simple text-based
format and renders an interactive view of the data that can then be
used to develop hypotheses and convey information. A web-based
application has the advantage of being more accessible and easily
deployable, allowing users to quickly visualize and share data.

Existing genome visualization tools such as GBrowse (Stein et (11.,
2002), GenomeGraphs (Durian et (11., 2009) and genoPlotR (Guy
et (11., 2010) generate useful static images but require installation, use
in a speciﬁc programming language environment and do not provide
interactivity. Browsers such as Anno-J (http://www.annoj.org) and
the UCSC genome browser (Kent et (11., 2002) are interactive but
more difﬁcult to set up and do not easily support comparison
of multiple genomic regions. Other stand-alone viewers such as
GenomeView (http://genomeview.org/) and Tablet (Milne et (11.,
2009) excel in displaying next-generation sequence data but are less
customizable. While tools such as VISTA (Frazer et (11., 2004) do
offer a comparative View, deletions, inversions and transpositions
are not visible given that representation.

We introduce Gobe, a customizable, language-agnostic tool that
can be run locally or used from an existing web-service. In either
case, all data and styling are speciﬁed through a simple text format.
Optional javascript callbacks allow interactivity for web developers.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Installation and customization

Though most users will be unaffected by implementation details,
Gobe is implemented in HaXe (http://haxe.org), an open source
programming language that compiles to the ﬂash platform
(http://www.adobe.com/software/ﬂash/about/). Because ﬂash is
already installed in most web browsers, it will run for most users
without installation. We have found that ﬂash provides a balance
of performance, interactivity and availability (Gobe requires ﬂash
version 9) that is hard to match with other technologies such as
HTMLS and Java. We provide the HaXe source code for those
wishing to modify the application itself.

Gobe represents multiple genomic regions as rows or tracks in
the ﬂash movie. A track can contain genomic features, text labels
and line or histogram plots of numerical data. Gobe can render
alignments between genomic regions as high-scoring sequence pairs
(often called HSPs in BLAST-like alignment outputs) as wedges
connecting the regions of sequence similarities. This helps to study
the extents of sequence conservation or genomic rearrangements
(see example in Fig. 1).

Mouse actions, such as clicks, on genomic features in the ﬂash
movie will send callbacks to a javascript function. This allows
further interactivity and customization. For example, a developer
may run their own installation of Gobe that would override the
javascript callback to retrieve and display detailed information for

a feature when it is clicked as is done on the http://synteny.cnr
.berkeley.edu/gobe-app/site.

Each genomic feature that is displayed in Gobe has an associated
feature type (exon, intron, mRNA, transposon, etc.). The feature type
is used to look up the rendering style in a stylesheet. For example,
the type of ‘mRNA’ may have a height of 0.6, a color of green
and an arrow shape to illustrate its transcriptional orientation. In
addition to the type-based speciﬁcation of style, one is also able to
have per-feature color in the input ﬁle, which allows highlighting a
speciﬁc feature of interest. A user may provide her own stylesheet
to customize the look of features in a particular application.

2.2 Data formats

Gobe uses a comma-separated format with ﬁve required columns:
arbitrary id, track-id, start, end and feature-type. Further optional
columns may indicate strand, name and special color (see ﬁill
speciﬁcation at http://github.com/brentp/gobe). Consecutive lines
with type ‘HSP’ are linked so that when clicked, a wedge
is drawn between them. This format has the advantage of
consistency and brevity while allowing simple speciﬁcation of
pair relationships between features. We include scripts to convert
from other popular formats such as BED (http://genome.ucsc.edu/
FAQ/FAQformat#formatl), GFF3 (http://www.sequenceontology
.org/gff3.shtml) and tab-delimited BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997)
to the Gobe input format.

3 USAGE

When viewing orthologous regions, it is useful to have an interactive
view that shows regions of similarity represented as HSPs. Figure 1
displays a comparative view of orthologous regions in three grass
genomes—brachypodium, sorghum and rice. Each track (title on the
left) contains annotated genes (light-gray) and exons (green) drawn
in the center of each panel. HSPs are drawn either above or below
the annotations, depending on their orientation. In Figure 1, orange,
green and dark-brown HSP boxes indicate rice—sorghum, sorghum—
brachypodium and rice—brachypodium pairs, respectively. When an
HSP is clicked in the viewer, a semi-transparent wedge is drawn to
connect the pairs.

In this example, the HSPs occur in the same order among
homologs, suggesting that gene structure is well conserved since
these three organisms diverged. The connector wedges in Figure l
highlight a region in sorghum where there is likely an unannotated
exon, as evidenced by regions of similarity covering exons in both
rice and brachypodium. Other non-genic regions of similarity are
conserved non-coding sequences—candidate regulatory sites.

4 WEB SERVICE

As an example usage of Gobe, we provide a ﬁilly ﬁinctional,
open-source web service backed by python scripts and hosted

on Google App-Engine. This service is available at http://try-
gobe.appspot.com/ and allows users to paste in their own genomic
data, view the resulting interactive ﬂash movie, make changes to
past views and provide a link to that speciﬁc set of annotations. All
results are retained on the server and accessible through a unique
URL.

The site also contains a panel with links to example datasets
exemplifying Gobe use in rendering comparative datasets, a dataset
with next-generation sequencing data, and one showing the use of
line and histogram data for displaying Guanine-Cytosine content.

We have also created an additional example application
that implements dynamic panning, zooming and reverse-
complementation here: http://synteny.cnr.berkeley.edu/gobe-app/.
This application also shows the sequence alignment for each HSP
as it is clicked.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have created a visualization tool that relies on text input to
specify the way the features are drawn and how they are related.
It provides a means of comparing up to (a practical limit of) about
10 related genomic regions and visualizing associated numerical
data. Gobe can be customized to offer further interactivity. This tool
provides the basis for custom applications that utilize orthology and
numerical data to reveal more about a region of interest. We have
created two web sites that demonstrate some of the possibilities of
using Gobe to create custom applications.

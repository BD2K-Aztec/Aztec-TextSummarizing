ABSTRACT

Motivation: The sequence alignment/map format (SAM) is a
commonly used format to store the alignments between millions
of short reads and a reference genome. Often certain positions
within the reads are inherently more likely to contain errors due
to the protocols used to prepare the samples. Such biases can
have adverse effects on both mapping rate and accuracy. To
understand the relationship between potential protocol biases and
poor mapping we wrote SAMstat, a simple C program plotting
nucleotide overrepresentation and other statistics in mapped and
unmapped reads in a concise html page. Collecting such statistics
also makes it easy to highlight problems in the data processing and
enables non-experts to track data quality over time.

Results: We demonstrate that studying sequence features in
mapped data can be used to identify biases particular to one
sequencing protocol. Once identified, such biases can be considered
in the downstream analysis or even be removed by read trimming or
filtering techniques.

Availability: SAMStat is open source and freely available as a C
program running on all Unix-compatible platforms. The source code
is available from http://samstat.sourceforge.net.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next generation sequencing is being applied to understand
individual variation, the RNA output of a cell and epigenetic
regulation. Not surprisingly, the mapping of short reads to the
genome has received a lot of attention with over 30 programs
published to date [see Trapnell and Salzberg (2009) for a review
of the most commonly used approaches]. Nevertheless, commonly
a noticeable fraction of reads remains unmatched to the reference
genome in each experiment. One possibility is that these reads
simply represent the fraction of reads containing more sequencing
errors in the form of mismatches, insertions or deletions than the
programs can handle. Alternatively, it is conceivable that these reads
contain contaminants and therefore do not map to the expected
reference sequence. Finally, the unmapped reads may represent
novel splice junctions or genomic regions absent from the reference
assembly. Understanding the reason behind obtaining unmapped
reads is clearly of interest.

Mapping programs like MAQ (Li et al., 2008) and BWA
(Li and Durbin, 2009) report mapping qualities allowing for
further investigation. We wrote SAMstat to contrast properties

of unmapped, poorly mapped and accurately mapped reads to
understand whether particular properties of the reads inﬂuence the
mapping accuracy. As the name suggests, our program is designed
to work mainly with SAM/BAM ﬁles (Li et al., 2009) but also not
only can be used to visualize nucleotide composition and other basic
statistics of fasta and fastq (Cock et al., 2009) ﬁles.

2 METHODS

SAMStat automatically recognizes the input ﬁles as either fasta, fastq, SAM
or BAM and reports several basic properties of the sequences as listed
in Table 1. Multiple input ﬁles can be given for batch processing. For
each dataset, the output consists of a single htmlS page containing several
plots allowing non-specialists to Visually inspect the results. Naturally, the
htmlS pages can be Viewed both on- and off-line and easily be stored
for future reference. All properties are plotted separately for different
mapping quality intervals if those are present in the input ﬁle. For example,
mismatch proﬁles are given for high-and low-quality alignments allowing
users to verify whether poorly mapped reads contain a speciﬁc collection
of mismatches. The latter may represent untrimmed linkers in a subset of
reads. Dinucleotide overrepresentation is calculated as described by Frith
et al. (2008). Overrepresented lOmers are calculated by comparing the
frequency of lOmer within a mapping quality interval compared with the
overall frequency of the lOmer.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To demonstrate how SAMStat can be used to visualize mapping
properties of a next generation datasets, we used data from a
recently published transcriptome study (Plessy et al., 2010); (DDBJ
short read archive: DRA000169). We mapped all 24 million 5’
reads to the human genome (GRCh37/hgl9 assembly) using BWA
(Li and Durbin, 2009) with default parameters. SAMStat parsed the
alignment information in ~3 min which is comparable to the 2 min
it takes to copy the SAM ﬁle from one directory to another. The
majority of reads can be mapped with very high conﬁdence (Fig. la).
When inspecting the mismatch error proﬁles, we noticed that there

are many mismatches involving a guanine residue at the very start
of many reads (yellow bars in Fig. lb—e). These 5’ added guanine
residues are known to originate from the reverse transcriptase step
in preparing the cDNAs (Carninci et al., 2006). When comparing
the mismatch proﬁles for high (Fig. lb) to low-quality alignments
(Fig. 1e), it is clear that a proportion of reads contain multiple

5’ added G’s which in turn pose a problem to the mapping. For
example, at the lowest mapping quality (Fig. 1e), there are frequent
mismatches involving G’s at positions one, two and to a lesser extent
until position ﬁve while in high-quality alignments the mismatches
are conﬁned to the ﬁrst position of the reads (Fig. lb).

Alongside the mismatch proﬁles SAMstat gives a table listing the
percentages of each dinucleotide at each position of the reads split
up by mapping quality intervals (Fig. 1f). For the present dataset,
60.4% of unmapped reads start with ‘GG’ and 10.1 percent contain a
‘GG’ at position 4. Evidently, 5’ G residues are added during library
preparation and the start positions of mappings should be adjusted
accordingly.

SAMStat is ideally suited to deal with the ever increasing amounts
of data from second-and third-generation sequencing projects.
Speciﬁc applications include the veriﬁcation and quality control
of processing pipelines, the tracking of data quality over time and
the visualization of data properties derived from new protocols and
approaches which in turn often leads to novel insights.

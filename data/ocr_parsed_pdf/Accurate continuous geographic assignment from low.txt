Abstract

Motivation: Large—scale genotype datasets can help track the dispersal patterns of epidemiological
outbreaks and predict the geographic origins of individuals. Such genetically—based geographic
assignments also show a range of possible applications in forensics for profiling both victims and
criminals, and in wildlife management, where poaching hotspot areas can be located. They,
however, require fast and accurate statistical methods to handle the growing amount of genetic
information made available from genotype arrays and next—generation sequencing technologies.
Results: We introduce a novel statistical method for geopositioning individuals of unknown origin
from genotypes. Our method is based on a geostatistical model trained with a dataset of georefer—
enced genotypes. Statistical inference under this model can be implemented within the theoretical
framework of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation, which represents one of the major recent
breakthroughs in statistics, as it does not require Monte Carlo simulations. We compare the per—
formance of our method and an alternative method for geospatial inference, SPA in a simulation
framework. We highlight the accuracy and limits of continuous spatial assignment methods at
various scales by analyzing genotype datasets from a diversity of species, including Florida Scrub—
jay birds Aphelocoma coerulescens, Arabidopsis thaliana and humans, representing 41—197,146
SNPs. Our method appears to be best suited for the analysis of medium—sized datasets (a few tens
of thousands of loci), such as reduced—representation sequencing data that become increasingly
available in ecology.

Inferring the geographic origin of living organisms from their genetic
information is of great interest for many applications in biology. It can
provide information about gene ﬂow; migration patterns and connect-
ivity in natural populations (Kremer et (11., 2012; Schwartz et (11., 2007;
Waples and Gaggiotti, 2006) but can also help inform wildlife man-
agers about illegal animal translocations and poaching hotspots

gical outbreaks (Sloan et (11., 2009) or the geographic origin of plants

2003). In forensics, DNA—informed geospatial localization can help
profiling criminals and identifying the origin of unidentified bodies
(Primorac and Schanfield, 2014). Here, we introduce Spatial Bayesian
Inference (SPASIBA), a novel method for geospatial assignment. The
premise of the SPASIBA method is that in most natural contexts, spa—
tial patterns of allele frequencies are complex and are likely to be well
captured by a geostatistical model such as the one implemented in the
SCAT program (Wasser et al., 2004), but here, we leverage the power
of a recent breakthrough statistical theory developed by (Rue et al.
2009) and (Lindgren et al. 2011). This allows us to make MCMC—free
inference in only a fraction of the time required by SCAT.

2 Methods

We consider datasets consisting of a set of allelic counts at bi—allelic
loci for a set of reference populations of known geographic loca—
tions. Individuals of unknown geographic origin are genotyped for
the complete set of orthologous loci. Our method is tailored to geo—
graphically assign the latter individuals given the set of georefer—
enced genetic data (hereafter referred to as training data). We
denote by ['51 the frequency of a reference allele at locus l at
geographic location 5. We assume that the number of reference
alleles is binomial B(nsl, ['51) with statistical independence across loci.
This amounts to assuming that individuals located around location 5
form a population at Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium with linkage
equilibrium across markers. Our model has therefore the same likeli—
hood function as the one described by (Pritchard et al. 2000). We as—
sume that spatial variation of allele frequencies can be described by
a non—parametric surface in two dimensions. Following (Wasser
et al. 2004), we model the spatial variation of (7'51): by a set of spa—
tially auto—correlated random variables with Gaussian distribution
(a random field) denoted by 31,). We assume that ['51 and ysl relate
through a logistic function. We model the spatial auto—covariance of
allele frequencies by imposing a parametric form to Cov [3151, y; I]. We
should stress that our method is designed to perform continuous as—
signment. Therefore, we cannot only rely on a covariance matrix,
but need instead a covariance function, which models covariance
variation in the continuous space. This model can be defined either
in a flat geographic domain, using straightline distances (2D) or on
the sphere using great circle distances (a sub—model referred to
be low as 3D model, better appropriate to analyze worldwide
datasets). Under our model, the covariance between allele frequen—
cies at geographic locations 5 and 5’ decays with the geographic dis—
tance (s — 5') and therefore captures the form of population structure
known as isolation—by—distance (Guillot et al., 2009). A key feature
of our model is that it can be handled within the Integrated Nested
Laplace Approximation (INLA) framework. The location of samples
from unknown geographic origin is estimated following three steps.
In the first step, we estimate the parameters of the covariance model
from the set of georeferenced genetic data, which summarize infor—
mation on the magnitude and the spatial scale of variation of allele
frequencies. In the second step, we compute estimated geographic
maps of allele frequencies for each locus using the parameters previ—
ously estimated. In the third step, we assign samples of unknown
origin by maximizing the likelihood that a sample comes from a spe—
cific location over the study area (discretized over a fine grid). Our
method is described in full detail in the Supporting material.

3 Results

In Supporting material, we assess the performance of our method
and SPA (Yang et al., 2012), the most—commonly used method in

geospatial assignment. We evaluated the accuracy of both methods
using real and simulated datasets, spanning a range of possible
applications in biology. The three application cases considered
included organisms characterized by very diverse vagility and disper—
sal behaviors, spatial scales ranging from the regional to the contin—
ental scale and genotyping information ranging from 41 to 197 146
SNPs. Simulations were performed under a series of statistical mod—
els, selected to uncover different underlying biological processes. In
most situations, our method was found to outperform SPA, showing
assignment errors corresponding to only a fraction of those meas—
ured in SPA. The difference between both methods was most pro—
nounced when a limited number of loci were considered.

4 Conclusion

The statistical model underlying our method is largely reminiscent
of the SCAT program (Wasser et al., 2004, 2007). However, build—
ing on INLA instead of MCMC allowed us to significantly reduce
computing times by typically several orders of magnitudes. In add—
ition, our approach is free of MCMC convergence issues that can
considerably increase the computation burden. In the Florida Scrub—
jay dataset (1311 individuals, 41 SNPs), SPASIBA achieved a full
analysis in ~10 min using a single 3—GHz CPU. SCAT required
about a week of computation, while SPA provided results within a
few seconds. These computing times scale linearly with the number
of loci. With such running times and the accuracy levels demon—
strated above, SPASIBA appears appropriate for the routine analysis
of SNP datasets consisting of a few tens of thousands of loci. In par—
ticular, it appears to be an ideal method for the analysis reduced—
representation sequencing data that become increasingly available in
ecology, including for non—model organisms (Davey et al., 2011).

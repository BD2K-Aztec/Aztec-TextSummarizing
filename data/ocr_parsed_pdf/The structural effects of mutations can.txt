Abstract

Motivation: High—throughput sequencing platforms are increasingly used to screen patients with
genetic disease for pathogenic mutations, but prediction of the effects of mutations remains chal—
lenging. Previously we developed SAAPdap (Single Amino Acid Polymorphism Data Analysis
Pipeline) and SAAPpred (Single Amino Acid Polymorphism Predictor) that use a combination of
rule—based structural measures to predict whether a missense genetic variant is pathogenic. Here
we investigate whether the same methodology can be used to develop a differential phenotype
predictor, which, once a mutation has been predicted as pathogenic, is able to distinguish between
phenotypes—in this case the two major clinical phenotypes (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HCM
and dilated cardiomyopathy, DCM) associated with mutations in the beta—myosin heavy chain
(MYH7) gene product (Myosin—7).

Results: A random forest predictor trained on rule—based structural analyses together with struc—
tural clustering data gave a Matthews’ correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.53 (accuracy, 75%). A post
hoc removal of machine learning models that performed particularly badly, increased the perform—
ance (MCC = 0.61, Acc = 79%). This proof of concept suggests that methods used for pathogenicity
prediction can be extended for use in differential phenotype prediction.

1 Introduction

Mutations in proteins generally result in loss of function, but in
some cases can lead to a gain of function. Generally this is not gain
of a novel function, but an increased activity, often through loss of
some type of control mechanism. In general, predictors of

pathogenicity do not try to distinguish between loss—of—function and
gain—of—function mutations, but simply predict Whether or not there
will be some effect on function leading to a pathogenic state.

In some cases however, the situation is more complex, with
mutations in a single protein leading to a number of distinct pheno—
types. For example, inherited heart muscle diseases, or

cardiomyopathies, which are a major cause of sudden cardiac death
in the young and an important cause of heart failure at all ages
(Hughes and McKenna, 2005) are, as a group, very heterogeneous
in genotype and phenotype. Radically different phenotypes can re—
sult from mutations in the same gene (Arad et (11., 2002).

The widespread application of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
(SNP) chips and high—throughput sequencing has generated an urgent
need for informatics tools that can help predict the effects of the many
sequence variants that these platforms identify. More than 20 groups
have devised methods to predict whether a given mutation will have a
deleterious effect (Al—Numair and Martin, 2013; Bao et (11., 2005;
Bromberg and Rost, 2007; Bromberg et (11., 2008; Calabrese et (11.,
2009; Dantzer et (11., 2005; Gonzalez—Perez and Lopez—Bigas, 2011;
Karchin et (11., 2005; Kircher et (11., 2014; Li et (11., 2009; Reumers
et (11., 2005; Reva et (11., 2011; Schwarz et (11., 2010; Shihab et (11.,
2013; Stitziel et (11., 2004; Uzun et (11., 2007; Worth et (11., 2011; Yates
et (11., 2014; Yip et (11., 2004; Yue et (11., 2006), the best known meth—
ods being SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2003), an evolutionary method
which calculates a sophisticated residue conservation score from mul—
tiple alignment, and PolyPhen—2 (Adzhubei et (11., 2010, 2013), which
uses machine learning on a set of eight sequence— and three structure—
based features. A more complete list of methods is provided on our
web site at http://www.bioinf.org.uk/saap/methodsl. However, these
tools are generally not validated for individual diseases where most
available datasets are too small to train machine—learning methods
and tend to be heavily unbalanced. An additional problem is that it is
often very difficult to obtain reliable validated data on neutral muta—
tions. One of the few cases where a predictor has been produced for
an individual class of proteins is the work on voltage—gated potassium
channels by Stead et al. (201 1).

Attempting to distinguish between mutations in a single protein
that result in different pathogenic phenotypes is a difficult problem
that, unlike pathogenicity prediction, has not been widely addressed.
There have been a small number of attempts to distinguish loss—of—
function and gain—of—function mutations at a molecular level, but (as
stated above) typically gain—of—function mutations result from loss of
regulation making the protein constitutiver active. For example, mu—
tations that cause the VAB—1 tyrosine kinase to become constitutiver
active cause severe axon defects (Mohamed and Chin—Sang, 2006).
Some of the challenges in the ‘Comparative Assessment of Genome
Interpretation’ (CAGI) experiment have required the prediction of the
level of enzyme activity (e.g. genomeinterpretation.org/content/4—
NAGLU) and some have been related to familial combined hyperlipid—
emia or channelopathies (genomeinterpretation.org/content/FCH,
genomeinterpretation.org/content/scn5a), but, to our knowledge,
there have been no clear cases where predictions have focused on mu—
tations in the same protein resulting in different phenotypes other
than through loss of function versus loss of regulation.

Initially our own focus was on trying to understand the effects
that mutations have on protein structure and then to use this infor—
mation to compare the effects of non—pathogenic mutations and
pathogenic deviations (Hurst et (11., 2009). Our approach has been
to map mutations onto protein structure and to perform a rule—
based analysis of the likely structural effects of these mutations in
order to ‘explain’ the known functional effect (if any) of the muta—
tion. Since we map mutations to structure, we only consider muta—
tions in proteins for which a structure has been solved. With the
recent growth in the amount of mutation data, we have moved from
updating a database of analysis of mutations, to providing a server
(SAAPdap—Single Amino Acid Polymorphism Data Analysis
Pipeline) for analysis of the effects of mutations (http://www.bioinf.
org.uk/saap/dap/) (Al—Numair and Martin, 2013). The approach has

been used to study structural differences between disease—causing
mutations and neutral polymorphisms (Al—Numair and Martin,
2013; Hurst et (11., 2009), and to analyze mutations in glucose—6—
phosphate dehydrogenase (Kwok et (11., 2002) and in the tumour
suppressor P53 (Martin et (11., 2002).

While SAAPdap uses a combination of rule—based structural meas—
ures to assess whether a mutation is likely to alter the local structural
environment, we have also developed SAAPpred (Single Amino Acid
Polymorphism Predictor) which exploits the results of the structural
analysis and uses a Random Forest machine—learning method to pre—
dict whether mutations are pathogenic (Al—Numair and Martin,
2013). SAAPpred is restricted to analyzing mutations in proteins for
which a native structure is available, but appears to outperform meth—
ods such as SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2003), PolyPhen—2 (Adzhubei
et (11., 2010, 2013) and FATHMM (Shihab et (11., 2013).

In this paper, we investigate whether having predicted a muta—
tion as being pathogenic, the approach that we developed for
SAAPdap and SAAPpred can be used for differential phenotype pre—
diction, specifically for mutations in the beta—myosin heavy chain
(Myosin—7, UniProtKB/SwissProt accession P12883, http://www.uni
prot.org/uniprot/P12883), encoded by the MYH7 gene (OMIM
"160760). Mutations in MYH 7 lead to a number of phenotypes, the
most common being hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, OMIM
#192600) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, OMIM #613426).
The numbers of mutations available for other phenotypes are very
small and consequently, for this proof—of—concept paper, we have at—
tempted to distinguish just between HCM and DCM.

Myosin—7 is part of the force—generating molecular motor of the
sarcomere and parts of the structure have been solved. It is divided
into three main domains as shown in Supplementary Figure S1: a
globular ‘head’, which includes the ATP—binding site and the actin—
binding site; the ‘neck’ which is composed of an ot—helical domain to
which the myosin light chains bind and which is further subdivided
into a converter region and a lever arm involved in the amplification
of mechanical energy; and the ‘tail’ or ‘rod’ region. Together with
MYBPC3 (the gene encoding myosin binding protein C), mutations
in MYH7 are the major cause of HCM as well as being a cause of
DCM and left ventricular non—compaction (LVNC) (Haas et (11.,
2014). In contrast to MYBPC3, where most pathogenic variants
cause mRNA and protein truncation, the large majority of MYH 7
variants are missense (Carrier et (11., 1997; Richard et (11., 2003)
which often makes prediction of pathogenicity problematic (Kumar
et (11., 2013; Walsh et (11., 2010).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Dataset of variants

A dataset of M YH 7 variants was built from (i) disease—causing or likely—
pathogenic variants for which phenotypic data are available in the
Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD) (Stenson et (11., 2002);
(ii) variants found in a curated dataset extracted from the literature and
used for commercial gene testing reports (Health in Code SL); and (iii)
variants detected in a cohort of consecutively evaluated unrelated
HCM/DCM patients at the UCLH Heart Hospital. Genetic analysis
was approved by the UCLH review board (IRB) and informed written
consent was obtained from all subjects (Lopes et (11., 2013). Although
there are no co—segregation data or functional studies that can ‘prove’
the causality of mutations, selected variants from all three datasets were
rare as defined by a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.5% in the
ESP6500 NIH Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) exome
sequencing project database (Andreasen et (11., 2013; Pan et (11., 2012).
Consequently as it is not possible to know whether variants are truly

Differential phenotype prediction of beta—m yosin heavy chain variants 3

 

pathogenic, we treat mutations associated with an HCM or DCM car—
diomyopathy phenotype in the above—mentioned databases, or in the lit—
erature, as actual positives. This dataset is larger and more
comprehensive than the data available from other sources and contains
approximately twice the number of Myosin—7 mutations available in
Swissvar/Humsavar. The complete dataset has been provided as
SupplementaryFilel .xls. Proprietary data from HGMD, where
the mutations are not available in other datasets, have been indicated
solely by their HGMD accession code. The numbers of mutations for
each phenotype are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.

A total of 395 unique mutations (i.e. distinct mutations, different
from one another at the protein level) were identified in the MYH 7
gene. More than two—thirds of them have previously been published in
the literature as being associated with disease and the others are novel
variants. Since we map mutations to protein structure and therefore
require a structure to be solved of the protein of interest, we are not
able to analyze all mutations. Of the 395 mutations, 157 (39.7%) did
not map to structure and therefore could not be analyzed (see
Supplementary Table S2). This situation should improve as further
structures become available. 382 of the 395 unique mutations had a
recorded phenotype and of these 228 mapped to at least one Protein
DataBank (PDB) chain. Supplementary Table S3 lists the PDB struc—
tures that were identified for human Myosin—7. When preparing the
dataset in 2014, five structures were available and three (PDB IDs:
2fxm, 2fxo and 4db1) were used in this work. The two other struc—
tures (IDs: 1ik2 and 3dtp) were eliminated since 1ik2 is a theoretical
model and 3dtp is a human—chicken fusion protein. Preliminary ex—
periments that included this fusion protein, which covers the same re—
gion as 2fxm and 2fxo, degraded the results. Since this dataset was
built, a number of other structures have become available in the
PDB—some very recently—all but one of which map to the myosin
tail (see Supplementary Figure S1), but all are also chimeric fusion
proteins (see Supplementary Table S3). Consequently none of these
structures has been included at this stage.

Most mutations were associated with HCM (n :290), whereas
all other phenotypes were associated with fewer than 50 mutations
each, including DCM with the next highest number of mutations
(n :46). Of the unique HCM and DCM mutations, 190 and 21 re—
spectively mapped to structure (see Supplementary Table S2). Since
mutations related to these phenotypes were the most abundant, for
this proof of concept, further analyses were restricted to HCM and
DCM, grouping the remaining phenotypes as ‘other’.

2.2 SAAPdap structural analysis and SAAPpred

Our previous software, SAAPdap (Al—Numair and Martin, 2013) per—
forms a set of 14 structural analyses (using software written in Perl and
C), plus the calculation of solvent accessibility (Lee and Richards,
1971). SAAPdap provides cutoffs for each of the analyses to suggest
whether these are likely to be damaging (Al—Numair and Martin, 2013;
Hurst et al., 2009). To predict pathogenicity, a total of 47 features are
derived from these analyses (Supplementary Table S1) and are used as
input to SAAPpred, a machine learning method that uses Random
Forests to predict whether a mutation is pathogenic (Al—Numair and
Martin, 2013). In this paper, the same methodology is used but, rather
than using a dataset of pathogenic and phenotypically silent mutations,
a dataset of HCM and DCM mutations in Myosin—7 is used.

2.3 A machine—learning approach for MYH7 differential
phenotype prediction

As described above, for machine learning, all mutations associated
with multiple phenotypes, or causing phenotypes other than HCM

or DCM, were discarded leaving 190 unique HCM and 21 unique
DCM mutations which map to structure (Supplementary Table S2).

Using the results of the SAAPdap structural analysis described
above, of the 47 features used to describe the mutations, 14 were
found to be redundant (i.e. they had the same value for all examples
in the dataset: the 13 UniProtKB/SwissProt features and the disul—
phide (SSGeom) analysis), thus reducing the number of informative
features to 33.

Since multiple structures have been solved for M YH 7, for a given
mutation, the numeric values of the features derived for each version
of the structure can be slightly different. Although a single structure
was used with SAAPpred, because of the limited size of the available
dataset for differential phenotype prediction, it was desirable to ex—
ploit the variability in multiple structures to expand and enrich the
dataset. PDB files 4db1 and 2fxm contain two copies of the protein
while 2fxo contains four copies. For each mutation, the feature vec—
tors, defined from analysis of the structure, were described using the
Weka Attribute—Relation File Format (ARFF). These data were then
used to train Random Forest predictors implemented in WEKA ver—
sion 3.6.7 (Witten et al., 2011).

The Weka Random Forest gives a classification based on a jury
vote from the trees and produces a confidence score which is the
fraction of trees that gave that prediction. Thus the confidence score
is always between 0.5 and 1.0. In the prediction phase, the scores
for the two classes are averaged separately and the higher average
score is selected as the prediction. The confidence scores were then
rescaled to run from —1.0 (DCM) to + 1.0 (HCM).

The parameter space described by the number of features used in
each tree decision point (mm) and the number of trees (T) was
explored to find the best parameters for machine learning.

2.4 Cross—validation

A given mutation has multiple feature vectors describing the muta—
tion in different copies of the structure. From the machine—learning
perspective, each is a separate data point. Thus the use of multiple
structures for each mutation meant that cross—validation could not
be performed within WEKA since it is possible that WEKA could se—
lect the same mutation (in a different structure) to be in both train—
ing and testing sets.

To address the cross—validation problem and to deal with the se—
vere imbalance of the dataset (there being many more HCM muta—
tions than DCM), Perl code was written to limit the size of each
class by selecting examples at random and to divide the 190 HCM
and 21 DCM unique mutations with available PDB structures into
sets of approximately the same size. For example, if the data were
split into 21 sets, each of these 21 sets in turn (each containing one
DCM mutation) was chosen as a test set and the remaining 20 sets
(together containing the remaining 20 DCMs) were used for train—
ing. In each case, the datasets were enlarged with all the available
PDB chain structures and balanced training datasets were generated
by retaining all the DCM mutations and randomly drawing the
same number of mutations from the HCM dataset. The random
draws from the HCM dataset were taken 10 times over to provide a
representative sample of the HCM class and the results from the
trained predictors were averaged.

2.5 Structural clustering of mutations

Anecdotal evidence suggested that HCM— and DCM—associated mu—
tations tend to be distributed differently across the Myosin—7 struc—
ture. This observation was exploited to provide additional features
for the machine learning.

9103 ‘Og isanV no seleﬁuv soc] ‘BtHJOJtIBQ JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'S[BIIJHO[pJOJXO'SOIJBLUJOJIIIth/ﬂdnq 11101} papeolumoq

N. S.AI—Numair et aI.

 

PDB files 2fxm and 2fxo, which represent the C—terminal region,
contain only two DCM mutations compared with 35 HCM, indicat—
ing that DCM mutations are very rare in this domain. For the N—ter—
minal domain (PDB file 4db1), the Cat positions of the mutated
residues were clustered using single linkage hierarchical clustering.
For each of 2. . .10 clusters, a  test was performed to see how
well the clustering separated HCM from DCM mutations. As
described in the Results, three clusters have the best significance for
the clustering.

To use this information in machine learning, the centroid of each
cluster was calculated and the feature vector for each mutation was
expanded by the addition of the three distances from the C—alpha of
the mutated residue to each of the three centroids. Mutations that
were in the C—terminal domain (and mapped to PDB files 2fxm and
2fxo rather than 4db1) were given distances of 100.0, 100.0, 100.0
A from the three clusters. To use this information in the Random
Forests, these three additional features were added to the feature
vectors in the ARFF files.

2.6 Optimizing the machine learning: feature selection
As well as using the full set of 33 non—redundant features from
SAAPdap (the ‘All’ set) with or without the three clustering features,
five reduced feature sets were explored. The first two of these were
chosen to change the way that voids are treated, while the remaining
sets were generated using feature selection to identify the most in—
formative features.

' All is the full set of 33 informative features (47 from SAAPdap,
but with the 14 redundant features, which were identical for
all mutations, removed): BuriedCharge, Binding, CorePhilic,
CisPro, Clash, Glycine, HBond, ImPACT, Interface,
MutantLargestVoid1. . .MutantLargestVoid10,
NativeLargestVoid1. . .NativeLargestVoid10, Proline, RelAccess,
SurfacePhobic, Void. (See Supplementary Table S1 for explan—
ation of the feature names.)

' Top 5 voids uses the top ﬁve largest voids (before and after muta—
tion) instead of the standard top 10: BuriedCharge, Binding,
CorePhilic, CisPro, Clash, Glycine, HBond, ImPACT, Interface,
MutantLargestVoid1. . .NativeLargestVoid1 0
NativeLargestVoid1. . .NativeLargestVoid10 Proline, RelAccess,
SurfacePhobic, Void.

' Delta Voids uses the differences in the sizes of the top 10 voids in
native and mutant structures rather than absolute values:
BuriedCharge, Binding, CorePhilic, CisPro, Clash, Glycine,
HBond, ImPACT, Interface, DeltaLargestVoid11. . .
NativeLargestVoid1 Proline, RelAccess, SurfacePhobic, Void.

' Set1 uses the three features from the ‘All’ set found, individually,
to be most discriminatory together with the relative solvent ac—
cessibility. A  test was performed applying the default ‘damag—
ing’ threshold (Al—Numair and Martin, 2013) to each feature to
determine how well the feature could separate mutations associ—
ated with HCM and DCM. See Supplementary Table S4. The
three most informative features were found to be residue conser—
vation, mutations affecting glycine residues and those affecting
residues involved in speciﬁc binding interactions. Accessibility
was also included since our observations of the clustering of
HCM and DCM residues showed clear differences in accessibil—
ity within the clusters. Thus the feature set used was: Binding,
RelAccess, ImPACT and Glycine.

' Set2 was generated using the ‘BestFirst’ feature selection
method within Weka. The ‘BestFirst’ algorthm searches the space
of attribute subsets by greedy hillclimbing augmented with

backtracking. The feature set based on feature selecting from the
‘hemc set was: Binding, RelAccess, SurfacePhobic, CorePhilic,
TotalVoidVolume, MutantLargestVoid, NativeLargestVoid, Clash,
Proline, CisPro.

' Set3 was also generated using the ‘BestFirst’ feature selection but
on the ‘Delta Voids’ set. Selected features were: Binding,
Interface, RelAccess, ImPACT, Hbond, BuriedCharge,
DeltaVoidTotal, DeltaVoidLargest1,. . .NativeLargestVoid
Clash, Glycine.

Initially, the number of machine—learning models was tested
using the full feature set (‘All’), plus those feature sets that reduced
the amount of void data (‘Top 5 voids’ and ‘Delta voids’), with and
without the clustering features. Having established that 11 models
was the most effective, the reduced feature sets were explored using
a smaller value of mm, owing to the much reduced number of
features.

2.7 Control experiments

Three control experiments were performed to ensure that the use of
structural information in addition to sequence information or clus—
tering was worthwhile.

First, to demonstrate improved prediction over a simple
sequence—based predictor, a set of control experiments was run using
only features derived from sequence data. These experiments are
described in detail in SupplementaryFile3 .pdf. Brieﬂy, two
different amino acid encodings were used, with and without conser—
vation score, residue number (since position in the sequence can be
regarded as a proxy for domain information, given that it is known
that some phenotypes correlate with certain domains) and context—
ual information (one, three or five amino acids either side of the
mutated residue). In total, 10 feature sets were considered and for
each, four experiments were performed using different machine
learning approaches.

Second, to ensure that the performance of the predictor does not
come only from the structural clustering, we also tested the perform—
ance using the structural clusters alone. Using the 2—10 structural
clusters described above, each cluster was assigned as a DCM or
HCM cluster based on that phenotype having a higher observed/ex—
pected ratio in that cluster. An additional cluster was created to rep—
resent the mutations that map to the C—terminal domain (PDB code
2fxm or 2fxo) which has a very small number of DCM mutations.
Each mutation was then predicted as DCM or HCM based on its
cluster membership. For a real prediction problem, cluster member—
ship would need to be assigned based on the distance to the closest
cluster centre (average linkage) or closest cluster member (single
linkage). Performance was then calculated for each level of
clustering.

Finally, as a control on the overall prediction, the testing was re—
peated using two of the test sets, but the labels were randomly
shufﬂed five times over.

3.1 MYH7 mutation data analysis and prediction of
pathogenicity

The distribution of the variants amongst the structural and
functionally—annotated domains of the beta—myosin heavy chain pro—
tein was analyzed. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the regions
for which structures are known and the distribution of observed mu—
tations together with the domains of the Myosin—7 sequence as
annotated by UniProtKB/SwissProt (UniProt Consortium, 2014)

ID:P12883) and InterPro (Hunter et al., 2012) (http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/interpro/protein/P12883). All of the 238 unique variants that
mapped to structure were located in the myosin globular ‘head’ do—
main or the ‘neck’ region with no mutations seen in the ‘tail’ or ‘IQ
motif’ regions. 99.1% of mutations were in annotated domains or
regions, while just two mutations (0.9%, at positions 82 and 838)
were in un—annotated parts of the sequence. The numbers of HCM
and DCM mutations seen in each of the annotated domains are
shown in Supplementary Table S5.

The individual structural effects for the 228 unique mutations
which mapped to structure and for which a phenotype was also re—
corded (see Supplementary Table S2) were analyzed using SAAPdap.
175 variants (76.8%) had one or more individual structural effects
classified as likely to be damaging by the individual SAAPdap ana—
lyses while for 55 variants, no significant individual structural effect
was detected (see Table 1). The features affected most frequently
were: mutation of a highly conserved residue (ImPACT) occurring in
138 variants; mutation of an interface amino acid occurring in 48
variants; and disruption of hydrogen—bonds occurring in 42 variants.
Other significant mutation effects occurred less frequently, with no
observed mutations causing voids.

Before attempting to perform differential phenotype predic—
tion, it would be necessary to predict that a mutation is patho—
genic. The output from SAAPdap for the 228 unique mutations
that mapped to structure was fed into SAAPpred (Al—Numair and
Martin, 2013) and 93.0% of mutations were predicted as patho—
genic (i.e. Sn : 0.930). This compares with 69.51% predicted to be
pathogenic using SIFT and 90% predicted to be pathogenic using
PolyPhen—2. Other metrics such as specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc),
the F1—score and the Matthews’ Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
could not be calculated since no set of validated non—pathogenic
single amino acid mutations is available—even in the ESP 5K and
1000 Genomes data there are very few missense variants in MYH7
with a frequency >5% that could comfortably be classified as
benign.

3.2 Initial machine learning results for differential
phenotype prediction

As described in the Materials and Methods, machine learning was
performed using random forests implemented in Weka with the 33
non—redundant features from SAAPdap structural analysis
(Supplementary Table S1). Since each mutation mapped to multiple
structures, cross—validation was performed outside Weka to ensure
that the same mutation was not included in the training and testing
sets (but mapped to different structures). The parameter space
described by the number of features used in each tree decision point
(mtry) and the number of trees (T) was explored and, as shown in
Table 2, the best results were obtained using 1000 trees with 20 fea—
tures (accuracy of 70% and MCC : 0.41).

3.3 Structural clustering of mutations

As described in the Materials and Methods, the Cat positions of the
mutated residues were clustered using single linkage hierarchical
clustering and a  test was performed for each of 2. . .10 clusters, to
see how well the clustering separated HCM from DCM mutations.
Results are shown in Table 3. Apart from two clusters, these are all
clearly significant at the P < 0.05 level. However, as the number of
clusters gets larger, one needs to take care with the significance lev—
els, because no more than 20% of expected values should be <5 and
none <1 (significance will be over—estimated if either of these is
true). For 2 4 clusters, the first of these fails and for Z 6 clusters the
second also fails. However, between three and six clusters the sig—
nificance is so good, that (while it will be over—estimated for 4—6
clusters) it is clearly still better than P < 0.05 with 3 clusters passing
both of the validity criteria and giving a highly significant result
even if a Bonferroni correction is made for multiple testing.
Consequently we clearly have clusters of residues in the N—terminal
region that are over/under populated with DCM and HCM muta—
tions compared with what is expected.

Figure 1 illustrates the three clusters in the N—terminal domain
contained in PDB file 4db1. Cluster members are listed in
SupplementaryFileZ . txt and shown on the sequence in
Supplementary Figure S2. In particular, DCM is highly over—
represented in the third (blue/cyan) cluster. DCM mutations in clus—
ters 1 and 2 (orange and yellow) are hardly visible and therefore
mostly buried. On the other hand, the DCM mutations in cluster 3
(cyan) are largely on the surface.

The highest signiﬁcance result is shown in bold. For the P—value to be reli—
able, there must be no more than 20% of expected counts less than ﬁve.
Consequently the P—values for 2 4 clusters will be over—estimated.

3: blue, while DCM mutations are shown in 1: orange, 2: yellow and 3: cyan.
DCM mutations are over-represented in cluster 3 (cyan); when they appear in
clusters 1 and 2, (orange and yellow) they are mostly buried

As a control, to ensure that the significance of the clustering was
not a random effect, we also permuted the labels randomly for the
three clusters 1000 times over and calculated the average random P—
value (P = 0.5133, 0,,_1 = 02859) from a )8 test. This is clearly not
significant and compares with the true labels which gave a
P < 0.0003755. This p—value is 1.794 standard deviations away
from the mean on the distribution of random P—values which is sig—
nificant at the P < 0.05 level.

3.4 Optimizing the machine learning
Initial training to explore the number of trees and features con—
sidered per decision point was performed as described in the mater—
ials and methods using 10 machine—learning models (equivalent to
cross—validation folds, each with a random selection of the HCM
data) with the prediction results averaged across the 10. After deter—
mining the optimum number of features considered per descision
point and number of trees, the different feature subsets were
explored together with different numbers of machine—learning mod—
els (5, 11 and 21 models). Addition of the ‘clustering’ feature
described above was also explored.

As shown in Table 4, the best performance was obtained using
11 machine—learning models with ‘Set2’ plus the clustering features.
Cross—validation with 11 models used 19 of the 21 DCMs in each
training set with 2 held back for testing. This gave an accuracy of
75% and MCC = 0.531. By removing two machine—learning models
that performed particularly badly and did not predict any DCM mu—
tations (whether correct or incorrect), this increased to an accuracy
of 79% and MCC=0.61. It appears that these particularly bad
machine—learning models have failed to learn the characteristics of
DCM mutations. To apply the method to novel mutations, we
would remove these two bad machine—learning models and use the
remaining nine to make predictions.

3.5 Control experiments

First, a set of 40 control experiments were performed to demon—
strate improved prediction over a simple sequence—based predictor.
Only five of the 40 experiments showed a mean MCC >0.1 with the
best performance being a mean MCC = 0.167 which is clearly con—
siderably worse than our full predictor (MCC = 0.5 3, or
MCC=0.61 with the worst machine—learning models removed)—
See SupplementaryFile3 .pdf.

Second, a control experiment was performed to ensure that the
performance of the predictor does not come only from the structural
clustering, by assigning a prediction of DCM or HCM based purely
on cluster membership. The best performance was achieved with
three clusters (plus the C—terminal domain cluster): MCC=0.33,
ACC= 0.89, SnHCM = 0.95, SnDCM = 0.33. Clearly this perform—
ance is considerably worse than our full predictor as judged by
MCC (full predictor MCC=0.53, or MCC=0.61 with the worst
machine—learning models removed).

This is also a good example to illustrate the well—known problem
in machine learning that accuracy is a poor indicator of performance
with unbalanced datasets (the cluster—only prediction gives
ACC = 0.89 while the full predictor gives ACC = 0.75, or
ACC = 0.79 with the worst models machine—learning removed).
However, simply predicting everything as HCM would give
ACC=0.90 and, by definition, SnHCM = 1.00 and SnDCM = 0.00,
while the MCC would be a much better indicator of overall per—
formance giving a value of MCC = 0.12 (adding 1 to TP,FP,TN,FN
since TN = FN = 0 results in a divide—by—zero error and treating
HCM as positive and DCM as negative.)

Finally, the overall prediction control experiment, shufﬂing the
labels on two of the test sets randomly, as expected, gave essentially
random prediction performance with an MCC = —0.123 for the first
test set and MCC = —0.115 for the second test set.

It is logical to assume that the functional consequences of mutations
in the same gene depend on the specific domain or region where the

variant is localized (Woo et al., 2003), but the hypothesis that the
structural impact of a missense variant inﬂuences differential patho—
genic phenotype or outcome has not previously been tested.

In practice, a novel mutation would be tested for predicted
pathogenicity before an HCM/DCM prediction was performed. We
confirmed that the SAAPpred approach performs well in identifying
pathogenic mutations in MYH7 and went on to test a machine—
learning method that discriminated between pathogenic variants
associated with an HCM or DCM phenotype (accuracy of 75 % and
MCC : 0.531). This was achieved by averaging 11 machine—
learning models using feature Set2 (Binding, RelAccess,
SurfacePhobic, CorePhilic, Voids, MutantLargestVoid1 ,
NativeLargestVoid1, Clash, Proline, CisPro and Clustering) and
using 1000 trees with 5 features. These differential phenotype pre—
diction results are surprisingly good considering the limited size of
the dataset used in training. Indeed the results are as good as the
overall performance of some methods used for general pathogenicity
prediction—for example, our assessment (Al—Numair and Martin,
2013) of MutationAssessor showed an overall accuracy of 69.8%
and MCC: 0.453, while SIFT showed an overall accuracy of
76.3% and MCC : 0.528. Clearly these results are comparable with
what we are able to achieve for HCM/DCM differential phenotype
prediction which is a more difficult problem owing to the small
unbalanced dataset. By removing two machine—learning models that
performed particularly badly, the performance was increased to an
accuracy of 79% and MCC : 0.61.

Because the SAAPdap structural analysis relies on having a crys—
tal structure of the protein in question, our predictions are limited to
mutations in regions of the protein for which a structure has been
solved. Consequently, we are only able to look at 190 of 290 unique
mutations leading to HCM and 21 of 46 mutations leading to
DCM. As structures become available for more of the protein, then
this situation will improve and some new structures have become
available since our dataset was built. However, for mutations that
are present in disordered regions of structure, different methods of
prediction will be required. It is also possible that the performance
of the method may be further improved by taking into account miss—
ing parts of the structure. However, since all the structural

parameters included in the prediction are the results of local inter—
actions, this is unlikely to have a significant effect.

Our analysis of the structural distribution of HCM— and DCM—
associated mutations showed that there was a highly statistically sig—
nificant difference in the locations of these mutations. Referring to
Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2, DCM is highly over—
represented in the blue/cyan cluster and largely on the surface, while
DCM mutations present in the remaining clusters are mostly buried.
The functional consequences of this distribution warrant further
in vitro studies.

4.1 Conclusions and future directions

Missense single nucleotide variants in MYH7 lead to a dominant
negative effect in which the mutated protein is not degraded but ra—
ther integrates into the sarcomere, leading to the disease phenotype.
The various effects of individual variants on fibre contractile vel—
ocity, force and calcium sensitivity have been proposed as an explan—
ation for the existence of dramatically different phenotypes arising
from genetic variation in the same molecule. A paradigm has been
proposed whereby mutations that increase motor activity and power
output lead to HCM, while those that diminish motor function and
decrease power output lead to DCM (Spudich, 2014).

Our SAAPpred predictor currently relies on having a structure
available for the protein in question, but planned enhancements in—
clude the use of modelled structures where no experimental struc—
ture is available and exploitation of structural information from
homologues. In the same way, we plan to expand the data points for
our differential phenotype predictor by including information from
homologous proteins. In future work, we will also explore the newly
available chimeric structures to see if they can be used for prediction
of additional mutations.

As more mutation data become available, we also intend to inte—
grate a validated pathogenicity predictor with a three—class differen—
tial phenotype predictor (HCM versus DCM versus other) although
there is no a priori reason to believe that all ‘other’ mutations will
have shared properties, or indeed that they will have properties that
are very different from HCM or DCM. As a preliminary experiment,

we selected 10 ‘other’ mutations (some collected after the main data—
set was built) at random and found that nine of them were predicted
as pathogenic using SAAPpred. If the properties of these mutations
are significantly different from HCM and DCM we might expect the
confidence scores provided by the differential phenotype predictor
to be very low. We analyzed all 10 mutations and found that eight
were predicted as HCM and two as DCM. For two of the HCM pre—
dictions (including the one predicted as SNP by SAAPpred), the con—
fidence score was indeed very low (<0.05), but for the others, the
confidence was >0.3, typical of other predictions (see
Supplementary Table S6). Nonetheless, we intend to explore this
further.

This work confirms the hypothesis that structural data can be
used with machine learning to create a differential phenotype pre—
dictor, in this case able to distinguish between HCM and DCM mu—
tations in MYH 7. The performance exceeds that of the well—known
SIFT program in the problem of predicting pathogenic versus neu—
tral mutations. Differential phenotype prediction has all the chal—
lenges of pathogenicity prediction with the added complications of
having a small unbalanced dataset. This work provides the basis for
differential phenotype prediction and with further work could be
used to guide clinical genetic testing strategies and further clinical
investigations.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Circadian rhythms are prevalent in most organisms.
Identification of circadian-regulated genes is a crucial step in
discovering underlying pathways and processes that are clock-
controlled. Such genes are largely detected by searching periodic
patterns in microarray data. However, temporal gene expression
profiles usually have a short time-series with low sampling frequency
and high levels of noise. This makes circadian rhythmic analysis of
temporal microarray data very challenging.

Results: We propose an algorithm named ARSER, which combines
time domain and frequency domain analysis for extracting and
characterizing rhythmic expression profiles from temporal microarray
data. ARSER employs autoregressive spectral estimation to predict
an expression profile’s periodicity from the frequency spectrum and
then models the rhythmic patterns by using a harmonic regression
model to fit the time-series. ARSER describes the rhythmic patterns
by four parameters: period, phase, amplitude and mean level, and
measures the multiple testing significance by false discovery rate
q-value. When tested on well defined periodic and non-periodic short
time-series data, ARSER was superior to two existing and widely-
used methods, COSOPT and Fisher’s G-test, during identification of
sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal periodic patterns in short, noisy and
non-stationary time-series. Finally, analysis ofArabidopsis microarray
data using ARSER led to identification of a novel set of previously
undetected non-sinusoidal periodic transcripts, which may lead to
new insights into molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Circadian rhythm is one of the most well-studied periodic processes
in living organisms. DNA microarray technologies have often
been applied in circadian rhythm studies (Dufﬁeld, 2003). Thus,
we can monitor the mRNA expression of the whole-genome
level, which is an effective way to simultaneously identify many
hundreds or thousands of periodic transcripts. The matter to be
addressed is which genes are rhythmically expressed based on their
gene expression proﬁles. This can be classiﬁed as a periodicity
identiﬁcation problem. However, there are computational challenges
when dealing with this issue: sparse determination of sampling rate,
and short periods of data collection for microarray experiments
(Bar-Joseph, 2004). Circadian microarray experiments are usually
designed to collect data every 4h over a course of 48 h, generating
expression proﬁles with 12 or 13 time-points (Yamada and Ueda,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2007). There are two main factors that limit the number of data points
that can be feasibly obtained: budget constraints and dampening
of the circadian rhythm (Ceriani et (11., 2002). Such short time-
series data render many methods of classical time-series analysis
inappropriate, since they generally require much larger samples to
generate statistically signiﬁcant results.

A variety of algorithms have been developed and applied to
microarray time-series analysis; Chudova et (11. (2009) indicated that
the existing technologies fall into two major categories: time-domain
and frequency-domain analyses. Typical time-domain methods rely
on sinusoid-based pattern matching technology, while frequency-
domain methods are based on spectral analysis methods. Of the
time-domain methods, COSOPT (Straume, 2004) is a well-known
algorithm frequently used to analyze circadian microarray data in
Arabidopsis (Edwards et (11., 2006), Drosophila (Ceriani et (11.,
2002) and mammalian systems (Panda et (11., 2002). COSOPT
measures the goodness-of—ﬁt between experimental data and a
series of cosine curves of varying phases and period lengths.
The advantages of pattern-matching methods are simplicity and
computational efﬁciency, while they are not effective at ﬁnding
periodic signals that are not perfectly sinusoidal (Chudova et (11.,
2009).

Of the frequency-domain methods, Fisher’s G-test was proposed
to detect periodic gene expression proﬁles by Wichert et (11.
(2004) and has been used to analyze circadian microarray data
of Arabidopsis (Blasing et (11., 2005) and mammalian systems
(Hughes et (11., 2009; Ptitsyn et (11., 2006). Fisher’s G-test searches
periodicity by computing the periodogram of experimental data and
tests the signiﬁcance of the dominant frequency using Fisher’s G-
statistic; however, it is limited by low frequency resolution for
short time-series generated by circadian microarray experiments,
which means it is often not adequate to resolve the periodicity
of interest (Langmead et (11., 2003). Time-domain and frequency-
domain methods are two different ways to analyze the time-
series, each with advantages and disadvantages. Frequency-domain
methods are noise-tolerant and model-independent but their results
are difﬁcult for biologists to understand. Time-domain methods can
give comprehensive and easily-understood descriptions for rhythms
but are noise-sensitive and model-dependent (e.g. sinusoid).

Considering the above limitations, we propose an algorithm
named ARSER that combines time-domain and frequency-domain
analyses to identify periodic transcripts in large-scale time-course
gene expression proﬁles. ARSER employs autoregressive (AR)
spectral analysis (Takalo et (11., 2005) to estimate the period length
of a circadian rhythm from the frequency spectrum. It is well-suited
to analyze short time-series since it can generate smooth and high-
resolution spectra from gene expression proﬁles. It is related (but
not identical) to a method called maximum entropy spectral analysis,

which has been applied to the analysis of micorarray data (Langmead
et (11., 2002).

After the frequency-domain analysis, ARSER takes harmonic
regression (Warner, 1998) to model the circadian rhythms extracted
from gene expression proﬁles. Harmonic regression models fully
describe the rhythms using four parameters: period (duration of one
complete cycle), the mean level (the mid-value of the time-series),
the amplitude (half the distance from the peak to the trough of the
ﬁtted cosine, indicating the predictable rise and fall around the mean
level) and the phase (the location in time of the peak of the curve).

The joint strategy overcomes the shortcomings of separate time-
domain or frequency-domain analyses. ARSER uses AR spectral
analysis to ﬁnd the circadian rhythms and a harmonic regression
model to characterize and statistically validate them. When tested
on multiple synthetic datasets, ARSER is robust to noise, quickly
and exactly estimates periodicity and gives comprehensive and
statistically signiﬁcant results in analysis of short time-series.

This article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the
mathematical and implemental details of the ARSER algorithm.
Section 3 compares the performance of ARSER with COSOPT and
Fisher’s G-test by testing on different simulation datasets. Numerical
experiments are designed by varying noise intensity and period
length, including random background models and identifying non-
sinusoidal periodic patterns. Finally, ARSER was used to analyze
Arabidopsis microarray data and obtained a novel set of rhythmic
transcripts, many of which showed non-sinusoidal periodic patterns.
Section 4 summarizes the methodology.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

Our methodology to detect circadian rhythms in gene expression proﬁles
consists of three procedures: data pre-processing, period detection and
harmonic regression modeling (Fig. 1A). First, ARSER performs a data
preprocessing strategy called detremz'ing that removes any linear trend from
the time-series so that we can obtain a stationary process to search for cycles.
Detrending is carried out by ordinary least squares (OLS). Second, ARSER
determines the periods of the time-series within the range of circadian period
length (20728 h) (Piccione and Caola, 2002). The method to estimate periods
is carried out by AR spectral analysis, which calculates the power spectral

density of the time-series in the frequency domain. If there are cycles of
circadian period length in the time-series, the AR spectral density curve will
show peaks at each associated frequency (Fig. 1B). With the periods obtained
from AR spectral analysis, ARSER employs harmonic regression to model
the cyclic components in the time-series. Harmonic analysis provides the
estimates of three parameters (amplitude, phase and mean) that describe the
rhythmic patterns. Finally, when analyzing microarray data, false discovery
rate q-values are calculated for multiple comparisons.

2.2 Period detection

As circadian rhythm has approximately (but never exactly) 24 h periodicity
(Harmer, 2009), the ﬁrst matter to be addressed is to measure the length of
actual period for each gene expression proﬁle.

ARSER estimates the period by AR spectral estimation, which is a high-
resolution spectral analysis technique comparing with the classical fast
Fourier transform periodogram. Given an equally sampled time-series {x,}
with the sampling interval A, AR spectral estimation ﬁrst applies an AR
model of order p, abbreviated AR(p), to ﬁt the time-series using the following
equation:

p
X; = Zane—i +8; (1)
i2]

where 8, is white noise and 01, are model parameters (or AR coefﬁcients)
with at], 750 for an order [7 process. Guler et a1. (2001) and Spyers-Ashby
et a1. (1998) reported that AR coefﬁcients are generally estimated by three
methods: the Yule7Walker method, maximum likelihood estimation and the
Burg algorithm. ARSER implements the AR model-ﬁtting by setting order
p: 24/ A and computing the AR coefﬁcients using all three methods.

After AR modeling, AR spectral analysis estimates the spectrum, with
model parameters instead of original data, using the following equation:

02
8
17x00): . 05w<n (2)
|1+ 11::lake—lmkl2
where 082 is the variance of white noise; 01k are parameters deﬁned in

Equation (1). If periodic signals are present in the time-series, then the
spectrum derived from Equation (2) will show peaks at dominant frequencies.
However, at high frequencies the noise signals may also show peaks known
as pseudo-periods.

ARSER obtains the period by using the following step-by-step
procedure:

(1) Remove the linear trend in time-series {xt}, denoting the detrended
time-series as {it}.

(2) Smooth {it} by a fourth-order Savitzkyﬁolay algorithm (Savitzky

series is denoted as {56,}.

regression analysis for {it} by Equation (3).

(6) The optimum periods in {x,} are determined by Akaike’s information
criterion (Akaike, 1974) among the regression models generated in
step 5.

2.3 Rhythm modeling and gene selection

The next matter to be addressed is how to model the rhythmic patterns in
the time-series of gene expression. ARSER employs the harmonic regression
model to represent the cycle trends, which involves ﬁtting sinusoidal models
to a time-series using the following equation:

71
x, =M+Zﬁicosanﬁz+¢i>+at (3)
[’21
where x, is the observed value at time t; p. is the mean level of the time-
series; [3,» is the amplitude of the waveform; d), is the phase, or location of
peaks relative to time zero; 8, are residuals that are unrelated to the ﬁtted
cycles; and t are the sampling time-points.

The f, term in Equation (3) are the dominant frequencies in the circadian
range derived by Equation (2). The periods (If) of the time-series equal
(1 /ﬁ)- A, where A is the sampling interval. Since periods are predetermined
by AR spectral analysis, Equation (3) can be reduced to an even simpler
multiple linear regression model:

71
x, =11+Zipicosrznﬁz>+qisinanﬁnm. (4)

['21
where 17,213,» 005%, (1,»: —ﬁisin¢i. The unknown parameters [7,», q, and p.
can be estimated by OLS method. Then the amplitude 13,» and phase d), are

obtained by )3,» 2.11712 +qi2 and tan¢i = —q,»/p,».

By applying a harmonic regression model, rhythmicity in a time-series
is fully described by four parameters: period, phase, amplitude and mean
level. Tests of statistical signiﬁcance are also essential to distinguish between
real rhythms and random oscillations. In a harmonic regression model, an
F -test is employed to assess the signiﬁcance of pi and q, coefﬁcients, and so
statistically validates the rhythmicity.

When analyzing microarray expression data, tens of thousands of genes
will be estimated simultaneously, so the problem of multiple testing must
be considered. We employed the method of Storey and Tibshirani (2003).
Brieﬂy, by examining the distribution of P-values from the given dataset,
an estimate of the proportion that are truly non-rhythmic can be derived.
The P-value for each transcript can be converted to a more stringent q-value
which represents the false discovery rate. In our study, we consider genes
with q < 0.05 to be rhythmically expressed.

2.4 Generating simulation data

We provide a comprehensive testing strategy to test and compare the
performance of ARSER with COSOPT and Fisher’s G-test. Our simulation
datasets consist of periodic and non-periodic time-series data. The periodic
time-series was generated by two models based on the methods proposed by
Robeva et a1. (2008). One is classiﬁed as a stationary model, deﬁned by

21':
x,=SNR-2cos<Tt—¢) +8, (5)

where SNR is signal-to-noise ratio; r is period; ¢ is phase; and 8, is (11:
0,0: 1) normally distributed noise terms. Another model classiﬁed as a
non-stationary is deﬁned by

x, = 500-2—0‘0” +SNR- 100 - 2‘00” -cos( 1 —¢)+a, (6)

where 8, is (1120,0250) normally distributed noise; the mean level and
amplitude exponentially decay over time. The periodic datasets used in our
numerical experiments were generated by assigning different values to 1', ¢
and SNR. Compared with the stationary model, the non-stationary model is
more likely to approximate the circadian rhythm (Reﬁnetti, 2004).

The non-periodic time-series was generated from (p, :0, a: 1) normally
distributed white noise and AR processes of order one, AR(1), as suggested
by Futschik and Herzel (2008).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

ARSER was applied to both simulated and real microarray data.
A series of numerical experiments were designed to test and compare
the performance of ARSER with COSOPT and Fisher’s G-test. The
tasks were to (i) precisely estimate periodicity, (ii) separate periodic
from non-periodic signals and (iii) identify non-sinusoidal periodic
patterns.

3.1 Robustness to noise

In the ﬁrst experiment, we compared the robustness of three
algorithms to noise. We generated 10000 stationary [derived from
Equation (5)] and 10000 non-stationary periodic signals [derived
from Equation (6)] by the following steps: (i) taking 1' by 0.1-h
sampling interval in [20h,28h), (ii) at each period, taking <1) by
211/25 sampling interval in [0,211) and (iii) at each period and phase,
taking SNR of 5: 1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1. Each time-series possessed
12 data points, within 0—44 h at 4 h sampling intervals, which was
the same as the majority of published circadian microarray datasets.

There were 2000 periodic time-series under each SNR. We also
generated 2000 (11:00: 1) normally distributed random signals.
Then we applied ARSER, COSOPT and Fisher’s G-test to identify
periodic signals from the positive (periodic) and negative (random)
samples and measured their performance of periodicity prediction
under different SNRs by Matthew’s correlation coefﬁcient (MCC)
(Fig. 2A and B). The MCC is in essence a correlation coefﬁcient
between the observed and predicted binary classiﬁcations, with
values between —1 and +1. MCC =+1 represents a perfect
prediction, 0 an average random prediction and —1 an inverse
prediction (Baldi et (11., 2000).

Of the three methods, ARSER performed best at any noise-level
for both stationary and non-stationary time-series, suggesting it was
a robust periodicity detection algorithm.

3.2 Correctness for predicting wavelength

The task of precisely estimating periodicity included two parts:
identiﬁcation of truly periodic signals and the measurement of actual
wavelength. The former case was veriﬁed for the three algorithms
in the robustness experiment, and we continued to investigate the
latter one.

According to the predictions in the robustness experiment, we
calculated the differences for each periodic signal in its actual
period and predicted value by each algorithm. The distributions
of prediction errors for the three algorithms (Fig. 3) showed that
ARSER and COSOPT were more accurate (errors with zero means

and small variations) in predicting the period length compared with
Fisher’s G-test (errors of large variation). This indicates ARSER
and COSOPT are high-resolution detecting algorithms and can
accurately estimate the wavelength of circadian rhythms.

3.3 Periodicity detection with random background
models

To verify our algorithm, our second task was to separate periodic
from non-periodic signals, which measured the sensitivity and

speciﬁcity in the predictions.

(A) stationary and (B) non-stationary periodic signals under decreasing
signal-to-noise ratio. For each group of periodic signals, there are
1:1 negative sample data generated by (11:0,a:1) white noise. The
performance is measured by MCC. As noise intensity increased, ARSER
(blue) performed robustly with noise in both situations, while COSOPT
(red) and Fisher’s G-test (yellow) performed badly for stationary periodic
signals with high-level noise and even worse for non-stationary ones. They
all scored the signals as periodic using the threshold of 0.05 for FDR
q-value for ARSER and Fisher’s G-test, or by pMMC-ﬁ for COSOPT.
pMMC-ﬁ measures the probability for multiple testing, similarly to the FDR

The periodic signals generated in the robustness experiment
contained 10000 stationary and 10000 non-stationary time-series.
The non-periodic signals were generated by white noise and
AR(1) models with 10000 samples in each case. Then we created
four testing datasets by combining (i) stationary periodic signals
with white noise signals, (ii) non-stationary periodic signals with
white noise signals, (iii) stationary periodic signals with AR(1)-
based random signals and (iv) non-stationary periodic signals with
AR(1)-based random signals.

Since predictions were periodic or non-periodic, a well-suited
binary classiﬁcation, we applied receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves (Fawcett, 2006) to compare the performances of the
three algorithms on the four datasets (Fig. 4A—D). Performances
were measured by the area under the ROC curve criterion, with the
larger the area the better the method. ROC analysis showed that
ARSER outperformed COSOPT and Fisher’s G-test in all cases.

3.4 Detection of non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms

The last numerical experiment was to apply the three
algorithms to detect non-sinusoidal periodic patterns. The
testing dataset was downloaded from the HAYSTACK web site
(http://haystack.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/). This dataset included
ﬁve cycling patterns based on diurnal and circadian time-course
studies: rigid, spike, sine and two box-like patterns (Michael et (11.,
2008). Each periodic pattern contained 24 samples with the phase
shifted from 0 to 23h by 1h intervals. A total of 120 time-series
were contained in the dataset, which possessed 12 time-points
that represent two circadian cycles obtained at 4h sampling
intervals. We also added 120 (11:00: 1) white-noise signals as
negative data.

ARSER performed the best of the three algorithms (Fig. 5), and
identiﬁed more spike and box-like periodic pattern proﬁles while
maintaining a very low false positive rate.

3.5 Analysis of Arabidopsis circadian expression data

Our methodology for identifying periodicity of short time-series
worked successﬁilly on synthetic datasets. We applied ARSER
to analyze a real microarray dataset generated from the work of

system. The data (available from http://millar.bio.ed.ac.uk/data.htm)
are expression proﬁles of 13 data points, representing 48 h of
observation obtained at 4 h sampling intervals. In the original study,
the authors used COSOPT to identify cyclic genes. Of all 22810
genes represented on the array, 3504 genes were considered rhythmic
at the signiﬁcance threshold pMMC-B < 0.05.

Fig. 6. Area-proportional Venn diagram addresses the predictive power
of three algorithms for identifying Arabidopsis circadian-regulated genes.
The microarray data were originally analyzed by COSOPT in the study of
Edwards et a1. (2006), and scored 3504 genes as rhythmic (pMMC-ﬁ < 0.05).
A total of 4929 genes were identiﬁed by ARSER (FDR (1 <0.05), while
only 536 were found by Fisher’s G—test (FDR q < 0.05). Venn diagram was
generated by BioVenn tool (Hulsen et (11., 2008).

We re—analyzed this microarray data using ARSER and Fisher’s G-
test, both of which scored rhythmic transcripts by FDR q < 0.05, and
compared their predictions with those of COSOPT (Fig. 6). ARSER
identiﬁed 96% of the cycling transcripts identiﬁed by COSOPT,
suggesting our methodology efﬁciently reproduced the original
results, while Fisher’s G—test merely identiﬁed only 15%, implying
it may not efﬁciently analyze this circadian expression data.

In addition, a novel set of 1549 transcripts were uniquely
identiﬁed as rhythmic by ARSER. To examine these newly found
genes more closely, we employed principal component analysis
(Wall et (11., 2003) to Visualize the dominant expression patterns from
their proﬁles. The ﬁrst two principal components accounted for 70%
of the variance (Fig. 7A) and were cyclic with spike-like patterns
(Fig. 7B and C). These plots revealed a rhythmic component with
a period of ~24 h in many transcripts of the novel set, which was
consistent with the estimate using ARSER. These periodic patterns
were mainly non-sinusoidal and may explain why they were not
identiﬁed by COSOPT in the original study. The third component
also showed a linear trend (Fig. 7D), indicating the non-stationary
feature of the data. Dodd et (11. (2007) reported 27 well-known clock-
associated genes in Arabidopsis. Two of these genes were found
among the newly identiﬁed genes of the present study. One was
CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1), which ﬁinctions as a photoreceptor
for the circadian clock in a light-dependent fashion. In plants, the
blue light photoreception can be used to cue developmental signals
(Brautigarn et (11., 2004). The other one was PSEUDO-RESPONSE
REGULATORS 9 (PRR9), which plays an important role in response
to temperature signals in a temperature-sensitive circadian system
(Harmer, 2009) and acted as transcriptional repressors of CCA1 and
LHY in the feedback loop of the circadian clock (Nakamichi et (11.,
2010). Thus more clues could be provided by applying ARSER to
further study of Arabidopsis circadian expression data.

Unlike the synthetic datasets used in numeral experiments, the

Fig. 7. Principal component analysis of the newly found rhythmic transcripts
in Arabidopsis identiﬁed by ARSER. Plots of relative variance for the ﬁrst
nine components (A); and the ﬁrst (B), second (C) and third (D) eigengenes
are shown. The ﬁrst three principal components account for 78% of the
variance. The ﬁrst and second eigengenes are cyclic with spike-like patterns,
and the third shows a linear trend. These data reveal that non-sinusoidal and
non-stationary periodic transcripts could be found by applying ARSER. PCA
was carried out by Mev tool (Saeed et al., 2003).

data are not well deﬁned. Thus, we used the 27 known clock genes
as benchmark genes to evaluate a given algorithm in terms of false
negatives for analyzing circadian expression data. We applied three
algorithms to rank the 22 810 genes of the entireArabidopsis genome
in order of the statistical signiﬁcance of their expression proﬁles.
The rankings of the 27 known clock genes (Table 1) showed that the
three algorithms performed similarly, and all identiﬁed most of the
known clock genes from among their top 25% ranked candidates.

4 CONCLUSION

In this study, we present an automated algorithm for identifying
periodic patterns in large-scale temporal gene expression proﬁles.
It employs harmonic regression based on AR spectral analysis to
identify and model circadian rhythms. Compared with separate
frequency-domain or time-domain methods, our methodology is a
joint strategy which analyzes the time-series through both frequency
and time domains. Testing on synthetic and real microarray data
showed that our novel method was computationally optimal and
substantially more accurate than two existing and widely-used
rhythmicity detection techniques (COSOPT and Fisher’s G-test).

In addition, our method identiﬁes a novel set of rhythmically
expressed Arabidopsis genes which may supply more valuable
information for ﬁirther study of plant circadian systems.

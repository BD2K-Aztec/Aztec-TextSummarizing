a well established procedure. In brief, all sequenced reads are
aligned to mm9 mouse reference genome (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/) (Dreszer et al., 2012) using bowtie (version 0.12.7)
(Langrnead et al., 2009). All peaks are detected using the
model—based analysis for ChIP—Seq (MACS v.1.4.1) (Zhang
et al., 2008). The Poisson p—value cut—off for peak detection is
set to 10—5. Overlapped peaks are split using Mali Salmon’s Peak
Splitter program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bertone/software.html).
The peak annotation is done using R package ChIPpeakAnno
(Zhu et al., 2010).

NR—HMM was built using NR binding sites collected in pre—
vious work and JASPAR CORE (http://jaspar.cgb.ki.se/cgi—bin/
jaspar_db.pl) (Sandelin and Wasserrnan, 2005). The sequences of
the collected binding sites were manually inspected, and only
those with two half sites were kept. The ﬁnal dataset contained
151 NR binding sites. The NR—HMM model is built using the
framework of NHR—Scan (Sandelin and Wasserrnan, 2005). The
parameters of HMM were estimated using BaumiWelch algo—
rithm. The transmission probability matrix was estimated based
on the frequency of each state in the training data. Laplace’s rule
pseudo count was applied to estimate the emission probability
matrix. The NR—HMM is then used to predict NR binding sites
in mouse genome (mm9), available as a GBrowse track in
NURBS.

The NURBS is implemented as a MySQL relational database
and uses the Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) (Donlin,
2009) as its web browser based interface. GBrowse is user—
friendly and highly customizable. Links to the Mouse Genome
Informatics database (MGI, http://www.informatics.jax.org/) are
available in NURBS wherever possible. Because MGI also uses
GBrowse as its user interface, all MGI annotation trackers can
be easily downloaded and enabled in NURBS.

The main search page of NURBS is highly conﬁgurable by
users. Detailed examples are provided in an online help file. In
brief, users can click track buttons to select datasets for visual—
ization and comparison. The coverage option allows users to
choose whether to display the binding region intensities.
NURBS supports searches by name and region. A search
result page displays selected tracks of experimental data, pre—
dicted peaks by NR—HMM and annotations. A hypertext link
is available for a peak, leading to additional information, such as
sequence and genome location. Similarly, when an annotated
feature such as a gene is visible in the result page, a hyperlink
to the MGI database is provided so the users can access more
information such as genetic map position, mammalian homology
information, gene ontology and expression, as well as links to
other public databases such as Ensembl genome browser,
University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser
and NCBI.

3 CONCLUSON

We have developed NURBS, a web—based database for experi—
mental and predicted NR binding sites in mouse genome. It has a
customizable and user—friendly interface easy for navigating,
searching and comparing experimental and predicted NR bind—
ing sites for multiple NRs. All the data and the HMM model are
freely available for download. Currently, we are incorporating
transcriptome data in NURBS for more advanced studies and

expanding the database to human NRs for cross—species com—
parison. We intend to make NURBS a database open to the
community and encourage users to provide feedback and
submit new data and references. We have been actively populat—
ing the database and plan to maintain regular updates for the
years to come.

NURBS is distinct from other existing NR—related databases.
It is developed to provide researchers a convenient way to com—
pare experimental and predicted binding sites for various NRs,
along with genomic annotations. Other existing NR databases
are devoted to the sequences, structures and functions (Martinez
et al., 1998), mutations (Van Dunne et al., 2003; Vroling et al.,
2012) and phylogenies (Ruau et al., 2004) of NRs, not their
binding sites. Recently, Ochsner et a]. (2012) set—up a database,
Transcriptomine, which is focused on the expression and func—
tion of NRs—related genes. The well developed Cistrome (Tang
et al., 2011) provides information about a number of NRs and
their co—factors and epigenomic information, and it is better
suited for investigating individual NR, as it does not provide
features for comparison between NRs. In addition, Cistrome
dedicates genomic visualization to remote UCSC genome
browser, whereas NURBS uses an integrated GBrowse, also
used by MGI.

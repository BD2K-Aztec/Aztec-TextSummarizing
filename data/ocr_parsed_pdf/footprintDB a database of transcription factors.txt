the binding interfaces of the corresponding TFs. Furthermore,
we survey the redundancy of all included databases and compare
them with TRANSFAC, a subscription—based commercial alter—
native. Besides allowing users to compare DNA sequences/
motifs with records in the database, as most included repositories
do, footprintDB can also interrogate complete proteomes to
identify which TFs are likely to recognize input cis elements.
Annotated interfaces are particularly valuable for the second
type of query, as our benchmarks indicate that TFs with similar
interface residues are more likely to bind to similar DBSs. The
three unique features of footprintDB are as follows: (i) the pos—
sibility to search against multiple curated databases at the same
time or to add custom databases, (ii) the annotation of interface
residues within DNA binding protein domains and (iii) the sup—
port for browsing TFs within user—provided proteomes, which
are most likely to bind a DBS of interest. This resource is avail—
able at http://ﬂoresta.eead.csic.es/footprintdb.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

FootprintDB is by design a meta-database of TFs attached to their
experimentally determined DNA binding preferences (PSSMs and/or
DBSs). Therefore it does not incorporate other databases that contain
only TF, DBS or predicted regulatory sequences. The ﬁrst building block
is 3D-footprint (Contreras-Moreira, 2010), a database for the structural
analysis of proteiniDNA complexes, for two reasons: (i) it is to our
knowledge the only up-to-date source of annotated binding interfaces
of TFs, and (ii) it contains structure-based PSSMs, motifs inferred
from cis elements captured in X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance
complexes, that have been independently validated (AlQuraishi and
McAdams, 2011; Lin and Chen, 2013). The remaining databases and
repositories currently integrated in footprintDB are as follows:

(1) JASPAR CORE (2009 version, all species redundant set): a high-
quality collection of TF DNA binding preferences, modeled as
PSSMs (Portales-Casamar et al., 2010).

(2) UniPROBE (Universal PBM Resource for Oligonucleotide
Binding Evaluation, Sep 2012 version): it contains in vitro DNA
binding speciﬁcities of proteins measured with universal protein
binding microarrays (Robasky and Bulyk, 2011).

(3) ‘HumanTF’: a sequence-speciﬁc binding preferences of human TFs
obtained by high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing. It in-
cludes a total of 830 binding proﬁles, describing 239 distinctly
different binding speciﬁcities (Jolma et al., 2013).

(4) Athamap: a genome-wide map of potential TF binding sites in
Arabidopsis thaliana (Bulow et al., 2009).

RegulonDB (7.5 version): it contains curated data of the transcrip-
tional regulatory network of Escherichia coli K12, including
PSSMs and DBSs for many TFs (Salgado et al., 2013).

(6) DBTBS (Database of transcriptional regulation in Bacillus subti-
lis): a database of transcriptional regulation in B.subtilis (Sierro
et al., 2008).

‘DrosophilaTF’: motifs for 56 Drosophila melanogaster TFs built
from in vitro binding site selection experiments and compiled
genomic binding site sequences (Down at al., 2007).

In addition to these freely available data sources, we also tested
TRANSFAC (2012.1 version), a subscription database with TFs, their
experimentally proven binding sites and the corresponding PSSMs
(Matys et al., 2006). TRANSFAC is a popular resource in this

community and was thus included in our benchmarks. All these data
sets were retrieved, curated, completed when necessary (for instance by
searching for TF sequences for GenBank/Uniprot identiﬁers) and im-
ported into our meta-database using custom Perl scripts. To standardize
these tasks, we created the footprintDB data format, which bundles to-
gether TF and DBS sequences, motifs and links to supporting literature
and original sources. This format is a blending of ‘matrix.dat’, ‘factor.dat’
and ‘site.dat’ TRANSFAC ﬁles in a single ﬁle, as shown in
Supplementary Figure S2. By adopting these formats, a friendly web
interface allows users to update and insert data for their own private
applications, or rather make them available to the community.

Along the article we will refer to footprintDB as the sum of the for-
merly listed data sources, excluding TRANSFAC.

2.2 Database structure and web application

Different aspects were considered when conceiving the database, some of
them biological and some relevant for data modeling. Transcription con-
trol is a complex mechanism, still not completely understood, and this
must be considered in the design. For instance, a single TF can bind to
several possibly degenerate DBSs within the same or different genomic
regions, or often the same cis element is recognized by several TFs. Other
relevant questions are redundancy among sources, miscellaneous anno-
tation formats, incomplete annotation of entries and availability of data
retrieval systems. All these factors made footprintDB have a complex
relational schema, shown in Supplementary Figure S3. The web applica-
tion is written in PHP and JavaScript, with Perl scripts running the
queries. Sequence logos are built with Weblogo (Crooks et al., 2004).
The database runs a MySQL engine on an Apache server. A SOAP
web services interface is available at http://ﬁoresta.eead.csic.es/foot
printdb/ws.cgi. The online documentation includes examples on how to
query it.

2.3 Annotation of TF interfaces and Pfam domains

TF sequences in footprintDB have their DNA binding interfaces anno-
tated by means of BLASTP alignments (Altschul et al., 1990) against the
3D-footprint library (http://ﬁoresta.eead.csic.es/3dfootprint/download/
list_interface2dna.txt) with an E—value threshold of 10. Aligned interface
positions from one or more proteiniDNA complexes are thus transferred
to entries in the database. A benchmark with 127 TFs comparing other
machine learning interface-inference tools showed that this straightfor-
ward BLAST-based strategy is the most accurate among sequence-based
methods, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4.

Pfam domains (Punta et al., 2012) were also annotated for all TF
sequences using HMMSCAN from the HMMER 3.0 suite (Finn et al.,
2011). Family-speciﬁc E—value thresholds were optimized to reduce false-
positive matches, according to benchmark experiments summarized in
Supplementary Figure S5.

2.4 Analysis of data redundancy

Two kinds of redundancy were deﬁned and measured: internal and
external. Internal redundancy is deﬁned as the number of redundant
DNA motifs (PSSMs) and TF sequences from the same source, whereas
external redundancy is estimated with respect to other sources. Internal
redundancy of DNA motifs was measured aligning all PSSMs from the
same data source against each other with STAMP (Mahony and Benos,
2007), taking the best hit to deﬁne nearest neighbor clusters of similar
DNA motifs. Two E-value thresholds were tested to deﬁne redundancy,
1E-10 and 1E-5; motifs with lower E—values were clustered together and
labeled as redundant. Internal redundancy of TF sequences was measured
running CD-HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006). Two sequence identity thresh-
olds were tested, 90 and 50%, so that aligned sequences with higher
identity percentages were clustered together. External redundancy of

A.Sebastian and B. Contreras-Moreira

 

either DNA motifs or TFs was estimated comparing PSSMs or protein
sequences across data sources. External redundancy values estimate how
many data entries from each database have similar values in the other
databases. These values are asymmetrical because comparisons can be
made in both ways: A versus B and B versus A. Redundant data
among footprintDB, TRANSFAC and JASPAR CORE were clustered
and Euler diagrams drawn with eulerAPE v2.0 (available from http://
www.eulerdiagrams.org/eulerAPE), as depicted in Figure 3. These dia-
grams illustrate data redundancy among the three main repositories, con-
sidering that JASPAR CORE is by design contained in footprintDB.

2.5 Protein sequence and DNA motif search

The search engine of footprintDB relies on a Perl script that implements
protein sequence searches with BLASTP (Altschul et al., 1990) and DNA
motif scans with STAMP (Mahony and Benos, 2007). Protein searches
take FASTA format sequences as input and by default accept hits with a
maximum E—value of 1. Results can be ordered by increasing E—value or
by decreasing interface similarity. Interface similarity is calculated using a
scoring matrix that gives score 1 to amino acids with similar physico-
chemical properties and 0 to the rest (Supplementary Fig. S6). Motif
searches are carried out by STAMP using as input a PSSM in
TRANSFAC format. Other accepted inputs are single or multiple
DNA sequences, which will be internally converted to PSSMs. The align-
ment algorithm is an ungapped SmithiWaterman implementation, which
extends matched motifs with a maximum E—value of 1. The scoring func-
tion is the Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient of aligned matrix columns.
Motif similarity is deﬁned as the sum of column Pearson Correlation
Coefﬁcient values. Results can be ordered by increasing E—value or by
decreasing motif similarity. Besides these standard alignment scores, the
output table resulting from DNA searches is colored according to twilight
thresholds: green matches correspond to reliable motif alignments, where-
as motifs over a red background cannot be guaranteed to be correctly
aligned (Sebastian and Contreras-Moreira, 2013).

2.6 External proteome search

A remarkable feature of footprintDB is that it allows extending database
searches to external proteomes. By doing this, users can transfer search
results, which only consider annotated TFs and DNA motifs, to other
species of interest. This extension step requires running BLASTP with a
default E-value threshold of 0.01. Note that this parameter can be tuned.
When possible, resulting hits have their interface residues predicted, so
that they can be sorted with respect to the original annotated TFs in the
database.

2.7 Benchmark

Three test datasets and three representative species were chosen to bench-
mark the predictive ability of footprintDB: (i) A.thaliana data from
Athamap; (ii) E.c0[i data from RegulonDB and (iii) a subset of 100 ran-
domly selected DNA motifs and their associated TFs from ‘HumanTF’.
Each dataset consisted of DNA motifs recognized by a single TF and TFs
recognizing a single DNA motif. Benchmark searches were performed by
setting aside each test set from the meta-database, ﬁrst excluding and then
including annotated data for the corresponding species. Both protein and
DNA searches were evaluated:

(1) The TF benchmark consisted in scanning protein sequences against
footprintDB+TRANSFAC and then comparing the predicted
motifs to the cognate DNA motif of the query. If one of the
matched PSSMs is signiﬁcantly similar to the cognate motif
(STAMP E51E-5), the result is stored together with its rank,
E-value, motif similarity, BLASTP E—value, interface similarity,
organism and data source.

(2) The DNA benchmark was done by searching input motifs from all
three test datasets looking for putative binding homologous TFs
within the corresponding proteomes (versions: A.thaliana TAIR9,
E.c0[i U000096.2 and Homo sapiens GRCh37.58). Hits were com-
pared with the TF associated to the query and deﬁned as correct
with a percent sequence identity >90.

Figure 5 illustrates how the benchmark was done, and the sets of
obtained predictions are provided as Supplementary Material.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Database contents

The first release of footprintDB contains 2422 unique TF
sequences, 3662 PSSMs and 10 112 DBSs. As we added the con—
tents of TRANSFAC version 2012.1 to the analysis, these num—
bers increased signiﬁcantly to 4923, 5349 and 21 988, respectively
(see Table 1). In the next section, redundancy analyses are per—
formed to fairly evaluate the richness of each data source.

The most populated species among footprintDB sources, as
compared with TRANSFAC and JASPAR CORE, are shown in
Figure 1A, together with the corresponding number of TF se—
quences annotated in each data source (full statistics are reported
as Supplementary Material). We notice that the TF binding pref—
erences of a few organisms are widely covered, such as human,
mouse, yeast, ﬂy or Ecoli. This coverage could already be sufﬁ—
cient for many applications in the case of human or mouse,
considering current estimations of the repertoire of TFs in the
human genome (Vaquerizas et al., 2009). However, other species
such as Athaliana, maize or rice (among plants) or mammals like
cow, pig and sheep have a shallow coverage. Moreover, the ana—
lysis unveils that some organisms are better covered by
TRANSFAC (for instance Gallus gallus, Rattus norvegicus or
Xenopus Iaevis), whereas others, such as bacteria, are only con—
sidered by open—access libraries such as DBTBS. In the Section
2.7, we assess to what extent well—explored species can help make
predictions on the remaining.

The most frequent DNA binding domains found in the ana—
lyzed databases are also summarized in Figure 1B (see also
Supplementary Material). It can be seen that Homeobox and

“A redundant version of JASPAR was tested.

Note: The main diagonal shows the total number of PSSMs in each source (bold). Motifs aligned with STAMP E—values<1E—10 were called redundant. Second row
corresponds to the union of all individual data sources that contribute to footprintDB. Note that a large fraction of 3D—footprint entries are not called redundant within
footprintDB because their short DNA motifs fail to produce alignments with E—values< 1E—10.

sources (RegulonDB and DBTBS) and the rest. Note that exter—
nal redundancy estimates are asymmetrical, as different results
are obtained depending on the direction of the comparison.

The picture arising from the comparison of TF sequences
across data sources reveals their analogous levels of redundancy
(see Supplementary Table S6). For instance, 368 TRANSFAC
TFs have identical amino acid sequences in JASPAR; this ﬁgure
increases to 1062 if we apply a 90% sequence identity redun—
dancy cutoff.

After reviewing the full set of comparisons in Supplementary
Tables SS and S6, it can be concluded that there is an ‘eclipse
effect’: as we relax the redundancy thresholds, eukaryotic data—
sets progressively overlap till most of their contents turn to be
shared. This behavior is shown in the Euler diagrams in Figure 3
for the three main databases footprintDB, TRANSFAC and
JASPAR CORE (which is included in footprintDB).

Perhaps the most interesting case is the overlap between
footprintDB and TRANSFAC (Fig. 3, Table 2 and
Supplementary Tables SS and S6). They share 22% of motifs
and 14% of TRANSFAC TFs (Fig. 3A and D). If nearly iden—
tical DNA motifs (E g 1E—10) and TFs (with percent sequence
identity :90) are considered, these percentages increase to 71%
of motifs and 56% of TFs (Fig. 3B and E). Further relaxing these
thresholds to E g 1E—5 (short motifs or motifs that share a
common pattern but not the whole motif) and sequence identity
350% (proteins with common domain architecture) then both
databases are almost equivalent, as they seem to share 95% of
motifs and 98% of TFs (Fig. 3C and F). Such data overlap is
also noticeable for J ASPAR.

3.3 Web site

The web interface of footprintDB displays the main menu on the
left side, which provides access to the current list of publicly
available data sources and to the search engine, in addition to
the documentation (Supplementary Fig. S7). By default anonym—
ous users can perform any of these tasks:

(1) Listing the included repositories, their versions, references
and authors, with links to the original Web sites. From this

table it is possible to browse TFs, DNA binding motifs
(PSSMs) and DBSs curated in each individual data source.

(2) Accessing a single entry (TF, PSSM or DBS) to display all
the available information for that record, including refer—
ences to primary literature and experimental evidence, and
download them in TRANSFAC format (example in
Supplementary Fig. S8).

(3) Key word search of TF, PSSM or DBS accessions. The
form supports ﬁltering by database, organism or related
TF domain and results can be downloaded in
TRANSFAC format.

(4) Sequence search, to scan protein or DNA sequences and
PSSMs. The search process is explained in the next section.

In addition, registered users have access to the following extra
features:

(1) Storing and reusing previous searches.

(2) Inserting/removing their own databases in TRANSFAC
or footprintDB formats.

3.4 Search engines and external proteomes

The main purpose of footprintDB is to support searching for
annotated TFs and/or regulatory sequences, as depicted in
Figure 4. The search engine is designed primarily to receive
two types of queries: (i) a DNA consensus motif, PSSM or site
and (ii) a protein sequence of a putative DNA binding protein.
Therefore, two kinds of output will be produced, respectively, (i)
a list of DNA binding proteins predicted to bind a similar DNA
motif and (ii) a list of DNA motifs recognized by similar proteins
annotated in any of the included data sources. Search results can
be sorted by E—value, motif similarity or interface similarity.
Moreover, the user can also look for homologs in a third party
species, by simply specifying an appropriate proteome in the
formulary dropdown list or by uploading a custom proteome
in FASTA format. Together with the standard search results,
this option produces a list of homologous proteins with their
interfaces annotated. Interface predictions can then be used to
filter out BLASTP hits displaying a signiﬁcantly different set of

in terms of the intrinsic redundancy of the PDB. With respect to
‘HumanTF’, the observed redundancy is due to the fact that this
source includes both complete protein sequences and domains of
orthologous TFs from mouse and human. A similar explanation
is valid for TRANSFAC, which appears to frequently annotate
orthologous TFs from relates species. Inspection of the resulting
clusters suggests that most redundant TFs at 90% of sequence
identity are probably inparalogs and orthologs from phylogen—
etically close organisms. Inspection of relaxed clusters (50%
sequence identity cutoff) unveils that they gain more divergent
homologous proteins of the same family, which bind to regula—
tory elements using the same Pfam domains.

Although our survey reveals a comprehensive coverage
of human and murine TFs, both in TRANSFAC and in open—
access repositories, it also shows that prokaryotes are still
only served by specialized expert—curated resources such as
RegulonDB and DBTBS. In fact these organism—speciﬁc reposi—
tories are reported to be the least redundant (as also observed for
DrosophilaTF). By combining freely available data sources,
footprintDB aims to be a reference meta—database covering bac—
teria, plants and animals, although our benchmark clearly shows
that its predictive power is greater for multicellular organisms.
Despite the wide coverage of this meta—database, our benchmarks
encourage the addition of any other relevant high—quality re—
sources/datasets, as we found out with the plant regulatory data.
For this reason the web interface allows users to import their own
data collections, which can optionally be shared with other users,
and we hope that the adoption of this tool by the community will
translate into a richer set of curated data repositories.

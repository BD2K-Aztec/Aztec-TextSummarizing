Abstract

Summary: A new freely available web server site of metabolism predictor to predict the sites
of metabolism (SOM) based on the structural formula of chemicals has been developed. It is
based on the analyses of ’structure—SOM’ relationships using a Bayesian approach and
labelled multilevel neighbourhoods of atoms descriptors to represent the structures of over
1000 metabolized xenobiotics. The server allows predicting SOMs that are catalysed by 1A2,
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 isoforms of cytochrome P450 and enzymes of the UDP—glucuronosyl—
transferase family. The average invariant accuracy of prediction that was calculated for the

 

training sets (using leave—one—out cross—validation)
respectively.

and evaluation sets is 0.9 and 0.95,

Availability and implementation: Freely available on the web at http://www.way2drug.com/SOMP.

1 Introduction

Drug metabolism affects the drug efficiency and toxicity and is div-
ided into Phase I (oxidation, hydrolysis, reduction) and Phase II
(conjugation) reactions. Cytochromes P450 (CYP) are the main en-
zymes of Phase I (Lewis and Ito, 2008; Williams et (11., 2004), which
metabolize most drugs. Glucuronidation is the main reaction of
Phase II, which is catalysed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)
and serves as a clearance mechanism for drugs from many thera-
peutic classes (King et (11., 2000). Prediction of the sites of metabol-
ism (SOM) is important during the drug discovery process to detect
possible ‘metabolic hot spots’ in lead compounds that can be modi-
fied to obtain more metabolically stable compounds. The SOM pre-
diction can be used for an integral estimation of activity and toxicity
of a compound including its possible metabolites.

There are two freely available web servers, which allow predict-
ing SOMs for xenobiotics that are metabolized by P450 isoenzymes.
SmartCyp predicts SOMs for compounds that are metabolized by
CYPZC and (IYP2D6 (Rydberg et (11., 2010), and RS-WebPredictor
(Zaretzki et (11., 2013) predicts SOMs for nine CYP isoforms (1A2,
2A6, 2B6, zcs, 2C9, 2(119, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4).

We have previously developed a method to predict SOMs
(Rudik et (11., 2014) by using only structural formulae, which distin-
guishes from traditional SUM-predicting methods that use molecu-
lar docking and molecular dynamics or quantum mechanical and
semi-empirical calculations.

The detailed description of the algorithm was published
(Filimonov et (11., 2014; Rudik et (11., 2014) and shown in the
Supplementary text $1. In this article, we highlight the extension of

web server has reasonable prediction accuracy and may be used to
study the drug metabolism.

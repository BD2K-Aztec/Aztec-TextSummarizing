To visualize the analytical results, we provide automatic plot—
ting, e. g. Manhattan plots for logged P—values and variance ex—
plained, or heat—map for distributions from Bayesian analysis.
An advantage of using HDFS for storing the data is that users
can use HDFSView, a GUI provided by the HDFS group, to
view the compressed raw genotype data. Users can then easily
view details of interesting or suspicious results.

The core program and libraries are written in Java, so that
users do not need to install any third—party library and can
simply copy and run our executable, regardless of type of ma—
chine or operating system (‘batteries—included’ solution).

To facilitate GWAS using genotypes that are quantitative, e. g.
copy number variants or methylation levels, in all functions of
JAWAMix5, storing and analyzing genotypes as ﬂoating num—
bers are also supported.

3 PERFORMANCE

Given that the data are stored on disk instead of in RAM, one
might expect slower runtimes compared with the traditional so—
lution of putting data into RAM (in the event that one does have
the resources). We tested the performance in the following two
experiments: first, we compare our HDFS—based solution with
our own RAM—based implementation to see what is the overhead
brought by HDFS; second, we compare core functions of
JAWAMix5 with other existing tools: EMMAX (Kang et al.,
2010), PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) and GCTA (Yang et al.,
2011) (GCTA is originally for estimating variance component
of the whole chromosome. We make use of it for local region
by generating .bed ﬁles using variants of focal region and code
them with the same chromosome id.).

We analyzed our sequences data (~6 million SNPs times 400
individuals) in The 1001 Genomes Project (www.1001 genomes.
org) and found that performance is good: in the worse case,
JAWAMix5 is ~20% slower than the RAM—based solutions,
whereas in some cases, it is even faster. Detailed comparisons
are listed in Table 1. Memory wise, JAWAMix5 uses <500 MB
RAM regardless of the amount of the data, whereas the memory

usage of memory—based solutions increases linearly proportional
to the size of the data.

Then we run existing tools that generated same results. The
comparisons between JAWAMix5 and existing tools are pre—
sented in Table 2. Details of how the tools are used are in
Supplementary Notes.

In addition to testing it on Arabidopsis data, we also run
JAWAMix5 on human data using Phase I data of The 1000
Genomes Project (www.1000genomes.org) with our simulated
random phenotype. In all, it took 18h, which is comparable
with EMMAX that spent 21 h.

4 FUTURE WORK

Immediately planned extensions are geneigene interaction ana—
lysis and the annotations based on existing known gene models
and functions. Another extension we are working on is the
HDFS interface for storing methylation data. Additionally,
more functions for RNA—Seq expression analysis will be added.

Although the novel Bayesian method in JAWAMix5 has re—
vealed new biological insight in Arabidopsis data (Supplementary
Notes), it has not been rigorously validated with extensive simu—
lations. We plan to do it in the future work.

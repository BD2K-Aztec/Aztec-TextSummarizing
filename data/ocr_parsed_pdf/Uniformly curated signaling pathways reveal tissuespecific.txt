ABSTRACT

Motivation: Signaling pathways control a large variety of cellular
processes. However, currently, even within the same database
signaling pathways are often curated at different levels of detail. This
makes comparative and cross-talk analyses difficult.

Results: We present SignaLink, a database containing eight
major signaling pathways from Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
melanogaster and humans. Based on 170 review and ~800 research
articles, we have compiled pathways with semi-automatic searches
and uniform, well-documented curation rules. We found that in
humans any two of the eight pathways can cross-talk. We quantified
the possible tissue- and cancer-specific activity of cross-talks and
found pathway-specific expression profiles. In addition, we identified
327 proteins relevant for drug target discovery.

Conclusions: We provide a novel resource for comparative
and cross-talk analyses of signaling pathways. The identified
multi-pathway and tissue-specific cross-talks contribute to the
understanding of the signaling complexity in health and disease, and
underscore its importance in network-based drug target selection.

1 INTRODUCTION

Intracellular signaling, from the simplest cascades to the highly
intertwined networks of protein kinases, contributes extensively to
the diversity of developmental programs and adaptation responses in
metazoans (Pires-daSilva and Sommer, 2003). In humans, defects
in intracellular signaling can cause various diseases, e.g. cancer,
neurodegeneration or diabetes. Thus, understanding the structure,
function and evolution of signal transduction is an important task
for both basic research and medicine. By now genetic studies have

uncovered functionally separate, though interacting (cross-talking),
pathways and the direction of information ﬂow between pairs of
signaling molecules in a number of species (Beyer et (11., 2007). On
the other hand, biochemical experiments have allowed the detailed
Characterization of direct physical interactions involved in signaling
(Xia et (11., 2004). Integrating these data sets using uniform manual
curation criteria can signiﬁcantly contribute to a more precise
assessment of their tissue- and cancer-speciﬁc utilization and the
effects of drug treatments (Davidov et (11., 2003). For example,
inhibitors used for eliminating a signaling pathway in cancerous
cells may in fact have the opposite effect. These drugs may suppress
negative feedback loops and thereby, paradoxically, activate the
targeted pathway (Sergina et (11., 2007).

Intracellular signaling was originally regarded as an assembly of
distinct and almost linear cascades. Over the past decade, however,
it has been realized that signaling pathways are highly structured
and rich in cross-talks (where cross-talk is deﬁned here as a directed
physical interaction between pathways). Consequently, intracellular
signaling is now viewed as a set of intertwined pathways forming
a single signaling network (Papin et (11., 2005). This paradigm
shift calls for novel experimental, curation and network modeling
techniques (Bauer-Mehren et (11., 2009).

Currently, high-throughput (HTP) experiments are the major
sources of known protein—protein interactions (PPIs). However,
so far in most HTP experiments extracellular, membrane-bound
and nuclear proteins have been underrepresented. These and other
sampling biases strongly reduce their usability for identifying
signaling interactions. Another limitation of HTP assays is that they
produce undirected interactions even though in signaling directions
are essential. Accordingly, several signaling pathway databases
have been created recently by manually collecting the directed
interactions from the literature (Bauer-Mehren et (11., 2009).

Manually curated signaling pathway databases are often
assembled without strictly deﬁned and published standardized
curation criteria (Lu et (11., 2007). Therefore, even within the
same database, e.g. in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes; Ogata et (11., 1999), the level of detail of curation and the
rules for setting pathway boundaries can vary among pathways. In
addition, in several signaling resources the deﬁnition of signaling
pathways has no evolutionary or biochemical background. In other
cases, e.g. in Reactome and NetPath (Joshi-Tope et (11., 2005;

Only the differences from SignaLink are listed. The features setting SignaLink most clearly apart have a gray background.

Kandasamy et (11., 2010), curation criteria are standardized; however,
(i) pathways are usually handled as separate entities; (ii) cross-talks
and multi-pathway proteins are underrepresented; and (iii) extracting
signaling information from the databases is complicated and labor-
intensive, see Section 4 and Supplementary Material for details.
Another limitation of several current signaling resources is that
they neglect the importance of multi-pathway proteins, i.e. proteins
functioning in more than one pathway (Komarova et (11., 2005). In
summary, the manual curation process needs to be uniform across all
pathways and species to aid cross-talk analyses, tests of evolutionary
hypotheses, dynamical modeling, setting up predictions and drug
target selection (Table 1).

We present SignaLink, a signaling resource compiled by applying
uniform manual curation rules and data structures across eight
major, biochemically deﬁned signaling pathways in three metazoans
(Fig. l). The curation method allowed a systematic comparison of
pathway sizes and cross-talks. We found that in humans any two
of the eight pathways can cross-talk, and in humans we compared
the possible dynamic activities of both the pathways and their
cross-talks. We Characterized tissue- and cancer-speciﬁc expression
proﬁles, and identiﬁed proteins relevant for drug target discovery.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Signaling proteins and interactions

SignaLink lists signaling proteins and directed signaling interactions between
pairs of proteins in healthy cells of Caenorhabditis elegans. Drosophila
melanogaster and Homo sapiens. Each interaction is documented with
the PubMed ID of the publication reporting the verifying experiment(s).
SignaLink was compiled separately for all pathways of the three organisms.
Search functions. data and network images of the pathways are available at
http://SignaLink.org.

In each of the three organisms. we ﬁrst listed signaling proteins and
interactions from reviews (and from WormBook in Celegans) and then
added further signaling interactions of the listed proteins. To identify
additional interactions in Celegans. we examined all interactions (except
for transcription regulation) of the signaling proteins listed in WormBase
(Rogers et (11.. 2008) and added only those to SignaLink that we could
manually identify in the literature as an experimentally veriﬁed signaling

interaction. For D.melan0gaster. we added to SignaLink those genetic
interactions from FlyBase (Drysdale. 2008) that were also reported in at
least one yeast-2-hybrid experiment. For humans. we manually checked the
reliability and directions for the PPIs found with the search engines iHop
and Chilibot (Chen and Sharp. 2004; Hoffmann and Valencia. 2004).

SignaLink assigns proteins to signaling pathways using the full texts
of pathway reviews (written by pathway experts). While most signaling
resources consider 5715 reviews per pathway. SignaLink uses a total of
170 review papers. i.e. more than 20 per pathway on average. Interactions
were curated from a total of 941 articles (PubMed IDs are available at the
website). We added a small number of proteins based on InParanoid ortholog
clusters (Berglund at (11.. 2008). For curation. we used a self-developed
graphical tool and Perl/Python scripts. The current version of SignaLink
was completed in May 2008 based on WormBase (version 191). FlyBase
(2008.6). Ensembl (49). UniProt (87) and the publications listed on the
website. Pathway data can be downloaded in several formats: SQL. CSV.
XLS. CYS and SVG exported from Cytoscape and SBML.

2.2 Quality control, database validation and statistical
signiﬁcance tests

The curation protocol of SignaLink (Fig. 1A) contains several steps aimed
speciﬁcally at reducing data and curation errors. We used reviews as a starting
point. manually looked up interactions three times. and manually searched
for interactions of known signaling proteins with no signaling interactions so
far in the database. The section ‘Advantages and limitations of SignaLink’
explains validation steps and results in detail. We performed functional
signiﬁcance tests for each of the signaling pathways and their overlaps. i.e.
multi-pathway proteins. with the ‘GO Termﬁnder’ toolbox (Boyle at (11..
2004). We found a signiﬁcant functional similarity between the functions of
multi-pathway proteins and the functions of their pathways compared to the
control case (functional similarity between the functions of all proteins and
all pathways). Moreover. we statistically evaluated the human interactions
listed in SignaLink with the PRINCESS web service (Li et (11.. 2008) and
found that the ratio of high conﬁdence interactions is 90.6%. Details for all
statistical signiﬁcance tests are available in the Supplementary Material.

2.3 Expression in selected healthy tissues and liver
carcinomas

process of the tissues and controls in the Supplementary Material). Protein
expression data in healthy tissue types were downloaded from the eGenetics
database (integrated into Ensembl). Protein expression data in two screens of
liver carcinomas were obtained from Oncomine 3.6 (Rhodes 21111.. 2007). We
considered a protein differentially expressed if the P-Value of its expression
in at least one of the two screens. as compared to healthy liver tissues and
computed by a t-test of Oncomine. was below 0.05.

2.4 Functional annotation of drug target candidates

We collected information on the proteins that can be relevant in drug
target discovery with DAVID (Database for Annotation. Visualization. and
Integrated Discovery; Dennis. Jr. at 611.. 2003). We downloaded disease-
related annotations from OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man).

2009; Becker at 611., 2004; O’Brien at 611.. 2004). domain information
from InterPRO (Hunter at 611.. 2009). and molecular function and cellular
component data from Gene Ontology (GO; Harris at 611.. 2004).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Uniform compilation of signaling pathways in three
metazoan species

We curated the signaling pathways of the nematode C.e1eg(1ns, the
fruit ﬂy D.me1(1n0g(1ster, and H.S(1piens. From the wide variety of

Classiﬁcation schemes for selecting signaling pathways (Bader et (11.,
2006), we followed the biochemical approach of Pires-daSilva and
Sommer (2003). We selected eight major pathways for curation—
EGF/MAPK, Ins/IGF, TGF-ﬂ, WNT, Hh (Hedgehog), JAK/STAT,
Notch and NHR (Nuclear Hormone Receptors)—that have central
roles both in development and in normal cellular signaling.
SignaLink is a manually compiled resource integrating
experimentally conﬁrmed genetic and physical interactions from
healthy tissue types. Proteins and interactions are listed without
tissue-speciﬁcity and can be visualized as networks of potential
interactions. Tissue- and disease-speciﬁc information can be
added easily as shown in the examples below. Five combined
Characteristics create the unique utility of SignaLink.

(l) Pathways are biochemically deﬁned and encompass all major
developmental signaling mechanisms.

(2) A protein can belong to more than one pathway (if it does,
then it is called a multi-pathway protein).

(3) Proteins are tagged with (i) the pathway(s), (ii) pathway
region(s) (core and peripheral) and (iii) the pathway
sections (one or two of: ligand, receptor, mediator, co-factor,
transcription factor and other) they belong to.

(4) The level of detail is the same for the entire database.

(5) Interactions are directed and manually labeled with PubMed
IDs (experimental evidence).

Currently, SignaLink lists 560 proteins and 237 interactions from
C.e1eg(1ns, 344 proteins and 233 interactions from D.me1(1n0g(1ster
and 646 proteins with 991 interactions from humans. Similarities and
differences between species and pathways are shown in Figures 1B
and 1C. The database, its help pages, a detailed description of the
curation process, and network visualizations of all pathways are
available at http://SignaLink.org.

3.2 A large-scale View of species-speciﬁc pathway and
pathway section sizes

In all three organisms, a few of the eight pathways are central and
abundant. Of all proteins, 26—38% participate in the EGF/MAPK
and WNT pathways, respectively. Other pathways with high protein
numbers are NHR in the worm, Hh and Notch in the ﬂy, and TGF
and JAK/STAT in humans. Altogether in each species 68—85% of
all signaling proteins participate in these pathways and 56—70% of
all cross-talks involve the EGF/MAPK, TGF or WNT pathways.
C.e1eg(1ns has almost identical numbers of core and peripheral
proteins in each pathway (except for Notch and NHR), while in
the other two species the ratio of core to peripheral proteins is
around 1.5.

Pathway size differences between the three species are often
related to the different environments to which the cells of these
organisms have adapted. For example, ligands from the environment
can easily reach the nuclei of the worm’s cells, thus, the worm’s NHR
pathway is exceptionally large (58% of all signaling proteins). On
the other hand, due to the large variety of signals that human cells are
exposed to the human JAK/STAT pathway is oversized compared
to the other two species (21% of all signaling proteins in humans
versus 0% and 4% in Celegans and Drosophila, respectively).

In all three species, EGF/MAPK and IGF have high number of
mediators. However, environmental differences may affect pathway
section sizes too. In C. elegans transcription factors—dominated
by the NHR pathway—are the largest pathway section (39%). In
the other two species, co-factors by far outnumber other pathway
sections (32—42%) and in humans JAK/STAT ligands and receptors
are abundant.

3.3 Multi-pathway proteins: proteins functioning in
more than one signaling pathway

In C.e1eg(1ns, D.me1(1n0g(1ster and humans, we found 6, 12 and 62
multi-pathway proteins, respectively. Within one human signaling
pathway the ratio of proteins functioning in at least one other
pathway varies from 5% (Notch) to 46% (IGF). Interestingly, a
single protein can be even a central (i.e. core) component in more
than one pathway. For example, the scaffold protein AXIN and the
kinase GSK3 are both core components of more than one signaling
pathway (Frame and Cohen, 2001; Luo and Lin, 2004).

We found that EGF/MAPK—the largest pathway—is the only
one sharing proteins with all other pathways. On the other end
of the spectrum are the Notch, JAK/STAT and NHR pathways:
their proteins are contained by three or four other pathways. These
differences correlate well with the numbers of pathway functions.
Note also that the set of 62 human multi-pathway proteins is enriched
with disease-related proteins: 45% (28) of them are known to be

Fig. 2. Maps of signaling cross-talk in three metazoans integrating manually
curated data from healthy tissue types. Pathway cores are indicated by darker
colors. The width of a link between two pathways is proportional to the
(weighted) number of directed signaling interactions (cross-talks) between
the two pathways. A directed signaling interaction between two proteins
annotated to n and m pathways, respectively, adds 1/(nm) to the weight
between any two of the directed pathway pairs connected by this interaction.

disease-related, while in the eight human signaling pathways only
25.5% (165 of 646) and among all human proteins listed by Ensembl
only 20% (3929 of 19 534). For both comparisons P < 0.001.

3.4 Cross-species comparison of cross-talks

Next, we focused on how the complexity of intracellular signaling
increases with a growing complexity of the organisms. In C.e1eg(1ns
only six of the eight curated pathways are active, and the Notch
pathway is isolated (Fig. 2A). In addition, the cross-talk network of
the pathways—where nodes represent pathways and links represent
cross-talks—is sparse. Between the six active pathways only 5 of

 

2045

112 /3.Io's[BumoprOJXO'sorquJOJHrorq”:duq uroiJ popao1umoq

9103 ‘1gisn8nv 110::

T.Korcsm ros et al.

 

the 30 ( = 6 X5 ) possible cross-talk types are present. In Drosophila,
all eight curated pathways of SignaLink are active, but the NHR and
JAK/STAT pathways are still isolated. Without these two pathways,
the cross-talk network is already signiﬁcantly denser than in the
worm: 16 of the total 30 possible cross-talk types are present
(Fig. 2B). In humans (the most complex organism of the three),
all eight curated signaling pathways are active and almost all of the
56 possible cross-talk types are possible (Fig. 2C). The ubiquity of
cross-talks (all 28 pathway pairs can cross-talk) expands both the
repertoire of possible phenotypes and the system-level responses to
environmental and pathological Changes.

In C. elegans cross-talk is possible through receptors, mediators
and transcription factors (Fig. 2D). In the other two species,
all pathway sections can participate in cross-talk, except for the
NHR and JAK/STAT pathways of Drosophila, where cross-talk
occurs mostly at the transcriptional level and through mediators,
respectively (Fig. 2E and F).

In addition to the number of active pathways and cross-talks, a
further important indicator of signaling complexity is the number of
cross-talks relative to all signaling interactions. In the worm 4.6%
of all signaling interactions are cross-talks, in the ﬂy 10.5% and in
humans 30.3%. Interestingly, the growth of the number of cross-
talks from worm to ﬂy and human is not simply due to the growth
of the number of protein-coding genes (20 100, 13 800 and 23 000,
respectively) or the number of signaling-related PubMed articles
(3889, 11 367 and 214 193 in worms, ﬂies and humans, respectively).

The presence of cross-talks in many pathways and pathway
sections is a sign of the efﬁcient utilization of resources: expanding
the functions of an already existing pathway protein is more
efﬁcient than evolving a novel protein (Bhattacharyya et (11., 2006).
Given the high number of signaling cross-talks, a large variety of
speciﬁc and robust phenotypes may emerge (Taniguchi et (11., 2006).
However, the actual signaling responses are controlled mainly by
scaffold proteins, feedback loops, kinetic insulation, and the spatial
and temporal expression patterns of proteins (Behar et (11., 2007;
Bhattacharyya et (11., 2006; Freeman, 2000; Kholodenko, 2006).
To map some of these possibilities, we investigated the dynamical
activity of signaling cross-talks in humans where cross-talk was
found ubiquitous.

3.5 Tissue- and disease-speciﬁc activity of cross-talks

Cross-talks, similar to other PPIs, are not active permanently in all
tissue types. We considered an interaction to be possibly active in a
given tissue type, if both of the mRNAs of its participating proteins
are expressed in that tissue. It is reasonable to assume (as a simple
approximation) that proteins whose mRNAs are expressed could be
active in the given tissue (compared to those that are not transcribed).
After merging SignaLink with protein expression proﬁles from
human colorectal, muscle, skin, liver and cardiovascular tissues,
we quantiﬁed the possible tissue-speciﬁc activity of cross-talks.
We found that cross-talks between the pathways EGF/MAPK and
TGF, and cross-talks from WNT to TGF and from EGF/MAPK to
JAK/STAT are overrepresented (Wald-test, upper limit: 7.25%) The
complete statistical test is available in the Supplementary Material.
In addition, we found that (i) the Notch and NHR pathways are the
least connected to other pathways and (ii) Notch and JAK/STAT
are the least and most frequently used pathways, respectively: on

average 26% and 48% of their proteins are expressed in the selected
healthy tissue types (Fig. 3A).

Cancers are often viewed as systems diseases (Homberg et (11.,
2006). In cancer cells large-scale modiﬁcations of signaling
pathways, especially Changes of cross-talks (Stelling et (11., 2004),
are prevalent. Accordingly, detecting which proteins (cross-talks)
are differentially expressed (active) in a carcinoma tissue may point
out key causes of the given tumour and can help the identiﬁcation of
novel, systems-based drug targets (Korcsmaros et (11., 2007; Tortora
et (11., 2004). To do this, we merged the network of eight human
signaling pathways with protein expression data from human liver
carcinomas. We considered a signaling interaction to be altered in
these two liver carcinomas, if, compared to healthy liver tissues, at

least one of the participating proteins was differentially expressed
(see Section 2 for details). In three of the eight pathways (WNT,
NHR and J AK/STAT) only ~30% of all proteins were differentially
expressed in the investigated liver carcinomas, while in the other
ﬁve pathways this ratio was ~50% (Fig. 3B).

In summary, the largest signaling pathway, EGF/MAPK, is
frequently used in the selected tissue types and signiﬁcantly Changed
in the two liver carcinomas. J AK/STAT is also strongly used, but less
modiﬁed in the two investigated liver carcinomas. A third example
is Notch, which is neither strongly used nor strongly modiﬁed. Thus,
even though cross-talks are possible between all pairs of investigated
human signaling pathways, the possible activity of these pathways
in healthy tissues and the modiﬁcations of their cross-talks in the
analyzed cancer types are highly diverse. See the Supplementary
Material for additional literature support.

3.6 Potential role of cross-talking proteins in drug
target discovery

Signaling proteins are overrepresented among human disease genes
(Sakharkar et (11., 2007) and are intensively studied as potential
drug target candidates (Chaudhuri and Chant, 2005), often with
network-based methods (Berger and Iyengar, 2009). Among the
62 human multi-pathway proteins, 21 (33.8%) are known drug
targets compared to 15% (94 of 646) in all 8 pathways and 8.2%
(1610 of 19534) among all human proteins. This implies that the
remaining set of 41 human multi-pathway proteins may also be
relevant for drug target discovery. In summary, the following two
sets, altogether 327 proteins in our current study, are likely to
be enriched with possible drug targets: (i) human multi-pathway
proteins and (ii) proteins participating in cancer-related cross-talks.

We analyzed the drug target relevance of human signaling proteins
by examining four key properties: disease-relatedness, localization
in the plasma membrane (Gao et (11., 2008; Yildirim et (11., 2007),
enzymatic functions and kinase domain content (Fabbro et (11.,
2002). To identify the most promising drug target candidates from
the 327 proteins selected in the previous paragraph, we ﬁrst listed
those nine that have all four key properties, i.e. disease-related
enzymes (with a kinase domain) localized in the membrane (Fig. 4).
Out of these nine proteins ﬁve (CASK, EGFR, ErbB2, IGFlR,
and INSR) are currently used as drug targets, while the other
four (IRAKl, MAP3K13/LZK/MLK, ROR2 and TGFBRl) are not.
ROR2 is essential during bone formation (Liu et (11., 2007) and the
other three proteins are inﬂammation-related factors (Klein et (11.,
2001). Interestingly, ROR2 was recently suggested as a therapeutic
target for osteosarcoma based on expression analysis and siRNA
treatment (Morioka et (11., 2009). As for IRAKl, TGFBRl and
MLK, anti-inﬂammatory drugs (imiquimod, dexamethasone and L-
arginine, respectively) frequently affect their pathways, but without
sufﬁcient speciﬁcity (Klein et (11., 2001). These ﬁndings support our
predictions that these four human signaling proteins are promising
novel drug targets.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Advantages and limitations of SignaLink

According to a recent study (Cusick et (11., 2009), manual curation
projects: (i) inherit the selection biases of the curated experiments;
(ii) often lack the speciﬁc goals Clearly deﬁning the curation

criteria; and (iii) it is usually difﬁcult to estimate their completeness
and reliability. Note, however, that many signaling proteins function
outside the cell (ligands), in membrane-bound positions (receptors),
or in the nucleus (transcription factors), and that proteins from these
compartments are underrepresented in current HTP data. Thus, for
the purpose of identifying signaling proteins and interactions HTP
techniques seem to be less adequate than those manual curation
projects that have Clear goals. In the case of SignaLink, the precisely
deﬁned curation process combines original research articles and
reviews, thus, both experimental evidence and its critical discussion
by specialists are included.

Applying a biochemically based, well-documented and Clear
pathway deﬁnition is central to SignaLink. For example, the
EGF/MAPK pathway in SignaLink contains (with evolutionary and
biochemical reasoning) the pathway from the EGF ligand to the
terminal MAPK kinases. In several other databases, this pathway
is scattered across many separate (sub)pathways (e.g. EGFR, RAS,
p38, JNK, ERK and ASK). An important consequence of precise
pathway deﬁnitions is the reduced number of examined pathways.
We suggest that appropriate and precise grouping, avoiding artiﬁcial
pathway constructs, may be a better indicator of the goodness of the
resource than merely the large number of pathways.

In each pairwise comparison, we compared only the pathways curated in both databases. In KEGG, only protein complexes and their interactions were available and we constructed
a list of binary interactions, i.e. a network, with the ‘matrix’ method (Bader and Hogue, 2002).

bBinary interactions from membership in the same complex.

dFor each directed interaction between two protein groups (KEGG complexes), we added a directed link between each protein of the source group and each protein of the target

group.

eWeighted cross-talk interaction number: a directed signaling interaction between two proteins annotated to n and m pathways, respectively, adds 1/(nm) to the weight between any
two of the directed pathway pairs connected by this interaction. See the Supplementary Material for further details.

Cross-talks (in italics) are a subgroup of all interactions.

Of the constantly increasing number of signaling databases (Bader
et (11., 2006) many are proprietary, list fewer than 200 molecules, or
only selected types of pathway components, e.g. protein kinases.
Even among the few databases passing these criteria (free for
academic use, more than 200 molecules, all pathway component
types included) there are currently no gold standards compiled
with similar goals and methods as SignaLink. It is, therefore,
important to compare both the curation protocols and the actual
data of several available databases before selecting one of them
for a particular analysis. In Table 2, we compare three widely
used pathway databases—KEGG, Reactome, and NetPath—and
SignaLink (see the Supplementary Material for details). In each
pairwise comparison, we used the pathways available in both
databases.

According to Table 2 and the Supplementary Material, SignaLink
has the following advantages compared to the three analyzed
databases: (i) precisely deﬁned and documented curation protocol;
(ii) highest numbers of signaling proteins and interactions in the
curated signaling pathways; (iii) highest numbers of cross-talks
and multi-pathway proteins; (iv) largest protein overlap with the
other databases; (v) a higher than average number of publications
used per pathway; (vi) minimal usage of protein isoform names;
(vii) no binary interactions inferred from the membership of two
proteins in the same complex; (viii) low number of proteins from
UniProt/TrEMBL (i.e., few unveriﬁed proteins). SignaLink was
compiled based on pathway reviews and primary research articles.
Thus, the high numbers of signaling proteins (including multi-
pathway proteins) and cross-talks are likely to be dominated by true
positives, indicating higher precision and coverage.

Despite the care we have taken in creating SignaLink, it does
have limitations, e.g., SignaLink does not contain all signaling
proteins. Only those signaling proteins have been included that
have an experimentally veriﬁed function in the selected eight major
pathways or a directed interaction with at least one of their proteins.
Several groups of proteins were fully excluded from SignaLink.
These groups, together with our detailed reasons for excluding
them, are listed in the Supplementary Material. The compilation

of SignaLink was based on published review and research papers.
Note that the curation of the current version of SignaLink was
closed in May 2008. Naturally, more pathways (deﬁned by the same
evolutionary and biochemical rules) and proteins can be added in
a future version. We plan to update SignaLink every July (starting
2011). The next update will include recent high-conﬁdence HTP
data. Overall, based on the comparison we presented in this sub-
section, we expect that the limitations of SignaLink are small
compared to the improvements it can provide.

4.2 Current applications

The primary goal of SignaLink is to provide maps of global pathway
communication in three metazoans (C.e1eg(1ns, D.me1(1nog(1ster
and H.sapiens) with well-documented, uniform manual curation.
Interactions from all healthy tissue types were included into
SignaLink, and expression data from selected tissues were used
for dynamic analysis. We found that the pathways EGF/MAPK,
JAK/STAT and Notch are clear examples for three distinct types
of behavior: (i) high expression in normal tissue types and strong
changes in cancer; (ii) high expression, but small changes; and
(iii) low expression and small changes. See the Supplementary
Material for additional literature support.

Network analyses—combined with system-level resources—
can contribute to modern drug target discovery, e.g. to
polypharmacology and multi-target drug selection (Hopkins, 2008;
Korcsmaros et (11., 2007). With SignaLink, one can prioritize novel
drug target candidates by examining the list of: (i) multi-pathway
proteins and (ii) proteins participating in cancer-related cross-talks.
Some of these proteins could be speciﬁc and proper targets, some of
them could be too central and aspeciﬁc. After listing the properties
of these proteins relevant for drug target selection, we suggested
four novel drug target candidates. One of them, ROR2, was recently
proposed as a novel chemotherapeutic target, while the other three
are known to be non-speciﬁcally affected by anti-inﬂammatory
drugs. A broader list contains 35 additional proteins with a lower
conﬁdence, which may be again ﬁltered with additional criteria, e.g.
phosphatase activity.

Uniformly curated signaling pathways

 

In biomedical experimental work, the functions of a few selected
proteins are often modiﬁed. These changes can unexpectedly perturb
signaling pathways and non-speciﬁcally affect cellular processes.
Based on several data sources, including SignaLink, we have
launched a web server, PathwayLinker, to aid experimental work by
linking the queried proteins to signaling pathways through physical
and/or genetic interactions (Farkas et (11., submitted for publication).

4.3 Future applications

As their name suggests, targeting multi-pathway proteins may not be
selective. However, selectivity is a key property in pharmacology,
thus, analyses of multi-pathway proteins could support drug target
discovery. Based on SignaLink, we suggest single-gene knock-out
experiments or RNA silencing of individual cross-talking proteins to
help understand the functional selectivity of signaling pathways and
to reduce the redundancies that are assumed to make many currently
used drugs less efﬁcient (Tortora et (11., 2004; Urban et (11., 2007).

For the mathematical modeling of the dynamical behavior of
biomolecular pathways the precise, high-coverage reconstruction
of the static network structure of these pathways is crucial (Papin
et (11., 2005). In the case of signaling pathways, the manual curation
of the existing literature can be efﬁcient for assembling large-scale
interaction maps. SignaLink datasets have a simple and uniform
structure and are available in several formats for all eight pathways
and three species at http://SignaLink.org. This allows one to easily
merge SignaLink with stoichiometric and expression data from,
e.g. perturbation analyses (Papin et (11., 2005). The static network
provided by SignaLink can serve as a backbone for both numerical
and differential equation-based models and—due to SignaLink’s
focus on cross-talks—for deciphering the rules of cooperation
between pathways (Borisov et (11., 2009; Wang et (11., 2009). Finally,
perturbation analyses that cannot be carried out with HTP PPI
networks (they list undirected PPIs), may be manageable with
SignaLink, because it contains the directions of interactions.

A central goal of synthetic biology is to engineer cells that
can carry out novel tasks (Bhattacharyya et (11., 2006; Friedland
et (11., 2009). One way to achieve this goal is to rewire signaling
circuits by modifying scaffold proteins and other biomolecules or
by changing feed-back loops. In these studies, detailed high-quality
maps of intracellular signaling are essential, especially the positions
of cross-talks and multi-pathway proteins.

Comparative evolutionary studies usually focus on conserved
and altered mechanisms underlying the observed differences in
body plans. Among metazoans, these differences are largely due
to changes in the complexity of regulation rather than different
gene numbers (Levine and Tjian, 2003; Szathmary et (11., 2001).
Two decisive regulatory networks in this case are transcriptional
control and signaling, in particular, cross-talks. SignaLink was
compiled with uniform curation rules for eight major pathways
in three metazoans that have similar signaling mechanisms but
different morphologies. Therefore, the datasets of SignaLink are
well applicable to studying evolutionary changes.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Contrary to earlier views, signaling pathways are now understood as
interlinked (not linear) routes heavily interlinked by cross-talks. This
major paradigm shift necessitates novel, systems-based approaches,

e.g. new techniques for curation and modeling. Attempting to meet
the novel curation requirements, we have compiled a signaling
pathway resource, SignaLink. It allows the systematic comparison of
pathways and their cross-talks. After ﬁnding that any two of the eight
selected human signaling pathways may cross-talk, we quantiﬁed
the possible activity patterns of these cross-talks in healthy and
cancerous human tissues. Large-scale mapping of pathways and
the activity patterns of their cross-talks revealed multi-pathway and
cancer-related cross-talking proteins that can be relevant for drug
target discovery.

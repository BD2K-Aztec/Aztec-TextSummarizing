ABSTRACT

Motivation: It is now well established that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a
critical role in regulating gene expression in a sequence-specific
manner, and genome-wide efforts are underway to predict known
and novel miRNA targets. However, the integrated miRNA—mRNA
analysis remains a major computational challenge, requiring powerful
informatics systems and bioinformatics expertise.

Results: The objective of this study was to modify our widely recog-
nized Web server for the integrated mRNA—miRNA analysis (MMIA)
and its subsequent deployment on the Amazon cloud (BioVLAB-
MMIA) to be compatible with high-throughput platforms, including
next-generation sequencing (NGS) data (e.g. RNA-seq). We de-
veloped a new version called the BioVLAB-MMIA—NGS, deployed on
both Amazon cloud and on a high-performance publicly available
server called MAHA. By using NGS data and integrating various bio-
informatics tools and databases, BioVLAB-MMIA—NGS offers several
advantages. First, sequencing data is more accurate than array-based
methods for determining miRNA expression levels. Second, potential
novel miRNAs can be detected by using various computational meth-
ods for characterizing miRNAs. Third, because miRNA-mediated gene
regulation is due to hybridization of an miRNA to its target mRNA,
sequencing data can be used to identify many-to-many relationship
between miRNAs and target genes with high accuracy.

1 INTRODUCTION

miRNAs are small (19724 nt) single-stranded non-coding RNAs
that regulate gene expression by speciﬁc targeting mechanism to
mRNA molecules Via complementary sequence pairing. Due to
their critical implication in post-transcriptional regulation and
impact on the developmental process, a number of
(microRNA) miRNAimRNA integrated analysis tools have
been developed. MAGIA (Sales et al., 2010) uses miRNAi
mRNA expression proﬁle matrices as input and provides gene
set analysis and miRNA target prediction. DIANA-mirExTra
(Alexiou et al., 2010) accepts gene sets and computationally com-
pares miRNA-associated motifs. miRGator (Cho et al., 2013)

provides pre-compiled public resources with browser interface
to navigate data. However, several limitations exist for these
and other existing tools, including the following: (i) support
only microarray or sequencing data but not both; (ii) require
preprocessing or manual data compiling step; (iii) demand cum-
bersome installation procedures with interdependent tools and
databases; (iv) run on limited computational resources that are
not capable of handling large datasets. Here we present the
next-generation sequencing (NGS) data-compatible BioVLAB-
MMIA-NGS, an updated version of our array-based miRNAi
mRNA integrated analysis system mRNAimiRNA analysis
(MMIA) (Nam et al., 2009)

2 APPROACH

To perform integrated analyses between miRNA and mRNA
using NGS data, we completely redesigned the MMIA Web
server. BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS uses sequencing data to directly
measure miRNA and mRNA expression levels on a genome
scale and accurately detect changes in quantity based on read
count. The system accepts raw sequencing data as input without
requiring any preprocessing steps. By using RNA-seq and small
RNA-seq data, not only can BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS predict
novel miRNA candidates, it can also extract new information
about miRNA targeting of intragenic regions, exons and introns
as well as 3/ UTRs, which have recently been used in the inte-
grated analysis in plants (Meng et al., 2013). Furthermore, to
completely remove the burden of manually installing additional
analysis tools, BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS adopts Java Web start
(JAWS), a single click JAVA application deployment technol-
ogy. Moreover, to support large NGS data analysis, the prepro-
cessing and computational processes in BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS
moved data to Amazon cloud and peta—scale super computing
system called MAHA (http://www.etri.re.kr/eng/res/res_
06020402.etri).

3 FEATURES

Workﬂow: In BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS, the integrated analysis
workﬂow begins with extracting differentially and (or) signiﬁ-
cantly expressed miRNAs (DEmiR) as in our previous published
methodology (Xin et al., 2009). To identify miRNAs and their
expression level, we adopted the miRDeep (Friedlander et al.,
2011) pipeline. The mapper module of the miRDeep package
aligns raw sequencing reads to known miRNAs in miRBase

Alignment Visualization

Network Analysis

Fig. 1. BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS accepts NGS/microarray data as input and extracts DEGs targeted by DEmiRs. Through the analysis pipelines, the
system produces results of pathway analysis, gene set analysis, novel miRNA prediction, alignment visualization and constructed miRNAimRNA target

network

(Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2010), and the quantiﬁer
module measures expression levels based on read counts.
Quality control and adaptor clipping processes are performed
if necessary. Signiﬁcance of expressed miRNAs is tested and
Visualized by DESeq (Anders and Huber., 2010) based on read
count measures. Differentially expressed mRNAs/ genes (DEG)s
are extracted by using the TophatiCufﬂinks pipeline (Trapnell
et al., 2012) with junction aligning based on the RPKM measure.
Statistical significance is Visualized by cummeRbund (Goff et al.,
2012). For microarray data, DEGs and DEmiRs are detected by
Limma package (Smyth, 2005). Once DEGs and DEmiRs are
extracted, the next step, miRNAimRNA combined analysis, is
performed. For the combined analysis, we used miRNA target
prediction algorithms/databases, TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2005),
PITA (Kertesz et al., 2007), miRSVR (Betel et al., 2010) and
PMTED (Sun et al., 2013), as well as negative correlations be-
tween miRNAs and mRNAs, to extract DEGs targeted by
DEmiRs. Gene set analysis is performed using extracted
DEGs. Gene sets are automatically submitted to DAVID
(Huang et al., 2007) to provide functional annotation and clus-
tering, BioCarta and KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) path-
ways mapping, and disease association. Figure 1 shows
BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS workﬂow.

User interface: BioVLAB—MMIA-NGS keeps the user-friendly
Web-based interface for sample information, analysis options
and parameters, and computing nodes. To provide extended ana-
lysis interface, we integrated IGV (Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013)
for Visualizing the alignment results with zoom in/out function-
ality with annotation tracks and Cytoscape (Shannon et al.,
2003) for illustrating identiﬁed miRNAimRNA target networks.
By using JAWS, IGV and Cytoscape automatically Visualize the
results; manual installation and data handling processes are not
required. A Web page summarizing all the results helps the users
to View and further investigate the data.

System: The information system architecture has also adopted
several important changes. The analysis begins from the Web
interface, and the graphical workﬂow composer shows progress
status. In addition, BioVLAB, the cloud infrastructure used in
our previous system, has been completely rebuilt using Apache
Airavata (http://airavata.apache.org/), generating a highly flex-
ible and extensible three-layered BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS archi-
tecture. Moreover, BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS now supports
human, mouse and rice genomes.

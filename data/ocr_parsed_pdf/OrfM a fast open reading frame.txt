Abstract

Summary: Finding and translating stretches of DNA lacking stop codons is a task common in the
analysis of sequence data. However, the computational tools for finding open reading frames are
sufficiently slow that they are becoming a bottleneck as the volume of sequence data grows. This
computational bottleneck is especially problematic in metagenomics when searching unassembled
reads, or screening assembled contigs for genes of interest. Here, we present OrfM, a tool to rap—
idly identify open reading frames (ORFs) in sequence data by applying the Aho—Corasick algorithm
to find regions uninterrupted by stop codons. Benchmarking revealed that OrfM finds identical
ORFs to similar tools (’GetOrf’ and ’Translate’) but is four—five times faster. While OrfM is sequenc—
ing platform—agnostic, it is best suited to large, high quality datasets such as those produced by
Illumina sequencers.

1 Introduction

In genomics, stretches of DNA uninterrupted by stop codons are
known as open reading frames (ORFs). The TAG (‘amber’), TAA
(‘ochre’) and TGA (‘opal’) stop codons signal the ribosomal machin-
ery to cease translation, with few exceptions. An extended stretch of
DNA free of in-frame stop codons is evidence that a gene may be
encoded on that region.

ORF prediction in metagenomics can be performed on finished
population genomes, draft population genomes, assembled con-
tigs or individual reads. Searching for genes in individual metage-
nomic reads (‘gene-centric analysis’) is useful when reference
genomes are unavailable and assembly of reads is either computa-
tionally prohibitive or a microbial community is too complex for
successful assembly (Howe and Chain, 2015). In long assembled
sequences, conventional gene predictors use information such as
codon usage to more accurately predict genes, but these signals
become unreliable in the limited genomic context of short read
data.

In bacterial and archaeal genomes, genes are not interrupted by
exons and intergenic space is minimal, so short read sequences
derived from these genomes are more likely to encode a fragment of
a gene uninterrupted by a stop codon. ORF prediction directly on
early next generation sequencing platforms (e.g. Roche 454) was dif-
ficult as they produced reads prone to insertion deletion (indel)
errors. In contrast, newer Illumina-based sequencers generate reads
where indel errors are rare; reads are higher quality and the errors
that do occur are chiefly substitution errors (Junemann et (11., 2013).
The current widespread use of Illumina sequencing in metagenomics
(Bragg and Tyson, 2014) presents an opportunity to find ORFs in
microbial reads directly.

Identification of ORFs in short read data simplifies downstream
comparative analysis and allows use of tools that require protein se-
quence as input e.g. searching for protein families with HMMER
(Camacho et (11., 2009). Using ORFs instead of six-frame translating
sequences for downstream sequence comparison tools e.g. BLAST

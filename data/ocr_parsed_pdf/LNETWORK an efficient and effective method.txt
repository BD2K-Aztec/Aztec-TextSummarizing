set V = C and edge set E, such that any two clusters C1, C2 6 C
are connected by an edge if and only if they are incompatible.
For each pair of incompatible clusters, C1, C2 6 C, an incompati—
bility statement is defined by the three terms C1\C2, C1 (1 C2 and
C2\C1.

Let C be a set of clusters on X. Given a subset S of X, the
restriction of C to S, denoted by Cl 5, is the result of removing all
of the elements in X \S from each cluster in C. S with |S| >1 is
called an S T —set (strict tree set) with respect to C if S and any one
cluster C e C are compatible, and CIS is also compatible. An ST—
set S is maximal if there are no other ST—sets containing S except
itself. There is a subtree with respect to a maximal ST—set S,
which is constructed for the cluster set {C IC 6 C, C C S} U S.

An ancestor u of a node v in a network N = (V, E) is called a
stable ancestor if each path from the root to v passes through :4;
otherwise it is called an unstable ancestor. Conversely, v is called a
stable descendant of u if u is a stable ancestor of v, and v is called an
unstable descendant of u if u is an unstable ancestor of v. The
tripartition associated with a tree edge e = (u, v) in N (N is on
X) is 6(e) = (A(e),B(e), C(e)), where A(e) = {x e X|x is a stable
descendant of v}, B(e) = {x e X Ix is an unstable descendant of v}
and C(e) = {x e X|x is not a descendant of v}. Here we use @(N)
to denote all tripartitions in N. The tripartition distance between
two networks N1 and N2 is |®(N1)A®(N2)|/2, where A denotes
the symmetric difference. The tripartition distance is a metric on
the set of all of the rooted phylogenetic networks that have the
tree—child property and are time consistent (Cardona, 2009).

2.1 CASS algorithm

Consider a set of taxa X and a set of clusters C on X. The CASS
algorithm includes several steps to construct a network for C as
follows. First, it ﬁnds all of the non—trivial biconnected compo—
nents C1, - - - , Cp of the incompatibility graph IG(C). For each C,~,
i e {1, - - - , p}, let C; be the result of collapsing all of the maximal
ST—sets for C,~. As it does not know the level number of the network
for C}, it ﬁrst sets k: 0. Then CASS(k) seeks to construct a simple
level 3 k network, i.e. N,-, for C}. If there exists such a network, it
outputs the resulting network and halts; otherwise it lets k = k + l
and continues. This is pivotal for constructing networks. Second,
CASS constructs a unique phylogenetic tree T for the cluster set C”,
which contains the clusters that remain after removing all of the
clusters in C1, - - - , Cp from C, and all of the clusters that consist of
all of the taxa of each C,~, i e {1, - - - , p}, and all of the maximal ST—
sets of C 1, - - - , C1,. Third, it integrates T with all of the simple level
3 k networks, N1, - - - , N p, to obtain the resulting level k network,
using ancestor nodes displacement.

CASS(k) constructs the simple level 3 k network for the non—
trivial biconnected components C; as follows. It loops over all taxa
x. For each choice of x, CASS(k) tries x as the label of the leaf below
the reticulate node, and thus CASS(k) removes it from each cluster.
It subsequently collapses all of the maximal ST—sets of the result—
ing cluster set. CASS(k) repeats this step k times. If, after this pro—
cess, the resulting clusters C0 are compatible, then CASS(k) creates
a network consisting of a phylogenetic tree for C0; otherwise
CASS(k) returns an empty network. Further, CASS(k) ‘expands’,
i.e. it replaces each leaf labeled with a maximal ST—set S with
the subtree of S. Then, CASS(k) adds a new leaf below the new
reticulate node and labels it as the latest removed taxon. As it does

not know where to add the new reticulate node, CASS(k) tries to
add the reticulate node below each pair of edges. These steps are
repeated k times. For the constructed simple level 3 k network,
CASS(k) checks whether it represents all of the input clusters. If it
does, then the algorithm returns the resulting network; otherwise
it returns an empty network.

As we have seen, when constructing the simple level 3 k net—
work for the non—trivial biconnected components C}, CASS first
sets k = 0, then runs CASS(k). If CASS(k) returns a network that is
not an empty network, it halts; otherwise it lets k = k + l and
continues. Assuming that there is a set of clusters represented by
a level 1 network, we can imagine that CASS must run CASS(0),
CASS(l), -- -, CASS(l) until it has constructed the level 1 network.
This results in an excessive consumption time for a high level I.
When running CASS(k), the label of the node below the reticulate
node is uncertain, so each taxon, x e X, must be tried repeatedly
until the network N represents the complete set of clusters. Such
uncertainty also results in constructed networks that are greatly
dependent on the order of input data. However, the following
Theorem 2 shows that there is a network for a given set of clus—
ters, and the network has certain labels below its reticulate nodes.
We use Theorem 2 to develop the LNETWORK algorithm. Our
experiments show LNETWORK is faster than CASS and weakens
the inﬂuence of input data order.

2.2 Seed-growing algorithm

The seed—growing algorithm (Huson et al., 2009) has been used to
solve the Restricted Maximum Compatible Subset (RMCS) prob—
lem for an incompatible cluster set C, i.e. it finds a minimum set of
taxa R C X, such that C | M R is compatible.

Suppose that L is the list of all of the incompatibility state—
ments for C. The algorithm maintains a set of candidate solutions
S, called seeds. A seed s* resolves an incompatibility statement
X, Y,Z, ifXg s* or Yg s* orZ g s*. Each seeds 6 Sis labeled
by the number rank(s) of incompatibility statements that it has
been shown to resolve in succession, starting from the beginning
of the list L. Initially, the three parts of the ﬁrst incompatibility
statement are chosen as three seeds, and we set rank(s): l for
each seed s. The algorithm chooses a seed s* that has a minimum
size among all of the seeds. If rank(s*) = |L|, then s* is an opti—
mal solution and the algorithm halts. Otherwise, if s* resolves the
(rank(s*)+l)—th incompatibility statement X, Y, Z, we increment
rank(s*) by 1; otherwise, we deﬁne three new seeds s1 = s* U X,
sz 2 s* U Y and s3 = s* U Z, with rand(s1)=rand(s2)=
rand(s3) = rand(s*) + l, and then we add these to S and remove
s* from S. The above steps repeat until the algorithm halts.

Let A be a solution found by the seed—growing algorithm.
We then add A to A, where A is a solution set of the RMCS
problem for C. Further, for each seed s e S with |s| = |A|, ifs is
also a solution of the RMCS problem for C, we add s to A. A will
be applied in the context of LNETWORK.

3 DEFINITIONS, LEMMAS AND THE MAIN
THEOREM

The incompatibility degree of a cluster set C, denoted by d(C), is

equal to the number of edges in the incompatibility graph IG(C).

The incompatibility degree of a taxon x e X with respect to C,

 

2271

ﬁm'spzumofpmﬂo'sopeuuopnorq/ﬁdnq

J.Wang et al.

 

denoted by d(x), is d(x) 2 d(C) — d(C|X\{x}). The frequency of a
taxon x e X with respect to C, denoted by f (x), is
f(x) = |{C e Clx e C}|. A cluster C e C is called a minimal clus—
ter if there is no cluster C0 6 C such that COQC. For two clusters,
C1 and C2, we say C1<C2 if Clng. Let C0 be a cluster on X.
We say C<C0 if C<C0 for any cluster C e C.

Given a set of seeds S, for any two seeds, s1,s2 e S, with
|s1| = |s2|, we define the order of s1 and s2 as follows. Let
s1={a1,a2,---,an} and S2 = {b1,b2, ---,b,,}. We say s1>s2 if
d(a,~)>d(b,~), where a,- and b,- are the first pair of taxa with differ—
ent incompatibility degrees, or if for all of ie {1,2, ---,n},
d(a,~) = d(b,~) and f(a,«) >ﬂbj), where a,- and b,- are the first pair
of taxa with different frequencies; otherwise s1 2 s2.

Suppose that the seed—growing algorithm finds that
A = {a1,a2, ---,a,,} is a solution of the RMCS problem for C.
Then, for each element a,—, ie {1,2, ---,n}, let C,~= {CECI
a,~ e C}. Let E = Cl r162 0 ~ ~ ~ 06, and M: (C1\C) U (C2\C)
U - - - U (C,\C), where t g n. We can say that {a1,a2, ---,a,} can
be merged, if M < A, where A can be seen as a cluster.

LEMMA 1. Given three cluster sets C1, C2 and C3 on X and a
cluster CO on X, let M1 =  0C2» U  ﬂC2)),
M2 = (C1\(C1 ﬂ C_3)) U (C3\(C1 f1 C3», M3 = (C2_\(C2 f1 C32)U
(C3\(C2 ﬂ C3», C = C1 ﬂ C2 ﬂ C3 and M =  U 
(C3\C). Then M< C0 ifandonly ifM1< C0, M2 < C0 andM3 < C0.

PROOF. See the Supplementary Material.

From Lemma 1, it follows that B = {a1,a2, ---,a,} can be
merged if and only if any subsets of B can be merged.

We merge elements that can be merged for A such that
A = {Ab/12, “‘,Ak}, Where Ai = {011,012, “warm-L AinAj =
(ll(i;£j), i,j 6 {1,2, ---,k} and 2:1 m, = n. Each A,- is called a
removed taxon with respect to C. A removed taxon A,- is called
trivial if it contains only one element; otherwise it is called non—
trivial. LetC,~ = {C e C|C g A, CﬂA,~ 75 {(1} and i 6 {1,2, ---,k}.
A,- and A,- (i 75 j) are called conﬂicting if there exists a cluster
C e C} U 3/, such that C,A,~ are incompatible, and C, A; are in—
compatible. A ,- is called conﬂicting if the cluster set C| A, is incom—
patible. Then, C”; = {C e C} U le C, A,~ are incompatible, and
C, A; are incompatible} is called the conﬂicting cluster set of A,-
and A,-, whereas C” = {C1, C2 6 CIA, IQ and C2 are incompat—
ible} is called the conﬂicting cluster set of A,-. Obviously, if A,-
and A,- are conﬂicting then A,- or A,- is non—trivial, and if A,- is
conﬂicting then A ,- is non—trivial. A is called decomposable if there
is a conﬂicting removed taxon A,~ e A, or if there are two
removed taxa A,-, A; e A, such that A,- and ,- are conﬂicting;
otherwise it is called indecomposable. Let
A6 = {i e {1, 2, - - - , k}|A,~ is conﬂicting, or there exists a removed
taxon ,« e A, such that A ,- and ,- are conﬂicting}. Let

a: U C},UC}U{A,~}. (3.1)

i,jeAc ieAc ieAc

C/ is obviously incompatible when A is decomposable; hence, the
seed—growing algorithm can ﬁnd a solution A’ = {A1 , A/Z, - - - , A;n}
for C’ after merging the elements that can be merged. We subse—
quently decompose A by means of A/ as follows.

Decomposing: Find all of the removed taxa from A’ that are
subsets of A1. Without loss of generality, let Al and A2 6 A/ be

subsets of A1. Then we decompose A1 into A1, A5, A1\(A’l U A”).
If no such removed taxon exists, we decompose A1 into itself. We

then decompose A2, - - - ,Ak in the same way.
After applying the decomposing process to A, we get
A = {Al/1,    ---,A;;.,.}; for the

sake of brevity, we denote this as A = {A1,A2, ---,Ak}. Then,
if A is still decomposable, we compute C/ using Formula (3.1).
Further, we obtain a solution A” for the RMCS problem for C/
using the seed—growing algorithm, and merge the elements for A”
that can be merged. Subsequently, we decompose A by means of
A” using the decomposing process. We repeat the above steps
until A is indecomposable, at which point we say that A has
undergone decomposing.

Suppose that A = {A”,A/2’, ---,A”} is indecomposable. For
each A”, ie {2, ---,k — 1}, we say that the removed order of
A” is after A”,A/2/, ---,A”Ll and before A”+l, ---,A”.
Specifically, the removed orders of A” and A” are the ﬁrst and
the last, respectively. For each A” with |A”|>1, we need to
decide its removal order using the following sorting process.

Sorting: Let C} = {C e C|C g A and CD A” 75 Ill},
ie {1,2, ---,k}. If there exists a cluster CeCi, such that C
and A” are incompatible, then C1 = C\A”.  should be
before A” if  g C1(i géj). Then we sort A.

After applying the sorting process to A” with |A”| >1,
i6 {1, ---,k}, we get A = {A1,A2, ---,Ak}, which is a permuta—
tion ofA = {A”, A”, - - - , A”}. Then we say that A has undergone
sorting.

THEOREM 2. Let C be a cluster set on X with IG(C) connected and
assume that there are no S T —sets with respect to C.
A = {A1,A2, ---,Ak} is a solution of the RMCS problem for C,
which has undergone decomposing and sorting. Then there will be a
network N, with rN = k representing C, and the leaves below the
reticulate nodes ofN will be A1,A2, - - - ,Ak, respectively.

PROOF. See the Supplementary Material.

Theorem 2 tells us that there is a network representing the
given cluster set and the leaves below the reticulate nodes are
the removed taxa. However, because of the method of inserting
the new nodes that have a child that is a reticulate node, the
network N constructed by the proof of Theorem 2 represents
too many redundant clusters. Therefore, when inserting those
nodes, the LNETWORK(k) algorithm follows the CASS(k) algo—
rithm, i.e. it tries to add the nodes below each pair of edges.

4 LNEI'WORK

LNETWORK f1rst decomposes the incompatibility graph IG(C) into
biconnected components, as does CASS, and then constructs a
simple level 3 k network by applying LNETWORK(k) to each
non—trivial biconnected component separately. Then it integrates
those simple level 3 k networks into a ﬁnal network. The process
with which LNETWORK(k) constructs a simple level 3 k network is
as follows.

Let A be the solution set of the RMCS problem for C found
by the seed—growing algorithm. Then, LNETWORK(k) chooses a
solution A from A such that A 3 B for any element B e A.
This step aims at weakening the inﬂuence of input data order
by fixing the solution of the RMCS problem for C when the input

order of C is changed. The decomposing process is then applied
repeatedly until A is indecomposable. Subsequently, the sorting
process is applied. Then A = {A1,A2, ---,Ak}.

LNETWORK(k) ﬂrst removes A1 from each cluster of C. It sub—
sequently collapses all of the maximal ST—sets of CIA/1]. These
steps repeat k times until the resulting cluster set is compatible
and the second phase of the algorithm starts. LNETWORK(k) cre—
ates a network consisting of a unique phylogenetic tree for the
resulting cluster set. Then the algorithm ‘expands’. Subsequently,
LNETWORK(k) adds a new leaf below the new reticulate node and
labels it as the removed taxon of this step. Then LNETWORK(k)
tries to add the reticulate node below each pair of edges. The
algorithm continues with a new ‘expand’ step and then hangs the
next leaf below a reticulate node. LNETWORK(k) will save this net—
work if it represents the cluster set of this step. LNETWORK(k)
ﬁnds all of the networks representing the cluster set of this step
and sorts them in descending order of the number of clusters
represented; this reduces the number of redundant clusters in
the resulting network and weakens the inﬂuence of input data
order. These steps are repeated until all of the removed taxa are
appended to the networks. LNETWORK outputs the resulting net—
work, which now has the minimal number of redundant clusters.
The resulting network is a simple level 3 k network, where k is
no less than the number of removed taxa. In particular, when the
resulting network is binary, k equals the number of removed
taxa. For ease of description, sometimes the construction tech—
nique mentioned in this paragraph is called as the remove—col—
lapse—expand—attach technique of LNETWORK.

LNETWORK(k) adds a new dummy taxon to the network when
it constructs the reticulate nodes with indegree >2. The dummy
taxon is removed before it outputs the resulting network. We
give the pseudo—code of the LNETWORK(k) algorithm in the
Supplementary Material.

LEMMA 3. LNETWORK(k) runs in time 0(m2d3m + (k2 + |X|2)2k),
where d is the incompatibility degree of the cluster set C and m is
the size of the solution of the RM CS problem for C.

PROOF. See the Supplementary Material.

In the Supplementary Material, there is an example illustrating
all of the steps of LNETWORK(k) as it constructs a simple level 3 k
network.

5 RESULTS

All of the experiments were performed on a computer with an
Intel Xeon E5504 2.0 GHz CPU, 8GB RAM and 147GB HDD.
The operating system was Debian 4.1 32bit with Java 1.6 in—
stalled. LNETWORK was written in Java.

We tested LNETWORK with both the practical (i.e. real biolo—
gical data) and artificial data (https : / /sites .google.
com/site/cassalgorithm/data—sets) used by CASS
and compared the results of LNETWORK with those of other pro—
grams. The results are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3. The
experiments test two main aspects of the LNETWORK algorithm.
First, they test the inﬂuence of input data order; the results are
shown in Table 1. Second, they test the complexities of the net—
work, i.e. the level, the reticulation number and the redundant
cluster number; the results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

Note: I, k, r and (3 represent, respectively, the running time, the level, the reticulation
number and the redundant cluster number.

To test the inﬂuence of the input data order, for each dataset
the program constructs the networks for every permutation of
input data order. The running time for this process is factorial;
thus, in the experiment the scale of data considered is small. To
compare the differences between the constructed networks, we use
the tripartition distances of networks. Table 1 shows, for each
dataset, the number (n) of the different networks constructed by
each program and the mean, the minimum (min) and the

maximum (max) of tripartition distances of those networks; the
last row gives their average values. Our conclusions about the
superiority of LNETWORK are based on the following observations.
First, the number of different networks constructed by LNETWORK
is less than the number of different networks constructed by CASS
for the same data with different input orders. Second, the tripar—
tition distance between the networks constructed by LNETWORK is
less than that between the networks constructed by CASS; this
demonstrates that, if LNETWORK outputs more than one network
when the input order of the data is changed, the networks con—
structed by LNETWORK are more similar to each other than the
networks constructed by CASS. Thus, LNETWORK effectively weak—
ens the inﬂuence of input data order compared with CASS.

Table 2 compares the results of LNETWORK with the results of
CASS for several artiﬁcial datasets. Table 2 shows the level k, the
reticulation number r, the redundant cluster number c and the
running time t in hours (h), minutes (In) and seconds (s) for the
two algorithms; the last row gives their average values. The com—
parison shows that LNETWORK takes less time than CASS, and that
the level and the reticulation numbers of the networks con—
structed by LNETWORK are the same as the level and the reticu—
lation numbers of the networks constructed by CASS in almost
every case. Furthermore, the networks constructed by LNETWORK
have fewer redundant clusters than the networks constructed by
CASS in almost every case.

The study by van Iersel et al. compared HYBRID INTERLEVE
(Collins et al., 2011) and Parsimonious Inference of Reticulate
Network (PIRN) (Wu, 2010) with CASS. In this study, we compare
LNETWORK with CASS, the galled network (Huson et al., 2009)
and the cluster network (Huson and Rupp, 2008) using practical
data. Table 3 shows that the average reticulation number of
LNETWORK is slightly more than that of CASS and less than that
of the other two programs. The networks constructed by
LNETWORK represent fewer redundant clusters than those

the cluster network produced a level-31 network with 31 reticulations and
>5239 redundant clusters

constructed by the other programs. In terms of running time,
LNETWORK is faster than CASS in general, but is slower than the
cluster network and the galled network algorithms. Even so, the
running time of LNETWORK is acceptable. Thus LNETWORK is su—
perior to the other algorithms when we consider running time,
number of reticulations and number of redundant clusters.
Tables 2 and 3 show that when the constructed networks are
binary, the level and the reticulation number of the network
constructed by LNETWORK are the same as the level and the re—
ticulation number of the network constructed by CASS when the
same input data are used.

We ran LNETWORK and CASS on the simulation data randomly
generated by the PHYL—O—GEN tool (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.
uk/software/phylogen/). Table 4 shows the results of only
LNETWORK as CASS did not ﬁnish within 10 days. These results
suggest that LNETWORK can construct networks for datasets that

need high levels and many reticulations. This conclusion is illu—
strated in Figure 2, which shows the output of LNETWORK when it
is given real data consisting of all of the clusters in at least one of
the four gene trees from a Pinaceae dataset.

Finally, we compare the performance of LNETWORK, CASS, the
galled network and the cluster network using simulation data
generated by the Recodon tool (Arenas and Posada, 2007)
(http: / /darwin.uvigo .es/). We use the tool to randomly
generate 700 datasets, and then run these datasets using each
program. This tests how well the LNETWORK algorithm constructs
networks for input tree sets by comparing the topology structure
of the input trees with the trees represented by the resulting con—
structed network. We first list the trees represented by the con—
structed network. Let T be the input tree set and N be the set of
trees represented by the constructed network for the input tree
set. We then compute the RobinsoniFoulds (RF) distance
(Robinson and Foulds, 1981) between any one tree in N and
any one tree in T. For any two trees T1 and T 2, the RF distance
between them is denoted as RF(T1, T 2). Two trees are identical if
the RF distance between them is zero. The false positive (FP)
is the fraction of trees in N that do not exist in T. The false
negative (FN) is the fraction of trees in T that do not exist in
N. For any one tree T in N, the degree of false positive (DFP)
of T, denoted by DFP(I), is deﬁned as DFP(T)=
min{RF(T, T0)|T0 e T}. For any one tree T in T, the degree
of false negative (DFN) of T, denoted by DFN(T), is defined
as DFN(T) =min{RF(T, T0)| T0 6 N}. For each of the 700 data—
sets, we compute the size of N (SIZE), FP, FN, mean DFP
(MDFP) and mean DFN (MDFN). Table 5 shows the average
of those values. The mean size of the input tree sets is 2.3652. The
table shows that the mean size of trees represented by the net—
works constructed by LNETWORK is closer to the mean size of
input tree sets than the mean size of trees represented by the
networks constructed by the other programs, and the mean
FP, the mean FN, the mean MDFP and the mean MDFN of
the networks constructed by LNETWORK are less than those of the
networks constructed by the other programs. Thus, the networks
constructed by LNETWORK are closer to the input tree sets than
the networks constructed by the other programs.

6 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented LNETWORK, which can construct a phylogen—
etic network for a given set of clusters. We have shown that
LNETWORK effectively weakens the inﬂuence of input data order
compared with CASS, and that the execution time of LNETWORK is
shorter than that of CASS. Moreover, we show that the levels and

the reticulation numbers of networks constructed by LNETWORK
are the same as those of networks constructed by CASS for most
datasets, and that the networks constructed by LNETWORK repre—
sent fewer redundant clusters than other available methods, for
most datasets. We also show that the trees represented by the
networks constructed by LNETWORK are closer to the input trees
than those represented by the networks constructed by all other
tested programs.

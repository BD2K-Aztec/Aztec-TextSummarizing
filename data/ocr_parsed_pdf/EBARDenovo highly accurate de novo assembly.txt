ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-accuracy de novo assembly of the short sequencing
reads from RNA-Seq technology is very challenging. We introduce a
de novo assembly algorithm, EBARDenovo, which stands for
Extension, Bridging And Repeat-sensing Denovo. This algorithm
uses an efficient chimera-detection function to abrogate the effect of
aberrant chimeric reads in RNA-Seq data.

Results: EBARDenovo resolves the complications of RNA-Seq as-
sembly arising from sequencing errors, repetitive sequences and ab-
errant chimeric amplicons. In a series of assembly experiments, our
algorithm is the most accurate among the examined programs, includ-
ing de Bruijn graph assemblers, Trinity and Oases.

Availability and implementation: EBARDenovo is available at http://
ebardenovo.sourceforge.net/. This software package (with patent
pending) is free of charge for academic use only.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA-Seq technology has revolutionized transcriptomic studies in
recent years. In comparison with microarrays, this high-
throughput sequencing technology allows the detection of novel
transcripts. It also has a wider dynamic range in detecting tran-
script abundance than tiling arrays (Agarwal et al., 2010; Kampa
et al., 2004), serial analysis of gene expression (Burke et al., 1999;
Velculescu et al., 1995) and cap analysis of gene expression
(Shiraki et al., 2003). RNA-Seq is especially important for study-
ing organisms without reference genomes. With reference

genomes, accurate reads can be identiﬁed and mapped to the ref-
erence for accurate and sensitive quantiﬁcation of even lowly ex-
pressed transcripts. However, for organisms without reference
genomes, the short reads from RNA-Seq have to be assembled
into contigs representing the transcripts before the expression level
can be determined from the read coverage. In this case, sequencing
errors may cause mis-assembly, create artiﬁcial contigs and con-
sequently produce inaccurate interpretation of transcript abun-
dance (Garcia et al., 2012).

De novo assembly of short reads faces computational chal-
lenges from classical sequencing problems such as sequence re-
peats, homologous genes and artiﬁcial chimeric reads (Fig. 1)
(Kircher et al., 2011). Most de novo RNA-Seq assemblers, includ-
ing Trans-Abyss (Robertson et al., 2010), Oases (Schulz et al.,
2012) and Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011), are de Bruijn graphi
based methods. In de Bruijn graphs, reads are either represented
as k-mer nodes or as k—mer edges, and Eulerian paths between
end nodes are examined for assembling sequences (Pevzner et al.,
2001). Both sequence repeats and artiﬁcial chimeric reads
will cause erroneous k-mer nodes. Most of de Bruijn genome
assemblers, such as Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) and
ALLPATHS (Butler et al., 2008), filter out low-frequency
k-mer nodes to improve accuracy, as low-frequency k—mer
nodes are more likely to be sequencing artifacts. However, de
novo assembly of RNA-Seq data is more difﬁcult because the
abundance of RNA transcripts varies signiﬁcantly (Grabherr
et al., 2011). Although de Bruijnibased algorithms have been
successfully used to construct many transcriptomes using
RNA-Seq data, it has always been difficult to keep the assembly
both accurate and sensitive. Low-frequency k—mer nodes are im-
portant for discovering low-abundance transcripts. For sensitive
detection of novel transcripts, RNA-Seq assemblers usually do
not eliminate low-frequency k-mer nodes. Unfortunately, retain-
ing low-frequency k—mer nodes would reduce assembly accuracy.

In this study, we introduce an efficient algorithm for RNA-Seq
assembly, with special emphasize on detecting chimeric reads and

A aberrant chlmerlc read



erroneous merge of reads

Fig. 1. The two major sources of errors in RNA-Seq de novo assembly.
(a) The presence of common sub-sequences (repetitive sequences, hom-
ologous sequences) among transcripts causes reads to merge by mistake
and produce mis-assembly (i). By using paired-end reads, the opportunity
for mis-assembly is reduced. (b) Aberrant chimeric amplicons composed
of disjointed regions of one or more transcripts can cause erroneous as-
sembly of reads into artiﬁcial contigs

assembly errors. We showed that our new de novo assembly al-
gorithm, designated EBARDenovo, has enhanced accuracy,
while it still maintains high sensitivity in determining transcript
abundance.

2 METHODS

2.1 Key principles of EBARDenovo

The new algorithm, EBARDenovo, which stands for Extension,
Bridging And Repeat-sensing Denovo, applies a bi-directional
expansion method using paired-end RNA-Seq data to guide
the transcriptome assembly (Fig. 2a).

In this algorithm, the construction of a contig begins with a
seed read. Searches are done to ﬁnd proper neighboring reads at
both ends of the seed. Two reads that come from the same
paired-end sequencing reads are defined as read mates of each
other. To avoid potentially ambiguous assembly created by
repeat sequences, a proper extension must satisfy one of two
conditions (Fig. 2b): i) a read mate can be found inside the
contig that is currently being constructed; or ii) a read mate
can be found in a neighboring (usually overlapping) contig. To
ensure both conditions are satisﬁed for a contig extension, a
chimera-detection test is performed on the paired candidates
(Fig. 2c). Assuming there is a chimeric read RC composed of
two fragments from transcripts TA and TB, the correct assembly
should always have higher read coverage than the contig con-
taining the chimeric reads. In this case, the backtracking from the
other end of chimeric read RC will ﬁnd a set of correct reads from
transcript TB, and the alignment of these reads is compared with
the nucleotide bases of the current contig to determine whether
the program can correctly expand the contig or cause a trans-
location of the two segments.

2.1 EBARDenovo: the proposed algorithm and key
operations

EBARDenovo algorithm consists of three key operations: exten-
sion, bridging and repeat sensing. These operations are applied

Fig. 2. The key principles in EBARDenovo for achieving high accuracy.
(21) The outline of EBARDenovo algorithm. Candidate reads are itera-
tively added at both ends with three operations: extension, bridging and
repeat sensing. (b) The two conditions for the alignment of an adjacent
pair of reads (Ra and Rb) or (La and Lb). (i) the paired mate (Lb or Ra) is
inside the current contig. (ii) The paired mate (Rb) is found in neighboring
(usually overlapping) contigs. (c) Dynamic chimera detection. The
aligned reads from the backtracking process are compared with the con-
sensus sequence (TA) to detect potential chimeric junctions

to both the right-end and the left-end expansions such that the
selected sub-optimal reads are added in these operations.

Before starting the three assembly operations, EBARDenovo
deﬁnes the first few base pairs (the default is 15 bp) of each read
as its indexing keys. The reads are also sorted according to their
abundance, and the most abundant read is selected as the first
seed for the extension, followed by the second most abundant
reads and so on.

To start the extension operation of assembly, the 2nd to the
nth bp (the default is from 2nd to 16th bp corresponding to a 15-
mer) will be used as the query key to search against the indexing
keys of a11 reads. If no matching key is found, a query key will be
generated from the 3rd to the 17th bp and so on. If a matching
key is found, the reads containing this key will be aligned to the
seed read at the error detection area (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Error detection area is the overlapping region between the seed
and the matching read, but excluding the key index region. At
this step, all perfectly matched reads will be merged to extend the
seed to a longer contig. If no perfect candidate is available, the
reads with fewest mismatches will be used. However, >10% mis-
match in the error detection area is not tolerated.

In the bridging operation, EBARDenovo uses paired-end in-
formation to constrain the search space. By using ‘foreseeable
reads’ to conﬁrm correct assembly, reads with as small as 15 bp
overlaps can be constructed into reliable contigs. A read is ‘fore-
seeable’ if one of its paired-end sequenced mates is already in the
contig (Fig. 3a). If a foreseeable read is already aligned in the
contig, the extension of an assembled contig is continued
(Fig. 3a). The extension at this stage is only one-way, either
left to right or right to left. This is because bi—directional exten-
sion of a chimeric seed read would probably generate a chimeric
contig, and there is insufﬁcient information to detect chimeric
reads at this stage. In the case that the foreseeable read is not

Contig splitting

Fig. 3. The key steps of EBARDenovo. (a) ‘Read foreseeing’ tracks the paired mates of the aligned reads, which have not been aligned in the contig.
These unaligned reads can be merged into the contig in upcoming operations of extension, bridging or repeat sensing. (b) In the extension operation,
candidate reads are selected from the read pool according to a short indexing key. (c) In the bridging operation, foreseeable reads may match the
expanding end of a contig. (d) In the repeat-sensing operation, if there are possible expansions for a contig, it is backtracked along each expanding
possibility. The contig will be split if there are more than two possible expansions. (e) In the extension operation, when a non-foreseeable read is met,
EBARDenovo attempts to align reads from the mate of the non-foreseeable read in the opposite direction of the extension

within the temporary contig, the foreseeable read will be used as
seed read and extended backward to see whether the extension
can reach the temporary contig (Fig. 2b). The insert sizes of
paired-end RNA-Seq can be very different even within the
same dataset. To avoid the assembly quality being affected by
the varying insert sizes, the insert sizes are not evaluated in
EBARDenovo.

The repeat-sensing operation also uses foreseeable reads to
identify repetitive sequences naturally occurring in transcripts
and resolve the issue of multiple expansions (Fig. 3b). A contig
is split when multiple expansions occur, and the extension oper-
ation is then executed if there are no other foreseeable reads to
indicate possible bridging (Fig. 3c). If the extension operation
fails owing to sequencing errors, the algorithm will go back to

the bridging operation (Fig. 3d). The extension and bridging
operations are alternated until the contigs are no longer extend-
able. At the end, all the aligned reads are paired. The entire
procedure of EBARDenovo is illustrated in Figure 4.

2.3 The veriﬁcation of assembly accuracy using GMAP

The accuracy of assemblers was verified using GMAP (Wu and
Watanabe, 2005) program. GMAP aligns the contigs with a ref-
erence genome to check the correctness of contigs. The
Arabidopsis thaliana genome was downloaded from the TAIR
database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). The Mus musculus
(mouse) and Homo sapiens (human) genomes were downloaded
from the UCSC Genome database (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.
edu). GMAP classiﬁes mapping results into four classes: unique
mapping (U), multiple mapping (M), translocated mapping (T)
and no mapping (N). The no-mapping results were seen as con-
tamination of the RNA samples. The error rates of assembly
results were estimated by the ratio of translocated mappings T/
(U + M + T). The RPKM values for genes were computed with
the software CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1 by mapping the
sequencing reads to the transcriptome databases. RPKM is
defined as (MortazaVi et al., 2008)

the total number of reads

 

the number of mapped reads x gene length x 109

2.4 Output of EBARDenovo for transcriptome analysis

To easily examine the assembly results, detect potential single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and calculate expression
levels of assembled contigs, EBARDenovo offers four types of
output information for each reconstructed sequence, including (i)
the sequences, (ii) the aligned reads in each contig, (iii) the align-
ment of used pairs and (iv) the plot of sequence coverage

(Supplementary Fig. S1). EBARDenovo also outputs the general
information of contigs, the SNPs and the locations of small over-
laps among reads in the same contig. The users can Visualize the
variants of the transcripts. In the past, users relied on supple-
mental mapping tools, e. g. Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009), to
map reads to a contig and to estimate the abundance, whereas
EBARDenovo alone can produce sufﬁcient information for
advanced analyses such as the identiﬁcation of RNA editing
sites (Brennicke et al., 1999) and gene fusion candidates (Vega
and Medeiros, 2003). We expect that EBARDenovo can enhance
the experience of RNA-Seq analysis.

2.5 Software implementation

EBARDenovo is implemented in C# with the .NET Framework.
The executable program can be run on 64 bit operating systems
such as Windows, Linux and Mac OS. On Linux or Mac OS,
Mono framework (http://www.mono-project.com/) needs to be
installed to run the program. EBARDenovo program and the
user manual can be downloaded from http://ebardenovo.source-
forge.net/. It is also available as Supplementary Software.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 RNA-Seq datasets and tested de novo assembly
algorithms

We tested our algorithm against two de Bruijn graphibased as-
semblers, Trinity and Oases, using six RNA-Seq datasets (listed
in Table 1) from three model organisms: A.thaliana, M .musculus
(mouse) and H.sapiens (human). We used four sizes of k-mers
(21, 25, 29 and 33 bp) to run the Oases assembly. The assemblies
with k—mers of 29 and 33 bp were used to produce the merging
results known as Oases-M assemblies. Trinity only provides a

fixed size of k—mer (25 bp). By default, EBARDenovo directly
searches for candidate reads by an indexing key (15 bp). The
detail assembly results are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
The assembly results were veriﬁed with the transcriptome and
genome databases TAIR (Rhee et al., 2003) (for A.thaliana) and
NCBI Reference Sequences (RefSeq) (for mouse and human)
using the mapping tool on CLC Genomics Workbench and
GMAP (Wu and Watanabe, 2005). We showed the comparison
of mapped transcripts by different algorithms in Supplementary
Figure S2. Moreover, we checked the intersection of map-
ped transcripts between different assemblies in Supplementary

Highly accurate de nova assembly of RNA-Seq

 

Figure S3. It is obvious that many transcripts can be successfully
reconstructed by only one assembler in each dataset.

3.2 EBARDenovo produced most accurate assemblies for
RNA-Seq datasets

To calculate accuracy of different assembly results, we mapped
assembled contigs to their reference genomes using GMAP pro-
grams to detect translocation caused by potential mis-assembly.
If a contig is mapped to different gene models in a chromosome
or even different chromosomes, it is counted as an artificial
translocation event. If a correct assembly of a natural gene
fusion occurs, it will also be counted as a translocation event
in the GMAP test. However, we assumed such natural fusion
genes to be rare. We also recorded events of a whole contig
mapped to multiple locations of the reference genome (multiple
mapping) but did not count them as translocation errors because
such events were detected even when reference transcripts were
used in our GMAP test. It is obvious that EBARDenovo gener-
ated the least number of translocations among three programs in
all the six experiments (Fig. 5). In the A.thaliana datasets, the
number of erroneous contigs by EBARDenovo is less than
one-ﬁfth of those by Trinity. In the mouse and human datasets,
Trinity produces two to three times more erroneous contigs than
EBARDenovo. The assembly results by Oases with a smaller
k-mer (21 bp) produced more translocation than with a bigger
k-mer (25 bp). The merging assembly by Oases will accumulate
errors from the assemblies with different k—mers. The detail re-
sults of GMAP test are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

The high accuracy of the proposed algorithm implies more
stringent trimming of inaccurate contigs, which results in the
reduction of contig length. For this reason, we checked the cor-
rectness of contigs at comparable lengths. We divided the contigs
by their lengths into three groups (600~799, 800~999 and
1000~1199 bp). We evaluated the accuracy of each contig
group for the three assemblers using the GMAP. Supplementary
Table S3 shows the results. In all the contig groups for all six
datasets, EBARDenovo always produces the most accurate
results.

3.3 The comparison of assembly coverage at different
expression levels by different assemblers

To evaluate the performance of different assemblers on the re-
construction of full-length transcripts, EBARDenovo and the
other two assemblers were compared using three RNA-Seq data-
sets: SRX112186 (A.thaliana), SRX118647 (mouse) and
SRX135562 (human). The expression quantiles were calculated
using the RNA-Seq Analysis tool in the CLC package. The com-
pletion of transcript reconstruction was estimated by comparing
contigs with reference cDNA sequences from TAIR (Rhee et al.,
2003) and RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2012). Transcripts with higher
coverage generally can be reconstructed much closer to full
length, by merging contigs generated from different k-mers,
Oases-M, therefore, produced a more completed reconstruction
than other tools (Fig. 6), but paid a high price in accuracy
(Fig. 5). Artificial translocations generated by Oases-M were
much greater than those generated by the programs using only
a fixed k—mer. In addition, performance of Oases clearly dropped

“The results were from the assemblies of the A.thaliana test data (in Table 1).

of the Inchworm stage usually consumes more memory (10~100 G) for good per—
formance.

i7—3820 PC with 32G RAM. Trinity and Oases were run on Ubuntu 10.04, and
EBARDenvo was run on Windows 7. Both virtual machines are equipped with
same memory space (24 G) and same CPU cores (2:2).

for highly expressed transcripts. In contrast, EBARDenovo gave
the best performance on transcripts with high expression.

4 CONCLUSIONS

EBARDenovo is designed for accurate assembly of paired-end
RNA-Seq data. It consumes less memory space than Trinity and
Oases, whereas its speed is between that of Trinity and Oases
(Table 2). More importantly, in our experiments, the contigs
produced by EBARDenovo have much higher accuracy than
those by both Trinity and Oases. The detection of aberrant chi-
meric reads is the key factor for high accuracy of EBARDenovo.

Accurately generating full-length transcripts and low-
expression transcripts are important goals for the assembly of
RNA-Seq data. There are chimeric transcripts created by natural
gene fusion or sequence recombination. Methods such as
EricScript have been developed to identify these naturally occur-
ring chimeric sequences (Benelli et al., 2012). Nonetheless, there
are also aberrant chimeric reads, which are artifacts from sequen-
cing processes. Chimeric read detection methods, such as
ChimeraScan (Iyer et al., 2011) and UCHIME (Edgar et al.,
2011), require reference genomes and are therefore not applicable
in de novo assembly. The de Bruijn graph assemblers, such as
Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008), do not use active
chimera-detection functions, but instead, remove low-coverage
reads (occurrence 52) as potential aberrant chimeras. This rule
makes the Velvet algorithm less suitable for RNA-Seq data, as
the abundance of transcripts vary greatly. The other de Bruijn
graph assemblers, such Oases and Trinity, relax the rule of elim-
inating low-coverage contigs to allow the assembly of rare reads
(occurrence: 1) (Jiang et al., 2011). However, the preservation
of potential aberrant chimeric reads may produce artiﬁcial trans-
locations of transcripts in the ﬁnal assembly.

In the past years, de Bruijn graph methods had showed its
advantage for full-length assemblies, but chimeric k—mer nodes
limited the capability of modern de Bruijn graph algorithms
to generate accurate low-coverage assemblies. Moreover,
using shorter k—mer in de Bruijn graph assembler algorithms
produces more mis-assemblies (Schulz et al., 2012), whereas
EBARDenovo can maintain high accuracy of assembly even

with a short key length (Supplementary Fig. S5). In conclusion,
the EBARDenovo algorithm is a promising new approach to
identify transcripts from RNA-Seq analysis.

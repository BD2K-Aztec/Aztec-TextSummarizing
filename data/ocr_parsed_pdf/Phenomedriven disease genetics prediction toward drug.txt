Abstract

Motivation: Discerning genetic contributions to diseases not only enhances our understanding of
disease mechanisms, but also leads to translational opportunities for drug discovery. Recent
computational approaches incorporate disease phenotypic similarities to improve the prediction
power of disease gene discovery. However, most current studies used only one data source of
human disease phenotype. We present an innovative and generic strategy for combining multiple
different data sources of human disease phenotype and predicting disease—associated genes from
integrated phenotypic and genomic data.

Results: To demonstrate our approach, we explored a new phenotype database from biomedical
ontologies and constructed Disease Manifestation Network (DMN). We combined DMN with
mimMiner, which was a widely used phenotype database in disease gene prediction studies. Our
approach achieved significantly improved performance over a baseline method, which used only
one phenotype data source. In the leave—one—out cross—validation and de novo gene prediction ana—
lysis, our approach achieved the area under the curves of 90.7% and 90.3%, which are significantly
higher than 84.2% (P<e’4) and 81.3% (P<e’12) for the baseline approach. We further demon—
strated that our predicted genes have the translational potential in drug discovery. We used
Crohn’s disease as an example and ranked the candidate drugs based on the rank of drug targets.
Our gene prediction approach prioritized druggable genes that are likely to be associated with
Crohn’s disease pathogenesis, and our rank of candidate drugs successfully prioritized the Food
and Drug Administration—approved drugs for Crohn’s disease. We also found literature evidence to
support a number of drugs among the top 200 candidates. In summary, we demonstrated that a
novel strategy combining unique disease phenotype data with system approaches can lead to
rapid drug discovery.

1 Introduction

OXFORD

 

Identifying the genetic basis for human diseases plays an important
role in elucidating disease mechanisms and discovering targets of drug
treatments (Hurle et (11., 2013; Plenge et (11., 2013). For computational
strategies to predict disease—associated genes, integrating new data
may lead to new discoveries (Barabasi et (11., 2011; Piro and
Di Cunto, 2012; Tiffin et (11., 2009; Tranchevent et (11., 2011; Wang
et (11., 2011). Traditional approaches exploited genomic data and pri—
oritized genes for a disease if the genes are functionally similar to the

known disease genes (Aerts et (11., 2006; Franke et (11., 2006; Kohler
et (11., 2008; Xu and Li, 2006). Recent studies incorporated clinical
phenotype data to increase the ability of identifying new disease—
associated genes (Hwang et (11., 2012; Lage et (11., 2007; Li and Patra,
2010; Vanunu et (11., 2010; Wu et (11., 2008, 2009), assuming that
similar disease phenotypes reﬂect overlapping genetic causes (Brunner
and Van Driel, 2004; Houle et (11., 2010; Oti et (11., 2008, 2009).
However, most current disease gene prediction approaches

Vanunu et (11., 2010; Wu et (11., 2008, 2009) used only one single
data source of human disease phenotypes. Phenotypic similarity
databases were usually obtained by extracting phenotype knowledge
from texts, such as biomedical literature (Korbel et (11., 2005) and
the phenotype descriptions in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) (Lage et (11., 2007; Robinson et (11., 2008; Van Driel et (11.,
2006). Among them, mimMiner (Van Driel et (11., 2006) and human
phenotype ontology (Robinson et (11., 2008) are based on OMIM
and have been widely used in disease gene prediction studies
(Hoehndorf et (11., 2011; Hwang et (11., 2012; Li and Patra, 2010;
Natarajan and Dhillon, 2014; Vanunu et (11., 2010). Recently, we
explored a different database containing phenotypic knowledge—
the semantic network in Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS)—and constructed a new phenotype network called Disease
Manifestation Network (DMN) (Chen et (11., 2015). We demon—
strated that DMN not only reﬂects genetic relationships among dis—
eases, but also contains different knowledge compared with the
existing database (Chen et (11., 2015). We hypothesize that integrat—
ing this new phenotype network with the widely used disease pheno—
type data will improve the prediction of disease genetics.

In this study, we developed a novel and generic approach to
combine multiple different data sources on human disease pheno—
type, and predict disease—associated genes from seamlessly integrated
phenotypic and genomic data. To demonstrate the approach, we
integrated DMN, mimMiner, a protein interaction network and
known disease—gene associations. We predicted new disease—associ—
ated genes from the heterogeneous network, and demonstrated the
benefit of incorporating an additional phenotype network DMN by
comparing with a baseline approach, which is also based on net—
work analysis but only used mimMiner.

We demonstrated that the disease—gene associations predicted by
our approach, in combination with the drug target data, may guide
the discovery of new candidate drugs. We used Crohn’s disease as
an example, which has increasing worldwide prevalence
(Molodecky et (11., 2012) and is currently incurable (Atreya et (11.,
2014; Cosnes et (11., 2011). We predicted candidate genes for
Crohn’s disease, and prioritized candidate drugs based on the rank
of drug target genes. We validated the result with the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)—approved therapies for Crohn’s disease.
Our result provides empirical evidence that our disease genetics pre—
diction strategy, which combined unique data and a novel system
approach, can lead to rapid drug discovery.

2 Methods

We integrated DMN, mimMiner and a genetic network based on
protein—protein interactions (PPIs), and constructed a heterogeneous
network in Figure 1. Given a disease, we prioritized the genes using
a ranking algorithm extended from the random walk model. We
validated our approach using well—studied disease—gene associations
from OMIM and compared the performance with a baseline disease
gene prediction method that used only one phenotype network. We
also evaluated our approach in predicting genes for diseases of dif—
ferent classes. Finally, we identified candidate drug therapies for
Crohn’s disease based on gene prediction results, and demonstrated
the translational potential of our newly predicted genes.

2.1 Integrate networks

We first constructed the DMN, mimMiner and the PPI network. To
construct DMN, we extracted 50 543 disease—manifestation pairs

from UMLS and calculated pairwise disease similarities based on
disease manifestations (Chen et (11., 2015). Then we downloaded
mimMiner (Van Driel et (11., 2006) and built the PPI network using
37039 binary interactions among 9465 genes in the Human Protein
Reference Database, which has high coverage and accuracy
(Karin, 2010; Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012; Prasad et (11., 2009)
and has been used in many disease gene discovery studies (Kohler
et (11., 2008; Li and Patra, 2010; Vanunu et (11., 2010; Wu et (11.,
2008, 2009).

We connected the three networks as shown in Figure1. We
linked the disease nodes with the same semantic meanings in DMN
and mimMiner using 1313 pairwise mappings between UMLS and
OMIM identifiers from the UMLS Metathesaurus. We also con—
nected 1188 disease nodes in DMN and 1542 in mimMiner to the
gene nodes in the PPI network based on the disease—gene associ—
ations in OMIM. Note that our approach can easily incorporate
more phenotypic or genetic networks in the same way, given that
the new networks contain different knowledge from the existing
ones.

The adjacency matrix of the heterogeneous network is given as
follows:

AG AGP1 AGP2
A 2 A5,] AP, Amp, , (1)
A815 A121), AP

where P1, P2 and G represent DMN, mimMiner and the genetic net—
work, respectively, and the diagonal sub—matrices AC, AP, and Ap2
are their adjacency matrices. The off—diagonal AGPI, AGP2 and API p2
are the adjacency matrices of the bipartite graphs connecting each
pair of the three networks, and Ag P1 , AEPZ and A};1 P2 represent their
transposes.

2.2 Predict disease—associated genes from the
integrated network

Our prediction model was based on random walk with restart,
which is a network—based ranking algorithm. The random walk
model avoids over—emphasizing the connections through high—degree
nodes and has been useful in biomedical applications (Berger et (11.,
2010; Kohler et (11., 2008; Li and Patra, 2010). It simulates a ran—
dom walker starting from a set of seed nodes and calculated the

ranking scores for all the nodes as the probability of being reached
by the random walker after convergence. We set certain disease
nodes as the seeds and ranked all the gene nodes to predict their as—
sociation with the given diseases.

We extended the algorithm by regulating the movements of the
random walker between any two networks among DMN,
mimMiner and the PPI network with the jumping probabilities ANN,
(N,,N,- E {P1,P2, G}) (Fig. 1). For example, if the random walker
stands on a node in DMN, which is connected with both mimMiner
and the genetic network, it has the option to walk to mimMiner
with the probability lplpz, to the PPI network with the probability
lplc; or stay within DMN with the probability 1—Ap1p2 —Ap1G.

We calculated the ranking scores for all nodes as follows.
Assume 170 is a vector of initial scores for each node, pk is the score
vector at step k and was iteratively updated by

Pk+1 = (1 — 7)MTPk + We. (2)

where v is the probability that the random walker restarts from the
seeds at each step, and M is the transition matrix defined based on
the adjacency matrix in (1). We assumed the update converges if the
difference between scores in adjacent iterations was smaller than
1 X e78. The transition matrix consists of three intra—network transi—
tion matrices on the diagonal, and six inter—network transition
matrices off—diagonal:

MG MGP1 MGP2
M : MEPI Mp, Mm)2 (3)
MEPZ M17;le MP2

We calculated the inter—network transition matrices in (4), which
first normalized the adjacency matrices of the bipartite network
ANiNf,(N,-, N,- E {P1,P2, G}), and then weighted them with the jump—
ing probabilities between networks N,- and Ni.

4N,N,(AN,N,)k[/Z (AN,N,)H Z (ANiNi)kl 55 0
(MNrthr : l l
0 otherwise

The intra—network transition matrices were calculated in (5), which
normalized the adjacency matrix of a network N,-, and weighted the
matrix with the probability that the random walker jumps within
the same network.

(MNr)kl I (1 - ZIN,» '/lN.»N,»)(AN.»)kr/Z (ANi)kl(ANi)kl/Z (Athr
I I
(5)

In (5), ‘-’ represents dot product and IN, is an indicator function,
whose value is 1 if the lath row of ANIN, contains at least one non——
zero element. For the generic case, where N phenotype networks
were incorporated, the transition matrix M is defined as follows:

MG MGP1  MGPN
MT Mp  Mp P
M: GP1 1 1 N . 
  Mpi 
MEPN MglPN  MPN

The inter—network transition matrices MNiNi (off—diagonal) and
intra—network transition matrices MNI, (diagonal) can still be calcu—
lated with (4) and (5), respectively.

Our gene prediction model allows accumulating evidences
from different disease phenotype networks and preserves the
unique information in each network. For example, if a pair of

diseases is connected in both DMN and mimMiner, the random
walker can reach one disease node from the other with a strength—
ened probability; if the diseases are connected in only one network,
the random walker may still reach one disease from the other
through the links between networks, but with a relatively lower

probability.

2.3 Evaluate gene prediction in cross-validation
analyses

We first performed a leave—one—out cross—validation analysis and
compared our approach with a baseline method (Li and Patra,
2010), which only used one phenotype network. We removed one
disease—gene association each time, set the disease as the seed and
tested the rank of the retained gene. If the same disease appeared in
both phenotype networks (diseases from the two networks have the
same semantic meaning) and were connected to the same gene, the
redundant disease—gene association was also removed.

We evaluated the ranks of the tested genes with two metrics: (i)
we calculated the percentage of successful prioritizations, in which
the retained genes were ranked in top 1 (excluding the other known
disease genes) and (ii) we generated a receiver operating characteris—
tic (ROC) curve for each method and calculated the area under the
curve (AUC). To generate the ROC, we followed the definitions in
Aerts et al. (2006), Kohler et al. (2008) and Li and Patra (2010): sen—
sitivity refers to the percentage of tested genes that are ranked above
a particular threshold among all prioritizations, and specificity
refers to the percentage of genes ranked below this threshold. For in—
stance, a sensitivity/specificity value of 70/90 indicates that the cor—
rect disease gene was ranked among the top 10% of genes in 70% of
the prioritizations. The ROC shows the plot of sensitivity against
1—specificity when varying the rank threshold from the top to bot—
tom. The two metrics are complimentary: the AUC evaluates the en—
tire rank of genes, while the success ratio is more strict and evaluates
the top—ranked genes.

Currently, the causal genes for over 1500 genetic disorders re—
main unknown (Antonarakis and Beckmann, 2006). A primary ad—
vantage of phenotype—driven gene prediction approaches, compared
with the conventional gene function—driven approaches, is that they
can predict genes for diseases without known genetic basis.
Therefore, we further conducted a de novo gene prediction analysis
to evaluate our approach. In de novo gene prediction, we removed
all disease—gene links for a query disease each time. If the disease ap—
peared in both phenotype networks, we removed all its gene associ—
ations through both phenotype networks. Then we set the disease as
the seed, ranked all the genes and compared the AUCs between dif—
ferent approaches. In this experiment, we have different settings
from the leave—one—out cross—validation and tested multiple retained
genes in each prioritization. We generated an ROC curve for each
prioritization following the definitions in Chen et al. (2011) and
Hwang et al. (2012) and averaged AUCs across all prioritizations.
For each ROC, sensitivity is the percentage of retained genes that
are ranked above a threshold among all the retained genes in one
prioritization, and specificity is the percentage of negative genes
(genes that are not known disease genes) ranked below the threshold
among all the negative genes. Because the top—ranked genes are
more important than the lower ranked genes, we highlighted a set of
false positive cutoffs for the ROC curves and compared the corres—
ponding average AUCs between methods. A better method will rank
more true positive genes above the false positives, resulting in larger
average AUCs at smaller cutoffs.

2.4 Evaluate gene prediction for different disease
classes

The degree that phenotypic associations reflect genetic overlaps
varies for different disease classes. Thus phenotype—driven gene pre—
dictions may have varying performance. We classified diseases into
nine groups based on International Classification of Diseases (10th
edition), and repeated the two cross—validation experiments within
each group to evaluate the performance variance of our method.

2.5 Drug discovery for Crohn's disease based on
predicted disease-associated genes

We used Crohn’s disease as an example to demonstrate that our
gene prediction method has the translation potential to guide drug
discovery. Crohn’s disease is a chronic and relapsing inﬂammatory
disorder that affects millions of people and has an increasing preva—
lence (Molodecky et (11., 2012). It involves genetic abnormalities
that lead to overly aggressive responses to commensal enteric bac—
teria (Sartor, 2006). Current treatment options, such as systemic
anti—inﬂammatory drugs, targeted drugs and surgeries, may be ef—
fective for only a subset of patients or lead to severe side effects
(Baumgart and Sandborn, 2007). Therefore, discovering new drug
therapies for Crohn’s disease is of great interests.

We first predicted genes for Crohn’s disease using our approach.
Then we compared the result with the disease—associated genes in
genome—wide association studies (GWAS) catalog (Hindorff et (11.,
2009). We also evaluated the ranks of drug genes extracted from
DrugBank (Law et (11., 2014). We hypothesized that if the predicted
genes are useful for guiding drug discovery, the top—ranked candi—
date genes would be enriched for the disease—associated genes in
GWAS and drug target genes.

Then we extracted 1190 drugs targeting on the genes in our PPI
network using the drug target data from DrugBank. We ranked
these candidate drugs based on the sum of the random walk scores
for their target genes. We validated our rank of candidate drugs
with seven FDA—approved Crohn’s disease drugs (extracted from the
drug—indication data in DrugBank), and further investigated the lit—
erature evidence for the top 200 candidate drugs.

3 Results

3.1 Integrating DMN with mimMiner significantly
improves the performance of disease gene predictions
We compared our gene prediction approach with a baseline method,
which integrated mimMiner and the PPI network used in our ap—
proach, and predicted disease gene associations with a random walk
model (Li and Patra, 2010). We chose parameters for both the meth—
ods to achieve optimal performance in the cross—validations and en—
sure fair comparison, but different parameter values only slightly
affect the results. For our method, the jumping probabilities Aplpz
and lpzp, were set to 0.1; lplc; and ﬁrsz were set to 0.7 and lap, and
lap, were set to 0.4. For the baseline method, the jumping

3.1. 1 Leave-one-out cross—validation

Our approach achieved significantly better success ratios and AUCs
than the baseline method. The integrated network in our approach
contains a total of 2397 unique disease—gene associations. If one dis—
ease appeared in the two phenotype networks and were connected
to a same gene, the two disease—gene links were counted only once.
In 1100 of the 2397 validation runs (45.89%), our approach suc—
cessfully ranked the retained genes in top 1. The success ratio is sig—
nificantly higher (P<e’4) than 10.36% for the baseline method
(Table 1). In addition, Figure 2 compares the ROC curves for gene
prediction methods. Our approach achieved an AUC of 90.65%,
which is significantly higher (P < e74) than 84.2% for the baseline
approach.

3.1.2 De novo gene prediction

Our approach is effective in de novo gene predictions, and outper—
forms the baseline method by boosting the phenotype knowledge.
Specifically, our method achieves an average AUC of 90.33%,
which is significantly higher than 81.28% for the baseline method

using mimMiner alone (P < e712)

. Figure 3 shows that at six false
positive cutoffs, integrating DMN and mimMiner achieves signifi—
cantly higher AUCs (P < e718) than using only mimMiner. For ex—
ample, at the cutoff of 10, we achieve an average AUC of 59.19%,
while that for the baseline method is 24.17% (P< e795). For the
diseases that only have one associated gene in OMIM, our method
successfully predicted the tested genes in top 1 for 52.12% of dis—
eases, while the baseline method succeeded in 11.47% prioritiza—
tions (P < e74)
highly depends on disease phenotype relationships, and our

method successfully took the advantage of more comprehensive
knowledge in multiple phenotypic networks to achieve better
performance.

3.2 Our method achieves high but varying performance
for different disease classes

We evaluated the approach for nine disease classes. In the leave—one—
out cross—validation, 93.4% retained genes was ranked within top

100, and the AUCs for all disease classes are close and above 90%.
But the ranks of the retained genes vary up and down within the top
100 for different disease classes. Figure 4 shows the top part of
ROC curves for each disease class. The corresponding AUC is the
highest for ‘congenital malformations and deformations’, and lowest
for ‘mental diseases’ and ‘malignant neoplasms’. Table 2 (the col—
umn of ‘All diseases’) compares the success ratio for all diseases be—
tween disease classes, and shows that our approach ranked 78%
retained genes for congenital malformations and deformations in
top 1, while prioritized 26% and 27% retained genes for malignant
neoplasms and mental diseases, respectively.

In the de novo gene prediction, we observed similar performance
variance among the nine disease classes. Figure 5 shows that the
averaged AUC is the highest for congenital malformations and
deformations and lowest for malignant neoplasms at all cutoffs.
Table 2 (the column of ‘Monogenetic diseases’) shows that for
monogenetic diseases, which have only one gene in OMIM, 90%
predictions ranked the disease genes for congenital malformations
and deformations in top 1, while 50% predictions succeeded for ma—
lignant neoplasms.

We traced the disease phenotype features to explain the perform—
ance variance. The congenital malformations and deformations

often have specific phenotypic features. For example, otospondylo—
megaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) has manifestations such as ‘sen—
sorineural hearing loss’ and ‘Pierre Robin syndrome’. These features
link OSMED to phenotypically similar diseases in the network, such
as Stickler syndrome and Marshall syndrome, which are also genet—
ically related to OSMED. On the other hand, malignant neoplasms
usually have non—specific manifestations, such as pain, fever and as—
cites, which are common in cancers with different genetic causes.
Therefore, although our approach achieves high performance for all
disease classes, building disease—specific models and introducing
prior knowledge of disease phenotypes may further improve the ac—
curacy of disease gene predictions.

3.3 Our gene prediction method has the potential to
guide the drug discovery for Crohn’s disease

We ranked the 9465 genes in the PPI network for Crohn’s disease
and compared the result with 70 genes associated with Crohn’s dis—
ease from GWAS catalog. These 70 genes also appeared in our gene
rank, and have no overlap with the data in OMIM. Figure 6A1
shows that the number of GWAS genes drops when the rank based
on our approach changes from the top to the bottom, while this
number distributes evenly among random ranks (Fig. 6A2). Among
the top 10% in our rank, we found 19 overlaps with the GWAS
genes, which is a 2.5—fold enrichment (P < e74) compared with the
average of 50 random gene ranks. The result shows that our ap—
proach can prioritize the disease—associated genes obtained through
statistical analysis on large—scale patient data.

Among the top genes in our rank, we found RIPK2, NLRC4 and
ERBIN, which have substantial literature supports on their roles in
Crohn’s disease (Gerard et 41]., 2013; Jostins et 41]., 2012; Kufer
et 41]., 2006; Lupfer et 41]., 2013; Philpott et 41]., 2014; Standaert—
Vitse et 41]., 2009; Tomalka et 41]., 2011) and directly interact with
NOD2 (a Crohn’s disease gene in OMIM). In addition, we also
found literature evidence to support a few top—ranked genes that are
not directly interacting with the disease genes from OMIM and were
not identified in GWAS. For example, NLRP3 (ranked top 32),
CASP1 (ranked top 45) and BCL10 (ranked top 46) are associated

that our rank is more likely to prioritize druggable genes than the
random ranks. The top 10% genes in our rank contain 331 drug tar—
get genes, which is a 2.1—fold enrichment (P < e721) compared with
the average of random cases. The result shows that our top—ranked
predicted genes are enriched for druggable genes associated with
Crohn’s disease, and offer the opportunities to detect candidate
drugs for Crohn’s disease.

We ranked 1190 candidate drugs (from DrugBank) based on the

sum of the random walk scores for their target genes. Figure 6C1

and C2 shows that our approach can prioritize the approved
Crohn’s disease therapies. The top 200 in our rank contains four
FDA—approved drugs, which is a 3.3—fold enrichment (P < e73 ) com—
pared with the average of random cases. Note that these four
approved drugs, including Sulfasalazine, Mesalazine, Adalimumab
and Natalizumab, do not directly target on the Crohn’s disease
genes in OMIM, and were detected through the prioritized genes
using our approach. We further investigated the other candidate
drugs in top 200 in our rank, and found that a number of them are

4 Conclusion and discussions

Incorporating clinical phenotype data can improve the prediction
power of disease gene discovery methods. In this study, we de—
veloped a disease gene prediction framework leveraging multiple dif—
ferent human phenotype data sources. We explored a unique
phenotype data source and constructed a new phenotype network
called DMN. We designed an innovative strategy to predict disease—
associated genes from the heterogeneous network combining DMN
with mimMiner (a widely used phenotype database) and a genetic
network. Comparing with the gene prediction approach using only
one phenotype network, our approach significantly improved the
performance through boosting phenotypic knowledge. Using
Crohn’s disease as an example, we demonstrated that our gene pre—
diction result has translational potentials to guide drug discovery.

As more human disease phenotype data become available, our
approach can be further improved by integrating new disease pheno—
type networks, given that the new networks contain different know—
ledge. For example, our approach in this study included many
Mendelian diseases. Adding phenotypic associations involving com—
mon complex diseases may offer novel insights. Also, the phenotypic
relationships in this study are primarily based on disease—manifest—
ation pairs. Other kinds of disease phenotype data, such as disease
co—morbidities and gene expression profiles, may also reﬂect differ—
ent aspects of genetic mechanisms. In the future, we will develop
new approaches to rationally integrate heterogeneous phenotype
data. For common complex diseases, we will also incorporate mul—
tiple different types of genetic associations besides the PPI network,
such as the gene regulatory network into the approach.

In addition, phenotype—driven disease gene prediction
approaches are effective at different degrees for disease classes (as
we have demonstrated) and among different patients. Building dis—
ease—specific and patient—specific computational models may further
improve the quality of disease gene predictions. We recently studied
cancer—specific comorbidities and analyzed the variation of comor—
bidity patterns among stratified patients in different age and gender
brackets (Chen and Xu, 2014a, b). Based on these results, we plan
to build a cancer—specific gene prediction model.

Currently, we directly used disease—gene associations in drug dis—
covery. The method to identifying candidate drugs can be further
enhanced if more detailed information is available, including drug
actions and disease pathogenesis, such as the direction of the genetic
abnormality. For example, if a disease results from the loss of func—
tion, agonists will be potential drugs, whereas antagonists will lead

to side effects. In the future work, we will develop rational drug dis—
covery approach on the basis of our result and more data on both
diseases and drugs.

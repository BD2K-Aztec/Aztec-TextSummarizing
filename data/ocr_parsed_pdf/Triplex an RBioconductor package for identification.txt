ABSTRACT

Motivation: Upgrade and integration of triplex software into the
R/Bioconductor framework.

Results: We combined a previously published implementation of a trip-
lex DNA search algorithm with visualization to create a versatile
R/Bioconductor package ‘triplex’. The new package provides functions
that can be used to search Bioconductor genomes and other DNA
sequence data for occurrence of nucleotide patterns capable of forming
intramolecular triplexes (H-DNA). Functions producing 2D and 3D dia-
grams of the identified triplexes allow instant visualization of the search
results. Leveraging the power of Biostrings and GRanges classes, the
results get fully integrated into the existing Bioconductor framework,
allowing their passage to other Genome visualization and annotation
packages, such as GenomeGraphs, rtracklayer or Gviz.

Availability: R package ‘triplex’ is available from Bioconductor
(bioconductororg).

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA sequence analysis and annotation are important steps in
uncovering the molecular basis of life. Although protein-coding
sequences have been intensively studied in the past, recent focus
has shifted toward the less-known biological functions encoded
in intergenic DNA, as well as the study of structural and regu-
latory aspects of genetic information packaging in chromosomes.
Tools for the necessary sequence analysis of non-coding
sequences are less common than their gene-centered counter-
parts. We have recently formulated and implemented an algo-
rithm to detect potential triplex-forming sequences in genomes
(Lexa et al., 2011). Such sequences have been implicated as im-
portant players in several key processes, such as transcriptional
regulation (Walter et al., 2001) or DNA recombination (Rooney
and Moore, 1995).

bonds to stabilize the nascent structure (Soyfer and Potaman,
1995). H—DNA is a form of DNA where triplexes form intramo-
lecularly, without the participation of other DNA molecules
(Htun and Dahlberg, 1989).

Currently, several research groups reported on their efforts to
map triplex-forming sites in known genomes, as well as on the
development of tools to carry out such searches. Hoyne et al.
(2000) used pattern recognition tools to search for homopurine/
homopyrimidine stretches in DNA as likely triplex formation
sites. Cer et al. (2012) created a non-B DNA search tool
(nBMST) that includes mirror repeat detection functionality to
identify potential triplexes. Buske et al. (2012) and Lexa et al.
(2011) created triplex detection procedures allowing for a small
percentage of imperfections in the sequences, leading to higher
sensitivity of searches. Often, the tools exist as stand-alone soft-
ware or web tools, which led us to the idea to integrate triplex
search, Visualization and genome annotation into a uniﬁed
Bioconductor software package in R for increased ﬂexibility.

Here, we describe triplex, demonstrating its use in sequence
analysis of sample data, focusing on functions integrating it with
the rest of the R/Bioconductor suite. Of the aforementioned soft-
wares, only triplex provides specialized H-DNA searching. The
other software treats H—DNA as general mirror repeats and lacks
fine-grained or conﬁgurable mismatch evaluation (nBMST),
focuses on a different class of triplexes (Hoyne et al., 2000) or
provides general results that need to be further filtered to identify
H-DNA (triplexator), requiring several orders of processing time
more than triplex. The software by Lexa et al. (2011) used
to create the package was improved by (i) integration into
R/Bioconductor, (ii) elimination of recognized bugs in scoring
and alignment and by (iii) providing base pair information, either
as text/variables or Visualizations.

We performed a simple comparison of nBMST and triplexator
programs with triplex (see Supplementary Material). It showed
that reported (CT)n and (TA)n mirror repeats coincide with
H-DNA found by triplex. Triplexator returned several longer
patterns reported by triplex in fragments, a problem that may
depend on precise settings, although we found computation time
and memory use increased signiﬁcantly at such attempts. This is
likely caused by triplexator design to ﬁnd any combinations of
triplex-forming sequences, not only local patterns leading to
H—DNA.

2 THE SOFTWARE

The R triplex package is essentially an R interface to the under-
lying C implementation of a dynamic-programming search strat-
egy of the same name (Lexa et al., 2011). The main functionality
of the original program was to detect the positions of subse-
quences in a much larger sequence capable of folding into an
intramolecular triplex (H—DNA) made of as many canonical nu-
cleotide triplets as possible. We extended this basic functionality
to include the calculation of exact base pairing in the triple helices.
This allowed us to include Visualization, showing the exact base
pairing in 1D, 2D or 3D (see Section 3). The created package
takes advantage of the existing Bioconductor infrastructure. For
example, the triplex search method uses the DNAString object as
input. As a result, all available genomes (BSgenomes objects) can
be easily analyzed. As for the output, identiﬁed triplexes are
stored in data objects of a class based on XStringViews. Thus,
all other libraries or methods working with [Ranges can be
applied to triplexes as well. Alternatively, the results can be trans-
formed into GRanges objects that enable further possibilities, such
as Visualization of genome tracks using GenomeGraphs or export
of results to the GFF3 annotation format.

3 USAGE EXAMPLE

In the following example, we load a genomic sequence from one
of the BSGenome packages, identify potential triplexes with
length over eight triplets of nucleotides and score 317, create
two different Visualizations of the best-scored triplex. Finally,
we export the identiﬁed positions into a genome annotation
track (Via a GFF3 ﬁle) and store the sequences in a FASTA ﬁle.

4 CONCLUSION

We present a new R/Bioconductor package that integrates our
previously deﬁned algorithm for identiﬁcation of triplex-forming
sequences with two new methods of their Visualization (2D dia-
gram and 3D model). The created package uses existing
Bioconductor infrastructure in such way that available genomes
(BSGenomes) can easily be used as input. The identiﬁed triplexes
can be further analyzed as [Ranges or GRanges objects (and
optionally exported into GFF3 or FASTA file). In connection
with R language and existing libraries for statistical analysis, the
package represents powerful tool for molecular biologists inter-
ested in analysis of non-canonical DNA structures such as
triplexes.

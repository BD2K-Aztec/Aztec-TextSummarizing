ABSTRACT

Motivation: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have dramatically
improved the atomistic understanding of protein motions, energetics
and function. These growing datasets have necessitated a
corresponding emphasis on trajectory analysis methods for
characterizing simulation data, particularly since functional protein
motions and transitions are often rare and/or intricate events.
Observing that such events give rise to long-tailed spatial
distributions, we recently developed a higher-order statistics based
dimensionality reduction method, called quasi-anharmonic analysis
(QAA), for identifying biophysically-relevant reaction coordinates
and substates within MD simulations. Further characterization of
conformation space should consider the temporal dynamics specific
to each identified substate.

Results: Our model uses hierarchical clustering to learn energetically
coherent substates and dynamic modes of motion from a 0.5 us
ubiqutin simulation. Autoregressive (AR) modeling within and
between states enables a compact and generative description of
the conformational landscape as it relates to functional transitions
between binding poses. Lacking a predictive component, QAA
is extended here within a general AR model appreciative of the
trajectory’s temporal dependencies and the specific, local dynamics
accessible to a protein within identified energy wells. These
metastable states and their transition rates are extracted within
a QAA-derived subspace using hierarchical Markov clustering to
provide parameter sets for the second-order AR model. We show
the learned model can be extrapolated to synthesize trajectories of
arbitrary length.

1 INTRODUCTION

Conformational changes in proteins constitute the underlying
behavior of cellular regulation. As part of regulating cellular
homeostasis, proteins perform a number of functions through
native ﬂuctuations at multiple length- and timescales. A variety
of experimental techniques have illuminated the linkage between
protein dynamics and function; however, resolving the precise
spatio-temporal relationships in protein motions which confer
biological function remains a long-standing challenge in protein
biochemistry (Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Governing the protein’s rich conformational space is a high-
dimensional energy landscape with multiple hills and valleys (Elber
and Karplus, 1987; Frauenfelder et (11., 1988, 1991). To characterize
this energy surface, theoretical and computational modeling
of protein dynamics have been widely used (Agarwal, 2006;
Bahar and Cui, 2003), as have molecular dynamics (MD) and
Monte Carlo techniques to provide atomistic insights into protein
ﬂuctuation (Karplus and McCammon, 2002). These techniques are
now being extensively used to investigate various biophysical and
biochemical processes including protein-ligand binding (Simonson
et (11., 2002), protein folding (Balbach et (11., 1995; Bowman G. and
Pande, 2010) and enzyme catalysis (Agarwal, 2006).

As the timescales accessible to all-atom MD (and other coarse-
grained approaches) continue to reach the micro- and milli-
second timescales, the data generated from such simulations can
potentially reach 0(petabytes). The availability of large datasets
that cover the native-state dynamics and folding and unfolding
pathways of the entire foldome, called Dynameomics (van der
Kamp et (11., 2010), has allowed scientists to simulate over 2000
proteins with a combined timescale of 340 its. Projects such as
Folding@home (Beberg et (11., 2009) have also accelerated the
availability of large datasets of protein folding trajectories as
have specialized hardware, such as Anton (Shaw et (11., 2007),
ﬁeld-programmable gate-arrays (FPGA; Alam et (11., 2007), and
GPUs (Harvey et (11., 2009).

The availability of such datasets, while useful, has created
new challenges in (i) extracting low-dimensional, biophysically
relevant coordinates that elucidate how the protein functions
(for example, how a protein recognizes its binding partner),
(ii) separating the landscape spanned by the simulations (or even
groups of simulations) into a coherent set of conformational
substates, (iii) quantifying the intrinsic structural and dynamical
properties within a substate and ﬁnally, (iv) determining
transition rates between these conformational substates. Indeed,
important dynamical phenomena within simulated trajectories
must be extracted from an enormous quantity of non-speciﬁc,
ambient ﬂuctuations. Clustering techniques for mining this noisy
conformational space often use structural similarity measures, such
as root-mean square deviation (RMSD) which quantiﬁes an average
value of structural deviation. However, functional motions need not
elicit large global RMSD values; indeed, localized protein regions
commonly exhibit small but important ﬂexibility.

These observations motivated us to examine the statistical nature
of atomic ﬂuctuations from long timescale simulations (Ramanathan
et (11., 2009, 2011b). Our studies across multiple simulations (and

QAARM reveals molecular recognition pathways

 

multiple force-ﬁelds) reveal that functionally relevant motions
generally occur rarely. These events are reﬂected in higher-
order correlations, manifested in long-tailed spatial (ﬂuctuation)
distributions (Mao et al., 1982). Techniques reliant on second-
order statistics (variance) are poorly suited to resolve such higher-
order correlations in the data, and we have observed that linear
orthogonal bases (as in principal component analysis (Amadei et al.,
1993)) poorly describe some energy landscapes. Thus, the current
frameworks to analyze long timescale trajectories do not guarantee
that identiﬁed substates are correlated with biophysically relevant
events.

We recently put forward a low-dimensional representation of
protein motions at long timescales using a novel technique, quasi-
anharmonic analysis (QAA; Ramanathan et al., 2011a). QAA
partitions the conformational landscape using fourth-order spatial-
ﬂuctuation statistics and detects substates with energetic coherence.
Each region contains conformers that show similarity with respect to
biophysically relevant order parameters. The insights gained from
QAA were effectively used to resolve higher-order dependencies
in spatial ﬂuctuations in the context of molecular recognition and
enzyme catalysis.

While QAA effectively captures spatial correlations, it lacks
a stochastic model of the underlying dynamics and substate
transitions. To address this shortcoming, we build autoregressive
(AR) models to both encode local protein dynamics accessible
within energetically coherent substates and permit transitions
between connected regions in the landscape. We call this method
the quasi-anharmonic autoregressive model (QAARM). Within a
QAA-derived subspace, metastable states and their transition rates
are extracted using hierarchical Markov clustering which provides
parameter sets for the second-order AR model. We show that the
learned AR model can be extrapolated to synthesize trajectories of
arbitrary length. We exploit the time-invariant statistical regularities
within protein motions to investigate equilibrium ﬂuctuations of
ubiquitin, a widely studied protein involved in the proteosomal
degradation pathway. We show that QAARM can extract and
synthesize pathways by which ubiquitin adapts its binding surface
to recognize a variety of substrates.

2 REUMED\NORK

Previous studies have focused on the use of AR models in
the frequency domain to understand memory functions in MD
simulations (Kneller and Hinsen, 2001). The approach has been used
to interpret quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments (Kneller,
2005) and to accelerate MD simulations (Brutovsky et al., 2003).
Using principal component analysis (PCA), Alakent et al. (2005a)
pursued time-series analysis of MD simulations (Alakent et al.,
2004, 2005b, 2007) to hierarchically describe the energy landscape
and analyze explicit solvent effects on protein dynamics. However,
PCA-based representations and their extensions are limited in
their description of the conformational landscape (Balsera et al.,
1996; Tai et al., 2008) due to assumed Gaussian ﬂuctuations, and
hence such approaches may not sufﬁciently describe conformational
diversity (Lange and Grubmuller, 2006, 2008).

More recent kinetic modeling, based on Markov state models
(MSM), can describe the kinetics associated with protein
folding (Bowman G. and Pande, 2010; Chodera et al., 2007; West
et al., 2007). MSMs commonly use RMSD values to ﬁrst cluster

simulation conformations into kinetically accessible micro-states
and then iteratively merge these micro-states into several macro-
states. MSMs can provide insights into macro-state dwell times
(residence time) and can characterize mean ﬁrst passage times.
However, structure-based clustering need not result in energetically
coherent substates. Our complementary but generative approach
here explicitly pursues energetically coherent substates clusters
which correspond intuitively to separated energy wells. Chiang et al.
(2010) recently developed a related approach based on Markov
dynamic models (MDM), which includes a set of hidden states
to capture conformational dependencies. The generative models
resulting from MDM were applied on small systems such as alanine
dipeptide. In comparison, we illustrate our results on real proteins
such as ubiquitin and also demonstrate the utility of our approach
to reveal molecular recognition pathways.

3 APPROACH

An overview of QAARM is shown in Figure 1. MD simulation data
is ﬁrst processed to remove rotational and translational degrees of
freedom. QAA is then applied (Section 5) which outputs a reduced
dimensional representation of the original MD data. Motivated to
detect biophysically relevant energy wells, or highly populated
regions, in the low-dimensional QAA space, we next use a simple
Markov diffusion model to cluster the conformations into meta-
stable substates (Section 6). Local dynamics within each substate
are then captured by a linear, second-order AR model (Section 7)
which explicitly models spatial ﬂuctuations. The AR model thus
extends the time-insensitive QAA model by considering temporal
relationships between successive MD frames.

output of QAA is a reduced dimensional space. in which conformers clustered
together represent micro-states. This reduced-dimensional space is then input
into a Markov diffusion framework to identify clusters of conformations that
are kinetically accessible. These clusters represent metastable macro-states.
We then build second order AR models for each substate to identify pathways
between metastable states.

4 MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION OF
HUMAN UBIQUITIN

Ubiquitin, a small globular protein, is involved in the proteosomal
degradation pathway. It consists of 76 residues and folds into a
well deﬁned ﬂ-grasp fold. Ubiquitin’s structure is evolutionarily
conserved across all eukaryotes, consisting of ﬁve anti-parallel f3-
strands (51—55) as well as two ot-helices. The primary binding
surface (R1 in Fig. 3) of ubiquitin is composed of a small number
of residues proximal to the ﬂexible 51—52 and 53 — 54 loops. A
secondary binding interface consists of the 54 —012 region. Ubiquitin
binds to over 300 or more targets in the human cell and naturally has
been the focus of many experimental and computational efforts to
characterize molecular recognition (Meisenberg et al., 2006). With
a large number of crystal structures and NMR conformers available
(both substrate-free and substrate-bound), ubiquitin provides an
ideal platform for studying protein dynamics in the context of
biomolecular recognition.

The protocol for simulating ubiquitin in solution has been
described in detail in Ramanathan and Agarwal (2009). Brieﬂy,
eight crystal structures of ubiquitin (PDB codes: 1UBQ, 1P3Q,
1S1Q, 1TBE, 1YIW, 2D3G, 2G45 and 2FCQ) were used for our
simulation. Each simulation was carried out using the AMBER
suite of tools, and each production run lasted a total of 62.5
ns. Hydrogen atoms were simulated using SHAKE algorithm,
while electrostatics were evaluated using the particle mesh-ewald
(PME) technique. A cut-off of 10A was used for long-range
interactions (electrostatic and van der Waals). Conformations were
stored every picosecond resulting in a total of 62,500 conformations
per simulation. The simulations cumulatively constitute 0.5 us of
sampling in the ubiquitin landscape. For analyses only C“ atoms
were used. All trajectory processing was performed with MATLAB.

5 QUASI-ANHARMONIC REPRESENTATION OF
PROTEIN DYNAMICS

QAA is a general, statistically rigorous approach to identify
non-Gaussian and rare behavior within extensive atomistic MD
trajectories. It utilizes higher-order statistics of protein motions
and is not restricted to orthogonal basis directions, a major
compromise of existing techniques. QAA identiﬁes energetically
coherent substates in the conformational hierarchy and also
possible transitions between these substates, consistent with the
understanding that proteins sample from a hierarchical, multi-
level energy landscape, with minima/maxima separated by energy
barriers (Frauenfelder et al., 1988, 1991). Internal protein motions,
driven by thermal energy in the solvent, enable proteins to explore
this rugged landscape.

Here, we summarize quasi-anharmonic representation of protein
motions in long timescale simulation trajectories based on
diagonalization of a tensor of fourth-order statistics. This tensor
describes positional ﬂuctuations and their couplings. We use
an efﬁcient algebraic technique called joint-diagonalization of
cumulant matrices (JADE), a well known algorithm in the machine
learning literature for analyzing multi-variate data (Cardoso, 1999).

First, we assume that overall rotation/translation degrees of
freedom have been removed and hence that positional ﬂuctuations
36 are centered around the origin. Second, second-order correlations
are removed from the ﬂuctuation data. In particular, a covariance

matrix G is estimated: G:E{3€3€T}, which is then diagonalized by

orthogonal eigenvectors B and eigenvalues 2 using G=BZBT,
followed by elimination of second-order correlations in 35 with 62 =
XVI/237"}, leaving E{&&T} :1, an identity matrix of size 3N >< 3N
for N atoms under consideration.

Third, a fourth order cumulant tensor [6 is estimated comprising
both auto- and cross-cumulants given by

K(ai>=E{a;‘}—3E2{a,?}, (1)

and

Kalli,ajyak7a1)=E{aiyaj7ak7051}_E{aivaj}E{ak7al}
_E{ai7ak}E{ajial}_E{ai7al}E{ak7aj}7 (2)

respectively. This expression is ﬁlrther simpliﬁed because E {EtEtT} =
I, and hence E{Oii01j} :1 when i=j and 0 when iyéj. The cumulant
tensor will have a total 3N >< (3N + 1) /2 matrices each of size 3N ><
3N accounting for auto- and cross-cumulant terms.

Fourth, the fourth order dependencies denoted by the sum of
the cross-cumulant terms are minimized, a procedure equivalent
to diagonalizing the tensor [6. No closed form solution exists
for diagonalizing a tensor, however an approximate solution can
be found using efﬁcient algebraic techniques, such as Jacobi
rotations (Golub and Van Loan, 1996). Just as the eigenbasis B
diagonalizes the covariance matrix G, a rotation matrix J can be
found which approximately diagonalizes the cumulant tensor [6,
leading to:

v?» = 161. (3)
Substituting for (it from above:
Vv=12_1/ZBT§E, (4)
and thus v7» = U‘l)? implying
U=le/21T. (5)

Thus, U represents anharmonic modes of motion derived by
minimizing the fourth-order dependencies in positional ﬂuctuations,
in addition to eliminating the second-order correlations (as is the
case with quasi-harmonic analysis). Unlike in approaches that use
principal component analysis, U can be non-orthogonal and hence
intrinsically coupled. The anharmonic modes of motion Ui, each a
column vector of matrix U, are sorted decreasingly by amplitude
(“Ui ll).

Finally, we paint each conformer in the QAA subspace by internal
energy, the sum of electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions
(computed with NAMDenergy; Phillips et al., 2005) over each
conformation. We emphasize that resultant energy coherence within
observed substates is an emergent property of the method, that is,
conformer internal energies are not considered during the projection
onto the QAA subspace.

5.1 Results: organizing ubiquitin conformational
landscape into energetically homogenous regions

From the original simulation consisting of nearly 500 000
conformations (0.5 us), 10000 equally spaced conformations were
collected for training the QAA basis. We performed QAA within a
30-dimensional subspace which covers 95% of the input variance.
The anharmonic modes of motion reveal the exquisite ability of
ubiquitin to modulate both the primary and secondary binding

originated. Illustrative examples of cluster centers are shown as colored

surfaces (131—132 and 133—134; (34—012), as shown in Figure 2.
In addition, the distances between 131—132 and 133—134 can also
serve as order parameters to describe the anharmonic landscape
spanned by our simulations. Motions along each of the anharmonic
modes permits ubiquitin to adopt a conformation that resembles
the substrate-bound conformation. Our AR models will be deemed
successful if they can recover this property.

6 HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING FOR
METASTABLE SUBSTATES

Energy wells in the 30-dimensional QAA-space determine
biophysically relevant substates; the structure and dynamics
of each can be characterized through clustering. Neighboring
conformers in QAA-space have similar internal energies (cf.
Fig. 2) and thus are dynamically and kinetically related. To
facilitate clustering, we model the MD trajectory as an undirected
network where edges connect energetically adjacent conformers
in QAA-space. We can then cluster this network using a
hierarchical Markov diffusion framework. This approach is an
adaptation of our earlier work developing spectral graph partitioning
algorithms for segmenting natural images (Chennubhotla and
Jepson, 2003, 2005), understanding protein dynamics and allosteric
propagation (Chennubhotla and Bahar, 2006, 2007a), and relating
signal propagation on a protein structure to its equilibrium dynamics
(Chennubhotla and Bahar, 2007b).

We begin hierarchical clustering by constructing a Markov
transition matrix using edge weights between conformer pairs.
Weights are chosen according to distance within QAA-space
between connected conformers.

We then initiate a Markov chain (or random walk) on the weighted
undirected network. As Markov transition probabilities homogenize
through difﬁision, an implicit clustering emerges from the network.
First, a set of nodes representing the putative clusters are identiﬁed.
Then, a Markov transition matrix is newly constructed using this
reduced representation. The principle behind this construction is
that upon reaching a stationary distribution at the coarsest hierarchy
level, the Markov chain has also converged at ﬁner (more local)
network levels. This consistency regulates the overall topology of
the network and helps build a multi-resolution representation of
metastable states.

We expect that ﬁne-grained hierarchy levels will produce many
small clusters containing close neighbors in QAA space; that is, most
cluster members will be from the same time-window (and single
trajectory). As Markov diffusion progresses (ﬁne-grained to coarse),
conformers that are more distant neighbors will be connected by
edges in the diffused network, and will therefore be assigned to
the same cluster. Thus, the hierarchical clustering can highlight
dynamical connections between conformers at different timescales.

6.1 Markov diffusion framework

Initiation: the MD simulation is modeled as an undirected graph
by placing an edge with weight 1 from each data point to its six
nearest Euclidean neighbors in the QAA space. At hierarchy level
t=0, each data point is considered a node. Let no be the number
of trajectory frames. The no ><n0 adjacency matrix C0 gives the
edge weights between each data point pair and the no x no diagonal
degree matrix D0 (Step 1) gives the connectivity at each node in
that Dt(i,i) contains the total number of connections to node i at
hierarchy level t. Nodes with high degrees can be seen as hubs, and
nodes with very low degrees can be seen as isolates. The stationary

distribution of the Markov chain is given by the normalized degree

where  0;(i,j) = 1. The ownership matrix gives the probability
distribution for the likelihood that a data point belongs to any
metastable state of the trajectory, providing a soft partitioning of
the data. A hard partitioning is determined by assigning each data
point to the cluster to which it has maximal ownership probability.

6.2 Results: characterizing metastable substates in the
ubiquitin landscape

The connectivity matrix CO at clustering initialization is shown in
Figure 3. The connectivity matrix shows several regions of high
cross-talk. Iterative diffusion of the Markov chain derived from
this connectivity matrix, followed by kernel selection, results in six
hierarchy levels with 10000, 4486, 978, 78, 11, and 2 clusters at
each respective level.

To provide parameters for the AR model (Section 7), a
membership threshold must be chosen that is ﬁne enough to capture
local dynamics, but still coarse enough to allow ﬂexibility. We
chose a membership threshold such that all cluster members were
reachable from the cluster center within 50 ps, where a substate’s
center is deﬁned as the closest conformer to the mean of that substate.
The mean QAA-space distance between conformers in successive

frames is d, and the standard deviation is ad. The hierarchy level at

which 99.7% of the conformers are within (1 +3ad of their substate
center is selected for ﬁirther processing. Following this criterion, AR
analysis was pursued using statistics from level 4 of the hierarchy.

Four cluster centers from the connectivity matrix are shown
for example clusters in Figure 3. Clusters can be mapped from
QAA-space onto the connectivity matrix to visualize accessibility
between substates. As an example, dynamically distant clusters
are illustrated in Figure 3 by the red and green enclosed regions.
The metastable substates identiﬁed share signiﬁcant similarities
in both conformational and energetic space, however, they do
not interact directly in QAA-space. This produces a partitioning
of the landscape that is quite unique from the perspective of
understanding ubiquitin’s equilibrium ﬂuctuations: the landscapes’s
extrema represent distinct conformations of ubiquitin’s binding
regions. Note that while 131—132 and 133—134 adapt an ‘open’
conformation in the structure shown in green (average separation
of over 18A), the red structure shows the binding regions ‘close’
to each other (average separation of 13.5 A). Thus, the inherent
motions of ubiquitin involve sampling the two metastable states
with almost exclusively no cross-talk. However, note that both the
red and green structures can interconvert between the metastable

is modeled with the adjacency matrix C0 shown here. The Markov diffusion
produces a total of 78 macro-states at level 4 of the hierarchy. To illustrate
the extremum points in the network. we depict two representative clusters

states highlighted in gray. These metastable states represent the so-
called intermediates which are necessarily visited before sampling
either open or close conformations. Intermediate metastable states
also highlight the importance of ancillary structural changes that
ubiquitin might have to undergo in order to sample either the open or
close conformations. These changes are predominantly located along
132 — a1 and the C-terminal tip of a1 helix. Thus, for the opening and
closing of the binding region in ubiquitin, our pathways deduced
from the Markov transition matrices reveal that it is energetically
more favorable to undergo conformational changes along the two
regions highlighted in gray.

7 BUILDING AR MODELS

Motivated by the need for a compact, linear and generative model
of ubiquitin’s dynamics, we extend our ﬁndings from QAA and
hierarchical clustering with a stochastic AR model inspired by
problems in control theory and signal processing (Blake and
Isard, 1998). Understood as a second-order stochastic differential
equation that has been sampled at regular intervals, the model
relates each successive protein conformation to the previous two.
It consists of an appearance model and a dynamic model, which
can be conceptualized, respectively, as encoding the protein in
a meaningful low-dimensional (embedded) space and modeling
characteristic motions within that subspace. Because we learn
summarizing parameters for the protein’s dynamics in the model,
we can synthesize extrapolated trajectories of arbitrary length. As
a contrast to molecular dynamics methods, where the system and
environment are simulated and dynamics result, the approach here
models dynamics explicitly and exploits the statistical regularities
intrinsic to a natively ﬂuctuating protein. Within this approach, time-
evolution of the protein’s conformation 36; results from coupling the

where weights VT»; constitute the projection of 35; onto the subspace
spanned by U, or its state. Determining a physically meaningful
subset of basis vectors, and the vectors themselves, is frustrated
by the enormous conformational space accessible to a ﬂuctuating
protein. A poor choice of basis vectors (or selecting too few) would
increase the reconstruction error 3; upon mapping each embedded
state back to ﬁill conformational space. The basis chosen here,
U,ins the ﬁrst 30 anharmonic modes which are extracted using
QAA and which span the conformational subspace available to
the dynamic model. Both deterministic and stochastic elements are
contained in the model’s dynamic component [Equation (7)]. The
deterministic element is a second order Markov model in which the
state at time t, v72), is a linear combination of states Wt_1 and vii/#2.
Stochasticity is introduced by the Gaussian driving distribution 17;,
which quantiﬁes motions that are not fully captured by the linear
model. More temporal information is available to this model than
to a ﬁrst order model; we show that this permits characterization
of complex motion patterns that extend over several timeframes (or
MD conformations during training). Distinct from the connectivity
matrix in Section 4, the transition matrices A1 and A2 here constitute
the second-order transition matrices of the stochastic process and
must be learned from training simulation data. In the following
subsections we address learning these dynamical model parameters
and generating synthetic trajectories.

7.1 Learning the dynamical model

The dynamical model, Equation (7), exploits our knowledge of past
states (conformations) to propose a ﬁiture state. Before we can
compute transition matrices A1 and A2 from training data, we ﬁrst
project the ubiquitin simulation into the embedded 30-dimensional
QAA-space to yield training states v72):

a, E UTX, (8)

where columns of X, 351 “JET, are 3N vectors carrying the protein’s
coordinates (for N residues). Following the derivation put forward
in Hyndman (2007), the AR model is deﬁned sequentially over the
weights:

17134 BAN/133 +A2VT/2

VVT BA1V7/T—11—142V7/T—2
(9)

with unknowns A1 and A2. We concatenate state vectors and
transition matrices with the notation Wisj E [VT/,- fizz-+1 “177] and AE
[A1 A2] to express the system in matrix form:

Interpreted physically, each A1 and A2 pair encodes the local, time

invariant dynamics. The eigen-decomposition of [[96 All] yields the

exponential decay constants 5m = %log AL for these local dynamics,
where Am < 1 denotes any positive eigenvalue (Fig. 4B).

7.2 Synthesizing new motion sequences

The learned transition matrices A1 and A2, unique to each cluster,
can be used to generate novel structure sequences of arbitrary
length. That is, VT); and 36; now constitute the unknowns in
Equations (6) and (7). Starting from a randomly selected frame
from our training trajectory, we propagate the model using only
the learned transition matrices. Within the QAA space deﬁned by
the column vectors of U, we compare each generated conformer
to the mean structure of every cluster. At every step, the nascent
trajectory is assigned to the cluster center with nearest Euclidean
distance, and permitted to evolve according to that cluster’s A1,
A2, and 71} until it moves closer to a different cluster center. We
generated a synthetic trajectory of 25 000 frames, during which
the protein visited 76 of the 78 clusters present in the training
data (cluster membership for 10000 training and testing frames is
shown in Fig. 4). Other than error/transition parameters and the
determined local mean of each cluster, no temporal information
from the training data was necessary for the time-evolution of
ubiquitin’s dynamics. Additionally, it should be noted that the
entirety of the generative process is carried out in the embedded
QAA subspace, and the appearance model, Equation (6), is only
used in post processing to return to ﬁill, 3N conformation space.
We can conceptualize each substate’s transition matrices as linearly
encoding local dynamics, whereas reconstruction information from
embedded to ﬁill conformational space is carried in the QAA basis
vectors U. Far less storage and computing resources are required
to propagate the AR-derived dynamics than with conventional
sampling. Temporally, the synthetic trajectory employs the same
time step found in the training data; the 25 000 synthetic trajectory
frames compares with approximately 25 ns of MD simulation.

7.3 Results: predicted pathways of molecular
recognition in ubiquitin

The underlying stochastic dynamical model allows us to synthesize
new conformations of arbitrary length. This is particularly useﬁil
when one has to predict the binding mode of ubiquitin with another
protein. Note that in our simulations, ubiquitin was simulated in its
substrate-free form. Hence, no explicit knowledge of the substrate-
bound form was available. However, when we synthesize 25 000
conformers from QAARM, its utility becomes quite evident. The
conformers show remarkable ﬂuctuations along the ﬂexible regions
of ubiquitin (highlighted in Fig. 5A). Further, these motions are
largely similar to the ﬂuctuations in the ubiquitin simulations, as
evidenced by projecting the synthesized conformations back onto
the QAA basis vectors.

It is also interesting to note that the projection of the synthesized
conformers onto the QAA basis space reveals novel pathways of

 

Fig. 5. Synthesized conformations from QAARM reveal novel binding
modes of ubiquitin substrate. (A) A movie-like representation of the
ﬂuctuations in ubiquitin synthesized from the QAARM model. Note that
regions undergoing large conformational changes include the binding
regions and the ancillary regions of ubiquitin. These motions have a direct
implication on binding a variety of substrates. (B) Synthetically generated
25000 conformers are projected back onto the QAA bases to reveal the
number of potential contacts that each of the synthesized conformer can
make with a known substrate. Rabex 5. Note that the substate highlighted
by the ellipse consists of a small number of conformers in the synthesized
data that can form a large number of contacts with Rabex 5.

ubiquitin binding. To illustrate this, we chose the PDB id: 2FIF
where ubiquitin interacts with Rabex-5 along the secondary binding
site of ubiquitin (52 —011 and 53 — 54 interface). We computed the
estimated number of contacts each synthesized conformer would
form if it were to be superimposed onto the crystal structure. Since
we use only C“ atoms to generate the conformers, we consider
two atoms to be in contact whenever they are separated by less
than 7.3 A (a standard practice in coarse-graining literature (Bahar
and Cui, 2003)). The results of this computation are illustrated
in Figure 5B. By projecting the synthesized conformers onto the
QAA basis space, we discover that a small number of conformers
(highlighted by the ellipse) form a large number of contacts with the
substrate. Furthermore, the other parts of the landscape (in QAA)
show meager contacts with the substrate. This allows us to pin-point
a speciﬁc mechanism by which only a small number of the generated
conformers can bind to ubiquitin in a speciﬁc manner. Although it
remains to be seen if these conformations are also energetically
favorable, we believe that QAARM has allowed one to predict
complex formation by exploiting the statistical regularities in the
substrate-free simulations of ubiquitin. Thus, in line with previous
studies that proposed conformational selection to be a predominant
pathway for recognizing binding partners in ubiquitin (Lange et al.,
2008), our studies also predict a similar mechanism (at least at the
C“ resolution).

8 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Well-sampled conformational space is more useful with
organizational principles which can describe and characterize
it. Methods for extracting meaningful features and events must
cope with longer simulations of increasingly larger and more
complicated systems, and should eventually be used for validating
and error-checking MD simulations themselves. The trajectory
studied here samples many of the unique binding poses ubiquitin
must adopt for speciﬁc recognition of diverse ligands, providing
a rich platform for studying functionally relevant structural

transitions. However, ubiquitin’s structural shifts are subtle when
compared to those of hinge or multidomain proteins; that these
motions and connecting pathways are distinctly resolved with our
method speaks to the utility and suitability of higher-order statistics
for decomposing conformational space.

We exploited long-tail spatial distributions in former work
(QAA), and we extended it in this article with linear stochastic
models which account for temporal dependencies. This allows us
to explore speciﬁc, local dynamics accessible to a protein within
energetically homogeneous wells. Clustering to determine substates
was performed here within the 30-dimensional QAA subspace, and
we plan to compare our identiﬁed substates to those from other
clustering methods in the future. Additionally, increasingly subtle
or energetically local behaviors can be encoded by learning AR
models at successive clustering levels; how we couple AR-models
at potentially disparate hierarchical levels to give a coherent picture
of protein ﬂuctuations is a topic of future work. In addition, we
plan to apply maximum entropy methods to enable the dynamics
of even poorly-sampled energy wells to be incorporated into the
AR-model. While we demonstrated our framework on ubiquitin, we
have already used QAA on several other protein systems where we
expect QAARM to be useﬁil as well.

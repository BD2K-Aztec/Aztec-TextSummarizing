In silico site of metabolism prediction

 

where S,- is the slack variable that allows training errors, whereas CH and
C4 are penalty of misclassifying positive and negative samples, respect-
ively. Through those additional terms, SVM can handle non-linearly
separable training data. Besides, kernel function is applied to avoid the
dimensionality problems when constructing hyperplane in a high dimen-
sional space. Details of the theory can be found elsewhere (Burges, 1998;
Vapnik, 1999).

The SVM classiﬁer for each reaction type was established using the
LibSVM package (version 3.0) (Chang and Lin, 2001) with the radial
basis function (RBF) kernel [exp(-y||u-v||2]. To avoid skewing to predict-
ing majority class, a larger penalty is applied when misclassifying samples
from minority class. In the package of LibSVM, the penalty of class i is
calculated as C: W,-*C, where Wi is the weighting parameter. Here the
weight of the majority class was set to be 1, and the weight of the minority
class was determined according to the following relationship:

W+1 NEG

W,1 2 P05 (3)

 

where POS and NEG is the number of reactive and non-reactive sites,
respectively. Finally, parameters C and y were optimized simultaneously
during genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection as described in the
next section.

2.4 Feature selection and parameter optimization

Overﬁtting often occurs when a model uses more terms than necessary
(Hawkins, 2004). Because the degree of degeneracy of our deﬁned
descriptors can be high, models built using all of them could be easily
overﬁtting. Therefore, it is important to select a subset of relevant and
non-redundant features. Up until now, there are a couple of frequently
used feature selection techniques (Gonzalez et al., 2008), such as forward
and backward stepwise, GA, replacement method and so forth.

In the present study, for each pair of highly correlated features
(Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r2209), the one with smaller F-score
was removed ﬁrst. The F-score of j—th descriptor is deﬁned as follows
(Guyon et al., 2002):

ﬁ —2 T1 —2
(X,- —XJ-)+(X,- —X,-)

7 2 — 2
1 +1 +1 1 71 71
"+171;(Xk.j_ij ) +n,lil;(Xk.j_X} )

 

F]- : (4)

 

 

where, X111, Xka are the average values of j—th descriptor of positive,
negative and the overall samples, respectively; n+1, n,, are the number of
positive and negative samples; X;;,X,:}. are the k-th value of the j—th
descriptor of positive and negative samples, respectively. Feature with a
larger F-score was supposed to contribute more to the followed classiﬁ-
cation modeling.

Then, the framework of GA-based feature selection strategy as
described previously (Wang et al., 2010) was applied to select the descrip-
tors and optimize the SVM parameters (i.e. C, y) simultaneously. The
ﬁtness function of GA was deﬁned as

Fitness 2 BACC“. — weight >x< NM!) (5)

where BACC”, is the balanced accuracy (deﬁned in the next section) of
10-fold CV, Ndmp is the number of selected descriptors to build SVM
model and weight controls the number of selected descriptors. Different
weight values were tested, and it was set to 0.0015 due to the associated
BACC”, being consistently higher during the GA evolution.

2.5 Model performance

Given the quantities of true positive (TP), false negative (FN), true nega-
tive (TN) and false positive (FP), a classifier can usually be estimated by
sensitivity [SE = TP/(TP + FN)], speciﬁcity [SP 2 TN/(TN + FP)] and
accuracy [ACC 2 (TP + TN)/(TP + FN + TN + FP)]. SE is the measure

of the rate correctly identifying a site as reactive given it is truly glucur-
onidated; SP, in contrast, is the measure of the rate correctly identifying a
site as non-reactive given it is non-glucuronidated. Accuracy is the widely
used measure of overall classiﬁcation performance, but it is not appro-
priate when the dataset is imbalanced. Considering that the ratios of
reactive to non-reactive sites for different reaction types varies from
0.25 to 3.19, three alternative metrics, balanced accuracy
[BACC =(SE + SP)/2] (Lemnaru and Potolea, 2012), area under receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) (Fawcett, 2006) and Matthews cor-
relation coefﬁcient (MCC) (Matthews et al., 1975), were used to evaluate
the performance of obtained models.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Overview of glucuronidation sites

To model the sites of glucuronidation, dataset containing four
types of functional groups were collected and listed in Table 2.
When looking at the fraction of SOMs of each functional group,
we can see that the ability of glucuronidation varies over differ—
ent atom species. In general, oxygen atoms have more tendency
to be glucuronidated over nitrogen atoms, whereas the local
structure of oxygen atoms can also affect the reaction. As
shown in Table 2, both ArOH and COOH have much more
reactive sites than non—reactive ones, whereas AIOH has nearly
same number of reactive and non—reactive sites. As shown in
previous study (Kerdpin et al., 2009; Magdalou et al., 2010),
deprotonation of the substrate is one of the key steps during
O—glucuronidation. Thus the observed different reactive SOM
ratios could be partially explained by the deprotonation ability
of different reaction types. If other substituent effects are neg—
lected, the alkyl group of AIOH has electron donating effect,
which increases the electron density of O—H bond. On the con—
trary, the electron density of O—H bond of ArOH and C 00H is
lower due to the withdrawing effect of the corresponding groups.
Accordingly, the interaction between oxygen and hydrogen of
AIOH could be in general stronger than that of ArOH and
COOH, leading to less deprotonated oxygens and reactive
sites. Therefore, the reactivity of a given atom could be altered
by the local environment, and descriptors characterizing such
inﬂuence were supposed to be a discriminating predictor. For
example, of the calculated descriptors, Mulliken (1955) bond
order, also known as Mulliken’s overlap population, can char—
acterize the accumulation of the electrons between two bonded
atoms, and thus measures the strength of covalent bonding.
Wilcoxon rank—sum test showed that B_0H (Mulliken bond
order of O—H bond) of AIOH is on average greater than that
of ArOH and COOH (both P—values are <0.001).

3.2 Validation of classifiers

A combination of selected descriptors and SVM parameters with
the highest GA ﬁtness score were used to model the ﬁnal classi—
ﬁers for each kind of glucuronidation reaction type. As being
part of the fitness function of GA, BACC of 10—fold CV of each
model was optimized during feature selection. After thousands of
generations, the ﬁnal result of 10—fold CV was listed in Table 3,
from which one can see that a well and balanced performance
can be obtained after GA—based feature selection. The statistics
of each model on test set was also listed in Table 3. The results
indicate that our classiﬁers have generally high performance of

sites are not experimentally eminent. Because the current models
cannot compare the priority of different sites within or across
reactions, they do not match all of the experimentally observed
SOMs. In addition, the current study only used the local reactiv—
ity descriptors and the overall physicalwhemical properties,
whereas there are other factors that should be modeled. For
example, the local steric effect of ligand may hinder the nucleo—
philic attack of reaction site on the cofactor. Therefore, further
improvement should focus on the reaction kinetic issue and
try to take more factors related to the metabolism into
consideration.

5 CONCLUSON

In the present work, we developed four in silico models to predict
human UGT—catalyzed SOMs for the following potential sites:
aliphatic hydroxyl, aromatic hydroxyl, carboxyl group, aliphatic/
aromatic amino nitrogen and heterocyclic nitrogen. Extensive
validations were carried out on the models, and the results
demonstrated good predicting performances on both internal
and external tests. Among the GA—selected descriptors, we
found that local descriptors such as bond strength (between re—
active site and its neighbor) and Fukui atomic reactivity indices
are important to characterize the glucuronidation potential of a
site. Moreover, the distribution analysis of global descriptors
suggested that molecules with higher lipophilicity and relatively
small molecular size are generally more liable to glucuronidation.
Overall, the current study may provide insight for understanding
human phase II metabolic proﬁle of a chemical, and the resulted
in silico models allow chemists to make rational decisions more
quickly during pharmacokinetic lead optimization.

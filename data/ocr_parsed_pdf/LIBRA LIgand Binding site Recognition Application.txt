Abstract

Motivation: In recent years, structural genomics and ab initio molecular modeling activities are
leading to the availability of a large number of structural models of proteins whose biochemical
function is not known. The aim of this study was the development of a novel software tool that,
given a protein’s structural model, predicts the presence and identity of active sites and/0r ligand
binding sites.

Results: The algorithm implemented by ligand binding site recognition application (LIBRA) is based
on a graph theory approach to find the largest subset of similar residues between an input protein
and a collection of known functional sites. The algorithm makes use of two predefined databases
for active sites and ligand binding sites, respectively, derived from the Catalytic Site Atlas and the
Protein Data Bank. Tests indicate that LIBRA is able to identify the correct binding/active site in 90%
ofthe cases analyzed, 90% ofwhich feature the identified site as ranking first. As far as ligand bind—
ing site recognition is concerned, LIBRA outperforms other structure—based ligand binding sites de—
tection tools with which it has been compared.

Availability and implementation: The application, developed in Java SE 7 with a Swing GUI
embedding a JMoI applet, can be run on any OS equipped with a suitable Java Virtual Machine
(JVM), and is available at the following URL: http://www.computati0nalbiology.it/software/

1 Introduction

 

An important area of investigation in structural biology related to
protein function recognition is the identification of ligand binding
sites on the surface of proteins. This has a number of different appli-
cations ranging from function identification to drug discovery
(Petrey et (11., 2015). Current tools, implemented in software appli-
cations like eF-Seek (Murakami et (11., 2013), G-LoSA (Lee and 1m,
2013) and APoc (Gao and Skolnick, 2013), predict putative binding
sites of a given input protein by comparing the properties of its

surface patches with those of known binding sites. In addition,
web applications such as ProFunc provide similar predictions
based on a combination of sequence and structural information
(Laskowski et (11., 20053, b). In this study, LIBRA, a novel applica-
tion employing a graph theory approach for function recognition
and ligand binding sites detection, is described. LIBRA is based on
the comparison of an input protein structure with a database of
ligand binding sites extracted from PDB (Berman et (11., 2000).
Besides, the application has been also designed to overcome some

of the weak points evidenced in the function prediction software
ASSIST (Caprari et al., 2014) previously developed in our lab. In
fact, LIBRA can be used for the prediction of the catalytic activity
as well in conjunction with a database derived from the CSA
(Furnham et al., 2014). Extensive tests against the LigaSite
(Dessailly et al., 2008) non—redundant database (381 apo—proteins)
indicate that LIBRA is able to identify the correct binding/active
site in 90% of the cases analyzed. Furthermore, comparative tests
on a set of 30 apo—proteins extracted from LigASite demonstrate
that LIBRA is able to recognize the correct function/ligand in all of
the cases analyzed, outperforming other applications such as eF—
Seek and SiteSeer, the functional site identification service imple—
mented in ProFunc (Laskowski et al., 2005a,b).

2 Methodology

2.1 Generation of the databases

Given an input protein P, LIBRA detects the largest subsets of simi—
lar residues between P and not only known functional sites, but also
their local environment. As far as active site prediction is concerned,
this approach required the construction of a database of known pro—
tein active site templates, starting from the CSA entries (Furnham
et al., 2014). For the prediction of ligand binding sites, a database
has also been generated by extracting residues surrounding the lig—
and from 75 460 structures of protein—ligand complexes deposited
in PDB (as of June 2015). The final database contains 173 240 lig—
and binding sites in PDB format. A detailed description of the pro—
cedure used to build the two databases is given in the Supplementary
Materials.

2.2 Implementation of LIBRA

The similarity between a subset of residues belonging to an input
protein and a binding site with its neighboring residues is defined in
LIBRA by a graph (Biggs et al., 1986) formed by nodes and edges
whose definitions are given as follows: a residue R1, belonging to
the input protein, and a residue R2, belonging to a known protein,
form a node if they are identical or equivalent, according to a resi—
dues equivalence table (see Supplementary Table 51). If Node A is
formed by the residues pair (A1, A2), Node B by the residues pair
(B1, 32), d1 is distance(A1,B1), d2 is distance(A2,Bz) and 6:error
distance threshold, there is an edge which connects A and B if
)d1 — d2) < 5. Once the relationships between the input protein and
the known binding site (and neighboring residues) are defined as a
graph, a subset of equivalent residues is then defined as a clique
(a subset of nodes such that every two nodes in the subset are con—
nected by an edge), and the largest subset of equivalent residues is
defined as the maximum clique. The advantage of this approach is
that the similarity between the ligand environment of the template
and the input protein is well described as a graph, and as such it is
possible to implement an exact algorithm to find the maximum cli—
que within it. As a matter of fact, LIBRA employs an exact algo—
rithm for solving the problem of maximum clique detection
(Carraghan and Pardalos, 1990) and incorporates novel pruning
techniques based on the biological context. A more detailed tech—
nical implementation of the algorithm is presented in the
Supplementary Materials.

2.3 LIBRA's input/output

In LIBRA’s input window, the user can select the database to be used
and set a series of parameters for the execution of the program, such
as: the minimum percentage of similar residues between the input

protein site and the known site, the minimum size of the similar site,
the maximum rmsd value of the alignments, etc. For the detection of
ligand binding sites, the user can also choose to eliminate from the
final output all the alignments in which the residues of the input pro—
tein clash with the rototranslated ligand. LIBRA’s input procedure is
described in detail in the Supplementary Materials. LIBRA’s results
are displayed to the user in the output window, in the form of an inter—
active table. For each of the alignments the user is given the possibility
of displaying three—dimensional representations of the alignment via
the embedded JMol program (Hanson, 2010). Lastly, an info button
provides information regarding the known protein (and ligand in the
case of binding sites) and links to the relevant PubMed and Protein
Data Bank web pages. The alignments displayed in the output win—
dow can be sorted by different criteria, including holo protein
name, ligand ID, known site size, percentage of conservation, clique
size and rmsd. Further details are given in the Supplementary
Materials.

3 Results

3.1 Tests on catalytic sites and binding sites recognition
LIBRA’s effectiveness in the prediction of ligand binding sites and
of ligand identity has been extensively tested via two sets of apo—
proteins from the LigASite database (Dessailly et al., 2008). This
database is a collection of proteins for which three—dimensional
structures are available both in the apo, ligand—free form and in the
holo form. The first test set, whose results can be found in
Supplementary Table 52, included 381 apo—proteins and showed
that LIBRA identified the correct binding site in 349 cases (91.6%),
332 (95%) of which featured the identified site as ranking first. The
second test set, used for comparative purposes and whose results are
reported in Supplementary Table S4, included 30 randomly—chosen
apo—proteins and demonstrated that LIBRA was able to recognize
the correct function/ligand in all of the cases analyzed. Interestingly
enough, the correct ligand binding site was detected also when the
corresponding hit was represented by a known protein displaying an
amino acid sequence identity with the input protein as low as 18%.
Two other applications for protein function/ligand binding sites pre—
diction were tested against this same test set, i.e. eF—Seek and
SiteSeer. Results indicate that LIBRA performed better than
SiteSeer, the latter failing to find a solution in three cases out of 30,
while it significantly outperformed eF—Seek, which did not return
any significant results for ~30% of the cases. Besides, LIBRA has
also been tested on the same test set used for the validation of
ASSIST (Supplementary Table SS). Here, the correct active site was
detected in 45 cases (83%), 39 (86.7%) of which ranking
first, showing a significantly higher accuracy in comparison with
ASSIST and a higher number of cases where the correct result
ranked first.

3.2 System performance

LIBRA is a stand—alone software application, whose execution time
may depend on the capabilities of the machine running it. On an
I72860QM with 32—GB RAM, an Intel SSD 520 and a 64—bit OS
and JVM, average running times of 25 min have been detected. This
appears more than acceptable given the number of entries that make
up the ligand binding sites database. When using LIBRA for the rec—
ognition of active sites with the much smaller catalytic sites database
(1000 entries), the running time is always lower than 1 min. It is im—
portant to stress out that, in order to achieve these levels of perform—
ance, LIBRA takes advantage of a multi—threading algorithm.

4 Discussion

In this article, LIBRA, a software tool for ligand binding/active sites
recognition, has been described. Regarding ligand binding sites
detection, tests on the entire LigaSite non—redundant database
(381 apo—proteins) demonstrate that LIBRA correctly predicts the
binding site/ligand identity in 90% of the cases. Besides, on a
smaller, randomly chosen, subset of LigaSite, LIBRA outperforms
both SiteSeer and Ef—Seek. As far as active sites detection is con—
cerned, LIBRA showed a significant improvement over ASSIST
(Caprari et al., 2014), which in turn had shown to yield results com—
parable to SiteSeer’s. Most importantly, in LIBRA the correct pre—
diction ranks first in more than 70% of the cases, as opposed to
60% in ASSIST. Finally, a web application fully interoperable with
the stand—alone program and packed with additional features is cur—
rently under development and will be announced soon.

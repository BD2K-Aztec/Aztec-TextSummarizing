Abstract

Motivation: The challenges of successfully applying causal inference methods include: (i) satisfy—
ing underlying assumptions, (ii) limitations in data/models accommodated by the software and
(iii) low power of common multiple testing approaches.

Results: The causal inference test (CIT) is based on hypothesis testing rather than estimation,
allowing the testable assumptions to be evaluated in the determination of statistical significance. A
user—friendly software package provides P—values and optionally permutation—based FDR estimates
(q—values) for potential mediators. It can handle single and multiple binary and continuous instru—
mental variables, binary or continuous outcome variables and adjustment covariates. Also, the per—
mutation—based FDR option provides a non—parametric implementation.

Conclusion: Simulation studies demonstrate the validity of the cit package and show a substantial
advantage of permutation—based FDR over other common multiple testing strategies.

Availability and implementation: The cit open—source R package is freely available from the CRAN
website (https://cran.r—project.org/web/packages/cit/index.html) with embedded C ++ code that util—

1 Introduction

The causal inference test (CIT) (Millstein et (11., 2009), can play an
important role in ‘post GWAS’ analyses that seek to identify molecu-
lar mediators of the effects of genetic variation on disease pheno-
types. A growing number of groups have used the CIT to identify
mediators such as niethylation (Hong et (11., 2015; Liu et (11., 2013;
Yuan et (11., 2014) and gene expression (Hong et (11., 2015; Liu et (11.,
2013; Millstein et (11., 2011; Tang et (11., 2014).

The previously published CIT function was limited in scope, accom-
modating a single discrete SNP-like variable, a continuous mediator and
a continuous outcome. We have developed the ‘cit’ R package to extend
software capabilities in a number of important ways: (i) binary as well
as continuous outcomes, (ii) continuous as well as binary instrumental
variables, (iii) multiple instrumental variables simultaneously and (iv) an
approach for generating permutation-based q-values (the false discovery
rate (FDR) analog to P-values) with confidence intervals.

2 Implementation

The CIT simultaneously evaluates multiple conditions known to be
consistent with causal mediation (Millstein et (11., 2009). Consider a
locus (L), a gene expression feature (G) as a potential mediator of
an effect of L on T, and a disease trait (T), then the conditions are:
(i) L is associated with T, (ii) L is associated with G conditional on
T, (iii) T is associated with G conditional on L and (iv) T is inde-
pendent of L conditional on G. A P-value is computed for each con-
dition using a general linear modeling framework, and the
maximum P-value is interpreted as an omnibus hypothesis test (the
CIT) for the intersection of the component rejection regions, an
‘intersection/union test’ (IUT). The omnibus null hypothesis is that
at least one component null hypothesis is true.

In genomic settings where thousands of mediation tests may be
performed, a separate test would be conducted for each (L,G,T) set,
and a multiple testing approach applied for the family of tests. FDR

makes sense as a multiple testing strategy due to its sensitivity, which
increases as the number of false null hypotheses increase. Thus, even
though tests are conducted independently, there is still information
exchange across tests. In contrast, the Bonferroni approach is much
more conservative, with each test independent of other tests.
However, achieving adequate power is a challenge even with an FDR
approach. We have implemented the Millstein and Volfson FDR ap—
proach (Millstein and Volfson, 2013), which is permutation—based
thus non—parametric, and less conservative than the popular
Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) approach. For a given mediation test,
the q—value can be thought of as representing the probability of a false
discovery at a significance threshold defined by the P—value, therefore
an FDR analogue to the IUT could be constructed as, P[any compo—
nent test is a false discovery] : 1 — P[all component tests are true dis—
COVelfieSI:1 — (1 — ‘11) I (1 — 112) I (1 — 1I3) I (1 — 114), Where ‘1;
represents the q—value for the jth component test. Note that this ex—
pression is related to the conventional IUT in that it is greater than or
equal to the maximum of the component test q—values. The enhanced
cit software has implemented this concept with the permutation—based
FDR approach, which is computationally efficient because relatively
few permutations are required (Millstein and Volfson, 2013).
Although the approach is nonparametric, the assumption of ex—
changeability must be considered when conducting any permutation
test. (See supplemental material for discussion of exchangeability and
computational efficiency.)

3 Results

In simulated data, we compared the permutation—based FDR ap—
proach implemented in the new software as described above to its
parametric equivalent as described by Millstein and Volfson (2013)
(Supplemental Eq. 52), computed on the omnibus CIT P—values. 2000
replicate datasets were simulated for each scenario, binary versus con—
tinuous outcome, and multiple testing corrections were based on the
corresponding 2000 P—values. Because parametric assumptions were
satisfied in the simulated data, and the theory behind both FDR esti—
mators is the same, we would expect close agreement between the
two approaches. Very close agreement was observed (Fig. 1), which
demonstrates the validity of the permutation—based IUT approach.
Also apparent in the results is the substantial gain in power of the
Millstein and Volfson FDR approach over the Bonferroni and BH
methods, which is consistent with theoretical properties of the respect—
ive tests (Millstein and Volfson, 2013). The unadjusted P—value curve
for simulations conducted under reverse causality shows that fewer
tests are called significant than would be expected under the null.
Thus, the results demonstrate the robustness of the method to reverse
causality confusion, and that the test is actually conservative under
these conditions. Other simulation results also demonstrated similar
properties when multiple instrumental variables with and without
statistical interactions were involved (Supplemental Figs 51 and 52).

4 Conclusion

The cit package provides a general and powerful tool for identifying
the most likely molecular mediators of genetic effects. The permuta—
tion—based q—value method makes the CIT fully non—parametric. The
ability to apply a permutation based FDR approach with confidence
intervals has the potential to substantially increase the utility of the
method by uncoupling statistical significance with the conventional .05
level. Results that do not achieve this threshold may nevertheless be

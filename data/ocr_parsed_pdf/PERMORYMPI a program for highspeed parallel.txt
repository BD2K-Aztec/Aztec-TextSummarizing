ABSTRACT

Summary: PERMORY is software for accelerated permutation
testing of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We have
parallelized PERMORY using the Message-Passing Interface
resulting in a nearly linear speedup. Furthermore, we added
accelerated analysis of GWAS using quantitative phenotypes, and
an accurate estimation of the effective number of independent tests.

1 INTRODUCTION

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) nowadays involves the
statistical analysis of millions of single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) markers. For the calculation of adjusted P-values for
genome-wide testing, the Bonferroni method is highly conservative,
because it ignores the correlation of markers caused by linkage
disequilibrium. In contrast, a permutation-based correction of
P-values fully accounts for this correlation and provides the highest
statistical power among the procedures controlling genome-wide
type I error risk. While conventional permutation algorithms often
required prohibitively long computation times for large datasets,
the PERMORY algorithm of Pahl and Schafer (2010) has made
permutation testing feasible for large-scale GWAS analysis. In time,
SNP chips with larger numbers of markers, such as Illumina®
Human Omni with 5 Mio SNPs are available, and the next-
generation sequencing techniques will open the way for ﬁill
sequence association studies adding another 10 or 20 million
of rare variants. We therefore have undertaken one step ﬁirther
and developed the ﬁrst freely available parallel algorithm for
permutation testing in GWAS. Based on the original PERMORY
algorithm, the computation process now can be spread to multiple
processors in a Cluster using MPI (Message Passing Interface Forum,
2009). In addition, we have ﬁirther developed the original algorithm,
being restricted to the analysis of dichotomous phenotypes, now to
handle quantitative phenotypes as well. Moreover, for each dataset,
PERMORY now also provides an accurate estimate of the effective
number of independent tests (Cheverud, 2001).

2 DESCRIPTION OF PERMORY-MPI

PERMORY-MP11 is an open source program written in C++ using
the C++ library Boost MPI. It can be run on every computer Cluster
where an MP1 implementation is installed, for example Open MP1
version 1.2.7 rc2 or higher (http://www.open-mpi.org/). The data
ﬁles must be available at the speciﬁed path on each node PERMORY-
MPI should run at. A network ﬁle system is useﬁil in this situation.
If a network ﬁle system is not available, or the throughput of the
network ﬁle system is insufﬁcient, the data ﬁles have to be copied
to each node before submitting the job to the MPI Cluster.

The program supports various input data formats (PLINK, Purcell
et a1. 2007; PRESTO, Browning 2008; SLIDE, Han et al. 2009).
The format is detected automatically. Files of different formats
can be used in combination. Marker genotypes may be coded as
0, 1 and 2 for the copy number of a speciﬁc allele, or in allelic
representation as ‘AC’ and ‘GT’. Phenotypic values can be real
numbers coding for quantitative traits, or 0/1 or 1/2 coding for
unaffected/affected, respectively. The type of trait, quantitative or
dichotomous, is determined automatically by the software.

Regarding dichotomous traits, PERMORY is using Cochran—
Armitage’s trend test, where, for each marker, a test statistic is
derived from the contingency table that contains the genotype
frequencies for cases and controls (Pahl and Schafer, 2010). The
handling of quantitative traits is a novel feature, which requires
a different type of statistic. PERMORY-MP1 uses the test statistic
deﬁned by Lin (2006)

where Yl- is the phenotypic value of the i-th subject, in is the
genotype score for the j-th marker of the i-th subject, and My
and [,Lj are the population means of Yl- and in. To maintain
the computational speed of the original algorithm, the two most
important acceleration methods, genotype indexing with transposed
permutations and reconstruction memoization (Pahl and Schafer
2010), were ﬁlrther developed to be applicable to the above statistic
(SteiB, 2011).

For the mentioned statistics the asymptotic distributions are
known so that a raw P-value, say pj, can be derived for each
of the j = 1,...,M markers. To correct pj for the multiplicity of
tested hypotheses, the distribution under the null of no marker being

of the software.

associated with the trait is simulated by perrnuting the phenotype
values (or trait labels). In particular, the genome-wide adjusted
P-value for marker j is calculated using a single step max-t procedure
(Westfall and Young, 1993). Assuming a set of, say, r permutations,
k: 1, ...,r, of the phenotype vector, we set

pf: <1+# of k’s for which Tﬁlax >  /(r+ 1)

where  is the value of the test statistic for marker j in the original

sample, and Tﬁlax is the maximal test statistic over all markers under
the k-th permutation. With a number of P available processors,
PERMORY-MPI delegates the calculation of r /P maximal values
Tﬁlax to each processor. These values are then merged on the
central process, where the adjusted P-values are calculated. The
ﬁnal output consists of a sorted list of a user-speciﬁed number
of top markers, providing two-sided raw (i.e., unadjusted) and
genome-wide adjusted P-values for every marker.

Permutation tests are considered the gold standard for multiple
testing correction in GWAS. One important alternative approach is to
estimate the effective number of independent tests Meff (Cheverud,
2001) for a set of M markers, and use this number for an improved
Bonferroni correction: p; :11]. ‘Meff. The more accurate Meff can be
estimated, the more precise will be the P-value adjustment. Since
by simple algebra Meff =1);< /pj, the adjusted P-value obtained from
the permutation test yields a direct estimate of Meff. PERMORY-
MPI now calculates Meff for the top marker, which, assuming a
sufﬁcient number of permutations, provides a more accurate estimate
than available ‘indirect’ approaches (e. g. Cheverud 2001; Gao et al.
2008; Li and Ji 2005).

Any method or test realizable by the presented permutation
approach can be incorporated into the software. The implementation
of additional methods is supported by the object oriented software
design of PERMORY. In particular, stratiﬁed testing and the
inclusion of covariates are planned to be implemented in a next
version.

3 RESULTS

We investigated the runtime behavior of PERMORY-MPI using
genotype data from the WTCCC2 study (The Wellcome Trust
Case Control Consortium, 2007) with 1115428 SNPs in 5667
individuals, randomly divided into 2834 cases and 2833 controls.
The benchmarks resulted in a nearly linear speedup (Fig. 1).
A conservative extrapolation of the results of Pahl and Schafer
(2010) would result in runtimes of more than 250h with
PRESTO and of more than 15 000h with PLINK for the
present dataset. We also compared PLINK and PERMORY for
quantitative phenotypes, using the genotype data of the WTCCC2
study in Chromosome 22 with 18649 SNPs combined with
randomly generated quantitative phenotypes following a Gaussian
distribution. With 10000 permutations, runtimes were 0.27h with
single process PERMORY, and 0.04h using 10 parallel processes,
as compared to 52.38 h with PLINK.

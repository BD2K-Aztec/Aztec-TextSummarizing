required. However, we expect this more precise deﬁnition of
functional SNP sets will allow a sharp increase in the power of
variant set enrichment analyses, and this will allow VSEAMS
analyses to interpret functionally deﬁned genetic regions by link—
ing them to end—point phenotypes.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The authors thank John Todd for his help in conceiving the
study, interpreting the results and comments on the manuscript.
The authors thank Vin Everett and Wojciech Giel for computing
support, as well as other members of the Diabetes and
Inﬂammation Laboratory for assistance throughout. The au—
thors acknowledge Darren Cusanovich for facilitating early
access to knockdown experimental data.

This study uses resources provided by the Type 1 Diabetes
Genetics Consortium, a collaborative clinical study sponsored
by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, National Human Genome Research Institute,
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
and JDRF and supported by (U01 DK062418). This study
makes use of data generated by the Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium. A full list of the investigators who contrib—
uted to the generation of the data is available from http://www.
wtccc.org.uk/. Funding for the project was provided by the
Wellcome Trust under award (076113). The authors acknow—
ledge the National Institute of Mental Health for Control sub—
jects from the National Institute of Mental Health Schizophrenia
Genetics Initiative (NIMH—GI), data and biomaterials are being
collected by the ‘Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia II’ collab—
oration. The investigators and co—investigators are as follows:
P.V. Gejman (Collaboration coordinator) and AR. Sanders

Louis, U01 (MH060879)]; R. Crowe (PI) and D. Black
[University of Iowa (MH59566)]; R. Freedman [University of
Colorado (MH059565)]; D. Levinson [University
of Pennsylvania (MH061675)]; B. Mowry [University of
Queensland (MH059588)]; and J. Silverman [Mt. Sinai School
of Medicine (MH59586)]. The samples were collected by V.L.
Nimgaonkar’s group at the University of Pittsburgh as part of
a multi—institutional collaborative research project with J.
Smoller and P. Sklar (Massachusetts General Hospital (MH
63420).The authors gratefully acknowledge the Genetics of
Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) study obtained from the

ABSTRACT

Summary: The R/Bioconductor package RamiGO is an R interface to
AmiGO that enables visualization of Gene Ontology (GO) trees. Given
a list of GO terms, RamiGO uses the AmiGO visualize API to import
Graphviz-DOT format files into R, and export these either as images
(SVG, PNG) or into Cytoscape for extended network analyses.
RamiGO provides easy customization of annotation, highlighting of
specific GO terms, colouring of terms by P—value or export of a sim-
plified summary GO tree. We illustrate RamiGO functionalities in a
genome-wide gene set analysis of prognostic genes in breast cancer.
Availability and implementation: RamiGO is provided in R/Biocon-
ductor, is open source under the Artistic-2.0 License and is available
with a user manual containing installation, operating instructions and
tutorials. It requires R version 2.15.0 or higher. URL: http://bioconduc
tor.org/packages/release/bioc/htmI/RamiGO.html

1 INTRODUCTION

The Gene Ontology (G0) is a controlled vocabulary of gene
annotation that was developed to provide consistent functional
classiﬁcation for genes across species; G0 is also widely used in
gene set enrichment analyses (Gene Ontology Consortium,
2012). It is organized as a directed acyclic graph with top-level
ontologies molecular function, biological process and cellular
component. Although several web-based or standalone tools
are available for Visualization of lists of GO terms as GO tree
structures, these are not easily accessible through R/Bioconduc—
tor, where one has to either rebuild the GO tree using R packages
such as GO.db or GOstats, or copy and paste the GO terms of
interest into an external web service such as AmiGO Visualize

(Carbon et al., 2009, http://amigo.geneontology.org) to display
the GO tree.

The free open source web application AmiGO provides users
with access to ontology and gene annotation data. Visualization
of the queried ontology data is provided by AmiGO Visualize,
which uses Graphviz libraries to create GO trees. Graphviz is a
collection of software for Viewing and manipulating abstract
graphs (Gansner and North, 2000). We developed RamiGO to
provide R functions that connect directly with the AmiGO
Visualize API and retrieve GO trees in various formats. The
most common format being PNG or SVG image ﬁle, but a file
representation of the GO tree in the Graphviz-DOT format is
also possible. RamiGO provides a parser for the Graphviz-DOT
format that returns an R S4 object, called AmigoDot, that in-
cludes (i) the tree as a graph object, (ii) the adjacency matrix of
the tree, (iii) the annotation of the nodes, (iv) the relation be-
tween the nodes and (V) a list of the leaves of the tree. The G0
tree is displayed with the set of input GO IDs and all parents of
those GO IDs to the root of each GO category where relations
between the nodes are represented using the same colour palette
as AmiGO Visualize; green, red, black, blue and light blue rep-
resent ‘positively regulates’, ‘negatively regulates’, ‘regulates’, ‘is
a’ and ‘part of , respectively. In addition using RamiGO, one can
display and interactively modify GO tree colours, annotations
and relationships between nodes in Cytoscape directly from R.

2 USING THE RAMIGO PACKAGE

The main functions within the RamiGO package are as follows:

getAmigoTree (goIDs , color , filename , picType)
readAmigoDot (object , filename)
AmigoDot . to . Cyto (object)

which retrieve a G0 tree from AmiGO Visualize in the preferred
format type, read Graphviz-DOT format ﬁles and communicate
with Cytoscape, respectively. The AmigoDot.to.Cyto() function
displays the tree from an AmigoDot object in Cytoscape using
the RCytoscape package. RCytoscape requires the Cytoscape
plugin CytoscapeRPC, and the installation of this is described

convert the AmigoDot S4 objects to graphAM and grathEL
formats are also provided (AmigoDot.to.graphAM,
AmigoDot.to.grathEL).

3 AN EXAMPLE

To showcase an analysis pipeline (Supplementary Material) that
integrates the RamiGO package, we used the Bioconductor data
package breastCancerVDX, which includes Affymetrix Human
U133A microarray profiles from 344 breast cancer patients
(Wang et al., 2005; Minn et al., 2007). We ranked the genes
based on their prognostic value by computing the concordance
index to estimate the association of each gene with distant
metastasis-free survival using the package survcomp (Schroder
et al., 2011). This ranked list was then used to run a pre-ranked
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al.,

2005), using the C5 (GO) subset of the Molecular Signature
Database (V3.0) gene sets (http://broadinstitute.org/gsea/
msigdb/collections.jsp). Figure 1 shows a subset of the GO cel-
lular component gene sets that were reported with a false discov-
ery rate <0.15. Using the customized colouring option in
RamiGO, the nodes for gene sets with a positive Normalized
Enrichment Score (NES) are red and nodes for gene sets with
a negative NES are blue. The clustering of red and blue nodes is
clearly Visible and would have been missed when only looking at
the GO gene set terms alone.

Figure 1 shows the PNG image ﬁle of the tree from AmiGO
Visualize. By changing the picType parameter of the
getAmigoTree() function, we can also specify SVG and DOT
for the requested ﬁle type or it can be Viewed in Cytoscape by
exporting AmigoDot object using AmigoDot.to.Cyto (Fig. 2).

4 CONCLUSION

The R/Bioconductor package RamiGO provides an easy-to-use
R interface to the AmiGO Visualize web server. It provides a
simple and elegant way to retrieve Graphviz trees that display
hundreds of GO IDs at once and efﬁciently study clusters or
subcomponents of the GO tree in graph form. RamiGO provides
functions to convert a G0 tree into different formats and display it
in Cytoscape without leaving the R environment. RamiGO is
therefore a perfect companion to GSEA and GO analyses in R,
as it helps one better analyse and interpret the long, and some-
times complex, lists of GO identiﬁers that these analyses produce.

essaMEM

 

a virtual sparse sufﬁx tree that is simulated by the SA and LCP arrays.
The sparsiﬁcation of the child array is possible because child array oper-
ations only require knowledge of intervals within LCP arrays, for which
the deﬁnition remains unchanged when introducing sparseness. The
second improvement is the introduction of a skip parameter s, which
introduces sparseness in the query sequence, resulting in a performance
trade-off between two stages of the algorithm. When optimized, this
parameter can lead to a signiﬁcant increase in performance.

The ﬁrst step in indexed MEM-ﬁnding algorithms consists of con-
structing an index structure for a reference sequence. For the construction
of the sparse child array, we used the algorithm described in the study
conducted by Abouelhoda et a]. (2004).

In a second phase, all sufﬁxes of a query sequence are matched against
the index structure until a mismatch occurs, or the user-set minimum
length L is reached. The output of this phase consists of all right maximal
matches of minimum length L — K + l. Khan et a]. combine a binary
search algorithm for matching characters and sufﬁx link support, which
recovers computations made for the previous sufﬁx, to increase the per-
formance of this phase. essaMEM uses a faster matching algorithm using
the sparse child array. Although sufﬁx links can still be used with this
approach, the combination of a sparse child array and sufﬁx links does
not lead to further improvements in execution time for the MEM-ﬁnding
algorithm. Tests have shown that the use of the skip parameter has the
same functionality as sufﬁx link support, but it has a higher impact on
the mapping time and affects a broader range of sparseness factors.
The combination of child arrays and sufﬁx links might, however, still
be of interest for designing other algorithms.

The ﬁnal step of the MEM-ﬁnding algorithm requires checking all
right maximal matches for left maximality. As this phase is usually
faster than the previous matching phase, essaMEM introduces a trade-off
parameter s to increase the input of this phase and decrease the number of
sufﬁxes matched in the previous phase by a factor 3. As a result, the
matching phase generates all right maximal matches of minimum
length L—s-K+ l.

3 RESULTS

essaMEM is open source and can be used as drop—in replacement
for tools that require MEM—ﬁnding. In particular, essaMEM
supports all MUMmer v3.23 options. We evaluated the perform—
ance of essaMEM against sparseMEM, M UMmer, Vmatch and
backwardMEM using all relevant datasets provided previously
(Khan et al., 2009). The default setting of essaMEM features a
sparse child array and an estimate for the optimized skip param—
eter, but lacks sufﬁx links support. Because the sparse child array
has the same size as the inverse sufﬁx array (only required for
sufﬁx link support), essaMEM has the same memory footprint as
the index structure used by Khan et a]. For optimizing s, the
runtime for a maximum of five successive values of s is taken.
The largest value of s is set to be the largest value for which
L — s - K+ 1 3 10. Timing results do not include the index con—
struction phase, and the resident set size was measured to deter—
mine the memory footprint of the programs. The program
parameters are the same as used in the study conducted by
Khan et a]. (2009) and Ohlebusch et a]. (2010). However, we
explore a much larger interval of sparseness and compression
factors than previously reported by other authors.

All MEM—ﬁnding algorithms are tested on six pairs of
megabase—sized genomes and two sequencing read datasets.
SparseMEM and essaMEM are also tested on two pairs of
gigabase—sized sequences. Figure 1 depicts the memory—time
trade—offs presented by the different algorithms for finding all

Fig. 1. Scatterplot showing the memory-time trade-offs for ﬁnding all
MEMs of minimum length 50 between D.melan0gaster (169 Mb) and
D. yakuba (166 Mb). The data points are acquired by setting the sparse-
ness/ compression factor K to the following values (from right to left): 1, 2,
4, 8, l6 and 32. There is only one data point for MUMmer and Vmatch

MEMs between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila
yakuba. The other results, which can be found in the
Supplementary Material, depict a similar behaviour.

MUMmer and Vmatch have one of the lowest mapping times
among the tested programs. Their memory requirements are,
however, higher than those of the tools using compressed or
sparse index structures. Furthermore, they do not allow setting
a memory—time trade—off.

The tests show that sparseMEM is clearly outperformed by
essaMEM and backwardMEM. Although sparseMEM is fast
for small values of K, its performance steeply decreases when
K is increased, which can be explained by the diminishing use
of sufﬁx links. For the largest values of K, a decrease in the
runtime of the mapping phase has a positive effect on the overall
runtime of sparseMEM.

A similar decrease in runtime for the mapping phase can be
observed using the sparse child array in essaMEM. This is, how—
ever, countered by the diminishing effect of the skip parameter
and can, therefore, not be seen in Figure 1. The lower running
time for the mapping phase might be explained by a combination
of the use of a sparse child array that can match more than one
character at the same time, smaller minimum lengths in the
matching phase and improved I/O performance. When 5 is
increased, the runtime decreases manifold. This effect is, how—
ever, limited by the theoretical bound 5 - K g L. The effects of
the various improvements made to the original SSA—based design
are discussed in the Supplementary Material.

The results also indicate that essaMEM is in general somewhat
faster than backwardMEM for comparable memory settings.
The difference in runtime is larger when either memory is abun—
dant (low values of K), or the number of MEMs found is large,
as backwardMEM seems to have a stronger dependency on the
output size. This behaviour can be seen in Figure 1, where the
runtime of backwardMEM steeply increases for K > 8. In con—
trast to SSA—based methods, however, backwardMEM puts no
restriction on the maximum value of K and could thus be used
for small L settings in combination with a high compression
factor.

In terms of memory consumption, backwardMEM starts with
a lower memory footprint at no compression, but the memory
footprint of essaMEM decreases faster. Theoretically, the CSA

ESSA index requires 9/K + 1 bytes per input character. As a
result, both indexes theoretically have the same memory require—
ments for K B 13. The actual allocated memory for the sparse or
compressed index structures for the Dmelanogaster genome is

MEM—finding tools is equal for K between 4 and 8.

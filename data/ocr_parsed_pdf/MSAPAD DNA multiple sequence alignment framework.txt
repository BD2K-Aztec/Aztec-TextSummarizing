Abstract

Summary: Here we present the MSA—PAD application, a DNA multiple sequence alignment frame—
work that uses PFAM protein domain information to align DNA sequences encoding either single
or multiple protein domains. MSA—PAD has two alignment options: gene and genome mode.

Availability and Implementation: MSA—PAD is available as a web application (https://recasgate
way.ba.infn.it/) and as two Taverna workflows corresponding to two alignment modes (Gene
mode: http://www.myexperiment.0rg/w0rkflows/4549.html; Genome Mode: http://www.myexperi

 

ment.0rg/w0rkflows/4551.html).

1 Introduction

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is one of the oldest problems in
bioinformatics and represents a key step in sequence analysis appli-
cations such as phylogenetic inference and comparative genomics.
Algorithms such as translatorX (Abascal et (11., 2010) and ti'aizrzliglz
(EMBOSS; Rice et (11., 2000), taking advantage of the higher conser-
vation of proteins than their respective coding sequences, use the
protein alignment to guide the reconstruction of accurate MSAs at
nucleotide level. However, these methods do not make use of infor-
mation embedded in protein domains. Moreover, when applied to
genomic sequences, such approaches account neither for intron oc-
currence nor for gene order variations (e.g. mitochondrial genomes;
D’Onorio de Meo et (11., 2012) resulting in apparently truncated
protein domains or variations in their arrangement along the gen-
ome regions under investigation.

Here we present a DNA MSA framework (MSA-PAD), which
conceptually translates DNA sequences into amino acids (based on
user-defined genetic code and reading frame/s), uses information

from conserved PFAM domains (Finn et (11., 2014) to assign the
translated sequences to known protein domains, accounts for
frameshifts when domain regions are split by introns, performs a
domain-based protein alignment and then uses protein alignment
information to generate the relevant nucleotide multiple alignment.
The final MSA can be generated following two different strategies:
(i) Gene and (ii) Genome mode. Gene mode alignment respects
domain order organization from 5’ to 3’, and resolves the alignment
of repetitive domains even when they are repeated in tandem.
Genome mode alignment provides a super-gene-like alignment
ignoring domain order constraints.

Abstract

Motivation: By collecting multiple samples per subject, researchers can characterize intra—subject
variation using physiologically relevant measurements such as gene expression profiling. This can
yield important insights into fundamental biological questions ranging from cell type identity to tu—
mour development. For each subject, the data measurements can be written as a matrix with the
different subsamples (e.g. multiple tissues) indexing the columns and the genes indexing the rows.
In this context, neither the genes nor the tissues are expected to be independent and straightfor—
ward application of traditional statistical methods that ignore this two—way dependence might lead
to erroneous conclusions. Herein, we present a suite of tools embedded within the R/Bioconductor
package HDTD for robustly estimating and performing hypothesis tests about the mean relation—
ship and the covariance structure within the rows and columns. We illustrate the utility of HDTD by
applying it to analyze data generated by the Genotype—Tissue Expression consortium.

1 Introduction

The term ‘transposable data’ refers to data that are naturally written
in a matrix whose dimensions correspond to two distinct features of
interest, while the term ‘high-dimensional’ reflects the fact that the
dimension of the subject-specific data matrix is larger than the num-
ber of subjects. High-dimensional transposable data can be found in
genetics, e.g. when, for each subject, gene expression levels are
measured in multiple tissues (Piccirillo et (11., 2015), in different
fragments of the same tumour (Sottoriva et (11., 2013) or in a well-
defined spatial order (Petretto et (11., 2010), in yeast expression stud-
ies (Smith and Kruglyak, 2008), in protein-signaling networks
(Sachs et (11., 2005), in eQTL analysis (Bhadra and Mallick, 2013)
and in other studies with EEG, fMRI and time-series data (cf.
Touloumis et (11., 2014). To analyze robustly such datasets,

we developed the R package HDTD (High-Dimensional
Transposable Data).

In multiple-tissue gene expression studies, the rows correspond to
genes and the columns to tissues, and genes and tissues might to be
correlated with each other. Ignoring a potential tissue-wise correlation
could be misleading in determining the strength of the gene-wise cor-
relation (Touloumis et (11., 2014) and it may hinder the discovery of
differentially expressed genes, since traditional ANOVA-type tests suf-
fer from extremely low power and/or false positive findings
(Touloumis et (11., 2015). The unique feature of HDTD is the imple-
mentation of sound statistical methods that account for and estimate
both the tissue- and gene-wise correlation, thus facilitating reliable in-
ference about the form of the mean gene expression levels and the
functional relationship among genes and/or tissues.

2 Statistical background

To introduce the notation, suppose that the gene expression levels
for subject 1' are recorded in an r X 6 matrix X, with rows the same
set of 1’ genes and columns the same set of c tissues. We assume that
X1, . . . ,XN are independently and identically distributed. Inference
about the mean relationship of the genes across the tissues and about
the dependence structure relies on estimating and/0r testing hypoth—
eses about the mean matrix M, the gene covariance matrix ER and
the tissue covariance matrix 2c. In particular, the (a, b) element of
M determines the mean expression level for gene a in tissue b, the
(c, d) element of ER the covariance of genes 6 and d, and the (e, f)
element of 2c the covariance of tissues e and f. The covariance struc—
ture between two elements of a typical X has a Kronecker product
form: Cov(X,-,-, le) : ER” Eel-m.

In practice it is often of interest to identify differentially ex—
pressed genes. For example, it is important to assess whether the
overall mean pattern of gene expression levels remains constant
across all or pre—specified tissue groups. To do this, HDTD imple—
ments the testing methods proposed by Touloumis et al. (2015).

To estimate ER and 2c, shrinkage approaches are employed.
These have been found to be extremely useful in constructing reli—
able gene networks (see Schafer and Strimmer, 2005). The novel
shrinkage covariance estimators derived in the Supplementary
Material are statistically efficient and practical because they are in—
vertible and easy to calculate regardless the number of genes and tis—
sues. In addition, HDTD allows users to study correlation patterns
of the genes or tissues by testing against known covariance struc—
tures (Touloumis et al., 2014). The non—parametric nature of our
analysis provides some robustness against non—normality.

3 Multiple tissue example

Melé et al. (2015) investigated variability in the human transcrip—
tome across multiple tissues by analyzing RNA sequencing
(RNAseq) data from the Genotype—Tissue Expression project. This
project identified, among other things, genes whose expression sig—
nature characterized particular tissues. To accomplish this, Melé
et al. (2015 ) used essentially all available tissue—samples from each
of the 175 individuals by aggregating gene expression levels across
the tissue tested and the remaining tissues (see 83.5 in
Supplementary Material in Melé et al., 2015). This approach does
not acknowledge the tissue—wise correlation and consequently, this
can affect the discovery of tissue—specific gene lists (Touloumis et al.,
2015 ). Since HDTD requires measurements from the same set of tis—
sues across subjects, we considered a subset of this dataset including
only the subjects (N: 11) with available RNAseq samples across all
the most frequently collected tissues (skin, nerve, adipose, artery,
lung, skeletal muscle, heart, blood and thyroid). A 44781 X 9 data
matrix was created for each subject, with rows corresponding to
genes, columns corresponding to the samples from the nine tissues
and entries corresponding to the RPKM values. We use RPKM val—
ues for consistency with the original publication but we excluded
genes where the sum of the RPKM values across the tissues was less
than 0.1. To illustrate benefits when utilizing HDTD, we focused on
two important inferential aspects: (i) study of the dependence struc—
ture among the nine tissues and (ii) corroboration of the gene signa—
tures when the dependence between tissues is accounted for.

To study the tissue—specific variability, we estimated the corres—
ponding covariance matrix 2c (Table S1 in the Supplementary
Material). Blood was by far the most variable tissue (SE: 870.4),
with SE at least four times that of the other tissues. To study the

tissue—wise correlation, we calculated the correlation matrix from 2c
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Material). We observed that lung,
skeletal muscle, heart and thyroid were mildly correlated with each
other (correlations 2 0.1), while the remaining tissues showed
weaker strength of correlation. To investigate the statistical signifi—
cance of our observation, we employed the sphericity test
(Touloumis et al., 2014) to all possible tissue pairs so as to identify
correlated pairs of tissues. After applying an FDR correction, we
failed to reject the sphericity hypothesis for the tissue pairs listed in
Table S3 in the Supplementary Material. To summarize these re—
sults, there seems to exist a weak but statistically significant tissue—
wise correlation pattern that needs to be considered when analyzing
the gene expression pattern across tissues.

Melé et al. (2015 ) generated lists of genes that showed tissue—spe—
cific expression (Table S5 in Melé et al., 2015 ). For a given tissue,
we tested the hypotheses of conservation of the overall mean gene—
expression levels of the corresponding genes—list between this tissue
and any of the other eight, leading to a total of eight P—values, to
which we applied an FDR correction. Failure to reject all hypotheses
means that we do not have enough evidence that these genes are tis—
sue—specific in their expression. After performing this analysis, we
confirmed the validity of the tissue—specific gene—lists for skin, nerve,
lung, skeletal muscle, heart and blood tissue. However, we
failed to confirm that the overall mean gene—expression levels of
the thyroid—specific gene—list is different in skeletal muscle
(P—value: 0.782); that of the adipose—specific gene—list different in
the skin (P—value:0.105), and that of the artery—specific gene—list
different in skin (P—value : 0.668), in adipose (P—value : 0.716), and
in blood (P—value:0.145). We also failed to reject the hypothesis
that the mean gene—expression pattern for the artery—specific genes is
simultaneously preserved across artery, skin, adipose and blood tis—
sues (P—value : 0.412), which is in accordance with the pairwise tis—
sue analysis. The difference in our conclusions compared to those in
Melé et al. (2015 ) presumably arises because the methods in HDTD
account for the presence of the tissue—wise correlation, regardless of
its strength, a key inferential property that is not discussed by Melé
et al. (2015).

4Summary

Although HDTD was motivated by and illustrated using multi—
tissue gene expression data, we emphasize that HDTD is suitable
for analyzing other types of high—dimensional transposable data
including single—cell transcriptomics data (see Lee et al., 2014;
Lovatt et al., 2014) sampled from different tissues. In these studies,
HDTD should lead to more robust inference since it accounts for
both the gene— and tissue—wise correlation and is reliable for large
numbers of cells without a dramatic increase in the computational
cost.

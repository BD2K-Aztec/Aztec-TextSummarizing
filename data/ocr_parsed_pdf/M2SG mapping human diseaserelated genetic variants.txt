ABSTRACT

Summary: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a manually
curated compendium of human genetic variants and the correspond-
ing phenotypes, mostly human diseases. Instead of directly docu-
menting the native sequences for gene entries, OMIM links its
entries to protein and DNA sequences in other databases. However,
because of the existence of gene isoforms and errors in OMIM
records, mapping a specific OMIM mutation to its corresponding
protein sequence is not trivial. Combining computer programs and
extensive manual curation of OMIM full-text descriptions and original
literature, we mapped 98% of OMIM amino acid substitutions (AASs)
and all SwissProt Variant (SwissVar) disease-related AASs to reference
sequences and confidently mapped 99.96% of all AASs to the gen-
omic loci. Based on the results, we developed an online database and
interactive web server (M2SG) to (i) retrieve the mapped OMIM and
SwissVar variants for a given protein sequence; and (ii) obtain related
proteins and mutations for an input disease phenotype. This database
will be useful for analyzing sequences, understanding the effect of
mutations, identifying important genetic variations and designing
experiments on a protein of interest.

1 INTRODUCTION

Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (McKusick,
2007) consists of full-text overviews of phenotypes, especially
human diseases, and the corresponding genetic variants including
substitutions, deletions, insertions and intervening sequences. The
information in OMIM is derived from literature and documented
manually by human curators. OMIM is a valuable database to
associate phenotypes and human diseases with particular genes;
however, it is not a reliable resource to assign these phenotypes to
certain mutations in the corresponding proteins. A previous
report (Li et al., 2012) suggested that >20% of amino acid sub-
stitutions (AASs) in OMIM cannot be mapped to the canonical

sequences in SwissProt (i.e. either the mutation position or the
residue type is inconsistent with the SwissProt sequence)
(preiler et al., 2004). This discrepancy mainly results from
OMIM mutations being derived from literature, where authors
report different gene isoforms. In addition, errors in the manual
OMIM records are another obstacle for conﬁdent mapping.

Previous studies attempted to map the OMIM AASs onto
SwissProt sequences (Martin, 2005; Peterson et al., 2010; Yip
et al., 2004). However, the mutations that cannot be conﬁdently
mapped were simply excluded or ignored. In 2005, Martin
designed an automated procedure to maintain a validated map-
ping between OMIM AASs and SwissProt entries. However, the
performance was not sufﬁcient. In all, 20% of all the entries fall
into their class C, meaning not all the associated mutations could
be mapped. In addition, the simple offset approach they applied
could cause a considerable rate of false-positives.

Combining automatic tools and manual curation, we mapped
98% of OMIM AASs and all disease-related genetic variants in
SwissProt Variant (SwissVar) to SwissProt reference sequences
(RSs) and compiled a database, M2SG @apping mutations t_o
Sequence and gene). (A detailed comparison between our work
and previous studies is in Supplementary Table S1). In all, 99.96%
of these mutations are mapped to the genomic loci and 99.2%
can be attributed to either single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in dbSNP database or putative SNPs, which validated
our mapping at the protein level. In addition, we provide a user-
friendly interface to search the database with various queries. We
expect it to be a useful resource for understanding the effects of
mutations and experimental work on the disease-related proteins.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mapping mutations to RS

OMIM and SwissProt databases [March, 2012] were obtained as ﬁatﬁles,
supplemented by querying their web interfaces. The cross-references be-
tween SwissProt and OMIM entries were obtained by the cross-links in
databases. The canonical sequences of the SwissProt entries were used as
RSs. AASs in the SwissVar database can be directly mapped to RS, where-
as OMIM AASs were processed hierarchically by the following methods:
Direct mapping: If all ‘native’ residues in OMIM mutations from one
OMIM entry match the residues in the RS at the positions indicated in
the OMIM records, we consider the mutations to be validated directly.
BLAST mapping: Due to the presence of multiple gene isoforms and
errors in coding region prediction of genes, the original studies cited in
OMIM might have referred to an alternative native sequence (ANS).
Presumably the ANS should be highly similar to our RS, and thus we
identiﬁed them by BLAST (E-value = 0.001 , Altschul et al., 1997) against

the non-redundant database from the RS, ﬁltered by higher than 98%
sequence identity computed ignoring gaps to improve detection of exon-
skipped isoforms. If all the mutations of an OMIM entry can be mapped
to the ANS, this ANS was used as an intermediate to map the mutations
to RS and correct the mutation positions to match those in the RS.

Offset mapping: In many cases, the ANSs used in the original study
were not present in NR but could be deduced by applying an offset to the
residue numbers in the RS. This strategy is equivalent to truncating or
extending the open reading frames of the encoding gene for the RS. The
offset that maximized the number of mutations that could be correctly
mapped was tested. If these offset mutations could be cross-validated by
records in the SwissVar database or they corresponded to all the muta-
tions from one OMIM entry containing at least three mutations, the
deduced offset was considered valid and used to map these mutations.

Manual mapping: We manually checked the OMIM mutation descrip-
tion, information in SwissProt and the original literature for mutations
that could not be mapped by the automatic methods. A considerable
amount of errors in OMIM mutation record were detected, and several
types of errors are exempliﬁed in Supplementary Figure S].

2.2 Mapping mutations to genomic loci and SNPs

A portion of OMIM and SwissVar entries have links to the dbSNP data-
base (Sherry et al., 2001), which provides the genomic loci and correspond-
ing SNPs. For those without such links, we applied the PICMI server
(Le Pera et al., 2010) to map the mutations to the genomic loci and putative
SNPs. For cases where PICMI failed, we combined computational and
manual approaches to align our RSs to the corresponding protein se-
quences in the Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2013) or CCDS (Pruitt et al., 2009)
database, which were used as intermediates to map mutations to genomic
loci and deduce SNPs that could cause these AASs in the proteins.

3 RESULTS

We mapped >98% of OMIM AASs, and the number of muta-
tions mapped by each method is shown in Figure 1A. Although
the majority of OMIM mutations can be conﬁdently mapped
by computer programs, manual curation was applied to a con-
siderable portion (18.0%). A small portion of OMIM mutations
(2.7%) could not be mapped due to the lack of evidence even in
the cited literature (Supplementary Table S2) or missing cross-
links between OMIM and SwissProt entries. To make the muta-
tions consistent with the RS, 3096 out of 13 221 OMIM mutation
records were modiﬁed. Most of these modiﬁcations involved a
shift in the residue number and 4% corrected other OMIM
annotation errors (Supplementary Table S3).

The current M2SG database includes 12855 AASs from 2292
OMIM entries and 21 405 disease-related AASs from 1727 pro-
teins in SwissVar. OMIM and SwissVar AASs overlap partially,
and our mapping revealed 33 redundant AASs in OMIM, resulting
in a total of 2315 proteins with 26 851 AASs (Fig. 1B).
Interestingly, 596 out of 36 942 functionally neutral mutations in
SwissVar are disease causing according to OMIM (Supplementary
Table S4), indicating possible errors in either database.

In all, 99.96% of the mutations in M2SG are mapped to the
genomic loci and 99.2% can be attributed to either SNPs in the
dbSNP or other single nucleotide changes in the genomic loci
(Fig. 1C), which validated mutations in M2SG. In contrast, ori-
ginal OMIM mutation records yielded a 24% failure rate for this
genomic loci and SNP mapping (Fig. 1D).

Our results are presented as an online database with a user-
friendly interface. The database can be queried by protein

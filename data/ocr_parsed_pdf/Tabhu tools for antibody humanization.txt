Tabhu: tools for antibody humanization

 

of the binding mode is based on the proABC method that we
have previously developed (Olimpieri et al, 2013), that predicts
the probability that every single antibody residue is involved in
antigen recognition taking into account the entire sequence of the
variable domains. If the pattern of interaction is very different
between the input and humanized sequence, it can be expected
that the resulting binding mode, and most likely the affinity, will
be different. More details on the formula used to evaluate indi—
vidual back—mutation importance are reported as Supplementary
Material.

Once the user selects which residues to back—mutate and sub—
mits them to the system, a new variant is generated and the
process can be repeated. However, the introduction of mutations
in the human antibody can lead to structural problems, such as
the appearance of clashes or cavities in the modelled humanized
antibody. Taking advantage of our antibody structure prediction
tools (Chailyan et al, 2011; Marcatili et al, 2008), upon user
request, Tabhu builds the three—dimensional models of the mouse
and humanized antibodies, runs the procheck and EDTSurf
tools (Laskowski et al, 1996; Xu and Zhang, 2009) and alerts
the user if the introduction of a back—mutation generates clashes
or cavities, that the user can ignore or use as a guide to remove or
introduce additional back—mutations.

When the desired binding mode similarity between the xeno—
geneic and humanized antibody has been achieved the user can
finalize the model and retrieve the three—dimensional model of
the parental antibody, the amino acid sequence of the selected
human template, the contact probabilities of the humanized anti—
body, the amino acid sequence of the final redesigned antibody
and a back—translated nucleotide sequence optimized for being
expressed in a number of organisms. Supplementary Material,
Supplementary File S1 reports an example of antibody human—
ization with Tabhu.

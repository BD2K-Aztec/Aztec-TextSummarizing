Abstract

Summary: Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB) is a small virtual machine version of the popular
University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browserthat can be run on a researcher’s own
computer. Once GBiB is installed, a standard web browser is used to access the virtual server and
add personal data files from the local hard disk. Annotation data are loaded on demand through
the Internet from UCSC or can be downloaded to the local computer for faster access.

Availability and implementation: Software downloads and installation instructions are freely avail—
able for non—commercial use at https://genome—store.ucsc.edu/. GBiB requires the installation of
open—source software VirtualBox, available for all major operating systems, and the UCSC
Genome Browser, which is open source and free for non—commercial use. Commercial use of GBiB
and the Genome Browser requires a license (http://genome.ucsc.edu/license/).

1 Introduction

Custom data display is a popular feature of modern genome brows-
ers, allowing users to view their own private genome annotations
alongside publicly available data. The University of California Santa
Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (Karolchik et (11., 2014; Kent et (11.,
2002) has supported user-generated custom annotation tracks since
2001, and recently added support for track and assembly data hubs
(Nguyen et 111., 2014; Raney et (11., 2014) that allow the user to host
collections of large data files on a local server and configure many
details of the visualization. However, these solutions require the
data files to be uploaded onto a web server or stored on a genome
browser’s servers, a drawback that has become increasingly prob-
lematic as data file sizes expand and analysis involves sensitive gen-
omic patient data. Locally installed genome browser applications
like Integrative Genomics Viewer (Thorvaldsdéttir et (11., 2013) miti-
gate this problem but typically include significantly fewer genome
annotations.

The UCSC Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB) circumvents these
issues, offering secure local use of private data files while still pro-
viding access to the full suite of UCSC Genome Browser tools and
annotations. We use an x86 virtual machine, which simulates a com-
plete computer (‘guest’) on a normal PC (‘host’). Thanks to the hard-
ware support offered by current CPUs, this configuration has
become almost as fast as a real machine. This kind of virtualization
technology is the basis of cloud computing, typically used in bio-
informatics to distribute analysis tasks on-demand on machines
offered by external providers (Afgan et (11., 2010). Virtualization
tools have become very easy to install on personal computers, and
therefore have been used to simplify the installation of complex bio-
informatics analysis tools like Clovr (Angiuoli et (11., 2011) and the
ENCODE project analysis pipeline (Rosenbloom et (11., 2013). For a
website like the UCSC Genome Browser, the large amount of anno-
at the time of writ-

 

tation data makes virtualization more difficult
ing, UCSC’s database includes more than 5 TB of data for the

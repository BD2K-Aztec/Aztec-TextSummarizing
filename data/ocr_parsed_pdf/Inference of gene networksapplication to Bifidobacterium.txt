ABSTRACT

Motivation: The reliable and reproducible identification of gene
interaction networks represents one of the grand challenges of both
modern molecular biology and computational sciences. Approaches
based on careful collection of literature data and network topological
analysis, applied to unicellular organisms, have proven to offer
results applicable to medical therapies. However, when little a priori
knowledge is available, other approaches, not relying so strongly on
previous literature, must be used. We propose here a novel algorithm
(based on ordinary differential equations) able to infer the interactions
occurring among genes, starting from gene expression steady state
data.

Results: The algorithm was first validated on synthetic and real
benchmarks. It was then applied to the reconstruction of the core of
the amino acids metabolism in Bifidobacterium longum, an essential,
yet poorly known player in the human gut intestinal microbiome,
known to be related to the onset of important diseases, such
as metabolic syndromes. Our results show how computational
approaches can offer effective tools for applications with the
identification of potential new biological information.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in (bio)technology have provided researchers
with several powerful data platforms, able to collect biological
molecules’ activity at the genome-wide level (Guiducci and
Nardini, 2008). Nowadays, such an abundance of data potentially
allows reconstruction of the complex interplay among molecules,
responsible for diverse cellular functions. Network reconstruction,
which is a broad area in modern biology research, focuses on
two main directions (Bansal et (11., 2007): reconstruction of
physical networks, where the relationships inferred represent actual
connections among molecules of a diverse nature (i.e. metabolic
networks), and reconstruction of interactions called inﬂuence
networks. Physical networks allow to infer precise information,

but require (1 priori knowledge to support initial assumptions.
An interesting and successful example of physical network
reconstruction application is given in Chavali et (11. (2008), where
the authors were able to describe in detail several mechanisms
of action occurring in Leishmania major, a protozoan that causes
cutaneous leishmaniasis in mammalian hosts. The network was
reconstructed with extensive data collection, manual curation and
ﬁnally automated topological analysis. Very interestingly, the whole
approach generated hypotheses that were then experimentally
validated to identify therapeutic targets. Therefore, the application
of computational tools to simpler organisms that are in tight relation
with the evolving health state of more complex organisms, like
humans, can bear fruitful results. Conversely to physical networks,
inﬂuence networks infer generic connections among genes, but
require very little preliminary evidence and can therefore be applied
to systems for which little (1 priori knowledge is available.

In this work, we explore a gene network related to
Biﬁdobacterium, a crucial player in the gut intestinal (GI)
microbiome, the importance of which is becoming more and more
central in the onset of several types of diseases, despite little
knowledge available today. The GI tract with its microbiome, in
fact, is an important organ responsible for digestion, absorption
and metabolism of dietary nutrients. It contributes to 9—12% of
whole-body protein synthesis and is the most important route of
entry for foreign antigens (i.e. natural toxins, invading pathogens,
(Wang et (11., 2009). In particular, the human gut is the home of a
complex and vast array of bacterial cells, which are estimated to
be 10 times more numerous than the total number of cells in the
human body (Palmer et (11., 2007), and with a collective genome
(metagenome) that contains at least 100 times as many genes as
our own genome (Gill et (11., 2006). Comparative metagenomics has
uncovered functional attributes of the microbiome involved in the
metabolism of glycans and amino acids, the production of methane
and the biosynthesis of vitamins (Gill et (11., 2006). In particular, the
amino acid (AA) metabolism appears to be a core functional group,
highly consistent across different human microbiome samples.
Processes performed by the microbiome are strictly intertwined with
the host metabolism, to the point that life without this contribution
may not be possible. This concept is summarized in the deﬁnition
of sym-xenobiotic metabolites formed by both gut microbial and
host metabolism that cannot be synthesized by either in isolation,
and which forms no part of the energy metabolism, or biosynthetic
machinery of either system (Nicholson et (11., 2005). In particular,
Biﬁdobacterium longum (a subspecies of Biﬁdobacteria) has been
reported to be crucial in a number of functions and is protective
against the onset of obesity, prodrome of metabolic syndromes [see
only as an example (Zhang et (11., 2010) and our recent validation

in (Liu et (11., 2010)]. Given these fact, we have chosen to apply
our gene network reconstruction method to the AA metabolism of
B.10ngum NCC2705, a particular strain of B.10ngum, isolated from
infant feces, and which genome sequence was the ﬁrst completed
within the Biﬁdobacterium genus (Schell et (11., 2002) and revised
in 2005 (GenBank database accession number no. AE014295).

Our method, network of transcripts wirings (NTW), is an ordinary
differential equations (ODE) based model. Despite prior work
showing good performances (Bansal et (11., 2007), the superiority
of ODE models is far from assessed. However, ODE-based
algorithms frame the reverse engineering problem with the quite
ﬂexible identiﬁcation of a function that describes the variation of
gene expression vector )_r over time )_r’ = f ()_r, p), where )_r represents
the expressions of the 11 genes involved in The network across m
experiments, f is the function that models how the transcriptional
perturbations 1) lead to the new equilibria in )_r.

As pointed out in (Marbach et (11., 2010), an extensive comparison
with previous work is not easy, due to the abundance of algorithms
produced and the partial availability of data and software, and would
represent a work in itself. Nevertheless, we describe here some
recent or popular approaches we will compare to. NIR (Gardner
et (11., 2003) uses a linearized version of this equation, leading
to the matricial form of the linearized equation AX =—P, where
A represents the interaction network (adjacency matrix, n X n), X
the steady state expression values (expression matrix, 11 ><m) and
P the transcriptional perturbations (a matrix of the same size as
X, n ><m). Under the assumption that transcriptional perturbations
triggering the new equilibria are known, NIR assumes that only a
certain number of genes have interactions and minimizes the sum

of squared errors (SSEs) to get the approximation of gene network
matrix. Recently, a parallelized version of NIR has been published
(Gregoretti et (11., 2010). NIRest (Lauria et (11., 2009) builds upon the
original NIR and extends its use to cases in which the perturbations
are not known, assuming only a few genes are perturbed in each
experiment. NIRest ﬁrst produces a rough estimation of the gene
interaction matrix A, it then infers P based on the estimated A and
X.

Based on the same ODE model, other algorithms have been
designed. For example, in Julius et (11. (2009) the smallest possible
genetic network is obtained from the minimization of a convex cost
function over a convex set of feasible solutions. Like NIR, this
algorithm requires the transcriptional perturbations to be known.

Combinatorial perturbation-based interaction analysis (CoPIA;
Nelander et (11., 2008) uses a non-linear function f and minimizes
two errors: an SSE to measure the difference between the model
predicted expression values and the corresponding observational
values, and a structure error, which takes into account the number
of interaction in the predicted gene network.

Finally in Madar et (11. (2010), a mixed model is adopted, using
information theory (mix-CLR method, Faith et (11., 2007) to extract
preliminary knowledge and an ODE model (Inferelator, Efron et (11.,
2004; Tibshirani, 1996) to reﬁne it. We had also considered this type
of approach and tested it using ARACNe (Margolin et (11., 2006) and
NIR (Gardner et (11., 2003) with little success (data not published).

Our method, NTW, is part of this large family of ODE methods,
which make use, like NIR and NIRest, of a linearized version of
the original equation (AX = —P). The major advance offered by our
approach compared with the seminal work in Gardner et (11. (2003)

and its recent improvement in Gregoretti et (11. (2010) lies in the
ability to estimate A when P is unknown. Figure 1 schematically
shows the basic principles on which the algorithm is based multiple
regression is used to minimize both the error on the inferred A and P,
see details in the Section 2).

2 METHODS

2.1 Culture conditions and real-time RT—PCR

Biﬁdobacteria longum NCC2705 was stored in Lactobacilli MRS Broth
(BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) plus 50% glycerol at
—80°C. Twenty microliter stock solution were transferred into 3 ml
MRS broth supplemented with 0.05% L-cysteine (MRSC; Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany) and cultured anaerobically using MGC anaerobic
system (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company) at 37°C for 48 h. Then 5 ug/ml
of puromycin, streptomycin, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, cycloheximide
and erythromycin were added into each MRSC tube separately as
perturbations of the amino acid metabolism. Biﬁdobacteria longum
NCC2705 growing in MRSC without any perturbations was used as control.
After 40 h, B.longum NCC2705 was harvested for RNA isolation.

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Kit
(QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions and then treated
with RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN) before cDNA synthesis. Reverse
transcription (RT) was performed using PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit
(TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time
PCR was performed using SYBR PrimeScriptTM RT-PCR Kit II (TaKaRa,
Kyoto, Japan) on the LightCycler 480 (Roche). 16S rDNA transcript
(Matsuki et (11., 1999) was used as an endogenous control. The conditions
of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were 95°C for 30 s, 40 cycles
of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 20 s followed by the condition for melt curve
analysis: 95°C for 0 s, 60°C for 15 s and 95°C for 0 5. Primers were designed
with the Primer Premier 5.0 software. Forward and reverse primer sequences
are listed in the Supplementary Materials. Cross-point threshold (C,) and
real-time ﬂuorescence data were obtained using LightCycler 480 Software
Version 1.5. Default software parameters were adopted to calculate C,. The
reaction efﬁciency E of each amplicon in each reaction was calculated
using qpcR (Ritz and Spiess, 2008), an R package for quantitative real-
time PCR analysis, with a ﬁve-parameter logistic model to ﬁt onto qPCR
data as described in Gardner et a1. (2003). More details are also given in the
Supplementary Materials.

2.2 NTW

The linearization of the )_r’ =f(§,p) equation modeling the network was
performed based on the same assumptions in (Gardner et (11., 2003; Gregoretti
et (11., 2010; Julius et (11., 2009; Lauria et (11., 2009), i.e. truncation of the
Taylor series of f at an equilibrium point in regime of small perturbations.
To free the network reconstruction from the necessity to know P, NTW
processes X to rank genes in each experiment by their absolute expression
values, and selects TopK genes with the highest values as potential target
genes. It then produces a Boolean matrix IX where ixijzl if entry xi]-
in matrix X is a potential transcriptional trigger, and ixij=0 otherwise.
In our experience, TopK 50.3 X n is sufﬁcient to identify the most likely
perturbation triggers and store them in matrix IX , used to reconstruct
perturbations P. Matrix A can then be computed row wise by using multiple
regression of each row of P on the corresponding row of X , with the same
sparsity assumptions as NIR and NIRest that the number of interactions
associated with each gene is at most restK and that self-interaction on a gene
is always present provided the gene is perturbed in the system. To compute
the i-th row a? of A, NTW iteratively searches an optimal vector P, as the
i-th row of P. The searching space of Pi consists of vectors determined by
all non-empty subsets in the power set S: 2(kllxik #0’195’"). As a result, the
cardinality of the searching space of Pi is |S| — 1, where |S| represents the
number of elements in set S. Given the upper value of TopK, the number

of non-zero entries in each row of IX is small and so is the cardinality of S
and the searching space of Pi. The identiﬁcation of optimal Pi and thus a?
is then calculated through the minimization of the objective function SSE,
for regression of row i, and the reliabilities of interactions are given by the
corresponding absolute interaction strengths.

For the inference of matrix P, NTW switches to compute SSE on the
expression data matrix X. Namely, since P is a variable and not an input
in NTW, it is not possible to use P as a reference to compute the error.
Consequently, the row wise computation on SSE, is performed on partial
portions of the matrices P and A, i.e. SSE,»=||(tmpA_l lepP)i—Xi||2,
where tmpA is an identity matrix with its i-th row being replaced by (if;
tmpP is a matrix of all zeros with its i-th row being replaced by Pi, and
H - H is the Euclidean norm. The rationale is that we assume self-connections
(elements on the diagonal of A) to always be true (Gardner et (11., 2003). The
matrix inversion necessary for calculating SSE can be avoided thanks to the
peculiar structure of tmpA (only one row of tmpA differs from the same size
identity matrix, more details provided in Supplementary Materials) and can
therefore be obtained Via simple column elimination. Thus, the computation
cost of NTW is dominated by the cost of the multiple regression that can
be done Via QR decomposition in 0(n2m2|S|) for efﬁciency and numeric
stability. More details on the computational complexity and the pseudo code
for NTW are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

2.3 Networks performances

Global performances are computed as a function of the amount of information
embedded in the network, and in particular in the edges between nodes. In
general, this depends, with increasing difﬁculties of network reconstruction,
on whether we are interested or not in the direction of the interaction between
genes (directed and undirected networks, respectively, edges values 0, 1) and
in the fact that regulation causes activation/inhibition of the target (directed
signed or directed unsigned networks, edges values 0, +1, —1).

Assessment of the performances of an algorithm are usually done by
deﬁning positives (P) and negatives (N) that label items according to
the two values 0,1 they assume in a reference Gold Standard (GS) and
by deﬁning true (T) and false (F), which represent the ability of the
algorithm to classify a given item in agreement with the GS. In case of
signed networks, the deﬁnitions of I; F, N, P require an extension due
to the presence of positives (+1, —1) (Nardini et (11., 2008). For the
computation of the performances, we used the R package MultiClassTest
designed by Yuanhua Liu at CAS-MPG PICB (available at CRAN and
at http://www.picb.ac.cn/ClinicalGenomicNTW/software.html). This allows
the computation of the performances class by class (+1, —1, 0) as
well as summary (binarized) performances (classes :l:1 and 0). In this
article, binarized results are displayed and performances are computed in
terms of PPV: ﬁpm, (precision rate) and Se: “31% (recall rate). When
not differently stated, results are computed for directed networks, never
for undirected, and when the GS provides it, we also computed signed
performances. The area under the curve (AUC) of the precision/sensitivity
curve plots the couples (PPV, Se) for varying values of the threshold that
deﬁnes the elements of A as True (ls) or False (Os), and it is used as a
summary statistic. For comparison with other algorithms, the computation
of AUC was only possible when the A matrix of continuous values was
provided.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Benchmarks validation

Different synthetic and real datasets were used to test and validate
our algorithm. The data used consist of the baseline (unperturbed)
expression levels of genes and of their values reached at the new
equilibrium (perturbed), as well as the known network of interaction
GS. Performances are evaluated in terms of the ability of NTW

to reconstruct the network for varying sizes of the dataset and
for changing values of the expected maximum connectivity among
genes, a tunable parameter of NTW. This corresponds to the sparsity
of matrix A, and although its deﬁnition implies some guess or a
priori knowledge on genes interconnectivity, we will show that,
importantly, performances do not depend crucially on varying values
of this parameter.

Synthetic data: synthetic datasets were used as proposed
by the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and
Methods (DREAM, wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream) Consortium,
an international effort to improve exchanges among researchers
in the area of molecular networks reconstruction. In particular,
from DREAM 2, the dataset ‘Heterozygous InSilico 1 Challenge 4’,
which contains steady state levels of 50 genes of an hypothetical
wild-type organism and 50 heterozygous knock-down strains were
used; from DREAM 3, data of the same type but of three different
sizes (10, 50 and 100 genes); from DREAM 4, data of both size 10
and size 100 each with three types of simulations: knock-out, knock-
down and multifactorial perturbations (versus single perturbation)
were used. Results in Figure 2 indicate how performances are stable
(variations around the mean are small) with respect to the size of
the dataset (x-axes, Size).

Although performances variations can be seen for different values
of the maximum sparsity allowed by the reconstruction algorithm
(y-axes, Sparsity)—this indicates that a (biological) knowledge of
the maximum connectivity among genes can be relevant for a better
reconstruction of the network—performances remain good across
the whole range of variation.

Real data: We tested our approach on two real datasets. The ﬁrst
dataset, published in Gardner et al. (2003), has been re-used several
times in gene network reconstruction and is therefore a known
benchmark. This dataset represents a portion of the SOS pathway in
Escherichia coli, and consists of RNA expression changes resulting
from a set of nine steady state transcriptional perturbations. The
second dataset was published in Nelander et al. (2008) to validate
another ODE-based method, and consists of perturbations on
MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells. As perturbants of the system,
compounds targeting EGFR (ZD1839), mTOR (rapamycin), MEK
(PD0325901), PKC-(S (rottlerin), PI3 kinase (LY294002) and IGFlR
(A12 anti-IGFlR inhibitory antibody) were used. In this network,
the targets of perturbants are unknown, i.e. P is unavailable. Results,

shown in Figure 3, give rise to several interesting observations. First
of all, as expected, prediction of the unsigned network appears to be
easier than prediction of the signed network. We observe also that
performances are more sensitive to sparsity for signed networks.
This is consistent with the more challenging reconstruction offered
by directed signed networks. Finally, although this may be an early
generalization, we observe that NTW (and in general gene network
reconstruction algorithms) appear to perform better on E. coli than
on human cell lines, the most straightforward explanation for this
fact is that unicellular organisms represents simpler systems, and are
therefore easier to reconstruct.

In order to give meaning to the performances shown in Figures 2
and 3, we present here comparisons with published algorithms,
chosen based on the benchmarks and the underlying model (ODE)
they use. Results are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Difﬁculties
in comparison depend critically from the poor availability of
algorithms. In fact, the results on DREAM 3 of CLR + Inferelator in
Table l were obtained directly from (Madar et al., 2010) and those on
MCF7 of CoPIA in Table 2 were from (Nelander et al., 2008). Since
the authors reported in Madar et al. (2010) that CLR+Inferelator
performs very poorly on DREAM 2, these results were neglected
in Table 1. Another limiting factor lies in the lack of widespread
usage of common benchmarks, and partially in the availability of
reliable benchmarks. In fact, even the excellent DREAM initiative
retains the limitation due to the use of synthetic networks. As
shown in the tables, NTW shows interesting performances on a
variety of benchmarks. In particular, NTW behaves excellently in
both signed SOS and unsigned MCF7 networks. In other cases,
NTW also shows comparable performance among all four ODE
algorithms, especially compared with NIRest. To further compare
the performances of NTW and NIRest, we used another interesting
datasets recently published (Cantone et al., 2009). We found that in
such datasets, NTW performs much better than NIRest in all cases
(see Supplementary Table III).

3.2 Application to B.longum

Biﬁdobacteria are natural commensals in the gastrointestinal tract of
humans and mammals, which have been used as markers to indicate
the presence of a healthy microbiota in humans and are included
in a variety of commercial food products accompanied by health-
related claims (Klijn et al., 2005). Despite their increasing use, the
impact of various probiotic preparations on resident members of the
gut microbiota and on the host are generally lacking (Sonnenburg

et al., 2006). Furthermore, the elaborate gene regulation network and
metabolic pathway of biﬁdobacteria remains unclear. We therefore
applied our method to B.longum NCC2705 to verify whether
known data could be validated, and if novel information could be
reasonably proposed to aid the reconstruction of part of the amino
acid biosynthesis pathway, shown in Figure 4.

Valine, leucine and isoleucine are branched chain amino acids
(BCAAs) whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point.
BCAAs are considered to be essential amino acids because
they cannot be synthesized in human beings. Hence, they must
be ingested, usually as a component of proteins. BCAAs are
synthesized in plants and microorganisms via several steps starting
from pyruvic acid (Lehninger et al., 2005). Although information
on Biﬁdobacteria are far from complete, the valine, leucine and
isoleucine biosynthesis pathway exist for B.longum NCC2705 on
KEGG database (PATHWAY: b1000290) and can be used as GS.

The application of our approach to this pathway was performed
in two steps. First, we investigated how performances change in
the cases in which different amounts of a priori information are
available, i.e. some of the non-null values of A are known. This
presents another feature of NTW, able to embed known information
in the computation of the network. We observed that AUCO =0.58

Several large projects—notably the International Human
Microbiome Consortium (IHMC) launched in 2008 that includes
the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) funded by NIH, and the
metaHIT project funded by the EU—are currently contributing
to elucidate the role of the GI microbiome as a whole, via the
study of variations in its composition and also at the individual
level with sequencing of hundreds of bacteria strains. Therefore,
given the ongoing research on GI bacteria, it is likely that novel
information becomes available. This could then efﬁciently be re-
used to improve network prediction. As expected, the results show
improving performances when more information is offered.

Second, we compared the results inferred by NTW without
a priori knowledge, to investigate its ability not only to validate
but also to possibly predict novel information, see Figure 4. In
terms of validation, several key reaction steps of this pathway
have been reconstructed by NTW: pyruvate is catalyzed by
ilvB to produce 2-hydroxyethyl-ThPP, which is then catalyzed
by ilvB to produce (S)-2-acetolactate. Next (S)-2-acetolactate is
catalyzed by iva2 to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate,
which is the precursor of valine; in parallel, 2-hydroxyethyl-ThPP
together with 2-oxobutanoate (which is catalyzed by tch on the
basis of threonine) produce (S)-aceto-2-hydroxybutanoate, which
is then catalyzed by iva2 to produce (R)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-
oxopentanoate, the precursor of isoleucine. This result conﬁrms
that isoleucine and valine syntheses appear to be independently
regulated despite the fact that the same enzyme system is used
(Westfall et al., 1983).

4 DISCUSSION

From the benchmarks validation, NTW shows some interesting
advantages over other state-of—the-art methods. More concretely,
comparing to NIR (Gardner et al., 2003; Gregoretti et al., 2010),
NTW does not need to know P, which can be an important
unknown of the system, to computeA. Comparing to NIRest (Lauria
et al., 2009), NTW directly produces a rough perturbation matrix
without computing an estimate of A ﬁrst, and infers A and P by

minimizing the SSEs for each candidate perturbation. This may
have the advantage that the estimate of P depends directly and only
on the experimental data (X), and not from previous assumptions
on A. Although biological phenomena are highly non-linear, we
observe that our algorithm is able to reconstruct gene networks with
performances comparable or superior to CoPIA (Nelander et al.,
2008) (which uses a non-linear ODE model) at least on the dataset
proposed. Given the simpler underlying model, NTW requires less
tuning, which can be an advantage given the application of these
approaches to systems where a priori data, necessary for an informed
setting of the parameters, are poor.

In relation to the application to B.longum, as shown in Figure 4,
two new interactions: glmS-ilvB and tch-purF have been predicted
by NTW. In particular, tch is an amidophosphoribosyltransferase
related to the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and
purF is a L—threonine ammonia-lyase associated with valine, leucine
and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway, both can be found in the
KEGG database (PATHWAY: b1000290). However, due to the
limited information currently available on these two genes, it is
difﬁcult to speculate on the validity of this connection predicted
by NTW. Conversely, although there is no direct evidence to prove
the interaction between ilvB and glmS, one study demonstrated that
they are novel ClpCP targets in glucose-starved Bacillus subtilis
and can be radioimmunoprecipitated together (Gerth et al., 2008).
Since ilvB initiates the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino
acids and glmS catalyzes the ﬁrst step in hexosamine metabolism,
converting Fructose-6P into Glucosamine-6P using glutamine as
a nitrogen source, the interaction between ilvB and glmS could
regulate the initiation of both of these two metabolic pathways.
This also suggests that there could be an overlap between these
two pathways in B.longum NCC2705.

In consideration of the limited number of genes identiﬁed in
B.longum NCC2705, our experiment has not covered all the genes
likely to be associated with the amino acid metabolic pathway.
However, the sub-network of the amino acid metabolism of
B.longum NCC2705 inferred by NTW provides interesting insight
into this little-known and yet important GI bacterium.

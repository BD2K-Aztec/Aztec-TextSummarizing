Name Number Content
of records
CITATION 21 M Metadata relevant for each PubMed citation
SENTENCE 119.1 M Sentences from each PubMed citation
CONCEPT 1.3 M Relevant information about UMLS Metathesaurus concepts
CONCEPT_SEMTYPE 1.5M One-to-many relationships between concepts and their semantic types from UMLS semantic network
PREDICATION 12.9 M Unique predications

PREDICATION_ARGUMENT 27.5 M
SENTENCE_PREDICATION 57.6 M
PREDICATION_AGGREGATE 57.6 M

Links between each predication and its subject and object contained in CONCEPT table
Links between a sentence and a predication extracted from it
Convenience table that aggregates information from all of the tables above for more efficient access

 

information regarding PubMed citations, relevant UMLS know—
ledge and the semantic predications. A brief description of the
content of each table and the approximate number of records in
it are provided in Table 2. The UMLS—related tables
(CONCEPT*) contain information from a modiﬁed version of
the UMLS 2006AA release, adapted for SemRep. The descrip—
tions of data fields in each table are explained in detail in the
online documentation. The entity—relationship diagram of the
database is also provided.

The preprocessing of PubMed for SemMedDB takes about
2 months. Citations are first retrieved from PubMed using the
NCBI E—utilities API and then processed by SemRep in a dis—
tributed computing environment. The latest version of the re—
pository has ~57.6M predications extracted from 21 M
citations (dated June 30, 2012 or earlier). We process newly
added citations at regular intervals and update the repository
with the extracted predications.

3 USE CASES

SemMedDB is being used to support a range of biomedical
applications, especially for literature—based discovery and hy—
pothesis generation. Miller et al. (2012) proposed a mechanistic
link between cortisol, testosterone and age—related sleep—quality
decline, while Wilkowski et al. (2011) applied graph—theoretical
notions to elucidate the relation between sleep and depression.
More recently, Goodwin et al. (2012) replicated these results by
exploiting information foraging theory. Cohen et a]. (2012)
used analogical reasoning in a high—dimensional vector space
to suggest drug therapies. Similarly, Hristovski et a]. (2012) pro—
posed predication space for drug target discovery and drug
repurposing, whereas Hristovski et al. (2010) combined predica—
tions with DNA microarray data to generate novel hypotheses
on Parkinson disease. We are currently combining predications
with microarray data to automatically generate gene regulatory
networks.

SemMedDB has formed the basis of several clinical applica—
tions. J onnalagadda et al. (2012) generate therapy—oriented sum—
maries to support clinical decision making, while Liu et al. (2012)
elucidate the association between medical concepts co—occurring
in clinical reports. The repository also underpinned a recent
study to identify interactions between drugs mentioned in clinical
reports.

4 CONCLUSION

We described the SemMedDB repository, which makes the
semantic content of all PubMed citations as extracted by
SemRep available to the research community. The utility of
the repository for hypothesis generation, literature—based discov—
ery and clinical decision making has so far been demonstrated
from within the Semantic MEDLINE paradigm and independ—
ently. Given its scale and size, this repository can further serve as
the basis of advanced data—mining techniques and assist in un—
covering novel relationships in biomedicine.

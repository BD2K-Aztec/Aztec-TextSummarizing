ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene expression measurements are the most common
data source for reverse engineering gene interaction networks. When
dealing with destructive sampling in time course experiments, it is
common to average any available measurements for each time point
and to treat this as the actual time series data for fitting the network,
neglecting the variability contained in the repeated measurements.
Proceeding in such a way can affect the retrieved network topology.
Results: We propose a fully Bayesian method for reverse
engineering a gene interaction network, based on time course
data with repeated measurements. The observations are treated
as surrogate measurements of the underlying gene expression.
As these measurements often contain outliers, we use a non-
Gaussian specification for dealing with measurement error. The
network interactions are assumed linear and an autoregressive model
is specified, augmented with indicator variables that allow inference
on the topology of the network. We analyse two in silico and
one in vivo experiments, the latter dealing with the circadian clock
in Arabidopsis thaliana. A systematic attenuation of the estimated
regulation strengths and a concomitant overestimation of their
precision is demonstrated when measurement error is disregarded.
Thus, a clear improvement in the inferred topology for the synthetic
datasets is demonstrated when this is included. Also, the influence
of outliers in the retrieved network is demonstrated when using the
in vivo data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying and understanding gene regulatory networks is of key
importance in Systems Biology. Reverse engineering such networks
is thus paramount and a plethora of literature dealing with the
problem has developed in recent years (see Bansal et (11., 2007;
Hache et (11., 2009 and references therein). Bayesian networks (BNs)
have been used previously in gene network determination (Friedman
et al., 2000; Friedman, 2004; Hongqiang et al., 2005). However, it is

well known that when followed through time, biological processes
have feedback loops and thus the validity of BNs is questionable
when modelling such systems. Dynamic BNs (DBNs) have been
proposed for modelling time course (longitudinal) gene expression
data (Cao and Zhao, 2008; Murphy and Mian, 1999; Perrin et al.,
2003; Yu et al., 2004; Zou and Conzen, 2005). These can be thought
of as ‘unfolding’ a BN for every time point and when folding it back
self-regulation and cliques may be obtained.

Formally, a DBN is characterized by a set of conditional relations,
p(yt""1 | yt). In the case of a regression-based DBN, these relations
can be written as

yg+1=fgcvt>+sgtk (1)

where y; is the expression level of gene g: l, ...,G, measured at
time I: l, ...,T,yt ={yt1,y§, ...,th} and 8:, is an idiosyncratic error
term.

The approaches above assume one observed time series for each
gene. However, gene expression measurement normally requires
destruction of the sample, e.g. microarrays, and, therefore, the idea
of a longitudinal time series becomes problematic. This is because
a single individual is not followed throughout the experiment, but
rather a population of cells or individuals are sampled and their
gene expression measured. The phenomenon is particularly acute
in experiments with multicellular organisms, where not even the
same population of cells can be followed through time. Thus, rather
than ‘real’ gene expression measurements, we are faced with a
set of surrogate measures. In addition to the uncertainty involved
in the sampling process, it is well known that gene expression
measurement technologies, such as microarrays, render noisy data
and frequently exhibit outliers (Brody et al., 2002; Lewin et al.,
2007).

When repeated measurements are available, time course data used
for reverse engineering gene interaction networks are commonly
obtained as a (weighted) average of these replicates and, therefore,
these sources of uncertainty are ignored. Neglecting the variability
within the replicates can have severe effects when ﬁtting a linear
model, with perhaps the most important being attenuation of
the coefﬁcient estimates (see Carroll et al., 2006; Fuller, 1987).
Working within a univariate ﬁrst-order linear autoregressive setting,
Schmid et al. (1994) demonstrated that neglecting measurement
error yields severe attenuation, of the autoregressive coefﬁcient and
the variability of this estimate. Interpreting this result within the
framework of (l) with a linear speciﬁcation of fl- (yt ), this suggests
that an averaged time series will yield attenuated estimates of the
interactions within the network, with a spurious sense of security
given the concomitant underestimation of the variability of these
estimates.

In the context of regulatory networks, Fujita et al. (2009) examine
the effect of including measurement error in a linear model, both in
static and dynamic contexts. They verify that the OLS estimator of
the regression coefﬁcients is attenuated and that its corresponding
standard error is sub-estimated; then they provide a correction
based on the asymptotic behaviour of the OLS. However, they
do not assume sparsity in the network and, therefore, require
more observations than the number of parameters in the model,
making practical applications of their method to biological network
inference difﬁcult. Further, when dealing with time series data,
they are forced to assume the measurement error precision known,
omitting this source of uncertainty, which in turn will affect the
estimation of the autoregression coefﬁcients’ precision. The main
aim of this article is to show that by neglecting the uncertainty
within the measurement process some biases can be passed on to
the estimated network and, more importantly, that the conﬁdence in
the retrieved network will be spuriously large.

In the sequel, we present a model that takes into account repeated
measurements of time course gene expression data for estimating
the topology of a gene interaction network. We model the network
topology explicitly, enabling us to control for the effective number
of parameters to be estimated and, therefore, able to apply the
methodology to commonly available time course gene expression
datasets, where the number of parameters exceeds the number of
observations. To ease the presentation, we assume an underlying
ﬁrst-order linear autoregressive process, AR(l), for the interaction
network. As gene expression measurements frequently exhibit
heavier-than-normal tail behaviour, we model the measurement
process with Student-t errors. To this end, we present our approach in
Section 2. To account for all sources of uncertainty in the model and
measurement process, modelling and estimation is carried out from
a Bayesian perspective, with our prior speciﬁcation and estimation
procedure explained in Section 3. Illustrations of model ﬁtting and
comparisons with the standard approach are conducted in Section 4.
A ﬁnal discussion is provided in Section 5.

2 APPROACH

Denote by y; the expression level of gene g: l,...,G, measured at
time t = l, .. . , T. We model the interaction network as a linear AR(l)
process,
G
y§+1=ug+zyfﬁjg+8Q (2)
j=l

where Mg is the basal expression level of gene g; [313 = ngﬂjg
measures the inﬂuence of gene j on gene g, with ﬂjg e R and ng = 1,
if j regulates g and ng = 0 otherwise. Finally, 8:, is an idiosyncratic
error term, centred at zero and with precision parameter Ag, typically
assumed to be Gaussian. We augment the model with the parenthood
(link) indicator variables 1" = {ng}, which will be the basis for
estimating the network topology.

Assume now that instead of measuring y; directly, we are
presented with R surrogate measurements X = {xiv}, r= l,...,R. As
mentioned before, the common approach is to calculate

R _1 R

—t t

x8: 2 cog, E wgrxgr, (3)
r=l r=l

with (08,30; and then replace y; in (2) with Sci, Inﬂuence of
possible outliers will depend on the choice of tag ={wg1,...,a)gR}.
The pervasive choice in the literature is to set (ogr: l; but when
outliers are suspected, sometimes a more robust alternative, such as
the median, can be used. In the process of ﬁtting (2), the probability
of any given link being present depends on the relative magnitude
of its associated coefﬁcient, and hence failure of acknowledging
measurement error can yield an attenuated network connectivity.
In Section 3, we provide a fully Bayesian approach to
accommodating measurement error when estimating the topology
of a gene interaction network within a linear AR(l) speciﬁcation.

3 METHODS

To account for the additional uncertainty when repeated measurements are
available, we assume that the regulation process can be captured by (2), but

instead of actually observing yfg, we have noisy measurements, xgr, such that

xgr=yg+ng,. r=1.....R. (4)

with 712, a zero mean measurement error term, with precision parameter rg,
independent for all g,t, r. This error term is frequently assumed Gaussian;
however, given that the measurement process can potentially produce
outliers, we will use a Student-t speciﬁcation, St(n2, | 0, rg, v), such that
Var [712, ] = vrg—l /(v — 2) provided the degrees of freedom, 12 > 2.

When combining (2) and (4), and using the Student-t representation as a
Gamma scale mixture of normals, one can write the likelihood as

GTR

E(®:X)= l‘llTlTMvifl I Mg+y’ﬁg~ig>

g:lt:lr:l (5)
><N(x:,, | yg,wgrrg)Ga(wgrl v/2,v/2).

where Y={y:,} are the unobserved expression levels, X ={xgr} denote
their surrogate measurements and ®={u,B,F,l,t,v} collects the model
parameters, with u = {ul,...,p.G}; B={}3’1,...,}3’G}ERGXG and ﬁg:
{ﬁlg,...,ﬁ(;g}; F={]/,j}; l={A1,...,AG}; and I = {r1,...,rG}.

The Bayesian model is completed by specifying a prior for all the
unknowns. We use a product structure

G
21(8): 210))on [wonmgmogmrromp] . (6)

g2]

and specify componentwise conditionally conjugate priors where suitable.
Thus,

H(Mg)=N(Mg| OJC)w (7)
n(ﬂg)=NG(ﬂg| 0,k,31),g=1,...,G, (8)
ﬂ(}~g)=Gﬂ(}»g | “Avbk)v (9)

H(p)=Be(p| apvbp)v (12)
n(v)=Ga(v| ambv). (13)

Of paramount importance in our modelling is the inclusion of the link
indicator variables, I": {yij}, and their probabilistic structure, controlled by
(11) and (12). By augmenting the model in this way, we are able to switch
the regulation of gene 1' on gene j on or off, controlling for the effective
number of parameters to be estimated. Moreover, the posterior mean of the
link indicators,  are interpreted as the posterior link probabilities, the
building blocks of the network topology retrieval. From a formal Viewpoint,

1" supply the means for performing an automated link selection (see Smith
and Kohn, 1996). The overall connectivity of the network is controlled by p
and any relevant information about this key aspect can be fed into the model
through its prior.

Identiﬁability is always a potential issue when dealing with measurement
error models, ‘particularly when neither gold-standard measurements or pure
replicate measurements can be obtained” (Gustafson, 2004, Section 6.3). This
problem is further compounded in gene network determination where the
number of potential parameters to be estimated ([7 =dim® Z G(G+1)) is
typically much greater than the available data points (n: T X G), i.e. the
so-called p>>n case. From a Bayesian perspective, models are always
identiﬁable as long as a proper prior is speciﬁed. However, this formal
identiﬁability may imply not learning from the data (Poirier, 1998) and thus
calls for a careful elicitation of the prior (Gustafson, 2005). Indeed this is the
case with the model and measurement precision parameters, when repeated
measurements are absent (R: 1). We take advantage of the information
contained in the measurements X about I and use a rather ﬂat prior on this
parameter, while carefully eliciting the parameters for 71(1). To the extent of
our knowledge, there is no conventional prior for the degrees of freedom, 12.
We decided to use a gamma distribution such that P [v 5 30] @06 and with
mode at 15; thus giving roughly prior odds of 3 to 2 for the measurement error
distribution being fat-tailed. A detailed speciﬁcation of the prior parameters
is given in Supplementary Section 2S.

There is no closed analytic expression for the posterior distribution,
71(8 | X) o<E(®;X)Jt(®), and numerical methods to explore it are needed. To
this end, we constructed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We
use Gibbs sampling for all of the parameters except B and v. For the former,
(Morrissey et al., submitted for publication) showed that a Metropolis-
within-Gibbs strategy improves mixing and, therefore, faster convergence
of the chain, and we follow their suggestion. We use a Metropolis step for v
with a Gamma proposal centred at the previous draw and tune its coefﬁcient
of variation to control for the acceptance rate.

In passing, noteworthy is the Gibbs step used for drawing a new non-
observable expression level yfg. These are drawn from a Gaussian distribution,

It is apparent from the expression above that draws of y’ depend on the
weighted average of the observed measures, with the weights determined by
the degrees of freedom through w’ ,. These averages are then combined with
the AR(l) component of the model, thus effectively entertaining all sources of
uncertainty. A detailed description of sampler is presented in Supplementary
Section 3S.

Our estimation method is computationally intensive. Runtime for any
of the measurement error models is not signiﬁcantly longer than for the
plain AR(l), though. Sampler’s 2 X 105 iterations with the 16 gene linear
data used in Section 4.1.1 took 2.10, 2.14 and 2.24h for the AR(l), the
Gaussian and the Student error models, respectively. In terms of scalability,
the algorithms show the usual problems associated with network inference.
Large datasets (i.e. thousands of genes) can take unrealistically long times

to run. Runtime can be reduced by allowing only transcription factors to
be regulators (and possibly other genes that could affect regulation, such as
kinases), encoding such information in the prior through (11). Further, the
algorithm is straightforwardly parallelized, as the parameters for each gene
can be computed independently, the CPU-nodes needing to communicate
only for updating the overall connectivity, p and for collecting the draws,
thus reducing the runtime roughly proportionally to the number of available
CPU-nodes.

4 RESULTS

We analyse two in silica and one in vivo datasets. The simulated
experiments allow us to isolate the effect of explicitly modelling
measurement error in controlled situations and highlight the
attenuation effect. We then turn to a real experiment dealing with
the circadian clock in Arabidopsis thaliana. In all cases, we ﬁt the
model with and without the measurement error component, using the
same prior structure (6)—(13), deleting the relevant terms when not
accounting for measurement error or when assuming it is Gaussian
distributed.

4.1 In silica networks

The ﬁrst synthetic network is linear, and thus serves as a baseline for
comparisons. The second is nonlinear and will allow comparisons
within a more realistic, yet still controlled setting. For each synthetic
dataset, we generate a rather large number of time points, 41 and 50,
respectively, so we can highlight the effect of measurement error in
network reconstruction.

4.1.] Linear interactions Here, we use (2) and (4) to generate
a synthetic data set with G: 16 and T=41. We set the network
connectivity p80.13 and produced a layered network: a hub gene
is perturbed by an (unmeasured) external input, the signal is then
propagated to a second layer of genes with another hub which, in
turn, propagates the signal to a third layer. A small amount of links
feeding forward and backward between layers are also included.
Expression proﬁles can be found in Supplementary Figure Sla.
This dataset is regarded as the ‘noiseless’ case. Using it as
basis, we generated noisy replicates according to (4) with 17:, either
Gaussian (GD) or Student (SD) distributed. For each distribution, we
generated two datasets: one with few (R = 4) and a second with many
(R = 20) replicates. In both cases, we consider rather noisy scenarios

by setting 18—1/2 at 50% of the maximum absolute expression value
of each gene (note that in the GD case, ‘Eg corresponds to the
measurement precision). We ﬁxed 1): 5, for the Student-t case.

We ﬁtted three models to each dataset: one where the measurement
error is assumed to be Student distributed (SM), the second assumes
normal errors (GM) and the third disregards measurement error by
taking the mean of the replicates as the true time series (MM). To
summarize the results of the inference on the network topology,
we use two threshold-independent scores: the area under the ROC
curve (AUC) and mean cross entropy (M XE). The AUC provides
an overall accuracy measure of network retrieval, using the link
predictions sorted according to their magnitude. It thus fails to
account for the strength in the predictions; in our case, the estimated
link probabilities. These are key as, when performing inference
on an unknown network, we will normally set a threshold above
which links will be predicted as being present. For this reason, we
also calculate the M><E deﬁned as the average Kullback—Leibler

divergence from the link structure of the true network to the posterior
link probabilities, over all possible links (detailed in Supplementary
Section 4. 1 S). As a baseline for comparison, the M ><E of a perfectly
inferred network is 0 and that of one predicted totally at random
(i.e. probability of 1/2 for each link) is —log(1/2) 80.7. In the case
of the AUC, this corresponds to values of 1 and 1/2, respectively.
For instance, we ﬁtted the AR(l) model with the ideal, noiseless
data, resulting in an AUC of 0.99 and a M><E of 0.05.

When using GD, GM and SM perform equally well under both
criteria—see the corresponding columns of Table 1. This is to be
expected, since a Student distribution with large degrees of freedom
approaches a Gaussian. Using a small number of replicates (R = 4 in
Table 1) GM and SM outperform MM in either criteria. When a large
number of replicates is considered (R = 20 in Table 1), the AUC for
all three scenarios are quite close, indicating a similar ordering of
the estimated link probabilities for all models ﬁtted. However, the
M ><E scores are better for SM and GM, highlighting that the inferred
probabilities with measurement error are comparatively higher for
existent links and lower for non-existent.

Regarding inference on data with Student error, MM performs
worse under both scores—ﬁrst row in Table 1. In fact, the M X E score
with few replicates is very close to that of random predictions. SM
shows a small improvement over GM for both small and large R. This
difference is slightly larger for R=20, illustrating that the degrees
of freedom are hard to estimate; four replicates is barely enough to
infer them, while R :20 allows for a more precise estimation.

The effect of measurement error can also be highlighted when
concentrating on the data with several replicates (columns with
R=20 in Table 1), while relative differences in the AUC between
MM and SM are reduced to <2% for GD and 11% for SD, relative
differences in M><E are 17% and 28%, respectively. This can be
understood since attenuation reduces with increased number of
replicates and, therefore, the point estimates of the coefﬁcients from
either model will be closer to each other, resulting in a similar AUC.
However, the variance of these estimates will still be underestimated
when using MM and as a result the M><E, which takes into account
the actual value of the estimated probabilities, will capture these
differences.

Attenuation and underestimation of the variability on the
coefﬁcients estimates are illustrated in Figure 1 for a speciﬁc
link, gene12 —> geneg. As expected in the ideal, noiseless case, the
posterior distribution of the corresponding coefﬁcient, 51239, has
its mode close to the true value of the coefﬁcient (1.0) and has a

rather large precision. With noisy measurements MM renders an
attenuated coefﬁcient, with its posterior distribution shifted towards
the origin (dashed curve). Moreover, the corresponding posterior
has negligible mass near the true value. In contrast, the posterior
from SM overlaps nicely (solid). Also, the MM estimate has a
posterior precision of about 72, larger than the SM, 62, illustrating
the underestimation of the uncertainty in the coefﬁcient estimate.
This effect was observed more or less markedly in all predicted
links (not shown).

4.1.2 Nonlinear interactions A dataset with nonlinear
interactions was generated using a gene network model built
with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The network is
a mathematical model of the A.thaliana circadian clock and
consists of G=5 genes with eight links, and also includes protein
production and transport, as well as daylight (Locke et al., 2006).
We generated data from this model using COPASI (Hoops et al.,
2006) with the light source ﬁxed permanently on. To mimic
realistic sampling regimes, we sub-sampled the data so as to have
a time spacing of an hour and then took logs. The resulting time
series has a total of T=50 time points (plots of the proﬁles are
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1Sb). This is the ‘noiseless’ dataset.
We generate noistZreplicates using Student distributed errors. As
before, we ﬁx ‘5; / at 50% of the maximum value of the noiseless
gene expression, use 11:5 and produced two datasets: one with 4
replicates and the other with 20 replicates.

Due to the small size and high connectivity of the network
0080.40), the scores used in the previous example become quite
sensitive. This is because the ROC is a piecewise constant function
and with a small number of genes (and therefore links), the size of
the steps becomes larger and thus comparisons get more sensitive.
For improved interpretability, we plot in Figure 2 the links included
in the predicted network against the posterior link probability when
ﬁtting the data with R=4 replicates. We use a circle (cross) for
an incorrect (correct) link; for instance, in the noiseless case the
predicted network using a threshold of 0.95 would have nine links
(circles and crosses with link probability threshold above 0.95 in
Fig. 2a), four out of which (crosses) are correct.

Inspection of the inferred link probabilities using the noiseless
data (Fig. 2a), shows that there is some overﬁtting. For instance,

Link amt-abill'iy thrashoii: Link probability tresnold

Fig. 2. Network topology retrieval for the ODE circadian clock in silica
dataset with R=4 replicates. Links predicted to be present in the network

using MM, GM and SM. A link (not) present in the ODE model is shown
with a (circle) cross.

using a link probability threshold of 0.7, 14 out of 20 possible links
are predicted to be present. The main reason for this is that the linear
model is unable to explain the nonlinear interactions adequately,
resulting in either a misprediction or a compensation by the inclusion
of spurious parents (see Morrissey et al., submitted for publication,
for a detailed discussion).

For the case where we have few replicates, GM and SM
outperform MM (Fig. 2b—d). MM predicts only two links with
high probability (39,7 30.8), both incorrect. For a link probability
threshold of 0.7, GM performs marginally better than SM (even
though the true noise is Student). Using a threshold of 0.5, the
inferred network would be the same for both models, though. If
we compare model ﬁt for low thresholds, MM predicts 17 links not
present in the network with a threshold of 0.2 (i.e. those crosses
and circles to the left of 0.2). Seven out of these are real (crosses);
i.e. it has a high false negative rate, compared to the models with
measurement error: 4 out of 10 for GM and 3 out of 9 with SM.
Moreover, the true positive rate for this (low) threshold is 1 out of 3
for MM (one cross and two circles to the right of 0.2), while GM has
4 out of 10 and SM 5 out of 1 1 . When a large number of replicates are
available, the three models yield similar network reconstructions;
however, the spread of posterior link probabilities is still more
concentrated when using MM (see Supplementary Fig. S3).

The effect of attenuation in network retrieval can be seen by
comparing Figure 2b to Figure 2c and d. Most posterior link
probabilities of MM are tightly clustered towards zero; this is due
in part to the combined effect of attenuated coefﬁcients (and thus a
lower overall connectivity) and the underestimation of the variability
on these estimates (the tight grouping). In contrast, the posterior link

probabilities in either GM or SM have a wider spread reﬂecting both
the larger estimates of the coefﬁcients and the increased variability
in the estimates when considering measurement error.

4.2 In viva data

We used a microarray time series of gene expression proﬁles from
A. thaliana (Denby,K.J. unpublished data). Sampling is destructive,
with a different plant used for each time-replicate. To reduce
variability, the same leaf was used for each sample. A total of 96
plants were grown under a 16 h : 8 h light : dark cycle and the seventh
leaf to emerge from each of R :4 plants was sampled every 2 h over
a 48-h period, i.e. T=24.

To select those genes to be included in the analysis, we referred
to the current working model of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis
(Robertson and Webb, 2009), sketched in Figure 3a. Recently, a
new gene (CHE) was identiﬁed as a member of the core circadian
clock (Pruneda-Paz et al., 2009), so we include this gene to entertain
the most up-to-date version of the clock. Two nodes in Figure 3a
(LHY/CCA1 and PRR7/PRR9) represent pairs of genes that perform
the same role and have very similar expression proﬁles. To avoid
collinearity, a single gene to represent each pair was selected. PRR7
is chosen over PRR9 as it shows a higher signal to noise ratio
and CCA1 over LHY given that CHE is predicted to regulate
CCA1 and not LHY (traces of the expression proﬁles are shown
in Supplementary Fig. 2S).

Figure 4 depicts the distribution of the inferred link probabilities
for each of the three models. As there are few links predicted with
high probability, we set a link probability threshold of 0.5. Figure 3
shows the inferred networks for this threshold. GM and MM infer
the same network topology, whereas SM infers a network with six
links, only two of them in common with the GM/MM network.

This large difference is explained by the posterior probability
distribution of the degrees of freedom (Fig. 5), where four out of
the ﬁve genes are inferred to have a fat-tailed measurement error
distribution, with a mode of v = 3 for PRR7. The effect of attenuation
in the estimation of the link probabilities is illustrated by comparing
the three pictures on Figure 4. Again, the majority of probabilities
estimated by MM are smaller than those estimated by either GM
or SM and are more tightly grouped. On the other hand, GM and
SM reﬂect the additional uncertainty in the measurement process by
dragging these probabilities towards the centre of the plot.

The GM/MM network correctly predicts the TOC1—>GI—>TOC1
loop, but also predicts two incorrect links (GI—>CCA1 and
TOC1—>PRR7). The SM model also correctly predicts TOC1—>GI
but incorrectly TOC1—>PRR7. The other four links that are absent
in the GM/MM predicted network involve either PRR7 (three
links) or CCA1 (one) as a regulator. Out of these, there are
two correct predictions: PRR7—>CCA1, CCA1—>TOC1 and two
incorrect: PRR7—>GI and PRR7—>TOC1.

Noteworthy is the discrepancy between the SM and MM/GM
inferred networks (Fig. 3). The fact that for the given threshold the
MM and GM inferred networks are the same illustrates the effect
of outliers in the estimation: when using GM, despite taking into
account the uncertainty in the replicates through 1g, these are treated
as interchangeable in the update of yt (in this case, (042,2 1). In
contrast, the weights in SM depend on the degrees of freedom and
will be more variable for smaller values of 1), allowing for some
of the measurements to dominate the average. To verify that this is

indeed the case, we ﬁtted the AR(1) model using the median value
of the replicates as the sole source of information. The predicted
network topology (not shown) also has six links with only one of
them differing from those inferred by SM (incorrect in both cases);

nevertheless, the posterior distribution of the link probabilities was
tighter, illustrating the sub-estimation of the coefﬁcients’ precision.

These comparisons are dependant on the threshold selected and
as such are only a point estimate of the network. As described
in the Section 1, the fundamental effect of not accounting for
repeated measurements is the overconﬁdence in the estimation of
the coefﬁcients and its effect on the estimates of link probabilities.
Even though the topology retrieved from MM and GM, for a
ﬁxed threshold, is similar, the distribution of the link probabilities
is extremely different. MM predicts three links with very high
probability (>08) and 14 with very low probability (<0.2), with
only three in the central region of Figure 4a. In contrast, GM predicts
only 1 link with high probability and 10 with low, leaving 9 possible
links in the central zone of Figure 4b. The conclusions obtained from
either model can thus be quite distinct, while MM suggests a high
conﬁdence in its predictions, GM correctly warns about the high
levels of uncertainty in the recovery of the network.

Interestingly, no parents or children are predicted for the new
clock gene CHE. Pruneda-Paz et al. (2009) showed that CHE can

bind TOC1 and also binds the promoter region of CCA1. This
suggests that we can expect non-additive, nonlinear effects that
may be difﬁcult to capture with an additive linear model. For
the regulation of CHE, we do not expect these problems. From
Pruneda—Paz et al. (2009), we know that CHE is regulated by
CCA1. Analysing the SM posterior link probabilities, we found that
the other four genes appear as regulators of CHE with posterior
probabilities of around 0.13, suggesting that either the regulation is
highly nonlinear, or there are other regulatory mechanisms such as
post-translational modiﬁcations. The latter would not be unlikely as
it is well known that targeted protein degradation and sequestration
plays a very important role in the circadian clock.

We further explored the effect of having less replicates available.
To this end, we sub-sampled the original four replicate dataset and
generated 60 datasets, 30 with three replicates and 30 with one.
The datasets were sampled in a controlled manner to ensure they
were not too similar to the original four replicate dataset (see
Supplementary Section 4.35).

We summarize the information by setting the same link probability
threshold as in the four replicate case (39,; 30.5), and then counted
the times a link was predicted to be present. These counts are shown
in Table 2 for the l-replicate case and Table 3 for the 3-replicate.
As expected, the ‘no replicates’ scenario (Table 2) shows high
variability in the inferred networks. No single link was predicted
as present in more than half the datasets. A third of the predicted
networks had no more than one predicted link and a further third
of the networks had from four to six predicted links (not shown).
Three links appeared more frequently than the rest: the two link
loop TOC1—>GI—> TOC1 and the PRR7—>TOC1 link. The two links
in the loop were predicted together only in ﬁve of the datasets,
reﬂecting the loss in estimation precision when no replicates are
available.

As there is only one replicate per gene, the model without measurement error is used.
Genes in columns are regulators and rows are regulatees.

Table 3 illustrates the beneﬁts of including repeated
measurements: there is a clear separation in the link prediction
frequency, with a few links being predicted quite frequently and the
rest barely appearing. Those links predicted in more than half of the
datasets (highlighted in Table 3) are consistent with those predicted
using the full dataset. Links predicted by MM are exactly the same
as those with the full data (see Fig. 3). Compared to SM, GM
incorrectly swaps TOC1—>GI for PRR7—>GI while SM misses two
links (TOC1—>GI and PRR7—>TOC1), but is still able to correctly
predict two further links (CCA1—>TOC1 and PRR7—>CCA1). This
shows that even in the case when less data is available, SM is still
able to infer the degrees of freedom and outperforms MM/GM. In
a scenario where few replicates and time points are available, it
may be advisable to modify SM making the degrees of freedom
common to all genes.

5 DISCUSSION

We demonstrate here that the uncertainty conveyed in repeated
measurements of time course gene expression data can have a strong
effect when estimating a gene interaction network. In the case of a
linear autoregressive network speciﬁcation, not accounting for this
uncertainty leads to attenuation of the autoregressive coefﬁcients
and overestimation of the precision of these estimates. This in turn
can affect the network topology retrieval. To address this issue, we
propose a model that explicitly includes this variability.

Our modelling is fully Bayesian, with the true gene expression
unobserved and thus inferred. Inference of these expression values
draws information from both the surrogate measurements and the
linear AR(l) process assumed for the gene network interaction,
with the inﬂuence of each source weighted by the relative value
of the AR( 1) precision, A, and the measurement precision, ‘l' . When
1' is relatively small, inference on the expression values will be
predominately determined by the AR(l) part of the model. In the
case where there is little information in the data about the regulatory
process, the prior on A must thence be carefully elicited. We provide
a benchmark prior for the kinds of datasets arising from microarrays.

Our model accommodates simultaneous inference of the network
topology along with the interaction coefﬁcients. We showed that
attenuation of the network coefﬁcients as well as the underestimation
of the variability of these estimates is systematic. Such behaviour
is then passed on to the estimated link probabilities, yielding a
more concentrated distribution of link probabilities towards either
one or zero. The retrieved networks are obtained by setting an
(arbitrary) threshold on the posterior link probabilities, and thus

are only point estimates of the network topology. Thus, the ﬁnal
effect on the inferred network topology is case dependant. This is
because, while searching for regulatory dependencies, the estimation
process implicitly compares alternative parenthood conﬁgurations
and the inclusion/exclusion of a link depends on the speciﬁc
dynamics of each gene and its relative variability. However, the
distribution of these probabilities can be quite different, providing
the experimentalists with a more accurate description of the
uncertainty contained in the model ﬁtting, and thus will be better
informed when designing further experiments.

High-throughput technologies yield noisy measurements, with the
noise distribution typically exhibiting heavier than Gaussian tails.
Not accounting for this behaviour can also have a negative impact
when performing inference on the interaction coefﬁcients of the
network. In our examples, we showed that the inferred topology
with the synthetic datasets improved when using SM over GM and
MM. Even though there is not a deﬁnite network as yet for the in viva
dataset, the inferred topology showed no difference between MM
and GM for the selected threshold, while the posterior distributions
of the degrees of freedom indicate heavy tails for all but one of the
genes, indicating signiﬁcant outliers in the data and thus suggesting
the MM/GM predictions are questionable.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The increasing availability of experimentally determined
binding affinities for drugs on multiple protein targets requires the
design of specific mining and visualization tools that graphically
integrate chemical and biological data in an efficient environment.
With this aim, we developed iPHACE, an integrative web-based tool
to navigate in the pharmacological space defined by small molecule
drugs contained in the IUPHAR-DB, with additional interactions
present in PDSP. Extending beyond traditional querying and filtering
tools, iPHACE offers a means to extract knowledge from the target
profile of drugs as well as from the drug profile of protein targets.
Availability: iPHACE is available at http://cgl.imim.es/iphace/ (EU
site) and http://agave.health.unm.edu/iphace/ (US mirror)

1 INTRODUCTION

The perception that drugs bind selectively to only a few biological
targets has been largely biased by the limited time and resources
devoted to the systematic screening of compounds against a large
panel of proteins. Recent efforts towards generating, compiling
and storing pharmacological data for drugs are challenging this
traditional perception, as most drugs appear to have a rich
polypharmacology (Mestres et a1., 2009). In this respect, data
repositories such as the Psychoactive Drug Screening Program
(PDSP; Roth et a1., 2004), DrugBank (Wishart et a1., 2008),
IUPHAR-DB (Harmar et a1., 2009) and PubChem (Wang et a1.,
2009) have become essential public resources that provide up-to-
date information on the binding afﬁnity proﬁle of drugs.

The increasing amount of available data on drug—target
interactions brings on the need to develop new interactive tools for
data integration and mining that can facilitate knowledge extraction.
All the above databases offer, via individual web sites, the possibility
to perform some degree of querying and ﬁltering to enable data
access. In addition, other resources such as SEA (Keiser et a1.,
2007), SuperTarget (Gunther et a1., 2008), STITCH (Kuhn et a1.,
2008) and DrugViz (Xiong et a1., 2008) provide purposely designed
tools to analyse and visualize drug—target relationships. Along these
lines, iPHACE represents a new integrative conceptual framework
to navigate in the pharmacological space covered by drugs. The
current release contains 4089 interactions between 739 drugs and

181 targets [147 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and 34 ion
channels] extracted from IUPHAR-DB and PDSP.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Database processing: database implementation in iPHACE requires
that all data are provided as a standard structure data ﬁle (SDF)
with pre-deﬁned ﬁelds under a common format (e.g. TargetName,
pActivity, ActivityDescriptor, AfﬁnityType and Species). These
SDFs are then processed to generate unique drug and target
identiﬁers and to compute molecular descriptors. All information
is ultimately parsed and added to a mysql database that currently
contains 2122 interactions between 739 drugs and 140 targets from
IUPHAR-DB, supplemented by 3009 interactions between 330 of
those drugs and 121 targets from PDSP. This mysql database is
managed by a php script that pre-generates all php and html pages
displayed by the iPHACE navigator, as well as all chemical structure
images, descriptor histograms and supplementary information
resulting from ﬁltering and searching actions. ChemAxon applets are
used for chemical structure depiction and for substructure searches.

Classiﬁcation schemes: drug space is organized using a six-
level structural hierarchy (Cases et a1., 2005): the top three levels
are integers representing the number of rings in the largest ring
system, the number of ring systems and the number of bonds
connecting the most distant ring systems in the structure; the
remaining three levels are hash-codes that uniquely identify the
atomic framework, the scaffold and ﬁnally the molecule (Fig. 1).
Target space is organized using standard ﬁinctional classiﬁcations
schemes available for GPCRs and ion channels (Garcia-Sema et a1.,
2006).

Working areas: the iPHACE navigator is divided into four main
working areas (Fig. 1). The top-left area contains the classiﬁcation
schemes used to organize Drug and Target spaces. The top-right
area is used to show the Interaction map and the Structural browser.
One can switch between the two using the control buttons present
in the top-left area. The bottom-left area is reserved for Text and
Substructure searches and to apply Filters to identify drugs with
similar activity proﬁles within a user-deﬁned cutoff. The similarity
between the activity proﬁles of two drugs having afﬁnity for
N targets is obtained by computing the Euclidean distance between
the respective afﬁnity vectors relative to the maximum Euclidean
distance found for a pair of drugs in the set having afﬁnity for
N targets. Finally, the bottom-right area depicts the Descriptor
proﬁle; descriptors can be selected from a pull-down menu. All four
working areas are interconnected. Browsing on the Drug and Target
spaces will automatically rebuild the corresponding Interaction map
and Descriptor proﬁle areas.

3 APPLICATIONS

Depending on their background, different users might ﬁnd different
utility for iPHACE. This is a list of potential scenarios, with common
questions and how they can be addressed within iPHACE:

(i) What is the target space associated with drugs having activity
data for the Muscarinic 1 receptor? Go to Text Search and type
‘muscarinic’. Click on ‘MUSCARINIC 1’. The resulting Interaction
map shows that there are 79 drugs with activity data for the
muscarinic 1 receptor; for some of these drugs, there is activity
data related to 87 additional targets. To focus on high-activity
interactions, expressed as -log(molar), the user can change the
activity threshold placed above the Interaction map.

(ii) What is the target space associated with drugs having a
piperazine substructure? Go to Substructure search, click on the little
rectangle, draw a piperazine, close the applet and click on the search
icon. The resulting interaction map shows that there are 63 drugs
containing a piperazine substructure with activity data for 74 targets.
Most interestingly, 56 of those drugs (88.9%) have activity data
for class A amine GPCRs. Only 43.0% of the entire drug set have
activity data on those receptors, which conﬁrms that piperazine is a
privileged substructure for drugs acting on amine GPCRs (Klabunde
and Hessler, 2002).

(iii) Which are the drugs having the most similar activity proﬁle
to chlorpromazine? Go to Text Search and type ‘chlorpromazine’.
Mark the box next to the drug name. Go then to Filters, click on the
box next to proﬁle similarity and apply ﬁltering. An interaction map
between eight drugs and 51 targets appears, drugs being ordered (top
to bottom) according to their activity proﬁle similarity with respect
to chlorpromazine. The activity proﬁle of each drug can be accessed
by clicking on the name of the drug. A right-mouse click brings you
back to the Interaction map. The structures of these eight drugs can
be inspected by clicking on the ‘8 molecules’ link present in the
Drug space working area. Note that despite the structural variety of
these drugs, they are all classiﬁed as anti-psychotics.

4 CONCLUSION

The iPHACE navigator was designed to enable a multidisciplinary
team of drug discovery scientists to visually process information on

chemical structures and biological activities of drugs in an efﬁcient,
organized and integrative manner. As more data on the interaction of
drugs with multiple targets become available, tools such as iPHACE
are likely to deepen our understanding of both the polypharmacology
of drugs and the cross-pharmacology of targets.

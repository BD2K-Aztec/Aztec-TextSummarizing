ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has revolutionized
gene regulation studies and is now fundamental for the detection
of protein—DNA and protein—RNA binding, as well as for measuring
RNA expression. With increasing variety and sequencing depth of
HTS datasets, the need for more flexible and memory-efficient tools
to analyse them is growing.

Results: We describe Pyicos, a powerful toolkit for the analysis
of mapped reads from diverse HTS experiments: ChlP-Seq, either
punctuated or broad signals, CLIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. We prove the
effectiveness of Pyicos to select for significant signals and show
that its accuracy is comparable and sometimes superior to that of
methods specifically designed for each particular type of experiment.
Pyicos facilitates the analysis of a variety of HTS datatypes through
its flexibility and memory efficiency, providing a useful framework for
data integration into models of regulatory genomics.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression is regulated through a complex network of
protein interactions with RNA and DNA. Recent advances in high-
throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies provide a very effective
way to obtain information about these interactions at genome-wide
level at reasonable cost. ChIP-Seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by HTS) has become the preferred method for current
analysis of transcriptional regulation in viva, since it provides
genome-wide coverage at a high sensitivity and signal-to-noise
ratio (Johnson et (11., 2007; Robertson et (11., 2007). However, to
unravel the complete gene expression network, it is also necessary
to systematically identify protein—RNA interactions in cells. HITS-
CLIP or CLIP-Seq (cross-linking immunoprecipitation followed by

HTS) provides a powerful mean to obtain global information about
direct protein—RNA interactions in cells (Licatalosi et (11., 2008;
Xue et (11., 2009). Additionally, the RNA-Seq experiments provide a
way to measure RNA levels at a higher sensitivity and coverage
than microarray experiments. Despite the inherent biases, RNA-
Seq can overcome some of the array limitations and provides the
possibility to measure alternative splicing events (Fan et (11., 2008;
Wang et (11., 2008a) or expression levels (Pepke et (11., 2009; Trapnell
et (11., 2010), to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (Wang
et (11., 2008b) and to discover novel genes (Khalil et (11., 2009).
Short-read sequencing platforms such as Illumina are very suitable
for the study of protein—DNA and protein—RNA interactions, since
they can produce enough data to perform accurate quantitative
analysis. Furthermore, the resulting reads are of sufﬁcient length
to be mapped accurately to a reference sequence, but short enough
to deﬁne the interaction sites with enough precision. However,
not all interactions can be detected at the same coverage. For
instance, transcription factors produce generally a Clearly localized,
or punctuated, signal (Park, 2009), whereas histone marks or RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) produce broad signals, covering more
extended regions (Park, 2009). Most of the tools published for the
analysis of ChIP-Seq data focus on punctuated signals (Fejes et (11.,
2008; Nix et (11., 2008; Park, 2009; Pepke et (11., 2009; Zhang et (11.,
2008), with only few methods devoted to analyse broad signals
(Shin et (11., 2009; Zang et (11., 2009). However, these methods are
not readily applicable to other HTS datatypes, like CLIP-Seq or
RNA-Seq, making it necessary to incorporate additional tools to
perform gene regulation studies, which generally involve multiple
HTS experiments. The increase in variety and sequencing depth
of such experiments, as well as the growing need for memory-
efﬁcient tools that can be applied to various datatypes, motivated
us to develop Pyicos.

In this article, we describe Pyicos, a versatile toolkit operating
on short HTS reads that have already been mapped to a
reference coordinate system, like a genome or a transcriptome. We
demonstrate its accuracy on punctuated ChIP-Seq data comparing
it to MACS (Zhang et (11., 2008), FindPeaks (Fejes et (11., 2008)
and USeq (Nix et (11., 2008), using published ChIP-Seq datasets. We
also describe the accuracy of Pyicos enrichment analysis (EA) to
detect differentially expressed (DE) genes from RNA-Seq data by
comparing it with the Bioconductor packages DEGseq (Wang et (11.,
2010), DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010) and edgeR (Robinson et (11.,
2010) using published RNA-Seq data and microarray experiments
on the same samples. Furthermore, we illustrate the ﬂexibility of

Pyicos by showing its effectiveness on other HTS datatypes: broad
ChIP-Seq signals and CLIP-Seq data. Finally, we also discuss the
performance of Pyicos in terms of memory usage and CPU time.

Pyicos provides different protocols to deﬁne signiﬁcant signals
from ChIP-Seq (both punctuated and broad), CLIP-Seq and RNA-
Seq data; and all operations can be applied independently or
combined in a protocol ﬁle, which makes Pyicos useful for the
integrative analysis of a wide variety of HTS data. Moreover,
the software has a modular architecture that allows re-usability in
other Python applications. Pyicos thus offers a useﬁil framework to
facilitate the analysis of a variety of HTS datatypes, providing the
basis for data integration into gene regulation studies.

2 METHODS

Pyicos is written in Python and is available under the GNU General Public
License. It can operate from the command line or as a software library within
Python programs (tested on GNU/Linux Fedora 12 and MAC OSX). All
operations can be used independently and the parameters can be set by the
user; thus providing as much ﬂexibility as possible. Additionally, Pyicos
can be run using protocols ﬁles (Supplementary Fig. $1 and Supplementary
Material), which allows the user to apply them directly for standard analyses
or to design customized workﬂows.

Pyicos has its own compressed format for peaks as explained in the
Supplementary Material. This is also used as an internal representation for
read clusters, and can be used as input and output formats. Furthermore,
Pyicos can handle other various formats, providing converter capabilities.
It can read eland, SAM, BED and wiggle (ﬁxed and variable step); and
write to SAM, BED and wiggle (ﬁxed and variable step). Some formats
are obligatory for some of the operations, which are speciﬁed in the
corresponding command help.

2.1 Callpeaks protocol

The callpeaks protocol is applied to punctuated ChIP-Seq data and starts
by optionally removing duplicated reads, i.e. redundant reads in terms of
position and strand in a genome. Next, all reads that fall into a set of regions
speciﬁed by the user, such as satellites and pericentromeric regions, are
removed, as they generally lead to false positives (FPS). Reads are extended
to the expected initial fragment size, given as input. Alternatively, Pyicos
can also estimate this extension using a shift correlation analysis (Zhang
et (11., 2008). Next, reads are grouped into read clusters according to genomic
overlap. To follow standard nomenclature, for punctuated data we will refer
to read clusters as peaks. When a control experiment is available, callpeaks
normalizes the sample with respect to control and subtracts the proﬁle of the
control from that of the sample with nucleotide resolution (Supplementary
Material). At this stage, callpeaks removes two possible artefacts: peaks
that are shorter than a certain length (100 nt by default), which may be
produced by the subtraction step; and block-like peaks, which may occur
when duplicates are kept. This removal is optional to the user. Pyicos also
includes a split operation, which allows exploring the possibility that some
peaks may describe multiple binding sites. Finally, callpeaks calculates the
signiﬁcance for a peak to correspond to a real binding site using Poisson
analysis applied to three different parameters: the peak height, the number of
reads per peak and the number of reads per nucleotide. For each chromosome,
a P-Value is calculated independently for each of these parameters. We also
deﬁne a peak score as a combination of the Poisson P-Value and the peak
parameter P: peak score: [P—log10(P-Value)]/2, for P equal to either the
peak height or the peak read count.

2.2 Benchmarking of callpeaks

We compared Pyicos with MACS (Zhang et (11., 2008) version 1.3.7.1,
FindPeaks (Fejes et (11., 2008) version 3.3 and USeq (Nix et (11., 2008)

version 7.2, using ChIP-Seq datasets for four different factors: the insulator
(CTCF) in K562 cells (ENCODE Consortium, 2011), the CCAAT/enhancer-
binding protein alpha (CEBPA) in liver cells (Schmidt et (11., 2010),
the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) in Jurkat T cells (Johnson,
Mortazavi, et (11., 2007) and the progesterone receptor (PR) in T47D cells
(Vicent et (11., 2011). We have used various measures to evaluate the quality
of peak deﬁnition on the punctuated ChIP-Seq data. Two of the descriptors of
the peak deﬁnition used are the peak length and the distance between the peak
centre and summit, i.e. the position with the highest read pileup. We further
compared the rankings of the peaks provided by each method: the peak
score (Pyicos), the peak height (FindPeaks), the value of — 10 - log 10(P-Value)
(MACS) and the ranking provided by USeq.

For the accuracy evaluation, we also used the 83 positive and 30 negative
regions validated by ChIP-qPCR for NRSF (Mortazavi et (11., 2006) as
done in Johnson et a1. (2007). Since peaks differ a lot in their extensions
(Supplementary Fig. S2), we took a region of 100 nt centred on the summit
as the predicted binding region. We classiﬁed the peaks from each method
as true positives (TPs) and FPS depending on whether the 100 nt long region
centred on the summit overlapped a positive or negative validated region,
respectively. The true positive rate (TPR) was calculated as TP over the
total number of positive regions and the false positive rate (FPR) was
calculated as FP over the total number of negative regions. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated using incremental subsets of
peaks along the ranked peaks from each method, with increasing subset
sizes of 500 peaks.

An additional measure of the quality of the predictions is the fraction of
peaks associated to the expected motif (J i at (11., 2008; Zhang 21111., 2008). We
thus measured the fraction of peaks with motif occurrence in the sequence
underlying the summit, considering 100 nt for NRSF and PR peaks and 200 nt
for CEBPA and CTCF peaks. For the motif analysis, we scanned the selected
sequences from the peaks using the matrices for NRSF, CTCF, CEBPA
and the three available matrices for PR from TRANSFAC (Kniippel et (11.,
1994) (accession numbers: M00256, M01200, M00116. M00954. M00957.
M00960) using a custom script. We used as core similarity cut-off 0.99 and
as total similarity cut-off 0.85. As the summit of a peak is associated more
strongly with the binding motif than the peak centre (Supplementary Fig. S3),
we considered it as a suitable reference position. Additionally, we used as
fourth descriptor the spatial resolution, i.e. the distance from the summit
position to the centre of the detected motif.

Finally, for all four ChIP-Seq datasets, we considered the Pyicos rankings
using both the peak height and read count scores. For further analyses, we
selected the score that gives the best motif content in top-scoring peaks: the
peak height score for PR and CEBPA, and the read count score for CTCF
and NRSF.

2.3 Enrichment protocol

Pyicos incorporates a method to calculate the signiﬁcance of the enrichment
of the signal between two samples based on the comparison with the
distribution of enrichment values on the same regions for experimental
or theoretical replicas, similarly to the methods MATR and MARS from
DEGseq (Wang et (11., 2010). Using subsets of ~5% of neighbouring data
points along the axis of average densities A, the enrichment values M
calculated for genes between RNA-Seq samples for two liver replicas from
Marioni et a1. (2008) follow a normal distribution (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Accordingly, Pyicos uses a sliding window along the A axis and calculates
a Z-score for the enrichment M of each region from the comparison of the
replicas (details in Supplementary Material). The region is assigned to a
background window according to proximity: the region is compared with
the values of the window which centre is closest to the region in terms of
the value of A. If no replicas are provided, theoretical replicas are created
by randomly rearranging the reads into two subsets, taking into account the
relative sizes of the original samples. We integrated the TMM normalization
(Robinson and Oshlack, 2010) in Pyicos EA. The calculation of the TMM
factor on our read count lists yielded a value of 0.68 for liver versus kidney

Pyicos

 

and a value of 1.01 for the comparison of the two liver replicas, which agrees
with the results reported in Robinson and Oshlack (2010).

Pyicos EA can have read counts or reads per kilobase per million reads
(RPKM) (Mortazavi et (11., 2008) as input; or alternatively, directly the BED
ﬁles with regions and read coordinates, overcoming the need of an additional
tool to count reads. Additionally, Pyicos can calculate enriched regions de
novo by scanning the samples provided, using two conﬁgurable parameters,
the proximity between two reads to be taken as part of the same region, and
the minimum number of reads in the region to be considered.

2.4 Benchmarking of EA

To assess the accuracy of Pyicos in the prediction of DE genes, we compared
it to three other methods, DEGseq (Wang et (11., 2010), DESeq (Anders and
Huber, 2010) and edgeR (Robinson et (11., 2010); using published datasets
for RNA-Seq and equivalent microarray experiments for liver and kidney
samples (Marioni et (11., 2008). FirSt, we mapped the microarray results to
the Ensembl annotation (Flicek et (11., 2011). Then, using the microarray
data, we deﬁned a benchmarking set composed of DE and non-DE genes.
DE genes were deﬁned to have False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.001 and an
absolute logz-fold change >O.5 (Marioni et (11., 2008), regardless of whether
they are up- or down-regulated. Non-DE genes were deﬁned to have an FDR
>0.01 and an absolute logz-fold change of at most 0.5. This benchmarking
set is composed of 6700 DE genes and 7060 non-DE genes. To predict
DE genes, we considered for each Ensembl locus the mean of the values
for read counts or RPKM for the corresponding Ensembl transcripts in the
locus. The RPKM and read count per transcript were calculated with reads
falling within the exons of each transcript. A pseudocount of one read per
transcript was added to be able to operate with transcripts whose exonS did
not have any reads in any of the samples. We estimated the TPS and FPS aS
the number of predicted DE (enriched or depleted) genes that were annotated
aS DE or non-DE genes in the benchmarking set, respectively. ROC curveS
were calculated by considering increasing absolute values of the Z-Score
or —log10(P-Value) for the predictions for each method. We also calculated
precisionirecall curveS along Z-Score thresholds, where precision iS the ratio
of TP over the number of predicted caseS and recall iS the same aS the TPR.

2.5 Enrichment on ChIP-Seq data

We performed EA on broad ChIP-Seq Signals uSing ENCODE data for
H3K36me3 and RNAPII, and correlated the results to the enrichment of
RNA-Seq data, for the K562 and NHEK cellS (ENCODE Consortium,
2011). The calculation of Signiﬁcantly enriched or depleted regions waS
based on RPKM values. Replicas 1 and 2 from K562 and replica 1 from
NHEK were used to calculate enrichment on three different types of regions
from the Ensembl annotation (Flicek et (11., 2011): for H3K36me3 we used
the transcript-body, Spanning from the transcription Start Site (TSS) to the
transcription termination Site (TTS); for RNAPII we used a window of
4kb around the TSS; and the transcript exons for RNA-Seq, aS before.
Signiﬁcant regions were deﬁned aS those with an absolute Z-Score >10. We
calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient of Z-ScoreS from Signiﬁcant
regions between H3K36me3 and RNA-Seq, aS well aS between RNAPII and
RNA-Seq.

2.6 Memory usage and running time benchmarking

To teSt the memory usage and running time of the callpeaks protocol, we
used ChIP-Seq data for the human transcription factor CEBPA (Schmidt
et (11., 2010). To Simulate ﬁleS of different SizeS, we ﬁrst pooled together
all available readS and took random subsets with an increasing Size Step of
3 million reads, up to 30 million reads, separately for sample and control. In
each run, we subsampled two random setS of equal Size from the ChIP-Seq
readS and from control, uSing StepS of 3 million readS.

In order to teSt the performance of Pyicos EA, we compared it to DEGSeq
and to a combination of BEDToolS (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) with edgeR
and DESeq, aS these two programs do not accept aS input BED ﬁleS with the

regions of interest and the positions of the mapped readS from the samples
to be compared. In thiS way, all four calculations Start with the same input:
BED ﬁleS for the samples and the region ﬁle. We used the same CEBPA
data mentioned before and we calculated the enrichment in the region of
2 kb upstream of the TSS for RefSeq annotated genes. ThiS time we sampled
twice per run on the experiment, in order to get a Simulated replica, and once
for the control. We sampled readS increasing by 3 million readS in each run.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Analysis of punctuated ChIP-Seq data

The problem of peak detection entails two Challenges: ﬁrst, to
determine signiﬁcant peaks by distinguishing between real and false
binding signal; and secondly, once we have selected the candidate
peaks, we need to properly determine the site of interaction. In
what follows, we use various methods to establish the accuracy
and quality of peak prediction for Pyicos and three other published
methods for punctuated ChIP-Seq analysis. But ﬁrst, we assess
the effectiveness of Pyicos operations for peak deﬁnition using
ChIP-Seq datasets for NRSF, PR, CTCF and CEBPA.

ChIP-Seq analysis often starts by removing duplicated reads,
i.e. redundant reads in terms of position and strand in a genome.
This has been suggested to eliminate ampliﬁcation biases (Zhang
et (11., 2008). We observe that keeping duplicates does not produce
any improvement on the four sets and that, in fact, the highest
fraction of peaks with motifs is achieved when all duplicates are
removed (Supplementary Fig. S5). An additional way to remove
experimental biases, which may introduce FPs, is the use of a
control. When this is available, callpeaks subtracts the control from
the sample after normalization (Supplementary Material). To test
whether Pyicos subtraction improves peak detection, we generated
peaks with and without the subtraction of the control. We observe
a great improvement in peak detection for CEBPA (Fig. 1a), CTCF
and PR (Supplementary Fig. S6), while we only saw a slight increase
for the top peaks for NRSF (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the subtraction of
the control results into almost no difference in the spatial resolution
(Supplementary Fig. S7).

To explore the possibility that some regions of ChIP-Seq signal
may describe multiple binding sites, Pyicos includes the option
to split peaks (Supplementary Material). We found that splitting
peaks showed improvement only on the CTCF dataset, while spatial
resolution was maintained (Supplementary Fig. S8). The protocol
callpeaks incorporates a Poisson test on the retained peaks to select
those that are more likely to be ﬁinctional (Section 2). Although the
Poisson distribution seems not to ﬁt well the background biases of
ChIP-Seq experiments (Zhang et (11., 2008), our analyses indicate
that by subtracting the control we remove these biases and Poisson
analysis can be applied. Each predicted peak is given a peak-score
and a P-value (Section 2). The peak score gives a ranking for all
peaks, whereas the P-value is used to select a subset of candidate
peaks with certain signiﬁcance. In order to show that the peak score
produces an appropriate ranking, we calculated the fraction of peaks
containing the expected motif along ranked peaks. We observe that
for increasing cut-offs of the P-value, the fraction of peaks with
motifs decreases with the peak score (Supplementary Fig. 9). The
selection of candidate peaks by P-value is therefore consistent with
the expected association of signiﬁcant peaks to functional motifs.
The peak score can be calculated using the peak height or read
count. On the one hand, we found no differences in peak quality

height or read count. On the other hand, the peak height score for
PR results into an increased fraction of peaks with motifs relative
to the read count score (Supplementary Fig. S10).

3.2 Comparing peak detection with other methods

In order to ﬁirther assess the quality of Pyicos peak calling, we
compared Pyicos with three other methods: MACS, FindPeaks and
USeq. We evaluated the peak deﬁnition of the four methods in terms
of motif content (Section 2). They all show a similar trend along
the ranking, with Pyicos and MACS showing higher densities for
all ranking positions (Fig. lo and d and Supplementary Fig. S11).
Moreover, calculating the spatial resolution (Section 2), the four
methods show the largest agreement for the PR dataset, whereas
USeq shows the lowest spatial resolution on NRSF, CEBPA and
CTCF (Supplementary Fig. S12).

We also evaluated the accuracy of peak deﬁnition measuring the
overlap of the selected peaks with a benchmarking set of positive and

negative NRSF binding regions validated by ChIP-qPCR (Section
2). All four methods show high agreement for their top 3000 NRSF
peaks in terms of overlap (Supplementary Table S1) and in terms
of the pairwise correlations (Supplementary Table S2); hence, we
expect they would achieve similar accuracies. Indeed, the four
methods perform similarly well with an area under the ROC curve
(AUC) between 0.90 and 0.91 (Table 1). We also compared the
accuracy of peak deﬁnition of the selected peaks by calculating the
distances between summit and peak centre as well as the lengths of
the peaks. We found that USeq, which produces the shortest peaks
(Supplementary Fig. S2), achieves the shortest distance between
summit and peak centre, Closely followed by Pyicos (Supplementary
Fig. S13).

Finally, in order to test our software performance, we used
ChIP-Seq data for the human transcription factor CEBPA (Schmidt
et (11., 2010) (Section 2). Running all four methods with conditions
as similar as possible (Supplementary Material), we observed
that Pyicos is more efﬁcient in memory usage than the other
three methods (Fig. 1e) and stays competitive in running time
(Supplementary Fig. S14).

3.3 EA on RNA-Seq data

Methods to measure differential gene expression from RNA-Seq are
generally based on EA between samples (Anders and Huber, 2010;
Bullard et (11., 2010; Oshlack et (11., 2010; Robinson and Oshlack,
2010; Wang et (11., 2010). Pyicos incorporates a method to detect
regions of signiﬁcant enrichment between two samples based on the
comparison of the observed enrichment values with those measured
between two replicas (Section 2). In order to establish the accuracy
of Pyicos for detecting DE genes, we compared it ﬁrst to the methods
MATR (with replicas) and MARS (without replicas) from DEGseq
(Wang et (11., 2010), using RNA-Seq data from liver and kidney
(Marioni et (11., 2008). Both methods, DEGseq and Pyicos, can
accept as input read counts or RPKM values for each gene; and they
also can estimate a theoretical replica when an experimental one is
not provided. We measured the signiﬁcance of the enrichment of
liver over kidney in all genes using four different combinations of
input data: replicated count, non-replicated count, replicated RPKM
and non-replicated RPKM. Comparing the Z-scores calculated by
Pyicos and DEGseq, we observe a high correlation between both
methods for all the inputs (Supplementary Table 3).

To further estimate the accuracy of Pyicos EA, we also ran DESeq
(Anders and Huber, 2010) and edgeR (Robinson et (11., 2010), on the
same benchmarking sets, using again the four different input types.
Using the microarray experiments from Marioni et (11. (2008), we
created a benchmarking set (Section 2). We found an overall good
performance for Pyicos, with AUCs between 0.791 and 0.813 and
a behaviour similar to DEGseq. All four methods agree similarly
well with the benchmarking set when replicated read count data is
used (Fig. 2a). However, we ﬁnd greater disagreements between

methods and lower accuracy for the other three input combinations
(Supplementary Fig. S15 a—C). Moreover, the precision—recall
curves show a similar level of agreement for replicated read count
data (Fig. 2b) and conﬁrm the good performance of Pyicos for all
combination of inputs (Supplementary Fig. S15 d—f). For DESeq,
it was not possible to make calculations on non-integer values, so
we restricted the calculations to counts, which resulted in a high
AUC when replicas were used. Although edgeR was developed for
replicated count data, it was also run with non-replicated count data
and performed similarly well.

In order to test the memory usage and processing time of Pyicos
EA calculation, we applied EA from all four methods on the CEBPA

dataset to compare the ChIP-Seq sample to the control sample. While
Pyicos and DEGseq can be run directly on BED ﬁles, edgeR and
DESeq require count data as input. Hence, we combined these last
two methods with BEDTools for the comparison. Since the most
time consuming and memory intensive operation is the counting
of reads per region, which is done with BEDTools, edgeR and
DESeq show the same behaviour. The performance of DEGseq
suffers in terms CPU time and especially memory usage. Although
Pyicos is not as fast as the combination of BEDTools with edgeR or
DESeq, it still can handle very large datasets at much lower memory
usage (Supplementary Fig. S16 and Fig. 2C). BEDTools algorithm
compromises memory usage in exchange of execution time, whereas
Pyicos algorithm focuses on memory efﬁciency.

3.4 Normalization of the RNA-Seq data

As genes have different lengths and RNA-Seq samples may vary
considerably in size, proper normalization of the input data is
essential. The trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalization
(Robinson and Oshlack, 2010) aims to correct biases due to
differences in samples sizes and expression patterns. TMM
normalization on count data correctly places the M median on
zero on our gene set (Supplementary Figs S17a and S17b). We
considered the combination of TMM normalization with RPKM
densities, which we hypothesize that it would improve results as
it takes into account both gene lengths and sample sizes. We
thus deﬁne a TRPK density as the TMM-normalized Read Per
Kilobase density (Supplementary Material). First, as expected, using
TRPK we can achieve a correction of the M-median for RPKM
(Supplementary Figs S170 and S17d). Next, we assessed whether the
TMM normalization also results in an improvement of the accuracy
calculation using the array results. However, for this particular
benchmarking set, we could not observe such an improvement
(Fig. 2d).

Intriguingly, read counts seem to perform slightly better in our
benchmarking analysis, as shown above. However, they have been
observed to produce length biases in the determination of DE genes
(Oshlack and Wakeﬁeld, 2009). To explore the correction effect
of the various normalizations on the length biases, we calculated
the lengths for all DE and non-DE genes predicted by Pyicos
EA using counts, TMM normalized counts, RPKM and TRPK;
and compared them to the lengths of the DE and non-DE genes
from the microarray results (Supplementary Fig. S18). We observe
a signiﬁcant difference between the absolute length medians of
DE and non-DE genes when normalized counts are not used.
However, this difference decreases when we use the RPKM and
TMM-normalized read counts, achieving the smallest difference and
reaching a similar value to the one found for the microarray when
TRPK is used (Fig. 2e).

3.5 EA on broad ChIP-Seq data

We next provide evidence that Pyicos EA approach is also suitable
for the analysis of broad ChIP-Seq data when comparing two
conditions. Broad ChIP-Seq data does not generally produce Clearly
delimited regions; hence, one cannot speak of peaks. However, it is
interesting to be able to measure how the signal Changes between
two conditions or cell types in speciﬁc regions. Pyicos allows
the calculation of signiﬁcant enrichment in predeﬁned regions,
e.g. gene-body, promoter regions, etC., which are given as input

in a BED ﬁle. To show the applicability of Pyicos on broad ChIP-
Seq data, we tried to reproduce the relation between RNAPII activity
and transcription (Sultan et (11., 2008) and between the H3K36me3
Chromatin signal and transcription (Joshi and Struhl, 2005; Pokholok
et (11., 2005). For this, we calculated the correlation of the enrichment
of H3K36me3 and RNAPII, with that of RNA-Seq using ENCODE
datasets (ENCODE Consortium, 2011). For each datatype, we
calculated the EA values of K562 over NHEK, considering the
variation between two K562 replicas (Section 2). We selected a cut-
off of |Z-score| > 10, obtaining 1238 genes with signiﬁcant Changes
in RNAPII and RNA-Seq, and 377 genes with signiﬁcant Changes
in H3K36me3 and RNA-Seq. For these gene sets, we measured
a Pearson’s correlation between the enrichment Z-scores of 0.87
and 0.90, for RNAPII versus RNA-Seq and H3K36me3 versus
RNA-Seq, respectively.

3.6 CLIP-Seq data analysis

CLIP-Seq reads can be mapped to the genome or to the transcriptome
in order to detect RNA binding activity. CLIP experiments normally
use a control with an unspeciﬁc antibody to Check the presence of
unspeciﬁc binding. However, such a control is not always sequenced;
hence, a method to calculate enrichment without a control was
proposed (Xue et (11., 2009; Yeo et (11., 2009). This method, called
modiﬁed false discovery rate (modFDR), is included in Pyicos
(Supplementary Material). In order to show Pyicos applicability to
CLIP-Seq experiments, we reproduced the results from Xue et (11.
(2009), where the interacting RNA sites for the polypyrimidine tract
binding protein were mapped to the reference human genome. We
used all the mapped reads from this experiment and ran Pyicos
modFDR operation considering the gene-body of the RefSeq genes
as regions to calculate the signiﬁcant read Clusters. Pyicos retrieved
92% of the 32 298 regions deﬁned in Xue et (11. (2009) on the same
gene set, which means 91.5% of the reported 10515 genes having
at least one signiﬁcant Cluster (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the genes missed
by Pyicos modFDR were those with a low number of reads: from the
467 genes missed by Pyicos, 89.7% contained Clusters with heights
of at most three reads (Fig. 3b), suggesting that they are likely FPs.
Moreover, there were 898 genes selected by Pyicos that were not

in the predictions from Xue et (11. (2009), from which 11.1% had
Clusters that are >3, indicating that Pyicos may still recover real sites
that are borderline. Nonetheless, the Clusters missed by either case
had P-values Closely above the used 0.001 thresholds, indicating
that the observed variation was mostly due to the random nature of
the background model calculation.

4 DISCUSSION

We have described Pyicos, a powerﬁil tool for the analysis of
mapped HTS reads. Pyicos framework facilitates the analysis of
different HTS datatypes. We have described its application to ChIP-
Seq, RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq data using the three corresponding
protocols: callpeaks, enrichment and clipseq. In callpeaks, we deﬁne
a peak score in terms of a Poisson P-value, which is calculated
independently for each Chromosome, and in terms of one peak
property, either the peak height or read count. The peak score
therefore takes into account the differences across Chromosomes
and the fact that peaks with the same height or read count may have
different P-values depending on the Chromosome in which they are
located. Using ChIP-Seq data for PR, CTCF, CEBPA and NRSF, we
have shown that the peak score provides an appropriate ranking for
peaks. Interestingly, using either the peak height or read count can
make a difference depending on the dataset, as we found an increase
of ~7% in the fraction of the top 500 PR peaks with motifs, leading
to a better peak deﬁnition compared with the other methods. We
have further shown that the subtraction of the control is effective to
increase the fraction of peaks with motif, indicating that it eliminates
potential FPs.

Pyicos has the advantage that all operations described are
conﬁgurable by the user to keep as much ﬂexibility as possible,
since not all of them may be applicable to a dataset. For instance,
splitting peaks seems to result in improvements only for CTCF.
Similarly, although Pyicos allows the user to Choose the number of
tolerated duplicated reads, we found that in all datasets the best peak
deﬁnition is achieved by removing all duplicates.

Furthermore, using various measures, we have compared
callpeaks with three other methods speciﬁcally developed for
punctuated ChIP-Seq data: MACS, USeq and FindPeaks. Regarding
peak deﬁnition, we have found that FindPeaks, Pyicos and MACS
show very similar spatial resolutions, which are also higher than
those for USeq peaks. Furthermore, we observed that peaks ranked
by Pyicos and MACS show a slightly higher fraction of motif-
Containing peaks than those ranked by FindPeaks and USeq.

Peak detection has been assessed using ChIP-qPCR validated
positive and negative regions for NRSF. We found that all methods
perform similarly, probably due to high agreement between their
generated peaks. The methods with the highest pairwise correlations
are Pyicos, MACS and USeq. FindPeaks showed a lower correlation,
probably due to a different handling of the control sample: whereas,
FindPeaks compares a peak height with the distribution of peak
heights from the control sample, the other three methods compare
signal to control locally, using windows (MACS and USeq) or at base
pair resolution (Pyicos). In summary, our results lead us to conclude
that callpeaks provides an accurate protocol for peak detection for
punctuated ChIP-Seq data. Moreover, due to the more ﬂexible usage
of the various operations compared with other methods, it allows to
design a customized analysis of the ChIP-Seq data.

Pyicos

 

We have ﬁirther illustrated Pyicos ﬂexibility by applying it
to other datatypes. Using data from RNA-Seq and microarray
experiments on liver and kidney samples, we have shown that
Pyicos can recover DE genes with high accuracy and that is in
fact comparable to methods speciﬁcally designed for differential
expression analysis from RNA-Seq. Moreover, Pyicos performs well
using different inputs: replicated or non-replicated, read counts or
RPKM. DEGseq, which can also work with RPKM, shows similar
accuracy as Pyicos and both correlate well in terms of the predicted
Z-scores. The other two methods, DESeq and edgeR, were not
designed to work with RPKM, hence could not be included in
the comparison. The fact that Pyicos performs well with simulated
replicated data presents the advantage of making possible to analyse
many of the published datasets that have been produced without
replica.

It is surprising that the highest accuracy is achieved on count
data, since it is known that using counts leads to a length bias in
DE gene detection. This is probably because the genes selected
from the microarray for benchmarking are not much affected by the
length bias, since the accuracy hardly changes when using RPKM.
This also suggests that RPKM alone does not provide the optimal
normalization method. However, using a new density deﬁnition,
TRPK, which combines RPKM with the TMM normalization, the
length differences between DE and non-DE genes are reduced to
a level close to that of the microarray. Nonetheless, the TMM
normalization is based on the assumption that the majority of regions
tested do not change signiﬁcantly, which might not hold true for
some pairs of samples or for certain sets of regions. Accordingly,
Pyicos implements this as an option to the user.

The ﬂexibility of Pyicos is further demonstrated by applying the
EA protocol to broad ChIP-Seq data. In particular, using ENCODE
ChIP-Seq data for H3K36me3 and RNAPII from the cell lines K562
and NHEK, we obtain a high correlation for the Z-scores of these
signals when compared with the enrichment Z-scores for RNA-Seq
between the same cell lines. Thus, the EA of Pyicos using RPKM
provides a tool to analyse broad ChIP-Seq data of various sorts,
which would otherwise require a combination of approaches to be
analysed (Young et (11., 201 1). A further advantage is that Pyicos can
directly accept BED ﬁles with mapped reads and regions of interest,
unlike DESeq and edgeR. Pyicos can also calculate enriched regions
de novo genome wide, using the reads from two experiments that
are overlapping or sufﬁciently close in position. This is particularly
useﬁil for the analysis of signals for which the user does not know
where to expect the enrichment relative to genome annotations, like
enhancer elements. We have ﬁirther shown that Pyicos can also be
used to process CLIP-Seq data without a control. We expect that
many of the basic Pyicos operations could be applicable to other
datatypes and could possibly be combined to generate new analysis
protocols.

Some of the operations described can become impracticable for
some analysis tools due to the amount of reads produced by a
single HTS experiment nowadays. The bottleneck of HTS data
analysis mostly lies in the memory usage of the software and in the
storage and retrieval of data. Indeed, HTS data generation seems to
be outpacing the improvements in CPU and disk storage (Kahn,
2011). Moreover, HTS data has become ubiquitous in genomic
research; hence, we should aim to provide software that can be
adapted to the available computing resources and, in particular,
that can run on the average desktop computer. For these reasons,

we developed Pyicos minimizing RAM usage and maintaining
reasonable CPU time usage. Pyicos callpeaks protocol for ChIP-
Seq data outperforms the other tested methods concerning memory
usage while it stays competitive in running time. FindPeaks and
USeq algorithms load entire ﬁles in memory, allowing for better
time performance. However, this is only practical on a computer
with enough RAM. For example, an experiment with 100 million
reads using as input a BED ﬁle, would require >4 GB available
of RAM. For EA, the main bottleneck lies in the calculation of
read counts or RPKM on the input regions. Although Pyicos is
not as fast as BEDTools combined with DESeq or edgeR, its
memory performance is far superior, allowing the handling of very
large datasets. As made patent in the last few years, read ﬁles
are increasing enormously in size with the development of the
technology, making memory usage a critical feature in HTS analysis
software.

We conclude that the added value of having a modular tool is not at
the cost of accuracy or performance; hence, Pyicos provides a useful
framework for the analysis and integration of heterogeneous HTS
data. Finally, as Pyicos is open source, we encourage the addition
of new operations in order to combine them with already existing
ones and possibly to create new analysis protocols.

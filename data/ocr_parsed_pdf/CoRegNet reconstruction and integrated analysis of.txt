Abstract

CoREGNET is an R/Bioconductor package to analyze large—scale transcriptomic data by highlighting
sets of co—regulators. Based on a transcriptomic dataset, CoREGNET can be used to: reconstruct a
large—scale co—regulatory network, integrate regulation evidences such as transcription factor
binding sites and ChIP data, estimate sample—specific regulator activity, identify cooperative
transcription factors and analyze the sample—specific combinations of active regulators through an
interactive visualization tool. In this study CoREGNET was used to identify driver regulators of

bladder cancer.

Availability: CoREGNET is available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/CORegNet

1 Introduction

Recent advances in genomics enabled the profiling of thousands of
tumors by large consortia and individual laboratories. While the
amount of data holds great promise for our understanding of
tumorigenesis, these datasets necessitate efficient methodologies to
extract valuable knowledge from them.

Transcriptomics is the most commonly available type of tumor
large—scale data. The transcriptome reflects the genetic, epigenetic
and environmental states of a tumor tissue and determines a great
extent the phenotype of cells. Therefore, one of the first step to—
wards the construction of a mechanistic model underlying cancer is
the identification of the sets of transcription factors (TF) that ac—
tively maintain a malignant phenotype. This requires methodologies
to model the tissue specificity of gene regulation by inferring trustful
context—specific networks. More importantly, these models must
take into account the complexity of mammalian gene regulation
often involving the coordinated action of several TF (Panne, 2008).

To identify tumor—driving active regulatory circuits, we propose
a Bioconductor (Huber et (11., 2015) package named COREGNET to
(i) reconstruct a large—scale co—regulatory network from gene expres—
sion data and by integrating additional regulatory evidences such as
TF Binding site and ChIP data, (ii) estimate the activity of each TF

of the network in any given sample, (iii) predict sets of cooperative
TF and (iv) identify sample—specific combination of active and driver
TF using an interactive visualization tool integrating genomic aber—
rations. The proposed methods can be used as independent modules
with alternative inputs such as networks inferred by other methods,
experimentally defined networks or a different transcriptomic data
for TF activity prediction and visualization (e.g. cell lines of same
tissue). The following sections outline the functions of the
COREGNET package and its application to the characterization of the
driver regulators of bladder cancer subtypes.

2 The COREGNET application

Each following sections are detailed in the Supplementary
Information file and the workflow is illustrated in Figure 1.

2.1 Regulatory network inference and refinement

To reconstruct a large—scale regulatory network from gene expres—
sion data, the COREGNET package implements the H—LICORN algo—
rithm (Chebil et (11., 2014; Elati et (11., 2007). Compared to current
methods, H—LICORN focuses on the identification of cooperative regu—
lators of genes. It was proven to have comparable TF—gene pairs

the proportion of each alteration status in either all samples or in the selected subtype. The selection of a single TF will display a multi-Iayer heatmap to visualize

the relationship between sample phenotype and TF expression, activity and CNA

prediction performance with state of the art methods in synthetic
and Human datasets (Chebil et (11., 2014) and to retrieve more plaus—
ible cooperative TF pairs in yeast (Elati et (11., 2007, Lai et (11., 2014)
and Human datasets (see Supplementary Information). To obtain a
trustful network, regulatory and co—regulatory interactions can be
integrated as additional evidences. These can include any type of
TF—gene interaction data to support regulatory interactions (e.g.
ChIP—seq, TF binding site) and TF—TF interaction data to support
cooperative interactions (e.g. protein interactions). The inferred net—
work can then be refined by selecting a subset of the network that is
enriched in these external regulatory and co—regulatory evidences
using an integrative selection algorithm (Marbach et (11., 2012).

2.2 Transcription factor influence

COREGNET implements a function to estimate the activity of a TF in
a given sample. This is based on a measure of transcriptional inﬂu-
ence, which was shown to provide a transformed view of the tran—
scriptome in which classification algorithms are more robust
(Nicolle et (11., 2012). Based on a comparison of the expression of
the activated and the repressed targets of a regulator, the inﬂuence is
computed in a sample—specific manner (details in Supplementary
Information). Robustness of the measure was tested by correlating
for each TF the inﬂuence using the original network and using a par—
tially permuted version of the network with increasing levels of
noise. The same was done by correlating the inﬂuence on the sub—
parts of the network that are validated by regulatory evidences. In
all comparisons, the inﬂuence was significantly more robust and
consistent with the validated network (e.g. 97% correlation with
20% of noise, 96% for the ChIP validated network) than the other
measures of TF activity that were tested (e.g. 75% with 20% of
noise and 72% ChIP validation for network component analysis,
details and reference in Supplementary Information). Furthermore,
the inﬂuence predicts well the activity of a TF in samples in which it
was activated at the protein level by a chemical agonist (details in
Supplementary Information).

2.3 Constructing a network of cooperative TF

To model the active transcriptional programs, a co—regulation net—
work is built by setting an edge between two significantly coopera—
tive TF (details in Supplementary Information). The relevance of
using the H—LICORN algorithm to directly infer a cooperative network
is shown by the higher enrichment of the predicted co—regulators in
experimentally validated and independently predicted protein

interactions (AUPR: 14% for COREGNET, 6% max. among the four
tested algorithms, see Supplementary Information).

2.4 Integrative visualization of transcriptional activity
Transcriptomes are summarized by the inﬂuence of the regulators on
the expression of their target genes in the analyzed samples. This ab—
straction of the transcriptomes through TF activity reduces the num—
ber of features thereby simplifying the visualization of the dataset.
Moreover, the co—regulation network unravels the combination of TF
at work in the studied samples. Thus, an interactive visualization tool
is embedded in the COREGNET package to analyze several layers of in—
formation through the sets of active co—regulators. The co—regulation
network is accessible through a Cytoscape (Shannon et (11., 2003)
widget with functionalities to display sets of active co—regulators in
particular samples or subtypes (examples in Fig. 1 and in
Supplementary Information).

2.5 Implementation and availability

COREGNET is an R package implementing a Shiny (Winston et (11.,
2015) and Cytoscape javascript applet for visualization. The net—
work inference method is implemented in C and can be parallelized.
The package is available as a Supplementary File or through the
Bioconductor repository.

3 Case study

The COREGNET package was used to analyze a set of bladder cancer
samples for which both transcriptome and genomic alterations were
available (Biton et (11., 2014, Rebouissou et (11., 2014). The inferred
network was used to estimate the inﬂuence of regulators and the visu—
alization tool to identify active sets of master regulators for each blad—
der cancer subtype. In line with previous studies (Biton et (11., 2014;
Choi et (11., 2014), PPARy was found to be the most active TF in the
luminal bladder cancer TCGA subgroup I. Association with genomic
alteration suggesting PPARy to be a major driver of these tumors (see
Supplementary Information), which has been recently validated ex—
perimentally (Biton et (11., 2014). Moreover, FOXA1, an effector of
PPARy (Varley et (11., 2008) and a co—factor of GATA3 in luminal
breast cancer (Kong et (11., 2011), is a significant co—regulator of both
GATA3 and PPARy in the inferred network.

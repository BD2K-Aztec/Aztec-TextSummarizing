Kinannote

 

combined with the unusual protein kinases identiﬁed in phase 2, and the
new kinome is compared with reference kinomes.

2.1.] Phase I: First cut and gathering information Kinannote uses
an HMM derived from a manual alignment of the Dictyostelium
kinome (Goldberg et al. 2006). The Dictyostelium branch-point on the
eukaryotic tree is centrally located (Baldauf, 2003), resulting in a model
sensitive to ePKs from diverse parts of the tree. This HMM is used in a
HMMER search of the input protein set [HMMER 2.3.2 (Eddy, 1998)]
using a relaxed cutoff (HMM E-value for candidate selection, Table 1;
Fig. 1.1), resulting in a reduction of the search space for subsequent steps
by ~95% without loss of divergent kinases. The remaining sequences are
referred to as candidates (Fig. 1b); their scores and alignments to the
HMM are stored for later reference.

Protein kinase domains contain highly conserved substructures
involved in catalysis, substrate binding and magnesium binding (Hanks
and Hunter, 1995; Kannan and Neuwald, 2005). The identities of residues
in catalytic substructures are often more constrained by functional
requirements than by the need, distributed over a larger number of resi-
dues, to stabilize the protein (Fersht, 1985). As substitution matrices used
by common proﬁle-building methods are most inﬂuenced by the effects of
residues on protein stability (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992), proﬁles based
on these methods may underestimate the relative importance of func-
tional residues. To obtain a PSSM more sensitive to kinase subdomain
motifs, we made a HMMER alignment of domains from curated kinases
(www.kinase.com). Most residues observed in this alignment are ‘viable’,
meaning that they occur in active kinases and are thus given equal weight
in our PSSM.

Positions in the scoring matrix are weighted inversely to the sequence
variability at the corresponding alignment position; therefore, for
example, the position two residues upstream of the catalytic aspartate
is highly weighted and has viable residues H and Y. Residues in candidate
sequences receive scores based on their alignment positions if they contain
viable residues, or scores of zero if they do not contain viable residues.
Positional scores are summed to provide sequence scores, which are
applied in phase 2 of the algorithm. For additional details on the
PSSM, see Supplementary Document S1.

Candidates are searched with BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) against
a local version of selected curated kinomes from KinBase downloaded
on 23 December 2011 (Fig. 1.3). The set of curated kinomes used by
Kinannote is indicated in Supplementary Table S2. The BLAST database
contains both ePKs, for which the sequences of the kinase domains are
used for reference, and aPKs, for which the entire protein sequences are
used; the results of this search are applied later in the algorithm.

2.1.2 Phase 2: Identification
Identiﬁcation of conserved unusual kinases and some aPKs: Conserved
ePKs with unusual sequences such as SLOB, SCYLl, Bub, Bud32 and

Table 1. Cutoffs used by Kinannote

Haspin tend to score poorly in searches using protein kinase HMMs.
They are identiﬁed at this stage (Fig. 1.4) owing to the presence of similar
kinases in KinBase. Atypical protein kinases were not used to build the
HMM used for the HMMER search; however, several types of PKL
aPKs, notably RIO and ABCl, are similar enough to ePKs (Kannan
and Neuwald, 2005; Leonard et al., 1998; Scheeff and Bourne, 2005) to
enter the candidate set and are identiﬁed by similarity to relatives in
KinBase. Unusual protein kinases and aPKs thus identiﬁed are included
in the kinome (Fig. 1c).

Identification of typical kinases and twilight hits: Once conserved
unusual kinases and PKL aPKs have been identiﬁed, non-kinases may
be removed from the candidate set without loss of poorly scoring con-
served kinases (Fig. 1.5). Sequences scoring below the PSSM cutoff
(Motif score for twilight hit identiﬁcation, Table 1) are dropped, and
sequences above this cutoff and below the ‘HMM score for kinase iden-
tiﬁcation’ (Table 1) are identiﬁed as twilight hits (Fig. 1d). The remaining
sequences are considered ePKs, added to the kinome (Fig. 1e) and clas-
siﬁed. Twilight hits, designated ‘protein kinase subdomain-containing
proteins’, are not part of the ﬁnal kinome but may provide seed sequences
for delineating novel PKL families.

2.1.3 Phase 3: Classification

Unclassified kinases: To avoid misclassifying potentially novel, divergent
kinases, or kinases with incorrect gene models, Kinannote refrains from
classifying poorly scoring ePKs. Sequences with E-values greater than the
‘BLAST E-value for classiﬁcation’ and scores below the ‘HMM score for
classiﬁcation’ (Table 1) are not classiﬁed. The suggested gene product
name for these sequences is ‘serine/threonine protein kinase’, and they
are ﬂagged in ﬁles produced by Kinannote to facilitate their further cur-
ation. Sequences for which the group level classiﬁcations of the top
BLAST hits are inconsistent (see later in the text) are also not classiﬁed.

Full classification: Kinannote classiﬁes the remaining ePKs into
groups, families and subfamilies (Fig. 1.7) using top BLAST hits. The
algorithm requires that a set number of consecutive top BLAST hits agree
to provide a classiﬁcation (Number of consistent BLAST hits, Table 1);
as there are three levels of classiﬁcation, hits may agree, or not agree, at
the group, family, or subfamily levels. Full classiﬁcations are made if the
top BLAST hits agree at the same classification depth as the reference
kinase, which may be classiﬁed either to the group/family level or the
group/family/subfamily level. Kinannote allows the number of consecu-
tive top BLAST hits that are considered in making classiﬁcation decisions
to be set by the user.

Partial classiﬁcation and uncertainty: Protein kinases discovered in new
genomes often do not ﬁt into existing families or subfamilies but are
evolutionarily related to known groups or families. Kinannote partially
classiﬁes these kinases if possible. If the consecutive top BLAST hits for a
sequence are consistent at the group level, but not at the family level, the
sequence is partially classiﬁed to that group. If the top BLAST hits

against a sequence agree at the group and family level, but not at the
subfamily level, the sequence is classiﬁed to that group and family. Partial
classiﬁcation may also result for kinases with incomplete gene models or
in species that are evolutionarily divergent from those in the reference
database.

TK classiﬁcation: The TK group is thought to have arisen on the
branch that gave rise to metazoans after divergence from the fungal
branch (Manning et al., 2008); classiﬁcation of earlier-evolving TK
group members thus requires manual veriﬁcation. Kinannote takes a
conservative approach toward TK classiﬁcation in species that are not
metazoans or their close relatives. In non-metazoans, kinases for which
the best BLAST hits against the reference database are TK group mem-
bers are classiﬁed as tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) and ﬂagged in the draft
kinome table produced by Kinannote. Kinannote treats input as non-
metazoan by default; the user must run Kinannote with the ‘-m’ ﬂag in
the command line to classify TK group members normally in metazoans
and their relatives (Supplementary File S1 and online documentation at
sourceforge.net/projects/kinannote).

The union of fully and partially classiﬁed ePKs, unclassiﬁed ePKs,
divergent ePKs and aPKs (Fig. 1 sets g, f, c, respectively) is referred to
as the draft kinome. Kinannote records the draft kinome with its asso-
ciated search scores, labels twilight hits as ‘protein kinase subdomain-
containing proteins’ and ﬂags rejected candidates as ‘subthreshold’.
This ﬁle is used for post-run processing.

2.2 Summary, comparative kinomics, the draft kinome
and gene product names

Kinannote provides extensive metadata and contextual information
about the new draft kinome (Supplementary Table S3). A compact
summary table provides a total kinase count, and counts for the group
and unclassiﬁed categories. If the input is a whole proteome, then the
percentage of kinases in the predicted protein set is given, and a list of
missing core kinases is provided, where the core is determined by presence
in the set of references kinomes from Dictyostelium discoideum,
Saccharomyces cerervisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabdidtis ele-
gans and Homo sapiens. The analyses in this ﬁle allow the completeness of
the kinome to be assessed, which serves as a proxy for the coverage of the
input proteome. A phylogenetic comparison of the new kinome (or
kinome subset) and reference kinomes is provided in a separate table.
The missing core kinases identiﬁed in these tables provide a basis for
hole-ﬁlling and comparative analysis. A list of classiﬁcation-based gene
product names and a summary of the parameters used in the run are also
provided. Kinannote produces a ﬁle containing the parameters that were
used for the latest run. Parameters in this ﬁle may modiﬁed by the user,
and the ﬁle may be renamed, and read using the command line ‘-p’ ﬂag
(Supplementary File S1 and online documentation at sourceforge.net/
projects/kinannote).

Kinannote provides output with details about each identiﬁed kinase
(the draft kinome table), twilight hits and rejected candidates. This table
includes a column indicating the classiﬁcation depth of each kinase: ‘0’ if
the kinase is unclassiﬁed, ‘1’ if it is classiﬁed only to the group level, and
‘2’ or ‘3’ if it is classiﬁed to the family or subfamily levels, respectively.
The classiﬁcation ﬁelds associated with unclassiﬁed kinases remain empty
in this table, but they are identiﬁed as ‘unclassiﬁed’ in another column.
Kinases with classiﬁcation depths of 0 or 1 may be members of novel
families. The classiﬁcation depth number allows potentially novel kinases
and conserved kinases to be separated into two categories, providing a
good foundation for further curation of potentially novel kinases.
Members of PKL expansions contain recognizable kinase motifs but
score poorly against proﬁles built from typical kinases (Leonard et al.,
1998). These sequences are identiﬁed using Kinannote’s PSSM (see
Section 2); they are not included in the draft kinome, but they are labeled
‘protein kinase subdomain-containing proteins’ in the draft kinome table.

In genomes where novel PKL families occur, this list of twilight hits may
provide a starting point for further curation.

Kinannote provides a list of gene product names based on classiﬁca-
tion results. Classiﬁed kinases are named ‘group/family/subfamily protein
kinase’ using the controlled vocabulary maintained at KinBase: the
family and subfamily ﬁelds may be empty, depending on the classiﬁcation
result. Unclassiﬁed kinases are named ‘serine/threonine protein kinase’.

2.3 Test cases

Kinannote was tested on the full sets of predicted proteins from four
species for which curated kinomes are available: A.queenslandica
(Srivastava et al., 2010), Glamblia (Manning et al., 2011), Pfalciparum
(Talevich et al., 2011) and Spombe (Rhind et al., 2011) (Supplementary
Table S2). These species were chosen because they represent different
parts of the eukaryotic tree, their kinomes are comprehensive and well-
classiﬁed using the controlled vocabulary of Hanks and Hunter (1995)
and www.kinase.com, and they are not part of the reference database
used by Kinannote for identiﬁcation or classiﬁcation. The curation levels
of these test kinomes are adequate evaluating kinase prediction and clas-
siﬁcation algorithms, but they are not curated to the level of many of the
kinomes used in the reference database from KinBase, particularly those
of H.sapiens, D.melanogaster, C.elegans, S.cerevisaie and D.discoideum,
for which most kinases received individual attention. In addition, the
fragmentation of the A.queenslandica assembly results in many partial
gene models that are difﬁcult to curate deﬁnitively.

For comparison, tests were performed using protein kinase HMMs
downloaded from the Kinomer resource at www.compbio.dundee.ac.
uk/kinomer (Martin et al., 2009). Reference proteomes were searched
with Kinomer HMMs using the recommended cutoff score of 20, and kin-
ases were classiﬁed according to the group of the best scoring HMM hit.

2.4 Receiver operating characteristic analysis

To evaluate the performance of Kinannote with respect to the curated
datasets using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Metz,
2006), it must be determined whether a prediction is a true positive
(TP), true negative, false positive (FP) or false negative (FN). For protein
kinase identiﬁcation, this is straightforward (a sequence either is or is
not an ePK). Similarly, it is easy to determine whether a classiﬁcation
provided by Kinannote exactly matches that of the curated kinase.

Assessing the results for partially classiﬁed kinases is more compli-
cated. If the reference sequence is classiﬁed to the subfamily level, and
Kinannote correctly classiﬁes it to the group and family levels and leaves
the subfamily null, we deﬁne this as TP for partial classiﬁcation and FN
for full classiﬁcation. If Kinannote correctly classiﬁes the group and
leaves both family and subfamily null, this is also counted as TP for
partial and FN for full classiﬁcation, respectively. If Kinannote incor-
rectly assigns the subfamily, we deﬁne this as FP even if the group
and family match the reference because misclassiﬁcation negates correct
partial classiﬁcation in terms of the value of the annotation to a user.
If Kinannote provides no classiﬁcation for a classiﬁed reference kinase,
the partial classiﬁcation result is FN. Finally, if Kinannote and the ref-
erence agree that the sequence is an unclassiﬁed kinase, or is not a kinase,
the partial classiﬁcation is true negative. Similar logic is applied when the
reference kinase is only classiﬁed to the family level. The results of
application of the Kinomer HMMs to test proteomes were similarly
categorized.

For kinase identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation the false-discovery rate is
FDR=FP/(TP+FP), and the true-positive rate (TPR), sensitivity or
recall is TPR =TP /(TP + FN), where TP + FN is P, the number of ref-
erence positives. The precision is PPV = TP/(TP + FP), and the F-score is
2*PPV*TPR/(PPV+TPR). A single sequence may have different char-
acteristics, e.g. a TP for identiﬁcation may be an FN for classification.

and family levels in cases where that family is further divided into
subfamilies. Kinannote effectively fully and partially classiﬁes
more kinases than does our application of the Kinomer HMMs
(Fig. 4A7D, green regions of the third and fourth columns).
Kinannote takes a conservative approach to reﬂect uncertainty
in classiﬁcation, withholding full, and sometimes partial classiﬁ—
cation when the top BLAST hits against the reference database
are inconsistent, or the BLAST E—value of the best hit is above
threshold (Table 1). Such classiﬁcations are considered FNs for
full or partial classiﬁcation (Fig. 4A7D, yellow regions of the third
and fourth columns); they are included in the kinome, and they are
TPs for kinase identiﬁcation.

A case—by—case examination reveals two causes for the major—
ity of false—positive classiﬁcation calls made by Kinannote: FP
calls against Spombe are minor, resulting from nomenclature
updates and subfamily additions to the fungal reference kinomes
after curation of the ﬁssion yeast. The other test species are dis—
tantly related to the reference species and have species—speciﬁc
kinase expansions. In some instances, Kinannote classiﬁed spe—
cies—speciﬁc kinases based on the most closely related reference
kinases. Errors of this kind may be ameliorated by extension
of the reference database. Further examination of FF calls is
provided in Supplementary Document Sl.

Overall, Kinannote partially classiﬁes the reference kinomes
with average sensitivities and precisions of 76.6 and 84.5%,
respectively (Table 2). The corresponding values for classiﬁcation
of kinases to the group level by application of the Kinomer
HMMs are 79.5 and 53.9%, respectively. The relatively low pre—
cision of partial classiﬁcation by Kinomer (Fig. 4, fifth columns)
is the result of placement of unafﬁliated kinases (kinases from the
‘Other’ group) into one of the major groups. The average

sensitivity and precision values for full classiﬁcation by
Kinannote are 56.8 and 82.5%, respectively. If species—speciﬁc
kinases (cyan blocks in Fig. 4, first columns) are excluded from
the calculation, the average sensitivity for full classiﬁcation by
Kinannote rises to 71.5%.

Taken together, these results show that Kinannote identiﬁes
and fully or partially classiﬁes a wide range of protein kinases
with good sensitivity and precision. This, in addition to
Kinannote’s ease of use, fulﬁlls the need for a reliable high—
throughput method for kinome annotation.

3.4 Impact of kinannote on eukaryotic genome annotation

As of early 2013, Kinannote, or a combination of Kinannote and
manual curation, have been used to annotate the kinomes of
36 genomes produced by the Broad Institute (Supplementary
Table S2). An overview of 25 of these new kinomes, representing
a wide spectrum of eukaryotes, is given in Supplementary
Document $1 and Supplementary Figure $1. The accession num—
bers and phylogenetic proﬁles for these kinomes are provided in
Supplementary Tables S4 and SS, respectively.

3.5 Future directions

Addition of the test kinomes used for evaluation in this report
to the reference kinomes used by Kinannote will allow better
classiﬁcation of Fungal, Diplomonada, Apicomplexan and
basal metazoan kinases. Inclusion of new kinomes from
Dermatophytes (Martinez et al., 2012) and Apicomplexans
(Miranda—Saavedra et al., 2012; Talevich et al., 2011) and nema—
todes (Desjardins et al., 2013) will provided better depth and
allow classiﬁcation of members of newly described kinase
families present in these clades. Results from recent comparative
genomic studies (Beakes et al., 2012; Cuomo et al., 2012; Neafsey
et al., 2012) may be targeted for kinome curation to provide
better coverage of undersampled eukaryotic groups.

Many aPK families are described by speciﬁc Pfam HMMs; in—
clusion of additional searches with these HMMs will allow most
aPKs to be annotated. The addition of searches against Kinomer
HMMs will improve sensitivity toward TK—group expansions in
metazoans and pre—metazoans. Updated versions of Kinannote
will be available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/kinannote.

We will continue to use Kinannote to provide high—quality
automated kinome annotations for genomes sequenced at the
Broad Institute. We will also use Kinannote to generate data
for in—depth genomic and comparative biological studies, for
the study of protein kinase and signal transduction pathway evo—
lution and to identify potential drug and diagnostic targets in
pathogenic species.

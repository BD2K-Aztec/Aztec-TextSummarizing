ABSTRACT

Summary: Plasmodium falcipamm (PO-mediated malaria is one of
the most devastating diseases in the world, and the search for suitable
antimalarial drugs remains an extraordinary challenge for scientists
working in this area. Novel unconventional approaches could reveal
new potential targets that may be useful for the treatment of malaria.
We used a bioinformatics approach to analyze the entire genome of
the Pf3D7 strain. Because the carbon (C-) content is a pivotal param-
eter that determines the hydrophobicity of a protein, which in turn
controls protein folding and function, we analyzed the entire Pf3D7
proteome based on the gene’s thymine ("D-controlled amino acid
expression. Our data disclose a total of 14 proteins encoded by
chromosome-4 and chromosome-9 that have an outstanding
T-encoded and C-control led hydrophobic character. The identification
of these proteins could open new pivotal drug-targeting avenues.

1 INTRODUCTION

The most prevalent and lethal malaria parasite that infects
humans, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), may have recently under-
gone host switching to become a Plasmodia adaptation that is
speciﬁc for humans (Baron et al., 2011). Pfalciparum is the most
deadly of the ﬁve Plasmodium species that cause human malaria,
which is the world’s second largest cause of death after tubercu-
losis (Cohen et al., 2012; Langhorne et al., 2008). Thus we have
chosen to analyze the completely sequenced and annotated
Pf3D7 strain. The Pf3D7 nuclear genome is composed of 22.8
megabases, which are distributed among 14 chromosomes (Chrs)
(Gardner et al., 2002).

Despite the completion of the Pf3D7 genome and comparative
proteomics studies (Florens et al., 2002; Lasonder et a], 2002), we
are far from a strategy for curing this disease because there are
still too many uncharacterized proteins to obtain a reasonable
understanding of the disease-causing activity of Pfalciparum.

The base thymine (T) deﬁnes the stability of an organism at
the nucleotide level and, in turn, also controls the proteins’
carbon (C-) content and thus hydrophobicity for stability and
activity. Hydrophobic residues are important for dictating topo-
logical features of proteins because hydrophobic interactions are
the dominant force in proper protein folding and in organizing
the self-assembly of water-soluble globular proteins (Aftabuddin
and Kundu, 2007; Dyson et al., 2006).

In the current study, we analyzed the entire Pf3D7 genome
with regard to the T-content to identify potential novel proteins
that could have pivotal signiﬁcance in Pf3D7-mediated malaria.

2 METHODS

2.1 Dataset

Coding regions (CDRs) of the complete set of 5334 messenger RNA
sequences available for the Pf3D7 species studied here were downloaded
from a public database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Supplementary
Fig. S1).

2.2 Thymine distribution calculation

Using the programing language Perl, T-distribution analyses were con-
ducted for all of the CDRs of the genes of each chromosome of Pf3D7
{fraction of T = [number of T residues in the gene (CDR)]/ [total number
of nucleotides in the gene (CDR)]} (Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.3 Calculating the absolute and relative amino acid
numbers and protein lengths encoded by chromosome-
1-14 of Pf3D7

We used previously described vectors (Hua and Sun, 2001) to calculate
the proteins’ length and amino acid (AA) composition (Supplementary
Figs S37S6).

2.4 Hydrophobic and hydrophilic AA distribution in the
Pf3d7 proteome

We calculated the protein hydrophobicity under the consideration that
XTX-enooded (X = A, T, G or C; T = thymine) AAs, such as phenylalan-
ine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine and valine (FILMV; group A), and
non7XTX-encoded AAs, such as glycine, alanine, proline, cysteine and
tryptophan (GAPCW; group B), were considered separately. The com-
position FILMV=[(sum of the residues F+I+L+M+V in a protein)/
(total number of residues in the protein)] was calculated for all of the

proteins encoded by all of the 14 chromosome of Pf3D7, followed by
calculation of the average composition for each chromosome. Similarly,
the composition of GAPCW=[(sum of residues G+C+A+P+W in
a protein)/(total number of residues in the protein)] (Supplementary
Figs S7 and S8).

2.5 Carbon distribution in all of the proteins of Pf3d7
We calculated the C-content in all of the AAs and proteins of Pf3D7 by
translating the protein sequences into their corresponding atomic
sequences and applying the carbon distribution (CARd) program
(Rajasekaran, 2012) (Supplementary Fig. S9).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Thymine distribution and protein length encoded by all
14 chromosomes of Pf3D7

Chr-4 has a relatively low T-fraction, whereas the T-content in
Chr-9 is rather high. Considering the length of the proteins (Chr-
4 encodes for relatively long proteins), we show that the amounts
of the AAs asparagine (D) and glutamate (glutamic acid, E) are
relatively high, but the amount of phenylalanine (F) is relatively
low in the proteins encoded by Chr-4 (Supplementary Figs
S2786).

3.2 Hydrophobic residue compositions of all of the
proteins of Pf3D7

On the one hand, Chr-4 has relatively few XTX-encoded hydro-
phobic AAs, whereas Chr-9 has a relatively high number of
XTX-encoded hydrophobic AAs. On the other hand, Chr-4
and Chr-9 encode for a moderate number of noniXTX-encoded
hydrophobic AAs, whereas Chr-12 encodes for a low number of
noniXTX-encoded hydrophobic AAs (Supplementary Figs S7
and S8).

3.3 Carbon fraction analysis of all of the proteins of
Pf3D7

Furthermore, we found that the proteins encoded by Chr-4 have

a lower protein C-content than the proteins of all of the other

chromosomes, whereas Chr-l and Chr-9 encode for proteins

with a relatively high C-content (Supplementary Fig. S9).

3.4 Identiﬁcation of 10 proteins encoded by Chr-4
of Pf3D7

Recognizing that Chr-4 has a low T-content overall, encodes for
a relatively high average protein length with a low content
of XTX-encoded hydrophobic AAs and a low C-content
(Supplementary Figs S2, S6, S7 and S9), we examined 10 proteins
encoded by this Chr-4 more closely. We found that the relatively
high XTX-encoded hydrophobicity of proteins 8 (329 AAs) and
10 (778 AAs) could be explained by their transmembrane (TM)
domains, and that of protein-9 could be explained by its length
(1111 AAs). The particularly high XTX-encoded hydrophobicity
of protein-7 [413 AAs, probably S—adenosyl-methionine-depend—
ent methyltransferase (SAM- or AdoMet-MTase, class 1)], how-
ever, cannot be explained by its length nor a TM domain (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Fig. 810 and Supplementary Tables 81 and S3).

3.5 Proteins 11—14 encoded by Chr-9 of Pf3D7

We also examined Chr-9 more closely because it had the highest
content of XTX-encoded hydrophobic AAs; its carbon content
was also high (Supplementary Figs S7 and S9). Among the 375
XTX-encoded hydrophobic proteins, we determined that pro-
teins 11714 had a particularly high FILMV fraction (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Fig. 811 and Supplementary Tables S2, 8486).

(TM); protein-14 = 521 AAs, (TM)

It is noteworthy that proteins 1714 are all relatively rich in Asn
(N, polar AA, uncharged side chain) and/or Lys (K, basic AA
charged side chain); both of these AAs are non-hydrophobic
AAs that have an additional NH2 group in their side chains.
It has already been shown that Pf has a higher Asn frequency
than other Plasmodium species Wadav and Swati, 2012).

Thymine distribution in genes

 

Our approach also identiﬁed the well-known protein riﬁn.
Independent of the length of the proteins and across chromo-
somes 4 and 9, we found three ATPases (proteins 9, 10 and 12)
and several membrane-associated proteins, all of which are fur-
ther discussed below.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 XTX- and non-XTX—encoded AAs and C-content
in the Pf3D7 proteome

We found that chromosomes 4 and 7 of Pf3D7 had the lowest
level of XTX-encoded AAs and the lowest C-content. In contrast,
Chr-9 has the highest level of XTX-encoded AAs and the highest
C-content (Supplementary Figs S7 and S9) and hence could
encode for more globular proteins. Most of the proteins on
these chromosomes have not been characterized yet. However,
their characterization is of utmost importance because it is tempt-
ing to speculate that the relative T-encoded C-content of Chr-4
could account for the higher Virulence of Pf (Fard et al., 2009).

The 14 proteins disclosed here have a divergent hydrophobic
feature, thus attracting special attention for future functional
investigations. Noticeably, protein-3 (its ch25 domain indicates
its involvement in catalyzing spliceosome reactions) has an out-
standing C-content, whereas the overall low T-content of gene-14
(serine/threonine protein kinase, FIKK family) correlates with a
low protein C-content, therefore providing these two proteins
exceptional qualities (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. Top: relative T-distribution in all of the 14 genes (Supplementary
Tables S17S6) (open reading frames only). In each gene, the numbers of
A, C, G and T residues were calculated. The total count of A, C, G and T
was then calculated. The number of T was then divided by the total
number of [T/(A+C+G+T)]. Bottom: the relative C-content of all of
the 14 proteins. For each protein, the total number of C-atoms was
divided by the total number of atoms: [C/(C+S+N+O+H)]

4.2 Protein-7: AdoMet—MTase

AdoMet—MTases use SAM as a substrate for methyl transfer to
create the product S—adenosyl-L—homocysteine (AdoHcy), which
is used by AdoHcy hydrolases. AdoMet—MTases and AdoHcy
hydrolases are currently under intense investigation as putative
drug targets for the treatment of malaria (Bobenchik et al., 2011;
Mpangase et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2013).
The AdoMet-MTases are putatively redox-regulated proteins in
malarial parasites and provide a functional link between
AdoMet—MTases (protein-7, Chr-4) and Tlp2 (protein-1 l,
Chr-9) (Sturm et al., 2009).

4.3 Protein-8: Rifm

Riﬁn and stevor are proteins with variable surface antigens that
are uniquely found in the malaria parasites Pfalciparum and
Plasmodium reichenowi. These two pathogens have evolved stra-
tegies to survive within the hosts they infect by varying the anti-
gens they expose to the host immune system, which usually
results in the proliferation of multicopy protein families that
are commonly called variable surface antigens (J oannin et al.,
2011; Templeton, 2009).

4.4 Protein-9: AAA+ ATPase

This AAA+ ATPase contains a von Willebrand factor type A
domain [MDN1, midasin homolog; the members of this sub-
group have a conserved MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion
site) motif; however, the function of this domain is not known].
AAA+ ATPases are involved, inter alia, in promoting the deg-
radation of ubiquinated proteins by the proteasome (Chou et al.,
2010). In Pfalciparum, these proteins have also been described as
being involved in DNA replication and transcription, chromatin
remodeling, genome stability (Ansari and Tuteja, 2012) and
intra—erythrocytic schizogony (Ahmad et al., 2012) and also as
being part of a novel export machine in malarial parasites
(de Koning—Ward et al., 2009),

4.5 Protein-10: ATPase

Protein-10 contains a TM- and a LITAF-ABC2 domain. The
Pfalciparum ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type transporter
superfamily is composed of 16 members, and current knowledge
of their physiological function and contribution to antimalarial
drug resistance is limited (Alcantara et al., 2013; Koenderink
et al., 2010; Sauvage et al., 2009). In humans, an association of
ABCAl promoter polymorphisms with susceptibility to severe
malaria has been reported (Sahu et al., 2013). The Pfalciparum
multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdrl) encodes a food vacuolar
membrane transporter and has been linked with parasite drug
resistance. Pfalciparum develops resistance by gradually acquir-
ing genetic polymorphisms that decrease drug susceptibility
(Malmberg et al., 2013).

4.6 Protein-11: Tlp2

Pfalciparum possesses a functional thioredoxin and glutathione
system comprising the dithiol-containing redox proteins thiore-
doxin (Trx), glutaredoxin (er) and plasmoredoxin (Plrx)
(Rahlfs et al., 2003). To maintain the intracellular redox balance,

B.Palanisamy et al.

 

Pfalciparum uses this complex thioredoxin and glutathione
system (J ortzik and Becker, 2012). Among their target proteins,
several enzymes involved in SAM metabolism have been
described, which suggests that redox control is required to bal-
ance the metabolic ﬂuxes of SAM between methyl group transfer
reactions and polyamine synthesis (Sturm et al., 2009).

4.7 Protein-12: V-ATPase

Ion transport processes are expected to play a role in both patho-
genicity and adaptation. The V-type H+-ATPase is critical
during the intra-erythrocytic stage of the human malaria parasite
Pfalciparum; it is responsible for maintaining a near-neutral
cytosolic pH (pH 7.3), an acidic digestive vacuole (pH 4.}55)
and an inside-negative plasma membrane potential. Disruption
of parasite pH regulation through the inhibition of its V-type
H+-ATPase results in parasite death and has thus been con-
sidered as an antimalarial approach (Moriyama et al., 2003;
van Schalkwyk et al., 2010).

4.8 Protein-13

Protein-l3 is a TM protein with a putative rpoC2 domain that is
usually found in DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunits.
Localization of RNA replication to intracellular membranes,
such as the mitochondria, is a universal feature of positive-
strand RNA Viruses and has been described previously (Miller
and Ahlquist, 2002).

In conclusion, we disclose 14 proteins of the Pf3D7 proteome
with a pivotal T-encoded and C-controlled hydrophobic feature
that determines the proteins’ folding, structure and function.
Further molecular and cellular experiments could confirm these
molecules as functional therapeutic targets for the treatment of
Pfalciparum-induced malaria.

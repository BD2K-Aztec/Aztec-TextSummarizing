Abstract

Motivation: The vast majority of the many thousands of disease—associated single nucleotide poly—
morphisms (SNPs) lie in the non—coding part 0fthe genome. They are likely to affect regulatory elem—
ents, such as enhancers and promoters, rather than the function of a protein. To understand the
molecular mechanisms underlying genetic diseases, it is therefore increasingly important to study
the effect of a SNP on nearby moleculartraits such as chromatin ortranscription factor binding.
Results: We developed SNPhood, a user—friendly Bioconductor R package to investigate, quantify
and visualise the local epigenetic neighbourhood of a set of SNPs in terms of chromatin marks or
TF binding sites using data from NGS experiments.

Availability and implementation: SNPhood is publicly available and maintained as an R

 

Bioconductor package at http://bioconductor.0rg/packages/SNPhood/.

1 Introduction

To date, thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been
identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to be associated
with complex traits and diseases (www.genome.gov/gwastudies). The vast
majority of these disease- or trait-associated SNPs lie in the non-coding
part of the genome and are likely to affect regulatory elements (i.e. enhan-
cers and promoters) rather than the function of a protein. Thus, to under-
stand the molecular mechanisms underlying complex genetic traits and
diseases, it is increasingly important to study the effect of SNPs on nearby
molecular traits such as chromatin or transcription factor (TF) binding.
Current workflows for analysing ChIP-Seq data typically involve peak
calling, which summarises the signal of each binding event into two num-
bers: enrichment and peak size, and usually neglects additional factors
like binding shape. However, when a set of regions of interest (R01) is al-
ready at hand—e.g. GWAS SNPs, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), etc.—a
comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the molecular neighbourhood of
these regions, potentially in combination with genetic or allele-specific
binding (ASE) analyses will be more suited to investigate the underlying
(epi-)genomic regulatory mechanisms than simply comparing peak sizes.
Currently, such analyses are often carried out ‘by hand’ using basic NGS
tools and genome-browser like interfaces to visualise molecular phenotype

data independently for each ROI. A tool for systematic analysis of the
local molecular neighbourhood of R01 is currently lacking. To ﬁll this
gap, we developed SNP/aood, an R/Bioconductor package to investigate,
quantify and visualise the local epigenetic neighbourhood of ROI using
chromatin or TF binding data from NGS experiments. It provides a set of
tools that are largely complimentary to currently existing software for
analysing ChIP-Seq data. Many functionalities of SNP/aood have been
used in our recent study to investigate the chromatin environment of
H3K27ac QTLs, which has led to the conclusion that H3K27ac QTLs lie
in the nucleosome free regions and show the same effect across multiple
histone marks and TF binding (Grubert et (11., 2015). In addition,
SNP/aood supports ASB analyses, which is a powerful way for looking at
the effect of genetic variants even within small sample sizes. We anticipate
that it will be widely used for exploratory and quantitative functional gen-
omics analysis of SNPs and other ROI using NGS data.

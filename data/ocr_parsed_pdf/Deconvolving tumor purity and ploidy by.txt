ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the
study of cancer genomes. However, the reads obtained from NGS of
tumor samples often consist of a mixture of normal and tumor cells,
which themselves can be of multiple clonal types. A prominent prob-
lem in the analysis of cancer genome sequencing data is deconvolving
the mixture to identify the reads associated with tumor cells or a par-
ticular subclone of tumor cells. Solving the problem is, however, chal-
lenging because of the so-called ‘identifiability problem’, where
different combinations of tumor purity and ploidy often explain the
sequencing data equally well.

Results: We propose a new model to resolve the identifiability prob-
lem by integrating two types of sequencing information—somatic
copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity—within a unified
probabilistic framework. We derive algorithms to solve our model, and
implement them in a software package called PyLOH. We benchmark
the performance of PyLOH using both simulated data and 12 breast
cancer sequencing datasets and show that PyLOH outperforms exist-
ing methods in disambiguating the identifiability problem and estimat-
ing tumor purity.

Python and is publicly available at https://github.com/uci-cbc|/PyLOH.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and launch of
comprehensive cancer genome sequencing projects (Collins and
Barker, 2007; Hudson et al., 2010) have yielded an unprece-
dented View on the complex landscape of cancer genomes, lead-
ing to the discovery of new cancer-causing genes and pathways,
and novel therapeutic targets for treating cancers. Analyzing the
data from cancer genome sequencing remains, however, compu-
tationally challenging because of the shear size of the sequencing
data and the complexity of the tumor genomes and samples.
Cancer genomes are often characterized by wide-spread som-
atic copy number alterations (CNAs), where genomic segments
are deleted or duplicated one or more times. Identifying somatic
CNAs associated with speciﬁc tumor genomes is of long-

standing interest in the study of cancer genomes and is one of
the focal points of the cancer genome analysis. Many computa-
tional methods have been proposed to discover copy number
changes directly from DNA microarrays (Bignell et al., 2004;
Lindblad-Toh et al., 2000; Mei et al., 2000; Pinkel et al., 1998;
Zhao et al., 2004) or sequencing data (Campbell et al., 2008;
Chiang et al., 2008). However, most of these methods aim at
identifying the relative copy numbers of segments of the same
tumor genome. Discovering copy numbers in an absolute scale is
biologically more relevant (Carter et al., 2012) but more challen-
ging. This is because of the fact that the absolute copy number
changes can be affected by two confounding factors: (i) tumor
purity, the fraction of all cancerous cells within a heterogeneous
tumor sample, and (ii) tumor ploidy, the baseline copy number
of genomic segments or entire chromosomes (Carter et al., 2012;
Oesper et al., 2013), both of which are unknown and themselves
need to be estimated to infer absolute copy number changes. It is
possible to estimate tumor purity and ploidy using experimental
techniques such as quantitative image analysis Wuan et al., 2012)
and single-cell sequencing (NaVin et al., 2011); however, these
techniques are still too expensive or time-consuming to support
large-scale studies. Hence, it is of great interest to use computa-
tional approaches to estimate tumor purity and ploidy, and
consequently absolute copy number changes, directly from the
NGS data.

Tumor purity and ploidy affect not only copy number changes
in different segments of genomes but also the distribution of
allele frequencies in these segments. In the NGS data, these
two types of information can be summarized in terms of the
total number of reads mapped to each segment (total read
count) and the frequencies of reads matching B-alleles (B-allele
frequencies) at different sites. Computational methods have been
proposed to estimate tumor purity alone (Larson and Fridley,
2013; Su et al., 2012) or jointly with tumor ploidy (Carter et al.,
2012; Gusnanto et al., 2012; Oesper et al., 2013) based on these
two types of information extracted from NGS data.

Depending on how copy number changes and B-allele fre-
quency information are used, the existing methods can be
roughly grouped into two categories: one category of methods
use B-allele frequencies (BAFs) at somatic mutation sites to es-
timate tumor purity, including PurityEst (Su et al., 2012) and
PurBayes (Larson and Fridley, 2013). These methods leverage
the fact that the BAFs at somatic mutation sites are expected to
be ~0.5 if the tumor purity is 100%, and any addition of normal
cells will lead to a reduction in the observed BAFs at these sites.
The second category of methods relies on copy number changes

to estimate tumor purity and/or ploidy, including CNAnorm
(Gusnanto et al., 2012), THetA (Oesper et al., 2013) and
ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012). It has been shown that the
methods in the second category are often more accurate and
robust than those in the first category because of the fact that
(i) the total read counts are large in NGS data, and thus, meth-
ods relying on copy number changes are statistically more stable
than methods relying on BAFs at somatic mutation sites, the
number of which is often small, and (ii) the determination of
somatic mutations is not perfect and the inclusion of false-posi-
tive ﬁndings can signiﬁcantly bias the estimation (Koboldt et al.,
2012; Oesper et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 2013).

However, the utility of the methods relying on copy number
changes to estimate tumor purity and ploidy is severely hindered
by the so-called ‘identiﬁability problem’, where different combin-
ations of tumor purity and ploidy can explain the observed data
equally well (Carter et al., 2012; Oesper et al., 2013; Reiersral,
1950). This is because tumor purity and ploidy are often inter-
twinedH3hanges in one can be offset by compensations from the
other, allowing the same copy number to be explained by mul-
tiple combinations of tumor purity and ploidy. For example, a
homozygous deletion combined with 30% tumor purity can also
be explained as a heterozygous deletion combined with 60%
tumor purity. Resolving this ambiguity is key to accurate esti-
mation of tumor purity and ploidy. Existing methods try to solve
this identiﬁability problem by using heuristics, e.g. favoring so-
lutions that have the smallest deviations from diploid (e.g.
CNAnorm; Gusnanto et al., 2012), seeking additional experien-
tial data (e.g. ABSOLUTE; Carter et al., 2012) or simply out-
putting all possible solutions (e.g. THetA; Oesper et al., 2013).

Here we provide a more principled way to solve the identiﬁa-
bility problem by combining the information revealed from copy
number changes and B-allele frequencies. Instead of using B-
allele frequencies extracted from somatic mutation sites as in
the previous cases, we use B-allele frequencies calculated at
sites that are heterozygous with respect to the normal genomes,
and most of which are common single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). These heterozygous sites are much more abundant
(Sachidanandam et al., 2001) and easier to identify, leading to
more statistically stable results. Copy number changes in the
cancer genome often result in loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at
these heterozygous sites, and the extent of LOH is closely related
to absolute instead of relative copy number changes. We will use
BAFs to gauge the extent of LOH, and provide information on
the absolute copy number changes by examining the patterns of
BAFs at the heterozygous sites within the same genomic seg-
ment. For example, although a homozygous deletion with 30%
tumor purity results in the same copy number as a heterozygous
deletion with 60% tumor purity in a tumor sample, B-allele
frequencies at heterozygous sites of the tumor sample cluster at
different values in the two combinations and therefore are able to
distinguish these two cases. Based on this insight, we propose a
full probabilistic model implemented as a software package
called PyLOH to integrate the information gathered from
CNAs and LOH. Estimations of tumor purity and absolute
copy numbers are then formulated as an optimization problem
in which we choose those values that maximally explain both
total read counts and B-allele frequency information.

Our method is similar in spirit to some of the earlier methods
proposed for SNP array analysis, where both the signal intensity
and BAF of each SNP are used in estimating copy number
changes. The combination of these two signals has been shown
to improve the estimation accuracy of tumor ploidy (Greenman
et al., 2010), or both tumor purity and ploidy (Rasmussen et al.,
2011; Van Loo et al., 2010; Yau et al., 2010). Recently, some of
these methods have been extended to sequencing data, including
OncoSNP-SEQ by Yau (2013) and Patchwork by Mayrhofer
et al. (2013). However, the OncoSNP-SEQ algorithm uses only
the reads mapped to the SNP sites, although our algorithm uses
all reads, and thus should be able to yield a more accurate esti-
mation of copy number changes. Similar to our work, the
Patchwork algorithm also uses all reads, but it requires manual
interpretation through data Visualization to determine the initial
copy numbers of clusters of genomic segments, which could be
useful when the tumor genome is too complex for the algorithms
to resolve different solutions by themselves. Here we seek an
alterative approach that is based on a generative model and re-
quires no manual intervention. In addition, the Patchwork algo-
rithm requires the existence of copy-neutral loss of
heterozygosity within the tumor genome to run the algorithm,
whereas our algorithm has no such constraints.

The outline of this article is as follows: in Section 2, we de-
scribe the full probabilistic model of PyLOH. In Section 3, we
first present cluster patterns of BAFs in NGS data of paired
tumor-normal samples, then introduce a Visualization tool
called ‘BAF heat map’ to characterize such patterns. Finally,
we compare tumor purity estimates of PyLOH and other meth-
ods on both simulated datasets and 12 breast cancer sequencing
datasets. Our results show that explicitly incorporating both
CNAs and LOH information can resolve the identiﬁability prob-
lem and signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of tumor purity esti-
mation. Finally, we discuss the limitations of PyLOH and
propose future directions in Section 4.

2 METHODS

In this section, we present the probabilistic model of PyLOH that com-
bines CNAs and LOH information to infer absolute copy numbers and
tumor purity. We ﬁrst introduce some notations, then propose a genera-
tive mixture model incorporating both total read counts and B-allele
frequency information and ﬁnally introduce algorithms to solve the
model.

2.1 Basic deﬁnitions and notations

Similar to previous work (Carter et al., 2012; Oesper et al., 2013), we
assume the tumor genome has already been segmented into J segments,
each of which has the same CNAs. Denote the copy number of the j-th
segment of the tumor genome by C, with j = 1, . . . ,J. In addition, we
assume each segment has a number of heterozygous sites (single nucleo-
tide changes) in the corresponding normal (i.e. control) genome. We use
(1,1) to index the i-th heterozygous site in segment j with i: 1, . . . ,1],
where  is the total number of heterozygous sites in segment j.

The observed data are summarized and grouped into two categories:
one category is the copy number information, represented as the total
number of reads mapped to each segment. Let 0, denote the number of
reads mapped to segment j. The second category of observed data is the
allele frequency information, represented by the total number of reads
matching each of two alleles at a heterozygous site. For notational

purpose, for each heterozygous site, we deﬁne the A allele to be the allele
matching the reference genome and the B allele to be the corresponding
unmatched one. Using the notation from (Roth et al., 2012), let a,-/ and bi,
denote the number of reads matching A and B alleles, respectively, at site
(i,j). As most of the data we consider are from paired tumorinormal
samples, we use a superscript N (from normal samples) and T (from
tumor samples) to denote the sample origin of the data. For example,
D} and D1” will denote the total number of reads mapped to segment j
from the tumor and normal samples, respectively.

To account for the contamination of normal cells, we assume the
tumor sample yielding the sequence data consists of a mixture of nor-
mal and tumor cells. Denote the fraction of tumor cells within the
tumor sample by d), which will also be called tumor purity.
Consequently, the average copy number of each segment within the
tumor sample is

€1=¢Cj+(1-¢)2 (1)

for j = 1, . . . ,J, assuming that the default copy number within normal
cells is always 2. Our goal is to use both the total read count information
and site-speciﬁc allele count information to infer both the absolute copy
number {C1, . . . , CJ} and the tumor purity d).

2.2 Modeling CN As

Following the Lander7Waterman theory (Lander and Waterman, 1988),
the probability of a read originating from a speciﬁc segment depends on
three main factors: (i) the copy number of the segment, (ii) the total
genomic length of the segment and (iii) the mappability of the segment
(depending on factors such as GC content, repetitive sequence and so on)
(Oesper et al., 2013). Borrowing the concept of interval weight factor
from (Oesper et al., 2013), we associate a coefﬁcient 61- to segment j ac-
counting for the effect of its genomic length and mappability. We assume
the expected number of reads mapped to segment j, denoted by A, in the
tumor sample is proportional to  That is, given two segments a and b,
we have

M_G&

A‘b — C'be

 

(2)

In Equation (2), the mapping coefﬁcient 617s matters only in their
relative values. For simplicity, we take 01/6,, 2 Dav/D”, the ratio of the
mapped read counts between these two segments in the normal sample, as
it reﬂects intrinsic sequence properties of these segments and therefore
should be the same between the normal and tumor samples.

The above formula determines the relative value of the expected
number of reads mapped to each segment. To further specify the absolute
value of M of segment j, we make use of the allele frequency information
and curate a list of segments that contain no loss of heterozygosity.
Where there is no loss of heterozygosity, the only possible copy numbers
at these segments in tumor cells must be even numbers. From the list, we
further remove ‘outlier’ segments whose copy numbers deviate from the
bulk of the segments in the list based on the observed read counts at these
segments. At the end, we are left with a set of segments (denoted by set S
containing the indices of these segments) that both contain no loss of
heterozygosity and likely share the same copy number. Details are given
in Supplementary Material Data preprocessing.

The set of segments in S will be the baseline segments that we use to
specify the expected read counts Ajs. To reduce complexity, we assume
that the same even copy number c, shared by all segments in S can only
be either 2 or 4. (The other possible values are 0 for homozygous deletion,
which is unlikely, as each segment in S is supported by a certain amount
of reads, or values that are >4 for ploidy higher than tetraploid, which is
likely to be rare.) Our algorithm will check both cases and select the one
most compatible with the observed data (in terms of the likelihood f unc-
tion). Given the values of css for each s e S, the average copy number of

these segments in the tumor sample, taking the contamination of normal
cells into account, is then given by Equation (1).

With the average copy numbers in the baseline segments given, we then
specify the expected read count for each segment j = 1, . . . , J in the tumor
sample as follows:

 

1 C19} T
timéaa“ m
which is the average expected read count suggested by the baseline seg-
ments through Equation (2), where the observed read counts in segment s
of the tumor sample are denoted as DST. Here |S| denotes the number of
segments in set S.
Given the expected read count at each segment, we model the prob-
ability of observing DjT reads in segment j as a Poisson distribution with
parameter A -,

of | q, ¢ ~ Poisson(Aj) (4)

for each j = 1,. . .,J, where M is a parameter depending on the abso-
lute copy numbers and is calculated based on Equation (3). More discus-
sion about using the Poisson distribution is given in Supplementary
Material.

2.3 Modeling loss of heterozygosity

To model the loss of heterozygosity at heterozygous sites (i.e. with geno-
type AB in the normal cells), we need to consider the genotypes of these
sites in tumor cells. Let

g = {0, A, B, AA, AB, BB, AAB, ABB, AABB}

be the set of possible genotypes that we will consider at each heterozygous
site in tumor cells. By focusing on this set, we have excluded some other
genotypes that are less likely to occur in tumor cells. For instance, we will
not consider genotypes AAA or BBB, as any copy number change from
AB to these two genotypes will involve at least one deletion and two
insertions. Instead, all genotypes included in Q can be derived from AB
with a minimum of one operation on each allele. Although we formulated
the set of possible genotypes here by assuming the maximum copy
number of each allele is 2 in tumor cells, PyLOH allows the user to
change this value. However, there is a trade-off in choosing the maximum
copy number threshold. On one hand, increasing the threshold can ac-
commodate genomes with high instability, but on the other hand, it can
also significantly increase the complexity of the model and thus make it
more susceptible to overﬁtting.

The corresponding copy number and BAFs associated with each geno-
type in g are {0,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4} and {%,e, 1 — 6,6, %,1 — e, %, g, %}, re-
spectively, written in the same order as the genotypes in set Q. We have
included a small e «1 in the calculation of BAF to account for sequen-
cing and/or read-mapping biases or errors. In practice, we choose
6 = 0.01, corresponding to a Phred quality score of 20 (Ewing and
Green, 1998). We will use ng and Mg to denote the corresponding copy
number and BAF, respectively, for genotype g.

As the tumor sample consists of a mixture of normal and tumor cells,
the fraction of B alleles in the tumor sample is the weighted average of
BAFs between normal and tumor cells, with weights depending on tumor
purity d) and copy numbers,

I; = (brig/14g + (1 _ ¢)2M0
g Wig + (1 — (2)2

where a0 = 0.5 is the BAF at the heterozygous sites in normal cells.
Using the notation from (Roth et al., 2012), let G,, be a random vari-
able denoting the genotype of site (i,j) in tumor cells. Conditional on its
genotype, we model the probability of the B allele count at each site as a
binomial distribution, that is, given  = aijT. + bijT. reads mapped to site

(i,j), the chance of observing bijT. reads matching B allele is given by the
equation

I

with the total number of trials speciﬁed by  and the chance of success at
each trial speciﬁed by 12g.

2.4 Combining CNAs and LOH information

For heterozygous sites located within the same segment, their genotypes
are constrained by the underlying copy number associated with the seg-
ment. We model this constraint through a conditional probability distri-
bution P(G,-, = g|C, = c) = Qgc for all i and j. Here Qgc is a predeﬁned
matrix specifying the chance of a site being genotype g conditional on the
underlying copy number being c. In practice, we assign a small probabil-
ity a to any genotypes incompatible with the copy number c conditional
on the heterozygosity in normal cells, and equal probabilities to other
compatible genotypes.

Conditional on the underlying copy number, we can then write
down the probability of observing B-allele read count at each site as
follows:

P(b,-,T-le = c. ¢) = Z Qgc P(b,-,T-|Gij = g. ¢)

gEg

We will assume that conditional on the underlying copy number, the
B-allele read counts at different sites of the same segment are independent
of each other and are independent of the total read count from the seg-
ment. Let bf = (bT, . . . ,bITf) denote all B-allele read counts at heterozy-
gous sites of segment j. Under the conditional independence assumption
outlined above, the joint probability of observing D} and bf conditional
on the underlying copy number C,= c and the tumor purity being d) is as
follows:

P(D-T,b,-TIC,- = c. ¢) = P(D,-TIC,- = c. ¢)
 T (7)
x 1‘1 Z 9,. Pa),- iGij = g. a

i:1 geg

where the probability of DT conditional on C, and d) is the Poisson dis-
tribution (4), and the probability of bijT. conditional on G,, and d) is the
binomial distribution (6).

2.5 Likelihood model

So far, we have speciﬁed the probability of observing total read count and
site-speciﬁc B-allele read counts at each segment conditional on the
underlying copy number. Next we further treat the copy number C, at
each segment as a random variable, and model its probability as a cat-
egorical distribution with support C = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, denoting the range of
considered copy numbers, and parameters p, 2 (p10, . . . , p14), where [0,.
denotes the probability of having  = c in segment j. In other words, we
have

C, | p, ~ Categorical(C, p,) (8)

for eachj=1,...,J.

We treat p = (p1,...,pj) and d) as parameters of our model
6 = (d), p), and the goal of our model is to infer the values of these
parameters based on the total read count information in each segment
and site-speciﬁc allele count information at each heterozygous site of
these segments. Let D = (D1,...,DJ) and b = (b1,...,bJ). By
Equation (7), and assuming the observations from different segments
are conditionally independent conditional on the tumor purity d), the

likelihood of observing the combined read count information is then
given as follows:

I

P(D.bi¢>.p) = 1‘1 ZP(C,- = cipj)P(D,-T.b,-TIC,- = c. :1»

J Alp/TeiA, If  _b-7I- _ “T

j:l L'EC f ' i=1 gEQ ij

Given the likelihood function, we can then estimate the model param-
eters using maximum likelihood estimation. Alternatively, we can also
add a prior into the model by incorporating our prior knowledge on
the copy numbers and/or tumor purity. For instance, we can use the
Dirichlet distribution to incorporate the prior on the distribution of
copy numbers and beta distribution to incorporate the prior on tumor
purity,

p, ~ Dirichlet(w), d) ~ Beta(a, ,8) (10)

where a) is a vector having the same dimension as p, and gives a weight to
each copy number. If the priors are speciﬁed, we can then estimate the
values of the parameters by maximizing their posterior probability, i.e.
using the method of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. In this
article, we use non-informative prior for d) and a Dirichlet prior conﬁg-
ured based on the compatible genotypes of each copy number for 9,. We
solve the MAP problem using the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
framework (Dempster et al., 1977). An alternative approach would be
to take a Bayesian approach to calculate the posterior probabilities of the
tumor purity and copy number changes. We do not take the Bayesian
approach owing to computational considerations, as it would require
more time-consuming inference procedures. The complete details about
prior conﬁgurations and EM updates are given in Supplementary
Material.

3 RESULTS

Next we demonstrate the utility of combining loss of heterozy-
gosity with CNAs to infer tumor purity and ploidy. For this
purpose, we ﬁrst present a clustering pattern of B-allele frequen-
cies derived from NGS data in paired tumor-normal samples.
Then we show that this clustering pattern can be used to resolve
the ambiguous combinations of tumor purity and copy number
changes, using both a toy example and real data. Afterward, we
apply our method PyLOH, developed to infer tumor purity and
absolute copy numbers by integrating the information from total
read counts and B-allele frequencies, to simulated data and com-
pare its performance with exiting state-of—the-art methods,
CNAnorm-1.4.0 (Gusnanto et al., 2012), THetA-0.0.3 (Oesper
et al., 2013) and PurBayes-1.3 (Larson and Fridley, 2013).
Finally, we test the performance of our methods and other
methods on real data, consisting of 12 whole genome
sequencing datasets from breast cancer samples (Banerji et al.,
2012).

3.1 BAFs patterns in NGS data and BAF heat map

As discussed in the introduction, the distribution of BAFs is
closely related to the underlying copy number changes. In par-
ticular, copy number changes at sites that are heterozygous with
respect to the normal genome may result in a deviation of the
BAFs from 0.5 (loss of heterozygosity), and the extent of this
deviation depends on the absolute copy number changes and
tumor purity. We illustrate this idea using a heat map plot

segment

(Fig. 1), which shows the frequencies of BAF pairs, with one
calculated from the normal sample and the other calculated
from the matched tumor sample at the same site, coded in
pseudo colors. Figure 1 shows the BAF heat maps of paired
tumorenormal samples from three independent cancer genome
NGS datasets, including both exome sequencing (Biankin et al.,
2012; Zang et al., 2012) and whole genome sequencing (Banerji
et al., 2012).

The BAF heat maps demonstrate a clear cluster pattern on the
distribution of BAF pairs (Fig. 1). Two clusters are shared by all
four heat maps, including the bottom left cluster, containing sites
with homozygous A-allele in both normal and tumor genomes,
and the top right cluster, containing sites with homozygous B-
allele in both normal and tumor genomes. (The small deviations
of BAFs away from 0 or 1 of sites in these two clusters are likely
because of sequencing and/or read-mapping errors.) Without
changes in BAFs, these two clusters reveal no information with
regard to the underlying copy number changes. Thus, we focus
our attention on the other clusters in the heat maps, which all
have BAFs centering at 0.5 in the normal samples, and thus
contain mostly the heterozygous sites that underscore our
method. For this reason, these clusters will be referred to as
heterozygous clusters in the following.

The heterozygous clusters demonstrate distinct cluster patterns
in different genomic segments of same/different samples.
Although the BAFs of these clusters all center at 0.5 in the
normal samples, the BAFs of the corresponding matched
tumor samples can center at 0.5 (Fig. 1c and d) or at values

Fig. 2. A toy example illustrating the utility of BAFs patterns in resolving
the identiﬁability problem

away from 0.5 (Fig. laec). In fact, these values provide a measure
on the extent of LOH in the segments of tumor samples. For
example, the tumor BAFs of the heterozygous cluster center at
0.5 in Figure 1d, suggesting no loss of heterozygosity in this
segment. Without LOH, the absolute copy number in this case
can only be even numbers, with diploid being the most plausible
answer. (We can eliminate homozygous deletion, as there are
reads mapped to this region.)

A different cluster pattern emerges in Figure 1a and b, which
show two heterozygous clusters, with tumor BAFs centering at
0.1 and 0.9 in Figure 1a, and at 0.2 and 0.8 in Figure 1b, sug-
gesting signiﬁcant loss of heterozygosity in these two segments.
(The appearance of two heterozygous clusters in these two cases
and the symmetry of the two clusters with respect to the tumor
BAF: 0.5. This is because the B-alleles are determined accord-
ing to the human reference genome, which is not phased.) If the
underlying copy number changes are a single-copy deletion in
both cases, then the cluster with tumor BAFs centering at 0.1
(Fig. 1a) would correspond to a larger LOH, and consequently a
higher tumor purity than the other case (Fig. 1b).

Figure 1c shows an interesting case with three heterozygous
clusters with one center cluster showing no LOH and two sym-
metric clusters suggesting LOHs. This more complex cluster pat-
tern suggests more than one type of CNAs within the segment
being considered, most likely owing to the presence of both dip-
loid and single-copy deletion changes.

Overall, these BAF heat maps provide a convenient and intui-
tive way to examine the overall CNAs of a chromosomal seg-
ment, and illustrate the utility of BAFs at heterozygous sites for
inferring tumor purity and absolute copy numbers.

3.2 Using BAFs to solve the identiﬁability problem

The BAF patterns shown in Figure 1 can be used to resolve the
identiﬁability problem, as the heterozygous clusters in each BAF
heat map will center at different values with respect to different
combinations of tumor purity and copy number changes. We
demonstrate this idea using a toy example (Fig. 2). In this ex-
ample, we have total read counts in two segments of the genome
from both normal and tumor samples. The segment 2 has much
smaller total read counts from the tumor sample than the normal
sample. The differences can be explained by either a heterozy-
gous deletion with 60% tumor purity or a homozygous deletion

with 30% tumor purity in this segment. The total read counts
themselves cannot distinguish these two possibilities. However, if
we add in the information from the BAFs of the sites in segment
2, an observation of heterozygous clusters centering at tumor
BAFs away from 0.5 would eliminate the homozygous deletion
solution (Fig. 2).

We can observe similar cases in real cancer genome sequencing
data as those in the above toy example. For instance, Table 1
shows the total read counts and BAFs at three SNP sites [dbSNP
130 ID listed (Sherry et al., 2001)] observed in the exome sequen-
cing of a breast cancer patient MB-154 (Banerji et al., 2012). The
mean coverage of the exome sequencing data was 141X for the
tumor samples and 133X for the normal samples, respectively
(Banerji et al., 2012). The first SNP site shows an example of a
heterozygous deletion as dT is significantly lower than dN, where-
as BAFT signiﬁcantly deviates from 0.5. The second site shows an
example of a homozygous deletion as dT is signiﬁcantly lower
than dN, whereas BAFT is around 0.5. As a control, the third site
shows an example without LOH or CNAs.

3.3 Results from simulated data

We have developed a probabilistic model to infer tumor purity
and absolute copy numbers by integrating the LOH information
described above and the information based on total read counts
(see Section 2). Next we benchmark the performance of our new
method on simulated data and compare it with other algorithms.
By using simulated data, we know the ground truth of both
tumor purity and absolute copy numbers, thereby providing us
an objective way of comparing the performance of different
algorithms.

We first created an artiﬁcial diploid human genome by using
the human reference genome as a template and inserting SNP
sites with a frequency similar to those observed in the human
population (Sachidanandam et al., 2001). This diploid genome
will be treated as the normal genome in our follow-up simulation
and analysis. The tumor genome was generated by adding som-
atic mutations and copy number changes to the normal genome.
NGS reads were then simulated from the tumor sample consist-
ing of a mixture of the normal and tumor genome, with the
fraction of the tumor genome determined by the tumor purity.
To reduce computational time, we use only data from chromo-
some 1 in our analysis. Details on how the genomes and reads
were generated are described in Supplementary Material.

We created four tumor genomes that differ in their copy
number conﬁgurations. The absolute copy numbers of each
tumor genome were conﬁgured to introduce the identiﬁability
problem, and the detailed conﬁgurations are given in
Supplementary Table S1. For each tumor genome, we then simu-
lated eight different sets of NGS reads from both normal and
tumor samples by varying tumor purity. Overall, 32 sets of
paired tumor-normal reads, each with 60X coverage, were gen-
erated. We applied PyLOH to each of these datasets, and com-
pared its performance with three other methods, including
PurBayes, CNAnorm and THetA. THetA and PyLOH require
a segmentation of the tumor genome based on relative CNAs as
an input. To avoid issues related to genome segmentation, we
used ground truth segmentations in our analyses. Similarly, we
used ground truth somatic mutation sites as the input for
PurBayes. Details on how reads were preprocessed are given in
Supplementary Material.

The tumor purities estimated by PyLOH and three other exist-
ing methods are shown in Figure 3. Because of the space limita-
tion, we only show the results of the ﬁrst three simulated datasets
in Figure 3. The complete tumor purity estimates for all the
simulated datasets are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The
absolute copy numbers estimated by PyLOH and THetA for
each simulated dataset are shown in Supplementary Tables
S4mS7. A few observations emerge from the ﬁgure and tables.
First, PyLOH signiﬁcantly outperforms the other three methods
on these datasets, providing a more accurate estimation of both
tumor purity and absolute copy numbers and returning ground
true values in most of the tested cases. Second, the THetA
method, based only on total read counts information, is able
to identify the ground truth as one of its possible solutions for
tumor genomes 1 and 2 but fails to resolve the identiﬁability
problem. Finally, the PurBayes method, based on information
from somatic mutations, can return the true tumor purity in
some cases, but has larger deviations than PyLOH, likely reﬂect-
ing the statistical ﬂuctuation associated with relatively small
number of somatic mutation sites.

In addition to the four simulated tumor genomes discussed
above, we simulated two additional tumor genomes based on
copy number conﬁgurations derived from Sanger COSMIC
V68 (Forbes et al., 2011). The tumor purities and absolute copy
numbers of the two COSMIC samples estimated by PyLOH and
other methods are shown in Supplementary Tables S97S11.
PyLOH still outperformed the other methods on these two
new datasets. Further details on these two datasets are described
in Supplementary Material.

3.4 Results from breast cancer sequencing data

Having illustrated the utility of our method on simulated data,
we proceed to test the performance of PyLOH on a real cancer
genome dataset, consisting of whole genome sequencing of 12
breast cancer samples (Banerji et al., 2012). As the ground truth
tumor purities are unknown for this dataset, we used the tumor
purities calculated by ABSOLUTE based on SNP array data and
reported in the paper by Banerji et al. (2012) as a baseline for our
comparison. Although this baseline is by no means absolutely
correct, it offers clues on the performance of different algorithms,
as it was derived from SNP array data instead of NGS data as in

“THetA outputted multiple solutions and here we only show the solutions with the
smallest deviation from the diploid. bFor tumor purities reported by THetA with
multiple solutions, we used the average of the solutions with the smallest deviation
from the diploid to calculate the MAE.

our case. We used BIC-seq-1.2.1 0(i et al., 2011) to obtain seg-
mentation ﬁles for THetA and PyLOH, and used VarScan-2.3.5
(Koboldt et al., 2012) to call somatic mutation sites for
PurBayes. As THetA often outputs multiple solutions, we se-
lected the ones with the smallest deviation from the diploid
whenever this happens, as recommended by THetA (Oesper
et al., 2013). Further details on this dataset are described in
Supplementary Material.

The tumor purities estimated by PyLOH and three existing
algorithms, THetA, CNAnorm and PurBayes, for the 12 breast
cancer sequencing datasets are summarized in Table 2. If the
tumor purities estimated by ABSOLUTE are used as our com-
parison baseline, we find PyLOH to be the most accurate algo-
rithm among the fouriit yields a mean absolute error (MAE) of
0.186, as compared with a MAE of 0.22 by the second best

algorithm, THetA. PurBayes, which uses somatic mutations to
estimate tumor purity, produced poorest results, likely because of
the inclusion of false-positive results in the somatic mutation
calling procedure.

Although PyLOH returned closer solutions to ABSOLUTE
(as measured by MAE) than any of the other methods, the
tumor purities estimated by PyLOH and ABSOLUTE deviate
in six samples: MB-15, MB-45, MB-82, MB-98, MB-116 and
MB-123. To ﬁnd out why such a discrepancy arises, we carefully
studied each of these six cases. In two of these cases GVIB-15 and
MB-45), we believe that the results obtained by PyLOH are more
accurate because the tumor purities and absolute copy numbers
inferred by total read counts information are consistent with
those inferred by BAFs information, and both support the re-
sults obtained by PyLOH. For sample MB-82, MB-116 and MB-
123, the contribution of BAFs information to estimating tumor
purities is not significant compared with the total read count
information, likely because of a low tumor purity in these sam-
ples. As a result, the estimation of tumor purity is mainly con-
tributed by information from total read counts, and in fact
produces a similar estimation compared with THetA. For the
remaining case MB-98, the estimated tumor purities given by
the four algorithms are all inconsistentione possible reason
for this may be the existence of subclonal tumor populations in
the tumor sample.

Aside from the accuracy comparison described above, we note
that PyLOH is fast, with a running time scaling linearly with the
number of segments. This is in contrast to the THetA method,
the running time of which scales exponentially with the number
of segments, as it explores all combinations of copy number
changes across all segments (Oesper et al., 2013). As a result,
THetA takes a prohibitively long time to run when the number
of segments is above 150 and the maximum copy number is >6,
although PyLOH has no such constraints. Further details about
the run time of each algorithm are given in Supplementary
Material.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we examined the problem of estimating tumor
purity and absolute copy number changes from NGS data,

and, in particular, focused on solving the identifiability problem
that has not been properly solved by the existing methods. We
demonstrated that the distribution of B-allele frequencies at sites
that are heterozygous with respect to the normal genome pro-
vides key, but under used, information to solve the identifiability
problem. We further developed a full probabilistic model to in-
tegrate the copy number change and BAF information, and
derived a principled way to estimate tumor purity and absolute
CNAs. We benchmarked the performance of our method,
PyLOH, on both simulated data and real whole genome sequen-
cing data, showing that our method outperforms existing meth-
ods in both cases.

PyLOH requires a segmentation of the genome into segments
with different CNAs as input. Many algorithms have been de-
veloped to segment genomes based on copy number changes and
BAFs of SNP array data with varying levels of accuracy (Olshen
et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2009; Van Loo et al., 2010; Yau et al.,
2010). A few of these array-based methods have recently been
translated to the sequencing domain (Mayrhofer et al., 2013;
Yau, 2013). A future direction of PyLOH would be to integrate
these existing methodologies and combine them with the prob-
abilistic model of PyLOH to carry out both genome segmenta-
tion and absolute copy number estimation.

Another important future direction is to use our model to
study tumor heterogeneity. So far, we have focused on separating
genetic changes from a mixture of normal and tumor cells. It is
well known that multiple tumor clonal types may coexist in the
tumor sample, each with an associated mutation landscape
(Parsons, 2008). To further model intra-tumor heterogeneity on
top of the current probabilistic framework, we can assume there
are multiple populations of tumor cells. Thus, the model likeli-
hood given by Equation (9) can be extended to account for
subclonal tumor populations (details in Supplementary
Material). We plan to further extend PyLOH in this direction
to tackle the more challenging problem of deconvolving tumor
heterogeneity by combining copy number change and allele fre-
quency information.

FindPath - In silico design of synthetic metabolic pathways

 

SBML format. A user manual is provided in Supplementary
Materials.

A schematic diagram of the computational workﬂow of
FindPath is given in Supplementary Figure S1 and is described
step by step in the following sections.

2.2 Creation of the substrate-associated reaction database

FindPath requires a dedicated substrate—associated reaction
(SAR) database including all the reactions and processes
involved in the metabolic conversion of the compound of interest
(see Supplementary Fig. S1A). This information can be extracted
from metabolic databases such as MetaCyc (Karp et al., 2002) or
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2008) or from the literature. The SAR
database can be generated manually (See Supplementary Data).
The reactions included in the database must be balanced, generic
reactions must be instanced and reversibility of each reaction
must be given. To ensure full compatibility between the different
tools, the identiflers of metabolites and reactions in the SAR
database and in the host organism CBM must be uniﬁed and
must respect the COBRA—toolbox formalism.

2.3 Prediction of possible pathways

FindPath predicts possible pathways capable of converting the
novel compound into any host metabolites by elementary flux
mode (EFM) analysis (Klamt and Stelling, 2003). To this end,
the information contained in the SAR database is converted into
an SAR model (see Supplementary Fig. SlB and Supplementary
Materials). The resulting SAR model is then converted by
FindPath into the EFMTool format (Klamt and Gilles, 2004)
by linking all equivalent flelds (stoichiometric matrix, list of re—
actions list of reactions list, reversibility, etc.). The input metab—
olite is the novel compound to be converted. The output
metabolites are all host metabolites, but a subset of host metab—
olites can be speciﬁed as output metabolites when appropriate
(e.g. to exclude cofactors or undesired intermediates). All the
resulting EFMs enabling the conversion of the novel compounds
into a host metabolite are considered as possible solutions. Using
this process, both naturally occurring pathways and pathways
resulting from novel combinations of reactionsiie. synthetic
pathwayswan be predicted.

2.4 Prioritization of pathways

Depending on the number of reactions in the SAR database, the
number of pathways predicted by FindPath may increase dra—
matically. FindPath makes it possible to prioritize the different
pathways based on two criteria: the length of the pathway and
the metabolite composition of the pathway (see Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Short pathways reduce both the genetic effort needed
to construct the strain and the energetic costs related to the bio—
synthesis and maintenance of enzymes (Medema et al., 2012).
The second criterion helps prioritize pathways according to
metabolic considerations, e. g. selecting pathways containing me—
tabolites of interest or discarding pathways containing toxic
compounds. The pathways selected during this step are kept
for the next step.

2.5 Ranking of selected pathways

For each pathway selected, FindPath creates a speciﬁc pathway/
organism CBM by incorporating the pathway reactions into the
genome—scale model of the selected host. Constraints on these
newly added reactions (i.e. upper and lower bound of the ﬂux)
can be set by the user or an arbitrary range can be automatically
applied by the COBRA—Toolbox functions. For each model,
FBA is performed after an objective function corresponding to
the desired metabolic capability (e.g. production of biomass or
product of interest, etc.) has been deﬁned in the model. To de—
termine the best trade—off between genetic effort and metabolic
efflciency, pathways are ranked based on a weighted score that
accounts for both pathway length (i.e. data obtained during the
previous step) and efﬁciency (i.e. results of the FBA) (see
Supplementary Fig. S1D and Supplementary Materials). The
weight of each parameter can be deﬁned by the user. This
allows long pathways with high productivity to be selected
over short pathways with low productivity. Results are exported
to SBML ﬁle to ensure the data produced are fully compatible
when incorporated in a larger workflow and in a log file. The
number of pathways to be exported can be speciﬁed by the user.

3 TEST CASE

As proof of concept, FindPath was used to select the best path—
ways to enable growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on D—xylose.
Although this sugar is one of the main monomers present in
lignocellulosic hydrolysates, S.cerevisiae is unable to grow on
or consume it (Kim et al., 2013). To achieve economically
viable ethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstocks, it is
essential to generate a pentose using yeast, and this is the focus
of many current studies. Starting with an SAR database of 29
reactions and a genome—scale model of 1412 reactions, i.e.
iMM904 (Zomorrodi and Maranas, 2010), FindPath was able
to identify 15 potential pathways in <1 min in an XEON E5410
(8 cores) and 16GB of RAM. Interestingly, the two pathways
with the highest scores matched the pathways (i.e. xylose isom—
erase and xylulose kinase (XK) or xylose reductase, xylitol de—
hydrogenase and XK) that were successfully used to obtain a
xylose—fermenting S.cerevisiae strain (Kim et al., 2013). More
details can be found in Supplementary Materials.

4 CONCLUSION

FindPath is a simple unifled workﬂow for the in silico design of
pathways to convert novel compounds into any host metabolites.
FindPath rapidly identiﬁes the best solution but also alternative
solutions with topological and efﬁciency interest. It provides
additional features to the COBRA—Toolbox and can also be
used in additionior in parallelito other computational tools
that accept SBML formats. FindPath is a ﬂexible tool that can
be used for many purposes, including: (i) prediction of pathways
involved in the conversion of a carbon source that is not natur—
ally consumed by the host organism; (ii) design of degradation
pathways for the detoxiﬁcation of toxic compounds; (iii) cur—
ation of CBMs, by providing candidate pathways when experi—
mental evidence points to metabolic conversion, but the pathway
has not been identiﬁed; and (iv) choice among a large set of

compounds, the most suitable starting compound (e.g. carbon
source) to achieve the high—yield synthesis of the desired product.
This new tool should speed up the development of efﬁcient mi—
crobial cell factories.

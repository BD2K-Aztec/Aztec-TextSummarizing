ABSTRACT

Summary: ExTopoDB is a publicly accessible database of
experimentally derived topological models of transmembrane
proteins. It contains information collected from studies in the
literature that report the use of biochemical methods for the
determination of the topology of a-helical transmembrane proteins.
Transmembrane protein topology is highly important in order to
understand their function and ExTopoDB provides an up to date,
complete and comprehensive dataset of experimentally determined
topologies of a-helical transmembrane proteins. Topological
information is combined with transmembrane topology prediction
resulting in more reliable topological models.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transmembrane proteins constitute ~20—30% of fully sequenced
proteomes and they form an important Class of proteins, as they are
crucial for a wide variety of cellular functions (Krogh et al., 2001).
In order to understand their function we must acquire knowledge
about their structure and topology across the membrane. However,
due to the difﬁculty of obtaining crystals of transmembrane proteins
suitable for crystallographic analyses, a small number of TM
proteins have known 3D structure, comprising about 1.5% of all
proteins with known 3D structure according to PDB (Berman
et (11., 2000). Therefore, biochemical and molecular biology methods
are routinely used to determine the topology of transmembrane
proteins. By topology, we refer to the knowledge of the number
and the exact localization of transmembrane segments, as well as
their orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer. We have to note
however that even in the case of known 3D structures, the exact
boundaries of the transmembrane segments cannot be determined
accurately (Lee, 2003). Biochemical methods include: techniques
of gene fusions, using enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase,
B-galactosidase, B-lactamase and various ﬂuorescent proteins,

detection of post-translational modiﬁcations such as glycosylation,
phosphorylation and biotinylation, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis,
proteolysis methods and epitope mapping techniques (van Geest and
Lolkema, 2000). Prior knowledge produced by such techniques is
combined with topology prediction methods resulting in improved
prediction performance (Bagos et al., 2006; Melen et al., 2003).
Although widely used prediction algorithms are based mainly on
machine-learning techniques, mostly Hidden Markov Models (Kall
et al., 2004; Krogh et al., 2001; Tusnady and Simon, 2001), during
the last few years ab initio topology prediction has been shown to be
an attainable goal since it yields comparable performance (Bernsel
et al., 2008; Hessa et al., 2007).

Although a large amount of information in the literature refers
to the determination of the topology of transmembrane proteins,
few efforts have been made in terms of collection of this data in a
database (Ikeda et al., 2003; Jayasinghe et (11., 2001; Lomize et al.,
2006; Moller et al., 2000; Tusnady et al., 2005, 2008). Most of
these databases are out of date and include small sets of proteins
with topologies determined either by X-ray crystallography (3D)
or by a combination of various biochemical methods. Here, we
report the construction of a database (ExTopoDB), which provides
detailed, experimentally veriﬁed, annotation of the topology of
ot-helical transmembrane proteins. In addition, we provide an
analysis showing the increase in the prediction performance using
topological data from ExTopoDB.

2 METHODS

In order to collect all available information about the topology of
OL-helical transmembrane proteins we performed an extensive literature
search (up to October 2009) in order to ﬁnd studies that reported the
use of biochemical methods for the determination of the topology of
transmembrane proteins. We searched PubMed using keywords such as
‘transmembrane’, ‘membrane’, ‘integral’, ‘gene fusion’, ‘phosphorylation’,
‘cysteine scanning’, ‘glycosylation’, ‘biotinylation’, ‘proteolysis’ and
‘epitope mapping’ combined every time with the term ‘topology’. Results
were manually ﬁltered as they contained a large number of false positive
hits in our search. Topology information was manually retrieved from 1200
studies. When a study reported topological information of a mutant protein
lacking its original activity, the study was excluded from the evaluation
process.

We deliberately did not include proteins with topology determined solely
by crystallography (3D structures), since these proteins are covered by
databases such as PDB_TM (Tusnady and Simon, 2001). However, there

are a large number of 3D structures in PDB that correspond to non-
transmembrane fragments of transmembrane proteins. This information was
included in ExTopoDB as additional topological information derived from
structure. The exact localization of soluble segments was obtained from the
articles where the structure was published. The total number of referenced
articles was raised this way to 1833. We also include annotation for signal
peptides, which is obtained either from Uniprot’s annotation (Bairoch at (11.,
2005) of the protein (when the signal peptide is experimentally veriﬁed)
or from a consensus of two of the top-scoring available predictors, SignalP
(Bendtsen at (11., 2004) and Phobius (Kall at (11., 2004).

The ExTopoDB web application (freely accessible at http://
bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/ExTopoDB) is based on the combination
of two layers: the underlying level is a Mysql database system which
contains all protein data and the upper layer is an Apache-PHP applications
server that receives user queries and fetches populated HTML data to
the web browser client. Protein information can be accessed through
four different entry View formats (FASTA, TEXT, TOPOLOGY, XML)
apart from the standard View. Detailed description and annotation of each
ExTopoDB entry can be found on the manual page of ExTopoDB.

In order to examine how information present in ExTopoDB may help to
calculate more accurate topological models we compared constrained (using
the information available in the database) and unconstrained predictions
for proteins present in ExTopoDB, that additionally, have a known 3D
structure deposited in PDB. For topology prediction we used TMHMMﬁx
(Melen at (11., 2003), HMM-TM (Bagos at (11., 2006), HMMTOP (Tusnady
and Simon, 2001) and PHOBIUS (Kall at (11., 2004), which allow the
incorporation of experimental information as constrains to the prediction
procedure. ExTopoDB holds 45 proteins with a PDB structure, which
includes the entire protein or a transmembrane fragment of it. Constrained
predictions were performed using the available topological information
for each protein, derived from the ExTopoDB database. To avoid biased
results and perform an independent analysis, we removed proteins that
were present in the training set of each prediction algorithm and performed
redundancy checks using BLAST (<30%) in order to create four different
non-redundant test sets. We came up with 31 proteins for TMHMMﬁx,
22 proteins for HMMTOP, 26 proteins for HMM-TM and 17 proteins for
PHOBIUS (Supplementary Table 1). We have to emphasize that the purpose
of this analysis was to evaluate the inﬂuence of incorporating topological
information present in ExTopoDB to prediction methods in general (since
data from ExTopoDB can be used in conjunction with every suitable
prediction algorithm) and not to compare the performance of the prediction
algorithms used. For the evaluation of the prediction performance in each
case we used the Mathew’s correlation coefﬁcient (C) and the percentage of
correctly predicted residues (Q) (Baldi at (11., 2000), as well as the segment
overlap (SOV) measure (Zemla at (11., 1999).

3 RESULTS

ExTopoDB contains topological information for 2143 ot-helical
transmembrane proteins originating from 158 different organisms.
The application possesses a user-friendly environment, through
which the user may retrieve the necessary information, ﬁnd available
resources and cross-references and perform additional tasks such
as running prediction algorithms. In the main page of ExTopoDB,
the user may ﬁnd links for the following tools: Navigation, Text
Search, BLAST Search and Download. Through the navigation tool,
the user has the ability to browse the database by organism or by
the experimental method that was used for the determination of
the topology of the protein entry. The user may submit advanced
queries for text search and there is an interface for running BLAST
against the database (Altschul et (11., 1997). Each record contains
information concerning the protein sequence with cross-references
to many publicly available databases. Furthermore, the results of

topology prediction using the HMM-TM algorithm (Bagos et (11.,
2006) are included for each protein in the database (unconstrained
prediction) and we also incorporated the experimental information
about the topology of the proteins, in the HMM-TM prediction
procedure, producing more reliable topology models (constrained
prediction). There is also an interface that allows user-deﬁned
constrained topology prediction using HMM-TM. Each record of
ExTopoDB contains the topological information in relation to the
experimental technique used and links to the Pubmed entry of each
study. The database can be downloaded in several formats through
the Download tool.

The incorporation of experimental information in the prediction
procedure improved the prediction performance for all measures
evaluated, whereas constrained predictions are more reliable
(Supplementary Table 2) as previously shown (Melen et (11., 2003).
Moreover, the fraction of correctly predicted residues (Q) increased,
for TMHMMﬁx from 0.838 to 0.858 (2%), for HMM-TM from
0.818 to 0.857 (3.9%), for HMMTOP from 0.788 to 0.861 (7.3%)
and for PHOBIUS from 0.874 to 0.884 (1%). The improvement
in the prediction performance is more evident in the number of
correctly predicted topologies, which perhaps is a metric with
increased practical importance. All four prediction methods improve
by ~30% in predicting the correct topology after the incorporation
of topology data from ExTopoDB (TMHMMﬁx 29.1%, HMM-TM
30.8%, HMMTOP 31.8%, PHOBIUS 35.3%). We also observe a
3—9% increase in the SOV measure (Supplementary Table 2), for
the different methods used.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we present a database, ExTopoDB, which is an up to
date collection of experimentally veriﬁed topological information
for ot-helical transmembrane proteins. Compared to similar data
sets, ExTopoDB contains the largest number of proteins with
topology information derived from 1833 studies. While developing
ExTopoDB a similar collection for transmembrane proteins,
TOPDB, was published in 2008 by Tusnady and coworkers (Tusnady
et (11., 2008). TOPDB contains records for 1497 transmembrane
proteins (1452 ot-helical TM proteins and 45 transmembrane
B-barrels) with information gathered from the literature and from
public databases and has not been updated since 2007. Though
TOPDB and ExTopoDB share the same scope, they have only 886
entries in common due to the different criteria used for inclusion.
Moreover, even for common entries, ExTopoDB holds a larger
number of experiments for each entry, as most information was
gathered from the literature (Table 1). Speciﬁcally, for the 886
common entries, ExTopoDB collects data from 387 published
studies, whereas TOPDB has information from only 181 studies
(Supplementary Table 3). Both databases include the study of Daley
and coworkers (Daley et (11., 2005), where C-terminal tagging
using alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) and green ﬂuorescent protein
(GFP) was used to establish periplasmic or cytoplasmic C-terminal
localization for 601 membrane proteins from Escherichia coli.
ExTopoDB holds data only for proteins where both a PhoA and
a GFP Clone was available. A large proportion (477 proteins) of the
886 common entries are derived from this study. On top of that,
in ExTopoDB there are an additional number of 152 independently
identiﬁed references for these 477 entries.

Chemical modiﬁcation experiments refer mostly to cysteine scanning mutagenesis
and post-translational modiﬁcation techniques include glycosylation, phosphorylation
and biotinylation analysis. ExTopoDB does not contain transmembrane proteins based
solely on the existence of known 3D structure, but only transmembrane proteins of
which a non-transmembrane fragment has been crystallized (*).

Fig. 1. Measures of accuracy obtained for constrained and unconstrained

Constrained predictions were performed using topology data from
ExTopoDB as described in the ‘Methods’ section.

Our analysis showed that topology data derived from ExTopoDB
can be used for generation of constrained predictions, which are
more reliable and more accurate at deﬁning the exact locations of the
transmembrane segments (Fig. 1). Similar results were also obtained
when we used for comparison the data deposited in the MPTOPO
database (Jayasinghe et (11., 2001), since we observe a high level of
agreement in the predicted topology for 31 out of 33 transmembrane
proteins with known 3D structure (Supplementary Table S4).

The database might be a valuable tool for researchers, in
order to design new experiments (Nilsson et (11 ., 2002) and for
bioinformaticians since it provides a large representative set that can
be used for training and testing prediction algorithms. For instance,
1056 out of the 2143 proteins have a reliability 395% (Melen et (11.,
2003) and among them, 798 are multispanning ones. Moreover,
topology data in ExTopoDB can be used for generating constrained

predictions using other methods such as TMHMMﬁx, HMMTOP
and PHOBIUS. Lastly, we have to mention that detailed knowledge
of topological information, coupled with prediction algorithms as
well as information concerning amino acid contacts derived from
biophysical experiments, can be used to calculate structural models
that closely resemble the 3D structure (Sorgen et (11., 2002). Thus,
such data can be of help in future structural studies. We plan to
update ExTopoDB once a year.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Rapid technological advances have led to an explosion of
biomedical data in recent years. The pace of change has inspired new
collaborative approaches for sharing materials and resources to help
train life scientists both in the use of cutting-edge bioinformatics tools
and databases and in how to analyse and interpret large datasets. A
prototype platform for sharing such training resources was recently
created by the Bioinformatics Training Network (BTN). Building on this
work, we have created a centralized portal for sharing training mater-
ials and courses, including a catalogue of trainers and course organ-
izers, and an announcement service for training events. For course
organizers, the portal provides opportunities to promote their training
events; for trainers, the portal offers an environment for sharing ma-
terials, for gaining visibility for their work and promoting their skills; for
trainees, it offers a convenient one-stop shop for finding suitable train-
ing resources and identifying relevant training events and activities
locally and worldwide.

1 INTRODUCTION

Technologies underpinning the life sciences are constantly evol-
ving (Abeln et al., 2013) and, at the same time, are spurring

development of new methods for data analysis and interpretation
(Carvalho and Rustici, 2013; Brazas and Ouellette, 2013;
Libeskind—Hadas and Bush, 2013). Researchersistudents and
professionals alikeitherefore constantly need to acquire new
skills to keep abreast of the latest developments (Schneider
et al., 2010; Via et al., 2011, 2013; Vincent and Page, 2013).
Attempting to address this need, the Global Organisation for
Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET)
has established a training portal, spanning the fields of bioinfor-
matics, biocuration, biocomputing and computational biology.
The portal provides a freely available collection of materials and
courses, and a catalogue of trainers, classiﬁed by tags. The tags
make it easy to ﬁnd and share materials and to identify trainers
with appropriate expertise. The portal inherits much of the func-
tionality of the prototype BTN website (Schneider et al., 2012),
extending its features to accommodate the diverse needs of global
communities of life scientists: enhancements include (i) the add-
ition of features such as the definition of ﬁelds for describing
materials, to make them more discoverable, and (ii) the possibil-
ity to add course pages, linked to their associated materials, so
that the portal is both a repository and a record of what is to be,
and what was, taught at a given time, rather than just a bag of
disconnected contents.

2 THE TRAINING PORTAL

The portal, built using the Drupal content management system,
embodies three main entities: members, materials and courses.
Members may be individuals representing their own interests, or
they may represent particular organizations or groups (national

Fig. 1. Filtering courses and materials using the audience tag ‘beginner bioinformatician’ retrieves 11 results. On the right-hand side, all available tags are
shown, with font sizes reﬂecting the relevance of the matched courses and materials

and/or international networks and societies, research institutes,
foundations, academic groups and so on).

Materials are available under a CC BY-SA 3.0 licence for
download and use, but materials and courses may currently be
uploaded only by registered members and/ or by GOBLET-
afﬁliated trainersiie. upload to the site requires registration
with the GOBLET Foundation (this helps to minimize spurious
entries and maintain quality standards). Materials may be pres-
entations, tutorials, datasets, case studies, curricula, etc.; courses
may be workshops, summer schools or road shows, and may be
linked to their respective materials once uploaded to the reposi-
tory. All contents are tagged: tags allow classiﬁcation or ﬁltering
of entities by keyword, making them easy to ﬁndithe main
content ﬁlters are currently ‘audience’ and ‘topic’. Figure 1
shows a ﬁltered View of courses and materials using audience
tag ‘beginner bioinformatician’. Audience tags are particularly
valuable because they pinpoint the level to which speciﬁc mater-
ials are geared. In addition to ﬁltering, a star-rating scheme can
be used to rank-order search results. The portal also provides a
catalogue of trainers, with information describing their fields of
expertise, and lists of their training materials and courses. This
registry of trainers and their learning resources may prove useful
for course or event organizers, wishing to identify trainers with
particular skill sets, and for students and learners looking to
acquire particular skills or techniques (here, the rating system
may help to guide their choice of materials). To date, 83 training
materials and courses have been uploaded to the portal, which
also contain proﬁle information on 66 registered trainers and
course organizers; it currently receives ~500-l- hits per day.

To augment its functionality, the portal is seamlessly inte-
grated with the iAnn platform (Jimenez et al., 2013), a distribu-
tion system for generic bioinformatics events around the world.
Several future enhancements are planned: among these, we are
devising an ontology to standardize the portal’s content tags. In
developing this ontology, we are collaborating with initiatives

like ELIXIR-UK to allow course providers to share information
in a standard manner, facilitating the distribution of this infor-
mation through third-party federated resources.

Overall, the portal offers an established, supported and sus-
tainable infrastructure for individuals, groups, organizations,
projects, etc., that are routinely producing training materials
and courses, but have no framework for organizing or storing
their content: e. g. the AllBio consortium recently saw the advan-
tage of exploiting the portal, rather than creating yet another
training resource that would be unsupported when project
funds cease.

3 CONCLUSIONS

The GOBLET training portal is a pioneering global initiative to
federate information relevant to bioinformatics, biocomputing,
biocuration and computational biology trainers, courses and ma-
terials. The contents are free to download, and are catalogued
according to topic and audience to enhance their discoverability.
The portal is an evolving resource, whose functionality and util-
ity will grow in harmony with the evolving needs of the global life
science research communities it serves, and synergistically with
bioinformatics training initiatives around the world.

ABSTRACT

Motivation The remodeling of short fragment(s) of the protein back-
bone to accommodate new function(s), fine-tune binding specificities
or change/create novel protein interactions is a common task in struc-
ture-based computational design. Alternative backbone conform-
ations can be generated de novo or by redeploying existing
fragments extracted from protein structures i.e. knowledge-based.
We present Frag’r’Us, a web server designed to sample alternative
protein backbone conformations in loop regions. The method relies on
a database of super secondary structural motifs called smotifs. Thus,
sampling of conformations reflects structurally feasible fragments
compiled from existing protein structures.

Availability and implementation Frag’r’Us has been implemented as
web application and is available at http://www.bioinsilico.org/

1 INTRODUCTION

Structural-based computational design aims to alter and change
the properties of proteins by using structural information. These
include improving protein stability, change and/or optimization
of catalytic activities, grafting of novel functionalities or altering
the binding to small molecules, nucleic acids or proteins [see
reviews (Khare and Fleishman, 2013; Kiss et al., 2013) and ref-
erences therein]. Pioneering approaches in the field were focused
in single amino acid changes with null or limited backbone ﬂexi-
bility (Lees et al., 2012). However, the remodeling and redesign
of short fragments of the protein backbone, i.e. de novo design,
overcomes the intrinsic limitations of fixed backbone design.
Recent works have shown the potential of de novo design
(Eiben et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2009).

The remodeling of the protein backbone usually occurs in the
loop regions, given its intrinsic ﬂexibility and variable nature.
Usually, remodeling the loop regions seeks to accommodate
speciﬁc interactions and restraints, e. g. catalytic residues

(Murphy et al., 2009), or to create new local segments (Hu
et al., 2007). The major limitation of de novo approaches is the
inherent combinatorial complexity that makes almost impossible
the systematic sampling of large insertions.

In early works we have described the use of motifs in loop
structure prediction [including protein kinases (Fernandez-
Fuentes et al., 2004)], functional annotation (Espadaler et al.,
2006) and prediction of proteiniprotein interactions (Planas-
Iglesias et al., 2013). Furthermore, we described that the dra-
matic increase of structures in the protein databank has resulted
in the saturation of sampling of loop structures, even in the case
of long loops (Bonet et al., 2014; Fernandez-Fuentes and Fiser,
2006) subsequently conﬁrmed (Choi and Deane, 2010), and that
the geometry of smotifs is fully sampled (Fernandez-Fuentes
et al., 2010).

Here we extend the use of motifs and we present Frag’r’Us, a
knowledge-based approach designed to sample the conformation
of loop regions between fixed ﬂanking regular secondary struc-
tures. The sampling is based in the comparison of the geometry
between query and candidate smotifs (see Server Usage in sup-
plementary data), is length independent (the ﬁnal loop length is
not predetermined) and is very fast: a search among thousand of
potential conformations is done in a matter of seconds.
Candidate smotifs matching the geometrical constraints can
then be grafted into the protein scaffold to be used as starting
conformations for different de novo design manipulations.

2 APPLICATION

2.1 Deﬁnition of smotifs and geometry features

Smotifs are super secondary elements composed of a loop region ﬂanked
by two regular secondary structures, i.e. or-helix or ,B-strand. The local
structural arrangement of the two ﬂanking secondary structures, i.e. Nt
and Ct, deﬁnes the geometry of the smotif through four internal vari-
ables, a distance D and three angles, i.e. delta, theta and rho, as described
in our earlier work (Fernandez-Fuentes et al., 2006).

2.2 Server usage

The method has been implemented as a step-by-step web server. Frag’r’Us’
basic inputs are the 3D coordinates and secondary structure deﬁnitions. In
both cases, those inputs can be provided by the user (Supplementary
Materials) or the coordinates can be automatically gathered from a
Protein Data Bank (PDB) identiﬁcation code (Berman et al., 2000) and

the secondary structure calculated using DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983).
The chain of interest has to be deﬁned. Additionally, the user can tune the
tolerance for every search parameter exploited by the server. This includes
the source database of smotifs, every geometrical property of the smotifs,
the loop length and the structural ﬁtting. Finally, it can perform three
different tasks, namely, identify smotifs in the query coordinates, search
for geometrically compatible smotifs and structurally align them. The
search of candidate smotifs can be done in two different libraries: a redun-
dant and non-redundant derived from the high-quality protein structures
(i.e. X-ray resolution better than 2.5 A) deposited in the PDB (Berman
et al., 2000) using PISCES (Wang and Dunbrack, 2003) at a 95 and 40%
sequence identity cutoff respectively. See the Supplementary Material for a
detailed explanation on both inputs and outputs.

2.3 Smotifs sampling as strategy to generate useful initial
conformations for backbone remodeling

The sampling of backbone conformations of loop regions is done using
smotifs deﬁnitions. The sampling generates a comprehensive set of realistic
conformations to be used as a starting point for further manipulation and
optimization using protein design techniques. To further demonstrate that
the sampled conformations are suitable, we have compiled a list of cases
where the 3D structures of the scaffold and computationally engineered
proteins are known. The set includes a wide range of examples in de novo
computation design including a Diels-Alderase (Eiben et al., 2012), a
human guanine deaminase (Murphy et al., 2009), the catalytic loops in
(,Bor)8-barrel scaffolds (Claren et al., 2009), two retro-aldol enzymes (Jiang
et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012), a triosephosphate isomerase (Saab-Rincon
et al., 2012) and the motifs to target antibody bl2 (Azoitei et al., 2011). A
detailed analysis of each case can be found in the Supplementary Material.

Of the cases presented above, the remodeling of a 24-residue long
insertion that included a helix-turn-helix motif is perhaps the most chal-
lenging (Eiben et al., 2012). The remodeling of this region was carried by
combining computational structure-based design: Rosetta (Leaver-Fay
et al., 2011), and crowdsourcing using the game-driven protein folding
Foldit (http://fold.it). As shown in Figure l, the loop region of and smotif
extracted from an uncharacterized protein from Porphyromonas gingivalis
W83 (PG_1388; PDB code 2p3p) closely resembles the structure of the
remodeled region.

3 CONCLUSION

In this article, we present a server, Frag’r’Us, designed to sample
loop conformations using the geometrical constrains of smotifs.
Frag’r’Us has clear applications in de novo computational design
by seeding the search of alternative backbone conformations using
geometrically suitable backbone regions extracted from known
protein structures. Frag’r’Us can be also used in proteiniprotein,

proteininucleic acids and protein-small ligand interface design by

Finally, Frag’r’Us can complement loop structure prediction
methods and X-ray/NMR reﬁnement protocols by generating
100p conformations that are length independent.

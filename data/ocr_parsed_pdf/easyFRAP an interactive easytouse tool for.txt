ABSTRACT

Summary: We present easyFRAP, a versatile tool that assists
quantitative and qualitative analysis of fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP) data. The user can handle simultaneously
large data sets of raw data, visualize fluorescence recovery curves,
exclude low quality data, perform data normalization, extract
quantitative parameters, perform batch analysis and save the
resulting data and figures for further use. Our tool is implemented as a
single-screen Graphical User Interface (GUI) and is highly interactive,
as it permits parameterization and visual data quality assessment at
various points during the analysis.

Availability: easyFRAP is free software, available under the
General Public License (GPL). Executable and source files,
supplementary material and sample data sets can be downloaded
at: ccl.med.upatras.gr/easyfrap.html.

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Functional live cell imaging techniques, such as Fluorescence
Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP), exploit the properties of
ﬂuorescent proteins coupled with modern microscopy systems and
are increasingly used to visualize, track and quantify molecules in
living cells. Like all photobleaching methods, FRAP involves the
irreversible bleaching of emitted light from molecules tagged with
a ﬂuorescent protein. During a typical FRAP experiment, a deﬁned
region of interest (R01) is bleached by a short laser pulse and the
ﬂuorescence recovery in the R01 is then monitored by time-lapse
microscopy. Analysis of FRAP data provides information on the
kinetic behavior of the studied molecules, such as diffusion and
macromolecular interactions (Sprague and McNally, 2005).

A typical FRAP data set consists of a number of noisy images
acquired before, during and after photobleaching. These raw
experimental data must be carefully processed to permit biologically
signiﬁcant conclusions to be drawn. FRAP data analysis consists of
multiple steps. Following quantiﬁcation of ﬂuorescence intensity in
the various ROIs, intensity values are processed to remove noise,
systematic bias and artifacts (referred to as normalization), raw

and normalized single-cell curves are visually inspected for quality
assessment and mean values from multiple cells are plotted for
qualitative analysis. Curve ﬁtting and parameter extraction permits
quantitative analysis (Reits and Neefjes, 2001). This process is
usually performed manually using common spreadsheet software
packages and is time-consuming and prone to errors. The need for
automated analysis has led to the development of new software,
such as FrapCalc (http://cmci.embl.de/downloads/frap_analysis),
VirtualFRAP (Cowan, 2009) and FRAPAnalyser (http://actinsim.
uni.lu/eng/Downloads/FRAPAnalyser). However, as functional live
cell imaging becomes wide-spread in biology laboratories, there
is a lack of fast, interactive and easy-to-use tools that do not
require access to commercially licensed software and are not
computationally intensive.

2 PROGRAM OVERVIEW

In this note, we present easyFRAP, a stand-alone application
that facilitates qualitative and quantitative analysis of FRAP data.
EasyFRAP allows the user to handle large data sets of raw data under
various experimental conditions and thus facilitates differential
analysis and comparison. The main functions of easyFRAP include
data visualization, normalization of the raw recovery curves and
curve ﬁtting and are accessible through a single screen GUI
(Fig. 1A). The user can easily exclude low quality data, extract
quantitative information and save the resulting data and ﬁgures
for further analysis. The FRAP analysis workﬂow is organized as
follows (for a full description including quick start guide, manual
and deﬁnitions, see Supplementary Material).

(1) The user selects a dataset for uploading. Input data must
contain intensity measurements from the bleached area
(ROIl), the total ﬂuorescence area (R012) and a background
area (R013) and the corresponding time-points. EasyFRAP
works with .csv, .txt and .xls ﬁle formats.

(2) Raw intensities in R011, R012 and R013 are plotted for visual
examination and data quality assessment.

(3) Using the list box, a number of low quality samples can be
excluded (and restored) from the analysis.

(4) The user is asked to insert the necessary parameters (number
of pre-bleach, bleach and post-bleach images).
Optionally, a number of initial pre-bleach values can be
deleted (and restored), as they exhibit loss of ﬂuorescence

due to non-intentional bleaching. The bleaching depth and
the gap ratio values are then computed (see Supplementary
Material).

(5) The normalized recovery curves are computed and visualized,
according to the commonly used formulas of double (Phair,
2003) or ﬁill scale normalization (Ellenberg, 1997).

(6) The user can select a sample of interest and perform curve
ﬁtting using a single or double term exponential equation. The
thalf (half maximal recovery time) and mobile fraction values
(individual and mean values) are computed. The data, ﬁtted
curve and the residuals are visualized in order to evaluate the
ﬁt and goodness-of—ﬁt statistics (R2) are also provided (see
Supplementary Material).

The top menu allows the user to save all resulting data (raw curves,
normalized curves and curve ﬁtting results) in separate ﬁles at
any point in the analysis for further use. It also includes an extra
feature for FRAP batch analysis (multiple experiment analysis).
These features are incorporated in a simple and intuitive GUI,
allowing the user to analyze a complete data set in just a matter of
minutes.

3 TEST CASE

EasyFRAP was tested using data from FRAP experiments on
CdthFP and on a nuclear localized construct of GFP (GFPnls),
on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Fig. 1B). The thalf and the
mobile fraction values are computed for CdthFP and GFPnls data
(Table 1).

Based on the calculated thalf values, we conclude that CdthFP
exhibits signiﬁcantly slower mobility than GFPnls, but highly
dynamic behavior, consistent with prior analyses (Roukos, 2011;
Xouri, 2007a, b).

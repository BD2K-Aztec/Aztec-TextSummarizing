2 IMPLEMENTATION

The first step of our approach consists in an extension of the BALL
project (Hildebrandt et al., 2010), where common functionality has
been encapsulated in command-line tools. These have then been supple-
mented with a mechanism for the generation of description ﬁles for work-
ﬂow systemsiGalaxy in particulariwhich then allows for the
integration of the tools into a workﬂow. In the process, we also extended
the Galaxy system to support molecular ﬁle formats and automatically
load the BALL tools.

To solve the problem of providing workﬂow functionality in combin-
ation with a versatile modelling environment, we then extended
BALLView (Moll et al., 2005, 2006) by a plugin that tightly integrates
communication with a ballaxy server (local or remote) into the modelling
toolkit. ballaxy is based on the Galaxy workﬁow engine and uses its
powerful user management, tool handling and workﬂow environment.
To this end, we extend Galaxy to understand molecular ﬁle formats
such as PDB or MOL2, and by tools for structural data in the context
of molecular modelling and computer-aided drug design. Automated ﬁle
format detection inside Galaxy uses the python interface of BALL.
Structures can be downloaded, visualized and manipulated in
BALLView and, through an entry in their context menu, directly up-
loaded to the server. A browser window embedded into BALLView is
then used to interact with ballaxy in the usual fashion to create or run
tools and workﬂows. The results of these workﬁows can then be directly
downloaded into the BALLView instance through the click of a button,
where they are displayed in 3D and can be further manipulated or stored.

To provide a collection of useful tools, we further extended the BALL
library. These tools will be integrated into BALL version 1.5, which is in
development at the time of writing. Besides convenience tools like mo-
lecular ﬁle converters or a connected component splitter, we currently
account for four main application areas: NMR shift prediction (Dehof
et al., 2013, 2011a), ligand optimal bond order assignment (Dehof et al.,
2011b), pose clustering (Hildebrandt et al., 2013) and docking
(Kohlbacher, 2012).

Furthermore, various tools for computer-aided drug design provide
functionality to set up ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening
workﬂows. The ligand-based part comprises quantitative structureiactiv-
ity relationship (QSAR) tools for reading and preprocessing of QSAR
datasets, model generation and validation, feature selection and activity
prediction. The structure-based part offers tools to read, check and pre-
pare protein structures and virtual compound libraries, for pocket detec-
tion, receptor grid generation and protein-ligand docking. Tools for
target and antitarget rescoring of initial docking poses allow customized
improvement of the docking outcome. Post-docking analysis tools like a
ScoreAnalyzer or an RMSDCalculator enable the examination of ﬁnal
docking results and their clustering. All the tools support a standard set
of parameters, e.g. for ﬁle input, output and help texts. All the tools also
support different execution environments: the same tool can be used for
standard command line usage as well as for integration into a workﬂow
toolkit. Each tool is additionally able to export its own conﬁguration ﬁle
used to tell the workﬂow package about its existence and mode of
operation.

3 EXAMPLE

Workﬂow systems such as Galaxy offer great beneﬁts for many
ﬁelds of science. Using a system such as ballaxy, these benefits

also apply to applications in structural—based drug discovery. A
typical docking workﬂow using CADDSuite (Kohlbacher, 2012)
tools is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, where it is described
in detail.

Finally, addition of new tools using BALL is simple and is
described in our documentation (http://ball—trac.bioinf.uni—sb.de/
wiki/ballaxy).

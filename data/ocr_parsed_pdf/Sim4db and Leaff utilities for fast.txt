ABSTRACT

Summary: The large number of genomes that will be sequenced
will need to be annotated with genes and other functional features.
Aligning gene sequences from a related species to the target genome
is an economical and highly reliable method to identify genes;
unfortunately, existing tools have been lacking in sensitivity and
speed. A program we reported, sim4cc, was shown to be highly
accurate but is limited to comparing one cDNA with one genomic
sequence. We present here an optimization of the tool, implemented
in the packages sim4db and leaff. The new tool performs batch
alignments of cDNA and genomic sequences in a fraction of the
time required by its predecessor, and thus is very well suited for
genome-wide analyses.

Availability: Sim4db and leaff are written in C, C++ and Perl for
Linux and other Unix platforms. Source code is distributed free of
charge from http://sourceforge.net/projects/kmer/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The number and variety of sequenced genomes will continue
to grow spectacularly. The 10000 Genomes Project (GlOKCOS,
2009) alone will catalog and sequence more than 10000 species
from across the spectrum of verterbate evolution, and there are
numerous ongoing projects to sequence plants and animals of
agricultural importance, or of more specialized scientiﬁc interest
(Plant and Animal Genome Conference; http://www.intl-pag.org/).
As sequencing becomes increasingly accessible, one can expect
many more groups and even individual investigators to sequence
the genome of their studied organism. These genomes will need to
be annotated with genes and other functional features. A key resource
of gene information are the cDNA (mRNA, EST) sequences already
in the databases, which can be readily aligned to a target genome
to produce gene models. To ﬁirther facilitate this comparative
annotation approach, an increasing number of projects are producing
mixed collections of resources from several related species, which
are then used to analyze each of those genomes (The Fagaceae
Genomics Project, http://www.fagaceae.org; The Genome Database
for Rosaceae, http://www.rosaceae.org).

Most spliced alignment tools were designed for comparing highly
similar sequences and perform poorly on cross-species comparisons,
where sequence similarity drops. Few programs have been adapted
for aligning sequences cross-species, most notably BLAT (Kent,
2002) and GMAP (Wu and Watanabe, 2005). These, however,
produce output that is often less accurate than required, more so
as the distance between species increases. Other tools, reviewed
in Zhou et al. (2009), employ probabilistic or exact dynamic
programming methods and are capable of aligning sequences cross-
species, but lack the speed required for whole-genome annotation
and are limited to comparisons between close species. The main
difﬁculty in aligning cross-species is detecting weakly similar
regions, which leads to incomplete gene models and incorrect
exon boundaries. Differences in the gene models of orthologs
caused by evolutionary block insertion and deletion events are
a ﬁirther challenge. We recently developed a program, sim4cc
(Zhou et al., 2009), which produces more accurate alignments
and for a wider range of evolutionary distances than previously
possible. Sim4cc followed the ‘seed-and-extend’ approach of its
predecessor sim4 (Florea et (11., 1998), one of the earliest spliced
alignment tools, but incorporated specialized features, such as
mathematically optimized spaced seeds, sophisticated splice site
models and evolution-sensitive alignment algorithms. Sim4cc’s
basic use is a ‘one-to-one’ alignment of one cDNA with one genomic
region, intended for the analysis of a small number of samples, which
makes it less friendly for pipeline applications.

We developed an optimized framework for running batch
sim4cc tasks, called sim4db, which speeds up processing by
two orders of magnitude for a typical application. The main
improvements are a fast sequence indexing and compression
mechanism, implemented in the package leaf f and medium-
grained multi-threading. Source code and online documentation for
the program are available free of charge and under an open-source
model from http://sourceforge.net/projects/kmer/.

2 APPROACH

Sim4 db takes as input two multifasta ﬁles containing the genomic
and the cDNA sequences, respectively, and optionally a script
specifying a set of pairings among the sequences. For instance, the
script line ‘-e 5 -D 0 14500 60 000 -r’ indicates that the reverse
complement of the sixth sequence in the cDNA ﬁle should be aligned
to the region 14 500—60 000 in the ﬁrst genomic sequence. If no
script is given, the default operation is an all-against-all comparison.
This new streamlined format makes incorporation into an automated
analysis pipeline considerably easier. Sim4 db then determines

a sim4cc alignment for each sequence pair speciﬁed in the
script. The process is multithreaded, with several concurrent threads
handling the reading and writing of sequences and alignments and
the alignment calculation. Sim4 db returns matches that pass user-
deﬁned cutoffs for coverage, percent sequence identity or alignment
length, or the best result for each run. One important feature
of sim4db not available with sim4cc is the ability to detect
multiple cDNA matches in a genomic region, which is essential
when searching for cDNAs from a gene family. For broader utility,
sim4 db can be used to align sequences from either different species
(option ‘-interspecies), using the sim4cc algorithm, or the same
species, using the sim4 algorithm.

A key feature of sim4db is the ability to perform fast random
access to sequences. The leaf f package is used to generate a
random access index into the supplied multifasta ﬁle, which then
allows one or several sequences, or intervals within these sequences,
to be retrieved by index number or keyword. Leaf f is incorporated
into the sim4db code as a library, but can also be used from
the command line. In addition to sequence retrieval, the package
contains utilities for diverse sequence manipulations, including
simulating errors in sequences for testing alignment programs,
partitioning a large sequence into equally sized pieces and generating
random subsets of sequences from a multifasta ﬁle.

3 RESULTS

Sim4db can be used to align a small or a very large number of
pairs of sequences, sequentially (option ‘-pairwise’) or as prescribed
by a script, or to perform an all-against-all comparison. While the
genomic sequences can be chromosomes, a time-saving strategy for
genome-wide applications is to use sim4db to reﬁne alignments
in regions detected by a less accurate but fast high-throughput
mapper, such as GMAP or BLAT. Figure 1 shows a typical user
scenario where 92142 zebraﬁnch GenBank ESTs were aligned
to the recently assembled 1GB turkey genome (Turkey Genome
Sequencing Consortium, 2010). First, sequences were mapped to
the genome using GMAP in cross-species mode (’ —X’ option);
then, s im4db realigned each cDNA to its matching region extended
on both sides by 50KB (Supplementary Material S1). As Figure 1
illustrates, adding sim4 db produces longer alignments, and leads
to more mapped sequences for any coverage cutoff than using GMAP
alone. Overall, sim4db extends GMAP’s alignments by more than
10% on average, a signiﬁcant gain in sensitivity. (A more detailed
analysis of accuracy, and comparison to other tools, is included in
Supplementary Material S2).

We also compared the run time of sim4db versus a standard
pipelined invocation of multiple sim4cc’s. For this purpose,
pairings in the script were sorted by genomic sequence index to
minimize computationally expensive accesses to the genome ﬁle.
Thus, each genomic sequence was read the ﬁrst time its index was
encountered, and then reused on subsequent calls involving that
index. Two tests were performed. In the ﬁrst test, a Perl script
read pairs of sequences directly from the multi-fasta ﬁles, invoking
sim4cc for each pair. In the second test, the leaff utility was

used to retrieve the sequences. Sim4db had a 275-fold speedup
(from 5 h 33 min to l min 12.5 s on a 3.0 GHz quad-core Intel Xeon
processor) over the simple scan, and l45-fold when the leaf f
utility was used. These improvements are truly signiﬁcant, and are
critical for mapping very large datasets efﬁciently.

4 CONCLUSION

We described a utility, sim4db, for performing batch spliced
alignment of cDNA and genomic sequences from the same or
related species. The tool has the high accuracy of its predecessors,
sim4 and sim4cc, but is two orders of magnitude faster, owing
to its multithreaded design and fast sequence indexing. Sim4db
can be invoked from the command line or can be combined with a
fast sequence search engine for automated use. Compact, fast and
accurate, and delivering provenly more accurate alignments than
existing tools, we believe sim4db is a much needed addition to
every genome annotator’s repertoire of tools.

Abstract

Motivation: As concurrent use of multiple medications becomes ubiquitous among patients, it is
crucial to characterize both adverse and synergistic interactions between drugs. Statistical meth—
ods for prediction of putative drug—drug interactions (DDls) can guide in vitro testing and cut down
significant cost and effort. With the abundance of experimental data characterizing drugs and their
associated targets, such methods must effectively fuse multiple sources of information and per—
form inference over the network of drugs.

Results: We propose a probabilistic approach forjointly inferring unknown DDls from a network of
multiple drug—based similarities and known interactions. We use the highly scalable and easily ex—
tensible probabilistic programming framework Probabilistic Soft Logic. We compare against two
methods including a state—of—the—art DDI prediction system across three experiments and show
best performing improvements of more than 50% in AUPR over both baselines. We find five novel
interactions validated by external sources among the top—ranked predictions of our model.
Availability and implementation: Final versions of all datasets and implementations will be made

publicly available.

1 Introduction

Increasingly, patients use multiple pharamceutical drugs simultan—
eously to treat their illnesses. Interactions between drugs can result
in reduced efficacy of one or more drugs, and in some cases, even
deletrious side—effects. The risk of adverse effects is higher in demo—
graphics like the elderly that commonly take multiple medications at
once. On the other hand, certain drugs interact to produce synergis—
tic effects that are more effective in combatting diseases like cancer
(Chou, 2010; Nahta et (11., 2004). Crowther et al. (1997) character—
izes a drug—drug interaction (DDI) as a drug effect that is greater or
less than expected in the presence of another drug. Although it re—
mains crucial to verify potential DDIs in vitro, it is prohibitively ex—
pensive to exhaustively test all possible interactions. Therefore,
computational modeling and predictive methods provide a viable
way to identify the most salient potential interactions for down—
stream experimental validation (Zhang et (11., 2009).

Interactions between drugs are classified as pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic. Computational and mathematical modeling
methods rely on current understanding of the mechanisms underly—
ing each of these types of interactions and are specific to each inter—
action type. A pharmacokinetic interaction with a drug affects the
process by which the other drug is absorbed, distributed, metabo—
lized or excreted in the body (Crowther et (11., 1997). On the other
hand, drugs acting on the same receptor, site of action or physio—
logical system constitute a pharmacodynamic interaction. Although
pharmacokinetic interactions are usually associated with an adverse
or exaggerated response, pharmacodynamic interactions are impli—
cated in both synergistic and detrimental effects. Many pharmacoki—
netic interactions are facilitated by the enzyme family Cytochrome
P450 (CYP) and extensive but incomplete knowledge of its mechan—
isms have been used for computational modeling of pharmacoki—
netic interactions (Ekins and Wrighton, 2001). Similarly, prior work

D. Sridhar et al.

 

has applied mathematical modeling of known drug response mech—
anisms to simulate and predict pharmacodynamic interactions (Jin
et al., 2011; Jonker et al., 2005).

In contrast to computational modeling, statistical and predictive
methods leverage data and evidence from related experiments as do—
main knowledge and biological priors. Recent advancements in high—
throughput experimentation have generated a wealth of biological
characterizations of drug compounds and their target genes (Fakhraei
et al., 2015). A key challenge for statistical models of DDIs, or the
closely related problem of drug—target interactions, lies in fusing or
combining information from multiple data sources. Much related
work has developed ways of computing similarity scores between
drugs or pairs of drugs to be used as features for machine learning
classifiers (Atias and Sharan, 2011; Cheng and Zhao, 2014; Gottlieb
et al., 2012; Vilar et al., 2013, 2014). Sophisticated algorithms such
as restricted Boltzmann machines and matrix factorization are espe—
cially effective in combining two types of similarities by learning la—
tent representations of the entities (Cao et al., 2015; Gonen, 2012;
Wang and Zeng, 2013); however, they do not inherently support mul—
tiple similarities in the same model. Statistical methods for DDI pre—
diction are more generalizable as they do not rely on extensive expert
knowledge of each mode of interaction. Although Park et al. (2015);
Huang et al. (2013) apply their predictive methods only to pharmaco—
dynamic interactions, statisicals models can be easily extended to
both types of interactions. To the best of our knowledge, Gottlieb
et al. (2012) present state—of—the—art results for DDI prediction of both
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with their INDI
system for combining similarity measures to use features for a local 10—
gistic regression classifier.

However, these similarity—based methods neglect the structural
information encoded in the biological network of drugs and their
interactions. Two general types of approaches have been studied for
adding network information to similarity—based features: methods
that compute additional network—based features and methods that
perform inference directly over the structure of the network. We
refer to these as network—similarity methods and network—based in—
ference methods, respectively. Both kinds of approaches begin by
formulating a graph of drugs and their interactions. Network—
similarity methods proceed by computing relational features, based
on the local neighborhoods of drugs such as neighborhood overlap
and other well—studied network attributes (Cao et al., 2015; Cheng
and Zhao, 2014; Huang et al., 2013). The relational features supple—
ment the similarity information given as input to a classifier. In con—
trast, network—based inference methods reason over the graph
structure when predicting interactions.

Multiple network—based inference approaches have been intro—
duced for the closely related problem of drug—target interaction pre—
diction. Bleakley and Yamanishi (2009) formulate the problem of
inferring missing links in a bipartite graph of drugs and targets, and
introduce a model that uses local bipartite structure for prediction.
Cheng et al. (2012); Mei et al. (2013) similarly leverage local bipart—
ite topology for inference and Park et al. (2015) introduce a random
walk approach for reasoning over the network of drugs and targets.
However, local network—based features cannot enforce global con—
straints based on the full graph of entities. Given local relational fea—
tures, current network—based inference methods follow traditional
machine learning algorithms in assuming the instances to be inde—
pendent and identically distributed. In recent work, Fakhraei et al.
(2013, 2014) improve upon existing bipartite drug—target inter—
action prediction approaches using the probabilistic programming
framework Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) to jointly classify all inter—
actions, fusing similarity relations and global network information.

In this work, we formalize the problem of network—based DDI
prediction using multiple similarity relations. We collectively predict
DDIs, considering statistical dependencies between predictions
along with knowledge of observed interactions using PSL. We apply
our collective approach to predict DDIs on three kinds of inter—
actions: (i) CYP—related interactions (CRDs), (ii) NCRDs and (iii)
general interactions documented by Drugbank (Wishart et al.,
2006). For all settings, we evaluate our collective approach against
two non—collective methods including state—of—the—art INDI system
of Gottlieb et al. (2012) and a non—collective PSL model. Our model
achieves statistically significant improvement up to 5% in area
under the ROC (AUC) results from Gottlieb et al. (2012). We fur—
ther assess area under the precision—recall curve (AUPR) for all
methods and show that our collective DDI prediction approach sig—
nificantly outperforms the state—of—the—art baseline method by up to
50%. Finally, we present important novel DDIs predicted by our ap—
proach that are validated in literature.

2 Materials

We use two datasets for our experimental evaluation. The first data—
set, released by Gottlieb et al. (2012), includes pairwise interactions
between 807 drugs, with the drug IDs anonymized. We constructed
the second dataset by extracting interactions from Drugbank for the
315 drugs used by Fakhraei et al. (2014); Perlman et al. (2011),
where Drugbank IDs are provided for additional validation. The fol—
lowing section described interaction types and similarities used in
these datasets.

2.1 Drug interaction data

For the first dataset, Gottlieb et al. (2012) download 10,702 inter—
actions from DrugBank and 70,099 interactions listed as moderate
or high from Drugs.com website(Wishart et al., 2006). The dataset
contains two types of interactions: (i) CRDs, where both drugs are
metabolized by the same CYP enzyme (ii) NCRDs, where no CYP is
shared between the drugs (NCRDs). After filtering and processing,
the final dataset includes 10 106 CRD and 45 737 NCRD DDIs
(Gottlieb et al., 2012) across 807 drugs.

For the second dataset, we download interactions from
DrugBank version 4.3 for the 315 drugs used by Fakhraei et al.
(2014) and Perlman et al. (2011). We cross referenced Drugbank
IDs released for the 315 drugs to extract the listed drug interactions,
resulting in 4293 known interactions.

2.2 Drug similarity data
Both datasets contain seven drug—drug similarities. Four of these
similarity measures are drug—based: Chemical—based, Ligand—based,
Side—effect—based and Annotation—based. Three similarities are be—
tween drug targets and computed by aggregating over known targets
for the drugs: Sequence—based, PPI network—based, and Gene
Ontology—based. In the first dataset, Gottlieb et al. (2012) average
maximal similarities between the associated targets for drugs that
have more than one target. In the second dataset, we average over
all possible pairwise similarities between target genes for drugs that
have multiple targets.

The following section provides a brief description of the methods in
Gottlieb et al. (2012) and Perlman et al. (2011) for similarity extraction:

2.2.1 Chemical-based
is the Jaccard similarity, or closely related Dice similarity, of mo—
lecular fingerprints from pairs of drugs. Molecular fingerprints are

retrieved from cheminformatics toolkits such as chemical develop—
ment kit (CDK) (Steinbeck et al., 2006) or RDKit using canonical
SMILES (simplified molecular input line entry specification).
Fingerprinting methods represent molecules as bit strings for fast
similarity computation and are grouped into hashing—based and
structural methods. Hashed fingerprints such as the Daylight
method rely on hash functions to represent linear substructures of
molecules as bit strings. Structural fingerprints such as MACCS,
Atom—Pair, Morgan and Feature—Based Morgan methods use
features of molecular substructures to compute bit strings. The
Jaccard and Dice similarity scores between two sets X and Y are
defined as

_— D X Y *

Jaccard(X, Y) — M

We obtain all fingerprints described above from RDKit and add—
itionally, the hashed fingerprint from CDK computed with default
values as used by Gottlieb et al. (2012). In our experiments, we use
the hashed fingerprint from CDK after comparing performance of
all fingerprinting methods on development data.

2.2.2 Ligand based

Ligan based is the Jaccard similarity between the corresponding sets
of protein—receptor families for each drug pair. The protein—receptor
is obtained from the similarity ensemble approach search tool
(Keiser et al., 2009) Drugs’ canonical SMILES compared with a col—
lection of ligands (A substance that binds with a biomolecule to
serve a biological purpose.).

2.2.3 Side-effect based
Side—effect based is the Jaccard similarity score between common
side—effects for each pair of drugs.

2.2.4 Annotation based
Annotation based is the Resnik semantic similarity (Resnik et al.,
1999) of Drugs’ Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes
mapped to the World Health Organization ATC classification sys—
tem (Skrbo et al., 2003).

2.2.5 Sequence based

Sequence based is the Smith—Waterman sequence alignment score
between the corresponding drug targets (proteins). They are normal—
ized via dividing the pairwise score by the geometric mean of the
alignment scores of each sequence against itself, suggested in
Bleakley and Yamanishi (2009).

2.2.6 Protein—protein interaction network-based

Protein—protein interaction network—based is the distance between
pairs of corresponding drug targets using their corresponding pro—
teins in the human protein—protein interactions network via an all—
pairs shortest path algorithm.

2.2.7 Gene ontology based
Gene ontology based is the Resnik semantic similarity (Resnik et al.,
1999) between Gene Ontology annotations of drugs’ corresponding
targets.

For more detailed descriptions of these similarities, refer to
Gottlieb et al. (2012) and Perlman et al. (2011).

3 Methods
3.1 The problem of DDI prediction

We consider the problem of inferring new edges in a partially
observed graph of interactions between drug vertices by leveraging
multiple known similarity relations between vertices. We are given a
set of drugs D : {D1 . . . Du}. We observe a set of interaction edges
between the drugs denoted by n X 7; interaction matrix I where
I,-,-: 1 indicates an interaction between d,- and d,- and is 0 indicates an
unobserved or missing edge. Additionally we are given a set of n X
n drug—drug similarity relations encoded by tables {M1 . . .Mk}
where M1,], 6 [0, 1] and indicates similarity between d,- and d,- accord—
ing to biological similarity I.

We define a drug network as a multigraph G : (V, E) where
V: D is the vertex set of drugs and E : {M1 . . .Mk} U I is the col—
lection of multiple edge types given by the similarity relations and
the interaction matrix I. The DDI prediction problem is to use all
the information encoded in G to predict the unobserved interaction
edges between drug vertices in G.

3.2 Collective probabilistic reasoning for network—based
inference of interactions

Given all the information G, we want to infer interaction values for
missing edges U : {(di, di))I,-,- : 0}. Many techniques have been
studied for inference of missing links but here we focus on the inter—
section of two well known approaches: network—based methods and
collective probabilistic methods. Generally, network—based inference
techniques make use of the structure of G by considering the local
neighborhoods for each d,- and d,- in edges we want to infer. For ex—
ample, network—based methods might include set similarity of the
neighbors of d,- and d,- along with the local edge similarities encoded
in G. Collective probabilistic methods learn joint distributions P(U,
G) to infer the most probable joint assignment to all edges in U
thereby leveraging statistical dependencies between prediction tar—
gets as well as the observations in G. Network—based collective
methods combine the two techniques by parametrizing P(U, G) ac—
cording to structural features of G. Collective prediction methods
have been shown to work well in the closely related setting of drug—
target interaction prediction (Fakhraei et al., 2014). Below we de—
scribe hinge—loss Markov random fields (MRFs) and PSL, a frame—
work for performing network based collective inference, and
describe our model for DDI prediction.

3.2.1 Hinge-loss MRFs and PSL
Our model for collective DDI prediction uses a special class of
MRF. In this section, we review the foundations of our model and
describe its use in interaction prediction between drugs.

PSL uses declarative, first order logic—like syntax to template for
a special class of MRF model known as hinge—loss MRFs (HL—
MRFs). HL—MRFs admit efficient, scalable and exact maximum a
posteriori (MAP) inference (Bach et al., 2015). These models are
defined over continuous random variables, which provide a natural
interpretation for real—valued similarities. MAP inference in HL—
MRFs is a convex optimization problem over these variables.
Formally, a hinge—loss MRF defines a joint probability density func—
tion of the form

1 M
P(YlX) : ECXP(—Zr:14r¢r(Y7X)>a (1)
where the entries of target variables Y and observed variables X are
in [0,1], A is a vector of weight parameters, Z is a normalization
constant, and

9103 ‘Og isnﬁnv 110 sajaﬁuv soc] ‘BtHJOJtIBQ 30 AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'sleu1n0lp103x0"sotJBuiJOJutotq/ﬁduq 11101} papeolumoq

D. Sridhar et al.

 

¢r(Y7X) = (maX{lr(Y7X)70})p' (2)

is a hinge-loss potential specified by a linear function I, and optional
exponent p, E {1, 2}. Given a collection of logical implications
based on domain knowledge described in PSL and a set of observa—
tions from data, the rules are instantiated, or grounded out, with
known entities in the dataset. Each instantiation of the rules maps to
a hinge—loss potential function as in Equation (2), and the potential
functions define an HL—MRF model.

To illustrate modeling in PSL, we consider a prototypical similar—
ity based rule that encourages transitive closure for link prediction
between entities a, b, c:

Similar(a, b) /\ Link(b, c) —> Link(a, c)

where link represents the continuous target variable for a link predic—
tion task and similar is a continuous observed variable. The convex
relaxation of this logical implication for continuous truth values is

max(similar(a, b) + link(b, c) — link(a,c) — 1,0)

and can be understood as its distance to satisfaction.

MAP inference minimizes the weighted, convex distances to sat—
isfaction to find an consistent joint assignment for all the target vari—
ables. Higher rule weights induce higher penalties for violating the
rule increasing its relative importance to other rules. Weights are
learned from data through maximum likelihood estimation using
training data and the structured perceptron algorithm. Exact MAP
inference is performed on the learned model to find the most likely
assignments for variables using the consensus based ADMM algo—
rithm. PSL supports latent variable modeling with additional EM—
based learning algorithms. For a full description of PSL, see Bach
et al. (2015). Thus, PSL rules encode the domain knowledge that
leads to a consistent assignment to all target variables. HL—MRFs
have achieved state—of—the—art performance in many domains includ—
ing the collective drug—target interaction prediction task (Fakhraei
et al., 2014). The open source PSL software can be downloaded
from the website (http://psl.umiacs.umd.edu/).

3.2.2 Collective DDI prediction PSL model

The rules of a PSL model capture beliefs or knowledge about the
problem domain. For the DDI domain encoded by drug network G,
we assert that a drug is likely to be involved in an interaction if it is
similar to another drug that is a known interactor. To model the no—
tion of similarity, we are interested in fusing multiple sources of
drug similarity. We make this concrete in the full set of rules for
DDI prediction shown in Figure 1. where we have one rule for each
drug similarity described in Section 2, resulting in seven rules. We
represent the prediction target with the Interacts(D1, D3) predicate.
Given a set of drugs d1, d2, and d3 with known interaction between
d2 and d3, the rule results in groundings shown in Figure 3.

We exclude multiple symmetric groundings for ease of expos—
ition. The ground rules illustrate the propagation of similarity infor—
mation between target variables as the prediction of
Interacts(d1,d3) informs the assignment of Interact(d2, d1).
Following Fakhraei et al. (2014), we refer to these as ‘triad rules’ as

they encourage triangle completion, or triadic closure. Figure 2
shows a schematic overview of the triad rules. The predicted inter—
action edge provides evidence for other inferences, resulting in a
ﬂow of information throughout the network. This form of collective
prediction leverages the full structure of the drug network graph G
while combining multiple sources of similarity information. To fully
evaluate the impact of joint prediction, we describe below two base—
line methods that work non—collectively and assume independence
between predicted interactions.

3.3 Comparison methods
We compare against two non—collective methods including the state—

of—the—art INDI framework for inferring interactions between drugs
(Gottlieb et al., 2012). We describe each of these below.

3.3. 1 State-of—the-art INDI method

Gottlieb et al. (2012) introduce the INDI framework for novel DDI
prediction. They introduce a method for computing similarity scores
between target interaction edges to known interaction edges based
on the given drug—drug similarities. For each target drug—pair, each
pairwise combination of similarities is considered for computing the
similarity score to the most similar known drug interaction. The
procedure effectively performs nearest neighbor search using differ—
ent similarity distance measures. Each score is then used as a feature
to train a logistic regression classifier. We refer to Gottlieb et al.
(2012) for full details.

3.3.2 Non-collective PSL model

To quantify the effect of collective prediction, we also use a non—
collective PSL model that considers the dependencies between the
target interactions and observed interactions only, as in the INDI
method. Formally, we modify the triad rules above as shown below
in Figure 4. where we introduce the InteractsobS predicate to limit
the triadic closure of predicted interactions to known interactions
only.

Probalistic approach for collective DDI prediction

 

3.4 Experimental protocol

In order to validate our collective DDI prediction method and compare
against state—of—the—art methods, we perform experiments on the two
drug interaction networks described in Section 3. For each dataset, we
perform 10—fold cross—validation across all pairs of interactions. We
use 8—folds as interaction evidence or observations, 1—fold as training
labels to learn weights for the rules, and the final fold as a held—out test
set. All similarities between drugs are used as evidence, or features, for
the models. The similarity distributions are highly left—skewed, which
is problematic for the soft truth interpretation used by PSL, as values
below 0.5 do not highly affect the inference. We transform all similari—
tity values between drugs by taking the cube—root to normalize the dis—
tributions and allow for proper interpretation by PSL.

We compute AUPR for the positive class, AUC and F1 score on
the test set. Link prediction tasks usually suffer from class imbalance
as true positive links are sparse compared with true negatives.
Related work on general link prediction and DDI prediction report
AUC because it is more robust to the skewness than metrics such as
accuracy. However, AUC is still sensitive to the high number of
negative examples. For practical downstream biological validation
of predicted DDIs, it is more important to have a reliable ranking of
candidate positive interactions. The precision—recall curve better
captures the effectiveness of models at discriminating true positive
examples. F1 score is another measure of classification accuracy and
can interpreted as a weighted average of precision and recall. Since
PSL outputs real—valued truth scores and logistic regression produces
class probabilities, we threshold the values to {0,1} to compute the
F1 score. We perform grid search over a range of threshold values
between [0,1] to obtain best—performing thresholds.

We implement the INDI feature computation method in Matlab
by extending a related implementation of the computation for the
drug—target interaction prediction setting (Fakhraei et al., 2014;
Perlman et al., 2011). We use the logistic regression classifier pro—
vided in the glmfit package with default settings. For our models, we
use the open—source PSL framework. We run 700 iterations of the
structured voted—perceptron weight learning algorithm in PSL and
use default settings for the ADMM inference algorithm. We will
make all code and datasets publicly available.

3.4.1 Blocking methods for PSL

In a drug network with n drugs and n2 interactions where PSL con—
siders dependencies between pairs of interactions, the computational
complexity reaches O(n4), which quickly becomes expensive for large
networks. To make the approach scalable, we employ a common
techniques to block unimportant links from being grounded out by
the model. In the PSL triad rule setting, for each similarity i, we limit
the possible Similar,(D1, D2) edges that are considered for each drug
D1. By blocking on the similarity links, we restrict the grounding of
all possible triads to only the ones that are most likely.

To block similarities in the grounded out PSL models, for each
drug, we perform nearest neighbor search to pick the top 15 most
similar other drugs as evidence for Sim,(D1,D2). In the first drug
dataset, for the CRD interaction experiments, we use a more re—
strictive blocking method to induce more sparsity since CRD
interactions are rarer. When searching for the 15 nearest neigh—
bors for each drug, we restrict ourselves to those drugs that have
appeared in at least one observed interaction in the full network.
In this sparser setting, some drugs may not appear in any Sim,-(D1,
D2) groundings. For those drugs, we additionally retrieve five
most similar other drugs using standard nearest neighbor search
and include the pairs as evidence for Sim,(D1,D2). Fakhraei et al.

(2014) provide more comprehensive analysis on techniques for
blocking.

4 Results

4.1 Comparison to state—of—the—art baselines

We compare our proposed collective PSL approach for DDI predic—
tion to two baselines including the state—of—the—art INDI system with
10—fold cross—validation experiments. We apply the three methods
to each fold and report average and standard deviations of our
chosen metrics for each model. We refer to the INDI system as
INDI, the non—collective PSL baseline as NC—PSL, and collective PSL
model as PSL. Tables 1—3 present average and standard deviation
for AUPR and AUC from cross—validation experiments on the three
interaction types from two datasets: (i) CRDs from Drugs.com and
Drugbank (Gottlieb et al., 2012) (ii) NCRD from Drugs.com and
Drugbank (Gottlieb et al., 2012) (iii) General interactions from
DrugBank. Bolded results highlight statistically significant improve—
ment over both baselines with 06 : 0.05. Figures 5—7 show precision—
recall curves of all methods plotted for interaction type settings
(i—iii) respectively. Additionally, to assess the benefit of fusing mul—
tiple similarities, we compare against our collective PSL model im—
plemented with single similarities. Table 4 shows AUPR for the
collective PSL model for single similarities across interaction type
settings (i—iii).

Gottlieb et al. (2012) report AUC results consistent with our
evaluation of the INDI system as given in Tables 1 and 2. Our col—
lective PSL model statistically significantly outperforms both base—
lines in AUC, AUPR and F1—score for all three interaction type
prediction experiments. For AUPR, in the best case CRD inter—
actions setting, our collective model improves up to 50% in AUPR
over the state—of—the—art INDI system and non—collective PSL model,

state—of—the—art INDI method, with AUC as high as 0.97 for the
NCRD interaction setting, significantly improving over the 0.95
achieved by the INDI system. For F1—score, our collective model im—
proves close to 5 0% over the INDI and non—collective baselines for
the CRD setting and up to 30% for NCRD and general interaction
settings. Interestingly, the non—collective PSL method performs at
least as well as the INDI system in setting (i) and for settings (ii) and
(iii), significantly outperforms the INDI system in AUPR and AUC.
This improvement by the non—collective PSL model demonstrates
the method’s effectiveness in combining multiple similarities as well
as or better than the state—of—the—art similarity combination tech—
nique used by INDI. The gains achieved by the fully collective PSL
model highlights the benefits of joint inference over the full DDI net—
work. Additionally, for all interaction settings, the multiple similar—
ity collective approach significantly improves in AUPR over all
individual similarity collective models. This result supports the find—
ings of Fakhraei et al. (2014) and Gottlieb et al. (2012) that multiple
similarities benefit performance of both drug—target and DDI pre—
diction tasks.

4.2 Validation of unseen interaction predictions

In order for statistical methods to be useful for domain experts, pre—
dictive models should produce highly probable novel interactions
for subsequent in vitro testing. Thus, following Bleakley and
Yamanishi (2009), Fakhraei et al. (2014) and Gottlieb et al. (2012),
we compare top—ranked, unseen DDI predictions produced by our
collective PSL model with evidence from medical and biological
data sources. These predictions are novel with respect to Drugbank
interactions used as training data and validate the ability of our col—
lective approach to produce salient interaction predictions given
observations.

For this experiment, we use predicted DDIs from non—
anonymized dataset 2 to cross—reference in literature. From our 10—
fold cross validation experiments, we output the predictions and fil—
ter out those that are not present in Drugbank as verified inter—
actions. We rank these new predictions and consider the top 10
interactions as shown in Table 5. Bolded rows indicate drug pairs
that are verified by literature or another database as interactors, or
have substantive supporting evidence for potential interaction. We
use the Interactions Checker tool provided by drugs.com (http://
drugs.com) for validation, as these interactions were not used to
train any of our models. Additionally, Drugbank provides the
BioInteractor tool that uses drug—target, —enzyme and —transporter
associations to predict highly probable interactions that are not
included in the main database. Our collective PSL approach highly
ranks five interactions that are substantiated by Interactions

Probalistic approach for collective DDI prediction

 

Checker or BioInteractor. Some interactions involve the following
four drugs that are no longer FDA approved or used outside of the
United States: Suprofen, Acenocoumarol (used worldwide but not in
USA), Practolol and Acetohexamide. Because these drugs are pres—
ently less well—studied and documented, they arise naturally as test
cases for our validation study.

The top predicted interaction is between Suprofen, a non—steroidal
anti—inﬂammatory drug, and Acenocoumarol, an anticoagulant.
BioInteractor characterizes the effect of Suprofen on Acenocoumarol
as a CYP—mediated pharmacokinetic interaction. The sixth most
highly ranked prediction involving Suprofen and Probenecid, a urico—
suric agent used to treat gout, is also classified by BioInteractor as a
CRD. Acetohexamide is in the sulfonylurea class of compounds used
to treat type—II diabetes and is predicted by our model to interact with
Probenecid, which is highly protein—bound. Interactions Checker char—
acterizes this particular interaction as enhancing the hypoglycemic ef—
fects of sulfonyureas when taken together. The risk of using
Probenecid together with Acetohexamide is high with the elderly,
who are commonly treated simultaneously for gout and diabetes.

The collective PSL model also ranks Decitabine, used to treat
Leukemia, and Leﬂunomide, used for rheumatoid arthritis treat—
ment, as interactors. Interactions Checker indicates a major inter—
action between Leﬂunomide and Decitabine in conjunction since
both are immunosuppressants and can have additive effects to in—
crease risk of serious infection. Ranked third, Pentoxifyline, a vaso—
dilator and anti—inﬂammatory used to improve blood circulation, is
predicted to interact with Practolol, a beta—blocked formerly used to
treat cardiac arrhythmias. Although Drugs.com does not list this
particular interaction, the Interactions Checker lists moderate inter—
action between Propranolol, beta—blocker now used in place of
Practolol, and Pentoxifyline. The prediction of an effect on
Pentoxifyline by a drug chemically similar to Propranolol also dem—
onstrates the effectiveness of the PSL triad rules. The propagation of
likely interaction across drugs that are similar is also evident in the
second ranked prediction of interaction between Glipizide and
Tolazamide. Both are sulonyureas like Acetohexamide and are used
to treat type—II diabetes. Though the drugs deliver similar responses,
currently there is no strong evidence of their interaction.

We compare the predictions in Table 5 to the top ten novel inter—
actions predicted by the INDI system. In contrast, only three out of
the ten predictions made by INDI can be verified by BioInteractor or
Interactions Checker: (i) Ciproﬂoxacin and Lomeﬂoxacin (rank 2)
(ii) Methotrexate and Lomeﬂoxacin (rank 4) (iii) Mifepristone and
Lomeﬂoxacin (rank 6). There are no overlaps with the predictions
ranked highly by PSL. Lomeﬂoxacin and Ciproﬂoxacin both fight
infection, Methotrexate treats cancers and Mifepristone ends pre—
gancy. Interestingly, both the collective PSL model and the INDI sys—
tem predict interactions involving major cancer drugs, Decitabine
and Methotrexate, respectively.

5 Discussion

In this work, we formulate the problem of collective DDI prediction.
We introduce a joint probabilistic approach using the PSL frame—
work to fuse multiple sources of similarity information together
with domain—knowledge of the network structure for this domain.
The originality of this work lies in proposing and experimentally
validating a highly scalable, collective probabilistic approach for
DDI prediction that is easily extensible with different sources of in—
formation and similarity measures. We evaluate our approach on
two datasets containing three types of interactions, including one ex—
tracted for this work with known Drugbank IDs for additional

validations. We perform 10—fold cross—validation on all settings and
see that our collective PSL model significantly outperforms two
other similarity—based methods, including the state—of—the—art INDI
system, on two important metrics for link prediction, AUPR and
AUC. Our best performing PSL model improves more than 50%
upon AUPR of both baselines and achieves a best AUC of 0.97.
Moreover, the non—collective similarity—based method implemented
in PSL also significantly outperforms INDI in two settings and per—
forms comparably to INDI in other settings. This result also high—
lights the effectiveness of PSL as an extensible framework for
similarity—based reasoning that enjoys the benefits of collective infer—
ence shown by the first result. Furthermore, the top then predictions
of our best performing collective PSL methods contain five inter—
actions that are unseen in Drugbank but substantiated by
Drugs.com and the BioInteractor tool on Drugbank. This result sig—
nifies the usefulness of our collective approach for producing high—
quality predictions that can be verified experimentally downstream.
Another benefit of our collective PSL method is scalability and
speed. The focus of the INDI method is combining similarities by
computing interaction edge—based similarity score using a nearest—
neighbor search approach. This feature computation is a computa—
tionally expensive procedure, requiring O(n4) passes over the drug
entities. For a dataset containing 807 drugs, this computation takes
~12h on average per fold on a single 32GB machine with 4 cores.
The comparable non—collective PSL model introduced in this work
takes ~1 h for a round of weight learning and inference per fold on
the same machine. The collective PSL model completes computation
for a fold in ~7 h. The PSL framework admits highly efficient,
polynomial—time inference and here, we further reduce computa—
tional complexity by blocking unnecessary groundings of the model.
Scalability is crucial for link prediction tasks in increasingly massive
biological networks, as new drugs are frequently introduced.

The task of DDI prediction is closely related to problems of pre—
dicting drug side effects, drug adverse reactions, and synergistic drug
pairs. Our collective approach for similarity—based reasoning in net—
works can be applied and generalized to all these related settings.

Abstract

Motivation: Timely surveillance of the antigenic dynamics of the influenza virus is critical for accur—
ate selection of vaccine strains, which is important for effective prevention of viral spread and
infection.

Results: Here, we provide a computational platform, called PREDAC—H3, for antigenic surveillance
of human influenza A(H3N2) virus based on the sequence of surface protein hemagglutinin (HA).
PREDAC—H3 not only determines the antigenic variants and antigenic cluster (grouped for similar
antigenicity) to which the virus belongs, based on HA sequences, but also allows visualization of
the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of antigenic clusters of viruses isolated from around
the world, thus assisting in antigenic surveillance of human influenza A(H3N2) virus.

1 Introduction

The seasonal inﬂuenza viruses, i.e. the inﬂuenza A(H1N1),
A(H3N2) and B virus, causes continual epidemics to human society
due to their frequent antigenic drift (Smith et (11., 2004;
Taubenberger and Kash, 2010). Timely surveillance of the antigenic
dynamics of inﬂuenza viruses is critical for selection of appropriate
vaccine strains. The World Health Organization (WHO) established
a Global Inﬂuenza Surveillance Network, which is composed of

National Inﬂuenza Centers from all over the world, to monitor the
spread and antigenic variation of inﬂuenza viruses (WHO, 2014).
Despite these global efforts, vaccine mismatches occasionally hap—
pen (Du et (11., 2012; Salzberg, 2008).

Given the feasibility of rapid and high—quality sequence deter—
mination, a number of sequence—based computational approaches
have been developed to understand the antigenic properties and

characteristics of inﬂuenza virus evolution (Du et al., 2012; Lee and
Chen, 2004; Luksza and Lassig, 2014; Peng et al., 2014).
Previously, we developed a computational method PREDAC to infer
antigenic clusters for human inﬂuenza A(H3N2) virus based on pro—
tein sequences of the immunodominant part of HA (HA1) (Du et al.,
2012). By accurate capture of the antigenic characteristics of the
virus, PREDAC proved helpful to improve the accuracy of vaccine
recommendation in mainland China. Here, we made it easy to use
for the public and further built a user—friendly platform PREDAC—
H3 for antigenic surveillance of human inﬂuenza A(H3N2) virus.
This could assist in timely and accurate selection of vaccine strains.

2 The PREDAC-H3 web server

PREDAC—H3 has functionalities including determining the antigenic
variant and antigenic cluster based on HA1 protein sequence, and
displaying the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of anti—
genic clusters in globe for human inﬂuenza A(H3N2) virus (Fig. 1).
The functionalities of antigenic variant determination and antigenic
cluster inference both take the HA1 protein sequences of the virus as
inputs. The former predicts whether the viruses inputted are of simi—
lar or different antigenicity to previously recommended vaccine
strains (Fig. 1A). An antigenic correlation network (ACnet) visual—
ized using the ﬂash version of Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) is
also provided, which neatly illustrates the antigenic relationships be—
tween the represented viruses (Fig. 1A). The latter infers the anti—
genic clusters to which the viruses inputted belong. A pie chart
would be shown which display the composition of antigenic clusters
for the viruses inputted (Fig. 1B).

The functionalities of displaying the spatial distribution and tem—
poral dynamics of antigenic clusters for human inﬂuenza A(H3N2)
virus rely on the determination of antigenic clusters for all the
human inﬂuenza A(H3N2) viruses with HA1 protein sequence
available in the database of Inﬂuenza Virus Resource (Bao et al.,
2008), which would be conducted by PREDAC. The predicted anti—
genic clusters to which these viruses belong, and other (meta)data of
the entries, including their time and country of isolation, accession
number and strain name, are stored in a database within the plat—
form (Fig. 1C). Users can search the database for the antigenic clus—
ter to which their virus of interest belongs. In order to remain up—to—
date and ensure that influenza A(H3N2) sequences recently submit—
ted to the Inﬂuenza Virus Resource are included, the database is
automatically updated on a monthly basis.

Based on the database, the platform can project the antigenic
clusters circulating in the world for a selected month on a map
(Fig. 1D). This is achieved by coloring the country or region in the
represented map according to the dominant antigenic cluster (with
the largest ratio) circulating in that region in a given month. When
no virus sequences are available in the database in the given month,
the location is presented in gray. Moreover, the temporal antigenic
dynamics in a country or region is graphically represented as a fur—
ther function of PREDAC—H3 (Fig. 1E). Each line in the chart repre—
sents the dynamic change of the ratio of an antigenic cluster
circulating in a country or region over time. The coloring is per—
formed by antigenic cluster, similar to the colors used to represent
spatial dominance of antigenic clusters. Users can select the country

ABSTRACT

Summary: Cytoscape is a popular bioinformatics package for
biological network visualization and data integration. Version 2.8
introduces two powerful new features—Custom Node Graphics and
Attribute Equations—which can be used jointly to greatly enhance
Cytoscape’s data integration and visualization capabilities. Custom
Node Graphics allow an image to be projected onto a node, including
images generated dynamically or at remote locations. Attribute
Equations provide Cytoscape with spreadsheet-like functionality in
which the value of an attribute is computed dynamically as a function
of other attributes and network properties.

Availability and implementation: Cytoscape is a desktop Java
application released under the Library Gnu Public License (LGPL).
Binary install bundles and source code for Cytoscape 2.8 are
available for download from http://cytoscapeorg.

1 INTRODUCTION

Networks are pervasive in biology. Vast datasets are being gathered
to delineate networks of various types and levels, including
networks of genetic and protein—protein interaction networks of
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, social networks
and multiscale networks that span several of these domains (Fowler
et (11., 2009; Tan et al., 2007). These network data extend and
compliment a great deal of other information available in the
biomedical sciences. Although various datasets can appear quite
different in quality and quantity, they all are reﬂections of the
same underlying biological system and its responses. Thus data
integration, along with integrated visualization, is a key.

Cytoscape, now in its eighth year of development, has become a
standard tool for integrated analysis and visualization of biological
networks (Cline et al., 2007; Shannon et al., 2003). Its central
organizing principle is a network graph, with biological entities
(e.g. genes, proteins, cells, patients) represented as nodes and
biological interactions represented as edges between nodes. Data
are integrated with the network using attributes, which map nodes
or edges to speciﬁc data values such as gene expression levels or
protein functions. Attribute values can be used to control visual
aspects of nodes and edges (e.g. shape, color, size) as well as to
perform complex network searches, ﬁltering operations and other
analysis.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Version 2.8 of Cytoscape has introduced two signiﬁcant new
features that improve its ability to integrate and visualize complex
datasets. The ﬁrst feature allows non-programmers to map graphical
images onto nodes, which greatly increases the power and
ﬂexibility with which integrated data can be visualized. The
second feature is the introduction of spreadsheet-like equations into
Cytoscape’s Attribute Browser to enable advanced transformation
and combination of datasets directly within Cytoscape. Separately,
each of these features provides useﬁil new capabilities to Cytoscape.
Taken together, however, these features provide a mechanism for
expressing relationships between sets of data while simultaneously
visualizing the integrated results.

2 INTEGRATED VISUALIZATION

2.1 Custom node graphics

A key ﬁinction of Cytoscape is to allow diverse types of attribute
data to be visualized on the nodes and edges of a biological network.
Scalar data can be linked to simple visualization properties such as
node color, shape or size as node and edge attributes. To represent
multivariate data associated with a node, Cytoscape can control the
visualization of each node using a custom graphical image (since
version 2.3) through a programming API. Version 2.8 introduces
the ability for non-programmers to specify images through the
Cytoscape GUI and to map these images to nodes using Cytoscape’s
standard VizMapper interface.

Using this new feature, images are loaded using a standard ﬁle
browser or by dragging and dropping them into a pool of available
images maintained by Cytoscape. For cases involving large numbers
of custom images, Cytoscape also allows images to be loaded as
node attributes by providing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
address for each image. Given a URL, Cytoscape will try to read
that URL and generate an image for display.

Images can be mapped to nodes using Cytoscape’s VizMapper
framework, which connects the visualization properties of the
network to attribute data. Placement and sizing of images can also
be directly controlled within Cytoscape.

In addition to rich, multivariate visualizations (Fig. 1A and B),
images enable shading, highlights and other aesthetic effects to be
applied to nodes (Fig. 1C) to ﬁirther enhance network visualization.

2.2 Equations

The Cytoscape Attribute Browser provides a tabular View of data
that have been loaded into Cytoscape and attached to nodes, edges or
networks. To improve the ability of users to manipulate attribute data

within Cytoscape, we have added Attribute Equations to version 2.8.
Attribute Equations extend the existing spreadsheet-like behavior
of the Cytoscape Attribute Browser (rows and columns of editable
cells) by allowing users to write equations to populate attribute
values, much like the functions and formulas offered by spreadsheet
software such as Microsoft Excel or Open Ofﬁce.

Attribute Equations simplify data analysis, by permitting direct
manipulation of data, and allow for very complex analysis given
the wide variety of functions provided. Example ﬁinctions include
conditionals (IF), list manipulation (FIRST) and mathematical
transformations (SIN, LOG). We also provide support for basic
mathematical operators such as plus (+), minus (—), multiply (*),
divide U) and exponent (A) along with the string concatenation
operator (&).

For navigation of the built-in functions (66 total), the Cytoscape
Attribute Browser provides a Formula Builder, which displays
a list of available functions with usage descriptions and guides
the user in the construction of valid formulas. Attribute formulas
may reference other attributes, constant values or other functions.
A public programming API is available that allows programmers to
write custom functions and to integrate them alongside the native
ﬁinctions provided by Cytoscape.

2.3 Two illustrative examples: integration of custom
graphics with equations

As a ﬁrst example illustrating the joint use of Custom Node Graphics
and Equations, we integrate networks of protein interactions with
corresponding visualizations of the known protein structures. This
can be accomplished in Cytoscape v2.8 by constructing a URL that
points to an image of the 3D structure of a protein and then mapping
that image to a node in the network. We begin by creating a data

attribute called ‘pdeD’ and, for each node, we populate the value
of this attribute with a valid protein name in the Protein Data Bank
(http://www.pdb.org). We then create a new string attribute, which
we name ‘imageURL’. We then write the following equation for the
imageURL attribute:

: "http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/images/" &
$pdeD & "_bio_500.jpg?bioNum=l"

This equation is copied to all nodes via an option in the right-click
menu of the Attribute Browser. For each node, Cytoscape interprets
the $pdeD variable using the corresponding pdeD attribute value
and concatenates the resulting strings into a valid URL. We then
use the Cytoscape VizMapper to map the imageURL attribute to a
Custom Graphics visual property. As described in Section 2.1, this
visual property interprets the URL and loads the image it points to.
Following this procedure produces rich network visualizations such
as those seen in Figure 1D and E.

A second example that demonstrates the use of both
new features is the GLINECHART ﬁinction available from
the GoogleChartFunctions plugin (available in the Plugin
Manager). This ﬁinction uses the Google Visualization API
(http://code.google.com/apis/visualization) to dynamically generate
a URL to an image. For instance, if a user has time course data
(values {1.1, 2.3, 1.7, 0.6}) for an experiment stored in an attribute
named ‘timeCourse’, the following function call will produce a URL
of a line chart image of the data with a Y -axis range of 0—3:

= GLINECHART ( O , 3 , $timeCourse)

This ﬁinction evaluates to a URL, which in turn is interpreted
by the VizMapper as a node image, resulting in integrated network
visualizations such as those shown in Figure 1A and B.

3 CONCLUSION

Custom node graphics provide a new tool for non-programmers
that allows rich new network visualizations to be created that
integrate large and complex datasets. Equations provide a powerful
mechanism for data transformation within Cytoscape. Together,
these features can be used to embed rich visualizations of data within
the nodes of large networks.

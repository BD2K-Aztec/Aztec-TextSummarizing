ABSTRACT

Summary: High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have
spurred the development of numerous novel methods for genome
assembly. With few exceptions, these algorithms are heuristic and
require one or more parameters to be manually set by the user.
One approach to parameter tuning involves assembling data from
an organism with an available high-quality reference genome, and
measuring assembly accuracy using some metrics.

We developed a system to measure assembly quality under
several scoring metrics, and to compare assembly quality across a
variety of assemblers, sequence data types, and parameter choices.
When used in conjunction with training data such as a high-quality
reference genome and sequence reads from the same organism, our
program can be used to manually identify an optimal sequencing and
assembly strategy for de novo sequencing of related organisms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Given high-throughput sequencing data, most current genome
assemblers apply deterministic heuristics to infer the genome
sequence. Usually a variety of parameters can be used to control
the heuristic, for which the optimal combination of values may
not be obvious. Given a training dataset consisting of high-
quality reference genomes and sequence reads generated from those
genomes, it may be possible to manually or automatically select a
good set of assembly parameters. A key requirement for this task is
a means to quantify the accuracy of an assembly.

Measuring the accuracy with which an assembly reconstructs the
reference genome presents another inference problem. It is usually
unknown which part of the inferred assembly corresponds to which
part of the reference genome. We must somehow map parts of
the assembly back onto the reference genome through sequence
alignment, which usually takes one of two forms: local alignment,
exempliﬁed by algorithms like BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), and
whole genome alignment with algorithms like MUMmer (Kurtz
et al., 2004) or Mauve (Darling et al., 2004).

We introduce a new set of assembly accuracy metrics based on
the progressiveMauve genome aligner (Darling et al., 2010).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In our method, the assembly contigs and/or scaffolds are ﬁrst
reordered to match a reference genome with the Mauve Contig
Mover (Rissman et al., 2009). The ordered, aligned assembly is
then compared to the reference to identify differences.

Our method is most closely related to MUMmer’s dnadiff
program, which can measure assembly errors using genome
alignment (Phillippy et al., 2008). We, however, use a different
alignment heuristic and evaluate some new types of error such
as rearrangement distance. Several ongoing efforts are directed at
measuring assembly accuracy on particular datasets, including the
Assemblathon, GAGE and dnGASP. These initiatives use tools like
dnadif f, the Mauve Assembly Metrics, and others.

2 METHODS

In the present work we summarize differences in a pairwise alignment
of the assembly and reference genome [e.g. as computed by
progressiveMauve (Darling et al.. 2010)]. We illustrate this process
by way of example. Given the following reference genome and assembled
genome:

Re f erenc e : AGGCTAGCGCGCGATTAGGATC
AS S embly : AGTAGCGGGCCGATTAAGANC

A genome alignment of the reference and assembly might look like:

Re f erenc e : AGGCTAGCGCG-CGATTAGGATC
Assembly: AG--TAGCGGGCCGATTAAGANC

From this alignment. we would calculate the assembly scoring metrics as
follows (not an exhaustive list of metrics):

0 Miscalled bases: 2 (C—>G and G—>A)

0 Uncalled bases: 1 (N)

0 Extra bases: 1 (Insertion of C in assembly)

0 Missing bases: 2 (Deletion of GC in assembly)
0 Number of extra segments: 1

0 Number of missing segments: 1

In addition to metrics summarizing the number of base miscalls. missing
and extra segments (each also evaluated by dnadif if). our method
produces a variety of other metrics. The location of miscalled bases. missing
segments and extra segments is exported to a tab-delimited text ﬁle for
subsequent analysis. GC content of the missing and extra regions is also
exported. Misassemblies are identiﬁed as rearrangement breakpoints inside
of contigs. The double cut and join (DCJ) distance (Bergeron et al.. 2006)
between the assembly and reference is calculated to estimate the combined
effect of misassembly and lack-of-assembly errors (excess contig breaks)
on rearrangement distance. Finally each protein coding sequence in the
reference genome is checked in the assembly for whether it yields an intact
coding sequence. with types and location of substitution and frameshift errors
reported.

2.1 Assembling genomes of Haloarchaea

In an ongoing effort, we are sequencing de novo the genomes of
60 halophilic archaea. Four of these organisms have high-quality
reference genomes completed independently of our project. We
elected to demonstrate our new assembly metrics on one of these
organisms, Haloferax volcanii strain DS2. This organism has a
4.0 Mbp genome organized into ﬁve circular replicons with about
100 repetitive IS elements of 1—2 Kbp each (Hartman et (11., 2010).
Using 454 and Illumina resequencing data, we generated three
different assemblies to compare with our software. The assemblies
are named volc454, volcV and vochDBA (see Supplementary
Material for sequencing and assembly details).

We scored each assembly against the reference genome using the
aforementioned method. An overview of each assembly’s metrics
is given in Table 1. The location of assembly errors is mapped on
the H. volcanii DS2 reference genome in Figure 1. Finally, Figure 2

illustrates that each sequencing and assembly strategy appears to
have bias in the direction of erroneous base calls.

3 DISCUSSION

The assembly metrics we describe illustrate substantial differences
between sequencing and assembly strategies. For example, the
volc454 assembly captured nearly all coding genes in the reference
genome, but had a high scaffold count relative to the vochDBA
assembly. Striking an ideal balance between assembly error types,
rates and sequencing cost is an exercise left for users of our software.

When a ﬁnished reference genome is available and has been
resequenced, the assembly metrics calculated by our system can
be used to guide selection of sequencing strategy and tune assembly
parameters. The reported metrics may form the basis for a ﬁiture
automated system to perform supervised machine learning of
assembly parameters by conducting a parameter sweep over a large
number of assembly strategies.

Finally, we note that genome alignment algorithms are not perfect
and some differences between the assembly and the reference may
be due to alignment error and not true assembly errors.

Abstract

Motivation: Mean telomere length (MTL) is associated with cancers and age—related diseases,
which necessitates identification of genomic and environmental factors that impact telomere
length dynamics. Here, we present a pilot genome wide association (GWA) study for MTL in South
Asian population using publicly available next generation whole genome sequences (WGS), both
for MTL and genotype calculations.

Results: MTL in the studied population was not correlated with age, which is in accordance with
previous reports. Further, we identified that individuals with Sikh religion had longer telomeres,
which may be the result of complex interaction between genetic background and environmental
factors. Finally, we identified 51 MTL—associated SNPs residing in five loci. The top ones were
located in ADARBZ gene, which has previously been implicated with extreme old age.

Conclusion: Our results show that WGS data can be used in telomere length studies. In addition,
we introduce novel loci implicated in MTL that may be worth considering in further telomere

 

studies.

1 Introduction

Telomeres are repetitive stretches of DNA that cap the ends of
chromosomes. In humans, telomeres are comprised of (TTAGGGM
tandem repeats and vary between 5 and 15 kb in length (Samassekou
et (11., 2010). Among other functions, telomeres protect chromosome
ends from being recognized as double-stranded DNA breaks.
Each cell division results in shortening of telomeric sequences due
to the end replication problem (Blackburn, 1991). In their study,
Takubo et a1. (2002) have calculated that in humans the annual
loss of telomere length ranges between 20 and 60bp. Telomere
length can be restored in cells by telomerase enzyme, which is active
in reproductive and stem cells, partially in leukocytes, as well as in
certain types oftumors (Chen and Chen, 2011).

Significance of telomere length association with various condi-
tions and diseases is clearly demonstrated through multiple studies.
Shortening of telomeres is associated with aging, age-related diseases

(Brouilette et (11., 2007) and certain cancer types (Sanders and
Newman, 2013).

Identification of genetic and environmental factors impacting
telomere length has been repeatedly addressed. From multiple loci
implicated in association with telomere length, those including genes
associated with telomerase were among the most validated ones.
Codd et al. (2013) conducted a meta-analysis of 37 684 individuals
and reported seven loci associated with leukocyte mean telomere
length (MTL), including genes coding for telomerase RNA compo-
nent (TERC), telomerase reverse transcriptase oligonucleotide/oligo-
saccharide-binding fold containing 1 protein (OBFCI), nuclear
assembly factor I ribonucleoprotein (NAFI), regulator of telomere
elongation helicase (RTELI), which are involved in telomere biol-
ogy, and two other loci including ACYPZ and ZNFZOS genes. These
genes, apart from ZNFZOS, were validated or had supportive evi-
dence in a study within the COGS project (Pooley et (11., 2013).

Furthermore, Pooley et al. (2013) found novel telomere length asso—
ciation at 3p14.4 (close to PXK), at 6p22.1 (ZNF311) and at
20q11.2 (BCL2L1) loci. Another study of families with exceptional
longevity analyzed 4289 individuals, and reported two loci
(17q23.2 and 10q11.21) containing novel candidate genes, as well
as validated TERC, MYNN and OBFC1 (Lee et al., 2013).
Association of telomere length with SNPs is partially population
specific, and until now there is no well—accepted genomic factor
determining telomere length and telomere attrition rate. This may
be partially attributed to population—specific genomic variations on
one side, and lack of tools for measuring telomere length from
whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, on the other. Recently, we
have developed a methodology and software Computel that allows
to calculate MTL from WGS data by capturing reads from telomeric
regions via alignment to a special reference sequence. Computel has
been proven to be valid with reference to existing experimental
methods and to outperform other computational approaches
(Nersisyan and Arakelyan, 2015). This gives the opportunity to con—
siderably promote the research aimed at understanding how telo—
mere length is linked to genomic context. In this study, we have
performed a genome wide quantitative trait association study for
MTL in South Asian population, using WGS data both for genotyp—
ing and MTL calculation.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Dataset

The study was conducted on datasets produced by the South Asian
Genome project (Zhi et al., 2014), deposited in European
Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) under accession
number PRJEB5476. We used a dataset containing 2 X 101 bp WGS
reads from Illumina GAIIX at 4>< coverage, as well as corresponding
genotypes from whole blood samples of 168 individuals. The indi—
viduals were sampled from different age groups, religious back—
grounds and language groups, predominantly from India (166 India,
one Kenya, one East Africa). Information on age, sex, religion and
language was available for all the study subjects.

2.2 MTL calculation

MTL was calculated from 4><x coverage WGS reads exploiting
a novel method implemented in the software Computel developed
by our group (Nersisyan and Arakelyan, 2015 ), using its default par—
ameters. MTL data are presented as mean MTL : SD throughout
the text. MTL association with age, sex and religion was evaluated
using linear regression. P values <0.05 were considered significant.
Multiple correction was performed with false discovery rate estima—
tion (FDR) with Benjamini—Hochberg (BH) method. Statistical cal—
culations were performed in R environment.

2.3 Population stratification

We have used an R package GenABEL (Aulchenko et al., 2007)
to analyze the population structure. For dimensionality reduction,
we have performed multidimensional scaling (MDS) with 10 com—
ponents using the EIGENSTRAT algorithm (Price et al., 2006).

2.4 Association analysis

The association analysis was performed with Plink toolset (Purcell
et al., 2007). SNPs with MAF < 0.1 and HWE significance threshold
< 0.1 were excluded, which left us with 4, 106, 441 SNPs with genotyp—
ing rates among samples >99.93%. We used multiple linear regression
model to assess additive effect of minor alleles (0, 1 or 2 copies) on

MTL for each SNP, with adjustment for age, sex, religion and top four
principal components derived from population stratification analysis.

3 Results

3.1 Population structure

Principal component analysis revealed that the first component was
explaining 1.68% of the variability in the data, and top four compo—
nents were amounting to only 5%. However, data projection over the
first and the second principal components demonstrated two distinct
clusters along the first component. The majority of samples were des—
cending from India, but the exact region of birth was unknown, thus,
we tried to explore the clustering based on available subject details,
namely language and religion (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1).
Cluster 1 contained mainly Christian, Hindu, Muslim subjects of dif—
ferent languages, while cluster 2 presented predominantly Punjabi
speaking individuals whose religion was Hindu or Sikh, implying that
these individuals were apparently originating from Punjab region.
This assumption is in agreement with the sample description provided
by the South Asian Genome project (Zhi et al., 2014).

3.2 MTL association with gender, age, language

and religion

The MTL was calculated for all 168 samples. The values were rang—
ing from 3234 to 8738 hp with the mean MTL : SD equal to 5401
i 1153 bp (Supplementary Fig. 1). Further analyses were performed
on 166 individuals born exclusively in India. Linear regression of
MTL with adjustment of age, sex and religion revealed no signifi—
cant association with age (P : 0.23) and sex (P : 0.29), while
Sikh religion was the only factor significantly affecting MTL (P :
0.00451). Moreover, Sikhs had significantly longer MTLs compared
with the rest of the samples (mean difference 816.5 bp, 95%CI :
337.3—1295.7 bp). We then tested whether any differences in age
distribution in the populations could account for deviations in MTL
and no significant difference was found (two—sample t—test of age for
Sikh versus Hindu P : 0.371 1, Sikh versus the rest of samples P :
0.08165). In order to account for distinct genetic background of
Sikhs as compared with other groups, we included principal compo—
nents of population stratification analysis into regression model.
The results showed no significant association of MTL with Sikh reli—
gion, suggesting the religion as an indicator for genetic diversity in
studied samples (Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, multinomial
regression model showed significant association of religion with the
most discriminative PC1 component (Supplementary Table 3).
However, comparison of MTL in Cluster 2 revealed that Sikhs have
significantly longer MTL (mean MTL : SD in Sikhs: 5891 i 1343
bp, in other samples: 5115 i 978 bp, t—test P : 0.001), which sug—
gests more complex nature of influencing factors beyond genetic
background (Supplementary Fig. 2).

In order to evaluate the bias introduced by Sikh samples in MTL—
age association, we excluded those and rerun the regression analysis.
The resulting model (MTL : —14.46 X Age + 5676.76,}?2 : 0.025,
P : 0.09) became consistent with previously reported association
found in South Asians, where MTL was measured with real—time
PCR (Bhupatiraju et al., 2012).

3.3 MTL associated loci

We analyzed 4, 106, 442 filtered SNPs for MTL association, with ad—
justment for age, sex, religion and top four principal components
(xi : 1.002528, see Supplementary Fig. 3 for the QQ—plot of associ—
ation values). The Manhattan plot of filtered SNPs with P < 1 X 10—2

most significant ones were residing in ADARB2 gene. This is an RNA
editing gene of double—stranded RNA adenosine deaminase family.
Sebastiani et al. (2009) detected 10 SNPs in ADARB2 gene, strongly
associated with extreme longevity . Two of those SNPs 7510903420
(P : 1.199 X 10‘s) and 751007147 (17 : 6.908 X 10‘9) were among
the most implicated SNPs in MTL, reported in our study. Additional
three SNPs (752805562, 75884949 and 752805535) had small associ—
ation P values, but did not reach the significance threshold. In total,
five SNPs of ADARB2, associated with extreme old age, are also sup—
posedly associated with MTL. These findings call for further investi—
gation aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms through which
ADARB2 is involved in telomere length regulation and longevity.

At this point of discussion it is worthwhile to identify several limi—
tations of our study. The first and the most important limitation in
GWA analysis was the small sample size, which we had access to. This
dramatically reduced the GWA power to detect associated SNPs, thus,
many functionally relevant SNPs did not reach the significance thresh—
old after multiple correction. Further, we had limited information
about the samples: BMI, smoking habits and other lifestyle details
could serve for adjustment in the association analysis phase and give
some important insights over the MTL aberrations. The next limita—
tion was the inhomogeneity of the studied population. Even though
sampled individuals were descending from South Asia, the genetic
footprints of different religious groups were considerably diverse.

5 Conclusion

Here, we have presented a pilot study of GWA for MTL in South
Asians, where we exploited WGS data for SNP information and for
MTL calculation. Concordance of certain findings with previously
published results validated our approach and demonstrated that the
usage of WGS data can be extended to be utilized in telomere stud—
ies. This eliminates the necessity of conducting additional experi—
ments for telomere length measurement, greatly facilitating further
research. Moreover, there is large amount of already existing WGS
data focused on age—related diseases and cancers, where telomeres
play an important role, and our approach can be used to exploit
available datasets to enrich the results with telomere length data.
Our study showed that Sikhs are distinguished with longer telomeres
compared with other religious groups from South Asia. This phe—
nomenon needs further investigation in order to assess the involve—
ment of genetic and/or environmental factors on telomere length
dynamics. Moreover, our results suggest that not only telomere
length, but also its association with age can be affected by ethnicity.

Finally, we have identified that ADARB2 gene highly impacts telo—
mere length in South Asians. Longevity—related nature of this gene is
characterized in other populations, thus combination of this informa—
tion with our results calls for more investigation to understand the
role of this gene in telomere regulation and ageing in general.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The R/Bioconductor package HiTC facilitates the explor-
ation of high-throughput 3C-based data. It allows users to import and
export ‘C’ data, to transform, normalize, annotate and visualize inter-
action maps. The package operates within the Bioconductor frame-
work and thus offers new opportunities for future development in this
field.

Availability and implementation: The R package HiTC is available
from the Bioconductor website. A detailed vignette provides additional
documentation and help for using the package.

1 INTRODUCTION

The three-dimensional organization of chromosomes and the
physical interactions occurring along and between them play
an important role in the regulation of gene activity. Over the
past 10 years, the development of Chromosome Conformation
Capture (3C)-based techniques has changed our View of nuclear
organization (de Wit and de Laat, 2012). With the emergence of
next-generation sequencing, high-throughput conformation cap-
ture techniques, such as Circular 3C (4C; Simonis et al., 2006),
3C Carbon-Copy (5C; Dostie et al., 2006) or more recently Hi-C
(Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009), have been developed to study the
physical interactions between many loci in parallel.

While the use of high-throughput ‘C’ techniques is expected to
increase in coming years (Dixon et al., 2012; Nora et al., 2012),
bioinformatic methods and software to analyze such data are still
lacking. Here, we present the R/Bioconductor package HiTC
that enables users to Visualize and explore high-throughput ‘C’
data. One advantage of the HiTC package is that it operates
within the open source Bioconductor framework (Gentleman
et al., 2004) and thus offers new opportunities for future devel-
opments in this field. The HiTC package is aimed at biologists
interested in investigating their data and at biostatisticians
involved in the development of new statistical methods which
can be applied to C data.

2 AVAILABLE FUNCTIONALITIES

The HiTC package provides a variety of functionalities to handle
high-throughput C data and is especially suited for Visualization
and basic transformations of 5C and Hi—C data (Supplementary
Fig. 81). Here, we present some of the main functionalities of the
package.

2.1 Importing C data

Two distinct datasets are included in the package. The ﬁrst one is
a 5C dataset (Nora et al., 2012), corresponding to the X inacti-
vation center obtained in Mouse ES cells (GSE35721) and the
second is the Hi-C data from chromosome 14 (GSE18199) pub-
lished by Lieberman-Aiden et a]. (2009). Both Hi-C and 5C
datasets can be imported using a deﬁned csv format. In addition,
the HiTC package is fully compatible with data from the my5C
web tool (Lajoie et al., 2009).

2.2 Quality control

Because of the polymer nature of chromatin, a Hi-C or 5C ex-
periment is expected to be dominated by signal from neighboring
restriction fragments in cis. Quality control provides simple de-
scriptive statistics and graphical outputs to check the prevalence
of cis— and trans-chromosomal interactions, and to assess
whether the expected higher frequency between sites located
near each other in the linear genome is veriﬁed.

2.3 Visualization

An interaction map is a two-dimensional heatmap representation
of the matrix of 5C or Hi-C counts, whose entries correspond to
the number of times two restriction fragments in a given genomic
region have been ligated in 3C and sequenced as a pair. The
HiTC package proposes a list of options to define the appropri-
ate data Visualization, such as contrast, color or counts trimming.
Two different Views are provided: a square heatmap View and a
triangular View (Fig. l). The latter is particularly useful for align-
ing interaction maps and genomic and epigenomic features.

2.4 Interaction map transformation

Depending on the experimental resolution and/or the desired
genomic scale to be Visualized, each pixel of an interaction
map can correspond to a single restriction fragment, several re-
striction fragments or genomic intervals of any given size (and

the ESC E14 and PGK SC interaction maps. The genes and CTCF re-
gions from both strands are displayed in blue and green, respectively

therefore various numbers of restriction fragments). For ex-
ample, 5C allows interaction frequencies to be assessed for
each pair of restriction fragments present in the pool of 5C oligo-
nucleotides. The Hi—C protocol, on the contrary, does not neces-
sarily yield counts for every single pair of restriction fragments,
especially when analyzing large genomes. Hi-C results are thus
typically displayed for genomic bins of an arbitrary size. The
HiTC package provides a binning function to address the inter-
action map transformation. For instance, HiTC enables the same
5C dataset to be displayed either at the restriction-fragment reso-
lution or after binning in 100 Kb or le bins, and these bins
can be chosen to partially overlap or not.

2.5 Interaction map normalization

As mentioned earlier, at small genomic distances, pairs of restric-
tion fragments that are close to each other in the linear genome
will give higher signal than fragments that are further apart. This
leads to most counts mapping to the heatmap diagonal. When
considering any given pair of restriction fragments, it can there-
fore be informative to assess whether the observed counts are
above what would be expected given their genomic distance. The
HiTC package includes a basic normalization function that esti-
mates the interaction counts one would expect if the signal was
only dependent on the genomic distance between the interacting
loci (Fig. 1B). This calculation is based on Lowess averaging of
the observed interaction counts as applied by Bau et a]. (2011).

3 CONCLUSION

Although we are still far from understanding the exact relation-
ship between chromosome conformation and gene or genome
regulations, breakthrough technologies are now available for
the systematic and detailed analysis of nuclear organization.
The analysis of chromosome conformation capture datasets is

quite complex and requires the development of computational
tools, including dedicated statistical methods and Visualization
software, such as the one we propose here. We wish to emphasize
that appropriate interpretation of high-throughput C data can
require pre—processing of the data, in order to eliminate system-
atic biases that can be introduced by the experimental protocol
or that can arise from the intrinsic properties of the genome, such
as a non-homogenous distribution of restriction sites Waffe and
Tanay, 2011; Zhang and McCord, 2012). The R/BioConductor
package HiTC proposes a powerful and extensible framework
for Visualizing and exploring high-throughput C data. It is able
to handle both 5C and Hi-C data and offers new functionalities
such as standard import, data transformation and integrative
Visualization methods. While pre-processing and Visualization
tools started to emerge, other methods such as bias correction,
samples comparison or data integration can be further investi-
gated. In this way, the HiTC package provides a ﬂexible basis for
further developments by the community.

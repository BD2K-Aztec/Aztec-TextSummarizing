ABSTRACT

Summary: microRibonucleic acid (miRNAs) are small regulatory
molecules that act by mRNA degradation or via translational
repression. Although many miRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, a
small subset have differential expression patterns that may give rise
to tissue-specific complexes.

Motivation: This work studies gene targeting patterns amongst
miRNAs with differential expression profiles, and links this to control
and regulation of protein complexes.

Results: We find that, when a pair of miRNAs are not expressed
in the same tissues, there is a higher tendency for them to target
the direct partners of the same hub proteins. At the same time,
they also avoid targeting the same set of hub-spokes. Moreover, the
complexes corresponding to these hub-spokes tend to be specific
and nonoverlapping. This suggests that the effect of miRNAs on the
formation of complexes is specific.

1 INTRODUCTION

microRibonucleic acid (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory
molecules that act by downregulating gene expression at the post-
transcriptional and pre-translational stage. They have an extensive
array of functions and are implicated in diverse processes such as
growth, development and differentiation. They also play important
roles in diseases such as cancer (Meltzer, 2005) and heart disease
(van Rooij and Olson, 2007).

miRNAs are known to play roles in regulating the protein
interaction network. (Liang and Li, 2007) showed that miRNAs
tend to target hubs in a network. Moreover, this regulation is more
important for intermodular hubs than intramodular ones. (Hsu et al.,
2008) further built upon this and discovered that while proteins
directly regulated by miRNAs might not form a network module
themselves, the miRNA-target genes and their interacting neighbors
jointly showed signiﬁcantly higher modularity. This is an early
indication that miRNAs target select components of complexes.
However, it is not until recently when Sass et al. (2011) conﬁrmed
that individual miRNAs or co-expressed miRNAs frequently target

several components of protein complexes, indicating a coordinate
post-transcriptional regulation of protein complexes by miRNAs.
In the human protein interaction network, several large hubs are
often observed (Barabasi and Albert, 1999), usually corresponding
to critical gene or biological process regulators (Jeong et al., 2001).
The partners (hub-spokes) are functional units controlled by the
hub, and can be considered as part of a functional unit such as a
complex. Given that different tissues utilize their gene repertoire
differently, it is inconceivable that interactions between hubs and all
adjoining hub-spokes exist simultaneously since there are limitations
in physical binding area, and so on. One possible mode of control
is via expressional suppression, thereby giving rise to different
or subforms of complexes. Since Sass et al. (2011) showed that
coexpressing miRNAs have a propensity to target complexes, we
extend this by suggesting that anti-coexpressing miRNAs can effect
the formation of different protein complexes by suppressing gene
expression. That is, miRNAs with widely different expression
proﬁles can control mutually exclusive or tissue-speciﬁc biological
processes by impacting on the formation of different complexes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

2.1.1 DIANA DIANA-microT (ver 3.0) calculates parameters for each
miRNA based on binding and conservation levels (Maragkakis et al.. 2009).
The total predicted score of a miRNA-target pair is the weighted sum of
conserved and unconserved miRNA recognition element (MRE) of a gene. A
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a precision score speciﬁc for each interaction
that can be used as a conﬁdence estimate of the correctness of each predicted
miRNA-target relationship is provided in the dataset. The Human dataset is
downloaded from http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr.

2.1.2 Mammalian microRNA expression atlas Human miRNA expression
is based on the dataset of Landgraf et al. (2007). This dataset is extensive
and includes expression information for 516 miRNAs across 79 normal
tissues. cancer tissues and cell lines. Forty normal tissues are extracted for
evaluation.

2.1.3 Human Protein Reference Database Human Protein Reference
Database (HPRD) release 9 at http://www.hprd.org is used as the reference
network (Goel et al.. 2011). It is cleaned using iterative AdjustCD (Liu et al..
2009). No new edges are added. Two iterations are used. Threshold is set
at a score of 0.3 where the functional homogeneity is 0.6 (4800 edges).
Hubs (Supplementary Table Sl) are deﬁned as nodes having 50 or more
connections (based on the long tail of the degree distribution curve) and are
further ﬁltered using Gene Ontology for involvement in biological regulation
process (GO:0050789).

2.1.4 CORUM CORUM September 2009 release at http://mips
.helmholtz-muenchen.de provides a resource of manually annotated protein
complexes from mammalian organisms (Ruepp et al., 2010). A total of 1200
human complexes are used.

2.2 Analytical pipeline

2.2.1 Coexpression calculation using Hamming distance, D A miRNA
expression proﬁle is regarded as a binary vector across a series of 40 normal
tissues (1 for expressed, 0 for not expressed). To relate the degree of similarity
of two miRNAs in terms of expression proﬁle, the Hamming distance (D)
and its P-Value can be calculated based on their intersection as described by
Wu et al. (2003); see Supplementary Materials. To ﬁnd pairs that are strongly
anti-coexpressed, we set a P-Value threshold 5 0.05 and with Hamming
distance 3 35 (maximum is 40).

2.2.2 Spoke ana1 complex intersection analytical pipeline miRNA pairs
identiﬁed as anti-coexpressed are then checked for their hub-spoke targeting
overlap using precision scores from DIANA. Targeted spokes are then
checked for correspondence with known complexes from CORUM. The
overlap between targeted spokes and their corresponding complexes is
calculated and the average overlap reported.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Anti-coexpressed miRNA pairs are few

Based on the expression of 516 miRNAs across 40 normal human
tissues, most miRNAs are coexpressing (Fig. 1 C). This indicates
that many miRNAs tend to be found in the same tissues. Anti-
coexpressed miRNAs are rarer. In order to obtain a reasonably sized
set of anti-coexpressed miRNAs, we deﬁne an anti-coexpressed pair
as any pair with Hamming distance 3 35 (maximum 40) and which
meets a P-value threshold of f 0.05.

Hamming Distance

Fig. 1. (A) Hamming distance against Jaccard distance shows that on
average, anti-coexpressed miRNAs tend to avoid targeting the same
spokes. Adjusted R2 = 0.3, P = 0.00024. (B) miRNA proﬁle pairs (Hamming
distance) are plotted against the normalized average number of hubs (hubs
affected/total number of unique miRNAitarget relationships) in HPRD
whose spokes are targeted. At higher Hamming distances, the tendency to
control hub-spokes increases dramatically. (C) The frequency distribution
of Hamming distance based on all miRNA pairs shows that most miRNA
pairs are coexpressed. (D) In considering all hub-spokes disrupted by anti-
coexpressing complex pairs, it is found that disrupted complexes tend not
to possess common components that can be used to make an alternative
complex (Third Complex).

3.2 Anti-coexpressed miRNAs tend to target
hub-spokes very strongly

From the Cleaned network, we retrieve the ﬁrst-degree neighbors of
each hub (spokes). For each pair of miRNAs with Hamming distance
D, we Check the set of miRNA-targeted hub-spokes across all hubs.
We deﬁne the probability each miRNA targets a hub-spoke based
on the precision score provided in DIANA. We perform simulation
1000 times and take an average of the overlap of targeted hub-spokes
between the miRNA pair.

We divide D into four bins: 39, 10—19, 20—29 and >29. For
each bin, to quantify hub-spoke targeting propensity, the number of
affected hubs is divided over the total number of unique miRNA-
target pairs. This provides conﬁdence that the hub-spoke targeting
is not spurious as a result of many predicted targets. This is also
important because we realize from Figure 1C that there are many
co-expressed miRNAs, and the likelihood of targeting a hub-spoke is
therefore quite high. However, in Figure 1 B, it is observed that anti-
coexpressing miRNAs tend to target hub-spokes with signiﬁcantly
higher propensity.

3.3 Anti-coexpressed miRNAs avoid targeting the same
set of hub-spokes

Although anti-coexpressing miRNAs tend to target hub-spokes,
they do not target the same spokes or complexes. We measure
overlap by Jaccard Distance (J score) for a given miRNA pair with
a Hamming distance D. J score is calculated as the intersection
of targeted hub-spokes between a given miRNA pair divided by
their respective union. Here, J decreases linearly with increasing
D. Aside from a single outlier, a non-binned plot shows a well-
deﬁned linear anti-correlation (P = 0.00024) (Fig. 1A). This suggests
that anti-coexpressed miRNAs also avoid each other’s targets. This
antagonism may give rise to differential functionality, e.g. different
complexes being formed. Moreover, this control appears quite
speciﬁc: only a small subset of CORUM complexes (54/1200) are
controlled by these anti-coexpressed pairs.

3.4 Reproducibility in other prediction algorithms

To show that the above observations are reproducible, we perform
similar analysis using PiCTar (Krek et al., 2005), PITA (Kertesz
et al., 2007) and TargetScan 5.1 (TS) (Friedman et al., 2009). The
propensity to target hub-spokes by anti-coexpressed miRNAs in TS,
Pich and PITA is similar (Supplementary Fig. S5). All show that
anti-coexpressed miRNAs have a signiﬁcantly higher propensity to
target the spokes of hubs.

In all datasets, D and J are consistently inversely related
(Supplementary Fig. 6). This strongly supports the notion that
anti-coexpressed miRNAs avoid each other’s targets and may
be important in the formation of different protein complexes or
acquiring tissue-speciﬁc ﬁinctionalities.

3.5 Case study on miR-29b Triad

To better understand the ﬁinctional control between anti-
coexpressed miRNAs, we construct an anti-coexpression network
(Supplementary Fig. S3); where the nodes are miRNAs and edges
are anti-coexpression relationships. The anti-coexpression triad
consisting of miR-29b and miR-140-5p, both anti-coexpressed
against miR-499-5p (Supplementary Fig. S4), is selected for further

The role of miRNAs in complex formation control

 

study. miRs-140-5p and 29b are both ubiquitously expressed (38/40
tissues), whereas miR-499-5p is found only in heart. miR-29b is
found in all tissues except heart and uterus, whereas miR-140-5p is
found in all except heart and B-Cell. Due to these expression patterns,
we hypothesize that the removal of targets of miRs-29b and 140-5p
in heart tissue should affect the acquisition of ﬁinctions speciﬁc to
heart.

Using human tissue-speciﬁc networks generated by (Emig and
Albrecht, 2011), we compare heart and liver networks and Check
the affected nodes and edges if miRs-29b and 140-5-p are
allowed to be expressed in heart using the target predictions in
DIANA. We then test these affected nodes for GO term ﬁinction
enrichment. If miRs-29b and 140-5p were allowed to be expressed
in heart, their high conﬁdence targets (precision 3 0.9) would affect
blood related, extra-cellular matrix, Chemical stimulation (miR-
29b) and nervous system development (miR-140-5p) ﬁinctions in
addition to other more generic functions (Supplementary Table S2).
For pathway enrichment, in miR-29b, we ﬁnd ‘myometrial
relaxation and contraction pathway’ and ‘Calcium regulation in
cardiac cell’ (P 3001). These suggest that removal of miRs-29b
and miR-140-5p target genes affects heart-related function and
indicate that tissue-speciﬁc miRNAs do regulate tissue-speciﬁc
functions.

3.6 How miRNAs may control BAF complex in
VPA-treated mice

To ﬁirther show that miRNAs disrupt complexes speciﬁcally, we
examine the disrupted complexes where there is experimental
evidence for both miRNA upregulation and mRNA downregulation.
However, this dataset comes from mouse.

Valproic Acid (VPA) is used medically as an anticonvulsant
and a mood stabilizer, but has effects on learning and memory
(Bredy and Barad, 2008). It functions primarily as an epigenetic
regulator via its histone deacetylase inhibitor activity. The treatment
of mice over a 2-day period with VPA also indicates readjustment of
miRNA levels in the brain. There are 136 overexpressed miRNAs
and 1000 downregulated genes; for details, see Supplementary
Material.

The effects of VPA treatment on the brain is well studied. Its
role in epigenetic remodeling has a tangible impact on neuronal
differentiation (Kondo, 2006). VPA prompts the differentiation of
hippocampal neural progenitor cells into neurons, but also prevents
differentiation into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (Hsieh et al.,
2004). In a screen of several psychoactive drugs in rats, it has been
shown that only VPA exerted Clear deﬁnable increase in acetylation
(Perisic et al., 2010).

VPA treatment shows elevation of 136 miRNAs (t-test P f 0.01).
We investigate how VPA mediates its effects via miRNA activity.
To determine which downregulated genes are miRNA targets, we
combine scores from TS (Friedman et al., 2009), PT (Krek et al.,
2005) and DIANA (Maragkakis et al., 2009). Those downregulated
genes with a combined score 309 are deemed high conﬁdence
(236 genes). GO term analysis using GO Term Finder reveals
that a good number of these genes are involved in Chromatin
modiﬁcation (n: 14, P f 2.12e-05), nervous system development
(n = 23, P 3 0.0008) and cell differentiation (n = 32, P 3 0.00129).
This implies that the miRNA targets play a role in epigenetic
regulation and neuronal maturation.

To investigate ﬁirther, the 236 high conﬁdence miRNA targets
are compared against CORUM (Ruepp et al., 2010). A total of
53 unique complexes are disrupted. Of these, 15 contain HDAC
1 and/or 2. Eight possess Swi/Snf components involved in neuronal
differentiation and neurogenesis. Five belong to the Polycomb
family of epigenetic regulating complexes, which play a role in
cell fate transition and neuronal differentiation (Bracken et al.,
2006). And eight complexes are SMAD regulators, which act as
transcription factors. In particular, SMAD can induce proliferation
and differentiation of hippocampal neurons via brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and transforming growth factor beta
(Lu et al., 2005).

Several disrupted complexes are involved in neuronal function.
For instance, SNARE, BHC and HPRClL. Another, the BRGl/brm-
associated factor (BAF) family of complexes, act as a switch in
neuronal differentiation, and exists in two forms; neural progenitor
(anAF) and matured (nBAF). As neural progenitors exit mitosis
and differentiate into neurons, anAF complexes, which contain
ACTL6a and PHF10, are exchanged for ACTL6b and DPFl/DPF3
subunits in nBAF. The anAF complex is essential for self-
renewal/proliferative capacity of multipotent neural stem cells. The
nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the
activity of genes essential for dendrite growth.

Yoo et al. (2009) reported that the transition from anAF to
nBAF is mediated by repression of ACTL6a by miR-9* and miR-
124. Our miRNA Chip analysis in the 2-day period also indicates
that miR-9* and miR-124 are strongly upregulated due to VPA,
with corresponding decrease in ACTL6a levels. This agrees with
the article. However, it appears that VPA response is not so
simple. First, there are a multitude of 137 signiﬁcantly upregulated
miRNAs of which miR-9* and miR-124 are only two. Second, the
downregulation of ACTL6a is not very signiﬁcant.

Therefore, we Check the expression level of PHF10, another
component of anAF. We ﬁnd that its expression level increases
signiﬁcantly (t-test, P =0.01). However, PHF10 is not a strong
miRNA target and is predicted as a target of upregulated miR-96
by only DIANA (precision = 0.46).

To investigate further, we Check the nBAF-speciﬁc components
expression as well. We ﬁnd that both ACTL6b and DPFl levels,
speciﬁc components of anAF, are decreased. In particular, DPFl
decrease is signiﬁcant for both probes (t-test, P = 0.01 and 0.02).
DPFl is also a predicted target for a multitude of miRNAs and
supported by TargetScan, DIANA and PicTar with a combined
precision score of 0.81 (for only upregulated miRNAs). This
suggests that DPFl is likely to be regulated by the upregulated
miRNAs. The expression levels and targeting miRNAs for DPFl
and PHF10 are found in Supplementary Table S3.

The rise in precursor BAF components may correspond to
VPA’s neurological effects. Additionally, it appears that this effect
is mediated by miRNA activity. However, the role of miRNAs
in regulating the BAF switch appears to be complex. First,
both ACTL6a and ACTL6b, components of anAF and nBAF,
respectively, are downregulated. However, neither of these show
signiﬁcant downregulation relative to controls. Furthermore, it was
reported by (Yoo et al., 2009) that ACTL6a expression tends
to repress ACTL6b. In the case of ACTL6a, it appears that the
upregulation of known targeters miR-9* and miR-124 as a result
of VPA treatment do not have a strong effect in its suppression,
suggesting activation of other compensatory processes due to VPA.

On the other hand, PHF10 appears to evade miRNA regulation
whereas DPFl appears to be targeted by a good number of
upregulated miRNAs. This may result in more anAF complexes
being formed, with the possible effect of reactivation of neural
plasticity and learning in adult mice.

4 CONCLUSON

We have shown how miRNA expression patterns could impact
the formation of complexes. First, anti-coexpressed miRNAs tend
to regulate hub-spokes signiﬁcantly. Second, anti-coexpressed
miRNAs affect different spokes corresponding to different
complexes. The activity of anti-coexpressed miRNAs is also speciﬁc
in that targeted complexes tend not to have components common
to other complexes, thereby limiting collateral or non-speciﬁc
effects.

miRs-29b and l40-5p are ubiquitously expressed but not in
heart tissue and are anti-coexpressed to miR-499-5p. Furthermore,
the targets of miRs-29b and l40-5p are enriched for heart-related
functions. This reinforces the notion that anti-coexpressed miRNAs
are involved in the acquisition of tissue-speciﬁc functions.

In VPA-treated mice, it appears that miRNAs play a role in the
complex formation. The increase in precursor BAF complexes due
to miRNAs targeting speciﬁc components of the mature form may
have a signiﬁcant effect in the psychoactive effects of VPA, e.g. by
allowing reversion to a higher level of brain plasticity.

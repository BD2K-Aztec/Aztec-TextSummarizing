ABSTRACT

Motivation: Inferring gene-regulatory networks is very crucial in
decoding various complex mechanisms in biological systems.
Synthesis of a fully functional transcriptional factor/protein from DNA
involves series of reactions, leading to a delay in gene regulation. The
complexity increases with the dynamic delay induced by other small
molecules involved in gene regulation, and noisy cellular environment.
The dynamic delay in gene regulation is quite evident in high-temporal
live cell lineage-imaging data. Although a number of gene-network-
inference methods are proposed, most of them ignore the associated
dynamic time delay.

Results: Here, we propose DDGni (dynamic delay gene-network
inference), a novel gene-network-inference algorithm based on the
gapped local alignment of gene-expression profiles. The local
alignment can detect short-term gene regulations, that are usually
overlooked by traditional correlation and mutual Information based
methods. DDGni uses ‘gaps’ to handle the dynamic delay and
non-uniform sampling frequency in high-temporal data, like live cell
imaging data. Our algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and yeast cell
cycle data, and Caenorhabditis elegans live cell imaging data against
other prominent methods. The area under the curve of our method
is significantly higher when compared to other methods on all three
datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological systems involve collaborations at various levels, from
the atomic interactions to more complex ecosystems. Network
formulation will enable a better understanding of such complex
systems. In particular, the interplay between genes and the
networks they constitute are of great interest to many biologists.
Gene networks can help us to comprehend the cause, prognosis

and to prioritize drug targets of various diseases
(Madhamshettiwar et al., 2012). The spatial and temporal
dynamics in gene-expression patterns can reveal regulatory
pathways (networks) and thereby help us to understand vari-
ous underlying mechanisms (Davidson and Levine, 2005).
Recent advances in live cell imaging techniques have enabled
continuous documentation of cell divisions and quantitative
measurement of gene expressions for each cell throughout
embryogenesis (Murray et al., 2006). Inferring regulatory net-
works from such data will help to decode various regulatory
mechanisms involved in tissue differentiation and embryonic
development.

Reconstruction of gene-regulatory networks (GRN) accur-
ately from high-temporal data is fundamental but still remains
a challenge. Gene regulations are not spontaneous (Josic et al.,
2011); various processes are involved in producing fully func-
tional and measurable concentrations of transcriptional factors/
proteins. Each process takes time, leading to the delay in gene
regulation (Zhu et al., 2007). Furthermore, cellular mRNA
and protein concentrations are substantially inﬂuenced by
noisy cellular environment and other small molecules involved
in gene regulation (Bratsun et al., 2005). These ﬂuctuations
(noise) can lead to the dynamic increase or decrease in delay,
during transcriptional regulation as illustrated in Figure 1a
(Blake et al., 2003). The dynamic delay in gene regulation is
quite evident in high-temporal live cell lineage-imaging data
(Murray et al., 2006).

Quite a number of gene-network-inference methods are pro-
posed. However, their performance varies on different datasets
with respective limitations. For instance, correlation based meth-
ods perform better in predicting linear relationships whereas,
information theoretic (Mutual Information, MI) based methods
are better for non-linear relationships. Network topology is also
critical, as some methods are more suitable for ErdosiRenyi
random topology and others for standard small world scale
free networks (Stolovitzky et al., 2009). Most of the methods
perform better on steady state data as compared to temporal
data (Marbach et al., 2010), due to the ﬂuctuations in magnitude
and the delay in gene expression.

Current GRN—inference methods mainly focus on transcrip-
tional events. However, most of them ignore the associated
dynamic time delay. Cross-correlation—based methods can identify

delayed correlations. Nonetheless, to ﬁnd the maximal delayed
correlation, one needs to compute correlations for all the N—I
possible delays between a regulator and its target, where N is
the number of time points in the gene-expression data (Rhudy
et al., 2010); this makes it computationally expensive for high-
temporal data. Moreover, it cannot be applied for identiﬁcation
of non-linear relationships. On the other hand, although the time-
delayed MI based methods can predict non-linear relationships,
yet there is a need to compute MI for all the N—I possible delays.
MI assumes long sampling intervals and statistical independence
between time points (Huang et al., 2010). However, this assump-
tion is not valid for continuous live-cell-imaging data aVIurray
et al., 2006) as the expression at time t is dependent on its previous
time stamp and it is imperative to consider such dependencies.
Time Delay-ARACNE (Zoppoli et al., 2010) is a three-step
information-theoretic—based method. Starting with the gene-
expression change-point analysis, it is followed by network
construction and then pruning. However, being an information

theoretic method, it inherits limitations such as statistical
independence between time points and long sampling intervals
(Huang et al., 2010).

GeneReg (Huang et al., 2010) is a regression-based method
similar to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). It uses a
linear model with time delay and regulation coefficient as its
parameters. This assumes a constant delay between the regulator
and its target. In reality however, the delay is dynamic and is
inﬂuenced by other small molecules involved in gene regulation
and noisy cell environment (Bratsun et al., 2005).

Recently, Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) based similarity
measures are also used to infer time delay gene networks (Aach
and Church, 2001; Lee et al., 2012; Riccadonna et al., 2012).
DTW measures the similarity between two time series by allow-
ing one of the series (query) to expanse or compress at each time
point rather than point to point comparison such that the simi-
larity is maximized. One of the key limitations of DTW is that, it
is a global measure, i.e. DTW assumes that the two time series
overlap on the edges and expanses one of the series to the length
of other series to compute their similarity. However, in reality the
gene expression is dynamic and the regulations are active only
for a subset of time (Prelic et al., 2006). This phenomenon is
clearly observed in developmental and disease-prognosis net-
works (pathways) (Bar-Joseph, 2004). Thus in time-series gene-
expression analysis, it is very important to detect local expression
similarities to understand the underlying molecular dynamics in
biological networks (Androulakis et al., 2007). All these limita-
tions of current methods advocates the need of new gene-net-
work-inference methods, that are least inﬂuenced by the dynamic
expression delays and the number of time points.

Here we present a new network inference method based on the
gapped local alignment of gene-expression proﬁles. Gapped local
alignment was originally used to align two nucleotide or protein
sequences and to find the best matched subsequences (Smith and
Waterman, 1981). Gaps induced in the alignment signify the
insertions and deletions, and alignment score reﬂects the similar-
ity between the two aligned sequences. Here, we employ gapped
local alignment to infer dynamic delay GRN. The rationale
behind the algorithm is that, if a gene X is regulating gene Y,
the expression pattern of the target gene Y is stimulated by the
expression pattern of its regulator X, i.e. they share similar
expression pattern with varying expression delay. A regulatory
relationship is often a local phenomenon due to the dynamic
nature of gene regulation (e.g. different co-factor binding).
Figure 1b and c shows the example local expression correlations
(shaded). By identifying such common local patterns between a
regulator and its target, we can reveal the relationships between
them. Figure 1(d) shows positive regulation between the genes
pal-1 and elt-1 in the C lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans
(Murray et al., 2012). It can be observed that the delay is not
constant throughout the expression, i.e. DI 7ED2 (Fig. 1d).
Insertion of gaps in the alignment will incorporate dummy
time points that can account for the variability in delay.
Instead of mapping the expression values one to one, we stretch
the expression values of one gene over other by inserting gaps,
such that the similarity between the two expression patterns
(regulator and its target) is maximized. A detailed description
of the algorithm is given in the Methods section.

Dynamic delay gene network inference

 

2 METHODS

2.1 Gapped local alignment of expression proﬁles

Here, we employed dynamic programming approach to align two expres-
sion patterns with varying delay and number of time points. Consider the
expression patterns of two genes A and B with x and y number of time
points, respectively:

A =ai,az,aa, “wax
B=b1,b2,b3, “aby-

First, a similarity matrix S of the order x x y is computed. We compute
the similarity s(i,j) as an exponential function of the distance between
time points a,- and 

s(i,j) = {WWW (1)

where or is the measure of steepness and d(a,-,b,~) is the distance between
time points a,- and  A value of or = 1.7 is used in this study (discussed in
Supplementary Material). Euclidean distance is the most commonly used
distance metric. However, it is heavily inﬂuenced by the magnitude of the
difference between the data points. We are more interested in the trend of
expression than the change in magnitude. Thus we capture the expression
trend at a,- and b, with respect to their neighboring data points as shown
below (Supplementary Material):

[(ai) = [(ai — L1H) + (“H1 — ai71)/2]/2 (2)

[(bi) = [(bi — 17:21) + (bi+1 — bH)/Z]/2 (3)

The underlying rationale, i.e. a regulator and its target share a similar
expression trend irrespective of huge variations in the magnitude.
Distance between the two expression trends, d(a,-, 1),) is computed as
shown below:

dull-J71) = lt(ai) - t(bj)l- (4)

Next, an alignment matrix M of the order (x+ 1) x (y + 1) is computed.
An extra row and column are added to allow gaps of any length in either
of the expression patterns (Fig. 2a). Typically, an un-gaped alignment
approximately requires n2 computations, where n is the average length
of the time series. If we consider gap insertions, the computational com-
plexity increases exponentially. Thus, we adopted the dynamic
programing approach to reduce the number of computations to compute
the gapped alignment. The value of the (i, J)-th element in the alignment
matrix M is computed from its adjacent cells in three possible ways
(positions) (Fig. 2a), a diagonal position (if 1) and (1'71) with no gaps,
or from (if 1) and j with a gap inserted in series A, or from i and (1'71)
with a gap inserted in series B.

and p is the gap penalty. In the current study, a gap penalty of 0.3 is used
(discussed in Supplementary Material). However, it is recommend that
different gap penalties be used, based on the diversity of gene-expression
patterns. At each step, the direction (path) of the highest score is
recorded. Once the alignment matrix is completely ﬁlled, we compute
the alignment by joining all the recorded paths starting from the max-
imum element in the matrix, as illustrated in Figure 2. Alignment score N
is computed as:

  

where, Max(M) is the maximum element in the alignment matrix M
and L is the alignment length. Multiple alignments are possible if
there is more than one path from the maximum element in the alignment
matrix M.

2.2 Minimizing the effect of shift and scale

In the current context of gene-network inference, we are more interested
in the expression trend of a gene than the actual change in its magnitude.
Figure 3a shows the model-expression patterns of two genes with similar
local trend, but high noise with different scale and shift makes it difﬁcult
to understand the trend similarity. Thus, the expression patterns are
normalized prior to the alignment by subtracting the mean and dividing
by the maximum:

T,- — T
Tmax

 

T,- = (7)
where, T,- is the i-th element, T is the mean and Tmax is the maximum
value of the time series T. This constrains the expression patterns between
71 and +1 with a unit variance and zero mean. The trend is more obvious
after normalization as shown in Figure 3b. In a similarity matrix high
similarity between any two time points might force the less similar neigh-
boring points to align. To minimize this, we normalize the similarity
matrix as follows:

where, s(i, j) is the (i, j)-th element in the similarity matrix, 3(1', j) is the
average and m(i, J) is the maximum of the i-th row and j-th column of the
similarity matrix S. By doing so, inﬂuence of the high similarity between
the time points i and j is restricted to i-th row and j-th column.

2.3 Aligning inhibitors to targets

The expression patterns of inhibitor and its target are inverted on the time
axis with respect to each other as shown in Figure 30. To comprehend such
relationships we ﬂip the expression pattern of inhibitor by an inverse op-
eration before aligning it to its target (shown in green, Fig. 30). For every
gene pair, we perform both direct and inverted alignments and the mode of
regulation is inferred based on the high-scoring signiﬁcant alignment.

2.4 Inferring regulator—target relationships

We infer a regulatory relationship between any two genes, if they share a
common expression trend. As gene regulations are dynamic and vary
with time, the observed correlations can be local with varying delay.
From Figure 10, we can observe a clear mutual trend between the gene
pal-1 (regulator) and its target elt-l (whose regulatory relationship is well
established). Such common patterns can be identified by high (gapped
local) alignment scores. The direction of regulation is inferred based on
the onset time of gene expressions i.e., the gene with an early onset time is
predicted as regulator and vice versa. In Figure 10 pal-1 is expressed ﬁrst,
and hence is predicted as the regulator of elt-l.

2.5 Signiﬁcance of the alignment

Simple alignment score is not a clear indicator of a signiﬁcant alignment
as the expression pattern of a gene can be randomly aligned to the ex-
pression patterns of other genes. Conventionally, a P-value is calculated
from the distribution of alignment scores to access the significance of an
alignment (Altschul et al., 1997; Pearson, 1996). The distribution of
gapped-local-alignment scores follows an extreme value distribution
(Bailey and Gribskov, 2002). The probability density function for the
generalized extreme value distribution with location parameter )1, scale
parameter a and shape parameterkgé 0 is of the form:

71/1:
f(X'k"‘:")= (1)6xp(—(1+kM) )
a 0
(X — M) T1(’1/k)
(1+k a )

To calculate the P-value, 100 000 random background alignment scores
are computed by shufﬂing the normalized expression levels at random
points (Li et al., 2010). The parameters )1, o and kare estimated based on
these 100 000 random alignment scores. A P-value for a given alignment
score is thus computed based on the estimated parameters. The P-value is
expected to be as small as possible for a signiﬁcant alignment. The R
package ‘evir’ for extreme value distribution to estimate the parameters
and to compute the P-value is used.

2.6 Multiple regulators

We use the window or the interval of regulation to predict collective gene
regulators i.e. multiple regulators regulating their target at the same time. If
a gene is collectively regulated bymore than one gene at a time, they share a
common window of regulation (aligned expression patterns) irrespective of
their magnitudes. Figure 4a shows model-expression patterns of genes a
and c collectively regulating b, in the same window/interval (WI 2 w2). All
the regulators that share a common regulatory window with respect to a
target gene are can be inferred to be its collective regulators. Alternatively,
a gene can also be regulated by multiple regulators at different time points
(windows) as shown in Figure 4b. These relationships are relatively easier
to infer as they have distinct regulatory windows (wl 7e w2). Since DDGni

(Dynamic delay gene-network inference) builds a global network, at this
level it is difﬁcult to distinguish the regulators acting at different time
points. However, DDGni also provides a separate complete alignment
ﬁle with alignment coordinates. The order of multiple regulations can be
inferred based on the order of aligned coordinates i.e. earlier the alignment
earlier is its regulation. This facilitates a better understanding of the under-
lying network dynamics.

3 RESULTS

The merit of the current method DDGni is to infer the dynamic
time delayed GRN. Conventionally, multifactorial DREAM
data is used to evaluate the performance of various GRN-
inference methods. As the DREAM data is a steady-state data
and does not include any time delay in the gene-expression pat-
terns, it is thus rendered incompatible to illustrate the merits of
DDGni on this dataset. Therefore, it was considered imperative
to simulate data that incorporates time delay in the gene expres-
sions in order to highlight the application of DDGni in handling
dynamic time delay. Furthermore, to draw parallels with the
already existing methods, TimeDelay-ARACNE (Zoppoli
et al., 2010), an information theoretic method, is also evaluated
on the same simulated data. The results support the potential of
DDGni in inferring time delayed GRNs (section 3.1).

Furthermore to demonstrate the applicability on steady-state
data, DDGni is also evaluated on multifactorial DREAM 4 data
(with no time delay), against three more prominent network
inference methods: Maximal information coefficient (MIC)
(Reshef et al., 2011), ARACNE (Margolin et al., 2006) and
GENIE3 (Huynh-Thu et al., 2010). GeneNetWeaver (Schaffter
et al., 2011) is used to generate the DREAM 4 multifactorial
data. The performance of all four methods is quite comparable
as shown in Supplementary Table S1.

To assess the practical application of DDGni, we used the cell-
cycle time-course data from Yeast (Spellman et al., 1998) and
real time embryonic gene-expression data from C .elegans
(Murray et al., 2012), as discussed in section 3.2 and 3.3 respec-
tively. The performance of DDGni is evaluated against TD-
ARACNE and DTW. The AUC (Baldi et al., 2000) values
show a substantially increased performance of DDGni as com-
pared to TD-ARACNE and DTW.

3.1 Simulated gene-expression dataset

We generated synthetic gene networks with different topologies,
sizes and most importantly varying time delay as follows.

the initial delay.

0 Dynamic delay (d) is updated at every time point (i) accord-
ing to the dynamic delay factor (dd). The value of dd is based
on a random number n [0, 1], ddzil if (n<x), 0 if
(x 5 nfy) and 71 if (y<n). To minimize the large ﬂuctu-
ations in delay we used x: 0.1 and y = 0.9.

DDGni, TD-ARACNE and DTW are evaluated on 100
synthetic networks with dynamic delay (see Supplementary
Material). The current problem boils down to a simple binary
classiﬁcation problem, i.e. to classify a gene pair as interacting
(regulatory relationship) or non-interacting (no regulatory rela-
tionship). Conventionally, area under the receiver-operating
characteristic (ROC) curve is used to evaluate the performance
of binary classiﬁers with respect to its discrimination threshold
(Madhamshettiwar et al., 2012). ROC is a function of true posi-
tive rate (tpr) and false positive rate (fpr) (Baldi et al., 2000).
Alignment score is the discrimination factor here. The advantage
of using AUC is that, we need not optimize a discrimination
threshold. Figure 5 shows the range of AUC values of DDGni,
TD-ARACNE and DTW, observed over the 100 simulated
networks. The AUC values of DDGni are higher when com-
pared to the other two (Fig. 5 and Table 1). This suggests the
ability of DDGni to handle the dynamic delay embedded in the

3.2 Cell cycle time-course data from Yeast

Next, we evaluated our method on a well-established network of
eight transcriptional factors in Yeast. The cell cycle time-course
gene-expression data is downloaded from GEO (GSE8799).
The dataset consist of two replicates with 15 time points each.
We merged both the replicates to get 30 time points. We selected
eight TFs WOXI, STBl, HCMl, WH15, YHPl, ACE2, SW15
and ASH1) that are extensively studied (Orlando et al., 2008).
The regulatory relationships among these eight TFs are
obtained from literature, YEASTRACT (Abdulrehman et al.,
2011) and STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2011). Figure 6 shows
the time delayed regulatory relationship between SWI5:ASH-1
(Fig. 6a) and YOXleHPl (Fig. 6b). The AUC values reported
in Table 1 show a substantial increase in the performance of
DDGni when compared to other methods.

et al. (2008) have developed methods to quantitatively measure
the gene expressions of every cell with l-min interval during
embryogenesis. Using these protocols Murray et al. (2012)
have measured the expression values of 127 genes, mostly tran-
scription factors with ~1 min temporal and single cell resolution
in C.elegans embryo. The resulting expression patterns from
these cell lineages are rich in information, including tissue
types, cellular physical positions and cell division and
symmetries. Inferring regulatory networks from such data will
help us understand various regulatory mechanisms involved in
tissue differentiation and embryonic development. Figure 6
shows the time delayed regulatory relationship between
HND-1:HLH-1 (Fig. 6c) and PAL-1:ELT-1 (Fig. 6d) in the C
lineage of C.elegans.

3.3.] Interpolation of gene expression values The expression
values of 127 genes are measured independently (one
reporter gene per embryo) by quantifying the ﬂuorescent
reporter expression driven by their promoter sequences.
Ideally, a cell should have the same cell-cycle length across all
experiments. However, due to specific experimental conditions
the cell-cycle lengths might vary across different embryos.
This may be also due to non-uniform and irregular sampling
that are common while tracking embryonic development
(White et al., 1999).

Figure 7 shows the differences in the cell division times for two
genes (experiments) end-1 and pha—4 in the E lineage of C.elegans
(cell division events are marked by a solid black line). It can be
observed that pha-4 cell cycle lengths are shorter when compared
to that of end-1. These differences should be handled before
proceeding to their alignment. Interpolation technique is used
to ﬁt the pha-4 curve to end-1. B-splines are already used
successfully on similar gene-expression data (Bar-Joseph et al.,
2003). The red dotted regions in Figure 7 are the interpolations
of pha-4 expression.

3.3.2 Benchmark data To evaluate our method on real
time embryonic gene-expression data, we manually curated a
benchmark dataset from the available literature for which the
embryonic gene expression data is available (Supplementary
Table S5). The AUC values reported in Table 1 suggest
an enhanced performance of DDGni as compared to TD-
ARACNE and DTW.

The AUC of ROC curve can suggest the overall performance
of a program without needing to consider the specific cutoffs.

Fig. 8. Networks inferred from (a) DDGni, (b) TD-ARACNE and
(c) DTW. Solid lines, true positives; dotted lines, false negatives;
dashed lines, false positives

However, TD-ARACNE is a binary classiﬁer, i.e. it outputs 1
or 0 corresponding to the presence or absence of a regulatory
edge, respectively. Thus, we also evaluated the performance
in terms of F-score (Powers, 2011) (Supplementary Table S4).
Computational (time) complexity and running time of respective
methods are reported in Supplementary Table S7. The overall
tradeoff between AUC and runtime of DDGni is quite
acceptable.

3.3.3 Evaluation on a well-established network For a better
illustration of the merits of DDGni, we demonstrate the
performance of our method in comparison to TD-ARACNE
on a well-established network in C.elegans. Expression of end-
1, end-3, elt—7, pha-4, ges-l and elt—2 genes are speciﬁc to the E
lineage of C.elegans and are important for the gut development.
Figure 8 shows the networks inferred by DDGni (Fig. 8a), TD-
ARACNE (Fig. 8b) and DTW (Fig. 8c); solid lines are the true
relationships that are also predicted by the respective methods,
dotted lines are the true relationships that are not predicted and
dashed lines are the predictions that are not true (not reported in
literature). From Figure 8, we observe that predictions by
DDGni overlap more with the true relationships when compared
to TD-ARACNE and DTW.

4 CONCLUSION

Although, several methods are proposed to infer regulatory net-
works from temporal data, their performance is not satisfactory,
especially with the dynamic delay associated to the gene regula-
tion. High complexity and limitations of the existing methods in
handling varying time delay, advocates the need of effective gene
network inference methods that are least inﬂuenced by expres-
sion delays and number of time points. In this study, we

Dynamic delay gene network inference

 

proposed a simple and elegant network inference method based
on gapped local alignment of gene expression proﬁles. By iden-
tifying common local patterns between a regulator and its target,
we can reveal the regulatory relationship between them. In short,
we span the expression values (time points) of the target gene
over the expression values of its potential regulator by inserting
gaps such that the similarity between the two expression patterns
is maximized. The novelty of our method is the use of ‘gaps’ to
handle the dynamic delay in gene regulation and uniformly
sampled time points which is quite common in long time series
such as cell-lineage data. The order of multiple regulations can be
inferred based on the order of aligned coordinates, i.e. earlier the
alignment earlier is its regulation. The proposed method is com-
putationally less complex and exercise dynamic programming.
We evaluated our performance against prominent network infer-
ence methods like TD-ARACNE, DTW, MIC, ARACNE and
GENIE3. The AUC values for both real time and simulated time
series gene-expression data evince an improved performance by
our proposed method in handling the dynamic delay during tran-
scriptional regulation and the evaluation on steady state
DERAM4 data suggests the on-par performance of DDGni
with other prominent methods. DDGni is highly suitable for
real temporal data with high sampling frequency where delay
dynamics is obvious. It is also applicable to short time-series
data as suggested by its performance on the yeast cell-cycle
data. In addition to the above, its on-par performance on
static data advocates a more general applicability. However, as
any other pure expression driven method it suffers from spurious
relationships, i.e. identiﬁed correlations (delayed-similarity) do
not represent true causal relationships. This problem can be
solved by using ChIP-Seq binding data (Qin et al., 2011).
However, in this article only expression data is used for network
construction.

Abstract

Motivation: Recent advances of next—generation sequence technologies have made it possible to
rapidly and inexpensively identify gene variations. Knowing the disease association of these gene
variations is important for early intervention to treat deadly diseases and provide possible targets
to cure these diseases. Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many individual
genes associated with common diseases. To exploit the large amount of data obtained from
GWAS studies and leverage our understanding of common as well as rare diseases, we have
developed a knowledge—based approach to predict gene—disease associations. We first derive
gene—gene mutual information by utilizing the cooccurrence of genes in known gene—disease asso—
ciation data. Subsequently, the mutual information is combined with known protein—protein inter—
action networks by a boosted tree regression method.

Results: The method called Know—GENE is compared with the method of random walking on the
heterogeneous network using the same input data. For a set of 960 diseases, using the same train—
ing data in testing in 3—fold cross—validation, the average recall rate within the top ranked 100 genes
by Know—GENE is 65.0% compared with 37.9% by the state ofthe art random walking on heteroge—
neous network. This significant improvement is mostly due to the inclusion of knowledge—based
mutual information.

Availability and Implementation: Predictions for genes associated with the 960 diseases are avail—
able at http://cssb2.biology.gatech.edu/knowgene.

1 Introduction

Complex diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) are attributed to
both genetic and/or environmental causes (Goldman, 2014).
Environmental toxins cause disease through their effects on genes
(Qi et (11., 2014). Knowing the genes associated with a disease is use-
ful for preventing and curing the disease. It is also fundamentally im-
portant for understanding the biological functions of genes.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) posit that multiple, com-
mon small-risk variants interact to cause common diseases (Reich
and Lander, 2001; TA et (11., 2010). GWAS relies on testing several
hundred thousand common genetic variants found throughout the
human genome in large-control cohorts. Over the past few years,
many gene loci have been implicated as associated with various

human diseases by GWAS (www.genome.gov/gwastudies/) as well
as linkage studies (Morton, 1955).

Despite the fruitful insights provided by GWAS, heritability esti-
mates have shown that large proportions of genetic risk underlying
complex disease have not yet been explained (Manolio et (11., 2009).
This is due to lack of the ability to detect ‘common disease by rare
variants’ using a GWAS approach. The introduction of next-
generation sequencing technologies allows cost-effective sequencing
of entire genomes and has led to the discovery of numerous rare
variants in the human genome. The disease associations of these rare
variants cannot be inferred by GWAS for further experimental veri-
fication. Thus, alternative computational methods that predict the
association of gene with a given disease have been developed

(Kohler et al., 2008; Li and Patra, 2010; Natarajan and Dhillon,
2014; Qian et al., 2014; Singh—Blom et al., 2013; van Driel et al.,
2006; Vanunu et al., 2010). The general idea of prediction methods
is the ‘guilt by association” principle (Wolfe et al., 2005) with respect
to a set of known genes related to the given disease. The most fre—
quently used types of evidence for inference of association are (Fire
and Di Cunto, 2012): (i) text mining of the biomedical literature; (ii)
phenotype relationships such as disease—disease similarity; (iii) pro—
tein—protein interactions; (iv) regulatory information and (v) gene
expression information. For example, Van Driel et al. (2006) used a
text—mining approach to associate genes with human phenotypes
found in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) data—
base (Hamosh et al., 2002). Kohler et al. found gene—disease associ—
ations by using a global network distance measure—a random walk
analysis—for the definition of similarities in protein—protein inter—
action networks (the ‘interactome’). Encouragingly, they find that
this approach significantly outperforms previous methods based on
local distance measures in the interactome (Kohler et al., 2008). A
slightly modified approach called ‘network propagation” that differs
from a random walk only in the normalization of the adjacency ma—
trix W representing the interactome (Qian et al., 2014; Vanunu
et al., 2010) has also been developed. The random walk method nor—
malizes the adjacency matrix W by columns (the summation of each
column equals to one), whereas the network propagation normalizes
W by the diagonal matrix: W,; : Wiy/(/D(i,i)D(/,/) , where
D(i,k) : ZkWik. An extension of the random walk approach is
walking on a heterogeneous network that includes protein—protein
interaction, disease—disease and gene—disease networks (Li and
Patra, 2010). Singh—Blom et al. (2013) have developed a truncated
version of the random walking on a heterogeneous network by using
a limited steps for the walks but it also includes phenotypes from
multiple species. The method uses simple dampening coefficients for
longer walks and learns the coefficients for longer walks using a sup—
port vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). Natarajan
and Dhillon (2014)developed an inductive method that uses a ma—
chine learning approach to incorporate different biological sources
of evidence such as microarray expression data, gene functional
interaction data and disease—related textual data from human as
well as other species. The best performing of the aforementioned
methods for prioritizing genes associated with a given disease is the
inductive matrix completion developed by Natarajan and Dhillon
(2014). It has an average recall rate of 25% within the top 100
ranked genes. There are also many disease specific methods that
focus on a single or group of diseases to prioritize genes for further
experimental validation. For a survey of methods for predicting
gene—disease association, please see Piro and Di Cunto (2012).

Here, we develop a new type of approach for prioritizing candi—
date genes associated with a given disease. Our approach applies the
idea of word association in the context of texts (Church and Hanks,
1990) to gene—gene association in the context of diseases and then
employs gene—gene association to infer gene—disease association.
This is a knowledge—based approach that learns gene—gene associ—
ation propensity in diseases from known gene—disease association. It
is also analogous to methods of knowledge—based statistical poten—
tials for protein structure prediction that learn residue—residue or
atom—atom pairwise interaction potentials from experimental pro—
tein structures (Lu and Skolnick, 2001; Zhou and Zhou, 2002).
Mutual information (Fano, 1961) is used to measure the strength of
gene—gene association in a given disease. Owing to the increasing
amount of data for known gene—disease associations, the mutual in—
formation of gene—gene pairs can be derived from these known asso—
ciations. Subsequently, mutual information is combined with the

properties of the protein—protein physical interaction network by
means of boosted tree regression (Roe et al., 2006). The resulting
method called Know—GENE is then benchmarked in 3—fold cross—
validation (training on 2/3 of the known gene—disease associations
and testing on the remaining 1/3) and compared with network
propagation, random walking on the interactome as well as on the
heterogeneous network—based methods. For 960 diseases defined by
the medical subject headings (MeSHs) ontology with at least two
known seed genes associated with a given disease [as provided by
the OMIM and GWAS databases (Mottaz et al., 2008; Ramos et al.,
2014; Zhang et al., 2010)], using the same input evidence (known
gene—disease association and interactome), Know—GENE achieves a
significantly better recall rate (65 .0%) within the top 100 ranked of
15 948 total screened genes compared with the network propaga—
tion (19.2%), the random walk on interactome (18.1%) and the
random walk on heterogeneous network (37.9%) methods. Thus,
Know—GENE is a promising method for prioritizing candidate genes
associated with a given disease. Then, we apply Know—GENE in pre—
diction mode (training on all known gene—disease associations) to
predict and rank genes in the human exome for each of the 960 dis—
eases. Likewise, our predictions can rank diseases for a given gene, a
useful feature for diagnosing diseases in a given mutated gene. It is
also useful for predicting and understanding possible side effects of
drug targets. Predictions are available for academic users at http://
cssb2.biology.gatech.edu/knowgene.

2 Materials and methods

This work is based on the assumption that gene—disease association
can be inferred from gene—gene functional interactions and protein—
protein physical interactions given a set of genes known to be associ—
ated with a given disease. We will utilize the known protein—protein
physical interaction network and known gene—disease associations
as provided by GWAS (Reich and Lander, 2001; TA et al., 2010)
and linkage studies (Morton, 1955).

2.1 Datasets and sources

Protein—protein physical interactions (interactome) are compiled
from the HIPPIE database (http://cbdIn.mdc—berlin.de/tools/hippie/
hippie_current.txt) (Schaefer et al., 2012) and the work of Menche
et. a1. (2015) (http://Www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6224/12576
01/suppl/DC1). In total, there are 246 502 human protein—protein
interactions involving 15 948 genes/proteins that are experimentally
documented to involve regulatory, metabolic pathway and kinase—
substrate interactions. Among these, 3179 genes are known to be
associated with at least one disease. The interactome data can be
found at http://cssb2.biology.gatech.edu/knowgene.

We then compiled 960 diseases defined by the MeSH ontology
that have at least two associated genes (proteins) in the interactome
from two sources as in: (i) Ref. (Zhang et al., 2010) (http://www.bio
medcentral.com/1755—8794/3/1) that also uses the MeSH disease
definition and (ii) Ref. (Menche et al., 2015) (http://Www.science
mag.org/content/347/6224/1257601/suppl/DC1). The primary sour—
ces of these data are from the genetic association databases (Becker
et al., 2004), the OMIM database (Hamosh et al., 2002) and the
GWAS databases (Mottaz et al., 2008; Ramos et al., 2014). This
provides 31 993 gene—disease associations for 3171 genes. Of these,
283 genes are known to be associated with only one disease, and the
disease association of the remaining 15 948 genes is unknown. The
known association data can also be found at http://cssb2.biology.
gatech.edu/knowgene.

Knowledge—based gene—disease associations

 

2.2 Core genes of a disease

It was found that even with an incomplete interactome, genes associ—
ated with given disease tend to interact with each other and form
connected clusters (Menche et al., 2015 ). A connected cluster con—
sists of genes directly connected (that is interact) to one another in
interactome space. Genes in the largest interacting cluster of a dis—
ease are called core genes. To measure if a cluster is formed by
chance or due to intrinsic properties of the disease, we conduct the
same statistical test as in Ref. (Menche et 41., 2015). For the size
S (number of genes) of the cluster, we calculate the z—score:

s_ < Stand >

0(Srand) 

z — score :
where <Smnd> and 0(Sm‘d) are the average largest cluster size value
and SD of randomly picked Ng number of genes in the interaction
network. Here, Ng is the number of known genes of the considered
disease. To calculate the z—score, we simulate the random process
10 000 times. Each time, Ng genes were randomly selected from the

Srand of the largest connected

15 948 screened genes. Then, the size
cluster from these Ng genes was obtained. The process was repeated
10 000 times. A cluster with z—score > 1.65 (P—value < 0.05) is con—
sidered significant. This leads to 537 of the 960 diseases having a
statistically significant cluster. The largest significant cluster of each
disease gives the core set of genes: i.e. core genes of the disease. The
average number of known genes for the 537 diseases having core
genes is 25.5; whereas for the 423 diseases not having core genes, it
is 9.4. Thus, a disease having core genes usually has more known
genes than diseases lacking core genes.

2.3 Gene—gene pairwise mutual information

Borrowing the idea of measuring word association strength (Church
and Hanks, 1990), to measure the strength of functional association
of two genes in diseases that might include the effect of direct phys—
ical interactions, we use their mutual information (Fano, 1961)
defined as:

P(nggy)

1(gx7gy) —10gP(gX)P(gy) (2)
where P(gx), P(gy) are the probabilities of observing genes gX and gy,
independently in a given disease, and P(gx,gy) is the probability of
observing genes gX and gy, together in a given disease. If there is a
genuine association between genes gX and gy, then the joint probabil—
ity P(gx,gy) will be larger than that by chance, P(gX)P(gy). Thus,
1(gmgy) will be > 0.

In Know—GENE (knowledge—based approach for predicting
gene—disease association), the probabilities P(gx), P(gy) are estimated
by counting the number of genes gx, gy associated with diseases
N(gx) and N(gy), normalized by the number of diseases, Nd (here,
Nd: 960) and P(gx,gy) is estimated by counting the number of cooc—
currences of genes gx, gy associated with the disease N(gx, gy) nor—
malized by Nd.

2.4 Gene—disease association measures

We first consider the network distance of a gene to a given disease.
A unit network distance is defined as a path from one protein to an—
other with a direct connection in the interactome. We bin the short—
est distances of an unknown gene to all the known genes of a given
disease from 1 to 10 and fill each bin with the number of genes
known to be associated with the given disease, i.e. we have a vector
(111, 112,. . ., 1110) with ZnizNg, Ng is total number of known genes
and n, is the number of genes in the known set with shortest distance

i to the unknown gene. A similar histogram is also done for the core
genes (if there is no core gene, all 10 histogram values are zero).

We then consider the functional association strength of an un—
known gene gX to a given disease D that is defined as:

S(Dvgx) : Z P(nggy)1(nggy) (3)
gyED

where the summation is over all known genes of the disease. P(gx,gy)
and 1(gmgy) are the probabilities of observing two genes associated
with a disease together and the resulting mutual information
[Equation (2)], respectively.

To combine the above network distances and functional associ—
ation strength, we employ the boosted tree regression machine learn—
ing method. Boosted tree regression has been employed in many
applications (Friedman and Meulman, 2003; Roe et al., 2006) and
has been shown to be much better than SVMs (Cortes and Vapnik,
1995) and random forests (Breiman, 2001) in predicting genomic
breeding values (Ogutu et al., 2011). It involves generating a se—
quence of decision trees; each grows on the basis of the residuals of
all previous trees (Roe et al., 2006; Thusberg et al., 2011). Here, a
decision tree regression is implemented with a maximal depth of
eight. The scoring function is represented as a boosted decision tree
(Roe et al., 2006):

Ntree
ﬁx) 2 Z sTmoc) (4)

m:1

where Tm is a decision tree, 8 is the shrinkage factor or learning rate,
Ntree is the number of trees and x represents a set of features. In this
application, Ntree is set to 500 and 8: 0.01. The following 23 fea—
tures are derived from the above network distances and mutual
information:

(a) 11 features: histogram of network distances to all known
genes (111, 112,. . .,n10) plus the mean value 2 (n, X i)/Ng,

(b) 11 features: histogram of network distances to all core genes
(11f, nzc, . .,n10c) plus the mean value 2(11,c >< i)/Zn,c, these values are
set to zero for diseases without core genes;

(c) 1 feature for the functional association strength S(D,gx) by
Equation (3).

2.5 Training and testing

We considered 960 diseases and 15 948 genes having protein—pro—
tein interactions. There are 15 310080 gene—disease pairs with 31
993 known associations. To test our method, we perform 3—fold
cross—validation. All gene—disease pairs are randomly partitioned
into three approximately equal size sets. For each set, we use the
other two sets for training the boosted tree regression model and
predict scores for the third, testing set. In the training process, all
known associations are assigned an objective function value of 1
and unknown pairs assigned 0. This might introduce a few false
negatives because unknown ones could be true associations.
However, since the number of unknown associations is much larger
than possible true associations, the chance of a false negative is
small. In the 2/3 of training data pairs, only 0.2% of total gene—dis—
ease pairs are positives (assigned a value of 1). If all pairs are used
for training, the model will be overwhelmingly dominated by nega—
tive samples. Thus, we shall use only a partial set (~4%) of the nega—
tive pairs in the training data for actual training. This results in a
ratio of 1:20 positives versus negatives in the actual training data. In
either training or testing, when calculating the network distances,
the gene is removed from known set of genes for the given disease if
it is a known gene of the disease. Any known association is not

for those lacking core genes. When used for prioritizing diseases for
a given gene, Know—GENE has an average recall rate of 77.1%.

A disadvantage of Know—GENE as well as the method of walk—
ing on the heterogeneous network is that it does not perform well
for genes that are not present in any of the diseases used in deriving
the mutual information (Table 3 test on singletons). In practice, for
such genes, we can choose an alternative method such as Know—
GENE without using mutual information or the network propaga—
tion method.

Possible further improvement of Know—GENE could come from
enriching more genes with more verified disease associations and
including them in deriving mutual information. These could be ful—
filled by literature searches for associations with high Know—GENE
prediction scores and then using the supported associations in train—
ing. This process could be iterated. For those genes without any
known disease associations, other sources for deriving their mutual
information are sought. For example, one possibility is the covari—
ation of gene expression data in individuals with a given disease.
Cooccurrence of gene pairs in pathways is another possible source.
These and other alternatives will be explored in future work.

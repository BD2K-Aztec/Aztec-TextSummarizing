ABSTRACT

Summary: CompleteMOTlFs (cMOTlFs) is an integrated web tool
developed to facilitate systematic discovery of overrepresented
transcription factor binding motifs from high-throughput chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments. Comprehensive annotations and
Boolean logic operations on multiple peak locations enable users to
focus on genomic regions of interest for de novo motif discovery
using tools such as MEME, Weeder and ChlPMunk. The pipeline
incorporates a scanning tool for known motifs from TRANSFAC and
JASPAR databases, and performs an enrichment test using local
or precalculated background models that significantly improve the
motif scanning result. Furthermore, using the cMOTlFs pipeline, we
demonstrated that multiple transcription factors could cooperatively
bind to the upstream of important stem cell differentiation regulators.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression is a complex process that is coordinately regulated
by interactions of multiple transcription factors (TFs) and other
proteins that form promoter and enhancer complexes. The recent
development of next-generation sequencing technologies has made
it possible to determine in vivo and in vitro bindings of diverse
TFs on a genomic scale (i.e. ChIP-Seq). One immediate question
is whether the peak regions are functionally associated with the
transcriptional regulation of target genes. An indication of such
functional associations is the presence of loci occupied by multiple
TFs or highly conserved sequences across species (Wasserman and
Sandelin, 2004). Hence, an important step towards understanding
functional binding events is to study the presence of DNA sequence
motifs in the context of nearby TFs, genomic features and epigenetic
modiﬁcations.

There are several challenges in ﬁnding motifs in peak regions
identiﬁed from TF binding experiments. In the case where only a
subset of ChIP-Seq peaks has common motifs, de novo discovery
tools might not be optimal. Scanning for known motifs is faster and
capable of detecting motifs that appear less frequently; however,
the relatively short (4—25 bp) nature of protein-binding motifs can
produce non-signiﬁcant results. Many tools such as GimmeMOTIFs
(van Heeringen and Veenstra, 2010), Tmod (Sun et al., 2010) and
MoAn (Valen et (11., 2009) have been deployed to identify sequence
motifs, while RSAT (Thomas-Chollier et al., 2008) and Galaxy
(Goecks et al., 2010) provide more comprehensive means to analyse
regulatory sequences in general. Each method has its own strength
in identifying potential transcription factor binding site (TFBS);
however, it is crucial to combine results from complementary
tools (Tompa et (11., 2005) and provide an intuitive interface that
streamlines peak annotation, ﬁltering, motif discovery and summary.

CompleteMOTlFs (cMOTIFs) was developed to provide
biologists an easy to use yet comprehensive web tool for ChIP-seq
data analysis. First, peak regions are annotated with comprehensive
genomic information such as known genes, conservation scores
and repeating sequence elements. Second, Boolean logic operations
such as intersection and union can combine multiple datasets from
different TF bindings or histone modiﬁcation states. Using the
annotation and Boolean operations, users can ﬁlter and combine
peak lists from one or multiple experiments, facilitating the study of
cooperative TF binding events (Farnham, 2009). Third, combining
the top 10 ranked motifs from three de novo methods and known
motif scanning using background models helps to identify novel or
known TFBS of interest as well as possible co-factor binding sites.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The cMOTlFs pipeline was built using MySQL, Perl, CGI and R
statistical language, and the overview of workﬂow is illustrated in
Figure 1.

Input format: the pipeline accepts DNA sequences in FASTA format
or genomic coordinates in BED or GFF formats. Format conversion
tools are provided for human (hng, hgl9), mouse (mm9) and rat
(m4) genomes.

Genomic annotation: cMOTlFs provides annotations from UCSC

Ensembl), multispecies conservation scores (PhastCons) and
repeating sequence elements (RepeatMasker), which enable users to
select regions based on any combination of annotation criteria. The
GOstats R library (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007) was integrated to
the pipeline to summarize enriched Gene Ontology categories for the
peak-associated genes. For instance, users can select peaks, which
are highly conserved, contain no repeating sequence elements, and
are located within 10kb of transcription start sites of known genes,
for subsequent motif discovery processes.

Boolean logic operations with multiple datasets: eight operations
are provided to perform intersection, union, subtraction, common
merge, common region, merge by distance, unique and extension
on multiple genomic-region ﬁles (more details on the web site). For
instance, to identify possible multiple transcription factor binding
loci (MTL), users can merge neighbouring motif-enriched regions
from different TF experiments.

Motif discovery: we incorporated three existing de novo discovery
algorithms [MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1994), Weeder (Pavesi
et al., 2004) and ChIPMunk (Kulakovskiy et al., 2010)] and
a motif scanning method [Patser (Hertz and Stormo, 1999)]
with position-speciﬁc scoring matrices (PSSM) from databases
including TRANSFAC (public version 7.0) (Matys et al., 2003)
and JASPAR (version October 12, 2009) (Bryne et al., 2008)
to prioritize overrepresented motifs. The pipeline also accepts
user-deﬁned PSSM for motif scanning. The Computer Uniﬁed
Device Architecture (CUDA) library enhanced MEME performance
(Liu et al., 2010). A sufﬁx-tree-based exhaustive enumeration
algorithm, Weeder (v1.4.2), and an iterative algorithm that combines
greedy optimization with bootstrapping, ChIPMunk, have been
included. The Patser [version 3b, (Hertz and Stormo, 1999)] is
used to scan motifs from JASPAR and TRANSFAC databases.
After the original Patser scanning, each target sequence is shufﬂed
N times (default N = 1000) while maintaining (mono, di or tri)
nucleotides frequency to create a random background model based
on user input sequences or pre-compiled upstream sequences for
each species. A permutation P-value is calculated from the frequency
of random motif occurrences with the false discovery rate calculation
(Storey and Tibshirani, 2003). This procedure allows estimating the

signiﬁcance of a motif occurrence in a target sequence compared
with a set of randomly shufﬂed sequences. The current version of
the pipeline allows up to a total of 500 000 bases for motif discovery,
and this can be increased to 5 million bases if users choose to run
ChIPMunk alone.

Motif summary: the top 10 motifs from the above four methods are
ranked with corresponding scores and frequencies, and summarized
with the STAMP tool by clustering motifs based on similarities
(Mahony and Benos, 2007), and loci can be saved as BED format
for further visual inspection and iterative analysis. Results are
conﬁdentially stored in users’ personal accounts.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We demonstrated our pipeline with a previously published ChIP-
Seq dataset, which mapped binding locations of 13 TFs involved
in embryonic stem cell differentiation (Chen et al., 2008). For 12
of the 13 TFs (except for E2fl ), the pipeline successfully identiﬁed
the reported binding motifs as the top-ranked motifs. Notably, the
dinucleotide shufﬂing improved motif rankings from Patser (see
Supplementary Material). The pipeline facilitates identiﬁcation of
multiple TF-binding loci. For instance, after processing the top
500 peaks from Nanog, Oct4 (encoded by Poqul gene) and Sox2
TF proﬁles, we found a subset of peaks enriched with known binding
motifs in JASPAR. Using Boolean logic, we merged neighbouring
motif ‘+’ regions within 500 bp and identiﬁed 35 MTL, each of which
was occupied by Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2, suggesting collaborative
binding from all three. These illustrate some examples of complex
gene expression regulations that can be analysed efﬁciently with the
pipeline (see Supplementary Material for the detail).

ABSTRACT

Summary: A number of technologies, including CRISPR/Cas,
transcription activator-like effector nucleases and zinc-finger nucle-
ases, allow the user to target a chosen locus for genome editing or
regulatory interference. Specificity, however, is a major problem, and
the targeted locus must be chosen with care to avoid inadvertently
affecting other loci (‘off-targets’) in the genome. To address this we
have created ‘Genome Target Scan’ (GT-Scan), a flexible web-based
tool that ranks all potential targets in a user-selected region of a
genome in terms of how many off-targets they have. GT-Scan gives
the user flexibility to define the desired characteristics of targets and
off-targets via a simple ‘target rule’, and its interactive output allows
detailed inspection of each of the most promising candidate targets.
GT-Scan can be used to identify optimal targets for CRISPR/Cas sys-
tems, but its flexibility gives it potential to be adapted to other
genome-targeting technologies as well.

Availability and implementation: GT-Scan can be run via the web at:

1 INTRODUCTION

Targeted genome editing and targeted transcriptional control are
essential tools of modern molecular biology. Currently popular
approaches include CRISPR-Cas (Jinek et al., 2012), transcrip-
tion activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and zinc-finger
nucleases (ZFNs) (Miller et al., 2007). Each of these technologies
allows the user to design a system to target a speciﬁc genomic
sequence. However, because of the limited or uncertain sequence
speciﬁcity of technologies based on CRISPR/Cas (Hsu et al.,
2013), TALENs and ZFNs (Gabriel et al., 2011), it is crucial
that the intended genomic target be as unique as possible
within the genome. Ensuring target uniqueness will reduce the
number of ‘off-targets’ in the genome and minimize unintended
genome editing or regulatory effects.

The first step in the effective use of any genome targeting
technology is therefore to identify the possible target(s) within
the region of interest (e. g. gene, exon or promoter) that have the
fewest off-targets. The ideal targets are subsequences within
the region of interest that have no exact copies elsewhere in the
genome. Because targeting afﬁnity is a continuum, near-exact
copies that differ at one or a few positions from the intended

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

target are also undesirable (Jinek et al., 2012). Furthermore, the
positions of the mismatches in off-targets may also affect their
afﬁnity. For example, in the CRISPR/Cas system, mismatches in
5/ positions are generally less disruptive than those in 3/ positions
(Jiang et al., 2013). An exception is a single nucleotide near the 3/
end of the target, which has little or no effect on speciﬁcity,
regardless of the base pair present in that position (Mali et al.,
2013). In ZFN targets, a central ‘spacer’ has little affect on
afﬁnity. Target selection should therefore consider both exact
and near-exact matches to the target as off-targets, as well as
the positions of mismatches in off-targets.

The particular genome editing technology being used may
place other constraints on the ideal targets in addition to
uniqueness. For example, CRISPR/Cas targets must contain a
particular short sequence at the 3/ end called a protospacer
adjacent motif (PAM) (Mali et al., 2013). Target selection must
consider such constraints as well.

2 GT-SCAN

We have developed Genomic Target Scan (GT-Scan) to aid in
the selection of optimal genomic targets for genome editing or
transcriptional control Via systems based on CRISPR/Cas and
other systems. GT-Scan is a ﬂexible web-based tool that scans
a user-deﬁned genomic region for candidate targets and ranks
them in terms of the number of exact or approximate off-targets
in the genome. GT-Scan allows the user to define a ‘target rule’
in a simple format that speciﬁes target length, constrained
positions and positions with high-, low- or no-target (and off-
target) speciﬁcity. GT-Scan’s output is interactive, allowing the
user to examine candidate targets and the characteristics of their
potential off-targets (number of mismatches, positions of
mismatches, genomic locations). The GT-Scan website currently
supports target selection in >25 Ensembl genomes.

To use GT-Scan, the user selects the appropriate genome from
a menu and provides the DNA sequence of the genomic region
in which they wish to identify optimal targets. They then choose
a ‘rule-pair’ consisting of a ‘target rule’ and an ‘off-target filter’,
or they can create their own custom rule-pair. Candidate targets
are positions in the given genomic region (on either strand) that
match the target rule. For each candidate target, GT-scan
reports all potential off-targets in the genome that have
no more than three mismatches with the candidate target and
match the off-target filter. The user can also separately limit the
number of high-speciﬁcity mismatches in off-targets.

The target rule defines high-, low- and no-speciﬁcity positions
in candidate targets, using upper- and lower-case letters

from the alphabet ACGTNX. To illustrate, consider the 23 nt rule-
pair

target rule xxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXNGG
off-target ﬁlter NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNRG,

which is appropriate for CRISPR/Cas9 systems. This target rule
speciﬁes that candidate targets must be 23 nt long and end with
the —NGG PAM. It also encodes the information that the 10 most
5/ positions are low-speciﬁcity positions, and the following 13 are
high-speciﬁcity positions, except for the special character N,
which denotes a ‘no-speciﬁcity’ position. The off-target ﬁlter is
composed of letters in the standard IUPAC alphabet for DNA,
and the letter case has no effect. With the given off-target ﬁlter,
GT-Scan ignores any potential off-target not ending with either
an —NGG or —NAG PAM.

An example of the interactive HTML output produced by
GT-Scan is shown in Figure 1. The job details on the left show
that the user provided GT-Scan with a 50 bp region of DNA and
speciﬁed scanning of the Ensembl human genome version
GRCh37. GT-Scan detected that the candidate region matches
the reference strand of chromosome 21 from position 33 032 335
to 33032384. GT-Scan ran for 8s and found and evaluated
12 candidate targets within the candidate region that match the
23 bp rule chosen by the user. The best candidate target found
by GT-Scan is unique in the human genome (0 in the
‘Exact Match’ column), and no other loci exist that differ
from it by either one or two mismatches (0 in the ‘1 Mismatch’
and ‘2 Mismatches’ columns) Furthermore, only six loci in
the human genome differ from the candidate by as few as
three mismatches (six in the ‘3 Mismatches’ column). The
second best candidate target present in the candidate region is
similarly unique in the human genome allowing up to one mis-
match; however, one locus differs from it by only two
mismatches.

Clicking on a candidate target in the upper table selects it and
displays its potential off-targets in the lower table. The ﬁrst
column of the lower table shows the chosen candidate’s potential

off-targets with mismatches highlighted in bold. High-, low- and
no-speciﬁcity positions are denoted using orange, blue and green,
respectively. The remaining columns show the number of
mismatches in the potential off-target, its chromosomal location,
its GC-content and a clickable link to its locus in a genome
browser.

The GT-Scan algorithm extends the approach of Mali et £11.
(2013) to generalized target rules. Its ﬁrst step is to convert the
target rule into a regular expression by replacing X, x and N with
wildcards. GT-Scan then ﬁnds all the candidate targets in the
user-speciﬁed genomic region by scanning the input sequence for
matches to the regular expression. Next, for each candidate
target, GT-Scan generates a list of all possible off-targets by
listing all possible words that match the candidate target
except (possibly) at positions where the rule contains the no-spe-
ciﬁcity character (N). Note that the running time of GT-Scan
therefore scales exponentially with the number of no-speciﬁcity
characters in the rule (time proportional to 4”, where n is the
number of no-speciﬁcity characters). GT-Scan then combines the
possible off-targets for all targets into a single list of words and
uses the Bowtie algorithm (Langmead et £11., 2009) to identify all
matches to these words anywhere in the selected genome.
Genomic locations with up to three mismatches to any of the
words in the list are reported by Bowtie. Finally, GT-Scan
creates its interactive output report after determining which
off-target locations correspond to each of the candidate targets.
GT-Scan’s report, which can be downloaded as an HTML ﬁle, is
retained on the server for at least 7 days.

GT-Scan ﬁlls a gap in the existing toolset for identifying
optimal genomic targets. CRISPR Design (Hsu et £11., 2013) is
speciﬁcally engineered for target selection for the CRISPR/Cas9
system, does not allow for user-deﬁned rules and currently
limits the candidate region to 250 bp (versus 4000 bp for
GT-Scan). Cas-OFFinder (Bae et £11., 2014) is also designed
speciﬁcally for CRISPR/Cas systems, does not allow user-
speciﬁed rules and requires the user to specify the candidate
targets. Cas-OT Oﬁao et £11., 2014) cannot currently be run Via
the web.

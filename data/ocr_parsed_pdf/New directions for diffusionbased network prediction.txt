ABSTRACT

Motivation: It has long been hypothesized that incorporating models
of network noise as well as edge directions and known pathway in-
formation into the representation of protein—protein interaction (PPI)
networks might improve their utility for functional inference.
However, a simple way to do this has not been obvious. We find
that diffusion state distance (DSD), our recent diffusion-based metric
for measuring dissimilarity in PPI networks, has natural extensions that
incorporate confidence, directions and can even express coherent
pathways by calculating DSD on an augmented graph.

Results: We define three incremental versions of DSD which we term
cDSD, caDSD and capDSD, where the capDSD matrix incorporates
confidence, known directed edges, and pathways into the measure of
how similar each pair of nodes is according to the structure of the PPI
network. We test four popular function prediction methods (majority
vote, weighted majority vote, multi-way cut and functional flow) using
these different matrices on the Baker’s yeast PPI network in cross-
validation. The best performing method is weighted majority vote
using capDSD. We then test the performance of our augmented
DSD methods on an integrated heterogeneous set of protein associ-
ation edges from the STRING database. The superior performance of
capDSD in this context confirms that treating the pathways as prob-
abilistic units is more powerful than simply incorporating pathway
edges independently into the network.

tracting pathway information from KEGG XML files, and for calculating

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the most well—studied problems in computational network
biology is the prediction of protein functional labels from dis—
tance and neighborhood structure in the proteiniprotein inter—
action network (PPI network). In 2013, based on the observation
that paths through high—degree ‘hub’ nodes in the PPI network
were less informative than short paths through protein nodes
with fewer interaction partners, (Cao et al., 2013) introduce the
diffusion state distance (DSD) metric that is able to quantify
topological similarity in a PPI network in a more fine—grained
way. Diffusion—based methods had been previously proposed for
clustering similar proteins (Voevodski et al., 2009) and for

ranking candidate disease genes (Chen et al., 2009; Erten et a].
2011; Kohler et al., 2008; Vanunu et al., 2010), but by explicitly
taking an L1 norm of the vector of the random walks to all other
nodes in the network to measure the distance between nodes,
DSD is able to capture a more global view of the network
than other prior work we are aware of, with the exception of
Vavien (Erten et a]. 2011) for candidate disease gene ranking,
and ISORANK—N (Liao et al., 2009), which also is based on a
global embedding, but for a very different problem (network
alignment).

Cao et a]. (2013) showed that when a DSD—based distance is
substituted for ordinary next—hop shortest—path distance in four
classical network—based function prediction methods, functional
label prediction performance for the GO (Gene Ontology), as
well as all three levels of the MIPS (Munich Information
Center For Protein Sequences) ontology, improved across
the board in cross—validation experiments on both the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Spam/76 PPI networks.
However, these results were based only on a simple undirected
model of the PPI network, which additionally assumed that all
the edges listed in the BioGRID data were uniformly correct.

On the other hand, it is well—established both that there is noise
in the PPI interaction network data (Mering et al., 2002; Reguly
et (11., 2006; Gandhi et al., 2006), and that some interactions are
naturally directed in the PPI network (Liu et al., 2009; Gitter
et al., 2011; Du et al., 2012). In addition, lookingjust at pairwise
interaction data as edges does not fully capture all the informa—
tion that is known about the PPI network. In particular, there is
increasingly available data on biological pathways, for example,
TGF—ﬂ binds TGF—ﬂ receptor 1, which phosphorylates Smad3,
which with importin—ﬂl enters the nucleus and binds DNA to
regulate expression (Moustakas 2002).

In this article, we revisit the DSD metric we designed in earlier
work for function prediction in the ordinary undirected PPI net—
work. We find that its diffusion—based framework gives a natural
way to incorporate edge confidences and directed edges (when
known). However, the main contribution of this article is to
show that there is a way to capture the cohesiveness of known
pathways by calculating DSD on an augmented network, and
that this way of representing pathways results in better perform—
ance than just incorporating the pathway edges themselves for
most, but not all of the function prediction methods we study.
We show this ﬁrst in cross—validation on the standard network
consisting of just experimentally verified physical interaction
edges from S.cerevisiae, and then on an integrative network
with heterogeneous protein association data edges derived from
the STRING database (Franceschini et al., 2013).

1.1 Overview of DSD

PPI networks are known to be ‘small world’ networks in the
sense that they are small—diameter, and most nodes are close to
all other nodes. Thus any method that infers similarity based on
proximity will ﬁnd that a large fraction of the network is prox—
imate to any typical node. In fact, this issue has already been
termed the ‘ties in proximity’ problem in the computational biol—
ogy literature (Arnau et al., 2005).

Furthermore, the fact that two particular nodes are adjacent
(i.e., have shortest—path distance 1) in a PPI network can signify
something very different than the adjacency of two other nodes.
For example, in PPI networks two nodes with many low—degree
neighbors in common should be thought of as ‘more similar’
than nodes with few low—degree neighbors in common; and
such nodes should also be thought of as ‘more similar’ than
two nodes whose common neighbors have high—degree. Thus,
characterizing node pairs based only on a shortest—path notion
of distance fails to capture important knowledge encoded in the
structure of the network.

In (Cao et al., 2013), DSD is defined on an undirected
connected simple graph. In particular, our PPI network is
deﬁned with a vertex set V, containing a node for each veriﬁed
ORF, and an edge set E, containing an unweighted and undir—
ected edge for each physical interaction. We ﬁrst calculate
He{/‘}(A,B) as the expected number of times that a random
walk starting at node A and proceeding for k steps, will visit
node B; then we further deﬁne a n—dimensional vector
He{k}(v,~), Vv,~ e V, where

He{k}(v,~) = (He{k)(v,~, v1), He{k)(v,~, v2), ..., He{k}(v,~, v,,)).

In what follows, the k—step DSD between two vertices u and v,
Vu, v e V is defined as

DSDW. v) = “He/“(24> — He{k’(v>lll,

where ||He{k}(u)— He{k}(v)||1 denotes the L1 norm of the He
vectors of u and v. As proved in (Cao et al., 2013), on the
simple connected graph whose random walk one—step transition
probability matrix is diagonalizable and ergodic as a Markov
chain, the limit of DSD when k approaches inﬁnity exists and
can be calculated as

llim DSD{k’(u, v) = “(M — b,T)(1_ P+ 0*th

where I is the identity matrix, C is the constant matrix in which
each row is a copy of TIT, JTT is the unique steady state distribu—
tion, and for any i e V, [if is the i—th basis vector, that is, the
row vector of all zeros except for a l in the i—th position, and
P= {p[/}Z/=0 is the n—dimensional one—step transition probability
matrix where the (i, j)th entry is given by

1
— if v~, v4 e E
PU: “I” ( I J) 7
0 otherwise
where d,- is the degree of node v,. In this work, we use the con—

verged DSD values as the original DSD calculation for
comparison.

1.2 New directions

In the ﬁrst DSD paper, we modiﬁed four classical function pre—
diction methods (including Neighborhood Majority Vote
(Schwikowski et al., 2000), X2 Neighborhood (Hishigaki et al.,
2001), Multi—way Cut (Vazquez et al., 2003) and Functional
Flow (Nabieva et al., 2005)) to use this dissimilarity metric
rather than next—hop shortest—path distance as a dissimilarity
metric, and showed that performance improved across the
board. Now we extend the calculation of DSD to incorporate
conﬁdence, then conﬁdence and directed and undirected path—
way edges, then confidence, pathway edges and full biological
pathways. We present three new dissimilarity measures, which
we call cDSD, caDSD or capDSD, respectively, where capDSD
stands for conﬁdence, augmented pathway diffusion state distance.
These measures can be substituted for original DSD in the four
classical function prediction methods we studied (or in any func—
tional prediction method that incorporates a pairwise dissimilar—
ity measure between nodes).

First, to define cDSD, similar to the approach suggested by
Gitter et a]. (2011), we assign a conﬁdence to each PPI inter—
action edge in BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006), based on the
number of publications in which that PPI appears, and whether
the reported experiments are high—throughput or low—through—
put. Given the formal definition of DSD, there is a natural way
to incorporate these conﬁdences simply as edge weights, and the
k—step DSD calculation is generalized to a weighted matrix in the
natural way (see Section 2.1.3 for full details). We show that
incorporating conﬁdence values in this way improves perform—
ance over the basic DSD method (which in turn improved the
performance compared to the corresponding method based on
shortest—path distances (Cao et al., 2013)) in cross—validation on
each of the classical network—based function prediction methods
we consider.

On top of the conﬁdence values, we then seek to augment the
network by adding edges from the KEGG PATHWAY database
in two ways. We ﬁnd that 2471 of these edges are not already in
BioGRID, and an additional 177 are in BioGRID, but we would
have assigned them lower conﬁdence without the additional in—
formation that they also appeared in KEGG, so it is not surpris—
ing that adding in these edges improves our results as compared
to DSD and cDSD. In the ﬁrst and simplest way, which we call
caDSD, we augment the graph by adding undirected and dir—
ected edges from the KEGG database; where edges of the types:
activation, inhibition, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation and
ubiquination are considered naturally directed as in (Liu et al.,
2009) and all other KEGG edges are considered undirected
(however, an undirected edge being included in the KEGG data—
base raises its edge weight because KEGG is manually curated).
However, we also create capDSD which creates an augmented
graph that represents the signaling pathways coherently using
new sets of nodes and edges. In this new augmented graph, path—
ways can be thought of as being represented by ‘controlled—
access highways’, in the sense that once the diffusion random
walk enters a pathway, it stays on that pathway with some
fixed probability r and only leaves that pathway to walk in the
regular PPI network (still augmented with directed edges, where
known, and conﬁdence) with probability 17 r, where the ﬁxed r is
a parameter of the method. Just like DSD, capDSD is not a

matter so little on the BioGRID experiment, see Table 3). The resulting
graph Gm is undirected, connected, has diameter 5, and contains 5058
nodes and 404 358 edges.

2.1.3 PPI confidence assignment Because there is no conﬁdence
score provided by BioGRID, we create conﬁdence weights for
BioGRID PPI edges in Go using a scoring scheme similar to previous
work by (Gitter et al., 2011), according to the following premises:

0 Low-throughput experiments, due to their lower false positive rate,
are considered to provide more reliable PPIs than high-throughput
experiments.

0 If a PPI is veriﬁed experimentally by more experiments from curated
publications, we hold higher conﬁdence in the existence of the PPI.

There are more than 7000 publications associated with the physical inter-
action PPI data we collect from BioGRID, making a manual assignment
of whether the experiment supporting the PPI is high- or low-throughput
highly impractical. Instead, we automatically and efﬁciently determine a
close proxy for this information by simply counting the number of differ-
ent PPIs that a particular publication vouches for in BioGRID. If there
are at least 100 PPIs associated with a particular publication, we classify
that publication’s endorsements as high-throughput and otherwise low-
throughput. In total, 7112 publications are classified as low-throughput
and 97 publications are classiﬁed as high-throughput. Note that these 97
high-throughput publications actually generate more than two-thirds of
the physical interactions. (We tried other cutoff values for distinguishing
low-throughput/high-throughput and the results were similar; in fact,
very few publications lie close to the 100 threshold; most low-throughput
publications have substantially less, and most high-throughput publica-
tions have substantially more.) If an interaction edge is endorsed by only
experiments of one type (either high- or low-throughput) we assign con-
ﬁdence weights according to Table 1. If an interaction edge is endorsed by
both high conﬁdence and low conﬁdence experiments, we use the conﬁ-
dence score from the low-throughput column in Table 1 plus 5% times
the number of high-throughput endorsements; however, if this value
exceeds 95%, we still assign a maximum confidence score of 95%.

For all pairs of nodes in Go, we can assign the conﬁdence score as their
weight. We denote by Wmnf = {my-HF] the weight matrix, where w,-,~ is the
conﬁdence score for the node pair (v,, v,) (also denoted as ww-W/ when
confusion does not exist). Note that wa- = 0, V(v,, vj) gé E0 and
w,»j>0, V(v,, vj) e E0. We denote by Gmnf( Vconf, Econf, Wmnf) this simple
undirected graph where Vconf = V0, Econf = E) and Wconf is deﬁned
above.

For the edge weights in Gm we simply take the conﬁdence scores [71, p2
and 173 from STRING for each selected category: ‘experiments’,
‘co-expression’ and ‘database’ (Note that we assign 0.9 for ‘database’
conﬁdence score if the association link is in the KEGG PATHWAY
PPIs, and 0 otherwise; the choice of 0.9 for KEGG PPIs is
similar to STRING’s.); then we calculate the combined conﬁdence
score as p=1 — (1 —p1)>x<(l —p2)>x<(l —p3) in the Bayesian scheme,
which is exactly how STRING (Franceschini et al., 2013) suggests indi-
vidual conﬁdence scores be combined.

2.1.4 Functional pathway maps We use all 105 Scerevisiae signaling
pathways from the KEGG PATHWAY database (Kanehisa and Goto,
2000) (version date: December 12, 2013) where there are 75 pathways from
the metabolism category, 21 from the genetic information processing cat-
egory, 3 from the environmental information processing category and 6
from the cellular processes category. Just as suggested in (Liu et al., 2009),
in the BioGRID experiments, we run both caDSD with all edges undir-
ected, and we also run the version of caDSD where we additionally con-
sider the following ﬁve protein relations that appear in the KEGG
database as directional: activation, inhibition, phosphorylation, depho-
sphorylation and ubiquination. Any PPIs extracted with only one of

these ﬁve types are considered directed, while all the other PPIs annotated
with types such as ‘compound’ are considered undirected. In total, there
are 206 directed PPIs and 6951 undirected PPIs separately, involving 1120
proteins in the KEGG PATHWAY database; since we only consider edges
of which both endpoints appear in the connected PPI network Go, we
extract 157 directed PPIs, the set of which is denoted by D, and 3374
undirected PPIs, the set of which is denoted by U, involving 1083 unique
ORFs total. Because the results for the caDSD adding so few directed
edges were very similar to the fully undirected version of caDSD, we do
not add directions to the edges in the STRING experiment.

2.1.5 Functional annotation We consider both the MIPS functional
catalogue (FunCat) (Ruepp et al., 2004) and GO annotations (Ashburner
et al., 2000). We use the latest version of FunCat (version 2.1) and the
ﬁrst, second and third level functional categories, retaining only those
labels annotating at least three proteins in our dataset. We present results
for MIPS annotations at the ﬁrst level (4443 proteins with 10 569 anno-
tations in 17 functional categories in BioGRID), second level (4428 pro-
teins with 12 378 annotations in 74 out of 80 functional categories
annotating at least 3 proteins in BioGRID) and third level (4061 proteins
with 9441 annotations in 154 out of 181 functional categories annotating
at least 3 proteins in BioGRID). We also present results for the popular
GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), where the variable depth hierarchy of the
annotation labels makes the evaluation of predicted labels more compli-
cated, in the Supplementary Material.

2.2 cDSD, caDSD and capDSD

2.2.1 cDSD.’ incorporating PPI confidence We build the undir-
ected weighted simple graph Gconj( Vconf,Econf, Wconf) where Vconf = V0
and Econf = E) are simply deﬁned by assigning the conﬁdence score to
all pairs of nodes in V0. The conﬁdence scores are assigned as described in
Section 2.1.3. Let P’ = {pl’j}:’j:0 be the n-dimensional one-step transition
matrix where the (i, j)th entry is given by

W [j

n
/_ E w»
1717* [=1 ’1

otherwise

Note that P, represents the probability to reach each neighbor in the
random walk. Then the definition of k-step transition probability
matrix P’{k}=P’k follows for all positive k. It is easy to show that
the expected number of times that a random walk starting at node v,-

and proceeding for k steps will visit node v), denoted as He’mm, vj),

we ﬁx the number of random walk steps k, the deﬁnition of DSD with

New directions for network-based protein function prediction

 

2.2.2 caDSD: adding KEGG PPIs We consider PPIs from KEGG
PATHWAY database highly reliable since they are manually drawn by
domain experts; for the BioGRID experiments, we will re-assign max-
imum conﬁdence score 1 to these PPIs no matter whether or not the PPI
is present in the BioGRID database (For the STRING experiments, note
that every KEGG edge is already assigned a conﬁdence value of at least
0.9 by cDSD (and maybe larger if there is additional independent evi-
dence) so we just retain cDSD conﬁdence values on these edges).

Thus, based on the undirected graph Gmnf( anf, Econf, Wmnf), the un-
directed edge set U and the directed edge set D from KEGG pathways,
we build a directed graph Gaug(Vdug, Eaug, Wang), where Vang: V0, E4dug
and W4dug ={wl1‘ug} " are constructed as follows (we use () to denote

11 [3:0
directed edges compared to () for undirected edges):

weight 1; and

(3) For each edge (v,, vj) e D, if (v,,v,~) already exists in Econf, set

2.2.3 capDSD: the augmented graph with explicit pathways The
previous caDSD makes use of the fact that the PPIs from the KEGG
PATHWAY database are high-quality, and sometimes known to be dir-
ectional; however it incorporates the KEGG pathway information as
individual interaction edges and retains no notion of each pathway as a
cohesive whole. In particular, some graph paths may not be meaningful
at all when mapped to a chain of ORFs, while other graph paths corres-
pond to signaling pathways. We hypothesize that if we can make the
random walks used to calculate DSD values hew more tightly to the
known pathways, the resulting diffusion process might better capture
the notion of functional similarity. However, doing so directly would
destroy the ‘memoryless’ structure of the underlying random walk, and
make the probabilities too difﬁcult to calculate. Our solution is to instead
build a new network, where nodes in pathways are replicated, into ordin-
ary and ‘highway’ versions, where the ‘highway’ version is chosen with
some probability, and if the ‘highway’ is taken, edge probabilities for the
highway nodes are set so that it is highly likely to continue along the
pathway. More speciﬁcally, we build a network Gpmh(meh, Epmh, meh)
where meh will be a mapping: meh : meh X meh —> R, Va, b e meh
(instead of an n-dimensional square matrix because the size of meh will
be different from n) as follows:

(1) Denote by {P 1, P2, . . . , Pg} where g is the number of pathways, the
set of pathways; denote by PE1,PE2, . . . ,PEg the sets of directed
edges from the g pathways where each undirected edge is

considered as two directed edges; denote by PV1,PV2,...,PVg
the sets of proteins involved in each of the g pathways where
each set is a subset of Vang, namely the ORF list;

(2

V

We initialize meh with {v3}, v3, ...v2} by relabeling each ORF node
v, e V4dug with a superscript 0, which stands for the original PPI
network; we initialize Wm“, as the empty map;

(3) We initialize Emu, by adding (v?, v?) with weight meh(v?, v19):
Wm? for all (v,, vj) e Eaug;

(4 For each pathway Pa 6 {P1, P2,  Pg}:

(b) For each pathway node v? e meh: for each edge
(v,, vj) e Eaug, we add an edge (v‘;, v?) into Epth with weight
wjjdugl; and for each edge (v-, v,) e Eaug, we add an edge (v19, v?)

into Emu1 with weight raj-{laugh these newly added edges are

called cross edges; and

(c

V

For each edge (v,, vj) 6 PE, which we call a pathway edge, add
an edge (v‘ﬁ v3.1) into Epam, and the weight assignment will not
be set but the transition probability will be assigned specially in
Step 7 when all the pathways are processed.

(5) For each cross edge in the form of (villi?) e Epmh,
Vi 6 {1,2, ...,n}, vj e PVa, a e {1, 2, ...,g}, boost the weight by
multiplying meh(v?,vf) by the factor of m and update the

weight with the boosted value, where m is a multiplication factor
parameter;

(6) For all the directed node pairs (V‘f, v15) gé Epmh, Va,
)3 e {0, 1,  g}, v‘}, v]? e meh, assign 0 as the weight since we do
not have any evidence for the existence of the PPI pair (v,, vj);

(7) Let N = |mehl, where N: n -l- 2:] |PVa |. Now we calculate the
N-dimensional one-step transition probability square matrix PM},
where we denote by pm, as the one-step transition probability

from v? to vf,Vv‘}, v]? e meh:

(a) For each pathway node v‘; e meh, where a>0, the pathway

number of pathway edges starting from vf; the cross edge

(v‘;, v?) e Epmh will have transition probability set as pm” = (1

Step 5 is used so that the probability of entering pathways can be
adjusted higher by setting the multiplication factor m> 1; in the Results
section, we report the results where m = 25. Step 7(a) is used so that the
total probability of staying on the same pathway after one transition
from a non-terminal pathway node (the node that has outgoing pathway
edges) will be r, which in our case we set as r = 0.7. We tried different
values for r and m empirically; and results are fairly robust to different
choices of r and m (results of weighted majority voting capDSD over
different choices of r and m appear in the Supplementary Material).
Given the one-step transition probability matrix Ppmh as well as the
l—step transition probability matrix ng‘h =Pémh,Vl : 0, we can calcu-
late the expected number of times that a random walk starting at

The deﬁnition of DSD with external paths follows:

capDSDW(v,, v,) = “Hag,th — Hegih(vj)||1,Vv,, v,- 6 V0.

2.3 Evaluation

As shown in (5), the original DSD improves all the tested classical protein
function prediction algorithms in 2-fold cross-validation for functional
label prediction for all three levels of the MIPS hierarchy by simply
replacing the shortest-path distance with the DSD matrix, where the
best performing method overall was the DSD version of weighted major-
ity vote. In this work, we similarly evaluate four methods (majority vote,
weighted majority vote, multi-way cut and functional ﬂow) using cDSD,
caDSD and capDSD as the distance metric. While the results in (Cao
et al., 2013) were based on the converged DSD as k —> 00, we have not yet
been able to prove convergence for our new cDSd, caDSD and capDSD
variants. Thus, in our experiments, we set the length of random walk step
k = 7 for all the three variants of DSDs (we also tested other values of k
and empirically observed that when k z 5, the performance is almost
unchanged even though we have not been able to prove the convergence
of the variants of DSDs.)

We stress that in each of our experiments, the function prediction
method is unchanged, and does not explicitly incorporate conﬁdence or
pathway information in any way, except in that it uses the values from the
cDSD, caDSD or capDSD matrix instead of from the DSD (or ordinary
shortest-path distance) matrix.

2.3 .1 Cross—validation task We consider 2-fold cross-validation
tasks. In each of the 2-fold cross-validation tasks, we ﬁrst randomly
split the annotated proteins into two sets. For each set, we use its anno-
tations as the training set to predict the annotations on proteins in the
other set. We then average the performance over the 2-folds of the cross-
validation. We conduct 10 runs of 2-fold cross-validation. For MIPS
function prediction we report the means and standard deviations of the
two performance measures over these 10 runs: accuracy and F1 score
(Cao et al., 2013). The accuracy is calculated as the percentage of proteins
that are assigned a correct function annotation (Schwikowski et al.,
2000). The F1 score for each protein function is calculated as (Darnell
et al., 2007)

_ 2 >x< precision >x< recall

F 1 . .
prec1s1on -l- recall

where precision and recall are calculated by looking at the top a (in our
case, we present results for a = 3) predicted annotations. We average F1
scores over the individual functions and obtain the overall F1 score for
each algorithm. Our GO (Ashburner et al., 2000) results take into account
partial matches based on the deep hierarchy of the GO labels according
to the methods of (Deng et al., 2003, 2004) and appear in the
Supplementary Material.

2.3 .2 Neighborhood majority voting algorithm: weighted and
unweighted These are the simplest of all function prediction methods.
Directly applying the concept of ‘guilt by association’, (Schwikowski
et al., 2000) consider for each protein u its neighboring proteins. Each
neighbor votes for their own annotations, and the majority is used as the

predicted functional label. To incorporate DSD, the neighborhood of u is
deﬁned simply as the t nearest neighbors of u under the DSD metric.
Furthermore, two schemes are considered: an unweighted scheme where
all new neighbors vote equally, and a DSD weighted scheme where all
new neighbors get a vote proportional to the reciprocal of their DSD
distance. As in (Cao et al., 2013), we set t = 10.

M ulti—way cut algorithm Similar to (Nabieva et al., 2005), we imple-
ment the minimal multi-way k-cut algorithm of (Vazquez et al., 2003)
whose motivation is to minimize the number of times that annotations
associated with neighboring proteins differ, by approximately solving the
integer linear programming problem:

maximize Z X my,
(u,\')EE,ueFUNC

subject to the constraints ZueFUNCIQM = 1, XE“, 5 X“, XE“, e {0, 1}
, X N, e {0, 1} where the edge variables X “W, are deﬁned for each function
a in the function set FUNC, whenever there exists an edge between pro-
teins u and v in the edge set E. Xuym is set to 1, if protein u and v both are
assigned function a, and 0 otherwise. The node variable X”, are set to 1
when u is labeled with function a and 0 otherwise. The ﬁrst constraint
insures that each protein is only given one annotation. The second con-
straint makes sure only annotations that appear among the vertices can
be assigned to the edges. While this problem is NP-hard, the ILP is
tractable in practice; in our case we use the IBM CPLEX solver (version
12.4, http://www.ilog.com/products/cplex/). For the DSD version of this
algorithm, we simply add additional edges between vertices whose DSD is
below a threshold . We set a global threshold D based on the average
DSD of all pairs, speciﬁcally we set D = u — c >x< a, where u is the average,
and a is the standard deviation of the global set of DSD values among all
pairs of nodes in the graph. As in (Cao et al., 2013), we set c = 1.5.

Functional flow algorithm Nabieva et al. (2005) use a network ﬂow
algorithm on the graph of protein interactions to label proteins. The
idea is to consider each protein having a known function annotation
as a ‘reservoir’ of that function, and to simulate ﬂow of functional
association through the network to make predictions. We adapt the
approach to use DSD by creating an edge between each node pair,
with a weight inversely proportional to DSD. For computational efﬁ-
ciency we do not create edges when the reciprocal of DSD is below a
small value. This global threshold for DSD values is set the same as in
the multi-way cut algorithm. As in the original functional ﬂow, we
calculate ﬂow through this new network at each time step. We denote
the size of the reservoir of function a at node u and time step i, to be
Rﬂu). For a given function (annotation) a we initialize the reservoir
size at node u to be inﬁnite if protein u has been annotated with
function a; otherwise we set it to be 0. More formally: R3(u)=oo if
u is annotated with a and 0 otherwise. We then update the reservoir
over a sequence of time steps (we use six time steps, as in the original
version (Nabieva et al., 2005)):

Rr(u)=R::1(u)+ Z chum—grow».

v:(u,v)eE

where g‘f(v, u) is the amount of ﬂow a that moves from u to v at time
t. We incorporate DSD into the edge weight as follows:

0, ifR‘f71(u)<R‘f71(v)
u, V
g“ ) mimm , ﬂow“) otherwise.
I
where ﬂow", = 050"” . The ﬁnal functional score for node u and

“LIKED—SD07”

function a is computed as the total amount of incoming ﬂow.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Performance of function prediction methods and
their DSD variants on MIPS

Cao et al. (2013) show how to modify several classical function
prediction methods, including the four we study here (majority
vote, weighted majority vote, multi—way cut and functional flow)
to utilize the DSD pairwise dissimilarity metric in place of or—
dinary shortest—path distance. In this work, we use the same
DSD—based methods as in Cao et al. (2013), but instead substi—
tute the cDSD, caDSD and capDSD matrices to incorporate
conﬁdence measures and pathways. Full MIPS results on
BioGRID data appear in Table 2, where we have two versions
of caDSD: one that adds directions to the 157 edges which are of
the ﬁve types identiﬁed by Gitter et al. (2011) as naturally dir—
ected, and one where all edges are left undirected. Table 3 then
gives the results on the integrative STRING database. Note that
for the STRING database, we already include all the KEGG
edges, so cDSD is equivalent to (undirected) caDSD, so this
merges the two lines in the table. GO results appear in the
Supplementary Material.

We observe that, on both BioGRID and STRING, over 10
runs of 2—fold cross—validation, the best method overall is
weighted majority vote with capDSD. For example, weighted
majority vote with capDSD achieves an average 68.90% accur—
acy and 51.61% Fl score on the ﬁrst level of the MIPS hierarchy
on BioGRID, and an average 71.30% accuracy and 52.91% Fl

score on the first level of the MIPS hierarchy using STRING.
Several other observations are interesting. On the BioGRID
data, substituting original DSD for the ordinary shortest—paths
metric improved all the function prediction methods we tested
across the board. On STRING, this was not the case: when
additional edges such as co—expression were added in, ordinary
DSD (without conﬁdence weights) no longer improved the clas—
sical function prediction methods we tested with the exception of
functional ﬂow, where there was a large improvement. But func—
tional ﬂow did much worse overall on the STRING database
compared to BioGRID. This implies that when adding in add—
itional edges from sources that might be more weakly correlated
to functional transfer of annotation, it is crucial to include con—
ﬁdence values. Once we go from unweighted DSD to DSD with
conﬁdence, we again see improvements over classical methods.
Going from unweighted DSD to cDSD improves everything, but
it is even more crucial for STRING than for BioGRID to include
a conﬁdence measure.

Now let us consider all the different ways to incorporate high—
conﬁdence KEGG edges. In the BioGRID experiments, as re—
marked above, it is not surprising that caDSD and capDSD,
which use these edges perform better than cDSD, since not all
these edges appear already in BioGRID. In the STRING experi—
ment, these edges are already present in cDSD, so cDSD = caDSD
gives the naive way to put in these edges, whereas capDSD puts
them in as augmented pathways. In the BioGRID experiments, we
also experimentally tried assigning directions to some of the

Note: Weighted majority vote with capDSD (in bold) gives the best results over all three levels of the MIPS hierarchy.

KEGG edges as well, as in the method of Gitter et al. (2011) (see
Methods section). However, we find that directing 157 edges is
much too small a number to affect results; as can be seen in Table
2, results are nearly identical to the undirected caDSD. We there—
fore used only undirected caDSD which is the same as cDSD for
the STRING experiments.

So it remains to answer the main question of the article,
whether using the augmented pathways as controlled—access
highways is a better way to incorporate pathway information
than just using individual edges. The best performing method,
weighted majority vote, improved things only very slightly (by
<171.5 pp) for BioGRID, on different levels of the MIPS hier—
archy, with more improvement at the lower levels of the hier—
archy. However, on STRING, with the presence of more edges
that were more weakly correlated to function, the improvement
is much greater. In the STRING experiments (Table 3), going to
pathways (capDSD) improved weighted majority vote by over
1.5 pp on the first level of the MIPS hierarchy, by over 3 pp on
the second level of the MIPS hierarchy and by over 4 pp on the
third level of the MIPS hierarchy. Similar improvements are seen
for capDSD with unweighted majority vote and functional ﬂow
on STRING, though these are not the best performing methods
overall, while performance of multi—way cut degrades with aug—
mented pathways. We next discuss why that might be the case.

4 DISCUSSION

Incorporating conﬁdence and pathways into our diffusion—based
distance metric DSD, we studied whether it was best to incorp—
orate pathway information as edges or as controlled—access high—
ways in an augmented graph. We showed that the augmented
graph improved the best function prediction method we tested,
weighted majority vote, especially in our experiments on the
STRING database, where there were additional edges whose
correlation with function was weaker. The performance of

other methods was not as clearly served by the augmented path—
ways; capDSD improved functional ﬂow in the noisier STRING
setting, but not on BioGRID. The performance of multi—way cut
degraded across the board. We hypothesize that the methods
that will improve using capDSD versus just caDSD are those
that use only some sort of information about the local neighbor—
hood of a node to predict its function; here, making path—
ways ‘closer’ with highways is helpful, whereas the amount of
distortion in augmenting the graph causes too much noise for
more global methods such as multi—way cut. Functional ﬂow, has
both local and global aspects, so its mixed performance would be
consistent with this theory.

Finally, the best modern function prediction methods are all
integrative methods, and may do something more sophisticated
than adding in data from other high—throughput data sources as
edges with different confidences (Sharan et al., 2005, 2007;
Borgwardt et al., 2005; Cozzetto et al., 2013; Dutkowski et al.,
2013). Thus the next step would be to integrate our results into a
hybrid method along these lines.

We note that all code for calculating the conﬁdences, for ex—
tracting pathway information from KEGG XML ﬁles, and for
calculating the cDSD, caDSD and capDSD matrices is available
from http://dsd.cs.tufts.edu/capdsd.

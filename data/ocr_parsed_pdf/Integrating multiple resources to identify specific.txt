ABSTRACT

Motivation: Limited cohort of transcription factors is capable to struc-
ture various gene-expression patterns. Transcriptional cooperativity
(T C) is deemed to be the main mechanism of complexity and precision
in regulatory programs. Although many data types generated from
numerous experimental technologies are utilized in an attempt to
understand combinational transcriptional regulation, complementary
computational approach that can integrate diverse data resources
and assimilate them into biological model is still under development.
Results: We developed a novel Bayesian approach for integrative
analysis of proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic data to identify
specific TO. The model evaluation demonstrated distinguishable
power of features derived from distinct data sources and their essen-
tiality to model performance. Our model outperformed other classifiers
and alternative methods. The application that contextualized TC within
hepatocarcinogenesis revealed carcinoma associated alterations.
Derived TC networks were highly significant in capturing validated
cooperativity as well as revealing novel ones. Our methodology is
the first multiple data integration approach to predict dynamic
nature of TC. It is promising in identifying tissue- or disease-specific
TC and can further facilitate the interpretation of underlying mechan-
isms for various physiological conditions.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the human genome, genes manifest dramatic diversity in terms
of expression levels and tissue- or condition-speciﬁc expression
patterns. Despite this tremendous diversity, all genes are con-
trolled by numbered transcription factors (TFs). TFs can work
as monomers, homodimers and heterodimers to facilitate (as an
activator) or inhibit (as a repressor) the recruitment of RNA
polymerase and display high speciﬁcity in ligand activation
thereby precisely controlling the condition-dependent expression
of target genes (TGs) (Bookout et al., 2006; Latchman, 1997). TF
activity and interaction is characterized of condition-dependence
and transience. Such mutual regulation among TFs underlies
major features of cellular identity and complex functions such
as pluripotency (Kim et al., 2008), development (Lagha et al.,

2012) and differentiation (Braun and Gautel, 2011; Fei and
Chen, 2010) even diseases (Hoffmeyer et al., 2012), which
makes the study of transcriptional cooperativity (TC) of para-
mount importantance.

The development of numerous experimental technologies
including whole-genome sequencing, large-scale expression pro-
ﬁling, yeast two-hybrid experiments and emerging chromatin
immunoprecipitation makes it possible to understand the com-
binational transcriptional regulation from various perspectives.
Biologically relevant synergistic interactions between different
TFs are discovered in yeast by insight into gene expression
data (Banerjee and Zhang, 2003). Proteiniprotein interaction
(PPI) data is also used to infer synergistic binding of cooperative
TFs (Nagamine et al., 2005). Another study that can indicate the
interactions between TFs is based on the genome sequence H u
et al., 2006a. b). More recently, the ENCODE Consortium
provides comprehensive Chromatin immunoprecipitation
coupled with high-throughput sequencing data for reliable View
of TF-binding—site interaction (Gerstein et al., 2012; Wang et al.,
2012; Whitﬁeld et al., 2012).

Previous studies on the investigation of TC are reasonable in
assumptions or biology. Many TFs bind DNA preferentially at
characteristic sequence motifs, thereby providing the sequence
speciﬁcity required to reﬂect the possible spatial relationships
between TFs in terms of preferences in distance and orientation
(Lemon and Tjian, 2000). The interaction between two proteins
indicates they contribute to the same or similar biological pro-
cesses (Nagamine et al., 2005). The gene proﬁles reveal the simi-
larity between gene expressions, which could be used to infer
synergistic relationships between TFs when their common TGs
show highly correlated expression patterns (Pilpel et al., 2001; Yu
et al., 2003). Although previous studies have made encouraging
progress, the investigation of TC encounters four major chal-
lenges: (i) the time consumption and high costs of valid experi-
ments; (ii) the vast majority of TFs not being experimentally
proﬁled genome wide; (iii) the difﬁculty of interrogating the activ-
ities of multiple TFs within the same cellular environment; (iv)
mainly focusing on static or global interaction but ignoring the
dynamic nature of TC. All of these have underscored the need to
integrate various data and construct a complementary computa-
tional approach that can assimilate them into biological models.

The TC deﬁned in this article broadly means the functional
interaction between different DNA-binding TFs in regulation of
gene expression. It could be physical, genetic or regulatory inter-
action between TFs, competitive or synergetic co-regulation.
Furthermore, TF homodimer interactions and interactions

between TFs and non-DNA-binding cofactors as well as coop-
erativity among multiple TFs are not within our research
emphasis.

In this article, we proposed a novel algorithm based on
Bayesian theory for integrative analysis of diverse large-scale
biological data to identify TC. Our strategy is based on hypoth-
esis that cooperative TF pairs share shorter distance in PPI net-
work, closer spatial relationship on promoter regions, stronger
distance constraint among binding sites and higher correlation
on gene expression pattern. We derived four features and tested
their discrimination based on HepG2 golden standard dataset.
Benchmark analyses were implemented for the assessment of
model performance compared with individual feature and
straight Logistic regression as well as one-feature-removed
Bayesian model. Furthermore, we performed comparison with
other existing methods. Bayesian approach was then applied
to contextualize TC within hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
progression.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data sources

Our study started with the collection of informative data resources, which
include PPI data, position weighted matrices (PWMs), TFiTG regulatory
relationships and gene-expression data of speciﬁc tissue—disease. The PPI
data used to calculate PPI score are publicly available from HPRD
(Prasad et al., 2009). The PWMs were obtained from TRANSFAC
(Matys et al., 2003), JASPAR (Bryne et al., 2008) and researches on
ENCODE data (Wang et al., 2012). Promoter sequence set was built
by extracting sequences 1000 bases upstream of annotated transcription
starts of RefSeq genes with annotated 5’ UTRs from Human genome
sequence (hg19). TFiTG regulatory relationships were collected from
three distinct databases: TRED (Jiang et al., 2007), InnateDB (Lynn
et al., 2008) and HTRIdb (Bovolenta et al., 2012). We used microarray
data of human liver cell line (HepG2) induced by PCB153 (GSE6494) for
feature and model evaluation, neuroblastomas SKiNisH cells induced
by retinoic acid (GSE9169) for method comparison and gene proﬁles
during HCC progression (GSE25097) for application.

2.2 The PPI score

First, we constructed a PPI network based on non-redundant PPI data
from HPRD that consists of 39240 PPIs involving 9673 proteins. Then,
extended CzekanowskiiDice distance was used to calculate the distances
between proteins (Brun et al., 2004). It can express diversity and speciﬁ-
city of distances between proteins adequately. For the proteins A and B
with the range I, D(A, B, I) was deﬁned as follows:

 

 

l l l
2 ;(l1ntk(A)l + lIntk(B)l) — 2 2 2 min lIntm(A) n Intn(B)l
D(A,B,!) :k:1 n:lm:l -

éiillmkwﬁ + lIntk(B)l)

(1)

Where Intk(A) is a list of proteins whose minimum number of edges
needed to reach protein A is equal to k (to decrease the distance between
proteins interacting with each other, Intk(A) includes the protein A itself).
D(A, B, I) is equal to CzekanowskiiDice distance.

Finally, the PPI score as a measurement of cooperativity between
proteins was deﬁned as follows:

PPI Score = mlin D(A,B, l), [in {1, 2}. (2)

2.3 Genome-wide search for PWM

Seven hundred and seventy-four unique PWMs united from
TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2003), JASPAR (Bryne et al., 2008) and
researches on ENCODE data (Wang et al., 2012) were imposed with
genome-wide search for their binding occurrence and sites (the schematic
is shown in Supplementary Figure Sl). We performed PWM scan under
the assistance of BSgenome package and only considered TF binding in
promoter region that was deﬁned as 1000 bases upstream from transcrip-
tional start site (TSS). The minimum match score was set to 95%.
Although some regulatory elements can act over large distances, up to
several kilobases from TSS, we focused on sequences in the relative prox-
imity of TSS as they are most likely to contain regulatory information
for latent spatial relationships between TFs. Totally, there are ~4.8 mil-
lion hits in non-repetitive promoter regions, which correspond to ~6200
hits for each PWM.

2.4 Co-occurrence score

Co-occurrence score evaluates the over-representation of TF pair occur-
rence in the promoters of common TGs regulated by two TFs compared
to its occurrence in all promoters in human genome. It was calculated
according to:

_ G k 1 k _1 H
Co — occurrence score _ g ( G ) (N) (1 N) (3)

where n is the number of the promoters of common TGs regulated by two
TFs; N is the total number of human promoters; g is the occurrence of TF
pair in the promoters of common TGs regulated by two TFs; and G is the
overall occurrence of TF pair in promoters of entire human genome. The
equation was used to obtain the probability of observing the TF pair g or
more times in the n promoters of common TGs regulated by two TFs, given
that the TF pair occurs G times in total N promoters. It is notable that some
TFs have multiple binding sites in one promoter. In such cases, when
calculating g and G we counted all combinations between the TF binding
sites. Other researchers reported that counting all possible pairs yielded
better performance than regarding these cases as a single binding-site pair
occurrence (Yu et al., 2006a, b). Note that one TF pair may correspond
with several PWM pairs since one TF may have more than one PWM, so
the co-occurrence score was taken as the minimum among them.

2.5 Distance constraint score

The distance constraint between binding sites of one TF pair in promoter
regions was measured by comparing the observed distance distribution
fobv(d) with a background distribution f (d) using the Kolmogorovi
Smirnov test. For each TF pair, distances between their binding sites were
calculated. If one or both TFs own multiple binding sites in one promoter,
we included the distances between all combinations as we did for co-occur-
rence score. The background distribution f (d) was obtained by considering
binding sites of TF pair occur randomly on promoters and measuring the
distances between them (in unit of bp). It can be normalized as:

L — Wu — w}, — d+l
Zi’lwrwbﬂ (L — Wu — w}, — i+ l)

I:

fL(d) = (4)
where L is the length of one promoter sequence; Wu and w}, are the widths of
the binding sites of TF,, and TFb; d is the binding site distance; and
L — w“ — wb — d + 1 means the number of all possible arrangements for
the binding site pair. The background distribution fL(d) varies depending
on different promoter sequence length L. In our approach, L was 1000 bp.

2.6 Co-expression

For a given TF pair, assume there are m (m32) common genes shared by
both. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) based on gene-expression

proﬁles was calculated for each of the M = C3, pairs of genes. PCC was
applied with Fisher transformation to obtain co-expression r for the fol-

lowing analysis:

2.7 Bayesian model

For each TF pair, we separated data resources into two parts: prior in-
formation and context-speciﬁc data. PPI, co-occurrence and distance
constraint were considered as prior information that is independent of
the cell type or physical condition and were integrated together through
Logistic model as prior probability :1 that reﬂects the general propensity
of cooperativity.

Due to the possibility of numerical underﬂow from very small probabil-
ities, we made use of natural logarithm for co-occurrence score and
distance constraint score.

The overall model shown schematically in Figure 1 was based on
Bayesian theory

_ P(I=1)>1<P(r|I= 1)

[7 (7)
where [7 represents the probability of combinational cooperativity
given the prior information and speciﬁc gene proﬁling. Prior probability
that a TF pair is cooperative was termed as n=P(I=1). Here 1711
= P(I= 0) was analogous to representing one TF pair is not cooperative.
Co-expression r was assumed to be generated from one of two underlying
distributions. One relates to the cooperative state of TF pair (r|I = 1),
while the other distribution corresponds to the uncooperative state

(r|I = 0). Co-expression r can be modelled with normal distribution as:
’11 =1~ NUMJ’? fl]: 0 ~ N(lt2,0§)- (8)

Distributions for cooperative state and uncooperative state were
designated with parameters 11.1, a] and 11.2, 02.

2.8 Parameter estimation and model computation

The parameters of the Bayesian model ,80, ,8], ,82, ,83, 11.1, a], 11.2, 02 were
estimated by maximizing the likelihood function using expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm used in our model
is robust and fast on convergence as long as proper initial parameters

are selected. We initialized the parameters with the utilization of PPI
data. Although PPI is constituent of prior information, it still contributes
to an informed starting point. Detailed implementation of EM algorithm
is as follows.

Step 1: Based on PPI information, extract TF pairs from the qualiﬁed
TF pairs and label them with ‘co-operative’. Randomly sampled
equal-sized TF pairs from the rests and label them with ‘non-
co-operative’.

Step 2: Utilize the dataset constructed in Step 1 to ﬁt ,B’s in Logistic
model and M’s, 0’s of normal distributions.

Step 3: Calculate the expected [7 based on parameters estimated in
Step 2.

Step 4: Maximize the likelihood function to obtain all the parameters
and update the initial values with the new estimations.

Step 5: Repeat regular EM steps until convergence.

The criteria for convergence are: (i) the likelihood of the model changes
by 0.001 and (ii) all the parameters change by 0.001 with respect to the
previous EM iteration.

2.9 Golden standard dataset ofT C in HepG2

Utilizing domain-based interaction data (Miyamoto-Sato et al., 2010)
and TF-to-TF regulatory interactions speciﬁc in HepG2 (Neph et al.,
2012), we conﬁrmed 68 TF pairs validated by experiments and hepato-
blastoma-speciﬁc (HepG2) to form the golden positive dataset. Since the
majority of TC remains undiscovered to date, it is difﬁcult to derive a
reasonable golden negative dataset. In this article, we used three rules to
identify the negatives: (i) the TF pairs are not physical interacted; (ii) TFs
are not speciﬁcally interacted in HepG2; and (iii) TF pairs cannot share
identical gene ontology (GO) terms on cellular component considering
TF pairs who function in different components would not be interacted.
Based on these criteria, 428 TF pairs were left to form the golden negative
dataset.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Feature construction and discrimination

We derived features from various data sources and based on
reasonable biological assumptions. The PPI score based on
extended CzekanowskiiDice distance was used to measure the
distance between proteins in the PPI network. The closeness
between two TFs in PPI network suggests their contribution to
the same or similar biological processes, from which, we can
deduce that these two TFs possess a high probability to be
cooperative. If two TFs are interacted, intuitively, one can
expect their binding occurrence to be enriched in the promoters
of their common TGs compared to the whole genome; further-
more, the distance between their binding sites should be signiﬁ-
cantly shorter than the random expectation. Co-occurrence score
and distance constrain score were compiled from this property.
Researches on various model systems have revealed that
cooperative TFs have complicated patterns of significant co-
expression (Wang et al., 2005), besides, TGs’ expression correl-
ation reﬂects the transient and dynamic natures of TC, which
is potent to explain the context-speciﬁc cooperative behaviour
between TFs. From this, we deduced co-expression feature (see
Materials and Methods section).

To measure the extent to which these evidence resources could
differentiate cooperative and non-cooperative TF pairs, we built

golden standard dataset (GSD). Since combinational regulations
of TFs are dynamic, reliable GSD should depend on specific
conditions (considering HepG2 here). Golden positive dataset
(GPD) consists of 68 cooperative TF pairs (Supplementary
Table S1) and golden negative dataset (GND) includes 428 TF
pairs (Supplementary Table S2). We made comparative analysis
for GSD VS GND. The density plots of four features show
excellent discrimination for positives and negatives (Fig. 2A).
Compared with non-cooperative TF pairs, cooperative TF
pairs display shorter distance in PPI network, closer spatial
relationship in promoter regions, stronger distance constrains
among binding sites and higher correlation on gene expression
pattern, which validates our assumption. Wilcoxon Rank Sum
test was employed to capture the signiﬁcance of difference
between two classes using the features we deﬁned. The P—Values
(inside each density plot of Fig. 2A) indicate signiﬁcantly distin-
guishable power of each feature, which validates the effectiveness
of those features to predict TC.

3.2 Model efﬁciency and performance

The PPI, co-occurrence and distance constraint were considered
as prior information that is independent of the cell type or phys-
ical condition and were integrated through Logistic model as
prior probability to reﬂect the general propensity of cooperativ-
ity. Co-expression calculated from context-speciﬁc gene proﬁling
reﬂects the dynamic and transient behaviour of TC. Then

Bayesian model combines prior information and specific gene
expression information to compute the posterior probability
that a TF pair is conditionally cooperative (see Materials and
Methods section). The EM algorithm was used to maximize the
likelihood function for the estimation of parameters in Bayesian
model. Faster convergence was achieved if we used informative
initial values. Normally, GSD, if available, would be used to
initialize parameters. However, in many cases, it is difﬁcult to
construct a legitimate GSD. We recommended that PPI data
could be used to give an informed starting point. Using PPI-
Validated TF pairs labelled as ‘co-operative’ and randomly
sampled TF pairs labelled as ‘non—co-operative’, we can ﬁt the
parameters in Bayesian model as starting point. Then, regular
EM algorithm was conducted until convergence. With this strat-
egy, the iteration of HepG2 dataset is 154.

As a comparison, we evaluated whether plain starting point
would affect model convergence. We built an equal-sized dataset
as GSD of HepG2 by random sampling without replacement for
TF pairs. Then, each TF pair in the dataset was allocated with a
binary variable indicating ‘co-operative’ or ‘non—co-operative’.
Next, Bayesian model was trained. This process was repeated
for 100 trials. The EM iteration ranges from 400 to 604 with
average of 502 and SD 38 (Fig. 2B), which indicates uninformed
starting point hampers the model efﬁciency.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we first per-
formed comparison with individual feature and straight

Logistic regression that includes four features, using the HepG2
dataset we described before. For individual feature, we simply
used the feature score to predict TF cooperativity. For Bayesian
model and straight Logistic regression, we trained them with
5-fold cross-validation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves of these classiﬁers (Fig. 2C) show that our proposed
Bayesian model consistently outperformed the other tested
classiﬁers. Not surprisingly, multi-feature models performed
better than single feature. At sensitivity of 80%, the false positive
rate of Bayesian model is ~30%, 10%<Logistic regression.
Moreover, Bayesian model has the biggest AUC (area under
ROC curve) of 0.83 while Logistic’s AUC is 0.78. We further
investigated the importance of each feature for Bayesian model
performance. Four features were removed from the model
successively. Each time, only one feature was removed and
Bayesian model was trained on HepG2 dataset. Note that
when co-expression is excluded, the Bayesian model turns to
typical Logistic regression with three features. Figure 3 displays
their performance in terms of ROC. As expected, one-feature-
removed model substantially transcends one-feature-only model
but is inferior to full-feature model. It demonstrates the essenti-
ality of each feature. Although no data type is fully informative
when taken alone, by combination, Bayesian approach is capable
to confidently infer quantitative TC.

3.3 Comparison with other methods

We performed extensional comparison with other existing meth-
ods mentioned in the section 1 to see whether integrated
Bayesian model can predict TC more accurately. Each method
was replayed and its prediction performance was assessed based
on two independent, high-quality benchmark datasets. The ﬁrst
one is HepG2 dataset described before and second one is SK-N-
SH (neuroblastoma speciﬁc) dataset which consists of 68 positive
TF pairs (Supplementary Table S3) and 421 negative TF pairs

(Supplementary Table S4) using the same criteria as HepG2
dataset. Table 1 lists the AUCs (ROC curves in Supplementary
Figure S2), which show that our Bayesian model is better in
predictions than existing algorithms. This favourable results are
due to at least one of the following reasons: (i) the predictive
capability of single data source is inadequate and unilateral while
Bayesian model provide comprehensive prediction by informa-
tion fusion; (ii) although genome-wide TC were predicted
by some methods (Nagamine et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2006a, b),
they neglected the transient and dynamic behaviour of TC;
(iii) we integrated generic features (such as PPI score) and
speciﬁc feature (co-expression) to capture the true cooperative
nature of TFs.

A previous study (Wang et al., 2009) exploited Bayesian net-
work integration of genome-wide data to evaluate TC, which is
conceptually similar to our model. However, there are several
technical differences in methodology. First, among 15 features
deﬁned by Wang et al.(2009), some features represent the same
characteristic only based on different datasets (such as ChIPi
chip-based TG overlap, literature-based TG overlap and motif
occurrence-based TG overlap), which inevitable brings redun-
dant information and dependences among them. We compiled
features from distinct sources, ensuring their approximate uncor-
relation (Supplementary Figure S3) as well as complementation
to each other. Second, the Bayesian network structure is pre-
determined as approximate conditional independences and
inter-dependencies and the parameters are learned from GSD.
As a comparison, our model only needs informative initial values
and accurate parameter estimation can be achieved by EM algo-
rithm. This difference will be notable if GSD is scarce for some
organisms. Third, Wang et al. (2009) labelled all features with
conditional probability and predict the general TF cooperativity
in yeast while we separated features into prior and context-spe-
ciﬁc, identifying the dynamic nature of TC in human. Actually, it
is reported that TF activity and TF synergy are condition-
dependent (Luscombe et al., 2004), which means our model is
more biologically meaningful. Furthermore, our reduced yet
complementary features will make it more feasible to extend
the model to other organisms.

3.4 Prediction of TC during hepatocarcinogenesis

We applied Bayesian model to study the transcriptional regula-
tory mechanism underlying HCC progression. Gene-proﬁling
data of HCC progression were obtained from GEO database
(GSE25097). Since we are highly interested in the cancerization
from cirrhosis to HCC, six samples for healthy liver, 40 for cir-
rhosis, 129 for both HCC with cirrhosis background (short as
cirr-HCC) and adjacent non-tumours were extracted for the

prediction of TC under two contexts: cirrhosis and cirr-HCC.
Among 78210 TF pairs from 396 TFs with available PWMs,
only 3474 pairs have 3 2 common TGs. Additionally, after the
genome-wide searching for TF binding sites at a strict match
score 95%, 1703 pairs were kept under the need of co-occurrence
on the same promoter. We deﬁned these 1703 TF pairs as
‘qualiﬁed’ before the application of Bayesian model. Due to
the removal of some TF pairs whose TGs were not expressed
in our gene profiling, posterior probability of 1665 and 1662 TF
pairs are calculated for the two contexts.

To discover the carcinoma associated TC alterations over two
contexts, seven HCC-related TFs were chosen from Cancer
Resource dataset (Ahmed et al., 2011). The variability map
(Fig. 4) presents the degree of variability among the partners
of a given TF from cirrhosis to cirr-HCC. Cooperative partners
almost retained the same for FOS, SP1 and TP53 over two
contexts (for instance, JUN and ETSl for FOS, E2F1 and
POU2F1 for SP1, TFAP2A and GATA2 for TP53). However,
dominate tendency was observed among DDIT3, E2Fl, HIFlA
and RXRA that some of their partners were only cooperative
under cirrhosis.

3.5 Recasting TC network of hepatocarcinogenesis

To obtain a systematic-level perspective, we recast TC as a net-
work. For comparison between cirrhosis and cirr-HCC, we
framed same scale networks of TF pairs with top 100 highest
posterior probability (all >0.9, except ETSliFOS in cirr-HCC
with 0.89), wherein the nodes are TFs and the edges designate
interactions (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). We
then mapped the interactions in the derived networks to non-
redundant protein complex dataset based on CORUM (Ruepp
et al., 2010). Seven and six TF pairs were found co—occur in at
least one protein complex for cirrhosis and cirr-HCC, respect-
ively. Besides, we also used TFiTF interaction data extracted
from TcoF database (Schaefer et al., 2011) to validate our pre-
dictions, which resulted in 30 and 26 TF pairs with interaction
evidences. In total, 31 and 27 interactions were validated in
cirrhosis and cirr-HCC networks separately. To evaluate the
signiﬁcance of predicted networks, we randomly sampled
100 TF pairs for 2000 trials and averagely 11 pairs were validated
by protein complex and TFiTF interaction information, demon-
strating that our derived TC networks are highly signiﬁcant
(P—Value<5 x 104‘ for cirrhosis and <1 x 10’3 for cirr-HCC).

Fig. 5. Transcriptional cooperativity networks using TF pairs with top
100 highest posterior probabilities. (A) Network for cirrhosis.
(B) Network for cirr-HCC. Node denotes TF whose size is proportion
to the degree in the network. Edge represents cooperative relationship.
All validated interactions are in solid lines and novel ones are in dashed
lines. Grey, green and blue lines designate interactions shared by two
contexts, speciﬁc in cirrhosis and speciﬁc in cirr-HCC, respectively

Both our results recapitulated previously reported observations
and revealed novel potential interactions, which could provide
novel insight into the molecular mechanism controlling forma-
tive carcinogenesis.

Each TC network consists of 100 interactions which involve 59
TFs and 41 TFs for cirrhosis (Fig. 5A) and cirr-HCC (Fig. 5B),
respectively. Comparisons between TC networks revealed that
when the disease progression switches from cirrhosis to HCC,
TC changes correspondingly. Nevertheless 68 relationships (grey
lines) were observed consistently under different conditions,
which can indicate the development and progression of carcino-
genesis share highly common regulations. Moreover, ETSl,
GATA2, SP1, EGRl and MYC are consistently hub TFs over
two contexts.

The interactions among these ﬁve hub TFs are conserved
during the progression. However, hub TFs have more speciﬁc
interactions with other TFs under cirr-HCC. For instance, there
are 13 speciﬁc interactions with ETSl under cirr-HCC while
only one under the context of cirrhosis. These ﬁve hub TFs
could be regarded as pivotal factors to understand the molecular
mechanism that underlies the development and progression of
carcinogenesis.

3.6 Functional analysis of speciﬁc cooperativity

We took speciﬁc cooperativity of E2F17TFAP2C versus E2F17
TP53 and speciﬁc transcriptional complex FO$EP30(LJUNB
versus FO&ETS17NFKB1, all extracted from the TC networks,
as the instances to investigate the potential molecular mechanism
underlying the cancerization from cirrhosis to HCC.

E2F1 possesses a speciﬁc cooperativity with pro-inﬂammatory
factor TFAP2C under cirrhosis and tumour suppressor TP53
under cirr-HCC. We found that many differentially expressed
TGs regulated by this TF pair are enriched in regulation of
biosynthetic and metabolic process for cirrhosis while cell
cycle, apoptotic and cell death for cirr-HCC. For instance,
the cooperativity of E2F1 and TFAP2C regulates the folic
acid-containing compound biosynthetic and metabolic process
(Bonferroni-adjusted P—Value< 1.4 x 10’s), which has been

Identification of specific transcriptional cooperativity

 

linked with the effect of alcohol consumption on liver damage
and progression towards HCC, by inhibiting formyltetrahydro-
folate synthetase (M THFDI) (Persson et al., 2013). As a com-
parison, E2F1 and TP53 cooperate to promote cell-cycle
progression (Bonferroni-adjusted P—Value<2.4x 104) by acti-
vating G1 /S-related gene CCNE] and PCNA, G2 phase-related
gene TOP2A, G2/M-related gene TUBA4A and G2/M-, M/Gl-
related gene CCNDI (Whitﬁeld et al., 2002). The uncontrolled
cell cycle is one of the major aspects for cancers. Additionally,
there exists evidence that the synergy of E2F1 and TP53 can
induce apoptosis (Wu and Levine, 1994), which may be achieved
through co-regulating apoptosis factor TP53BP2 according to
our analysis.

Speciﬁc cooperativity FO&EP30(%JUNB is observed under
cirrhosis. It was shown that EP300 can stimulate activity of the
FO$JUN complex in vivo and part of this response was con-
veyed through direct interaction of EP300 with FOS (Bannister
and Kouzarides, 1995). There were reports that dentin matrix
protein 1 (DMP1) was transcriptionally regulated by TF FOS
(Narayanan et al., 2002) and the cooperative interaction of
JUNB with EP300 remarkably mediates the DMP1-promoter
activity during mineralization, which was conﬁrmed in vivo by
immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation ana-
lysis. Further, phosphorylation of J UNB was found to be essen-
tial for its interaction with EP300 (Narayanan et al., 2004).
Although DMP1 is an ArgiGlyiAsp-containing acidic phospho-
protein that was originally thought to be a mineralized extracel-
lular matrices components (George et al., 1993), DMP1 mRNA
was later detected in non-mineralized mouse tissues including
liver, muscle, brain, pancreas and kidney by RTiPCR
(Terasawa et al., 2004). More recently, it was demonstrated
that DMP1 can block proliferation, migration, tubulogenesis
responses and tumour-associated angiogenesis by modulating
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which expands the
role of DMP1 in angiogenic field for the ﬁrst time (Pirotte et al.,
2011). Our predicted cooperativity may provide upstream tran-
scriptional mechanism for the angiogensic function of DMP1,
which is implicated in the regeneration of hepatocytes and con-
tributes to the development of fibrous bands in hepatic cirrhosis
(Corpechot et al., 2002; Fernandez et al., 2009). Speciﬁc coop-
erativity ETSliFOS and ETSliNFKBl forming complex
FO&ETS17NFKB1 are observed under cirr-HCC. Cis-acting
elements with AP1, ETS-like and NFKappaB binding motifs
have been identiﬁed in the promoter region of the granulocyte-
macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSFZ) gene (Thomas
et al., 1997), which encodes GMiCSF cytokine involved in dif-
ferentiation, proliferation and activation of the hematopoietic
system. The results suggest constitutive ETSl as well as inducible
NFKBl and FOS cooperate as a transcriptional complex in acti-
vated T cells. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis for
common TGs shared by FOSiETSliNFKBl showed that the
most signiﬁcant one is ‘pathways in cancer’ (Bonferroni-adj usted
P—Value< 1.8 x 104). Possibly, speciﬁc complex FO&ETS17
NFKBl can function in activated T cells by regulating CSF2
which cooperates with other genes involved in cancer pathways
and result in promoting hepatocyte necrosis, inﬂammation and
regeneration, ultimately carcinogenesis (Block et al., 2003; Zhao
et al., 2012).

Bayesian approach can penetrate the limitations of qualita-
tive inference from experiments and inadequate capability of
individual data source. It provided rigorously quantitative meas-
urement of TC. Furthermore, the prior information reﬂects the
general propensity of TC, which sets the stage for tissue- or dis-
ease-speciﬁc analysis of regulatory programs. This approach is
compatible for discretionary gene proﬁling, ensuring its adapt-
ability. However, the Bayesian approach has its own limitations.
Owing to the size of the TF repertoire and a small portion of
reported PWMs so far, the overall landscape of TC is difﬁcult to
be identiﬁed. On the other hand, to assure the specificity of this
model, 1000 bases upstream from TSS was considered in our
study and a strict threshold was set for the pattern search of
PWMs, which would miss a considerable portion of qualiﬁed
TF pairs. Nevertheless, this model is able to capture the dynamic
nature of TC by comprehensive analysis of data from multiple
cascades. We believe that our proposed Bayesian approach is a
promising application in identifying tissue- or disease-speciﬁc TC
and will further facilitate the interpretation of underlying mech-
anisms for various physiological conditions.

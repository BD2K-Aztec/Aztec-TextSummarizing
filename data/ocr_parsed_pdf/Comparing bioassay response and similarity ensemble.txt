ABSTRACT

Motivation: Networks to predict protein pharmacology can be
created using ligand similarity or using known bioassay response
profiles of ligands. Recent publications indicate that similarity
methods can be highly accurate, but it has been unclear how
similarity methods compare to methods that use bioassay response
data directly.

Results: We created protein networks based on ligand similarity
(Similarity Ensemble Approach or SEA) and ligand bioassay
response-data (BARD) using 155 Pfizer internal BioPrint assays. Both
SEA and BARD successfully cluster together proteins with known
relationships, and predict some non-obvious relationships. Although
the approaches assess target relations from different perspectives,
their networks overlap considerably (40% overlap of the top 2%
of correlated edges). They can thus be considered as comparable
methods, with a distinct advantage of the similarity methods that
they only require simple computations (similarity of compound) as
opposed to extensive experimental data.

1 INTRODUCTION

The study of the impact of drugs and Chemical compounds
across multiple protein targets (polypharmacology) is of increasing
importance, for many reasons including ﬁnding new therapeutic
indications for known drugs, understanding the causes of drug
side effects, proﬁling off-target interactions, and understanding
the role of proteins and their associated genes using Chemical
compounds as probes. This latter application is of particular interest,
as protein targets can share the same natural ligand but be Classiﬁed
completely differently from a protein function perspective: for
example, the targets of opioid methadone are [,L-OplOld receptor and
N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor, which belong to two
different types of target Class (GPCR and Ion Channel). Detection
of this relationship between protein targets is extremely difﬁcult
with knowledge of the targets alone. In general, protein sequence
similarity is not well correlated with the Chemical similarity of

known ligand sets (Hert et al. 2008). Relating proteins using
ligand similarity can thus be a complementary tool to study
biological function, and can be incorporated into wider ‘network
pharmacology’ systems (Hopkins, 2008).

Ligand-based similarity of two protein targets can be calculated
either by comparing the activity proﬁles of sets of ligands against a
reference set of ligands for both two targets (activity similarity)
or by comparing the Chemical structure similarities of the two
sets of ligands (Chemical similarity). Vieth et al. (2004) presented
the ﬁrst dendrogram of kinases based entirely on small molecule
selectivity data and proposed a similarity measure, SARsim, using
the difference of log IC50 values. Paolini et al. (2006) built target—
target similarity networks using the polypharmacology interaction
strength, the fraction of compounds tested against two proteins
that have comparable binding afﬁnity. A similar approach was
applied in PubChem BioAssay networks linking two assays if they
share at least one active compound (Chen et (11., 2009). Metz and
Hajduk (2010) reviewed a number of recent activity similarity
methods and their use at Abbott Laboratories. Keiser et al. (2007)
used Chemical similarity between ligand sets (Similarity Ensemble
Approach or SEA) to study the pharmacological relations and
found many unexpected relationships, some of which were later
proved experimentally. Bender’s group used substructure mining
to determine the similarity between groups of ligands to Classify
GPCRs (van der Horst et al., 2010).

The studies based on the activity similarity approach are limited
by the lack of large-scale SAR data (for many compounds against
many targets) and thus have only focused on particular Classes of
targets such as kinases, and are also limited in that they do not in
any way take into account Chemical similarity between the ligands.
Conversely, the similarity-based approaches such as SEA do not
take account of the degrees of Chemical protein interaction. The
SEA method has been subject to limited experimental validation
(which showed positive results) but has not been evaluated against
a wide range of targets.

In this article, we carried out an evaluation using a large
experimental set at Pﬁzer (called BioAssay Response Data or
BARD) that is extracted from Pﬁzer BioPrint collections (Krejsa
et al., 2003). BARD contains 155 biological assays with at least
10 active compounds, and 5672 unique compounds along with
their binding afﬁnities. Using a variety of similarity and statistical
association methods, we created BARD Networks from this data to
project the known target relationships, and then compared this with
the network derived from SEA.

Comparing BARD and SEA

 

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

The dataset was created from Pﬁzer BioPrint assay collections in which the
bioassay response data (measured by IC50 in this case) are of high quality and
reproducible. IC50 computed from doseiresponse assay indicates how much
of a particular substance is needed to inhibit 50% of the biological function of
a target. A compound with IC50 <= 10 000 nm is considered as active against
the target. Only the assays with at least 10 active compounds were selected.
leaving 155 assays along with 5672 unique compounds. IC50 values ranged
from 0.01 nm to 7.9E6 nm. with a mean of 10040 nm. All the compound
structures were cleaned Via normalizing ligand protonation and ﬁltering
salts and fragments. Assays were categorized into seven classes (amine
transporters. in vitro metabolism. peptide receptors. enzymes. non-peptide
receptors. ion channels and nuclear receptors) based on Cerep Bioassay
classiﬁcation (www.cerep.fr). Assay descriptions and their categorizations
are available in the Supplementary Material.

2.2 BARD

Within the BARD method we employed four techniques for calculating
similarity between protein targets based on their activity proﬁles: Spearman’s
rank correlation coefﬁcient. Tanimoto coefﬁcient. Wilcoxon signed rank test
and polypharmacology interaction strength.

Spearman 's rank correlation coeﬁfcient: this measures how well the
relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic
function. although it does not require a linear relation of two variables. The
coefﬁcient between a pair of assays r is calculated as:

62d?
_ n(n2 — 1)
where n is the total number of common compounds. and for each compound
i. d,» is the difference between the ranks of the compounds in the two target
lists ranked by IC50. This coefﬁcient is also applied to study the correlation
of proteiniprotein networks in the network comparison section.

Tanimoto coeﬁfcient (also known as Jaccard index): the coefﬁcient TC is
calculated as:

(1)

# of common actives 2
_ # of total common compounds ( )

Thus. this measure describes the fraction of compounds shared between
the two ligand lists. which are active in both assays.

Wilcoxon signea1 rank test: since IC50 is not really normally distributed.
instead of using paired Student’s t-test. we used the Wilcoxon signed rank
test. which compares the IC50 values of ligands for both targets A and B by
taking the absolute difference |IC5OA -IC5OB| across all common compounds.
The pairs are ranked by the absolute difference and then assigned sign ‘+’
to the pair with IC50A > IC5OB or sign ‘—’ to the pair with IC5OA < IC5OB.
The sums of the ranks of positive pairs (W+) and negative pairs (W—) are
calculated separately. P-Value is calculated by comparing the smaller score
between W+ and W— with a critical value under certain conﬁdence intervals.

Polypharmacology interaction strength: polypharmacology interaction
strength proposed by Hopkins (Paolini et al.. 2006). simply measures the
similarity Pi]- between two targets i and j using the following formula:

_ Nij(same)

U _ Nij(total) (3)

where Ni]- total is the number of compounds commonly tested against both
targets i and j. Ni]- same is the number of compounds shared by both targets
i and j under a condition where the log difference in potency is smaller than
a given number n (for instance n = 1 is a 10-fold difference in potency). We
consider the fold change as 1 since IC50 in our data does not vary widely.

2.3 SEA

SEA was originally used to investigate protein similarity based on the
structural similarity between their ligand sets. and later successfully applied

to drug target prediction (Keiser et al.. 2009). SEA calculates a raw score by
summing up the Tanimoto similarity of the chemical structural ﬁngerprints
of all interesting pairs between two ligand sets. An E-Value derived from
a statistical model presents the probability of observing this raw score by
random chance alone. The smaller E-Value indicates the stronger relation of
two proteins. It was ﬁrst applied to investigate the relations of 256 targets
from MDDR. and further approved to be capable of studying proteins in other
datasets (DeGraw et al.. 2010) as long as certain conditions are reached:
e.g. the z-scores derived from random samples conform to extreme value
distribution (EVD). We randomly sampled 300000 pairs of compound sets
populated from BioPrint data. with each set size ranging from 10 to 1000
compounds and for each pair. all the compound pairs were numerated and
the similarity scores of the signiﬁcant pairs were summed up under different
similarity thresholds. The expected mean and variance could be calculated
based on the model derived from our dataset (Supplementary Figure 52a
and b). We found that z-scores with 0.57 as the similarity threshold (it is
the default in the original paper) ﬁt to EVD (Supplementary Figure S2c).
We used compounds with activity <10 um. and used ECFP6 (Rogers et al..
2005) and Tanimoto coefﬁcient (Holliday et al.. 2002) to measure similarity.

2.4 Network building and comparison

The similarities between all the assay pairs were calculated by the listed
similarity measurements. Some pairs. due to a limited number of shared
compounds. were ignored as they were not appropriate for some similarity
functions. An edge was formed in a given network between two proteins if
their similarity exceeded a speciﬁed threshold (which varies among different
measurements). The networks were Visualized in Cytoscape (Shannon et al..
2003) and analyzed using its plugins (Assenov et al.. 2008). BARD and SEA
were quantitatively compared by calculating the Spearman rank correlation
coefﬁcient between the pairs derived from the measurements for each
method. A higher coefﬁcient indicates two measurements are behaving
similarly. Similarity between the methods was also evaluated by the number
of common edges between the networks built under various conditions. for
example. the networks using top 100 most correlated pairs.

3 RESULTS

3.1 BARD analysis

We used 155 assays from the BioPrint set that had at least
10 actives (deﬁned as an IC50 <= 10000 nm), resulting in
78 863 IC50 values for 5672 unique compounds. The relation
of each pair of assays was calculated using Spearman’s rank
correlation coefﬁcient (Spearman), Tanimoto Coefﬁcient (TC),
Polypharmacology Interaction Strength (Interaction Strength), and
Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Wilcoxon). Since the relation between
two measurements is sensitive to the number of common compounds
(Metz and Hajduk, 2010), the pairs with the number of common
compounds <30 were ignored, leaving 5763 pairs for the further
analysis. Figure 1 shows BARD value distributions among
measurements. Spearman ranges from —1 to 1, indicating the
relation strength between two assays. A positive value means a
positive correlation: 0 means no correlation at all; 1 means a perfect
positive correlation. Spearman is near normally distributed, with a
skewed curve on the right. For Interaction Strength and TC, 1 means
the perfect relation as well. Since the compounds used here were
those, which passed the primary screening, in which the inactives
or uninteresting compounds would be detected and then removed in
the following assay (the distribution of actives and inactives in each
assay could be found in Supplementary Figure S1), the average TC is
quite high. IC50 values in our data do not vary widely, but interaction

strength, although only 1 fold change is considered, is comparatively
high. P-values rendered in Wilcoxon are quite different from others.

3.2 Correlations between BARD and SEA

The Spearman correlations among all the measurements are not as
high as expected, ranging from —0.554 to 0.395 (Table 1). Wilcoxon
has little relation with Spearman (—0.099), Interaction Strength
(0.364, a negative number is expected) and TC (—0.279). Despite
the fact that Interaction Strength and TC measure the fraction of
shared active compounds against tested compounds, their results
are not well correlated. Spearman is correlated with at least two
measurements in BARD (Interaction Strength and TC). Both TC
and Spearman are highly correlated with SEA, slightly higher than
the reported average correlation 0.368 (Hert et al., 2008) between
SEA and Bayesian model which is another structural similarity
measurement.

3.3 Overlaps of networks between BARD and SEA

Also of interest is how similar the networks are using only edges of
interest rather than the correlation between similarity matrixes. The
networks built using the top correlated edges, e.g. top 1% most
correlated edges, were compared in Table 2 with respect to the
overlap ratio of their edges. The networks derived from Interaction

Strength, Spearman, TC and Wilcoxon in BARD are actually quite
different. Particularly, Interaction Strength and Wilcoxon have low
overlap with others. It is interesting that Spearman and SEA have
nearly 40% overlap using the 2% most correlated edges, much higher
than others. The overlap ratio does not change greatly with different
thresholds; again, it is close to the result 0.40 between SEA network
and Bayesian model networks (Hert et (11., 2008). TC has little
overlap with SEA at 1 or 2%, but the ratio increases as the number of
edges selected increases. While it has 63% overlap with SEA on top
10% edges, that approximates the observation that TC has overall
the strongest relation with SEA (spearman correlation: —0.554) in
Table 1.

Figure 2 shows the networks built from the top 2% most correlated
edges using both BARD/Spearman and SEA. The networks clearly
link targets from the same gene family. For example, M1, M2, M3,
M4 and M5 form a clique in BARD network where every pair
is linked, indicating these muscarinic receptors share very similar
binding proﬁles. The top 5 most similar targets with 5-HT2B from
both the BARD network and the SEA network belong to the same
gene family (Table 3). However differences exist: SEA interlinks
many non-peptide receptors, while BARD using Spearman renders
more islands. Figure 3 shows that while variance between the
networks is large, overall they have a positive correlation: pairs
of targets considered similar in BARD are often considered similar
in SEA. However, some similar pairs in BARD are not captured
by SEA, vice versa; hence both can be considered complementary
tools to uncover similar target pairs from ligand sets. For instance,
Kappa and Kappa (h) (Fig. 4b) are orthologous, expressed in pig and
human, respectively, it is not surprising that both share very similar
binding activity captured by BARD (Spearman 0.829, the 48th most
correlated pair), while the associated E-value in SEA is 9.56E-
06, ranked it at 1286, out of 5763 pairs. For Glucocorticoid and
Androgen (Fig. 4a) are steroid receptors, SEA (E-value: 1.60E-58)
suggests their strong relation, however, BARD (Spearman: 0.106)
does not show the relation at all. The most similar target with
5-HT2B (agonist site/DOI) is the same target but tested under a
different condition (in the LSD agonist site) (Fig. 40), while SEA
ranks this target out of top 5 most similar targets (Table 3).

Analysis of these networks could facilitate decision making during
experiments. The properties of the neighbors of a target should be
considered when we are attempting to design a selective compound
(Table 3). Common edges between two networks imply the strong
relation of two targets from either activity data or structure similarity.
Attention must be paid to the higher degree nodes, as compounds
active in those promiscuous targets likely interact with their neighbor
targets. Table 4 shows that non-peptide receptors are likely to be
promiscuous among 155 targets. Such promiscuous targets detection
will be more reliable especially when a large-scale protein—protein
network is obtained.

The unexpected links connecting two targets from different gene
families are of great interest as such relations are not able to be
captured using only biological knowledge alone. For example, UTl
(urotensin receptor) shares very similar binding properties with 5-
HT3 (spearman: 0.534), but we could ﬁnd no literature relating these
two receptors. Acetylcholinesterase and N-type Ca channel although
are structurally different, they are related to neurotransmitters. The
former degrades the neurotransmitter through its hydrolytic activity;
the latter is found primarily at presynaptic terminals and is involved
in neurotransmitter release (Kurihara and Tanabe, 2003).

3.4 Network robustness

To address concerns about overﬁtting, networks created from
different datasets were compared. For each measurement, we
randomly sampled 70% of the original dataset to build a new network
and checked the overlap ratio with the network derived from the
original dataset. We repeated the experiment ﬁve times. SEA and
BARD both seem fairly robust against the datasets used (Table 5),
while in BARD, the threshold increases to 50%, the network is nearly
the same as that with the original dataset.

3.5 Obvious link detection

Targets from the same gene family often tend to link together as
they are expected to share similar binding properties, although some
unexpected links would be found occasionally. We carried out one
experiment in which we retrieved a certain number of top edges, and
then looked at the number of obvious links (links from same family)

under each measurement. Figure 5 shows Spearman/BARD has
more obvious links than SEA, particularly, when only a small
number of top correlated edges are examined. In contrast, SEA tends
to uncover a greater number of non-obvious links.

4 DISCUSSION

BARD and SEA assess target relations using ligand data but
from two perspectives. BARD measures relationship between two
proteins based on correlations of the proteins’ proﬁles of compounds
that are known to be active against them; SEA assumes if the
active compounds between two proteins have certain structural
similarity, the two proteins would share similar pharmacology. These
approaches are clearly different, but the approaches share a distinct
correlation of their results. The network from BARD/Spearman has
overall nearly 40% overlap with that from SEA. Clearly though each
method highlights relationships not found by the other, so they can
be considered complementary. SEA, unlike BARD, does not require
a complete matrix of experimental results of all compounds against
all targets; one only needs to have a list of active compounds for each

target, followed by a simple ﬁngerprint-based similarity calculation.
It is therefore much more widely applicable than the BARD method,
as such complete data matrices are rare. Indeed the high degree of
overlap between the SEA and BARD methods represents ﬁirther
experimental validation of the SEA method.

BARD requires selection of the technique for correlating activity
proﬁles. Our experiments show some signiﬁcant differences in the
correlations between these techniques and the resultant networks
produced. These differences are most likely due to the differing
manner in which each method handles the IC50 data: Wilcoxon
uses differences in actual values, and Tanimoto and Interaction
strength use cutoffs to determine whether a ligand is ‘active’ or
not. Cutoffs can be sensitive to the inherent experimental variation
in results especially when, as here, there is a tight distribution of
values, and a small variation can result in a polarizing change of
classiﬁcation. Wilcoxon is used for assessing whether population
mean between two samples differ, while the high similarity between
two targets does not necessarily need the means of their ligand
activities closing, vice versa (http://assay.nih.gov/assay/index.php).
For example, Wilcoxon does not show the strong similarity between
Kappa receptor in pig and Kappa receptor in human (Fig. 4b), but
presents 5-HT2B is quite similar with Ca2+ channel (Fig. 4d), which
is not intuitive either from an activity data distribution standpoint
or from a biological perspective. We thus feel most conﬁdent in the
Spearman method, which considers only rank and not the actual
values themselves.

The pharmacology protein network should serve as a useﬁil
tool to analyze the properties of targets and further facilitate
decision making during experiments. For instance, the neighbors
would suggest the priorities of assays for a compound. In addition,
threshold selection accounts for the network structure. E -value lower
than 1 in SEA means the signiﬁcant similarity between two targets,
and the pairs with E-value smaller than lE-10 in SEA usually are
empirically considered as a very strong relation. One signiﬁcant
issue with this is in a case when we are dealing with a constrained
dataset, for example of Kinases. In such cases, SEA can create
a ‘hairball’ effect where all targets are strongly related and thus
signiﬁcant relationships are lost in the background noise. Such
situations can be tackled by using very small E-values (e.g. <
10‘”), although a more complex treatment may be warranted.
The threshold in BARD depends on the nature of the datasets, for
example, if more inactive compounds are involved in TC analysis,
the center of TCs would shift to the left. Similarly, Spearman is
not meaningful without the context of dataset. One solution to
overcome this problem is to convert Spearman rho score to a P-value
by introducing random samples. For each target pair, IC50s are
randomly shufﬂed for a large number of times, yielding a new
sets of Spearman scores, which are assumed normally distributed,
then it allows to calculate P-value based on the normally distributed
random samples. Again, manual decision of P-value cutoff has to
be made to build the network.

In conclusion, we built protein pharmacology networks using
a high quality and nearly full bioassay response data matrix,
followed by quantitatively comparisons among different similarity
measurements including SEA based on structural similarity.
We found networks built from BARD (e.g., Spearman correlation
coefﬁcient) are correlated with those from SEA, but both predict
unique relationships. Large-scale network construction would allow
us to capture the overall pharmacology relations of proteins, and
further facilitate network pharmacology study.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In silico methods provide efficient ways to predict pos-
sible interactions between drugs and targets. Supervised learning
approach, bipartite local model (BLM), has recently been shown to
be effective in prediction of drug—target interactions. However, for
drug-candidate compounds or target-candidate proteins that currently
have no known interactions available, its pure ‘local’ model is not able
to be learned and hence BLM may fail to make correct prediction
when involving such kind of new candidates.

Results: We present a simple procedure called neighbor-based
interaction-profile inferring (NH) and integrate it into the existing BLM
method to handle the new candidate problem. Specifically, the
inferred interaction profile is treated as label information and is used
for model learning of new candidates. This functionality is particularly
important in practice to find targets for new drug-candidate com-
pounds and identify targeting drugs for new target-candidate proteins.
Consistent good performance of the new BLM—Nll approach has been
observed in the experiment for the prediction of interactions between
drugs and four categories of target proteins. Especially for nuclear
receptors, BLM—Nll achieves the most significant improvement as
this dataset contains many drugs/targets with no interactions in the
cross-validation. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the NH strat-
egy and also shows the great potential of BLM—Nll for prediction of
compound—protein interactions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identiﬁcation of interactions between drugs/compounds and
protein targets is an important part of the drug discovery pipe-
line. The great advances in molecular medicine and the human
genome project provide more opportunities to discover unknown
associations in the compoundiprotein interaction network. The
newly discovered interactions are helpful for discovering new
drugs by screening candidate compounds and also may help
understand the causes of side effects of existing drugs. Since
experimental way to determine drugitarget interactions is
costly and time-consuming, in silico prediction becomes a

potential complement that provides useful information in an
efﬁcient way.

Generally, the prediction performance is decided by both the
data used and the particular analysis method that is applied to.
An intuitive and straightforward way to identify new targets for
a drug is to compare the candidate proteins with those existing
targets of that drug. Different results may be obtained depending
on which perspective the comparison is made with respect to.
Keiser et a]. (2009) compare targets based on the chemical struc-
ture of ligands that bind to them. As reviewed in Haupt and
Schroeder (2011), the structure of binding sites is another import-
ant way to compare proteins or to measure the similarity be-
tween proteins. Although binding site is an effective measure
for identiﬁcation of new targets, the structures of binding site
are only available for a small set of proteins, of which the 3D
structures are known. To be able to consider more proteins,
amino acid sequence may be used as it is available for most
proteins. Similarly, to identify new targeting compounds for a
speciﬁc target, comparison is made on the compound side or
drug side with respect to chemical structures (Laggner et al.,
2012; Martin et al., 2002), side effects (Campillos et al., 2008)
or other possible measurements of drug.

More sophisticated statistical and machine learning methods
have been developed recently for prediction of genome-wide
drugitarget interactions. In He et a]. (2010) and Perlman et a].
(2011), multiple groups of drug-related features and
protein-related features have been extracted to describe each
drugitarget pair. After feature selection, a certain classiﬁer is
used to predict whether a given pair is interacting or not.
Yamanishi et a]. (2008) proposed a supervised bipartite graph
learning approach. In this approach, the chemical space and the
geometric space are mapped into a uniﬁed space so that those
interacting drugs and targets are close to each other while those
non-interacting drugs and targets are far away from each other.
By mapping the query pair of drug and target to that space with
the learned mapping function, the probability of interaction
between them is then calculated as their closeness in the
mapped space. Another method called the weighted proﬁle
method was also given in Yamanishi et a]. (2008). For a query
drug, the weighted proﬁle method assigns a probability of
interaction to the query target based on how the neighbors of
this drug interact with this target. Basically, weighted proﬁle is a
nearest-neighbor approach and it is called drug-based/target-
based similarity inference in Cheng et a]. (2012). Other than

Bipartite model for learning from local information and neighbors

 

inferring interactions from the drug similarity or target
similarity, network-based inference was also studied in
Cheng et al. (2012), which infers or predicts drugitarget inter-
actions based on the topology of the known interaction network.
Different from the work in Cheng et al. (2012), which makes use
of the drug similarity, target similarity and network-based simi-
larity separately, Chen et al. (2012) apply random walk on a
heterogeneous network constructed with these three types of
similarities. Another promising approach is the bipartite local
model (BLM) approach. Bleakley and Yamanishi (2009)
showed that the ensemble of independent drug-based prediction
and target-based prediction with supervised learning performs
much better than only using each single type of prediction. The
BLM method has been further studied and improved in Xia et al.
(2010) and Laarhoven et al. (2011). The main differences of these
three methods include the drugwlrug and targetitarget similari-
ties, the classiﬁers and the way used to combine the drug-based
and target-based interaction probabilities. In Xia et al. (2010),
semi-supervised approach is used instead of supervised approach
for local model learning; while Laarhoven et a]. (2011) found
that using only the kernel based on the topology of the known
interaction network is able to obtain a very good performance.

In the existing framework of BLM, the model for the query
drug or target is learned based on local information, i.e. its own
interaction proﬁle. Despite a good performance, BLM has limi-
tations. It is unable to learn without training data and hence is
not able to provide a reasonable prediction for drug/target can-
didates that are currently new. Here, a drug-candidate com-
pound is new if it does not have any known targets, and a
target-candidate protein is new if it is not targeted by any
drugs/compounds. We call this the new candidate problem of
BLM. Since a large number of compounds and proteins, which
are possible drug candidates and target candidates, respectively,
are new, in this study, we focus on handling the new candidate
problem by proposing an improved version of BLM called BLM
with neighbor-based interaction-proﬁle inferring (BLMiNII).
The NH procedure is developed to incorporate the capacity of
learning from neighbors into the original BLM method. More
speciﬁcally, when the query involves a new drug/target candi-
date, we first derive the initial weighted interactions for the
new candidate from its neighbors’ interaction proﬁles, and then
use the inferred interactions as label information to train the
model. In general, neighbors refer to compounds/proteins that
have large similarities to the query compound/protein.

The presented NII idea happen to be similar to the weighted
proﬁle method in some sense. However, our BLMiNII method
is substantially different from the weighted proﬁle method in the
following aspects. In BLMiNII, the derived interaction proﬁle is
used as label information to train the local model or the classi-
ﬁer, while in the weighted proﬁle method, the derived weighted
interaction is directly used as the ﬁnal predicted interaction prob-
ability. Moreover, in BLMiNII, the N11 procedure is integrated
into the BLM framework where a certain classiﬁer plays the
main role in model learning, and N11 is activated only for new
drug/target candidates; while in the weighted proﬁle method,
there is no other classiﬁer and the procedure of deriving the
weighted proﬁle acts as a classiﬁcation process, which is applied
for any drug/target candidates. To sum up, the BLMiNII is an
enhanced BLM method, and it is different from the weighted

profile method, which is a nearest-neighbor approach. Our ex-
perimental results show that BLMiNII performs much better
than the weighted profile method.

Systematic experiments are conducted to simulate the task of
drugitarget interactions prediction cross four datasets.
Compared with state-of—the-art approaches, our proposed
approach achieves consistent improvement in terms of area
under ROC (AUC) curve and area under precision versus
recall (AUPR) curve. As these four datasets contain different
portions of new drug candidates and target candidates in the
simulation, the improvements of BLMiNII compared with
BLM are also different for the four datasets. The most signiﬁcant
improvement is achieved on the nuclear receptor dataset, which
contains the largest portion of new candidates. This shows that
the N11 strategy, i.e. to infer label information or training
data from neighbors when there is no training data readily avail-
able from the query compound/protein itself, is feasible and ef-
fective for dealing with the new candidate problem of the original
BLM.

2 METHODS
2.1 Problem formalization

Assume that the bipartite interaction network N1 illustrated in Figure 1
involves md drugs/compounds and ml targets, which are referred to as
existing drug candidates and target candidates, respectively. We use
matrix A to represent this network, i.e. a,/EA= 1 if the i-th compound
d,- is known to interact with the j-th target ti. All other entries of A are 0.
The problem under consideration is how to make use of the
known interactions together with the compound similarities and protein
similarities to predict new interactions between nd drug-candidate com-
pounds and nl target-candidate proteins, where nd >md and nl>ml. This
means there are m, 2 nd — md new drug candidates and W, = n, — mt
new target candidates, which have no interactions currently known.
The whole network involving nd compounds and nl proteins can be rep-
resented as

(Ndmdxm. (N2)mdxm.]:[A 0], (1)

N xn =
"d ‘ [(mem, (N4)mdxm, 0 0

where known interactions correspond to non-zero entries of A. Now, we
want to predict possible interactions in N1 between existing drug candi-
dates and target candidates, as well as in other three subnetworks N2, N3
and N4, where the interactions at least involve one type of new

candidates, i.e. the target candidate is new, the drug candidate is new or
both are new.

2.2 Bipartite local model

To predict [7,7, the probability that a drug d,- and a target t, interact,
the basic BLM proposed by Bleakley and Yamanishi (2009) is described
as follows. A local model for d,- denoted as Modd(i) is ﬁrst learned
based on its interaction proﬁle a; and the similarities between targets
Sl, i.e.

Modd(i) = train(St, a’,). (2)

Here, train represents the learning process of a certain classiﬁer, e.g.
support vector machine or (Kernel) regularized least squares (RLS), the
similarity matrix Sl is used as the observed data of target candidates, and
the interaction proﬁle a;, i.e. the i-th row vector of A, serves as label
information to label each target candidate whether interacting with this
drug. Once the model Modd(i) is learned, it is used to predict pg, the

probability of interaction between d,- and the query target candidate t]:
pg. : test(Modd(i), 5;), (3)

where 51’. is the j-th column of Sl recording the similarities between t, and
other targets. The similar model learning and prediction process are
performed independently from the query-target side to get pf], i.e.

Modt(j) = train(Sd, 21,), (4)

pf]. = test(Modt(}), Sid), (5)

where a, is the j-th column vector of A or the interaction proﬁle of target
ti. Once both pg. and pg. have been calculated, they are combined to get
probability [7,]:

pi,- = $173,173), (6)

where g is a function that combines or integrates pg. and  Examples
include pi]- : max{pg.,p§j} and pi]- : 0.5073. +173), where g is the max or
average function.

After 17,-, is calculated for each pair of compound i and protein j, the
output network of BLM may be represented as

N113LM N123LM

with
N‘l’LM = N1 + P1(M0dd, MOdt)’ (8)
N123LM = p2(Modd), (9)
N§LM = P3(M0dt)- (10)

where P1 gives the predicted interactions between existing drug candi-
dates and existing target candidates, P2 are predicted interactions between
existing drug candidates and new target candidates and P3 gives
predicted interactions between new drug candidates and existing target
candidates.

For any classiﬁer that is used, the known targets of d,- corresponding to
non-zero elements of a; and the pairwise target similarity Sl are critical to
the ﬁnal prediction of [73. The model learned for d,- describes how this
drug selects targets. Once the model is learned, the similarities between
the query target and those known targets of d,- largely decide [7%. Similarly,
known targeting drugs of t, or non-zero elements of tj’s interaction proﬁle
a, and the pairwise drug similarity Sd are critical to the ﬁnal prediction of
 Under the same BLM framework, different results are produced due
to the differences in Sd, St, the classiﬁer and the combination function g.
According to the study of Laarhoven et al. (2011), network-based

similarity which encodes the topology information of the interaction net-
work has been shown to provide good results. With the Gaussian kernel,
the network-based drug similarity $3 and network-based target similarity
Sf, are calculated as:

i/

where the bandwidth y 2 yo *ﬁZLl a3, and different bandwidths may
be used for drug and target, respectively. However, the result with
network-based similarity may not remain good when the information
contained in the interaction network is not sufficient enough. Rather
than considering one type of similarity, a more general way is to combine
several types of similarities. Here, we use both the network-based simi-
larity and chemical similarity for drug similarity Sd, and the
network-based similarity and sequence similarity for target similarity Sl

through linear combination:

Sd =aSS+(1—a)sg, (13)

52031") = exp( ), (12)

st=as§+(1—a)S§,, (14)

where Sf is the chemical structure similarity for drug, S", is the amino acid
sequence similarity for protein and or is the combination weight set by
user. Although more sophisticated ways such as Kronecker product
may be used to combine two types of similarity matrices or kernel
matrices, experimental results in (Laarhoven et al. 2011) show that the
linear combination gives comparable performance with a much lower
computational complexity.

2.3 Neighbor-based interaction-proﬁle inferring

Good performance of supervised learning is largely dependent on the
amount and quality of labeled training data. When a drug/target candi-
date is new, it has no existing interactions that can be used as label
information and the model for this candidate thus can not be learned.
As shown in (7), interactions between new drug candidates and new
target candidates remain unpredicted in BLM. To extend the application
domain of BLM to new drug/target candidates, we propose to derive
training data from their neighbors. Based on the assumption that
drugs/compounds which are similar to each other interact with the
same targets, interaction proﬁle for new drug-candidate compounds
could be possibly inferred from their neighbors’ interactions.
Compounds with large similarities to the new drug-candidate compound
are said to be its neighbors. Since new drug-candidate compounds have
no interactions, or all the elements of its current interaction proﬁle vector
are 0, it is not suitable to consider network-based similarity here, so only
chemical structure similarity is used to deﬁne the neighbors of a
drug-candidate compound. Formally, for a compound d,- which is a
new drug-candidate, we infer the j-th dimension of its interaction proﬁle
1%) with

1,40) = Z stat, (15)
11:1

where sih is the chemical similarity between two compounds d,- and dh. The
above formula shows that the interaction weight of this drug with respect
to the j-th target is the collection of its neighbors’ interactions to this
target. For a given new drug-candidate compound, the simple formula
given in Equation (15) deﬁnes that the inferred weight of interaction
between this compound and a target is high if many of its neighbors
interact with this target, and also it is decided more by neighbors with
large similarities than those with small similarities. Since new
target-candidate proteins have no interactions with any compound, the

Bipartite model for learning from local information and neighbors

 

inferred interactions for d,- are only with existing target candidates. To be
more speciﬁc, [1910) > 0 if the j—th target candidate is an existing one, i.e.
ah,>0 for at least one h, and 1,910) = 0 if the j-th target candidate is
new, i.e. ah,=0 for all h. To ensure the value of each [1910) is in the
range of [0, 1], linear scale is performed subsequently, i.e.
[191(i) = ([1910) — minh [2(i))/(maxh [2(i) — minh 12(0). After we obtained
the inferred interaction proﬁle, we can use it as label information to
learn the model of d,:

Modg,(i) = train(St, ld(i)). (16)

In the same way, this procedure is applied to a new target-candidate
protein t, to obtain its inferred interaction proﬁle ll(j), where its neighbors
are deﬁned based on sequence similarity. The model of t, can then be
learned with P0):

Mod1(j) = train(Sd, 1(1)). (17)

This interaction proﬁle inferring technique is particularly useful for
those new drug/target candidates, for which existing supervised methods
(e. g. BLM) fail to produce reasonable predictions. It can also be useful to
enhance the classiﬁcation models for any compounds/proteins without
enough training data or label information.

2.4 BLM with NH

By integrating the above presented NII strategy into the BLM frame-
work, we have the BLM with NII (BLMiNII). The detailed steps of
BLMiNII to predict the probability 17,-, between any compound i and
any protein 1' is described in Algorithms 1 and 2.

 

Algorithm 1: BLMiNII

input : A, Sf, S",

output: 17,-,

get 173 = NII-integrated Learning and Prediction ( A, Sf, 81) from d,-;
get 171., = NII-integrated Learning and Prediction ( A, 81, Sf) from t,;
Combine 173. and 171., to get the ﬁnal result 17,-,- = g(173, 171.1.)

 

 

 

Algorithm 2: NII-integrated learning and prediction
input : A, Sf, S",
output: 173.
if d,- is new then
1 obtain 14(1) with Eq. (15) with sf
else
1 ld(i) is the i-th row of A
end
Compute S, with Eq. (12) and S’ with Eq. (14);
Learn a local model for d,-, i.e., Modd(i) = train(S’, ld(i)) ;
if t, is new then
1 predict 173 with Modd(i) and S",
else
1 predict 173 with Modd(i) and 8’
end

 

 

The output network of BLMiNII is expressed as

N113LM7NII N123LM7NII
NBLMrNH = NBLMiNII NELMiNII ’ (18)
with
N113LM7NII : N113LM, (19)

NIELM’NH = P2(Modd, Mod1), (20)
N§LM’NH = P3(Mod;,, Mod,), (21)
NELM’NH = P4(Modg,, Mod1). (22)

Comparing NBLNFNH and NBLM, it is observed that the interactions be-
tween existing drug candiates and target candiates are the same for the
two approaches, while the interactions in the other three cases in BLMi
NII are different from those in BLM. First, BLMiNII is able to predict
P4, the interactions between drug candidates and target candidates that
are both new. Second, P2 and P3 in BLMiNII are predicted from both
the drug side and the target side, while in BLM are predicted only from
one side.

Learning from neighbors allows drug/target candidates to obtain
labeled data when themselves do not have or have insufﬁcient labeled
data for training. This procedure actually introduces some degree of glo-
balization into the original local model to provide more chances of learn-
ing from known knowledge. However, too much globalization is not
desired as it could eliminate the local characteristics and make the
models of individual candidates less discriminative. Moreover, the low
quality of neighbors due to imprecise similarity measure may cause nega-
tive impact when the learning process replies on too much neighbors’
information. In other words, the inferred interaction proﬁle, although
is helpful, may introduce a certain amount of noise. Therefore, in this
study, we only activate the neighbor-based learning for totally new can-
didates. For other cases, we still train the model locally with its own
known interactions.

3 MATERIALS

To facilitate comparison with published approaches, we used the
same groups of four datasets which are ﬁrst analyzed by
Yamanishi et al. (2008) and then later by Bleakley and
Yamanishi (2009), Xia et al. (2010), Laarhoven et al. (2011)
and Cheng et al. (2012). These four datasets correspond to
drugitarget interactions of four important categories of protein
targets, namely enzyme, ion channel, G-protein—coupled receptor
(GPCR) and nuclear receptor, respectively. The datasets were
downloaded from http://web.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/supp/yoshi/
drugtarget/.

Table 1 gives some statistics of each dataset including the total
number of drugs (nd), the total number of targets (n,), the total
number of interactions (E), the average number of targets for
each drug (Dd), the average number of targeting drugs for each
target (D_,), the percentage of drugs that have only one target
(Dd: l) and the percentage of targets that have one targeting
drug (D,= 1). It is shown from this table that among the four
drugitarget interaction networks, on average, each drug and
target in ion channel and enzyme have more interactions than
those in GPCR and nuclear receptor. It is also worthy noting
that in the leave-one-out crossivalidation (LOOCV), drugs and
targets with one interaction are ‘new candidates’ as the only one
interaction is covered over to leave no recorded interaction, e. g.
72% drugs in the nuclear receptor are ‘new candidates’ in the
simulation.

Each dataset is described by three types of information in the
form of three matrices: (i) the drugitarget interaction matrix; (ii)
the drugwlrug similarity matrix and (iii) the targetitarget simi-
larity matrix. The interaction networks were retrieved from the
KEGG BRITE (Kanehisa et al., 2006), BRENDA (Schomburg

(Wishart et al., 2008). The drugwlrug similarity is measured
based on chemical structures from the DRUG and
COMPOUND sections in the KEGG LIGAND database
(Kanehisa et al., 2006). The chemical structure similarities be-
tween drugs are computed with SIMCOMP (Hattori et al.,
2003), which uses a graph alignment algorithm to get a global
similarity score based on the size of the common substructures
between two compounds. The targetitarget similarity is mea-
sured based on the amino acid sequences retrieved from the
KEGG GENES database (Kanehisa et al., 2006). The sequence
similarities between proteins are computed with a normalized
version of SmithiWaterman score. More details on how the
data have been collected and calculated are given in Yamanishi
et al. (2008).

4 EVALUATION

Systematic experiments are performed to evaluate the perform-
ance of the presented approach with datasets summarized in
Table 1. As in Laarhoven et al. (2011), LOOCV is performed.
Since the real interaction to be predicted is left out, compounds
and proteins with one interaction (i.e. Dd: 1 or D,= 1) turn out
to have no training data and thus they are treated as ‘new can-
didates’ in the cross-validation. To test the robustness of the
presented approach, we also performed 10-fold cross-validation.
The results of 10 trials 10-fold cross-validation can be found in
Tables S&S8 of the Supplementary Material.

4.1 Compare with state-of—the-art approaches

First, we compare the performance of BLMiNII (g=max,
01:05) with the weighted proﬁle method Wamanishi et al.,
2008) and two other state-of—the-art approaches (Bleakley and
Yamanishi, 2009) and (Laarhoven et al., 2011) denoted as BY
(2009) and Laarhoven et al. (2011), respectively. The same RLS
classiﬁer is used for BLMiNII as Laarhoven et al. (2011). We
measure the quality of the predicted interactions in terms of
AUC curve (or true-positive rate versus false-positive rate
curve) and AUPR curve.

Table 2 gives the AUC and AUPR scores of the four
approaches for the four datasets. The results of BY (2009) and
Laarhoven et al. (2011) are the best ones reported in Bleakley
and Yamanishi (2009) and Laarhoven et al. (2011), respectively.
From this table, it is clear that BLMiNII outperforms the other

three for all the datasets. Since the results of weighted proﬁle are
much worse than those of the three BLM-based methods namely
BY (2009), Laarhoven et al. (2011) and BLMiNII, we now focus
on the comparison of these three approaches. As been discussed
in Laarhoven et al. (2011), by incorporating the network-based
similarity, the performance of BLM can be improved, i.e. the
results of Laarhoven et al. (2011) in terms of AUPR are much
better than those of BY (2009). It is also shown that the per-
formance of BLM can further be improved by integrating the
N11 procedure, i.e. the results of BLMiNII is consistently better
than those of Laarhoven et al. (2011).

It is interesting to observe that different levels of improve-
ments have been achieved for different datasets. Comparing
Laarhoven et al. (2011) and BY (2009), the improvement is the
most signiﬁcant on ion channel and the least significant on nu-
clear receptor. Differently, comparing BLMiNII and Laarhoven
et al. (2011), the improvement is the largest for nuclear receptor
and the least for ion channel. Such kind of differences are ex-
pected due to the differences in the structure of the datasets.
From Table 1, it is shown that among the four datasets, the
average numbers of interactions of each drug and target are
the largest for ion channel and the smallest for nuclear receptor.
This means that the interaction network of ion channel contains
more information than nuclear receptor and thus the
network-based similarity of ion channel is more robust and in-
formative than that of nuclear receptor. Therefore, incorporating
the network-based similarity results in larger improvement for
ion channel. Since drugs or targets with one interaction are ‘new
candidates’ in the simulation, it is also shown from Table 1 that
the nuclear receptor contains the largest portion of ‘new candi-
dates’ while the ion channel contains the least. Thus, by applying
the NII procedure, BLMiNII has more chances to improve the
results for nuclear receptor than for Ion Channel.

4.2 Comparison between BLM and BLM—N11

To directly show the improvements attributed to the N11 strat-
egy, we now compare BLMiNII and BLM, i.e. the results of

BLMiNII where new candidates are treated as existing ones. We
applied both BLM and BLMiNII with three different groups of
inputs by setting a in Equations (13) and (14) to l, 0 and 0.5.

We obtained the AUC and AUPR scores of both methods
with g=max. The results of both with g: average or mean
have also been produced, which can be found in Tables S17S4
of the Supplementary Material. Since the same conclusion can be
drawn with respect to either of the two metrics, we put the AUC
scores in the Supplementary Material and plot the AUPR scores
of BLM and BLMiNII for the four datasets with three different
types of similarities in Figure 2. It is shown that for any type of
similarities, BLMiNII performs better than BLM for all the
datasets. Again, the improvements made by BLMiNII are
more significant for nuclear receptor and GPCR than for the
other two datasets.

Now using nuclear receptor, we make further comparison of
the performance between BLM and BLMiNII. Figure 3 plots

the precisionirecall curve of BLM and BLMiNII. Table 3 shows
the sensitivity (or recall), PPV (positive predictive value or pre-
cision) and MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient). The two
groups of results in Table 3 are calculated by considering the
1% and 3% pairs with the highest 17,-, values as positive, respect-
ively. It is clearly shown from these results that with NII being
integrated, the performance of BLM has been improved.

4.3 Detailed analysis of the effectiveness of N11

To take a close look at the difference in the results attributed to
the NII strategy, we now compare those top ranked interactions
of the nuclear receptor dataset produced by BLMiNII and
BLM. Since this dataset has 90 known interactions, we inspect
the 90 interactions with the highest probabilities predicted by
each algorithm.

As summarized in Table 4 (More detailed results are in Table
S11 of the Supplementary Material), among the top 90 predicted
interactions, BLM only correctly detected 58 known interactions
while BLMiNII detected 71, and 57 known interactions are
ranked within 90 by both. Although one interaction detected
by BLM is missed by BLMiNII, this one ranks 104 in BLMi
NII, which indicates that this pair is still recognized to be inter-
acting with a highly possibility by BLMiNII. Nevertheless, 14
interactions detected by BLMiNII are missed by BLM. The
average rank of these 14 interactions produced by BLM is 388
as some of them ranks very low.

Among these 14 drugitarget pairs, three pairs namely D00163
(Chenodeoxycholic acid) 7 hsa997l (nuclear receptor subfamily
1, group H, member 4), D00506 (Phenobarbital) i hsa9970

brighter the more possible that the pair interacts. Three pairs are circled in
(b). These three pairs which consist of drug candidate and protein candi-
date that are both ‘new’ in Loo validation are detected by BLMiNII

 

(nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group 1, member 3) and D05341
[Palmitic acid (NF)] 7 hsa3174 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4,
gamma), which are assigned extremely low ranks by BLM are
successfully detected by BLMiNII as shown in Figure 4. After
checking, we ﬁnd that the query drug D00163 of the ﬁrst pair
only has one target which happens to be the query target
hsa9971, and the query target is known to be only interacting
with the query drug. The other two pairs have the same situation
as this pair. As we left out the true interaction in our simulation,
the testing for these three pairs becomes to predict interaction
between new drug-candidate compound and new target-
candidate protein. Since training data are absent for both the
query drug and query target, BLM fails to detect interactions
for those three pairs. Although difﬁculty is presented for such
kind of cases, BLMiNII successfully detected these three pairs to
be interacting. This shows the effectiveness of NII for prediction
of interaction involving new candidates.

Now using D00163 and hsa997l as an example, we give inter-
mediate results to illustrate how NII helps detect the interactions
between new drug-candidate compounds and new target-
candidate proteins. Figure 5 shows the local model learned for
D00163 with the help of inferred training data. Specifically,
Figure 5a shows the inferred interaction proﬁle of D00163, i.e.
the weighted interactions between D00163 and 25 non-query tar-
gets calculated with Equation (15). It shows that the associations
between D00163 and several targets such as hsa2099 are large.
This is because many of D00163’s neighbors or similar drugs,
such as D00066, interact with this target as seen from Figure 5b.
Using this inferred interaction profile as label information,
Figure Sc shows the learned local model of D00163, or the
weight of each of the targets learned with the classiﬁer with re-
spect to D00163. With this learned model, BLMiNII successfully
detected the interaction between D00163 and hsa997l based on
the similarities between the query target hsa997l and other tar-
gets especially those with large weights in the model of D00163.
In the same manner, the local model of the query target which is
a ‘new’ candidate can be learned with NII. This example illus-
trates the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented approach
to infer training data or label information from the interaction
proﬁles of neighbors.

of BLM by integrating a NII procedure, i.e. infer training data

Bipartite model for learning from local information and neighbors

 

from neighbors’ interaction proﬁles. Through systematic
experiments with benchmark datasets, we demonstrated the
effectiveness of BLMiNII for predicting interactions between
new drug-candidate compounds and new target-candidate
proteins.

In the presented approach, we allow all the neighbors to par-
ticipate in training data inferring. To allow only neighbors with
large similarities to contribute, a threshold may be used to reduce
the impact of those non-important neighbors to 0. Alternately, a
Gaussian function may be introduced to gradually decrease the
inﬂuence of neighbors based on their distances to the new drug/
target candidate in query.

In the current work, we only apply the NII procedure for those
completely new candidates that have no existing training data at
all, and we find that the results are already good enough to show
the usefulness of NII. Since it is quite common that drugs only
activate or inhibit a small number of targets and targets are only
activated or inhibited by very limited drugs, the N11 procedure
may be applied to drugs and targets which do not have sufﬁcient
training data. We expect that more accurate prediction models
may be build by using neighbors’ information to enhance the
limited training examples. However, too much emphasis on
neighbors tends to eliminate the local characteristics of each
drug and target and could cause deterioration in the prediction
performance. Nevertheless, it would be an interesting future
work to explore the balance between local information and
global information in model learning.

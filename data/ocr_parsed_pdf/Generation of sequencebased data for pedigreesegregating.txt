Abstract

Motivation: There is great interest in analyzing next generation sequence data that has been gener—
ated for pedigrees. However, unlike for population—based data there are only a limited number of
rare variant methods to analyze pedigree data. One limitation is the ability to evaluate type | and II
errors for family—based methods, due to lack of software that can simulate realistic sequence data
for pedigrees.

Summary: We developed RarePedSim (Rare—variant Pedigree—based Simulator), a program to
simulate region/gene—level genotype and phenotype data for complex and Mendelian traits for any
given pedigree structure. Using a genetic model, sequence variant data can be generated either
conditionally or unconditionally on pedigree members’ qualitative or quantitative phenotypes.
Additionally, qualitative or quantitative traits can be generated conditional on variant data.
Sequence data can either be simulated using realistic population demographic models or obtained
from sequence—based studies. Variant sites can be annotated with positions, allele frequencies and
functionality. For rare variants, RarePedSim is the only program that can efficiently generate both
genotypes and phenotypes, regardless of pedigree structure. Data generated by RarePedSim are in
standard Linkage file (.ped) and Variant Call (.vcf) formats, ready to be used for a variety of pur—
poses, including evaluation of type I error and power, for association methods including mixed
models and linkage analysis methods.

1 Introduction

 

Currently, there is great interest in analyzing next generation se-
quence (NGS) data generated for pedigrees. For Mendelian traits,
gene identification is far from complete (Antonarakis and
Beckmann, 2006) and performing linkage analysis can greatly in-
crease the ability to identify causal variants (Ott et (11., 2015). For
complex traits, pedigree-based studies differ from population-based
design, i.e. better control of population stratification (Bansal et (11.,
2010) and potentially more powerful to detect associations, particu-
larly for rare variants, due to causal allele enrichment (Ott et (11.,

2011). However, only a limited number of methods have been de-
veloped to analyze pedigree sequence data, e.g. extended FBAT mul-
timarker test (De et (11., 2013), RV-TDT (He et (11., 2014),
SEQLinkage (Wang et (11., 2015). One bottleneck is the lack of avail-
able software to realistically generate rare variant pedigree data, to
evaluate type I error, to compare statistical power of association and
linkage methods and aid in the design of studies through the evalu-
ation of sample size for sufficient power.

Although there are a number of programs that simulate common
variants for pedigrees, they are not useful for NGS association and

linkage studies. Currently, only SimRare (Li et 41., 2012) and
SeqSIMLA (Chung and Shih, 2013) can simulate sequence—based
genotype and phenotype data for rare variants. However, their focus
is on generating data for unrelated individuals. Although SeqSIMLA
can also generate sequence data for pedigrees, it is strictly limited to
complex traits and a three—generational family structure with a fixed
number of individuals per generation.

RarePedSim was developed to simulate region/gene—level geno—
type data and phenotypes for complex and Mendelian pedigrees, re—
gardless of structure. To evaluate type I error, variant data can be
generated using Mendelian segregation independent of the pheno—
type data. For evaluating power, where the trait is linked/associated
with causal variant(s), variant data are generated conditional on the
phenotypes. For Mendelian traits, mode of inheritance, penetrance
and phenocopies are incorporated in the model; for complex
traits an odds ratio model is implemented, while for quantitative
traits a linear model is used. Phenotype data for Mendelian, complex
and quantitative traits can also be generated conditional on
the simulated variant data. RarePedSim output files are in standard
Linkage and VCF formats. RarePedSim can generate data with al—
lelic and locus heterogeneity as well as with errors and missing
genotypes.

2 Description

2.1 Generation of variant data

RarePedSim uses forward—time simulation (Peng and Liu, 2011) to
generate region/gene—based variant data that incorporates haplotype
information. Forward—time simulation is superior to other methods,
e.g. coalescent, since it can incorporate realistic evolutionary scen—
arios that consist of multi—stage demography with varying popula—
tion sizes, variant—specific selection coefficients and multi—locus
fitness effects. Variant data for populations, including African and
European can be generated using state—of—the—art demographic and
purifying selection models (Gazave et al., 2013). The simulated vari—
ant data are diallelic and each site is represented by: minor allele fre—
quency (MAF), selection coefficient and genomic position, which
are used to generate haplotypes. Variant data information can also
be obtained from exome or genome sequence data from genetic epi—
demiological studies e.g. NHLBI—Exome Sequencing Project or data—
bases e.g. ExAC.

2.2 Generation of pedigree segregating

data for Mendelian Trait

For Mendelian trait studies, phenotypes are usually known for pedi—
gree structures. Thus, to generate variants which are linked with the
phenotype status, of which only some may be causal, genotypes are
simulated conditional on observed phenotypic data by incorporating
a user—specified penetrance (complete or reduced) model and variant
data information, e.g MAF, rate of recombination and purifying se—
lection coefficients. To simulate genotypes, the pedigree is first split
into nuclear family block(s) connected by joining individuals (JIs),
who are non—founders with offspring. Starting with the founders,
within each nuclear family block, the conditional genotypic likeli—
hoods are calculated for each pedigree member. Then based upon
the joint likelihoods of the JIs the conditional genotype likelihoods
are updated for all pedigree members and genotypes are assigned
starting with the JIs. Additionally, phenotypes can be generated for
all pedigree members conditional on simulated variants and user—
specified penetrance models.

2.3 Generation of pedigree segregating

data for Complex Trait

Within a region which is associated with a phenotype, generated
variants can increase or decrease risk, modulate quantitative pheno—
types or have no effect on phenotype (non—causal). For a qualitative
phenotype a logistic odds ratio (LOGIT) model is used. For a quanti—
tative trait (QT) linear mean—shift model (LNR) is incorporated,
where baseline QT follows a standard Gaussian distribution and
contribution of functional variants alters the QT distribution by a
shift in the mean. To efficiently simulate genotype data conditional
on observed phenotypes, the users can specify either a LOGIT or
LNR model. The same strategy as described for Mendelian trait is
used to simulate genotypes conditional on phenotypes for complex
trait, with penetrance derived from the effect size of causal variants
(odds ratio in LOGIT model and mean shift in LNR model).
Additionally, phenotypes can be generated conditional on genotypes
and disease/phenotypic model (LOGIT or LNR), where for each in—
dividual the probability of being affected is obtained for a qualita—
tive trait or the continuous probability distribution for a
quantitative trait and either an affection status or a QT value is as—
signed, respectively.

2.4 Software overview

Benchmarks were performed on a 64—bit Linux machine with Intel
Core i7—4770k 3.5 GHz CPU and 16GB RAM. Using a population
demographic model described by Gazave et al. (2013) it took
1.7 minutes to simulate a pool of 1 308 000 haplotypes of 1800 bp in
length. Sampling from the haplotype pool, conditional on disease
phenotypes it took per replicate 2.9 seconds to generate two suscep—
tibility genes for a 57 member autosomal dominant pedigree with
reduced penetrance and 3.25 using a LOGIT fixed effect model to
generate a disease associated gene for 2000 complex trait trios.

One of important applications of RarePedSim is to perform
power analysis. For examples, a gene with 65 causal rare variant
sites (average MAF : 0.14%) was generated: 1) for a Mendelian dis—
ease, variants were generated using an autosomal dominant model
with 45% penetrance and 5% phenocopy rate for 562 nuclear fami—
lies with 2—6 offspring and 1235 affected individuals in total and 2)
for a complex trait, with 1% prevalence, variants were generated
under a LOGIT model using an odds ratio of 2.5 to simulate data
for 2000 trios. For each study 1000 replicates were generated. The
Mendelian trait data was analyzed using parametric linkage analysis
by implementing SEQLINKAGE and the estimated power was 78%.
For the trios, association analysis was performed using RV—TDT
and the estimated power was 65%.

3 Conclusion

RarePedSim is written in Python and C++ and provides a user—
friendly command—line interface. The program provides key func—
tionalities to generate region/gene—based genotype pedigree data
conditional or unconditional on phenotypes. The generated data are
ready to be used for evaluating type I and II errors for both family—
based association methods, including mixed models, and parametric
and nonparametric linkage methods. RarePedSim can be used by re—
searchers to efficiently generate pedigree variant data without hav—
ing to develop special software. Ultimately RarePedSim will
facilitate the development of novel methods to analyze rare variant

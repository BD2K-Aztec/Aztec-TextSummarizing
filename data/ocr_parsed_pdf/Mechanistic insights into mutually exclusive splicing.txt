sites. Moreover, both elements can form significantly stable base—
pairing (AG 2 —30.8 kcal/mol; z score = —3.34, calculated from
the background energy distribution) (Fig. 1C). Some sites that
were not strictly conserved were not complementary with each
other when the elements formed a speciﬁc RNA secondary struc—
ture, which also supports the functional importance of these
elements during base—pairing. Overall, these features strongly
suggest that RNA pairing between the two conserved elements
observed in dnm] in mammals directs the choice of the mutually
exclusive exons. This is the ﬁrst clear evidence of the existence of
this mechanism in mammals, which suggests that this is a widely
used mechanism for mutually exclusive splicing in bilaterian
animals.

3.3 Proposed model for the regulation of mutually
exclusive splicing in dnm1

Based on the sequence features of dnm], a model is proposed for
the regulation of mutually exclusive splicing, which is analogous
to that observed in mutually exclusive splicing events in insects
(Anastassiou et (11., 2006; Graveley, 2005; Yang et (11., 2011)
(Fig. 2). According to this model, mutually exclusive splicing is
accomplished by competition between the formation of a speciﬁc
RNA secondary structure via the complementary sequence elem—
ents and binding of a repressor protein (Fig. 2). However, what is
the identity of the trans—factor that acts as a repressor during the
regulation of mutually exclusive splicing? In case of the Dscam
exon 6 cluster in Drosophila, Hrp36 is the factor that ensures
ﬁdelity of the mutually exclusive choice of exon 6 (Olson et (11.,
2007). Thus, the corresponding human homolog, hnRNP A1
(Zu et (11., 1998), which is known to repress splicing by binding
to pre—mRNAs (Smith and Valcarcel, 2000), may be the trans—
factor involved with regulation of mutually exclusive splicing in
dnm]. Another possible factor may be the Fox—1/Fox—2 splicing
regulator, which is known to act as an activator and repressor
during exon skipping (Zhang et (11., 2008). The 5’—residues of the
selector sequence (AGCAUG) were highly similar to the Fox
protein recognition sequence (UGCAUG) (Underwood et (11.,
2005), and binding to the site may directly prevent the pre—
mRNA from forming speciﬁc base—pairing, thereby inactivating

exon 10a inclusion. This is also supported by the fact that dnm]
and fox—I/fox—Z are both highly expressed in the nervous system
(Powell and Robinson, 1995; Underwood et (11., 2005).

The involvement of Fox proteins in mutually exclusive exon
selection in dnm] was analyzed further using the CLIP—seq data
obtained for Fox—2 (Yeo et (11., 2009). CLIP—seq is used to iden—
tify transcriptome—wide interactions among RNA—binding
proteins and targets RNAs using cross—linking immunoprecipita—
tion coupled with massively parallel sequencing (Yeo et al.,
2009). The Fox—2 CLIP—seq data were downloaded from the
UCSC genome browser (the ‘FOX2 CLIP—seq’ track)
(Dreszer et al., 2012) and analyzed by counting the sequence
reads mapped on each gene locus. Among the total of
4418213 CLIP—seq reads, 825 reads mapped on the dnm]
locus, and dnm] was ranked among the top 3% of the total
genes (729th of 26 570 genes; P< 0.0001, Poisson distribution)
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This also supported the involvement
of Fox proteins in the mutually exclusive selection of the exons in
dnm], and it also reinforced the proposed model, which is ex—
plained by the competition between the formation of speciﬁc
base—pairing and binding of a splicing regulator.

3.4 Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that the
regulatory elements are speciﬁc invention in
mammalian lineage

To obtain insights into the molecular evolutionary process
underlying the emergence of this elaborate mechanism for mu—
tually exclusive splicing, a phylogenetic analysis was performed
using homologous sequences from several species. Each mamma—
lian species had three closely related dynamins (dnml, dnm2 and
dnmj‘), whereas Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila each
appeared to have only one dynamin (van der Bliek, 1999). The
phylogenetic relationships among the dynamins indicated that
the expansion of dynamin paralogs occurred in the common an—
cestor of mammals (Fig. 3). Pairs of mutually exclusive exons
were observed only in mammalian dnm] and dnm2, and were
absent from all other dynamins (Boumil et al., 2010).
According to the phylogenetic tree, dnm2 and dnmj‘ were closer
to each other than to dnm]. This suggests that exon duplication
occurred in the common ancestor of mammals, and then dnmj‘

lost one of the duplicated exons; otherwise, multiple independent
duplication would be required to explain the observed presence/
absence pattern in the mutually exclusive exons. The complemen—
tary sequence elements were observed only in dnm1 in mammals.
This can be explained by the loss of sequence elements in (lan or
by the emergence in dnm1. Both possibilities suggest that these
sequence elements independently evolved in the mammalian lin—
eage and not in the bilaterian ancestor.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Recently, it has been reported that long—range RNA structures
are important for the regulation of splicing in mammals and that
a mechanism based on docking site—selector sequence pairing
may be present in mammalian genes (Pervouchine et al, 2012).
To the best of my knowledge, this is the ﬁrst example of a pos—
sible regulatory mechanism facilitated by docking site—selector
sequence pairing during the precise selection of mutually exclu—
sive exons in a mammalian lineage. A direct experimental proof
is still required, but the lines of evidence presented in this study
suggest that the regulatory mechanism responsible for mutually
exclusive splicing is also present in dnm1 in mammals. This mech—
anism was ﬁrst proposed in the exon 6 cluster of Dscam in insects
(Anastassiou et al, 2006; Graveley, 2005). A molecular evolu—
tionary study of Dscam homologs revealed that the regulatory
mechanism exists only in arthropods, and that this was not be—
cause of its loss in other bilaterian species but because it had
independently evolved in arthropods (Brites et al, 2008), which
is the phylogenetic pattern opposite to that proposed for the
dynamins presented in this study. Thus, although mutually ex—
clusive splicing is regulated the same way in dnm1 in mammals
and Dscam in arthropods, neither gene had a common ancestral
gene with the same regulatory mechanism, which suggests that
this type of regulation may be a result of mechanistic conversion.
Convergent evolution of gene structures has often been observed
in mutually exclusive exons (Copley, 2004). The example pre—
sented here indicates that convergence also occurs at the mech—
anistic level of mutually exclusive splicing where distinct genes in
different clades have independently evolved the same mechanism
of regulation to achieve the precise selection of mutually exclu—
sive exons.

ABSTRACT

Summary: CytoscapeRPC is a plugin for Cytoscape which allows
users to create, query and modify Cytoscape networks from any
programming language which supports XML-RPC. This enables
them to access Cytoscape functionality and visualize their data
interactively without leaving the programming environment with
which they are familiar.

Availability: Install through the Cytoscape plugin manager or visit the
web page: http://wiki.nbic.nl/index.php/CytoscapeRPC for the user
tutorial and download.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cytoscape (Shannon et (11., 2003) is a network visualization and
analysis tool which is mainly used in the life sciences. It enables
users to display the data as graphs and helps them to perform
basic actions such as gathering network-topological statistics. It
comes with its own plugin management system to facilitate the easy
implementation of new functionality.

Researchers in the life sciences often use scripting languages to
process their data and use Cytoscape to visualize it. Their workﬂow
when using Cytoscape comes down to running their algorithm,
converting the output data such that Cytoscape can use it, loading
the data into Cytoscape and then setting the appropriate layout and
visualization rules to control how the data is displayed. The last three
steps of this process are repetitive and time consuming.

We present CytoscapeRPC, a Cytoscape plugin created to
solve the aforementioned problems by enabling users to create
a connection to Cytoscape using XML-RFC, allowing them to
create, modify and query Cytoscape networks from within their own
programming environment.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

CytoscapeRPC builds on top of the Cytoscape libraries. making these
components easily accessible. Nodes. edges and networks e. g. can be
accessed through their human-readable identiﬁers. Attributes for these
components can be created. queried and modiﬁed. They can also be linked to
visual mappers. For example. the user can perform a mapping from molecule
type (receptor. ligand) to the shape of a node (triangle. square) or. by using the
P-value of an interaction. change the colour of the edges between molecules.

Fig. 1. CytoscapeRPC design. The plugin is split up into a function
(handlers). a translation (call handler) and a communication layer. These
layers ensure that the API can be kept stable.

Layouts can be applied or the positions of nodes can be set manually by
specifying the x- and y-coordinates.

The plugin uses XML-RPC (Winer. 1999). a communication protocol
which uses XML to transfer messages between client and server applications.
It allows programs written in different programming languages and running
on different machines to communicate by passing messages which perform
function calls. XML-RPC was chosen based on the relative simplicity of
the protocol which ensures that server and client libraries are available for
virtually every programming language (e.g. Perl. Python. Ruby etc.). thus
giving access to Cytoscape through those languages.

The user can specify whether the plugin should be started on Cytoscape
start-up and on which port the XML-RPC server should listen for incoming
calls. This can be used to run Cytoscape on headless (i.e. non-GUI)
computers.

The XML-RPC service normally listens to any incoming call. To limit
access to the plugin. the XML-RPC security mode has been implemented.
The user can request the plugin to only allow incoming calls from processes
running on the same computer as Cytoscape itself.

The plugin exposes the CyCommand API which was created to share
functionality between Cytoscape plugins. Through CytoscapeRPC. the
user can access this functionality and control third party plugins. Plugin
developers can use the CyCommand functionality and CytoscapeRPC to
easily share their work with other programmers.

2.1 Plugin design

The plugin consists of and relies on a number of components. as shown in
Figure l. The different components are explained from top to bottom:

(1) Cytoscape and its libraries.

(2) Handler classes: classes which provide abstract functions to
Cytoscape. Classes have been implemented for nodes. edges.
networks. layouts. vizmappers etc. Their functionality consists of
translating basic data types such as numbers and strings that can be

Fig. 2. Example Python session for creating a network using CytoscapeRPC. Setup: initializing the XMLRPC library of Python and creating a connection
to the server. Network & nodes: creating a network with the title ‘Test network” and adding three nodes. ‘a’. ‘b’ and ‘c’. Edges & layout: adding three edges
to the network and performing the ‘force directed” layout. Attributes: Adding attributes to nodes and edges. Note that two errors were introduced: for one
node no ‘type’ was speciﬁed and the edge from node ‘c’ to node ‘a’ got a ‘P-value’ of 1.2. Node shape: setting the node shape based on the ‘type’ attribute.

A default value has been speciﬁed to give nodes without that attribute a different shape. in this case a square. Edge colour: setting the edge colour based on
the ‘P-value’ attribute. One has to specify between which points the values should be interpolated. Signiﬁcant P-values get a bright red colour while invalid

P-values are either green (lower then zero) or blue (larger then one). Colours are represented with their HTML values.

handled by XML-RPC into Cytoscape objects and to provide abstract
methods to manipulate the Cytoscape environment with.

(3) CallHandler class: class which provides all the functions that are made
available through the external interface. All calls are redirected to the
appropriate functions in the handler classes.

(4) XML-RPC: the Apache library providing the XML-RPC server.

(5) External clients: client code which directly calls or provides abstract
methods for working with Cytoscape.

2.2 Usage examples

An example scenario with Python source code is provided in Figure 2. Other
scenarios which can be found in the documentation include:

0 Loading multiple network (sit). node attribute (noa) and edge attribute
(eda) ﬁles. perform a default layout and set some visual attributes. This
provides a starting point for analysis without having to go through the
manual steps of data loading.

0 Use an external layout algorithm from a package such as iGraph (Csardi
and Nepusz. 2006) to determine the position of nodes. Use the plugin
to transfer the location information to Cytoscape. This ensures that the
computationally expensive network analysis can be performed using
optimized software.

0 Demonstrate network changes by scripting events for Cytoscape. Time
series data of e.g. gene expression can be loaded and used to create
visual representations. While the layout of the network can remain
static. the colours of the nodes (in this case genes) can change based
on their expression values. These different instances of the same
network can be saved to image ﬁles and can be combined by e.g. the
ImageMagick® ‘convert’ tool to create a movie of these changes.

0 Import data from Cytoscape using R. perform an analysis and update
the Cytoscape visualization based on its output.

3 CONCLUSION

CytoscapeRPC allows users to develop applications which leverage
the functionality of Cytoscape without having to leave their
programming environment. This lowers the barrier for people to
start developing their own tools for Cytoscape.

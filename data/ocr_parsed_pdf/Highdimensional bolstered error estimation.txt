ABSTRACT

Motivation: In small-sample settings, bolstered error estimation
has been shown to perform better than cross-validation and
competitively with bootstrap with regard to various criteria. The
key issue for bolstering performance is the variance setting for the
bolstering kernel. Heretofore, this variance has been determined in
a non-parametric manner from the data. Although bolstering based
on this variance setting works well for small feature sets, results can
deteriorate for high-dimensional feature spaces.

Results: This article computes an optimal kernel variance depending
on the classification rule, sample size, model and feature space, both
the original number and the number remaining after feature selection.
A key point is that the optimal variance is robust relative to the model.
This allows us to develop a method for selecting a suitable variance
to use in real-world applications where the model is not known, but
the other factors in determining the optimal kernel are known.

1 INTRODUCTION

Throughout most of the history of pattern recognition, the number
of features was much smaller than the numbers currently being
generated in high-throughput biology. Less than 15 years ago, in
two studies on feature selection most cases considered involved
<30 features and the maximum number considered was 65 (Jain
and Zongker, 1997; Kudo and Sklansky, 2000). The advent of
high-throughput technologies has radically altered the landscape.
In conjunction with large numbers of features, bioinformatics is
confronted by small sample sizes, often <100, which forces one
to train and test on the same data, where bias, variance (Braga—Neto
and Dougherty, 2004b) and lack of correlation with the true error
(Hanczar et (11., 2007, 2010) can severely degrade error estimation.
Performance can degrade even further in the presence of feature
selection (Molinaro et (11., 2005). Recent articles have pointed out
the difﬁculty in establishing performance advantages for proposed
Classiﬁcation rules (Boulesteix, 2010; Jelizarow et (11., 2010; Rocke
et (11., 2009). Two statistically grounded sources of overoptimism
have been highlighted: (i) applying a Classiﬁcation rule to numerous
datasets and then reporting only the results on the dataset for
which the designed Classiﬁer possesses the lowest estimated error

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Youseﬁ et (11., 2010); and (ii) applying multiple Classiﬁcation rules
to a dataset and comparing the Classiﬁcation rules according to
the estimated errors of the designed Classiﬁers (Boulesteix and
Strobl, 2009). In both cases, optimism is a result of inaccurate error
estimation.

A good error estimator ideally would have small bias and small
variance. This is a difﬁcult trade-off in small-sample settings. In
small-sample cases, resubstitution generally has small variance
but tends to be quite optimistically biased. Cross-validation has
small bias, but tends to display high variance. Bolstered error
estimation (Braga—Neto and Dougherty, 2004a) attempts to achieve a
compromise to this bias-variance dilemma in small-sample settings.
It is based on the idea of modifying (‘bolstering’) the empirical
distribution of the data by placing kernels at each data point
and then estimating Classiﬁer error by the error on this bolstered
empirical distribution in such a way that it reduces bias, while at the
same time reducing variance. Bolstered error estimation has shown
good performance when compared with popular error estimators
in small-sample settings, in particular, for feature-set ranking and
when used internally within a feature-selection algorithm (Sima
et (11., 2005a) and for ranking feature sets (Sima et (11., 2005b).
Its good performance, including the latter applications, has been
demonstrated in the context a small number of features, including
feature selection via sequential forward selection (SFS), where it
is applied to small potential feature sets in the SFS algorithm.
A critical aspect of the method is selecting the right amount of
bolstering, which is given by the variance of the bolstering kernels.
The original bolstering paper (Braga-Neto and Dougherty, 2004a)
proposed a non-parametric estimator for the kernel variance, which
was found empirically to perform well in low-dimensional spaces;
however, estimation was found to degrade in high dimensions, so
that a correction factor can be required (Vu and Braga—Neto, 2008).
In fact, it was demonstrated in a preliminary study that a correction
factor can also be beneﬁcial for low-dimensional bolstering (Huynh
et (11., 2007).

This leads us to consider optimal bolstering, speciﬁcally, ﬁnding
an optimal variance for the bolstering kernels. Error estimators like
resubstitution and cross-validation (assuming the number of folds is
preset) are non-parametric. They contain no free parameters. This
is not the case for bootstrap. In general, bootstrap has the form of a
convex error estimator, namely,

ggoot = (1 _ aﬁresub + agzero 7 (l)

where éresub and ézero are the resubstitution and zero-bootstrap
estimators and 03(131. The zero-bootstrap utilizes the empirical
distribution F *, which puts mass % on each of the 11 available

data points. A bootstrap sample S: from F * consists of n equally-
likely draws with replacement from the original data S". The basic
bootstrap zero estimator (Efron, 1983) is written in terms of the
empirical distribution as

€0=EF*(lY—g(S:,X)|:(X,Y)eSn\S:). (2)

In practice, the expectation Em has to be approximated by a
Monte-Carlo estimate based on independent replicates S247, for
b: 1,...,B, in which case the Classiﬁer is designed on the bootstrap
sample and tested on the original data points left out. An optimal
bootstrap estimator results from a value of (1 that minimizes the
mean-square error between égoot and the true error for a given
feature-label distribution (Sima and Dougherty, 2006b). Setting
(1:0.632, as is commonly done (Efron, 1983), can lead to a far
from optimal estimator (optimal weights).

The present article considers optimal bolstering relative to its
one free parameter, kernel variance and the manner in which
optimal bolstering can be used to arrive at practical implementation
of bolstering in high-dimensional feature space. The end product
is an implementation protocol in which optimal kernel variances
across different models are combined to produce a suitable kernel
variance for the problem at hand. Throughout, we will assume
feature selection because that would be the stande way to approach
Classiﬁcation in the high-dimensional setting we are considering,
although this is not a mandatory requirement of the approach.

2 SYSTEMS AND METHODS

This section will be broken into subsections. with the aim of arriving at
the implementation protocol for real-world data. Section 2.1 brieﬂy reviews
the necessary essentials of error estimation. mainly bolstering. Section 2.2
deﬁnes the scaling factor by which to adjust the bolstering kernel to high
dimensions. Section 2.3 discusses optimization of the scaling factor and
illustrates the construction of a set of optimal scaling factors across a family
of models varying in both structure and classiﬁcation difﬁculty. Section 2.4
provides the implementation of high-dimensional bolstered resubstitution
based on a family of optimal scaling factors.

2.1 Error estimation

In two-group statistical pattern recognition. there is a feature vector
XERI’ and a label Ye{0,1}. The pair (X,Y) has a joint probability
distribution F. which is unknown in practice. Hence. a classiﬁer is designed
from training data. which is a set of n independent observations. Sn:
{(X1,Y1),...,(X,,,Y,,)}. drawn from F. A classiﬁcation rule is a mapping
‘11,, : {RP >< {O,1}}” X R” —> T. where J: is the set of mappings from K” into
{0,1}. It maps S” into a classiﬁer tit” :R” —> {0,1}. The classiﬁcation error
8,, is the probability of an erroneous classiﬁcation:

8n=P(wrt(X)7éYlSrt)=EF(lY_wrt(X)l)v (3)

where EF denotes expectation with respect to F. Were F known. then the
error could be found Via Equation (3). In practice. one must use an error
estimator 2:3,. An error estimator can suffer from bias. Bias: E [5,, — an]. and
deviation variance. Vardev =Var[2§,, —8,,]. These combine to contribute to the
most common measure (used herein) for evaluating the accuracy of an error
estimator. the root-mean-square (RMS):

RMS = «Eng, —s,,|2 = j/Val‘dev +Biasz. (4)

2.1.1 Classical error estimation The simplest way to estimate the error
in the absence of independent test data is to compute its error directly on the

sample data itself. This resubstitution estimator. Emub. is usually optimistic
(i.e. biased low). sometimes very much so.
In k-fold cross-validation. the dataset S” is partitioned into k folds
if). for i = 1, . . .,k (for simplicity. we assume that k divides n). Each
fold is left out of the design process and used as a test set. and the
estimate. 56V. is the overall proportion of error on all folds. A k-fold cross-
Validation estimator is unbiased as an estimator of 8,,_,,/k. Cross-validation
estimators are pessimistic. since they use smaller training sets to design
the classiﬁer; however. their bias tends to be small. Their main drawback
is their large variance (Braga-Neto and Dougherty. 2004b; Devroye et al..
1996). Sometimes cross-validation is repeated some number of times with
different fold partitions and the results averaged. In this article. we use
10-fold cross-validation without repetition.

A recently developed estimation method. called adjusted bootstrap (Sam).
which carries out further bootstrap resampling in each fold. has been found
to have good RMS performances (J iang and Simon. 2007). Speciﬁcally. S” is
partitioned into n folds and. for each sample left out for testing. B bootstrap
sample sets of size ln are drawn from the remaining rt — 1 points. 1 = 1,2, . . . ,L.
For each 1. the error e, is the proportion of misclassiﬁed samples across rt
folds and B bootstrap sample sets. Finally. the adjusted bootstrap error Eabg
is computed in the form

gabs 22171—2 +177
where a, b and c are least squares estimates for the function

e, =a(n - u[)_c +1),

and u, is the proportion of the expected number of non-repeated samples in
a size ln bootstrap sample set.

2.1.2 Bolstered error estimation The empirical feature-label distribution
F * is a discrete distribution that puts mass % on each of the n available data
points. The resubstitution estimator can be written in terms of the empirical
feature-label distribution as

Erasub=EF*[lY-1lfrt(X)ll- (5)

Relative to F *. no distinction is made between points near or far from
the decision boundary. If one spreads the probability mass of the empirical
distribution at each point. then variation is reduced because points near the
decision boundary will have more mass on the other side of the boundary
than will points far from the decision boundary. Consider a probability
density function fio. for i=1,...,n. called a bolstering kernel. and deﬁne
the bolstered empirical distribution F O. with probability density function
given by

1 rl
fWX) = Z 21.21 tow—Xi). (6)

The bolstered resubstitution estimator (Braga-Neto and Dougherty.
2004a) is obtained by replacing F * by F O in Equation (5) to obtain

Ebolst=Epo[lY—¢(X)ll- (7)

Bolstering can be applied to other error estimators; however. we only use
bolstered resubstitution. the bolstering method used the most to date.

where Aj = {x | 114x) 2 j}. The integrals are the error contributions made by

the data points. according to whether y, = O or y, = 1. If the classiﬁer is linear.
then the decision boundary is a hyperplane and it is usually possible to ﬁnd

analytical expressions for the integrals; otherwise. Monte-Carlo integration
can be employed.

The amount of bolstering determines the variance and bias properties
(hence. RMS also) of the bolstered estimator. As a general rule. wider
bolstering kernels lead to lower variance estimators. but after a certain point
this advantage becomes offset by increasing pessimistic bias. In the other
direction. insufﬁciently wide kernels tend to result in optimistic bias. A zero-
mean. spherical Gaussian bolstering kernel ff) with covariance matrix of the
form [(121, where I is the identity matrix. has been proposed (Braga-Neto and
Dougherty. 2004a). and has been shown to work well in low-dimensional
feature spaces. Since bolstered estimators spread the test points. the task is
to ﬁnd the amount of spreading that makes the test points to be as close as
possible to the true mean distance to the training data points. The true mean
distance can be estimated by its sample-based estimate:

[3 _ letminj¢illlxi—lel}ilvzy
y_ —.
2:121 [Yi:y

The estimate dy is the mean minimum distance between points belonging

(9)

to class y. Next. let ff’ 1 be a unit-variance bolstering kernel. R, be the random
variable equal to the distance of a point randomly selected from fio’l to the
origin and F RI. (x) be the cumulative distribution function of R». In the case
of the bolstering kernel ff with covariance matrix [(121, all distances get
multiplied by [(1. In Braga-Neto and Dougherty (2004a). a single variance

[(2, is estimated for all points from class y. such that the median distance of a

1
test point to the origin is equal to the estimated true mean distance dy. This
implies that half of the ‘ mass” (i.e. the ‘ test points” ) of the bolstering kernel
will be farther from the center than dy and the other half will be nearer. Hence.
Ky is the solution of the equation KyFI;1(l/2)=[ly. Letting a],=F1;il(1/2).
and recognizing that the R, are identically distributed. the estimated SDs for
the bolstering kernels are given by

Kt=—l. (10)

fori=1,2,...,n.

2.2 High-dimensional bolstered resubstitution

In high-dimensional settings. it is commonplace to perform feature selection
and. when performed. feature selection is part of the classiﬁcation rule. with
the entire set of potential features constituting the feature set relative to the
classiﬁcation rule. Feature selection constrains the space of functions from
which a classiﬁer might be chosen. but it does not reduce the number of
features in the design process. This is why when using cross-validation error
estimation. feature selection has to be carried out in each partitioned fold.

If we perform feature selection on a D-dimensional dataset S5 and arrive
at a d-dimensional set Sill (d < D). then the bolstered error estimator can use
the previously deﬁned kernel size [(1, computed on SE. not Si. Speciﬁcally.
the mean minimum distance dy is estimated on S5 and (11,2010. For high
dimensions. we replace [(1 by

£110
Ky :19; X  (11)

D
where k0 is an additional scaling factor determined by the dimension and
where we have indicated the dimension in the mean minimum distance
estimate. The idea is to adjust the kernel size by choosing k0 so the bolstered
error estimator will be optimal (minimum RMS). k0 = 1 yields the previously
proposed kernel variance. In essence. K1 is a parameter for the bolstered
estimator and Equation (11) sets it free. thereby allowing for optimization.

The situation is akin to 0.632 bootstrap as opposed to optimal bootstrap.

Given the kernel sizes. the bolstered resubstitution error estimate is given
by Equation (8) in D dimensions. For Gaussian kernels with independent
variables. this integral reduces. Let fio’dOr—xi) and in’D_d(x—xi) denote
the Gaussian kernels in d- and (D—d)-dimensional spaces. respectively.

so that the D-dimensional Gaussian kernel decomposes as
1300‘—Xi)=ﬁ<>’d(x—XimO’D_d(X—Xi)- (12>
Denoting x —xi as Axi. then Equation (8) can be rewritten as

where A151,j=0, 1. is the projection of the classiﬁer decision region Aj into
d-dimensional space. and we added a superscript ‘D’ to the bolstered error
estimator to indicate it refers to the error in D-dimensional space. The
previous result indicates that the integrals necessary to ﬁnd the bolstered
error estimate in D-dimensional space can be equivalently carried out in d-
dimensional space. This is akin to resubstitution. where the error count is
the same whether it is done in D- or d-dimensional space. For performance
comparison purposes. we will also estimate the kernel size using only the
low-dimensional data Si . resulting in a bolstered error estimator $301“. which
uses the originally proposed kernel variance (no correction. or k0 = 1). For
feature selection. we will use sequential forward ﬂoating search (SFFS)
(Pudil et al.. 1994).

2.3 Optimization method

To ﬁnd the optimal kernel scaling factor k . we utilize the following
procedure:
Protocol 1

(1) Generate a sample set S? of size n and a total of D features from a
speciﬁed synthetic model.

(2) Select a size-d feature set A using a feature-selection method F on
SE. resulting in a reduced dimension sample set S2 for the feature
setA.

(3) Design a classiﬁer 110, for S3 according to the given classiﬁcation
rule ‘11”.

(4) Compute the true error 8,, using the underlying distribution of
the model.

(5) Compute the 10-fold cross-validation error 23W (keeping in mind that
feature selection must be repeated for each fold).

Ad
(6) Compute the bolstered error abolsl.

(7) Compute the bolstered errors 535:“ for a list of kernel scaling factors
k k

0,1” D,2""‘
(8) Calculate RMS for each error estimator by repeating Steps 1 through
7 a number N of times.

(9) Repeat Steps 1 through 8 for different models M . different levels of
model complexities and different classiﬁcation rules ‘11”.

We consider four data models. each a two-class Gaussian model with
equally likely classes and class-conditional densities having covariance
matrices 21 and 22. One class mean is located at —[l and the other at  with
the location of [l 28* [a 1 a2  a0] depending on the model. The parameter
8 is chosen to achieve prescribed values for the expected classiﬁcation error
E[e,,]; different values of E[8,,] represent different levels of difﬁculty at
sample size n.

Table 1 gives a summary of the simulation experiments. Two limiting
factors should be noted. First. the maximum total number of features. 500.
is smaller than those often considered in microarray studies and. second. the
number of selected features is kept to 5 or 10. There are three reasons for this.
one pragmatic to our set of simulations and the others having to do with the
nature of feature selection. The pragmatic reason is computational: we wish
to do a large simulation study and therefore want to limit the computational
burden. As for feature selection. given the sample sizes. it is prudent to
keep the numbers of total and selected features small to have satisfactory
feature selection (Sima and Dougherty. 2006a) and the number of selected
features small to avoid the peaking phenomena (Hua et al.. 2005. 2009).
Regarding the total number of features. limiting the total number of features
Via prior biological knowledge or requirements on data quality raises the
likelihood of ﬁnding good feature sets Via feature selection (Zhao et al..
2010). Regarding the efﬁcacy of selecting small feature sets. studies have
shown that good classiﬁcation can be achieved with two or three genes when
re-examining data from studies that had originally used much larger feature
sets (Braga-Neto. 2007; Grate. 2005).

We plot the RMS versus kernel scaling factor k0 for 813001“. using all
combinations of simulation parameters displayed in Table 1. Additionally.
we compute the RMS for LDA with D:200. d :3 and n:50 for E[8,,] :
0.20. 0.25. 0.30. 0.35. 0.40 and 0.45. For comparison. RMS values for 8301“.
Em and 531,3 are also plotted. which appear as horizontal lines as they are

not related to k0. Here. we present some typical results. the complete set
of plots appearing on the companion website. Note that due to the intensive
computing in Eabs we only compute it for LDA with D:200. d:3 and
n : 50.

Figure 1 shows the result for LDA. n:50. and selecting d:3 out of
D : 200 features for nine values of E [8,1]. Letting kg‘i“ denote the value of k0
achieving minimum RMS. we see that kg‘i“ increases for increasing expected
error. the increase being slight for small expected errors but becoming
signiﬁcant for large expected errors (for E [8,1] : 0.40 and 0.45. kg‘i“ is to
the right of where we have stopped the plots at k0 :2.0; see extended plots
to k0 :3.0 for these cases on the companion website). We observe that Em
and Eabs typically perform better than 8301“. sometimes by a large margin.
However. for an appropriate kernel scaling factor. 513001“ outperforms 531,3
and often outperforms 50V by a wide margin. This improvement is achieved
by a range of scaling factors and is robust across different models and
complexities. Regarding model robustness. for a ﬁxed value of E [8,1] the
RMS curves are remarkably similar; in particular. the value. kg‘i“. of k0
achieving minimum RMS is consistent. In three cases. kg‘i“ remains ﬁxed
across the models and in the others it changes by not > 0.2. Moreover. in
the latter cases. the RMS at the different values of kg‘i“ is approximately the
same. The overall robustness has important practical implications. because in
real-world problems we do not know the data model or its level of difﬁculty.
but we do know the sample size n. the total and selected numbers of features.
D and d. and the classiﬁcation rule. As we will subsequently see. the fact
that kg‘i“ is robust relative to the data model means that. in practice. we can
derive a value of k0 . albeit not optimal. that can be used in 513001“ for a better
error estimator.

There is also robustness with respect to the classiﬁcation rule and number
of features. Figure 2a and b show robustness curves for 3NN and CART.
respectively. for complexity E [8,1] :010 (more on the companion website)
for n:50. d:3 and D:200. The curves bear a strong resemblance to
the corresponding curves for LDA in Figure l and for all models kg‘i“ :
0.8. as with LDA. We again have LDA in Figure 2c for E[e,,] :010
(more on the companion website). but now with D:500. Again there is
resemblance to the corresponding case in Figure l and again kg‘i“ :08 for
all models.

The preceding observations are mostly constrained to small samples.
When n is large. the beneﬁts of using 8&3? tend to diminish. Figure 3a and b
show RMS curves for LDA for rt: 100 and rt: 150. respectively. E [8,1] :
0.10 (more on the companion website). d:3 and D:200. If the model
is known. an optimal 513001“ is achievable. but robustness diminishes. For
n : 100. there is still some robustness. but for n : 150. even a small deviation
from kg‘i“ can result a worse performance than 56V. Hence. for rt: 150.
choosing an appropriate 833:1? is not feasible in practice; however. since our
interest is using bolstered error estimation for very small samples. this is not
a signiﬁcant drawback.

2.4 Implementation for real data

For practical application. based on the sample size. the total and selected
numbers of features. and the classiﬁcation rule. we will perform a model-
based analysis like the ones we have performed. thereby resulting in a look-up
table of pairs (E [8,1],kg‘i“) as in Figure 1. To illustrate. by averaging across
the four models. we obtain the following table for (E[e,,],k2‘i“): (005,08).
(0.10.0.8). (0.15.0.9). (0.20.1.0). (0.25.1.2). (030,1.3). (0,35,1.6). Upon
designing a classiﬁer from the data. we will obtain the 10-fold cross-
Validation error estimate. 80, and then. in the fashion of the method of
moments. set E[e,,]:80 and choose the corresponding value of kg‘i“ to
serve as the scaling factor for bolstering. Since the look-up table is discrete.
E[e,,]:80 must be solved approximately by interpolation. Corresponding
to the seven values of kg‘i“ in the look-up table for Figure l. we have:
kg“ :03 for 80 <0.125, kg‘i“=0.9 for 0.125 550 <0.175, kg“ = 1.0 for
0.175 5 80 < 0.225. kg” : 1.2 for 0.225 580 <0275. kg‘i“ : 1.3 for 0.275 5
80<0.325 and kg‘i“:l.6 for 0325580. If one so desires. then a ﬁner

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To illustrate application, we have applied the method to two gene
expression datasets:

owing to small sample size. (ii) cross-validation has signiﬁcant variance
for small samples. (iii) the estimated model will differ to some extent from
the models involved in creating the look-up table and (iv) the method of
moments is not optimal. The following protocol is used to obtain the bolstered
resubstitution error estimate:

° Myeloma dataset: data are downloaded from the NIH
Protocol2

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession numbers
GSE5900 and GSE2658, which contain 54613 probe sets
and 559 multiple myeloma (MM) samples, as well as 3
other subtypes [monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
signiﬁcance (MGUS)], 44 samples; smoldering MM (SMM),
12 samples; healthy donors with normal plasma cell (NPC),

(1) Given a sample set S5 with size n and dimension D. select a size-d
feature setA using a feature-selection method F on SE. resulting in a
reduced dimension sample set S2 for the feature setA.

(2) Design a classiﬁer 1!!” for Si according to the given classiﬁcation rule

\Iln. and compute the 10-fold cross-validation error estimate 80.

(3) From the look-up table (E [adj/Sm“) choose the kernel scaling factor

using the selected scaling

22 samples (Zhan et al., 2006). Samples are labeled into two
classes, one for MGUS/SMM/NPC and the other for MM.
Due to the signiﬁcant unbalance of the samples between the
two classes, only 156 samples are randomly selected from
the 559 MM samples. The number 156 has been chosen as

a compromise to take as many samples as possible from
MM without signiﬁcant unbalance between the two classes.
Furthermore, only D=200 features with the largest variances
across samples are selected from the total 54 613 probe sets. It
is advantageous to limit ourselves to the 200 features with the
largest variances, because these are more likely to reveal class
discrimination and feature selection tends to perform poorly
for very large numbers of features when samples are small
(Sima and Dougherty, 2006a). Here we must put in a word
of caution concerning the methodology. We are using feature
variance to produce a set of 200 features to be taken as the
full feature set for our performance analysis and will apply
feature selection, classiﬁer design and error estimation based
on this set, including cross-validation. In practice, this approach
would be unacceptable, because the actual dataset to which we
are applying data-dependent feature selection is the full 54 613
probe sets. For instance, cross-validation would have to use the
variance-based feature reduction from the full 54613 on each
fold, else it would be optimistically biased. But that is not our
goal here. We are a priori assuming that there are only 200
features to which we will apply data analysis. In practice, such
a scenario would occur if the reduction to 200 were based on
prior biological knowledge.

° Breast cancer data set: data are from a microarray-based
classiﬁcation study that analyzes breast tumor samples from
295 patients (van de Vijver et al., 2002). Using a previously
established D=70-gene prognosis proﬁle (van’t Veer et al.,
2002), a prognosis signature based on gene expression is
proposed in van de Vijver et al. (2002) that correlates well
with patient survival data and other clinical measures. Of the
295 microarrays, 115 belong to the ‘good-prognosis’ class and
180 belong to the ‘poor—prognosis’ class. Referring to our
cautionary comment regarding the multiple myeloma data, we
note here that feature selection was used originally to obtain the
70 genes, but, again, from our performance perspective, that is
not important for our analysis.

We consider sample size n=50 and d = 3 features selected from
the D: 200 and D :70 features in the myeloma and breast cancer
datasets, respectively, and LDA for classiﬁcation. We repeatedly
draw (stratiﬁed) n=50-point samples with replacement from the
empirical distribution (full dataset) as training data with the
remaining sample points held out for true error estimation in
computing the RMS (50 is still computed from the training data).
The total number of repetitions is 200. The average true error and
SD for the myeloma dataset are 0.2170 and 0.0309, respectively.
For the breast cancer dataset, the average true error and SD are

0.2340 and 0.0362, respectively. Figure 4 shows the RMS for the

two patient datasets. In both cases, Etna performs signiﬁcantly

better. Owing to robustness of the optimal scaling factor, a coarse
selection of expected errors and interpolation has proven sufﬁcient.

To further demonstrate the effectiveness of Protocol 2, we
have applied it to four models in Figure 1: models M1 and
M2 with expected errors 0.20 and 0.35. The performance graphs
corresponding to Figure 4 are provided in Figure 5. Of particular
interest are the scaling factors produced by the protocol. The average
scaling factors for the four models are given by: M1, E [8"] =0.20
— average scaling factor 1.10; M1, E[8,,] =0.35 — average scaling
factor 1.39; M2 E [8"] = 0.20 — average scaling factor 1.09; and M2,

E[8,,] = 0.35 — average scaling factor 1.43. Referring to Figure 1, we
see that all these averages are centered within the range of scaling
factors where optimal bolstering outperforms éabs.

3.1 Robustness to non-Gaussian data

Although k211i“ is derived with Gaussian models, it is robust enough
for models where this assumption is violated, as with the patient data,
where the underlying distribution is almost certainly not Gaussian.
To further investigate this issue, we take the model M2 in Section
2.3, but perturb the skewness and kurtosis of the class at the origin
to obtain a Pearson system (Elderton and Johnson, 1969). Figure 6
shows the eight different distributions in the Pearson system with
varying skewness and kurtosis. For the resulting model Mp and
each skewness and kurtosis combination, where valid, we do the
following:

(1) Generate a sample set S "D of size n = 50 and a total of D = 200
features from the model Mp .

(2) Feature select a size-d = 3 feature setA, resulting in a reduced
dimension sample set S3.

(3) Design a classiﬁer III" for Sg using LDA.

3.2 Concluding remarks

We have derived an optimal kernel scaling factor that can be used for
bolstered error estimation in high feature dimensions. This bolstered
error estimator achieves a signiﬁcant RMS improvement over cross-
validation when samples are small, with continued, albeit smaller,
performance improvement over the adjusted bootstrap. This superior
performance is robust over a wide range of models. Hence, we
have been able to incorporate optimality criteria from across a
collection of families to arrive at suitable bolstering kernels for
practical situations, thereby facilitating its use in applications like
classiﬁcation of genomic data when samples are small.

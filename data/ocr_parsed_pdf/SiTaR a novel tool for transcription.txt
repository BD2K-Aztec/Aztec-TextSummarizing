ABSTRACT

Motivation: Prediction of transcription factor binding sites (T FBSs)
is crucial for promoter modeling and network inference. Quality of the
predictions is spoiled by numerous false positives, which persist as
the main problem for all presently available TFBS search methods.
Results: We suggest a novel approach, which is alternative to widely
used position weight matrices (PWMs) and Hidden Markov Models.
Each motif of the input set is used as a search template to scan
a query sequence. Found motifs are assigned scores depending
on the non-randomness of the motif’s occurrence, the number of
matching searching motifs and the number of mismatches. The non-
randomness is estimated by comparison of observed numbers of
matching motifs with those predicted to occur by chance. The latter
can be calculated given the base compositions of the motif and the
query sequence. The method does not require preliminary alignment
of the input motifs, hence avoiding uncertainties introduced by the
alignment procedure. In comparison with PWM-based tools, our
method demonstrates higher precision by the same sensitivity and
specificity. It also tends to outperform methods combining pattern
and PWM search. Most important, it allows reducing the number of
false positive predictions significantly.

Availability: The method is implemented in a tool called SiTaR
(Site Tracking and Recognition) and is available at http://sbi.hki-

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite the large number of available methods and tools for
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) prediction, the problem of
the high number of false positive (FP) predictions is not solved so far.
The attempts to predict putative binding sites using the information
about known TFBSs have a long history, with the main stream
of PWM-based methods and deviations to applications of other
sequence-based methods, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
(e.g. Frith et (11., 2002), or less widely known approaches like, for
example, intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) theory (Garcia-Alcalde et al.,
2010). Further reﬁnement of predictions can be done by including

additional information, such as genetic and epigenetic factors
in the query region, e.g. Glade-speciﬁc evolutionary parameters,
presence of nearby coding regions (Fu et al., 2009) or phylogenetic
relationships (e.g. Berezikov et al., 2007; Hestand et al., 2008)
or/and genome-wide expression data (e.g. Siewert and Kechris,
2009). These ways are promising and have their ﬁeld of application,
and they also have a serious drawback: this additional information
must be available, which is far from being always the case.

To ﬁnd an optimal balance between high specialization provided
by pattern-based methods and high sensitivity of the PWMs, several
attempts have been made to combine these two approaches. These
attempts were implemented in such tools as AliBaba2 (Grabe,
2002) and P-Match (Chekmenev et al., 2005). AliBaba2 method
is based on the examination of a TFBS context by application of an
extension of the Berg and von Hippel model (Berg and von Hippel,
1987). It includes a step of aligning of known TFBSs with a query
sequence with subsequent construction of a PWM matching each
found motif. The P-Match algorithm uses individual TFBSs along
with the corresponding PWMs. It searches for DNA subsequences
matching one of the TFBSs from the set and calculates the matching
score using the weight matrix. Both approaches, although they
still include the obligatory step of the PWM construction, are a
signiﬁcant step forward in comparison with ‘pure’ PWM-based
methods. Being methodologically interesting and promising, these
tools are, unfortunately, hardly of use in practice: AliBaba2 is not
maintained since 2002, and both tools are dependent on available
PWM libraries, which are outdated in their public versions.

At the end of the day, PWMs remain the state of the art method.
Consequently, the great majority of available tools are PWM based
(see, for example, Bryne et al., 2008; Cartharius et al., 2005;
Kel et al., 2003) and differ mostly in the ways of calculating
the cut-offs. Introduction of e-values, P-values and background
modeling [e.g. in Matrix-scan of RSAT (Turatsinze et (11., 2008)]
allow to reduce the number of FF to some extent. Other tools
tend to use more mathematically sophisticated methods, such as
variable order Bayesian trees and variable order Markov models
[e.g. VOMBAT tool (Grau et al., 2006)] without breakthrough
results. We think, however, that the problem of motif prediction
should not be approached by generalizations. We decided to develop
a straightforward method based on direct comparison of input
(searching) set motifs with the query sequence (see the Section 2).
We exploit the idea of non-randomness of biologically meaningful
sequence motifs, which can be detected by comparison of observed
motifs’ occurrences with those predicted to happen by Chance.
This simple mathematical approach provides high sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of the method, allowing signiﬁcant reduction of the FP
predictions.

SiTaR

 

We compared our method, implemented in a tool called SiTaR
(Site Tracking and Recognition), with P-Match (http://biobase-
intemational.com/, Chekmenev et (11., 2005) and a state of the
art PWM-based tool Jaspar (http://jaspar.genereg.net/, Bryne et (11.,
2008). SiTaR shows better performance false discovery rate (FDR)
and F -measure, which is the weighted harmonic mean of precision
and recall (see more details in Section 3.2).

In six independent cross-validation experiments for arbitrarily
taken (TFs), we show that our method is not inclined to overﬁtting
and can predict new motifs.

2 METHODS
2.1 SiTaR method

The method is based on the idea that we can calculate the number of motifs
with given base composition and given number of mismatches in a random
sequence (also with the given nucleotide composition). These predicted
numbers can then be compared with the real occurrences of motifs in a
query sequence.

Let the length of the random sequence be L. the length of the motif be
1. the fractions of each nucleotide i in the motif being )3 and in the random
sequence F i. It is easy to show (see Supplementary Material) that the number
of motifs p. with O mismatches can be calculated as:

4
MM): (L—1+1)]_[Ffﬁ. (1)
1:]
With 1 mismatch:
4
1—F»
M11,1=1'M;1,OZ<fiTl)v (2)
i2] ’

and so on. see Supplementary Material for more details.

We can compare these numbers with the real motif occurrences. To count
the real motif occurrences. the query sequence is scanned for motifs with a
sliding window (Fig. 1. Step 1). Each motif of the input TFBS set [searching
motif (SM)] is used as a search template with different number of mismatches
(normally not more than one-third of the motif length; in reality it is up to
four mismatches).

To calculate scores for the found motifs (FM). we ﬁrst assign weights to
all SMs. The weight for a searching motif )1 with the number of mismatches
x we deﬁne as:

M12“: — M552“

pred
V M MJC

where M “32‘” and Mg? are measured and predicted occurrences.
accordingly. The weight is. in fact. the overrepresentation of the counted

WW, = (3)

motifs with the given number of mismatches over the calculated number of
such motifs occurring by chance.

After the weights are assigned to each SM. the score for a found motif A
is calculated as

5(A)=mwaW)>018w (4)
where max(WM,X(M)) is the maximal weight for all searching motifs. 01 is the
11

portion of the SM set that have matched A with positive weight and )3 is the
maximal match (i.e. the maximal portion of A symbols that are identical to
SM symbols).

2.2 Filtering procedure

After the search is run (Fig. 1. Step 1) and the predictions for the putative
motifs and their scores are made (Fig. 1. Steps 275). the list of the predicted
motifs should be ﬁltered to obtain the optimal results.

Fig. 1. Main steps of the SiTaR algorithm. Step 1 (Search): each searching
motif (SM) is used as a search template with different number of mismatches;
Step 2: for each FM. we mark the number of mismatches between it and
each searching motif; Step 3: for each SM. we write down the number of
its counted (in the Step 2) occurrences with given number of mismatches
and the corresponding predicted value of such occurrence by chance. Step
4: the weights for each SM are calculated according to formula (3). Step 5:
calculation of the scores [formula (4)]. The ranked list of the scores is ﬁltered
according to the user’s wishes.

To select the best hits. we provide scores for each found motif. Those
with obviously low scores are ﬁltered out automatically. but in many cases
the decision about what to consider ‘good’ and ‘poor’ results depends on
speciﬁc circumstances of a search. in particular on the reliability of the
input TFBS set. For this occasion. we provide an opportunity to adjust the
ﬁltering threshold according to the desired number of true positive (TP)
hits (estimated by the reidentiﬁcation of true TFBSs inserted in random
sequences. see Section 2.4) and acceptable number of FPS (estimated by
the run on ‘empty’ random sequences). By default. the threshold is set to
100% of the TP with I allowed mismatch per site and the number of FF
corresponding to this threshold is shown in the output. If these numbers
are not satisfactory. the user can adjust them by: (i) selecting other number
of mismatches; and (ii) selecting the optimal score. The search result is
accompanied by a plot showing the dependency of true and FPS on the score
value. The user-friendly design allows to ‘move’ the score threshold in the
plot showing how it inﬂuences the both (TP and FF) parameters and to select
the optimal combination.

2.3 Align or not align?

Principally. SiTaR does not require aligned sequences or even sequences of
the same length. However. sometimes we encounter unreasonably long (up
to 50 bp) TFBSs reported in literature and. consequently. in databases. [The
normal TFBS length is 6712 bp. in rare cases up to 18 bp. IfaTFBS is too long
(3&50bp). it just means that the authors have not well deﬁned the binding
sites and reported approximate regions of the TFBS surroundings] In such
cases. to get searching motifs of reasonable length the reported sequences

Should be aligned with the other TFBSS of the set. If all TFBSS of the set are
too long. we would recommend to reidentify the ‘real’ TFBSS within these
sequences by looking for a common motif of 6712 bp [using programs like
MEME (Bailey and Elkan. 1994) or Gibbs Sampler (Thompson et (11.. 2003)].
If the binding SiteS of the input set are well deﬁned and have comparable
length (allowing the same number of mismatches). they can be submitted to
the program without further treatment.

We want to emphasize that it is not recommendable to look for motifs
<6 bp in any case. because the probability of occurrence of such motifs by
chance is too high. This is true for any kind of application independently of
the searching method: SiTaR. PWMS or another.

2.4 Deﬁning true and FPS

TFBS sets from JaSpar were used as the TP (input) sets in all experiments.
In the teSt run on random sequences (Section 3.2.1). the motifs of the TP
(input) set were hidden in a 10 kb random sequence and then reidentiﬁed.
The results have been cleaned from redundancies (i.e. predictions of motifs
in the same location. Location is considered the same if the predicted motifs
overlap in more than half of the length). The ranked (from the highest to the
lowest score) list of results was cut on the level corresponding to the desired
number of TP (by default. 100%). All the predictions made besides hidden
SiteS were considered as FPS.

SiTaR: the search waS made with O mismatches. the threshold being
adjusted if 100% of the TP (or the genuine TFBS. in the case of the teSt
run on promoters. Section 3.2.2) haS not been reidentiﬁed after the ﬁrSt run.

Jaspar: the search waS made with a low threshold. which waS then adjusted
to get 100% of the TPS.

P-Match: P-Match useS the TRANSFAC matrices. which differ from those
in Jaspar. To run P-Match on the exactly same setS of sequences aS in the
other considered toolS. we created PWMS from the JaSpar TFBSS for each
considered TF uSing Create Matrix option of the Professional version of
MatchTM. The proﬁles in P-Match were applied with the lowest possible
threshold (minFN). and then adjusted to get 100% of the TPS.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Validation of the method

To demonstrate that our models are not overﬁtted and can indeed
predict new motifs, we conducted cross-validation experiments. For
each of the selected TFs, the initial set of TFBSs was arbitrarily
divided into two halves, one serving as a training set, the other
being ‘hidden’ in a random sequence. The whole procedure was
repeated 100 times. The idea was to Check whether the approach
allows to reidentify those genuine motifs, which were not used for
the training.

We repeated the experiment for ﬁve arbitrarily Chosen TFs
from TRANSFAC database (Matys et (11., 2003) and one ‘real-
life’ example taken from a paper reporting binding sites for lel
TF (Jung and Levin, 1999) (Table 1). The average sensitivity and
speciﬁcity by reidentiﬁcation of the ‘new’ motifs are both 99.9%.

3.2 Comparison with other methods

We compared our method with Jaspar database searching tool (Bryne
et (11., 2008) and with P-Match (Chekmenev et (11., 2005). J aspar was
selected as the most prominent PWM-based tool and P-Match is the
representative of ‘mixed’ approaches, utilizing PWM information
along with the alignments of individual TFBSs. The comparison
was run for 22 TFs (Table 2), which were selected according to the
following requirements: (i) the TF should be represented by a PWM
in J aspar; (ii) binding sites should have reasonable length (6—15 bp);

and (iii) the number of sequences in the set should be not too small
(>20). The sites used for the PWM construction were extracted from
Jaspar and considered as the TP set.

3.2.1 Test run on random sequences with hidden true sites All
motifs of the TP set were hidden in a 10kb random sequence;
any hit different from the hidden motif was considered as a PP
prediction, since random sequences are not supposed to contain TPs.
We considered the number of the FP predicted by each tool when
recovering 100% and 90% of the TP (Table 2). For 100% sensitivity,

the results of SiTaR and P-Match are comparable in two-thirds of
cases, in the rest leaving the superiority to SiTaR. In comparison
with Jaspar, SiTaR performs inevitably better for all considered
TFs. For 90% sensitivity, Jaspar shows improved results, but still
the superiority of SiTaR and P-Match is obvious.

To be able to quantitatively compare the methods, we
calculate speciﬁcity [Spc = TN/(FP + TN), where TN stands for true
negatives], false discovery rate [FDR=FP/(FP+TP)] and F05-
measure: Ff; = (1 +132 ) - precision-recall / (f32 -precision+recall );
in this case, 13 is taken equal to 0.5 to give more weight to precision
than to recall. Average Characteristics of each tool by 100% recall
are shown in Figure 2 (see also Supplementary Material for more
details). The speciﬁcity of SiTaR, P-Match and Jaspar are equally
high for all tools and although there is a tendency of SiTaR and
P-Match to outperform Jaspar, the difference is not signiﬁcant. There
is also no difference in the performance of SiTaR and P-Match in
FDR and F -measure. However, these Characteristics signiﬁcantly
differ for SiTaR and Jaspar, SiTaR showing apparently better results
than J aspar.

3.2.2 Test run on promoter sequences To demonstrate the
performance of our tool on real biological sequences, we ran
reprediction of known (experimentally proven) TFBSs in promoters
where they belong. Information about genuine binding sites of
the considered TFs was extracted from TRANSFAC Professional
(version 2001.1). The sites were selected according to the
following requirements: (i) there should be solid evidence of DNA
binding; (ii) coordinates of the TFBS should be provided; and
(iii) the corresponding promoter sequence should be available in
TRANSFAC. In such way, we collected 44 genuine binding sites for
16 TFs in 38 promoters. The promoter sequences were cut to 2000 bp
upstream transcription start sites (according to TRANSFAC).
The search was made with the same input TFBS sets as in the
previous experiment. The searching parameters were adjusted in
such way that we could detect the real TFBSs. All predictions with
the scores lower than the score of the genuine site were ﬁltered out.
The true TFBSs were successﬁilly reidentiﬁed by SiTaR and Jaspar
in all considered promoters (Table 3). P-Match, however, could not
ﬁnd the sites in nine promoters probably due to too high pre-deﬁned
cut-offs, which are not adjustable in the professional version of the
tool (these cases are marked as ‘not found’, NF, in the Table 3).

In approximately 25% of promoters (9 of 38), the performance of
the three tools was similarly successful: the number of predictions

sure in non-functionality of a predicted binding site. This kind of
negative evidence is not published, and actually not investigated. On
the other hand, our observations made for real TFBSs in mammalian
promoters (based on the data from TRANSFAC) suggest that the

number of occurrences of binding sites for the same TF in one
promoter is rarely > 10. Taking this into account, we can assume that
all predictions that are <10 per promoter are equally good and can be
considered not as false, but as potentially ﬁinctional TFBSs. Under
this assumption, we consider additional predictions as potentially
true in 10 of 38 promoters (~25%) (Table 3: R14636, R16113,
R05060, R24474, R04344, R12441, R22697, R25977, R25317,
R20171, R23225, R09707). In seven promoters, SiTaR is superior to
P-Match, but the results of SiTaR and Jaspar do not differ (R05061,
R29890, R08566, R25062, R20786, R19784, R00036). Only in one
case of 38 considered SiTaR was outperformed by P-Match (Elkl in
TNFalpha promoter: one of the three known sites had a low score,
hence the number of additional predictions grew to 26 opposed by
17 in P-Match, the number of Jaspar predictions being 43; we must
admit, however, that the performance of all tools was not optimal
in this promoter). SiTar was not outperformed by Jaspar in any of
the considered promoters. Finally, in nine cases (23%) (R00270,
R05040, R24127, R29073, R08567, R16582, R00142, R29834,
R13028, R13029), SiTaR outperforms the both competitors.

All in all, SiTaR performed equally or better in 37 promoters of
38 considered.

4 DISCUSSION

SiTaR is a method for nucleotide composition-based detection of
non-random matching motifs applied to prediction of TFBSs or other
types of motifs. One of the evident advantages of the method is that
it does not require equal length of the searching motifs, nor their
alignment, nor a construction of a PWM nor any other modeling
prior to the search. Any of those steps (aligning, trimming to equal
length, etc.) leads to the loss of information (as any generalization)
and hence introduces some degree of uncertainty in the ﬁnal result.
Thus, avoiding these steps we preserve as much information as
there was in the initial set of TFBS sequences. It is notable that
the demand for a high quality of the initial (searching) set of
TFBS sequences is equally strong for any approach: ours or PWM
based.

The other, quite important, consequence of the lack of the above-
mentioned steps is saving of time and efforts. To use SiTaR, one
needs to have just a set of known TFBS sequences; this can come
directly from a publication or a database. To use any PWM-based
tool, one needs to have the PWM. It either can be found in a matrix
database, such as TRANSFAC or J aspar, or has to be made de novo
(from that set of known sequences, which we directly use in SiTaR).
To do that, one has to (i) align the sequences; (ii) ﬁnd a tool for PWM
construction; and (iii) apply it. Of note, Jaspar and other prominent
PWM-based tools like Matrix-scan or the public version of P-Match
do not allow to construct own matrices.

This means that even when SiTaR demonstrates equal
performance with a PWM-based tool, this result is achieved by lower
expenses.

The experiment with reidentiﬁcation of the TP set with three
different methods showed general superiority of the tools that use
aligning of individual motifs (SiTaR and P-Match). This conforms to
the thesis that PWMs are too generalized. P-Match tries to overcome
the PWM generalization by including the step of aligning of
individual motifs of a PWM with subsets of the query sequence and
applying the PWM Characteristics when calculating the scores. This

attempt signiﬁcantly improves the prediction in terms of the number
of FPs. However, P-Match remains dependent on PWMs, with all
consequences discussed in the previous paragraphs. In SiTaR, we
omit the generalization step completely.

The positive feature of PWMS is that they reﬂect conservation of
particular nucleotides within the motif. This kind of information is
not directly considered by our method, since we allow mismatches
in any position of the motif. However, the theoretically allowed
mismatches in the conserved positions are in practice corrected
by matching of the ‘Correct’ (true) motifs and accumulation of
the correct matches. So the conservation of a certain base is in
fact taken into account in an indirect way. To reinforce this effect,
we put special emphasis on the multiple matching of the motifs
when calculating the score. On the other hand, one should not
underestimate the fact that TFBS sets can be very divergent, and
some single true sites may strongly differ from the rest of the set (in
fact, they can be completely unalignable). In a PWM (and, hence,
in P-Match), such sites are in a way suppressed, so that their
content is not reﬂected neither by the consensus sequence nor by
the weights assigned to each position. On the opposite, our approach
allows each motif to play its role independently of the rest of the
set. So ﬁnally SiTaR is balancing between multiple and individual
matching, allowing each of them to be equally successful if the found
motif is recognized as non-random.

In terms of accuracy of predictions, by 100% of sensitivity SiTaR
is superior to J aspar when reidentifying TFBSs in random sequences
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S1). The results of P-Match and
SiTaR do not signiﬁcantly differ, although also here there is a slight
tendency of SiTaR to have lower FDR and higher F0.5-measure
(Supplementary Table S1).

Ideally, all sites presented in databases like TRANSFAC should
be genuine, but we cannot exclude the possibility that one or two of
them are actually false, simply because of the FP rate of the wet-lab
experiments. For this reason, it not always makes sense to insist on
the recovering of the whole TP set; in fact, in some TFBS sets we can
observe just one sequence obviously not belonging to the rest of the
set, ‘spoiling’ the whole picture. Taking into account such Chances,
we also considered reidentiﬁcation of 90% of the TP. For this level
of sensitivity, the difference in the performance of all considered
tools is not anymore signiﬁcant; however, the tendency of SiTaR to
outperform Jaspar and P-Match remains the same (Supplementary
Table S1).

In promoter sequences, the performance of SiTaR is comparable
with that of Jaspar in 27 of 38 promoters (~70%); in the rest 30%,
however, SiTaR predicts less additional (potentially FP) sites. Since
we do not know the real number of TP TFBSs in genuine promoters,
we cannot estimate such Characteristics as FDR, but we can judge
about the sensitivity of the methods. In the considered examples,
we can see that the sensitivity of Jaspar and SiTaR is equally high
(100% of the real TFBSs are redetected), whereas the sensitivity of
P-Match remains quastionable (we will return to this point in a few
lines).

Our demands to the interpretation of the predictions in promoters
can be formulated as following: (i) the true TFBS has to be
recovered; (ii) there should not be too many TP sites (we allowed
up to 10 additional TFBSs considering them as potentially TP; an
excess over 10 was considered as potential FPS). Both criteria are
met by SiTaR with success. It reidentiﬁes all true TFBSs (of note,
for this analysis we tried to select those true TFBSs that have not

SiTaR

 

been used in the SM set); the number of potential FP predictions
made by SiTaR is in average lower than that predicted by P-Match
and Jaspar.

The other advantage of our tool is the possibility to interactively
adjust the ﬁltering threshold. The importance of this procedure is
illustrated by the problems encountered by P-Match by redetection
of TFBSs in real promoters. In SiTaR and Jaspar, the cut-offs are
adjustable and this allows to reidentify all true TFBSs. In P-Match,
on the opposite, there are only three ﬁxed cut-offs and the lowest
of them (MinFN, minimal false negatives) appeared to be still too
high for the reidentiﬁcation of the genuine TFBSs. As a result, the
tool fails because of the problem that has nothing to do with the
algorithm.

Normally, to change the cut-offs one has to return on the input
page and change some input parameters. In some tools (like P-Match
and MatchTM in TRANSFAC), a special procedure of creating a
matrix proﬁle is needed. In the others, like Jaspar, it is not clear
what the score means, so the procedure of the threshold selection
is ‘blind’. Having had a severe experience with other tools, we
endeavored to make the procedure of the threshold adjustment clear
and simple. The user can watch simultaneously: the selected number
of mismatches; the current score; the corresponding numbers of FF
and TP. The interactive plot allows to see what will be the values of
TP and FF if the score changes.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing greatly increases the
capacity to detect rare-variant complex-trait associations. However,
it is still expensive to sequence a large number of samples and
therefore often small datasets are used. Given cost constraints, a
potentially more powerful two-step strategy is to sequence a subset
of the sample to discover variants, and genotype the identified
variants in the remaining sample. If only cases are sequenced,
directly combining sequence and genotype data will lead to inflated
type-l errors in rare-variant association analysis. Although several
methods have been developed to correct for the bias, they are either
underpowered or theoretically invalid. We proposed a new method
SEQCHIP to integrate genotype and sequence data, which can be
used with most existing rare-variant tests.

Results: It is demonstrated using both simulated and real datasets
that the SEQCHIP method has controlled type-l errors, and
is substantially more powerful than all other currently available
methods.

Availability: SEQCHIP is implemented in an R-Package and

1 INTRODUCTION

There is solid evidence that rare variants play an important role in
the etiology of complex traits (Bodmer and Bonilla, 2008; Cohen
et (11., 2004; Cohen et (11., 2006; Fearnhead et (11., 2004; Ji et (11.,
2008; Kryukov et (11., 2007; Romeo et (11., 2007; Romeo et (11.,
2009). The development and implementation of next-generation
sequencing in genetic studies of complex traits have made possible
the detection of rare variant associations. However, it is still very
expensive to sequence a large number of samples at high coverage
depth, which is necessary to accurately detect rare variants for
association studies. Instead of sequencing all samples, a two-stage
strategy can be applied, where a subset of the sample is sequenced
to discover variants, and the identiﬁed variants are then genotyped
in the remaining sample. Genotyping currently is considerably less

expensive than sequencing, therefore given a ﬁxed budget, a two-
stage design can be much more powerful than a one-stage design,
where only sequencing is used. This is because for the same ﬁnancial
expenditure, genetic information from a much larger number of
samples can be extracted and analyzed in a two-stage study. In
fact, the two-stage study design has been widely applied. Many
rare variant associations were identiﬁed for a number of clinically
important traits, including colorectal adenomas (Fearnhead et (11.,
2004), age-related macular degeneration (Raychaudhuri et (11.,
2011), lipids level (Sanna et (11., 2011) and inﬂammatory bowel
disease (Rivas et (11., 2011).

In a two-stage study, candidate genes that were previously
implicated in the etiology of complex trait through genome-wide
association studies or functional studies may be sequenced to
identify rare variants. It was demonstrated that sequencing >500
cases can uncover variants that can explain over 80% of the
locus population attributable risk (Liu and Leal, 2010b). When
more sophisticated methods are used for selecting samples, e.g.
calculating expected number of causal variants for each individual
and sequencing the individuals with the maximal counts (Edwards
et (11., 2010), it is potentially possible to enrich for causal variants
using a smaller sample size than if samples are randomly selected.
To make the two-stage-design cost effective for large scale studies,
the commercially available exome chip can also be customized and
up to 30 000 variants can be added. Alternatively, custom genotyping
arrays can also be developed.

For the two-stage study design integrating sequencing and
genotyping, it was shown that for a ﬁxed number samples sequenced,
sequencing only cases can be more powerful than sequencing a
balanced number of cases and controls, for detecting associations
with causal variants that are enriched in cases (Longmate et (11.,
2010). This is because a larger portion of low frequency causal
variants can be identiﬁed by sequencing only cases. However, it
has also been shown (Li and Leal, 2009) that type-I errors will be
inﬂated for two-stage studies where only cases are sequenced to
discover variants and naive analysis is implemented, which directly
integrates sequence and genotype data and compares aggregated
variant frequencies between cases and controls. A straightforward
correction is to exclude the sequence data used for variant discovery
and use only the genotyped samples in the downstream association
analysis (GSO — genotype samples only). However, this approach
does not make ﬁill use of the available data and is underpowered,
especially when a large portion (e.g. >50%) of affected individuals
are sequenced for variant discovery. In Longmate et (11. (2010),
the authors suggested removing gne variant carrier from the

sequenced sample per variant nucleotide site (ROPS). When data
are integrated using—the ROPS method, rare variant association tests
have controlled type-I error. However, this method is not without
problems: (i) when there are many variant sites within the analyzed
region, the ROPS method may result in removing a large number
of variant carriers from the analysis, which is highly inefﬁcient; and
(ii) When covariates are included in the analysis, variant carriers
may not be interchangeable under the null hypothesis, which makes
it statistically invalid to apply the ROPS method.

Given the limitations of existing methods, it is desirable to have
a statistical method that can correct for the bias induced by the
two-stage study design and can be integrated with existing rare
variant association methods (Bhatia et (11., 2010; Han and Pan,
2010; Ionita-Laza et (11., 2011; Liu and Leal, 2010a; Madsen and
Browning, 2009; Neale et (11., 2011; Price et (11., 2010; Wu et (11.,
2011). In this article, SEQCHIP, a likelihood-based method for
integrating sequence and genotype data was developed to correct
for the bias created by two-stage study design. The method corrects
for the variant genotypes obtained from sequencing, such that the
corrected genotypes approximately follow the same distribution as
that of the genotyped samples. The method can be used with any
existing rare variant association tests that can analyze uncertain
genotypes, e.g. imputed genotypes. In particular, the weighted
sum statistics (WSS) have been extended to incorporate imputed
genotypes ()(Zawistowski et (11., 2010). The extensions of the test of
the aggregated number of rare variants (ANRV; Morris and Zeggini,
2010) is straightforward where the genotype coding at each variant
site can be replaced by ‘dosage’ (Guan and Stephens, 2008; Li et (11.,
2010; Zheng et (11., 2011). The variable threshold (VT) test (Price
et (11., 2010) computes the ANRV test statistics for each frequency
threshold and then uses their maximum as the test statistic. To control
for multiple testing, p-values of VT are obtained empirically. The
three tests are used to evaluate the performance of different data
integration methods, i.e. ROPS, SEQCHIP and GSO.

We evaluated the performance of SEQCHIP through extensive
simulations. Genetic data were generated using a realistic population
genetic model (Kryukov et (11., 2009). Disease phenotypes were
simulated based upon parameters estimated from complex trait
studies. We showed that when data are integrated using SEQCHIP,
type-I errors for rare variant association tests are well controlled
and the power is consistently higher than integrating data through
ROPS (Longmate et (11., 2010) or analyzing genotyped samples gnly
(GSO) in all the scenarios that were examined.

As an application of the SEQCHIP method, we re-analyzed
samples from a case control study of colorectal adenomas
(Fearnhead et (11., 2004). Sequence data were generated on ﬁve
genes, which were previously implicated in the etiology of colorectal
adenomas (Frayling et (11., 1998; Kim et (11., 2000; Lamlum et (11.,
2000; Lipton et (11., 2003). In the study, 124 cases were sequenced
to discover variants, and the identiﬁed variants were followed up
and genotyped in 483 controls. Association analysis was carried-out
by directly comparing total variant frequencies between sequenced
cases and genotyped controls, and therefore the estimated p-values
could be inﬂated. We re-analyzed this dataset, where sequence
and genotype data were integrated using SEQCHIP and ROPS
methods. The ANRV, WSS and VT tests were implemented to
detect associations with rare variants. The association signal was
statistically signiﬁcant when the correction for the two-stage design
was made using SEQCHIP, but not when ROPS was used. It should

be noted that the GSO method could not be applied because all
cases were sequenced and only controls were genotyped. The
results veriﬁed the association with colorectal adenomas using valid
methods and established that the SEQCHIP method is essential for
integrating sequence and genotype data in cost-effective two-stage
association studies.

2 METHODS
2.1 SEQCHIP method

We assume that there are N A affected individuals and NU unaffected
individuals in the sample. Among the affected individuals. N S (i.e.
individuals 1.2.  N S) are sequenced to discover variants. An additional
NG =NA —NS cases (i.e. individuals NS +1.  NA) and NU controls are
genotyped at the variant nucleotide sites that were uncovered in the sequence
sample. The multi-site genotype for an individual i at the candidate gene locus
is denoted by a vector. i.e.

XL] x2,l XKJ
X»: i . i  i .
’ xiii x122 XIKJ

where each entry k represents a site with di-allelic single-nucleotide
variations. and xf’j is an indicator of whether the jth variant at site k is
the minor allele. The total number of minor alleles observed at site k in the
sequenced sample follows a truncated binomial distribution. i.e.

NS NS
Pr xf’l +xf’22m fo’l+xf’2>0
1:1

i:l

<2Ns ) (pk)m(1_pk)2NS—m

— (1—(1—171)2NS) i

where pk is the minor allele frequency (MAF) at site k.
It is clear from the above equation that the expected number of minor
alleles at site k in the sequenced cases satisﬁes

E Ex, +x, Ex, +x, >0 =— (2)

Therefore. a naive estimate of allele frequencies (i.e. the mean number of
minor alleles per chromosome) will be inﬂated by a factor of 1 /ck. where

The idea behind the SEQCHIP method is to correct for the genotypes
of the samples that are sequenced. such that corrected sequence genotypes
approximately follow the same distribution as that of the genotyped
samples. Speciﬁcally. auxiliary variables are deﬁned for the samples that
are sequenced. i.e.

generally unknown. In practice. they can be estimated from the data. Details

for the MAP estimators are displayed in Supplementary Appendix SB.

it is also possible to use a mixture likelihood which integrates uncertainties in
the modiﬁed genotype. However. when multiple rare variants are analyzed.
calculating the mixture likelihood can be computationally intensive and
numerically unstable. Therefore. the mixture likelihood approach is not
pursued.

In principle. all rare variant association tests that can analyze uncertain
genotypes (e.g. imputed genotypes) can be directly applied to analyze the
SEQCHIP corrected genotypes. Score tests can be implemented. and standard
permutation procedure can be used to obtain empirical p-Values.

2.2 ROPS and GSO method

We compared the SEQCHIP method with the ROPS (Longmate et (11.. 2010)
and GSO methods. Speciﬁcally. the ROPS method removes one randomly
chosen variant carrier for each uncovered variant site. Therefore. if there
are K variant sites uncovered in the sample. a total of K samples will be
removed and N A+N U—K samples will be analyzed following the ROPS
approach (Longmate et (11.. 2010). For the GSO method. all individuals that
are sequenced are removed from subsequent association analyses.

2.3 Generation of genetic and phenotypic data

We simulated genetic data using a four-parameter population genetic
model (Adams and Hudson. 2004; Kryukov et (11.. 2009). The model was
estimated using sequence data from the Ottawa Obesity Study (Ahituv
at (11.. 2007). and incorporates both demographic change (i.e. bottleneck and
exponential expansion) and purifying selection. which are believed to affect
rare variant site frequency spectrums. Details for the population genetics
model parameters can be found in (Kryukov et (11.. 2009). Hardy7Weinberg
equilibrium was assumed for the general population. Phenotype data were
generated according to the following logistic regression model. i.e.

=ﬁ0+z1eczjzr2ﬁkXi

1 — Pr< 11,112,)

Under the alternative hypothesis. two types of phenotypic models were
considered. In the ﬁrst model. a certain proportion of rare variants sites
C are randomly selected to be causal. and affect disease status. The power
was investigated when 10. 70 and 90% of the variant sites are causal. In
the second model. the causality of variants is determined by the selection
coefﬁcient. Power was evaluated. where variants with selection coefﬁcients
>10‘4. 10—3 and 10—2 are causal and affect the disease risk.

Under both models. it is assumed that each causal variant has an odds
ratio of 3 and non-causal variants have an odds ratio of 1. i.e.

log

_ log(3) kEC

m 0 k¢C.,

as suggested by Bodmer and Bonilla (2008). Under the null hypothesis. all
ﬁgs are set to be 0.

2.4 Evaluation of type-I errors and power

Type-I errors of rare variant association tests were evaluated under four
different data integration strategies. i.e. (i) naive method. which directly
combines data without corrections.;ii) SEQCHIP. (iii) ROPS and (iv)
GSO. Scenarios were considered where 500 cases/500 controls and 1500

cases/1500 controls were analyzed. For each case control dataset. we
considered study designs where 10. 50 and 90% of the cases were sequenced
to discover variants. and the identiﬁed rare variants (with MAF < 1%) were
followed-up and genotyped in the remaining samples. For the data integration
strategies under which the rare variant association tests have controlled type-I
errors. (i.e. SEQCHIP. ROPS and GSO). the power was also compared. One
sided tests were performed. i.e. the alternative hypothesis that there is an
increased number of rare causal alleles in cases is tested. For the ANRV
method. statistical signiﬁcance was obtained analytically. whereas the p-
values for WSS and VT were obtained empirically using 2000 permutations.
The power and type-1 errors for different tests were evaluated using 10 000
replicates.

2.5 Evaluation of study designs

We also evaluated different two-stage study designs that sequence a portion
of the sample to discover variants and genotype identiﬁed variants in the
remaining samples. Speciﬁcally. by applying the SEQCHIP method and
performing rare variant association testing using ANRV. WSS and VT.
we compared the study design of sequencing only cases with that of
sequencing an equal number of cases and controls. and combining sequence
and genotype data Via meta-analysis methods. p-Values for ANRV were
evaluated analytically. whereas that for WSS and VT were calculated using
2000 permutations. For meta-analysis. p-Values were transformed to Z-score
statistics. which were then weighted by the square root of the sample size
and combined (Munafo and Flint. 2004). Power at each sequence sample size
was obtained based upon 10 000 replicates. A signiﬁcance level of 01 = 0.05
is used.

2.6 The analysis of sequence dataset of colorectal
adenomas

In the colorectal adenoma dataset. ﬁve genes were ﬁrst sequenced in cases for

variant discovery and the identiﬁed variants were then genotyped in controls.

In this article. we re-analyze the dataset using two valid data integration

methods. i.e. ROPS and SEQCHIP. ANRV. WSS and VT tests were applied

to detect associations with rare variants.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluation of type-I errors

Type-I errors of the ANRV test were displayed in (Table 1) and
that of the WSS and VT tests are shown in (Supplementary Table
S1), for different strategies of integrating sequence and genotype
data. In the naive analyses where no corrections were made for the
sequence data, type-I errors for all tests were highly inﬂated. In some
scenarios, the type-I error can be >30% under a signiﬁcance level
of a = 0.05. For example, when 90% of the cases were sequenced in
a sample of 1500 cases and 1500 controls, the type-I errors for the
ANRV, WSS and VT tests are, respectively, 30.3, 29.9 and 60.4%.

When sequence and genotype data were combined using
SEQCHIP and ROPS, the type-I errors for rare variant association
tests were controlled. However, the correction by ROPS can be
overly conservative. For example, the type-I error for ANRV, WSS
and VT are, respectively, 0.022 (with 95% CI [0.019, 0.025]), 0.015
(with 95% CI [0.013, 0.017]) and 0.017 (with 95% CI [0.014, 0020])
when 50% cases were sequenced in a sample of 500 cases and 500
controls. For the same scenario, if the SEQCHIP method is used, the
type-I error for the three tests are also conservative, but to a lesser
extent (i.e. ANRV: 0.035 with 95% CI [0.031, 0.039], WSS: 0.036
with 95% CI [0.032, 0.040] and VT: 0.043 with 95% CI [0.039,
0.047]).

3.2 Power comparisons

We compared the performance of different data integration methods,
for which rare variant association tests have controlled type-I errors,
i.e. SEQCHIP, ROPS and GSO. SEQCHIP method outperforms
other methods in most scenarios. In some scenarios the power
improvement can be as high as 30%. For example, when variant
causality is determined by ﬁtness, (i.e. variants with selection
coefﬁcients >10_4 are causal with effects 13k =log (3), keC), if
90% of the cases were sequenced in a sample of 1500 cases and
1500 controls, the power for VT test is 76.5% (Fig. 1f). In the same
scenario, if data are integrated by ROPS and GSO methods, the
power for VT is only 55.6 and 34.1%, respectively.

ROPS methods can be conservative for correcting the genotypes
of low frequencies variants. This is reﬂected by two observations:
(i) when a small number of cases are sequenced and the data are
integrated using ROPS, the power may be lower than when only
genotype samples are analyzed (i.e. GSO method); (ii) when a larger
portion cases are sequenced, the power for rare variant association

tests may decrease. For example, when causality is assumed to be
independent of ﬁtness, (i.e.70% of the variants are causal with effect
13k =log(3), k e C), if 90% of the cases are sequenced for a cohort
of 1500 cases and 1500 controls and ROPS is used to integrate the
data, the power for WSS is 61.6%, which is lower than the power
(67.4%) when 50% of the cases are sequenced (Fig. 2e). This is
because for the ROPS method, by taking out one variant carrier
from the sequenced cases, a greater proportion of the carriers are
removed from the sequenced cases than from the entire sample, and
the variant frequencies may be slightly underestimated. Speciﬁcally,
when N S cases are sequenced to discover variants and NG cases
and NU controls are genotyped, the variant frequencies in cases are

estimated by ﬁAROPS=<MS+MG—l)/<2NS+2NG—1), where

M S and M G are the number of minor alleles observed in sequenced
and genotyped cases for a given site. On the other hand, the variant
frequencies in genotyped cases are estimated by 131330 =M /NG.
It is easy to verify numerically that when varlant frequenCIes are
low, ﬁﬁops can be smaller in value than [31330. For example,
when only one variant is observed in the sequenced cases for a

given site, ﬁAROPS =M G/ <2NS +2NG — 1), which is smaller than

ﬁéSO=MG/2NG. We also proved rigorously using probability
theory (Supplementary Appendix SA), that when SEQCHIP or
ROPS are used to integrate data, the variant frequencies can
be slightly underestimated, i.e. E<13§OP31MS > 0) <E<ﬁéso).
Therefore, although more causal variants may be uncovered by
sequencing additional samples and sample size can be increased
by integrating sequence samples, the accumulated downward biases
may mitigate the variant frequencies between cases and controls,
and reduce the power for rare variant association tests.

The GSO method only analyzes genotyped samples, and therefore
can be vastly underpowered when a large portion of the cases are
sequenced. For example, under the model assuming that variant
causality is determined by ﬁtness (i.e. variants with selection
coefﬁcients >10_4 are causal with effects 13k =log (3), k e C), for a

sample of 1500 cases and 1500 controls, if 90% of the cases are
sequenced for variant discoveries, the power of WSS is 38.2%.
However, when sequence and genotype data are combined using
SEQCHIP or ROPS, the power for WSS is, respectively, 73.5 and
58.2% (Fig. 1f). Due to the conservativeness in the estimation of
allele frequencies, when a smaller proportion of cases are sequenced,
e.g. 10 or 50%, the GSO method can have greater power than the
ROPS method. For example, in a sample of 1500 cases and 1500
controls, when 50% of the cases are sequenced, the power for WSS is
61.7% if data are integrated using ROPS, and 66.2% if GSO method
is used and only genotype data are analyzed (Fig. 1e).

The results of the power analyses for alternative selection
coefﬁcient cutoffs (i.e. 10‘2 and 10‘3) can be found in
Supplementary Figures S2 and S3. Additionally Supplementary
Figures S4 and S5 display the results of the power analysis when
10 and 90% of the variants are randomly chosen to be causal. For
these additional power comparisons, the relative performances of
different data integration methods remain unchanged. Among the
three rare variant association methods that were examined, there
is not a single method that is consistently the most powerﬁil.
The advantage of different methods over each other is small.
This is concordant with other existing reviews on rare variant
association analyses methods (Basu and Pan, 2011; Ladouceur et (11.,
2012).

3.3 Comparison of study designs

Figure 3 displays the power of the two study designs which sequence
a portion of the samples to discover variants and genotype the
identiﬁed variants in the remaining sample. It is demonstrated that
when only a small number of samples are sequenced, sequencing
only cases is more powerful than sequencing a balanced number of
cases and controls. However, as the number of sequenced samples
increases, the advantage of sequencing only cases diminishes
because the data integration methods may be conservative for
estimating rare variant frequencies. It is more powerful to sequence

Fig. 3. Power comparison of two-stage study designs. Results are shown
when only cases are sequenced for variant discovery (solid lines with circles)
and when a balanced number of cases and controls (dashed lines with
triangles) are sequenced. (3) displays results when 70% of the variants
are randomly chosen to be causal. and (b) displays results where variants
with selection coefﬁcients >10‘4 are causal. Scenarios are examined when
different numbers of samples are sequenced from 1500 cases and 1500
controls. When only cases are sequenced. SEQCHIP is used to correct
for the bias. When an equal number of cases and controls are sequenced.
sequence and genotype data are analyzed separately and meta-analysis is
used to combine the results. For all scenarios VT is used to detect rare
variant associations

a balanced number of cases and controls to discover variants and
then combine the sequence and genotype data by meta-analysis
methods. The power comparisons remain similar when the ANRV
(Supplementary Fig. S6) and WSS (Supplementary Fig. 7) tests are
implemented.

As a comparison, we also calculated the power when all samples
are sequenced for the study (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The
results can be viewed as the ‘maximal’ achievable power if there are
no budgetary constraints and the entire sample can be sequenced.

3.4 Analysis of colorectal adenoma dataset

We jointly analyzed variants in ﬁve genes i.e. APC, AXINI ,
CTNNBI, hMLHI and hMSHZ. A total of 12 missense mutations
were identiﬁed through sequencing 124 cases with colorectal cancer,
and the identiﬁed variants were then genotyped in 483 controls.
Three analyses were performed for the dataset.

First we combined sequence and genotype data with SEQCHIP
method, and analyzed the resulting dataset with the ANRV, WSS and
VT. One-sided tests were performed, which tests for the enrichment
of rare variant alleles in colorectal adenomas patients. The p-values

are, respectively, given by p:%%$HIP = 0.034, 113133514111) = 0.023
and pngCHIP = 0.106 (Table 2). The p-values for ANRV and WSS

are signiﬁcant. Second, we combined sequence and genotype dataset
by the ROPS method. No signiﬁcant results were observed (i.e.
pﬁggsv =0.080, pVRglgs = 0.088 and [1591’s =0.144).

Finally, for comparison purposes, the dataset was also analyzed
under the naive strategy, where sequence and genotype data are
directly combined without corrections. The p-values are clearly
biased, for all tests (i.e. pﬁé‘gv = 0.004, pgsisvse = 0.005 and pQﬁEV6 =
0.005). This is concordant with our theoretical expectations and
observations from simulated dataset. We also analyzed each gene
individually. However, each gene alone contains too few rare
variants and the analyses were not signiﬁcant (data not shown).

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we developed a data integration method for two-
stage case control studies where a portion of cases are sequenced
to discover variants, and the identiﬁed variants are genotyped in
the remaining sample. The SEQCHIP method performs a correction
on the variant genotypes observed in sequenced cases, such that
the corrected sequence genotypes follow approximately the same
distribution as that of the genotyped samples. The integrated dataset
can be analyzed by all existing rare variant association tests that
can handle genotypes with uncertainties (e.g. imputed genotypes).
SEQCHIP can also be used with regression-based methods for
detecting primary or secondary traits associations (Lin and Zeng,

2009; Liu and Leal, 2011), where confounders such as population
substructures can be controlled. Through extensive simulations, we
demonstrate that when SEQCHIP is used to integrate sequence and
genotype data, all rare variant association tests have controlled type-
I errors. The power can be substantially improved compared with
using other data integration strategies, i.e. ROPS and GSO.

The method is mainly developed for combining sequence
and genotype data when only cases were sequenced for variant
discoveries. A popular alternative two-stage study design is to
sequence a combination of selected cases and controls for variant
discovery, and genotype the identiﬁed variants in the rest of the
samples. Under this study design, sequenced and genotyped samples
can be separately analyzed and combined using standard meta-
analyses methods, which will have controlled type-I error rates.
When both cases and controls are sequenced, protective variants
for the disease phenotype may be uncovered with higher probability
(Rivas et (11., 2011). For a two-stage study that combines sequence
and genotype data, given a small ﬁxed number of samples that
are sequenced, sequencing only cases can be more powerﬁil for
detecting causal variant associations than sequencing a balanced
number of cases and controls.

In practice, it is of interest to know the optimal fraction of cases to
sequence to maximize power. Although sequencing a larger number
of samples allows discovering a higher number of variant sites, it
does not necessarily lead to improved power. This is because the
frequencies of very rare variants identiﬁed in sequenced cases can
be slightly underestimated by ROPS and SEQCHIP methods, which
reduces power. The optimal number depends on the underlying
disease model, the size of the cohort, and the proportion of the cases
that are sequenced, which will need to be examined on a case by
case basis.

Although the cost of sequencing is quickly dropping, genotyping
still has a clear cost advantage. The two-stage study design of
sequencing cases and genotyping the remaining sample allows
extracting genetic information from a much larger number of
samples, which can be more powerﬁil than one stage study design
given a ﬁxed cost constraint. SEQCHIP is a very useﬁil method
for integrating data in a two-stage study design and will greatly
accelerate the process of identifying variants involved in complex
trait etiologies.

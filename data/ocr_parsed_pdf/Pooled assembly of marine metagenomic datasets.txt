ABSTRACT

Motivation: Despite advances in high-throughput sequencing, marine
metagenomic samples remain largely opaque. A typical sample con-
tains billions of microbial organisms from thousands of genomes and
quadrillions of DNA base pairs. Its derived metagenomic dataset
underrepresents this complexity by orders of magnitude because of
the sparseness and shortness of sequencing reads. Read shortness
and sequencing errors pose a major challenge to accurate species
and functional annotation. This includes distinguishing known from
novel species. Often the majority of reads cannot be annotated and
thus cannot help our interpretation of the sample.

Results: Here, we demonstrate quantitatively how careful assembly of
marine metagenomic reads within, but also across, datasets can alle-
viate this problem. For 10 simulated datasets, each with species com-
plexity modeled on a real counterpart, chimerism remained within the
same species for most contigs (97%). For 42 real pyrosequencing
(‘454’) datasets, assembly increased the proportion of annotated
reads, and even more so when datasets were pooled, by on average
1.6% (max 6.6%) for species, 9.0% (max 28.7%) for Pfam protein
domains and 9.4% (max 22.9%) for PANTHER gene families. Our re-
sults outline exciting prospects for data sharing in the metagenomics
community. While chimeric sequences should be avoided in other
areas of metagenomics (e.g. biodiversity analyses), conservative
pooled assembly is advantageous for annotation specificity and sen-
sitivity. Intriguingly, our experiment also found potential prospects for
(low-cost) discovery of new species in ‘old’ data.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput DNA sequencing of microbial communities
(metagenomics) has greatly expanded our knowledge (reviewed
broadly in Schloss and Handelsman, 2005). For example, new
marine biology, a better understanding of biogeochemical cycles
and more are keenly anticipated from this (currently still main)
option for characterizing unculturable species at the molecular
level (Béja et al., 2000; Biller et al., 2014; Dinsdale et al., 2008;
Iverson et al., 2012; Rusch et al., 2007; Venter et al., 2004).
In marine metagenomics (and for samples derived from other

habitats), full realization of the potential of next-generation
sequencing (NGS) relies on high-quality species and functional
annotation of the now hundreds of datasets available to the sci-
entiﬁc community (Gilbert and Dupont, 2011). However, meta-
genome annotation is confounded by (i) the shortness of NGS
reads (W ommack et al., 2008; Temperton and Giovannoni, 2012
review this challenge and others), which merely characterize
small fragments of genes, and (ii) by the small fraction of
known microbes represented in sequence databases, often
described as ‘the culturable 1%’ (Amann et al., 1990; Wooley
et a]. 2010). In traditional genomics, assembling reads into con-
tigs is common practice. By contrast, metagenomes are primarily
released to the community as reads, predominantly from Sanger
or pyrosequencing (‘454’) to date, and even some ‘gold standard’
annotation pipelines are optimized for unassembled data.
Concern over chimeric contigs may explain the reluctance to
assemble. For example, only 3 of the 42 datasets in this work
were assembled according to the publications in which they first
appeared. This may seem justiﬁed to an extent by pyrosequen-
cing read lengths, which typically range from around 1007600 nt
in publically available sets, depending on how recently the data
were obtained. While some annotation can be derived from in-
dividual reads in this range (Thomas et al., 2012; Wommack
et al., 2008), it is plausible that assembly should add value to
the data by improving annotation. However, the potential bene-
ﬁts for annotation have not been quantiﬁed rigorously.

Previous smaller-scale work with simulated assemblies already
suggests that chimeric contigs may not be as common as feared.
For example, Mavromatis et a]. (2007) reported that 8&95% 0f
contigs from assemblies of the most species rich set of their
simulated Sanger-sequencing data did not mix genomes.
Neither did the majority of contigs assembled from simulated
pyrosequencing reads in other work by the Moya group [94%
in Pignatelli et a]. (2011); 68797% in Vazquez-Castellanos et a].
(2014)]. Below, we give this question a deeper look, but we also
take a step further to ask: Is it advisable for deriving species and
function annotation, to cautiously consider not only data from
one sample, but also from others? By allowing limited chimerism
within and across samples we may strike a balance between in-
formation gain and precision (with respect to an individual cell’s
genome) that is beneﬁcial if used strictly for annotation. For
example, a contig identiﬁed as Trichodesmium erythraeum is in-
formative even if the contig mixes strains of this bacterium,
whereas refusal to call the species because a contig fails to
match precisely a known strain tells us nothing.

Fig. 1. Species composition of simulated datasets. The 56 species shown contributed ~99.9% of the total reads across all 10 simulated datasets. Sixty-
three species (51 of them shown above) contributed ~99.9% in the real data counterparts (data not shown). On average, each simulated set and its real
counterpart shared 12 of their top 20 species. The commonly used cutoff (UBLASTN top hit >50 bit score) was used for this illustration, which may yield
false-positive matches (see text). Abbreviations: Plancto, Planctomycetes; Bacteroi, Bacteroidetes; bact, bacterium. See also Supplementary Data

2 METHODS

Marine RefSeq database: To assign reads and contigs (simulated and real)
to marine taxa, we created a searchable, non-redundant database of all
known marine bacterial and archaeal protein sequences in NCBI RefSeq
(August 2012). The database included 2 585 466 sequences from 754 taxa.
See Supplementary Methods.

Simulated and real data: See Supplementary Data and Fig. 1.

Assembly: Intra-set assemblies were done with Roche’s GS de novo
Assembler (‘Newbler’) v2.7 and required read overlaps of :40 nt at
390% identity. Pooled assemblies used the same parameters. However,
because of the large number of reads (8 730 323) in the 42 real sets, we
pooled via an iterative approach in which contigs aggregated reads over
multiple rounds of assembly. Simulated sets were also assembled with
Genovo (Laserson et al., 2011) to investigate algorithm impact on chi-
merism. See Supplementary Methods.

Species annotation: To obtain conservative species calls for this discus-
sion (Section 3.3), we applied the following protocol, to real and simu-
lated data. Marine RefSeq was searched with each read or contig using
translated nucleotide UBLAST (Edgar, 2010) with E-value cutoff lE-l.
Only hits exceeding bit score 110 and 90% id were used for consensus-
based species calls. For reads, perfect species consensus of the hits was
required. For contigs, calls were made only if the species entropy of the
hits was 50.2427a 100-read contig with three minority reads, each from
a different species, would have this entropyiand only if the hits covered
>33% of the contig. (Coincidentally, Charuvaka and Rangwala (2011)
measured chimerism the same way.) For simulated sets, correctness of
consensus-based species annotation was evaluated by comparison with
the true species of the sequence. For reads, the source genome was always
known. For contigs, the true species was the majority species of the con-
stituent reads. See Supplementary Methods.

Estimating the odds of correct species calls: To compare the odds of
correct species calls for unassembled versus intraset-assembled versus
pooled-assembled reads, we counted correct and incorrect calls (but not

non-calls) for reads and contigs from the 10 simulated datasets. We also
modeled the impact of species unknown to Marine RefSeq (to estimate
the risk of incorrect species calls because of homologous hits in Marine
RefSeq) by creating 10 decoy sets in which non-marine NCBI RefSeq
genomes served as proxies for unknown marine species. Application of
Bayes’ Theorem produced the Figure 3 odds curves, with probabilities of
a correct or incorrect species call estimated from the observed counts. See
Supplementary Data and Methods.

Protein domain annotation: Open reading frames (ORFs) were called
on reads and contigs with FragGeneScan v1.16 (model 4S4_10 was used
allowing a 1% error rate; Rho et al., 2010) and used to search Pfam A
release 26.0 (Punta et al., 2012) with HMMER v3.0 hmmscan [default
parameters with trusted cutoff bit scores deﬁned for each hidden Markov
model (HMM); Eddy et al., 2009]. The per-domain ‘independent’ E-value
served as proxy for annotation conﬁdence. Hits to Pfam domains of
unknown function were ignored in our evaluation.

Gene family annotation: ORFs were also searched against PANTHER
8.1 (Mi et al., 2013) gene family and subfamily HMMs using the
PANTHER script pantherScore .pl. Reads were annotated only if
they or the contig they belonged to aligned to an HMM with E-value
<1E-23, recommended by PANTHER.

Pooled contig follow-up analyses: See Supplementary Methods.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Simulated sets approximated species diversity of
their real counterparts

To evaluate chimerism and annotation, we created simulated
metagenomic datasets from reference sequences (complete
genome sequences from known species). Simulated metagenomes
in which the provenance of individual reads is known have con-
tributed greatly to method development and discussion of

Reads in cunlig

Reads in contig

Fig. 2. Contig chimerism and its impact on species call correctness in simulated data. (A) Size and chimerism are shown for contigs from all 10 simulated
datasets, separately assembled. There were 549 species-chimeric contigs (A, left) and 19 400 species-homogenous contigs (A, right). For reference, the
black curves show the Shannon entropy if exactly one read differs in taxon from all others in the contig. The orange curves show entropy if a contig has
two minority reads each from a different taxon. Of the 549 (3% of 19 949) species-chimeric contigs, 513 have entropy 51 bit. There are 237 contigs within
0.01 bits of the black curve and 157 on the curve. Of the 19400 (97%) contigs that are chimeric below the level of species, 14019 (70%) have entropy 0
bits (not chimeric) and another 3160 have entropy 51 bit. Corresponding plots after pooled assembly are in the Supplementary Results. (B) Despite
chimerism species calls for reads, based on the calls for contigs into which they assembled, were usually correct. Pooled assembly of the 10 sets increased
the number of assembled reads (n) and nearly doubled the proportion of correct calls for reads in strain-chimeric contigs

experimental data in this field (Charuvaka and Rangwala, 2011;
Mavromatis et al., 2007; Mende et al., 2012; Pignatelli et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2014). To ensure that any impact of chimerism
in simulation is likely predictive for real data, we created 10
simulated sets (‘s’ prepended to names) using the program
MetaSim (Richter et al., 2008), based on the taxonomic profiles
of 10 real datasets in which 559 species (727 taxa) were identified.
Thus, we aimed to approximate speciﬁc real sets with respect to
species composition and total base pairs. In effect the simulated
sets included data from 317 species in total (~394 taxa; Fig. 1).
This deﬁcit in complexity, compared with the real sets, was
caused by MetaSim reaching the target dataset size before sam-
pling all genomes requested in each input profile. Nonetheless, to
our knowledge, our simulated sets are superior in complexity and
‘realism’ to previously published studies, and approximated their
real counterparts well, in aggregate and individually. Both in the
real and the simulated sets, a small number of identifiable species
contributed ~99.9% of the reads [63 species (real), 56 (simu-
lated), with 51 species in common]. Individually, each real set
and its simulated version overlapped by 12 species on average in
their respective 20 most abundant species (data not shown).

Several patterns are evident in Figure 1. First, many species are
found in several sets, as is evident from the nearly 10 datasets
shown in each species column. Indeed, 73% (230/317) of species
appeared in more than eight of the simulated sets. This was also
true of the real sets: 76% (425/559) of species appeared in more
than eight sets. Nine of the sets derived from subtropical or trop-
ical waters, four of them from the mid-Paciﬁc, but the high pro-
portion of shared species seems noteworthy nonetheless. This may
also reﬂect that marine environmental samples harbor many rare
species in the tail of their taxa distributions (Pedros-Alio et al.,
2006) and that homology-based species annotation at standard
stringency risks to (mis)associate their reads with a related species.
Based on this observation, we use only a highly conservative spe-
cies calling protocol in our analyses below (see Section 2).

Second, there is similarity across some sets for species within
the same genus. For example, sets s4441595.3 (gray), s4443699.3
(cyan), s4443701.3 (purple), s4440039.3 (red), s4443724.3 (light
green) and s4442464.3 (orange) show the same order by read
abundance of three Candidatus Pelagibacter species:
HTCC7211, ubique, IMCC9063. These proteobacterial species
are members of the SARll cluster, ubiquitous and abundant
in marine microbial communities (Morris et al., 2002), but
only 13 complete or near-complete Candidatus Pelagibacter gen-
omes have been released (seven of them of ubique strains). One
daring explanation for the pattern could be that just one unchar-
acterized Candidatus Pelagibacter species is actually present in
the real samples, which has three close relatives among the spe-
cies represented in our database (which is deemed ‘closest’ may
vary depending on which parts of the uncharacterized genome
are represented by the reads). This might be a more plausible
explanation than three species appearing in the same rank order
in six samples, which is also possible, of course. However, two of
the six datasets (44437243 and 44424643) are from distant
sample sites from the other four (mid-Paciﬁc). We cannot resolve
the cause conclusively but note that we found reminiscent rank
order patterns in the corresponding real datasets as well, while
for example Cyanobacteria seemed devoid of this phenomenon.
Our conservatism in species calling in the analyses described
below serves to ensure the validity of their results in either
case, although it necessarily leads to higher proportions of
‘non—calls’ than metagenomicists are used to seeing in the litera-
ture [50780% (Thomas et al., 2012)].

3.2 Assembly of simulated sets yielded mostly strain— and
few species-chimeric contigs

3.2.] Chimerism and impact on species calls Intuitively, we eat-
egorize chimerism at three levels: whether a contig combined
reads from different species, or different strains (from the same
species), or different individuals (cells). While it is extremely

relevant for biodiversity questions and even systems biology, the
third level is of less interest here (neither positively nor negatively)
than the ﬁrst two levels. Admittedly species and strain classiﬁca-
tion criteria can neither be expected to be straightforward, espe-
cially for microorganisms, nor consistent. However, this
distinction respects the taxonomical classiﬁcation of species, and
pursues our intuitive premise that strain chimerism will unlikely
impact on annotation negatively (when annotation protocols are
largely homology-based). When Newbler was used to assemble
the 10 simulated sets individually (‘intra—set’), with a minimum
required read overlap of 40 nt at 90% identity, i.e. standard par-
ameters, this yielded mostly small contigs (Fig. 2A; average N50
contig size of 1734:i: 897 nt), but of high quality, given the hun-
dreds of species present in each sample. Of the 19949 intra—set
contigs 97% (19 400) were species-homogenous and 70% (14 019)
were strain-homogenous (Fig. 2A). Only 3% (549) were chimeric
at the level of species or higher. Moreover, the degree of chimer-
ism, measured as Shannon entropy of the species or strains of the
reads within a contig in consideration of its length (plot in Fig.
2A), is low. For example, 157 of the 549 species-chimeric contigs
had only one read that differed in species from all others in the
contig. Accordingly, chimerism did not impact the correctness of
species calls made with our conservative protocol (see Section 2).
If we deﬁned the true species of a contig to be the majority species
of its reads (there was almost always a strong majority, which is
evident by the low entropies) few contigs elicited incorrect species
calls: 0 species-chimeric contigs and only 2 strain-chimeric contigs
(Fig. 2A), all short (<10 reads).

We noted that 43 reads received species calls before assembly
(i.e. ‘raw’ reads) that were challenged by the calls made for the
contigs into which they were later assembled. The contig-based
call was correct for 27 of these reads. These are marginal occur-
rences by reference to the data volume analyzed (~1.1 M total
reads in the 10 sets) of which >428K we found in contigs (Fig. 2B).

When probing dependency of our ﬁndings on the type of as-
sembler and data used (Supplementary Methods and Results;
Figs 8&87), we noted higher species-chimerism rates (10%) for
intra—set contigs with Genovo as a non-overlap-layout—consensus
(non-OLC) algorithm example. Species-misannotation with non-
OLC (8.7% as opposed to 0.0% with Newbler) was containable
by eliminating short contigs, but we recommend OLC. Generally,
assembly seems worthwhile for annotation if such caution is
applied, although the extent of improvement will vary.

Next, we assembled all 10 sets in a ‘pooled assembly’ (see
Section 2) and observed a modest increase in the number of
contigs (19 949 intra—set versus 21408 pooled; Fig. S4). This is
not surprising given that intra—set contigs that recruit additional
reads when pooled leave the count unchanged and intra-set con-
tigs that merge decrease the count, i.e. only newly assembled
reads from different datasets would be expected to increase the
contig count in our experiment. More relevant, the read count
assembled in contigs increased by 12% through pooling (429K
intra—set versus 559K pooled, Fig. 2B) and the proportion of in-
contig reads with correct species calls with our conservative spe-
cies caller nearly doubled (37% intra-set versus 73% pooled).
While we acknowledge that metagenomic contigs will mask
some diversity (Desai et al., 2012), these are striking improve-
ments due to pooling.

Prior probability that species of the read is known to Marine RefSeq

Fig. 3. Odds of correct species calls for reads that are unassembled,
intraset-assembled and pooled-assembled. The odds ratio curves account
for whether a read is from a species represented in Marine RefSeq or not.
Each gray curve is based on measured rates of correct and incorrect
species calls for unassembled reads in a simulated set and 10 decoy sets
(Supplementary Methods). Similarly black curves represent calls for
assembled reads. Only datasets for which >1% of reads assembled are
shown. The dashed curves show the mean odds ratios with no assembly
(gray), intra-set assembly (black), or 10 pooled assemblies with each set
withheld (bold). The solid bold curve shows the odds when all 10 sets are
pooled. The discs show the N50 contig size for each assembly and suggest
that the odds of a correct species call for a read increase with N50

3.2.2 Species calls with consideration of novel marine
species Figure 3 answers the question: Does assembly improve
the odds of a correct species call for a read, given that only a
fraction of species are represented in Marine RefSeq? The odds
ratio curves weigh correct against incorrect species calls, by
counting the reads in three categories: unassembled, intraset-
assembled and pooled-assembled. (Reads are not reﬂected if no
species calls were made with our conservative protocol (see
also Fig. 2B)). The six marine sets for which >1% of the reads
assembled show a clear improvement from unassembled (gray)
to intra-set (black), in step with the N50 contig size, i.e. the
higher the N50, the better the odds. The odds curve for pooled
assembly of all 10 sets (bold) is consistent with its N50 contig
size. This is consistent with a population of pooled contigs that
somewhat resembles the intra—set populations but has contigs
with more deeply aligned reads.

3.3 Assembly of 42 real datasets improved
species annotation

Encouraged by the low species-level chimerism we observed in
simulation, we selected 42 real marine microbial metagenomic
sets from the MG—RAST public repository (Meyer et al., 2008)
and assessed the impact of assembly on species identification. All
data were obtained with pyrosequencing (‘454’) technology.
Figure 4 (left panel) shows the proportion of reads that elicited

Fig. 4. Species, PANTHER and Pfam-A annotation changes because of intra-set and pooled assembly of real datasets. Left: Species call change
(quantity) relative to the total read count in each of the 42 real datasets. Intra-set bars are above the corresponding pooled assembly bars in each
pair. Datasets are sorted vertically by increasing intra-set N50 contig size (far right): 589 nt for 44400413, and 1711 nt for 44450663. Gray: reads that did
not assemble i.e. elicited annotation only as individual ‘raw’ reads. Colored: reads that assembled into contigs and elicited annotation (see legend).
Middle: A comparable graphic of gene family annotation increases for intra-set and pooled contigs, based on alignments to PANTHER HMMs, mirrors
the species results. Annotation increases with N50 with some of the same exceptions (e.g. 44400613). Right: Pfam-A domain annotation also increases
with assembly. This was especially pronounced for some sets with poor species and gene family annotation despite N50>0 nt (e.g. 4440061.3)

the proportions are illustrated as two bars, for intra—set (upper
bar) and pooled (lower) assembly, respectively. Sets are arranged
top to bottom by increasing degrees of assembly, measured as
intra-set N50 contig size (right panel), and tended to experience
greater increases in reads for which species calls were made (col-
ored) the more they assembled. The correlation between intra-set
call rate and N50 was strong (Kendall’s I = 0.53), in spite of
being impacted by some sets that assembled well but yielded
few (or no) species calls with our protocol (see below).

The percentage of new species calls (blue), i.e. calls possible
only after assembly, increased with intra—set N50 (I = 0.48; max
5.9% for 44440773). Pooling further increased the new call rate
(max 6.6% for 44440773) by adding reads to intra-set contigs or
creating new ones. In this context, the ratios of new calls to other
kinds (green, yellow) depend on the conservativeness of the spe-
cies caller, of course. A less conservative protocol would more
readily assign species to raw reads and thus preempt potential
new calls on assembly, though at a cost in misidentiﬁcations of
homologs for known species as we discussed above (Section 3.1).

Often, individual reads elicited species calls before assembly
(gray) that could be compared with calls based on contig mem-
bership. Usually, a contig-based call provided corroboration for
the same species as was called beforehand (green), and more so
for sets with a higher intra—set N50 (I = 0.57). Pooling increased
the proportion of corroborated calls in each set. For example, the
intra-set assembly of 44437153 produced contigs that supported
calls for 2.1% of reads in this set (green); pooled assembly
increased support to 4.1% of these reads. Pooling also tended
to increase the proportion of reads for which raw species calls
could not be corroborated (yellow), i.e. no call was made for the
relevant contig. On inspection, such contigs typically recruited
too few translated UBLAST hits from our Marine RefSeq

protein database to cover 33% of their length (required for a
species call, see Section 2). Rarely, a discrepancy arose between
the contig-based and the pre-assembly calls for a read (orange).
With these real data, we cannot ﬁrmly establish which (if either)
of the calls is accurate. However, from the trends observed with
simulated data (Fig. 3) it seems reasonable to predict that assem-
bly will have helped rectify an incorrect species assignment more
often than not.

The species annotation impact of pooling over intra—set assem-
bly for each dataset is also captured by the ratio of pooled to
intraset—assembled reads in a set (i.e. the ratio of colored regions
in Fig. 4). On average, pooling increased species calls by 15%
(minimum 0% for 44482263, maximum 57% for 44437113), in
the 27 sets with >0.5% total species calls. Novel species might be
responsible for the lack of improvement in the other 15 sets
where <0.5% of reads elicited a species call. These 15 sets also
yielded comparatively low annotation rates in MG—RAST
($26.1%). For example, sets 44400604, 44400613 and
44400673 received no calls by our species caller in spite of assem-
bling well (with N50 values of 991 nt, 1221 nt and 773 nt, respect-
ively). These sets derive from a phage study of marine
microbialites in which viral metagenomes from the same loca-
tions also had low annotation rates (>97% of reads unidentiﬁed;
Desnues et al., 2008).

gene ﬁunﬂy annotaﬁon

3.4.] Pfam-A protein domain annotation We investigated
whether assembly would improve annotation of Pfam-A do-
mains (Fig. 4, right panel). As with species calls, domain assign-
ments increased after assembly, in positive correlation with N50
(I = 0.75). Notably though, the number of post-assembly

domain assignments far exceeded those of species. For the 33
intra—set assemblies with acceptable N50 values, the proportion
of corroborated or new domain assignments was 0.140%
(mean = 10.6%), compared with the 0.(%12.5% (mean = 2.1%)
for species calls. Considering only new annotations, domain as-
signments ranged from 0.0729% (mean = 5.9%) and species
calls from 0.(%5.9% (mean = 1.0%). The conservation of do-
mains across taxa is illustrated nicely by this increase and
domain/family annotation is where we anticipated (and saw)
the potential beneﬁts of assembling chimeric contigs from close
relatives best reﬂected. Set 44400613 is an extreme example:
Neither raw reads nor contigs matched to the data/species
in Marine RefSeq, yet 30% of reads assembled into contigs for
which domain assignments resulted (using a standard HMMER3
protocol, see Section 2). Interestingly, for this set ~40% of the
domain assignments were to Bacteriophage Replication Gene A
(PF05840) and ~1% to Capsid Protein F (PF02305), possibly
reﬂecting an abundance of prophages, which were not in Marine
RefSeq.

Some reads that assembled could not be mapped to pooled
contigs for technical reasons (This caused the fractions of reads
in pooled-assembled contigs shown in Fig. 4 to fall below the
corresponding intra—set fractions (e. g. 44450663 Pfam domains),
even though we deﬁne pooling as a superset of intra—set results.
We note that the consequence with respect to our evaluation is
merely that the annotation gains depicted in Fig. 4 are in fact
underestimates.

3.4.2 PANTHER gene family annotation To gauge whether as-
sembly would improve identiﬁcation of multidomain protein
architectures (a step toward functional annotation), we used
raw and assembled reads in searches against PANTHER 8.1
gene family HMMs. The PANTHER results strongly mirrored
the species call results, as is evident in Fig. 4. Pearson correl-
ations corroborated this symmetry for total annotations
(rimmm = 0.68, rpm”, = 0.71) and also for only the new calls
enabled by assembly (blue; rimme, = 0.85, rpmled = 0.80). The
surprising symmetry between the plots was not reasonably
explained by shared reference species between PANTHER
HMMs and our database. Only ﬁve of the 147 PANTHER spe-
cies (UniProt Reference Proteomes) were in our database.
Therefore, the much higher annotation rates for gene families
versus species (Fig. 4) suggest that the PANTHER models iden-
tified contigs representing marine species not in our database.
For example, set 44450813 has few species calls (even in MG-
RAST, only 14.9% of reads have protein or rRNA annotation)
but many gene calls, likely because of conserved, homologous
genes in uncharacterized species.

3.5 Pooling—a prospect for species discovery?

Can pooled assembly of metagenomic data help discovery of
novel species, especially those that are ubiquitous? To answer
this, we ﬁrst checked whether pooled contigs that lacked species
calls by reference to our database MarineRefSeq, which is a
protein database and also excluded, e.g. marine viruses
(see Section 2), would perhaps elicit hits to NCBI RefSeq
genome data. We searched with all 3806 unannotated contigs
from pooled assembly with lengths >5kb using a CAMERA

Position in contig {hp}

Fig. 5. Pooled contig03272 was composed of reads from 12 samples from
four geographic regions: San Diego (SD), Monterey Bay (MB), western
English Channel (EC), near a Norwegian fjord (NF). Although reads
lacked signiﬁcant hits to reference databases, the contig was mappable
and may represent a novel, geographically diverse type of y proteobac-
terium. Ticks on the bottom axis show 76 positions where reads from
each geographic region were nearly unanimous but differed across re-
gions (as described in the text). These proportions are not likely to
occur by chance and may reﬂect geographically speciﬁc differences

BLASTN workﬂow (E—value<0.1, Sun et al., 2011). The vast
majority of the contigs (3688) failed to align at >80% sequence
identity over >80% of their lengths to any reference genomes
(3779 failed if 90% cutoffs were set). Thus, most of the contigs
likely represented novel microbial species.

To illustrate the potential of pooled assembly in this context,
we investigated a single pooled contig that lacked a species call,
contig03272, in detail. This 4388 bp contig was picked at random
from a list of contigs that had not elicited a species call, con-
tained reads from multiple samples, and were >4kb in length.
These criteria served to enrich for contigs that might represent
novel ubiquitous species and that would overlap multiple genes.
Our example contig03272 was built from 148 reads from 12 sur-
face water samples from widely separated oceanic regions
(Fig. 5). Read depth was relatively uniform (2 reads minimum;
mean = 8.9 reads) and all reads mapped to the contig
(BLASTN) over nearly their full lengths (96.5% minimum;
mean = 99.7%) and with high sequence identity (92.7% min-
imum; mean = 97.5%). Two computationally predicted protein
sequences aligned to over 78% of contig03272 (BLASTX search
of NCBI/nr, E—value <10), both of them proteins from SAR86
clade members (B and A): a Dehydroquinate Synthase (71% and
65% id) and a Membrane Carboxypeptidase/Penicillin—binding
protein (Mrca; 59% and 62% id). These predicted proteins are
encoded by neighboring genes in both SAR86 genomes. At the
time of analysis, these observations in combination suggested to
us that contig03272 might represent a geographically widespread,
novel marine microbe.

Indeed, during the preparation of this manuscript, a draft gen-
ome assembly for the y proteobacterium SCGC AAA076-Pl3
(NCBI BioProject accession PRJNA195664) was submitted to
the NCBI as results of a Joint Genome Institute (JGI) project
applying single-cell sequencing technology to 30 ubiquitous,

uncultured marine microbes. The timing is fortuitous, as the new
data corroborated both the ubiquity of the microbe represented
by contig03272 and that our contig had been assembled cor-
rectly. BLASTN of contig03272 against the draft SCGC
AAA076-P13 genome assembly yielded coverage of 97% of the
contig, in three match alignments with 97%, 97% and 95% se-
quence identity, respectively.

Interestingly, the draft genome assembly was based on a
sample collected in the Gulf of Maine, far from the four oceanic
regions that contributed to contig03272 (Fig. 5). As the latter
were widely separated, population-level differences between the
isolates of this new species (SCGC AAA076-P13) should be ap-
parent in our data. A cursory inspection of non-unanimous pos-
itions in the contig corroborated this. Of the 106 non-unanimous
positions covered by 38 reads, 76 were near-unanimous (we
allowed one read not to match) within oceanic regions.
Random reshufﬂing of the geographic labels in the same contig
(same read positions and label proportions), as a null model,
failed to attain this degree of segregation coincidentally (P B 0;
0 instances in 10000 trials).

4 CONCLUSIONS

While the notion that annotation (quality and quantity) should
improve with assembly is intuitive, this is to our knowledge the
ﬁrst deep effort at quantifying the beneﬁts of strain-chimeric
contigs from a practical perspective for metagenomics. In simu-
lation and for real datasets, we showed that intra-set and pooled
assembly of marine metagenomic data (i) produce chimeric con-
tigs that rarely violate marine species ‘boundaries’; (ii) lead to
quality and quantity improvements in species, protein domain
and gene family annotation; (iii) may help identify geographic-
ally diverse but novel species and population differences within
those species. We focused exclusively on data from pyrosequen-
cing (‘454’) efforts as the currently predominant type in marine
metagenomic repositories. However, most key concepts and the
strategy of our analyses are transferrable to other sequencing
technologies. With their read lengths now surpassing those
from the first ‘454’ generation, Illumina—sequenced sets may be
the next data to investigate.

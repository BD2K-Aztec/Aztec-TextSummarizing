ABSTRACT

Motivation: Somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) are frequent
in cancer genomes, but many of these are random, passenger events.
A common strategy to distinguish functional aberrations from passen-
gers is to identify those aberrations that are recurrent across multiple
samples. However, the extensive variability in the length and position
of SCNAs makes the problem of identifying recurrent aberrations no-
toriously difficult.

Results: We introduce a combinatorial approach to the problem of
identifying independent and recurrent SCNAs, focusing on the key
challenging of separating the overlaps in aberrations across individuals
into independent events. We derive independent and recurrent
SCNAs as maximal cliques in an interval graph constructed from over-
laps between aberrations. We efficiently enumerate all such cliques,
and derive a dynamic programming algorithm to find an optimal se-
lection of non-overlapping cliques, resulting in a very fast algorithm,
which we call RAIG (Recurrent Aberrations from Interval Graphs). We
show that RAIG outperforms other methods on simulated data and
also performs well on data from three cancer types from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (T CGA). In contrast to existing approaches that employ
various heuristics to select independent aberrations, RAIG optimizes a
well-defined objective function. We show that this allows RAIG to
identify rare aberrations that are likely functional, but are obscured
by overlaps with larger passenger aberrations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Copy number aberrations (CNAs) are gains and losses of large
segments of the genomeiranging in size from a few kilobases to
whole chromosomes. Somatic CNAs (SCNAs) that occur during
the lifetime of an individual are a major contributor to cancer
development, particularly for solid tumors (Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network, 2013; McLendon et al., 2008; The
Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Zack et al., 2013).

In the last decade, technologies with increasing resolution have
been introduced to measure CNAs. Cytogenetic techniques such
as comparative genomic hybridization were replaced by higher
resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
and SNP genotyping arrays, and most recently these are being
supplanted by high-throughput sequencing platforms. The latter
identify CNAs as deviations from the expected number of reads
aligned to an interval of the reference genome (Chiang et al.,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2008; Xi et al., 2010), and depending on the sequencing depth
and technology, can measure CNAs to single-nucleotide reso-
lution. In parallel with the technological developments, numer-
ous computational methods have been developed to identify
CNAs in single samples (Chiang et al., 2008; Hupé et al., 2004;
Olshen et al., 2004).

A key challenge in applying these technologies to cancer gen-
omes is that most SCNAs measured in tumor samples are
random, passenger events that do not contribute to the cancer
phenotype. A common strategy to distinguish functional, driver
aberrations from such random, passenger events is to identify
recurrent aberrations shared by multiple samples (Rueda and
Diaz—Uriarte, 2010). However, this is a notoriously difficult
problem because SCNAs vary widely in length and position
across different samples. For example, a tumor-suppressor
gene might be deleted by a small focal aberration in one
sample, while in another sample the same gene is deleted by a
whole chromosome loss. The varying size and starting/ending
positions of aberrations across samples create a complex pattern
of overlapping aberrations. This makes it difﬁcult to determine
which gene or genomic locus (if any) is the target of the aberra-
tion, a necessary prerequisite for any statistical test of recurrence.

Early methods for finding recurrent SCNAs used the straight-
forward approach of ﬁnding the minimum common region of
aberrations across samples (Aguirre et al., 2004). Subsequently,
numerous methods with more complex models were introduced
(Ben-Dor et al., 2007; Beroukhim et al., 2007; Diskin et al., 2006;
Magi et al., 2011; Mermel et al., 2011; Morganella et al., 2011;
Niida et al., 2012; Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2010; Walter et al.,
2011). While these methods differ in important details, they all
use variations of two basic steps: (i) compute a score at each
genomic locus (typically a probe in microarray datasets) indicat-
ing the recurrence; (ii) examine correlations between recurrences
scores of nearby loci to separate the true target region from other
close, high-scoring regions. In addition, some approaches also
compute the statistical signiﬁcance of the resulting predictions,
using either a fixed distribution or a permutation test that pre-
serves the lengths of SCNAs.

A major challenge in detecting recurrent SCNAs is that closely
located driver aberrations lead to correlations between the recur-
rence scores. For example, Figure 1 shows SCNAs in 20 samples.
The number of samples with an aberration at each locus gives a
recurrence score across the genome. However, these peaks are
correlated: e. g. the ﬁfth peak results largely from intervals shared
with the fourth and third peaks. Methods that predict recurrent
SCNAs must address the problem of how to separate peaks, or
high scoring regions, into independent copy number events. One
of the most-widely used methods, GISTIC (Beroukhim et al.,
2007), introduced a greedy procedure that removes the

Fig. 1. SCNAs in 20 samples with an interleaved pattern of overlapping intervals and three recurrent aberrations (Peaks 2, 3 and 4). Gray rectangles
represent locations of SCNAs in each sample. The aberration score (e.g. G-score or q-value from GISTIC) is shown in yellow and has ﬁve distinct peaks.
Greedy algorithms such as GISTIC/GISTIC2 select the highest scoring Peak 2 and then peel off the constituent intervals leaving Peak 4 as the next
highest score (red line). Blue line indicates the distribution of score after selecting Peak 4 in the second peel off. Peak 3 is not identiﬁed, although there are
four intervals starting immediately before Peak 3 (left intervals), eight intervals ending immediately after Peak 3 (right intervals), and one interval
satisfying both conditions (unique intervals). Numbers under each peak name indicate the number of (left, unique, right) intervals for that peak, which we
use for scoring in RAIG (Section 2). Note that each peak corresponds to a maximal clique in the interval graph representation (Fig. 2)

aberrations contributing to the highest peak, and then rescores
the remaining SCNAs, continuing this iterative procedure until
no more signiﬁcant peaks are found. While GISTIC has been
very successful in identifying recurrent SCNAs, the greedy nature
of the peel-off procedure reduces the sensitivity to discover real
secondary driver events if they are close to another primary
driver event.

JISTIC (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2010) and GISTIC2 (Mermel
et al., 2011) proposed alternative peel-off procedures with better
performance. GISTIC2 uses an arbitrated peel-off procedure
that rescores secondary peaks by assigning weights to intervals
in proportion to the number of peaks in which they contribute
(Fig. 1). While this approach considers the correlations between
high-scoring peaks, these correlations are considered in an itera-
tive manner: there is no attempt to globally maximize an object-
ive function. We observed that the peel-off procedure could fail
to detect high-scoring recurrent regions that were composed of
numerous intervals that are shared with other recurrent regions,
e. g. peak 3 in Figure 1. The continued development of peel-off
procedures emphasizes the difﬁculty in identifying recurrent
SCNAs, particularly secondary aberrations that are nested
within larger aberrations. Indeed, the overlap between the pre-
dictions from different methods is generally fairly small Wuan
et al., 2012). Moreover, the peel-off procedures implemented in
GISTIC, GISTIC2, JISTIC and related methods were originally
developed for microarray data and rely on markers (probes) to
deﬁne either boundaries or weights of peaks. This complicates
the application of these approaches to high-throughput sequen-
cing datasets.

At the same time, existing methods for identifying SCNAs do
not address the challenges of rare SCNAs that may not be stat-
istically signiﬁcant on their own. Recent cancer genome sequen-
cing studies have shown that a relatively small number of genes
are mutated at high frequency in a cohort of cancer patients with
many genes mutated at lower frequencies (Garraway and
Lander, 2013). This ‘long tail’ phenomenon implies that rare
mutations/aberrations cannot be discarded and require further
scrutiny. A promising approach to address this long tail is to

analyze combinations of mutations/aberrations in various signal-
ing and regulatory pathways (Ciriello et al., 2012; Leiserson
et al., 2013; Vandin et al., 2011, 2012). While rare somatic mu-
tations may be directly incorporated in pathway analyses, there is
no corresponding approach to identify rare SCNAs: most
approaches focus on the problem of identifying SCNAs that
are individually significant.

To address the limitations of current approaches in detecting
rare and secondary aberrations, we were motivated to develop a
new approach that identifies both recurrent and independent
SCNAs by optimizing a score that considers the composition
and the correlation between all SCNAs on a chromosome
across a set of samples. We introduce RAIG (Recurrent
Aberrations from Interval Graphs), an algorithm to detect inde-
pendent and recurrent SCNAs by selecting an optimal subset of
maximal cliques in an interval graph. In contrast to existing
approaches that deconvolve the recurrence score, RAIG analyzes
the combinatorial structure of the underlying intervals, and thus
explicitly models the dependencies between the values of the re-
currence score. RAIG uses a dynamic programming algorithm to
optimize a rigorous objective function for the selection of recur-
rent aberrations. Moreover, RAIG is very efficient, as maximal
cliques in an interval graph can be efﬁciently enumerated. We
show that our RAIG algorithm performs very well on both
simulated data and data from several cancer types from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In particular, RAIG has
higher sensitivity in detecting rare SCNAs and secondary aber-
rations that are missed by iterative peel-off procedures, while
also retaining high speciﬁcity. RAIG is simple and fast, and
readily adaptable for high-throughput sequencing data.

2 METHODS
2.1 Interval graph representation of SCNAs

As in most methods for analyzing recurrent SCNAs, we begin with a
collection of segmented copy number proﬁles from a set of individuals.
Thus, we assume that the copy number data from each individual has
been parsed into a collection of putative deletion and ampliﬁcation

The interval graph formed from SCNAs in (A). Each vertex vi) represents
the j—th aberration in sample i. Two vertices are connected with an edge if
their corresponding aberrations intersect. Vertices are colored according
to the common intersections in which the aberration is involved

intervals, using one of the many algorithms to segment copy number data
into intervals of equal copy number (e.g. Chiang et al., 2008; Hupé et al.,
2004; Olshen et al., 2004). Because we analyze interval data, rather than
probe data, our approach is readily applicable to microarray or high-
throughput sequencing approaches for measuring copy number.

The ﬁrst step in determining recurrent SCNAs is to ﬁnd regions of
common intersection between intervals across a subset of samples
(Fig. 2A). Here, we introduce a general approach to ﬁnding common
intersections. We model the intersections between segmented copy
number proﬁles using an interval graph G. For a chromosome arm A,
let G = (V,E) be a graph where each vertex v e V corresponds to an
interval in a sample and each edge e = (u, v) e E joins intervals that inter-
sect (Fig. 2B). Interval graphs are a special class of graphs and a number
of important optimization problems, that are generally NP-hard, can be
solved efﬁciently on interval graphs (Golumbic, 2004), a fact we will
exploit in our algorithm below. Although interval graphs have been
used many times in bioinformatics since Benzer’s experiments in bacterial
genes in the 19505 (Benzer, 1959), to our knowledge they have not been
used to model the problem of ﬁnding recurrent SCNAs.

A set of intervals containing a common region of intersection corres-
ponds to a clique in the interval graph G; i.e. a set of vertices with edges
between each pair, also known as a complete subgraph. Similarly, the
maximal set of intervals sharing a common intersection that cannot be
extended by adding an additional sample corresponds to a maximal
clique, a clique that cannot be extended with an additional vertex.
Finding all maximal cliques in general graphs is an NP-hard problem
(even ﬁnding a maximum clique in general is NP-complete), but one can
enumerate all maximal cliques in an interval graph in polynomial time
(Habib et al., 2000).

For each chromosome arm, we construct two separate interval graphs:
one for ampliﬁcations and one for deletions. We compute all maximal
cliques and order them according to their genomic location
C=(C1, C2, . . . , Cm). This ordering can be easily obtained by sorting
all interval endpoints, and scanning their common regions using a
sweep line algorithm from left to right [For instance see Habib et al.
(2000).] Similar to GISTIC2 (Mermel et al., 2011), we also deﬁne a
gene-level version of overlaps for deletions. That is, different portions

of a gene may be deleted in different individuals. We consider all such
events as deletions of the gene and thus we consider two deletion intervals
u and v as overlapping if at least one endpoint of u and one endpoint of v
are located within the same gene.

2.2 From maximal cliques to independent and recurrent
SCNAs

Each maximal clique Ck represents an aberration that is common to
multiple individuals, and corresponds to a peak in the recurrence score
plot (cf. Fig. 1). However, only a subset of these maximal cliques are
likely to be interesting SCNAs. For example, a single erroneous interval
in only one individual could create two maximal cliques from what
should be considered a single recurrent aberration. Figure 2 shows such
an example, where maximal clique C5 is determined by a single interval
v33 in sample 3. If this interval was deemed to be experimental error
rather than true SCNA and removed, then clique C5 would disappear.
Similarly, clique C3 is determined by a single interval v22 in sample 2. If
the endpoint of this interval was shifted slightly to the right (e.g. if the
segmentation was slightly off), then clique C3 would disappear. If both
errors occurred and C 5 and C4 were removed, then C4 corresponds to the
single common region of SCNA in most samples.

Thus, in addition to considering maximal cliques, we should also ana-
lyze maximal cliques that result after the removal, or shifting of end-
points, of a small number of erroneous intervals. Because the removal
of intervals, or shifting of interval endpoints, affects neighboring cliques
on the genome, we consider blocks of consecutive cliques. We propose an
algorithm that ﬁnds an optimal partition of maximal cliques into blocks
according to both the number of intervals that contribute to each max-
imal clique and the dependencies between these contributions.

2.3 Algorithm

Our RAIG algorithm examines maximal cliques, or small blocks of con-
secutive maximal cliques in C, as potential recurrent SCNAs. We deﬁne a
block 3,7 as an ordered list (C,,C,-+1, . . . ,C/) of consecutive maximal cli-
ques. Below, we deﬁne the score for each block. Our goal is to select a
collection of non-overlapping blocks whose total score (i.e. the sum of the
scores of each block in the collection) is maximized under the constraints
that the size of the blocks is not too large and the score of each block in
the collection is above a threshold. In the following sections, we formally
deﬁne our scoring scheme and optimization problem. Then we present an
efﬁcient algorithm to solve the problem.

2.3.] Scoring blocks Let C =(C1, C2, . . . , Cm) be the ordering of all
maximal cliques such that for every interval v, the maximal cliques con-
taining v are in consecutive order. Given the ordering C, for every clique
Ck, let ck be a coordinate such that ck belongs to all the intervals in Ck but
does not belong to any interval which is not in Ck. Note that because of
the deﬁnition of maximal cliques, for every k, such ck always exists and
we have c1<c2<~»<cm.

For a given interval v, let av be its left endpoint and let b, be its
right endpoint, respectively. We refer to av and b, as the boundary
endpoints of the interval. Given a maximal clique Ck, we deﬁne £(Ck) =
{vlck,1<aV 5 ck} and R(Ck)= {vlck 5 bv<ck+1}. In other words, £(Ck)
is the set of intervals whose left endpoints are located before ck but after
ck,1, while 72(Ck) is the set of intervals whose right endpoints are located
after ck but before ckt 1. The sets £(Ck) and 72(Ck) are the intervals that
make a contribution uniquely to clique Ck. Note that £(Ck) ﬂ 72(Ck) is
the set of intervals that are unique to Ck.

Analogously, given a block Bi) (i.e. consecutive cliques C,-,...,C,~),
we deﬁne [L(B,-J-)={v|c,-,1<aV 5 c,- and cf 5 b,} to be the set of inter-
vals whose left endpoint are located between Cial and C,-, and similarly
R(B,-,j)={v|cj 5 bv<cj+1 and aV 5 c,-} to be the set of intervals whose
right endpoints are located between C) and CH1. To deﬁne a score

the block W(Bj,2,j) is calculated from the left endpoints (green) and right

20) to compute optimal collection of non-overlapping blocks terminating
at the maximal clique j. Dashed green, solid red and dotted purple rect-

respectively, with the corresponding terminal clique from the previous
step of the recurrence. Scores W(Bj,1,j) and W(BjJ) are computed
using endpoints indicated by red and purple circles, respectively. In this
case, W(Bj,j) is the optimal selection

W(B,-},~) for the block Bi), we suppose that the block resulted from a single
recurrent SCNA, deﬁned by a single maximal clique Cp, called the pivot,
within the block Bi) (i.e. i 5p 5 j), and nearby cliques created by errone-
ous intervals/endpoints in some samples. Thus, to score the block Bil) with
pivot Cp, we count all the intervals that cross the pivot Cp, whose left
endpoints are located after cial but before c,- (for all i 5 p, where c,- is the
left boundary of the block), together with those intervals whose right
endpoints are located after c) but before cit] (for all j: p, where c) is
the right boundary of B”) (Fig. 3A). Our score W(B,-J) for the block
W(B,-J) is the number of such pairs of left and right endpoints, maximized
over all possible pivot cliques. Formally, we deﬁne:

W(BiJ')= max 2 X min  [,(BSJ’NJ U R(pre)l). (1)
P111111 s:[r,p] gum]

We count pairs of boundary endpoints because intervals that are
unique to Bi) are elements of both £13,0-) and 7209,31), and also to
avoid asymmetry where the number of left and right endpoints differs
drastically.

2.3.2 Finding an optimal block partition In this section, we formally
deﬁne the problem of finding an optimal selection of non-overlapping
blocks and present an efﬁcient algorithm to solve the problem. Each
selected block deﬁnes a target region of an independent SCNA.

Let P denote a selection of non-overlapping blocks Bil) according to
the ordering C. Each such selection P corresponds to a collection of
independent SCNAs. Our goals is to identify not only recurrent

aberrations in many samples (primary events), but also rare, secondary
aberrations that might be obscured by complex and overlapping segments
with primary events. Thus, we comprehensively consider all potential
selections of non-overlapping blocks. We score the selection as the sum
of the scores of each of the blocks in P whose score is above a minimum
threshold 8.

W(P)= Z) Watt), (2)

BUEP, W(B,-,/-)38

where W(B,-l,~) is the score of a block Bil) in the selection. The parameter 8

is used to reduce the possibility of over-partitioning that could result from

individual cliques with low scores preventing the creation of larger blocks.
We aim to solve the following problem.

PROBLEM 1. Given an interval graph G with maximal cliques
C =(C1, . . . , Cm), a minimum block score 8, and a maximum block size
r 5 m, find a selection P* of non-overlapping blocks such that for each block
Bid' E P*

(1) The score W(B,-,,~) Z 3;
(2) The block size j — i + 1 S r;

and such that the Score W(P*) is maximized over all such selections.

We solve this problem using dynamic programming. Let Z(j) be the
highest scoring selection of non-overlapping cliques from C1, . . . ,C/. Then
we have the following recurrence:

20 = { max (20‘ — 1)+ W(B,-,,-)) if W(B,-J-) 3 s,

. . (3)
Z(] — 1), otherw1se,

where i = j— r + 1,. . . ,1". We also have the initial condition Z(0) = 0.

The recurrence derives the best selection of non-overlapping blocks in
the ﬁrst j maximal cliques of the ordering C, using the optimal solution of
the ﬁrst j—l cliques. Since we take multiple consecutive cliques into
consideration, we have to consider an indicator i of the starting clique
of the block ending at j, where j — r + 1 5 i 5 j. Then we can get the best
selection of the first i cliques by calculating the score for all possible i,
which is the score Z(i — 1) of the best selection prior to i, plus the score
W(B,-l,~) of the block from i to j (Fig. 3B). Note that our algorithm is very
fast; knowing the ordering C1, . . . , Cm of the maximal cliques and scores
W(B,-]/~) of every block BM in advance, the dynamic programming step
takes only 0(mr), where r is the bound on the block size. Computing
the ordering C1, . . . , Cm of the maximal cliques requires 0(mlog m) by
employing a sorting procedure and a simple line sweep algorithm. Note
that m, the number of maximal cliques, is bounded by the total number of
intervals in all samples. Finally, computing the scores of all blocks Bi)
with their sizes bounded by r takes 0(mr2). Thus the total running time of
our method is 0(mlog m +mr2).

2.4 Deﬁning the target regions of aberrations
and assessing signiﬁcance

The ﬁnal tasks in the identiﬁcation of recurrent SCNAs are: (i) to deter-
mine the target region, or genomic location, of the aberration; (ii) to
identify the statistical signiﬁcance of the aberration. For a given block
W(B,-]/~) in the optimal selection P*, a natural choice of target region is the
minimal common region (MCR) (Aguirre et al., 2004), or the smallest
region contained in the intersection of all intervals that contributed to the
score of the block W(B,-},~). However, the MCR is often too restrictive, as it
is sensitive to the location of one or a small number of intervals; e.g. a
small, erroneous interval in one sample could produce a very small MCR.
Thus, we deﬁne a less restrictive target region by removing t pairs of left
and right boundary endpoints. Formally, for a block BL) with pivot C p, let
£(B,-J) be the descending ordered list of the positions of all left endpoints
in the set £(B,-J-), and let 7-209“) be the ascending ordering list of the

position of all right endpoints in the set 7209,31). The MCR of the block
Bil) is the ﬁrst element of C(BiJ) and the ﬁrst element of 7909,31). For
a given value t, we choose the region between the (t + 1)-th element of
C(33)) and the (t + 1)-th element of 7909“).

Finally, similar to other approaches (Beroukhim et al., 2007; Diskin
et al., 2006; Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2010; Walter et al., 2011), we assess the
statistical signiﬁcance of our predictions using a permutation test. We
used the cycle shift permutation from DiNAMIC (Walter et al., 2011)
that preserves the number and length of SCNAs in each sample, while
permuting their positions. The cycle shift permutation also preserves any
positional correlations between aberrations within a sample. We per-
formed the cycle shift permutation on all samples to deﬁne a permuted
collection of intervals R. Then for a predicted region B,- we deﬁne the
permutational P-value as

#R such that max];pr W(B) 3 W(B,-J-)
total number of permutations

If,

 

1709,31) = (4)

Note that this P-value is conservative as we compare the observed
score to the maximum score of block in the permuted data. Finally, we
compute a q-value using the BenjaminiiHochberg method.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulated datasets

We first compared RAIG with four other approaches: GAIA
(Morganella et al., 2011), JISTIC (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2010),
GISTIC (Beroukhim et al., 2007) and GISTIC2 (Mermel et al.,
2011) on simulated data. We used simulated data from
Morganella et al. (2011) that offers three SCNA scenarios and
two different noise models of increasing complexity that model
both uncertainty in the amplitude and the position of SCNAs
(both ampliﬁcations and deletions) in samples. A description of
the parameters of these simulations is in the Supplementary
Material. For each Scenario, we simulated a chromosome of
1000 probes considering SCNA widths of 100, 200 and 400,
and intensity noises 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1. To take the
amount of overlap with the true SCNA into consideration, we
count a prediction as correct if the predicted SCNA has 30%
reciprocal overlap with the true SCNA. As we varied the param-
eters of each method, we computed the precision as the fraction
of predictions that are correct and the recall as the fraction of
true SCNAs that are predicted. Supplementary Table S2.1 gives
the parameter settings for each method.

All methods performed very well (890% recall and precision)
on the ﬁrst noise model for all three scenarios (Supplementary
Fig. S1). On the second noise model, RAIG was the top per-
former across all three Scenarios achieving 99.2% recall and
98.2% precision in Scenario 1, 87.9% recall and 99.8% precision
in Scenario [1 (Supplementary Fig. S1), and 88.9% recall and
99.3% precision in Scenario [[1 (Fig. 4A). In comparison,
other methods cannot achieve such high recall and precision
based on 30% reciprocal overlap with the true SCNA. JISTIC
performed better than the other three methods, achieving 87.2%
recall and 85.3% precision in Scenario [[1 (Fig. 4A), but was still
below RAIG.

Other measures of performance are the sensitivity, deﬁned as
the fraction of genomic locations covered by true SCNAs that
overlap predictions, and the specificity, defined as the fraction of
genomic locations covered by predictions that overlap true
SCNAs. Unlike recall and precision, these measures do not

consider the number of predictions, and thus a method that frag-
ments SCNAs into many smaller predictions can perform well on
sensitivity and speciﬁcity. On the more complicated second noise
model, RAIG has better sensitivity than other methods and also
achieves high speciﬁcity: 99.3%, 97.8% and 97.6% in Scenarios
I, II and 111, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1).

To compare each method’s ability to identify overlapping sec-
ondary aberrations, we used two additional simulations. First,
we generated a third simulated dataset consisting of three over-
lapping SCNAs, analogous to peaks 2, 3 and 4 in Figure 1. In
this simulation, a simulated chromosome contains three recur-
rent aberrations of length 200 probes across 25 samples. The
three aberrations are at the median position of the chromosome
to minimize edge effects and with a fixed distance 25 probes
between them. We introduced normally distributed amplitude
noise (a = 0.25) and spatial noise obtained by resizing and shift-
ing the middle aberration as in Morganella et al. (2011). Finally,
we simulated 100 chromosomes for this dataset and examine its
precision and recall for different approaches.

Requiring a minimum of 30% reciprocal overlap between true
and predicted aberrations, we found that RAIG outperformed
all other methods (Fig. 4B). In particular, RAIG obtained 97%
recall and 99% precision. In comparison, GISTIC, JISTIC and
GAIA all obtained a recall of 66.7% in its favorable case, with
100% precision. The reason for the low recall is because these
methods detected the outer two SCNAs, but could not detect the
middle SCNA, due to their use of iterative/greedy peel-off pro-
cedures. The arbitrated peel-off procedure used in GISTIC2 per-
formed better (recall of 77.3% and 99.1% precision) since it gave
more weight to the middle aberration, but its performance was
still signiﬁcantly below RAIG.

Finally, we generated a simulated dataset using that same ap-
proach that was used in the GISTIC2 publication (Mermel et al.,
2011) to demonstrate the superiority of the GISTIC2 arbitrated
peel-off procedure over the earlier greedy peel-off procedure used
in GISTIC. In this simulation, we follow the steps in the
GISTIC2 publication (Mermel et al., 2011) to generate simulated
chromosomes in 500 samples, including a primary driver event, a
secondary driver event and passenger events presenting in 10%,
5% and 85% of samples. Each passenger event is chosen
randomly from the collection of 4508 cancer samples from
Pan-cancer dataset (Weinstein et al., 2013) and placed on the
chromosome with uniform midpoint. We considered recently dis-
covered Pan-cancer driver events (Zack et al., 2013) as the known
driver events for generating lengths and amplitude of driver
SCNAs. We considered different overlaps between the primary
and secondary driver events from 100% (complete dependence
where all intervals contain both aberrations) to 0% (complete
independence where no intervals contain both aberrations). For
each overlap fraction, we created 1000 simulated datasets, each
with 500 samples, and examined its percentage recovery of the
secondary driver event. When the overlap between primary and
secondary driver events is low (<50%), RAIG has a clear advan-
tage over GISTIC2 in recovering more secondary driver events
than GISTIC2 (Fig. 4C). In the more difﬁcult case where the
overlap between primary and secondary and driver events is high
(>50%), RAIG and GISTIC2 recover similarly low proportions
of secondary events.

3.2 Cancer datasets

We compared RAIG with other approaches on three recent
cancer datasets from TCGA: 563 Glioblastoma Multiforme
(GBM) samples, 490 Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma
(KIRC) samples and 847 Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA)
samples. We downloaded segmented copy number data from
Broad Institute’s Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC). We
considered only focal events by setting a cutoff to distinguish
broad from focal events, i.e. only considering SCNAs whose
lengths are <90% of chromosome arm. We compared the recur-
rent regions identiﬁed by three different methods: GISTIC2,
GAIA and RAIG, running each of the first four methods with
their default settings and selecting predictions with q—value <0.5.
For the parameters of each method, please see Supplementary
Table S2.1.

Overall, we ﬁnd that while RAIG and GISTIC2 predict ap-
proximately the same number of SCNAs, the SCNAs predicted
by GISTIC2 are >1(%20—fold larger (Table 1). We observe a fair
amount of overlap between the predictions from different meth-
ods, and also many predictions that were unique to a single
method or pairs of methods (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S2).
Since the driver aberrations in these samples are not known, to
compare the performance of the methods we also examined the
fraction of each predicted SCNA that overlaps genes from the
Sanger Institute Cancer Gene Census (Forbes et al., 2011), a list
of known cancer genes. Because the SCNAs predicted by RAIG
are smaller than other methods, we ﬁnd fewer census genes.
However, a signiﬁcantly larger fraction of RAIG’s predictions
overlap census genes, suggesting that RAIG has high speciﬁcity.
Moreover, many of the additional census genes found by
GISTIC2 and GAIA are in large SCNAs that contain many
genesiboth census genes and non-census genes. We further
detail these results in the following sections.

3.2.] GBM RAIG detected 71 recurrent ampliﬁcations and 50
recurrent deletions, compared with 70 ampliﬁcations and 50 de-
letions for GISTIC2 and 44 ampliﬁcations and 160 deletions for
GAIA. Comparison of the predictions revealed 24 regions

reported by all three methods (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig.
S2A, Supplementary Table S1.1). Most of these shared regions
contain well-known cancer genes and are highly consistent with
the previous studies (Beroukhim et al., 2007; McLendon et al.,
2008), including ampliﬁcations in PDGFRA, MET, CDK6,
M YCN, SOX2, MDM4, MDMZ and CDK4; ampliﬁcations
close to EGFR; and deletions in NF], CDKNZA, CDKNZC
and PTEN.

RAIG, GISTIC2 and GAIA predictions included 25, 78 and
50 census genes, respectively. However, the increase in number of
census genes for GISTIC2 and GAIA comes with a cost:
GISTIC2 and GAIA predictions are longer on average than
RAIG predictions and GAIA makes many more predictions
(Table 1). Thus, we computed the number of census genes iden-
tiﬁed per Mb in predicted regions and found that RAIG predic-
tions were signiﬁcantly enriched for census genes: including
nearly 1.41 genes/Mb compared with 0.19/Mb for GISTIC2
and 0.3/Mb for GAIA. Seen another way, the percentage of
prediction covered by a census gene is significantly greater for
RAIG (32.6%) compared with the other methods (1.9% and
3.7%). Supplementary Figure S4A compares the lengths of
RAIG and GISTIC2 predictions containing several well-known
genes including PTEN, CDKNZA and MDM4. Overall, we find
that RAIG makes smaller predictions that are more focused on
the known target genes of the aberrations compared with
GISTIC2 and GAIA.

We also found that several of the predictions that are unique
to RAIG contain genes with reported associations to cancer,
although not in the Cancer Gene Census. One example is a
focal deletion of RSUI, a suppressor of RAS. RAS loss of func-
tion plays a key role in GBM (Tsuda et al., 1995). RSU] dele-
tions are rare (found in only 10 of the 563 samples) and these
deletions accumulate at C-terminus of RSU] (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Another rare aberration unique to RAIG is an ampli-
fication of VEGFA (found in only 18 of the 563 samples), a
signature gene of the ‘mesenchymal’ GBM subtype that was
more highly expressed in one of signaling patterns in GBM
(Brennan et al., 2009).

3.2.2 KIRC RAIG predicted 12 recurrent ampliﬁcations and
24 recurrent deletions (using gene-level overlap scoring for dele-
tions), compared with 9 ampliﬁcations and 17 deletions for 31.3Mb —
GISTIC2 and 20 ampliﬁcation and 35 deletions for GAIA.
Comparison of the predictions revealed six regions reported by
all three methods (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Fig. S2B,
Supplementary Table S12). Most of these shared regions contain 88-3Mb '
well-known cancer genes and are highly consistent with the pre-
vious studies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013).
These include deletions of tumor—supressor genes CDKN2A at
9p21, PIK3CA at 3q26, RUNX3 at 1p36 (Beroukhim et al.,
2009), chromatin remodeling gene ARIDIA at 1p36.11, and (mMAPzKHnBreastCmer
PT PRD at 9p23. ARIDIA was recently reported to be a new MAp2K4

prognostic marker in KIRC (Lichner et al., 2013). However,
while GISTIC2 predicts a large 31.2Mb deletion at 1p36.33-
p35.2 that includes ARIDIA and 7 other census genes, RAIG
predicts a more speciﬁc 2.24 Mb deletion containing only
ARIDIA (Fig. 6A). A similar example is ampliﬁcation of
MDM4, which is contained in a large 88.2 Mb ampliﬁcation
predicted by GISTIC2, but a 1.18 Mb ampliﬁcation in RAIG
(Fig. 6B).

Some of the recurrent regions identiﬁed by at least two meth-
ods have been reported in previous studies, e.g deletions in
NEGRI at 1p31, NRXN3 at 14q24 and PTEN at 10q23

cancer. However, these smaller aberrations were not signiﬁcant,
likely due to the whole arm aberrations that lead to a relatively
ﬂat permutational distribution using the cycle-shift permutation.
While these rare aberrations were not statistically signiﬁcant on
their own, they can be analyzed in combination with other mu-
tations/aberrations using pathway and network analyses (Ciriello
et al., 2012; Leiserson et al., 2013; Vandin et al., 2011, 2012).

3.2.3 BRCA RAIG detects 47 ampliﬁcations and 41 deletions
(using gene-level overlap scoring for deletions) compared with 62
ampliﬁcations and 51 deletions for GISTIC2 and 114 ampliﬁca-
tions and 132 deletions for GAIA (Fig. 5C, Supplementary Fig.
S2C, Supplementary Table S1.3). Altogether, there are 28 regions
common to the three methods (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These
regions include previously reported recurrent SCNAs (The
Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012) such as: focal ampliﬁca-
tion of regions containing C CNDI , ERBBZ, M YC, MDM4 and
ZNF703; ampliﬁed regions near ZNF2I7, GATA3 and FOXAI;
and focal deletion of regions containing FOXP1, CSMDI, RBI,
PTEN, CDKN2A, PTPRD, MAP2K4 and MLL3. Moreover,
RAIG and GISTIC2 identiﬁed an ampliﬁed region containing
ESRI; activating mutations in ESRI were recently reported to be
a key mechanism in breast cancer (Robinson et al., 2013).

We observe a similar result as in the GBM dataset. While
GISTIC2 and GAIA predictions contain more census genes,
their predictions are larger. The result is that RAIG has 33-
fold census genes/Mb than the other methods (Table 1). Seen
another way, the percentage of prediction covered by a census
gene is signiﬁcantly greater for RAIG (50.3%) compared with
the other methods (1.9% and 2.1%). For example, GISTIC2
predicts a 13.6 Mb deletion with census genes FOXP1 and
MITF, while RAIG predicts a speciﬁc deletion with the size
0.62Mb containing only FOXP1 (Fig. 6C). A similar example
is deletion of MAP2K4, which is contained in a relatively large
0.56 Mb deletion in GISTIC2 output but a 0.06 Mb deletion in
RAIG (Fig. 6D).

RAIG identiﬁed some important regions listed as follows
which are not identiﬁed by the other methods. A notable ex-
ample is a rare deletion of RUNXI (Fig. 7) in 33 samples
(|L(C)| = 16 and |R(C)| = 21). Deletion of RUNXI is consistent
with previous reports of inactivating mutations in RUNXI in
breast cancer (Banerji et al., 2012).

4 DISCUSSION

We introduce RAIG, an algorithm to ﬁnd independent and re-
current SCNAs. We demonstrate that RAIG performs well com-
pared with the existing methods on synthetic and real datasets.
On simulated datasets, RAIG achieved the highest precision and
recall, and also made smaller, more focused predictions. On real
datasets, RAIG predicted independent and recurrent SCNAs in
a significantly smaller fraction of the genome than the widely
used GISTIC2 algorithm and the GAIA algorithm. Overall,
the overlap between different methods is modest, demonstrating
the difﬁculty in identifying recurrent SCNAs. RAIG showed the
highest enrichment of known cancer genes from The Cancer
Gene Census, suggesting that RAIG has high speciﬁcity. While
it is difﬁcult to estimate the sensitivity of each method on real
data, we found that a number of the genes that were unique to

Fig. 7. Rare deletion identiﬁed by RAIG in RUNXI in BRCA. Genes are
dark gray rectangles at top while RAIG prediction is orange rectangle.
Contributing SCNAs are those interval that contribute to the score W for
the recurrent region (maximal clique), while other SCNAs are intervals
that do not contribute score. There are 5 left, 11 unique and 10 right
intervals indicated by light blue, dark blue and cyan in the CNA panel,
respectively, that contribute to the RUNXI score, i.e. [3(3): 16 and
72(3) = 21

RAIG are known cancer genes. Finally, the efﬁcient clique enu-
meration and optimization steps make RAIG perform more than
thousand times faster than other methods, although total run-
ning times are inﬂuenced by the type of nature of the statistical
test that is performed (Supplementary Table S2.2).

At the same time, RAIG does miss some SCNAs that likely
contain important cancer genes. In examining these cases, we
found that the majority had relatively few boundary endpoints
that surround the maximal clique containing these genes.
However, the amplitude of the SCNAs in these samples was
very high. One example is FGFRI in BRCA, where the average
frequency and amplitude are 0.12 and 0.98, respectively. We
found that other intervals (with lower amplitude) obscure the
high-amplitude intervals containing FGFRI. GISTIC2 use copy
number amplitude in addition to number of samples for its re-
currence score. Further improvements to RAIG may be obtained
by running with higher amplitude thresholds, or by incorporat-
ing amplitude into the objective function optimized by RAIG;
e. g. by creating a weighted score for intervals according to their
amplitude. To test the former hypotheses, we ran RAIG on the
BRCA dataset using only intervals whose amplitude was >05.
RAIG returned a region on 8p containing FGFRI and two other
genes.

Since RAIG considers all possible partitions of the data, it is
able to detect rare SCNAs and secondary events that are
obscured by complex, overlapping rearrangements and missed
by iterative peel-off procedures used in all existing methods.
Although such rare aberrations are not statistically significant
on their own, one of the outcomes from recent cancer sequencing
studies is the demonstration of extensive mutational heterogen-
eity in cancer with driver mutations distributed over a large
number of genes (Vogelstein et al., 2013). Thus, obtaining a
comprehensive view of the mutations that drive cancer requires
the analysis of combinations of rare and common mutations in
pathways and interaction networks (Cerami et al., 2010; Ciriello
et al., 2012; Leiserson et al., 2013; Vandin et al., 2011, 2012;
Vaske et al., 2010).

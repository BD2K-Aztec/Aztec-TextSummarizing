1 Introduction

Haplotype refers to a group of alleles inherited together on a single
chromosome (Browning and Browning, 2011). Haplotype is essen—
tial for mapping disease signals, finding functional cis—acting loops
among non—coding elements, imputing the missing values in big
data. Genotypes can be obtained directly from high—throughput gen—
otyping or next—generation sequencing, but haplotypes cannot be
obtained directly. Given that current high—throughput haplotyping
technologies are still expensive (Fan et (11., 2011; Kirkness et (11.,
2013; Kitzman et (11., 2011; Kuleshov et (11., 2014; Ma et (11., 2010;
Rao et (11., 2013; Selvaraj et (11., 2013; Suk et (11., 2011; Yang et (11.,
2011) and statistical haplotyping approach suffers from ambiguities
(Browning and Browning, 2011; Li et (11., 2010; Liu et (11., 2008;
Niu et (11., 2002; Qin et (11., 2002), phasing by pedigrees is the most
cost—effective and accurate approach for haplotype determination
whenever pedigree genotypes are available (Chen et (11., 2013). Most
of the phasing programs by pedigrees assume zero or minimal re—
combinations and difficult for large complicated and looping pedi—
grees (Abecasis et (11., 2002; Druet and Georges, 2010, 2015; Gao

et (11., 2009; Kong et (11., 2008; Kruglyak et (11., 1996; Li and Li,
2009; O’Connell, 2000; O’Connell et (11., 2014; Sobel and Lange,
1996; Zhang et (11., 2005). The lack of efficient and accurate meth—
ods for long—range haplotype determination has hampered the func—
tional interpretation of non—coding cis—acting elements in human
genome. Here, we present a computational tool, GenomeLaser, to
reconstruct personal haplotypes from unphased genotypes, it can
also handle the looped pedigrees and missing genotype data.

2 Features

Pedigree dissection is the central switchboard throughout the entire
procedure (Supplementary Fig. 51). Large pedigrees will be first dis—
sected to nuclear families. If a person is shared by two nuclear fami—
lies, he/she will be included in both nuclear family units. In the
algorithm of Laser 1, each nuclear family will be further dissected
into trios (Supplementary Fig. S2). A nuclear family with 71 children
will be dissected into n trios. If only one parent is recruited in a
study, the parent—child pair will be used. Then the child haplotypes

resolved in Laser I will be sent back to the pedigree dissection algo—
rithm, in which children’s haplotypes inherited from the same parent
will be grouped (Supplementary Fig. S2) and sent to the Laser II al—
gorithm. In case that a person has children in more than one nuclear
family, all of his/her children in different nuclear family units Will be
grouped together.

The algorithm of GenomeLaser is based on the Mendelian
Law of Inheritance (Hodge et (11., 1999). It is composed of four com—
ponents, pedigree dissection, Laser I, Laser II and Laser III
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

Laser I resolves child haplotypes. It first determines the allele ori—
gins of the child using parental genotypes (Supplementary Tables S1
and S2) (Hodge et (11., 1999). For example, when a child is AG, his/
her mother is AA and father is AG, under the Mendelian Law of
Inheritance, the G allele must come from father and thus the A allele
must be inherited from mother. After Laser I determines the parental
origin of each allele, all maternally originated alleles will be grouped
together and constitute the haplotype of the chromosome inherited
from his/her mother and all paternally originated alleles will be
grouped and constitute the haplotype of the chromosome inherited
from his/her father. If all three members (mother, father, child) of a
trio are heterozygous at a single—nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
locus, Laser I will output XX at the triple—heterozygous SNP site on
the child haplotypes of this trio.

Laser II resolves parental haplotypes. It first groups the child
haplotypes inherited from the same person and then compares the
nucleotide sequences among these child haplotypes. A zebra pattern
will appear in which identical parts (all alleles are the same) and
non—identical segments (all alleles are different) will separate each
other along a chromosome. The boundary between an identical seg—
ment and an opposite segment will indicate a crossover breakpoint
occurred in either gamete of these two children. Laser II then cut
the children’s haplotypes into pieces at these boundaries and re—
assemble them into two chromosomal haplotypes (Fig. 1).

After Laser II, there are some loci (8.7 i 5.9% of all SNPs)
that are still labeled as NN or XX due to missing data or triple—
heterozygotes. Laser III will impute all of those NN and XX sites
with an additional input, the reference panel, using the phase—
resolved loci by Laser I and II as seeds into Laser III. The algorithm
for Laser III was the same as HiFi, whose algorithm was described
in a previous publication (Rao et (11., 2013).

The Laser program is coded in Python. The input files include
the pedigree relationship, genotypes and an imputation reference
panel. The output will be two haplotypes of each person.

To examine the performance of the Laser program, we cre—
ated a simulated dataset containing 30 nuclear families (150 indi—
viduals, 116 415 SNPs) in a pedigree structure of two parents and
three children (Supplementary Methods) and resolved the haplo—
types of all members in this pedigree dataset. Missing data (NN)
was introduced into the simulated genotypes at randomly se—
lected loci. The results showed that accuracy was >99.99%, and
the error rate was 0.003% on parental haplotypes and 0.0009%
on child haplotypes (Supplementary Table S3). We then created
two simulated complicated pedigrees and resolved the haplotypes
of all members (Supplementary Fig. S3). The results showed that
accuracy was 99.99%, and the error rate was 0.002%
(Supplementary Table S4). Its accuracy is substantially higher
compared with other software for phasing pedigrees. We further
examined the computing speed on a regular desktop computer
(Intel Core i7—2600K CPU at 3.40 GHzx8, 31.3 GB RAM). The
computing time of Laser is linear to the number of Trios
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

3 Conclusion

GenomeLaser provides an efficient computational tool for deter—
mination of molecular haplotypes from unphased genotype data in
pedigrees. Accurate chromosome—range personal haplotypes will
be extremely useful to explore those long—distance cis—regulatory
networks and epigenetic controls of chromosome function. It is
not suitable for those scenarios (such as very small genomic re—
gions) in which pedigree information are not available. Brieﬂy,
Laser III may be affected by admixture. Laser I and Laser II are
based on the Mendelian Law of Inheritance and they will not be af—
fected by genetic admixtures, but Laser III is a reference—based im—
putation, it will be affected by the admixture. The performance
may be improved by the following operations. First, locus—specific
ancestry may be determined in parallel with GenomeLaser to
monitor the admixtures (Ma et (11., 2014). Second, the reference
panels should be either chosen according to the admixture back—
ground or based on the pooled reference panels (Huang et (11.,
2009). The statistical haplotyping approaches also use similar
strategies to improve imputation performance for admixed sam—
ples by either improving the algorithm or careful selecting refer—
ence panels (Huang and Tseng, 2014; Krithika et (11., 2012; Liu
et (11., 2013; Zhang et (11., 2011).

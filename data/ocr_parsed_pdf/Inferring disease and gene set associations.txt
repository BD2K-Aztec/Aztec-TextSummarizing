ABSTRACT

Motivation: To validate the candidate disease genes identified from
high-throughput genomic studies, a necessary step is to elucidate
the associations between the set of candidate genes and disease
phenotypes. The conventional gene set enrichment analysis often
fails to reveal associations between disease phenotypes and the
gene sets with a short list of poorly annotated genes, because
the existing annotations of disease-causative genes are incomplete.
This article introduces a network-based computational approach
called rcNet to discover the associations between gene sets and
disease phenotypes. A learning framework is proposed to maximize
the coherence between the predicted phenotype—gene set relations
and the known disease phenotype-gene associations. An efficient
algorithm coupling ridge regression with label propagation and two
variants are designed to find the optimal solution to the objective
functions of the learning framework.

Results: We evaluated the rcNet algorithms with leave-one-out
cross-validation on Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) data
and an independent test set of recently discovered disease—gene
associations. In the experiments, the rcNet algorithms achieved best
overall rankings compared with the baselines. To further validate
the reproducibility of the performance, we applied the algorithms
to identify the target diseases of novel candidate disease genes
obtained from recent studies of Genome-Wide Association Study
(GWAS), DNA copy number variation analysis and gene expression
profiling. The algorithms ranked the target disease of the candidate
genes at the top of the rank list in many cases across all the three
case studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Determination of the molecular cause of diseases is a major focus in
genomics research since early 1960s (McKusick, 2007). Recently,
powered by the advanced high-throughput genomic technologies,
numerous large-scale genome-wide disease studies such as genome-
wide association studies (Johnson and O’Donnell, 2009; The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007), DNA copy

number detections (Shlien and Malkin, 2009) and gene expression
proﬁling (van’t Veer and Bemards, 2008) were conducted toward
this goal. Typically, the objective of a study is to perform a high-
throughput scanning for a list of genes that are involved with the
disease under study, and then a standard follow-up enrichment
analysis or its variants and extensions is applied to analyze the gene
set, based on the statistical signiﬁcance of the overlap between the
genes and gene functional annotations or associations with disease
phenotypes. Examples of the well-known tools are DAVID (Huang
et (11., 2009), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), GOToolBox (Martin
et al., 2004) and many others. However, in many cases, since the
existing annotations of disease-causative genes is far from complete
(McKusick, 2007), and a gene set might only contain a short list of
poorly annotated genes, enrichment-based approaches often fail to
reveal the associations between gene sets and disease phenotypes.

The availability of large phenotypic and molecular networks
provides a new opportunity to study the association between diseases
and the gene sets identiﬁed from the high-throughput genomic
studies. The human disease phenotype network (van Driel et al.,
2006) provides information on phenotype similarities computed by
text mining of the full text and clinical synopsis of the disease
phenotypes in OMIM (McKusick, 2007). Large molecular networks
such as the human protein—protein interaction network (Chuang
et al., 2007) or functional linkage network (Linghu et al., 2009)
provide ﬁmctional relations among genes or proteins. Based on the
observation that genes associated with the same or related diseases
tend to interact with each other in the gene network, many network-
based approaches are proposed to utilize the disease modules and
gene modules in the networks to prioritize disease genes, a task of
ranking genes for studying genetic diseases (Franke et (11., 2006;
Hwang and Kuang, 2010; Kohler et al., 2008; Linghu et (11., 2009;
Li and Patra, 2010; Vanunu et (11., 2010; Wu et al., 2008).

In this article, we propose a general network-based approach
to infer associations between disease phenotypes and gene sets,
utilizing the disease phenotype network and the gene network. We
formulate the problem as a gene set query problem. By querying the
networks with a given gene set, a user expects to retrieve a list of
disease phenotypes with the highest predicted association with the
gene set. The principle is that, if genes are ranked by their relevance
to the query gene set, and disease phenotypes are ranked by their
relevance to the hidden target disease phenotypes of the query
gene set, the known associations between the most relevant genes
and phenotypes tend to be over-represented compared with random
cases. We formulate a simple learning framework maximizing Rank

Fig. 1. Illustration of Rank Coherence in Networks. A query gene set of four genes is given in (A). The four genes are mapped in the gene network and the
corresponding nodes are marked with l in (B). The graph Laplacian scores are then computed to quantify the relevance between each gene (including the

query genes) and the query gene set. In (D). if a disease phenotype is selected as the candidate target phenotype and marked with l. the graph Laplacian scores
can also be derived to quantify the relevance between each disease phenotype and the selected phenotype. We contrast the case with the target phenotype
selected (the upper case) to the case with an unrelated phenotype selected (the bottom case) in (D) to demonstrate the difference in the relevance scores. As
showed in (C). the known OMIM associations are represented as the dashed edges connecting the associated phenotype and gene. Based on the coherence

assumption. similarly ranked genes and phenotypes in the two networks should be highly connected with each other in the upper case. and the connectivity
will be close to random in the bottom case. The edges connecting associated genes and phenotypes are labeled by the discrepancy between their ranking

scores. Clearly. the phenotype ranking given by the relevance to the target phenotype is more coherent than the ranking given by the relevance to an unrelated

phenotype.

Coherence in Networks (rcNet) with respect to the known disease
phenotype—gene associations in OMIM.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

Figure 1 illustrates the general idea of Rank Coherence in Networks. We
ﬁrst measure the relevance between the query gene set and all the genes
with graph Laplacian scores (Fig. 1A and B). The Laplacian scores can be
considered as the result of using the query gene set as the seed to perform
random walk with restart (or label propagation) in the gene network (Bengio
at al.. 2006). Thus. the relevance is global because the full network is
used to derive the Laplacian scores. The global relevance between a target
disease phenotype and all disease phenotypes can be similarly computed as
the Laplacian scores with random walk on the disease phenotype network
(Fig. 1D). Our assumption is that. between the rankings given by the query
gene set and the target disease phenotype. the top-ranked genes and the
top-ranked phenotypes should be highly connected by known associations.
quantiﬁed by Rank Coherence in Networks (Fig. 1C). In a real problem. the
target disease phenotypes are unknown. The rcNet algorithms are designed to
search for the phenotype(s) with the best rcNet score against the query gene
set. We propose two strategies. The ﬁrst approach relaxes the combinatorial
problem as ridge regression to ﬁnd a closed-form solution for selecting the

target disease phenotypes. The second approach in two variants enumerates
all phenotype conﬁgurations to ﬁnd the best match of the query gene set.

2.2 Problem deﬁnition

We formulate a graph query problem for disease phenotype and gene set
association discovery. Given a heterogenous network consisting of the gene
network. phenotype network and association network. we query the network
with a gene set to retrieve a phenotype (or several) predicted to have
association with the query gene set. We deﬁne Gmxn). P<mxm). and Amxm)
as the adjacency matrix of the gene network. the disease network. and the
diseaseegene association network. respectively. where n is the number of
genes and m is the number of disease phenotypes in the networks. The query
gene set is represented by a binary vector g: [g1,g2, ...,gn]T denoting the
gene membership against the gene set. i.e. each gi=1 if gene i is in the
query gene set. otherwise 0. Similarly. the list of target phenotype(s) is given
by another binary vector p:[p1,11n2,...,pm]T and phenotype j is a target
phenotype if pj :1. Our objective is to ﬁnd the p that gives the best rank
coherence with the query gene set g.

2.3 Computing graph Laplacian scores

To fully utilize network topological information. we compute the global
relevance score between the query gene set g and all the genes based on the
graph Laplacian of the gene network Gmxn). The laplacian scores exploit

modular information in a network to capture long range interactions between

1 1
the nodes in a graph. We ﬁrst normalize G as CzDEEGD;2 . where DG
is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements DGU = Zj GU. A vector g of
graph Laplacian scores is derived from the following optimization problem
(Zhou et al.. 2004).

_ 1—
mingZGu-(gi —gj>2+ Tags—g1)? (1)

U i

In Equation (1). the ﬁrst term is a smoothness penalty. which forces connected
genes to receive similar scores. and the second term ensures the consistency
with the query gene set. The Laplacian scores combine the neighboring
information in the network with the consistency with the query gene set to
provide a global relevance measure between each gene and the query gene
set. Parameter oz e(0,1) balances the contributions from the two penalties.
The closed-form solution of Equation (1) is

g=(1—a>(I—aG>‘1g. (2)

Empirically. to avoid computing the inverse of (I—otC). an iterative
algorithm can efﬁciently compute the closed-form solution with the
following update rule at each time step t.

g‘=(1—a>g+aGg‘—1. (3)

Similarly. graph Laplacian scores can be derived to measure the relevance
between the phenotypes and the target phenotypes p with optimization of

with the closed-form solution
ﬁ=(1—ﬁ>(I—5P>—1p. (5)

where P is the normalized P and ﬁe(0,l) is the balancing parameter.
Computing the Laplacian scores is equivalent to a weighted summation of
performing random walk on the graph from one step to inﬁnite step. Note
that G and P could also be normalized as a stochastic matrix. which is similar
to the normalized graph Laplacian G and P. Thus. G and P are allowed to
be directed graphs. One can use other scoring functions such as counting
the direct neighbors of the query gene set. or measuring the shortest path
from the query gene set to other genes as suggested in (Wu et al.. 2008).
However. empirically. the direct-neighbor function tends to generate very
sparse information. and the shortest path function does not fully explore the
neighborhood information.

2.4 Rank coherence in networks

The rcNet measures whether the query gene set g and a phenotype set
p show coherent associations with the known diseaseegene associations.
Speciﬁcally. given the graph Laplacian scores g, which rank the genes by
their relevance to the query gene set g. and the graph Laplacian scores 1").
which rank the disease phenotypes by their relevance to the hidden target
phenotypes p. Rank Coherence in Networks rcNet(g, f), A) measures whether
the associations given by A are connecting genes and phenotypes with
similar scores in g and 1"). We propose two different approaches to deﬁne
rcNets. The ﬁrst approach adopts a ridge regression model coupled with
label propagations to compute a closed-form solution of p. relaxed to real
numbers. The second approach uses simpler measures and enumerate all
possible p to ﬁnd the best ﬁtting for g.

2.4.] A ridge regression model Under the assumption that the Laplacian
score of a phenotype can be reconstructed by the linear combination of the
Laplacian scores of its gene neighbors in A. we can formulate the following
least-square cost function.

9=||AiJ—§||2- (6)

Eventually. we are interested in deriving p. After replacing g with Equation
(2) and p with Equation (5). we have the following regularization framework.
mp): | |(1—ﬁ)A(I—ﬁi’)‘lp —(1—oz)(I—aG)‘1g||2+Kllpl 12. (7)

where ||p||2 is a 2-norm regularizer and K is a small constant. Equation (7)
takes the standard form of ridge regression. and thus the closed-form solution
p* can be derived by

p* = (1 —ot)(ATA+KI)_1AT(I —otC)_1g, (8)
where A=(l—ﬁ)A(I—/3I’)_l. Note that the solution p* is a real vector.

which can be seen as an approximation of the binary vector p. A simple
post-processing is to select one or a few phenotypes that are assigned with
signiﬁcantly larger scores as the phenotypes associated with the gene set.
The full algorithm to solve the ridge regression model is given below.
dgsa_rcNet(g, C, P,A,ot, 18, (it)

1 p = 0

2 g = (1 — Ot)(1— (XG)_lg (equation (3))

3 A=(1_ 13)A(I— sin-1

4 p*=(ATA+KI)—1ATg

5 p(p* > (it) = 1 (target selection with threshold (it)

6 return (p)

The steps at line 2. 3 and 4 require cubic matrix inversion algorithms.
Thus. the time complexity of rcNet algorithm is 0(m3 +n3).

2.4.2 Enumeration methods The ridge regression model provides an
approximation solution. but if we are only interested in retrieving the most
relevant disease phenotype. We can simply go through each phenotype and
compute a score against the query gene set g for each case. Finally. the
phenotype with the largest score is chosen as the target phenotype. We
propose two functions to measure rcNet for this approach.

rcNetcoMgw 11A) = COHMIIE)w (9)

rcNet1.p(g.11A> = —ZAi,j(ri—gj>2. (10)
ii

Function rcNetcorr simply uses the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient to
check the consistency between A13 and g, similar to the concordance
score used by CIPHER (Wu et al.. 2008). Function rcNet]ap checks if the
neighboring genes and phenotypes in the association network are assigned
similar scores. and the smaller the disagreement. the higher the relevance.
The full algorithm to solve the two enumeration models is given below.

Inside the for-loop between line 3 and 7. the rcNet score is computed
for each conﬁguration of p. The overall time complexity of this algorithm
is also 0(m3+n3) if (1—13)(I—/3I’)_1 is precomputed. Note that this is
the computational cost by which we only want to retrieve one phenotype.
If we want to explore all possible conﬁgurations of p. the total cost is

exponential in m. This enumeration strategy is similar to CIPHER (Wu et al..
2008). The advantages are the conceptual simplicity and the optimality of the
exact solution. The disadvantages are the computational cost incurred by the
repeated calculation of the association score for each possible combination
of the individual phenotypes. and the inﬂexibility to extend to more general
problem of ﬁnding multiple target phenotypes.

3 RESULTS

The rcNet algorithms are compared to other methods with
leave-one-out cross-validation on Online Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (OMIM) associations and prediction of an independent
set of recently discovered disease-gene- associations. The
rcNet algorithms are then applied to validate ﬁndings in datasets
from Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), DNA copy number
analysis and microarray gene expression proﬁling.

3.1 Preparing networks

The disease phenotype network is an undirected graph with 5080
vertices representing OMIM disease phenotypes and edges with
weights in [0,1]. The edge weights measure the similarity between
two phenotypes by their overlap in the text and the clinical synopsis
in OMIM records, calculated by text mining (van Driel et al., 2006).

The disease—gene associations are represented by an undirected
bipartite graph with edges connecting phenotype nodes with their
causative gene nodes. Two versions (May-2007 Version and May-
2010 Version) of OMIM associations were used in the experiments.
May-2007 Version contains 1393 associations between 1126 disease
phenotypes and 916 genes, and May-2010 Version contains 2469
associations connecting 1786 disease phenotypes and 1636 genes.
May-2010 version was used in the experiments on the DNA copy
number and gene expression datasets. May-2007 version was used
in the experiments on the GWAS datasets since many of the
GWAS disease genes were already included in May-2010 Version.
Speciﬁcally, we selected the GWAS disease gene sets that do not
overlap with May-2007 Version as the test cases.

Two gene networks were used in the experiments. The ﬁrst
one was derived from the human protein—protein interaction (PPI)
network obtained from Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD)
(Peri et al., 2003). The PPI network contains 34 364 binary
undirected interactions between 8919 genes. This smaller network
was used in validations on the OMIM data due to the computation
limitation. A larger human ﬁmctional linkage network (Huttenhower
et al., 2009) was used in the experiments on the GWAS, DNA copy
number and gene expression datasets. This network contains 24 433
genes and ~60 million weighted edges. To reduce the computational
complexity, we applied a cutoff 0.6 on the edge weights to generate
a sparser network with ~7 million weighted edges.

3.2 Comparison with other methods

The rcNet algorithms were compared with CIPHER (Wu et al., 2008)
and Random Walk with Restart (label propagation) methods (Hwang
and Kuang, 2010; Kohler et al., 2008; Li and Patra, 2010; Vanunu
et al., 2010), since those methods reported the best performance
for disease gene prioritization. We adopted CIPHER with direct
neighbor (CDN) or shortest path (CSP) for disease phenotype and
gene set association analysis by averaging the correlations across
the genes in the query gene set. The Random Walk algorithm
described in Li and Patra (2010) (RWR) was chosen as the label

propagation method for comparison, because it is straightforward
to use the model for disease phenotype and gene set association
analysis. The two hyperparameters at and £3 for rcNet were chosen
from {0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7, 0.9}, and a ﬁxed small number K: 10—5 was
used for ridge regression in all experiments. The three balancing
parameters for RWR were also chosen from {0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9}.
For all the methods, a leave-one-out cross-validation on the OMIM
May-2007 Version was performed for parameter tuning, and then the
methods were applied to predict the associations in the independent
set of associations in OMIM May-2010 Version.

3.2.] Evaluation measures In all the experiments, a query gene
set was used to rank all the 5080 disease phenotypes. The higher
the target phenotype in the ranking, the better the performance. We
measured the performance by the area under the curve of receiver
operating characteristic (AUC). Since we are most interested in
whether the target phenotype is near the top, we report the AUC
up to the ﬁrst 50, 100 and 250 (top 5% phenotypes) false positives.
Speciﬁcally, we calculated the AUC in the part of ROC curve in the
range from 0 to 50, 100 or 250 false positives. Another important
evaluation is how well a method selects highly coherent top-ranked
genes and top-ranked phenotypes since high coherence implies a
good utilization of known associations. Speciﬁcally, the top genes
and phenotypes ranked by the query gene set and the target disease
phenotype contribute the largest penalties in the cost functions. Thus,
connections between them cancel out the large scores and result in
a smaller penalty. To quantify the connectivity, the top-r disease
genes and the top-l disease phenotypes with known OMIM disease—
gene associations are selected to measure fold enrichment, which

is calculated as $, where k is the number of observed OMIM

associations between the r genes and the 1 disease phenotypes, and
e is the probability of observing a random association between
a gene node and phenotype node, estimated from the density
of the OMIM disease phenotype—gene associations. Higher fold
enrichment indicates higher coherence between top-ranked genes
and disease phenotypes, i.e. highly connected with OMIM disease
phenotype—gene associations.

3.2.2 Leave-one-out cross-validation For each disease
phenotype, the genes associated with the phenotype in OMIM
were used as the query gene set to retrieve the disease phenotype.
Note that the associations between the query gene set and all
disease phenotypes including the target disease phenotype were
removed in the experiment for leave-one-out cross-validation. In
the experiments with RWR, as suggested by Li and Patra (2010), the
disease phenotype network was pruned by taking the ﬁve nearest
neighbors of each node to reduce the computational complexity in
leave-one-out cross-validation. The upper panel of Table 1 reports
the average AUC50, AUC100 and AUC250 across all the query
cases in the leave-one-out cross-validation. The detailed parameter
tuning results are reported in Supplementary Table S1. rcNetCOI-r
and rcNetlap achieved the best results with ~5% and 6% better
ranking compared with the best of the others (P < 1.31e—04 with
paired Wilcoxson test). rcNet performed similar with RWR, while
CIPHER DN and CIPHER SP achieved lower scores. Figure 2A
shows a global comparison of the ranking by plotting the number of
query cases with the target disease phenotype ranked above a certain
rank. rcNetcorr and rcNetlap generally achieved better rankings at
any ranking threshold in the experiments. For example, rcNetCOI-r

and rcNetlap ranked ~290 out of 1126 queries (26%) above rank

(20%) above that rank.

3.2.3 Ranking performance and association enrichment Figure 3
plots for each method the ranking performance versus fold
enrichment in OMIM associations. Based on the coherence
assumption, the top-ranked genes and the top-ranked phenotypes
by the query gene set and the target disease phenotype should
be highly connected with each other by a good method. In other

words, the higher the target-phenotype ranking the higher the fold
enrichment. The positive correlation is observed in all the methods.
Since CIPHER DN only relies on the direct neighbors in the ranking,
the association enrichment is not signiﬁcant for around 65% of the
query cases. CIPHER SP generated more signiﬁcant fold enrichment
scores. However, since CIPHER SP only utilized the shortest path
to rank the disease phenotypes, there is weak correlation between
its ranking performance and the fold enrichment in the lower
range [0,20]. The rcNet algorithms and RWR consistently generates
more cases with signiﬁcant fold enrichment and correlated ranking
performance than CIPHER DN/SP. To better quantify the relation
between ranking performance and fold enrichment, we also report
the number of target disease phenotypes ranked within top 100
with the corresponding fold enrichment score higher than 10 in
Supplementary Table S4. The rcNet algorithms identiﬁed more
such cases. The results support the rank coherence assumption
and suggest that label propagation is a better measure than direct
neighbors or shortest path to distinguish a target phenotype from
unrelated ones, because the information of gene and phenotype
neighborhoods are better utilized.

3.2.4 Predicting associations in test set With the best parameters
learned in leave-one-out cross-validation, all the methods were
applied to predict the target disease phenotype of the new disease
genes added into OMIM between May, 2007 and May, 2010. This
test set contains 387 disease phenotypes with new associations in
OMIM since May, 2007, excluding 11 new disease phenotypes
whose disease genes have no interaction in the gene network. In this
experiment, the task is to predict the target disease phenotype of the
newly annotated disease genes, i.e. to query a set of new disease
genes of a disease phenotype to retrieve the phenotype based on
the disease—gene associations in May-2007 Version. Table 1 reports
the average AUC50, AUC100 and AUC250. Figure 2B reports the
number of query cases with the target disease phenotype ranked
above a certain rank. The signiﬁcances of the pair-wise comparisons
between the methods are reported in Supplementary Table S3B.
rcNetcorr and rcNetlap performed the best, followed by rcNet and
RWR. CIPHER DN and SP did not produce comparable results with
the other methods. The results further support the better performance
of the rcNet algorithms compared with the other methods.

3.3 Robustness under bias and noise in networks

To test the robustness of the rcNet algorithms to bias and noise
in the networks, we repeated the experiments on perturbed gene
network and phenotype network. It is known that well-studied
disease proteins tend to have more interactions in the PPI network
and this degree bias could potentially lead to superior performance of
the network-based methods. An extended PPI network with the same
degree of interactions for each protein was generated to assess the
inﬂuence of the bias as suggested by Wu et al. (2008). The extended
PPI network was combined from HPRD, OPHID, BIND and MINT
database contain 72 431 undirected binary interactions between
14433 human proteins. The results are reported in Supplementary
Table S5. The rcNet algorithms consistently outperformed CIPHER
SP. With the replacement by the unbiased PPI network, rcNet
performed similarly as in the original experiment, while rcNetCOI-r,
rcNetlap and CIPHER SP performed worse. We also introduced
noise into the phenotype network to assess the robustness of

the methods to potentially inaccurate disease phenotype similarity
network as suggested by Wu et al. (2008). As the noise level in
the phenotype network increases, all the algorithms start to perform
worse (Fig. 4). The rcNet algorithms outperformed CIPHER SP at
all noise levels. Interestingly, while the performance of rcNetcorr,
rcNet1ap and CIPHER SP dropped sharply under the presence of
even relatively low noise, there is slower drop in the performance
of rcNet. These experiments on the extended PPI network and the
noise disease similarity networks suggest that rcNet is robust to bias
and noise in the networks compared with the other methods. Note
that since the perturbed gene network and phenotype network are
too dense to run RWR and CIPHER DN could not handle weighted
edges, RWR and CIPHER DN were not included in this analysis.

3.4 Predicting disease phenotypes of disease
susceptibility genes from GWAS

The goal of GWAS is to discover disease susceptibility loci/genes
that could be useful for assessing or predicting an individual’s risk of
disease. However, it is often challenging to assess how a set of novel
disease susceptibility genes potentially inﬂuence susceptibility in
disease, especially when the set of genes have no or little previously
known disease implications, or function and pathway annotations.
In this case study, we collected new disease susceptibility genes
from GWAS, whose roles in disease susceptibility are not previously
understood, and applied rcNet algorithms to predict the disease

phenotype of the disease susceptibility genes. We extracted all
the disease susceptibility genes discovered in GWAS based on a
recent survey of all studies reported in the GWAS catalog as of
December 2010 (Hindorff et al., 2009). After ﬁltering out the genes
already included in OMIM May-2007 Version, we selected 217
diseases/traits with novel susceptibility genes that are not associated
with any disease phenotype in OMIM May-2007 Version, and 31 of
the 217 diseases/traits could be matched with OMIM phenotypes in
the disease network. Subsequently, the 31 diseases/traits and their
susceptibility genes were used in this experiment.

We queried the set of disease susceptibility genes of each of the
31 diseases/traits to rank the 5080 OMIM disease phenotypes. The
ranking results of a subset of the 31 diseases/traits are reported
in Table 2. The full results are in Supplementary Table S6.
Among the 31 queries, 14 cases ranked the target diseases within
top 2% (ranked within top 100). Notable examples are prostate
cancer, breast cancer, basal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, systemic lupus erythematous and leprosy.
In these cases, the rcNet algorithms ranked the target disease
phenotype of the query gene set within top 1% (P <0.05). The
P-values were calculated by rerunning the algorithms on the
network with randomized OMIM associations 1000 times. Figure 5
shows the example that rcNet accurately ranked the breast cancer
phenotypes, by querying with 26 novel breast cancer susceptibility
genes from GWAS. One interesting observation is that the target
disease phenotype OMIM2113705 ‘BREAST CANCER 1 GENE;
BRCAl’ is only directly connected with three top-ranked disease
phenotypes, OMIM: 114480 ‘BREAST CANCER’, OMIM: 151623
‘LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1:LFS1’, and OMIM2‘259500:
OSTEOGENIC SARCOMA’, and only 5 of the 26 query genes
directly interact with the top-ranked disease genes. Direct neighbor
expansions in both the gene network and the phenotype network
resulted in four OMIM disease—gene associations. This observation
suggests that, simply exploring the direct neighbors of the query
gene set and the target disease phenotype in the networks, a method
might fail to infer disease—gene set associations, due to the low

statistical signiﬁcance of the sparse connectivity between the genes
and the disease phenotypes. Speciﬁcally, in this example, the fold
enrichment for four associations is 7.53, which is signiﬁcantly
<12.35 fold enrichment obtained by rcNet. Another interesting
example is the inference of the association between leprosy and
its susceptibility genes from GWAS (pubmed 20018961). In OMIM
May-2007 Version, leprosy has no causative genes, and the leprosy
susceptibility genes from GWAS also have no association with any
diseases. The lack of known associations in both the target disease
phenotype and the gene set poses ahard case that gene set enrichment
analysis based on overrepresentation will fail to reveal, but the
rcNet algorithms ranked leprosy within top 2%.

Interestingly, previous studies showed that disease susceptibility
genes from GWAS catalog have less modularities in the gene
network compared with the known disease genes in OMIM.
Furthermore, phenotypically similar diseases such as immunological
and gastrointestinal diseases do not tend to share their disease genes
(Baranzini, 2009; Barrenas et al., 2009). Those previous studies
also hypothesized that, due to the unique topological characteristics
of the disease susceptibility genes discovered in GWAS, the
existing network-based methods would fail to reveal the associations
between the disease susceptibility genes and the disease. However,
our experiments suggest that, by incorporating the global topological
information in the networks and the known OMIM associations, the
rcNet algorithms successﬁilly discovered the elusive associations in
many cases.

3.5 Predicting disease phenotypes of genes with copy
number changes or differential expression

We collected 13 human DNA copy number change datasets from
a recent human cancer copy number study from Beroukhim
et al. (2010). Genes in the detected copy number change regions
were used as the query gene set to predict their target disease
phenotypes. The target cancer phenotypes are ranked within top
2% for six cancers by rcNet and seven by rcNetCOI-r. In nine cases,
at least one algorithm ranked the target disease within top 100.

Beroukhim et al. (2010) concluded that more than three-quarters of
the statistically signiﬁcantly altered copy number regions contain
potential cancer-causing genes that are not previously validated
targets of cancer somatic copy number alternations. This suggests
that enrichment analysis of the genes will not reveal any disease
association, but the rcNet algorithms found many associations with
the network information. Similarly, we collected 13 human cancer
microarray gene expression dataset from GEO. The differentially
expressed genes were used to query for their target diseases. rcNet
ranked 7 within top 5%, and 12 within top 10%. Although the result
is only moderately encouraging, it validates the hypothesis that
the neighboring information of the differentially expressed genes
provides clue of association with the target disease phenotype. The
full results are reported in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8.

4 RELATED WORK

The rcNet algorithms are different from the gene set enrichment
analysis with statistical methods such as Hypergeometric statistics,
McNemar’s test, permutation test or other non-parametric methods
(Huang et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2004; Subramanian et al., 2005),
because the rcNet algorithms use the topological information in the
disease phenotype network and the gene network to analyze the
association between a gene set and all phenotypes simultaneously.
The simultaneous analysis of all phenotypes provides a global
dependence, and thus richer and more reliable information for
computing the association scores are used to rank the phenotypes.
The rcNet algorithms share more algorithmic similarity with the
disease gene prioritization methods, which were proposed for a
different purpose. CIPHER (Wu et al., 2008) scores each gene
against a disease phenotype based on the correlation between their
relevances with all the phenotypes, where the relevance between
the gene and a phenotype is calculated based on the distance
between the gene and the genes associated with the phenotype. The
methods proposed by Kohler et al. (2008), Vanunu et al. (2010)
and Linghu et al. (2009) applied random walk (label propagation)

or simpler neighborhood weighting to exploit the gene networks for
ranking genes for a disease phenotype, based on the seed genes
mapped from the disease phenotype. One limitation is that the
phenotype network and the sparse known associations are not fully
utilized in the global analysis. The label propagation algorithms
proposed by Hwang and Kuang (2010) and Li and Patra (2010)
explore a heterogeneous network combining the gene network, the
phenotype network and the associations to explore gene modules,
phenotype modules and the phenotype—gene association biclusters.
Since the two methods make ﬁill use of the information in the
networks, it is difﬁcult to interpret the results and to tune the best
parameters for combining the information.

5 DISCUSSION

Analysis of the gene sets from genome-wide high-throughput
screening is a continuing challenge in many disease studies.
Statistics from OMIM (January 2011) show that 3745 of the 6675
disease phenotypes are still unknown for their molecular basis.
Accordingly, enrichment analysis will fail to ﬁnd any associations
between the 3745 disease phenotypes and any query gene set.
rcNet is a helpful tool, with which researchers can validate their
ﬁndings from high-throughput studies, especially, to validate novel
associations between complex diseases and a query gene set with
no known associations. rcNet can also help identify closely related
phenotypes of the target disease of the query gene set. Since
rcNet algorithms utilize both the disease similarities and the gene
interactions, some phenotypically similar disease phenotypes will be
ranked at the top. These disease phenotypes might provide additional
information to investigate the target disease in the study.

Compared with the other methods that also utilize the gene
network and the disease network, rcNet is more ﬂexible in handling
the network data, because rcNet is capable of handling weighted
associations and weighted edges in denser gene network and disease
network. rcNet does not rely on deciding direct neighbors or shortest
path as CIHPER or PRINCE (Vanunu et al., 2010). rcNet also
does not suffer the converge problem as RWR does on a dense
large heterogeneous network. The ridge regression model coupled
with label propagation provides an approximation of jointly ﬁnding
association between a gene set and multiple disease phenotypes,
which is difﬁcult to achieve with enumeration-based strategies. The
network perturbation analysis validated that rcNet is robust under
the presence of network bias and noise, which explains that rcNet
outperformed the two variances, rcNetcorr and rcNetlap in the case
studies. A potential limitation of the current study is that it is difﬁcult
to distinguish the closely related phenotypes from false positives,
because it is possible that some of the top-ranked phenotypes are
not similar to or share any common disease genes with the target
disease phenotype in the disease network. Interpretation of these
phenotypes will not be straightforward. A possible solution is to
identify subnetworks and use information from the gene cluster and
the phenotype cluster for ﬁnding explanations.

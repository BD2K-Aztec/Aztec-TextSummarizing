Abstract

Summary: We report the creation of Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB), a new gene set resource
that relates drugs/compounds and their target genes, for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).
DSigDB currently holds 22 527 gene sets, consists of 17389 unique compounds covering 19531
genes. We also developed an online DSigDB resource that allows users to search, view and down—
load drugs/compounds and gene sets. DSigDB gene sets provide seamless integration to GSEA
software for linking gene expressions with drugs/compounds for drug repurposing and transla—

tional research.

Availability and implementation: DSigDB is freely available for non—commercial use at http://tan

lab.ucdenver.edu/DSigDB.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

1 Introduction

High—throughput genomic technologies enable researchers to ana—
lyze tens of thousands of ‘omic’ data points within biological sys—
tems. Typically, long lists of interesting candidate genes were
generated from these analyses. However, interpreting these gene lists
remains a challenge for biomedical researchers. Recognizing that
genes act in concert to drive various biological processes, Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was introduced to summarize gen—
omics data using a priori defined gene sets (Mootha et (11., 2003,
Subramaniam et (11., 2005). This seminal article has revolutionized
genomic data analyses and interpretation, inﬂuenced the develop—
ment of other analytical enrichment tools. The critical components
of these tools are the ‘annotated databases’ used as the gene sets for
summarizing high—level biological processes. The popular Molecular
Signatures Database (Liberzon et (11., 2011), which provides the
gene sets for GSEA, currently contains positional, curated, Gene
Ontology, motif and computational gene sets. It also contains

specialized gene sets for oncogenic and immunologic signatures that
were extracted from literatures. GeneSigDB (Culhane et (11., 2009), a
database of gene signatures extracted and manually curated from
the published literature, is another resource for analytical enrich—
ment tools.

Here, we introduce Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB), a col—
lection of drug and small molecule—related gene sets based on quanti—
tative inhibition and/or drug—induced gene expression changes data
(see Supplementary Fig. S1). DSigDB differs from the existing
resources in the following aspects: (i) DSigDB gene sets were
extracted and compiled from quantitative inhibition data of drugs/
compounds from a variety of databases and publications. These
genes represent the direct targets of the drugs/compounds. (ii)
DSigDB gene sets are acquired through both automatic computa—
tional methods and manual curation. (iii) Gene sets from DSigDB
are explicitly designed to provide seamless integration to GSEA
software (see Supplementary Fig. S2). (iv) DSigDB contains the

largest number of drugs/compound—related gene sets to date. Here,
we will describe the gene set collections of DSigDB, the accompany—
ing online resource, and provide an example illustrating the utility
of DSigDB gene sets for GSEA software.

2 DSigDB Collections
2.1 DSigDB collections

DSigDB organizes drugs and small molecules—related gene sets into
four collections based on quantitative inhibition and/or drug—
induced gene expression changes data.

2.2 D1: approved drugs

This collection of gene sets contains 1202 Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved drugs covering 1288 target genes.
We obtained all the approved drugs from US FDA website, and
retrieved bioactivity data for these drugs from PubChem and
ChEMBL. Genes with ‘active’ bioassay results recorded in these
databases were compiled as the drug target genes (see
Supplementary Data for details). The mean gene set size for D1 is 10
(range 1—258).

2.3 D2: kinase inhibitors

The human kinome has been a class of intensely pursued drug tar—
gets by the pharmaceutical industry. Kinases are frequently mutated
in various cancers. Therefore targeting these kinases with small mol—
ecules is an attractive therapeutic approach for personalized cancer
treatment. This collection of gene sets contains 1220 kinase inhibi—
tors (1065 unique kinase inhibitors) covering 407 kinases. We col—
lected large—scale in vitro kinase profiling assays from literature and
two databases (Medical Research Council Kinase Inhibitor database
and Harvard Medical School Library of Integrated Network—based
Cellular Signatures database). We considered the kinase a target of a
kinase inhibitor if the IC50/Kd/Ki g 1 (AM or the Percent of inhibition
over Control 3 15% from the assays. These target kinases make up
the gene sets for the kinase inhibitors. The mean gene set size for D2
is 15 (range 1—315).

2.4 D3: perturbagen signatures

This collection of gene sets was obtained from gene expression pro—
files induced by compounds. We collected 7064 gene expression
profiles from three cancer cell lines perturbed by 1309 compounds
from CMap (build 02) (Lamb et al., 2006). For each compound, we
compared the treated versus control gene expression profiles for
each cell line. Genes with >2—fold change from the control were con—
sidered as gene sets (either up or down) for that compound. We
defined 1998 gene sets (1154 unique compounds) covering 11 137
genes in this collection. The mean gene set size for D3 is 81 (range
1—3468).

2.5 D4: computational drug signatures

We compiled 18 107 drug signatures extracted from literatures using
a mixture of manual curation and text mining approaches. Using
manual curation of targets, we compiled 10 830 and 5163 gene sets
from the Therapeutics Targets Database (Qin et al., 2014) and the
Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (Davis et al., 2013), re—
spectively. For the text mining approach, we used the Biomedical
Object Search System (Choi et al., 2012) to acquire 2114 co—occur—
rences of compounds and genes from PubMed abstracts. In addition,
we also retrieved genes with ‘active’ bioactivity data for these drugs
from PubChem and ChEMBL as in D1. These genes, with

quantitative inhibition data, were integrated with the drug signa—
tures obtained from the source to construct the final gene sets for
the drug (see Supplementary Data for details). The mean gene set
size for D4 is 28 (range 1—8312).

2.6 Gene set annotations

Each DSigDB gene set consists of a list of target genes of a com—
pound. The current version of DSigDB focuses on human gene sets.
We used human Entrez Gene IDs to serve as universal identifiers to
map across different databases. We used InChiKey to serve as the
universal compound identifiers to map between PubChem and
ChEMBL, and to determine the number of unique compounds
within DSigDB. As described in the DSigDB collections, these gene
sets are collected from several sources and some compounds could
appeared multiple times according to their source of collection.
DSigDB currently holds 22 527 gene sets, consists of 17 389 unique
compounds covering 19 5 31 genes. Statistics for the gene set size is
available in Supplementary Materials.

2.7 File formats

DSigDB gene sets are available to download as GSEA gene set
(.gmt), plain text (.txt) or detailed text (_detailed.txt) formats. The
.gmt file format can be directly imported into GSEA to execute the
program. The gene set results generated from GSEA provide links to
the DSigDB online resource for detailed information about the com—
pounds. The plain text format provides a simple list of gene set
membership for the compound. The detailed text format provides
detailed information of the relations between genes and drug. It con—
tains four columns: Drug, Gene, Type and Source. Every line repre—
sents the relation between drug and gene, the type of interactions
(either quantitative binding results or qualitative interactions), and
the source of the relation (See USER MANUAL for details). We also
provide these files (either .gmt, .txt or detailed.txt) for the whole
database as downloadable in the Download Page.

3 DSigDB online resource

As a companion to the DSigDB gene sets, we developed an online re—
source to allow users to search, view and download the compound
information and annotated gene sets.

Each gene set and all of its annotations are presented as an indi—
vidual web page (Fig. 1). Each web page contains four parts: (i) top
part describes the clinical development of the compound (approved
or clinical trials); (ii) middle part indicates the molecular details of
the compound including chemical structure (2D and 3D), links to
PubChem or ChEMBL; (iii) bottom part lists the gene memberships
with embedded links to the source of evidence; (iv) download
gene set.

The web resource provides support for two search functions: i)
compound search and ii) gene search. For ‘compound search’ func—
tion, the query compound will return the molecule information of
the compound, its gene memberships with links to external sources
(Fig. 1). For the ‘gene search’ function, it will return the list of com—
pounds that target the query gene. Both search functions will pro—
vide the user to navigate the interactions between drug—gene in
DSigDB. All DSigDB data are freely available for download.

4 Use case example

To illustrate an application of DSigDB, we performed GSEA on a pre—
viously published non—small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) microarray

gene expression data (Coldren et al., 2006) using the D2 gene sets.
We selected nine gefitinib (first—generation EGFR inhibitor)—sensitive
(IC503 2uM) and nine resistant (IC50 > 4uM) EGFR wild—type
NSCLC lines for the analysis. Raw microarray gene expression data
for these 18 cell lines were normalized, and gene expression profiles
were extracted and served as the input for GSEA. GSEA was con—
ducted by comparing gefitinib sensitive versus resistant lines using all
of the D2 gene sets. We performed 1000 gene set permutations, and
considered gene sets with P < 0.05 as significant. From the results, we
observed 16 and 7 gene sets were enriched in the sensitive and resist—
ant groups (P < 0.05), respectively. Notably, the top two gene sets of
the sensitive group are CI—1033 and AZD9291, which are newer gen—
eration of EGFR inhibitors currently being tested in the clinic for
NSCLC patients. According to the kinase inhibition profiles, 15 of the
16 gene sets enriched in the sensitive group inhibited EGFR.
Conversely, none of the compounds enriched in the resistant group in—
hibit EGFR. This is expected as the comparison is between EGFR in—
hibitor sensitive versus resistant group. Interestingly, RO—3306, a
CDK1 inhibitor was identified as enriched in resistant group. From
the GDSC website (Yang et al., 2013), two of the gefitinib—resistant
lines have lower IC50 as compared with the four gefitinib—sensitive
lines, supporting the GSEA results and suggesting that this compound
may be useful for EGFR inhibitor resistant lines (see Supplementary
Data for details).

5 General applications of DSigDB

More generally, the DSigDB gene sets could be used with other en—
richment tools for data analysis. For example, if a user has obtained
a list of significant genes from a particular experiment, these genes
could be tested for drug—target enrichment or over—representation
analysis using the DSigDB gene sets. This will provide a list of candi—
date drugs/compounds enriched in the gene list for follow—up
experiments.

Another application of DSigDB gene sets is to construct drug—
target interactions networks for other bioinformatics analyses and
discoveries. The gene sets could be easily added in as plug—in mod—
ules for visualizing the interactions between chemical—biological net—
works. This highlights the general usefulness of the DSigDB data in
other bioinformatics analyses.

6 Conclusions

In conclusion, we developed DSigDB, a novel collection of gene sets
based on quantitative inhibition and/or drug—induced gene expres—
sion changes data of drugs and compounds, as a resource for various
gene set enrichment tools. We implemented an online resource to
allow users to search, view and download the DSigDB gene sets. We
believe that DSigDB represents a significant improvement in drugs/
compounds related gene sets by quantity and quality (standardized
formats for both genes and compounds). Users could seamlessly in—
tegrate DSigDB in their gene set enrichment analyses to provide dir—
ect links from gene lists to drugs for translational research and drug
repurposing studies.

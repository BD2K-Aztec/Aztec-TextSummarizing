Abstract

Motivation: A crucial problem in genome assembly is the discovery and correction of misassembly
errors in draft genomes. We develop a method called MISSEOUEL that enhances the quality of draft
genomes by identifying misassembly errors and their breakpoints using paired—end sequence
reads and optical mapping data. Our method also fulfills the critical need for open source computa—
tional methods for analyzing optical mapping data. We apply our method to various assemblies of
the loblolly pine, Francisella tularensis, rice and budgerigar genomes. We generated and used
stimulated optical mapping data for loblolly pine and Ftularensis and used real optical mapping
data for rice and budgerigar.

Results: Our results demonstrate that we detect more than 54% of extensively misassembled con—
tigs and more than 60% of locally misassembled contigs in assemblies of F.tularensis and between
31% and 100% of extensively misassembled contigs and between 57% and 73% of locally misas—
sembled contigs in assemblies of loblolly pine. Using the real optical mapping data, we correctly
identified 75% of extensively misassembled contigs and 100% of locally misassembled contigs in
rice, and 77% of extensively misassembled contigs and 80% of locally misassembled contigs in
budgerigar.

Availability and implementation: MISSEOUEL can be used as a post—processing step in combination

 

with any genome assembler and is freely available at http://www.cs.co|ostate.edu/seq/.

1 Introduction

Comparing genetic variation between and within a species is a fun-
damental activity in biological research. For example, there is cur-
rently a major effort to sequence entire genomes of agriculturally
important plant species to identify parts of the genome variable in
a given breeding program and; ultimately, create superior plant
varieties. Robust genome assembly methods are imperative to these
large sequencing initiatives and other scientific projects (Haussler
et al. 2008; Ossowski et al. 2008; Robinson et al. 2011;
Turnbaugh et a]. 2007) because scientific analyses frequently use
those genomes to determine genetic variation and associated biolo-
gical traits.

At present; the majority of assembly programs are based on the
Eulerian assembly paradigm (Idury and Waterman 1995; Pevzner
et al. 2001); where a de Bruijn graph is constructed with a vertex z/

for every (k 7 l)-mer present in a set of reads and an edge (12.12’) for
every observed k-mer in the reads with (k 7 l)-mer prefix 12 and
(k 7 l)-mer suffix 12’. A contig corresponds to a non-branching path
through this graph. We refer the reader to Compeau et a]. (2011) for
a more thorough explanation of de Bruijn graphs and their use in as-
sembly. SPAdes (Bankevich et a1. 2012); IDBA (Peng et al. 2012);
Euler-SR (Chaisson and Pevzner 2008); Velvet (Zerbino and Birney
2008); SOAPdenovo (Li et al. 2010); ABySS (Simpson et al. 2009)
and ALLPATHS (Butler et a1. 2008) all use this paradigm and follow
the same general outline: extract k-mers from the reads; construct a
de Bruijn graph from the set k-mers; simplify the graph and con-
struct contigs.

One crucial problem that persists in Eulerian assembly (and
genome assembly; in general) is the discovery and correction of mis-
assembly errors in draft genomes. We define a Misassembly error as

Misassembly detection using paired—end sequence reads and optical mapping data i81

 

an assembled region that contains a significantly large insertion, de—
letion, inversion, or rearrangement that is the result of decisions
made by the assembly program. Identification of misassembly errors
is important because true biological variations manifest in similar
ways, and thus, these errors can be easily misconstrued as true gen—
etic variation (Salzberg 2005). This can mislead a range of genomic
analyses. We note that the exact definition of a misassembly error
can vary and adopt the standard definition used by QUAST
(Gurevich et al. 2013) and other tools. See Section 3.1 for this exact
definition. Once the existence and location of a misassembly are
identified, it can be removed by segmenting the contig at that
location.

We present a computational method for identifying misassembly
errors using a combination of short reads and optical mapping data.
Optical mapping is a system developed in 1993 (Schwartz et al.
1993) that can construct ordered, genome—wide, high—resolution re—
striction maps. The system works as follows (Aston and Schwartz
2006; Dimalanta et al. 2004): an ensemble of DNA molecules
adhered to a charged glass plate is elongated by fluid flow. An en—
zyme is then used to cleave them into fragments at loci where the
corresponding recognition sequence occurs. Next, the fragments are
highlighted with fluorescent dye and imaged under a microscope.
Finally, these images are analyzed to estimate the fragment sizes,
producing a molecular map. Since the fragments stay relatively sta—
tionary during the aforementioned process, the images capture their
relative order and size (Neely et al. 2011). Multiple copies of the
genome undergo this process, and a consensus map is formed that
consists of an ordered sequence of fragment sizes, each indicating
the approximate number of bases between occurrences of the recog—
nition sequence in the genome (Anantharaman and Mishra 2001).

Although optical mapping data have been used for discerning
structural variation in the human genome (Teague et al. 2010) and
for scaffolding and validating contigs for several large sequencing
projects—including those for various prokaryote species (Reslewic
et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2002, 2004), rice (Zhou et al. 2007), maize
(Zhou et al. 2009), mouse (Church et al. 2009), goat (Dong et al.
2013), parrot (Howard et al. 2014) and Amborella tric/aopoa'a
(Chamala et al. 2013)—there are no publicly available tools for
using this data for misassembly detection using short read and op—
tical mapping data. In 2014, Mendelowitz and Pop (2014) further
this point stating that ‘There is, thus, a critical need for the contin—
ued development and public release of software tools for processing
optical mapping data, mirroring the tremendous advances made in
analytical methods for second— and third—generation sequencing
data’.

Our tool, which we call sc>/sc>, predicts which contigs are
misassembled and the approximate locations of the errors in the
contigs. It takes as input the paired—end sequence read data, con—
tigs, an ensemble of optical maps and the restriction enzymes used
to construct the optical maps. MISSEQUEL first uses the paired—end
read data to divide the contigs into two sets: those that are pre—
dicted to be correctly assembled and those that are not. Then the
set of contigs that are candidates for containing misassembly
errors are further divided into misassembled contigs and correctly
assembled contigs using optical mapping data. Fundamental to
the first step is the concept of a red—black positional a'e Brui/n
graph, which encapsulates recurring artifacts in the alignment
of the sequence read data to the contigs and their position in the
contig. The red vertices in this graph indicate if a contig is likely
to be misassembled and also flag the location where the misassem—
bly error occurs. These locations are called misassembly
breakpoints.

In the second stage of MISSEQUEL where optical mapping data
are used, the contigs conjectured to be misassembled are in silico di—
gested with the set of input restriction enzymes and aligned to the
optical map using Twin (Mugin et al. 2014). Based on the presence
or absence of alignment, a prediction of misassembly is made. The
in silico digestion process computationally mimics how each restric—
tion enzyme would cleave the segment of DNA defined by the con—
tig, returning ‘mini—optical maps” that can be aligned to the optical
map for the whole genome. An important aspect of our work is that
it highlights the need to use another source of information, which is
independent of the sequence data but representative of the same gen—
ome, to identify misassembly errors. We show that optical mapping
data can be used as this information source.

We give results for the Francisella tularensis, loblolly pine, rice
and budgerigar genomes. Each genome was assembled using various
de Bruijn graph assemblers, and then misassembly errors were pre—
dicted. We present results for both real and simulated optical map—
ping data; simulated data were generated for the Etularensis and
loblolly pine genomes, and real optical mapping data for the rice
and budgerigar genomes. Our results on Etularensis show that
MISSEQUEL correctly identifies (on average) 86% and 80% of locally
and extensively misassembled contigs, respectively. This is a consid—
erable improvement on existing methods, which identified (on aver—
age) 26% and 16% of locally and extensively misassembled contigs,
respectively, in the same assemblies. The results on the loblolly pine
genome assemblies show similar improvement. Out of the 499 ex—
tensively and 3 locally misassembled contigs in the SOAPdenovo as—
sembly of rice, MISSEQUEL correctly identified 374 (75 %) and 3
(100%) of them, respectively. Competing methods identified be—
tween 25% and 30% of these extensively misassembled contigs, and
none of these locally misassembled contigs. Lastly, we downloaded
the latest Illumina—454 hybrid assembly of budgerigar that was
released by Ganapathy et al. (2014), and predicted misassembly
errors using the accompanied Illumina paired—end data and optical
mapping data. MISSEQUEL correctly identified 10 777 of the 13 996
extensively misassembled contigs (77%) and 2350 (out of 2937)
locally misassembled contigs (80%). Hence, we tested our method
across four different genomes, which all vary in size and GC
content.

Our conclusions, based on these experimental results, are that
the specificity of MISSEQUEL significantly increases by incorporating
optical mapping data into the prediction of misassembly errors, and
the sensitivity of MISSEQUEL is substantially better in comparison to
competing methods that just use paired—end data. Therefore, we
show evidence that optical mapping data can be a powerful tool for
misassembly identification.

1.1 Related work

Amosvalidate (Phillippy et al. 2008), REAPR (Hunt et al. 2013) and
Pilon (Walker et al. 2014) are capable of identifying and correcting
misassembly errors. REAPR is designed to use both short insert and
long insert paired—end sequencing libraries; however, it can operate
with only one of these types of sequencing data. Amosvalidate,
which is included as part of the AMOS assembly package (Treangen
et al. 2011), was developed specifically for first generation sequenc—
ing libraries (Phillippy et al. 2008). iMetAMOS (Koren et al. 2014)
is an automated assembly pipeline that provides error correction
and validation of the assembly. It packages several open—source tools
and provides annotated assemblies that result from an ensemble of
tools and assemblers. Currently, it uses REAPR for misassembly
error correction. Pilon (Walker et al. 2014) detects a variety (includ—
ing misassembly) of errors in draft genomes and variant detection.

Similar to REAPR; Pilon is specifically designed to use short insert
and long insert libraries but unlike REAPR and amosvalidate; it is
specifically designed for microbial genomes.

Many optical mapping tools exist and deserve mentioning;
including AGORA (Lin et al. 2012); SOMA (Nagarajan et al.
2008) and Twin (Muggli et al. 2014). AGORA (Lin et al. 2012)
uses the optical map information to constrain de Bruijn graph con-
struction with the aim of improving the resulting assembly. SOMA
(Nagarajan et al. 2008) uses dynamic programming to align iii sil-
ico-digested contigs to an optical map. Twin (Muggli et al. 2014)
is an index-based method for aligning contigs to an optical map.
Because of its use of an index data structure; it is capable of align-
ing in silico-digested contigs orders of magnitude faster than com-
peting methods. Xavier et al. (2014) demonstrated misassembly
errors in bacterial genomes can be detected using proprietary
software.

Lastly; there are special purpose tools that have some relation
to MISSEQUEL in their algorithmic approach. Numerous assembly
tools use a finishing process after assembly; including Hapsembler
(Donmez and Brudno 2011); LOCAS (Klein et al. 2011);
Meraculous (Chapman et al. 2011) and the ‘assisted assembly’ al-
gorithm (Gnerre et al. 2009). Hapsembler (Donmez and Brudno
2011) is a haplotype-specific genome assembly toolkit that is de-
signed for genomes that are highly polymorphic. RACA (Kim et al.
2013) and SCARPA (Donmez and Brudno 2013) are two scaffold-
ing algorithms that perform paired-end alignment to the contigs as
an initial step and; thus; are similar to our algorithm in that
respect.

2 Methods

MISSEQUEL can be broken down into four main steps: recruitment of
reads to contigs; construction of the red—black positional de Bruijn
graph; misassembly error prediction and misassembly verification
using optical mapping data. We explain each of these steps in detail
in the following subsections.

2.1 Recruitment of reads and threshold calculation

MISSEQUEL first aligns reads to contigs to identify regions that con-
tain abnormal read alignments. Collapsed or expanded repeats will
present as the read coverage being greater or lower than the ex-
pected genome coverage in the region that has been misassembled.
Similarly; inversion and rearrangement errors will present as the
alignment of the mate-pairs being rearranged. Figure 1 illustrates

these concordant and discordant read alignments. More specific-
ally; this step consists of aligning all the (paired-end) reads to all
the contigs and then calculating three thresholds; AL; AU and F.
The range [AL.AU] defines the acceptable read depth; and F defines
the maximum allowable number of reads whose mate-pair aligns
in an inverted orientation. To calculate these thresholds; we
consider all alignments of each read as opposed to just the best
alignment of each read since misassembly errors frequently
occur within repetitive regions where the reads will align to mul-
tiple locations. MISSEQUEL performs this step using BWA (version
0.5.9) in paired-end mode with default parameters (Li and Durbin
2009). Subsequently; after alignment; each contig is treated as a
series of consecutive ZOO-bp regions. These are sampled uniformly
at random (5 times; and the mean (pd) and the standard
deviation (0d) of the read depth and the mean (11,) and the standard
deviation (0,) of the number of alignments where a discordant
mate-pair orientation is witnessed are calculated from these
sampled regions. AL is set to the maximum of {041,1 7 30,1}; AU is
set to M 7 30d and F is set to ,u, 7 3a,. The default for l? is ﬁth of
the contig length; and this parameter can be changed in the input
to MISSEQUEL.

2.2 Construction ofthe red—black positional de Bruijn
graph

After threshold calculation; the red—black positional de Bruijn graph
is constructed. For clarity; we begin by describing the positional dc
Bruijn graph; given by Ronen et al. (2012) and then define the red—
black positional de Bruijn graph. Although the edges in the
traditional de Bruijn graph correspond to k-mers; the edges in the
positional de Bruijn graph correspond to k-mers and their inferred
positions on the contigs (positional k-mers). Hence; the positional
de Bruijn graph GM) is defined for a multiset of positional k-mers
and parameter (I) and is constructed in a similar manner to the trad-
itional de Bruijn graph using an A-Bruijn graph framework
from (Pevzner et al. 2004). Given a k-mer 5),; let prefix(sk) be the
first k 7 1 nucleotides of 5),; and suffix(sk) be the last k 7 l nucleo-
tides of 5);. Each positional k-mer (sky?) in the input multiset corres-
ponds to a directed edge in the graph between two positional
(k 7 l)-mers; (prefix(s)\,).p) and (suffix(sk).p 71). After all edges
are formed; the graph undergoes a gluing operation. A pair of pos-

’.p’); are glued together into

itional (k 7 l)-mers; (5), 1.1)) and (5), 1
a single vertex if 5), 1 :5), 1’ and p E [p’7(I).p’7(I)j. Two pos-
itional (k 7 l)-mers are glued together if their sequences are the

same and their positions are within (I) from each other. We refer to

maps. The alignment is performed using Twin (Muggli et al. 2014)
(with default parameters) and then these results are filtered accord—
ing to the x2 model mentioned above. For our experiments, optical
maps were simulated by in silico digesting reference genomes, add—
ing normally distributed noise with a 150 bp standard deviation
and discarding fragments smaller than 700 bp.

3 Analyses

3.1 Datasets using simulated optical mapping data

Our first dataset consisted of approximately 6.9 million paired—
end 101 bp reads from the prokaryote genome Ftularensis,
generated by Illumina Genome Analyzer (GA) IIx platform. It was
obtained from the NCBI Short Read Archive [accession
number (SRA:SRR063416)]. The reference genome was
also downloaded from the NCBI website [Reference genome
(RefSeq:NC_006570.2)]. The Ftularensis genome is 1 892775 bp
in length with a GC content of 32%. As a measure of quality assur—
ance, we aligned the reads to the Ftularensis genome using BWA
(version 0.5.9) (Li and Durbin 2009) with default parameters. We
call a read mapped if BWA outputs an alignment for it and
unmappea' otherwise. Analysis of the alignments revealed that
97% of the reads mapped to the reference genome representing an
average depth of approximately 367><.

Our second dataset consisted of approximately 31.3 million
paired—end 100 bp reads from the loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)
genome (Neale et al. 2014), which has GC contact of 38%. We
downloaded the reference genome from the pine genome website
(http://pinegenome.org/pinerefseq) and simulated reads from the
largest five hundred scaffolds from the reference using ART (Huang
et al. 2012) (‘art illumina’). ART was ran with parameters that
simulated 100 bp paired end reads with 200 bp insert size and 50x
coverage. The data for this experiment are available on the
MISSEQUEL website. We simulated an optical map using the reference
genome for Etularensis and loblolly pine since there is no publicly
available one for these genomes.

We assembled both sets of reads with a wide variety of state—of—
the—art assemblers. The versions used were those that were publicly
available before or on September 1, 2014: SPAdes (version 3.1)
(Bankevich et al. 2012); Velvet (version 1.2.10) (Zerbino and Birney
2008); SOAPdenovo (version 2.04) (Li et al. 2010); ABySS (version
1.5.2) (Simpson et al. 2009) and IDBA—UD (version 1.1.1) (Peng
et al. 2012). SPAdes outputs two assemblies: before repeat reso—
lution and after repeat resolution—we report both. Some of the

assemblers emitted both contigs and scaffolds. We considered con—
tigs only but note that all scaffolds had a greater number of misas—
sembly errors. We emphasize that our purpose here is not to
compare the various assemblers, but instead it is to demonstrate that
all assemblers produce misassembly errors, which are in need of con—
sideration and correction.

We used QUAST (Gurevich et al. 2013) in default mode to
evaluate the assemblies. Hence, our experiments use the published
reference genomes as being ground truth and use the published ref—
erences to identify misassembly errors in the other assemblies
through QUAST. We note that this is imperfect since the reference
genomes are likely not error—free. QUAST defines misassembly
error as being extensive or local. An extensively misassembled con—
tig is defined as one that satisfies one following conditions: (i) the
left flanking sequence aligns over 1 kb away from the right flank—
ing sequence on the reference; (ii) flanking sequences overlap on
more than 1 kb and (iii) flanking sequences align to different
strands or different chromosomes, whereas a local misassembled
contig is one that satisfies the following conditions: (i) two or more
distinct alignments cover the breakpoint; (ii) the gap between left
and right flanking sequences is less than 1 kb and the left and right
flanking sequences both are on the same strand of the same
chromosome of the reference genome. We made a minor alteration
to QUAST to output which contigs contain local misassembly
errors. A contig can contain both extensive and local misassembly
errors. Any correctly assembled contig is one that does not contain
either type of error.

3.1.1 Detection of misassembly errors in F.tularensis

Table 1 gives the assembly statistics corresponding to this experi—
ment. Comparable assembly results on this data were reported by
Ilie et al. (2014), though in some cases we used more recent software
releases (e.g. for SPAdes). Note that the number of locally misas—
sembled contigs and the number of extensively misassembled contigs
is not disjoint. A contig can be locally and extensively misassembled.
Thus, Table 1 gives the number of contigs having at least one exten—
sive misassembly error and the number of contigs having at least one
local misassembly error.

Table 2 shows the results for (i) MISSEQUEL with paired—end data
only; (ii) MISSEQUEL with optical mapping data only and (iii)
MISSEQUEL with both optical mapping and paired—end data to dem—
onstrate the benefit of combining both types of data. As demon—
strated by these results, using short paired—end data alone produced
a high false—positive rate (FPR) due to ambiguous read mapping in

The TPR in this context is a contig that is misassembled and is predicted to be so. The FPR is a correctly assembled contig that was predicted to be misas—

sembled. The TPR and FPR are given as percentages with the raw values given in brackets. Bold values emphasize the beneﬁt of using both data sources.

locations that contain repetitive regions. This is an inherent short—
coming of short paired—end data and demonstrates that to decrease
the FPR, another source of information must be used in combin—
ation. Optical mapping data have a much lower FPR and when used
in combination with paired—end data, produces optimal results. The
lowest FPR was witnessed when both optical mapping and paired—
end data were used. In some cases, the reduction in the FPR was
dramatic: from 87% (ABySS, paired—end data) to 13% (ABySS,
paired—end and optical mapping data). The true—positive rate (TPR)
of locally misassembled contigs was between 77% and 100% when
both paired—end and optical mapping data were used. Lastly, TPR of
extensively misassembled contigs was between 55% and 100%
when both paired—end and optical mapping data were used.

In our experiments, we iterate through combinations of three
enzymes from the REBASE enzyme database (Roberts et al. 2010)
and use the set of enzymes that performed best. Our results

demonstrate that with a good enzyme choice over half of all exten—
sively misassembled contigs and over 75% of locally misassembled
contigs can be identified with only a 9—22% false discovery rate.

3.1.2 Detection of misassembly errors in loblolly pine

Table 3 gives the assembly statistics corresponding to this experi—
ment. The results for the loblolly pine are listed in Table 4. Both
Velvet and SOAPdenovo produced zero misassembled contigs on
this dataset, so we do not include them in Table 4. MISSEQUEL cor—
rectly identifies between 31% and 100% of extensively misas—
sembled contigs and between 57% and 73% of locally
misassembled contigs. The FPR was between 0.6% and 43%.
Although REAPR has a lower FPR (between 3% and 11%), it is
only capable of identifying a small number of extensively misas—
sembled contigs (between 2% and 14%) and a small number of lo—
cally misassembled contigs (between 2% and 27%). Similar to the

Again, a true positive in this context is a contig that is misassembled and is predicted to be so. A false positive is a correctly assembled contig that was predicted

to be misassembled. Bold values highlight MISSEQUEL results.

results of Etularensis, Pilon had a lower FPR but also lower TPRs
than REAPR. This is unsurprising since ‘it is optimized to use both
fragment (or small) and long (or large) insert libraries” and was cre—
ated for microbial genomes (Walker et al. 2014).

Again, the restriction enzymes used in our experiments were
chosen to be optimal by considering the set of all possible enzymes
in the aforementioned database. Nonetheless, we note that if the en—
zyme combination was chosen at random, then the expected FPR
and TPR would decrease by a small fraction for majority of the
assemblies considered. The Supplementary Material shows proto—
typical ROC curves and heat—maps illustrating the density of enzyme
combinations at various detection rates.

3.2 Datasets using real optical mapping data

We evaluated the performance of MISSEQUEL on rice and budgerigar.
These genomes were chosen because they have available sequence and
optical mapping data, are diverse in size and have undergone a signifi—
cant level of verification. Rice and budgerigar have genome sizes of
430 Mb and 1.58 Gbp, respectively (Kawahara et al. 2013; Tiersch
and Wachtel 1991). The size of budgerigar is only predicted (Tiersch
and Wachtel 1991). The validated genomic regions will allow us to
use QUAST to determine FPR and TPR, as in Subsection 3.1.

3.2.1 Performance on rice genome
The sequence dataset consists of approximately 134 million 76—bp
paired—end reads for rice from the japonica cultivar Nipponbare,
generated by Illumina, Inc. on the Genome Analyzer (GA) IIx plat—
form (Kawahara et al. 2013). These reads were obtained from the
NCBI Short Read Archive (accession SRX032913). The optical map
for this same cultivar of rice was constructed by Zhou et al. (2007)
using SwaI as the restriction enzyme. This optical map was
assembled from single molecule restriction maps into 14 optical
map contigs, labeled as 12 chromosomes, with chromosome labels 6
and 11 both containing two optical map contigs. Both the sequence
and optical mapping data were generated as part of a larger project
that produced a ‘revised, error—corrected, and validated assembly of
the Nipponbare cultivar of rice’ (Kawahara et al. 2013). This refer—
ence genome, termed Os—Nipponbare—Reference—IRGSP—1.0 is pub—
licly available on the Rice Annotation Project (http://rice.
plantbiology.msu.edu/annotation_pseudo_current.shtml)

The paired—end data were assembled using SOAPdenovo using
default parameters. This assembly consists of 11 440 contigs larger
than 500 bp, cove 81.3% of the reference genome (22 317 126 in

size, 43.7% GC content). It has an N50 statistic of 1 680 499 exten—
sively misassembled contigs and 3 locally misassembled contigs. We
ran MISSEQUEL with default parameters and the SOAPdenovo assem—
bly, optical map and paired—end data as input. Similarly, we ran
REAPR with default parameters, and the SOAPdenovo assembly,
and paired—end data as input. Out of the 499 extensively misas—
sembled contigs, MISSEQUEL identified 374 of them (75 %), whereas
REAPR identified 30 (6%) and Pilon identified 25 (5%). Out of the
three locally misassembled contigs, MISSEQUEL identified all three,
but REAPR and Pilon identified none. Lastly, MISSEQUEL deemed
that 821 of the correctly assembled contigs were misassembled
(<1% FPR), whereas REAPR and Pilon deemed that 800 and 522
were deemed misassembled (<1% FPR), respectively. We further
note that both MISSEQUEL and REAPR agreed on 472 of these cor—
rectly assembled contigs; i.e. both REAPR and MISSEQUEL predicted
that 472 correctly assembled contigs are misassembled. This could
suggest that a broadened definition of misassembly by QUAST
would also deem these contigs to be misassembled.

3.2.2 Misassembly errors in the draft genome of budgerigar
A concerted effort has been in understanding the biodiversity of
many bird species (Jarvis et al. 2014)—including the budgerigar
genome—and thus, a significant amount of data have been gener—
ated for budgerigar. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) data, short read
Illumina data, 454 and optical mapping data have been generated
and used for the assembly of this genome. The sequence and op—
tical map data for the budgerigar genome were generated for the
Assemblathon 2 project of Bradnam et al. (2013). Budgerigar has a
GC content of approximately 43.8% (Jarvis et al. 2014) and con—
tains GC—rich (2 75%) regions (Howard et al. 2014). Sequence
data consist of a combination of Roche 454, Illumina and PacBio
reads, providing 16><, 285 X and 10>< coverage, respectively, of the
genome. All sequence reads are available at the NCBI Short Read
Archive (accession ERP002324). For our analysis, we consider the
assembly generated using CABOG (Miller et al. 2008), which was
completed by the CBCB team (Koren and Phillippy) as part of
Assemblathon 2 (Bradnam et al. 2013). The optical mapping data
were created by Zhou, Goldstein, Place, Schwartz and Bechner
using the SwaI restriction enzyme and consists of 92 separate
pieces.

Ganapathy et al (2014) released three hybrid assemblies; namely,
(i) budgerigar 454—Illumina hybrid v6.3 using the CABOG (Miller
et al. 2008) assembler; (ii) budgerigar PacBio corrected reads (PBcR)

hybrid using the CABOG assembler and (iii) budgerigar Illumina—
454 hybrid using the SOAPdenovo (version 2.04) (Li et al. 2010) as—
sembler. We downloaded the PBcR assembly (ii), the Illumina—454
hybrid assembly (iii), in addition to the optical mapping data and
pair—end data. The Illumina—454 assembly has 212203 contigs
(54 829 contigs 2 500 bp), N50 of 51034 and largest contig of
500 974 (Howard et al. 2014). The PBcR assembly has 77 556 con—
tigs, average, N50 of 102 885 and largest contig of 849 044
(Howard et al. 2014). We ran QUAST to evaluate the Illumina—454
hybrid assembly (all contigs 2 500 bp), using the PBcR assembly as
the reference genome. It reported 13 996 extensively misassembled
contigs and 2937 locally misassembled contigs. Thus, there are
39394 contigs that contain no misassembly error. We ran
MISSEQUEL on the Illumina—454 hybrid assembly on this using the
paired—end and optical mapping. MISSEQUEL correctly identified
10777 (out of 13 996) extensively misassembled contigs (77% MA
TPR) and 2350 (out of 2937) locally misassembled contigs (80%
local MA TPR); however, it incorrectly identified 4023 (out of the
39 394) as being misassembled (10%).

3.3 Practical considerations: memory and time

We evaluated the memory and time requirements of MISSEQUEL.
Since MISSEQUEL is a multi—threaded application, its wall—clock time
depends on the computing resources available to the user.
MISSEQUEL required a maximum of 8 threads, 16 GB and 1.5 h on all
assemblies of Etularensis and a maximum of 20 GB and 2.5h to
complete on all assemblies of loblolly pine. Most genome assemblers
require an incomparably greater amount of time and memory and
thus, from a practical perspective, the requirements of MISSEQUEL
are not a significant increase. The difference in the resource require—
ments of MISSEQUEL in comparison to modern assemblers is since it
operates contig—wise rather than genome—wise and therefore, only
deals with a significantly smaller portion of the data at a single time.
We conclude by mentioning that MISSEQUEL is not optimized for
memory and time and both could be further reduced but reimple—
menting the red—black positional de Bruijn graph using memory—
and time—succinct data structures.

4 Discussion and conclusions

This article describes the first non—proprietary computational
method for identifying misassembly errors using short read sequence
data and optical mapping data. Our results demonstrate (i) a sub—
stantial number of misassembly errors can be identified in draft gen—
omes of prokaryote and eukaryote species; (ii) our method works on
genomes that vary by GC—content and size; (iii) it can be used in
combination with any assembler and thus, making it a viable post—
processing step for any assembly and (iv) addresses the need for
methods to analyze optical mapping data.

One of our main contributions is the demonstration that optical
mapping can have significant benefit for misassembly error detec—
tion. A high FPR will result using paired—end data alone because of
ambiguous read mapping. Furthermore, superior results were al—
ways witnessed using paired—end data and optical mapping data. In
some cases, the improvement of using both datasets over a single
dataset was substantial. For example, the Velvet assembly of
Etularensis had 312 correctly assembled contigs; 76 of these 312
were deemed to be misassembled when MISSEQUEL was ran with op—
tical mapping data alone, whereas this improved to 68 out of 312
when both paired—end and optical mapping data were used.
Similarly, when MISSEQUEL was ran on this same assembly, 69%

(25/36) of locally misassembled contigs were identified, whereas this
improved to 100% (36/36) when both datasets were used.

Lastly, we point out two areas that warrant future work. One
area that merits investigation is to develop methods that will distin—
guish between structural variation heterozygosity and paralogous
variation and misassembly errors. MISSEQUEL is not able to detect
the difference between structural variation and misassembly
errors—and in fact, the high FPR might be due to this type of vari—
ation—however, methods that do so could be very valuable for fin—
ishing draft genomes. Lastly, we conclude by suggesting that
efficient algorithmic selection of enzymes that will yield such in—
formative optical maps in a de novo scenario is an area for interest—
ing and important future work.

ABSTRACT

Summary: CentiLib is a library and plug-in for the comprehensive
analysis and exploration of network centralities. It provides 17
different node centrality and four graph centrality measures in a user-
friendly interface and supports the exploration of analysis results
within the networks. Its architecture allows for easy adaption to
Java-based network analysis, simulation and visualization tools,
which is demonstrated by providing the plug-in for two popular
network analysis tools—Cytoscape and Vanted. With the ability
to quantitatively analyze biological networks in an interactive and
visual manner, CentiLib supports a better understanding of complex
biological networks and processes.

Availability and implementation: Software with manual and
tutorials is freely available at http://centilib.ipk-gaters|eben.de/

1 INTRODUCTION

The development of various highly parallel techniques for biological
research and data generation has led to the advance of methods to
analyze this data. Many tools have been developed to visualize,
rearrange, combine, edit and analyze biological data. Biological
networks, which can be derived from experimental data or
downloaded from publicly available databases, are an increasingly
important data structure in life science research. Since many
investigated networks are very large and elements are connected to
each other in many ways, it is still difﬁcult to analyze the structure of
such a network and the correlations between elements or groups of
elements. Therefore, several tools allow statistical, visual and other
analysis methods.

An important measurement to analyze networks, which is widely
used in other sciences such as sociology and becoming increasingly
signiﬁcant in biology, is the centrality of nodes. Centrality measures
are used to rank elements in a network according to different
importance concepts. This can be very helpful, especially for
biological networks, because often there are only a few elements
crucial to the underlying biological process. Centralities can help to
ﬁnd those elements without time- and cost-intensive experiments,
or can at least guide experiments.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

There are already some tools available which support the analysis
of network centralities. These are either stand-alone tools such as
Visone (Brandes and Wagner, 2005), Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar,
2003), Network Analyzer (Assenov et al., 2008) and CentiBiN
(Junker et al., 2006a), or extensions (plug-ins) to other tools such
as CentiScaPe (Seardoni et al., 2009) for Cytoscape. CentiBiN is
the stand-alone tool which offers most centralities. It provides 17
node centralities but the user has to install and become accustomed
to new software, and further analysis methods and functions such
as importing and analyzing experimental data are absent. A general
disadvantage of most stand-alone tools is that the biological context
is absent; hence one has to export the results and import them
in a biology-focused tool to compare and combine them with
other experimental data. CentiScaPe is a plug-in for Cytoscape
and therefore provides new ﬁlnctionality to a well-known tool
for biological network analysis. However, it is only available for
Cytoscape and it provides only nine centrality measures.

There are more stand-alone tools and extensions available but
all of them have similar disadvantages as those mentioned above.
To overcome these drawbacks and to make centrality measures
accessible to software tools which are already employed by users,
CentiLib bundles l7 node and four graph centralities in a Java
library, containing a ready-to-use user interface which can be
integrated into nearly every Java-based tool that works with graphs
and uses a plug-in mechanism. We provide this integration for two
tools, Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) and Vanted (Junker et (11.,
2006b), , see Figure l for a screenshot.

Besides the integration into existing tools, software developers are
able to use CentiLib as a pure Java library to compute all centralities
via a single and simple to use Class. Furthermore, CentiLib not only
allows the computation of centralities for directed and undirected
graphs but also for weighted ones.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

CentiLib is an easy-to-use library and user-friendly plug-in for the
analysis and Visual exploration of centralities in networks. It is
implemented in Java (requires Java 1.6 or later) and employs the open
source libraries JUNG2 (http://jung.sourceforgenetl) for graphs and Colt
(http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colU) for matrix operations. CentiLib focuses
on efﬁcient computation of centralities. for example. the centralities
betweenness. closeness. eccentricity. radiality and stress use the fast
algorithm of Brandes (Brandes. 2001) and are implemented in such a way
that all of them can be computed at once.

2.1 Centrality measures and exploration

CentiLib not only enables the computation of various centralities but also
the exploration of those values. The user can select elements in the graph to
see their ranks and values in a result list or select elements from the result list
to mark the appropriate graph elements. Once the most interesting elements
are selected, different centralities can be compared by switching through the
list of already computed ones.

Further analysis with other tools is possible by exporting the centrality
values in .Vec or .tsv format or saving them as node attributes in the graph. The
following node centralities are available: degree, in-/out-degree, eccentricity,
closeness, centroid, stress, radiality, current-ﬂow closeness, Katz status
index, shortest-path betweenness, current-ﬂow betweenness, eigenvector,
hits-hubs/-authorities, Hubbel index and Page-rank.

2.2 Library and plug-in

CentiLib aims to be reusable in an easy way for many different tools.
Therefore, CentiLib makes intensive use of Java interfaces. That is, the
generic J UNG2-interface Graph<V,E> must be implemented, and the graph
structure in question then wrapped to use the library. This way CentiLib
is independent of the data structures used and no further changes are
required. After wrapping the graph, centralities can be computed Via the
class CentralityHana’ler.

The integration of the contained ready-to-use user interface is done
similarly. Usually, plug-ins are commonly implemented for a single
application and therefore access the applications data structures directly
and communicate or interact with the application. Instead of this traditional
approach, CentiLib uses four interfaces to access the graphs, node names
and attributes; and one interface to interact with the application. Thus, an
adoption to another target application requires only the need to deﬁne those
interfaces.

2.3 User interface provided to Cytoscape and Vanted

The CentiLib user interface has so far been integrated as a plug-in into
Cytoscape and Vanted. It contains the panels Assistance, Graph statistics
and Results. To compute centralities, the user only needs to select, in the
Assistance panel, one or more graphs from a list, decide which centralities
they want to compute, and start the process. The results can be investigated
in the Results panel. By selecting the required graph and centrality, the user
gets a list with all nodes in descending order of their centrality value. List
elements can be marked in the graph by selecting them in the result list and
Vice versa. Because centrality values are only relative, the average value
for a given centrality is available too. To use computed values in other
programs or keep them for later sessions, they can be exported to ﬁles
or added as node attributes. Plotting the overall results as a histogram or
distribution dialog is also possible. To help users understanding a network,
the Graph statistics panel gives some information about a graph such

 

 

 

 

as simplicity, connectedness, loop-freeness, average distance, clustering
coefﬁcient, diameter and Wiener index. The Graph statistics panel also allows
edge weights selection. A dropdown list contains all available numeric edge
attributes. By selecting one of them, the appropriate values will be utilized as
edge weights in the computation of the centrality values. Another feature is
the location and extraction of connected or strongly connected components,
as some centralities can only be computed for (strongly) connected graphs.
Therefore, it is possible to create new graphs by extracting these components.

3 DISCUSSION

CentiLib is a library and graphical user interface that can be easily
adapted to many Java-based network analysis tools which provide
a plug-in mechanism. It provides 17 node centrality measures and
four graph centrality measures, covering a comprehensive set of
centralities. CentiLib is fast, user-friendly and allows not only the
computation and export of centralities, but also their exploration
in the network context. In addition to the library, two adapted
versions for Cytoscape and Vanted are provided. In contrast to
many other tools for the computation of centralities, CentiLib allows
the computation of centrality values also for weighted graphs. We
believe that the easy access to many established centrality measures
embedded in commonly used software tools will provide scientists
from the life sciences with new possibilities for meaningful analysis
of biological networks.

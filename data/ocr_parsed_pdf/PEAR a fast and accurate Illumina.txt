Fig. 1. Three possible scenarios for paired-end read lengths and target
DNA fragment lengths. (A) Short overlap between the paired-end reads;
(B) no overlap between the paired-end reads; (C) single-end read length is
larger than the target DNA fragment length

DNA fragments that are at least twice as long as the single—end
reads, PANDAseq exhibits a high false—positive rate (FPR).

Finally, most current paired—end mergers assume that the
DNA fragments are longer than the individual single—end
reads. When this does not hold, for example when sequencing
the V6 region of 16S rRNA genes of bacterial samples [fragment
sizes range between 110 and 130—bp (Gloor et al., 2010)] with
read lengths of 150—bp (see case C in Fig. 1), current mergers will
generate erroneous results.

Here we present PEAR, a fast and accurate paired—end read
merger. PEAR merges reads by maximizing the assembly score
(AS) of the read overlap via a scoring matrix that penalizes
mismatches with a negative value ﬂ and rewards matches with
a positive value a. Our approach takes quality scores and
sequence matches into account. It does not require preprocessing
of the raw data or specifying the fragment size. Furthermore,
PEAR neither requires prior information on read length nor
target fragment size. It can reliably identify reads that can
either be merged or need to be discarded. The program is accur—
ate on datasets with (i) short overlaps and (ii) DNA target frag—
ment sizes that are smaller than single—end read lengths.

To identify false—positive merged reads, we propose a statis—
tical test that is based on the observed expected alignment scores
(OESs). On simulated paired—end reads with a mean overlap of
20—bp (Section 3.1), PEAR correctly merges 90.44% of the frag—
ments with a FPR of 2.78% when our statistical test is disabled.
It correctly merges 70.06% of the fragments with a FPR of only
0.48% when the signiﬁcance level of the test is set to 1%. The
best competing merger (PANDAseq) correctly merges 83.51% of
the fragments, but with a FPR of 6.65%.

We implemented PEAR in C. It includes an optimized
memory management scheme that allows the user to specify
the amount of random access memory (RAM) available for
executing the program. Therefore, it can be deployed on off—
the—shelf desktop and laptop computers as well as on high—end
multi—core servers. In Section 2.4 we outline why PEAR becomes
faster when using less memory. Finally, the parallel version of
PEAR scales linearly with the number of cores.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

In paired—end sequencing mode, the Illumina Consensus
Assessment of Sequence and Variation (CASAVA) software gen—
erates two FASTQ files (Cock et al., 2010), one for each reading
direction of the fragment. The ﬁles contain exactly the same

number of reads. Corresponding paired—end reads can be identi—
ﬁed by their coordinates in the ﬂow cell. The Illumina flow cell is
a planar optically transparent surface similar to a microscope
slide. It contains a lawn of oligonucleotide anchors bound to
its surface.

PEAR scores all possible overlaps for each pair of correspond—
ing paired—end reads to determine the overlap with the highest
AS. Subsequently, PEAR conducts a statistical test to assess the
statistical signiﬁcance of the merged reads. If the merged reads
do not pass this test or if the overlap length is smaller than a
user—deﬁned threshold (based on the expected approximate
sequence length in the experiment) the pair of reads will not be
merged. Otherwise, PEAR returns the merged fragment and will
also correct errors using the Illumina quality scores.

2.1 Overlap algorithm

For each base, CASAVA (v1.8) yields an ASCII—encoded quality
score that represents an integer value Q, which can be converted
into the probability e of a sequencing error at the base via
e = 10¥ (e = 10% in earlier CASAVA versions). The base
frequency b of a nucleotide is the number of occurrences of
that nucleotide in the FASTQ ﬁles divided by the total number
of bases. The probability (1 of a random base match is
(1 2 P31 + PZT + P26 + P? Given an overlapping region
C 2: (X, Y), where X and Y are the overlapping segments of
the two reads, we denote the observed (respectively true) base
at position i of the overlap by X ,~, Y,~ (respectively X}, Yj). We
denote the length of the overlap region by |C|. The probability
that base X,- (resp. Y ,-) is erroneous is eX, (resp. eYl.). Assuming
that errors are independent events, we can calculate the prob—
ability of a true base match, given the observed base match as

The probability of a true base match, given the observed base

(Nakamura et al., 201 1)] with a scoring matrix that rewards matches
by a positive value a and penalizes mismatches with a negative value
6. Scoring matrices for evaluating sequence alignments are being
routinely used, for instance, in Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(Altschul and Gish, 1996) and Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg,
2012). Empirical tests using simulated data showed that setting
a 2: 1.0 and ﬂ 2: —1.0 yield the best results (data not shown).
Given the overlap C 2: (X, Y), we deﬁne AS as

Z (my, 2 Y:.|X,~ = Y,~] -oi)5’(Pr[X; 75 Km 75 Yi] - W’s"

i:l...|C|
where

6. _ 1 2 A match is observed (X,~ : Y,~)
' _ 0 2 A mismatch is observed (X ,~ 75 Y ,~)

For the merged reads, PEAR computes the overlap that
maximizes the AS. We denote the overlap that maximizes the
AS by C*.

2.2 Statistical test

To test the signiﬁcance of the merged reads and to identify reads
that shall not be merged, we calculate a P—value for the null
hypothesis that the two corresponding reads are independent
from each other. By independent we mean that any overlap
between the two reads is purely by chance. For an overlap
C: (X, Y) between two reads x and y, we deﬁne OES(C) to
be the observed expected alignment score (OES)

OES(C) = 2 PM = Y2IX.~, Ya - a + PrtX; sé Km, In] - 13

i:l...|C|
and

O/ES(X,y,a)) : A max OES(C)
C e D(x, y, m)
where D(x, y, co) is the set of all possible overlaps between se—
quences x and y with a size of at least a).

Let 5: and y be two independent random sequences and let us
further assume that there are no sequencing errors. Then, the
P—value, that is, the probability of a random sequence producing
an OES that is at least as high as the OES obtained from the
ragged reads. The P—value is defined as the probability of
OES(SC, )7, co) being greater or equal than the observed
OES(C*). We obtain

Pr(O/ES(SC, y”, co) 3 OES(C*)) = 1 — Pr(OES(C”‘)>O/\ES(.>E, y”, (0))

By default, PEAR uses an OES with a P <0.01 as cutoff. If the
OES of the best merged read is smaller than this value, the reads
will not be merged. Choosing a smaller P—value will reduce the
FPR of the merged sequences, but a lower number of reads will
be merged.

If the underlying overlap size is unknown, a) can be set to 1.0.
If, however, the overlap is known to be short (335—bp in our
simulations), our statistical test will reject up to 4% (based on
our simulations) correctly merged sequences because of low qual—
ity scores. To recover more merged reads, we provide the possi—
bility to set a) to the computed overlap size after the merging
step, instead of using a predeﬁned fixed value. However, when
using this work—around, the P—value of the statistical test is not
valid anymore, as a) depends on the output of our algorithm.
This implies that the random sequences are more restricted when
choosing overlaps than the original input sequences. We will
refer to the aforementioned, valid P—value as the maximal
accepted probability (MAP). Our tests show that PEAR can pro—
duce 4% more merged sequences using MAP at the cost of a
slight (~0.1%) increase in FPRs.

2.3 Output

PEAR generates four FASTQ output ﬁles. One contains the suc—
cessfully merged reads, two ﬁles contain the forward and reverse
unmerged reads and one the discarded reads. Discarded reads are
reads that fail to pass one of the following quality ﬁlters, which
are applied after the merging process. These ﬁlters require the
user to set some program parameters, which are outlined below.

Minimal quality score for trimming
It is common to trim the reads and use their high quality part
due to the low quality of base calls toward the end of Illumina
reads (Caporaso et al., 2011). Consequently, PEAR includes
the option to trim unmerged reads that contain at least two
consecutive bases with quality scores lower than a user—speci—
ﬁed minimal quality score value.

Minimal length of output sequences
PEAR discards merged sequences or trimmed unmerged reads
that are shorter than this threshold.

Maximal length of the output sequences
PEAR discards sequences longer than the speciﬁed maximal
length.

Maximal proportion of uncalled bases
This parameter allows for discarding reads that contain more
than the speciﬁed proportion of uncalled bases N. When the
value is set to 0, it will discard all reads containing one or more
uncalled bases N.

Now, assume two reads x and y can be merged and have an
overlapping region C. PEAR will correct errors in the overlap—
ping region and compute updated quality scores for the overlap.
For every pair of corresponding observed bases X and Y in
C and their quality scores eX and e yﬁ, respectively, we distinguish
four casesiX and Y are identical, different, one of them is
uncalled or both of them are uncalled. When the two bases are
identical, PEAR simply inserts this base into the corresponding

 

616

ﬁm'spzumol‘pmJXO'sopeuHOJmoiq/ﬁdnq

PEAR

 

position in the merged sequence and assigns the product of the
quality scores: eXeY because errors are independent from each
other (see Section 2.1). When the base pairs are different, PEAR
inserts the base with the highest quality score and the corres—
ponding quality score. If (only) one of the two bases is uncalled
(N), PEAR uses the called base and its quality score. Finally, if
both bases are uncalled, we arbitrarily use the lower of the two
quality scores, as a quality score is required to obtain a valid
FASTQ output ﬁle.

2.4 Parallelization and memory management

PEAR target platforms are off—the—shelf laptop and desktop
computers. We implemented an appropriate memory allocator
and manager that allows PEAR to use only a predeﬁned amount
of memory that the user can specify via a command—line switch.
PEAR can use several gigabytes, but also just a few kilobytes of
RAM.

Current off—the—shelf laptops and servers consist of multi—core
processors with a minimum number of two cores per processor,
thus increasing the total processing power of the system.
However, RAM clock rates are still slower than CPU clock
rates (also known as ‘memory—gap’). Thus, the time required
for loading data from RAM into cache memories and registers
can lead to performance deterioration.

To increase efﬁciency, PEAR takes into account both proper—
ties of modern hardware, that is, memory access patterns and the
number of cores. Currently, most tools process sets of paired—end
reads iteratively. They load a set of reads and merge them until
all reads in this set have been merged. Because disk accesses are
serial, most tools suffer from waiting times induced by loading
reads into RAM and the caches. To alleviate this performance
bottleneck, PEAR uses a standard double—buffering technique.
The main idea of double—buffering techniques is to split—up the
available RAM (speciﬁed by the user) into two buffers of equal
size, which we denote as active and passive buffer. At program
start—up there is an initial latency until the active buffer has been
ﬁlled with reads for the first time. Then, a dedicated thread
(which we denote as reader thread) loads a second set of reads
into the passive buffer, whereas the remaining threads process
the reads in the active buffer. If the reader thread has already
loaded the next set while the remaining threads are still process—
ing the reads in the active buffer, the reader thread will also start
merging reads. In the opposite case, the remaining threads will
idle until the reader thread has ﬁlled the passive buffer. Thus, to
obtain ‘good’ parallel performance, the buffer size needs to be
adapted to the system at hand (see later in the text).

Each thread only merges ~500 reads from the active buffer at
a time. This per—thread set size of 500 yielded the best perform—
ance in our experiments (data not shown)

When all reads in the active buffer have been processed, the
ﬁrst thread that ﬁnishes merging its assigned reads will become
the reader. The reader swaps the active buffer with the passive
buffer by simply ﬂipping a memory pointer. Subsequently, it will
start ﬁlling the new passive buffer with the next reads from the
input ﬁle. The remaining threads will start processing reads from
the new active buffer. Thereby, we can parallelize the process of
reading from disk and merging reads. By using this technique, we
hide the latency of disk accesses and can use the majority of

threads/cores for merging short reads and thus reduce overall
run time.

We observed that the optimal RAM setting on a 48 core
Magny—Cours system (see Section 3.4 for details) is 200 MB.
This is because each disk access only reads ~100 MB, as we
use two buffers of size 100 MB each. Thus, the disk access
latency is overlapped by the remaining threads that work on
the reads in the active buffer. On four cores of the same hardware
conﬁguration, the optimal empirical setting is 50 MB.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To evaluate PEAR and compare it with the three state—of—the—art
mergers (FLASH v1.2.6, PANDAseq v2.4, COPE v1.1.2), we
used simulated datasets with varying overlap and DNA fragment
sizes as well as the following two empirical datasets:

(1) deep sequencing data of the Staphylococcus aureus genome
by MacCallum et al. (2009),

(2) reads generated from paired—end sequencing of a known
single sequence (template) used by Masella et al. (2012) to
test PANDAseq.

3.1 Simulated data

To mimic the sequencing of multiple hypervariable regions of
16S rRNA, we extracted a reference sequence dataset of 1000
full—length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences from the RDP
classiﬁer training dataset (Wang et al., 2007). We then used ART
(v1.5.0) (Huang et al., 2012) to simulate 100—bp paired—end reads,
with mean target DNA fragment sizes of 101, 150, 165, 180, 190
and 250—bp, and a standard deviation of 10—bp. We set the par—
ameters of ART to generate target DNA fragments by randomly
sampling the reference sequences until a 10—fold coverage of the
reference dataset was reached. To obtain a more realistic test
dataset, we used two read quality proﬁles for simulating either
end of the respective pairs. The target DNA fragments produced
by ART provide the ground truth for the merged paired—end
reads.

We also generated an additional set of 150—bp long reads with
a mean fragment size of 101—bp, by extending all single reads in
the above 101—bp fragment size set to a length of 150—bp. We
extended the reads by complete random sequences with the
lowest possible quality scores. This setup emulates case C (see
Fig. 1) where the DNA fragment size is smaller than the length of
a single—end read.

We executed PEAR, COPE, FLASH and PANDAseq on the
above datasets and compared the lengths of the merged reads
with the true fragment lengths. We only consider merged
sequences whose length is equal to the true fragments size as
correct merged sequences. When the fragment size is at least
twice as long as the single read length, we consider that a
result returning unmerged reads is correct. We executed PEAR
with three different settings: (i) statistical test disabled, (ii)
P : 0.01 and (iii) MAP: 0.01. In all tests the minimum overlap
size is 1; for all other parameters we use the default values. We
ran PANDAseq with default parameters as well as with a min—
imal overlap setting of 10—bp. FLASH requires the mean frag—
ment length and a proper minimal overlap value to work

correctly. Therefore, we ran it with the known/true mean frag—
ment lengths. COPE includes four different modes of execution.
Mode 0 is similar to the FLASH approach, but with more
stringent alignment score parameters. Modes 1 and 2 further
use k—mer frequencies, and full—mode runs all three modes
sequentially and concatenates the results. COPE generated a
segmentation fault on our simulated data under COPE modes
1 and 2. Therefore, we only report results obtained under COPE
mode 0.

Table 1 shows experimental results. With the exception of the
ﬁrst test case (no overlaps), PEAR consistently generates a larger
number of correctly merged sequences when the statistical test is
disabled. PEAR merges fewer correct fragments when the statis—
tical test is enabled. When setting the P—value or MAP to 0.01,
PEAR shows lower FPRs than all three competing mergers.
When we use MAP to evaluate the merged reads, PEAR pro—
duces more merged reads with an FPR that is analogous to the
FPR generated by PEAR with the statistical test. PEAR is robust
with respect to short overlaps because it can still merge ~40% of
the reads when the mean overlap is only 10—bp. The FPR of
0.64% (MAP:0.01) under this setting is 10 times lower than
for FLASH and PANDAseq. When reads do not overlap,
PEAR classiﬁes them as unmerged with an FPR of 0.03%.
Here, the FPR is defined as the fraction of merged reads that
should not have been merged. Overall, PEAR shows low FPRs
across all test scenarios (overlap lengths). In addition, it does not
require any prior knowledge regarding overlap lengths.
Therefore, PEAR can be used for merging sequences with vary—
ing fragment sizes. PANDAseq performs equally well as PEAR
for the majority of cases where the overlaps exceed 20—bp.
However, its FPR increases with decreasing overlap size, regard—
less of the minimal overlap size setting. Furthermore,
PANDAseq incorrectly merges 55.4% of the reads that do not
overlap and 25.11% of the reads when the mean overlap is set
to 10—bp. We will discuss the reasons for this behavior in
Section 3.5.

FLASH failed to merge the majority of reads for small overlap
sizes, but exhibits low FPRs for merged sequences. FLASH
merges reads by maximizing the fraction f (number of matches
to overlap size ratio). The default threshold of f in FLASH is
0.75 and the default minimal overlap size (co) is 10. This setting
can be shown to have a P—value of 0.00156 for merged reads by
using the statistical test introduced in Section 2.2 and replacing
OES with f. However, overlaps that exclusively maximize f might
not yield correctly merged sequences. Let us consider two pos—
sible overlap sizes col and cog for paired—end reads x and y, where
co1<cog. As an example, we assume col 2: 10 with 1 mismatch,
cog 2: 50 with 6 mismatches and a true overlap size of cog. Then
fw] : 0.9 >wa : 0.88 and FLASH will choose the overlap of size
co as merged read. Because OESw] : 9<0ESw2 : 38, PEAR
will return the correct result. FLASH also requires the mean
fragment length as input, which restrains its applicability to data—
sets with uniform fragment length.

COPE, PANDAseq and FLASH were unable to merge
reads under application scenario C (see Fig. 1) where the DNA
fragment size is smaller than a single—end read (Table 1).
PANDAseq incorrectly merges over one—third of the reads in
this scenario.

the merged reads to the reference genome. We use the corres—
ponding end—to—end mode in Bowtie2 and do not allow for open—
ing gaps in either sequence (the reads and the reference genome).
This guarantees that all merged reads that can be mapped to the
reference genome are correctly merged. This is because there are
two possible scenarios for incorrectly merged reads: (i) they can
be longer than the corrected one, in which case the sequences can
be aligned by opening gaps in the reference sequence or (ii) they
are shorter than the corrected one, and the sequences can be
aligned by opening gaps in the merged sequences. Therefore,
we consider that a merged paired—end read is correct only if
Bowtie2 ﬁnds a hit on the reference genome. Note that, the
results are conservative because some of the correctly merged
reads might be missed by Bowtie2 due to sequencing errors.
We summarize the results in Table 2. All mergers work well in
this setting. PANDAseq correctly merges the highest amount of
reads; PEAR ~2% less (statistical test disabled). Nonetheless, a
quarter of the reads merged by PANDAseq were not mapped to
the reference genome using Bowtie2. In contrast only 4.9% of the
merged reads from PEAR could not be mapped. COPE merges
less reads than PEAR and shows a lower FPR when the statis—
tical test in PEAR is disabled. This is likely because COPE is
speciﬁcally designed for such deep sequencing datasets.

3.3 Single known sequence data

We used a dataset that was deployed by Masella et al. (2012) to
assess PANDAseq. The dataset contains paired—end reads from a
single template sequence. The template sequence is the V3 region
Of the Methylococcus capsulatus (ATCC 33009) 168 rRNA gene.
It has a length of 198—bp, including the primers. The FASTQ files
contain 673 845 pairs of 108—bp long paired—end reads. Each pair
overlaps by exactly 18—bp. We calculate the ‘true’ merged reads
by computing a global pairwise sequence alignment between the
merged reads and the template sequence. Subsequently, we check
if the overlapping region contains gaps, we consider a merged
read to be correct if there is no gap. We also calculate the ER of
the merged reads to evaluate error correction performance. The
ER is the average number of errors per merged read (excluding
gaps) with respect to the template sequence. We ran PEAR
with default parameters. We executed PANDAseq with default
parameters and with a minimum overlap setting of 10—bp.

We applied FLASH with a template sequence length of 198—bp
and a read length of 108—bp.

For this dataset, PEAR merges the highest number of reads
when the statistical test is disabled (Table 3). When setting
P : 0.01 and using the test, less reads are merged, but only
0.03% of the merged reads are false positives. Both,
PANDAseq and FLASH, produce comparable results but with
a slightly higher FPR. We executed COPE in full mode (see
Section 3.1) on this dataset. COPE did not merge any reads,
however. The ER of the raw reads is 0.51. Although the overlap
size is only 18—bp all mergers decrease the ER. Merged reads
produced by FLASH and PANDAseq show ERs that are
slightly lower than PEAR (statistical test disabled). However,
PEAR yields three times lower ERs when the statistical test is
enabled.

3.4 Run time and memory requirement

To compare run times between PEAR and competing mergers,
we used the dataset from Section 3.3. We conducted experiments
on an AMD Opteron 6174 2.2 GHz 4—processor machine with 12
cores each and a total of 48 cores. We used the default PEAR
memory setting of 200 MB. PANDAseq is the fastest tool on a
single core. Surprisingly, when running the experiment with four
cores, which corresponds to a standard desktop PC, PANDAseq
is slower than for the sequential run, whereas PEAR and
FLASH are equally fast and twice as fast as PANDAseq.
However, the main observation is that neither PANDAseq nor
FLASH yields substantial speedups when executed on several
cores (see Fig. 2). In fact, although PEAR yields linear speedups,
FLASH and PANDAseq yield no speedup at all. We excluded
COPE from most experiments because it does not merge any
reads for this dataset and because it has only been partially
parallelized; only the k—mer computation is parallelized. For
the sake of completeness, the overall run time of COPE on this
dataset is 395 s using the parallel k—mer computation on 48 cores
(minimum memory requirement of 16 GB). Hence, COPE is
substantially slower than the other programs we tested.

We also tested PEAR, FLASH and PANDAseq on a substan—
tially larger dataset of 36 504 800 101—bp long paired—end reads
from the human chromosome 14 (data available at http2//gage.
cbcb.umd.edu/data). Using 48 cores, PEAR only requires 62s to
ﬁnish, whereas FLASH and PANDAseq need 7 and 21.5 min,
respectively.

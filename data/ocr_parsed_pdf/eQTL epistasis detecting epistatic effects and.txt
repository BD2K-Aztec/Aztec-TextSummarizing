Abstract

Motivation: Epistasis is the interactions among multiple genetic variants. It has emerged to explain
the 'missing heritability’ that a marginal genetic effect does not account for by genome—wide asso—
ciation studies, and also to understand the hierarchical relationships between genes in the genetic
pathways. The Fisher’s geometric model is common in detecting the epistatic effects. However,
despite the substantial successes of many studies with the model, it often fails to discover the func—
tional dependence between genes in an epistasis study, which is an important role in inferring hier—
archical relationships of genes in the biological pathway.

Results: We justify the imperfectness of Fisher’s model in the simulation study and its application
to the biological data. Then, we propose a novel generic epistasis model that provides a flexible so—
lution for various biological putative epistatic models in practice. The proposed method enables
one to efficiently characterize the functional dependence between genes. Moreover, we suggest a
statistical strategy for determining a recessive or dominant link among epistatic expression quanti—
tative trait locus to enable the ability to infer the hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is
assessed by simulation experiments of various settings and is applied to human brain data regard—
ing schizophrenia.

1 Introduction

Epistasis, the interaction effect among unlinked loci or between
genes, makes a considerable contribution to phenotypic variation in
the polygenic mechanism of complex human diseases such as psychi—
atric disorder, diabetes and cancer. Nonetheless, many studies that
identify the genetic susceptible factors tend to ignore the interaction
effects between loci (Carlborg and Haley, 2004; Pandey et (11.,

2012). It is not surprising at all that the investigations of the genetic
variability of individual genes by genome—wide association study
give the explanation only up to 40% in psychiatric disorder (Pandey
et (11., 2012). This fact implies that there should indeed be a ‘missing
heritability’. The missing heritability may include the interaction be—
tween multiple genes and environmental factors (Eichler et (11.,
2010; Pandey et (11., 2012).

eQTL epistasis

Although epistasis studies traditionally take into account qualita—
tive categories of phenotypes, the recent rapid development of high—
throughput technologies, such as gene microarray, enables one to
characterize the quantitative interaction, e.g. gene expression. Gene
expression is an intermediate molecular phenotype between geno—
type and the higher level phenotypes such as human diseases. For
the quantitative analysis, the expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTL) mapping studies have prevailed to identify susceptible gen—
etic loci and capture the insight of the genetic architecture of gene
expression. Furthermore, the importance of detecting the quantita—
tive epistasis analysis is recently being emphasized in many studies
(Huang et (11., 2013; Mackay, 2014).

When William Bateson created the terminology, epistasis, it
described the non—independent prediction of segregation ratios by
the action of individual gene (Bateson, 1909). However, epistasis
has been interpreted in various ways to describe different phenom—
ena for the last 100 years (Cordell, 2002; Phillips, 2008). The uses
of the term, epistasis, were viewed with three different perspectives:
(1) compositional epistasis, (2) statistical epistasis and (3) functional
epistasis (Phillips, 2008). To be short, compositional epistasis
represents the biological phenomena that one allelic effect masks an
allele at another locus, which describes the traditional meaning of
epistasis. The presence of the compositional epistasis can be
interpreted in the biological hierarchy between genes (Aylor and
Zeng, 2008; Cordell, 2009; Phenix et (11., 2011). Statistical epistasis
takes into account Fisher’s model and its deviations, which describe
the combinatory genetic effect within a population. The functional
epistasis, which is also called protein—protein interaction, is not
dealt with in this article since the functional epistasis considers
the molecular interactions between protein without genetic
description.

Compositional epistasis emphasizes the functional dependence
between genes. It aims to infer gene regulatory networks or signaling
pathways. Epistasis occurs when one allelic effect is modified or
blocked by an allele at another locus, or when the combined mul—
tiple genetic variants produce non—Mendelian segregation ratios
against the individual genetic effect. Since genes must be interacting
with others, at least on the same pathway, the interactive effect to
phenotype is clear. When a genetic mutation has the ‘stopping’ or
‘standing above’ effect to another mutation, the mutation is said to
be epistatic and can be interpreted as the gene is downstream of the
other. The epistatic relationship between the Melanocortin 1 recep—
tor (Mc1r) and agouti on the coat color genetic pathway of a mouse
is a good example to show the epistatic relationship (Fig. 1)
(Phillips, 2008). As shown in the 3 X 3 genotype contingency table
in Figure 1A, the body colors of the offspring were investigated with
all the combinations of knockout mutations of the genes. Mc1r
seems to regulate the functionality of the genetic effect of agouti.
That is, mc1r is the downstream gene of agouti in the melanocyte
pathway. The melanocyte pathway can elucidate the epistatic rela—
tionship between the genes in Figure 1B.

The quantitative epistasis analysis, eQTL epistasis, holds signifi—
cant promise in inferring the hierarchical relationships between
genes in biological pathways and its enrichment as well as the quali—
tative epistasis study (Aylor and Zeng, 2008; Cordell, 2009; Phenix
et (11., 2011). The hierarchical interpretation of the epistatic gene
pairs enables one to construct or enrich the biological pathways.
A number of regression—based methods have been suggested for
inferring the gene regulatory network and their hierarchical rela—
tionships. As the classical quantitative epistasis analysis, the regres—
sion—based approaches investigated the data that include reciprocal
effects on the triplet combination of deletion mutant of a gene

(Aylor and Zeng, 2008; Phenix et (11., 2011). The studies have suc—
ceeded in inferring the hierarchical pathways of the genes as well as
a rule between the interaction, for example, activating or repressing
the downstream gene. However, the experiments were required tre—
mendously expensive experiments for gene deletions, which is un—
feasible to measure the effects of all possible gene deletions in
practice.

Most epistasis studies have been performed by using the statis—
tical approach of Fisher’s. Recently, the limitations of the statistical
epistasis have been argued, and the development of a new approach
has consistently been demanded (Cordell, 2002, 2009;
VanderWeele, 2010; Wan et (11., 2013). In this article, we develop a
novel method to solve two problems: (i) detecting the compositional
epistasis and (ii) identifying the genetic hierarchical relationship be—
tween genes based using a regression model. We first present the
biologically putative epistasis models and Fisher’s model in Sections
2.1 and 2.2. Then, a generic epistasis model (GEM) is suggested to
represent the biological models in Section 2.3. The optimal solutions
for the parameter estimation of GEM are derived in Section 2.4. For
the second problem, we propose a statistical approach to determine
the hierarchical relationships when an epistasis occurs in the mul—
tiple genes in Section 2.5. In the simulation studies in Section 3.1,
we show the performance of GEM, comparing Fisher’s model on the
various designed settings. We also apply GEM to the human brain
data of schizophrenia, where the epistasis findings are described and
a gene hierarchy on schizophrenia is inferred.

2 Methods

2.1 Biological models for eQTL epistasis

Three explicit models for the interaction between multiple loci were
elucidated (Marchini et (11., 2005) for genome—wide epistasis, which
are: (i) multiplicative within and between loci (corresponding to
Model I in our work), (ii) two—locus interaction multiplicative effects
(corresponding to Model 111) and (iii) two—locus interaction thresh—
old effects (corresponding to Model IV of our work). Model I speci—
fies the minor allelic effects increasing in a multiplicative fashion
both within and between loci with the different genetic effect size
(r1 and Q) of each locus. The baseline effect 06 describes the back—
ground effect when no mutation exists. Model 111 is equivalent to
Fisher’s model, where it has equal genetic effect size at the two loci
(r1 : r2 : r). Model IV is a deviation of Model 111 with a threshold,
where the equal effect of the mutation (no matter what the minor al—
lele number) is considered.

Although the above models were designed for the odds of dis—
eases (qualitative analysis), the models can be converted for the
eQTL epistasis analysis (quantitative analysis) by replacing the odds
with the gene expression levels. The new models are illustrated in
Figure 2, in which the models are modified for the eQTL epistasis,
and an additory model (multiplicative with threshold within and
between loci, Model 11) is added.

are depicted with 01:1, r1 21.5, r2 : 4, r: 1.5

2.2 Deviation of Fisher’s model

The deviation in the multiplicative model from Fisher’s geometric
model is common in detecting the epistatic effects. Fisher defined
epistasis by using the interaction term in an additive fashion (Fisher,
1918). However, since the late 1960s, due to the dependency issue
of the additive manner, a deviation of a multiplicative model for the
interaction term has begun to be used, and this regression—based
model is still most widely applied in many studies (Cordell, 2002;
Schupbach et 41]., 2010; Lee and Xing, 2012; Huang et 41]., 2013).
The statistical interaction model (called Fisher’s model hereafter) is
formed as,

yzﬁo+ﬁ1x1 +ﬁ2x2+312x1x2+87 (1)

where genotypes at a single locus are represented by the number of
minor alleles and 8 N N (0, 02). Testing the significance of the inter—
action term lin is performed by comparing with the following mar—
ginal model:

yzﬁo+ﬁ1x1+ﬁ2x2 +8- (2)

A significant interaction term represents that Equation (1) explains a
significantly larger proportion of phenotypic variance in quantita—
tive trait than Equation (2) which involves only marginal effects of
the two individual genetic loci. Therefore, the significant interaction
term determines the presence of the epistatic effects between the two
loci. The significance is assessed by t—statistic.

Despite the substantial success by Fisher’s model in epistasis
studies, it is often imperfect to represent all putative epistatic phe—
nomena in biology. The limitations of Fisher’s model for the com—
positional epistasis have been investigated by researchers (Cordell,
2002, 2009; VanderWeele, 2010; Wan et 41]., 2013).

2.3 GEM for eQTL epistasis

We propose a GEM for detecting complex eQTL epistatic effects
with adapting kernel function 420, where the kernel function is rede—
fined for the targeting epistatic effects.

3’ : ﬁo + ﬁlxl + [3le + ﬁiz’f(x1)rtf(x2) + 87 (3)

where y is the continuous values of the observed phenotype (e.g.
gene expression level), and x1 and x2 are the genotypic data of the
two loci, where single—nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are con—
sidered in diploid organisms. [31 and [32 are the coefficients of the
marginal effect on x1 and x2, respectively. [312 is the coefficient of
the epistatic genotypic effect between the two loci. r1 and r2 show
the genotypic effect sizes of the two loci. Note that n: 1 describes
no epistatic effect at locus i. 0 < r,- < 1 represents the degrading ef—
fect, whereas r,- > 1 shows the propagating effect by the allele at the
ith locus.

Using the kernel function, we can consider various epistasis mod—
els in the single analytical expression form. For instance, the kernel
function for Model I can be defined as

2 if xizaa.
<p(xi)Mode1 1 = 1 if xiZAa- (4)
0 if x,-:AA.

In the same sense, the kernel function for Model II is

1 if xizaa.
@(xi)Model 11 I 1 if xiZAa- (5)
0 if x,:AA.

More specifically, GEM for the instance of the two loci of ‘Aa’ and
‘bb’ in Model I becomes (see the table in Fig. 2A),

yzﬁo+ﬁ1 +2ﬁ2+3127iV§ (6)

Models III and IV can be considered as the specialized models of
Models I and II respectively, where n : r2 : r. Therefore, the ker—
nel functions for Models I and II can also easily deal with Models III
and IV instead of using additional kernel definition. We will con—
sider the two kernel functions throughout this study.

2.4 Optimization

Given a number of samples, we can characterize the global genetic
effects by optimizing the parameters to the sample. Let x,- be a col—
umn vector of SNP at the ith locus, and y be a column vector of gene

The learning function (7) is non—convex. Nevertheless, the gradi—
ent of the learning function with respect to each parameter can be eas—
ily computed. Since there is no analytic closed form for the optimal
solution, the local optimum is obtained by the coordinate descent
algorithm. The solution for the parameters will be presented here.

In the coordinate descent algorithm, the parameters are esti—
mated iteratively: r : {11,12} are estimated by Proposition 2.1 with
given [31, [32 and [312, and then the coefficients [312, [31 and [32, are al—
ternatively estimated by Proposition 2.2. The iterative optimization
is performed until they converge. Note that the estimation sequence
of the parameters is important in the proposed method, i.e. in the
order of 1' : {11,12}, [312, [31 and [32. Consideration of the coefficients
of the main effects ([31 and [32) prior to the epistatic effects
(1' : {11,12} and [312) makes the epistatic effects to be neglected, but
main effects to be emphasized. In other words, the estimation of the
epistatic effects in advance of the main effects enables us to detect
the epistatic effects even if there are no main effects.

The genotypic effect sizes r1 and r2 play an important role in
determining the gene hierarchy. Fisher’s model takes into account
only the presence or absence of the interaction effects, i.e. epistasis.
Therefore, it lacks to infer the hierarchy of the genes involved in the
epistasis, which it consequently has limits to biologically interpret
the epistatic phenomena. Introduction of the genotypic effect sizes r1
and r2 into the GEM makes it possible to infer the hierarchical
orders of the genes. The detailed description for the identification
approach of the hierarchical relationships in the epistasis will be
shown in Section 2.5. The proofs of the propositions and the algo—
rithm are provided in the Supplementary Material.

Testing the significance of the interaction term [312 is performed
in the same way as Fisher’s model presented in Section 2.2. The sig—
nificant interaction term shows the presence of epistasis between
two loci to the gene expression of a target gene.

2.5 Inference of hierarchical relationships between
genes

In this section, we propose a statistical strategy in order to infer the
hierarchical relationships between genes, when their epistatic effect
is detected. The proposed GEM detects complex epistatic effects
underlying a targeting biological interaction model. However, it is
still challenging to infer hierarchical relationships between the genes
in epistatic effects. The significant interaction term ([312) shows the
presence or absence of epistasis, but it does not explain the hierarch—
ical order. In the GEM, the genetic effect size at the individual locus,
r1 and r2, enables one to compare their effect size to the phenotype
variation. For instance, the genetic effect size of Locus 1 (r1 : 1.5) is
much less than of Locus 2 (r2 : 4) in Model I in Figure 2. It shows
that the genetic variants of Locus 2 may repress the genetic effects of
Locus 1 on the activation of the gene. Also, it can be interpreted as
the dominance of the effect size in the epistasis. Therefore, the statis—
tical testing of each genetic effect size may provide the hierarchical
relationships between the genes.

Given the detected paired genetic loci of epistasis, the tests of sig—
nificance of the genetic effect size are individually performed by
comparing with a model which consists of only marginal effects
(null hypothesis). That is, the individual genetic effect size terms are
considered separately as,

y = 130 +ﬁ1x1+ﬁ2xz +ﬁ,,rf("” Hind“) +2. (15>

The significant [3,] and [3,2 show the dominance of the effect size in
the epistasis. All possible determinations of the hierarchical relation—
ship between the genes are illustrated in Table 1. L1+ represents
the first locus whose coefficient [3,1 is rejected to the null hypothesis,
i.e. p(/)’,1) < 0.05, whereas L1_ shows the insignificant genetic

is the gene that the two genetic effects contribute to.

Since either detecting the gene order from the hierarchical rela—
tionships or inferring exact gene—regulatory/signaling pathways are
beyond the scope of this study, we would not go further in depth.
However, we brieﬂy address how to derive the gene hierarchy from
the proposed method. From the epistasis study, a series of a set of
genetic variations manifesting the epistatic relationship and the cor—
responding gene expression are provided. By performing the pro—
posed statistical strategy for the identification of the hierarchical
relationships, the four possible situations in Table 1 can be
observed. When the genetic effect sizes at the two loci are both sig—
nificant, it infers to the substantial effects to the phenotype variation
simultaneously. In this setting, the genetic effect size on each individ—
ual locus takes significance within the interaction. On the other
hand, insignificance of the genetic effect size at both loci represents
a closer cooperative interaction effect. Even though no individual
genetic effect size is significant, the interaction between the two loci
makes a significant contribution to the variation of the target gene
expression. Finally, the situation, one significant genetic effect size
with an insignificant one, is of interest, since it clearly shows the
hierarchical relationships between the genes. When ‘A’ is epistatic to
‘B’ (also means that ‘A’ is a downstream gene of ‘B’), it can be
notated as ‘B’ d ‘A’. The notation describes the hierarchical relation—
ships that ‘B’ represses ‘A’ not to active ‘A’ in the wild type.
However, when ‘A’ is activated, the effect of ‘B’ is masked by ‘A’.
The interpretation gives an important information to infer the hier—
archy for functional dependencies between genes of genes. The pro—
cedure to infer the gene hierarchy order is brieﬂy illustrated in
Figure 3.

3 Experiment results

3.1 Simulation studies

The simulation studies were conducted to assess the performances of
GEM and Fisher’s model. A number of types of simulation data
were generated, based on the biological epistasis models in Figure 2.
We considered the 14 case studies in various models and parameters
to represent all potential epistatic situations as described in Table 2.
The case studies 1 and 2 describe the hierarchical relationship with
different extents in Model I, where locus 2 is epistatic to locus 1. On
the other hand, case studies 3 and 4 have significant genetic effect
sizes at both loci, but in reverse (degrading for locus 1/propagating
for locus 2). Case study 5 is equivalent to case studies 11 and 12
with different genetic effect sizes. The same settings were given in
Models II and IV. Note that the parameters, r1 and n, are identical
in Models III and IV.

Given the genetic effect sizes of two loci and the epistatic model
(Model I—Model IV) at each case study, SNP data at two loci (x1,xz)
of a hundred samples were randomly generated, where r1 and r2
were varied by adding the positively normally distributed random
variables ()N(0, 0.1))) to the given values in Table 2. In a similar
way, the parameters of the marginal effects [31 and [32 were ran—
domly chosen with the positively normally distributed random vari—
ables ()N(0, 1))). The intercept parameter ﬁg was ignored. The
corresponding gene expressions were derived from the models with
the noise by normal distributed noise. The random noise was gener—
ated by various signal—to—noise ratios (SNRs)—5 and 1.5. The gen—
etic effect size, which is close to 1, shows that the locus has no
effect, while a size that is close to 0 or bigger than 1 shows a large ef—
fect size of degradation or propagation to gene expression, respect—
ively (Fig. 2). Note that either r1 or Q of zero value in Table 2 does
not mean zero but a fraction less than one due to the addition of the
random variables.

We first compared P—values of the interaction term [312 on GEM
and Fisher’s model. A thousand replications were conducted for all

to the null hypothesis of the interaction term when SNR : 5 are de—
picted in Figure 4 (Supplementary Fig. S1 for SNR: 1.5 in the
Supplementary Material). The significantly higher negative logarith—
mic P—values of the interaction term on GEM than on Fisher’s model
were observed for all case studies (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig.
S1C). The result shows that GEM has higher chance to detect epista—
sis than Fisher’s model. Moreover, we examined the statistical as—
sessment of the epistasis findings. A null hypothesis, which consists
of only marginal effects without interaction effect, is rejected when

FDR over the case studies are 0.018 :r 0.0054 and 0.022 :r 0.0042, respectively. The incorrect rejection rate to the null hypothesis less than 3% is expected on the

proposed model when SNR : 5

0.01, 0.00, 0.89 and 0.48 in case studies 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 13, respect—
ively, when SNR:5 (Fig. 4B), and are 0.06, 0.06, 0.01, 0.01, 0.46
and 0.18 when SNR: 1.5 (Supplementary Fig. S1D). On the other
hand, GEM consistently detected almost all interactions across the
case studies when SNR:5. The slightly low reject rates in case
studies 1, 6, 12 and 14 were observed on GEM when SNR: 1.5.
However, they were still significantly higher than Fisher’s model
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). The observations clearly describe the
substantial lack of epistasis detection power on Fisher’s model, espe—
cially when the epistasis is involved in hierarchy relationship of
genes, and support the argument for the limited use of Fisher’s
model to represent biological model in practice.

The proposed statistical strategy for the determination of hier—
archical relationships were evaluated. When epistasis is detected in
the simulation study, the P—values of [3,1 and [3,2 in Equation (15)
were computed. Then, the significance of the individual genetic ef—
fect size of the two loci was determined with the significance level of
0.05. The reject rates of each locus are depicted in Figure 5A. Since
the effect size of locus 1 was set by around one in case studies 1 and
2, the low reject rates (~0) at locus 1 were observed in Figure 5A.
The reject rates of case studies 5, 10, and 11—14, which is set by the
same effect size in, are shown as fairly even.

False discovery rate (FDR) analysis was conducted to measure
the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected null hypotheses. The
simulation data for the FDR analysis was generated by taking into
account only marginal effects and noise (SNR:5) without inter—
action, i.e. [312 : 0. The incorrectly rejected interaction term on
GEM and Fisher’s model was considered as a false positive, and
FDR was computed by false positive/(true positive + false positive).
The FDRs of GEM (0.018 : 0.0054) and Fisher’s model
(0.022: 0.0042) on average were observed throughout the case

studies (Fig. 5B). A FDR of less than 3% at most is expected on
GEM.

3.2 Human brain data on schizophrenia

We applied the proposed GEM to human brain data of schizophre—
nia. Both SNP and gene expression data used in the preparation of
this experiment were acquired from the human prefrontal cortex of
39 patients with schizophrenia and 44 controls (Liu et 41]., 2010).
We removed SNPs with minor allele frequency less than 1% or in
linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.2 within 1 Mb).

The exhaustive search approach for a whole large—scale genome
study is very expensive. Moreover, this work rather focused on pro—
posing the GEM to detect complex eQTL epistasis and its optimiz—
ing solution. Thus, we finally selected 76 genes by biological
literature in this study. The 76 genes are widely reported major sus—
ceptible components of the pathways on schizophrenia such as
PIK3K/AKT, growth factors, adhesion/junctions, NMDA receptor,
glutamate—related, dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABA, circadian,
cytokines and oxidative stress (Carter, 2006). The genes are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. We also considered 35 698 SNPs located
within the regions of the selected 76 genes. Note that although up—
stream SNPs of the genes known as enhancers or promoters were
not considered in this study, the consideration of the enhancer and
promoter regions may provide a great benefit to discover epistasis in
regulatory regions.

A significance test (01 : 0.05) for detecting the epistasis effect
was performed. For each gene, the pairs of the SNPs located in the
corresponding gene and the gene expression were examined by the
proposed method. Among a total of 1 549 788 scans, 15 epistatic ef—
fects were found by the proposed method with a threshold

(1’2 > 0.7), which are listed in Table 3. In the table, the model indi—
cates the biological epistatic model used to define the kernel func—
tion. The latent epistatic properties of the genetic effects to the
quantitative phenotype can be deduced from the optimally estimated
model. It is noticeable that only one in the findings, rs1566368,
r51928042 —> GRIN2A, appears as significant by Fisher’s model
(see the third row in Table 3, where {70312)1 < 0.05). It represents
that compositional epistasis is much pervasive in genetic systems
and it has overlooked the inﬂuence with the statistical epistasis
studies.

The detailed epistatic effects of the two representative findings
are illustrated in Figure 6 (also see the first two rows in Table 3),
where the gene expressions of the contingency table at the genetic
mutants at two loci are described. The putative gene expressions on
epistasis estimated by the proposed method is colored in red, and
the sample mean and median values of the gene expressions are indi—
cated with blue and black lines, respectively, in the left figures. The
right figures show the latent epistatic effects of the model by remov—
ing the marginal effects for elucidating the genetic effects of the mu—
tation at the loci. As the first significant observation, the gene
expressions of GRID1 on double minor alleles of rs2324046 and
rs2876117 are depicted in Figure 6A. In the observation, no signifi—
cant marginal effect of both rs2324046 and rs2876117 appears, (i.e.
p(/)’1) : 0.939 > 0.05 and 17(02): 0.465 > 0.05), but significant
interaction effect (i.e. p(/)’12)I : 0.037). The fractional genetic effect
sizes (r1 : 0.03, r; : 0.09) indicate that the genetic mutants repress
the gene expression of GRID1 in a multiplicative fashion with
threshold. The epistatic phenomena are clearly observed in the right
figure in Figure 6A, where the gene is highly activated when no mu—
tant exists at both loci. This discovery reﬂects the two variants may
work together to regulate GRID1 expression. By the hierarchy test,
the effect of rs2876117 is observed as highly significant
(p(/)’,2) : 0.04) in the interaction. It shows the hierarchical relation—
ship between the two genetic mutants to the gene, which conse—
quently infers the gene hierarchy: BMP6 d GRM7 —> GRID1. As the
second significant observation, the gene expressions of HTR5A on
double mutants of rs2324046 and rs2876117 are depicted in Figure
6B. It also does not have marginal effects at both loci, but a

pressed gene expression on the mutants on r52876117 is
described with the fractional genetic effect size, 1’; : 0.16 and
p(/)’,2) : 0.05. The gene hierarchy of SNAP25 d SLC18A2 —>
HTR5A is inferred. SNAP25 inhibits (but not completely) the effect
of SLC18A2 at the wide type. However, the mutant of SNAP25 acti—
vates SLC18A2, which significantly affects the gene activation of
HTR5A.

We constructed a biological network from the set of the gene
hierarchies, as illustrated in Figure 7. The epistatic effects, in which
only one genetic effect size is significant to another by Equation
(15 ), were used for the construction, since the epistasis relationship
clearly provides a clue to infer the hierarchy between genes. The
genes are listed in the seven rows on top in Table 3. In Figure 7,
round rectangles represent epistatic eQTLs, circle nodes show the
genes which are regularized by the genetic effects. Hexagon nodes

represent the genes that have both genotypic epistatic effects and
phenotype variations of gene expression. For instance, ANK3 gene
is regularized by the two genotypic mutants of SLC18A2 and
CNTNAP2, and also ANK3 controls the gene expression of
GABRA1 with the genotypic variation of SLC18A2. Although the
network does not provide the full description of the gene regulatory
network or signaling pathway, the inferred gene hierarchies play an
important role in the enrichment of the biological network
inference.

To find the biological support of the constructed network,
extensive resources have been checked. There are only a few
eQTL—epistasis studies have done. One study addressed the relation—
ship between BMP6 and glutamine (Yabe et al., 2002). According to
the study, BMP6 plays an inductive role in the generation of cerebel—
lar granule cells (CGCs), and glutamate causes a reduction in
the ability of CGCs. In our findings, it appears that the genetic mu—
tant of GRM7 masks the effect of BMP6. Although we could not
make a direct connection between the findings at this time, we found
the apparent epistasis phenomena between the genes in the
experiment.

4 Conclusion

In this article, we proposed a novel GEM to detect the quantitatively
compositional epistasis as well as the statistical epistasis. Fisher’s
model has been commonly used to detect epistasis as a tool for the
statistical epistasis in many studies. However, many argue for the
limited usage of Fisher’s model due to the lack of the biological in—
terpretation. The proposed method is designed to provide a ﬂexible
tool that detects epistasis on various biological models. The individ—
ual genetic effect size on the interactive effect of the GEM enables
one to infer the hierarchical relationships between the genes. The
optimal solutions for best—fitted parameters to the data and the stat—
istical approach for identifying the hierarchical relationship are
provided.

To justify the lack of Fisher’s model and to assess the
proposed model, we conducted simulation studies designed with the
various epistatic settings. In the simulation studies, we showed
the epistatic situations that Fisher’s model lacks the ability to detect,
and the outstanding performance of the proposed model comparing
Fisher’s model. Furthermore, we applied the model to human brain
data on schizophrenia. The assessment with the real biological
data is not easy due to the lack of a well—known grounded truth.
However, the clear epistatic evidences are shown by the
significance test.

The expansion of the proposed method to the epistasis study
with more than two genes can be easily achieved in terms of a theory
by adding more terms to the model. However, the genetic inter—
action effects with more than two would make the epistasis very
complicated, and would need more biological putative scenarios.
Furthermore, the interpretation of the hierarchical relationship
would be challenging. Intensive future research is necessary for this
issue.

This exhaustive search approach is extremely expensive on a
whole large—scale genome study. However, it gives descriptional in—
formation of the epistatic model on multiple genes when certain de—
signed targeting genes are given. In this article, the total scanning of
the human brain data of schizophrenia between 35 698 SNPs and 76
genes (only susceptible genes) in the schizophrenia human brain
data experiment was completed in several minutes with the program
implemented by MATLAB on a personal computer. For the whole
large—scale genome study, the total search space will be (number of
SNPs) X (number of SNPs—1) X (number of genes)/2, i.e.
852 963(SNP) X 852 962(SNP—1)>< 25 833(Gene)/2, which is in—
tractable to investigate whole eQTL epistasis interactions. The im—
provements of its performance can be possible with parallel
computing and distributed systems as well as extending it to a semi—
exhaustive approach for future research.

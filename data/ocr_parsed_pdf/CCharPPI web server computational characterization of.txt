complexes of known affinity (Kastritis et al., 2011), with the
relationship between afﬁnity values and the pre—calculated de—
scriptor values indicated by a scatter plot. Two pre—calculated
datasets are available from the website. The first consists of the
structural afﬁnity benchmark (Kastritis et al., 2011), a set of 144
complexes with experimentally determined affinity. The second
consists of 157 wild—type complexes and 2731 unique mutations
in the SKEMPI database (Moal and Fernandez—Recio, 2012), as
modelled using FoldX (Guerois et al., 2002). Computational
time for calculating all descriptors is typically <5 min and took
<15 min for the largest complex tested (the FAB/inﬂuenza haem—
agglutinin, PDBid 2VIS). Calculations are quicker when exe—
cuted in parallel using the batch mode, with the 157 wild—type
and 2731 unique mutants in the SKEMPI set taking 18h to
complete, and the 144 complexes in the structural afﬁnity bench—
mark completing in 1h 20 min. The server has been tested on
major browser for MacOS, Ubuntu 12.4, Windows 7 and
Windows 8.

3 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have brought together many different methods
for characterizing proteiniprotein interactions, and provide pre—
calculated descriptors for two datasets, one of which is also used
to provide a visual comparison of uploaded complexes with com—
plexes of known afﬁnity. The ease with which these descriptors
can be calculated can accelerate the prototyping of reproducible
predictive models, allow users to mix and match different func—
tional forms to model physical phenomena, find new terms for
their scoring functions and characterize their complexes of inter—
est. For researchers interested in local execution or incorporation
into their own software, all scripts and code are available on
request. We intent to expand the pre—calculated datasets, as
well as the features as new methods become available.

Abstract

Summary: Although the R platform and the add—on packages of the Bioconductor project are
widely used in bioinformatics, the standard task of multiple sequence alignment has been neg—
lected so far. The msa package, for the first time, provides a unified R interface to the popular mul—
tiple sequence alignment algorithms ClustalW, ClustalOmega and MUSCLE. The package requires
no additional software and runs on all major platforms. Moreover, the msa package provides an R
interface to the powerful IATEX package TEXshade which allows for flexible and customizable plotting

of multiple sequence alignments.

Availability and implementation: msa is available via the Bioconductor project:
http://bioconductor.0rg/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html. Further information and the R code
0fthe example presented in this paper are available at http://www.bi0inf.jku.at/software/msa/.

1 Introduction

Multiple sequence alignment is one of the most fundamental tasks in
bioinformatics. It serves as the basis for the detection of homologous
regions, for detecting motifs and conserved regions, for detecting
structural building blocks, for constructing sequence profiles, and as
an important prerequisite for the construction of phylogenetic trees.
Since exact methods scale exponentially with the number of aligned
sequences, approximative methods have been introduced that try to
obtain decent, yet not necessarily optimal, alignments with reason-
able computational effort. ClustalW is a classic, but still very com-
monly used, method (Larkin et (11., 2007; Thompson et (11., 2004).
T-Coffee (Notredame et (11., 2000) and MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004a, b)
are other methods that are widely used. ClustalOmega (Sievers et
(11., 2011) is a more recent top-notch method that has been designed
to align large numbers of sequences in relatively short time. For a
more comprehensive overview of multiple sequence alignment meth-
ods, we refer to Wallace et a1. (2005), Edgar and Batzoglou (2006)
and Notredame (2007).

All methods mentioned above are available as command
line programs or via Web interfaces (e.g. on the EMBL-EBI server

http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/). However, for the R platform that
is widely used in bioinformatics, the possibilities to perform multiple
sequence alignment are limited. The Biostrings package (Pages
et (11., 2015), which is the standard package for sequence analysis
within the Bioconductor project, provides data structures for storing and
manipulating multiple sequence alignments, but not methods for com-
puting them. Only recently, the muscle package that provides a simple
interface to MUSCLE has been released via Bioconductor. For other
methods, users still need to resort to external stand-alone programs.

This article presents msa, an R package released as part of
Bioconductor 3.1 in April 2015. The package provides a unified
interface to the three most common multiple sequence alignment
methods and further integrates TEXshade (Beitz, 2000) for customiz-
able pretty printing of multiple sequence alignments.

2 Package description

2.1. Multiple sequence alignment

The msa package provides interfaces to the three multiple sequence
alignment methods namely ClustalW, ClustalOmega and MUSCLE.
All three are available as R functions with a unified interface. The

Abstract

Summary: A recent article identified an artifact in multiple single—cell RNA—seq (scRNA—seq) data—
sets generated by the Fluidigm C1 platform. Specifically, Leng et al. showed significantly increased
gene expression in cells captured from sites with small or large plate output IDs. We refer to this
artifact as an ordering effect (OE). Including OE genes in downstream analyses could lead to biased
results. To address this problem, we developed a statistical method and software called OEFinder
to identify a sorted list of OE genes. OEFinder is available as an R package along with user—friendly
graphical interface implementations which allows users to check for potential artifacts in scRNA—

seq data generated by the Fluidigm C1 platform.

1 Introduction

Single—cell RNA—seq (scRNA—seq) has led to important findings in
many fields and is becoming increasingly popular in studies of tran—
scriptome—wide expression (Deng et al., 2014; Leng et al., 2015;
Shalek et al., 2014; Trapnell et al., 2014; Treutlein et al., 2014). To
facilitate scRNA—seq, the majority of studies utilize the Fluidigm C1
platform for cell capture, reverse transcription and cDNA amplifica—
tion, as this platform allows for rapid and reliable isolation and pro—
cessing of individual cells. In spite of the advantages, Leng et al.
(2015 ) identified an artifact in multiple datasets generated by C1
and confirmed that the artifact was present in the cDNA processed
by the C1 machine. In particular, in these datasets, there are genes
showing higher expression in cells captured in specific capture sites.
These capture sites are the ones with small or large plate output IDs.
We refer to this artifact as an ordering effect (OE), which has been

shown to be independent of organism and laboratory (Leng et al.,
2015). As detailed in Leng et al. (2015), accurate identification of
OE genes is important to ensure unbiased downstream analyses.

Leng et al. (2015) used an ANOVA—based approach to detect
OE genes. The ANOVA—based approach performs well in many
cases, but has reduced power when few cells are available. (Note
that in empirical data, the cells can be missed owing to the random
effects of capture failure—an empty capture site, or doublets—cap—
turing more than one cells in one capture site.) To improve power
for identifying OE genes, we developed an approach, OEFinder,
based on orthogonal polynomial regression. Results show that
OEFinder is less sensitive to sample size and outperforms the
ANOVA—based approach when few cells are available.

OEFinder is implemented in R, a free and open source language,
with a vignette that provides working examples. The graphical user
interface (GUI) implementations of OEFinder allow users with little

OEFinder to identify OE genes in scRNAseq

computing background to easily identify and characterize OE genes
in scRNA—seq data (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S4).

2 Analysis input and output
2.1 Input

2.1. 1 Expression estimates

OEFinder requires a genes—by—cells expression matrix. The expres—
sion matrix can be either normalized or unnormalized. If the input
matrix is unnormalized, OEFinder applies the Median—by—Ratio nor—
malization method introduced by Anders and Huber (2010) prior to
OE detection.

2.1.2 Capture site group definitions

As detailed in Leng et al. (2015), the capture sites are labeled as
A01, . . . , A12, B01, . . . , B12,. . . , H01, . . . , H12. If the capture site
IDs are provided, OEFinder groups cells from sites with the same
starting letters. When the capture site information is not available,
OEFinder groups cells based on their input order. By default,
OEFinder groups cells into eight even—sized groups. The number of
groups may be changed by the user.

2.2 Method

The normalized expression values of each gene are scaled to z—
scores. For each gene, OEFinder applies an orthogonal polynomial
regression on z—scores against group code. To infer whether gene g
follows the OE trend, OEFinder calculates the P—value pg; of a one—
tailed test that tests whether the coefficient of the quadratic term is
positive. To account for the goodness of the spline fitting, OEFinder
defines an aggregate statistics Sg as —log(pg,2) — log(pm0del), in
which pmndel denotes the F test P—value of the full model. OEFinder
then generates 10 000 simulated genes from permuted data to evalu—
ate the significance of the observed aggregated statistics. By default,
genes with permutation P—value <0.01 are identified as OE genes.
The number of simulated genes and the P—value cutoff may
be changed by a user (for further details, see Supplementary
Section S2).

23 Output

2.3.1 List of OE genes

OEFinder outputs two.csv files — one contains a sorted list of OE
genes and the other contains p—values for all genes.

2.3.2 Expression matrix for downstream analysis

OEFinder outputs a normalized expression matrix that can be dir—
ectly input to downstream analyses. The user has the option to
choose either removal of the OE genes, or imputation of the OE
genes with adjusted values.

2.3.3 Visualization of OE genes

OEFinder generates a .pdf file contains expression plots of the top N
OE genes, where N is user specified. An example is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1.

3 Evaluations

3.1 Simulation studies

We conducted eight simulation studies to evaluate the performance
of the OE detection algorithms. In each simulation, we generated
5000 expressed genes with 500 OE genes. Expression of OE genes
was generated based on expression profiles of OE genes detected in
empirical data. (Details of the simulations may be found in
Supplementary Section S3.) The eight simulation studies evaluate
cases with varying numbers of available cells (20—90 cells). Each
simulation study contains 100 repeated simulations.

Figure 1b and c shows the true positive rate (TPR) and false posi—
tive rate (FDR) comparing the ANOVA—based method introduced in
Leng et al. (2015) and OEFinder. Results indicate that >60 cells are
available, both methods have TPR >90% while FDR is controlled
<10%. When fewer cells are available, OEFinder has a higher TPR
than the ANOVA—based approach and the FDR is still well con—
trolled. The improved power in OEFinder is likely because the poly—
nomial regression in OEFinder fits the OE trend more specifically
than the ANOVA—based approach. Additional simulation results
may be found in Supplementary Section S4.

3.2 Case studies

We applied OEFinder on two publicly available datasets with
capture site ID information. Trapnell et al. (2014) data and Leng
et al. (2015) data contain four and three experiments, respect—
ively. Figure 1d and 6 shows 187 and 451 OE genes identified in
the first experiment of each dataset. Genes detected by OEFinder
show a clear OE pattern. Results of other experiments may be
found in Supplementary Section S5.

4 Discussion

We developed an R package OEFinder which can robustly detect
OE genes in scRNA data generated by the Fluidigm C1 platform.
OEFinder provides user—friendly graphical interface implementa—
tions that facilitate use by investigators.

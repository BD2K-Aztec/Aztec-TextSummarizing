ABSTRACT

Motivation: A promising class of methods for large-scale population
genomic inference use the conditional sampling distribution (CSD),
which approximates the probability of sampling an individual with a
particular DNA sequence, given that a collection of sequences from
the population has already been observed. The CSD has a wide
range of applications, including imputing missing sequence data,
estimating recombination rates, inferring human colonization history
and identifying tracts of distinct ancestry in admixed populations.
Most well-used CSDs are based on hidden Markov models (HMMs).
Although computationally efficient in principle, methods resulting
from the common implementation of the relevant HMM techniques
remain intractable for large genomic datasets.

Results: To address this issue, a set of algorithmic improvements
for performing the exact HMM computation is introduced here,
by exploiting the particular structure of the CSD and typical
characteristics of genomic data. It is empirically demonstrated
that these improvements result in a speedup of several orders of
magnitude for large datasets and that the speedup continues to
increase with the number of sequences. The optimized algorithms
can be adopted in methods for various applications, including the
ones mentioned above and make previously impracticable analyses
possible.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the cost of genomic sequencing rapidly decreasing, there is
a growing need for statistical methodologies that can efﬁciently
accommodate genomic-scale data for many individuals while
accounting for complex patterns of variation (e.g. linkage
disequilibrium) caused by evolutionary processes such as mutation
and recombination. The applicable underlying statistical model is
the coalescent with recombination, which describes the distribution
of genealogical histories for a collection of individuals. Known
methods for inference under this model are generally intractable
at the genomic scale, so practicable methods must realize a balance

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

between computational efﬁciency and approximating key properties
of the coalescent with recombination. A promising Class of such
methods use the conditional sampling distribution (CSD).

A CSD approximates the probability (under the coalescent with
recombination) of sampling an individual with a particular DNA
sequence, given that a collection of sequences from the population
has already been observed. Intuitively, recombination partitions the
newly sampled sequence into segments, each of which is a copy of
the corresponding segment in a previously sampled sequence, with
imperfections introduced by mutation. For computational efﬁciency,
this construction is often cast as a hidden Markov model (HMM).
The hidden state at a site indicates the previously sampled sequence
being copied and the associated observed state the allele of the new
sample.

Even within this framework there are alternatives, as it is
possible to trade-off ﬁdelity to the underlying coalescent process
for computational efﬁciency. The CSD of Paul et al. (2011), for
example, is the most accurate but is a constant factor slower than
CSDs proposed by Fearnhead and Donnelly (2001) and by Li and
Stephens (2003), with the latter being the fastest, but least accurate.
CSDs for more complex models, incorporating gene conversion
(Gay et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2009), diploidy (Marchini et al., 2007),
demography (Davison et al., 2009; Hellenthal et al., 2008) and
admixture (Price et al., 2009; Sundquist et al., 2008), have also
been proposed.

Methods incorporating the CSD generally fall into one of several
categories. Likelihoods can be approximated using CSD-based
importance sampling (De Iorio and Grifﬁths, 2004a, b; Fearnhead
and Donnelly, 2001; Grifﬁths et al., 2008; Stephens and Donnelly,
2000) coupled with composite methods (Fearnhead and Donnelly,
2002; Hudson, 2001) or directly as a product of CSDs (Li and
Stephens, 2003). In conjunction with expectation—maximization or
Markov Chain Monte Carlo, these methods have been used for
estimation of ﬁne-scale recombination rates (Crawford et al., 2004;
Fearnhead and Smith, 2005; Li and Stephens, 2003; McVean et al.,
2004), gene conversion parameters (Gay et al., 2007; Yin et al.,
2009), population demography (Davison et al., 2009; Hellenthal
et al., 2008) and population structure (Lawson et al., 2012). It is
also possible to infer and use the hidden states in the HMM CSD
computation. This has been used for admixture inference (Price
et al., 2009; Sundquist et al., 2008; Wegmann et al., 2011), in
which genomic segments corresponding to ancestral populations are
identiﬁed and also within a pseudo-Gibbs sampling framework to
phase genotype sequence data into haplotype sequence data and to
impute missing data (Howie et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Marchini
et al., 2007; Stephens and Scheet, 2005).

Blockwise HMM computation

 

Nearly, all of these methods rely on iterative Monte Carlo
or expectation—maximization techniques. As a result, they are
computationally intensive, often requiring several hours, or, in some
cases, days, to produce a result, even for modest non-genomic
datasets (Howie et al., 2009); directly extending the methods to
large genomic datasets is thus often impractical. Moreover, nearly
all of the running time is expended on CSD computation, and so the
Choice of CSD is often made on the basis of efﬁciency and (arguably)
at the expense of accuracy (Browning and Browning, 2007; Howie
et al., 2009; Li and Stephens, 2003; Scheet and Stephens, 2006;
Stephens and Scheet, 2005).

In this article, we help to overcome these limitations by
proposing two related optimizations to the relevant HMM-based
CSD computations. Consider sampling a large number of sequences
from a population. If the sampled sequences are very long, it is likely
that nearly all of them will be unique. However, for most relatively
short regions, the number of unique subsequences will be reduced.
This intuition forms the basis of the ﬁrst optimization, which locally
reduces the complexity of the CSD computation, thereby improving
efﬁciency. The collection of locally unique subsequences on which
this optimization depends are formalized as a partition C of the
sampled sequences; we Characterize the optimal partition given the
sampled sequences and provide a fast algorithm for approximating
this optimum.

A second common feature of the sampled sequences is an
abundance of non-polymorphic sites. These sites are informative—
for example, a local over-abundance of non-polymorphic sites
indicates a recent common ancestor, which in turn indicates a
low propensity for recombination—and should be included in
the analysis. Indeed, Li and Durbin (2011) used the physical
distribution of polymorphic and non-polymorphic sites between
a pair of sequences to infer past population sizes of humans.
Using the fact that non-polymorphic sites do not differentiate the
sequences, we show that it is possible to reduce the complexity
of the CSD computation at non-polymorphic sites. We stress that
our solution is different from simply ignoring non-polymorphic
sites; we are proposing algorithmic improvements to incorporate
non-polymorphic sites into the analysis in an efﬁcient way.

In formally describing and evaluating our optimizations, we
restrict attention to the most accurate HMM-based CSD, ftSMC,
proposed by Paul et al. (2011) and consider the problem of
computing the conditional sampling probability (CSP), denoted
ﬁSMlen), of a particular individual a given a collection 11 of
previously sampled individuals. (Incidentally, in the case the size
n of the previously observed sample n is 1, the HMM underlying
ftSMC is equivalent to the HMM used in the aforementioned work
of Li and Durbin; we anticipate that ftSMC provides one way of
extending this line of work to many sequences). On simulated data,
our algorithmic improvement leads to a speedup of about 550><
for n=5000 previously sampled individuals; by making regularity
assumptions on mutation and recombination rates, this speedup
increases to about 1850>< . Importantly, we show that the empirically
observed speed-up increases with the number n of previously
sampled individuals.

Although we describe our optimizations in the context of
computing ftSMlen), they are more generally applicable. We
provide two sufﬁcient conditions for our optimizations and use them
to show the applicability to other HMM-based CSDs, including
those of Fearnhead and Donnelly (2001) and Li and Stephens

(2003), as well as CSDs for more complex demographic models and
population genetic HMMs. Also, in the Supplementary Material, we
describe extending our algorithms to allow for efﬁcient inference of
hidden states, often termed posterior decoding.

We stress that the work presented here is fundamentally different
from previous works on ‘approximating’ CSD-based population
genetic inference. Howie et al. (2009) consider a ﬁxed-size subset of
the haplotype conﬁguration 11, Chosen using a measure of ‘Closeness’
to the sampled haplotype a, in order to reduce the state space of the
HMM-based CSD and speed up computation. Similarly, Scheet and
Stephens (2006) and Browning and Browning (2007) consider an
HMM with reduced state space by compacting the conﬁguration
11 into a substantially smaller haplotype model. More recently,
Delaneau et al. (2012) have proposed an approximate HMM
formulation relying on a partition of the sampled sequences similar
to that proposed herein (Section 2.6). As described earlier, using such
heuristics improves computational efﬁciency, but ultimately at the
expense of accuracy. The purpose of this article is to provide highly
optimized ‘and exact’ computation for a large Class of approximate
CSDs, rather than to introduce additional approximations to the
underlying models.

2 METHODS

Herein, we describe the HMM formulation of ﬁSMC, the algorithms that are
currently being used to compute ﬁSMlen) and the optimizations we are
proposing to improve the running time.

We remark that the theoretical analysis of our algorithms is limited
to asymptotic time (and space) complexity. As a measure of real-world
performance, asymptotic analyses often leave much to be desired. Consider,
for example, a sample in which 1 out of every 1000 sites is polymorphic. If
we denote by k the total number of sites and k1) the number of polymorphic
sites, then formally 0(k) = 0(kp). Nevertheless, we would like to distinguish
between an algorithm that operates on each of the k sites and an algorithm
that operates only on the kp polymorphic sites, as the the latter will be some
1000>< faster; we thus write the complexities for the two algorithms as 0(k)
and 0(kp), respectively.

2.1 Notation

We consider haplotypes in the ﬁnite-locus ﬁnite-alleles setting. Throughout,
we suppose that there are k loci, and that recombination may occur between
any adjacent pair of loci (E, 6 +1) where 1 5 E < k.

The space of all such haplotypes is denoted by 7-1. and given a haplotype
h 6 7-1, the allele at locus E is denoted by h[E] and the sub-haplotype for arange
of loci E 5 E’ is denoted by h[E : E’]. A sample conﬁguration of haplotypes is
speciﬁed by a vector n=(nh)heH, with m, being the number of haplotypes
of type h in the sample. The set of ‘unique’ haplotypes associated with
conﬁguration n is denoted by 7-1“ = {h 6 7-1 : m, > 0}. Finally, the total number
of haplotypes is denoted by |n|=n, the number of unique haplotypes by
l7-tnl = nu and the number of polymorphic loci, which generally depends on
the sample n, by kp.

2.2 A brief description of ﬁSMC

Suppose that, conditioned on having already observed a haplotype
conﬁguration n, we wish to sample a new haplotype a. By generalizing the
technique of Grifﬁths at al. (2008) based on the diffusion process, Paul and
Song (2010) introduced the CSD ﬁps intended to approximate key properties
of the coalescent with recombination, the model under which inference is
to be performed. The central idea of ﬁps is to ﬁx the unknown ancestry of
n to be the ‘trunk genealogy” A*(n), in which lineages associated with the
haplotypes do not mutate, recombine, or coalesce with one another, but rather

events at each locus, and the corresponding absorption time (t(") and t0”)
and haplotype (h(") and h“), respectively), are indicated by horizontal lines

extend inﬁnitely into the past. Having ﬁxed the ancestry of n, a conditional
genealogy C associated with haplotype a is sampled; within C, lineages
evolve backwards in time subject to mutation, recombination, coalescence
and ‘absorption’ into one of the lineages Of A*(n). When every lineage of
C has been absorbed, the process terminates; the type of every lineage of C
is now determined and a sample for a is generated.

Although a recursion for computing the CSP ftp5(ot|n) is known, it is
computationally intractable for all but the smallest datasets. To remedy this
limitation, Paul et al. (2011) adopted a sequentially Markov framework
(McVean and Cardin, 2005) for the conditional genealogy C. The central
idea is to consider the ‘marginal’ conditional genealogy sg associated with
each locus E, which is described, disregarding mutation events, by the pair
sg=(tg,hg), where tg e[0,oo) is the absorption time and hg 67-1“ is the
absorption haplotype. The conditional genealogy C can thus be represented
as a sequence of marginal conditional genealogies {sg}. See Figure 1 for an
illustration.

In general, the random sequence of marginal conditional genealogies
is not Markov, due to the potential for coalescence events within the
conditional genealogy. Nonetheless, it is possible to ‘approximate’ this
sequence as Markov by using a two-locus transition distribution. Mutation
can then be realized at each locus independently as a Poisson process on
the marginal conditional genealogy, thereby generating a sample for a. The
resulting CSD is denoted by ftSMC. Paul et al. (2011) found that the Markov
approximation underlying erMC has minimal effect on accuracy compared
with ﬁps, coinciding with ﬁndings in similar domains (Marjoram and Wall,
2006; McVean and Cardin, 2005).

Owing to its Markov structure, the CSD time can be cast as an HMM
wherein the 6th hidden state is the marginal conditional genealogy sg =
(tg,hg) and the 6th observed state the conditionally sampled allele am]. In
order to use standard dynamic programming methodologies for inference,
the state space of the HMM must be ﬁnite, and so absorption time is
discretized by partitioning [0, 00) into a (possibly large) ﬁnite number m of
intervals I and considering an absorption interval, denoted by d5 61, rather
than an absorption time. The discretized hidden state at the 6th locus is
then sg = (dg,hg), and the initial, transition and emission distributions for the
discretized ﬁSMC HMM are denoted by {(-), ¢g(- | -) and §g(- | -), respectively.
Interested readers should consult Paul and Song (2010) and Paul et al. (2011)
for details.

2.3 Computation with ﬁSMC

The CSP ﬁSMlen) under the discrete-space HMM can be efﬁciently
computed using the ‘forward algorithm’, a dynamic program associated with

the HMM forward recursion:

ﬁSMcrain>=Z Z Flam). (1)
tie! he’Hn
where
Ftrd.h>=st(amld.h>z Z ¢t—1(d~hid/wh‘WZ—Nd‘wh‘l (2)
d/elh/E’Hn
with base case
Fo<d.h>=t(d.h>. (3)

Importantly, this recursion, and the associated dynamic program with time
complexity 0(k(num)2), is applicable to a general HMM. In the following,
we examine the transition and emission distributions more carefully and
obtain a series of reﬁned recursions and the associated dynamic programs.

2.4 Improving efﬁciency through the
transition distribution

Consider the description of time given above and more rigorously deﬁned
in Paul et al. (2011). If a recombination does not occur between loci
6—1 and B, then (a'g_1,hg_1)=(a'g,hg); moreover, if recombination does
occur, the absorbing haplotype hg is independent of hg_1 and uniformly
distributed. As a result, we have the following property (We remark that
Property 1 is a sufﬁcient, though not necessary, condition for the algorithmic
optimizations described in this and subsequent sections. For example, as
stated, the transition distribution imposes a uniform distribution on the
absorbing haplotype in the case of a recombination; in fact, the algorithms
can be generalized to accommodate an arbitrary distribution over haplotypes
that does not depend on a" or h’. In Section 4, we discuss the applicability
of these optimizations to more general (and more specialized) classes of
approximate CSDs.):

with base case n
F0(a’,h)=x(")- —h. (7)

Using these recursions, the dynamic program in Algorithm 1 can be used to
compute ftSMlen). Within the pseudocode description, the time complexity
of Lines 6, 7 and 8 are O(m), O(nu) and O(nu), respectively. As a result,
the time complexity of Lines 579, and for the algorithm as a whole, is
O(km(m + nu)). This represents a substantial improvement over the quadratic
dependence on nu in the naive forward algorithm for HMMs. This simple
optimization has already been generally adopted (Fearnhead and Donnelly,
2001; Li and Stephens, 2003; Paul et al., 2011) and serves as a baseline for
improvement.

2.5 Improving efﬁciency through the emission
distribution

The state of the erMC HMM at locus E is a tuple (dg,hg). However, the
emission probability of ot[[] is governed only by the time interval dz and the
allele hg[[]. As a result, the following property holds:

PROPERTY 2. Considera subset B C 7-1“ such that there exists an allele a with
h[[] :afor all h e 8. Then, for each absorption interval d e I, the emission
distribution §g(- |d, h) is identicalfor all h e B. We indicate thisfact by writing
§g(- |d, h) =§g(- |d, B)for all h e 8.

With this in mind, deﬁne a ‘partition’ C of the haplotype conﬁguration n to
be a collection of blocks of the form (8,6315), such that

0 For every (B,ES,EC)EC, there exists a sub-haplotype x such that
h[ES:Ee]:x for all heB.

0 For every haplotype h 6 7-1“ and 1 5 E 5 k, there exists ‘exactly’ one
(B,ES,EC)EC with heB and [S SE 5135.

For a given locus E, a conﬁguration partition C induces a partition of the
haplotypes 7-1“, denoted by Cg, and Property 2 applies to each 8 e Cg. In the
next sections, we present new sets of recursions and dynamic programming
algorithms valid for an arbitrary partition C. The computational complexity
of these algorithms will depend on C through two functions, namely \II(C)
and 9(C), deﬁned as follows: For locus 6, deﬁne draw) : |Cg |, the number of
blocks in Cg and deﬁne my (C) to be the total number of haplotypes in blocks
of the conﬁguration partition ‘ending’ at locus 6. Then,

k k
ww>=me>=Zmr
[:1 [:1

k
mC>=Zwt<C>= Z IBI-

[:1 (B,[s,[c)eC

In some cases, we are primarily concerned with polymorphic loci, and so
we deﬁne \Ilp(C) to be the analog of \II(C) summed over ‘only’ polymorphic
loci.

Finally, we deﬁne the trivial partition CT for haplotype conﬁguration n as
the partition containing a single block ({h},1,k) for each h EH“. Note that
\II(CT):k-nu and 9(CT):nu. See Figure 2 for an illustration of both CT
and two non-trivial conﬁguration partitions.

where n5 22,165 nh. Similarly, by induction and making use of equations
(6) and (9), it is possible to show that, for [S 56 SEE and h 68,

T[(d~B)=§[(Ollel|d78)'yyz'T[—1(d~B)~ (11)
for [S 5 E 5 [5, with base case Tgs_1(d,8)= 1.

For each block (8,6315) EC, we take advantage of equations (9) and (11)
to directly compute Qg(d,B) and Tg(d,B) at every locus [S 5 E 5 [5. At the
end of each block, when E : [5, the ﬁner-grain values Fig (d, h) are computed
for each h e B using equation (10), and subsequently used to compute initial
values for blocks beginning at locus E + 1. The associated dynamic program
to compute the CSP ftSMlen) is given in Algorithm 2.

Within Algorithm 2, the time complexity of Line 7 is O(m); of Line 8 is
O(tlfg(C)) and of Lines 9 and 10 is O(wg(C)). Thus, the time complexity of
Lines @11, and the dynamic program, is O(km2 +m(\Il(C) + Q(C))). Observe
that Algorithm 1 is a special case of Algorithm 2 for C :CT. Thus, if it is
possible to obtain a conﬁguration partition C for n such that \II(C)+Q(C)
is substantially less than \II(CT)+ 9(CT): knu +nu, our new algorithm may
be considerably faster than Algorithm 1; constructing such a conﬁguration
partition is the subject of Section 2.6.

2.5.2 The absence of polymorphism In many reasonable evolutionary
scenarios, a great many loci will not be polymorphic. Accommodating such
loci in the analysis is important and can be done efﬁciently making use of
Property 2. In particular, for a non-polymorphic locus Z, Property 2 applies
to the trivial set 8027-1“, and therefore the emission distribution can be
written §g(-|d,80):§g(-|d) and moreover, Qg(d,80): Qg(d).

Suppose consecutive loci  . . WE: are not polymorphic. Rewriting
equations (9) and (10) for block (Bolflg) yields, for 6:,“ 5 E 56:,

Qt(d>=st(a[eild>- [yZ‘ZQt_1(d>+Ut_1(d>]. (12)

and for 6:56:62“ and heBo:7-ln,

where Tg(d)= FIE/:5: Eg/(c>t[E‘]|d)-y:ti)_l and solves the recursion

T[(d)=§[((¥lelld)‘y2d_)1‘T[—1(d)v (14)

for E: 5 E 5 6:, with base case Tg:_1(d)= 1.

T[(de)=T[(d)‘T[:—1(dv8)- (16)

Algorithm 2 can be modiﬁed to accommodate such stretches of non-
polymorphic loci as a special case, making use of equations (12) and (14)
to directly compute the values of Qg(d) and Tg(d) at each non-polymorphic
locus E. If we then assume (without loss of generality) that each (8, ES, [5) E C
has [5 at a polymorphic locus, then at the ﬁnal non-polymorphic locus, for
which E 26:, equations (15) and (16) may be used to compute Qg(d, B) and
T5 (d , B) for each 8 E Cg. This modiﬁcation is detailed in Algorithm 3.

Within Algorithm 3, the time complexity of Lines 5 and 8 is 0(1),
of Line 7 is O(m+1lrg(C)+wg(C)) and of Line 10 is O(m). As a result,
the time complexity of Lines 2712, and of the dynamic program, is
O(km2 +m(\llp(C) + Q(C))). Relative to Algorithm 2, less computation needs
to be done for non-polymorphic loci; thus, in the typical case of many non-
polymorphic loci, this dynamic program will have a decreased running time.
For C : CT, the time complexity is O(km2 +kpmnu).

2.5.3 An optimizationfor non-polymorphic loci The key recursions (12)
and (14) for non-polymorphic loci can be written in matrix form as Qg :
85015 +Zg)Qg_1 and ’72 2853157754, where Qg and ’72 are m-dimensional
column vectors having dth entry Q5 (d) and T5 (d ), respectively; 85 and Jig are
(m X m)-dimensional diagonal matrices having (d X d)th entry a; (ot[[] |d) and
yYZ , respectively; and 25 is an (m X m)-dimensional matrix having (d ,d’ )th

dﬂd
entry z:_l ).

Now, suppose that the mutational model is symmetric and the mutation
rate constant for all loci. Then, 85 :8 does not depend on E, for all non-
polymorphic loci 6. Similarly, if the recombination rate between each pair
of loci is constant, then Jig : 3} and 25 :3 do not depend on 6. With these
assumptions, for 6:,“ 5 E 5 6:,

Q[ =6<y+Z>QH =(80?+Z))“‘:+‘ 91:4.
72 =8y72_1=(8y>“—“i‘+‘72:_1.

and the values of (8(3}+Z))’ and (Elly can be pro-computed (either
by eigenvalue decomposition or repeated multiplication) for a relevant

(17)

range of r-Values. Using this technique for explicitly computing only the
necessary values of Qg(d) and Tg(d), stretches of non-polymorphic loci can
be ‘analytically’ skipped.

The modiﬁed dynamic program associated with this optimization is given
in Algorithm 4. The time complexity of Line 4 is O(m) and of Line 6 is
O(m+1lrg(C)+wg(C)). Thus, the time complexity for the dynamic program
is O(kpm2 +m(\11p(C) + 9(0)».

This reﬁnement once again reduces the computation required for non-
polymorphic loci, and so we might expect substantial improvements in
performance over Algorithms 2 and 3. For the choice C:CT, the time
complexity is O(kpm(m+nu)). Note that the assumptions necessary for
Algorithm 4, namely a symmetric mutation model and uniform mutation
and recombination rates, can be relaxed, but at the expense of additional
pro-computation. For example, given non-uniform, but locally similar,
recombination rates, pro-computation might be performed for each of several
rates; each stretch of non-polymorphic loci could then use the pro-computed
values associated with the closest recombination rate.

2.6 A fast algorithm for conﬁguration partitions

In Section 2.5, we assumed a conﬁguration partition C to be speciﬁed and
showed that, for Algorithms 241, the time complexity depends on C through
the functions \II(C) (or \Ilp(C)) and 9(C) and more particularly their sum. It
is intuitively clear that a conﬁguration partition minimizing Q will maximize
\II (as in CT), and vice versa, and in general these quantities are inversely
related; minimizing a convex combination of these quantities is therefore
difﬁcult. In this section, we propose a fast and simple parametrized algorithm
for constructing reasonably good conﬁguration partitions.

Given a conﬁguration n, the algorithm proceeds sequentially over the loci:
initially, let [S : 1. Given ES, ﬁnd the largest polymorphic locus [e such that
[S 5 [e 5 k, and the number of unique sub-haplotypes between loci [S and [e
is at most some threshold parameter s. Then, for each unique sub-haplotype
x between [S and [5, group all h EH“ such that h[[S : [e] :x into the same

Fig. 3. Empirically observed running time of Algorithm 4 used to compute
ftSMlen), for a particular conﬁguration n and an arbitrary at E 7-1“. Several
values of s E (2, . . . , 500) were used, and each circle corresponds to aparticular
value of s. The curve of circles demonstrates the trade-off between small
\Ilp (small s-Values) and small 52 (large s-values). As predicted by the
asymptotic time complexity results, running time appears to depend linearly
on both \Ilp- and Q-values. and ﬁtting a linear model indicates the constant
associated with \Ilp is ~1.5 times greater than the constant associated with
$2. The conﬁguration n was generated using coalescent simulation for 500
individuals, each having 105 bi-allelic loci, using population-scaled mutation
rate 6 : 0.005 per locus and population-scaled recombination rate p : 0.001

loci and nu :324 unique haplotypes

block 8 and add (813,65) to the conﬁguration partition. Set [S :66 +1 and
repeat until locus k is reached. An example conﬁguration partition resulting
from this algorithm is shown in Figure 2c.

Applying this procedure to conﬁguration n with threshold parameter s
results in a conﬁguration partition which we denote CS. Observe that for
s: |7-lnl, we obtain CS:CT, which minimizes 9. On the other hand, for
s :2 (in the bi-allelic case), the algorithm produces a conﬁguration partition
that minimizes \Ilp. Intermediate values of s produce the intermediate results
that are of interest. In order to gauge the effect of different combinations
of \11p and Q on the running time, the CSP ftSMlen) was computed using
the conﬁguration partition C, for each of several values of s, and the times
recorded; the results are plotted in Figure 3. As our intuition suggested, the
running time depends substantially on the choice of C and, in accordance
with the asymptotic time complexity results depends linearly on both \11p and
9. Furthermore, as anticipated, the values of \11p and Q are inversely related.

By ﬁtting a linear model to the data, we can deduce the constants
associated with \11p and 52, which the asymptotic results cannot provide.
Although these constants will depend on the implementation and hardware,
their ratio should be relatively stable, and therefore informative for choosing
an optimal trade-off between \11p and Q. We ﬁnd that the constant associated
with \Ilp is ~1.5 times that associated with 52, suggesting that running time is
minimized for a choice of C that minimizes 1.5 - \Ilp(C) + 9(C). Furthermore,
making use of the above algorithm, we deﬁne

s* :argmin{1.5-WP(CV)+Q(CV)}i
S

and C":CS*. In practice the value s" is found using binary search and
determining C* is very fast. This deﬁnition will be used frequently in
Section 4, as C" (and the analogous result for Algorithm 1, using \11 in
place of \Ilp) provides a good, though not necessarily optimal, choice for C.

Recall that Algorithm 2 with C: CT is equivalent to Algorithm 1.

Algorithms 2—4 rely on a partition C of the conﬁguration 11. We have
Characterized optimal such partitions and proposed a simple and fast
method for constructing good partitions C=C* (Cf, Section 2.6).
For the sake of comparison, we also consider the trivial partition
C=CT. Relative to Algorithm 2, Algorithms 3 and 4 represent
successive improvements in efﬁciency for non-polymorphic loci.
In this section, we provide an empirical analysis of these algorithms
and demonstrate that our optimizations yield a substantial speedup.

The optimized algorithms, along with their asymptotic time
complexities, are summarized in Table 1. Intuitively, for a ﬁxed
number of haplotypes n, and assuming coarse homogeneity across
the genome, the runtimes of each of these algorithms should be linear
in the number of loci. We are interested in determining the constants
associated with this linear behaviour for each algorithm. Note,
however, that for the cases when C = CT, the time complexities do
not depend on n directly, but rather the number of unique haplotypes
nu. For a particular value of n, the quantity nu will increase with
the number of loci under consideration until nu=n; only at this
point do the runtimes become linear in the number of loci. A similar
argument can be made for a more general conﬁguration partition C.
In order to attain and analyse the linear behaviour for the modestly
sized conﬁgurations that are considered, we formally interpret even
non-unique haplotypes to be unique, thereby forcing nu =n.

We produce data using coalescent simulation: we assume a
symmetric 2-allele model and with population-scaled mutation
rate 6 =0.005 per locus and population-scaled recombination
rate p = 0.001 between each pair of adjacent loci. For each of
several values of n, we thus simulate an n-haplotype 2 X 105-
locus conﬁguration 11. We compute the partitions CT and C * and
subsequently record the running time of each algorithm in computing
time (aln), for an arbitrary haplotype at E Hn. Throughout, we use a
time discretization consisting of m = 16 intervals. The running times
are plotted, on a logarithmic scale, as a ﬁinction of n in Figure 4a
and 4b, for C = C T and C = C *, respectively.

From Figure 4a, for which C = C T, it is Clear that our reﬁnements
for non-polymorphic loci have practical beneﬁts, as Algorithms
3 and 4 perform substantially better than Algorithm 2. The
asymptotic results summarized in Table 1 suggest the running time
of Algorithm 4 is a factor of k / kp faster than Algorithm 2. This factor
is roughly reﬂected in the logarithmic plot of Figure 4a as a vertical
shift, with deviations occurring because kp increases (slowly) with
n. Similarly, as n increases, the asymptotic results indicate that
computation is dominated by the O(kpnm) term for both Algorithms
3 and 4; this is reﬂected in Figure 4a by a near identity in running
times for these algorithms for larger values of n.

Comparing Figure 4b to a, the beneﬁts of taking C = C *
can be observed. For each algorithm, this optimization improves

performance substantially, particularly as the number of haplotypes
n increases. Given the results for Algorithm 3 in particular, it is clear
that the key quantity \I’p(C)+§2(C), taken from Table 1, increases
more slowly with n for C =C* than for C =CT. Finally, as in the
previous case, the asymptotic results for general C indicate that
computation is dominated by the 0(m(\IJp (C )+ £2(C))) term for both
Algorithms 3 and 4; the associated convergence of running times
appears to be occurring in Figure 4b, though more slowly than in
Figure 4a; thus, Algorithm 4 is a practically useful alternative to
Algorithm 3, even for larger values of n.

Although general trends are clear from Figure 4, the logarithmic
scale makes it difﬁcult to appreciate the magnitude of the
effects of the optimizations. As mentioned earlier, assuming rough
homogeneity over the genome, the computation time increases
linearly with the number of loci. In Table 2, we summarize the
constant associated with this linear behaviour as the time required to
process 1 X 105 loci, along with the speedup relative to the baseline,
Algorithm 1. Observe that Algorithm 3, with C = C *, which can be
applied in complete generality, provides a speedup of 15X, 250><
and 546>< for conditional sample sizes 11: 100, 2000, and 5000,
respectively; and in most cases, Algorithm 4 can be applied, which

increases these speedups to 320><, 1300>< and 1845><. Importantly,
the speedup increases with the conditional sample size n.

4 DISCUSSION

We have presented a number of optimized algorithms for computing
the CSP ﬁSMlen). Our optimizations are based on two intuitive
observations: ﬁrst, the number of unique haplotypes in a genomic
sample is dramatically reduced within relatively short regions and
second, the large number of non-polymorphic loci in a genomic
sample, though informative, do not distinguish between haplotypes.
These observations are formalized and leveraged to reﬁne the
recursive equations for computing ﬁSMlen), yielding optimized,
yet exact, algorithms.

We have described our optimization algorithms in the context of
the HMM associated with the CSD ﬁSMC proposed by Paul et al.
(2011). It is natural to question whether similar optimizations are
applicable to related CSDs, such as those proposed by Fearnhead
and Donnelly (2001) and by Li and Stephens (2003). In Section 2,
we described two sufﬁcient conditions: Property 1, which stipulates
that, upon recombination, a new hidden haplotype is chosen
independently and uniformly at random and Property 2, which
stipulates that the emission distribution depends only on the allele
at the current locus of the hidden haplotype. The aforementioned
CSDs do satisfy both of these properties; in particular, stronger
forms of Property 1 hold for both CSDs, enabling additional
optimizations. We have not empirically analysed the resulting
optimized algorithms, but by considering the resulting asymptotic
time complexities, analogous to those in Table 1, we anticipate that
the speedups obtained will be qualitatively comparable to those
observed for Time, though the corresponding magnitudes are difﬁcult
to estimate.

It is also interesting to consider CSDs for more complex
demographic scenarios. A theoretically straightforward extension of
Time to variable population size, for example, will continue to satisfy
both Properties 1 and 2 and will therefore be amenable to very
similar optimizations. On the other hand, extension to structured
populations, populations that are divided into several demes between
which there is limited migration, will not satisfy Property 1 as
the new hidden haplotype chosen upon recombination depends on

the deme in which recombination occurs. Nonetheless, a relaxed
version of Property 1 will be satisﬁed along with Property 2, and we
anticipate analogous optimizations will be possible. The outcome is
similar if time is extended to conditionally sampling diploid, rather
than haploid, individuals.

Related optimizations may be possible in other contexts as well.
For example, Li and Durbin (201 1) make use of a population genetic
HMM which satisﬁes conditions that correspond to Properties 1 and
2 and is used to analyse genomic data. It is interesting to note that,
in order to make their method practicable, Li and Durbin consider
non-overlapping 100bp windows as their set of loci; using the
optimization detailed in this article may render such compromises
unnecessary. It is less clear whether our optimizations are applicable
to other population genetic HMMs, such as those considered by
Hobolth et al. (2007) and Dutheil et al. (2009); nonetheless, we
hope that our work will foster progress in this area.

We conclude by recalling that a broad range of population genetic
methods have been developed and will continue to be developed,
based on the CSD. These methods are generally computationally
intensive, and approximations are often made on the basis of
efﬁciency and at the expense of accuracy; with the advent of
inexpensive genomic sequencing, such computational problems will
be compounded. We have introduced several optimizations for
CSD computation that can potentially speed up this computation
by several orders of magnitude without introducing additional
approximations. We believe that these optimizations will enable
analyses that were previously impracticable, particularly for large
genomic datasets. We also hope that the optimizations will
encourage more accurate methods, and in particular more accurate
CSDs, to be developed and used for population genomic inference.

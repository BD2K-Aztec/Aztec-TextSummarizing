ABSTRACT

Motivation: The discovery of new protein folds is a relatively rare
occurrence even as the rate of protein structure determination
increases. This rarity reinforces the concept of folds as reusable units
of structure and function shared by diverse proteins. If the folding
mechanism of proteins is largely determined by their topology, then
the folding pathways of members of existing folds could encompass
the full set used by globular protein domains.

Results: We have used recent versions of three common protein
domain dictionaries (SCOP, OATH and Dali) to generate a consensus
domain dictionary (ODD). Surprisingly, 40% of the metafolds in
the ODD are not composed of autonomous structural domains,
i.e. they are not plausible independent folding units. This finding
has serious ramifications for bioinformatics studies mining these
domain dictionaries for globular protein properties. However, our
main purpose in deriving this ODD was to generate an updated ODD
to choose targets for MD simulation as part of our dynameomics
effort, which aims to simulate the native and unfolding pathways of
representatives of all globular protein consensus folds (metafolds).
Consequently, we also compiled a list of representative protein
targets of each metafold in the ODD.

1 INTRODUCTION

Structurally similar proteins need not share signiﬁcant sequence
identity. The early observation of structurally and functionally
similar proteins (such as hemoglobin and myoglobin) led to the
partition of different sets of structurally similar proteins into folds
(Kendrew et (11., 1960; Perutz et (11., 1960). However, as more
structures were determined and more folds discovered, it became
clear that not all members of a fold were necessarily linked by a
common function (Nagano et (11., 2002). Also, the determination
of structures with conserved structural cores surrounded by variable
regions complicated the Classiﬁcation of new structures into existing
folds. Different approaches to resolving this heterogeneity of fold
Classiﬁcation have been reviewed elsewhere (Schaeffer et (11., 2010).
What degree of structural variation is tolerable between a domain

and a potential cousin before they no longer can be considered to
belong to the same fold?

The inconsistencies of analyzing and generating protein domain
dictionaries are one component of the vigorous discussion
surrounding the properties of protein ‘fold space’ (Csaba et (11.,
2009; Pascual-Garcia et (11., 2009; Sam et (11., 2006). Distinct
folds can contain regions of shared structural similarity (Grishin,
2001). Folds are both populated to different degrees and structurally
heterogeneous (Coulson and Moult, 2002; Majumdar et (11., 2009;
Wolf et (11., 2000). This heterogeneity complicates estimates of the
size and ‘shape’ of fold space, and is likely responsible for the wide
range of the estimated number of protein folds. The presence of
unclear domain boundaries in regions of fold space has led some to
question the utility of a hierarchical deﬁnition (Kolodny et (11., 2006).
Furthermore, fold assignment is also dependent on the problem of
domain detection (Holland et (11., 2006; Majumdar et (11., 2009).

The gold standards among domain dictionaries, SCOP (Structural
Classiﬁcation of Proteins; Murzin et (11., 1995) and CATH (Class,
Architecture, Topology, Homology; Orengo et (11., 1997), have been
the subject of many detailed comparisons (Day et (11., 2003; Hadley
and Jones, 1999; Jefferson et (11., 2008; Pascual-Garcia et (11., 2009;
Veretnik et (11., 1997). In general, both dictionaries weigh potential
functional and evolutionary relationships between fold members
with different strengths at different levels of their hierarchies. The
presence of shared fragments between differing folds and/or regions
of ‘Conserved’ structure have been well documented and are one
reason for the development of different empirical Classiﬁcation
methodologies, as more knowledge of protein structural evolution
emerges, hope remains that an evolutionary Classiﬁcation will be
derived (Valas et (11., 2009). In their early formulations, these
domain dictionaries represented different design methodologies.
Whereas SCOP was hand curated by experts, CATH was maintained
by a combination of automated process and expert curation.
However, SCOP has assumed more automated preclassiﬁcation
of new structures in response to the increasing rate of structure
determination, diluting this methodological distinction (Andreeva
et (11., 2008).

Although individual domain dictionaries may contain their
own biases, we can minimize the effect of those differences by
extracting a consensus from a group of such dictionaries. We
previously demonstrated the application of this method to SCOP,
CATH and the Dali Domain Dictionary (Dietmann et (11., 2001)
to generate a consensus domain dictionary (CDD 2003 version,
V2003) (Day et (11., 2003). This domain dictionary was the basis of
our initial high-throughput survey of native dynamics (Beck et (11.,
2008). Additionally, the concept of the metafold that we introduced
in the V2003 CDD was further developed in a study of ‘Cradle-loop’

structures (Alva et (11., 2008). A subset of the representative domains
from our V2003 CDD was used to conduct benchmark simulations
of molecular dynamics (MD) force ﬁelds (Rueda et (11., 2007).

Here, we present an updated CDD (V2009) derived using recent
versions of the input domain dictionaries, which incorporate many
new structures determined since the V2003 CDD was created.
The CDD is the backbone of our high-throughput MD initiative,
dynameomics (Beck et (11., 2008; van der Kamp et (11., 2010).
This project seeks to simulate the native and unfolding behavior
of representatives of all protein folds. Consequently, we need an
objective basis for selection of simulation targets. Therefore, it is
important that the CDD be monitored so that we can identify novel
topologies as they are classiﬁed and observe potential splits within,
and mergers between, our metafolds as classiﬁcations shift. It is
important that we identify domains that appear to be autonomous
units, since we use the contents of the CDD as potential targets for
simulation of folding/unfolding pathways. The selection process was
complicated by the discovery that roughly a third of the consensus
folds (metafolds) in the CDD are not autonomous structural units,
but instead are dependent components of multi-domain or complex
structures (or are small structural motifs).

Here, we present our data model for representing domains and
their metafolds over time in a relational database (Simms et (11.,
2008). We discuss the use of this data model to map domains and
their annotations from older versions of our dictionary to the newer
one (V2003 —> V2009). We present the full V2009 CDD consisting
of 1695 metafolds. We then ﬁlter the set to remove metafolds
that do not represent autonomous units or cannot be simulated for
other reasons, which yields 807 metafolds. In addition to being
of use to our dynameomics efforts, the ﬁltered 807 target list is
more appropriate for bioinformatics studies investigating globular
protein properties than the full CDD or the three parent domain
dictionaries by removing folds that do not represent autonomous
folded structures.

2 METHODS

2.1 Relational model for consensus set data

The relational schema for the ‘Target Selection and Preparation” (or ‘Prep’)
database. which houses our CDD. is shown in Figure 1 in a universal markup
language representation (Simms et al.. 2008). Consensus domains are stored
in the Domain table consisting of an identiﬁer. PDB code and fold identiﬁers
from the SCOP. CATH and Dali domain dictionaries. A domain must contain
fold identiﬁers from at least two of the three input domain dictionaries.
Metafold data are stored in the Fold table. which contains a metafold
identiﬁer. name and the metafold’s rank (based on domain population). Note
that the Fold table is. in fact. a table of metafolds. There may be multiple
versions of the same domain in the Domain table (due to multiple CDD
versions). and these differing versions may link to multiple metafolds (also
due to multiple CDD versions). The many-to-many relationship between
Fold and Domain is implemented Via the Fold_Domain table. Metafold
representatives chosen for simulation are captured in the Target table.

As previously stated. domain classiﬁcations evolve over time. which can
cause changes in the CDD. To capture these changes. the Fold. Fold_Domain.
Domain and Target tables include a consensus set identiﬁer to allow multiple
versions of metafold and domain deﬁnitions to be stored in the same
primary tables. To facilitate cross-consensus set queries. fold identiﬁers are
maintained across consensus set releases where this is meaningful. It is
possible for new identiﬁers to be introduced and existing identiﬁers to be
removed in subsequent releases.

Domains and targets are both linked to external data sources. The Domain
table contains a ﬁeld for the PDB code. and we populate a local cache table
(PDB) with speciﬁc information synthesized from a given structure’s PDBml
(Westbrook et al.. 2005). Examples include a structure title. dates. methods
and source organism. These ﬁelds facilitate local searches and analysis. The
Target_Simulation table links targets in the Prep database to simulations
contained in the dynameomics data warehouse (Simms et al.. 2008).

2.2 Generation of the V2009 CDD

The V2009 CDD was generated as described by Day at al. (2003). To generate
the CDD. we integrate recent versions of three major domain dictionaries:
SCOP (Andreeva et al. . 2008). CATH (Cuff et al.. 2009). and Dali (Dietmann
et al.. 2001). SCOP V1.73. CATH V3.2 and a March 2005 download of the
Dali Domain Dictionary were used as input for consensus generation. CDD
generation is a two-step process: First. consensus domains are generated by
pairwise comparison between domain dictionaries of residue ranges from the
same chain. Where a signiﬁcant overlap between input domains is detected.
a consensus domain is assigned. Second. the set of consensus domains is
ﬁltered for sequence similarity and then clustered into a set of metafolds
based on their composite fold identiﬁers. The set of consensus domains and
metafolds comprise our CDD. The workﬂow of this process is outlined in
Figure 2.

Our domain matching procedure follows the criteria speciﬁed by
Dietmann and Holm (2001). A given domain in one input dictionary is
compared against analogous domains in the other domain dictionaries. Where
the given domain and an analogous domain both overlap to a signiﬁcant
extent (80%) a consensus domain pair is assigned. If a given domain matches
domains from both other input dictionaries. the three resulting domain pairs
are collapsed into a single consensus domain spanning analogous domains

from all three input dictionaries. If a domain from any single domain
dictionary has no consensus with any domain from either of the remaining
domain dictionaries. it is discarded. Each consensus domain preserves the
source data from its input dictionaries (PDB. chain. residue range and fold
identiﬁer). This list is loaded into our database to assist with metafold
representative selection and report generation. The schema is illustrated in
Figure 1.

The full domain list is ﬁltered by sequence using the SCOP ASTRAL95
sequence-ﬁltered domain list and the CATH ‘SOLID’ sequence identiﬁers
(Chandonia et al.. 2004; Greene et al.. 2007). The non-redundant domain
list produced by the sequence ﬁlter is used as the basis for generation of
metafolds. Each domain contains a composite fold identiﬁer derived from
its input domain deﬁnitions. SCOP and CATH are hierarchal classiﬁcations.
for SCOP we chose the ‘Fold’ level to cluster. for CATH we chose the
‘Topology’ level. Domains whose composite fold identiﬁers share two of
three elements are clustered together into a metafold.

2.3 Mapping between CDD versions

The CDD is a product of clustering across input domain dictionaries. As
these input dictionaries change with the release of new versions. so should
the CDD. However. without a detailed description of the changes made. it can
be difﬁcult to assign equivalence between two domains from CDDs generated
from different inputs. A mapping between the V2003 and V2009 CDD was
generated based on domain identiﬁer and fold identiﬁer equivalence (Fig. 3).
Changes in fold representation in new versions of both CATH and Dali
motivated the mapping criteria. Between the release of CATH V2.4 and V3.0.
‘working’ CATH classes [$9] were no longer included in production releases
(Greene et al.. 2007). Since the V2003 CDD included these classes. criteria
were chosen such that V2003 domains could be reassigned to regular (14)
CATH classes. Since fold identiﬁers do not persist between V3.1 )3 and the
March 2005 version of Dali. identity between these versions could not be
used as the basis for a mapping. In the period of time since we acquired this
version of Dali. this domain dictionary has been discontinued (Holm et al..
2008).

Four mapping criteria were deﬁned based on the mapping classiﬁcation a
domain possessed in the V2003 CDD. A V2003 domain possessing composite
SCOP. CATH and Dali fold identiﬁers is mapped to a V2009 domain if both
the SCOP and CATH composite chain and domain (PDB6) and the V2009

V2009 CDD

Dali PDB6 is deﬁned (though not necessarily equivalent). A V2003 domain
possessing only SCOP and CATH fold identiﬁers is mapped to a V2009
domain if both the SCOP PDB6 identiﬁer and CATH PDB6 identiﬁer are
equivalent. A V2003 domain possessing only CATH and Dali fold identiﬁers
is mapped to a V2009 domain if the CATH PDB6 and fold identiﬁers are
equivalent and the Dali fold identiﬁer and PDB6 is deﬁned. A V2003 domain
possessing only SCOP and Dali identiﬁers is mapped to a V2009 domain if
the SCOP PDB6 and fold identiﬁers are equivalent and the Dali fold identiﬁer
and PDB6 is deﬁned.

2.4 Selection of domains as metafold representatives

Mapped metafolds are sorted and ranked by their non-redundant population
(Fig. 4). We examined domains within each metafold to assess their
suitability as a simulation target. We chose targets that were self-contained
domains in a single protein chain that were less than 450 residues in length.
Where the structure was determined by X-ray crystallography. we only chose
crystal structures with resolutions higher than 3.0 A. Domains with obligate
cofactors (other than an‘l'. Ca2+ and heme) were rejected. Also. domains
with multiple Zn2+ . Ca2+ and heme sites were rejected. with a few exceptions
(e.g. calbindin). Many of the domains rejected for this reason are chains
where the cofactor is a major structural element. Domains with a single
an‘l'. Ca2+ or heme were selected (i.e. myoglobin) regardless of whether
folding information was available regarding the role of the cofactor. These
particular cofactors and proteins were included because they have been the
subject of numerous biophysical. biochemical and folding studies. When
multiple domains within a metafold met our selection criteria. we preferred
domains with biomedical relevance or with experimental folding studies
available for comparison. The workﬂow for target selection where targets
exist from a previous CDD is outlined in Figure 3.

The determination of whether a given domain was self-contained was
primarily determined by manual inspection. Several factors could lead to
the rejection of a domain as not self-contained; these factors could occur
either in isolation or in concert with one another. Where a domain was a
component of a multi-domain structure. we used a simple ‘sheet of paper”
test to determine whether there was a clean interface between the domain

of interest and the rest of the protein. Where a domain could not be cleanly
separated from the remainder of the protein. it was rejected because of its
convoluted interface. In addition. we examined the proposed biological unit

crystal contacts were rejected. Furthermore. structures that were ‘irregular’
(those that possessed little to no structure or hydrophobic core) could also
be rejected for being not self-contained. This range of factors led to a broad
spectrum of possible buried surface area in rejected metafolds (1076O%).
Furthermore. where the domain boundary occurred in the middle of a
signiﬁcant secondary structure element (helix or beta sheet). this disruption
could be used as a reason for rejection as not self-contained. This was not used
as a basis for rejection where the secondary structure was a linking region
and could be safely truncated to the previous loop region and where that
truncation would not expose signiﬁcant hydrophobic surface area. Examples
of non-autonomous domains are presented in Figure 5.

Where a single suitable domain was selected as a target for simulation
it was designated a representative for its metafold. If. after examining
all domains within a metafold. a suitable domain could not be found. a
domain was chosen as a fold representative and the reasons for its rejection
were annotated. Once a domain was selected as a metafold representative.
we chose a residue range to simulate that incorporated the input domain
deﬁnitions such that we avoided disrupting secondary structure elements
while removing long. unstructured tails (many of which are cloning artifacts).
The distribution by rank of rejected and accepted metafolds is illustrated in
Figure 4E.

3 RESULTS
3.1 V2009 CDD

The CDD consists of a set of consensus domains and a list of
consensus fold identiﬁers binding these domains together into
metafolds (Fig. 2). Consensus domains were identiﬁed between pairs
of domain dictionaries (SCOP/CATH, SCOP/DALI, Dali/CATH).
Summary statistics from each of the domain dictionaries are
presented in Table 1. The agreement between domain dictionaries
was measured as the fraction of shared consensus domains divided
by the total number of domains originating from structures shared
between the two dictionaries.

We reduced the effect of differing release dates (and thus different
numbers of structures) by considering only shared structures. CATH
and Dali have the highest agreement, with 96% of CATH domains
and 90% of Dali domains included in the CATH/Dali consensus
domain set. SCOP and CATH have the next highest agreement,
with 79% of SCOP domains and 82% of CATH domains in the
SCOP domains in the SCOP/CATH consensus domain set. Finally,
SCOP and Dali had the lowest agreement, with 65% of SCOP
domains and 61% of Dali domains included in the SCOP/Dali
consensus domain set. A consensus domain need not exist solely

between a single pair of domain dictionaries. Where a consensus
domain was determined by each of the three pairwise comparisons,
it was collapsed into a single triple consensus domain in the CDD.
Thus, four classes of consensus domains were created, SCOP/CATH,
SCOP/Dali, Dali/CATH and SCOP/CATH/Dali.

The V2009 CDD is composed of 80062 domains, originating
from 27 140 PDB structures. The total number of PDB structures
considered is lower than the structures available due to the lag
between PDB and domain dictionary releases. The domains of the
CDD were distributed among the aforementioned classes as follows:
51% SCOP/CATH/Dali, 30% SCOP/CATH, 10% CATH/Dali and
9% Dali/CATH. To generate the metafold list, the CDD was ﬁrst
ﬁltered by sequence identity (Fig. 2). The anDD was composed
of 13 345 domains. The domains in the CDD clustered into 1695
metafolds. On the whole, these metafolds incorporate 4217 unique
consensus fold identiﬁers derived from 971 unique SCOP folds,
923 unique CATH topologies and 2362 Dali folds. The distribution
of domains per fold for the input domain dictionaries is shown in
Figure 4A and B.

3.2 Comparison of V2009 and V2003 CDDs

Both the residue range of a domain and its fold classiﬁcation
can change over time. These changes affect the output of the
metafold clustering and the domain contents of the CDD. Since
our dynameomics simulations are indexed against the CDD, it is
necessary to track domains across multiple dictionary versions so
that information about our simulated domains is current. Where
possible, we generated a map between domains in our V2003 and
V2009 CDD based on their fold identiﬁers. There were 31141
domains in the V2003 CDD. From this dictionary, 4693 domains
could not be mapped forward from V2003 to V2009 and are
considered obsolete (discussed below). From V2003 to V2009,
26448 domains were mapped. There are 53614 new domains in
the V2009 dictionary that are not in the V2003 dictionary.

The domains that were not mapped from the V2003 CDD can be
broadly partitioned into three categories: (i) domains from structures
that were dropped from consideration in one of the input domain
dictionaries, (ii) domains whose boundaries changed signiﬁcantly
in one of the input domain dictionaries and (iii) domains that were
split into multiple domains or merged into a single domain. From
each of our input dictionaries used in V2003 CDD, 95% of the
structures considered also had at least one domain in the input
dictionaries used in the V2009 CDD. The ~5% of structures that

were in the V2003 CDD but not in the V2009 CDD had the following
properties: the structure was deemed obsolete by the PDB, the
structure consisted primarily of nucleic acids or the structure was
a purely computational model. Of those chains that were removed
from consideration that were not part of the aforementioned dropped
structure set, the majority are rare cases arising from the presence
of synthetic linkers and/or multi-chain domains arising from Viral
capsid structures. In some cases where neither the chain nor structure
containing a domain was dropped, but it could still not be mapped,
the domain boundaries in the structure were signiﬁcantly altered.
Alternatively a domain was split into multiple domains or merged
with other domains. Although we can observe these transitions, we
prefer to treat the resulting domain(s) as new. The 4393 dropped
domains from the V2003 —> V2009 CDD mapping originated from
2198 PDB structures. Of those V2003 domains, 3314 originate from
PDB structures that still contain domains in the V2009 CDD. There
are 1379 V2003 domains originating from 608 PDB structures not
found in the V2009 CDD. Of these V2003 domains, 319 originate
from structures that were superseded by newer structures in the PDB.
The remaining 1060 domains are dropped either because they were
removed from one of the input dictionaries, or because the domain
deﬁnition was changed in one or more of the input dictionaries,
breaking the original V2003 consensus.

Domains that were mapped from V2003 to V2009 met speciﬁc
criteria for their particular class (SCOP/CATH, SCOP/Dali, etC.).
Of the 26 448 mapped domains, 15735 were mapped using the
SCOP/CATH/Dali class, 7736 were mapped using the SCOP/CATH
class, 1734 were mapped using the SCOP/Dali class and 995 were
mapped using the CATH/Dali class. A majority of the domains
in our CDD could be mapped based on their SCOP and CATH
identiﬁers alone. The mapped domains originated from 11 896 PDB
structures, leading to an average of 2.23 mapped domains per PDB
structure. The mapped domains originate from 857 metafolds in the
V2003 CDD and are mapped into 719 metafolds in the V2009 CDD,
indicating that some V2003 metafolds and their domain contents
were merged into larger V2009 metafolds. Many domains were
also folded into larger metafolds as they gained a third input fold
identiﬁer. The 6613 mapped domains with deﬁned SCOP, CATH
and Dali domain identiﬁers in the V2009 CDD contained only 2-fold
identiﬁers in the V2003 CDD.

‘New’ domains are those that exist in the V2009 CDD and did not
exist in the V2003 CDD. The 53 614 new domains originate from
17 949 PDB structures. These new domains fall into 1565 metafolds.
There were 976 metafolds in the V2009 CDD that consisted entirely
of new domains, 589 metafolds composed of a mix of mapped and
new domains and 130 metafolds that consist entirely of mapped
domains. A majority of the new V2009 domains were placed into
metafolds with other mapped domains. The 8401 V2009 domains
fell into metafolds composed solely of new domains. The domain
population was less than ﬁve for 633 of the new V2009 metafolds.
The drop off in population with increasing rank and the large number
of singleton folds is shown in Figure 4C, which leads to greater
coverage of fold space for the top-ranked folds and limited additional
coverage provided by the low-populated high ranks (Fig. 4D).

metafold. We examined the location of input folds from SCOP and
CATH within the CDD closely because it indirectly addresses the
continuity of fold space. This analysis also serves as an internal
check of the consistency of our metafold clustering method. The
domains of an input fold can be distributed into multiple metafolds
and/or combined into a metafold with domains from other input
folds. To quantify this effect, we analyzed the number of metafolds
into which an input fold and its domains are distributed. An input fold
can be distributed over many metafolds and yet the vast majority of
that fold’s domains can still be assigned to a single metafold. Thus,
we are primarily interested in the fractional domain population of
the metafold containing the majority of an input fold’s domains, or
the ‘most populated metafold’. The net effect of this treatment is that
outliers within a fold are partitioned into their own poorly populated
or singleton metafolds (metafolds containing only a single domain).

Certain structurally variable topologies (such as the Rossmann
folds) are split more evenly across a number of metafolds. The 860
input SCOP folds were spread over 815 CDD metafolds. Of these
metafolds, 12 contained multiple SCOP input folds. The metafold
containing the most SCOP input folds was metafold #2 (consisting of
a number of Rossmann folds), followed by metafold #16 (consisting
of parallel (ii-helical bundles), and metafold #1 (consisting of IgG-
like 0-sandwiches). These SCOP folds are bound together by highly
populated CATH topologies. A full listing of merged SCOP folds is
provided in Supplementary Table S1. The 815 metafolds contained
only a single SCOP fold. Of these 815 metafolds, 290 also contained
only a single non-redundant domain. We also examined those SCOP
folds where the most populated metafold contained a diminished
fraction of the total domains, indicating that the SCOP fold was
distributed across multiple metafolds. Of the input SCOP folds, 112
had a fractional population within the most populated metafold of
380%. The signiﬁcance of this fraction can vary, however, if the
input fold is poorly populated or if the input fold was not a child of
one of the four main structural classes (all-01, all-0, 01 +0 or 01/0).

The 892 input CATH folds were distributed over 862 metafolds.
Twenty-six metafolds contained domains from multiple CATH folds.
The most populated metafold, consisting of IgG-like 0-sandwiches,
contained four CATH folds. Metafolds #16 and #46 contained three
CATH folds. The remaining 23 metafolds each contained two CATH
folds. The most populated metafold of the 30 most populated CATH
folds is presented in Supplementary Table S2. Of the 866 metafolds
containing only a single CATH fold, 277 also contained only a single
non-redundant domain, signifying singleton metafolds. The CATH
Rossmann fold (3.40.50) was the most populated of the CATH folds
that were signiﬁcantly distributed over multiple metafolds. This fold
was distributed over 42 metafolds, and the most populated metafold
of these (#2) contained only 49% of the input fold.

The V2009 CDD has 881 unique SCOP folds from the 11
different SCOP classes (all-01, all-0, 01+ 0, 01/0, multidomain 01 and
0, membrane and cell surface, small proteins, coiled coil, low
resolution, peptides and designed) There were 434 SCOP folds that
only appeared in metafolds with a simulated metafold representative
and 332 SCOP folds that were only found in rejected metafolds. The
rejected SCOP folds represent about a third of the folds from each of
the top four classes (all-01, all-0, 01+0 and 01/0) found in our CDD,
between 27 and 38% of each class. We rejected ~70% of each of
the multidomain and membrane classes in our set. Similarly, there
are 894 CATH topologies in our domain dictionary from the four
CATH classes: mainly-01, mainly-0, mixed Ol— 13 and irregular/few

secondary structures. The majority (77%) of the irregular class
CATH topologies are only found in rejected metafolds. The other
three CATH classes all had between 36 and 47% of topologies found
only in rejected metafolds. These classes had a similar number of
topologies found only in selected metafolds (40—55%). This analysis
of the SCOP and CATH folds reveals that we have not biased our
set of selected metafolds toward any fold class or systematically
rejected any class, except for unstructured peptides and membrane
proteins.

3.4 Selection of metafold representatives

Our primary purpose in creating the CDD was to facilitate the
simulation of both the native state dynamics and the unfolding
behavior of at least one domain from each metafold. As such,
we examined domains from each metafold to ﬁnd a high-quality
structure suitable for simulation. Such a domain was then selected as
a ‘metafold representative’, or target, of that metafold and prepared
for simulation. If no suitable domain could be found we chose one
domain from the metafold to represent the reason that the metafold
was rejected (Fig. 5 and Table 2). The selected representatives for
the top 30 most populated metafolds are presented in Figure 6,
the full target set is provided in Supplementary Table S3. Selected
representatives could come from a variety of structural contexts;
387 representatives were the ﬁill contents of their PDB structure
deposition, 165 representatives were a ﬁill chain from a multi-chain
deposition and 165 representatives were excised domains where a
chain was chopped to select the domain.

We identiﬁed at least one domain suitable for simulation from
807 of 1695 metafolds in the V2009 CDD. Of the remaining 888
metafolds, 585 metafolds consisted of domains that were not self-
contained and 87 metafolds consisted of domains that were irregular
or unstructured. These 672 metafolds are non-autonomous structural
units (corresponding to 75% of the rejected metafolds or 40% of
the total number of metafolds). A summary of the reasons that
a domain from a metafold was rejected is presented in Table 2.
These rejected domains fell into three categories: domain-swapped
dimers, domains with a large buried interface in the experimentally

determined structure of a complex and domains with secondary
structure elements that continue into other domains of the protein
(Fig. 5). There was no signiﬁcant bias in the rejected metafolds
with respect to major fold class (all at, all 0 and mixed 01/0). In 11
metafolds, no domains of less than 450 residues were present so the
metafold was rejected for reasons of size. In 27 cases, the domains
of the metafolds in question were contained in a transmembrane
region. There were 57 metafolds whose domains required an obligate
cofactor. There were 85 metafolds where each of the domains
contained a large (greater than 7 residue) gap and were rejected. In
20 metafolds, all domains had a resolution lower than 3 .0 A. Finally,
there were two singleton metafolds that were rejected because their
domains were of disputed structural validity at the time of writing
(Krishna Murthy et (11., 2009).

In 19 cases, we selected a domain but the resulting native
state simulation was not stable and the metafold was rejected.
Interestingly, the 19 starting structures were all determined by NMR.
For 5 of the 19 targets, alternate fold representatives in the form
of high-resolution crystal structures were available; the resulting
‘replacement’ simulations were stable. In the other 14 cases, it was
either the only structure for the metafold (with rank 633 or higher) or
the alternatives were older PDB entries of equal or lesser quality. In
other words for these ‘rejected by simulation’ cases, no alternative
replacement could be found from their respective metafolds, but it
would appear to be a problem with the starting structures and not
necessarily the simulations (See van der Kamp et (11., 2010 for more
details).

4 DSCUSSON

The recognition of spatially distinct motifs and structural patterns
is a long-standing component of structural protein studies (Phillips,
1967; Wetlaufer, 1973). The understanding of the term ‘domain’ to
denote an autonomous, structurally cohesive unit is similarly well
established (Levitt and Chothia, 1976). However, the multiple extant
deﬁnitions for ‘domain’ do not always converge (Majumdar et (11.,
2009; Sowdhamini and Blundell, 1995). A spatially distinct region
within a structure may not coincide with an autonomous, stable
unit. Our interest in domain dictionaries is to establish a systematic,
broad sampling of topologies that satisfy our autonomy criterion.
The single most striking conclusion from this endeavor was that a
signiﬁcant fraction of metafolds generated by our consensus method
contained no suitable for simulation. This occurred due to a variety of
factors, but the single largest reason for rejection was that the domain
was not self-contained. Identiﬁcation of protein domains can be split
into two problems: the partition of a chain into multiple domains, and
the separation of domains into folds. The difﬁculty of partitioning
a chain into domains has been well studied (Holland et (11., 2006;
Veretnik et (11., 2004). The separation of domains into fold has been
similarly examined. Both problems share similar elements. It may
be that the smallest repeating structural element observed between
two structures is not necessarily a shared domain. For example, if
chain discontinuity is allowed within a domain to increase structural
similarity of the domains in a fold, then the structural integrity of
the excised region may be sacriﬁced. The problem becomes more
complex when considering domains that are solely observed in the
context of multimeric structures or in complexes. In our opinion,
one must be very careful to consider the effect inadvertent inclusion
of such domains may have on bioinformatics studies; they are not

independent, globular structures. We note that the distribution of
autonomous and non-autonomous domains is not necessarily related
to the dependent or independent folding of these domains in nature.
Indeed, characterizing the unfolding behavior of the autonomous
domains is one of the primary goals of the simulations that we have
performed of these domains.

We have generated a CDD from three major domain dictionaries.
This CDD contains 1695 metafolds. We have inspected each
metafold and selected a representative. These representatives
constitute our release set, which consists of 807 ‘simulatable’
domains. These 807 metafolds represent 81% (64 700) of the
domains in our CDD, or 95% of the known autonomous protein folds
(Table 2). This set of domains is the basis for our high-throughput
MD simulation of representatives of all globular protein folds (Beck
et (11., 2008; van der Kamp et (11., 2010). Also, to reduce artifacts,
we would suggest that the reduced list of 807 metafolds be used for
bioinformatics studies, not the full CDD, nor the domain dictionaries
from which they were derived.

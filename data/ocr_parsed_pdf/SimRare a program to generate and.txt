traits, a random or an extreme trait sample can be generated.
When an extreme quantitative trait sample is generated, the
ranges can be speciﬁed, e.g. upper 90% and lower 10%. All
sample sizes can be user—speciﬁed. Causal variants within a
‘gene’ region can either have an effect which is unidirectional
e.g. all variants increase disease risk or are bidirectional, e.g.
can either decrease or increase quantitative trait values. A pro—
portion of the variants can also be non—causal. For causal vari—
ants, the magnitude of the effect can either be ﬁxed, i.e. all causal
variants have the same effect size or variable, effect size is deter—
mined by frequency or selection coeff1cients.

2.3 Analysis of data and evaluation of Type I and II errors

It is possible to analyze the generated data using a wide range of
complex trait rare variant association methods, e.g. combined
multivariate and collapsing method (Li and Leal, 2008), weighted
sum statistic (Madsen and Browning, 2009), variable threshold
(Price et al., 2010) and Kernel—based adaptive cluster (Liu and
Leal, 2010). Additionally, any newly developed rare variant as—
sociation method written in R can be evaluated using SimRare.
For casewontrol studies and randomly ascertained quantitative
trait studies, qualitative and quantitative analysis is performed,
respectively. While for an extreme quantitative trait sample, the
data can be dichotomized and qualitative analysis performed or
the quantitative trait values can be analyzed. For rare variant
association methods where signif1cance cannot be evaluated ana—
lytically, P—values can be obtained empirically through permuta—
tion. For the evaluation of Type I and II error, the user
determines the number of permutations and/ or replicates which
should be generated.

2.4 Software overview

SimRare, a stand—alone executable software, is compiled for
Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. Installation of R
is only required if it is desired to evaluate novel methods.
SimRare consists of three major modules: simulation of
sequence—based genotype data, generation of phenotype data
and evaluation of association methods. SimRare has a
user—friendly interface. Output from SimRare can either take
the form of tables or graphs, e.g. QQ plots for Type I errors
and bar graphs to display power. Additionally, simulated data
can be written to external files in standard linkage format.

Benchmark tests were performed on a 64—bit machine with
Intel 3.2GHz CPU and 8 GB RAM installed with the Ubuntu
Linux operating system. First 100 haplotype pools were gener—
ated using a population demographic model described by
Kryukov et a]. (2009) model; the time to generate each pool
was 1.8 min. The generated haplotype pools can be used for all
subsequent power analyses. The total computation time for the
power analysis was 18.4 min when 1000 replicates were generated
each with 1000 case and 1000 controls and power was evaluated
using the combined multivariate and collapsing method (Li and
Leal, 2008).

3 DISCUSSION

SimRare, as a simulation platform with integrated modules
of data generation and statistical analysis, can be widely used

at many different levels for rare variant association studies.
SimRare can be used to impartially assess the power and robust—
ness of novel and existing rare variant association methods under
a broad range of scenarios. These features should greatly aid
researchers in the development of rare variant association meth—
ods. SimRare can also assist genetic epidemiological study de—
signs by allowing the power to be tested for a wide variety of
scenarios. For instance, for a population—based casewontrol
exome—sequence study SimRare can be used determine the neces—
sary sample size to achieve adequate power under a variety of
different phenotypic and genetic models.

SimRare will greatly increase the ability and speed in which
researchers can develop novel methods. SimRare allows re—
searchers to create methods without having to develop special
software to generate data in order to evaluate their methods.
It also facilitates an easy way to compare their method to
existing methods, because evaluation can be performed on con—
sistent datasets and additionally it is not necessary to write
software to implement existing methods for comparison pur—
poses. Ultimately, we expect this universally functional soft—
ware equipped with user—friendly interface to aid genetic
epidemiologists and statistical geneticist in the development of
methods and the design of sequence—based genetic association
studies.

Abstract

Motivation: Only a few large systematic studies have evaluated the impact of copy number vari—
ants (CNVs) on common diseases. Several million individuals have been genotyped on single nu—
cleotide variation arrays, which could be used for genome—wide CNVs association studies.
However, CNV calls remain prone to false positives and only empirical filtering strategies exist in
the literature. To overcome this issue, we defined a new quality score (OS) estimating the probabil—
ity of a CNV called by PennCNV to be confirmed by other software.

Results: Out—of—sample comparison showed that the correlation between the consensus CNV status
and the OS is twice as high as it is for any previously proposed CNV filters. ROC curves displayed
an AUC higher than 0.8 and simulations showed an increase up to 20% in statistical power when
using OS in comparison to other filtering strategies. Superior performance was confirmed also for
alternative consensus CNV definition and through improving known CNV—trait associations.

1 Introduction

Genetic variations range from single nucleotide variations (SNPs) to
large chromosomal rearrangement (aneuploidy). Within this spec-
trum deleted, inserted and duplicated stretches of nucleotides longer
than 1 kb (sometimes 500 bp with the use of deep coverage Next-
Generation Sequencing) are referred to as copy number variants
(CNVs) (Feuk et (11., 2006; Valsesia et (11., 2013). CNVs have been
found genome-wide in both disease and healthy populations
(Craddock et (11., 2010; Grozeva et (11., 2010; Iafrate et (11., 2004;
Itsara et (11., 2009; Jacquemont et (11., 2011; Mannik et (11., 2015;
Redon et (11., 2006; Walters et (11., 2010; Zhang et (11., 2009). Their
function has been wider studied; in the context of the rare

diseases—rare variant paradigm (Jacquemont et (11., 2011; Walters
et (11., 2010; Zarrei et (11., 2015; Zufferey et (11., 2012) or as motor of
evolution (Feuk et (11., 2006; Nguyen et (11., 2008; Sudmant et (11.,
2015). Association with complex traits such as BMI has been shown
in the case of the l6pll.2 rearrangement (Jacquemont et (11., 2011;
Walters et (11., 2010; Zufferey et al., 2012); but also with cognitive
functions in several general population cohorts |Decode (Stefansson
et (11., 2014) and Estonia (Mannik et (11., 2015)|. Most successful
CNV association studies are based on candidate gene approaches
(Brasch—Andersen et (11., 2004; Fanciulli et (11., 2007; Gonzalez et (11.,
2005; McKinney et (11., 2008; Yang et (11., 2007) and—unlike
SNPs—their genome-wide impact has not yet been fully elucidated.

Consequently, large genome—wide CNV studies would be instrumen—
tal to decipher the impact of genetic rearrangements underlying
complex traits and disease susceptibility.

Initially, extremely large copy number alterations (>3—5 mega—
bases) were detected using karyotyping (Dowjat and Wlodarska,
1981; Nister et al., 1987; Pepler et al., 1968). Then, fluorescence in
situ hybridization increased the resolution enabling the detection of
sub—microscopic events (Feuk et al., 2005, 2006; Ravnan et al., 2006).
Nowadays, CNVs can be detected using different molecular technolo—
gies and methods. NGS technologies allow sequencing millions of
reads in parallel and new methods for structural variants analysis
have been developed, including paired—end mapping, read—depth ana—
lysis, split—read strategies and sequence assembly comparisons (Tan
et al., 2014; Valsesia et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013). The other main
methods to detect CNVs are based on micro—array technologies, either
Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH) arrays (Carter, 2007;
Kallioniemi et al., 1992; Redon et al., 2009; Ylstra et al., 2006) or
SNP genotyping arrays (Conrad et al., 2006; McCarroll et al., 2006).

We focused on CNV detection based on SNP genotyping arrays,
as millions of individuals have already been genotyped on SNP
arrays and many of these samples were used in meta—analysis of
Genome—Wide Association Studies (GWAS) (Locke et al., 2015;
Wood et al., 2014). Thus, a wealth of unexploited information re—
mains available in these cohorts and could be re—analyzed for
genome—wide CNVs association. The flip side of using genotyping
arrays is the lower reliability of the CNV detection, as these plat—
forms were not initially designed to detect such genomic events.
However, more recent ones can contain CNV probes.

Despite this limitation, several algorithms have been developed
for CNV detection. At each probe, a relative copy number ratio can
be obtained by combining the intensities of the two alleles and nor—
malizing this quantity with respect to a reference (log R ratio—
LRR). Deviation from the copy number ratio baseline will corres—
pond to either a loss or gain. Several publicly available software
(Valsesia et al., 2013) improve copy number calls by exploiting the
ratio of allelic intensities (normalized measure of the signal intensity
ratio of the B and A alleles—B Allele Frequency—BAP). In this art—
icle, we focus on the PennCNV software (Wang et al., 2007), cur—
rently the most widely used software for Illumina chips (PennCNV:
955 citations—QuantiSNP: 432 citations). This software, based on
a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), is extensively used for CNV de—
tection on SNP. Its speed is a key advantage as number of available
samples increase at an unprecedented scale.

Nevertheless, CNV detection remains prone to false positives,
which adds noise when such calls are used for trait association.
There is a need to develop a new quality score (QS) for CNVs de—
tected by PennCNV, prior to performing CNV—based association
studies. Our contribution can be viewed as a post—processing step of
PennCNV calls, whereby various CNV metrics are combined to esti—
mate the probability of a called CNV to be a likely consensus call.
This probability could then be used as copy number dosage for trait
associations. We chose to improve CNV detection in a way that is
directly applicable for large meta—analytic GWAS, where analysts
preferably want to run only a single and fast CNV calling pipeline
and provide association summary statistics from various platforms.

2 Methods

2.1 Cohorts
HYPERGENES is a case/control cohort of 4206 individuals, where
controls were selected based on the absence of hypertension while

cases were hypertensive (Salvi et al., 2012). Genotyping was done
on Illumina 1M—Duo BeadChips capturing 1 199 187 SNPs and was
performed in two different centers, one in Geneva and one in
Milano; leading to two sub cohorts: HYPERGENES Geneva with
1995 individuals and HYPERGENES Milano with 2,211 individ—
uals. The GenomeStudio software produced final reports with LRR
and BAF values.

The Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS) is a prospective mul—
ticentre study carried out in Switzerland and recruiting HCV—
positive patients (Prasad et al., 2007). A total of 1152 patients were
genotyped on the same Illumina platform as HYPERGENES indi—
viduals. The GenomeStudio software produced final reports with
LRR and BAF values.

The Swiss Kidney Project on Genes Hypertension (SKIPOGH) is
a population—based cross—sectional family study that examines the
genetic determinants of blood pressure. The study population
included 1128 participants from 271 nuclear families. In our project
we used genetic data from 169 trios genotyped on Illumina 2.5.
(Ponte et al., 2014; Pruijm et al., 2013).

The UK BioBank is a study of 500 000 individuals from the UK
aged between 37 and 73 years and genotyped on Affymetrix Axiom
(http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/). Data from 119 873 individuals,
with genetics and BMI information, were used in the scope of this
project.

2.2 CNV calling

CNVs were called using three different software: PennCNV (Wang
et al., 2007), QuantiSNP (Colella et al., 2007) and CNVpartition
(http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_
cnv_algorithms.pdf). PennCNV is a HMM based software de—
veloped to call CNVs using LRR and BAF values for each sample
genotyped on Illumina platform. A ‘population BAF’ (PFB) file was
created for each cohort based on 200 randomly selected final re—
ports. The clezm_cml.pl script was called with default parameters to
merge adjacent CNVs with small gaps. Samples with more than 200
CNVs were excluded from further analysis. QuantiSNP is also a
HMM—based software developed to call CNVs using LRR and BAF
values. CNVpartition, developed by Illumina, defines 14 different
copy number states and for each of them, jointly models the LRRs
and BAFs as a bivariate Gaussian distribution. Based on these distri—
butions, it calculates the likelihood of each of the 14 states for a
given LRR and BAF. For all three software, CNVs were called using
default parameters.

2.3 Consensus CNV

For each CNV detected by PennCNV, we looked at the fraction de—
tected by the two other software, a percentage of agreement for each
CNV is then calculated. Zero percent agreement means that none of
the CNV probes called by PennCNV is detected by the two other
software, 50% means that half of the CNV probes are detected by
all the other software and 100% means that all the probes within
the CNV are retrieved by both CNVpartition and QuantiSNP. We
considered a CNV to be a consensus call if its percentage of agree—
ment is above 70%, meaning that the two other software detect at
least 70% of it. We used this working definition of a consensus
CNV. Other definitions could be imagined (see Section 4), but we
chose this mainly due to data availability in large samples.

2.4 Modeling consensus calls
For each CNV detected by PennCNV we would like to predict
whether the two other software would confirm it, i.e. whether it is a

/3.IO‘SI€III[10[p.IO}X0‘SDDEIIIJOJIIIOIQ/[Zdllq

consensus call. To this end, we modeled the dichotomized overlap
percentage, as a function of various PennCNV parameters using a
logistic model (see Equation 1). Ten available parameters were con—
sidered: confidence score, CNV length, number of probes, LRR
mean, LRR standard deviation, BAF mean, BAF standard deviation,
waviness factor (WF) and the total number of CNVs per individual.
For more information regarding the definition of the quality metrics,
please refer to the Supplementary Table 51, to the PennCNV de—
scription (Wang et al., 2007) and the associated website (http://
penncnv.0penbioinformatics.0rg/en/latest/). The first three param—
eters characterize each CNV in a specific sample, while the others
correspond to the global signal quality for each individual.

, 10
my : 11V1,V2,...,V10):log1t(/}0 + Zia rm) (1)

Variable Y was defined as 1 if the CNV was confirmed by the two
other software and zero otherwise. It is the collection of values for
all probes and all samples. Variables V, represent the various CNV/
sample parameters provided by the PennCNV software. Step—wise
logistic regression using the R function step was performed separ—
ately for deletions and duplications. Coefficients I}, with a corres—
ponding P—value below 1075 were considered as significant and
were set to zero otherwise. Coefficients were estimated separately
for each test cohort and used for cross—validation purposes. In the
future, the mean of these coefficients can be used for new cohorts.
Furthermore, as the coefficients are correlated, we are less interested
in their actual values but rather in their combination.

2.5 OS calculation

The coefficients from the logistic model obtained from one/some c0—
hort(s) can be used to estimate the probability of a CNV being a
consensus call in other cohorts. We termed this quantity as QS,
hence its value indicates the probability of a CNV called by
PennCNV parameters being a consensus call.

QScnv : 

1
1 +exp(—(ﬁo + 2:, AV»)

These values are multiplied by —1 in case of deletions to retain
both quality and copy number information. Note that the variables
used in the formula are only the ones retained after stepwise selec—
tion (in the independent data set).

2.6 Previous measures of CNV quality

As PennCNV calls admittedly contain many false positives, popu—
lar filtering criteria have been recommended and applied in many
studies (Chettier et al., 2014; Glessner et al., 2013; Palta et al.,
2015; Pinto et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2007). We tested different
quality metrics filtering combinations to compare with our QS
(Table 1).

2.7 Quality metric comparison through correlation

To evaluate the performance of our newly proposed CNV QS and
previously applied metrics, we compared how well the different
CNV quality metrics agree with the consensus calls defined by soft—
ware overlap. First, for each cohort, Spearman correlation between
the consensus CNV status and CNV quality metrics were calculated.
We compared the confidence score, the different filters and the QS.
The QS coefficients were based on the average coefficients leaving
out the test cohort.

These ﬁlters were used to evaluate the performance of our QS in compari-
son to what is usually used in the literature: ﬁlters A (Palta et al., 2015), B
(Wang et al., 2007), C (Chettier et al., 2014 ), D (Glessner et al., 2013) and E
(Pinto et al., 2011 ).

2.8 Quality metric comparison through receiver
operating characteristic curve

To evaluate the discriminatory power of the proposed QS, we
computed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and
estimated the area under the curve (AUC). The QS (based on the
leave—one (c0h0rt)—0ut cross—validation) was used as the predictor
and the consensus CNV status as the response. Two different defin—
itions of the consensus CNV status were used. The first one con—
siders all the CNVs and defines a consensus CNV as one detected by
the three software and false CNV all the others. The second defin—
ition was the same as the first, but ignored all CNVs that were called
by two software only.

2.9 Quality metric comparison through simulated
CNV—phenotype association

Simulations were done at the probe level. When two probes have the
same profile across all samples, we kept only one representative.
Then, for each cohort, we assessed the performance of the QS. We
first converted the CNVs metrics into (no. of probes >< no. of sam—
ples) tables in order to overcome the problem of different CNVs
boundaries across samples. We then simulated association between
an in silico phenotype and: (i) PennCNV raw CNV calls, (ii)
PennCNV confidence score, (iii) the different filters, (iv) the QS
based on the average coefficients leaving out one cohort. Then simu—
lations were done for each probe separately. For a specific probe, an
in silico phenotype is simulated based on the consensus CNV status
(defined as the overlap between the three software), an effect size
and noise (Equation 3). The effect sizes ([3) ranged from 0 to 3 by a
step of 0.05 and the noise (8) was set to follow a standard Gaussian
distribution (mean : 0, variance : 1):

y : CNVconsensus * ﬂ + 8 

Linear regressions were then performed to derive association be—
tween this in silico phenotype and the estimated CNV status (based
on filtered CNVs, confidence score or QS). We ran thousand simula—
tions for each effect size, and we estimated the statistical power to
detect an association at or : 1073. Simulations were done separately
for deletions and duplications. Within each cohort, we calculated,
for each probe, the CNV frequency (Equation 4) and the precision
(Prec) (Equation 5).

CNVs probes were classified according to their precision and fre—
quency. Power computations are presented for 30 (:5 X 6) different
bins of frequency (5 bins) and precision (6 bins) combinations. CNV
frequency bins boundaries were set at 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 100%.
Precision bins boundaries were set at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and
100%.

2.10 08 validation for other consensus definition

We used pennCNV to call CNV on the 169 trios from the
SKIPOGH study. We defined consensus CNVs as those called by
pennCNV both for the proband and at least one of its parents. For
all CNVs called for the probands we calculated the QS and also
applied the different filters. To assess the agreement between con—
sensus CNV status and the different measures we used logistic re—
gression with consensus status as outcome and (i) QS value, (ii)
confidence score, (iii) the different filters as predictors.

2.11 Recovering the known 16p11.2

CNV—BMI association

We called CNVs in the 16p11.2 region in 119 873 UK BioBank par—
ticipants using pennCNV. For each CNV a QS was estimated and
the different filters were applied. Then for the entire cohort, we cal—
culated the association between the inverse quantile normalized
BMI and (i) QS, (ii) the confidence score, (iii) the raw copy number
state and (iv) the different filters.

3 Results

3.1 Percentage of agreement

The percentage of CNVs detected by PennCNV and confirmed by
the two other software is between 20 and 30% (Supplementary
Table 52, Supplementary Figs. 51—53). The results are consistent
across the three cohorts with a slightly better percentage of agree—
ment for the duplications than for the deletions. These results mean
that three quarters of the PennCNV calls may be false positives, add—
ing noise to downstream analyses. It confirms the necessity to de—
velop a new quality measure that estimates the probability of a
CNV call to be a consensus call, in order to increase detection power
and avoid spurious associations due to systematic artifacts.

3.2 OS coefficients

For each CNV (called by PennCNV), its QS is computed to estimate
the probability of being a consensus call (see Section 2). The QS is
derived from a logistic model, whose coefficients (for each CNV and
sample characteristic) were estimated separately for deletions and
duplications using three cohorts. Coefficients with significant
P—value (<10’5) were kept for the final model (Supplementary
Tables 53—55). As expected, the confidence score provided by
PennCNV is the parameter with the strongest contribution (coeffi—
cient ranging from 2.21 to 4.77, P < 107300). It confirms that CNVs
with high confidence scores are more likely to be consensus calls.
The number of CNVs per individual has a negative coefficient (rang—
ing from —0.57 to —0.17), which means that CNVs called from
sample with few CNVs are most probably consensus calls.
Interestingly, the coefficients of the mean LRR have opposite values
between deletions and duplications. This behavior is consistent
across the three cohorts and is unlikely by chance. This is due to the
fact that, for a deletion, it is easier to detect a drop in the intensity

signal if the global LRR mean value is high. The contrary applies for
duplications. The negative coefficients for the number of probes
might appear counterintuitive. But in the case of multivariate regres—
sion, the estimates of correlated variables (e.g. the correlation be—
tween PennCNV confidence score and the number of probes was 0.
56) are difficult to interpret. Furthermore, in a univariate model, the
number of probes has a significant positive estimate for the duplica—
tions in all the three cohorts. Regarding the deletions, estimates are
either positive or not significant.

3.3 08 distribution

QS values have been computed separately for deletions and duplica—
tions on the three samples groups coming from two cohorts. The dis—
tribution of the QSs (Panels A and B Supplementary Figs. 54—56)
shows a bimodal distribution: most of the CNVs are either of bad or
good quality, and only few stand in between. As seen for the per—
centage of agreement, the majority of CNVs are most likely false
positive. If one prefers to work with dichotomized CNV calls, we
recommend to declare CNVs with QS > 0.5 as consensus CNVs
(Mannik et al., 2015).

The CNV frequency distribution (Panels C—D Supplementary
Figs. 54—56) reveals that the majority of deletions with low fre—
quency (33%) are of bad quality (QS < 0.5). On the contrary, most
of the duplications with a frequency lower than 0.4% have a high—
QS (QS 2 0.9). A large part of the deletions with frequency 23%
have intermediate (0.5 S QS < 0.9) or high (QS 2 0.9) QS, likewise
for duplications with frequency 2 10%. Since CNVs are called per
sample, frequency might be a predictor. These results show that
using our QS to filter CNVs may be particularly useful in the case of
rare deletions. In the case of duplications, the advantage is less ap—
parent and would be more relevant for intermediate frequencies (be—
tween 0.4 and 10%).

Regarding the length (Panels E and F Supplementary Figs. 54—
56), almost all the CNVs with high QS are longer than 10 kb. It con—
firms the difficulty to detect small CNVs on SNP array platforms.
When applied to CNV—phenotype associations, our QS has the po—
tential to reduce the noise created by false calls especially for CNVs
with length <75 kb. It would increase the power to detect associ—
ations with short CNVs, which have not yet been implicated with
any complex traits.

3.4 Quality metric comparison through correlation

The correlation of the consensus CNV status (defined by the overlap
between the three software) with the QS (based on the leave—one (c0—
h0rt)—0ut cross—validation) is twice as high as with the classical fil—
ters for all types of CNVs and all cohorts (e.g. 0.53 versus 0.26 for
Hypergenes GVA and all CNV types; 0.45 versus 0.22 for SCCS and
all CNV types; see Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S6—S7). This
score has also a ~20% higher correlation than the confidence score
for the deletions and has similar performance for the duplications.
The correlations are consistent over the three cohorts and are
slightly higher for deletions than for duplications. Table 2 points out
the unexpectedly low performance of the classical filters, which per—
form much worse than the confidence score provided by PennCNV.
To summarize, in case of deletions, our QS is a better proxy for the
consensus calls than the classical filtering or the PennCNV confi—
dence score.

Although the above table reports only average performance for
the whole genome, we give a graphical overview of the distribution
of correlations according to CNV frequency and detectability (preci—
sion). The box plots (Fig. 1) show detailed performance for CNVs

Fig. 3. CNV-phenotype association simulation based on deletions detected in
the Hypergenes Geneva samples. Associations were done with different qual-
ity metrics such as the 08, the confidence score, the classical filters: A (Palta
et al., 2015), B (Wang et al., 2007), C (Chettier et al., 2014), D (Glessner et al.,
2013) and E (Pinto et al., 2011), as defined the method section, and the raw
CNV calls. CNVs were classified according to their precision and frequency.
The frequency range for this boxplot is between 1 and 5% while the precision
range is between 10 and 20%. This plot shows the statistical power as a func-
tion of the effect size for the different quality metrics. N corresponds to the
number of unique probes being in the precision and CNVfrequency window

probes. Comparable simulations have been made for duplications
(see Supplementary Figs. S18—S20) and, in accordance with the cor-
relation analysis, our QS performs similarly to the confidence score
or the raw copy number. Here again, the classical filters perform the
worst. Note that our simulations were based on small samples (n <
2000), hence large simulated effect sizes were necessary to reach
high meaningful power.

3.7 OS validation for other consensus definition

We estimated the performance of the OS by using a different defin-
ition of the consensus CNV status. A CNV detected in an offspring
was defined to be consensus if it was also detected in at least one of
the two parents. This definition doesn’t take into account de 7101/0
CNVs but their occurrence is relatively low (Veltman and Brunner,
2012). Using this consensus definition, our QS (P: 4‘110T80) clearly
outperforms all classical filters (P > 211040) and the confidence
score (P:7"’10T60) from pennCNV, considering all the CNVs to-
gether (Supplementary Table S8) as well as when looking at deletions
and duplications separately (Supplementary Tables S9 and S10).

3.8 Recovering the known 16p11.2 CNV—BMI association
Two CNVs in the 16p11.2 region are robustly associated with BMI
(Jacquemont et al., 2011; Zufferey et al., 2012). Therefore, they can
be used to benchmark the performance of the different quality meas-
ures: Stronger association of these CNVs with BMI is an indicator of
performance. We computed the association between BMI and (i) the
QS, (ii) the confidence score, (iii) the raw copy number state and (iv)
the different filters for CNVs detected in the 16p11.2 region using
119 873 individuals from the UK BioBank. The association P—values
for OS were on average >10-fold smaller than for any that of the
other CNV measures. The QQplot (Supplementary Fig. S21) clearly

shows inflation for low P-values in this region. However, this infla-
tion is stronger when using the OS as genotypic data compared with
using any raw data or filters. Furthermore, the fraction of probes, in
this region, that pass the genome-wide significance level at 2"“10’7 is
clearly higher when using our OS (44.4%) than any of the other
CNV measures (39.6% at best, Supplementary Table S11).

4 Discussion

Our QS has been built in order to estimate the probability of a CNV
to be a consensus call based on the fact that consensus CNV is
defined as the overlap of CNV calls from three distinct software
applied to Illumina genotyping arrays. We have demonstrated
through ROC, correlation and power analyses that our QS can bet-
ter recover consensus CNVs than other CNV quality metrics.
Naturally, many other consensus definitions could be used. For ex-
ample, CNVs called by only one other software may not necessarily
be false and hence could have been classified as neither false, nor
true calls. This definition of consensus, however, did not change the
conclusions (Supplementary Figs. S22—S24). Using trio data, we
have also explored a definition where CNV calls confirmed in (at
least) one of the parents are deemed as consensus CNVs. Notably,
our QS recovered these consensus calls significantly better than
other quality measures and filters. Finally, we demonstrated the ad-
vantage of the OS through (re-)discovering the known 16p11.2
CNV-BMI associations in the UK Biobank. Here again, association
P—values for the OS were >10-fold smaller than those of any other
CNV quality metric.

We thus recommend the use of this metric, as a probabilistic
CNV dosage for CNV association studies. This metric has been used
to search association between CNV load and cognitive phenotypes
in unselected populations (Mannik et al., 2015). Our CNV calls reli-
ably led to stronger association results and retrieved the same CNV
frequencies as in the discovery cohort [where some CNVs have been
manually confirmed (Mannik et al., 2015)].

It would have been possible to define the consensus as the over-
lap between CNV calls from multiple genotyping technologies [e.g.
genotyping arrays, array CGH (aCGH) or whole genome sequenc-
ing (WGS)] applied for the same study participants. Unfortunately,
even though aCGH is widely used for CNVs detection in clinical set-
tings, there is no gold standard software (Hupe et al., 2004; Pique—
Regi et al., 2008; Valsesia et al., 2012; van Houte et al., 2010;
Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007) for genome-wide CNV calling in
large population samples. Similarly, algorithms calling CNVs from
WGS are in early stages (Abyzov et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2009;
Klambauer et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2012). Another problem is data
availability: there are over hundred-fold more population-based
samples available with genotyping chip data than those with aCGH
or WGS. An additional problem for WGS is that the coverage is usu-
ally below 10, which insufficient for reliable CNV calling (http://
www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/). In the future, when
such data become available on larger scale one can apply our ap-
proach to other consensus CNV definitions.

Over the past years, many GWAS based on Illumina SNP array
data have been performed for different traits (Feuk et al., 2005;
Locke et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2014). All these data could be re-
analyzed to perform CNV association studies using our QS as CNV
allele dosage for associations just like the currently used imputed
genotype dosages (Kutalik et al., 2011). This would allow a better
filtering and would increase statistical power especially for rare dele-
tions as it has been demonstrated in the Results. Such rare variants

have to be meta—analyzed in a way such that the imputation quality
is taken into account in the meta—analysis.

As shown in our simulations, the power advantage offered by the
QS may not be remarkable for individual cohorts, but much more so
in the context of meta—analysis facilitating the collection of large sam—
ples. Although larger and larger association studies of common/rare
single nucleotide variants reveal increasing proportions of the ‘missing
heritability”, rare CNVs are relatively neglected apart from a few suc—
cessful examples (Jacquemont et al., 2011; Walters et al., 2010;
Zufferey et al., 2012). Therefore, as a future work, we will apply this
quality measure in the context of large meta—analytic CNV—association
studies on anthropometric traits. In particular, for BMI, the heritabil—
ity of which is estimated to be 40—70%, but common variants seem to
account for <25 % (Locke et al., 2015; Maes et al., 1997; Zaitlen
et al., 2013). To this purpose, we wrapped up the OS calculation in a
pipeline designed to run CNV trait associations. This pipeline has
been tested with 18 analysts (on 70 000 samples) and is available on—
line (http://g00.gl/T6quM).

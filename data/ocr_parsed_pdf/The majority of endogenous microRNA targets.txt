ABSTRACT

Motivation: The massive spread of repetitive elements in the human
genome presents a substantial challenge to the organism, as such
elements may accidentally contain seemingly functional motifs. A strik-
ing example is offered by the roughly one million copies of Alu repeats
in the genome, of which ~0.5% reside within genes’ untranslated re-
gions (UTRs), presenting ~30 000 novel potential targets for highly
conserved microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we examine the functionality
of miRNA targets within Alu elements in 3’UTRs in the human genome.
Results: Using a comprehensive dataset of miRNA overexpression
assays, we show that mRNAs with miRNA targets within Alus
are significantly less responsive to the miRNA effects compared with
mRNAs that have the same targets outside Alus. Using Ago2-binding
mRNA profiling, we confirm that the miRNA machinery avoids miRNA
targets within Alus, as opposed to the highly efficient binding of targets
outside Alus. We propose three features that prevent potential miRNA
sites within Alus from being recognized by the miRNA machinery:
(i) Alu repeats that contain miRNA targets and genuine functional
miRNA targets appear to reside in distinct mutually exclusive territories
within 3’UTRs; (ii) Alus have tight secondary structure that may limit
access to the miRNA machinery; and (iii) A-to-l editing of Alu-derived
mRNA sequences may divert miRNA targets. The combination of
these features is proposed to allow toleration of Alu insertions into
mRNAs. Nonetheless, a subset of miRNA targets within Alus appears
not to possess any of the aforementioned features, and thus may
represent cases where Alu insertion in the genome has introduced
novel functional miRNA targets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Repetitive elements are very widely spread in primate genomes
(Lander et al., 2001). Most prominent is the case of the Short
Interspersed Elements, and in particular the Alu elements, which
are present in more than a million copies in the human genome.
Such massive presence of foreign genomic elements, which are
perceived as predominantly selﬁsh DNA, may represent a

substantial potential informational load on the genome.
Accordingly, the retrotransposition of Alus may contribute to
human disease, including a diversity of cancers (Batzer and
Deininger, 2002). At the same time, the spread of genetic mater-
ial may also represent an opportunity to introduce evolutionary
novelty into the genome. Indeed, Alu elements may become
exons (Lev-Maor et al., 2003) and may harbour functional tran-
scription factor (Polak and Domany, 2006) and microRNAs
(miRNA) binding sites (Smalheiser and TorVik, 2006). In par-
ticular, Smalheiser and Torvik identiﬁed many mRNAs that con-
tain Alus in their 3/ untranslated regions (UTRs), within which
there are targets for dozens of miRNAs (Smalheiser and TorVik,
2006). Along with these negative and positive potential contribu-
tions to cellular and organismal ﬁtness, it is conceivable that the
spread of many of the retroelements was restricted evolutionarily
so that most of the current elements are largely benign. Possibly,
the insertion of retroelements into mRNAs was not random but
was affected by features that minimize their impact on functional
elements in the genome.

Focusing here on potential miRNA binding sites within Alus
in 3/UTRs, we provide evidence that the majority of miRNA
targets within Alus are non-functional and presumably ignored
by the miRNA machinery. We propose three features that
allowed the insertion of Alu-hosted miRNA targets into
mRNAs with minimal distortion of miRNA regulation. Still, a
minority of the insertions appears not to possess any of these
features and may thus represent cases in which Alu insertions
contributed novel functional miRNA targets to the primates
lineage.

2 METHODS

Human and mouse genomes and repeat sequences: The full human 3’UTR
sequence dataset was taken from UCSC (Fujita et al., 2011) NCB136/
hg18. Alu sequences and their locations were taken from Repeat Masker
(http://www.repeatmasker.org) (Smit et al., 199&2010). The mouse
3’UTR sequences and coordinates were taken from UCSC (Fujita
et al., 2011) (NCB137/mm9). The mouse repeats were taken from
UCSC Repeat Masker (Smit et al., 199672010).

Prediction of miRNA targets and conservation analysis: miRNA target
sites were predicted by scanning for the seed of the miRNA, on the basis
of perfect (WatsoniCrick) complementarity. Targets were deﬁned as per-
fect 7-mers, for all human and mouse miRNAs listed in miRBase release
15 (http://www.mirbase.org/) (Grifﬁths-Jones, 2004; Grifﬁths-Jones et al.,
2006; Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2008; Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011).
Conserved targets were taken from TargetScan release 5.1 (http://www.
targetscan.org/) (Grimson et al., 2007) m8 target type only (perfect

7-mer). The analysis of conservation and folding energy included only
genes with the following attributes: (i) the 3’UTR in the UCSC version
was the same as the 3’UTR used by TargetScan (as deﬁned in their
website) and (ii) the 3’UTR from UCSC was included within the
3’UTR deﬁned in TargetScan or the opposite.

Analysis of the miRNA over-expression data: The data of miRNA over-
expression experiments were taken from Khan et a]. (2009), which con-
tain siRNAs as well as miRNA overexpression experiments. A subset of
43 miRNA overexpression experiments was analysed. For each overex-
pressed miRNA, its site was scanned against all human 3’UTRs.
Downregulation of target mRNAs was deﬁned as the percentage of
genes with fold reduction of at least 1.62 (i.e. 0.7 on a log2 scale). The
cut-off was decided according to the distributions of average fold change
for genes with and without the miRNA target (Supplementary Fig. S7).
For each analysis, only experiments where the group of genes for con-
sideration consisted of at least eight genes were included.

Secondary structure prediction: Secondary structures were predicted for
all human and mouse 3’UTRs using the Bioinformatics Toolbox of
Matlab 10, which implements the M-Fold and Vienna algorithms
(Mathews et al., 1999; Wuchty et al., 1999). The analysis was done in
windows of 100 bp, and up to 50 bps from the last coding exon were
added to the beginning of the 3’UTR for the prediction. The secondary
structure status of each nucleotide of the 3’UTR was determined accord-
ing to its structure in the folding where this nucleotide was in position 51
(in the window of 100). The folding energy of each nucleotide was the
average folding energy of this nucleotide in all the folding windows in
which it was included.

Analysis of PAR-CLIP data: The raw data of the PAR-CLIP experi-
ment were taken from Kishore et a]. (2011). The representation of the
most abundant miRNAs in the PAR-CLIP data is highly correlated be-
tween replicates and between RNAse protocols. The experiment with the
highest number of mapped reads was further analysed (GSM714644).
The reads were mapped to the genome using Bowtie (Langmead et al.,
2009) (with the parameter ‘best’ so that for each read, we received only
one mapping and the hg18 genome index). The Bowtie output was ﬁltered
to include only reads with ﬁve mutations or less. The sequence of the
reads was corrected to the genome. The miRNA targets were identiﬁed in
the reads according to the reads’ genome-corrected sequence. The deci-
sion of which read is within Alu was according to the location of its best
mapping. We did not attempt to map the Alu reads to their exact location
in the genome (as the best mapping of Alu reads are probably one of
many best mappings, as they appear in many locations in the genome)
but simply infer from their best mapping if they are Alus or not.

Calculating miRNA targets representation in the transcriptome: For
each miRNA of the 10 most abundant miRNAs in the PAR-CLIP ex-
periment, the percentage of expressed miRNA targets within Alus was
calculated, according to the mRNA-Seq experiment that was done by
Kishore et a]. (2011) (GSM714678 and GSM714679, which mimic best
the conditions of the PAR-CLIP experiment). In each transcript, the
numbers of miRNA targets in total and within Alus were calculated,
and multiplied by the count of the transcript. Transcripts with low
count (<10) were excluded. The average of the two replicates is repre-
sented in the analysis.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Potential genomic interplay between Alus and
miRNAs

To evaluate the potential effect of Alu insertions in the human
genome on miRNA targeting, we ﬁrst examined how many
potential miRNA targets reside within Alu sequences in genes’
3/UTRs. This analysis showed that 16% of human genes contain
at least one Alu in their 3/UTR. A total of 4927 Alu sequences

that reside within 3/UTRs present 94 785 potential miRNA tar-
gets (deﬁned as 7-mers with perfect match to positions 278 of the
miRNA), 28 829 of which correspond to a set of 401 miRNAs
that are conserved among mammals (Dahary et al., 2010). Of
these, there are 3088 predicted targets for the 74 most conserved
miRNAs in the animal kingdom, which are therefore considered
as involved in basic cellular processes (Dahary et al., 2010).
Hence, at least in theory, the spread of Alus in the human
genome has a great potential to affect miRNA-based regulation
of gene expression.

3.2 A comprehensive dataset of transcriptome-wide effects
of miRNAs

To examine the effects of Alu insertions in 3/UTRs on gene
expression, we analysed data from reported miRNA overexpres-
sion experiments. Khan et a]. have recently assembled the results
of dozens such genome-wide expression array and proteomics
experiments into a single normalized database (Khan et al.,
2009). For subsequent analysis, we used a subset of experiments
from the Khan database, comprising 43 experiments with 23
different miRNAs overexpressed in a total of ﬁve different cell
lines. For each experiment, the dataset provides the genome-wide
mRNA response to the overexpression of one miRNA at a time
in a given cell line.

As a preliminary step, we assessed the potential of this dataset
to demonstrate known attributes of miRNA regulation. First, we
examined whether genes that contain a predicted binding target
for a particular miRNA are more likely than other genes to be
downregulated in response to overexpression of that miRNA.
Reassuringly, Figure 1A shows that the percentage of downre-
gulated genes was signiﬁcantly higher in the group of genes that
contain a putative binding site for the overexpressed miRNA,
relative to the group of genes lacking such binding site
(P:2.9e-21, Student’s t—test). In addition, the average fold
change of the downregulated genes on overexpression of the
miRNA was significantly higher in the group of genes containing
the binding site compared with the downregulation that is occa-
sionally observed among the control-set genes (P: 3.8e-12,
Student’s t-test; Supplementary Fig. SlA). Moreover, as already
suggested by others (Grimson et al., 2007; Nielsen et al., 2007),
genes with more than one putative binding site for a given
miRNA are more efﬁciently downregulated than genes with
only a single target (P: 5.5e-5, Student’s t—test; Fig. 1B).

The mere existence of a miRNA binding site sequence inside
the 3’UTR of a gene does not necessarily imply that the gene will
constitute a functional target for the miRNA. A commonly ac-
cepted hallmark of a target’s authentic functionality is its evolu-
tionary conservation (Brennecke et al., 2005; Grimson et al.,
2007; Lewis et al., 2005). Therefore, we next compared between
genes that contain a conserved versus non-conserved binding
motif for each overexpressed miRNA. Figure 1C shows that
the group of genes with conserved motifs has a signiﬁcantly
larger percentage of downregulated genes relative to human
genes that contain the same motif, but this motif is not conserved
in the orthologous genes of other mammals (P: 5.6e-14,
Student’s t-test). The same is true for the mean fold reduction
(P: 1.4e-4, Student’s t—test; Supplementary Fig. SlB).

Together, these results demonstrate that the miRNA
overexpression dataset reflects faithfully established parameters
of miRNA regulation and can therefore be further used to exam-
ine other features such as the effect of miRNA motifs inside Alu
sequences.

3.3 The miRNA binding sites inside Alus are less
functional

To discriminate between the effect of miRNA targets inside
versus outside Alus, we deﬁned for each miRNA in the dataset
two sets of genes: the ﬁrst consists of genes in which the putative
miRNA binding motif resides only inside Alus, and the second
contains the motif only outside Alus. Supplementary Table S1
summarizes the miRNAs from the Khan dataset and the number
of potential target genes in each of the two sets. As shown in
Figure 1D, genes with motifs only outside Alus are more likely to
be downregulated than genes with motifs only inside Alus
(P:2.2e-11, Student’s t—test). The same trend appears also
when assessing the average extent of downregulationithe fold
change on miRNA overexpression is signiﬁcantly higher for
genes containing the miRNA binding site only outside Alus
(P:0.03, Student’s t—test; Supplementary Fig. S2A). To control
for the possibility that regions outside Alus are longer and thus
possess more than one miRNA target, and as multiplicity of
targets contributes to the miRNA functionality, we repeated
the aforementioned analysis examining only genes with a single
miRNA target. The trend remained highly significant
(P: 7.4e-11, Student’s t—test; Supplementary Fig. S2E).

We next compared the response to overexpression of a given
miRNA between genes that contain its putative binding site only
within Alus and genes that lack such target altogether.
Remarkably, the two groups were found to respond rather in-
distinguishably to the overexpression of the relevant miRNA
(P: 0.3, Student’s t—test; Supplementary Fig. S2B). This suggests

that the majority of potential miRNA target sites within Alu
elements are actually non-functional.

Alus are primate-speciﬁc, and therefore any motif inside an
Alu is by deﬁnition not conserved in mammals. We therefore set
out to rule out the possibility that the lower functionality of
putative miRNA binding sites inside Alus is not unique to
Alus but is rather a reflection of their lack of evolutionary con-
servation. To this end, we compared the effect of Alu—contained
putative miRNA targets to non-conserved targets residing out-
side Alus. As shown in Supplementary Figure S2C and D, this
analysis revealed that miRNA binding sites inside Alus are less
functional even when compared with non-conserved miRNA
binding sites outside Alus (Student’s t—test, P-Values of 4.9e-4
and 0.001, respectively). Hence, the low level of conservation
cannot account for the low functionality of Alu—contained
putative miRNA targets.

The analysis of a comprehensive miRNA overexpression data-
set enables the examination of the various miRNA target attri-
butes and their respective effects on mRNA expression.
Supplementary Figure S2F recapitulates, with the current dataset,
the established knowledge regarding miRNA target characteris-
tics, showing that the most important features are the multiplicity
of sites within a 3/UTR and their conservation. The presence
of an Alu thus appears as an additional important attribute
that should serve in evaluating a miRNA site: a site within an
Alu is typically less functional (Supplementary Fig. S2F).

Smalheiser and TorVik (2006) reported a conserved site within
Alus, which comprises the target of numerous miRNAsi
GCACUU. They suggested that these miRNAs target Alu se-
quences. To test this possibility, we focused on two miRNAs in
the Khan dataset, miR-373 and miR-106 b, which contain this
sequence in their target. Comparing the fold change distributions
in these speciﬁc overexpression experiments, we ﬁnd that the
miRNA targets within Alus are still signiﬁcantly less functional
than the targets outside Alus across various cell lines (Fig. 1E,
P:2.5e-17; Supplementary Fig. S3AeC, P: 0.003, 7.6e-43 and
9.6e-35, respectively, Student’s t-test). Thus, although miRNA
sites within Alus may certainly be functional in many particular
cases, these genome-wide ﬁndings indicate that miRNA targets
within Alus are often less functional.

Realizing that legitimate 7-mer perfect match targets within
Alus are often not functional, we looked for features that
would explain such lack of functionality. Conversely, absence
of such features in exceptional cases may highlight potential
novel functional miRNA targets that were inserted through
Alu retrotransposition.

3.4 Mutually distinct 3’UTR territories of conserved
miRNA targets and Alu repeats

The ﬁrst feature we explored that might explain why miRNA
targets within Alus are often not functional is the location of Alu
insertions within 3/UTRs. It was previously shown that con-
served and functional miRNA targets tend to reside at both
ends of 3/UTRs and less in the UTR’s middle (Grimson et al.,
2007). Figure 2A recapitulates this ﬁnding for relative position
along the 3/UTR, showing that conserved miRNA binding sites
are enriched near the two ends of the 3/UTR. Examining only
3/UTRs longer than 1000 bps, we found that conserved miRNA

according to the percentage of downregulated genes in two groups: genes
with the miRNA target in the middle or in the 3’UTR ends

binding motifs are concentrated in the ﬁrst and last 250 bps of
the UTR and are relatively depleted from the middle section
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). In contrast, non-conserved targets
are evenly distributed throughout the 3/UTRs (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). Reassuringly, this localization appears to have an
interesting functional correlate: Figure 2C shows that predicted
miRNA binding sites near the ends of the 3’UTR tend to be
more functional, i.e. to have a more pronounced response to
overexpression of the miRNA compared with targets in the
middle of the UTR (P:0.01, Student’s t—test).

We next examined the positions of Alu insertions into
3/UTRs. Strikingly, we found that the majority of Alu insertions
have occurred in the middle sections of the 3/UTR, presenting an
almost exact mirror image of the conserved miRNA recognition
motifs’ location (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S4A). These
results suggest that Alu insertions into 3/UTRs during primate
evolution were tolerated, provided that they occurred away from
the two 3’UTR ends. It is tempting to suggest that a reason for
such Alu avoidance from the ends is that those territories are
preserved for critical regulatory interactions, including functional
miRNA binding sites. In contrast, the middle section of the
3/UTRs is proposed to be relatively more depleted of such func-
tional elements and therefore more likely to tolerate genomic
infringements such as Alu insertions.

At this stage, it could be suggested that the functional failure
of Alu-contained putative miRNA binding sites to serve as tar-
gets is merely due to their unfavourable locationiaway from the
ends of the 3/UTR. However, a comparison of genes with puta-
tive miRNA binding sites within Alus to genes with targets only
outside Alus but in the middle of the 3’UTR revealed that the
non-Alu targets in the UTRs’ middle are still more functional
than the targets in Alus (P: 7.4e-10, Student’s t—test;
Supplementary Fig. S4C). Moreover, some Alus were inserted
near 3/UTR ends, and numerous functional conserved miRNA
targets are located in the middle of 3/UTRs (Fig. 2A and B).
Therefore, location within 3/UTR appears to be an important,
but not exclusive, evolutionary constraint on Alu insertion. We
thus turned to examine additional features of Alus that may
allow their insertions into functional regions of 3/UTRs without
altering gene expression.

3.5 Putative miRNA targets in Alus have tight RNA
secondary structure

The RNA structure and folding energy of miRNA targets and
their surroundings are important for their functionality; in par-
ticular, targets located within mRNA regions possessing tight
secondary structure are typically less functional (Hausser et al.,
2009; Kertesz et al., 2007). In agreement with these findings, we
too ﬁnd that genes harbouring a conserved miRNA binding site
at a given location along the 3’UTR tend to have a signiﬁcantly
less tight secondary structure at that region compared with genes
without any conserved miRNA target at that location (Fig. 3A).

Endogenous microRNA targets within Alu elements

 

This appears to hold for all possible locations along the 3/UTR,
including the two ends and the middle section.

As tight structure around miRNA binding sites might provide
an additional feature that reduces the potential regulatory effect
of Alu insertion, we examined the folding energy around targets
inside Alus. Indeed, we found that targets inside Alus tend to
reside within tighter structures, as compared with conserved
miRNA binding sites (Fig. 3B), an observation compatible
with the known high RNA secondary structure content of Alu
repeats (Labuda and Striker, 1989; Okada, 1990). Hence, tight
local secondary structure of some Alus may have allowed their
insertion into legitimate regions without imposing major regula-
tory effects. We note that the RNA folding calculations were
performed here on sequence windows of 100 nucleotidesi
shorter than the length of an Alu elementithus capturing a
tendency of single Alu elements to fold on themselves. On top
of that, two Alus with opposite orientations could form tight
hairpins, thus increasing the actual extent of secondary structure
and hence potentially further augmenting miRNA targeting
avoidance.

The tightness of the secondary structure found around
miRNA targets can also be affected by nucleotide content. In
particular, Grimson et a]. (2007) reported that the AU content
around effective miRNA targets is higher than around less ef-
fective targets. We therefore examined the AU content in the
Vicinity (10 nucleotides upstream plus 10 nucleotides down-
stream) of targets within Alus, and compared it with the AU
content of the most effective miRNA targets within the Khan
dataset. In agreement with Grimson et al., and as shown in
Supplementary Figure SSA, the Vicinity of miRNA targets
within Alus is characterized by a significantly lower AU content
(P<e-300, Student’s t—test). Nevertheless, even when we com-
pared the average fold change only between genes with similar
AU content, targets within Alus were still less functional than
corresponding matched targets outside Alus (Supplementary
Fig. S5B). Thus, even though a lower AU content may well
contribute to a more stable secondary structure in the sur-
roundings of Alu-contained miRNA targets, the poor function-
ality of such targets cannot be solely attributable to the lower
AU content.

3.6 The miRNA targets within Alus might be altered by
RNA editing

Alu sequences are subject to extensive RNA editing
(Athanasiadis et al., 2004; Blow et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2004;
Levanon et al., 2004; Morse et al., 2002), which modiﬁes adeno-
sines (A) to inosines (I) by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA
(ADAR) enzymes. The majority of editing events in human tis-
sues occur within Alus (Barak et al., 2009). As inosines are
recognized as guanosines by many of the molecular machineries
in the cell, such alterations can diminish the complementarity
between a miRNA’s seed and its binding site within Alus, or
introduce novel targets by creating complementarity with the
miRNA’s seed (Borchert et al., 2009).

To interrogate the potential impact of RNA editing on the
recognition of Alu-contained putative miRNA targets, we ﬁrst
singled out those targets that do not contain an A in their
seed-complementary target sequence and therefore cannot be

subject to editing. Of the 18 different miRNA 7-mer target
sequences in the Khan dataset, three were found to have no
A within the 7-mer. These three targets were represented in
eight miRNA overexpression experiments, for which we could
compare between genes that have the miRNA target only inside
or only outside Alus (as described in Section 2). For compari-
son, we had 18 overexpression experiments with A-containing
miRNA targets. RNA editing is an additional layer that may
assist the cell to reduce the effect of Alu insertions on gene
regulation, and therefore we expect that miRNA targets with-
out an A within Alus will be more functional than the ones
with an A.

When examining only genes with putative miRNA binding
sites without A, targets within Alus are moderately less func-
tional than targets outside Alu (P:0.02, Student’s t—test;
Fig. 4A), probably owing to the effects of territory and second-
ary structure discussed earlier in the text. Notably, when we
examined only targets with A, the targets within Alus were
found to be substantially less functional than those outside
Alus (P: 5.8e-6, Student’s t—test; Fig. 4B). This observation sug-
gests that among Alu—contained sites, miRNA targets without A
are more effective than A-containing ones. It is tempting to pro-
pose that this trend is due to the fact that A-containing targets
within Alus are likely to be edited, thereby disrupting the recog-
nition by the cognate miRNA. Thus, RNA editing might consti-
tute an additional feature through which Alu insertions into
mRNAs were tolerated.

3.7 Repeats and miRNA targets in the mouse genome

Transposable elements are active in most animal genomes.
Therefore, introduction of novel miRNA targets Via transpos-
ition can occur in other species as well. Although Alu repeats are
primate speciﬁc, the mouse genome too contains repeats similar
to Alus, namely B1 repeats that belong to the Short Interspersed
Elements family. As in the case of Alus, B1 repeats emerged from
the ancestral 7SL RNA gene (Ullu and Tschudi, 1984). The B1
repeats are less widespread than Alus, comprising only 2.7% of
the mouse genome (Lander et al., 2001; Pruitt et al., 2005) and
are also shorter (~140 bp) (Smalheiser and Torvik, 2006).

In the mouse genome, 8.3% of the genes contain at least one
B1 repeat in their 3/UTR. The 1962 B1 sequences that reside
within 3/UTRs represent 14372 potential miRNA targets (per-
fect 7-mers). Consequently, the potential effect of putative
miRNA targets within B1 repeats is less substantial than that
of Alus in the human genome; it is nonetheless not negligible.
We observed that with regard to their location within the 3/UTR,
mouse B1 repeats show similar trends as the human Alus. B1
repeats tend to avoid the two ends of the 3/UTR, predominantly
the beginning, while the conserved mouse miRNA targets display
an opposite trend of preferential location near the UTR ends
(Supplementary Fig. S6A).

Further, putative miRNA targets within B1 repeat-encoded
mRNAs show tighter local secondary structure (Supplementary
Fig. S6B). The fact that this feature is shared with Alus is prob-
ably explained by the common evolutionary origin of these two
types of repeats (Ullu and Tschudi, 1984).

In conclusion, like Alus in the human genome, B1 insertions
into mouse mRNAs were probably tolerated, provided that they
occur into 3/UTR territories that do not overlap with functional
miRNA targets or that they possess tight secondary structure.

3.8 Lack of binding of the miRNA machinery to Alu-
contained target sites

The compromised functionality of putative miRNA targets
within Alus can be due to a failure of the miRNA machinery
to bind such targets or due to dysfunctionality after binding
occurs. To distinguish between these two possibilities we ana-
lysed data from Ago2-mRNA binding experiments.

Ago2 is part of the Argonaute family of proteins, which are
guided by the mature miRNA to bind the speciﬁc complemen-
tary region of the target mRNA to initiate its silencing (Ender
and Meister, 2010). Therefore, profiling of Ago2-bound mRNA
species could serve as a means to assess how efﬁciently is a given
RNA sequence bound by the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC) machinery.

To specifically and accurately analyse mRNA regions that are
bound by the RISC machinery genome wide, we used
photoactivatable—ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and
immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) data generated by Kishore
et a]. (2011). PAR-CLIP with Ago2 identiﬁes mRNA molecules
that were targeted by miRNAs (Hafner et al., 2010). Typically,
the outputs of PAR-CLIP experiments are short reads of bound
RNA segments, obtained in conjunction with mRNA-Seq profil-
ing of the transcripts expressed in cells exposed to the same con-
ditions. In addition, the identities of the most abundant miRNAs
in the analysed cell population can be deduced directly from the

PAR-CLIP data (Kishore et al., 2011); a total of 10 miRNAs
were identiﬁed as the most abundant within the cells used in this
recent experiment.

To examine the potential functionality of miRNA targets that
reside within Alu elements relative to those residing outside Alus,
we mapped PAR-CLIP reads and annotated them according to
their genomic context. We did not attempt to determine the exact
mapping of each read onto the genome in this analysis (as such
mapping would be particularly challenging with repetitive elem-
ents; see Section 2). Instead, we merely aimed to determine here
whether a read resides within an Alu. Reassuringly, we found
that ~20% of the mapped reads contained a target for one of the
10 miRNAs identiﬁed as most abundant in those cells. Analysing
the mRNA-Seq data, we found that potential targets of all 10 top
miRNAs are highly represented in the transcriptome. Of these, 3
miRNAs, miR-106 a, miR-25 and miR-10, have a high percent-
age of their expressed potential targets within Alus (Fig. 5). As
such, these miRNAs can be used for the comparison of binding
targets within and outside Alus. For instance, miR-106a has
27% of its expressed potential targets within Alus, but strikingly
only 0.61% of its associated reads could actually be mapped to
Alus (P<e-300, HyperGeometric test; Fig. 5). The reads that do
not contain predicted targets for any of the 10 most abundant
miRNAs (~80% of the reads) can serve as a control for
non-speciﬁc binding to Ago2. We found that the percentage of
Ago2-associated reads mapped to Alus is very similar to the ex-
pected Alu content of the transcriptome of these cells. Essentially
similar results were obtained also with the other two miRNAs
(miR-10a, P: 3.8e-4; miR-25, P<e—300; HyperGeometric test;
Fig. 5), supporting the generality of our observations.

Together, these findings provide independent experimental
support to the notion that insertion of Alu-contained miRNA
sites into 3/UTRs was largely tolerated only when they could
escape Ago2 binding. These results further argue that miRNA
targets within Alus are preferentially not associated with Ago2
and the RISC complex, implying that they are strongly disre-
garded by the miRNA machinery. Thus, although our analysis
of the Khan dataset clearly shows that targets within Alus are

Endogenous microRNA targets within Alu elements

 

not effective in mRNA destabilization, the PAR-CLIP analysis
strongly suggests that these targets are not functional in transla-
tion inhibition as well.

4 DISCUSSION

In the present study, we demonstrate that potential miRNA tar-
gets within Alus are largely non-functional and are not bound by
the miRNA machinery. We suggest that insertions of Alus into
mRNAs were tolerated largely when miRNA targets within them
were likely to be less functional.

Despite the strong indications that Alu-contained putative
miRNA target sites do not tend to affect gene expression, there
are clearly cases where such targets within Alus can be func-
tional. In particular, Smalheiser and Torvik (2006) described
many mRNAs that contain Alus in their 3/UTR, within which
there are target sites for dozens of miRNAs. In their study, most
of the miRNAs suggested to target Alus were within the C19MC
cluster (Smalheiser and Torvik, 2006), which is a primate-speciﬁc
cluster that contains many Alu sequences that might have facili-
tated its expansion (Zhang et al., 2007). These miRNAs might
have evolved in coordination with the Alu sequences to create an
effective targeting. Lehnert et a]. (2009) reported that there are a
few miRNAs with >1000 predicted sites per megabase within Alu
sequences and proposed that such miRNAs protect against Alu
transposition. We find that although the potential regulatory
effect of Alus is huge, their actual contribution to regulation of
gene expression by the miRNA machinery might be limited.
Clearly, this does not exclude other regulatory roles of the
miRNA-Alu interplay, such as a role of miRNAs in maintaining
genomic stability by the repression of transposable elements
(Shalgi et al., 2010).

The three features that permit Alu insertions into the 3’UTR
of genes are inherently very different from one another. Mutually
exclusive territories imply an evolutionary mechanism, as it ap-
pears that Alu insertions near 3’UTR ends were selected against.
One intriguing hypothesis is that Alus inserted near the ends of
3/UTRs might have forced important miRNA targets to move
towards the middle of the 3/UTR, where they become less effect-
ive. Another scenario, supported by our findings, is that Alus
near the ends might have introduced new miRNA binding sites
at locations where such targets are likely to be highly functional,
grossly disrupting the conserved regulation of the gene.
Additionally, it is conceivable that insertion of Alus near the
ends of 3/UTRs may be deleterious also for reasons that are
unrelated to miRNA function.

The tight secondary structure presents an inherent feature of
the Alu itselfiAlus have high RNA secondary structure content
(Labuda and Striker, 1989; Okada, 1990), a property that might
have allowed insertion without a major effect on gene regulation,
as miRNA targets are less functional within tight secondary
structure (Kertesz et al., 2007).

The editing mechanism presents another layer, which has the
potential to be regulated at a cellular level, as its impact might
vary greatly among different cell types as a function of their
editing capacity. This could potentially contribute to changes
in the transcriptome during developmental processes, as well as
in response to any internal or external signal that affects editing
efﬁciency. Importantly, levels of ADAR enzymes, which perform

the A-to-I editing, are altered in cancer (Paz et al., 2007). It is
thus tempting to speculate that miRNA targets within Alus
escape editing in cancer cells, leading to an elevation in their
functionality. Such mechanism might contribute in interesting
ways to post-transcriptional deregulation of gene expression pat-
terns in cancer. In addition, RNA editing has the potential to
create new potential miRNA targets, as previously suggested by
Liang and Landweber (2007).

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can also affect the potential of
the miRNA machinery to bind and act on the mRNA. J acobsen
et a]. (2010) showed that the presence of binding motifs for spe-
ciﬁc RBPs within mRNAs can affect the way in which these
mRNAs are regulated by miRNAs for which they contain tar-
gets. Speciﬁcally, mRNAs that were downregulated on miRNA
overexpression were found to be enriched for two U-rich motifs
that bind the protein ELAVL4, whereas mRNAs upregulated in
response to miRNA overexpression were enriched for an
AU—rich element (Jacobsen et al., 2010). We therefore tested
whether such RBP—binding elements may account for the
reduced efficacy of Alu-contained miRNA targets. However,
we could not ﬁnd evidence for a selective contribution of the
three RNA-binding motifs described in Jacobsen et a]. to the
differential efﬁcacy of targets inside versus outside Alus.
Rather, we found that these motifs are evenly distributed in
mRNAs with the target inside, or outside of Alus, and thus
their existence or depletion cannot explain the lack of function-
ality of miRNA targets within Alus. Yet, the existence of other
RBP—binding motifs that are unequally present in these two types
of target mRNAs cannot be ruled out and should be the subject
of future analyses.

We also examined the potential for combined effects of the
various features on Alu-contained miRNA targets. Supple-
mentary Figure S8 presents a Venn diagram addressing the char-
acteristics applicable to each miRNA target inside Alu for all
conserved mammalian miRNAs. Most of the targets appear to
use more than one feature, supporting the conjecture that an
interaction between two or more features is needed to reduce
dramatically the target’s functionality. Importantly, consistent
with the earlier suggestion of Smalheiser and Torvik (2006),
there are 416 miRNA targets that might be functional as they
are located in the ends of the 3/UTR, have a loose secondary
structure and cannot be edited. When looking at all targets
within Alus, which could potentially escape the location and
structure criteria, we find ~8000 targets. Among the top 10 tar-
gets are two with the GCACUU site, which appear in many
Alus, and comprises the target of numerous miRNAs, as
discussed by Smalheiser and Torvik (2006). However, in a ran-
domized simulation, its appearances in the escaping targets were
not found statistically signiﬁcant. Our ability to identify at least
some of these characteristics enables to single out the more
relevant miRNA targets and subject them to future functional
studies.

Abstract

Summary: ClusPro is a heavily used protein—protein docking server based on the fast Fouriertrans—
form (FFT) correlation approach. While FFT enables global docking, accounting for pairwise dis—
tance restraints using penalty terms in the scoring function is computationally expensive. We use a
different approach and directly select low energy solutions that also satisfy the given restraints. As
expected, accounting for restraints generally improves the rank of near native predictions, while re—
taining or even improving the numerical efficiency of FFT based docking.

1 Introduction

The fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation approach has proved
to be very useful for macromolecular docking. The major advantage
of the method is the extremely fast evaluation of scoring functions,
enabling global systematic sampling of the entire conformational
space defined by the relative orientations of two molecules.
Although the scoring function must be expressed as a sum of cor-
relation functions (Katchalski—Katzir et (11., 1992), it is possible to
represent complex energy functions, based on molecular mechanics
and including solvation terms, in a form suitable for FFT. FFT-based
methods such as ZDOCK (Chen et (11., 2003), GRAMM
(Tovchigrechko and Vakser, 2006), PIPER (Kozakov et (11., 2006),
DOT (Mandell et (11., 2001) and DOCK/PIERR (Viswanath et (11.,
2014) consistently perform well both as protocols of individual
groups and as automatic servers. In particular, during the latest
rounds of the blind protein docking experiment CAPRI (Lensink
and Wodak, 2010, 2013), performance of our docking server
ClusPro (Comeau et (11., 2004), based on the PIPER program, was
comparable with top human predictor groups (Kozakov et (11.,
2013). The server is heavily used: by December 2015 the Cluspro
2.0 website registered over 15 000 unique user IPs, and completed

almost 150 000 docking calculations, currently adding about 5000
per month. Models built by the server have been reported in over
400 publications.

In spite of the significant progress, docking generally needs to be
complemented by experimental validation. The main reason is that
the current scoring functions are not accurate enough for finding the
best models among the ones generated by the sampling. Thus, add-
itional information can be very useful for improving the reliability
of structure determination. Accordingly, ClusPro has the option to
apply extra attraction terms to residues that are a priori known to
be in the interface. Conversely, repulsion terms are applied to resi-
dues that are not expected to be in the interface. However, what
ClusPro was lacking so far was the ability to define distance re-
straints between pairs of atoms or residues. Such restraints can be
derived, e.g. from NMR Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) experi-
ments or by chemical crosslinking. The use of restraints is central to
the popular High Ambiguity Driven biomolecular DOCKing
(HADDOCK) server (Dominguez et (11., 2003), which incorporates
the interaction restraints into the scoring function to guide the
search toward regions of the conformational space in which the re-
straints are satisfied.

While the extra terms in the scoring function due to the restraints
do not significantly increase the computational burden if the sam—
pling is based on Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics algorithms, a
similar approach is very costly when used with FFT based sampling.
The problem is that each pairwise restraint in the scoring function
requires a new correlation function term, and thus an additional
Fourier transform, thereby reducing the numerical efficiency of the
method. Thus, it is not surprising that none of the successful FFT—
based docking programs has the option of accounting for pairwise
restraints. However, since FFT performs global sampling, there is no
need for guiding the search toward feasible regions. Based on this
observation, we solve the problem by directly selecting low energy
solutions that also satisfy the restraints. As will be shown, this
implies that frequently only portions of conformational space needs
to be examined, and hence the computational efforts can actually be
reduced. A further advantage is that the scoring function is not af—
fected, and thus we retain the favorable properties of the ClusPro
server, validated in many rounds of the CAPRI docking experiment.
We demonstrate the method using both simulated and experimen—
tally determined distance restraints.

2 Methods

A pairwise distance restraint can be defined by two sets of atoms, S1
and S2 and a distance range, dmin to dmax. The restraint is considered
satisfied if there are at least one atom in S1 and at least one atom in
S2 such that the distance between them falls in this range. While the
implementation allows for arbitrary sets of atoms to be used to de—
fine a restraint, most frequently these involve a single atom or resi—
due on each side of the interface. Given multiple restraints, users
may want to require a certain number of restraints out of a group to
be satisfied. In addition, restraints may be based on sources with
varying reliability, requiring different cutoff values. Our implemen—
tation allows for grouping restraints into restraint groups, and re—
straint groups into restraint sets. Restraint groups are considered
satisfied when more than a user specified number of restraints in the
group are satisfied, and a restraint set is satisfied when more than a
user specified number of its groups are satisfied. We have developed
a Javascript Object Notation (JSON) based file format for specifying
groups of restraints used by our restraint library, as well a script for
converting data in the NOE format into our JSON format. A full de—
scription of the file format is provided in the Supplementary Data.

Docking is performed using PIPER, which samples all transla—
tions and rotations of a ligand protein with respect to a receptor pro—
tein. When a restraint set is provided, PIPER will only report
solutions that satisfy the restraints. We note that an FFT based
approach has been reported for visualizing such regions of the con—
formational space. (van Zundert and Bonvin, 2015). To do this effi—
ciently, for each rotation we first generate the set of translations that
satisfy each individual restraint, called the feasible translation set for
the particular restraint. We then consider the intersection of feasible
translation sets for the restraints in each restraint group, and select
the translations that appear more often than the cutoff for the re—
straint group. The selected feasible translation sets for each restraint
group are merged in a similar way to generate the feasible transla—
tion set for an entire restraint set.

We note that providing restraints can actually decrease the run—
ning times by using the restraint set to generate a feasible translation
set for each rotation. For each feasible translation the van der Waals
interaction energy is computed, and it is used to filter out transla—
tions that result in unacceptable clashes. If there are no feasible

translations leading to an acceptable van der Waals energy, the rota—
tion is skipped and no other energy terms are evaluated. In practice,
this often results in skipping detailed energy calculation for the ma—
jority of the rotations. When the cost of generating the feasible
translations is less than the cost of evaluating the additional energy
terms, fast rotation skipping results in overall speedup. After select—
ing the solutions that satisfy the restraints, 1000 structures with the
lowest PIPER energies are clustered and minimized to remove steric
overlaps as customary in ClusPro (Kozakov et al., 2013).

3 Examples of docking with restraints

We first demonstrated the method using simulated distance re—
straints for a large set of complexes and using different requirements
for the number of restraints to be satisfied (see Supporting
Material). Here, we present two examples of docking problems with
restraints based on experimental data, with details also given as
Supporting Material. The first example is constructing the phos—
phoryl transfer complex between the signal transducing proteins
HPr and IIAGlucose (E2A) of the Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyru—
vate:sugar phosphotransferase system, starting from the free form
protein structures using 20 distance restraints based on intermolecu—
lar NOE measurements (Wang et al., 2000). This problem was also
studied using HADDOCK, defining a set of Ambiguous Interaction
Restraints (AIRs) based on the NOE data (Dominguez et al., 2003).
We compared the results of docking without any restraint to the re—
sults of docking using the restraint set. ClusPro works very well for
this problem even without any restraint, as the center of the second
ranked cluster has interface RMSD (iRMSD) of 3.78  from the na—
tive state. Accounting for the restraints further improves the result,
and the center of the largest cluster is shifted to 2.88  iRMSD
(Supplementary Fig. 58).

The second example is based on the study of the recognition of
chHSc and the nucleosome by the Emil/Ring1b ubiquitin ligase
complex (Bentley et al., 2011). Bmi1 and Ring1b are critical com—
ponents of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that binds
and ubiquitinates the nucleosome in histone H2A on Lys119. We
note that the docking of the chHSc subunit of the PRC1 complex
to histone H2A of the nucleosome was target 95 of the CAPRI
docking experiment (Lensink and Wodak, 2013). Restraints were
generated after examining the evidence available from the litera—
ture. The catalytically competent geometry requires that Cys85 of
chHSc be located relatively close to the H2A acceptor lysine,
Lys119, and hence we created one restraint that had to be satisfied
between these two residues. The required range, 0—8 A, was fairly
large, because these residues were located in flexible tail regions of
the proteins. Based on mutation data Lys97 and Arg98 of Ring1b
interact with the histone in the nucleosome, and hence we created
a second restraint group with multiple restraints, from Lys97 to
the set of surface residues on the histone. In this second group we
only require one of the restraints to be satisfied, since we do not
know which of the residues on the surface of the histone interact
with Lys97. In this case the best structure without restraints has
the iRMSD of 38.68  whereas docking using this restraint set pro—
duced a near—native pose ranked 2 with the iRMSD of 4.53 
(Supplementary Fig. S9).

4 Conclusions

We describe implementation of pairwise restraints in the FFT sam—
pling approach. Unlike other approaches that bias the energy

function to steer the docking towards satisfying the restraints, we
leave the energy function intact and restrain the search space. Thus,
the restraints provide additional information but docking results can
be obtained without them. Users can vary the confidence in the re—
straints by varying the number of restraints to be satisfied, and by
specifying restraints in groups. The approach generally improves
docking results even with relatively spurious restraints. The method
is freely available as part of the ClusPro protein docking server.

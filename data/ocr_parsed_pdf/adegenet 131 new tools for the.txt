ABSTRACT

Summary: While the R software is becoming a standard for the
analysis of genetic data, classical population genetics tools are being
challenged by the increasing availability of genomic sequences.
Dedicated tools are needed for harnessing the large amount of
information generated by next-generation sequencing technologies.
We introduce new tools implemented in the adegenet 1.3-1
package for handling and analyzing genome-wide single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) data. Using a bit-level coding scheme for SNP
data and parallelized computation, adegenet enables the analysis
of large genome-wide SNPs datasets using standard personal
computers.

Availability: adegenet 1.3-1 is available from CRAN:
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adegenet/. Information and
support including a dedicated forum of discussion can be found
on the adegenet website: http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/.
adegenet is released with a manual and four tutorials totalling
over 300 pages of documentation, and distributed under the GNU
General Public Licence (32).

1 INTRODUCTION

The free software R (R Development Core Team, 2011) is becoming
a standard for the analysis of genetic data, offering a wealth
of packages dedicated to population genetics (Jombart, 2008;
Paradis, 2010), phylogenetics (Paradis et al., 2004; Schliep, 2011)
or genome-wide association studies (Aulchenko et al., 2007;
Clayton and Leung, 2007). Until recently, classical genetic marker
data such as microsatellites could be analyzed using standard tools
and personal computers. However, the increasing availability of
genomic sequence data has challenged both the tools and the
ressources needed to carry such analyses. While some speciﬁc
packages have been developed for human association studies
(Aulchenko et al., 2007; Clayton and Leung, 2007), more general
tools for the analysis of the genetic structure of biological
populations are needed. In this article, we introduce new tools
implemented in the R package adegenet (Jombart, 2008) which

allow large genomic datasets (e.g. hundreds of individuals typed for
hundreds of thousands SNPs) to be analyzed using stande personal
computers. As an illustration, we show how a new implementation
of the discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)
(Jombart et al., 2010) can be used to identify structuring alleles from
genomic data with minimum computing resources.

2 DESCRIPTION

The sheer size of genomic sequence data often precludes their
analysis using standard personal computers. While studies focusing
on genetic diversity can reduce the size of the analyzed datasets by
considering biallelic SNPs only, the subsequent amount of data often
remains considerable and can require prohibitive amounts of random
access memory (RAM). To address this issue, we implemented
a new data representation which codes each biallelic SNP using
a single bit. While such coding is not readily possible in R, the
new class genlight internally codes chunks of 8 SNPs using
a single byte, resulting in drastic compression of the data. For
instance, 50 individuals genotyped for 1000 000 SNPs classically
coded as characters would require ~380 MB of RAM, as opposed
to 6MB using genlight objects. This new coding scheme is also
about eight times more compact than other available classes for
representing SNP data such as DNAbin (Paradis et al., 2004) or
snp .matrix (Clayton and Leung, 2007). A further advantage of
genlight is the ability to accomodate any ploidy in the data, even
allowing for the ploidy to vary across individuals. The features of
the class genlight are fully documented in a tutorial accessible
from R by typing vignette ( "adegenet—genomics " ).

While the bit-level coding of SNP data is undoubtedly memory
efﬁcient, it also makes the internal structure of the objects far
more complex. Considerable efforts have been made to simplify the
handling and analysis of genlight objects, whose manipulation
is very close to matrices of individual allele frequencies. The
entire genlight class has been replicated in C, which allowed
for optimizing recurrent operations such as conversions from and
to integers. Dedicated functions (‘accessors’) facilitate the access
and modiﬁcation of information while preventing the user from
interacting directly with the complex internal structure of the
objects. As a result, genlight objects act as ‘black boxes’ which
resemble matrices of individual allele frequencies, albeit storing
the information more efﬁciently. Basic ﬁinctions such as mean and
variance of SNP frequencies have also been implemented in order
to facilitate the development of future dedicated tools.

Beyond the need for efﬁcient data storage, the analysis of
genome-wide SNP data also requires signiﬁcant computing power.
Fortunately, most computers now possess processors with multiple
cores, which can be used to partition important tasks into several
smaller operations executed simultaneously by the different cores.
This approach can lead to appreciable reductions in computational
time and is most useful for analyzing large datasets. By default,
most procedures implemented for genlight objects achieve
parallelization using the package multicore (currently available
on linux and MacOSX systems), although this can be disabled by
the user. For instance, the new implementations of PCA (function
g1 Pca) and DAPC (dapc, see example) by default use compiled
C code and parallelized computations, while never requiring more
than two genomes to be represented as integers at a time. In some
cases, this approach turns out to be even faster than other classical
implementations of PCA (Supplementary Table 51).

Data interoperability can be a critical issue when large datasets are
considered. Therefore, we made sure that genome-wide SNP data
could be imported from stande formats into genlight objects
as simply as possible. First, genlight objects can be created
from lists or matrices of individual allele frequencies. Data can also
be imported from the widely used software PLINK (Purcell et al.,
2007), which has deﬁned a stande format for storing diploid
SNP data. Alternatively, data can also be imported from adegenet’s
own format (‘ . snp’ ﬁles), which can accomodate any degree of
ploidy and can store any meta-information such as individual group
membership or positions of the SNPs. Finally, SNPs can also be
directly extracted from aligned DNA sequences stored as FASTA
ﬁles. Importantly, all these functions allow for processing the data
by chunks of a few individuals, which allows for minimizing the
RAM required for reading the data in.

3 EXAMPLE

We illustrate how a new implementation of DAPC for genlight
objects can be used to identify structuring alleles from genome-
wide SNP data. After loading the package, we simulate l 001 000
SNPs for two groups of 50 individuals using ngim. The ﬁrst
1 000 000 SNPs have similar distributions for both groups, whereas
these distributions differ in the last 1000 SNPs.

> library(adegenet)
> x <— ngim(n.ind=lOO, n.snp.nonstruc=le6,
n.snp.struc=le3)

We then apply DAPC to these data, choosing to retain 20 principal
components in the prior dimension-reduction step.

> dapcl <— dapc(x, n.pca=20)

Despite defavourable noise/signal ratio, DAPC discriminates very
neatly the two groups of individuals (Fig. la). Interestingly, it
also clearly identiﬁes the structuring SNPs (Fig. 1b). Despite its
simplicity, this example suggests that DAPC could be a useﬁil tool
for identifying structuring alleles from genome-wide SNP data.

4 CONCLUSION

adegenet 1.3-] provides new tools for the analysis of genome-wide
SNP data using standard personal computers. As the availability of
genomic data increases faster than computing resources, efﬁcient
data representation and parallel computation represent viable
alternatives to the mere increase of raw computing power. As such,
we hope that the new class genlight and the associated tools
will make a signiﬁcant contribution to taking population genetics
studies into the genomic era and encourage the development of new
dedicated methods.

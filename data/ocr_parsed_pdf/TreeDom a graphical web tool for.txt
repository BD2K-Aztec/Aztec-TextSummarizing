Abstract

Summary: We present TreeDom, a web tool for graphically analysing the evolutionary history of
domains in multi—domain proteins. Individual domains on the same protein chain may have distinct
evolutionary histories, which is important to grasp in order to understand protein function. For
instance, it may be important to know whether a domain was duplicated recently or long ago, to
know the origin of inserted domains, or to know the pattern of domain loss within a protein family.
TreeDom uses the Pfam database as the source of domain annotations, and displays these on a
sequence tree. An advantage of TreeDom is that the user can limit the analysis to N sequences that
are most similar to a query, or provide a list of sequence IDs to include. Using the Pfam alignment
of the selected sequences, a tree is built and displayed together with the domain architecture of

each sequence.

1 Introduction

Multi—domain proteins have evolved by insertions or deletions of
distinct protein domains. Tracing the history of a certain domain
combination can be important for functional annotation of multi—
domain proteins, and for understanding the function of individual
domains (Forslund and Sonnhammer, 2012). In order to analyze the
evolutionary history of the domains in multi—domain proteins it is
desirable to inspect the sequence tree for each domain together with
the domain architecture of the sequences.

A few graphical tools exist that can combine trees with domain
architectures. NIFAS (Storm and Sonnhammer, 2001) is a Java app—
let based on outdated Java libraries that does not work in many cur—
rent browsers. Although it is a general—purpose tool, it has mainly
been used as a plugin to the Pfam database (Finn et (11., 2014), but
this is no longer supported. Another discontinued tool is the
TreeDomViewer (Alako et (11., 2006). DoMosaics (Moore et (11.,
2014) is a Java applet package that includes a panel with a tree and
unproportional domain architectures. However, it requires substan—
tial manual work to produce such a view for a given case, which

limits its usability. The PhylomeDB database (Huerta—Cepas et (11.,
2014) for complete catalogs of gene phylogenies has a similar
graphic display that also contains features other than domains. It is
however limited to the phylogenies in PhylomeDB and not for gen—
eral purpose. The same is true for the InParanoid database
(Sonnhammer and Ostlund, 2015) that shows domain architectures
and tree for proteins in an orthologue group. Finally, the TreeFam
database (Schreiber et (11., 2014) of animal phylogenetic trees has a
tree and domain architecture graphic which is built on a reusable
BioJS.Tree (Yachdav et (11., 2015) JavaScript component.

2 Implementation

We created a website called TreeDom that lets the user choose a pro—
tein family and sequences from Pfam, then fetches them, computes a
tree and displays it together with the Pfam domain architectures. It
uses the BioJS.Tree component, version 1.0.0, for the graphical dis—
play. The back—end is implemented as PHP scripts to enter the query
and a C ++ program to fetch the alignment and domain

architectures from Pfam’s Web services, and to compute the tree.
The tree is built using the Neighbour—Joining (NJ) method with un—
corrected distances and is rooted at the midpoint, i.e. where the sum
of the branch lengths of the two subtrees branching out from the
root are as close as possible.

Because protein families are very large nowadays, often with
thousands of members, it is not practical to show all of them. The
TreeDom website thus offers several ways to extract the sequences
of interest only. It is based on the Pfam database and can be run in
two modes:

Single query:

' Input: 1 family ID; 1 member query sequence ID, N
' Build NJ tree for N closest sequences using Pfam’s alignment

Multiple query:

' Input: 1 family ID; N member sequence IDs
' Build NJ tree for all provided sequences using Pfam’s alignment

TreeDom is close in functionality to NIFAS. The main advan—
tages of TreeDom are that it works in any web browser, and that it
can limit the analysis to N sequences using two different methods.
Such input limitation was never implemented for NIFAS which
therefore could not handle families with more than ~500 members.
A major drawback with NIFAS was that the applet only showed one
simultaneous tree, but in order to analyze the evolution of different
domains it is essential to compare their trees visually. This drawback
is removed by TreeDom by running it in multiple web browser
windows.

TreeDom was optimized for speed by a C ++ implementation of
the back—end which completes within a few seconds for most fami—
lies when asking for less than 50 sequences. The two time consum—
ing steps are fetching (i) the alignment and (ii) the domain
architectures from the Pfam server. The former can be sped up by
choosing a representative proteome dataset (Chen et (11., 2011).
These redundancy—reduced datasets also promote sequence diversity
in the tree and are usually preferable over the full alignments.

3 Example

An example of domain architecture evolution analysis of NUDIX
hydrolases is shown in Figure 1. The aim is to look for domain
transfer, domain loss and domain duplication. Starting from
NUD13_HUMAN, most of the closest homologs have the same do—
main architecture [NUDIX—like]—[zf—NADH—PPase]—[NUDIX] but
some exceptions exist where the NUDIX—like or zf—NADH—PPase
domains are missing or truncated. Only one of these,
HZSB95_TAKRU, is annotated as a fragment, suggesting that the
NUDIX domain is more essential than the other two domains.
Mammals and oviparous animals are fairly well separated clades in
these trees. The coelacanth which lies in between is unusual because
has two proteins ("'_LATCH). The NUDIX—like domains of these
proteins have diverged about as much as between species, suggesting
an old duplication (Fig. 1b), whereas the NUDIX domains (Fig. 1a)
are almost identical. Possible explanations for this are gene conver—
sion, or that the gene duplication is recent but the NUDIX—like do—
main is not under selection. Among the shown species there is no
evidence for domain transfer or domain duplication. In fact, 18 of
the 20 closest homologs to the NUDIX and NUDIX—like domains
are the same, suggesting that this domain architecture is very stable
in vertebrates.

Pfam entries (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformaticsonline.)

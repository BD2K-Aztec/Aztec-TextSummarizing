ABSTRACT

Motivation: Probabilistic approaches for inferring transcription
factor binding sites (T FBSs) and regulatory motifs from DNA
sequences have been developed for over two decades. Previous
work has shown that prediction accuracy can be significantly
improved by incorporating features such as the competition of
multiple transcription factors (T F3) for binding to nearby sites,
the tendency of TFBSs for co-regulated TFs to cluster and
form cis-regulatory modules and explicit evolutionary modeling of
conservation of TFBSs across orthologous sequences. However,
currently available tools only incorporate some of these features, and
significant methodological hurdles hampered their synthesis into a
single consistent probabilistic framework.

Results: We present MotEvo, a integrated suite of Bayesian
probabilistic methods for the prediction of TFBSs and inference of
regulatory motifs from multiple alignments of phylogenetically related
DNA sequences, which incorporates all features just mentioned. In
addition, MotEvo incorporates a novel model for detecting unknown
functional elements that are under evolutionary constraint, and a
new robust model for treating gain and loss of TFBSs along a
phylogeny. Rigorous benchmarking tests on ChlP-seq datasets show
that MotEvo’s novel features significantly improve the accuracy of
TFBS prediction, motif inference and enhancer prediction.

1 INTRODUCTION

What the sequence speciﬁcities of different transcription factors
(TFs) are and where in the genome their transcription factor binding
sites (TFBSs) occur remain central questions in gene regulation.
For over two decades, a large number of computational methods
has been developed that aim to support answering such questions,
see e.g. Bulyk (2003); Hannenhalli (2008) for reviews. Although

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

much progress has been made, it remains highly challenging to
obtain accurate computational TFBS predictions, especially on a
genome-wide scale. For example, although from a biophysical point
of view identical sequence segments should have equal afﬁnity
for the TF, one typically ﬁnds that only a small fraction of the
sequences with high binding afﬁnity act as ﬁmctional TFBSs. That
is, TFBS ﬁmctionality is context dependent and thus researchers
have searched for additional features that are predictive for the
functionality of putative sites.

One approach that has proven particularly fruitful is comparative
genomic analysis of the conservation of putative TFBSs across
related species, i.e. putative TFBSs that are highly conserved
are generally more likely to be ﬁmctional. A large number of
approaches for incorporating conservation information has been
proposed including several simple ad hoc methods, e.g. Kellis et (11.
(2003), but it has become clear that highest performance is obtained
by methods that use explicit evolutionary models for the evolution
of TFBSs along a phylogeny (Hawkins et (11., 2009; Moses et (11.,
2004; Siddharthan et (11., 2005). As a consequence, there has been
considerable interest in extending methods for regulatory motif
ﬁnding and TFBS prediction to include such explicit phylogenetic
models. For example, the well-known Gibbs sampling (Lawrence
et (11., 1993) and expectation—maximization strategies (Bailey and
Elkan, 1994) for ab initio motif ﬁnding have been extended to
methods that work on multiple alignments of orthologous sequences
and use explicit evolutionary models (Siddharthan et (11., 2005;
Sinha et (11., 2004).

Beyond conservation information, other features have also proven
highly useful in improving the accuracy of TFBS prediction. For
example, especially in higher eukaryotes, ﬁmctional TFBSs often
come in clusters where multiple binding sites for a small subset of
TFs co-occur in close proximity to each other (Davidson, 2001).
Several methods were developed that, instead of looking for TFBSs
for one TF at a time, explicitly look for clusters of sites for a
collection of TFs. These methods have been especially successful in
identifying cis-regulatory modules that are distal to their target gene
(Frith et (11., 2001; Rajewsky et (11., 2002). It has also proven useﬁil to
take into account the contribution of many weak binding sites and the
competitive binding of multiple TFs to a DNA sequence by explicitly
considering all possible conﬁgurations of non-overlapping binding
sites using a dynamic programming procedure, e.g. Rajewsky et (11.
(2002); Roider et (11. (2007); Wasson and Hartemink (2009).

RArnold et al.

 

However, currently these methodologies are spread over multiple
computational tools each of which only implements some of these
methods. For example, the methods for ﬁnding cis-regulatory
modules have been extended to analyze pairs of aligned species
(Sinha et (11., 2003) but not to general multiple alignments
and phylogenetic relationships. Other methods can only make
predictions for one TF at a time, ignoring the competitive binding
of multiple TFs [e.g. Moses et (11. (2004); Sinha et (11. (2004)] and
the methods that incorporate sophisticated models for explicitly
considering all possible binding conﬁgurations of multiple TFs
cannot incorporate conservation information [e.g. Wasson and
Hartemink (2009)]. Beyond this, as we show below, current methods
that incorporate explicit evolutionary models make several implicit
assumptions that cause ‘pathologies’ that signiﬁcantly affect their
performance.

Here we present a computational tool, MotEvo, that integrates
a suite of Bayesian probabilistic methods for the prediction
of regulatory sites and motifs on multiple alignments of
phylogenetically related sequences. MotEvo not only implements
and extends the ﬁmctionality of many of the tools and methods
mentioned in the introduction into a single integrated method, it also
incorporates a number of new features that address the ‘pathologies’
that current methods suffer from, as we explicitly demonstrate
below.

2 METHODS

MotEvo takes as input either sequences from a single species or multiple
alignments of orthologous sequences from several species, a collection of one
or more position-speciﬁc weight matrices (WMS), and a phylogenetic tree
relating the species. The user designates one of the species as the ‘reference
species” and MotEvo can then be asked to provide the following.

0 Posterior probabilities for a TFBS for each possible WM to occur at
each position in the input sequences of the reference species.

The probability, at each position, for an unknown functional element
(UFE) to occur, i.e. a TFBS for an unknown motif not contained in
the input set.

0 The estimated site densities for each WM and for UFES (possibly
ﬁtted to the data).

0 Updated versions of the WMs (ﬁtted to the data).

Log-likelihood ratio scores, at each position, for the occurrence of
cis-regulatory modules containing TFBSs for the input motifs.

We now discuss the methods that MotEvo uses to calculate these quantities.

2.1 Binding site conﬁgurations

We ﬁrst introduce some notation. We denote by {S} a collection of multiple
alignments of sequences, by S an individual multiple alignment (or a segment
from such an alignment) and by s an individual sequence or sequence
segment. To indicate the segment of length 1 from sequence s, starting at
position (i+ 1) we use the notation sw] , and similarly SW] indicates columns
(i + 1) through (i +1) of the multiple alignment S. Column numbers are
always counted with respect to the position in the reference sequence. As in
most approaches, we assume that nucleotides at different positions in TFBSs
are statistically independent and use position-speciﬁc WMs to represent TF
binding speciﬁcities. We denote a collection of WMs by {w} and a single
WM from the set by w. The weight matrix entry w; denotes the probability
that nucleotide 01 occurs at position i of a binding site for WM w.

MotEvo considers all ways in which conﬁgurations of TFBSs (Fig. 1)
for the WMs {w} can be assigned to the sequences of the reference species.

Fig. 2. A single hypothesized TFBS for CTCF on a segment of the multiple
alignment. For each sequence s, the species from which it derives is shown on
the right, and its WM score is shown on the left. The species with WM score
larger than zero are selected (red sequences), the subtree involving these
species of the full phylogenetic tree (red subtree of the black tree on the
right) is obtained and the probability of the selected sequences is calculated
under an evolutionary model that incorporates selective constraints set by the
WM. A sequence logo (Schneider and Stephens, 1990) of the CTCF motif is
shown below the alignment.

To explain how MotEvo calculates probabilities of possible conﬁgurations,
we ﬁrst explain how MotEvo scores a single hypothesized TFBS.

2.2 Probabilities under the evolutionary model

Figure 2 shows a single hypothesized site for the CTCF motif from the
TFBS conﬁguration of Figure 1. MotEvo calculates a probability ratio
P(S |w, T) / P(S lb, T) for observing this multiple alignment segment assuming
that the sequences are evolving under constraints set by the WM w and
assuming that the sequences are evolving ‘neutrally’ under a background
model 1), given the phylogenetic tree T. In contrast to most algorithms that
implement explicit phylogenetic models, e.g. Moses et a1. (2004), MotEvo
takes into account that functional TFBSs may only occur in a subset of the
species. Sites may either have been truly lost or gained in some species during
evolution, or sites may appear to have been lost as a consequence of errors
in the multiple alignments. After experimenting with several procedures for
treating these possibilities, including explicit models that incorporate rates
of gain and loss of sites along different branches of the tree, we found that
the most robust results are obtained using the following species selection
procedure.

We follow the generally made assumption that TFs bind DNA in a
ﬁxed conﬁguration, so that TFBSS for a single TF have a ﬁxed length.
Consequently, only species that are gaplessly aligned with respect to
the reference can have an orthologous TFBS at the same location in
the alignment. For example, in Figure 2 the alignment implies that no
orthologous site appears in dog. For every species that is gaplessly aligned
relative to the reference, MotEvo calculates the probability of its sequence

s under the WM and under a background model b. The probability P(slw)
of a sequence segment s under the WM w is simply given by the product of
WM-components, i.e.

l
P(siw)=]_[w;i, (1)
[’21
where l is the length of the WM and s, is the nucleotide occurring at position
i in sequence s.

MotEvo allows for a variety of background models. In the simplest model,
there are four parameters be, representing the probabilities for a nucleotide 01
to occur at a background position. MotEvo also allows k-th order background
models in which the probability of a nucleotide depends on the k preceding
nucleotides, i.e. 4k+1 conditional probabilities P(.si|.si_1.si_2...si_k) that are
estimated from the input sequences by default. For the simple single-
nucleotide background model, P(slb) is given by replacing the WM entries
wit. with the corresponding background probabilities by, in Equation (1), and
analogously for the higher order models.

We refer to the log-ratio log[P(s|w)/P(s|b)] as the WM score of sequence
s. For the species selection procedure, MotEvo selects all species for which
the WM score is larger than zero (the red sequences in Fig. 2). The key
assumption that MotEvo now makes is that, whatever the reason is for the
apparent loss of the TFBS from certain species, they should not contribute
to the evolutionary evidence for a TFBS to occur at this position in the
reference species. Speciﬁcally, we obtain the subtree T’ that is deﬁned by
the subset of ‘red’ species ( indicated in Fig. 2) and replace the probability
ratio P(Slw, T)/P(S|b, T) by the one obtained using only this subtree, i.e. by
P(Slw,T’)/P(S|b,T’). This ensures that the ‘black’ sequences in Fig. 2 do
not contribute to the ratio P(S |w, T) / P(S lb, T).

The probability ratio P(Slw,T)/P(S|b,T) is the product of independent
contributions from the individual alignment columns, i.e.

P(Slw, T) ’ P(Silwi, T) (2)
P(Slb,T) ‘ﬁl P(S,|b,T) ’
where wi denotes the i-th WM column.

Imagine an alignment column that is evolving under the constraints set
by WM column wi and consider one branch of the phylogenetic tree T.
Distances (1 along the branches of T are measured by the number of expected
substitutions per neutrally evolving site. The key evolutionary quantities are
the probabilities P(c>1|/3,wi ,d) that, when evolving under WM column wi
along a branch of length d, a base )3 evolves into a base 01. MotEvo uses a
F81 model (Felsenstein, 1981). In this model, the transition probabilities are
given by

P(aiﬁ.wi.d>=6..te-d+w;(1—e-d). (3)

Although it is straightforward to implement more sophisticated evolutionary
models, such as the model of Halpern and Bruno (1998) in practice the
F81 model behaves very similarly. We chose the F81 model for consistency
with the UFE model calculations, which require the F81 model to be
computationally tractable (see below).

The probability P(S, lwi , T) is given by multiplying the probabilities
P(ozlﬁ,wi,T) for the transitions at each of the branches of the tree, setting
01 to the corresponding nucleotide for branches leading to the leafs of the
tree, and summing over the unknown nucleotides at all internal nodes of
the tree. To calculate the sum over the nucleotides at the internal nodes, we
use recursion relations introduced by Felsenstein (1981) (see Supplementary
Materials for details).

For the single nucleotide background model, the probability P(Slb, T) is
calculated entirely analogously, i.e. simply replacing the WM column wi with
the column of background frequencies 1) in the above equations. One novel
feature of MotEvo is that it allows the use of higher order background models
in a phylogenetic setting by estimating the sequence context at internal nodes
by averaging over their descendants in the tree (see Supplementary Materials
for details).

Fig. 3. A small segment of a multiple alignment of orthologous mammalian
sequences. The stars at the bottom of the alignment indicate columns that
are perfectly conserved across all six species. A hypothetical binding site
for the SRF motif is indicated (blue box) and the WM scores are shown for
each of the sequences s. Without the UFE model, MotEvo assigns a posterior
probability of 0.97 for a site for SRF to occur at this position, whereas with
the UFE this probability drops to 0.01.

2.3 Unknown functional elements

Even though the number of TFs for which WM models are available
is increasing steadily, the sequence speciﬁcity of the large majority of
TFs is still unknown for most model organisms. Consequently, within the
input alignments, there are likely many binding sites for TFs that are
not represented by the WMs in our set {w}. Moreover, these TFBSs will
often show signiﬁcant evolutionary conservation, i.e. much more than can
be expected under the background model and this can have undesirable
consequences, as illustrated in Figure 3.

In this example, a TFBS for the SRF motif is predicted with high
probability, despite the fact that the sequences show very poor matches to
the WM (with the exception of mouse). The reason for this pathological
behavior is that algorithms that do not explicitly take into account that UFEs
may occur in the input sequences, are forced to choose at each position
of the alignment between assuming that the alignment segment contains a
TFBS for one of the WMs in the input set, or that the alignment segment
contains neutrally evolving sequences. Given a segment that is much more
conserved than can be expected under neutral evolution, such algorithms
may thus assign a high posterior to a site for WM w occurring, even when
the sequences in the segment poorly match the WM.

To avoid such spurious predictions, MotEvo explicitly takes into account
that the input alignments will contain well-conserved segments for motifs
other than those in our input set {14/}, which we call Unknown Functional
Elements (UFES). To calculate the probability Pufe(Sk|T) of a single
alignment column under the UFE, we integrate the probability P(S;C |wk, T)
over all possible WM columns wk, i.e.

Pufe(Sk1T)=/P(Skl"/(~T)P(V‘/()dwk~ (4)

where P(wk) is a prior distribution over possible alignment columns for
which MotEvo uses a Dirichlet prior (see Supplementary Material). To be
able to calculate such integrals analytically, MotEvo uses the F81 model for
the evolution along each branch of the tree. The Supplementary Materials
provide details of the calculation of this integral.

Another parameter used by MotEvo is the length l“ of the UFE model,
which is generally set to the typical length of TFBSs. The UFE model is
then treated as any other WM, and the probability ratio Pufe(S|T)/P(S lb, T)
is calculated for the 1,, consecutive alignment columns of an hypothesized
site of the UFE.

For the example shown in Figure 3, when the UFE model of length 10
is used, the posterior of the SRF motif drops to 0.01 and sites for the UFE
are predicted in this area with moderate posteriors. Note that MotEvo can
also be run using only the UFE model. In this way, a conservation proﬁle
that quantiﬁes the evidence for purifying selection across the alignments can

RArnold et al.

 

be obtained without the need of providing speciﬁc motifs (Molina and van
Nimwegen, 2008), i.e. providing a functionality similar to algorithms such
as phastcons (Siepel et al., 2005).

2.4 Forward/backward algorithm

In contrast to MONKEY (Moses et al., 2004) and other algorithms
that scan with a single WM at a time, MotEvo predicts TFBSs for an
arbitrary number of WMs and considers all possible conﬁgurations of non-
overlapping TFBSs. Above we calculated the WM/background probability
ratio P(Slw, T)/P(S|b, T) for alignment segment S assuming a single
hypothesized site for w. The probability ratio for an entire alignment given a
conﬁguration containing multiple binding sites is simply the product of the
ratios for each of the binding sites. Note that all parts of the alignment where
no binding sites occur do not contribute to this ratio, i.e. their contributions
cancel between numerator and denominator.

To assign prior probabilities to conﬁgurations, MotEvo assumes that
scanning the reference species sequence from left to right, there is at each
position a probability 71w for a site for WM w to start. For notational
simplicity, we consider both the UFE model and the background model b
as members of our set {w} of WMs. The prior probability for a binding site
conﬁguration in which there are nw sites for WM w is then proportional to

11%)”“1 (5)

w

Note that we have the normalization condition 2w 71w 2 1.

To calculate posterior probabilities, we will need to sum over the
probability ratios of all possible binding site conﬁgurations, i.e. calculate a
partition sum. To this end, we use recursion relations similar to those of the
forward/backward algorithm used in the theory of hidden Markov models
(Durbin et al., 1998). Let the sum of the probability ratios of all possible
conﬁgurations of TFBSs up to position n in the reference species be denoted
by F n. Noting that any conﬁguration ending at position n in the reference
species has to end with a site for one of our WMs (which now include the
background and UFE models), we have the recursion relation

P (S[rt—i,,.,i,,] IWw T)
Fn wgyftw P(SM—lwglw] lb, T) Fn—lw v 
where lw is the length of WM w.

Instead of moving from left to right over the multiple alignment, we can
also move from right to left and deﬁne R” as the sum over the probability
ratios of all possible binding site conﬁgurations from position n until the
end of the alignment. Further details are provided in the Supplementary
Materials.

2.5 TFBS predictions

Once the forward and backward sums F n and R” have been obtained, we can
calculate the posterior probabilities P(w,n|S, {w}, T) that a binding site for
WM w occurs at positions n+ 1 through n+lw:
P(Sian] lwaT)
n P(Smylwl‘bf) ann-i—lw-i—l

P(w,n|S, {w},T)= FL

. (7)
where F L is the sum over probability ratios of all conﬁgurations for the entire
alignment of length L. Note that the sum over all conﬁgurations in which
a site for w occurs at n is equal to the sum over all possible conﬁgurations
up to position n and all conﬁgurations from (n+lw + 1) onwards. Using the
procedures described above, posterior probabilities P(w, n|S, {w}, T) at every
position n for every WM w can be calculated in a time that is proportional
to product of the length of the multiple alignment L, the number of WMs
and the number of species in the alignment. This linear scaling of the run-
time allows MotEvo to make comprehensive site predictions for very large
sequences using a large number of WMs in relatively short computational
times. For example, when a TF is known to have different types of binding

sites, e.g. half-sites separated by spacers of different lengths, MotEvo can
easily run with WMs for each site type in parallel.

Note that, when running on a single sequence, MotEvo is equivalent to
a statistical mechanical model that calculates the binding frequencies along
the genome of multiple factors competing for binding along the genome,
i.e. on a single sequence MotEvo is equivalent to the approach presented
in Wasson and Hartemink (2009). In this biophysical interpretation, the
WM scores correspond to binding energies, the WM priors correspond to
the concentrations of the different factors and the posterior probabilities
correspond to the fractions of time a given TF is bound at a given site.

2.6 Prior updating

The prior probability distribution over binding site conﬁgurations is
parametrized by the vector 7'! that gives the expected binding site density
71w for each WM w, including the background and UFE models. This prior
7'! can be speciﬁed by the user, but MotEvo can also use an expectation7
maximization algorithm to ﬁnd the vector 7'! that maximizes the probability
of the observed alignments {S}.

We start with an initial prior vector 7'! and calculate the posterior
probabilities P(w,n|S,{w},T) for all alignments in the set {S}. We then
calculate, for each WM, the sum nw of the posterior probabilities
P(w, n|S, {w}, T) over all positions n in all alignments S. That is, nw represents
to the total expected number of binding sites for WM w. Using these MotEvo
calculates a new prior vector

nw
Zw/ €(w) "W

and calculates new posterior probabilities P(w,n|S, {w},T) using this new
prior vector. This procedure is iterated until the prior vector converges.
It is easy to Show, see e.g. van Nimwegen (2007), that this expectation7
maximization procedure maximizes the probability of the input alignments
with respect to the prior vector 71.

2.7 Enhancer prediction

Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements on the genome that are distal to the
promoter of the gene whose expression they regulate. They are characterized
by a high density of TFBSs for a particular subset of TFs and they are
typically a few hundred base pairs in length. They can occur both upstream,
downstream or in an intron of their target gene (Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005).

To ﬁnd enhancers, MotEvo extends previously developed algorithms
(Rajewsky et al., 2002; Sinha et al., 2003) to multiple alignments with an
arbitrary number of species and phylogenetic relationships. A window of
a given length (typically a few hundred base pairs) is slid over the input
alignments and for each window MotEvo predicts posterior probabilities of
binding site occurrence for the set of input WMS. Importantly, MotEvo then
updates the priors 71w separately for each window, allowing it to adapt the
binding site densities to each window. Note that, because TFBSs cannot
overlap within a single conﬁguration, the prior updating roughly tries to
maximize the number of TFBSs for the input WMs that can be bound at the
same time to a given region. To assign a ﬁnal enhancer score to a window,
MotEvo calculates the log-ratio of the sum of the probabilities of all possible
binding site conﬁgurations and the probability of the conﬁguration with only
background columns.

2.8 Weight matrix reﬁnement

MotEvo also implements an expectationimaximization procedure for
reﬁning WMs based on its TFBS predictions. Formally, the idea is to
maximize the probability of the entire input data {S} with respect to the
WMS {14/}, starting from the WMs that were provided as input. As shown in
the Supplementary Materials, this maximization can be obtained to a good
approximation, using the following procedure.

Starting from the input WMs {w}, MotEvo ﬁrst predicts posterior
probabilities P(w,n|S, {w}, T) for TFBS occurrence of each WM w at each

MotEvo

 

position n in each input alignment S. It then calculates, for each WM 14/, each
position i in the WM and each nucleotide 01, the sum n;(w) of the posterior
probabilities of all putative TFBSs that have a nucleotide 01 occurring at
position i of the site in the reference species. That is, the statistics n;(w)
calculate the expected total number of TFBSs for WM w that, in the reference
species, have nucleotide 01 at position i. Note that MotEvo can also be
instructed to ignore sites with posteriors below a cut-off in calculating these
sums. MotEvo then updates the WM as follows:

W,’ _ nia(W)
a — Eleni/30V) I

Site predictions are then performed with these updated WMs and this
procedure is repeated until the WMs converge. Using this procedure, MotEvo
thus extends the functionality of the PhyME algorithm (Sinha et al., 2004),
allowing for the simultaneous expectationimaximization of multiple motifs
in parallel.

3 RESULTS

Although a key beneﬁt of MotEvo as a computational tool is
that it integrates cutting-edge methods within a single executable,
we here focus on evaluating the performance beneﬁts of the
novel features that MotEvo implements. For benchmarking, we
collected ﬁve datasets (Jothi et (11., 2008; Valouev et (11., 2008) in
which chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed for the human TFs CTCF,
GABP, NRSF, SRF and STAT1. Using the peak ﬁnder MACS
(Zhang et (11., 2008), we determined the regions bound by the TF in
question for each ChIP-seq dataset. Binding regions that occurred
in more than one dataset were removed to ensure that (at least in the
conditions tested) only one TF is bound to each region. Finally, we
selected the 900 regions with highest enrichment from each dataset
(see Supplementary Materials for details).

Using pairwise genome alignments from the UCSC database
(Karolchik et (11., 2008), we extracted orthologous regions from six
other mammals (mouse, dog, cow, monkey, horse and opossum) and
obtained seven-way multiple alignments using T-coffee (Notredame
et (11., 2000). For NRSF, GABP, SRF and STAT1 known WM motifs
were taken from the literature (Vlieghe et (11., 2006) and a CTCF
WM was inferred from ChIP-chip data in ﬂy (Holohan et (11., 2007).

To test the new features, we predict TFBSs with MotEvo on the
benchmarking dataset both using the feature and with the feature
turned off. We then compare the TFBS predictions and evaluate to
what extent the TFBS predictions are able to infer which region
was bound by which TF. In addition, we compared MotEvo’s
performance on these datasets with those of MONKEY (Moses et (11.,
2004) and PhyloScan (Carmack et (11., 2007; Palumbo and Newberg,
2010). Finally, we test the performance of motifs obtained using
MotEvo’s motif reﬁnement and compare it with the performance of
motifs inferred by MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1994).

3.1 The UFE model strongly reduces spurious
predictions

We argued above that, without the UFE, highly conserved regions
are often mistakenly predicted as TFBSs for WMs in our set, even
when the sequences poorly match the corresponding motif. To test
this, we predicted TFBSs on all regions, once including the UFE and
once without it. For each TF, we determined the WM score of the
sequence occurring in the reference species at each predicted TFBS,

and constructed histograms of the distributions of WM scores (Fig.
4 and Supplementary Fig. S1).

Inclusion of the UFE in general leads to substantial changes in the
predicted TFBSs. First of all, the total number of predicted TFBSs
is much lower with the UFE. Second, the UFE speciﬁcally causes
predicted TFBSs that have a weak match to the motif to disappear.
Finally, using the UFE the fraction of predicted TFBSs that fall
in ‘correct’ regions, i.e. regions that were immunoprecipitated with
the corresponding TF often increases dramatically, i.e. from around
40% to over 90% for three of the ﬁve TFs (insets of Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Fig. S1). However, from this test it is not clear if
this increased speciﬁcity comes with a cost in sensitivity of the site
predictions, which we address in the following test.

3.2 MotEvo’s novel features improve TFBS prediction

To test MotEvo’s performance, and the role of its novel features in a
realistic setting, we tested how accurately the TFBS predictions can
distinguish which region was bound by which of the ﬁve TFs. For
each motif w and each region r, we assign a score n(r, w) by summing
the posterior probabilities of all predicted TFBSs for w in r. We then
obtain a sensitivity/positive predictive value (PPV) curve by, as a
function of a cut-off on the score n(r,w), calculating the fraction of
all regions bound by the corresponding TF that have a score above
the cut-off (sensitivity) and the fraction of all regions with score
above the cut-off that were indeed bound by the TF (PPV). We gather
such sensitivity/PPV curves using MotEvo in its standard form, with
the UFE model turned off, and with species selection turned off,
i.e. including sequences from all gaplessly aligned species at each
putative site. We also obtained binding site predictions for two TFBS
prediction algorithms that also incorporate an explicit evolutionary
model: MONKEY (Moses et (11., 2004) and PhyloScan (Carmack
et (11., 2007; Palumbo and Newberg, 2010) (see Supplementary
Materials for details), and determined their sensitivity/PPV curves.

We ﬁrst of all see that, without the UFE, MotEvo’s performance
is dramatically reduced. In particular, because of the large number
of spuriously predicted sites, no high speciﬁcity can be obtained
without the UFE (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Only at very
high sensitivities, i.e. when detecting even the regions with the

Fig. 5. Comparison of TFBS prediction accuracy for MotEvo (black),
MotEvo without the UFE (blue), MotEvo without species selection (green),
Monkey (red) and PhyloScan (pink). TFBS predictions were made on the
benchmark set of 5 times 900 regions by each of the methods and were then
used to predict, for each TF. which of the 4500 regions were bound by the
TF. The panels show sensitivity/PPV curves for the performance obtained

are shown in Supplementary Figure S2.

weakest TFBSs, is the performance relatively unaffected. Besides
the UFE, MotEvo explicitly considers that TFBSs may have been
lost in a subset of the species, either through evolution or simply
because of errors in the multiple alignment, by using the ‘species
selection’ scheme described above. We ﬁnd that species selection
leads to an increase in performance for all TFs (Supplementary Fig.
S2) ranging from small improvements at some TFs (NSRF, CTCF)
to moderate or even very large improvements for others (GABP
and SRF, Fig. 5). Thus, MotEvo’s method for treating loss and gain
of TFBSs within the phylogeny signiﬁcantly outperforms methods
that assume that all sequences in the multiple alignment are evolving
under the same selective constraints determined by the WM.

Although we invested some efforts optimizing the performance
of MONKEY and PhyloScan on this dataset (see Supplementary
Materials), MotEvo signiﬁcantly outperforms these algorithms (Fig.
5 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Especially striking is the inability
of these algorithms to reach high sensitivity for motifs with high
information content (NRSF, CTCF). Manual inspection of the
differences in the predictions of MotEvo, PhyloScan and MONKEY
strongly suggest that MONKEY and PhyloScan’s performance is
most affected by their inability to deal with alignment segments
where a binding site occurs in only some of the species, i.e. where
some of the species have either gaps relative to the reference
species or low WM scores (see Supplementary Materials for more
discussion). These algorithms effectively assume that a ﬁinctional
site must appear in all species of the alignment, and for multiple
alignments involving seven species there are many cases where this
is too restrictive an assumption.

Finally, we checked whether MotEvo’s performance is strongly
affected by the alignment algorithm used (Supplementary Fig. S6)
and ﬁnd that sensitivity/PPV curves change only marginally when
using different alignment methods. Similarly, use of a higher order
background model also only marginally improves performance on
these benchmarking datasets (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Fig. 6. Comparison of the performance in predicting TF binding of original
WMs based on literature, WMs reﬁned by MotEvo and WMs inferred by
MEME. Binding sites were predicted by MotEvo on all 5 X450 regions in
the test-set using the three WMs for each of the ﬁve TF5. The predicted
TFBSs were used to predict which TF is bound by each region. The panels
show sensitivity/PPV curves for the performance obtained using the original
(blue), the reﬁned motif (black) and MEME’S motif (green) for the TFs SRF
and CTCF. Sequence logos of the original and reﬁned WMs are shown in
each panel as well. Results for all TFs are shown in Supplementary Figure S3.

of TFs of interest, and the number of available datasets is increasing
rapidly. As ChIP-seq is able to identify large numbers, i.e. hundreds
to thousands, of binding regions for a given TF genome-wide, this
offers the possibility to investigate the binding speciﬁcity of TFs at
much higher levels of resolution than was previously possible.

MotEvo implements an expectation—maximization strategy for
reﬁning WMs from an input dataset of binding regions which we
here test using the same benchmarking ChIP-seq data for ﬁve TFs.
For each of the ﬁve TFs, we randomly selected 450 of the 900 peaks
and pooled them into one large dataset that we used as a test set.
The remaining 450 regions for each TF were used as a training set
for WM reﬁnement. Besides MotEvo, we also used MEME (Bailey
and Elkan, 1994) to infer a WM motif for each of the ﬁve test sets.
Sequence logos of the original and inferred motifs are shown in
Figure 6 and Supplementary Figures S3 and S4.

To test the performance of these WMs in identifying which TF
binds to which target region, we predicted TFBSs for all original
and reﬁned WMs on the test set using MotEvo. As in the previous
section, we assign a score n(r,w) for each WM w to each region
r by summing the posterior probabilities of predicted TFBSs, and
obtain sensitivity/PPV curves that quantify the performance of the
TFBSs in predicting which TF was bound by each region (Fig. 6
and Supplementary Fig. S3).

The improvement that reﬁnement provides over the literature
motif ranges from virtually no difference between original and
reﬁned WMs (GABP), through moderate improvements (SRF),
to very dramatic improvements (CTCF). It is notable that, even
when there is a clear difference in performance of the original
and reﬁned WMs, the sequence logos appear very similar visually.
This illustrates that subtle changes in the WM can have substantial
effects on TFBS predictions. Interestingly, in the case of STATl
the reﬁned motif is closer to a true palindrome than the original
motif, suggesting that these sites are bound by the TF in dimer
form. This is supported by the literature, i.e. it is known that
STATl is ‘activated’ through phosphorylation at a tyrosine, after
which STATl proteins form homo-dimers that are translocated to
the nucleus to regulate transcription (McBride and Reich, 2003). The
most dramatic improvement in performance is observed for CTCF.

This is not surprising given that, in contrast to the other TFs in this
set, for CTCF the original WM was based on data from Drosophila.
That is, it is plausible that the precise sequence speciﬁcity of CTCF
may differ between Drosophila and human.

MotEvo’s reﬁned WMs outperform the WMs inferred by MEME
for all TFs (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Although the
difference is marginal for NRSF, for some of the TFs MEME’s motif
performs clearly worse than the literature motif (see Supplementary
Materials for further discussion). In summary, our results show that
MotEvo’s WM reﬁnement consistently improves the ability of the
WM to distinguish regions bound by the TF from regions that are
bound by other TFs. In addition, this improvement can be very large
in some cases.

3.4 Enhancer prediction accuracy increases with the
number of species used

Finally, we evaluated MotEvo’s ability to predict distal cis-
regulatory modules (also called enhancers). For testing, we used
the set of 76 experimentally validated blastoderm cis-regulatory
modules (CRMs) that was collected in Ivan et a1. (2008). The length
of these CRMs ranges from ~90 bp to 2kb. For each CRM, we
extracted the ﬂanking region of 5 kb before and after the CRM on the
genome. We then multiply-align these regions with other sequenced
Drosophila species. As it is likely that these regions contain other
blastoderm CRMs that are unknown, we shufﬂe the aligned columns
of the ﬂanking region without changing the conservation pattern,
that is to say we substitute each column by a column with similar
conservation (same gap pattern and subset of species that has the
same base as the reference). Exonic regions are also excluded.

To test how prediction accuracy depends on the number of species
used in the multiple alignments, we made several pruned versions
of the multiple alignments by selecting different subsets of the
available species, ranging from only the melanogaster sequence, to
sequences from nine available species (see Supplementary Materials
and Supplementary Fig. S5 for details). We use MotEvo with seven
WMs for Drosophila TFs known to be involved in binding to
these enhancers (Bcd, Cad, Dl, Hb, Kni, Kr and T11), to perform
enhancer predictions on all multiple alignments, selecting for each
alignment the 900 bp window with the highest enhancer score as the
predicted enhancer. To assess the performance, we calculated for
each alignment the overlap between the predicted and the known
enhancer. As Table 1 shows, the performance increases signiﬁcantly
as the number of species increases, reaching over 90% performance
when nine species are used. This illustrates that MotEvo’s ability
to predict enhancers on multiple alignments of an arbitrary number
of species signiﬁcantly improves accuracy over methods that only
allow pairwise analysis.

4 DISCUSSION

From a theoretical point of view, the major advantage of the
MotEvo method we presented here is that it integrates cutting-
edge Bayesian probabilistic methods for the prediction of TFBSs,
regulatory motifs and conservation patterns within one consistent
theoretical frame work, developing several novel features such as
the UFE model and species selection in the process. In addition, our
benchmarking tests have demonstrated that these features improve
MotEvo’s performance, and that MotEvo outperforms currently
available methods. Another major advantage of the MotEvo tool
is its versatility, i.e. by simple changes to the parameter ﬁle the tool
can perform a wide array of tasks ranging from motif inference, to
enhancer prediction, to conservation proﬁle mapping, site density
estimation and of course TFBS prediction. Moreover, essentially
all variables used by the algorithm, from phylogeny to background
models, to priors, can be controlled by the user, allowing these to be
adapted to a wide range of applications. For example, using MotEvo
in combination with genome-wide mapping of transcription start
sites we have predicted functional TFBSs for hundreds of WMs in
proximal promoters in human, mouse (Suzuki et a1., 2009), yeast
(Chen et a1., 2010) and Escherichia coli. We have also obtained
reﬁned WMs using MotEvo on ChIP-seq datasets for a number of
TFs beyond those studied here. All these TFBS and motif predictions
are available for download from our SwissRegulon database at
www.swissregulon.unibas.ch.

As experimental validation of the functionality of individual
TFBSs is extremely labor intensive, it remains highly challenging
to estimate the accuracy of large-scale TFBS predictions. In the
past, it has sometimes been assumed that ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq
datasets can be treated as a gold standard, but our own analysis
suggests that computational predictions can, in fact, be considerable
more accurate in mapping functional sites than such high-throughput
experimental approaches (Chen et a1., 2010).

What is clear is that TF binding and ﬁinction is highly context
dependent. For a TF with a short degenerate motif, there may be
millions of sites genome wide with motif matches at least as high as
known functional sites, but in a typical ChIP-seq experiment only a
few thousand of these are found to be actually bound, and even
among these only a subset may directly affect gene expression.
In the search for variables that provide important context, it is
important to distinguish those that are merely predictive for the
functionality of TFBSs from those that are explanatory. Cross-
species conservation is an example of an explanatory variable,
i.e. highly conserved TFBSs are more likely to be ﬁinctional, but
conservation is not explanatory; sequences in other species cannot
explain why a particular sequence is bound or functional in a given
species.

In higher eukaryotes, the chromatin state is likely to be an
important explanatory variable. In areas where the nucleosomes are
densely packaging the DNA, it may be hard for a TF to access
an individual site in the DNA. This may explain why functional
TFBSs come in clusters of nearby sites for co-expressed TFs: these
TFs may passively cooperate in displacing the nucleosomes from
the DNA. Such a model can potentially explain the observation that
the genomic binding pattern observed for a given TF is dependent on
the expression proﬁles of other TFs (Wilczynski and Furlong, 2010).
However, to what extent binding and function of TFBSs is dependent
on a high-order ‘grammar’ of TFBS conﬁgurations, i.e. the precise

spacing and relative orientation of the sites, is currently unclear. In
order to make progress on these important questions, we believe
that the largest potential lies in integrating sequence analysis with
the analysis of temporal patterns of TF binding, of genome-wide
chromatin states and of the expression of potential target genes.

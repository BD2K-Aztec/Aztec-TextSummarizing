ABSTRACT

Motivation: Metabolic and signaling pathways are an increasingly
important part of organizing knowledge in systems biology. They
serve to integrate collective interpretations of facts scattered
throughout literature. Biologists construct a pathway by reading
a large number of articles and interpreting them as a consistent
network, but most of the models constructed currently lack direct
links to those articles. Biologists who want to check the original
articles have to spend substantial amounts of time to collect
relevant articles and identify the sections relevant to the pathway.
Furthermore, with the scientific literature expanding by several
thousand papers per week, keeping a model relevant requires a
continuous curation effort. In this article, we present a system
designed to integrate a pathway Visualizer, text mining systems
and annotation tools into a seamless environment. This will enable
biologists to freely move between parts of a pathway and relevant
sections of articles, as well as identify relevant papers from large
text bases. The system, PathText, is developed by Systems Biology
Institute, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, National
Centre for Text Mining (University of Manchester) and the University
of Tokyo, and is being used by groups of biologists from these
locations.

1 INTRODUCTION

The core of systems biology is the biochemical/signaling network.
Signaling and metabolic pathways are an increasingly important
part of organizing knowledge in systems biology and are often
represented through collective interpretations of facts scattered
throughout literature (Heiner et (11., 2004; Kell and Oliver, 2004;
Luciano and Stevens, 2007; Ye and Doak, 2009).

Because of the very integrated nature of pathways, they require
substantial human effort to construct. Biologists have to read a
large number of published papers, interpret them and construct a
pathway (Ananiadou et (11., 2006). The curation of a constructed
pathway also requires monitoring of recent publications in order to
maintain relevance. Furthermore, since biologists may have different
interpretations of the same set of facts, a biologist wants to read
original papers based on which a pathway is constructed to ensure

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

it is done in a manner consistent with his or her interpretation. The
biologist would like to see the biological context, stated in original
papers, from which the constructed pathway abstracts away (Kell,
2006; Kell and Oliver, 2004).

PathText (http://www.pathtext.org) is an integrated environment
for combining standards compliant (Finney and Hucka, 2003; Hucka
et (11., 2003) biological pathway models and original papers relevant
to selected parts of the pathway, through the use of text mining
(TM) technology (Ananiadou et (11., 2006) and tools to facilitate the
creation of manual annotations.

Unlike existing pathway building platforms, such as
WikiPathways (Pico et (11., 2008), the Edinburgh Pathway
Editor (Sorokin et (11., 2006), and PathCase (Elliott et (11., 2008),
PathText brings together the strengths of different TM tools in a
uniﬁed and extensible framework. Some of the existing pathway
editors offer the functionality of linking parts of a pathway with
literature at a very coarse (e.g. PubMed ID) level. Perhaps one
of the most similar to PathText in terms of the richness of TM
functionality combined with pathway visualization is Pathway
Studio (Nikitin et (11., 2003), which is a commercial tool for building
and analyzing biological pathways. It integrates an automated text
processing tool called MedScan to extract biological interactions
from scientiﬁc literature using natural language processing (NLP)
technology.

MedScan employs a ﬁill syntactic parser to analyze the semantic
and lexical structure of an English sentence and ﬁnds relations
between any types of objects including proteins, small molecules,
protein ﬁinctional classes, cell processes and diseases (Daraselia
et (11., 2004; Yuryev et (11., 2006).

PathText distinguishes itself from other pathway editing tools by
providing a seamless combination of advanced TM technologies,
including deep syntactic analysis of individual sentences (MEDIE),
named entity recognition and disambiguation of acronyms (KLEIO),
and real time co-occurrence searches (FACTA). It provides a ﬂexible
interactive environment which allows a biologist to navigate from
pathway visualization to TM, to retrieve articles recently published
which are potentially relevant, to browse them, and to associate them
with relevant parts of pathways.

PathText has been used by biologists to construct signaling
pathways of more than 1000 nodes with 400 links. In the following
sections, we provide the overall architecture of PathText, describe
the manual annotation and TM components, describe how they are
integrated with the overall system, and discuss future directions.

2 OVERALL ARCHITECTURE OF PATHTEXT

PathText provides a user friendly interface by which one can
freely move from pathways to relevant articles, or to parts of
ﬁill papers annotated by biologists during the model construction
phase. A detailed illustration of the user interface is provided on the
PathText website (http://www.pathtext.org). The central component
of PathText is the Integrator, which coordinates interaction between
(i) Payao pathway visualizations, (ii) TM systems, (iii) manual
annotations and (iv) the PathText results GUI (see Fig. l).

2.1 Payao pathway visualizations

Users of the PathText system access pathway model visualizations
through the Payao Web 2.0 (Matsuoka et (11., 2008) community-
based collaborative web-service platform for modeling biological
networks, a framework designed to enable a community to work on
models concurrently. Payao reads the models in SBML (Systems
Biology Markup Language, http://sbml.org) format, displays them
with CellDesigner (http://celldesigner.org), a process diagram editor
(http://celldesigner.org) which complies with the process description
notation deﬁned by SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation,
http://sbgn.org) language, and provides an interface for model
enrichment (adding tags and comments to models) for the access-
controlled community members (see Fig. 2).

2.2 TM systems

The PathText Integrator reads information from a pathway model
ﬁle in SBML and SBGN, and generates queries for TM systems
tailored to the speciﬁc requirements of each. These queries are sent
to each of the TM systems through a web service and results from
each are stored in the repository of the PathText Integrator.

2.3 Manual annotations

PathText includes tools to assist biologists in creating manual
annotations linking speciﬁc sections of original publications with
nodes in a pathway model. These links are also stored in the
repository of the PathText Integrator.

2.4 PathText results GUI

A Payao user interacts with the PathText system by selecting
document icons overlaid on the pathway visualization. These links

but the reactions linking them as well. The PathText Integrator
presents matching results through a new tab in the user’s web
browser, making PathText feel as if it were a part of Payao.

3 MANUAL ANNOTATION/MODEL CURATION

One of the crucial deﬁciencies in currently constructed biological
pathways is their lack of detailed linkage with original articles.
While some models embed the identiﬁers of articles such as PubMed
IDs or their bibliographic information, some do not have any links.
Even for models with uniquely identiﬁed papers, biologists who
want to check the evidence provided in the original papers spend a
signiﬁcant amount of time retrieving the papers and then identifying
the parts (e. g. paragraphs, sentences, tables, ﬁgures, etc.) relevant to
the speciﬁc nodes or links in a model that they are interested in.
PathText provides a tool for manual annotation of ﬁill papers that
can be used during the model curation phase. The tool is web based
and assists biologists to create manual annotations, connecting nodes
and links in a pathway to arbitrary rectangular regions in papers.

Fig. 3. PathText manual annotation tool and search results GUI. In the
top screen. the ﬁrst page of an article is shown with a yellow rectangular
region which is judged relevant by a biologist. In the right column. a list of
annotations in this article with the name of annotator. her/his comment. etc.
is shown. By clicking one of them. a user can jump to the corresponding part
of the article. In the bottom screen. a list of full articles which are manually
annotated. By clicking one of the articles. a user can see pages of the article
in which annotations are made (the bottom half of the screen).

It is used not only at the initial model curation phase, but also for
the monitoring phase in later stages of the process.

In Figure 3, we see an example of PathText manual annotation.
First, a curator identiﬁes an initial set of articles by searching through
MEDLINE via the automatic search or manual search mode (see
Section 6). Then the curator collects the ﬁill-paper version of the
retrieved abstracts judged to be relevant and submits them to the
PathText Integrator where they are converted (often from PDF) into
images and stored in the PathText repository. The curator then views
the publications using PathText to annotate the relevant parts in the
model with selected rectangular regions on the images of the ﬁill
papers. A rectangular region is stored in the Integrator along with
the text inside the region, publication details and the identiﬁer of the
node or link in the model annotated by the region in the ﬁill paper.
PathText enables biologists to see all the ﬁill papers, and the parts
judged as relevant to a speciﬁc part of a model by other biologists,
by simple operations such as clicking an icon attached to links or
nodes in a network.

4 TM SYSTEMS

In addition to the manual annotation tool for biologists to create
annotated links between models and ﬁill papers, the PathText

Integrator includes a method to retrieve new papers relevant to
speciﬁc parts of a model through the use of TM systems. The only
way of linking parts of a model with such an implicit set of papers is
in the form of queries, by which each of the individual TM systems
retrieves a set of text. Because the results returned by each TM
system have their own semantic annotations, the Integrator needs to
interpret the annotations in retrieved text to identify the portions of
text relevant to the model and visualize them.

We integrate three TM systems (MEDIE, KLEIO and FACTA)
in PathText, each of which has different characteristics, its own
strengths and weaknesses. The crucial considerations are how
to maximize the effectiveness of the system by exploiting the
characteristics of these TM systems, and how to reduce the burden
of a user in interaction with these TM systems.

A pathway represents a speciﬁc biological context in which
species (genes, proteins, enzymes, etc.) and relations among them
(phosphorylation, binding, degradation, etc.) occur. When a user
clicks a speciﬁc node in a pathway, she/he is most likely to be
not interested in the gene, protein, enzyme, etc. in general that the
node represents. Instead, they are interested in the gene, protein
or enzyme in the speciﬁc context. Such rich contextual information
should be used in query formation to improve the precision. MEDIE,
the query language of which is highly expressive, provides the
means by which such rich contextual information is embedded
in a query. The integrator in PathText stores the associations
between nodes/relations and complex query formulas. The complex
queries and their associations are established in advance during the
model curation phase. On the other hand, while such ﬁxed queries
embedded in a pathway model in advance are effective, a biologist
wants to navigate a set of documents rather freely. The general
query format which MEDIE provides is, though expressive, too
complex. Interactive query formation provided by KLEIO, including
rich semantic annotations and facet-search based on them, is ideal
for such free navigation of document sets.

The other ﬁinctionality, which we have found extremely useful, is
to allow a user to formulate a query on the ﬂy by using visualization
of pathway. That is, she/he clicks an arbitrary number of nodes in a
pathway and then, the system returns a set of documents in which
the species those nodes represent co-occur, together with distribution
statistics of the other species in the pathway. FACTA provides this
functionality with its specialized indexing.

4.1 MEDIE

MEDIE (http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medie/search.cgi)
(Miyao et (11., 2006) is an intelligent search engine to retrieve
biomedical relational information from a large textbase created
from MEDLINE. Figure 4, shows MEDIE text mining search
results in PathText. The textbase stores the whole MEDLINE
abstracts, with annotations represented by XML-like text markup
for both the metadata of the articles provided by NLM (MeSH
terms, publication date, etc.), and analysis results by various NLP
modules. The annotated text is indexed for efﬁcient structure search
by extended region algebra (ERA) (Masuda and Tsujii, 2008).
A query with high precision can be formulated by using NLP
analyses results and the region algebra.

The NLP modules used for the annotation include (but not
limited to) a deep syntactic analyzer, an event expression recognizer
(EER) and a term recognizer. The syntactic analyzer, Enju

Fig. 5. A semantic relation expressed in different textual expressions: these
two tree structures represent two sentences with different voices (active and
passive). which essentially describe the same event. The identity of the event
is captured by the predicate-argument structures (PAS. shown by dotted
lines) of these sentences. Enju computes such predicate-argument structures
of sentences. and one can formulate a query based on PAS in the region
algebra to retrieve the sentences which contain events of ‘protein A activates
protein B’.

parser (Miyao et (11., 2009), produces a syntactic and semantic
analysis of the text, based on a linguistic formalism called HPSG
(Pollard and Sag, 1994). A relational concept, such as ‘protein A
activates protein B’, can be precisely described as a query which
speciﬁes the semantic structure given by the Enju parser as constraint
(see Figs 5 and 6). This is the main strength of MEDIE compared
to other publicly available TM modules which use Boolean formula
of keywords or concepts for query formulation. Boolean formulas
basically specify co-occurrence of concepts or words as constraint
for retrieval. One can only specify co-occurrence of protein A,
protein B and the verb ‘to activate’ in the same textual unit (usually
an abstract) as constraint, which results in a large number of false
positives.

Units of retrieval in MEDIE are ﬁner than those in other TM
modules. They can be individual sentences in abstracts, or even

and $obj are variables. They are used to express the dotted lines in Figure 5.
For example. $sbj is used to equate the phrase which plays the role of argl
in a sentence with the phrase which contains the word ‘protein-A’.

phrases. Furthermore, the ERA allows us to specify constraints
on context from constraints on units of retrieval. That is, we
can formulate a query for retrieving sentences which contain a
speciﬁc biological event (e. g. *ProteinA* activates *protein B*) and
which appear in abstracts with certain keywords or other biological
events reported. This separation of units of retrieval and context is
extremely useﬁil for PathText to specify constraints embodied by
the neighboring parts of a pathway network.

The semantic representation produced by Enju also works as
an intermediate language which bridges the gap between a search
query and the textual expression in the article. That is, a single
semantic relation is represented in the same way in the semantic
representation level, across various different textual expressions, and
hence retrieved with a single query. See Figure 5 for an example
of a semantic relation ‘protein A activates protein B’, expressed
differently in surface textual form, in which the semantic subject
(ARGl) and semantic object (ARG2) of the verb ‘activate’ is
represented in the same way in the semantic representation level
(indicated by the dashed arrows).

The EER and the term recognizer ﬁirther enhance the search
capability of MEDIE by introducing another level of abstraction
of semantics. They map surface textual expressions of biological
events or technical terms to the corresponding concept identiﬁers
deﬁned in ontologies. The EER recognizes biological molecular
events mentioned in text and map them to identiﬁers of event types
deﬁned in terms of Ontology (Ashburner et (11., 2000). The current
version of EER distinguishes 35 event types in G0, which include
binding, positive/negative regulation, etc. Using the annotations by
Enju and the EER, we can retrieve sentences in which a biological
event of ‘positive regulation of protein A by protein B’ is reported,
even though they may be expressed in diverse surface expressions
like ‘A activates B’, ‘B is induced by A’, and so on. The domain
speciﬁc lexical knowledge, like the synonymy of ‘activate’ and
‘induce’ in the molecular biology domain, was collected from the
GENIA Event corpus (Kim et (11., 2008).

The term recognizer detects gene, protein and disease names in
the text, and assign unique database IDs to differently expressed
entity names (i.e. synonyms). The gene/protein IDs are taken from
a gene/protein meta-DB, Gena (Koike and Takagi, 2004) and the
disease IDs are taken from UMLS. By combining the annotations
given by the term recognizer with ones by the parser and the EER,
we can recognize a biological event in even when an entity (protein
or gene) involved there is mentioned in different names.

The index for MEDIE is based on the ERA. In the ERA, we can
specify a semantic relation encoded as the topological relations (e. g.
a text span includes another text span, a text span follows another text
span, etc.) among textual spans and annotations. Structural relations

can also be directly represented by linking variables. For example,
to retrieve the sentences that mention a binding event between
‘protein A’ and ‘protein B’, we formulate a query that has three key
phrases: ‘protein A’, ‘protein B’ and ‘bind’ among which a semantic
relation ‘protein A binds to protein B’ holds. The query in the ERA
is shown in Figure 6.

MEDIE accepts a search query through a WEB-API, in addition
to an interactive search U1. The API takes a tuple of <subject, verb,
object> as the input, which describes a biological event/relation,
such as <p53, activate, beta-4>, and returns a set of articles in which
the event/relation is mentioned. The tuple is internally translated to
an ERA query, using the same gene/protein dictionary and event
expression dictionary used in the above-mentioned NLP modules.
For example, the tuple <p53, activate, beta-4> is translated to
the following region-algebra query shown in Figure 7. The WEB-
API thus hides irrelevant details of the backend database from the
viewpoint of the users, such as the annotation schemes used in the
NLP modules or the dictionary used in developing it. A speciﬁcation
on the meta-data part such as journal titles can be expressed as
additional ﬁelds to the subject-verb-object tuple.

4.2 KLEIO

KLEIO (http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/kleio/) (Nobata et (11.,
2008) uses the results of named entity recognition to provide a range
of semantic search functions. A standard indexing tool, Lucene,
is used to generate an index over the terms for proteins, genes,
metabolites and medical terms that have been recognized. This is
an index of the concepts that are referred to in the text, rather
than individual, or canonical word forms. This ﬁinctionality allows
us to retrieve documents that refer to a speciﬁc concept, although
the surface form used may differ in each case, as in the use of
orthographic variants, or acronyms instead of their expansions. In
KLEIO, ﬁill forms of named entities, including variants, are linked
to their acronyms via an acronym recognition and disambiguation
process (Okazaki and Ananiadou, 2006). The system also offers
document retrieval based on the unique identiﬁer for a concept,
providing a link back to the original databases from which the
system’s dictionary was generated. In addition, by further classifying
terms into semantic categories the system allows the user to specify
a speciﬁc concept, by associating a semantic category with a query
term. This can radically reduce the search space. For example,
more than 60 000 documents were returned when the word ‘cat’
was given as a query, due to its ambiguity. However, when the
query was modiﬁed to specify the desired semantic category for
‘cat’ e.g. PROTEIN, a more focused result is returned. For the
query ‘PROTEINzcat’, 200 documents were returned. Moreover, the
documents returned by the initial query are dynamically organized
into semantic facets based on the named entities recognized both

in the query and occurring in the same immediate context in each
document retrieved. The user may thus reﬁne the initial query by
combining concepts from the offered facets or may pursue the links
to the document representations. The documents themselves are
presented with concept markup on all the recognized terms.

As with MEDIE, KLEIO stores the whole set of abstracts
from MEDLINE together with metadata provided by the National
Library of Medicine and augments these data with rich semantic
annotations. Semantic annotation in KLEIO is much richer in
semantic categories of named entities than those of MEDIE, though
it does not have syntactic/semantic annotations of sentences. The
normalized identiﬁers which KLEIO uses are, therefore, not only
UniProt identiﬁers and UMLS identiﬁers, but also HMDB and
DrugBank identiﬁers for small molecules and metabolites which
are crucial for integrating metabolic pathways. Acronyms, which
are pervasive in biological papers, are also disambiguated (Okazaki
et (11., 2010) and normalized into identiﬁers if the disambiguated
results belong to the semantic categories which KLEIO is able to
deal with. Because of surface word indexing and richer semantic
categories, KLEIO is used as a fall-back system when species in a
model are not covered by MEDIE. KLEIO accepts PathText queries
through a WEB-API. The API accepts space separated terms as well
as Boolean queries, for example ‘p65 AND beta4’. KLEIO then
returns a set of articles relevant to the query in XML containing
PubMed IDs and the abstract highlighted with the terms matching
the query.

4.3 FACTA

FACTA (http://reﬁne1-nactem.mc.man.ac.uk/facta/) (Tsuruoka
et (11., 2008) is an information retrieval system with a usage very
different from MEDIE and KLEIO. It takes large sets of articles
(the whole MEDLINE in the current version of FACTA) to ﬁnd
implicit associations between named entities, by using statistical
measures of co-occurrences of entities in the same articles. It can
ﬁnd and show a biologist a list of genes, for example, which would
be relevant to a given disease.

FACTA was originally designed as an interactive system to show
the user such a list of entities on the ﬂy, and special care was taken
to compute the statistical measures very quickly. More speciﬁcally,
it builds a special data structure called inverted index that allows for
efﬁcient access to articles in which a particular set of entities appear.
This data structure enables the system to compute co-occurrence
statistics on the ﬂy even if the input entities appear in a large number
of articles. For example, FACTA can produce a ranked list of genes
and proteins that co-occur with ‘p53’, which is mentioned in more
than 46 000 articles, in 0.04 s. Combined with the PathText interface,
FACTA allows the user to select an arbitrarily subset of the species in
the pathway and immediately ﬁnd the information about which other
species co-occur with them in the literature (Fig. 8) (see Section 6.2).

It should be noted that such co-occurrence statistics cannot be
computed off-line, because the user is allowed to specify any
combination of the species as the input. This is the reason why
PathText needed to integrate the ﬁinctionality of FACTA, which is
tuned for real-time uses with a special index structure. In contrast,
retrieval of articles by MEDIE and KLEIO is performed in batch
mode (i.e. off-line) and the results are attached to the relevant part
of a model in the repository of the Integrator (see Section 6.1).

Unlike MEDIE or KLEIO, FACTA currently uses a simple
longest matching algorithm to recognize gene/protein names in

the literature. The dictionary was created from BioThesaurus
(Liu et (11., 2006) with some manual curation efforts including the
removal of noisy and highly ambiguous entries.

FACTA runs on a generic Linux server with 2.2GHz AMD
Opteron processors and 16GB memory, on which all the inverted
indexes are stored.

5 QUERYING OF TM SYSTEMS

The primary ﬁinction of the PathText Integrator is to gather
information from pathway model ﬁles, generate queries that can
be interpreted by various TM tools and store the results from these
queries in a repository.

In the ﬁrst step of this process, the PathText Integrator reads an
SBML model ﬁle and generates tables for the various components in
the repository. This data includes information such as proteins and
gene labels, characteristics for these entities such as phosphorylation
and ubiquitination, and details for the reactions that link them
together. The Integrator also reads MIRIAM annotations (Le Novere
et (11., 2005) containing unique identiﬁers such as UniProt. This data
can then be used to generate queries conforming to the disparate
formats of each TM application. For example, MEDIE accepts
queries in a <subj ect, verb, object> format. In the case of a reaction
contained in the pathway, the Integrator will use a set of rules to
determine a valid verb for describing the reaction by interpreting
the components of that reaction. For example, if a reaction starts
with a non-phosphorylated protein on one side, and contains the
same protein with phosphorylation on the other, then the verb
‘phosphorylates’ can be generated. For generating a query for a
species, the system uses unique identiﬁers, such as UniProt if the
system supports them, and text labels for that entity in other cases.
PathText also includes a ‘manual override’ ﬁinction, where a query
for a particular protein or reaction can be manually added to the
SBML model ﬁle in a PathText Annotation Tag that takes precedence
over queries generated by the Integrator.

6 PATHTEXT MODES OF OPERATION

PathText provides rich modes of operation for assisting biologists
to create and maintain links between biological models and large

 

collections of articles, through the whole life cycle of a model,
e.g. curation of articles and model building, model updating,
exploration of articles by TM tools through a model, etc. In
addition to the manual annotation tools described above, two distinct
methods for interacting with the PathText Integrator and the manual
annotations and TM results it contains: automatic and manual
Search.

6.1 Automatic search with updating function

Once a model is constructed and annotated with relevant papers,
curators or biologists want to retrieve other articles which may
be relevant to each part of the model. The queries generated by
the Integrator for individual nodes and links are used to retrieve
abstracts from MEDLINE. Since these queries are generated in
advance, PathText performs text retrieval regardless of actual user
requests and results are attached to corresponding parts of a model.
This off-line renewal of retrieval results is to be performed on a
nightly schedule as new set of abstracts are added to the MEDLINE
databases of MEDIE and KLEIO on daily basis. The automatic
search mode uses this set of retrieved abstracts. The mode is called
‘automatic’ since biologists cannot create new queries on the ﬂy.
They can only specify a date range. Date rage speciﬁcation is
important for up-dating a model by newly published articles. The
Integrator passes the information on how many abstracts are found
for each part of a model to Payao, and Payao then displays document
icons overlaid on the pathway visualization over the corresponding
entities (proteins, genes, reactions, etc.).

Clicking on any of these document icons will open a new tab in the
user’s browser with the matching PathText results. This results page
contains tabbed sections, one for already curated articles by manual
annotation and one for each TM system (MEDIE and KLEIO) that
has relevant matches to display. While one can easily View parts of
full papers relevant in the curated articles, the Integrator interprets
the annotations in abstracts given by the TM systems and displays
them in the same format including article title, authors, publication
date, the name of journals and the abstract with the matching terms
highlighted.

6.2 Manual search

The ‘manual search’ mode allows a biologist to freely explore new
articles by using the TM services, currently FACTA, with their own
queries. The simplest form of a new query is constructed by clicking
several nodes (species) in a model. When receiving a set of identiﬁers
for the selected nodes from Payao, the PathText Integrator invokes
FACTA to retrieve a set of abstracts in which the selected species
co-occur, and then checks whether these abstracts also contain other
species in the model. The numbers of abstracts which contain other
species are sent back to Payao with the identiﬁers of the species.
Payao displays document icons on the corresponding entities in
the network color-coded according to the numbers of abstracts (see
Fig. 5). Clicking on any of these document icons will open up a
PathText results tab.

7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

PathText integrates three knowledge sources indispensable for
systems biology, i.e. (i) external databases such as SwissProt,
EntreGene, Flybase, HUGO, etc., (ii) text databases such as

MEDLINE and ﬁill papers, and (iii) pathways as organized
interpretations of biological facts. Since integration of external
databases with other knowledge sources has already been attempted
and achieved through dictionaries of identiﬁers of the databases, this
article focused on the integration of pathways with literature.

PathText successﬁilly provides integration of text to pathways
and is now being used by three biological groups at the Systems
Biology Institute, the University of Tokyo (Oda et (11., 2008) and
the Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology in the UK
(Herrgard et (11., 2008). The implementation of PathText relies on
the software being developed by the consortium members. Payao,
which maintains a database of pathway models and provides the
software for the pathway visualization interface, is being developed
by SBI and OIST. Information is available on the Payao website
(http://www.payaologue.org). The two TM systems, KLEIO and
FACTA, which annotate MEDLINE abstracts by rich semantic
annotations of named entities, are provided by the National Centre
for Text Mining (http://www.nactem.ac.uk). The TM system for
automatic search, MEDIE, has been developed by the University
of Tokyo.

While these subcomponents had their stande WEB-APIs, we
added extra functionalities to them for PathText. These extended
APIs will be made available with necessary standardization for other
groups that are interested in similar knowledge integration.

There are several issues for future development.

(1) The design decisions of the current PathText are highly
dependent on a speciﬁc type of pathway, i.e. signaling
pathway which is being developed at the University of Tokyo.
In particular, automatic query generation reﬂects speciﬁc
characteristics of this pathway. The biology research group
in Manchester, which is engaged in research of metabolic
pathways, has signiﬁcantly different requirements. We need
to impose proper modularization of the current PathText
Integrator, in order to meet the differing requirements of users.

(2) The current use of biological context in generating queries is
rather straightforward. As our pilot study shows (Oda et (11.,
2008), the biological contexts in a pathway affects relevance
judgments by biologists. We need detailed error analyses on
the results produced by text retrieval components to generate
appropriate queries from a given pathway model.

V

The three TM subsystems work separately in PathText. The
query generation is designed separately for each of them, and
mixing of their results is not done at present. The results are
only presented in the same display format. In the future, these
results will be ranked according to different types of user
needs such as displaying contradictory facts extracted from
text.

Internal informal evaluation by our collaborating biology teams
has demonstrated the usefulness of PathText for their work. The
teams are continuing to use the system. Their ongoing feedback is
being incorporated into a novel user based evaluation framework
which will be used for a formal evaluation in conjunction with a
wider community.

(4) While the PathText data repository is managed locally, this
should be maintained by a global database. Moreover, future
plans include expansion to tackle the analysis of full papers

not just abstracts. Techniques to achieve such analysis are
already being developed by the National Centre for Text
Mining within the UKPubMed Central project. However,
we note that in the general case, the use of full papers is
related with the issue of copyright and access to commercial
publishers’ collections. PathText is currently only used by
biologists who belong to institutions with access rights to
ﬁill papers. In order for models in PathText to be freely
accessed by a wider community, we need to include a proper
authentication method for accessing full papers.

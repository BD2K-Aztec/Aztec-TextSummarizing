ABSTRACT

Summary: Most current stable isotope-based methodologies are
targeted and focus only on the well-described aspects of metabolic
networks. Here, we present NTFD (non-targeted tracer fate detection),
a software for the non-targeted analysis of all detectable compounds
derived from a stable isotope-labeled tracer present in a GC/MS data-
set. In contrast to traditional metabolic flux analysis approaches,
NTFD does not depend on any a priori knowledge or library informa-
tion. To obtain dynamic information on metabolic pathway activity,
NTFD determines mass isotopomer distributions for all detected and
labeled compounds. These data provide information on relative fluxes
in a metabolic network. The graphical user interface allows users to
import GC/MS data in netCDF format and export all information into a
tab-separated format.

Availability: NTFD is C++- and Qt4-based, and it is freely available
under an open-source license. Pre-compiled packages for the instal-
lation on Debian- and Redhat-based Linux distributions, as well as
Windows operating systems, along with example data, are provided
for download at http://ntfd.mit.edu/.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the advent of systems biology, scientists now have the
ability to probe and quantify the transcriptome, proteome and
metabolome of Virtually any organism (Fiehn et al., 2000;
Malmstrom et al., 2007; Schena et al., 1995). In the case of meta-
bolic characterizations, gas chromatography (GC) coupled to
mass spectrometry (MS) provides an excellent means of measur-
ing and cataloging small molecule metabolites obtained from a
variety of systems (Hiller et al., 2009). Techniques such as GC/
MS generate extremely rich datasets; however, these methods
are somewhat limited in that they (i) require a priori knowledge
of a given metabolite for identiﬁcation; (ii) contain signiﬁcant
amounts of data not relevant to a given experiment; and (iii) pro-
vide a static View of metabolism. Indeed, such methodologies

are often incapable of discovering new phenomena that have
yet to be described in detail. Furthermore, quantiﬁcation of
metabolites can be of limited use when characterizing dynamic
processes like metabolism. Metabolic ﬂuxes provide the ultim-
ate readout of in vivo enzyme activity (Stephanopoulos, 1999).
To this end, researchers use metabolic ﬂux analysis (MFA),
which uses stable isotopes to generate information on the
dynamics of metabolic processes (Sauer, 2006). As isotope-
labeled substrates are metabolized and incorporated into down-
stream metabolites in an organism, the information contained
in mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) provides a readout
on the relative ﬂuxes in a metabolic network (Wiechert, 2001).
Unfortunately, MFA requires comprehensive knowledge on
the topography of metabolic networks in any organism
under study. Therefore, as new organisms are identiﬁed and
disease mechanisms are increasingly linked to aberrant meta-
bolic processes, the need for discovery-based tools to detect
and elucidate the dynamics of cellular metabolism is becoming
apparent.

Here, we present a software, non-targeted tracer fate detection
(NTFD), which detects all observable metabolites labeled by a
stable isotope tracer within a GC/MS dataset (Hiller et al., 2010).
In addition, NTFD calculates MIDs for all ions derived from
labeled compounds that are corrected for natural isotope
abundance. As changes in intracellular reaction rates are directly
reﬂected in the MIDs of metabolic intermediates, these data
are crucial for the study of metabolic ﬂuxes and enzyme activ-
ities. In contrast to MFA, NTFD requires no a priori informa-
tion on the biological system (e.g. compound libraries or
fragment formulas). Thus, NTFD provides a straightforward
framework for combining the systems-level capabilities of
traditional metabolomics approaches with the kinetic informa-
tion that can only be ascertained through the use of isotopic
tracers.

2 EXPERIMENTAL REQUIREMENTS

To generate tracer-speciﬁc isotopic enrichment patterns of
metabolic intermediates, stable isotope-labeling experiments
have to be performed using the tracer of interest (Fig. l).
NTFD works with nearly all stable isotopic-labeled compounds,

Fig. 1. To detect the metabolic fate of a stable isotope tracer, two experi-
ments must be performed in parallel under identical conditions: for
the ﬁrst experiment, the biological system needs to be incubated with a
mixture of stable isotope-labeled tracer and unlabeled compound. For the
second experiment, the system needs to be incubated under the same
conditions with only unlabeled tracer

including uniformly or singly labeled carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur
tracers. In the case of deuterium, care must be taken, as the
deuterium effect may cause labeled and unlabeled compounds
to elute at different retention times from the GC (Turowski
et al., 2003). To reduce experimental noise, both experiments
should be performed simultaneously and in replicates, which
also enables NTFD to provide confidence intervals for each
mass isotopomer. NTFD accepts mass spectrometric data in
the common netCDF format, which is supported by nearly all
current GC/MS instruments as an export function.

3 RESULTS AND FEATURES

The NTFD software performs all the following steps automat-
ically to detect isotopically enriched compounds in GC/MS
datasets:

0 Ion chromatographic deconvolution and compound
detection

0 Compound pairing
0 MID calculation by solving linear equation systems

NTFD applies an ion chromatographic deconvolution algo-
rithm that we developed previously for the
MetaboliteDetector software (Hiller et al., 2009). Having de-
tected all compounds present in the recorded mass spectromet-
ric data, NTFD automatically pairs every compound detected
in the labeled chromatogram to its counterpart in the unlabeled

chromatogram based on retention time and mass spectral iden-
tity. This is the most critical step, because isotopic enrichment
signiﬁcantly changes the mass spectrum of a compound. As a
typical GC/MS chromatograms contains mass spectra of >400
compounds, such a pairing cannot be done by manual inspec-
tion. To detect isotopically enriched metabolites, NTFD calcu-
lates the integrated difference spectrum for each compound pair
(Hiller et al., 2010). Every labeled ion fragment is characterized
by a peak in the integrated difference spectrum, which is de-
tected and evaluated by our software. Finally, the software cal-
culates the MID for every detected and labeled fragment ion.
Typically, the sum formula of the fragment ion is applied to
calculate a correction matrix, which is needed to solve the linear
equation system for accurate MID calculation (Lee et al., 1991).
Because of the non-targeted character of the NTFD analysis,
such formulas are not available, and the software applies the
mass spectrum of the paired unlabeled compound to set-up the
correction matrix. For compounds with prevalent naturally
occurring isotopes, such as carbon, a further correction needs
to be applied. We have implemented an algorithm similar to the
one proposed by Jennings and Matthews (2005). If replicates
are provided, NTFD additionally calculates 95% conﬁdence
intervals and coefﬁcients of determination to facilitate statistical
evaluation of results. A full NTFD analysis can be performed
on a standard computer in several minutes.

4 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the NTFD software enables the detection of all
stable isotope-labeled compounds derived from the applied
tracer with a non-targeted approach. The C++- and Qt4-based
software provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface and
imports mass spectrometric data in the common netCDF
format. Having detected all labeled compounds, MIDs for all
compound ions are determined. If a reference spectrum library
is provided, NTFD identiﬁes as many compounds as possible.
Finally, the results can be exported to a tab-separated ﬁle (tsv),
which can be further processed with spreadsheet or statistics
applications.

framework, Osella et a]. (2011) study the so—called miRNA—
mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription
factor regulates an miRNA together with a set of target genes,
and the mathematical models studied by Loinger et a]. (2012)
additionally account for the concentration level of the argonaute
protein complex. Baker et a]. (2012) study analytically the impact
of multiple small non—coding RNAs on the regulation of a single
target mRNA and subsequently the dynamics of protein produc—
tion. Ragan et a]. (2011) combine the concept of miRNA binding
site accessibility with miRNA and mRNA concentration levels.
For [5], [I] and [ST] denoting the equilibrium (ﬁnal) concentra—
tions of the miRNA, target mRNA and of the hybridized struc—
ture, respectively, the authors use the equilibrium condition
[STJ/([S][TJ) = exp(—AAG/c), where AAG is the energy score
that accounts for making the binding site accessible and the free
energy of the hybridized structure (the constant c stands for the
product of the gas constant and the temperature). Combining the
equilibrium condition with conservation of mass equations (for
initial concentrations [So] and [T 0]) eventually leads to an ana—
lytical expression for [S] in terms of [So], [T 0] and AAG, where
the latter is calculated for a particular binding site. Marin and
Vanioek (2012) introduce a new accessibility—based algorithm
that uses a statistical analysis of all putative binding sites for a
given miRNA—3/UTR pair. Among the top 100 target predic—
tions for 153 fruit ﬂy miRNAs, the algorithm ﬁnds more than
twice as many validated targets compared with other accessibil—
ity—based target prediction methods. Reviews of existing miRNA
target prediction tools and information about latest develop—
ments can be found in Muniategui et a]. (2012) and Shirdel
et a]. (2011). The target prediction tool CoMeTa designed by
Gennarino et a]. (2012) operates on the assumption that targets
of a given miRNA are coexpressed with each other. The target
prediction score is based on the evaluation of thousands of pub—
licly available microarray data. For the 675 human miRNAs
analyzed in the study, >90% of the validated targets fall within
the ﬁrst 50% of predicted targets (which, however, could be a
large number). In a similar way, the tool miRror designed by
Balaga et a]. (2012) combines scores produced by an ensemble of
established miRNA target prediction tools with rankings ob—
tained from gene expression and HITS—CLIP data. Johnson
and Srivastava (2013) consider the problem of selecting an anti—
sense sequence that is able to effectively bind to a target mRNA
and block protein synthesis. One of the key features of the
authors’ method is the presuppositions that mRNA secondary
structures are in a constant state of ﬂux and are assuming dif—
ferent suboptimal states, which also determines the approach
taken in the present article. Johnson and Srivastava (2013) de—
signed a tool that generates and compares suboptimal secondary
structures of a given mRNA sequence. The comparison aims at
identifying regions that are least similar among the set of folded
structures, which indicates volatility in intramolecular hydrogen
bonding. Such regions are seen as candidates for antisense
binding. The method is evaluated on six mRNA sequences and
compared with results produced by the Soligo application of
Sfold (Ding et al., 2005).

In our article, we study miRNA bindings to sets of metastable
secondary structures induced by 3/UTRs and their mutated
counterparts, where the single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) are located within the miRNA binding site. Long et a].

(2007) brieﬂy mention the analysis of miRNA bindings to meta—
stable conformations. The authors compare the prediction
performance over samples of 1000 secondary structures without
constraints to samples of 100 metastable conformations. They
report the sample of 1000 conformations is more favourable.
In our approach, we discriminate between metastable conform—
ations with regard to depth and average opening energies.

The impact of SNPs on minimum free energy mRNA con—
formations has been comprehensively studied in Johnson et al.,
(2011). The authors analyzed a total number of 34 557 SNPs in
12450 genes. The minimum free energy conformations were
calculated by using RNAfo 1d (Gruber et al., 2008). The authors
provide a great variety of data about the distribution of SNPs
within mRNA transcripts and their effect on minimum free
energy values of secondary structures as well as on the proﬁle
of the ensemble of suboptimal structures and structures with high
Boltzmann probabilities, see also Johnson and Srivastava (2013),
Martin et a]. (2012) and Solomatin et a]. (2010) for the impact of
SNPs on the ensemble of secondary structures. The study
(Johnson et al., 2011) also includes the analysis of various subsets
of transcripts and SNPs, e. g. with respect to the transcript length
and different SNP types.

Martin et a]. (2012) study structural changes induced by SNPs
in the 5’UTR of the human FTL gene in conjunction with
associated SNPs that restore the overall wild—type ensemble of
secondary structures, thus leading to the notion of structure—sta—
bilizing haplotypes. The authors also analyzed the stabilizing
effect of multiple structure—stabilizing haplotypes on binding
sites of miRNAs and RNA binding proteins (nine cases of
3/UTRs and one case of 5/UTR). As pointed out by the authors,
the ﬁndings suggest that certain SNP pairs are conserved in the
human population because they stabilize ensembles of mRNA
conformations.

Recently, databases have become available that report SNP
data in the context of miRNA bindings, for example, miRdSNP
(Bruno et al., 2012), PolymiRTS (Ziebarth et al., 2012),
MicroSNiPer (Barenboim et al., 2010) and the related tool
RNAsnp (Sabarinathan et al., 2013). Sethupathy and Collins
(2008) critically assess several genetic association studies related
miRNA bindings and the potential impact of SNPs in bindings
regions. The authors highlight the importance of follow—up func—
tional experiments for a deeper understanding of the real effect
miRNA target site variations may have on the development of
various human diseases. Consequently, we researched for our
analysis the recent literature for studies on the impact of SNPs
on miRNA bindings meeting the following four conditions:
(i) the expression levels of both alleles involved are analyzed
experimentally by SNP genotyping (for some instances, a com—
bination of clinical association studies and strong in silico results)
or related methods involving PCR experiments, (ii) the under—
lying allele information can be extracted as consistent data from
the NCBI database, the dbSNP database and the Ensembl data—
base (3/UTR transcripts), (iii) the miRNA bindings are predicted
by the latest version of STarMir (Hammell et al., 2008) at least
for the allele with the stronger inhibitory effect with the SNP
position being inside the binding region and (iv) identifying all
metastable conformations within an energy offset 6E above mfe
conformations is computationally feasible (3/UTR length S
1000 nt). Meeting all four conditions at least to a certain extent

reduced the number of case studies we found to a small set of 14
RNA instances.

2 APPROACH

The present study assumes the existence of multiple active RNA
conformations instead of a unique minimum free energy con—
formation as the single biologically active state, see Johnson
and Srivastava (2013), Solomatin et a]. (2010) and the literature
therein. The second basic feature of our approach relates to the
presence of multiple copies of each individual mRNA. In more
detail, we proceed as follows for a given [mRNA; SNP; miRNA]
instance (a ﬂowchart of the approach is provided in
Supplementary Fig. S1 iPart I, Section 17A):

(A) For both alleles (3/UTR and SNP), the sets
MS(3/UTR,6E) and MS(SNP,6E) of metastable states
(MS states) within an energy offset 6E above the mfe con—
formation are identiﬁed by using RNAsubopt and
Barriers; cf. (Gruber et al., 2008; Wolﬁnger et al.,
2004; Wuchty et al., 1999). Alternative tools are, e.g.
(modified) version of RNAlocopt (Lorenz and Clote,
2011) and Regliss (Saffarian et al., 2012).

(B) STarMir (Hammell et al., 2008) is applied to both alleles
for the given miRNA. Although the 14 basic cases
[mRNA; SNP; miRNA] selected from recent literature
were analyzed in the corresponding publications by
prediction tools different from STarMir, we obtained
for each of the cases at least for one allele a binding site
predicted by STarMir with the SNP position inside.

(C) For the predicted binding site BS(miRNA), the elements
of the sets MS(3/UTR,6E) and MS(SNP,6E) are exam—
ined with respect to a number of basic features, such as
the number of base pair bindings within BS(miRNA) and
the approximate free energy AGBS of bindings within
BS(miRNA) according to standard data of the nearest
neighbour model (Chen et al., 2012; Mathews et al., 2004).

(D) Subsets of MS(- - - ,6E) are analyzed in the context of the
number of mRNA copies, as analyzed in Subkhankulova
et a]. (2008), in the same way as in (C), i.e. for k:20, 60,
100 the sets MS(- - - , k) C MS(- - - , (E) are examined,
where k indicates the assumption about the number of
mRNA copies. We note that the number of copies is
different from concentration levels, which are measured,
e.g. per mol, see Cuccato et a1. (2011).

For a given set of metastable secondary structures, the appli—
cation Msbind is available at http://kks.inf.kcl.ac.uk/MSbind.

is 903 nt. The authors analyze luciferase assays for measuring
expression levels and observe a stronger inhibitory effect of
miR—433—3p for the C—allele. We note that in this specific
case we used the submission ss20399075 instead of the default
dbSNP entry ss28476621 for consistency with the NCBI entry
of NM_019851.2 and the corresponding 3’UTR transcript
entry ENST00000180166 at ENSEMBL.

[HOXB5;rs9299;miR-7-5p]: The case is analyzed in Luo et a].

authors conjecture a stronger inhibitory effect of miR—197—3p
for the G—allele.

[ORAIl;rs76753792;miR-519a-3p]: The case is analyzed
in Chang et al. (2012). The SNP rs76753792 is defined by
C <—> T at 3/UTR position 86 of NM_032790.3. The 3/UTR
length is 1034 nt. The authors study the susceptibility of atopic
dermatitis in Japanese and Taiwanese populations. Among
other methods, real—time PCR is applied to gene expression
analysis. Chang et a]. (2012) mention the impact of miRNAs
as subject of future research, i.e. no speciﬁc miRNA is identi—
ﬁed. Based on miRNA target predictions for ORAIl and the
SNP position, we selected miR—519a—3p for the present study.
For miR—519a—3p, the binding prediction returned by
StarMir is stronger for the C—allele.

[RAP1A;rs6573;miR-196a]: The case is analyzed in Wang et al.

squamous cell carcinoma. The regulatory function of
miR—196a is analyzed by luciferase reporter assays. The
authors conclude a stronger inhibitory effect of miR—196a
for the A—allele.

The 3’UTR— and SNP—sequences were identiﬁed by using NCBI
databases and transcript information provided by ENSEMBL.
A detailed description of all instances in terms of ENSEMBL
ID codes is given in Supplementary Table S1 in Part I (Suppl—
Mat—I), Section I—B.

3 RESULTS

When executing step (A), we applied the standard settings of
RNAsubopt and Barriers, where isolated base pairings are
not permitted and free energy values are discriminated with an
accuracy of 0.1 kcal/mol. The setting of (SE depends on the length
of the 3’UTR and was selected in such a way that a sufﬁciently
large number of metastable conformations is available for ana—
lyzing MS(- - - , k) with k g 100. Along with the energy offset 6E,
we tried to restrict metastable states to ‘deep’ local minima: The
parameter D indicates the ‘depth’ of a local minimum or ‘escape
height’ from a local minimum, which is taken from the barrier
tree as the distance to the nearest saddle point. By |SecStrucw/S|
(short for both cases of |SecStruc,.mk| and |SecStrucS,,.0ng|) we
denote the number of secondary structures returned by
RNAsubopt for an offset 6E above the mfe conformation,
where the index w indicates the allele with the
weaker and s with the stronger miRNA inhibitory effect
(binding predictionifor [ORAI1;rs76753792;miR—519a—3p]).
Analogously, |MSw/S| is the number of local minima within the
(SE range with an ‘escape height’ larger or equal to D.

3.1 Number of metastable conformations

Results of step (A) with respect to 6E,D and |MSw/S| are
summarized in Table 1. For |SecStrucw/S|, the data are
provided in Supplementary Table S2 in Part I (Suppl—Mat—I),
Section I—C.

For 9 of the 14 instances, the values of |MSw| and |MSS| are
relatively close or (much) larger for |MSS|, see Table 1 and
Figure 1. For the remaining instances, the ratio |MSw|/|MSS|
ranges from 1.31 (FGF20) up until 6.47 (AGTR1). Thus, the
number of secondary structures classiﬁed as metastable conform—
ations per se does not discriminate between the two cases of
weaker and stronger binding to the associated miRNA.

match among all predictions having the SNP position inside,
leading in some cases to weaker AGIoIaI values. In case of a
missing strong seed match, the target predictions provided by
the PITA tool (Kertesz et al., 2007) are taken into account.

By |BPw| and |BPS|, we denote the number of base pairs in the
corresponding mfe conformation within the miRNA binding
region predicted by STarMir for an individual allele (w:
weak and s :strong allele with respect to miRNA binding).

Detailed information about the STarMir output is provided
in Supplementary Material Part II (Suppl—Mat—II), which also
includes PITA predictions and, where available, data provided
by FindTar (Ye et al., 2008); for target predictions by other
tools, please see Supplementary Material Part I (Suppl—Mat—I),
Section I—D. Except for IL—23 R (L : 851), the AGIoIaI predictions
by STarMir are stronger for the allele identified for stronger
miRNA bindings in the corresponding publication (cf. the row
for AAGIoI and description of instances in Section 2; we recall
that for ORAIl no particular miRNA is mentioned). Except for
LIG3 (L: 124), HTR3E (L: 302), HLA-G (L:386), IL—23R
(L: 851) and AGTR1 (L: 888), the absolute value of AGLIISWPI
is smaller for the allele with the stronger miRNA binding stated
in the corresponding publication (s—allele indicated in Table 2, see
also the row for AAGdIS). For IL—23R and AGTR1, the total
STarMir score is positive for both alleles, for IL—23R even with
AG’tvotal > AGibtal ‘

The instance [IL—23R;rs10889677;let—7e] has been analyzed in
Zwiers et al. (2012), with strong experimental evidence for an
inhibitory effect of let—7e on the C—allele. The binding patterns
for the C allele provided by STarMir (see Suppl—Mat—II) and
in Figure 3A of Zwiers et al. (2012) differ only slightly towards
the 5’ end of the C allele. We note that for the A allele we have
the only case in Table 2 where the SNP position is not within the
‘binding site’ predicted by STarMir. The PITA tool returns (the
equivalent of) AGIoIaI : —14.12 kcal/mol for the C allele, and
AGIoIaI : —10.02 kcal/mol for the A allele (see Suppl—Mat—II),
which is in line with the experimental data from Zwiers et al.
(2012). The absolute value of AGLIISWPI is also slightly smaller for
the C allele.

For [LIG3;rs4796030;miR—221], the absolute value of AGdismpI
is larger for the C allele by 4.19 kcal/mol, and there is no PITA
prediction with the SNP position inside the reported binding
region. The PITA predictions close to the SNP position favour
the C allele with respect to the total score and AGhybrId, which
complies with Teo et al. (2012). The selection of positions 7798
for the A allele and 8(P98 for the C allele is motivated by the
seed—like bindings predicted by STarMir, see Suppl—Mat—II.

For ORAIl, the positions 69788 were selected for the C allele
due to the larger value of AG;uCl : —4.32kcal/mol.

For [HTR3E;rs56109847;miR—510—5p], the AGhybrId values is
stronger for the G allele (s—case) by 6.2 kcal/mol, and the stronger
binding prediction is supported by PITA and FindTar (no
binding prediction for A alleleiw—case).

For [HLA—G;rs1063320;miR—148a—3p], PITA returns a
stronger total score for the G allele, which is in line with the
STarMir total score and experimental data from Tan et al.
(2007). The absolute value of AGLIISWPI is larger for the G allele
(by 1.12kcal/mol for PITA and 1.73 kcal/mol for STarMir).
FindTar also strongly supports the miRNA binding to the
G allele.

For [AGTR1;rs5186;miR—155—5p], the AGhybrId values is stron—
ger for the A allele (s—case) by 4.3 kcal/mol. The stronger binding
prediction for the A allele is supported by PITA and FindTar
(no binding prediction for C alleleiw—case).

For the 14 instances under consideration, the PITA predic—
tions either support (or improve for IL—23R) the STarMir pre—
dictions displayed in Table 2, or no predictions with the SNP
position inside the reported binding region are returned.

In summary, if STarMir and PITA (for IL—23R) are taken
together, the AGIoIaI predictions are stronger for the correspond—
ing allele (s—case) identiﬁed in the description of the 14 instances
in Section 2.

3.3 Analysis of metastable conformations

STarMir and PITA operate on sequences as input, not on
representations of secondary structures. Therefore, we use
RNAeval (Gruber et al., 2008) for the energy evaluation of
metastable conformations within binding regions predicted by
STarMir, which also complies with the data generated by
RNAsubopt and Barriers, see Table 1. To facilitate a coher—
ent analysis of energy values, we use energy values calculated
for binding regions within the corresponding mfe structure as
templates for comparisons, instead of using the associated
AGdismpI values reported in Table 2.

Let S denote a secondary structure (either mfe conformation
or metastable conformation) for a 3’UTR (wild—type or SNP—
type) listed in Table 1. By Sopen we denote the associated second—
ary structure where all base pair bindings within the miRNA
binding region reported in Table 2 are removed. For example,
if S is the mfe conformation of the 3’UTR of the C allele of
LIG3, then S has seven base pair bindings in positions 8(P98
(see Table 2), and the seven base—pair bindings are removed in
Sopen. For S being a metastable conformation, the number of
base pair bindings within the miRNA binding region can be
larger, the same or smaller in comparison with the corresponding
value reported in Table 2 for the mfe conformation. We then
deﬁne

rags.“ = Wars) — RNAeva1<sopen> <1>
MG... = we; — was: (2)

The index ‘ind’ speciﬁes the different cases we consider, and the
different values in (1) and (2) relate either to individual structures
or to average values (according to the value assigned to ‘ind’)
over sets of metastable conformations:

(i) ind :mfe indicates the single mfe conformation.

(ii) ind:tot indicates the average value over all metastable
conformations as counted in Table 1. For example,
AGES; stands for the average value over 317 metastable
conformations in case of the C allele of LIG3, see Table 1.

(iii) ind : N+ indicates for N: 20, 60 and 100 the N+meta—
stable conformations S with the N+lowest free energy
values calculated by RNAeval(S) that are above the mfe
conformation. Because each energy level usually adds
more than a single conformation, the notion ‘N+’
indicates that the highest energy level involved covers N
conformations above the mfe structure, plus in most cases

 

ﬁm'spzumoi‘pmjxo'sopeuuopnorq/ﬁdnq

MicroRNA binding sites and metastable RNA secondary stmctures

 

some more structures, i.e. the actual number N+ of
conformations can be slightly larger than N.

There are a few exceptions for 60+, where the number is
between 50 and 60, because the next energy level results
already in a conformation number above 100. For
example, for PARPl, 60+ means 55, because 55 conform—
ations are accumulated at energy level —186.4kcal/mol,
whereas level —186.3kcal/mol adds 48 conformations,
which leads to 100+ = 103.

Furthermore, we order the metastable conformations SmS with
respect to the absolute value of IAGopenl and the depth D(Sms)
(deepest first), respectively. As in (2), we define

discriminating between the two alleles involved for each instance.
Positive values of AAGmfe, AAGM, AAGN+, AAGZMNJr and
ADELE“ are interpreted as being in favour of the allele with the
stronger miRNA binding stated in the underlying literature
source, which is also the case for RNJr < 1.

For LIG3 (L: 124), HTR3E (L:302), HLA—G (L=386),
IL—23R (L: 851) and RAD51 (L:978), the data for
AAGmfe, AAG‘O‘, AAGN+ and AAGESCNJr shown in Table 3
are not in favour of the allele with the stronger miRNA binding
stated in the underlying literature (HOXB5 with L=952 not
included here, please see later in the text).

For LIG3, IL—23R and RAD51 the values of RNJr are either

close to or smaller than 1.00, and the values of ADELE“ are all

AAGZMNJr : A0212?“ _ AGglcezerzw (3) positive, suggesting more stable local minima for structures

where  denotes the average depth of the N+ deepest meta—
stable conformations. The index ‘asc’ in (3) indicates that, unlike
in (2), the N+ metastable conformations are ranked in ascending
order with respect to IAGopenl, and the average value is taken
over N+ conformations.

Finally, we combine ‘opening energies’, as deﬁned in (2) and
(3), with the depth D(Sms) of metastable conformations, as

defined by  and used in (4): We look at the average depth

of structures SmS with the N+ smallest values of IAGOPenl. Let

open open

For HLA—G, the values of RNJr are equal or close to 1.00, and
the values of ADgngn and ADégg: are positive. Moreover, the
AAGaSCzNJr—values shown in Table 3 are close to zero, and the
values of AAGN+ are in the range of AGﬁismp‘ — AGg’ismp‘ =
—1.73 kcal/mol from Table 2. Thus, for HLA—G the values of
AGE/y’lgﬁd shown in Table 2 seem to be decisive for an assessment

of a putative miR—148a—3p <—> HLA—G/rs1063320 binding (based
on prediction tools).
For HTR3E, only the values of ADELE are in favour of the

allele with the stronger miRNA binding stated in the underlying
literature. Unlike the case of HLA—G, the negative values of

Comprehensive information about the distribution of meta—
stable conformations and their respective energy values is
provided in Supplementary Material Part III. (Suppl—Mat—III).
In Table 3 we report representative data that are useful for

and ADELE (Table 3) support the binding to the G allele (s—case).

For HOXB5 (L:952), the AAGN+ values are negative yet
close to zero, and the AAGESQNJr values support the stronger
miRNA binding to the A—allele (s—case), which makes the
HOXB5 instance different from the five instances discussed

earlier in the text. The RNJr values are close to 1.00, and ADégg:
is positive.

For RAPlA (L: 1078), the STarMir predictions for
AGdismp‘ and AGhybrid, respectively, are close for both alleles.
The SNP at position 366 is located in the middle of a loop
(positions 363369) in both mfe secondary structures, which
leads to identical values of AGijnpf‘eﬁ/W and related features.
Therefore, similar to HTR3E, Awabﬁd and AGfml from
Table 2 appear to determine the evaluation of miR—196a <—>
RAPlA/rs6573 bindings.

For CBRl (L:284), WFSl (L: 779), RYR3 (L: 880),
AGTR1 (L: 888), FGF20 (L: 903) and ORAIl (L : 1034), the
data for AAGmfe, AAGM, AAGN+ and AAGamNJr (Table 3) are
all in favour of the allele with the stronger miRNA binding stated
in the underlying literature. However, for each of the ﬁve instances
at least one of the two parameters RNJr and ADELE“ does not fully
support the predicted binding.

For RYR3, only ADE]; : —0.26 kcal/mol is clearly not in
favour of the predicted binding. Similarly, the values of ADELE“

do not support the predicted stronger binding for CBRl. For
ORAIl, this is the case for the RNJr values and AD100+ : —0.05

open
kcal/mol, but with a relatively strong value of ADE]; : +0.75
kcal/mol. For AGTR1, all three values of ADNJr are clearly in

open
favour of the predicted binding pattern. The instances WFS1 and
FGF20 are the only two cases where for all N+values both
parameters do not support the predicted stronger binding.

Finally, for PARPl (L:769) all energy values shown in
Table 3 support the stronger miRNA binding to the T—allele
(S—case).

We recall that for the instance ORAIl from Chang et al.
(2012) no individual miRNA is identiﬁed in the literature
source. For ORAIl and miRNA—519a—3p, the two binding sites
predicted by STarMir intersect only by 8nt, with a positive
value AGwml : 5.62 kcal/mol for the T—allele (w—case), which
suggests that no binding occurs. Although RN+>1.00 for all
cases of N+ considered, we obtain strong positive values for
AAGmfe, AAG‘O‘, AAGN+ and AAGaSCzNJr, along with the
STarMir predictions AGwml : —7.21 kcal/mol and AGnucl :
—4.32 kcal/mol for the C—allele (s—case). Moreover, the data for
ADNJr are AD10+ :0.89 kcal/mol, ADELE] :0.75kcal/mol

open open
and AD60+ : 0.08 kcal/mol, which support a binding of miR—

open

519a—3p to the 3’UTR of ORAIl.

Table 4. Summary of discrimination between WT and SNP alleles

4 CONCLUSION

Of the 14 instances we analyzed, 13 instances are sensitive to
the parameters AAGind, AAGasczNJr, RNJr and ADELE“ we
introduced in Equation (1) until Equations (5). For RAPlA
(L: 1078), slightly larger values of (SE did not create differences
between basic parameters for both alleles and eventually led to
an unmanageable size of data for standard desktop computer
configurations.

The absence of experimental data about copy numbers of
mRNA transcripts considered in the present study prevents the
selection of a particular value of ADELE“ (or of the other two
highlighted parameters), which is why we considered three
representative values of N+ simultaneously, without calculating
P—values. The upper bound of N : 100+ is motivated by the data
provided in Subkhankulova et al. (2008), see Figure 3B there.

The data provided in Table 3 indicate that AAGmfe,
AAG‘O‘, AAGN+ not necessarily contribute to a deeper insight
into miRNA binding patterns to different alleles, see also the
discussion of instances in Section 3.3. In particular, AAGM
and AAGN+ are related only to free energy values of metastable
structures, which is why a further discrimination by the depth of
metastable conformations and the opening energy of binding
regions was introduced. Consequently, we focus in the summary
of findings presented in Table 4 on the values calculated for
AAGasczN+a RN+ and 

In Table 4, the row ‘StarMir(total)’ indicates by ‘+’ that the
AGwml score (see Table 2) supports the allele with the stronger
miRNA binding stated in the underlying literature; ‘+/+’ indi—
cates 0<AGfmall < AGl‘éml. As aforementioned, data about
estimations of copy numbers are not available for the mRNA
transcripts we consider in the present study. To avoid the
inclusion of irrelevant data (by averaging or thresholding),
we consider a ‘best case scenario’ for each instance: We select
a value of N+ in such a way that the support of the miRNA
binding to the allele identiﬁed in the underlying literature source
(s—case) is maximized. In case of multiple N+ values (for 11 in—
stances same pattern as in Table 4 for at least two N+), the
smallest N+ is selected and named in Table 4 in the row ‘N+
selection’.

For the selected N+, the Table 4 entry is labelled as positive
‘+’, if AAGESQNJr and ADELE“ are positive, respectively, or
RNJr <1.00. If the data are inconclusive (equal or close to 0.00
or 1.00), we use ‘+/+’. For example, for HLA—G we select

N+ 2 60+ and obtain from Table 3 the entries for Table 4 as
follows: AAGaSCNJr = +/ — , RNJr = +/—, and ADELE : +.
Table 4 demonstrates that the combined measure ADE’PE
defined in (5) is the best match to the binding predictions, with
two inconclusive and two negative values. The inconclusive value
of ADEEE for CBRl is accompanied by two positive values of
the other two parameters, and RAPlA is a special instance due
to the SNP location, as discussed in Section 3.3. The negative
values of ADE‘EE for WFS1 and FGF20 are accompanied by
relatively strong positive values of AAGaSCZzOJr. Future research
will include to establish a suitable total score that takes into
account weighted partial scores provided by AAGasczNJr, RNJr

and ADE’PE. For example, the simple weight selection

—1 E —, 0 E :l: and 1 E + applied to Table 4 results in a total
score of —1 for HTR3E and FGF20, and a total score of 0 for
WFS1, RAD51 and RAPlA. However, WFS1 has a strong
AAGaSCNJr score, RAD51 has a strong ADE’PE score and
RAPlA is a special case due to the location of the SNP. The
relatively strong score of AAGaSCNJr could outweigh the other
two scores. HTR3E remains an ambiguous case, see also the
discussion of the HTR3E+miR—510—5p instance in Sethupathy
and Collins, (2008).

We hypothesize that an in—depth analysis of metastable con—
formations based on parameters such as AAGasczNJr, RNJr and
ADE’PE can provide useful information for the assessment of
putative miRNA+mRNA bindings in the context of SNPs. In
the literature sources, we researched for the current study, the
number of genes and miRNAs exposed to experimental analysis
is relatively small, yet each analysis is time—consuming and costly.
Examining features of metastable conformations in a preprocess—
ing step of wet lab experiments may improve the conﬁdence
about expected miRNA+mRNA bindings. We emphasize that
for ORAIl no speciﬁc miRNA is identified by Chang et a].
(2012). The data we presented support the binding of miR—
519a—3p to the 3’UTR of ORAIl in the region of position 86.

In the present study, the energy values associated with the
accessibility of binding sites are approximated by using
RNAeval, and the range of the binding sites is directly adapted
from STarMir. In future research, we aim at individual
miRNA+mRNA binding predictions over samples of metastable
conformations taken from the sets of secondary structures defin—
ing the values of AAGasczNJr, RNJr and ADE’PE.

The approach presented in the current study is clearly limited
by the vast amount of secondary structures returned by
RNAsubopt for longer sequences. Because we are aiming at
the applicability of Msbind by using standard hardware facil—
ities, we are seeking for alternative ways of identifying metastable
conformations, with preference given to approximation methods,
where at the cost of completeness (within an acceptable error
range) metastable conformations are calculated within a feasible
time. Future research will also include to investigate haplotypes
and miRNA bindings, as discussed in Martin et al. (2012), and
the analysis of SNPs in miRNAs, see (Johnson et al., 2011).
Furthermore, we plan to examine data provided by eQTL studies
as an additional source of experimental data bearing information
about the effect of SNPs on miRNA bindings to putative targets.
For example, Westra et a]. (2013) report that trans—eQTL SNPs
are enriched within miRNA binding sites in blood cell lines

studied in the article, see Figure 1 in Westra et al. (2013).
Although in the present study we focus on miRNA binding
within 3’UTRs, we also plan to look into the case where
miRNA binding sites near the terminal coding region along
with the presence of SNPs may affect the overall 2D or 3D
structure (The authors are grateful to an anonymous referee
for pointing out the potential of eQTL studies as well as the
importance of miRNA binding sites near terminal coding regions
in the context of miRNA bindings to metastable RNA
conformations.).

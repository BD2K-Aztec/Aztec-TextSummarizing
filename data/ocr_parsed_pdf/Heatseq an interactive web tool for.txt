Abstract

Summary: Better protocols and decreasing costs have made high—throughput sequencing experi—
ments now accessible even to small experimental laboratories. However, comparing one or few ex—
periments generated by an individual lab to the vast amount of relevant data freely available in the
public domain might be limited due to lack of bioinformatics expertise. Though several tools,
including genome browsers, allow such comparison at a single gene level, they do not provide a
genome—wide view. We developed Heat*seq, a web—tool that allows genome scale comparison of
high throughput experiments chromatin immune—precipitation followed by sequencing, RNA—
sequencing and Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) provided by a user, to the data in the public do—
main. Heat*seq currently contains over 12 000 experiments across diverse tissues and cell types in
human, mouse and drosophila. Heat*seq displays interactive correlation heatmaps, with an ability
to dynamically subset datasets to contextualize user experiments. High quality figures and tables
are produced and can be downloaded in multiple formats.

1 Introduction

High throughput sequencing is now becoming routine for many bio—
logical assays including transcriptome analysis through RNA—
sequencing (RNA—seq), or transcription factor (TF) binding sites
identification through chromatin immuno—precipitation followed by
sequencing (ChIP—seq). Additionally, collaborative projects such as
Bgee (Bastian et al.), ENCODE (Bernstein et (11., 2012) and
Roadmap Epigenomics (Kundaje et (11., 2015) have generated
genome—wide datasets across hundreds of cell types or tissues.
Despite this large data being freely available in the public domain,
the lack of computational tools accessible to experimental scientists
with no or elementary computational skills prohibits the use of this
data to its full potential for discovery.

Though genome browsers, including summary tracks provided by
many consortia, are extremely useful to study a few genes, promoters
or single nucleotide polymorphisms, they lack the genome—wide over—
view. Only a few public resources such as the CODEX database
(Sénchez—Castillo et (11., 20153) and the BLUEPRINT GenomeStats
tool (Zerbino et (11., 2014) allow a genome—wide comparison with the
user data. We therefore developed Heat*seq, a free, open source, web
application providing fast and interactive comparison against high
throughput sequencing experiments in the public domain. Users can
upload a processed text file containing either gene expression value
(Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million (FPKM) or Tags Per
Million (TPM)), peak coordinates or peak coordinates and corres—
ponding expression value for CAGE(Cap Analysis of Gene

Expression). The application provides clustered correlation heatmaps,
summarising global similarities between all samples in the dataset and
the user sample. Heat*seq provides over 12 000 publicly available
genome—wide experiments in human, mouse and drosophila for fast
and interactive comparison. In summary, Heat*seq is an interactive
web tool that allows users to contextualize their sequencing data with
respect to vast amounts of public data in a few minutes without
requiring any programming skills.

2 Methods

2.1 Data collection

We collected gene expression data (RNA—seq), TF ChIP—seq data and
CAGE data (over 4000 individual experiments) from Bgee (Bastian
et (11., 2008), Blueprint epigenome (Pradel et (11., 2015), CODEX
(Sanchez—Castillo et al., 2015b), ENCODE (Bernstein et (11., 2012),
FANTOM5 (Forrest et (11., 2014), FlyBase (Attrill et (11., 2016), GTEx
(Lonsdale et (11., 2013), modENCODE (Celniker et (11., 2009) and
Roadmap Epigenomics (Bernstein et (11., 2010), in human, mouse and
drosophila. Data formatting was done using R (R scripts available on
GitHub). The source for each dataset is listed in Supplementary Table
S1. Heatmaps represent Pearson’s correlation values between experi—
ments calculated using a Gene x Experiment numeric matrix with
gene expression values for expression data (log scaled), a Genomic re—
gions >< Experiments binary matrix indicating presence or absence of
a peak for TF ChIP—seq data and a Genomic regions >< Experiments
numeric matrix of expression values for CAGE data (log scaled).
Importantly, we constructed a metadata table which provides a web—
link to original data and allows users to sub select each dataset.

2.2 Web—application development

Heat*seq is an R shiny open source interactive tool which computes cor—

relation values between the user file and each experiment in a dataset.
Detailed user instructions are on the application website.

3 Results

3.1 Application description

Heat*seq tool supports three data types: HeatRNAseq,
HeatChIPseq and HeatCAGEseq. Data upload, correlation calcula—
tion and heatmap generation takes about a minute. Importantly,
users can interactively sub select relevant experiments using the
metadata information (e.g. cell type, TF name). The interactive heat—
map also allows selecting different clustering methods as well as
zooming in and out on the heatmap. The high resolution figures and
tables can be downloaded in multiple formats. Thus, Heat*seq pro—
vides global overview of relationships between public experiments
and the user data. Four user scenarios are discussed below.

3.2 User scenarios

3.2.1 User data quality control

We compared a Neocortex, 10 days post—partum (Ray et (11., 2015)
RNA—seq sample with Bgee mouse RNA—seq data using
HeatRNAseq. The top five correlation values (Pearson Correlation
Coefficient > 0.9) correspond to Bgee brain samples (Supplementary
Table S2). Thus, Heat*seq can be used as a fast data quality check
for next—generation sequencing data.

Fig. 1. Correlations heatmaps from Heat*seq. (A) ERor ChlP-seq in MCF7 cells
from Zhuang et al. is closer to ENCODE ERor ChlP-seq in T-47D than in ECO-1
cells. (B) BRF1 and RNA Pollll bind tRNA genes, but nor BRF2. (C) c-MYC
ChlP-seq in H1-hESC from UT-A and Stanford show low correlation. The col-
our key next to B is for A, B and C. (D) Two erythroblast RNA-seq samples
from BLUEPRINT are closely related to endothelial cells

selecting ENCODE ER ChIP—seq experiments revealed that the bind—
ing pattern of ERor in MCF7 cells was more similar to its binding
pattern in T—47D cells than in ECC—1 cells (Fig. 1A). MCF7 and T—
47D were derived from mammary tumours while ECC—1 is an endo—
metrial cell line.

3.2.3 New hypotheses by data integration

CpG islands (CGI) from the UCSC (Karolchik et (11., 2004) compari—
son to HeatChIPseq found that RNA polymerase II and TAF1
(Supplementary Table S4) were enriched at CGIs, as ~50% of
human gene promoters contain a CGI (Illingworth and Bird, 2009).
Interestingly, we identified factors avoiding CGIs including MAFK,
GATA3 and ZNF274.

Similarly, tRNA promoters were highly correlated with RNA
polymerase III, and its co—factors BDP1, RPC155 and BRF1
(Supplementary Table S4) using HeatChIPseq. Interestingly, com—
parison with BRF family data revealed that BRF1, but not BRF2
was bound at tRNA genes (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

3.2.4 Public data assessment
Heat*seq can be used to assess data in the public domain, high—
lighted by two examples below amongst others:

A MYC ChIP—seq in H1—hESC cells does not cluster with other
ENCODE MYC ChIP—seq experiments (Fig. 1C), including H1—
hESC sample from a different experimental group (Devailly et (11.,
2015

Two out of seven erythroblast RNA—seq samples from the
Blueprint Epigenome consortium are more correlated with endothe—
lial cells than with the rest of the erythroblast samples (Fig. 1D).

4 Conclusion

With Heat*seq, comparing RNA—seq, ChIP—seq or CAGE experi—
ments to hundreds of publicly available datasets becomes a trivial
task. Researchers can now investigate the relationships between

various high—throughput sequencing experiments fast and inter—
actively without requiring any programming skills. Such analysis
can assess data quality, cell variability and generate novel regulatory
hypotheses.

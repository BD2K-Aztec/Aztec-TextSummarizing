ABSTRACT

Summary: Peptide identification algorithm is a major bottleneck for
mass spectrometry based chemical cross-linking experiments. Our
lab recently developed an intensity-incorporated peptide identification
algorithm, and here we implemented this scheme for cross-linked
peptide discovery. Our program, SQID-XLink, searches all regular,
dead-end, intra and inter cross-linked peptides simultaneously, and
its effectiveness is validated by testing a published dataset. This new
algorithm provides an alternative approach for high conﬁdence
cross-linking identification.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry is a
powerful approach to analyze protein structures and interactions
(Rinner et al., 2008; Sinz et al., 2003). In such an experiment,
spatially adjacent amino acid residues from one or more proteins
are covalently linked by chemical reagents. The cross-linked
proteins are then enzymatically digested and the resulting
cross-linked peptide pairs can be detected by mass spectrometry.
Identiﬁcation of these cross-linked peptides enables researchers
to deﬁne the interaction sites of proteins in a complex in their
native states and to build or conﬁrm structural models.
Compared with traditional techniques such as NMR and
X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry-based chemical
cross-linking does not require a large quantity of sample (Lee,
2008). Moreover, recent development of high-resolution and
high-throughput mass spectrometers such as the Orbitrap have
offered increased efﬁciency and sensitivity required for the iden-
tification of cross-linked peptides.

Although the chemical cross-linking approach is promising,
the data analysis for chemical cross-linking forms a major
limitation for this technique (Lee, 2008). This is mainly because
cross-linked sequences are non-linear, thus traditional protein
database search algorithms such as Sequest (Eng et al., 1994)
and XlTandem (Craig and Beavis, 2004) cannot be directly

employed. The development of new database searching
algorithms enables more and more protein identiﬁcation from
a single shot-gun proteomics experiment; however, these novel
approaches have seldom implemented a cross-linking search
function to increase the number of identiﬁed cross-linked pep-
tides. Moreover, many current cross-linking algorithms are slow,
lack graphical user interfaces and need extensive manual data
interpretation before and after the search. These shortcomings
motivated us to make a powerful and user-friendly tool to iden-
tify cross-linked peptides.

Here we report the implementation of our recently developed
peptide identification algorithm, SQID (Li et al., 2011), to
cross-linked peptide identiﬁcation (SQID-XLink). Our algorithm
features an intensity incorporated scoring function: when a
strong peak in a spectrum agrees with the statistical value, the
confidence will be boosted. For example, if a CID-induced cleav-
age occurs N—terminal to proline or C-terminal to glutamic acid
or aspartic acid, the score will be higher. This is similar to manu-
ally checking a spectrum to conﬁrm if the strong peaks are from
cleavages expected to lead to abundant peaks. Due to the low
abundance of cross-linked peptides and corresponding poorer
spectral quality, incorporating intensity into cross-linking
search algorithms will be potentially very beneficial. In addition,
SQID-XLink searches all regular, dead-end (cross-linked at only
one reactive site of the cross-linker), intra-peptide (cross-linked
at two locations within a single peptide) and inter-peptide
cross-links simultaneously with the same scoring function, so
that the probability of false identiﬁcation can be minimized.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

SQID-XLink is a modified version of SQID which is speciﬁc-
ally designed for cross-linking searches. It is written in C
language with a user-friendly interface from Visual basic 6.0. It
has been tested in Windows XP and Windows 7 operating
systems. Currently, the program supports BS2G—d0/d4 (Bis
[Sulfosuccinimidyl] glutarate), BS3—d0/d4 (Bis[Sulfosuccinimidyl]
suberate) and EDC(l-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]—
carbodiimide) cross-linkers.

SQID-XLink processes a fasta database by generating regular
peptides, and peptides with a variable modiﬁcation of the mass
of dead-end or intra-peptide cross-linker. Peptides containing
cross-linkable residues are extracted and paired through combin-
ation of any two peptides. During the search, the two peptides
in a cross-linkable pair are linearized into two sequences by put-
ting one sequence before the other (AB and Vice versa BA)

and searched respectively, as reported by Maiolica et a]. (2007).
Ions generated by cleaving the sequences between the cross-
1inkab1e locations are excluded and the search results of the
two linearized sequences are combined as the final result
of for cross-linked peptide pair. The ﬁnal SQID-XLink score
is calculated as:

K
I + Z Pr,-
i=1

1 + K x 0.155 (1)
where m is the number of matched peaks, Pr is the probability for
a certain amino acid pair to have strong peaks (stored in a table)
and K is the number of most intense peaks used to calculate the
intensity score ZPr [K depends on the mass of peptide, and
equals the integer portion of (2+mass/330)]. The term (1+
ZPr)/(1 + 0.155K) measures whether the observed intensity (the
numerator) is better than the expected value (the
denominator).The function is similar to the SQID scoring func-
tion except that consecutive ion series are not used. This is be-
cause consecutive ion series tend to greatly increase the
conﬁdence when a part of the whole peptide sequence is
matched, but cross-linked peptides involve two independent se-
quences. The Pr table and a more detailed explanation of
Equation (1) can be found in Li et a]. (2011).

3 RESULTS

A published EDC cross-linking dataset (McIlwain et al., 2010;
Singh et al., 2008) of human cytochrome P450 2E1 (P450) and
cytochrome b5 (B5) was used to test the program. The dataset
contains 3314 spectra, and was collected using an LTQ—Orbitrap
with high resolution for both the precursor and M82 masses. The
search was performed with three missed cleavages and a 50 ppm
precursor and 20 ppm fragment m/z tolerance against both the
target and decoy version of the database. The decoy database
was built with reverse sequences of the two proteins plus twice
the number of randomized sequences, with 5.4 times larger
search space compared with the target database. Figure 1a
shows a plot of score versus precursor m/z error. The majority
of high score hits observed have a precursor mass error within
—5 to 20 ppm, and decoy hits have a maximum score of 3.22. As
a result, using —5 to 20 ppm and a score of 3.22 as a threshold
should give a false discovery rate (FDR) close to 0. With these
parameters, we discovered 163 high conﬁdence peptide-spectrum
matches, with 140 from non-cross-linked tryptic peptides, 22
from cross-linked peptides and 1 from intra—peptide cross-links.
The minimum score for matched cross-linked peptides was 4.45,
which is far above the threshold used. Figure 1b summarizes the
unique cross-linked peptides that are assigned by SQID-XLink,
and comparison with a popular cross-linking search engine,
xQuest (Rinner et al., 2008), as well as comparison with previ-
ously published results from Crux (Table 2, McIlwain et al.,
2010) and Popitam (Table 1, Singh et al., 2008). XQuest was
searched using the same parameters as SQID-XLink and the
FDR was determined with the same target-decoy database
search strategy. We use published Popitam and Crux results dir-
ectly instead of using our own search results because Popitam
needs an additional algorithm to pre-ﬁlter the data and needs

extensive manual interpretation to associate the modiﬁcation
mass with peptide sequence, while Crux relies on its own FDR
estimation system which needs the optimization of many param-
eters. The published data were already optimized by the authors
and manually veriﬁed, so they represent the best performance
of the two algorithms. Our results show that SQID-XLink can
identify a larger number of cross-linked peptides at high
conﬁdence. The two intra—protein cross-linked products
(GTVVVPTLDSVLYDNQEFPDPEK, FKPEHFLNENGK)
and (LYTMDGITVTVADLFFAGTETTSTTLR, YGLLIL
MKYPEIEEK) in Table 2 of the reference McIlwain et a].
(2010) are matched to linear peptides with missed cleavages by
both SQID-XLink and xQuest. The spectra of these products as
well as a complete list of identiﬁed peptides by SQID-XLink,
Crux (from our own searches) and xQuest can be found in the
Supplementary Material. In terms of speed, the total search time
including database processing was only 2.3 min for SQID-XLink
and 6.5 min for Crux, on a 64-bit computer with Intel Xeon
2.4GHz cpu (Crux only works on 64-bit computer), while it
took 3&127min for the xQuest webserver, depending on the
server load.

SQID-XLink demonstrated its ability to identify more cross-
linked peptides at high conﬁdence. In addition, SQID-XLink is
fast and has an easy-to-use graphical user interface. More
cross-linker support and better Visualization of the results will

Abstract

Summary: e23D, a database of A—to—I RNA editing sites from human, mouse and fly mapped to evo—
lutionary related protein 3D structures, is presented. Genomic coordinates of A—to—I RNA editing
sites are converted to protein coordinates and mapped onto 3D structures from PDB or theoretical
models from ModBase. e23D allows visualization of the protein structure, modeling of recoding
events and orientation of the editing with respect to nearby genomic functional sites from data—

bases of disease causing mutations and genomic polymorphism.

1 Introduction

A—to—I RNA editing, the deamination of adenosine t0 inosine by
ADAR family of enzymes, is the most widespread modification in
the human transcriptome (Levanon et (11., 2004). Most of the RNA
editing sites are located in non—coding regions such as introns and
3’UTRs. Still, several RNA editing sites are found in coding regions
and likely change amino—acid sequence, as inosine is identified as
guanosine by the translation machinery (Nishikura, 2009). These
recoding sites were proved to be important for normal development.
Adar2 Knock—out mice suffered from epileptic seizures and died at a
very early age as a result of lack in editing, specifically at the Q—to—R
site in Gria2. Changes in editing level at recoding sites in the sero—
tonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) were found to be related to depression,
schizophrenia and suicide (Iwamoto et (11., 2009). Recoding event
from S—to—G at AZIN1 was found to result in hepatocellular carcin—
oma (Chen et (11., 2013). Recently, it was found that most of the
non—synonymous editing sites in human seem to have a deleterious
effect (Xu and Zhang, 2014). Most edited sites tend to have strong
destabilization effect on the protein structure (Solomon et (11.,
2014). Still, some coding RNA editing sites have a functional rule,

are edited in a significant level and located at critical sites of the pro—
tein structure.

Several comprehensive databases which gather genomic data,
evolutionary context, expression data and editing level for editing
sites were recently developed. These include DARNED (Kiran et (11.,
2013), RADAR (Ramaswami and Li, 2014) and Inosinome atlas
(Picardi et (11., 2015). Still, there is a need for computational tools
for convenient intersection of RNA editing information with protein
structural and functional information. The current gap impedes
most biologists working in RNA editing field from inferring the
functional significance of editing event in the context of protein 3D
structural data. Here, we present e23D, a tool which is intended to
bridge this gap, and provide the community with user—friendly data—
base and web interface to spot and visualize protein modifications
resulted from A—to—I RNA editing events.

2 e23D database

e23D contains information regarding millions of editing sites col—
lected from RADAR database. Currently we store RADAR data

regarding editing sites in human, mouse and fly (2,576,459 human
sites, 8823 mouse sites and 5025 ﬂy sites). Human RNA editing sites
were also downloaded from the inosinome atlas (2,999,833 human
sites). The entire information is stored as a rational database on
MySQL server. For each organism (human, mouse and ﬂy) a table
with all editing sites, their read coverage, editing level and additional
information is maintained. This data architecture allows relatively
quick searches and is used for initial query of editing site informa—
tion in the e23D front page. As shown in Figure 1A, UCSC gene an—
notations are used to connect the stored genomic coordinates with
transcripts and protein coordinates. Protein sequences are aligned to
PDB sequences using Blast. S2C (httpz//dunbrack.fccc.edu/Guoli/
s2c/) is used to convert SEQRES with ATOM coordinates in the
PDB files. e23D will be updated routinely following updates of the
source editing sites databases.

3 e23D interface

At the e23D front page (httpz//www.sheba—cancer.org.il/e23D) the
user can select between different organisms: human, mouse or ﬂy
(Fig. 1B). Editing sites can be searched according to gene symbol,
genomic interval and number of reads that cover the editing sites or
editing level. Alternatively, the user can choose to view all the cod—
ing editing sites. In the following page a table with editing sites
matching the search criteria, is retrieved (Fig. 1C). By selecting one
site, all PDB structures which satisfactory aligned to its protein are

retrieved. The user can next filter the alignments between the pro—
tein sequence in Uniprot and sequences from PDB which are listed,
by different options. One of the most important features of e23D is
the ability to interactively explore the structural context of the
amino acid change. The user can visualize each aligned structure in
a JSmol session (Fig. 1D), in which all editing sites in this protein are
colored. For human editing site, variants from dbSNP, ClinVar and
Cosmic can be identified (Fig. 1D). It was recently suggested that
RNA editing contributes to tumor heterogeneity in addition to som—
atic mutations (Paz—Yaacov et 41]., 2015). Specifically, COPA I—to—V
site was found to be hypo—edited in multiple cancers (Chan et 41].,
2014; Paz—Yaacov et 41]., 2015 ). Interestingly, this same I—to—V
change in COPA is included in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations
in Cancer (Cosmic) (Fig. 1C) and additional somatic mutations are
found in close proximity to this editing site (Fig. 1D). These ex—
amples highlight the value of showing both disease causing muta—
tions and RNA editing sites together. Model of the new amino acid
introduced by the editing can be shown. A list of contacts with the
original or the modified amino—acid can also be accessed from this
page. The user can also view the alignment between the query se—
quence and the actual sequence of the 3D structure (Fig. 1E). This
alignment allows close examination of the sequence—structure rela—
tions alongside additional layers of information. Residues can be se—
lected on the sequence and viewed on the structure allowing
convenient exploration of the protein. Conservation scores of each
amino—acid, disorder profiles and prosite motifs are shown below

the alignment. Detailed documentation pages are provided in the
e23D website and are available for download.

To the best of our knowledge, e23D is the first database which
integrates A—to—I RNA editing sites with available protein 3D struc—
ture information.

We hope that the availability of this tool will progress the use of
structural information by the RNA editing community and make
coding RNA editing research more effective.

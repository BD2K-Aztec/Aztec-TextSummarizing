Abstract

Motivation: Pathway analysis to reveal biological mechanisms for results from genetic association
studies have great potential to better understand complex traits with major human disease impact.
However, current approaches have not been optimized to maximize statistical power to identify en—
riched functions/pathways, especially when the genetic data derives from studies using platforms
(e.g. Immunochip and Metabochip) customized to have pre—selected markers from previously iden—
tified top—rank loci. We present here a novel approach, called Minimum distance—based Enrichment
Analysis for Genetic Association (MEAGA), with the potential to address both of these important
concerns.

Results: MEAGA performs enrichment analysis using graphical algorithms to identify sub—graphs
among genes and measure their closeness in interaction database. It also incorporates a statistic
summarizing the numbers and total distances of the sub—graphs, depicting the overlap between
observed genetic signals and defined function/pathway gene—sets. MEAGA uses sampling technique
to approximate empirical and multiple testing—corrected P—values. We show in simulation studies
that MEAGA is more powerful compared to count—based strategies in identifying disease—associated
functions/pathways, and the increase in power is influenced by the shortest distances among associ—
ated genes in the interactome. We applied MEAGA to the results of a meta—analysis of psoriasis
using Immunochip datasets, and showed that associated genes are significantly enriched in
immune—related functions and closer with each other in the protein—protein interaction network.

1 Introduction

 

In the past decade, association studies have been used to investigate
genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases (McCarthy et al.
2008). Studies ranging from genotyping—based genome—wide associ—
ation studies (GWAS; WTCCC 2007; Yang et al. 2010) to large—
scale meta—analyses 0f GWAS (Liu et al. 2013; Teslovich et al.
2010), to the more recent next—generation sequencing—based

association analysis (Tang et al. 2013; Zhan et al. 2013), have facili—
tated the identification of genetic susceptibility loci for different
traits and diseases. However, identification of the underlying biolo—
gical mechanisms from these powerful datasets has not always been
straightforward.

To better understand these underlying biological mechanisms, it
has been asked whether the identified loci contain genes enriched in

certain gene—sets such as genes annotated with biological functions
[e.g. Gene Ontology: GO (Ashburner et al. 2000)] or pathways [e.g.
KEGG (Kanehisa et al. 2012)]. It would also be possible to investi—
gate if their encoding proteins could physically interact to form func—
tional units such as heterodimeric cytokines (e.g. IL23A and IL12B
as sub—units of cytokine IL23) or transcription factor complexes
(e.g. p53). While advances in genotyping technology have greatly
increased the power of available datasets, the development of opti—
mal strategies to bridge between genetic and functional results re—
mains a major theoretical and experimental goal of genetics
research.

Depending on the genotyping platform being used, loci densities
and genomic distribution of the markers in the association analysis
might vary. One of the challenges in enrichment testing is to select
the proper set of background markers/genes as ‘null’ observations to
approximate its overlap against the gene—set in question. Previous
studies have proposed different strategies to approximate the null
observations: ALIGATOR (Holmans et al. 2009) randomly samples
markers from the original platform to mimic its empirical marker
distribution; INRICH (Lee et al. 2011) exhibits a sampling strategy
using genomic interval as unit, and the sampled intervals are con—
strained to have similar marker and gene densities as those from the
input intervals (i.e. susceptibility loci). Each of the sampled null ob—
servations from the above approaches would be used to construct
empirical distributions for the numbers of overlap with functional
gene—sets, and used to estimate the statistical significance of the
observed data.

Both of the above count—based approaches enumerate the num—
ber of associated genes overlapping with each gene—set and work
well (Holmans et al. 2009; Sklar et al. 2011) in identifying biological
functions or pathways if the platform was designed in genome—wide
scale (i.e. most common genetic markers are well—tagged by the gen—
otyped markers). Recently, cost—effective genotyping platforms, such
as the Immunochip (Cortes and Brown 2011; Parkes et al. 2013)
and Metabochip (Voight et al. 2012), containing common and low—
frequency variants have been designed to facilitate the identification
of novel association signals (Beecham et al. 2013; Ellinghaus et al.
2013; Tsoi et al. 2012) and with the goal to fine—map established
loci (Gong et al. 2013; Voight et al. 2012). These platforms contain
dense markers in the top—ranked loci from previous studies (e.g.
studies in autoimmune diseases for Immunochip; studies in meta—
bolic and atherosclerotic/cardiovascular traits/diseases for
Metabochip). Performing functional enrichment analysis on the sig—
nals identified using these customized platforms poses analytical
challenges, as the pre—selected markers are enriched in potential or
known susceptibility loci. The potential to identify the correct
underlying biological mechanisms/pathways can be revealed only if
sufficient gene—sets—overlapping genes from the significant loci are
identified to provide enough statistical power. Moreover, as differ—
ent studies have identified interactions between genes in disease sus—
ceptibility loci (Cotsapas et al. 2011; Rossin et al. 2011), a gene—set
enrichment approach that incorporates independent information
from biological interaction data could thus increase the power to
identify functions or pathways crucial to the disease.

We present here a novel approach, called Minimum distance—
based Enrichment Analysis for Genetic Association(MEAGA), to
perform functional/pathway enrichment test for results from associ—
ation studies. Instead of only enumerating the overlap between genes
in the associated regions and genes annotated in a gene—set
(i.e. count—based; Holmans et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2011), we use
graphical algorithm and incorporates a statistic to measure the
closeness between the overlapping genes in Steiner Tree(s) identified

in a user—defined interaction database. Here we demonstrate in
simulation studies that MEAGA is more powerful than a count—
based approach when protein—coding genes in associated regions
tend to be closer with each other in an interaction network. We also
applied MEAGA to the results of a meta—analysis of psoriasis, a
common inﬂammatory and hyperproliferative skin disease, using
Immunochip datasets (Tsoi et al. 2012). Although the original study
did not identify any enriched biological functions among the identi—
fied loci, MEAGA is able to reveal associated genes are closer with
each other in the protein—protein interaction (PPI) network and are
also significantly enriched in immune—related functions.

2 Methods

2.1 Overview

MEAGA tests the hypothesis that genes from the susceptibility loci
in the trait/disease—associated function/pathway are closer with each
other in the biological interactome than any other genes. The over—
view of MEAGA is illustrated in Fig. 1. MEAGA takes the markers
used in the association analysis as input. Users will pre—specify the

lysis on association results using gene-sets obtained from functional/pathway
databases. For each gene-set being tested, MEAGA identifies overlapping
genes in association signals, and constructs Steiner Tree(s) in the biological
interactome (e.g. PPI database) using Kou's algorithm. Kou's algorithm re-
quires the shortest distances and paths between every gene-pair being com-
puted among the overlapping genes. As illustrated in the bottom right figure,
we could use genes present only in the gene-set (red lines in the bottom-right
figure) or all genes (black lines) to compute shortest paths in the interactome.
MEAGA then constructs Steiner trees and computes statistic Sr. MEAGA

association signals (presumably the most significant marker in each
of the significant loci) and annotate the tagged genes for each
marker (e.g. using linkage disequilibrium blocks or genomic dis—
tance). For each functional gene—set being tested, MEAGA first iden—
tifies the overlapping genes from the signals, then uses graphical
algorithms to construct sub—graph(s) with minimum distance(s) in
the interactome. MEAGA next computes a statistic (ST) summariz—
ing the number of overlapping genes and the overall shortest dis—
tance(s) of the sub—graph(s). MEAGA uses a sampling strategy to
approximate the null distribution of S and compute empirical and
multiple testing—corrected P—values. There is no restriction for the
type of interaction data [e.g. co—expression network (Langfelder and
Horvath 2008); text—mining—derived networks (Franceschini et al.
2013); PPI network (Chatr—Aryamontri et al. 2013)] being used in
MEAGA. Throughout this study, we used PPI data as this provides
the experimentally verified information and it is well—known that
proteins often work together for many biological functions
(Cotsapas et al. 2011).

2.2 Data

We obtained the functional and pathway annotation data from the
GO (Ashburner et al. 2000), KEGG (Kanehisa et al. 2012) and
Reactome (Croft et al. 2013) databases (latest versions downloaded
on May 7, 2013). Since the GO database has a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) layout, in which each term is refined by one or more
less—specific term in the same domain, we processed the GO’s gene—
to—GO file so we also annotated each gene with the ‘ancestral’ terms
of its annotations in the DAG of GO database. Altogether, we ob—
tained over 1.5 million gene to function/pathway connections from
18,987 genes and 19,383 functions/pathways. We downloaded and
examined PPI data from three different sources: BioGrid (Chatr—
Aryamontri et al. 2013), HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al. 2009) and
STRING (Franceschini et al. 2013) (Supplementary Materials).

2.3 MEAGA

2.3.1 Sub-graphs with minimum distances

We first denote G’ as the overlapping genes between a gene—set and
genes in the susceptibility loci (G). By assuming genes involved in
similar biological mechanisms associated with the traits or diseases
would tend to be closer with each other in the interaction network
(see Section 3), we use graphical distance as metric. Specifically,
from the interactome network, we identify Steiner trees (7”) among
genes in G’; each Steiner tree is a connected and undirected acyclic
graph with minimum total length. Note that a Steiner tree would
allow other genes in the interactome to act as intermediate nodes
when there is no direct connections between genes in G’. Therefore,
if G’ contains all the genes in the interactome Steiner tree problem
would become the well—studied minimum spanning tree problem
(Kruskal 1956; Prim 1957). We use the heuristic Kou’s algorithm
(Kou et al. 1981), which has been applied to other biological prob—
lems using Steiner tree technique (Richards et al. 2010; Zheng and
Lu 2007), to identify T’.

2.3.2 Algorithm

MEAGA uses Kou’s algorithm to identify Steiner tree(s) among
genes in G’ in the interactome for each of the function/pathway
being tested. It is possible that not all genes in G’ are connected in
the interactome, so there could be more than one Steiner tree identi—
fied. Also, any gene in G’ not presents in the interactome would be
treated as an isolated Steiner tree. We developed a statistic which

summarizes the number of genes in G’ ()G’ l), the number of identi—
fied Steiner trees ()T’ l ), and the distances for all T’:

ST, : )G/‘zldwmiwi7

lT’l
where m,- is the number of genes from G’ in Steiner tree 1', and w,- is
the weight inversely proportional to the total distance (d,) in tree 1'.
Two Steiner trees could have the same m but different total distances
if there are different numbers of intermediate nodes in the interac—
tome coming from genes not in G’; similarly, two Steiner trees could
have same total distance but contain different m values. Therefore,
the shortest possible distance for a tree with size m could be used as
a reference to normalize d. For Steiner tree with more than one gene,
we set wizoi/di, where o,- is the shortest possible distance for tree
with size mi, and for genes in G’ isolated in the interactome, we set
w,- : 1/Dmax, where Dma,X is a penalty score that equals the most dis—
tant length among all the pairwise shortest paths between genes in
the interactome.

Note that ZiET,m,-/ (T’) in ST is the average number of genes in
G’ among T’, and w,- is a mi—depending weight. If all genes in G’ are
isolated in the interactome, ST! would equal )G’ l/Dmax, which is pro—
portional to (G’). Therefore, count—based functional enrichment ap—
proach is a special case of MEAGA if the interactome does not
provide any information among genes in G’ (see Section 3 from
simulation studies).

Variables such as gene length, linkage disequilibrium structure,
and minor allele frequency of the variant could affect the results of
the functional enrichment test. To compute the empirical P—values
for each gene set effectively, we use a sampling strategy adopted
from previous study (Holmans et al. 2009). Briefly, MEAGA first
randomly samples markers used in the association analysis until the
number of sampled genes equal (G) (user would be able to define the
marker—to—gene region assignment, see below). It then applies the al—
gorithm described above to identify gene—set overlapping genes
among the sampled genes, and computes the S statistic using the
identified Steiner tree(s). MEAGA repeats the sampling procedure N
times to construct null distribution of S, and the empirical P—value is
computed as the proportion of samples in N with statistic S as large
as the ST! of the observed data. Multiple testing is then performed by
sampling from the N samples a random gene set as ‘observed data’,
and then computes its empirical P—values among all tested function/
pathway gene—sets based on comparing its statistic with those ob—
tained from bootstrapping the N samples. This procedure is per—
formed M times, and the multiple testing—corrected p—value is
computed as the proportion of the M samples with minimum empir—
ical p—value (across the function/pathway gene sets) less than or
equal to that from the observed data.

2.3.3 Implementation

We implemented MEAGA in Python, and used the graphical fea—
tures available in the package NetworkX (Hagberg et al. 2008).
Statistical computations were implemented in R (http://www.R—pro—
ject.org). The construction of Steiner trees and the computation of
the statistic S for each sampling step could be time consuming, and
MEAGA supports multiprocessing for these procedures using the
multiprocessing module in Python. The Kou’s algorithm requires the
shortest distances and their paths to be first computed between all
G’. For effective performance, we pre—computed all shortest paths
between genes in each function/pathway gene—set and stored them in
a database to be readily retrieved when performing the Kou’s algo—
rithm. Figure 1 demonstrates that we could use genes present only in

a gene—set (red lines in the bottom—right figure) or all genes (black
lines) to compute shortest paths in the interactome. For the identifi—
cations of Steiner trees and the calculations of statistic S in the ana—
lysis from this study, MEAGA would run linearly with the number
of functions tested (e.g. 200 queried genes and 10 000 random gene—
sets would take around 10 s to complete one function). The compu—
tation of adjusted P—values would take around 6 h to complete when
N and M equal 10 000.

2.4 Simulation and application to association results

To evaluate the performance of MEAGA, and to compare the results
with the count—based approach, we performed simulation to esti—
mate the statistical power evaluated under the same type I error rate
for each approach. We simulated null functions/pathways by select—
ing genes via randomly drawing markers successively from the set of
all markers used in a real study (see below). The true associated
functions/pathways were simulated similarly, except some of the
genes were selected based on sampling the markers from the trait—
susceptibility loci. We simulated shortest distances between the
genes in the interactome, and varied the differences in distances for
genes from the associated loci versus genes that are not. Statistical
power is defined by the proportion of true associated functions iden—
tified to be significant. We used the 112 243 markers from a meta—
analysis for psoriasis (2 Immunochip and 3 GWAS datasets; totally
10 588 psoriasis and 22 806 control samples) in the simulation to
mimic real data (Tsoi et al. 2012).

Finally, we used MEAGA to perform functional/pathway enrich—
ment test for the best single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in
the 39 psoriasis independent loci. We used an interval of :100 kb to
define the tagging genes for each marker (Tsoi et al. 2012). Since func—
tionally related genes could be from the same locus, multiple—counting
this overlap would give rise to false positive results (Holmans et al.
2009; Lee et al. 2011). Therefore, we restricted our analysis to func—
tions/pathways with genes in G’ all coming from different loci.

3 Results

3.1 Simulation results

Figure 2 illustrates the results of the simulation studies under different
approaches (count—based versus MEAGA), simulation settings (i.e.
different numbers of total functions, trait associated functions, and
genes in the functions), and weighting schemes used. We varied the
distances of the Steiner trees identified from genes in association sig—
nals, using those obtained from randomly sampled genes as reference.
As described above, the distance of a Steiner tree is inversely propor—
tional to its weight w; the magnification scale ‘><’ in Figure 2 is the
relative weight set for associated genes referencing the non—associated
genes in the platform. For example, ‘2><’ in Figure 2 represents the
distances for Steiner trees from randomly selected genes in the plat—
form are set to be two times than those for associated genes.

Our results show that when the genes from association signals
are relatively closer with each other in the interactome (i.e. 1.3 X to
4><), MEAGA could obtain higher statistical power in identifying
the true associated functions when comparing with count—based ap—
proach. The gain in statistical power increases when the relative
weight of the Steiner trees increases for the associated genes. If the
interactome does not provide any information (i.e. 1><), the count—
based approach would become a special case for the MEAGA algo—
rithm, and we illustrated in Figure 2 (black and grey lines) that the
count—based approach has identical statistical power with MEAGA
under this situation. We also simulated a ‘counter intuitive’ situation

trait in the simulation study by different approaches under different param-
eter settings. The X—axis represents the number of genes from the association
loci overlapping with the genes in the function (i.e. (6’)). Different lines repre-
sent different relative weights used for associated genes, referencing those
from non-associated genes. We simulated different numbers of total func-
tions, trait-associated functions and genes in the functions for direct compari-
sons (top, middle and bottom panels). We also compared MEAGA to count-
based approach (black). MEAGA uses sampling strategy adopted from
ALIGATOR, so the count-based results equal to the results from ALIGATOR.
Statistical power was evaluated at the significance threshold of paw-20.1
criteria

where the associated genes are further away with each other in the
interactome when comparing with the non—associated genes (0.8x
in Fig. 2). The results show MEAGA only loses a small proportion
of its power (purple in Fig. 2) when compared with the count—based
approach. Section 3.2.1 illustrates that in reality the associated genes
tend to be closer with each other in the interactome.

As expected, an increase in the number of gene—set overlapping
genes (i.e. (G’) in the x—axis of Fig. 2) would increase the statistical
power in the identification of the true functions for all the scenarios
being tested. The results also suggest the total number of genes in
the functions (top and middle panels in Fig. 2) and the number of
functions being tested (top and bottom panels in Fig. 2) both have
effects on the statistical power. For example, when performing en—
richment test for 500 small—sized (~20 genes) functions/pathways
(top panel in Fig. 2), we would gain the maximum power using dif—
ferent approaches if we have 10 overlapping genes from the associ—
ation loci; however, testing for medium—sized (~50 genes) functions/
pathways (middle panel in Fig. 2) would only have less than 20%
statistical power when using the count—based approach or if the
interactome does not provide any information for associated genes,
but we could achieve at least 80% statistical power if the total dis—
tances of Steiner trees from associated genes in the interactome are
at least twofold shorter than those from non—associated genes. We
also tested the performance of MEAGA when the gene interactions
from the network are permuted to different degrees (Supplementary
Fig. S1). While the results illustrate that the statistical power of ac—
curately identifying associated functions/pathways decreases when
the network is permuted to a greater degree, MEAGA would still
perform as well as the count—based approach for a complete random
network. In other words, when the interactome becomes

MEAGA (i.e. it behaves like the 1 X results in Fig. 2).

3.2 Application to meta—analysis results

3.2.1 Gene—gene connections in the interactome

Before performing functional enrichment testing on the meta—ana—
lysis results of psoriasis (Tsoi et al. 2012), we evaluated the connec—
tion for genes identified in the associated loci. We sampled 10 000
random gene—sets from markers used in the meta—analysis, and cal—
culated the proportion (17) of gene pairs that are connected in the
interactome as assessed by BioGrid (Fig. 3 upper panel). We found
that this proportion for genes identified in the psoriasis susceptibility
loci is among the top 5.5% (vertical line) of those from the ran—
domly sampled gene—sets. We then normalized the proportion values
by the total distances of the Steiner trees, and the normalized value
of genes from the association loci is among the top 2.6% of the ran—
domly sampled gene—sets (lower panel vertical line). In concordance
with previous studies (Cotsapas et al. 2011; Rossin et al. 2011) sug—
gesting that proteins encoded by genes in association loci identified
in autoimmune diseases tend to be physically interact (via direct
interaction or 2° of separation), our results show the first time that
using the network topology (in terms of the distances of Steiner
trees) of the interactome could enhance the resolution for identifying
closely interacting genes from the associated loci in an autoimmune
disease. The results further justify the assumption used in MEAGA
of using information from the interactome (PPI in this case) for en—
richment analysis to identify underlying biological functions/path—
ways. Performing the above analyses on PPI obtained from HPRD
and STRING yielded very similar results (Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.2.2 MEAGA highlights immune-related functions/pathways for
psoriasis

To perform enrichment testing on the best signals identified in the
meta—analysis, we restricted our analysis to functions/pathways with
at least 5 and at most 500 genes, and functions/pathways

overlapping with at least two genes from the association signals.
After limiting to the overlapping genes (0) coming only from differ—
ent loci, we tested 743 functions/pathways using MEAGA. We first
evaluated the impact of using different interaction data in the inter—
actome on the results. The empirical P—values computed using only
genes present in functions/pathways (x—axis) versus using all genes
(y—axis) in the interactome are positively correlated (Spearman cor—
relation : 0.88), and using only genes present in the functions/path—
ways tend to give stronger signals in the enrichment analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S3). On further investigation, we realized that
using all genes in the interactome to construct Steiner trees would
tend to be less informative because the human PPI network is sug—
gested to behave like a scale—free network (Barabasi and Oltvai
2004), with hub proteins lessening the average distances from one
protein to the other. Therefore, using all interactions could intro—
duce noise and thus MEAGA would behave like the count—based ap—
proach (spearman correlation : 0.94).

Using the genes present only in functions/pathways to construct
the Steiner trees in the interactome specified by BioGrid, we identified
28 significantly enriched functions/pathways using the pad,- 3 0.1
(pm,W S 2.0 X 1074) criteria. Seven of these were identified as signifi—
cant using ALIGATOR, whereas INRICH identified only one signifi—
cant function (Supplementary Materials and Table S1). The top five
results are shown in Table 1 (results from MEAGA using other PPI
sources are illustrated in Supplementary Table S2). Sensitivity analysis
using different parameters such as minimum/maximum number of
genes allowed in the functions/pathways still yielded similar results.
Immune—related functions such as ‘regulation of leukocyte mediated
cytotoxicity’, ‘positive regulation of lymphocyte differentiation’ and
‘regulation of myeloid cell differentiation’ are significantly enriched
among the genes from the psoriasis susceptibility loci. MEAGA also
successfully reveals those biological functions (e.g. ‘regulation of re—
sponse to biotic stimulus’) which contain three important genes form—
ing protein complexes and involved in the IL—23 signaling pathways
(i.e. IL23A, IL23R, ILIZB) (Nair et al. 2009). Figure 4 demonstrates
the Steiner trees identified in one of the enriched functions. While pre—
vious studies have suggested that TRAF3IP2 is one of the best candi—
date genes in the psoriasis susceptibility locus 6q21 (Ellinghaus et al.
2010), MEAGA shows that FYN from the same locus is annotated in
an enriched immune—related function (Table 1 and Fig. 4), and in
close proximity with genes from other susceptibility loci in the inter—
actome. In fact, a recent study suggests FYN might be involved in the
immunity in psoriasis, and could be a potential drug candidate
(Manczinger and Kemeny 2013). Our results illustrate that MEAGA
not only could identify enriched functions and interactions among
associated loci, but also could prioritize the genes in the loci based on
the functional and interaction data.

We also tested MEAGA for all the psoriasis susceptibility loci
using markers from a GWAS study as background (Nair et al.
2009), and identified 95 significant functions highlighting different
specialized immune—related pathways among the genes in the disease
loci (Supplementary Table S3). We acknowledge that this analysis
could be biased as the markers in the Immunochip datasets tend to
be related to immune mechanisms, but it provides an overview of
the biological functions or pathways that the genes from the psoria—
sis loci involved, when comparing with the enrichment in the whole
genome in general.

We present a novel functional enrichment method called MEAGA in
this study. MEAGA uses graphical algorithm to identify significant

For illustration purpose, we restricted the signiﬁcant results to those functions/pathways with at most 100 genes. Numbers in the bracket represent the number
of genes annotated in the function. Full results shown in the Supplementary Materials. We used PPI obtained from BioGrid in this analysis.

Fig. 4. The networks represent the Steiner trees identified in the enriched
function ‘regulation of response to biotic stimulus'. The edges are the PPI,
and the nodes are the protein-coding genes in the function. Genes in dark
grey colour are from the psoriasis susceptibility loci

biological functions containing genes from susceptibility loci which
have high coherency in the interactome. We showed in the simula—
tion studies that MEAGA outperforms count—based algorithm, and
we also applied MEAGA to the results of a meta—analysis to identify
immune—related functions potentially involved in the pathogenesis
of psoriasis.

Systematic curation and interpretation of biological data are es—
sential for making valid and novel biological inferences (Chatr—
Aryamontri et al. 2013). In this study, MEAGA uses a systems biol—
ogy approach to integrate functional annotations with PPI, and
demonstrates that the genes from susceptibility loci of a complex
disease are closer with each other in the PPI network than randomly
chosen genes.

Extension to other sampling strategies is ﬂexible for MEAGA,
because its implementation distinguishes the Steiner Tree(s) con—
struction from the permutation sampling step. We also demon—
strated in the simulation studies the effectiveness of MEAGA given
the same sampling strategy. Moreover, MEAGA supports pre—
defined markers—to—gene—regions assignment, thus permitting
ﬂexibility for users to use either distance— (ALIGATOR) or linkage
disequilibrium— (INRICH) based intervals when defining gene re—
gions. Using MEAGA, we observed results similar to those shown

above when using linkage disequilibrium—based intervals to define
gene region for each associated marker (results not shown).

We have used graph theory techniques in this study, and we show
that the systems biology approach could facilitate the understanding
of biology for complex disease. Biological systems possess network
properties and often function together, and there have already been
several interesting published studies using network approaches to
model biological units using genome—scale data such as gene expres—
sion or somatic mutation data (Alcaraz et al. 2014; Hofree et al.
2013; Ulitsky et al. 2010; Vandin et al. 2011). We believe advanced
and efficient tools for providing biological inference of genetic data
for complex traits could be based on these methodological founda—
tions, and we have provided Supplementary Table S4 to illustrate
how existing network algorithms which were applied to other gen—
ome—scale data could be useful for future studies of complex traits.

With the recent advancements in the technological and methodo—
logical aspects for using next—generation sequencing to perform
genetic association tests, we envision that MEAGA may prove valu—
able in providing biological inferences for these studies. This is par—
ticularly so for cost—effective targeted sequencing—based studies
(Tang et al. 2013; Zhan et al. 2013) when the investigated regions
are pre—selected to have strong/suggestive association, integrating in—
dependent information would enhance the statistical power in iden—
tifying the underlying biological mechanisms of the trait/disease
being studied.

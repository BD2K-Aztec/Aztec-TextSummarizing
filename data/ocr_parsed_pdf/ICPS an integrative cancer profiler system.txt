ABSTRACT

Founded upon the database of 570 public signatures, ICPS
is a web-based application to obtain biomarker profiles among
11 common cancers by integrating genomic alterations with
transcription signatures on the basis of a previously developed
integrative pipeline. ICPS supports both public data and user’s in-
house data, and performs meta-analysis at a cancer subtype level by
combining heterogeneous datasets. Finally, ICPS returns the robust
gene signature containing potential cancer biomarkers that may be
useful to carcinogenesis study and clinical cancer diagnosis.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA microarrays and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)
have been applied widely to the measurements of gene expression
proﬁles in tumor tissues versus corresponding normal tissues
over the last several years. A large amount of resources of
global quantitative gene expression proﬁles in cancer are now
publicly available, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), Stanford Microarray Database
(SMD, http://genome-www5.stanford.edu) and Cancer Genome
Anatomy Project (CGAP, http://Cgap.nci.nih.gov/). However, any
single high-throughput technology experiment is merely able to
capture a snapshot of gene expression proﬁle in a speciﬁc tumor
sample. Furthermore, each high-throughput technique has its own
limitations. For example, the results of microarray are hardly
reproducible, and the SAGE and EST library techniques are subject
to the sizes and reliabilities of the libraries. Therefore, it is
essential and still Challenging to develop computational integration
analysis tools that can discover the robust gene signature (RGS) by
combining all pieces into a most complete picture of cancer tissues
(Rhodes and Chinnaiyan, 2005).

It has been discovered that many genome alterations, such
as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and Chromosomal gains and
losses, affect mRNA expressions (Spanakis et al., 1999). ICPS

applies a previously developed integrative pipeline to combine
genomic variations with gene expressions, aiming to discover
the RGS in different types or subtypes of cancer (Zhang et al.,
2007).

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND VISUALIZATION

ICPS was implemented by using PERL language (Ver. 5.8.8),
the statistical software R (Ver. 2.10.0) and MySQL database
(Ver. 5.1.30). It was composed of a web interface, a MySQL database
managing public datasets together with gene annotation information
and an integrative analysis system. Gene id and unigene id were used
to cross-link the entries in the selected signatures, and the former
was preferable. All the datasets were collected from GEO, CGAP
and SMD. The experiments were grouped by types and subtypes
of cancer and then analyses were conducted. The SAM method
(Tusher et (11., 2001) and Fisher’s exact test (Beissbarth et al.,
2004) were applied to the mRNA expression microarray datasets
and the SAGE libraries, respectively, with a signiﬁcant threshold of
false discovery rate (FDR) <0.l. The array CGH (aCGH) datasets
were ﬁrst processed by BioHMM segmentation (Marioni et al.,
2006), and then ﬁltered with a threshold of |logRatio| > 0.1. The
current version of ICPS contains 64 datasets, 570 subcancer-type
signatures and 23 375 experiments, and covers 11 major types
of cancers, i.e. lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, bladder
cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer,
pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and stomach cancer. The Cancer
LOH database was constructed by reviewing previous publications
obtained by searching PubMed with key words: (LOH OR ‘loss of
heterozygosity’) AND ‘Cancer’. The LOH database of lung cancer
have been manually reviewed and released in this version, and it
will be released later for the other cancer types. The ICPS database
will be updated quarterly each year.

After applying penalized t-statistics (Efron and Tibshirani, 2002)
to the log ratio values of the parallel experiments in each selected
signature, a weighted voting algorithm and the SAM method were
used to perform the integrative analysis. The detailed pipeline of
genomics variation data processing and the integrative algorithm
were described in our previous article (Zhang et (11., 2007).

In addition to a genome-based heatmap View, ICPS also provided
an integrative visualization for both genomic alterations and gene
expression proﬁles of the RGS results.

3 USING ICPS

ICPS provides a user-friendly interface and detailed, step-by-step
instructions. Users can select one or more interested entries among
1 1 cancer types and ﬁve present dataset types on ICPS homepage. All
the signatures belonging to the selected cancer types and data types
will be shown on the next page. The information, including the data
source, cancer type, cancer subtype and platform, will be displayed
by positioning the mouse pointer over any signature item, which
may help users concentrate on speciﬁc signatures according to the
objects of interest. In addition to the public datasets stored in ICPS
database, users can also input their in-house gene expression data to
expand the integration. SAM method is provided as an alternative
allowing users to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from
the in-house data before integration.

Two integrative analysis parameters, ranking score and FDR, can
be applied to ﬁlter the integration results in ICPS.

After users have conﬁrmed the selected items and started the
analysis, ICPS will refer to the background computation to arrange
the information and return it to a web page containing progress
messages. The whole process may last from 1 min to several hours,
depending on the number and size of present signatures. Users can
retrieve the results on the same page later.

4 DISCUSSION

Our integrative method had been applied to identify RGS genes in
squamous cell lung cancer (SCC). As a result, 109 RGS genes were
obtained and validated by performing lab experiments with reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT—PCR) method as well
as reviewing previous publications (Zhang et al., 2007).

ICPS generates two types of human genome-based visualization,
i.e. a heatmap View and an integrative map. The global proﬁling
provides great convenience for comparing the elements of genomic
alterations with expression signatures. The mean copy number
of all selected aCGH datasets is displayed as a virtual sample
named ‘summaryCGH’ in order to assist users to obtain the
summary statistics of copy number variation and compare it with
the expression proﬁles. The visualization can be constructed in PDF
format and used as a ‘database’ which is convenient for searching
genes of interest. Figure l exempliﬁes the maps at chromosome 3
in SCC, in which DNA ampliﬁcations and up-regulations of gene
expression at 3q (red) and deletions and down-regulations (blue) are
indicated.

As we know, Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org) is a powerful
web-based program processing cancer-speciﬁc data. However, it
performs normalization and presents the processed data for ﬁirther
integration without any easy means of downloading either raw or
processed data. In contrast, ICPS starts from the ‘log ratio value’
which reﬂects the gene expression variations in cancer tissues versus
normal tissues. This strategy avoids cross-platform normalization of
the signal intensity, which is a proverbial difﬁculty and may easily
induce biases, although it is not able to ﬁilly eliminate the batch
effects of such normalization. On the other hand, ICPS will no longer
need login information to access the site. One of the most powerful
features of ICPS is its capacity to cover not only transcriptome
proﬁles but also genomic alterations. Next generation datasets, such
as RNAseq, will be included in future versions of ICPS. In our
opinion, a global integration of such datasets, at various levels, will

ABSTRACT

Summary: NetworkView is an application for the display and analysis
of protein>RNA interaction networks derived from structure and/or
dynamics. These networks typically model individual protein residues
and nucleic acid monomers as nodes and their pairwise contacts as
edges with associated weights. Networkl/iew projects the network
onto the underlying 3D molecular structure so that visualization and
analysis of the network can be coupled to physical and biological
properties. NetworkView is implemented as a plugin to the molecular
visualization software VMD.

Availability and implementation: Networklﬁew is included with VMD,
which is available at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/. Docu-
mentation, tutorials and supporting programs are available at http://
www.scs.i||inois.edu/schulten/software/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The usefulness of 2D contact network Visualization in the
study of protein function has already been demonstrated
(Rahat et al., 2009; Sethi et al., 2009) leading to the development
of software to display these networks (Doncheva et al., 2011).
The NetworkView extension to the Visual molecular dynamics
(VMD) program (Humphrey et al., 1996) was developed to
help structural biologists study allostery and molecular signaling
through network models of protein- RNA complexes in transla-
tion (Black Pyrkosz et al., 2010; Trabuco et al., 2010). Residues
essential for molecular recognition and reaction mechanisms at
different states of the system can be determined by using molecu-
lar dynamics (MD) simulations to calculate variations in con-
tacts and displaying the resulting interaction networks and their
properties directly onto the 3D structure (Alexander et al., 2010).
As networks are increasingly used to study the function and dy-
namics of biological macromolecules, the informative display of
network data directly onto 3D representations of biomolecules is
needed (Bhattacharyya and Vishveshwara, 2011; Csermely et al.,
2010; Daily et al., 2008; Siiel et al., 2002).

2 NETWORK ANALYSIS CONCEPTS

Networks are sets of nodes and edges between pairs of these
nodes. Nodes here are located at specific atoms and represent
amino acids (Ca), nucleobases (N1/N9) or the sugar phosphates
(P) of RNA. Edges are drawn if the average distance observed in
an MD simulation (or contact distance in the X-ray structure) is
less than a pre—deﬁned cutoff. Individual edges may have asso-
ciated weights or lengths based on properties such as correlated
motions (see Fig. 1B), energies or physical distance. A path be-
tween two nodes is simply a set of nodes and edges connecting
one node to the other, and the path length is the sum of weights
for edges in the path. If two nodes lie within a connected network,
there exists at least one optimal, shortest path between them, and
slightly longer paths are referred to as suboptimal (see Fig. 1C).

Major communication pathways are identified by edge
betweenness, the count of all pairwise optimal paths that cross
a given edge (see Fig. 1F). Using the GirvaniNewman (GN)
algorithm (Girvan and Newman, 2002), networks are divided
into disjoint subnetworks called communities in which nodes
have stronger and more connections to other nodes within the
same community than they have to those outside the community.
These communities, which can contain both amino acids and
nucleotides, are similar to structural domains but are defined
by the dynamics of the biomolecules (see Fig. 1E). A more de-
tailed explanation of the network concepts and their associated
algorithms as applied to dynamic networks is available in Sethi
et al. (2009).

Once the physical network of nodes and weighted edges is
generated by the program networkSetup, both optimal and sub-
optimal paths are calculated by subopt, and the edge betweenness
and community structure are determined by gncommunities.
NetworkView simpliﬁes the Viewing of the above network prop-
erties superimposed onto large biomolecular complexes.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

VMD is available for Windows, MacOS X and Linux/UNIX.
NetworkView is implemented as a Tcl plugin to VMD, which
allows direct access to VMD’s powerful atomselection language
and wrapper procedures for the creation and display of OpenGL
objects. A graphical user interface with access to the most com-
monly used features in NetworkView is available through the
VMD menu system: Extensions/Analysis/NetworkView.

Three different types of data files can be loaded into
NetworkView: network, community and suboptimal path. The

data files are ASCII text and were designed to be human read-
able. These ﬁles can be generated by the programs networkSetup,
gncommunities and subopt. NetworkView is not technically tied to
these programs, however, so it can be used to Visualize and ana-
lyze network data generated by other means.

NetworkView provides an application programming interface
(API) for selecting nodes and edges and then Viewing the values
associated with them. Documentation for the NetworkView API
is available on the web at http://www.scs.i11inois.edu/schulten/
software/. A detailed introduction to the use of NetworkView
has been provided in a tutorial with data files hosted at the
same location.

4 USAGE

The necessary data files can be generated from MD trajectories
or from PDB structures. To calculate dynamic networks, a tra-
jectory ﬁle containing selected atoms is processed into a correl-
ation matrix made with the MD analysis program Carma
(Glykos, 2006) through networkSetup. This matrix is then used
to create the local-contact, weighted, adjacency matrix. If no
trajectory data are available, structure networks with unweighted
edges can also be generated from PDB ﬁles. To take full advan-
tage of NetworkView’s capabilities, further processing can be
done on the adjacency matrix to calculate the network’s commu-
nity structure, high-betweenness paths and suboptimal paths be-
tween residues known to participate in molecular signaling.
Aside from Visualization, NetworkView is also intended for
quantitative analysis. Edge weights and other, user-assigned
values associated with nodes and edges can be accessed through
the API. For example, edge weights along a specified optimal

path or at the interface between two molecules can be extracted
for statistical analysis. By projecting network information onto
the atoms within VMD, features related to active sites, molecular
binding interfaces and areas with high sequence or structure con-
servation (Roberts et al., 2006) can be correlated with the calcu-
lated network properties to identify functionally important
residues and structures.

5 CONCLUSION

NetworkView provides high-level, interactive Views of dynamic
and/ or structure networks that enable the analysis and interpret-
ation of molecular signaling. Projection of these networks onto
3D biomolecular structures is useful for rapidly identifying resi-
dues which can be targeted in mutagenesis experiments to test
mechanistic hypotheses.

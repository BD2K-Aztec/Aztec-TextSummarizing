It is of interest to know the importance of various features in error
prediction. There are a total of 266 features based 011 20 PSSM and 18
predicted structural properties and a sliding window size of 7 residues.
However. it is computationally infeasible to examine 266 features indi-
vidually with nearly one million amino acid residues in the training set
for deep neutral networks. Thus. we investigated the performance of
features according to different groups (secondary structure probability
(SS). relative solvent accessibility (RSA). angles (Angles). contact num-

ber and half sphere exposure (HSE). and position specific scoring matrix
(PSSM)). We evaluated the im

ing torsion angles leads to the largest increase in error (3%) but only
minor increases (0.2-0.4%) for other group features. including PSSM.
This is likely due to the fact that all structural properties were predicted
by PSSM. Nevertheless. all features have made statistically significant

ABSTRACT

High-dimensional ‘-omics’ profiling provides a detailed molecular view
of individual cancers; however, understanding the mechanisms by
which tumors evade cellular defenses requires deep knowledge of
the underlying cellular pathways within each cancer sample. We ex-
tended the PARADIGM algorithm (Vaske et al., 2010, Bioinformatics,
26, i237—i245), a pathway analysis method for combining multiple
‘-omics’ data types, to learn the strength and direction of 9139 gene
and protein interactions curated from the literature. Using genomic
and mRNA expression data from 1936 samples in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (T CGA) cohort, we learned interactions that provided
support for and relative strength of 7138 (78%) of the curated links.
Gene set enrichment found that genes involved in the strongest inter-
actions were significantly enriched for transcriptional regulation, apop—
tosis, cell cycle regulation and response to tumor cells. Within the
TCGA breast cancer cohort, we assessed different interaction
strengths between breast cancer subtypes, and found interactions
associated with the MYC pathway and the ER alpha network to be
among the most differential between basal and luminal A subtypes.
PARADIGM with the Naive Bayesian assumption produced gene
activity predictions that, when clustered, found groups of patients
with better separation in survival than both the original version of
PARADIGM and a version without the assumption. We found that
this Naive Bayes assumption was valid for the vast majority of
co-regulators, indicating that most co-regulators act independently
on their shared target.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput genomic technologies have created increasingly
larger sets of data capturing the molecular status of cells, and
these advances have had great impact in the identiﬁcation and
understanding of the cellular mechanisms altered in cancer.
Identiﬁcation of key targets commonly altered within speciﬁc
tumors has enabled the creation of >40 targeted therapies over
the past 20 years; however, the response rate of many of these
drugs is still <50%, which highlights our incomplete understand-
ing of the pathways around these drugs (Park et al., 2008). An
example of such a resistance mechanism is activation of the RAS

pathway in EGFR altered colon cancer tumors, where mutated
KRAS constitutively activates the RAS cascade offering growth
signals independently of the EGFR pathway, rendering EGFR
blocking therapies such as cetuximab ineffective (Karapetis et al.,
2008). By obtaining a more complete understanding of the key
routes through which oncogenic signals travel within the cellular
signaling networks, it should be possible to predict new drug-
gable targets and identify escape routes through which tumors
can evade existing treatments.

Approaches for integrating -omics data at the level of path-
ways have been increasingly popular in the last few years, with
algorithms such as GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), SPIA
(Tarca et al., 2009) and PathOlogist (Efroni et al., 2007) all cap-
able of successfully identifying altered pathways of interest given
pathways curated from literature (V aradan et al., 2012). Another
approach has constructed causal graphs from curated inter-
actions in literature and used these graphs to explain expression
proﬁles (Chindelevitch et al., 2012). Algorithms such as
ARACNE (Margolin et al., 2006), MINDy (Bansal and
Califano, 2012) and CONEXIC (Akavia et al., 2010) take in
gene transcriptional information (and copy-number, in the case
of CONEXIC) to identify likely transcriptional drivers across a
set of cancer samples; however, these approaches do not attempt
to group drivers into functional networks identifying singular
targets of interest (Eifert and Powers, 2012). Some newer path-
way algorithms such as NetBox (Cerami et al., 2010) and Mutual
Exclusivity Modules in Cancer (MEMO) (Ciriello et al., 2012)
attempt to solve the problem of data integration in cancer to
identify networks across multiple data types that are key to the
oncogenic potential of samples. GIENA (Liu et al., 2012) looks
for dysregulated gene interactions within a single biological path-
way but does not take in to account the topology of the pathway
or prior knowledge about the direction or nature of the inter-
actions (Faith et al., 2007). Probabilistic graphical models have
been used extensively in network analysis with landmark uses in
the form of Bayesian Networks (Segal et al., 2003) and Markov
Random Fields (Letovsky and Kasif, 2003). Several methods
have successfully learned interactions from data through many
different means, including relevance networks (Faith et al., 2007).
Our algorithm, PARADIGM (Pathway Recognition Algorithm
using Data Integration on Genomic Models) (V aske et al., 2010),
uses a probabilistic graphical model to integrate multiple gen-
omic data types on curated pathway databases and is unique for
its per-sample approach that allows individual samples to be
assessed alone or within the context of a cohort of interest.

Learning interactions with PARADIGM

 

Learning sensible parameters for gene interactions is essential
for PARADIGM to infer activities within each sample. In the
original implementation of PARADIGM, expectationimaxi-
mization (EM) parameter learning was only performed by de-
fault on observational data parameters, as the limited size of
available datasets prevented robust estimation of interaction par-
ameters. When using a standard conditional probability table
with discrete variables, the size of the table, and therefore the
number of parameters, grows exponentially with the number of
regulators, presenting additional challenges to efﬁcient estima-
tion of interaction parameters. However, by assuming a condi-
tional independence of the regulators, we can replace the
conditional probability table with a product of independent regu-
latory factors, and the number of parameters grows linearly with
the number of regulators.

Examination of statistics related to regulatory links, rather than
individual gene activities, is a view related (but not directly corre-
lated) to that which is normally examined in high-throughput
studies. By identifying regulatory links that have signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent usage distributions within a phenotype of interest in the co-
hort, we can begin to examine how different regulators within a
network might produce similar cellular phenotypes despite using
entirely different pathways to accomplish them. Additionally,
these learned parameters can then be used as the basis for statis-
tical tests to establish how well individual samples or subsets of the
cohort follow the distribution of learned parameter patterns for
each regulatory node. This article describes in detail this new ap-
proach and shows the overall improvement and additional ana-
lysis capabilities when applied across the TCGA data.

2 METHODS

PARADIGM represents the states of biological moleculesgeg. proteins,
mRNAs, complexes and small biomoleculesifrom a tumor sample as
variables in a probabilistic graphical model. For every gene, we use vari-
ables for the genome copy number, mRNA and protein, and additionally
a non-physical variable that corresponds to biological activity of a gene,
as annotated in a pathway, and which may be regulated by posttransla-
tional modiﬁcation of the protein. Additionally, there are variables that
represent more abstract states, such as apoptosis, that are commonly
annotated in pathways.

Causal interactions that change the state of moleculesieg. gene tran-
scriptional regulation, protein phosphorylation and complex formationi
are represented as directed edges from the regulating variable to the
regulated variable. For each variable Y in the probabilistic graph, we
introduce a factor into the joint probability model relating the state of
the variable to the state of all its regulators: F( Y|X1, X2, . . . , X N), where
X1 through X N are the variables that regulate Y. This factor is a
conditional probability table: for each setting of Parents(Y),
Z},EYF(Y = y|Parents( Y)) = 1. Observations of individual variables,
such as the genome copy number or gene expression, are modeled as
separate variables, connected to the latent variable by a factor F( YlX),
also a conditional probability table. The full joint probability state
is then:

1
P Q = — F YParents 1
( ) Z  ( | m) ( )
where Z is a normalization constant required due to regulatory cycles in
the pathway.

Given observations for a sample, we solve for marginal distribution

of each unobserved variable, using the loopy belief propagation

implementation in libDAI (Mooij, 2010) with inference performed in
the probability space (as opposed to log space), a convergence tolerance
of 10’9 and with the SEQFIX update schedule. The parameters for all F
functions are learned via expectation maximization in libDAI, stopping
when the ratio of successive log-likelihoods is <10’10.

In this work, we have introduced new variables into each gene’s central
dogma that correspond to the transcriptional, translational and protein
regulation states of each gene, as shown in Figure 1A. This central dogma
means that each protein-coding gene will have identical central dogma
structure, and therefore we are able to share parameters between all
genes. The unique regulatory program is then modeled only in the tran-
scription, translation and protein regulation variables for each gene.

Regulation models: We extended PARADIGM by altering how regu-
lation nodes are handled by the algorithm. To construct a factor graph
and allow for comparison between many types of data, PARADIGM
discretizes the input data to down, up or normal relative to some control.
Regulation nodes collect activity signals of all of the genes involved in
regulation of a given gene at some point along the path from DNA to
active protein. These signals are collected in a single variable which con-
nects to a gene’s central dogma structure through a factor. Under the
original model, regulation nodes would simply take a vote of incoming
signals to decide if an activation or inhibition signal was passed along. In
this new version, we learn the likelihood of each setting of the child
variable Y being passed given the setting of the parent nodes
X1, . . . , X N. In this article, we contrast both the co-dependent and inde-
pendent regulation models shown in Figure 1B. With the co-dependent
regulation model, this probability is stored directly as a parameter in a
conditional probability table for all possible settings of the parents and
child. In contrast, with the independent regulation model, we use P(Y)
and P(Xil Y) as parameters and simply calculate the product of the par-
ameters to ﬁnd this probability:

P(YIXI. ....XN)=%P(Y)1‘_[P(X,-m (2)

where Z is a normalizing constant that corresponds to P(X1 , . . . , X N). To
initialize the parameters for the independent regulation model, we give

P(Y) an equal probability of down, up or normal, and we set the initial
probability for P(Xil Y) based on the annotation of the link in the
pathway. For links labeled as activators P(downldown) =
P(normallnormal) = P(uplup) = 0.8 and for inhibitors P(downlup) =
P(normallnormal) = P(upldown) = 0.8 with all the probabilities of all
other settings set to 0.1. We also performed tests using a uniform distri-
bution across all settings to test the importance of using this prior know-
ledge from the pathway.

We use the same simple voting procedure that was originally used
in PARADIGM as the initial parameters for EM learning in the
co-dependent regulation model. We use 6 = 0.001 so 99.9% of the prob-
ability is placed in the child state that wins the vote and 0.05% is placed in
the other states as the initial likelihoods.

An additional minor change to the original PARADIGM algorithm is
that we now allow ‘activation’ regulation of complexes and gene families
between the protein and active states. Speciﬁcally, each family and com-
plex is now modeled by a trio of variables: family/complex, regulation
and active, connected with a single factor F(active|regulation,
family/complex). Regulators of the family or complex are connected to
the active variable, with either the co-dependent or independent regula-
tion model. Components of the family or complex are connected to the
family/complex variable, using either a noisy-min or noisy-max factor,
with e = 0.001. Only the noisy-min or noisy-max factor was used in ear-
lier iterations of PARADIGM.

Regulation statistics: We use G-tests to determine the signiﬁcance of
the dependence between parents and children of regulatory links (3) as
well as the signiﬁcance of the conditional dependence between parents
given a child distribution (4):

 

GM = 2 X: 01,111?
U 1,1 PM Y) (3)
= 2N P Xi, Y- 1 
 ( ’) “ P(Xm Y1)
GM = 2N2) P(Xt. th Y)  (4)

1,1
The G-test follows the X2 distribution, so we can ﬁnd P-values using X2
distributions with 4 and 12 degrees of freedom for the parentwhild test
and the parentiparent test, respectively. P-values are adjusted for false
discovery rate (FDR) and links with adjusted P<0.05 are considered
signiﬁcant.

Although the G-test (which is proportional to the mutual information)
tells us how strong an interaction is, it doesn’t give us details about the
sign of the interaction (i.e. activation is a positive interaction and inhib-
ition is a negative interaction). To get these details, we calculated both the
Pearson correlation between the parent and child, and the weighted
pointwise mutual information, or WPMI (5) (Raina et al., 2006) at all
possible settings of parent and child. Correlation was calculated using the
joint distribution P(Xi, Y) = P(XilY)P(Y), and signiﬁcance was calcu-
lated using the Fisher transformation. Correlation between two parents
given the child was also calculated to determine if the three nodes formed
a coherent or incoherent feed forward loop.

To compare G-test results between groups, we took the differences of
the ranks of the G statistic in each group. The signiﬁcance of this statistic
was calculated by performing a permutation test with 5000 random
permutations of the group membership and then adjusting for FDR.
For differences greater than any of those observed in the permutations,
the lowest possible P-value was used as an upper bound.

WPMI“. = poo, Y.) 111m

The WPMI is simply each individual element of the G-score sum. We
arrange the vector of 9 WPMI values as an easy to interpret heat map.

Ovarian clustering: We used the HOPACH clustering algorithm
from Bioconductor (van der Laan and Pollard, 2003; Pollard et al.,
2012), which attempts to ﬁnd the number of clusters that best ﬁts the
data. This results in different numbers of clusters for each set of IPLs
clustered, so to ﬁnd clusterings with a consistent number of clusters be-
tween all datasets, we collapsed the smallest clusters by reassigning small
cluster members to the closest large cluster. We collapsed small clusters in
this manner to get a consistent number of clusters across all of our
clusterings. This method also served to keep cluster sizes consistent
across our comparisons.

2.1 Genomic and pathway data

Genomic and pathway data (Matthews et al., 2009; Schaefer et al., 2009)
detailed in Supplement 1.

Set enrichment: We used DAVID (Huang et al., 2008; Sherman et al.,
2009) to perform gene set enrichment on the genes involved in inter-
actions learned by PARADIGM. To maximize number of genes recog-
nized by DAVID, we split gene complexes and families into their
component genes. Enrichment for genes involved in links was compared
to a background of all of the genes in our curated pathway.

Intermediate nodes: A full conditional probability table with N par-
ents will store probabilities for all 3N4r1 possible settings of parents and
children. Some central genes in our curated pathway have >30 regulators,
so to prevent the size of these tables from becoming prohibitive, we
limited the number of parent nodes that could be attached to a child
node to 5. For genes regulated by more than ﬁve proteins, we added
intermediate nodes to the graph to maintain this limit. E.g. a gene with
10 regulators would have two intermediate nodes with five regulators
attached to each intermediate node.

Coxnet feature selection: The TCGA cohort was ﬁrst subset down
to the 364 breast cancer samples labeled as ER+ in the associated clinical
data. Survival censoring was determined by the Vital Status label and if a
patient was not alive the Days to Death data was used, otherwise Days to
last known alive (if present) or Days to last follow-up were used. Both
IPLs and sample-specific link g-scores were ﬁltered to the top 5% of
features by variance, and features were then z-score transformed to
normalize variance between the two types of values. The selection was
performed by using the cox method in the glmnet package (Friedman
et al., 2010; Simon et al., 2011) version 1.9-1 in R version 2.15.2 with a
maximum iteration of 100 000 which completed without warnings.

3 RESULTS

We learned regulatory interactions on a dataset of 1936 TCGA
tumor samples with gene expression and copy number data, from
11 tissue types. We then assessed interaction signiﬁcance by a
G-test and interaction sign with a correlation value. Of the 9139
interactions in the pathway model that regulate a protein, 7631
(83.5%) were found to be signiﬁcant at an FDR of 0.05. A prin-
cipal component analysis (PCA) of the WPMI vectors for each
interaction learned across the entire TCGA cohort (Fig. 2)
reveals a gradient from strong inhibition to strong activation.
K-means clustering of the WPMI vectors found clusters along
this gradient representing canonical interaction types ranging
from strong activation to strong inhibition. Of 7631 significant
links, 78 (1%) were placed in a cluster where the centroid was

(C) Heatmaps of the WPMI values of the centroids of the clusters show a range from strong inhibition (1) to strong activation (5)

going the opposite direction of how the link was annotated in the
pathway. The variety of WPMI vectors shows that EM was able
to learn new interaction regimes that resemble activators and
inhibitors as well more complex regulatory patterns.

Using correlation measure (see Section 2), we assessed each
interaction as activation or inhibition and compared with the
interaction type annotated in the pathway model. There were
7357 links with both signiﬁcant correlation and g-scores and of
those the correlation of 219 links (3%) did not agree with the
direction of regulation in the pathway. This leaves 7138 (78%)
links that are signiﬁcant by both tests and agree with the curated
links. We also found that that some links had high correlation
values but low signiﬁcance from our g-tests; this usually hap-
pened in cases where either the parent or child distribution
greatly favored a single state.

We compared these results to what could be found by a
straightforward Pearson correlation of gene expression profiles.
Because we can not look at expression profiles for families and
complexes, we tried two different approaches for this compari-
son. First, we compared our results to the expression correlation
of links not involving complexes or families. Of the links learned
by Paradigm, 1197 had signiﬁcant correlation and g-scores and
did not include complexes or families. For 51 of these links
(4.3%), the sign of correlation coefﬁcient disagrees with the lit-
erature. On the other hand, looking only at gene expression pro-
ﬁles, we found 1058 non-complex non-family links with

signiﬁcant correlation, but 470 (44%) disagreed with the sign
of the pathway entry. For our second comparison, we eliminated
complexes and families in our pathway by connecting all genes
that were components of families and complexes directly to any
gene regulated by those families and complexes. This ﬂattening
procedure resulted in 200 921 links. We found that 165 258 of
these links had significantly correlated gene expression proﬁles,
and that 81558 of the links (49.4%) had correlation that dis-
agreed with the direction of the link in the pathway. These results
indicate that the links learned by paradigm are much more in
agreement with the direction of the links in literature than the
correlation of gene expression proﬁles is.

Running the PCA and clustering analysis on only WPMI
scores learned from TCGA Ovarian (OV) patients (N:416)
and without complex and family activation regulation produced
very similar results to the PCA and cluster centers shown in
Figures 2A and C, but found fewer signiﬁcant links and a
higher proportion of links that were annotated as activators,
and learned as inhibitors or vice versa (Fig. 3A). When we
used a ﬂat initialization of P(X,-| Y) = 1/3 (Fig. 3B), we found
that the cluster centers again mapped to a gradient from activa-
tion to inhibition, and there were fewer significant links and
a higher proportion of link direction disagreements than with
initial settings that include direction information.

We expected the reduction in signiﬁcant links between the
entire TCGA cohort and just OV samples because datasets

with a larger number of samples have more evidence to support
even subtle interaction trends. The increase in proportion of links
in clusters that do not agree with their annotation could be ex-
plained by the difference in sample number because any outliers
would have less effect on probabilities calculated across the entire
dataset. In this setting, however, these changes of link signiﬁ-
cance or direction are of interest because the TCGA cohort con-
tains many different diseases and tissue types. The pathway does
not include details about the tissue or disease in which a given
interaction was observed in the literature, so it is possible that in
a different tissue or disease state and interaction direction could
change either through mutation or some other mechanism. These
direction changes are worth studying because they may give us
some insight into the mechanism of the disease. Our tests with
ﬂat initialization show that even without starting the link par-
ameters in linear activation/inhibition states, a gradient across
these linear relationships can be learned. Many of the links that
lose signiﬁcance come from the middle cluster, which has little
positive or negative correlation, but we also lose most of the links
from the clusters with the strongest activation and inhibition
signals. This suggests that by not using prior knowledge about
link type, we lost some of our strongest interactions that could
have been biologically relevant and could also reduce the quality
of our final protein activity predictions.

To test the Naive Bayes independence assumption presented in
Figure l, we ran PARADIGM with both the independent and co-
dependent regulation models on the TCGA ovarian cancer sam-
ples. We tested the conditional independence assumption on the
expectations calculated at each EM step of the PARADIGM run
(Fig. 4A). At every step of training, fewer co-regulators were
found to be dependent upon each other. Because of small feed-
back loops in the pathway, such as a transcription factor that
regulates its own transcription, we expect that the independence
assumption will fail in some cases. Additionally, it is quite
common for two very similar complexes, differing by only one
molecule, to co-regulate the same child node, in which case we
also expect the conditional independence test to fail, despite there
being little conﬂict. Consequently, we divide the cases where two
co-regulators fail the independence test into ‘coherent’ and

ation (inhibition). The interactions between parents are not found in the
literature, so we use double sided arrows because we can not know the
direction of that interaction

‘incoherent’ classes, as shown in Figure 4B. Additionally, two
co-regulators may fail the independence test even if one of the
co-regulators is an insignificant regulator, owing to the strength of
the other regulator. We therefore also consider the subset of cases
where both co-regulators are significant on their own. Our tests
show that the initial parameters produced by the weighted vote
method cause almost 50% of child nodes to fail the conditional
independence test, but as the EM algorithm learns more likely par-
ameter settings, fewer and fewer nodes fail the test. Combining all
of our tests shows that only ~5% of child nodes are likely to have
codependent regulators in a meaningful way.

Using the ovarian cancer samples, we clustered the protein
activity predictions produced by the original PARADIGM and
those from both the co-dependent and independent regulation
models. We then performed KaplaniMeier analysis on these
clusters to see whether they had signiﬁcantly differential survival
proﬁles (Fig. 5). We found that the clusters produced using in-
dependent regulation model activity predictions were the most
separable by their survival (log-rank P=2.0 x 10‘“). We also
performed this test using the independent regulation model with
a ﬂat initial setting for the P(X,-| Y) parameters and found that it
performed worse than the original PARADIGM model. Again,
this indicates that our learning method requires prior knowledge
about the type of interaction that is lost when using a ﬂat initial
interaction setting.

Figure 6 shows tissue-differential link usage in the most
significant by coloring each interaction by its correlation score

Fig. 6. Heatmap of the g-score ranks colored by link correlation, with red
tending towards activating and blue tending towards inhibiting. For visu-
alization purposes, interactions were ﬁltered if they had a standard devi-
ation <0.2 across all samples or did not have at least one tissue with a
score of 30.7, resulting in 211 interactions out of the original 10307

in a tissue and setting its saturation proportional to its signiﬁ-
cance. The strongest differential g-scores were seen for links
regulated by key cancer genes and complexes, including TP53,
MYC/MAX, HIFlA/ARNT, TAp73a, E2F1 and PPARA-
RXRA. Of particular interest are the links regulated by

PPARA-RXRA primarily different within GBM [brain and
KIRC (kidney)] and the TAp73a regulatory links in OV (ovar-
ian) and to a lesser degree in UCEC (uterine endometrioid).
Figure 7 shows a plot of the WPMI signals grouped by tissue
for the activating links from PPARA-RXRA and TAp73a,
where signiﬁcantly increased weights are found on the activating
diagonal, indicating increased use of these links as activators
in those tissues. The signature of TAp73 activity potentially
indicates a female reproductive or hormonal pattern of patho-
genesis associated with p73 expression. TAp73 promotes the
expression of cell cycle inhibitors and inducers of apoptosis,
one of which is the tumor suppressor BAX, which acts as an
inhibitor of the activity of the oncogene BCL2. BCL2 is known
to be highly expressed in serous ovarian cancer, and our results
here show that although TAp73 is highly expressed and is a
strong promoter of BAX expression (and thus BCL2 inhibition),
it is nonetheless ineffective in retarding tumorigenesis, suggesting
that small molecule inhibition of BCL2 may be equally ineffect-
ive. Not surprisingly, single-agent treatments of ovarian cancer
with small molecule inhibitors of BCL2, despite high BCL2 ex-
pression in serous ovarian cancer, have not succeeded to date
(Simonin et al., 2013), suggesting a downstream blockade or
attenuation of TAp73-mediated activity in this type of cancer.
It is important to note that almost all of the serous ovarian
samples here bore mutations in p53, perhaps suggestive of an
upstream shunting of tumorigenesis as well that perhaps over-
comes TAp73 over-expression or increased activity. Other
groups have additionally shown the importance of PPARA-
RXRA activity in both GBM and KIRC and their sensitivity
to fenoﬁbrate, a PPARA agonist (Giordano and Macaluso,
2012; Ganti et al., 2012). The tissue-speciﬁc signals identiﬁed
through this analysis appear to reiterate recent biological discov-
eries that appear to be unique when examined in the context of
the current TCGA dataset.

The most signiﬁcant links learned across the entire TCGA
cohort (Table l) are a number of known cancer genes including
the forkhead box transcription factor Al, p53 and estrogen re-
ceptor alpha. To perform a gene set enrichment with DAVID

in the 50 interactions with the highest G-scores, we replaced
families and complexes with their component genes. This pro-
duced 112 unique genes that were recognized by DAVID from
the top 50 links. These genes were significantly enriched (P<1e-
7) for a number of relevant KEGG terms including ‘pathways in
cancer’, ‘apoptosis’, ‘Jak-STAT signaling pathway’ and ‘MAPK
signaling pathway’ as well as a number of different cancer type-
speciﬁc terms. We compared this result with what could be found
by only looking at gene expression correlation of the genes that
are linked in our pathway. We needed to take the top 200 gene
expression pairs by Pearson correlation from the ﬂattened path-
way to get a set of unique genes of comparable size (N: 119) to
the set produced by Paradigm. Although both gene sets

produced similar enrichments for Gene Ontology terms for bio-
logical processes (GOTERM_BP_FAT), we found far fewer
KEGG terms by using gene expression correlation than by
using our learned links (20 versus 46 at FDR<0.05) and the
FDR. The KEGG terms that overlapped between the two sets
had a lower FDR in the PARADIGM set. To ensure that the
ﬂattening of families and complexes in the pathway was not
biasing these results, we repeated this analysis for non-family,
non-complex links in the pathway only and found similar results
(20 KEGG terms found for Paradigm links versus 3 for expres-
sion correlation at FDR<0.05).

We compared the strength of links between subtypes of breast
cancer to get some insight into the regulatory differences between
the subtypes (Table 2). This comparison as well as other com-
parisons between tissues never found links that completely
switched direction from activation to inhibition. Instead, we
often observed that links turned off or on (e. g. changed from a
strong activator to neutral). Because direction rarely changes, we
found it informative to simply look at the differences between the
G-score signiﬁcance of links. We used the rank difference of the
G-scores to allow us to compare between groups so as to adjust
for the G-score’s dependence on sample size. Many of the links
with the highest rank differences had the same parents, so
Table 2 shows the links with the highest rank difference on a
per parent basis and include the full table as Supplement 2. In 9
of the top 10 links that were stronger in Basal tumors, HIFlA
was the parent, and the top four links stronger in Luminal A
tumors had CEBPB as a parent.

To identify clinically relevant activities and link strengths, we
examined the estrogen receptor-postiive (ER+) breast cancer pa-
tients. We performed a regularized Cox regression of TCGA
survival data on both link g-scores and IPLs to identify the op-
timal number of features to best split the cohort. At the min-
imum lambda, the coxnet model contained nine features that
best split the ER+breast cancer patients (Table 3). Four of

the nine features were link g-scores, which illustrates the inde-
pendent utility of these scores as potential prognostic markers.
Additional work is needed to validate this model in an independ-
ent dataset before it can be considered a true prognostic signa-
ture in ER+ patients.

CEBPB and HIF1A/ARNT appeared in both Tables 2 and 3.
CEBPB is a transcription factor that has been associated with
tumor progression, poor prognosis and ER negative status
(Milde—Langosch et al., 2003). Furthermore, over expression of
HSP90B1, a heat shock protein regulated by CEBPB and found
in Table 2, has been associated with distant metastases and
decreased overall survival in breast cancer patients with other-
wise good prognoses (Cawthorn et al., 2012). HSP90B1 has
undergone clinical trials as an immunotherapy for melanoma
under the name vitespen (Testori et al., 2008). HIFlA/ARNT
overexpression is clinically relevant in ER— and PR— breast
cancer, where splice variants have been associated with reduced
metastasis-free survival (Dales et al., 2010). Because Basal
tumors are generally ER—, and Luminal A tumors are generally
ER+, the differential link strength could be due to increased
occurrence of the splice variant in the Basal tumors. The top

two links by G-score rank difference between Basal and
Luminal are HIFlA/ARNT activating HKl and HK2 (hexoki-
nases), HK2 is involved in glucose metabolism and apoptosis,
and has been associated with brain metastases from breast can-
cers as well as poor survival post craniotomy (Palmieri et al.,
2009). These ﬁndings indicate that we are able to ﬁnd links
that are relevant both by contrasting between tumor subtypes
and by searching for links within a subtype that are predictive of
a clinical variable.

4 DISCUSSION

We have shown that by extending PARADIGM, we can com-
bine multiple -omics data to learn the strength and sign of regu-
latory interactions curated from the literature. The assumption
of conditional independence enables a reduction in model com-
plexity allows efﬁcient estimation of regulatory parameters using
existing datasets, and further, and we show that the independ-
ence assumption is valid for the vast majority of regulatory pro-
grams. In addition, where the independence assumption does not
hold, future extensions would be able to replace the independent
factors with more complex factors that properly model a co-de-
pendent regulatory program. When these learned parameters are
applied, biological insight can be gained from simply looking at
the strongest links across a cohort of samples or by looking at
how interactions change between phenotypes of interest. This
regulatory learning improved PARADIGM’s overall protein ac-
tivity predictions, resulting in better separation of survival across
clusters of ovarian cancer patients.

We ﬁnd that though cancer subtypes use different interactions,
an interaction generally has a consistent sign whenever it is used
in a particular tumor. This indicates that our current level of
knowledge of cofactors as able to account for the cases where
a gene switches the direction of activity. Further, the concord-
ance of our learned interaction sign and the interaction sign in
databases, despite the various ways that interaction sign is anno-
tated in the BioPAX language across pathway databases, indi-
cates that pathway databases have successfully and faithfully
cataloged of thousands of wetlab experiments in the literature.

The independence of co—regulators provides computational
beneﬁts for model inference and parameter learning, and also
aids in model interpretation. The factorability of regulation
models corresponds to log-linearity. However, a great number
of regulators in the model are complexes, and the complex
formation factor is a non-linear noisy-MAX function. Thus,
regulation nonlinearity can still be encoded in the factor graph
by representing physical complexes. This lends plausibility to a
physical interpretation of most regulation links in the pathway:
competitive binding of independent regulators should combine
linearly, as long as the truly independent physical entities have
been captured as complexes. If this physical interpretation
is true, then there should be a correspondence between relative
strengths of measured physical binding constants and
PARADIGM interaction scores. In cases where the independ-
ence assumption does not hold, it is likely that there is a latent
co-factor, which could be modeled by replacing P(YlX1)P(YlX2)
with a factor such as P(Yle, X2).

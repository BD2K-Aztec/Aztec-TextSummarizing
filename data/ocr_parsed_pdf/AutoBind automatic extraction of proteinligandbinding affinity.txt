ABSTRACT

Motivation: Determination of the binding affinity of a protein—
ligand complex is important to quantitatively specify whether a
particular small molecule will bind to the target protein. Besides,
collection of comprehensive datasets for protein—ligand complexes
and their corresponding binding affinities is crucial in developing
accurate scoring functions for the prediction of the binding affinities
of previously unknown protein—ligand complexes. In the past
decades, several databases of protein—ligand-binding affinities have
been created via visual extraction from literature. However, such
approaches are time-consuming and most of these databases are
updated only a few times per year. Hence, there is an immediate
demand for an automatic extraction method with high precision for
binding affinity collection.

Result: We have created a new database of protein—ligand-binding
affinity data, AutoBind, based on automatic information retrieval. We
first compiled a collection of 1586 articles where the binding affinities
have been marked manually. Based on this annotated collection,
we designed four sentence patterns that are used to scan full-text
articles as well as a scoring function to rank the sentences that match
our patterns. The proposed sentence patterns can effectively identify
the binding affinities in full-text articles. Our assessment shows
that AutoBind achieved 84.22% precision and 79.07% recall on the
testing corpus. Currently, 13616 protein—ligand complexes and the
corresponding binding affinities have been deposited in AutoBind
from 17221 articles.

Availability: AutoBind is automatically updated on a monthly basis,
and it is freely available at http://autobind.csie.ncku.edu.tw/ and
http://autobind.mc.ntu.edu.tw/. All of the deposited binding affinities
have been refined and approved manually before being released.

1 INTRODUCTION

Determination of the binding afﬁnity is essential for quantifying the
protein interactions with other bio-molecules. For example, actually
estimating the protein—DNA-binding afﬁnity is an important step

in understanding the regulation mechanisms of cells (Chen et (11.,
2012; Chien et (11., 2012; Morozov and Siggia, 2007). In the ﬁeld of
drug design, the binding afﬁnity of a ligand to a given protein target
is used to judge whether this ligand can be considered as a potential
drug candidate.

Several databases of protein—ligand-binding afﬁnities have been
proposed, including Ligand-Protein Database (LPDB) (Roche et (11.,
2001), Protein Ligand Database (PLD) (Puvanendrampillai and
Mitchell, 2003), PDBbind (Wang et (11., 2004), Binding MOAD (Hu
et (11., 2005), AfﬁnDB (Block et (11., 2006) and BindingDB (Chen
et (11., 2002; Liu et (11., 2007). These databases depend on structure
databases (Berman et (11., 2000; Chang et (11., 2012) and require
much time and cost for the manual inspection of the literature.
Until September 2011, more than 21 million articles indexed contain
the descriptions of binding afﬁnity in the MEDLINE database.
The time-consuming manual extraction cannot timely accommodate
the astonishingly increasing number of ﬁill-text articles. Therefore,
there is an immediate demand for automatic extraction of protein—
ligand-binding afﬁnities.

Information Retrieval (IR) is a computational technique aiming
at extracting information from the literature without manual
intervention (Krallinger and Valencia, 2005). Summarization is a
widely seen IR application in various areas, which can automatically
compile extractive summaries that include the important aspects
of ﬁill-text articles (Bhattacharya et (11., 2011). In the biomedical
ﬁeld, this technique is used to generate gene annotations (Chiang
et (11., 2006) and to search bio-images (Agarwal and Yu, 2011).
In recent years, IR has been used to extract biological entities
of interest and their relationships (Rindﬂesch et (11., 2000). For
example, ‘activate’ and ‘interact’ are two common relation terms
that connect molecule entities. This technique has been applied
to protein—protein interactions (Blaschke et (11., 1999; Koike and
Takagi , 2005; Zhou and He, 2008), pathway networks (McDonald
et (11., 2004) and drug interactions (Tari et (11., 2010).

However, so far there have been only a few studies that attempted
to extract biological values or parameters. For example, Spasié et (11 .
used terminology concept to index and select literature, then a score
function was implemented to rank the retrieved articles by relevance
of parameters for kinetic modeling of yeast metabolic pathways
(Spasié et (11., 2009); Heinen et (11. used a rule-based approach to
collect kinetic information of enzymes (Heinen et (11., 2010). In
general, the experimental procedures or results described in full-
text articles are hard for researchers to re-use (Neveol et (11., 2011).
The fact that comparisons with events, values and parameters are
usually recorded in a more ﬂexible way in the literature makes the

development of value extraction approaches more difﬁcult (Milo
et (11., 2010).

In this article we describe the construction of AutoBind, an
automatic information extraction system dedicated to protein—
ligand-binding afﬁnity. Our system includes four patterns to identify
candidate sentences describing protein—ligand-binding afﬁnity and
a scoring function to rank the identiﬁed sentences for extracting
binding afﬁnities. We applied AutoBind on the primary Citations of
all entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Many primary Citations
contain multiple afﬁnities corresponding to different experimental
conditions, such as wild-type and mutated proteins, but only one
represents the actual binding afﬁnity of the crystal structure. In this
study, we focused on the afﬁnity corresponding to the structure in
each primary Citation since 1996, whose ﬁill-text references can
be easily retrieved. Finally, the extracted protein—ligand-binding
afﬁnities and the corresponding complex structures were organized
as a public database named AutoBind. Note that AutoBind in
this article refers both the extraction algorithm and the database.
The extraction algorithm is completely automatic. However, the
binding afﬁnities deposited in the database have been approved
manually, in order to reﬁne them and eliminate possible errors and
inconsistencies. On the other hand, all the reported performances
(in Tables 3—6 and Sections 4.1 and 4.2) were evaluated on the
results obtained before the manual approval. In short, this article
presents an automatic extraction algorithm to expedite constructing
and maintaining a database, but the database construction was not
fully automatic.

The AutoBind database currently contains 13 616 protein—ligand
complexes. To our knowledge, this is the largest collection of
protein-binding afﬁnities. The database will be updated regularly.

2 BINDING AFFINITY RECORD

In this section, we describe the deﬁnition of a binding afﬁnity record
in this study, which frames the data that AutoBind extracted. The
binding afﬁnity is a measure of the effectiveness of a compound in
connecting other molecules. It is thermodynamically quantiﬁed as
dissociation constant (Kd), inhibition constant (Ki) or half maximal
(50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50). The detailed deﬁnitions of
these measures can be found in the Supplementary Data.

We carried out an analysis on a set of ﬁill-text articles
collected from the PDBbind database (Wang et (11., 2004), denoted
PDBbind_c0rpus, where the actual binding afﬁnities as well as the
associated protein—ligand complexes were known. In this corpus,
we observed that a description of a binding afﬁnity has four major
objects:

<PROTEIN>: ﬁinctional polypeptides or macromolecules.

0 <LIGAND>: the meta-ions and small organic/inorganic ions
and organic solvent molecular.

0 <EVENT>: the interaction/relation between the protein and
ligand.

0 <VALUE>: binding afﬁnity.

Example 1 shows an example of describing protein-binding
interaction and their binding afﬁnity, where all the four objects
(italicized) appeared in the same sentence.

 

Example 1 The lack of electron density for the adenosine moiety of
the TP4A<LIGAND> molecule bound to<EVENT>
hTK1<PROTEIN> is surprising, taking into account the
very high afﬁnity of the bisubstrate analog for hTKI , with

a Kd 0f29 nM<VALUE>. (PMID: 17407781)

 

However, authors frequently use variable writing styles to make
the articles ﬂuent. Example 2 shows a description of protein—ligand
binding without precisely describing the <LIGAND>.

 

Example 2 For the wild-type PARN-RRM <PROTEIN>, a Kd value of
6.94 :I:2.08 i1M<VALUE> was determined. (PMID:

18694759)

 

Therefore in this study we have relaxed the requirement widely
used in previous studies that an effective description of a relation
between two entities must contain both entities (Bui et (11., 2011;
Jang et (11., 2006). However, if only considering the sentence of
Example 2, it is difﬁcult to know the ligand. In AutoBind, the PDB
TITLE, which was written by the author of the structure to describe
the main molecules in the structure, is adopted to overcome this
problem. The PDB TITLE corresponding to Example 2 (PDB ID:
3CTR) is ‘Crystal structure of the RRM-domain of the poly(A)-
speciﬁc ribonuclease PARN bound to m7GTP’. The protein and
ligand names are PARN and m7GTP, respectively. Thus, AutoBind
can restore the missing ligand name in Example 2 to m7GTP.

It is worthwhile to note that an article may contain multiple
descriptions of binding afﬁnities but some of them correspond to
ligands not of interest. The biologically relevant ligand in this work is
deﬁned as (i) non-covalently bound to the protein and (ii) formed an
unambiguously complex with the protein. However, in some cases,
two ligands bind together inside the same binding site on the protein.
In such cases, experimental measurement of the binding afﬁnity of
each individual ligand becomes much more complicated. In a PDB
ﬁle, there could be some biologically irrelevant ligands [e.g. GOL
(glycerol) in PDB entry 3GBA, where glycerol was added to the
solution as a cryoprotectant] that were crystallized along with the
main molecules. In the TITLE records of the 1486 PDB entries of the
PDBbind_c0rpus, only 58 do not describe the biologically relevant
ligands and none of them describes biologically irrelevant ligands.
Thus in practice, we resorted to the TITLE record in a PDB ﬁle,
which was written by the author of the structure to describe the
main molecules in the structure, to identify the biologically relevant
ligands. For example, Examples 3 and 4 are two descriptions of
protein—ligand-binding afﬁnity in the same primary Citation of a
complex structure (PDB ID: 2HAW; PMID: 17095506). Example 3
describe the afﬁnities of PPase binding with Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions,
both of which are not the ligand of interest for family II PPase.

 

Interestingly, M 3*” <LIGAND> confers lower activity
but greater substrate-binding afﬁnity on/PREP family 11
PPases<PROTEIN> than Mn2+ <LIGAND> (Kd of
6011M versus 180 i1M)<VALUE>, whereas, in family I
enzymes, the reverse is true.

Example 3

 

In contrast, Example 4 shows the Kd value (60 11M) of family
II PPase binding with PNP, which is the ligand of interest in the

includes three stages: (1) text preprocessing, (2) sentence extraction and

other published databases, (B) full-sentenced descriptions where the binding

their very similar three-dimensional structures.

 

In this study, Example 4 was treated as an effective binding afﬁnity
and was collected in AutoBind; while Example 3 was not.

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The PDB release in September 2011 contained 76114 entries from 32 986
primary citations, which are the original published articles of the afﬁnity
measurement for the corresponding proteiniligand complex. We collected
17 221 articles whose full text is publicly accessible. The binding afﬁnities of
1586 articles of the 17 221 primary citations were annotated in the PDBbind
database release of September 2011. We named the 1586 full-text articles as
PDBbind_corpus and adopted the corresponding binding afﬁnities as a gold
standard to evaluate the performance of our automatic extraction method. We
used 100 articles from PDBbind_corpus to construct the four patterns (see
Section 3.2.2) and used the remaining 1486 articles as the testing corpus.
The workﬂow of constructing AutoBind is shown in Figure 1. In automatic
extraction phase, it includes three major stages: (i) text preprocessing, (ii)
sentence extraction and (iii) sentence ranking. AutoBind also provides a
friendly web-based interface for users to query and View the identiﬁed

binding afﬁnity. The details of each stage in Figure 1 are described in
the following subsections. The last subsection describes a naive extraction
algorithm we implemented as a comparison baseline.

3.1 Text preprocessing

AutoBind ﬁrst splits full text into sentences and marks the protein and ligand
names in sentences using named entity recognition (NER). We used a protein
name recognizer, NLProt (Mika and Rest, 2004), and a lexicon, UniProt
(Bairoch at 611., 2005), to recognize protein names. If a term is (i) recognized
as protein name by NLProt or (ii) identical to a protein name/synonym in
UniProt, it is marked as a protein name. Namely, AutoBind used the union
of the results of NLProt and UniProt as the protein names. Similarly, we
used a compound name recognizer, OSCAR4 (Jessop at 611., 2011), and a
chemical molecules databases, PubChem (Wang at 611., 2009), to recognize
ligand names. As protein recognition, the union of the results of OSCAR4
and PubChem was used as the ligand names. The detailed information about
the used NER tools can be found in the supplementary data.

To solve the problem of name variants, including orthographic variation
(e.g. ‘EBNA3’, ‘EBNA-3’ and ‘EBNA 3’), Greek alphabet letter (e.g. ‘p38
alpha” and ‘p38 01’) and extra words (e.g. ‘TRAM’ and ‘TRAM protein”),
AutoBind converted Greek alphabet letters to the corresponding English
letters and removed three speciﬁc words ‘protein’, ‘gene’ and ‘product’.
Abbreviation discrimination is another critical problem in NER (Zhou at 611.,
2006). In AutoBind, if a name is followed by a parentheses-surrounded term,
this term is dynamically labeled as an abbreviation to that name. The protein
and ligand abbreviations are considered identical to the protein and ligand
names in the following stages.

Frequently, there are multiple binding afﬁnities in a full-text article
that, for example, correspond to the binding under different experimental
conditions or the binding of the wild-type and mutated proteins. To identify
the target protein and ligand of the extracted article, however, is difﬁcult
and requires much domain knowledge. Examples 3 and 4 in the previous
section demonstrated that the title of the complex structure is a sentence
well describing the crystal structure. In this study we focus on the afﬁnity
corresponding to the crystal structure and adopted the PDB TITLE to make
the step of selecting protein and ligand in an article automated. Therefore,
we also used NER to recognize protein and ligand names in the PDB TITLE.
The recognized names were used to select binding afﬁnity records later. The
beneﬁt of this strategy is that the extracted binding afﬁnity is guaranteed to
have a corresponding proteiniligand complex structure.

3.2 Sentence extraction

3.2.1 Trigger detection Trigger is usually a noun, noun phrase (NP), verb
or verb phrase (VP), used to detect relation or event between entities in a
sentence (Stapley and Benoit, 2000). Setting a collection of triggers is a useful
practice to rapidly ﬁlter large sentences in a full-text article before deeper
parsing. AutoBind deﬁned two types of triggers to detect <VALUE>, Tvalue,
and <EVENT>, Tevem. Table 1 shows the 19 Tvalue and Table 2 shows the
seven Tevem identiﬁed by examining PDBbind_corpus manually. Each word
in Tevem stands for all its morphological variations.

In AutoBind, <VALUE> is more precisely deﬁned by four components:
trigger, Sign, value and unit, such as ‘Kd = 26 11M” (‘Kd’z trigger; ‘2’: Sign;
‘26”: value and ‘MM’: unit). The four components are not required to be
consecutive (e.g. ‘shows a K; value of 0.77 11M” in PMID: 18596699 is a
valid <VALUE> in AutoBind). To simplify the following steps, AutoBind
rearranges <VALUE> to its compact form as follows:

(1) Identify the position of Tvalue in the sentence.

(2) Extract the words from the position of Tvalue to the ﬁrst encountered
unit term (mM, 11M, nM and pM).

(3) If all of trigger, value and unit are present in the extracted words,
AutoBind rearranges them into the form of ‘trigger = value unit”.

Here we use the sentence ‘We ﬁrst showed that Ap5G is an efﬁcient
inhibitor of EcGMPK, with an IC50 of about 0.5 11M” (PMID: 16690197) as

an example. The trigger ‘IC50’ is ﬁrst identiﬁed. Then ‘IC50 of about 0.5 11M”
is extracted and parsed. The ﬁnal <VALUE> in this example is rearranged
as ‘IC50 = 0.50M”.

3.2.2 Pattern matching After trigger detection, the remaining sentences
that contain triggers are matched to the following patterns. The four patterns
were based on manually reviewing 100 articles randomly selected from the
PDBbind_corpus. In each of the pattern-based sentence patterns listed below,
a symbol ‘-’ indicates a word gap that can be ﬁlled with any number of words
within the sentence. A token followed by a symbol “2’ indicates that the token
is optional.

 

<P/L> — <EVENT> — <P/L> - BEV/PREP -
<VALUE>

The enzyme from S. pombe was the ﬁrst described
lumazine synthase<PROTEIN> that was found to

bind <EVENT> riboﬂavin <LIGAND> with/PREP
relatively high afﬁnity (KD of 1.2 11M) <VALUE>.
(PMID: 12083520)

Kinetic assays showed that pteroic acid <LIGAND> could
inhibit<EVENT> RTA<PROTEIN> activity with/PREP
an apparent K of 0.6 mM <VALUE>. (PMID: 9086280)

Pattern 1

Example 5

Example 6

 

Pattern 1 accommodates for a typical description of a protein combined
with a small molecular. The <P/L> (short of <PROTEIN>/<LIGAND>)
indicates the protein/ligand names recognized by NER, <EVENT> indicates
triggers recognized by Tevem and <VALUE> indicates triggers recognized
by Tvalue. A speciﬁc rule for the patterns containing two <P/L>s is that
one must be <PROTEIN> and the other must be <LIGAND> with
no order restrictions. BEV (to be verb) or PREP (preposition) connects
<PROTEIN> and <LIGAND> to <VALUE>. Example 5 describes that
lumazine synthase binds with riboﬂavin, where the binding afﬁnity evaluated
by the dissociation constant (K!) is 1.2 11M. Example 6 shows an example
where <LIGAND> appeared before <PROTEIN>.

Pattern 2 is designed to identify descriptions of passive form. In this
pattern, <EVENT> is in between <PROTEIN> and <LIGAND>, and
<VALUE> is at end of the sentence.

 

Pattern 2 <P/L> - BEV - <EVENT> - PREP -
<P/L> — <VALUE>
Example 7 0XA-13 <PROTEIN> was found to be/BEV

inhibited <EVENT> efﬁciently by<PREP> imipenem and
meropenem <LIGAND> (IC50 = 0.02 11M) <VALUE>.
(PMID: 11453693)

 

Pattern 3 accommodates sentences where <PROTEIN> and
<LIGAND> are connected with a BEV or PREP rather than <EVENT>.
The design of Pattern 3 is distinct to previous IR studies requiring a verb
to link two entities (Bui et a1., 2011; Fundel et a1., 2007). However, we
observed that some sentences contain binding afﬁnities even without any
Tevent (Example 8)-

 

Pattern 3
Example 8

<P/L> - BEV/PREP - <P/L> - (BEV)? - <VALUE>
The afﬁnity of I219A hGSTAI -1 <PROTEIN> for/PREP
GTX<LIGAND> (K; = 1.3 11M, 25 °C)<VALUE> is an
order of magnitude weaker than that of the wild-type
protein (K; 20.07 11M, 25 °C)<VALUE>. (PMID:
15893769)

 

Pattern 4 is a commonly observed writing style which describes the result
(<VALUE>) ﬁrst and then the details (<P/L>s and <EVENT>). Example
9 is an example of this pattern. <EVENT> in sentences of this pattern is
not used to connect entities and could be omitted.

 

<VALUE> - PREP - <P/L> — <EVENT/BEV>?

The K i values of 44 and 220 11M <VALUE> for/PREP

(S )-and (R)-pr0pran0101<LIGAND>, respectively, show
that the (S)-form binds<EVENT> almost as strong as the
natural product cellobiose [K12011M], whereas the binding
of the (R)-form is about 5 times weaker. (PMID:

1 1 1 14249)

3.3 Sentence ranking

The sentences extracted from a full-text article in the previous stages were
denoted S =C1si), where s, is the ith extracted sentence matching at least
one of the deﬁned patterns. In this stage, AutoBind ranks S with a scoring
function shown below. In evaluation, a successful extraction is counted if it
is retrieved in the three highest ranked sentences. The experimental results
shown in the next section reveal that the correct binding afﬁnity appeared in
the top three sentences in 79.07% articles.

gi=ﬂ (2)

Fi=ﬁ+gt (3)

where a) is the number of distinct protein and ligand names in all extracted
sentences in the article, y is the set of protein and ligand names in the
corresponding PDB TITLE, f, measures the overlap of protein and ligand
names of S to the corresponding PDB TITLE, ei is the number of protein
and ligand names ins, and g, is the ratio of entities in s, that are also in the
corresponding PDB TITLE. In other words, )3 measures the correlation of
the article to the PDB TITLE, gi measures the correlation of s, to the PDB
TITLE, while F i is the sum of the two measures. The ﬁnal score, F i, is the
sum off, and g.

The P-values of NLProt to the other two methods are < 1E— 10; the P-value between

3.4 Co-occurrence method

As AutoBind is the ﬁrst automatic extraction system dedicated for protein7
ligand binding afﬁnity, we implemented an algorithm that simply identiﬁes
sentences containing both the target protein and ligand. This algorithm,
named sentence-level co-occurrence method in other studies (He et a1.,
2009), was adopted as a comparison baseline.

4 BENCHMARKING

4.1 Evaluation of binding afﬁnity extraction

Table 3 shows that AutoBind could extract sentences containing
the correct binding afﬁnity with 84.22% precision and 79.07%
recall, where the P-value of the Wilcoxon signed ranked sum
test (Wilcoxon, 1947) to the baseline is < 1E — 10 (the evaluation
metrics are explained in the Supplementary Data). Comparing with
AutoBind, the low recall of the co-occurrence method is mainly due
to requiring both protein and ligand to appear in the sentence. The
results indicate that more than half of the binding afﬁnity articles
describe the correct binding afﬁnities in sentences not containing
either the target protein or ligand. This reveals the importance of
relaxing the requirement of the presence of entities in the proposed
patterns. An analysis of the errors of AutoBind and a discussion of
the limitation of AutoBind can be found in the Supplementary Data.

4.2 Evaluation of NER

The NER module of AutoBind was actually a union of a dictionary-
and a learning-based method (see Section 3.1 for details). In
this experiment, we compared the performance of the dictionary-
based method, the learning-based method and their union (denoted
Hybrid in the context). The results of NER performance for protein
and ligand names are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.
Table 4 shows that using both techniques outperformed the protein
recognition performance over those using individual techniques.
The P-values show that the differences of NLProt to UniProt
and Hybrid were relatively signiﬁcant than the difference between
UniProt and Hybrid. Namely, the good performance of Hybrid
came mainly from UniProt with a little Hybrid came mainly from
UniProt with a little help from NLProt in protein recognition. This

 

The P-values of any two methods are < 1E— 10.

enhancement was also observed in ligand recognition (Table 5).
The P-values show that the differences of Hybrid to the two
individual methods were signiﬁcant. Namely, combining PubChem
and OSCAR4 signiﬁcantly helps ligand recognition. In both protein
and ligand name recognition, the dictionary-based methods achieved
better precision than that using learning-based methods. On the other
hand, dictionary-based methods may have many false negatives
because some new compound names have not been collected
in the adopted dictionary. For example, ligand recognition using
PubChem had lower recall than that using OSCAR4. This problem
was relatively moderate in protein recognition (comparing NLProt
and UniProt in Table 4) since the catalogue of proteins is more
mature than that of ligands. Our results concur with previous studies
that hybridizing both techniques enhances recognition performance
(Wermter et (11., 2009).

The next question is whether the improvement of hybridizing
dictionary- and learning-based techniques in entity recognition
beneﬁts the performance of afﬁnity extraction. Many studies
that used IR technologies to extract biomedical information, e.g.
protein—protein interaction (Zhou and He, 2008) and protein
phosphorylation (Hu et (11., 2005), observed that a large amount of
incorrect extractions were owing to the poor recognition of protein
entities. Many incorrect words or phrases tagged as entities will
largely increase the false-positive extractions and reduce the entire
extraction performance. We carried out an evaluation of the binding
afﬁnity extraction using the dictionary-based, the learning-based and
the hybrid method. The experiment shows the hybrid recognition
scheme used in this study can effectively improve the performance
of binding afﬁnity extraction. The results are shown in Table 6.
Note that the precisions, recalls and F -scores in Table 6 are the
performance of afﬁnity extraction, namely comparable with those in
Table 3, and should not be compared with those in Tables 4 and 5.
The results reveal that accurate NER is critical to afﬁnity extraction.
This conclusion is similar to the study of Kim et (11. (2009).
Furthermore, the P-values show that the differences of Learning to
Dictionary and Hybrid were relatively signiﬁcant than the difference
between Dictionary and Hybrid. The results in Tables 4 and 5 suggest
that the relatively small difference between Dictionary and Hybrid
was due to the small difference in protein recognition.

4.3 Comparison with other databases

During the past decade, several protein—ligand binding afﬁnity
databases were published, in which all of the collected data were
based on manual reading (Table 7). LPDB is the earliest database,
containing 195 complexes with binding afﬁnities. A main feature
of LPDB is providing computer-generated ‘docking decoys’ for
developing and testing docking methods. BindingDB, ﬁrst published
in 2001, collected experimentally determined binding afﬁnities of
small molecules used for drug discovery. It provides various search

facilities of, for example, compound names, chemical structures and
binding afﬁnities, for accessing the collected data. AfﬁnDB collected
binding afﬁnities from two kinds of scientiﬁc literatures: (i) primary
sources describing the original experiments of afﬁnity determination
and (ii) secondary references collecting many binding afﬁnities from
primary references. It also provided experiment details such as
pH values and temperature. Before 2010, Binding MOAD was the
largest database that screened the entire PDB for primary citations
containing binding afﬁnities, but it has not been updated since 2010.
It did not include small organic molecules or cofactors. PDBbind was
another database that performed PDB-wide extraction. The most
recent update of PDBbind is on September 22, 2011 (version 2011).
Except PDBbind, other databases are rarely updated. AutoBind
contains 13 616 protein—ligand-binding afﬁnities of which 6217
were automatically extracted (45.66%) and 7399 were curated by
experts. It contains almost twice binding afﬁnities compared to other
databases of similar data. The guideline of AutoBind to the experts
can be found in the Supplementary Data.

Furthermore, AutoBind is updated every month. The higher
update frequency is achieved by the automatic extraction system
that alleviates manual loading. For each update, the newly
released structures and the primary citations will be automatically
downloaded from PDB and PubMed. The processing binding afﬁnity
extraction of each article takes 1 min in average using an Intel
Xeon 2.5 GHz processor. Additionally, we adopted AutoBind early
release version (updated on September 2011, 11 897 afﬁnities were
collected) to carry out a simple test to estimate the time needed for
a biologist to review and record binding afﬁnity data from protein

structure-related articles. Our curators took ~20 days to conﬁrm the
5160 automatically extracted binding afﬁnities while took about 3
months without the assistance of the automatic system to extract
the other 6737 binding afﬁnities. This reveals the importance
of automatic extraction, which facilitated manual curation, hence
drastically reducing the required time.

5 CONCLUSION

This work presents a new automatic system, AutoBind, for
extracting protein-binding afﬁnity from literature. Overall, our
automatic extraction method collected almost twice binding
afﬁnities compared to other databases of similar data. The automatic
extraction process contains four NER methods for protein and ligand
names, four sentences patterns for sentence extraction and a ranking
method to pick sentence that correctly describes binding afﬁnities.
The experimental results show that hybridizing multiple NER
methods improved the performance of binding afﬁnity extraction.
These sentence patterns can quickly identify candidate sentences that
may contain a protein-binding afﬁnity. These patterns were designed
to ensure minimal false negatives for, as shown in the experimental
results, high extraction recall. Finally, the proposed ranking method
ensures minimal false positives for high precision. The rank-based
design facilities the following manual checking step. Biologists can
start from the highest ranked sentences and stop immediately after a
correct sentence is found. The entire system signiﬁcantly reduces the
extraction time while preserving the quality of the extracted binding
afﬁnities.

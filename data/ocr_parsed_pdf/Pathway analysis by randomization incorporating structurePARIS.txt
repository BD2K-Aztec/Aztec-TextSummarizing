Abstract

Motivation: We present an update to the pathway enrichment analysis tool 'Pathway Analysis by
Randomization Incorporating Structure (PARIS)’ that determines aggregated association signals gen—
erated from genome—wide association study results. Pathway—based analyses highlight biological
pathways associated with phenotypes. PARIS uses a unique permutation strategy to evaluate the
genomic structure of interrogated pathways, through permutation testing of genomic features, thus
eliminating many of the over—testing concerns arising with other pathway analysis approaches.
Results: We have updated PARIS to incorporate expanded pathway definitions through the incorp—
oration of new expert knowledge from multiple database sources, through customized user
provided pathways, and other improvements in user flexibility and functionality.

Availability and implementation: PARIS is freely available to all users at https://ritchie|ab.psu.edu/

1 Introduction

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in iden—
tifying genetic variants that have revealed new insights into the genetic
architecture of complex human diseases and traits. However, most re—
ported GWAS variants confer only incremental risk and only explain a
small proportion of disease heritability (Manolio et (11., 2009).

Pathway analysis algorithms were created to aggregate single—
variant statistical analysis results (Yaspan and Veatch, 2011) to
identify pathways with enrichment of genetic associations. These
build a higher level abstraction of single—variant data and collapse it
into biologically informed gene sets comprising pathways.

Version 1.0 of the Pathway Analysis by Randomization
Incorporating Structure (PARIS) tool was created to evaluate

aggregated association signals generated from GWAS experiments
across pathways of interest including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database (Yaspan et (11.,
2011). PARIS groups the SNPs into linkage disequilibrium (LD) and
linkage equilibrium (LE) features, defined based on available LD in—
formation for the population of interest. These features are further
grouped into pathways (defined by online or manually curated sour—
ces) and analysis is performed using a file defining the composition
of the defined pathways of interest, a file containing the association
statistics, and a file defining the LD block regions for the target
population. The significance of a pathway is determined by permu—
tation testing of random pathways of similar composition

(composed of LD and LE blocks of similar size) (Yaspan et (11.,
2011). In each permutation, the features in a pathway are replaced
by a randomly selected set of features of similar size and number,
thus mimicking the physical features of the pathway of interest. The
total number of features with a significant P—value is compared be—
tween the true and random pathways. If the pathway of interest con—
tains a higher number of significant features than the random
pathways, the pathway of interest will then be considered signifi—
cant. This approach was chosen to minimize execution time, to
allow for a more ﬂexible user input, and to correct the analysis for
genome structure. PARIS additionally allows for assessment of the
contribution of each gene to the overall pathway signal, providing
information about whether or not it appears many genes are contri—
buting to a signal, or instead one gene with many significant features
contributes to the signal detected for a specific pathway. This pro—
vides a faster method compared to other methods that re—compute
association statistics. The method by which PARIS corrects for gene
size and LD were extensively tested and were reported in the previ—
ous article (Yaspan et (11., 2011).

The PARIS program only requires GWAS results that meet the
input requirements (i.e. include variant/position, chromosome num—
ber and P—value).

Here we describe PARIS v2.4, a new Python implementation of
PARIS, as part of the Biofilter 2.0 software suite (Pendergrass et (11.,
2013).

2 Results

2.1 Novel features
Figure 1A outlines the updates to PARIS 2.4, where orange elements
represent changes to the software tool.

The previous version 1.0 of PARIS was designed as a stand—alone
program. Now, we have updated and adapted PARIS 2.4 to be part
of Biofilter 2.0, which, via the Library of Knowledge Integration
database, allows broader access to external databases, including
KEGG, Gene Ontology (GO), Reactome, BioGRID, MINT, Pfam,
PharmGKB and NetPath, in addition to manually curated pathways
and provides a more ﬂexible and user—friendly command line user
interface.

As a result of integrating PARIS into Biolfilter 2.0, analysis op—
tions are extended to include all of those available in the Biofilter
program (Pendergrass et (11., 2013).

Additionally, users now have the option to prioritize the permu—
tation space to increase execution performance and omit unneces—
sary calculations for low—impact variants (with P—value above a
user—defined threshold) that do not contribute to the final result.
PARIS permutations will terminate early if the user specified P—value
threshold is reached.

As part of the improved user interface, PARIS 2.4 now allows
for better error identification compared to the previous version.
Input errors will print to the screen or logfile when encountered.
Additionally, PARIS 2.4 now channels error—prone results to an out—
put file that separates unused input to ‘.invalid.’ files. One new op—
tion is the ability to correct for errors in variant position mapping.
In the case that a variant was mapped to a wrong chromosome, the
program automatically re—maps the variant to the correct chromo—
some. This change is tracked in the log file and can be checked by
the user.

A crucial new aspect in PARIS version 2.4 is the extension of fea—
ture boundaries. These can now be expanded beyond physical gene
boundaries to match variants within user—specified distances outside

2.2 Performance validation

We executed PARIS on GWAS results from N480 k SNPs evaluated
by the NEIGHBOR consortium (Bailey et (11., 2014; Wiggs et (11.,
2012). Comparing results from a prior version of PARIS (1.1.3) to
this new version (2.4), results are highly correlated (Fig. 1B and C)
for the 199 overlapping KEGG pathways, using gene boundary
thresholds of 0 and 50 kb. To provide a comprehensive and un—
biased comparison, we utilized the database and pathway definition
files that were previously utilized with version 1.1.3 of PARIS
(Bailey et (11., 2014). Pathway P—values were highly correlated, as
indicated in Figure 1B and C. Further, we evaluated the number of
pathways attaining P < 0.05 (Table 1) and found that with both the

0 and 50 kb gene boundary extension options, the same pathways
achieved this significance threshold, except in one case, where a
pathway was P < 0.05 in the prior version of PARIS and P 2 0.05 in
the updated version due to difference in random number generation
between the two versions. These results validate the performance
consistency between the two versions of PARIS.

3 Discussion

PARIS was originally developed to evaluate the non—random ag—
gregation of common variant single-marker GWAS signals that
do not necessarily attain GWAS—level significance but that ap—
proach significance and aggregate in biological pathways of inter—
est, thus providing a method by which to detect the presence of
concomitant biological trends across pathways and other connec—
tions between genes and biological features in terms of genetic
associations.

The prior version of PARIS had limited access to outdated data—
bases. As part of the Biofilter 2.0 package, PARIS 2.4 now accesses
updated knowledge sources, thus relaying the most pertinent biolo—
gical information relevant to analysis. PARIS 2.4 now incorporates
a more user—friendly interface, in addition to accessing the options
available in Biofilter 2.0 (Pendergrass et (11., 2013).

Limitations of PARIS include that results are limited to the
scope of the input data, i.e. if GWAS results from an array with
poor genomic coverage are evaluated by PARIS, the pathways of
interest will necessarily be limited to those with variants present in
the input. Additionally, PARIS 2.4 includes LD information from
European populations (CEU); however, user—defined LD defin—
itions can be used. Future versions will incorporate more diverse
LD definitions.

In conclusion, PARIS version 2.4 allows for more ﬂexible and
extended utilization beyond the initial version 1.0 (Yaspan et (11.,

2011) while also giving results that are consistent with the original
implementation and thus providing an updated tool for secondary
pathway analysis of genome—wide data.

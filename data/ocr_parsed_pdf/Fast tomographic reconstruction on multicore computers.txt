ABSTRACT

Summary: Tomo3D implements a multithreaded vectorized
approach to tomographic reconstruction that takes full advantage of
the computer power in modern multicore computers. Full resolution
tomograms are generated at high speed on standard computers
with no special system requirements. Tomo3D has the most
common reconstruction methods implemented, namely weighted
Back-projection (WBP) and simultaneous iterative reconstruction
technique (SIRT). It proves to be competitive with current graphic
processor unit solutions in terms of processing time, in the order
of a few seconds with WBP or minutes with SIRT. The program is
compatible with standard packages, which easily allows integration
in the electron tomography workflow.

1 INTRODUCTION

Electron tomography (ET) allows visualization of complex
specimens in its native cellular context at near-molecular
resolution (Lucic et (11., 2005). A series of projection images is
taken with an electron microscope from a unique biological sample
at different orientations around a single tilt axis. Tomographic
reconstruction algorithms then combine those images so as to derive
the 3D structure of the specimen. The number of images in the series
usually ranges from 60 to 200. Due to the resolution needs, the
image size generally ranges between 1024 X 1024 and 2048 X 2048
pixels, though 4096 X 4096 can now be used as well. Weighted Back-
projection (WBP) is the standard reconstruction method. Iterative
methods, such as Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique
(SIRT), exhibit better performance in ET (Lucic et (11., 2005).
However, they demand much longer processing time, which has
prevented their extensive use so far.

The complexity of the algorithms along with the data size turns 3D
reconstruction into a computational intensive problem. Traditionally,
high performance computing has been used to cope with the
demands in ET (Fernandez, 2008). Recently, the use of graphics
processor units (GPUs) has revolutionized the ﬁeld as they provide
exceptional performance-to-cost ratio (Castano-Diez et (11., 2007;
Vazquez et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2010), though a relatively speciﬁc

hardware component, the GPU, is still necessary. Current stand-
alone computers present tremendous power, thanks to technological
and architectural advances (Hennessy and Patterson, 2007), but they
still have not been fully exploited in the ﬁeld.

We present a program, Tomo3D, that implements an approach
to tomographic reconstruction based on the ﬁill use of the
computational power within modern multicore computers. It takes
advantage of the multiple cores and of the vector instructions
within the cores, and also uses general code optimization techniques
to make the most of the computers. The program signiﬁcantly
accelerates the 3D reconstruction methods WBP and SIRT, and
even outperforms current GPU solutions. Furthermore, this program
enables real-time tomography on standard multicore computers,
without the need for clusters or GPUs.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Current computers usually ship with one or more multicore processor
chips. every one comprising several powerful cores (e.g. dual-2. quad-4.
hexa-6). Moreover. the individual cores contain vector instructions. typically
known as SIMD (Single Instruction. Multiple Data). which perform
multiple computations with different data elements of the same kind
simultaneously (Hassaballah at al.. 2008). In particular. the SSE instructions
(Streaming SIMD Extensions). present in all Intel and AMD processors.
can perform four ﬂoating-point operations of the same type (addition.
multiplication. etc) with their corresponding four pairs of operands. These
features turn current computers into extremelly powerful platforms with
two levels of parallelism available for the programmer: threads and SSE
instructions to exploit cores and vector units within the cores. respectively.

The 3D reconstruction problem in ET can be decomposed into a
set of independent 2D reconstruction sub-problems corresponding to the
slices perpendicular to the tilt axis. This has traditionally been the data
decomposition used in ET for high-performance computing (Fernandez.
2008; Zheng et al.. 2007). Each of the 2D slices of the volume can then
be computed with any of the reconstruction methods. either WBP or SIRT
but now working in 2D. from the corresponding set of 1D projections. The
reconstruction of the independent slices can then be carried out in parallel.

Tomo3D uses a multithreaded-vectorized approach to tomographic
reconstruction (Fig. 1). It relies on the Single Program. Multiple Data
(SPMD) paradigm whereby the different threads essentially execute the
same task over different data. The program creates a number of threads.
typically as many as cores in the computer. that run in parallel. The program
keeps a pool with the slices to reconstruct. clustered in slabs of four slices.
The slabs are asynchronously dispatched to the threads when these become
idle. When a slab is alloted to a thread. its four slices are reconstructed
simultaneously. thanks to the SSE instructions (Agulleiro et al.. 2010). Once
a thread ﬁnishes the reconstruction of the slab. it requests for another one. The
fact that slabs are dispatched on demand provides an inherent load-balancing
mechanism (Wilkinson and Allen. 2005). and makes Tomo3D ﬂexible to
adapt to situations where the computer is shared by several users/programs.

Tomo3D has been implemented in C under Linux. using Pthreads and
SSE intrinsics. Single-core code optimization techniques have also been
used to better exploit the memory hierarchy and the internal processing units
within the cores (Agulleiro et al.. 2010). Memory consumption has been
reduced to a minimum. only keeping a small subset of slabs and precomputed
tables (e.g. cosines. etc.) used throughout the reconstruction process. I/O
operations have been optimized to reduce disk latencies. Tomo3D is equipped
with the two most common reconstruction methods in the ﬁeld: WBP and
SIRT. For the iterative method SIRT. a number of options are available:
the positivity constraint that ensures that all the points in the reconstruction
be positive. a weighting to compensate the ‘long object effect” (Xu et al..
2010) and the possibility of resuming a reconstruction with more iterations.
Tomo3D reads tilt-series and writes the output tomograms in MRC format
and is fully compatible with standard ET packages (e.g. IMOD). Tomo3D is
provided as a stand-alone. download-and-go. program that does not require
any special hardware or software library in the system. which makes it
especially attractive for structural biology laboratories. The program is freely
available for predominant processing plaftorms and can be built for other
platforms on request to authors.

3 ILLUSTRATIVE PERFORMANCE TESTING

To illustrate the performance of Tomo3D in typical structural studies by
ET. we used tilt-series of 70 and 140 images of sizes 1024 X 1024 and
2048 X 2048 to yield volumes of 1024 X 1024 X 256 and 2048 X 2048 X 256.
The computation was carried out on a state-of—the-art server with two quad-
core processors Intel Xeon E5405 at 2.0GHz and on a standard desktop
computer with a quad-core processor Intel Core 2 Q9550 at 2.83 GHz under
Linux. Both reconstruction methods. WBP and SIRT (30 iterations) were
tested. The experiments were carried out using eight threads on the server
(denoted by 8T) and four threads on the desktop computer (denoted by 4T).
For comparison. the reconstructions were also computed using the standard
package in the ﬁeld (see Supplementary Data).

Table 1 shows the processing times required by Tomo3D for the different
experiments as well as the average speedup factors (based upon the time
required by a single core with no use of vector instructions). As far as the
processing time is concerned. Tomo3D succeeds in yielding full resolution
reconstructions with WBP in the order of seconds (3727 s and 2716 s with 4 or
8 cores. respectively). which enables it for real-time ET (Zheng et al.. 2007).
Even more interestingly. Tomo3D is able to provide iterative reconstructions
in just a few minutes (3723 min and 2716mm. respectively).

Finally. Tomo3D was compared to the most advanced GPU solution in the
ﬁeld. Areconstruction of 1424 X 2024 X 591 was computed from 61 images of

solution.

4 CONCLUSION

The multithreaded-vectorized approach to tomographic reconstruc-
tion in Tomo3D allows computation of full resolution tomograms
at high speed on standard computers. There are no special system
requirements to run the program and, ﬁirthermore, it is fully
compatible with standard packages in the ﬁeld. All these are the
major contributions of Tomo3D from the user’s point of view. The
good performance of Tomo3D stems from the full exploitation of
the computing power latent in modern multicore computers. The
processing time required by the methods implemented in Tomo3D,
WBP and SIRT, turns out to be competitive with GPUs.

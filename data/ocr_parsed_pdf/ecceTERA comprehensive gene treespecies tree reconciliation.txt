Abstract

Summary: A gene tree—species tree reconciliation explains the evolution of a gene tree within the
species tree given a model of gene—family evolution. We describe ecceTERA, a program that imple—
ments a generic parsimony reconciliation algorithm, which accounts for gene duplication, loss and
transfer (DTL) as well as speciation, involving sampled and unsampled lineages, within undated,
fully dated or partially dated species trees. The ecceTERA reconciliation model and algorithm gen—
eralize or improve upon most published DTL parsimony algorithms for binary species trees and
binary gene trees. Moreover, ecceTERA can estimate accurate species—tree aware gene trees using

amalgamation.

Availability and implementation: ecceTERA is freely available under http://mbb.univ—montp2.fr/

1 Introduction

Reconciling gene trees with a species tree (Goodman et (11., 1979;
Page, 1994) is a crucial step in many phylogenomics problems
(Rusin et (11., 2014); from the reconstruction of gene trees (Bansal
et (11., 2015; David and Alm, 2010; Nguyen et (11., 2012;
Scornavacca et (11., 2015; Szollo'si and Daubin, 2012) to the recon-
struction of ancestral genomes (Chauve et al., 2013; Széllési et (11.,
2015). Internal gene tree nodes; representing ancestral genes; are as-
signed to species (extant or extinct) and evolutionary events such as
gene duplications or horizontal transfers. This results in evolution-
ary histories (or reconciliations) for gene families explaining appar-
ent discordances with the speciation history.

There exist several reconciliation software packages—such as
Notung (Durand et (11., 2006; Stolzer et (11., 2012); RANGER—DTL

(Bansal et (11., 2012); Mowgli (Doyon et (11., 2010); Eucalypt
(Donati et (11., 2015); AngST (David and Alm, 2010) and Jane
(Conow et (11., 2010)—whose algorithms and models; differ; some-
times in subtle ways; in terms of the evolutionary events they con-
sider (Doyon et (11., 2011). Furthermore; an important difference lies
in the nature of the species tree. First; some software packages as-
sume that the considered species tree is fully dated (i.e. speciation
dates are provided) and ensure that horizontal transfers are time-
consistent (i.e. that no transfer can occur between species that did
not exist at the same time; see Doyon et (11., 2010); while others en-
sure only local time-consistency (Bansal et (11., 2012). But other soft-
ware packages do consider undated species trees (i.e. the timing of
speciation events is not known); and; as ensuring time-consistency
with undated trees is an NP-hard problem (Hallett et (11., 2004;

reconciliation, where S is the species tree, G the gene tree and k the
number of dated nodes of S. The use of a single algorithm ensures
that, when comparing the results obtained on the same data with
different models (for example to evaluate the impact of a speciation
time), the observed differences can be attributed to differences in the

2 Methods

We introduce ecceTERA, a program whose aim is to compute parsi—
monious reconciliations between species trees and gene trees under a
comprehensive evolutionary model. The program ecceTERA im—

proves upon existing parsimony reconciliation software in several

aspects. In Table 1 we show how ecceTERA compares to the most Issues'

reconciliations for the chosen evolutionary model, as described in

Scornavacca et al. (2013). It is also possible to associate support val—

Finally, an important feature of ecceTERA is its ability to recon—

gene loss, gene transfer and transfer—loss (gene transfer with loss of
the original gene) between two sampled species, and gene transfer

species that a significant number of gene transfers that occurred in
the past could reasonably be transfers from/to unsampled species. A
more detailed description of the evolutionary model of ecceTERA is
provided in the Supplementary Material.

Also, ecceTERA, can take as input a species tree that is either

ecceTERA is a command line software written in C++, using
the Bio ++ (Guéguen et al., 2013) and BOOST C ++ libraries, and
is available as source code. It has been tested on the Mac and Linux
platforms, for which executables are provided. It requires input trees

3 Case study

We applied ecceTERA to the reconstruction of species—tree aware
gene trees using the joint amalgamation method presented in
Scornavacca et al. (2015), under several evolutionary models. The
tests were performed on a dataset composed of a dated species tree
of 36 cyanobacteria and a set of 1099 gene trees obtained from
simulated alignments generated as described in Szollési et al.
(2013a, Supplementary Material). We found that using a dated spe—
cies tree and a full evolutionary model, including transfer—loss and
transfer from/to extinct or unsampled species, achieves the highest
accuracy, with a mean Robinson—Foulds (RF) distance of 9.42 to
the true trees; this corresponds to the model described in
Scornavacca et al. (2015). Excluding transfer from/to extinct or
unsampled species led to a larger mean RF distance of 9.78, while
considering the species as undated provided the worst results, with
mean RF distances slightly above 10. These experiments are
described in more detail in the Supplementary Material.

To assess its computational efficiency, we compared ecceTERA
to RANGER—DTL (Bansal et al., 2012), the most efficient parsimony
software available to date, using three large datasets—COG,
CYANO and HOGENOM—described in detail in the
Supplementary Material. The default parameters were used for both
programs. For the COG and CYANO datasets the running times
and memory requirements of the two programs were comparable
while, on the HOGENOM dataset (see Supplementary Fig. S3),
ecceTERA was faster, by a mean factor of 3.29><, for 73% of the
gene families, and RANGER—DTL—U performed better, by a mean fac—
tor of 1.28><, on very large gene families (indeed, most of the re—
maining 27% of the gene families where RANGER—DTL—U was faster
contained more than 800 genes). We refer the reader to the
Supplementary Material for a precise comparison.

4 Conclusion

ecceTERA supports a comprehensive set of reconciliation models, for
which parsimonious reconciliations are computed using an efficient
implementation of a unified dynamic programming algorithm.
Moreover, it offers additional features that were not available in a sin—
gle software, such as species—tree aware gene tree reconstruction and
the computation of all parsimonious reconciliations. Future exten—
sions will include the reconciliation of rooted non—binary gene trees
(manuscript in preparation, partial support for this feature is provided
in the current release), the sampling of optimal and suboptimal recon—
ciliation scenarios, and provide a model of incomplete lineage sorting
(ILS) (Chan et al., in preparation), in the spirit of Stolzer et al. (2012).

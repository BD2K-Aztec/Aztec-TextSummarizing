Abstract

Motivation: Understanding the interactions of different DNA binding proteins is a crucial first step
toward deciphering gene regulatory mechanism. With advances of high—throughput sequencing
technology such as ChlP—seq, the genome—wide binding sites of many proteins have been profiled
under different biological contexts. It is of great interest to quantify the spatial correlations of the
binding sites, such as their overlaps, to provide information for the interactions of proteins.
Analyses of the overlapping patterns of binding sites have been widely performed, mostly based
on ad hoc methods. Due to the heterogeneity and the tremendous size of the genome, such meth—
ods often lead to biased even erroneous results.

Results: In this work, we discover a Simpson’s paradox phenomenon in assessing the genome—
wide spatial correlation of protein binding sites. Leveraging information from publicly available
data, we propose a testing procedure for evaluating the significance of overlapping from a pair of
proteins, which accounts for background artifacts and genome heterogeneity. Real data analyses
demonstrate that the proposed method provide more biologically meaningful results.

1 Introduction

Understanding the regulatory mechanism of gene expression is an
important goal in functional genomics research. It is wider believed
that the regulation of transcriptional process involves the combin-
atory controls of different regulation including protein bindings, his-
tone modification and DNA methylation (Brivanlou and Darnell,
2002; Jaenisch and Bird, 2003; Mitchell and Tjian, 1989). DNA-
binding proteins such as transcription factors (TFs) bind to the DNA
and thereby either activate or repress the expressions of nearby
genes. There are extensive interactions and cooperations among dif-
ferent DNA-binding proteins in order to provide precise gene ex-
pression regulation (Cheng et (11., 2012). The interactions among
proteins can often be inferred from exploring the spatial correlation
of their binding sites. For example, if the binding sites of two

proteins significantly overlap, it is very likely that they interact in
some manner. Thus, exploring the spatial correlation of binding
sites is an important first step toward understanding the interaction
of proteins.

The genome-wide profiling of protein binding sites has become
an easy procedure, thanks to the rapid advances of high-throughput
sequencing technologies such as ChIP-seq (Johnson et (11., 2007).
With the continuous reduction of sequencing cost, it has become a
common task for a scientist to map the binding sites of a few pro-
teins under biological conditions of interest, and then compare them
with each other or with public data. These results provide informa-
tion for potential interactions and co-bindings of the proteins. Tasks
like this require methods to assess and quantify the spatial correl-
ations of binding sites.

Spatial correlations of protein binding sites

1767

 

Given the binding sites (in the form of genomic regions) of two
proteins, it is often of interest to know whether the binding sites sig—
nificantly overlap. A straightforward approach is to perform statis—
tical test based on a 2 X 2 table. To do so, one would segment the
genome into small bins (such as a few hundred base paris), and use a
binary vector to represent the presence/absence of binding for a pro—
tein. Then the co—occurrence pattern of the two binding sites can be
represented by a 2 X 2 table. The statistical significance of the over—
laps can be assessed using Pearson’s x2 test or Fisher’s exact test, and
the overlaps can be visualized by a Venn Diagrams (Chen et al., 2008;
Khushi et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2010). Unfortunately, such an ap—
proach is strongly influenced by the heterogeneity and tremendous
size of the genome (details provided in next section). As a result, al—
most all pair—wise comparisons give significant results. Although con—
straining analysis to a smaller subset of the genomic regions can
reduce the overall genome size and decrease the genome heterogeneity
to certain degree implicitly (Garber et al., 2012), simple procedures
such as Fisher’s exact tests targeting at limited regions still lack sys—
tematic treatment of the genome heterogeneity and fails to account
for the background artifacts. Approaches based on distance metrics
(Chikina and Troyanskaya, 2012; Favorov et al., 2012) have also
been proposed to measure the similarity of two lists of genomic re—
gions. These approaches, however, don’t consider the genome hetero—
geneity, thus also suffering from inﬂated significance.

Considering the genome heterogeneity, Bickel et al. (2010) de—
veloped a subsampling randomization test procedure and a software
package Genome Structure Correction (GSC) to assess the overlaps
between two region lists. The method assumes that the genome is
block stationary, and the overlapping ratios are different in each
block. The genome segmentation is estimated from data using a
dyadic segmentation approach. However, the segmentation com—
pletely depends on the overlapping of the two given lists of regions
and thus could provide unstable results. Moreover, the validity of
GSC relies on the assumption that the ratio of the number of seg—
ments and the total length of the genome goes to zero. That requires
the length of each stationary block to be very large, thus the genome
segmentation is rather coarse, and the adjustment of genome hetero—
geneity is insufficient. Additional works on analyzing relationships
of genomic regions are available, for example, using multivariate
hidden Markov model (HMM) to characterize the combinatory his—
tone patterns across the genome (Ernst and Kellis, 2012; Ernst et al.,
2011), or assessing the reproducibility of two replicates for a single
TF using a copula mixture model (Li et al., 2011). These methods,
however, are not directly applicable in assessing the strength of cor—
relation of two lists of binding sites.

In this work, taking advantage of the rich collection of public
data, we systematically investigate the pairwise overlapping of many
protein binding sites. We discover through extensive real data ana—
lyses that many seemingly significant overlaps of binding sites are
actually results of phenomena in a similar flavor as the Simpson’s
paradox. We therefore propose a new method to adjust for genome
heterogeneity and correct the experimental biases. Real data ana—
lyses demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional
association tests in determining statistical significance as well as pro—
viding more biological relevant ranking.

2 Methods

2.1 Data exploration
We obtained the binding sites (peaks called from ChIP—seq data) of
36 proteins in K562 and GM12878, the two most extensively

studied cell lines in the ENCODE project (Consortium et al., 2004).
Here we focus on the overlapping patterns of proteins in K562.
Results for GM12878 are presented in the supplementary materials,
which are shown to have similar patterns.

To evaluate the overlapping of a pair of proteins, we first seg—
ment the whole genome into bins of 1000 base pairs (bp). For a pro—
tein, each bin is annotated as 0 or 1 according to the absence or
presence of its binding peaks. Then for a pair of proteins, a 2 X 2
contingency table in the format of Table 1 is constructed to present
the co—occurrence pattern of binding sites. Under this setting, assess—
ing overlapping can be formulated as testing whether the presence of
binding sites over the genomic bins for the two TFs are independent,
which can be achieved by a x2 test. Unfortunately, the x2 test claims
significance for 627 out of the total 630 pairs of TFs for K562 at sig—
nificance level of 0.05 (594 out of 595 pairs for GM12878). In the
2 X 2 table, under independence assumption, the expected value of
overlaps C22 is E[C22] :  Figure 1 shows the observed C22
versus E[C22] for all pairs of TFs: the observed are systematically
greater than the expected overlaps, which leads to the significance
results of almost all x2 tests.

The patterns showed in Figure 1 clearly demonstrate that a
straightforward x2 test provides inflated test statistics and exagger—
ates the significance of correlation, because it is implausible that all
pairs of proteins have significant interactions. We carefully examine
the data, and discover that the phenomena are mainly caused by
three data artifacts. The first artifact is the heterogeneity of the gen—
ome. If one examines the correlations at different subsets of the
whole genome, two lists of binding sites could be independent at all
subsets but correlated marginally. We will provide more in—depth
explanation of this point in next section. The second one is the ex—
perimental artifact. Some regions tend to have reads clustered and
thus easier to be called as peaks. Peaks at these regions artificially in—
crease the overlapping ratio. Thirdly, the sheer size of the genome
can turn a tiny effect into statistical significance. Due to the large N,
a slight deviation from the balance point of the 2 X 2 table will result
in a tiny P—value, which gives practitioners a wrong impression of
TF association strength.

With the understanding of these artifacts, we sought to design a
novel method to overcome the biases and provide more accurate
results.

2.2 A Simpson's paradox in binding site correlation
Below we provide an in—depth explanation of the effect of genome
heterogeneity on the overlapping analysis. Consider the following
hypothetical toy example. Suppose the genome consists of two types
of segments with 1000 bins and 100 000 bins, respectively. Two lists
of binding sites appear independently in each type of bins (the cor—
responding 2 >< 2 tables are shown in Table 2). Even though the
binding sites are completely independent in both types of bins, the
marginal table over the whole genome gives significant x2 test results
with an extremely small P—value (P < 2.2e — 16).

This phenomenon is similar to the well known Simpson’s para-
dox in statistics, and is prevalent in genome—wide association studies
(GWAS) and recent epigenome—wide association studies (EWAS).

In (RX/AS, the disease status can be independent of the genetic
markers within each subpopulation. However, collectively for a het-
erogeneous sampling population, spurious associations between dis-
ease and makers arise when the population structure is not
considered (Marchini et al., 2004; Price et al., 2006). In FAX/AS, cell-
type composition additionally confounds the relationship between
epigenetic makers and diseases (Zou et al., 2014). \We suspect that
similar phenomenon exists in protein binding sites. If one considers
the genome heterogeneity and separates the genome into different
segments, two lists of proteins binding sites could appear rather in-
dependently in each segment, and yet they correlate marginally.

To verify our hypothesis, we segment the whole genome according
to the ChromHMM results (Ernst and Kellis, 2012). ChromHMM
implements a multivariate hidden Markov model, based on histone
modification status, to segment the genome into 15 different states.
\We obtained the genome segmentations for K562 and GM12878
from ENCODE, and constructed a 2 x 2 table for each type of gen-
ome segments. Then in genome segment type 5 (s : l.  . 15), (332
and its expected value ElCil] were calculated. Figure 2 plots (333 ver-
sus ElCil] for all pairs of proteins in all 15 genome segments.
Comparing Figure 2 with Figure 1, it is clear that the discrepancies be-
tween observed and expected overlaps are much smaller. The discrep-
ancies are very small in the three types of promoter regions, as the
dots are almost on the diagonal lines. The discrepancies still exist in
other regions, albeit in a much smaller scale. Thus, we conclude that
the genome segmentation does alleviate the discrepancies between
observed and expected overlaps compared to on the whole-genome
scale. These figures also reveal that there is a heavy left ‘tail’ in the
lower end at some segments, especially the longer ones such as the re-
pressed regions and heterochromatins. These tails are likely to be

caused by the technical artifacts, that is, some regions tend to have
reads clustered and be called as peaks. \With these understandings, we
design a method to correct the background overlaps and propose a
statistical testing procedure to more objectively assess the significance

of overlaps between the binding sites of a pair of proteins.

2.3 Model the overlaps
\We propose the following method to correct the background over-
laps of two lists of protein binding sites. The method is based on an
assumption that a majority of the protein pairs don’t interact. This
assumption implies that ideally (after proper correction), the dots in
Figure 2 should be around the diagonal lines in all segments. Similar
assumption has been the foundation for many different types of dif-
ferential analysis since early gene expression microarray days, e.g. a
majority of the genes are not differentially expressed (Anders and
Huber, 2010; Smyth, 2005; Wu et al., 2013). Various methods de-
signed for calling differential protein binding are also based on the
assumption that a majority of the binding sites don’t change (Chen
et 51]., 2015; Shao et 51]., 2012). Under this assumption, we design
the following method.

To simplify notations, we denote Oil by Y,,, representing the

observed overlaps for the 2‘?" pair of TFs in genome segment type 5.

Spatial correlations of protein binding sites

1769

 

We further denote the expected overlaps computed from the 2 X 2
table, under independence assumption that two proteins don’t inter-
act, by X,,. As mentioned, E[Y5,] aé X5), so one observes discrepan-
cies shown in Figure 2. Our goal is to estimate the ‘true’ expected
overlaps under independence, denoted as #5,, and then construct a
statistical test for independence of two lists of binding sites. We
use the following model for ,u,,, which is assumed to be a function
of X511

 :  + exprrrlogxar. <1)

The model is motivated by the real data observation in Figure 2.
Here 5, is a small constant representing the ‘baseline’ overlap for
genome segment type 5. It means that when X,, is very small (liter-
ally no expected overlaps between two lists of binding sites), one still
observes some overlaps due to technical artifacts. This constant is
used to account for the heavy left tail observed in some regions as
shown in Figure 2. When X5, is large, 5, becomes negligible. 
characterizes the relationship between ,u,, and X,, on the logarithm
scale. The model parameters are c, and  for each 5. When the esti-
mates for these parameters are available, ,u,, can be estimated given
logX,,-, and then a test statistics can be computed.

We adopt the following procedure to estimate the parameters,
based on the assumption that most pairs have no interaction. 5, is
estimated from pairs of proteins with small X5,. Specifically, let it be
the cutoff for the set of small X,,, and A, : {i : X5, < t} be the result-
ing set. Then, 5, is estimated as the average observed overlaps in set
A,: 85 : Zia; Yg/(AJ. By default, we use if: 1 in real data analysis.
In practice, we find the choice of it does not affect the final result
much. Meanwhile,  is estimated by locally weighted scatter plot
smoothing (lowess) (Cleveland et al., 1992) for pairs with reasonably
large X,,:  : [Du/655(10ng ~ logX,,-) for i g A5. With the estimates,
we plug in to obtain the estimates for #5,: [(5, : E, + exp{f5 (logX,,-)}.

We applied the procedure to the K562 and GM12878 data.
Figure 3 shows the observed (Y5,) versus corrected expected overlaps
([15,) from K562 data. Similar figure for GM12878 is shown as
Supplemental Figure S1. As expected, the dots are now scattered
around the diagonal lines, indicating that most pairs of proteins
don’t interact, so that there is no discrepancies between observed
and expected overlaps.

2.4 Testing procedure

With [(5, available, we use the following testing procedure to assess
the overlaps. Denote the total number of bins for segment type 5 as
N,, we assume that the observed overlap Y,, for the i”) pair of pro-
teins in segment 5 follows a Binomial distribution of Bin(N5.p5,-). [7,,
is the probability of observing overlaps in segment 5, and is esti-
mated as ﬁs, :[15,/N5. Then based on the normal approximation to
the Binomial distribution, the test statistic in segment 5 can be calcu-
lated as:

 

t: : —‘. 2
M N5p5[(1 ’ [251) ( )

This procedure provides one test statistic for each genome seg-
ment. We examine the distribution of these test statistics, and pro-
vide a Q—Q plot of its, against standard normal distribution in
Supplementary Figures 52 and S3. The figures show that its, follow
normal distribution reasonably well in each segment.

To assess the overall association between a pair of proteins, one
wants to aggregate the statistics from all segments and come up with
a single score. We define the aggregated score, for the i”) pair of pro-
tein, as T,- : :5  Technically, if its, follow independent normal

distributions, T, should follow a z2 distribution under null. However,
results show that T, does not follow a 7}, partly because of the correl-
ations among its, for different 5. We use the following procedure to em-
pirically generate the null distribution of T,. We assume that no (or
very few) pair of proteins ‘repel’ each other. In other word, the bind-
ing sites of proteins do not exclude, or the observed overlaps usually
are not significantly lower than expected. Under this assumption, the
left parts of its, represent the null distributions for each segment type.
This can be empirically seen from Supplementary Figures 52 and 53,
where the left tails of the distributions in all segments are much lighter
than the right tail. Then for each segment type 5, we randomly
sampled No items from {2%,- : t5,- < O} with replacement. Denote the
sample by f:/).j : 1. - - - .No, we compute Tm : :5 (ii/DZ, and use its
empirical distribution as the null distribution for T,. For the it!) protein
pair, the P-value for the overall association can be calculated as

mt“) > n).

3 Results

We first look at the distribution of the test statistics and p—values
from K562 data. Figure 4(a) shows the Q—Q plot of T, versus T0).
The lower part of the T, distribution follows the null very well. The
heavy tail in the upper part represents the protein pairs that exhibit
significant overlaps. Overall, the background correlation with the
statistical test procedures provide reasonable results. Figure 4(b)
> T,), which
behave reasonably well with a spike close to 0 and the rest approxi—

shows the histogram of the resulting P—values P(T(l)

mately following a uniform distribution. Finally, we turn P—values
into q—values, the minimum false discovery rate to call a test signifi—
cant (Storey, 2003), to control for multiple comparison.

We further assess the binding site correlations for proteins from
K562 and GM12878 cell lines. In all analyses, we set the cutoff t for
choosing small XS, as 1, and the number of random samples to con—
struct the empirical null distribution NO as 10 000. We apply the
above procedure to all pairs of proteins to assess their spatial correl—
ations. Here, we discuss the results for several important proteins.

We first look at MYC (c—Myc), which is an important TF in cell
cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. We calcu—
late the correlations of MYC with all the other proteins with data
available from ENCODE using different methods, including our
proposed method and the traditional Pearson’s x2 test. We also in—
tended to compare our results with GSC. Unfortunately, GSC is un—
available from ENCODE anymore, thus the comparison cannot be
performed. Table 3 provides results for all proteins, where the pro—
teins are ranked based on their association strengths with c—Myc.
The rankings are based on x2 test statistics and the proposed T, stat—
istics, respectively.

First, results from x2 test indicate that all proteins are signifi—
cantly overlapped with c—Myc (x2 P—values are not provided since
they are all very small). From the proposed method, however, only 7
proteins show significant overlap with c—Myc. We believe that the
proposed method provides more meaningful results since it is more
plausible that only a few instead of all proteins interact with c—Myc.
We further look at the rankings of the proteins, which provide im—
portant information for the degree of interactions. From x2 test,
Hey1 is the top rank TF. However from our proposed method, it
only ranks at the 11th with q—value 0.14, becoming insignificant.
On the other hand, the top rank TF by our proposed method is Max
(Myc Associated factor X), which is well known to interact with
c—Myc (Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991). Figure 3 highlights the
Hey1—c—Myc and Max—c—Myc pairs (in red and blue dots respect—
ively) in the scatterplots. It can be seen clearly that Max has substan—
tial deviations from the adjusted expected overlaps in most segment

types. In contrast, Hey1 is much closer to the adjusted expected
overlaps under the independence null assumption. These demon—
strate that it is more reasonable that Max has stronger correlation
with c—Myc. The figures also show that the most significant correl—
ations between Max and c—Myc happen at poised promoters and
various enhancer regions.

We further explore the results for c—Fos. Results are provided in
Supplementary Table 51. Again, x2 test indicates that all proteins
are significantly overlapping c—Fos, whereas the number of signifi—
cant proteins is 11 from the proposed method. Looking at the rank
of the proteins, P012, c—Myc and Hey1 are ranked among the top 10
from x2 test. From the proposed method, they rank 14, 21 and 22 re—
spectively, and none of them is significant. All four proteins (c—Fos,
Pol2, c—Myc and Hey1) heavily bind to the promoter regions, thus
their overlaps are significant on the genome—wide scale. However,
our results indicate that there’s no statistical evidence that these pro—
teins have interaction or co—binding. We conduct literature reviews
on these proteins. Even though there are reports on the co—appear—
ance on these proteins, no conclusive evidence has been shown for
their interactions. Furthermore, we look at the results for CT CF, an
insulator—binding protein (Supplementary Table 52). The proposed
method indicate that only Rad21 and an263 show significant

overlaps with CTCF. Rad21 is well known to co—bind with CTCF.
From x2 test, proteins like c—Myc, Hey1 and P012 are shown very
significant overlaps with CTCF. They are, however, ranked rather
low from the proposed method.

In addition, we explore the IRF4 protein from GM12878 cell
line. IRF4 belongs to the IRF family and is well known for combina—
torially collaborations with other TFs (Garber et al., 2012; Li et al.,
2012). From Supplementary Table S3, we can see that 9 TFs over—
laps with IRF4 at false discovery rate of 5%. In particular, the pro—
posed method ranks JUND rather high (at the third place) compared
to the x2 test (at the 10th place), and JUND is recognized as a crucial
factor for IRF4—mediated transcription (Li et 41., 2012). Once again,
the proposed method offers more biologically plausible results.

Moreover, we investigate the robustness of the proposed method
to the number of TFs used to train the model for artifacts and gen—
ome heterogeneity correction. We take the K562 data, randomly
sample a subset of the 36 TFs, and use these TFs to fit the model for
correcting artifacts and genome heterogeneity. Based on the esti—
mated model, we then evaluate correlation strengths for the sub—
sampled TFs as well as for all 36 TFs. We repeat such procedure for
10, 20 and 30 TFs. We find that even with only 20 TFs, the results
are very similar to the one from using all 36 TFs (comparing
Supplementary Figures 54—59 to Figure 3, the observed versus cor—
rected expected number of overlapped binding sites), and the test
statistics t,,’s in each segment behave well according to Q—Q plot
(Supplementary Figs 510—512). The ranking of TFs in terms of asso—
ciation with c—Myc by our proposed method based on 20 and 30
TFs are provided in Supplementary Tables S4 and SS, which are
very similar to the ones from using all 36 TFs. Nevertheless, when
the number of training TFs drops to 10, the estimation of P—values
becomes unstable, even though the relative ranking of TFs remains
similar to the ones from using more TFs (Supplementary Tables
S6).These results demonstrate that our proposed method will work
properly even with a reasonable number of TFs. On the other hand,
we acknowledge that more training TFs is always preferred for lev—
eraging additional information to better model the background arti—
facts. For real application, we recommend including at least 20 TFs
into the database so that in total around 200 TF pairs will be used
to train the model. The rapid accumulation of ChIP—seq experiments
in the public repositories will help enhance the power of the pro—
posed method.

Among the ChromHMM segmentation, some regions such as
heterochromatin are known to be less informative for assessing TF
binding because the peaks in such regions are more likely to be arti—
facts. To investigate this, we reanalyze the data by excluding the het—
erochromatin. However, results are almost identical and the ranks
of TFs are exactly the same. This indicates that including the less in—
formative regions would not have much impact on the final result,
thus we recommend keeping all ChromHMM segment types in ana—
lysis to avoid any subjective selection of genomic regions.

Overall, by controlling for genome heterogeneity and correcting
for background artifacts, the new testing procedure allows more ac—
curate assessment of the real interaction and collaborative binding
patterns of proteins. Compared with traditional method such as x2
test, our results are improved in two aspects. First, it provides a bet—
ter ranking for the association strength with a certain protein. We
acknowledge, however, that without gold standard (the true ranking
of association strengths), it is very difficult to comprehensively
evaluate and compare the performance of ranking. Nevertheless, the
ranks from our proposed method agree with the prior biological
knowledge better overall. Secondly, the proposed method provides
statistical significance is more biologically plausible. This will be

particularly important in experiments where only a few proteins are
profiled and their relationships are evaluated, and the scientists
really care if the proteins have ‘significant’ interaction. Traditional
methods provide statistically significant results (tiny P—values) for al—
most all pairs of proteins, which is not plausible. In this case the
ability to draw better statistical inference from our proposed method
will be especially helpful.

4 Discussion

In this work, we focus on assessing the significance of binding sites
overlaps. Existing methods mostly fail to consider the genome het—
erogeneity and experimental artifacts, thus over—estimating the cor—
relations and exaggerate the statistical significance. By carefully
exploring the real data, we discover a Simpson’s paradox phenom—
enon in the genome—wide overlapping patterns of protein binding
sites, and we show that the genome heterogeneity plays an import—
ant role in the seemingly significant results from the traditional
methods. We propose a new method to correct for genome hetero—
geneity and background overlaps, and then develop a statistical test
procedure by leveraging information from historical data in large
public data repository. Real data analysis shows that the proposed
method provides more statistically meaningful and biologically in—
terpretable results.

We want to emphasize that the idea of considering genome het—
erogeneity in assessing TFBS correlation is not completely absent in
literature. The essence of the proposed method is similar to the one
proposed in (Bickel et al., 2010) and implemented in GSC, that is,
the genome is assumed to be block stationary and the correlations
need to be evaluated at different segments of the genome. The differ—
ence is that GSC relies on the binding sites of a pair of proteins to
perform genome segmentation, whereas our proposed method util—
ize the genome segmentation provided by ChromHMM. The
ChromHMM segmentation leverages information from other data
(histone modification ChIP—seq) and provide finer, more biological
meaningful segments. These results subsequently improve the infer—
ence in assessing binding sites overlaps.

Note that our method depends on the availability of
ChromHMM segmentation, which is not always available. A very
recent paper ChromImpute (Ernst and Kellis, 2015) supplements
ChromHMM by offering an approach to impute epigenomic data
and providing genome segmentation based on the imputed data. We
believe this method will provide a meaningful segmentation as long
as there are some epigenomic data available for a given sample. For
biological samples without any available epigenomic data, we rec—
ommend segmenting the genome based on other existing data such
as genome annotations. The genome can at least be separated into
promoter/exonic/intronic/intergenic regions. Other annotations like
CpG island and repetitive regions can also be used for better seg—
mentation. Interactions among different regions can be introduced
as well. For example, promoter regions can be separated into GC—
rich and GC—poor promoters. We believe that finer segmentation
and more genomically homogeneous segments will provide better re—
sults in assessing protein binding interaction. Another important
point is that the data used for genome segmentation must be inde—
pendent of the protein binding data, so that the confounding can be
eliminated. Our software package provides an option for users to
provide their own genome segments.

The proposed method operates on the peaks detected from ChIP—
seq data, and the raw read counts data are not considered. We be—
lieve the correlations in the presence/absence of peaks will be more

robust than the correlations in read count level, which is prone to
technical artifacts. One concern is that different ChIP—seq peak caller
could potentially affect the correlation results. However, we use a
rather large window size (1000 bp) to define overlaps and expect the
results to be robust against the choice of ChIP—seq peak callers.
Using a relatively larger window size will also include the ‘closeness’
relationship, because peaks spatially close to each other but not
exactly overlapping could fall into the same bin and be counted as
overlap.

The method proposed here is specifically designed for measuring
the overlaps of short peaks. For longer peaks, or ‘blocks’ such as the
peaks detected from H3K9me3 histone modification data, the
method might not be directly applicable. The method can potentially
be applied to assess the spatial correlation of other short genomic
features, such as euchromatin island (Wen et al., 2012) or DNase I
hypersensitive site (Crawford et al., 2006). To comprehensively re—
assess the spatially correlation of different genomic features is our
research plan in the near future.

The assumption of pairwise independence of most pairs of pro—
teins is the fundamental of the proposed method. However ‘most’ is
a rather loose term, and we believe as long as more than half of the
pairs are independent, the method will work well. Even if the as—
sumption is violated, the final result will be on the conservative side
(under—estimate the significance), which is more desirable than
overly optimistic (over—estimate the significance). Moreover, with
the exponential growth of next generation sequencing datasets and
their publicly availability, the null distribution can be updated and
improved with inclusion of new data.

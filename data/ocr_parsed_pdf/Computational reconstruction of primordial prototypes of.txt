ABSTRACT

Motivation: Enzymes are complex catalytic machines, which
perform sequences of elementary chemical transformations resulting
in biochemical function. The building blocks of enzymes, elementary
functional loops (EFLs), possess distinct functional signatures and
provide catalytic and binding amino acids to the enzyme’s active
sites. The goal of this work is to obtain primordial prototypes of EFLs
that existed before the formation of enzymatic domains and served
as their building blocks.

Results: We developed a computational strategy for reconstructing
ancient prototypes of EFLs based on the comparison of sequence
segments on the proteomic scale, which goes beyond detection of
conserved functional motifs in homologous proteins. We illustrate
the procedure by a CxxC-containing prototype with a very basic
and ancient elementary function of metal/metal-containing cofactor
binding and redox activity. Acquiring the prototypes of EFLs is
necessary for revealing how the original set of protein folds with
enzymatic functions emerged in predomain evolution.

1 INTRODUCTION

Current evolution of proteins takes place via mutation and
recombination of protein domains, leading to both divergence and
convergence. It is rather obvious, however, that evolution of protein
structure and function did not start from full protein folds (Iwasaki,
2010; Koonin, 2003), and the latter has to have been formed in a
predomain stage of evolution. Therefore, one of the most important
tasks in studies of the evolution of protein function is to ﬁnd how
the ﬁrst set of folds with the most basic biochemical functions was
formed and to determine the set of ancient functional peptides that
gave rise to the above repertoire of folds (Berezovsky et al., 2003a, b;
Trifonov et al., 2001).

Previous studies have demonstrated that closed loops of 25—30
amino acid residues are universal building blocks of protein folds
(Berezovsky, 2003; Berezovsky and Trifonov, 2001; Berezovsky
et al., 2000). According to the same studies, the closed loops

emerged from ring-like peptides, primitive proteins or protein-
like molecules in prebiotic evolution, and served as building
blocks of the ﬁrst protein folds. Similarly to folds that are built
from closed loops as structural units, the enzymatic functions can
also be decomposed into combinations of elementary units of
protein function. The latter are closed loops that possess one or
a few ﬁinctional residues and bring them to the active site (de
Gennes, 1990), which we call Elementary Functional Loops (EFLs;
Goncearenco and Berezovsky, 2010). The functional signatures
of some EFLs are shared between (super)families of proteins
with different biochemical functions and even between different
folds. Their prototypes presumably underwent recombination at the
predomain stage of protein evolution. Recently, we have developed
a computational procedure for ﬁnding sequence proﬁles of widely
spread EFLs with characteristic functional signatures (Goncearenco
and Berezovsky, 2010). In this procedure, we obtained sequence
proﬁles from complete proteomes. Many of the proﬁles correspond
to their originating protein families [such as those described in
PFAM (Bateman et al., 2004) or CDD (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2005)]
and represent family-speciﬁc functional signatures [as in Prosite,
(Sigrist et al., 2010)], while others reveal connections between
different folds and functions. Here, we would like to proceed further
and ﬁnd a way to obtain ancient prototypes of EFLs. Therefore, we
developed a procedure for reconstructing prototypes, which served
as basic units of the ﬁrst folds/domains with enzymatic functions.

The procedure for obtaining prototypes is very different to that of
ancestor reconstruction. The latter typically requires a phylogenetic
tree built from the alignment of related (super)famin members
and an evolutionary model with particular mutation and amino
acid substitution rates (Cai et (11., 2004; Harms and Thornton,
2010; Mirkin et al., 2003). Here, on the contrary, we work with
short sequence fragments belonging to phylogenetically unrelated
proteins from remote (super)families, which presumably were
involved in the design of the ﬁrst enzymes in predomain evolution
(Trifonov et al., 2001).

We illustrate the computational strategy that we have developed
by reconstructing an ancient prototype with redox-active/metal-
binding elementary function. The most generic signature of this
prototype reads Cys-Xaa-Xaa—Cys (-CXXC- for brevity). We start
with a minimal set of non-redundant proﬁles from which we
reconstruct the prototype and its derivatives. Using these proﬁles in
a proﬁle-sequence search over complete proteomes and the protein
databank, we detect a diversity of EFLs with metal/metal-containing
cofactor binding and redox activity in different folds and show that
they take part in different biochemical functions.

Reconstruction of prototypes of elementary functional loops

 

2 METHODS

Procedure for obtaining ana1 charactering proﬁles of EFLs: we introduce
here a computational procedure for reconstructing the most ancient and
generic prototypes of EFLs. Previous studies were mostly focused on
detecting conserved functional motifs among homologous proteins with
known functions. The distinctive feature of our method is that no preliminary
assumptions about the homology or function are made. and prototypes are
reconstructed from the comparison of all sequence segments on a proteomic
scale. First. we cut several proteomes into initial 50-residue long segments
(size of closed loop 25730 residues plus 10-residue ﬂanks) (Berezovsky et al..
2000). iteratively compare them to non-redundant proteomic sequences.
and thus obtain sequence proﬁles represented as position-speciﬁc scoring
matrices (PSSM) [for details see (Goncearenco and Berezovsky. 2010)].
Some of the obtained sequence proﬁles have clear functional signatures and
correspond to EFLS from various non-homologous proteins. We reconstruct
prototypes from proﬁles that have similar functional signatures using
clustering procedure described below.

In order to characterize the proﬁles and their elementary functions
we identiﬁed the corresponding EFLS in enzymatic domains with known
biochemical function and structure by performing a proﬁle-sequence search
in the CDD database (Marchler-Bauer et al.. 2005). In some cases it was
possible to annotate the elementary function of individual residues in a
proﬁle’s signature by analyzing the CDD annotation on the domain level.
in other cases we used databases such as IBIS (Shoemaker et al.. 2010).
MACiE (Holliday et al.. 2009). Prosite (Sigrist et al.. 2010) and PDBeMotif
(Golovin and Henrick. 2008).

Sequence proﬁle clustering procedure: pairwise proﬁle comparison and
clustering have 0(N2) complexity and memory requirements (Murtagh.
1984). Thus. processing of 104 — 105 sequence proﬁles becomes unfeasible
without a speciﬁcally developed method. We implemented aparallel program
for pairwise comparison and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method
with Arithmetic Mean) clustering (Sokal. 1958) of the initial set of proﬁles.
Based on the properties of the distance matrix we introduced a heuristic.
which allowed speeding the computation up signiﬁcantly. In particular.
identiﬁcation of disconnected components in the distance matrix (above a
certain proﬁleiproﬁle distance threshold) splits a large unclustered dataset
into several smaller sets that can be clustered independently. The program
source code in C using MP1 is available on request.

Overlap-basea1 proﬁle—proﬁle comparison: proﬁles a and b with sets of
matches A and B overlap if they match the same protein (same Gene Id) and
positions of the matches are not further than 20 residues apart from each
other. The distance between proﬁles is calculated using the Jaccard distance
(Lipkus. 1999) J(a,b) = 1 — |A ﬂBl/lA UBl. assuming that the intersection is
the number of overlapping matches. and the union is the total number of
unique matches in both proﬁles. If J :0. then all the matches of proﬁles
overlap; if J = 1. then proﬁles do not have any overlapping matches.

PSSM-basea1 comparison of proﬁles: the distance between two proﬁles
is calculated by comparing their PSSMs. In order to account for possible
proﬁleiproﬁle alignments. we calculate superpositions of PSSMs with
maximal offset :l:20 and compare the corresponding 30-residue windows.
The distance between the windows is calculated as the Euclidean distance
between aligned PSSM positions weighted by the total information gain
(KullbackiLeibler divergence. DKL) of amino acid frequencies in the aligned
positions relative to the average proteomic frequencies of amino acids
(Kullback and Leibler. 1951). From all possible superpositions of two
proﬁles. the one giving the minimal distance between 3-residue windows
a and b is used. The pairwise distance reads:

d=Z(DKt(ai>+Dmbi>)Hat—bill.

Benchmark preparation: sequences of 40 archaeal proteomes
(Supplementary Table ST1) were compared using BLASTP (Altschul
et al.. 1990) (E-value 50.0001) against a non-redundant (up to 40%
pairwise sequence identity) SCOP/ASTRAL database of structural domains.
release 1.75 (Murzin et al.. 1995) in order to identify structural domains

in the proteomes. Homologous domains were identiﬁed in 40% of the
sequences (48 269 domains in 36718 sequences). Redundancy between the
identiﬁed domains has been removed with cd-hit program (Li and Godzik.
2006) down to 70% sequence identity. The benchmark required a set of
superfamilies for which the coverage could be robustly measured. Therefore.
we selected 150 SCOP superfamilies (TOP150) that were represented by
more than 50 non-redundant domains in our dataset. The fold census of the
TOP150 set is shown in Supplementary Figure $1.

3 RESULTS

The goal of this work is to obtain prototypes of elementary functions
and their derivatives. We deﬁne a prototype as the most generic
and ancient functional signature, and its derivatives as descendants
(EFLs) with a diversity of contemporary functions. We develop
a special benchmark for sequence search with proﬁles of EFLs,
introduce and evaluate a new PSSM-based measure for proﬁle-
proﬁle comparison, and reconstruct prototypes by clustering the
proﬁles. As a case study, we explore a prototype with -CxxC-
containing signature and its derivatives.

3.1 Sequence proﬁle search benchmark

The functional diversity of a prototype can be estimated by the
number of SCOP superfamilies found by its associated proﬁles of
EFLs (assuming that the superfamilies themselves are unrelated).
Since it is important to select out random hits from real matches to
superfamilies we need a way to estimate the sensitivity (detection
power) of a proﬁle in the sequence search. A true match to
a superfamily can be asserted by a sufﬁcient coverage of the
superfamily by sequence search. As in any sequence—sequence
or proﬁle—sequence search, we resort to the E-value parameter
to control the number of expected false positives. We need to
determine the minimal E-value, which gives the maximal number
of true positive hits. Already existing benchmarks can only be
used for evaluating the sequence—sequence and sequence—proﬁle
search on the level of whole proteins or domains, and not on the
level of short sequence fragments. Therefore, we were prompted
here to create the TOP150 benchmark, which we use to show
that E-value calculated in our procedure is a correct estimate of
the expected number of false positives. Figure 1A shows that our
search procedure provides a clear separation between true and
false hits by a plateau phase as ﬁrnction of E-value. The plateau
widens with increasing coverage from 0% (black line) to 70%
(green line), resulting in only true hits in superfamilies with high
coverage (above 50%, yellow line). As a result, by controlling the
coverage we obtain the number of ‘true’ superfamilies corresponding
to the prototype. This level is indicated by an arrow in Figure 1A,
showing where the red, blue and yellow plateaus are aligned. In
the routine search, where coverage is not controlled (black line),
the minimal E-value can be determined as the level at which the
number of covered superfamilies reaches an already determined
‘true superfamily plateau’. Correspondingly, the end of the plateau
on the black line designates the maximal E-value. The interval
between the plateau on the black line and the one on red/blue lines
(few hits) determines the false positive rate expected in the search
with no control of coverage. At lower E -values (E < 0.0005) several
hits will be missed as ‘false negatives’. At higher E-values (E > 1)
false positive rate will increase exponentially (see the black line in
the ﬁgure). The TOP150 benchmark helps to determine the optimal

number of TOP150 superfamilies found with a certain level of coverage (color lines). The plateau phase observed at high coverage (shown with an arrow)
indicates the number of ‘true positive” superfamilies. The corresponding range of E-values (0.0005 <E < 1. shown between the vertical dashed lines) gives
a realistic estimate of number of observed false positives. The interval between the plateau on the black line and the one on red/blue lines (a few hits)

range of E -values for proﬁle—sequence search. We show that E -value
provides a correct estimate of the number of false positives, and the
benchmark can be used to determine the optimal range of E-values
for proﬁle—sequence search.

We also show here how to select a group of related derivatives
from the complete set of proﬁles and how to reconstruct the
prototype. In order to do that it is necessary to compare proﬁles
with each other, supposing that the most similar proﬁles will be
derivatives of the same prototype. The natural way to compare
proﬁles would be to compare their matches. However, this
comparison depends on the number of matches and may not correctly
reﬂect the similarity between proﬁles in the case of low sequence
coverage. An alternative way to compare proﬁles is to compare the
PSSMs representing them. The advantage of this comparison is that
it is independent of the coverage. However, it is necessary to ﬁnd
out how well matrix comparison reﬂects the match-based similarity
between proﬁles, and to determine the range of proﬁle—proﬁle
distances where the matrix comparison is applicable. Here, in order
to evaluate the performance of the PSSM-based distance measure,
we compare it with the overlap-based measure (see Methods).
Figure 1B shows that PSSM-based distance (d) correlates well (R2 =
0.7) with the overlap-based distance (J) in the range of distances
d <20 and J <0.8. We use the distribution of pairwise distances
between reshufﬂed proﬁles to estimate statistical signiﬁcance of
proﬁle—proﬁle distances (Supplementary Figure S2). Figure 1C
shows that pairs of proﬁles with statistically signiﬁcant similarities
are observed in a narrow distance range below PSSM-based distance
d = 10, where conﬁdence level is 0.016.

3.2 Reconstruction of the -CXXC- prototype

We illustrate the computational strategy of prototype reconstruction
with an example of a prototype with a very simple -CxxC- signature
(two cysteines separated by two other residues). We reconstructed
this prototype from a set of 11 derivatives, which we found to be
related by proﬁle clustering. These proﬁles formed a group with

low proﬁle—proﬁle pairwise distances (in Supplementary Figure S2
the green line shows the density plot for pairwise distances in
this group). Unrelated derivatives, as well as reshufﬂed proﬁles,
have higher pairwise distances between them. We analyzed the
representatives of the -CxxC- prototype, found by its derivatives
in annotated protein domain families (Marchler—Bauer et al., 2005;
Shoemaker et al., 2010), and concluded that the prototype has
elementary functions of metal/metal-containing cofactor binding
and redox activity.

Figure 2 shows the -CxxC- prototype (logo in the center), its
11 derivatives (red diamonds), and the CDD superfamilies (blue
and green ovals) where representatives of the prototype and the
derivatives (corresponding to EFLs) were found. CDD superfamilies
with unknown ﬁrnction (corresponding to PFAM DUFs) were
excluded from the Figure 2 for clarity. However, matches found in
these superfamilies can be considered as predictions of elementary
functions (listed in Supplementary Table ST2). Superfarnilies,
where more than one derivative has matches, are placed in
the central circle. Most of the derivatives also have speciﬁc
sets of superfamilies, which are shown in the outer circle. The
speciﬁcity of these superfamilies is determined by the peculiarities
of their signatures and the corresponding elementary functions.
For instance, Derivative 1 matches medium chain reductase/zinc-
dependent alcohol hydrogenase (MDR) where the corresponding
EFL has a unique signature -CxxCxxCxxGx(4)C- and is responsible
for binding of zinc ions (Figure 2f). Another example is one
of the matches of Derivative 4 in Cytochrome C, where the
speciﬁc ﬁrnctional signature —CxxCH- binds a heme (Figure 2a).
The signature of copper binding -GM[TH]CXXC- represented by
Derivative 8 is found in heavy metal-associated domains (HMA,
Figure 2j). It is important to note that the speciﬁcity of one derivative
prevents ﬁnding the matching EFLs by other derivatives. Also,
it is impossible to ﬁnd all related EFLs by the very prototype
with -CxxC- signature. Even in a search with high E-values,
the prototype is unable to detect the whole diversity of EFLs.

Fig. 2. The -CxxC- prototype (logo in the center), its derivatives (red diamonds), and their hits in CDD superfamilies (ovals and structures). The color
of the ovals represents whether the superfamily is found by the prototype (green) or if it can only be found by the prototype’s derivative (blue). E-value
threshold of proﬁle-sequence search is 1 for the derivatives and 145 for the prototype. The inner circle represents superfamilies containing matches from
several derivatives. The structural fragments are shown with arrows pointing to the corresponding CDD superfamily, and are taken from the following
proteins: (a) Cytochrome C553 with bound heme (PDB 1c75); (b) Archaeal translation factor Aif2beta which is a C4 zinc ﬁnger (PDB 1nee); (c) Thioredoxin
from Protein disulﬁde oxidoreductases Thioredoxin superfamin (PDB 2trx); (d) Isoleucyl-tRna Synthetase from Nucleotidyl transferase superfamily (PDB

from Medium chain reductase/dehydrogenase superfamin (PDB 1e3e); (g) MoaA molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein from the S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM)-dependent radical enzyme superfamily (PDB 1tv8); (h) Large gamma subunit of Initiation Factor Eif2 from Ras-like GTPase superfamin which
includes GTP translation factors (PDB 1kk3); (i) domain from a Ferredoxin-Cytochrome complex belonging to Fer4 [4Fe-4S] binding domain (PDB 1dwl_A);
(j) PDB 1k0v, copper-transport CopZ protein domain from heavy-metal-associated domain superfamin (HMA). The bound cofactors are shown in colored
spheres or sticks: magenta spheres, zinc ions; orange, copper ion; green sphere, iron ions; green sticks, [4Fe—4S] clusters; magenta sticks, heme C. Disulﬁde
bond is shown in orange sticks in structure (c). (Asterisk) Rad50_zn_hook superfamily is not listed in the CDD release 2.25, and it was amended to the graph
because it brings a new structural example (see Fig. 3). The graph was visualized with Cytoscape 2.8.1 (Shannon et al., 2003) and protein structures 7 with
PyMol 1.3 (DeLano Scientiﬁc).

Blue ovals in Figure 2 show superfamilies where the prototype
has no matches with E-value threshold 145. Green ovals show
superfamilies where EFLs are detected by the prototype at this
threshold. Notably, the inner circle is almost completely green,

whereas the outer one contains mostly the speciﬁc superfamilies
missed by the prototype. In general, even though all derivatives
possess the -CxxC- signature, they differ in the other positions
contributing to the information content of their proﬁles (logos in

Supplementary Table ST3). Derivatives with a higher number of
informative positions have representatives in fewer superfamilies
(see the third column in Table ST3). More generic signatures
(closer to that of the prototype) always have fewer informative
positions. For example, Derivative 3, whose signature has less
than 8 informative positions (-CP[KRE]CG[GSA]x[LMV]-), is the
derivative with the maximal number of superfarnily matches. Thus,
the prototype describes a very generic elementary function, but it
looses the detection power for ﬁnding its representatives. The set of
derivatives, in turn, complements the prototype allowing one to ﬁnd
representative EFLs in contemporary proteins.

In order to identify and characterize the elementary function of the
prototype -CxxC- we explore the diversity of roles of the conserved
cysteines in different biochemical contexts via the derivatives of
the prototype and via the corresponding EFLs. The short motif with
two cysteine residues separated by two other residues can be found
in a variety of proteins and its ﬁrnction is well-studied (Chivers
et al., 1996, 1997; Fomenko and Gladyshev, 2003; Quan et al.,
2007). Early studies were mostly centered around the redox ﬁrnction
performed by the CxxC signature. The focus on the redox role was
achieved in two different ways: via sequence analysis of complete
genomes and by selection of pairs of proteins with alternate redox
states from the protein databank. In the ﬁrst case, Gladyshev and
colleagues derived a collection of sequences containing CxxS, SxxC,
CxxT and TxxC motifs, avoiding motifs involved in metal binding.
Furthermore, they analyzed occurrence, conservation and function-
related modiﬁcations of the CxxC motif and its variants in proteins
of thioredoxin fold (thioredoxins, glutaredoxins, protein disulﬁde
isomerases and nucleoredoxins) (Fomenko and Gladyshev, 2003).
Fan et al. (2009), on the contrary, scanned the protein databank,
searching for redox-active Cys—Cys pairs. They described four
major classes of structural changes between alternate redox states:
disulﬁde oxidation following expulsion of metal; reorganization
of polypeptide backbone; order/disorder transition; and changes
in quaternary structure. They proposed that the above changes
are associated with physiologically relevant redox activity. The
results obtained by Gladyshev and colleagues and Fan et al.
have important functional and evolutional implications, but are
limited to redox function and obtained from, and applicable to,
redox-related functional (super)families. Our goal is to reconstruct
prototypes of EFLs, which are not restricted by conserved ﬁrnctional
motifs in homologous proteins. Therefore, we derive the prototypes
on a proteomic scale without any preliminary assumptions about
sequence/structure homology or similarity of the function. As a
result, we obtained the most generic prototype, which describes
all redox functions along with metal and metal-containing cofactor
binding ones. By analyzing EFLs representing the prototype in
different biochemical functions and connections between remote
functions, we unraveled long evolutionary history hidden in the
signatures of the CxxC prototype and its derivatives. We show below
that metal/metal-containing cofactor binding and redox elementary
functions are intimately connected, and the -CxxC—containing
prototype is their common evolutionary root.

3.2.1 Metal and metal-containing cofactor binding The
cysteines in the -CxxC- signature often interact with metal ions
(typically zinc and iron, but also other metals) and metal-containing
cofactors, such as heme and [Fe-S] clusters. Metals and metal-
containing cofactors, in turn, can assist biochemical reactions.

The cysteine residues in -CxxC- and additional residues such as
methionine, as in the case of Derivative 8 and HMA, can also
bind other metals, such as copper, cadmium and cobalt. One of
the important biological functions implied by metal and metal-
containing cofactor binding EFLs is detoxiﬁcation of heavy metals
by binding and transferring them in metal chaperones. A special
structural role of cysteine-coordinated metals is revealed in zinc
ﬁngers (Figure 2b, d and e) where the metal (not necessarily
a zinc ion) stabilizes the minimalistic fold. Many zinc ﬁnger-
containing proteins are also involved in catalysis as DNA- or RNA-
affecting enzymes (polymerases, isomerases, primases, nucleotidyl
transferases). For example, the topoisomerase-primase (TOPRIM)
superfarnily (Derivatives 3 and 5 in Figure 2) contains an ATP-
dependent reverse gyrase. Some of the derivatives also bind
metal-containing cofactors, such as iron—sulfur cluster, which is a
key electron carrier in central metabolic and energetic pathways
(Johnson et al., 2005). The cluster has different potentials in different
conﬁgurations, such as [Fe-S], [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S]
(Meyer, 2008). Ferredoxin (Fer4) is a very compact and short
[4Fe-4S] binding domain. It has less than 60 amino acid residues,
and is structurally composed of three closed loops. Binding of
iron-sulfur clusters by ferredoxins (as exempliﬁed by the EFL
structures in Figure 3g and i) is an ancient and essential function
(Dupont et al., 2010). Another cofactor, which is typically bound by
EFLs with the -CxxC- ﬁrnctional signature, is heme. For instance,
Heme C is covalently connected to cysteines in Cytochrome C553
(Derivative 4, Figure 3a), which are port of a -CxxCH- signature.
The functionally important histidine, which is part of the signature,
coordinates the iron in the heme.

3.2.2 Redox chemistry of the -CxxC- signature The -CxxC-
containing EFLs are able to perform redox chemistry without any
cofactors, as exempliﬁed by thioredoxins (Figure 2c). Depending on
the biochemical context, the role of the disulﬁde/dithiol in -CxxC-
can be different. For example, members of the Thioredoxin-like
superfarnily contains redox active dithiols/disulﬁde bond within
the -CxxC- motif. Redox-active dithiols in thioredoxins (derivative
10, structure c in Figure 2) play a protective role as antioxidants.
For example, oxidation of cysteine residues that bind zinc in
transcription factors can have deleterious implications for gene
expression (Wilcox et al., 2001). Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin
with -CxxC- signature have potential functions as facilitators and
regulators of protein folding and chaperone activity. They bind
unfolded proteins and act as chaperones and isomerases of disulﬁdes
to generate a native fold (Berndt et al., 2008). The differences in
redox properties of Thioredoxin proteins are attributed to variation
of the -CxxC- motif (Atkinson and Babbitt, 2009; Fomenko and
Gladyshev, 2003). Besides, the -CxxC- prototype (as shown in logo
in the center of Figure 3) contains more than just two cysteines.
The proline and glycine (in the CPxCG signature) can play an
important structural role, providing the conformation necessary for

Fig. 3. Connections between remote biochemical functions established Via
relations between the prototype. its derivatives and their representative
EFLS in CDD superfamilies. Black arrows represent the hits between
derivatives (shown with sequence logo) and superfamilies (ovals) found
by the proﬁle-sequence search. Dashed green lines show hits of the very
prototype (green ovals). Superfamilies detected only by the derivatives. but
not by the prototype are shown as blue ovals. The elementary functions
of derivatives are: 1. binding of zinc ion by two cysteine residues; 4.
binding of zinc ion by four cysteines; 10. contains two redox active cysteine
residues. Examples of CDD superfamilies include: eIF-5_eIF-2B. translation
initiation factor IF2B/IF5 (PDB 1nee); SIR2. silent information regulator 2
(PDB lici); zf-DHHC. DHHC zinc ﬁnger domain; MDR. medium chain
reductase/dehydrogenase and zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase-like
superfarnily (PDB 2eih); Thioredoxin_like. a superfarnily characterized
by Thioredoxin fold and including disulﬁde oxidoreductases and protein
disulﬁde isomerases (PDB 2trx); Hpr. superfamily of enzymes required for
maturation of hydrogenases (PDB 2zld). Structural examples of the enzymes
and the corresponding EFLS are shown in Supplementary Figures S3759.

derivative. Derivative 4 is responsible for zinc ion coordination
provided by its pair of -CxxC- signatures, and the EFLs of this
derivative work in different biochemical functions. For example,
this zinc ﬁnger is important for correct recognition of the AUG
codon in translation initiation factor eIF-5_eIF-2B, as well as in
transcription factors, where it is responsible for recognition of
sequence-speciﬁc double-stranded nucleic acids (Gutierrez et al.,
2004). An example of another biochemical ﬁrnction is SIR2
superfamily, where zinc ion coordination provided by the EFL of
derivative 4 contributes to creating and maintaining the substrate-
binding site. The biochemical ﬁrnction of the SIR2 family is NAD-
dependent protein deacetylation, which is involved in transcriptional
silencing, X-chromosome silencing and suppression of ribosomal
DNA recombination (Min et al., 2001). Derivative 1 corresponds
to EFLs coordinating structural zinc ion. In case of the MDR
superfamily, which includes alcohol dehydrogenases, this loop
supports quaternary structure of metalloenzymes. A similar role
of zinc ion coordination is performed by this loop in zf—DHHD
domain. Although, the biochemical functions of proteins containing
the zf—DHHD domain are not completely understood, the zinc-
coordinating loop presumably assists protein—protein and protein—
DNA interactions (Putilina et al., 1999). Derivative 10 describes

EFLs with two redox-active cysteines, which can form a disulﬁde
bond or be reduced to dithiol. The Thioredoxin superfarnily
represents a large group of proteins with diverse redox biochemical
functions. All the enzymes in this superfamin are characterized by
a small Thioredoxin fold with a redox active -CxxC- signature. The
elementary ﬁrnction of the -CxxC- containing loop in connected
Hpr superfarnily is similar to the one in thioredoxin reductases, but
the biochemical ﬁrnction of Hpr is much more complex (Watanabe
et al., 2007). Enzymes in the Hpr superfamin are involved in
maturation of [NiFe] hydrogenases—a multi-step process, which
includes insertion and cyanilation of the iron center. The cyanilation
is provided by the EFL of Derivative 10, in which a -CxxC- disulﬁde
bond should be preliminarily reduced.

3.2.4 Role of EFLs of -CxxC- prototype in diﬁ’erent biochemical
functions Figure 4 exempliﬁes how EFLs of the CxxC prototype
(blue) contribute to different biochemical functions together with
other EFLs. Cytochrome C553 (Figure 4A) is an example of one
of the simplest membrane-bound electron-transfer proteins, which
is presumably involved in respiratory metabolism, and consists
of two EFLs only (Benini et al., 2000). Cysteines in the loop
containing the -CxxCH- signature (blue) are covalently bound to
heme, whereas histidine in this signature is one of the two axial
ligands to the heme Fe atom. The second loop provides another
axial ligand (methionine), forming the entire fold together with the
EFL of Derivative 4.

Methyltransferase rRNA modiﬁcation enzyme leN (Figure 4B)
belongs to a diverse superfamily of Radical SAM enzymes, which
includes more than 3000 members and is characterized by the
presence of an iron—sulﬁrr cluster and s-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
(Frey et al., 2008). SAM is bound to one of the Fe atoms in
the cluster. The [4Fe-4S] cluster, in turn, is ligated by three
cysteine residues forming a characteristic -CxxxCxxC- signature
(represented by Derivatives 6 and 11). Methyltransferase function
also involves methylation of a cysteine residue (Boal et al., 2011),
which is provided by another typically unstructured loop (the
modeled loop is shown in red color in Figure 4B).

Figure 4C contains a remarkable example of the complex
biochemical ﬁrnction of DNA recombination and repair. First, the
-CxxC- containing loop (blue) performs a structural ﬁrnction of zinc
ion coordination in the coiled-coil zinc hook (Hopfner et al., 2002),
where it assists dimerization. Secondly, Rad50-ATPase domains
together with Mre11 domains located at the coiled-coil termini
perform the very DNA processing (recombination and repair) driven
by ATP hydrolysis (Hopfner et al., 2001). Rad50-ATPase is an
example of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC), consisting of EFLs
with characteristic Walker-A (red) and Walker-B (green) signatures.
It is important to note, however, that contrary to the typical ATP
binding cassettes of membrane-bound ABC transporters, the Rad50-
ATPase is a complex domain formed from two subunits located on
different alpha-helices of the coiled coil linker. This observation
emphasizes the role of EFLs as independent elementary units of
protein function, showing how EFLs can be used in simple domains
[formed by the continuous polypeptide chain, as in membrane-bound
ABC transporters (Davidson et al., 2008)], as well as in the complex
domains exempliﬁed here (Rad50-ATPase).

Figure 4D contains an example of the function performed at the
interface in the two-domain protein, involving -CxxC- containing
(blue), FAD-binding (red) and NADPH-binding (green) EFLs.

Rad50-ATPase/Coiled-coil domain working DNA recombination and repair (Derivative 3. Rad50_zn_hook in Figure 2). Parts of the heterotetrameric DNA
processing head and a double coiled-coil linker are shown (PDB 118d and 1ii8. see also Supplementary Figures S10. $11 for the whole structures). Each
CxxC-containing EFL (blue) contributes two cysteines coordinating the zinc ion. In addition. Rad50-ATP contains EFLS characteristic for ABC domains with
typical Walker A (red) and Walker B (green) signatures; (D) Thioredoxin reductase (Derivative 10. Thioredoxin_like superfamily in Figures 2 and 3. PDB
ltdf) consists of two domains and involves two redox active catalytic cysteines as part of the EFL with CxxC signature (blue). along with EFLS of NADP+

binding (green) and FAD binding (red).

This thioredoxin reductase disrupts disulﬁde bonds in its substrate
thioredoxin (Waksman et al., 1994). In the conformation shown in
Figure 4D, the disulﬁde of -CxxC- containing elementary ﬁrnctional
loop stacks against the isoalloxazine ring system of FAD and is
reduced at the expense of oxidized FAD. Next, rotation between
domains takes place, and as a result, the nicotinarnide ring of
NADPH is brought in close contact to FAD, hydride is transferred
between the two dinucleotides, and NADPH reduces FAD. At
the same time, the redox active dithiol of the -CxxC- containing
elementary functional loop is on the surface of the protein and is
accessible to the substrate (thioredoxin).

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a computational strategy for reconstructing
the most ancient prototypes of elementary functions and their
derivatives, allowing one to establish evolutionary relations between
a prototype and its descendants in contemporary proteins. The
key steps of this strategy are: (i) obtaining a non-redundant set
of sequence proﬁles with signatures of elementary functions; (ii)
ﬁnding a set of derivatives of a prototype; (iii) reconstructing a
generalized prototype with the most generic elementary function;
and (iv) analyzing and showing relations between the prototype, its
derivatives and their descendants in modern folds and functions.
This computational approach allows one to tackle the problem of

hidden evolutionary relations between different folds and remote
biochemical functions. The above strategy is exempliﬁed here by
the -CxxC- prototype of the EFLs with metal/metal-containing
cofactor binding and redox activities, represented in more than 90
superfamilies. We go beyond the analysis of ﬁrnctional conservation
in homologous proteins by dividing the enzymes into units of
elementary functions. Figure 4 contains examples of proteins where
EFLs of -CxxC- prototype occur. In these proteins elementary
functions of the prototype work together with other elementary
functions resulting in different biochemical transformations such
as radical SAM-dependent methyl transfer, thioredoxin reductase,
and ATP-dependent nuclease in a DNA double-strand break repair
complex. Figure 4 illustrates how one can study predomain evolution
of proteins applying the strategy developed in this work. Ultimately,
we would like to obtain the set of ancient prototypes of elementary
functions and to determine the set of ﬁrst enzymes emerged as a
result of their recombination in predomain evolution.

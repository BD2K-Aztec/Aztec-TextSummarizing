through NMA, allowing fast large—scale (potentially genome—
wide) analyses. The method developed previously (Panjkovich
and Daura, 2012) is now implemented as a web server working
as follows: (i) initially, the user uploads a protein—structure file
(PDB format) and selects which chains and ligands should be
considered for the calculations. Alternatively, the user may
submit a protein sequence and the server will attempt to generate
a structural model by homology to known structural templates
(Eswar et al, 2008). (ii) Once the job is submitted, the LIGSITE“
program (Huang and Schroeder, 2006) is used to predict putative
ligand—binding sites, where a simpliﬁed representation of a small
molecule (i.e. a set of dummy atoms forming an octahedron) will
be placed to simulate the presence of a ligand. (iii) NMA is
carried out for the apo (unbound) structure. (iv) For each po—
tential ligand—binding site, an NMA is executed for the proteini
ligand complex using a simpliﬁed ligand representation; if a
cocrystallized ligand is selected, the calculation will be performed
for the corresponding binding site. (v) If a signiﬁcant difference is
found between the NMA—derived B—factors of the apo and
ligand—bound states of the protein (WilcoxoniManniWhitney’s
P g 0.05), the binding site is marked as potentially allosteric.

Complementarily, if enough structural data are available for
the protein family, the structural conservation of each pocket is
also measured. We have previously shown that allosteric sites
tend to be structurally conserved within a protein family
(Panjkovich and Daura, 2010) and that the incorporation of
this measure improves the capacity of the method based on dy—
namics to correctly identify allosteric sites (Panjkovich and
Daura, 2012). Immediately after submission the user is provided
with a link where results can be accessed once the calculation has
ﬁnished. Optionally, the user can choose to be notiﬁed by email
when results are available.

A standard run on a 500—residue protein will take ~3 min.
Even though calculation times increase exponentially with the
number of residues, larger systems can be processed within rea—
sonable time (e.g. 1000 residuesz 12 min). The results are de—
livered as a ranking and, if the browser allows it, the binding sites
can be explored online on the 3D protein structure by means of
the Jmol package (http://www.jmol.org/). To complement the
analysis, active site residues are predicted and reported on the
structure using a previously described methodology (Mistry
et al, 2007). Binding sites and ligands are color coded according
to given thresholds for the level of structural conservation
(3 50%) and the predicted effect on protein dynamics
(P3005). The protein structure ﬁle including the position of
identified sites, a visualization script and a table with calculated
values can be downloaded as well for further processing. Normal
modes and derived B—factors can be explored in detail using spe—
ciflcally designed interfaces that are available at the results web
page. A more detailed description of the server and its param—
eters is provided as Supplementary Material and available as
online documentation on the website.

Predicting allosteric sites computationally is not trivial, and to
illustrate the success rate that the user can expect, we have bench—
marked PARS using 102 allosteric proteins. Brieﬂy, the results
show that if we consider all predicted cavities matching an allo—
steric site in the benchmark set, 44% appear in the first position

and 18% on the second position of the PARS ranking, whereas a
total of 73% are found in the top three positions. Full bench—
mark details and performance statistics are available as
Supplementary Material.

We expect that this easy—to—use and relatively fast web server
will prove useful for medicinal chemists and other researchers
studying the regulation of protein function for biochemical char—
acterization and other applied tasks such as binding—site priori—
tization for virtual drug screening.

Genomic Similarity Score

DNA Signature Distance

Fig. 1. Same-species clustering. Most of the same-species strains have GSSs >0.90 and DNA signature distances <0.25. GSSI, concentrates most of the
same-species strains above the 0.9 score, and GSSC spreads them the most. DNA signatures produce the best clusters, as shown by agglomerative/divisive

coefﬁcients, with divisive clustering producing slightly better clusters

Instead of the selfScores of proteins ﬁnding RBH, we calculated
the total sum of selfScores of all proteins in the genome of ref—
erence. This has the effect of producing a smaller GSS. Again,
the ﬁnal GSSC was the average from the perspective of both
genomes under analysis.

We also clustered our genomes by di—, tri— and tetra—nucleotide
DNA signatures with Manhattan distances (Campbell et al.,
1999).

To build groups of redundant genomes, we used a hierarchical
clustering method (Hastie et al., 2009). We used 1— G55 to
construct a dissimilarity matrix to run the clustering algorithms.

All computations were carried out using R (R Development
Core Team, 2012). The commands agnes and (liana in the cluster
package were used to run the two main strategies in hierarchical
clustering: agglomerative or bottoms—up and divisive or
top—down, respectively.

To assess the clustering structures, we used the agglomerative/
divisive coefﬁcients deﬁned as 1 minus the average ratio of
dissimilarity of one unit to the cluster it first merges with, to
the dissimilarity of its merging in the final step of the algorithm.
A coefﬁcient close to 0 means that the algorithm did not find a
natural cluster structure (the data consist of a single cluster),
whereas a coefﬁcient close to 1 means that clear clusters have
been identified.

GSS‘, and G55}, concentrate strains sharing species names (1103
strains in 224 species) into the 0.94.0 range of the G55 distri—
bution, whereas GSSC spreads several of them between the 0.7
and 0.9 range (Fig. 1). Thus, GSSC might be the least adequate
for clustering redundant genomes. Because DNA signatures are
faster to calculate than GSSS, we are starting to experiment with
DNA signatures for our work in comparative genomics. Thus,
we have also clustered our genome dataset based on di—, tri— and
tetra—nucleotide signature distances. DNA signature distances
among same—species strains concentrate at <0.03.

The divisive coefﬁcients were higher, and thus better, than the
agglomerative coefficients using all three GSSs and DNA

signature distances (Fig. l). The coefﬁcients using GSSC were
the lowest among all three GSSs for both algorithms, thus con—
firming that GSSC is the least adequate for clustering genomes.
However, DNA signature distances produced the best overall
clusters, with divisive coefficients >0.95.

The appropriate threshold for deﬁning groups of redundant
genomes depends on the application (e.g. Moreno—Hagelsieb
and Janga, 2008). Thus, we recommend experimenting with
different thresholds. The Web site provides 10 thresholds per
measure that should sufﬁce for such experimentation. Should
other users prefer to experiment at thresholds other than those
provided through the Web site, we also provide the R scripts
used to derive these groups, and the pertinent distance/similarity
data. With some effort, inexperienced users would be able to
modify these scripts to obtain groups at other thresholds.
Finally, we also provide cluster ﬁles that can be read by software
for drawing and manipulating phylogenetic trees (Newick
format).

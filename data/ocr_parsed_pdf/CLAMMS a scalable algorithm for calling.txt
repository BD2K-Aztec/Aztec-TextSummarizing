Abstract

Motivation: Several algorithms exist for detecting copy number variants (CNVs) from human
exome sequencing read depth, but previous tools have not been well suited for large population
studies on the order of tens or hundreds of thousands of exomes. Their limitations include being
difficult to integrate into automated variant—calling pipelines and being ill—suited for detecting com—
mon variants. To address these issues, we developed a new algorithm—Copy number estimation
using Lattice—Aligned Mixture Models (CLAMMS)—which is highly scalable and suitable for detect—
ing CNVs across the whole allele frequency spectrum.

Results: In this note, we summarize the methods and intended use—case of CLAMMS, compare it to
previous algorithms and briefly describe results of validation experiments. We evaluate the adher—
ence of CNV calls from CLAMMS and four other algorithms to Mendelian inheritance patterns on a
pedigree; we compare calls from CLAMMS and other algorithms to calls from SNP genotyping
arrays for a set of 3164 samples; and we use TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction to val—
idate CNVs predicted by CLAMMS at 39 loci (95% of rare variants validate; across 19 common vari—
ant loci, the mean precision and recall are 99% and 94%, respectively). In the Supplementary
Materials (available at the CLAMMS Github repository), we present our methods and validation re—
sults in greater detail.

Detecting copy number variants (CNVs) with whole exome sequenc-
ing data is challenging because CNV breakpoints are likely to fall
outside of the exome. Almost all CNV-calling algorithms for whole
exome sequencing base their calls on read depths within the CNV,
which are linearly correlated to copy number state. Previously pub-
lished algorithms include CoNIFER (Krumm et (11., 2012), XHMM

CANOES (Backenroth et (11., 2014).

Depth-of-coverage is subject to both systematic biases (often
related to sequence GC-content) and stochastic volatility (which is
exacerbated by variation in input DNA quality). CNV callers must
normalize coverage data to correct for systematic biases and charac-
terize the expected coverage profile given diploid copy number, so

Finally, we used TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction to
validate a random subset of CNVs predicted by CLAMMS at 20 rare
variant loci and 19 common variant loci that overlap disease—associated
genes in the Human Gene Mutation Database (not limited to genes
associated with CNVs; 7430 disease genes in total; Stenson et al.,
2012); 19/20 (95%) rare variants were validated. At the common vari—
ant loci, CLAMMS genotypes achieved mean precision/recall values of
99.0% and 94.0%, respectively. ExomeDepth also had near—perfect
performance for mid—frequency CNVs but had inaccurate genotypes at
highly polymorphic loci (see Supplementary Table 55).

Abstract

Motivation: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of parent—offspring trios is a powerful approach for
identifying disease—associated genes via detecting copy number variations (CNVs). Existing
approaches, which detect CNVs for each individual in a trio independently, usually yield low—detection
accuracy. Joint modeling approaches leveraging Mendelian transmission within the parent—offspring
trio can be an efficient strategy to improve CNV detection accuracy.

Results: In this study, we developed TrioCNV, a novel approach for jointly detecting CNVs in par—
ent—offspring trios from WGS data. Using negative binomial regression, we modeled the read
depth signal while considering both GC content bias and mappability bias. Moreover, we incorpo—
rated the family relationship and used a hidden Markov model to jointly infer CNVs for three sam—
ples of a parent—offspring trio. Through application to both simulated data and a trio from 1000
Genomes Project, we showed that TrioCNV achieved superior performance than existing
approaches.

Copy number variations (CNVs) are defined as changes in the copy
number (gain or loss) of large genomic segments, which can be
transmitted from parents or arise de novo. CNVs have been shown
to play an important role in human morbidities, including neuro—
psychiatric disorders (Cook and Scherer, 2008; Gilissen et al., 2014;
Levy et al., 2011) and cancers (Beroukhim et al., 2010).

CNVs have been traditionally detected using ﬂuorescent in situ
hybridization, array comparative genomic hybridization and SNP

ing (NGS), especially whole genome sequencing (WGS), has become
extremely powerful in detecting CNVs comprehensively, being able
to identify CNVs that are often missed by array—based assays. On
the other hand, NGS—based approaches present substantial chal—
lenges for CNV calling. They usually work by mapping sequencing
reads to the reference genome and subsequently identifying discord—
ant mapping signatures putatively caused by CNVs. As summarized
in Alkan et al. (2011) and Medvedev et al. (2009), there have been

four main categories of mapping signatures that can be leveraged to
detect CNVs from WGS data: (i) read depth (RD), (ii) paired—end
mapping (PEM), (iii) split read (SR) and (iv) a combination of the
above. In addition, CNVs can be detected by using the de novo as—
sembly approach, which first reconstructs contigs from short
sequencing reads and then compares the assembled contigs with the
reference genome sequence to identify the regions with discordant
copy numbers (Iqbal et al., 2012).

Most existing CNV detection approaches focus on one single sam—
ple (individually) or multiple samples without considering the inter—
sample relatedness (Handsaker et al., 2011; Hormozdiari et al., 2011).
Naturally, when genetic relatedness is known for multiple individuals,
effective utilization of this information could potentially improve CNV
detection accuracy. A common relevant study design with known in—
ter—individual relationships is sequencing parent—offspring trios. Indeed,
the parent—offspring trio design has been shown to be powerful in iden—
tifying disease—associated genetic variants for both common and rare
diseases (Samocha et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015). For trio—based NGS
data, a joint modeling approach leveraging the parent—offspring rela—
tionship can potentially improve detection accuracy for CNVs, as the
same principle has been successfully applied to improve detection ac—
curacy for inherited and de novo single nucleotide variants and
INDELs from NGS data (Chen et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Liu et al.,
2014; Peng et al., 2013; Ramu et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2014) as well as
that for CNVs from SNP array data (Chu et al., 2013; Wang et al.,
2008). Importantly, the joint modeling approach allows for an explicit
identification of de novo mutations that have been increasingly recog—
nized to play critical roles in many human diseases (Malhotra et al.,
2011; Sebat et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2008). To our knowledge,
there have been no approaches for calling CNVs from trio WGS data
in a trio—aware manner. Due to the popularity of trio sequencing in
both research and clinical settings, such a tool is urgently needed.

In this study, we presented TrioCNV to fulfill this purpose. First,
we modeled read depth signal with negative binomial regression to
accommodate over—dispersion and considered GC content and
mappability bias. Second, we leveraged parent—offspring relationship
to apply Mendelian inheritance constraint while allowing for the
rare incidence of de novo events. Third, we used a hidden Markov
model (HMM) by combining the two aforementioned models to
jointly perform CNV segmentation for the trio. We applied
TrioCNV to a simulated trio and a WGS trio from 1000 Genomes
Project (1000GP) to demonstrate its performance and strength over
existing approaches.

2 Methods

2.1 Workflow

The workﬂow of TrioCNV is illustrated in Figure 1. There are three
main steps. The preprocessing step extracts the information needed
for building the model from trio WGS data. The CNV segmentation
step performs raw CNV inference using an HMM. The postprocess—
ing step refines raw segmentation results and outputs final CNV
calls.

2.2 Data preprocessing

We split whole genome into non—overlapping, contiguous windows
with a predefined size (default 200 bp), and then obtained RD, GC
content and mappability score for each window for all three samples
of the trio. RD was computed by counting the number of mapped
reads (a minimum read mapping quality can be specified) that start
within the window. GC content was computed as the fraction of

Fig. 1. The workflow of TrioCNV. TrioCNV takes three BAM files of a trio (one
for each individual), a pedigree file, a reference genome file (FASTA format)
and a mappability file (BigWig format) as input, and generates a tab-delimited
file containing final CNV calls

G+C nucleotides within the window in the reference genome se—
quence. Mappability score was computed as the average of all pos—
itions’ mappability scores within the window. The mappability file
used in this study was obtained from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.
edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/ngncodeMapability/ngncode
CrgMapabilityAlign100mer.bigWig. The k—mer length for the
mappability file is recommended to be approximately equal to the
length of the sequencing reads. Mappability files for different k—mer
lengths can be downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser or calcu—
lated by specific tools (Derrien et al., 2012; Koehler et al., 2011; Lee
and Schatz, 2012).

2.3 HMM for CNV segmentation

We used a HMM to simultaneously segment the three genomes of a
trio into regions of different copy number statuses. A triplet of RD,
GC content and mappability score for each window of the three sam—
ples was used as the input for this step. For each sample, we defined
five discrete copy number states for each window, representing two—
copy deletion, one—copy deletion, normal, one—copy duplication and
multiple—copy duplication, respectively. To jointly model the three
samples, each hidden Markov state was associated with a set of pos—
sible copy number states at the window, for all three samples, result—
ing in a total of 125 possible copy number state combinations as
hidden Markov states.

2.3.1 Emission probability

We interpreted RD as HMM’s emission. Theoretically, RD follows a
Poisson distribution with the mean proportional to the copy number
in the absence of systematic bias. However, the Poisson assumption
fails in real sequencing data due to various biases, among which GC
content and mappability are particularly important (Teo et al., 2012).
There is a nonlinear correlation between RD and GC content, and an
approximately linear correlation between RD and mappability score.
To accommodate over—dispersion and account for both the GC

content and mappability biases, we used the more dispersed negative
binomial regression to model the emission probability distribution, in
a different way from existing negative binomial emission models
(Backenroth et al., 2014; Mccallum and Wang, 2013; Szatkiewicz
et al., 2013). We first grouped all windows into 101 bins (GC : 0, 1,
. . . , 100%) by GC content, and then used the negative binomial re—
gression to model the relationship between RD and mappability score
in each bin (see Equations 1 and 2).

where 0, denotes RD, z, copy number state, g, GC content, m, mapp—
ability score in tth window, uh,- RD’s mean, 09;,- and [3,”- the regression
coefficients and 0,-4- the over—dispersion parameter given copy number
i in the jth GC bin.

We estimated the parameters for each GC bin of a sample separ—
ately. Since presumably only a small portion of an individual human
genome harbors CNVs, most windows for a given sample should have
the normal state. After removing windows with outlier RDs, those win—
dows containing CNVs or strong noises were very likely to have been
excluded, and the remaining windows can be used to estimate all un—
known parameters at the normal state. In this step, GC bins with ex—
tremely low (i.e. <0.3) or high (i.e. >0.7) GC content were ignored,
because these GC bins having extremely variable RDs can affect accur—
acy of parameter estimation. In addition, we ignored those GC bins
with insufficient data, which similarly can have an adverse effect.
Finally, we used the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the
R package MASS to estimate the unknown parameters «24-, [32”; and
024-; then #2,,- can be solved from «24-, [32,,- and mt.

After estimating the unknown parameters at normal state, the
unknown parameters for the other four copy number states can be
calculated according to the parameters of the normal state, as shown
in Equations (3) and (4), where 8 is a tuning parameter (8 is set to
0.1 in this study).

Thus, given RD, GC content and mappability score at one win—

by Equation (5).

2.3.2 Transition probability

For a trio, we assume that each parent’s copy number state transition
is independent of other two samples (assuming unrelated parents).
Intuitively, adjacent windows are likely to share the same copy num—
ber state. Therefore, for each parent, the copy number state transition

probability was chosen such that a lower probability was assigned to
the transition to a different state and a higher probability to the tran—
sition to itself (i.e. no change). Thus, the copy number state transition
matrix A : (am), AelR5 X 5 from the t — 1th window to the tth window
can be specified as Equation (7). The specification of p is very robust,
and a smaller value can be assigned to p for low—coverage data and a
larger value for high—coverage data.

The offspring’s copy number state either follows Mendelian in—
heritance pattern or, more rarely, is consistent with a de novo event.
We considered four different combinations of inheritance patterns
at two consecutive windows separately (Fig. 2).

If the copy number states at two consecutive windows both follow
Mendelian inheritance pattern, then the offspring’s copy number state
transition depends on the parents’ copy number state transitions. To
model this relationship, we introduced two—marker copy number inher—
itance matrix B : (bygmﬂﬂﬁz), BER5 X 5X5 X 5X5 X 5 proposed in
Wang et a]. (2008), representing the conditional probability of observ—
ing the offspring’ transition from o to 0’ given the father’s transition
from f to f ’ and the mother’s transition from m to m’ . Therefore, the
final transition probability of HMM at tth group of windows can be
calculated as Equation (8).

If the copy number state at one window is consistent with de
novo event and the copy number state at the other window follows
Mendelian inheritance pattern, these two windows are treated inde—
pendently. To model this relationship, we introduced single—marker
inheritance probability matrix C : (aﬁmﬁ), CelRS X 5X5 proposed in
Chu et al. (2013) that extends the one in Wang et al. (2008) by
incorporating an additional parameter representing the probability
of a de novo mutation. This matrix gives conditional probabilities of
the total copy number of the offspring given the total copy numbers
of the father and the mother. Therefore, the final transition prob—
ability of HMM at tth group of windows can be calculated as
Equation (9).

follow Mendelian inheritance pattern, but not all copy number state
transitions are possible to happen between the two, the offspring’s
copy number state transition is independent of the parents’ copy
number state transitions, and the offspring’s transition probability
can be calculated as the parents’. The final transition probability of

2.3.3 CNV segmentation
The reference genome sequence has a lot of gaps (the long sequence
of “N” bases); sequencing reads cannot be mapped to these gapped
regions, generating non—contiguous contigs with mapped reads in
each chromosome. We considered each contig separately and used
HMM Viterbi algorithm to infer the most likely sequence of hidden
Markov sates. In this step, we ignored those windows in GC bins
with extremely low or high GC content and windows with insuffi—
cient data; hence, copy number states of these windows depend on
their adjacent windows. Finally, only windows with at least one
non—normal copy number state were retained and joined together as
output.

2.4 Data postprocessing

The variability of RD at a window arises not only from true CNVs,
GC content bias and mappability bias, but also from other sources
of noise, which can result in miscalls in the raw CNV segmentation
result. A strategy for merging adjacent CNVs with the same or am—
biguous copy number states is required to obtain accurate CNV
calls. We included CNV calls of the trio at one region as a group.
Our CNV merging strategy is illustrated in Figure 3. Before merging,
the two—copy deletion and one—copy deletion states were classified as
a unified deletion state; the one—copy duplication and multiple—copy
duplication states were classified as a unified duplication state. If
two consecutive groups of CNV calls share at least one same kind of
CNVs and the distance between them was less than or equal to a
specified threshold, then these two consecutive groups were merged
into one group. For the merged group, each sample’s copy number
state was determined by the copy number state with the maximum
sum of length in original groups. In addition, since sequencing reads
cannot be confidently mapped to the reference genome in regions
with extremely low mappability scores, CNVs cannot be confidently

distance threshold to determine if two adjacent groups can be merged. In
addition to the distance constraint, if two adjacent groups are merged, they
must share at least one same type of CNV

detected in these regions. Therefore, removing CN V calls in these re—
gions can significantly reduce false positive rate with a slight sacri—
fice in sensitivity.

2.5 Software availability

We developed TrioCNV based on the approaches described above.
TrioCNV was implemented using a combination of Java and R and
available at https://github.com/yongzhuang/TrioCNV.

3 Results

3.1 Simulation data analysis

To evaluate TrioCNV’s performance and compare it with existing
approaches, we simulated WGS data for a hypothetical trio. We first
generated two haploid genome sequences of chromosome 1 for each
parent by randomly sampling non—overlapping CNVs (2200 bp in
size) from the Database of Genomic Variants (MacDonald et al.,
2014), and then used RSVSim (Bartenhagen and Dugas, 2013) to
introduce sampled CNVs into the reference genome sequence.
Duplications have at most three copies. Then two haploid sequences
were paired together to form each parent’s diploid sequence. Having
two parents’ diploid sequences, we generated the offspring’s diploid
sequence by randomly sampling one of the two haploid sequences
from each parent and pairing them together. The numbers of simu—
lated CNVs for father, mother and offspring were 196 (100 dele—
tions and 96 duplications), 190 (97 deletions and 93 duplications)
and 193 (100 deletions and 93 duplications), respectively. For each
individual, we used the ART Illumina read simulator (Huang et al.,
2012) to generate 100—bp paired—end sequencing reads at 40 X cover—
age (20>< coverage for each haploid sequence) with an insert size
from a Gaussian with mean of 400 bp and standard deviation of 40
bp. We used BWA—MEM (Li, 2013) with default parameters to map
all simulated reads to the 1000GP Phase II reference genome.

Since there are no CNV callers for NGS data considering familial
relatedness, we compared TrioCNV with CNVnator (version 0.3)
(Abyzov et al., 2011), an RD—based single—sample CNV caller and
also one of the most sensitive approaches (Mills et al., 2011). We
specified the same window size of 200 bp for both CNVnator and
TrioCNV. For each method, sensitivity was calculated as the num—
ber of true CNVs detected divided by the total number of true
CNVs, and false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated as the number
of false CNVs detected divided by the total number of CNVs de—
tected. We used a 1—bp reciprocal overlap to determine whether two
CNVs are the same or not.

The performance of TrioCNV and CNVnator on the simulated
trio is summarized in Table 1 (see raw results in Supplementary
Table S1). TrioCNV shows a better sensitivity than CNVnator while
maintaining a similar FDR. Figure 4 shows the size distributions of
simulated CNVs that are detected by TrioCNV and CNVnator. For
large CNVs (Z1000 bp), both TrioCNV and CNVnator are very
sensitive, whereas for small CNVs (<1000 bp), TrioCNV is more
sensitive than CNVnator. Overall, both TrioCNV and CNVnator
have lower sensitivities for small CNVs than for large CNVs, in ac—
cordance with the observation that RD—based approaches are more
suitable for detecting large CNVs (Medvedev et al., 2009).

3.2 Real data analysis
To further evaluate the performance and make a comparison, we
ran TrioCNV and CNVnator on a real WGS trio.

In addition, we also ran three other representative CNV callers,
BreakDancer (version 1.4.4) (Chen et al., 2009), Pindel (version 0.2.5)

(Ye et al., 2009) and DELLY (Rausch et al., 2012). BreakDancer is a
PEM—based caller. Pindel is an SR—based caller. DELLY is an integrated
PEM and SR caller. For BreakDancer, we used BreakDancerMax de—
signed for detecting large structural variation. For DELLY, only CNVs
that passed the filter were kept in the output. All three callers were ran
with default parameters. The real dataset is the high coverage (>75 ><)
Illumina Hiseq WGS data of one CEU (Utah residents with ancestry
from northern and western Europe) trio (father NA12891, mother
NA12892 and the female offspring NA12878) from the 1000GP,
sequenced and preprocessed at the Broad Institute (the data can be
downloaded from ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/v011/ftp/technica1/
working/20120117_ceu_trio_b37_decoy/). The alignment (.bam) files
were generated as follows: all reads were aligned to 1000 Genomes
Phase 1] reference genome using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009); PCR du—
plicates were marked using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net);

recalibration of base quality scores and local realignment around
INDEIs were performed using GATK (DePristo et al., 2011). We used
the same reciprocal overlap criterion and the same definitions for sensi—
tivity and FDR as we used for simulation data analysis.

To evaluate sensitivity, we obtained the gold standard call set from
the 1000 Genome Structural Variant discovery study for the offspring
of this trio (NA12878) (Mills et al., 2011). There were 610 autosomal
deletions and 261 autosomal duplications successfully converted from
NCBI36 to NCBI37 using liftOver (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi—bin/
thiftOver). Furthermore, we examined Mendelian inconsistency for
CNVs detected. Because of the extremely low de novo mutation rate,
although true de novo CNVs can be present, most of the Mendelian in—
consistent CNV calls should be false positives. Therefore, Mendelian
inconsistency rate can indicate the overall performance of CNV detec—
tion for a trio, especially in the absence of true CNV call sets. In this

study, we required a Mendelian consistent call be detected in the off—
spring and overlap (1—bp reciprocal) with a CNV of the same copy
number in at least one parent, and all the remaining calls were treated
as Mendelian inconsistent.

The performance of TrioCNV, CNVnator, BreakDancer, Pindel
and DELLY on the 1000GP CEU trio is summarized in Table 2 (see
raw results in Supplementary Table S2). For both deletions and dupli—
cations, TrioCNV achieved the highest sensitivity and at the same time
the lowest Mendelian inconsistency rate. Figure 5a and b shows the
size distributions of CNVs in the gold standard call set that were de—
tected by the five methods. TrioCNV is more sensitive than all other
four methods for large (2200 bp) CNVs. For small (<200 bp) CNVs,
CNVnator is less sensitive than other four approaches, especially for
CNVs smaller than 200 bp. TrioCNV also showed lower sensitivity for
small CNVs than for large CNVs. This can be partially explained by
the default 200 bp window size we have specified for both TrioCNV
and CNVnator, so there would be no windows entirely covered
by CNVs smaller than 200 bp. In other words, under the 200—bp win—
dow size, the RD signal is insufficient for detecting CNVs smaller than

200 bp. Figure 5c and d shows the concordance among CNVs in the
gold standard call set that were detected by the above four approaches.
There is 61.0% (372/610) concordance among deletions detected by
TrioCNV, CNVnator, BreakDancer, Pindel and DELLY and there is
16.9% (44/261) concordance among duplication detected by TrioCNV
and CNVnator. Each approach reports some unique CNVs, and more—
over, 17 deletions cannot be detected by any of approaches and 177
duplications cannot be detected by either TrioCNV or CNVnator.

In addition, we compared the autosomal deletions called by the
above five methods to another two truth sets, one containing 3376 de—
letions and the other 4095 deletions, both used by Layer et al. (2014).
Since these two truth sets contain many small deletions, we specified a
smaller window size (100 bp) for RD—based CNVnator and TrioCNV
to capture small deletions. For the 1—bp reciprocal overlap criterion
used above, the results are summarized in Supplementary Table S4.
TrioCNV achieved the lowest Mendelian inconsistency rate among the
five methods and is consistently more sensitive than CNVnator and
DELLY. Since BreakDancer, Pindel and CNVnator were used to gener—
ate the two truth sets, these truth sets should be both biased toward

Sensitivity was calculated according to the gold standard CNV call set from the sample NA12878. Since all gold standard CNVs are larger than 50 bp in size,
we only kept CNV calls larger than 50 bp for BreakDancer, Pindel and DELLY. BreakDancer cannot detect duplications, and Pindel and DELLY cannot detect
interspersed duplications, so these three methods were ignored when evaluating duplications

these three methods (Layer et al., 2014). This might explain
TrioCNV’s lower sensitivity than BreakDancer and Pindel.
Furthermore, we calculated the sensitivity across different reciprocal
overlap (RO) criteria from 1—bp to 50% (see Supplementary Figs S1
and S2). TrioCNV is more sensitive than CNVnator and DELLY for
some ROs <5 0%, but less sensitive than BreakDancer and Pindel per—
haps due to the biased true sets. Theoretically, RD—based methods usu—
ally define fixed—sized window (from hundreds to thousands of base
pairs), so they can only provide window—sized resolution. In contrast,
SR—based, PEM—based and de novo assembly methods can provide sin—
gle—nucleotide resolution. Consequently, it is understandable that RD—
based methods are less sensitive when large R05 are used for evalu—
ation, especially for small CNVs. Similarly, we calculated the
Mendelian inconsistency rate across different RO criteria from 1—bp to
50% (see Supplementary Fig. S3). Since TrioCNV performs joint seg—
mentation and models the family relationship explicitly, it achieved an
extremely low Mendelian inconsistency rate, while the other four meth—
ods all showed higher error rates.

4 Discussion

In summary, we introduced TrioCNV, a novel approach to jointly
detecting CNVs from WGS data in parent—offspring trios. First, we
modeled read depth by the negative binomial regression to accom—
modate over—dispersion and account for GC content bias and mapp—
ability bias. Second, we incorporated parent—offspring relation—ship
into our model to leverage Mendelian inheritance constraint while
allowing the rare incidence of de novo mutations. Third, we used an
HMM to jointly make CNV segmentation of the parent—offspring
trio. To our knowledge, this is the first CNV detection method de—
veloped specifically to handle trio sequencing data. To evaluate the
performance of TrioCNV and compare it with existing approaches,
we applied TrioCNV to a simulated trio and a sequenced trio from
1000GP. Our results illustrate that TrioCNV achieves a better per—
formance compared with existing approaches in the trio setting.

Our approach may be further enhanced in several ways. For ex—
ample, we only modeled the RD signal for emission probability,
while not all CNVs are assessable by RD. Therefore, other types of
mapping signals such as read pairs and split reads can be incorpo—
rated to detect CNVs that are not easily assessable by RD. Similar to
other RD—based CNV detection methods, TrioCNV reports lower
(i.e. window—based) breakpoint resolution than SR—, PEM— and de
novo assembly—based methods, and these three kinds of signals can
help refine breakpoints. In addition, our approach is now limited to
WGS data, but it can be potentially adapted to support whole
exome sequencing data.

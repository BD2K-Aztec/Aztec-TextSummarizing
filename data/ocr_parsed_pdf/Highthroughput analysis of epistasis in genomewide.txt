ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene—gene interactions (epistasis) are thought to be
important in shaping complex traits, but they have been under-
explored in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) due to the
computational challenge of enumerating billions of single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) combinations. Fast screening tools are needed
to make epistasis analysis routinely available in GWAS.

Results: We present BiForce to support high-throughput analysis of
epistasis in GWAS for either quantitative or binary disease (case—
control) traits. BiForce achieves great computational efficiency by
using memory efficient data structures, Boolean bitwise operations
and multithreaded parallelization. It performs a full pair-wise genome
scan to detect interactions involving SNPs with or without significant
marginal effects using appropriate Bonferroni-corrected significance
thresholds. We show that BiForce is more powerful and significantly
faster than published tools for both binary and quantitative traits in
a series of performance tests on simulated and real datasets. We
demonstrate BiForce in analysing eight metabolic traits in a GWAS
cohort (323 697 SNPs, >4500 individuals) and two disease traits
in another (>340 000 SNPs, >1750 cases and 1500 controls) on a
32-node computing cluster. BiForce completed analyses of the eight
metabolic traits within 1 day, identified nine epistatic pairs of SNPs in
five metabolic traits and 18 SNP pairs in two disease traits. BiForce
can make the analysis of epistasis a routine exercise in GWAS and
thus improve our understanding of the role of epistasis in the genetic
regulation of complex traits.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in
identifying a large number of trait-associated genetic loci (Hindorff
et (11., 2009), but are less successful in identifying much of the
genetic variation (Maher, 2008). Gene—gene interactions (epistasis)

are thought to be a potential source of unexplained genetic variation
(Eichler et (11., 2010; Gibson, 2010; Manolio et (11., 2009; Zuk et (11.,
2012), but they remain largely unexplored in GWAS conducted so
far. A major hurdle for studying epistasis in GWAS is the lack of
widely accepted algorithms that are fast enough to effectively handle
high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and can map
different forms of epistasis while keeping false-positive rates (FPRs)
under control (Wei et (11., 2010). High-throughput tools are needed to
make epistasis analyses routinely available in GWAS and ultimately
improve our understanding of the role of epistasis in the genetic
regulation of complex traits.

Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to develop new tools and
algorithms for epistasis detection in GWAS (Cordell, 2009) using
either deterministic or stochastic methods, such as regression
(Hemani et (11., 2011; Kam-Thong et (11., 2011; Liu et (11., 2011;
Schupbach et (11., 2010; Wan et (11., 2010), machine learning (Cattaert
et (11., 2010; Greene et (11., 2010; Motsinger-Reif et (11., 2010) and
Bayesian-based approaches (Tang et (11., 2009; Zhang and Liu,
2007). Most of these algorithms concern only GWAS for case—
control (binary) disorders and still require substantial computing
time to analyse epistasis in one trait in real GWAS data (Schupbach
et (11., 2010; Yung et (11., 2011). Partial search strategies, based on
biological knowledge (Emily et (11., 2009) or ﬁltering unimportant
SNPs prior to analysis (Kam-Thong et (11., 2011), are adopted in
some studies in order to reduce excessive computing burden but risk
missing some types of variation. Fast but comprehensive methods
to analyse epistasis in GWAS conducted for many complex (i.e.
continuous and quantitative) traits are lacking.

Previously, we showed that high-throughput analysis of epistasis
in quantitative traits in GWAS was feasible using computers with
general purpose graphics processing units (Hemani et (11., 2011).
We also suggested a search algorithm using the information of
pre-identiﬁed loci in a full pair-wise genome scan to increase the
power of detection of epistasis (Lam et (11., 2009; Wei et (11.,
2010), which was applied successfully in recent studies for binary
(Liu et (11., 2011) and complex traits (Wei et (11., 2011). These
ideas are combined in a unique tool, BiForce, to support high-
throughput epistasis analysis for either binary or quantitative traits
on commonly used computer systems. Herein, we describe the
algorithm and essential features of BiForce and compare the
performance of BiForce with that of BOOST (Wan et (11., 2010) in
binary traits and PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007) in quantitative traits
through simulation, both of which perform exhaustive pair-wise

search based on regression-based statistics over commonly used
computer systems as BiForce. We also demonstrate BiForce analysis
of epistasis in real GWAS data, i.e. eight metabolic traits in
the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966) (Sabatti
et (11., 2009) provided by dbGaP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap)
and two disease traits provided by the Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (WTCCC) (https://www.wtccc.org.uk/ccc1/).
It is hoped that with BiForce, the analysis of epistasis in GWAS
will become a routine exercise thus facilitating accumulation of
information on epistasis hence improving our understanding its role
in the genetic regulation of complex traits.

2 METHODS
2.1 BiForce

BiForce is a multi-threaded Java implementation of a combined
search algorithm (Lam et (11., 2009; Wei et (11., 2010) and it can be
used on a single workstation or computer clusters through a friendly
graphical user interface or the command line. It uses contingency
table-based methods to calculate pair-wise SNP interactions, which
makes BiForce applicable to either binary or quantitative traits
(Supplementary Note 1). BiForce can perform full pair-wise genome
scans very rapidly because of three computational achievements:

(i) Bitwise data structures: SNP genotype data are converted into
Boolean bit values and stored in memory-efﬁcient Java BitSet
arrays allowing missing genotypes to be handled easily.

(ii) Boolean bitwise operations: logical operations (e.g. AND)
over the arrays of bit values make the calculation of SNP
interactions (see below) extremely fast.

(iii) Multithread (and/or multi-core) parallelization: this makes ﬁill
pair-wise genome scans feasible on a single workstation and
portable across computer clusters.

The combined search algorithm includes two consecutive genome
scans: single SNP-based genome-wide association tests (i.e.
conventional GWAS) and pair-wise interaction tests of all SNP
combinations. Single SNPs with marginal effects that are genome-
wide signiﬁcant (marginal SNPs) are identiﬁed in the ﬁrst scan
and used to detect interactions involving marginal SNPs (Wei
et (11., 2010). The 5% genome-wide signiﬁcance thresholds are
derived based on the Bonferroni correction for total number of
tests performed. Given N to be the total number of SNPs in a
study with K (K > 0) marginal SNPs being identiﬁed, the thresholds
are P=0.05/N for marginal SNPs, P=0.05/((N—1)><K) for
interactions involving marginal SNPs (because each marginal SNP is
tested against the full genome, and hence the total test is (N — 1) X K)
and P=0.05/(N X (N— 1)/2) for a pair-wise genome scan (Evans
et (11., 2006; Lam et (11., 2009).

Considering a pair of SNPs denoted as SNP1 and SNP2,
the following genetic models are used to detect epistasis where
genotypes of each SNP (i.e. homozygote of the minor allele,
homozygote of the major allele and heterozygote) were ﬁtted as
ﬁxed factors:

Model 1: y = [1 + SNP1 + SNP; + SNP1 >< SNP2 + e

Model 2: y = [1 + SNP1 + SNP; + e,

where y is the trait of interest, [1 is the model constant, SNP1
(or SNP2) is a ﬁxed factor with three levels, SNP1 >< SNP2 is the
interaction term and e is the random error term. The test of Model
1 against Model 2 (F ratio for quantitative traits and log-likelihood
ratio for binary traits) is for the interaction between the two SNPs
(i.e. four degrees of freedom). P-values were computed based on
speciﬁc test statistic distributions and actual degrees of freedom
(assumed ﬁxed four degrees of freedom in disease traits).

BiForce is designed to provide fast screening of epistasis without
pre-ﬁltering of SNPs in GWAS. For disease traits, BiForce adopts the
approximation step implemented in BOOST (Wan et (11., 2010) as a
default option to accelerate the exhaustive genome scan, which can
be dismissed when necessary (i.e. using only log-likelihood ratio
tests in the exhaustive scan). Quality control procedures applied
in GWAS are required before using BiForce to analyse epistasis.
Currently, BiForce can only work with SNPs located on autosomal
chromosomes.

2.2 Experiments on simulation data

Simulation was used to test the performance of BiForce in binary
traits in comparison with BOOST (Wan et (11., 2010) and quantitative
traits in comparison with PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007) using 500
replicates for every simulation scenario (Supplementary Note 2).
For simplicity, in both comparison cases, we adopted the simulation
design used in the BOOST paper (Wan et (11., 2010), where BOOST
was compared against PLINK using simulation generated by the
program gs (Li and Chen, 2008) to measure the power of detection
and the program genomeSIMLA (Dudek et (11., 2006) for FPR
estimates. The gs program generated SNP genotypes using HapMap
data under the assumption of Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium, whereas
the genomeSIMLA program generated genotype data based on the
Affymetrix 500k SNP array to accommodate linkage disequilibrium
in real GWAS. The simulation design used four two-locus interaction
models each with marginal effects of the disease loci to generate
epistatic scenarios. Brieﬂy, considering two loci A (disease risk allele
(1) and B (disease risk allele b), Model 1 is a multiplicative model
(Marchini et (11., 2005); both Models 2 and 3 have the missing lethal
genotype (i.e. the double homozygote of disease alleles (1(1bb does
not lead to disease) (Li and Reich, 2000); Model 2 differs from
Model 3 mainly in the double heterozygous genotype AaBb that
does not lead to disease and has been used to describe the genetics
of handedness (Levy and Nagylaki, 1972; Neuman and Rice, 1992);
Model 4 is a well known XOR (exclusive OR) model where only
four single heterozygous genotypes (AABb,AaBB,A(1bb and aaBb)
lead to disease (Li and Reich, 2000; Moore and Williams, 2009)
(Supplementary Note 2).

Following the design, the four epistatic models were used to
generate epistatic scenarios for binary traits each with a ﬁxed disease
prevalence of 0.1, 1000 SNPs, a sample size of 800 or 1600 (with
balanced design) and a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.1 or 0.2
or 0.4 for disease SNPs (assumed equal MAF for both loci). Disease
heritability was set as 0.03 for Model 1 and 0.02 for Models 2—4.
The gs program simulated SNP genotypes and samples (either 800
or 1600) for each epistatic scenario. To apply the simulation design
to quantitative traits without the disease prevalence parameter while
maintaining the interaction pattern, genotypes in the contingency
table derived for each epistatic scenario for binary traits were scaled
down to concern only MAF and heritability (Supplementary Note 2).

High throughput analysis of epistasis in GWAS

 

The gs program simulated SNP genotypes and an R script was
used to simulate samples for quantitative traits with a standardized
distribution (mean of 0 and variance of 1) for each epistatic scenario
(Supplementary Note 2). We randomly chose the chromosome 11
HapMap data for gs to simulate the epistatic scenarios. Power was
calculated as the percentage of replicates with the simulated epistatic
SNP pair detected as a signiﬁcant signal out of the total of 500
replicates.

In addition, following the simulation design, the NULL scenarios
were generated using the genomeSIMLA program to simulate
38 836 SNPs based on the SNP information of chromosome 1
from the Affymetrix 500k SNP array as the BOOST paper (Wan
et (11., 2010), with 1000 samples simulated by randomly sampling
from a Bernoulli distribution for binary traits or from a Gaussian
distribution (mean of 0 and variance of 1) for quantitative traits. An
additional NULL scenario was used to examine FPRs where 1000
SNPs were randomly generated with MAFs uniformly distributed in
[0.05, 0.5]. FPR was calculated as the percentage of the total number
of signiﬁcant SNP pairs detected out of 500 replicates.

2.3 High-throughput analyses of epistasis

BiForce was used to analyse epistasis in eight metabolic traits in
the NFBC1966 cohort: C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic blood
pressure (DBP), glucose (GLU), high-density lipoprotein (HDL),
insulin (INS), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), systolic blood protein
(SBP) and triglycerides (TRI). Following the instructions given
in the original GWAS (Sabatti et (11., 2009), we ﬁrstly excluded
individuals according to the phenotypic exclusion criteria and then
undertook the procedures of quality control of genotype data and
corrected each trait for the SexCOPG covariate (recoded according
to gender, status of taking oral contraception and pregnancy)
(Supplementary Note 3). Furthermore, each trait was normalized
(instead of log transformed in the original GWAS (Sabatti et (11.,
2009)) using the ‘mtransform’ ﬁinction and then corrected for
relatedness using the ‘polygenic’ ﬁinction both available in the
GenABEL package (Aulchenko et (11., 2007a) implemented in R
(http://www.r-proj ect.org/) and the resultant environmental residuals
(i.e. pgresidualY) were used as the new trait values to test for
association (Aulchenko et (11., 2007b).

After the quality control and phenotype pre-processing, the
NFBC1966 cohort had 323 697 autosomal SNPs and >4500
individuals (ranged from 4579 in INS to 5255 in CRP) in different
traits. The consensus GWAS threshold (P=5.0E-08) (McCarthy
et (11., 2008) was applied to identify marginal SNPs. Following the
deﬁnitions in Section 2.1, with N as 323 697, the 5% genome-wide
threshold P-values were derived as 9.54E-13 for the ﬁill pair-wise
genome scan and 1.5E-07 for interactions with marginal SNPs if
only one marginal SNP was detected (or 7.7E-07, 5.1E-08, 3.9E-08,
3.1E-08, 2.6E-08, 2.2E-08, 1.9E-08, 1.7E-08 and 1.5E-08, if 2—10
marginal SNPs were detected, respectively).

BiForce was also used to analyse two WTCCC datasets: bipolar
disorder (BD) and Crohn’s disease (CD) that were obtained initially
for BiForce development with 1500 shared control individuals from
the UK Blood Services (Consortium, 2007). All individuals were
genotyped with the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K mapping array
set. After excluding 153 individuals with non-European ancestry
and quality control (Supplementary Note 3), in total 1458 shared
controls, 1868 ED cases (347 004 SNPs) and 1752 CD cases

3 RESULTS

3.1 Power and FPR on simulation experiments

Figure 1 shows the comparison of power of detection of epistasis
between BiForce and BOOST for binary traits. BiForce exhibited
higher or similar power across all epistatic scenarios simulated. The
BiForce power advantage over BOOST became more evident when
the sample size was 1600, e.g. power more than doubled when
MAF was 0.1 in Models 2—4, MAF was 0.2 and 0.4 in Model 1
and MAF was 0.2 in Model 3. The power gains in BiForce are
attributable to the use of the combined search algorithm through
detection of interactions involving marginal SNPs. If interactions
involving marginal SNPs are ignored or when no marginal SNPs
were involved in interactions, the power values from BiForce were
almost identical to those from BOOST since both use log-likelihood
ratio tests and a pair-wise genome scan.

The power of detection of epistasis in quantitative traits was
generally low across simulation scenarios (Fig. 2). With a sample
size of 800, neither BiForce nor PLINK could detect epistatic
signals. BiForce was clearly more powerful than PLINK in all
the scenarios with a sample size of 1600. The reasons for the
BiForce power gains include the use of the combined search
algorithm as before as well as the genotype models. In contrast to
the allelic models used in PLINK that can detect only additive—
additive interactions, the genotype models used in BiForce can
detect additional interaction components not captured by the allelic
model (e.g. additive dominance).

The simulation results of the NULL scenario generated by
genomeSIMLA showed that BiForce could control FPR at the 5%
genome-wide signiﬁcance level (Fig. 3). The FPR values became
slightly lower than the expected values as the Bonferroni-adjusted
thresholds became liberal (i.e. 20%). In the NULL simulation
scenario using random SNPs, the FPR of BiForce at the 5% genome-
wide signiﬁcance level was similar to that of BOOST and PLINK
and close to 5%, with slightly inﬂation in quantitative traits when
the Bonferroni-adjusted thresholds became liberal (Supplementary
Note 4). Using thresholds adjusted to the same level of FPR of 5%
made little differences to power proﬁles as shown in Figures 2 and
3 (Supplementary Note 4).

3.2 BiForce computational efﬁciency

We tested BiForce and BOOST in analysing datasets with 1000
samples and different numbers of SNPs on a single workstation (2.8
GHz Intel Core iMAC with 4 GB RAM and four CPU cores each
with two threads) to give a fair comparison. In addition, the same
tests were performed on a computer cluster of 32 nodes each with
four CPU cores (two threads per core). BiForce was found to be
about 30% faster than BOOST when using a single thread and 4—5-
fold faster when using eight threads (Table 1). Using the computer
cluster, BiForce was 315—330-fold faster than BOOST.

The above tests were not feasible for quantitative traits because
of very long PLINK computing times. Instead, we measured the
number of pair-wise tests computed per second by BiForce and
PLINK in the quantitative trait situation using 10 000 SNPs and
200 samples on the same workstation as before. BiForce computed
505 000 pair-wise tests per second when using a single thread
(2 380 714 using eight threads), whereas PLINK computed only

2990 pair-wise tests per second, i.e. a 168- and 796-fold speed
increase using one and eight threads, respectively.

We also tested BiForce on a large GWAS dataset with 500 000
SNPs and 5000 samples to give an idea of computing time in real
GWAS data. In the binary trait case, BiForce took 118.18, 30.8 and
0.46 h using one thread and eight threads on the workstation and
256 threads on the computer cluster, respectively. In the quantitative
trait case, BiForce took 293.24 and 6.81 h using eight threads on the
workstation and 256 threads on the cluster, respectively. In contrast,
FastEpistasis—a parallel extension of PLINK took 29, 4 or 0.5
days to analyse a GWAS dataset of the same size using 8, 64 or
512 MPI-bound processors, respectively (Schupbach et (11., 2010);
GBOOST—a graphical processing unit version of BOOST took 1.34
h to compute a smaller GWAS dataset of 351 542 SNPs and 5003
samples on a computer with Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 display card
(i.e. 240 CPU cores) (Yung et (11., 2011).

3.3 Epistasis in eight metabolic traits in NFBC1966

BiForce was used to analyse the eight metabolic traits in the
NFBC1966 cohort over a local (MRC Human Genetics Unit) cluster
of 32 computer nodes each with two Quad-cores (four threads per
core) giving a total of 256 threads running at 2.53 GHz per thread.
For each trait, BiForce splits the search into 32 small tasks each of
which was analysed using two threads and took on average 10.5 h to
complete. The whole analysis of eight traits was completed within
a day (<24 h).

Using the threshold of P=5.0E-08, we found 10, 4, 7, 4, 1
and 2 marginal SNPs associated with CRP, GLU, HDL, LDL,
SBP and TRI, respectively, and none associated with DBP or INS
(Supplementary Table S1). These results mostly agreed with the
original GWAS (Sabatti et (11., 2009) although we used genotype
models (instead of allelic models) and the more rigorous rank
transform of the data to normality (instead of the log-transform).

aAll SNP pairs listed were detected as marginal SNP interactions, with the threshold of 1.5E-08 for CRP, 2.2E-08 for HDL, 3.9E-08 for GLU and LDL, 7.7E-07 for TRI; SNP]
(SNP2)7name, genomic location and MAF (the latter two in bracket) of the ﬁrst (second) SNP; PimiP-value of the interaction test; distanceithe distance in base pairs between
two SNPs; LDilinkage disequilibrium (in r2) between a pair of SNPs; the SNP pair in HDL was also detected via the pair-wise genome scan (P < 9.54E-13).

bThe marginal SNP.

BiForce discovered nine genome-wide signiﬁcant epistatic SNP
pairs of which ﬁve were for CRP (essentially two epistatic signals
on chromosomes 1 and 12, respectively) and one was for each of
GLU, HDL, LDL and TRI (Table 2). All the nine epistatic pairs
were discovered as marginal SNP interactions (the ﬁrst seven were
between two marginal SNPs), while the rs3764261—rs1532624 pair
in HDL was also detected through the pair-wise genome scan. All
the epistatic SNPs had a relatively common MAF between 0.28
and 0.41. Interestingly, the interacting SNPs in each of the nine
epistatic pairs are located very closely together (< 1 Mb) with linkage
disequilibrium (LD, in r2) in a range between 0.35 and 0.99. No
signiﬁcant epistatic signals were detected in DBP, INS and SBP.

3.4 Epistasis in two disease traits in WTCCC

BiForce was used to analyse two disease traits BD and CD in the
WTCCC data over the same local computer cluster above. Using pre-
deﬁned genome-wide thresholds, we identiﬁed 3 and 25 marginal
SNPs (Supplementary Table S2), 5 and 12 genome-wide signiﬁcant
SNP pairs (Table 3) in BD and CD, respectively. Two of these
identiﬁed SNP pairs were detected as marginal SNP (rs4246045)
interactions, and the remaining were detected only through full
pair-wise genome scans. The SNP pairs of rs11162341—rs6658302,
rs11096892—rs6531531 and rs2747436—rs29254 were identiﬁed in
both BD and CD suggesting pleiotropic effects in these signals.
Again, all the identiﬁed SNP pairs were local interactions in ﬁve

loci: 1p31.1, 3q21.3, 4p15.1, 5q33.1 and 6p22.1, with SNP MAF
ranged from 0.05 to 0.29 and LD ranged between 0.02 and 0.82.
Similar observations were previously reported in the BOOST paper
(in Table 3 without detailed information of epistatic pairs of SNPs)
(Wan et (11., 2010) where the total number of SNP pairs detected
was slightly different possibly due to a doubled number of control
samples and slight differences in the quality control procedure used.

4 DISCUSSION

We have shown that BiForce is a unique tool that can support
high-throughput analysis of epistasis in GWAS for either binary or
quantitative traits. BiForce achieves great computational efﬁciency
by integrating three major advances in computing (i.e. bitwise
data structures, Boolean bitwise operations and multithreaded
parallelization) with fast calculation of pair-wise interactions. The
implementation of the combined search algorithm (i.e. using a less
stringent threshold to detect marginal SNP interactions) increases
the power of detection of epistasis. Through a series of performance
tests, we showed that BiForce was more powerﬁil and signiﬁcantly
faster than BOOST in binary traits and PLINK in quantitative
traits. Using real GWAS datasets from the NFBC1966 and WTCCC
cohorts, we demonstrated that BiForce could analyse multiple
traits in a short time period and identiﬁed genome-wide signiﬁcant
epistasis signals.

bThe marginal SNP.

The strategy of using a less stringent threshold for marginal
SNP interactions is statistically justiﬁable and has been validated
in simulations elsewhere (Kooperberg and Leblanc, 2008; Wei
et (11., 2010) and successﬁilly applied in real data analyses (Evans
et (11., 2011; Strange et (11., 2010; Wei et (11., 2011). Our simulation
results support the strategy and justify that BiForce is working as
expected. BiForce differs from BOOST mainly in the strategy of
detection of marginal SNP interactions, thus in binary traits the
power of detection by BiForce should be higher than or equal
to that from BOOST as shown in our simulation results (Fig. 1).
BiForce differs from PLINK in the strategy of detection of marginal
SNP interactions as well as the use of genotype models, and hence
it is not straightforward to assess the individual impact of the
strategy on the BiForce power gains in quantitative traits, especially
when the power of detection was generally low (Fig. 2). However,
with reference to the simulation results in the BOOST study (Wan
et (11., 2010) comparing BOOST (genotype models) against PLINK
(allelic models), it is clear that the power advantage in BiForce
over PLINK in scenarios using Model 1 with MAF of 0.2 and
0.4 (Fig. 2) can be mostly attributed to the strategy of detection
of marginal SNP interactions because the model simulated favours
the allelic models in these scenarios. Whereas in the scenario using
Model 4 with MAF of 0.4, the BiForce power advantage (Fig. 2)
can be attributed to the use of genotype models because as MAF
increases towards 0.5 the model simulated generates less marginal
effects and thus marginal SNP interactions are more difﬁcult to be
detected. Nevertheless, the power gains in BiForce are not surprising
because all the four interaction models favour marginal effects to
some extent. It is worth noting that allelic models implemented
in PLINK may have some advantage over BiForce in situations
where empty cells (i.e. no samples available in certain genotypes)
in the nine-cell contingency table (Supplementary Note 1) are
prevalent.

The NULL scenario simulation results (Fig. 3) ﬁlrther justify
BiForce. Using 38 836 SNPs simulated from a subset of human
genome (i.e. chromosome 1), the results suggest that BiForce has
a good control of FPR at the 5% level when LD is present.
Surprisingly, the FPR values became more deﬂated (i.e. lower than
the expected nominal error rates of 10 and 20%) when using less
stringent thresholds indicating the Bonferroni correction could be
conservative. This phenomenon was also observed in the BOOST
paper where it was suggested to be due to the LD among the
SNPs simulated (i.e. correlated tests) because no FPR deﬂation was
observed in the NULL simulation scenario using 1000 random SNPs
(Wan et (11., 2010). Our results of the NULL scenarios using 1000
random SNPs were in line with the BOOST results in binary traits
but showed certain FPR inﬂation in quantitative traits using either
BiForce or PLINK (Supplementary Note 4). Our results suggest that
in addition to LD, the ratio of number of SNPs to number of samples
in a study could be critical for the relevance of the signiﬁcance
thresholds based on Bonferroni correction under the assumption that
all pair-wise tests are independent.

One may expect that in real GWAS concerning the ﬁill genome,
the FPR at the 5% level may be further deﬂated because of
a much increased ratio of SNPs to samples and the power of
detection may be reduced owing to likely over-stringent Bonferroni-
corrected thresholds. The problem can become severe as more
and more SNPs are becoming available to GWAS. Therefore, the
simulation results in this study may be taken as evidence for
software comparisons but are not encouraged to be interpreted at the
genome-wide level. A good alternative way to derive the genome-
wide signiﬁcance thresholds is to use permutation. Unfortunately,
genome-wide permutation in real GWAS of epistasis would be
computational prohibitive even for BiForce. Before the threshold
issue is resolved, it is reasonable to use Bonferroni-corrected
thresholds so that signiﬁcant interactions identiﬁed from BiForce

High throughput analysis of epistasis in GWAS

 

would contain less false positives than expected, which may be
important to GWAS epistasis studies at the early stage. Nevertheless,
considering that the Bonferroni-corrected thresholds may be over-
stringent, BiForce allows user speciﬁed thresholds to be used in
epistasis detection.

The generally low power of detection of epistasis in quantitative
traits in simulation (Fig. 2) may be slightly discouraging. One
possible reason for the low power could be that the scaling applied
to genotype values (Section 2.2, Supplementary Note 2) might have
reduced contrasts among them. However, it becomes obvious that
a large proportion of existing GWAS have limited power to detect
epistasis through pair-wise genome scans due to relatively small
sample sizes used (Cordell, 2009; Gauderman, 2002; Wei et (11.,
2012; Zuk et (11., 2012), particularly in quantitative traits (Yang
et (11., 2010). Indeed, the epistasis results of the NFNC1966 cohort
(Table 2) suggest that excluding marginal SNP interactions, we could
identify only one epistatic pair in HDL through pair-wise genome
scans of eight metabolic traits despite that the sample size (5000) in
the NFBC1966 cohort is reasonably big. In contrast, 3 and 12 SNP
pairs were identiﬁed through pair-wise genome scans of the WTCCC
BD and CD, respectively (sample size <3500; Table 3) suggesting
WTCCC is slightly more powerﬁil than NFBC1966. Considering
that nine SNP pairs in CD could be regarded as one epistatic signal
because they were mapped to the same genomic location (3q21.3),
the power of detection in CD may not be much higher than that in
BD (Table 3).

After BiForce analyses, the identiﬁed statistical signiﬁcant
interactions need to be tested for replication in other GWAS
populations to avoid false positives (Wei et (11., 2011, 2012).
Nonetheless, statistical replication of the identiﬁed interactions and
ﬁlrther understanding their underlying biology are beyond the focus
of this article of presenting the computational efﬁciency of BiForce
as a fast screening tool. BiForce users are recommended to ﬁrstly
evaluate the epistasis results in the original GWAS population by re-
testing the statistical signiﬁcant epistatic signals jointly in models
considering various covariates and potential population stratiﬁcation
if necessary and then identify independent and important epistatic
SNP pairs for statistical replication and ﬁlrther analyses. Such re-
tests are essential for binary traits because BiForce in its current form
(based on contingency tables) is unable to accommodate covariates
in binary traits. Covariates can be approximately dealt with in
quantitative traits prior to BiForce analysis as demonstrated in the
epistasis analyses of the eight metabolic traits in the NFBC1966
cohort.

Interestingly, all the signiﬁcant epistatic pairs identiﬁed from
the NFBC1966 and WTCCC cohorts reﬂect interactions between
two closely located SNPs with a wide range of LD (Tables 2 and
3). The observation of rich local interactions could be taken as
supporting the hypothesis that some genetic variation in complex
traits may hide in epistasis between linked SNPs (Haig, 2011).
However, one immediate question is whether these epistatic pairs
are true interactions or mirroring marginal effects captured by
haplotypes. The epistatic pairs identiﬁed in quantitative traits involve
at least one marginal SNP (Table 2) whereas most of those identiﬁed
in the two disease traits involving no marginal SNPs (Table 3).
These results demonstrate that local interactions are not necessarily
associated with marginal SNPs (e.g. none of the 25 marginal SNPs
in CD listed in Supplementary Table S2 was involved in local
interactions) or driven by high LD between SNPs. A haplotype

effect could create an apparent statistical interaction when there
is only a single causative variant segregating. However, it may
be more likely to ﬁnd an apparent local interaction caused by a
haplotype effect when each SNP is in LD with a single causative
variant, but LD between SNPs is low. This arises because the
correlation between two SNPs in high LD means that ﬁtting the two
SNPs together may explain little additional variation over ﬁtting
just one SNP. Unfortunately, statistically distinguishing a haplotype
effect from a genuine local interaction is likely to be very difﬁcult
especially when only a limited sample of the variants available in
a region. A detailed study of genetic variation in the region and
other approaches such as functional genetic studies may be needed
to help disentangle local interactions and understand the underlying
mechanisms, e.g. intragenic and extragenic regulation mechanisms
(Rokop and Grossman, 2009) and interactions between coding and
regulatory variants within a gene (Lappalainen et (11., 2011).

With the performance presented, BiForce can remove the
computational bottleneck in analysing epistasis in single GWAS
populations. Indeed, BiForce has been used to analyse several
other dbGaP GWAS datasets with different numbers of SNPs
and samples (300—800k SNPs, 1800—6000 samples) in separate
studies of epistasis, including those from the GAIN Collaborative
Association Study of Psoriasis, GoKinD and GENEVA Diabetes
studies. However, routine high-throughput analysis of epistasis with
BiForce presents many new challenges. For example, we need
fast pipelines to interpret epistatic signals identiﬁed from high-
throughput analyses, perhaps making use of functional annotation to
include biological meaning. We also need methods to make good use
of sub-signiﬁcant epistatic signals given that many GWAS may have
low power to detect genome-wide signiﬁcant signals (Gauderman,
2002). In this case, a method to support meta-analysis of epistasis in
GWAS will be needed as BiForce is not applicable to imputed SNP
genotype data in its current form.

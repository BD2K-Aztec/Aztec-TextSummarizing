ABSTRACT

Motivation: Eukaryotic proteins are highly modular, containing
multiple interaction interfaces that mediate binding to a network
of regulators and effectors. Recent advances in high-throughput
proteomics have rapidly expanded the number of known protein—
protein interactions (PPls); however, the molecular basis for the
majority of these interactions remains to be elucidated. There has
been a growing appreciation of the importance of a subset of
these PPls, namely those mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs),
particularly the canonical and ubiquitous SH2, 8H3 and PDZ domain-
binding motifs. However, these motif classes represent only a small
fraction of known SLiMs and outside these examples little effort has
been made, either bioinformatically or experimentally, to discover the
full complement of motif instances.

Results: In this article, interaction data are analysed to identify and
characterize an important subset of PPls, those involving SLiMs
binding to globular domains. To do this, we introduce iELM, a method
to identify interactions mediated by SLiMs and add molecular details
of the interaction interfaces to both interacting proteins. The method
identifies SLiM-mediated interfaces from PPI data by searching
for known SLiM—domain pairs. This approach was applied to the
human interactome to identify a set of high-confidence putative
SLiM-mediated PPls.

1 INTRODUCTION

Short linear motifs (SLiMs) are compact domain binding interfaces
ubiquitous in eukaryotic proteomes. They mediate a range
of important cellular processes including protein scaffolding

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

[e.g. SOSl SH3 motifs (Kaneko et (11., 2008)], cell signalling
[e.g. PDZ motifs (Lee and Zheng, 2010)], subcellular compartment
targeting (e.g. nuclear localization signals (Fontes et (11., 2003)],
post-translational modiﬁcation [e.g. sumoylation (Yang and
Gregoire, 2006)] and cleavage [e.g. caspase 3 cleavage sites (Pop
and Salvesen, 2009)]. SLiMs consist of ~3—10 amino acids though
usually only 2—4 residues are strictly required for binding. As a
result of the limited number of residues contacting their binding
partner, SLiMs bind with low afﬁnity [usually between 1.0 and
150 micromolar (Diella et (11., 2008)] distinguishing them from
domain—domain interactions that often have an afﬁnity in the
nanomolar range (Neduva et (11., 2005). This attribute of a weak-
binding afﬁnity renders SLiM-mediated interactions difﬁcult to
detect experimentally (Diella et (11., 2008). A number of resource-
and time-intensive experiments are therefore required to properly
validate a SLiM, ranging from mutational analysis to structural
studies (Davey et (11., 2012). The use of bioinformatics is therefore
an important technique to direct or augment the experimental
elucidation of SLiMs.

A number of databases have been developed to facilitate our
understanding of SLiMs. The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM)
resource (Dinkel et (11., 2012) contains over 1600 experimentally
validated SLiM instances while the Minimotif Miner (Mi et (11.,
2012) database has collected over 880 consensus sequences. These
datasets generate insights into the attributes of SLiMs, such as their
conservation among homologues and enrichment in disorder. This
enables the development of prediction servers within both the ELM
and Minimotif Miner resources to ﬁlter novel instances based on
the attributes of the curated regular expressions. However, both
servers have issues with over-prediction. The SLiMSearch resource
(Davey et (11., 2011) expands this methodology to whole proteome
searches. This method scores a SLiM instance by assessing the
sequence conservation of the motif in its orthologous proteins,
however, disordered regions are often poorly aligned and this can
lead to an artiﬁcially low score for some motifs (Perrodou et (11.,
2008). The Anchor (Meszaros et (11., 2009) predictors rely on the
propensity for SLiMs to undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon
binding and a-MORF-Pred (Mohan et (11., 2006) identiﬁes patterns
in a disorder prediction output. Other resources have focused on a
subset of SLiMs (Hui and Bader, 2010; Li et (11., 2008), for example,

Identification of SLiM interfaces

 

ScanSite (Obenauer et (11., 2003) was established to identify short
protein sequence motifs based on peptide library and phage display
experiments.

The growth in the number of protein complexes with a determined
3D structure has facilitated the development of structural tools
to predict SLiM speciﬁcities (Betel et (11., 2007; Encinar et (11.,
2009; King and Bradley, 2010; Petsalaki et (11., 2009; Stein and
Aloy, 2010). The ADAN database (Encinar et (11., 2009) utilizes
the FoldX algorithm (Schymkowitz et (11., 2005) to perform an
assessment of the stability and afﬁnity of peptide—domain complexes
under in silico mutagenesis analysis. However, the requirement for
extensive knowledge of these interfaces has generally curtailed this
type of method to well-studied and ubiquitous domains, such as
the SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains (Encinar et (11., 2009; Stein and
Aloy, 2010). The exception is PepSite (Petsalaki et (11., 2009), which
provides a generic method to predict peptide binding by using a
position-speciﬁc scoring matrix to predict peptide binding though
this all-encompassing approach lead to a decrease in accuracy
when compared with domain-speciﬁc methods. SLiM prediction
has also taken advantage of the recent advances in high-throughput
proteomics (Beltrao and Serrano, 2005; Edwards et (11., 2007;
Linding et (11., 2007; Neduva et (11., 2005), for example, Dilimot
(Neduva et (11., 2005) and SLiMFinder (Edwards et (11., 2007)
identify novel SLiM classes by searching for enriched motifs
within interaction data while NetworKIN (Linding et (11., 2007)
uses protein—protein interaction (PPI) data to elucidate the kinase
associated with a particular phosphorylation site. However, the
inherent noise within PPI networks hinders these methods. Despite
these advances in the area of SLiM discovery tools, outside the
intensively experimentally studied SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains,
the expected deluge of new SLiM instances and classes has not
occurred. Nevertheless, there is clearly signal in each of the methods
described as demonstrated by the positive results produced in the
analyses of Translin (Neduva et (11., 2005), EH-1 (Copley, 2005)
and KENBox (Michael et (11., 2008) SLiM classes, as well as, the
identiﬁcation of kinases associated with particular phosphorylation
sites by NetworKin (Linding et (11., 2007).

In this study, we produce a high-conﬁdence list of human
SLiM-mediated interfaces by creating a method (iELM) that
identiﬁes SLiM—domain partners from interaction data. A dataset
of SLiM-binding domains and SLiM-mediated interactions was
manually curated from the literature. These annotated domains
were used to train Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to speciﬁcally
recognize SLiM-binding domains associated with a particular ELM
class. To identify true SLiM instances a combination of methods,
relying on known SLiM attributes, were incorporated allowing the
assessment of a binary interaction for a complimentary SLiM-
domain partnership. This association is also assessed for structural
feasibility by the structural bioinformatics tool, PepSite. The iELM
method enables the analysis of the human interactome for SLiM-
mediated interfaces and interactions. A list of high-conﬁdence
SLiM-mediated interfaces for the human interactome is produced
and can be accessed at http://elmint.embl.de.

2 METHODS

iELM assesses a binary interaction for a SLiMAiomain interface and, if
present, outputs the SLiM sequence and the globular domain putatively
responsible for binding.

2.1 Datasets

The SLiM functional classes used in iELM were extracted, in the form of a
regular expression, from the ELM database (2011-03). The ELM resource
annotation did not include information about the binding partners and binding
domain for each ELM class. To identify this information, the 3DID resource
(Stein et al., 2011) was parsed for the SLiM-binding domains in complex
with a peptide from an ELM class; however, this search only identiﬁed 28%
(44) of the binding domains for the ELM classes. To identify the remaining
72% (112) of SLiM-binding domains a literature search was undertaken.
The annotation process recorded the UniProt ID, the binding domain and the
domain’s position within the sequence as well as, when possible, the afﬁnity
of the binding (see Supplementary Table S3).

2.1.1 Annotation of true positive SLiM-mea’iatea1 interface a'ataset The
true positive dataset is the experimentally annotated dataset of SLiMAiomain
interaction interfaces (SLiMDoM dataset) based on the aforementioned
literature survey and the crystal structures retrieved from the 3DID database.
The SLiMDom test dataset consists of 1080 SLiMAiomain-mediated
interactions and the training set comprises of 434 SLiMAiomain-mediated
interactions. This dataset was divided for each ELM class in a 3:1 divide
with respect to testing and training.

A second true positive dataset based on the annotation from the Domino
(Ceol et al., 2007) resource (version 2009-10) was also assembled. The
Domino database annotates the sequences of peptides experimentally shown
to bind to a particular globular domain. With our a priori knowledge of the
Pfarn domain (Finn et al., 2010) that binds an ELM class, the appropriate
ELM regular expression (Dinkel et al., 2012) was used to search within the
binding peptides. The results were recorded and are referred to as the Domino
dataset (Supplementary Table S4) consisting of 1684 interactions.

2.1.2 False positive or control SLiM-mea’iatea1 interface a'atasets
Experimentally validated negative instances are too rare to be used as a
control group. Instead a false positive dataset of SLiM-mediated interfaces
unlikely to be true was constructed. The majority of these interfaces are likely
to be true negatives, however, since our knowledge of SLiMs and PPIs is
incomplete, this set will undoubtedly contain functional instances and true
interactions.

Two false positive datasets (SLiMDoM- and Domino-False Positive
Datasets) were created to be speciﬁc controls for each of the aforementioned
true positive datasets and the same procedure was applied to each. First, all
proteins in these datasets were collected along with their associated ELM
class(es). These proteins were combined in all possible combinations such
that in a dataset of 10 proteins, each protein would have nine interactions.
This list was then ﬁltered for proteins associated with the same ELM class
as well as for known interactions [using STRING resource v9.0 (Szklarczyk
et al., 201 1)]. After these ﬁltering steps, 211 600 protein pairs were present for
the false positive SLiMDoM dataset and 111 156 pairs were present within
the false positive Domino dataset. These datasets were pruned to produce two
datasets each containing 30000 interactions. The datasets used to train the
support vector machine (SVM) algorithm are described in the Supplementary
Material.

A ﬁnal test dataset was constructed to assess the performance of the
iELM method on ‘real-world’ PPI data from the BioGrid (Stark et al., 2011)
database (version 3.1.70). This PPI network was randomized by node degree
conservation using the Neat web server (Brohee et al., 2008) to ensure the
underlying structure of the network remained intact.

2.2 HMM production

The HMMs were trained on a multiple sequence alignment consisting
of the experimentally annotated SLiM-binding domain instance and its
orthologous proteins. The underlying assumption of this being that the
orthologous domains of the annotated domain would also bind the motif.
The orthologous sequences of the annotated protein were identiﬁed using
the Gopher programme (Davey et al., 2007) to search the UniProt database

(UniProt release 2011-05) (UniProt Consortium, 2010) by BLAST reciprocal
best hit for each species (Altschul et al., 1990). These orthologous proteins
were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment programme Muscle
(Edgar, 2004) and the position of the SLiM-binding domain identiﬁed
within the alignment. To remove poorly sequenced and/or incorrectly
identiﬁed orthologues, aligned domains with indels covering > 10% of
the reference domain sequence were removed. The sequences were then
iteratively realigned and poorly aligned sequences removed until a set of
orthologues were identiﬁed with <10% indel coverage compared with the
curated reference SLiM-binding domain. The HMMs were trained on this
alignment using the HMMer programme’s (Eddy, 1998) HMMBuild. The
HMMs produced by this process are the ‘domain identiﬁer” HMMs. For the
benchmarking, only the 434 HMMs made from the SLiMDom training set
were used.

2.3 Modelling domains for PepSite

PepSite requires a Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure in order to predict
the binding position of a peptide. The sequences of all the 3D structures
from the PDBe database (Velankar and Kleywegt, 2011) were blasted
against the human UniProt (UniProt Consortium, 2010) sequences for
matches with a sequence identity of >30%. For all the non-identical
matches detected, structural models of the domain were produced using the
MODELLER programme (Eswar et al., 2006) (see Supplementary Fig. S4
for receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) for PepSite benchmarking
on models).

2.4 Training SVM kernel

The score for the iELM resource is calculated using a SVM learning
algorithm (Joachims, 2002). The SVM algorithm was trained on the SVM
true positive and SVM false positive datasets (see Supplementary Material).
The iELM method was run with 75% of the data used as a training dataset
and 25% as a test dataset and a SVM trained model produced.

2.5 Method outline

2.5.1 Domain identiﬁer The HMMer package’s HMMSearch programme
was used to search a sequence using the domain identiﬁer HMMs. The
domain identiﬁer uses an E-value cut-off of 0.01 (Finn et al., 2010) and,
in order to remove fragment hits, all hits with a length of <80% of the
annotated SLiM-binding domain’s length were also rejected; if a result is
returned, the E-value score(s) is converted into a domain score. The domain
score is a similarity score to the optimal score of an annotated SLiM-binding
domain of similar length. This calculation was based on the equation of
the regression line calculated from the optimal E -value hit for each domain
against the length of the annotated HMM (Pearson’s correlation value 0.96).
The HMM_length is the length of the HMM used to make the prediction
and the E-value is the estimated likelihood calculated by the HMMSearch
programme:

X —1.93E—value

_ HMM_length— 1.076
2.5.2 iELM method iELM predicts the SLiM-mediated interfaces of a
single binary interaction by combining the domain identiﬁer with the
motif discovery programme SLiMSearch (Davey et al., 2011), the disorder
predictor IUPred (Dosztanyi et al., 2005) and the structural analysis
programme PepSite (Petsalaki et al., 2009) (see workﬂow in Fig. 1).

2.5.3 Interface-pair identiﬁcation A binary interaction is ﬁrst queried for
interacting domains as annotated in the 3DID resource (Stein et al., 2011).
The identiﬁcation of a putative domainAiomain interaction between the
binary partners leads to the search being discontinued and the domain7
domain interaction being returned. Otherwise, the two proteins in the binary
interaction are searched using the following two procedures. The Domain

identiﬁer searches a sequence using the domain identiﬁer HMMs in order to
identify putative SLiM-binding domains. If a putative SLiM-binding domain
is present, a search is undertaken for the corresponding SLiM of the same
ELM class in the interacting protein. The SLiMSearch programme uses a
regular expression, annotated within the ELM resource, to identify potential
SLiMs and assigns a Relative Local Conservation (RLC) score of the residues
based on a multiple alignment of the sequence and its orthologues [see
Davey et al. (2011) for details]. The SLiM and its surrounding residues
are then assessed for their propensity to be in a region of intrinsic disorder
using IUPred. The SLiMSearch programme also outputs a score for the
Conservation Score (Chica et al., 2008) and a RLC variance score indicating
the differences in conservation between the individual amino acids of the
SLiM instance. Contextual information such as overlapping Pfam Domains
and PDB structures (Velankar and Kleywegt, 2011) is also included.

2.5.4 Interface-pair scoring If a complimentary SLiMAiomain
association is found then the score from the domain identiﬁer and the SLiM
detection methods are assessed using a SVM trained model, otherwise the
search discontinues. The following scores are considered using SVMligm
classify programme (Joachims, 2002) for assessment: Domain score, RLC
score, RLC variance, IUPred disorder score, the Conservation score and
HMM length. Finally, the SLiMAiomain interface is assessed using PepSite,
to test whether or not the binding is biophysically feasible. This requires a
PDB structure (or a model) of the putative SLiM-binding domain. If such
a 3-dimensional structure is available, PepSite analyses the SLiM-binding
domain for the likely binding position of the peptide, producing a putative
binary complex and a score for the likelihood of the interaction. This score
is not included in the iELM score calculated by the SVM, because identiﬁed
SLiM-binding domains often do not have known 3D structures with >30%
sequence identity and therefore cannot be assessed using PepSite.

2.6 Method assessment

2.6.1 Dataset assessment The datasets were split into training and test
datasets and assessed for sensitivity and speciﬁcity:

. . . Number of true positives
Sen51t1tv1ty=

 

Number of true positives+Number of false negatives

. . . Number of true negatives
Speclﬁclty:

 

Number of true negatives+Number of false positives
The true hits are considered correct if the annotated SLiM and SLiM-
binding domain positions were predicted to bind with a score above the set
threshold.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Features of SLiM—domain interfaces

The annotated SLiMDom dataset reveals that many globular domain
classes bind to multiple ELM classes (156 ELM classes annotated
to 85 globular domain ﬁinctional classes). Those globular domain
Pfam families that bind multiple ELM classes can be broadly divided
into two categories. The ﬁrst type, have an over-arching canonical
SLiM with subgroups, in general, deﬁned by slight differences in
ﬂanking residues of the motif. These classes partially overlap with
changes in binding afﬁnity distinguishing closely related subgroups
[e.g. Huang et (11. (2008); Kay et (11. (2000)]. For example, the core
constituent of the canonical SH3-binding SLiM is PxxP (x = any
amino acid) with the speciﬁcity of the subgroups of this domain
class arising from the ﬂanking residues (e.g. YxxPxxP as compared
to PxxPxR) (Li, 2005). The second category can also be divided into
subgroups, however in contrast to the ﬁrst type, no over-arching
canonical SLiM can be deﬁned, as the SLiMs associated with

Fig. 1. A workﬂow for the iELM method. The pipeline proceeds through
four major stages utilizing the 3DID resource (purple), the SLiM-binding
domain identiﬁcation method (green), the SLiMSearch methods (yellow)
and the PepSite structural bioinformatic methods (red). After this step, the
bioinformatic pipeline ends and laboratory veriﬁcation is required.

this type of domain family are too diverse. These subgroups often
contain only paralogous proteins and have SLiM speciﬁcities that are
very deﬁnitive and often exclusive to each subgroup. For example,
the WD40 domains of beta-TrCP (uniprot: Q9Y297) bind to a
phospho-dependent degron SLiM (LIG_SCF_TrCP_1 - DSGxxS)
while the WD40 repeats of PEX7 (uniprot: 000628) binds to a
seemingly unrelated SLiM (TRG_PTS2 — Rxxx[LIV]xx[HQ][LIF])
(Stimimann et (11., 2010).

A method for identifying SLiM-domains must be able to
distinguish between the aforementioned subgroups. The use of
HMMs to identify globular domains and transmembrane regions
is well established (Eddy, 1998; Finn et (11., 2010) and incorporated
into resources such as Pfam. The HMMs trained by Pfam recognize
ﬁinctional domain groups and could therefore be used to identify
SLiM-binding domains. However, these HMMs are not able to
distinguish the aforementioned intra—domain binding speciﬁcities,
since the training of Pfam HMMs does not take into account
the subcategorization of a domain family by SLiM speciﬁcities.
We therefore used the annotated and experimentally validated
SLiM-binding domains (and their orthologues) to train HMMs. By
incorporating known binding speciﬁcities, those HMMs trained to
recognize SLiM-binding domain should distinguish the subgroups

of those ﬁinctional globular domains that bind multiple ELM classes
(see Supplementary Material for details).

3.2 Benchmarking the domain identiﬁer

Two types of HMMs were used: those extracted from Pfam (version
25.0) and those that we generated based on the experimentally
validated SLiM-binding domains (domain identiﬁer HMMs) (from
the training set—see Section 2 for details). For each of the SLiM—
domain interactions from the SLiMDoM dataset, the benchmarking
assessed whether either the Pfam- or domain identiﬁer HMMs
identiﬁed the known binding domain. The domain identiﬁer HMMs
achieved a sensitivity of 84.0% (907/1080) and a speciﬁcity of
90.1% [false positive rate (FPR): 2696/30 000]. Pfam HMMs
accomplished a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 65.1% (703/1080)
and 72.1% (FPR: 8370/30 000), respectively (see ROC curves in
Fig. 2a) suggesting that the use of HMMs trained on SLiM-binding
domains is a more effective way of identifying putative SLiM-
binding domains. The domain identiﬁer HMMs were also assessed
for intra—domain speciﬁcities using the annotated SH2 and SH3
domains. The domain identiﬁer HMMs achieved a speciﬁcity of
83.9% and a sensitivity of 80.3% (see Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.3 iELM benchmark

The iELM method was benchmarked using two separate datasets.
The ﬁrst consists of experimentally validated SLiM-mediated
interaction data (SLiMDoM dataset) and the second is based on
the Domino dataset, which is curated from the Domino database’s
experimentally annotated peptide—domain interactions (for ﬁill
results see Supplementary Table S5). The performance of iELM on
the SLiMDoM dataset using the domain identiﬁer HMMs (cut-off
= —1.0) was a sensitivity of 84.8% (916/1080) and a speciﬁcity of
86.5% (FPR: 4050/30 000) while using the Pfam HMMs decreased
both the sensitivity and speciﬁcity scores to 76.1% (822/1080) and
80.4% (FPR: 5880/30 000), respectively (Fig. 2b). Using iELM
(cut-off = —1.0) with the domain identiﬁer HMMs on the Domino
benchmark dataset achieved a sensitivity of 75.5% (1272/1684) and
a speciﬁcity of 83.4% (FPR: 4980/30 000). In comparison, the use
of Pfam HMMs managed a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 60.9%
(1025/1684) and 79.4% (FPR: 6180/30 000), respectively (Fig. 2c).
The application of the SVM was contrasted to using a cut-off system,
based on the recommendations in the respective papers. The cut-
off version of iELM (IUPred: 0.4; Motif score: 0.5; Domain score:
0.4) on the SLiMDoM dataset achieved a slightly better speciﬁcity
89.3% (FPR: 3111/30 000) but a much lower sensitivity of 70.4%
(760/1080) than the SVM-based method.

The iELM method was also benchmarked on ‘real world’ data
whose interactions were collected independently of whether or
not they were SLiM mediated. The BioGrid interaction dataset
and a randomized version of this dataset (both containing 46 676
interactions) were assessed using iELM (cut-off = —1.0) with the
domain identiﬁer HMMs. Within the BioGrid interaction dataset,
11 153 SLiM-mediated interactions were identiﬁed compared to
1112 in the randomized network suggesting a FPR of 9.97%.

3.4 Human interactome analysis

The interfaces for the majority of PPIs are still unknown and it is
therefore of interest to detect novel motif-mediated interfaces on
a proteome-wide scale. A human PPI network comprising 306 211

interactions [extracted from STRING (Szklarczyk et (11., 2011) v9.0;
PPIs; cut-off = 0.6] was assessed using the iELM method (cut-off
= —1.0). In total, 12562 PPIs and 35 476 interfaces were predicted
as SLiM-mediated by iELM, including 7251 predicted structures
(PepSite score < 0.25) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table S2). A
large number of these PPIs are mediated by multiple SLiM classes
or SLiM instances, for example, in the interaction between GRB2
(uniprot:P62993) and SOSl (uniprot2Q07889); SOSl has seven
putative SH3 motifs and GRB2 has two SH3 domains, potentially
this can equate to 14 binding interfaces for a single PPI. The
putative motif interface map of the human interactome, produced
by the iELM method, identiﬁed a large number of potentially novel
SLiM-mediated interfaces as well as demonstrating the ability of
iELM to automatically annotate the edges of interactions within
a PPI network. To explore the interactome produced by iELM,
the putative SLiM-mediated-interaction interfaces associated with
the cell division cycle protein 20 (CDC20; uniprot: Q12834)
were studied. CDC20 is a regulatory subunit of the anaphase-
promoting complex (APC/C) that targets proteins for ubiquitination

In early mitosis, CDC20 joins the APC/C complex and targets
substrates for ubiquitination containing either a destruction box
SLiM (Glotzer et (11., 1991) (D-box—RxxLxx<p— (p: hydrophobic
amino acid) or a KEN-box (Pﬂeger and Kirschner, 2000) (xKENx).
The iELM method identiﬁed 34 PPIs (from 246 binary interactions)
with 41 putative SLiM-mediated interfaces that bind to CDC20 via
a D-box motif. All the experimentally annotated (seven instances)
ELM instances of D-box SLiMs (including human orthologues of
non-human instances) were identiﬁed as well as ﬁve additional
experimentally validated SLiMs (Peters, 2006). iELM identiﬁed
a number of interesting candidate interfaces binding to CDC20
including the sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5), a protein
necessary for spindle formation during mitosis, a process whose
completion synchronizes with the formation of the APC/C complex
(Song and Rape, 2010) (see Supplementary Fig. S3).

Identification of SLiM interfaces

 

In addition, we investigated a subnetwork of the human
SLIM-mediated PPI network associated with four SLiM binding
proteins: Clathrin heavy chain 1 (CLH1) (uniprot: 000610),
ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein GGA3 (GGA3) (uniprot:
Q9NZ52), E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4 (NEDD4) (uniprot:
P46934) and tumour susceptibility gene 101 protein (TSG101)
(uniprot: Q99816), and their interactions (Fig. 3a). This subnetwork
contains 810 interactions, 173 of which are predicted by iELM as
SLiM-mediated interactions. This number includes SLiM interfaces
from three different categories of ELM (LIG or ligand, MOD
or modiﬁcation, and TRG or targeting) and 14 different classes
(Fig. 30). Of these 173 putative interactions, approximately half are
predicted to bind to NEDD4 via a WW—binding motif associated
with ubiquitinating substrates. The remainder of the putative
protein interfaces function within endocytic-related pathways;
for example, the Clathrin-Box motif-mediated interactions are
associated with Clathrin-mediated vesicular trafﬁcking. The protein
hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS)
(uniprot: 014964) was extracted from this network and its module
architecture investigated (Fig. 3d). This protein contains putative
SLiMs for targeting HGS for ubiquitination (via NEDD4), Clathrin-
mediated endocytosis (via CLH1), signalling via Grb2 and P85A
(uniprot: P27986) as well as an annotated PTAP SLiM, involved in
the ESCRT signalling. Furthermore, 3DID data predict a domain—
domain interaction with Toml (uniprot: 060784). This subnetwork
highlights the information about functionality and directionality that
can be gamered by mapping SLiM-predictions onto PPI networks.

4 DISCUSSION

SLiM-mediated binding interfaces are key components of the human
proteome (Jorgensen and Linding, 2008) and are abundant within
the signalling pathways of the cell (Pawson, 2007). In this article, we
manually annotated domain-binding partners for 156 ELM classes
and curated 1514 SLiM-mediated interfaces, thus generating a high-
quality dataset for studying the interfaces between speciﬁc ELM
classes and their interacting domains. This dataset enabled us to train
HMMs for identifying SLiM-binding domains. These models were
then incorporated into a novel method called iELM with the aim of
detecting SLiM-mediated interfaces. iELM was able to distinguish
speciﬁcities within SLiM-binding domains (see Supplementary
Fig. S2), as well as identify SLiM-mediated interactions from a
background of PPIs (Fig. 3). The iELM method uses an SVM
algorithm in preference to a simple cut-off system due to our wish
to develop a method with the best ratio between sensitivity and
speciﬁcity. A comparison of these two techniques identiﬁes the SVM
model as having a higher sensitivity but a lower speciﬁcity, with the
ratio weighted in favour of the SVM model. This suggests that using
the SVM will identify a greater number of true positive interactions
with only a slight increase in the FPR. iELM, so far, covers only
linear motifs as they are annotated in the ELM resource, but is easily
extendible to any SLiM, in the form of a regular expression, for
which the interacting SLiM-binding domain is known.

The importance of a number of canonical and ubiquitous domains
(e.g. SH2, SH3, PDZ and Pkinase) in signalling and regulatory
networks has lead to a great deal of work focusing on their SLiM-
binding properties (Beltrao and Serrano, 2005; Encinar et (11., 2009;
Gfeller et (11., 2011; Huang et (11., 2008; Hui and Bader, 2010;

Li, 2005; Linding et (11., 2007; Stein and Aloy, 2010). These
domains are abundant in higher eukaryotes with small differences
in amino acid composition leading to subtle shifts in speciﬁcities
(Encinar et (11., 2009; Gfeller et (11., 2011; Huang et (11., 2008).
In the ELM resource, and by association in iELM, however, these
subtle shifts in speciﬁcity are not necessarily fully explored. This is
because for a particular SLiM functional class the ELM resource’s
annotation process aims to curate the full spectrum of variation
within eukaryotes; potentially this can allow too broad a speciﬁcity
for a SLiM and lead to false positive results. Despite these potential
problems, the iELM method performed strongly on benchmarking
datasets and was able to distinguish speciﬁcities for these ubiquitous
domains. More importantly, iELM incorporates the less well-known
SLiM classes (over two-thirds of those annotated in ELM) that
do not have this overlapping intra—domain speciﬁcity enabling a
more extensive array of SLiM-mediated interfaces to be predicted
for the human interactome. This is illustrated by those interactions
associated with targeting proteins for destruction, using D-box
motifs, as well as by a subnetwork of interconnected SLiM-mediated
interactions linked to endocytosis.

The automatic annotation of the molecular detail of a protein—
protein interface is an important step in understanding the function
of many of the interactions identiﬁed by proteomic experiments.
In this study, we developed a novel method enabling for the ﬁrst
time, to our knowledge, the fast and automatic annotation of SLiM-
mediated interactions on large-scale datasets. The development
of iELM permitted us to produce an edge-based interactome of
12 562 interactions with 35476 interfaces representing ~4% of
the known human interactome. This number is likely to represent
only a small fraction of the SLiM-mediated interactions within the
interactome, as it is only based on 156 ELM classes and SLiM-
mediated interactions are known to be under-represented in mass
spectrometry-derived proteomic data (Gavin et (11., 2006). The ﬁnal
percentage is difﬁcult to estimate as the total number of SLiM classes
is unknown but taking into consideration that there are over 13 000
globular domain classes annotated in Pfam, the potential inﬂuence
of SLiM-mediated interactions is prodigious.

The annotation of the edges of PPI networks allows a more
biologically realistic edge-based analysis of PPI networks to be
implemented. This is important, as proteins are modular entities
whose ﬁinction can vary depending on their interaction partners.
Furthermore, as proteins have a ﬁnite number of binding sites, an
appreciation of the location of their interaction surface will facilitate
models to consider mutually exclusive binding. The use of a node-
based view generalizes these properties and therefore loses the
subtleties of a protein’s behaviour, while an edge-based view would
distinguish this difference enabling a more accurate portrayal of
cellular networks.

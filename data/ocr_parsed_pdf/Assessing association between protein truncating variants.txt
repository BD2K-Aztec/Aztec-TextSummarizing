ABSTRACT

Motivation: In sequencing studies of common diseases and quantita-
tive traits, power to test rare and low frequency variants individually is
weak. To improve power, a common approach is to combine statistical
evidence from several genetic variants in a region. Major challenges are
how to do the combining and which statistical framework to use.
General approaches for testing association between rare variants and
quantitative traits include aggregating genotypes and trait values,
referred to as ‘collapsing’, or using a score-based variance component
test. However, little attention has been paid toalternative modelstailored
for protein truncating variants. Recent studies have highlighted the im-
portant role that protein truncating variants, commonly referred to as
‘loss of function’ variants, may have on disease susceptibility and quan-
titative levels of biomarkers. We propose a Bayesian modelling frame-
work forthe analysis of protein truncating variants and quantitative traits.
Results: Our simulation results show that our models have an advan-
tage over the commonly used methods. We apply our models to se-
quence and exome-array data and discover strong evidence of
association between low plasma triglyceride levels and protein trun-
cating variants at APOC3 (Apolipoprotein 03).

1 INTRODUCTION

Advances in DNA sequencing and customized exome arrays
are quickly transforming the landscape of genomic studies of
diseases and related quantitative traits (Bonnefond et al., 2012;
Jonsson et al., 2012; Momozawa et al., 2011; Nejentsev et al.,
2009; Rivas et al., 2011). In sequencing studies of common dis-
eases and quantitative traits, power to individually test any rare
or low frequency variant is typically weak in attainable sample

sizes. Hence, to boost the ability to detect signal, evidence is
combined across variants. When

designing such an ‘aggregation’ test, there are three main
questions to consider:

0 Across which biological units should variants be combined?

0 Which variants mapping within those units should be
included?

0 Which statistical models should be used?

As for the first question, an obvious choice of biological unit
across which to combine variants is the gene, and we focus on
this throughout the article, considering all the coding sequence of
the gene as the relevant unit. An alternative would be to combine
variants across all genes within a pathway, but this adds several
complications, not least because of the currently rather imprecise
knowledge of biological pathways.

Within a gene one could include all observed variants, but this
would be likely to include many neutral variants and/or variants
with opposite direction of effects, both of which can lead to loss of
power under many statistical methods. The ideal approach would
be to combine only those variants that affect the trait of interest.
This is, however, difﬁcult in practice because these will not be
known in advance. One approximation would be to include
only the variants with functional effects. Even this is challenging
with current limited knowledge of the function of coding variants
in the human genome: commonly used predictors of the function
of non-synonymous variants (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Kumar et al.,
2009) can often be unreliable (Flanagan et al., 2010).

One class of variants where functional prediction is much
more straightforward is that which truncates the resulting pro-
tein product (stop-gain, ﬁameshift coding, splice disrupting). The
functional prediction is made based on the translational conse-
quence of a mutation against a reference transcript set, for ex-
ample, Gencode. Protein truncating variants (PTVs) are typically
subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a cellular mechan-
ism that detects nonsense mutations and prevents the expression
of truncated proteins, resulting in loss of function of that copy of
the protein. To a ﬁrst approximation, PTVs are thus likely to
have the same functional consequence, namely, loss of function

(though see below for a more nuanced treatment), so that vari-
ants in this class within a gene may naturally be combined in
assessing their effect on a trait or phenotype of interest. A second
reason for focussing on PTVs is that there is ample evidence from
studies of Mendelian phenotypes, common diseases and quanti-
tative traits (Chen et al., 2011; Herman et al., 2012; Jones et al.,
2009; Pollin et al., 2008) that PTVs play an important role in the
genetic architecture of human traits. Recent studies have high-
lighted and characterized PTVs (Cohen et al., 2005; Hoﬂ<er,
2010; Isidor et al., 2011; MacArthur et al., 2012; Musunuru
et al., 2010; Nejentsev et al., 2009; Rivas et al., 2011;
Schonfeld, 2003), commonly referred to as ‘loss of function’
(LoF) variants (MacArthur et al., 2012). These studies describe
the effect and frequency of PTVs: they can have strong effects on
phenotype, and they are, in general, rare, as selection has played
a role in preventing them from reaching a high frequency in the
population (MacArthur et al., 2012).

Here, we introduce a new statistical method for assessing asso-
ciation between PTVs and quantitative traits. We ﬁrst consider
the straightforward case in which all PTVs are assumed to have
the same effect, which would be appropriate, for example, if all
caused loss of function. We then extend this approach to allow for
the possibility that some PTVs have one effect and some have
another, for example, if most PTVs are subject to NMD, and
hence are LoF, whereas some (e.g. in the ﬁnal exon) escape
NMD and can act as loss of function, gain of function (by deleting
an inhibitory domain) or neutral variants. The approach could be
extended to allow more than two groups of PTVs, with PTVs in
each group having the same effect, but for deﬁniteness we focus in
this article on the case of either one or two groups.

We study the properties of the new method and compare it with
other approaches. A simple alternative to our similar effects
model is to use the mean trait value of the PTV carriers as the
test statistic [see e. g. the collapsing methods of Li and Leal (2008)].
Other methods in our comparisons include the sequence kernel
association test (SKAT) (Wu et al., 2011), SKAT-O (Lee et al.,
2012) and multiple linear regression. SKAT is a variance compo-
nent test that allows variants with different direction of effects and
maintains power when variants in a unit are non-causal, but is less
powerful than the collapsing methods for variants with similar
effects; SKAT-O uses the data to optimally combine the collap-
sing test and the non-collapsing SKAT, but pays a penalty for
combining multiple methods in a single test (Lee et al., 2012).
These methods have been described and compared in Bacanu
et a]. (2012) and Basu and Pan (2011). The main difference be-
tween our methods and the previously existing ones is that our
Bayesian model comparison framework automatically incorpor-
ates information about the factors affecting power of the study
(such as the number of PTV carriers). We discuss how this affects
the ranking of genes within a study.

We apply our methods to unpublished sequence and exome-
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)—array data and find a
strong signal at APOC3 where PTVs lead to decreased plasma
triglyceride levels.

2 METHODS

Assume that among N individuals studied, n individuals carry one of the
k PTVs observed in a gene considered, typically n << N. Because PTVs

are typically rare, we will assume here that individuals carry at most one
such variant. (Two PTVs on the same chromosome are likely to have the
same effect as one PTV, and individuals with PTVs on both chromo-
somes could be treated either as a separate class or in the same class if a
dominant model were thought appropriate.) The same PTV might be
carried by several individuals.

We denote by Y1, . . . , YN the standardized quantitative trait values of
the individuals and assume that the trait values Y1, . . . , Yn correspond to
the carriers of PTVs and the values Yn+1, . . . , YN correspond to the non-
carriers of PTVs. We further assume that standardized trait values across
the whole sample follow a standard normal distribution. If necessary this
can be achieved by applying quantile normalization. If the PTV has a big
effect on the trait, individuals carrying PTVs might have extreme trait
values, which would be moved closer to the other values under quantile
normalization. In this setting, there is a potential loss of power through
quantile normalization, but we see this as being outweighed by the add-
itional robustness it provides. Outlying observations can occur for many
reasons aside from genetics (typically measurement errors), and the indi-
viduals who have these outlying observations will have PTVs at some
genes, so that in the context of a genome-wide analysis, failure to quantile
normalize can lead to a strong (false-positive) signal at the genes where
the individuals with the outlying observations have a PTV. Analogous
issues arise in Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for quantitative
traits where individuals with extreme trait values can contribute to a
strong signal at SNPs where they are called homozygous for a rare
variant.

Under the null model, the gene does not affect the trait, and hence the
trait values among both the PTV carriers and the PTV non-carriers
follow the standard normal distribution:

NULL:Y,~N(0,12), for i=1,2, 
Y,~N(0,12), forj=n+1,n+2, 

The statistical challenge is then in principle straightforward: one looks for
(strong) evidence against the null hypothesis. In effect, this reduces to
asking whether Y1, ..., Yn follow a standard normal distribution. (If
PTVs at the gene under consideration do affect trait values, this will
also cause a deviation from normality for Yn+1, . . . , YN, when the
entire sample is quantile normalized together, but because n << N, this
effect will be small, and we only look for evidence of departure from the
null at Y1, ..., Yn.)

One could adopt either a frequentist or a Bayesian statistical approach
to the problem. We consider both, but we see substantial advantages here
in adopting a Bayesian framework, for reasons we return to below.

The Bayesian approach requires speciﬁcation of the alternative hy-
pothesis. We ﬁrst consider the setting, which we call the similar effects
model (SEM), where all PTVs have the same effect on gene function, and
hence on the distribution of trait values.

2.1 Similar effects model

Under the SEM, we assume that the effect of a PTV is to shift the mean
of the distribution of trait values, so that the trait values of the PTV
carriers follow a normal distribution with mean p. and standard deviation
s, whereas the trait values for the remaining individuals follow a standard
normal distribution:

SEM:Y,-~N(}t,s2), fori: 1,2, ...,n
Yj~N(o,12), forj=n+1,n+2, 

In this work, we ﬁx the value of s = 1, but more general approaches could
also allow a change under the alternative hypothesis in the variance of
trait values, or potentially in their distribution. A change in variance
could be handled easily if a conjugate prior were used; because the
number of individuals with PTVs will typically be small, power to
detect a change in the distribution of trait values will be limited.

Association between protein truncating variants and quantitative traits

 

To complete the speciﬁcation of the alternative model, we must specify
the distribution of the trait mean 11. under the alternative hypothesis.
Because it will not usually be known in advance whether PTVs will in-
crease or decrease trait values, we use a 50:50 mixture of two normal
distributions as a prior for 11.:

Ni _ 2 l 2
M 2N(a.t)+2/\/(a.t).

We ﬁx the hyperparameters to a = 1.5 and t2 = 0.5. With these values,
95% of the prior mass for 1;. lies in the set (—2.89, — 0.12) U (012,289).

In a Bayesian framework, the appropriate way to compare the null and
alternative models is via the Bayes factor (BF) deﬁned as the ratio of the
probability densities of the observed data under the two models. In our
setting, the BF reduces to a ratio of densities involving only trait values of
the carriers of PTVs (YPTV 2 {Y1, . . . , Yn}) because under both models
the data on the non-carriers of PTVs have the same distribution.

where the index i runs through the index set I whose size is |I|.

2.2 Grouped effects model

In some biological contexts, different PTVs may have different effects on
the trait. For example, different PTVs can affect different transcript iso-
forms, either trigger or escape NMD, or act as dominant gain of function
variants, all of which have been observed in genes predisposing to cancer
(Futreal et al., 2004; Isidor et al., 2011; Ruark et al., 2013). To cater for
this setting, we extend our alternative model by allowing different groups
of PTVs to have different impacts on the trait.

Analysis of RNA sequencing data conﬁrms that transcripts with pre-
mature termination codons 50 bp upstream of the ﬁnal exonaexon junc-
tion escape NMD (Geuvadis RNA-Sequencing Project, unpublished
data). The mutant mRNA products may well lead to resulting truncated
proteins that act in a loss of function, or gain of function manner as
observed in NOTCHZ (Isidor et al., 2011) or have no impact on a trait.
A prudent thing to do is to have an alternative model where PTVs >50 bp
upstream of the ﬁnal exonaexon boundary could be placed in one of the
groups with all other PTVs in the other group. However, the limitation in
this setting is that it may well be the case that variants that escape NMD
have a similar effect on trait values as variants that trigger NMD, or have
no effect. We extend our alternative model and use biologically informed
weights to reﬂect this:

Let G be the set of all 2" possible assignments of the k PTVs into two
groups labelled + and —. For any grouping g e G, let I+(g) and L(g) be
the sets of indexes of the individuals who carry PTVs that g assigns to
groups+ and —, respectively. We deﬁne the model

GEM(g) IYt ~ N(it+,S2), for i E 1+(g)
Y,- ~ Muff), for i 6 Mg)
Y,- ~ N(0,12), forj>n.
Our priors are u+ ~ N(a,t2) and 11., ~ N(—a,t2), with a = 1.5 and
t2 = 0.5, and again we keep s=l ﬁxed. In other words, we assume
that the phenotype of an individual with a truncating variant in a relevant
gene will be towards the tails of the distribution.
The BF between GEM(g) and the null model is
3,, ( ) _ Pr(YlGEM(g)) _ Pr(YPerGEM(g))
GEM g _ Pr(YlNULL) _ Pr(YpTleULL)
_ fni61+@)f( Yilll+a52)f(l‘«+laa t2)dl‘«+
n..,,(,,f(Y,-io.12)

11,-.,,(,,f(Y,-10. 12)
= 31%, t, S. 1+(g)) X BF(-a, t,s,L(g))
We deﬁne the ﬁnal GEM as a linear combination of submodels

GEM(g) by choosing a weight wg 3 0 for each grouping g e G with
the constraint 2g wg = l. The corresponding BF is

BFGEM = ZWgBFGEM(g)-
gEG

 

 

 

Note that by giving a weight of 0.5 to each of the two groupings in
which all variants belong to the same group, and a weight of 0 to all other
groupings, we are back to the SEM.

We refer to the approach that uses biologically informed weights based
on NMD predictions as grouped effects model (GEM)-NMD. Let 11(10)
be the indexes of individuals carrying variants that are predicted to trigger
(escape) NMD. We deﬁne model GEM-NMD by using wg cc 1 for such
groupings g e G in which individuals in 11 and individuals in ID belong to
different groups and by using wg cc 2’ mm“’+(g)" "43” for other groupings.

In sequencing datasets even for current large experiments, the numbers
of PTVs in any gene will tend to be small, meaning that there are only few
data for distinguishing the null and alternative models. Use of the GEM
requires averaging over submodels corresponding to different assign-
ments of PTVs to groups. In the absence of good biological information
(such as escape or not from NMD as just described) to assign PTVs to
groups, or equivalently to heavily constrain the prior on submodels, the
averaging across submodels is likely to come at a considerable cost in
power in these settings. In our simulation study and application below,
we thus focus only on GEM-NMD, rather than the more general versions
of the GEM model.

Finally, we note that under GEM-NMD the averaging over submodels
described above maintains the symmetry in SEM: under the prior, the
probability that a particular group of PTVs increases trait values while
the other group decreases them is the same as the probability that the ﬁrst
group decreases trait values and the second increases them. This is
appropriate biologically because it will typically not be possible to predict
in advance, for example, whether loss of function mutations will cause an
increase or decrease in trait values. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the
prior and sampling distribution for SEM and GEM.

2.3 Other approaches

When expecting similar effects across the variants, a simple alternative to
our SEM is to use %(Z;':1 Y,-)2 as a test statistic (with x? distribution
under the null). We call this approach Collapse because it is similar in
spirit to the collapsing methods of Li and Leal (2008). Other methods that
we use in comparisons are the SKAT (Wu et al., 2011), with the default
weight parameters of Beta(l,25) for the linear weighted kernel and
Davies’ method to compute the P-value, SKAT-O (Lee et al., 2012)
using method: ‘optimal’ and multiple linear regression (1m) as

individuals.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulation study

3.1.] Comparison of SEM and Collapse For a fixed value of n,
both P-Value from Collapse and BFSEM (with s2 = 1) depend on
the data only through |Zy=l Y,- , and both show monotonically
increasing deviation from the null model with increasing
lZLl Yil. It follows that SEM (with s2 = 1) shares the frequen-
tist properties of Collapse, i.e. has the same power and produces
the same P-Values under the null if used as a test statistic.
However, a main difference between the methods is that this
similarity does not hold across genes with different numbers of
PTVs. Rankings across all genes in a study by BF and by P-Value
will in general be different, and for the reasons given in the
Discussion, ranking by BF is preferable.

Figure 2 provides an illustration of this effect. In it, the P-
value is ﬁxed at 0.001, and the ﬁgure plots, for different values of
n, both the mean value of the trait among PTV carriers and the
BF. Because the P-Value is ﬁxed, any gene with this combination
of n and mean trait value would have the same P-Value and
hence the same rank in the P—Value-based ranking. The ranking
by BF is lower for small n and for larger n, compared with
intermediate values of n. When n is small (say 1 or 2), there
are few observations of traits for PTV carriers, so limited
power to assess the null and alternative hypotheses. To achieve
a small P-Value, these observations need to be relatively large in
absolute value, but the Bayesian approach will downweight them
because of the limited amount of data, and the prior assumption
that changes of that magnitude in trait values for PTV carriers
are unlikely. The relative downweighting in the Bayesian ap-
proach of datasets with large n is for a different reason and is
related to Lindley’s paradox in statistics (Lindley, 1957). For
example, with n=50, the data correspond to a rather small

tive values) on mean effect size under SEM (not on scale)

change in mean trait values. The Bayesian approach compares
the probability of this under the null (closely related to the
P-Value) with the probability under the alternative, and it turns
out that this small change is also relatively unlikely under the
alternative (because the alternative assigns most of its mass to
larger changes in trait value), reducing the BF.

3.1.2 Critical values when the BF is used as a test statistic For
ease of use, we provide a table of critical values of the BF when it
is used as a frequentist test statistic. As mentioned previously, we
are able to evaluate the null distribution of BFSEM (with s2 = 1)
analytically, and hence to calculate critical values analytically.
For GEM-NMD, the same can be done by simulations.
Table 1 gives the critical value for the BF corresponding to the
type I error rates (a) of (i) 0.01, (ii) 0.001 and (iii) 0.0001, eval-
uated at different numbers of observed PTVs (n = 3, 4, 5).

3.1.3 Power comparisons We performed power comparisons
among the various frequentist approaches, including the use of
the BFs described above as frequentist test statistics.

First consider the scenario when all PTVs at a gene have the
same effect on the trait, as would be expected for typical ‘loss of
function’ variants. To assess this, we simulated 375 PTVs each
seen in a single individual. Trait values for PTV carriers were
drawn from an N(2, 1) distribution, and the remaining trait
values for a total of 2000 trait observations were drawn from
an N(0, 1). For this scenario (Table 2), the most powerful meth-
ods are our SEM and Collapse, which, as explained above, have
exactly the same power. SKAT-O (Lee et al., 2012) comes next,
and the power is the lowest for SKAT (Wu et al., 2011) and
linear regression.

In the second scenario, we assumed that PTVs in a gene con-
tribute to trait variance and can have an effect in opposite dir-
ections, with the direction of effect speciﬁed by the impact of

Note: For GEM—NMD, thresholds for the given type I error rate are given in
Table l.

NMD (Table 2). In our simulation of this scenario, trait values
were drawn from an N(—2, 1) distribution for individuals with a
copy of a variant predicted to trigger NMD, and N(2, 1) for
individuals with a copy of a variant predicted to escape NMD
and N(0, 1) otherwise (one variant was selected to escape
NMD). Not surprisingly, GEM-NMD, which uses information
on NMD, is clearly the most powerful model. Next comes SKAT
and linear regression, then SKAT-O and last SEM and Collapse,
which have almost no power in this scenario. In addition, we
included a weighted version of SKAT (SKATw) in the power
comparisons. For the variants predicted to trigger NMD, we
assigned a weight of ﬂ, and for the variants predicted to
escape NMD, we assigned a weight of 1. This approach ranks
below SKAT-O but above Collapse and SEM.

There may be scenarios in which a putative variant is errone-
ously labelled as a PTV, for example, because of a sequencing
artifact or an incorrect annotation. In these settings, our
approach will lose power. To illustrate this, we focus on the
SEM and simulations applied in Table 2. We assume that one
of the n : 3, 4, 5 PTVs is actually a sequencing artifact and that

the trait value of the corresponding individual is drawn from
a standard normal distribution. In this case, power to detect
the association decreases to 13,35 and 55% for n:3, 4, 5,
respectively.

3.2 Application of the method to plasma triglyceride levels
and truncating variant data from the Genetics of Type
2 Diabetes study and Oxford Biobank study

We applied the proposed approach to exome-sequencing data
from the Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes (GoT2D) study and
plasma triglyceride levels. The dataset consisted of 2760 T2D
cases and control individuals of Northern European descent.
Exome target capture was performed with the Agilent
SureSelect Human All Exon hybrid selection kit and sequence
obtained on HiSeq. Subsequent alignment and allele calling used
Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin, 2010) and
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (DePristo et al., 2011) gen-
erating 688 731 variants that passed quality control and were
included in the analysis.

To illustrate the performance of our models, we focus here on
data for APOC3 for which a null mutation p.R19X has previ-
ously been implicated to be associated to plasma lipid proﬁle and
apparent cardioprotection (Hoﬁ<er, 2010; Pollin et al., 2008).
Variant annotation in using the pyplinkseq library (part of
PLINK/SEQ toolset [http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/plinkseq/]
and MAMBA dependency), identiﬁes two candidate PTVs pre-
dicted to trigger NMD: the previously mentioned stop-gain mu-
tation, p.R19X (MAF : 0.00025, allele count: 1), and a donor
essential splice variant c.IVS2+1G >A (MAF:0.002, allele
count: 8). After application of the SEM to the data, the poster-
ior distribution indicates that plasma triglyceride levels of indi-
viduals with PTVs at APOC3 are 1.2 standard deviations (SD)
lower than the population mean, indicating a strong effect
(Fig. 3). The effects of the splice and the stop-gain variants
are at 1.19 and 1.44 SD below the population mean, respectively
(BF for SEM : 63.44). The splice variant explains 0.29% of the
trait variance in our data, whereas the null mutation explains
0.04% of the trait variance. To compare with other methods,
we applied (i) Collapse, (ii) SKAT, (iii) SKAT-O and (iv) mul-
tiple linear regression to the data (Table 3). We ﬁnd that our
models, Collapse and SKAT-O give similar results (as measured
by P-Value), whereas SKAT and 1m give clearly larger P-Values,
probably because they are not assuming similar effect sizes across
the two variants. When we compare the ranks of genes in an
exome-wide analysis, the SEM and SKAT rank APOC3 as #3
and #5, respectively.

We were able to confirm these effects using Illumina exome
array genotyping in the Oxford Biobank cohort (n: 4443 sam-
ples, [http://www.oxfordbiobank.org.uk]). Quantiﬁcation of
plasma triglyceride concentrations in the Oxford Biobank was
made after an overnight fast. Combined analysis of plasma tri-
glyceride levels and variant genotype data for c.IVS2+ 1G >A
(allele count: 3) and p.R19X (allele count: 31) from the
Oxford Biobank cohort and the GoT2D samples demonstrates
strong supporting evidence for protein truncating variant associ-
ation to low plasma triglyceride levels (BF for SEM : 8 x 108).
The combined posterior effect size for c.IVS2+1G >A and
p.R19X is 1.23 and 1.66 SD below the mean, respectively.

4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Application of the method

Larger BFs correspond to stronger evidence in favour of the
alternative hypothesis over the null. The BF calculated in our
approach has a direct interpretation as the way in which the data
changes the weight, which should be given to the null and alter-
native hypotheses. Formally, the posterior odds (i.e. in the light
of the data) on the alternative hypothesis can be calculated by
multiplying the prior odds (i.e. before the data) by the BF.

We envisage that a primary application of this and similar
methods will be in the analysis of quantitative traits measured
in individuals for whom whole— genome or whole-exome sequence
data are available, or perhaps for whom genetic data are ob-
tained from an exome-SNP-array.

For a single dataset one could use the size of the BF to indicate
the strength of the evidence in favour of the alternative hypoth-
esis. It can also be helpful to plot the posterior distribution on the
mean trait value for individuals carrying PTVs.

Many studies will consist of two phases, discovery and repli-
cation. In this setting, analyses of the discovery data would aim
to rank genes for follow-up according to the evidence for depart-
ures from the null hypothesis at that gene. In such a ranking
exercise, the use of BFs has considerable advantages over the
use of P-Values. The interpretation of a P-Value obtained in a
particular experiment depends on both the alternative hypothesis
and the power of the statistical method used. In the current con-
text, power will change with n, the number of PTVs observed at
the gene: there will be more power to reject the null hypothesis
(for a speciﬁc alternative hypothesis) at genes that happen to
have more PTVs in the sample, and as a consequence, infor-
mally, a low P-Value will be more informative for a gene with
more PTVs than the same P-Value would be for a gene with
fewer PTVs. For this reason, simple ranking of genes by
P-Value is unlikely to be optimal. In contrast, BFs quantify the
evidence for the alternative hypothesis as compared with the null
(P-Values only measure tail probabilities under the null), so can
be compared naturally even for genes with different numbers of
PTVs.

Although we see advantages in adopting a Bayesian perspec-
tive, our approach could be used in a frequentist context by
calculating the BF and using this as a frequentist test statistic.
Conditional on the number of PTV carriers at the gene, n, a P-
value can then be obtained by asking for the probability, under
the null hypothesis, of obtaining the same or a larger BF than the
one actually calculated from the data. Under the SEM, the null
distribution of the BF can be calculated explicitly, allowing a
simple analytic computation of P-Values. For more complicated
alternative hypotheses, P-Values can be obtained easily by simu-
lation under the null.

In the SEM setting, the statistical problem is a simple one,
namely, of detecting a mean shift in a (typically small) number
of observations. Our method is the obvious Bayesian approach
to the problem, and when the resulting BF is used as a test
statistic it is effectively equivalent to the obvious frequentist ap-
proach. We have, necessarily, used particular prior distributions
for the change in mean trait value caused by the PTVs. In our
method these are relatively broad, but they could be adjusted as
our biological knowledge grows, as could the priors in the GEM

Association between protein truncating variants and quantitative traits

 

model. As more genes are discovered where PTVs affect quanti-
tative traits, the priors could be informed by knowledge of the
effect sizes of PTVs at these genes. Two caveats are appropriate
here. The ﬁrst is that early discoveries are likely to correspond to
genes where PTVs have larger effects, and the second is that a
more precise speciﬁcation of the prior will gain power if it reﬂects
reality but could substantially lose power otherwise.

What are the sample sizes required to obtain exome-wide
significant results? Under the assumption that effect sizes are 2,
1.5 and 1 SDs from the mean, to get a P-Value of 2.5 x 10’6
(where 2.5 x 10’6 is obtained by Bonferroni correction:0.05/
number of genes), using the SEM would require 8, 14 and 31
PTV carriers, respectively, to achieve 80% power to detect the
association. PTV frequencies are likely to vary orders of magni-
tude between genes, and our current understanding is that only
a limited number of genes have a low frequency (>0.1%)
PTV, whereas in most genes any single PTV will be private or
extremely rare. If a fraction 10"“ of the population
(k : 2,3,4, ...) carries a PTV at a particular gene, then we
need to sample ~1.0 x 101+k, 1.7 x 101+,“ or 3.6 x 101+,“ individ-
uals to achieve 80% probability of ﬁnding at least 8, 14 or 31 PTV
carriers at that gene, respectively.

As we generate more cellular genomics data, we will improve
our understanding of the impact of PTVs on gene function. For
example, combining DNA and RNA sequence data will enable
better predictions of mechanisms underlying NMD, which will,
in turn, give more accurate predictions of the biological conse-
quences that the analyzed variants may have. Current annotation
of loss of function variants is based on some reference transcript
set, for example, GENCODE (Harrow et al., 2012), and selection
of variants mapping within the units to include is chosen from
the most deleterious annotation across all transcripts. Transcript
quantiﬁcations for the relevant tissue or cell types will enable
better annotation and selection of rare variants for combining
in statistical analyses. Thus, now is a good time to think about
how this knowledge can be used in future data analyses. Our
Bayesian framework provides one way to do this, and we hope
that it will stimulate research on both the methodological aspects
of these models and on the enhanced prior speciﬁcation based
on biological knowledge.

5 CONCLUSION

We have developed and studied a novel statistical method for
assessing the association between PTVs and a quantitative trait.
The approach is formulated in a Bayesian statistical framework,
and can be used in a Bayesian framework or in providing a test
statistic for frequentist application. Bayesian application is rec-
ommended in ranking genes for follow-up in a discovery dataset.
The frequentist application allows calculation of P-Values for
association, which can be helpful in settings where these are
required.

We have presented two versions of the method. In the first,
SEM, all PTVs are assumed to have effects in the same direction.
This would be appropriate, for example, if all PTVs were thought
to result in loss of function of that copy of the gene. We also
described a more general version of the approach allowing
different classes of PTV in terms of their effect on trait values.
We see the major application of this more general method in

taking a more nuanced View of the consequences of PTVs, and
distinguishing between those likely to be subjected to NMD and
those that escape NMD (e. g. many or all PTVs in the last exon of
the gene) and may result in gain of function. As our biological
understanding of the NMD mechanism increases, we expect that
it will add power to allow potentially different effects for PTVs
escaping NMD, for example, by applying GEM-NMD (in which
they may have similar effects or different effects) and SEM (in
which their effect on the trait would be the same, even though the
molecular consequences of the mutation would be different).

Finally, we have established and replicated an association
between PTVs in APOC3 and lowering of plasma triglyceride
levels.

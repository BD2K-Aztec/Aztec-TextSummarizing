Abstract

Motivation: Phosphoproteomics measurements are widely applied in cellular biology to detect
changes in signalling dynamics. However, due to the inherent complexity of phosphorylation pat—
terns and the lack of knowledge on how phosphorylations are related to functions, it is often not
possible to directly deduce protein activities from those measurements. Here, we present a heuris—
tic machine learning algorithm that infers the activities of kinases from Phosphoproteomics data
using kinase—target information from the PhosphoSitePlus database. By comparing the estimated
kinase activity profiles to the measured phosphosite profiles, it is furthermore possible to derive
the kinases that are most likely to phosphorylate the respective phosphosite.

Results: We apply our approach to published datasets of the human cell cycle generated from
HeLaS3 cells, and insulin signalling dynamics in mouse hepatocytes. In the first case, we estimate
the activities of 118 at six cell cycle stages and derive 94 new kinase—phosphosite links that can be
validated through either database or motif information. In the second case, the activities of 143 kin—
ases at eight time points are estimated and 49 new kinase—target links are derived.

Availability and implementation: The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and be downloaded
from github. It makes use of the Optimization and Statistics toolboxes. https://github.com/marcel—

logues and characterizes proteins containing a phosphate group as a
post—translational modification. Since intracellular signal transduc—
tion is primarily mediated by the reversible phosphorylation of vari—
ous signalling molecules, data generated by phosphoproteomics
approaches is commonly used to study the dynamics of signalling
networks (Kirkpatrick et (11., 2013; Xia et (11., 2013; Zimman et (11.,
2014). A major challenge in the analysis of such data lies in the high
combinatorial complexity of the observed signalling networks. The

(Hornbeck et (11., 2012; Manning, 2005). Hence, the number of pos—
sible targets per kinase tends to be high, and the majority of proteins
acting as kinase—targets can be phosphorylated at multiple sites,
where each site can potentially be targeted by several kinases, result—
ing in an intricate network of kinases, target proteins and phosphat—
ases, which remove the attached phosphorylations again. Both
kinases and phosphatases can thereby themselves be phosphory—
lated. The situation gets further complicated by the fact that most

known phosphosites can so far not be related to a distinct protein
function. Thus, most research up to the present focuses on individ—
ual phosphoproteins and kinases or is restricted to clustering and en—
richment methods which group the detected sites according to their
behaviour and relate the proteins they are localized on to cellular
processes like canonical pathways, transcriptional networks or dis—
ease mechanisms via statistical testing against databases (Liu and
Chance, 2014). Modelling of phosphoproteomics networks is usu—
ally limited to few components (<50) and rather includes single
phosphosites than whole proteins due to the lack of functional infor—
mation (Terfve et (11., 2012).

To address these challenges, we developed the machine algo—
rithm IKAP (Inference of kinase activities from phosphoproteomics)
that estimates the activities of all kinases that are known to phos—
phorylate at least one phosphosite in a phosphoproteomics dataset.
IKAP takes information from the PhosphoSitePlus (PSP) database as
input and uses a non—linear optimization routine to minimize a cost
function that relates kinase activities and affinities to phosphosite
measurements. The predicted activities directly display the engage—
ment of signal transduction pathways such as cAMP/PKA,
Capt/PKG, MTOR or Akt kinase pathways. If data for multiple
time points or conditions are available, each kinase receives a unique
activity profile which depicts the change of cellular function over all
conditions. Furthermore, these profiles can be used as an input for
mathematical modelling which enables the usage of protein nodes
instead of phosphosite nodes, making the model more meaningful
and predictive. Another application lies in the inference of possible
new kinase—target links. By correlating the calculated kinase activity
profiles to the measured phosphosite profiles the kinases that are
most likely to phosphorylate a respective phosphosite can be
derived.

To demonstrate the capabilities of IKAP, we applied it to two
previously published phosphoproteomics datasets. The first com—
prises a study of the human cell cycle in HeLaS3 cells (Olsen et (11.,
2010). Eukaryotic cells replicate by a complex series of evolutionar—
ily conserved events that tightly regulate defined stages of the cell
division cycle. Progression through this cycle involves a large num—
ber of dedicated protein complexes and signalling pathways, and de—
regulation of this process is implicated in tumourigenesis. Global
analyses of transcriptome dynamics during the cell cycle have been
performed in microarray studies. However, in addition to changes in
messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance, protein phosphorylation and
targeted protein degradation are also important regulators of cell
cycle progression. To examine the inﬂuence of protein phosphoryl—
ations on the progression of the cell cycle, the phosphoproteome
was measured through a combination of immobilized metal affinity
chromatography (Macek et (11., 2009) and stable isotope labelling of
amino acids (Ong et al., 2002) at the six phases G1, G1—S, early—S,
late—S, G2 and M. Further details can be found in Olsen et al.
(2010).

The second dataset is a study of insulin signalling dynamics in
the mouse liver (Humphrey et (11., 2015). Here, the phosphopro—
teome was measured after 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10min after
stimulation with insulin.

2 Methods

The algorithm consists of a set of Matlab functions that have to be
sequentially executed. The package including explanations for use
can be found in the Supplementary Material and in our code reposi—
tory at github. All scripts were written in Matlab R2014b, but were
tested on earlier versions down to R2012a. The algorithm makes

use of functions from the Optimization and Statistics toolboxes for
parameter estimation and statistical analysis. It is divided into three
parts, where in the first part kinase activities and affinity parameters
are estimated from the measured data using known interactions, in
the second the calculated kinase profiles are used to infer possible
new kinase—target links, which are validated through database,
motif and literature information in the third part. All experimental
methods can be found in Olsen et al. (2010).

2.1 Part 1: estimation of kinase activities

The algorithm assumes as an input a data sheet consisting of protein
or gene names, the sequences of the measured peptides and t col—
umns with data values.

1. The first function performs a PSP database search for all se—
quences in the dataset and outputs the kinases that are known to
phosphorylate each sequence in a column next to the data values.
The PSP database (Kinase—substrate dataset) can be downloaded
from httpz//www.phosphosite.org/staticDownloads.do.

2. In the next step, the kinases found can be filtered by prote—
omics data to ensure only those kinases that are present in the cell
type under investigation are included. This step is optional.
Afterwards, the original dataset is filtered for those phosphosites
that have at least one annotated kinase in PSP which is present in
the proteome. If no proteome data is available, the filtering is done
with respect to all kinases from the first step. We end up with a
reduced dataset data_red and the string array kin that contains the
kinase names.

3. The third step generates a truth table for the kinase—
phosphosite interactions in the reduced dataset. It produces the n X
m matrix A with A(i,j) 6 {0,1}, 71 being the number of phosphosites
in the reduced dataset and m the number of kinases in kin.

4. Now that we have produced data_red, kin and A, we can use
these variables to perform the optimization task of finding the kin—
ase activities which best explain our data. In the most simple case,
the activity [2 of kinase 1 at time point i can be defined as the product
of the kinase’s abundance a, which is mostly known by proteomics
data, and its mobilization m, which is dependent on post—
translational regulation.

kit :ali*mli- (1)

The effect e a certain kinase has on a phosphosite / can in turn be
regarded as the product of its activity and the affinity p the kinase
has to the respective phosphosite.

€in : klji * 1711- (2)

Thus, we can define the value of phosphosite / as the mean of all
effects acting on it. Since the affinities of various kinases to phos—
phosite / are different and both activities and affinities would be—
come structurally non—identifiable if calculated for one single
condition, the mean is computed by dividing the summed effects by
the sum of affinities instead of the number of kinases. Hence, opti—
mization is done by minimizing the cost function

parameters

phosphosites are modelled at a given time point. The affinity param—
eters are optimized globally with respect to all measured time points,
whereas the kinase activities are estimated for each time point separ—
ately. The function makes use of the Matlab built—in function fmin-
con which is part of the Optimization toolbox and uses a trust
region related routine to find a parameter set that minimizes our
cost function (3) applying parameter bounds. Bounds were set to 0
and 50. Besides the model—to—data—distance of a given parameter set,
Step 4 also calculates the parameters’ gradients, which are then for—
warded to fmincon. In addition to the variables data_red, kin and A,
a fourth input is the desired number of iterations. Since for each iter—
ation, the starting values for both kinase activities and affinity par—
ameters are randomized, a higher number of iterations yields a
better coverage of the parameter space and thus a better chance to
find the global optimum. The outputs of Step 4 are the arrays K and
AP which contain the optimal kinase activities and affinities as well
as the minimal cost.

5. In this optional step, we test the identifiability of the calcu—
lated activities. This is done by exploring the )8 space along the di—
mension of the respective kinase activity. If the resulting profile
exhibits a minimum, the activity is identifiable on the basis of the
measured data.

2.2 Part 2: inference of kinase—target links

In this part, the calculated activity profiles are applied to infer the
most likely kinases for each phosphosite by means of correlation
coefficients.

Our assumption is that the phosphorylation state of a site is cor—
related to the activity of the kinase that dominates the phosphoryl—
ation of this site. In case of one dominating kinase for a site the
phosphorylation state of the site and the activity of the kinase result
in a high correlation coefficient. A high and significant correlation
therefore points to a kinase—substrate link. In case of sites that are
phosphorylated by several different kinases, the phosphosphoryla—
tion time profile is the sum of the activity profiles of these kinases. If
the contributions of the kinases to the phosphorylation of the sites
are in a similar range a correlation will be less obvious. It should be
pointed out, however, that the sum of the activity profiles of one set
of kinases might mimic the activity profile of other kinases.
Potentially, this could lead to the detection of false positive kinase—
substrate links.

1. Using the function ComputeDistances, we calculated P—values
for all kinase—phosphosite pairs in the complete dataset by

computing the correlation coefficient between the estimated kinase
profiles and the measured phosphosite values. The function gener—
ates the n X m matrix dist. Each entry represents a P—value for the
respective kinase—target interaction indicating the probability of get—
ting a correlation as large as the observed value by random chance,
when the true correlation is zero. Since not every phosphosite has a
valid measurement value at all applied conditions, the function also
outputs a vector containing the number of valid values for all phos—
phosites. This can be important when comparing the different P—val—
ues to each other.

2. The second step generates the cell array psig, which includes
all significant kinase—phosphosite links and their respective P—values,
taking the newly produced distance matrix dist, the kinase list kin
and the desired false discovery rate as an input.

2.3 Part 3: validation functions

Now that we have derived the most likely kinases for each phospho—
site, we validate the newly found interactions by means of database
information from IPA (QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/
ingenuity) and MetaBase (Thomson Reuters, http://thomsonreuters.
com/metabase) as well as motif information from NetworKIN
(Horn et al., 2014). Since the latter is based on the STRING data—
base, this also covers publicly available information at this point.
Before we start to validate our links, Part 2 should be repeated with
a dataset from which the pairs in the reduced dataset are removed to
guarantee for an unbiased validation. This can be done by the op—
tional function MakeDataVal, which produces datazval.

1. This step produces a list pnsig which has the same size as psig
and contains randomly taken kinase—phosphosite links for comparison.

2. To validate our significant links, we established a list of all
kinase—target links which are present in the IPA and MetaBase data—
bases. Those links are not phosphosite—specific but rather limited to
interactions of kinases with entire proteins. However, if a certain
kinase—protein link can be found in the databases and a phosphosite
located on that protein has a low IKAP P—value with respect to the
respective kinase, the interaction is likely to be realized within the
investigated cell type. The function compares the database list with
both psig and pnsig, counts the agreements and calculates a P—value
by means of a fisher exact test. Since pnsig has been generated ran—
domly, Steps 1 and 2 should be repeated several times with taking
the mean of all obtained P—values.

3. The second validation consists in checking the likelihood of
the found interactions in a motif—based manner via NetworKIN
(Horn et al., 2014), which is an integrated platform for modelling
kinase signalling networks by combining sequence specificity with
cellular context from the STRING database (Franceschini et al.,
2012). Thus, here we replenish our database validation from Step 4
by publicly available resources. This is again done for both psig and
pnsig. In this case, the algorithm calculates two different P—values.
The first is based on the summed likelihoods of all links in psig and
pnsig, respectively, and the second is computed on the number of
significant likelihoods (21) in both lists. Both P—values are derived
by a fisher exact test.

3.1 Calculation of kinase activities and most likely pairs
We started our analysis with the HeLaS3 phosphoproteome data
(Supplementary Material, original data mit.xls) taken from Olsen
et al. (2010) and the mouse liver data taken from Humphrey et al.
(2015) (Supplementary Material, data—mit.mat).

IKAP: A heuristic framework for inference of kinase activities from Phosphoproteomics data 427

 

In the case of HeLaS3 data, where proteomics measurements
were available, the measured phosphopeptide values are normalized
with respect to the corresponding changes in protein abundance to
determine changes in phosphorylation state rather than changes in
protein abundance. Here, all values are given as log and lie within
the interval [—15,15]. The data contains 24 714 phosphosites in
total which were measured at the six cell cycle stages G1, G1/S, early
S, late S, G2 and M. Figure 2 depicts the overall workﬂow.

By applying IKAP Part 1, we at first obtained a reduced dataset
comprising 1069 phosphosites for which at least one kinase is
known from PSP. Filtering of the obtained kinases by proteomics led
to a list comprising 118 kinases which are expressed in HeLaS3 and
known to phosphorylate a peptide in our dataset at the respective
position. By applying Step 4 with an iteration number of 100, we
estimated the activities of these 118 kinases within the six cell cycle
stages. As quoted before, affinity parameters were estimated glo—
bally with respect to all six conditions, whereas kinase activities
were fitted for each condition separately. Parameter bounds were set
to 0.1 and 10 for affinity parameters and —15 and 15 for activities.
The latter thus lie in the same range as the phosphosite measure—
ments. To match units and for the sake of clarity, we can modify
Equation (1) to:

namics data (i.d.). In Part1, kinase activities and affinity parameters were esti-
mated. Part 2 comprises the search for new kinase—target links via
correlation-derived P—value. In Part 3, the newly found links are validated by
database and motif information

The mobilization factor m is now comparable to a raw phospho—
site value. However, since we estimate k, the algorithm is not af—
fected by this change.

Fitting led to an overall xz/N value of 1.22 for N : 6414 data
points (1069 phosphosites at 6 conditions) and 1777 parameters
[1584 affinities and 708 kinase activities (118 kinases at 6 condi—
tions)], using a SD of 1.5.

Table 1 shows the five most and least active kinases at each cell
cycle stage. In all stages, we see at least one member of the MAP—
kinase pathway among the five most up—regulated kinases. This sug—
gests this pathway to be particularly active in HeLaS3 cells. In
Figure 3, the mean kinase activity is displayed. We can see that the
overall kinase activity is highest at G1 and G2, and lowest during
the S and M phases, which is what we would expect (Fig. 3A).

IKAP Part 2.1 produces a distance matrix which displays P—val—
ues for all kinase—phosphosite pairs. Step 2.2 finally shows all sig—
nificant pairs (2684 with false discovery rate : 0.05). Figure 4
exemplary depicts the profiles of CDK1, CDK4, GRK5 and NEK2,
each along with one of their most likely targets. An activity value of
zero indicates no post—translational regulation to be present. Here,
the mobilization factor is zero. Higher activity values imply a post—
translational up—regulation, whereas lower values suggest a post—
translational down—regulation. The activity of CDK1 is high during
mitosis but low during S phase (Fig. 4A), which is what we would
expect (Morgan et al., 2007; Pruitt et al., 2014). CDK4 on the other
hand shows its highest activity in G1 followed by a drop and a se—
cond onset in late S phase (Fig. 4B). Here, we would expect a single
peak within the G1 and S phases (Morgan et al., 2007; Pruitt et al.,
2014) indicating that cell cycle control is altered in HeLaS3 cells.
The GRK5 protein phosphorylates the activated forms of G protein—
coupled receptors thus initiating their deactivation. Its activity
should be highest within the G1 phase and lowest during the S—phase
(Pruitt et al., 2014), which is confirmed by our approach (Fig. 4C).
NEK2 is a protein which localizes to the centrosome, and is un—
detectable during G1 phase, but accumulates progressively through—
out the S phase (Pruitt et al., 2014), which is consistent with our
model as well (Fig. 4D). All kinase activations can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

In the insulin signalling dataset, a total of 9782 phosphosites
was measured with respect to eight time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
and 10min after stimulation with insulin). The values are given as
log and lie within the interval [0,50]. IKAP Part 1 leads to a
reduced dataset containing 487 phosphosites for which a kinase is
known and 143 kinases that are known to phosphorylate at least
one site in the data (Steps 1 and 2). After calculating the truth table
(Step 3), the kinase activities and affinity parameters were estimated
with an iteration number of 100 (Step 4). For affinity parameters,
we chose the same bounds as for the mitosis experiment (0.1 and
10), whereas bounds for kinase activities were set to 0 and 50 to
match the range of measured values. Here, no proteome normaliza—
tion was performed and Equation (1) stays in its basic form. Fitting
led to an overall xz/N value of 1.51 for N : 3896 data points (487
phosphosites at 8 time points) and 2095 parameters [951 affinities
and 1144 kinase activities (143 kinases at 8 time points)], using a
SD of 2.

The five most and least active kinases at each time point com—
pared with baseline are given in Table 2. After 30 s and 1 min, we
see a strong increase in the activity of Nemo—like—kinase, which is an
atypical member of the MAPK family. Its activation mechanism and
downstream targets are still not well characterized. Thus, it could be
an interesting target of further investigations. TBK1, whose activity
rises after 1 min, can mediate NFKB activation in response to certain

growth factors. This result suggests a crosstalk between the classical
insulin receptor and the NFKB pathway and could be another re—
warding target for future experiments. The insulin receptor shows
up among the 10 mostly up—regulated kinases at all examined time
points, which is what we would expect. The strongest down—regula—
tion affects kinases which are involved in cytoskeletal rearrange—
ments, like MYLK, ROCK2 and LIMK2.

In Figure 3B, the mean kinase activity is plotted in dependence of
time. The trajectory shows a biphasic behaviour with a first peak
after 2 min and a second after 6 min. This could be due to autocrine
signalling or other time—delayed feedback—loops.

tion, followed by a return to basal levels. Thus, insulin seems to
have a rather short lasting effect in murine hepatocytes.

3.2 ldentifiability analysis

To test whether the optimization results are unique, we performed
an identifiability analysis by means of profile likelihood examin—
ation (Raue et al., 2009). For each condition and each kinase, the
computed kinase activity was increased and decreased in a stepwise
manner. The new value was then fixed and the other parameters re—
optimized to get an impression of the  landscape along the dimen—
sion of the respective kinase activity. All kinase activities displayed a
minimum within the x2 space and were thus found to be identifiable.
Figure 6 exemplary shows the x2 profiles of the kinases CDK1,
CDK4, GRK5 and NEK2 at G1 of the HeLaS3 dataset (Fig. 6A) and
of AKT1, MAPK1, MTOR and TBK1 at 0.5 min of the mouse liver
dataset. In some cases, like the CDK5, an activity increase has more
severe effects than a decrease, whereas in other cases, like NEK2,
the activity can vary within a certain interval without larger effects.

3.3 Validation
By exerting IKAP Part 3, we validated our approach through litera—
ture and motif information. After producing the lists psig and
pnsig, we tested both lists against all known kinase—target pairs of
the IPA and MetaBase databases and computed a P—value by apply—
ing a fisher exact test to the number of hits in both lists (Step 2 IKAP
Part 3). This was done five times, each time varying the list pnsig.
In the HeLaS3 example, the number of hits for psig turned out to be
42 out of 2684, whereas the average number of hits for pnsig was
just 2 out of 2684. This led to a P—value of 9.7278"'10’11 (pDB Mit,
Table 3). In the mouse liver example, psig showed 33 hits out of
3599 significant kinase—target pairs. Compared with pnsig, this
leads to a P—value of 1.3605’i10’5 (pDB Ins). Estimating kinase ac—
tivity profiles and correlating those to phosphosite measurements
thus produces a significantly higher amount of literature—known kin—
ase—target pairs than taking random combinations of kinases and
targets.

Step 3 finally utilizes the amino acid sequence of the phosphory—
lated peptide to infer a likelihood for the kinase—target pair under

turned out to be 2.5661"'10’28 whereas pNUM came down to
8.8961"'10’12 for the HeLaS3 example. For the mouse liver ex—
ample, motif validation led to P—values of 0.0179 (pSUM Ins) and
0.0013 (pNUM Ins). Even though these are substantially higher
than those for the HeLaS3 data, applying an alpha of 0.05 for the
fisher exact test leads to significant test results in all cases. Thus, on
the basis of sequence information the kinase—target links identified
by our algorithm are substantially more likely than random pairs.
To replenish our validation through findings that are not included in
one of the three databases but nonetheless appear in literature, we
performed a Linguamatics search (Bandy et al., 2009) for both psig
and pnsig links. This led us to 216 vs 122 hits resulting in a P—value
(pLIN) of 1.4694’i10’7. If a significance level of 0.01 is applied, all
four P—values lie far below this threshold, indicating the algorithm

to be beneficial. However, since the algorithm relies on correlations
of the time courses of single kinases and phosphosites, whereas in
the cell the time profile of a phosphosite is likely to be the result of
several kinases phosphorylating it, the method can only capture
those links where one kinase is predominant. In addition, it should
be remarked that the overall coverage of significant links and vali—

by the algorithm should therefor in the first place be regarded as
guidelines for experimental verification. Nevertheless, we regarded
a statistical validation of newly found kinase—target links to be a
more reasonable means of verification than a comparison of kinase
activities to autophosphorylation sites, since on the one hand in
the most of all cases they can be phosphorylated by several other
kinases as well, and on the other the activity of a kinase is a function
of all its sites.

4 Discussion

Phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine plays significant
roles in cellular signal transduction and in modifying multiple pro—
tein functions. Phosphoproteins are coordinated and regulated by a
network of kinases, phosphatases and phospho—binding proteins,
which modify the phosphorylation states, recognize unique phos—
phopeptides or target proteins for degradation. Detailed and com—
plete information on the structure and dynamics of these networks
is required to better understand fundamental mechanisms of cellular
processes and diseases. High—throughput technologies have been de—
veloped to investigate phosphoproteomes in model organisms and
human diseases. Among them, mass spectrometry—based technolo—
gies are the major platforms and have been widely applied, which
has led to explosive growth of phosphoproteomic data in recent
years. New bioinformatics tools are needed to analyse and make
sense of these data. Moreover, most research has focused on individ—
ual phosphoproteins and kinases. To gain a more complete know—
ledge of cellular processes, systems biology approaches, including
pathways and networks modelling, have to be applied to integrate
all components of the phosphorylation machinery, including kin—
ases, phosphatases, their substrates and phospho—binding proteins.

We developed here a machine—learning algorithm that estimates
the activities of all kinases which are known to phosphorylate se—
quences occurring in a phosphoproteomics dataset. The algorithm
thus reduces the dimensions of the parameter space to the number of
kinases, and renders the data easier to display and analyse. The esti—
mated activities can then be used for modelling or inference of new
kinase—target links.

Previous approaches to infer kinase activities from phosphopro—
teomic data only rely on the number of targets in the sample, with—
out taking the detected amounts of phosphorylation into account
(Qi et al., 2014), or solely deliver relative activities from one condi—
tion to another (Casado et al., 2013) and do not include affinity par—
ameters for kinase—target interactions. IKAP however calculates the
absolute activities for each condition separately and thus provides a
more precise picture of pathway engagement in biological samples.
Furthermore, in opposition to previous approaches, an arbitrary

number of kinases can be assigned to each phosphosite, which makes
the approach more realistic compared with sorting phosphosites into
distinct kinase groups and considers uncertainties in kinase specific—
ities for certain targets. Especially in the case of time—resolved data the
computed kinase activities are directly applicable as an input to subse—
quent dynamical modelling. The calculated affinities can thereby be
used as starting points for parameter calibration, and through the use
of identifiability analysis it is possible to determine how reliable the
computed activities are. The derivation of novel kinase—target pairs as
it is described in (Imamura et al., 2014) is an in vitro method that has
to be performed for each kinase individually. Thus, it is much more
time consuming. Furthermore, IKAP provides a ready—to—use frame—
work, whereas previous approaches need to be implemented by the
user from scratch.

Although the approach does not include phosphatases,
both the estimated kinase activities and the newly derived links
proved to be reliable in literature— and motif—based validation.
Our conclusion is that, at least in HeLaS3 cells and murine hepato—
cytes, phosphatase activity could rather be considered as a factor
which removes phosphorylations at a constant rate than a mechan—
ism which is under sophisticated regulation. Since this can be differ—
ent in other cell types, the findings that are generated through the
application of our method should always be critically appraised and
validated. The algorithm represents a step towards a system—wide
understanding of signal transduction processes within a cell. In the
near future, we will further test it on other phosphoproteomics data—
sets and implement versions in other programming languages like
Python and R to make it available to a larger community of
scientists.

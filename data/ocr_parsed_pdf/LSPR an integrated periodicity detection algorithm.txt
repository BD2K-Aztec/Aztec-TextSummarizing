ABSTRACT

Summary: We propose a three-step periodicity detection algorithm
named LSPR. Our method first preprocesses the raw time-series
by removing the linear trend and filtering noise. In the second
step, LSPR employs a Lomb—Scargle periodogram to estimate the
periodicity in the time-series. Finally, harmonic regression is applied
to model the cyclic components. Inferred periodic transcripts are
selected by a false discovery rate procedure. We have applied
LSPR to unevenly sampled synthetic data and two Arabidopsis
diurnal expression datasets, and compared its performance with
the existing well-established algorithms. Results show that LSPR
is capable of identifying periodic transcripts more accurately than
existing algorithms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most algorithms for analyzing cell cycle or circadian rhythm
temporal expression data require that the input signals are equally
sampled. For irregularly sampled time-series, the Lomb—Scargle
periodogram has been proposed to analyze time-course gene
expression data (Glynn et al., 2006). A comparison study
of periodicity detection methods for irregularly sampled data
concluded that the Lomb—Scargle method performed better than
most existing methods (Zhao et al., 2008). However, this method
is subject to noise and is not powerful for short time-series.

In this study, we propose a new periodicity identiﬁcation
algorithm based on the Lomb—Scargle periodogram and harmonic
regression method for unevenly sampled time-series. Our algorithm,
named LSPR, has a similar procedure to that of the ARSER
algorithm, which was proposed to analyze evenly sampled temporal
expression proﬁles (Yang and Su, 2010). The main difference is that
LSPR uses spectrum analysis for unevenly sampled data introduced
by Lomb and additionally elaborated by Scargle, while ARSER

employs autoregressive spectral estimation, which can only analyze
evenly sampled data.

For a given irregularly sampled time-series, LSPR ﬁrst estimates
the period by the Lomb—Scargle periodogram in the frequency
domain, and then models the periodic signals by the harmonic
regression method in the time domain. Such a joint strategy
overcomes the limitations of the Lomb—Scargle periodogram and
gives better descriptions of periodic patterns. By applying LSPR to
the analysis of synthetic data and Arabidopsis diurnal expression
data, we found our method was more powerful in detecting periodic
transcripts compared with two well-established periodicity detection
algorithms.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

Broadly. LSPR is a three-step integrated algorithm. including data
preprocessing. spectral analysis and harmonic regression. Data preprocessing
entails detrending and smoothing procedures. Detrending removes the linear
trend in the raw time-series using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
This process can remove the effects of accumulating data from a trend. to
show only the absolute changes in values and to allow potential cyclical
patterns to be identiﬁed. The detrended time-series are input into a spectral
analysis and harmonic regression procedure. Including noise may inﬂuence
the ability of the spectral analysis to predict the exact periods. so a fourth
degree Savitzkyilolay ﬁlter (Savitzky and Golay. 1964) is used to smooth
the detrended time-series. before the spectral analysis is used as another input
to evaluate periods. In the spectral analysis step. LSPR estimates the spectrum
by the Lombiscargle periodogram (Lomb. 1976; Scargle, 1982). which
enables the extraction of periodic components from unevenly sampled time-
series. Finally. to validate the statistical signiﬁcance of identiﬁed periodicity
from the spectral analysis. LSPR employs harmonic regression to model the
cyclical components. The harmonic regression model ﬁts the detrended time-
series with sinusoids and gives predictions for amplitude. phase. mean value
and P-Value. The P-Values calculated for each time-series are adjusted for
multiple testing corrections under two alternative false discovery rate (FDR)
procedures (Benjarnini and Hochberg. 1995; Storey and Tibshirani. 2003)
(see Supplementary Material for details).

2.2 Procedure of the LSPR algorithm

LSPR identiﬁes periodicity using the following step-by-step procedures for
an input time-series {xi}:

(1) Remove the linear trend in the time-series {xi}. denoting the detrended
time-series as {in}.

(2) Smooth {in} by a fourth-order Savitzkinolay algorithm. The
smoothed time-series is denoted as {56,}.

(3) Calculate the LomtkScargle periodogram of {56,} (Supplementary
Equation 1). Then select all periods {Ti} 6 [Tslam Tend] that show peaks
in the spectrum. Tum and Tend are the start and end of the selected
period range.

(4) Calculate the LombiScargle periodogram of detrended time-series
{in} (Supplementary Equation 1), and select all periods {7}} e
[Tslm, Tend] that show peaks in the spectrum.

(5) The periods {Ti} and {T}} are chosen as input for the harmonic
regression for {in} (Supplementary Equation 3).

(6) Use Akaike’s information criterion (Akaike, 1974) to determine the
best harmonic regression model among the models generated in Step
(5) and give outputs of period, amplitude, phase and P-Value for {xi}.
Users can use P-Values to identify periodic patterns.

(7) For large-scale time-course data, FDR values are used to determine
periodicity. In this study, genes with FDR values <0.05 are considered
as periodic genes.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Detecting periodicity in synthetic data

To test the LSPR algorithm and compare its performance with
prior methods, we prepared comprehensive datasets containing
periodic and non-periodic samples (see Supplementary Material).
The periodic samples were generated by two models. One is the
stationary periodic model deﬁned by a cosine curve with constant
amplitude and mean value. The stationary model was widely used to
generate synthetic data in previous studies (Liew et (11., 2007; Ptitsyn
et al., 2006; Wichert et al., 2004). Considering the dampening effect
of the circadian rhythm (Westermark et (11., 2009), the periodic data
were also generated by another non-stationary model deﬁned by a
cosine curve with exponentially damped amplitude and mean value.
Compared with the stationary model, the non-stationary model is
more likely to approximate the natural biological rhythm (Reﬁnetti,
2004).

The non-periodic data in the synthetic datasets were generated by
two random processes. One was white noise following a standard
normal distribution. Another widely accepted stochastic process
in time-series is the autoregressive model considering the general
correlation between successive measurements. Here, we used an
autoregressive process of order one (AR(1)) to generate the random
time-series.

In our synthetic datasets, the periodic signals include 10000
stationary and 10000 non-stationary samples with varied period,
phase and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The non-periodic signals
include 10000 white noise signals and 10000 AR(1) signals. Each
time-series possessed 20 unevenly sampled time-points over the
course of 2 days. This sampling design is consistent with the method
adopted by Smith et al. (2004).

Four datasets were constructed by combining the periodic
and non-periodic signals. We applied LSPR, the Lomb—Scargle
periodogram and COSOPT to analyze these four datasets. Since
the task is to separate periodic signals from non-periodic signals,
we can treat it as a binary classiﬁcation problem. This allows
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to be conducted.
Figure 1 shows the ROC analysis for the three algorithms according
to their determination thresholds (FDR q-value for LSPR and

the best of the three algorithms in all the cases.

3.2 Application of LSPR in Arabidopsis diurnal
expression data

Here, we applied LSPR to analyze two independent datasets from the
studies of the diurnal gene expression of a model plant, Arabidopsis.
These datasets were named after their respective ﬁrst author:
Smith data (Smith et al., 2004) and Blasing data (Blasing et al.,
2005). Smith data were unevenly sampled at 11 time-points with 2
biological replicates for each. Blasing data were evenly sampled at
six time-points with 4 h intervals and three biological replicates.
We also applied the Lomb—Scargle periodogram and COSOPT, a
widely used algorithm for analyzing circadian or diurnal expression
data (Straume, 2004) to analyze the same datasets as those processed
with LSPR. We found the Lomb—Scargle method identiﬁed zero
transcripts as rhythmic in both Smith and Blasing data at an FDR
cutoff of 0.05. Thus, we studied the results given by COSOPT
and LSPR. Of all the 22810 Arabidopsis genes, we found LSPR
identiﬁed 7851 transcripts (35% of the complete Arabidopsis
genome) as rhythmic genes in the Blasing data and 6709 transcripts
(30% of the complete Arabidopsis genome) in the Smith data with
an FDR cutoff of 0.05 (Fig. 2A). These fractions of clock-regulated
genes were consistent with an estimate of between 31% and 41% of
expressed genes being circadian regulated reported by a recent study
(Covington et al., 2008). The overlap of identiﬁed rhythmically
expressed genes between the Smith and Blasing data is 19% of all
expressed genes, which is larger than the 13% obtained by COSOPT
(Fig. 2A). Moreover, we found the set of 3602 genes present in
Blasing but absent in Smith, according to LSPR, has signiﬁcant
overlap with the set of 2832 genes present in Blasing but absent in

Similarly, the set of identiﬁed genes present in Smith but absent in
Blasing as found by LSPR also has signiﬁcant overlap with the set
of identiﬁed genes present in Smith but absent in Blasing as found
by COSOPT (54% overlap, 1676 genes in common).

Figure 2B shows LSPR identiﬁed 99% and 97% of the rhythmic
genes identiﬁed by COSOPT in the Blasing and Smith data,
respectively. In addition, LSPR newly identiﬁed 9% and 7% of
the complete genome transcripts as rhythmic genes in the Blasing
and Smith data, respectively. Also, results can be compared with
a benchmark set of 28 known clock-regulated genes reported in
previous studies (Dodd et (11., 2007; Pruneda-Paz, 2009). Two of
these genes were found among the newly identiﬁed genes found
by LSPR in the Blasing data. One is ZEITLUPE (ZTL), which
encodes clock-associated PAS protein (Somers et (11., 2000). The
other is PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB), an element in the input
of the cytokinin signal to the circadian phase (Hanano et (11.,
2006).

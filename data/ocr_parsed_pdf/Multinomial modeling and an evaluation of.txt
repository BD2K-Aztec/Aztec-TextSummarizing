ABSTRACT

Motivation: A principal objective of pharmacovigilance is to detect
adverse drug reactions that are unknown or novel in terms of their
clinical severity or frequency. One method is through inspection of
spontaneous reporting system databases, which consist of millions
of reports of patients experiencing adverse effects while taking one
or more drugs. For such large databases, there is an increasing need
for quantitative and automated screening tools to assist drug safety
professionals in identifying drug—event combinations (DECS) worthy of
further investigation. Existing algorithms can effectively identify prob-
lematic DECs when the frequencies are high. However these algo-
rithms perform differently for low-frequency DECs.

Results: In this work, we provide a method based on the multinomial
distribution that identiﬁes signals of disproportionate reporting, espe-
cially for low-frequency combinations. In addition, we comprehen-
sively compare the performance of commonly used algorithms with
the new approach. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of
the proposed method, and analysis of the Adverse Event Reporting
System data shows that the proposed method can help detect inter-
esting signals. Furthermore, we suggest that these methods be used
to identify DECs that occur significantly less frequently than expected,
thus identifying potential alternative indications for these drugs. We
provide an empirical example that demonstrates the importance of
exploring underexpected DECs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past 50 years, pharmacovigilance has evolved from a
small limited—scale data collection and evaluation process invol—
ving scientiﬁc rationale and debate (Finney, 2003) to a large
world—wide systematic data collection process, which now add—
itionally includes extensive statistical analysis (Bate and Evans,
2009). As data collection and statistical evaluation of adverse

events have become more systematic, the ultimate goal has
remained the same: to identify, as soon as possible, drugiadverse
event combinations (DECs) that pose a signiﬁcant risk to the
population (Hauben et al., 2005; Hauben and Reich, 2005).

Although there has been a manyfold improvement in collect—
ing spontaneous reports, the penultimate goal is extremely difﬁ—
cult to achieve. For one, spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs)
are far from perfect and contain both error and bias. Known
sources of error include incorrect association between drugs and
events, over—reporting (multiple reports for the same incident)
and under—reporting (events that are never reported)
(DuMouchel, 1999; Hauben et al., 2007). In addition, SRS data—
bases are subject to reporting bias [over—reporting of DECs on
publicity of a suspected association (Hauben et al., 2005)].
Furthermore, SRS databases lack exposure information, thus
implying that the event reporting rates derived from databases
can only be considered as relative.

Yet, despite the noise and bias present in SRS databases, it is
still possible to use this data to identify many unusually large
reporting frequencies, which are also known as signals of dispro—
portionate reporting (SDRs) (Hauben et al., 2004). However, it is
extremely important to realize that these SDRs, at best, indicate
associations that are potentially causal and that should be scien—
tiﬁcally evaluated. Moreover, an SDR represents a numerical
output devoid of clinical context and is not equivalent to a
signal of suspected causality (Hauben and Aronson, 2009). In
addition, SRS data are more akin to a census, rather than an
unbiased sample from an underlying true population of adverse
event reports. Therefore ‘estimates’ and corresponding ‘confi—
dence intervals’ of SDRs stemming from any data—mining algo—
rithm (DMA) should really be viewed as ‘pseudo—estimates’ and
‘pseudo—intervals’.

Many statistical approaches, also known as DMAs, have been
applied and developed to find SDRs, especially in the less—than—
desirable conditions that SRS databases present. DMAs fall into
two categories: traditional (or frequentist) methods and Bayesian
methods (Hauben and Zhou, 2003). Each of these approaches
provides distinct advantages and inherent disadvantages
(Hauben and Reich, 2005). The primary advantages of frequen—
tist approaches are that they are simple to compute, are easy to
interpret and have higher sensitivity than current Bayesian meth—
ods when comparing common implementations. However, the
underlying model assumptions fail for low—count drugiadverse

event combinations, which represent a majority of DECs in SRS
databases. Under these conditions, frequentist signal detection
methods can become unstable (i.e. the increased detection of
signals is accompanied by an increased detection of noise) and
unreliable. Bayesian methods, in contrast, attempt to stabilize the
resulting ratio metrics for low—count DECs via shrinkage.
However, these approaches have been shown to be less sensitive
for detecting SDRs for low—count combinations, thus implying
that they can overshrink (Hauben and Reich, 2005). Bayesian
approaches are also less intuitive and more computationally
intensive than frequentist approaches.

Regardless of approach, no one method has been shown to be
superior to others at identifying unusual DECs (Bate and Evans,
2009; Hauben et al., 2005), and the lack of both uniformly
accepted gold standards of causality and a calculus of costs
and utilities associated with correct and incorrect classiﬁcations
in pharmacovigilance complicates head—to—head comparisons.
This should not be surprising, given the inherent messiness of
the data. Furthermore, it has been shown that frequentist and
Bayesian approaches produce similar results for higher—count
DECs (Bate and Evans, 2009). Finally, neither frequentist nor
Bayesian approaches optimally handle low—count DECs, which is
where pharmacovigilance desires to first identify signal.

In this work, we introduce a method based on a multinomial
model for estimating the degree of interaction between a drug
and an adverse event. The resulting score is standardized using a
nonparametric approach, which avoids the asymptotic pitfalls
that frequentist parametric methods must assume in low—count
cases. Furthermore, we compare the multinomial approach and
common DMAs on the metrics of shrinkage and scoring of
DECs. These comprehensive results can enable the practitioner
to better assess the relevance of DECs. Last, we show that these
methods can be used to identify DECs that occur signiﬁcantly
less frequently than expected. Although traditional pharmacov—
igilance ignores this direction of the test, we advocate that this
direction should not be ignored because these results may suggest
potential alternative indications of medicines. Speciﬁcally, large
negative scores could imply that a drug may be beneﬁcial for a
speciﬁc event. This possibility is accommodated by a recently
proposed definition of signal (Hauben and Aronson, 2009).

Our work is organized as follows: in Section 2, we review
several DMAs and explain the caveats of each. In addition, we
propose an empirical approach based on a multinomial model
and illustrate how this approach avoids the pitfalls of frequentist
approaches. In Section 3, we compare each method with the
proposed method on a subset of the Adverse Event Reporting
System (AERS) data. Then in Section 3.2, we show how these
signal detection methods can be used to identify potential alter—
native indications for individual drugs or classes of drugs.
Finally, we summarize and discuss these results in Section 4.

2 METHODS

Many authors have used one or more DMAs to identify signal in SRS
databases (Evans et al., 2001; Hauben, 2004; Hochberg et al., 2007),
whereas others have contrasted performance of DMAs at identifying
known signal (Bate and Evans, 2009; Hauben and Reich, 2005;
Hauben et al., 2007; Hochberg et al., 2009). van Puijenbroek et a].
(2002) provided an extensive comparison of the performance of several

DMAs on identifying signal and concluded that common DMAs perform
similarly at identifying DEC signal when there are at least four reports for
the combination. In this section, we will further explore why common
DMAs perform similarly when there are sufﬁcient numbers of reports.
However, this analysis did not include one of the commonly used algo-
rithms, the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS). In a later sec-
tion, we will extend on the results presented by van Puijenbroek et a].
(2002), including the results from our proposed approach.

2.1 Existing signal detection methods

To begin, we will outline the general problem and corresponding nota-
tion, and we will deﬁne common DMAs and provide references for more
in-depth information. First, given a speciﬁc drug and adverse effect com-
bination, let a represent the number of reports for the drug and adverse
event combination, let I; be the number of reports for individuals taking
the drug but having other adverse events, let 6 be the number of reports
for individuals with the adverse event but not taking the drug and let d be
the number of reports excluding the drug and adverse event. Then the
particular drugiadverse event combination can be represented by the
following 2 X 2 table:

 

Adverse event

 

Yes No
Drug Yes a b
No c d

 

Existing algorithms for detecting signal are based on the association
between drugs and events of the above 2 X 2 table. Common frequentist
methods include the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the proportional
reporting ratio (PRR) (Evans et al., 2001), and are often viewed on the
log scale

d
log(ROR) = logi
bc

a(6+4)

log(PRR) = log C(a + b)

 

Although these two methods are easy to use and interpret, there are
some practical constraints that occur for many DECs. Speciﬁcally, for
ROR to be deﬁned, b and 6 must be greater than zero; similarly, for PRR
to be deﬁned, a+b and 6 must be greater than zero. To determine the
signiﬁcance of the magnitude of any of the above measures of association,
each signal should be evaluated relative to its standard error. The corres-
ponding asymptotic estimates of variability for these methods are

1 1 1 1
SE(log(ROR))% Z+E+E+Zl

1 1 1 1
SE(log(PRR)) ~ 5 — m + E — m
and depend on sufﬁcient cell counts to be reliable (Stokes et al., 2000).
It is easy to see that a, b, c and d must be greater than zero for
SE(log(ROR)) to be deﬁned; a and 6 must be greater than zero for
SE(log(PRR)) to be deﬁned.

Bayesian methods do not suffer from these kinds of constraints and
include the GPS and Bayesian Conﬁdence Propagation Neural Network
(BCPNN) (Bate et al., 1998), and are based on estimating the information
criterion

SE(IC) cx

One can see from the above formulas that E(IC) and SE(IC) are deﬁned
when a, b, c or d are zero, which is a distinct advantage of this method,
especially when trying to detect signal in sparse combinations.

When log(ROR) and log(PRR) are deﬁned, we can use the above
formulas to compare the estimates of variability and their corresponding
estimates of variability under common scenarios. For a majority of DECs
in SRS databases, a << I), 6 << d a n. Under this scenario, a + b a b,
a + c a c and n + X a n, where X is a small integer. Applying these ap-
proximations, one can show the following:

a a
log(ROR) % log(PRR) % logm = logm (1)

n

(a+1)(n+2)2

T + 1

E(IC) = log
a 1

a+1

= “gm

Although (1) and (2) appear to be similar in value, they are not when
a << I), 6 << d. In fact, as E (a) decreases, E(IC) decreases more rapidly
than log(ROR) or log(PRR) owing to the additional 1 in the denomin-
ator of (2). When a is small, E(a) is usually much smaller than 1, which
produces large values of log(ROR) and log(PRR) and a much smaller
value of E(IC). Therefore, the BCPNN method is less sensitive to phar-
macovigilance signal for low-count DECs, which often occurs for more
recently approved drugs or for drugs that have low exposure to the popu-
lationitwo key scenarios where pharmacovigilance desires to identify
signal.

When a << I), 6 << d a n and using the above approximations, one can
show that the estimates of variability are

SE(log(ROR)) s SE(log(PRR)) s SE(IC) s E:

where e is on the order of max(b’1, 6’1). Hence, the estimates of vari-
ability are similar under this common DEC scenario and depend on the
magnitude of a. In a small number of cases, a> b, and b is small (possibly
close to 0). Under this condition,

SE(log(ROR)) s SE(IC) s g

where n is on the order of 6’]. In the small number of cases when a>b,
the standard errors depend more strongly on the magnitude of b.
Alternatively, when a > b,

1
SE(log(PRR)) s ,— + n
‘17 + a

The error for PRR thus depends on the magnitude of a2. Because a is
greater than I), SE(log(PRR)) will be smaller than SE(log(ROR))

and SE(IC). This implies that the standardized PRR will be large when
a>b and b approaches zero.

The mathematical setup of ROR, PRR and BCPNN make it easy to
identify scenarios that cause these methods to yield different signal and
noise values. GPS, in contrast, does not nicely ﬁt into a form that allows
for the same kind of succinct mathematical comparison. Below, we pro-
vide the forms of the signal and error for GPS, which we will then use to
make an empirical comparison across these methods in Section 3.

The GPS method assumes a Poisson distribution for the
observed counts for the i-th drug and the j—th adverse event,
ay- ~ Poisson(A,j >1< [E,»J-), where [E,»j =  is the expected counts for drug
1' and event j if there is no association. The parameter Ay- characterizes the
association between drug 1' and adverse event j. Ay- larger than 1 means
there is positive association, and Ag- smaller than 1 means there is negative
association. The GPS method takes a Bayesian framework, which models
the parameter AU- as a random variable, with prior distribution 710%!) as a
mixed gamma distribution

Ppn'orO‘ij) = ”(}~ij|€¥1 , 131,012, 132, Q)
= Q * Gaﬂglanﬁl) + (1 — Q)Ga(}~ij|€¥2,ﬁz)

for i: 1, ...,Iandj: 1, ...,J, where Ga(A|oz,/3) = %is the gamma
distribution with parameter at and )3. Given the distribution of the
observed counts and the prior distribution of the parameter, we can com-

pute the posterior distribution for the parameter Ay-
PpostcriorO‘z’j)
= ”(}~ij|€¥1 + aye/31+ El], 012 + 01,-, 132 + [E], Q)
= Q >l< Ga(A,»,-|oz1 + a,,, )3, + [E,»,-)
+ (1 — Q)Ga(A,j|a2 + a,,-, 13213,)

where Q is the posterior probability that the parameter Ay- follows the ﬁrst
gamma distribution. We have

Q: Q*NB(ag-|€¥1,1/(1 +ﬁ1/[Eg-D
Q * NB(arj|€¥1,1/(l+ 131/”?sz + (1 - Q)NB(azjlotz,1/(1 + 132/”?sz

where NB(a|oz,p) is the
NBMIOAP) = C$+"’1P"(1 —17)‘H

Then the GPS score is the mean value of Ag- divided by the standard
error of Ag:

 

negative binomial distribution

E(Mj) = EPW-m-(Azj)
SE(MJ') = SEPpmm-(Mj)

To summarize, although ROR and PRR are easy to compute and
interpret, their usefulness is somewhat limited. Speciﬁcally, cell counts
must be sufficiently large for these estimates of independence and corres-
ponding variability to be stable for rare DECs. BCPNN does not suffer
from these constraints, but shrinks the expected IC more harshly as the
expected value of a decreases. This means that BCPNN will not be able to
detect signal for drugs that have low exposure to the population. In the
following section, we propose an empirical nonparametric method for
estimating variability that can yield more stable results than the above
historical methods. Furthermore, it retains the advantages of each of the
above methods while avoiding the disadvantages.

that occur much less frequently than expected). This information
can be used to hypothesize about possible alternative indications
for existing single medicines or to identify classes of drugs that
have potentially beneﬁcial effects.

To evaluate drugs for potential alternative indications, the
above SG scores were used; in addition, Z—scores were generated
for all drugs in a given event. Z—scores were then converted to
cumulative probability P—values. An examination of the resulting
SG scores revealed that two non—steroidal anti—inﬂammatory
drugs have very low scores for mood—related events. For
example, aspirin has an SG score of —14.48 for ‘Anxiety symp—
toms’ (Table 1). SG scores for aspirin were also very low for a
number of other mood—related events. Another Cox—2 inhibitor,
diclofenac, had similarly low SGs for these events.

The potential value of Cox—2 inhibitors in the treatment of
mood disorders has been evaluated by a number of groups
(Ketterer et al., 1996; Lieberman et al., 1987; Mller, 2010).
Aspirin inhibits Cox—2, which in turn participates in the metab—
olism of prostaglandins and arachidonic acids (Santovito et al.,
2009). Arachidonic acid is known to play an important part in
nerve signal transmission, and alterations in this pathway are
thought to be involved in bipolar disorder (Duncan and
Bazinet, 2010; Kim et al., 2009). Individuals suffering from bi—
polar disorder have severe mood swings and often need to take
lithium to stabilize their mood (Machado—Vieira et al., 2009).
Stolk et a]. (2010) have reported that aspirin coadministered
with lithium can result in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in
frequency of emotional incidents. Other workers have found that
aspirin can shorten the time to onset of effectiveness of antide—
pressant compounds (Brunello et al., 2006; Mendlewicz et al.,
2006). Together, these results demonstrate that aspirin can
have dramatic mood effects in some situations.

Recently, dopaminergic compounds have resurfaced as poten—
tial therapeutics in the treatment of leukemia (Sachlos et al.,
2012; Wick, 1981). Although the mechanism behind this effect
has not been worked out, it may be related to dopamine’s known
modifying effects on prolactin production, which, in turn, has
been shown to be linked to leukemia (Braesch—Andersen et al.,
1992). To determine whether negative gamma scores could also
be used to identify drug—class alternative indications, a set of
dopaminergic agents was identified from MESH using the
query ‘Dopamine Agents [Pharmacological Action]’, and drug

names with exact matches to the identified compounds were
flagged. Of 3056 compounds, 55 were classiﬁed as dopaminergic
by this method. The average SD scores for the leukemia—related
events were calculated and compared for all dopaminergic com—
pounds versus all remaining compounds. For every leukemia
event at the HLT level, the average SD score for the dopamin—
ergic agents was statistically lower than that for the remaining
compounds. Statistical signiﬁcance was measured by the
Student’s t—test (Table 2). The results of this analysis demonstrate
that negative gammas can be used to identify potential new
drug—class indications. We have also used this approach to recon—
firm the widely reported melanoma—protective effects of some
non—steroidal anti—inﬂammatory drugs (data not shown).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The use of the SG score based on a multinomial model and the
empirical non—parametric calculation of variance produced re—
sults that were similar to those of well—accepted Bayesian
shrinkage—based methods, with some potentially important dif—
ferences. Namely, the magnitude of the shrinkage was less than
GPS for cardiovascular DECs with one to four reports in an
authentic dataset. As the goal of pharmacovigilance is the detec—
tion of novel adverse events in the most expeditious manner, with
minimal patient exposure, the observed differences at low report—
ing frequencies could be significant, especially as some shrinkage—
based methods such as GPS may miss signals absolutely or
relatively in terms of timingiin other words, some credible sig—
nals may be shrunk along with noise. SG scores may therefore
provide an option for pharmacovigilance organizations to obtain
similar results with a methodology that is arguably more trans—
parent and easily understood by the broader range of drug safety
specialists.

Although the historical pharmacovigilance use of SRS data—
bases has focused on ﬁnding DECs that occur unusually fre—
quently, this work showcases an alternative non—traditional use
of these kinds of databases. As illustrated with the HLT subset of
events, the SG approach can identify signals that occur much less
frequently than expected. Although this kind of information does
not replace results that could be obtained from a controlled clin—
ical study, it does provide a rich source of hypotheses for organ—
izations seeking to explore alternative treatments via currently
approved medicines.

Multinomial modeling

 

Although the mathematical comparisons and contrasts
presented in Section 2 are true regardless of application, the re—
search presented in this work does have a few limitations from
the pharmacovigilance perspective, and opportunities for future
research exist. First, we did not use a gold standard database
containing accepted drug4event signal and adverse event termin—
ology. Therefore, we cannot use the results above to make a
declarative statement about the superiority of any method at
ﬁnding this kind of signal. Second, the ability to stratify the
analysis by age, gender and year of report is common for stand—
ard real—world pharmacovigilance work. The SG approach as
presented above could be used in this context by applying the
method to stratiﬁed versions of the data. Alternatively, a more
complex model could be derived accounting for these factors. A
third limitation is that our method comparison analysis was lim—
ited to the subset of cardiovascular events. In real—world phar—
macovigilance, global database screening is performed on the
entire database, possibly minus certain sources of reports that
are considered not truly spontaneous (e. g. study report). In add—
ition, we used an early implementation of the BCPNN, and the
results we obtained may therefore not apply to current imple—
mentations that have, in effect, been better calibrated for low—
frequency DECs (Hauben and Bate, 2009; Noren et ul., 2006).
Furthermore, we did not take into account the impact of the
adverse event terminology structure used to memorialize adverse
events in spontaneous reporting databases (Hauben et ul., 2006).
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA),
which is used to code the adverse event data, is a hypergranular
hierarchical thesaurus in which a medical concept may be
fragmented in the database across multiple conceptually similar
but literally distinct preferred terms. We did not know the extent
to which this neutralizes some or all of the performance differ—
entials observed. For example, if one method highlighted an as—
sociation between a drug and the cardiac preferred term
cardiomyopathy and another did not, or one highlighted it ear—
lier than another, the clinical signiﬁcance of this difference would
depend on the simultaneous results of both methods with related
terms such as myocarditis. If the method that failed to highlight
cardiomyopathy did highlight myocarditis, and this represents
variability in coding a single concept, then the differences from
a practical perspective are not significant. Ultimately, semantic
search approaches may lessen these biases by allowing many
related event terms to be coalesced into a single event category.
Several groups have begun using methods to explore ontology
models, and more recently to analyze the MedDRA ontology
(Bisgin et ul., 2011; Dupuch et ul., 2012; Reich et ul., 2012).
However, a full exploration of this methodology is beyond the
scope of this article.

Regardless of these caveats, we believe that the SG approach
represents a new and freely accessible methodology for the phar—
macovigilance and research communities. The open nature of the
SG method offers substantial opportunities for further explor—
ation. We present one such opportunity in the potential utility of
using negative SG scores to identify alternative indications for
existing drugs and drug classes.

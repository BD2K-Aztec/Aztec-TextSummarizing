ABSTRACT

Summary: JCVI Metagenomics Reports (METAREP) is a Web
2.0 application designed to help scientists analyze and compare
annotated metagenomics datasets. It utilizes Solr/Lucene, a high-
performance scalable search engine, to quickly query large data
collections. Furthermore, users can use its SQL-like query syntax to
filter and refine datasets. METAREP provides graphical summaries
for top taxonomic and functional classifications as well as a G0,
NCBI Taxonomy and KEGG Pathway Browser. Users can compare
absolute and relative counts of multiple datasets at various functional
and taxonomic levels. Advanced comparative features comprise
statistical tests as well as multidimensional scaling, heatmap and
hierarchical clustering plots. Summaries can be exported as tab-
delimited files, publication quality plots in PDF format. A data
management layer allows collaborative data analysis and result
sharing.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in sequencing technologies have boosted microbial
ecology research by allowing cost-effective sequencing of microbial
communities directly from their natural environment. As of today,
210 microbial metagenomes sampled from diverse environments
such as the ocean, acid mine drainage, soil, bovine rumen and the
human body have been reported (http://www.genomesonline.org/).
Such studies promise to reveal new insights into how microbes
adapt to their abiotic and biotic environment. To distill such
information from metagenomic sequences, computational methods
are being used to identify and analyze their functional and taxonomic
signatures.

Metagenomic annotation pipelines have been developed that help
researchers to identify such information (Markowitz et (11., 2008;
Meyer et (11., 2008; Tanenbaum et (11., 2010). To make higher level
inferences from such annotated data, computational biologists have
developed various analysis tools. MEGAN, for example, allows
users to import BLAST outputs to generate taxonomic and functional

summaries (Huson et (11., 2007). Others allow statistical analysis,
such as MetaStats and ShotgunFunctionalizeR (Kristiansson et (11.,
2009; White et (11., 2009). While most of these tools provide generic
interfaces that are independent of the annotation pipeline used, they
do not allow to analyze function in the context of phylogeny and
vice versa. For example, MG-RAST facilitates the analysis of either
phylogenetic or metabolic content, but they cannot be related to
one another. The same is true for MEGAN that provides individual
taxonomic and functional summaries. Most importantly, with the
ever increasing size of metagenomics datasets, performance and
scalability of such tools becomes essential.

We describe JCVI Metagenomics Reports (METAREP), a new
open source tool that addresses such shortcomings by providing a
scalable yet ﬂexible comparative metagenomics framework.

2 DATA IMPORT

Users can install METAREP and import annotation data obtained
from reads or assemblies using METAREP’s index generation
scripts. The METAREP data format supports the most common
metagenomics annotation data types including a free-text functional
description, best BLAST hit information such as NCBI taxon,
E -value, percent identity, percent sequence coverage, as well as GO
ID, EC ID and protein domain ID (Supplementary Table S1). During
the import process, auxiliary ﬁelds are populated using the NCBI
Taxonomy and Gene Ontology (GO) to store all ancestors of a taxon
or GO ID, respectively.

3 WEB ANALYSIS FEATURES

The METAREP View pages provide high-level summaries for
a dataset (Fig. 1A). Each tab provides a ranked list and bar
chart for the respective data type. The Species Tab, for example,
summarizes top ranks for identiﬁed species. The Search pages let
users specify ﬁelds, or logical combinations of ﬁelds (14 ﬁelds
are supported) to ﬁlter datasets. The auxiliary ﬁelds b1(1st_tree
and g0_tree may be used to select or exclude certain subsets
of the NCBI Taxonomy or the GO tree. For example, one can
search for all bacteria or exclude eukaryotes or search for a certain
GO/taxonomic combination. The search returns lists and pie charts
that summarize the top ﬁinctional and taxonomic categories of the
found subset. Similar summaries can be studied by using the Browse
pages that are available for taxonomic, pathway, enzyme and GO
classiﬁcations (Fig. 1B). The goal of the Compare pages is to help
the user quickly ﬁnd the interesting differences between datasets
(Fig. lC—E). Individual datasets can be grouped together to provide
greater statistical resolving power. After selecting datasets using

the searchable dataset-select box, users can specify a ﬁlter query
that is applied to all datasets before the comparison. In addition, a
minimum absolute count can be speciﬁed to ﬁlter out categories that
are spurious. Various comparative options can be selected ranging
from absolute and relative counts, to chi-square and non-parametric
t-tests (MetaStats; White et (11., 2009) to multidimensional scaling,
heatmap (Fig. 1D) and hierarchical cluster plots (Fig. 1E). Users can
choose the annotation data type they wish to compare by choosing
from several tabs (Taxonomy, GO, pathway, HMM, enzyme and
common name are supported). The level of the comparison can be
speciﬁed in each tab (for taxonomy the rank can be adjusted, for
G0 the distance from the root, etc.). Counts and statistics can be
exported in tab-delimited, plots in PDF format.

4 IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE

METAREP uses the enterprise search platform Lucene/Solr served
by a JETTY web server that runs on a Java HotSpot 64-Bit Server
VM. Currently, we have indexed 68 million documents (46 GB)
distributed over 330 index ﬁles. Much larger index volumes can
be handled as shown by HAthi Trust, a digital library, which
currently indexes 227 Tbytes of data (http://www.hathitrust.org/).
User account information and dataset meta-information is stored in
a MySQL database. The web logic is implemented in PHP using the
CAKEPHP framework. Index ﬁles are served by two load balanced
Dell Power Edge R710 servers each having eight cores (2.66 GHz),
72G RAM and 2x 600 GB HD. Query performance increases linearly
with increasing workload until it peaks at 3100 search requests per
second (Supplementary Fig. l).

5 DISCUSSION

A variety of metagenomics analysis tools are provided either as
standalone or via the web. The strength of our web-based approach

is a generic data model indexed by a high-performance search
engine in combination with a user-friendly Web 2.0 interface.
JCVI’s annotated metagenomes as well as other selected public
datasets can be accessed at www.jcvi.org/metarep. Users that wish
to analyze their own metagenomics data must install the software
and import their own annotations. We invite interested programmers
to contribute to the METAREP open-source project hosted at
http://github.com/jcvi/METAREP. Finally, users are encouraged to
suggest additional features of interest.

The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) recog—
nizes an established scientist each year with the Accomplishment by
a Senior Scientist Award for the significant contributions he or she
has made to the field. This award is bestowed to scientists who have
contributed to the advancement of computational biology and bio—
informatics through their research, service and education work.
Professor Soren Brunak of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for
Protein Research in Copenhagen, Denmark has been selected as the
winner of the 2016 Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award.

The ISCB awards committee, chaired by Dr Bonnie Berger of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA, selected Brunak
as the 2016 winner. Brunak will receive this award and deliver a
keynote address at the 2016 Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology meeting (ISMB 2016) being held in Orlando, Florida on
July 8—12, 2016. ISMB is ISCB’s world class annual meeting that
brings together computational biologists and interdisciplinary scien—
tists from around the globe.

Brunak’s early interest in physics began with a childhood friend—
ship with Jakob Bohr, grandson of Nobel Laureate physicist Niels
Bohr. He considers this early informal exposure to physics instru—
mental in developing his interest in the field but acknowledges that
his physics teacher in primary school also nurtured his interest.
Brunak said, ‘I was primed by the fact that one of my childhood
friends was Jakob Bohr. I grew up close to this family. Maybe I was
therefore listening a little more to what the physics teacher would
come up with. He was good at turning deep questions into some—
thing that could be understood by kids our age’.

Brunak went on to study physics formally as a graduate student
but first took a detour in astronomy. He recalled, ‘First I went into
astronomy, but I found it increasingly difficult to explain at dinner
parties the importance of astronomy’. He then completed his Master
of Science in physics in 1987 at the Niels Bohr Institute, University
of Copenhagen. ‘1 had been fascinated by computers. My masters
thesis was titled The Physics of Computation (in Danish
‘Computerens Fysik’), and I studied what happens in the computer
when it computes. I was inspired by the work of Rolf Landauer and
Charles Bennett at IBM. They worked on determining if you could
compute without dissipating heat in reversible physical processes
where no information would be discarded’. It was Brunak’s interest

 

in the work of Bennett that stimulated his interest in biology.
‘Bennett used DNA transcription as an example of how a computa—
tion (a copy operation) can be done without dissipating a lot of en—
ergy. My thesis was also about computation processes in the brain,
which are related to machine learning. It’s also about throwing in—
formation away so what you are after is distilled out of the data. In
the big data context, there is a huge information reduction need so
my experience with the physics of computation has inspired me
when designing machine learning algorithms that use a lot of infor—
mation and end up with a yes or no, for example answering the
question of whether a protein structure is helical or not at a given
position in the amino acid sequence. A lot of bioinformatics is about
throwing information away in a smart way so what you are really
after is retained’.

Brunak completed his Ph.D. in computational biology in 1991 in
the Department of Structural Properties of Materials at the Technical
University of Denmark. He then went on in 1993 to become founder
and director of the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis at the
Technical University of Denmark, a large center that still exists. His
early work in bioinformatics focused on protein structure. He re—
called, ‘I worked with protein structure with machine learning
approaches. Meetings were small, data sets were small. We tried to
get a lot out of little. We were raised in the data—poor era. The ma—
chine learning approach is not only good for boiling down but also
for extracting’. Even during this era of limited data, Brunak

considered computer power an important priority. ‘During my early
studies in the late 1970s I started with punch cards and huge magnetic
tapes. During my PhD I obtained a grant for a fast four processor
Apollo 10000 machine, and I later always spent a lot of money on
supercomputers so computer speed was not a problem. Now it is
a real problem because we have millions of instances of a genome.
We are in a situation where computer science matters in a new way.
I have been around computers so long so I’ve seen a lot of special pur—
pose hardware developed. But people always go back again and again
to the general purpose computer that can take any algorithm, or do
things like align sequences with any setting’.

Brunak’s early bioinformatics studies looked at both structure and
function and were not limited to sequence properties. Machine learning
was integral to these studies, and he went on to write an authoritative
text on the subject with Pierre Baldi in 1998, titled Bioinformatics:
A Machine Learning Approach. Brunak developed several widely used
algorithms rooted in machine learning including NetGene, which pre—
dicted introns and exons and splice sites, and SignalP, a signal peptide
predictor. He recounted, ‘This was the time of the genome project, so
we started doing exon and intron and splice site prediction using this
method called NetGene. Both SignalP and NetGene were interesting in
that they integrated several different predictors and exploited the same
data from different angles. With NetGene, we had a splice site pre—
dictor and an exon predictor and we put them together and we got a
much better algorithm out of it than staying just in just the splice site
or coding/non—coding domain. In SignalP we also used the same data in
two different ways’.

Brunak recalls some of the surprises of his early research. ‘My
first Nature paper was a small paper in 1990. It was a paper where
we predicted splice sites using machine learning with neural net—
works. We noticed a group of splice sites that the network really did
not want to learn. We just kept training it and it still would not learn
them. We started looking at them and it turned out that half of them
were database errors, and the other half were more interesting, they
were errors made by experimentalists when they interpreted their
[sequence] gels. They had put the splice site in the wrong place. The
would learn the rare, but true GC donor sites very late, but still learn
them. It was an interesting paper that showed the power of machine
learning—that it could be a little more clever than the quality of the
data. Nature was getting tough on GenBank for removing errors,
and here was a computational approach for cleaning up data sets.
We used the same technique with SignalP to identify likely errors.
[We thought] either it’s an error or super unusual and therefore
interesting. We could see in some databases, with signal peptides,
that 10—15% of the data was wrong’. Brunak saw this tedious work
as an important contribution to cleaning up data sets and spent sev—
eral years on this effort.

During the Human Genome Project era, Brunak recognized with
many others in the field the limits of gene prediction from sequence
information alone. But his research using neural networks alluded to
some of our present day understanding of the complexities of gen—
omes. Brunak said, ‘It’s not surprising now that gene prediction was
not 100% successful. Now we know that there’s transcription every—
where and that what constitutes a gene is highly complex. In 1992,
we had a paper in The journal of Molecular Biology UMB) examin—
ing the ways how a neural network looks for gene features in order
to produce a prediction. It turned out when we predicted introns
and exons, it looked for a specific GC—rich signal. It was not easy to
get a paper accepted into IMB, especially when you were trying to
deconvolute theoretically neural network parameters into some bio—
logical signal. The pattern it looked for was perhaps known to a ref—
eree as an early example of an enhancer. Part of the reason of the
success of the machine learning approach is that we didn’t need to
know upfront the features that were behind biological mechanisms’.

Brunak’s research focus has shifted direction in recent years dur—
ing this era of large scale genome projects. In 2007, he was a co—
founder of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein
Research at the University of Copenhagen. The Center’s main goal
is to look for proteins of therapeutic value, and they are developing
approaches that fit into a healthcare context. Brunak leads the trans—
lational disease systems biology group, which looks at genome,
proteome and health data, where some cover the entire Danish
population. Brunak explained, ‘I am interested in disease trajecto—
ries, the order in which you get diseases, comorbidities and follow—
on diseases. If you get type 2 diabetes, you won’t get the same
complications as your neighbor. There are certain trajectories that
are more probable than others’. For the entire Danish population,
almost all personal information, including education, job status and
health records, are tied to a Dane’s personal identification number.
As such, researchers including Brunak have an abundance of unique
data to work with, and much of his work has focused on boiling
down this data into meaningful observations. ‘My contribution is to
put patients into progression groups and interpret proteomics data.
We for example group diabetics and will see how their trajectories
differ. Having the ability to work from the molecular side and hav—
ing health data is presumably going to be powerful. We have data
from 11 million people living and dead. We also essentially have the
family tree from the entire country because it’s encoded in the per—
sonal identification number’.

Brunak’s enduring contributions to computational biology and
bioinformatics have spanned his career, and given the scope of his
recent work, he is certain to make a lasting and valuable contribu—
tion to the field.

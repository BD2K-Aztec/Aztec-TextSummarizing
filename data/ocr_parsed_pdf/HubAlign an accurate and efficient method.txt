ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput experimental techniques have produced
a large amount of protein—protein interaction (PPI) data. The study of
PPI networks, such as comparative analysis, shall benefit the under-
standing of life process and diseases at the molecular level. One way
of comparative analysis is to align PPI networks to identify conserved
or species-specific subnetwork motifs. A few methods have been
developed for global PPI network alignment, but it still remains chal-
lenging in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Results: This paper presents a novel global network alignment algo-
rithm, denoted as HubAlign, that makes use of both network topology
and sequence homology information, based upon the observation that
topologically important proteins in a PPI network usually are much
more conserved and thus, more likely to be aligned. HubAlign uses
a minimum-degree heuristic algorithm to estimate the topological and
functional importance of a protein from the global network topology
information. Then HubAlign aligns topologically important proteins first
and gradually extends the alignment to the whole network. Extensive
tests indicate that HubAlign greatly outperforms several popular meth-
ods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, especially in detecting
functionally similar proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput experimental techniques such as yeast-two-
hybrid (Kayarkar, 2009) and protein co-immunoprecipitation
(Aebersold and Mann, 2003) have produced a large amount of
proteiniprotein interaction (PPI) data for several organisms such
as Homo sapiens (Radivojac et al., 2008) and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Collins et al., 2007). PPI networks contain a signiﬁ-
cant amount of information about modular organization of cells
and protein functions. Comparative analysis such as alignment
of PPI networks can help identify evolutionarily conserved path-
ways/complexes that may be structurally or functionally import-
ant and species-specific pathways/complexes, and infer protein
functions.

Similar to sequence alignment, we can also align PPI networks
either locally or globally. Local network alignment (LNA)
such as NetworkBlast (Sharan et al., 2005), Mawish (Koyuturk
et al., 2006) and AlignNemo (Ciriello et al., 2012) aims to ﬁnd
small isomorphic subnetworks corresponding to pathways and
protein complexes (Wang and Gao, 2012) and thus may yield a

many-to-many mapping between the proteins. These methods
search for conserved subnetworks using an alignment graph, in
which nodes correspond to groups of orthologous proteins and
edges to conserved interactions. These methods mainly differ in
building alignment graphs, the deﬁnition of dense clusters and
search algorithms.

Different from LNA, global network alignment (GNA) aims
to maximize the overall match between the input networks. Such
methods such as IsoRank (Singh et al., 2008a,b), Mawish,
MI-GRAAL (Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011), GHOST (Patro and
Kingsford, 2012), PISwap (Chindelevitch et al., 2013) and
NETAL (Neyshabur et al., 2013) are designed for pairwise align-
ment while others such as NetworkBlast, Graemlin 2.0 and
IsoRankN for multiple alignment. In addition to network top-
ology information, all network alignment algorithms excluding
NETAL and MAGNA (Saraph and Milenkovic, 2013) make use
of sequence similarity to help improve alignment accuracy.
IsoRank aligns two PPI networks by exploiting the observation
that two proteins are good match if their interacting partners can
match well. IsoRankN is an extension of IsoRank and mainly
for multiple network alignment. It applies IsoRank to compute
the alignment score between each pair of networks, and then
employs a PageRank—Nibble algorithm to cluster all the proteins
by their alignment score (Liao et al., 2009). Graemlin2.0 inte-
grates network topology and phylogeny information and uses a
hill-climbing algorithm to generate alignments (Flannick et al.,
2008; Kuchaiev et al., 2010). MI-GRAAL, an improved version
of GRAAL, integrates network topology information such as
graphlet signature and sequence similarity to align two nodes
(Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011). GHOST uses graph spectrum to
measure the topological similarity of proteins (Patro and
Kingsford, 2012). Both MI—GRAAL and GHOST use a seed-
and-extend strategy to build an alignment. MI-GRAAL fulﬁlls
this by solving a weighted bipartite matching, while GHOST by
solving a quadratic problem. PISwap reﬁnes an alignment gen-
erated by other tools such as IsoRank. It iteratively swaps the
edges in an alignment until reaching an optimum (Chindelevitch
et al., 2013). MAGNA uses a genetic algorithm to search for the
best alignment (Saraph and Milenkovic, 2013). NETAL aligns
two proteins based upon their interacting partners.

Current global network alignment methods have two major
issues. One is that existing algorithms run slowly, especially in
aligning very large PPI networks. The other is that the alignment
accuracy is still low. This motivates us to develop a new method
for global network alignment to signiﬁcantly improve both align-
ment accuracy and computational efficiency.

This paper presents a novel global network alignment algo-
rithm, denoted as HubAlign, to align two PPI networks using
both network topology and sequence homology information,
based upon the observation that topologically and functionally

important proteins (such as hubs and bottlenecks) in a PPI net-
work are more conserved and thus, shall be aligned. We use a
minimum-degree heuristic method to estimate the relative im-
portance of one protein from the global network topology infor-
mation. Such a score reflects the topological and functional
importance of one protein in a PPI network. Then, we use a
greedy algorithm to align two proteins based upon the combin-
ation of their importance scores and sequence similarity. That is,
we align more important proteins ﬁrst and then gradually less
important. Such a procedure is more biologically meaningful and
leads to a much faster and more accurate alignment algorithm.
We have tested HubAlign on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
PPI networks, showing that HubAlign greatly outperforms sev-
eral popular methods such as IsoRank, MI-GRAAL, GHOST
and PISwap in terms of both alignment accuracy and running
time.

2 METHODS

Main idea. A biological network usually contains some topo-
logically and functionally important proteins such as hubs and
bottlenecks. Hub proteins have many connections, may be
involved in various biological modules and play a central role
in all biological processes. In Han’s work (Han et al., 2004),
proteins with more than ﬁve interactions are deﬁned as hubs,
while those with fewer interactions are peripheral nodes.
Bottlenecks refer to those proteins with a high betweenness cen-
trality (i.e., the number of shortest paths passing through a node)
N u et al., 2007). These proteins usually connect functional clus-
ters, so removing them can divide a PPI network into several
subnetworks and disrupt the cooperation between functional
modules (Dunn et al., 2005). Because hubs and bottlenecks are
topologically and functionally important, they tend to mutate
more slowly and thus, are more conserved. That is, they are
more likely to be aligned. To make use of this observation, we
assign a score or weight to each node and edge of a PPI network
using an iterative minimum-degree heuristics algorithm, measur-
ing the topological and functional importance of a node (i.e., the
likelihood of being a hub or bottleneck) and an edge in the PPI
network with respect to the global network topology. Such an
importance score reflects the global topological property of a
protein. Then we calculate an alignment score for a pair of pro-
teins using two properties: their relative importance scores (i.e.,
global topological property) and sequence information.
Meanwhile, the global topological property is the most import-
ant and informative. Finally, we construct a global network
alignment by picking those protein pairs with high alignment
scores using a greedy method.

Deﬁnition. We represent a proteiniprotein interaction (PPI)
network by an undirected graph G=(V, E) where V is the set
of vertices (proteins) and E the set of edges (interactions). Let N
(u) denote the neighbors of a node u e V and |N(u)| is the size of
N(u). Let deg(u) denote the degree of vertex u, i.e.
deg (u) =N(u). Each edge e = (u, v) e E may be associated with
a score indicating the interaction strength. A global alignment of
two networks G1 =(V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) is a function g=
V1 —> V2 that maps node set V1 to V2. Without loss of general-
ity, we assume |V1| 5 |V2| where |V| is the number of vertices in
set V.

Computing the topological and functional importance of
proteins. We calculate the relative importance of a node or
edge based upon only the network topology information of a
PPI network. Such a relative importance shows the role of a
node or edge in maintaining network structure or function
(Zhao et al., 2006). Although high-degree nodes play an import-
ant role in maintaining the structure and function of a network
(Zotenko et al., 2008), we do not simply use the degree of one
node to calculate its relative importance, as the degree is only a
local property. We want a global topological property reflecting
the structure of the entire network.

We do not use existing measures such as edge-betweenness
(Ellens, 2011) either, which deﬁnes the number of the shortest
paths going through an edge in a network. That is, edge-
betweenness takes into consideration only the shortest paths in
a graph. Nevertheless, for the robustness of a network the longer
alternative paths are also important (Ellens, 2011). In addition, it
is also observed that (i) edges connecting high-degree nodes are
more important, as they connect many nodes and may be rele-
vant to the global structure property of the network (H., 2006);
and (ii) a pair of two nodes with a large number of common
neighbors are more likely to be related (Liu, 2009).

Here we use a minimum-degree heuristics algorithm to calcu-
late the topological importance of nodes and edges, starting from
the nodes with degree one and stopping at those with degree d.
The value of (1 cannot be very large, as the deletion of very high-
degree nodes (e.g. hubs) may destroy the whole network func-
tionally or structurally while random deletion of a fraction of
peripheral nodes may cause only a small damage to the network
(Wang, 2007; Zhao et al., 2006). Empirically d = 10 yields a good
result. To calculate the relative importance of nodes, we assign
an initial weight to nodes and edges as follows.

1 e e E
W(e)= . ,w(u)=0 VueV
0 0therw1se

Where w(e) and w(u) represent the weight of edge e and node u,
respectively. We may initialize the edge weight by the PPI con-
ﬁdence score if it is available in the PPI data.

We update the weight by always removing one of the nodes
with minimum degree. When one node is removed, its adjacent
edges are also removed and the weight of the removed node and
edges are allocated to their neighboring nodes and edges. In this
way, the topological information is propagated from a node to
its neighbors. In particular, when removing node u e V, we
update the weights as follows.

(1) If deg (u) = 1, VV 6 N(u), set w(v)=w(v)+w(u)+w(u, v).
(2) If deg (u)> 1, Vv1,vz e N(u), set

w(u) + ZveN(u)W(ur V)
|N(u)| |N(u) — 1|
2

Figure 1 shows for a small example PPI network how an edge
gains more weight after the removal of some peripheral nodes.
For example, when nodes d, c, e and f are removed, their own
weight and those of their adjacent edges are transferred to the
edge (a, b), which indicates that this edge is important in main-
taining the network connectivity. After calculating the weights,

w(V1, V2) =W(V1, V2)+

importance score. (1) the original graph; and (2) the graph resulting
from removing nodes (1, c, e and f. The thickness of an edge shows its
weight

we assign an importance score as follows to each node by com-
bining both node and edge weight to indicate its topological
importance in the network.

S(v) = w(v) + A Z w(u, v)

ueV

Where S(v) is the score of node v, A controls the importance of
the edge weight relative to the node weight. Empirically A =0.2
yields a biologically more meaningful alignment. Finally, we
normalize S(v) as follows to reduce the impact of network size.

S(v) = S(v)/maxVev{S(V)}

The way we calculate the relative importance of nodes and edges
is inspired by graph tree-decomposition, which is used to simplify
a graph as a tree in which each vertex represents a highly
connected subgraph component and each edge represents the
intersection between two adjacent components. The size of the
highly connected components reﬂects the topological complexity
of a graph and also importance of nodes. Several simple heuris-
tics methods such as the minimum-degree heuristic method
(Bodlaender and Koster, 2010; Robertson and Seymour, 1984)
are developed to tree-decompose a general graph.

Remark. To validate that the resultant importance score (i.e., S)
makes biological sense, we examine the top 50 proteins with the
highest S scores in the human PPI network. Meanwhile, all the top
10 proteins have a very high degree, which indicates they are vital
hubs of the network. The two example proteins are P62993 with
degree 663 and Q9HOR8 with degree 491. See Figure 2a for the
subnetwork containing P62993. On the other hand, among the top
50 proteins there are also some low-degree proteins, such as
Q9UPN3 with degree 7. As shown in Figure 20, although
Q9UPN3 is not a hub, it is a bottleneck connecting several func-
tional modules. This protein is also related to breast cancer disease
(Rohan, 2009). Another interesting example is P04156 with degree
52 and betweenness 0.005. As shown in Figure 2b, this protein is a
hub connecting several other hubs. Removal of this protein can
disrupt the cooperation of the hubs connecting to it.

Building alignment. The normalized S score measures the
relative importance of one protein with respect to the whole
PPI network. It reﬂects the global topological properties of
one protein in a network. If two nodes have similar S scores,
they may be similarly important in their respective networks.
Thus, they are more likely to be aligned. We calculate the
topological similarity between two nodes u 6 V1 and v 6 V2 as
follows:

A(u, v) = min(S(u), S(v))

 

Fig. 2. Three example proteins (in yellow) with high importance scores in
the human PPI network. (21) Protein P62993, which has the largest degree;
(b) Protein P04156, which connects to some hubs (in red); (c) Protein
Q9UPN3 with low degree that performs as a bottleneck

We also incorporate sequence homology information (i.e.,
sequence similarity) into our alignment score. Let B(u, v) denote
the normalized BLAST bitscore for two proteins u and v. The
final alignment score is defined as follows.

A*(u, v)= a x A(u,v)+(1— a) x B(u, V)

Where 0 5 a 5 1 is a parameter that controls the contribution
of sequence similarity relative to topological similarity.
Meanwhile, a=1 implies that only topological information is
used, while a = 0 implies that only sequence information is
used. Tuning 0: allows us to ﬁnd the relative importance of se-
quence information in aligning the networks. In our implementa-
tion, we set a to 0.7 by default. That is, our method uses much
more network topology information than sequence information.

Our algorithm identiﬁes the pair of nodes with the highest
alignment score as a seed alignment and gradually extends it
using a greedy algorithm. After aligning a pair of nodes u and
v, we then consider aligning their neighbors, which is reasonable
because functional modules and protein complexes are densely
connected and tend to be separated from other subnetwork mod-
ules. Algorithm continues to align neighboring nodes until their
alignment score is relatively high (more than the average of the
alignment scores). When the subnetwork alignment resulting
from the initial seed is terminated, the next best unaligned pair
is chosen as a new seed. This procedure is repeated until all
proteins of the smaller network are aligned with the proteins of
the larger network.

Time complexity. Let n=max{|V1|, |V2|}. At the ﬁrst step, it
takes O(n) to ﬁnd the node with minimum degree. As we men-
tioned before, we only remove the nodes with degree less than 10.
Thus, updating the weight of the neighbors can be done in O(l).
Further, as we can remove up to n nodes from a network, the
total time complexity for the ﬁrst step is O(n2). At the second
step, we calculate the alignment score for each pair of nodes of
the input networks. Because there are at most n2 pair nodes, this
step takes O(n2). At the ﬁnal step, a seed can be selected in
O(n2). Then for extension, we use a priority queue to save the

neighbors of each pair of aligned nodes. Because each node of
the graph has at most 71 neighbors, updating the priority queue
takes O(nlog(n)). Extracting the pair with highest score from this
queue can be done in constant time. That is, the final step for
aligning n nodes takes O(n210g(n)). As such, the total time com-
plexity is O(n210g(n)).

3 RESULTS

We compare our algorithm HubAlign with several popular
and publicly available global network alignment methods
IsoRank (Singh et al., 2008a,b), MI-GRAAL (Kuchaiev and
Przulj, 2011), GHOST (Patro and Kingsford, 2012) and
PISwap (Chindelevitch et al., 2013). Following Chindelevitch
et a]. (2013), we use the alignment produced by GRAAL and
IsoRank as input of PISwap. We do not compare HubAlign
with Graemlin 2.0 (Flannick et al., 2008), because the latter
requires the knowledge of phylogenetic relationship among
species. We do not compare HubAlign with GRAAL because
MI-GRAAL is an improved version of GRAAL. Following
Kuchaiev’s work (Kuchaiev et al., 2010), we evaluate network
alignment quality by five measures including edge correctness
(EC), largest common connected subgraph (LCCS), symmetric
substructure score (S3), functional consistency (FC) and average
of functional similarity (AFS). Meanwhile, EC, LCCS and S3
reﬂect network topological similarity of an alignment, but not
biological signiﬁcance. FC and AFS reﬂect biological signiﬁ-
cance by measuring the consistency of the GO (gene ontology)
terms assigned to the aligned proteins. FC and AFS shall be
more important metrics than EC, LCCS and S3. The alignment
accuracy of two PPI networks depends not only on the evolu-
tionary distance of two respective species, but also on the quality
of the PPI data. That is, the closer the two species are or the
higher quality the PPIs are, the better alignment we may obtain.

Edge correctness (EC). It is calculated as the percentage
of edges in the first network that are aligned to edges in the
second network. Here we assume the ﬁrst network is
smaller than the second one. Let (V1, E1) and (V2, E2) denote two
networks under alignment where V and E denote nodes
and edges, respectively and g : V1 —> V2 be an alignment.
Mathematically, EC is defined as follows.

(117V) 6 E1 2 (g(uA g(v)) 6 E2}|

|{
EC:
lEll

x 100

 

Symmetric substructure score (S3). The intuition underlying S3 is
to penalize the alignments that map sparse regions of the
network to denser ones and vise-versa (Saraph and
Milenkovic, 2013). Let G[V] denote the induced subnetwork
of G with node set V and E(G) denote the edge set of
network G. Let f(E1)= {(g(u), g(v)) e E2 : (u, v) e E1} and
f(V1) = {g(v) 6 V2 : v 6 V1  Mathematically, S3 is deﬁned as
follows.

3 _ |f(El)|

‘ IE1|+IE(G2[f(V1)l)|+|f(E1)| X 100

Largest common connected subgraph (LCCS). It is calculated as
the number of edges in the largest connected subgraph in an

alignment. Larger and denser subgraphs give more insight into
common topology of the network (Kuchaiev and Przulj, 201 1). In
addition, the larger and denser subgraphs may be more biologic-
ally important (Hu et al., 2005), as Bader and Spirin have shown
that a dense PPI subnetwork may correspond to a vital protein
complex (Bader and Hogue, 2003; Spirin and Mirny, 2003).

Functional consistency (FC). We use GO (gene ontology) terms
to measure the functional consistency of two aligned proteins.
GO terms describe some biological properties of a protein such
as Cellular Component (CC), Molecular Function (MF) and
Biological Process (BP). We exclude root GO terms from the
analysis. Proteins with similar GO terms are supposed to be func-
tionally similar. To analyze the biological signiﬁcance of an align-
ment, we calculate the fraction of aligned proteins sharing
common GO terms. The fraction is calculated with respect to
the size of the smaller network because in a global alignment all
nodes of smaller network are aligned to nodes of larger network.
The larger the fraction, the more biologically meaningful the
alignment is.

Average of functional similarity (AF S). It is calculated based on
the semantic similarity of the GO terms, which depends on the
distance between them in the ontology. We can use semantic
similarity measures to calculate the functional similarity in
each category of BP, MF and CC. Schlicker’s similarity,
based on the Resnik ontological similarity, is one of the best
performing methods for computing the functional similarity be-
tween proteins (Pesquita et al., 2009; Schlicker et al., 2006). Let
sC (u, v) denote the GO functional similarity of proteins u and v in
category c (i.e., BP, MF or CC). AFS is deﬁned as follows.

3.1 Alignment of the yeast and human PPI networks

We apply our algorithm HubAlign to align the yeast and human
PPI networks, which are taken from IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012).
The yeast PPI network has 5673 nodes and 49 830 edges and the
human network consists of 9002 nodes and 34 935 edges. We ran
IsoRank and PISwap with the default parameters. MI-GRAAl
was run using the degree, signature similarity and sequence simi-
larity. The parameters for GHOST are automatically determined
or set to default.

As shown in Table 1, our algorithm HubAlign produces an
alignment with much larger EC, LCCS and S3 than the other

methods except NETAL. To measure the FC and AFS of an
alignment, we extract the GO annotations for all the involved
proteins from the Gene Ontology database (Ashburner et al.,
2000). Some proteins may not have any GO annotations, so
we just take into consideration the aligned pairs in which both
proteins have GO annotations. Table 1 show that HubAlign
yields alignments with signiﬁcantly higher AFS than the other
methods, especially when BP and MF are considered. We also
calculate the percentage of aligned pairs in which two proteins
share at least one, two, three, four and ﬁve GO terms, respect-
ively. As shown in Table 2, HubAlign greatly outperforms the

others in terms of FC. The advantage of HubAlign becomes
larger when more shared GO terms are required to determine
FC. NETAL yields more aligned proteins and interactions, but
many aligned proteins are not functionally similar.

3.2 Alignment of PPI networks of human, yeast, ﬂy,
worm and mouse

We also apply HubAlign to align PPI networks of H.sapiens
(human), S.cerevisiae (yeast), Drosophila melanogaster (ﬂy),
Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) and Mus musculus (mouse). All
these networks are obtained from IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012).
Table 3 lists the AFS of all the pairwise alignments generated by
five different methods: HubAlign, IsoRank, PISwap, MI-
GRAAL and GHOST. The humaniyeast alignment is already
analyzed in the preceding section, so it is not included here.
Table 3 shows that the alignments produced by HubAlign
outperform those by the other methods in term of AFS under
all three categories BP, MF and CC. HubAlign also produces
alignments with higher FC than all the other methods (see
Supplementary Table S1). Speciﬁcally, the more common GO
terms required to determine FC, the more advantage
HubAlign has over the other methods. For example, if only
one shared GO term is required, HubAlign greatly outperforms
the second best method GHOST for ﬁve of nine alignments
(i.e., humaniﬂy, ﬂyiyeast, mouseiworm, mouseiﬂy and

ing four alignments. If at least two shared GO terms are used to
determine FC, HubAlign greatly outperforms GHOST for all the
alignments. Moreover, HubAlign produces alignments with
larger EC, LCCS and S3 than the others except NETAL (see
Supplementary Fig. S1). The NETAL alignments again have
very low FC and AFS. These results indicate that HubAlign is
able to align more functionally similar proteins and find larger
complexes that are signiﬁcant either topologically or biologically.

3.3 Alignment of bacterial PPI networks

We also apply HubAlign to align the PPI networks of two bac-
terial species Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli, which
have the most complete PPI networks among all bacteria. The
PPI network for Bacterium Cjejuni has 1111 nodes and 2988
edges (Parrish et al., 2007). Escherichia coli is a model organism
for studying the fundamental cellular processes such as gene ex-
pression and signaling. The E.coli PPI network has 1941 nodes
and 3989 edges (Peregrin—Alvarez et al., 2009). As shown in
Table 4, HubAlign produces an alignment with larger EC,
LCCS and S3 than the other methods except NETAL. In
terms of AFS, HubAlign outperforms the other methods al-
though all the AFS values are pretty small due to insufﬁcient
GO annotations of the bacterial proteins. The average number of
GO terms associated with the proteins of E.coli and Cjejuni is

3.4 Evaluation of parameters A and or

Our algorithm makes use of two parameters A and a. A deter-
mines the relative importance of edge and node weight, while 07
determines the relative importance of sequence and topological
similarity. In this section, we study the relationship between these
two parameters and network alignment quality. We apply
HubAlign to PPI networks of yeast and human and report
EC, LCCS, S3 and AFS of their alignment for different values
of parameter A between 0 and 1. As shown in Figure 3, AFS
increases as A gets close to 1. The underlying reason could be that
the higher values of A give more importance to the edge weights
which in turn, makes the proteins with important interactions
align together. On the other hand, by increasing the value of A,
we put less emphasis on the node weight and therefore, it is less
likely that the hubs be aligned together. As a result, the topo-
logical qualities (i.e. EC, LCCS and S3) decrease. Figure 3 shows
that increasing A from 0 to 0.2 improves the AFS signiﬁcantly
but does not change the EC much. However, as we continue to
increase A further, the EC decreases sharply. We also observe a
slight increase in the biological quality. There are similar plots
for the S3 and the LCCS (see the Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus,
we can achieve a good trade-off between the topological and the
biological quality by setting A in the range (0.1, 0.2).

We also compute the yeastihuman alignment for different
values of a. As shown in Figure 4, increasing a from 0 to 1
decreases AFS. This is because a larger value of 07 reduces the
effect of sequence information. Moreover, in line with our ex-
pectations as or goes up, so does the topological quality of the
alignment. Figure 4 shows that increasing a from 0 to 0.7 does
not change AFS much but improves the EC significantly.
However, as we continue to increase a further, the AFS decreases
sharply. There are similar plots for the S3 and the LCCS (see the
Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, we can achieve a good trade-off
between the topological and the biological quality by setting a in
the range (0.7, 1).

3.5 Running time

Our method HubAlign is much more computationally efﬁcient
than the others. Tested on the yeastihuman alignment on a
1400MHz Linux system with 2GB RAM, it takes NETAL,
HubAlign, IsoRank, MI-GRAAL and GHOST 80, 412, 7610,
78 525 and 3037 s, respectively, to terminate. PISwap has almost
the same running time as IsoRank because the former only
slightly reﬁnes the result generated by the latter.

4 CONCLUSION

This paper has presented a new method HubAlign for global
alignment of two PPI networks by making use of topological
importance of proteins in a PPI network. We have implemented
and tested HubAlign using quite a few PPI networks and eval-
uated the resultant alignments using different performance met-
rics. We have also compared HubAlign with currently popular
global network alignment algorithms such as IsoRank, MI-
GRAAL, NETAAL, GHOST and PISwap. Experimental results
indicate that our algorithm greatly outperforms the others in
terms of both alignment accuracy and running time. In particu-
lar, our algorithm can align many more functionally similar
proteins.

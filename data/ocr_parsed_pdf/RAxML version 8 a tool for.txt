RAxML version 8

 

RobinsoniFoulds distances, as well as extended majority rule,
majority rule and strict consensus trees (Aberer et al., 2010).

Beyond this, it implements a method for identifying the so—
called rogue taxa (Pattengale et al., 2011), and I recently imple—
mented options for calculating the TC (Tree Certainty) and IC
(Internode Certainty) measures as introduced by Salichos and
Rokas (2013).

Finally, there is the new plausibility checker option (Dao et al.,
2013) that allows computing the RF distances between a huge phyl—
ogeny with tens of thousands of taxa and several smaller more
accurate reference phylogenies that contain a strict subset of the
taxa in the huge tree. This option can be used to automatically
assess the quality of huge trees that can not be inspected by eye.

2.5 Analyzing next-generation sequencing data

RAxML offers two algorithms for preparing and analyzing next—
generation sequencing data. A sliding—window approach (unpub—
lished) is available to assess which regions of a gene (e. g. 16S)
exhibit strong and stable phylogenetic signal to support decisions
about which regions to amplify. Apart from that, RAxML also
implements parsimony and maximum likelihood ﬂavors of the
evolutionary placement algorithm [EPA (Berger et al., 2011)]
that places short reads into a given reference phylogeny obtained
from full—length sequences to determine the evolutionary origin
of the reads. It also offers placement support statistics for those
reads by calculating likelihood weights. This option can also be
used to place fossils into a given phylogeny (Berger and
Stamatakis, 2010) or to insert different outgroups into the tree
a posteriori, that is, after the inference of the ingroup phylogeny.

2.6 Vector intrinsics

RAxML uses manually inserted and optimized x86 vector intrin—
sics to accelerate the parsimony and likelihood calculations.
It supports SSE3, AVX and AVX2 (using fused multiply—add
instructions) intrinsics. For a small single—gene DNA alignment
using the 1" model of rate heterogeneity, the unvectorized version
of RAxML requires 111.5s, the SSE3 version 84.4s and the
AVX version 66.22s to complete a simple tree search on an
Intel i7—2620 M core running at 2.70 GHz under Ubuntu Linux.

The differences between AVX and AVX2 are less pronounced
and are typically below 5% run time improvement.

2.7 Saving memory

Because memory shortage is becoming an issue due to the grow—
ing dataset sizes, RAxML implements an option for reducing
memory footprints and potentially run times on large phyloge—
nomic datasets with missing data. The memory savings are pro—
portional to the amount of missing data in the alignment
(Izquierdo—Carrasco et al., 2011)

2.8 Miscellaneous new options

RAxML offers options to conduct fast and more superflcial tree
searches on datasets with tens of thousands of taxa. It can also
compute marginal ancestral states and offers an algorithm for
rooting trees. Furthermore, it implements a sequential,
PThreads—parallelized and MPI—parallelized algorithm for com—
puting all quartets or a subset of quartets for a given alignment.

3 USER SUPPORT AND FUTURE WORK

User support is provided via the RAxML Google group
at: https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#lforum/raxml. The
RAxML source code contains a comprehensive manual and
there is a step—by—step tutorial with some basic commands avail—
able at http://www.exelixis—lab.org/web/software/raxml/hands_
on.html. Further resources are available via the RAxML soft—
ware page at http://www.exelixis—lab.org/web/software/raxml/
Future work includes the continued maintenance of RAxML,
the adaptation to novel computer architectures and the implemen—
tation of novel models and datatypes, in particular codon models.

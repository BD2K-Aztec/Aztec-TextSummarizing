ABSTRACT

Summary: In consanguineous families, as a result of inheriting the
same genomic segments through both parents, the individuals have
stretches of their genomes that are homozygous. This situation leads
to the prevalence of recessive diseases among the members of these
families. Homozygosity mapping is based on this observation, and in
consanguineous families, several recessive disease genes have been
discovered with the help of this technique. The researchers typically
use single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to determine the homozy-
gous regions and then search for the disease gene by sequencing
the genes within this candidate disease loci. Recently, the advent of
next-generation sequencing enables the concurrent identification of
homozygous regions and the detection of mutations relevant for diag-
nosis, using data from a single sequencing experiment. In this respect,
we have developed a novel tool that identifies homozygous regions
using deep sequence data. Using *.vcf (variant call format) files as an
input file, our program identifies the majority of homozygous regions
found by microarray single nucleotide polymorphism genotype data.

1 INTRODUCTION

In communities with a high level of consanguineous marriage,
the diagnosis of a recessive genetic disorder offers a unique
advantage for positional cloning of rare diseases. In such an
isolated inbred human population, several individuals may in-
herit a variation of an ancestor, and the offsprings born of con-
sanguineous union will have a high probability of inheriting two
copies of the mutated chromosomal segment and thus expressing
the disease. In this respect, homozygosity mapping is an effective
approach to identify potential disease loci. Because Lander and
Botstein successfully used this technique in 1987 (Lander and
Botstein, 1987), both the experimental and the computational
methods that are used to generate and analyze relevant datasets
have undergone diversification and refinement. Originally, to

detect homozygous regions, individuals were genotyped with
panels of highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (or microsat—
ellite) markers, typically at genomic intervals of 1(Ll2 cM. With
the availability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) micro-
arrays, short tandem repeat microsatellites were later replaced by
SNP arrays to survey the genome and to identify large stretches
of homozygosity. The overlapping regions among the homozy-
gous stretches of affected individuals are called runs of shared
homozygosity (ROSHs), and these regions are expected to con-
tain the disease gene. For this purpose, several computational
tools have been developed (Amir el et al., 2010; Carr et al.,
2006; Kayserili et al., 2009; Papic et al., 2011; Seelow et al.,
2009; Uz et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011).

Even though the identiﬁcation of recessive disease loci (homo-
zygous regions) is accomplished using the aforementioned SNP
array-based techniques, the next step to detect pathogenic se-
quence variant is sequencing. Until recently, only the candidate
genes in these loci are sequenced. If this disease locus is a large
interval or if it includes several genes, the determination of dis-
ease causing mutations by Sanger sequencing becomes a back-
breaking task. At this point, next-generation sequencing (NGS)
platforms present an alternative solution with their capacity to
sequence the entire genome. Owing to the moderate costs and
tractable data amounts, exome sequencing is a promising ap-
proach to detect novel mutations of human monogenic disorders.
Hence, it is now possible to concurrently identify homozygous
regions and possibly deleterious sequence variants, using data
from a single sequencing experiment. To the best of our know-
ledge, only two programs have been developed to detect homo-
zygous regions from NGS data, i.e. AgileVariantMapper (Carr
et al., 2013) and HomozygosityMapper (Seelow and Schuelke,
2012). But, these programs do not take into account the distri-
bution of the variants within the genomic coordinates. Here, we
developed a novel sliding window-based methodology, which
provides the advantage of scanning the genome in detail, but
at the same time detecting the candidate homozygous regions
easily. This type of analysis gives us the opportunity of convert-
ing the genotype information into a signal, where we can apply
well-known signal processing techniques.

2 DESCRIPTION

HomSI was designed to deﬁne homozygous stretches in consan-
guineous families from NGS data. The overall analysis ﬂow of
HomSI is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 81.

2.1 Processing NGS data

Variant call format (*.ch) ﬁles are standard output ﬁles of vari-
ant identiﬁcation programs that process NGS data. These ﬁles
can be directly used as an input ﬁle to HomSI. Because the
read depths for some regions might be low, we provide users
different ﬁltering options such as quality-based user-deﬁned
region or variant-based ﬁltering. Details are available in the
user manual.

To identify and Visualize the homozygous stretches, HomSI
processes each variant and generates several graphs. Here, we
illustrate HomSI outputs using autosomal recessive Klippel
Feil Syndrome dataset (Bayrakli et £11., 2013). In Figure 1(a—b),
the genotype information is plotted for different individuals,
where the x-axis shows the samples and the y-axis indicates gen-
omic coordinates. The variants of an index case are colored in
blue for homozygous and in yellow for heterozygous cases. For
other individuals, although a homozygous variant is indicated

with blue, the contrasting homozygous is represented with
white and the heterozygous with orange. For all individuals,
gray indicates no call and yellow indicates non-informative
SNPs, which are heterozygous for index case (see
Supplementary Table S1 for details). HomSI starts with an un-
biased approach and generates homozygosity maps for whole
genome (Fig. 1a). Once a continuous blue line, which is shared
among affected individuals, but not in unaffected ones, is recog-
nized as in Figure 1a, the user can zoom in this region on the
chromosome-based representation (Fig. 1b).

To be able to identify the ROSHs, we normalized the number
of homozygous and heterozygous variants within each window
separately (named as Horn and Het signals) and plotted these
signals for each affected (Fig. lo) and unaffected (Fig. 1d) indi-
vidual. Using the differences between the Horn and Het signals,
which were plotted for each individual in Figure 1e, a prediction
signal was generated in Figure If. This ﬁnal signal indicates the

2.2 Comparative evaluation

We evaluated HomSI using both a simulated dataset generated
by (Seelow and Schuelke, 2012) and a real dataset of three
disease genes within the homozygous regions, which have been
previously identiﬁed using a combination of exome and SNP
microarray data (Aldahmesh et at, 2012; Shamseldin et at,
2012). On the simulated dataset, HomSI successfully detected
the homozygous region on chromosome 15, as shown in
Supplementary Figures S8 and S9. On the real dataset, we inves-
tigated whether the exome sequence data could identify a homo-
zygous region, without prior SNP array analysis. For all three
patients, HomSI detects the homozygous regions, as shown in
Supplementary Figures S10 and S12.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a state-of-the-art method to identify homo-
zygous stretches using NGS data and created a user-friendly
tool. Because the usage of HomSI is so simple and intuitive,
the clinicians or researchers can immediately start their data
analysis without consulting to any dedicated information tech-
nology specialist. We provide a step-by-step tutorial and a de-
tailed documentation on our Web site.

Abstract

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in regulating tumor progression and metastasis.
Identifying key miRNAs, defined by their functional activities, can provide a deeper understanding
of biology of miRNAs in cancer. However, miRNA expression level cannot accurately reflect
miRNA activity.

Results: We developed a computational approach, ActMiR, for identifying active miRNAs and
miRNA—mediated regulatory mechanisms. Applying ActMiR to four cancer datasets in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA), we showed that (i) miRNA activity was tumor subtype specific; (ii) genes
correlated with inferred miRNA activities were more likely to enrich for miRNA binding motifs; (iii)
expression levels of these genes and inferred miRNA activities were more likely to be negatively
correlated. For the four cancer types in TCGA we identified 77—229 key miRNAs for each cancer
subtype and annotated their biological functions. The miRNA—target pairs, predicted by our ActMiR
algorithm but not by correlation of miRNA expression levels, were experimentally validated. The
functional activities of key miRNAs were further demonstrated to be associated with clinical out—
comes for other cancer types using independent datasets. For ER’lHERZ’ breast cancers, we iden—
tified activities of key miRNAs let—7d and miR—18a as potential prognostic markers and validated
them in two independent ER’lHERZ’ breast cancer datasets. Our work provides a novel scheme to
facilitate our understanding of miRNA. In summary, inferred activity of key miRNA provided a func—
tional link to its mediated regulatory network, and can be used to robustly predict patient’s
survival.

breast cancers (Calin et (11., 2005; Iorio et (11., 2005). However, these
studies did not provide direct mechanistic links between miRNAs and
their mRNA targets, therefore, whether and how the identified
miRNAs play key regulatory roles in post—transcriptional regulation is
not clear.

A conventional way for identifying key regulatory miRNAs,
which potentially regulate expression levels of a large number of
genes, is to explore miRNA—mRNA relationships based on their ex—
pression levels. By integration of mRNA and miRNA expression lev—
els, key cellular pathways related with miRNA signatures are shown
to associate with cancer progression (Dvinge et (11., 2013). However,
the association between miRNA and mRNAs does not imply that
the miRNA causally regulates these genes. It may be due to pleio—
tropic effect of upstream regulators. Furthermore, miRNA expres—
sion level is not equivalent to its functional activity (Mullokandov
et (11., 2012). There are proteins or RNAs that can mediate the inﬂu—
ence of miRNAs on target genes, such as RISC complex (Krol et (11.,
2010). The relative abundance of miRNAs to its target genes deter—
mines the functional activity levels of miRNAs (Ebert et (11., 2007).
Thus, to infer key miRNAs and understand their gene regulatory
networks, it is critical to accurately quantify the regulatory activity
of miRNAs by considering their effectiveness on target genes.

By applying systematic computational models integrated with
prior information on the regulatory sequence of miRNAs, multiple
miRNA—mediated pathways have been identified. For example, key
miRNAs are shown to affect genes’ expression levels using an inte—
grative model (Setty et (11., 2012). Different approaches for identify—
ing key miRNAs have been proposed such as testing miRNAs
binding sites enrichment among sets of co—expressed genes
(Gennarino et (11., 2012). Some studies infer the miRNA activity
using mRNA expression data of genes enriched for miRNA target
sites (Arora and Simpson, 2008; Madden et (11., 2010) or average
difference in expression levels of miRNA targets versus non—targets
(Cheng et (11., 2009). However, these methods do not explicitly con—
sider the role of miRNAs as a Qost—transcrigtional regulator. The
amount of expression level variation attributed to miRNA regula—
tion corresponds to the changes from the total transcribed mRNA
level (or baseline mRNA expression level). The model to consider
pre—processed mRNA level is essential to accurately infer miRNA
activities.

Here we present a novel computational method ActMiR for ex—
plicitly inferring the a_ctivity of m_iRNAs based on the changes in the
expression levels of target genes due to post—transcriptional regula—
tion. The inferred miRNA activity is further used to identify key
miRNAs that regulate expression levels of a large number of genes
and may drive tumor progression. Key miRNAs identified from its
inferred activity can be used as biomarkers for predicting prognosis
or as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Our ActMiR method
for inferring miRNA activity is based on two assumptions about
miRNA function: (i) the baseline expression levels of target genes
(when a miRNA has no impact) is approximated by their levels in
samples with low expression level of the corresponding miRNA (as
sufficient miRNA concentration is essential for its function); (ii) the
suppression of target genes by a miRNA depends on the expression
levels of the mRNAs (Doench and Sharp, 2004).

We applied ActMiR to four cancer types in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA). ActMiR identified 77—229 key miRNAs that play a
key role in transcriptional regulations for each cancer subtype. We
demonstrated that our inferred miRNA activity could be further
used for identifying functional target genes and as prognostic bio—
markers. Notably, we identified let—7d and let—7g as key tumor sup—
pressors in ER’IHER2’ breast cancers, targeting on the expression

level of collagen and extracellular matrix genes. The predicted puta—
tive causal relationships between let—7d and let—7g and target genes
based on the inferred activity were experimentally validated.
Additionally, the predicted activities of let—7d and let—7g were asso—
ciated with survival. We further demonstrated in two independent
cohorts that predicted activities of two key miRNAs (i.e. let—7d and
miR—18a) in ERT/HERZT breast cancers were consistently associ—
ated with survival, while none of expression levels of these key
miRNAs was significantly associated with survival. The phenom—
enon that only miRNA activity predicted by our ActMiR method
was robustly associated with patient survival was observed in mul—
tiple cancer types. Taken together, our proposed ActMiR method
does not only identify key miRNAs, but also provides direct mech—
anism links between miRNAs and their functional mRNA targets
which in turn act together to affect clinical phenotypes.

2 Methods

2.1 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data

To identify key miRNAs that regulate a large subset of transcrip—
tome and in turn affect tumor progression, we integrated mRNA ex—
pression data with miRNA expression data for four cancer types in
TCGA: Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), Colon adenocarcinoma
(COAD), Glioblastoma (GBM) and Ovarian serous cystadenocarci—
noma (OV). We selected these four cancer types because there were
publically available independent cohort datasets consisting of both
mRNA and miRNA expression profiles as validation sets. We fur—
ther considered subtypes of each cancer that was previously classi—
fied by gene expression levels or clinical features (Brennan et (11.,
2013; Cancer Genome Atlas, 2012; Verhaak et (11., 2010). For
GBM and COAD, we classified tumor samples based on gene ex—
pression levels. For BRCA, the samples were classified into ERJr and
ER’IHER2’ subtypes based on its clinical features (Supplementary
Table 1). See details in the Supplementary Methods section.

2.2 ActMiR for inferring a_ctivity of m_iRNAs from
expression levels of miRNA and its target genes

We developed ActMiR, a method for inferring miRNA activity
based on expression levels of miRNAs and their predicted target
genes. Figure 1 presents an overview of ActMiR for inferring
miRNA activity. Three pieces of information were used: (i) miRNA
expression levels of samples; (ii) mRNA expression levels of sam—
ples; (iii) the predicted target lists of each miRNA. For the predicted
target list of miRNAs, we used a collection of predicted target genes
for 1537 unique mature miRNAs from TargetScan (www.targets—
can.org) that considers all conserved miRNA binding sites inherited
from 23—way alignments of UTR sequences (Grimson et (11., 2007).
We filtered out miRNAs whose number of target genes is smaller
than 10. We further focused on miRNAs whose predicted target
genes’ expression levels and their own expression levels were
available.

The ActMiR method consists of three steps. First, for each
miRNA, we estimated the ‘baseline’ expression levels of miRNA’s
target genes at the state where the miRNA had no impact. As suffi—
cient miRNA concentration is essential for its functional activity, we
defined baseline expression level of the target gene t of miRNA (p as
£2, = Em)
samples with low miRNA expression level (Fig. 1A) (see

 

e((p) —> 0), which is the average expression level of the

Supplementary Methods for estimating the baseline expression
level). Next, we defined the ‘degradation’ levels as the difference be—
tween the observed expression levels of targeted genes for each

Fig. 1. The overview of our ActMiR procedure. (A) The miRNA and mRNA ex-
pression matrix are used to infer the regulatory activity of miRNA for each
sample and for each miRNA. For each miRNA, we estimated the baseline ex-
pression levels of target genes from their expression levels within samples
with the lowest miRNA expression level. For each sample, the degradation
levels of target genes were computed as the difference between expression
levels in the sample and baseline expression levels. (B) For each sample inde-
pendently, genome-wide linear regression of baseline expression levels on
degradation levels was performed. The coefficient from this linear fitting, esti-
mated using an IRLS regression (shown in Supplementary Figure S1), repre-
sents miRNA activity

sample, which is affected by the miRNA, and the baseline expres—
sion level, which is unaffected by the miRNA. For each sample 5,
degradation levels yin of predicted target t of miRNAs (p is deter—
mined as follows: yiﬁtﬁs : yzﬁt — ytﬁs, where ytﬁs is the observed ex—
pression level of the predicted target. The expression degradation
level allows us to measure how much expression level change of the
target gene is potentially affected by each miRNA. Finally, based on
the assumption that the impact of a miRNA on its target genes de—
pends on its expression level (Doench and Sharp, 2004), we used a
linear model representing the relationship between the degradation
levels and baseline expression levels of target genes for each sample,
Yin“ : angﬁtd-ﬁs in which the coefficient aw represents the ac—
tivity of miRNA (p in sample 5, where T is the collective set of all tar—
gets of miRNA (p (Fig. 1B). Not all predicted target genes with seed
sequences are functionally regulated by miRNAs (Wu et al., 2015).
To take account for the probability of a predicted target gene being
a functional target, we used an iteratively reweighted least squares
(IRLS) regression method to estimate aw, assuming that the higher
anti—correlation between miRNA activity and a gene’s expression
level across samples indicates the higher possibility of being a func—
tional target (shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary
Methods).

2.3 Identifying key miRNAs and theirfunctional target
genes

A key miRNA was defined as the miRNAs whose activity is signiﬁ-
cantly associated with a large number of mRNAs’ expression levels.

To determine key miRNAs, we first computed associations between
miRNA activity and mRNAs’ expression levels using the Pearson
correlation. The significance of associations between activity of
miRNA and mRNA’s expression level was assessed by permutation
tests (see Supplementary Methods for details). Second, we counted
the number of genes whose expression levels were significantly cor—
related with each miRNA activity. We determined the threshold of
number of genes correlated to each miRNA that was significantly
larger than numbers from the permuted datasets.

For each key miRNA, we examined the functional target genes,
whose expression levels were correlated with miRNA activity,
among predicted target genes of the miRNA based on TargetScan
(Grimson et al., 2007). We further annotated function of key
miRNAs by comparing their direct target genes with 1320 canonical
pathways from BioCarta, KEGG and Reactome (Subramanian et al.,
2005), identified biological pathways over—represented in the func—
tional target gene set of each miRNA using the Fisher’s exact test.
The FDR was computed based on the 50 randomized datasets, as
the ratio of the average number of pathways with a P—value below
threshold across permuted datasets, and the number of pathway
with P—value below threshold.

2.4 Validating functional target genes of key miRNAs
HCC1187 cells (obtained from ATCC) were cultured in RPMI1640
media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/
streptomycin. Forward transfection of mirVana inhibitors against
miR—1 8a—5 p, let—7d—5 p, or let—7g—5p was performed. After 72 h incu—
bation, total RNA was extracted. For cDNA synthesis reaction, 1 pg
of the total RNA was used with TaqMan Reverse Transcription
Reagents. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed by using Power
SYBR Green Master Mix. Details were shown in Supplementary
Materials and Supplementary Table S2.

2.5 Identifying prognostic key miRNAs based on their
activities

To further explore functional relevance of key miRNAs, we identi—
fied prognostic key miRNAs. We tested whether there was associ—
ation between overall survival time and miRNA activities for each
cancer type in TCGA using a univariate Cox regression model.
Additionally, survival prognosis by individual miRNAs was tested
using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model including cova—
riates such as age at diagnosis, lymph—node status, tumor grade if
available. To determine the statistical significance, we randomly
permutated the activity for each miRNA for 1000 times, then used
the resulting empirical null distribution to compute a FDR. For com—
parison, we applied the same procedure based on the expression of
miRNA instead of the activity of miRNA.

2.6 Validating prognostic key miRNAs in independent
datasets

We further validated our predicted prognostic key miRNAs in five
independent datasets consisting of both miRNA and mRNA expres—
sion profiles, including two datasets for BRCA and one for each re—
maining cancer type. All independent datasets we used were
summarized in Supplementary Table S3. For GBM and COAD, we
clustered samples based on gene expression levels, and for BRCA,
we used clinical information to classify samples (Details are shown
in Supplementary Methods). For each dataset, we inferred miRNA
activity from miRNAs and mRNAs expression levels using the pro—
cedure described above, and then tested association between the
inferred activity of each key miRNA and overall survival to identify

prognostic key miRNAs. For Buffa et al.’s (201 1) breast cancer data—
set, because the overall survival is not available, we used distant re—
lapse free survival time instead.

3 Results

3.1 miRNA—mRNA correlations were cancer subtype
specific

Due to its molecular and therapeutic heterogeneity, each cancer type
is generally categorized into subtypes according to gene expression
patterns or clinical features (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2012; Cancer
Genome Atlas, 2012; Gruvberger et al., 2001; Verhaak et al., 2010),
and each subtype is of significantly distinct molecular portrait, re—
sponse to therapies and survival rate (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2012;
Verhaak et al., 2010). The miRNA—mRNA correlation structure for
each cancer subtype was different (Supplementary Figs S2A, S3A
and S4A). In particular, strong miRNA—mRNA associations based
on all samples might be due to miRNA and mRNA expression level
differences among cancer subtypes instead of true association be—
tween miRNA and mRNA (Supplementary Figs S213, S313 and S413).
Additionally, subtype—specific miRNA—mRNA relationships (see
purple in Supplementary Figs S2A, S3A and S4A) might be missed
when considering all samples as a whole. These results suggested
that miRNA regulatory mechanisms were subtype specific and each
subtype should be studied individually, consistent with recent re—
ports that transcriptional regulations of target genes by miRNAs
were cancer subtype specifics (Farazi et al., 2014; Pecot et al., 2013;
Song et al., 2013).

Therefore, for GBM and COAD, we classified tumor samples
based on previous classification (Brennan et al., 2013; Cancer
Genome Atlas, 2012; Verhaak et al., 2010) (Supplementary Table
S1). For BRCA, expression levels of many miRNAs (i.e. 211 out of
682 miRNAs tested) were strongly associated with ER status
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). Among ER’ tumors, 21 samples were
HER2T, which was another important clinical feature to determine
effective therapies. Expression levels of 18 miRNA were strongly
associated with HER2 status (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Therefore,
we classified samples into ERJr and ER7/HER27 subtypes. We
focused on each subtype in all further analyses. All subtypes used
were listed in Supplementary Table S1.

3.2 Expression level of miRNAs was not sufficient for
identifying causal relationship with target genes

We first evaluated relationships between miRNA and mRNAs ex—
pression levels in individual cancer subtypes using Pearson correl—
ations. For the most subtypes of cancers, the distributions of
interconnectivity between miRNA and mRNA followed a scale—free
distribution (Supplementary Fig. S5), which is the common property
of biological networks (Chen et al., 2008). This observation sug—
gested that there were a small number of miRNAs associating with a
large number of genes’ expression levels, denoted as hub miRNAs.
Hub miRNAs were not equivalent to key miRNA regulators, which
likely functionally regulated a large number of mRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). Indeed, predicted miRNA binding motifs,
based on TargetScan (Grimson et al., 2007) were not enriched
among these correlated genes for most cancer subtypes (x—axis in
Fig. 2A and Supplementary Figs S7A, S8A and S9A). Furthermore,
for OV and BRCA, the mRNA—miRNA correlations were dominated
by positive associations (x—axis in Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig.
S9B), indicating that the correlation between expression levels of
miRNAs and mRNAs was likely due to pleiotropic effect of

motifs among genes whose expression levels were correlated with each

cates the total number of genes whose expression levels are correlated with
each miRNA activity levels. (B) The percentage of positive miRNA-mRNA cor-
relations. The percentage of positively correlated mRNAs for each miRNA
based on miRNA expression levels (x-axis) and that based on miRNA activ-
ities (y-axis) were shown. Each dot in the plots represents one miRNA

upstream regulators. Together, our results suggest that the expres—
sion level of miRNAs was not sufficient to identify functional rela—
tionships between miRNA and mRNA nor key miRNAs for cancers.
This motivates us to infer ‘functional’ activity of a miRNA by inte—
grative analysis of expression levels of miRNA and its target genes.

3.3 Inferred miRNA activities were subtype specific

As the accessibility of essential miRNA machinery or relative abun—
dance of miRNA targets might affect the activity of miRNA (Krol
et al., 2010), the inferred miRNA activities did not always correlate
with miRNA expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S10). In general,
the correlation between activity and expression level of miRNA was
positive corresponding to its role in target degradation, therefore,
the distribution of their correlation coefficients was positively
skewed (Supplementary Fig. S10). It is worth to note that inferred
miRNA activities were not sensitive to platforms used for profiling
miRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. S11). For the TCGA data—
sets, there were more miRNAs with high correlation between its ac—
tivity and expression value for BRCA and 0V. There were also
subtype—common and subtype—specific miRNAs. For example, miR—
18a was one of miRNAs, whose activity was the most significantly
correlated with its expression levels in both BRCA subtypes
(r : 0.62 and 0.54 for ER7/HER27 and ERT, respectively), whereas,
the correlation between miR—200b expression and its activity was
significant only for ERT/HERZT samples (r: 0.42) but not for ERJr
samples (r: —0.004)

To distinguish potential causal relationships from associations
between miRNA activities and their correlated mRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. S6), we investigated the enrichment of pre—
dicted target genes among genes associated with each miRNA

activity. We showed that genes whose expression levels correlated
With miRNA activities were more significantly enriched for miRNA
target genes predicted based on TargetScan (Grimson et al., 2007)
than genes correlated with miRNA expression levels (y—axis in
Fig. 2A and Supplementary Figs S7A, S8A and S9A). Furthermore,
for 0V and BRCA, the dominance of positive correlations between
mRNA and miRNA was not detected when miRNA activities in—
stead of miRNA expression levels were used (y—axis in Fig. 2B
and Supplementary Fig. S9B). For example, the distributions of
the percentage of positive associations based on miRNA
activity and miRNA expression were significantly different for both
ERT/HER2T (the Wilcoxon rank sum test P—value<10715) and
ERJr subtypes (P—value < 10’”). This observation suggested that the
activity of a miRNA implies its potential of functional regulation on
target mRNAs, and the activity of miRNA could be used to infer
key miRNAs, which are defined as miRNAs that might causally
regulate a large number of mRNAs.

3.4 Identifying key miRNAs leads to novel insights into
breast cancer biology

We defined key miRNAs as the miRNAs whose activities associated
with expression levels of a number of genes larger than expected by
chance. For the BRCA dataset, 85 and 96 key miRNAs were identi—
fied for ERT/HER27 and ERJr subtypes, respectively
(Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 for ERJr and ERT/HER27 sub—
types, respectively). Among them, 44% and 39% of key miRNAs
for ERT/HER2T and ERT, respectively, were common. Key
miRNAs included well—known miRNAs whose causal roles in breast
cancers have been previously studied, such as miR—203, miR—495
and miR—125b as ERT specific key miRNAs (Hwang—Verslues et al.,
2011; Scott et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011), miR—9, let—7d, let—7g,
miR—200b and miR—200a as ER7/HER27 specific ones (Gregory
et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2012) and miR—27a, miR—
17 and miR—20a, miR—141, miR—106b, miR—301a, miR—339—5p,
miR—429, miR—200c, miR—222 as common key miRNAs (Hossain
et al., 2006; Mertens—Talcott et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2011; Smith
et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2010; Yu et al. 2008; Zhao et al., 2008).

To understand function of key miRNAs, we compared the func—
tional target genes of each key miRNA with 1320 canonical path—
ways from BioCarta, KEGG and Reactome (Subramanian et al.,
2005 ), identified biological pathways significantly enriched in func—
tional target gene set of each miRNA at FDR < 1% corresponding
to the Fisher’s exact test P—value< 1 X 1074 (Supplementary Figs
S12—15). For the ERT/HER2T BRCA, we found total 23 biological
pathways that were significantly enriched in target sets of at least
one of 85 key miRNAs and the 1 1 key miRNAs with at least one en—
riched pathway were clustered into two groups according to their
inferred function (Fig. 3). The first cluster contained five miRNAs
(miR—20a, miR—17, miR—93, miR—106a and miR—106b), which were
strongly associated with cell cycle related pathways (Fig. 3), consist—
ent with previous findings that miR—17 and miR—20a were regulators
of cell cycle transition in breast cancer and cancer cell proliferation
(Yu et al., 2008). The functional targets of these miRNAs included
known cell cycle regulators such as E2F3 and CDC25A. The second
cluster contained two miRNAs (let—7g and let—7d) that were enriched
for several pathways, such as the ECM receptor interaction and the
collagen formation (Fig. 3). The functional target genes within these
pathways include twelve collagen genes and ten molecules associ—
ated with extracellular matrix receptor (e.g. THBSI, THBSZ, FN1,
ITGAII and ITGB5) (Supplementary Fig. S16). The activities of
these miRNAs were significantly anti—correlated with expression

Fig. 3. Functional annotation of key miRNAs' functional targets. Heatmap of
pathway enrichment of functional target genes of each key miRNA for ER’/
HERZT group of BRCA. The displayed pathways were significantly enriched
for target genes of at least one key miRNA

levels of their target genes, representing degradation of transcripts of
these genes by miRNAs. A recent study showed that high levels of
collagen in breasts were associated with breast cancer metastasis
(Zhang et al., 2013), which is common in triple negative breast can—
cers. In particular, let—7g was shown to promote breast cancer inva—
sion and metastasis (Qian et al., 2011). These together suggested the
importance of these two key miRNAs (let—7d and let—7g) in ERT/
HER2’ breast cancers metastasis.

For ERT BRCA, 27 pathways were significantly enriched
(FDR< 0.01) in target gene sets of at least one key miRNA
(Supplementary Fig. S12A). Among the 27 pathways, 6 pathways
including cell cycle pathway were significantly enriched for both
ERT/HER27 and ERT. In particular, the genes involved in the cell
cycle pathway were regulated by four key miRNAs (miR—106a,
miR—93, miR—17 and miR—20a), consistent in ER7/HER27 subtype.

3.5 Functional activities of key miRNAs were

associated with survival rate

To further explore functional relevance of key miRNAs, we tested
whether there was association between overall survival and
the activities of each miRNA based on TCGA data. We identified
3 and 30 significant prognostic key miRNAs at 5% FDR
(P—value < 1.2 X 1072) for ERT and ERT/HERZT subtype of BRCA,
respectively (Table 1). It is worth to note that miRNA activities
were more significantly associated with clinical outcome than their
corresponding expression levels for most key miRNAs (Fig. 5A).

There were only three prognostic key miRNAs for ERJr breast
cancer. One reason for lack of prognostic key miRNAs might be
that downstream genes modulated by miRNAs were highly over—
lapped (Supplementary Fig. S17A), suggesting that regulatory net—
works of ERJr breast cancer were regulated together by many key
miRNAs. Therefore, perturbing individual miRNAs was unlikely to
have a significant impact on regulatory networks of ERJr breast can—
cer, resulting in less prognostic power of individual miRNA.

In contrast, we identified 30 prognostic key miRNAs for ER’/
HER2T breast cancer, whereas only 11 non—key miRNAs were sig—
nificantly associated with clinical outcomes (P—value< 1.2 X 1072)
(Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S6). The activities of well—known
miRNAs whose causal roles in breast cancers have been studies,
including miR—200c, miR—200b (Gregory et al., 2008) and miR—

106b, miR—17, miR—20a (Hossain et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2012;
Yu et al., 2008), were associated with clinical outcomes.

We found the prognostic miRNAs with particular interests.
First, the functional target genes of three prognostic miRNAs includ—
ing miR—106b, miR—17, miR—20a were highly enriched for mitotic
cell cycle (Fig. 3). Secondly, let—7d and let—7g were detected as a
regulator of metastasis (Fig. 3) as well as the prognostic miRNAs.
Tumors with over—active let—7d and let—7g were associated with bet—
ter overall survival rate in ERT/HER27 breast cancers (P—
value < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. S18BC). These observations
were consistent with the previous study showing association of let—
7g depletion with poor prognosis and its effect on tumor metastasis
(Qian et al., 2011). Furthermore, miR—18a was the key miRNA of
prognostic power in ERT/HER27 breast cancer, corresponding to its
role in induction of malignancy (Mouw et al., 2014). Even though
the activity and the expression level of has—miR—18a were signifi—
cantly correlated (r : 0.62) in ERT/HER27 breast cancer, its activity
was significantly associated with survival (P—value < 0.003) while its
expression level was not (Fig. 5A). This suggests the activity of
miRNA instead of expression level of miRNA was functionally sig—
nificant in breast cancer prognosis.

3.6 Experimental validation of key miRNA—target pairs

in vitro

Inference of miRNA activity using our ActMiR method relies on ex—
pression level changes of miRNA target genes. To validate potential
causal relationships between prognostic miRNAs and their target
genes, which affect biological processes related to patient survivals,
we perturbed prognostic miRNAs let—7g, let—7d and miR—18a in a
triple negative breast cancer cell line and measured responses of
their target genes. For each miRNA, we measured expression
changes of two functional targets among its target genes, whose ex—
pression levels were most correlated with miRNA activity in the
TCGA dataset. Comparison of qPCR results of the control and
siRNA of each miRNA confirmed that each miRNA regulated the
expression of its predicted target genes (Fig. 4A). As expected, HI C1
and FZD4 mRNA expression increased in anti—miRNA treatment. It
is worth to note that HIC1 and FZD4 were predicted as functional
targets of let—7d and let—7g only based on miRNAs’ activities but not
based on miRNAs’ expression levels (Fig. 4B), further validating the
importance of the miRNA activity.

activity (red). The miRNA activities of let-7d and let-7g significantly correlated
with the expression levels of FZD4 and HIC1, whereas the expression of let-7d
and let-7g did not. Knocking down the expression levels of let-7d and let—7g in
a triple negative breast cancer cell line HCC1187 led to up-regulation of FZD4
and HIC1. Similarly, up-regulation of ESR1 and ZBTB4 by knocking down
miR-18a suggested ESR1 and ZBTB4 were functional target genes of miR-18a

3.7 Validating prognostic value of key miRNAs in
independent cohorts

To validate prognostic potential of key miRNAs’ activities, we col—
lected two independent breast cancer cohorts (Buffa et al., 2011;
Dvinge et al., 2013) with miRNA and gene expression profiles
(Supplementary Table S3). For each ERT/HER27 subtype of valid—
ation dataset, we performed the same procedure and identified 53
and 36 key miRNAs for Buffa et al. and Dvinge et al. dataset, re—
spectively. Encouragingly, these key miRNAs significantly over—
lapped with the ones derived from the TCGA BRCA dataset (P—
value < 2 X 1075, and 0.01 for Buffa et al. and Dvinge et al. dataset,
respectively). For the ERT/HER27 breast cancer in Buffa et al. data—
set, the activities of let—7d, miR—18a, hsa—miR—130b and miR—224
were associated with metastatic outcomes (P < 1072) (Fig. 5C). Two
of them (let—7d and miR—18a) were prognostic key miRNAs in
TCGA samples (Fig. 5C; Table 1). Based on Dvinge et al. dataset,
the activity of miR—18a was consistently associated with survival of
patients with the most advanced tumors (Stage III) (Fig. 5C). It is
worth to note that the expression of let—7d, miR—18a were not asso—
ciated with overall survival in any datasets (Fig. 5B and
Supplementary Fig. S18AB). Furthermore, the functional target
genes of let—7d and let—7g from TCGA dataset significantly over—
lapped with the sets from the validation datasets (for let—7d,
P—values < 2 X 10722, and <1 X 10727, and for let—7g,
P—values< 1 X 10736, and <1 X 10760 for Buffa et al. and Dvinge
et al. dataset, respectively). The target genes of miR—18a based on
were TCGA and Buffa et al. samples also significantly overlapped
(P—value < 1 X 10727). Together, our results suggest the miRNA ac—
tivity can robustly predict patient survival in independent validation
sets while miRNA expression levels can’t.

and 0V datasets and identified 77—229 key miRNAs for each caner
subtype (Table 1). For GBM, about 40% of key miRNAs for each
subtype (e.g. 39%, 32%, 38% and 43% for classical, mesenchymal,
neural and proneural subtypes, respectively) were subtype specific
miRNAs, whereas for COAD, 60% of total key miRNAs were com—
mon for at least two subtypes. We also compared the direct func—
tional target genes of each key miRNA with 1320 canonical
pathways from BioCarta, KEGG and Reactome (Subramanian et al.,
2005 ), and biological pathways regulated by each miRNA at
FDR< 1% (Supplementary Figs S13—15). Interestingly, for the
COAD, we detected that most pathway—miRNA pairs were subtype
specific (Supplementary Fig. S13). On the other hand, the neuro—
transmitter related pathways were common among subtypes of
GBM (Supplementary Fig. S14).

We compared miRNA activity and patient survival information,
and identified 16, 32 and 4 significant prognostic key miRNAs at
5% FDR (corresponding to P—value < 1.2 X 1072) for OV, MSI/
CIMP subtype of COAD, and Proneural subtype of GBM, respect—
ively (Supplementary Figs S19A, S20A, S21A; Table 1,
Supplementary Table S6). To test whether these prognostic key
miRNAs’ activities can robust predict patient’s survival, we assessed
their prognostic potentials in independent cohorts with miRNA and
gene expression profiles (Supplementary Table S3). Results were
shown in Supplementary Figures S19B, S20B and S21B.

For OV, the activities of three prognostic key miRNAs (miR—9,
miR—519d and miR—520d"') in TCGA data were also significantly
associated with clinical outcome in the independent cohort dataset
(Bentink et al., 2012) (Fig. 6A). It has been shown that miR—9

regulate a large number of genes and applied it to multiple cancer
types. Our approach explicitly infers miRNA activities instead of
using miRNA expression levels as a surrogate. By applying this
method to mRNA and miRNA expression profiles in four different
cancer types, we identified 77—229 key miRNAs for each tumor sub—
type. In particular, when applied our approach to the TCGA breast
cancer dataset, we identified 85 and 96 key miRNAs for ER’/
HER2’ and ER+ breast cancers, respectively. It is worth to note
that results based on clinical subtyping (ER/HER2/PR status) and
molecular subtyping (PAM50 classification) were similar
(Supplementary Fig. S22A and detailed in Supplementary Results).
Key miRNAs of prognostic potentials were still significantly associ—
ated with survival after adjusting clinical/pathological parameters
(Supplementary Fig. S23). ERT/HER2’ especially triple negative
breast tumors are frequently invasive and metastatic involving biolo—
gical processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling.
Interestingly, we identified two miRNAs (let—7d and let—7g) that
regulated genes involved in extracellular matrix. Furthermore, we
showed that activities of let—7d were consistently associated with
survival in the independent breast cancer studies. Our results not
only support metastasis is associated with survival of triple negative
breast cancers, but also show that let—7d, and let—7g are putative key
regulators of metastasis. Additionally, the activity of miR—18a was
prognostic in all three independent cohorts. In addition to as poten—
tial prognostic biomarkers, the inferred activities of these key
miRNAs in ER7/HER2’ breast cancers can also be valuable thera—
peutics targets as there are very limited therapeutic options for triple
negative breast cancers.

Our findings based on an unbiased systematic approach were
supported by the previous observations based on experimental ap—
proach in great details (Mouw et al., 2014; Qian et al., 2011). Our
analyses suggested the role of let—7g in tumor metastasis (Qian et al.,
2011) and miR—18a as a malignancy promoting factor in breast
tumors (Mouw et al., 2014) by the miRNA activity followed by its
functional annotation and prognosis test. Furthermore, our result
also suggested the novel role of let—7d in metastasis and prognosis,
whereas the previous study failed to identify it because their study
was based on the expression levels of let—7 miRNA family instead of
miRNA activity (Qian et al., 2011). This suggests our approach
based on the inferred miRNA activity will facilitate to find more
tumor—promoting or prognostic miRNAs that may not be identified
based on their expression levels alone.

Different types of survival outcomes were used in the TCGA,
Dvinge et al., and Buffa et al. breast cancer datasets. By overlapping
results based on these datasets, we reduced potential false positives,
but might also miss many true positives. However, survival analyses
based on both miRNA expression level and miRNA activities suf—
fered the same drawback. Our result showed that there was no prog—
nostic miRNA based on expression level consistent in multiple
independent datasets while there were multiple prognostic miRNAs
based on activities consistent in multiple independent datasets, sug—
gesting our approach based on the miRNA activity is robust.

In an effort to uncover prognosis biomarkers of cancers,
miRNAs would be a suitable candidate due to their small size result—
ing in resistant to RNase degradation (Lawrie, 2008). Furthermore,
we showed that the effect of miRNAs for prognosis was robust. We
measured the effectiveness and robustness of miRNAs vs. CNV as
prognostic markers using two independent cohorts of 0V
(Supplementary Fig. S24 and detailed in Supplementary Results).
CNVs are predominant functional genomic alterations in OV
(Ciriello et al., 2013). Interestingly, we found only one consistent
prognostic CNV factor or associated mRNA factor, whereas three

consistent prognostic miRNAs based on activity in OV
(Supplementary Fig. S24), suggesting a potential of miRNA activ—
ities as effective and robust biomarkers.

It is worth to note that our ActMiR approach aims to infer
miRNA activities, not to comprehensively identify miRNA targets.
The ActMiR procedure for inferring miRNA activities is based on
regression models. Too few candidate targets of a miRNA included
in the ActMiR procedure may result in less robustness of miRNA ac—
tivity estimation. On the other hand, too many low confident candi—
date targets included will bias miRNA activity estimation to zero.
There were multiple miRNA target prediction data bases in addition
to TargetScan, such as miRanda (Betel et al. 2010) and PITA
(Kertesz et al., 2007). Compared to other databases, TargetScan
covered more miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S25A). Also, target
genes based on TargetScan were more consistent with experimen—
tally derived targets (such as by CLASH containing both canonical
and non—canonical targets (Helwak et al., 2013), and PAR—CLIP
containing canonical targets (Farazi et al., 2014) methods) than
other database (Supplementary Fig. S25BC).

Unlike TargetScan which predicted canonical miRNA targets,
experimental approaches such as CLASH (Helwak et al., 2013) re—
vealed both canonical and non—canonical miRNA targets. However,
miRNA—target gene interactions are subtype/context—specific. Most
experimental methods covered only limited number of conditions,
resulting large numbers of false positives or false negative, which in
turn affect accuracy of miRNA activity inference based on the re—
gression model. Also, experimentally derived target sets were only
available for a fraction of miRNAs. For example, CLASH dataset
(Helwak et al., 2013) consisted of 399 miRNAs and PAR—CLIP
dataset (Farazi et al., 2014) consisted of only 68 miRNAs. It is hard
to make fair comparison of miRNA activities across all miRNAs if
target genes for some miRNAs contain experimentally derived tar—
gets while others do not. Thus, we used only TargetScan but exclud—
ing other experimentally derived target databases in our current
study.

The target genes from the TargetScan database were mainly pre—
dicted based on seed sequences so that miRNAs in the same miRNA
family share targets. To test whether considering miRNAs in the
same miRNA family together enhance the ability to identify poten—
tial miRNA functional targets, we compared the percentage of nega—
tive correlations between the predicted target genes’ expression
levels with the sum of the expression levels of miRNAs in a family
or the expression levels of individual miRNAs. Our result
(Supplementary Fig. S26) showed that considering all members in a
miRNA family as a whole did not improve regulatory potentials of
miRNAs. On the other hand, many studies (Boyerinas et al., 2010;
Elefant et al., 2011; Helwak et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2015) suggested
that miRNAs in the same miRNA family have different binding pat—
terns to their target genes even though they have the same seed se—
quences. Also, only a fraction of predicted target genes were
regulated by a miRNA, reﬂecting to idiosyncratic patterns of
miRNAs in the miRNA family. We used WLS regression to account
for binding affinity differences to different target genes when infer—
ring a miRNA activity. As a result, different miRNAs in the same
miRNA family, which had the same set of target genes based on
TargetScan, had different sets of functional targets. For example,
activities of let—7a and let—7d correlated with different genes among
the same set of target genes (Supplementary Fig. S27).

A miRNA can post—transcriptionally regulate many target genes.
In our validation experiment, we only tested two targets whose ex—
pression levels most correlated corresponding miRNA activities.
Validation of a few target genes may not guarantee that other target

genes will be regulated by miRNAs nor related pathways regulated
miRNAs. Instead of genome—wide target gene validation and func—
tional validation, which are needed in future studies, we validated
miRNA—target relationships by showing that miRNA functional tar—
get sets based on independent datasets were significantly
overlapped.

Our regression procedure for inferring miRNA activity fully ac—
counts for post—transcriptional regulation by miRNA activity in con—
trast to directly use the expression level of either the miRNA or
targeted genes as a surrogate for miRNA regulatory activity. Indeed,
the target genes of miRNAs that were predicted based on the activity
and were experimentally validated in this study could not be de—
tected as target genes based on corresponding miRNA expression.
There are multiple experimental approaches for estimating miRNA
activities. Mullokandov et al. (2012) proposed to experimentally
measure miRNA activity by quantifying its target genes in high—
throughput manners. They demonstrated that some highly expressed
miRNAs might exhibit relatively weak activity, which in some cases
correlated with a high target—to—miRNA ratio or increased nuclear
localization of the miRNA. Our results were consistent with their re—
sults: only one third of miRNAs analyzed show significant
(FDR< 1%) correlation between their expression levels and activ—
ities. However, our method is different from their method in several
aspects: (i) our inferred activity is cell context specific instead of syn—
thetic environments; (ii) our method is based on degradation levels
of all genes with predicted miRNA binding motifs instead of expres—
sion levels of a few genes with conserved binding motifs.

Similarly, Pecot et al. (2013) and other papers showed that genes
and associated pathways functionally regulated by a miRNA were
cancer subtype specific. Farazi et al. (2014) combined experimen—
tally defined miRNA binding sites and TargetScan predicted
miRNA binding sites to define miRNA target genes and used differ—
ence of median correlations of miRNA target genes or miRNA non
target genes with miRNA expression level to indicate miRNA activ—
ity. Farazi et al. showed that only a fraction of target genes predicted
by TargetScan were repressed by a miRNA and miRNA activity was
cancer subtype specific. Even though some conclusions were similar,
our approach significantly differed from Farazi et al.’s approach in
multiple ways. First, our iterative weighted regression approach for
inferring miRNA activity explicitly identified functional target genes
of miRNAs in each cancer subtype based on in vivo data. In con—
trast, Farazi et al. inferred subtype specific target genes based on
in vitro data of one single cell line of other cancer subtype, which
contradicted with their own assumption that miRNA target genes
were cancer subtype specific. Second, even though the choice of
using correlation between gene expression and miRNA activity and
target gene enrichment test to infer functionally active miRNAs in
our approach or correlation between gene expression and miRNA
expression level to reﬂect miRNA function activity used by Farazi
et al. is subjective, our approach is applied to multiple breast cancer
datasets, indicating that our ActMiR approach for inferring miRNA
activities is robust. More importantly, our approach can be readily
applied to any cancers without the need of experimentally deriving
miRNA targets in the specific cancer type.

Taken together, our results underscore the value of inferring
miRNA activity from a systems biology perspective as a promising
strategy for investigation of its causal effects on target genes, and
furthermore survival outcomes of cancer patients. There are several
directions in which this approach can be extended. First, the integra—
tion of miRNA, mRNA, CNV and other high throughput data into
Bayesian causal models (Zhu et al., 2012) may shed light on how
key miRNAs are regulated and lead to further refine miRNA—

mediated regulatory networks. It will also be interesting to uncover
the mechanisms underlying the miRNA functions by comparison of
regulators between activity and expression of miRNAs using CNV
or mutation data. Furthermore, a model considering several
miRNAs together is needed to investigate the cooperative or syner—
getic effects between miRNAs function. Finally, it is worth to fur—
ther assess potentials of key miRNAs as prognosis biomarkers and

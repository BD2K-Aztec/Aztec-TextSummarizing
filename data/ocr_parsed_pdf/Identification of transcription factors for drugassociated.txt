ABSTRACT

Motivation: One of the major findings in systems biomedicine is that
both pathogenesis of diseases and drug mode of action have a
module basis. However, the transcription factors (T Fs) regulating the
modules remain largely unknown.

Results: In this study, by using biclustering approach FABIA (factor
analysis for bicluster acquisition), we generate 49 modules for gene
expression profiles on 1309 agent treatments. These modules are of
biological relevance in terms of functional enrichment, drug—drug inter-
actions and 3D proximity in chromatins. By using the information of
drug targets (some of which are TFs) and biological regulation, the
links between 28 modules and 12 specific TFs, such as estrogen
receptors (ERs), nuclear factor-like 2 and peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma, can be established. Some of the links
are supported by 3D transcriptional regulation data [derived from
ChlA-PEI' (chromatin interaction analysis using paired-end tags)
experiments] and drug mode of action as well. The relationships be-
tween modules and TFs provide new clues to interpreting biological
regulation mechanisms, in particular, the lipid metabolism regulation
by ERa. In addition, the links between natural products (e.g. polyphe-
nols) and their associated modules and TFs are helpful to elucidate
their polypharmacological effects in terms of activating speciﬁc TFs,
such as ERs, nuclear factor-like 2 and peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma.

1 INTRODUCTION

Roughly speaking, the basis of drug actions is to rectify the gene
expression disorders in diseases through modulating transcrip-
tion factors (TFs). Therefore, the gene expression-based analysis
has played a critical role in drug repurposing, lead discovery and
elucidating drug mode of action (MoA) (Iorio et al., 2010). The
pathogenesis of diseases has been revealed to be tightly con-
nected to gene modules, which are sets of functionally related
genes (Suthram et al., 2010). Intriguingly, by using biclustering
approach iterative signature algorithm, Iskar et a]. revealed
that drug MoA also has a module basis, which provided new

insights into drug actions and perturbed cellular systems as
well (Iskar et al., 2013). However, the TFs regulating the drug-
associated transcriptional modules remain unknown, which
prevents us to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
the drug-induced transcriptional variations. Considering the fact
that some drug targets are TFs, such as estrogen receptors (ERs),
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and gluco-
corticoid receptor (GR), we attempt to use the target information
of the module-coupled drugs to identify the TFs. Because biclus-
tering approach FABIA (factor analysis for bicluster acquisition)
has shown good performance in recognizing biclusters and has
been successfully used in identifying gene expression modules
and associated TFs (Gu and Liu, 2008; Hochreiter et al.,
2010), we used FABIA to generate drug-induced transcriptional
modules. In this study, a module is not only a set of genes
but also connected with a set of agents. So, a module is exactly
a bicluster. Then, we demonstrate that the modules are of
biological relevance in terms of functional enrichment, drugi
drug interactions (DDIs) and 3D proximity in chromatins.
Finally, we identify the TFs for some modules, by which
we reveal some new mechanisms for metabolic regulation, and
elucidate the polypharmacological mechanisms for some natural
products.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data preprocessing

The raw data were downloaded from connectivity map (cMap) (Lamb
et al., 2006), which consist of 7056 gene chips corresponding to ﬁve
cultured human cell lines treated with 1309 agents.

Each chemical treatment chip had a vehicle control pair. The data were
ﬁrst normalized by Robust Multi-array Average expression measure.
Amplitude (a), a parameter merging the treatment and control data,
was used to measure the extent of the differential expression of a given
probe set (Lamb et al., 2006). The deﬁnition of a is as follows:

[—6

“20+oﬂ

where t is the expression value for the treatment and c is the expression
value for the control. If a> 0, the expression is increased on treatment; if
a<0, the expression is decreased on treatment. However, if a=0, no
change in the expression is observed.

For each agent, the median of expression values determined under
different conditions was applied to represent the expression proﬁle.
This merged the 7056 expression proﬁles into 1309 agent-speciﬁc tran-
scriptional response proﬁles, constituting a matrix of 22 215 rows (probes)

and 1309 columns (agents). Each column was normalized using the fol-

lowing equation:

xj. = —x’7 _ xi (2)
J S].

where xi) is the expression value in row i and column j, xj is the mean

value of column j and sj is the standard deviation of column j.

2.2 Biclustering analysis

The FABIA method was used to perform biclustering analysis
(Hochreiter et al., 2010). The outer product AZT of two sparse vectors
with p bicluster results in a matrix X. The model for the matrix X is as
follows:

P
X = X) 1.2,? + y (3)
i:l

where the real numbers 2,, 2,-T and y correspond to a prototype column
vector for genes, sample participating in the i bicluster and the additive
noise, respectively. FABIA 2.2.2 software was used to search K biclusters
of 222le 1309 matrix. K (number of biclusters) was set to 50. The
sparseness factor was set to 0.1 and the number of iterations was set to
10 000. When K 3 49, the biclusters covered all the information contents
of the matrix. To simplify the presentation of bicluster results, we used
1 or 0 to represent the coupling or not of a bicluster to a speciﬁc agent,
where 1 implies the z values> 0.

2.3 Gene function enrichment

Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(Huang et al., 2009) was used to indicate Gene Ontology (GO) and
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) information
associated with genes in modules, respectively.

2.4 Drug target enrichment for modules
The drug target enrichment for each module was evaluated by a cumu-

lative hypergeometric test (Iorio et al., 2010). The P-value was calculated
using the following equation:

(KW—K)
regexi (4)

 (r)

where N is the total number of drugs used in the target enrichment
signiﬁcance evaluation (i.e. 477), M is the number of drugs in the
module, 1' is the number of drugs sharing the same target in N and K is
the number of drugs sharing the same target in M. Thus, we can calculate
the probability by chance, at least x occurrences of a target among those
associated with the module.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We used the cMap as the starting database, which contains 7056
genome-wide expression profiles of ﬁve different human cell lines
treated with 1309 chemical agents at different dosages (Lamb
et al., 2006). Because most of the drug-induced transcriptional
modules are conserved across cell lines (Iskar et al., 2013), the
7056 expression profiles were merged into 1309 agent-speciﬁc
profiles. Then, the FABIA software (Hochreiter et al., 2010)
was used to search K biclusters that correspond to the functional
modules. When K was 349, superﬂuous biclusters were pushed
toward zero, which means that the modules contained all the

information from the 1309 samples (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Thus, the present analysis was based on 49 modules, which
consisted of 5921 probes and were ordered according to their
information contents. That is, module 1 contains the richest
information and module 49 contains the poorest. On average,
each module covers 324:l: 10.6 agents, each agent is associated
with 12.1 :I: 5.3 modules (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Because different modules have different biological functions
(see later in the text for details), the module profiles of the
agents allow us to dissect their polypharmacological mechanisms.

The biological functions of each module were deﬁned by en-
riched genes recorded in GO and KEGG pathways. The 49 mod-
ules have signiﬁcant GO enrichments, with 46 having significant
KEGG enrichments (Supplementary Table S1). Most modules
concentrate on a few functions, and both GO terms and KEGG
pathway annotations match well with each other, indicating the
functional convergence of the modules.

Further evidence to demonstrate the biological relevance of
gene modules comes from DDIs. The occurrence of DDIs
means that the pharmacologic effect of a given drug is inﬂuean
by the action of another. Drug pairs that form DDIs usually
have a high probability to share common targets (Huang et al.,
2013). Through searching DrugBank (Wishart, 2008), we ob-
tained 7516 pairs of DDIs. It is interesting to note that DDIs
are signiﬁcantly enriched for drugs covered by the same module
(Supplementary Table S3, cumulative hypergeometric test), indi-
cating the strong pharmacologic associations among the drugs.

To investigate whether the modules are associated with tran-
scriptional regulation, we used the data of interaction regions
for RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) determined by chromatin
interaction analysis using paired-end tags (ChIA-PET)
(Li et al., 2012), which deﬁned close and distant regulatory elem-
ents directly interacting with gene promoters. The raw data were
downloaded from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ChIA-PET
datasets (Li et al., 2012), which consist of data for five different
human cell lines and were merged for use in this study. The genes
of each module were mapped into the anchor regions of RNAPII
(i.e. 2.5 kb upstream and downstream of interaction regions for
RNAPII), according to the procedure reported previously
(Sandhu et al., 2012). Promoteripromoter interactions were sig-
niﬁcantly enriched for the genes within the same module
(Supplementary Fig. S2, cumulative hypergeometric test), imply-
ing that these genes tend to be proximate in 3D structure of
chromatins and thus to be transcribed cooperatively (Sandhu
et al., 2012).

The target information of module-coupled drugs was used to
identify the TFs linked to the modules. We retrieved 573
approved drugs (hitting 536 targets) from 1309 agents by search-
ing DrugBank (W ishart, 2008) and Therapeutic Target Database
(Zhu et al., 2012) and found that 209 targets were shared by at
least two drugs. These targets and corresponding 477 drugs can
be used for target enrichment to validate the coupling between
targets and gene modules (Iorio et al., 2010). The results show
that 168 targets can be enriched for 49 modules (P<0.01,
q<0.01) (Supplementary Table S4, cumulative hypergeometric
test), in which 11 are TFs, corresponding to 28 modules (Fig. 1).
In particular, the links between ER): and its associated modules
can be further validated by the interactions between ER): and its
target promoters.

It has been broadly accepted that although genomic informa-
tion is recorded in a linear series of bases, gene regulation occurs
in 3D structure of chromatins (Fullwood et al., 2009). Because
ChIA-PET can efﬁciently determine the spatial enhanceri
promoter interactions, the ChIA-PET-derived long-range chr0-
matin interactions between the ERa-bound regions and their
target promoters are appropriate to verify the ER): module
relationships (Fullwood et al., 2009). We mapped the genes in
49 modules into the anchor regions bound by ER): [i.e. 20 kb
within transcription start site to interaction regions, deﬁned by
Fullwood et a]. (2009)] and found that module 42 is richest in
potential target genes regulated by ERa, with 66.4% (99/149)
probes being potential ERa targets (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Modules 22 and 47 are also rich in ERa-regulated genes
(P<0.00001, cumulative hypergeometric test) (Supplementary
Fig. S2). These three modules are assigned to ER): by drug
target enrichment.

It is interesting to note that 7 ER): agonist drugs contained in
1309 agents are all coupled with module 42 (Supplementary
Table S5), which provides further evidence to support the link
between module 42 and ER): regulation. Thus, it is reasonable to
infer that other agents covered by module 42 are highly possible
to stimulate ERa. Through searching the adverse drug events
database MetaADED (http://www.lmmd.org/0nline_services/
metaadedb/), it was found that 22 of 93 approved drugs covered
by module 42 have side effect of gynecomastia (Supplementary

Table S6), supporting their ERa stimulation potential. Besides,
the agents enriched by module 42 include 9 plant polyphenols
(i.e. butein, (—)—catechin, genistein, hesperetin, kaempferol,
luteolin, naringenin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid and resveratrol)
(Supplementary Table S5), in good agreement with their widely
recognized biological effects as phytoestrogens (Kuiper et al.,
1998).

As illustrated in Figure 1, some modules are coupled with
multiple TFs. For instance, module 4 is regulated by ERa,
ERﬂ and GR. GR is well known for its regulation role in lipid
metabolism H u et al., 2010). Module 4 is tightly linked to lipid
metabolism, with 37 of 65 genes involved in this process, accord-
ing to KEGG and GO annotations (P<0.0001) (Supplementary
Table S1). Thus, it is reasonable to infer that ERa also plays a
role in lipid metabolism regulation. In all, 5 of the 37 genes
(i.e. ACLY, FASN, ELOVL6, MVD and DHCR7) have been
reported to participate in lipid metabolism and be regulated by
ER): (Villa et al., 2012). The remaining 32 genes are thus tenta-
tively inferred to be regulated by ER): in a direct or indirect
manner. The ChIA-PET data for ER): indicate that 3 of 32
genes, i.e. AACS, NPCI and FDFTI, are directly regulated by
ERa. Furthermore, we established the proteiniprotein inter-
action relationships of 37 genes by extracting the proteiniprotein
interaction information (including known and predicted) from
the STRING network with intermediate to high conﬁdence
(the default STRING evidence scores>0.4) (Franceschini
et al., 2013). As shown in Figure 2, there exist strong connections
between the ﬁve recognized genes and other genes involved in
lipid metabolism, supportive of the ER): regulation of these
genes. Thus, the TF-based analysis of gene responses to drugs
is helpful to reveal new mechanisms for metabolic regulation and
produce testable hypotheses.

For TFs that have not been used as drug targets, we can
establish their links with modules by retrieving information of
biological regulation. According to KEGG annotations, module
36 is tightly associated with glutathione metabolism (P<0.0001)
(Supplementary Table S1), which is regulated by nuclear factor
(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). This module contains the
genes for glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPXZ) and ferritin heavy
polypeptide 1 (FTHI), as well as all of the antioxidant genes
controlled by Nrf2, including GCLM, GCLC, NQOI,
HM 0X 1, GSR and PRDXI (Kaidery et al., 2013). Thus, there
exists a close link between module 36 and Nrf2, which means
that the 189 agents coupled with this module are potential redox
regulators (Supplementary Table S7). Some well-known antioxi-
dants, such as ascorbic acid and ebselen, are included in this list.
Moreover, the 189 agents involve 4 para-quinones (i.e. tanespi-
mycin, 1,4—chrysenequin0ne, menadione and tetroquinone),
which abstract electrons and protons from the thiols of Keapl,
an important negative regulator of Nrf2, resulting in the activa-
tion of Nrf2 (Abiko et al., 2011).

Six polyphenols, i.e. quercetin, butein, nordihydroguaiaretic
acid, myricetin, kaempferol and genistein, are included in this
list, suggesting that these polyphenols can serve as redox regula-
tors through activating Nrf2 in relatively low concentrations (low
micromolar, recorded in cMap). Although natural polyphenols
have long been touted as direct radical scavengers, accumulating
evidence indicates that their health beneﬁts are not likely to
come from radical-neutralizing activity because their poor

Fig. 2. Proteiniprotein interaction network of 37 lipid metabolism-
associated genes in module 4 (derived from STRING). Five of the
genes (in green) have been reported to participate in lipid metabolism
and be regulated by EROt (Villa et al., 2012). Others (in orange) are also
likely to be regulated by EROt in a direct or indirect manner

bioavailability prevents them to reach high concentrations (high
micromolar) to compete with in vivo antioxidants such as Vita-
mins C and E (Halliwell et al., 2005). Therefore, the present
ﬁnding provides solid evidence to support the opinion that nat-
ural polyphenols are more likely indirect antioxidants than direct
radical modulators (Halliwell et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2010).
Interestingly, genistein, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, butein and
kaempferol are also enriched by module 42, which means that
these polyphenols have both antioxidant and estrogen effects.
Previous studies have revealed that the side effects of ER): agon-
ists are associated with the stimulated production of reactive
oxygen species (Okoh et al., 2013). Thus, antioxidant and estro-
gen-like activities of natural polyphenols may be responsible for
their safety in long-term consumption. Besides modules 42 and
36, these polyphenols are linked to many other modules
(Supplementary Table S2), in which modules 11, 48, 10, 25, 3
and 37 are most common and are linked to ERs, DAXl, PPARy
and other TFs (Fig. 1). Although it remains unknown whether
polyphenols activate DAXl, genestein and kaempferol have been
recognized as PPARy agonists (O’Leary et al., 2004; Zhang
et al., 2013), and thus are cell cycle and apoptosis modulators
with chemoprevention potential (Theocharis et al., 2004).
Therefore, the well-known health beneﬁts of polyphenols includ-
ing estrogen-like, antihyperlipidemia and anticancer effects
(Gil-Izquierdo et al., 2012; Messina et al., 2009; Tham et al.,
1998) can be explained, at least in part, in terms of their poten-
tials in activating speciﬁc TFs, such as ERs, Nrf2 and PPARy.
In summary, by using drug target information and accumu-
lated biological regulation information, we can establish the links
between drug-associated gene modules and some TFs. Some of
the links are supported by 3D transcriptional regulation data

(derived from ChIA-PET experiments) and drug MoA as well.
Based on the complex relationships between modules and TFs,
we can get new insights into biological regulation, in particular,
the lipid metabolism regulation by ERa. Because natural agents
usually stimulate multiple TFs, the polypharmacological mech-
anisms for these agents (e. g. polyphenols) can be partially eluci-
dated in terms of activation of speciﬁc TFs. However, it should
bear in mind that the present analysis was performed by merging
expression proﬁles of different cell lines, which means that the
present results revealed the fundamental links between drugs,
TFs and regulated genes, rather than the cell line-dependent
features of drug MoA. A more detailed exploration on this
topic will be accomplished with the accumulation of biological
regulation information, which will offer deeper insights into
drug MoA.

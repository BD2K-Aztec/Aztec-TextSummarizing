ABSTRACT

Motivation: This website allows the detection of horizontal transfers
based on a combination of parametric methods and proposes an
origin by researching neighbors in a bank of genomic signatures.
This bank is also used to research an origin to DNA fragments from
metagenomics studies.

Results: Different services are provided like the possibility of
inferring a phylogenetic tree with sequence signatures or comparing
two genomes and displaying the rearrangements that happened
since their separation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Horizontal transfers (HTS) are a major force of evolution (Keeling
and Palmer, 2008; Ochman et (11., 2000) and this website
proposes methods for their detection. The genomic signature was
demonstrated to be species-speciﬁc (Deschavanne et al., 1999;
Sandberg et al., 2001) and allows HT detection in terms of
tetranucleotide frequencies (Dufraigne et al., 2005). Parametric
methods were designed to work only with the information contained
in genomic sequences. They rely either on the whole set of genes or
on local variations of genomic signature (Dufraigne et al., 2005;
Mallet et (11., 2010). Recently, a benchmark has determined the
most efﬁcient parametric methods in different conditions and has
proposed to use a combination of methods to analyze HTs in
genomes (Becq et al., 2010). This site provides user-friendly access
to such methods as well as some unique features including signature-
based phylogeny and potential origin of a set of metagenomics
sequences.

2 GOHTAM SERVICES
2.1 HT detection

The two methods proposed can be used alone or in combination. The
ﬁrst is a window-based signature method as described in Dufraigne
et al. (2005), except that the distance used is the Jensen—Shannon
divergence, a symmetric version of the Kullback—Leibler divergence
(Azad and Lawrence, 2007; Becq et al., 2010). Either sensitivity
or speciﬁcity can be increased by adjustable classiﬁcation process
(Azad and Lawrence, 2007). A gene-based method is also proposed
with the same distance (Becq et (11., 2010). Up to now, these methods
were never proposed for online genome analysis (Fig. 1A).

2.2 Bank of genomic signatures

A key feature of GOHTAM is the biggest bank of genomic signatures
to date. Instead of using only complete genomes (van Passel et al.,
2005; Teeling et al., 2004), this bank is based on the whole
set of sequences of Genbank (release 188, only sequences <1 kb
were discarded) and contains ~248 000 tetranucleotide species
signatures. The bank is updated at each major release.

2.3 Origin of transferred regions

Each detected region signature is compared with the signatures of the
bank and the 10 closest neighbors are displayed with a conﬁdence
rating depending on the length of both query and reference sequences
and the distance between the two signatures (Fig. 1B).

2.4 Metagenomics

In the case of a metagenomics study, a sequence or a set of
sequences (multi-Fasta) is loaded; the signatures of these sequences
are compared as above to propose a species of origin.

2.5 Oligonucleotide content

The whole set of tetranucleotides of a sequence represents the
signature of a sequence (Deschavanne et (11., 1999). This signature
of the 256 possible tetranucleotides is under the form of a 16 X 16
frequency matrix and can be displayed as a signature image
(Fig. 1D).

2.6 Phylogenetic tree of sequence signatures

It was shown that the species speciﬁcity of genomic signatures could
be used to infer phylogenetic trees (Chapus et (11., 2005). Loading
a multi-Fasta ﬁle of sequences leads to build a neighbor-joining
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1C; Felsenstein, 2005).

2.7 Genome alignment

The website uses maximum unique matches (MUMs) to align
genomes. All rearrangements superiors to 1kb between two
genomes are graphically displayed with the possibility to choose
a region or modify the length of MUMs (Fig. 1E; Delcher et (11.
1999).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Except for use of programs like the Phylip package (http://evolution
.gs.washington.edu/phylip.html) or Mummer (http://mummer
.sourceforge.net/), the original programs are written in Python, Perl
or R and available at: http://gohtam.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr:8080/
Data/bin/GOHTAM_bin.tgz

An online help is available. Some analyses require time; HT
detection lasts ~6 min and the research for neighbors ~2 min
depending on the server load and the sequence length.

This site provides some unique features in terms of HT detection,
origin of HT regions, metagenomics studies as well as for

phylogenetic analyses of homologous or non-homologous sequences
due to its extended reference database and improves the analyses
proposed by other sites of genome analysis (van Passel et (11., 2005;
Teeling et (11., 2004).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Data collection in spreadsheets is ubiquitous, but current
solutions lack support for collaborative semantic annotation that
would promote shared and interdisciplinary annotation practices, sup-
porting geographically distributed players.

Results: OntoMaton is an open source solution that brings ontology
lookup and tagging capabilities into a cloud-based collaborative edit-
ing environment, harnessing Google Spreadsheets and the NCBO
Web services. It is a general purpose, format-agnostic tool that may
serve as a component of the ISA software suite. OntoMaton can also
be used to assist the ontology development process.

Availability: OntoMaton is freely available from Google widgets under
the CPAL open source license; documentation and examples at:
https://github.com/|SA-tools/OntoMaton.

1 INTRODUCTION

Well-annotated and shared bioscience research data offer new
discovery opportunities and drive science of the future. Several
data management plans and sharing policies have emerged,
along with a growing number of community-developed guide-
lines and ontologies to harmonize the reporting of experiments
from different domains so that these can be comprehensible and
in turn, reproducible and reusable. In many research projects
however, the generation and collection of experimental data
occur in a multicentric, distributed fashion; and a variety of
data types are generated often in a single experiment. Use of
spreadsheets and related editors, such as Microsoft Excel for
collecting experimental description is widespread among re-
searchers due to their ﬂexibility, low learning curve and above
all ubiquity of tooling. However, misalignment, conﬂicting ver-
sions, the heterogeneity of free text, and also silent and unwanted
‘auto-corrections’ are major shortcomings to be addressed
(Zeeberg et al., 2004). This scenario and the current budgetary
restrictions require ‘invest to save’ solutions to promote consist-
ent annotation and collaborative editing of bioscience experi-
ments, assisting researchers in complying with reporting
policies and community standards. OntoMaton is an open

source tool that leverages the collaborative environment and
editing functionalities brought by Google Spreadsheets, and pro-
vides access to ontology look-up and tagging functionalities
served by the NCBO BioPortal and Annotator web services
(Jonquet et al., 2010; Whetzel et al., 2011).

2 ONToMATON DESIGN AND USE CASES

Four main use cases drove the development of OntoMaton: (i) to
allow collaborative, distributed and coordinated annotation
while enabling configurations and restrictions to be deﬁned;
(ii) to reduce free text description in metadata tracking of experi-
mental data; (iii) to assist design patterns-based ontology devel-
opment by facilitating interaction with domain experts; and
(iv) to ease mapping between models and semantic representa-
tions. Two use cases are discussed more speciﬁcally in the next
sections: one insisting on the free form of the widget and its
ability to integrate in any layout, agnostic of any framework;
the other aligning with a standardization effort, the ISA syntax
(Sansone et al., 2012). While ontology-enabled standalone tools
exist (Rocca-Serra et al., 2011; Wolstencroft et al., 2011), they
lack collaborative features. OntoMaton, with the aid of the
Google Spreadsheet environment delivers this. OntoMaton is
implemented in JavaScript upon the Google App Script API
and accesses the NCBO RESTful web services. A webcast tutor-
ial of how to use it is available at http://goo.gl/FjghA.

3 COLLABORATIVE SEMANTIC ANNOTATION

The OntoMaton Google widget can be installed and invoked
from any Google Spreadsheet document or embedded in
Google Templates. It provides a facility for searching ontologies
hosted at NCBO BioPortal, or for calling a tagging functionality,
by relying on NCBO’s Annotator services (J onquet et al., 2010).
An OntoMaton-enabled Google spreadsheet can also be conﬁg-
ured to restrict the ontological search space to specific resources.
While OntoMaton is syntax neutral, its usefulness is demon-
strated when exploited by a data management infrastructure,
for instance to support the creation of ISA-Tab compatible tem-
plates. The ultimate goal is to foster adoption of reporting stand-
ard conformant spreadsheets for managing biological
experimental data description. Figure 1 provides detailed alter-
native uses of OntoMaton and a snippet of an experiment being
marked-up. Several data management projectsiwith an existing

4 COLLABORATIVE ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING

Developing ontologies and knowledge representation artefacts
requires the interaction of domain experts and computer scien-
tists. The core interaction consists of converting domain expert
vetted representations (aka a design pattern) to OWL represen-
tations through the intervention of knowledge engineers. Tools
such as Populous (Jupp et al., 2012) and Protege Mapping
Master (http://protege.stanford.edu) have been developed to sup-
port these activities. The developers of the Ontology of
Biomedical Investigations (OBI) (Brinkman et al., 2010), cur-
rently rely on the Quick Term Template (Rocca—Serra et al.,
2011) approach to quickly add deﬁned classes based on a tem-
plate and the Manchester OWL Syntax for the mapping.
However, owing to the collaborative nature of OBI development,
the approach has been hindered by the lack of tools. OntoMaton
closes this gap and several templates have now been documented
to support different design patterns. Those templates unfold the
restrictions of a class model in a table: fields correspond to facet
ﬁllers and cell values should be class names or URIs.

OntoMaton, by enabling in situ resource lookups, simpliﬁes de-
velopment, review and curation by the pool of OBI editors.

5 DISCUSSION

Developed by harnessing the Google Spreadsheet environment
and the term lookup and annotation power of the NCBO Web
services, OntoMaton is an effective tool assisting both collabora-
tive semantic annotation of experiments and the ontology devel-
opment process. Several annotation tools exist (Nelson et al.,
2011) but not all have support for community-driven guidelines
and ontologies, and none of them allow collaborative annota-
tion. Moreover, Excel-based tools (Jones and Cote, 2008) tend to
be platform and version dependent. Google Spreadsheets on the
other hand work across all platforms. A comparison of tools
attempting to mix spreadsheets with access to vocabulary servers
is available at http://goo.gl/NV3lZ. Ongoing development of
OntoMaton focuses on: (i) transformation of data into the
Resource Description Framework and Linked Data; (ii) support
for cell level, vocabulary drop-down list as soon as the Google
API supports it; and (iii) further integration with the ISA soft-
ware suite as requested by users.

where Nay) is the total number of ECs in all pathways that have
EC 1', Na”) is the number of unique ECs in all the pathways that
have EC 1' and Nam) is the total number of pathways where EC 1'
is present and L(UBC~r) is the total edge—length of the unbranched
chain containing EC 1' in the reference pathway.

The pathway completeness score for a pathway p is then

C _ ZieECpWi’kli’k L(UBC,s)

where W,— is the speciﬁcity weight of each EC 1' in pathway p, and
I,- is 1 if the EC number is detected in the sample and Lamas) is
the edge—length of the unbranched chain containing EC 1' in the
sample.

Odds ratio for gene enrichment: As described in Gill et a].
(2006), if A and C are the occurrence counts of a given EC in
sample 1' and all other comparison samples j, respectively, and B
and D are occurrence counts of all other ECs in sample 1' and
comparison samples j, respectively, then the odds ratio for the
given EC in sample 1' is (A/B)/(C/D).

Pathway Activity Score: This is simply the sum of counts for
the ECs in a given pathway multiplied by the EC weight.

Equalization of sequencing effort: To remove bias introduced
by differences in sequencing effort, the user can equalize unequal
sample sizes to the smallest sample by randomly selecting equal
numbers from the other samples.

Custom-designed pathways: In addition to the KEGG path—
ways, the users can design their own pathways in the Pathway
Designer. Chemical species and EC numbers can be placed on a
grid and linked with lines. The customized pathways can then be
added to any project in FROMP.

Input: Apart from reading the output of the hmmscan program
(Eddy, 1998), FROMP can also read in tab— or comma—separated
list of EC numbers and Pfam accession numbers (one column),
ECs and Pfams with counts (two column) and ECs and Pfams
with counts and sequence IDs (three column) of the meta—omic
sequences. It also accepts a matrix ﬁle of EC counts, with the
samples arranged in columns and the EC numbers in the rows.

Output: The comparative recruitment of various samples on
the reference pathways can be exported as PNG image files. The
various score matrices (including the EC count matrix) for the
samples and the sequence IDs of the fragments mapping onto
each EC or pathway can also be exported as text ﬁles.

3 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF
METATRANSCRIPTOMES FROM THE OXYGEN
MINIMUM ZONE OFF PERU

Three metatranscriptomic samples from a depth proﬁle (oxic,
oxycline and anoxic), collected from one station in the
Peruvian oxygen minimum zone, were analysed with FROMP
and mapped onto a custom—designed pathway that included bio—
logical reactions that are thought to be carried out in
oxygen—depleted environments (Supplementary Figs S27S4).
The oxic sample metabolism was dominated by sequences
afﬁliated to oxic respiration (cytochrome—c oxidase, EC

1.9.3.1). It also had elevated levels of nitrite reduction transcripts
(EC 1.7.2.1), while sequences from the oxycline and the an—
oxic samples exclusively mapped onto nitrate reductases (EC
1.7.99.4). In the sulfur cycle, sequences similar to hydrogen sul—
frte reductase (EC 1.8.99.3) mostly originated from the anoxic
depth, while the sulfate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.4) was
most abundant in the oxic surface. These visual observations
are also supported by the odds ratio or enrichment factors cal—
culated for the ECs in these samples (Supplementary Fig. S5).

4 CONCLUSION

profiling of meta—omic data. The java program FROMP and the

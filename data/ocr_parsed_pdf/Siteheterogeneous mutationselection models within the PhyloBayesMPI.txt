3 EXAMPLE

We present an example that we could not run with our previous
implementation. consisting of 401 sequences of the PB2 gene of
inﬂuenza. taken from Tamuri ()l a]. (2012). With the present
implementation. we obtained a sample of 1100 draws within
~5 h. running on a 12 core (hyper-threaded). Intel i7-based
workstation. Disearding the first 100 draws. we display the pos-
terior mean distributions of selection coefﬁcients (S) in Figure 1.

Looking at panel a. we find that the highest-valued bin is that
of synonymous events (S: 0). most mutations (red) are deleteri-
ous (S<0) and most substitutions (green) are either neutral (syn-
onymous) or nearly neutral. Whereas the “infinitely many
parameters” approach used by Tamuri ()l a]. (2012) led to the
conclusion that most nonsynonymous mutations have
S< i 10. panel b shows that most have a selection coefficient
between 710 and 72. with the mode situated at 75. The red
distribution. however. seems more plausible than that obtained
using a parametric site-specific approach (Rodrigue. 2013).
which inferred most nonsynonymous events with S between 0
and 75.

Panel c displays a site-specific assessment of the distributions
of S for nonsynonymous mutations. focusing on the first 100
eodons of the alignment. For graphical simplicity. we have
added up the values over a few sets of classes. The
710<S 5 72 class. in blue. is the most representedias previ-
ously revealed from panel bibut some sites. e. g. eodon 75. have
almost as many nonsynonymous mutations in the nearly neutral
class. 72<S 5 2. indicating that they are under less stringent
evolutionary constraints than other sites.

4 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Our implementation enables numerous potential applications.
For instance. the last panel of Figure 1 suggests studies on the
distributions of S over classes of sites. Distributions could even be
generated for all possible types of nonsynonymous mutations at
each site. The software could also serve in the development of
approaches that explicitly incorporate structural features (e.g.
Meyer and Wilke. 2013). and already includes mutation-selection
models using finite mixtures. homogeneous versions and models
based on a univariate factor on nonsynonymous rates ((o).
Applications of these models will be the focus of future papers.
Developed within the PhyloBayes-MPI package. the models
we have implemented here inherit the ability to perform a variety
of types of posterior predictive model assessments. cross-valid-
ation comparisons. ancestral sequence reconstruction. as well as
phylogenetic inference per so. Much more work is needed in these
contexts. to assess what insights may be gained from the muta-
tion-selection framework. and from eodon substitution models in
general. The present application should help engage such work.

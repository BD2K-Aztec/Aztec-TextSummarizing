ABSTRACT

Motivation: Changes in the copy number of chromosomal DNA
segments [copy number variants (CNVs)] have been implicated in
human variation, heritable diseases and cancers. Microarray-based
platforms are the current established technology of choice for studies
reporting these discoveries and constitute the benchmark against
which emergent sequence-based approaches will be evaluated.
Research that depends on CNV analysis is rapidly increasing, and
systematic platform assessments that distinguish strengths and
weaknesses are needed to guide informed choice.

Results: We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of six
platforms, provided by four leading vendors, using a spike-in
experiment. NimbleGen and Agilent platforms outperformed Illumina
and Affymetrix in accuracy and precision of copy number dosage
estimates. However, Illumina and Affymetrix algorithms that leverage
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information make up for this
disadvantage and perform well at variant detection. Overall, the
NimbleGen 2.1M platform outperformed others, but only with the
use of an alternative data analysis pipeline to the one offered by
the manufacturer.

1 INTRODUCTION

Copy number variant (CNV) loci are a major source of variation
observed among human genomes (Conrad et al., 2009; Hurles

et al., 2008). While some CNVs have no known functional
consequence, some are associated with inherited microdeletion or
microduplication syndromes (Carter, 2007; Lee and Lupski, 2006;
McCarroll and Altshuler, 2007; Scherer et al., 2007). High-density
microarrays permit the measurement of DNA copy number variation
across the genome with broad coverage of all Chromosomes and
high resolution. Approaches based on high-throughput sequencing
technology have been tried (Gilad et al., 2009) and are very
promising. However, at this time genome sequence-based detection
of CNVs is not yet a competitive strategy in terms of costs,
availability of established analysis tools for general use and wealth
of published performance appraisal from experience. The several
microarray-based platforms for CNV detection that have been
developed are currently subject to active price and performance
competition. Research and Clinical laboratories are seeking to
determine the technology platform(s) that perform best for detection
of CNVs: accurately and precisely reporting their length, their copy
number and other features such as homozygosity. Here we provide
an assessment of the major vendors in the current marketplace based
on direct comparison of the performance of samples containing
intentional copy number alterations. These are evaluated using
company-recommended software tools, as well as independent
methods.

CNVs spanning one megabase (Mb) are detectable by cytogenetic
techniques such as spectral karyotyping and ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization. However, the level of resolution attained by these
methods does not permit detection of copy number Change in
smaller segments. Microarray comparative genomic hybridization
(array-CGH) was the ﬁrst technique developed to achieve a
higher resolution (Lucito et (11., 2003; Pinkel et (11., 1998; Pollack
et al., 1999). In this technology, DNA from a test sample and
a reference sample are labeled using different ﬂuorophores (Cy3
and CyS), and hybridized to probes printed on a glass slide.
The log-ratio of the ﬂuorescence intensity of the test to that
of the reference DNA is calculated and used as a measure of

relative dosage. However, the level of random variation in these
log-ratios does not permit copy number calls at the individual
feature level. Therefore, analysts use smoothing, a statistical
procedure that averages neighboring measurements to improve
precision (Fig. 1a). With smoothing techniques, precision, and
therefore speciﬁcity, can be improved by increasing the size of the
averaging window, but at a cost of averaging over, and therefore
missing, smaller CNVs. Competing statistical techniques provide
different solutions to this sensitivity—speciﬁcity tradeoff. Examples
are hidden Markov models (Colella et (11., 2007; Greenman
et (11., 2010; Korn et (11., 2008; Scharpf et (11., 2008; Wang
et (11., 2007) and segmentation algorithms such as Circular binary
segmentation (CBS) (Olshen et (11., 2004). Note that speciﬁcity
can be improved without detrimentally affecting sensitivity by
increasing the resolution of the array, because the number of
averaged points increases when keeping the neighborhood sizes the
same (averaging window sizes). Recently, Agilent and NimbleGen
have developed high-resolution microarrays, with roughly 1 million
or 2 million features respectively, in which the oligonucleotide
features are Chosen to represent a tiling path through the human
genome.

In parallel development, genotyping arrays from Illumina and
Affymetrix originally designed for genome-wide genotyping of
SNPs (Di et (11., 2005; Kennedy et (11 ., 2003) were adapted to provide
CNV calls providing both polymorphic and non-polymorphic
elements (Redon et (11., 2006). The most recent platforms contain
features for >1 million SNPs, and translate to a resolution of one
feature per ~3000 bps. For each SNP, these platforms provide an
intensity-based measurement for each allele, denoted generally as
A and B. While the ratio of these intensities (A: B) is used for
genotyping, the sum (A+ B) provides a quantitative measure of
copy number dosage. If a reference sample is available, then we
can form a ratio as in array-CGH and use the same smoothing
techniques (Hupe et (11., 2004; Lai et (11., 2005). The Affymetrix
6.0 platform includes 906 600 SNP probes as well as 945 806 non-
polymorphic probes used strictly for CNV detection to roughly
double the resolution. In their latest product, the Affymetrix 2.7M
array includes many more CNV features (2 394 920 compared to
400103 SNP features). Algorithms developed by Illumina and
Affymetrix make Clever use of the bi-allelic information from SNP
probes to detect copy number Change. For example, Illumina deﬁnes
the B-allele frequency (BAF) as the estimated number of B alleles
divided by the sum of both alleles at a given SNP location. This
estimate is based upon interpolation from plotted canonical Clusters
of the AA, AB and BB genotypes at a given SNP, with the x-axis
representing B to A allelic intensity ratios and the y-axis representing
B + A intensity sums (Staaf et (11., 2008; Steemers and Gunderson,
2007). The expectation, when copy number dosage is 2, is to see
three Clouds of points when plotting BAF across the genome: one
Cloud for each genotype AA, AB and BB. CNVs can be detected
by looking for regions with an unexpected number of Clusters in
the BAF measure even in cases where the dosage measure does not
show strong signal (Fig. 1b shows intensity (A+ B); Fig. 10 shows
BAF).

In this work, we compare performance on the six platforms listed
in Table 1. This set consists of one SNP genotyping, three array-
CGH, and two hybrid array platforms, i.e. platforms in which a
substantial number of probes are non-polymorphic. To guide the
comparison we developed a spike-in experiment in which known
genomic fragments were added in varying quantities to diploid
lymphoblastoid genomic DNA samples from two individuals with
known large deletions. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was
used to estimate the concentration of bacterial artiﬁcial Clones
(BACs) containing between 141 and 217 kb of human genomic
DNA. Four spike-in cocktails were prepared according to a modiﬁed
Latin square design. Actual relative representation of BAC insert in
each cocktail was determined as read number per base in single-
end sequence output from a Solexa Genome Analyzer. The four
spike-in reagents were added to lymphoblastoid genomic DNA, and
each DNA sample was hybridized in replicate to each of the six
platforms (Table 2, Methods in Supplementary Material). Sample
labeling, hybridization, and scanning were performed at publicly
accessible laboratory service sites with recognized expertise, and all
protocols conformed to company-speciﬁed recommendations. Data
were analyzed in two modes: one based on company-recommended
software for detection of CNV calls and one independent of
company-recommended software to evaluate the speciﬁcity and
sensitivity of CNV and dosage measurements. We also evaluated
the ﬁdelity of the start and end estimates of CNV regions detected
in each platform.

2 METHODS

To facilitate raw data comparisons across platforms, we created a log-
ratio statistic, in log; scale, proportional to the copy number dosage.
For consistency with other microarray comparison publications (Irizarry
et (11., 2005) we denoted the statistic with M. A value of M :0 was
associated with a copy number 2 and for every dosage doubling/halving;
M was expected to increase/decrease by one. We obtained an M-Value
for each sample on each array feature. We also ran the default CNV
detection algorithms provided by the array vendors. To support in-
depth evaluation of platform performance, we distinguished between the
feature-level measurements provided by our M statistic and the lists of
genomic segments with associated dosage estimates provided by the default
algorithms.

These studies were performed with approval of the Johns Hopkins
Institutional Review Board and with informed consent of the families from
whom DNA was obtained.

2.1 Experimental design

The overall experimental design is summarized in Table 2 with details in
Methods in Supplementary Material. Brieﬂy, two human genomic DNAs
received spike-in mixes containing BAC clones in a modiﬁed Latin Square
conﬁguration. The experimental design also included technical replicates,
i.e. independent labeling and array hybridizations of the same preparation of
genomic DNA containing a spike-in panel.

Table 2. A modiﬁed Latin square design was used to generate four human
genomic samples (rows, Tubes 141) with known change at speciﬁc loci

In this study, 11 loci modiﬁed by addition of BAC clones (indicated by Roswell Park
accession number, top row) were analyzed in regards to TP versus coverage detection
as well as actual versus estimated start and end of spiked-in regions. These are the ﬁrst
11 BAC clones listed in this table, from top. All BAC clones listed in this table were
analyzed to determine dosage estimates. Values indicate nominal ﬁnal copy number at
each position after mixture with the cell line DNAs indicated. ‘NA’ in the accession
number row indicates deletion loci detected using ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH). BAC clones spiked-in over the deletion loci, which are the last three BAC
clones listed in this table, were analyzed in regards to TP versus coverage detection of
deletion regions.

2.2 Preparation of DNA samples

Lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained from anonymized individuals were
chosen for the presence of large copy number aberrations characterized by
methods other than microarray hybridization (Pevsner,J., unpublished). Cell
line 1133 was from a male with a hemizygous deletion on Chromosome
21. Cell line 1928 was from a female with a hemizygous deletion on
Chromosome 22 as well as an ampliﬁcation on Chromosome 6p. Bacterial
stocks containing clones from the human male BAC library RPCI-ll were
purchased from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. DNA was isolated by
standard methods (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and purity was assured by
the presence of BamHI digest fragments at equimolar representation, and by
unambiguous sequence reads from the BAC ends using T7 and SP6 primers.
DNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometer at A250, and by
real-time qPCR using a universal primer pair that ampliﬁed a vector segment.
The qPCR measurements were used to adjust each BAC concentration to
achieve the same number of molecules per microliter.

Four mixtures of BAC DNAs were assembled for addition to genomic
DNA in Tubes 141 (Methods in Supplementary Material). Within each BAC
mix, the relative representation of four different BAC DNAs was determined
by qPCR based on primer pairs that recognize sites in human genomic
DNA and that have similar reaction efﬁciencies. Then, the BAC mixes were
added to genomic DNA and qPCR was again used to check the relative
representation of four BAC locations within each genomic DNA sample.

2.3 Second-generation BAC sequencing

For each of the four BAC mixtures, the DNA sequence was obtained using
Solexa/Illumina 1G (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) at the Johns Hopkins
Genetics Core Resources Facility. For this, a library was made for each spike-
in mix using the Illumina genomic DNA sample preparation kit according
to instructions.

2.4 Values used in accuracy assessment

In the Section 3, we plot observed versus expected dosage estimate. For the
observed values we calculated the average M -Value across all points within
the spiked-in region. For the expected values we used second generation BAC
sequencing. For two of the BAC mixtures, DNA sequence was obtained
using Solexa/Illumina 1G (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) at the Johns
Hopkins Genetics Core Resources Facility. For this, a single-end library
was made for the spike-in mixes using the Illumina genomic DNA sample
prep kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. For two BAC mixtures, we
obtained single lane yields of 145 658 and 110542 kb (with read lengths of
36 nucleotides) and average fold depth of coverage of 39.5 X and 29.6><. The
reads from each sample were mapped to the spiked-in regions on the hg18
build using Bowtie (Langmead et (11., 2009) with default parameters. Note
that under default parameters, if a read had multiple matches, one was chosen
at random. We then computed the reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) for
each region. We added an offset to RPKM values, for plotting purposes, to
account for lack of genomic DNA in the sequenced BAC mixtures (explained
further in Methods in Supplementary Material). For the results presented in
Section 3.1 we included only autosomal data.

2.5 Microarray data acquisition

We submitted DNA samples to core facilities that are accessible to the
biomedical research community. In all cases, the laboratories running
the arrays were not provided access to the information in Table 2, and
performed the experiments in a blind fashion. A reference DNA was
recommended for two-color analyses on NimbleGen and Agilent arrays,
and male DNA from Promega (catalog #G147A) was used. For each
platform, a company-recommended analysis was performed to produce lists
of detected CNV regions. For Affymetrix, Agilent and Illumina platforms,
array data, analysis parameters and results were shared with the company
for assent that data quality was acceptable and analysis parameters were
within recommendation. NimbleGen performed analysis on site as part of
their microarray service. An independent analysis was performed in parallel
using the following steps.

2.6 Preprocessing

For the array-CGH arrays, NimbleGen and Agilent, we used loess
normalization (Yang et (11., 2002) Via LIMMA: Linear Models for Microarray
Data (Smyth, 2005). The SNP and hybrid arrays were preprocessed using
CRLMM: the Corrected Robust Linear Model with Maximum Likelihood
Distance (Carvalho et (11., 2007; Ritchie et (11., 2009) to obtain allele A and B
intensity summaries. For the SNP features we considered the sum (1 =A+ B)
as a dosage estimate. To obtain M -Values for the Affymetrix 6.0 and Illumina
1M Duo platforms we used a library of reference arrays, obtained from the
microarray core, to create a pseudo-reference array. This library included 75
individuals for Affymetrix 6.0 and 39 individuals for Illumina 1M Duo, taken
from HapMap samples. The Illumina 1M Duo library samples were run the
same month as the spike-in samples and the Affymetrix 6.0 library samples
were run in a range of 141 months prior to the spike-in samples. For each
feature we obtained the median, across arrays, of the I=A+B values. We
then took the log; ratio of the test sample versus the pseudo-reference value.
For the Affymetrix 2.7M platform, the manufacturer processed the data in a
similar way, using their own reference samples and removed 653 155 probes
known to be problematic.

2.7 Wave effect removal

For removal of the wave effect, described in detail in Section 3.1, features on
each platform were divided into groups so that the largest gap between any
two probes was <25 kb. For each of these groups we then ﬁtted a curve to
the M -Values plotted across the genome using loess (Cleveland, 1979) with
a neighborhood span of le. The estimated curves were then subtracted
from M to create wave-corrected M -Values. For CNV detection, we created
lists of regions based on our own pre-processed data by applying CBS, with

default parameters, to wave-corrected M -Values. The mean M -Value in each
of the detected regions was used as an estimate of percent dosage increase
(in log; scale).

2.8 CNV detection sensitivity and speciﬁcity

As some of the company-recommended algorithms did not include
procedures to detect CNVs in the X and Y chromosomes, we removed
these spiked-in BACs from this analysis. Furthermore, we focused on the
regions known to have ampliﬁcations because every algorithm easily found
all, or nearly all, deletions. We combined the results from all eight samples,
which resulted in a total of 64 true positive (TP) regions. All platforms
contained probes in all spiked-in regions and probe density was sufﬁcient
on all platforms to detect spike-ins for all regions on at least some of the
eight samples.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Waves

The presence of large-scale technical artifacts, referred to as waves,
has been reported for array-CGH data (Marioni et (11., 2007).
These authors report that removing this artifact is critical for the
development of a novel model-based CNV calling algorithm. Others
report the same observation for high-resolution arrays (van de Wiel
et (11., 2009) and SNP genotyping arrays (Diskin et (11., 2008).
However, except the software for Affymetrix 2.7, we found that
company-recommended default algorithms did not include data
analytic steps to remove waves (Fig. 2a). We estimated and removed
the wave effects using a loess smoother (Marioni et (11., 2007) as
described in detail in the Section 2. The estimated waves curve for
Agilent 1M had the largest amplitude followed by the NimbleGen
2.1M, NimbleGen 3x720K and Affymetrix 6.0 arrays (Fig. 2b).
The wave effect was substantially smaller for the Illumina 1M
Duo and Affymetrix 2.7M platforms; apart from Illumina 1M Duo
and Affymetrix 2.7M, we also found high correlation between the
estimated wave effects in all platforms and genomic GC-content
(Fig. 2b and c, Table 3). An interesting ﬁnding was that, in general,
Illumina data did not show wave effects except for one sample (Tube
2, replicate B) for which the correlation with GC-content was 0.79.
For the feature-level analyses presented in this section, we removed
the estimated wave effects for all platforms. Note that for the Agilent
arrays the effect was higher in one set of replicates (Fig. 2b).

3.2 Accuracy

The spike-in experiment permitted an assessment of accuracy; an
assessment not currently found in the literature. We used second
generation sequence data to support a precise measurement of BAC
elements within the spike-in reagents as described in the Section 2.
Therefore, each spiked-in region had an expected relative dosage
within each sample. We plotted the observed versus expected log
(base 2) dosages and noticed the expected linear pattern for all
platforms (Fig. 3). Note that because doubling of expected dosage
should result in doubling of the observed dosage, the slope of
these lines should be one. We refer to the observed slopes as
ampliﬁcation dosage sensitivity. This dosage sensitivity greatly
varied between platforms, although the best performing platforms
achieved less than three-quarters the desired slope of one. Note that
this discrepancy between true and measured dosage is common in
microarrays and is explained by the Langmuir adsorption model
as applied to probe saturation (Hekstra et (11., 2003). Measuring a

ranges of NimbleGen 2.1M, NimbleGen 3x720K and Agilent 1M
all overlapped one another at most observation values (Fig. 3 and
Table 3). These three substantially outperformed the other platforms
with Illumina 1M Duo performing worst.

We also assessed sensitivity with respect to deletions. For this
we simply compared the pre-wave-corrected M -values for regions
expected to have copy number 2 to regions with known deletions and
therefore copy number 1 (Fig. 4). We refer to the difference in the
median of these two sets of values as the indel sensitivity. Here the
Illumina platform also underperformed. All other platforms showed
similar results with NimbleGen slightly outperforming.

Fig. 3. Dosage sensitivity plot comparing microarray intensity to nominal
copy number determined by sequence. For each platform we computed the
wave-corrected, average log-ratio (M -Values) within each spiked-in region.
For these same regions we obtained reads per base from sequence data
reﬂecting the relative representation of each spike-in component. Here we
plot the microarray dosage estimates against the log (base 2), genomic DNA
corrected, sequence dosage estimates. Data from all eight arrays are shown.
Each color represents a region present at varying concentration on different

dosage sensitivity in spiked-in regions ranged greatly across and
within platforms, we did not see a correlation between them.

3.4 Precision

We obtained our ﬁrst measure of precision comparing the prewave-
corrected M-values between technical replicates. As each sample
was hybridized in replicate on each platform, we had two vectors of

M -values for each sample that, in principle, should be the same. The
SD of these differences serves as a measure of speciﬁcity that can
be interpreted as the typical copy number percentage change in two
arrays when none should be seen. We refer to this summary as the
replicate variability. All platforms were comparable in this measure
(Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table 3) although Illumina 1M Duo
slightly outperformed the others. We obtained the second measure of
precision by considering the variability among regions with known
copy number 2. Although the vast majority of the non-spiked-in
regions without previously reported deletions were expected to have
copy number 2, we needed to allow for the possibility of some
unknown CNVs being present. We therefore used an estimate of SD
of the measurements in these regions that was robust to outliers: the
median absolute deviation (MAD). We refer to this summary as the
null region variability. This measure was interpreted as the observed
percent change in dosage when none is expected. All platforms were
comparable in this measure as well, although only after removing
the wave effects (Supplementary Fig. 3a compared to Fig. 3b before
removing wave effects and Table 3).

3.5 CNV detection sensitivity and speciﬁcity

The results presented above relate to general characteristics
of the feature-level data. We also studied the downstream
results based on the CNV detection algorithms provided by
the vendors. For each platform, we used company-recommended
software with recommended parameters to generate a list of CNV
calls. Commercially available software support generally provides
ﬂexibility to users for the purpose of generating alternative results
lists. We used reasonable recommended parameters for CNV
detection under conditions where both software operators and
companies were blind to spike-in positions, event sizes and dosages.
No attempt was made to optimize detection of our BAC spike-in
locations. Each vendor reviewed the software parameters that we
used, and a list of regions predicted to be CNV along with the
reported dosage estimates. With the exception of Affymetrix 6.0,
each vendor’s software attached a level of statistical signiﬁcance to
each reported region. For each level of statistical signiﬁcance we
selected the regions above that level and counted the number of
spiked-in regions that overlapped them. This number was denoted
as TPs. Any amount of overlap sufﬁced to qualify as a TP but 75%
of regions had >50% agreement. In Section 3.5 we evaluate the
resolution of these overlaps. We also recorded the sum of lengths
of all non-spiked-in regions detected at each conﬁdence level and
denoted this as coverage. To avoid penalizing technologies ﬁnding
real CNVs not associated with our spike-in experiment, we discarded

data obtained from the company default algorithms as well as our alternative
approach: removing waves and applying CBS in the case of ampliﬁcations,
and in the case of deletions applying CBS without wave correction. We did
this analysis for ampliﬁcations and deletions separately and then obtained
a single curve (solid line) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (dashed lines) by
applying a binomial test upon detected TPs (explained further in Methods
in Supplementary Material). The plots are from (a) company algorithms for

regions found in the Database of Genomic Variants (Iafrate et (11.,
2004). Regions cataloged in this database are likely TPs and should
therefore not be counted as false positives. We also performed an
alternative analysis in which we left out regions that do not have
probes in at least two array platforms. Undocumented real CNVs
in these regions could be especially unfairly detrimental to the
one platform having probes within such regions. That one platform
would be singly penalized for reporting a real CNV since it would
be counted as a false positive and no other platform would have the
opportunity to encounter it.

We plotted TP versus coverage for each platform preferring
algorithms that achieved high TP counts without spending coverage.
We analyzed ampliﬁcations (Supplementary Fig. S4) and deletions
(Supplementary Fig. S5) separately. These results, which used

company-recommended analyses, demonstrate that Illumina 1M
Duo is the clear leader.

In comparing platforms using company-recommended guidelines,
reasonable parameters used in analysis on the various platforms were
quite different from one another. Thus, software attributes and array
performance were seriously confounded, and a direct comparison of
array performance was still needed. Moreover, we wanted to know
how platforms compared using data where measurement artifacts
from waves had been removed. For this reason, and for the purpose
of controlling other pre-processing steps with demonstrated room
for improvement (Dunning et (11., 2008), we created an alternative
data analysis pipeline. For ampliﬁcation detection, our pipeline
applied CBS to the wave-removed M-value data and for deletion
detection our pipeline applied CBS to pre-wave-corrected M -data
as the deletion regions were larger than the ampliﬁcation regions
and wave removal was not necessary for detection. As before, we
plotted TP versus coverage for each platform for ampliﬁcations
(Supplementary Fig. S6) and deletions (Supplementary Fig. S7)
separately. To examine the range of performance, we applied a
binomial test to combined curves from all arrays and provided an
estimated curve along with point-wise conﬁdence intervals, again
separating out ampliﬁcations (Fig. 5a and b, and Table 4) and

deletions (Fig. 5c and d, and Table 5). The results of this pipeline
outperformed the results of our second alternative analysis, in which
we discarded regions not having probes in at least two platforms
(Supplementary Figs S8 and S9), and which appeared similar
to the company-recommended analysis. This may be attributed
to the fact that many more hundreds of megabases of genomic
space were discarded when accounting for documented CNVs
than when accounting for regions not covered by at least two
platforms. Overall, performance was greatly improved with use
of our alternative data analysis pipeline. Speciﬁcally, the use of
this analytical approach substantially improved the performance of
Agilent 1M, NimbleGen 2.1M, NimbleGen 3x720K, Affymetrix
6.0 and Affymetrix 2.7M. Under these conditions, performance
was comparable across platforms with NimbleGen 2.1M slightly
outperforming the rest and Affymetrix 2.7M performing as well for
deletions (Fig. 5).

3.6 CNV region resolution

The molecular details of probe and sample constitution diverge
substantially across the platforms we compare. A common
assumption is that ‘per probe’ performance is similar on different

platforms, and that a larger probe number should provide CNV
deﬁnition of increased resolution. We tested this assumption across
platforms. For the spiked-in regions that were detected, we compared
the true start and end of each BAC to the CNV start and end
estimates provided by the vendor-recommended algorithms. We
calculated the distance between true and estimated positions, and
summarized these in a boxplot (Supplementary Fig. S10). The higher
resolution arrays, NimbleGen 2.1M and Affymetrix 2.7M, clearly
outperformed Illumina 1M Duo, NimbleGen 3x720K, Agilent 1M
and Affymetrix 6.0 in this measure. Moreover, we examined non-
spiked-in regions that were detected by more than one platform,
and we noticed dozens of regions that were detected by NimbleGen
2.1M and just one other array platform, with Affymetrix 6.0 being
the second platform most often, but closely followed by Agilent 1M
and NimbleGen 3x720K. Close inspection revealed that the lower
resolution of the other platforms allowed fewer, and sometimes zero,
points in these regions (Fig. 6). As they were detected by multiple
platforms and across replicates we believe that these are real CNVs.
These two observations strongly support the common assumption
of greater resolution from denser coverage, even across platforms.

4 DISCUSSION

We have performed a thorough comparison of six CNV detection
platforms: Agilent 1M, NimbleGen 2.1M, NimbleGen 3x720K,
Illumina 1M Duo, Affymetrix 6.0, and Affymetrix 2.7M. We
used a carefully designed spike-in experiment to facilitate the
data analysis. We found that removal of strong wave artifacts
greatly improved analysis, in particular for Agilent 1M, NimbleGen
2.1M, and Affymetrix 2.7M arrays. Precision from replicates was
similar across all platforms. Greater probe density does result in
higher breakpoint resolution among platforms tested here, even

though diverse technologies are used for sample labeling and signal
detection.

Our analysis demonstrated that, when using company-
recommended software, the Illumina 1M Duo and Affymetrix 6.0
platforms performed well at detecting CNVs while not performing
well in dosage sensitivity. This presented an apparent paradox.
It is explained by the use of the BAF measure, which is quite
sensitive to copy number changes in cases where the dosage-related
measures perform poorly (e.g. Fig. 1). We found various examples
where dosage measures do not detect CNVs but BAF measures
do (Supplementary Fig. S11 includes four examples). However,
the use of SNP allele frequency to detect copy number alterations
introduces two obstacles to CNV analysis. First, the accuracy of
dosage estimates is below that of the CGH arrays from NimbleGen
and Agilent. Secondly, the density of naturally occurring SNPs limits
genotyping array density. This, in turn, hinders the detection ability
of Illumina 1M Duo and Affymetrix 6.0 for small CNVs (less than
~50—100 kb) which arrays of high density, and NimbleGen 2.1M in
particular, are able to detect.

After consideration of dosage sensitivity, precision, speciﬁcity,
sensitivity and CNV border deﬁnition, the NimbleGen 2.1M
platform demonstrated the best overall performance. However,
careful removal of the wave artifact is a necessity. For researchers
who depend on current company-recommended analysis algorithms,
the Illumina 1M Duo platform performed best as it is able to detect
CNVs with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity if they are >100 kb.
However, in addition to its insensitivity to small CNVs, this platform
underperforms at estimation of dosage and CNV start/end location.

We expect new high-throughput CNV detection platforms to
emerge and new technologies, such as analysis of second generation
sequence data, to become practical in the near future. Our study
design and statistical analysis strategies are not speciﬁc to the
platforms addressed here, and this approach can be readily applied
to incorporate comparisons of newer technologies as they enter the
research and clinical marketplace. Technical assessments comparing
extant and emergent methods can support informed platform choice
for a given research or clinical purpose, provide context for cross-
platform results comparison where needed, and sharpen focus on the
relative technical limitations and strengths that drive improvements
in competing technologies.

Abstract

Summary: DNA methylation is an important mechanism regulating gene transcription, and its
role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. Hyper and hypomethylation of genes is an
alternative mechanism to deregulate gene expression in a wide range of diseases. At the same
time, high—throughput DNA methylation assays have been developed generating vast amounts of
genome wide DNA methylation measurements. Yet, few tools exist that can formally identify hypo
and hypermethylated genes that are predictive of transcription and thus functionally relevant for
a particular disease. To accommodate this lack of tools, we developed MethylMix, an algorithm
implemented in R to identify disease specific hyper and hypomethylated genes. MethylMix is
based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal
DNA methylation state. MethylMix introduces a novel metric, the ’Differential Methylation value’ or
DM—value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state.
Finally, matched gene expression data are used to identify, besides differential, transcriptionally
predictive methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene expression.

Availability and implementation: MethylMix was implemented as an R package and is available

in bioconductor.

1 Introduction

DNA methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic aberrations
underlying oncogenesis. Besides genetic mutations, hyper and hypo-
methylation of genes is an alternative mechanism that is capable of
altering the normal state and driving a wide range of diseases. Prior
studies have identified hypo or hypermethylation based on heuristic
measures for example in breast cancer (Hill et (11., 2011).
Additionally, computational methods have been developed to iden-
tify differentially methylated regions for specific DNA methylation
platforms (Aryee et (11., 2014; Wang et 31., 2012; Warden et 31.,
2013). However, few methods formalize the identification of DNA
methylation driven genes using a model-based approach. We identi-
fied three key criteria that should he addressed to derive key methy-
lation-driven genes. First, the determination of the degree of
methylation cannot hinge on arhitrary thresholds as is commonly
done. Second, the assessment of a gene as hyper or hypomethylated
must he made in comparison to normal tissue. Finally, the

transcriptionally predictive effect, therehy implying that their
methylation is functionally relevant. We designed MethylMix to ac-
commodate these three criteria to identify methylation driven genes
in diseases.

2 Algorithm

MethylMix integrates DNA methylation from normal and disease
samples and matched disease gene expression data via a three-step
algorithm:

° Step i: Genes are ﬁltered by identifying transcriptionally predict-
ive methylation. First, each CpG site is associated with its closest
gene. Next, MethylMix requires that the DNA methylation of a
CpG site has a significant effect on its corresponding gene expres-
sion in order for the gene to he considered a methylation-driven
gene. We deﬁne such genes as transcriptionally predictive genes.

cohort to identify methylation states and capture DNA methylation
heterogeneity present in a particular disease. We used MethylMix
and their associated DM—values to identify driver genes (Gevaert
and Plevritis, 2013; Gevaert et al., 2013, 2014), on dataset sizes of
100 samples ore more, and on more than 4000 TCGA cases across
12 tissues to identify methylation driven subgroups (Gevaert et al.,
2015). In summary, MethylMix offers a new tool to identify methy—
lation—driven genes providing a complimentary source of informa—
tion to copy number and mutation spectra to identify disease driver
genes.

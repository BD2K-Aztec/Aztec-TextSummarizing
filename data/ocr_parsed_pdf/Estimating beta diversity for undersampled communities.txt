Abstract

Motivation: In profiling the composition and structure of complex microbial communities via high
throughput amplicon sequencing, a very low proportion of community members are typically
sampled. As a result of this incomplete sampling, estimates of dissimilarity between communities
are often inflated, an issue we term pseudo B—diversity.

Results: We present a set of tools to identify and correct for the presence of pseudo B—diversity in
contrasts between microbial communities. The variably weighted Odum dissimilarity (Dwodum)
allows for down—weighting the influence of either abundant or rare taxa in calculating a measure of
similarity between two communities. We show that down—weighting the influence of rare taxa can
be used to minimize pseudo B—diversity arising from incomplete sampling. Down—weighting the
influence of abundant taxa can increase the sensitivity of hypothesis testing. OTUshuff is an associ—
ated test for identifying the presence of pseudo B—diversity in pairwise community contrasts.
Availability and implementation: A Perl script for calculating the Dwodum score from a taxon abun—
dance table and performing pairwise contrasts with OTUshuff can be obtained at http://www.ars.

1 Introduction

The size and diversity of microbial populations pose challenges to
characterizing and contrasting communities. For instance, sequence-
based analyses of bacterial populations in soil frequently suggest the
presence of more than 106—109 individuals distributed across thou-
sands of distinct taxa per grant of soil (Deng et (11., 2012; Kuffner
et (11., 2012). Although the advent of high-throughput sequencing
technologies has increased the depth at which we are able to survey
microbial community composition, in many cases sampling still de-
tects only a fraction of the diversity present at a given site. For in-
stance, working with rhizosphere soil samples from a grass host
plant species, Lagos et a1. (2014) obtained 30 000—60 000 sequence
reads per sample, yet estimated that they were able to detect only

90% of the OTUs that could have been observed at greater sampling
depth. Taxa that are present at low abundance may nevertheless be
important to understanding community dynamics. For instance,
Shade et al. (2014) have demonstrated from analyses of time series
in several different environments that many taxa are only condition-
ally rare, and may be present at dramatically higher abundances at
other time points.

While there is debate over the relative benefits of increasing sam-
pling depth versus increasing the number of samples analyzed
(Kuczynski et (11., 2010) it is becoming increasingly common to trade
sample depth for more extensive replication. For instance, in a
recent characterization of the Arabidopsis-associated microbiome,
researchers analyzed 1248 samples at 1000 sequence reads per

sample (Lundberg et 41., 2012). These developments highlight the
need for analytical approaches that are specifically designed to ac—
count for effects attributable to shallow sampling. It should be noted
that incomplete sampling will be a more pressing issue for environ—
ments that harbor the most diverse microbial communities, such
as soil.

Beyond simply creating a census of which bacterial taxa are pre—
sent in a given environment, researchers frequently desire to com—
pare two or more species assemblages for differences in species
composition and structure. A large number of indices are available
for such purposes [summarized in (Magurran, 2004)], but many of
these were developed in systems for which it is possible to be nearly
comprehensive in detecting species that are present in a given loca—
tion (i.e. plant and animal communities). In contrast, the majority of
species are likely to go undetected in shallow sequence—based surveys
of complex microbial communities.

Indices for describing the resemblance between communities are
often based either on species composition (i.e. presence—absence
measures) or on community structure (i.e. taking into consideration
the relative abundance of species within each community). Both
index types are sensitive to incomplete sampling (Chao et al., 2005).

When dealing with complex microbial communities, the infla—
tion of dissimilarity due to incomplete sampling is a concern; differ—
ential detection of low abundance taxa may be simply due to
insufficient sampling, and not to true absence from the community
(Chao et al., 2005 ). Furthermore, rare sequence variants may not al—
ways reflect true taxon presence or abundance; rather, they may be
introduced through errors in DNA replication or sequencing
(Quince et al., 2011). Thus, the ability to adjust the influence of low
abundance taxa on a measure of community resemblance is
desirable.

Indices that give less weight to low abundance community mem—
bers exist within the current suite of community resemblance metrics
(Magurran, 2004). For instance, Beck et al. (2013) compared 14 dif—
ferent measures of B—diversity and concluded that measures with
high dependency on the distribution of abundant taxa were the least
sensitive to under—sampling (e.g. Morisita—Horn). However, differ—
ences among microbial communities, or microbial community re—
sponse to experimental manipulation, may lie in changes in taxon
abundance anywhere across the distribution from dominant to rare
community members. Thus, a measure of dissimilarity should
ideally be tunable in its sensitivity toward rare or dominant
members.

Among non—phylogenetic measures of community resemblance,
the only method that we are aware of that is tunable in sensitivity to
rare taxa is the Normalized Expected Species Shared method of
Grassle and Smith (1976). However, this method adjusts the influ—
ence of rare taxa by re—sampling an observed taxon abundance table
at varying depths. Thus, this method relies upon the very problem
we are trying to address (incomplete sampling), and leaves room for
improvement. A variably weighted version of the phylogenetic dis—
tance measure UniFrac has been proposed (Chen et al., 2012), and
will be discussed below. Recent parallel developments in the field of
community diversity assessment have come to similar conclusions
regarding the utility of calculating diversity indices across a range of
sensitivities toward low abundance community members (Leinster
and Cobbold, 2012).

A number of statistical tests are available to assess the signifi—
cance of differences in microbial community structure, including
UniFrac, Parsimony, AMOVA and HOMOVA. Schloss (2008) has
provided a comparison of these methods, and suggests that each car—
ries distinct benefits. However, the effects of incomplete sampling

have not been well explored for statistical tests that contrast micro—
bial community structure. Here, we present a new analytical method
to contrast two samples, which indicates the likelihood that the
observed samples were drawn from a common community. We illus—
trate the method using simulated data, as well as bacterial sequence
data (partial 16S rRNA gene fragments) derived from 51 soil sam—
ples, collected across a range of geographic locations, plant com—
munities and land uses.

2 Methods

2.1 The variably weighted Odum dissimilarity index

The particular characteristics of sequence—based profiling of micro—
bial communities demand an appropriate index of community re—
semblance. We use as our starting point the traditional Odum index
(Odum, 1950):

S
ZlAi—Bil
i1

(Ai +31)

1 l
H

DOdum :

My,

' 1

where A and B are the samples being compared, and S is the total
number of observed taxa. When the original taxon counts have been
converted into proportions (as we will assume throughout), the Odum
index is mathematically equivalent (Somerfield, 2008) to the com—
monly used Bray—Curtis dissimilarity index (Bray and Curtis, 1957):

S
E 2. 11’1111(A,'7 

DBC : 1 — —‘:1 S (2)

ZM,‘ + Bi)
i:1
The proper naming and origins of these formulas are a topic of

some debate (Somerfield, 2008; Yoshioka, 2008); however, we use
the terms Odum index (Eq. 1) and Bray—Curtis dissimilarity (Eq. 2)
to differentiate the two notations. Regardless of the notation, with
this metric, differences in the abundance of common or rare taxa are
given equal weighting. As a modification that allows adjustable in—
fluence based on taxon rarity, we propose a variably weighted ver—
sion of the Odum index, which we call deum:

where A and B are the samples being compared, S is the total number
of observed taxa and or is a weighting parameter, such that 012 0.
DWOdum is bounded between 0 and 1, where a score of 0 would re—
flect the contrast of a community to itself (all taxa shared, and at the
same relative abundances in both communities) and a score of 1
would reflect completely dissimilar communities (no taxa shared be—
tween communities). When er: 1, Ddeum is reduced to Equation
(1) above and DWOdum is equal to DC)de or DEC; when or < 1, the in—
fluence of abundant taxa will be down—weighted; and when or> 1,
the influence of low abundance taxa will be down—weighted. Figure
1 depicts a simple simulation in order to illustrate the effect of the
weighting parameter on Ddeum scores.

In this example, we started with two samples having the follow—
ing taxon abundance distributions (Community A: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1]; Community B: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]). In order to

sequence reads) at a given location along the gradient were assigned to
taxa probabilistically, leading to differences in observed communities
among locations (Fig. 3B). With this approach, diversity and evenness
will be lower at the extremes, compared to the center of the gradient.
The phylogenetic distances required for DGUniFm were modeled in a
manner similar to that of Schloss (2008). Brieﬂy, distances between
OTUs within a community were randomly generated from a two—di—
mensional circle (1’: 0.1) and each community centroid was offset by
0.1 (e.g. community 1: 0; community 2: 0.1; community 3: 0.2; etc.).

From these defined communities, we simulated true B—diversity
(that is, measured distance or dissimilarity between two fully—sampled
communities). It should be noted that true B—diversity can only be
known in the context of simulated communities for which compos—
ition is determined a priori and for which the taxon abundance distri—
butions are defined. We selected 15 locations along the environmental
gradient (1—10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100), and at each location allowed
the abundance of each OTU to vary randomly by:0—100%. This
process was repeated five times to generate a set of replicate samples
at each location, and then the full simulation was repeated 100 times.
Complete sampling was assumed to occur at 109 individuals per sam—
ple, or the point where each OTU present along the hypothetical en—
vironmental gradient was detected at least once.

To simulate pseudo B—diversity (that is, the portion of a pairwise
distance or dissimilarity that is attributable purely to having an in—
complete census of the two communities in question), a set number
of observations could be drawn probabilistically to generate com—
munity surveys with incomplete sampling.

2.4 Observed data

Soils were collected from 11 different sites representing a wide range
of geographic locations, plant communities and land uses (Table 1)
within the United States. Within each site, a single soil sample
(0—7.5 cm depth) was collected from each plot (11 : 3—4) unless speci—
fied differently. For each of the three Alaska sites (AK.1, AK.2, AK.3),
plots were centered on a single white spruce tree with each tree
located a minimum of 1 km apart. The CA.1 site is a commercial po—
tato farm located in Tulelake, California and was sampled

crobial communities were characterized by sequencing

immediately prior to harvest. The CO.1 site was part of cover crop
study located in the San Luis Valley, Colorado (Essah et al., 2012).
Plots were sampled at the end of a cover crop rotation (i.e. mowing
and incorporation). The remaining three Colorado sites (C02, C03,
CO.4) are all part of the Dryland Agroecosystems Project (Sherrod
et 41., 2014) with each plot (11:4) consisting of a single soil sample
from a randomly selected plot under wheat management. The sites
MA.1 and MA.2 are golf courses located in Massachusetts, where
each plot consists of a fairway and rough sample from three different
holes per course. The NE site consists of a switchgrass cultivar trial at
the University of Nebraska’s Agricultural Research and Development
Center with each plot consisting of twelve switchgrass plants of the
same cultivar. From each plot (11:3) rhizosphere soil (0 to 15 cm)
was collected from a single plant.

2.5 DNA extraction and PCR amplification

DNA was extracted from 0.5 g subsamples of each soil collection
using the MoBio UltraClean—HTPIM soil DNA isolation kit
(Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommenda—
tions plus an additional purification step with AMPure beads
(Agencourt, MA, USA) to further remove humic acids and other
PCR inhibitors. Extracted DNA was quantified by spectrophotom—
etry and diluted to a final concentration of 10 ng ul'I. Amplification
of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments was performed as described
by Manter et al. (2010), using primers 27F and 388R to amplify
across the V1—V3 hypervariable regions of the gene. Primers were
modified to add a unique barcode (Hamady et al., 2008) to ampli—
cons from each of 51 distinct samples (Table 1). Unidirectional (Lib—
L) pyrosequencing was performed under contract with Duke
University’s IGSP Sequencing Core Facility using a 454 Life Sciences
GS FLX System with standard chemistry.

2.6 Sequence processing

All sequence read editing and processing was performed with Mothur
Ver. 1.32 (Schloss et al., 2009) using the default settings unless
otherwise noted. Briefly, sequence reads were (i) trimmed (bdiff: 0,
pdiff : 0, qaverage : 25, minlength : 100, maxambig : 0,
maxhomop : 10); (ii) aligned to the bacterial—subset SILVA alignment
available at the Mothur website (http://www.mothur.org); (iii) filtered
to remove vertical gaps; (iv) screened for chimeras with UCHIME
(Edgar et 41., 2011); (v) classified using the RDP training set Vers. 9
(http://www.mothur.org) and the naive Baysian classifier (Wang et 41.,
2007) embedded in Mothur, after which all sequences identified as
chloroplast or mitochondria were removed; (vi) sequences were
screened (optimize : minlength—end, criteria : 95) and filtered
(vertical: T, trump:.) so that all sequences covered the same genetic
space; and (vii) all sequences were pre—clustered (diff:2) to remove
potential pyrosequencing noise and clustered (calc : onegap, cou—
tends : F, method : average) into operational taxonomic units or
OTUs (Huse et 41., 2010). After processing, each site— or plot—specific
library was randomly split into subsamples of 1000 sequence reads in
order to standardize sampling effort for each sample, and to generate
replicate subsamples from within a given library for comparison.
Differences between replicate subsamples from the same dataset repre—
sent sensitivity to low sample coverage, and should be minimized. If a
method is truly suitable for severely under—sampled communities, a
comparative analysis should not detect a statistical difference between
subsamples from the same library.

at reducing pseudo B—diversity because of limitations to the range of
or. Extending or above 1 in an effort to reduce the potential effects of
pseudo B—diversity on DGUniFm scores resulted in distances for all
comparisons (sites, plots within sites and subsamples) approaching
zero (Supplementary Fig. S9). In other words, site differences were
not preserved with DGUniFm as or was increased.

Existing indices varied widely in their ability to differentiate
soil bacterial communities from different sites and to avoid
pseudo B—diversity associated with incomplete sampling. For
instance, DCanberrzl between subsamples drawn from a common
pool was low, but this index was also unable to detect appreciable
difference between sites (Supplementary Fig. 510). In contrast,
Dsoergel between communities from different sites was high, but
this index was also prone to over—estimating B—diversity between
subsamples drawn from a common pool (Supplementary
Fig. 510).

4 Discussion

Ecologists have a well—developed set of techniques for comparing
the composition and structure of communities. However, exten—
sion of these approaches into new systems and the implementation
of new techniques for surveying community membership may re—
quire new approaches and on—going refinement of traditional
methods. In particular, the widespread adoption of DNA se—
quence—based methods of characterizing microbial communities in
complex environments such as soil has created unique analytical
challenges.

Comprehensive surveys of microbial inhabitants are often un—
feasible, and limited resources require balancing a trade—off between
depth of characterization and breadth of sampling. It has become
quite common for microbial ecologists to sample communities to a
very shallow depth, where the number of observations is lower than
the number of taxa that are present (Roesch et al., 2007; Eiler et al.,
2012; Lundberg et al., 2012); as a result, estimates of distance or
dissimilarity between samples tend to be very large, and may arise
from either true or pseudo B—diversity depending upon the true
underlying similarity (e.g. Fig. 7).

Currently, there are no statistical tools available to evaluate the
potential for pseudo B—diversity to inflate estimates of community
distance or dissimilarity. Our procedure for pairwise contrasts,
OTUshuff, is insensitive to pseudo B—diversity, correctly identifying
all subsamples drawn from the same community as not significantly
different. Therefore, OTUshuff is a useful tool to identify if scores
are likely to be associated with pseudo B—diversity and whether reli—
able estimates of B—diversity may require additional sampling, or an
alternative index. For instance, in lieu of additional sampling, we
show that Ddeum with 0121 is a suitable approach to remove
pseudo B—diversity and provide more accurate estimates of commu—
nity dissimilarity (Table 2; Fig. 7).

When samples are drawn from genuinely different communities,
OTUshuff consistently shows significant differences. In these mean—
ingful contrasts, as we discuss above, varying the choice of commu—
nity resemblance index, or Ddeum or level, may increase the
sensitivity to detect differences. Although a wide array of indices
and tests are available, each has its own inherent limitations
(Magurran, 2004; Schloss, 2008). While users could pick and choose
among existing indices, we have shown that these measures can be
sensitive to incomplete sampling, often in unpredictable ways. We
also suggest that it is preferable to be able to adjust weightings
within the context of a consistent index, rather than switching defin—
itions of community resemblance in order to achieve the desired

weightings. The tunable nature of the Ddeum and DGUniFm scores
offers maximum selectivity and sensitivity. For example, Ddeum
and DGUniFm were the only two scores that could consistently detect
a significant difference (AMOVA, P < 0.05) between location 1 and
2 in our simulated environmental gradient, and this was achieved by
increasing the influence of rare taxa (or : 0).

We have highlighted at several points that the variable weight—
ing of Ddeum mirrors the capabilities of the phylogenetic distance
measure DGUniFm. However, there are substantial differences be—
tween these methods. Primarily, DGUniFm is a phylogenetic dis—
tance, which requires the ability to place observed taxa onto a
phylogenetic tree so that branch lengths can be used in calculating
distances. However, there are applications for which it may not be
possible to determine a reliable phylogenetic tree, particularly
when using highly variable DNA sequences such as internal tran—
scribed spacer (ITS) data. The weighting parameter for DGUniFm,
as originally described, was limited to or 6 [0,1]. We report
DGUniFm scores at or > 1 for purposes of comparison with Ddeum,
but with our biological data DGUniFm became insensitive to be—
tween plot and between site B—diversity at these higher levels of or
(Supplementary Fig. S9). Thus, Ddeum may be preferable for
more severe down—weighting of low abundance taxa. When com—
paring Ddeum and DGUniFm scores, two patterns become appar—
ent (i) DGUniFm variability is not affected as strongly as Ddeum
by or level, and (ii) DGUniFm is prone to large deviations in result—
ant scores depending upon the number of sequence reads employed
(e.g. Supplementary Fig. 58—5000 reads). We suggest that this is
due to the additional branch—length weighting in DGUniFrac, and de—
pending upon the sampling intensity and the user’s interests, such
weighting may not be desired.

In setting or for contrasting observed microbial communities,
users should consider both the coverage of their sampling (i.e. the
proportion of the estimated total number of taxa present that
were actually observed) and the expected degree of similarity
among the communities that are being contrasted. Lower coverage
indicates that many low abundance taxa may have been differen—
tially detected simply due to incomplete sampling, and therefore
that the influence of low abundance taxa should be down—
weighted in calculating community dissimilarity. If the commun—
ities being contrasted are expected to be highly similar (for in—
stance, samples drawn from the same individual host, samples
collected under stringently controlled environmental conditions,
or samples collected at frequent intervals over a time series), than
the low abundance taxa may be critical to measuring community
resemblance, and their influence on the dissimilarity score may be
increased. As with any framework for simulating datasets, our ap—
proach to simulating microbial communities has limitations. For
instance, simulated communities found along our hypothetical en—
vironmental gradient followed a normal distribution in the decline
of abundance with distance from their optimum. This is a sim—
plifying assumption. We did not attempt to contrast communities
influenced simultaneously by more than one ecological gradient,
or differing in underlying population structures (e.g. abundance
distributions, evenness, or richness). As for any new metric, add—
itional testing under various simulation strategies is warranted to
better understand its controlling factors.

In conclusion, the new analytical tools introduced here will fa—
cilitate progress in understanding the forces that structure complex
microbial communities. Ddeum is a dissimilarity index for which
the influence of low abundance taxa is tunable. OTUshuff is a new
statistical test to determine whether two samples are drawn from
genuinely different communities.

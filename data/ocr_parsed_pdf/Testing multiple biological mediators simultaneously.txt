Testing multiple mediators

 

2 METHODS

2.1 Testing a single association

For testing a single association, we assume that there are two normally
distributed variables, X and Y, related by Equation (1)

Y=K0+bX+€ (l)

where 6 ~ N(0, :72). The null hypothesis can be stated as either H0 : b = 0
or H0 : pX~ y = 0, where pX~ y is the correlation between X and Y.
Although less common, the latter framework facilitates comparisons
with testing mediators. The null hypothesis can be tested by:

Test 0:. We declare X to be signiﬁcantly associated with Y if p], 5 0.05
(or lﬁ(X, Y)| 2 n).

where f)(X, Y), is the sample correlation coefﬁcient, 17;, is the P-value and
t1 is the 95th percentile for the null distribution of |[)(X, Y)|. Both 17;, and
t1 can be calculated by asymptotic theory or permutation. For the latter,
we can permute values of Y to obtain JT( Y), where JT(-) indicates a per-
mutation of an original variable, and calculate |[)(X, 71(Y))| for each
permuted dataset. Then, 17;, is the proportion of permuted values greater
than or equal to the observed value and t, is the 95th percentile of the
permuted values. The tests discussed in this article are summarized in
Table 1.

2.2 Testing multiple associations

When we test the association between Y and multiple variables,
X1,...,XK, we calculate |[)(X,», Y)| and its corresponding P-values, 17],,
for ie {1, ...,K}. To maintain a FWER of 0.05, we have two options.
First, we can estimate the threshold by Bonferroni correction, where ti, is
the 100 X (1 — 0.05/K)th percentile of the null distribution estimated for
|ﬁ(X,», Y)| and consider the test:

Test 0B: We declare X,- to be signiﬁcantly associated with Y if
méowmwmmnnmai

For the permutation estimates of ti, to converge to their true quantiles,
we depend on the inherent assumption in Equation (1), that the full joint
distribution of X is determined by the marginal distributions, or that the
joint distribution of X is constant for all Y under the null hypothesis
(Huang et al., 2006). Similar assumptions are required for tests described
here and elsewhere.

The second option, which uses the max correction (Westfall and
Young, 1993), is to estimate the 95th percentile of the distribution
of ﬁmx E max,»(|[)(X,», JT( Y))|) by permuting Y. Here, we use the
term ‘joint correction’ because the distribution of the maximal test stat-
istic depends on the joint distribution of the multiple variables. We let t,

Note that we only permute Y once for each dataset, as opposed to once
for each X,- for Test 0].

2.3 Testing a single mediator

For testing a single mediator, we start by assuming that the exposure,
putative mediator and outcome are normally distributed and related by
Equations (2) and (3). The directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Figure 1
illustrates this relationship.

M 2 KM + otE + EM, (2)

Y=Ky+yE+ﬁM+6y, (3)

where E ~ N(0, Eric), 6M ~ N(0, 0%)) and 6y ~ N(0, 0%,). Therefore, Y can
also be described by

Y:K’§,+y*E+e’; (4)

where 6’; ~ N(0, a? + 201%) + (y + aﬁfaé). We can describe two general
approaches for testing if M is a mediator (MacKinnon et al., 2002; Sobel,
1982). We can either evaluate whether both at 7A 0 and )3 7A 0 or whether
their product 01/3 75 0. For interpretation, we note that 01/3 E y* — y, which
is the difference between the total and direct effect of E. To facilitate
comparison across metabolites, with concentrations that vary by orders
by magnitude, we prefer normalized versions of oz and )3. Therefore, we
replace at and )3 by pEM and pMy‘E, respectively, where pEM is the correl-
ation between E and M and pMy‘E is the conditional correlation between
M and Y. The sample correlation coefﬁcients, i)(E,]l/[) and ﬁ(rME,rY‘E),
offer estimates of these parameters. Here, rm: and rM‘E, are the residuals
from regressing Y on E and M on E, respectively.
The ﬁrst test we consider is as follows:

Test 1:. We declare M to be signiﬁcant if pa 5 0.05 and pg 5 0.05 (or
WEJ/Ol Z t1(0!) and lﬁUMiEaFYiEN Z [103»,

where pa is the corresponding P-value and t1(ot) is the 95th percentile for
the null distribution of |[)(E, A/I)|. pg and t1(ﬁ) are deﬁned similarly for
| {3(er E, r y‘ E)|. All values can be calculated by asymptotic theory or per-
mutation. An overall P-value for Test 1 can be deﬁned as max(pa,pﬁ).
The exact steps are presented in Algorithms 1 (for at) and 2 (for )3).
Freedman and Lane (Freedman and Lane, 1983) offer the rationale for
Algorithm 2, even though, like all permutation tests for a conditional
association, it is not exact (Anderson and Robinson, 2001).

(3) Repeat steps 1 and 2 to obtain a distribution of |[)(JI(E), A/I)|. pa is

95th percentile of the distribution.

The second test uses the statistic S = |[)(E, MAIN, E, r y, E)|:
Test 2:. We declare M to be signiﬁcant ifpS 5 0.05 (or S : t1(S)),

where pS and t1(S) have their usual meaning. The exact steps are pre-
sented in Algorithm 3, which is described so that it can be adapted for
testing multiple mediators. Otherwise, we would have performed two sets
of permutations and let t1 (S) be the maximum of two thresholds, the 95th
percentile for the distribution of |p(n(E),]l/[);3(ry,E,rM,E)| and the 95th
percentile for |ﬁ(E,]l/[)i)(rM,E,r’;,E)|. In this format, Tests 1 and 2 would
be equivalent. To obtain t1 (S), we could perform Algorithms 1 and 2 and
then let [1(5) 2 t1(ﬁ)ﬁ(E,M) if li’(EaMI Z l/3("MjE,ri/jE)| and
t1(5) = [1(a)/3(rM\EarY\E) if IKE, Ml < l/3("MiE, I‘yiEN- However, we
choose to formally describe the steps for Test 2 by Algorithm 3. In this
form, the algorithm can be easily adapted for multiple mediators. When
considering non-normally distributed variables, Test 2 could, at least in
theory, produce inﬂated type I errors. The test and algorithm described in
Supplementary Section S5 offers a more conservative alternative.

2.4 Testing multiple mediators

For testing multiple mediators, we start by assuming that the exposure,
putative mediators and outcome are normally distributed and related by
Equations (5) and (6). The DAG in Figure 2 illustrates this relationship:

Mi = KM,- + OliE + 5M” (5)

where E ~ N(0,a,25), EM, ~ N(0,a,zw,) and 6y ~ N(0,a§,). Therefore, Y
can also be described by

Y=o+VE+4, (m

K K
where 6’; ~ N(0, 0%, +  [32:52”, + (y +  a,»ﬁ,»)za,2§)

When we test multiple mediators, M1,...,MK, we calculate
i)(E, M ,»), [)(ng E, r y, E) and S,- for each metabolite individually. We can
maintain a FWER across all tests by using Bonferroni corrected
thresholds:

Test 1B:. We declare M,-to be signiﬁcantifpa, 5 0.05/Kandpg, 5 0.05/K

Test 2B:. We declare M ,- to be signiﬁcant if PS; 5 0.05/K (or S,» : ti,(S)).

Here, ti,(ot), $03) and ti,(S) are the 100 X (1 — 0.05/K)th percentiles of
the appropriate null distribution. Again, the quality of the permuted

estimates of ti,(ot), $03) and ti,(S) depends strongly on our assumption
that the joint distribution of Y and M, conditioned on E, is uniquely
determined by the marginal distributions deﬁned in Equations (5) and
(6) (Xu and Hsu, 2007).

We can also maintain a FWER by using a joint correction through
taking the maximal test statistics. First, letting {323,3 2 max,»(|f)(E,M,»)|)
and pm 2 max,»(|f)(rM,,E, ry,E)|), we define test 1]:

Test 1J:. We declare M,- to be signiﬁcant ifpgf‘" 5 0.05 and pig?“ 5 0.05
[Of |t3(E,Mi)| 2 [1(0) and lﬁU‘MnEJ‘YiEN 2 [1(5)],

where l,/(Ol) and t,,(ﬁ) are the 95th percentiles of the null distributions of
{333‘ and {3%}, respectively, and p323" and pig“ compare the values of the
observed statistics for mediator i to these null distributions. Tests 1] and
1B will be nearly identical for independent mediators. The more interest-
ing option is the extension of Test 2, where we deﬁne a single statistic
Sjoim = maXi(Si)5

Test 2J:. We declare M,- to be signiﬁcant ipr, 5 0.05 (or S,» : t,,(S)).

To deﬁne the permutation algorithm for pl, and t,,(S), we consider the
following partition of the possible mediators:

A = {i5 l/3(E,Mi)|< l/3("M,-\EJ‘YiE)|}
B = {i5 |ﬁ(E,Mi)| Z l/3("M,-\EJ‘YiE)|}

We then go through the steps in Algorithm 4.

Mi)i)(ryj£, Fix/MEN-

(2) For i e B, calculate [)(I‘MAEa "ii/us) and S? = | “E M i)/3("M;\E,r’i/j5)|-

(3) Calculate Slim 2 max,»(S:7).

(4) Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 to obtain a distribution of Sim. Calculate
the P-value, p,,,, for each mediator as the proportion of Slim
exceeding S,» and the threshold t,,(S) as the 95th percentile of this
distribution.

 

 

2.5 Beyond normality

Our framework only needs to be slightly modiﬁed for the scenario where
the outcome is not normally distributed. For example, mediation for
binary outcomes can be tested using the same algorithms. We continue
to let r y, E be the residuals after ﬁtting a linear regression with Y as the
dependent variable and let [3(I‘M,‘E,I‘Y‘E) be the sample correlation

coefﬁcients. Then, we will still assume that the DAG in Figure 2 is true,
but we will replace Equation (6) with:

K
Ki'JrVEJrZﬁiMi
l:l
Pr(Y:1|E,M1,...,MK): e

K (8)
Ki'JrVEJrZﬁiMi
1 + e [:1

However, we will need to slightly modify the algorithms in case/control
studies, where the data are collected retrospectively. Thus, for f)(E, M) to
consistently estimate the correlation between E and M in the overall
population, it is necessary to weight each case by U/q and each control
by (1 — U)/(1 — q), where U represents the prevalence of the outcome in
the overall population and q represents the proportion of cases in the
sample, as in VanderWeele and Vansteelandt (2010). We note that for this
analysis to be performed, one must have prior knowledge of U, as this
cannot be estimated from the data.

The distribution of E is taken to be normal only out of convenience,
and the same analysis can be performed for other distributions. In the
case where E is discrete and each possible value is represented multiple
times in the dataset, an exact permutation test exists for testing the con-
ditional associations between the mediators and the outcome, instead of
the FreedmaniLane approximation. (Brown and Maritz, 1982).

2.6 Simulations

We simulate studies where all the variables are normally distributed and
follow Equations (3) and (4) (Fig. 1) for the single mediator case and
Equations (5) and (6) (Fig. 2) for the multiple mediator case. The mar-
ginal variance of all variables was ﬁxed to be 1. We also simulate case-
control studies with a binary outcome Y following Equation (8) and a
population prevalence U : 0.2. The sample size, n, for each study was
either 100 or 1000 individuals. For studies with a binary outcome, n was
equally divided among cases and controls. For each simulated study,
20 000 permutations were performed to obtain the permutation distribu-
tions. All methods were implemented in the R programming language
(R Core Team, 2012).

2.6.] Single mediator We ﬁrst consider the scenario where E, M and
Y are normally distributed. To estimate the type I error rates, we set (at, )3)
to be either (0, 0), (es, 0) or (0, es), where es is the sample size dependent
effect size. As with all simulated studies, we take y : 0. Supplementary
Material shows that letting y 75 0 does not qualitatively affect the results.
We then simulate 10 000 studies and deﬁne the observed type I error rate
to be the fraction of studies where M is declared to be statistically sig-
niﬁcant. To estimate power, we set (at, )3) to (es,es), (0.5es,1.5es) or (1 .5es,
0.5es). We then simulate 1000 studies and deﬁne power to be the fraction
of studies where M is signiﬁcant. So that all marginal variances equal 1,
we let 0,25 : 1, 0%, :1 —(¥2 and 0%,:1— 20,2” —(oiﬁ+y)2. We con-
sider es:0.2 for n : 100, and es:0.08 for n :1000.

Next, we consider the scenario where Y is binary. The general design is
similar, but for type I error, we set (at, )3) to either (0, 0), (es,, 0) or (0, e52),
where )3 now refers to )3] in Equation (8), and for power we set (at, )3) to
(es,, e52), (0.5esl, 1.5esz) and (1.5esl, 0.5esz). We consider es, : 0.2,
e52: 0.5 when n : 100 and es, : 0.08, e52 : 0.2 when n : 1000. The com-
binations of n, at and )3 we consider are listed in Table 2 (for normally
distributed outcome) and Supplementary Table S1 (for case-control
study, in Supplementary Materials).

2.6.2 Multiple mediators The simulations are similar to the single
mediator scenario. However, here we must not only deﬁne effects sizes
but also the proportion of mediators with each effect size. Again, we ﬁrst
consider the scenario with normally distributed variables. To obtain the
FWER, we consider either K: 10 or K: 100 null mediators. We set
K1, K2 and K3 mediators to have (cg/3) : (0,0),(0,es), and (es, 0), re-
spectively. Here, we consider (K1,K2,K3):(10, 0, 0), (7, 3, 0), (7, 0, 3)

30) and (60, 20, 20) for K: 100. We then simulate 10000 studies and
deﬁne the observed FWER to be the proportion of the studies where at
least one mediator is declared to be statistically signiﬁcant. To obtain the
power, we also add a single mediator with (at, )3) : (es, es). We discuss
the scenario of multiple mediators in Supplementary Section S3 of the
Supplementary Material. We then simulate 1000 studies and deﬁne power
to be the proportion of studies where this true mediator is declared sig-
niﬁcant. When K: 10 or 11 mediators, we consider 100 subjects and
es:0.3. When K: 100 or 101, we consider 1000 subjects and es:0.1.
So that all marginal variances equal 1, we let 0'2 : 1, 0%,, : 1 — at? and

0%, : 1 — i [12:52”, — (ing/3,» + y)2. In the Supplementary Material, we
[:1 [:1

also consider simulations with more than one true mediator, including

scenarios where one is ‘screening’ mediators.

The DAG in Figure 2 implies that the putative mediators are independ-
ent conditional on exposure. We also want to explore the beneﬁt of Test 2]
when the mediators are conditionally dependent. Speciﬁcally, we consider
the scenario with one true mediator (es:0.1) and 100 null mediators
(n : 1000), each with at,» : )3,» : 0 and divided into ﬁve correlated blocks
of equal size. Two mediators in the same block have a correlation of p,
which varies from 0 to 1, whereas any mediators in two different blocks are
independent. We calculate the power based on 10 000 simulated studies.

Next, we consider the scenario where Y is binary. The design is similar,
but we now set ((2,, [3,») to either (0, 0), (es,, 0), (0, e52) or (esl, e52), where
)3,» now refers to Equation (8). When K : 10 or 11, we consider it : 100,
es, :0.3 and esz:0.6, whereas for K: 100 or 101, we take n:1000,
es, :0.1 and esz:0.2. The combinations of K1, K2, K3 and K4 we con-
sider are listed in Tables 3 and 4, with K4 being the number of true
mediators (and therefore, just 0 or 1.).

2.7 Navy Colorectal Adenoma study

The original Navy Colorectal Adenoma case-control study (Sinha et al.,
1999) was a study of colorectal adenoma risk factors. A follow-up study
was conducted to investigate circulating metabolites in relation to self-
reported diet and colorectal adenoma in 129 cases and 129 controls.
Serum metabolites were measured by Metabolon Inc., whose methods
have been previously described (Sreekumar et al., 2009; Suhre et al.,
2011). For this analysis, the exposures of interest were the daily intake of

tionnaires and the outcome of interest was the presence of colorectal
adenoma. The prevalence of colorectal adenoma within this age group at
the time of the original study was assumed to be 0.228 (Dr Brooks Cash,
personal communication). Of the 446 known metabolites measured, we
considered only the 149 metabolites present in all study participants. The
metabolite values were batch normalized and log transformed. We normal-
ized the exposure, mediators and outcome by using the residuals from
regression analyses that included gender, age, current smoking status and
body mass index.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulations: single mediator

The type I error rates for Test 1 and Test 2 depend on the values
of at and 8. When both at : 0 and 8 : 0, both tests are extremely
conservative, with type I error rates close to 0.0025 : 0.052.
When either (at >> 0 and 8 : 0) or (at : 0 and 8 >> 0), type I
error rates are closer to 0.05 (Table 2 and Supplementary
Table Sl). Note three features. First, similar trends are observed
for normal and binomial outcomes. Second, although permuta—
tion methods for testing conditional associations are not exact,
the type I error rates are below or close to 0.05 (data not shown).
Third, Test 1 and Test 2 produce essentially identical results for
both type I error and power.

When running simulations under the alternative hypothesis,
we found that the threshold for signiﬁcance for Test 2, t,(S),

Note: Different effect sizes are considered: K, mediators have (or, 8) : (0, 0), K2 have

increased with effect size. Therefore, when at : 8 was set to be

olds to be 0.032, 0.050, 0.068, 0.086 and 0.103. Because we are
testing a composite null hypothesis, each permuted statistic still
uses the observed a? or 8 and therefore increases with the
observed values.

3.2 Simulations: multiple mediators

The FWER depends on the values of at, and 8,. When all the
mediators have at, : 8,~ : 0, all four tests are extremely conser—
vative (Tables 3 and 4). In these simulations, where all mediators
were conditionally uncorrelated, we found that power for Test 2]
was larger than the power for Tests 1B, 1] or 2B. In general, all
three tests (1B, 1], 2B) performed nearly identically, so we only
report test 2B here and in Tables 3 and 4. The results from tests
1B and 1] are provided as part of Supplementary Tables S2 and
S3. For example, with 1000 subjects, 100 null mediators and
at : 8 : 0.1 for the true mediator, we found the power for de—
tecting an association by Test 2] to be 0.657, 0.268, 0.277 and
0.243 when (K,,K2,K3) : (100, 0, 0), (70, 30, 0), (70, 0, 30) and
(60, 20, 20). In contrast, we found the power from Tests 1B, 1] or
2B, which again are essentially equivalent, to be between 0.13
and 0.14. Importantly, note that the power is greatly improved
by the joint test here, whereas if we generated independent vari—
ables when testing associations, the joint test could offer no
improvement (data not shown). Similar improvements were

subset of metabolites was associated with the exposure and a
different subset was associated with the outcome, then the
observed 5,0,“, would appear extreme as measured by either
simple null distribution.

As with any approach for testing mediation, our method pre—
sumes that the causal paths considered in Figures 1 and 2 are
correct. Thus, we assumed that the only causal paths that may
exist are from the exposure to the biomarkers, from the bio—
markers to the outcome and from the exposure directly to the
outcome. Unmeasured confounders might also lead to incorrect
inferences. Such a confounder might, for example, induce a re—
lationship between M and Y, causing 8 to appear to be non—zero.
If this same metabolite were associated with E, the result would
be a false positive. Despite this limitation, causal analysis still
offers one of the best methods for testing putative mediators.
Given the popularity of high—throughput technologies, investiga—
tors will soon require methods for testing multiple putative me—
diators. This manuscript is one of the ﬁrst to introduce possible
options.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Zinc-binding proteins are the most abundant metallo-
proteins in Protein Data Bank (PDB). Accurate prediction of zinc-
binding sites in proteins of unknown function may provide important
clues for the inference of protein function. As zinc binding is
often associated with characteristic 3D arrangements of zinc ligand
residues, its prediction may benefit from using not only the sequence
information but also the structure information of proteins.

Results: In this work, we present a structure-based method, TEMSP
(3D TEmplate—based Metal Site Prediction), to predict zinc-binding
sites. TEMSP significantly improves over previously reported best
methods in predicting as many as possible true ligand residues for
zinc with minimum overpredictions: if only those results in which
all zinc ligand residues have been correctly predicted are defined
as true positives, our method improves sensitivity from less than
30% to above 60%, and selectivity from around 25% to 80%.
These results are for predictions based on apo state structures. In
addition, the method can predict the zinc-bound local structures
reliably, generating predictions useful for function inference. We
applied TEMSP to 1888 protein structures of the ‘Unknown Function’
class in the PDB database. A number of zinc-binding sites have been
discovered de novo, i.e. based solely on the protein structures. Using
the predicted local structures of these sites, possible functional roles
were analyzed.

1 INTRODUCTION

About one-third of all proteins in nature require metal ions for
their normal structures and ﬁlnctions (Holm et (11., 1996; Matthews
et (11., 2008). In the protein structure database PDB (Bernstein et (11.,
1977), zinc is the most abundant metal ion (Babor et (11., 2008).
It has been suggested that zinc-binding proteins may comprise up to

10% of the entire human proteome (Andreini et (11., 2006). In zinc-
binding proteins, the zinc ions or their binding motifs often play
important functional roles. For example, about 40% of the zinc-
binding proteins in the human proteome are transcription factors,
in which the zinc-containing motifs are involved in DNA binding
(Andreini et (11., 2006). The remaining 60% are primarily enzymes,
in many of them zinc plays important catalytic roles (Andreini et (11.,
2006). Thus, the prediction of zinc-binding sites in proteins is of
general interest for the inference of protein function.

Metal binding sites, especially zinc sites, can be predicted based
on the sequences of target proteins. Many reasonably successful
methods are available for this purpose (Andreini et (11., 2004; Lin
et (11. , 2005, 2006; Lippi et (11., 2008; Passerini et (11., 2006; Shu et (11. ,
2008). In some methods, comparative modeling of the structures of
the target proteins are attempted to verify or improve the predictions
(Levy et (11., 2009; Passerini et (11., 2007). Recently, a method
using the sequence proﬁles of known zinc-binding domains in PDB
assisted by the so-called ‘metal-binding patterns’ has been proposed
and tested (Andreini et (11., 2009). Because it needs only the sequence
information of the target proteins, the method can be applied to
annotate ﬁill zinc proteomes from genome sequences (Bertini et (11.,
2010). However, as metal binding is very sensitive to the local
arrangements of ligand residues in the 3D space, if the 3D structure
of a target protein is available, it can be expected that much higher
accuracy can be achieved by making predictions directly based on
the structure .

Several methods were recently proposed to predict metal-
binding sites, especially zinc sites, directly based on the 3D
structures. Among them, the method MetSite uses neural networks
trained on sequence proﬁles, secondary structure states, the solvent
accessible surface areas (SASAs) as well as the inter-residue
distance matrices (Sodhi et (11., 2004). The empirical Fold-X force
ﬁeld has been developed to predict binding sites and binding
afﬁnities for water and for metal ions (Schymkowitz et (11., 2005).
Goyal and Mande reported a method based on statistically derived
geometrical constraints on zinc-binding sites (Goyal and Mande,
2008). The method CHED makes use of the properties of triads
of zinc-coordinating ligand residues to make predictions based on
apoprotein structures (Babor et (11., 2008). The method FEATURE
uses a Bayesian classiﬁer based on analyses of the properties of
amino acid residues in concentric shells around zinc ions (Ebert
and Altman, 2008). The method SitePredict uses Random Forest
classiﬁers trained on diverse ligand residue-based site properties to

De novo prediction of zinc-binding sites in proteins

 

predict binding sites for metal ions or small molecules (Bordner,
2008).

For some of these methods, apparently excellent performance,
including high sensitivity and selectivity, have been reported (Babor
et (11., 2008; Bordner, 2008; Ebert and Altman, 2008). By deﬁnition,
sensitivity is the ratio of the number of true positive (TP) predictions
over the total number of positive cases (TP+FN, FN being the
number of false negative predictions), while selectivity is the ratio of
TP over the total number of positive predictions (TP+FP, FP being
the number of false positive predictions). Obviously, these measures
depend on the exact deﬁnition of what consists of TP predictions.

In reported studies, TPs were often deﬁned using relatively loose
criteria (Babor et (11., 2008; Bordner, 2008; Ebert and Altman, 2008)
such as containing as few as only one correctly predicted zinc-
coordinating residue (Babor et (11., 2008). With such type of TP
deﬁnitions, an inaccurate prediction that mistakenly predicts all
but one of the several native zinc-coordinating residues would be
counted a TP, the same as an accurate prediction that correctly
predicts all the zinc-coordinating residues. Thus, results that are
suboptimal at least for the purpose of function inference may
produce apparently good performance. For example, although a zinc
ion is normally chelated with only three or four ligand residues, the
number of predicted ligand residues per zinc ion by some methods
reported with good performance measures is often larger than ﬁve. In
addition, many of the predicted zinc-binding sites by these methods
consist of mostly incorrect ligand residues.

We believe that for the development of zinc-binding prediction
as a tool for ﬁinction inference, it is necessary to use more stringent
criteria to judge the results. First, the inference of a protein’s
ﬁinction based on its zinc-binding site does need as many as possible
correctly predicted zinc-chelating residues. In addition, it also needs
as few as possible falsely predicted ligand residues because they are
potentially misleading. If a new method shows clear improvements
over previous ones by a criterion taking into account of these factors,
it should also improve ﬁinction inference.

Another limitation of currently available methods is that they
do not produce structural models of the zinc-bound states. Upon
zinc binding, the protein backbone conformation may mostly stay
unchanged or only change slightly (Babor et (11., 2008). However,
in more than 40% of cases, the side chain conformation of
ligand residue has been found to alter signiﬁcantly (Babor et (11.,
2008). Thus, given a prediction comprising a cluster of likely
ligand residues in their apo state conformations, it is difﬁcult to
conceive how the zinc ion would coordinate with its ligand residues,
especially when many of the predicted ligand residues are incorrect.

None of the current methods has been designed to provide a
structural model (i.e. atomic coordinates of the zinc ion and its
coordinating protein side chains) for the zinc-coordinated state. One
arguable exception is the Fold-X force ﬁeld method (Schymkowitz
et (11., 2005). However, the method uses local optimizations starting
from an input structure, and it is not clear to what extent the method
can still make correct predictions if the local conformation in the
holo state signiﬁcantly differs from the input conformation (for
example, the input may consist of an apo state in which some or
all of the ligand residues are in different side chain conformations
as compared with the holo state).

In this report, we developed a new structure-based approach
to predict zinc-binding sites. In our approach, a binding site
must consist of a certain number of appropriately arranged ligand

residues. To detect such residues, we compare the relative positions
of Ca and Cf; atoms of potential ligand residues in a target
protein with those in known zinc-binding sites. For a group of
potential ligand residues predicted to form a zinc-binding site by this
approach, atomic positions of the bound zinc and the coordinating
side chains are also predicted. By considering the positions of
the Ca and Cf; atoms, changes of side chain conformations of
ligand residues from the apo to the holo state are allowed, but of
backbone conformations are not. The method has been trained using
a selected set of zinc-binding proteins to give optimum performance
by stringent TP deﬁnitions. It was then tested on an independent
dataset. Finally, we applied the method to predict zinc-binding sites
and their local structures in proteins classiﬁed as of ‘Unknown
Function’ in PDB. The de novo predicted sites were analyzed and
possible ﬁinctional roles were assigned based on the predicted local
structures.

2 METHODS

Figure 1 shows an overview of the workﬂow. The method is brieﬂy
summarized below and details are given in the method section of
Supplementary Materials. In summary of the method, known zinc-binding
sites have been extracted from PDB structures and decomposed into pairs
of zinc-chelating residues. Each pair forms a template and all such pairs
constituted a pro-compiled template library. During the prediction, this
library is searched for templates that ‘match’ the conﬁguration of a pair of
candidate ligand residues in the target protein. The candidate ligand residue
pairs that can be matched by templates are again combined in pairs, forming
the so-called ‘pairs-of—pairs’. Each possible pair-of-pairs is ﬁltered by using
a range of geometric criteria. A pair-of-pairs passing all the ﬁlters comprises
a predicted zinc-binding site. For a predicted site, atomic coordinates of the
zinc ion and its ligand residues in the zinc-bound state are proposed based
on the local conﬁgurations of the matching templates. The method has been
optimized on a training set of target proteins (Supplementary Table Sl).
Details of parameters and their optimization are given in Supplementary
Materials. It has been tested in an unbiased way using another set of target
proteins (the independent test set) that are independent from the training set
as well as from the template library (Supplementary Table SI).

In both training and testing, the following ‘intersection over union ratio”
(IoUR) was used to quantify the accuracy of results.

This ratio balances between the numbers of correctly and wrongly predicted
ligand residues for a particular binding site. If unspeciﬁed, we have
considered prediction results with IoURZO.5 to be TPs. In additions,
performance measures under the most stringent criterion of IoUR=1 are
also reported.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Performance on the training dataset

Key geometric parameters used in TEMSP have been optimized
to achieve the best performance for the 338 target proteins in the
training set. Among the various geometric parameters, we found
that the performance of the methods, i.e. sensitivity and selectivity,
is most responsive to the distance cutoff between the two zinc
positions, each predicted for one of the candidate ligand residue
pairs in the pair-of—pairs (see also ‘S1.6 Training and testing’ section
of Supplementary Material). The prediction results on the training
set by the ﬁnal model containing the optimized parameters are
summarized in Table 1.

By the chosen TP deﬁnition, TEMSP attains a sensitivity of 89.4%
for the training sets, i.e. 422 out of the 472 zinc-binding sites in the
training set have been predicted correctly. The average IoUR value
is 0.95 for the TPs (Table 1), which is close to 1.0 and indicates that
most of the TP predictions consist of correct predictions of all ligand
residues. In addition, the average distance between the predicted and
the actual positions of the zinc ions (‘Zinc-deviation’ in Table 1)
is only 0.39 A. If TP is deﬁned with the most stringent criterion
IoUR: 1, namely, all actual ligand residues must be predicted with
no overpredictions, the number of TP cases is 352, corresponding
to a sensitivity of 74.6%. For these more stringent TPs, the average
Zinc-deviation decreases to 0.32 A.

For the training set, TEMSP predicted 10 sites which were
not labeled as zinc binding based on the original PDB data or
were of IoUR < 0.5 (FP predictions, Supplementary Table S2),
resulting in an apparent selectivity of 97.7%. These FP predictions
were individually inspected. Three of them (3C37_A, 1ADT_A and
1XRT_A, the notation standing for PDB ID plus chain ID in the PDB
entry; See also Supplementary Table S2) correspond to actual zinc-
binding sites and each of the respective predicted sites contains two
correct zinc-coordinating residues. For another FP case (1T8H_A),
although the PDB entry 1T8H contains no zinc ion coordinated with
the predicted ligand residues (H80, C125 and H142), we could ﬁnd
two other PDB entries that are highly similar both in sequence and in

structure to 1T8H (1U05 and lXAF) and each contains a zinc ion at
the corresponding site. Thus, it is highly possible that this prediction
is actually correct. For yet another FP case (3CG7_A), a manganese
ion is found to bind at the predicted site (it consisted of D15, E17 and
D184) in an isoform PDB structure (3CM5_A). Based on that some
of the different transition metal ions, including zinc and manganese,
can often bind to the same site and sometimes can be replaced by
each other, this prediction may also be actually correct. For the other
ﬁve FP results, zinc-containing isoforms or homologous proteins
were not found. Whether these predictions are correct or not cannot
be unambiguously judged based on available evidence. In any case,
the actual selectivity of TEMSP for the training dataset should be
higher than the results in Table 1.

3.2 Performance on the independent test dataset

Target proteins in the independent test set have not been considered
in parameter optimization. They are also independent from the
template library. Table 1 shows that TEMSP has more or less similar
overall performance on the independent test set as on the training
set. With an IoUR cutoff of 0.5 for TP, it identiﬁed 117 of all 136
actual zinc-binding sites, giving a sensitivity of 86.0% (Table 1).
Average IoUR for the TP cases is 0.96. TEMSP produced ﬁve
apparent FP predictions (Supplementary Table S2), resulting in a
selectivity of 95.9%. Among the FP cases, one prediction, lZFD_A,
contains two actual zinc ligand residues (Supplementary Table S2).
For another FP prediction, 3ISZ_A, a zinc ion was found to bind at
the predicted site (D100, E135 and H349) in an isoform structure
(3IC1_A, Supplementary Table S2). Only for the remaining three
FP predictions (in 3I9F_A and 2JKS_A, Supplementary Table S2),
we could not ﬁnd similar evidence to support the predictions. If
they turn out to be truly false predictions, the overprediction rate of
TEMSP for the test set is 2.2% (3 FP over 136 TP+FN). This rate
is, in fact, likely to be close to the error rates resulting from metal
ion lost during protein preparation or from data misinterpretation
during structure determination.

Depending on the purpose of the prediction, the geometric
parameters used in TEMSP can be adapted to aim at either
higher sensitivity or better selectivity. Figure 2 shows the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, i.e. the plot of sensitivity
versus (1 —selectivity). Strictly speaking, the ROC curve should be
the plot of sensitivity versus (1—speciﬁcity), where speciﬁcity is
deﬁned as the total number of FF over the total number of actual
negative cases. However, it is difﬁcult to deﬁne the total number of

actual negative cases contained in our datasets except that it must be
much larger than the number of positive cases or the number of actual
zinc-binding sites. Thus, selectivity has been used in the place of
speciﬁcity in our discussions. For TEMSP applied to the independent
test dataset, the ROC curve is signiﬁcantly above the line associated
with random predictions, suggesting good performance of the model.
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) attains a value of 0.945,
whereas a value of 1.0 represents perfect predictions.

3.3 Comparisons with other methods

Among previously reported methods, several have been reported
(Goyal and Mande, 2008; Schymkowitz et (11., 2005) or have
been shown (Babor et (11., 2008) to give much lower sensitivity
and/or selectivity as compared with TEMSP. The CHED algorithm
developed by Babor et (11. (2008) have been reported with
comparable performance, i.e. with a sensitivity of 79% at 100%
selectivity using a test set consisting of apo structures. However,
their results corresponded to a relaxed deﬁnition of TP predictions:
a predicted site containing as few as only one correct zinc-
coordinating residue was considered as a TP. On the other hand,
the independent test dataset used here consists of holo instead of
apo structures. It is thus interesting to compare TEMSP with CHED
based on the same TP criteria, using both the independent test dataset
of holo structures here and the test set of apo structures used in
reference (Babor et (11., 2008) (noted as CHED test set).

The results of the comparisons are also summarized in Table 1.
When CHED was applied to the independent test set, 112
TP predictions were made with the TP criterion IoUR30.5,
corresponding to a sensitivity of 82.4%. It also generated 11 FP
predictions, which corresponded to a selectivity of 84.2%. Both
results are only slightly worse than TEMSP. However, the average
IoUR of the TP predictions by CHED is only 0.88, suggesting that it
performed deﬁnitely worse than TEMSP in correctly predicting all
the true ligand residues without over predictions. More importantly,
if the criterion for TP is tightened to IoUR= 1, the sensitivity
and selectivity of CHED drop signiﬁcantly to 47.8 and 52.8%,
respectively. These are much lower than the corresponding values
of 73.5 and 82.0%, respectively, for TEMSP.

TEMSP was then applied to the CHED test set. With the TP
criterion set at IoUR30.5, it achieved a sensitivity of 76% and
a selectivity of 95% (Table 1). These results are also only slightly

higher than the CHED values of 72 and 90%, respectively, calculated
with the same TP criterion. However, the average IoUR of TPs by
TEMSP is 0.96, again much higher than the value of 0.73 by CHED.
If the TP criterion is tightened to IoUR= 1, TEMSP still retains a
sensitivity of 64% and a selectivity of 80%, while the corresponding
results for CHED drop to 20 and 25%, respectively.

Thus, irrespective of whether apo or holo structures are used
for prediction, TEMSP gives slightly better results than CHED if
only the presence or absence of zinc-binding sites is predicted, and
signiﬁcantly better results than CHED if the exact zinc-coordinating
residues are predicted. The latter improvement of TEMSP over
CHED is especially signiﬁcant for the CHED test set that consists
of apo structures: for 16 out of the 25 zinc-binding sites in total,
TEMSP exactly predicted all the actual zinc-coordinating residues,
while CHED only made such exact predictions for ﬁve sites.

Table 1 also indicates that the performances of both TEMSP and
CHED declined using apo structures instead of holo structures as
input. This is expected, and the declination of TEMSP results may
suggest that the assumption of unaltered backbone conformations
upon zinc binding does not always hold. On the other hand, the
declination associated with TEMSP is much less signiﬁcant as
compared with CHED. It suggests that the ﬂexible side chain model
in TEMSP can account for many of the conformational differences
between the apo and the holo states. One illustrative example is
the successful prediction by TEMSP of the zinc-binding site in the
apo structure, 1RDZ_A, contained in the CHED test set. CHED
failed to predict this site as zinc binding. Comparisons with the
corresponding holo structure (1FRP_A) indicate that zinc binding at
this site involves somewhat signiﬁcant changes in the side chain
conformations of the ligand residues (Supplementary Fig. S1).
TEMSP correctly predicted the three ligand residues from the apo
structure. In addition, Supplementary Figure S1 shows that the
predicted side chain conformations are much closer to the true holo
state structure than the apo state input structure.

It is also interesting to note that the FN predictions produced by
TEMSP and CHED do not completely overlap. For example, for the
CHED test set, out of the seven binding sites missed by CHED,
three binding sites (in proteins 1ET9_A, 1RDZ_A and 1C3P_A,
respectively) were correctly predicted by TEMSP, with all zinc-
coordinating residues correctly assigned. On the other hand, out of
the six FN binding sites of TEMSP, two binding sites (in proteins
1EMV_B and 1E65_A, respectively) were predicted by CHED with
IoUR 3 0.5. Given that both methods are highly selective, in real
applications, it may be possible to apply both methods to the same
target to improve the sensitivity ﬁirther.

Another method, FEATURE, has also been reported with
apparently good performances (a selectivity of 73.6% and a
sensitivity of 75.5% on a dataset of apo structures) (Ebert and
Altman, 2008). However, FEATURE predicts explicit positions of
the metal ion instead of the ligand residues, and TP was deﬁned as
a predicted metal position within 5 A from any of the actual ligand
residues. Thus, it is difﬁcult to make solid comparisons between
FEATURE and TEMSP or CHED. However, Table 1 shows that the
sensitivity and selectivity given by TEMSP using either holo or apo
structures as input are all higher than that reported for FEATURE,
even though the deﬁnition of TP here seems to be much more
stringent than in the reference (Ebert and Altman, 2008).

Still another method, SitePredict, have reported an excellent AUC
value of 0.964 (Bordner, 2008). However, it is not explicitly stated

how TP prediction results have been deﬁned in calculating the AUC.
In reference (Bordner, 2008), a typical prediction by SitePredict was
illustrated [Figure 1 in the reference of Bordner (2008)]. At least for
this prediction, several non-ligand residues have been mistakenly
predicted as metal binding and some true ligand residues have been
predicted only with low certainty. Such predictions would have a
low IoUR.

TEMSP predicts not only the zinc-coordinating residues but also
the binding position of the zinc ion as well as the side chain
conformations of the zinc-coordinating residues. Given the ligand
residues, the Fold-X force ﬁeld can also predict the position of the
zinc ion (Schymkowitz et (11., 2005). However, the reported average
deviation of predicted zinc positions based on holo structures by
Fold-X, 0.43 A, is larger than the average deviation of 0.38A by
TEMSP.

Another advantageous feature of TEMSP is that predictions can
be made with only the coordinates of main chain atoms (the
needed positions of C1; atoms can be easily derived from them).
As side chain conformation is not required, the method can be
applied to target proteins with only low-resolution structures, which
often contain dubious side chain conformations but somewhat
well-deﬁned main chains.

3.4 Predict zinc binding in proteins of ‘Unknown
Function’

TEMSP was applied to 1888 protein structures (Supplementary
Table S1) from PDB classiﬁed as having ‘Unknown Function’ and
determined by X-ray diffraction with resolutions higher than 2.5 A. It
predicted 186 zinc-binding sites in 145 protein structures. Among the
predicted sites, 87 sites can be conﬁrmed by the actual presence of
zinc at the predicted sites in the structures themselves (82 sites from
65 structures, Supplementary Table S4a) or in respective isoform
structures (5 sites from 4 structures, Supplementary Table S4b). For
other 36 sites, metal ions other than zinc, including manganese, iron,
cobalt, nickel, copper or cadmium ions were found in the 31 structure
entries (Supplementary Table S4c). Sites binding these transition
metals are often similar to zinc-binding site and should also have
the potential to bind zinc ions.

For the remaining predicted sites, three (from three structures
3E61_A, 3IPF_A and 1MZG_A, respectively) were located at
the artiﬁcially ﬁised His-tag tails (Supplementary Table S4d).
They are probably true zinc-binding sites but are irrelevant for
protein function. Another four sites (from four structures 1XV2_A,
3F3B_A, 2D7V_A and 2095_A, respectively) may be actually
wrong predictions (for example, with less than four predicted
ligand atoms while the structure lacked space for any additional
small molecule ligand such as water) after close inspections
(Supplementary Table S4e). The remaining 54 predicted sites are
distributed in 45 structures. They are listed in Supplementary
Table S5.

The local conﬁgurations predicted by TEMSP for each of these
54 sites were closely inspected. In most cases, the predicted ligands
were found to form reasonable zinc-coordinating structures with
no additional likely ligand except water. In only a few cases, a
likely ligand residue was not predicted. These are all indicated
in Supplementary Table S5. Then the predicted zinc sites were
empirically judged whether it could be potential ‘catalytic sites’

or ‘structural sites’, based on geometry criterion (see details in
Supplementary ‘S1 METHODS’).

In what follows, three examples from Supplementary Table S5
are discussed in details to illustrate ﬁinctional inference based
on predicted zinc-binding sites. To our knowledge, metal-binding-
related functions of these three target proteins have not been
suggested before, and the inferences here may be subjected to ﬁiture
experimental tests.

2QQY_A: this target protein from Bacillus anthracis stn Ames
folds into a ferritin-like four-helix bundle (Fig. 3a). TEMSP predicts
a binuclear zinc site with four ligand residues per zinc ion in
this target. Based on the criterion described in Supplementary ‘S1
METHODS’, the potential bizinc site is inferred as a structural site
rather than a catalytic site. Similar binuclear sites binding zinc or
iron ions can be found in some ferritin structures. In Figure 3b, the
predicted site in 2QQY_A is compared with the natural bizinc site
in mycobacterial bacterioferritin (3BKN_A). The two sites contain
the same types of ligand residues (EEEH for each zinc ion) in
similar side chain conformations. And after the ligand residues are
superimposed, the positions of the two zinc ions in the predicted
site are similar to the experimentally determined zinc positions
in 3BKN_A. In some other ferritins, iron instead of zinc have
been found to occupy the corresponding sites, and iron has been
speculated to be the native substrate for the bizinc site of 3BKN_A
(Janowski et (11., 2008). Thus, we may safely infer that the biological
function of this target protein may involve the binding to zinc or to
other transition metal ions.

2DT4_A: in this example, a metal-containing catalytic center
may be inferred. The protein, PhPPC, is a Plants and Prokaryotes
Conserved (PPC) protein from Pyrococcus horikoshii. Sequence
search using PhPPC against the non-redundant GeneBank database
detected a large protein family constituting a conserved protein
domain. However, all members of the family are so far of unknown
functions except that several members have been hypothesized to be
related to DNA binding. The crystal structure of PhPPC had been
solved by Lin et (11. (2007; PDB ID 2DT4) in the hope to obtain
more insights into its function. However, based on the metal-free
structure solved with 1.6A resolution, few conclusions regarding
possible ﬁinctions could be drawn (Lin et (11., 2007). The structure
of PhPPC is shown in Figure 3c. TEMSP predicted that three
histidine residues, H89, H91 and H105, form a zinc-binding site
(Supplementary Table S5). Structure database search detected six
2DT4-like structures with Dali Z-scores > 16 and RMSD < 1.9 A,
including 3HWU, 2H6L, 3HTN, 2HXO, 2NMU and 2P6Y. Their
sequence identities with PhPPC range from 25% to 44%. They
have all been labeled either as having unknown function or as
putative DNA-binding proteins. In all these six structures, the
histidine residues forming the predicted zinc-binding site in 2DT4
are conserved, and can also be predicted to form zinc sites by
TEMSP. Besides this, the structure 2H6L and 2P6Y actually contain
a zinc ion at this position, and in 3HTN, the site is occupied by
iron or nickel. 2DT4_A and 2H6L_A superimposed (Fig. 3e); the
distance between the predicted zinc ion in 2DT4_A and the native
zinc ion in 2H6L_A is only 0.93 A. In addition, all these seven
proteins form homotrimers as the biological unit. In the trimer
form, the predicted zinc site for 2DT4 would locate in a pocket
formed at the interface of two monomers (Fig. 3d). A glutamic
acid residue (E71) from the other monomer is located at a distance
of 4.73A from the predicted zinc ion (Fig. 3d). Similar to the

three histidine residues, this glutamic acid residue is also conserved
in all the seven structures, despite their low or moderate overall
sequence identities. Thus, the three histidine residues coordinating
zinc together with E71 may form a conserved ﬁinctional motif.
Empirically, such a motif typically appears in the catalytic center

of a metallohydrolase, such as matrix metalloproteinases and other
members of the metalloendopeptidase superfamily (Gomis-Ruth,
2003), in which a water coordinated to the histidine-coordinated
zinc assisted by a nearby carboxyl from a glutamate or aspartate
side chain acts as a nucleophile. Therefore, our results strongly

suggest that the PhPPC homotrimer unit may have metallohydrolase
ﬁinction with the predicted zinc site comprising a catalytic center.
This suggestion may be generalized to other members of this PPC
family that contain this conserved site. We note that although
supporting evidence has been discussed here, this novel inference
can be made based on applying TEMSP to the (apo state) structure of
2DT4 alone, demonstrating the useﬁilness of TEMSP in ﬁinctional
inference.

3KB4_A: the high selectivity or low FP rate of TEMSP suggests
that even without further supporting evidence, functional inference
made based solely on the predictions may still be substantially
credible. 3KB4_A is such an example, which corresponds to the
Alr8543 protein from Nostoc sp. PC C 7120. No information about its
ﬁinction could be retrieved using conventional sequence, structure or
literature searches. A potential zinc-binding site consisting of H120,
H124 and E136 was predicted by TEMSP (Supplementary Table S5).
The predicted conﬁguration for zinc binding suggested that a water
molecule together with the predicted ligands may form a reasonable
tetrahedron (Fig. 3f). Empirically, this site is more likely a catalytic
center as in different metalloenzymes than a purely structural site.
Besides this, the zinc site is located at the bottom of a pocket in which
a geranyl monophosphate (GRO) molecule was found bound to the
protein. The predicted zinc position is 3.76 A from the bound GRO.
In addition, the orientation and geometry of the GRO relative to
the predicted zinc ion is analogous to that of substrates bound in the
catalytic centers of metalloenzymes (Fig. 3f). These strongly suggest
that Alr8543 may be a metalloenzyme with the predicted zinc site as
a catalytic center located at the bottom of a substrate-binding pocket.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have developed and tested TEMSP as a method that signiﬁcantly
improves over existing method in predicting zinc binding from
protein structures. The method is de novo, namely, it does not
require any information other than the main chain structure of
the target protein itself. Thus, it can greatly improve ﬁinctional
inference based on zinc-binding site predictions, as demonstrated
by the examples. From a methodological point of View, the strategy
adopted by TEMSP may be extended to the analysis and prediction
of binding sites for other types of metal ions or small molecules. As
this method does not depend on side chain conformations, it may
also be applied in protein design to identify where to introduce new
zinc-binding sites in a target protein.

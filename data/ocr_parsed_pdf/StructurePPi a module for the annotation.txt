Abstract

Motivation: The interpretation of cancer—related single—nucleotide variants (SNVs) considering the
protein features they affect, such as known functional sites, protein—protein interfaces, or relation
with already annotated mutations, might complement the annotation of genetic variants in the ana—
lysis of NGS data. Current tools that annotate mutations fall short on several aspects, including the
ability to use protein structure information or the interpretation of mutations in protein complexes.
Results: We present the Structure—PPi system for the comprehensive analysis of coding SNVs
based on 3D protein structures of protein complexes. The 3D repository used, |nteractome3D,
includes experimental and modeled structures for proteins and protein—protein complexes.
Structure—PPi annotates SNVs with features extracted from UniProt, lnterPro, APPRIS, deSFP and
COSMIC databases. We illustrate the usefulness of Structure—PPi with the interpretation of
1027122 non—synonymous SNVs from COSMIC and the 1000G Project that provides a collection of
~172 700 SNVs mapped onto the protein 3D structure of 8726 human proteins (43.2% of the 20 214
SwissProt—curated proteins in UniProtKB release 2014_06) and protein—protein interfaces with
potential functional implications.

Predicting how single—nucleotide variant (SNV) alters the function
of protein products is a topic of growing interest in genomics and
bioinformatics (reviewed in Hecht et (11., 2013). One of the key limi—
tations of the current computational tools for the prediction of the
impact of SNVs is that protein—protein interactions are poorly con—
sidered or completely ignored. This is surprising since we know that
proteins work as part of protein complexes and interaction net—
works, and a number of databases with high—quality 3D structurally
resolved protein interactome networks are available (Meyer et (11.,

human genetic diseases (Guo et (11., 2013; Nishi et (11., 2013; Vidal
et (11., 2011; Wang et (11., 2012; Yates and Sternberg, 2013; for a re—
cent review about this topic, see Das et (11., 2014). In spite of this,
methods that allow a systematic analysis of SNVs, considering
known functional residues in spatial contact with the mutation, and
including full atom—level description of protein—protein interfaces,
are not available.

Indeed, only a few methods, e.g. PMut (Ferrer—Costa et (11.,
2005), SNPeffect (Reumers et (11., 2005), SNPs3D (Yue et (11., 2006),

PolyPhen—2 (Adzhubei et (11., 2010), PoPMuSiC (Dehouck et (11.,
2011) and MuPIT (Niknafs et (11., 2013) use full atom—level descrip—
tion of protein structures explicitly, but they do not include a
detailed information about protein—protein interfaces as part of their
algorithms (see Supplementary Table S1).

Here, we describe Structure—PPi that precisely analyzes muta—
tions data in their 3D protein complex context. This module
represents a significant improvement on existing tools in terms of:
(i) ability to map mutations onto 3D structures of protein—protein
complexes (experimental and homology—based), (ii) description
of functional residues around the SNVs in protein—protein inter—
faces, additionally Structure—PPi implements a full annotation
schema annotating post—translational modification sites, catalytic
sites, binding sites residues, Pfam domains and prediction of damag—
ing effects from state—of—the—art methods. Besides, the system selects
a single reference sequence for each protein—coding gene (i.e.
principal isoform), and provides information about cancer
somatic mutations, and their corresponding tumor origin and hist—
ology. Since this work was submitted two papers dealing with the
analysis of disease mutations at protein—protein interfaces have
appeared (Mosca et (11., 2015; Porta—Pardo et (11., 2015).

2 Implementation and capabilities

2.1 Overview

Structure—PPi offers a system to analyze SNV data in their protein
3D structure context. A genomic variant that leads to a substitution
in a particular residue of a protein isoform is linked to features asso—
ciated to that amino acid. Those features include secondary struc—
ture, post—translational modification sites, catalytic sites, binding
sites residues, Pfam domains, signal peptides, trans—membrane re—
gions, prediction of damaging effects with state—of—the—art methods
(i.e. SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT, MutationTaster, MutationAssessor,
FATHMM, VEST3, CADD) and somatic mutations extracted from:
UniProt (UniProt Consortium, 2013), InterPro (Hunter et (11., 2012),
APPRIS (Rodriguez et (11., 2013), deSFP (Liu et (11., 2013) and
COSMIC (Forbes et (11., 2011). Residues in close physical proximity
to query SNVs, are extracted from the corresponding 3D structures,
including the experimental structures and homology—based models
available in the Interactome3D (Mosca et (11., 2013) database. The
proximity information is used to generate annotations not directly
affected by the investigated mutations but that could be disrupted
by changes in the close vicinity (defaults 5A). Users may submit
batches of tens of thousands SNVs to retrieve the available func—
tional annotations for the corresponding SNVs and residues in spa—
tial contact in that protein or the corresponding protein complex
(Fig. 1). Figure 1 also shows the study of hotspot position S427 for
the ENSP00000419692 protein isoform in bladder cancer. An
assessment of Structure—PPi using a validation set (14 pathogenic
and 10 neutral) in BRCA1 BRCT domains (Lee et (11., 2010) is
shown in Supplementary Table S3. Structure—PPi achieves a level of
performance similar to that obtained by MetaSVM, a support vector
machine algorithm, which incorporate results from state—of—the—art
methods (i.e. SIFT, Polyphen2, MutationTaster, Mutation Assessor,
FATHMM and LRT) and the maximum frequency observed in the
1000G project (Liu et (11., 2013). The results are as follow:
MetaSVM (accuracy: 0.83, recall: 1.00, precision: 0.78, MCC: 0.68)
and Structure—PPi (accuracy: 0.88, recall: 0.79, precision: 1.00,
MCC: 0.78). This assessment reveals that Structure—PPi shows a bet—
ter precision than MetaSVM, and also a good agreement between
predictions and observations. In addition, Supplementary Table S3
shows the utility of Structure—PPi for providing complementary

information to the prediction methods. Indeed, this complementary
information facilitates discrimination of false—positive results, and
also identifies mutations that should be study in more details.

2.2 Coverage

Structure—PPi maps SNVs onto the protein 3D structure for 8726
human proteins (43.2% of the 20214 SwissProt—curated proteins in
UniProtKB release 2014_06). This value of 43.2% is well above the
1 8% coverage reported by MuPIT (Niknafs et (11., 2013).

2.3 Software implementation and requirements
Structure—PPi is an independent component of the Rbbt—framework
(“Ruby bioinformatics toolkit” Rbbt; https://github.com/mikisvaz/
rbbt; Vazquez et (11., 2010). Structure—PPi runs on Unix—based sys—
tems (including Linux and Mac). Structure—PPi can be accessed by
programmatic access for ruby developers, command—line mode for
power users or HTML interface through a web browser (http://
structureppi.bioinf0.cni0.es/Structure) for standard users.
Structure—PPi includes a pair—wise alignment (Smith—Waterman)
step to resolve any potential inconsistency between the isoform se—
quence and the sequence in the 3D structure, or differences between
the isoform sequence and the reference UniProt. Depending on the
database used, the throughput on a single process is around hun—
dreds or thousands per second, with less than 500 MB of memory
use. We will continue to develop the Structure—PPi, in particular its
method for parallelizing file archival and retrieval, and software
portability, to further facilitating inclusion into extended genome
annotation workﬂows. We have pre—computed annotations for all
coding nsSNVs in COSMIC v69 (~741 276), and in 1000G Project
(~285 846). The results are available through the website, and some
summary statistics and discussion of variants at protein interfaces
can be found in Supplementary Table S4. This preliminary analysis
might identify disruption of important interactions and improve our
understanding about human diseases. Structure—PPi is currently
used in different projects, including the ICGC—CLL analysis.

3 Conclusion

We present Structure—PPi, a system to facilitate the comprehensive
analysis of cancer—related SNVs, which combines 3D protein

structures of protein complexes with functional annotations from
different databases. The system implements the generally accepted
idea that strong indicators of positive selection for tumorigenesis
(driver mutations) are located in functional domain/sites or they af—
fect amino acid residues that have been shown to be important by
3D protein structure. Furthermore, the system provides information
about known functional—residues in close physical proximity to
query SNVs. Thus, Structure—PPi can provide both mechanistic and
biological insights into the role of SNVs in a given cancer.

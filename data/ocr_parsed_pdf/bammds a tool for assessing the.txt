3 RESULTS

The graphical result with all 10 modern individuals at a depth of
0.1>< can be seen on Figure 1.

We ﬁnd in the simulations that for all but two cases, we re—
cover the geographic region as the ﬁrst hit for as few as 30000
reads (~0.001><, Table 1). In the remaining two cases, the
Sardinian and the Karitiana individual, a depth of 0.1>< and
0.01><, respectively, is enough. The true nearest population was
also identiﬁed in most cases within the three closest centroids for
a depth above 0.01 (7/10 cases). For the second criteria, we ﬁnd
that in 9/10 of the cases, the WGS sample was within the popu—
lation ellipse at 0.5x and above. Only in one case (San individ—
ual) was a depth of 1x necessary to be placed within the
population ellipse.

For the ancient data, we get similar results for the Aborigine,
which is assigned to the correct geographic region (Oceania) as a
ﬁrst hit with a depth of ~0.001>< and above. At a depth higher
than 0.01><, we also recover the expected population as the
closest population. For the Anzick—l individual, presumably be—
cause of increased damage, a depth of 1x is needed to recover
the geographic region as the ﬁrst hit. On the other hand, a Native
American population is among the three closest populations
from a depth of 0.1>< and above. The results for Gus are given
in Supplementary data.

4 CONCLUSION

The tool we present in this article is based on classical MDS, a
technique that originated in the 1930s and is commonly used in
other fields [see, e.g. (Borg and Groenen, 1997) and citations
therein]. We present a tool that was designed to be practical to

assess the ancestry of mapped WGS data for samples sequenced
at low depth, assuming that a relevant reference panel in terms of
ancestry is provided. We show through simulations that useful
ancestry information can be recovered for as few as 30000
readsworresponding to a fraction (~1/60 in early 2014) of a
HiSeq 2000 lane (www.illumina.com) for a sample with 1% en—
dogenous content (or ~1/4800 of a lane for a typical modern
sample).

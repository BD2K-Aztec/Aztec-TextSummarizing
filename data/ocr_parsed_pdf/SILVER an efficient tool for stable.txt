ABSTRACT

Summary: With the advance of experimental technologies, different
stable isotope labeling methods have been widely applied to quanti-
tative proteomics. Here, we present an efficient tool named SILVER for
processing the stable isotope labeling mass spectrometry data.
SILVER implements novel methods for quality control of quantification
at spectrum, peptide and protein levels, respectively. Several new
quantification confidence filters and indices are used to improve the
accuracy of quantification results. The performance of SILVER was
verified and compared with MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer
using a large-scale dataset and two standard datasets. The results
suggest that SILVER shows high accuracy and robustness while con-
suming much less processing time. Additionally, SILVER provides
user-friendly interfaces for parameter setting, result visualization,
manual validation and some useful statistics analyses.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mass spectrometry (MS) has been applied in proteomics research
for >20 years. The great advantages in resolution, sensitivity and
accuracy make MS the dominating technology in proteomics
(Nilsson et al., 2010). As the technology improves, MS-based
quantitative proteomics has become an important research
ﬁeld in proteomics. Among the strategies developed for

quantitative proteomics, stable isotope labeling strategies have
been widely used thanks to their high accuracy and precision.

Recently, several software tools have been developed for stable
isotope labeling quantiﬁcation, such as MSQuant (Mortensen
et al., 2010) and Census (Park et al., 2008), the well-known soft-
ware package MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008) embedded with
its own search engine, named Andromeda (Cox et al., 2011), as
well as a newly published quantiﬁcation pipeline IsoQuant (Liao
et al., 2012), which was designed especially for stable isotope
labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (Ong et al.,
2002). However, there has been little attention to quantitative
quality control among these tools and there is hardly any
proper algorithm focused on this issue W ates et al., 2012). On
the other hand, the rapidly growing amount of large-scale quan-
titative proteomics data requires faster and more efﬁcient tools.

Here, we present a new efﬁcient tool, named SILVER for
stable isotope labeling data analysis with special considerations
for quality control of quantiﬁcation. SILVER introduces novel
quantiﬁcation conﬁdence ﬁlters and indices, which ﬁnally result
in accurate and robust quantification for stable isotope labeling
experiments. Meanwhile, SILVER is fast and ﬂexible by support-
ing different types of MS data such as the original raw ﬁles and
the szML format ﬁles. SILVER takes the quality control re-
sults of PeptideProphet (Keller et al., 2002) or PepDistiller (Li
et al., 2012) as the input and provides user-friendly interfaces for
parameter setting, result Visualization, manual validation and
some useful statistical analyses.

2 METHODS

SILVER is designed for comprehensive labeling MS data analysis. The
workﬂow of SILVER is shown in Figure l. The algorithms of SILVER
are classiﬁed into three levels: the spectrum level, peptide level and pro-
tein level. For isotope cluster detection, SILVER uses a novel dynamic
isotope matching tolerance algorithm for matching the experimental and
theoretical isotope clusters. During the construction of extracted ion cur-
rent (XIC) (Supplementary Fig. Sl), the signal-to-noise ratio of each
isotope peak, the goodness of least-square fitting between the theoretical
and observed isotope distribution as well as the autocorrelation coefﬁ-
cient of the labeled and unlabeled isotope clusters are determined as
quantiﬁcation conﬁdence ﬁlters at the spectrum level (Supplementary
Methods). For peptide quantiﬁcation, SILVER provides two novel quan-
tiﬁcation conﬁdence indices: the Pearson and the Spearman correlation

coefﬁcients between the labeled and unlabeled XICs, which are calculated
as measurements of XIC shape and the intensity variation, respectively.
For stable isotope labeling data with fractions such as reverse-phase
liquid chromatography separation or sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis, SILVER starts by integrating the XIC areas as
the peptide quantiﬁcation result. Then after a global linear normalization
(Callister et al., 2006) and outliers rejection, a weighted average of peptide
ratios (Wang et al., 2006) is adopted as the corresponding protein quan-
tiﬁcation result. Protein abundance is determined as the sum of its unique
peptide intensities. Finally, the protein and peptide quantiﬁcation results
are shown in ﬂexible tables (Supplementary Fig. S2), and some statistical
analyses can be further performed in user-friendly interfaces
(Supplementary Figs SS and S4). More importantly, the labeled and un-
labeled XIC plots of each peptide are provided for quantiﬁcation valid-
ation manually (Supplementary Fig. SS).

Meanwhile, to improve the efﬁciency of SILVER, a new data structure
named Ideaw is deﬁned for fast accession of every spectrum
(Supplementary Fig. S6).

3 RESULTS

SILVER was developed for fast and accurate quantification of
stable isotope labeling data. The quantitative accuracy of
SILVER was evaluated and compared with MaxQuant
(V1.3.0.5) and Proteome Discoverer (V1.3, Thermo Scientiﬁc)
using a large-scale dataset named MaxQuant dataset as well as
two standard datasets (UN and 18O labeling) (Arsova et al.,
2012; Liu et al., 2013) with different labeling ratios.

For MaxQuant dataset, only commonly quantiﬁed proteins by
the three tools were evaluated for an objective comparison. As
shown in Supplementary Figure S7, the median ratio of
SILVER’s result is the closest to the theoretical value compared
with the other two software packages. For 180 labeling dataset,
SILVER performs as well as MaxQuant for the 1:1 labeling data,
and its results are closer to the theoretical ratio for the 1:2 label-
ing data (Supplementary Fig. S8). What’s more, SILVER can
also handle 15N labeling data that is another advantage over
MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer. There are three different
ratios (H/L: 1:2, 1:5, 1:10) in the 15N labeling dataset. The pro-
tein ratio medians are all close to the theoretical values, suggest-
ing the high accuracy and sensitivity of SILVER (Supplementary
Fig. S9). These results demonstrate that SILVER is able to
handle large-scale complex stable isotope labeling data and dis-
plays a high quantitative accuracy and sensitivity despite data
complexity (Supplementary Methods).

In addition, the quantiﬁcation processing time of the three
software tools is compared on MaxQuant dataset. As shown in
Supplementary Table S1, the time consumed by SILVER is
nearly one third of that consumed by MaxQuant and even
nearly one tenth of that of Proteome Discoverer under the
same computing conditions. More details are provided in
Supplementary Methods.

4 CONCLUSION

In summary, we have developed a new efﬁcient tool named
SILVER for stable isotope labeling LC-MS data quantiﬁcation.
By using the quality control methods, SILVER can provide ac-
curate and sensitive quantiﬁcation results for SILAC, 15N and
18O labeling data with effective validation, Visualization as well
as statistical analysis functions. Other labeling strategies such as
isobaric labeling and multiplexed labeling methods will be
included in future versions.

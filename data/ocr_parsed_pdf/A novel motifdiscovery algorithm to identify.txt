Abstract

Motivation: Interplays between transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) in gene regu—
lation are implicated in various physiological processes. It is thus important to identify biologically
meaningful network motifs involving both types of regulators to understand the key co—regulatory
mechanisms underlying the cellular identity and function. However, existing motif finders do not
scale well for large networks and are not designed specifically for co—regulatory networks.

Results: In this study, we propose a novel algorithm CoMoFinder to accurately and efficiently
identify composite network motifs in genome—scale co—regulatory networks. We define composite
network motifs as network patterns involving at least one TF, one miRNA and one target gene that
are statistically significant than expected. Using two published disease—related co—regulatory net—
works, we show that CoMoFinder outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness.
We then applied CoMoFinder to human TF—miRNA co—regulatory network derived from The
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements project and identified 44 recurring composite network motifs of
size 4. The functional analysis revealed that genes involved in the 44 motifs are enriched for signifi—
cantly higher number of biological processes or pathways comparing with non—motifs. We further
analyzed the identified composite bi—fan motif and showed that gene pairs involved in this motif
structure tend to physically interact and are functionally more similar to each other than expected.
Availability and implementation: CoMoFinder is implemented in Java and available for download

a regulatory network involving only one type of regulators, a co—
regulatory network may involve transcription factors (TE),
microRNAs (miRNA) and their (shared) target genes (Martinez and
Walhout, 2009). The interplay between TE and miRNA underlies a
coordinated circuitry responsible for a variety of cellular processes
(Hobert, 2008); many of these processes are carried out by recurring
structures called network motifs.

Network motifs are recurring patterns of connectivity, occurring
significantly more frequently than expected (Alon, 2007; Milo et (11.,
2002). Identification of network motifs in the context of co—
regulatory networks can yield new mechanistic insights into
biological system and offer crucial clues into gene regulation
(Grochow and Kellis, 2007; Ideker et (11., 2011; Martinez and
Walhout, 2009). For instance, it has been shown that miRNA—
mediated feed—forward loops (FELs) and feedback loops (FBLs)
enhance the robustness of gene regulation in mammalian genomes
(Ebert and Sharp, 2012; Herranz and Cohen, 2010; Tsang et (11.,
2007). Furthermore, TE—mediated EELs were theoretically proved to
ensure the stability of gene expression against stochastic ﬂuctuations
(Riba et (11., 2014), whereas the TE <—> miRNA FBLs are demon—
strated to provide ‘high ﬂux capacity’ to coordinate the high infor—
mation ﬂow that passes through the miRNA and TE within the
FBLs (Martinez et (11., 2008).

Various methods have been developed to detect network motifs.
However, only a handful of them could be applied on co—regulatory
networks. As one of the widely used tools (Grochow and
Kellis, 2007; Kashani et (11., 2009; Kashtan et (11., 2004;
Khakabimamaghani et (11., 2013; Li et (11., 2012; Panni and Rombo,
2013), FANMOD is an efficient motif detection algorithm, which
takes into account networks with different types of nodes and edges
by exploiting the concept of graph isomorphism (Junttila and Kaski,
2007; McKay and Piperno, 2014; Wernicke, 2006). Although
FANMOD has been widely applied to many kinds of biological net—
works (Gerstein et (11., 2012; Morgan and Soltesz, 2008; Roy et (11.,
2010), its randomization scheme is limited to covering only a small
range of subgraphs frequency reflected by the low—variance of the
number of certain subgraphs in the random network ensemble
(Beber et (11., 2012; Megraw et (11., 2013). Besides, FANMOD is not
capable of utilizing multi—cores. WaRSwap is another network shuf—
ﬂing algorithm, which was proposed to discover network motifs in
large TE—miRNA co—regulatory networks (Megraw et (11., 2013).
Brieﬂy, WaRSwap breaks the co—regulatory network into separate
layers according to the node types and then shufﬂes the regulatory
edges in each layer, while keeping the node degree distribution
unchanged. Notably, WaRSwap is only a randomization technique
that must be used accompanied with a motif discovery tool such
as FANMOD, which substantially limits its application scope.
Additionally, WaRSwap requires predefining values of several free
parameters to adjust the sampling weights during the randomization
process, which may affect the final outcomes. The limitations of
these existing methods make it necessary to develop new method
that can effectively detect reliable network motifs in large co—
regulatory networks consisting of miRNAs, TEs and target genes.

In this study, we propose a novel network motif search algorithm
called CoMoFinder, which is developed based on a parallel subgraph
enumeration strategy to efficiently and accurately identify composite
motifs in large TE—miRNA co—regulatory networks. Distinct from pre—
vious algorithms, CoMoFinder seeks for a maximum difference be—
tween a given co—regulatory network and its randomized counterpart
to ensure sufficient shufﬂing during the randomization process, which
provides a reliable background distribution of the random network
ensemble for motif discovery. Compared with existing methods that

were applied to the published co—regulatory networks, CoMoFinder
achieved favorable performance in terms of accuracy, robustness and
computational complexity. After having established its superior per—
formance, we next applied CoMoFinder to systematically discover
recurring 4—node motifs in human co—regulatory network derived
from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium.
We discovered 44 composite motifs involving the previously well—
studied 3—n0de EELs and are corroborated by a number of biological
evidences such as enrichment for Gene Ontology (GO) terms or ca—
nonical pathways. Together, we present a novel framework for net—
work motif discovery, demonstrate its utility in analyzing large
human co—regulatory networks and envision it being a useful tool for
future analyses of various large biological networks.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Notations

The main purpose of CoMoFinder is to detect all the composite
network motifs in a given TE—miRNA co—regulatory network.
Here, we define a network G(V, E) that consists of miRNAs,
TEs and their target genes as a TE—miRNA co—regulatory network.
V : {Vm, Vt, Vg} is a finite set of vertices, where Vm, V, and Vg de—
note the vertices set of miRNAs, TEs and target genes, respectively.
E E (V X V) is a finite set of directed edges, where e(n,v) E E indi—
cates a regulation from a source vertex u to a target vertex v.
Assuming no direct regulations between miRNAs, in total there are
five types of regulations: miRNA —> TE, miRNA —> gene,
TE —> miRNA, TE —> TE and TE —> gene. A composite (or CO—
regulatory) subgraph GS : (VS, E5) of G : (V, E) is then defined as
a weakly connected subgraph that contains at least one vertex from
each vertex set {Vm, Vt, Vg}. Notably, the smallest size [2 of the com—
posite subgraphs in our study is 3, Le. the number of distinct vertex
types. For clarity, we simply use the integers {0, 1, 2} to denote the
vertex types of miRNA, TE and target gene accordingly in our ana—
lysis. For example, a TE—mediated EFL which consists of three regu—
lations (i.e. miRNA —> TE/gene, TE —> gene) could be denoted as
011001000_012, where the substring before ‘_’ stands for the regu—
lation relations among the three factors and the substring after ‘_’
corresponds to the types of the three nodes (i.e. 012 encodes
miRNA, TE and gene, respectively).

2.2 Method overview

The general framework of CoMoFinder can be divided into three se—
quential steps: (i) composite subgraph enumeration; (ii) grouping
composite subgraphs into isomorphic classes and recording their
number of occurrences and (iii) generating a random network ensem—
ble and calculating the statistical significance for each composite sub—
graph class. Figure 1 presents an overall description of the algorithm.

2.3 Size—kcomposite subgraph enumeration and
classification

Given a TE—miRNA co—regulatory network G, the algorithm
CoMoFinder enumerates all of the size—k composite subgraphs. To
use node indices to eliminate repetitive enumerations and extensions
in the following analysis, our algorithm first groups the vertices of dif—
ferent types separately and sequentially. In particular, we first read all
the miRNAs from the network, then all the TEs and last the target
genes. Once the different types of nodes are arranged in order,
CoMoFinder then extends every miRNA in the miRNA list to find all
the composite subgraphs that contain at least one node from each
node type. During the extension process, we employ a similar strategy

Fig. 1. An overall workflow of CoMoFinder. Given a co-regulatory network
involving miRNAs, TFs and target genes, CoMoFinder first divides the miRNA
list into 0 independent groups, enabling multi-threaded computations. Based
on the topological properties, each subgraph is then assigned with a refined
canonical label associated with an isomorphic class. CoMoFinder then tries to
generate random networks with maximum difference from the observed net-
work. Finally, the significance of motif occurrences is tested relative to the
background distribution constructed from the random network ensemble

as FANMOD (Wernicke, 2006) by recursively adding the valid neigh—
bors to the current subgraph. We implicitly build a tree based on the
neighborhood relationship, where the current miRNA is the root and
the maximum depth of the tree is k. We then recursively descend the
tree from the root nodes and choose possible child nodes at each level
till the subgraph reaches the required size. There are three restrictions
to choose a child node while descending the tree: (i) a child can be
chosen if and only if it is in the exclusive neighborhood with respect
to the current subgraph; (ii) all of the children in a particular tree
must have numerical labels larger than that of the root node and (iii)
only children of a specific node type can be chosen if there is a node
type requirement. By recursively finding the valid neighbors, we ex—
tend the root node to the required size of composite subgraphs. In
addition, we use a ‘divide and conquer’ approach by splitting the
miRNA list into c groups according to the number of available pro—
cessors and extending the c groups in parallel. The three aforemen—
tioned restrictions on extending the subgraphs ensure that the
algorithm enumerates each composite subgraph exactly one time in
either a linear or a parallel process. Moreover, by adding the node
type restrictions during the enumeration process, the search space of
our algorithm is significantly reduced compared with FANMOD.
Algorithm 1 outlines the corresponding pseudocode.

After enumerating all of the size—k composite subgraphs in G, the
algorithm needs to classify them into different isomorphic classes.
Popular network motif discovery algorithms resort to graph iso—
morphism tools such as NAUTY (McKay and Piperno, 2014),
SAUCY (Darga et (11., 2004) and Bliss (Junttila and Kaski, 2007).
However, in the context of co—regulatory networks, we could use a

more straightforward method to efficiently group composite sub—
graphs into isomorphic classes because (i) the size [2 of the composite
network motifs in our study is moderate (i.e. 3 and 4), making ex—
haustive enumeration feasible and (ii) the number of distinct compos—
ite subgraph isomorphic classes is quite small compared with the
number of enumerated composite subgraphs. To take advantage of
this feature, CoMoFinder separates the isomorphism testing process
from the enumeration process. It first enumerates all the subgraphs
and directly groups them into classes without considering their iso—
morphism. After the enumeration process is finished, the algorithm
then determines the isomorphism among subgraph classes and merges
them accordingly. This feature is distinct from FANMOD and
WaRSwap, which calculate the graph canonical labels for each enum—
erated subgraph and conduct billions of the graph isomorphism tests
during the enumeration process. To obtain a refined canonical label
for each subgraph class during the isomorphism testing process, we
simply calculate all the combinations and select the lexicographically
largest one for the adjacency matrix with the restriction that the nodes
must be in the order of miRNAs at first, TFs at second and target
genes at last. To distinguish different composite subgraphs with the
same canonical labels, we also concatenate the node types for each
node at the end of the subgraph labels (Fig. 1).

2.4 Network randomization

The aim of motif discovery is to compare the frequency of particular
subgraphs in the input network with its frequency in randomized
networks and see if they are significantly enriched/depleted in the
given network (Megraw et (11., 2013). The generation of the random—
ized network ensemble is therefore a key step of the algorithm since
it highly affects the statistical significance for each isomorphic class.
Here, we propose a new network randomization strategy to maxi—
mize the difference between the observed and shufﬂed network
while maintaining the basic network topology including the in/out
degree for each node. Specifically, we first break the co—regulatory
network into several subnetvvorks, which only contain certain types
of nodes and edges. To keep the topology of the co—regulatory net—
work unchanged as far as possible during the shufﬂing process, we
also take bidirectional regulations between regulators as a distinct
edge type. Therefore, a common co—regulatory network would be
separated into seven network subtypes, corresponding to miRNA —>
TF/gene unidirectional regulations, miRNA/T F <—> TF bidirectional
regulations or TF —> miRNA/TF/gene unidirectional regulations.
Our algorithm then seeks for a maximum difference between the
given network and each of the randomized subnetvvorks to avoid
either ‘under—shufﬂing’ 0r ‘over—shufﬂing’ situation during the ran—
domization process. By ‘under—shufﬂing’, we refer to the fact that
during the edge swap procedure, only a small portion of the switch—
able edges are actually swapped; whereas for ‘over—shufﬂing’ situ—
ation, we meant that edges which are switched at first are switched
back after a certain period of time. Both of the situations should be
avoided as much as possible as we want the subnetvvorks to be suffi—
ciently randomized. Suppose the total number of edges in a given
network is E, the theoretical maximum number of different edges
Em between a given network and a fully shufﬂed network should be
0 3 EU) 3 E. For each subnetwork, we choose two edges (e.g. X1 —>
Y1, X2 —> Y2) to swap only if the observed network does not con—
tain any of the new edges after the swap (e.g. X1 —> Y2, X2 —> Y1)
(Fig. 1); otherwise the switching is prohibited. We repeat this
process until all edges are fully shufﬂed or the algorithm reaches a
pre—defined number of iterations (default: 100). Thus, our approach
ensures that the network is randomized sufficiently and provides a

reliable background random network ensemble to evaluate the sig—
nificance for all the composite subgraphs.

2.5 Motif evaluation

Three standard statistical measures are used in our approach to
evaluate the significance of each subgraph found in the input net—
work based on the observed frequency, Z score and P value (defin—
itions are provided in Supplementary Information). In this study, we
generated 1000 randomized networks for each observed network
using the proposed edge—switching scheme and set the cutoffs for Z
score, P value and frequency to 2, 0.01 and 5, respectively.
Subgraphs that satisfy Z score > 2, P value < 0.01 and frequency >
5 at the same time are considered as motifs.

2.6 Method comparisons

To compare the performance of our method, we applied two
other leading methods in detecting network motifs: FANMOD
and WaRSwap to the same testing data. FANMOD is one of the
most popular motif discovery tools that can cope with colored
networks. WaRSwap is based on FANMOD with modification
on the randomization scheme to enable motif analysis on large

multi—layer co—regulatory networks. The source code of FANMOD
and WaRSwap was downloaded at http://theinf1.informatik.uni—
jena.de/m0tifs/ and http://megraw.cgrb.0reg0nstate.edu/softward
WaRSwap/, respectively. Default parameters were used for both
tools. As the main focus of CoMoFinder is to find composite net—
work motifs, we only chose network motifs consisting of miRNAs,
TFs and genes from both methods to make fair comparisons.

2.7 Data collection

Because of the computational limitation of FANMOD and
WaRSwap, we used two small—scaled published co—regulatory net—
works: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Sun et (11., 2012) and
Alzheimer disease (AD) (Jiang et (11., 2013) for method comparison.
After established the model confidence, we then applied
CoMoFinder to a much larger network derived from ENCODE pro—
ject to elucidate novel mechanistic design in a more unbiased human
co—regulatory network. The GBM data were downloaded from the
Supplementary File, Supplementary Table S7 of Sun et al. and
AD data were obtained from the Supplementary File S3 of Jiang
et al. The processed ENCODE data were retrieved from the consor—
tium website (enets2.Proximal_filtered.txt, enets10.TF—miRNA.txt
and enets11.miRNA—gene.txt, http://enc0denets.gersteinlab.org/).
Details of the three datasets are listed in Table 1.

covered 10/ 10 and 219/218 different types of composite subgraphs
for GBM/AD co—regulatory network, respectively. Among the 10/10
size—3 composite subgraphs, CoMoFinder only identified 1 motif for
each dataset, which is in agreement with FANMOD and WaRSwap,
whereas for the 219/218 size—4 composite subgraphs, CoMoFinder
identified 31/31 network motifs, which differs substantially from
those detected by FANMOD and WaRSwap. Because of the smaller
number of 3—n0de motifs discovered, we hereafter only focused on
the results derived from 4—n0de motif analysis below due to the
much larger search space and the gain of statistical power. Because
the frequency of the composite subgraphs highly affects the statis—
tical significance of motif outputs, we first examined for each
method the variance of the differences between the number of com—
posite subgraphs N, found in the 1000 shufﬂed networks and the
observed network (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S1). Here, we expect

the random networks to have similar number of subgraphs to that
of the observed network, such that the motifs identified in the
observed network in the subsequent steps are not due to the change
in search space size. Indeed, CoMoFinder and FANMOD both
maintain a similar number of composite subgraphs in the random—
ized networks comparing with the observed networks; in contrast,
the total number of composite subgraphs is substantially lower in
the WaRSwap—randomized networks. These results suggest that
WaRSwap may overestimate the significance of candidate sub—
graphs. Indeed, we found that WaRSwap predicted a much larger
set of the motifs than CoMoFinder or FANMOD did (Fig. 3).
Importantly, CoMoFinder—derived motif sets have significant over—
lap with the motif sets derived from the other two methods and
identified more motifs than FANMOD. Thus, CoMoFinder appears
to achieve a good balance between sensitivity and specificity com—
paring with FANMOD and WaRSwap.

3.2. Power analysis

To more rigorously evaluate the statistical power of WaRSwap,
FANMOD and CoMoFinder, we next set out to construct an empir—
ical gold standard motif set. As FANMOD identifies the least num—
ber of motifs, the results would bias toward FANMOD if we choose
the intersection of the motifs from all three methods as gold stand—
ard. We thus select motifs that were identified by at least two of the
three methods as the gold—standard motif set to avoid such bias. In
total, we obtained 29 and 30 such motifs for GBM and AD, respect—
ively. We then constructed for each method the precision/recall (PR)
as well as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using
the Z scores as metric. As shown in Figure 4, CoMoFinder outper—
formed FANMOD and WaRSwap on both test datasets in terms of
area under the PR or ROC curves (AUROC or AUPRC). We also
tested the performance of CoMoFinder by using motifs detected
only by FANMOD or WaRSwap as an alternative gold—standard
motif set and compared the AUPRC and AUROC of CoMoFinder
with that of the other method (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). The
results are consistent with Figure 4. Moreover, we constructed a syn—
thetic network based on network motifs and compared the

performance of three methods (Supplementary Information, Section
3). As expected, our method outperformed FANMOD and
WaRSwap on the synthetic network as well. The superior perform—
ance of our algorithm is perhaps attributable to its ability to effect—
ively control for systematic bias of the observed networks via a more
sensible randomization scheme, which would otherwise produce
misleading results.

3.3 Robustness analysis

To compare the robustness of three methods, we randomly removed
10—50% of the edges and re—evaluated the AUROC and AUPRC.
CoMoFinder maintains its superior performance up to 30% edge
removal (Fig. 5). Though the robustness of WaRSwap is generally
consistent against edge removal, its performance remains at a lower
level compared with CoMoFinder and FANMOD from 0 to 30%
stage. FANMOD exhibits similar trends as CoMoFinder throughout
the process, while its performance continually worse than
CoMoFinder. Overall, CoMoFinder appears to be the most robust
and accurate method among the three tested approaches.

3.4 Computational complexity
We next examined the time complexity of the three methods by eval—
uating their computational time used for subgraph enumeration and

classification process. Because WaRSwap directly adopts these two
processes from FANMOD, here we only compared CoMoFinder
with FANMOD. Experiments were performed on a computer clus—
ter which contains 32 Dual—Core AMD Opteron (tm) 8218
Processors and 64 GB of memory. For small—scaled co—regulatory
networks such as GBM and AD, it took less than 305 for both
algorithms to finish enumeration and classification of composite
subgraphs of size 3 or 4 (Table 2). For large co—regulatory network
such as ENCODE, our program completed the subgraph census pro—
cess of all the size—4 composite subgraphs in 3605 with 32 cores,
while it took about 5 h for FANMOD to finish the same procedure
(Table 2). Moreover, FANMOD stores all the searched subgraphs in
memory and outputs them all at once when required, which would
cause memory overhead with the exponentially increased number of
subgraphs. In contrast, CoMoFinder is more memory efficient as it
routinely outputs each of the searched subgraphs to intermediate
files instead. Taken together, CoMoFinder is more efficient than
FANMOD in searching for composite motifs in terms of both com—
putational time and memory usage since it not only has much
smaller search space but also can leverage multiprocessors.

3.5 Overlap between motifs discovered from

GBM, AD and ENCODE

Encouraged by the aforementioned results, we next applied
CoMoFinder to a much larger human TF—miRNA co—regulatory
network derived from ENCODE project. After a full enumeration
and classification of all the composite subgraphs of size 4 in the co—
regulatory network, CoMoFinder found 256 size—4 subgraph types,
of which 44 are considered as network motifs (Supplementary Table
S1 and Fig. S4). Among these 44 recurring TF—miRNA motifs, 9
were also observed in the GBM and AD co—regulatory networks
(Supplementary Fig. S5). We then tested the overlap significance be—
tween the motif sets detected in each of the three co—regulatory net—
works by hypergeometric test. The overall unique composite
subgraph types in GBM U ENCODE, AD U ENCODE and GBM U
AD are 258, 258 and 242, whereas the number of common motifs
between GBM/ENCODE, AD/ENCODE and GBM/AD is 9, 9 and
3, respectively. We observed a significant overlap between GBM
(AD) and ENCODE datasets (hypergeometric test, P value: 0.02),
suggesting that the common motifs we identified in ENCODE data—
set are recurrent among diverse datasets.

3.6 Functional analysis of the identified motifs

To further ascertain the functional relevance of the 44 detected
TF—miRNA co—regulatory motifs, we next examined whether they
are more biologically meaningful than the remaining 212 non—
motifs. To this end, we first merged the corresponding subgraph
instances within each motif or non—motif based on the same miRNA
and TF regulators to get a list of common gene sets and then counted
the number of significant GO terms (biological process) or canonical
pathways obtained from MSigDB (Subramanian et (11., 2005) for
each gene set with False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.1 (hypergeomet—
ric P value adjusted by Benjamini—Hochberg method).
Encouragingly, the 44 predicted motifs are enriched for significantly
higher number of meaningful biological pathways or processes com—
pared with non—motif instances (Fig. 6A).

To demonstrate the potential gain of mechanistic insights from
our motif analysis, we further studied one of the 44 motifs, which is a
composite bi—fan motif involving two genes that are co—regulated by
one miRNA and one TF (Fig. 6B). In total, there are 258 166 distinct
gene pairs with 5360 distinct genes involved in this motif. We then

tested whether gene pairs involved in this motif structure tend to phys—
ically interact with each other. We first obtained 83 826 experimen—
tally confirmed human protein—protein interactions (PPIs) from
BioGrid database (Stark et (11., 2006). Among the 258 166 distinct
gene pairs involved in this specific co—regulatory motif, 861 pairs share
BioGrid—derived PPI. To ascertain the statistical significance of the
observed overlap, we randomly selected the same number of gene
pairs from the same gene set and counted how many gene pairs have
physical interactions by chance. Indeed, the observed PPI count (861)
is located at the far right tail of the background distribution, suggest—
ing that the gene pairs involved in the motif have a strong tendency to
interact with each other (Fig. 6C). We next tested whether gene pairs
within this bi—fan motif tend to have more functional similarities
measured by the following equation:

(AgoﬂBgo)/min (IAgOIIIBgoI) (1)

where Ag(, and Bg0 are the GO annotations shared by genes A and B.
We first filtered out the genes that do not have mapped GO terms
and their involved gene pairs. This resulted in 3153 genes and
100 373 gene pairs. We then repeated the same permutation test by
randomly selecting the same number of gene pairs and calculating
the functional similarities for them. Indeed, the result suggests that
the gene pairs involved in the motif construct have higher level of
functional similarities than the random selected pairs (Fig. 6D).
Together, our motif analysis revealed a parsimonious and biologic—
ally relevant ‘evolutionary principle’ in regulatory network where
genes that are co—regulated by TFs and miRNAs have strong ten—
dency to physically interact or are more functionally related compar—
ing with gene pairs at random.

4 Discussion

It has been appreciated that gene regulatory network in metazoans
are complex and involve multiple layers and distinct type of regula—
tors, e.g. regulations at the transcriptional or post—transcriptional
level and regulations by TF or by miRNA (or RNA—binding protein).

An important goal in systems biology is to accurately recapitulate
co—regulatory networks to investigate how different types of regula—
tors interact with each other. Accurate network motif discovery
plays a pivotal role in studies of complex networks as they provide a
systematic way to reveal the intrinsic co—regulatory patterns among
multiple types of regulators. However, detecting network motifs in
arbitrarily complex networks remains computationally intractable
and challenging. In this study, we developed a novel de novo motif
finding algorithm called CoMoFinder to discover co—regulatory net—
work motifs each involving at least one TF, one miRNA and one tar—
get gene. Here, we define network motif as network patterns
consisting of miRNAs, TFs and target genes that occur significantly
in higher frequencies than expected. The novelty of our algorithm is
3—fold: (i) we first proposed an efficient enumeration process specif—
ically for finding co—regulatory subgraphs of moderate size; (ii) we
then introduced a refined canonical labeling method together with a
new graph isomorphism testing strategy to effectively classify these
composite subgraphs into different isomorphic groups and (iii) we
also proposed a new randomization strategy by breaking the
co—regulatory network into different layers and seeking for the max—
imum difference between the original network and the randomized
network in each layer. Notably, FANMOD (Wernicke, 2006) and
WaRSwap (Megraw et (11., 2013) use canonical labeling generated
by a practical graph isomorphism algorithm NAUTY, which takes
the diagonal of the adjacency matrix to denote the node types.
Different from these previous approaches, our refined canonical
labeling method can easily differentiate composite subgraphs with
or without self—regulations/interactions in co—regulatory networks.
Furthermore, our randomization algorithm is applicable to co—
regulatory networks containing multiple types of edges including
undirected edges such as PPI and directed repression/activation
edges. In contrast, WaRSwap can only be applied on directed c0—
regulatory networks.

To demonstrate the utility of CoMoFinder, we compared it with
FANMOD and WaRSwap on published co—regulatory networks of
GBM (Sun et al., 2012) and AD (Jiang et al., 2013). Because the
range of co—regulatory subgraphs and their isomorphic classes are
the same, the performance of each method solely depends on their
constructed background network distributions. By examining the
distributions of composite subgraphs generated by each randomiza—
tion technique, we found that CoMoFinder and FANMOD could
maintain a similar number of composite subgraphs as in the
observed network, whereas WaRSwap—derived random networks
lack a substantial number of composite subgraphs. The results thus
indicate that WaRSwap tends to generate more statistically signifi—
cant network patterns as network motifs improperly comparing
with CoMoFinder and FANMOD. Based on the overlaps of motifs
found by each method, CoMoFinder achieved a good balance com—
paring with FANMOD and WaRSwap, which appear to be too
stringent and too lenient, respectively. Moreover, we conducted
rigorous power analysis using an empirical gold standard motif set.
Encouragingly, CoMoFinder achieved consistently the greatest area
under the curves. We also tested the robustness of each method
upon random removals of edges in the given networks and showed
that CoMoFinder is relatively robust up to 30% of edge removal.
Together, the results corroborate the reliability and stability of
CoMoFinder. We then applied CoMoFinder to a human c0—
regulatory network derived from ENCODE project, which is
much larger than the GBM and AD networks. We detected 44
co—regulatory network motifs of size 4 and found a significant
overlap between motifs from ENCODE and GBM/AD dataset. The
functional analysis revealed that the 44 motifs are significantly

enriched for higher number of meaningful biological pathways or
processes compared with non—motif instances. Among the 44 motifs,
35 of them involve two TFs, one miRNA and one target gene; eight
of them involve one TF, two miRNAs and one target gene; only one
of them involve two genes with one TF and one miRNA. We further
investigated the latter motif and found that the gene pairs involved
in this motif tend to physically interact with each other and have
more functional similarities. In terms of computational time effi—
ciency, CoMoFinder leverages multicores of modern CPU, which
can provide substantial speed—up in running time over single—
threaded algorithms such as FANMOD and WaRSwap. In particu—
lar, CoMoFinder could gain an almost linear speed—up as increase of
the CPU cores.

In summary, CoMoFinder is a reliable and efficient tool that can
detect co—regulatory network motifs in large—scale datasets.
Nevertheless, as the main focus of our method is to find network
motifs consisting of miRNAs, TFs and genes, one of the limitations
of CoMoFinder is that it is only applicable to co—regulatory net—
works involving these elements up to now. We also want to stress
that the miRNAs examined in our work represent both miRNA pre—
cursors (mir) and the mature forms (miR). However, multiple dis—
tinct precursors may give rise to identical mature sequences that
target the same set of genes, while regulated by very distinct set of
TFs. Since precursors typically reside within gene introns and are
often subject to co—regulation with their host gene, the TF —>
miRNA regulatory relations usually involve host genes and precur—
sor (i.e. TF —» gene —> mir —> miR). This also implies the existence
of miR —> gene —> mir regulation, which would imply an indirect
miRNA —> miRNA regulation. Thus, it would be ideal to consider
miR and mir as two separate node types. Although in this work we
did not take the indirect regulations into consideration,
CoMoFinder is able to deal with this type of regulations, which can
be explicitly specified by users in the input co—regulatory network.
The general framework of CoMoFinder will be further extended to
other types of composite networks with arbitrary numbers of node
types in the future.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Chimera is a Bioconductor package that organizes, anno-
tates, analyses and validates fusions reported by different fusion de-
tection tools; current implementation can deal with output from
bellerophontes, chimeraScan, deFuse, fusionCatcher, FusionFinder,
FusionHunter, FusionMap, mapSpIice, Rsubread, tophat-fusion and
STAR. The core of Chimera is a fusion data structure that can store
fusion events detected with any of the aforementioned tools. Fusions
are then easily manipulated with standard R functions or through the
set of functionalities specifically developed in Chimera with the aim
of supporting the user in managing fusions and discriminating false-
positive results.

Availability and implementation: Chimera is implemented as a
Bioconductor package in R. The package and the vignette can be
downloaded at bioconductor.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fusion genes, also known as chimeras, have become crucial in
the areas of biomarkers and therapeutic targets investigation.
The emergence of deep sequencing of the transcriptome has
opened many opportunities for the identification of this class
of genomic alterations, leading to the discovery of novel chimeric
transcripts in cancers. A signiﬁcant number of bioinformatics
algorithms have been developed to detect fusion genes (Beccuti
et al., 2013). Recently, we have shown that the performances of
such tools can be quite variegated and that their false-positive
detection rate can be a critical issue (Carrara et al., 2013)
(Carrara et al., 2013). Most tools detect fusion events in two
steps: (i) alignment to a reference genome to detect discordant
alignments, and (ii) reﬁnements of fusion candidates with
removal of false-positive results. The second step is particularly
critical, as each tool implements a different set of filters (Beccuti

et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), and users have limited control on
them. As each fusion detection tool has a speciﬁc combination of
alignment and ﬁltering approaches, results produced by each
tool are only partially comparable with the others’ (Carrara
et al., 2013a,b). Thus, although the combination of the results
derived from different tools can increase the number of true fu-
sions detected, it also signiﬁcantly increases the number of false-
positive results (see Supplementary Material). The Bioconductor
package Chimera, reported in this note, provides a common
framework to manipulate, analyze and filter fusion events de-
tected by a variety of fusion detection tools. Chimera is based
on typical R data structures, which allows its users to take ad-
vantage also of the full set of R functionalities.

2 DESCRIPTION

The ﬂow of analysis supported by Chimera is described in
Figure l, and it is exemplified in the note’s Supplementary
Material. With the functions made available by Chimera, the
user can import data from 11 different fusion detection tools,
represented on top of Figure 1, into a list of fusions. Each fusion
stores the genomic break point and all the information that
can be derived from the output of fusion detection tools
(e.g. number of spanning and encompassing reads supporting
the fusion junction, splicing pattern used and transcripts involved
in the fusion). As each fusion detection tool might rely on
different gene annotations, the import function recovers the
HUGO (Seal et al., 2011) symbols for the genes involved in
the fusion, by overlapping the fusion break points to the genes’
genomic location stored in the Bioconductor package
(Gentleman et al., 2004) org.Hs.eg.db, which contains a
genome-wide annotation based on Entrez Gene identiﬁers.

Thus, a fusion involving two annotated genes will be described
as SymbolX:SymbolY. In case a break point is located in a
non-coding genomic region, it is annotated using its genomic
coordinates (e.g. NBPFl:chr14:81937890-81937920).

A list of fusions can be manipulated, as in Figure 1, using basic
R list functions (e.g. concatenation) or with the set of
Chimera ‘fusion queries’, e.g. function fusionName extracts
the fusion name in the above described format
(e.g. SPDYE8P2SLC24A5), function prettyPrint stores fusions

2.1 Fusion ﬁltering

Once the user has created and inspected the fusion list with the
above functionalities, he/she might decide to ﬁlter the fusions
through a select/exclude mechanism. Available ﬁltering criteria
are as follows: (i) a (user deﬁned) threshold for the number of
encompassing/spanning reads; (ii) a speciﬁc subset of fusion
names; (iii) the presence of annotated gene names in fusions
(e.g. SPDYE8P2SLC24A5 is kept, NBPFl:chr14:81937890—
81937920 is excluded); (iv) fusions belonging to long distance
exons of the same gene (e. g. SPDYE8P: SPDYE8P is discarded)
and (V) presence of an intron at the fusion junction. This last
ﬁlter is justiﬁed by the fact that analysis is performed on mature
mRNAs. Thus, in case long introns are retained at the fusion
break point, it is likely that such fusion event will not be trans-
lated into a functional protein.

2.2 Annotation

A user willing to complete, or enrich, fusion data can use
Chimera functionalities for annotation (‘Annotations’ block in
Fig. 1). The annotation facility allows to generate (i) the nucleo-
tide sequence of a (list of) fusions (chimeraSeqSet); (ii) the
number of supporting reads; and (iii) the list of fusion encoded
peptides.

This additional information could be used as ﬁnal output or to
enrich the information present in a fusion object. In particular,
the output of chimeraSeqSet is a R DNAStringSet object that
can be exported as a fasta ﬁle and that can enrich the fusion
information (with the method addRNA). This output can also be
used by the function fusionPeptides to explore the fusion at the
protein level (the function retrieves the peptide regions involved
and evaluates whether the fusion will produce an in-frame poly-
peptide). Chimera also embeds Oncofuse (Shugay et al., 2013), a
naive Bayes Network Classifier that provides a variegated anno-
tation of fusions, as well as a score for the probability that a
fusion acts as tumor driver.

2.3 Validation

Finally, a user can take advantage of Chimera to perform a first
step of validation, which can be useful given the high number of
false-positive results reported, in most cases, by fusion detection
tools. Fusion break points are assessed by de novo assembly using
GapFiller (Nadalin et al., 2012). GapFiller is a seed-and-extend
method able to correctly ﬁll the gap between paired reads, thus it
generates accurate longer sequences with respect to input reads.

The supporting reads of a fusion (whether made available by
the fusion detection tool or through the Chimera annotation
functions) are assembled with GapFiller into a reference.
The nucleotide sequence of the fusion break point, reconstructed
by chimeraSeqSet, is then checked for inclusion against the de
novo assembled reference. Validation is particularly useful for
the correct evaluation of fusion events supported by few reads
(see Supplementary Material).

3 DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, Chimera is the only available
software able to integrate and compare the data produced by
different fusion detection tools. Thus, it represents an answer
to the lack of standard data structure for fusion data represen-
tation. Furthermore, as the combination of results from more
than one fusion detection tool enhances the probability to iden-
tify fusion events (see Supplementary Material), Chimera pro-
vides a common framework to manipulate, filter and prioritize
fusion events. Moreover Chimera offers a validation procedure
based on de novo assembly (thanks to the GapFiller tool) and
enhances fusions’ annotation through the exploitation of the
Oncofuse results.

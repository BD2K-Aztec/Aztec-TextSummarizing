Abstract

Summary: The Poisson Random Field (PRF) model has become an important tool in population
genetics to study weakly deleterious genetic variation under complicated demographic scenarios.
Currently, there are no freely available software applications that allow simulation of genetic vari—
ation data under this model. Here we present PReFerSim, an ANSI C program that performs
forward simulations underthe PRF model. PReFerSim models changes in population size, arbitrary
amounts of inbreeding, dominance and distributions of selective effects. Users can track summa—
ries of genetic variation over time and output trajectories of selected alleles.

Availability and Implementation: PReFerSim is freely available at: https://github.com/LohmuelIerLab/

1 Introduction

Understanding the behavior of selected mutations in finite popula-
tions is important in population, medical and conservation genetics.
Two main computational approaches have been used to model
weakly deleterious mutations. First, under the Poisson Random
Field (PRF) framework (Hartl et (11., 1994; Sawyer and Hartl, 1992),
a Poisson number of independent mutations enter the population
each generation, with subsequent changes in allele frequency due to
selection and drift. The PRF framework is a mainstay in population
genetic inference of demography and selection (Akashi and
Schaeffer, 1997; Boyko et (11., 2008; Bustamante et (11., 2001; Desai
and Plotkin, 2008; Eyre—Walker et (11., 2006; Gutenkunst et (11.,
2009; Huerta—Sanchez et (11., 2008; Williamson et (11., 2005).
However, existing implementations of the PRF model do not pro-
vide the ages or selection coefficients of individual mutations or per-
mit the user to follow allele frequency trajectories over time.

Moreover, including biological complications, like inbreeding at cer-
tain time points, or dominance effects, are difficult for the average
user within existing software (Boyko et (11., 2008; Gutenkunst et (11.,
2009)

The second approach involves simulation of entire populations
forward in time. Here, individuals reproduce each generation in pro-
portion to their fitness. Several software programs exist to perform
such simulations, including SFSiCODE (Hernandez, 2008), SLiM
(Messer, 2013) and fwdpp (Thornton, 2014). These programs are
designed to simulate large regions of genetic variation with linkage
and arbitrary recombination and they track chromosomal regions
through time, rather than the behavior of individual mutations.
Thus, unless the recombination rate is exceptionally large, they
are not directly comparable to the PRF model which assumes free
recombination. Further, these simulations may not be ideal for gen-
erating trajectories of selected alleles because the trajectories of

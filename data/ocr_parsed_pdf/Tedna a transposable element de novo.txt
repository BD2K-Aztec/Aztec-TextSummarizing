LTRs are slightly too short, and the low complexity region is not
accurately assembled. The three tools needed < l min to produce
the assembly. RepeatExplorer produced an internal error, prob—
ably because it expects more reads. This shows that a transpos—
able element can be reconstructed from its copies with a de
Bruijn graph on the most frequent k—mers.

We then tested Tedna by assembling sequence data generated
for the wheat genome, 90% of which is composed of repetitive
elements. We used the unassembled reads (size 2 x 100 bp)
produced by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing
Consortium for wheat chromosome arm 3AL (unpublished
data) and a manually curated library of 335 wheat transposable
elements (J osquin Daron, submitted for publication). We ﬁnally
compared Tedna on an Arabidopsis thaliana resequencing pro—
ject, available from the Sequence Read Archive under code
SRR616966, which contains 2 x 100 paired—end reads and an
insert size of 500 bp. We used the A.thaliana RepBase data
(J urka et al., 2005) as reference, which contains 390 transposable
elements.

For the two latter datasets, we gave the number of putative
transposable elements given by each tool, as well as their sensi—
tivity and speciﬁcity in Table 1. For each reference transposable
element, we computed the size of the longest predicted fragment
and expressed it as a ratio of the reference transposable element
size (100% would be a predicted full—length element). The aver—
age ratio size is given in the last column. The wheat dataset
shows that Tedna has the best sensitivity and a good speciﬁcity
(although not as good as RepeatExplorer). When ranked by size
of fragments, Tedna is the second best. Oases performs well be—
cause it also contains dedicated algorithms for merging contigs
into full—length transcripts, and it handles read coverage better
than Velvet (which expects uniform coverage). The A.thaliana
dataset is clearly favorable to Oases, which gives almost every—
where the best results. The only exception is the fragment size,
where Velvet performs better. This is a usual trade—off between
speciﬁcity, which is low for Velvet, and accuracy. These results
suggest that Tedna performs better when used on genomes with
high transposable element density, which is observed in most of
higher eukaryotes.

We then detailed the results given by Tedna for each major
transposable element class of A thaliana (see Supplementary
Table). Results vary greatly, and there is no clear reason as to

why the DNA transposons are better assembled than other elem—
ents. Up to now, Tedna only assembles repeated sequences and
cannot discriminate transposable elements. In the A.thaliana
dataset, we located the sequences assembled by Tedna that did
not match the RepBase sequences. Among them, we had 1618
matches in genes. Most map to protein of unknown function;
some of them could be misannotated transposable elements. The
other fragments map to known duplicated genes (Agamous—like
proteins, cellulose synthase, expansins, etc.). A total of 305 frag—
ments map to inserted copies and have been thus missed in our
classiﬁcation protocol, most likely because they signiﬁcantly
diverged from the consensus. A total of 26 fragments mapped
the gypsy element, 19 MuDR and 16 copia.

In a future version, we would like to provide an annotation of
the output of Tedna, as RepeatExplorer does, that would classify
transposable elements and possibly discriminate genes or other
repeated elements.

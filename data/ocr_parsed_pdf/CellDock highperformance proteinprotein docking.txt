ABSTRACT

Summary: The application of docking to large-scale experiments or
the explicit treatment of protein flexibility are part of the new chal-
lenges in structural bioinformatics that will require large computer re-
sources and more efficient algorithms. Highly optimized fast Fourier
transform (FFT) approaches are broadly used in docking programs but
their optimal code implementation leaves hardware acceleration as
the only option to significantly reduce the computational cost of
these tools. In this work we present Cell-Dock, an FFT-based docking
algorithm adapted to the Cell BE processor. We show that Cell-Dock
runs faster than FTDock with maximum speedups of above 200x,
while achieving results of similar quality.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cell functions rely on intricate networks of proteiniprotein inter-
actions, which need to be understood at structural and functional
level. Given the magnitude of the human interactome, experi-
mental efforts will have to be complemented by computational
approaches such as proteiniprotein docking, which aims to pre-
dict the structure of complexes from the free unbound subunits
(Ritchie, 2008). Fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based docking
approaches revolutionized the ﬁeld (Katchalski-Katzir et al.,
1992), but faster computer solutions are required in order to
face some of the current docking challenges, some of which
have arisen from the recent Critical Assessment of Prediction
of Interactions (CAPRI) experiments (Lensink and Wodak,
2010), such as protein ﬂexibility (Griinberg et al., 2004; Smith
et al., 2005), large-scale experiments (Mosca et al., 2009; Wass
et al., 2011) or multi-protein docking (Karaca et al., 2011). Given
that FFT implementations are highly optimized, it is not likely to
speed up this type of calculations by using only algorithm

optimization techniques, leaving hardware acceleration as the
most feasible option to significantly reduce the computational
cost of these tools (Ritchie and Venkatraman, 2010; Sukhwani
and Herbordt, 2009). In this work we present Cell-Dock, to our
knowledge the first protein docking algorithm implemented on
the Cell BE processor (Kahle et al., 2005).

2 CELL-DOCK: A VARIABLE GRID RESOLUTION
FFT-BASED DOCKING ALGORITHM

2.1 Optimization of FF T parameters

Cell-Dock is a ﬁrst-stage rigid-body docking program that gen-
erates docking candidates performing a global scan of the trans-
lational and rotational space of two molecules based on surface
complementarity and electrostatics. It implements the
Katchalski-Katzir algorithm (Katchalski-Katzir et al., 1992), dis-
cretizing both receptor and ligand onto 3D grids and using the
FFT to speed up the translational search for each given rotation.
We based most of our parameters on those of FTDock (Gabb
et al., 1997). A paramount difference is the fixed value used here
for the grid size in number of cells (GRID_SIZE), which is
related to the grid cell resolution (CELL_RES) and total span
(TOTAL_SPAN) in Angstroms by:

CELL_RES = TOTAL_SPAN/GRID_SIZE (1)

TOTAL_SPAN = 1.0 + 2 - radius(rec) + 2 - radius(lig) (2)

For the sake of efﬁciency, GRID_SIZE was forced here to be
a power of two (that is in practice, 128 or 256; these two versions
are identiﬁed from now on as CELL-128 and CELL-256, re-
spectively), given that FFT arrays of that length can be usually
processed much faster (otherwise FFT performance would
depend on the factorization of the array size and the FFT algo-
rithm used). This modification has a direct impact on the
CELL_RES parameter, which now is automatically deﬁned by
the size of the proteins. As in a realistic docking scenario, we
forced CELL_RES to be in the range of 0.74.3  Actually,
CELL_RES values above 1.3A were incompatible with other
parameters in our approach, as well as in FTDock, therefore
some of the largest cases could not be run in CELL-128.

High-performance protein-protein docking

 

2.2 Parallel implementation for HPC architectures

We have parallelized Cell-Dock on a PlayStation 3 (PS3)
with one Cell BE processor and on a Cell BE Blade (i.e.
two Cell BE processors). Parallelization on both architectures
was exploited at both task and data level, with the following
major features (Fig. 1): (i) the main rotation loop of the docking
algorithm was run in parallel on the two Cell BEs of the Cell BE
Blade (sequentially in the case of PS3); (ii) 3D-FFT and grid dis-
cretization of the mobile protein have been parallelized on the
8 Synergistic Processor Elements (SPEsFaccelerators of a Cell
BE (6 SPEs in the case of PS3); (iii) double buffering techniques
have been used in order to overlap memory accesses and compu-
tation on the SPEs; (iv) data locality policies have been used in
order to reduce the amount of data movement between different
processors and (V) single instruction multiple data have been used
on the PowerPC Processor Element (PPE) running the operating
system and SPE codes, as well as dual-threaded processing on the
PPE. All those parallelization strategies, together with the vari-
able grid resolution feature of the algorithm, have provided us
with a high-performance docking application that can be success-
fully applied to HPC architectures.

3 SUCCESSFUL PREDICTION OF
PROTEIN—PROTEIN COMPLEXES

3.1 Evaluation of docking results

In order to check whether predictive results were similar to other
approaches, we tested Cell-Dock on the unbound structures of
the proteiniprotein docking benchmark 2.0 (Supplementary
Table S1), formed by 84 cases (Mintseris et al., 2005). For con-
sistency, all success rates were shown here on the 71 cases in
which we could run both Cell-Dock versions (see Section 2.1).
Given that Cell-Dock used a different grid resolution in each case
[CELL_RES; see Equation (1)], we evaluated the consequences
of that variable on the quality of the predictive results. First, the
method generated a pool of 10000 docking poses for each case
(as in FTDock), which contained near-native (NN) docking

solutions (i.e. RMSDLIG<10A with respect to the reference)
in 89% of the cases when using CELL-256 and in 85% of the
cases when using CELL-128. The results are comparable to those
of FTDock (Pons et al., 2010) as shown in Supplementary Table
S2. We have also assessed the results of scoring the Cell-Dock
docking poses by pyDock (Cheng et al., 2007), based on electro-
statics, desolvation and van der Waals energy. The scoring by
pyDock showed slightly better success rate with CELL-256
(19.7% cases with NN within the top 10 scoring solutions)
than with CELL-128 (18.3% top 10 success rate), probably
due to grid resolution. Indeed, cases with larger resolution in
CELL-128 showed slightly worse results than in CELL-256 (in
which almost all of the cases had 0.7A resolution;
Supplementary Table S1). In any case, these differences were
minimal and the general values were similar to those achieved
by pyDock when scoring FTDock models (Pons et al., 2010), as
shown in Supplementary Table S2.

3.2 Speedup

The execution times for the 84 benchmark cases with CELL-256
ranged from 45 to 64 min (average time: 48.3 min), on a dual
processor Cell BE based blade, which contained two
SMT-enabled Cell BE processors at 3.2 GHz with 2 GB DD2.0
XDR RAM (1 GB per processor). In the case of CELL-128,
execution times ranged from 3.1 to 4.8 min for the 71 cases in
which we could apply this version as above mentioned (average
time: 3.73 min). The different performance of these two versions
(Supplementary Table S1) can be explained by the increase of
data and operations (8x more) in CELL-256 and by the fact that
one full plane (128 x 128) of the grid (1283) in CELL-128 com-
pletely fits in the local memory of a SPE, reducing the commu-
nication requirements for the algorithm with respect to
CELL-256. For comparison, we ran FTDock on JS21 blades
with 8GB of RAM memory, using only one of the four IBM
PowerPC 970MP processors at 2.3 GHz. CELL-256 and
CELL-128 achieved speedups of 24.5 and 226.5, respectively,
when compared to FTDock at the default 0.7A resolution.
However, given that the average grid resolution in CELL-128
was around 1.0A, it seems more appropriate to compare it
with FTDock at 1.0A resolution, in which case the speedup
achieved was 60.8. We should note that the observed speedups
are not due to the difference in clock speed between 2.3 GHz in
PPC and 3.2GHz in Cell BE (which at most would give a the-
oretical speedup of 1.4 for FTDock on the PPC970) but to the
speciﬁc features of the Cell BE and the efﬁcient implementation
of Cell-Dock.

Cell-Dock was also run on a PlayStation 3 using four of its six
SPEs, showing the same predictive results. Executions on a
dual-processor Cell BE-based blade (running 8 SPEs each)
were 3.8 times faster than on PS3 (one Cell BE with 4 SPEs),
which is directly related to the number of processing elements.

4 CONCLUSION

Cell-Dock is a new FFT-based docking implementation for the
Cell BE architecture, showing similar prediction rates to
FTDock, with much more efficient performance. This implemen-
tation can efﬁciently run on the widely accessible PlayStation 3,
opening the door to large-scale experiments that may benefit

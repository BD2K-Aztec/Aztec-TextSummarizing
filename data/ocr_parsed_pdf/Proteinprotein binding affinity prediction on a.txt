ABSTRACT

Motivation: Accurate binding free energy functions for protein—
protein interactions are imperative for a wide range of purposes.
Their construction is predicated upon ascertaining the factors that
influence binding and their relative importance. A recent benchmark
of binding affinities has allowed, for the first time, the evaluation and
construction of binding free energy models using a diverse set of
complexes, and a systematic assessment of our ability to model the
energetics of conformational changes.

Results: We construct a large set of molecular descriptors using
commonly available tools, introducing the use of energetic factors
associated with conformational changes and disorder to order
transitions, as well as features calculated on structural ensembles.
The descriptors are used to train and test a binding free energy
model using a consensus of four machine learning algorithms,
whose performance constitutes a significant improvement over the
other state of the art empirical free energy functions tested. The
internal workings of the learners show how the descriptors are used,
illuminating the determinants of protein—protein binding.
Availability: The molecular descriptor set and descriptor values
for all complexes are available in the Supplementary Material.

and unbound structures can be accessed from the website:

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions are involved in almost all biological
processes, and the structural and thermodynamic characterization of
protein interaction networks is a major goal of functional genomics.
As progress is made in the structural annotation of interaction
networks (Huang et (11., 2008; Kundrotas et (11., 2010; Zhang
et (11., 2010), determining binding free energies is recognized as
an important step in the modelling of biological systems (Aloy
and Russell, 2006; Beltrao et (11., 2007; Dell’Orco, 2009; Keskin
et (11., 2005; Kiel et (11., 2008). The calculation of protein—protein
binding afﬁnities is also fundamental to many endeavours in
structural bioinformatics, ranging from the discovery of peptide

therapeutics (Kumar et (11., 2010; Rao and Kumar, 2008) and
docking (Halperin et (11., 2002) to protein engineering (Kortemme
and Baker, 2004; Sharabi et (11., 2011), de novo interface design
(Fleishman et (11., 2011b) and computational mutagenesis (Ben-
Shimon and Eisenstein, 2010). Understanding the determinants of
protein binding is thus a question of huge practical relevance, and the
construction of accurate and efﬁcient binding free energy functions
of great importance.

Methods of calculating protein—protein binding free energies vary
dramatically from one another in terms of physical plausibility,
accuracy and computational cost. At one end of the spectrum lies
exact methods, such as free energy perturbation and thermodynamic
integration (Kollman, 1993), and end-point methods, such as
MM-PBSA and linear interaction analysis (Gilson and Zhou, 2007).
While in principle highly accurate, these methods use extensive
molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo sampling, and are usually only
applicable where the bound and unbound states have signiﬁcant
overlap. Thus, they can only be applied to proteins for which
conformational changes are minimal and are only practical on a
case by case basis or for low-throughput studies. Empirical energy
functions are much faster, and fall into three categories. The ﬁrst
of these are statistical potentials, in which the relative positions
of atoms or residues observed in experimental structures are used
to infer a potential of mean force (Jiang et (11., 2002; Liu et (11.,
2004; Su et (11., 2009; Zhang et (11., 1997, 2005). Second are
thermodynamic equations, in which the energy is calculated as a
sum of terms arising from relevant phenomena (Bai et (11., 2011;
Bougouffa and Warwicker, 2008; Horton and Lewis, 1992; Krystek
et (11., 1993; Ma et (11., 2002; Novotny et (11., 1989; Vajda et (11.,
1994; Weng et (11., 1997; Xu et (11., 1997). The relative contributions
of the terms can be determined by linear regression against known
binding afﬁnities (Bai et (11., 2011; Bougouffa and Warwicker, 2008;
Horton and Lewis, 1992; Ma et (11., 2002; Xu et (11., 1997), or
by other other means (Krystek et (11., 1993; Novotny et (11., 1989;
Vajda et (11., 1994; Weng et (11., 1997). Third, there are functions
which implicitly estimate binding free energies due to their being
optimized for purposes such as docking, estimating free energy
differences between mutants (Jiang et (11., 2005) or identifying
biological assemblies (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007).

Most previous binding free energy models have been
parametrized and/or evaluated on a narrow range of proteins.
Flexible proteins were either explicitly rejected or implicitly under-
represented due to datasets being derived from previous works.
Further, the complexes comprised either exclusively of protease—
inhibitor pairs (Krystek et (11., 1993; Nauchitel et (11., 1995; Vajda
et (11., 1994; Wallqvist et (11., 1995; Zhang et (11., 1997) or mostly
protease inhibitor interactions with a few others, such as the insulin

dimer, barnase—barstar, lysozme—antibody and the (113 interface
of deoxyhaemoglobin (Audie and Scarlata, 2007; Bougouffa and
Warwicker, 2008; Horton and Lewis, 1992; Jiang et (11., 2002; Ma
et (11., 2002; Weng et (11., 1997; Xu et (11., 1997; Zhou and Zhou,
2002). Four recent studies have been undertaken on much larger
datasets of between 52 and 86 complexes (Jiang et (11., 2005; Liu
et (11., 2004; Su et (11., 2009; Zhang et (11., 2005). Most of the
additional interactions were of small peptides, typically between
2 and 5 residues in length, and mostly interacting with oligopeptide
binding protein OppA. Although still biased towards small rigid
proteins, some other complexes, such as hormone—receptor pairs,
signal transduction complexes and complexes containing G proteins,
were also considered. More recently, empirical free energy models
of all three categories were evaluated on a more diverse set of 46
interactions (Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010). The best correlations with
experimental afﬁnities were around 0.5, and no method stood out as
being particularly superior.

We recently published the largest and most diverse set of
experimental binding free energies to date, covering 144 non-
redundant interactions, with structural cross-referencing to both the
bound complex and its unbound constituents (Kastritis et (11., 2011).
This provides an unprecedented opportunity for the construction and
evaluation of empirical binding free energies models.

2 APPROACH

Machine learning has been successfully applied to hot-spot
identiﬁcations (Cho et (11., 2009; Darnell et (11., 2007; Tuncbag et (11.,
2010; Zhu and Mitchell, 2011), but to the authors’ knowledge has
not yet been used for protein—protein binding afﬁnity prediction. The
approach taken here is to construct a set of molecular descriptors
and feed these into machine learning models. The learners are
trained on a subset of the benchmark for which binding afﬁnities
are known with high conﬁdence. These models are combined to
produce a consensus energy, which is veriﬁed using leave-one-out
cross-validation and the remainder of the benchmark. As a wide
range of conformational changes are observed within the dataset,
and previous empirical binding free energy functions have largely
neglected these, a number of descriptors are included to model
the energetics of structural rearrangements, including bonding and
non-bonding terms.

The descriptors are chosen foremost for their physical relevance.
Most are explicitly designed to either model the free energy, enthalpy
or entropy changes associated with the processes shown in Figure 1.
Computational efﬁciency was considered and most descriptors can
be calculated within seconds using simple equations, common
packages and publicly available web servers. Efﬁcient algorithms

are used where applicable, such as the elastic network vibrational
entropy model and the conformational space sampling routine,
both of which perform well despite requiring a fraction of the
computational resources compared with more traditional techniques
(Benedix et (11., 2009; Carrington and Mancera, 2004).

A wide variety of machine learning tools are available, and
their performance is highly dependent on the problem they are
applied to. Four learners were selected which are speciﬁcally
aimed at continuous class regression; Random Forest (RF, Breiman,
2001), M5’ Regression Tree (M5’, Wang and Witten, 1997),
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS, Friedman, 1991)
and Radial Basis Function Interpolation (RBF, Hardy, 1971).
The choice of these learners was guided by the following
considerations:

(1) As linear regression has been routinely applied to protein—
protein afﬁnity prediction, methods were chosen which
address some of its limitations; sensitivity to outliers, inability
to account for non-linear relationships and degradation in
performance in high dimensions. Acknowledging that certain
molecular descriptors might be noisy within certain ranges,
algorithms which are able to partition the input space may be
better suited to this problem.

(2) The methods have differing conceptual attributes. The RF,
for instance, is derived from the consensus of many low-
accuracy models. The MARS method allows the exploitation
of parameters which have predictive value only over certain
ranges. The M5’ method works by applying different
regression models to different parts of the input space, which
accounts for diversity within the dataset. The RBF method
exploits global features of the training set, and the predicted
afﬁnity of any given case is largely determined by examples
further away in feature space. These different approaches
were considered likely to capture different aspects of the
descriptor set, ideally having weak correlations between their
predictions and hence more likely to work synergistically
when combined together into a consensus model. We
acknowledge that learner selection and fusion algorithms
are available and might offer more attractive solutions
(Kuncheva, 2002; Opitz and Maclin, 1999). However, such
methods are prone to overﬁtting unless a further validation set
is used. Given our limited sized dataset, we opted for a simple
unweighted average of the outputs of predictors chosen for
their conceptual differences.

(3) The models can be scrutinized, allowing their physical
plausibility to be evaluated and the relative contributions of
the various factors to be ascertained.

(4) Methods must be able to avoid ﬁtting noise in the data while
still detecting the signal. The techniques chosen account for
overﬁtting either explicitly or implicitly. RFs do not overﬁt
as more trees are added, rather the test error converges to a
limiting value. They are able to achieve low bias predictions
through trees built from different subsets of the data and
descriptors, and low variance through averaging the output
of all trees. The M5’ and MARS methods have backward
feature elimination routines to remove redundant features. In
the RBF method, features are equally weighted and it is the
contributions of the examples in the training set which are

determined. This is particularly suited to situations in which
there are more features than examples as is the case here.

(5) The methods are robust to the model parameters. As
ﬁne-tuning is not required, default parameters can be
used, eliminating possible biases originating from adjusting
parameters until the desired result is obtained.

3 METHODS
3.1 The Descriptors

In total, 200 descriptors were calculated, which are described fully in
Supplementary File S1. Although some were calculated using stand-alone
programs or simple equations, most were calculated using the ProtorP
server (Reynolds at 611., 2009), CHARMM (Brooks at 611., 2009), PyRosetta
(Chaudhury at 611., 2010), FireDock (Andrusier at 611., 2007) and the
Potentials’R’Us server (Feng at 611., 2010). These include energy terms
associated with electrostatics, London dispersion and exchange repulsion
forces, as well as potentials for hydrogen bond, aliphatic, CﬂtiOIliJT and
71771 interactions. Also included are descriptors related to solvation effects,
including continuum electrostatics models and hydrophobic burial, as well
as terms for translational, rotational, Vibrational, side chain and disorder to
order transition entropies. Additionally, a number of statistical potentials,
including residue and atomic pair potentials, as well as four-body potentials,
were included. Rigid body interaction energy changes were calculated as

Ebind = Ecomplex — (ER,b +EL,b)- (1)

The descriptors that account for conformational changes upon binding,
which carry the sufﬁx UB or EBU, were calculated using the energy of the
proteins in the absence of their binding partners as

EUR—>8 =(ER,b—ER,11)+(EL,12 —EL,I1)- (2)

As pH can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on binding afﬁnity, even over
a narrow range, some descriptors were chosen for their ability to account
for variable protonation states. First, PROPKA was used to determine the
pKa of the titratable amino acids (Bas at 611., 2008). The most probable
assignment of protonation states, at the experimental pH, was determined
using PDB2PQR (Dolinsky at 611., 2007). These assignments were used in all
descriptors calculated using the CHARMM22 force ﬁeld, which are preﬁxed
with ACE22.

Lastly, as proteins exist not as static structures but as structural ensembles,
conformational sampling was performed with CONCOORD 2.1 using
dynamic tolerance setting (de Groot at 611., 1997). For the unbound
receptor, unbound ligand and bound complex, 100 structures were generated
and energies calculated by averaging over the structural ensembles. The
corresponding descriptors for rigid body binding and conformational changes
are denoted by the sufﬁxes ENS and EBU, respectively.

3.2 The Learners

MARS: it is a non-parametric regression method which uses a set of hinge
functions to model non-linear relationships between the input variables and
the target output (Friedman, 1991). The model is formed from a set of
weighted basis functions, where each basis function contains a hinge function
or a product of two or more hinge functions, if we seek to model higher order
interactions between variables. MARS automatically assigns the weights for
each basis function, and the variables for a given hinge function together
with the values for the knot positions.

i2]

Default values were used without tuning, as follows: we set a maximum
limit on the number of basis functions grown in the forward phase to 21, and

set no limit on the number of basis functions used in the ﬁnal model after
pruning. Model complexity is also limited by setting the knot-cost to the
recommended value of two. Piece-wise cubic modelling was use to model
hinge regions, no self-interactions between input variables was allowed and
no interactions between variables was allowed in the basis functions, as we
found that this additional complexity was not needed. The ARESLab toolbox
implementation was used.

Random forest: a Matlab implementation of the RF algorithm, as described
by Breiman (2001), was used. RF is an average prediction of a collection of
decision trees, where the criterion at each node is chosen so as to minimize the
variance within the branches. For an effective ensemble, the tree predictions
should have high accuracy but low correlation across trees. RF achieves the
latter by building each decision tree using only a subset of features and data
from the full respective sets. In our implementation, the number of decision
trees was set to 750 and we limit the number of random features available for
selection at each node when building the decision trees to 20. Each decision
tree was fully grown, such that each leaf corresponds to a member of the
training set. The ﬁnal prediction is returned as the mean of all trees. The RF
prediction was found to be very robust to change in these parameters and
ﬁne-tuning was not required.

RBF interpolation: the RBF method was used, as described by Hardy (1971),
in a Matlab implementation. The energy function consists of the mean afﬁnity
of the training set, 11, plus a linear combination of multiquadratic basis
functions, ¢(d) = x/a'2 + 1, summed across the n cases in the training set.

where x is the descriptor vector. The a regression coefﬁcients are determined
by multiple regression. Equation (4) is used for the prediction and requires no
parameters other than the training data. In this intriguing model, all features
are equally weighted, and it is the weights of the cases in the training set
which are optimized.
M5’ : the M5 model tree is similar to standard regression trees with the
additional possibility of having a linear regression model at the leaves
(Quinlan, 1992). The tree is fully grown, and then pruned by a greedy
algorithm using error estimates. In the pruning stage, consideration is given
to adding a regression model instead of a constant value prediction. In this
work, we make use of the M5’ algorithm, a modiﬁed version of the original
M5 regression tree described by Wang and Witten (1997). This version is able
to achieve more comprehensible trees through smaller trees which still have
similar predictive performance. Each tree is descended to either a constant
value prediction or a regression plane. Rather than applying one M5’ to the
full feature set, an ensemble of M5’ regression trees was used; four sets of
four M5’ regression trees each, where each set covers the whole feature set
space and each M5’ tree within each set covers a unique feature subset. The
predicted value of all 16 trees is averaged for the ﬁnal prediction, as for
the RF method. Default values were used, and not tuned, as follows: for
each M5’ tree we limited the number of examples a node can represent to a
minimum of four. A node is not split if the SD of the output variable values at
the node is <0.05 of the SD of the output variable values of the entire original
dataset. Smoothing was not enabled as we found no signiﬁcant changes in
performance when applied. The M5PrimeLab toolbox implementation was
used.

3.3 Dataset

The descriptor set was calculated on 137 of the 144 complexes described in
Kastritis et a1. (2011). Of the omitted complexes, 1UUG, llQD and 1NSN
were removed as only upper limits to their afﬁnity were available, and 1DE4,
1M10, 1NCA and 1NB5 due to difﬁculties deriving a full feature set. All post-
translational modiﬁcations were reverted back to their precursor amino acids.
The descriptor and afﬁnities values were normalized in the range [0.1], and
are given in Supplementary Table S2. The 73 rigid complexes are deﬁned as
those with an interface C0, RMSD <1 A, and the remaining 64 are classiﬁed
as ﬂexible.

Protein-protein binding affinity prediction

 

As the dataset is derived from the docking benchmark 4.0, redundancy is
alleviated at the protein family level as described in Hwang et a1. (2010)
for all but nine pairs of complexes. This ensures that the leave-one-out
cross-validation scheme does not overestimate predictive ability by having
a homologous complex of similar afﬁnity in the training set. Brieﬂy, if two
proteins in one complex are in the same SCOP family (Murzin at 611., 1995)
as two proteins in another, then these are deemed redundant and are not
included in the dataset. The remaining nine pairs of homologous complexes
are cognate/non-cognate pairs, of similar sequence but with large difference
in binding afﬁnity, and thus are not a source of repeat example bias (Kastritis
at 611., 2011).

A subset of 57 complexes, called the validated set, was used to train the
learners. These complexes, which appears in Supplementary File S3, are
those whose binding afﬁnities are deemed to be high conﬁdence. They were
selected on the basis that either their binding afﬁnity has been measured by
more than one group / experimental technique and that the two values are
within 2 kcal/mol of each other or that their value is corroborated by another
measure such as a Michaelis constant. The validated set contains 29 ﬂexible
complexes and retains the diversity of the complete benchmark, consisting of
3 antibody/antigen complexes, 16 enzymeiinhibitor complexes, 5 enzymei
substrate complexes, 5 other complexes with enzymes, 8 complexes
containing G-proteins, 7 receptoriligand complexes and 13 miscellaneous
complexes.

3.4 Method validation and comparison

All correlations are reported as the Pearson’s productimoment correlation
coefﬁcient, calculated as the covariance of the two variables divided by
the product of their SD. This parametric measure of correlation assesses
the strength of linear dependence between two variables and is a widely
accepted metric of the relationship between predicted and experimental
binding afﬁnities (Ferrara at 611., 2004; Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010; Kim
and Skolnick, 2008; Marsden at 611., 2004; So and Karplus, 1999; Warren
at 611., 2006).

The predictions used for calculating all correlations and P-Values are
those derived from leave-one-out cross-validation for the interactions in
the validated set, where cross-validation is the outermost loop. Multiple
training/validation runs showed high consistency in terms of feature usage
and prediction accuracy. For the blind test set consisting of the 80 interactions
not in the validated set, the predictions are calculated using the learners
trained on the whole of the validated set. Results for the whole dataset
are the unison of these predictions and the leave-one-out cross-validation
predictions for the validated set. As the four learners either have no adjustable
parameters other than those found in the training phase or these parameters
are kept ﬁxed at default without adjustment, all predictions are a blind test.
The learners were combined to form a consensus model. The consensus
model predictions were calculated simply as the arithmetic mean of the leave-
one-out cross-validation predictions and thus also constitute a blind test.
Model performance is reported as the correlation between the leave-one-out
cross-validation predictions and the experimental binding free energies. The
P-Values for correlation signiﬁcance were derived for the four learners and
the consensus model over the validated set, the whole set, the intersections
of these with the ﬂexible set and rigid set, as well at the intersections of the
validated and whole sets with the dataset of Kastritis and Bonvin (2010).
We found P<0.01 for all cases and these are not further reported in the
results. When comparing the correlation between the predictions for the four
learners, leave-one-out cross-validation results are used.

For comparison, free energy predictions were also calculated using
DComplex (Liu at 611., 2004) and the pair potential described by Su et a1.
(2009). Using the whole dataset, the distribution of residuals around the
correlation was assessed for the consensus model and the two pair potentials;
using a Shapir07Wilk test, no strong evidence (P <0.05) could be found
against a normal distribution for any of these. One-tailed P-Values for
comparing the correlations of two sets of predictions, with null hypothesis
that the same correlation strength is shown by both samples of pairs

(Papoulis, 1990), were obtained by transforming the correlation coefﬁcients
using the Fisher r to z transformation and ﬁnding the difference as

Z] —Z2

z = —l l . (5)
y m + m

The P-Values for comparing the absolute and square errors of two models
were obtained using the one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Additionally,
predictions for the 11 other scoring functions tested by Kastritis and
Bonvin (2010) were obtained for the intersection of the datasets. These are
the ROSETTA standard and interface energy scores (Gray at 611., 2003),
AfﬁnityScore (Audie and Scarlata, 2007), HADDOCK (de Vries at 611.,
2007), FastContact (Camacho and Zhang, 2005), FireDock (Andrusier at 611.,
2007), PyDock (Cheng at 611., 2007), ZRANK (Pierce and Weng, 2007),
ATTRACT (May and Zacharias, 2008) and the PISA entropy and free energy
scores (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). Although the overlap with the current
dataset (37) is quite small, inspection of residuals after regression of these
data against the experimental afﬁnities showed few outliers and no major

deviations from Gaussian.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The learners were trained and tested using the 57 complexes in
the validated set and leave-one-out cross-validation. The results are
shown in Figure 2. All the algorithms had correlations between 0.68
and 0.75 against the experimental data. The correlations between
the predictions was evaluated; whilE the predictions of the RF
and M5’ methods were correlated with the RBF method (r=0.87
and r=0.86, respectively), and highly correlated with each other
(r=0.95), the MARS model was less correlated with the RBF, RF
and M5’ methods (r=0.65, r=0.69 and r=0.68, respectively).
This suggested that the models may be detecting different aspects
of the descriptor set, and a consensus model was built in which
the predicted afﬁnity was the mean output of the four models.
This model has a correlation of 0.77 with the experimental afﬁnity,
which is signiﬁcantly higher than the potentials of Su et (11. (2009)
(PMF, r=0.51, P<0.01) and Liu et (11. (2004) (DFIRE, r=0.44,
P <0.01). The consensus model also performs signiﬁcantly better
in terms of lower absolute error (PPMF <0.01, PDFIRE <0.01)
and square error (PpMF < 0.01, PDFIRE < 0.01). The methods were
also evaluated on the 80 complexes from the non-validated set.
These predictions were amalgamated with the leave-one-out cross-
validated predictions for the validated set, to cover all 137 complexes

in the benchmark. The correlation between these predictions and
the experimental data is shown in Figure 3. A large drop in
predictive power is observed relative to the results for the validated
set, despite having a similar proportion of non-rigid cases and
interaction types. This highlights the importance of validating data
with multiple experiments using different setups and techniques;
sometimes different authors give widely varying afﬁnities for the
same complex, such as the interaction between ubiquitin and UCH-
L3, for which Hirayama et (11. (2007) report an afﬁnity of tens
of nanomolar, while Reyes-Turcu and Wilkinson (2009) claim the
afﬁnity is in the range of hundreds of micromolar. Nevertheless,
the consensus model still performed better than PMF and DFIRE
in terms of correlation (PpMF =0.03, PDFIRE =0.02), absolute
error (PpMF < 0.01, PDFIRE < 0.01) and square error (PpMF < 0.01,
PDFIRE<0.01). The correlations for a number of other energy
functions was also evaluated on a subset of the benchmark, as shown
in Figure 4. The consensus model outperformed all methods tested.

4.1 The Learners

Upon RBF regression, the linear combination ﬁts the data
tightly with a correlation of 0.99 and when leave-one-out cross-
validated, the model produces a correlation of 0.75. The coefﬁcient
distribution, which appears in Supplementary File S4, is as expected,
with the highest afﬁnity interactions destabilizing complexes far in
feature space and vice versa. There are, however, a few exceptions,
such as 1ROR which has a stabilizing effect on the complexes distant
from it despite having high afﬁnity, and 200B and 1AK4, which
have very low afﬁnity yet have low regression coefﬁcients.

The RF method was constructed and tested, resulting in a leave-
one-out cross-validated correlation of 0.70. For each complex, the
ﬁve most relevant features were determined. A feature calculated
using the unbound structure appeared as one of these for 61%
of the ﬂexible complexes, compared with only 17% of the rigid
interactions, showing that the trees are selecting relevant features.
Further, an ensemble descriptor appeared in the top ﬁve for 67%
of the complexes. A descriptor importance measure, the mean
decrease in mean square error upon permutation [as described
by Breiman (2001)], is shown in Supplementary File S5 for the
top 20 descriptors. Most signiﬁcant are the hydrophobic burial
term ACE12_HYDR, the London dispersion term ROS_FA_ATR
and the Van der Waals term ACE22_VDW. Also prominent is the
vibrational entropy change term S_VIB, interface packing term

intersection between the dataset of Kastritis and Bonvin (2010) and the
benchmark (All), and the 14 in the intersection with the validated set

intersect the validated set. Correlations for a number of other energy functions
are also shown (see Section 3.4).

NSC, H-bonding terms and statistical pair potentials, some of which
are calculated using ensembles.

Construction and evaluation of the M5’ regression trees resulted
in a leave-one-out cross-validated correlation of 0.69. The trees,
along with feature usage counts, are shown in Supplementary
File S6. Five of the descriptors were used four times, the maximum
allowed in our scheme; the interface packing score NSC, the London
dispersion energy ROS_FA_ATR, the residue level pair potential
ROS_CG_BETA, the atomistic pair potential OPUS_PSP_ENS
calculated over structural ensembles and ACE_19_COUL_UB, the
Coulombic energy change due to conformational rearrangement.
Descriptors selected three times include other statistical pair
potentials and H-bonding terms.

Using leave-one-out cross-validation, the MARS learner predicts
the experimental binding energies with a correlation of 0.68. Trained
on the validated set, the algorithm terminated with 14 basis functions
which use a total of 10 descriptors. The functions and descriptor
importance estimates in the form of function SDs and generalized
cross-validation scores, as described by Friedman (1991), appear
in Supplementary File S7. The most important term according to
both metrics is the London dispersion term ROS_FA_ATR. Its
contribution to the binding free energy is linear over the range
covered by most of the complexes. However, a hinge ﬁinction at
—81.7kcal/mol results in the destabilization of complexes with
dispersion energy below this, such as the outlier 2OZA which
has lower afﬁnity than expected from its large interface due
to disorder to order transitions occurring in a loop and at the
C-terminal region. The second most signiﬁcant descriptor is the
vibrational entropy term S_VIB. At low values, its contribution is
approximately zero, but becomes linear for higher values. This
is consistent with the interpretation that, because this descriptor
is approximate (Carrington and Mancera, 2004), the learner is
choosing to use it when its contribution to the binding energy is
sufﬁcient to outweigh the noise it introduces. The other descriptors
include a desolvation term, statistical pair potentials and H-bonding
potentials for both intermolecular and conformational energy.

Fig. 5. Scatter plot for predicted and experimental afﬁnities. Flexible (green
circles) and rigid (red squares) proteins are shown. Leave-one-out cross-
Validated values for the validated set are highlighted in solid.

4.2 Conformational change

The predictions were evaluated separately for the rigid and ﬂexible
complexes. The predictions for the rigid interactions were highly
accurate (rval =0.90). The RMSE for these complexes in the
validated set is 1.67 kcal/mol, which is within the range of variation
expected due to experimental errors and unaccounted environmental
factors, around 1.4—2.0 kcal/mol (Kastritis et (11., 2011). However,
the correlation for the ﬂexible complexes (rval =0.59) was
signiﬁcantly worse (P<0.01), as is the case with all the other
methods considered here. Nevertheless, the consensus model does
predict the afﬁnities of the ﬂexible complexes with better accuracy
than the PMF and DFIRE methods in terms of both absolute
error (PpMF < 0.01, PDFIRE < 0.01) and square error (PpMF < 0.01,
PDFIRE < 0.01).

The experimental and consensus predictions are shown in Figure 5
and Supplementary ﬁle S8. It is clear from the sparse bottom right-
hand comer of this plot that the consensus model overestimates
binding afﬁnity more frequently than it underestimates, and
that this effect is most pronounced for the ﬂexible cases. This
suggests that even greater accuracy could be achieved with better
modelling of phenomena relating to destabilization associated with
conformational changes, such as entropy changes due to increased
steric hindrance upon binding.

4.3 Descriptor subsets

In order to determine the extent to which the descriptors
relating to ensembles and conformational changes inﬂuence the
predictions, the consensus model was retrained using subsets
of the descriptors and re-evaluated. The ﬁrst descriptor subset
contained all the descriptors that were not calculated using
either information derived from the unbound structures or the
structural ensembles. While still superior to the DFIRE and
PMF predictions, the predictions using only these basic features
(r=0.68, RMSE=2.2kcal/mol) were less accurate than when
all the descriptors were used (r=0.77, RMSE=1.93 kcal/mol).

As expected, most of the drop in accuracy was due to the
ﬂexible cases (r: 0.45, RMSE = 2.59 kcal/mol versus r = 0.59,
RMSE=2.16kcal/mol), rather than the rigid cases (r=0.90,
RMSE = 1.75 kcal/mol versus r: 0.90, RMSE = 1.67 kcal/mol).

When the descriptors relating to the ensembles, except those
relating to the unbound structure, are included in addition to the
basic features, a drop in accuracy is observed (r=0.61, RMSE:
2.51 kcal/mol), both for the rigid (r = 0.82, RMSE = 2.02 kcal/mol)
and ﬂexible (r=0.37, RMSE=2.91kcal/mol) cases, although this
can be mostly attributed to poor performance of the MARS learner.

When the features relating to the unbound structures, except for
those calculated using ensembles, are used in addition to the basic
features, an improvement in performance is observed (r=0.74,
RMSE=2.04 kcal/mol). This is due to the improved predictions
for the ﬂexible complexes (r: 0.47, RMSE = 2.31 kcal/mol), rather
than the rigid complexes (r=0.91, RMSE: 1.72 kcal/mol), which
perform equally well.

A fourth descriptor subset was evaluated which contained only the
basic features and those calculated using both the unbound structures
and ensembles. The performance (r = 0.61, RMSE = 2.08 kcal/mol)
was intermediate between the previous model and the model trained
on all features. Again, this improvement is attributed to the ﬂexible
complexes (r=0.53, RMSE=2.34 kcal/mol) rather than the rigid
ones (r = 0.91, RMSE = 1.76 kcal/mol).

These results, from models trained using descriptor subsets,
show that the inclusion of descriptors derived from the unbound
structures improves the performance for the ﬂexible complexes
without diminishing the accuracy for the rigid complexes. This
improvement is further enhanced when used in combination with
structural ensembles, despite the ensembles not enhancing the
consensus model when information derived from the unbound
structures is omitted.

4.4 Applications and future work

Binding free energy calculations have a number of important
applications in structural bioinformatics. Currently, ‘one function
ﬁts all’ does not apply and energy models need to be parameterized
for purpose (Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010) and a trade-off between
accuracy and computational expense is inevitable. Although these
applications are beyond the scope of the current work, the adaptation
of the presented methods shall be the focus of future research.
Combined with side chain remodelling, energy models can be
used for mutational AAG calculation, for interface engineering or
determining the functional consequences of mutation [e.g. Ben-
Shimon and Eisenstein (2010)]. Interaction potentials are also
central to generating and ranking docked structures (Halperin et (11.,
2002), the rigid body simulation of encounter complex formation
(Elcock et (11., 2001; Li et (11., 2010) and distinguishing biological
assemblies from crystal contacts (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007).
A recent application for which a precursor to the presented model
was used is in the selection of de novo designed interactions
found using the method of Fleishman et (11. (2011b). The energy
function was applied to the selection of reﬁned true interactions
among ostensibly indistinguishable designed interactions. Using an
appropriate energy threshold, it was capable of classifying 207
structures with 88% accuracy, and was further validated in a blind
test by correctly classifying nine designs, eight of which failed to
show binding ﬁinction when tested experimentally and the other

of which did. This work will be published shortly Fleishman et (11.
(201 la).

5 CONCLUSION

The recent publication of a large set of binding free energies has
allowed an unprecedented opportunity to construct and evaluate
predictive energy models. We have derived a large molecular
descriptor set covering many aspects of protein binding including
unbound to bound transitions, desolvation effects and entropy
changes. This descriptor set was used to train and evaluate four
binding free energy models. These models, and their consensus,
can predict binding energies with greater accuracy than previous
empirical functions, even when the ensemble and conformational
descriptors are omitted. For the rigid proteins tested, the consensus
model can predict the afﬁnities to within the accuracy expected from
experimental and environmental uncertainties.

The internal working of the learners also allow the evaluation of
feature importance. This shows that the London dispersion energy,
vibrational entropy, statistical potentials and interface packing terms
have the most predictive value, and that hydrophobic burial and
hydrogen bonding are also important determinants of binding
afﬁnity. Additionally, retraining the models using descriptor subsets
revealed that knowledge of unbound to bound conformational
changes improves the performance of the consensus model, and that
the greatest improvement is attained when energies are averaged
over conformational ensembles.

This work also highlights the importance of using experimental
data validated by multiple experiments, and provides a benchmark
of high-quality afﬁnities for a diverse range of complexes.

Abstract

Summary: Many statistical problems in bioinformatics and genetics can be formulated as the
testing of associations between a categorical variable and a continuous variable. A dynamic slicing
method was proposed for non—parametric dependence testing, which has been demonstrated to
have higher powers compared with traditional methods such as Kolmogorov—Smirnov test.
We introduce an R package dslice to facilitate the use of dynamic slicing method in bioinformatic
applications such as quantitative trait loci study and gene set enrichment analysis.

Availability and implementation: dslice is implemented in chp and available in the
Comprehensive R Archive Network. The package is distributed under the GNU General Public

 

License (version 2 or later).

1 Introduction

Often in biological studies, we need to test whether the underlying
distributions of two or more populations are different from each
other on the basis of independent samples from these populations.
The K-sample test problem is equivalent to testing whether the value
of an observation is independent of its label indicator (i.e. which
sample it comes from). Traditional methods such as the t-test and
the rank-sum test can only test differences in means or medians.
On the other hand, classic omnibus testing methods such as
Kolmogorov—Smirnov test have limited power in detecting differ-
ences between distributions of different types. Jiang et a]. (2014)
proposed an omnibus K-sample testing method based on regularized
likelihood-ratio test and dynamic slicing (here we refer to the test
statistic as ‘DS-statistic’) and demonstrated its statistical power com-
pared with some existing well-known methods through extensive
simulation studies. Here, we introduce an R package dslice that
implements this novel dynamic slicing (‘DS’) method for nonpara-
metric tests and makes it a versatile statistical tool for applications

in quantitative trait loci (QTL) study and gene set enrichment ana-
lysis (GSEA).

2 Implementation

Core functions for testing dependence in dslice are implemented in
the Cpp language and are integrated in R through the chp package
(Eddelbuettel and Francois, 2011). R package dslice contains func-
tions for omnibus K-sample hypothesis testing (dsitest), illustrations
of optimal slicing scheme (sliceislmw) and gene set analysis (dsgszz)
on dataset downloaded from GSEA website (http://www.broadinsti-
tute.org/gsea/index.jsp).

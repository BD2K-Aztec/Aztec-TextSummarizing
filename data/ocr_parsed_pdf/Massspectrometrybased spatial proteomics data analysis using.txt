ABSTRACT

Motivation: Experimental spatial proteomics, i.e. the high-throughput
assignment of proteins to sub-cellular compartments based on quan-
titative proteomics data, promises to shed new light on many biolo-
gical processes given adequate computational tools.

Results: Here we present pRoloc, a complete infrastructure to
support and guide the sound analysis of quantitative mass-
spectrometry-based spatial proteomics data. It provides functionality
for unsupervised and supervised machine learning for data exploration
and protein classification and novelty detection to identify new puta-
tive sub-cellular clusters. The software builds upon existing infrastruc-
ture for data management and data processing.

Availability: pRoloc is implemented in the R language and available
under an open-source license from the Bioconductor project (http://
www.bioconductor.org/). A vignette with a complete tutorial describing
data import/export and analysis is included in the package. Test data
is available in the companion package pRolocdata.

1 INTRODUCTION

Knowledge of the spatial distribution of proteins is of critical
importance to elucidate their role and reﬁne our understanding
of cellular processes. Mis-localization of proteins have been asso-
ciated with cellular dysfunction and disease states (Kau et al.,
2004; Laurila et al., 2009; Park et al., 2011), highlighting the
importance of localization studies. Spatial or organelle prote-
omics is the systematic study of the proteins and their sub-
cellular localization; these compartments can be organelles, i.e.
structures deﬁned by lipid bi-layers, macro-molecular assemblies
of proteins and nucleic acids or large protein complexes. Despite
technological advances in spatial proteomics experimental de-
signs and progress in mass-spectrometry (Gatto et al., 2010),
software support is lacking. To address this, we developed the
pRoloc package that provides a wide range of thoroughly docu-
mented analysis methodologies. The software includes state-
of-the-art statistical machine-learning algorithms and bundles

them in a consistent framework, accommodating any experimen-
tal designs and quantitation strategies.

2 AVAILABLE FUNCTIONALITY

pRoloc makes use of the architecture implemented in the
MSnbase package (Gatto and Lilley, 2012) for data storage,
feature and sample annotation (meta-data) and data processing,
such as scaling, normalization and missing data imputation. We
also distribute 16 annotated datasets in the pRolocdata pack-
age, which are used for illustration of different pipelines as well
as algorithm testing and development. Algorithms for (i) cluster-
ing, (ii) novelty detection and (iii) classiﬁcation are proposed
along with Visualization functionalities.

2.1 Clustering

The unsupervised machine-leaming techniques are used, among
other aims, as exploration and quality control tools. Several crit-
ical factors such as feature-level quantitation values, the extent of
missing values and organelle markers can be overlaid on the data
clusters as effective data exploration and quality control.

2.2 Novelty detection

An essential step for reliable classiﬁcation is the availability of
well-characterized labeled data, termed ‘marker proteins’. These
reliable organelle residents deﬁne the set of observed organelles
and are used to train a classiﬁer. It is however laborious and
extremely difﬁcult to manually deﬁne reliable markers for all
possible sub-cellular structures. As such, any organelles without
any suitable markers will be completely omitted from subsequent
classiﬁcation. pRoloc provides the implementation for the
phenoDisco novelty detection algorithm (Breckels et al., 2013)
that, based on a minimal set of markers and unlabeled data,
can be used to effectively detect new putative clusters in
the data, beyond those that were initially manually described

(Fig. 1).

2.3 Classiﬁcation

Since the development and refinement of spatial proteomics ex-
periments, several classiﬁcation methods have been used: partial
least-square discriminant analysis (Dunkley et al., 2006), SVMs
(Trotter et al., 2010), random forest (Ohta et al., 2010), neural

Fig. 1. Current state-of-the-art experimental organelle proteomics data analysis with pRoloc. On the left, we replicated the original ﬁndings from Tan
et a]. (2009) on Drosophila embryos. On the right, we present results of the same data set obtained with pRoloc, utilizing the novelty discovery
functionality (new color-coded organelles) and a class-weighted support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with classiﬁer posterior probabilities (point

sizes)

networks (Tardif et al., 2012) and naive Bayes (Nikolovski et al.,
2012), all available in pRoloc. In addition, other novel algo-
rithms are proposed, such as PerTurbo (Courty et al., 2011). We
have compared and contrasted these algorithms using reliable
marker sets and demonstrate in the package documentation
that the driving factor for good classiﬁcation is reﬂected in the
intrinsic quality of the data itself, i.e. efficient cellular content
separation, accurate quantitation (Jakobsen et al., 2011), etc.
illustrating the minor importance of the classiﬁcation algorithm
with respect to thorough data exploration and quality control.
While the exact algorithm might not be the major reason for a
good analysis, it is essential to guarantee optimal application of
the algorithm. A central design decision in the development of
the classiﬁcation schema was to explicitly implement model par-
ameter optimization routines to maximize the generalization
power of the results.

3 A TYPICAL PIPELINE

A typical pipeline is summarized below using data from
Arabidopsis thaliana callus (Dunkley et al., 2006). We ﬁrst
load the required packages and example data. The
phenoDisco function is then run to identify new putative clus-
ters that, after validation (the pd. markers feature meta-data),
can be used for the classiﬁcation using the SVM algorithm (with
a Gaussian kernel). The algorithms parameters are ﬁrst
optimized and then subsequently applied in the actual classiﬁ-
cation. Finally, the plot2D function is used to generate an
annotated scatter plot along the two ﬁrst principal components

(Fig. 1).

4 CONCLUSIONS

The need for statistically sound proteomics data analysis has
spawned interest in the proteomics community (Gatto and
Christoforou, 2013) for R and Bioconductor (Gentleman et al.,
2004). pRoloc is a mature R package that provide users with
dedicated data infrastructure, Visualization functionality and
state-of-the—art machine-learning methodologies, enabling un-
paralleled insight into experimental spatial proteomics data. It
is also a framework to further develop spatial proteomics data
analysis and novel pipelines. Multiple organelle proteomics
datasets illustrating various and diverse experimental designs
are available in pRolocdata. Both packages come with thor-
ough documentation and represent a unique framework for
sound and reproducible organelle proteomics data analysis.

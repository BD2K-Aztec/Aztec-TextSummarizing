ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pairing between the target sequence and the 6—8 nt long
seed sequence of the miRNA presents the most important feature for
miRNA target site prediction. Novel high-throughput technologies
such as Argonaute HITS-CLIP afford meanwhile a detailed study
of miRNAszNA duplices. These interaction maps enable a first
discrimination between functional and non-functional target sites in a
bulky fashion. Prediction algorithms apply different seed paradigms
to identify miRNA target sites. Therefore, a quantitative assessment
of miRNA target site prediction is of major interest.

Results: We identified a set of canonical seed types based on
a transcriptome wide analysis of experimentally verified functional
target sites. We confirmed the specificity of long seeds but we found
that the majority of functional target sites are formed by less specific
seeds of only 6 nt indicating a crucial role of this type. A substantial
fraction of genuine target sites are non-conserved. Moreover, the
majority of functional sites remain uncovered by common prediction
methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

The relation between miRNAs and their targets in higher eukaryotes
is part of the highly complex gene regulation network. To unravel
the functional speciﬁc interactions, the available information on the
interaction of the short RNAs as presented by the RISC complex
and their mRNA counterparts is insufﬁcient to reliably predict all
functional pairs modulating translation and mRNA decay (Bagga
et (11., 2005; Guo et (11., 2010; Lim et (11., 2005).

The basic prerequisite for miRNA targeting in metazoans is a
short perfect match complemented by imperfect matches in close
vicinity. This region is called the seed sequence and is considered
to be a 6—8 nt long substring within the ﬁrst 8 nt at the 5’-end 0f the
miRNA (Lewis et (11., 2003). It is regarded to be the most important
feature for target recognition by miRNAs in mammalians (Bartel,
2009; Nielsen et (11., 2007).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Naturally, merely seeking for short sequence matches yields
a plethora of putative target sites with a large fraction of false
positives. T0 dodge (1 priori the majority of false positives in silico
miRNA target site prediction approaches concentrate on the subset
of target sites equipped with long perfect seed matches. In addition,
several miRNA targeting determinants beyond the seed have been
proposed (Grimson et (11., 2007; Hausser et (11., 2009; Kertesz et (11.,
2007) to extract authentic target sites from the set of seed matches.
A common strategy to increase speciﬁcity is to require conservation
of the seed match. But there is evidence that non-conserved miRNA
targeting is even more widespread (Baek et (11., 2008; Farh et (11.,
2005).

To date the effect of different types of seed matches has been
assessed by means of signal-to-noise ratio (Lewis et (11., 2003, 2005),
degree of mRNA (Grimson et (11., 2007, Nielsen et (11., 2007) or
protein repression (Baek et (11., 2008, Selbach et (11., 2008). Based
on that, a set of canonical seed types that differ in abundance
and intensity of the regulatory effect has been deﬁned (Bartel,
2009). Recent experimental approaches allow for the identiﬁcation
of Argonaute (Ag0)-miRNA:mRNA ternary complexes using an
in viva cross-linking protocol and subsequent high-throughput
sequencing (Chi et (11., 2009; Hafner et (11., 2010). Chi et (11. (2009)
analyzed miRNAszNA interactions in Mus musculus neocortex
tissue samples and published an interaction map containing a set of
veriﬁed target sites in the transcriptome 0f the murine brain.

Complementing previous studies, we determined seed types using
functional target sites of the interaction map. We identiﬁed a minimal
and sufﬁcient set of six seed types. The precise mapping of Ago
footprints allowed us to distinguish between miRNAztarget and
higher resolved miRNAztarget site interaction. We quantiﬁed the
impact of individual seed types on recall and speciﬁcity. Additional
target site conservation analyses revealed short seeds to be less
conserved than long seeds.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chi et a1. (2009) provided a ntiRNAszNA interaction map that contains
the absolute chromosomal positions of sites full complementary to miRNA
seeds (murine genome assembly of 2006). These sites are located almost
at the center of an average Ago-mRNA footprint. This is a deﬁned region
of mRNA complexed with Ago determined by Ago-mRNA clusters. where
Ago bound within 62 nt of cluster peaks 3 95% of the time. For each
chromosomal coordinate. we determined the longest protein-coding mature
mRNA transcript and its corresponding relative position by means of the
NCBI reference sequence database (Pruitt at (11.. 2009). Sites that were
located within an intron (4%) 0r upstream of the 3’UTR (45%) were

removed. Ago HITS-CLIP included 20 miRNAs. whereas 18 of which are
broadly conserved [according to (Friedman at (11.. 2009)]. We proceeded
with conserved miRNAs. All mRNA and miRNA data were downloaded
from UCSC (Karolchik 21111.. 2004) and miRBase (Grifﬁths-Jones. 2010) on
October 2010.

Based on the set of conserved miRNA sequences and mRNA 3’ UTR
sequences. we determined all sites complementary to a minimum of six
contiguous nucleotides beginning at either position one. two or three relative
to the 5’-end of the miRNA. Seed matches were classiﬁed functional or non-
functional by means of their distance to Ago HITS-CLIP sites. To account
for all seed start positions. each seed match located within a distance of
two nucleotides to an Ago HITS-CLIP site was tagged functional. Since the
Ago HITS-CLIP sites were located almost at the center of an average Ago-
mRNA footprint. matches located within a distance of 3731nt could also
be functional. Since the locations of the footprints were not available. an
unambiguous classiﬁcation was not feasible. To avoid false positives. these
sites remained unclassiﬁed. All seed matches located beyond the footprint
(distance >31) were classiﬁed as non-functional. Further. two miRNAs
whose target sites were not signiﬁcantly enriched in the footprints were
removed from the dataset (Supplementary Table S2). Finally. we got 7342
functional. 64 689 non-functional and 1755 unclassiﬁed seed sites. Verifying
a required minimum target site length of 6nt. we determined all 5mer
matches. The frequency of seed matches within a footprint (distance 531)
and beyond of it was calculated for each seed match length. Additionally. to
support our results we prepared the data of the PAR-CLIP experiment in a
quite similar fashion (Hafner at (11.. 2010) (Supplementary Material).

We deﬁned the background set 52 based on the functional and non-
functional sites. A seed match s e Q was distinguished by its start position
relative to the miRNA 5’UTR (1:01. 2:13. 32y) and its length. The
outcome of this were 20 match types Spgk for a length k and a start position
type [7. The distributions of all seed match types were disjoint that is each
seed match was graded by the longest possible type. To reduce unnecessary
complexity of the seed match type set. we merged iteratively non-signiﬁcant
seed match types with their superset. Due to the hierarchical structure of
52. we were able to apply a separate-and-conquer algorithm (Supplementary
Algorithm S1). First we divided the target sites by their seed match start
position. Thus. we got three supersets composed of seed matches of a
minimum length of 6 nt containing all seed types: S35. SE6. Sig. These sets
were separated into 6mers having a mismatch at their subsequent position
(Suﬁ. S55. SM) and seed matches having a minimum length of 7nt S11}.
We tested the null hypothesis stating that the distribution of functional and
non-functional target sites is independent of a mismatch at the 3’ most
subsequent position of a seed match. Thus. if the proportions of functional
to non-functional target sites between the SP5 and the Six seed types were
not signiﬁcantly varying (P>0.05). the separation terminated otherwise
the procedure was continued for the next seed type length. A P-Value
was calculated by means of a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. The 01 seed
site separation terminated after three steps. the )3 seed matches contained
two signiﬁcant subsets and y yielded no signiﬁcant subsets. We termed
the found signiﬁcant seed types based on their start position and their
length: S N, = ‘kmerp’. For standardization. we renamed the endmost subsets:
Sig = Smarty. SE7 2 7merﬁ. S;6 = 6mery.

To estimate the signiﬁcance of our seed type set. we compared the
distribution of the functional sites with a randomized pool of functional
seed matches. We drew without replacement a subset of 7803 instances of the
multinomial distribution 52 from functional and non-functional seed matches.
A P-Value was calculated by means of a X2 test of independence.

The impact of the seed types to miRNA target site prediction was evaluated
in terms of recall and speciﬁcity. The recall estimates how many of the
functional target sites 0P are covered by a certain seed type Spgk and the
speciﬁcity computes the fraction of correctly excluded non-functional target
sites 0N.

determined in terms of pure seed ﬁnding. Their seed type selection was
assigned as described in the related literature. Due to ambiguous seed type
assignments based on the ﬁrst position of the target sequence. the speciﬁcity
and recall values for TargetScan were computed by executing predictions on
our mRNA set.

To estimate the miRNA seed type usage. we calculated the relative
frequencies of a seed type for a certain miRNA. These values were
normalized by the mean p. and the SD 0':

The conservation of each seed site was determined as described in
(Betel at (11.. 2008). We used the software package PHAST (Siepel at (11..
2005). The algorithm PhastCons is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov
model. which is ﬁtted to the input sequence by maximum likelihood. Each
nucleotide gets a score. which measures the evolutionary conservation across
17 vertebrates. For each seed match. the absolute chromosomal coordinates
were determined and a conservation score was calculated. Only if the score
of each nucleotide within a functional seed match exceeded the threshold of
0.57 (Betel at (11.. 2008). the site was tagged conserved in mammals. The
background conservation of a seed type was computed by calculating the
fraction of conserved nucleotides of a non-redundant set of UTRs holding
a speciﬁc seed type. For all statistical computations. the R programming
language was applied (R Development Core Team. 2010).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Canonical seed types of miRNA target recognition

In this work, we deﬁned a set of canonical seed types by
analyzing the seed matches of experimentally veriﬁed functional
target sites in the 3’UTR. The Ago HITS-CLIP miRNAszNA
interaction map (murine assembly of 2006) (Chi et (11., 2009) lists
15 665 chromosomal positions of perfectly matching seed sites of
length 6—8 nt belonging to 20 miRNAs frequently bound in Ago
complexes. We mapped these sites to annotated protein-coding
mRNA transcripts and retained sites located within the 3’UTR. For
each miRNA, we scanned the 3’UTRs of the transcript set for all
sites complementary to a miRNA subsequence beginning at either
position one (Oi-position), two (ﬂ-position) or three (y-position)
relative to the miRNA 5’-end. We required a minimum length
of 6nt. Seed matches of length ﬁve [as reported by (Brennecke
et (11., 2005)] were not signiﬁcantly enriched in average Ago
footprints (Supplementary Table S1). We classiﬁed these sites by
means of their distance to an Ago HITS-CLIP site and retained
miRNAs signiﬁcantly enriched in footprints. This resulted in 2369
murine genes containing 7070 Ago HITS-CLIP sites of 16 broadly
conserved miRNAs.

Each contiguous seed match was deﬁned by its start position type
and its length. The dataset was composed of eight 01-, seven 13-
and ﬁve y- seed match types (Supplementary Table S3). Following
the law of Occam’s razor, the simplest seed type setting for target
prediction should usually be the correct one. To reduce unnecessary
complexity of the seed type set, we identiﬁed unique seed types
differing signiﬁcantly from their superset in terms of functional
and non-functional site distribution. For the murine and the human
dataset, we achieved six different, disjunct types of seeds: three
6mers either beginning at the ﬁrst nucleotide (6mera), the second
nucleotide (6merﬂ) or the third nucleotide (6mery), two 7mers

Fig. 1. Deﬁnition of seed types. The seed types were termed by the start
position relative to the 5’-end of the miRNA and the length of the consecutive
seed match. The deﬁned set of canonical seed types can be surjectively
projected to the seed type set of (Bartel. 2009). Equivalent deﬁnitions could
be found for 6mery. 6mer/3 and 7merﬁ. In the case of miRNAs having a
seed sequence beginning with an uracile. 7meroi complies with 7mer-A1
and Smarty is equal to 8mer. Otherwise 6mer/3 equates 7mer-A1 and 7merﬁ
complies with 8mer. If the ﬁrst position within the target sequence is not an
adenine. Smarty equates 7mer-m8 and 7meroi is equal to 6mer. Additionally.
our set considered 6mer matches that are complementary to the ﬁrst position
of a miRNA seed (6meroz). Common target site prediction tools focus on
seeds of length seven and eight to increase precision.

either starting at position one (7mera) or position two (7merﬂ) and
one 8mer beginning at the ﬁrst nucleotide (8mer01) (Supplementary
Fig. SlA). These canonical seed types terminated within the ﬁrst 8 nt
of the miRNA in 97% of cases. This underscores the importance of
the octamer at the miRNA 5’-end. The signiﬁcance of this seed type
set was evaluated by a sampling approach. The log odds ratio of
long seed types is above zero, pointing to a better discrimination
between ﬁinctional and non-ﬁinctional sites (Table 1).

In a previous work, (Bartel, 2009) deﬁned seeds of miRNA target
recognition. Comparing this previous deﬁnition with our canonical
set of seed types, we recover this set and extend it by additional
seed types starting at the a-position (Fig. 1). The miRNA seed match
starting at position two and requiring a length of at least 6nt was
described as miRNA core seed (Bartel, 2009; Friedman et (11., 2009;
Grimson et (11., 2007). In our canonical set, it is covered by seed
types 6merﬂ, 7mera, 7merﬂ and 8mera.

3.2 Majority of functional sites are based on 6mer seeds

We examined recall and speciﬁcity affected by the individual seed
types (Fig. 2). Focusing on the relative contribution of each seed
type to ﬁlnctional sites, 6mer seeds make up the highest fraction
of true target sites (recall: 0.67). On the other hand, 6mer types

Fig. 2. Accuracy evaluation. (A and C) The impact of each seed type
on miRNA target site prediction was determined by means of recall and
speciﬁcity. The effect of the (default) seed type selection is shown for several
prediction algorithms. These values present respectively the minimum
speciﬁcity and the maximum recall of the tools. The dashed line shows an
average random prediction. (B and D) Removing non-conserved target sites

involve many false positives leading in sum to a low speciﬁcity
(0.19) and precision (0.09, Supplementary Table S6). In terms of
in silico target site classiﬁcation, the usage of a short seed type causes
an inverse prediction [Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC) < 0,
Supplementary Table S6], suggesting the avoidance of such a type.
In this case, reversing the classiﬁcation would yield a result superior
to an average random prediction.

Barely one-third of all genuine target sites are covered by seeds
of length 7 and 8. Among these seed types, 7merﬂ holds the
highest recall (0.13) and 8mer01 shows the best speciﬁcity (0.97).
The combined set of 7- and 8mer matches achieves a speciﬁcity
of 0.8 (precision: 0.19). miRNAs perform ﬁne-tuning of gene
expression, in particular 6mer seed matches are associated with
low repressive effects (Friedman et (11., 2009). As most of the
functional sites are formed by short seed sites, one can infer marginal
reduction of the mRNA level to be the predominant effect of global
miRNA-mediated regulation.

Computing recall and speciﬁcity in terms of miRNAszNA
interactions resulted in a growth of both measurements for each
seed type (Supplementary Fig. S2, Table S6 and S7). Here, only the
presence of a site on a mRNA matters, whereas in terms of miRNA
target site determination the location of a seed match relative to
an Ago footprint is important. Multiple matches of one miRNA on
a target mRNA are combined into one miRNAszNA interaction.
Consequently, multiple false positive seed matches may be united to
one true positive miRNA23’UTR interaction. Conversely, multiple
true negative target sites may be merged to one false positive
interaction. Obviously, recall beneﬁts but speciﬁcity suffers from
these facts.

Fig. 3. Heatmap showing the seed type distribution for each miRNA.
The colors affected by the row z-score indicate the bias of miRNAs to
prefer targets holding a speciﬁc seed type. A red/blue coloration implies
a higher/lower usage of a seed type compared to other miRNAs.

Moreover, we wondered if the seed type distributions differ
between miRNAs. The relative frequencies of the seed types were
computed for each miRNA. A z-score indicates miRNAs holding a
frequency over or below the mean frequency given a speciﬁc seed
type (Fig. 3). Interestingly, 6mer seed types and long seed types
are grouped to clusters, respectively, demonstrating that a miRNA
either binds to long sites or to short sites but not to both. Further,
two main miRNA cluster appeared. The larger group contains
miRNAs binding primarily to 6mer-based ﬁlnctional sites. Seven
of the 16 miRNAs carry out stronger repression by pairing to rather
long seed matches.

The importance of short seed types gains ﬁirther support by
the observation that 37% of the 3’UTRs contain exclusively seed
matches of length six in their Ago footprints (Supplementary
Table S4 lists the numbers of 3’UTRs containing seed matches of
exclusively one type.) Interestingly, the sequences of this subset of
3’UTRs are signiﬁcantly shorter than that of the superset (t-test,
P=4.53E-06). Stark et (11. (2005) studied the impact of miRNA
regulation on 3’UTR evolution and found that short 3’UTRs indicate
avoidance of miRNA regulation. This goes well with our observation
of short 3’UTRs regulated by less effective 6mer matches.

3.3 Non-conserved targeting relies on short seeds

We used a strategy established by (Betel et (11., 2008) to identify
seed sites conserved across mammals (Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Fig. SlB). The majority of functional target sites is conserved
(60%). All seed types have a higher fraction of conserved sites
than one would expect by chance, given the conservation of their
3’UTRs (Supplementary Table S5). The 6mer sites reveal an almost
equal partitioning in conserved and non-conserved sites. A clear
discrepancy between the numbers of conserved and non-conserved
sites emerges for 7- and 8mer seeds. Particularly, 8mer01 seed
matches exhibit a signiﬁcant tendency to be conserved. The number
of conserved sites in this case is more than three times as high as the
number of non-conserved sites. In terms of 7mer seeds, about two-
thirds of the seed matches are conserved, whereas 7mer01 exceeds
7mer13.

In summary, the mean probability to be conserved is about
55% for a 6mer seed. In contrast, 7mer and 8mer seeds have a
probability up to 77% to be conserved. Further, a total of 75%
of the functional non-conserved sites are covered by 6mer seeds.
Therefore, non-conserved or species-speciﬁc targeting relies to a
large extent on target sites containing short seeds.

Keeping only the conserved sites from the set of seed matches
lifts speciﬁcity of all seed types (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S9).
In particular, the 6mer seeds show a signiﬁcant increase of speciﬁcity
leading to a classiﬁcation better than an average random prediction
(MCC > 0, Supplementary Table S6).

3.4 Target prediction focuses on 7- and 8mer seed
matches

We reviewed frequently used approaches for target prediction in
mammals with regard to the implemented seed types (Table 2).
The TargetScan algorithm (Grimson et (11., 2007) seeks mainly for
seeds of length seven and eight via seed types 7mer-A1, 7mer-m8
and 8mer. The 7mer-A1 sites may be of type 6merﬂ in the event
the miRNA sequence starts with a nucleotide different to uracile.
However, the majority of mammalian miRNAs begins with an U
(Lewis et (11., 2005). Both PicTar (Krek et (11., 2005) and EIMMO
(Gaidatzis et (11., 2007) require stringent seed pairing between 7 nt
starting at either the 01 or the ﬂ-position. A novel approach called
TargetSpy seed (Sturm et (11., 2010) restricts the set of seed matches
to predictions containing a perfect 7mer.

Some algorithms allow for custom-deﬁned seed searching: PITA
(Kertesz et (11., 2007) seeks by default for sites of length six,
seven and eight that start at position two of the miRNA. The
standard setting of PACMIT (Marn and Vaniéek, 2011) is even more
restrictive by considering merely sites matching to miRNA positions
two to eight. Both tools enable adjusting of the site length by the user.
RNAhybrid (Kruger and Rehmsmeier, 2006) as well as IntaRNA
(Busch et (11., 2008) are more ﬂexible by providing a couple of
additional parameters to customize the seed search, e.g. setting the
start position. The latter is a general approach to predict RNAzRNA
interactions. Both do not suggest default seed search parameters.

The impact of the (default) seed type selection of prediction
algorithms on recall and speciﬁcity was evaluated (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Tables S8 and S9).

Prediction methods implement scoring schemes to value target
site characteristics beside the seed. In contrast to common
evaluations of miRNA target site prediction algorithms, this is not an
assessment of a subset of top scored instances but of all predictions.
Therefore, the denoted speciﬁcity values represent the minima while
the recall values show the maxima for the (default) seed choice,
respectively. Subsets composed of top scored predictions would
achieve signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁcity values.

Obviously, all prediction models exhibit a considerable constraint
regarding their ability of ﬁnding potential target sites. PITA holds

recall of 23% (speciﬁcity: 88%) restricted to ﬁnd less than a
quarter of all functional seed sites. Additional ﬁltering by removing
conserved sites increases the speciﬁcity but consequently lowers
the recall. Here, PACMIT could only ﬁnd 16% of all ﬁlnctional
sites (speciﬁcity: 73%). A higher recall but a lower speciﬁcity
can be observed for the prediction of miRNAszNA interactions
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Concluding, due to the signiﬁcant gain of
precision, tool developers recommend to use long seeds. Our study
quantiﬁed the loss of recall accompanied by this proceeding.

4 CONCLUSON

In this study, we present an analysis of the most important feature
for miRNA target recognition, the so-called miRNA seed, using a
large-scale dataset of ﬁinctional target sites. Based on the Ago HITS-
CLIP and PAR-CLIP miRNAszNA interaction maps,we analyzed
seeds properties and their inﬂuences on miRNA target site prediction
methods. Due to the deﬁnite speciﬁcation of Ago binding sites, we
were able to classify miRNA recognition elements contained in the
mRNA 3’UTR as either functional or non-functional. We deﬁned
a minimal set of seed types that is sufﬁcient for accurate miRNA
target site predictions. The ﬁnal data pool allows for enhanced
analysis of miRNA target prediction algorithms compared to earlier
studies that were restricted by experimental constraints (Alexiou
et (11., 2009; Selbach et (11., 2008). We found that most conserved
miRNAs interact predominantly with target sites endowed with short
seed matches; 67% of functional sites are based on 6mer seeds.
In contrast, common prediction algorithms focus mainly on seeds
of length seven or eight. At present, prediction algorithms have
to accept severe deﬁciencies of recall to ensure high speciﬁcity
that is naturally considered to be more important. Moreover, the
preferential search for long seeds lifts the proportion of conserved
sites. But we found that a substantial fraction (40%) of all ﬁlnctional
target sites is not conserved. Target sites including 6mer seeds are
enriched among these.

Concluding, the problem of recall can be easily translated to the
problem of precision. However, this strongly intensiﬁes the need
for features beyond seed pairing that realistically describe miRNA
targeting, in particular non-conserved target sites. It may also raise
the basic question for the potential of seed-based approaches in
discriminating between ﬁlnctional and non-functional sites.

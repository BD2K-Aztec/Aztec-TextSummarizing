same process as a histogram construction. In the construction,
we calculate either the count of the data falling in each window
or, equivalently, the density in each window. By assuming a stat—
istical model for the underlying density in each window, we are
able to quantify the statistical distance of the model to the ‘truth’
across different window sizes. From here, we can identify the
optimal window size as the one that minimizes the distance.
Once the optimal window size is estimated, further analysis,
e. g. GC correction, comparison with matched normal, CNA ana—
lysis, can be performed based on the optimal window size.
Before we propose our method, we consider in the next section
some studies that have discussed the notion of an optimal
window size in the context of next—generation sequence data.

1.1 Previous consideration of window size in the context
of NGS

Some studies have discussed or considered the problem of esti—
mating the optimal window size in the context of next—generation
sequence data. They all agree in principle that an optimal
window size is important, if not critical, in inferring any pattern
from the data [Xi et a]. (2011)]. To illustrate this point, we show
in Figure 1 the pattern of read counts in our tumour sample
(LSO41) at different window sizes.

The ﬁgure shows the distribution of read counts in chromo—
some 8 of LSO41 tumour sample using 10kb, 50kb, 200 kb and
2Mb window (~6, 31, 124 and 1227 reads per window, respect—
ively). The figure indicates that the variability of the read counts
is higher in the smaller window size and lower in the wider
window size. Moreover, the pattern of read counts at window
size 2 Mb indicates that a potential change around the position of
40 Mb is smoothed away, whereas it is visible in window sizes of
50 and 200 kb. If we decrease the window size further to 10kb,
the change is obscured under high variability of the read counts.

This example clearly shows why estimating an optimal window
size is important.

Previously, in the context of CNA analysis, and given a fixed
coverage, Xie and Tammi (2009) described the dependencies of
optimal window size on the P—values and magnitude of copy—
number ratio to be detected (r’) from ratio one. In practice, the
optimal window sizes are estimated from some preset P—values
and r’. In their proposed method, Xie and Tammi (2009)
assumed normality in the distribution of observed copy—number
ratio (Supplementary Material).

Castle et a]. (2010) considered the ‘optimal’ window size based
on detecting copy—number ratio 1.5 with a P—value of 0.001,
assuming a Poisson error model. Using this approach, with
~33 million reads in their data, they came to a window size of
164 kb or ~110 reads per window. Yoon et a]. (2009) considered
an ‘optimal’ window size as the (minimum) window size that
makes the distribution of read counts to approximately follow
a normal distribution. They noted that, in the context of high
coverage (30 x), the optimal window size is found to be ~100 bp
(0.1 kb). In other studies, the optimal window size is even chosen
arbitrarily. For example, Cheng et a]. (2011), in the context of
RNA—seq analysis, deﬁned subjectively a window size of 100 bp
in their analysis.

In the above approaches, we have an immediate problem.
When we preset the P—value of detection in advance, it relies
heavily on the asymptotic distribution of the (observed) copy—
number ratios being the normal distribution. As Yoon et a].
(2009) have illustrated, this approximation is justif1able when
the window size is ‘large enough’, but it falls short when the
window size is small. Another related problem is that the esti—
mation of optimal window size is done on the ratio data, which,
in the case of data from cancer patients, implicitly assume that
the ratio has been properly normalized to deal with the sample
contamination (Gusnanto et al., 2012).

To deal with the above problem, we propose the following
method. We acknowledge that the process of counting reads
that fall in a window is basically a process of histogram construc—
tion. In the construction, the height of the histogram in a window
is calculated as either the count or the count that has been
normalized (divided) by the total number of reads in the
genome. We refer to the latter as the ‘density’ because the histo—
gram densities in the data sum up to one. In this study, the use of
density is preferable because it takes into account different
number of reads in different datasets. In our proposed method
(Section 2.3), a window size is considered optimal if, given a
statistical model, the observed density of the read counts is
‘close enough’ to the true underlying density of reads.

The use of a histogram to accentuate genomic features is not
new [Johnson et a]. (2007) and Robertson et a]. (2007)]. On a
related method, Boyle et a]. (2008) discussed the estimation of
biologically relevant features in the genome by detecting the pres—
ence of enrichment of mapped sequence reads using the kernel
density. In the context of density estimation, both histogram and
kernel density are trying to estimate the true underlying density
of reads in the genome. The main difference being that the kernel
density method estimates the underlying density as a smooth
function, whereas the histogram method estimates it as a step
function. The estimates of density in both methods also rely on
the window size. Unfortunately, in their proposed method, Boyle

Estimating optimal window size

 

et a]. (2008) did not describe how to estimate the optimal window
size, although the kernel density method relies on the window
size for its estimates to be meaningfully interpretable. They only
set the default window size of 600bp (0.6kb) or any other
window size that makes their estimates ‘smooth enough’ or
until the kernel density estimates approximately follow a
normal distribution.

To estimate the optimal window size in the context of histo—
gram construction, previous studies in the statistical literature
have published some methods (Section 2.2). Their objectives
were the same: to estimate the window size that would make
the distance between the observed and the true underlying dens—
ity of the reads minimal. However, those approaches fall short
because of the statistical nature of the next—generation sequence
data that exhibit relatively non—regular density (as compared
with, for example, probability density).

To deal with this problem, we use data—based approaches to
estimate an optimal window. Speciﬁcally, given a statistical
model, a window size is considered optimal if it minimizes
Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) or maximizes cross—valid—
ation (CV) log—likelihood as described in Section 2.3, across a
wide range of window sizes. In Section 2.2, we ﬁrst discuss some
previously published methods of estimating an optimal window
size in the general context of probability density function. As
above, the term ‘density’ that we use from this point onwards
is basically read count that is standardized with the number of
reads in the data so that the reads densities sum up to one.

2 METHODS

2.1 Samples and sequence alignments

Using an Illumina GAII, we produced 1 836 450 and 1 653 081 reads from
DNA isolated from a fresh frozen lung tumour resection specimen and
paired blood, respectively, from patient LSO41. Similarly, we produced
3 089 173 test and 2 545 305 control reads from patient LS010. Details on
sample preparation, DNA extraction and library preparation are
described by Wood et a]. (2010). We also considered publicly available
dataset and used 44 762 968 test and 34 293 547 control reads from cell
line HCC1143 (Chiang et al., 2009) in the simulation study. Sequences
were aligned using the bwa suite version 0.5.9-r16 (Li and Durbin, 2009)
against assembly th9 of the human genome. Only sequences that could
be uniquely aligned and with mapping quality 2 37 were used.

2.2 Optimal window size in histogram construction

We discuss here some previously published methods to estimate an opti-
mal window size in the context of histogram construction. The problem
of identifying an optimal window size is well known and has received
much attention in the past few decades. In the construction of a histo-
gram, deﬁning the window size, hence, the location of the breaks, is
critical so that the histogram can reﬂect the true underlying density of
the data. In this article, we highlight this principle to deﬁne the window
size for next-generation sequence data. Let x1, x2, . . . , x,, be the observed
position of reads in the genome, assumed to be random sample from a
density ﬁx). The density ﬁx) represents the underlying true density of
reads. In this article, we consider the problem of ‘binning’ the observed
reads into equally spaced mesh or windows.

Let I,»(x) be the i-th genomic window, 1': 1,2, ...,m, and let t,»(x)
denote the left hand point of I,»(x). We denote h 2 [H1 — t,» to be the
width of the window. Obviously, the width depends on the number of

reads in the data, i.e. h”, but without loss of generality, we drop the
subscript in the notation for simplicity.

Let v,»(x) be the number of reads falling in the genomic window I,»(x).
This quantity, v,»(x), has a binomial distribution Binom(n,p,»(x)) where
p,»(x) is the probability of reads in the window I,»(x). Scott (1979) assumed
that ﬁx) is a continuous function and regular, or more speciﬁcally, a
probability density function. In this setting, the histogram estimate is
given by

which is the estimate of binomial parameter p(x). Scott (1979) is inter-
ested to minimize the integrated mean squared error

The approaches taken by Scott (1979) and other authors [e.g.
Freedman and Diaconis (1981); Hall and Marron (1987); Jones and
Sheather (1991); Wand (1997)] to estimate optimal window size are
mainly to approximate a regular density function or probability density
function using histogram. In low-coverage next-generation sequence data,
the data generally exhibit density irregularities and noticeable random
error variability. So, linear approximations that are mainly used in the
above studies are inadequate.

Moreover, many of the above approaches require an evaluation of the
integral of f(x)2 or its similar form. The evaluation of those quantities
will produce higher correction factor in the denominator of expression for
h compared with regular density function. As a result, we experience
considerable underestimation of optimal window size h.

To deal with this problem, we propose to empirically estimate the
optimal window size using CV and AIC, given a model on reads density.
An important advantage of this approach is that we do not need to
make an approximation of the underlying density of reads ﬁx), which
can be poorly estimated in sequence data. The only minor downside of
these approaches is that they require more computational power.
However, this can be overcome easily even with a moderate personal
computer.

We describe those two methods in the following section.

2.3 AIC and CV

The main concern in the existing methods to estimate an optimal
window size is the evaluation of an integral of f(x)2 or its similar
form. This evaluation makes the optimal window size heavily underesti-
mated or, equivalently, the number of windows m in the genome
grossly overestimated. To strike a balance between model complexity
(in terms of number of windows) and model accuracy (histogram density
estimation), we resort to AIC and CV to estimate the optimal window
size.

AIC and CV have been used to compare models and, in our setting,
they are used to compare models with different window sizes. When the
minimum AIC is attained, i.e. at the optimal window size, the expected
distance of the model to the underlying probability structure that gener-
ates the data is minimal.

To proceed, instead of assuming ﬁx) to be a smooth function, Taylor
(1987) defined ﬁx) as a step function

ﬁx) = Ci, X E LIX) (5)

over a given window I,»(x). The likelihood function is given by

Under the constraints 6 z 0 and 21.6,» = 1/ h, we have the familiar max-
imum likelihood estimate as histogram

Vi(X)
c» = — 7
. "h ( )
In the above Equation (7), the maximum likelihood estimate of histogram
is just the standardized reads count in i-th window.
An optimal number of windows m (hence, optimal window size) is
estimated as the one that minimizes AIC

m Vi(X)

AIC _ m —  v,»(x) log{W} (8)
across different values of m. In Equation (8) above, the penalty to the log-
likelihood takes into effect in terms of the number of windows m in the
histogram construction. To have an idea on the magnitude of m, the
number of windows we consider in our LSO41 data example ranges
from ~309 000 (in 10kb window) to 1500 (in 2000 kb window).

In addition to AIC, we also consider CV of the likelihood in (6) in
estimating the optimal window. The main purpose is to support the re-
sults that we obtain when estimating optimal window size based on AIC,
as the connection between the two methods is well known (see below). We
work with the log of the likelihood in (6), which can be written as

where v,»(x) is the number of reads in window 1' as previously deﬁned.
For a given window size, we then calculate a leave-one-out cross-vali-
dated log-likelihood

where (—s) denotes that the s-th read in window 1' is not taken into ac-
count in the calculation. Our aim is to identify the optimal window size
that maximizes the CV log-likelihood (10). The calculation of CV likeli-
hood (10) can be done relatively fast, as we only evaluate the quantities in
each window, and not each read.

In a general context, the AIC and CV methods are theoretically
equivalent in estimating the optimal window size. The equivalence of
both methods can be explained by considering that the estimation of
optimal window size is essentially a model selection problem, where the
window size h (or, equivalently, the number of windows in the genome m)
is the model parameter. Technically, we compare some competing models
and try to select the best model. In this context, the papers by Stone
(1974, 1977) as well as Pawitan (2001, pp. 381382) proved the equiva-
lence of AIC and CV in model selection and showed that the best model
obtained by AIC will also be the one obtained by CV.

In practice, however, there are some possibilities that the estimated
optimal window size by the two methods is different. In some datasets,
the AIC and CV log-likelihood curves can almost be ﬂat around the
minimum. When this happens, the differences in the estimated optimal
window size between the two methods can be attributed to random

chance. If this happens, it means that those window sizes around the
ﬂat area are almost equally optimal, and we can safely select whichever
optimal window size identiﬁed by either method that is more practical in
our application.

2.4 Simulation study

Our interest in the above estimation method is whether, at the optimal
window we estimated, the reads density we estimated in the low-coverage
data ﬁx) is the closest to the underlying true reads density ﬁx). From a
practical point of view, the true underlying reads density can be con-
sidered as the read density when we have very high coverage in our
data. We simulated a high-coverage data, which are considered to contain
the ‘true’ density of reads ﬁx). From this high-coverage data, we take
random samples to create low-coverage (simulated) data. From the low-
coverage data, we estimate the true density with ﬁx) and estimate the
optimal window size using our proposed model. The objective is to con-
ﬁrm that the optimal window size we estimated is the one that brings ﬁx)
to be the closest to ﬁx).

We produced a female highly aneuploid genome (tumour sample only)
with 19 large and small deletions and duplications using the human ref-
erence genome assembly hg19. In these data, we have 81624495 reads
(~27><), and this is considered as the high-coverage data in our simula-
tion. We mapped these reads to the genome in the same way we would do
for a real sample to introduce the same mapping biases. To simulate low-
coverage data from this simulated data, we sample with 1% probability
100 times to create 100 low-coverage simulated data with an average of
816 245 reads. One thing to note here is that we simulate the high-cover-
age data once, and the low-coverage datasets were created by sampling
from that high-coverage data. Further details of the simulated data are
presented in the Supplementary Material.

We also consider the HCC1143 cell line dataset (Chiang et al., 2009)
in our simulation study with 44762968 tumour and 34293547 control
reads (~15>< and 11><). The datasets are considered as the high-coverage
data, and to simulate a low-coverage dataset from these data, we sample
with 10% probabilities 100 times. This step creates 100 low-coverage
simulated data for each tumour and control sample. The results of
simulation using this dataset are presented in the Supplementary Material.

As mentioned above, we consider the reads density estimates in the
high-coverage data f H(x; h 2 ho) as the ‘true’ population density ﬁx), at a
ﬁxed window size ho. Being the ‘true’ density, ﬁﬁx; h 2 ho) is assumed to
be ﬁxed and known. The estimated reads density from each simulated
low-coverage data fL(x; h) will then be compared with fH(x; h 2 ho) at
different window sizes. The dependency of the densities on the window
size in fL(x; h) is made explicit in the notation here. The choice for ho is
not so critical here as they are for high-coverage data; however, we con-
sider 5 and 10 kb for ho in the simulation study.

Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst calculate the squared distance between the densi-
ties of the j—th low-coverage simulated data and the high-coverage data

R,- = / {hm h = ho) —fl(x; h)}2dx (11)

where the integration means that the squared differences are summed
up across the whole genome between the two data for each window size.
We then take the mean across the rim 2 100 low-coverage simulated data
to come up with a single number summary for each window size

1 "m

R=—ZR,- (12)

nxim j:1

At the same window size, the density estimates f H(x; h) and f L(x; h) are
comparable because the estimates are adjusted for the different number of
reads as in Equation (1). Our interest is to identify the window size that
gives the lowest R, which indicates the closest ‘distance’ between the
observed density and the simulated ‘true’ density. This is to conﬁrm

whether the optimal window size we estimated using our proposed method
in Section 2.3 gives the best estimation of the ‘true’ underlying density of
reads.

3 RESULTS

For the LS041 data, the results on estimation of optimal window
size are presented in Figure 2, based on the AIC and CV log—
likelihood. The minimum AIC is achieved at the window size
100 kb, equivalent to an average of 60 reads per window in
both tumour and normal samples. Similarly, the maximum CV
log—likelihood is located at the window size 100kb in both
tumour and normal samples. Because the horizontal axis of the
ﬁgures is in a log scale, the range of window sizes around the
optimal one that can be considered near—optimal is actually wider
than it seems to be. For example, although the window size
100 kb is optimal, window sizes between 50 and 250 kb can be
considered near—optimal in Figure 2 (Supplementary Fig. S1
where the horizontal axis is in a linear scale). This can be re—
garded as an advantage as we will revisit in the discussion section.

3.1 Optimal window size for LSOlO data

For the LS010 sample, the results on the estimation of optimal
window size are presented in Figure 3. In the tumour sample,
the optimal window size is estimated at 80 kb (61 reads per
window) using the AIC and 70kb (54 reads per window)

and it is not a contradiction because the AIC and CV log—

calculated between the read density in the high—coverage simu—
lated data and its 100 low—coverage samples. The low—coverage
samples were obtained from 1% random sampling from the
high—coverage simulated data. The ﬁgure indicates that R reaches
the minimum at window size 600 kb. This result indicates that at
this optimal window size, the distance between densities in the
high and low coverage is at its closest. Our interest is to check
whether we can estimate this optimal window size from the
(sampled) low—coverage samples, using our proposed method.
The results of this estimation are presented in Figure 5.

Figure 5 shows the AIC and CV log—likelihood from our
model (5) in the low—coverage simulated data. The figure is the
mean from 100 low—coverage simulated data, sampled from the
high—coverage simulated data at 1%. The ﬁgure indicates that the
optimal window size is estimated at 600 kb (140 reads per
window), at which the AIC reaches its minimum and the CV
log—likelihood also reaches its maximum. This conﬁrms the
result in Figure 4 that at this optimal window size the distance
of density between the high—density and low—density simulated
data is minimal.

The results of sensitivity analysis on the simulated data to
detect gains/losses in CNA are presented in Figure 6. We use
the CNAnorm package (Gusnanto et al., 2012) to analyse the
data, where we use both the circular binary segmentation (CBS)
(Olshen et al., 2004) and smooth segmentation (Huang et al.,
2007) to estimate CNA. For the CBS segmentation, the optimal
window size at 600 kb shows better combination of sensitivity
and specificity, compared with the window sizes 200 kb and
2Mb. At low 1—speciﬁcity, the window size of 2Mb shows
slightly better sensitivity compared with the optimal window
size 600 kb. This is a signature of CBS that prefers longer gen—
omic continuous regions, which exhibit gains/losses in our data.
When the data are segmented using smooth segmentation, the
optimal window size 600 kb gives better sensitivity and specificity
than the data based on window sizes 200 kb and 2 Mb.

4 DISCUSSION

The estimation of optimal window size for analysis of low—cover—
age next—generation sequence data can be considered to be a
histogram construction where the ‘breaks’ for histogram are
the window limits. As such, each experiment will result in one
particular optimal window size, depending on the underlying
features and biases, both technical and biological.

Previous approaches to this problem are problematic. Some
methods tend to underestimate the optimal window size in NGS
data because of a poor approximation to the underlying reads
density in the genome. For example, the method proposed by Xie
and Tammi (2009) resulted in an estimated optimal window size
of 40 kb (24 reads per window) to 10 kb (6 reads per window) in
our datasets, for detecting a copy—number ratio of 1.2 to 1.4,
respectively, with P—value of 0.0001 (Supplementary Material),
although CNV—Seq is only meaningful for window size >10 reads
per window. The latter requirement is to prevent the random
variability to dominate the analysis. Some other approaches,
which mainly rely on a subjective consideration, also tend to
overestimate the optimal window size. This is because having a
wide window size gives a smooth pattern of genomic features
that can easily be interpreted. However, this mainly subjective

approach ignores the potential discoveries of genomic features
that are present in short regions, as we discussed previously.
In this study, we proposed to use AIC and CV log—likelihood,
given in the model in Section 2.3, because the methods do not
depend on an approximation of the reads density, have a simple
interpretation and are relatively easy to implement.

Results from our analysis with the LS041 and LS010 data
suggest that some window sizes around the optimal one can be
considered as near—optimal (Figs 1 and 2 with a linear—scale hori—
zontal—axis in the Supplementary Material). This is an advantage
when we want to analyse NGS data across different samples or
patients. As each sample may exhibit a different optimal window
size, there may be a window size that is in the overlapping re—
gions of near—optimal window sizes across the different samples.
Our tool will help the experimenter to make an informed decision
when estimating an optimal window size to analyse the data. Our
previous experience suggested that we lose little information
when we use slightly suboptimal window size compared with
the optimal one in the analysis across different samples.

One important message that we can take here is that the cal—
culation of AIC and CV log—likelihood usually fails or becomes
uninterpretable when the window size we evaluate has <5 reads
per window on average. Although the optimal window size dif—
fers from one dataset to the next or from one experiment to the
next, we found in our LS041 and LS010 datasets that the optimal
window size is ~60 reads per window. We also found in our
study that window size of 3(P180 reads per window can be con—
sidered near—optimal. In the LS041 data, this corresponds to a

range of 507300 kb window size, and in the LS010 data, 4t}
250 kb window size.

Our proposed methods assume a simple model for the under—
lying density of reads. Therefore, our estimation of the optimal
window size depends on all technical and biological factors that
contribute to the observed signal. The window size needs to be
optimized so that it is capable of ‘tracking’ all the concurring
factors that contribute to the final signal. As an example, to be
able to correct for GC content, the signal needs to follow the GC
content bias, and a window size unnecessarily too large or too
small might prevent the best normalization. However, we have
observed that reads mapped with low conﬁdence sometimes clus—
ter in particular regions of the genome and introduce extreme
peaks in the signal that might negatively affect the optimal size of
the window, as they dominate the calculation of AIC and CV
log—likelihood. For this reason, we suggest that an estimation of
optimal window size is made on the data with good mapping
quality.

Our simulation study (Supplementary Material) indicates that
the proposed methods are able to estimate an optimal window
size that minimizes the distance between the observed reads dens—
ity in the low—coverage data and the ‘true’ underlying density.
This holds in many typical cases where, for example, structural
rearrangements are reasonable. In a rare case where we have
extreme structural chromosome rearrangements, our proposed
methods can still estimate a near—optimal window size, which is
close to the optimal one. In this regard, the proposed methods
can still be useful to identify a good estimate of window size that
can be used in the analysis.

Last but not the least, our proposed methods can also be used
in a higher coverage context as well, or, possibly, in transcrip—
tome or ChIP—seq experiments or whenever data need to be
binned in windows of predefined size.

5 CONCLUSON

In the context of the analysis of very low—coverage next—gener—
ation sequence data, the estimation of optimal window size is
critical. If the window is too narrow or too wide, we will poten—
tially miss genomic features of interest. To estimate the optimal
window size, we first assume the reads density to be a step func—
tion. Given this, the optimal window size is estimated as the one
that minimizes AIC or maximizes CV log—likelihood across dif—
ferent window sizes that we evaluate. Our analysis on LS041 and
LS010 data indicates that the optimal window size is approxi—
mately equivalent to 60 reads per window. Our simulation study
conﬁrms that the optimal window size we estimated produces the
closest distance between the reads density in the low—coverage
data and the ‘true’ underlying density.

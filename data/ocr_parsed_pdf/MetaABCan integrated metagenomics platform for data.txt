ABSTRACT

Summary: MetaABC is a metagenomic platform that integrates
several binning tools coupled with methods for removing artifacts,
analyzing unassigned reads and controlling sampling biases. It
allows users to arrive at a better interpretation via series of distinct
combinations of analysis tools. After execution, MetaABC provides
outputs in various visual formats such as tables, pie and bar charts
as well as clustering result diagrams.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metagenomics is a ﬁeld that involves sampling, sequencing and
analyzing the genetic material of unculturable microorganisms
in microbial communities while maintaining their physiological
conditions in habitats (Handelsman et al., 2007). Large amounts of
metagenomic datasets have been accumulated for analysis in these
years through the rapid advancement of sequencing technology. One
of the main focuses in metagenomics is the comparative study of
metagenomes based on microbial compositions and diversities that
are obtained by binning. Binning assigns sequences to phylogenetic
groups according to their taxonomic origins (Simon and Daniel,
2011). Recently, many binning tools, such as MEGAN (Huson
et al., 2007), PhymmBL (Brady and Salzberg, 2009), SOrt-ITEMS
(Monzoorul Haque et al., 2009) and DiScRIBinATE (Ghosh et al.,
2010), were developed to achieve higher binning accuracy.

As the above binning methods become widely used, some
data adjustment methods have lately been proposed to improve
metagenomic data analysis. For example, it is known that
454 pyrosequencing produces artiﬁcial duplicated reads (Gomez-
Alvarez et al., 2009), and Niu et al. (2010) indicated that removing

these duplicates reduced 5—23% of artifacts in 10 metagenomic
datasets. Further, when analyzing Sanger sequencing data, Weng
et al. (2010) suggested that reanalyzing unassigned reads utilizing
conserved neighboring gene adjacency can improve taxonomic
assignment. Moreover, latest studies (Angly et al., 2009; Beszteri
et al., 2010) showed that genome length normalization could
help in reducing sampling biases in estimating taxon and gene
abundances. However, current binning tools do not incorporate these
data adjustment methods while assigning reads to their respective
taxa and producing abundance proﬁles. Hence, it is essential to
integrate these adjustments and develop a more comprehensive
binning platform.

The aim of this work is to develop a single platform, MetaABC,
that integrates several binning methods, coupled with data ﬁlters and
normalization techniques for improving the taxonomic assignment
in metagenomic analysis. In addition, MetaABC presents a user-
friendly interface, provides outputs in several visualizations
which are downloadable in printable ﬁgure-ready formats and
implements a hierarchical clustering program for comparative
analysis of metagenomes. Further, MetaABC is capable of handling
data produced by both Sanger and next-generation sequencing.
MetaABC also provides a stand-alone version of the software to
deal with large datasets.

2 METHODS

MetaABC is an integrated metagenomics platform for data adjustment,
binning and clustering (Fig. 1). MetaABC incorporates two means for
removing artifacts, ﬁve tools for taxonomic binning, an approach to re-
analyze unassigned reads using conserved gene adjacency and an option to
control sampling biases Via genome length normalization. Also, MetaABC
includes a hierarchical clustering program for metagenomic comparative
analysis (see Supplementary Material for more details of these components).

3 USAGE OF METAABC
3.1 Input

MetaABC accepts data in two different forms: (i) sequences in
SFF, FASTQ and FASTA formats; (ii) a three-column, tab-delimited
abundance table. The sequence ﬁle is used for taxonomic binning,
while the abundance table is for clustering. (More details of the
inputs are provided in Supplementary Material).

3.2 Data presentation and visualization

Upon uploading the sequence ﬁle, the user must select a series of
tools and execute them. Then, MetaABC provides the total and
assigned sequence number of each ﬁle. After executing all the
selected tools, the ﬁnal results of MetaABC output different formats,
including tables, pie charts and bar charts of abundance proﬁles (see
Supplementary Material for two case studies in details).

3.3 Statistical analysis of run time

MetaABC integrates different steps for better estimation of the
taxonomic assignment, including duplicates removal, taxonomic
binning, reanalysis of unassigned reads and sampling biases control.
In two case studies, we found that the most time-consuming step
of MetaABC is either the taxonomic binning or the reanalysis of
unassigned reads (see Supplementary Material for details).

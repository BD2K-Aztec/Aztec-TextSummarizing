Abstract

Summary: Biological sequence diagrams are fundamental for visualizing various functional elem—
ents in protein or nucleotide sequences that enable a summarization and presentation of existing
information as well as means of intuitive new discoveries. Here, we present a software package
called illustrator of biological sequences (188) that can be used for representing the organization of
either protein or nucleotide sequences in a convenient, efficient and precise manner. Multiple op—
tions are provided in 188, and biological sequences can be manipulated, recolored or rescaled in a
user—defined mode. Also, the final representational artwork can be directly exported into a publica—
tion—quality figure.

Availability and implementation: The standalone package of 188 was implemented in JAVA, while
the online service was implemented in HTML5 and JavaScript. Both the standalone package and
online service are freely available at http://ibs.biocuckoo.org.

1 Introduction

 

A concise, delicate and precise picture can afford a great advantage
over description alone. The graphical representation of biological se—
quences with various functional elements is fundamental for the effi—
cient introduction and interpretation of scientific ﬁndings obtained in
the course of the investigation of molecular biological functions. At
present, biologists mainly use Microsoft PowerPoint, Adobe
Illustrator or Photoshop to diagram biological sequences. However,
these software packages were developed for the general propose of

image manipulation, so it is difficult to use them to prepare a sequence
organization diagram of sufficient accuracy. For example, the scale of
functional elements such as DNA motifs and protein domains is typic—
ally approximated, even judged by eye. Also, when using these tools,
neither the locations nor the positions of functional elements can be
precisely designated in the biological sequences.

The first attempt at providing a professional illustrator of
MyDomains for biological sequences was made by the PROSITE
database (Sigrist et (11., 2013). Using the tool, the functional domains

and sites of a protein sequence can be drawn to a precise scale. Up to
six different shapes and four different color modes are supported in
the diagramming of the protein domains. However, a pre—defined
script that specifies the precise positions of the function domains or
sites must be provided before generating a protein domain graph
(DOG). In 2009, our group also developed a software package called
DOG (Ren et (11., 2009) for plotting protein graphs in a step—by—step
manner. Although DOG was specifically designed for protein dia—
gramming, a number of researchers still used it for visualizing the
functional elements of nucleotide sequences. However, DOG is not an
optimal tool for the visualization of nucleotide sequences since it lacks
of drawing elements for nucleotide domains. In this regard, the devel—
opment of a new software package for the purpose of diagramming
both protein and nucleotide sequences is awaited.

In this work, we present a new tool called illustrator of biolo—
gical sequences (IBS) for assisting biologists in drawing publication—
quality diagrams of both protein and nucleotide sequences.
Abundant graphical elements are available for representing func—
tional elements or regulatory molecules for both protein and nucleo—
tide sequences. The standalone packages of IBS were implemented
in JAVA, and supported three major Operating Systems, including
Windows, Linux and Mac OS. We anticipate this powerful tool to
be a great help to biologists for the purpose of visualizing biological
sequences.

2 Key features

IBS provides a dual—mode interface to effectively assist the illustra—
tive diagram for either protein or nucleotide sequences. Within the
dual mode, a variety of drawing elements are implemented for the
annotations of both protein and nucleotide sequences. Also, we have
provided three color renderers for a better color appearance. By
means of the ‘export’ module, a publication—quality figure could be
generated. A user—friendly interface is provided in both the stand—
alone package and online service of IBS.

3 The protein mode

Using options such as multiple sequence presentation, the polygonal
elements for sequence annotation and enhanced markers for present—
ing functional sites, the protein DOG can be generated in a conveni—
ent manner. When drawing under the protein mode, the protein
sequences, as well as their functional domains and sites, can be pre—
cisely pinpointed by simply specifying the starting and ending pos—
itions. Importantly, as shown in Figure 1A, a variety of drawing
elements, such as polylines, polygons and information texts, have
been integrated into IBS. As a result of such a wealth of drawing
elements, the interaction factors as well as their annotation notes of
a given protein can be easily marked on the biological sequences,
which will be a great help in interpreting novel regulatory models.
In addition, the cut— and dashed lines allow the protein sequence to
be drawn when representing the functional domains that are distant
from the ‘core’ regions. To display different functional sites in one
protein, IBS also provides site markers with different shapes and col—
ors for users, as demonstrated in Figure 1A.

4 The nucleotide mode

As the result of an extensive literature survey (Supplementary Table
S1), it was found that many researchers prefer to use polygons to ex—
press the functional elements in nucleotide representation.

main organization of E3 SUMO-protein ligase RanBP2 (Flotho and Werner,
2012). (B) The online service presenting the organization of bromodomain
proteins and translocations in cancer (Muller et al., 2011)

Therefore, an interface mode with a distinct drawing style for nu—
cleotide representation was developed. In Figure 1B, the polygonal
elements that were provided in the nucleotide mode were extensively
utilized. The polygonal elements can be set to different colors and
different shapes, a feature that provides a much less constrained cap—
acity for drawing operations. Also, several polyline elements were
developed in the nucleotide mode. The color and thickness of the
polylines can be varied to represent more diversified content in func—
tional genes. Therefore, with the help of such powerful drawing
elements, the complex genomic schematic diagram can be clearly
and succinctly represented.

5 The color renderers for schematic diagrams

In addition to the earlier features, we also developed several profes—
sional color renderers in IRS. In our software, the gradient renderer
is taken as a default style for all of the drawing elements. When
using the gradient renderer to represent the functional elements or
annotations, the color and the direction can be discretionarily varied
by users. In particular, a specially designed crystal renderer has also
been developed to enhance the esthetic quality of the schematic dia—
grams. Moreover, in consideration of the demand for the drawing of
black—and—white images, IBS also provides a texture renderer. With
the help of various built—in textures, experimentalists can now illus—
trate black—and—white diagrams so as to be able to meet different
publication requirements.

6 Export of schematic diagrams

To provide a convenient means for preparing publication—quality
figures, we have developed a fully functional export module for
schematic diagrams. With the export interface, a resolution of 72,
300 and 600 dpi is permitted. Also, a variety of image formats, such
as JPEG, PNG and TIFF, are supported. To obtain a lossless copy of

the artwork, users can export the schematic diagram as a vector
image in SVG format. In addition, an XML format is provided for
the saving of all of the drawing details in a single project file.

7 The retrieval of annotations from UniProt

To facilitate the drawing process, IBS is currently equipped with a
database visualization feature through which users can retrieve an—
notations from UniProt database. By providing UniProt accessions,
annotations such as functional domains, short sequence motifs and
modified residues are automatically retrieved and plotted upon
users’ preferences. In addition, users can further manipulate the
automatically generated artwork.

8 Conclusion

Here, we have developed a novel software called IBS, which is dedi—
cated to the illustration of biological sequence organization. IBS was
equipped with many features that are specifically designed for draw—
ing both protein and nucleotide sequences. Notably, IBS was imple—
mented with a configurable database visualization interface, which
allows users to directly retrieve and specify annotations from
UniProt database for the visualization. In the near future, more dif—
ferent annotations from other databases will be integrated, for ex—
ample, the nucleotide sequence organizations from NCBI GenBank
and the cancer somatic mutation information from TCGA. Thus, we

believe that IBS is a useful tool for the biology research community,
allowing the representation of findings in a simpler and more intui—
tive way.

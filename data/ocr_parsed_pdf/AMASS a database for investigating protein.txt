ABSTRACT

Motivation: Modern techniques have produced many sequence an-
notation databases and protein structure portals, but these Web re-
sources are rarely integrated in ways that permit straightforward
exploration of protein functional residues and their co-localization.
Results: We have created the AMASS database, which maps 1D se-
quence annotation databases to 3D protein structures with an intuitive
visualization interface. Our platform also provides an analysis service
that screens mass spectrometry sequence data for post-translational
modifications that reside in functionally relevant locations within pro-
tein structures. The system is built on the premise that functional resi-
dues such as active sites, cancer mutations and post-translational
modifications within proteins may co-localize and share common
functions.

Availability and implementation: AMASS database is implemented
with Biopython and Apache as a freely available Web server at
amass-db.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Our ability to read the ‘source code’ of life has produced large
databases of biological sequences, and analysis of sequence data
has given much insight into how genes and proteins work.
Conservation at the nucleotide or residue level has unveiled the
active sites in enzymes and important binding motifs on proteins.
Sequencing of tumors has also unveiled speciﬁc site mutations
that affect the functions of important signaling molecules.
Complementing the advances in gene sequencing, mass spec-
trometry has enabled routine and rapid protein sequencing.
This technique enables the high-throughput discovery of protein
post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) such as phosphoryl-
ation and acetylation, which can dramatically alter biological
function in ways not easily predictable from the genome se-
quence. These PTMs provide yet another layer of complexity
that inﬂuences biophysical mechanisms at single residues.
These residue-speciﬁc annotations will continue to grow in sev-
eral bioinformatics databases (UniProt, 2012)

Alongside sequence informatics, the ﬁeld of structural
bioinformatics is well established, with projects such as the
Protein Data Bank (PDB; Bernstein et al., 1978) providing re-
searchers with a large collection of determined protein structures.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

New projects such as the Protein Structure Initiative (Burley
et al., 2008) are dramatically increasing the coverage of this
dataset by developing high-throughput crystallography tech-
niques. As the number of crystallized proteins has increased,
an opportunity has arisen to unify sequence annotation data
with protein structure data to gain additional insights into the
function of proteins.

Multiple Web portals have been designed that offer analysis
and Visualization of speciﬁc functional residues in proteins.
Much of this work focuses on predicting the possible function
of non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
These online databases include SNPs3D Hue et al., 2006),
SNPeffect (De Baets et al., 2012), PolyPhen (Adzhubei et al.,
2013), MSV3d (Luu et al., 2012) and MutDB (Mooney and
Altman, 2003). These databases focus exclusively on SNPs, but
recently new databases have been created to address the new
need of characterizing the functions of PTMs. Phospho3D
(Zanzoni et al., 2007) curates phosphosites from the
Phospho.ELM (Diella et al., 2008) database and provides Jmol
(Jmol: an open-source Java Viewer for chemical structures in 3D.
www.jmol.org) Visualizations of these sites on individual pages.
Another recent project is PTMfunc, which extracted nearly
200 000 phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitinylation sites
from several data sources (Beltrao et al., 2012). They established
an impressive analysis pipeline that attempts to predict the func-
tion of these modiﬁcations; however, their database does not
permit Visualization or query of novel sites.

While there is clearly a plethora of structure mapping Web
resources, they offer a heterogeneous set of features. These
databases solely focus on either variants or modifications, but
we believe that uniﬁcation of these annotations may allow re-
searchers to gain additional insights. Some of these tools offer
Visualizations of single sites on proteins, but rarely allow explor-
ation of multiple arbitrary residues at once. We believe that a
better tool would enable the interactive exploration of any set of
residues simultaneously. This would enable investigators to ﬁnd
co-localized features across annotation databases that may share
allosteric functions. Such a service would allow users to guess at
the ‘big picture’ of how a protein functions.

We have developed AMASS, a free resource that brings
together multiple databases: the UniProt KnowledgeBase
(UniProt, 2012), the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in
Cancer (COSMIC) (Forbes et al., 2011) and the PhosphoSite
database (Hornbeck et al., 2012) of PTMs. Alongside this aggre-
gation of these sequence-level annotations, our system matches
searched proteins with structures from the PDB. Structures are

Visualized with the Jmol Viewer, and sequence annotations can be
interactively explored in 3D by choking links within the interface.
With this system, users can explore the annotations and physical
location of any arbitrary residue. The system also permits the
upload of mass spectrometry data to ﬁnd possible functional
roles of thousands of queried sites by performing a search of
annotated neighboring residues. Because our resource ‘amasses’
together multiple bioinformatics databases and is rooted in the
analysis of mass spectrometry data, we have named our resource
‘AMASS’, and it can be accessed at amass-db.org.

2 FEATURES

The AMASS server allows Visitors to both (i) browse for proteins
to investigate sequenceistructure relationships and (ii) to analyze
modiﬁcation data derived from mass spectrometryibased experi-
ments. Both usage modes provide similar interfaces.

For each protein Viewed on the site, we present a table of
residue-level annotations derived from UniProt (Fig. 1). These
annotations can include active sites, clinically relevant variants,
ligand-binding residues or sites that have been studied in prior
mutagenesis experiments. Additionally, we present an interactive
bar chart that displays count data derived from two sources.
Somatic mutation frequencies in tumor samples are displayed
from the COSMIC database. We also present post-translational
modiﬁcation count data derived from the PhosphoSite database,
which aggregates modiﬁcation count data based on prior mass
spec datasets and literature publications. This count data serves
to complement the textual annotations that we provide. The
counts plot and annotations table are both linked, so that ex-
ploration of either with the mouse causes automatic highlighting
to occur in the other.

A major feature of AMASS is its mechanism for unifying se-
quence annotation data with protein structures from the PDB.
Even if the queried protein lacks an exact match, AMASS auto-
matically performs sequence alignments against homologous
structures and displays them with an embedded Jmol applet.
Users can interactively explore the structure by clicking on se-
quence annotations or on peaks in the counts plot. These actions
highlight residues in the sequence alignment, showing the user
how the mappings are made between the queried protein and

model, showing where they are located in 3D. (Fig. 2) The struc-
ture Viewing panel also contains a contacts widget that uses Jmol
to display neighboring residues and ligands that form van der
Waals contacts with the most recently selected residue.

As an example, we use AMASS to search for human KRAS, a
well-studied GTPase mutated in human cancers. Figure 1 illus-
trates how AMASS represents 1D sequence annotations and
counts, and Figure 2 shows a paired protein structure, complete
with a Visualization using Jmol and a displayed sequence align-
ment. A common cancer mutation (G12) and commonly
observed phosphotyrosine W 32) are observed near the GTP
binding site. Visualizations such as this permit investigators to
hypothesize common functional roles between the two residues.

2.1 Mass spectrometry analysis

To upload a dataset for analysis, the input is a list of capitalized
peptide or protein sequences with queried sites denoted as lower-
case letters. This set of sequences is matched against sequences
from the UniProt database. Matching proteins are presented in a
table (Fig. 3), with added columns indicating features in the

AMASS

 

protein structure that are proximal to the queried modification
sites. To illustrate the utility of AMASS, we have analyzed a
prior mass spectrometry dataset collected from human skeletal
muscle (Lefort et al., 2009). AMASS identiﬁed several proteins
with potentially interesting modiﬁcations near active sites.

2.2 Pyruvate dehydrogenase

The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a central meta-
bolic enzyme that connects glycolysis with the citric acid cycle by
converting pyruvate to acetyl-coA. Our mass spectrometry data
show that serines 293 and 295 of E1 subunit alpha (UniProt:
ODPA_HUMAN) are phosphorylated in vivo. Both of these ser-
ines are documented in the PhosphoSite database, with S293 in
particular having 625 references to external mass spectrometry
datasets. Furthermore, S293 is the most studied mutagenesis site,
with 13 references documented in PhosphoSite. Most interest-
ingly, these two phosphorylations are located in a cluster of six
phosphosites present in a short span of the protein sequence
(Fig. 4). Two of these sites (S293 and S300) are annotated in
UniProt as targets of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4
(PDK4), which is a kinase that regulates the activity of PDH
(Kato et al., 2008).

The protein has seven crystal structures in the PDB, and in one
of these structures (3exh) AMASS reported that S293 is proximal
to an interesting ligand. On Visualizing the alignments, we note
that the crystal structure was prepared from the mature enzyme
that has a 29-residue mitochondrial transit peptide removed. The
phosphosite S293 in the full-length UniProt sequence aligns with
S264 in the mature enzyme. Despite this discrepancy, the se-
quence alignment procedure of AMASS ensured that the correct
full-length phosphosites were correctly associated to the chains in
the structure. The crystal structure has four chains of this pro-
tein, and this residue is actually found phosphorylated in one of
these chains. This structure was prepared by phosphorylating
PDH with PDK4, and the heterogeneous phosphorylation of
the four chains permits comparison of secondary structure.

AMASS reported that in chain C in particular, this phospho-
serine is located close to the ligand thiamine pyrophosphate
(TPP), a derivative of thiamine (Vitamin B1), and a required co-
factor of PDH (Fig. 5). Furthermore, we readily observe that the
other phosphorylated serine S295 (S266 in the mature form) is
also repositioned in the chains where S264 is phosphorylated. It
is discussed in the corresponding publication of this crystal
model (Kato et al., 2008) that phosphorylation of the S293 resi-
due (Via PDK4) causes derangements of this phosphorylation
loop region and prevents substrate channeling to the TPP cofac-
tor, thus inactivating the entire PDH complex. In this case, S293

is well studied, yet the annotations within UniProt only discuss
PDK4 as the responsible kinase but do not assign a strong func-
tional role of S293 in regulating metabolic activity. Nonetheless,
AMASS reported the proximity to TPP, which enabled us to
uncover the literature citation associated with this PDB struc-
ture, and ultimately provided us with insight into our data. This
emphasizes the potential of AMASS to serve as a tool to inte-
grate data and help the research community improve functional
annotations of sites.

2.3 ATP synthase beta

In human skeletal muscle, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) syn-
thase is an important enzyme that provides energy for the cell
to use through the synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate
(ADP). Peptides from this protein are particularly abundant
from skeletal muscle samples. On the beta subunit of this com-
plex, AMASS identiﬁed a phosphothreonine modiﬁcation
(T213) that is located near interesting ligands in several struc-
tures in the PDB. Human ATP synthase beta has not been crys-
tallized, but several models exist of the bovine (97% sequence
identity) and the yeast (78% identity) proteins. AMASS auto-
matically aligned these homologous structures and found that
phosphorylated T213 is located nearby magnesium ions and
either ATP or ADP molecules. This site was previously investi-
gated in relation to insulin-resistant skeletal muscle, and deduced
to likely be located near the ATP binding domain based on se-
quence analysis (Hojlund et al., 2003).

Using AMASS to directly Visualize the ATP synthase beta
protein (PDB 4asu), we observe that three beta subunits and
three alpha subunits complex to form the F1 subunit. Each of
the three beta subunits has an ADP molecule present at the
active site. Additionally, magnesium cofactor ions are seen
bound to the terminal phosphates of the ADP molecules. The
T213 side chain is positioned such that direct contact is made
with the magnesium ions (Fig. 6). This finding is interesting, as
this phosphorylation of T213 could thus be an autocatalytic
mechanism due to the proximity of the ADP phosphates, or
perhaps an unknown reaction intermediate. We hypothesize
that phosphorylation of this threonine may affect catalytic

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Development of AMASS required substantial database prepar-
ation and alignment computations. Most of this effort was per-
formed ahead of time to allow rapid query and analysis for end
users. We used the UniProt database as the core foundation of
our platform. Our pipeline downloads the monthly compressed
ﬂat-ﬁle releases of Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL and parses them
with the Biopython library. A set of python scripts performs
the necessary alignments and processing, which altogether take
1 week.

We maintain a mirrored copy of the Worldwide Protein Data
Bank (waDB) on our server using rsync. The PDB has seen
exponential growth over the past decade, but there has been little
concerted effort to correlate deposited structures with protein
sequence identiﬁers. Fortunately, the SIFTS consortium
(V elankar et al., 2013) has recently established a uniﬁed database
of UniProt sequence mappings to individual chains within PDB
ﬁles. This database provided us a reliable source of sequence
pairings to which we could perform our own sequence align-
ments. At the time of writing this article, the SIFTS database
links ~28 000 UniProt sequences to ~81000 structures in the
PDB.

We used the Prody (Bakan et al., 2011) library to parse and
analyze each PDB ﬁle. For each polypeptide chain, sequences of
residue names and residue IDs were extracted. Each chain se-
quence was then aligned to its associated UniProt sequence using
Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) to determine the residue-level
mappings. These ‘chain alignments’ were stored as FASTA ﬁles
to disk. The residue IDs for each PDB chain were stored into a

Python array and serialized to an object-oriented database for
rapid retrieval. With both the computed ‘chain alignments’ and
these residue ID mapping arrays we were able to associate any
UniProt residue to residue IDs within PDB chains.

We also extracted topological data from each structure. For
every non-water residue, the ProDy selection engine was used to
find other non-water residues within a 7A distance. These pro-
tein zones were stored in an object-oriented database to allow
rapid lookup for later analysis efforts. This approach was largely
inspired by the approach taken by Phospho3D in which 3D
zones were calculated for all phosphosites. Our system performed
this neighborhood search for all residues and ligands.

Despite the large number of structures deposited in the PDB,
many human proteins have not been crystallized. Fortunately,
however, highly similar homologues can be found, either as
human paralogs or orthologs in other species. To expand the
coverage of our platform, we designed it to pair queried proteins
with homologous proteins in the PDB. Similar Web resources,
such as MSV3d, instead produce homology models of uncrystal-
lized proteins. This approach is less transparent and more com-
putationally demanding. Our approach is to instead find similar
structures and provide sequence alignments to end users, permit-
ting inspection of the similarity between the queried protein and
the Visualized structure. Inferences made at the single residue
level can be sanity-checked based on the local sequence
conservation.

This mechanism of pairing queried proteins to homologous
structures dramatically increases the utility of the system. For
human proteins, for example, the SIFTS database matches
~4600 human UniProt proteins to a structure in the PDB.
Matching to homologous sequences with 50% identity, however,
~8800 human proteins can be mapped and Visualized to a
structure.

To accomplish this sequenceistructure pairing, we used all
structure sequences documented in the SIFTS database as a
query in an all versus all BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) search
against the Swiss-Prot database. Sequences that had at minimum
of a 50% match were stored in a relational database. This cutoff
was chosen due to the steep rise of non-relevant paired proteins
that were observed at lower overlaps. Subsequently, we precom—
puted all sequence alignments between the SIFTS sequences and
matched Swiss-Prot sequences using Clustal Omega. (Sievers
et al., 2011) These ‘homology alignments’ were stored to disk.

To map a queried protein sequence to a homologous structure,
the system merges the relevant ‘homology alignment’ with the
‘chain alignment’ for the structure. The system joins these two
alignments based on the common UniProt sequence deﬁned by
the SIFTS database. This merging algorithm is implemented in
Python, where sequences are converted to linked-list data struc-
tures for efﬁcient manipulation, and then gaps are inserted into
each alignment while scanning the common UniProt sequence in
each. Once this merged alignment is produced between a queried
protein and a homologous protein structure, we can map se-
quence positions on the query protein to the protein sequence
in the PDB structure, and, then, onto single residues in each
chain. To perform this mapping rapidly, we implemented a
simple data structure in Python that represents the alignment
as a set of Python integer arrays. These arrays allow efﬁcient
random access mapping between any two sequences.

AMASS

 

While our site allows Visualization of any protein of interest,
AMASS also provides an analysis backend to scrutinize single
modiﬁcations in submitted peptide sequences, e. g. derived from
mass spectrometry experiments. The input format follows a
standard in the mass spectrometry ﬁeld, in which peptide se-
quences are capitalized and detected modiﬁcations are denoted
with lowercase letters. The user provides an email address for
notiﬁcation when the job is completed. After submitting the
data, the system checks for common errors such as non-amino
acid characters, and, then, de-duplicates non-unique peptide
sequences while keeping an internal count of coverage and modi-
ﬁcations. We encourage users to upload raw peptide data,
wherein the same peptide sequence is listed many times. This
‘spectral count’ data are reported back to the user for each
and every residue in unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed counts.

Given the list of unique peptide sequences, our system ﬁnds
the set of matching UniProt proteins from the species speciﬁed
by the user. This search is efﬁciently implemented with the
UNIX fgrep program. After this set of target proteins is
found, peptide sequences are aligned. Peptide coverage and
modiﬁcation counts are calculated and stored into a database
for long-term aggregation. After validation, the backend analysis
pipeline finds similar PDB structures and merges alignments as
described earlier. Modiﬁcations are then mapped to 3D coord-
inates, and a neighborhood of structural features is found.
Within the neighborhood residue set, our algorithm looks for
residues that have important sequence features such as active
sites, mutagenesis sites or binding residues as annotated within
UniProt. Our system also determines whether the site is located
at the binding interface between two distinct proteins in a com-
plex. Finally, the system checks nearby to look for interesting
ligands bound to the protein.

4 DISCUSSION

Our platform enables the exploration of proteins in an intuitive
manner not possible with existing tools. We hope that AMASS
will grow into a valuable resource for the biomedical research
community and we shall thus have a substantial roadmap of
desired features planned for future releases. We plan to integrate
many more biological databases to bring together more func-
tional annotations. For example, the COSMIC database has
given us an excellent jumpstart in providing mutational frequen-
cies of single amino acids; however, the recent release of full
tumor sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project
(Collins and Barker, 2007) hints that much more mutation data
can be integrated in the coming years as sequencing becomes
cheaper.

Our analysis system is simplistic, as it only considers proximity
of co-localized features to infer significance. Our primary focus
for this system was to create an interactive Visualization, as we
felt that such Visualization was not adequately implemented in
existing platforms. Nonetheless, existing platforms perform far
more sophisticated analysis of the structural consequences of
modiﬁed sites, typically for SNPs. For example, PolyPhen and
SNPs3D both offer computerized classiﬁcation of whether
amino acid changes affect function based on changing biophys-
ical properties such as side-chain hydrophobicity, charge or
packing. Adding this deeper level of analysis in the future

would improve the utility of our tool. The challenge for post-
translationalmodiﬁcations will be to ﬁnd appropriate algorithms
to assess functional consequences of these novel side chains.

We have observed that many proteins in the UniProt database
lack comprehensive functional annotations, especially when pro-
teins from less-studied species are queried. Furthermore, highly
valuable feature records such as mutagenesis sites tend to be
species-specific because those annotations arise from academic
publications that focused in a single model organism. We plan to
address this issue in the future by integrating a homology clus-
tering system into AMASS, whereby all homologous proteins
(and their associated residue annotations) can be Visualized in
alignments and simultaneously projected onto 3D structures.
This improvement poses considerable user interface design
challenges.

Many protein structures within the PDB have multiple pro-
teins in complex; however, several distinct structures can be
structurally aligned on common shared protein sequences to
elucidate other possible complexes that may exist in vivo. For
example, a structure containing proteins A and B can be struc-
turally aligned with a separate structure consisting of proteins B
and C. Such an alignment may hint how proteins A and C can
interact in vivo. Performing such alignments across all structures
may expand the set of possible neighboring features that can be
discovered. Furthermore, adopting a technique similar to
PTMfunc (Beltrao et al., 2012), whereby conserved domains
among many distinct proteins are aligned, may allow greater
generalization to be made for the functions of single sites.

With the development of AMASS, we have a system that is
capable of quickly ﬁnding functional neighbors of any queried
sites. This analysis, however, is only performed on submission of
data, or when the user explores a particular residue through the
Web interface. In the future, we plan to implement algorithms
that will automatically ﬁnd clusters of functional residues in each
structure. The challenge here is presenting the results in a format
that scores and ranks identified clusters by relevance.

Given our developed system and planned features, we envision
that AMASS will serve as a valuable tool to the research com-
munity at large by both enabling the understanding of datasets
and the discovery and annotation of unrecognized functional
sites of proteins.

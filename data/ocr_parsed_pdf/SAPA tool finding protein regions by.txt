control sequences. The region of the proteins to be scanned may
be restricted. The set minimum size of the target sequence has to
comply with all settings. Overlapping or adjoining targets will
be fused.

Three decoy methods (rifﬂed, shufﬂed, reversed) allow the user
to make a set of decoy sequences, which are scanned together
with the imported proteins for estimation of a cumulative local
false discovery rate (FDR) (Elias et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2009).
The FDR for a specific target score is two times the observed
number of decoy targets above or equal to that score, divided by
the number of all observed targets above or equal to that score.
Although the reversed method conserves local amino acid com—
position completely, the random method would scramble it;
however, it removes the natural sequence redundancy and under—
estimates the FDR. We designed a rifﬂing method, which mixes
the sequence analogous to the rifﬂed shufﬂe of a stack of playing
cards, mostly conserves sequence redundancy and destroys local
amino acid composition (for details see the programs decoy help
file, manual and the supplement).

The user selects minimum occurrence percentages for up to six
single amino acids or three groups of related amino acids, which
must be found in selected target sequences.

Up to three scaled AAINDEX amino acid proﬁles can be used
for scoring and/ or selecting target sequences, which can be set to
remain below or above a speciﬁed mean score value.

Targets are also optionally selected depending on their motif
content. The motifs are deﬁned by an extended version of the
PROSITE pattern syntax (Hulo et al., 2008; Sigrist et al., 2010),
and are combined with ‘AND’, ‘NOT’ or ‘OR’ operators.

Each target sequence is scored by the information content of
each amino acid matched by a composition setting, the scores of
the appropriately re—scaled and weighted AAINDEX scales and
the information content of the defined motifs. Details of the
scoring scheme are described in the manual and the supplement.
The scores of each protein are the sum score of their target
scores.

The result screen summarizes the applied search settings, the
scoring scheme and target/protein extraction results. A result
table shows all targets sorted by their scores and contains protein
sequence icons with highlighted target regions, where the scores
are encoded by different colour intensities. When clicking on an
icon, a pop—up window shows the sequence with the highlighted
regions. All setting and result tables may be downloaded as a
multiple Excel spreadsheet ﬁle and protein sequences as a
FASTA—formatted sequence ﬁle.

The SAPA tool enables easy subsetting of any protein list
using compositional, proﬁle and motif data, scores the targets
appropriately and estimates their FDR. The example provided in
the Supplementary information shows how the SAPA tool can
extract sequences with properties derived from O—glycosylated
peptides. Often, only a few experimentally conﬁrmed example
sequences are available. Similar sequences, when extracted, can
be experimentally investigated for more information, which
allows a new and better informed round of sequence retrieval
by the SAPA tool. For example, mass—spectrometric analysis of
fragmented peptide ions provides quantitative information on

their amino acid composition via their immonium ions; this
information can be used to extract the respective subset of
sequences, resulting in higher confidence levels for peptide iden—
tiflcation. More usage examples and references for them are
described in Section 4 of the Supplementary Data.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The web application was written in Perl, HTML, CSS and
JavaScript and runs on a web server enabled for Perl CGI (e. g.
Apache) (http://sapa—tool.uio.no/sapa/). Images of sequence
icons are dynamically produced by the Perl GD package, spread—
sheet files by SpreadsheetzzWriteExcel. The online manual offers
usage examples and screen views. The application can be
downloaded and installed locally, as described in the manual.

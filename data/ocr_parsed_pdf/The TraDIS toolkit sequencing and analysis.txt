Abstract

Summary: Transposon insertion sequencing is a high—throughput technique for assaying large
libraries of otherwise isogenic transposon mutants providing insight into gene essentiality, gene
function and genetic interactions. We previously developed the Transposon Directed Insertion
Sequencing (TraDIS) protocol for this purpose, which utilizes shearing of genomic DNA followed
by specific PCR amplification of transposon—containing fragments and Illumina sequencing. Here
we describe an optimized high—yield library preparation and sequencing protocol for TraDlS experi—
ments and a novel software pipeline for analysis ofthe resulting data. The Bio—Tradis analysis pipe—
line is implemented as an extensible Perl library which can either be used as is, or as a basis forthe
development of more advanced analysis tools. This article can serve as a general reference for the
application ofthe TraDlS methodology.

1 Introduction

Steady improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies
have resulted in an increasing number of sequenced bacterial gen-
omes, revealing extensive genetic diversity both within and between
species. Associated sequencing-based technologies, such as RNA-
seq, ChIP-seq and RIP-seq provide insight into the effects of this
variation on gene expression and regulation; however, none pro-
vides direct information on cell survival, and hence how this genetic
variation may impact the fitness of the bacterium (Gray et (11.,
2015). Transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) bridges this gap be-
tween sequence and fitness by allowing for direct measurement of
survival dynamics within a population of single transposon mutants,
by using sequencing reads flanking transposon insertions as a read-
out of mutant frequency within the population (Barquist et 111.,

(C7 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

20133; Van Opijnen and Camilli, 2013). We previously developed a
method for this purpose, called Mnsposon Qirected insertion
§equencing (TraDIS; Langridge et (11., 2009). TraDIS uses fragmen-
tation of genomic DNA followed by specific PCR amplification of
transposon-containing fragments to selectively enrich for trans-
poson-ﬂanking sequences, and can be adapted for any transposon of
interest through a simple redesign of sequencing primers. TraDIS
has since been applied to a variety of target organisms and trans-
posons in a wide variety of both in viz/o and m zzitro growth condi-
tions. These include Tn5-based libraries in Salmonella (Barquist
et (11., 2013b; Chaudhuri et (11., 2013; Langridge et (11., 2009) and
Escherichia (Dziva et (11., 2013; Eckert et (11., 2011) and Mariner-
based libraries in (Ilosti‘idia (Dembek et (11., 2015) and
Mycol)acteria (Weerdenburg et (11., 2015).

2 Library preparation and sequencing

We have made a number of refinements to the TraDIS sequencing
protocol since its initial publication (Langridge et al., 2009),
described in more detail in the supplement. We have redesigned
TraDIS adapters and primers using a splinkerette approach (Devon
et al., 1995; Rad et al., 2015; Uren et al., 2009), which increases en—
richment of genuine transposon—chromosome junctions by prevent—
ing hybridization of the reverse primer until the transposon—specific
forward primer has generated a complementary strand. We have
substituted a magnetic bead—based fragment size selection for gel—
based size selection to increase yield and allow for easier automation
(Bronner et al., 2013). Finally, we have substituted Kapa Hifi DNA
polymerase for Taq polymerase, as this enzyme has been shown to
have minimal amplification biases (Quail et al., 2012), and reduced
the number of cycles of PCR amplification to provide a more accur—
ate representation of input.

TraDIS sequencing primers are designed to begin sequencing
within the transposon sequence, so as to provide a short 8—10 base
‘transposon tag’ at the beginning of each read to verify that each
read originates from a genuine transposon—chromosome junction.
This poses a challenge for Illumina sequencing machines, as the
base—calling algorithms assume a complex sample for the purposes
of calibration. We have developed HiSeq and MiSeq recipes that use
‘dark cycles’ during which chemistry is run but no imaging is
performed to read through this transposon tag, before imaged
sequencing commences on the complex chromosomal DNA (see
supplement). Once the first read is completed, the DNA is denatured
and the transposon—specific sequencing primer is re—annealed for a
separate short 10—12 cycle transposon read. This requires a PhiX (or
other complex library) spike—in of 5—10% to prevent sequencing fail—
ure due to a lack of fluorescence in some channels. Using this proto—
col we routinely achieve results of > 90% of sequencing reads both
containing an intact transposon tag and mapping uniquely to the
source genome. We have applied this method to Tn5-, Tn917—,
Himarl- and Mu—based mutant libraries, and it should be adaptable
to any transposon of interest assuming a suitable priming site exists
(see supplement for design parameter details).

3 The Bio-Tradis analysis pipeline

To support the use of this improved TraDIS protocol, we have de—
veloped a portable processing and analysis pipeline implemented in
the Perl and R languages. The functionality provided is similar to
that in other recently published TIS analysis pipelines (DeJesus
et al., 2015; Solaimanpour et al., 2015 ), however our command—line
driven approach has been designed with a production environment
in mind, where many sequencing libraries may be processed simul—
taneously. We provide tools for each step of analysis from the raw
unaligned fastq files produced by the sequencer, through to predic—
tions of gene essentiality and fitness effects. The main pipeline script,
bacteria_tradis, filters reads in fastq format for transposon tags, re—
moves these tags, then maps the modified reads using the SMALT
short read mapper (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/
smalt/), with support for multiple contigs and/0r replicons, such as
plasmids. Default k—mer, step size and percent identity parameters
are set depending on input read length, though these can be manu—
ally specified by the user. The mapped bam file is then processed to
produce plot files, containing insertion counts per nucleotide, suit—
able for visualization in the Artemis genome browser (Carver et al.,
2012) and for further analysis. The mapping, processing, and data
manipulation steps are implemented as self—contained Perl modules

that could be easily used as a foundation for the development of
more sophisticated analyses.

Additional scripts are provided to process these plot files in con—
junction with genome annotations in EMBL—Bank format to pro—
duce annotated tab—delimited files containing various statistics
including read counts and unique insertion sites per gene. Two basic
analysis scripts for this gene—level data written in R are available.
One, tradis_essentiality.R, produces predictions of gene essentiality
within a high—density transposon library based on the empirically
observed bimodal distribution of insertion sites over genes when
normalized for gene length (Barquist et al., 2013b; Langridge et al.,
2009). The second, tradis_comparisons.R, applies the edgeR pack—
age (Robinson et al., 2010) to identify significant differences in read
counts, and hence mutant frequencies, between experimental condi—
tions (Dembek et al., 2015) providing insight into the relative contri—
bution of all mutagenized genes to fitness under the assayed
condition.

4Summary

We have described recent refinements to the TraDIS method for the
sequencing and analysis of dense transposon libraries. These include
an optimized sequencing protocol, and processing and analysis tools
that can rapidly provide insight into the contribution of genomic re—
gions to organismal fitness. It is our hope that making these tools
more accessible will accelerate their application to an ever wider
variety of bacteria and experimental conditions.

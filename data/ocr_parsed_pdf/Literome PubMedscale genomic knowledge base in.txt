ABSTRACT

Motivation: Advances in sequencing technology have led to an expo-
nential growth of genomics data, yet it remains a formidable challenge
to interpret such data for identifying disease genes and drug targets.
There has been increasing interest in adopting a systems approach
that incorporates prior knowledge such as gene networks and geno-
type—phenotype associations. The majority of such knowledge resides
in text such as journal publications, which has been undergoing its
own exponential growth. It has thus become a significant bottleneck to
identify relevant knowledge for genomic interpretation as well as to
keep up with new genomics findings.

Results: In the Literome project, we have developed an automatic
curation system to extract genomic knowledge from PubMed articles
and made this knowledge available in the cloud with a Web site to
facilitate browsing, searching and reasoning. Currently, Literome
focuses on two types of knowledge most pertinent to genomic medi-
cine: directed genic interactions such as pathways and genotype—
phenotype associations. Users can search for interacting genes and
the nature of the interactions, as well as diseases and drugs asso-
ciated with a single nucleotide polymorphism or gene. Users can also
search for indirect connections between two entities, e.g. a gene and a
disease might be linked because an interacting gene is associated
with a related disease.

Availability and implementation: Literome is freely available at liter-
ome.azurewebsites.net. Download for non-commercial use is avail-
able via Web services.

1 INTRODUCTION

The cost of sequencing a full human genome has re-
cently dropped below $1000 (www.illumina.com/systems/hiseq—
x-sequencing-system.ilmn). The impending broad availability of
genomics data holds the promise of making personalized medi-
cine a reality. There has been a rapid rise of interest in applying
sequencing in clinical applications such as cancer treatment and
pediatrics, as well as in consumer genomics such as 23AndMe.
However, it remains a signiﬁcant challenge to interpret genomics
data for identifying causal genes for diseases and proposing
novel drug targets. For complex diseases like cancer, the causal
mechanism is complex and involves the synergistic interactions
of many genetic components (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011).

Consequently, there has been increasing interest in adopting a
systems approach to boost the signal-to-noise ratio by integrat-
ing prior knowledge such as gene networks (Ideker et al., 2011).
Of equal importance is to keep up with new genomics findings
and automate the process of genomic interpretation, as the evi-
dence for diagnosis and treatment has grown from a handful of
symptoms into hundreds or even thousands of genome-scale
markers.

The majority of biomedical knowledge resides in free-text pub-
lications from online repositories such as PubMed (www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), which currently contains >22 million pub-
lished articles and is growing by >1 million each year. This
makes it a priority to automate curation of genomic knowledge
for scientiﬁc and translational research.

In the Literome project, we have developed a natural-language
processing (NLP) system to automatically extract biomedical enti-
ties and relations from PubMed abstracts and made the resulting
knowledge base available on the Internet. Currently, Literome
focuses on entities and relations most pertinent to genomic medi-
cine: genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), diseases and
drugs, related through genomic interactions (e.g. transcription
factors and kinases) and genome-wide associations (e.g. SNPe
drug or genewlisease associations). Users can browse and search
the resulting knowledge base in the Literome Web site, which will
be kept up to date as new abstracts become available. The Web
site and the knowledge base are deployed on Azure (azure.micro-
soft.com). It is straightforward to apply Literome to full texts (e. g.
PubMed Central). We will pursue this in future work.

2 KNOWLEDGE BASE AND FEATURES

The Literome knowledge base currently features two types of
knowledge particularly relevant for genomic medicine. First, it
curates directed genic interactions by extracting transcriptional
and regulatory events from text. Each interaction consists of
three parts: a type indicating the regulatory direction (positive,
negative or unspeciﬁed), a theme that undergoes a speciﬁc
change (e. g. the gene being transcribed into messenger RNA or
the protein being phosphorylated) and a cause that brings forth
the change (the transcription factor or the kinase). Second, it
extracts genotypeephenotype associations from abstracts to
curate ﬁndings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
Genotype refers to either a gene or an SNP. Phenotype refers to
the presence of a disease or a drug reaction. An association is a
potential correlation between the two. Literome retains the prov-
enance information, so that users can read the sentences or
abstracts behind each extraction for veriﬁcation and context.

Browsing: Browsing is available for users interested in explora-
tory studies. Figure 1 shows a sample browsing process: the user
selected entity type ‘genes’, entered a query, received a list of
genes, selected a subset (ABCA1,. . .,ABCA5) and was shown
drugs and diseases associated with that gene, along with the
PubMed abstracts, viewable from ‘details’.

Searching: Users can search for relations between two speciﬁc
entities. These could be two genes (as in pathway interactions) or
a genotype and a phenotype (as in genome-wide associations).
All instances supporting a relation are shown for users to review.

Reasoning: Users can search for relations that are not explicitly
mentioned in text but can be inferred from other relations. For
example, if A regulates B, and B regulates C, then it is likely that
A can regulate C. Search results for genic interactions can thus
be augmented by transitivity. Likewise, GWAS search results can
be augmented by considering associations among related geno-
types and phenotypes. Currently, Literome uses these types of
relation expansion: SNPegene (SNP belongs to gene region),
geneegene (directed interaction between the two genes) and dis-
easeedisease [neighbors or cousins in the Disease Ontology
(Schriml et al., 2012)].

Feedback: Users can reinforce, refine or contradict each extrac-
tion by clicking buttons next to it. As Literome is based on a
machine-learned system, feedback could potentially be used to
improve the quality of future extraction.

3 APPLICATIONS

GWAS Imagine a researcher has found a tentative association
between SNP S and disease D in a new study. This evidence alone
might not be meaningful, but if prior ﬁndings suggest associ-
ations between S and D (or between related SNPs and diseases),
the possibility that this finding is significant substantially in-
creases. In addition to association ﬁndings, Literome also cata-
logs genic interactions and known phenotype relations such as
the Disease Ontology, enabling powerful related search (e.g.
from SNP to nearby gene, then to interacting gene, finally to
related disease).

Network analysis Literome offers a comprehensive and up-to-
date collection of published genic interactions, including causal-
ity and direction (e.g. A upregulates B versus B downregulates
A). Such a gene network can serve as input in a systems biology

or network-based approach. This collection of published ﬁndings
can also be used to validate de novo pathway predictions.

Knowledge curation Literome can be used to increase product-
ivity in manual curation. By biasing toward recall and eliminat-
ing the vast majority of obvious non-ﬁndings, Literome enables
curators to concentrate on the small fraction of text likely to
contain relevant ﬁndings. Moreover, it is much more efficient
to curate by correcting errors with a button click, rather than
annotating from scratch.

4 DISCUSSION

Literome used an NLP pipeline to extract entities and relations
from text; see Supplemental Method for details.

The Literome knowledge base has several distinct advantages
over existing related resources. With automatic curation,
Literome offers more comprehensive and up-to-date coverage
compared with manually curated databases such as Welter
et a]. (2014) and Whirl-Carrillo et a]. (2012). By extracting inter-
action types and directions, Literome provides important de-
tailed information generally missing in network resources such
as Thomas et a]. (2012). Like Landeghem et a]. (2013), Literome
recognizes much more diverse patterns for genic interactions
than systems such as Chen and Sharp (2004) that used a small
verb lexicon. Additionally, by assimilating both genetic and med-
ical knowledge, such as pathway interactions and GWAS ﬁnd-
ings, Literome enables powerful reasoning that is only possible
by integrating the two. Finally, sharing the growing interest in
accelerating curation with automatic tools (Wei et al., 2012),
Literome includes a feedback mechanism that could drive
eCuration.

In conclusion, Literome provides a cloud-based knowledge
base for genomic medicine, featuring knowledge automatically
curated from PubMed abstracts by an NLP system. It offers
powerful search and exploration capabilities as well as a feed-
back mechanism to continuously improve annotation and
extraction.

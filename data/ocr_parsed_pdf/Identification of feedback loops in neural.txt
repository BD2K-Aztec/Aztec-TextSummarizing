ABSTRACT

Motivation: Feedback circuits are crucial network motifs,
ubiquitously found in many intra- and inter-cellular regulatory
networks, and also act as basic building blocks for inducing
synchronized bursting behaviors in neural network dynamics.
Therefore, the system-level identification of feedback circuits using
time-series measurements is critical to understand the underlying
regulatory mechanism of synchronized bursting behaviors.

Results: Multi-Step Granger Causality Method (MSGCM) was
developed to identify feedback loops embedded in biological
networks using time-series experimental measurements. Based on
multivariate time-series analysis, MSGCM used a modified Wald test
to infer the existence of multi-step Granger causality between a
pair of network nodes. A significant bi-directional multi-step Granger
causality between two nodes indicated the existence of a feedback
loop. This new identification method resolved the drawback of the
previous non-causal impulse response component method which
was only applicable to networks containing no co-regulatory forward
path. MSGCM also significantly improved the ratio of correct
identification of feedback loops. In this study, the MSGCM was
testified using synthetic pulsed neural network models and also in
vitro cultured rat neural networks using multi-electrode array. As a
result, we found a large number of feedback loops in the in vitro
cultured neural networks with apparent synchronized oscillation,
indicating a close relationship between synchronized oscillatory
bursting behavior and underlying feedback loops. The MSGCM is
an efficient method to investigate feedback loops embedded in in
vitro cultured neural networks. The identified feedback loop motifs
are considered as an important design principle responsible for the
synchronized bursting behavior in neural networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

Feedback circuits are key regulatory motifs in many biological
systems. Previous studies show that positive feedback loops

determine a variety of cellular processes such as development, cell
proliferation, apoptosis and responses to stress (Eisen et (11., 1967;
Wolpert and Lewis, 1975), and negative feedback loops contribute
to maintaining the homeostasis of biological systems under internal
and external interferences (Kim et (11., 2008; Maeda et (11., 2004).
Moreover, many functional modules in biological systems are
composed of multiple feedback loops. Various nonlinear dynamic
behaviors of biological systems are generated by combination of
positive and negative feedback loops (Glendinning, 1994; Strogatz,
2000). Interlinked fast and slow positive feedback loops (Brandman
et (11 ., 2005) can form a ‘dual-time’ switch which is rapidly inducible
and also resistant to noises propagated from the upstream signaling
system. Coupled direct and indirect positive feedback loops induce
robust synchronized bursting behaviors (Dong et (11., 2009a).
Identifying the existence of an intra- or inter-cellular feedback
circuit in biological networks is an important systems biological
issue. A variety of network motif search tools (Alon, 2007) such as
mﬁnder (Kashtan et (11., 2002), FANMOD (Wernicke and Rasche,
2006) and MAVisto (Schreiber and Schwobbermeyer, 2005) were
proposed to ﬁnd small vertex-induced subgraphs (occurring more
frequently than those in random networks) from a network with
known topology, but such methods cannot be used to identify hidden
feedback loops in a network with unknown topology from time-
series measurements On the other hand, time-series measurements of
dynamical responses are now increasingly available [e.g. real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Heid et (11., 1996), microarray
(Schena et (11 ., 1995), immunoﬂuorescence (Henle and Henle, 1966)
and multi-electrode array (Chong et (11., 2011)] and various types of
biological networks can be investigated using such data. So, there is
a pressing need to develop an efﬁcient method to identify feedback
loops from multi-channel dynamical response data. Based on time-
series analysis and system identiﬁcation theory, several methods
have been proposed to tackle this problem. For instance, Caines
and Chan (1975) proposed the likelihood ratio test method (LRTM)
based on the minimum phase spectral factor (MPSF) which is a
canonical representation of the power spectral density matrix of
the joint stochastic process of input and output data. In LRTM, the
feedback effect between two-partitioned node sets was investigated
with (1 priori knowledge on the system order and structure. Although
LRTM can identify a feedback loop between two-partitioned node
sets, it cannot identify a feedback loop between two individual nodes
in the network. Schnider et (11. (1989) developed a direct coherence
method in the frequency domain to detect feedbacks in the central

Identification of feedback loops based on multi-step Granger causality

 

nervous system. Subsequent studies have further developed and
extended this method for other physiological applications such as
detecting bi-directional hippocampal interactions between the CA3
and CA1 regions (Baccala and Sameshima, 1999) and quantifying
the linear causal strength in closely interacting cardiovascular
variability signals (Porta et (11., 2002). The direct coherence approach
can unravel the existence of a strong or weak feedback interaction
between two variates, but a statistical test of this approach has not yet
been provided. In our previous study, we have developed the non-
causal impulse response component method (NIRCM) (Dong et (11 .,
2009a, b) on the basis of correlation identiﬁcation and spectral factor
analysis. NIRCM does not require any explicit knowledge about the
system order or structure and has also relatively low computational
complexity, but it was only applicable to networks that do not include
co-regulatory forward paths.

Although several different methods for identiﬁcation of biological
feedback loops have been developed, all the methods still have
ﬁindamental limitations in ﬁnding feedback interactions between
individual nodes in complex biological networks without (1 priori
knowledge on the system. Hence, it is indispensable to develop
a more efﬁcient identiﬁcation method which can overcome such
difﬁculties of the previous methods. In this study, we proposed
a multi-step Granger causality method (MSGCM) to identify the
feedback loops embedded in biological networks where a pair of
nodes might share some common predecessors. Note that NIRCM
cannot be applied to networks in case input and output noises from
a pair of nodes are correlated through a co-regulating predecessor
(Caines and Chan, 1975). Basically, MSGCM is a multiple time-
series analysis method based on the vector autoregressive (VAR)
model. So, it is suitable to identify feedback loops between any
pair of network nodes by simultaneously analyzing all dynamical
couplings inside the network. The parameter values of the VAR
model are estimated using the multivariate least-squares method
(MLSM) (Ruppert and Wand, 1994). Then, a multi-step causality
test is applied to the VAR model with the estimated parameter
values to infer the h-step causality between all pairs of nodes.
In particular, modiﬁed Wald statistics were used to avoid the
problem of matrix rank reduction (Liitkepohl, 2005). Finally, an
asymptotic distribution of the Wald statistics was formed to examine
the existence of h-step causality. Bi-directional h-step causality
between a pair of nodes indicates the existence of a feedback
loop between the two nodes. This method can be considered as
a natural extension of the NIRCM to multivariate systems by
introducing multivariate time-series analysis. Since the dynamical
couplings between nodes can be decoupled by MSGCM, it will be
more useful for the identiﬁcation of feedback loops in a densely
connected biological network. We applied the proposed MSGCM to
synthetic neural network simulation data based on Spike Response
Model (SRM) and also to the time-series data obtained from in
vitro cultured neural networks. As a result, a signiﬁcant number of
feedback loops were identiﬁed from the synchronized oscillatory
behaviors, indicating a close correlation between such behaviors
and the underlying feedback loops.

2 METHODS
2.1 VAR model

Dynamical characteristics of complex systems such as biological networks
can be inferred from the analysis of a multivariate stochastic model ﬁtted

to the observation of time-series data (Tiao and Box. 1981). In practice.
many spontaneous time-series data are considered as the measured output of
stationary stochastic processes (Ross. 1996). Assume Xk = (x1(k). x2(k).  .
xN (k))/ (k: 0. :l:1. :l:2.  . which indicates the time index) to be a stationary
multivariate stochastic process. Xk denotes the N -dimensional measurements
vector of the biological network composed of N -nodes. The purpose of
feedback loop identiﬁcation is to infer the bi-directional dynamical coupling
between any pair of nodes x,»(k) and xj(k). where i,j = 1,2, . . .,N with [#j. In
this study. the dynamical coupling is conceptually identical to the directional
multi-step (say h-step. where it can be any positive integer up to inﬁnity)
Granger causality that is described in detail in the following section. If bi-
directional multi-step Granger causalities are identiﬁed between two nodes.
it means that a feedback loop exists between them.

Among various models representing stationary multivariate time-series
data (Brillinger. 2001; Cadotte et (11.. 2008; Liitkepohl. 2005). the VAR model
is selected here to model biological multivariate data because of its feasibility
and ease of computations. The pth-order VAR model (VAR(p)) is constructed
by expressing Xk. the value of a (multivariate) process X at current time k.
with its past values weighted with certain coefﬁcients A, and a (multivariate)
white noise value Ek:

p
Xk=V+ZAiXk_i+Ek, k=0,:l:1,:l:2,..., (1)
[:1

where X1, = (x1(k), xz(k), ...,xN (k))’, E, = (21(k),22(k), . . .,eN (k))’ and
V 2 (v1 ,v2, . . . , WV), which is a constant vector of intercept terms representing
the mean of Xk.

For a given vector of multivariate time series. its VAR(p) model can be
readily estimated by MLSM (Ruppert and Wand. 1994). Suppose that we
have a sample of size L for each of N variates with the same sample period.
The estimation ofA:=[A1, A2,  ,A],]N W) is calculated as follows:

A=Y0X’(XX’)“, (2)

In addition. an unbiased estimate of the covariance matrix 25 of Ek is

obtained as (Liitkepohl. 2005)

If the preceding estimation procedures are repeated for different p-values.

the order of the VAR(p) model can be selected by HQ criterion (Hannan and

Quinn. 1979) which provides an optimal solution of [7 using the knowledge

of data size L. network dimension N and estimated covariance matrix 25.
According to the HQ criterion. model order p is estimated by optimizing

Therefore. the optimal order can be determined as poplzargmin(HQ(p)).

The advantage of the HQ criterion is that pop, is a consistent estimator
f7 converging in probability to p. which is superior to other estimators
using different criteria such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Final

2.2 h-Step optimal prediction and multi-step causality

The concept of multi-step Granger causality is deﬁned in light of an optimal
prediction of the future value of one variate by using the current and past
values of all network variates (Granger. 1969). If a contribution to the
prediction comes from the variate itself. it is considered as a self-coupling;

otherwise. if a contribution comes from the other variates. it is called an alien
coupling. Such predicted effects include not only most recent contributions
but also very earlier contributions of all variates. depending on how much
delayed couplings reach from the variates. We use h-step (h can be 1, 2, . . . , 00.
and it denotes the number of sampling periods) to quantify such ‘multi-step’
delayed coupling effects. In the following. some crucial inferences. such as 11-
step optimal prediction of aprocess and multi-step Granger causality between
network variates. are immediately derived from the identiﬁed VAR(p).

For an N -dimensional stable VAR(p) process denoted by X1 = (x1(k).
x2(k). ... . xN (k))’. it was shown that the minimum mean square error (MSE)
predictor for prediction horizon h at prediction origin k is the conditional
expected value

Ek(Xk+h)I=E(Xk+h llellgk})~ (5)

which minimizes the MSE of Xk+h (Liitkepohl. 2005). Herein. the notation
{X1 |1< k} stands for all available information of X until time k. For a zero
mean representation of the VAR(p) model. the optimal h-step predictor (in
the sense of minimum MSE) of X1 at origin time k can be represented as

Xk(h)=J(IN,,+Z+Z2+...+Z’1—‘)17+JZ’1§,,, he {1,2,...,oo}, (6)

The h-step prediction error is Ek(h)=Xk+h—Xk(h)=ZZ:O <I>,,,ek+h_,,,
and the corresponding prediction error covariance matrix is 2X01):
 <I>,,,EE<I>;H. where <1)", :=JA’”J’ and EE is the covariance matrix of
white noises E1. The proof of the above derivation is provided in the
Supplementary Material (Section 1).

Equation (6) shows how all the network variates contribute to predicting
each single variate. For instance. (it). which corresponds to the jth row
in Equation (6) U: 1. 2.  . N). is the optimal (minimum MSE) h-step
predictor of the jth variate x(k) at origin k obtained by using the current
and past information of all variates. The corresponding prediction MSE is
denoted by 2Xi(h|{X1|1<k}) (i: 1. 2.  . N). The prediction MSE will
increase if the information of some preceding variables is not considered.
So. multi-step Granger causality from a stochastic variate x1(k) to another
variate x2(k) was formally deﬁned as follows (Granger. 1969): the process
x1(k) is said to cause x2(k) in multi-step Granger’s sense if

212(hllXill<k})< 212(hllXill</<} \{X1(S)|»Y<k}) (7)

for at least one it 6 {1,2, . . . , oo} (in practice. we only need to check for a ﬁnite
stepisee later of this section for details). i.e. the prediction of x2(k) can be
improved if the past and current information in x1(k) is taken into account
in addition to all the relevant information under consideration [the backslash
in Equation (7) denotes the exclusion of the information of {x1(s) ls g k }].

Note that the case of h = 0 is considered as instantaneous Granger causality
which is physically unfeasible in biological networks because there is usually
a signiﬁcant time delay accompanied with the coupling process. So. we
have excluded in this article such instantaneous Granger causality as well as
self-coupling for nontrivial discussion. That is. only delayed alien (between
different variates) couplings are considered in this article. Feedback loops
are found when signiﬁcant bi-directional multi-step Granger causalities are
identiﬁed between two different network variates.

Multi-step Granger causality is fairly easy to evaluate in the context of
a VAR model. Let us consider the multi-step Granger causality between
two variates x,»(k) and xj(k) (i,j=1,2,...,N and 175]) in an N-dimensional

network. Consistent with the deﬁnition of multi-step Granger causality. x,»(k)
is called h-step non-causal for xj(k) if the m-step ahead predictions of xj(k)
cannot be improved for all m g h by taking into account the past and present
xi(1)(1<k). Therefore. x,»(k) is h-step non-causal for xj(k) if and only if
all elements in the jth row and 1th column in matrix “[4,1]” which is the
1th column block matrix of JN’" (for m=1,2,...,h and 1:1,2,...,p). are
zeros. This means that there is no contribution from the regulating variate
x,»(k) to the prediction of the regulated variate xj(k) until h-step delays. We
can derive this from h-step optimal predictor Xk(h) [see Equation (6) and its
expansion in Equation (8)]:

Xk(h)=J(IN,,+71+712+ - - - +2“)?
+ [171i]le +[JZ’1]2X,._1+---[JZ’1]pXk_,,+1. (8)

For a two-partitioned process. one-step Granger causality is equivalent to
multi-step Granger causality (details can be found from Baccala et al.. 1998).
The problem of feedback identiﬁcation is now transformed into a problem
of investigating whether non-diagonal blocks in A1 (1: 1,2,...,p) are zero
simultaneously or not. However. in most biological networks. researchers
are often interested in the causal couplings between a pair of variates rather
than those between two-partitioned variate sets. Therefore. it is necessary to
develop an approach to identify the multi-step Granger causality between
any two variates in a higher dimensional network (N 2 3). In the previous
analysis. we need to prove h-step non-causality up to inﬁnity to show that
x,»(k) does not contribute to the predictions of xj(k) (in the sense of multi-step
Granger causality) in a multi-dimensional network. This task seems daunting
and time-consuming. However. Dufour and Renault (1998) showed that we
only need to examine a limited step of p(N —2)+1 instead of examining
until inﬁnite steps. This makes a statistical test of the MSGCM feasible
for computation. See Supplementary Material (Section 2) for details on the
modiﬁed Wald test to examine the multi-step Granger causality.

2.3 The algorithm for identiﬁcation of feedback loops
based on MSGCM

In this section. we propose an algorithm to identify feedback loops in
multivariate biological networks. As this algorithm is based on the foregoing
multi-step Granger causality test. it is called the MSGCM. The MSGCM
algorithm can be implemented in Matlab 2007 (Mathworks. Inc.) [codes are
provided in the Supplementary Material (Section 8)] and the identiﬁcation
steps are summarized in Figure 1.

The aforementioned algorithm can identify direct couplings as well as
indirect couplings. i.e. when the signal from one node is or is not relayed
through another node(s) before reaching the target node since the predictions
for one variate would naturally include these two parts of contributions
that usually appear in different prediction step it. In the following section.
MSGCM is applied to simulated datasets obtained from computational
neural network models [i.e. synthetic pulsed neural networks. see the
Supplementary Material (Section 3) for a brief introduction of the models].
It turns out that MSGCM can successfully identify the direct as well as
indirect feedback loops in two-. three- and (a more complicated) six-node
networks. See the Supplementary Material (Section 4) for details on the
sampling method of spike data. In our analysis. we used a limited bin size
to low-pass ﬁlter the spike train data. In particular. a bin size of 10 ms was
chosen to minimize false-positive identiﬁcation (Golub and Van Loan. 1996).
The sampling with a 10 ms interval corresponds to the low-pass ﬁltering with
the cutoff frequency of 100 Hz. which can ﬁlter out high frequency noises
that contribute to false-positive identiﬁcations.

2.4 Multichannel recordings of in vitro neural networks

Hippocampal or cortical neurons used for developing in vitro neural
networks were isolated from the brain of the Sprague-Dawley rat at
embryonic day 18 (E18). Mechanically dissociated neurons were seeded on
a planar-type microelectrode array (MEA) which has 60 surface-embedded

humidiﬁed incubator with 37°C. 5% C02. After 2 weeks of maturation period
inside the incubator. the cultured MEA chip was connected with a MEA1060-
BC preampliﬁer (Gain 50. BW 0.178500 Hz; Multi Channel Systems.
Reutlingen. Germany) and FA60S ampliﬁer (Gain 20. BW 1075000 HZ;
Multi Channel Systems). Multichannel signals were digitized and processed
by MC Rack (Multi Channel Systems) and Ofﬂine Sorter (Plexon Inc.. TX.
USA). Extracellular action potentials (spikes) were detected by setting the
threshold level at 5 X standard deviation (SD of background noise level) and
spike waveforms were classiﬁed (sorted) by principal component analysis
(PCA) using dedicated spike sorting program (Ofﬂine Sorter). There can
be multiple neurons (or units) generating spikes near a sensor. So. detected
spikes are classiﬁed and clustered according to the shape of spikes. PCA
has been used as one of the classiﬁcation techniques to ﬁnd a well-clustered
spike signals (Hill et al.. 2011).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Synthetic neural network simulations

To examine the efﬁcacy of MSGCM for identiﬁcation of feedback
loops, we ﬁrst applied it to two- and three-node pulsed neural
networks of 12 different topologies as shown in Supplementary
(Section 5) Figure S3a. The spike trains of each network were
displayed for a period of 1 s, extracted from 20 s simulations
[Supplementary (Section 5) Fig. S3b]. Finally, the sampled time-
series data of the neurons in each network were obtained as
shown in Supplementary (Section 5) Figure S3c. Based on these
time-series data, MSGCM was applied to the six networks. As a
result, we successﬁllly identiﬁed the existence of feedback loops

in all two- and three-node network topologies. The key parameters
and results for identiﬁcations are summarized in Supplementary
(Section 5) Table S1.

The MSGCM was also applied to a more complicated six-
node network model containing two direct feedback loops and
one indirect feedback loop. We constructed this model based on
the same dynamical mechanism as those of the previous two- and
three-node pulsed neural network models (Fig. 2a). Based on the
obtained time-series data (Fig. 2c), MSGCM was then used to
identify the existence of feedback loops with three multiples of the
SD credence level (01 = 0.00135). Using HQ criterion, we determined
an optimal order popt=6 which corresponds to an HQ value of
—7.5071. With the estimated parameters of the VAR(6) model, the
Wald statistics showed signiﬁcant Granger causalities in the network
(Table 1). Since the bi-directional Granger causalities exist, we
conclude that there is a feedback loop between neuron 1 and neuron
5. In the same way, we identiﬁed the other bi-directional couplings
between neurons (2,3), (3,4) and (2,4). At this stage, we do not
know whether the identiﬁed feedback loops are direct or indirect.
However, MSGCM can correctly discern the existence of feedback
loops between any pair of nodes. So, we can eventually identify all
direct or indirect feedback loops.

3.2 Comparison of MSGCM and NIRCM

For quantitative comparison of the efﬁcacies of MSGCM and
NIRCM, we applied both methods to the same synthetic pulsed
neural networks and compared their identiﬁcation results. We
simulated [with the same simulation protocol as detailed in the
Supplementary Material (Section 5)] a number of neural networks
of different sizes ranging from 6 to 20 nodes. Simulations were
performed using SRMs for realization of randomly connected

For each network scale, 100 randomly connected networks were tested using MSGCM and NIRCM.

networks where the synaptic efﬁcacies wl-j were randomly chosen
from a uniform distribution [—1, 1] [see Supplementary Material
(Section 3) for further details on SRM]. For in vitro cultured
neural networks, it has already been shown that each neuron
is mono-synaptically connected to 10—30% of all other neurons
at their matured phase and a matured inhibitory synaptic ratio
of all the synapses is about 10—20% (Jimbo et (11., 1999;
Marom and Shahaf, 2002). To mimic such in vitro cultured
neural networks, the structure of the simulated network was
randomly formed by keeping CR of 20% and ER of 90% [see
detailed deﬁnitions of CR and ER in the Supplementary Material
(Section 7)].

For each network size, 100 randomly connected networks were
tested for identiﬁcation of their feedback loops using the two
methods. For each n-node network, we judged whether the feedback
loop identiﬁcation is correct or not with respect to all pairs of nodes.
Then, for all the pairs of nodes (n(n— 1) /2 in total), we counted the
following four categorized cases: (1) the number of cases for correct
identiﬁcation of a feedback loop, ncf; (2) the number of cases for
correct identiﬁcation of no feedback loop, nonf; (3) the number of
cases for false-positive identiﬁcation of a feedback loop, nfp and (4)
the number of cases for false-negative identiﬁcation of no feedback
loop, nfn. Then, the ratio of correct identiﬁcations is deﬁned as
2(ncf+ncnf)/(n(n— 1)); the false-positive ratio as 2an/(n(n— 1))
and the false-negative ratio as 21th1 / (n(n— 1)). The means and SDs
of the deﬁned three ratios using two different methods were shown
in Table 2.

The simulation results showed that the correct identiﬁcation ratios
of MSGCM are always signiﬁcantly higher than those of NIRCM.
Both methods had a low level of means for false-positive and
false-negative ratios. The false-positive ratios of MSGCM were
signiﬁcantly less than those of NIRCM and the false-negative ratios
of MSGCM were slightly higher than those of NIRCM.

3.3 Investigation of feedback loops in cultured neural
networks

In previous sections, we showed the efﬁcacy of MSGCM in
identifying feedback loops in the artiﬁcial neuronal networks.
Then, we also investigated the presence of feedback loops in real
biological neural networks that spontaneously generate dynamical
behaviors. The experimental data were obtained from a MEA
(diameter 30 pm and spacing 200 pm) which can measure electrical
signals (extracellular spikes) present in in vitro hippocampal neural
networks (Eytan et (11 ., 2003, 2004; Marom and Shahaf, 2002; Shahaf
and Marom, 2001). A detailed experimental protocol is described in
the Supplementary Material (Section 6). Three 40 s segments of
spike trains obtained from three independent cultures (Cultures l—
3 with the same experimental protocols) were used to testify the
effectiveness of the proposed identiﬁcation method. Only 9 out of
total 60 channels had signiﬁcant spike responses (the numbers of
spikes are >10) in each culture. We excluded the channels showing
insigniﬁcant data containing <10 spikes. As a result, some feedback
loops were identiﬁed in the ﬁrst three cultures, as shown in Table 3.

Identification of feedback loops based on multi-step Granger causality

The age of each sample network is deﬁned by DIV (days in viva). Average SIs were calculated by averaging the 51s for all possible channel pairs in each culture with a time bin of
0.2 s; average burst rates (BR) are the counted number of bursts happening in per minutes for all nine channel data.

Culture 4 was a micro-island neuronal culture in an agarose micro-
well array (Kang et (11., 2009) in which all physical connections
between neurons were ‘cut off’ by the deliberate design. Then,
electrodes under Culture 4 recorded spike trains from completely
isolated neuronal circuits. Each electrode presented bursting activity
generated by a few neurons, but the activity was not able to propagate
through other electrodes due to the absence of biological connections
between the electrodes. Therefore, the resultant spike trains of each
electrode were affected by neurons from other electrodes. This was
conﬁrmed by applying MSGCM, as no feedback loop from Culture 4
was identiﬁed among 10 electrodes, as shown in Table 3. Therefore,
the identiﬁcation validated the feedback free cases in this non-
connective culture. We also tried to identify feedback loops in the
four cultures using NIRCM. The resulting identiﬁed feedback loops
are shown in Table 3.

Although the number of channels was similar in all experiments,
the identiﬁed feedback loops were different depending on the
temporal patterns of spike trains. In particular, the enrichment
of identiﬁed feedback loops was related to synchronized bursting
behaviors. To quantify the temporal relationship of a pair of
channels, the cross-correlation coefﬁcient of the two binned data
was deﬁned as a synchrony index (SI) (Sasaki et (11., 1989; Wylie
et (11., 1995). In this study, a sample correlation coefﬁcient was
calculated to approximate the cross-correlation coefﬁcient. Given
two binned data, x(k) and y(k) (k=l,2,...,L), then the sample
correlation coefﬁcient is as follows:

21:1(x(k>—3c>0(k>—y>
121:1(x(k>—3c>221=10(k>—y>2

 

 

rxy =

where it = %Z£=1x(k) and 3) = %Z£=1y(k). Average SIs were then
calculated by averaging the SIs for all possible pairs of channels in
each culture to evaluate the degree of synchronized behaviors. In the
raster plots of Cultures 1 and 2, we can ﬁnd apparent synchronized
oscillations among most of the electrodes (Fig. 3). This was also
indicated by high SI index in Table 3. For Culture 3, SI index was
signiﬁcantly smaller than Cultures 1 and 2 despite high burst rates.
These distinct behaviors were closely linked to the existence of a
feedback loop. A larger number of feedback loops were found from
Cultures 1 and 2 than Culture 3 (Table 3). As expected, Culture 4
did not show any synchrony due to the isolation of each electrode
indicating no identiﬁed feedback loop from the spike trains in
Culture 4.

Figure 4 shows two sets of feedback loops identiﬁed from
Cultures 1 and 3, respectively. We can see a distinct distribution
of feedback loops between these two cultures. Culture 1, presenting

4 CONCLUSION

In this study, we investigated the problem of identifying feedback
loops embedded in intra- or inter-cellular biological networks
using time-series measurements. Based on multivariate time-series
analysis, our proposed MSGCM can simultaneously analyze all
network variates in the process of identifying the feedback loops
from complicated biological networks. MSGCM can completely
decouple the correlations between a pair of examined variates
and the remaining variates in the network. This makes MSGCM
overcome the shortcoming of NIRCM since co-regulatory forward
paths always cause an input—output noise correlation. In this regard,
MSGCM is more advanced than NIRCM and suitable for complex
multivariate systems like biological networks. The application of
MSGCM and NIRCM to the same synthetic pulsed neural networks
showed that the correct identiﬁcation ratios of MSGCM are always
signiﬁcantly higher than those of NIRCM. Although MSGCM can
identify feedback loops of multivariate networks more accurately,
its computational complexity is higher than NIRCM. However,

locations on the MEA. The feedback loops were denoted by bi-directional
arrows. For Culture 1. 11 feedback loops were found. corresponding to a
synchronized oscillatory behavior. while for Culture 3. only 4 feedback loops
were found. related to a nearly random behavior

such complexity issues can be alleviated as high-performance
computation devices become more available.

In this study, we showed that MSGCM can successﬁllly
identify feedback loops in synthetic neural network models and in
vitro cultured neural networks. We also found that synchronized
oscillatory bursting behaviors were closely related to the existence
of feedback loops. From this ﬁnding, we infer that a feedback loop
might be an important network motif for the synchronized oscillatory
behavior in pulsed neural networks. In fact, the experiments using
in vitro cultured neural networks showed that the adjustment of
synaptic connections was highly correlated with the development
of neuronal network behaviors characterized by the evolvement of
spontaneous electrical activities of the network (Muramoto et (11.,
1993; Van Huizen et (11., 1985). An interesting phenomenon was
that the visibility of synchronized bursting behaviors was dependent
on the developing phase of the tested in vitro neuron cultures. In
vitro cultured neural networks showed spontaneous and uncorrelated
bursting activities in the beginning, but, after about six DIVs,
they exhibited abruptly a synchronized bursting activity (Habets
et (11., 1987). Then a question arises as to what triggered such an
emergent property in the cultured neural networks? The feedback
identiﬁcation method proposed in this study provides a very useﬁll
tool to infer a network motif responsible for this emergent property.
Previous studies indicated that developing neurons showed their
maximum synchronized activities at the 2nd or 3rd week of the brain
development (Habets et (11., 1987) and after that neuronal circuits
reached an optimal connectivity by pruning their connections (Van
Huizen et (11., 1985), i.e. undergoing an overall decline in the number
of synapses. We can also ﬁnd such a development trend by tracing
the variation of feedback loop abundance in Table 3 (the number
of feedback loops: 11 —> 22 —> 4 for DIV: 14 —> 18 —> 21). As
the networks are considered to be randomly connected, it would
be reasonable to presume that the abundance of feedback loops is
positively correlated with the whole network connectivity. Thus,
identifying feedback loops using MSGCM can also be validated
from this comparison.

Although we showed in this article the identiﬁcation of feedback
loops in cultured neural networks and investigations into the
relationship between the structure of a network and its dynamical
behavior, the presented approach can also be applied to studying
other biological networks based on time-series measurements using,
for example, real-time PCR (Heid et (11., 1996), immunoﬂuorescence

(Henle and Henle, 1966) and microarray (Schena et (11., 1995). If the
dynamical response of a biological network can be measured and
obtained in the form of multivariate time-series data, MSGCM can
be used to investigate the underlying causal feedback connections
in the network. For instance, recent advances in neural imaging
devices have provided enormous time-course data from the
brain. Examples include macroscopic electroencephalography and
magnetoencephalography signals recorded from the scalp, invasive
electrocorticography from the cortical surface and mesoscopic local
ﬁeld potential with electrodes inserted deep inside the brain. These
data have opened a new era for experimental studies on the detailed
wiring structure of a functional neural network (He et (11., 2011).
Most of the studies to date, however, have dealt with the functional
connectivity of a brain using simple correlation or effective
connectivity of a local brain region. MSGCM enables us to construct
a functional feedback network covering the whole brain regions and
to further project a brain network to a more precise interaction map
compared with previous studies. Our method can also be used as
a useful tool for examining the functional connectivity anomalies
occurring in patients with psychiatric disorders.

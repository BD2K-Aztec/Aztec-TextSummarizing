ABSTRACT

Motivation: The inference of regulatory networks from large-scale
expression data holds great promise because of the potentially
causal interpretation of these networks. However, due to the difficulty
to establish reliable methods based on observational data there is so
far only incomplete knowledge about possibilities and limitations of
such inference methods in this context.

Results: In this article, we conduct a statistical analysis investigating
differences and similarities of four network inference algorithms,
ARACNE, CLR, MRNET and RN, with respect to local network-based
measures. We employ ensemble methods allowing to assess the
inferability down to the level of individual edges. Our analysis reveals
the bias of these inference methods with respect to the inference
of various network components and, hence, provides guidance in
the interpretation of inferred regulatory networks from expression
data. Further, as application we predict the total number of regulatory
interactions in human B cells and hypothesize about the role of Myc
and its targets regarding molecular information processing.

1 INTRODUCTION

The orchestral behavior of genes is coordinated by different types
of gene networks, e.g. the transcriptional regulatory, signaling or
protein network and interactions among them (Barabasi and Oltvai,
2004; Palsson, 2006). As these networks represent biochemical
interactions among gene products, they form causal (Pearl, 2000;
Shipley, 2000) instead of merely association networks (Zhang and
Horvath, 2005). For this reason the reconstruction of gene networks
from experimental data on a genomic scale is considered as one
of the most important goals in systems biology. A reﬂection of
this importance can be seen in the establishment of the DREAM
(Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods)
project and its conference series that is devoted to all aspects of
this endeavor providing a forum for the community (Stolovitzky
and Califano, 2007; Stolovitzky et (11., 2009).

If expression data from DNA microarray experiments are used,
the inferred networks are called gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
because a large portion of estimated interactions may come from

transcription regulation directly, but not only (Emmert-Streib and
Dehmer, 2008; Levine et (11., 2005). In general, GRN inference
(GRNI) is important for a better understanding of normal cell
physiology and for the explanation of pathological phenotypes
(Almudevar et (11., 2006; Emmert-Streib, 2007). The difﬁculty of the
problem (Hache et (11., 2009; Holland, 1986; Margolin and Califano,
2007; Werhli et (11., 2006) stems from the fact that expression data
are noisy, sample size is small relative to the number of covariates
and the type of data is frequently limited to observational data only,
e.g. because of ethical reasons.

Recently, several mutual information (MI; Cover and Thomas,
1991) based methods for the inference of genome-scale regulatory
networks have been suggested to approach this problem. Four
of these methods are ARACNE (Margolin et (11., 2006), CLR
(Faith et (11., 2007), MRNET (Meyer et (11., 2007) and Relevance
Networks (RN; Butte and Kohane, 2000). These methods have
been investigated using global performance measures such as
the F -score (Meyer et (11., 2007) or area under the receiver
operator curve (AUROC) (Husmeier, 2003). Further, such studies
are frequently based on an individual dataset rather than an ensemble
of datasets drawn under the same condition. In this article, we
analyze network inference methods statistically employing local
network-based measures to assess their performance, as proposed
in Emmert-Streib and Altay (2010), in combination with ensemble
data. This introduces a graph-theoretical perspective (Chartrand and
Oellermann, 1993) on the problem that allows to study arbitrary
network components instead of the entire network only.

2 APPROACH

In this article, we aim to compare four different network inference
algorithms (ARACNE, CLR, MRNET and RN) by using local
network-based measures for their assessment. In Emmert-Streib and
Altay (2010), several general local network-based measures have
been introduced studying various synthetic and one real biological
network from Escherichia coli. It was demonstrated that these
measures allow an exploratory analysis of inference algorithms on
the level of network components, e.g. edges, motifs or subnetworks.
This means, in the ﬁnest resolution, e.g. true positive rates (TPRs)
of individual edges, instead of entire networks, can be investigated.
In this study, we apply the local network-based measures introduced
in Emmert-Streib and Altay (2010) and complement them with
additional ones. As a practical application of the results obtained
by our approach, in combination with results from a previous study
(Basso et (11., 2005), we estimate the total number of regulatory
interactions in human B cells and hypothesize about the role of Myc

with respect to the hierarchical organization (Ma et (11., 2004; Yu
and Gerstein, 2006) of this regulatory network.

3 METHODS

Our comparative analysis of network inference algorithms utilizes local
network-based measures (Emmert-Streib and Altay, 2010). These measures
assume the availability of an ensemble of datasets D: {D1(G), . . . ,DE(G)},
instead of just a single one, belonging to the same underlying structure
of a gene network G. More precisely, for the following analysis we use a
subnetwork of the transcriptional regulatory network of Yeast (Guelzim et (11.,
2002), G, consisting of 100 genes. This subnetwork was randomly sampled
from the entire transcriptional regulatory network by using SynTReN
(Van den Bulcke et (11., 2006). From this network, expression data in steady-
state condition are obtained by using dynamic equations with Michaelisi
Menten and Hill enzyme kinetics. These data are generated with SynTReN
(Van den Bulcke et (11., 2006). In total, we generate E = 300 different datasets
for sample size 200 and another E 2300 datasets for sample size 20 using
the same subnetwork G of the transcriptional regulatory network of yeast but
with different kinetic parameters for each dataset. Biologically, the data D
may correspond to a population of one species spanning the whole dynamic
range that different individual organisms from the same species can exhibit.
The reason for this variability comes from the fact that molecular systems
behave unlike a clockwork utilizing parallel pathways for inter- and intra-
cell communication. Statistically, using one network structure G underlying
the ensemble data allows the statistical assessment of network components
down to the level of individual edges. If different networks, G, 75 Gj for i #j,
would be used for different datasets D,»(G,») for i e {1, . . . ,E}, the identiﬁcation
of such network components would be no longer possible and, hence, an
averaging over different datasets would become meaningless. For example,
given two networks of the same size, there may be an edge connecting
gene In and n in the ﬁrst network but no edge in the second network. This
demonstrates the problem to identify common parts in these networks. If
instead of mathematical labels, m and n, the nodes in these networks would
be labeled with gene names, this problem would become more apparent.

The network inference algorithms that we compare in this study are
ARACNE, CLR, MRNET and RNs. For detailed information about these
GRNI algorithms considered in this study, we refer the readers to Butte
and Kohane (2000), Faith et a1. (2007), Margolin et a1. (2006) and Meyer
et a1. (2007, 2008). For ARACNE, we set the data processing inequality
(DPI; Cover and Thomas, 1991) tolerance parameter 620.1, as in Basso
et a1. (2005). The M1 values are estimated using non-parametric Gaussian
estimator as described in Meyer et a1. (2008) and Olsen et a1. (2009). The
optimal cutoff value for each dataset, Di, used to declare edges signiﬁcant is
obtained by maximizing the F -score,

17(16)+ r06)-

Here the F -score, F (16), precision, p(I(’))=TP/(TP + FF) and recall,
r(I(’))=TP/(TP + FN), are a function of the MI threshold 16 [CLR uses z scores
instead (Faith et (11., 2007)] and so are the number of true positive (TP), false
positive (FF) and false negative (FN) edges (see the Supplementary Material
for more details). This results in E different F -scores, correspondingly E
inferred networks, for the ensemble D={D1(G),...,DE(G)} for a given
sample size. For the following simulations, we use data of sample sizes
20 and 200. The overview block diagram of our approach is shown in the
Supplementary Figure 1.

Despite the fact that the main objective of this article is to investigate
local network-based measures, we use one global measure, the F -score, not
only to ﬁnd a common ground to traditional approaches to this problem, but
also to investigate the variability of this measure by using an ensemble of
datasets. In conventional studies, only one dataset is used resulting in one,
e.g. F -score. However, as we will see in Section 4 one value is usually no
good representation of the underlying population. From many simulations,

F06) = (1)

also using the AUROC, we found that the quality of this statement is not
sensitive to the actual global measure. For this reason, we present only results
for the F -score because it seems sufﬁcient for our argument.

The conceptional idea that motivated the introduction of local network-
based measures is to categorize network components according to a given
rule. For example, we might categorize edges in different classes according
to a graph-theoretical description that is solely based on the network topology
of the regulatory network. Or we could categorize edges according to their
effect sign as given by the dynamical equations generating the expression
data. An example for the ﬁrst measure, in the following called D5, is a function
of the degrees of the edge enclosing genes whereas an example for the second
is the categorization in activator and repressor edges. It is apparent that there
are many more measures that can be constructed based on your guiding idea.
One further measure we study in the following, besides individual edges, is
based on three-gene motifs because it has been recognized that such motifs
are functional building blocks of larger networks (Milo et (11., 2002). All these
network-based measures emphasize one speciﬁc aspect, either of the network
topology or of the dynamical equations. However, collectively they allow to
gather multidimensional information that can be used to evaluate inference
methods. Formal details of our measures and their deﬁning rules can be found
in the Supplementary Material or in Emmert-Streib and Altay (2010).

4 RESULTS

We begin our analysis of the four inference algorithms by comparing
three global measures. The results are shown in Figure 1. In this
ﬁgure, the number 20 (respectively 200) indicates the sample size.
By maximizing the F -score for each of the E datasets, we obtain the
optimal MI threshold (cutoff) values 10, respectively 10, illustrated
in Figure 1A. From this ﬁgure, one can see that CLR results in much
higher cutoff values, 10, than the other algorithms. That is why we
plotted these results separately. The average MI (z for CLR) values
for each edge of the true network G (averaged over E datasets) are
illustrated in Figure 1C. Figure 1B shows the maximal F -scores
for the E datasets. This ﬁgure shows that, statistically, on a global
basis and sample size 200, MRNET having a median F -score of
~0.45 is signiﬁcantly better than the other methods: ARACNE with
a median F-score ~0.38, CLR ~0.32 and RN ~0.28. For sample
size 20, the median F-scores are: CLR ~0.33, MRNET ~0.32,
ARACNE ~0.29 and RN ~0.28. When the sample size is smaller,
the performance of the GRNI algorithms becomes comparable. It is
also worth mentioning that MRNET and ARACNE increase their
performance signiﬁcantly by increasing the sample size, while the
other methods are only moderately affected with respect to the
median value of the F -score.

In the remainder of this section, we study local network-based
performance measures. The ﬁrst measure we use investigates the
inﬂuence of activator (positive effect) and repressor (negative effect)
edges. In Figure 2, we show histograms, for sample size 200, to
visualize the effect of activator (red) and repressor (blue) edges on
the TPR of edges for all GRNI algorithms under investigation. The
TPR of an edge is the number of times a speciﬁc edge is inferred
correctly divided by the total number of datasets (E). A brief
overview of this measure is given in the Supplementary Material.
To investigate the results in Figure 2 quantitatively, we apply a two-
sample Kolmogorov—Smirnov test (Sheskin, 2004), to each GRNI
algorithm, for testing differences in the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of activator and repressor edges. For sample size
200, we obtain P-values of 0.0009688, 0.001554, 0.0001145 and
3.432 X 10—6 for ARACNE, CLR, MRNET and RN, respectively.
The results suggest that, for a signiﬁcance level of (1:001, the

edge type has a systematic effect on all four inference algorithms.
Qualitatively, this can be seen from the histograms in Figure 2 where
the repressor edges have a higher TPR, which means that they are
easier to infer. For sample size 20, we obtain P-values of 0.1097,
0.00823, 0.08638 and 4.726 ><10_5 for ARACNE, CLR, MRNET
and RN, respectively. These results indicate that only CLR and RN
are systematically affected by the edge type. In summary, this means
that not only the used inference algorithm may introduce a bias in
this context but also the sample size.

The next network-based measure, D5, that we use allows us to
categorize edges in more than two classes as for the activator and
repressor edges. The measure Dsl-J~ is deﬁned as the sum of the out-
degree of node 1' plus the in-degree of node j (Emmert-Streib and
Altay, 2010) (for a more detailed description see the Supplementary
Material). In Figure 3, we illustrate the relation between mean
TPR (W) and D5 for sample size 200. In order to quantitatively
investigate whether there is a systematic effect of D5 on W, we
apply an one-factor ANOVA test to test for equal means of W

for each GRNI algorithm. ANOVA tests give P-values of 0.002016,
1.56 X 10_7, 0.4053 and 0.874 for ARACNE, CLR, MRNET and
RN, respectively. For a signiﬁcance level of at =0.01, CLR and
ARACNE show a signiﬁcant heterogeneous behavior of W with
respect to D5. This suggests that W is signiﬁcantly affected by the
value of D5. On the other hand, the results do not suggest a systematic
dependence of W on DS for MRNET and RN. For a sample size
of 20 (Supplementary Fig. 2), the ANOVA tests give P-values of
5.182 ><10_6, 1.814 X 10—8, 6.714 ><10_5 and 0.811 forARACNE,
CLR, MRNET and RN, respectively. This suggests that, for at = 0.01,
ARACNE, CLR and MRNET show a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of D5 on
W whereas RN does not. For an appropriate interpretation of the
shown error bars in Figure 3, the reader is referred to the histogram
of D5 counts provided in Supplementary Figure 3.

The next network-based measure evaluates the inferability of
basic motif types that consists of four different three-gene motifs,
as shown in Supplementary Figure 5. In Table 1, we present the
results for these four network motifs for sample size 200, providing
their mean true reconstruction rate 13 and its SD (7(13). The mean true
reconstruction rate, e.g. for motif of types 1,2 and 3 is given by
averaging

p: %(TPR(A<—>B)+TPR(B <—>C)+TNR(A¢L>C)). (2)

over all motifs of the same type within the network (Emmert-Streib
and Altay, 2010). More details about this measure are given in
the Supplementary Material. From the table we can observe that
all algorithms behave similarly with respect to the inferability for
these network motifs, favoring motif types 1 and 3. The mean true
reconstruction rate for motif type 4 is consistently the worst for all
four methods. A general explanation for this behavior (different 13
values for different motif types) seems not to be straight forward.
However, assuming a homogeneous TPR for an edge of 0.17 (as
implied by motif type 4) and an idealized true negative rate (TNR)
of 1.0 for a non-edge would result in, e.g. for motif type 1 or 2,

13:0.45: (2 X 1.0+ 0. 17)/3. This value would be an upper bound
that cannot be exceeded because a TNR of 1.0 is the highest possible
value. However, as one can see from Table 1 all 13 values for motif
types 1 and 3 are larger than 0.45. Hence, the actual situation is more
intricate implying a complex dependency structure. For sample size
20, we observe results that are qualitatively similar to the results
discussed above (Supplementary Table 1). These results suggest that
there is no bias introduced by the inference algorithms regarding the
inferability of individual motif types (compare columns in Table 1);
however, each algorithm is biased toward motif types 1 and 2
(compare rows in Table 1).

In order to compare the estimations of motif types with real
biological data, we apply our measure to one of the DREAM datasets
(DREAM2, Challange 5, Genome-Scale Network Inference). This
dataset consists of 520 Affymetrix arrays from E.coli (Faith et (11.,
2007). Comparison of the results for CLR and CLR (EC) (Table 1)
reveals that the results from our simulations are well conﬁrmed.
Speciﬁcally, motif type 4 is by far the most difﬁcult one to infer.
Interestingly, from the number of motifs present, #m, one can
see that these are quite different to the subnetwork of yeast we
used for our simulations; still, the general inferability of different
motif types remains similar. This indicates that for simulations to
provide meaningful results it is not necessary to know the underlying
network with arbitrary precision but meeting basic characteristics
seem to be sufﬁcient. This demonstrates that our approach results
in good estimates of the inferability of motif types with a GRNI
algorithm for real biological data.

Finally, we investigate the behavior of individual edges, which
is the ﬁnest resolution one can achieve with any measure. We start
with an overview of these results in Figure 4 showing the boxplots
of the MI values for TP, FN and FF, TN edges with respect to the
true network G.1 From these boxplots in Figure 4, one sees that for
all inference methods the highest MI values of TP edges are in the

the true network structure.

In Figure 5, we show a visualization of the mean TPR of edges
in the true network for MRNET (Fig. 5A) and CLR (Fig. 5B)—
corresponding results for ARACNE and RN can be in found in
Supplementary Figure 4. The color code of the edges corresponds to
their mean TPR. Speciﬁcally, for black edges, 1 3ﬁ> 0.75; for
blue edges, 0.75 3ﬁ> 0.5; for green edges, 0.5 3ﬁ> 0.25;
and for red edges, 0.253ﬁ300. A visual inspection of these
ﬁgures suggests that there might be a systematic inﬂuence of in-hubs
and leafs on the inferability as reﬂected by the color of edges. Here,
an in-hub is deﬁned as a gene that has more than three incoming
edges. We term these incoming edges as in-hub edges. A leaf node
is a terminal gene that has exactly one incoming edge. We call this
edge leaf edge. In order to quantify this observation, we provide
a summary in Table 2. For each of the four algorithms, we count
the number of leaf edges (leaf #) and in-hub edges (in-hub #) with
respect to the occurrence of red, green, blue and black edges (as
deﬁned above). For example, for RN we ﬁnd a total of E L = 41 leaf
edges of which six are green corresponding to 14.6% with respect
to EL. Further, these six green edges represent 50% of all 12 green
edges found with respect to the entire network (Net). One can see
from this table that in general the probability to observe blue or
black leaf edges is much higher than to observe red or green leaf
edges, whereas for the in-hub edges this situation is reversed. This
implies a systematic bias for all four algorithms.

From our results presented in Table 2 follows an immediate
application if combined with results for experimental expression
data supposing that the assumptions made for our analysis
extrapolate to real data. ARACNE has been applied to expression
data from human B cells (Basso et (11., 2005). The inferred regulatory
network consisted of ~129.000 edges (Basso et (11., 2005). Using
our simulation results, we predict from this that the inferred network
constitutes only of about 29.9% of the total number of interactions
present in the regulatory network of a B cell. That means the
predicted total number of all interactions is about 431.000.2 This
is a conservative estimate that should be considered as a lower
bound of the total number of regulatory interactions because of two
reasons. First, we did not only consider black (21.1%) but also blue
(8.8%) edges. Second, in our simulations we did not estimate a
cutoff value 10 for the declaration of signiﬁcant MI values from the
data but by using the true network structure. This gives an optimal
cutoff value resulting in the best performance possible. For estimated
cutoff values, the percentages for blue and black edges can only be
smaller and, hence, the predicted number of total interaction would
increase.

We conduct a similar investigation for non-edges. This term refers
to the absence of a regulatory interaction in the true network G. A
summary of our results is shown in Table 3. From this table, one
can see that the TNR is not only highest for MRNET but close
to perfect because only three non-edges belong to 12. ARACNE
is slightly worse but also gives very good results. CLR and RN
perform worst meaning that their TNR is lowest and the number
of non-edges belonging to 12,13 or 14 is highest. This indicates
that there are several non-edges that may very frequently lead to
wrong declarations (FP edges) regardless of the used dataset. Hence,
even if one would utilize an ensemble of datasets, this would not

network-based measures in combination with ensemble simulations
allowing a detailed analysis down to the level of individual edges.
This is the highest resolution achievable. The main purpose of our
investigation was not only to reveal the general performance of these
methods with respect to the studied novel measures but also to
gain insights into a possible bias of these methods. For example,
our ﬁnding that repressor edges are easier to infer for all four
algorithms than activator edges means that the regulatory networks
inferred by these methods do systematically discriminate activating
interactions. Hence, an interpretation of the inferred networks in
biological terms should take this bias into account to avoid spurious
conclusions that are in fact induced by the working mechanism of
the employed method. We found similar results for network motifs
consisting of three genes. Also for these measures all four algorithms

to leaf genes suggests its decentral character, or Myc is central
suggesting either a non-hierarchical organization of the network or
the existence of genes that behave non-hierarchical in an otherwise
hierarchically organized system. If the latter case is true this might
be an indicator of a network characteristics that remained so far
covert.

A ﬁirther prediction that we can make relates to the direction of
interactions. Again, based on our results in Table 2, we predict that
edges should be oriented toward leaf genes making, e.g. Myc the
source of outgoing edges. Due to the fact that Myc is a transcription
factor, this appears compelling. However, we want to emphasize
that our methods employed in this article are not familiar with
the semantics of transcription factor, making such a prediction not
straight forward for a theoretical method.

For the experimental design of the inference of regulatory
networks from expression data (Margolin and Califano, 2007)
follow at least two suggestions from our results. First, despite
the fact that we studied four different inference methods that
have been introduced separately, we demonstrated, by usage of

motif statistics (Table 1), that they behave quantitatively similar.
A possible explanation may be that these methods have in common
to be based on bivariate estimates of MI, not considering higher
orders thereof. For this reason, it seems sensible to study multivariate
informations in combination with our measures to improve certain
regulatory combinations that are by current methods systematically
discriminated. Although the extension to motifs involving more than
three genes is straight forward, the interpretation of these results
guiding the design of n-variate information may be intricate. For
this reason, we suggest focusing ﬁrst on three-gene motifs and
corresponding information measures. Second, it would be interesting
to study differences between observational and interventional
data with respect to, e.g. motif statistics. Speciﬁcally, it would
be beneﬁcial for ﬁiture experiments to understand what parts
of the regulatory network can or cannot be inferred well from
observations data only, respectively, from interventional data, to
identify an optimal combination of both data types balancing
performance and economic constraints. Hence, our study may
contribute complementing recent results from DREAM (Stolovitzky
and Califano, 2007; Stolovitzky et al., 2009) by introducing a
novel network-based perspective that may not only help to evaluate
methods but also to guide the design of novel statistical estimators.
This discussion underlines the importance of sound simulation
studies in order to obtain meaningful interpretations of the inferred
networks. Also, as demonstrated with our discussion about Myc
and human B cells, such studies enable practical predictions and
intriguing hypotheses about the intricate working mechanism of
biological pathways and their underlying information processing.

6 CONCLUSION

Despite the wealth of literature already existing studying network
inference algorithms, our study is the ﬁrst comparing such
algorithms with respect to local network-based measures in
combination with ensemble methods. By emphasizing network
based and ensemble, we want to point out, ﬁrst, measures should be
problem speciﬁc, in contrast to general measures such as the F -score,
allowing to gain domain-speciﬁc insights in the underlying problem.
Second, the overall problem of network inference should be put
in the context of statistical inference to gain reliable information
about the performance and especially errors of such methods under
well-deﬁned conditions.

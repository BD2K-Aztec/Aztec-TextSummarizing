ABSTRACT

Motivation: Resource description framework (RDF) is an emerging
technology for describing, publishing and linking life science data.
As a major provider of bioinformatics data and services, the
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) is committed to making data
readily accessible to the community in ways that meet existing
demand. The EBI RDF platform has been developed to meet an
increasing demand to coordinate RDF activities across the institute
and provides a new entry point to querying and exploring integrated
resources available at the EBI.

1 INTRODUCTION

The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) is the largest
bioinformatics resource provider in Europe. Our databases are
accessible Via dedicated interfaces, web services, data download
and (in a few cases) direct database access. Modern research in
the life sciences necessitates an understanding of data at many
different levels: multi-omics, from cells to biological systems,
across many different species and studying many different experi-
mental conditions. The biology underpinning these research
questions is intrinsically connected, yet data are often collected
and stored in technology or domain-speciﬁc repositories.

Efforts in the Semantic Web community are already beginning
to invest in technology that enables data to be readily integrated
(Belleau et al., 2008; Katayama et al., 2010; Marshall et al.,
2008). One method used among the Semantic Web community
is using the W3C’s resource description framework (RDF) model
to represent data. RDF provides a common mechanism for
describing data and querying data using SPARQL.

To better serve complex research questions across resources,
and to meet an increased demand on the EBI to produce RDF,
we have developed an RDF platform. The aim of such a plat-
form is to offer users the ability to ask questions using multiple
connected resources that share common identiﬁers and have a

common format (RDF) and query interface (SPARQL). This
platform complements other existing data access modes such as
our Web site and RESTful web services, but additionally con-
tains explicit links between the different data resources. This
enables a single query to be asked across multiple distributed
datasets and across a range of biological domains. This approach
has been applied for the following EBI resources: Gene Expres-
sion Atlas (Kapushesky et al., 2012), ChEMBL (Gaulton et al.,
2011), BioModels (Li et al., 2010), Reactome (Matthews et al.,
2008), BioSamples (Gostev et al., 2012) and also includes a col-
laboration with the UniProt Consortium to deliver UniProt
RDF (Redaschi and UniProt Consortium, 2009).

2 METHODS

The RDF platform presents a coordinated effort to bring together RDF
resources from multiple services and databases at the EBI. The develop-
ment of the platform began by collecting requirements from both a
scientiﬁc and a technical perspective. The scientiﬁc requirements were
gathered as a series of use cases and competency questions collected
from research scientists and users of EBI services. In particular, we
were looking for questions that required data to be integrated from mul-
tiple resources and that are not trivial to answer with our existing infra-
structure due to the disparate nature of the data. These questions were
used to identify points of integration between resources. The scientiﬁc use
cases informed the technical requirements on what infrastructure, in
terms of both software and hardware, would be needed to deliver a
stable and scalable platform. Given RDF technology is still maturing,
there are open questions on how to deliver such a platform on this scale;
our existing infrastructure is delivered after evaluation of various tech-
nologies that will be the subject of another paper.

Data from UniProt, ChEMBL, Reactome and BioModels represents
curated knowledge from protein sequence and function, bio-active mol-
ecules and their targets, to biochemical pathways and computational
models of molecular interactions. The Gene Expression Atlas database
provides differential gene expression data from a variety of samples that
are highly annotated and curated using the Experimental Factor Ontology
(EFO) (Malone et al., 2010). Generating linked RDF for these resources
provides a new entry point for exploring the data, such as putting gene
expression in the context of protein function, pathways and drug targets.
An outline of how resources are connected is shown in Figure 1.

The graph-based nature of the RDF data model provides a natural ﬁt
for explicitly publishing how data are connected. In RDF, resources are
identiﬁed using uniform resource identiﬁers (URIs), which provide a
web-based global identiﬁcation system. Guidelines for minting new
URIs for EBI resources were established using the new rdfebi.ac.ul<

Fig. 1. Connections between services (boxes) and ontologies (circles). The
graph illustrates how the data are linked within the RDF platform,
enabling queries to span all data. Asterisk: ENSEMBL to UniProt
(gray line) mappings are included via expression atlas

domain (details can be found at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/documentation/
uris-ebi-data). Canonical URIs are used when existing databases, such as
UniProt, already provide stable URIs. In cases where no canonical URIs
are provided by external resources, the Identiﬁersorg registry of scientiﬁc
identiﬁers (Juty et al., 2012) was used to provide a referencing URI. As
part of the URI strategy, every effort has been made to ensure all EBI
RDF datasets only use URIs that can be dereferenced using http, sup-
porting content negotiation for human-orientated HTML views, along-
side machine processable versions in various RDF syntaxes.

Using common URI schemes assists data integration with RDF. In
addition, ontologies provide a mechanism to semantically describe the
data, and the OWL ontology language can be serialized in RDF. The EBI
makes extensive use of ontologies to annotate data, however, the richness
of these annotations is rarely available in native RDF for exploitation by
external applications. The EBI RDF platform adopts a range of common
vocabularies and ontologies to annotate data. The ontologies used span
common biomedical terminologies such as the Gene Ontology, Chemical
Entities of Biological Interest, UBERON, Cell Type Ontology, Biological
Pathways Exchange, EFO and more. Additionally, we adopted metadata
standards for describing datasets and provenance such as Dublin Core,
Data Catalog Vocabulary and Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets.

3 RESULTS

Complete dumps of the RDF data are available Via FTP down-
loads. These are published in line with existing production and
release cycles, ensuring the most up-to-date data are readily avail-
able. We are also using triple store technology to index the RDF
ﬁles and make them available for querying and exploration Via
SPARQL endpoints and our linked data browser. The underlying
infrastructure at the EBI is built on open source triple store tech-
nology provided by OpenLink, (http://www.openlinksw.com/),
whereas the UniProt data are served by the SIB’s Vital-IT HPC
platform using technology from OntoText (http://www.ontotext.
com/). We developed LODEStar (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fgpt/sw/
lodestar/) as a generic SPARQL endpoint and linked data brow-
ser to provide a consistent interface and some enhanced function-
ality for querying and browsing EBI-based datasets.

In addition to providing access to the underlying data, an
equally important component of the platform is the Web site
at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf that provides an entry point to dis-
cover all RDF resources being served by the EBI. This site in-
cludes documentation on how to find the datasets and provides
examples of how to query the data using the SPARQL endpoints
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/example-sparql-queries). We also pro-
vide examples showing developers how they can use the
SPARQL API programmatically from common programming
environments like Perl, Java and R.

4 CONCLUSION

The EBI RDF platform allows explicit links to be made between
datasets using shared semantics from standard ontologies and
vocabularies, facilitating a greater degree of data integration.
SPARQL provides a standard query language for querying
RDF data. Data that have been annotated using ontologies,
such as EFO and the Gene Ontology, enable data integration
with other community datasets and provides the semantics to
perform rich queries. Publishing these datasets as RDF along
with their ontologies provides both the syntactic and semantic
integration of data long promised by semantic web technologies.

As the trend toward publishing life science data in RDF in-
creases, we anticipate a rise in the number of applications con-
suming such data. This is evident in efforts such as the Open
PHACTS platform (http://www.openphacts.org) and the
AtlasRDF-R package (https://github.com/jamesmalone/
AtlasRDF-R). Our aim is that the EBI RDF platform enables
such applications to be built by releasing production quality ser-
vices with semantically described RDF to enable pertinent bio-
medical use cases to be addressed.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) share similar
secondary and tertiary topology, but their primary sequence identity
is low. Computational identification of ligand-binding residues
allows biologists to better understand the protein—carbohydrate
binding mechanism. In general, functional characterization can be
alternatively solved by alignment-based manners. As alignment
accuracy based on conventional methods is often sensitive to
sequence identity, low sequence identity among query sequences
makes it difficult to precisely locate small portions of relevant
features. Therefore, we propose a feature-incorporated alignment
(FIA) to flexibly align conserved signatures in CBMs. Then, an FlA-
based target-template prediction model was further implemented to
identify functional ligand-binding residues.

Results: Arabidopsis thaliana CBM45 and CBM53 were used to
validate the FlA-based prediction model. The predicted ligand-
binding residues residing on the surface in the hypothetical structures
were verified to be ligand-binding residues. In the absence of 3D
structural information, FlA demonstrated significant improvement in
the estimation of sequence similarity and identity for a total of 808
sequences from 11 different CBM families as compared with six
leading tools by Friedman rank test.

1 INTRODUCTION

Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are deﬁned as a set of
protein domains capable of recognizing and binding polysaccharide
ligands. With the exception of some lectins and sugar transport
proteins, most CBMs mediate the interaction between the substrate
and the enzyme, which in turn increases local substrate concentration
at the active site of the catalytic domain (Southall et (11.,
1999). CBMs are protein domains sharing low sequence identities
that possess conserved structure topology. Up to now, CBMs
have been classiﬁed into 59 families (still growing) by CAZy

database (http://www.cazy.org/). Among these families, CBM20,
CBM21, CBM25, CBM26, CBM34, CBM41, CBM45, CBM48
and CBM53 are reported to possess starch-binding activity. The
most recent review comprehensively introduces the importance of
functions and structures of CBM20 (Christiansen et (11., 2009). The
primary sequence identities of CBM families are low; however,
bioinformatics analysis suggests that some CBMs constitute a CBM
Clan such as CBM20s, CBM2ls, CBM48s and CBM53s. A better
understanding of ligand-binding residues in CBMs can boost protein
engineering for industrial development in food processing and
biofuel production (Guzman-Maldonado and Paredes-Lopez, 1995;
Schmidt and Dauenhauer, 2007).

To predict ligand-binding residues in a protein domain, protein-
ligand docking programs are typically applied to simulate the
binding site of a target protein relative to a ligand conformation
and orientation. In general, docking programs require precise atom
coordinate information to calculate the optimal geometric pose
under stereo-Chemical restraints and are usually based on certain
criteria such as binding afﬁnity and minimal free energy (Thomsen
and Christensen, 2006; Yang and Chen, 2004). Nevertheless, the
time complexity of the optimized procedure is extremely high
such that docking programs are commonly solved by heuristic
algorithms like the genetic algorithm. Besides, real protein—ligand
interactions always involve conformational change. When the
structural ﬂexibility is also taken into account, the computational
complexity becomes prohibitively complicated. Furthermore,
although more than 10.1 million protein sequences are currently
available in UniProtKB/TrEMBL database (Boutet et (11., 2007), as
of January 2010, only 62 926 protein structures have been deposited
in Protein Data Bank (Berman et (11., 2007). Thus, the number of
resolved protein structures is far behind that of protein sequences.
In reality, it is expensive and time consuming to resolve a protein
structure and non-productive to determine all protein structures.
Nevertheless, the lack of a resolved protein structure does not hinder
researchers from identifying crucial ﬁmctional residues governing
reaction mechanisms. When tertiary structural information is not
available, it is still possible to predict ligand-binding residues from
sequence alone. Recently, some pure sequence-based prediction
methodologies applied sequence alignment to generate a column of
conserved residues and calculated the residue conservation score
based on training with known functional residues (Capra and Singh,
2007; Chen and Jeong, 2009; Fischer et (11., 2008). In terms of

Prediction and verification of ligand-binding residue

 

alignment implementation, the global optimal pairwise alignment
can be solved in 0(n2), where n stands for the length of the longer
sequence (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). In the last decades, the
most widely used alignment programs were heuristic or approximate
based on different improvement techniques. Among them, ClustalW
is designed mainly based on gap penalty adjustments (Larkin et (11.,
2007). T-COFFEE constructs an alignment library by weighting
the consistency of ClustalW (global alignment) and Lalign (local
alignment) (Notredame et (11., 2000). MUSCLE ﬁrst constructs a
draft alignment, and then reﬁnes it using a variant of tree-dependent
restricted partitioning (Edgar, 2004). DIALIGN-TX identiﬁes local
alignments with ungapped segment comparisons to greedily evolve
a multiple alignment (Subramanian et (11., 2008). ProbCons utilizes
an assortment of probabilistic modeling and consistency-based
alignment techniques to increase alignment accuracy (Do et (11.,
2005). MAFFT applies fast Fourier transform to rapidly locate
homologous regions and simpliﬁes the scoring ﬁinction to reduce
computational time (Katoh et (11., 2002). Generally speaking, among
these six mentioned tools, ProbCons achieves the highest accuracy
and MUSCLE is the most efﬁcient on BAliBASE, a standard
alignment benchmark for various sequence properties (Bahr et (11.,
2001).

However, one common deﬁciency in sequence alignment is
that the alignment accuracy relies heavily on sequence identity
(Yang and Honig, 1999). Low sequence identity implies that only
few positions are conserved and thus difﬁcult to be recognized.
Moreover, a simpliﬁed mathematic model may not reﬂect the real
complicated biological model. Therefore, instead of designing a
generalized model, biologists are concerned about the functionally
meaningful features. Previous studies show that hydrophobic
stacking interactions of aromatic residues and hydrogen bonding
of polar amino acids in CBMs confer essential roles in ligand-
binding recognition (Boraston et (11., 2004; Pell et (11., 2003;
Ponyi et (11., 2000; Xie et (11., 2001), and secondary structure is
the core topology conserved in CBMs. Therefore, based on the
observations of the conserved features in CBM families, we ﬁrst
designed a feature-incorporated alignment (FIA) to ﬂexibly anchor
aromatic residues with adjacent polar residues with ﬂ-stranded
structures as the most conserved features. Based on FIA, we further
developed a ligand-binding residue prediction system employing
the target-template comparison model. Our contributions are 2-fold:
superior alignment accuracy and a pure sequence-based prediction
model for in silico identiﬁcation of ligand-binding residues in
CBMs.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 System overview

The central idea of the proposed ligand-binding residue prediction model
was to locate key conserved secondary structure elements and aromatic
residues in CBM families. FIA was designed to ﬂexibly anchor aromatic
residues with adjacent polar residues and ﬁ-stranded structures. In addition,
annotated sequences with reported ligand-binding residues were adopted
as templates to detect the conserved ligand-binding residue in the target
sequence. The proposed ligand-binding residue prediction system for CBM
families can be divided into four modules as depicted in Figure 1. The ﬁrst
two steps are preprocesses to predict secondary structures and to annotate
the aromatic amino acids with adjacent polar residues. The last two detecting
stages are applied for pairwise alignment of the target sequence against the

annotated sequences and to evaluate the aligned aromatic residues in the
target sequence.

2.2 Predicting secondary structure by discrimination
of protein secondary structure class

Secondary structures are better conserved than loop regions in a tertiary
structure, and the ﬁ-stranded element is a key conserved structure topology in
CBM families (Hashimoto, 2006). These features serve as a good constraint
core segment in sequence alignment. Therefore, we applied Discrimination
of protein Secondary structure Class (DSC) (King and Sternberg, 1996). DSC
achieved overall three-state accuracy of 70. 1% and performed best in enzyme
size of 907170 kDa. DSC predicts the probabilities of an amino acid in a loop,
a-helix and ﬁ-sheet for primary sequences. When the reported probability of
an amino acid in a ﬁ-sheet was higher than 60%, the amino acid would be
annotated as ‘in ﬁ-strand’ in this study. In addition, the predicted ﬁ-sheets
with lengths less than two did not meet the annotation criteria.

2.3 Identifying aromatic residues with adjacent polar
residues

A previous study indicated that aromatic ligand-binding residues with
adjacent polar residues may form a cleft to bind a carbohydrate ligand
(Tormo at (11., 1996). Polar residues usually exhibit higher hydrophilicity
when exposed on the outer protein surface, and we have observed that the
reported aromatic ligand-binding residues of CBMs always reside in motifs
containing polar residues. Hence, this stage identiﬁed the aromatic residues
with adjacent polar residues within two amino acids in neighboring, and such
an aromatic residue was deﬁned as a hydrophilic aromatic residue. These
hydrophilic aromatic residues W, F and Y were denoted by the new terms
Wh , Fh and Yh, respectively. Then, the original 20 amino acids were extended
to 23 amino acids for the following procedures in this study. These two
conserved features in CBMs representing characteristic core ligand-binding
regions are expected to be aligned in sequence alignment.

2.4 Performing FIA against template sequences

In this stage, the system executed pairwise alignments of the target sequence
against relevant template sequences to accumulate conserved information
for the last evaluation stage. The standard dynamic programming approach
for global alignment (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) with an afﬁne gap
penalty (Gotoh, 1982) was applied. Needleman’s algorithm guarantees the
generation of an optimal solution and the afﬁne gap penalty is a better
gap model reﬂecting real evolutionary mechanisms without increasing time
complexity. Moreover, the goodness and ﬁtness of the scoring function
affects the alignment accuracy. Therefore, in this study, the scoring function
was redesigned and focused on hydrophilic aromatic amino acids and
secondary structure conservation as described in the previous sections. The
pairwise version of FIA deﬁnition is declared as follows. Suppose that two

sequences of the target sequence and the annotated sequence over 23 amino
acids including the three newly deﬁned hydrophilic amino acids are denoted
by S, and S”, respectively, where |S,| and |S,,| stand for the lengths of S,
and S”, respectively. S,[i] indicates the i-th amino acid in S,. The goal of
FIA is to optimize the alignment with properly inserted gaps within S, and
S”. The afﬁne penalty model requires three two-dimensional arrays of M ,
I and D to compute and store temporary sub-solutions. M [i][ j], I [i][ j] and
D[i][ j] represent the optimal alignment arrangements for the ﬁrst 1' amino
acids of S, and the ﬁrst j amino acids of St, ending with substitution, insertion
and deletion, respectively. In other words, the dynamic approach recursively
computed sub-solutions to optimize M [|S, |][|S,,|] from Equation (1) for the
two complete query sequences.

Case 3: EBM(a,b)*2,

Case 4: EBM(a,b),

In the original afﬁne penalty model, each entry is calculated among the
maximum value of the three conditions from M , I and D, respectively,
where (1 represents the gap extension penalty. In our implementation, to
avoid the abnormal cases of insertion concatenating deletion and deletion
concatenating insertion, the calculations of the values in I and D ignore the
conditions from D and I , respectively. In terms of the scoring function, the
raw substitution value for two amino acids is obtained from the BLOSUM62
matrix, a substitution matrix containing over 20 amino acids for sequence
alignment (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). By introducing three additional
hydrophilic aromatic residues and the gap symbol, the original BLOSUM
62 matrix is extended to a 24 X 24 matrix named the Extended BLOSUM62
Matrix (EBM) as shown in Supplementary Table S1. When two hydrophilic
aromatic residues align to each other, the substitution value is doubled from
the ordinary aromatic residues. In addition, the substitution value for a residue
and a gap is deﬁned as the lowest substitution value, —4 in BLOSUM62.
Subsequently, weighted and penalized substitution values vary based on
different properties as described in Equation (2). The substitution value of
two residues in ﬁ-strands is also increased. In addition, an insertion or a
deletion in a ﬁ-strand is a serious mutation, so the substitution value for an
amino acid and a gap in a ﬁ-strand element is double penalized. Through
the above substitution value adjustments, even in a low sequence identity
situation, the most important features of hydrophilic aromatic residues and
ﬁ-strands are expected to be located better.

2.5 Evaluating aligned aromatic residues

After the target sequence is aligned pairwise to each annotated sequence,
the ﬁnal stage is to evaluate the alignment of the aromatic residues in
the target sequence with the reported ligand-binding residues in annotated
sequences. Based on homologous conservation, it is assumed that if an
aromatic amino acid in the target sequence is aligned to a reported ligand-
binding residue in an annotated sequence, this aromatic amino acid is likely

to serve as a ligand-binding residue. The aligned aromatic residues in the
target sequence with higher chances of aligning to reported ligand-binding
residues in different templates are considered as the most possible candidates
for ligand-binding residues. In implementation, the merging processes sum
up the probabilities of adjacent aligned aromatic residues within a sliding
window size of ﬁve into one representative aromatic residue. The ﬁnal
predicted ligand-binding residues are determined by the consistency from
aligned aromatic residues in the target sequence, and the consistent rate for a
putative ligand-binding residue is formulated in Equation (3) where RI) and RC
represent a putative ligand-binding residue and a conserved ligand-binding
residue, respectively. Then, three conﬁdence levels of consistency with
template sequences (highly conserved, relatively conserved and unidentiﬁed)
are deﬁned. The highly conserved aromatic residues indicate the most
promising ligand-binding residues possessing at least 50% consistency. The
relatively conserved aromatic residues represent the median conﬁdence level
of putative aromatic residues with <50% consistency. The unidentiﬁed
aromatic residues signify a lack of consistency between the aromatic residues
in the target sequence and templates.

2.6 Materials

Employing CATH (Orengo at 611., 1997), a hierarchical protein structure
classiﬁcation tool, the proteins in CBM families classiﬁed into 2.60.40.10
(immunoglobulin topology) with structural information were employed
as the templates. Among the template protein set, those structures with
high sequence identity >30% were ﬁltered out and only ﬁve CBM
structures including the starch-binding domains derived from Rhizopus
oryzae glucoamylase (R0l2v8mA00) (Tung at 611., 2008), Aspergillus niger
glucoamylase (AnllacOAOO) (Sorimachi at 611., 1997), Thermoactinomyces
vulgaris ot-amylase-I (Tvl 1uh3A01) (Abe at 611., 2004), Thermoactinomyces
vulgaris ot-arnylase-II ( Tv|1bva01) (Karnitori at 611., 1999) and
Sulfolobus solfataricus ot-arnylase (Sslleh9A03) (Feese at 611., 2000)
remained as templates (2V8m is not classiﬁed in CATH yet, but it appears to
share similar structural topology as well as functional residues in 2. 60.40. 10).
The remaining template structures are considered to possess representative
and non-redundant characteristics and their corresponding ligand-binding
residues were previously identiﬁed (Chou 21111., 2009; Liu at 611., 2007; Tung
at 611., 2008) as shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The CBM domains
of the template structures and the target proteins were assigned by CATH
and GenBank (Benson at 611., 2009), respectively. The secondary structures
were predicted by DSC. For CBM45 and CBM53 family members, not
a single 3D structure has yet been resolved, hence two case studies of
domain sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana water dikinase (AtCBM45)
and starch synthase (AtCBM53) were applied to demonstrate the prediction
model and to construct hypothetical structures. In addition, the performance
of FIA-based prediction for both cases was compared with that of FRpred
which combine information from the conservation at each site, its amino
acid distribution, as well as its predicted secondary structure and relative
solvent accessibility (Fischer at 611., 2008). The AtCBM45 catalyzes the
transfer of the ﬁ-phosphate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to either C-
3 or C-6 of the glucosyl residue for starch phosphorylation (Mikkelsen
at 611., 2006). The AtCBM 53 contains a three repeated starch-binding
domains at the N-terminal portion of starch synthase III (SSIII) involved
in plant starch synthesis and plays a regulatory role in the synthesis of
transient starch (Valdez at 611., 2008). In terms of broad alignment accuracy
comparison, 808 sequences lacking of 3D structures were collected from 11
CBM families including CBM4, CBM6, CBM9, CBM20, CBM21, CBM25,
CBM26, CBM34, CBM41, CBM48, CBM53, among which 38, 63, 36, 131,
66. 15. 5. 59. 65, 317 and 13 domain sequences, respectively, were thoroughly
studied. Each sequence was randomly chosen as the representative for a
species without redundancy. Note that CBM45 was omitted because of
incomplete CBM domain assignment. In addition, the performance of FIA
on these query sequences was compared with six leading alignment tools,

ProbCons V1.12 and MAFFT V6.710b, using the default parameter settings.
Finally, the Friedman rank test (Milton, 1937) was applied to verify the
statistically signiﬁcant differences of alignment accuracy between each pair
of all alignment tools by SPSS V15. The resolved and hypothetical protein
structures were rendered by WebLab ViewerPro V4.

3 RESULTS
3.1 FIA illustration

In general, the dynamic programming approach for sequence
alignment optimizes sequential combination of insertion, deletion
and substitution. The scoring function affects how this combination
can be generated. Many algorithms aim to anchor similar short
regions in alignment (Chou et (11., 2006; Edgar, 2004; Katoh et (11.,
2002; Subramanian et (11., 2008). The goal of this novel approach
is to ﬂexibly anchor the key conserved regions according to their
physiochemical properties. When two sequences share low sequence
identity, such positions become more difﬁcult to align. To increase
the likelihood for alignment of conserved features, the substitution
values of the conserved properties in CBMs are speciﬁcally weighted
in FIA. As shown in Figure 2, the square and the bold arrows

were extra weighted. In other words, if a path is through these two
hydrophilic aromatic residues, a higher substitution value is earned.
On the other hand, the scoring for an insertion in a ﬂ-strand shown in
dotted arrow in Figure 2 paid an extra penalty whereas two residues
in two ﬂ-strands gained extra scores [refer to Equation (2)].

3.2 Prediction and veriﬁcation of ligand-binding
residues in CBM45 and CBM53

The ultimate goal of this study is not only to devise an accurate
alignment program but also to predict conserved ligand-binding
residues for protein sequences in CBMs based on conﬁrmed
ligand-binding residues. Then, FIA-based ligand-binding prediction
was derived from conserved aromatic residues in hydrophilic
regions. From the CBM45 and CBM53 family members, two
target sequences of AICBM45 and AICBM53 were aligned
pairwise against ﬁve template sequences to predict their conserved
ligand- binding residues. Figure 3 demonstrates two FIA pairwise
alignments between AICBM45 and Anl 1acOA00, as well as between
AICBM53 and R0|2v8mA00. The FIA calculation led to sequence
identities of 22.2 and 29.2% for these two cases. As expected,
the key aromatic residues and ﬂ-stranded elements were well
aligned in columns. Trp139 and Trp194 in AICBM45 and Trp340,
Trp366, Phe383 and Tyr394 in AICBM53 were predicted as ligand-
binding residues according to the consistent performance of the ﬁve
pairwise alignments. (The comprehensive analysis can be found in
Supplementary Figure S2.) To conﬁrm signiﬁcance at the structural
level, the two alignments were applied to generate hypothetical
structures. Figure 4 illustrates the two modeled structures from
Swiss-Model by incorporating the two FIA alignments in Figure 3.
Note that Swiss-Model originally failed to simulate using its
ﬁrst automated mode. The reported ligand-binding residues in
the template structures are highlighted in color sticks and the
predicted ligand-binding aromatic residues are highlighted in the
corresponding color sticks in the two hypothetical structures.
Interestingly, Trp139 and Trp194 in AICBM45 (Mikkelsen et (11.,
2006) and Trp366 and Tyr394 in AICBM53 (Wayllace et (11., 2010)
have been experimentally conﬁrmed as true ligand-binding residues.
Even the ﬁinctional role of Trp340 and Phe383 in AICBM53 have
not been reported, these two aromatic residues are evidently located
on the outer surface in an orientation similar to Tyr94 and Tyr83

hydrophilic aromatic residues are very likely to be potential ligand-
binding residues to be further investigated. In addition, direct
comparison of the performance between our FIA-based method
and FRpred was carried out and summarized in Supplementary
Table S3. FRpred is a machine learning methodology that combines
information from the conservation at each site, its amino acid
distribution, as well as its predicted secondary structure and relative
solvent accessibility. Nine CBMs with experimentally conﬁrmed
ligand-binding residues were collected as test dataset. While both
FIA-based method and FRpred can identify true ligand-binding
residues, our FIA-based method achieved a signiﬁcantly higher

needed for hands on site-directed mutagenesis.

3.3 Alignment accuracy comparison

In the aspect of computational performance, we also compared the
alignment accuracy for sequence similarity and identity among FIA
and six leading alignment programs. Table 1 summarizes the average
sequence similarities and sequence identities produced from FIA,
DIALIGN-TX, MUSCLE, T-COFFEE, ClustalW2, ProbCons and
MAFFT. A total of 808 sequences without structural information
were classiﬁed into 11 families, and each sequence was aligned
to the ﬁve template structures in a pairwise manner. That is,
the performance of all seven tools was calculated from 4040
(808*5) pairwise alignments. FIA achieved the highest average
sequence similarity (45.1%) and average sequence identity (27.2%),
whereas DIALIGN-TX gave the lowest average sequence similarity
of 29.9% and ClustalW2 showed the lowest average sequence
identity of 16.6%. Hence FIA improved the sequence similarity and
identity estimation in these CBM families. The superior alignment
accuracy indicates that the incorporated conservative properties are
informative under the condition of low sequence identity in CBMs.
Following the statistical analysis in MUSCLE and ProbCons, the
statistically different signiﬁcance was determined by P-values of
the Friedman rank test in terms of sequence identity and sequence
similarity as listed in Supplementary Table S4. Referring to the
performance comparison listed in Table 1, it is clear that FIA
obviously and signiﬁcantly outperformed the other six well-known
tools with P-values less than 1.0E—10 in all CBM families tested.
Besides, the performance of FIA on benchmark protein sequences
was also tested using BAliBASE in comparison with the same
six alignment tools in terms of sum-of-pair score. Supplementary
Table S4 indicated an average of 5.28% variation between FIA and
the other methods. Due to the advantage of incorporating speciﬁc
features for comparison of query sequences with low sequence
identity, FIA outperformed ClustalW2, T-COFFEE and DIALIGN-
TX in analyzing group ref3 data in BAliBASE with sequences
sharing <25% identity, as expected.

Prediction and verification of ligand-binding residue

 

3.4 Application of FIA on non-CBM proteins

FIA has been demonstrated in successful identiﬁcation of
hydrophilic aromatic residues and correlation of key ﬁinctional
residues in CBMs with main ﬂ-stranded structures. A more
challenging task is to investigate whether it is applicable to proteins
with different structural architectures. Here two non-CBM protein
families were collected for demonstrating the generalization of
this idea. As illustrated in Supplementary Figure S3, FIA analysis
of HSP20-like chaperones superfarnily possessing ﬂ-sheet-rich
domains leads to identiﬁcation of Trp48 in 1GME:A as a conserved
hydrophilic aromatic residue. This Trp48 has been proven as a true
ligand-binding residue (van Montfort et (11., 2001). In addition, for
E2 regulatory transactivation domain comprising of ai-helix and
ﬂ-sheet domains, FIA also successﬁilly identiﬁes the experimentally
conﬁrmed ligand-binding residues of Tyr19 and Tyr178 (Abbate
et (11., 2006). Hence in silico FIA prediction result is practically
applicable in correlation with in vitro ﬁinctional characterization of
a variety of proteins.

4 DISCUSSION

The original motivation of this study was to locate conserved
regions possessing hydrophilic aromatic residues and ﬂ-stranded
structures in CBMs. Based on accurate alignment results from FIA,
we further applied the idea to predict ligand-binding residues for
CBM45 and CBM53 family proteins lacking resolved structures.
Figure 3 demonstrates the strength of FIA and in that ﬂ-stranded
structures and aromatic residues appeared to be well aligned.
Low sequence identity makes it difﬁcult to recognize the core
regions in most cases, which implies that not every region in the
query sequence is equally important for molecular recognition.
Alternatively, if the key conserved regions can be well aligned or
anchored, the alignment quality will not drop substantially. Indeed
FIA successﬁilly predicts four experimentally conﬁrmed ligand-
binding residues in AICBM45 and AtCBM53. In addition, sequence
alignment is a preliminary analysis tool and is the foundation of
advanced research topics such as classiﬁcation (CATH), secondary
structure prediction (DSC) and structure modeling (Swiss-Model).
As shown in Figure 4, Swiss-Model alone originally failed to
simulate both of the AICBM45 and AICBM53 cases based on
its automated procedures. Combination of FIA and Swiss-Model
indeed led to successful generation of hypothetical structures, which
in turn might facilitate further investigation of the functional roles
of Trp340 and Phe389 in AtCBM53. Moreover, FIA achieved PPV
of 56.3%, while FRpred gave only 35.3%, from experimentally
conﬁrmed ligand-binding residues as indicated in Supplementary
Table S3. The higher PPV derived from FIA is beneﬁcial for
biologists by substantial reduction of experimental efforts and
expense in terms of ﬁnding crucial functional residues. Moreover,
Table 1 lists the performance comparison of FIA and the other
six outstanding alignment tools. FIA achieved the highest average
sequence similarity and identity among all tested families. FIA
signiﬁcantly improved sequence similarity and sequence identity at
a high conﬁdence level by Friedman rank test. These improvements
suggest that the incorporated biological features are informative for
increasing alignment accuracy. Besides, an excellent alignment tool
should insert fewer gaps to minimize alignment length. As shown
in Table 1, with the exception of FIA, MAFFT outperforms the
other ﬁve tools, by which ﬁve more averaged gaps were inserted

as compared with FIA (refer to Supplementary Table S2). These
ﬁndings suggest that FIA reports high alignment accuracy with
minimized alignment length. A similar knowledge-incorporated
approach was applied in constrained multiple sequence alignment
(Tang et (11., 2003). The problem was that the constrained positions
rely on experts’ prior knowledge. In contrast, FIA is based on
biological properties inside sequence content contained within
CBMs. Nevertheless, the hydrophilic aromatic residues in other
protein families including HSP20-like chaperones superfarnily and
E2 regulatory transactivation domain can be also identiﬁed and
correlated with ﬁinctional roles. Thus, FIA is easy to be generalized
without specialist intervention. Furthermore, advanced tools usually
rely on plain alignment, and the alignment quality directly affects
the performance of future studies. The advanced tools require
accurate alignment to increase their robustness. This requirement
emphasizes the importance of alignment accuracy. In practice,
FIA is based on the experimentally conﬁrmed ligand-binding
residues. More annotated sequences trend to increase the PPV.
Furthermore, the template structures were preclassiﬁed by CATH.
A more plentiﬁil and accurate structure classiﬁcation is believed to
extend protein categories that FIA can predict. For implementation,
FIA requires secondary structure prediction. When more accurate
secondary structure prediction tool is available, the performance
can be further improved.

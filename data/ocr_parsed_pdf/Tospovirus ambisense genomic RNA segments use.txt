ABSTRACT

Summary: The intergenic regions of the ambisense RNA segments of
viruses from the Tospovims genus form large extended RNA struc-
tures that regulate virus replication. Using comparative structure ana-
lysis, we show the presence of conserved alternative conformations at
the apical parts of these structures. In one conformation, a branched
Y-shape, the 5’-proximal hairpin arms are mostly capped by excep-
tionally stable tetraloop motifs. The tetraloop hairpins are folded in
both virus and virus-complementary sense RNAs, and different tetra-
loops can functionally replace each other. Folding simulations show
that the branched Y-shape structures can undergo a conformational
transition to alternative extended rod-like conformations. Functional
importance of both alternatives is supported by nucleotide covari-
ations. The balanced equilibrium between alternative structures is evi-
denced by native gel electrophoresis of mutant RNA transcripts with
shifted equilibria. The tetraloops play a role in the stability and dy-
namics of structures but may also be recognized by proteins involved
in translation and/or replication.

1 INTRODUCTION

Viruses of the genus Tospovirus are plant-infecting pathogens
that possess ambisense genomic RNA segments (Nguyen and
Haenni, 2003). These ambisense segments, M (medium) and S
(small), yield Viral RNA transcripts of opposite polarities with
non-overlapping protein-coding regions. The 3/ ends of VRNA
sense (the polarity of the negative-sense RNA packaged in the
Virion) and chNA (Virus-complementary) transcripts overlap in
the intergenic regions (IGR) (Fig. 1A).

The tospovirus M and S RNA transcripts are not polyadeny-
lated like the majority of eukaryotic mRNAs. Instead, they con-
tain A-rich sequences in the 3’UTR of mRNAs, encoded in the
IGRs that contain long stretches of A-rich and U-rich sequences.
This results in the folding of extended stem-loop structures that
have been suggested to regulate the translation and/or transcrip-
tion termination of mRNAs of both polarities (de Haan et al.,
1990; Geerts-Dimitriadou et al., 2012; van Knippenberg et al.,
2005).

The determinants of the regulatory functions of tospovirus
IGR structured domains are not yet known. The structures (fre-
quently called hairpins in the tospovirus literature) may fold into
various shapes with branched or unbranched apical parts at the
top of the A-Uirich stem-loops (e. g. de Haan et al., 1990; Geerts—
Dimitriadou et al., 2012; Knierim et al., 2006; van Knippenberg
et al., 2005). Here, we investigate the hairpins formed by the
tospovirus M and S RNA IGR domains, searching for conserved
structural features.

2 METHODS

The sequences of tospovirus RNA segments were retrieved from the
GenBank database using the Taxonomy Browser (NCBI Resource
Coordinators, 2013). The complete list of viruses studied and abbrevi-
ations is given in the Supplementary Data. The structures in the IGR
regions were predicted using free energy minimization algorithms of the
Mfold server (Zuker, 2003) and RNAalifold program (Bernhart et al.,
2008). On the localization of the structure, formed by the pairing between
A- and U-rich regions in a particular IGR region, the alternative apical
structures were explored by inspection of the suboptimal structures
yielded by Mfold program for the whole structural domain. To ensure
the exhaustive analysis of homologous structures in all known (partial)
sequences of the M and S segments, the sequences of various isolates of
the same virus were also searched by BLAST program using sequences of
previously found domains as queries. The kinetic folding pathways were
studied by simulations of cotranscriptional folding using the genetic al-
gorithm of STAR package (Gultyaev et al., 1995) and kinefold server
(Xayaphoummine et al., 2005). Native gel electrophoresis detection of
alternative conformations is described in Supplementary Data.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Conserved Y-shape tetraloop-containing structure and
an alternative stem-100p folding in tospovirus M RNA

The A- and U-rich regions in the tospovirus M segment IGRs
form extended stem-loop structures in both VRNA and chNA
sense (Geerts—Dimitriadou et al., 2012; van Knippenberg et al.,
2005). Our comparative RNA structure analysis, combining
thermodynamic and kinetic folding calculations with sequence
alignments of all available sequences, shows the presence of char-
acteristic RNA motifs in the apical regions of large A-Uirich
stem-loop domains (Supplementary Fig. S1). For instance, a
Y-shaped motif with two hairpins can be folded at the top of
the TSWV VRNA stem-loop structure (Fig. 1B and C). The two
hairpins, denoted here as L-arm and R-arm, contain loops of
four nucleotides. The L—arm loop sequence, GAAA, belongs to

the GNRA type of extra stable tetraloops (Heus and Pardi, 1991;
Woese et al., 1990) (here N is an arbitrary nucleotide, and R is a
purine). Remarkably, the 5’-proximal arm in the predicted
chNA structure, which is the mirror image of the VRNA R-
arm (Fig. 1D), also contains a tetraloop, UUCG, of another
extra stable UNCG type (Cheong et al., 1990; Tuerk et al.,
1988; Woese et al., 1990).

The Y-shaped conﬁguration is conserved in M segments of
other tospoviruses, except BeNMV and SVNaV that have an
extra hairpin inserted between two tetraloop hairpins, converting
the Y-shape into a trident conﬁguration (Supplementary Fig.
S2). All apical hairpins are supported by covariations and
base-pair indels (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore, the
5/-proximal hairpin loops in both VRNA and chNA structures
exhibit a preference for one of the stable tetraloop types
(Table 1). The VRNA L-arm is always a tetraloop, and diverse
VRNA and chNA loop sequences satisfy one of the known
tetraloop motifs: GNRA (Heus and Pardi, 1991; Woese et al.,
1990), UNCG (Cheong et al., 1990; Tuerk et al., 1988; Woese

et al., 1990) or YNMG (Proctor et al., 2002), where Y is C or U,
and M is C or A. The tospovirus tetraloop motifs can function-
ally substitute each other: the 5/-proximal tetraloops are GNRA
and UNCG types in VRNA and chNA, respectively, or the
reverse combination: GNRA in chNA and UNCG 0r
YNMG in VRNA (Table 1).

Insertion of an extra adenine in the GAAAA loop of GTV
(Table 1) is known to preserve the GNRA geometry in the
GNRNA or GNR(X)nA motifs (Legault et al., 1998; Lemieux
and Major, 2006). A cUUAg loop, predicted in the INSV
chNA, is one of the most stable triloops (Shu and
Bevilacqua, 1999). However, the TNRV and IYSV uAAAa
loops do not belong to the known exceptionally stable or fre-
quent triloops (Gardner et al., 2011; Shu and Bevilacqua, 1999;
Thulasi et al., 2010).

Structure predictions and multiple alignments (Supplementary
Fig. S1) show that all Viruses of the Eurasian and the BeNMV/
SVNaV clades (Chen et al., 2013; de Oliveira et al., 2012) can
also form an alternative extended rod-like structure competing
with branched structures with two or three hairpins. Apparently,
both alternatives and/ or equilibrium between them are functional
because they are stable thermodynamically, with rather close free
energy values, and are supported by covariations
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The RNA folding pathway simulations
(see Section 2) demonstrate that the tospovirus M RNA
branched structures and extended stem-loops can form sequen-
tially in the cotranscriptional folding pathway (Supplementary
Fig. S4). In these simulations, the L-arm VRNA hairpin (or
R-arm complement in chNA folding) is always formed ﬁrst.
On RNA elongation, the simulations suggest either the addition
of the second arm followed by the disruption of both hairpin
arms in favor of the more stable extended stem-loop or direct
initiation of the stem-loop without the second arm formation.
Some simulations predicted the Y-shape or trident conform-
ations to be the final fold. However, calculations of free energies
of alternative structures using Mfold server (Zuker, 2003) show
that such a simulation result is determined by deviations in used
thermodynamic parameters rather than by kinetic trapping in the
metastable structure. Nevertheless, the native gel electrophoresis
experiments with wild-type M segment fragments show that such
trapping is possible in vitro because the alternative structures can
be detected (Supplementary Fig. S5). Moreover, introduction of
mutations stabilizing one of the alternatives leads to the expected
equilibrium shifts.

3.2 Tetraloop hairpins and alternative structure in
tospovirus S RNA

Both tetraloop-containing structures and rod-like alternatives
were also predicted to fold in S segment VRNAs and chNAs
(Supplementary Fig. S6). The S segment structural motifs seem
to be less constrained than those of M segment. The two con-
served hairpin arms are mostly separated by spacers of various
lengths that may form their own structure. In four Viruses
(MeSMV, INSV, MYSV and PSMV), it was not possible to
identify an R-arm homolog, and the unusually short (183
nucleotides) IGR of the PolRSV S segment does not form an
A-Uirich structure at all because of the absence of the VRNA
U-rich stretch (Ciuffo et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the majority of

Note: The loop—closing pairs are shown in lowercase. The nucleotides in the loops other than stable tetraloops are shown by dots in the tetraloop type column.

S segment VRNAs and about half of chNAs have a tetraloop in
the 5’-proximal arm of IGR structure (Supplementary Table S2).
A tetraloop of the UMAC type, which resembles GNRA fold in
conformation and stability (Zhao et al., 2012), not seen in M
segments, is folded in the MeSMV S segment.

The rod-like structure is not conserved in S segments of
American clade Viruses. In spite of that, nucleotide covariations
in Eurasian clade structures suggest the importance of both
Y-shape and its alternative (Supplementary Fig. S6). Base-pair
indels and covariations occur simultaneously in both arms, pre-
serving not only the double-hairpin structure but also the alter-
native stem-loop conformation (Fig. 2).

4 DISCUSSION

Comparison of predicted tospovirus IGR structures shows that
their conserved hairpin arms exhibit a striking bias in the loop
sequences to form tetraloops in the 5/-proximal arms of both
VRNA and chNA structures, using a considerable part of the
known repertoire of extra stable tetraloop motifs. A probability
of such a bias to be determined by chance alone is negligible.
Given a structure with two tetranucleotide hairpin loops, what is
a constrained motif by itself, two stable tetraloops such as
GNRA and YNMG would randomly occur with probability
1/512 in an uniform nucleotide distribution (for GNRA/
UNCG: 1/ 1024). Conservation of these motifs in different Viruses
is not determined just by shared ancestry because various tetra-
loop types are found in homologous hairpins, showing that the
tetraloops were evolved several times. A probability of such in-
dependent events in different Viruses and segments to be deter-
mined by chance, being the product of sequence motif
probabilities, is negligible. This shows that the observed bias is
determined by strong evolutionary constraints.

Fig. 2. Coupled covariations (boxed) in the S segment VRNA structures

These constraints suggest fast cotranscriptional formation of
the metastable branched conﬁgurations that may delay the fold-
ing of more stable extended alternative stem-loops. The energy
barrier for this transition is determined by simultaneous disrup-
tion of two hairpins, with total stacking free energy of ~1}
20 kcal/mol in 8710bp capped by stable tetraloops. Thus, the
transition times may be considerable and effectively trap tospo-
Virus IGRs in branched conﬁgurations. Such kinetic trapping in
a metastable conformation is supported by the IGR folding
simulations and the experimental study of alternative structures
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The coupled covariation pattern invol-
ving more than two bases (Fig. 2) is an indicator of a ﬁne-tuned
conformational transition (Gultyaev et al., 2000), and multiple

Stable tetraloops in tospovirus ambisense RNAs

 

examples of functionally important cotranscriptional RNA fold-
ing are known (Lai et al., 2013).

Functional interchangeability of tetraloop types is usually ex-
plained by their exceptional stabilities (Sahu et al., 2012; Selinger
et al., 1993; Uhlenbeck, 1990; Woese et al., 1990). However, the
majority of tospovirus M segment GAAA tetraloops are closed
by a U-A base pair (Table 1), which neither confers the excep-
tional stability nor is a frequent GAAA closing pair (Woese
et al., 1990). Furthermore, the GAAA tetraloops fold signiﬁ-
cantly slower than YNMG ones and have folding kinetics com-
parable with the loops with an arbitrary sequence (Menger et al.,
2000; Nagel et al., 2006; Proctor et al., 2004). Thus, it seems that
certain features other than just thermodynamic stability and
folding rate are important in the tospovirus RNA tetraloop
replacements.

Both GNRA and YNMG tetraloops are able to form tertiary
interactions with various receptors in RNA (e.g. Proctor et al.,
2002; Wu et al., 2012) and also can be recognized by proteins
(Du et al., 2004; Legault et al., 1998; Melchers et al., 2006). For
instance, the less stable uGAAAa motif, present in many tospo-
Virus M segments (Table 1), speciﬁcally binds the phage A N
peptide (Legault et al., 1998). Furthermore, by analogy to the
behavior of the phage A N peptide targets, the GTV chNA
5/-proximal loop GAAAA (Table 1), containing the extruding
adenine from the GAAA-like fold, is expected to retain compar-
able binding properties.

The tospovirus IGR structures were suggested to stimulate
translation by assisting in circularization of mRNA (Geerts-
Dimitriadou et al., 2012). Their Y-shape conformation resembles
those of some of the plant Virus translational enhancers such as
the so—called BYDV-like cap-independent 3’UTR translational
enhancers (Meulewaeter et al., 2004; Shen and Miller, 2004).
Remarkably, the BYDV-like cap-independent 3/UTR transla-
tional enhancer left arms have GNRNA and GNRA loops
that have been suggested to determine the binding of the trans-
lation factor eIF4G and recruitment of eIF4E or other yet un-
identified proteins (Kraft et al., 2013; Shen and Miller, 2004;
Wang et al., 2010). The tospovirus S RNA structures have
been shown to act in concert with the Viral proteins N and
NSs, presumably involving NSs binding to RNA (Geerts-
Dimitriadou et al., 2012). One could speculate that the tetraloop
motifs in the tospovirus IGR structures determine the binding of
translation factors and/or other proteins.

A transition between two RNA structures may determine
switching between different processes such as translation, tran-
scription and replication. Replication enhancers may also adopt
various Y-shape or unbranched conformations with diverse loop
motifs (An et al., 2010; Baumstark and Ahlquist, 2001;
Olsthoorn and B01, 2002).

Structurally diverse IGR domains are also folded in the ambi-
sense segments of some Viruses of the genera Phlebovirus and
Arenavirus (Emery and Bishop, 1987; Lopez and Franze-
Fernandez, 2007; Simons and Pettersson, 1991), but these struc-
tures are not conserved. This may be explained by differences in
transcription termination mechanisms (Geerts-Dimitriadou
et al., 2012). Further research is needed to elucidate the roles
of the tospovirus ambisense IGR structures and the function
of the diverse tetraloop motifs.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to study
the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences
within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a
tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated
FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining
the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image
analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a
threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation.
As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from
experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell,
threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for
automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation
and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems,
we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to
automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing
the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound
Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is
utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction.
This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and
objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally,
FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between
differentially stained FISH probes.

Availability: FISH Finder is a standalone MATLAB application and
platform independent software. The program is freely available from:

1 INTRODUCTION

Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) is a technique used to
visualize the location of speciﬁc DNA sequences within the nucleus.
FISH incorporates ﬂuorescently labeled probes that bind only to
the segment of the genome with which they have a high degree of
sequence similarity. Thus, FISH provides a way to visually locate a
gene within the nucleus using ﬂuorescence microscopy. The process
of manual data acquisition is time consuming and subjective due to
inconsistency of an investigator’s decisions. Therefore, to achieve
high throughput and objectivity, the method of data acquisition

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

should be standardized as well as automated so less manual work is
required from the investigator and data are objectively acquired.

One simple automated approach to extracting a cell from the
background is achieved by setting a threshold value above the
background level of ﬂuorescent light intensity (Andrey et (11., 2010;
Shopov et (11., 2000): all pixels with light intensity values higher
than the threshold are considered as part of the valid nucleus, while
pixels with light intensity lower than the threshold are excluded
as background noise. Another similar approach is to set a ﬁxed
signal-to-noise ratio, which incorporates a ﬁxed threshold in order
to isolate and extract the valid nuclear boundary (Heintzmann
et (11., 2004; Pernthaler et (11., 2003). When cells contain relatively
homogenous 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) ﬂuorescence
signal intensities and have sufﬁcient contrast relative to the
background, these ﬁxed threshold-based methods often produce
biologically meaningful results. However, ﬂuorescent light intensity
values vary greatly between experiments and cell nuclei because
artifactual ﬂuorescence and cytological debris are usually present
in FISH experiments as well as the fact that cells have inherent
biological variations in shape, size and other properties. Due
to non-uniform intensities found within cells as well as in the
background of FISH images, ﬁxed threshold-based segmentation
methods have inherent limitations. As a result, common threshold-
based methods used by existing software programs often require
manual modiﬁcation from one sample to the next within the same
experiment (Iannuccelli et (11., 2010). Moreover, other advanced
segmentation methods such as dynamic programming (DP) or
pattern recognition require user interaction and/or training data for
producing optimum output (Gudla et (11., 2008; McCullough et (11.,
2008; Nandy et (11., 2009).

To overcome these limitations, we have developed a highly
automated graphical user interface software tool called FISH Finder,
which is speciﬁcally designed to analyze FISH images effectively
and objectively. The main contributions of FISH Finder are:
(i) it segments ﬂuorescently stained nuclei automatically using a
statistical approach called compound Bayesian classiﬁer to achieve
contextual classiﬁcation and segmentation; using this method, FISH
Finder produced highly satisfactory results of radial positioning
analysis in the study of subnuclear organization for seven genes
(Yokochi et (11., 2009). (ii) FISH Finder automatically identiﬁes up
to two FISH signals per ﬂuorescent channel and will compute the
shortest distance from ﬂuorescent signals to the nuclear boundary
or to other ﬂuorescent signals using the Euclidean metric. FISH
Finder allows for selection of up to 10 different ﬂuorescent signal
channels to be processed. (iii) Processed images can be opened
for editing or re-editing (i.e. add or remove FISH signals, remove

unwanted nuclear boundaries and add or adjust nuclear boundaries).
(iv) Finally, it allows investigators to save the results in comma-
separated values (CVS) ﬁle format that can be imported into other
computational software such as R or Microsoft Excel.

2 PROGRAM FEATURES

2.1 User interface

FISH Finder is platform independent and only requires a license
of MATLAB 7.1 or higher in addition to FISH Finder’s
MATLAB code (which is freely available for download at
http://code.google.com/p/ﬁshﬁnder/downloads/list). FISH Finder’s
graphical interface was created using the MathWorks MATLAB
programming environment. FISH Finder was designed for
investigators who have little or no experience using MATLAB
and have no background knowledge in computer programming
languages. Furthermore, the functionality of FISH Finder’s
graphical interface is divided into two main phases. The ﬁrst phase
is the automatic processing mode, which requires the investigator
to specify input data for processing. Once ﬁles are speciﬁed, the
program produces the necessary outputs or results for the second
phase, FISH Finder’s editor window, which allows the investigators
to verify, modify and export results.

2.2 Input

The FISH Finder input window allows users to specify images
to be processed. To achieve the ability of reading in different
types of input ﬁles such as Tagged Image File Format (.tiff) image
stack or DeltaVision (.dv) images stack, LOCI Bio-Format toolkit
is integrated into FISH Finder (http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-
formats). Furthermore, FISH Finder allows investigators to import
a list of data folders containing multiple FISH images for
processing. Investigators must specify the number of ﬂuorescent
channels to be analyzed and the order in which the DAPI channel
was ﬁltered during image acquisition before starting the image
analysis process. However, the investigator does not need to
specify or set any predeﬁned values for nuclei segmentation. FISH
Finder automatically determines optimal parameters for segmenting
foreground from background.

2.3 Segmentation via contextual classiﬁcation

The core component of FISH Finder is the automated nucleus
segmentation algorithm, which requires no adjustment of
segmentation parameters by an investigator. Instead of relying on a
threshold-based segmentation algorithm, the problem is posed as a
two-class classiﬁcation problem. First, FISH Finder selects the most
in-focus image using the DAPI staining channel from the image
stack; this is usually the image with the highest overall intensity.
Next, FISH Finder estimates the conditional probability distributions
for the background and the foreground (i.e. the nuclei) pixel
value distributions (i.e. the histogram of the DAPI-stained image),
similar to threshold-based methods. However, classiﬁcation based
on the initial estimated probability distributions by thresholding
is not sufﬁcient to handle signiﬁcant variations within cells and
between experiments. To be robust and reliable, we use a compound
Bayesian classiﬁer to enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy (Duda
et (11., 2000). The key difference between a threshold-based
method and component Bayesian classiﬁer is that the result from

the former depends only the pixel value itself, while the result
from the latter depends not only the pixel value itself, but also
the values in a predeﬁned neighborhood of surrounding pixels.
In other words, the compound Bayesian classiﬁer incorporates
contextual information of pixels to be classiﬁed. Especially
when variations within nuclei and in background are large, the
contextual information is a key factor for more robust and
accurate results. Additionally, FISH Finder iteratively re-estimates
the class-conditional probability distributions based on the current
classiﬁcation to improve the classiﬁcation—and therefore boundary
accuracy—until the improvement is not signiﬁcant. Importantly, this
entire process is shape independent.

After segmentation through classiﬁcation, FISH Finder extracts
the nuclear boundaries. These boundaries are then analyzed
automatically to detect incomplete nuclei. For example, if any
nuclear boundary contains 20% (as set by default) or more pixels on
the image boundary, then FISH Finder will consider that nucleus
to be incomplete and it will not be analyzed. In cases where
multiple nuclei merge together these can be manually segmented
(discussed below) or can be ignored. To alleviate false segmentation
of ﬂuorescent nuclear debris occasionally seen in FISH images, the
minimum cell size parameter can be optimized in FISH Finder’s
input window (note: the default setting of this adjustable parameter
was determined during design and development of FISH Finder).
For best results of segmentation with FISH Finder, we recommend
that investigators analyze images of stained nuclei at a concentration
in which cells are not overly clumped together.

2.4 Fluorescent probe signal extraction and positioning
analysis

A ﬂuorescent probe signal can be determined objectively by analysis
of pixel intensity values within an extracted nucleus. FISH Finder
computes the average light intensity of the ﬂuorescent probe signal
channel, which then serves as the threshold for selecting ﬂuorescent
probe signals. Any notable bright spots identiﬁed with higher
intensity than the threshold will serve as candidates for FISH signals.
Then FISH Finder reduces the number of candidate signals by
analyzing the size of the signal as well as comparing the intensities
of candidate signals. To accommodate variation in ﬂuorescent probe
signal strength and quality, the minimum intensity for FISH signal
detection can be optimized with adjustment of the threshold in FISH
Finder’s input window (note: the default setting of this adjustable
parameter was determined during design and development of FISH
Finder).

Given the location of a FISH signal, FISH Finder determines the
distance between the signal and the nearest point on the estimated
nuclear boundary using the Euclidean distance measurement. FISH
Finder then computes the radial distribution ratio, which is the
peripheral distance of the FISH signal divided by the average
radius from the estimated nuclear boundary. The average radius of
a segmented nucleus is determined by ﬁnding the radius of a circle
with the same area as the segmented nucleus.

2.5 Result veriﬁcation and editing

After processing image datasets, investigators can immediately
choose to open FISH Finder’s editing screen, which allows
investigators to import folders of processed data (Fig. 2). The editing
screen enhances the investigator’s ability to edit the image data

by allowing them to add or remove nuclei, to adjust a nuclear
boundary and to add or remove FISH signals (Figs 1—3). FISH
Finder incorporates two methods for redrawing boundaries of
nuclei: polygon segmentation and ellipse segmentation. Polygon
segmentation allows an investigator to manually select points around
the nucleus to be segmented. The boundary points chosen by the
user are not automatically smoothed, therefore accurate boundary
segmentation is directly dependent upon the location and the number
of chosen points (generally, a greater number of exact boundary
points chosen results in more accurate segmentation). The ellipse
segmentation allows an investigator to redraw a nuclear boundary
by manipulating the size and shape of the boundary selection tool,
which is restricted to the shape of ellipse. Generally, segmentation
with the ellipse segmentation function is not as accurate to the actual
nuclear border as the polygon segmentation function. However,
the ellipse segmentation function is useful for quick segmentation
studies that are not dependent upon accurate boundary segmentation,
such as analysis of inter-probe distances. Finally, FISH Finder
exports results of analysis as CVS ﬁles, which can be imported into
many computer software programs (such as R and Microsoft Excel)
for further analysis.

3 RESULTS

To evaluate the performance of our adaptive threshold method
of segmentation in comparison with a ﬁxed threshold method,
we compared FISH Finder with Nemo (Iannuccelli et (11., 2010).
We tested both FISH Finder and Nemo using 64 FISH images
containing 84 nuclei from a FISH experiment in which nuclei
from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were stained with
DAPI and a single bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC)-derived
probe was hybridized to its complimentary DNA sequence within

nuclei. FISH images were acquired using Applied Precision’s Delta
Vision ﬂuorescent light microscope producing images in the (.dv)
format. FISH Finder and Nemo were both tested on a desktop
computer running Windows Vista operating system with an Intel
Core 2 Quad 2.5 GHz processor. The analysis of each program
was conducted using default input parameters and settings. This
comparison demonstrates Nemo’s inability to accurately segment
nuclear boundaries in all tested images in contrast to FISH Finder’s
high efﬁciency and accuracy of nuclei segmentation (Fig. 4).

To compare the performance of FISH Finder and Nemo, we
examined the unedited results of segmentation analysis from
each program for the following categories: nuclei Identiﬁcation,
i.e. percentages of nuclei that are precisely identiﬁed as valid nuclei
to be further analyzed; nuclei accurately segmented, i.e. percentages
of nuclei with boundaries accurately segmented and not over- or
underestimated; nuclei overestimated, i.e. percentage of nuclei with
segmented boundaries larger than actual boundaries determined by
eye; nuclei underestimated, i.e. percentage of nuclei with segmented
boundaries smaller than actual nuclear boundaries determined by
eye; nuclei ignored, i.e. percentage of nuclei that were not identiﬁed
as valid nuclei to be analyzed; and nuclei adjoined, i.e. percentage of
nuclei with adjoining segmented boundaries (Fig. 5). Using the same
test image set, we also compared the results of accurate FISH signal
identiﬁcation and rate of false-positive FISH signal identiﬁcation
(Fig. 6). FISH Finder outperformed Nemo in every category except

crosshairs.) (c) Results of the nuclei division function showing adjoined

nuclei overestimated and nuclei adjoined. Additionally, the time
required for analysis by FISH Finder was signiﬁcantly less than
that of Nemo, where processing with FISH Finder took ~30 min
compared with ~5 days with Nemo.

We next compared the edited results of FISH Finder’s analysis
to the results of manual analysis of radial positioning. Results from
testing Nemo with the image set did not produce enough valid data
points in order to fairly quantify and compare graphically. In order
to produce valid data to compare, Nemo would require optimization
of input parameters for each individual FISH image, in contrast to
FISH Finder which does not require user-deﬁned input parameters
for automatic segmentation analysis. Using Applied Precision’s
Softworx program, manual analysis was conducted by measuring
distance of each signal to the nuclear boundary as well as measuring
the average diameter as judged by eye. The peripheral distances are
then computed as a ratio of the average radius for each nucleus
to determine the radial distribution of a target locus being studied.
Figure 7 shows the cumulative distribution of radial ratios of FISH
Finder results and manual analysis revealing a close correspondence.
For our analysis, we were unable to fairly compare Nemo’s results of
image analysis due to the high percentage of inaccurately segmented
nuclei as well as the high rate of false signal identiﬁcation present
in the processed image results.

In addition to radial position analysis, FISH Finder will also
compute the shortest distance between FISH signals of alternate
ﬂuorescent staining (Fig. 8). To compare FISH Finder’s analysis of
inter-probe distances to manual measurements, we analyzed two

FISH Finder was developed using FISH images acquired from
experiments on ESCs from the species Mus musculus, which has an
unusual distribution of heterogeneously compacted DNA revealing
regions of dense and loose compacted DNA when stained with
DAPI. In fact, FISH Finder was used to objectively analyze FISH
experiments in a study of the effects of the histone methyltransferase
G9a on the subnuclear position of seven genes (Yokochi et (11.,

it was not possible to make a fair comparison of the performance of
these programs.

4 CONCLUSION

FISH Finder is an important analysis tool capable of automatically
extracting nuclear boundaries via compound Bayesian classiﬁer,
localizing FISH signals and saving data in the CVS format for future
reference, signiﬁcantly enhancing investigators’ ability to verify
data. Consequently, FISH Finder minimizes errors due to manual
FISH analysis by reducing the cognitive bias of an investigators’
judgmental process. More importantly, FISH Finder is a highly
efﬁcient user-friendly software tool capable of high-throughput
FISH image analysis.

The functionality of FISH Finder can be enhanced and extended
in several ways. For example, it can be generalized to segment cell
nuclei in three dimensions: one way is to segment the images in a
Z-stack one by one; the resulting segmentation can then be combined
into 3D models of nuclei by interpolating signed distance functions
to the segmented nuclear boundaries. With 3D models, the distance
from FISH probes to the nuclear boundary in the 3D space can
be computed, leading to biologically more accurate results. While
most biologists prefer using familiar tools for the analysis, common
analysis tools can be readily incorporated into FISH Finder itself.
Additionally, FISH Finder can be modiﬁed and adapted to analyze
other ﬂuorescent signal types such as chromosome territories or
identiﬁcation of doublets and singlets for replication timing analysis
or identiﬁcation of more than two FISH signals for evaluating
aneuploidy. We have included a ‘New Issues’ tab on the program
download web page where users can start a forum for problems or
suggestions.

While FISH Finder produces satisfactory results on all datasets
we have used, it is based on a discriminative model, even though
it is more robust and accurate than some other systems by
employing a contextual classiﬁer via compound Bayesian classiﬁer.
A fundamentally different approach is to adopt a generative model-
based approach (e.g. Tu and Zhu, 2002), that is, a model that can
explain the observed pixel patterns. One such a model would be a
parametric description of each nucleus and the number of nuclei in

an image; for example, for the image shown in Figure 9d, an ideal
result would consist of ﬁve nuclei with different shapes. Intrinsic
advantages of a generative model would allow 3D measurements
within a nucleus as well as modeling of interactions among nuclei,
leading to more accurate results even when multiple nuclei are very
close to each other. This is being investigated.

Abstract

Summary: When performing DNA sequencing to diagnose affected individuals with monogenic
forms of rare diseases, accurate attribution of causality t0 detected variants is imperative but im—
perfect. Even if a gene has variants already known to cause a disease, rare disruptive variants pre—
dicted to be causal are not always so, mainly due to imperfect ability to predict the pathogenicity of
variants. Existing population—scale sequence resources such as 1000 Genomes are useful to quan—
tify the ’background prevalence’ of an unaffected individual being falsely predicted to carry causal
variants. We developed GeneVetterto allow users to quantify the ’background prevalence’ of sub—
jects with predicted causal variants within specific genes under user—specified filtering parameters.
GeneVetter helps quantify uncertainty in monogenic diagnosis and design genetic studies with
support for power and sample size calculations for specific genes with specific filtering criteria.
GeneVetteralso allows users to analyze their own sequence data without sending genotype infor—
mation over the Internet. Overall, GeneVetter is an interactive web tool that facilitates quantifying

 

and accounting for the background prevalence of predicted pathogenic variants in a population.

1 Introduction

Inaccurate attribution of causality to rare genetic variants found in
sequencing studies of subjects with rare diseases can limit the bene-
fits of screening and potentially result in harm (MacArthur et al.
2014). For accurate classification of a variant’s pathogenicity,
investigators typically account for multiple characteristics, such as
its allele frequency, conservation score and predicted functional con-
sequences. However, even after careful filtering and application of
these parameters to a known set of causal genes, a proportion of
non-causal variants are still at risk for being misclassified as causal
due to imperfect filtering. For example, it is reported than >l% of
general population can he falsely determined to carry causal variants
for maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a monogenic

form of diabetes (Flannick et (11., 2013). Our work is motivated by a
study of nephrotic syndrome (NS), a rare disease with more than 20
genes implicated as monogenic causes (McCarthy et (11., 2013).
Diagnosis of a monogenic cause in an NS patient may be important
for personalizing treatment plans. Many studies have quantified the
fraction of monogenic cases through targeted sequencing followed
by pathogenicity filtering in case-only cohorts (Sadowski et (11.,
2014). However, applying imperfect variant-filtering procedures
will misdiagnose a fraction of truly non-monogenic cases as harhor-
ing putative causal variants. In addition, this will result in a
non-negligible rate of ‘hackground prevalence’ of monogenic NS
diagnosis in the unaffected population. Beyond NS, when making
genetic diagnosis of any rare diseases in clinical or research settings,

variants that implicate subjects, and all the variants passing the filter
criteria. GeneVetter also displays a point estimate and 95% confi—
dence interval for the odds ratio of monogenic classification in a
user’s cases versus the 1000G subjects.

3 Conclusion

Studying monogenic rare diseases while accounting for the back—
ground prevalence of putative causal variants provides useful quan—
titative information for making accurate monogenic diagnosis,
calibrating stringency of variant filtering and estimating the effect
size from aggregate set of rare variants. GeneVetter comprehensively
and efficiently achieves this in a highly interactive fashion. While its
default settings were chosen carefully, we acknowledge that there is
as of yet no optimal filtering strategy. Thus it is also highly custom—
izable, allowing construction of alternative filters. Users can also
analyze their sequenced cases with GeneVetter and compare with
1000G without transferring individual genotype information over
the network. We expect GeneVetter to aid clinicians and scientists
who may not have time or technical expertise to perform tedious

data management tasks, but seek to improve accuracy in implicating
variants as causal for their disease of interest.

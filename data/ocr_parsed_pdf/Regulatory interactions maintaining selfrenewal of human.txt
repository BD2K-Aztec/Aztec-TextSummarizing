ABSTRACT

Motivation: Maintenance of the self-renewal state in human embry-
onic stem cells (hESCs) is the foremost critical step for regenerative
therapy applications. The insulin-mediated Pl3K/AKT pathway is well
appreciated as being the central pathway supporting hESC self-
renewal; however, the regulatory interactions in the pathway that
maintain cell state are not yet known. Identification of these regulatory
pathway components will be critical for designing targeted interven-
tions to facilitate a completely defined platform for hESC propagation
and differentiation. Here, we have developed a systems analysis
approach to identify regulatory components that control Pl3K/AKT
pathway in self-renewing hESCs.

Results: A detailed mathematical model was adopted to explain the
complex regulatory interactions in the Pl3K/AKT pathway. We evalu-
ated globally sensitive processes of the pathway in a computationally
efficient manner by replacing the detailed model by a surrogate meta-
model. Our mathematical analysis, supported by experimental valid-
ation, reveals that negative regulators of the molecules |RS1 and PIP3
primarily govern the steady state of the pathway in hESCs. Among the
regulators, negative feedback via |RS1 reduces the sensitivity of vari-
ous reactions associated with direct trunk of the pathway and also
constraints the propagation of parameter uncertainty to the levels of
post receptor signaling molecules. Furthermore, our results suggest
that inhibition of negative feedback can significantly increase p-AKT
levels and thereby, better support hESC self-renewal. Our integrated
mathematical modeling and experimental workflow demonstrates
the significant advantage of computationally efficient meta-model
approaches to detect sensitive targets from signaling pathways.

pathway and the RS-HDMR implementation are available from the

1 INTRODUCTION

Long-term maintenance of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)
in the self-renewal state requires a ﬁne balance of many signaling

pathways, including PI3K, TGFﬂ, WNT and ERK (Singh et al.,
2012). Several earlier studies have reported that the PI3K/AKT
pathway plays a central role in balancing self-renewal and dif-
ferentiation but with limited mechanistic details (McLean et al.,
2007). The pioneering work by Singh et a]. first recognized the
presence of molecular switches controlled by the PI3K/AKT
pathway that promotes self-renewal in its active state and
strengthens the differentiation signals in its inactive state
(Singh et al., 2012).

Kinase p-AKT is a key effector of the PI3K/AKT pathway and
participates in critical functions like survival, metabolism, protein
synthesis, cell cycle etc. (Taniguchi et al., 2006). In addition, in
hESCs, p-AKT regulates the activity of pluripotency factors like
c—MYC and controls the levels of differentiation molecules like p-
SMAD2/3, p-ERK, p-GSK3ﬂ in the self-renewal state (Singh
et al., 2012). Therefore, maintaining high levels of p-AKT is ne-
cessary for long-term self-renewal of hESCs.

In spite of the recognized role of p-AKT, there is limited
understanding on the maintenance of p-AKT levels in hESCs
by the network of regulatory interactions. The PI3K/AKT path-
way includes several positive and negative feedback loops and
negative regulators like the molecules PTP, PTEN, SHIP that
together inﬂuence its state (Taniguchi et al., 2006). Analysis of
such regulatory interactions will be helpful in the design of tar-
geted molecules to support self-renewal. This, however, requires
a quantitative systems-level approach rather than a restricted
study of few interactions. Therefore, in the current work, we
have used an integrated experimental and computational ap-
proach to identify regulatory interactions maintaining p-AKT
levels during hESC self-renewal.

This being the first effort toward modeling the PI3K/AKT
pathway dynamics in hESCs, our workﬂow includes the follow-
ing critical steps: (i) determine a mathematical structure
adequately describing the hESC system, (ii) determine the par-
ameter range over which the model captures hESC behavior, (iii)
identify the relative importance of components of the pathway in
hESCs, and (iv) validate the model-predicted sensitive processes
in hESCs. These steps result in a validated mathematical repre-
sentation of the pathway for hESCs. However, any modeling
effort of a biological system is incomplete without understanding
how parameter variability affects its predictions. We treat this as
an important requirement because of the notorious cell-to-cell
variability in hESC systems. We, therefore, (V) analyze the
propagation of uncertainty in the pathway under various states

marked by donut (negative feedback) and star (PTEN and FTP) are
perturbed in experiments mentioned in Figure 7

of the identiﬁed sensitive regulators. This will, in turn, allow
identification of processes that promote a robust behavior
under experimental variability.

To accomplish these objectives, we started with a well-
established, ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of insu-
lin-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway developed for adipocytes by
Sedaghat et a]. (2002). The model is a compendium of accepted
knowledge of the pathway, and has been successfully tested in
many mammalian systems. We developed a systematic procedure
to adopt the Sedaghat model to a system of self-renewing hESCs.
We first performed extensive parameter sampling to identify the
mechanisms relevant for hESCs. We next evaluated the most sig-
niﬁcant contributors to the active levels of key molecules using
global sensitivity analysis (GSA). We adopted random sampling
high-dimensional model representation (RS-HDMR)—based
meta-modeling approach to overcome the large Monte Carlo
(MC) sampling requirements of the traditional GSA. The
model-predicted sensitive processes were successfully validated
by a series of perturbation experiments. Our workﬂow, thus, dem-
onstrates the application of computationally efficient techniques
for mechanism detection in uncertain systems like hESCs.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Mathematical model of PI3K/AKT signaling

The insulin-mediated activation of the PISK/AKT pathway can be
divided into two modules: Module 1: insulin receptor activation, intern-
alization and recycling, and Module 2: post-receptor signaling cascade
involving PISK/AKT (Fig. 1A and B). On stimulation with insulin, in-
sulin receptors are auto-phosphorylated and become available for further
signaling. These active receptors then undergo intracellular trafﬁcking as

shown in Module 1. The active receptors on the surface propagate the
signal to components of PISK/AKT pathway as shown in Module 2. This
includes phosphorylated IRSl (tyrosine), kinase PISK and phosphoino-
sitol lipids like PI(3,4,S)P3 (or PIP3 henceforth). The signal then propa-
gates to important kinases like AKT and PKC-{. Negative regulators that
catalyze de-phosphorylation reactions include the following: PTPlB or
FTP (de-phosphoryate active receptors and active IRSl), PTEN (de-
phosphorylates PIP3 to PI(4,S)P2) and SHIP (de-phosphorylates PIP3
to PI(3,4)P2). The pathway also activates negative feedback loops by
serine phosphorylation of IRS] via kinases like PKC; and a double
negative loop from AKT resulting in deactivation of PTP. In this article,
we relaxed model assumptions by Sedaghat et a]. for a more generalized
analysis. The details of the ODEs and relaxed assumptions are given in
Sections 1 and 2 of the Supplementary Information. The current version
of the model comprises 27 reactions, 20 output species and 31 rate par-
ameters. From the rate parameters, 21 were selected as free inputs for
GSA (Supplementary Table SI), and the remaining were functions of
these selected inputs. Other input parameters included the concentrations
of the molecules PTP, PTEN and SHIP. The output molecules of interest
were p-IR, p-IRSl (Y), p-IRSl (S) and p-AKT.

2.2 RS—HDMR meta-model for analyzing global
sensitivity of high dimensional models

Traditional sensitivity analysis techniques are local in nature, and these
evaluate the inﬂuence of each free parameter in isolation while the re-
maining parameters are kept constant at their nominal values. This being
the ﬁrst attempt to model hESCs, it was necessary to estimate global
sensitivity measures that are applicable in a wide region of the parameter
space and capture parameter interactions. The advantages of traditional
GSA based on MC methods are, however, challenged by the large
number of parameters and the large number of samples required for
accurate estimates of the sensitivity indices. To reduce computational
cost, we adopted a meta-modeling technique called RS-HDMR de-
veloped by Li and Rabitz (2012).

2.2.] Meta-model development RS-HDMR is a multivariate regres-
sion technique that replaces the ODE model by complex surrogate func-
tions (hence meta-model) that describe the inputwutput (IO) behavior.
RS-HDMR decomposes the selected output of the ODE, Y=f(X) (say,
p-AKT), into component functions represented by the following hierarch-
ical expansion in the k input parameters, x1, x2, x3, ..., xk as:

17:11?) =f0 1‘ Z fi(XI')+ Z fI'j(XI', Xj) ‘l‘  +f123...k(X1, X2, ---, Xk)

151's]: 15i<j5k

(1)

The component functions represent the inﬂuence of each type of input
combination on the output and are higher-order integrals evaluated as
expected values, E(o), at given input instances;

Mean : f0 = E(Y)
First order : fi(x,-) = E( YIXI') —f0 (2)
Second order :f,-j(x,-, xj)=E(Y|xI-, xj) —fI' —fj —f0 Cic-

First-order functions describe the contribution of a single parameter in-
dependently of the others, whereas higher-order functions describe the
joint contributions of the parameters. Most importantly, the method rests
on the fact that the expansion given in Equation (1) often converges
rapidly so that higher-order interactions (:3) are often negligible (Li
and Rabitz, 2012). In this article, we used second-order approximation,
as it explained most of the variance in the data (>80%). The component
functions are approximated as mixtures of orthogonal polynomials whose

vector are generated within a speciﬁed range of the nominal values using
a uniform distribution. The model output generated for each of the sam-
ples is subjected to RS-HDMR analysis as described in the main text and

orders and coefﬁcients are evaluated from the 10 data using MC inte-
gration and least squares regression (See Supplementary Information,
Sections 3, 4 and 5 for details).

2.2.2 Computationally eﬂicient GSA The orthogonality of the
RS-HDMR component functions allows the estimation of individual
variances contributed independently (ﬁrst order) and jointly (higher
order) by the input free parameters. If 02 is the total variance of the
model output, Y6), in [0, 1]", the decomposition of total variance after
assuming that contributions from higher orders (:3) are negligible is
given by the following equation:

The Sobol’ indices describing the strength of each combination of par-
ameter can then be estimated using the relations:

Details of the evaluation are given in the Supplementary Information,
Section 4. The workﬂow for the entire meta-model development and
GSA is represented in Figure 2.

2.3 Experimental methods

Self-renewing H1 hESCs were treated with insulin (100 nM) and the
dynamics of components of PI3K/AKT pathway measured for 120 min.
The sensitivity of the processes identiﬁed by GSA was validated in these
cells using three types of perturbations. The molecules p-PKCg‘, PTEN
and FTP were perturbed from their basal levels in self-renewal media, and
resulting effect on key molecules like p-AKT was measured. See
Supplementary Information, Section 8, for details of the experimental
protocol, reagents and normalization method.

original Sedaghat model (Sedaghat et al., 2002), several phos-
phorylation and de-phosphorylation rate constants of Module
2 were ﬁxed by equilibrium ratios. For extension to hESCs, we
decoupled these rates by varying them independently in a realis-
tic range. These rate constants includeik7/1Rp, k_7, k8, k_g, kgstim
and k_9. To determine their realistic ranges, we first measured the
dynamics of key molecules of the pathway under insulin stimu-
lation in H1 hESCs. Representative molecules from different
positions of the signaling pathway were selected for analysis:
early (p-IR, p-IGFlR), mid (p-IRSl W), p-AKT) and late
(p-IRSl (S)). Figure 3 presents the dynamics of the measured
phospho—proteins. p-AKT showed an overshoot behavior and
it settled at intermediate values of 3-folds by 120 min (Fig. 3A).
The levels of p-IR and p-IGFlR increased rapidly to 2- and
8-fold within 15 minutes and remained at these levels till the
end of stimulation (Fig. 3A and B). Among the IRSl molecules,
tyrosine phosphorylation (p-IRSl 00) showed rapid increase
with maximum levels reached by 15min and then a downregu—
lation to intermediate values, which remained constant upto
120min (Fig. 3B). Serine phosphorylation of IRSl (p-IRSl (S))
showed an initial dip followed by upregulation at 30min and
then stabilization to basal levels. A distinct negative correlation
was observed between p-IRSl (Y) and p-IRSl (S) dynamics.
To select parameter ranges, we ﬁrst explored the behavior of
the relaxed Sedaghat model over a broad parameter range (100-
fold around nominal values). The basal levels of PTP, SHIP and
PTEN and initial concentration of insulin were also included as
additional parameters, resulting in 25 free parameters. 105
random samples were drawn from a uniform distribution of 25
parameters, and the ODE model was integrated for each sample
till 120min. This being the first modeling effort of the pathway
for hESCs, the actual parameter distribution is not known a
priori. Hence, a uniform distribution was used here. The proﬁles
were normalized to the maximum level and clustered using
k-means algorithm on p-AKT dynamics. There were three
major clusters (Fig. 4A£ and Supplementary Table S2 and

and 3 showed the characteristic overshoot behavior, but only
cluster 3 showed intermediate steady state values as seen in the
experiments in Figure 3A. We also saw good correlation between
experimental and clustered proﬁles for other molecules, p-IR and
p-IRSl (Y) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cluster 3 being our primary
cluster of interest; we wanted to select parameter ranges deﬁning
this cluster. Hence, we first analyzed parameters primarily segre-
gating the three clusters. It was observed that of the 25 param-
eters, only six were varying between the three clusters: k7/1Rp,
k_7, k8, lag, kgstim and k_9. Among these, the activation parameters
were high and deactivation parameters were comparatively low
in cluster 3. The distribution for de-activation parameter, k_7 for
each cluster is shown in Figure 4D. The distributions for remain-
ing parameters are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. Based on
these distributions, we narrowed the range of the six parameters
around the peaks for cluster 3 (Fig. 4D and Supplementary
Fig. S2). The chosen restricted ranges of the parameters are pre-
sented in Supplementary Table S1. We next performed GSA in
the restricted parameter ranges to identify the key parameters
regulating the self-renewal state of hESCs.

3.2 Meta-model representation and efﬁcient GSA

To reduce the computational cost associated with GSA, we
adopted RS-HDMR (Li and Rabitz, 2012), to explore the
model IO behavior and also to rank the parameters using
Sobol’ sensitivity indices. The performance characteristics of
the method has been validated for diverse physical systems (Li
and Rabitz, 2012). Here, we have applied the technique for a
high-dimensional, non-linear signal transduction model.

To check the validity of RS-HDMR and its computational
efﬁciency, we compared the Sobol’ indices estimated using
RS—HDMR with direct MC evaluations for one of the output
molecule, p-IR.

First, we analyzed the effect of sample size on the sensitivity
index evaluated both by direct MC and by RS-HDMR. Direct
MC identiﬁed the basal rate of receptor recycling, k_4, as the
most sensitive parameter with a Sobol’ index (S,) of 0.38.
Figure 5A compares the convergence of Sobol’ indices for this
parameter by the two methods, for sample size (N) ranging from
102 to 105. We see that the two methods converge to the same
value by a sample size of 104. Relative ranking of parameters are
often more informative than the actual value of the sensitivity
index. Hence, Figure 5B represents the ranking of the parameters
obtained by direct MC analysis for 105 samples and compares it
with RS-HDMR predictions at different sample sizes. Overall, it
is observed that the parameters with higher sensitivity were pre-
dicted with great accuracy even at low sampling of 103. Beyond
the fourth-ranked parameter for 103 samples and eight-ranked
parameter for 104, there is considerable deviation from MC ana-
lysis. The higher sampling size of 105, however, closely predicts
the direct MC estimates for most of the parameters throughout
the range. Hence, a sample size of 105 was chosen for the remain-
ing work.

The primary motivation for adopting RS—HDMR is the com-
putational efﬁciency of the algorithm. The computational cost of
traditional GSA is primarily associated with the need for re-
peated sampling to evaluate the integrals. In contrast, using poly-
nomial approximations in RS-HDMR, both low- and high-order
Sobol’ indices can be estimated simultaneously from one set of
MC samples. As an example, we have tabulated the typical time
requirements for first-order indices in Figure 5C. Obtaining all
the first-order Sobol’ indices by RS-HDMR requires ~9 min,
although it takes 300 min for direct MC. In RS—HDMR, a crit-
ical source of error is the MC integration approximation for the
high dimensional integrals. The error of this approximation is
inversely proportional to the sample size as N”2 and favorably
independent of the dimension (Li and Rabitz, 2012).

3.3 Sensitive parameters for key molecules of the pathway

On conﬁrming the accuracy of second-order RS-HDMR for the
current model, we next determined the globally sensitive param-
eters for the steady state of four molecules of the pathway: p-IR,
p-IRSl (Y), p-IRSl (S) and p-AKT (Fig. 6A). The resulting
output distributions are presented in Supplementary Figure S4
and overall performance in Supplementary Table S3. We see that
the sensitivity contribution of each parameter to the different
outputs is different. In Module 1, rates of recycling of the non-
phosphorylated receptors, k_4 and active receptor internalization,
k4, were important. These parameters primarily changed the
steady state levels of the active receptors p-IR and also affected
p-IRSl W) and p-AKT levels to a small extent. The initial insu-
lin levels and the binding rate of insulin to the receptors, k1, were
the other parameters affecting p-IR, but they did not affect the
other molecules. The important parameters from Module 2 were
primarily associated with negative regulators of the pathway.
These included many of the deactivation rates: de-phosphoryl—
ation of p-IRSl W), k_7, deactivation of PI3K, lag, and

Fig. 6. Results from second-order RS-HDMR analysis (A) Scaled ﬁrst-order RS-HDMR based Sobol’ indices. The indices have been scaled by the
maximum value for each output to show the relative importance of the parameters. p-IR is only affected by internalization and recycling processes. For
the other molecules, negative regulators upstream of PIP3 and negative feedback by serine IRSl are the most sensitive. (B) Scaled second-order Sobol’

indices of p-AKT and the two groups with important interactions

de-phosphorylation of PIP3 to PI(4,5)P2, k_9. All these param-
eters were upstream of PIP3 and affected the p-AKT levels con-
siderably. p-IRSl (Y) was affected mostly by k_7 whereas p-IRSl
(S) was affected mostly by k_g and k_9. Another important set of
parameters was associated with negative feedback by p-PKC;
and subsequent serine phosphorylation of IRSl. These included
the Hill equation parameters, Vmax, Kd, n and the IRSl serine
phosphorylation rates, k7, and k_7,. These parameters signiﬁ-
cantly affect the p-IRSl (S) levels followed by p-IRSl W) and
p-AKT. Thus, it is seen that for the intracellular molecules, most
of the sensitive parameters are ‘negative regulators’ of molecules
upstream of PIP3 or they are associated with ‘negative feedback’.
Additionally, for p-AKT, there were also important contribu-
tions from the second-order indices.

For p-AKT, the second-order indices contributed to 28% of
the variance. Figure 6B presents the heat-map of the scaled se-
cond-order Sobol’ indices. The sensitive parameters were found
to cluster in two groups: Group A: interaction between negative
regulators upstream of PIP3 (~7%) and Group B: interaction
between negative feedback parameters with negative regulators
from Group A (~6%) (Supplementary Table S4). It is important
to note that these parameters also had important ﬁrst-order con-
tributions. Second-order interactions further increase the sensi-
tivity of these parameters (Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.4 Experimental validation of sensitive processes in
hESCs

As seen from the previous section, the model-predicted sensitive
perturbations on the system include (i) negative feedback Via
p-PKC; and (ii) negative regulators that affect the de-phosphor—
ylation of PIP3 (Summarized in Fig. 1). To validate the sensitivity
of these processes in hESCs, we performed targeted perturb-
ations (See Supplementary Information Section 8), and we care-
fully chose perturbations that would result in increase in p-AKT
levels to avoid differentiation. For negative feedback, the ideal
candidate for perturbation is p-PKC; and for de—phosphoryl-
ation rates upstream of PIP3, two such candidates exist,
namely PTEN and PTP.

3.4.] Inﬂuence of negative feedback on self-renewing
hESCs Self-renewing hESCs were subjected to 20min treat-
ment of 10 MM GO6983 (PKC-t inhibitor) based on Zheng
et al. (2000). In our experiments, we see large change in
p-AKT (6-fold) and moderate change in p-IRSl (Y) (1.5-fold)
levels for small decrease in p-PKC; level (Fig. 7A). Similar trends
were predicted by model simulations (Fig 7A, red lines). Thus,
small changes in the strength of negative feedback propagated to
large changes in the levels of p-AKT. While sensitivity indices
indicate the importance of a parameter on a speciﬁc output, the

Fig. 7. Comparison of experimental and model analysis of sensitive processes in self-renewing hESCs. (A) Effect of perturbation of (i) negative feedback
by GO-6983 at 1 uM, (ii) PTEN by pr(HOpic) at 100 nM and (iii) PTEN -l- PTP by pr(HOpic) at 1 uM. The top bar graph shows the quantitative
analysis of western blots (bottom panel) using LiCOR image analysis software. Note: Missing bars indicate that the proteins were not analyzed in that

experimental data, are shown by red lines overlaid onto the experimental bars of p-AKT and p-IRSl (Y). All parameters are at nominal values. (B) First-
order component functions showing the effect of parameter k_9 and k_7 on p-IRSl (Y) and p-AKT. Red curve is the ﬁrst-order component function and
blue scatter points are the ODE model Monte Carlo outputs used to construct RS-HDMR functions. The scatter points represent the inﬂuence of
variability in the other parameters (See Supplementary Fig. S4 for output density). (C) Second-order component functions showing interaction between

k_9 and k7s on p-IRSl (Y) and p-AKT

directionality of the effect, positive or negative, cannot be dir-
ectly deduced from Sobol’ indices. The meta-model representa-
tion of RS-HDMR is particularly suited for such deduction as
this information is contained in the hierarchical component f unc-
tions of the decomposition. Increasing the strength of negative
feedback (increasing k7,) decreases p-AKT and p-IRSl (Y)
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Therefore, we see a positive correlation
between p-AKT and p-IRSl (Y). The sensitivity based on ﬁrst-
order indices show smaller increase in p-AKT, but the experi-
ments clearly show a large increase in p-AKT levels. We envisage
this to be the effect of non-linear inﬂuence of the other sensitive
processes. For example, model simulations show that under com-
plete inhibition of negative feedback, the levels of p-AKT will
rise considerably if the inﬂuence of negative regulators like
PTEN are low to begin with (low k_9) or the levels of positive
regulators like PIP3 are high (Supplementary Fig. S7).

3.4.2 Influence of PIP3 de-phosphorylation 0n self-renewing
hESCs under basal PTP levels Using a direct inhibitor of
PTEN, pr(HOpic), we studied its effects on p-AKT and p-IRSl
W) (Schmid et al., 2004). At a low concentration of 100 nM for
24 h, the compound is known to suppress active PTEN, thereby
increasing inactive p-PTEN. Our experimental data shows that
small change in PTEN resulted in 2-fold increase in p-AKT (Fig.
7A). The levels of [FIRSI W) showed a 1.5-fold decrease. Similar
trends were predicted by model simulations (Fig 7A, red lines) and

by RS-HDMR (Fig. 7B). This effect is primarily because of the
strengthening of negative feedback leading to indirect inhibition
of p—IRSl OK). This also points to the fact that p-AKT is more
sensitive to PIP3 levels as compared with p—IRSl W).

3.4.3 Inﬂuence of PIP3 de-phosphorylation 0n self-renewing
hESCs under PTP inhibition Next, we validated the effect
of combined PTEN and PTP inhibition to check whether PTP
inhibition increases p—IRSl W) when PTEN is still inhibited. At
higher concentrations, the same complex prﬂ-IOpic) can inhibit
both PTEN and PTP. We treated hESCs with 1 pM inhibitor for
20min following Schmid et al. (2004). Our experimental results
show a proportional increase in all the three molecules, p—AKT,
p-IRSl W) and p-PTEN (Fig. 7A). Similar trends were predicted
by model simulations (Fig. 7A, red lines) and RS-HDMR
(Fig. 7B). The increase in p-IRSl (Y) is primarily because of
PTP inhibition (decrease in k_7), as PTEN inhibition alone resulted
in a decrease in p-IRSl W). Thus, under PTEN -l- PTP inhibition,
p-IRSl W) overcomes the effect of increase in downstream nega-
tive feedback. In our experimental studies, we observed that
the largest increase in p-AKT levels was brought about by the
inhibition of negative feedback. This was also predicted by the
second-order RS-HDMR component functions for p—AKT.
The second-order component functions for one such combination,
k_9 and k7, is presented as a heat-map in Figure 7C for p—AKT and
p-IRSl H). For low k_9 and low k7,, there was signiﬁcant positive

contribution to the p-AKT levels but not for p-IRSl (Y).
Combining this with the ﬁrst-order contribution from k_9 and
k7, in this regime and together with the mean, f0, we get the
total p-AKT of 47% [f0 + f (k_9) + f (k7,) + f (k_9, [(7’)]. Altema—
tively, this effect is reduced when the negative feedback is strength-
ened. For example, in the low k_9 and high k7, regime, the same
contribution to p—AKT amounts to 23%. Therefore, strong nega-
tive feedback can considerably decrease the sensitivity of other
reactions involving PTEN and PTP.

3.5 Robustness of system behavior under parameter
uncertainty

While mathematically representing hESC systems, it is important to
consider the effect of variability as observed in different experimen-
tal repeats. To test how parameter uncertainty inﬂuences the
variability in the model output, we chose a biologically realistic
log-normal distribution of the parameters centered around the
nominal values. From the negative feedback parameters, the
value of the most sensitive parameter, k7, was varied as follows:
(i) no negative feedback, k7, = 0, (ii) nominal level of feedback,
k7, = 0.347, and (iii) 10 times stronger feedback, k7, = 3.47.
Figure 8A presents the probability distribution of steady state
levels of p-AKT and p-IRSl (S), respectively, when exposed to
parametric uncertainty, under these different levels of negative feed-
back. The model shows that strengthening the feedback parameter
reduces variance in the distribution for each molecule. Hence, the
robustness of the system to input perturbations is enhanced in the
presence of a strong negative feedback. In addition, it was observed
that the distribution for p-AKT was narrower as compared with
p-IRSl (S). To verify this observation, we plotted steady state levels
of p-IR, p-IRSl (S) and p-AKT from ﬁve different experimental
repeats in Figure 8B. We see a comparatively high variability in
p-IR and p-IRSl (S) levels but interestingly, p-AKT shows a
narrow range of variability (see cell-to-cell distribution in
Supplementary Fig. S8). Negative feedback, thus, plays an import-
ant role in maintaining robust levels of the important molecules

under experimental variability. Additionally, Pearson pairwise cor-
relation between the molecules showed a good agreement between
the experiments and model predictions (Fig. 8C and D).

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Meta-model approximation for GSA of complex
biological signal transduction models

In this article, we, for the ﬁrst time, present a detailed analysis
of the regulatory interactions in PI3K/AKT pathway actively
maintaining the self-renewal state of hESCs. A key step in our
workﬂow is the analysis of the uncertainty associated with the
strength of interactions in the PI3K/AKT pathway of hESCs
using a meta-model-based GSA. GSA captures the complete
non-linear associations between the model parameters in a suf-
ficiently wide region of the parameter space and is suited for non-
linear systems. The traditional methods of GSA are variance
decomposition schemes involving exhaustive exploration of the
parameter space. This renders the use of a detailed parametric
analysis of large-scale ODEs expensive restricting the modeler
to fairly simple local analysis. To explore IO relationships efﬁ-
ciently, we adopted meta-model approach called RS-HDMR to
obtain accurate information on the sensitive model parameters.
RS-HDMR constructs a complex surrogate function to replace
the ODE model and evaluates MC integrals of the Sobol’ indices
efﬁciently. The method has been proven to perform well in a
variety of engineering systems where parameter uncertainty is a
norm. In the current work, the method was explored for a signal
transduction model in a 25 dimensional parameter space. We
demonstrated that the method is especially accurate in identify-
ing the most sensitive parameters and their functional relation-
ships to the output. Also, the technique, being independent of the
total number of parameters can be applied to larger models
common in systems biology. Hence, it is a promising alternative
to evaluate global sensitivities with computational efﬁciency,

Sensitivity analysis of PI3K/AKT pathway for hESCs

 

instead of settling for locally based approximations as commonly
done in signal transduction studies.

4.2 Implications of GSA of molecules belonging to
PI3K/AKT pathway

Through our systems level analysis, we found that parameters
associated with post receptor processes can affect the levels of
intracellular molecules of the PI3K/AKT pathway more than the
receptor level processes for high insulin concentrations. The high
sensitivity of the post receptor processes is in support with pre-
vious experimental and modeling analyses that show that the
functionality of insulin signaling can be severely affected by
mutations associated with post receptor signaling molecules
(Nyman et al., 2012). Additionally, on removal of equilibrium
relationship between the forward and backward reactions, it was
observed that the de-phosphorylation reactions of the direct cas-
cade were highly sensitive although the phosphorylation reac-
tions were comparatively insensitive as seen in other systems
like the MAPK/ERK pathway Noon and Deisboeck, 2009).
This is an important relation, as many of the de-phosphorylation
reactions are dependent on the concentrations or functionality of
phosphatases that can vary widely with the cell type and state
and are also implicated widely in diseased states Noon et al.,
2010). Our analysis also shows that because of the competing
nature of the reactions in this module of the pathway, there is a
considerable non-linear outcome to simultaneous changes in the
sensitive parameters, for example, reduction of sensitivity to
PTEN and PTP inhibition by strengthening negative feedback.
Such non-linear behavior was seen in an experimental study in
hESCs, where inhibition of a direct phosphatase to p-AKT ren-
dered the p-AKT levels insensitive to PI3K inhibition (Yoon
et al., 2010). Our current analysis thus highlights the importance
of non-linear interactions in determining the effect of perturb-
ations on the pathway components. This is an important out-
come of mechanistic modeling and will prove useful in the design
of targeted interventions for many systems.

4.3 Modeling self-renewal in hESCs

4.3.1 Processes aﬂecting pathway dynamics in hESCs Insulin
stimulation experiments in self-renewing hESCs showed an over-
shoot behavior in the dynamics of post receptor molecules. Two
possible candidates have been identiﬁed to explain such over-
shoot behavior in other cell types: (i) receptor internalization
and (ii) downstream negative feedback from still unknown regu-
lators of receptor de-phosphorylation (Nyman et al., 2012).
Usually, there is combined contribution from both the processes.
In our hESC system, however, we do not see substantial over-
shoot behavior in p-IR dynamics, but surely there is a clear de-
crease in downstream p-IRSl (Y) levels and an accompanying
increase in p-IRSl (S) levels. This indicates that the negative
feedback acting at the level of IRSl is responsible for decrease
in p-IRSl (Y). This was also seen from the negative correlation
between p-IRSl N) and p-IRSl (S). Our clustering analysis
showed that many of the de-phosphorylation reactions above
PIP3 had to be maintained at low levels, and it was necessary
to couple this with an existing negative feedback to see an over-
shoot behavior.

4.3.2 Processes aﬂecting p—AKT levels in self-renewing
hESCs The central molecule like p-AKT can counterbalance
the mechanisms that may lead to differentiation and support
mechanisms that can lead to self-renewal (Singh et al., 2012).
Any increase in p-AKT levels has been shown to result in
increased stability and self-renewal capacity of hESC cultures.
For example, the levels of the active form of self-renewal mol-
ecule c—MYC can increase with increase in p-AKT levels Noon
et al., 2010). Yet, there are limited efforts to understand how
regulatory mechanisms affect long-term maintenance of self-
renewal in hESCs, which was the focus of the current study.
Under the current culture conditions, the receptor level processes
were found to be less sensitive. Therefore, a promising strategy to
increase p-AKT levels is inhibition of internal signals that sup-
press p-AKT. Our results suggest that inhibition of negative feed-
back via PKC-g is one such mechanism. A parallel experimental
study has recently demonstrated the positive attribute of PKC
inhibition in hESC self-renewal, but did not offer any mechan-
istic insight (Gafni et al., 2013). Additionally, model analysis
shows that any perturbation in the phosphorylation and
de-phosphorylation reactions of this pathway (for example,
PTEN and PTP inhibition) would still need the removal of nega-
tive feedback mechanisms to increase sensitivity to these
interventions.

From uncertainty propagation analysis, we show that negative
feedback also increases the robustness of p-AKT levels to vari-
ations in the levels of upstream molecules. Mechanisms like nega-
tive feedback are known to impart robustness in many biological
systems. Interestingly, the steady state correlation between mol-
ecules of the pathway held under experimental variability. In
conclusion, the strength of negative feedback needs to be main-
tained in a ﬁne balance. Weakening the negative feedback is
favorable for self-renewal but is associated with increased
variability.

5 CONCLUSION

The current work has developed a mathematical structure of
the PI3K/AKT pathway, validated by experiments, to describe
self-renewing hESCs. Adoption of RS-HDMR, a powerful meta-
modeling technique, allowed feasible evaluation of GSA of the
complex non-linear pathway. An important conclusion from our
study is that the maintenance of p-AKT levels, and hence the
self-renewal state of hESCs, is controlled by many of the negative
processes of the pathway. Additionally, non-linear interactions
identiﬁed by RS-HDMR show that the existing negative feed-
back plays an important role of desensitizing the pathway to
input perturbations and thus, regulates the steady state distribu-
tion of molecules in self-renewing hESCs. Inhibition of negative
feedback can significantly increase p-AKT levels and support
self-renewal, but with a trade-off associated with increased vari-
ability. Such mechanistic analysis of new systems like hESCs is a
critical step toward identiﬁcation of new targets for optimizing
cell culture conditions.

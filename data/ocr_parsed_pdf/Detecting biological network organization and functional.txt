ABSTRACT

SUMMARY: We developed a package TripletSearch to compute
relationships within triplets of genes based on Roundup, an
orthologous gene database containing >1500 genomes. These
relationships, derived from the coevolution of genes, provide valuable
information in the detection of biological network organization from
the local to the system level, in the inference of protein functions and
in the identification of functional orthologs. To run the computation,
users need to provide the GI IDs of the genes of interest.

1 INTRODUCTION

A logic triplet of genes is a set of three genes with a logic relationship;
for example, gene c is present in a genome if and only gene a and
b are both present (Bowers et al., 2004). We developed a method
to effectively search for those triplets by incorporating phylogeny
balancing into the phylogenetic proﬁles of triplets. We found logic
triplets to be very powerful in the detection of biological network
organization and identiﬁcation of key genes and their protein
functions, including adjacent and distant proteins in a pathway, and
even interactions among different pathways at the system level (Cui
et al., 2011). Here, we provide the programs to search those logic
triplets based on a large phylogenetic proﬁle matrix containing 182
bacteria genomes and 87 441 orthologous gene clusters. The matrix
was generated through Roundup (DeLuca et al., 2006), one of the
largest gene orthologs databases on the intemet, containing 770
bacteria, 55 archaea and 76 eukaryotes.

Among possible logic relationships involving three genes, the
four types in Figure l are most likely to be present in real cellular
networks (Bowers et al., 2004; Cui et al., 2011). In addition, we
also developed methods to detect if instead of if and only if (iﬁ’)
relationships for the four types, because our study suggested the
former might be very common (Cui et al., 2011). Please see ‘List

organizations; black dots represent chemical compounds. Type 1: c is present
in a genome iff a and b are both present. Type 3: c is present in a genome
iff a is present or b is present. Type 5: c is present in a genome iff a is
present and b is absent; it means protein 1) may inhibit enzyme a or c. Type
7: c is present in a genome iff one of either a or b is present. Terminology:
iff means if and only if.

2 PROGRAM INTERFACE

The program package TripletSearch includes a ﬁle for the
phylogenetic proﬁle matrix of 182 representative bacteria genomes
and 87 441 genes and 7 python and C++ programs. A python script,
computeTriplets.py, provides a uniﬁed interface to users.

The script requires three inputs: the name of the phylogenetic
matrix ﬁle, the name of the ﬁle to store triplets and the GI IDs of
target genes.

The script also takes ﬁve optional inputs for users to ﬁne-tune
the number of triplets produced. (i) The minimum number of 0’s
or 1’s a gene proﬁle should contain. The default is 10% of the
number of genomes in the matrix ﬁle; smaller numbers cause a gene
proﬁle to have too little entropy to be informative. (ii) The minimum
number of 0 or 1 combinations in the joint distribution between the
proﬁles of two genes. The default is 5% of the number of genomes
in the matrix; smaller numbers not only lead to more triplets but
also a higher false positive rate. (iii) The minimum AU value, a
variable measuring the likelihood of triplets, ranging from 0 to l
with increasing likelihood; default is 0.3. Please see ‘Search for iﬁ’
logic relationships’ in Supplementary Material for details. (iv) The
at value measuring the likelihood of if triplets for one tailed Z test;
default is 0.99. And (v) the number of target genes a candidate triplet
should contain. For example, if the status of a single gene in the
whole cellular network is of interest, all the triplets containing that
gene might be valuable. However, if the interaction of two genes
is important, only triplets containing both genes may be wanted.

Finally, a user might only focus on triplets comprised entirely of
target genes.

3 APPUCANON

As our study suggested, logic triplets can be very helpful in the
detection of biological network organization at different levels (Cui
et al., 2011). For example, a predicted logic triplet, fabH is present iﬁ’
either fabF or fabB is present, matches exactly to the relationship of
the three genes in Escherichia coli. In fatty acid biosynthesis, if fabH
is responsible for the initiation of elongation, then the subsequent
rounds of elongation can be carried out by either fabF or fabB
(Keseler et al., 2009) (See Supplementary Figure S1 for details).

In addition, logic triplets reveals the function and network location
of putative genes. A triplet tch is present iﬁ’ both ybiW and pﬂD
are present indicates that enzymes coded by ybiW and pﬂD ﬁmction
closely with the one coded by tch. Indeed, although there is not
yet any experimental data on those two genes, other computational
studies have suggested such a link as well (Chen et al., 2011; Keseler
et al., 2009).

Interestingly, logic triplets are also suggestive of translation
regulation. A triplet lldD is present iﬁ’ one of either accA or ach
is present may seem odd at ﬁrst. In E. coli, lldD catalyzes the
production of pyruvate, which is then converted to actyl-CoA. accA
and ach are the two subunits of acetyl-CoA carboxyltransferase.
However, a recent study suggests that ach binds to the mRNAs
of accA and ach to inhibit the translation and that such binding is
mutually exclusive with the substrate binding for catalytic activity
(Meades et al., 2010). Therefore, the suggestion from the triplet that
those two subunits cannot coexist in some bacteria is possible.

Finally, logic triplets can identify ﬁmctional orthologs, the
gene pairs with similar function but no sequence similarity. For
example, an inﬂuential paper studied the formation of disulﬁde bond
in bacterial proteins (Dutton et al., 2008). While most bacteria

contain DsbA and DsbB which function sequentially to form the
bond, several major bacterial phyla do not have DsbB. The study
ﬁnally identiﬁed VKOR as the ﬁmctional ortholog of DsbB through
experiments. With our method, a strong triplet DsbA is present iﬁ’
either DsbB or VKOR is present would pinpoint the missed gene
quickly.

In summary, logic triplets are useﬁil in the detection of biological
network organization, the inference of protein ﬁmction and the
identiﬁcation of ﬁmctional orthologs. Our package TripletSearch
provides the phylogenetic proﬁle matrix of large number of genes
across a wide spectrum of bacteria genomes and a group of user-
friendly programs to search for those triplets. Users can also create
customized phylogenetic matrix from > 1500 genomes available at
our Roundup website (http://roundup.hms.harvard.edu/retrieve/).

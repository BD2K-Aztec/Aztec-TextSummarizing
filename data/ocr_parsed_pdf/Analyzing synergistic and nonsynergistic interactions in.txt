Abstract

Motivation: Understanding the structure and interplay of cellular signalling pathways is one of the
great challenges in molecular biology. Boolean Networks can infer signalling networks from obser—
vations of protein activation. In situations where it is difficult to assess protein activation directly,
Nested Effect Models are an alternative. They derive the network structure indirectly from down—
stream effects of pathway perturbations. To date, Nested Effect Models cannot resolve signalling
details like the formation of signalling complexes or the activation of proteins by multiple alterna—
tive input signals. Here we introduce Boolean Nested Effect Models (B—NEM). B—NEMs combine the
use of downstream effects with the higher resolution of signalling pathway structures in Boolean
Networks.

Results: We show that B—NEMs accurately reconstruct signal flows in simulated data. Using B—NEM
we then resolve BCR signalling via P|3K and TAK1 kinases in BL2 lymphoma cell lines.

Availability and implementation: R code is available at https://github.com/MartinFXP/B—NEM

1 Introduction

Cells process input signals to output signals using a network of cellular
signalling pathways. For example, a small molecule binds a membrane
receptor. The signal is brought into the cell via structural modification
of the receptor. A set of kinases and other signalling molecules propa-
gate the signal through the cytosol. This involves both activation and
repression of proteins. Often complexes of multiple proteins must
form before a signal propagates. Some of the molecules are also part of
different pathways linking multiple pathways together. Eventually, the
signal enters the nucleus where transcription factors and chromatin
remodelling enzymes become activated. Finally, the combination of
activated transcription factors and regulatory co-factors leads to the

transcription of a large set of genes changing the phenotype of the cell.
Understanding the structure and the interplay of pathways is crucial
both for understanding the cellular mechanism and for designing novel
therapies that target specific pathways.

Inferring networks from molecular profiles is a well-developed
field in bioinformatics. Transcriptional data can be generated more
easily compared with protein activation data. Consequently, many
algorithms were developed that focus on the reconstruction of regu-
latory networks. For example, Gaussian graphical models (Schafer
and Strimmer, 2005), Bayesian networks (Friedman et (11., 2000),
the PC-algorithm (Kalisch and Biihlmann, 2007) or the Algorithm
for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (Margolin

et al., 2006). All these methods use observational gene expression
data to construct regulatory networks based on different association
scores between genes.

It is no problem to quantify the expression of any gene using
standard methods like qPCR, microarrays or RNAseq. Observing
signalling networks is more complicated. Protein activation can op—
erate on the levels of protein expression, cellular protein localization
or protein modifications like phosphorylation, ubiquitination etc.
Although there are assays to assess activation on any of these levels,
those assays are more elaborate, more expensive and less generic.
Moreover, for every protein a priori information on which type of
modification mediates signal transduction is necessary.

Molecular biologists have been inferring pathways without for—
mal computations for many years. Typically functional/interven—
tional data are used. Pathways are perturbed by activation or
inhibition of genes and the consequences of the interventions are
observed, organized and interpreted. Also a range of algorithms
have been described that formalize these types of arguments and
make them accessible to bigger and more complex pathway models.

Sachs et al. (2005) use flow cytometry data from perturbation
experiments to infer protein signalling pathways with a Bayesian
network approach. They test for conditional independence between
proteins” states using protein inhibition experiments and direct
measurement of these states.

Markowetz et al. (2005) introduced Nested Effects Models
(NEMs) (Froehlich et al., 2011; Markowctz et al., 2007;
Niederberger et al., 2012). NEMs infer non—transcriptional signalling
pathways by transcriptional downstream effects of pathway perturb—
ation. A pathway is activated in a set of cellular assays where specific
pathway components are silenced. The silencing of a specific compo—
nent blocks the flow of information in a specific branch of the path—
way. As a consequence, genes that normally change expression in
response to the stimulus no longer react in inhibition assays. NEMs
infer the pathway structure from the nesting of these sets: if the ef—
fected genes of perturbing gene B are a noisy subset of the effected
genes of gene A, then A is upstream of B. This concept has been ex—
tended to time series data (Anchang et al., 2009; Dﬁmckc et al., 2014;
Froehlich et al., 2011), evolving networks (Wang et al., 2014), and
network inference with hidden confounders (Sadeh et al., 2013).

To date NEMs can infer the upstream/downstream relations of
genes in a pathway (Markowetz et al., 2005), they can distinguish
activation from repression (Vaske et al., 2009) and they can resolve
the flow of information (Anchang et al., 2009; Froehlich et al.,
2011). However they cannot model the role of complex formation
in signalling pathways. If a protein X is activated by a complex, all
members of the complex must be present and in the correct activa—
tion state. The proteins in the complex operate concertedly and are
linked to X by an AND gate. In another scenario, X can be activated
independently by several proteins. In this case the proteins are linked
by an OR gate. Boolean Networks (Kauffman, 1969) model logical
gates. They have been used to simulate signalling pathways (Klamt
et al., 2007) and to reconstruct them from interventional data (Saez-
Rodriguez et al., 2009). Allowing for logical gates lead to identifi—
ability problems of network structures. To resolve these ambiguities,
prior knowledge on the pathway structures is used. Saez-Rodriguez
et al., (2009) describe an algorithm called CellNetOptimizer to con—
struct signalling pathways from directly observed activation states
of proteins in the Boolean Network framework. They combine prior
knowledge networks (PKNs), with protein phosphorylation data
from interventional assays.

Here we describe Boolean Nested Effect Models (B—NEM). This
method combines advantages from Boolean Network Models and

Nested Effect Models. Like Boolean Networks B—NEMs distinguish
between the alternative and cooperative activation of a protein, and
like normal NEMs, B—NEMs do not need direct observations of pro—
tein activity. Moreover, B—NEMs can use data from assays where
several pathway genes are perturbed simultaneously. In the follow—
ing, we will describe the model formalism and define a pathway
score together with a genetic algorithm to search for high scoring
networks. We will then validate our algorithm on simulated data
and use it to analyze B—cell receptor (BCR) signalling in lymphoma
cells.

2 Boolean NEMs

2.1 Pathway model and score

2.1.1 Signalling pathways and deterministic boolean networks
Molecular signalling pathways can be described as Deterministic
Boolean Networks (Sacz—Rodrigucz et al., 2009). Networks are
encoded as directed acyclic hyper—graphs ‘P : (S. H) consisting of
a set of nodes S : (S1. . . . .SN) and a set of Hyper—edges H :
(H 1, . . . HM). Every node S, represents a signalling protein that can be
either active (Si: 1) or inactive (Si: 0). Hyper—edges describe how the
signal is propagated through the network. Every directed hyper—edge
H, connects one or more parent nodes with a single child node. Hyper—
edges with one parent node specify whether the child is activated or re—
pressed by its parent. Hyper—edges with more parents specify a unique
activation pattern of the parent nodes that is required for activating the
child. If a node has multiple incoming hyper—edges, it can be independ—
ently activated by all of them. Hence, every hyper—edge with more than
one parent node encodes an AND gate and multiple hyper—edges with
the same child form OR gates (Fig. 1). Signalling pathways form AND
gates, if multiple proteins need to be jointly activated to propagate the
signal to their target molecule. This is often associated with the forma—
tion of larger protein complexes. OR gates in contrast occur when sig—
nalling is organized in a redundant manner. As with Bayesian networks
and NEMs, we assume that the real graph is acyclic. This limits the
scope of the method to models of signalling pathways in which the sig—
nal is propagated from receptors via branching cytosolic effector path—
ways into the nucleus without feedback loops.

2.1.2 Experimental design and data

Our goal is to estimate the signalling pathway model ‘P from a
dataset D. The data consist of K gene expression profiles (D(1), . . . ,
D(K)) from a set of functional assays with specific perturbations of
the pathway. We assume that the expression data are on a logarithmic
scale. Perturbations include the exogenous stimulation of pathway re—
ceptors and the inhibition of signalling components. Every profile
D(k) is hence associated with a specific experimental condition C(k)
that specifies which receptors were stimulated and which signalling
genes were inhibited. This is the typical experimental set—up of NEMs
(Markowetz et al., 2005, 2007). Following the NEM literature, we
call the signalling pathway components S1.  Sn S—Genes and the
genes that show expression changes in response to perturbations E—
Genes. S—genes and E—genes can but need not overlap.

2.1.3 Expected and observed response schemes

For a given hyper—graph ‘P and a given condition C(k), we can calcu—
late the activation states of all nodes in ‘P as follows: (i) root nodes
are initialized to zero, (ii) stimulated nodes are set to 1 and inhibited
nodes are set to 0 independently of any incoming signals from parent
nodes, (iii) all other nodes are determined by propagating activation
states through the directed acyclic graph using the Boolean functions

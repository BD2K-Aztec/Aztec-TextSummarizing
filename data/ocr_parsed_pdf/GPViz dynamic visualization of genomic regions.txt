ABSTRACT

Summary: GPViz is a versatile Java-based software for dynamic
gene-centered visualization of genomic regions and/or variants.
User-defined data can be loaded in common formats as resulting
from analysis workflows used in sequencing applications and studied
in the context of the gene, the corresponding transcript isoforms, pro-
teins and their domains or other protein features. Both the genomic
regions and variants can be also defined interactively. Various gene
filter options are provided to enable an intersection of variants, gen-
omic regions and affected protein features. Finally, by using GPViz, we
identified differentially expressed exons, which could indicate alterna-
tive splicing events, and found somatic variants in different cancer
types affecting metabolic proteins. GPViz is freely available at http://
icbi.at/gpviz (released under GNU general public license), is based on
Java 7 and can be used as a stand-alone or Web Start application.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently emerging high-throughput sequencing technologies
enable the detection of mutations and genomic variants (Single
Nucleotide Variants) from exome or whole genome sequencing
data and the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed exons or
transcripts from RNAseq data. Several tools are available for
mapping features to the genome, including subsequent Visualiza-
tion [e.g. Integrative Genomics Viewer (Thorvaldsdottir et al.,
2012)]. To functionally interpret the data, it is necessary to ana-
lyze and Visualize variants or other genomic features also in the
context of proteins and protein domains. Algorithms like Sorting
Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) or PolyPhen-2 and other func-
tional impact metrics allow prediction of the effect of variants
(i.e. nsSNPs) and amino acid substitution on protein functions
[see recent review (Pabinger et al., 2013)]. MuSiC (Dees et al.,
2012) can be applied to perform a proximity analysis of muta-
tions. Another application allows domain mapping of disease
mutations (Peterson et al., 2010), and within the Ensembl protein
summary View (Flicek et al., 2013) reported mutations can be
Visualized in the context of protein domains. Alternative splicing

and exons can be analyzed and Visualized using AltAnalyze and
domain graph (Emig et al., 2010). The web application that
covers a number of intended issues to Visualize genes, transcripts
and protein domains or other features is FancyGene (Rambaldj
and Ciccarelli, 2009). Finally, there are a number of further
possibilities for Visualization of multidimensional genomic and
sequencing data (Schroeder et al., 2013).

To the best of our knowledge, an interactive tool for Visual-
ization of differentially expressed exons (or deﬁned genomic re-
gions) and nucleotide variants in the context of gene structure,
transcript variants and encoded proteins is still missing. To close
this gap, we developed GPViz, a versatile Java-based software,
which enables this Visualization based on the gene and transcript
structure (genomic coordinates of exons), gene, protein and
domain annotations.

2 FEATURES
2.1 Input and output data formats

GPViz supports common data formats, as used within and
resulting from standard sequencing workﬂows and genome
browsers. The following four types of information can be option-
ally loaded:

(1) Gene structures can be loaded as General Transfer Format
files. These data are essential for usability.

(2) Genomic regions can be added in Browser Extensible Data
(BED) format (tab-delimited text ﬁle, including informa-
tion about chromosome, start and end position within
chromosome and strand).

(3) Nucleotide variants and mutations can be loaded in stan-
dardized formats (mutation annotation format, mutation
format, variant call format and SNP file format).

(4) Protein domains and features can be loaded in formats as
retrieved from protein domain databases (i.e. Conserved
Domain Database or Pfam) or as customized tab-
delimited text file including domain information (protein
ID, type, from, to, ID and name).

Additionally, to map additional gene and protein information
(e. g. UniProt ID) annotation ﬁles are loaded automatically in the
background. This feature can be conﬁgured in the option dialog.

Publication-ready images can be saved in different sizes and
resolutions either individually (genewise), as a batch of several
different files (in many common ﬁle formats including scalable

ment (Portable Document Format or Tagged Image File
Format).

2.2 Display and ﬁlter options
GPViz provides various display options including:

o Interactively adding and removing regions and/or variants
that are displayed as individual tracks (different types of
mutations are shown with different symbols),

0 Showing and hiding of individual samples (variants or
regions), transcripts or protein domain sets,

0 Highlighting of regions and variants in a union transcript
and union protein and

0 Changing color schemes for all features, zooming View and
varying introniexon space ratio.

The advanced filter options enable ﬁltering of genes that show
variants, regions mapping to the gene, mapping to protein do-
mains or mapping and intersecting defined regions and variants.

3 RESULTS

All data can be customized by the user because GPViz is de-
veloped as a Visualization tool to be used for any application
and organism. We additionally provide test datasets considering
the latest genome assembly of human and mouse and annotation
from Refseq and Ensembl. To demonstrate how GPViz can
be used, two case studies were analyzed step-by-step (see
Supplementary Material). Brieﬂy, RNAseq analyses using appli-
cations like DEXSeq (Anders et al., 2012) or exon array analyses
result in a list of differentially expressed exons. GPViz analysis
enabled the selection of candidate exons to distinguish between
transcript isoforms (indicating alternative splicing events) as well

as ﬁltering and Visualization of exons affecting protein domains.
In the second case study, we could show that somatic mutations
in different cancer types might affect metabolic enzymes and,
therefore, alter cancer metabolism. A representative example of
a somatic mutation in the gene isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
(IDHl) (amino acid position 132) occurring in acute myeloid
leukemia (TCGA, 2013) is shown in Figure 1. Using an add-
itional sample showed that this mutation occurs also in other
cancer types (i.e. rectal adenocarcinoma).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The nucleosome is the basic repeating unit of chromatin.
It contains two copies each of the four core histories H2A, H2B, H3
and H4 and about 147 bp of DNA. The residues of the histone proteins
are subject to numerous post-translational modifications, such as
methylation or acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitiation followed
by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique that provides genome-wide
occupancy data of these modified histone proteins, and it requires
appropriate computational methods.

Results: We present NucHunter, an algorithm that uses the data from
ChIP-seq experiments directed against many histone modifications to
infer positioned nucleosomes. NucHunter annotates each of these
nucleosomes with the intensities of the histone modifications. We
demonstrate that these annotations can be used to infer nucleosomal
states with distinct correlations to underlying genomic features
and chromatin-related processes, such as transcriptional start sites,
enhancers, elongation by RNA polymerase II and chromatin-mediated
repression. Thus, NucHunter is a versatile tool that can be used to
predict positioned nucleosomes from a panel of histone modification
ChIP-seq experiments and infer distinct histone modification patterns
associated to different chromatin states.

1 INTRODUCTION

The genome of eukaryotes is packaged into a macromolecular
structure called chromatin. The basic repeating unit of chromatin
is the nucleosome, which contains two copies each of the four
core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, around which a 147-bp
stretch of DNA is wrapped in a ﬂat left-handed superhelix
(Luger and Richmond, 1998). Nucleosomes form approximately
every 200 bp along the genome to package the underlying DNA.
Apart from the packaging function, nucleosomes may serve as a
signaling module (Turner, 2012) that is integrated into biological
processes acting with and on chromatin. This signaling function
depends on post-translational modiﬁcations of the histone
proteins, such as acetylation and methylation of lysine residues.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

These histone modiﬁcations may serve as a binding platform for
non-histone proteins, whose activities change chromatin struc-
ture and function.

When nucleosomes tend to form at the same or nearby gen-
omic positions in different cells, they are called (well) positioned.
Positioned nucleosomes are important for the hypothesis that
nucleosomes constitute a signaling module, because gross move-
ments of modified nucleosomes along the chromatin ﬁbers may
lead to a loss of coherence between the modifications and the
genomic features and/ or functions.

The binding locations of modified histone proteins can be
determined by a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by sequencing [ChIP—seq; Johnson et a]. (2007)]. The
immunoprecipitation step enriches for chromatin fragments con-
taining a histone modiﬁcation of interest, whereas the sequencing
step is used to quantify the abundance of the underlying DNA.

Because the core histone proteins are part of a stable proteini
DNA complex, it is natural to assume that the localization of
modiﬁed histone proteins corresponds to the position of the nu-
cleosomes. This suggests that histone modiﬁcation ChIP—seq
data can be used to infer nucleosome positions. However, this
is far from being a trivial task for a number of reasons: (i) histone
binding does not seem to be as sequence-speciﬁc as for many
transcription factors; (ii) nucleosome positions can change con-
siderably with time and across cells; and (iii) the data are affected
by sparse sampling and high noise.

Nucleosome calling algorithms, such as the one presented
here, aim at detecting positioned nucleosomes. To obtain a com-
prehensive and reliable set of predictions, one should combine
the information contained in as many ChIP—seq experiments as
possible and allow for some plasticity in the shape of the signal.
However, modiﬁed histones tend to be mixed-source factors
(Landt et al., 2012), which means that the degree of positioning
can vary considerably across the genome. In regions where nu-
cleosomes occupy different positions in different cells (e. g. within
the body of actively transcribed genes), nucleosome calling algo-
rithms are less suitable than segmentation approaches [Song and
Smith (2011); Zang et a]. (2009), to mention a few], which aim at
detecting domains of high nucleosome abundance.

A number of tools for the inference of nucleosome positions
have already been developed. Most of them apply signal process-
ing techniques, such as Fourier transforms (Flores and Orozco,
2011), wavelet decomposition (Zhang et al., 2008a) and ad hoc
ﬁlters (Albert et al., 2007; Weiner et al., 2010), to smooth the
enrichment profile, followed by the detection of local maxima.
Others are based on Bayesian modeling of the nucleosome

enrichment pattern (Zhang et al., 2012). These methods do not
allow one to control for systematic biases by comparing the nu-
cleosome calls with data from control experiments. Furthermore,
they cannot integrate data from multiple histone marks in a
straightforward manner. Finally, because of the large size of
the problem, e.g. the human genome, and the potentially high
number of histone modiﬁcations, the runtime and memory con-
sumption of these tools may limit their applicability.

Our tool can use information from a control sample to correct
for systematic biases inherent in this high-throughput technol-
ogy. It is designed to integrate multiple histone marks to broaden
the range of nucleosome positions that can be detected. It anno-
tates each identified nucleosome with the contributing histone
modiﬁcations. We will demonstrate that these annotations can
be used to cluster nucleosomes by their histone modiﬁcation
patterns. This clustering yields patterns of modiﬁcations that
can be correlated to the function of the chromatin, such as tran-
scriptional start sites and enhancers, or to the underlying process,
such as transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. These
results support the assumption that nucleosomes serve as signal
modules for biological process and that the corresponding his-
tone modiﬁcation patterns are a reﬂection of the signaling taking
place on these modules.

2 METHODS

The algorithm performs three major steps: (i) a preprocessing step, where
each ﬁle containing the chromosomal positions of mapped reads is turned
into a numerical signal, (ii) a shape detection step, where candidate pos-
itions for nucleosome formation sites are detected and (iii) a ﬁltering step,
where these candidates are ﬁltered and scored accounting for a number of
possible sources of bias. In the following, we will refer to the enrichment
proﬁle on the positive or negative strand as the signal that counts for each
location the number of positive or negative reads whose 5’ end maps
there, and they will be denoted P(p) and N(p), respectively, where p is
the chromosomal position.

2.1 Preprocessing

A well-positioned nucleosome typically exhibits the enrichment proﬁle
shown in Figure 1: a peak of positive strand reads upstream of the nucleo-
some location, and one of negative strand reads downstream. To obtain a
consensus signal, which will be called the input signal I, the enrichment
proﬁle on the positive strand P is shifted to the right, the one on the
negative strand N is shifted to the left and the sum of the two is considered.
Denoting with F the average length of a fragment in the DNA library, the
amount of this shift is about F /2, which yields the input signal:

[(17) = P(p — F/2) + N(p + F/2).

In case of single-end sequencing data, usually the average fragment length
needs to be estimated from the data itself. This estimation can be carried
out by several available tools [such as Zhang et al. (2008b)]. However,
because of the mixed source nature of the data, we found the available
methods unsatisfactory when applied to histone marks, and therefore, as
part of NucHunter, we also provide a method for estimating the average
fragment length (described in Section 2.4).

2.2 Peak detection

In the peak detection step (see Fig. 2), a suitable ﬁlter is applied to the
input signal, followed by the detection of local maxima in the ﬁltered
signal and the analysis of the statistical signiﬁcance of these maxima.

smoothed using a ﬁlter with a certain impulse response, then the maxima
of the resulting signal are detected and non-signiﬁcant local maxima are
ﬁltered out

A ﬁlter (more precisely a linear time-invariant ﬁlter) is characterized by
a discrete signal K(p) called impulse response. Given an input signal 1(p),
the ﬁlter output 0(p) is the result of the following operation, called
convolution:

orp) = (I x Km = Z102 —j)K(j).

where the index j ranges over positions where K(j) is not 0.

The impulse response in our approach has been chosen according to
the following two criteria: ﬁrst, it must separate sharp peaks from more
spread out read distributions or non-enriched regions; second, it must
have good smoothing properties, so that the convoluted signal contains a
limited number of local maxima (Rice, 1944) and, therefore, the algo-
rithm returns fewer false positives. We chose as impulse response the
second derivative of a Gaussian density function, also known as the
Mexican hat wavelet (see Fig. 3):

. i2 j
K(t) = (l —;)e 27.

The Mexican hat wavelet removes from the Fourier spectrum of the input
signal both high- and low-frequency components (band-pass ﬁlter), which
is appropriate if we interpret high frequencies as random oscillations

because of noise or insufficient coverage, and low frequencies as broad
ambiguous peaks coming from a mixture of nucleosome positions, or as
local biases such as GC content or open chromatin. The wavelet is para-
metrized by the scale parameter a. In our studies, we chose a default value
of 50 for 0 because, in general, it corresponds to a good compromise
between calling too many peaks and merging closely spaced ones. The
parameter can also be ﬁtted to the dataset under consideration using the
method outlined in Section 2.4.

Obtaining the convoluted signal for large genomes poses computa-
tional problems. In fact, a long signal as impulse response results in
a slow convolution operation. In NucHunter the convolution has
been implemented using recursive ﬁlters, an efficient signal-processing
technique (Hale, 2006).

Once local maxima are extracted from the ﬁlter output, their statistical
signiﬁcance is assessed. To this end, we model the noise by assuming that
values of the input signal within a certain region are independent identi-
cally distributed random variables (rvs). Using this assumption, we derive
the mean and standard deviation of the convoluted signal, and we assign
a z-score to each local maximum. If 1(p) denotes the input signal, K(p) the
impulse response and 0(1)) the convoluted signal at position [7, let m(p)
and std(p) denote, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of the
input signal in a large region R that contains position [7, then the z-score
is given by:

The detected peaks are all those local maxima with a z-score above a
certain threshold. This z-score represents the strength of a peak, and a
user-defined threshold, whose default value is 3, speciﬁes how many
standard deviations above average the peaks’ strength must be.
Additionally, the peaks are assigned a fuminess score that represents
the degree of uncertainty about the peak position, given by the formula:

fuzziness (p) = l—ZOOTg.

where O”(p) denotes the second discrete derivative of the ﬁlter output.

z-score(p) =

2.3 Filtering and scoring

After a set of putative peaks has been derived, additional ﬁltering steps
are carried out when a control sample is available. They are all based on
the enrichment level of a peak, deﬁned as the total number of reads that

contribute to the input signal in a window of a certain size (by default
147 bp) centered around the peak.

Peaks are ﬁltered in a similar manner as in Zhang et al. (2008b): the
enrichment level is modeled as a Poisson rv whose parameter is estimated
from both a global and a local average of the control sample, which is
rescaled so that the number of sequenced reads in the two samples
matches. From this model a P-value is obtained, and peaks can be ﬁltered
based on a user-deﬁned threshold (which defaults to 10’5).

In more detail, let G denote the genome length. The noise level in
the control sample is rescaled according to the total coverage ratio

1k . .

or = %, so that the local and global nelse est1mates AW and Am,

k:eN W

. c k Ck

can be expressed, respectlvely, as 05% and 05%, and the
ﬁnal noise estimate A is chosen as the maximum between the two
(W defaults to 1000). Finally, the null model for the read counts in a
window of a ﬁxed radius R is given by:

F
E [(p + k) ~ Poiss((2F+ m).
k:7F
The next ﬁltering step consists in controlling the relative amount of posi-
tive and negative reads in the enrichment level, as highly unbalanced
contributions from the two strands are likely to arise from mapping
biases. Following the approach of Zhang et al. (2008a), we ﬁlter out
peaks where the ratio between the two contributions is not contained
in the interval [r, l/r], where r defaults to 4.

A ﬁnal step takes place when the sample is obtained from multiple
ChIP-seq experiments. In this case, the consensus input signals from the
different samples are added together, and the above steps are carried out
as if the signal came from a single experiment. After that, however, the
enrichment level at each peak is decomposed into the contributions of the
different experiments, and each of them is tested independently to assess
whether a certain histone modiﬁcation is present or not (see Fig. 4). The
tests are carried out using the same noise model and formulas shown
above, where now I corresponds to the consensus signal derived from
the single histone modiﬁcations.

Finally, for each nucleosome call the algorithm provides, along with
the genomic coordinates, the following statistics: (i) the z-soore (peak
strength), (ii) the input signal enrichment level (sum of the raw read

enrichment level (sum of the smoothed read counts in the same window),
(iv) a P-value derived from the comparison between input and control
enrichment levels (signiﬁcance of the enrichment) and (v) the fuzziness
score for the peak position. In case multiple samples are simultaneously
analyzed, it is also provided, for each input sample and each nucleosome
call, the contribution to the total enrichment level in terms of raw reads
and the result of the statistical test as an on/off ﬂag.

2.4 Inferring the average fragment length

The average fragment length F is typically inferred based on the strand
cross-correlation function, deﬁned as:

6600 = Z PmNrp + k).
P

where the index [7 spans all genomic positions. For point-source factors
and low noise levels the cross-correlation function usually has a peak at
position F (the ‘fragment peak’), as shown in Figure 5, which yields a
straightforward method for the estimation of F. However, for many his-
tone marks the cross-correlation plot is harder to interpret because of the
presence of a so-called phantom-peak (Landt et 01., 2012) and other sys-
tematic biases, which can sometimes completely obscure the fragment
peak (see Fig. Sb). To account for these biases, we introduce a modiﬁed
cross-correlation function that we call peak cross-correlation (pcc):

6500 = Z) 15(12er + k).
1’

The signals N and P are a dense representation of the peaks obtained
applying a peak detection algorithm to the strand-speciﬁc signals N and
P. More speciﬁcally, N and P are binary signals whose only non-zero
entries are ones occurring at the peaks’ locations. The peak detection
technique presented in Section 2.2 applied to the consensus signal I is
applied to the signals N and P.

The pcc function, which is used to infer F, can also indicate how ap-
propriate the choice of o is, where o is the parameter used for peak
detection (see Section 2.2). If N and P are assumed to be two replicates
of the same signal with a systematic shift of F base pairs in the nucleo-
some peaks, a good choice of a should result in a strong peak in the poo
function around position F, whereas a bad choice should lead to almost
independent peaks in the two strands and a ﬂat pcc function.

After the poo function is computed, a clustering technique is applied to
interpret it, which yields an estimate for F and a quality score for a. We
assume that the plot is generated by sampling from a mixture of three rvs:
a uniform rv to model the background noise, a Gaussian rv to model the
phantom peak and another Gaussian rv to model the fragment peak, as
shown in Figure Sc. The parameters of these distributions are inferred
using an expectation-maximization algorithm, and the mean of the
Gaussian rv corresponding to the fragment peak is used as an estimate
for the average fragment length. The quality score, which is derived from
the likelihood of the inferred model, can be computed for different values
of o and yields a score curve (see Section 1 in Supplementary Material for
more details).

power of our algorithm and to compare it with other available
tools, we ran NucHunter and two other tools [Nucleosome
Positioning from Sequencing (NPS) from Zhang et al. (2008a);
Template Filter from Weiner et a]. (2010)] on a H3K9ac dataset

excluded from the comparison either because they were not able
to deal with the large amount of data or because the results
obtained using default parameters were unsatisfactory. We
chose yeast because we wanted to compare the predictions to a
base pair resolution map of nucleosome positions in yeast
(Brogaard et al., 2012). This map has been obtained with a tech-
nique that, even if it has not been tested widely yet, is independ-
ent from ChIP-seq, and it is claimed to be more accurate.

In line with previous studies (Chung and Vingron, 2009), to
compare the nucleosome predictions with the nucleosome map,
we used the (normalized) area under the cumulative error curve
(AUC) as a performance measure. The AUC was obtained apply-
ing the following procedure (see also Supplementary Material):

(1) we consider the set of all distances between nucleosome
predictions and nucleosomes in the map <73 bp,

(2) we obtain a cumulative error curve. In such a curve, a
point (x, y) means that a fraction y of the distances is
less than x base pairs (see Supplementary Fig. S5),

(3) we compute the AUC and we normalize it, so that a set of
perfect predictions has an AUC of 1 and a random set of
genomic positions has an expected AUC of 0.5.

Along with the AUC, we also computed the sensitivity and the
speciﬁcity, defined, respectively, as the fraction of nucleosomes in
the map that are closer than 20 bp to a nucleosome prediction
and the fraction of nucleosome predictions that are closer than
20 bp to a nucleosome in the map. Moreover, to account for the
great variability in the number of predictions returned by each
tool, we repeated the performance measurements for different
score thresholds.

The results from Figure 6 show that NucHunter makes more
accurate predictions compared with the other tools. Considering
the default score thresholds, NucHunter and NPS return a similar
number of predictions but the former has an higher AUC than the
second, whereas Template Filter returns many more predictions

and of lower quality. When the score threshold is increased, the
AUC difference between NucHunter and NPS becomes much
more pronounced. This suggests that the nucleosome predictions
with highest score from NucHunter are, in general, much more
precise compared with those from the other tools. All the tools
suffer from low sensitivity in this dataset, in particular NucHunter
and NPS when the default score thresholds are used.

The reasons for unidentiﬁed nucleosomes or incorrect predic-
tions can be many. In the ﬁrst place, the experimental procedures
used for the ChIP-seq experiment and that used for the nucleo-
some map are different. Roughly 5.6% of the nucleosomes in
the map, for instance, are located in low-mappability regions
and are not covered by any read. Moreover, the ChIP-seq
experiment targeted only acetylated nucleosomes, as opposed
to the nucleosome map. A more general problem is the identiﬁ-
cation of fuzzily positioned nucleosomes. If the nucleosome
positioning varies extensively from cell to cell, the assumptions
made by the algorithms are violated and nucleosomes are hard
to identify. Lastly, both speciﬁcity and sensitivity are affected
from high noise levels, insufﬁcient sequencing coverage and
sequencing biases.

In addition to the yeast dataset, we also tested the algorithms
on a simulated dataset and on different histone modiﬁcation
ChIP-seq files in human K562 cells. In the simulated dataset,
the nucleosome map is randomly generated and the reads are
generated accordingly. Because there is no nucleosome map
for the human dataset, we used pairs of replicate experiments
and pairs of different histone modiﬁcations as gold standard-pre-
dictions pairs. The details of the simulation and the performance
evaluations are reported in Supplementary Material in Sections 3
and 4. In general, the results are in agreement with those
shown previously. In the Supplementary Material, it is also
shown that NucHunter runs faster and requires less memory
than the other two algorithms (see Supplementary Material
Section 5).

3.2 Clustering of nucleosomes based on histone marks

We ran NucHunter on a composite dataset from a human leu-
kemia cell line [K562, Myers et a]. (2011)] consisting of a control
experiment and 12 ChIP-seq experiments for different histone
modiﬁcations. For each detected nucleosome and for each ex-
periment the algorithm returned, along with other statistics, the
raw read count within a window of a speciﬁed width (which
defaults to 147) around the inferred nucleosome location (see
Methods).

We used these read counts for an exploratory analysis of the
chromatin landscape. After a normalization procedure that cor-
rects the read counts taking into account the control sample, the
different sequencing depths of the datasets and the nucleosome
abundance at each locus, we obtained a joint histone modiﬁca-
tion level distribution and we applied the k-means clustering al-
gorithm on it (see Supplementary Material for more details).
Given a parameter k, this unsupervised learning method aims
at partitioning the data points into k different families (clusters)
such that elements in the same cluster are as similar to each other
as possible. Each cluster is characterized by its centroid, which is,
in our case, a prototypical histone modiﬁcation pattern.

We found that with k equals 6 the results are robust, whereas
for higher values of the parameter the clusters tend to change
depending on the initialization (see Supplementary Material).
Moreover and most importantly, we found that such a partition-
ing, derived solely from the histone modiﬁcation patterns,
can also capture biologically meaningful positional features
of the nucleosomes. We assigned labels to each cluster based
on the histone modification pattern and genomic localization.
The labeled centroids are shown in Figure 7.

We studied the genomic localization of nucleosomes from
the different clusters using the RefSeq annotation dataset as
well as publicly available data from cap analysis of gene expres-
sion (CAGE) and DNase I hypersensitivity sequencing experi-
ments (Myers et al., 2011). We performed the following analyses
(further discussed in Supplementary Material): (i) we derived a
consensus nucleosome profile along genes by considering a large
set of annotated genes, by rescaling their nucleosome proﬁles to
the same length and by adding them up (Fig. 8a); (ii) we analyzed
the nucleosome positioning around promoters of active genes by
considering the distribution of distances between CAGE tags
and nucleosomes (Fig. 8b); and (iii) we obtained the average
DNase I hypersensitivity proﬁle around nucleosomes for each
class (Fig. 8c).

Overall these data give a clear picture of the nucleosome land-
scape and recapitulate previous knowledge (see Fig. 7). The nu-
cleosomes in the first family are characterized by a strong
enrichment of H3K4me2/3 and H3K9ac, and they tend to
reside in the 5’ portion of a gene near the transcriptional start
site (TSS; Fig. 8a). Thus, we labeled them ‘promoter’ nucleo-
somes. In proximity of promoters of active genes, these nucleo-
somes exhibit a strikingly regular pattern (Fig. 8b), whose main
features are a nucleosome-depleted region right upstream the
TSS and a well-positioned nucleosome 170 bp downstream (the
+1 nucleosome). The second and third clusters show an enrich-
ment of H3K4mel and H2AZ as well as a general enrichment of
active marks, whereas TSS-associated histone marks, such as
H3K4me2/3 and H3K9ac, are less enriched compared with the
promoter cluster. These features, together with the high levels of

Fig. 7. Using the k-means algorithm, 422 547 nucleosomes called by
NucHunter were clustered into six clusters: promoter (20.4%), enhancer
1 (19.8%), enhancer 2 (14.4%), elongation early (16.4%), elongation late
(14.7%) and repressed (14.3%). The rows of the heatmap represent the
centroids of the clusters and the columns represent the histone modiﬁca-
tions. The labels have been assigned based on prior biological knowledge

DNase I hypersensitivity that we observe (Fig. 8c), suggest that
these nucleosomes may ﬂank enhancer sequences. Thus, we
labeled them as ‘enhancer 2’ and ‘enhancer l’ nucleosomes.
The fourth centroid is enriched in H3K79me2 and H4K20me1,
whereas the fifth centroid is enriched in H3K36me3 and
H3K9me1, which are all histone marks related to elongation of
RNA polymerase II (Vavouri and Lehner, 2012). The localiza-
tion of these two classes of elongation nucleosomes along the
gene body, shown in Figure 8a, suggests that the 5th centroid
is enriched toward the 3’ end of a gene, whereas the 4th centroid
is enriched more to the 5’ end. Thus, we termed them ‘elongation
early’ and ‘elongation late’ nucleosomes, respectively. The last
centroid is characterized by an enrichment of H3K9me3 and
H3K27me3, suggesting that it represents chromatin-repressed
genomic regions (Margueron and Reinberg, 2011). Thus, we
termed it ‘repressed’.

Lastly, we explored the relation between the different clusters
that we obtained and a previously published study (Ernst and
Kellis, 2010) that aimed at classifying the chromatin landscape
into discrete states. Even though the last method uses a more
complex model, different data sources and positional relations
between histone modification patterns, we found that the overall
results are comparable (see Supplementary Material). We believe
that the joint analysis of histone modiﬁcation patterns and
nucleosome positioning that NucHunter allows for provides
complementary information and offers a greater potential than
histone modiﬁcation studies based on arbitrary binning schemes
of the genome.

4 DISCUSSION

The fast-paced development of chromatin immunoprecipitation—
based techniques is heading toward an increased spatial reso-
lution for DNAeprotein interactions. In line with this trend,
we developed NucHunter, a software for base pair resolution
nucleosome identification in ChIP-seq experiments. The innova-
tive aspects of this tool reside in a more accurate and efficient
signal processing, an improved statistical analysis of the peaks,
the possibility of integrating data from a control sample and to
consider multiple histone modiﬁcations at once.

We put forward a nucleosome-centric view, because if we view
the modifications (either sequentially or in a combinatorial pat-
tern) as a reﬂection of a signaling activity then nucleosomes can

be viewed as ‘signaling modules’ (Turner, 2012). In agreement
with this idea, we found that nucleosomes can be clustered into
distinct subgroups. These subgroups either mark certain func-
tional regions of the genome, such as promoters and enhancers,
or are related to biological processes, such as elongation or chro-
matin-mediated repression. Although this is not a new ﬁnding
[see Ernst and Kellis (2010)], we think that our approach has the
benefit of assigning the data to a physical entity that carries
the information: the nucleosome. Thus, separation of different
histone modiﬁcation patterns into distinct subgroups becomes
much more meaningful than by arbitrarily binning the genome
into non-overlapping windows (Ernst and Kellis, 2010), where
two nucleosomes with different modiﬁcation patterns could
be present.

In summary, we developed a new tool called NucHunter that is
able to identify positioned nucleosomes along the genome using
ChIP-seq data of histone modiﬁcations and annotates each nu-
cleosome with (i) a ﬂag indicating presence or absence of a certain
histone modiﬁcation and (ii) the number of contributing reads (if
one is interested in a more quantitative view). We demonstrated
that NucHunter performs better than currently available tools
and has some features not present in any of them. By focusing
on the nucleosome as information carrier, charting the epigenome
will become much more meaningful and will in the long run allow
for unraveling novel chromatin-mediated mechanisms.

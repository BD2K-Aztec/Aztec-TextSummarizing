ABSTRACT

Motivation: Animal models are important tools in drug discovery and
for understanding human biology in general. However, many drugs
that initially show promising results in rodents fail in later stages of
clinical trials. Understanding the commonalities and differences be-
tween human and rat cell signaling networks can lead to better ex-
perimental designs, improved allocation of resources and ultimately
better drugs.

Results: The sbv IMPROVER Species-Specific Network Inference
challenge was designed to use the power of the crowds to build
two species-specific cell signaling networks given phosphoproteo-
mics, transcriptomics and cytokine data generated from NHBE and
NRBE cells exposed to various stimuli. A common literature-inspired
reference network with 220 nodes and 501 edges was also provided
as prior knowledge from which challenge participants could add or
remove edges but not nodes. Such a large network inference chal-
lenge not based on synthetic simulations but on real data presented
unique difficulties in scoring and interpreting the results. Because any
prior knowledge about the networks was already provided to the par-
ticipants for reference, novel ways for scoring and aggregating the
results were developed. Two human and rat consensus networks
were obtained by combining all the inferred networks. Further analysis
showed that major signaling pathways were conserved between the
two species with only isolated components diverging, as in the case of
ribosomal 86 kinase RPSBKA1. Overall, the consensus between
inferred edges was relatively high with the exception of the down-
stream targets of transcription factors, which seemed more difficult
to predict.

1 INTRODUCTION

Unveiling the inner workings of cell signaling networks is one of
the long-standing challenges of systems biology. Small-scale ver-
sions of these networks have been built edge by edge using classic
laboratory techniques such as immunoprecipitation, which has
resulted in a large body of literature describing various gene and
protein interactions. Although successful in their initial scope,
these methods do not scale up to the genome level and are dif-
ficult to combine into a larger network, because of the different
contexts in which they were originally reported. Organism, cell
type, experiment timing and other conditions are crucial for
determining whether an edge exists in a signaling network.

The advent of large-scale assays that can simultaneously meas-
ure the activity of thousands of genes has circumvented these
aforementioned issues by enabling purely data-driven methods
to infer large-scale networks. Various algorithms have been de-
veloped, including models based on Bayesian networks (Perrin
et al., 2003), mutual information (Margolin et al., 2006), regres-
sion (Bonneau et al., 2006), neural networks om et al., 2004),
Boolean networks (Mitsos et al., 2009) and differential equations
(Chen et al., 1999). Despite these advances, there is no clear best
method. Each method has strengths and limitations influenced
by how the methodology addresses the fact that network infer-
ence is inherently an underdetermined problem in the majority of
cases (Marbach et al., 2012; De Smet and Marchal, 2010).
However, it has been observed that the aggregation of different
network inference methods generates high-quality robust results
(Marbach et al., 2012).

Efforts to catalog and compare network inference algorithms
have occurred in the form of data prediction competitions such
as the ones organized by the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering
Assessments and Methods (DREAM) consortium (Stolovitzky
et al., 2007). DREAM challenges participants to reconstruct cell
signaling networks from gene expression datasets. Predicted net-
works are then evaluated based on a subset of known inter-
actions, or the complete network in cases where the
corresponding gene expression data were generated in silico
(i.e. simulated).

A crowd-sourcing approach

 

DREAM is part of a larger group of successful crowd-sour-
cing initiatives in systems biology alongside CASP [critical as-
sessment of protein structure prediction (Moult et al., 1995)],
CAFA [critical assessment of function annotation (Radivojac
et al., 2013)], CAPRI [critical assessment of prediction of inter-
actions (Janin et al., 2003)], FlowCAP [critical assessment of
automated ﬂow cytometry data analysis techniques
(Aghaeepour et al., 2013)] and Foldit [predicting protein struc-
ture with a multiplayer online game (Cooper et al., 2010)]. In the
same spirit as these academic initiatives, sbv IMPROVER is a
crowd-sourcing-based methodology for the veriﬁcation of re-
search in an industrial setting (Meyer et al., 2012). In its
second installment, it challenges the research community to
solve four problems related to the translation of molecular biol-
ogy findings between rat and human model systems
(thissorrakrai et al., 2015).

Here we present the analysis of the Species-Speciﬁc Network
Inference challenge, part of the sbv IMPROVER Species
Translation set of challenges (https://www.sbvimprover.com).
For this challenge, participants were asked to infer human-
and rat-speciﬁc networks given phosphoprotein, gene expression
and cytokine data (Fig. l). The organizers also provided a
common reference network from which participants had to
generate the two networks by adding and removing edges. The
purpose of this challenge was to augment and reﬁne the reference
map in a species-specific manner using data-driven approaches.

2 METHODS

2.1 Evaluation of inferred networks

Most of the prior knowledge regarding the interactions between elements
in the cell signaling network was already incorporated in the reference
map provided to the challenge participants. Hence, this information
could not have been used as a gold standard against which to evaluate

inferred networks. To circumvent this issue, we proposed that the true
ranking of the submissions be viewed as a prediction problem in itself by
combining different scoring strategies. Rank-based aggregation of indi-
vidual predictions has been shown to provide robust results on par with
the best performing methods in other data prediction challenges (Bilal
et al., 2013; Marbach et al., 2012; Margolin et al., 2013). Drawing from
this result, the predicted networks were evaluated using softer methods
that did not involve the use of a gold standard where the ﬁnal ranks were
derived by simply averaging the ranks obtained using the different scoring
strategies.

The ﬁrst scoring method involved the use of a published network in-
ference algorithm (Mitsos et al., 2009) to generate a ‘silver standard’
network against which all submissions were evaluated. This is mainly a
pruning algorithm, hence only the subnetworks that intersected the ref-
erence network were scored. The following metrics were considered for
this purpose: the z-score of the Jaccard similarity (JS), Matthews correl-
ation coefﬁcient (MCC) and the difference between the true-positive rate
and false-positive rate (TPR-FPR) (Jaccard, 1912; Powers, 2007). In add-
ition, two versions of the silver standard were generated: one that was
trained on only the data available to the participants and one that
also made use of part of the dataset that was kept hidden from partici-
pants and used as the gold standard in the other Species Translation
challenges.

For another scoring method, the write-ups describing the methodology
used for making the predictions were scored based on the following
criteria: rigor, deﬁned as the soundness of the proposed methodology
based on valid statistics, arguments and premises without gaps in a lo-
gical, well-deﬁned sequence of procedural steps; originality, deﬁned as
novelty in concept when compared with existing methods and typical
approaches in the field; and practical implementation, deﬁned as the
ability to instantiate the proposed methods with existing or clearly
described novel algorithms and commonly used computer architectures,
the use of data sources commonly available to the ﬁeld and a reasonable
execution time. Three independent evaluators blindly assigned scores ran-
ging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good) for each criterion, and then the
ﬁnal score was obtained by adding these points and then averaging
among the evaluators.

2.2 The reference network

The reference network represents an ensemble of canonical pathways and
was built following a top-down multi-layer hierarchical architecture start-
ing with the stimulus layer through multiple signaling cascades to the
transcription factor (TF) and secreted cytokine layers (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Only stimuli with known mode of action present in subset A
(training dataset) were included in the reference network.

The signaling cascade layer connected stimuli to latent (i.e. not mea-
sured) and measured (phosphoproteins) nodes representative of a mem-
brane-to-nucleus protein signaling cascade (i.e., from stimuli to TF via
kinase proteins). The identiﬁcation and prioritization of latent nodes and
edges (connectivity between stimuli, latent nodes and measured nodes)
were conducted using various biological pathway databases (e.g. KEGG,
Biocarta) and the ensemble network published by Kirouac et a]. (2012),
embodying the union of several online pathway databases. The network
was traversed using a depth-ﬁrst search algorithm, computing its transi-
tive closure and identifying paths. Latent nodes that were not transitively
connected to a stimulus or a measured node were removed. Additional
latent nodes were identiﬁed based on topological features of the ensemble
network. These highly connected nodes (counting the largest amount of
incoming and outgoing connections) with a minimum overlap between
them were identiﬁed using standard k-means clustering and integrated in
the reference network.

For the TF layer, TFs corresponding to a subset of measured nodes
and selected latent nodes were connected to a subset of target genes.
These genes were identiﬁed using the Transcriptional Regulatory
Element Database (Jiang et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2005).

The cytokine layer was constructed by connecting target genes to cor-
responding measured cytokines. The ﬁnal step included a manual veriﬁ-
cation and curation of the reference network to prune and reﬁne it using
literature reviews and various pathway databases (e.g. Biocarta, KEGG).

2.3 The silver standard network

The construction of the silver standard networks was based on a method
developed by Mitsos et a]. (Melas et al., 201 1; Mitsos et al., 2009). The outline
of this approach is to use Boolean logic to model signal transduction and
integer linear programming (ILP) to ﬁt the model to the data. In particular,
Boolean logic was used to represent signal transduction in a prior knowledge
network (i.e. reference network) to create a model capable of predicting the
state of a node in a given experiment. Because Boolean models are limited to
qualitative predictions, discretization of the experimental data was necessary.
The discretization of the datasets was done by use of double threshold func-
tions. In particular, the thresholds were set at :l:2-fold changes for the gene
expression data, :l:3 standard residuals for the phosphoproteomics data and
:l:2 standard residuals for the cytokine data. The initial choice of thresholds
was done in accordance with the processing methods used for the different
data types as described in Poussin et a]. (2014). In addition, a sensitivity
analysis was performed to ensure that the ﬁnal network would be robust
on slight variations of the thresholds.

ILP was further used to combine the Boolean model with the experimen-
tal data by formulating an optimization problem that sought to minimize the
mismatches between the predictions derived from the ﬁnal network and the
data at hand. The optimization procedure was performed by removing re-
actions from the reference network that were contradicted by the data and
thus created a smaller data-speciﬁc network. More details about the silver
standard model are available in the Supplementary Material.

2.4 The consensus network

The predictions from each of the M challenge participants can be orga-
nized as a binary vector xj =(x1j, x2], ..., xNj) wherej= 1...M and N is the
total number of possible edges, while the unknown gold standard net-
work is represented as the vector y : (yl , y2, ..., yN). Each element xi]- or y,-
can either be 1 (edge exists) or 0 (edge does not exist).

Let PT be the probability that a method predicts the existence of an
edge given that the edge exists, and P; the probability of predicting the
existence of an edge given that the edge does not exist. If X,- and Y are
random variables with realizations xj and y, respectively, then X ,-| Y: 1~
Bernoulli(PT) and X ,-| Y: 0~ Bernoulli(PF). Assuming that the predictions
are independent given the true edge label, then the conditional distribu-
tions of the sum X = X1 +X2 -l- ...-l-X M are modeled by the Binomial
distributions:

Pr (X=k| Y: 1): (:4)P;(1 —PT)M”‘ (1)

Pr (X=k|Y=0)= (:4)P’}(1 —PF)M”‘ (2)

where k is effectively the number of ‘votes’ received by an edge.
Therefore, the probability density function that k teams picked the
same edge is as follows:

N

[TIEPr(X=k|Y=0) (3)

 

Pr(X=k)= §Pr(X=k|Y=1)-i-

where E is the number of true edges.

The Equations (1) and (2) assume the performance of predictions is
constant, modeled by parameters PT and PF; however, this is not true in
practice. The variation in prediction performance between different algo-
rithms can be modeled by imposing PT and PF to follow Beta distribu-
tions, normally used to model random variables limited to intervals of
ﬁnite length. Consequently, the conditional probability functions in
Equations (1) and (2) become the Beta-Binomial compound distributions:

= = = M B(k+al,M—k+b1)

Pr(X k|Y 1) (k ) —B(al, b1) (4)
= = = M B(k+az,M—k+b2)

Pr(X k|Y 0) < k ) —B(az, b2) (5)

where PT follows the beta distribution B(a1,b1) with shape parameters a1
and b1, and PF follows the beta distribution B(a2,b2) with shape param-
eters a2 and b2.

The model described by the Equations (3), (4) and (S) can be ﬁtted to
the distribution of the data comprising the number of times each edge was
present among the different proposed networks. An optimal consensus
network can be reconstructed using all the predictions by ﬁnding the
minimum number of votes per edge that satisﬁes the condition
Pr(Y: 1|X= k) > Pr(Y: 0|X= k). This threshold can be easily
found by numerically solving the following equation:

Pr (Y: 1|X=k) _ Pr (X=k|Y= 1)Pr (Y: 1) _
Pr (Y=0|X=k) T Pr (X=k|Y=0)Pr (Y=0) T

 

(6)

where Pr(Y = 1) and Pr(Y = 0) are prior probabilities related to the true
number of edges in the network:

Pr(Y=1)= (7)

Elm

Pr(Y=0)=1—% (8)

3 RESULTS

The described methodology for building the reference network
created a directed graph with 220 nodes and 501 edges organized
into cascading layers where the edges are oriented from the top
to the bottom layers. At the top is the stimulus layer that

contains a subset of the compounds used to generate the training
data, followed by receptor, adaptor, signaling, TF, target and
cytokine layers (Supplementary Fig. S2). It is interesting to
note that not all the TFs are reachable from all the stimuli
nodes. The addition of a top stimuli layer to an otherwise generic
network introduces the notion of context to pathways that are
only active under certain conditions.

By mapping the nodes from the reference network to the genes
from the canonical pathways listed in the Molecular Signature
Database V3.1 (Subramanian et al., 2005), we observe a diverse
representation of cellular processes. Among the most common
were cell growth and survival (EGF, INSULIN, PDGF and
RAS), interleukin (ILIR, 1L3 and IL4), inﬂammatory response
(NFKB) and cell signaling (MAPK) as shown in Figure 2.

add extra nodes. The purpose of this was to make submissions
comparable and to put some boundaries that were relevant to the
experiments performed. It is interesting to note that most pro-
posed networks were built by removing edges from the reference
network rather than adding additional interactions, which led to
a bigger consensus on the existence of edges that were already
part of the reference network. (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4).
The median number of edges of the proposed networks was 406
for human and 429 for rat compared with 501 edges of the ref-
erence network.

In the case of the silver standard, two versions of the networks
were considered: one that relied only on the training dataset and
numbered 131 edges for human and 175 for rat, and one that
used the full dataset (training and testing sets) and numbered 114
edges for human and 162 edges for rat. The J S between the two
silver standards was 0.50 for human and 0.67 for rat. However,
when using the two silver standard versions to evaluate the sub-
missions, the scores obtained were very similar (Supplementary
Table $1). This led to the decision to use only the ﬁrst proposal,
which used the same data as the challenge participants.

The heatmaps in Figure 3 show the similarity between pre-
dicted networks together with the silver standard using MCC
in the space of the reference network edges. Both panels suggest
an emerging pattern where a few of the networks are more simi-
lar to each other and to the silver standard. The same can be
observed when looking at the number of edges that overlaps
between the different networks (Supplementary Tables S2 and
S3). These are the networks that were ranked higher independent
of the scoring metric used (i.e., JS, MCC or TPR-FPR)
(Supplementary Table S4).

The second method for evaluating submissions used the scores
obtained by the accompanying write-ups describing the algo-
rithms used to build the species-specific networks. The scores
listed in Supplementary Table SS are separated by criterion (ori-
ginality, rigor, practical implementation) and show remarkable
consistency between reviewers. In the end, the ﬁnal ranking was

calculated by averaging the ranks obtained by each team for the
two scoring methods and are listed in Supplementary Table S6.

All the predicted networks can be used to construct a consen-
sus network by keeping the edges chosen by at least a predeter-
mined number of teams. Supplementary Figure S5 shows how all
the participating teams would have fared against a consensus
network constructed using different thresholds from three to
seven teams. Because two of the teams had similar entries (Fig.
3), one of them was discarded (Team 93) to avoid bias when the
consensus network was built. It is worth noting that the top
performing teams determined by consensus scoring using large
thresholds (Teams 116 and 55) were the same as the ones that
were the challenge best performers according to Supplementary
Table S6. In contrast, the performance of lower ranked teams
was less consistent between the different scoring strategies.

3.2 Optimal consensus network

The optimal threshold for building the consensus network was
determined by ﬁtting the model described in Section 2
(Equations 3, 4, and 5) followed by solving Equation 6. The
data used for the ﬁt were assembled by counting the number
of ‘Votes’ received by each edge in the reference network from
the participating teams (excluding Team 93) and the silver stand-
ard network. This was performed separately for human and rat
networks, and then the resulting datasets were mixed to improve
the fit. Maximizing the log likelihood function of the mixture of
two beta-binomial distributions (Equation 3) for different mixing
constants led to Pr(Y = I) = 0.16, Pr(Y = 0) = 0.84 (Fig. 4A)
and shape parameters a; = 8.77e-l-06, b; = 1.95e+06,
a2 = 3.46e-l-06 and b2 = 1.57e-l-06. Using this result and after
solving Equation 6, it was found that it takes approximately
eight votes to verify the condition Pr(Y = I|X = k) >
Pr(Y = 0|X = k). This result can also be Visualized in
Figure 4B by tracing the intersection of the two mixture compo-
nents depicted in black.

The model was tested on two additional datasets and showed a
good overall fit (Supplementary Fig. S6). In the first case, the

edge counts shown in Figure 4B were extended to all possible
edges, including the ones not present in the reference network. In
the second case, a completely new set of network predictions was
obtained from DREAM 3 (Prill et al., 2010). For this challenge,
27 participants had to predict de novo a synthetic network with
50 nodes and 82 edges from simulated gene expression data with-
out knowing the identity of the nodes.

3.3 Conservation and divergence of human and rat cell
signaling networks

Using the threshold determined in the previous section, two con-
sensus networks were built for human and rat using the networks
predicted by participants together with the silver standard. The
individual edges that resulted are depicted in Supplementary
Figure S7 and color-coded based on their presence in the
human, rat or both consensus networks. The number and the
size of the resulting connected components are listed in
Supplementary Table S7. Two of these subnetworks are shown
in Figure 5 panels A and B as examples of predicted differences
between human and rat cell signaling networks. Although there
were plenty of edges that were active only in human or rat, these
differences were rather isolated. The differences between human
and rat did not scale up to the level of pathways or other higher
levels of organization, as will be reinforced in the following
analysis.

For any group of edges, a consensus score can be calculated by
averaging the individual scores associated with each edge, which
is simply the percentage of times the edge was predicted to exist.
Here we assume that consensus between participants regarding
an edge is associated with higher probability that the edge is real.
The panel C in Figure 5 shows the average consensus scores
of the edges between consecutive layers for human and rat
together with the associated standard errors. Although there
were no significant differences between human and rat, the over-
all consensus for the edges downstream of TFs seemed to be
much lower than the rest, suggesting that these edges were
more difﬁcult to predict. The consensus scores of the edges in

the canonical pathways listed in Figure 2 also showed no signiﬁ-
cant differences between human and rat (Supplementary Fig.
88A).

The conservation of phosphoprotein activity was measured by
calculating the average consensus score of all edges adjacent to a
phosphoprotein node (Supplementary Fig. S8B). From all the
proteins measured, RPS6KAI had a significantly higher consen-
sus score in human (P—Value = 0.0161) and WNKI had a signiﬁ-
cantly higher consensus score in rat (P—Value = 0.0498).
Similarly, the conservation of TF activity was assessed by calcu-
lating the consensus score of the edges upstream of a TF
(Supplementary Fig. 88C) and then downstream of it
(Supplementary Fig. S8D). Edges upstream of STAT] had a
higher consensus score in human than in rat
(P—Value = 0.0004), whereas edges downstream of M YC also
showed a higher consensus score in human (P—Value = 0.0287).
Significantly higher consensus scores in rat were found for edges
downstream of TCF3, GLIZ and SMAD3 (P-Values = 8.8-e06,
0.0287 and 0.0156).

4 DISCUSSION

The scope of sbv IMPROVER Species Translation challenges
was to assess the limits of using rat models to predict human
biology in the speciﬁc context of bronchial epithelial cells
exposed to various stimuli. Along these lines, the rationality
behind the Network Inference challenge was to build two spe-
cies-speciﬁc cell signaling networks starting from a generic litera-
ture-inspired network and using high-throughput proteomics
and transcriptomics data to add or reject edges. This challenge
differed from other challenges because it did not come with a
gold standard (i.e. the true human and rat networks are un-
known) and this posed difﬁculties in scoring and interpreting
the results. The current work details how the aforementioned
issues were addressed together with the lessons learned from
organizing and curating such a challenge.

Despite the apparent top-down organization of the reference
network, some feedback loops were present consistent with the
structure of known pathways. However, the challenge

experiments were designed to capture a broad area of the signal-
ing network and not feedback mechanisms. The latter would
have required a different experimental setup with more samples
collected at later time points, as feedback loops tend to be more
prominent at longer time scales.

Without a gold standard, individual scoring criteria can poten-
tially be useful in separating poor performers from good per-
formers, but can also have flaws. The silver standard is biased
by the choice of algorithm used to generate it, and the quality of
the write-ups does not always predict the best performing
algorithms. It is thus advisable to combine the rankings resulting
from individual scoring methods to reduce bias. The best
performers obtained in this manner were the same as the ones
obtained by comparing predictions with a consensus network
built by aggregating the submissions from all participants. This
result suggests that consensus scoring could be used as a legitimate
scoring strategy for future challenges where a gold standard is
absent.

The network aggregation procedure described in this article
provides a statistically sound way of merging predicted networks
or any other binary predictions given a sufﬁciently large sample
space. This is especially useful when a clear way of assessing the
best performing method is absent. However, even when one can
accurately determine the best algorithm for performing a speciﬁc
task, the result might be context dependent. It has been shown
that disease classiﬁers vary greatly in performance when applied
to different datasets (Tarca et al., 2013). Aggregating multiple
predictions has been proven to generate a more robust outcome
on par with the best performing methods (Bilal et al., 2013;
Marbach et al., 2012).

The generation of a consensus prediction can potentially have
benefits beyond that of robustness and performance, particularly
in the absence of a gold standard. The data shown in
Supplementary Figure S5 suggest that predictions can be
scored against a consensus network instead of using a silver
standard, with similar top rankings when an appropriate thresh-
old is used. Consensus scoring can thus avoid any bias caused by
the choice of algorithm for the silver standard; however, it could
be sensitive to outliers (e. g. predictions that are much better than

the rest), or multiple correlated predictions caused by collaborat-
ing teams or the use of similar methods.

The predicted networks were aggregated using a mixture of
two beta-binomial distributions as shown in Section 2. To ﬁnd
the optimal threshold for determining the existence of an edge, a
two-step process was used. First, the distribution in Equation 3
was ﬁtted to the consensus data; then the minimum number of
teams k was determined for which Pr(Y = I|X = k) >
Pr(Y = 0|X = k). From the ﬁrst step, the value of the mixture
constant Pr(Y= 1) (Equation 7) can give an indication of the
proportion of true edges in the reference network which in this
case was 16%. Despite this, the solution to the second step re-
sulted in consensus networks with 7.4% edges for human and
6.7% edges for rat out of all the reference network edges. This
result suggests that less than half of the potential regulatory con-
nections were discovered and more challenge participants were
needed to increase statistical power and reconcile the two esti-
mates of the number of true edges.

Despite these limitations, the consensus network shown in
Supplementary Figure S7 displays some interesting patterns,
some of which are shown in Figure 5A and B. Overall, the
CAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1, also known as
CREBI, showed the best consensus for the edges upstream of
it (Supplementary Fig. S8C) but with a couple of differences
between human and rat: the connection from RPS6KAI was
present only in the human consensus network (Fang et al.,
2005), whereas the connection from PRKACA was present
only in the rat consensus network (Wang et al., 2006). The preva-
lence of RPS6KAI (a.k.a. RSKI) interactions in human
(Supplementary Fig. S8B) might be explained by the fact that
human isoforms of RSKl have functional redundancy (i.e.
RPS6KA3 [RSKZ]; RPS6KA2 [RSK3]; and RPS6KA6 [RSK4]).
In contrast, this is most likely not the case in rodents; Zeniou
et al. (2002) reported that the mouse RSKI and RSK3 genes may
not be able to fully compensate for the lack of RSKZ function.

The consensus results also suggest a preference for JAKI ac-
tivation through EGFR for human and the PDGFR complex for
rat. Direct interaction between JAKI and IRS] has been re-
ported in cultured human peripheral blood T cells (Johnston
et al., 1995). In rat, however, the interaction seems to be indirect
through proteins SOCSZ, SOCS3 and JAKZ (Calegari et al.,
2003; Park et al., 2000). Other conserved interactions include
IFNGRI to JAKZ and JAKZ to STAT5A, which are parts of
the interferon gamma pathway known to be conserved across
vertebrate species (Pestka et al., 2004).

Additional references are provided for the majority of edges
from the consensus networks and are available as Supplementary
Material. These references are categorized by organism and
tissue context as follows: airway cells, non-lung cells and lung
cancer epithelial cells. Although numerous pathway databases
are widely available, they are too generic and lack speciﬁc con-
text when displaying an interaction. The purpose of this chal-
lenge was to ﬁne tune one of these generic networks based on
data collected from bronchial primary cells exposed to speciﬁc
stimuli (compounds). When comparing the resulting consensus
network to networks obtained from the Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis tool (IPA: www.ingenuity.com), we observe a steady
increase in precision as the number of votes required for an
edge increases (Supplementary Fig. S9), culminating at eight

votes as predicted by the model in Equation 6. The maximum
precision obtained is 0.33 for the human network and 0.09 for
the rat network. However, this could be explained by the rela-
tively few edges identified in IPA for human (69) and especially
rat (26) (the number of edges drastically decreased if a ﬁlter on
cell/tissue type was applied), as well as the lack of proper context
provided by tissue speciﬁcity and stimuli. The IPA networks as
well as the consensus networks are available as Supplementary
Material.

Overall, the fact that fewer suitable edge additions existed in
most inferred networks (Supplementary Fig. S3) indicates that
the reference network contains probably most of the true active
pathways in both species. However, as observed by the large
number of edge removals, it also contains many inactive path-
ways. In other words, the phosphoproteins represented by net-
work nodes were less responsive to some stimuli than expected
from the reference network. Furthermore, because most partici-
pants (and all top performers) used the reference network in their
models it is likely that expert/prior knowledge was critical for
optimal network construction.

The methods used by the participants to solve the challenge
were varied and included Bayesian networks, Boolean networks,
mutual information, lasso and elastic net, ANOVA and various
heuristics (more details on the individual algorithms are available
in the Supplementary Methods). It is interesting to note that
different ﬂavors of the same method, in this case Bayesian net-
works, do not perform similarly when applied to the same prob-
lem. When designing a prediction algorithm, a multitude of
choices were made, ranging from various constants and priors
to learning criteria and regularization options, which can lead to
vastly different outcomes. This justiﬁes efforts, such as the sbv
IMPROVER challenges or any of the other crowd-sourcing ini-
tiatives such as DREAM or CASP, to try and establish best
practices in the ever-changing field of computational biology.

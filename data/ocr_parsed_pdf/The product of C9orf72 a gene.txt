ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fronto-temporal dementia (FI'D) and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS, also called motor neuron disease, MND) are severe
neurodegenerative diseases that show considerable overlap at the
clinical and cellular level. The most common single mutation in families
with FTD or ALS has recently been mapped to a non-coding repeat
expansion in the uncharacterized gene CQORF72. Although a plaus-
ible mechanism for disease is that aberrant CQORF72 mRNA poisons
splicing, it is important to determine the cellular function of CQORF72,
about which nothing is known.

Results: Sensitive homology searches showed that CQORF72 is a
full-length distant homologue of proteins related to Differentially
Expressed in Normal and Neoplasia (DENN), which is a GDP/GTP
exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rab-GTPases. Our results sug-
gest that CQORF72 is likely to regulate membrane traffic in conjunction
with Rab-GTPase switches, and we propose to name the gene and its
product DENN-like 72 (DENNL72).

1 INTRODUCTION

Fronto—temporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral scler-
osis (ALS) are major neurodegenerative diseases that occur in
sporadic and familial forms, which show overlap in clinical pres-
entation and cytopathology (Dion et al., 2009). The commonest
cause of familial ALS, accounting for 2040%, maps to a muta-
tion in the gene C9ORF72 at 9p21 (DeJesus-Hernandez et al.,
2011; Renton et al., 2011). Mutation of C9ORF72 is also
common in patients with familial FTD (1&30%), sporadic
FTD (240%) and Alzheimer-like dementia (&4%) (Morris
et al., 2012). A single mutation is found: a massively expanded
GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in an intronic portion of the 5/
untranslated region. In the general population, alleles have a
median of two repeats (range: (L22), which are expanded in
pathogenic alleles to >1000 repeats. The pathogenetic mechan-
ism is unknown, but other neurological syndromes arise from
non-coding expansions. Pathology could occur Via poisoning of
splicing factors, in particular TDP—43, with non-coding repeats

inducing toxic RNA foci that sequester splicing factors and other
nuclear proteins (Todd and Paulson, 2010), as in Fragile X
Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) and myotonic dystrophy.
TDP—43 deposits and aberrant cytoplasmic mRNA foci in
C9ORF72 mutant cells both support a role for splicing
(DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011; Renton et al., 2011).
However, these are not universal findings (Simon-Sanchez
et al., 2012), and alternative mechanisms should be considered.
One possibility is that the expansion reduces translation, as in
Fragile X, consistent with reduced levels of C9ORF72 protein in
mutant cells (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011; Renton et al.,
2011). Despite its clinical relevance, the normal function of the
C9ORF72 protein has remained obscure.

A powerful way to determine protein function is to ﬁnd
homologies to proteins of known function. The sensitivity of
the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) has been
increased in several ways. Position-speciﬁc iterative (PSI)-
BLAST creates a profile of key residues from BLAST, and
then searches with increasingly large proﬁles to converge on a
ﬁnal stable alignment (Altschul et al., 1997). Sensitivity is im-
proved by proﬁleiproﬁle comparison, using proﬁles for every
database entry (Soding, 2005). Because structure diverges far
slower than primary sequence (Soding et al., 2005), a further
enhancement is to include secondary structural prediction in all
profiles. The tool HHpred allocates 15% of the profile weight-
ing at each residue to predicted structure: helix sheet or loop.
Importantly, HHpred searches targets not only in the Protein
Database (PDB) of solved structures, other databases of do-
mains, but also through proteome-wide libraries of model eu-
karyotes. Its enhanced proﬁleiproﬁle searches can ﬁnd
homologues that lack signiﬁcant amino acid conservation
even where no structure is solved, and no domain recognized
(Hayes et al., 2011).

DENN domain proteins (standing for ‘differentially expressed
in normal and neoplastic cells’) are highly conserved Rab-GEFs,
with large numbers of homologues in some species: humans have
16 in 7 subgroups (Marat et al., 2011; Yoshimura et al., 2010).
Using PSI-BLAST, several DENN-like families have been iden-
tiﬁed: DENND6 (FAM116), AVL9, Fam45A, LCHN, Aﬁlp
and Anr2p, some of which have GDP/GTP exchange factor
(GEF) activity (Linford et al., 2012). All DENN-like proteins
contain a domain of 4007500 aa (Marat et al., 2011), the struc-
ture of which consists of two lobes that associate intimately with
each other and Rab. The tripartite ‘domains’ of u-DENN,
c-DENN and d-DENN previously identiﬁed in silico had no

bearing on the structure, and we do not use this nomenclature
(Wu et al., 2011). The C—terminal domain makes 16 of 21 Rab
contacts, and this lobe is the active GEF. The N—terminal lobe
of DENNs adopts a longin domain (LD) ﬂﬂaﬂﬂﬂaa fold, also
found in SNAREs, small and medium coat subunits and three
types of GEF: three components of the TRAPP complex, both
of MONl/CCZl and fuzzy (FUZ) (Brooks and Wallingford,
2012; Gerondopoulos et al., 2012; Kinch and Grishin, 2006).
LDs, particularly as dimers, are highly conserved platforms
for GTPases, deriving from their circularly permuted ancestral
roadblock domain, found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
(Miertzschke et al., 2011).

Recently folliculin (FLCN), a tumour suppressor mutated in
BirtiHoggiDubé syndrome leading to renal cancers, which had
no homologies according to PSI-BLAST, was identiﬁed as a
structural and functional homologue of DENN (Nookala
et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011). Thus, DENN is the founder of a
family that is wider than can be appreciated using PSI-BLAST.
Here, we show that C9ORF72 is one of several previously unrec-
ognized full-length homologues of DENN proteins, suggesting
that C9ORF72 is a member of the DENN-like superfamily, and
hence a regulator of membrane trafﬁc.

2 METHODS

Online tools used were PSI-BLAST (NCBI), C1usta1W2 (EBI), PHYML
(T-rex), HHalign, HHpred and CLANS (MPG, Tuebingen). Default set-
tings were used, except in HHpred, which was set to eight iterations, and
where query-template alignments were realigned by a Maximum
Accuracy algorithm. To optimize HHpred specifically for queries with
C9ORF72 and FLCN, parameters were varied for individual searches
(see Supplementary Table S2). Protein structure was visualized in
QtMG (CCP4).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Domain structure of C9ORF72

PSI-BLAST seeded with human C9ORF72 converged on 103
sequences including some in protists, indicating that C9ORF72
was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor
(Supplementary Fig. SlA). Insects, plants and most fungi have
no C9ORF72, most other species have one, but there are highly
expanded sub-families in Entamoeba (7) and Trichomonas (10).
All C9ORF72s have 4007750 aa, and there are no partial homo-
logues. The most conserved residues are distributed throughout
the protein (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Such conservation
in a single block implies that C9ORF72 acts as one functional
unit. Because the primary sequence of C9ORF72 shows no
homologies, we used six independent structure prediction tools
to model C9ORF72 by comparison with the PDB library. Four
engines suggested multiple speciﬁc homologies, with the only
domains that appeared in the results of more than one tool
being: M16 peptidases (4), cytochrome bcl (2), glycohydrolases
(2) and DENN (5) (Supplementary Table S1). DENN is repre-
sented only twice in the database (11:85, 68 and 476 for the
other folds), but was identiﬁed by the greatest number of the
tools, suggesting a similarity of C9ORF72 to DENN.

3.2 C9ORF 72 is a full-length homologue of DENN
Rab-GEFs

We next used HHpred, which is ideal for detecting remote hom-
ology (Soding et al., 2005). This tool aligned the N—terminus of
C9ORF72 strongly to LCHN and AVL9, and after optimization
of the proﬁle used to generate alignments, a region of 1087229
amino acids near the N-terminus C9ORF72 indicated probability
of the same structure (p55) 2 82783% (Supplementary Fig. S3),
which suggests that C9ORF72 is homologous to the LD in the
N-terminus of DENNs.

Seeding a search with AVL9 (i.e. the reverse search) produced
a match that covered the entire length of C9ORF72, although
with moderate pSS (49%, Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S3),
indicating that the homology might extend to the C-terminus.
The C-terminus of C9ORF72 had its strongest matches
(pSS>90%) to FLCN-interacting proteins (FNIPs) 1 and 2,
which are regulators of metabolic signalling particularly in B
cells (Baba et al., 2006, 2012). The homology between
C9ORF72 and FNIPs extends across most of the protein
(Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that C9ORF72 and FNIP
are full-length homologues. The homology is strong enough to
allow the two proﬁles to be fully aligned using HHalign, which
indicated a signiﬁcant similarity (E-Value= 6 x 10—11)
(Supplementary Table S3). This is signiﬁcant because FNIP
also produces strong hits to DENN and FLCN (pSS=72 and
76%, Fig. 1B). Thus the indirect relationship Via FNIP validates
the link between the C—termini of C9ORF72 and DENNs. At the
N—terminus, another indirect relationship is found with nitrogen
permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2), a tumour suppressor that
regulates Tor (Neklesa and Davis, 2009). NPRL2 aligns strongly
to the N—termini of both C9ORF72 and LCHN (pSS=9l and
95%, Fig. 1B and data not shown), consistent with all three
having LDs. Overall, the predicted structural homologues of
C9ORF72 are either known DENN homologues, or proteins
closely related to them.

3.3 C9ORF72 shares full-length secondary structure and
primary sequence with DENNs

We next examined the predicted secondary structure of
C9ORF72 in detail. Its N—terminus aligns to AVL9 and
NPRL2, with an LD fold (ﬂﬂaﬂﬂﬂaa, Fig. 2A). The
C-terminus of C9ORF72 contains almost all the secondary struc-
tural elements of AVl9p, DENN and FLCN (Fig. 2A). Two fea-
tures absent in DENNDlB are found in both C9ORF72 and
FLCN: helix-6b (H6b) before sheet-7 (S7), and lack of H7.
The largest feature unique to C9ORF72 is an insertion of a
short H9b. C9ORF72 also shows full-length homology to
FNIPs, and a novel homologue we found for FLCN, the
SmithiMagenis candidate region 8 protein (SMcr8) implicated
in autophagy (Behrends et al., 2010) (Supplementary Fig. S4).
A sequence alignment of C9ORF72 with AVL9 and a DENN
showed greatest conservation coinciding with predicted struc-
tural elements (Supplementary Fig. S5). The binding site of
DENNs for Rabs has not been mapped directly, but 21 residues
in DENNDlB that are likely to be close to Rab have been
identified. However, only two contact residues are conserved be-
tween DENNDlB and other DENN-like proteins (212E and
213R) (Wu et al., 2011). These show partial conservation in
C9ORF72 (S/T230 and Q/C231, Supplementary Fig. S2). The
most conserved sequence between C9ORF72 and other
DENN-like proteins is in two very short motifs that specify
tight beta-turns that are likely to be crucial to the overall struc-
ture (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). One is a Gxe motif at
S1-S2 that is typical of many LDs (Schlenker et al., 2006), and
the other is an Asx motif creating the tight ﬂ-turn at S9-S10
(Chou, 2000), which are conserved in C9ORF72s, but not uni-
versal in the whole DENN family (Supplementary Fig. S6C).

3.4 Relationships between DENN-like proteins

To Visualize the relationships between the entire DENN-like
superfamily, we created a cluster map using a set of diverse
sequences, including fungal and protist. The cluster map
showed three major clusters of sequences (Fig. 2B): (i)
DENNs together with those DENN-like proteins that are iden-
tiﬁed by PSI-BLAST; (ii) FLCN and SMcr8; and (iii)
C9ORF72, FNIP and Lst4p. Looking at group (i) in more
detail, we found that DENND6 is intermediate between other
DENNs and FLCN/SMcr8. For group (ii), the ﬁnding of se-
quences with intermediate properties in the protist Trichomonas
suggests that the FLCN and SMcr8 genes arose by duplication
in an early metazoon or pre—metazoal ancestor. For group (iii),
it is interesting to note that FNIP has a full-length fungal homo-
logue, Lst4p, E-Value=2x 10—7 by HHalign (Supplementary
Table S3 and Fig. S4). Note that Lst4p is not related to
Lst—4, the sorting nexin SNX9 homologue in Caenorhabditis
elegans. These overall groupings conﬁrm the strong homologies
between new DENN-like proteins found with HHpred, and sug-
gest that C9ORF72 is as divergent from FLCN as FLCN is
from DENN.

homologues. (A) Secondary structural conservation between DENN-like
proteins and C9ORF72. Predicted helices (red) and sheets (blue, light
blue: low conﬁdence) are shown in C9ORF72, AVl9p, NPRL2
N-terminus and FNIP C-terminus. Structural elements are numbered in
Avl9p according to homology to DENNDlB (Wu et al., 2011). Solid
arrows join elements aligned by HHpred, and other alignments were
made by hand (dashed arrows). Variations in C9ORF72 are indicated by
numbers above. Large brackets indicate the extent of match between
C9ORF72 and AVL9 (i) initially and (ii) in the reverse search. Insertions
are indicated by the number of residues, except for ‘+’, indicating a loop of
130 aa in human AVL9. (B) Cluster map of the DENN-like superfamily.
306 diverse members of 11 sub-families of DENN-like proteins, excluding
LD only NPRL2/35, were tested for all-versus-all similarity (10 iterations
of PSI-BLAST), and clustered by CLANS (Frickey and Lupas, 2004). All
pairs with similarity threshold P5 10’25 are joined by lines, which are
darker and shorter with greater similarity. Sub-families are identiﬁed by
colour. Outlier organisms (Trichomonas and Entamoeba) are identiﬁed by
shape. Thirty-one colicins included as negative controls showed no links to
the other sequences (data not shown)

its N—terminus, C9ORF72 is most related to LCHN/AVL9.
At its C-terminus, C9ORF72 aligns very well with FNIP,
which shows strong homology to DENN and FLCN.
Independent of HHpred, multiple independent structural predic-
tion engines suggested DENN as a possible homologue of
C9ORF72, despite only two DENN structures being solved to
date. As a benchmark to gauge the strength of the matches we
obtain, they have higher scores than the matches between
DENNs and FLCN. In the future, our prediction can be verified
in ways that have been applied to FLCN: solving the struc-
ture, and showing GEF activity of puriﬁed protein. Our predic-
tions would be helped by including data on the Rab-binding
site. However, the lack of conservation of any potential Rab-
binding residues between DENNDlB and FLCN (Nookala
et al., 2012) suggests that it is unlikely that C9ORF72 shares
these residues.

Because at least one DENN-like protein (Afilp in budding
yeast) binds an Arf GTPase (Tsai et al., 2008), it is not certain

that divergent DENN-like proteins such as C9ORF72 interact
with Rabs. However, a clue for the likely targets of C9ORF72
comes from the large families of C9ORF72 in Trichomonas and
Entamoeba. Both these species have highly expanded families of
Rabs (Lal et al, 2005; Saito-Nakano et al, 2005), while every
other small GTPase family is present in typical numbers (data
not shown). This suggests that C9ORF72 interact with Rabs not
Arfs.

Fine tuning of membrane trafﬁcking by modulation of Rab
activity is already known to be important for neuronal function.
Several DENN domain proteins, as well as Als2/Alsin, a
Rab5-GEF from a different protein family, have been linked
to neurodegeneration because of their effects on membrane traf-
ﬁcking (Azzedine et al, 2003; Del Villar and Miller, 2004;
Hadano et al, 2010). Endosomal and lyosomal function are in-
creasingly recognized as sites of cellular dysfunction in ALS/
FTD because of their role in two specific aspects of membrane
trafﬁc. One is autophagocytosis, which is critical for pathways
that clear large protein aggregates, and which is required for
many aspects of neuronal survival (Harris and Rubinsztein,
2012). Another is endocytic trafﬁcking of the growth factor pro-
granulin (PGRN), uptake of which by some cells might lead to
defective neurotrophic support for key neurons (Carrasquillo
et al, 2010). TDP—43 function is linked to this process via splicing
of sortilin (SORTl), the PGRN uptake receptor (Prudencio
et al, 2012), so a role for C9ORF72 in sortilin-positive endo-
somes should now be considered. Furthermore, Lst4p, the closest
relative of C9ORF72 in yeast, works in the same pathway as
Lst7p, yeast FLCN, to prevent vacuolar (lysosomal) delivery
and re-direct cargo from endosomes back to the trans Golgi
network and plasma membrane. If C9ORF72 shares functions
with Lst4p, human cells with reduced C9ORF72 may well have
excess routing of sortilin/PGRN to lysosomes.

Given the strong homology we have found, we suggest that
C9ORF72 should be renamed DENN-like 72 (DENNL72).
Future studies into DENNL72 should investigate which Rabs
it interacts with, and demonstrate its GEF activity, as well as
focussing on membrane traffic in cells both in patients with the
pathogenic mutation, and in model organisms, including yeast
lacking Lst4p.

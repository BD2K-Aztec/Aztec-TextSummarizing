ABSTRACT

Motivation: The vertebrate retina is a complex neuronal tissue,
and its development, normal functioning and response to injury and
disease is subject to a variety of genetic factors. To understand
better the regulatory and functional relationships between the genes
expressed within the retina, we constructed an interactive gene
network of the mouse retina by applying a Bayesian statistics
approach to information derived from a variety of gene expression,
protein—protein interaction and gene ontology annotation databases.
Results: The network contains 673 retina-related genes. Most of
them are obtained through manual literature-based curation, while
the others are the genes preferentially expressed in the retina.
These retina-related genes are linked by 3403 potential functional
associations in the network. The prediction on the gene functional
association using the Bayesian approach outperforms predictions
using only one source of information. The network includes five major
gene clusters, each enriched in different biological activities. There
are several applications to this network. First, we identified ~50 hub
genes that are predicted to play particularly important roles in the
function of the retina. Some of them are not yet well studied. Second,
we can predict novel gene functions using ‘guilt by association’
method. Third, we also predicted novel retinal disease-associated
genes based on the network analysis.

Availability: To provide easy access to the retinal network, we
constructed an interactive web tool, named MoReNet, which is
available at http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/morenet/

1 INTRODUCTION

In the post-genome era, a major Challenge is to identify the functional
elements in the genomes (Birney et (11., 2007). Both experimental
and computational approaches have been successful in identiﬁcation
of many functional elements (Bertone et (11., 2004; Blanchette et (11 .,
2006; Cawley et (11., 2004; Harrison et (11., 2005; Kim et (11., 2005).
A next step is the determination of the properties of these elements,
especially for the genes that encode proteins. The properties of
a gene include the biological function of its gene product, the

biological pathways in which it acts, and any disease associations.
One traditional method to predict the function of a novel protein
is based on homology, as proteins with similar primary sequences
or 3D structures tend to share biological function (Bateman et (11.,
2004; Whisstock and Lesk, 2003). To understand the biological
pathways in which a protein is involved or to ﬁnd evidence of a
disease association generally requires detailed and time-consuming
laboratory work. Traditional methods to study a gene’s properties
often focus on the protein of interest, and ignore its cellular context.
An emerging technology to predict gene properties takes a different
approach, one based on the analysis of gene networks (D’Haeseleer
et (11., 2000).

Gene co-expression networks have been used to predict protein
function. DNA microarray studies can generate huge amounts of
gene expression data under a variety of different physiological
conditions. Based on the assumption that genes with similar gene
expression proﬁles are likely to be functionally related, researchers
have been successful in applying correlation-based approaches to
predict gene ﬁinction (Eisen et (11., 1998; Lee et (11., 2004a, b;
Niehrs and Pollet, 1999; Zhang et (11., 2004). Similar concepts have
also been applied to predict gene function based on protein—protein
interaction (PPI) networks (Deng et (11., 2004; Jansen et (11., 2003;
Letovsky and Kasif, 2003).

A more informative gene network, and one with hopefully
greater predictive power, could be constructed by integrating diverse
types of biological datasets. For example, probabilistic functional
networks have been developed for a number of organisms, and
these studies have resulted in the identiﬁcation of novel interactions
(Guan et (11., 2008; Kim et (11., 2008; Lee et (11., 2004a, b; Pena-
Castillo et (11., 2008). Network analysis has also been applied to
predict disease-associated genes (Franke et (11., 2006; GOh et (11.,
2007; Ideker and Sharan, 2008; Lage et (11., 2007; Oti et (11., 2006;
Pujana et (11 ., 2007). However, these studies often ignore the speciﬁc
behavior of different cell types (or tissues) and as a result yield
only a ‘uniﬁed network’ that is generic for all tissues. For higher
eukaryotes, we believe that important aspects of gene networks are
intrinsically tissue-speciﬁc. In other words, a ‘uniﬁed network’ will
likely only reﬂect the common, basic cellular processes shared by
all types of tissues or cell types. In order to better understand the
speciﬁc biological systems for higher eukaryotic cells, we need to
construct tissue-speciﬁc gene networks.

In the analysis described here, we used mouse retina as a model
system to construct a tissue-speciﬁc gene network by integrating
different types of available biological data supporting functional
relationships of genes. In the network, genes belonging to the

same group are more likely to join in a common pathway, and are
thus more likely functionally related with each other. This network
can help us decipher the ﬁinction of unknown genes, learn about
new functions for known genes, and also suggest candidate genes
potentially responsible for a variety of retinal diseases.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Microarray data

Nine retina-related microarray datasets, representing retinas under different
conditions, were downloaded from the NCBI GEO database (Supplementary
Table S 1). Also included were a microarray dataset covering 61 mouse tissues
(Su et al., 2004) so as to be able to describe gene expression proﬁles across
tissues, and transcriptome data from laser capture microdissection (LCM)
generated retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), outer nuclear (photoreceptor),
inner nuclear, ganglion cell layer samples derived from adult mouse retina
(L. Hackler et al., manuscript in preparation; NCBI GEO: GSE19304).

All datasets were log2 transformed. Affymetrix probe identiﬁers or cDNA
identiﬁers were converted to ofﬁcial gene symbol name. Genes without
corresponding ofﬁcial gene symbol names were discarded. When multiple
probes correspond to the same gene symbol name, all probes were averaged
to obtain its gene expression level. Since none of the microarray datasets used
in this study was designed for probing exon expression levels, we cannot
differentiate the expression of different transcript variants of the same gene
in a systematic way in this study.

We analyzed each set of microarray data separately instead of merging
them as one dataset, since a pair of genes might be co-expressed in a speciﬁc
experiment condition, but not in all, and the signal in one condition might be
overwhelmed by noise in other conditions when microarray data are merged
(Lee et al., 2004a, b). We also analyzed the correlation between the datasets
to ensure the independence of each dataset.

2.2 PPI data

PPI data was collected from ﬁve databases: DIP (Database of Interacting
Proteins, http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/), MIPS (Mammalian PPI database,
http://mips.gsf.de/proj/ppi/), IntAct (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/
current), Biogrid (http://www.thebiogrid.org/) and HPRD (Human Protein
Reference Database, http://www.hprd.org). 3328 mouse PPI pairs were
obtained. In addition, we also collected 55 048 human PPI pairs. Mouse and
human PPI data are highly correlated; if a protein pair interacts in mouse, it
is highly likely that it also interacts in human. To reduce redundancy, which
would add undue weight in the generation of the network, the overlapped
PPI were deleted from the list of human PPI.

2.3 Known biological pathway and Gene Ontology

Known pathway annotations of 6008 mouse genes were downloaded from
the KEGG database (ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/genes). Gene Ontology
(GO) annotations for 18 184 mouse genes were downloaded from G0.

2.4 Manual curation of retina genes

We performed the literature search for retina-related genes in two steps.
First, we ran our script to search Pubmed by ‘retina + gene name” for all
mouse genes. This provided an initial list for retina-related genes. Second,
we performed a manual check on these genes to see whether the genes are
indeed retina-related with experimental evidence.

2.5 Bayesian integration of data from different sources

According to Bayesian theory,

P(AB)=P(A |B) ><P(B)=P(B|A)><P(A). (1)

Thus,

P (B IA )
P (B)
If A represents the functional relationship of a gene pair, and B2B] ...B,,
represent 11 data supporting functional relationship, such as correlation of

GO annotation, gene expression as well as PPIs, then we can get

P(A|B)= ><P(A). (2)

P(B1...B,,|true)

P(true|B1...B,,)= P(Bl B)
 n

X P (true). (3)
In the equation above, P(true) is the prior probability that the functional
relationship of the gene pair is true, P(B1  B”) is the joint probability
that 11 supporting data occurs, P(B1...B,,|true) is the joint probability that 11
supporting data occurs when the functional relationship is true. The later item
is difﬁcult to compute since we don’t know all true events. To circumvent
this difﬁculty, we consider another equation simultaneously,

P (B1 ...B,, false)

P(false|B1...B,,)= P(Bl B)
 n

X P Qcalse ). (4)

Division of Equation (3) by Equation (4) yields

Equation (7) is easier to use than Equation (3) because L and L(B,») can be
estimated from a small set of known true and false data.

2.6 GO distance score

The average semantic similarity was employed to evaluate the GO distance
of two genes (Lord et al., 2003). According to the deﬁnition, the distance
of two GO terms is decided by their most speciﬁc common parental term.
For example, GO:OOO4317 and GO:OOO4730 has six common parental GO
terms, the most speciﬁc one is GO:0016836, which relates to 38 mouse genes,
thus the semantic distance between GO:0004317 and GO:0004730 equals to
ln(38) =3.64. The more similar two GO terms, the smaller is the semantic
distance score. The distance of two genes is deﬁned as the average distance
score of their related GO terms (Lord et al., 2003).

2.7 Statistical signiﬁcance of cutoff for functional
association

As an approach to establish thresholds with statistical signiﬁcance
probability, we reiteratively randomly selected two gene pairs and exchanged
their score values. We repeated the procedures as many times as the total
number of gene pairs in the data to ensure all gene pairs have been shufﬂed.
In this process, each gene pair is shufﬂed two times on average. Taking the
microarray data containing N genes as an example, we randomly selected
two gene pairs to exchange their Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient (PCC) and
repeated the procedure N X (N — 1) / 2 times. We then computed the combined
L-values for each gene pairs to obtain the distribution of L-values [see
Equation (7) for deﬁnition of L]. The full permutation was repeated 10 times
to create the background. From this background distribution of L—values we
chose a cutoff of Lem = 11, which corresponds to P=0.005. This indicates
that, in random condition only 0.5% of gene pairs have L-value > 11.

2.8 Novel function prediction of gene

We predicted the novel function of individual genes by the GO enrichment
of its neighbors (genes linked to it) in the network. For a given gene, we
took all its neighbors in the network as a gene set, and then computed the
enriched GO term for the gene set using the hypergeometric distribution.

here, N is the total number of mouse genes with G0 annotation and n is
the number of neighbor genes of the given gene, M is the number of mouse
genes annotated with a given GO term and m is the number of neighbor
genes annotated with the GO term.

2.9 Evaluation of disease related gene prediction

The same ‘guilt by association” method was applied to predict novel disease-
associated genes. To systematically evaluate the power of disease-association
genes, we performed a cross-validation analysis. For a group of genes known
to be associated to a retinal disease, we randomly selected three-fourth
of them as training set and predicted whether other genes in the network
(including the remaining known disease genes) are the disease-associated
genes. We sorted the predicted genes according to the P-values, and gave
each gene a rank index. This procedure was repeated 100 times to get the
average ranking for each gene.

2.10 Identiﬁcation of gene clusters by hierarchical
clustering

We ﬁrst constructed a linkage matrix of the gene pairs. If the L-value of

two genes is larger than Lem, the corresponding matrix value is set as Lem,

otherwise it is set as 0. We then performed a hierarchical cluster (average
linkage) on this matrix using CLUSTER software (Reich et al., 2004).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Identiﬁcation of retina-related genes

We ﬁrst compiled the parts list for the retinal gene network, the set
of retina-related genes. The retina-related genes were obtained from
two sources. The ﬁrst was manually curated retina genes supported
by published literature. Our literature search found 512 retina-
related genes, each supported by at least one published paper (see
Supplementary Table S2 for the genes and the related publications).
Second, we also obtained additional retina-related genes based on
the gene expression proﬁles across various tissues. Using the NCBI
UniGene dataset, we obtained genes that are preferentially expressed
in retina using our previously published approach (enrichment score
> 8 and P-value <0.05) (Yu et (11., 2006). By this standard, we
identiﬁed 256 genes preferentially expressed in retina. These two
gene sets were then combined, which resulted in a total of 673
retina-related murine genes.

3.2 Construction of retinal functional network

We attempted to predict functionally related retinal genes by
integrating genomic and proteomic information. To train the
Bayesian model, we ﬁrst created positive and negative datasets
of functionally related gene pairs based on KEGG pathway
information. Functionally related gene pairs were deﬁned as two
genes that share the same pathway annotation. By this deﬁnition, we
obtained 1 755 695 functionally related and 16 289 333 functionally
unrelated gene pairs (genes with KEGG annotation not found in the
same pathway).

The correlations of the datasets are very low, with the maximum of 0.33,
indicating that these datasets are highly independent.

We used three independent data sources to predict functionally
related gene pairs: gene expression, GO and PPIs. For microarray
data, we computed the PCC of expression pattern for each gene pair.
For GO data, we computed the GO similarity score for each gene
pair. For PPI data, we divided them into three categories: interaction,
ortholog interaction and no interaction. We then calculated the
odds ratio (i.e. L) with the observed variable based on positive
and negative data sets. For each gene pair, we ﬁrst computed its
L-value in each data set [L(Bl-)], then obtained its overall L-value by
multiplying these L-values [Equation (7)]. The odds ratio represents
the likelihood that the gene pairs are functionally related given the
observed values.

We selected a conservative Lem of 11, which corresponds to
P-value 0.005 based on permutation simulation (see Section 2), to
deﬁne functionally related gene pairs. Based on an Lem = 11 cutoff,
497 genes are linked by 3403 potential functional relationships.
This conservative cutoff yielded a high speciﬁcity (98.5%) with a
sensitivity of 20.2%, suggesting that the network is of high ﬁdelity,
although it may not reﬂect the whole picture of retinal gene network.

3.3 Performance evaluation of prediction and
independence analysis of datasets

We evaluated the performance of the Bayesian approach using
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The true positive
rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1-speciﬁcity) were
computed for a series of cutoffs. We employed 5-fold cross-
validation: we randomly divided both positive and negative data
sets into ﬁve subsets; one of the subsets is selected as the test set
and the other four subsets are together to form a training set. We then
evaluated the prediction of functional relationship on the training set
using KEGG database as standard. This process was repeated ﬁve
times. As a comparison, we also show the ROC curves of prediction
made from a single type of dataset. The result indicates that the
performance of Bayesian method is better than the prediction based
on any single source information (Fig. 1A).

To use the naive Bayesian method, we must ensure that the
datasets used are independent. Following a previously reported
method, we evaluated the correlation of dataset by PPC of L-values
based on different data sets (Lu et (11., 2005). For each pair of
datasets, we ﬁrst extracted the gene pairs shared by both datasets,
and then computed the correlation coefﬁcient of L-values of these

gene pairs in the two datasets. Our result shows that 83% of PCCs
are <0.15 and the maximum is 0.33, indicating that these datasets
are likely to be independent from each other (Fig. 1B).

3.4 Global organization of the network

After we obtained the murine retinal gene network, we ﬁrst analyzed
the global organization of gene network by examining the major
gene Clusters in the network. Groups of genes that are densely
connected to each other in the network may represent ﬁinctional
modules in which the genes are highly related in ﬁinction and/or
cooperate in some biological processes. We performed hierarchical
Clusters analysis using CLUSTER software (see Section 2), and
found ﬁve major gene Clusters with gene number > 10 (ﬁve red block
in Fig. 2A). The genes in the same Cluster are densely connected with
each other (Fig. 2B), and GO analysis indicates that these ﬁve gene
Clusters are enriched in certain GO annotation terms (Table 1).

Cluster I is enriched in growth factor genes. Growth factors are
molecules that can stimulate the growth and differentiation of cells.
There are 24 genes in this Cluster, 16 are annotated with growth factor
activity (GO:0008083, Bonferroni-corrected P = 4.21E-24). Among
them, Vegfa has been well known to be able to prevent apoptotic
death of retinal endothelial cells and rescues the retinal vasculature
(Alon et (11., 1995). The remaining eight genes are AngptZ, Cartpt,
Fasl, Shh, Slit], S1112, Ttr (1nd Vzp. Since these genes are connected
with 16 growth factor genes in the network, we predict that they
have growth factor activity or their activities cooperate with growth
factors.

Cluster II contains crystallin genes. There are 17 genes in this
Cluster, 16 of them are annotated with structural constituent of eye
lens (GO:0005212, Bonferroni-corrected P=9.85E-45). Although
these genes are previously well known for their role as constituents
of the eye lens, a growing body of evidence shows that these genes
are also expressed in the retina and they may have vital functions
in protecting retinal neurons from damage by environmental and
metabolic stress (Wang et (11 ., 2009; Wu et (11 ., 2009; Xi et (11 ., 2003).

Cluster III contains transcription regulating genes. There are 50
genes in this Cluster, 49 of them are annotated with transcription
regulator activity (GO:0030528, Bonferroni-corrected P: 1.98E-
56), including well-known retinal transcription factors Crx, Nr2e3
and er. The detailed structure of the module can reveal the
cooperative activities among the transcription factors (see later for
details).

Cluster IV is enriched in cation transmembrane transporter genes.
There are 46 genes in this Cluster, 34 of them are annotated
with cation transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0008324,
Bonferroni-corrected P = 1.15E-40). The proteins encoded by these
cation-transport-related genes are important for the transition of
visual signal from photon to electric signal in the retina.

One Cluster (Cluster V) is enriched for visual perception
genes. There are 44 genes in this Cluster, 33 of them are
annotated with both visual perception (GO:0007601, Bonferroni-
corrected P=3.07E-65) and sensory perception of light stimulus
(GO:0050953, Bonferroni-corrected P = 4.78E-65). Even among the
remaining 11 genes that are not annotated as visual perception
genes by the current GO database, some are indeed related to
visual perception. Cp1x4 is an essential regulator of transmitter
release at retinal ribbon synapses, and its knockout leads to aberrant
adjustment of transmitter release at the photoreceptor synapse (Reim

(SCherer et (11., 1996). Grkl is involved in signal transduction
process and in response to light stimulus (Chen et (11., 1999).
S1c24(11 is a potassium-dependent sodium/calcium exchanger in rod
photoreceptors (Sharon et (11., 2002). Aipll, Ankrd33 and Cabp4 are
all photoreceptor proteins, and the mutation inAiplI can cause Leber
congenital amaurosis, a severe early onset retinopathy that leads to
visual impairment in infants (Haeseleer et (11 ., 2004; Liu et (11., 2004;
Sanuki, et (11., 2010; Zeitz et (11., 2006).

These examples show that the gene network can predict novel
biological functions. Furthermore, these ﬁve major groups may
represent the most important and unique aspects of retinal gene
network, which are unlikely to be discovered in a ‘uniﬁed network’.

3.5 Hub genes

In a gene network, the genes with more connections are generally
more important for ﬁtness than those with fewer connection, and the
proteins encoded by these genes often inﬂuence more pathways than
the less connected ones (J eong et (11., 2001). These highly connected
genes are called hub genes. We operationally deﬁned the 10% of
genes with the highest degree of connections as hub genes, where
the degree of a gene is deﬁned as the number of its linked neighbors.
Under this deﬁnition, 50 hub genes were found, with degrees ranging
from 31 to 75 (Table 2). These hub genes and their neighbors cover
327 genes (65.8%) in the network.

The 50 hub genes, as compared to non-hub genes, do in fact
turn out to be more likely to link to more functional modules and
participate in more biological processes. Since we did not use the
number of GO terms as input in our modeling, as an independent
test, we compared the number of GO terms associated with hub
and non-hub genes. The average number of molecular ﬁinction GO

One extreme example is P2rx7, which has 33 related GO ﬁinction

including neural progenitor cell death, reduced bone formation and
brain sickness (Delarasse et (11 ., 2009; Li et (11 ., 2009; Mingam et (11.,
2008).

It has been reported that Crx, er and Nr2e3 play a central
role in the mammalian photoreceptor transcriptional network (Chen
et (11., 1997, 2005; Hsiau et (11., 2007; Mears et (11., 2001; Qian
et (11., 2005). Crx is expressed in both rods and cones and activates
gene expression in both. er and Nr2e3 are rod-speciﬁc and are
required for activation of rod genes and repression of cone genes.
In our network, Crx and Nr2e3 are both hub genes, with degrees
of 42 and 33, respectively. Although er is not a hub gene, its
degree (25) is also high, belonging to the top 20%. Interestingly,
the L-values that represent the strength of association between
genes are high among these three genes (>330), suggesting that
these three factors cooperate tightly in regulating their target
genes. This is consistent with experimental data that indicates that
they can act together synergistically in activating expression of
photoreceptor genes. Furthermore, we found that genes connected
to these three genes also enrich in transcription factors. Sixty four
genes are predicted to be functionally related with these three
genes (Supplementary Fig. S1). Forty of them are annotated with
transcription regulator activity (GO:0030528, Bonferroni-corrected
P = 7.04E-26) and 33 of them are annotated with transcription factor
activity (GO:0003700, Bonferroni-corrected P = 3.70E-24).

One might expect that there would be more studies on hub genes
than on non-hub genes due to their ﬁinctional importance. Since we
did not use information from the literature to obtain the ﬁinctional
association relationships between genes, it is interesting to examine
the correlation between the gene connectivity and Pubmed hits.
We implemented a script to search Pubmed with ‘retina and gene
name’ for each gene in the network. We deﬁned the number of
returned papers as the Pubmed hit number. Larger hit number
indicates more retina-related studies on the gene. Because some
genes may have other aliases, we searched the Pubmed for ofﬁcial
symbol and each alias and then merged the Pubmed IDs into a non-
redundant Pubmed hit set. The median Pubmed hit numbers for
non-hub and hub genes are 9 and 17, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. S2), conﬁrming that more studies were conducted on hub genes
than on non-hub genes (P<0.02, two sample t-test). We found
that some extensively studied hub genes are those with the highest
degrees (>90). Such examples include Crx (degree=42, Pubmed
hit number: 176), Nr2e3 (33, 98), Gnatl (75, 956), Abca4 (54,
164), Pax6 (48, 334),Rcvrn (48, 380), Sag (47, 338), Cman (39,
91),G(1brr1 (37, 163), Gucala (36, 95), Pde6b (34, 122), Shh (33,
95) and Rho (31, 615) (Table 2). This result suggests that researchers
have already captured and studied many important genes in the
network. However, some hub genes have low Pubmed hit numbers
(<5), suggesting they are likely top-candidate genes for further
retina research. Such examples include Accnl, Scnla, Cacnb2,
PpefZ, Ankrd33, Gngtl, Cacna2d3, S1c24(11 , Alp] (13 and Kcnj14.

3.6 Novel function prediction

We are also able to predict gene functions based on network
topology, and this method can complement the more traditional
sequence homology approach. If the neighbors of a gene are enriched
in a certain function, we predict that the gene itself also has that
ﬁinction (see Section 2). The power of such ‘guilt by association’
approach has already been shown in the Cluster and hub gene

analysis. Here we would like to make a systematic prediction of
gene function in the retinal network. For each gene, we Checked
whether its neighbor genes are enriched for certain function and
assigned the enriched ﬁinction to the gene. Using this approach
we predicted that 2875 GO ﬁinction terms are associated with
315 genes (P <0.01, Bonferroni correction, see Section 2). Among
them, 1864 GO terms (64.8%) are known to be associated to the
genes. In addition, 1011 novel functions are predicted for 200 genes
(Supplementary Table S3).

We performed a web search to Check whether some of our
predictions are supported by other evidence. One example is AngptZ
(angiopoietin 2). The protein encoded by this gene is an antagonist
of Angptl , and its deﬁciency can decelerate age-dependent vascular
Changes in the mouse retina (Feng et (11., 2008). Our prediction
suggests this gene have cytokine activity (GO:0005125). As a
support, two recent publications indicate that AngptZ has cytokine
activity and may induce endothelial cell apoptosis (Niedzwiecki
et (11., 2006; Peters, et (11., 2007).

Another example is Drd4. Drd4 (Dopamine receptor 4) is
a G protein-coupled receptor, and its mutation have been
associated with various behavioral phenotypes, including attention
deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. Our prediction
indicates that Drd4 is related to photoreceptor activity. As support, a
recent published paper indicates that Drd4 regulates Adcyl mRNA
level and the cyclic AMP synthesis in photoreceptors, thus inﬂuences
photoreceptor activity (Jackson et (11., 2009).

Here we only showed a few examples to demonstrate
that independent published work supported our gene function
predictions. It is important to note that our results provide many
interesting hypothesis for further experimental validation in the
retinal research community.

3.7 Disease-associated gene

As one more application of this retinal gene network, we can
predict disease-associated genes based on the assumption that a gene
densely connected to known disease-associated genes also tends
to be associated with the same or similar disease. If one gene’s
neighbors are enriched in genes that are known to be associated
with a retinal disease, we predict that the gene is also associated
with the disease. We used the annotation in the database RetNet
(www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/RetNet/) for the deﬁnition of retinal disease
genes.

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary and generally blinding
disease that causes rod photoreceptors in the retina to gradually
degenerate. According to the annotation in RetNet, 22 genes in
the network are known to be RP-related genes (Supplementary
Table S2). To evaluate the prediction power of the network analysis,
we randomly selected 17 genes as training set and predicted whether
other genes in the network (including the remaining ﬁve RP genes)
are RP-associated genes. The genes were ranked by the P-value. This
procedure was repeated 100 times (see Section 2). Each gene was
assigned an average ranking. We then calculated the percentages
of the 22 known RP-associated genes recovered given a ranking
threshold (Fig. 3a). It is Clear that the known disease genes are not
homogenously distributed in the gene list. They tend to be at the
top positions, suggesting that genes involved in the same or similar
diseases are likely to be connected in the retinal gene network. We
not only recovered some known disease genes, we were also able to

predict some novel RP-associated genes (Supplementary Table S2).
Some of the predicted genes are supported by other evidence. For
example, Pdc has been considered as a potential candidate gene
for RP in OMIM database. Gnatl is a transducin gene of visual
impulse that performs the coupling between rhodopsin and CGMP-
phosphodiesterase. Mutation in Gnatl has been reported to lead to
a RP-related diseases, the Nougaret form of congenital stationary
night blindness (Dryja et (11., 1996). Unc119 is a stimulus-response-
related gene. Although it has not been reported to be mutated
in any known form of retinal disease, its inactivation can cause
photoreceptor dysfunction and slow retinal degeneration (Ishiba
et (11., 2007).

We performed the same analysis on cone-rod dystrophy (CRD),
which is an inherited progressive disease that causes degeneration
of cone and rod photoreceptor cells and often results in blindness.
Based on RetNet annotation, 17 genes in the network are known
to be CRD associated genes (Supplementary Table S4). Again, the
known CRD-associated genes are more likely to be on top of the
gene list. In addition, we also predicted some novel CRD-associated
genes. Of them, Ddbl has been reported to be associated with a CRD
related disease, macular dystrophy (Stohr et (11., 1998).

3.8 MoReNet, a web-based interface

A web-based application, Mouse Retinal Network (MoReNet,
http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/morenet/) has been developed that
allows the user to search for gene sets functionally related to a
user-supplied gene list (Fig. 4). Different probability cutoffs can
be selected to deﬁne the ﬁinctional related gene pairs, ranging from
0.1 to 1e — 5. The search result is shown in interactive SVG ﬁgures to
allow the user to zoom in or out and Change parameters, such as node
color, text color, text size, edge color, edge width. Nodes in the ﬁgure
are placed by a Force-directed placement algorithm (Fruchterrnan
and Rheingold, 1991), and can be manually rearranged to get a better
layout.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we integrated a variety of heterogeneous large-
scale genomic datasets to construct a tissue-speciﬁc gene network
that describes interactions between retinal genes in the mouse.
Development of such networks has been made possible by the
recent explosion of available high-throughput biological data, and
the ongoing exponential growth of genome-wide data should make
possible the continuing construction and reﬁnement of such network
models.

Gene network analysis is an emerging approach to study biology.
Previously, prediction of gene function relied heavily on homology
comparison of protein structure or sequence. If a gene of unknown
function does not have high sequence similarity to other genes, it is
difﬁcult to predict its function, and studies of such unknown genes
have often relied upon genetic gain-of—function and loss-of—function
experiments. Prediction based on sequence similarity only utilizes
limited information. Gene network provides a new way to predict
gene function based on the network topology. A similar concept
also applies to disease gene prediction. Network analysis has been
proven to be a powerful method to predict disease genes (Franke
et (11., 2006; Goh et (11., 2007). Another merit of this method is that
it can also predict the importance of genes based on their degrees in
the network, thus experimental biologist can ﬁrst study the vital hub
genes. This can greatly accelerate the complete functional annotation
of the genome.

For mammalian systems, universal gene networks have been
constructed and analyzed. However, we believe that tissue-speciﬁc
(or cell type-speciﬁc) networks are vital to understand tissue
speciﬁcity given the fact that each cell has identical genomic DNA
sequences. For this purpose, we selected a set of retina-related genes
for construction of the network. We believe that any gene expressed
in the retina may play a role in retinal ﬁinction to some extent.
However, considering our aim to construct a retina-speciﬁc gene
functional network, we are interested in the genes that are ‘speciﬁc’
to retina and the relationship between them. Here, we use relative
gene expression level to deﬁne retina-speciﬁc genes in addition to
the known retina-related genes in literatures. If we use absolute
gene expression level as criteria, many of genes in the network will
be the house-keeping genes. The network would be essentially the
same as a ‘universal’ gene network instead of a tissue speciﬁc gene
network. The role of these universal genes is the maintenance of
basic cellular functions, and not the speciﬁc function of the tissue
of interest. Our study provides a careful analysis of the retinal gene
network and facilitates more discoveries for retinal function studies
in this community. To more fully understand a complex biological
system such as the retina, the next step would be the analysis of the

dynamics of the gene network, adding one more dimension (time or
condition) to the system.

Our established computational methods can be readily applied
to other tissues and used to create different tissue-speciﬁc gene
networks. These gene networks will increase our understanding of
ﬁinctional relationships of genes in a tissue-speciﬁc manner. Due
to the striking similarity between the mouse and human genomes,
we expect it to be possible to extrapolate the predicted ﬁinctional
association of genes in mouse retina to that of human retina genes.
Thus, our study can also help to predict genes related to human
retinal diseases, and provide clues and possible targets of treatment.

ABSTRACT

We introduce PEPPER (Protein complex Expansion using Protein—
Protein intERactions), a Cytoscape app designed to identify protein
complexes as densely connected subnetworks from seed lists of pro-
teins derived from proteomic studies. PEPPER identifies connected sub-
graph by using multi-objective optimization involving two functions:
(i) the coverage, a solution must contain as many proteins from the
seed as possible, (ii) the density, the proteins of a solution must be as
connected as possible, using only interactions from a proteome-wide
interaction network. Comparisons based on gold standard yeast and
human datasets showed Pepper’s integrative approach as superior to
standard protein complex discovery methods. The visualization and
interpretation of the results are facilitated by an automated post-
processing pipeline based on topological analysis and data integration
about the predicted complex proteins. PEPPER is a user-friendly tool
that can be used to analyse any list of proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most cellular processes require a large number of proteins to
assemble into functional complexes to perform their activity.
Therefore, describing functional protein complexes taking part
in given processes is critical to the underlying molecular mech-
anism understanding. Experimental protocols such as Afﬁnity
Puriﬁcation followed by Mass-Spectrometry (AP-MS) have
been devised to pull down a protein of interest (bait) together
with all the interacting proteins within the same protein complex
(preys). However, these sets of preys may contain both false posi-
tives, proteins detected despite not actually interacting with the
bait, and omit false negatives (Gingras et al., 2007), proteins
interacting in the cellular context studied but not detected.

repositories can remove some false positives. However, false
negative interacting partners identiﬁcation, thereby the deﬁnition
of the entire protein complex, remains challenging. Proteini
Protein Interaction (PPI) data represents abundant information
that can be used for this purpose.

Protein complexes extraction from PPI networks is a very
active area of research and many methodologies have been
developed to tackle this problem. These computational methods
generally model protein complexes as dense subnetworks within
the complete set of PPIs and thus try to solve a graph clustering
problem or to identify dense regions. Clustering approaches were
shown to be efﬁcient either on large PPI networks or with large-
scale experimental settings in which big numbers of baits result in
context-specific PPI networks (Bader and Hogue, 2003; Nepusz
et al., 2012). However, these algorithms were not developed for
use in small-scale AP—MS experiments (e.g. using only a single
bait protein) and are unable to integrate experimental data with
repositories of PPI.

We reasoned that although not all the protein partners may be
detected in a given AP-MS experiment, these proteins may have
been previously identified as interacting with either the bait or
some of the preys of the experiment. Based on this hypothesis, we
developed PEPPER, which addresses the problem of ﬁnding pro-
tein complexes by combining the experimental results of a single
AP—MS assay with the available information from protein inter-
actions in a global PPI network. PEPPER solves this non-trivial
problem by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (Elati
et al., 2013), which was tested to demonstrate the relevance of
our integrative approach. To do so, we used publicly available
AP—MS datasets for yeast and human species and compared
PEPPER’s results with those of state-of—the-art protein complex
discovery methods. Our ﬁndings highlight the relevance of inte-
grating PPI repositories to the analysis of AP—MS experiments.
We propose PEPPER as a Cytoscape application to further refine
protein complex predictions through functional and topological
analyses.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

In the context of a single AP-MS experiment, PEPPER aims to identify a
dense subnetwork within the PPI network connecting as many of the
proteins identiﬁed in this experiment as possible, referred to hereafter
as the list of seed proteins. PEPPER solves this problem by maximizing
two objective functions: (i) coverage, a solution must contain as many
proteins from the seed protein list as possible; (ii) density, a solution must

Hexagons indicate the expansions proposed by PEPPER and are shown in various shades of red, according to their post-processing score. Dark red
indicates a high predicted relevance to the solution. The edges shown in the graph are exclusively those found in the input PPI network. Green edges are

contain as many interactions as possible. These objectives are often con-
ﬂicting, and thus, no single solution can be considered to dominate over
the others. Instead, the optimal solution is a Pareto optimal set with
multiple solutions. SPEA2 (Zitzler et al., 2001), a popular Multi-
Objective Evolutionary Algorithm, is used for the simultaneous optimiza-
tion of the two objective functions and to identify solutions approximat-
ing the set of pareto-optimal solutions. These solutions are merged into a
ﬁnal predicted protein complex by maximizing the modularity with a
greedy search (see SI algorithm section).

PEPPER was developed as a Cytoscape application, which uses a seed
list of proteins and a large-scale PPI network as inputs (Fig. 1A). In
addition to the aforementioned subnetwork extraction procedure,
PEPPER includes a topological and function-based post-processing pipeline
for ranking the added proteins (expansions) according to their relevance
(Fig. 1B). The predicted complex and each of the proteins are annotated
based on their cellular localization or function annotation speciﬁcity.
Enrichment analysis is complemented by matching the solutions to a
collection of reference protein complexes, and expansions are scored ac-
cording to their co-occurrence with the seeds in these complexes.
Topological scoring is based on the impact of the expansions on the
overall connectivity of the subnetwork (see SI post-processing section).
PEPPER uses these scores to rank expansions and to facilitate results visua-
lization and interpretation (Fig. 1C).

3 CASESTUDY

We assessed the performance of PEPPER and two network cluster-
ing algorithms for protein complex discoveryiMCODE (Bader
and Hogue, 2003) and ClusterONE (Nepusz et al., 2012)—on a
benchmark dataset of 135 yeast and 9 human single-bait AP-MS
experiments and using a set of hand-curated protein complexes as
gold standards. For network clustering methods, performance
was assessed for each AP-MS experiment by selecting the pre-
dicted complex which best matched the seed (details in SI per-
formance comparison section). For each experiment, the reference
complex from the gold standard best matching the seed was used
as the ground truth in a binary classiﬁcation task. Compared with
both of the clustering methods tested, the complexes predicted by
PEPPER scored higher in all of the performance measures for both
organisms (details in SI performance comparison section) with
notably an average increase of 16% of the geometric accuracy
in human and 12% in yeast.

As an example, we describe here the results obtained for the
human WDR92 protein. In the initial list of preys, WDR92 was

identiﬁed as interacting with only one protein. PEPPER expanded
the seed with three new proteins (Fig. 1C) and greatly increased
the overall density of the original solution (22 to 47%). The new
expansion proteins were ordered on the basis of post-processing
score. The ﬁrst two proteins, RUVBLl and RUVBL2, have both
a high topological and Gene Ontology score. The lower scored
protein, MAP3K3, still remains relevant according to its high
topological score (connected to >90% of the predicted complex
proteins). AP-MS experiments using RUVBLl or RUVBL2 as
baits both identiﬁed WDR92 as a prey protein (Choi et al., 2010).
Moreover, in the raw WDR92 experimental data, the set of preys
with lower processing scores (based on peptide counts) than the
threshold contains RUVBLl (see SI Case study section). Thus,
the application of PEPPER to this experiment led to the recovery
of proteins that would not have been identiﬁed otherwise (po-
tential false negatives).

Overall, these results demonstrate the feasibility of expanding
the protein complexes identiﬁed in an AP-MS experiment
through the use of PPI networks and the value of PEPPER for
this purpose.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have
been identified by deep sequencing methods, but their molecular
and cellular functions are known only for a limited number of
lncRNAs. Current databases on lncRNAs are mostly for cataloging
purpose without providing in-depth information required to infer func-
tions. A comprehensive resource on lncRNA function is an immediate
need.

Results: We present a database for functional investigation of
lncRNAs that encompasses annotation, sequence analysis, gene ex-
pression, protein binding and phylogenetic conservation. We have
compiled lncRNAs for six species (human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly,
worm and yeast) from ENSEMBL, HGNC, MGI and lncRNAdb.
Each lncRNA was analyzed for coding potential and phylogenetic con-
servation in different lineages. Gene expression data of 208 RNA-Seq
studies (4995 samples), collected from GEO, ENCODE, modENCODE
and TCGA databases, were used to provide expression profiles in
various tissues, diseases and developmental stages. Importantly, we
analyzed RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed mRNAs that would
provide ample insights on lncRNA functions. The resulting gene list
can be subject to enrichment analysis such as Gene Ontology or
KEGG pathways. Furthermore, we compiled protein—lncRNA inter-
actions by collecting and analyzing publicly available CLIP-seq or
PAR-CLIP sequencing data. Finally, we explored evolutionarily con-
served lncRNAs with correlated expression between human and six
other organisms to identify functional lncRNAs. The whole contents
are provided in a user-friendly web interface.

1 INTRODUCTION

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noniprotein-coding
transcripts >200 nt. Many lncRNAs have been reported to
play important molecular and cellular functions despite of not

producing protein products. They typically recruit proteins to
help or disturb formation of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) com-
plexes. Depending on the role of interacting proteins, lncRNAs
play central roles in a wide range of cellular processes. An
illustrative example is RMST, a brain-speciﬁc lncRNA, which
physically interacts with SOX2 and plays a key role in transcrip-
tional regulation of neurogenic transcription factors (Ng et al.,
2013).

Several lncRNAs were implicated in various types of cancers
(Maruyama and Suzuki, 2012). MALATl was reported to be a
critical regulator of the metastasis phenotype of lung cancer cells
(Gutschner et al., 2013), and CCAT2 was shown to promote
tumor growth, metastasis and chromosomal instability in
WNT-dependent fashion in colon cancer (Ling et al., 2013). In
fact, lncRNAs are expected to be involved in every stage of hall-
marks of cancer (Gutschner and Diederichs, 2012), thereby ser-
ving as critical regulators and therapeutic targets in many cases.

Owing to the development of high-throughput sequencing
technologies, thousands of lncRNAs have been recently dis-
covered from RNA-Seq data. However, the biological and mo-
lecular characteristics of the large majority of lncRNAs remain
unknown. Databases or tools that facilitate functional investiga-
tion of lncRNAs would be of great value to identify important
lncRNAs based on understanding of biological roles.

Several databases on lncRNAs have already been developed
for various purposes. LNCipedia (V olders et al., 2013),
lncRNAdb (Amaral et al., 2011) and lncRNome (Bhartiya
et al., 2013) are mostly for annotation databases based on litera-
ture evidence. NRED (Dinger et al., 2009) and NONCODE V3.0
(Bu et al., 2012) provide microarray expression proﬁles in vari-
ous tissues for human and mouse. Some of these databases con-
tain additional useful information on function such as the RNA
secondary structure, microRNA binding and protein-lncRNA
interactions (Bhartiya et al., 2013; Volders et al., 2013), but
they are mostly limited for human. Furthermore, RNA-Seq
data, the most useful source of lncRNA properties, have never
been systematically collected and mined for functional investiga-
tion yet. Thus, we still lack a comprehensive resource to cover
sequence characteristics and function-related data organized in a
systematic way.

Here, we introduce lncRNAtor to perform in-depth functional
analysis of lncRNAs by combining sequence characteristics, gene
expression data and proteinilncRNA interactions. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to compile massive RNA-
Seq data with the support of downstream analysis such as

IncRNAtor for functional investigation of long non-coding RNAs

 

coexpression and gene set enrichment, covering six important
model organisms.

2 DATA AND METHODS

o lncRNA compendium: lncRNAs of length >200bp in
ENSEMBL (version 70), HGNC, MGI and lncRNAdb
were collected for six model organisms (human, mouse, zeb-
raﬁsh, fruit fly, worm and yeast). Statistics of compiled
lncRNAs are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

0 Sequence analysis and phylogenetic conservation: Each
lncRNA was analyzed for protein-coding potential with
CPC, an SVM-based classiﬁer using sequence features
(Kong et al., 2007). We also calculated the evolutionary
conservation score using the phastCons track (multiz align-
ments of 46 vertebrates) from UCSC genome database
(Pollard et al., 2010). We used the reduced representaion
of genes by collaping all splice variants into a hypothetical
gene. Lineage-speciﬁc scores were obtained by analyzing
multiple alignment of organisms in speciﬁc lineages such
as primates, mammals and vertebrates. Genomic regions
overlapping with protein-coding genes were eliminated in
calculating average conservation score to avoid the mislead-
ing hyper-conservation.

o RNA-Seq data: We have collected RNA-Seq data in GEO,
ENCODE, modENCODE and TCGA databases. Each
dataset was manually curated and classiﬁed into tissue
types, cancer types, drugs and developmental stages accord-
ing to the experimental design. In total, we have compiled
208 datasets of 4995 samples. Raw RNA-Seq data were
subject to in—house pipeline of mapping by TopHat 2.0.8
(Kim et al., 2013) and quantification by Cufﬂinks 2.1.0
(Trapnell et al., 2010). Multi-hits was set to 20 as the default
option. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identi-
fied by Cuffdiff2 (Trapnell et al., 2013). TCGA datasets
were downloaded at level 3 of read counts and expression
proﬁles obtained from RSEM quantiﬁcation (Li and
Dewey, 2011), and reannotated from hg18 to ENSEMBL
GRCh37. DEG test was performed by DESeq 2 1.0.19
(Anders et al., 2013).

o Protein—lncRNA binding data: Deep sequencing data of
CLIP-Seq, RIP-Seq and PAR-CLIP were amassed from
GEO and modENCODE. It included 319 samples covering
96 RNA-binding proteins. RIPSeeker was used to identify
the associated transcripts and binding sites (Li et al., 2013).
We have adjusted the binding P-Value taking the number of
binding regions into consideration.

0 Coexpression and gene set analysis: Coexpression of genes
and lncRNAs was calculated for RNA-Seq datasets with
the number of samples >10. The most abundant transcript
was selected to be the representative of gene expression, thus
ignoring the isoform difference. All pairwise correlations
were pre-calculated using the Spearman’s rank correlation
to reduce the inﬂuence of outlier genes, and top 1000 cor-
relations were stored for each coding or lncRNA gene for
speed and efﬁciency in web implementation. Gene set

analysis of overrepresentation were supported for Gene
Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways. We used the
upper-tail hypergeometric test with the P-Value cutoff of
0.01 and the multiple test corrections (Bonferroni and
BenjaminiiHochberg methods) using all genes with G0 or
KEGG annotation as the background distribution. Gene
sets of size 55 or hits 52 were filtered out from the overrep-
resented terms.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Database overview

The scope of database, category of analyses and characteristics
of data are brieﬂy summarized in the schematic overview of
lncRNAtor in Figure 1.

anRNAtor is based on three main types of datavannotation
and conservation, gene expression from RNA-Seq and protein-
lncRNA interactions. It includes 21 575 lncRNAs from six model
organisms of human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit ﬂy, worm and yeast.
Our compendium dataset includes 14051 human, 4030 mouse,
1666 zebrafish, 501 fruit ﬂy, 1312 worm and 15 yeast lncRNA
genes. Importantly, lncRNAtor features the most extensive
compilation of RNA-Seq data, covering 208 datasets of 4995
samples, and proteinilncRNA interactions for 96 proteins of
319 samples.

These data were organized into several modules of analyzing
(i) sequence features such as protein-coding potential and cross-
species conservation, (ii) expression profiles and differential ex-
pression based on RNA-Seq data, (iii) proteinilncRNA binding
obtained from deep sequencing data and (iv) functional inference
of GO and KEGG pathways based on coexpressed protein-
coding genes.

3.2 Basic features

The Web site is composed of the basic search and several
advanced analyses of coexpression, differential expression and
binding proteins. Figure 2a shows the output screenshot from
the basic search, which includes the brief summary of each
lncRNA with linkouts to other databases. The non-coding
nature of lncRNAs can be confirmed by examining the pro-
tein-coding potentials, ORF prediction and the blast hits pro-
vided by the CPC program (Kong et al., 2007).

Next, we show the conservation score obtained from the mul-
tiple alignment data of phastCons track in the UCSC genome
database. Lineage-specific scores were calculated for promoter
(7500 bp), 5/-end of transcript (100 bp), exon, intron and 3/-end
of transcript (100bp) regions on various lineages including
primate, mammal and vertebrate. We also provide a link to
the UCSC genome browser, showing phylogenetic conservation
at base-pair resolution.

Gene expression proﬁles are provided in a separate tab menu
for representative tissues, cancers and developmental stages
according to the characteristics of RNA-Seq data. We show the
normalized expression value (FPKM) in box plots as shown in
Figure 2b. For user convenience, we provide additional tab menus
of differential expression and binding proteins for lncRNA of
interest, with details explained in the following section.

We have examined the gene expression levels in nine RNA-Seq
datasets from TCGA, GEO and ENCODE databases including
352 samples from human, mouse, worm, fruit ﬂy and zebraﬁsh
(Supplementary Table S2). The distribution curves in
Supplementary Figure S1 show that the cutoff value of
FPKM = 1.0 seemed a reasonable choice to differentiate tran-
scripts within noise level for all datasets. Transcripts of average

FPKM <1.0 were removed from further analyses of differential
expression and coexpression. We have also compared the expres-
sion of protein-coding genes and lncRNAs in each dataset. The
distribution curves of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes were
shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The proportion of expressed
(i.e. FPKM>1.0) lncRNAs was<10°/o of total transcripts in
most datasets, much smaller values compared with that of

protein-coding genes (Supplementary Table S3). This is consist-
ent with the previous result that reported tissue-speciﬁc expres-
sion pattern for lncRNAs (Derrien et al., 2012).

3.3 Differential expression and binding proteins

Differential expression of lncRNAs is valuable information to
identify lncRNAs of functional roles in speciﬁc contexts. In an
effort to provide a comprehensive summary of RNA-Seq data-
sets, we devised a dataset browser of tree structure, classifying
RNA-Seq datasets into distinct groups of organism, cancer,
drug, tissue and developmental stage. Figure 3a shows the ex-
ample of 133 datasets in the TCGA category (the kidney part).

All RNA-Seq datasets were pre-processed for differential ex-
pression of lncRNAs. For each dataset, we manually classiﬁed
samples into the different groups and performed the statistical
test to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs
(see Section 2 for details).

Selecting the dataset and comparison of interest in the browser
tree (‘Kidney chromophobe: Normal versus Tumor’ in this ex-
ample) shows the expression heatmap of differentially expressed
lncRNAs (and mRNAs if needed) as shown in Figure 3b. The list
can be sorted, searched and exported into a separate file for
further analysis. Abundant datasets of TCGA and GEO allow
users to explore differential expression of lncRNAs in diverse
contexts such as tumor stages and drug treatment. Model organ-
ism data provide valuable information on lncRNAs of develop-
mental roles.

Proteins binding to lncRNAs are valuable source of informa-
tion on lncRNA function. We obtained 35 867 lncRNAeprotein
bindings (adj. P<0.01) by analyzing the IP—based deep sequen-
cing data of 96 RNA-binding proteins and 319 samples. These

RNA-binding proteins were classiﬁed into different functional
groups of transcription (hnRNPs, CPSFs), binding (ELAVl,
RBM4), microRNA (AGO, LIN28), epigenetic regulation
(Ezh2, Polycomb complex) and so on. Although the current
dataset is rather small, many proteins of importance in RNA
processing and regulation are already covered to provide
lncRNA candidates involved in these processes. Statistics of
lncRNAeprotein binding is available in online documentation.
Selecting a speciﬁc RNA-binding protein shows the binding
heatmap of lncRNAs (and mRNAs) in a similar manner to the
expression heatmap.

3.4 Coexpression and functional gene set analysis

Guilt-by-association is the principal method of predicting func-
tions of genes with unknown function. Thus, protein-coding
mRNAs that are coexpressed with lncRNA of interest often pro-
vide ample insights into molecular functions (Liao et al., 2011).
Because RNA-Seq data provide the gene expression proﬁle of
coding as well as non-coding RNAs in an unbiased manner, it is
an ideal source data to explore coexpression between coding
mRNAs and lncRNAs. A systematic study on correlated expres-
sion of lncRNAs was carried out by the GENCODE consortium
(Derrien et al., 2012).

We developed a module to explore the coexpressed protein-
coding mRNAs in a context-speciﬁc manner. Supported datasets
include RNA-Seq data in the TCGA, GEO and ENCODE data-
bases. Human datasets are mostly for cancer from TCGA and
GEO. Mouse (GSE36025 of CSHL, GSE36026 of LICR) and
zebrafish (GSE30608, ERP000016 from Sanger) datasets from
ENCODE cover various tissues. Worm and fruit ﬂy datasets
from modENCODE cover developmental stages.

Selecting a dataset and lncRNA displays the expression heat-
map of lncRNA and mRNAs of correlated expression as shown
in Figure 4a. Here, we show the coexpression of lncRNA
NEATl using the dataset of ‘Kidney chromophobe: Normal
versus Tumor’ from TCGA. The search can be performed for
genes as well to identify lncRNAs of correlated expression. The
list can be exported for further analysis.

In an effort to support functional interpretation of coex-
pressed genes, we implemented the gene set overrepresentation
analysis for GO terms and KEGG pathways. Coexpressed genes
whose correlation coefﬁcients are above or below the cutoff
value can be automatically subject to statistical enrichment test
in specific GO terms or KEGG pathways. Figure 4b shows the
sample output from the gene set analysis using top 200 protein-
coding genes coexpressed with NEAT1. The result indicates that
the complement activation and Rho signal transduction path-
ways are signiﬁcant processes. The role of NEATl for the
kidney tumor development in the context of associated pathways
warrants further experimental works.

It is often the case that coexpressed genes are not necessarily
connected to homogeneous molecular functions or processes,
yielding presumably false terms in gene set overrepresentation
analysis. We implemented a filtering scheme to discard the
isolated genes using the proteineprotein interactions (PPIs) in
the REACTOME (version 47) database that included 1.827 mil-
lion PPIs for human. Users may activate this PPI ﬁltering pro-
cedure before applying the enrichment analysis of functional

3.5 Conserved lncRNAs with correlated expression

Cross-species conservation and correlated expression pattern are
strong evidences for functional lncRNAs. To suggest the candi-
dates of functional lncRNAs, we searched for lncRNAs that
were conserved between human and orthologous genomes and
whose expression patterns were highly correlated in orthologs.
These lncRNAs are evolutionarily conserved in terms of se-
quences as well as expression patterns, thus being expected to
play important biological roles.

Cabili et al. reported identiﬁcation of orthologous lncRNAs
by assembling and comparing transcript sequences from RNA-
Seq (Cabili et al., 2011). In general, lncRNAs are known to
be less conserved than protein-coding genes. We have
investigated the sequence conservation across species using
the UCSC phastCons track (Supplementary Fig. S3). For pro-
tein-coding genes, exons and 5/-UTR regions were better con-
served than lncRNAs in both human and mouse. However,
the sequence conservation of upstream (—500 bp of transcrip-
tion start site) and intronic regions was comparable with the
exonic region in lncRNAs. Thus, we used the genomewide
multiple alignment of the UCSC phastCons track to identify
orthologous lncRNAs instead of comparing transcriptome

sequences. Orthologous relations with many-to-many or anti-
sense—sense correspondence were discarded. We obtained 628
non-human lncRNAs corresponding to 507 human lncRNAs.

Next, we searched for correlated expression pattern between
orthologous lncRNAs. RNA-Seq data (GSE30352) for the
polyadenylated RNA fraction of six organs from 10 species
were used to estimate the expression correlation (Brawand
et al., 2011). To remove biases from tissue-speciﬁc lncRNAs,
we ﬁltered out lncRNAs that were expressed in one or two
tissues only. Using the cutoff of Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
>0.5, we have identiﬁed 72 conserved lncRNAs with corre-
lated expression between human and orthologous non-human
species, including 50 human—mouse cases. Among lncRNAs
expressed in one or two tissues, we have identiﬁed 27 con-
served lncRNAs additionally.

We applied the same strategy to independent expression data-
sets of multiple tissues in human and mouse. Using the Illumina
human BodyMap 2.0 dataset that proﬁled 16 normal tissues
(E-MTAB-513 in ArrayExpress) and the mouse ENCODE tran-
scriptome data from CSHL and LICR (GSE36025, GSE36026)
(Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2012), we calculated the expresssion
correlation in 11 common tissues. From these datasets, we
found 26 conserved lncRNAs with correlation coefﬁcient of ex-
pression >0.5.

Investigating lncRNAdb that collected literature-based infor-
mation yielded only 28 conserved lncRNAs between human and
mouse. Results from two independent datasets yielded 13
common members, only two of which were included in the anno-
tated database of lncRNAdb (Fig. 5). These lncRNAs would
serve as highly reliable candidates of functional lncRNAs,
which warrant further investigation.

The ‘Cons+Corr lncRNAs’ menu in the web site shows our
list of conserved lncRNAs with correlated expression. The scat-
terplot of expression correlation is available for detailed analysis.

IncRNAtor for functional investigation of long non-coding RNAs

 

4 CONCLUﬁON

Even if thousands of lncRNAs have been identiﬁed so far, their
functional roles are known only for a limited number of
lncRNAs. Thus, we need an efﬁcient tool for inferring molecular
expression and functions of lncRNAs to serve increasing number
of scientists interested in this important class of non-coding
RNAs.

Recently, three other groups released update databases on
lncRNAs. NONCODEV4 0(ie et al., 2014) provides the gene
expression pattern from RNA-Seq data. NPInter V2.0 Ofuan
et al., 2014) and starBase V2.0 (Li et al., 2014) are databases of
proteineRNA interactions based on CLIP-Seq data. Those high-
throughput gene expression and proteineRNA interaction data
were integrated together in the lncRNAtor database, enabling
users to investigate diverse properties related to molecular func-
tions. With the support of diverse features such as coexpression,
differential expression and binding proteins, lncRNAtor would
become a valuable resource on the role of lncRNAs to diverse
groups of bench biologists. The coverage and predictive power of
lncRNAtor are expected to increase as the regular update of the
deep sequencing data in public. We plan to update the database
on annual basis.

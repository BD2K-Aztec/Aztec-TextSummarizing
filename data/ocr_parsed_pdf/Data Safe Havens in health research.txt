Abstract

Motivation: The data that put the 'evidence’ into 'evidence—based medicine’ are central to developments in
public health, primary and hospital care. A fundamental challenge is to site such data in repositories that
can easily be accessed under appropriate technical and governance controls which are effectively audited
and are viewed as trustworthy by diverse stakeholders. This demands socio—technical solutions that may
easily become enmeshed in protracted debate and controversy as they encounter the norms, values, ex—
pectations and concerns of diverse stakeholders. In this context, the development of what are called 'Data
Safe Havens’ has been crucial. Unfortunately, the origins and evolution of the term have led to a range of
different definitions being assumed by different groups. There is, however, an intuitively meaningful inter—
pretation that is often assumed by those who have not previously encountered the term: a repository in
which useful but potentially sensitive data may be kept securely under governance and informatics systems
that are fit—for—purpose and appropriately tailored to the nature of the data being maintained, and may be
accessed and utilized by legitimate users undertaking work and research contributing to biomedicine, health
and/or to ongoing development of healthcare systems.

Results: This review explores a fundamental question: ’what are the specific criteria that ought reasonably
to be met by a data repository if it is to be seen as consistent with this interpretation and viewed as worthy
of being accorded the status of ’Data Safe Haven’ by key stakeholders’? We propose 12 such criteria.

1 Introduction
1.1 Data in society
We live in a data—rich and increasingly information—driven world, and
society is rapidly responding to the opportunities and challenges this
presents (Davies et (11., 2002; Shaw, 2014). This is as true in biomedi—
cine as in any other domain of human endeavour (Lohr, 2012; OECD
Expert Group for International Collaboration on Microdata Access,
2014). Public expectations of health services have never been higher,
with greater emphasis on ensuring accountability, effectiveness, effi—
ciency, quality and safety of health services (Wyke, 2009). But, these
expectations can never be met in full because demands on health ser—
vices typically exceed the resources that societies make available
(Calabresi and Bobbitt, 1978). The management of health and dis—
ease, policy and decision making and the development of healthcare
systems in this resource—limited environment demand underpinning by
evidence—based investigation and evaluation that is as rigorous as is
currently possible. The data that put the ‘evidence’ in ‘evidence—based
medicine’ are therefore central to developments in public health, pri—
mary and hospital care, for both generic and personalized/stratified
medicine (Academy of Medical Sciences, 2013; Shaw, 2014).
Relevant data may be collected as part of usual healthcare, from
other routine administrative sources or primarily for research pur—
poses projects (Academy of Medical Sciences, 2014). These data
may be used to guide decisions and management in healthcare or
to drive research to inform future decisions and planning. The
generation and use of these data are embedded in complex, and
ever—changing, social settings, structures and networks: from indi—
vidual researchers or research groups to international research
consortia and from individual healthcare practitioners or institu—
tions to whole—of—country health systems. The management and
utilization of healthcare and health research data comprise socio—
technical solutions (Geels, 2005) that may easily become
enmeshed in controversy as they encounter the norms, values,
expectations and fears of diverse stakeholders. While some com—
mentators (e.g. data generators, many healthcare professionals,
research users, funders, industry, and many in government) may
argue the benefits of appropriately analysed and interpreted data,
others may express some degree of ambivalence or outright concern
regarding the collection and use of personal data to inform evi—
dence—based healthcare. Thus, worries about risks to individual priv—
acy and confidentiality are played out against potential population
benefits. This tension, often described in terms of the balance of in—
dividual rights and public good, is well evidenced in recent contro—
versies in the UK following the attempted introduction by the NHS
(National Health Service) of a nationwide mechanism, branded as
‘care.data’, for making routinely collected individual—level health
data available for research (Taylor, 2014). The care.data scheme
was postponed following a media furore that characterized the pro—
posal as, at one extreme, the ‘big brother data plan’ (Adams, 2013)
and, at the other, ‘a basic human right’ (Kelsey, 2013).
Notwithstanding the hyperbole of media constructions, this so—
called ‘crisis’ is consistent with the rise of an increasingly data—savvy
general public that is wary of expert claims to appropriately care for
their personal information.

The ‘individual rights/public good’ dichotomy is based on a
Western—centric view of individual autonomy that is pervasive but not
ubiquitous, and not necessarily useful for purposes of appropriately
managing human health and research data. Autonomy is understood
as the right (and capacity) of an individual to decide for themselves,
but that right, the right to choose, is conditional on broader consider—
ation of the impact of those decisions on others (Beauchamp and
Childress, 1979). In most Western conceptualizations it is the former
condition that is emphasized in combination with the principle of
non-maleficence (Beauchamp and Childress, 1979) which places great
moment on ensuring that no individual is unknowingly placed at risk
of harm from research or healthcare—regardless how low that risk ac—
tually may be nor how minor the potential harm. A narrow view of
autonomy, however, ultimately constrains patient and public deci—
sions in healthcare (Murtagh and Hepworth, 2003). Furthermore, if it
is accorded undue weight by ethical committees it can sometimes in—
hibit valuable scientific work. This may happen, for example, if ethics
committees insist on obtaining formal consent when it is difficult to
obtain in practice or counterproductive from a scientific perspective
(Hansson, 2010), and/or in any setting where the public and patients
understand the reasons for, and are supportive of, ‘research without
consent’ because it brings direct public benefit (Lecouturier et (11.,
2008). Under such circumstances, adoption of a broader definition of
autonomy—which includes the right to contribute to society if one so
chooses—might significantly facilitate important health related, par—
ticularly data—driven, research (Hansson, 2010). Going further — be—
yond the consideration of rights—a handful of commentators have
argued that individuals who benefit from the provision of sophisti—
cated healthcare have a responsibility to allow their personal data to
be used to help the development of that system (Doll and Peto, 2001).

Wherever you stand in debates about freedom of the individual,
the fact remains that, as researchers and policy makers in health, we
have an ethical and legal duty to ensure that data are managed and
used as effectively as possible. But we should not be disingenuous in
this stance; along with the ethico—social imperatives there are clear
pragmatic benefits to ‘taking responsibility’, not least in facilitating
our own research practice. Being responsive to the evolving societal
context—engaging the range of governance and other mechanisms
by which to do this—is fundamental to maintaining the relationship
of trust that is required to ensure public and research participants
have sufficient confidence to provide the data upon which research
and healthcare development depend. Appropriate and proportionate
governance and stewardship of the processes of data for health re—
search require a systemic approach which includes but goes beyond
narrowly defined formal mechanisms of responsibility (Owen et (11.,
2013). Such an approach, focusing on the establishment and mainte—
nance of trustworthiness, would necessarily be aligned with broad
societal norms and values, embody the collective responsibility of
science and society, and would be responsive and dynamic.

1.2 What’s in a name? The creation of ’Data Safe
Havens’

Given the need to ensure that health—related data are used efficiently,
effectively and in a manner that is socially aware, a fundamental

challenge is to site them in repositories that can easily be accessed by
those with the need and permission to do so. However, they must be
under appropriate technical and governance controls to ensure se—
curity and these must be properly evaluated and audited. In this con—
text, the development of what are called ‘Data Safe Havens’ has
become increasingly popular (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2015).
The first formal use of this title in relation to the management of
health data appears to have been by the British National Health
Service (NHS) in the early 19905: ‘safe haven’ being used to cover
both a defined physical location and an administrative set of policies
and procedures relating to the secure handling of confidential pa—
tient information (Directorate of Information Services
MEL(1992)42, 1992). Since then the term has evolved in at least
three different directions (Administrative Data Taskforce, 2012;
Caldicott, 2013; NHS Research Capability Programme, 2008): (i) a
specific term to reﬂect a changing series of different data manage—
ment constructs primarily related to the NHS and with a particular
focus on record linkage—e.g. ‘a protected space under the control of
an independent clinician’ (Anderson, 1996); secure environments,
limited to small numbers of users, in which data are managed, qual—
ity is assessed and linkage between records can take place (NHS
Research Capability Programme, 2008); and a means ‘to ensure the
safety and secure handling of confidential patient identifiable infor—
mation’ (NHS Connecting for Health, 2009); (ii) a more generic
term, subsuming for example the Data Safe Haven at University
College London, that implies ‘a designated physical or electronic
area that provides the most appropriate level of security for the use
of the most sensitive and confidential information’ (Care Record
Development Board, 2007), or ‘an environment for population—
based research and statistical analysis in which the risk of identifying
individuals is minimized’ (Thomas et al., 2008) or a ‘physical envir—
onment where access to disclosive data can be controlled’
(Administrative Data Taskforce, 2012); and (iii) specialist secure set-
tings in which data can be analysed—either locally, or remotely via
secure privacy protecting mechanisms, but cannot physically be
removed from that setting (Lyons, 2009 #5082; Administrative
Data Taskforce, 2012 #5799; Academy of Medical Sciences, 2014
#5787; Jones, 2014 #5821) NHS—Scotland National Safe Haven
(http://www.adls.ac.uk/nhs—scotland/nhs—scotland—national—safe—
haven/). In this third category, it should be noted that the OECD
microdata report uses the terms ‘data enclave’ or ‘safe centre’ for the
specific case of ‘a facility equipped with computers not linked to the
internet or an external network and from which no information can
be downloaded via USB ports, CD—DVD or other drives’ (OECD
Expert Group for International Collaboration on Microdata Access,
2014).

Unfortunately, for the reasons outlined above there is now ser—
ious uncertainty about appropriate usage of the term ‘Data Safe
Haven’. Furthermore, although the various meanings have evolved
primarily within the UK, it is increasingly being used internation—
ally (Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, 2014). This adds
an additional potential for confusion with the ‘Safe Harbour
Principles’ that relate to cross—border data transfer rules under EU
Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data.
Recognizing the potential for serious confusion, the UK Academy
of Medical Sciences recently ran an international workshop on
Data Safe Havens (Academy of Medical Sciences, 2014). It was
concluded that, from a generic perspective, they are provided to
‘enable. .. [data] access and linkage’ whilst ‘upholding the duty of
confidentiality and protecting the data subject’s right to privacy’
(Academy of Medical Sciences, 2014). But at the same time, it was
noted that ‘agreeing on a single definition of ‘data safe haven’ will

be difficult as there is a wide variety of systems in operation’.
Moreover, there is, for example, ‘no consistency on whether the
safe haven: holds identified or de—identified data; provides access
to data on site or remotely; processes data and sends them exter—
nally; and provides training and support for data users’ (Academy
of Medical Sciences, 2014). This lack of consensus about the de—
tailed implications of a term that is of such potential value may in
part explain why the phrase ‘safe haven’ is completely absent from
the comprehensive recent OECD review of international access to
microdata (OECD Expert Group for International Collaboration
on Microdata Access, 2014). The Global Alliance for Genomics
and Health has therefore adopted Data Safe Havens as a specific
focus for its Regulatory and Ethics Working Group and this cur—
rent paper reﬂects some of the key thinking arising from that deci—
sion, particularly through its foundational Framework for
Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data (Global
Alliance for Genomics and Health, 2014).

From a pragmatic perspective, the definitional ambiguity we
have highlighted may be viewed as less than ideal but not fatal. Yet
that would be to underestimate the impact that use—or non—use—of
specific language can have on society’s perspective of challenging
concepts and agencies. In this regard, few would argue against soci—
ety developing safe havens for data in a sense that would be mean—
ingful and valid both to professionals and to the general public: i.e.
repositories in which useful but potentially sensitive data could be
kept securely allowing them to be used by legitimate professionals
undertaking work and research contributing to biomedicine, health
and to ongoing development of the healthcare system. From this per—
spective, which is based on an intuitive interpretation, the term
‘Data Safe Haven’ is therefore an appellation that could be used to
very good purpose but must be wielded with caution. If entities
called ‘Data Safe Havens’ were to turn out to have characteristics
that worried a substantial number of individuals or society as a
whole or if they were to fail to come up to the standards implied by
their name, the very term could start to take on negative connota—
tions. The ease with which this may occur is clearly demonstrated
by the care.data example, given earlier.

Unfortunately, the current definitional ambiguity, coupled with
the fact that some users of the term do believe it to have a single spe—
cific meaning, has meant that two professionals discussing Data
Safe Havens can completely misunderstand one another and yet to
have no reason to suspect that a misunderstanding has arisen.
Arguably, therefore, the undeniable importance of the underlying
concept and the potential value of the term itself, imply that this un—
certainty demands urgent resolution. This paper attempts to do this.
However, we approach the problem from a rather different stand—
point than other recent attempts to clarify the definition (Academy
of Medical Sciences, 2014). To be specific, we start from the pos—
ition that there is no universally accepted definition of the term—
even if it may have been clearly defined at the outset (Directorate of
Information Services MEL(1992)42, 1992) and may have a particu—
lar legal interpretation in certain jurisdictions (Caldicott, 2013). In
consequence, there is little point in trying to identify a ‘correct’ def—
inition which may be contrasted with other ‘incorrect’ definitions.
Instead, this paper addresses the more basic, and in our view more
important, question: what are the specific challenges that ought rea-
sonahly to he met by a data repository in order that the researchers
managing and using it, the individuals who originally provided their
data and other key stakeholders might reasonably he expected to
agree that the repository is ‘trustworthy’ in that it is managed and
used in a manner that maintains acceptable data integrity and en-
sures their appropriate security?

Fig. 1. The data pipeline

In identifying these challenges we consider whether there is a
particular constellation of criteria that might be viewed as defining
an entity that could reasonably be called a ‘Data Safe Haven’.
However, to begin, we describe the phenomenon that we understand
to provide the contextual underpinning for discussion of Data Safe
Havens: the data pipeline.

2 The data pipeline in contemporary health
science

The term ‘data pipeline’ is used widely; in the computing
setting it typically refers to ‘a chain of data-processing stages...’
(e.g. (Dilger et al., 2013). Here, we use it—with this same basic
interpretation—to refer to a simplified conceptual representation of
the life—course of individual—level data in a biomedical data reposi—
tory (a location for the secure storage of biomedical research and/or
healthcare—related data) from the moment of collection or gener—
ation, through their utilization and conversion into useful know—
ledge, and ultimately their archiving or destruction. At its simplest,
this data pipeline may be viewed as comprising two primary compo—
nents that are temporally and sometimes spatially distinct: acquisi—
tion and exploitation (Fig. 1). Acquisition subsumes the processes of
data generation, capture, storage and archiving whereby data origi—
nating in human and social contexts are amassed in a data reposi—
tory. Exploitation refers to the means by which these data are
processed and managed to be readied for access for health service
provision, audit and evaluation and/or by research users for analysis
and interpretation which can itself generate individual—level data
which may be returned to the repository. Analysis and interpretation
may span a broad spectrum involving hypothesis— or model—driven
methods and/or data mining and hypothesis—free approaches to
knowledge discovery.

It is the need to properly manage the ﬂows of data along the
data pipeline as well as into and between acquisition and exploit-
ation that creates the necessity for trustworthy research environ—
ments within which to house the requisite systems and processes,
and such environments may conveniently be called Data Safe
Havens (DSHs). The three words constituting this term hint at the
fundamental physical nature of these entities and, at the same time,
imply an important dichotomy of primary aims. As a physical entity
a Data Safe Haven is a physical repository for data that occupies a

 

defined location in space and across time. As to its purpose, it has
two complementary roles: (i) to manage information in a manner
that ensures data fidelity, data quality and data utility; and (ii) to
keep the data safe in the sense that they are used in ways that are
consistent with all applicable governance considerations and avoid
harm or distress for research participants (data contributors), gener—
ators, users or for the repository itself. In this sense a Data Safe
Haven may be seen as a collection of structures and processes that
ensure data integrity and make them available for research, health—
care or other secondary processes such as population health moni—
toring and health service planning. But this simple definition needs
some elaboration, specifically in relation to the possible mechanisms
for access; this might lead us to recognize different classes of Data
Safe Haven.

There are three fundamental ways that individual—level data
[:‘microdata’ (OECD Expert Group for International Collaboration
on Microdata Access, 2014)]—or the information contained in such
data—might reasonably be accessed. First, the data themselves could
be held in a repository and released to potential users, with or without
governance controls on that release. At present this class of data reposi—
tory is the commonest in the field of biomedical and health science (e.g.
NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre [http://www.hscic.
gov.uk], 1958 Birth Cohort (Power and Elliott, 2006), CARTaGENE
[www.cartagene.qc.ca/en/researcher—access], dbGaP [www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/gap], European Genome—phenome Archive [https://www.ebi.
ac.uk/ega/], ICGC Data Portal [https://dcc.icgc.org/], UK Biobank
(Collins and and UK Biobank Steering Committee, 2007), UK Data
Archive [www.data—archive.ac.uk]). Second, the data could be held in a
repository which users can access to analyse those data, but they can—
not see or extract the data, and the analytic routines which are avail—
able to them may include formal disclosure controls—e.g. no release of
contingency tables if any cell count is between 1 and 4. Approaches to
doing this already exist and include systems that vary from major IT in—
frastructural projects such as the UK Data Service Secure Lab [http://
ukdataservice.ac.uk/use—data/secure—lab.aspx]), to open source solutions
such as DataSHIELD (Gaye et al., 2014; Wolfson et al., 2010) and
ViPAR (Chi, 2013). Approaches under either of these first two classes
may require users to physically visit the location where the servers
holding the data are based (NHS Scotland National Safe Haven, 2014;
{OECD Expert Group for International Collaboration on Microdata
Access, 2014 #5792}, or may involve appropriately secured remote ac—
cess (Gaye et al., 2014; Karr et al., 2007). A third class of repository
might directly release data to applicants, but in a modified form that
mitigates disclosure risk. As examples, this may include: restriction of
data release to study—level summary statistics; lesser degrees of data col—
lapse involving resolution into tables that are non—disclosive (Di Iorio
et al., 2013) possibly with formal control of disclosure risk via k—ano—
nymization (Sweeney, 2002); addition of random noise [e.g. noise—
based differential privacy mechanisms (Dwork, 2006)] or the gener—
ation of synthetic data (simulated data with an equivalent joint distri—
bution to a set of real data; Karr and Reiter, 2014). Each of these
classes of Data Safe Haven may require different mechanisms to ensure
that they are safe.

All of these models of sharing biomedical data have pros and
cons. For example, there may be some loss of information content
from the original data and no approach to data release can ever
completely guarantee that disclosure is impossible. But it is our view
that provided a repository meets the criteria defining data quality
and safety that are appropriate to the particular data it holds, all
such approaches should have the potential to be viewed as a Data
Safe Haven. It is true that some of these may focus particularly
closely on data security while others may focus on streamlining and

simplifying data access, but provided they are compliant with the
key criteria, and are fit for purpose examples from all classes might

3 What makes for a Data Safe Haven?

Regardless of its origins and initial meaning, common and intuitive
usage of the term suggests that if an entity is to be viewed as a Data
Safe Haven, it must first be able to store and release data faithfully
and effectively. Second, it must be able to do this in a manner that
might reasonably be viewed as safe and trustworthy by all key stake—
holders: e.g. research participants (data contributors), data gener—
ators, repository staff, data users, research ethics committees, etc.

To formalize the process of determining whether a particular
data repository is ‘faithful to its data’ and that all systems and proc—
esses may be regarded as safe, it might reasonably be argued that a
series of specific but ﬂexible and responsive criteria should be met:
data maintenance and access processes must be socially acceptable
and appropriate; any use must be based on data that are veritable,
meaning that they must be maintained and released in a form that is
faithful to their origins, and; to warrant the moniker ‘safe’, it must
be secure and must be seen to be secure. In other words, a Data Safe
Haven should be trustworthy and its underlying systems and policies
should operate in an entirely transparent manner. With further de—
velopment and evaluation, these same criteria for describing Data
Safe Havens may also be considered criteria for assessing the status
of a repository. A preliminary set of criteria is presented below
(Table 1). However, it is important to recognize that we do not
claim these are the optimal or the only criteria to use. Rather, we be—
lieve these criteria provide a starting point for defining and identify—
ing trustworthy research environments that might be worthy of the
title ‘Data Safe Haven’. They also provide a framework for formally
evaluating and accrediting such safe havens.

3.1 Data maintenance and release must be socially

acceptable and appropriate

1. Consistent with formal ethical and legal requirements. This in—
cludes compliance with relevant national and international

legislation (e.g. data protection legislation), consents, informa—
tion documentation and any other ethical, legal or governance
controls that applied when the data were originally generated
(including from biosamples). It also includes meeting formal
governance requirements that may apply to the repository itself
or to users of the data, e.g. formal permission from a data access
committee, formal data transfer agreements, deﬁnitions of a
hona ﬁde user.

2. Responsive to emerging issues, e.g. whether to return clinically
relevant research results. Appropriate mechanisms and systems
must be in place to respond in a timely, inclusive (i.e. involving
all relevant stakeholders) and appropriate manner to emerging
socio—technical (e.g. introduction of a new technology or
analytic method with potential to impact identiﬁability) or
socio—ethical (e.g. analysis which reveals clinically relevant ﬁnd—
ings) issues.

3. Discoverahle and accessible. It must be possible—and ideally
straightforward—for potential users to ﬁnd out what data are
held by a repository and how to apply to access them. This
should include up—to—date provision of readily accessible
metadata.

4. Transparent and accountable. All policies and written agree—
ments underpinning a repository’s processes for data manage—
ment (including any legal contracts under Criterion 1) should be
properly documented, and freely available to anybody upon
whom they may impact (including data participants). This
should include up—to—date provision of repository policies, appli—
cation forms and any legal controls, e.g. data transfer agree—
ments, or data protection statutes that may apply. In particular,
any decisions regarding access to data should be based on for—
mally stated criteria that are ﬁt—for—purpose—neither too re—
strictive nor too laissez faire —readily interpretable and are seen
to be fairly applied. In case of dispute regarding an access deci—
sion, there should be a transparent and independent appeals pro—
cess. There should also be clearly speciﬁed sanctions that would
apply in the case of violation of an agreed principle; sanctions
which should be appropriately calibrated to the nature of the
violations that have necessitated them. This is a developing area.

3.2 Data must be veritable

5. Data and metadata ﬁdelity. The data and metadata that may be
accessed from a repository should directly reﬂect the data that
were originally lodged in that repository, or should reﬂect an
agreed transformation (or recorded update/correction) of those
original data. This should be true regardless when or how those
data may later be accessed.

6. Quality assurance and control. Appropriate quality assurance
systems should be in place to facilitate identiﬁcation and subse—
quent correction of data errors.

7. Curation and archiving. All data and systems must be effectively
maintained to ensure digital continuity and that systems do not
become obsolete or the data irretrievable and should include suf—
ﬁcient documentation and metadata to allow users to interpret
data in the context in which they were collected.

8. Effective hackup routines. All data and systems should be appro—
priately and regularly backed up.

9. Effective audit. If a repository is to be relied upon as a safe
source of high quality data, it is important not only that it for—
mally meets all of the criteria considered above, but that it is
possible for it to demonstrate that these criteria are met and con—
tinue to be met. Ideally this should be assessed through

independent assessment. This demands an effective audit pro—
gram. Auditing is also one of the main tools for proﬁling second—
ary uses of data by authorized users.

3.3 Data must be safe and secure

10. Preserve conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the reposi-
tory. All systems and resources should have appropriate safe—
guards to preserve conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of
the repository. These should include physical, administrative,
and technical controls such as secure storage facilities, key/pass—
word management procedures, ﬁrewalls, virus scanners, audit
logging and non—repudiation mechanisms. Safeguards (e.g. ap—
propriate encryption) should be designed to protect data in tran—
sit, whether inside or outside the trust boundary. Security
safeguards and management systems should meet relevant
standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 27000—series). A repository should also
enforce basic security measures on data users—e.g. by making
the award of data conditional on the data being kept on a pass—
word protected server—these measures would be explicitly
documented as per Criteria 1 and 4, above.

11. Appropriate secure access to identifying data. Where necessary,
the data custodian must be able to: (i) access identifying data,
and; (ii) link those data back to source data, derived data and
biosamples. This linkage facility is critical for error correction,
in case of withdrawal of consent, for feedback of clinically rele—
vant ﬁndings and in managing some longitudinal data.

12. Appropriate protection of identifying data. Although individu—
ally identifying data must sometimes be accessible (see 11) they
should not be released unless a suitable body deems it absolutely
necessary (e.g. for use in a clinical setting or because an import—
ant scientiﬁc question demands it). Such release may result in
the identiﬁcation of individual study participants and/or infor—
mation about them being released into the public domain.

3.4 Data Safe Haven Criteria are context specific
Crucially, the particular actions required to ensure that each of these
criteria is met are context-specific. For example, in relation to
Criterion 8—which focuses on the appropriate management of data
that are potentially identifying — even data items that are individually
non—disclosive can become highly identifying if combined together
(Golle, 2006). At the same time, it is sometimes necessary for scien—
tific reasons to release data that have a relatively high risk of disclos—
ure, e.g. the use of anonymization and de—identification mechanisms
can sometimes vitiate the utility of data for certain important re—
search purposes (Erlich and Narayanan, 2014). Taken together,
these observations imply: (i) a zero risk of disclosure is an unattain—
able objective and should never be promised, and; (ii) it may well be
reasonable to try to strike a balance between the scientific value of a
particular set of data, and the risk that it may lead to disclosure.
Where that balance should lie might be expected to vary with the
importance of the scientific question being addressed and the poten—
tial impact of an individual being identified and his/her data being
revealed. For example, it may well differ between data generated
from a study of HIV/AIDS, where individual disclosure may be
highly stigmatizing, and data from a cohort study focusing on child—
hood asthma. Crucially, determination of such questions of the bal—
ance of social and scientific good cannot be left to one set of
stakeholders, be they the data custodian, user, participant or other
stakeholder. All perspectives are relevant.

3.5 A Data Safe Haven does not operate in isolation
Although we believe that in order for an entity to be designated a
Data Safe Haven it should satisfy all criteria recommended, the en—
tity itself need not wholly be responsible for all the work underpin—
ning each criterion. Thus, the European GenomeJPhenome Archive
and the UK Data Archive would both be viewed as Data Safe
Havens, and both hold data generated by the 1958 Birth Cohort.
But, for all but straightforward access requests, the oversight of ac—
cess to biomedical data from 195 8BC is actually enacted else—
where—through the Access Committee for CLS Cohorts. A Data
Safe Haven must address all criteria in a manner consistent with the
nature and purpose of the data it holds—but some criteria may rea—
sonably be met via systems and mechanisms that are managed
elsewhere.

3.6 Other characteristics that supplement Data Safe
Haven criteria

Other characteristics might also be considered desirable for a reposi—
tory to exhibit. These include: (i) timeliness—ensuring that applica—
tions are turned round with sufficient speed to avoid inconveniencing
applicants; and (ii) simplicity—avoiding an application mechanism
that is so complex that it puts potential applicants off from applying.

4 Conclusion: so what is a Data Safe Haven?

This paper claims that, regardless of how the concept of a Data Safe
Haven may originally have emerged (Directorate of Information
Services MEL(1992)42, 1992; NHS Research Capability
Programme, 2008) and regardless of its potential legal use in certain
jurisdictions (Caldicott, 2013), the term has evolved in meaning
over time and as it has started to be employed world—wide. Its com—
mon (intuitive) usage is now consistent with a broad definition that,
in effect, states that a Data Safe Haven is a data repository in which
biomedical and/or social data can be stored and accessed in a man—
ner that reliably maintains their fidelity and quality but also ensures
that the data are ‘safe’ in the sense that all relevant social expect—
ations and ethical and legal controls on their use and dissemination
are appropriately met. Crucially, it is important to note that the enti—
ties that were first called Data Safe Havens by the UK NHS in the
19905 undoubtedly meet this definition, but they are now just one
class of Data Safe Haven amongst a rich array of alternatives.

As things currently stand, with no formal definition of the term
Data Safe Haven, any repository could arguably decide to award it—
self the title. But the term is so useful—and potentially so potent as a
tool in engaging the wider community and enhancing understanding
of health—related data management—that such loose treatment
would weaken its value. To provide greater clarity of the dimensions
of a Data Safe Haven, we have described a series of 12 criteria that
we believe should be met before a repository can claim the status of
a Data Safe Haven. We are sure that this particular set of criteria
could be improved upon—and perhaps should be discussed and
agreed upon at an international forum, possibly convened by the
Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. Yet, we are convinced
that not only is an agreed set of such criteria necessary, but also that
it is achievable. Crucially, whether a particular repository should or
should not be viewed as a Data Safe Haven is strictly dependent on
the classes of data it might hold. For example, ethical, legal and
quality control criteria, and the spectrum of hona fide data users,
may vary markedly, and entirely appropriately, between: (i) com—
plex phenotypic data collected by a research—focused cohort study;
(ii) routine hospitalization data generated by a health service; (iii)

genotypic data arising from a large population—based set of healthy
controls, and; (iv) linked data integrating primary care records with
educational achievement; and (v) data of potential commercial sensi—
tivity that big Pharma may want to leverage in a pre—competitive
space between companies.

In our view, the appropriate definition of a Data Safe Haven
which is consistent with the ways in which the term is widely used
depends primarily on a repository ensuring that its systems, mechan—
isms, and policies are transparent, comprehensive and rigorous
when judged against the appropriate criteria of data quality and
safety that apply to the particular data that it holds, and are appro—
priately audited to ensure ongoing consistency with those same crite—
ria. If such a definition is to be meaningful, there is a need to
develop national and international programs and evaluation mech—
anisms to enable a formal status of Data Safe Haven to be awarded.

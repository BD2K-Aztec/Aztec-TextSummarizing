ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identification of condition specific sub-networks
from gene expression profiles has important biological applications,
ranging from the selection of disease-related biomarkers to the
discovery of pathway alterations across different phenotypes.
Although many methods exist for extracting these sub-networks,
very few existing approaches simultaneously consider both the
differential expression of individual genes and the differential
correlation of gene pairs, losing potentially valuable information in
the data.

Results: In this article, we propose a new method, COSINE
(COndition Specific sub-NEtwork), which employs a scoring function
that jointly measures the condition-specific changes of both ‘nodes’
(individual genes) and ‘edges’ (gene—gene co-expression). It uses
the genetic algorithm to search for the single optimal sub-network
which maximizes the scoring function. We applied COSINE to both
simulated datasets with various differential expression patterns, and
three real datasets, one prostate cancer dataset, a second one
from the across-tissue comparison of morbidly obese patients and
the other from the across-population comparison of the HapMap
samples. Compared with previous methods, COSINE is more
powerful in identifying truly significant sub-networks of appropriate
size and meaningful biological relevance.

1 INTRODUCTION

Various statistical methods exist for comparative analysis of two
or more sets of microarray data. Based on how prior knowledge
is utilized, these methods can be generally classiﬁed into four
categories [a similar classiﬁcation scheme was presented in Nacu
et (11. (2007)]: (i) single gene-based differential expression analysis.
These methods start by quantifying the level of differential

expression of individual genes using various statistics [for a
comprehensive review, see Dudoit et (11. (2002)]. Genes with
signiﬁcant P-values are then checked for enrichment in predeﬁned
biological processes or pathways using annotation tools such as
DAVID (Dennis et (11., 2003; Huang et (11., 2009). This approach
is simple and intuitive. However, the choice of a signiﬁcance level
for the P-values can be arbitrary, and this approach ignores the
dependency between genes. (ii) Gene set-based differential analysis,
among which the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Subramanian,
et (11., 2005) is a well-known example. For a good review and
method comparison, see Ackermann and Strimmer (2009). This class
of approaches has the advantage of clear biological interpretation;
however, it relies on the prior knowledge of gene sets (genes
in the same pathway or related to the same disease), which
is still far from being complete and accurate. Moreover, under
many circumstances, only a subset of genes in a pathway exhibit
expression alterations, and testing on the whole set may give rise
to false negatives (Yan and Sun, 2008). (iii) Topology-based gene
co-expression network analysis. Horvath and colleagues developed
the weighted gene co-expression network analysis, WGCNA
(Langfelder and Horvath, 2008), which is a clustering method taking
into account topological similarity between genes. However, for
high-dimensional datasets (e.g. > 1000 genes), clustering methods
may lead to very large modules, making interpretation based on
gene ontology (GO) annotation less informative. (iv) Responsive
sub-network identiﬁcation using graph search methods. Here the
goal is to identify a subset of genes showing condition-speciﬁc
changes. This class of methods has two main components: a scoring
function quantifying the alternation of a given sub-network between
different conditions, and a search algorithm to extract the highest
scoring sub-networks. The seminal work of Iderker et (11. (2002)
used sum of z-score (which is the standard normal inverse of a
single gene’s P-value) adjusted for the size of the sub-network as
the scoring function, and employed simulated annealing to search for
the best sub-networks. Guo et (11. (2007) used an edge-based scoring
function rather than node score to account for gene—gene correlation.
Due to the non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) nature
of the problem of ﬁnding the maximal-scoring connected sub-
graph, it can only be approached by heuristic or approximate
methods. Apart from simulated annealing, previous studies have
also employed local greedy search algorithms (Breitling et (11 ., 2004;
Nacu et (11., 2007; Rajagopalan and Agarwal, 2005; Ulitsky et (11.,

2008) and various mathematical programming or graph theory-
based exact approaches. For example, Qiu et (11. (2009) used a
mixed integer linear programming model to identify differentially
expressed pathways. Dittrich et (11. (2008) transformed the problem
into the well-known prize-collecting Steiner tree problem (PCST).
Wang and Xia (2008) incorporated both nodes and edges in their
scoring ﬁinction and used an iterative algorithm to solve the local
optimization problem. Qiu et (11. (2010) exploited a regression model
with diffusion kernel to detect disease-associated modules and to
prioritize responsive genes.

The last category of methods requires little prior knowledge and
has great ﬂexibility in terms of differential expression analysis.
However, except for Wang and Xia (2008), methods in this class
consider either node or edge, but not both, in their scoring functions
(Wu et (11., 2009). This can be inefﬁcient since many studies
have demonstrated that disease conditions are marked not only by
differential expression of single genes, but also by alterations in
the gene pair correlation or other higher order topologies (Barrenas
et (11., 2009; Feldman et (11., 2008; Franke et (11., 2006; Goh et (11.,
2007; Kohler et (11 ., 2008; Krauthammer et (11 ., 2004; Lee et (11., 2008;
Linghu et (11., 2009; Park et (11., 2009; Wu et (11., 2008). The necessity
of taking a network perspective in identifying disease-related sub-
networks was also implicated in a study of type 2 diabetes (Liu et (11 .,
2007), in which the authors failed to detect transcriptionally altered
insulin-signaling gene sets using single gene-based state of the art
methods such as DEA and GSEA. As for the method of (Wang and
Xia, 2008), it was not designed for expression data analysis and it
aims at identifying many small locally optimal sub-networks rather
than a globally optimal one.

The proposed method COSINE is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst
algorithm (i) that considers the weighted contribution of both
nodes and edges inspired by network alignment studies; and (ii)
that searches for the single globally optimal sub-network, which
may perform better than those selecting many locally optimal sub-
networks. In the following, we ﬁrst describe the basic methodology
of COSINE and then show its applications to both simulated and
real datasets.

2 METHODS
2.1 The scoring function of COSINE

Given two or more microarray expression proﬁles under different conditions
(several tissue types. normal versus diseased samples. etc.). COSINE aims to
identify a sub-network of genes showing maximal alternation in terms of the
holistic expression pattern. The whole background network is represented
as a graph G: (V,E). where V represents all the nodes and E represents all
the edges. For each node. the F -statistic is used to measure the differential
expression of each gene. Let g denote the number of different groups. xi]-
denote the j—th observation of gene X in the i-th group. n, denote the sample
size of the i-th group. fr,» be the sample mean of gene X of the i-th group. It be
the sample mean of all observations. where i=1,2,...,g andj: 1,2,...,ni
and n is the total number of observations. The F -statistic is computed as:

F = ZimO—Ci —)_€)2/(g— 1)

Zi,j(Xi,j —)_Ci)2/(”—g)
For each edge. the Expected Conditional F -statistic (ECF-statistic) is used
to measure the differential geneigene co-expression across different groups.
For a detailed derivation of the ECF-statistic. see Lai et a1. (2004). Assuming

a bivariate normal distribution of two genes X and Y in the i-th group.

The ECF-statistic of gene X given the expression value of gene Y
Ey(Fxly:y) is calculated as:

The ECF-statistic of an edge linking genes X and Y is deﬁned as:

I
ECF(X~ Y): E [EY(FXlY:y)+EX(FYlX:x)]

The F -statistic and ECF-statistic are then standardized against the whole
pool of nodes/edges to generate the node score and edge score used in the
scoring function as follows:

Fv—FV

ECF(e) — ECFE

NodeScore (v) = EdgeScore (e) 2
Let G’ = (V’ ,E’) denote a sub-network of G with size k. where E’ represents
all the edges connecting the k nodes in V’. The score of G’ is:

MOSA 51) is a weight parameter controlling the respective contribution
of the edge score and node score. whereas the denominator adjusts for the
size of the sub-network. In cases where the proteiniprotein interaction (PPI)
network is used to deﬁne the existence of an edge. we simply change the
denominator of the edge score term to the square root of the total number of
edges in the selected sub-network.

Score(G’) 2A

 

2.2 Using the genetic algorithm to search for the
highest scoring sub-network

Extraction of the highest scoring sub-network is identical to the global
optimization problem of ﬁnding a binary vector of length [7 (the total number
of genes) where the i-th element in the vector being 1 corresponds to this
gene being included in the sub-network; and 0 otherwise. Since the size of the
search space is 21’ . it is computationally prohibitive to perform an exhaustive
search when p is large. The genetic algorithm is a global search algorithm
commonly used on high-dimensional binary optimization. It takes the binary
vectors as chromosomes and mimics the genetic recombination. mutation
and other evolutionary processes to search for the highest scoring binary
vector. Important parameters in the genetic algorithm include: (i) mutation
rate: the probability that a gene in the chromosome mutates; (ii) zero to one
ratio: the ratio of number of Os to number of Is on the binary chromosome
for mutations and initiation. which is used to control the number of genes
selected; (iii) population size: the number of individuals in each iteration;
and (iv) elitism: the number of chromosomes kept into next generation. The
function ‘rbga.bin’ in the R package ‘genalg’ is used in our application of
the genetic algorithm.

2.3 Simulated data

To investigate the performance of our approach. we simulated seven datasets.
including one reference dataset (called control in the following) and six
datasets to be compared to the control dataset (called case datasets in the
following). from multivariate normal distributions. These seven datasets had

different means and covariance matrices. where the variances were ﬁxed at 1.
Each dataset consists of 500 genes and 20 samples. We use p. to denote mean
and p to denote correlation coefﬁcient. Compared to the control dataset. a
total of 50 genes formed the condition-speciﬁc sub-network for case datasets
2. 3. 4. 5 and the sub-network consisted of 40 genes in the case dataset 6. The
case dataset 1 serves as the negative control where the data were generated in
the same way as the control dataset. More details are given below for these
seven datasets.
Control group: p. = p = 0 for all genes (to be compared with each of the six
case sets for the identiﬁcation of the optimal sub-network).
Case set 1 .' p. = p = 0 for all genes (negative control).
Case set 2 (both differential expression and differential correlation): Gene
1 to Gene 50 have )1 = 0.75. and p = 0.6 between each gene pair; the other
450 genes have )1 =p = 0.
Case set 3 (only differential expression. no differential correlation): Gene 1
to Gene 50 have )1 = 0.75. and p = 0 between each gene pair; the other 450
genes have )1 = p = 0.
Case set 4 (only differential correlation. no differential expression): Gene 1
to Gene 50 have )1 = 0. and p = 0.6 between each gene pair; the other 450
genes have )1 = p = 0.
Case set 5: Gene 1 to Gene 25 have )1 20.75. and p 20.6 between each
pair; Gene 26 to Gene 50 have 112—075 and p=O.6 between each pair
of them; p: —0.6 between any gene from 1 to 25 and any gene from 26 to
50. The other 450 genes have )1 = 0 and p = 0 (differential correlation and
differential expression with both up and down regulation).
Case set 6: 10 genes from each of set 2. set 3. set 4 and set 5. the other 460
genes from set 1 (mixed pattern of differential expression and differential
correlation).

We also conducted simulations based on the observed covariance matrices
from the obesity dataset and this is described in the Supplementary Material.

2.4 Real data
(1) PP] data: we used the database of HPRD (Human Protein Reference
Database. http://www.hprd.org/download). Release 9. 2010 (Keshava
Prasad et al.. 2009; Mishra et al.. 2006; Peri et al.. 2003).
After excluding self-interactions. there remained 37 080 binary PPIs
involving 9465 genes.

Prostate cancer (PC) data: this gene expression omnibus (GEO)
dataset. GSE3933 (Lapointe et al.. 2004). contains the gene
expression proﬁles of 71 prostate tumor samples and 41 normal
samples. First. we selected the common probes covered by the three
arrays. Then within each array. we imputed missing values for each
probe using the mean of available observations and the data was
normalized to have mean 0 and SD 1. We computed the expression of
genes as the mean value of the expression level of probes mapped to
that gene. For the following analysis. we only considered the genes
that are also included in the PPI network. which consists of 5335
genes (nodes) and 18 249 interactions (edges).

(3) Genes foranalysis in (4) and (5 ): since the original dataset contained a
large number of genes (> 10 000). it is computationally too demanding
to analyze them all. Meanwhile. we are more interested in the
genes related to various diseases and quantitative traits. Therefore.
we collected a candidate gene list from ‘A Catalog of Published
Genome-Wide Association Studies” at the National Human Genome
Research Institute (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/). We used all
the annotated genes in this catalog as of 2/1/2010. which consists of
1667 genes associated with 265 traits.

Tissue expression data of morbidly obese patients: this dataset
collects the whole genome expression proﬁle of liver. omental and
subcutaneous adipose tissues of a large sample of morbidly obese
individuals [more details can be found in Zhong et al. (2010)]. The
original data were measured on 40 638 probes. For simplicity. we
focused on the 456 subjects with data available for all three tissue

types and the subset of 1667 genes in (3) covered by the probes
(when one gene is covered by more than one probe. we used the mean
expression value of the multiple probes to represent the expression
levels of that gene). We then excluded genes with >10% missing
observations and subjects with > 10% missing genes. The remaining
missing values were imputed using the mean of available samples.
After processing. there remained 420 subjects and 1327 genes for
analysis.

(5) HapMap expression data of Asian (CHB+JPT) (ASN), CEUP
and YRIP samples: expression data of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-
transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of individuals used in the
phases I & II of the HapMap project (Stranger et al.. 2007). We
considered the populations of ASN [combination of 45 Han Chinese
in Beijing. China (CHB) and 45 Japanese in Tokyo. Japan (JPT)
individuals]. CEPH (Utah residents with ancestry from northern
and western Europe) (CEU)-parents (60 individuals) and Yoruba
in Ibadan. Nigeria (YRI)-parents (60 individuals) because they are
genetically unrelated. We ﬁrst conducted rank and inverse standard
normal transformations of the data within each population while
keeping the original mean and SD of each gene. using the method
described by (Li. 2002). The total number of probes is 40 273. After a
data ﬁltering procedure similar to that described above. there remained
1145 genes to be analyzed for the 210 subjects.

2.5 Choice of weight parameter A

An appropriate choice of A is essential for the scoring function and
optimization result. In order to achieve a reasonable balance between
the node and edge scores. we ﬁrst compared the magnitude of the
‘edge_score_term’ and ‘node_score_term’:

ZEdgeScore(e)/  ZNodeScore(v)/x/k

eeE/ veV/

using the Case set 1 and the Control Group simulated as described in
Section 2.3. For each of the 11 k values ranging from 25 to 75 by a step size
of 5. 2000 sub-networks were randomly sampled from the background pool
of 500 genes. generating 11 populations of both score terms. The distribution
plots (Supplementary Figures 81 and S2) show that sub-networks of different
sizes share similar distributions for the two score terms. A further look at
the distribution of log10(|  |) (Supplementary Figure S3) shows
that the majority (>95% of the 2000 log-ratio values for each k) fall in
the region of (—0.5. 1.5). We then calculated the ﬁve quantiles (minimum.
25%; median. 75%; and maximum) of the log-ratios for each population.
and averaged each quantile across the 11 populations. denoted as vector r. in
order to get a reasonable estimate of the quantiles for networks of different
sizes. Accordingly. we set A): #0212345). See Table 1 for the
values of r and A used in this article.

As to the ﬁnal choice of A among the ﬁve quantiles. we used the
following procedure: (i) randomly sample a large number (e.g. 10000)
of sub-networks with sizes ~10% of the entire background gene pool (or
some other percentage based on how large a sub-network the user intends
to extract); (ii) derive the averaged ﬁve quantiles of A. and use each A to
identify a sub-network. Denote the scores of the selected sub-network as f ;
(iii) for each of the ﬁve As. randomly sample 1000 sub-networks of the same
size with the one chosen by COSINE. and calculate their scores. thereby
generating ﬁve score populations; (iv) compute the mean )1 and standard
deviation s of each score population. then the adjusted score = (f — p.)/s; and
(V) Choose the A whose corresponding sub-network has the highest adjusted
score. As to the analysis combining PPI data and gene expression data. the
choice of quantile values is the same. For the ﬁnal choice of A. we randomly
sampled the same number of nodes and the same number of edges as the
selected sub-network. and repeated the sampling for ~10 000 times to derive
the mean and SD of the scores.

2.6 Performance assessment

Recall. precision and the combined F -measure were used to evaluate the
performance of different methods. Let TP denote the number of correctly
identiﬁed genes. FP denote the number of falsely identiﬁed genes and FN
denote the number of falsely unidentiﬁed genes. The traditional F -measure
or balanced F -score (F 1 -score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
and can be used as a measure of total accuracy when equal importance is
attached to recall and precision (Van Rij sbergen. 1979). Then.

2.7 Analysis of various topological measures of single
trait-associated gene networks

For genes associated with each of the 265 traits [as described in
(1) of Section 2.4]. we constructed co-expression networks for the
liver/omental/subcutaneous data. as well as the ASN/CEUP/YRIP data.
resulting in six groups of co-expression networks. Five representative
topological metrics were computed for these networks of different sizes.
including (i) mean connectivity. (ii) mean clustering coefﬁcient. (iii)
density. (iv) heterogeneity and (v) centralization. using the function
‘fundarnentalNetworkConcepts’ in the R package WGCNA (Langfelder and
Horvath. 2008). We then derived the across-tissue and across-population
variance of each metric for each co-expression network. In order to assess the
signiﬁcance of these variances. 1000 sub-networks of the same size with each
trait-associated gene network were randomly sampled from the background
gene pool to form a null distribution of the variances. A P-value was then
computed based on how frequently we observed a variance larger than the
original one.

mutation rate to 0.005 and the iteration number to 300. The results
of COSINE using ﬁve different A’s for each set are summarized in
Figure 1. It can be seen from the plots that the A allows the ﬁne-
tuning of the relative contribution of edge and node, thus favoring
the selection of different types of sub-networks: smaller A (more
weight on the node term) favors the selection of sub-networks with
signiﬁcant differential expression (DE), such as set 3; whereas larger
A (more weight on the edge term) shows better performance for
identifying sub-networks with differential gene—gene correlation
patterns (DC), such as set 4. For sets showing both DE and DC (set 2,
set 5 and set 6), the performance of COSINE is more consistent for
different As. In the case of set 1 (negative control), the identiﬁed
sub-networks are not enriched for Genes 1 to 50, as expected.

We then compared the sub-network with the highest adjusted
score (as described in Section 2.5; see Supplementary Table S1
(a) for detailed results) with the result of ‘jActiveModules’ (Ideker
et (11., 2002), the edge-based method (Guo et (11., 2007) and
the combined method of (Wang and Xia, 2008), as shown in
Table 2 (see ‘Supplementary Material: Methods’ for further details
of method implementation). Since the method of Wang and Xia
(2008) aims to identify a series of locally optimal sub-networks
rather than a single globally optimal one (which is different from
the objective of COSINE), the comparison with their result is not that
straightforward. In each iteration of the local search, their method
identiﬁes a small sub-network (usually <5 genes), extracts this sub-
network, eliminates the afﬁliated nodes from the background pool
and then starts a new iteration. We chose to look at the union of the
genes identiﬁed in the ﬁrst 13 iterations of local search in order to
obtain approximately the same number of genes in the sub-network
to assess the selection performance of their method.

Compared with the other three methods, COSINE achieves higher
recall, precision and F -measure in most cases except for the negative

control set 1. The sub-network chosen by jActiveModules (jAM)
is generally too large. Therefore, although the recall of jAM is
satisfactory, its precision is very low. As for the edge-based method,
it fails to select a sub-network for all six datasets (all 500 nodes are
still retained after 10 000 iterations). The rationale of the edge-based
method is to eliminate the edges in the original network one by one
and then remove all the nodes with degree of 0 in each iteration of
simulated annealing. Although it can be applied to the analysis of
PPI networks which are highly sparse, its performance on gene—
gene co-expression networks is poor because the co-expression
networks are complete, thus even removing a large number of edges
may not reduce the number of connected nodes. In fact, the output
network of the edge-based method does contain much fewer edges
than that of the input background network [which has C (500,
2): 124 750 edges], ranging from 62 159 to 62 353. Nevertheless,
no nodes can be removed since their degrees are still non-zero. The
local method of Wang and Xia (2008) performs better than both
jAM and the edge-based method. However, as for set 4, which
has only differential correlation to a modest extent (,0=0.6) and
no differential expression; COSINE’s performance is signiﬁcantly
better than all the other methods.

3.2 Method comparison on PC data with integration of
PPIs

We then compared the performance of COSINE with other methods
on the real data of PC, in combination of the PPI network
information. The parameter setting of COSINE was: number of
iteration = 5000; mutation Rate = 0.05; and zero to one ratio = 30. For
all the other three methods, we used the default parameter settings in
their software or program code and set iteration = 5000 for jAM and
the edge-based method. As in the case for simulated data, in each
iteration of the local method, only a very small sub-network was
extracted, so we combined the genes selected in the ﬁrst 33 iterations
in order to make the total number of selected genes roughly equal
to that of COSINE (the original paper of the local method did not
describe how to choose the number of iterations). Using the ﬁve
quantiles of A, COSINE selected sub-networks with sizes 98, 142,
199, 243, 232, with the fourth quantile giving rise to the highest
adjusted score. For method evaluation, we collected genes related
to PC from the Dragon Database of Genes associated with Prostate
Cancer (DDPC) (Maqungo et (11., 2011). We chose this database
because: (i) genes included in DDPC are all experimentally veriﬁed
to be associated with PC, providing clear molecular context for the

gene’s ﬁinction; (ii) it is much more comprehensive (including 704
PC genes in all) and updated than previous databases such as Prostate
Gene Database (PGDB) (Li et (11., 2003), containing only 162 PC
genes. Among the 704 genes, 400 are included in the 5335 genes of
our dataset. The sub-network selection results of different methods
are shown in Table 3. Consistent with previous comparison on
simulated data, the jAM and edge-based method extracted too large
a sub-network, 1669 and 4339 out of 5335 genes, respectively. Fold
enrichment shows that COSINE performs the best in identifying
PC genes, followed by the edge-based method, whereas the fold
enrichment of jAM and the local method is only slightly >1.

We also checked kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes
(KEGG) pathway enrichment using DAVID. It turned out that most
PC-related pathways could be identiﬁed via all the four methods,
such as ‘Regulation of actin cytoskeleton’, ‘MAPK signaling
pathway’, ‘Chemokine signaling pathway’, etc. However, jAM
and the edge-based method returned too long a list of enriched
pathways, a signiﬁcant proportion of which show little relation to
PC. Therefore, the fold enrichment statistic is a more objective
criterion for comparison. Although it is possible that gene expression
in PC might be widely changed, and whether the extracted sub-
network is biologically meaningful should not be judged based on
its size, it is still preferred for feature selection methods (including
all the sub-network extraction methods discussed here) to retrieve
a small subset of the original features with the best discriminative
power, which is exactly the goal of COSINE.

Analysis in this article was done on a Dell PowerEdge 1955
server containing two-dual core 3.0 GHz Xeon 64 bit EM64T Intel
cpus model 5160, 16GB RAM. For the PC dataset of 5335 genes
and 18249 PPIs, it took about 6.5h to ﬁnish 5000 iterations. In
order to test the convergence of the genetic algorithm, we reran the
program with the fourth quantile of A, and iteration: 10000 and

20 000. The fold enrichment for PC-related genes increases with
more iterations of the genetic algorithm, which is 1.317 and 1.328,
respectively. Figure 2 shows the convergence of the mean and best
scores in each iteration of the genetic algorithm (because the R
package ‘genalg’ used for implementing the genetic algorithm aims
to minimize the objective function, the scores on the plot are minus
the actual scores of selected sub-network). It can be seen that after
15 000 iterations, the mean score stabilizes and the best score also
approaches a constant. In terms of practical use, we recommend that
the iteration number to be set around the total number of genes in
the dataset for balance between time and performance.

Gene prioritization within the selected sub-network can be easily
achieved by sequentially excluding each gene from the sub-network,
and calculating the decrease in the network score. The larger the
score loss, the higher ranked in the sub-network the excluded
gene. For example, applying the above procedure to the 243
genes selected with iteration=5000 shows that the top three genes
are ‘TGFBRl’, ‘PAFAHlBl’ and ‘COL17A1’. Their scaled node
score is 8.299, 10.351 and 10.343, indicating that the differential
expression of ‘TGFBRl’ is less signiﬁcant than the other two
genes. However, ‘TGFBRl’ participates in 50 edges within the sub-
network, whereas ‘PAFAHlB 1 ’ and ‘COL17A1 ’ both have only nine
edges. Therefore, the contribution of ‘TGFBRl’ is larger, which
makes sense considering the wide-range impact of the transforming
growth factor beta (TGF-ﬂ) signaling pathway.

3.3 Application to liver and omental gene expression
data of morbidly obese individuals

We then applied COSINE to the real dataset of the liver and omental
tissue expression proﬁle of morbidly obese patients, which contains
1327 genes after the pre-processing described in Section 2.4. The
mutation rate was set to 0.05 and iteration number to 1000. For
the ﬁve values of A, the sizes of the identiﬁed sub-networks are
80, 73, 41, 32 and 31 (the complete lists of selected genes are in
Supplementary Table S2), respectively. Supplementary Table S3
shows the pairwise intersection of the ﬁve sub-networks and
corresponding fold enrichment compared to the expected number
of common genes of two randomly chosen sub-networks of the
same size out of the whole pool of 1327 genes. For example,
the sizes of sub-networks 1 and 2 are 80 and 73, respectively,
so the expected number of common genes is 80*73/1327=4.4,
whereas the actual intersection consists of 36 genes with a fold

enrichment of 36/44: 8.18. As expected, the intersection of sub-
networks identiﬁed by adjacent A values is larger than that of distant
A values. No gene is selected by all the ﬁve different A’s. Another
interesting observation is that the sub-networks identiﬁed by A3, A4
and A5 have signiﬁcantly higher overlap compared with that of A1
and A2, which indicates that for this dataset, when more weight is
attached to differential correlation (edges) rather than differential
expression (nodes), the extracted tissue-speciﬁc sub-network tends
to be more consistent. For this dataset, jAM selects a sub-network of
size 677, which is about half the size of the background gene pool.

The sub-network with the highest adjusted score is given by A5.
Functional annotation of the 31 genes using DAVID (Dennis et (11.,
2003; Huang, et (11., 2009) identiﬁes several enriched biological
pathways, as shown in Supplementary Table S4. These pathways
are consistent with previous biological studies of tissue-speciﬁc
gene expression of obesity, as reviewed by (Kim and Park, 2010),
including pathways of ‘inﬂammation, immune response, adhesion
molecules, lipid metabolism, adipocyte differentiation, defense, and
stress responses’. We then compared our approach with traditional
separate DE and differential correlation (DC) analysis. After ranking
the 1327 genes solely based on the node score (F -statistic) or mean
edge score (averaged ECF-statistic with the other 1326 genes), we
looked at the top 31 genes based on such single measures. Since we
are doing two group comparison (liver tissue versus omental tissue),
the F -statistic is actually the square of the Student’s t-statistic. There
is no overlap between the 31 genes identiﬁed by COSINE and single
DE analysis, but 13 genes in common between COSINE and DC
analysis, which is expected since for this pair of datasets, the best
A is the largest one, so more weight is given to the edge score term
measuring differential correlation. Functional annotation results
for the genes are shown in Supplementary Table S4. Compared
with separate DE/DC analysis, COSINE assigns higher ranks and
signiﬁcantly smaller P-values to the obesity-related pathways.
Therefore, the joint consideration of both differential expression and
differential correlation has a higher potential in revealing unexpected
or less well-studied biological pathways which are deregulated in
diseases.

We then took a further look at selected edges exhibiting signiﬁcant
differential correlation between the liver and omental data. We
ranked the 465 edges among the 31 genes based on their scaled
ECF scores and found that the top 10 edges all include the
gene ‘CRP’, although the differential expression of this gene
is not signiﬁcant (scaled F -statistics=—0.43). C-reactive protein
(CRP) is synthesized by the liver in response to factors release
by fat cells. Its ﬁinction is to recognize foreign pathogens and
damaged cells of the host and to initiate their elimination by
interacting with humoral and cellular effector systems in the blood.
Partners of CRP for the top 10 edges are: ‘FGB’, ‘CYP2C9’,
‘ITIH1’, ‘CYP4F2’, ‘APOC3’, ‘ANGPTL3’, ‘CYP2C8’, ‘ADH6’,
‘SLCOlBl’ and ‘APOCl’. Among these genes: (i) ‘FGB’ is the (3
component of ﬁbrinogen, an important player in blood coagulation;
‘ITIH1’ is the heavy chain of a serine protease inhibitor involved
in the inﬂammatory response; ‘ANGPTL3’ is a member of the
angiopoietin-like family of secreted factors. Differential correlation
of these three edges (correlation with CRP is higher in omental tissue
than in liver, data not shown) are consistent with the fact that in the
omental adipose tissue, the large number of fat cells enhance the
interaction between CRP and the immune system. (ii) ‘CYP2C9’,
‘CYP4F2’ and ‘CYP2C8’ are involved in synthesis of cholesterol,

steroids and other lipids, whereas ‘ADH6’ and ‘SLCOlB 1’ ﬁinction
in the metabolism of many substrates including alcohol and lipids.
Differential correlations of these ﬁve edges (correlation with CRP
is positive in omental tissue yet negative in liver, data not shown)
are consistent with the fact that under the pathological condition of
morbid obesity, the liver is oversupplied with free fatty acid whereas
omental adipose tissue shows over-expression of lipid metabolism
genes. (iii) ‘APOC3’ and ‘APOCl’ are apolipoproteins thought
to delay catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles. Their correlation
with CRP is also negative in liver but positive in omental tissue,
contributing to the deregulation of lipid metabolism in liver of
obesity patients.

We also compared the topological difference of this sub-network
in liver versus omental tissues. After constructing the co-expression
network of the 31 genes (as detailed in the Section 2.7), we calculated
four representative topological measures. In order to achieve a fair
comparison, we randomly sampled 1000 sub-networks of size 31
and derived the null distribution of the four topological measures in
the liver as well as omental data. We then normalized the original
values using the mean and SD of the null distribution and the results
are shown in Table 4. It can be seen that the sub-network is denser
(higher mean connectivity, higher mean clustering coefﬁcient) in the
omental tissue than that in liver. The heterogeneity (a measure of
the variance of connectivity of each node) of this sub-network is not
signiﬁcant in either liver or omental tissues. The big difference in
centralization indicates that this co-expression sub-network is much
more like star topology in the omental tissue but not in the liver.

We explored the effect of different parameter settings on the
genetic algorithm using a new simulated dataset with real covariance
matrices extracted from the liver—omental data. We also showed
the reasonability of the proposed procedure for the ﬁnal choice of
A via calculation of adjusted score using this dataset; please see
‘Supplemental Material’ for details.

3.4 Extension to sub-network identiﬁcation across
multiple gene expression datasets

As both the F -statistic and ECF-statistic can measure DE and DC
across more than two conditions, COSINE can be easily applied
to multiple network comparisons. As an example here, we used
COSINE to identify the condition-speciﬁc sub-network across the
expression proﬁle of three HapMap sample populations: ASN,
CEUP and YRIP. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst between-
population study on the expression of genome wide association
studies (GWAS) genes using an integrated approach. In this analysis,
we set the mutation rate to 0.05, iteration number to 1000 and
ZeroToOne ratio to 5. The k-values used for random sampling to
derive the A quantiles are 100—150 by the interval of 5. The size
of the identiﬁed sub-network is 122, 164, 196, 178 and 198, for

the ﬁve As, respectively. The best and mean scores in each iteration
of the genetic algorithm are shown in Supplementary Figure S5.
There is a signiﬁcant overlap between the latter three sub-networks,
with 84 genes shared among them. We then looked at the sub-
network identiﬁed by A4, which gave rise to the highest adjusted
score (the number of random sampling to get the null distribution of
sub-network scores was set to 10 000). The results for the adjusted
sub-network scores are shown in Supplementary Table S1(c).
Functional annotation of the 178 genes indicates the enrichment
for many immune-related pathways, such as ‘Viral myocarditis’,
‘Type 1 diabetes mellitus’ and ‘Graft-versus-host disease’, as well
as several non-immune pathways including ‘Pathways in cancer’,
‘Oocyte meiosis’ and ‘MAPK signaling pathway’. For the detailed
annotation list, see Supplementary Table S7. The signiﬁcance of
immune-related pathways has been shown in a number of studies
on gene expression variation across different ethnic groups (Storey
et (11., 2007; Zhang et (11., 2008). We also compared the results of
COSINE with those of separate analysis of differential expression
or differential correlation. In this case, DE analysis fails to identify
several immune pathways that are known to show racial difference
[e.g. ‘Type 1 diabetes mellitus’ (Lorenzi et (11., 1985) and ‘chemokine
signaling pathway’ (Storey et (11., 2007)]; and for the identiﬁed
ones (e.g. ‘Viral myocarditis’), it assigns much larger P-values. The
pathways identiﬁed via DC analysis are almost exclusively immune
pathways. Since the racial/ethnic difference in the risk of lung
cancer (Haiman et (11., 2006) and PC (Wells et (11., 2010) has been
extensively studied and well recognized, this comparison shows that
COSINE has the advantage of identifying a more comprehensive
condition-speciﬁc sub-network than traditional approaches based on
single criterion, which is not surprising since the best parameter A
for this dataset is neither the minimum nor the maximum among the
ﬁve quantiles, indicating that a weighted combination of DE and DC
does a better job for the search of the most signiﬁcant sub-network.

3.5 Comparison with higher order topological
measure-based analysis

In order to compare COSINE with analysis based on non-local
network characteristics, we calculated ﬁve topological measures
for each of the 265 trait-associated gene networks (as described
in Section 2.4). For some traits, the associated genes collected
from the GWAS catalog were not covered by the probes of
the microarray platform, and thus were not included in the co-
expression network construction. After this ﬁltering, 189 traits
remained for the tissue data analysis and 150 traits for the
HapMap data. We then calculated the P-value of each topological
measure’s variance across different tissues and different populations,
respectively, as described in Section 2.7. For the HapMap data,
only a few trait networks showed signiﬁcant P-values (<0.05) of
the variance (six traits for mean clustering coefﬁcient, ﬁve traits
for centralization/density/heterogeneity/mean connectivity), thus
prohibiting a reasonable comparison. In contrast, the topological
metrics of many trait networks vary signiﬁcantly across tissues
(Supplementary Table S8). Among these, three traits, ‘Cholesterol,
total’, ‘LDL cholesterol’ and ‘Triglycerides’, exhibit signiﬁcant
variance for all the ﬁve topological metrics and have >15 associated
genes. Figure 3 shows the heatmap of the co-expression patterns.
It turns out that there is always an apparent co-expression cluster
in the omental tissue but not in the other two tissues. From a

biological point of view, these three traits are closely related to
obesity pathology, and their gene expression proﬁles are expected
to differ between liver and adipose tissues (Kim and Park, 2010).

The adjusted scores of the ﬁve sub-networks are shown in
Supplementary Table S1 (d), with the highest one given by A4,
although it is very close to that of A5. This again suggests that
although the major variation in the expression pattern across three
tissues is on the side of DC rather than DE, taking a weighted
combination of both aspects can identify a sub-network with better
discriminative performance. It also shows that COSINE is able to
recover not only the genes with signiﬁcant alternation in DE/DC,
but also the ones with higher order topological variations.

We then used COSINE to analyze the liver—omental—
subcutaneous data. The A quantiles are listed in Table 1, mutation
rate=0.05, iteration number: 1000, ZeroToOne ratio=7. We then
checked how many of the union of the three trait networks (48
genes) were recovered by COSINE. As shown in Table 5, the best
performance was achieved by A5(0.992547), which is expected
because the ﬁve topological metrics mainly reﬂect the gene—
gene correlation patterns rather than the variation of single gene
expression.

4 DISCUSSION

The advantages of COSINE include: (i) the scoring ﬁinction is a
weighted combination of both the node score and the edge score.
In this way, COSINE takes into account not only the alteration
in the expression level of individual genes, but also the variation
of gene—gene correlation, which is the building block of other
higher order topological metrics, so that it can better reﬂect the

integrative changes of a sub-network. (ii) COSINE uses the genetic
algorithm, which is efﬁcient for global optimization involving
binary variables. For practical use, we recommend using the default
parameter setting in the COSINE package. (iii) COSINE can be
easily applied to gene prioritization within the extracted sub-
network. (iv) COSINE naturally eases the issue of scoring over more
than two conditions, since both the F -statistic and the ECF-statistic
are deﬁned for multiple groups. In contrast, previous methods use
either P-value or signal-to-noise ratio to measure the differential
gene expression, which requires additional transformation when
scoring over multiple conditions (Idekers et (11 ., 2002) and thus may
lead to misinterpretation of the original information. (v) Distinct
from various clustering methods, the goal of COSINE is not to
assign each gene to a speciﬁc module. It aims at extracting the
most variable sub-networks which are of real biological interest.
(vi) COSINE uses a simple empirical procedure to select weight
parameter A, making it adaptive to the speciﬁc datasets being
analyzed.

An issue of note is the effect of gene positions in the binary
vector on the genetic algorithm. It has been reported that the
ordering of genes on the chromosome can affect the convergence
of the genetic algorithm (Sehitoglu and Ucoluk, 2003). In ﬁiture
studies, we would like to compare genetic algorithm with other
global optimization algorithms to perform more efﬁcient sub-graph
search. We also note that appropriate scoring ﬁinction is essential
for sub-network identiﬁcation. Apart from our proposed procedure
to select A, there have been numerous studies in the ﬁeld of network
alignment (Flannick et (11., 2009) as well as structural alignment
in biophysics (Zien et (11., 2000) on parameter optimization for an
objective function. Therefore, it would be interesting to test other
more sophisticated parameter learning algorithms in COSINE. Last
but not the least, COSINE can be easily applied to other types
of networks, such as PPI network and gene regulatory networks,
to search for altered gene interaction patterns in case—control
groups.

5 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have proposed a new method, COSINE, to
identify condition-speciﬁc sub-network across two or more gene
expression datasets. Different from previous methods, COSINE
coordinately considers single gene’s expression variation and gene-
pair’s differential correlation, in order to extract a globally optimal
sub-network which can maximize the across-group difference. We
have shown using both simulated and real datasets that COSINE
can successﬁilly identify biologically meaningful sub-networks that
exhibit signiﬁcant alterations across a set of phenotypes.

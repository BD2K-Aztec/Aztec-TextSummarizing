xz(t) analytically and substitute into the measurement equation.
The result

y1(t) = 63 62 exp(—61 t) - (exp(61 t) — 1)

shows that 63 and 62 are structurally non—identiﬁable. 61 and only
the product of 63 and 62 are structurally identiﬁable. Such redun—
dant parameterization can be detected directly for very simple
examples. For analysis of realistic models, one has to resort to
more sophisticated approaches.

We compared three current conceptually different approaches
for identiﬁability analysis using the model and data of Raia et al.
(2011) as case study. In particular, we compared the Differential
Algebra Identiﬁability of Systems (DAISY) approach proposed
by Saccomani et al. (2003), the Exact Arithmetic Rank (EAR)
approach implemented by Karlsson et al. (2012) and the Proﬁle
Likelihood (PL) approach proposed by Raue et al. (2009). The
results of all three approaches are in good agreement; however,
each approach has speciﬁc strength and weaknesses that will be
discussed.

2 METHODS

Approaches for identifiability analysis can be classified according to sev-
eral criteria. The main difference is between a priori versus data-based
type approaches. A priori approaches can be applied irrespective of which
input functions are used and before the availability of experimental data.
Data-based type approaches can be applied if actual experimental
data are available or can be simulated under reasonable assumptions.
Some a priori approaches allow to test global identiﬁability, a property
holding for all possible parameter values, i.e. independently of the
actual parameter value. Other approaches allow to test local identiﬁabil-
ity, holding around a point in the parameter space. Some data-based
approaches also allow for conclusions about practical non-identiﬁability
(Raue et al., 2009) that is caused by limited quality of experimental
data. The classiﬁcation of the three approaches investigated is shown in
Table 1.

2.1 DAISY approach

This approach implements a differential algebra algorithm to perform a
global parameter identifiability analysis for dynamic models described by
polynomial or rational equations (Bellu et al., 2007). The basic idea is that
of manipulating algebraic differential equations as polynomials depend-
ing also on derivatives of the variable. Ritt’s algorithm permits to elim-
inate the non-observed state variables x from the system of equations
and to ﬁnd the inputioutput relation of the system: a set of polynomial
differential equations involving only the variables u and y, thus
describing all inputwutput pairs satisfying (1) and (2). The inputi
output relation is linearly parameterized by certain algebraic functions
of the unknown parameters called the exhaustive summary, which can be

easily extracted. These functions lead to a system of algebraic non-
linear equations in the unknown 6. By applying a computer algebra al-
gorithm, i.e. the Buchberger algorithm, it is possible to check whether
there is one or multiple solutions and hence distinguish between global, or
local identiﬁability or non-identiﬁability of the original dynamic system.
An additional advantage of using this computer algebra tool is that
it does not require expertise on mathematical modeling by the
experimenter.

2.2 EAR approach

This approach is based on applying the inverse function theorem to the
system of algebraic equations relating higher order derivatives of the
output y with respect to time at the initial time with the initial state
and parameters (Pohjanpalo (1978). Using a differential algebra ap-
proach, an upper bound of the order of differentiation can be given,
resulting in a non-linear algebraic system of equations in the parameters.
The rank of the Jacobian matrix for this system of equations gives infor-
mation about its solvability, and in case of a rank-deﬁcient matrix, a
more detailed analysis of the Jacobian provides information about
which parameters are involved in relations rendering the system non-
identiﬁable. The EAR method provides means to efﬁciently compute
the generic rank of the Jacobian matrix to return a conclusive result if
the system is structurally identiﬁable. It considers local identiﬁability but
around a generic point, i.e. the computations are carried out for a
random specialization of the unknown parameters, and initial state to
integer values and a random input in terms of a truncated integer coef-
ﬁcient power series. Local structural identiﬁability is an almost every-
where property by deﬁnition, i.e. it holds everywhere apart from
possibly on a set of measure zero. The EAR approach is based on a
method for local algebraic observability (Sedoglavic, 2002). The EAR
analysis is implemented as a fully automatic Mathematica function.
The user simply inputs the equations and gets the answer. Based on the
EAR identifiability analysis, it is also possible to ﬁnd minimal sets of
outputs giving identiﬁability (Anguelova et al., 2012).

2.3 PL approach

This approach checks for non-identiﬁability by posing a parameter esti-
mation problem using real or simulated data. The central idea is that non-
identiﬁability manifests as a ﬂat manifold in the parameter space of the
estimation problem, e.g. the likelihood function. A proﬁle can be calcu-
lated for each parameter 6,» individually by repeated optimization of all
parameters {6j|Vj 75 i} for a series of ﬁxed values of the parameter 6,». A
ﬂat proﬁle indicates a structurally non-identiﬁable parameter. For detect-
ing structural non-identiﬁability, simulated data are sufﬁcient. In case
real experimental data are available, practical non-identiﬁability can
also be detected and conﬁdence intervals for the parameter estimates
can be calculated. The traces in parameter space that correspond to the
proﬁles can be used to analyze the reason for non-identiﬁability and point
to missing experimental information and interrelated parameters. It was
demonstrated in a study by Raue et al. (2010) that the approach facilitates
an iterative experimental design strategy and Kreutz et al. (2012)

extended the approach to detect non-observability of the dynamics dir-
ectly. The approach was applied to biological data in Bachmann et al.
(2011) and Becker et al. (2010).

2.4 Equations of benchmark model

In the following, we describe the equations of the IL13-Induced JAK/
STAT signaling model (Raia et al., 2011) that correspond to Equations
(1) and (2). These equations determine the structural identifiability of the
model parameters. The ODE system determining the time evolution of
the state variables is given by

561(1) = —91€1u1X1— 95X1+ 96X2
X20) 2 +95X1 — 96X2

563(1) = +9161 141 X1 — 92X3X7
564(1) = +92X3X7 — 93x4

565(1) = +93X4 — 94X5

X60) = -97X3X6/(1 + 913X14)—

—97X4X6/(l + 913X14) + 62 93X7
567(1) = +97X3X6/(1+ 913X14)+

568(1) = —99X8X7 + 62 910%

569(1) = +99X8X7 — 62 910%

5610(1) = +911X9

5611(1) = —91261 u1X11

5612(1) = +912€1 u1X11

5613(1) = +914X10/(915 + X10) — 916X13
5614(1) = +917X9

where x is the 14D state vector, the dot denotes the time derivative, ul is
an input functions and c132 are constants. The initial conditions of the
state variables are

x(0) = [13,623, 0,0,0,2.8, 0,165,0,0,0.34,0, 0,0] (4)

the values are given in units of molecules per cell (><1000). The set of
measurement equations is deﬁned by the following equation

le) = X1 +X3+X4

y2(l) = 918063 + X4 + X5 + X12)

ysU) = 919064 + X5)

y4(l) = 920X7

ysU) = 921X10 (5)
y6(t) = 922X14

y7(’) = X13

ysU) = X9-

The components x, u and c of Equation (3) and y of Equation (5) are
described in Table 2. The model Equations (375) contain 23 unknown
parameters 6 that are described in Table 3. They need to be determined
from the available measurements given in Equation (5).

3 RESULTS

We present results on the identiﬁability for the benchmark
model (Raia et al., 2011) using the three approaches described
in the Section 2: the Differential Algebra Identifiability of
Systems (DAISY) approach proposed by Bellu et al. (2007);
EAR approach implemented by Karlsson et al. (2012) and the
PL approach proposed by Raue et al. (2009). For the last
approach, we also use the original data of Raia et al. (2011).
The application of the three approaches for identiﬁability
analysis will be described in detail. In summary, all three
approaches consistently classify ﬁve parameters as structurally
non—identifiable: 611, 615, 617, 621, 622.

3.1 DAISY approach

The differential—algebra—based approach provides a direct check
of global identifiability of the above model, showing the non—
identiﬁability of some model parameters. The approach suggests
a reduction of the model to minimal form so that fundamental
system theoretic properties, such as accessibility, hold and the
model is more suitable for further mathematical investigations.
Thus, before checking model identiﬁability from the designed
experiment, it is convenient to check its minimality. In this
case, just by visual inspection, it is easy to see that some of the
14 model equations defining the model are redundant.

In particular, the equations for x6, X3, x11 are the same as those
for X7,X9,X12 with the opposite sign. For example, from the
eighth and ninth equations, one obtains X9 = —.>‘Cg. By integrat—
ing and using the known initial conditions, one arrives at
XX) 2 —X3 + 165, thus eliminating one differential equation.
Same procedure is followed for X7,X12. Finally, x14 can be ex—
pressed as x14 2 x10617/611, and the last equation is also redun—
dant. The model can then be rewritten in a simplified form
involving only 10 state variables. This is done not only for the
sake of mathematical simpliﬁcation, but also to satisfy some
important structural property, such as minimality and accessibil—
ity (Saccomani et al., 2003). This is important, because the
lack of minimality of the model may lead to spurious non—
identiﬁability results for some parameters that may not occur
in a minimal model. Also, if the model has two or more differ—
ential equations dependent on each other, as in this case, the
model would not be accessible, making more difﬁcult the iden—
tiﬁability check of the model from the given initial conditions.

One thus arrives at the following simpliﬁed 10D model:

561(1) 2 —91X1CI 141 — 95M + 9062
562(1) 2 95M — 9M2
X30) 2 6161 ulxl — 62X3(—X6 + 

X40) 2 62X3(—X6 +  — 63X4

X50) 2 93X4 — 94X5

566(1) = —97X3X6/(1 + 913X13)— (6)
97X4X6/(1 + 613-’613)+ 98 (—-’C6 + 2-8)C2

X30) 2 —69Xg(—X6 +  + 610(—Xg + 165)CZ

56100) = 911(—X8 + 165)

56110) = —912€1u1X11

5613(1) = X10914/(915 + X10) — 916X13

with the corresponding initial conditions given in Equation (4).

To check global identiﬁability of this simpliﬁed 10D model
with DAISY, the user has to write in the input file the ordered
list of the output and state variables, the list of the unknown
parameters, the model equations and the known initial condi—
tions. Later in the text, the results will be illustrated. For explan—
ations of the technical terms, one may consult Bellu et al. (2007).

DAISY automatically ranks the input, output, state variables
and their derivatives, starts the pseudodivision algorithm, i.e. the
Ritt algorithm, and calculates the characteristic set of the model.
This is a minimal set of differential polynomials, which provides
an equivalent description of the model. The subset made of the
first eight (i.e. the number of model outputs) differential polyno—
mials does not depend on the state variable x and provides the
so—called inputioutput relation of the model. In particular, these
involve higher derivatives of the input and output signals.

To speed up the algorithm, it may be advisable to add derivatives
of the actual output functions to the system equations. This is
legitimate, as Ritt algorithm is based on differentiation, besides
the usual algebraic operations.

After a suitable normalization, the inputioutput polynomials
can be rendered monic, and their coefﬁcients provide a set of
rational functions of the unknown parameter 6, which form the
so—called exhaustive summary of the model.

Identiﬁability is tested by checking injectivity of the exhaustive
summary with respect to the parameter 6. We should, in prin—
ciple, calculate the range set of these functions. This could be
done in symbolic language evaluating them at a symbolic par—
ameter value. In practice, but only to speed up the process, in—
stead of choosing a symbolic parameter value, we can use a set
of randomly chosen numerical points in the range set. Solution
of these algebraic equations is done by computing a Gr'obner
basis, by applying the Buchberger algorithm. The results show
that all the parameters are uniquely identiﬁable except for
611,615, 617,621 and 622, which have an inﬁnite number of solu—
tions. Thus, the model is non—identiﬁable.

The analysis actually provides some hint on how to simplify
the model to make it globally identiﬁable. For example, by as—
signing known values to parameters 621 and 622, the model would
become globally identiﬁable.

how to obtain it can be found at: http://www.dei.unipd.
it/wdyn/?IDsezione=4364.

3.2 EAR approach

The identiﬁability of a dynamic model is closely related to the
properties of the Jacobian matrix containing the derivatives of
signals assumed to be measured (i.e. model outputs) and their
time derivatives, with respect to the parameters. Furthermore,
structural identiﬁability is a generic property of the symbolic
form of the system and measurement equations, and hence it is
sufﬁcient to analyze this property for a specific (generic) point in
parameter space. In the EAR approach, this is utilized using
exact modular integer arithmetics for fast computations, i.e.
the specialization of parameter values to random integers only
serves the purpose of fast computation of structural properties
and has nothing to do with biological feasibility. The direct ap—
proach of first deriving the entries of the Jacobian matrix in
symbolic form, inserting integer values and then computing the
matrix rank is not feasible for anything but very small systems,
because of extensive swell of the size of symbolic expressions.
Instead, it can be shown that the numerical values of the entries
of the J acobian matrix can be computed efﬁciently by computing
power series solutions to the original ODEs augmented by their
corresponding parametric sensitivity differential equations, fol—
lowed by insertion into the output sensitivity expressions the
obtained truncated power series solutions of the state and state
sensitivities. To prevent the need for computation with rational
numbers and the inherent swell in size of numerators and de—
nominators, all computations are carried out modulo a large
prime. To summarize, the above approach is based on exact
(modular) arithmetics for obtaining the entries in the Jacobian
as well as for the subsequent rank computation; hence, the name
EAR. It is implemented in terms of a fully documented

Mathematica application and is completely automatic once a
speciﬁc system description has been provided.
Here is an outline of the steps of the algorithm

(1) Identiﬁability is a generic property of the symbolic form of
the system and measurement equations. Therefore, any
generic point can be analyzed. First, specializations of par—
ameters and initial conditions are generated.

(2) Specialize inputs to truncated random integer coefﬁcient
power series.

(3) Truncated power series solutions of x,  and  are com—
puted, using the system and sensitivity system equations.

(4) The power series are inserted in the expressions for the
derivatives of the outputs with respect to the initial state
and with respect to the parameters

(1 (l _ 8h 8x

dx(0)y :dx(0) ‘Eaam (7)
d d ahax ah
(Toy—(Te mom (8)

resulting in power series representations of the output sen—
sitivity derivatives.

(5

v

Identiﬁcation of the coefficients of the truncated power
series of the output derivatives with the coefficients of a
general Taylor expansion of the output sensitivity deriva—
tives gives the higher order time—derivatives of the output
sensitivity derivatives, i.e. the entries of the specialized
Jacobian matrix.

(6) Calculate the rank.

(7) If the matrix is rank—deﬁcient, the non—identiﬁable param—
eters are found using the fact that removing the corres—
ponding columns from the matrix do not change the rank.

The analysis using the Mathematica package is fully auto—
matic. Further information about the package and instructions
on how to obtain it can be found at: http://www.fcc.cha1mers.se/
sys/products/identifiabi1ityana1ysis.

Included in the package is, apart from the identiﬁability test
demonstrated above, also functionality for automatically finding
minimal sets of output expressions that guarantee a structurally
identiﬁable model. This functionality is described in Anguelova
et al. (2012).

3.3 PL approach

The PL approach determines the identiﬁability of the model par—
ameters by posing a parameter estimation problem. Here, we use the
original data of Raia et al. (201 1) and investigate both the structural
and practical identiﬁability of the model parameters. For parameter
estimation, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied. The
likelihood L(6) describes the probability of the data given certain
parameter values 6. The MLE ﬁt of the dynamic model to the ex—
perimental data for MedB—l cell is shown in Figure 1, and the MLE
parameter values are given in Table 3. Likelihood proﬁles were
calculated as described in Raue et al. (2009) by

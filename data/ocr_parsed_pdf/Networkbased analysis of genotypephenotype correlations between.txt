ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recent studies on human disease have revealed that ab-
errant interaction between proteins probably underlies a substantial
number of human genetic diseases. This suggests a need to investi-
gate disease inheritance mode using interaction, and based on which
to refresh our conceptual understanding of a series of properties re-
garding inheritance mode of human disease.

Results: We observed a strong correlation between the number of
protein interactions and the likelihood of a gene causing any dominant
diseases or multiple dominant diseases, whereas no correlation was
observed between protein interaction and the likelihood of a gene
causing recessive diseases. We found that dominant diseases are
more likely to be associated with disruption of important interactions.
These suggest inheritance mode should be understood using protein
interaction. We therefore reviewed the previous studies and refined an
interaction model of inheritance mode, and then confirmed that this
model is largely reasonable using new evidences. With these findings,
we found that the inheritance mode of human genetic diseases can be
predicted using protein interaction. By integrating the systems biology
perspectives with the classical disease genetics paradigm, our study
provides some new insights into genotype—phenotype correlations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Decades of research into human genetic diseases, revolutionized
by the application of innovative technologies including next-
generation sequencing and genome-wide association study, has
led to the accumulation of an impressive amount of diseaseigene
associations (Broeckel and Schork, 2004; Handel et al., 2013; Ku
et al., 2011). On the other hand, the rapid development of prote-
omic technologies provides an extensive protein interaction map
that improves our understanding of the complex genotype-
to-phenotype relationships among human diseases and their
associated genes (Rual et al., 2005; Stelzl et al., 2005). This pro-
vides an opportunity to reevaluate the traditional models about
human genetic diseases. An important molecular mechanism that

underlies genotype-to-phenotype relationship is the inheritance
modes, including either dominant mode that a single mutated
allele of relevant gene is enough to affect or recessive mode
that both mutated alleles are necessary. Although the rapid ac-
cumulation of diseaseigene associations and protein interaction
data promise to improve our understanding of the disease inher-
itance mode and how it interrelates to the human diseases at a
systems level, the incorporation of inheritance mode has been
rarely seen in recent large-scale studies.

Protein network-based study has been proven to be a valuable
strategy for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying
human diseases (Barabasi et al., 2011; Goh et al., 2007).
Recently, the network-perturbation model has been proposed
as an alternative molecular mechanism of human diseases
(Furlong, 2013; Muers, 2010; Walhout, 2009), arguing that the
inheritance mode should also be recognized at the network level.
In this model, failures in the connectivity of protein interaction
network (PIN) that alter the network topology underlie human
diseases. It was observed initially in Caenorhabditis elegans that
mutations of gene RbAp48 can cause the loss of a subset of
interactions while leaving the gene partially functional
(Walhout et al., 2000). Subsequently, a number of studies have
provided strong evidence that mutations causing speciﬁc loss of
interaction, not necessarily complete loss of gene product, fre-
quently occur in diseases (Schuster-Bockler and Bateman, 2008).
Many disorders, such as Charcot Marie Tooth disease,
Creutzfeldt Jacob disease and Alzheimer syndrome, were found
to be protein interaction-related diseases (Chiti and Dobson,
2006; Ross et al., 2005; Shy et al., 2004). Researchers also sug-
gested that aberrant protein interactions involving gene Htt may
contribute to the pathology of Huntington (Cattaneo et al., 2001;
Giorgini and Muchowski, 2005; Zhang et al., 2003). A recent
study demonstrated that in-frame Mendelian disease mutations
are highly enriched on protein interaction interfaces, suggesting
that protein interaction plays a role in the pathogenesis of a
substantial number of genetic diseases (Wang et al., 2012).

So far, the classical model of genotype-to-phenotype relation-
ship is gene-centric, assuming that a mutation causes complete
loss of a gene product (Muers, 2010). However, the network-
perturbation model suggests that, in principle, the understanding
of Mendelian inheritance should take into account of the inter-
action between two genes. To our knowledge, two recent studies
analyzed the connection between inheritance modes of human
genetic diseases and protein interactions (Schuster-Bockler and

Bateman, 2008; Zhong et al., 2009). Schuster-Bockler and
Bateman collected 119 known protein interaction-altering muta-
tions from scientiﬁc literatures and observed a signiﬁcant enrich-
ment of autosomal dominant (AD) mutations versus autosomal
recessive (AR) mutations. Zhong et al. found that AD disorders
are more frequently associated with in-frame mutations than AR
disorders, a mutation type that frequently leads to defective
protein interaction rather than complete gene loss. Given the
previous ﬁndings about the correlation between interaction
and inheritance mode, it is highly probable that protein network
properties can differentiate between different inheritance modes.
Here, by taking advantage of comprehensive protein interaction
data and a large number of Mendelian diseases with known
inheritance mode, we conducted a systematic study to show
the correlation between protein network and inheritance
modes, and reﬁned a likely interaction-based model to explain
the correlation.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Disease mutations, disease genes and inheritance
modes

We obtained inheritance modes, disorderigene associations and disease
mutations from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) data-
base (Hamosh et al., 2005) and M2SG database (Ji et al., 2013). A sche-
matic illustration for the data extraction and integration from OMIM
was provided in Supplementary Figure S]. First, the inheritance mode of
diseases was extracted from OMIM for 4409 disease entries. Diseases
with unclear inheritance and multiple inheritance modes were not
included. Then, the inheritance mode of mutations or disease genes was
determined by the inheritance mode of associated diseases: 1234 AD
genes were deﬁned if single mutated allele of the gene is enough to
affect disease phenotypes, and 1162 AR genes were deﬁned if both
mutated alleles of the gene are necessary to cause any disease phenotypes.
According to this deﬁnition, 181 AD genes also contain mutations caus-
ing AR disease. AD interactions and AR interactions in our manuscript
are referred to as interactions between AD genes and AR genes,
respectively.

All mutations and affected phenotypes were extracted independently
from OMIM (Supplementary Table Sl). Only mutations mapped into the
diseases in diseases were used. Inheritance mode of OMIM mutations and
M2SG mutations was determined by manually comparing their disease
names with OMIM disease entries. A mutation pair is the combination of
two disease mutations, and all possible combinations of mutations were
considered when analyzing the mutation pairs. Disease mutations were
divided into three classes: in-frarne mutations (including missense muta-
tions and small in-frame indels), out-frame mutations (including nonsense
mutations and frameshift indels) and other mutations (i.e. fusions).

Diseassgene associations were provided with inheritance in
Supplementary Table S2. To integrate different types of disease informa-
tion, 12 465 disease names were manually merged into 2463 diseases
based on their given names (Supplementary Table S3). Pleiotropic gene
was deﬁned if the gene was associated with multiple diseases based on our
classiﬁcation.

2.2 Protein interaction network

The human protein binary interactions were compiled from following
resources on June 2012: MINT (Licata et al., 2012); BioGRID (Chatr-
Aryamontri et al., 2013); IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012); DIP (Salwinski
et al., 2004); BIND (Isserlin et al., 2011); HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al.,
2009); iRerVeb 4.1 to integrate the interactions from innatedb, matrixdb

and mppi (Turner et al., 2010); four datasets from public publications
(Rual et al., 2005; Stelzl et al., 2005; Venkatesan et al., 2009; Yu et al.,
2011). Experimental methods used to generate the interaction were
checked to ﬁlter out the methods only detecting protein complexes.
Predicted interactions were not considered. Finally, we constructed a re-
liable PIN comprising 77 192 interactions between 12 869 human genes.

A total of 3347protein complexes were compiled from Corum database
release of February 2012 (Ruepp et al., 2010) and HPRD release 9
(Keshava Prasad et al., 2009).

Hub genes and bottleneck genes were deﬁned by top 20% genes sorted
by node degree and betweenness, respectively.

2.3 Structurally resolved protein interaction interfaces

The interfaces of protein interactions were structurally resolved by a
homology modeling approach, as described in the work of Wang et a].
(2012). Pfam (version 26.0), 3did (version ‘Apr_3_2011’) and inam data
(September 3, 2012) were used to identify the interfaces of two interacting
proteins (Kelley and Ideker, 2005; Yu et al., 2007). We are aware that a
rigorous analysis of the interaction interface in interacting proteins
should be done based on a full atom-level description of the complete
structure of protein complex. In the absence of this information and
knowing it is not a general rule, the interacting domains on the corres-
ponding interacting proteins were considered to be the interaction inter-
face of the interaction. In total, 6823 interacting domain pairs of 4438
individual domains were used. Protein domain information was taken
from UniProt and Pfam. To map disease mutations into protein domains,
we only considered mutations for which the codon information was avail-
able, and then identiﬁed protein domains using Pfam and UniProt from
the codon information, as described in the work of Park et a]. (2009).

2.4 Detecting network modules

A probabilistic modeling algorithm was used to capture the modules of
PIN (Kelley and Ideker, 2005). The algorithm uses a log-odds score to
assess the likelihood that a set of nodes is more densely interconnected
than expected by chance:

I—Ia,bEMIBIE(a, b)+(1 — ,5)(1 — 1501,17»
Ha,beMra,blE(0, b)+(1 — ra,b)(1 — 1501,17»

Where M is a putative module of proteins and E is a set of interactions
inside the module. I L(a,b) = 1 if there is an interaction between members
a and b and otherwise I L(a,b) = 0. For a densely interconnected module
M, members are expected to interact with each other with a high prob-
ability ,8, which is higher than the random probability rally/5 was set to 0.8
according to empirical study. ray}, was determined by estimating the prob-
ability of observing the same interaction in random networks. Signiﬁcant
modules were searched in PIN by a greedy search procedure, and were
estimated by performing 100 random trials in random networks gener-
ated by edge-swapping method.

 

OS = log

2.5 Network-based classiﬁcation

To test the performance of large-scale properties in determining the in-
heritance modes of disease genes, we used three direct topological proper-
ties as classiﬁcation features, including node degree, betweenness and the
fraction of interactors with particular inheritance modes. To measure the
diagnostic value of these features, we designed a RBF kernel-based sup-
port vector classiﬁer (SVM) to predict the inheritance modes, and then
used a 5-fold cross-validation strategy to evaluate the performance of
SVM classiﬁer. The outcome of prediction was then assessed by receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis. A benchmark dataset was selected
with two following criteria: (i) both genes in our PIN are AD or AR
disease genes; (ii) the associated diseases have at least two disease genes.

2.6 Tissue homogeneity

We used global gene expression data across 79 different human tissue
types from the GNF Atlas project (Su et al., 2004). The tissue-speciﬁcity
measure (SPM) of a gene x in a tissue 1' (xi, 1' e [1 ~79]) was detected by
solving a linear algebra problem of scalar projection (Xiao et al., 2010).
SPM ranges from 0 to l. A value (x,-) close to 1 indicates that the gene x is
mainly expressed in tissue 1'. Then, the tissue homogeneity between genes
was estimated by the Pearson correlation of SPM values across 79 tissues.
If the expression of the two genes was highly selective in several similar
tissues, the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient would be close to l, or other-
wise would be close to 0.

3 RESULTS
3.1 PIN and its association with AD diseases and AR
diseases

We ﬁrst calculated the likelihood of genes causing any AD dis-
ease as a function of increasing node degree in PIN. This likeli-
hood showed a dramatic increase for genes with a larger number
of protein interactions, whereas no signiﬁcant correlation was
found for AR disease genes (Fig. 1A). We then asked whether
the correlation between AD disease and network connectivity
was attributed to the fact that many AD diseases are associated

with genes encoding structural proteins and transcription factors,
which tend to have many protein interactions. We ruled out
this possibility by ﬁnding out that the trend holds even after
controlling for structural proteins or transcription factors
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

As a result, AD disease genes have signiﬁcantly higher node
degree than that of non-disease genes aVIanniWhitney U-test,
P = 1054). However, no signiﬁcant difference was found for
the node degree between AR disease genes and non-disease
genes aVIanniWhitney U-test, P = 0.86), indicating that AR dis-
ease genes have no tendency to encode hub genes or non-hub
genes. We asked whether the correlation was attributed to the
bias that AD genes are often well-known disease genes and
thus overrepresented in PIN dataset. We thus compared the cor-
relation between protein interaction and disease genes that are
associated with the dominant inheritance and recessive inherit-
ance of the same disease class. We found that, even for the
same disease classiﬁcation, the disease genes associated with a
dominant disease entry have signiﬁcantly higher node degree
than that of disease genes associated with a recessive disease
entry (sign test, P<0.001, Fig. 1B). For example, in mental re-
tardation and Parkinson disease (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig.
S3), all the top highly connected disease genes are associated with

a dominant disease entry, whereas the poorly connected disease
genes are generally associated with a recessive disease entry. These
results may help to address the recent debates about whether
disease genes tend to encode hubs in PINs (Furlong, 2013).

3.2 Gene pleiotropy and its association with AD diseases
and AR diseases

It has been suggested that PIN can serve as a framework to
understand the pleiotropy of human disease genes (Tyler et al.,
2009). We investigated this by separating disease genes of differ-
ent inheritance modes. We found that, whether for hub genes or
non-hub genes, the proportion of AD pleiotropic disease genes
was significantly higher than that of AR pleiotropic disease genes
(Fig. ID). We further observed that not only the proportion of
pleiotropic genes, but also the number of disorders that a pleio-
tropic AD disease gene associated with is signiﬁcantly higher
than that of a pleiotropic AR disease gene associated with
(ManniWhitney U-test, P = 1.4x 108). Some hub AD genes
such as COL2A1 and FGFR2 are associated with more than a
dozen of entirely different AD disorders. This result suggests that
AD genes are more likely to cause different diseases than AR
genes, probably because AD genes carry a larger number of
interactions.

More importantly, we found that the proportion of pleiotropic
genes in hub AD disease genes was significantly higher than the
proportion in non-hub AD disease genes; however, we did not
observe significant difference for AR disease genes (Fig. 1D).
Moreover, a signiﬁcant correlation was found between the aver-
age number of associated AD diseases and the node degree of
the AD disease genes (Pearson correlation r = 0.5, P< 0.01,
Fig. 1E), whereas no signiﬁcant correlation was found between
the average number of associated AR diseases and the node
degree of the AR disease genes. These results suggest that protein
interaction can be used as a molecular basis of pleiotropy for AD
disease genes, while it may not be appropriate for explaining the
pleiotropy for AR disease genes.

The pleiotropy analysis was based on our disease classiﬁca-
tion. To avoid the potential bias of our disease classiﬁcation, we
also tested these results using OMIM disease entry and an inde-
pendent disease classiﬁcation system based on HGMD muta-
tions, respectively, both of which show the same signiﬁcant
results (Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.3 AD Diseases are associated with the loss of important
interactions

Previous studies on human disease highlight the importance of
bottleneck genes that mediate the communication between func-
tional modules (Margadant and Sonnenberg, 2010; Shao et al.,
2012; Taylor et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2011), for which the node
degree might be small but with important protein interactions
whose loss disrupts the cross talk between modules. We therefore
investigated the association with bottleneck genes for different
disease inheritance modes. We deﬁned bottleneck genes using a
topological measure known as ‘betweenness’ (Taylor et al.,
2009). In the biological context, betweenness measures the
ways that signals pass though the network and is previously
used to deﬁne the bottleneck genes H u et al., 2007). In

Figure 2A, we show that bottleneck genes are more likely to
be associated with AD diseases, as opposed to AR diseases.
The correlation is signiﬁcant even after controlling for node
degree (analysis of covariance test, P = 0.037). We found that
non-hub bottleneck genes are more likely to be associated with
AD diseases than hub non-bottleneck genes, even though their
node degrees are dramatically lower than that of hub non-bottle-
neck genes (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that betweenness
centrality is another topological measure indicating the likeli-
hood of a gene being associated with AD diseases. To further
investigate this, we studied a comprehensive list of human pro-
tein complexes, a typical representative of modules that extracted
from widely used databases. We divided members of protein
complexes into bottleneck genes and non-bottleneck genes, and
found that bottleneck genes are signiﬁcantly more likely to be
AD disease genes than non-bottleneck genes in protein com-
plexes (Fig. 2B). However, there is no significant difference for
AR disease genes. We also used a probabilistic modeling algo-
rithm to capture the network modules (see Section 2), which
revealed 432 signiﬁcant modules. We examined the overlap be-
tween the 432 significant modules and found a signiﬁcant enrich-
ment of AD disease genes in the overlap of adjacent modules, as
compared with the probability of ﬁnding AD disease genes in
other positions (Fisher exact test, P<0.01). Figure 2C shows an
example of two overlapping modules, where two AD disease
genes are located at the interface. The results suggest that AD
diseases are more likely to associate with the disruption of im-
portant interactions. As an example, the AD disease infantile
Haemangioma is associated with mutations on gene FLT4, a
small node degree gene that mediates between several important
genes (Fig. 2D). Speciﬁcally, FLT4 contains Pkinase Tyr domain
that is responsible for the connection between hub genes GRB2,
KDR and SHCl, and I-set domain that is responsible for the
interaction with a non-hub gene VEGFC. Interestingly, in-frame
disease mutations are signiﬁcantly enriched on Pkinase_Tyr
domain, suggesting that loss of important interactions of this
gene might be associated with disease.

3.4 Understanding inheritance modes using protein
interaction

To explain the results, we tentatively proposed the model of AD
interaction and AR interaction as in Figure 3A, based on an
assumption that most disease mutations are loss-of-function, as
did in previous study (Zhong et al., 2009). This model refines the
conclusion of previous studies (Schuster-Bockler and Bateman,
2008; Zhong et al., 2009) and helps the user to illustrate that AD
genes are more likely to be associated with interaction-altering
than AR genes. For simplicity, we ideally modeled AD inter-
action when insufﬁciency of the interaction affects disease pheno-
types, and modeled AR interaction when complete loss of this
interaction affects disease phenotypes. Apparently, according to
the classical gene-centric model of inheritance mode, a disease
gene associated with an AD interaction is itself dominant. In the
case of AD interaction, mutations on single copy of either inter-
acting genes that render the interaction defective are able to
affect the phenotype. Conversely, in the case of AR interaction,
to cause the complete loss of the interaction, mutations on both
copies of the same interacting gene are necessary. Moreover,

those mutations should cause the complete gene loss, or else
mutations on both alleles should be on the same interaction
interface, which is less likely to happen. Therefore, given that
protein interaction underlies a substantial number of human
genetic diseases, one can expect that AR diseases are more fre-
quently associated with the complete gene loss than AD diseases.
This model is consistent with previous ﬁnding that interaction-
altering mutations are enriched of dominant mutations and the
ﬁnding that AD disorders are more frequently associated with in-
frame mutations than AR disorders (Schuster-Bockler and
Bateman, 2008; Zhong et al., 2009).

We did not have an appropriate dataset of mutations causing
loss of interaction to conﬁrm the model with more convincing
evidences. However, we studied genes and mutations that are
more likely to be associated with interaction-altering or gene
loss, and analyzed their predisposition to cause AD diseases
and AR diseases. Using OMIM data, we found that AR disease
genes were more likely to have out-frame mutations than AD
disease genes (600 versus 373 genes, X2 test, P = 2x10’10),

strengthening the idea that AR diseases are more frequently
associated with complete gene loss than AD disease genes. We
also plotted the ratio of the number of AR/the number of AD
genes as function of the minimal fraction of out-frame/in-frame
mutations (Fig. 3B), and found that the number of AR genes was
>4-fold higher than the number of AD genes if all the mutations
on the disease genes are out-frame. As an example, we collected
175 AR mutations and 103 AD mutations associated with dis-
ease ‘DEAFNESS’, and found that AR mutations are more
likely to be deleterious than AD mutations (21.1 versus 4.9%
out-frame mutations, P = 2 x 104, Fisher exact test).

We then ask whether AD disease genes are more likely to
contain protein domains involving in proteineprotein binding
than AR disease genes. For this purpose, we analyzed the
promiscuous domains that present in various combinations in
multi-domain proteins and participate in many different kinds
of protein interactions (Basu et al., 2008). We found a signiﬁ-
cantly higher frequency of ﬁnding a promiscuous domain in AD
disease genes than in AR disease genes (Sign test, P< 0.01). For

Fig. 3. Interaction model of inheritance. (A) The AD interaction and AR interaction. Dominant interaction is ideally deﬁned if the insufﬁciency of the
interaction has phenotype effect, and recessive interaction is deﬁned if the complete loss of the interaction has phenotype effect. The X mark means a
mutation on the interaction interface causing the loss of corresponding interaction. The model suggests AD interactions are easier to happen than AR
interaction. (B) The ratio of the number of AR genes versus the number of AD genes is plotted as minimal fraction of out-frame/in-frame mutations on a
gene. (C) Fraction of AD disease genes and AR disease genes with respect to the mutations on different interaction interfaces causing different diseases
and the same disease. (D) Percentage of mutation pairs of the same protein causing different diseases. Errors are calculated by bootstrapping based on
resampling. (E) Tissue homogeneity of protein interactions. Bars without (with) gridlines represent both genes of the interaction causing different diseases
(same disease). In cases of interactions between AD/AR genes, only interactions with mutations on corresponding interaction interfaces of interacting
proteins were considered. Asterisk represents statistical signiﬁcance (Mann7Whitney U-test, P< 0.05)

example, two promiscuous domains involving in proteineprotein
binding, PHD and PDZ, were found predominantly in AD dis-
ease genes. We also analyzed a list of genes with in-frame muta-
tions signiﬁcantly enriched on protein interaction interfaces
(Wang et al., 2012), and found that AD genes were signiﬁcantly
more enriched than AR genes in the list (Fisher exact test,
P = 7 x 1075). Then, we mapped disease mutations into the inter-
acting interfaces of the associated genes following the previous
studies (Das et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012). We found in total
134 genes having mutations on different interaction interfaces
causing different diseases, suggesting that different diseases are
probably associated with different interactions (Fig. 3C). Among
these genes, the proportion of AD disease genes was~2-fold
higher than that of AR disease genes (Fisher exact test,
P = 4 x 104). As a comparison, we analyzed 177 genes having
mutations on different interfaces causing the same disease.
Conversely, among the 177 genes, the proportion of AD disease
genes was only about half that of AR disease genes
(P = 3 x 104). We also found that, compared with mutations
on AR genes, mutation pairs on different interaction interfaces
of the same AD disease gene were much more likely to cause
different disorders than mutation pairs on different interaction
interfaces of the same AR disease gene (33% versus 19%,
Fig. 1C). This result suggests an interrelationship between the

interaction model and AD diseases, on account of different inter-
actions of the same gene associated with different diseases. To
increase the reliability of the results, we also analyzed the muta-
tion data in M2SG database (Ji et al., 2013), which includes
curated mutations from OMIM and SwissProt. Among 162
genes having mutations on different interaction interfaces caus-
ing different diseases, 84 genes were AD genes, while 50 genes
were AR genes (P = 0.01). As a comparison, among 168 genes
having mutations on different interfaces causing the same dis-
ease, only 47 were AD genes, while 81 were AR genes (P<0.01).
Mutation pairs on different interaction interfaces of the same
AD gene were much more likely to cause different disorders
compared with the mutation pairs on AR genes (17 versus
11%, P<0.01).

To investigate why some interacting genes cause different dis-
eases, we asked whether tissue-speciﬁc expression imposes strong
restriction for such interactions. Using global gene expression
across 79 human tissues (see Section 2), we found that interacting
genes causing the same disease share higher tissue homogeneity
than interacting genes causing different diseases (Fig. 3E). We
also found AD gene interactions and AR gene interactions for
which both interacting genes have mutations on the same inter-
action interface and affecting the same disease have higher tissue
homogeneity than interactions for which both interacting genes

Fig. 4. Schematic illustration of AD/AR genes. (A) Schematic illustration of AD/AR genes with multiple interactions. Protein interaction can be used as
a molecular basis to understand the correlation between network connectivity and AD disease, and the pleiotropy of AD disease genes, whereas it is not
appropriate for explaining the pleiotropy for AR disease genes. (B) Schematic diagram of the differences between AD and AR disease genes. AD disease
genes are shown as orange nodes, located in functional center of PIN as hubs, core members and bottlenecks of modules, whereas AR disease genes are

have mutations on the same interaction interface but affecting
different diseases. As can be seen, tissue-speciﬁc expression im-
poses strong restriction for interactions. We also found that AR
gene interactions have signiﬁcantly higher tissue homogeneity
than AD gene interactions.

In conclusion, the model suggests that protein interaction can
be used as a molecular basis to understand the correlation be-
tween network connectivity and AD disease, and the pleiotropy
of AD disease genes (Schematic illustration in Fig. 4A). This
would give rise to a striking difference regarding the network
position of AD versus AR genes (Fig. 4B). Generally, AD dis-
ease genes are located in functional center of PIN as hubs, core
members and bottlenecks of modules, whereas AR disease genes
are segregated at the periphery of PIN, resulting in large network
distances from other AR disease genes associated with different
diseases.

3.5 Network-based prediction of inheritance modes

Identifying inheritance modes traditionally depends on detailed
pedigree information (Seton-Rogers, 2007). However, more and
more in silico methods have been developed to predict new dis-
easeegene associations (Ideker and Sharan, 2008), for which the
pedigree data are usually unavailable. The topological features
that differentiate AD diseases from AR diseases may help ad-
dress this challenge. We thus evaluated such topological features
and used SVM learning. A 5-fold cross-validation strategy was
applied on those diseaseegene associations with clear inheritance
modes and with associated genes mapping into our PIN. The
cross-validation process revealed a typical area under the curve
of 0.85 and speciﬁcity, sensitivity, accuracy of 94, 63 and 84%,
respectively, in predicting inheritance modes for diseaseegene

associations. This result can be used to assist the identiﬁcation
of inheritance modes. A typical example is sudden infant death
(SID, OMIM: 272120). Evidence has been presented for the
Mendelian association between SID and mutations on SCN5A
(Weese-Mayer et al., 2007). However, the inheritance mode of
this association is unclear. We found that SCN5A is a hub gene
and a bottleneck gene interacting with an AD gene ALB in our
protein network, and also is a member of protein complex
(HPRD: com_2971) that is signiﬁcantly enriched by AD genes.
We predicted the inheritance mode of SID-SCN5A association
to be dominant. It has been known that mutations on SCN5A
cause a series of heart diseases known as AD, including atrial
ﬁbrillation, brugada syndrome, cardiomyopathy, long QT syn-
drome and heart block.

4 DISCUSSION

Unlike non-pathological variations and out-frame disease muta-
tions, it has been found recently that in-frame disease mutations
are signiﬁcantly enriched on interactions interfaces (Wang et al.,
2012). The in-frame mutations were suggested more likely to
alter protein interaction and were found to be able to distinguish
between AD and AR disorders (Zhong et al., 2009). These sug-
gest protein network can provide novel insights into genotypee
phenotype correlations between different inheritance modes. We
therefore analyzed a series of network properties between AD
and AR inheritances and found (i) network connectivity strongly
correlated with the likelihood of a gene causing AD diseases
(disease risk) and the ability of a gene causing multiple AD dis-
eases (pleiotropy); (ii) AD diseases are more likely to be asso-
ciated with the bottleneck genes, whereas no signiﬁcant

correlation was found for AR diseases. To explain the results, we
reﬁned a model based on previous studies and supported with
more evidence.

It was argued that network-based study may improve our
conceptual understanding of the term pleiotropy on account of
diverse disorders that result from losing different interactions of
the same gene (Chavali et at, 2010; Tyler et at, 2009). However,
our study suggests that the pleiotropy of AR disease genes
should be treated differently from AD disease genes. In addition
to gene pleiotropy, the clinical features may show striking vari-
ation among patients for the same dominant disorder, and in
some cases, show no abnormal clinical features (Cohn et at,
2007; Milewicz et at, 1998). We expect that, with further system-
atic investigations of the relationship between human AD dis-
orders and gene networks, this variable expressivity and reduced
penetrance of dominant diseases, together with the pleiotropy
would be better understood. Pleiotropy is also one of the reasons
that multiple diseases co-occur in the same patient. Many comor-
bid disease pairs have been shown to share the same pleiotropic
gene (Park et at, 2009). Therefore, our study may also suggest
different comorbid tendencies between AD disease pairs and AR
disease pairs.

Because topological central genes are more essential than other
genes, our results may suggest that mutations on AD genes are
more likely to cause severe impairment of cell function than mu-
tations on AR genes. In our study, the proportion of AD genes
having mouse lethal orthologs are signiﬁcantly higher than that
of AR genes (x2 test, P<0.01). The connection with important
interaction may be one of the reasons why non-lethal dominant
mutations are sometimes found to cause embryonic lethality
when homozygous.

The results would be more consistent with the model by ana-
lyzing only loss-of—function mutations. For this purpose, we
compiled 302 genes known to cause disease through haploinsuf-
ﬁciency (HI) from previous studies (Dang et at, 2008; Seidman
and Seidman, 2002). Similar results were reproduced by analyz-
ing HI genes (Supplementary Fig. S6). Signiﬁcantly different net-
work properties were found between HI genes and AR genes,
whereas no signiﬁcantly different properties were found between
HI genes and other AD genes.

A recent study has also investigated the relationship between
dominant and recessive mutations in interfaces with the same or
different disorders (Shao et at, 2012). Different with this study,
we only analyzed mutation pairs in the same gene because of the
small number of interactions being mapped by mutations on the
corresponding interfaces of interacting proteins. The study pre-
sented some different results and suggested that AD mutation
pairs on corresponding interaction interfaces of interacting pro-
teins are not likely to cause the same disease. We suggest that, it
is possibly due to the fact that tissue-speciﬁc expression imposes
spatial restriction on these interactions.

Gain-of—function mutations and dominant negative mutations
are also important mechanisms of dominant diseases, for which
the data are not currently available at a large scale. It is possible
that some mutations on AD genes are associated with the gain of
new interactions or that some dominant mutations give rise to
altered gene product blocking the interaction of wild-type gene
product. Revised model taking into account of multiple mutation
types would be necessary in the future study. In addition, Disease

progression is also associated with mutations causing the change
of other molecular interaction types such as in transcriptional
networks or metabolic networks. Integration of different types
of molecular interactions should further improve our under-
standing of the inheritance modes of genetic diseases. We believe
that, as more large-scale data of diverse molecular interactions
and more speciﬁc disease mutations are detected, our knowledge
of the genotypeephenotype relationship will be highly expanded,
to which we hope our study made a contribution.

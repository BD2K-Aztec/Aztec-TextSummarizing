ABSTRACT

Motivation: Computational prediction of signal peptides is of great
importance in computational biology. In addition to the general
secretory pathway (Sec), Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts possess
another major pathway that utilizes the Twin-Arginine translocase
(Tat), which recognizes longer and less hydrophobic signal peptides
carrying a distinctive pattern of two consecutive Arginines (RR) in
the n-region. A major functional differentiation between the Sec and
Tat export pathways lies in the fact that the former translocates
secreted proteins unfolded through a protein-conducting channel,
whereas the latter translocates completely folded proteins using an
unknown mechanism. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel
method for predicting and discriminating Sec from Tat signal peptides
at better accuracy.

Results: We report the development of a novel method, PRED-
TAT, which is capable of discriminating Sec from Tat signal peptides
and predicting their cleavage sites. The method is based on
Hidden Markov Models and possesses a modular architecture
suitable for both Sec and Tat signal peptides. On an independent
test set of experimentally verified Tat signal peptides, PRED-TAT
clearly outperforms the previously proposed methods TatP and
TATFIND, whereas, when evaluated as a Sec signal peptide predictor
compares favorably to top-scoring predictors such as SignalP and
Phobius. The method is freely available for academic users at

1 INTRODUCTION

In all domains of life (Bacteria, Eukarya and Archaea), the majority
of secreted proteins are synthesized as precursors that carry a
cleavable N-terminal signal sequence. The signal peptide possesses
a modular architecture with a positively charged region at the
n-terminus (n-region), a hydrophobic region (h-region) that spans
the membrane and a c-region of mostly small and uncharged
residues ending at the characteristic Cleavage site (von Heijne,
1990). The signal peptide is necessary for targeting the protein to

the membrane-embedded export machinery in Bacteria (Driessen
and Nouwen, 2007), Eukaryotes (Rapoport et (11., 1999) and
Archaea (Pohlschroder et (11., 2005). Upon translocation across the
membrane, the signal peptide is cleaved from the precursor via a
membrane-bound signal peptidase (Tuteja, 2005; van Roosmalen
et (11., 2004). In Eukaryotes, proteins targeted to the organelles
of bacterial origin (mitochondria and chloroplasts) also contain
cleavable N-terminal targeting sequences, although they are in
general different from those found in the eukaryotic or bacterial
secreted proteins (Habib et (11., 2007; von Heijne et (11., 1989).

In addition to the general export pathway (Sec), Bacteria, Archaea
and chloroplasts possess another major pathway that utilizes the
Twin-Arginine translocase (Tat). Tat recognizes longer and less
hydrophobic signal peptides carrying a distinctive pattern of two
consecutive Arginines (RR) in the n-region (Berks et (11., 2005;
Lee et (11., 2006; Teter and Klionsky, 1999). A major functional
differentiation between See and Tat export pathways lies in
the fact that the former translocates secreted proteins unfolded
through a protein-conducting channel, whereas the latter translocates
completely folded proteins using an unknown mechanism (Teter
and Klionsky, 1999). Interestingly, in halophilic Archaea, the
components of the Tat pathway are essential for viability (Dilks
et (11., 2005; Thomas and Bolhuis, 2006) and there is evidence that
Tat-dependent translocation is widely used as part of a mechanism
for adaptation to extreme saline environments (Rose et (11., 2002).

Computational prediction of signal peptides was performed
initially using weight matrices (von Heij ne, 1986). However, Neural
Networks (NNs) (Nielsen et (11., 1997, 1999) as well as Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs; Nielsen and Krogh, 1998) introduced by
the SignalP method have been proven to be the most successful
methods currently available (Menne et (11., 2000). Recently, SignalP
was retrained and, mainly due to better annotation and selection of
the training set, yielded an even better accuracy (Bendtsen et (11.,
2004). The Phobius (Kall et (11., 2004, 2007) and Philius (Reynolds
et (11., 2008) methods followed a different approach in which a
graphical model (HMM and Bayesian network, respectively) was
used to predict at the same time the presence of a secretory signal
peptide and transmembrane (TM) topology of a given protein
minimizing thus the number of signal peptides predicted as TM
segments and vice versa. Other methods such as LipoP (Juncker
et (11., 2003) and PRED-LIPO (Bagos et (11., 2008) were developed
during the last years for predicting lipoprotein signal peptides, which
possess a distinctive Cleavage site with an indispensable cysteine
responsible for anchoring to the membrane (Sankaran and Wu, 1994;

Sankaran et (11., 1995) and discriminate them from secretory signal
pepﬁdes

Although most of the methods mentioned so far are capable, up
to a certain degree, of predicting the Tat signal peptides, only a
few attempts were made toward predicting speciﬁcally this class
of proteins. TATFIND was presented initially combining regular
expression patterns and hydrophobicity analysis (Rose et (11., 2002),
whereas few years later, TatP was presented using a combination of
regular expression patterns and NNs (Bendtsen et (11., 2005). TatP has
been shown to be more reliable, whereas TATFIND is not capable
of predicting the Cleavage site but only recognizes the existence
of the n- and h-region. Another problem is that these methods are
not trained to discriminate at the same time Tat from See signal
peptides and thus, there is a need for combining these predictors
with a generic signal peptide predictor such as SignalP. In this
work, we present a novel method, FRED-TAT, based on HMMs,
which is capable of predicting and discriminating Tat and Sec signal
peptides. We show that this new method is more accurate than the
previously developed methods and additionally, compares favorably
to the top-scoring methods for the prediction of Sec signal peptides.
The prediction method is available for non-commercial users at
http://www.compgen.org/tools/PRED-TAT/ and we expect it to be
useful to both experimentalists and bioinformaticians.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets

The dataset that we used for training contained 150 Tat signal peptides
(119 from Gram-negative bacteria and 31 from Gram-positive ones), 328
secreted proteins containing a Sec signal peptide (216 from Gram-negative
bacteria and 112 from Gram-positive ones), 288 cytoplasmic proteins (183
from Gram-negative bacteria and 105 from Gram-positive ones) and 140
sequences (segments of TM proteins) with a TM segment that have their
N-terminus located to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (90 from Gram-
negative bacteria and 50 from Gram-positive ones). The Tat signal peptides
were collected from the Uniprot database (Wu et (11., 2006). Since there were
only few proteins with an experimentally veriﬁed Tat signal peptide (i.e. with
the ‘Tat-type signal peptide” identiﬁer in the FT ﬁeld), we decided to also
include proteins with putative or potential Tat signal peptides. The initial
dataset was submitted to redundancy reduction following the procedures
used in SignalP papers (Nielsen at (11., 1997, 1999) using the algorithm of
Hobohm (Hobohm at (11., 1992). We used a similarity threshold determined
at 20 identical residues within the signal sequence after a BLAST alignment
(Altschul at (11., 1997). After careful checking, we removed from the set
some proteins that could potentially contain a lipoprotein Tat signal peptide.
The Sec signal peptides, the cytoplasmic and the membrane proteins were
collected as described previously in the development of PRED-LIPO (Bagos
at (11., 2008) and CW-PRED (Litou at (11., 2008) with two major differences.
First, since PRED-LIPO and CW-PRED were trained on Gram-positive
bacteria, we repeated the same procedure in order to include additional
proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. Secondly, we removed from the Sec
signal peptide dataset proteins that were exported by the Tat pathway (as
judged by the annotation in Uniprot). In short, Sec signal peptides were
extracted from the training set of SignalPV2 (Nielsen at (11., 1997, 1999),
cytoplasmic proteins from the set of Menne (Menne at (11., 2000) and TM
proteins from various previously presented well-annotated datasets (Chen
and Rost, 2002; Ikeda et (11., 2003; Jayasinghe at (11., 2001; Moller et (11.,
2000). All proteins were of bacterial origin (Gram positive or Gram negative)
and we deliberately excluded archaeal sequences since the number of proteins
with experimentally veriﬁed signal peptide cleavage site is very small (Bagos
at (11., 2009).

In order to have an independent test set for evaluating the method and
compare it against the other available ones, we performed an extensive
search in the recent literature. We identiﬁed experimentally veriﬁed Tat
signal peptides originating from Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteria and
Archaea. Proteins that were already present in the training set (i.e. those
that already had an identiﬁer indicating that were Tat substrates) were
subsequently removed from the test set. By this way, for the majority of Tat
signal peptides in the test set, the precise location of the cleavage site was
not known. Some potential lipoproteins as well as several anchored proteins
(Aldridge 21111., 2008; Bachmann at (11., 2006; Hatzixanthis at (11., 2003) were
removed. Moreover, some wrongly annotated translation initiation sites that
were discovered during the literature search, such as Q3L8N0 (Yikmis at (11.,
2008), were reported to the Uniprot database. From UniProt, following the
procedure of Menne and coworkers (Menne at (11., 2000) we also collected
proteins having an experimentally veriﬁed Sec signal peptide from bacteria.
We then removed proteins that were already present in the set of SignalPV2
(which we used for training). Proteins carrying a Sec as well as a Tat signal
peptide were submitted once again to redundancy reduction, ensuring also
that no similarity with proteins of the training set was present. Finally, in
the test set of Tat signal peptides remained 75 sequences, including 18
sequences from Gram-negative bacteria, 45 from Gram-positive bacteria
and 12 from Archaea (Supplementary Table 1). In the test set of Sec signal
peptides remained 273 sequences (193 from Gram-negative bacteria and 80
from Gram-positive ones). We also retrieved bacterial cytoplasmic proteins
from UniProt by searching the ‘Subcellular Localization” ﬁeld and excluding
entries marked as ‘Potential’, ‘Putative’ and ‘By Similarity”. Given that
the number of sequences was large, these were submitted to redundancy
reduction using full sequences (30% identities in an alignment of at least
80 residues) and once again we removed proteins present (or having a
homologue) in the training set, leaving us with 601 proteins (407 from Gram-
negative bacteria and 194 from Gram-positive ones). Finally, in order to test
our method on TM proteins, we used the experimentally veriﬁed cytoplasmic
membrane proteins from bacteria used for the development of the PSORTB
method (Gardy 21111., 2005). From this set, we removed proteins present in the
training set, proteins with a putative signal peptide (based on the annotation)
and we performed redundancy reduction at 30% identical residues in an
alignment of at least 80 residues, leaving ﬁnally 192 TM segments (136
from Gram-negative bacteria and 56 from Gram-positive ones).

We also evaluated the HMMs, against the training and test sets used by
the developers of TatP. Finally, by searching the literature we identiﬁed
some additional proteins with signal peptides possessing the RR motif in
the n-region, but which have been experimentally veriﬁed as not being
Tat substrates (Palmer et (11., 2005; Widdick at (11., 2006, 2008). These
proteins were used as an additional carefully selected negative test set
for assessing the speciﬁcity of the methods developed here. The datasets
compiled in this work are available at http://www.compgen.org/tools/PRED-
TAT/supplement/datasets/.

2.2 HMMs

The HMM that we used has a modular architecture quite similar to the ones
previously used by PRED-LIPO, CW-PRED and PRED-SIGNAL. It consists
of four different sub-models, the Tat sub-model, corresponding to the signal
peptides translocated by Tat, the Sec signal peptide sub-model corresponding
to the Sec signal peptides, the N-terminal TM sub-model corresponding to
the N-terminal TM domain and a globular sub-model used to model the
globular N-terminal domains of cytoplasmic or membrane proteins. The
novel feature of our method is the Tat sub-model (Fig. 1) that was especially
designed to capture the sequence features of Tat signal peptides. It contains
states modeling the N-terminal n-region, the RR region, the hydrophobic
h-region and the cleavage site (c-region). In order to avoid overﬁtting, we
used the same emission probabilities for the n-region and, for all but the
last two residues of the h-region. The allowed transition probabilities were
set in order to model as closely as possible the sequence features of the
Tat substrates. The Sec signal peptide model is identical to the one used

Combined prediction of Tat and Sec signal peptides

share the same emission probabilities are depicted with the same shading and

with arrows.

before (Bagos at 611., 2008, 2009) and in many respects resembles the SignalP
models. Moreover, the emission probabilities for the cleavage site were tied
to the ones used for the cleavage site of Tat substrates. The TM sub-model,
is identical to the one used by the HMM-TM predictor for alpha-helical
membrane proteins (Bagos at 611., 2006), whereas the globular sub-model
consists simply of a self-transitioning state. The total number of the model”s
states is 142 (including begin and end states) with 240 freely estimated
transitions. On the other hand, the total number of freely estimated emission
probabilities is 551 (29 X 19), yielding a total number of 791 freely estimated
parameters.

The model was trained using the Baum7Welch algorithm for labeled
sequences (Krogh, 1994) and the decoding was performed using the standard
Viterbi algorithm (Durbin at 611., 1998). In addition to the Viterbi decoding
that produces the optimal path of states through the model, and hence predicts
simultaneously the type of the sequence as well as the cleavage sites (if any),
we report also the S1 reliability index (Melen 21111., 2003) which takes values
within the range of (L1 and it is a measure of the reliability of the prediction,
useful in a lot of situations.

The reported results correspond to a 30-fold cross-validation procedure,
where each set contains an equally balanced number of Tat signal peptides,
Sec signal peptides, TM and globular proteins. The training procedure
consists of removing 1 of the 30 subsets from the training set, training the
model with the remaining proteins and performing the test on the proteins of
the set that was removed. This process is tandemly repeated for all subsets in
the training set, and the ﬁnal prediction accuracy summarizes the outcome of
all independent tests. For measures of accuracy in each binary classiﬁcation
problem (Tat substrates versus non-Tat substrates, signal peptides versus
non-signal peptides), we used the percentage of correctly classiﬁed positive
examples (sensitivity), the percentage of correctly classiﬁed negative
examples (speciﬁcity) and the Mathews Correlation coefﬁcient (MCC) that
summarizes in a single measure true postitives (TP), false positives (FP),
true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) (Baldi at 611., 2000).

We also created two proﬁle Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) using the
HMMER 2.3.2 package (Eddy, 1998). The pHMM is a special case of HMM
and can be seen also as an extension of sequence proﬁles. It uses a HMM to
model, in a statistical manner, a multiple alignment of related sequences. The
pHMM, in contrast to the classical HMM described above, uses position-
speciﬁc parameters (emission and transition probabilities) and, in general,
has a larger number of freely estimable parameters. It is well-suited for

modeling protein families, but we used it here, since it has been shown
that under certain circumstances, it can also be used to model the sequence
features of signal peptides (Zhang and Henzel, 2004; Zhang and Wood,
2003). Initially, we created the multiple alignments as advised previously
for eukaryotic proteins (Zhang and Henzel, 2004; Zhang and Wood, 2003)
with minor manual interventions to handle the longer n-regions of Tat signal
peptides. We then built the pHMMs using the hmmbuild command of the
HMMER package and we performed searches using the hmmpfam command
of the same package. The multiple alignments and the HMMs are available
at http://www.compgen.org/tools/PRED-TAT/.

2.3 Comparison to other prediction methods

For comparison, we used mainly the TatP (Bendtsen at 611., 2005)
and TATFIND (Rose at 611., 2002) methods, which are until now the
only available predictors concerning Tat signal peptides. TatP is based
on a combination of regular expression patterns and NNs and it is
available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TatP/. TATFIND, on the other
hand, is based on a combination of regular expression patterns and
hydrophobicity analysis (Rose at 611., 2002) and it is available online
at http://signalﬁnd.org/tatﬁnd.html. We also evaluated two proﬁle HMMs
especially designed to recognize Tat signal peptides, which are deposited
in public databases: the PF10518 proﬁle of the PFAM database (Finn at 611.,
2006) and the TIGR01409 proﬁle of the TIGR database (Haft at 611., 2003). In
all cases (as well as when running the methods developed in this work), we
used the sequences truncated to their ﬁrst 100 residues. The proﬁle HMMs
were run using the trusted cutoffs reported in the respective databases.

For analyses concerning the accuracy in predicting Sec signal peptides, we
used SignalPV3 (Bendtsen at 611., 2004), Phobius (Kall at 611., 2004), Philius
(Reynolds at 611., 2008), RPSP (Plewczynski at 611., 2008) and PrediSi (Hiller
at 611., 2004). Concerning SignalPV3, we used both the NN and the HMM
modules. For methods that use different parameters for Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria (SignalP. PrediSi) we used the appropriate predictor
for each test sequence. In all cases we used the default parameters, with the
submitted sequences truncated to their ﬁrst 70 residues.

3 RESULTS

The detailed results obtained from the HMM method (FRED-TAT)
on the 30-fold cross-validation procedure are presented in the form
of a confusion matrix in Supplementary Table 1A, whereas those
concerning the independent test set in Supplementary Table 1B.

In the cross-validation, the model performs very well correctly
classifying the 148 out of the 150 Tat signal peptides (98.67%)
and predicts falsely only 9 Tat substrates (1.25%, all are actually
Sec signal peptides), yielding this way an MCC equal to 0.96
(Table 1). FRED-TAT in the cross-validation clearly outperforms the
other available methods (TatP, TATFIND and the proﬁle HMMs),
being equally speciﬁc but far more sensitive even though the results
obtained for these methods are not cross-validated (i.e. some of the
proteins tested were previously used for training these methods).
TATFIND seems to perform better compared to TatP, a fact mainly
caused by TatP”s lower speciﬁcity in excluding Sec signal peptides.
Interestingly, the proﬁle HMM that we created using HMMER
(PRED-TATHMMER) outperforms both the other proﬁle HMMs
as well as TATFIND and TatP, being almost equally good to the
custom HMM (FRED-TAT). Concerning the Sec signal peptides,
FRED-TAT also produces satisfactory results predicting correctly
the presence of a signal peptide in 315 out of the 328 proteins
(96.04%) and excludes non-signal peptides with a rate of 92.29%,
giving an overall MCC of 0.88 (Table 3). These results compare
favorably to those obtained by the other methods trained speciﬁcally

The test set contains no similar sequences to those included in the training set (see
Section 2). The MCC is computed by comparing Tat signal peptides versus non-Tat
sequences (Sec signal peptides, cytoplasmic and TM sequences).

for the prediction of Sec signal peptides. In particular, FRED-TAT
slightly outperforms RPSP and PrediSi, whereas is surpassed by
Signava3, Philius and Phobius. Nevertheless, as it is apparent from
Table 2, all these predictors perform comparably yielding MCCs in
the range of 0.87—0.93. Moreover, we should emphasize that the
results of the other predictors are not cross-validated.

On the independent test set (Table 3), FRED-TAT continues to
perform better than TatP and TATFIND, classifying correctly 71
out of the 75 Tat sequences (with a sensitivity equal to 94.67%).
Concerning the speciﬁcity of the method in detecting Tat signal
peptides, FRED-TAT produces approximately equal number of false
positive ﬁndings (compared with TatP and TATFIND) among the
secreted, TM and cytoplasmic proteins yielding thus an MCC
that is equal to 0.89. PRED-TATHMMER once again performs
comparable to FRED-TAT. TATFIND performs better compared
with TatP, since the latter fails to discriminate a larger number
of Sec signal peptides. Similar results are obtained when we test
all the methods in the sets used for training TatP (Supplementary
Tables). As expected, the overall accuracy of TatP is increased

(96.95%) (95.14%) (94.29%)

 

The results concerning FRED-TAT were obtained from the 30-fold cross-validation
procedure as described in Section 2. The training set includes a signiﬁcant portion of
sequences used to train the remaining predictors. The set does not include Tat signal
peptides and in such case, the speciﬁcity of the Sec signal peptide predictors would
be lower. The MCC is computed by comparing Sec signal peptides versus non-Sec
sequences (cytoplasmic and TM sequences).

(MCC = 0.89) in this set, but FRED-TAT is still more accurate
yielding an MCC of 0.94 (PRED-TATHMMER performs slightly
better). Lastly, the methods for predicting Tat signal peptides were
evaluated against the dataset of proteins carrying an RR motif but
which have been experimentally veriﬁed not to be Tat substrates.
In this set, the proﬁle HMMs and TATFIND are found to be more
speciﬁc, but nevertheless, FRED-TAT correctly excludes 86.64%
of the sequences and PRED-TATHMMER 84.1%, whereas TatP
excludes only 50% (Supplementary Table 6). Two similar datasets,
even though not experimentally veriﬁed, were compiled by the
authors of TatP and on these, FRED-TAT excludes 1291 out of
the 1336 proteins (96.63%), PRED-TATHMMER excludes 1295
(96.93%), whereas TATFIND excludes 1299 (97.23%) and TatP
1289 (96.48%).

Concerning the classiﬁcation of proteins bearing a Sec signal
peptide, in the independent test set (Table 4), the method correctly
classiﬁes 252 out of the 273 proteins (92.31%). The speciﬁcity of
the method in detecting secretory signal peptides is very satisfactory
since it wrongly assigns a signal peptide in 31 out of the 601
cytoplasmic proteins and in 25 out of the 192 TM proteins. These
results correspond to a speciﬁcity of 92.94%, with an MCC of 0.82.
PRED-TATHMMER is more speciﬁc but less sensitive; nevertheless,
achieves the second higher MCC among the methods tested. We
should note that the overall MCCs reported here concerning SignalP
correspond clearly to lower values compared with those reported in
the original publications (Bendtsen et (11., 2004; Nielsen et (11., 1997)
where the authors reported larger MCCs for bacterial predictors
mainly caused by SignalP”s lower speciﬁcity when tested on TM
proteins. Since we have reasons to believe that many of the proteins
in the test set were also present in the datasets used for training
the other methods overestimating thus the results, we compiled
another test set of proteins with potential signal peptides deposited
in Uniprot from 2009 onwards. After removing sequences similar

The test set contains no similar sequences to those included in the training set (see
Section 2). The set does not include Tat signal peptides and in such case, the speciﬁcity
of the Sec signal peptide predictors would be lower. The MCC is computed by comparing
Sec signal peptides versus non-Sec sequences (cytoplasmic and TM sequences).

to our training set we came up with 95 bacterial proteins. In this
set, FRED-TAT and Signava3-HMM correctly classify 92.63%,
Phobius 93.68% and Philius 91.58%. All the other methods perform
worse (70—90%, data not shown).

Concerning the precise location of the cleavage site of Tat signal
peptides, FRED-TAT outperforms TatP in the cross-validation on the
training set (70% versus 64.67%) and performs equally well when
tested on the TatP training set (both methods yield 75.24%). When
we consider as correct a prediction within :l:2 residues of the actual
cleavage site, we obtain similar results (i.e. 78.67% versus 72.67%
in the former set and 81.90% versus 80.95% in the latter). As we
already mentioned, TATFIND and the proﬁle HMMs of PFAM and
TIGR are not capable of predicting the location of the cleavage
site, and thus cannot be tested. Moreover, in the independent test
set the precise location of the cleavage sites was not known.
PRED-TATHMMER performs similarly in both sets. Concerning the
accuracy in predicting the cleavage sites of Sec signal peptides,
FRED-TAT predicts correctly the location of the cleavage site in
78.66% of the proteins in the training set (89.94% when counting
predictions within :l:2 residues of the actual cleavage site) and
78.02% of the proteins in the independent test set (83.88% when
counting predictions within :l:2 residues of the actual cleavage site).
These results are approximately equally good compared with RPSP,
PrediSi, Phobius and Philius and slightly worse compared with
both versions of Signava3 (data not shown). PRED-TATHMMER
performs slightly worse in this dataset.

The most important feature of the method is the fact that it is
capable of simultaneously predicting and discriminating Sec from
Tat signal peptides. If for example, one performed the analysis
concerning Sec signal peptides and included in the dataset a number
of Tat signal sequences, the majority of general signal peptide
predictors would have predicted a signiﬁcant number of them to be
Sec signal peptides. If on the other hand, one tries to combine two
different predictors (i.e. TatP and SignalP), then he/she would have
to devise an algorithm for prioritization. For instance, we could give

priority to TatP, or alternatively, the user may choose the predictor
with the highest D-score. This strategy was also applied for the
proﬁle HMMs (PRED-TATHMMER) that we developed, which also
can be considered as a combination of two independent predictors
and the results are presented in Supplementary Tables 2—4, where
the superiority of the combined predictor is highlighted.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we proposed an efﬁcient method for the combined
prediction of Tat and Sec signal peptides. The HMM method
(FRED-TAT) that we developed was tested on various carefully
selected datasets and in all cases was shown to outperform TatP and
TATFIND in almost all measures of accuracy (sensitivity, speciﬁcity
and MCC, as well as the correct prediction of the cleavage site).
TATFIND seems to be close in overall accuracy, but its main
disadvantage is that it cannot predict the location of the cleavage
site resulting this way in a reduced ﬁinctionality. The proﬁle HMMs
from PFAM and TIGR seem to be very speciﬁc, but suffer in terms
of sensitivity, at least when the suggested trusted cutoff is used;
additionally, they also are incapable of predicting the cleavage site.
The proﬁle HMMs generated by us (PRED-TATHMMER) seem to be
a very easily applicable and useﬁil alternative. FRED-TAT was also
proved to be very accurate in the correct prediction of Sec signal
peptides, comparing favorably even to the top-scoring predictors.
Nevertheless, we have clearly shown that a combined predictor such
as FRED-TAT performs better predicting simultaneously Tat and Sec
signal peptides.

The HMM, as a machine learning method, is capable of detecting
the general preferences of Tat signal peptides that discriminate them
from Sec signal peptides, such as the longest n-region, the RR motif
and the less hydrophobic h-region. However, variations do exist
between organisms due to differences in the Tat machinery itself. For
instance, in some rare cases, one of the two arginines in the RR motif
can be substituted by lysine without affecting the Tat-dependent
export (Hinsley et (11., 2001), whereas there are also variants with
an intervening Asparagine (RNR motif) (Ignatova et (11., 2002).
These rare variants are not tolerated by FRED-TAT, which was
trained using only ‘canonical’ Tat sequences (Fig. 2). TatP allows the

user to change the regular expression pattern and thus to perform
predictions by relaxing the RR motif assumption. This approach,
however, has limited useﬁilness in large-scale analyses since it
is not statistically validated (i.e. the number of false positives
will increase drastically). Mutagenesis studies in various model
organisms have also shown different properties concerning the
adjacency to the RR amino acids (DeLisa et (11., 2002; Kreutzenbeck
et (11., 2007; Kwan and Bolhuis, 2010; Li et (11., 2006). Moreover,
the situation is more complicated, since in many cases some signal
peptides possess intermediate properties. For instance, in some
cases, signal peptides are rerouted to the Sec machinery only after Tat
deactivation and in others, the signal sequences possess promiscuity
under physiological conditions (Tullman-Ercek et (11., 2007). Thus,
it would be non-realistic to expect having a single predictor that
could be predicting all these real-life situations. Nevertheless, in a
dataset of RR-containing signal peptides that were experimentally
veriﬁed not to be TAT substrates, FRED-TAT performs satisfactory,
a fact which indicates that indeed the algorithm extracted the general
preferences of Tat-substrates succesfully.

The method presented here was trained on a combined set of
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sequences. Even though
subtle differences exist between the signal peptides” cleavage sites
between these classes, the limited size of the training set dictated
this choice and the results are satisfactory. Perhaps in the near future,
where larger datasets may become available, a different predictor
may be feasible to be constructed. The test set also contained several
archaeal Tat signal sequences and these were predicted correctly as
well. A limitation of FRED-TAT (as well as the previously proposed
methods) is that it cannot discriminate Tat lipoproteins. Lipoproteins
exported using the Tat machinery have been observed lately, but
there are a limited number of well-characterized examples (Gimenez
et (11., 2007; Shruthi et (11., 2010a). Thus, only approaches based on
regular expression patterns could be developed for the prediction of
such proteins (Shruthi et (11., 2010b). However, in the future, where
more examples will become available, the ﬂexible architecture of the
HMM allows easily the extension to such cases. Another possible
extension would be to discriminate between signal anchored proteins
exported with the Tat pathway. Such proteins were excluded from
the training and test sets, but a ﬁiture extension of the method could
incorporate them in the ﬁnal prediction.

FRED-TAT is publicly available for non-commercial users at
http://www.compgen.org/tools/PRED-TAT/ where the user may
submit a single sequence in order to receive a detailed prediction
or upload a ﬁle in order to perform batch predictions (i.e. in a whole
genome). The proﬁle HMMs (PRED-TATHMMER) are also freely
available for download as an easy to use alternative for large-scale
analyses.

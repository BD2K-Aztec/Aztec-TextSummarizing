Abstract

Motivation: When processing gene expression profiles or other biological data, it is often required
to assign measurements to distinct categories (e.g. ’high’ and ’low’ and possibly ’intermediate’).
Subsequent analyses strongly depend on the results of this quantization. Poor quantization will
have potentially misleading effects on further investigations. We propose the BiTrinA package
that integrates different multiscale algorithms for binarization and for trinarization of one—dimen—
sional data with methods for quality assessment and visualization of the results. By identifying
measurements that show large variations over different time points or conditions, this quality as—

 

sessment can determine candidates that are related to the specific experimental setting.
Availability and implementation: BiTrinA is freely available on CRAN.

1 Introduction

In the context of analyzing biological data, such as gene expression
profiles, it is often necessary to identify those genes, transcripts or
proteins that display prominent variations over time or across differ-
ent experimental conditions. This can be required to preselect more
interesting candidates for subsequent analyses or to reveal data ap-
plicable for further approaches, such as Boolean network modeling.
This can be achieved by categorizing the data to a small number of
distinct groups and assigning validities to this categorization.

For simplicity, we will focus in the following on binarization
schemes and mention trinarization as their extension in the next sec-
tion. Binarization is the process of partitioning data into two groups
and assigning a single value to each. It can be seen as a special case
of discretizing a continuous signal into a k-valued signal with
xm < ... < any), for k : 2 (and k : 3 for trinarization) (Fayyad and
Irani, 1993; Dougherty et (11., 1995; Friedman and Goldszmidt,
1996). The most common approach is to binarize measurements

according to a threshold, such as the mean value (Kim et (11., 2007),
a quantile (Kaiser et (11., 2013) or more elaborate estimation tech-
niques as described by Shmulevich and Zhang (2002), Zhou et al.
(2003) or Hopfensitz et al. (2012). A threshold can also be learned
from external information (Kestler et (11., 2011; Schmid et (11., 2014).
One commonly assigns the value 0 to the data points below the
threshold (‘low’) and l to those above (‘high’). The aim of any such
binarization method is to find the most appropriate threshold.
Binarization is often part of data preprocessing on which further
analyses strongly depend. For example, gene expression data from
time series must be binarized for the reconstruction and simulation
of Boolean networks (see, e.g., Liang et (11., 1998; Lahdesmaki et (11.,
2003; Mussel et (11., 2010). Only then can these networks model
gene regulation by representing each gene as a binary variable illus-
trating the two states ‘active’ and ‘inactive’. In addition to being an
important prerequisite to various analyses, binarization and trinari-
zation can also be used independently to extract information. It can,
for example, serve as an unsupervised method to reveal patterns

Fig. 2. Heatmap of significantly binarized expression values (BASC B,
FDR/0.05) from the Drosophila dataset. Time points are sorted according to
developmental stages

selected. For each step function, the strongest discontinuity is
determined. For both multiscale algorithms, the binarization
threshold is defined as the median of these strongest discontinuities.

A bootstrap test is used to evaluate the robustness of this thresh-
old across the series of functions. A significant P-value indicates
that the variation of the location of the strongest discontinuity
across the step functions is low, i.e. the binarization threshold does
not change over multiple scales and the computed binarization is of
good quality (Fig. 1A).

For trinarization, the package also provides, apart from k-means
with k : 3, extensions of the BASC algorithms for the Trinarization
Across multiple SCales (TASC). The TASC algorithms discretize a
continuous signal into three values,

 : Hjxgllj + Hjxgllb

where (tl, £2) with £1 < t3 being a real-valued tuple of thresholds.
TASC A or TASC B inherit their optimization strategy from the cor-
responding BASC algorithms. They select candidate tuples according
to their achieved mean discontinuity for each optimal step function.
The final thresholds (tl, t2) can be seen as the median tuple of all se-
lected candidates. The stability of these thresholds can again be as-
sessed by a bootstrap algorithm.

2.2 Application

The following illustrates the application of the BiTrinA package
and its statistical tests on gene expression data. \We binarized, and
trinarized, a dataset containing gene expression measurements
(4028 genes, 67 time points) of the developmental stages (embry-
onic, larval, pupal and adult) of Drosop/Jilzz melmzogzzster
(Arbeitman et al., 2002). \We utilized the BASC B algorithm. After
correction for multiple testing (FDR < 0.05), 252 of the 4028 genes
are statistically significant according to BASC’s test for binarizeabil-
ity. A heatmap of the binarized signals can be found in Figure 2. As
an example, Figure 1B illustrates the binarization of the Rhodopsin
3 gene, which is a photoreceptor of the eye. It can be observed that
expression remains low throughout the first three developmental
stages but then peaks in the adult stage. This is properly reflected by

Table 1. 10x 10 crossvalidation results for the Drosophila
melanogasterdata (Arbeitman etal., 2002) (four classes)

the binarization, which achieves a highly significant P-value of
P < 10 m for this gene.

An interesting question with respect to this illustration might be
whether the statistical assessment of binarizeability can provide an
indication which of the measured genes are involved in the develop-
mental process. That is, can the statistical test identify genes whose
binarized measurements somehow reflect the known developmental
phases? Statistical evidence indeed suggests that there is a significant
association between the concordance of measurements with the de-
velopmental stages and their binarizeability (see Supplementary
Material). This shows the practical relevance of the proposed quality
assessment for the identification of potentially interesting candidate
genes for further investigation.

\We also performed crossvalidation classification experiments on
the binarizeable and trinarizable signals that indicate that indeed the
quantized information is sufficient for the categorization of the de-
velopmental stages (Table 1). The mean accuracy of a linear support
vector machine (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Mussel et al., 2012)
only declined by about 0.71% for BASC A and the TASC
algorithms, and 2.24% for BASC B while utilizing only 27.94%
(BASC A), 5.74% (BASC B) and 56.71% (TASC A), 18.18% (TASC
B) of all features. In terms of accuracy they outperformed the
k-means algorithm (10 restarts) that achieved a maximum mean
accuracy of 93.58%, with utilizing only 0.41% of all available
features.

3 Conclusion

Many analyses require a quantization of data and thus depend heav-
ily on this procedure’s results. However, not all data are
well binarizeable or trinarizable, and current implementations do
not include methods to assess the applicability of the original data
for such a method. Our R package BiTrinA integrates statistical
testing procedures that are capable of assessing the binarizeability
and trinarizability, and consequently the quality of discretizing of
biological data. As such, the approaches can be used to identify can-
didate measurements that may be relevant for further analyses.

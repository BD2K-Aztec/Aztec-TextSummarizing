ABSTRACT

Summary: MAGI is a web service for fast MicroRNA-Seq data ana-
lysis in a graphics processing unit (GPU) infrastructure. Using just a
browser, users have access to results as web reports in just a few
hours—>600% end-to-end performance improvement over state of
the art. MAGI’s salient features are (i) transfer of large input files in
native FASTA with Qualities (FASTQ) format through drag-and-drop
operations, (ii) rapid prediction of microRNA target genes leveraging
parallel computing with GPU devices, (iii) all-in-one analytics with
novel feature extraction, statistical test for differential expression and
diagnostic plot generation for quality control and (iv) interactive visu-
alization and exploration of results in web reports that are readily avail-
able for publication.

Availability and implementation: MAGI relies on the Node.js
JavaScript framework, along with NVIDIA CUDA C, PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor (PHP), Perl and R. It is freely available at http://magi.
ucsd.edu.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single-stranded and nonepro-
tein-coding RNAs, with an average size of 22 bases that silence
target genes either by degradation of mRNA level or repression
of a translated protein. miRNAs have generated great interest by
the biomedical community because of their implications in
human disease and development. The advent of high-throughput
short-read sequencing has enabled comprehensive miRNA
studies. There are several web services for miRNA-seq data ana-
lysis targeting the needs of non-technical users. Deep-sequencing
Small RNA analysis Pipeline (DSAP) (Huang et a]. 2010) quan-
tifies known miRNAs, while miRAnalyzer (Hackenberg et al.,
2011), Computational Platform analysis of Small RNA deep
Sequencing data (CPSS) (Zhang et al., 2012) and wapRNA
(Zhao et al., 2011) perform novel miRNA prediction and

target prediction. mirTools (Zhu et al., 2010) add functional an-
notation, while omiRas (Muller et al., 2013) allows for upload of
raw FASTQ ﬁles.

However, there are a number of issues that limit the adoption
and usability of these services in real-world scenarios. Many of
these tools incur signiﬁcant ﬁle transfer and preprocessing over-
heads. Existing web services for miRNA-seq do not handle large
FASTQ ﬁles. For instance, omiRas is limited to 2 GB inputs.
Furthermore, because of a user’s browser or web server limita-
tions, a user cannot upload multiple large files and the connec-
tion to the server may get lost during ﬁle transfers. A common
work-around is to run command-line scripts that downsize the
input before uploadia cumbersome and error-prone two-step
approach that alienates non-technical users who may not have
experience with complex Perl- or Python-based parsing scripts
and their cryptic parameter settings. Additionally, prediction of
miRNA targets is a time-consuming task that delays downstream
analyses. Moreover, most tools do not provide a statistical test
for novel miRNA differential expression; statistical quality con-
trol is limited, as base quality scores and summary statistics for
aligned reads are ignored. Lastly, most tools generate simple
static image plots, where in-depth analysis and interactive ren-
dering are not possible.

2 DESCRIPTION

MAGI addresses these limitations by fully embracing the
HTMLS-technology with a Node.js-based web service backend
for the analysis of miRNA sequencing data directly from
FASTQ ﬁles. The results can later be retrieved and shared with
others Via a unique URL provided directly during the analysis or
Via email. To aid new users, we provide tutorial links to the web
reports generated with peer-reviewed published data, including
miRNA-seq in Kawasaki Disease (Shimizu et al., 2013). MAGI’s
backend further incorporates graphics processing unit (GPU)
devices to tremendously speed-up the analyses and deliver results
in just a couple of hours instead of days. Open-source technol-
ogies, such as PHP, Perl and R running on top of a Linux plat-
form drive the generation of a web report consisting of quality
plots, alignment, pile-up charts of mapped reads, secondary
structure of precursor miRNAs, differentially expressed
miRNA between two groups, predicted miRNA target genes

and enriched pathways. In this article, we introduce four novel
features of MAGI. Technical details are provided in the
Supplementary Material.

#17MAGI natively accepts large FASTQ format ﬁles as
input, requiring no additional file processing by the user. For
instance, in Figure 1, with a simple drag and drop into the
browser, six FASTQ files are added to the processing queue
using HTML5 WebWorkers that scan over the short reads and
compress each sequence from a 3GB FASTQ ﬁle down to a 3
MB read-count hash-table ﬁle, completely within the browser.
This process makes the processed data small enough to reach our
server in just a few seconds. The adoption of WebWorkers tech-
nology reduced the end-to-end analysis time of 24 microRNA-
Seq samples (total size 48 GB) down to 4h using a 2012
MacBook Air with 1.3 GHz dual core CPU, 4 GB RAM, 500
GB HDD. Comparatively, when using omiRas, the FASTQ
input file transfer time alone took 5h. miRAnalyzer and
miRTools require ﬁle preprocessing that alone took $7 h before
uploading them to the web service.

#27MAGI uses our parallel implementation of miRanda
(Enright et al., 2003), a widely used CPU algorithm for miRNA
target identification. Its Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture C
implementation (Wang et al., 2014) modiﬁes and parallelizes the
SmitheWaterman algorithm to return multiple alignment results
with the corresponding trace-back sequences plus heuristic rules
for miRNAs. Four NVIDIA M2090 GPU devices (6 GB
memory) are installed in our MAGI server and reduced the pre-
diction time from hours using just the CPU to a few minutes using
the GPU devices additionally.

#37MAGI predicts novel miRs using a novel feature-extrac-
tion algorithm and random forest-based classiﬁer in just minutes
(Stepanowsky et al., 2012). With miRDeep2 (Friedlander et al.,
2008), a widely used novel miR prediction algorithm, the predic-
tion module alone took 12el6h with the same 24 samples. Then,
a list of differentially expressed miRNAs between two groups is
tabulated using the DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010) R package
that performs a statistical test for both known and novel
miRNAs with multiple samples. For quality control, MAGI’s
web-socket module collects diagnostic statistics and plots such
as average quality score, length distribution of trimmed reads
and Guanine-Cytosine contents at the time of FASTQ ﬁle drag
and drop by a user.

#PMAGI generates D3 and jQuery-enabled charts where
users can zoom in/out, mouse over for actual numbers and
export them as separate image ﬁles. Tables and pile-up charts
are interactive as users can sort and filter with different cutoff
values. Such powerful Visualization features enable users to dis-
cover signals and patterns.

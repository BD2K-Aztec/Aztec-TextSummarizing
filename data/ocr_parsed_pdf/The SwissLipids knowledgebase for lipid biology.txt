Abstract

Motivation: Lipids are a large and diverse group of biological molecules with roles in membrane
formation, energy storage and signaling. Cellular lipidomes may contain tens of thousands of
structures, a staggering degree of complexity whose significance is not yet fully understood. High—
throughput mass spectrometry—based platforms provide a means to study this complexity, but the
interpretation of lipidomic data and its integration with prior knowledge of lipid biology suffers
from a lack of appropriate tools to manage the data and extract knowledge from it.

Results: To facilitate the description and exploration of lipidomic data and its integration with prior
biological knowledge, we have developed a knowledge resource for lipids and their biology—
SwissLipids. SwissLipids provides curated knowledge of lipid structures and metabolism which is
used to generate an in silico library of feasible lipid structures. These are arranged in a hierarchical
classification that links mass spectrometry analytical outputs to all possible lipid structures, meta—
bolic reactions and enzymes. SwissLipids provides a reference namespace for lipidomic data publi—
cation, data exploration and hypothesis generation. The current version of SwissLipids includes
over 244 000 known and theoretically possible lipid structures, over 800 proteins, and curated links
to published knowledge from over 620 peer—reviewed publications. We are continually updating
the SwissLipids hierarchy with new lipid categories and new expert curated knowledge.

1 Introduction

Lipids are a large and diverse group of biological molecules that per—
form a wide variety of biological functions (Sud et (11., 2007). They
comprise the bulk of membrane bilayers (Holthuis and Menon,
2014; van Meer et (11., 2008) and energy stores (Lass et (11., 2011),
provide markers for the recognition and sorting of distinct organ—
elles (Balla, 2013), and regulate processes such as cell proliferation
and death (Morad and Cabot, 2013), immunity (Knowlden and
Georas, 2014; Simmons and Ishii, 2014), angiogenesis, cardiogene—
sis and neurogenesis (Mendelson et (11., 2014) and inﬂammation (Ji
et (11., 2011). The lipid complement or ‘lipidome’ of individual cells
may include hundreds of thousands of lipid structures whose occur—
rence is tightly regulated in response to changes in the cellular envir—
onment and lipid availability (Gross and Han, 2011; Shevchenko
and Simons, 2010). Dysregulation of the lipidome is a feature of
many pathological conditions including cardiovascular disease
(Sigruener et (11., 2014), hypertension (Graessler et (11., 2009), dia—
betes (Meikle et (11., 2014) and Alzheimer (Bennett et (11., 2014;
Mapstone et (11., 2014), for which lipids may comprise an important
source of biomarkers. Pathogens also manipulate the host lipidome
in order to facilitate their own persistence and replication (Loizides—
Mangold et (11., 2014; Lyn et (11., 2014).

Elucidating the roles of lipids in biological systems requires the
integration of quantitative measurements of lipidome composition
with knowledge of lipid metabolic pathways, enzymes and interact—
ing proteins. Lipidome composition may be analyzed using mass
spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)—based
approaches which are able to quantify hundreds of lipid species over
a broad dynamic range (da Silveira Dos Santos et (11., 2014). These
approaches provide information on the atomic composition of intact
lipids and their component parts (such as acyl chains) which can be
mapped to prior knowledge of lipid structures using a standardized
hierarchical notation (Liebisch et (11., 2013). One of the foremost
sources of such knowledge is the LIPID MAPS Structure Database
(LMSD), which provides a comprehensive classification of over
37000 lipid structures grouped in 8 major lipid categories—fatty
acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterol lip—
ids, prenol lipids, polyketides and saccharolipids (Fahy et (11., 2007).
Other resources and tools for the analysis of lipidomic data include
LipidBLAST, which provides a library of 120 000 lipid structures
(some derived from LIPID MAPS) and associated theoretical tandem
mass spectra (Kind et (11., 2013), LipidHome, a database of over 36
million hypothetical glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid structures
specifically designed for MS data integration (Foster et (11., 2013)
and Visualization and phospholipid identification (VaLID) which
provides a search engine for a library of hypothetical glycerophos—
pholipid structures somewhat similar to those of LipidHome
(Blanchard et (11., 2013). Specialized software for annotating MS
data include Lipiprlorer (Herzog et (11., 2013), szine (Pluskal
et (11., 2010) and Lipid Data Analyzer (Hartler et (11., 2011). A com—
mon feature of all these resources and tools is that they focus mainly
on the classification and identification of lipids. Knowledge of lipid
biology, including links to metabolic pathways and enzymes, may
be found in public knowledge resources such as BRENDA (Chang
et (11., 2015), HMDB (Wishart et (11., 2013), KEGG (Kanehisa et (11.,
2014), MetaCyc (Caspi et (11., 2014) and Reactome (Croft et (11.,
2014). Although KEGG has been used as basis for computational
approaches for matching hypothetical structures to pathways
(Yetukuri et (11., 2007), these knowledge resources do not aim to
provide comprehensive coverage of the hundreds of thousands of
lipids that may exist in nature.

Here, we describe the development of a new knowledge resource
that is designed to help connect lipidomics and lipid biology—
SwissLipids. Our aim in creating SwissLipids was to provide a com—
prehensive reference database that can be used to describe mass
spectrometry—based lipid identifications and link them to curated
knowledge of lipid structures, metabolic reactions, enzymes and
interacting proteins. SwissLipids was created through an iterative
process in which prior knowledge of lipid structures and metabolism
curated from published literature is used to generate an in silico li—
brary of all feasible structures for common lipid categories.
These structures form the basis for a hierarchical lipid classification
that is consistent with currently accepted lipidomic data notation
and the classification of LIPID MAPS. The result is a reference
namespace for lipidomic data publication, data exploration and hy—
pothesis generation, allowing users to ask questions such as
‘where has this lipid species been seen before?’, ‘what structures
might this lipid species have?’, ‘what are the relevant metabolic reac—
tions?’ and ‘what proteins are known to interact with these putative
structures?’

2 Methods

2.1 Curation of lipid structures and metabolism

We performed systematic curation of experimental knowledge of
lipid structures using the chemical ontology ChEBI (Hastings et (11.,
2013) and of lipid metabolism using the annotated reaction data—
base Rhea (Morgat et (11., 2015) for several of the most common
lipid categories including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty
acyls and sphingolipids. We focused mainly on lipids and enzymes
of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but information from other species was
also included when required to complete metabolic pathways (as in
the desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids or PUFAs).
Enzymatic reactions were curated in the SwissLipids database by
linking UniProtKB (UniProt Consortium, 2014) protein acces—
sion numbers to Rhea reaction identifiers. All annotations in
SwissLipids are associated with supporting evidence which includes
a mandatory evidence type, represented by a code from the Evidence
Codes Ontology (ECO) (Chibucos et (11., 2014) and supporting
source text and literature citation where applicable (articles from
the scientific literature are represented as PubMed records). All an—
notations were checked for accuracy and consistency by a second
curator.

2.2 Generation and annotation of lipid structures

Curated knowledge of experimentally characterized lipid structures
and metabolism was used to design and create a library of theoretic—
ally feasible lipid structures in silico. Lipid structures were generated
using the Java application SMILIB v2.0 (Schiiller et (11., 2007) which
combines SMILES (Weininger, 1988) representations of chemical
substructures. Each structure was annotated with a standard name
and abbreviations (created using a custom Perl script that follows
accepted naming conventions of LIPID MAPS), as well as lipid class
and fatty—acyl/alkyl components (including mappings to ChEBI) and
their positions on the glycerol backbone. Formula, InChI and InChI
key (Heller et (11., 2013) and masses were calculated using the
MolConvert and cxcalc tools (http://www.chemax0n.c0m), and
exact m/z values for the following selected adducts were also calcu—
lated: [M.]+, [M+H]+, [M+K] +, [M+Na]+, [M+Li] +,
[M +NH4] + , [M — H] — , [M + Cl] — , [M + OAc] — . Mappings to

Table 1. The hierarchical classification used in SwissLipids

 

 

Level Example

Category Glycerophospholipid

Class Glycerophosphocholine

Class Monoalkylmonoacylglycerophosphocholine
Species PC(O—36:5)

Molecular subspecies PC(O—16:1_20:4)

Structural subspecies PC(P—l 6 :0/20z4)

Isomeric subspecies PC(P—l 6:0/20:4(5Z,8Z, 1 1Z, 14Z))

 

The hierarchy includes seven levels that are illustrated below with a single
example. The hierarchy is compatible with that of LipidHome (Foster et al.,
2013) but uses only known components in the generation of the base Isomeric
subspecies. The hierarchy is fully mapped to ChEBI at all levels. The preﬁx
‘07’ indicates an alkyl bond, the preﬁx ‘Pi’ a 1Z-alkenyl bond and the ab-
sence of a preﬁx an ester bond. PC, phosphatidylcholine.

corresponding structures in ChEBI, HMDB and LMSD were estab—
lished by matching InChI keys.

2.3 Generation of the lipid hierarchy

Glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid structures were used as the
basis for the generation of a hierarchy of analytical outputs from
mass spectrometry experiments (Liebisch et al., 2013). The lipid
hierarchy was generated using custom software that takes as input a
set of structures and a template file that specifies the required anno—
tations for each of the corresponding higher levels and the relations
that link them (Table 1). These annotations include lipid nomencla—
ture and human readable descriptions, ChEBI identifiers for lipid
parent classes and parent components, SMILES representations, for—
mula, mass and m/z values for adducts, and InChI and InChI keys
where applicable.

2.4 Curation of the lipid hierarchy

The lipid hierarchy was curated using experimental literature on the
occurrence of lipids in biological systems. Qualitative annotations
take the form of a link between a lipid identifier (generally one of
Species, Molecular subspecies or Structural subspecies), a term from
the Gene Ontology (GO) (Blake et al., 2013) or the cross—species tis—
sue and cell ontology Uberon (Mungall et al., 2012), and a taxo—
nomic identifier (NCBI Resource Coordinators, 2014). As with
other annotation types, all annotations of lipid occurrence in
SwissLipids are associated with supporting evidence represented by
a code from the Evidence Codes Ontology (ECO) and supporting
source text and literature citation where applicable.

2.5 Databases

SwissLipids data is organized in a set of MySQL tables. Data from
external reference resources such as ChEBI (Hastings et al., 2013),
Rhea (Morgat et al., 2015), UniProtKB (UniProt Consortium,
2014), GO (Blake et al., 2013), Cellosaurus and Uberon (Mungall
et al., 2012) is sourced from local copies synchronized on a weekly
basis.

2.6 Website development

The SwissLipids website has been developed using the Angulaer
(http://www.angularjs.0rg) framework and server side PHP scripts
(http://www.php.net). SVG images of molecules are generated from
their mol representations using MolConvert (http://www.chem—
axon.c0m).

3 Results and discussion

3.1 SwissLipids content

SwissLipids includes over 2000 curated enzymatic reactions which
directly link more than 800 proteins (UniProtKB) and 1500 reac—
tions (Rhea) and supporting evidence. These annotations cover a
variety of lipid categories including glycerophospholipids, glyceroli—
pids, sphingolipids, sterols, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and wax
esters. As the number of experimentally characterized lipid struc—
tures constitutes only a small fraction of the number of possible
structures that may exist in nature (Gross and Han, 2011;
Shevchenko and Simons, 2010), the curated knowledge available in
SwissLipids was used to design and generate an in silico library of
feasible lipid structures for selected common lipid categories. The
current version of this library features 244 155 structures—hereafter
referred to as Isomeric subspecies—from 38 classes of glycerophos—
pholipid and 13 classes of glycerolipid (Supplementary Table S1)
including 80 fatty acids and 18 fatty alcohols (Supplementary
Table S2). Forthcoming versions of SwissLipids will generalize this
approach to other lipid categories for which curated data is avail—
able, including more classes of glycerophospholipid as well as
sphingolipids. Structures are arranged in a hierarchical classification
consistent with the latest lipid notation (Liebisch et al., 2013) that
includes 91 124 Structural subspecies (which assume knowledge of
lipid class and the composition and positions of individual fatty acyl
groups), 45 571 Molecular subspecies (which assume knowledge of
lipid class and the composition of individual fatty acyl groups) and
5508 Species (which assume knowledge of lipid class and the sum
composition of all fatty acyl groups) (Table 1). The SwissLipids hier—
archy includes curated lipid identifications from published literature
for over 300 Species, Molecular subspecies and Structural
subspecies.

The combinatorial generation of lipid structures described here
and elsewhere (Blanchard et al., 2013; Foster et al., 2013) may pro—
duce lipid structures that do not exist in nature, and SwissLipids in—
cludes significantly more glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid
structures than reference databases such as LMSD (which leverages
the expert knowledge of the LIPID MAPS consortium). Although
the existence of these extra structures is currently unproven, the use
of known structural building blocks from the reference
ontology ChEBI ensures that they are at least relevant to our current
understanding of lipid structures and metabolism, and the procedure
for brute force enumeration of structures is completely transparent.
The SwissLipids library also provides a means to link structures
from other databases such as HMDB and LMSD to published lipid
identifications and to metabolic reactions (described using Rhea)
and enzymes (UniProtKB), and is cross—referenced by the experimen—
tal lipidomics platform of the LipidX consortium (www.1ipid0mes.
org).

3.2 SwissLipids website and access

The SwissLipids website at www.swisslipids.0rg provides a simple
interface to search for lipids (by identifiers, names, synonyms, ab—
breviations, formulae, m/z values for common adducts and SMILES,
InChI and InChI key representations). Users may also browse the
SwissLipids hierarchy at http://www.swisslipids.org/#/br0wse, be—
ginning at Species level with the selection of the desired lipid class
and the number of carbon atoms and double bonds in the acyl
chains (Fig. 1). This returns a list of all possible Molecular subspe-
cies, Structural subspecies and Isomeric subspecies. Exploration of
the result lists is facilitated by a simple icon system that indicates the
available information for each lipid entry (Fig. 1). Individual lipids

Fig. 1. Browsing SwissLipids. Users can enter the lipid hierarchy at Species level by specifying the desired lipid class and number of carbon atoms and double
bonds. The result lists consist of the corresponding Molecular subspecies, Structural subspecies and Isomeric subspecies. Color-coded icons with abbreviations
provide an overview of the available information for lipids—their meaning can be revealed by moving the mouse over them. In this example the lipid Species
Phosphatidylcholine (0-365) has 7 Molecular subspecies, 9 Structural subspecies (for which the list is not expanded) and 20 Isomeric subspecies. The Molecular
subspecies Phosphatidylcholine (O-16:0_20:5) and Phosphatidylcholine (O—16:1_20:4) have experimental data on their location in specific tissues or taxa (indi-
cated by the brown “lo” icon), while the Isomeric subspecies 1-O—(1Zhexadeceny|)-2-(5Z8Z11Z14Zeicosatetraenoyl)-sn-g|ycero-3-phosphocholine has experi-
mental data relating to metabolism (indicated by the purple ’me’ icon). All lipids have cheminformatic descriptors (green ’ch’ icon) and are classified (orange ’cl’

icon) in the SwissLipids hierarchy

as well as complete result lists may be selected for the identifier map—
ping service (http://www.swisslipids.org/#/mapper), which maps
lipid identifiers from SwissLipids, ChEBI, HMDB and LMSD to
each other as well as to the corresponding biochemical reactions
from Rhea and curated enzymes from SwissLipids. Individual lipid
entry pages provide key information including structure, cheminfor—
matics descriptors, nomenclature, classification, reactions, enzymes,
and subcellular and tissular location (Fig. 2). Enzyme names link to
protein entry pages that list all curated information from
SwissLipids, such as Rhea reactions and citations (not shown).
SwissLipids may also be searched and accessed through the ExPASy

bioinformatics resource portal (http://www.expasy.org) (Artimo
etal.,2012).

4 Conclusions

SwissLipids provides a core of curated information on lipid struc—
tures and metabolism which serves as the base for the generation of
a library of all feasible lipid structures (according to our current
knowledge of the relevant lipid structural classes) and their corres—
ponding analytical outputs for MS and MS/MS. The curation of

Fig. 2. A SwissLipids entry. SwissLipids entry pages provide information on lipid structure and nomenclature (top panel), cheminformatics descriptors (second
panel), lipid classification and components (third panel), reactions (Rhea) and enzymes (UniProtKB) (fourth panel), and subcellular (GO) and tissular (Uberon) lo-
cation (not shown) which can be navigated through distinct tabs. Links to other databases such as ChEBI, HMDB and LIPID MAPS are also provided. The lipid clas-
sification indicates the structural class of lipid (here, 1-O—(1Z—alkenyl)-2-acy|-sn-g|ycero-3-phosphocholine) and its ’analytical parent’ (the Structural subspecies
Phosphatidylcholine (P—16:0/20:4)) as well as the individual components (hexadecanoI-1-ol and 52,82,11Z14Z—eicosatetraenoate) and the annotations available
for each. The underlying evidence for curated assertions can be viewed by clicking on ’see evidence’ (see fourth panel)

information using ChEBI, Rhea and UniProtKB provides a ready— enzyme nomenclature and classification (Fleischmann et al., 2004),
made mapping of SwissLipids to these widely used resources and the MetaNetX.org platform for the analysis of metabolic models
others that reference them such as the MetaboLights repository for (Bernard et al., 2014; Ganter et al., 2013) and the genome annota—

metabolomic studies (Haug et al., 2013), the IntEnz resource for tion platform MicroScope (Vallenet et al., 2013). As well as

The SwissLipids knowledgebase

enriching SwissLipids with new lipid categories, structures and cura—
ted information, we plan to provide enhanced search options that in—
clude common isotopes and fragmentation patterns, and to improve
interoperability by providing annotations and structures using the
W3C standard RDF, a mainstay of large bioinformatics resources
like UniProtKB.

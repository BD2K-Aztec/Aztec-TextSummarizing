estMOI

 

estimate. The inputs are alignment (BAM ﬁles), variant regions
in the Variant Call Format/V CF and an optional ﬁle of regions
to exclude from analysis. Minimal multiplicity is inferred by con—
sidering the maximum number of distinct haplotypes formed by
combinations of a user—specifled number of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) on single or paired reads. The default
setting is to consider SNPs on read pairs, as haplotypes formed
using too many SNPs on only single reads, may lead to MOI
artefacts due to sequencing errors. The local minimum haplotype
frequency (default value 3) and total count (coverage, default 10)
can be set to reduce the number of spurious estimates due to
sequencing or mapping errors. In addition, a distributional cut—
off can be set to exclude extreme values when estimating overall
MOI (default 90th percentile).

To evaluate estMOI, it was implemented on several collections
of Pfalciparum with Illumina deep sequencing data. All the cor—
responding raw sequence data [SRA Study ERP000190, Manske
et a]. (2012); Robinson et a]. (2011)] consists of paired end reads
of minimum length 54 bp and was mapped to the 3D7
Pfalciparum reference genome (v3.0) using smalt (www.sanger.
ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/). Accuracy of MOI estimates
using whole—genome sequence data may be affected by low
read coverage, and all isolates had at least 30—fold coverage.
The alignments were processed as described previously
(Robinson et al., 2011) to construct VCF (v4.1) files consisting
of SNPs and indels (with quality scores of 30 or more). An ex—
clusion file consisting of sub—telomeric and highly variable gene
families was also constructed. The software was executed using
default values, and the average run time per sample on standard
desktop was ~10 min, a process that is highly parallelizable.

The algorithm was tested on a resequencing data of the 3D7
reference genome, where as expected few SNPs were found, and
an MOI of 1 was confirmed. To assess its performance on other
clonal samples, we used sequence data from four isolates that
have been under long—term culture [DD2, GB4, HB3 and 7G8,
(Sepulveda et al., 2013)]. The four clonal strains all had MOI of
one. To evaluate estMOI in the case of mixed infections, we
combined reads from two clonal isolates and confirmed a MOI
of 2. As estMOI accuracy in a clinical sample setting may be
affected by SNP density, we considered samples with at least 25K
differences from the reference genome. We applied estMOI to
sequence data for 54 clinical isolates from west Africa, where
multiplicity information using M SP1 and M SP2 genotyping
was available (Amambua—Ngwa et al., 2012). The estimates for
the presence of multiplicity from our method were in 65% con—
cordant with MSP results. The 35% discordance arises when our
method estimated the presence of multiple genotypes, whereas
the MSP typing reported single infections. This difference may
be explained by the high error rate of MSP—based genotyping
and its potentially low detectability (Ross et al., 2011).

To infer any relationship between the estimated MOI and
transmission, we considered sequence data from Burkina Faso
(n = 25, medium transmission), Cambodia (n: 25, low and cul—
tured), Malawi (n = 25, medium to high), Mali (n = 25, medium),
Thailand (n=25, low and cultured) and Papua New Guinea
(n = 11) (Preston et al., 2012; M.Preston, submitted for publica—
tion). The MOI estimate for the clinical isolates varied according
to transmission intensity and geographical origin of samples.
Isolates from southeast Asia, where transmission is lower had

the least proportion of multiple infections (Cambodia 4%;
Thailand 7%, Papua New Guinea 16%). Conversely, isolates
from Africa had a higher proportion of multiple infections
(Mali 44%; Malawi 48%, Burkina Faso 54%). A previous
study in Malawi estimated MOI from a single locus circumspor—
ozoite protein gene using deep sequencing of T—cell epitope
haplotypes (mean MOI 2.31) and genotyping of the NANP
repeat region (mean MOI 1.29). Our Malawi result (mean
MOI 3.47) is higher than the former, supporting the potential
utility of our approach and whole—genome estimates.

3 DSCUSSON

The number of whole—genome sequenced parasite samples taken
directly from malaria patients is growing rapidly, primarily due
to improvements in sequencing technology, throughput and
multiplexing. Establishing the MOI of Pfalciparum samples
using sequence data will assist with understanding the dynamics
of infections, pathogenesis, effect of transmission intensity, drug
efﬁcacy and parasite genetics. The estMOI software can rapidly
determine an estimate of MOI, and we have demonstrated that
these results correlate highly with both MSP2 genotyping and
transmission intensity. A sufﬁcient density of SNPs is required to
provide local estimates, but too great concentration of SNPs may
be evidence of sequencing or mapping errors. Data filtering
based on mapping qualities and coverage can assist with mini—
mizing over—inﬂated MOI estimates. The estMOI may be used to
identify potentially informative regions with high MOI across
multiple samples as suitable candidates for future genotyping.
We identified 26 potentially MOI informative genes (see
Supplementary Materials). Further use may come from
applying estMOI to other organisms, especially those that are
highly polymorphic. The application to 26 publicly available
Plasmodium vivax isolates (Auburn et al., 2013) revealed multiple
infections in 27% of the samples. In the future, it is expected that
developments in single molecule sequencing are likely to increase
read length and improve MOI estimates. However, in mixtures
of highly related genomes, it may not be possible to accurately
estimate the MOI, even when using whole—chromosome se—
quences (because they segregate independently) (Nkhoma
et al., 2012). Nonetheless, technological developments will in—
crease the read length and accuracy of polymorphic calls,
making our approach more robust and sensitive.

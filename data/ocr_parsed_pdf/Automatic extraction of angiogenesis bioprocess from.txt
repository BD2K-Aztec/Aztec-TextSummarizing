ABSTRACT

Motivation: Understanding key biological processes (bioprocesses)
and their relationships with constituent biological entities and
pharmaceutical agents is crucial for drug design and discovery. One
way to harvest such information is searching the literature. However,
bioprocesses are difficult to capture because they may occur in
text in a variety of textual expressions. Moreover, a bioprocess is
often composed of a series of bioevents, where a bioevent denotes
changes to one or a group of cells involved in the bioprocess. Such
bioevents are often used to refer to bioprocesses in text, which
current techniques, relying solely on specialized lexicons, struggle
to find.

Results: This article presents a range of methods for finding
bioprocess terms and events. To facilitate the study, we built a gold
standard corpus in which terms and events related to angiogenesis,
a key biological process of the growth of new blood vessels, were
annotated. Statistics of the annotated corpus revealed that over
36% of the text expressions that referred to angiogenesis appeared
as events. The proposed methods respectively employed domain-
specific vocabularies, a manually annotated corpus and unstructured
domain-specific documents. Evaluation results showed that, while a
supervised machine-learning model yielded the best precision, recall
and F1 scores, the other methods achieved reasonable performance
and less cost to develop.

Availability: The angiogenesis vocabularies, gold standard corpus,
annotation guidelines and software described in this article are

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background and motivation

Biological processes (i.e. bioprocesses) occur in living organisms
and the regulation of them is crucial to control and maintain the life
cycles of the organisms. A bioprocess may consist of any number
of chemical reactions or other types of biological events that may
result in maintenance, changes or transformations of the organism.
In drug discovery, it is important to understand bioprocesses and
how they are regulated under normal conditions and dysregulated in
disease. Regulation of bioprocesses may involve modulating their
frequency, rate or extent, through the control of gene expression,

protein modiﬁcation or interaction with a protein, substrate molecule
or larger structures. Scientists often need to gather facts that come
from clear scientiﬁc evidence of how, when modulated, an existing
or potential drug target affects critical pathophysiological processes
leading to either the disease cure, prevention or amelioration of
symptoms in the clinical setting. Typically, a bank of preclinical
evidence is developed using cell lines, model organisms and
clinical samples associating a target with key bioprocesses (and so
disease phenotype). However, this process is very expensive and
time consuming (Kola and Landis, 2004). To avoid unnecessary
duplication of research, scientists must ﬁrst review external activity
in their area of interest in order to determine what questions
remain unanswered, and to derive information to support or contest
hypotheses. Laboratory resources may then be more efﬁciently
directed to explore those questions. One important source of this
information is published biomedical articles. However, given the
vastness of the literature and an accelerating publication rate, manual
techniques and conventional information retrieval techniques are
unable to deliver timely, reliable, exhaustive and speciﬁc results. In
addition, the scientiﬁc and publication process is not static in nature,
but instead a continuous one.

Text mining technology has been increasingly popular to support
knowledge discovery, hypothesis generation and to manage the
mass of biological literature (Ananiadou et (11., 2010; Hunter and
Cohen, 2006), and text mining has shown promises for ﬁnding
key biological entities (e.g. Smith et (11., 2008), relationships
among proteins (e.g. Krallinger et (11., 2008a) and for establishing
functional annotations (e.g. Alex et (11., 2008).

As far as we know, there has been limited work in text mining
to extract bioprocesses. One reason is due to its complexity. A
bioprocess often involves a series of bioevents, where an event
expresses a change of state of a cell or tissue, and such events
are often used to refer to the bioprocess they participate in.
In this article, we systematically investigate the extraction of
bioprocess-related terms and events, including the deﬁnition of
the task, the construction of a gold stande corpus for learning
and evaluation, and the proposal of a number of approaches to
identifying bioprocesses. We then compare the methods in terms
of their performance results, as well as the amount of manual
supervision required, as both of the factors are main considerations
when deploying a new text mining system in practice.

Our work focuses on an exemplar biological process,
angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a key physiological process involving
the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, and it
is vital in growth and development of tissues and organs. It is also
a crucial step in the transition of tumours from a dormant state

to a malignant one. Therefore, the identiﬁcation of gene products
involved in regulating angiogenesis, and pharmacological agents
that have angiogenesis inhibitory effects, has been one of the main
lines of research for treatment of solid tumours, and hence mining
facts related to angiogenesis is a crucial step towards this goal.

1.2 Related Work

The recognition of speciﬁc biological processes in unstructured text
has received relatively less attention in the biomedical text mining
community. However, researchers have attempted to mine general
bioprocess information from other knowledge sources such as
ontology and biological data. For example, Hvidsten et (11. (2003)
proposed a systematic supervised learning model to predicting
bioprocess by analysing microarray data. Their method beneﬁted
from the functional annotation of genes in the Gene Ontology (GO)
(http://www.geneontology.org/GO.doc.shtml#biological_process).
The method was evaluated on genes coding for proteins known to
be involved in bioprocesses using cross-validation. Koike et (11.
(2004) reported work on ﬁnding relations between biological
functions and genes and gene products. Their method ﬁrst used
a named entity recognition programme to annotate genes, gene
products and biological function terms as deﬁned in GO, and
then extracted relations between the entities and bioﬁinctions by
analysing syntactic structures of the sentences. As noted by Koike
et (11., the terms for bioprocesses in GO were insufﬁcient for
automatic extraction in terms of recall. They experimented with a
number of techniques to augment the ﬁinctional terms, including
mining-related terms using high co-occurrence counts, retrieving
similar terms having similar collocations with G0 terms, etc.
However, neither of the approaches described above was able to
ﬁnd more complex bioprocess expressions such as events.

Recently, research has been conducted on the extraction of
biomolecular events. In particular, the BioNLP 2009 shared task
(Kim et al., 2009) attracted much attention and interesting solutions.
The shared task provided annotated data for several types of
gene-related bioevents, such as gene expression, transcription and
regulation, and participants were asked to identify the event type
and the word that triggers the event (i.e. trigger). The results of the
shared task showed that event extraction was challenging: the best
performing system achieved an overall Fl-score of 51.95% (B j orne,
et (11., 2009). After the shared tasks, researchers have proposed
methods that further improved the state of the art. For example,
Miwa et (11. (2010) proposed a method that detects, in sequence, the
event trigger and the edges linking the participants and the trigger,
and then ﬁnds the best combination of the edges to form a complex
event.

The BioNLP 2009 shared task did not include cellular or tissue
bioevents, which play a central role in bioprocesses and are the
focus of our work. The GENIA corpus (Kim et (11., 2008), however,
contains annotated examples of ‘cellular physiological process’,
which is similar to our event deﬁnition. However, this type of event
refers to a broad category and is not linked to any speciﬁc bioprocess,
whereas we would like to extract events that closely relate to a
given bioprocess such as angiogenesis. Section 2.1 provides more
discussion on the similarity and difference between GENIA and our
event deﬁnitions.

Also, GENIA style event annotation required both biological and
linguistic expertise and a lengthy annotation process (Kim et (11.,

2008). Despite the fact that the GENIA annotation has been proven
highly useful, people interested in mining bioevents in a new domain
may hesitate to follow GENIA”s strategy due to its high cost factor.
This contributed to our effort in exploring methods taking into
account not only performance scores, but also development cost.

2 METHODS
2.1 Task deﬁnition

Generally speaking. angiogenesis descriptions appear in text in one of the
following two forms: angiogenesis terms and angiogenesis events. where a
term refers to the name. synonym and other lexical variants of angiogenesis.
and an event refers to a cellular or tissue bioevent or reaction, taking place
as part of the bioprocess. For example, ‘angiogenesis” and ‘angiogenic” are
angiogenesis terms. and phrase ‘capillary endothelial cell proliferation”,
indicating a change of state of ‘capillary endothelial cell” , is an angiogenesis
event. In order to examine how often angiogenesis bioprocess is expressed
in the form of events. we created a corpus of 262 MEDLINE abstracts
(http://www.nlm.nihgov/databases/databases_medline.html). where angio-
genesis terms and events. as well as several types of bioentities that were
considered to closely relate to angiogenesis bioprocess, were manually
annotated. Table 1 shows the annotation markables and their counts of
occurrence in this corpus: 36.5% (479 out of 1313) of the angiogenesis
mentions are events. which highlights the importance of event recognition
for bioprocess extraction. The corpus was also used to develop supervised
machine learning systems and for evaluation. Section 2.5 gives detail on the
annotation and the learning systems.

The deﬁnition of angiogenesis event largely follows that of ‘cellular
physiological process”. a type of event deﬁned in GO and also in the GENIA
ontology (Kim et al. , 2006). However. our events are restricted to the domain
of angiogenesis. and do not contain explicit links to their trigger words and
participants. In GENIA deﬁnition (Kim et al., 2008), a participant is the
bioentity that is involved in an event. and each event must attach to a trigger
word denoting the action that caused the changes. For example, in GENIA
annotation. phrase ‘capillary endothelial cell proliferation” would have
‘proliferation’ marked as the trigger word and ‘capillary endothelial cell”
as the participant. In contrast, our annotation would regard the entire phrase
as an angiogenesis event, where trigger words and participants would not be
explicitly linked to the event. Section 2.5 elaborates the difference between
our event annotation and the GENIA project, and Table 3 shows some
illustrative examples. This decision signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed the annotation
process, and hence reduced the annotation cost. In summary. we deﬁne an
angiogenesis bioevent as either:

(1) the change of state of a cell, cell component or tissue that is speciﬁc
to angiogenesis. (e.g. ‘vascular sprouting”) or
(2) the change of state of some property of the entities mentioned above

(e.g. ‘increase in vascular density”).

As mentioned in the above deﬁnition. the key entities taking part in
angiogenesis are cell, cell components and tissues. For simplicity, they are
referred to as tissues, tissue terms or tissue entities in the rest of the article.

The term bioentity. on the other hand. is used to refer to genes. gene products
and the tissue entities as deﬁned above. Also, a trigger or trigger word is the
word which denotes the action that caused the changes of state in an event.

In our deﬁnition, the tissue terms are not restricted to nouns. In fact, our
corpus contains many tissues composed of words of other parts of speech
(POS), which would not be annotated as entities in other annotation projects.
such as GENIA (Kim et al., 2008). This decision was made due to the
observation that words of syntactic classes other than nouns (e.g. adjectives)
were often as informative as nouns in indicating the presence of a bioentity.
For example, ‘vascular”, ‘arterial” and ‘microvascular” are adjective tissue
entities that frequently occur in our corpus denoting something related to.
affecting. or consisting of blood vessels. We treated angiogenesis terms
the same way. The following sections propose methods for identifying
angiogenesis terms and events. and evaluation results.

2.2 Dictionary-based method

One solution to the extraction of angiogenesis terms and events is
using vocabularies. There are, however, limited lexical resources
available for biological process terms. While GO and MeSH
(http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) contain branches for biological processes.
the information provided for each speciﬁc process is very limited. For
example, the angiogenesis term in GO (GO:0001525) is annotated with only
one synonym: ‘blood vessel formation from pre-existing blood vessels”and
its descendent terms also look like deﬁnitions. e.g. ‘angiogenesis involved
in wound healing” (GO:0060978). Such terms and synonyms are insufﬁcient
to help computer programmes mine angiogenesis terms and events. which
highlighted the lack of ontological support for extracting bioprocesses from
text. Therefore. we manually built three vocabularies: angiogenesis terms,
tissues and triggers, where the ﬁrst vocabulary contains 10 variants of the
names and synonyms of angiogenesis. the second consists of 27 cell and
tissue entities related to angiogenesis and the third contains 39 derivation
forms of verbs that are good indicators of angiogenesis events. For
example, ‘angiogenesis” and ‘angiogenic” are terms in the ﬁrst vocabulary.
‘vascular” and ‘endothelial cell” appear in the second and ‘development”
and ‘proliferation” are examples from the third. The vocabularies are ﬂat
lists and do not contain any hierarchical information, and a domain expert
spent 40 h developing the vocabularies. We then designed patterns to extract
angiogenesis terms and events using the terms in the vocabularies.

The patterns are shown in Figure 1, where NP denotes a noun phrase.
Prep is a preposition. Phrase is a container enclosing any other query
components and ws denotes the maximum distance (i.e. number of words)
allowed between the components in a phrase. We applied pattern (A) to ﬁnd
angiogenesis terms, and based on the deﬁnition described in Section 2.1,
patterns (B) and (C) were used for recognizing angiogenesis events. In more
detail, pattern (B) ﬁnds noun phrases in which a tissue modiﬁes a trigger next
to it (i.e. ws = 0); and pattern (C) recognizes phrases where a tissue modiﬁes
a trigger as a preposition phrase and all components should occur adjacent
to each other. We chose these two particular syntactic structures to model
angiogenesis events based on domain experts” knowledge and observations.
For example, according to pattern C, phrase ‘development of endothelial
cell” will be tagged as an angiogenesis event, because ‘development” is
a trigger word. ‘of ” a preposition and ‘endothelial cell” is a tissue. The
patterns were applied at sentence level. and before applying the patterns.
the documents were pre-processed using the following natural language
processing (NLP) steps: sentence splitting. tokenization, POS tagging and
chunking, as described in Alex et al. (2008).

(A) NP { Angiogenesis_term }, or
(B) NP { Phrase (ws=0) { {Tissue} {Trigger} }, or
(C) Phrase (ws=0) { NP { Trigger } Prep NP { Tissue } }

Fig. 1. Patterns for ﬁnding angiogenesis terms and events.

2.3 Pattern matching with syntactic relation

The patterns B and C deﬁned in Section 2.2 are rather strict in that a trigger
and a tissue must follow the designated word order to form an angiogenesis
event. An angiogenesis event. however, can be expressed in many ways in
text and the tissue and trigger may not follow a speciﬁc word order. For
example, as shown in Figure 2. ‘endothelial cells that migrate to” can be an
angiogenesis event. where ‘endothelial cell” is a tissue entity and ‘migrate” a
trigger. However. neither pattern B nor C would identify the event. because
the trigger ‘migrate” appears in a relative clause.

One solution is to generalize patterns (B) and (C) in Figure 1 so that
a syntactically related pair of tissue and trigger can be considered to be an
angiogenesis event. We can employ a natural language parser to ﬁnd syntactic
relations between words. In our experiments. we used the ENJ U HPSG
parser (Miyao and Tsujii. 2008). which has been shown to yield good results
on ﬁnding proteiniprotein interactions (Miyao et al., 2009) and species
disambiguation (Wang et al., 2010). among other biomedical information
extraction tasks. ENJ U analyzes sentences and generates predicateiargument
structures (PASS), each of which consists of a predicate, an argument and a
relation between them. Figure 2 shows a phrase parsed by ENJU. where each
arrowed line and the words it connects denote a PAS, and the direction of the
line is from the predicate to the argument. For example, predicate ‘migrate”,
argument ‘cells” and relation ‘verb_arg1” form a PASS.

A sentence parsed by ENJU can be represented as a graph, in which each
node maps to a word and each edge to a PAS relation between the words.
As shown in Figure 3. we deﬁne that, if the ﬁrst node on a syntactic path is
a tissue term. and the last node a trigger. then the sequence of words on this
path is tagged as an event, and vice versa. Using pattern (B’) in Figure 3.
the example shown in Figure 2 will be recognized as an event. because
trigger word ‘migrate” and tissue ‘endothelial cells” are connected via the
syntactic path ‘mi grate”. ‘cells” and ‘endothelial”. When constructing events
with paths, the direction of PAS was not taken into account. and we also set
the maximum number of edges allowed on a path to 5.

We also expanded the vocabularies by including the derivation forms of
the tissues and triggers, because they appear in text not only as one POS.
but also others with the same lexical root. For example, both ‘vascular
development” and ‘develops vasculature” are angiogenesis events. where
‘vascular” is an adjective derivation of ‘vasculature” and ‘development” a
noun derivation of ‘develop”. We used the Lexical Variants Generation Tool
from NIH (http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lvg/current/
web/) for generating the derivations.

2.4 Automatic vocabulary construction using
domain-speciﬁc documents

In addition to the syntactic patterns. the tissue and trigger vocabularies

play an important role in the dictionary-based approach. The vocabularies

used in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 were manually developed. where the choice

of terms can be subjective and highly dependent on the curator”s domain

knowledge. In an attempt to alleviate this problem. we adopted a method

prep_arg 12

Automatic extraction of angiogenesis bioprocess from text

 

to automatically populate the vocabularies using domain-speciﬁc texts. This
approach requires little human input. because domain-speciﬁc documents
are relatively easy to obtain. For example, the review articles in the Nature
special issue on angiogenesis (DeWitt, 2005) and the Wikipedia page on this
subject (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis) are readily available as
angiogenesis-related texts.

Compared with other knowledge sources. domain-speciﬁc texts have
received less attention for their applications to biomedical text mining. One
application is keyphrase extraction. which can be cast as a classiﬁcation task
(Frank et al. 1999; Turney, 1999): each phrase in a document is either a
keyphrase or not. and the problem is to correctly classify a phrase into one
of the two categories, for which off-the-shelf supervised machine learning
tools can be used. However. this method requires a set of training documents.
where the keyphrases in each document must be manually identiﬁed.
Alternatively, previous work tackled keyphrase extraction using statistical
measures (e.g. Frantzi et al., 2000) using a single corpus. In contrast, our
method extracts salient angiogenesis-related predicateiargument pairs by
comparing the statistical language models built respectively on the PAS
generated from two ENJU-parsed corpora: a domain-speciﬁc corpus (i.e.
foreground corpus) and a general one (i.e. background corpus). Intuitively.
angiogenesis-related tissues and trigger words occur more frequently in the
foreground corpus than in the background one, and therefore it is possible
to extract these terms from the key predicateiargument pairs. Using the
patterns deﬁned in Section 2.3. the automatically generated tissue and trigger
vocabularies can then be used to construct angiogenesis events.

2.4.1 Capturing domain-speciﬁc keyphrases by comparing language
models A statistical language model assigns a probability to a sequence
of n words P(w1,...,w,,) by means of a probability distribution. In NLP, a
simplifying assumption is often made such that the probability of a word
given all the previous words can be approximated by the probability of
the word given a number of previous words. For example, a bigram model
approximates P(wi|wi_l) by the conditional probability of the preceding
word P(wi|wi_1), and similarly. a trigram model is the conditional probability
of the preceding two words. i.e. P(wi|wi_1wi_2).

Tomokiyo and Hurst (2003) approached keyphrase extraction by
comparing the KL divergence between the language model of a foreground
corpus, and that of a background one, where KL divergence is a non-
symmetric metric of the inefﬁciency of assuming that the distribution is
(1 when the true distribution is p (Cover and Thomas, 1991). Let p(x) and
q(x) be two probability mass functions. the KL divergence between p and q
is deﬁned in Equation (1).

1706)
D(p| lq) ;p(x>log gm (1)
They also deﬁned the term inside the summation of Equation (1) as point-
wise KL divergence. as shown in Equation (2). Intuitively. point-wise KL
divergence quantiﬁes the contribution of the phrase w to the expected loss
of the entire distribution.
17(w)
t3w(l7||11)=l7(W)10g — (2)
WV)
Tomokiyo and Hurst went on to score each n-gram in text according to its
‘phraseness” and ‘informativeness”. where the former computes how much
information would be lost if assuming the independence of each word by
applying the unigram model, instead of the n-gram one, and the latter is how
much we lose information by assuming w is drawn from the background
model instead of the foreground one. More formally, ‘phraseness” and
‘informativeness” are respectively deﬁned in Equations (3) and (4):

5w(LM}‘gIILM}g) (3)
ML y'c‘gllLMZg) (4)
where.
LM= H p(w,»iw,-> (5)
i={1,...,n}
j={1,. ,n}

and LMJ’.‘g is the n-gram model constructed from the foreground corpus, while
LM;g from the background one. The linear addition of ‘phraseness” and
‘informativeness” was used to score each n-gram, and the higher the score.
the more salient the n-gram is in the foreground corpus. This strategy was
shown to outperform some other keyphrase extraction methods, such as the
likelihood ratios (Damerau. 1993).

This method could be used to ﬁnd angiogenesis-related n-grams, given
an angiogenesis-speciﬁc corpus and a general one. However. tissues and
triggers are likely to contain one to several words. and calculating point-
wise KL divergence for every n-gram, where. for example, ne[1,4], is
computationally expensive. More importantly, by deﬁnition, n-gram models
only take into account strings of adjacent words. whereas as argued in Section
2.3. statistics of co-occurrences of words that are physically distant but
syntactically close can be very useful to capture related concepts.

2.4.2 Comparing language models based on PAS relations We also
extract keyphrases by comparing language models computed on different
corpora. However. instead of using n-gram language models, we adopted a
language model based on pair-wise predicateiargument relations produced
by the ENJU parser. There has been some research in incorporating syntactic
and semantic relations produced by a natural language parser in language
modelling. For example, Pado and Lapata (2007) built semantic vector space
models using word syntactic relations. instead of word co-occurrence counts.
and the models were shown to be comparable or superior to the state of the art.
on single word priming. synonym detection and word sense disambiguation.

When using the PAS-based language models, ‘phraseness” became
irrelevant because the parser would have determined the relation between
the predicate and argument. Consequently. we only needed to calculate the
‘informativeness” of each argument and predicate pair (i.e. n22), using
Equation (4). where W,’ and wj, respectively, are an argument and a predicate,
which have a direct PAS relation. as opposed to two neighbouring words as
in a bi-gram language model.

In our experiments. the background corpus contained 1000 documents
that were randomly selected from the collection of MEDLINE abstracts
published between year 2000 and 2010. As to the foreground corpus, we
experimented with three different document sets, in order to study how
‘domain-speciﬁc” a foreground corpus needed to be. The ﬁrst foreground
corpus (i.e. RANDOMMEDLINE) consisted of 250 randomly selected MEDLINE
documents (~52k tokens) that contain the keyword ‘angiogenesis”. The
second (i.e. ANGIOCORPUS) was the 262 abstracts in our angiogenesis corpus
(~58k tokens). retrieved using the patterns deﬁned in Section 2.2. Note that
in this experiment. we only used the ‘raw” text but not the annotation (Section
2.5). Finally, the third corpus (i.e. REVIEWARTICLES) contained the six full-
text review articles from the angiogenesis special issue of Nature (DeWitt,
2005) and the Wikipedia page on angiogenesis (~53k tokens).

The background and foreground corpora were processed by ENJU to
generate the PAS relations. and then the PAS-based language models were
computed for each corpus, where Katz smoothing (Katz, 1987), reportedly
to perform well on NLP tasks (Chen and Goodman, 1996), was applied
to alleviate the data sparseness problem, and functional words such as
prepositions and determiners, as well as words consisting of only digits and
punctuation. were removed.

We then coupled each foreground corpus with the background one, and
extracted a list of salient predicateiargument pairs using Equation (4).
and the pairs were ranked according to their point-wise KL divergence
scores. To assess the quality of the results. a domain expert manually
reviewed the highest ranked 50 predicateiargument pairs. extracted using
REVIEWARTICLES as the foreground corpus. In this exercise, an argument7
predicate pair was judged as relevant if it was either an angiogenesis-related
entity (i.e. cell. tissue, gene or gene product) or an angiogenesis term or
event. The result was promising: 32 phrases were judged as relevant and
12 possibly relevant. In other words, 88% of the automatically extracted
argumentipredicate pairs were relevant or possibly relevant. In addition, all
phrases in the top 20 were considered relevant (14 out of 20) or possibly

relevant (6 out of 20). Table 2 shows the top 10 angiogenesis-related
predicateiargument pairs extracted in this experiment.

2.4.3 Event extraction The automatically extracted list contains
angiogenesis-related predicateiargument pairs, but in order to construct
patterns for mining events as described in Section 2.3. we needed to
acquire the vocabularies for tissue terms and trigger words. We consider a
term as a tissue if it satisﬁes the following two conditions: (i) it belongs
to a tissue dictionary; and (ii) it occurs in the predicateiargument list.
Essentially, the conditions state that we want tissues (i.e. condition
1) that are relevant to the angiogenesis bioprocess (i.e. condition 2).
We constructed the tissue dictionary using a subset of the UMLS
ontology (http://http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/uml5/), which contains
the following branches: body. body parts, organ, tissue. cell and cell
components. UMLS was chosen because it is relatively comprehensive
and integrated a number of biomedical ontology and vocabularies,
such as MeSH (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) and NCI thesaurus
(http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/). We ‘ﬂattened” the dictionary so that it did not
contain any hierarchy, and the ﬁnal tissue dictionary contained 188069
unique entries. Meanwhile, according to condition 2. a term must also
match an argument or a predicate, which ranks among the top 01 (01:500 in
our experiments) in the predicate-argument list. Note that a tissue entity can
appear as either a predicate or an argument. For example, both ‘vascular”
and ‘vasculature” are angiogenesis tissue entities, but the former is more
likely to be a predicate as an adjective. whereas the latter, a noun, is more
likely to be an argument.

Similarly, a trigger word is a verb that appears in the salient predicatei
argument list. We needed a verb dictionary and for that purpose we examined
lexical resources for the biological domain such as BioLexicon (Sasaki et al.,
2008a). The coverage of the verb list in BioLexicon is small and does not
include angiogenesis trigger words such as ‘proliferate” and ‘mi grate”. On the
other hand. verbs in English dictionaries. such as WordNet, are too general.
We then decided to build a verb dictionary by computing point-wise KL
divergence scores for verb unigrams using Equation (4). on the foreground
and background corpora, where n was set to 1 and w must be a verb as
identiﬁed by a POS tagger (Alex et al., 2008). The verb list was then expanded
to include the derivation forms using the NIH Lexical Variants Generation
Tool. Finally, the top-ranked [3 terms ([3 =150 in our experiments) in the
intersection of the verb list and the predicateiargument list were selected as
angiogenesis trigger words.

We then tagged angiogenesis events in text using the patterns deﬁned in
Figure 3. The only difference is that Tissue and Trigger were taken from
the automatically constructed tissue and trigger lists. respectively, instead
of the manually created ones. See the additional material to this article
(http://text0.mib.man.ac.uk/~mbassxw2/angiogenesis/additional.html) for
more discussion on how the parameters 01 and 13 affect the event extraction
performance.

2.5 Learning from manual annotation

A supervised learning approach infers a model over training examples. where
each example consists of a set of predeﬁned features (e.g. word form and
contextual information) and an output value. The trained model is then

used to classify new instances. Supervised systems consistently excel as
demonstrated in a range of evaluation challenges. such as BioCreative I
(Hirschman et al., 2005) and II (Krallinger et al. 2008b) and the BioNLP
shared tasks (e.g. Kim et al., 2009). Such methods do not rely on dictionaries.
However. the availability of a training corpus is essential and therefore we
hand-built a gold standard corpus for the identiﬁcation of angiogenesis terms
and events. In addition to training machine learning models, the corpus
enabled systematic evaluation and comparison of the techniques proposed
in this article.

2.5.1 Selecting documents for manual annotation We ﬁrst retrieved an
initial pool of documents from the collection of MEDLINE abstracts that were
published on and before October 2009. The patterns deﬁned in Figure 1
were submitted as queries. More speciﬁcally, if an abstract contains a
sentence that matches pattern (A). (B) or (C) (Fig. 1). then it will be
retrieved and stored in the pool. We did not only use angiogenesis terms (e.g.
‘angiogenesis”) as queries, because documents that contain angiogenesis
events were also of interest. We then randomly selected abstracts in several
batches for annotation and in total the ﬁnal annotated corpus contained 262
abstracts. Note that this retrieval procedure gave some advantage to the
dictionary-based approach described in Section 2.2 in evaluation, because
each document was guaranteed to contain at least an angiogenesis term or
event that the dictionary-based method would be able to identify.

2.5.2 Manual annotation Table 1 summarizes the annotation markables.
The guidelines for annotating entities (i.e. gene or gene product, tissue and
cell) and angiogenesis terms were relatively straightforward: every mention
of the above entities should be annotated. and a mention of an entity can be
either its full-name or abbreviation and acronym forms. As for angiogenesis
events. we followed the deﬁnitions set in Section 2.1 and annotated the
phrases that indicated the change of state of angiogenesis-related cells.
cell components and tissues. Similar to GENIA”s annotation (Kim et al.,
2009), each event should contain a tissue term as a participant, and a trigger
word indicating the action that changes the state of the participant or its
biological property. Although this rule was not enforced due to limitation of
the annotation tool, we found the majority of events contain a participating
tissue entity (463 out of 479. or 97%). and those that do not have participants
were mostly annotation errors. Different from the GENIA guidelines. a
participating entity may consist of words of any POS. and triggers were
not explicitly marked, in order to reduce annotation time. Table 3 shows
two examples that illustrate the difference in our annotation and GENIA”s.
For the ﬁrst example, we annotated phrase ‘endothelial cell migration” as an
angiogenesis event and ‘endothelial cell” a cell entity. whereas according to
the GENIA guidelines. ‘endothelial cell migration” would be marked as a
‘cellular physiological process” event, ‘endothelial cell” as a cell entity and
‘mi gration” a trigger word. As to the second example, GENIA annotators
would not add any annotation. while we would annotate ‘vascular” as a
tissue entity. ‘vascular proliferation” as one, and ‘vascular maturation” as
the other event.

Our annotation guidelines also stated that the annotation was concerned
with identifying what the author(s) intend to communicate in the text. and the
annotators should not make any judgment as to the validity of the author”s
claims. During the annotation. the annotators may seek help from external
resources and search engines. such as PubMed and Google. Also, when
marking the entities and events. the annotators were permitted to nest them,
but neither entities nor events were allowed to cross. Discontinuous co-
ordinations such as ‘A and B cells” were annotated as two nested entities ‘A
and B cells” and ‘B cells”. Three domain experts went through the abstracts
and annotated angiogenesis terms, events and related bioentities. The
annotation was carried out using the Callisto tool (http://callisto.mitre.org/)
for its relative simplicity to use. In total, ~150 h was spent on annotation.

2.5.3 Quality control To ensure the quality of annotation. we ﬁrst went
through a ‘pilot study” , in which 20 documents were doubly annotated. Inter-
annotator agreement (IAA) for every type of markable was then calculated.
The IAA results of angiogenesis terms were good (Table 4), indicating
the annotators consistently agreed with each other. However. the IAA for
angiogenesis events was not satisfactory (Table 5), which demonstrated the
complexity and diversity in how angiogenesis events appear in text. and the
fact that the task can be a challenge even for human annotators.

Nevertheless, we endeavored to improve the annotation consistency.
During the pilot study. we reconciled the doubly annotated documents.
found the causes of the discrepancies and re-emphasized the aforementioned
annotation guidelines. Then the three annotators started two rounds of
annotation. where 100 documents were annotated in the ﬁrst round and
150 in the second. Double annotation was not performed in this phase
due to resource constraints. However. to ensure annotation quality. for each
document, a second annotator carried out validation after each round of
annotation. and if in doubt. the two annotators were asked to agree on
a gold standard through reconciliation. At the end of the annotation. two
annotators revisited the 20 doubly annotated documents used for pilot study
and updated the annotation. Then the reconciled 20 documents were added
to the gold standard dataset. In total, the annotation project generated 270
unique abstracts. However. eight of which were discarded, because they
were considered irrelevant to the domain, and consequently the ﬁnal corpus
contains 262 abstracts.

2.5.4 Supervised learning We tackled both the entity and event
recognition tasks with logistic regression models, which have been shown
to be effective in handling large-scale classiﬁcation problems (Andrew and
Gao. 2007). In addition, an attractive feature of logistic regression models
is that they produce probabilistic output that allows the information on
the conﬁdence of the decision to be used by subsequent components in
the text processing pipeline. When the random variable to predict is a
sequence. the logistic regression model is called linear chain Conditional
Random Fields (CRFS) (Lafferty. 2001). which has demonstrated good
results on a number of NLP tasks, ranging from POS tagging to chunking
(e.g. Tsuruoka et al., 2009). In our experiments. we used CRFSuite
(http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/). a fast implementation of CRF.
for tagging the angiogenesis terms and events. In more detail. we converted
the data to IOB2 representation (Rarnhsaw and Marcus, 1995), where words
that were not entities or events of interests received the tag 0. For the words
that formed an entity or event of semantic class x (e. g. angiogenesis event),
the ﬁrst word was tagged with B - x, and the remaining ones with I —x.

For tagging angiogenesis terms, we used the following features: unigram.
bigram and trigram to the left and right of the current word. whether the
current word was the head word of the current noun phrase, whether the
term was seen in a noun phrase in the document title.

For extracting angiogenesis events. we tested two feature settings: the
ﬁrst was the same as described above. and the second exploited the gold
standard annotation of genes. cells and tissues, in addition to the ﬁrst feature
set. These two settings respectively correspond to the CRF and CRF-entity
systems in Table 5. We used the gold standard entities to estimate whether
entity information was helpful for event identiﬁcation. In more detail. both
the semantic type and the text string of the gold standard entities were
incorporated as features for classiﬁcation. In practice. automatic systems
(e.g. Hanisch et al., 2005; Sasaki et al., 2008b; Wilbur et al., 2007) can be
used to generate the named entities. This way, the overall performance of
event extraction may decrease. However. in order to focus on examining
the performance of complex text mining tasks such as relation and event
extraction. in experiments. it is a common practice to assume previous
components produce gold standard annotations (e.g. Alex et al., 2008; Kim
et al., 2009).

3 EVALUATION AND RESULTS

The performance of the systems was measured by precision, recall
and Fl-score (i.e. balanced precision and recall). To be considered
correct, a system prediction must match not only the type of
the entity or event, but also both boundaries. For angiogenesis
events, sometimes boundaries are not crucial. For example, if
the gold standard is ‘vascular endothelial cell proliferation”, then
‘endothelial cell proliferation” is perhaps a good prediction, even if
its left boundary does not match the gold standard. Therefore, we
used an additional measure called approximate boundary matching,
which allows the spans of the predicted events to slightly differ from
the gold standard. A similar measure was also adopted in the BioNLP
event evaluation tasks (Kim et al., 2009).

Table 4 compares three sets of results for tagging angiogenesis
terms, where the CRF results were obtained by 5-fold cross-
validation on the manually created gold standard data. The CRF
model (Section 2.5.4) clearly outperformed DictionaryBased, which
uses the manually compiled dictionary of angiogenesis terms
(Section 2.2). Note that the IAA was calculated on a small set of
20 documents that were doubly annotated in the pilot annotation,
and therefore it was possible that system performance exceeded IAA
(Section 2.5.3).

Table 5 shows the results for angiogenesis event identiﬁcation.
Both PatternBaseline and PatternExtended exploited the manually

compiled tissue and trigger vocabularies, but the former performed
matches following simple patterns (Fig. 1), whereas the latter
applied patterns incorporating ENJU”s predicate—argument relations
(Fig. 2). PatternExtended was a clear winner over PatternBaseline,
which demonstrated that syntactic relations were useful. CRF and
CRF-entity were supervised methods, and they were trained and
tested by 5-fold cross-validation on the manually created corpus. As
mentioned, the difference between the two systems is that CRF used
only contextual word and n-gram as features, while CRF-entity also
exploited the gold stande entity annotation. CRF-entity obtained
the best results as measured by every metric, and the performance of
CRF was also promising. Nevertheless, the two methods were the
most expensive to develop, as they required high-quality training
data, which were laborious and time consuming to produce, even
though we signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed the annotation guidelines as
compared with other annotation projects such as GENIA.

The bottom three rows in Table 5 present the results of the
method that automatically constructs tissue and trigger vocabularies
by comparing PAS language models between a domain-speciﬁc
corpus and a general one (Section 2.4). We experimented with
three different domain-speciﬁc foreground corpora, and the distinct
performance indicates that this method is sensitive to the choice
of foreground corpus. The empirical results show that employing
the collection of the angiogenesis review articles and Wikipedia
page obtained the best results, which correlates with the fact that
this foreground corpus contained more concentrated information
regarding angiogenesis than the others. While using the manually
constructed vocabularies achieved good precision (87.71%), it
suffered from a poor recall (29.40%). On the other hand, the
automatic method using REVIEWARTICLES, yielded better recall and
F1 scores, indicating its ability to discover a wider range of terms
from the domain-speciﬁc documents.

4 CONCLUSIONS

This article presented solutions to a text mining task of automatically
extracting terms and events describing speciﬁc bioprocesses. We
examined angiogenesis, a bioprocess of blood vessel growth, and
manually created two types of resources to assist the study:
angiogenesis-related vocabularies and a gold stande corpus.
In particular, the gold stande corpus consists of 262 MEDLINE
abstracts, where angiogenesis terms and events, as well as genes,
gene products, cells and tissues, were manually annotated. The
statistics of the corpus shows that 36.5% of mentions of angiogenesis
appear in text as an event, which previous bioprocess extracting
techniques struggle to ﬁnd.

We developed and compared a range of methods using the
manually built vocabularies and gold standard corpus, and the
experimental results showed that a CRF model outperformed the
others: on detecting angiogenesis terms, it achieved an Fl-score of
92.8%; on event recognition, the model yielded an F1 of 64.79%
and a precision of 88.64%, when the restriction on event boundaries
was relaxed. Nevertheless, the CRF model relied on the manually
created gold standard, which domain experts spent 150 person/11 to
create. In contrast, the angiogenesis-speciﬁc vocabularies were less
time consuming to develop (40 person/h), but the pattern matching
approaches using the vocabularies obtained lower performance
results. We also proposed a new method that automatically discovers
angiogenesis-related tissue terms and trigger words, by comparing

the language models built on the predicate—argument relations
of two ENJU-parsed corpora: one contained angiogenesis-speciﬁc
documents and the other general biomedical texts. This method
required very little human supervision, and the pattern-based
systems achieved better results when using the automatically built
angiogenesis vocabularies than the manual ones. Overall, the relative
low development cost of this new method indicates that it has better
domain adaptability than the others, while achieving reasonable
performance results.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Given the current costs of next-generation sequencing,
large studies carry out low-coverage sequencing followed by applica-
tion of methods that leverage linkage disequilibrium to infer genotypes.
We propose a novel method that assumes study samples are
sequenced at low coverage and genotyped on a genome-wide micro-
array, as in the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). We assume poly-
morphic sites have been detected from the sequencing data and
that genotype likelihoods are available at these sites. We also
assume that the microarray genotypes have been phased to construct
a haplotype scaffold. We then phase each polymorphic site using an
MCMC algorithm that iteratively updates the unobserved alleles based
on the genotype likelihoods at that site and local haplotype informa-
tion. We use a multivariate normal model to capture both allele fre-
quency and linkage disequilibrium information around each site. When
sequencing data are available from trios, Mendelian transmission con-
straints are easily accommodated into the updates. The method is
highly parallelizable, as it analyses one position at a time.

Results: We illustrate the performance of the method compared with
other methods using data from Phase 1 of the 1KGP in terms of geno-
type accuracy, phasing accuracy and downstream imputation per-
formance. We show that the haplotype panel we infer in African
samples, which was based on a trio-phased scaffold, increases down-
stream imputation accuracy for rare variants (R2 increases by >0.05
for minor allele frequency <1%), and this will translate into a boost in
power to detect associations. These results highlight the value of
incorporating microarray genotypes when calling variants from
next-generation sequence data.

C++ program and is available from http://www.stats.ox.ac.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are known to be
well powered for the detection of common variants that increase
disease risk, and have uncovered many replicated associations
in recent years. However, the effect sizes of many associated

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

loci are relatively small and together explain only a small pro-
portion of the heritability for many diseases and traits. It has
been argued that rare variants with larger effects might harbour
the remaining genetic variability (Manolio et al., 2009).
Next-generation sequencing allows whole-genome sequencing
of a large sample of individuals so that a more detailed picture
of human polymorphism can be obtained. Projects such as the
1KGP (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are work-
ing to produce a catalogue of polymorphisms with low (minor
allele frequency [MAP] 6 [0.005, 0.05]) and rare (MAF<0.005)
allele frequencies.

The current analysis pipeline starts by detecting sites exhibiting
evidence of polymorphism. Genotypes are then called at the
polymorphic sites, and then haplotypes are estimated across all
such sites, often as a by-product of calling the genotypes. The
sets of haplotypes produced can be used as reference panels for
imputation into GWAS (Marchini and Howie, 2010) and allow
investigations of rare variant associations that go beyond previ-
ous imputation analyses from less complete reference panels such
as HapMap.

Given the current costs for sequencing, it is still not Viable
to deeply sequence a large number of individuals, so given a
fixed amount of resources, there is a trade-off between sample
size and coverage. The consensus View (Li et al., 2011; Kim et al.,
2010; The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) favours
low-coverage sequencing of large numbers of samples. For
example, the 1KGP will be sequencing ~2500 individuals at
~4x, the UKlOK project will sequence 4000 whole genomes
at ~6x (http://www.uk10k.org/), and the Genome of the
Netherlands is sequencing 750 individuals at ~l2x (http://
www.nlgenome.com/).

The current paradigm for detecting, genotyping and phasing
polymorphic sites from low-coverage sequence data starts by
mapping sequence reads to a reference genome. Mapped reads
that overlap a given site (3) in a single individual (i) are then
combined together to form genotype likelihoods (GLs). GLs
are the probabilities of observing the reads given the underlying
(unknown) genotype and can be written as P(R,-,,|G,~S), where R,,
and G,, denote the reads at site 3 and the true underlying geno-
type, respectively. Methods exist for calculating these GLs
(Li et al., 2009) and involve combining information about the
bases observed in reads, while allowing for the possibility of
sequencing errors Via base and mapping quality scores. So, for
example, if the set of reads only contains the A allele, then the
GL P(R,-S|G,-, 2 AA) will be larger than the other likelihoods, but
other genotypes will still have non-zero likelihood. As sequence

Genotype calling and phasing

 

coverage increases, the likelihoods should become more ‘peaked’
around the true genotype. In low-coverage sequencing, there
may be no reads spanning a site, in which case, the GLs will
be identical across all possible genotypes.

Detecting polymorphic sites involves combining information
across individuals at a site to infer whether there are at least
two alleles observed across all individuals in the sample
(Li et al., 2009). Once a site is detected, the site’s genotypes
can be called using a missing data likelihood that is optimised
Via an EM algorithm (Li et al., 2009), but this will only work well
when coverage is high and the GLs contain very good informa-
tion about the genotypes of all samples. When coverage is low,
power to call genotypes can be gained by taking advantage of
linkage disequilibrium (LD) between sites in close proximity.
Methods that do this are extensions of phasing and imputation
algorithms that pool information across samples and sites to
infer multi-site genotypes and their underlying haplotypes (e. g
IMPUTE2 [Howie et al., 2009], Beagle [Browning and
Browning, 2009] and MACH [Li et al., 2010]).

In some studies, such as GWAS, the individuals being
sequenced will also have been genotyped on a genome-wide
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. For example, in
the 1KGP, individuals are both sequenced and genotyped on
the Illumina OMNI2.5M chip. Some commercial vendors also
return GWAS array data with sequencing results, so this design
may become more prominent in the future. Up to now, chip
genotypes have primarily been used to validate sequencing-
based genotype calls, as the error rates of SNP chips are gener-
ally low (<0.5%) (O’Connell and Marchini, 2012).

In this article, we present a method that uses SNP chip geno-
types to aid the process of genotype calling from sequencing
reads. The ﬁrst step of our method involves estimating haplo-
types at the chip SNPs using an accurate phasing method
(Delaneau et al., 2011) to form a haplotype scaﬂold. We then
call genotypes at a polymorphic site using a model of the LD
between the site and the surrounding sites in the haplotype scaf-
fold. We use an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algo-
rithm that iteratively updates the unobserved alleles at a site
using the GLs and the local LD. We use a multivariate normal
model to capture both allele frequency and LD information
around each site that results in fast MCMC updates. When
sequencing data are available from motherifatherwhild trios,
Mendelian transmission constraints are easily accommodated
into the updates. The method analyses one position at a time
and results in a highly parallelizable method that can be applied
to a large sample. We call our method MVNcall.

Our approach is similar to the QCALL approach (Le and
Durbin, 2011), which also analyses one SNP at a time using a
haplotype scaffold. QCALL builds approximate coalescent trees
at each site and then infers phased genotypes by considering
possible mutations on branches of the trees. This approach
does not scale well as the number of sequences increases and is
the reason why this method was not applied to the Phase 1 of the
1KGP. MVNcall is much faster and has enabled us to analyse
the Phase 1 dataset.

In the sections that follow, we present in detail the underlying
model developed for genotype calling and phasing. We apply
our method and other methods to chromosome 20 of the
Phase 1 of the 1KGP. We carry out an imputation analysis

using the haplotype sets inferred by the different methods as
reference panels, and we compare imputation accuracy.

2 METHODS

We assume that sequencing reads on M individuals have been used to detect
a set of K polymorphic sites, with each site exhibiting two alleles. We use
0 and 1 to denote the reference and non-reference allele, respectively. For
each site s we assume that the three GLs P(R,;,|G,;, = 0), P(R,;,|G,;, = 1) and
P(R,;,|G,—Y = 2) have been pre-calculated. Our method processes each of
the K sites in turn. We estimate the phased genotypes at a single site (s)
using all the GLs and the haplotype scaffold at D SNPs either side of s.
We use H to denote the phased haplotype scaffold on the M individuals,
where H: {h11,h12, ...,hM1,hM2} and hi, denotes the jth haplotype of
the ith individual and is a sequence of 2D alleles hi]- ={h,-J-1...,h,-ﬂD}
with hi], 6 {0,1}. We use (h§1,hfuz) to denote the (unobserved) alleles of
the ith individual at site s so that the (unobserved) genotype
G, 2 kg + hf? The purpose of our method is to infer these unobserved
alleles in all M individuals so that we can construct the complete haplo-
types of each individual at the L=2D+1 sites, which we denote as
 = {1101, ...,hijD, hiJ'(D+1), ...

We have developed an MCMC algorithm to infer the unobserved a1-
leles. Starting from an initial conﬁguration of the alleles at site s, we cycle
through the individuals in random order and update their two unob-
served alleles. For the ith individual, the alleles are updated conditional
on (a) the reads Ris, (b) the haplotypes of that individual hi] and hi2, and
(c) the complete haplotypes of all individuals except individual i, which we
denote Hfi.

More speciﬁcally, the conditional distribution we use can be
written as

 a thNRiSa hi1: hi2:  (X P(Rir|Gi.Y)P(Gi.r|mia hi1:  

which makes the reasonable assumption that the reads R], are
conditionally independent of H2, hi] and ha given Gis. Further, we
specify that

P(GI-S|H=:i7

hi1, hrz) = P(h§1|hi1, Hii)P(hf2|hi21 Hg) (2)

which makes another reasonable assumption that the two alleles
(h?1 , h§2) are conditional independent given Hi,— and their respective ﬂank-
ing haplotypes hi] and ha. Figure 1 shows a pictorial representation
of this update. This approach of constructing a Gibbs sampler by directly
specifying conditional distributions is now standard in the ﬁeld of haplo-
type estimation. See Appendix A in the article by Stephens and Donnelly
(2003) for a discussion of why this approach is valid.

2.1 Modelling LD using a multivariate normal distribution

The only term of the model we need to specify is P(h§j|h,-J-,H’:i), and
this can be rewritten as

Put-mi. Hi.) oc Par? harm.) = Pug-rm.) (3)

I] I!"

where P(h§;|H’:,—) is the conditional distribution of a single haplotype h;-
given an observed set of other haplotypes Hfi. It is this distribution that
models the LD between the alleles at site s and the sites in the haplotype
scaffold. We use a multivariate normal model such that

Fig. 1. A pictorial representation of a single update of our MCMC
algorithm. In this example, there are six individuals with individual 6
being updated. The two unobserved alleles at the site s of individual 6
are denoted (h’gl,h’gz) (purple). These are ﬂanked by the haplotypes
(hm, kg) for individual 6 from the haplotype scaffold (orange). The set
of complete haplotypes of the other ﬁve individuals (Hfé) are high-
lighted. These haplotypes combine the remaining haplotypes from the
haplotype scaffold (blue) and the current estimates of the unobserved
alleles in the ﬁve individuals (green). The genotype likelihoods for unob-
served genotype G6, 2 kg, + h’gz are shown below the plot. Our method
updates (h’gl, h’gz) by sampling alleles using Eq. 1. We iterate this scheme
over all individuals in random order. Updating all individuals once
represents a single iteration

where IL is a L-vector of 1s, IL is the L-dimensional identity matrix, and
p. and Z are the sample mean and covariance matrix of the complete
haplotypes Hi,— given by

The sample mean p. is the vector of allele frequencies at the L sites in
Hi,— and 6 is a small constant deﬁned as in the article by Wen and
Stephens (2010). The sample covariance Z captures LD information
between the L sites, but because sites can be in perfect LD, we adjust
the covariance by a small amount (AIL) (Tychonoff, 1943). This ensures
that the covariance matrix f) is invertible, which is an operation we need
to carry out when using this model. These adjustments essentially capture
the idea that a given haplotype may contain unobserved variation not
seen in H2.

Good computational efﬁciency of the MCMC updates can be achieved
by taking advantage of the fact that the haplotype scaffold is ﬁxed and
not updated at each iteration. Our use of a multivariate normal model
implies that the conditional distribution in Eq. 3 is a univariate normal
distribution given by

where we use notation 0,, to denote the element of ti corresponding to the
site s that is being phased and ﬁr, to denote all the other L71 elements
of j). that correspond to sites in the haplotype scaffold ﬂanking site s.
Similarly, we use is", to denote the marginal variance of site s, $21,, 1,,
to denote the covariance of the Lil haplotype scaffold sites and
is, 1,, = fins to denote the vector of L71 covariances between site s
and the sites in the haplotype scaffold ﬂanking site s. The key point
here is that the inverse it; is and mean vector pr, need only be calcu-
lated once at the beginning, of the algorithm, and this results in efﬁcient
updates. Moreover, we set values in the inverse covariance matrix
less than a threshold to 0, and we use a Yale representation of the result-
ing sparse matrix to speed up the computations (Golub and Van Loan,
1996).

Other approaches, such as IMPUTE (Marchini et al., 2007) and
MACH (Li et al., 2010), use hidden Markov models to model a given
haplotype as an imperfect mosaic of the set of other observed haplotypes
and capture LD between sites. Our approach is simpler and results in
fast updates. One notable feature of our method is that it uses a continu-
ous distribution to model the discrete probability mass function that is
P(h§j|h,-j, HE). A similar model to ours has recently been shown to pro-
vide good performance for imputing unobserved allele frequencies and
individual-level genotypes from summary or pooled data (Wen and
Stephens, 2010).

2.2 MCMC algorithm as pseudo-code

Pseudo-code for our method is given as follows

(i) Initialize the alleles (h§1,hfuz)i e {1, ...,M} using a single-site
expectation-maximization algorithm (see Supplementary
Material)

(ii) Set n: 1; While n 5 N do

(a) Select a random ordering of individuals, denoted O.
(b) Forie {1, ...,M} do

(c) Sample new alleles (haphaz) by sampling from the condi-
tional distribution given in Eq. 1. When updating individual i
we store the conditional probabilities

((11,112) = 7:

where a1, a2 6 {0, 1}

(iii) We discard the ﬁrst B iterations as burn-in and calculate the
mean marginal posterior probabilities of each individual’s
phased alleles using a RaoiBlackwellised estimator as

N

The final phased set of alleles is chosen to maximise these mar-
ginal posterior distributions.

(iv) Once all sites have been processed, the phased alleles at each site
can then be placed into the haplotype scaffold at the appropriate
location, resulting in a complete phased haplotype reference
panel.

2.3 Parameter settings

MVNcall requires the user to set four parameters N, B, A and D. We have
investigated the sensitivity of the methods to variations in these param-
eters using the 1KGP dataset to derive a set of default parameters.

We carried out a convergence analysis of the MCMC algorithm to
determine how many burn-in and sampling iterations produce stable
results (see Supplementary Material). We varied both the number of

 

112 /310's112u1n0fp10}x0"soiJBuiJOJuioiq/ﬁduq moi; papeolumoq

Genotype calling and phasing

 

iterations N e {0, 10, 50, 100, 200} and burn-in iterations B e {10, 50,
100} to check convergence. Overall we observed that algorithm converges
quickly. For the analyses that follow, we ran the method for N: 100
iterations with B: 10 burn-in iterations.

As we increase the value of A, we increase the variance of the SNP sites
being modelled, and thus ‘ﬂatten’ the conditional distribution of a haplo-
type given the current conditioning set. This reduces the relative amount
of LD information utilised when calling genotypes at the site of interest
and increases the relative amount of information from the GLs. Using the
data from the 1KGP, we tested different values of A, ranging from (0.04,
0.08) with increments of 0.01, and we measured the genotype discordance
on a subset of sites for which external data are available. We reached a
minimum genotype discordance for A = 0.06, and this value is used in all
subsequent experiments.

We also ran our analysis of the 1KGP data using values of D e {20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80} and found that there was little added beneﬁt beyond
D = 50 (data not shown). This setting corresponds roughly to a window
of all SNPs within 60 kb of the site of interest, and this forms our
recommended setting for this parameter.

2.4 Method extensions

When using this method to call genotypes in large samples such as the
1KGP data, we found that the method’s speed and accuracy could be
improved by modifying the algorithm in the following three different
ways.

2.4.1 Weighted surrogate family phasing Rather than update
the ith individual’s genotype given all of the haplotypes in H2, we
only use a subset of haplotypes that most closely match the current
haplotype estimates of the individual (Howie et al., 2009). This approach
is called the “surrogate family” phasing approach, as it is a generalisation
of the surrogate parent phasing approach of Kong et al. (2008). This
method works well together with our use of a multivariate normal
model to capture local haplotype structure. By excluding haplotypes
with little relevant information to the individual being updated, the
estimates of allele frequency and covariance better capture the relevant
haplotype structure of the individual.

We investigated two different measures of haplotype similarity that are
used to identify the set of closest haplotypes of each individual. The ﬁrst
one is the Hamming distance (HD) metric used in IMPUTE2 (Howie
et al., 2009). The second metric is the perfect match distance (PMD),
deﬁned as the number of consecutive matches between two haplotypes,
commencing from the site of interest and counting to the right and to
the left of the position of interest. The PMD metric is not new in the
literature. It has been used in haplotype-sharing methods for association
studies under the assumption that individuals with similar phenotypes
carry similar chromosomal regions around the risk locus (Beckmann,
2010; Li and Jiang, 2005). For both of these metrics, we only measure
haplotype similarity using the scaffold sites. This has the advantage that
the relevant calculations can be carried out once at the start of the algo-
rithm and the set of haplotypes used by each individual is then ﬁxed
throughout the run of the MCMC method.

We have observed that the genotype discordance rates on the real data-
sets we analyse in this article are lower for PMD than HD (Supplementary
Table S2). Breaking down the genotype discordance rate by genotype
class, the largest difference between the genotype discordance rates
are for the heterozygous genotypes. A possible advantage of the PMD
over the HD measure is the fact that it accounts for the position of the
site of interest in the window studied. As our model analyses one position
at a time and not a window of SNPs simultaneously, PMD accommodates
this information. The HD measure does not account for this, and it
gives equal weight to mismatches irrespective of distance from the site of
interest, which appears not to be ideal in our model.

In addition to choosing a subset of haplotypes for each individual, we
found that using the value of the similarity metric to weight each of the
haplotypes further improved performance (data not shown). We calculate
the weights by normalizing the PMD of the haplotype by the total sum of
PMD in the conditional set. The weights are used to calculate weighted
sample means and covariances in Equations 7 and 8.

2.4.2 Model averaging We also investigated the inﬂuence of the
number (k) of conditioning haplotypes. In our real data experiments,
we found that genotype discordance for homozygous genotypes decreases
as k increases. Whereas, for the heterozygous genotypes, the genotype
discordance reaches a minimum when k = 100 and then increases as we
increase the value of k (Supplementary Fig. S2). We subsequently found
that adopting a model averaging approach improves performance across
all genotype classes. We run the MCMC algorithm separately for the
different values of k and at the end of the two runs we calculate the
mean marginal posterior probabilities from the two runs from all non--
burn-in iterations. Thus, we take the mean posterior probabilities from
the two runs, giving equal weight to the two runs.

2.4.3 Incorporating trio information for genotype calling The
model presented previously assumes that the individuals in the study are
unrelated. In the case where the individuals are related, this information
can be incorporated in the model to aid genotype calling and phasing.
We have extended the method for the analysis of low-coverage sequence
data on motherifatherwhild trios. The details of this method and a
full comparison of its performance are included in the Supplementary
Material.

2.5 Genotype accuracy comparisons

To assess the accuracy of the method in terms of both genotype calling
and phasing, we applied the method on 1092 individuals on chromosome
20 from Phase 1 of the 1KGP. These samples came from 14 distinct
population groups (see Supplementary Table Sl). The average sequence
coverage per individual is in the range 276x. The GLs were produced
with SNPTools (http://www.hgsc.bcrn.trnc.edu/cascade-tech-software_
snp_tools-tihgsc). For the scaffold, we used phased genotype data col-
lected on these individuals using the Illumina Omni2.5M microarray
(OMNI2.5). The genotype data on these samples are a subset of a dataset
of 2123 individuals genotyped on this chip, which consists of 327 motheri
fatherwhild trios, 42 parentwhild duos and 1058 unrelated samples.
Supplementary Table Sl lists how many trios, duos and unrelated sam-
ples there are in each population. The phasing software SHAPEIT
(Delaneau et al., 2011) was used to phase the OMNI2.5 genotypes and
create the haplotype scaffold of our method. This method used the trio
and duo information to improve the phasing. On chromosome 20, this
dataset consisted of 54 241 SNPs in the scaffold. We ran our method
using D: 50 ﬂanking sites in the scaffold each side of every site being
called, and for two different values of conditioning haplotypes, one with
100 conditioning haplotypes and the second with all available haplotypes
in the reference panel. We analysed samples in three continental groups
plus the samples from admixed populations groups. The combinations
are Asian and Admixed, European and Admixed and African and
Admixed (see Supplementary Table Sl). In the case of the Admixed
individuals, the posterior genotypes from the African and Admixed run
were used.

We make comparisons with three other methods that have been
applied on the same dataset, Beagle, Thunder (MaCH) and SNPTools.
Beagle, Thunder and our method provided results for all 1092 individ-
uals, whereas SNPTools provided results for only 1041 individuals. Our
comparisons are based on the set of 1041 individuals common to all four
call sets. The genotype calls made by Thunder and SNPTools are
obtained from the 1KGP website. We ran Beagle ourselves by dividing

the chromosome into 3-Mb chunks with 200-kb overlap and using the
default parameters.

A subset of 601 individuals were present in HapMap3 (International
HapMap 3 Consortium, 2010) and a subset of 591 individuals were
also genotyped on an Affymetrix Axiom chip. We thus compared the
genotype call sets from the four methods to the genotypes in these two
datasets. In these comparisons, we excluded sites on the OMNI2.5 chip
because our method assumes that these genotypes are ﬁxed. There were
18 155 sites in the HapMap3 dataset that were not on the OMNI2.5 chip.
There were 85 858 sites in the Axiom dataset that were not on the
OMNI2.5 chip. The 591 HapMap3 individuals consisted of 160 with
European ancestry, 167 with Asian ancestry, 162 with African ancestry
and 102 with Admixed ancestry. The 601 Axiom individuals consisted of
167 with European ancestry, 162 with Asian ancestry, 165 with African
ancestry and 107 with Admixed ancestry.

A subset of 170 Phase 1 samples were present in the HapMap3 dataset
as trios and were phased in the HapMap3 dataset using this trio infor-
mation. Of these samples, 112 were also present on the OMNI2.5 chip as
trios and duos and the remaining 58 were present on OMNI2.5 as unre-
lated. Therefore, we can use the HapMap3 haplotypes to assess the ac-
curacy of the haplotypes produced by our method in samples phased
using related and unrelated samples. This comparison highlights the
value of using a trio/duo-based scaffold in our method. We measured
haplotype accuracy using the switch error rate (Delaneau et al., 2011).

We also examined the effect of reducing the SNP density of the haplo-
type scaffold on the genotype accuracy. The details and results are
described in full in the Supplementary Material and show that in popu-
lations with lower levels of LD, a denser scaffold is needed to preserve
good genotype accuracy. We also used high-coverage sequencing data on
a motherifatherichild trio to assess genotype concordance and phasing
accuracy using the extension of our method to allow for trio information.
A full description of these experiments and the results are given in the
Supplementary Material.

2.6 Imputation accuracy comparisons

We assessed the quality of the haplotype reference panels produced by
MVNcall, Beagle, Thunder and SNPTools by using them as the basis for
imputing genotypes into new samples. We used new samples that had
been deeply sequenced (at 80x on average) by Complete Genomics
(http://www.completegenomics.com/public-data/). Genotypes from such
deeply sequenced samples will be accurate. After excluding the individuals
who were present in Phase 1, 16 individuals came from three of the
population groups of the 1KGP Phase 1 samples. More speciﬁcally,
nine individuals had African ancestry, four individuals had European
ancestry and three individuals had Mexican ancestry. For this analysis,
we created four test datasets consisting only of genotypes at SNPs that
are present on the Affymetrix 500K, Affymetrix 6.0, Illumina HumanlM
and OMNI2.5M chips. We then imputed genotypes at SNPs not on the
various chips using the four different reference panels. We measured ac-
curacy of the imputed genotypes using the Complete Genomics genotypes
not present on the various chips. In the analysis based on chromosome
20, 324 907 non-Affymetrix 500K SNPs were imputed from 12238
Affymetrix 500K chip SNPs, 314138 non-Affymetrix 6.0 SNPs were
imputed from 23022 Affymetrix 6.0 chip SNPs, 311238 non-Illumina
HumanlM SNPs were imputed from 25939 Illumina HumanlM chip
SNPs and 289 837 non-OMNI2.5 SNPs were imputed from 47317
OMNI2.5 SNPs. SNPs where the alleles were different in the Complete
Genomics and 1KGP datasets were removed from the analysis. All the
imputation experiments were performed with IMPUTEV2 (Howie et al.,
2011) using the default parameters and by splitting chromosome 20 into
S-Mb non-overlapping regions.

We focused the comparison in terms of imputation accuracy on SNPs
with low and rare frequency variants, as such SNPs are a focus of much
attention in current GWAS (McCarthy et al., 2008). A standard measure

of imputation accuracy is the Pearson R2 correlation coefﬁcient, which
measures the correlation at each SNP between the true genotypes GET")
and the imputed dosages, deﬁned as Gfiydo‘m) 2 22:0 gP(G,;, = g) 6 [0,2].
However, the R2 metric behaves poorly in a setting where the sample size
is small. This is because when the true genotypes of the individuals are the
same for a given SNP, the R2 is undeﬁned. To avoid the problem of
calculating per-SNP metrics for small sample sizes, we divided the
imputed SNPs according to MAP, and then calculated an aggregate R2
over all genotypes within each frequency bin. When used on small sam-
ples, this measure has good correlation with mean per-SNP R2 in larger
samples (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012). The R2 measure
has direct relevance to the power of association studies, as the
non-centrality parameter of the test for additive association is directly
proportional to the R2 between a marker locus and a causal locus
(Chapman et al., 2003).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Genotype accuracy comparison

Table 1 compares the percentage genotype discordance of the
different methods on the HapMap3 dataset. The results are stra-
tiﬁed by continental group and by genotype classes: homozygous
reference genotypes (HomR), heterozygous genotypes (Het) and
homozygous alternative genotypes (HomA). We also report the
overall percent genotype discordance as well as the percent geno-
type discordance excluding the homozygous reference genotypes
(NonRef).

In the African and Admixed samples, MVNcall has the lowest
overall discordance rate (0.42%), which is mainly driven by the
difference in the genotype discordance on the homozygous geno-
types (0.19% for HomR and 0.57% for HomA), whereas the
other methods have HomR and HomA discordances above

0.23% and 0.60%, respectively. The NonRef discordance of
MVNcall is 0.04% higher than that of Thunder and SNPTools
owing to the higher Het discordance. MVNcall outperforms
Beagle by 0.17% on the Het discordance and achieves 0.09%
lower overall discordance and 0.13% lower NonRef discordance
rates.

For the Asian and European groups, overall genotype discord-
ance rates are lower for all methods, ranging from 0.23%
to 0.30% for the European group and from 0.26% to 0.31%
for the Asian group. Thunder achieves the lowest genotype dis-
cordance rates for the homozygous genotypes in these popula-
tion groups, where SNPTools outperforms all other methods on
calling heterozygous genotypes. MVNcall outperforms Beagle
in both the European and Asian groups. Similar patterns hold
when results are stratiﬁed into frequency bins MAF 5 3%, 3% <
MAF§5% and MAF>5% (Supplementary Tables S37S5).
Supplementary Tables S1LS19 report P-Values for tests of
equality between the overall discordance rates between all pairs
of methods on each dataset.

Table 2 compares the percentage genotype discordance of
the different methods on the Axiom dataset. The Axiom dataset
has ~4.7 times the number of SNPs and many more rarer
variants than the HapMap3 dataset, making this comparison
more relevant. Of the 85858 Axiom SNPs, there were 23040,
38890, 11720 and 16208 SNPs with MAF <2.5% in the
African, Admixed, Asian and European groups, respectively.
Comparing Tables 1 and 2, we see that overall discordance
rates are higher in the Axiom dataset, driven by the larger
number of rarer SNPs, which are harder to call. MVNcall out-
performs other methods when calling homozygous genotypes
on the African and Admixed groups, and has the lowest overall

genotype discordance rate, tied with Thunder. Our method
seems to have elevated discordance rates for the heterozygous
genotypes at 1.36% compared with Thunder (1.17%) and
SNPTools (1.23%) in the African and Admixed group. Beagle
has the highest genotype discordance rates for heterozygous
genotypes. In terms of overall discordance rate, MVNcall and
Thunder have the lowest overall genotype discordance, followed
by SNPTools and Beagle, in the African and Admixed group.
In the Asian and European groups, the ranking of methods
is SNPTools/Thunder, MVNcall and Beagle. In terms of the
NonRef discordance rates, Thunder and SNPTools have the
lowest discordance rates, followed by MVNcall and Beagle.

Similar patterns hold when results are stratiﬁed into fre-
quency bins MAF§3%, 3% <MAF§5% and MAF>5%
(Supplementary Tables SGSS). Supplementary Tables S9 and
S10 show genotype discordance results for the Axiom and
HapMap3 comparisons, respectively, stratified by both popula-
tion and whether the individuals had scaffold genotypes phased
in trios, duos or as unrelated samples. There is some evidence
in these tables that genotypes called in samples that use a trio- or
duo-phased scaffold are more accurate than in samples that use a
scaffold phased with no family information. For example, overall
discordance rates in 73 Yoruban samples that use a trio-phased
scaffold and 75 Luhya samples that use an unrelated-phased
scaffold are 0.42 and 0.63% in the HapMap3 dataset and
0.63% and 0.74% in the Axiom dataset, respectively. The num-
bers of individuals used to calculate error rates in some cells
of these tables are not always large so it can be difﬁcult to
make ﬁrm conclusions.

The switch error rate of the haplotypes from the 112 Phase 1
samples called using a scaffold derived from trio and duos com-
pared with the trio-phased HapMap3 haplotypes from the
same samples was 0.89%. The switch error rate of the haplotypes
from the 58 Phase 1 samples called using a scaffold derived from
unrelated samples compared with the trio-phased HapMap3
haplotypes from the same samples was 2.65%. These results
highlight the value of using trio and duo information when
calling genotypes and estimating haplotypes from low-coverage
sequence data.

3.2 Imputation accuracy comparison

Figure 2 and Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 show the results
of our imputation accuracy comparisons when imputing from
genotypes on the Affymetrix 500K chip (results from different
chips are given in Supplementary Figs S&S7). On the x-axis we
plot the non-reference allele frequency (AF) of the imputed SNPs
on the log scale and on the y-axis the aggregate R2.

For the European group (Supplementary Fig. S3), SNPTools
has the highest aggregate R2 for rare SNPs compared with the
other methods, which are close in performance across all fre-
quencies. For the individuals with African ancestry, MVNcall
clearly outperforms the other methods (Fig. 2), especially on
SNPs with AF <0.05. The method increases aggregate R2 by
>0.05 for SNPs with AF <0.005 compared with the three other
methods. This increase in R2 will translate into an increase in
power of association studies that interrogate rare variants. This
pattern remains stable for all the three Affymetrix 6.0, Illumina
HumanlM and OMNI2.5M imputation scaffolds. For the

4 DISCUSSION

Our proposed model for genotype calling and phasing assumes
a study design where samples have been both sequenced and
genotyped. The 1KGP uses exactly this design and this was a
major motivation for developing such an approach. In addition,
many cohorts of samples from GWAS have been genotyped
using microarray chips, and it is likely that these samples
might be sequenced in the future, providing a combined set of
data that also fits in with our approach. In fact, some commer-
cial vendors also return GWAS array data with sequencing
results. The genotyped data from the microarrays can be fed
into a phasing algorithm, and the resulting haplotypes serve as
a haplotype scaffold in our model so that LD information
between the scaffold sites and non-scaffold sites can be utilised.
To capture this LD information, we use an approximate model
that summarises the allele frequencies and the pairwise correl-
ation between SNPs using a multivariate normal distribution.
There is an increasing body of literature that the use of a
normal distribution can capture enough information about cor-
relations in alleles both between SNPs and between individuals
to provide useful levels of inference (Nicholson et al., 2002; Coop
et al., 2010; Wen and Stephens, 2010). Future extensions might
utilise a normal approximation to efﬁciently call genotypes
from low-coverage sequencing data together with a haplotype
reference panel (Pasaniuc et al., 2012) and without a haplotype
scaffold. Our model would also be relatively easy to extend
to other types of polymorphism such as indels and multi-allelic
variants. Utilising phase informative reads when constructing

haplotype panels from sequence data may also prove to be
beneﬁcial (He et al., 2012).

When applied to data from Phase 1 of the 1KGP that include
1092 individuals from 14 distinct population backgrounds
sequenced at 4x and genotyped on the OMNI2.5M chip, we
find that our method outperforms Beagle in all population
groups in terms of genotype accuracy. This is an interesting
result because MVNcall analyses one site at a time rather than
all sites jointly as in Beagle. It may be argued that jointly model-
ling all sites at once is a more appropriate strategy because this
approach utilises LD information between all the sites being
called. On the other hand, when the calling of genotypes is dif-
ficult, which can be the case when sequence coverage is low, it
may be that the Beagle’s joint approach suffers from convergence
problems and the resulting haplotypes include errors due to this
problem. The methods SNPTools and Thunder also model all
sites jointly but perform slightly better than MVNcall on the
European and Asian comparisons. It may be that the underlying
models they use are much better than the model used in Beagle,
or that the computational strategies that they use do a better job
at avoiding convergence problems.

A major use of the haplotype panels produced by the 1KGP is
imputation of genotypes into GWAS. It was thus natural that
we assess the ability of MVNcall to produce haplotype panels
in terms of downstream imputation performance. A key finding
of this work is that the panel of haplotypes that we produce from
the 1KGP African samples results in a clear boost in down-
stream imputation performance at rare variants, when compared
with the haplotype panels produced by SNPTools, Thunder or
Beagle. MVNcall results in a 0.05 increase in mean R2 at rare
variants below 1% frequency when compared with other meth-
ods. This is a substantial boost in accuracy, as studies of rare
variants are in general less powerful. The R2 metric used for our
assessments has direct relevance to the power of such studies
(Chapman et al., 2003). In Admixed samples, MVNcall produces
similar results to SNPTools, and both these methods have better
performance than Thunder and Beagle at rare variants. We do
not see the same increase in imputation performance when
imputing European samples.

This may be because a substantial proportion (47%) of
African samples in the reference panel have a haplotype scaffold
that has been derived using trio phasing. We have shown that
the haplotypes our method constructs when using a trio-phased
scaffold have much lower switch error rate compared with the
haplotypes from a scaffold phased without family information.
It may be that it is this increase in haplotype accuracy that trans-
lates into a downstream effect on imputation performance.
In contrast, only 4.4% of the European haplotypes in the refer-
ence panel were derived from a trio-phased scaffold. Almost
85% of the Mexican samples in the haplotype reference panel
were derived using a trio-based scaffold, which might lead us to
expect that imputation in Mexican samples should be better
when using MVNcall reference haplotypes. The ancestry of
Mexican individuals derives mostly from Europeans and
Native Americans, with a small amount of African admixture.
Imputing Mexican samples will work well when all three of
these ancestries are well characterised in the reference panel.
It may be the case that Mexican haplotype reference set does
not provide a sufﬁcient characterisation of Native American

haplotype diversity across the genome and this degrades imput-
ation performance and drives the similarity between methods.
Imputation of rare variants in Mexican samples is noticeably
worse (Supplementary Fig. S4) than in the African and
European samples (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3).

Overall these results highlight the gains that can be made when
using microarray genotypes to improve genotype calls and phas-
ing using low-coverage sequence data. Future analysis of the
1000 Genomes Project data would benefit from fully incorporat-
ing the Illumina OMNI2.5M genotypes into the genotype calling
and haplotype estimation process.

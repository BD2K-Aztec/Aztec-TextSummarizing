Abstract

Summary: Transposable elements constitute a large fraction of vertebrate genomes and, during
evolution, may be co—opted for new functions. Exonization of transposable elements inserted
within or close to host genes is one possible way to generate new genes, and alternative splicing
of the new exons may represent an intermediate step in this process. The genes TMPO and
ZNF451 are present in all vertebrate lineages. Although they are not evolutionarily related, mam—
malian TMPO and ZNF451 do have something in common—they both code for splice isoforms that
contain LAP2alpha domains. We found that these LAP2alpha domains have sequence similarity to
repetitive sequences in non—mammalian genomes, which are in turn related to the first ORF from a
DIRS1—like retrotransposon. This retrotransposon domestication happened separately and resulted
in proteins that combine retrotransposon and host protein domains. The alternative splicing of the
retrotransposed sequence allowed the production of both the new and the untouched original
isoforms, which may have contributed to the success of the colonization process. The LAP2alpha—
specific isoform of TMPO (LAPZa) has been co—opted for important roles in the cell, whereas the

 

ZNF451 LAP2alpha isoform is evolving under strong purifying selection but remains

uncharacterized.

1 Introduction

Vertebrate genomes, like those of other eukaryotes, are largely consti—
tuted by transposable elements (TEs)—up to two—thirds of the human
genome according to a recent estimate (de Koning et (11., 2011). The
evolutionary history of TEs runs parallel to that of the host genome.
All life forms are endowed with mechanisms to defend against the
threat posed by the activity and expansion of TEs. Despite their
threatening character, many TEs have been co—opted for new func—
tions during evolutionary history, in what is considered a form of do—
mestication (Feschotte, 2008; Hoen and Bureau, 2012; Volff, 2006).
Some TEs have contributed non—coding regulatory sequences, whereas
others have given rise to new protein—coding genes.

Basically, there are two means of co—opting TEs into genes. First,
a TE (or part of one) may form a new whole gene. This is probably
what occurred with TERT, the telomerase of eukaryotes, which
probably originated from the reverse transcriptase (RT) of a non—
LTR retrotransposon (Lingner et (11., 1997). Alternatively, a TE can
insert within or close to a pre—eXisting gene and combine with it to
produce a new protein. This is what happened in the case of the his—
tone methyltransferase SETMAR in the ancestor of primates. Here,
a mariner—like DNA transposon inserted downstream of the SET
CDS producing an exon that combined with the original exons to
form a chimeric protein (SETMAR) with a new DNA—binding do—
main (Cordaux et (11., 2006).

The process of TE exonization has been studied thoroughly
(Cordaux and Batzer, 2009; Sela et al., 2010; Sorek, 2007). Many
TE—derived exons have been identified in the human genome, the
majority are fragments of Alu elements (Deininger, 2011). Most
Alu—derived exons are alternatively spliced, presumably because
their constitutive expression would be deleterious and is negatively
selected (Sorek et al., 2002). It has been proposed that the exoniza—
tion of TEs would have less deleterious effects if the exons were al—
ternative (Schmitz and Brosius, 2011; Xing and Lee, 2006), because
they would not disturb the production of the original isoforms and
alternative splicing would allow TEs to coexist in an intermediate
stage on the way to full TE co—option.

Most new TE exons appear in 5— or 3—prime UTRs and may play
regulatory roles (Sela et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2011). In contrast, TE
exonization in protein—coding regions generally produces short, lin—
eage—specific exons that appear as rare splice variants, questioning
their biological relevance and suggesting that most probably do not
translate into proteins (Gotea and Makalowski, 2006; Lin et al.,
2008; Pavlicek et al., 2002; Piriyapongsa et al., 2007).

Here, we investigate the likely TE origins of exons found in both
the ZNF451 and TMPO genes. These exons are found in the coding
regions of both genes, are alternatively spliced and there is ample
evidence of their expression as proteins. The exons are present in
mammalian orthologs of ZNF451 and TMPO, whereas they are ab—
sent in other vertebrates.

2 Methods

To identify genes with mutually exclusive protein domains, we
retrieved human transcripts from Ensembl (Cunningham et al.,
2014) that were annotated with CCDS support (Pruitt et al., 2009).
We took their Pfam annotations (Finn et al., 2014) and looked for
alternative transcripts with different Pfam domains that were mutu—
ally exclusively spliced. We identified 40 candidates, of which only
nine were retained after manual curation: MOCSZ, DST, XIRPZ,
CUXI, SP100, ZNF655, GNAS, VTN and ZNF451. Proteomics ex—
periments identified peptide support for alternative isoforms for
four of these genes (Ezkurdia et al., 2012).

Sequence similarity searches between the LAP2alpha domains
(from the TMPO and ZNF451 genes) and vertebrate genome se—
quences were carried out using TBLASTN, via the Ensembl web ser—
ver (Cunningham et al., 2014) or locally, in both cases using version
2.2.26 of the BLAST package (Altschul et al., 1997). RPS—
TBLASTN profile—based searches (v2.2.29) were performed against
the CDD database [version of October 2014 (Marchler—Bauer et al.,
2005)]. The Western painted turtle genome [v3.0.1 (Shaffer et al.,
2013)] was downloaded from UCSC (Rosenbloom et al., 2014).
Repeat annotations for the Chinese soft—shell turtle were obtained
from Ensembl, including RepeatMasker (Smit et al., 1996) and
RepeatModeler (Smit and Hubley, 2010) predictions. Sequences
from genomic regions were extracted with bedtools v2.17.0
(Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Multiple sequence alignments were built
with Mafft v6.8.57 (Katoh and Standley, 2013), through Jalview
v14 (Waterhouse et al., 2009). The maximum—likelihood phylogen—
etic tree was built with Phyml v3 (Gouy et al., 2010; Guindon et al.,
2010) using the best—fit evolutionary model HIVb (Nickle et al.,
2007) with gamma—rate heterogeneity and empirical amino acid fre—
quencies (HIVb+G+F), as determined with ProtTest v2.4 (Abascal
et al., 2005). Independent multiple sequence alignments were built
for the respective LAP2alpha domains of LAP20¢ and ZNF451—L2a.

of a LAP2alpha domain within ZNF451-L2a is supported by an Hmmscan
search against Pfam (e value of 1.5e-08). The LAP2alpha domain of both
TMPO and ZNF451 is coded by a large 3-prime exon. The exon includes a pol-
yadenylation signal that prevents the simultaneous incorporation of other
exons. In the case of ZNF451, alternatively skipped 3—prime exons code for
multiple Zinc fingers. In the case of TMPO, they code for the C-terminal half of
the protein, which includes a nuclear membrane attachment trans-membrane
helix. The exon coding the LAP2alpha domain translates into amino acid re-
gions of 497 and 506 residues (9114 and 2812 bp) in ZNF451 and TMPO,
respectively

calculated for each of these alignments using the SLAC method
(Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005) available in the DataMonkey
web server (Delport et al., 2010).

3 Results

3.1 Two genes and an alternatively spliced
mammalian—specific protein domain

Very few human protein—coding genes generate alternative isoforms
in which one Pfam functional domain (Finn et al., 2014) is substi—
tuted for another. ZNF451 is one of just nine of these genes. One of
the two ZNF451 splice isoforms has a single large 3’—exon with a
polyadenylation signal that codes for a C—terminal ‘LAP2alpha’ do—
main. The incorporation of the polyadenylation signal prevents the
incorporation of downstream exons coding for multiple zinc fingers
(Fig. 1). The LAP2alpha domain is found in just one other human
gene, TMPO. TMPO has a similar pattern of alternative splicing to
ZNF451, here the LAP2alpha C—terminal domain replaces a protein
region that contains a nuclear attachment trans—membrane (TM) re—
gion (Fig. 1). The TMPO LAP2alpha isoform is known as LAPZCX,
whereas the ZNF451 isoform is referred to as ZNF451—L2a in this
work.

TMPO (lamina—associated polypeptide 2 gene) codes for several
protein isoforms, the most studied of which are LAP2/)’ and LAP2u,
with marked differences in their cellular roles (Berger et al., 1996;
Dechat et al., 2000). The LAP2/)’ isoform is conserved as far back as
vertebrates and can attach to the nuclear envelope through its C—ter—
minal TM region and bind lamin B to the nuclear lamina (Foisner
and Gerace, 1993). ZNF451 also evolved along with vertebrates.
The main isoform of ZNF451 is a nuclear protein that, upon sumoy—
lation, localizes to promyelocytic leukemia bodies and interacts with
the androgen receptor (Feng et al., 2014; Karvonen et al., 2008).

Interestingly, although the genes TMPO and ZNF451 are pre—
sent in all vertebrate lineages, the isoforms containing the

domain originated

LAP2alpha domain are exclusive to mammals (TMPO) or euther—
ians (ZNF451). This observation is intriguing and prompted us to
determine the origin of the LAP2alpha domain and why it is con—
served in mammals.

3.2 The LAP2alpha domain originated from the GAG
ORF of a DIRS1—like retrotransposon

To characterize the origin of the LAP2alpha domain, we searched
vertebrate genomes using TBLASTN with the amino acid sequences
of the LAP2alpha domains of ZNF451—L2a and LAPZCX. In placental
mammals, we found homology in just TMPO and ZNF451. There
was no significant homology within the ZNF451 locus in opossum
or platypus, and no significant similarity was found within the
TMPO and ZNF451 loci in any non—mammalian vertebrate.

In contrast, we found numerous significant similarity hits
(TBLASTN e value < 1e—05) within the genomes of anole lizard (6),
Chinese soft—shell turtle (9) and coelacanth (11; Fig 2A). With fur—
ther sequence searches, we found that these genomes in fact con—
tained hundreds or thousands of copies (TBLASTN hits), revealing
the repetitive nature of these sequences and suggesting a TE origin.

These repetitive sequences are only annotated in Chinese soft—
shell turtle [Pelodiscus sinensis (Cunningham et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2013)]. Within the turtle, most of the TBLASTN similarity
hits overlapped or were very close to repeats annotated as DIRS1—
like, suggesting that the LAP2alpha domain may have originated
from a DIRS1—like element.

The family of DIRS1 elements has been found in almost all eu—
karyotes, and species—specific expansions have been reported in
anole lizard, Xenopus and zebrafish (Goodwin and Poulter, 2001;
Piednoel et al., 201 1). DIRS1—like elements are related to LTR—retro—
transposons and retroviruses, but they have distinctive features
(Cappello et al., 1985)—the presence of inverted terminal repeats
(ITRs instead of LTRs) and a specific mechanism for genome inte—
gration based on the action of a tyrosine recombinase related to bac—
teriophage integrases (Goodwin and Poulter, 2001).

To assess the hypothesis of a DIRS1—like origin for the mamma—
lian LAP2alpha domain, we looked for evidence in addition to the
repeat annotations from the Chinese soft—shell turtle. We took 792

genomic regions from the Western painted turtle [Chrysemys picta
bellii plus (Shaffer et al., 2013)] with homology to the LAP2alpha
domain plus 5000 downstream and upstream bps. These regions
were scanned with RPS—TBLASTN against the CDD database
(Marchler—Bauer et al., 2005). We found sequences coding for RTs,
RNases and phage integrases downstream to the regions homolo—
gous to LAP2alpha domains, in most cases of the subtype
RT_DIRS1 and RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1 (642 and 594 cases, respect—
ively), which are characteristic of DIRS1—like elements. We also
identified domains typical of phage—integrases, which are related to
the tyrosine recombinase activity of DIRS1—like elements (Goodwin
and Poulter, 2001). We manually analyzed some sequences and con—
firmed the presence of ITRs instead of LTRs, characteristic of
DIRS1—like elements (Fig. 2C). Hence, we confirmed that the
LAP2alpha domain is related to DIRS1—like elements.

DIRS1—like retrotransposons are composed of two ITRs and four
ORFs (Fig. 2C). The first ORF is usually referred to as GAG based
on the order of ORFs found in related LTR—retrotransposons and
retroviruses, where the GAG ORF codes for proteins of the nucleo—
capsid. However, no clear homology between ORF1 of DIRS1—like
elements and known retroviral GAG proteins has been found
(Goodwin and Poulter, 2001). The second ORF codes for an RT,
whereas the third and fourth ORFs code for an RNase and a tyro—
sine—recombinase (Goodwin and Poulter, 2001). We analyzed the
relative position of regions similar to RNases, RTs and phage—
recombinases with respect to the region found to be homologous to
the LAP2alpha domain in the Western painted turtle. Our results in—
dicate that the LAP2alpha domain is homologous to the GAG gene,
the first ORF of DIRS—1—like elements.

3.3. Functional implications of the LAP2alpha domain
domestication
There is peptide evidence for the expression of both TMPO and
ZNF451 LAP2alpha isoforms in mass spectrometry experiments
(F. Abascal et al., submitted). Moreover, LAP2or is the alternative
splice isoform that has most peptide support.

The TMPO LAP2alpha isoform has important cellular roles in
mammals. LAP20¢ binds lamin A in the nucleoplasm (Dechat et al.,

112 /310'S[Buln0prOJXO'SOIJ’BLUJOJIIIOICI”Zduq r1101} papeolumoq

F.Abascal et al.

 

2000; Naetar et al., 2008) and, together with lamin A/C, binds
unphosphorylated Rb, tethering it to the nucleus (Markiewicz et al.,
2002). This allows Rb to control cell—cycle progression (Giacinti and
Giordano, 2006). Interestingly, LAP2u is found within the retroviral
pre—integration complex and is necessary for the integration of the
Moloney murine leukemia virus (Suzuki et al., 2004), which may re—
ﬂect the ancestral role of the LAP2alpha domain. A mutation in the
LAP2alpha domain can cause dilated cardiomyopathy (Taylor et al.,
2005

The function of the ZNF451—L2a isoform has not been charac—
terized. Because the sumoylation motif falls within the N—terminus
that is shared between ZNF451 isoforms, ZNF451—L2a may be also
a target of sumoylation. The functional relevance of ZNF451—L2a is
supported by the observation that its LAP2alpha domain is evolving
under strong purifying selection, even stronger than in LAP2u (over—
all dN/dS of 0.16 for ZNF451—L2a and 0.38 for LAP2u, see
Section 2; Fig. 2B).

4 Conclusions

The evidence presented here strongly supports the possibility that the
LAP2alpha domain present in TMPO and ZNF451 has a retrotrans—
poson origin that can be traced back to a DIRS1—like element and the
ORF1 (GAG) gene in particular. We have found both direct and indir—
ect supporting evidence for this. Indirect evidence includes (i)
LAP2alpha domains are coded by single large exons, a hallmark of
retroposition; (ii) although the genes TMPO and ZNF451 are present
in other vertebrates, the LAP2alpha domain coding exon is specific to
mammals and (iii) in both genes, the mammalian—specific exon is sub—
ject to alternative splicing. Direct evidence relies on the very signifi—
cant sequence similarity between the LAP2alpha domain of both
LAP20¢ and ZNF451—L2a and ORF1 from DIRS1—like retro—TEs.

Many cases of domestication of TEs that have been co—opted for
new functions in the cell have been reported (Volff, 2006). In the
case presented here, the integration of the DIRS1—like element
within pre—existing genes has given rise to chimeric proteins in which
the LAP2alpha domain has replaced other protein domains. These
new proteins have been maintained throughout the evolution of
mammals and are evolving under strong purifying selection, sup—
porting their functional relevance. Probably, the most remarkable
feature of this case is that alternative splicing allowed both the new
and the original isoforms to coexist. Based on the observation that
the same pattern of alternative splicing is found within the ZNF451
and TMPO genes, we infer that the colonizing sequence probably
carried an alternative splice acceptor site plus a polyadenylation sig—
nal. This could be seen as a neutral colonization that avoided dis—
rupting the original isoforms and making possible the production of
new alternative isoforms. This characteristic may have contributed
to LAP2alpha’s successful double colonization of two independent
genes.

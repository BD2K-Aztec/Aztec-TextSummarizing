ABSTRACT

Summary: Cytoscape is an open source software tool for biological
network visualization and analysis, which can be extended with inde-
pendently developed apps. We launched the Cytoscape App Store to
highlight the important features that apps add to Cytoscape, enable
researchers to find and install apps they need and help developers
promote their apps.

Availability: The App Store is available at http://apps.cytoscape.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cytoscape is an open source software tool for network Visualiza-
tion and analysis, primarily for biological data (Cline et al., 2007;
Shannon et al., 2003). When users ﬁrst install Cytoscape, it has a
small well-defined set of functionality for working with networks.
In addition, Cytoscape has an open architecture so that others
can extend its functionality with apps. Cytoscape apps are add-
itional software packages independently developed, licensed and
installed. The wide-ranging functionality and specialization of
Cytoscape principally reside in its apps. Over 150 free apps
have been contributed to our Web site by developers from
over a dozen countries.

Originally, the Cytoscape team maintained a catalog of sub-
mitted apps (called ‘plugins’ at the time) that were accessible
from a web page or from within Cytoscape. The catalog had
several limitations. Search was limited to exact matches to app
names; users could not search by app description, category or
author; and apps were categorized by single terms chosen by the
Cytoscape team, not app developers. Each app entry in the cata-
log listed all versions of an app and did not emphasize the latest
version. This catalog did not make it easy for users to discover
apps in which they might be interested, e. g. based on their func-
tionality. Moreover, when users did find an interesting app
through the web page catalog, they had to search for the app
again in Cytoscape to install it.

To help address the needs of users, we launched the Cytoscape
App Store (Fig. 1A) to coincide with the release of Cytoscape
3.0, a major re-architecturing of Cytoscape for improved stabil-
ity, performance and versatility. The overarching goals of the
Cytoscape App Store are to highlight the important features
apps add to Cytoscape, to enable researchers to ﬁnd apps they

need and for developers to promote their apps. Here, we describe
the features of the App Store for both users and app developers.

2 METHODS

The App Store offers multiple ways for users to discover apps (Fig. 1A).
First, we provide a Featured Apps section that invites new users of
Cytoscape to simply click on a featured app, read about it and, with a
single click, install it. Thus, we promote a learning-by-action approach to
understanding the role and scope of apps by maintaining a low barrier to
entry. Second, there is a list of categories for users with a general idea of
the kind of app in which they are interested. Users ﬁnd all apps of a given
type by choking on a category. An app can belong to several categories,
each chosen by their authors. Third, users can search for an app based on
its name, description, categories, authors and authors’ institutions. With
these features, we hope to encourage users to browse the App Store,
discover and learn about apps, and install them to expand the capabilities
of Cytoscape.

App pages have several aspects to help users learn about a particular
app’s capabilities and usage (Fig. 1B). App authors can provide screen-
shots and in-depth descriptions on their app page. They can also provide
links to their own Web site and tutorials. Though not required, we
encourage authors to release their app under standard open source prac-
tices and to provide a link to a code repository. Users can also learn
about the popularity of an app by its rating and number of downloads.
Any visitor to an app page can rate it from zero to ﬁve stars, with ﬁve
stars being the best. Each app has a download statistics page with a
timeline plot of downloads per version and a world map showing
where downloads occurred. These app statistics are often valuable to
authors, as well as potential users, to track usage and justify further
development and support of their work.

Apps can be installed right from the App Store with a single click
without having to leave the browser when Cytoscape 3.0 or above is
running. If an already installed app is out-of-date, it can be upgraded
from the Web site using the same feature. The most recent version of an
app is prominently displayed; older versions of an app can be manually
downloaded in the Release History panel. From within Cytoscape,
apps can also be searched for, installed, upgraded and uninstalled using
the App Manager tool. The underlying goal of these features is to
make app installation as easy as possible. We hope to entice users to
install and experiment with apps by removing cumbersome and confusing
steps.

Aside from users, app authors also beneﬁt from the App Store.
Authors can directly edit their app pages with their changes reﬂected in
real-time preview. They can provide a custom icon, screenshots and a
unique description to distinguish their app. Authors can submit new apps
to the App Store with immediate technical feedback for ensuring that
submissions follow Cytoscape’s metadata conventions. Authors can also
post a contact email address and a link to their app’s source code to
encourage user engagement.

3 CONCLUSON

The App Store was designed with the latest Cytoscape 3.0 archi-
tecture in mind. For each Cytoscape 3.0 app, the App Store
supports unique features like one-click install and comprehensive
download statistics. 2.x Cytoscape apps are also available on the
App Store despite being incompatible with Cytoscape 3.0. We
plan to continue supporting these apps throughout the transition
to Cytoscape 3.0, though we anticipate rapid growth in new and
ported apps for 3.0 as it gains adoption in the community.

The App Store is already playing a broader role in the
Cytoscape community than just a place for browsing and sub-
mitting apps. For instance, we held a competition for the best
Cytoscape 3.0 apps in December 2012 (http://nrnb.0rg/c0mpeti
tions.html). The ﬁrst prize was shared by ClueGO, which Visual-
izes the relationship between gene ontology terms (Bindea et al.,
2009; http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cluego), and DynNetwork,
which Visualizes networks with time-based movement (http://
apps.cyt0scape.org/apps/dynnetwork). We plan to host more
competitions in the future to encourage Cytoscape 3.0 app
development.

Apps and the app developer community play a critical role in
success of Cytoscape, ensuring its continued relevance and reach

as the ﬁeld of network biology evolves. The new Cytoscape App
Store aims to increase the Visibility and accessibility of apps,
providing support to both Cytoscape users and app developers.
We anticipate that trafﬁc will continue to increase as appsiand
the App Storeibecome more prominent in the Cytoscape
community.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A gene regulatory network in which the modes (activation/
inhibition) of the transcriptional regulations are known and in which
gene expression assumes boolean values can be treated as a
system of linear equations over a binary field, i.e. as a constraint sat-
isfaction problem for an information code.

Results: For currently available gene networks, we show in this article
that the distortion associated with the corresponding information code
is much lower than expected from null models, and that it is close to
(when not lower than) the Shannon bound determined by the rate-
distortion theorem. This corresponds to saying that the distribution
of regulatory modes is highly atypical in the networks, and that this
atypicality greatly helps in avoiding contradictory transcriptional
actions.

Choosing a boolean formalism to represent the gene networks, we
also show how to formulate criteria for the selection of gates that
maximize the compatibility with the empirical information available
on the transcriptional regulatory modes. Proceeding in this way, we
obtain in particular that non-canalizing gates are upper-bounded by
the distortion, and hence that the boolean gene networks are more
canalizing than expected from null models.

1 INTRODUCTION

A gene regulatory network consists of a set of transcription fac-
tors (TF) regulating the expression of the genes of a given
genome. As our knowledge of these regulatory mechanisms
grows steadily, the problem of understanding the principles
behind their organization and their functioning is becoming a
crucial question of Systems Biology, see Bonneau, 2008;
Cosentino Lagomarsino et al., 2007; Mangan and Alon, 2003;
Materna and Davidson, 2007; Shmulevich et al., 2002. While the
current literature is focused mainly on the topological aspects of
a gene regulatory network, the perspective that we take in this
article is to study whether the transcriptional regulatory modes
(i.e. the activation/inhibition role of a TF on its target genes) of
the gene networks currently available are distributed randomly
on the given network or are organized according to some

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

criterion, and how this organization can affect the dynamics of
the gene network.

To formalize this question and to try to understand the rules
of this design, we use tools from information theory (Cover and
Thomas, 2006; Mezard and Montanari, 2009) and in particular
we treat a gene network as a ‘code’ for which the signs of the
regulatory actions constitute a particular ‘source word’, which
can be compared with the typical words generated by a corres-
ponding probabilistic model (further details on the terminology
in section 2). As a comparison criterion, we use the ‘level of
coherence’ of the regulatory actions along the network. Two
regulatory orders emanating from a TF and acting on the
same target gene (possibly through intermediate genes) are con-
sidered coherent when they induce the same behavior on the
target gene (i.e. they both induce activation or repression); they
are considered incoherent when they induce conﬂicting behav-
iors. As can be easily deduced from simple examples like Feed-
Forward Loops (FFL) (Mangan and Alon, 2003), in a gene
regulatory network, incoherence is associated with negative (un-
directed) cycles on the signed graph having the genes as nodes,
the regulations as edges and the modes of the regulations as signs
of the edges, see Iacono et al., 2010. An undirected cycle is nega-
tive when it contains an odd number of inhibitions. Provided we
associate binary values to the expression of the genes, the main
feature of a negative undirected cycle is that no choice of expres-
sion can satisfy all constraints imposed by the regulations. This
satisﬁability can be tested by formulating the ‘compatibility’ as a
system of linear algebraic equations over a binary field. In com-
binatorial optimization, such problems are well known to be
equivalent to constraint satisfaction problems of exclusive OR
(XOR) type, see Mezard and Montanari, 2009.

If the gene regulatory network is a code, and the signs of the
regulations specify a codeword, then the problem can be studied
as a (lossy) source compression problem, see Ciliberti and
Mezard, 2005; Wainwright et al., 2010. In this framework, in
particular, the level of coherence of the transcriptional regula-
tions can be rigorously computed as the distortion introduced by
the source compression problem. Computing this distortion is a
hard problem. In the constraint satisfaction literature, it is some-
times referred to as Maximum XOR Satisﬁability (MAX-
XORSAT) problem, and consists in computing the binary gene
expression assignment that maximizes the number of satisﬁed
(SAT) linear equations at steady state, see Correale et al.,
2006b; Cosentino Lagomarsino et al., 2005. For the gene net-
works currently available, the distortion can be quantiﬁed with
sufﬁcient precision and can be compared with two important
quantities: (i) the average distortion of a typical word associated

to the same ‘code’ (i.e. a gene network with the same topology
but signs reshuffled); (ii) the best average distortion achievable
by any gene network with the same ratio of genes/regulations.
The latter value corresponds to the Shannon bound provided by
the rate-distortion theorem (Cover and Thomas, 2006).

We show in the article that the distortion of the currently
available gene networks is much lower than the one of a typical
sequence of the same code, and that it is comparable with (when
not better than) the Shannon bound. This atypicality implies that
in our gene networks the signs of the transcriptional regulations
are highly organized and far from random. In particular, the
origin of the low distortion can be traced in the scarcity of
dual-mode TF, i.e. of TF acting both as activators and as repres-
sors. Our calculation suggests a practical reason for such an or-
ganization: single-mode TF lower the distortion and hence help
in avoiding conﬂictual transcriptional orders in which different
TF induce contradictory actions on a downstream gene.

In a gene network represented as a signed graph, the regula-
tory actions represent two-body interaction terms (i.e. the value
of a gene acting as a TF, multiplied by that of its target gene,
with the sign of the corresponding edge) or, in system-theoretic
language, Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) regulations. When
multiple genes act simultaneously as TF on a target gene, the
overall regulation can be described as a superposition of these
SISO terms. An alternative assumption, common in the gene
network literature (Balleza et al., 2008; Buchler et al., 2003;
Correale et al., 2006b; Kauffman, 1993; Kauffman et al., 2004;
Shmulevich et al., 2005; Silva-Rocha and de Lorenzo, 2008; van
Hijum et al., 2009), is that the transcription of a gene having
multiple regulators is decided by some logical combination of the
inputs. This corresponds to replacing superpositions of two-body
terms with a single multibody term (MISO: Multi-Input Single-
Output action). One of the major drawbacks of the boolean
networks obtained in this way is the arbitrarity in the choice of
the gates, due to the lack of systematic methods for gates disam-
biguation based on experimental evidence (see e.g. Bonneau,
2008; Chowdhury et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2007; Lau et al.,
2007; Shmulevich et al., 2002; Silva-Rocha and de Lorenzo,
2008; Zou, 2010 for a few attempts in this direction, mostly
based on inference from microarrays).

The approach that we take in this article is to try to identify
classes of boolean gates such that the steady-state MISO predic-
tions for the regulation overlap as much as possible with the
corresponding SISO predictions. In terms of perturbative expan-
sions, this corresponds to asking that the two-body projections
of the complex multibody terms be ‘coherent’ with the corres-
ponding two-body terms, whenever the latter are not ambiguous.
The rationale behind this choice is that the only type of informa-
tion currently available in large-scale gene networks is precisely
compendia of SISO regulatory signs. We will show in the article
that under this assumption, a natural choice is to associate cana-
lizing gates (i.e. AND-OR type of gates, see Kauffman, 1993) to
positive undirected cycles and (possibly) non-canalizing gates to
negative undirected cycles. The property of low distortion of the
gene networks then reflects in a low amount of non-canalizing
gates in the boolean formulations of the gene networks with
respect to null models.

Looking at the corresponding dynamics, we observe that, in
spite of the higher canalization, our gene networks seem to be

more sensitive to perturbations than the corresponding null
models. This appears to be due to the near-acyclic and massively
parallel feed-forward architecture of the networks, in which non-
canalizing gates have the effect of breaking the steady-state
global symmetry of the basic inputioutput motifs.

2 METHODS

Gene regulatory networks and SISO constraint satisfaction prob-
lems. Consider a gene regulatory network composed of n nodes

x = [x1...x,,]T representing the genes and m directed edges

y = [y1  ym]T representing regulatory actions of activation/
inhibition of a gene on another gene. Assume both x and y are
represented in boolean terms, x,- e X = {0, 1} 2 {‘low’, ‘high’},
and y,- e 3} = {0, 1}, where we use the convention that 0 stands
for activation (i.e. ‘+’) and 1 for inhibition (i.e. ‘—’), see example
in Figure 1A. Then both 3} and X can be identiﬁed with 22, the
Galois ﬁeld with two elements endowed with the operation 69
(addition mod2).

In this section, we are interested in formulating a description
of the ﬁxed points of the signed graph (of nodes x and edges y)
representing the gene regulatory network. We shall for now
assume that each regulatory action is SISO and that multiple
regulations acting on the same gene happen simultaneously, in-
dependently and in parallel. Consider for example a single regu-
latory action yl between the two genes x1 and x2 (i.e. m = 1,
n=2). For any value yl e y, it is always possible to ﬁnd (at
least) a combination of x1, x2 6 X, which is ‘compatible’ with
the expected action described by the sign yl. If, for example,
y1 = 0 (i.e. activation), then the regulation is SAT when x1, x2

distance d(y, y)/m. In our gene networks the distortion of a network is a
measure of potential ‘conﬂicts’ (or contradictory orders) in the gene regu-
latory program of an organism

assume the same value, opposite values when y1 = 1, see
Supplementary Figure S1. Using the formalism of constraint sat-
isfaction problems (Mezard et al., 2003; Mezard and Montanari,
2009), we can rewrite this ‘compatibility’ condition as a linear
equation over a binary ﬁeld: x1 69x2 = y1. This exclusive-OR
satisﬁability 0(ORSAT) problem can also be written as
x1 69 x2 69 y1 = 0-

Let us make use of an m x n matrix A to describe the topology
of the gene network. Each row of A identiﬁes an edge, and has
two non-zero entries (equal to l) in correspondence of the two
genes involved in the regulatory action (the order is irrelevant for
our purposes), see Figure 1A for an example. Finding gene ex-
pression assignments x e X" compatible with all the regulatory
signs of a given y e 37” means solving a linear system over the 22
ﬁeld:

Ax®y=0. (1)

The XORSAT problem (1) may or may not have a solution
depending on y. When (1) has no solution (it is said UNSAT
in this case), then one can look for the x e X” that solves most of
the m constraints of (1). This problem is called MAX-XORSAT,
see Mezard and Montanari, 2009. Denoting d(y, Ax) the
Hamming distance between y and Ax, then solving the MAX-
XORSAT for a given y means finding 32 that minimizes d(y, Ax):

SE = argminxexnd(y, Ax) = argminxeXn

The relative Hamming distance

DA,y = — min d(y, Ax) (3)

is called the distortion of the ‘word’ y associated to the ‘code’ (1)-
(2). We shall call average distortion of the gene regulatory net-
work associated to (1)-(2) the expectation of (3) over the entire
alphabet 31’”:

0.1 = iygmprymry, A?) (4)

where, for each y, 32 solves (2). Denoting’y = AS? the estimate of
y obtained through (2) (see Fig. 1B), then DA 2 0 if and only if
V = y Vy e 31’”.

Example: FFL. Let us consider as an example the FFL of
Figure 2. In a FFL, n = m = 3, and hence both alphabets X"
and 31’” consist of eight words, and we may ask if for each choice
of y e 313 there is always an x e X3 such that (1) is SAT. In this
case, the connectivity matrix A is the following

1 1 0
A = 1 0 1 (5)
0 1 1
and it is straightforward to verify that only in four of the eight
choices of y (1) is SAT. These cases (Fig. 2A) are known in the
literature as coherent FFL, whereas the 4 UNSAT cases (Fig. 2B)
are called incoherent in Mangan and Alon, 2003. In a coherent
FFL d(y, A3?) = 0, whereas in an incoherent FFL d(y, A3?) = l,
i.e. DA” 2 1/3. See Supplementary Information and

itself canalizing (E). No bicanalizing steady state is possible for incoherent

Computing distortion for a gene regulatory network. In infor-
mation theory, the process of obtaining’yfrom y through (1)-(2)
in the regime n<m is called a lossy source compression problem,
see Figure 1 and the Supplementary Information. In particular,
solving the combinatorial optimization problem (2) corresponds
to encoding the length-m binary sequence y into the length-n
binary sequence 32 through the ‘channel’ given by the connectivity
matrix A. Decoding then corresponds to constructing an estimate

Boolean networks and steady-state consistency. A Boolean net-
work or, more generally, a discrete dynamical system on 22 can
be written as

x(t + l) = ¢(x(t)), x(t + l), x(t) e X” (6)

where q) = ($1,  ,¢,,) : X” —> X” is the boolean state update
map. If k,- is the in-degree of a fan-in node x,-, then k,- > 1, and the

value x,-(t + 1) is decided univocally from the values of its pre-
cursory inputs, denoted xi, , . . . , xiki, according to a logical func-
tion: x,-(t +  = ([51061] (I), . . . , xiki(t)).

As in the previous section, we aim at studying ﬁxed points of
the dynamics, where a ﬁxed point for the system (6) is x e X”
such that x = ¢(x). Setting the problem as in (1) corresponds to
saying that all transcriptional actions happen independently and
in parallel at each fan-in node. The concept is natural in con-
tinuous-time models, where superposition of the effects can take
place, but it is ambiguous for discrete dynamics in 22. Placing a
function ()5,- on each fan-in node resolves all ambiguities and
guarantees existence and uniqueness of the solution of (6).

In particular, we aim at formulating a constraint satisfaction
problem containing all our information about transcriptional
regulation and at exploring what functions ()5 are compatible
with it. In the boolean networks literature, this approach is
referred to as consistency problem, see Shmulevich et al., 2002.

A k-input boolean logic gives rise to 22k possible boolean
gates. Little is known empirically on the actual update rules at
fan-in nodes in real genome-wide transcriptional networks,
except for some case-by-case analysis (Albert and Othmer,
2003; Harris et al., 2002; Materna and Davidson, 2007) and
some in-depth studies of speciﬁc transcriptional units (Buchler
et al., 2003; Setty et al., 2003). Especially when k,->2, it is not
even an obvious assumption that the k,- inputs necessarily have to
form a single coordinated transcriptional logic unit, rather than
multiple concomitant, independent subunits, perhaps active in
different environmental conditions.

In random boolean networks (Kauffman, 1993), k,- and ¢,~(-) of
each node are chosen randomly. In our gene networks, such
random choice would disregard the information we have avail-
able about the topology and about the regulatory action (acti-
vation/inhibition) from each precursor xj to x,-. This information
can be used to prune a large part of the possible gates. If adopt-
ing the topology of the true networks means fixing the k,- pre-
cursors of each node (Correale et al., 2006a; Kauffman et al.,
2003), imposing in the boolean logic the compatibility with the
direct SISO regulations requires assuming that all the functions
¢,~(-) are unate in each of the arguments (Sontag et al., 2008).
This corresponds to saying that multiple appearances of the same
xj in one of the ¢,~(-) must be characterized by the same sign. In
turn, ()5 unate implies that it is possible to ﬁx the sign of each
input of the gate equal to the value of the direct SISO transcrip-
tional regulation. Once this compatibility condition is taken into
account, further negations on the gates should be avoided,
thereby reducing drastically the number of possible choices.

Formally, we have to solve the following steady-state consist-
ency problem, see Correale et al., 2006b; Cosentino Lagomarsino
et al., 2005

Find ¢,-: xki —> x, i: 1,  s.t.

x,-®¢,-(*,...,*,xj,*,...,*)=yg (7)
Vj,eS.t.3Az,[=Ag,j=1.

Because ()5,- is unate, the edge sign ya can be explicitly attributed
to xj by replacing (7) with

x,®¢,~(*,...,*,yg®xj,*,...,*)=0 (8)
SI. HAM-2AM: 

The argument above allows to restrict the search to (15,-, which do
not contain any negation neither on the output nor in the inputs
(except for the ye).

Let us consider for example the 16 gates of a two-input (15,-, see
Table S3. These gates can be classiﬁed into four groups (Correale
et al., 2006b):

1. Constant functions (2 gates);
2. Projections (4 gates);

3. XOR class (2 gates);

4. AND-OR class (8 gates).

Excluding the trivial functions in class 1 and 2, and excluding the
gates containing negations [in (8) the ye are not considered part
of the function (1),] leaves us with only three gates: AND, OR and
XOR. Qualitatively, the AND-OR gates differ from the XOR
gate in the sense that the former are canalizing in one of the
inputs, while XOR is not. A gate is said canalizing if at least
one of its inputs has a value that alone decides the output of the
gate, regardless of the values of the other variables. The canaliz-
ing value is 0 for AND and 1 for OR. For XOR instead no input
is canalizing. For random boolean networks, it is well known
that canalizing functions represent mechanisms associated
with ordered dynamical behavior (as opposed to chaotic
behavior), see Kauffman, 1993; Kauffman et al., 2004. In the
compendium of transcriptional mechanisms analyzed in Harris
et al., 2002, for example, canalizing functions are neatly
overrepresented.

In the following we show that further constraints on the
gates, and in particular a criterion to discern canalizing from
(potentially) non-canalizing gates, can be deduced by imposing
that on certain positive undirected cycles, the ‘multibody’
steady-state behavior must be compatible with the direct
SISO regulations. Let us consider Feed-Forward Circuits
(FFC), i.e. FFL-like subgraphs with a single root (i.e. node
with zero in-degree) and a single sink (i.e. node with zero out-
degree) but branches of any length. For these FFC, positivity
of the undirected cycle amounts to having the same signature
along the two-directed paths connecting the single root to the
single sink. In terms of constraint satisfaction conditions (1)-
(2), the corresponding subproblems must be SAT, and this
means that a steady state is uniquely determined along the
cycle by the value taken by the root. This means also that
at steady state the root-sink boolean relationship relies on at
least two independent transcriptional routes. For positive
FFC, in particular, the two relationships are coherent in the
sense that they agree on the root-sink steady-state value. Root-
sink coherent redundancies like this can be taken as criteria
for discerning the type of gate to be placed at multiinput
nodes involved in FFC motifs.

Example: consistency for boolean FFL. An isolated FFL with
its single root, single sink and two-input logic gate is an example
of undirected cycle splittable into two-directed paths. If we con-
sider a coherent FFL as in Figure 2C, then at a ﬁxed point the
direct SISO constraints are x2 2 in and x3 = x1 (after the double
negation). Replacing the direct SISO actions on x3 with a two-
input gate ([53 (x1, x2) then (8) becomes:

x3 69 ¢3(x1, 922) = x3 69 ¢3(x1, x1) = 0-

It is straightforward to verify that (153 2 {AND, OR} are both
compatible with the root-sink actions of each directed path,
while XOR is not, see Figure 2E.

If instead we consider the incoherent FFL in Figure 2D, the
SISO steady-state compatibility conditions reduce to x2 2 X1 be-
cause the value of x3 is ambiguous and (8) is

x3 69 $3061, x2) = x3 69 $3061, 561) = 0-

Depending on the choice of (153 (see Fig. 2F), at steady state we
have Vxl

x_ 0 if¢3=AND
3— 1 if¢3=OR,XOR.

As expected, for incoherent FFL, no gate can be compatible with
the root-sink action on both branches simultaneously. Each of
the basic gates opts for one of the choices. It is consequently
impossible to discriminate between AND, OR or XOR with
the SISO information available. Notice how in correspondence
of each choice of (153 the steady-state value of x3 is blocked for all
possible values of x1. No steady-state block appears instead in
the coherent FFL with canalizing gates, where in addition at
steady state AND and OR are indistinguishable and the
output is completely determined by x1. This can be rephrased
in terms of global symmetry of the corresponding SAT subpro-
blem. Steady-state blocks, like in the incoherent FFL, break the
global symmetry on the corresponding motif: ﬂipping the value
of the root does not result in a steady-state ﬂip at the sink. We
shall denote FFL motifs (and more generally FFC motifs) re-
specting the global inputioutput steady-state symmetry
bicanalizing.

3 RESULTS/DISCUSSION

The distortion of the gene networks of Table I. Consider the three
gene regulatory networks of Table 1. In a source compression
scheme, the difﬁcult task is the encoding part [i.e. solving the
MAX-XORSAT problem (2)]. For two-body constraints like (2),
it is well known to be equivalent to solving a maximum cut
problem or to computing the ground state of an Ising spin
glass with bimodal bonds, see Mezard and Montanari, 2009.

For the three gene-regulatory networks of Table 1, efﬁcient
heuristics are discussed in Iacono et al., 2010; Iacono and
Altaﬁni, 2010, see also Supplementary Information for a recap.
In the following, we denote D2? the distortion in correspond-
ence of the true (‘empirical’) edge sign assignments y of a given
network. The values reported in Table 1 are computed from the
‘distance to monotonicity’ of Iacono and Altaﬁni, 2010, using
(3). The upper and lower bounds computed for D2? are fairly
tight, see Table 1.

Needless to say, it is impossible to evaluate exactly quantities
such as (4), which are computed exhaustively over 31’”. To esti-
mate DA, we can repeat the same optimization as in (2) on a
sufﬁciently large number of null models, obtained drawing
length-m independent identically distributed edge sign words
from a Bernoulli distribution B(q), where q = m’ /m is the frac-
tion of negative edge signs of the original y; see Table 1 and the
Supplementary Information for more details. As can be seen on

Table 1, D2? <DA for all three gene networks, meaning that the

true gene networks have less distortion than the corresponding
null models (coherently with the results reported in Iacono et al.,
2010; Iacono and Altaﬁni, 2010). Notice that only nodes
involved in undirected cycles contribute to the distortion. In par-
ticular, then, intending the networks as undirected graphs and
restricting to the bicomponents (i.e. dropping the nodes/edges
not involved in undirected cycles) means changing the values
of n and m, and hence of D2? and of D A, see Supplementary
Table S2.

Both D31}; and D A are obtained in correspondence of the given
topology, described by the connectivity matrix A. If we allow
also the topology to vary, then we can use the rate-distortion
theorem of information theory (Cover and Thomas, 2006) to
determine the admissible region for the distortion D for all pos-
sible compression rates R = n/m in correspondence of a 8(q)
source of edge sign words. As explained in the Supplementary
Information, the boundary of such an admissible region repre-
sents a Shannon-type bound, and it is achieved in correspond-
ence of a ‘best’ network topology. For Bernoulli sources, the
distortion D on such bound can be computed explicitly; see
(S2) on the Supplementary Information. In Figure 3, the
Shannon bound D is compared with D2? and DA for the
three gene networks of Table 1. As can be observed, the values
of D2? are close to the corresponding D. In particular, once we
restrict to the bicomponents (insets in Fig. 3A7C), D2? <D in
two of the three networks. On the contrary, D A >> D in all three
cases. The meaning is that in spite of non-optimal topologies, the
distortions of our gene regulatory networks (which, from
D2? <DA, we know to be much lower than expected) are also
at the level expected for a ‘best’ network topology.

A statistical physics analog of an XORSAT problem is an
Ising spin glass (Mezard and Montanari, 2009); see
Supplementary Information. In this context, the distortion
D2? has the interpretation of ‘frustration’ encoded in the undir-
ected cycles, i.e. of linearly independent undirected cycles having
negative sign (meaning an odd number of inhibitions). Our
result, therefore, implies that frustration is largely absent in
these signed graphs. Notice that direct counts of the basic
frustrated/non—frustrated motifs such as the incoherent/coherent
FFL are largely inconclusive; see Supplementary Information
and Table S1. The true distortion can be computed only
genome-wide, and its calculation confirms that indeed conﬂictual
orders are largely avoided.

Low distortion and single-mode TF. It is worth mentioning that
the origin of the low-distortion of the gene networks lies in the
highly skewed distribution of the signs of the actions of the TF.
As can be seen in Figure 4, the vast majority of the TF tends to
operate in a single-mode fashion on all their target genes. Dual-
mode TF are statistically rare with respect to the null models
(cumulative binomial test, P—Value 10’2). See Supplementary
Tables S4 and S&S7 for more details. While this skewness is
expected, as the physical interaction mechanisms of an activator
and of an inhibitor are normally different, its consequences for
the regulation on a genome-wide scale have rarely been assessed,
except on small motifs like FFL. Following the arguments of
Facchetti et al., 2011, Iacono and Altaﬁni, 2010, and in particu-
lar the notion of gauge equivalence discussed therein, it can be
shown that such a pattern is responsible for the limited amount
of distortion of these networks. On the contrary, the signs on the

Fig. 3. Distortion and Shannon bounds. For the three gene networks of Table 1 [(A) E.coli; (B) S.cerevisiae; (C) B.subtilis], the distortion in corres-
pondence of the ‘true’ edge signs y (03:15) and in correspondence of the null models (D A) is compared with the Shannon bound given by the rate-
distortion theorem (yellow curve); see Supplementary Information. Upper and lower bounds on Damp and on D A are normally close; see Table 1 (one
exception is D A for E.coli). In the insets, the same quantities are shown for the bicomponents of the networks (where nodes and edges not involved in
undirected cycles are dropped; see Supplementary Table S2). In this last case, 03?; is below the Shannon bound in two of the three networks (and close

in the third one). In all cases, 02?; <DA, i.e. the distortion is atypical for a 8(q) source of words (i.e. of edge sign assignments)

Fig. 4. Single-mode action of the TF. The histograms show the number of positive and negative edges in the out-degree of the TF for the three networks
[(A) E.coli; (B) S .cerevisiae; (C) B.subtilis]. The histograms are highly skewed, meaning that the majority of TF have a single mode of action. In
particular, the TF signiﬁcantly single mode (with respect to a cumulative binomial test, P-value 10’2) are highlighted in color: blue for activators, red for
repressors. See also Supplementary Tables SSPS7 for a list of the corresponding genes. For E.coli, the few TF having both positive and negative edges are

well-known dual-mode regulators, such as crp, fnr, ihf, fis, arcA and narL. See Supplementary Table S4

incoming edges at the target genes do not show any deviation
from the null models. See Supplementary Information and
Supplementary Figure S2 for more details.

Distortion as an upper bound on non-canalizing functions of
boolean networks. In non-isolated FFL, the bicanalizing proper-
ties of boolean logic mentioned in section 2 extend to output
nodes that are fan-in of multiple coherent FFL, see
Supplementary Figure S3, while in presence of one or more in-
coherent FFL the situation is more complex, and more difﬁcult
to analyze in detail; see e. g. Supplementary Figure S4. Not only
the type of gates chosen matters in this case, but also the order in
which logical operations are carried out; see table in
Supplementary Figure S4. The case in which the node x2 of an
FFL has in-degree greater than 1 is equally complex because the
motifs have more than one root. See Supplementary Figures
S&S7 for a few examples. While the nested FFL case of
Supplementary Figure S5 is always bicanalizing, in
Supplementary Figure S6 even though all undirected cycles are
positive, the multiinput motif is bicanalizing only for some com-
binations of AND, OR. In Supplementary Figure S7, instead, no
logic gate can achieve bicanalization. Even on these simple ex-
amples, it is possible to observe how the choice of non-canalizing

gates along positive undirected cycles can lead to paradoxical
input-output steady-state behaviors. Notice for example in
Supplementary Figure S6 how XOR can induce ‘wrong’ bicana-
lizations, i.e. bicanalization with respect to the wrong input.

For these reasons, and to maximize the ‘overlap’ between
SISO transcriptional actions and MISO actions induced by the
boolean logic, it is reasonable to assume that positive undirected
cycles are preferentially endowed with canalizing gates, while in
negative undirected cycles no priority can be imposed on the type
of gates. This choice corresponds to solving the steady-state con-
sistency problem while maximizing the satisﬁability to both (1)
and (8). Following Correale et al., 2006a, the problem can be
stated rigorously as a MAX-SAT problem subject jointly to (1)
and (8); see Supplementary Information. Proceeding in this way,
we obtain that in our boolean gene networks the number of non-
canalizing gates is upper bounded by Di? (and for null models
by D A). Because D2? <DA and D2? approaches the Shannon
bound, this criterion implies that non-canalizing gates for the
true edge sign words y are remarkably underrepresented with
respect to the null models on the same topology.

Fig. 5. Steady-state perturbation of the boolean network of E.coli. Fifty
different boolean networks are constructed on the topology of the E.coli
gene network, for both the true sign assignment y and for 50 random sign
words drawn from 8(a) (null models). The networks are unary, and non-
canalizing gates (XOR) are allowed only in correspondence of negative
undirected cycles (AND, OR and XOR are chosen at random in this
case). Each curve of the plot represents an average over 500 trajectories
obtained perturbing a steady state for both the true (solid) and the null
(dashed) models. The size of the perturbation at t = 0 varies between 1
and 8% of the number of genes. In all curves, perturbations on the (more
canalized) true boolean network tend to settle at a larger distance from
the steady state than in the (less canalized) null models

of our gene networks, in which the gates are drawn at random,
but respecting the rule above that non-canalizing gates are ad-
missible only in presence of negative undirected cycles. We focus
in particular on the more complex Escherichia coli gene network
(the other two have a lower size and a much simpler topology;
see Supplementary Figure S2). It is interesting to compare the
dynamics obtained in this way with those of the null models, in
which the number of non-canalizing gates is higher. For random
boolean networks, non-canalizing is taken as a proxy for com-
plex, chaotic-like behavior; see Kauffman, 1993; Kauffman et al.,
2004. Topologically, our gene networks differ from random net-
works in many aspects, most importantly in the limited number
of feedback loops and in the highly parallel feed-forward archi-
tecture (Cosentino Lagomarsino et al., 2007); see Supplementary
Table S8. For a boolean network with these characteristics,
rather than rendering the dynamics chaotic, the presence of
XOR gates has the effect of constraining the possible steady
states admissible by the system. In this respect, the whole net-
work replicates the blocking phenomenon we have observed on
small motifs like FFL. In particular, in Figure 5, a perturbation
analysis is shown. In the true network, perturbations of a steady
state tend to persist more than in a null model, and the new
steady state tends to remain more distant from the original one
than in the null models. This behavior is consistent across all
perturbation sizes and is not explainable in terms of the sign of
the feedback loops: we recover in fact the same behavior when
we consider the maximal directed acyclic graph extracted from
the gene network, see Supplementary Figure S8.

In Figure 5, the fact that the perturbed initial conditions in
average do not increase their distance to the steady state as time
grows (apart from a transient of limited amplitude for the null
models) is an indication of a non-chaotic regime. The fact that

the distance does not decrease much in time is less predictable
because in an ordered regime one would expect perturbations to
die out consistently. Comparing Figure 5 and Supplementary
Figure S8, we can observe how the presence of a few directed
cycles can impact significantly the response to perturbations,
rendering the gene networks much less stable than one would
expect from their nearly acyclic, massively feed-forward topology
and their high level of canalization. This conﬁrms, if necessary,
that the predictions one obtains through a random boolean net-
work (even those obtained choosing a ﬂat distribution of boo-
lean rules on a given topology) are of limited signiﬁcance for
models closer to the reality of currently available gene networks.

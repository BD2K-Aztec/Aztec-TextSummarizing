ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recent genomic studies have confirmed that cancer
is of utmost phenotypical complexity, varying greatly in terms
of subtypes and evolutionary stages. When classifying cancer
tissue samples, subnetwork marker approaches have proven to
be superior over single gene marker approaches, most importantly
in cross-platform evaluation schemes. However, prior subnetwork-
based approaches do not explicitly address the great phenotypical
complexity of cancer.

Results: We explicitly address this and employ density-constrained
biclustering to compute subnetwork markers, which reflect pathways
being dysregulated in many, but not necessarily all samples under
consideration. In breast cancer we achieve substantial improvements
over all cross-platform applicable approaches when predicting TP53
mutation status in a well-established non-cross-platform setting.
In colon cancer, we raise prediction accuracy in the most difficult
instances from 87% to 93% for cancer versus non-cancer and from
83% to (astonishing) 92%, for with versus without liver metastasis, in
well-established cross-platform evaluation schemes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Throughout the decades, cancer has been not only a most daunting,
but also most intriguing disease to study. It is daunting since it
persistently keeps escaping our deeper understanding while, at the
same time, it is the reason for as many as 13% of human deaths
worldwide. As a mere object to study, however, it is also most
fascinating since it is crucially entangled with the mechanisms which
are responsible for cellular welfare. Clearly, a deeper understanding
of cancer would shed light on a wealth of aspects being essential for
eukaryotic life.

In the meantime, there has been abundant evidence that cancer
is phenotypically of utmost complexity. On one hand, most
recent studies on cancer genomes reveal the extent of DNA
damage (Beroukhim et (11., 2010; Campbell et (11., 2008; Hampton

et (11., 2009)—numbers of copy number variations and genomic
rearrangements are so large that one can hardly believe that
cancer cells are viable at all. On the other hand, it has been
well-known that cancer cells evolve (Fearon and Vogelstein,
1990). Starting out as healthy human cells they gradually undergo
phenotypical changes through accumulating genomic alterations
ﬁrst transforming into malignant and ﬁnally into metastatic and/or
therapy-resistant specimens. In conclusion, it is safe to assume that
no two cancer genomes of two different people, at least at ﬁrst
glance, even look similar and even one person’s cancer is made up
by a variety of different cell types belonging to the different stages
of cancer evolution.

Nevertheless, it is possible to classify cancer, to identify subtypes
common to many people and also to cure or at least to slow
down progression in many patients by means of identical therapy
protocols. Therefore, one of the most driving questions in most
recent research is to reveal the genetic alterations common to all
cancer cells within and also across its many subtypes.

To successfully classify cancer tissue samples one needs reliable
criteria on the biomolecular level that is disease markers. While
markers serve as indicators of cancer and/or its subtypes in the ﬁrst
place they can also point at the crucial processes and perturbations
giving rise to cancer such that it may be worth studying them beyond
their role as classiﬁcation features.

In a seminal study, Golub et (11. (1999) successfully identiﬁed 50
differentially expressed genes which can successfully distinguish
between two leukemia subtypes. Similar approaches determined
differentially expressed genes for B-cell lymphoma (Alizadeh et (11.,
2000), breast (van de Vijver et (11., 2002; Wang et (11., 2005) and
lung cancer (Beer et (11., 2002), which served as monogenic, that is
single gene markers (SGMs).

However, SGM sets determined based on differential expression
varied considerably when inferring them from different platforms
such that they were useless in cross-platform studies, hence of
no universal applicability (Ein-Dor et (11., 2005, 2006). Chuang
et (11. (2007) ﬁnally pointed out that multigenic markers were
able to address this issue. Multigenic markers consist of several
differentially expressed genes which also form a connected region
in protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks and proved to be
more stable predictors in cross-platform evaluation schemes. Similar
approaches followed (Chowdhury and Koyutiirk, 2010; Ulitsky
et (11., 2008) where only the latter focuses on cancer. While the
primary purpose of subnetwork marker computation is to provide
cross-platform-applicable indicators of disease, they can also yield
further insights on cancer because they usually reﬂect (parts of)
dysregulated pathways.

Inference of subnetwork markers comes with most demanding
computational and combinatorial challenges due to the tremendous
number of plausible subnetwork patterns to be examined. Here,
we aimed at solving a combinatorial problem which particularly
addresses that the same cancer can come in many different subtypes
and stages of progression which cannot necessarily distinguished
by visual inspection (e.g. Rosenwald et a1., 2002). Namely, we
addressed that pathways which are dysregulated in cancer can show
in many, but not all cancer patients. This reﬂects that cancer is a
most diverse disease which, nonetheless, can be classiﬁed—there
are phenomena which are common to many (but not necessarily all)
different specimens.

Summary of contributions: We present a computational strategy to
solve this combinatorial search problem and show that applying
it results in exhaustive enumeration of subnetwork biclusters that
is combinations of gene and sample clusters where participating
genes form dense, connected subgraphs in a PPI network. Hence,
our markers can be taken as (fractions of) pathways which are
dysregulated in sufﬁciently many, but not necessarily all cancer
(subtype) samples. To serve the purposes of a fair benchmarking
competition we ﬁrst perform cross-platform classiﬁcation on
colon cancer datasets as described in the state-of—the-art approach
of Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010) and outperform the prior
approaches partly by raising accuracy by a relative increase of
nearly 50%. Second, we perform cross-validation (within the same
platform) experiments on breast cancer as described in Miller
et al. (2005) and outperform all approaches which yield universal,
platform-independent markers. In both cases, we analyze the
subnetworks associated with our top-ranked markers.

2 APPROACH

Our approach differs from the previous approaches predominantly
in terms of how subnetwork markers are computed. To subsequently
classify, well-established techniques such as support vector mach-
ines (Scholkopf and Smola, 2002) were used in all related studies.
The general idea behind computation of subnetwork markers is to
search for combinations of genes which

(1) are ‘sufﬁciently’ differentially expressed in the cancer tissue
samples from the gene expression training data and

(2) form a connected pattern in the PPI network. See Figure. 1
for a generic example.

Prior work: the idea which is common to the majority of
prior approaches is to aim at inferring genes g whose gene
expression proﬁles E(g) ERK (where K is the number of samples)
share large mutual information with the phenotype proﬁle P=
(1, ..., 1,2,...,2)e {1,2}K where Pk = 1,2 indicates whether sample
k belongs to the phenotype (cancer/cancer subtype) or not where
large mutual information roughly translates to strong correlation.
Correspondingly, SGMs are selected as single genes g where
E(g) has large mutual information whereas subnetwork markers,
in previous approaches, were chosen such that the average gene
expression proﬁle of all genes participating in the marker shares
large mutual information with P. We refer the reader to the
Supplementary Materials for more details and also for a more
detailed description of the subnetwork marker approaches of Chuang
et al. (2007) and Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010) which serve as

Interaction/Association Network

Fig. 1. When determining subnetwork markers one aims at ﬁnding groups of
genes where genes have expression proﬁles which are different in cancer and
control and also form a connected pattern in an accompanying PPI network.
Here. genes 1. 2. 3 and 4 comply with these criteria.

benchmarking partners. None of the approaches from above follows
the idea that certain subnetworks might be dysregulated in some, but
not all samples. Our approach speciﬁcally addresses this point.

Our method : three things are substantially different:

(1) The PPI networks we employ are conﬁdence scored (Jensen
et a1., 2009).

(2) Our subnetworks not only need to be connected, but also need
to contain a sufﬁcient amount of edge weight (= conﬁdence
scores).

(3) In our case, all genes in a subnetwork need to be dysregulated
in a subset of patients of size at least L, but not necessarily in
all patients. In other words, the genes of the subnetwork and
the L cancer samples in which the subnetwork, as a whole, is
dysregulated form a bicluster. See Figure 2 for two examples
of subnetwork markers and Section 3 for precise deﬁnitions.

The advantage of conﬁdence-scored physical PPI networks is that
each detected physical interaction is rated by the likelihood that the
interaction does play a cellular role and is not merely an experimental
artifact. As a consequence, dense connectivity can be interpreted
as that the genes in the subnetwork establish a cellular functional
element through physically interacting with each other which comes
from accumulating high conﬁdence scores within the subnetwork
(Jensen et a1., 2009). In fact, many markers we compute are enriched
with Gene Ontology terms whereas this is not as obvious for the
previous approaches (Section 4). The third point ﬁnally reﬂects the
discussion from above: unlike in the previous approaches, we would
like to have markers apply as an entity for a suﬁcient amount but
not necessarily all cancer samples.

Further related work: colorectal cancer is a most ubiquitous type
of cancer which has been well studied (Fearon and Vogelstein,
1990; Macdonald et a1., 2004; Nibbe et a1., 2010). Similarly, breast
cancer has been received widespread attention. Apart from work
cited above, see Gasco et al. (2002) for a review on pathways
disturbed in breast cancer. See Section 4 for more related work.
There have been many network approaches to search for interesting
subnetwork patterns where participating genes are differentially

expressed which, however, were not used in clinical settings. See

(2007) for most prominent approaches and a review and Xu et al.
(2007) for a study on cancer differential co-expression networks.
Density-constrained biclustering was originally discussed in binary
edge-weight network settings (Colak, 2008; Moser et a1., 2009).
Here, we extend it to networks with edge weights and deliver the
proof that the analogous search strategy applies. Note also (Georgii
et a1., 2009) where it is shown that, in weighted-edge networks,
density is a loose antimonotone property (see deﬁnition below).
Here, we generalize this showing this for density and connectivity
in combination.

3 METHODS AND DATA

3.1 Notations, deﬁnitions and theorems

Let G=(V,E) be a network where the set of nodes V is identiﬁed with the
genes. respectively. their associated proteins and an edge e: (u, v) indicates
a potential physical PPI between the proteins associated with u,ve V. We
also have a weight function on the edges

w : E —> [0, 1]
where w(e) is the conﬁdence score associated with edge eeE. We recall
that w(e) reﬂects our degree of belief that the physical PPI associated with e

plays a functional cellular role. In order to have gene expression experiments
included in our considerations we have a diﬁerential expression label function
D: V—> {+, —,0}K

which assigns a K -dimensional vector D(v) with entries + (overexpressed in
cancer sample). — (underexpressed in cancer sample) and 0 (not differentially
expressed in cancer sample) to each of the nodes where K is the number of
cancer samples in the dataset. We denote the i-th entry of D(v) by D(v), such
that. for example. D(v),»=+ means that gene v is overexpressed in cancer
sample i. We then deﬁne:

0 The density 6(G’) of a subnetwork G’ =(V’,E’) of G is

ZeeE/w(e) _ 2-ZeeE/w(e)

6 G, := , _—
( ) (1‘31) IV’KIV’l—l)

where (Hg/l) is the number of possible edges in G’.

0 G’ is called ot-dense if
6(G’) Z a
where a e[0,1].
0 An a-dense. connected subnetwork G’ is called ot-densely connected.

0 A subset of genes V’ C V is called a diﬁ‘erential L-bicluster if there is
a subset {i1,...,iL} C {1, ...,K} such that

D(V)i, =“‘=D(V)iL 6 1+, -}

for all v e V’. That is each gene needs to be consistently differentially
either over- or underexpressed in a subset of samples of size at
least L. As an example. see Figure 2. There. genes G1,G2,G3,G4
(resp. G4, G5,G6, G7) form a differential bicluster with respect to the
samples S1,S2 (resp. S2,S3).

0 An ot-densely connected subnetwork G’ =(V’,E’) where V’ forms a
differential L-bicluster is called a ot-density-constrained L-bicluster.

We would like to devise a strategy by which to tractably mine all
a-density-constrained L-biclusters. To outline our strategy we deﬁne:

0 A graph property is called strong antimonotone if in each graph of
size n with the property every induced subgraph of size n— 1 has the
property.

0 A graph property is called loose antimonotone if in each graph of size
n with the property there is an induced subgraph of size n— 1 with the
property.

Strong antimonotonicity implies loose antimonotonicity. As a simple
example consider graphs where nodes are labeled by either red or blue
color. Clearly. the property to have only red nodes is strong antimonotone:
all subgraphs of a red graph are red. As a simple example for loose
antimonotonicity consider paths: clearly. removing either the start or
the end node results in another. shorter path. However. not every node
can be removediremoving internal nodes splits the path. Another loose
antimonotone property on rediblue graphs is that at least half of the nodes
are red. Removing blue nodes works while removing red nodes does not
necessarily result in a predominantly red colored graph. We make a few
observations:

0 Combining a strong antimonotone with a loose antimonotone results
in a loose antimonotone property. For example. in rediblue colored
graphs. to be a red path is a loose antimonotone property.

0 Combining a loose antimonotone with a loose antimonotone property
does not necessarily result in a loose antimonotone property. Consider
the property (on rediblue colored graphs) to be a path with at least half
of the nodes being red. To see that this is not loose antimonotone take a
path of length 4 where both start and end node are colored red whereas
the two internal nodes are colored blue. Removal of none of the nodes
results in a predominantly red colored path.

In our setting. we obtain the following results where G—v is the subgraph
of G which results from removing v and all edges incident to v:

THEOREM 3.1.
(1) Every subgraph of a diﬁ‘erential bicluster of degree at least L is a
diﬁerential bicluster of degree at least L.

(2) In every connected, weighted-edge graph G: (V,E, w) where 6(G) =
a 3 1/2 there is a node v e V such that G—v is connected aria1 9(G—
v) 301.

(3) In every (a,L)-density-constrained bicluster G=(V,E) where 0.5 5

a 5 1.0 there is a node v e V such that G— v is a a-density-constrained
L-bicluster.

In other words. Theorem 3.1 establishes that to be a differential L-bicluster
is strong antimonotone whereas to be an ot-densely connected graph or to be
a density-constrained bicluster are both loose antimonotone.

PROOF. Strong antimonoticity of differential biclusters is easy. If G is
differentially expressed in L samples then so is any subgraph of G.

Loose antimonotonicity of dense connectivity is a little more tricky. The
arguments proceed in a similar way. while are not completely analogous to
those in Colak (2008) and Moser et al. (2009). Due to space constraints. we
have deferred the proof to the Supplementary Materials.

Since (see above) combining a strong antimonotone with a loose
antimonotone property results in a loose antimonotone property. (3) follows
immediately from (1) and (2). I

3.2 Algorithms

3.2.1 Algorithmic mining strategy Theorem 3.1 supports a search strategy
which is based on the loose antimonotonicity of density-constrained
biclusters and is completely analogous to that of Moser et al. (2009) for
the case 0.5 5 a 5 1.0 which was also employed in Colak et al. (2009). This
strategy will yield all a-density-constrajned L-biclusters U for a e [0.5, 1.0]
which are maximal in the sense that there is no proper ot-density-constrajned
L-bicluster which contains U as an induced subgraph. This strategy applies
for all loose antimonotone properties and therefore applies when mining Ol-
density-constrained L-biclusters. Subnetworks are screened in a breadth-ﬁrst
fashion by starting with subnetworks of size 2 and subsequently neglecting
subnetworks of size n 3 3 which do not contain any density-constrained
bicluster of size n— 1. Loose antimonotonicity guarantees that subnetworks
of size n cannot be density-constrained biclusters if not containing a density-
constrained bicluster of size n — 1. As was also demonstrated in Colak (2008);
Colak et al. (2010) and Moser et al. (2009) this results in a tractable strategy
when combining PPI network with gene expression data. Here. all maximal
density-constrained biclusters were computed in runtimes of at most 273 min
on an ordinary personal computer.

3.2.2 Ranking procedure The resulting set of all density-constrained
biclusters is ranked with respect to statistical signiﬁcance. We randomly
sampled 105 connected subnetworks and determined the P-Value of a density-
constrained L-bicluster G’ as the fraction of randomly sampled subnetworks
H with 9(H)Z€(G’) and H being consistently dysregulated in at least
L samples. We select markers top-down from this P-Value based-ranking
list while discarding biclusters where more than half of the genes are
already contained in previously selected markers. For experiments on breast
cancer. we furthermore reranked our 50 most signiﬁcantly dense modules by
applying the information-theoretic criteria as described for the approaches
which were employed for benchmarking. See Supplementary Materials for
details.

3.3 Datasets and classiﬁcation schemes

3.3.] Network data We downloaded the licensed PPI network from the
STRING database. version 8.1 (Jensen et a1., 2009). STRING provides
several variants of association network where edges come with a conﬁdence
score. Networks can vary in terms of number of proteins. edge content and
conﬁdence scores attached to the edges. In our case. the network consisted
of 9927 proteins and 62 539 edges. Edges have a positive conﬁdence score
in case that there is evidence that the two proteins in question physically
interact within a cellular context. We opted to exclusively treat physical
interactions since comparison partners only considered (ordinary) physical
PPI networks. Note that their methods do not allow to make use of edge
weights. For these methods unweighted PPI network data as described in
Chowdhury and Koyutu'rk (2010) was used.

3.3.2 Colon cancer gene expression data In analogy to Chowdhury
and Koyutiirk’s (2010) study. we treated the microarray datasets with the
accession numbers GSE8671. GSE10950 and GSE6988 from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (Barrett et a1., 2009). GSE8671 contains 8987 gene
expression proﬁles across 32 prospectively collected adenomas with those
of normal mucosa from the same individuals (Sabates-Bellver et a1., 2007).

GSE10950 contains 18 171 gene expression proﬁles across normal and tumor
pairs (J iang et a1., 2008). GSE6988 contains 17 104 gene expression proﬁles
for 25 normal colorectal mucosa. 27 primary colorectal tumors. 13 normal
liver. 27 liver metastasis and 20 primary colorectal tumors without liver
metastasis (Ki et a1., 2007).

3.3.3 Breast cancer gene expression data We considered the gene
expression dataset GSE3494 treated in Miller et al. (2005) along with all
available additional information. Experiments performed in Miller et al.
(2005) aim at predicting TP53 mutation status. tumor grade and survival
time. Therefore. they ﬁrst identify platform-speciﬁc (Affymetrix U133 A
and B) probes as being correlated with TP53 mutation and estrogen receptor
status as well as tumor grade. using multivariate linear regression from their
own data. Subsequently. they select 32 such platform-speciﬁc probes as being
the features which yield best accuracy when performing cross-validation on
their own data. This means that accuracy values cannot be taken as unbiased
results since feature selection is based on the outcome of the cross-validation.

3.3.4 Diﬁ‘erential expression For the colon cancer datasets. GSE8671 and
GSE10950. we determine differential expression as described in Chowdhury
and Koyutu'rk (2010). We ﬁrst normalize expression values for each gene v
individually. Let E(v, j) be the resulting normalized expression value for gene
v in sample j. We then determine the top 10% of the values E(v, j) in each
sample j and declare them ‘overexpressed’. In both datasets samples come in
pairs cancer versus healthy. Let j 1 be the cancer and j; be healthy sample for
one patient 1. We then put D(v)) = +. resp. D(v)) = — if v is overexpressed
in j 1 . but not in jg. resp. the other way round.

In the breast cancer dataset GSE3494 (see below). we determine a normal
distribution for all values and normalize the entire data accordingly. For
an arbitrary sample 1. let E(v, 1) be the corresponding normalized value.
Subsequently. D(v)) = + for a sample 1 if E(v, l) is among the top 5%.
resp. D(v)) = — if E(v,l) is among the lowest 5%.

3.3.5 Classiﬁcation It is performed by a support vector machine approach
implementing a linear kernel using Matlab’s svmclassify. For colon cancer
versus healthy classiﬁcation. the training data are identical with that used
for marker computation (i.e. either GSE8671 or GSE10950). For colon
cancer with versus without liver metastasis. markers are computed using
GSE8671 or GSE10950 and classiﬁcation is performed by leave-one-out
cross-validation in GSE6988. This coincides with the procedures described
in Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010). For breast cancer TP53 wildtype
versus mutant markers are computed using GSE3494 and classiﬁcation is
performed by leave-one-out cross-validation in the same dataset. The breast
cancer classiﬁcation scheme is the only non-cross-platform experiment. In
colon cancer data used for marker computation and classiﬁcation test data
come from two different platforms. For feature space construction. we
choose the best K markers to obtain a feature space of dimension K. Each
sample j is transformed into a K -dimensional vector A(j)ERK where the
entries Amk for each marker k are Amk :=ZVE(v,j)/K where v ranges
over all genes v contained in the subnetwork associated with marker k. In
other words. each sample j becomes a pointAU) in the K -dimensional marker
feature space RK .

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Colon cancer

Overall, we used Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010) as a guideline
and followed their workﬂow for cross-platform predictions.

4.1.1 Marker computation We computed and subsequently
ranked subnetwork markers as described in Section 3 both using
GSE8671 (parameter choices: a=0.5, L=3) and GSE10950 (at:
0.5,L=2). Parameters were chosen as non-restrictive as possible

Cancer subnetwork markers

 

such that the total number of subnetwork markers did not exceed
1000. Throughout this section, our method is referred to as weighted
density-constrained biclustering (wDCB). Since GSE6988 does
not contain paired cancer/control samples one cannot compute
markers as described in Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010) We
also computed and ranked subnetwork markers [greedy mutual
information (GMI)] as described in Chuang et al. (2007), SGM as
described in Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010) and were provided
with subnetwork markers by Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010)
extracted from GSE8671, accordingly ranked (NETCOVER = NC).
However, neither subnetwork markers from GSE10950 nor the
implementation of the NetCover (NC) algorithm were publicly
available at the time when experiments were performed. In the
following, values for Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010) referring
to subnetwork markers extracted from GSE10950 are adopted from
their article.

4.1.2 Classiﬁcation It was performed as described in Section 3,
using support vector machines for both GMI and NC as was
evaluated as yielding maximal predictive power in both cases
(Chowdhury and Koyutiirk, 2010). Predictions refer to predicting
cancer versus healthy tissue, resp. liver metastasis versus non-liver
metastasis (henceforth referred to as ‘Prognosis’) in GSE6988 using
the markers from GSE8671 and GSE10950. Note that we cannot
display certain values referring to markers from GSE10950 for NC
since we were not provided with the corresponding subnetworks nor
the software. In the following, positives (= P) and negatives (= N) are
cancer and healthy resp. liver metastasis and non-liver-metastasis
tissue samples such that true resp. false positives resp. negatives
(= TP, FP, TN, FN) are correctly resp. misclassiﬁed cancer/metastasis
resp. healthy/non-metastasis samples. Figure 3 displays AUC
(area under the precision—recall curve) which is computed as
the arithmetic average of precision (= TP/(TP+FP)) and recall
(=TP/(TP+FN)) for different choices of subnetwork markers and
the two prediction tasks where markers are chosen according to
the corresponding rankings. Note that values for NC using markers
from GSE10950 are missing due to the above-mentioned reasons.
In Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010), an average AUC of 0.86 is
reported for prediction of GSE6988 (wDCB: 0.91, see Table 1 in
the Supplementary Material for more information). See also the
Supplementary, Figure 2 for plots referring to making predictions in
GSE8671 from GSE10950 and vice versa; the corresponding results
are rather negligible—every competitor achieves AUC/accuracy
close to 100%. We recall that GSE6988 is the most difﬁcult dataset,
due to size (123 samples) and comprehensiveness in terms of
subtypes and stages of progression.

We also display Accuracy (= (TP+ TN)/(P +N)) values in Table 1
for predictions using GSE8671 markers, which are available for
all competitors. See also Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 for
more values on cancer versus non-cancer including sensitivity
(recall) and speciﬁcity (=TN/N) which translate to fractions of
correctly predicted cancer resp. healthy samples. We do think
that sensitivity/speciﬁcity/accuracy statistics make most sense.
However, for fairness reasons, we followed the workﬂow scheme of
Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010), which is based on AUC. Overall,
our method outperforms all competitors both when predicting cancer
versus non-cancer and metastasis versus non-metatastis. In the
latter case, when using subnetworks from GSE8671, the increase
in accuracy from 83%, the best value obtained by the competitors,

to 92%, obtained by our method wDCB is quite remarkable. Note
that this is a relative increase of more than 50% (9% out of possible
17%) translating to > 50% less misclassiﬁed samples. In conclusion,
our method proves best on a difﬁcult colon cancer dataset in all
categories tested, raising accuracy beyond 90% as the only method
in three test cases.

4.2 Breast cancer

Here, we use Miller et al. (2005) as a guideline. We focus on
TP53 mutation status and predict wildtype (wt) versus mutant
(mt), a binary classiﬁcation task. We ﬁrst compute markers from
GSE3494 and subsequently employ the suggested leave-one-out
cross-validation scheme in the same dataset. As has been recently
pointed out (Chuang et a1., 2007; Ein-Dor et a1., 2005, 2006) non-
cross-platform evaluations (marker computation and classiﬁcation
are performed in the same dataset) come with two issues: ﬁrst, they
are biased toward markers which do not have to rely on mapping
probes to well-established gene identiﬁers and second, SGMs
traditionally ‘overperform’, i.e. when using them for classiﬁcation
on other platforms their predictive power tends to signiﬁcantly
decrease. We recall that cross-platform stability is a major source of
motivation for subnetwork marker approaches. In the following we
will distinguish between single probe markers (SPMs) that is a SGM
approach making use of all probe data available in GSE3494 even
if probes cannot be mapped (possibly reﬂecting non-coding RNA,
etc.).l SGMs, which is the equivalent of SPM using only mappable
gene probes, GMI (Chuang et a1., 2007) and our approach wDCB
which both rely on mapping probes onto nodes in PPI networks.

 

1The signature genes reported in Miller et al. (2005) are 32 such probes
chosen such as to achieve maximum training accuracy in the cross-validation
scheme.

Fig. 4. Breast cancer: accuracy versus numbers of subnetwork markers
using markers extracted from GSE3494 for predicting TP53 mutation status
(wildtype versus mutant) in GSE3494 (leave-one-out cross-validation).

4.2.1 Marker computation and predictions We computed
markers for SPM, SGM, GMI and wDCB as described in Section 3.
For wDCB, we used parameters a=0.5,L=5 again chosen as
being most non-restrictive while keeping the computed numbers
of subnetworks below 1000. We plotted accuracy versus different
numbers of markers (Fig. 4) and observed that for more than 25
markers none of the methods achieved further improvements. The
non-mappable SPM achieve maximum accuracy for numbers of
markers between 5 and 25, whereas wDCB achieves best values for
choosing only up to 5 top-ranked markers. Among the approaches
generating universally mappable marker sets, wDCB performs best.
Note that, as was reported in previous studies, it is reasonable to
assume that the mappable SGM set SGM will suffer from decreased
performance rates in cross-platform evaluations (Chuang et a1.,
2007; Ein-Dor et a1., 2006) whereas such effects have not been
reported for subnetwork marker approaches. We conclude that our
approach wDCB comes is of substantial value also in breast cancer
subtyping.

4.3 Analysis of our top markers

4.3.1 Markers GSE8671, colon cancer GO enrichment analysis
of the 186 genes identiﬁed in the top subnetworks from GSE8671
revealed a signiﬁcant role for genes involved in the biological
processes of DNA replication, DNA metabolic process, DNA repair
and cell cycle progression (Bonferonni corrected, P < 1e—20).
In particular tumor suppressor genes such as TP53, BRCA1 and mis-
match repair genes MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 all well-characterized
genes known to be involved in colon cancer tumorigenesis (Fearon
and Vogelstein, 1990) are featured in the top-ranked subnetworks.
The top-ranked subnetwork contains TP53 and most of the
minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex components, which
are essential for replication of DNA during cell division. In particular
MCM2 and MCM5, have been shown to be early markers for CRC
(Burger, 2008) and overall almost all CRC display dysregulation of
the TP53 pathway through mutations or other means of functional
inactivation.

4.3.2 Markers GSE3494, breast cancer Here we focused on the
role of TP53, whose expression signature was used previously to
classify prognostic classes in two breast cancer and one liver cancer
cohorts with known TP53 status (Miller et a1., 2005). We found

similar enrichment of GO terms such as DNA replication, DNA
metabolic process and cell cycle progression (Bonferonni corrected,
P<1e—20) in the 174 genes identiﬁed in our top subnetworks
used for classiﬁcation of TP53 mutational status. Furthermore, the
subnetworks identiﬁed for known TP53 status in breast cancer were
comprised of many of the same genes identiﬁed in the colon cancer
subnetwork analysis (65 genes in total, ~35% overlap). Given the
well-characterized role of dysregulated TP53 signaling (e.g. caused
by TP53 mutations) in both colon and breast cancers, these ﬁndings
suggest that in addition to its utility for developing multivariate
classiﬁers, density-constrained biclustering (DCB) may also have
additional functionality for extracting biologically relevant networks
of genes.

See Figure 1 and Table 6 in the Supplementary Material for
pictures and additional statistics on our colon cancer top markers
See also Section 3 and Table 1 in the Supplementary Material
for a comparative enrichment analysis of all subnetwork marker
approaches which reveals that ~75% of our colon cancer top
markers are enriched with GO terms which substantially differs from
other subnetwork approaches (at most 38% of the top markers are
enriched).

5 CONCLUSIONS

Recent studies have strongly conﬁrmed that cancer comes in
a great variety of phenotypes as well as multiple evolutionary
stages. Here we have explicitly addressed this when searching for
systemic subnetwork markers: we employ a biclustering approach—
our markers may apply for several but not all cancer samples
under examination. As a result, we have outperformed the state-
of-the-art approaches, achieving relative increases in prediction
accuracy of ~ 50% in the most demanding cross-platform instances.
Our top-ranked markers contained, for example, well-known
dysregulated genes involved in TP53 signaling. In summary, we
have demonstrated how to combine the usual beneﬁts of systemic
cancer marker approaches with insights on the phenotypical
complexity of cancer.

data sets contain sufﬁciently rich distinguishing features to separate genu-
ine TIS motifs from the false ones.

2.2 Feature generation

For TIS prediction, many useful features in sequences surrounding ATG
signals are reported. Prominent amongst these can be found, for example,
in (Li et al., 2004; Liu and Wong, 2003; Liu et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2006;
Saeys et al., 2007; Tzanis and Vlahavas, 2006). Many of the reported
features are local in the sense that they primarily characterize properties
of the sequences immediately surrounding a candidate TIS. We extended
this set of features with some that are affected by nucleotides up to 150 bp
from the ATG motif site. Since selection of the optimal combination of
candidate features is a combinatorial problem, we ﬁrst reduce the size of
the search space by deﬁning a predetermined subset of features used in all
feature-selection iterations. This ﬁxed subset consists of features that we
selected based on the previously reported results for which we believe to
play a signiﬁcant role in TIS recognition. We expanded the considered
features with a number of new ones. The feature selection method
enlarged the ﬁxed feature set. The core step in our feature selection pro-
cess is the application of genetic algorithm (GA) in search of an optimal
features combination. Brieﬂy, the process stipulates that all candidate
features are numbered and assigned a value of 0 (not selected as a
member of a feature set) or 1 (selected). In this way we form a ‘chromo-
some’ in the GA terms. We use a single point crossover together with
mutation where each bit in a chromosome is subjected to 15% chance of
having its value altered. Finally, we deﬁne evaluation function as the
accuracy of model based on a 3-fold cross-validation on the training
data. Description of major features and more details on feature selection,
training and testing, are given in Supplementary Material 1. A full list of
the used features is given in Supplementary Material 2.

2.3 Main classiﬁer

Our prediction model is an ANN-based classiﬁer. ANNs were used before
for TIS prediction (Pedersen and Nielsen, 1997; Rajapakse and Ho, 2005;
Tikole and Sankararamakrishnan, 2008). We used a 31-node single
hidden-layer ANNs and the backpropagation algorithm for weights opti-
mization. After selecting features using GA, we train the ANN. Available
data, 27 388 positive (real TISs) and 27 388 negative (false TISs) samples,
are split into the training and testing sets. From each of these two sets,
65% (18802) are reserved for model training and the remaining 35%
(9586) for testing. The training data (18 802 positive and 18 802 negative
samples) were further divided into three parts. The ﬁrst one, containing
5000 positive and 5000 negative samples were exclusively used to generate
feature values. The second set containing 10 882 positive and 10 882 nega-
tive samples is used for ANN training. To avoid overﬁtting, the early
stopping with validation method (Prechelt, 1998) is used on the remaining
2920 positive and 2920 negative samples as a validation set.

3 RESULTS

As a representative measure of model performance, we used the
model sensitivity deﬁned as Se=TP/(TP+FN) and speciﬁcity
Sp 2 TN/ (TN + FP), where TP, TN, FF and FN are the numbers
of true positive predictions, true negative predictions, false posi—
tive predictions and false negative predictions, respectively. When
evaluated on the test data only, the performance of our TIS pre—
diction model for A.t. resulted in Se 2 90.75% and Sp 2 90.77%.
When we tested our model on the whole A.t. genome excluding
the training data, we obtained Se 2 90.75% and Sp 2 92.2%. The
tests of our TIS prediction in other plant genomes, with the
unmodiﬁed Arabidopsis model, resulted on Vitis vinifera (entire
chromosomes 1 and 2) in Se=66.8% and Sp=94.4%, and on

Populus trichocarpa (entire chromosome 1) in Se=81.6% and
Sp 2 94.4%. Details are in Supplementary Material 3.

4 CONCLUSION

We developed a web tool for the recognition of TIS motifs in
plant genomic DNA sequences that is based on an ANN classi—
fier. Model features are selected by a GA as a part of the model
optimization process. The model demonstrates not only an im—
proved prediction accuracy over the reported TIS predictors
for A.t., but also performs well on two other plant species for
which it was not speciﬁcally trained. We hope that our tool will
find good use in studies and annotation of gene properties of
plants and may provide a further insight into the mechanisms
of translation initiation.

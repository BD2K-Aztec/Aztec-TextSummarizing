patterns in the enzyme subset of sequences. All components are trained
separately for sequences annotated up to 3EC and 4EC numbers. The
classiﬁcation tree as reported in Arakaki et al., 2009 is implemented to
integrate predictions generated by each of six components into a ﬁnal EC
number prediction.

For annotation and reannotation of genomes for enzyme functions,
genomic sequences were downloaded from the ftp site of the ENSEMBL
genomes database (release 13) for 249 bacterial, 26 fungi, 15 protists, 16
plants and 35 metazoans. An additional 55 vertebrate species genomes
were downloaded from ENSEMBL release 67. All alternate spliced ver-
sions for a gene were considered in the detection of enzyme function.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

EFICAZZ'S is the latest implementation of the high—precision
enzyme function prediction method EFICAz that was trained
with the latest data sets for the SWISSPROT, PFAM and
PROSITE. We implemented changes in the software code that
make it easier for a user to upgrade by requiring only the re—
placement of the directory containing the library ﬁles. EFICAzz'5
takes about 4 min for a typical 200—residue protein compared
with 6 min by EFICAzz. The results on the web interface are
more informative and include the EC name, EC number and
relevant links to the EC, BRENDA and KEGG resources. The
results of user queries performed using SWISSPROT ID are
stored at the backend, and subsequent queries for the same ID
immediately retrieve the results. This version uses a total number
of 220 485 sequences whose EC numbers are provided by the
ENZYME data set of curated SWISSPROT sequences as com—
pared with only 136 167 sequences available in 2008 when the
previous version, EFICAzz, was built. In terms of the diversity of
enzymatic functions, the current release contains a total of 2757
4EC numbers compared with 2354 in the previous version. The
diversity of functions is seen only at the 4EC level, as the number
of 3EC digit functions only increases from 209 to 211.
Benchmarking results when 80% of the sequences from every
EC function were used for training while testing on the remain—
ing 20% of sequences (only families with >5 sequences were
used) shows a similar trend of high precision and recall values
as a function of the maximum test to training sequence identity
(MTTSI). At a sequence similarity of >40% for 3 EC level, recall
and precision values were 0.88 and 0.85, respectively, and
reached almost 1.0 at a MTTSI of >60%. Even at a MTTSI
of 20%, the precision and recall were 0.8 and 0.6, respectively,
at the 4EC level. However, both drop rapidly as the MTTSI
became <20% (see Supplementary Fig. S1). This is not surpris—
ing, as this lies well within the twilight zone for function predic—
tion. Supplementary Figure S2 shows a comparison of
EFICAzz'5 and EFICAz2 for all sequences in the latest release
in SWISSPROT.

In another comparison analysis, we compared the EC anno—
tations made by EFICAz2 and EFICAzz'5 for the human prote—
ome. The latest release of the human proteome consists of 2856
sequences annotated with EC numbers in ENZYME database.
EFICAZZ'S could predict all four digits of 2642 sequences cor—
rectly compared with 2288 sequences by EFICAzz. In addition,
EFICAZZ'S predicted 30 sequences at a low conﬁdence level. At

the 3EC level, EFICAzz'5 predicted 2758 sequences correctly as
compared with 2,413 by EFICAz2.This shows that EFICAzz'5
has better prediction ability compared with its predecessor. In
addition, EFICAzz'5 predicts EC numbers for a total of 8886 of
50 475 sequences in the translated TrEMBL component of the
human proteome.

Advancements in sequencing technologies have resulted in the
full genome sequencing of a variety of organisms. After sequen—
cing, the next obvious step is the annotation of the functions of
genes. Among various roles played by proteins, enzymatic func—
tion is the most important from the biochemical point of View.
We took this opportunity to reannotate 4 044 586 sequences
from a total of 396 genomes from the ENSEMBL database
using EFICAzz'S. The results will be updated with each release
of ENSEMBL and ENSEMBL genomes.

Prediction results are obtained at two levels: viz. ‘high conﬁ—
dence’ and ‘all prediction’ (Tian et al., 2004). Supplementary
Table S1 shows a summary of predictions at the 3EC and 4EC
digit levels for various groups of organisms. In any case, extant
accurate enzyme annotations represent the lower bound of en—
zymatic functions for an organism. This data can be used by the
biochemist and computational biologist alike. We believe
EFICAzz'5 will be a useful tool for the scientiﬁc community.

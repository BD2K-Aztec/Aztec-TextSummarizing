Note: For SwarmDock, results are shown for all 176 structures in the Benchmark 4.0, as well as the subset of 29 structures. Results are given when considering only the lowest energy member of each cluster, or all members of

each cluster. For ClusPro, results are shown when using the balanced ClusPro scoring function and the electrostatically biased scoring function. The other scoring functions evaluated did not perform as well and are not shown.

3 BENCHMARK

Benchmark 4.0 (Hwang et al., 2010) is the most current and up to
date benchmark for docking algorithms. Unbound structures
were repaired by the SwarmDock server and all the 176 cases
(121 rigid body, 30 medium difﬁculty, 25 difficult) were
re—docked, from the unbound receptor/ligand conformations.
The server correctly parsed the structures and returned results
for all 176 cases. The docking was evaluated by calculating inter—
face RMSD, ligand RMSD and the fraction of native and
non—native contacts, and solutions were then classiﬁed as incor—
rect, acceptable, medium or high quality, in accordance with the
CAPRI criteria (Lensink et al., 2007). The detailed results are
presented in the Supplementary Material. The success rate for
blind docking, the number of complexes for which at least one
acceptable solution was found, is 71.6%. A more detailed ana—
lysis of the results is shown in Table 1.

We also benchmarked SwarmDock against ClusPro, a popular
proteiniprotein docking server (Comeau et al., 2004). ClusPro has
consistently outperformed all other servers in the previous and
current CAPRI assessment periods, and thus represents the
state—of—the—art. We chose a subset of structures to compare the
servers: all 19 medium difﬁculty and difficult complexes from
update 4.0 of the Benchmark and 10 rigid—body complexes
chosen uniformly. ClusPro returned solutions for all 29 cases. In
7 cases, both servers did not ﬁnd a solution. In 9 cases, SwarmDock
found a correct solution whereas ClusPro did not, and there were
no cases of ClusPro finding a solution where SwarmDock
could not. Further comparison between the servers is presented
in Table l, which also shows the higher performance of Swarm
Dock in terms of the quality of docked solutions and their ranking.

4 CONCLUSONS

The SwarmDock server is a tool for predicting the three—
dimensional structure of proteiniprotein complexes. Uploaded
structures are automatically repaired, and the server is robust
and easy to use. Docking may be performed in two modes: as
full blind when nothing is known about interface residues, or in
restrained mode, when information about interface residues may
be used to restrict the search space. For the full blind mode, tests
were performed on the most recent docking benchmark, achiev—
ing a success rate of 71.6% when considering all solutions, and
36.4% when considering only the top 10. The full blind mode
was also compared with ClusPro, the most successful docking
server to date. The SwarmDock algorithm has also been used for
generating structures for one of highest performing groups in
CAPRI, and the automated server presented here has correctly
identiﬁed the structure of all three complexes in the CAPRI
rounds it has participated in, including two targets for which
no other servers returned correct results.

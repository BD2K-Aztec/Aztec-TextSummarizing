Abstract

Motivation: A growing number of studies have explored the process of pre—implantation embry—
onic development of multiple mammalian species. However, the conservation and variation
among different species in their developmental programming are poorly defined due to the lack of
effective computational methods for detecting co—regularized genes that are conserved across spe—
cies. The most sophisticated method to date for identifying conserved co—regulated genes is a two—
step approach. This approach first identifies gene clusters for each species by a cluster analysis of
gene expression data, and subsequently computes the overlaps of clusters identified from different
species to reveal common subgroups. This approach is ineffective to deal with the noise in the ex—
pression data introduced by the complicated procedures in quantifying gene expression.
Furthermore, due to the sequential nature of the approach, the gene clusters identified in the first
step may have little overlap among different species in the second step, thus difficult to detect con—
served co—regulated genes.

Results: We propose a cross—species bi—clustering approach which first denoises the gene expres—
sion data of each species into a data matrix. The rows of the data matrices of different species
represent the same set of genes that are characterized by their expression patterns over the devel—
opmental stages of each species as columns. A novel bi—clustering method is then developed to
cluster genes into subgroups by a joint sparse rank—one factorization of all the data matrices. This
method decomposes a data matrix into a product of a column vector and a row vector where the
column vector is a consistent indicator across the matrices (species) to identify the same gene clus—
ter and the row vector specifies for each species the developmental stages that the clustered genes
co—regulate. Efficient optimization algorithm has been developed with convergence analysis. This
approach was first validated on synthetic data and compared to the two—step method and several
recent joint clustering methods. We then applied this approach to two real world datasets of gene
expression during the pre—implantation embryonic development of the human and mouse. Co—
regulated genes consistent between the human and mouse were identified, offering insights into
conserved functions, as well as similarities and differences in genome activation timing between
the human and mouse embryos.

Availability and Implementation: The R package containing the implementation of the proposed
method in C++is available at: https://github.com/JavonSun/mvbc.git and also at the R platform

1 Introduction

The process of mammalian pre—implantation embryonic development
is characterized by the degradation of maternal RNA stored in the 00—
cytes and the gradual activation of the embryonic genome. Rapid ad—
vances in the whole—genome RNA sequencing techniques has led to a
growing number of studies exploring gene regulation during pre—
implantation embryonic development in different species (Blakeley
et (11., 2015; Cao et (11., 2014; Graf et (11., 2014; Jiang et (11., 2014; Xue
et (11., 2013; Yan et (11., 2013). Several studies have shown that the
timing of embryonic genome activation varies by species (Braude
et (11., 1988; Cao et (11., 2014; Graf et (11., 2014; Hamatani et (11.,
2004; Jiang et (11., 2014; Misirlioglu et (11., 2006; Wang et (11., 2004).
The understanding of this variation may bring insights into embryonic
developmental programming and species differences. Identifying the
co—regulated gene clusters that are conserved across species is a key
component in the understanding of this variation (Jiang et (11., 2014;
Xue et (11., 2013). Such conserved gene clusters are likely involved in
common biological processes that are fundamental to the embryonic
development of mammals. However, due to the lack of effective com—
putational methods, there has been limited understanding of the con—
servation of gene co—regulation during embryonic development.

In a typical study of mammalian embryonic development, ex—
pression levels of all genes are collected at multiple developmental
milestones (stages), such as oocytes, 2—cell and 8—cell embryos. Gene
expression data of different species are analyzed and compared to
understand the similarities and variations in the embryonic develop—
ment of the species. The most sophisticated method available so far
for identifying conserved co—regulated genes consists of two steps in
sequence (Jiang et (11., 2014; Xue et (11., 2013). First, co—regulated
gene clusters are identified in each individual species by performing
a cluster analysis of their gene expression data, usually by a hier—
archical clustering method. Second, by computing overlaps among
identified clusters in different species, co—regulated gene clusters that
are conserved among species may be found. This two—step approach
can be ineffective in two ways. There are innegligible noises in the
expression data resulted from the complicated procedures in quan—
tifying gene expression. The noises may prevent the detection of bio—
logically meaningful and important gene clusters for each species
(Jiang et (11., 2014). Moreover, the clusters identified in the first step
may have no overlaps in the second step, thus unable to identify con—
served gene clusters. In this paper, we address these two issues by
proposing a novel cross—species bi—clustering approach.

A variety of methods have been proposed to reduce noise from a
dataset, such as those for smoothing out noise, or identifying and
removing outliers (Han et (11., 2011). However, a proper and
effective noise reduction method is problem—specific. To identify co-
regnlated gene clusters, we search for genes that exhibit similar
expression patterns over the embryonic developmental stages. We
define that an expression pattern (or simply a pattern) is a specific
series of high and low expression levels over a set of developmental
stages. For example, in a study with three stages: oocytes, 2—cell and
4—cell embryos, the sequence of [big/7, low, low] is a pattern that a
gene may follow, indicating that the gene has high expression level
in oocytes, but low levels in the 2—cell and 4—cell stages. In order to
reduce noise and focus on the biologically confirmed gene expres—
sion patterns, we propose to transform the raw gene expression data
to reﬂect how closely the expression levels follow known patterns.
In the new data matrix, rows represent genes and each column cor—
responds to a pattern in a pre—compiled list of patterns. Each gene is
measured by the similarity between its gene expression path and
each of the patterns in the list.

Instead of a separate cluster analysis for each species, we propose
to integrate gene expression data of multiple species to search for con—
firmatory co—regulated gene clusters directly. This integrative way of
data analysis allows the searching process to target at the gene clusters
that show similar patterns across species. The multi—species joint clus—
ter analysis corresponds to a machine learning principle: multi—view
cluster analysis (Sun et (11., 2015), where the same set of subjects (i.e.
genes here) is viewed in different input spaces, particularly here, in the
developmental stages of different species. Further, we need to deter—
mine the expression patterns in each view (i.e. the columns in each
data matrix) that are responsible for the grouping of subjects. Multi—
view cluster analysis aims to group subjects into clusters in the same
way no matter which view of data is used. However, most of the
existing multi—view clustering methods assume that all columns in the
data contribute equally in determining the clusters (Cai et (11., 2013;
Chaudhuri et (11., 2009; Cheng et (11., 2013; Culp and Michailidis,
2009; Kumar and Daume, 2011; Langfelder and Horvath, 2008; Liu
et (11., 2013). These methods cannot identify the specific patterns that
the clustered genes actually follow. Even though a gene may follow
multiple known patterns, the number of these patterns is much
smaller than the total amount of pre—compiled biological patterns.
Hence, these existing multi—view clustering methods are not suitable
for solving our problem. We recently proposed two new multi—view
bi—clustering methods (Sun et (11., 2014, 2015) that can identify con—
sistent clusters across views and simultaneously specify a subset of
variables in each view on which the genes in a cluster show high simi—
larity. However, the algorithm developed in Sun et al. (2014), al—
though is efficient, has not obtained a theoretical guarantee for
convergence so far. The method in Sun et al. (2015) requires to pre—
determine the cluster size (i.e. the number of genes in a cluster) before
the algorithm can be applied, which is obviously difficult to estimate
for the gene co—regulation problem.

In this paper, we thus propose another new multi—view bi—cluster—
ing method that identifies both the gene clusters consistent across mul—
tiple species (views) and the expression patterns of the clustered genes
for each species. By a sparse rank—one matrix factorization, this
method decomposes a data matrix into a product of a sparse column
vector and a sparse row vector. The non—zero entries of these vectors
indicate the gene clusters and the selected expression patterns, respect—
ively. We propose to use another sparse column vector to link the dif—
ferent data matrices. This column vector is used to enforce that the
decomposed column vectors from every view correspond to the same
subset of genes. The resultant optimization problem can be solved ef—
ficiently by developing an alternating optimization algorithm.
Compared to the methods in Sun et al. (2014,2015), the proposed
method is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point and does not
require any prior knowledge of cluster size. We compared the pro—
posed method in simulations to the traditional two—step approach,
and several latest multi—view clustering methods developed by others,
which demonstrated the superiority of our method. We then used the
proposed approach to analyze the pre—implantation embryonic devel—
opment datasets of the human and mouse. Across the two species, 22
co—regulated gene clusters were identified to be conserved. A gene
ontology analysis of the identified genes showed that they are
involved in many fundamental biological networks. The expression
patterns associated with these clusters were compared between the
human and mouse embryos, showing that there are both similarities
and variations between the human and mouse in the gene activation
timing during the early development.

We brieﬂy introduce the notation used throughout this paper.
We use a bold—font upper case letter such as X to represent a matrix,
a bold—font lower case letter such as v to denote a column vector,

and a lower case letter such as a to represent a scalar. We denote
the component of X at the 1th row and jth column by X(i, /) or x,,-,
and the 1th row and jth column of M, respectively, by X(i, -), and
X(-,/'). Similarly, we use v(i) to denote the ith component of v.
The Frobenius norm of a matrix X is denoted by  (P which is cal—
culated as Z,- ZI- lxiilz. Further, the £1—norm of a vector v
is denoted by  l1 and calculated as Z,- lvil, where 1/,- is its ith com—
ponent. The operator 2 G u is the element wise product of z and 11.
We use an italic upper case letter as S to represent a set of elements.

2 Pattern preserving noise reduction

We start from introducing our noise reduction technique that aims
to preserve the important expression patterns identified in the litera—
ture or in hypothesized biological processes. A list of patterns can be
pre—compiled by collecting them from the current literature of
embryonic development. Note that expression patterns can also be
created by a biological hypothesis, and our algorithm will automat—
ically evaluate if the patterns are useful for identifying conserved co—
regulated genes. If a specific analysis is not interested in a known
pattern, the pattern can be excluded from the list. Particularly in this
paper, we have compiled 22 and 18 gene expression patterns, re—
spectively, for the human and mouse pre—implantation embryonic
developmental processes. (Readers can consult with Tables 2 and 3
in Section 5 for details.)

Although the actual gene expression data are continuous, the pat—
terns are represented by discretized expression levels. For instance, if
seven developmental stages: oocytes, pronucleus, zygote, 2—cell, 4—cell,
8—cell and morula, are considered, a gene is expressed high in oocytes,
medium in pronucleus but low in the rest of the stages. This gene may
be characterized by the following two patterns: a pattern with a big/7
value in oocytes and a low value for all subsequent stages, or another
pattern with a big/7 value in both oocytes and pronucleus but a low
value for the other stages. If we summarize all patterns using binary
levels such as high and low, we can represent each of the two patterns
by a 7—entry vector: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] where 1
means big/7 and 0 means low.

We transform a gene’s expression levels at the different develop—
mental stages into a vector of length that is equal to the number of
pre—compiled patterns (e.g. d). Let p represent a pattern and its val—
ues at the different developmental stages form a vector denoted by
y. Let g represent the actual gene expression of a gene and its values
at the different stages form another vector denoted by x. The correl—
ation between the two random variables p and g is computed as
follows:

COVUL g)

cor(p,g) I m

7

where cov(p, g) is the sample covariance of p and g and calculated

as:
COVULg) 2 Zim- — 
var(p) and var(g) are sample variance and can be calculated as;
var<p> 2 2y? — 
and
var(g) 2 2.x; _ 

respectively. Given a threshold t, we can determine that the gene g
follows the pattern p if cor(p, g) 2 t. Hence, the expression levels of
a specific gene g are converted into a binary vector of length d where
a value of 1 indicates that the gene follows (is highly correlated to)
the corresponding pattern, and a value of 0 means otherwise. The
transformed data matrix for a species is an n X d matrix of binary
values where n represents the number of genes.

3 Multi-view bi-clustering

3.1 Sparse rank—one matrix factorization
Given a data matrix and of n genes and d variables, its rank—one
matrix factorization can be represented by uvT, where vector u is of
length n and vector v is of length d. When we enforce u and v to be
sparse, the optimal factorization captures the most prominent block
structure in X because the rows and columns included in a block (as
indicated by the non—zero entries of u and v) naturally form row and
column clusters, respectively. More precisely, the rows correspond—
ing to non—zero values in 11 form a row (subject) cluster. The col—
umns corresponding to non—zero values in v form a column
(variable) cluster. This is illustrated in Figure 1, where darker color
indicates a larger value at the corresponding position in X assuming
all values in X are positive.

The optimal sparse rank—one matrix factorization of X can be
found by solving the following optimization problem:

minllX-UVTll§+/lullull1+ivllVll1- (1)

The term llX — ule  is for achieving the closest approximation
of X, while Aul lul l1 and 2,) lvl )1 enforce the sparsity of u and v. This
optimization problem can be efficiently solved by alternatively solv—
ing two subproblems until convergence: (i) solving v while fixing u,
(ii) solving u while fixing v. Both of the two subproblems have an
analytical solution, which will be discussed in detail in Section 4.
Problem (1) is different from sparse singular value decomposition as
in Lee et al. (2010) because both 11 and v are not required to be unit
vectors, and we do not have a scalar, i.e. the singular value in Lee
et al. (2010), involved in Problem (1) as a variable. The bi—convexity
of our formulation (which is convex in terms of n and 1/ when one of
them is fixed) ensures a better convergence property for the alternat—
ing algorithm. We will discuss this in more detail when the optimiza—
tion algorithm is introduced in Section 4.

3.2 Multi—view sparse rank—one matrix factorization

We have discussed how we obtain gene clusters and their associated
variables using the data matrix of one species in one view. Now we
introduce the procedure to obtain consistent gene clusters across

multiple views and simultaneously identify their associated variables
in each view. We propose to use a common vector 2 to link together
the rank—one matrix factorization of multiple data matrices. Let m
be the number of views, the proposed formulation is as follows:

m
minleX, _ (z e u,)v,Tjj§.

 1.:1
m m

+lzllzll1+ Ziuillmlh + Elwillwllr
i:1 i:1

Here, we enforce z to be sparse for identifying common gene cluster
across all views because when a component in z is zero, 11 will auto—
matically have a value of zero at the corresponding position.

Let 2, E and v, be the optimal solution of Problem (2). There are
two different approaches to obtaining gene clusters by inspecting i
and ﬁ,. One way is to look for none zero entries in z and construct
cluster by including all instances with none zero entry in z. The other
approach is to form cluster by including only subjects with non—zero
entries in all ﬁi. Let A and B be the two sets of subjects in the clusters
defined by first and second approach, respectively. Let C,- be the set
of subjects with none zero in E. Since any subject with zero in i has
zero in every E, and also any subject with zero in all E has zero in
2, so we have A : UC,-. In addition, we have B : QC,- by definition,
so A 2 B. The choice between these two options depends on the na—
ture of the problem being solved. In an application, such as identify—
ing conserved co—regulated gene clusters, where tight clusters from
the angle of each view are required, the latter approach is more fa—
vorable. While for applications where the objective is to find latent
structures among subjects, such as a disease subtyping study with
data from both phenotypic and genotypic views (Sun et al., 2014),
the first approach may be used.

The optimal solution of Problem (2) leads to the identification of
a gene cluster and its associated variables in each view. When mul—
tiple clusters are needed, we can obtain the subsequent gene clusters
by repeatedly solving Problem (2) with X,- replaced by a residual ma—
trix Xi. There are two ways to create X,- from X,- and the sparse
rank—one approximation an} of X,-. One way is to calculate the dif—
ference between X,- and my}, i.e. X : X,- — an}. The other way is
to exclude the rows corresponding to all the subjects in the identified
cluster from X,-. The first approach may lead to a cluster solution
that assigns a subject to more than one cluster whereas the clusters
resulted from the second way are always mutually exclusive. The se—
cond approach was used in our experiment.

4 Optimization

In this section, we propose a computational algorithm to solve
Problem (2) by following the block coordinate decent (BCD) frame—
work (Tseng, 2001). We start with a brief introduction of soft—
thresholding rule for solving the minimization problem bellow, as it
is used frequently in our algorithm.

minx2 —20rx+2/)’lxl, (3)

where or and l)’ > 0 are two constants. Let  : x2 — 20m + 2p’lxl,
we have:

c—w—mt—w—mz x>o

(x—(0€+l)’))2—(0t+l)’)2 x<0.

When at > I}, (or —  minimizes f(x) when x > 0 with minimum —
(or — [if and 0 minimizes f(x) when x g 0 with 0 being the min—
imum. Obviously, —(or — p’)2 < 0, so (or — [3) is the overall minim—
izer when or >  Similarly, when at < —/)’,  minimizes f(x)
with —(or + [if being the minimum; and when  < I}, 0 minimizes
f(x) with minimum 0. Collectively, Problem (3) has an analytical so—
lution that can be summarized as follows:

or—l)’ or>/)’
97: 0 ldlél)’ (4)
or+/)’ or<—/)’.

This is the so called soft—thresholding rule for solving Problem (3).

In our algorithm, we iteratively search for the optimal z, ui’s and
vi’s. In each iteration, we alternatively search for optimal z, ui’s and
vi’s in sequence by solving one with fixing the other two. When 2 is
fixed, both the two subproblems of finding optimal u,- with fixed v,-
and finding optimal v,- with fixed 11,- are independent among views,
thus can be solved separately for each view and in parallel.

(a) Solving for u,- when 2 and v,- are fixed

When 2 and v,- are fixed, and 11,- remains as the only variable,
Problem (2) is reduced to:
minllxi—(ieuiwilliwllmllr. <5>
where i and v,- are constant. By expanding both the Frobenius norm
and £1—norm, this sub—problem can be transformed to:

min Z(X,(j,k) — 2(/)v,-(Ie>ui(/>>2 + Z Muir/M-
“" H: i

Since there is no interacting terms among components of u,-, each
component u,-(j) can be solved independently. After excluding all
constant terms, the optimal u,-(j) can be found by optimizing:

and the soft—thresholding rule as in Eq. (4) can be applied by setting
or : army) and l)’ : [rum to obtain optimal u,-(/') as follows:

“um - (inn) “um > (inn)

(b) Solving for v,- when 2 and u,- are fixed
When 2 and u,- are fixed to i and 11,-, respectively, the sub—
problem of Problem (2) with v,- being the only variable can be writ—
ten as:
. ~ ~ T 2
mtnllXi-(ZGWMllp+/lmllVill1- (7)
By expanding the Frobenius norm and £1—norm, this sub—problem
can be transformed to:

Similar to sub—problem (5), here we also have no interacting terms
among components of v,-, so each of its components v,-(l2) can also
be solved independently. The sub—problem for solving v,-(l2) is as

follows:

(6) Solving for 2 while u,- and v,- are fixed
When u,- and v,- are fixed to 11,- and vi, Problem (2) is reduced
to:

minZllXi-(Z®ﬁi)Vill§+/lzllzll1- <9>

As in both (a) and (b), it can be shown that each component of 2
can be solved independently. Let

We summarize our algorithm in Algorithm (1 ).

Given a function f (x), its directional derivative at a point z in its do—
main along a direction dis calculated as:

for all d. In addition, when

we say 2 is a stationary point of 
For simplifying the presentation, we use f (z, u,,v,-) to represent
the objective function of Problem (2). Let

then we have:

f(Zaui7Vi) : fo(Zaui7Vi) +fz(Z) +fu.»(ui) +fv.(Vi)- (11)

Theorem 1: Let {(z, u,-, v,-)r} be a sequence generated by Algorithm 1,
every limit point of {(z, u,-, v,)r} is a stationary point of f (z, u,-, v,).

Proof: First, the overall function f (z, u,-, v,-) is continuous on its en—
tire domain Rp, here p is the total number of components of z, u,-
and v,- combined. Second, it can be easily shown that fo(z,u,-,v,-) is
Gateaux differentiable with respect to all the variables: 2, u,- and vi.
Third, all the three sub—problems, i.e. Problem (6), (8) and (10) have
one unique optimal solution, which can be found analytically as in
Eq. (6), (8) and (10). According to Theorem (4.1) in Tseng (2001),
for an optimization problem as shown in Eq. (2) with its objective
function generally formatted as in Eq. (11), when f is a continuous,
f0 is Gateaux is differentiable and has open domain, and all the sub—
problems, i.e. problems that are solved for variables in one block
while fixing those in all others, have unique solution, every limit
point generated by a block coordinate decent (BCD) algorithm, such
as our Algorithm (1), is a stationary point of This leads to our
conclusion. El

5 Results

We first evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method using syn—
thetic data, and subsequently applied it to two real world datasets of
pre—implantation embryonic development in the human and mouse.
To demonstrate its advantage, we compared the proposed multi—view
bi—clustering method with several existing approaches using synthetic
data where we know the ground truth. The compared methods in—
clude both base line approaches and advanced multi—view clustering
methods that are recognized as the state of art in the machine learning
field. These methods are brieﬂy describes as follows:

' Single view overlap: This is the traditionally and commonly used
two—step approach, i.e. clustering analysis in each view separ—
ately followed by the computation of overlaps among clusters
from different views (Jiang et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2013). We
ran this two—step approach with both the hierarchical clustering
as implemented in tool WGCNA (Langfelder and Horvath,
2008) and the bi—clustering via sparse rank—one matrix factoriza—
tion as the clustering method on each view.

' Kernel addition/product: Radial basis function (RBF) kernels of
all views are combined via addition or component wise product.
Spectral clustering was subsequently applied to the combined
kernel to obtain clusters.

' Feature concatenation: Data from all views were simply arranged
together by feature concatenation and the REF kernel of this
combined data was calculated and used in spectral clustering to
obtain clusters.

' Co-trained spectral: Homogeneous kernels among views are
sought via iterative search. In each iteration, the kernel of one
view is updated with information from the remaining views.
Spectral clustering was subsequently used with these homoge—
neous kernels to obtain clusters (Kumar and Daume, 201 1).

' Co-regularized spectral: This method also performs joint spectral
clustering (Kumar et al., 2011). The eigendecomposition of the
graph Laplacian of all views is linked to obtain homogeneous
eigenvectors that are used subsequently in k—means to obtain
clusters.

5.1 Simulation study
We simulated datasets with implanted block structures that give
both clusters of subjects and variables by mimicking datasets from a
real study in which genes are characterized with expression patterns.
Two views of data for 1000 subjects were created. There were 12
variables in view 1, and 15 variables in view 2. The data matrix of
each view is created by randomly setting 0 or 1 to each entry with
varying probability that is determined according to prefixed block
structures projected in the data. More specifically, we start from a
data matrix filled with all 0. Then we reset data entries inside and
outside the blocks to 1 with probability 0.9 and 0.1, respectively.
For simplifying the process and easy presentation, we had subjects
in the two datasets well aligned and indexed from 1 to 1000; and
variables were also indexed using consecutive number starting from
1. View 1 was designed to have two blocks. The first block consists
of subjects from 1 to 400 and variables from 1 to 3. The second in—
cludes the 200 subjects indexed from 481 to 680 and variables from
4 to 6. Three blocks were included in view 2. The first block con—
tains subjects from 1 to 240 and the first three variables. The second
block consists of subjects from 241 to 480 and variable 4, 5 and 6.
The last block includes 320 subjects indexed from 481 to 800 and
variables from 7 to 9. By comparing blocks of the two views, it is
obvious that there are three consistent blocks (i.e. containing same
subjects) between the two views. Variables of each view and number
of subjects in these blocks are provided in Table 1. Block 1 consists
of 240 subjects and contains variables from 1 to 3 in both view.
There are 200 subjects in block 2. The corresponding variables are
4, 5 and 6 in view 1 and 7, 8 and 9 in view 2. Block 3 consists of
160 subjects and contains variables from 1 to 3 in view 1 and vari—
ables from 4 to 6 in view 2.

We randomly generated six datasets using the settings as
described above. For each dataset, all compared methods were run

ent blocks between the two views of the synthetic datasets

to obtain four clusters. Three out of the four clusters correspond to
the three consistent blocks, respectively, in the data; and the remain—
ing one corresponds to the set including all other subjects. The nor—
malized mutual information (NMI) by comparing the cluster
solution resulted from each method with the true solution (blocks) is
calculated to measure their performance. It ranges from 0 to 1. A
higher value indicates stronger consistency between the two com—
pared cluster solutions.

The mean and standard deviation of NMIs obtained by all
compared methods on the six synthetic datasets are presented in
Figure 2. For single view overlap, only the results obtained when bi—
clustering via sparse rank—one matrix factorization was used as the
clustering method are reported, as they are better than that when
hierarchical clustering was used. The proposed multi—view bi—clus—
tering method is labeled with MVBC. It has the highest mean NMI
0.8576 with standard deviation 0.0135, which is significantly higher
than that of all other compared methods, and thus has the best per—
formance. In order to have a better idea on what the consistent
blocks identified by each method look like, we draw data matrix
plots in Figure 3 with subjects arranged according to their block as—
signments determined by each method on one of the six synthetic
datasets. That is data points from the same identified block are plot—
ted together. These data matrix plots also demonstrate the advan—
tage of MVBC by showing that it uncovers the true blocks with
minor and the least mismatching when comparing to the others. The
superior performance of MVBC over the traditional two—step ap—
proach demonstrates the improved power of joint multi—view ana—
lysis in identifying consistent clusters. The observation that it
outperforms all other compared multi—view clustering methods
shows the advantage of performing subspace space searching in the
situation where consistent clusters are determined by only subset of
variables in the data.

5.2 Case study: the human and mouse embryonic
development

We applied the proposed method to two datasets that were collected
respectively for the human and mouse embryonic development. The
two datasets were downloaded from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo
with accessing number GSE44183 and have been used in previous
studies (Jiang et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2013). Both gene expression
datasets were obtained from single cell RNA sequencing. There are

14 766 genes and seven embryonic development stages, oocytes,
pronucleus, zygote, 2—cell, 4—cell, 8—cell and morula, in the human
dataset. For the mouse, gene expression levels of 13 879 genes at six
embryonic development stages, oocytes, pronucleus, 2—cell, 4—cell,
8—cell and morula, are available. Because we aimed to identify co—
regulated gene clusters conserved during the human and mouse em—
bryo development, the 11 018 common genes in both datasets were
included in the analysis.

Gene expression patterns used in our analysis consisted of both
those identified by existing works (Jiang et al., 2014; Xue et al.,
2013)and those that might be present in the embryonic development
indicated in literatures (Blakeley et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2014; Graf
et al., 2014; Hamatani et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004; Yan et al.,
2013; Zeng et al., 2004). For humans, we aggregated 22 gene ex—
pression patterns as listed in Table 2. We compiled a list of 18 pat—
terns for the mouse, which are listed in Table 3.

We first reformatted the raw data of gene expression levels of
genes, so gene regulations are directly characterized by the expres—
sion patterns included. We used 0.75 as the cutoff threshold: t (as
described in Section 2) while performing the reformatting. Then we
ran the proposed multi—view bi—clustering method with the two
reformatted datasets to identify conserved co—regulated gene clusters
between the two species. As we know, co—regulated genes suggest
their involvement in a common network of biological processes and
functions. Moreover, conservation of co—regulations among differ—
ent species implies that the corresponding biological processes and
functions are fundamental to all species studied. For further under—
standing of the conserved co—regulated gene clusters obtained by
running our approach, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis
using DAVID (Huang da et al., 2009) for all clusters. Lastly, we
compared the expression patterns that are associated with the same
clusters in both species to reveal the similarities and differences in
developmental programing.

Out of the 22 clusters, seven were relatively large, i.e. clusters
C1—2, C4, C5, C7 and C9—10, with more than 100 genes in each.
Analysis of the functions of genes in these clusters revealed that they
are engaged in fundamental biological processes. More specifically,
the 1042 co—regulated genes in C1 are involved in cell death and sur—
vival; the 1510 co—regulated genes in C2 are engaged in RNA post—
transcriptional modification, protein synthesis, cellular growth and
proliferation; and the 765 co—regulated genes in C4 are involved in
cell cycle, gene expression and cellular assembly and organization.
Moreover, genes engaged in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism,
DNA replication, embryonic development and cellular function and
maintenance are also co—regulated with many others in both species
as indicated by clusters C5, C7 and C9—10. The remaining 15 clus—
ters (i.e. C3, C6, C8 and C11—22) are small. The GO analysis of
genes in these clusters shows significant over—representation of genes
involved in transcription, translation, reproduction, sex differenti—
ation, mitochondrial functions and stem cell maintenance, which
implies that genes involved in these biological functions are co—
regulated in humans and mice in a conserved fashion.

Intriguingly, several clusters contain the co—regulated genes that
follow similar expression patterns between the human and mouse
embryos. Of note, genes in clusters C2, C4 and C6 shows similar

expression pattern and are highly expressed at morula in both spe—
cies. These genes are involved in RNA post—transcriptional modifica—
tion, embryonic development and cellular growth and proliferation.
Similarly, genes in clusters C4 and C22 also exhibit similar expres—
sion pattern between humans and mice, with high expression levels
at the zygote and 2—cell stages. GO analysis of these genes indicates
significant over—representation of cell cycle and mitosis II. Together,
these results suggest that humans and mice share many core tran—
scriptional programming in their pre—implantation embryonic devel—
opment. In the contrary, there are also clusters of co—regulated genes
that show completely reverse expression patterns between the two
species. For example, co—regulated genes in clusters C1, C3, C8, C15
and C17 were expressed highly by mouse oocytes and/or prenuclear
embryos, but highly enriched in the human 8—cell and morula stages.
Also genes in clusters C7, C9 and C12 were high from 4—cell to mor—
ula in the mouse but low in corresponding stages in the human.
Interestingly, most genes with the reserved expression patterns are
involved in cell death and survival, cancer, metabolism and recom—
bination and repair. These results suggest that the mouse and human
early embryos employ very different pathways to prepare themselves
for the upcoming processes of implantation. In addition, comparing
patterns associated to clusters C13—14, C16 and C18—21 between
the two species shows variations in the timing of activation of genes
included, suggesting the potential mechanism of embryonic develop—
mental speed varies between humans and mice.

Collectively, our results here show that genes involved in many
fundamental biological networks during pre—implantation embry—
onic development are regulated in a conserved fashion between
humans and mice. There are both similarities and differences in the
activation timing of the co—regulated genes between the two species.
For example, genes engaged in networks such as mitosis II and pro—
liferation show the same activation timing; while genes involved in
biological processes such as cell death and survival show completely
reversed activation timing; and genes with roles in networks such as
mRNA metabolic process show delayed or advanced activation.
These cluster results bring unique insights to the little—known devel—
opmental programming of mammalian pre—implantation embryos.

6 Discussion

We have developed a new approach that can be used to identify co—
regulated gene clusters that are conserved among multiple species
using samples collected at a series of different time points such as
during pre—implantation embryonic development. The proposed ap—
proach consists of two components: pattern preserving noise reduc—
tion and multi—view bi—clustering via sparse rank—one matrix
factorization. We have developed an efficient algorithm that is guar—
anteed to converge for solving the optimization problem in the pro—
posed multi—view bi—clustering. Compared to the commonly used
two—step approach (Blakeley et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2014; Xue
et al., 2013), our approach is less vulnerable to noise in the gene
expression data and has the advantage of identifying conserved co—
regulated gene clusters among species. In this study, we did not
attempt to normalize data between species because in real world situ—
ations, direct comparisons in gene expression levels among species
may not be necessary. However, such normalization is intriguing and
new strategies should be developed when a need is presented.

We have succeeded in identifying conserved co—regulated gene
clusters between the human and mouse in their pre—implantation
embryos by applying the proposed approach. The clusters not only
represent functional gene networks that conserved in embryogenesis

between the two species, but reveal similarities and differences in
progression of developmental programming of embryos across spe—
cies. The identification of these orchestrated functional changes is
among the first step to unveil the little—known embryonic program—
ming, and provide directions of future research in embryogenesis.

Even though the development of the proposed method is moti—
vated by studying the pre—implantation embryonic development of
multiple mammalian species, it can certainly be applied to many
other similar situations. The approach that we have proposed for
cleaning the data can be employed to denoise other similar datasets
when gene expression patterns are the focus of the study. The pro—
posed multi—view bi—clustering method is a general clustering ap—
proach and can be used in any multi—view setting, especially in
situations where consistent gene clusters across views only exist in
the subspaces of the variables in the views.

Because expression patterns used here in noise reduction are es—
sentially variables that groups genes in the subsequent cluster ana—
lysis. The success of the method can be limited by the expression
patterns that are used. We suggest using all patterns that potentially
make biologic sense. The method is ﬂexible in that the patterns can
be modified when new biological questions arise. When combined
with the traditional two—step clustering approach, our method is a
great tool to obtain more information from the same dataset.

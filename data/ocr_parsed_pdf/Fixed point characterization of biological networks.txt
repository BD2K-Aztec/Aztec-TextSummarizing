ABSTRACT

Motivation: Feedback circuits are important motifs in biological
networks and part of virtually all regulation processes that are needed
for a reliable functioning of the cell. Mathematically, feedback is
connected to complex behavior of the systems, which is often related
to bifurcations of fixed points. Therefore, several approaches for
the investigation of fixed points in biological networks have been
developed in recent years. Many of them assume the fixed point
coordinates to be known, and an efficient way to calculate the
entire set of fixed points for interrelated feedback structures is highly
desirable.

Results: In this article, we consider regulatory network models,
which are differential equations with an underlying directed graph that
illustrates independencies among variables. We introduce the circuit-
breaking algorithm (CBA), a method that constructs one-dimensional
characteristics for these network models, which inherit important
information about the system. In particular, fixed points are related
to the zeros of these characteristics. The CBA operates on the graph
topology, and results from graph theory are used in order to make
calculations efficient. Our framework provides a general scheme for
analyzing network models in terms of interrelated feedback circuits.
The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a model for
calcium oscillations based on experiments in hepatocytes, which
consists of several interrelated feedback circuits.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ordinary differential equations are used in essentially all scientiﬁc
ﬁelds to describe dynamic behaviors of physical, biological or
technical systems. An analysis of these systems usually starts
with an investigation of their limit sets, in particular, the ﬁxed
points and their local phase portraits. In order to calculate the
ﬁxed points of a system 5r: f (x) with xeR", algorithms such as
Newton’s method and related approaches (Knoll and Keyes, 2004)
are commonly used. Besides the well-known problems of those
methods concerning convergence, they require the calculation of
the Jacobian matrix in each step, which can in most cases only be
done via numeric approximations. Consequently, these methods are
often computationally expensive, especially if n is large. It is thus

difﬁcult to investigate, for example, the dependence of ﬁxed point
coordinates on model parameters, which requires calculating the
ﬁxed points for multiple parameter values.

In many applications the differential equation system describes
the dynamics of interacting components, and a component is usually
not inﬂuenced by all other components, but by a subset of these.
These dependencies can be illustrated by a directed graph: if 5c,- is
inﬂuenced by xj, we indicate this with a directed edge from vertex
vj to vertex v,- in the graph, and the dynamics, in particular, the
ﬁxed point coordinates of xi, depend on xj. Thus, all ﬁxed point
coordinates of components in a Circuit are dependent, and the idea
of our approach is to exploit these dependencies in order to reduce
the dimension of the ﬁxed point equations f (3r)=0.

The concept of our approach will be explained in the context
of biological networks. More precisely, we consider intracellular
regulation processes with underlying directed graph structure, such
as gene regulatory networks (RNs). These systems are comm-
only based on Chemical reaction kinetics, resulting in nonlinear
models that cannot be solved analytically. Fixed points play an
essential role in those models, since the emergence of complex
behavior is often related to local biﬁircations of those points.
Bi- or multistability, which comes along with phenomena such
as switching behavior, decision processes or memory effects,
are generically caused by saddle-node bifurcations. Biological
examples for these phenomena are numerous: switching mecha-
nisms in multisite protein phosphorylation, which play a role in
eukaryotic signaling cascades (Angeli et al., 2004; Gunawardena,
2005), lysis or lysogenic pathway selection by phage A-infected
Escherichia coli cells (Arkin et al., 1998 and references therein)
cellular differentiation processes (Huang et (11., 2007) or epigenetic
differences caused by transient signals such as the state of the
lactose operon in Escherichia coli (Santillan and Mackey, 2008).
Oscillations are generically created by Hopf biﬁircations of ﬁxed
points (Chen and Aihara, 2002; Radde, 2009; Xiao and Cao, 2008)
and all those behaviors have been related to Circuits in the underlying
interaction graphs (I-graphs) (Novak and Tyson, 2008; Radde et al.,
2010; Wagner, 2005).

Besides a calculation of ﬁxed points for constructing bifurcation
diagrams, investigating the ﬁxed points of intracellular networks
is also facilitated by experimental data, since in many settings
only ﬁxed point measurements under different perturbations are
available, while kinetic data are missing (Steinke et (11., 2007). Along
these lines, analysis methods which operate on the ﬁxed points of
these networks have been developed in recent years. Examples are
robustness analysis with respect to kinetic perturbations, that is,

perturbations which leave the steady state ﬂuxes invariant (Waldherr
et al., 2009), or sensitivity analysis locally about ﬁxed points.
All these methods require a calculation of the ﬁxed points in advance.

In this article, we consider RN models, which are systems of
differential equations with underlying I-graphs. Vertices in these
graphs correspond to variables, and edges indicate any kind of
regulation. We introduce the Circuit-breaking algorithm (CBA),
which constructs one-dimensional Circuit Characteristics whose
zeros correspond to the ﬁxed point values of RNs. The principal
idea of our approach is to exploit the dependencies among ﬁxed point
coordinates of variables in a feedback Circuit and to describe the set
of ﬁxed points with a minimal set of independent variables. We show
that the cardinality of this set is related to the number of independent
elementary Circuits in the I-graph. Therefore, the Circuits in the graph
are broken, the ﬁxed points of the acyclic system are analyzed, and
Characteristics are constructed by iteratively Closing the Circuits. The
algorithm operates on the graph topology, and results from graph
theory are used to optimize efﬁciency, which is mainly determined
by the structure of interlinked Circuits. Thus, our approach provides
a connection between graph theory and dynamical systems theory
and is applicable in a very general setting. The article is organized in
the following manner: ﬁrst, we introduce the modeling framework
for RNs. Then the CBA for ﬁxed point calculation in those models
is explained. Finally, we show an application of the method to a RN
model for calcium oscillations based on experiments in hepatocytes
(Kummer et al., 2000).

2 MODELING FRAMEWORK

We consider differential equation models for RNs of the form
Xi(t)=fi(x(l)) i=1,---,n (1)

with state vector xeR" and continuously differentiable vector
ﬁeld f: U—> R" 6C1 deﬁned on an open subset UQR". The
corresponding initial value problem with initial state x(t=0)=x0
has a unique and smooth solution (p(t,x0) deﬁned on an interval
IX0 (Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1990). System (1) should have a
ﬁnite set of ﬁxed points with at least one element, which is required
later on to ensure termination of the algorithm. We consider this
assumption not as a strong restriction. It is fulﬁlled for nearly all
models based on Chemical reaction kinetics. Since the existence of
a compact and positively invariant set implies the existence of a
ﬁxed point inside, which is an extension of the Brouwer Fixed Point
Theorem (Basener et al., 2006), it is often sufﬁcient to show that
such a set exists.

We will work with the system’s underlying network structure.
More precisely, we consider the I-graph G(V,E) with vertex set
V={v1, ...,v,,} corresponding to the variables of the system and an
edge set E deﬁned in the following way:

eiiEE <=> EleUsuChthatS—ﬁ>0 (2)

xi
e-~eEi7é'<=>Eler hthta—fi 0 3
l] 7 J 5110 3- axj?’é 

The I-graph is a digraph that might contain loops in case of positive
auto-regulations. This deﬁnition of a RN model is very general and
includes as a special case models in which the partial derivatives
Bfi/axj, i 751', have constant signs independent of the system’s state

or, equivalently, the off-diagonal elements in the J acobian matrix of
the system have constant sign structure. This is a well-investigated
model Class (Angeli et al., 2010; Gouze, 1998; Letellier and Vallee,
2003; Radde et al., 2010; Thomas, 1981) with I-graphs that have
sign-labeled edges. Signs of (semi)paths or (semi)circuits are deﬁned
within this Class as the product of signs of edges belonging to
the paths or Circuits, respectively. They have been proven useful
for the analysis of these models in many respects. However, since
this monotonicity constraint is not always fulﬁlled in biological
examples, we do not want to be too restrictive at this point and allow
for sign Changes and zeros of the partial derivatives as well. Thus,
some edges in the I-graph might have sign-labels, others do not.
This relaxation is a crucial extension to previous work, since many
graph-theoretical considerations strongly rely on these monotonicity
constraints (Angeli et al., 2010; Gouze, 1998). To conclude, a RN
is deﬁned here as a tuple (D, G) of a dynamical system D and an
underlying digraph G(V,E), called the I-graph, which is completely
determined by D. Edges of G might be labeled if the respective
partial derivative has a constant sign independent of the system’s
state.

3 THE CBA
3.1 Idea

The idea of our approach is that ﬁxed points of a circuit are completely
characterized by knowing the ﬁxed point coordinate of just one of the
variables in the circuit. To illustrate the point, we consider the following
single circuit system with n vertices:

561(1) =f1(X1(l)~Xn(l)) (4)
5W) =fi(xi(t)vxi—l(t)) i=2~---Jl- (5)

The procedure is shown in Figure 1 for three vertices. According to our
deﬁnition of RNs, the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix are non-
positive here (otherwise the system had loops). In order to calculate the ﬁxed
points of the system, in a ﬁrst step we break the circuit by cutting the edge
from vertex v” to vertex v1 and ﬁxing variable X] to a value [(1. The ﬁxed
point coordinates of this directed acyclic graph (DAG) can now be calculated
as functions of [(1. Here, the set 320(1) is implicitly given by

f2()_€2~X1=K1)=0~ (6)

and we proceed iteratively for the remaining vertices, such that )_C,(K1) is
characterized by

fiU‘ivxi—lZii—l(ii—2(...(K1))))=O i=3,...,n. (7)

Fig. 1. Idea of the CBA illustrated with a single circuit: the circuit is broken
by ﬁxing variable X] = K], and the set of ﬁxed point coordinates of the acyclic
system is iteratively calculated as a function of [(1. Then the circuit is closed
by constructing the circuit characteristic c(K1), whose zeros are the ﬁxed
point coordinates fr 1. Finally, the set It] is used as input to calculate the set 3c
of ﬁxed points of the system.

We keep in mind that this iterative calculation scheme for ﬁxed point
coordinates in dependence of the values of the parent vertices can be applied
to any RNs with acyclic I-graphs. The circuit is closed by solving the equation

f1(m.xt=xn(m>é0. (8)

leading to a set of solutions x1, which are the ﬁxed point values of x1.
Subsequently, we will refer to f1(K1 ,xn(K1)) as circuit-characteristic c(K1)
associated with variable x1 and to solving Equation (8) as circuit-closing
step, which is the important step in our algorithm. Solutions generally have
to be calculated numerically. The input of the function fl is the value [(1 and
the set MK] ), which also might have to be calculated numerically. Since the
sets xi(K1), i=2, . . .,n, are uniquely determined by K], we can also skip this
second input in Equation (8), bearing in mind that c(K1) does not necessarily
describe a function of K]. The set Mm) are the ﬁxed point branches of a
bifurcation diagram with K] as bifurcation parameter and might be empty or
contain several elements depending on the value of [(1. Having determined
the set It; , all other ﬁxed point coordinates can again iteratively be calculated
by inserting elements of this set into Equations (6) and (7), in the same order
as before. Thus, the zeros of c(K1) completely characterize the ﬁxed points
of the system.

A similar scheme for a single negative circuit oscillator model and
analytically calculable set x” was used in Pigolotti et al. (2007), which
was not explicitly stated there. Note that we could as well have started by
ﬁxing another variable in the circuit, which would have led to a different
characteristic, but we will see that some properties are completely determined
by the graph topology and are independent of the chosen associated variable.

The idea of constructing a one-dimensional characteristic whose zeros
correspond to the ﬁxed points of an RN model by breaking the circuits in the
I-graph can be generalized for RNs with arbitrary I-graph topology. In the
following, we will set up the scheme for constructing such a characteristic
given the I-graph G(V,E), and we call this procedure the CBA. The main
difference when going to more complex graph topologies is that the circuit
characteristic cannot always be constructed in a single circuit-closing step.
Generally, we have to do the procedure several times, depending on the
I-graph topology. We will often make use of graph-theoretical algorithms
for efﬁcient calculations.

3.2 Generalization to strongly connected graphs

Given an RN (D,G) with strongly connected I-graph G(V,E), the CBA
proceeds as follows to construct a circuit characteristic and to calculate the
set of ﬁxed points of the system.

3.2.] Find set C of elementary circuits We start by listing the elementary
circuits in G(V,E) in a set C of subsets of vertices. Elementary circuits are
circuits in which each vertex is encountered only once while moving along
the circuit. Several algorithms have been proposed for ﬁnding this set C
(Szwarcﬁter and Lauer, 1976; Tarjan, 1972, 1973; Tiernan, 1970), which
can be done in O(|V|+ |E|(|C| +l)) time, where |V|, |E| and |C| denote the
number of vertices, edges and elementary circuits in G, respectively.

3.2.2 Determine minimal circuit-covering vertex set I7 Second, we
determine a minimal circuit-covering vertex set I7 for C , that is, a minimal
subset I7 of V such that each element in C contains at least one vertex in 
We denote the number of elements in I7 by M. M is crucial for the efﬁciency
of the algorithm, since it determines the minimal number of circuit-closing
steps needed for the calculation of the ﬁxed point set x of the system. Let
the elements in I7 be I7 = {vml , . . . , va }. The rest of the vertices is collected
in the set V: V\\~/= {v1l ,...,v[L} with L+M= |V|. Both sets are changed
during the CBA: in each circuit-closing step, one element in I7 is shifted to
V, and ﬁnally I720 and V: V.

PROPOSITION 1. Finding a minimal circuit-covering vertex set I7§V in
a digraph G(V,E) is an non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard
optimization problem.

 

Fig. 2. Instances of the NP-hard VC problem on undirected graphs can be
reformulated to ﬁnding a minimal circuit-covering vertex set I7 in a digraph
by replacing each undirected edge with two edges ofopposite direction. Here,
the white vertices represent a VC in the undirected graph (left panel) and a
minimal circuit-covering vertex set in the respective digraph (right panel).

PROOF. Instances of the vertex cover (VC) problem can be translated into
ﬁnding a minimal circuit-covering vertex set  A VC of an undirected graph
is a minimal subset V* E V of vertices such that each edge in the graph is
incident to at least one vertex in V*. Finding such a set V* is an NP-hard
optimization problem (Korte and Vygen, 2008). It is easy to verify that the
problem of ﬁnding a VC in an undirected graph corresponds to ﬁnding a
minimal circuit-covering vertex set I7 in the corresponding digraph, which
is constructed by replacing all edges in the undirected graph by two edges
of opposite direction. This is illustrated in Figure 2 by a graph with four
vertices that has VC-number 2. The vertices marked in white are a VC in
the undirected graph (Fig. 2, left panel), and at the same time also a minimal
circuit-covering vertex set I7 in the respective digraph (Fig. 2, right panel).
Note that if the I-graph had loops, the corresponding vertices can be included
into the set I7 apriori, since they have to be contained in each minimal circuit-
covering vertex set in any case, and the problem of ﬁnding I7 can be reduced
by operating on the subgraph induced by the rest of the vertices. I

3.2.3 Calculate the circuit-characteristic c(KM) In the next step, we use
the set I7 to determine a circuit-characteristic c(KM) associated with variable
me , which is afterwards used to calculate the ﬁxed points x of the RN model.
To this end, all circuits in G are broken by ﬁxing the vertices in  i.e. setting
xmf 2: Kj, j = l, . . . ,M. For convenience, we summarize all Kj in a single vector
K ERM . This vector K serves as input for the circuit-free system, and, since
the acyclic I-graph has a topological order, the ﬁxed point coordinates of the
remaining vertices {v1l ,...,v[L} e I7 can iteratively be calculated as functions
of the input K. This translates to solving L equations

ﬁszleVleR,ﬁp(xlp,K)=0 p:l,...,L (9)

for 2,”. The solutions of these L equations are collected in a set x‘7(K). In the
next step, the circuits are closed one after another by releasing vertices in I7:
for all j = l, . . . ,M. we calculate the zeros of the partial circuit-characteristics
pj(Kj , K), which is done by ﬁrst reducing the set I7 by vertex v,,,]. and the vector
K by component Kj and then solving the implicit equation

N _ !
fmf :R X Rm —> R,f,,,f(xmf =Kj,x\7(K,Kj),K)=O (10)

for x,,,]. to obtain a set 2",, (K) of ﬁxed point coordinates for variable x,,,].
in dependence of the values K of vertices in the set  Thereby circuits
containing x,,,]. are closed. Similar to Equation (8), for ﬁxed K, the set x‘7(K, Kj)
describes ﬁxed point branches of a bifurcation diagram with bifurcation
parameter Kj. Having determined the solution set x,,,f(K), vertex v,,,]. is shifted
to  The cardinality of the set  which determines the dimension of the

closing step, such that we ﬁnally end up with a one-dimensional circuit

3.2.4 Calculate set of ﬁxed points x of the system The set of zeros of c(KM)

are the ﬁxed point values me of vertex va . These can iteratively be inserted
backwards into the partial circuit characteristics pj, j =M — l, . . ., l in order

to obtain the ﬁxed point coordinates of the other variables in the original
set  Respective ﬁxed point coordinates of the vertices that have originally
been in V can be calculated as well by inserting those values into x‘7(K), such
that we have reconstructed the set x of zeros from the characteristic c(KM).

The I-graph and signs of circuits contain information about the circuit-
characteristic independent of the associated variable.

PROPOSITION 2. If only negative circuits of a strongly connected graph G are
closed by releasing vertex v,,,]. , the corresponding partial circuit characteristic
pj(Kj,K) is strictly decreasing with respect to Kj.

PROOF. We consider the derivative of the partial circuit characteristic

with respect to Kj for arbitrary K: K*:

p,vlpeV

The last term is non-positive from the deﬁnition of the I-graph, which would
have a positive loop otherwise, contrary to the assumption. Moreover, all
terms in the sum are negative: The partial derivative is positive if the
respective regulator vlp is an activator of the released vertex v,,,]., but in this
case the path from v,,,]. to v1,7 must be negative for the circuit to be negative,
which translates into a negative derivative d2,” /dK]-. Contrary, if vlp is an
inhibitor of v,,,]. , the partial derivative is negative, but then the path from v,,,].
to vlp must be positive, such that the product is again negative. Consequently,
all terms in the derivative are negative. I

It follows immediately that systems lacking positive circuits have at most
one isolated ﬁxed point, which was also proven in a different way by Gouzé
(1998) and Snoussi (1998).

3.3 Generalization to arbitrary graph topologies

The CBA can be extended to RNs (D,G) with I-graph G(V,E) that is not
strongly connected. Without loss of generality, we still assume connectedness
of the graph. We have to consider the ﬁxed point coordinates separately for
each strongly connected component (SCC). In order to construct the set x
from the individual ﬁxed point sets of each component, we introduce the
concept ofﬁxed point paths.

3.3.] Find SCCs In the ﬁrst step, we partition the vertex set V into subsets
V: {V1 , . . . , VK } such that the subgraphs Gk induced by Vk are the SCC of
G. This can be done in O(| V| + |E |) time by a depth ﬁrst search algorithm as
originally described by Tarjan (1972) (for a more recent improved algorithm
see also Korte and Vygen, 2008). Contracting the vertices of SCCs yields a
DAG, which has a topological order. Therefore, the ﬁxed point coordinates
can be calculated iteratively for each SCC, starting with the component on top
of the hierarchy. When doing so, the ﬁxed points V of a component k serve
as constant inputs for calculating the ﬁxed point coordinates of subsequent
components. We assume that the subgraphs Gk are already hierarchically
ordered, with G1 being on top. Then we proceed by iteratively calculating
the ﬁxed point coordinates of each subgraph in the way explained before.
This has to be done for each possible input, that is, for each ﬁxed point set
3:1, z = l, . . . ,k—l of the previous SCCs.

3.3.2 Determine ﬁxed point paths Having calculated V for all k, these
deﬁne the ﬁxed point set x of the system. The following example illustrates
how to achieve the set x of ﬁxed points of the system from the sets 5%:

ﬁxed point coordinates of the SCCs. Fixed point paths are the paths in this
graph which do not end with an empty set. Here the only path is (1,1,0),
and the system has one ﬁxed point x: (l, 1,0).

4 APPLICATION OF THE CBA TO A MODEL FOR
CALCIUM OSCILLATIONS

We illustrate the CBA on a network model for cytoplasmic calcium
oscillations based on experiments in hepatocytes, which is described
in Kummer et al. (2000):

561 = k1+k2x1—k3x2m(x1761)—k4x3m(x1762)

562 = ksxi —k6m(x2793)

563 = k7x2X3m(X4.94)+k8X2+k9X1—
k10m(x3795)-k11m(x3796)

564 = -k7x2x3m(x4.94)+k11m(x3796) (15)

with x=(Ga*,PLC*,CaCy;,Caer) denoting concentrations of an
active G-protein-linked receptor, active phospholipase C enzyme,
free calcium in the cytoplasm and calcium in the endoplasmic
reticulum, respectively. The ﬁinctions m(x,6)=x/(x+6) are
Michaelis—Menten terms, and all rate constants k and Michaelis
constants 6 are non-negative. The model can show periodic
oscillations and bursting. We are interested in the ﬁxed points of
the system in the positive orthant for parameter values given by
k1=0.09,k2 = 2, k3 = l.27,k4 = 3.73,k5 = 1.27, k6 = 32.24,k7 =
2,k3 =0.05,k9 =13.58,k10 =153,k11=4.85,61=0.19,62 =

0.73, 63 = 2909,64 =2.67, 65 :0. 16,66 =0.05 (Peifer and Timmer,
2007). Since the positive orthant R1 is invariant for the ﬂow,
as can easily be seen by showing xi(xi=0)30 for i=l,...,4,
we set U =Ri. The vector ﬁeld is continuously differentiable in
this region. We note that U is not a trapping region for all initial

Fig. 5. The CBA applied to the calcium oscillation network described in Kummer et al. (2000). A minimal circuit-covering vertex set is given by V = {1,3}.
In the ﬁrst step the circuits are broken by ﬁxing all variables in V, and the set of ﬁxed point coordinates x; and x4 are calculated as functions of the input

K=(K1,K2). Then the circuits are iteratively closed, here by ﬁrst releasing variable x1. Mathematically, this translates into calculating the zeros 210(2) of the
partial circuit characteristic p1(K1,K2). The ﬁnal circuit characteristic, which is constructed by releasing vertex v3, is a function of K2, and its zeros determine

the set of ﬁxed point coordinates 5:3. The ﬁxed point coordinates of the other variables can be calculated by inserting elements of 173 into 21m), leading to the

set x1, and then into 226“) and £451,123).

conditions x0 ER", a property that can also be recognized by our
Characteristics.

The I-graph of this system (Fig. 5) is strongly connected,
i.e. K: 1, and we skip the index k here. All edges except e43
are sign labeled, which is indicated by arrows (activation) and
blunt ends (inhibition). The Circuit set consists of seven elements
including three positive, three negative and one unsigned Circuit, C =
{{1,2,3,4},{1},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{3,4},{1,2,3}}. Since G contains
positive and negative Circuits, only from the topology neither
multiple ﬁxed points nor periodic behavior can be excluded a priori.
A minimal Circuit-covering vertex set is V={1,3}, and we identify
M=2, m1=1 and mM=3. Vertices in the set V are marked in
white in Figure 5. First, we break the circuits by setting x1=2K1
and x3 :2 K2, and calculate the ﬁxed point values of variables in the

The ﬁrst set of circuits is Closed by releasing vertex v1. We note
that the subgraph induced by v1 and v2 has the structure of an
activator-inhibitor oscillator model (Tyson, 2005) with input K2,
a typical structure which is capable of producing oscillations and
bistability (Chen and Aihara, 2002; Radde, 2009; Tyson, 2005).
Mathematically, we reduce V by v1 and K by K1, such that V: {V3}
and K={K2}, and calculate the zeros £109) of the partial Circuit
Characteristic

Having solved this equation, v1 is shifted to  The Characteristic p1
is shown in Figure 6, along with the contour pl :0, which deﬁnes
the solution set x109) that is used as input for the ﬁnal Circuit
characteristic.

The sets x1(K2),x2(K2) and x4(K2) are shown in Figure 7 (left
panel, 1—3 ﬁgures from top). These graphs are bifurcation diagrams
with K2 as a bifurcation parameter. The graph x109) shows that
the subsystem consisting of the vertices v1 and v2 has a bistable
range due to the positive auto-regulation of v1 for K2 6 [0.18, 0.42],
with a lower stable ﬁxed point x1 80 (red line) and an upper one
between 4 and 8 (blue line). These are separated by an unstable
ﬁxed point branch (green line). Since x1 activates x2, x209) has
qualitatively the same course. The graph x4(K2) shows several
peculiarities of the x4-dynamics: given K2, x4 is produced with
a constant synthesis rate s=k11m(K2,66) and is degraded with a
rate y=k7x2(K2)K2m(x4,64) that has an upper bound k7x2(K2)K2
independent of x4. The bifurcation diagram x4(K2) has poles at s = y
(here two), and takes positive values only between these, which
correspond to the upper stable ﬁxed point branches of x1 and x2
(blue lines). This restricts ﬁrst of all the range of possible values
x3 to the range of values where positive solutions x4 > 0 exist, and
second, it also shows that the positive auto-regulation of x1 does not
lead to two distinct stable steady states in the positive orthant for
the complete system, since there are no positive solutions x4 for the
lower stable ﬁxed point branch in.

For constructing the ﬁnal Circuit Characteristic c(K2) associated
with variable x3, we release vertex V3, leading to

C(Kz)1=f3()?2(361(K2)).K234(K232(31(K2)))731(K2))=0 (18)
with
k11m(K2796)94
k7)?ch (K2))K2 - k1 1 11100766)-

The Characteristic c(K2) is shown in Figure 7 (bottom left panel).
Most importantly, it has one zero at x3 =0.215, and consequently
the system has one ﬁxed point, x=(6.43,9.9,0.215,34)1, which is
calculated by inserting [(2:33 into )_CZ(K2), i= 1,2,4. Graphically,
this translates into simply reading off the respective values in the
graphs Eel-(K2) in Figure 7, indicated by the blue dashed line here.

Moreover, the Characteristic indicates that the system might have
the potential to show bistability for certain parameter values, since
by shifting the curve to the positive y-direction, it eventually
has three ﬁxed points. We veriﬁed this by introducing a basic
synthesis rate s3=95 for x3, which causes the desired shift of
the characteristic. The value was read from the graph c(K2).

5 CONCLUSION

This article considers RN models, which are described as systems
of ordinary differential equations with an underlying directed
graph structure, the I-graph. We have introduced the CBA for the
Characterization of ﬁxed points of these models. The CBA exploits
the dependencies of the ﬁxed point coordinates in a connected graph
in order to ﬁnd a minimal characterization. Based on this idea,
we constructed a one-dimensional Circuit Characteristic by breaking
all circuits in the graph and iteratively Closing them again. These
circuit-Closing steps correspond to solving implicit equations, whose
dimensions are related to the Circuit-structure of the graph. We
demonstrated that this dimension is bounded from below by the
cardinality of a minimal subset of vertices that covers the elementary
circuits and explained how to construct the ﬁxed point set of the
system from the zeros of this Circuit characteristic. Our approach
has several advantages over purely numerical methods: ﬁrst, in
comparison to solving an n-dimensional equation f (x)=0,xeR",
the dimension of the equations in the CBA can be much smaller,
especially for sparse graphs. Second, we have demonstrated on a
biological network model of interlocked feedback circuits that the
inﬂuence of parameter variations on the ﬁxed points can also be
investigated by our algorithm. Thus, the constructed Characteristics
are, for example, useﬁIl to ﬁnd bifurcations and parameter regions
in which the system has a certain number of ﬁxed points.

In this article, we applied the CBA to a network of four
components. It can also be used to investigate ﬁxed points of larger
networks. The efﬁciency and superiority to Newton-type methods
depend on the graph topology and increase when the cardinality of
the minimal Circuit-covering vertex sets decrease. We expect this to
correlate with the sparsity of the graph, but it is not yet clear how we
can further Characterize the topology and behavior of such graphs.
For larger networks, we expect that the computation of the SCCs,
their Circuit sets and especially the minimal Circuit-covering vertex
sets, is not negligible any more and increases the running time. We
believe that our approach can especially facilitate the analysis of
ﬁxed point sets of smaller network models, and their dependence
on parameter values. If the network consists of several interrelated
feedback structures, it is in practice applicable to models of only
few (say <10) components.

Finally, our approach is based on a very general framework and
can be applied to a large class of differential equations. Complex
dynamic behavior is related to circuits in the I-graphs, and the
CBA provides an analysis method in terms of subnetworks with
interrelated Circuit structure. While in the past methodology has been
developed for single feedback Circuits, only few approaches exist
that can handle complex feedback, and our method is a contribution
in this direction. Recent studies indicate that complex network
structures are often related to ﬁinctional robustness, and methods
to analyze these networks are thus highly relevant also from a
biological point of view.

Several interesting question will guide our ﬁIture work, most
importantly, we believe that the Circuit Characteristics contain
information about asymptotic properties of the system such as
stability of the ﬁxed points.

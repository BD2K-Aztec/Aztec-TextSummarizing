ABSTRACT

Motivation: In a microarray time series analysis, due to the large
number of genes evaluated, the first step toward understanding the
complex time network is the clustering of genes that share similar
expression patterns over time. Up until now, the proposed methods
do not point simultaneously to the temporal autocorrelation of the
gene expression and the model-based clustering. We present a
Bayesian method that considers jointly the fit of autoregressive panel
data models and hierarchical gene clustering.

Results: The proposed methodology was able to cluster genes that
share similar expression over time, which was determined jointly by
the estimates of autoregression parameters, by the average level of
expression) and by the quality of the fitted model.

Availability and implementation: The R codes for implementation
of the proposed clustering method and for simulation study, as well
as the real and simulated datasets, are freely accessible on the Web

1 INTRODUCTION

Microarray time series (MTS) analysis allows the researcher to
Characterize set of genes through their longitudinal pattern of
expression. According to Schiliep et al. (2003), the MTS data
analysis methodologies can be divided into two Classes. The ﬁrst
one assumes the observations on the expression at each time as
independent variables, and so the usual methods such as hierarchical
process (Eisen et (11., 1998) and the optimization (Tavazoie et (11.,
1999) can be directly used to Cluster genes with similar expression
pattern. The second performs Clustering based on the set of
parameters estimates from speciﬁc models, therefore, it is considered
more interesting from the statistical and biological viewpoint, since
the temporal expression behavior can be taken into account in the
Clustering.

Among the second Class of methods, the dynamic (Ramoni et (11.,
2002), the hidden Markov (Schiliep et (11., 2003) and the B-splines
(Bar-Joseph et (11., 2003) models deserve special attention. Although
these methods are useful, they are not suitable for relatively small

experiments, with less than 10 temporal observations per gene (Bar-
Joseph, 2004). However, according to Ernst et al. (2005), MTS
studies are generally Characterized by a large number of genes
evaluated but with a small number of the temporal expression
measures per gene.

In the ﬁeld of time series, mainly in econometrics, the Bayesian
autoregressive panel data model is recommended for situations with
large number of small series (Liu and Tiao, 1980), since it provides
an increase in accuracy relatively to autoregressive model ﬁt to each
one small series.

Considering these advantages of model-based Clustering methods
and the difﬁculty of applying them to a large number of small series,
here we propose a Bayesian method that considers simultaneously an
autoregressive panel data model ﬁt and a hierarchical Clustering of
the parameter estimates from this model. In addition, we present
the detailed R (R Development Core Team, 2011) codes with
comments about the proposed method and its application to a
MTS dataset extracted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Stanford
MicroArray Database.

2 METHODS

The autoregressive panel data model of order [7. AR ([7). according to Liu
and Tiao (1980). is given by as follows:

According to the Bayes theorem. the posterior distribution for the

Under this approach. the Gibbs sampler algorithm was implemented in
R software (R Development Core Team. 2011) using the following full
conditional posterior distributions:

(1)3: (XTX+ I)_1(XTY+Ip.). E =XTX+I and I is an identity matrix.

2.1 Iterative method for clustering genes with similar
gene expression patterns

The gene clustering was performed using iterative process in which initially
a single panel (only one cluster with all genes) from which the parameter
estimates from Model 1 were obtained. These estimates were used as input
variables in a Ward clustering analysis (Ward. 1963). then for each resulting
cluster. the Model 1 was ﬁtted again. This procedure results in a new set of
parameter estimates in each Gibbs sampler iteration and consequently in a
new clustering output. The number of clusters in each Ward clustering was
deﬁned by Mojena’s (1977) criterion; therefore. this number can change in
each iteration.

Thus. once guaranteed the Gibbs sampler chains convergence. the
convergence to the globally optimal solution (the optimal clustering of which
the input data should be belonged to) is also guaranteed. Nevertheless.
the Gibbs sampler involves drawing random numbers from full conditional
posterior distributions. and due to this. the algorithm was run considering
three different sets of start values in order to verify if the clustering results
were always the same after the convergence.

Figure 1 shows a scheme of the proposed method for genes whose
expression series were modeled by an AR(2) panel data model. the simplest
multi parametric model. Under this framework. our main goal is that at the
end of the algorithm. the resulting clusters contain series with similar gene
expression patterns over time. according to the parameter estimates of the
given model.

2.2 Implementation

We implemented our program using R statistical computing environment
with the computation conducted with a Intel Core 2 Duo E7500 2.0GHz
with 4GB of RAM.

2.3 Application to simulated data

We evaluated the proposed clustering method performance using 10
simulated datasets. each one with 117 genes divided into ﬁve clusters.
The genes expression levels were generated over 10 time points using the
model described in equation (1). The function arima.sim of R software

Fig. 1. Flowchart summarizing the Bayesian model-based clustering using

(R Development Core Team. 2011) was used to simulate the gene expression
time series for each gene into each cluster as follows:

Yik = Mk +¢i1 Yi(k—1) +¢itYi(k—2) +617.
where Yik is the time series (a vector with dimension 1 X 10) of gene 1' (i = 1.
 1;.) of cluster k (k=1.  5). uk is the intercept (average of gene
expression). the term or indicates a autoregressive process (Model 1) with
parameters $1 and $2 (AR(2) process) and (782 is the residual variance.

The numbers of genes and longitudinal points were chosen taking into
account the dimension of the real dataset presented in the next item. and
the number of clusters (ﬁve) and the values of Mk. ¢1k. ¢2k and of: were
determined in according to the results from the real data analysis that will be
presented later. For example. the values assumed for ¢1k in the simulation
were the average values of the estimates obtained from each resulting cluster
k. i.e. ¢1k =Zf":l¢3.1k/Ik. where ﬁnk is the estimate of $1 for each gene
belonging to cluster k and I;C is the number of genes in the cluster k. The
values of Mk. ¢2k and of: were obtained in same way as ¢1k.

In order to compare the clustering method present here with a traditional
clustering method. the 10 simulated datasets were also analyzed using k-
means algorithm. in which the input variables were the observed gene
expression level in each time. Under this approach. given a set of time
series gene expression observations: Y1=[y1. yz..... ym].  . Y117=[y1.
yz.  ym]. the k-means algorithm aims to partition the 117 genes into K
(K 5 117) sets S 2 [S1, SQ,  SK] so as to minimize the within-cluster sum

in Si. The choice of k-means is due to its general use in gene expression
clustering (Mar 21 al.. 2011; Oh et al.. 2011). but it is important emphasize
that the success of this method depends of the stated number of clusters.
which was the same number used in the simulation study (ﬁve). i.e. was
considered the optimum condition for the application of this method.

The comparison between Bayesian model-based clustering using
autoregressive panel data approach and k-means was evaluated by correct

classiﬁcation rate (CCR). which was computed as the ratio between the
numbers of genes clustered into the true cluster (from simulation) and the
total number of genes.

2.4 Application to real data

We applied the proposed method to expressions of 117 genes that act on cell
cycle of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Zhu et al.. 2000). We used 10 points
of the non-synchronized cells data. whose fold-change values came from the
expression of mutant strains (treated) compared with wild strains (control).
at each evaluated time (0. 15. 30.. . .. 135 min). At ﬁrst. the choice by non-
synchronized data was a manner to show that the proposed methodology
works well for not only for highly selected datasets but also for general
class of microarray datasets. For example. if a cell culture is separated out
by time. and the expression of genes is measured as a function of time.
one can get an idea of which genes vary in expression over time using
regression models (Bar-Joseph et al.. 2003; Ramoni et al.. 2002) with time
as a covariate. However. considering that non-synchronized cell populations
contain cells at various points in the cell cycle. under this common regression
approach. the time effect can be confounded with cell cycle. By the other
hand. in the autoregressive regression Model 1. the covariate is not time
itself but instead is the expression levels measured at the previous time. thus
avoiding the confounding between cell cycle and time. The used dataset may
be downloaded at: http://smd.stanford.edu/.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulated data

Performance of the Clustering methods based on the simulated data
is presented in Figure 2, in which the proposed CCR in Section 2.3
was used for evaluation over 10 replicated datasets.

Comparison of the approaches does show that k-means Clustering
performs poorly in relation to Bayesian model-based, once the CCR
values were Clearly lower. On average, these values were 47.5%
(12.56)and 67.42% (9.44), respectively, for k-means and Bayesian
model-based methods.

Although the simulated dataset was generated under Model 1
assumptions, the comparison between the proposed model-based
Clustering (using parameter estimates as input variables) and the
traditional k-means (using observed gene expression level in each
time as input variables) methods makes sense. It is because there are
biological justiﬁcations to dependence between a gene expression
at time t and previous time. thus whether this dependence is

disregarded in the Clustering process (as occurred with k-means
application) really the results will not be satisfactory.

We would like to make Clear that the simulation study compared
the Clustering effectiveness of a new method, which take into
account the temporal dependence of gene expression values using
Ward algorithm and a traditional method, k-means, that considers
the independence between these values. Maybe a more honest
comparison would be realized between k-means and Ward using
this same Bayesian model-base approach, but it can be a topic for
future research, once the use of k-means rather than Ward requires
an iterative process (k-means optimization) into each Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) iteration.

3.2 Real data

The algorithm had a running time of 2446” considering Gibbs
sampler Chains with 10000 iterations. The Chains convergence
was accessed by Geweke and Raftery—Lewis diagnostics using
boa package (Smith. 2007) of R software (R Development Core
Team, 2011). These results indicated that the iteration number was
enough to ensure the convergence, and ﬁirthermore, it was found
that the number of Clusters (k) and individuals belonging to them
stabilized from around 1000 iterations. In addition, it is relevant to
highlight that the three different sets of start values provided the
same Clustering output.

Results allowed genes to be partitioned into ﬁve distinct Clusters,
with 23. 32. 15. 24 and 23 genes in each one. In general, it can be
observed that the ﬁve Clusters have very distinct expression patterns.
Among the various differences, it can be noted that the genes that
make up Clusters 1 and 2 (Fig. 3) have opposite average behavior
during the cell cycle, with observed fold-Change values, respectively,
for Clusters 1 and 2, negative and positive until a given time. and

then, after those times the signals are inverted (Fig. 3B and D).
Furthermore, genes belonging to Cluster 5 (Fig. 4) generally showed
more expression in the control (wild strains) during the cell cycle of
Saccharomyces.

Figures 3A, C, E and 4A and C depict the gene expression time
series in each resulting cluster. The differences in the number of
genes that made up each cluster may be related to the number
of functions associated with the genes, i.e. clusters with a greater
number of genes could be associated with a greater number of
ﬁinctions during the cell cycle.

In summary, we can verify that the proposed methodology was
able to cluster genes that share similar expression pattern over time.
This similarity can be explained jointly by the magnitude of the
dependence between expression at time t and the expressions at
time 11 and i2 (estimates of autoregression parameters, (1). and (ﬁg),
by the average level of expression ([1) and by the quality of the ﬁtted
model (03), once these values were considered as input variables
in the clustering rather than the observed gene expression values
over time.

4 CONCLUDING REMARKS

In both simulated and real datasets, the proposed Bayesian model-
based clustering method performed very well, once allowed to
cluster genes that share similar expression pattern over time.
This method was based on the autoregressive panel data model,

which is widely used in the econometrics ﬁeld. Thus, one of
the main contributions of this study is to arouse interest of
bioinformatician for models from this ﬁeld in order to describe
the time dependence of gene expressions. For example, other
powerﬁil models like autoregressive integrated moving average
and autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity can also be
considered. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing data from
time series RNA-seq assays can also be analyzed under this
approach. However, because to the counting nature of these data
(number of reads in a class), other distributions, such as Poisson and
Negative Binomial, must be adopted in the likelihood ﬁinction. With
respect to inference methods, the maximum likelihood (Ideker et al.,
2000) can be used rather than Bayesian method using generalizations
of the Expectation- Maximization (EM) algorithm.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: DNA methylation plays critical roles in gene regulation and
cellular specification without altering DNA sequences. The wide appli-
cation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and
whole genome bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) opens the door to
study DNA methylation at single CpG site resolution. One challenging
question is how best to test for significant methylation differences
between groups of biological samples in order to minimize false posi-
tive findings.

Results: We present a statistical analysis package, methylSig, to ana-
lyse genome-wide methylation differences between samples from dif-
ferent treatments or disease groups. MethylSig takes into account
both read coverage and biological variation by utilizing a beta-binomial
approach across biological samples for a CpG site or region, and
identifies relevant differences in CpG methylation. It can also incorp-
orate local information to improve group methylation level and/or vari-
ance estimation for experiments with small sample size. A permutation
study based on data from enhanced RRBS samples shows that
methylSig maintains a well-calibrated type-l error when the number
of samples is three or more per group. Our simulations show that
methylSig has higher sensitivity compared with several alternative
methods. The use of methylSig is illustrated with a comparison of
different subtypes of acute leukemia and normal bone marrow
samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine) is the most intensively
studied and one of the best understood epigenetic marks in
mammalian cells, having important roles in imprinting, genome
stability and regulation of gene expression without altering the
DNA sequence itself (Kulis and Esteller, 2010; Yang et al., 2010).
In mammalian cells, cytosine methylation occurs almost exclu-
sively at CpG dinucleotides, with the exception of embryonic
stem cells, where non-CpG methylation is a frequent occurrence

(Lister et al., 2009). DNA methylation is essential for normal
development and cell differentiation due to its roles in regulating
gene expression. For example, unmethylated Cst in promoter
regions can allow binding of speciﬁc transcription factors (TFs)
while methylated Cst in these regions can prevent binding
(Lim and Maher, 2010). Furthermore, extensive crosstalk
occurs between DNA methylation and chromatin modifying his-
tone marks (Izzo and Schneider, 2010; Kassner et al., 2013; Shen
and Laird, 2013; Vaissiere et al., 2008). Dysregulation of DNA
methylation is a hallmark of cancer, with overall genomic
demethylation and gene-speciﬁc hypermethylation, most notably
in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (Sharma et al., 2010).

Treatment of DNA with sodium bisulﬁte deaminates
unmethylated cytosines to uracil while methylated cytosines are
resistant to this conversion, thus allowing for sequence-speciﬁc
discrimination between methylated and unmethylated CpG sites
(Clark et al., 2006). Sodium bisulﬁte pre-treatment of DNA
coupled with next-generation sequencing has facilitated
genome-wide quantitative DNA methylation to be studied at
single cytosine site resolution (Gu et al., 2010; Laird, 2010;
Lister and Ecker, 2009). The high cost of whole-genome bisulﬁte
sequencing (bis-seq), and the uneven distribution of CpG sites in
the genome motivated the development of modiﬁed approaches
such as reduced representation bis-seq (RRBS) (Gu et al., 2011;
Jeddeloh et al., 2008; Meissner et al., 2005) and enhanced RRBS
(ERRBS) (Akalin et al., 2012a). These methods have the advan-
tage of requiring fewer sequencing reads by enriching for CpG
dense regions of the genome. Bis-seq, RRBS and ERRBS facili-
tate the study of DNA methylation patterns across the genome
in multiple samples and between sample groups.

Recently, ERRBS was used to identify and describe distinct
DNA methylation patterns associated with speciﬁc forms of
acute myeloid leukemias (AML) (Akalin et al., 2012a). AML is
a highly heterogeneous disease both from the clinical and
molecular standpoints, with many distinct molecular subtypes
deﬁned by genetic abnormalities; several of these target key
epigenetic regulators. An estimated 2&25% of all AMLs are
associated with heterozygous somatic mutations of isocitrate de-
hydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDHI 0r 2), or ten-eleven translocation 2
(TETZ) (Patel et al., 2011). Any one of these mutations results in
an impairment of DNA demethylation pathways and leads to the
establishment of a DNA hypermethylation phenotype (Figueroa
et al., 2010a). A separate class of AMLs, constituting ~15% of
all AML cases, are identiﬁed by the presence of the t(8;21)
translocation giving rise to the AMLl/ETO fusion oncoprotein
(Petrie and Zelent, 2007).

A whole genome DNA methylation analysis pipeline

 

Several methods have been published for analysing genome-
wide methylation levels. BSmooth (Hansen et al., 2012), which is
targeted to analyse bis-seq data, uses a smoothing approach
across the genome within each sample to increase the accuracy
of the estimated methylation level for a single CpG site.
BSmooth identiﬁes differentially methylated regions (DMRs)
by combining top ranked differentially methylated cytosines
(DMCs) found using a t—statistics approach with either a quantile
or direct t-statistic cutoff. Methleit (Akalin et al., 2012b) offers
useful annotation features and provides a statistical test by pool-
ing sequencing reads among the individuals in each group. When
multiple samples are present, logistic regression with a binary
predictor is used, which can be formulated as a binomial-based
test. However, methylation levels often vary significantly across
individuals, as observed in cancer samples (Hansen et al., 2011).
Pooling of reads among individuals may result in inﬂated type-I
error rates when testing for group differences. Non-parametric
tests such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test have also been used
to test for DMCs (Nordlund et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013);
however, these tests suffer from a lack of statistical power for
experiments with small sample sizes.

To overcome current limitations, we developed methylSig, a
genome-wide DNA methylation analysis pipeline for use with
bis-seq, RRBS or ERRBS data. MethylSig utilizes a beta-
binomial model across the samples in each defined group for
each CpG site or region to identify either DMCs or DMRs. It
can also incorporate local information across a chromosome to
improve estimates of variances and/or methylation levels.
MethylSig offers annotation functions to map DMCs/DMRs
to gene structures and a unique data Visualization approach to
View several aspects of the data simultaneously across the
genome, providing a platform from which to process, analyse
and Visualize genome-wide methylation data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Beta-binomial approach

If X follows a binomial distribution with number of trials n and the
probability of ‘success’ P, the distribution function of X is
n
P(X=x)= px(l —p)"’x,x=0,l,...,n.
x

In the case that p varies between sets of trials and p~ Beta (or, ,8), we
say X has a beta-binomial distribution with probability mass function

n) l"(or + x)r(,5 + n — x)l"(or + ,3)

P(X: x) = ( m + or + ,B)l"(or)l"(,8)

X

= 7' l"(p.9-l- x)l"((l — p.)9-l-n — x)l"(9)

where 1"(x)= / tx’le” dt. The mean and variance of X are rip. and
0

np.(l — p.){l -l-(n —1)¢>}, where mean p.=or/(or-l-,B). Let 6=a+ﬁ, then
the over-dispersion parameter (1): 1/(1 +6). To simplify the estimation
process, we use 6 instead of :1).

Let Xigj~Beta-Bin(p.,-g6,-, (1 — nig)6,-, nig),g= 1, 2,j= 1, 2, . . . ,Jg,
where Xig, and mg, are number of methylated cytosine reads and coverage

at site i of the fh sample in group g, respectively. Our goal is to test the
hypothesis Hm : p.“ =p.,2 against H“ : p.“ 7e M2.

There are several methods to estimate the parameters mg and 6,, such
as estimation by moments and maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)
(Grifﬁths, 1973), and an alternative method discussed by Tripathi et a].
(1994). Although simple, the estimator from the method of moments is
not from maximizing the likelihood; thus, it is not useful when applying
the likelihood ratio test. Because there is no closed form for the MLE,
obtaining estimates of mg and 6,- simultaneously would be computation-
ally demanding. We propose an approximation method.

The parameter 6,- is a simple function of the over-dispersion parameter.
Because our goal is to compare means from different groups, 6,- is a
nuisance parameter. Based on the Wilks phenomenon results on general-
ized likelihood ratio test (Fan et al., 2001), we can ﬁrst estimate the
nuisance parameter 6,- and use the estimated 9,- to conduct the likelihood
ratio test.

Let (01,“, Ma, 6,) be the log joint likelihood function. We estimate 9,- by
setting dZ(>)/d6,- = 0 (seejsupplement for formulas) while using the
observed group mean  1 xigj/Zj:1n,-gj as the estlmate for Mg. Here
we restrlct 6,- : 0.

Given 6,- = 9,, the MLE for mg, g= 1, 2 is the solution of the equation

d6 A
TUlihllrz, 9i=9i)=0,g= 1,2.
Mig

Under the null hypothesis Hm : p.“ =p.,2 =p.,-, the MLE for u,- is the
solution of the equation

d6 A
7(Mi1=lti,ltr2 = My 91:90:0-
Mi

The likelihood ratio test then becomes

D = 21m, = mg, 6,- = 22,-) — am, = in, e,- = 22.)}.

The distribution of D asymptotically approaches a x? distribution as
sample size increases. However, the distribution of D has significantly
heavier tails than x? for small sample sizes, because it is based on the
estimated nuisance parameter  Motivated by the two-sample t-test,
which can be considered a likelihood ratio test conditional on the esti-
mated variance, we propose the approximation D~t2, where tp is the
Student t distribution with [7 degrees of freedom. Our permutation results
in Section 3.2 show empirically that this is a close approximation, with
the P-values from our proposed method closely matching the expected
P-values under the null. In contrast, the results are noticeably anti-
conservative using the x? distribution (Supplementary Figure S1).

2.2 Simulations

To assess the ability of methylSig to identify true positive DMCs, we
conducted a set of simulations, and compared three versions of
methylSig with four other methods: the binomial-based test of
Methleit, BSmooth, a standard t-test and Wilcoxon rank test. Using
ERRBS data from AML samples (Supplementary Table S1), we gener-
ated data based on the properties of data from chromosome 1 of the ﬁve
IDH1/2 mutated (cancer) and four normal bone marrow (NBM) samples.
This resulted in 65 284 CpG sites for which at least three samples in each
group satisﬁed the required coverage level. When generating data, we
preserved the actual CpG locations and coverage levels for each
sample. To produce data similar to a real situation, we ﬁrst estimated
the site-speciﬁc dispersion parameters using beta-binomial approach and
group mean methylation levels for the normal group using BSmooth. We
then used a beta-binomial distribution with the estimated dispersion par-
ameters and group methylation levels to generate data for the normal

samples and non-DMCs for the cancer samples. For cancer samples at
DMC sites, we randomly chose methylation differences uniformly be-
tween 15% and 30% (weaker signal) or 25% and 40% (stronger
signal). We also simulated three levels of clustering of DMCs into regions,
resulting in six scenarios. We performed 100 simulations for each scen-
ario. We used the percent estimates of methylation to perform the stand-
ard t-test and Wilcoxon rank test. We select top ranked CpG sites based
on t-statistics provided by BSmooth after smoothing.

2.3 Options for combining local information

To incorporate local information when estimating group mean methyla-
tion levels and the dispersion parameters, we also provide a local MLE
using triangular Kernel weights. This method is particularly useful for
small sample sizes and when the group methylation levels or dispersion
parameters are locally similar or highly correlated, as we observed they
are for up to 20(F300 bp windows (Supplementary Figure S2).

For CpG site i, let S: {k : —R 5 k — i 5 R}, where R is a predeﬁned
range in base pairs to combine local information. For CpG sites k in S,
the weight function is H((k — i)/(R-l- 1)). The default function is
H(u) = (1 — u2)3, which can be redeﬁned.

2.4 Identifying enriched or differentially methylated TFs

For each TF in a given database such as ENCODE uniform TF (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/), our goal is to identify which TFs are en-
riched, that is, which TFs’ binding sites have a signiﬁcantly larger pro-
portion of DMCs than the overall proportion of DMCs. Let Ntotal be the
total number of compared CpG sites that can be annotated into TFs and
among these, let NdmC be the total number of identiﬁed DMCs. For the
TF i, let niT be the number of CpG sites and n? be the number of DMCs
within this TF i. We test Ho :17? =17? versus H,-1 :17? 7517?, whereﬁT=
niT /Ntota1 and [30 =nP/Ndmc. Because Ntotal >> Ndmc, we use likelihood
ratio test based on binomial distribution for pf.) and treat [3T as the
known true proportion.

Alternatively, we can ask which TFs have a signiﬁcant level of hyper-
methylation or hypomethylation across their binding sites, which could
indicate whether the TF is having a weaker or stronger regulatory effect,
respectively. To address this, for each sample we ﬁrst tile all reads from
regions to which a particular TF is predicted to bind. We then apply our
beta-binomial model to the data for each TF to identify TFs with hyper-
or hypo-methylated binding sites. This performs a self-contained hypoth-
esis test, in that the level of differential methylation is compared with the
null hypothesis of no differential methylation, as opposed to the level of
differential methylation outside of the TF binding sites.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Overview of methylSig

The methylSig workﬂow proceeds through several steps, from
reading in data to annotating and Visualizing results (Fig. 1). It
accepts methylation data deﬁning the number of Cs and Ts at
each CpG site for multiple samples that are assigned to one of
two or more groups (e.g. mprG methylation call ﬁles from
Bismark software, Krueger and Andrews, 2011). If coverage is
low or the aim is to examine methylation trends, the data may be
tiled within regions of speciﬁed width or local information may
be incorporated to increase power. MethylSig utilizes a beta-
binomial model to compare methylation levels at each CpG
site or tiled region between two groups of samples, as defined
by the user. Parameter estimation includes two stages. In the ﬁrst
stage, the dispersion parameter is estimated at each CpG site or
region; this parameter accounts for the biological variation
among samples within the same group. A weighted likelihood
can be used to incorporate information from nearby CpG sites or
regions. In the second stage, the group methylation level at each
CpG site or region is calculated using the estimated dispersion
parameter; again information can be incorporated from nearby
CpG sites. A statistic based on the likelihood ratio test is used to
evaluate the signiﬁcance level of the difference in methylation.
P—Values and q—Values are calculated based on either a I; (default)
or a x? approximation (recommended for large sample sizes).
Finally, the methylSig package provides data Visualization
and annotation functions as well as functions to identify
enriched TFs.

3.2 Evaluation of type-I error using permutations

To evaluate the type-I error rate of methylSig under the null
hypothesis of no signal, and compare it with that of the binomial
model, we permuted 21 AML samples (Supplementary Table 81)
and tested for DMCs. Sample libraries were prepared using the
ERRBS method (Akalin et al., 2012a), and CpG sites with 310x
but 5500x coverage were included. At each CpG site, there were
521 pairs of percent methylation level and coverage, because

some sites were not covered in some samples; these pairs were
permuted and randomly assigned to samples in two groups (11
‘treatment’ and 10 ‘control’ samples) to generate groups lacking
meaningful methylation differences.

The binomial and beta-binomial tests were applied to calculate
P—Values, which were compared with the expected P—Values under
the null hypothesis of no differential methylation. We analysed
CpG sites covered by at least two samples in both groups.
Results are displayed in QQ—plots of the flog 10(P—Values)
(Fig. 2). For sites covered by at least six samples, methylSig
closely follows the expected P—Value distribution resulting in a
well-calibrated type-I error rate; however, the P—Values from
the binomial model are anti-conservative (Supplementary
Figure S3), with P—Values as low as 1.25 x 10’177 with four
covered samples and 2.7 x 10’285 with 21 samples, and 41%
of CpG sites satisfying False Discovery Rate (FDR)<0.05. In
contrast, the minimum FDR for methylSig was 0.066 among the
2.46 million CpG sites tested.

Fig. 2. QQ-plots of observed versus expected log 10(P-values) for the bi-
nomial and beta-binomial models show that methylSig has a well-cali-
brated type-I error rate when each group has :3 samples (number of
samples = 6). Results from the binomial model consistently show an
inﬂated type-I error rate (gray; shown for four and 21 samples). Data
from 21 samples were permuted among groups for each CpG site

3.3 Simulation

To assess methylSig’s ability to identify true positive DMCs, we
conducted simulations comparing methylSig with four other
methods: a standard t—test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, the binomial
test, and BSmooth. Data were generated to mimic the observed
properties of ERRBS data, including coverage levels and vari-
ation in methylation levels among samples (see Section 2 for
details).

Simulations were performed varying two main parameters, the
range of differences in percent methylation and the level of DMC
clustering into DMRs. The difference in percent methylation
for DMCs or DMRs for a simulation was either randomly
chosen to be between 15% and 30% (to simulate weaker signals)
or 2&40% (stronger signals). We simulated three levels of DMC
clustering. First, we simulated DMCs independently, randomly
choosing 5% of the CpG sites to be DMCs. This simulates situ-
ation that DMCs uncorrelated with neighboring sites. Next
DMCs are simulated to be clustered into regions (DMRs) by
dividing the chromosome into R regions, and randomly selecting
5% of the regions to be DMRs. In the lower level of clustering,
DMCs were assigned to 200 different regions (R = 4000) with
~16 CpG sites in each DMR. In the higher level, DMCs were
assigned to 50 different regions (R = 1000) with ~65 CpG sites
in each DMR. In both cases, the methylation difference for each
CpG site in a DMR was set to be equal.

We compared seven methods: BSmooth, a standard t—test, the
binomial-based test, the Wilcoxon rank test, our site-specific
beta-binomial test, and our beta-binomial test incorporating
local information (dispersion and methylation levels separately)
(Fig. 3). Because not all methods being compared have a appro-
priate type-I error rate, and researchers are often interested in the
top ranked declared DMCs, we compared the proportion of true
DMCs among the total declared DMCs for varying cut-offs for
each method. In all cases, our methods performed as well or
better than the alternatives, with methylSig using local informa-
tion for dispersion estimation outperforming methylSig without
use of local information. This is not surprising given the observed
high correlation of dispersion parameters within a 20(L300 bp
range. MethylSig using local information to estimate methylation
levels outperformed methylSig without use of local information,
for lower and high levels of DMC clustering (narrow and broad
DMRs) (Fig. 3cif), but not for independent DMCs (Fig. 3a and
b). For DMCs that occur independently across CpG sites,
BSmooth has strikingly low detection power (Fig. 3a and b).
The performance of BSmooth improves dramatically for clus-
tered DMCs, with performance similar to the site-speciﬁc version
of methylSig for broad DMRs with 2540% differences in
methylation (Fig. 31). In practice, however, our site-specific test
is potentially more robust because it does not depend on the
assumption of correlated dispersion parameters.

3.4 Site speciﬁc versus tiled analysis

Although a change in methylation at a single CpG site may dis-
rupt gene regulation, in some experiments, the average coverage
per cytosine site may be low, making tiling data a desirable
option to increase power. Much biological regulation occurs
over a wider region covering multiple Cst. Thus tiling
nearby data may provide complementary insights about the

effect of DNA methylation on biological phenotypes. Using the
21 AML samples and four NBM controls, we assessed the
auto-correlation among nearby sites using a weighted Pearson
correlation coefficient to account for the varying levels of cover-
age. We found that on average, adjacent CpG sites had high
correlation (R > 0.9) with correlation dropping rapidly when dis-
tance >20(%300 bp (Supplementary Figure 82a). Currently, each
signiﬁcant tiled region is considered a separate DMR, and 25 bp
is the default size of the tiles. Although we observed this to work
well for RRBS data, users will likely want to increase the tiling
width for bis-seq data.

3.5 Basing variance estimation on normal samples only

DNA methylation levels are often more heterogeneous among
cancer samples than among normal samples of the same tissue
(Hansen et al., 2011). This potentially reduces the power to
identify methylation differences between diseased and normal
samples when the variance is estimated using data from both
groups. An alternative approach, with a slightly different

interpretation of results, is to calculate variances from normal
samples only. This is particularly useful when relevant DNA
methylation changes occur in only a subset of the disease sam-
ples. Such a subset of cancer samples may harbor a common
mutation or have a similar clinical outcome. Thus, we offer the
ability to base variance estimates on just one of the groups in
methylSig. However, because the number of normal samples is
sometimes relatively small, as in our AML example, this ap-
proach also increases the uncertainty of the variance estimates.
Therefore, in these cases and in our implementation below, we
recommend combining information from nearby CpG sites to
obtain more robust variance estimation. This is also motivated
by the observation that not only methylation levels, but also
dispersion estimates are correlated among nearby CpG sites
(R = 0.68 on average for adjacent CpG sites within 25 bp of
each other) (Supplementary Figure S2b).

3.6 Data visualization

MethylSig offers a unique two-tiered Visualization of the methy-
lation data depending on the zoom level. For narrow regions
(recommended for <100 kb) where at most 500 CpG sites have
data reads, users can Visualize sample-specific coverage levels and
percent methylation at each site, together with group averages,
significance levels and a number of genomic annotations
(Fig. 4a). To assess the potential biological impact and differen-
tial methylation events, we also annotate these CpG sites to the
genomic context, including CpG islands and shores, RefGene
information (promoter, untranslated region (UTR), intron,
exon, non-coding RNA and intergenic regions), and TFs. This
is important when interpreting DNA methylation differences,
because the presence of methylcytosine may have different effects
on gene regulation depending on the context of the genomic
region (van Vlodrop et al., 2011). For broad regions, the Visual-
ization is simpliﬁed to the locations of multiple genomic features
(e.g. CpG islands, enhancer regions, etc) along with log lo-scale
significance levels of the DMCs/DMRs (Fig. 4b).

3.7 Implementation of methylSig with ERRBS data from
multiple subtypes of AML

3.7.] Subtypes of AML Among the 21 ERRBS samples used in
our permutation analysis, we classiﬁed 13 samples into the
following three subgroups: IDHI/Z mutated (n = 5), TET2
mutated (n = 4) and AMLl/ETO fusion (11 = 4). An additional
four samples correspond to NBM specimens obtained from
healthy donors. Figueroa et al. (2010a) previously showed that
these AML subtypes display distinct DNA methylation patterns.

We applied the beta-binomial and binomial models to identify
DMCs or DMRs (using 25 bp windows) characterizing the AML
subtypes and normal samples for CpG sites covered by at least
three samples in each group. Signiﬁcant DMCs/DMRs were
deﬁned as those CpG sites or regions with FDR 5 0.05 and esti-
mated methylation difference 325%.

3.7.2 Site-speciﬁc analysis Both the beta-binomial and bino-
mial models found substantial numbers of DMCs. However, as
expected based on the anti-conservative nature of the binomial
model, we found substantially more DMCs using the binomial
model than beta-binomial model (Fig. 5a). With beta-binomial

model we identiﬁed largely different numbers of DMCs when
comparing IDHI/Z mutation, TET2 mutation, or AMLl/ETO
gene fusion to NBM samples. Samples harboring IDHI/Z muta-
tions have previously been reported to have broader and more
severe effects on DNA methylation compared with AMLs with
TET2 (Figueroa et al., 2010a). Indeed, we identiﬁed ~6x more
DMCs in the IDHI/Z group than in the TET2 group with
methylSig. In contrast, the binomial model identiﬁed more
(~1.7><) DMCs in the TET2 group. Both groups have been
observed to have a strong bias toward hypermethylation.
Using methylSig, 98% of IDHI/Z and 88% of TET2 DMCs
were hypermethylated compared with NBM. Strong effects on
DNA methylation were also observed in samples harboring the
AMLl/ETO gene fusion, although approximately equal num-
bers of hyper- and hypo-methylated sites were observed in this
subtype (Figueroa et al., 2010a) (Fig. 5a). For both of these

(>1mb), the visualization function does not show data. It is helpful to
identify regions where DMCs or DMRs exist, and then zoom in to a
particular region of interest. (b) When zoomed in to a small region
(< lmb or at most 500 CpG sites with data), users can visualize the
coverage levels, percent methylation levels and group mean methylation
estimates at each CpG site. Different letters represent different samples,
and the size of each letter represents the read coverage at that CpG site
for the related sample. Letter with color (consistent with CpG island
annotation) presents treatment group (IDH1/2 mutation) and black for
control group (normal). Red and black dots and lines represent the group
estimates for treatment and control groups, respectively. CpG islands and
shores, intergenic regions, —log 10(P-values) and protein-DNA binding
sites are shown in the annotation tracks below the methylation data

AML subtypes, methylSig identiﬁed several thousand DMCs.
In contrast, Binomial model identiﬁed more similar numbers of
DMCs between each of the AML subtypes and NBM samples,
with the fewest DMCs found for IDHI/Z, and only 87% and
63% of the DMCs were hypermethylated in IDHI/Z and TET2
samples, respectively. The beta-binomial model also tends to
identify DMCs with a larger percent methylation change than
binomial model, such that the small P—Value is more highly asso-
ciated with large percent methylation change using beta-binomial
model than it is with binomial model (Supplementary Figure S4).
For example, removing the minimum methylation difference of
25% criteria increases the number (%) of DMCs for IDHI/Z
from 116605 (7.8%) to 607 745 (40.4%) using the binomial
model, but only increases the number from 8521 (0.57%) to
11018 (0.73%) using our beta-binomial method.

Mapping CpG sites to CpG islands and gene bodies using
RefGene models, as can be seen for IDHI/Z compared with
NBM from Figure 6a, ~49% of CpG sites covered by the
ERRBS assay are annotated to a CpG island; this percent
increased to 62% among identiﬁed DMCs. Conversely, the per-
centage of CpG sites from inter-CpG island regions decreased
from 33% covered by ERRBS overall to 20% among DMCs.

CpG shores and shelves were neither enriched nor depleted with
DMCs. This result is consistent with previous observations re-
garding the patterns of DMCs in IDH-mutant AMLs (Akalin
et al., 2012a). We did not observe enrichment of DMCs in any
regions defined by gene structure, including promoter, 5/ or 3/
UTR, coding sequence (CDS) (intron and exon), and non-coding
RNA when using RefGene models (Fig. 6b) . Using methylSig to
test for TFs with potentially enriched DMCs in their binding
sites, we identiﬁed an extremely strong enrichment of Suz12
sites (P-Value: 2.4 x 10’190) (Fig. 6c). Suz12 is a component of
the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which trimethy-
lates lysine 27 of histone 3. DNA regions normally harboring this
histone mark in embryonic stem cells have been observed to be
hypermethylated in multiple types of cancer (Widschwendter
et al., 2006). This suggests that PRC2 target sites also have a
strong tendency toward hypermethylation in IDHI/Z mutant
AML samples. An enrichment of Suz12 sites was also observed
for the TET2 and AMLl/ETO subtypes (P—Values: 4.7 x 10’9
and .., respectively), and for Brf2 and P013 sites in the AMLl/
ETO subtype (Supplementary Figure 85).

3.7.3 Tiled analysis For the tiled analysis, we divided the
genome into regions of continuous non-overlapping 25 bp win-
dows and tiled (pooled) data within each region. Similar to the
site-speciﬁc analysis, both the binomial and beta-binomial meth-
ods identiﬁed substantial numbers of DMRs. As expected due to
the increase in statistical power from pooling data from nearby

Fig. 6. Annotation results from comparing IDHI/Z mutant to NBM
samples. (a) When annotating CpG sites to CpG island, 13% more
CpG sites (from 49% to 62%) are annotated to CpG islands in DMCs

When using ENCODE uniform TF information, Suz12 is the only one
TF that is signiﬁcantly enriched in DMCs compared with all CpG sites
used to identify DMCs

sites, methylSig (Fig. 5b) identiﬁed more DMRs for all subtypes
of AMLs compared with the site-speciﬁc analyses. Again, the
great majority, 97% and 88.0%, of DMRs were hypermethy-
lated for IDHI/Z and TET2 compared with NBM, respectively.
In contrast, fewer significant changes were identiﬁed using tiled
analysis with the binomial model, with the IDHI/Z subtype again
having the fewest signiﬁcant changes, and 85% and 64% of
DMRs hypermethylated for IDHI/Z and TET2 subtypes,
respectively.

3. 7.4 Basing variance estimation on normal samples only and using
local information When estimating variance from normal sam-
ples, many CpG sites with severe heterogeneities among cancer
patients are identiﬁed as DMCs. To show the utility of this ap-
proach we combined the 13 AML samples, simulating a situation
where there is no prior knowledge about molecular subtype, and
compared this heterogeneous group to the NBM samples using
both variance estimation methods (all samples and normal-only
samples) with methylSig. We then determined which sites were
identiﬁed as DMCs in the ‘normal-only’ analysis to help under-
stand and explore the possibility of cancer subtypes. Clustering
the 13 AMLs and four normal samples based on these DMCs
separated the AML subtypes and normal samples, with only one
IDHI/Z outlier (Fig. 7). Clustering the samples based on DMCs
using all samples to estimate variance was not able to separate
the subtypes (Supplementary Figure S6).

When estimating variance with local information, as expected,
many more DMCs were identified (3.}12x, Fig. 5a and 0,
bottom results). This option of using local information is
useful when nearby CpG sites have similar variation across sam-
ples within each group. We suggested using 2007300 bp window
in each direction based on our observations (Supplementary
Figure S2). The patterns of the results are similar with or without
local information. We found that most DMCs are hyper-
methylated when comparing IDHI/Z or TET2 mutation group
to normal samples, while there was no significant difference
between percent hyper- and hypomethylated when comparing

AMLl/ETO samples to normal samples. When combining local
information with using normal samples only to estimate variance
option, interestingly, we found the number of identiﬁed DMCs
when comparing TET2 to normal samples changed from the
least to the most (Fig. 5c). This suggests the possible stronger
methylation heterogeneity across samples in TET2 mutation

group.

4 DISCUSSION

Statistical analysis of genome-wide bis-seq experiments with
multiple biological samples per group is challenging due to
heterogeneous read coverage and methylation levels, relatively
small sample sizes and the large number of tests required for a
site-speciﬁc analysis. Appropriately applying a statistical
method to adjust for biological variation, and using informa-
tion from nearby CpG sites to improve estimation, can signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the false positive findings while maximizing
power. Here, we introduced methylSig, a genome-wide DNA
methylation analysis pipeline for bis-seq or RRBS/ERRBS
data that estimates biological variation using a beta-binomial
approach and maintains a well-calibrated type-I error rate.
MethylSig is able to incorporate local information to improve
the estimation of variances and group methylation levels. Our
simulation results show that in terms of sensitivity, methylSig
outperforms both standard statistical tests such as the t-test
and Wilcoxon rank test, as well as BSmooth and the binomial
test of Methleit under a variety of realistic scenarios. Our
method reduces false positive ﬁndings by ﬁltering out sites that
have a high difference in percent methylation, but are too
heterogeneous or have very low of coverage in many samples
to be of biological relevance.

Our analyses using ERRBS methylation data from AML
and NBM samples showed that methylSig can lead to statis-
tically and biologically relevant results. One subgroup of AML
samples had mutations in either IDH] or IDH2. Nearly all of
the DMCs in cancers with neomorphic IDHI/Z mutations are
expected to be hypermethylated, because they lead to abnor-
mally high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is a direct in-
hibitor of the TET DNA demethylases required to convert
5 mC to 5 th 0(u et al., 2011). Similarly, loss-of—function
mutations in TET2 result in impaired DNA demethylation
(Figueroa et al., 2010b; Ko et al., 2010). Although most of
the DMCs in the TET2 mutant subgroup are also expected to
be hypermethylated, this occurs to a lesser degree than for the
IDHI/Z group due to the possible partial compensation by
other TET proteins. The great majority of DMCs identiﬁed
by methylSig in these two subgroups were hypermethylated.

Compared to Methleit, which uses a binomial model with-
out adjusting for biological variation, we demonstrated that our
approach performs favorably in terms of type-I error rate, and
correlation between signiﬁcance and percent methylation change.
Recently, more sophisticated methods based on Bayesian hier-
archical models have been published (Feng et al., 2014; Sun
et al., 2014). Although these methods also make use of a beta-
binomial model, they differ from methylSig by using priors for
the methylation levels (Sun et al., 2014) or dispersion parameters
(Feng et al., 2014) based on the entire data; methylSig, in

contrast, incorporates local information for methylation levels
and/ or dispersion parameters.

For sites that are highly heterogeneous in both groups,
methylSig may not be able to identify regions that are import-
ant for a subgroup of samples. This is similar to other trad-
itional statistical methods that test for signiﬁcant group
differences. In this case, a test for a signiﬁcant subgroup,
such as cancer outlier proﬁle analysis used for expression
data and implemented in Oncomine (Tomlins et al., 2005),
may be more appropriate. In cases where one of the groups
(e.g. controls) is more homogeneous, users may estimate vari-
ance based only on that group in order to identify regions
potentially important in a subset of the diseased samples,
which are likely more heterogeneous overall.

MethylSig can also be used to analyse alternative cytosine
methylation contexts. Finally, the methylSig R package
provides a unique Visualization approach and useful annota-
tion functions.

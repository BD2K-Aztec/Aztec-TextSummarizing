ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many current studies of complex microbial communities
rely on the isolation of community genomic DNA, amplification of
16S ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) and subsequent examination of
community structure through interrogation of the amplified 16S rDNA
pool by high-throughput sequencing, phylogenetic microarrays or
quantitative PCR.

Results: Here we describe the development of a mathematical
model aimed to simulate multitemplate amplification of 16S
ribosomal DNA sample and subsequent detection of these amplified
16S rDNA species by phylogenetic microarray. Using parameters
estimated from the experimental results obtained in the analysis
of intestinal microbial communities with Microbiota Array, we show
that both species detection and the accuracy of species abundance
estimates depended heavily on the number of PCR cycles used
to amplify 16S rDNA. Both parameters initially improved with
each additional PCR cycle and reached optimum between 15 and
20 cycles of amplification. The use of more than 20 cycles of
PCR amplification and/or more than 50 ng of starting genomic
DNA template was, however, detrimental to both the fraction of
detected community members and the accuracy of abundance
estimates. Overall, the outcomes of the model simulations matched
well available experimental data. Our simulations also showed that
species detection and the accuracy of abundance measurements
correlated positively with the higher sample-wide PCR amplification
rate, lower template-to-template PCR bias and lower number of
species in the interrogated community. The developed model can
be easily modified to simulate other multitemplate DNA mixtures as
well as other microarray designs and PCR amplification protocols.

1 INTRODUCTION

Owing to the development and reﬁnement of novel DNA and
RNA interrogation technologies, there is a surge of studies in the
current literature exploring the populational structure and function

of various complex microbial communities (Brodie et (11., 2007;
Gao et (11., 2007; Huber et (11., 2007). The ability to isolate and
subsequently examine total community DNA and RNA without any
need to culture individual microbial species and cells allows analysis
of systems that would otherwise be difﬁcult to proﬁle and examine
including microbiota of human intestine and other epithelial surfaces
and the microbes of soils and ocean waters (Eckburg et (11., 2005;
Gao et (11., 2007; Huber et (11., 2007; Kent and Triplett, 2002).

Gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit RNA molecule (l6S
rRNA in prokaryotes and 185 rRNA in eukaryotes) has been used
in the vast majority of such studies due to its ubiquitous presence
in all organisms and because of the conservation of its nucleotide
sequence (Cannone et (11., 2002). In a typical experimental design to
proﬁle microbial community structure, total genomic DNA (gDNA)
isolated from a sample of interest is subjected to rounds of 165
rRNA gene (rDNA) speciﬁc ampliﬁcation in polymerase Chain
reaction (PCR) using two ‘universal’ primers complementary to the
beginning and the end of prokaryotic l6S rRNA molecule (Frank
et (11., 2008). The ampliﬁed DNA is then interrogated by a detection
method of Choice such as DNA sequencing or microarray analysis.
Because on average 165 rRNA gene constitutes only ~ 0.25% of the
total genomic DNA (see below), selective l6S rDNA ampliﬁcation
is crucial to increase the sensitivity of detection (Paliy et (11., 2009)
and to obtain good measures of bacterial presence and relative
abundance in the community samples. However, the optimal use
of such PCR ampliﬁcation in relation to microarray and DNA
sequencing detection have not been yet fully explored.

A number of studies have been published, though, examining
the thermodynamic behavior of DNA molecules during DNA
ampliﬁcation, and the biases that can be observed during many
rounds of PCR ampliﬁcation (Kanagawa, 2003; Kurata et (11., 2004;
Poll and Cavanaugh, 1998). Because most microbial communities
consist of a large number of different microbial species with varied
l6S rRNA gene sequences, any PCR ampliﬁcation of community
DNA is multitemplate. PCR ampliﬁcation of such gDNA has been
shown to introduce a deviation of the post-ampliﬁcation fractions
from the initial ratios of DNA molecules (termed PCR bias) due to
unequal ampliﬁcation of different DNA molecules during PCR (Poll
and Cavanaugh, 1998). Several mechanisms of this effect have been
described that include (i) unequal denaturation of templates based
on GC content of DNA sequences; (ii) higher binding efﬁciency of
GC-rich variants of degenerate ampliﬁcation primers to the template
at the same annealing temperature; and (iii) competitive re-annealing

of abundant templates at later ampliﬁcation cycles discriminating
against major templates (Kurata et (11., 2004; Polz and Cavanaugh,
1998; Sachse, 2004; Sipos, et (11., 2007). In addition, the stochastic
nature of the PCR ampliﬁcation process during the ﬁrst few cycles
of ampliﬁcation can lead to a reaction-speciﬁc skew in relative
distribution of ampliﬁed templates producing so-called PCR drift
(Polz and Cavanaugh, 1998; Wagner et (11., 1994). Finally, genomic
DNA isolated from environmental sources or human bodily ﬂuids
such as fecal matter is known to often contain PCR inhibitors that
are able to signiﬁcantly impede DNA ampliﬁcation sample-wide
(Lantz et (11., 2000). All these mechanisms result in a skew of
the product-to-template ratios for most DNA species in complex
samples.

Several studies have provided theoretical framework aimed
to describe the individual components of the PCR or to
simulate a particular PCR bias. Initial efforts focused on the
modeling of individual biochemical reactions including template—
enzyme kinetics (Schnell and Mendoza, 1997), DNA renaturation
(Wetmur and Davidson, 1968) and DNA re-annealing (Suzuki
and Giovannoni, 1996). Two recent studies described detailed
simulations of kinetic processes of PCR based on the calculations
of mass preservation and equilibrium coefﬁcients (Lee et (11., 2006;
Mehra and Hu, 2005). Both studies focused on the behavior of
single-template ampliﬁcation process, and in addition provided
considerations of biochemical constants for each equilibrium
reaction.

In this work, we extend these previous PCR simulations with a
quantitative model of multitemplate PCR ampliﬁcation of complex
16S ribosomal DNA mixture derived from the simulated genome
pool of 400 different microbial species. The multitemplate PCR
ampliﬁcation is computationally assessed through the detection of
ampliﬁed 16S ribosomal DNA by phylogenetic microarray.

2 METHODS

2.1 General model description

A typical experimental procedure of microbial community analysis consists
of selective ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA from the total genomic DNA.
applying the pool of ampliﬁed and total gDNA onto a microarray. and
then measuring hybridization of this mixture to different microarray probes.
Detection of bacterial species of intestinal microbiota with Microbiota Array
(Paliy at (11.. 2009) was used as a model of this method. In the in silico
simulation of the interrogation process. developed in Matlab (version 7.3.
The Mathworks. Inc.). the starting gDNA sample was subjected to successive
rounds of PCR ampliﬁcation producing a mixed sample containing original
gDNA and ampliﬁed 16S rDNA molecules. After each PCR ampliﬁcation
round. detection of 16S rDNA species in the mixture was assessed by the
microarray detection algorithm.

2.2 Model of the multitemplate PCR

The process of PCR ampliﬁcation was simulated for each bacterial species
in the mixture individually. and the accumulation of ampliﬁed 16S rDNA
was modeled for each species as:

N
PN=P0 xn(1+AE,) (1)

[:1

where PN is the total ampliﬁed 16S rDNA after N cycles of PCR
ampliﬁcation. P0 is the starting amount of 16S rDNA and AE, is ampliﬁcation
efﬁciency at cycle 1 for each species 16S rDNA (Schnell and Mendoza. 1997).

the templateiprimeraenzymeinucleotide complex (growing complementary
nucleotide chain) at equilibrium. The last term in the equation models
the adjustment of ampliﬁcation efﬁciency based on biochemical reaction
equilibria and takes into account template self-annealing (Mehra and
Hu. 2005). template-speciﬁc PCR bias due to variability of the 16S
rDNA nucleotide sequences complementary to universal primers among
different species (Polz and Cavanaugh, 1998) and sample-wide reduction
in ampliﬁcation efﬁciency due to enzyme and nucleotide resource limitation
(Lee at (11.. 2006; Mehra and Hu. 2005; Sachse. 2004). A detailed description
of the mathematical model is available in Supplementary Material.

2.3 Simulation of microarray detection

Microarray analysis of species 16S rDNA in the ampliﬁed sample was
simulated by comparing the amount of each species rDNA versus the
microarray detection limit (see below). If the species-speciﬁc 16S rDNA
amount was above detection limit. the corresponding species was treated as
detected. and its gDNA abundance was equal to its 16S rDNA amount in the
ampliﬁed mixture. Otherwise. the species was treated as undetected. and its
measured gDNA abundance was assumed to be 0.

2.4 Parameter estimation

The following modeling parameters and coefﬁcients were estimated
(Table 1):

(1) Yield of PCR ampliﬁcation as a function of the amount of
starting material: PCR ampliﬁcation yield was estimated from semi-
quantitative PCR tests that utilized between 50 and 500ng of
gDNA template and between 15 and 30 cycles of ampliﬁcation
(Supplementary Fig. $1). The yield rate (deﬁned as the ratio of
the ﬁnal ampliﬁed amount divided by the starting DNA amount)

diminished as the starting DNA amount increased. The yield rates
were used to empirically estimate KINH (Table 1).

(2) Sample-wide rate of PCR ampliﬁcation: quantitative PCR tests.
utilizing small amounts of genomic DNA to reduce possible inhibitory
effect(s). were carried out as described previously (Paliy at (11.. 2009)
to estimate AEMAX. The average ampliﬁcation rate was 1.75 for the
exponential phase of PCR giving AEMAX of 0.75. a value comparable
to other reports (Acinas at (11.. 2005; Frank at (11.. 2008).

(3) Distribution of PCR biases due to primer annealing variability: based
on experimental data (Rigsbee 61611., 2011). the PCR bias was modeled
as lognormal distribution of the templateiprimer complex formation
constant. The SD of the natural logarithm was set to 1.74 in order to
produce a distribution of species-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation rates matching
experimental median per-cycle bias of 1.59% (Rigsbee at (11.. 2011).

(4) Microbiota array detection and experimental conditions: the minimum
detection limit of the microarray was estimated from the microarray
validation experiments to be between 2.5 and 10 pg of 16S rDNA
(Paliy at (11.. 2009). The detection limit was modeled as a normal
distribution function with mean of 5 pg. SD of 2 pg and minimum of
1 pg. The number of bacterial species in the interrogated sample was
set to 400 (Rigsbee at (11.. 2011). The distribution of starting amounts
of each bacterial species in the mixture was modeled by the square of
an exponential function and varied over four orders of magnitude. This
produced a distribution of species DNA abundances heavily skewed
toward low abundance members to match experimental data (Paliy
at (11.. 2009; Rigsbee 61611., 2011). The model assumed that 1500 ng of
combined pool of ampliﬁed 16S rDNA and initial gDNA was added to
each microarray (Paliy at (11.. 2009). If necessary. multiple simulated
PCRs were combined to obtain this 1500 ng of total material.

(5

V

165 gDNA fraction: fraction of the 16S rDNA per bacterial genome
was estimated by multiplying the average 16S rDNA gene copy
number (6.0) by average 16S rDNA gene length (1500 bp) and
dividing the product by average prokaryotic genome size (3.6 Mb)7
this produced a 0.0025 fraction. NCBI microbial genomes and rrnDB
databases were used to obtain these averages.

2.5 Measured outcomes of the simulated processes

Model simulations were focused on the analysis of how species detection
and accuracy of community composition measurements by phylogenetic
microarray depended on the amount of starting gDNA material for PCR
ampliﬁcation and the number of PCR ampliﬁcation cycles the samples are
subjected to (Bonnet at (11.. 2002; Rigsbee at (11.. 2011).

The model was run with all parameters deﬁned as shown in Table 1. while
varying the amount of starting material and the number of 16S rDNA-speciﬁc
cycles of PCR ampliﬁcation. One hundred repeated simulations were carried
out for each different amount of starting material and different number of
PCR ampliﬁcation cycles. and the simulation results were averaged among
repeats.

Two outputs of the model were used to assess the simulation: (i) the
fraction of bacterial species detected by the microarray and the (ii) accuracy
of quantitative measurement of bacterial relative abundance. Additional
model outcomes such as fraction of nucleotides and primers used. total
reaction yield and cycle-to-cycle ampliﬁcation rate changes were also
tracked. The accuracy of species abundance measurements was deﬁned as:

N lSP.FRAC,TRUE—SP.FRAC,EXPl
Z W NSPECIES

i:l

where SP.FRAC-,»CRUE is the true fraction of 16S rDNA represented by species
1 in the initial sample. SP.FRAC§EXP is the fraction of 16S rDNA represented
by species 1 estimated by microarray interrogation of PCR-ampliﬁed sample
and NSPECIES is the total number of species in the sample. SP.FRAC§EXP for
all undetected species was set to 0. In words. this accuracy measure is the

average of the absolute fractional error for each species fraction estimate.
A lower value represents greater accuracy. with a zero value being perfect
accuracy.

2.6 Model limitations

Several parameters known to inﬂuence the behavior of standard PCRs were
omitted from the model for simplicity because they were not found to be
modiﬁed often in phylogenetic studies examined. These included Mg2+
concentration. varying annealing temperature and temperature ramp rate.
Because DNA polymerases currently used for PCRs are very thermostable.
denaturation of the enzyme during PCR was considered to be insigniﬁcant.
Since our model was focused on the determination of ampliﬁcation efﬁciency
of each template at each PCR cycle. it did not include detailed simulation
of the biochemistry of melting and extension reactions that were considered
in detail previously (Lee at (11.. 2006; Mehra and Hu. 2005). Nevertheless.
the behavior of our PCR simulation was similar to those reported elsewhere
(Lee at (11.. 2006; Mehra and Hu. 2005). Finally. our algorithm did not model
complexities of microarray hybridization behavior and bias; rather it assumed
a perfect measurement of each species abundance as long as it was above
the microarray detection limit.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Fraction of bacterial detection

Figure 1A and B displays detection fraction of microbial species
in the sample as a factor of the number of PCR ampliﬁcation
cycles and the amount of starting material. As expected, bacterial
detection increased with an initial increase in the number of PCR
ampliﬁcation cycles. The curves of species detection fraction
were similar when starting material was kept <50ng. After initial
increase, the detection fraction started to plateau out around 15th
PCR cycle and reached maximum level around cycle 20 (91—93% of
bacterial species detected for samples with < 50ng starting gDNA).
The detection slowly decreased with ﬁirther PCR ampliﬁcation
to ~90%.

The detection fraction curve was different for samples with higher
starting amounts of gDNA. When increasing initial gDNA template
from 100 ng to 1000 ng, the rate of detection became progressively
lower. At 15 cycles of PCR ampliﬁcation, 86, 78, 71 and 63% of
all species in the sample were detected for samples containing 100,
300, 600 and 1000 ng of starting genomic DNA, respectively. The
lower rate of detection is explained in part by an increased amount of
PCR inhibitors in large gDNA samples reducing the rate of template
ampliﬁcation. The initial sample-wide ampliﬁcation rate dropped
from 1.75 for reactions with 1—50 ng starting material to 1.50 for
samples with 1000 ng of starting gDNA (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Elevated template self-annealing in large samples also contributed
to a lower ampliﬁcation rate. In addition, because of higher initial
concentration of DNA templates, PCR reached resource limitation
stage faster for larger gDNA samples. A drop in the ampliﬁcation
rate occurred at cycle 20 for PCR with 1 ng starting gDNA versus
cycle 10 for reactions with 1000 ng starting gDNA (Supplementary
Fig. S2). This lowered the 16S rDNA enrichment factor of the
ampliﬁed samples (Supplementary Fig. S3). Whereas 16S rDNA
constituted 86% of total sample after 15 cycles of PCR ampliﬁcation
for sample containing 1 ng of starting gDNA (99% after 20 cycles),
this fraction was 73% for 100 ng starting gDNA sample (83% after
20 cycles, 93% after 40 cycles) and only 22% for 1000 ng starting
gDNA sample (30% after 20 cycles, 51% after 40 cycles). The initial

fraction of 16S rDNA in genomic DNA samples was 0.25%. The
relative fractions of detection at 15, 20, 25 and 30 cycles of PCR
ampliﬁcation observed in our simulations were in good accordance
with our previous experimental analyses of human fecal samples
using Microbiota Array (Rigsbee et (11., 2011).

Carrying out PCR ampliﬁcation past 20 cycles actually led to a
slight reduction of species detection in samples with small starting
amount of gDNA. This was connected to the existence of the
simulated PCR bias among different species, since species detection
did not drop when PCR bias was turned off (Fig. 2C). Our simulation
results are consistent with previous observations that the use of
large number of PCR ampliﬁcation cycles to enrich genomic DNA
samples with 16S rDNA results in reduced estimates of microbial
community diversity (Bonnet et (11., 2002).

3.2 Accuracy of 16S rDNA abundance measurements

Figure 1C and D displays the accuracy of microarray estimation of
species relative abundance in a sample. Independent of the amount
of starting material used, the accuracy of community composition
estimates improved with an initial increase in the number of PCR
ampliﬁcation cycles a sample was subjected to. The optimum
accuracy was inversely proportional to the starting gDNA amount:
it was similar for samples with 1—10ng of starting gDNA, but
was progressively worse for samples with higher starting gDNA
amounts. The best accuracy (minimum value on Figure 1C and D
graphs) was observed at cycle number 17, 15, 12 and 11 for samples

with 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng of starting gDNA, respectively. In all
cases, the accuracy then started to decline sharply as the number of
PCR ampliﬁcation cycles continued to grow.

Several different effects inﬂuenced the observed accuracy of
16S rDNA abundance measurements. Since many bacterial species
are not detected in samples subjected to a low number of PCR
ampliﬁcation cycles, this leads to a poor concordance of relative
abundance values between initial (true) and measured sample
compositions. However, because each additional PCR ampliﬁcation
cycle skews the original distribution of species abundances due to
unequal ampliﬁcation efﬁciency of 16S rDNA of different species,
use of many PCR ampliﬁcation cycles leads to a signiﬁcant overall
deviation of measured signals from the initial species distribution
(Fig. 2D). In addition, template self-annealing introduced another
ampliﬁcation deviation in samples with higher starting gDNA that
inﬂuenced the position of optimum accuracy (see Supplementary
Fig. S4). Thus, even though a progressively higher fraction of
community members is detected until at least the 20th PCR
ampliﬁcation cycle, accumulation of PCR ampliﬁcation biases leads
to optimum accuracy being reached at an earlier cycle.

3.3 Sensitivity analysis of estimated model parameters

To test the dependence of model predictions on values chosen for
key parameters, sensitivity analyses were carried out where each
parameter was systematically permuted while keeping all other

the complementarity of ampliﬁcation primers used and by speciﬁc

accuracy of abundance estimates. As expected, the slope of detection

fraction was generally proportional to the PCR ampliﬁcation rate.
The 90% detection point was reached at PCR cycle 12, 14, 17 and 21
for reactions with ampliﬁcation rates of 2.00, 1.75, 1.60 and 1.45,
respectively. The highest detection fraction was the same for all
simulations and thus was independent from the starting ampliﬁcation
rate. The optimum accuracy was generally observed for the PCR
cycle that corresponded to detection fraction reaching 90% level.

Template PCR ampliﬁcation bias: due to the differences in the
primer annealing and in sequence replication rates, different 16S
rDNA species display slightly different rates of PCR ampliﬁcation,
which in a complex sample can lead to deviations of the post-PCR
template ratios from the original sample composition. A number
of approaches to experimentally affect PCR bias level are known
and can be used (Kurata et a1., 2004; Sipos et a1., 2007). For this
sensitivity analysis, the SD of the template—primer equilibrium Kgg
constant was systematically permuted to determine the inﬂuence of
PCR bias level on both the detection and accuracy performance
of microarray measurements (Fig. 2C and D). Maximum detection
fraction was inversely proportional to the bias level. With a 0.15%
median per-cycle ampliﬁcation rate bias, 95% of species were
detected in our simulations; however, this fraction dropped to 87%
for ampliﬁcations with 5.9% median per-cycle bias (Fig. 2C).

An even larger negative effect of PCR ampliﬁcation bias was
observed for the accuracy of abundance measurements (Fig. 2D).
This was expected since each PCR cycle introduces deviations into
relative species abundances. With PCR bias close to 0, accuracy
stayed at the same level after reaching an optimum.

Concentration of ampliﬁcation primers: Figure 2E and F
shows simulation results of varying the initial concentration of
ampliﬁcation primers. Because in stande PCR primers are always
in abundance compared with the amount of template (2.6 X 10_12 M
of 16S rDNA template in 50 ng of total genomic DNA versus 2.0 X
10_7 M of each primer), primer concentrations are often assumed
to be invariant during PCR. Somewhat unexpectedly, both of the
main assessed parameters showed primer concentration dependence.
Though the optimum accuracy and the highest detection fraction
were generally not affected, the decline in both parameters with
higher number of ampliﬁcation cycles was inversely proportional
to the overall primer concentration in the reaction. Increasing
each primer concentration beyond 350—400 nM had negligible
additional effect. Our ﬁnding can be explained by the fact that
because phylogenetically conserved primers with several degenerate
positions are often used in 16S rDNA ampliﬁcation studies (Paliy
et a1., 2009), the actual effective concentrations of each forward
and reverse primer for each speciﬁc 16S rDNA template are likely
signiﬁcantly lower. This effect was included in our model. A lower
effective primer concentration will lead to a lower overall template
ampliﬁcation rate through shifting the reaction equilibrium. This
reduction will be particularly noticeable when concentration of the
templates is comparable with primer amounts at the later stages of
PCR ampliﬁcation.

Number of species in the community sample: based on the
previous analysis of intestinal microbial communities (Rigsbee
et a1., 2011), our simulations were run with 400 species members.
However, community diversity is expected to be vastly different
for diverse ecological environments and microbial communities.
Figure 2G and H shows detection and accuracy results for
simulations where community complexity was varied between 160
and 640 members. As expected, overall fraction of species detection

decreased with an increase in the number of community members,
since the same amount of genomic DNA was distributed among
larger number of members. We detected all members of the 160-
member community but only ~ 84% of the 640-member community.
A similar relationship was also observed for accuracy estimates—
microarray results were generally more accurate for a low-member
community due to the higher fraction of detected members.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have developed the ﬁrst detailed model of
PCR ampliﬁcation and microarray detection for the quantitative
analysis of microbial community structure. Model performance
matched well available experimental data including total number
of detected species, total PCR reaction yield and species detection
differences for 15, 20, 25 and 30 cycles of PCR ampliﬁcation
[see Supplementary Table S1 and (Rigsbee et a1., 2011)]. Model
simulations led to the following conclusions:

(1) Species detection showed a positive relationship with the
number of PCR ampliﬁcation cycles and lower template-
to-template ampliﬁcation bias. On the other hand, it was
inversely proportional to the number of species comprising
the interrogated community. A detection fraction plateau was
reached in each case due to a signiﬁcant and quick drop in
the PCR ampliﬁcation rate once the template concentration
became high enough to affect chemical reaction equilibria.

(2) Accuracy of 16S rDNA abundance measurements had a
non-monotonic relationship with most tested parameters.
The accuracy initially improved with each successive PCR
ampliﬁcation cycle due to a signiﬁcant increase in the fraction
of detected species. However, once reaching an optimum, the
accuracy started to decline due to the rising PCR ampliﬁcation
bias with each additional ampliﬁcation cycle. Overall, PCR
ampliﬁcation bias had the most profound effect on the
detection and accuracy estimates among all parameters tested
in our model.

(3) A caution has to be exercised when comparing species
composition and abundance among microbial communities
with signiﬁcantly different numbers of community members.
With the same experimental protocol used, a community with
many members will have a lower detection fraction than a
community with fewer species. Thus, the actual differences
among such communities would be underestimated.

(4) Not surprisingly, our experiments indicated that the total
yield of PCR ampliﬁcation correlated positively with the
amount of starting material as well as with the number of
ampliﬁcation cycles employed. The yield neared a plateau in
each case (Supplementary Fig. S5) which coincided with a
drop in the PCR ampliﬁcation rate (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Previous studies also showed that efﬁciency of DNA duplex
denaturation is decreased at higher concentrations, which
leads to poor PCR performance when too much sample
DNA is added to the mixture (Sachse, 2004). While this
indicates that carrying out many PCRs with smaller amounts
of starting material will produce the best overall yield from
the same amount of available gDNA, the use of many PCRs
carries signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and labor costs that also must

be considered. The same amount of material (1500 ng) was
‘loaded’ onto the microarray in our simulations; therefore,
for reactions with small starting amounts and low number of
PCR ampliﬁcation cycles, the simulation assumed that many
PCRs were combined to achieve the needed load. This is not
likely to be practical for most experiments: assuming a 50%
loss of PCR products during reaction puriﬁcation, 27 separate
PCR ampliﬁcation reactions would have to be combined for
samples with 10 ng of starting gDNA subjected to 15 cycles
of PCR ampliﬁcation (see Supplementary Fig. S6).

Overall, when assuming maximum sample-wide PCR ampliﬁ-
cation rate of 1.75, the optimal conditions for PCR ampliﬁcation
of complex 16S rDNA samples included a combination of smaller
amount of starting gDNA (<50ng) and moderate number of PCR
ampliﬁcation cycles (15—20 cycles). The use of a higher number of
PCR ampliﬁcation cycles should be avoided (Kanagawa, 2003). The
particular optimal values for starting gDNA amount and the number
of ampliﬁcation cycles will be affected by the speciﬁc microbial
community under investigation and the details of the experimental
protocol. The developed model is well suited to provide these
optimal condition estimates for different experimental setups. Our
model predicts that combination of 50 ng starting material and
18—20 cycles of PCR ampliﬁcation will require pooling of between
5 and 8 independent PCRs (assuming 1500 ng microarray load),
which is of reasonable cost and labor-wise. An additional advantage
of pooling multiple independent PCR ampliﬁcations of the same
sample is the mitigation of potential measurement biases associated
with PCR drift (Polz and Cavanaugh, 1998; Wagner et a1., 1994).
Our experimental PCR ampliﬁcation and puriﬁcation tests [data not
shown and Paliy et a1. (2009); Rigsbee et a1. (2011)] are consistent
with these predictions.

In summary, this work develops a mathematical model which
can assist with establishing the optimal experimental conditions for
the selective ampliﬁcation and microarray-based measurements of
community 16S rDNA. The developed model can be easily modiﬁed
to simulate the interrogation of other microbial communities as well
as other microarray designs or PCR ampliﬁcation protocols. For
example, to simulate different microbial communities the number
of species and their expected abundance distribution in the sample
can be modiﬁed (Fig. 2G). On the other hand, microarray detection
limit and the number of interrogating probesets can also be changed
to simulate a different microarray design. Furthermore, the model
can be ﬁirther expanded to include additional parameters inﬂuencing
microarray detection such as cross-hybridization behavior among
different probes and 16S rDNA fragments (Rigsbee et a1., 2011).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Template-based prediction of DNA binding proteins
requires not only structural similarity between target and template
structures but also prediction of binding affinity between the target
and DNA to ensure binding. Here, we propose to predict protein—
DNA binding affinity by introducing a new volume-fraction correction
to a statistical energy function based on a distance-scaled, finite,
ideal-gas reference (DFIRE) state.

Results: We showed that this energy function together with the
structural alignment program TM-align achieves the Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.76 with an accuracy of 98%, a
precision of 93% and a sensitivity of 64%, for predicting DNA binding
proteins in a benchmark of 179 DNA binding proteins and 3797 non-
binding proteins. The MCC value is substantially higher than the
best MCC value of 0.69 given by previous methods. Application of
this method to 2235 structural genomics targets uncovered 37 as
DNA binding proteins, 27 (73%) of which are putatively DNA binding
and only 1 protein whose annotated functions do not contain DNA
binding, while the remaining proteins have unknown function. The
method provides a highly accurate and sensitive technique for
structure-based prediction of DNA binding proteins.

Availability: The method is implemented as a part of the Structure-
based function-Prediction On-line Tools (SPOT) package available at

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA binding proteins are proteins that make speciﬁc binding
to either single or double-stranded DNA. They play an essential
role in transcription regulation, replication, packaging, repair and
rearrangement. With completion of many genome projects and many
more in progress, more and more proteins are discovered with
unknown function (J aroszewski et al., 2009). The structures for some
of those function-unknown proteins are solved because of structural

genomics projects (Burley, 2000). Functional annotations of these
proteins are particularly challenging because the goal of structural
genomics is to cover the sequence space of proteins so that homology
modeling becomes a reliable tool for structure prediction of any
proteins and, thus, many targets in structural genomics have low
sequence identity to the proteins with known function. Therefore, it
is necessary to develop computational tools that utilize not only
sequence but also structural information for function prediction
(Ahmad et al., 2004; Gao and Skolnick, 2008; Lee et al., 2007a;
Punta and Ofran, 2008; Sadowski and Jones, 2009; Watson et al.,
2005).

Many methods have been developed for structure-based
prediction of DNA binding proteins. These include function
prediction through homology and structural comparisons (Bhardwaj
et al., 2005; Ferrer-Costa et a1. , 2005a, b; Lee et al., 2007b; Pazos and
Sternberg, 2004; Shanahan et al., 2004). Others explore sequence
and structural features of DNA binding and non-binding proteins
with sophisticated machine learning methods such as neural network
(Ahmad et al., 2004; Mahony et al., 2006; Stawiski et al., 2003;
Tjong and Zhou, 2007), logistic regression (Lee et al., 2006) and
support vector machines (Bhardwaj et al., 2005; Cai and Lin, 2003;
Kumar et al., 2008; Langlois et al., 2007; Tjong and Zhou, 2007).

Recently, Gao and Skolnick (2008) proposed a new two-
step approach, called DBD-Hunter (Gao and Skolnick, 2008),
for structure-based prediction of DNA binding proteins. In
DBD-Hunter, the structure of a target protein is ﬁrst structurally
aligned to known protein—DNA complexes and the aligned complex
structures are used to build the complex structures between DNA
and the target protein. The predicted complex structures are, then,
employed for judging DNA binding or not by structural similarity
scores (TM-Score) and predicted protein—DNA binding afﬁnities.
TM-align (Zhang et al., 2005) and a contact-based statistical energy
function are employed in the ﬁrst and second steps of DBD-Hunter,
respectively. DBD-Hunter is found to substantially improve over
the methods based on sequence comparison only (PSI-BLAST),
structural alignment only (TM-align) and a logistic regression
technique (Szilagyi and Skolnick, 2006).

In this study, we investigate if one can ﬁirther improve the
prediction of DNA binding proteins by employing a different
statistical energy function for predicting binding afﬁnity. Our
knowledge-based energy function is distance-dependent and built on
a distance-scaled, ﬁnite, ideal gas reference (DFIRE) state originally

developed for proteins (Yang and Zhou, 2008a, b; Zhou and Zhou,
2002) and extended to protein—DNA interactions (Xu et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2005). Here, we introduce a new volume-fraction
correction for the DFIRE energy function in extracting protein—DNA
statistical energy ﬁinction from protein—DNA complex structures.
This volume fraction correction term, unlike previously introduced
one (Xu et al., 2009), is atom-type dependent to better account for
the fact that protein and DNA atom types are unmixable and occupy
in physically separated volumes. In addition to introduction of a new
energy function, we ﬁirther optimize protein—DNA binding afﬁnity
by performing DNA mutation. These two techniques lead to a highly
accurate and sensitive tool for structure-based prediction of DNA
binding proteins.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets

We employed the datasets compiled by Gao and Skolnick (2008). One
positive and one negative datasets for training are 179 DNA binding proteins
(DB179) and 3797 non-DNA binding proteins (NB3797). respectively. These
structures were obtained based on 35% sequence identity cutoff. a resolution
of 3 A or better. a minimum length of 40 residues for proteins. 6 bp for DNA
and 5 residues interacting with DNA (within 4.5 A of the DNA molecule). As
in Gao and Skolnick (2008). we use signiﬁcantly larger number of non-DNA
binding proteins in order to reduce false positive rate because DNA binding
proteins are only a small fraction of all proteins. APO and HOLO testing
datasets are made up of 104 DNA binding proteins whose structures are
determined in the absence and presence of DNA. respectively. A maximum
of 35% sequence identity was also employed in selecting these 104 proteins.
For APO/HOLO datasets. 93 AP07DB 179 pairs and 92 HOL07DB 179 pairs
have sequence identity >35%. These pairs are excluded from targetitemplate
pairs during testing. An additional test set of 1697 proteins (the SG1697 set)
was compiled from structural genome targets with a sequence identity cutoff
at 90% by Gao and Skolnick (2008) from the January 2008 PDB release.
We further updated the release on November 2009 and obtained 2235 chains
(the SG2235 set). This was done by queried ‘structural genomic” words in
the PDB databank. resulting in 2447 PDB entries. These PDB entries were
divided into protein chains and clustered by the CD-HIT (Li and Godzik.
2006). For the clusters that contain a protein chain in SG1679. we chose the
protein chain as the representation. For other clusters. we randomly chose one
protein chain. There are 538 additional proteins and a total of 2235 protein
chains.

To provide an additional test set and examine the effect of a larger database
of DNA binding proteins. we have also updated DNA binding proteins
from DB179 to DB250. This updated dataset of DNA binding proteins is
selected from PDB released on December 2009 based on the same criteria
that produced DB179. After removing the chains with high sequence identity
(>35%) with any chain contained in DB 179 and with each other. we obtained
71 additional proteiniDNA complexes. This leads to an additional test dataset
DB71 and an expanded training set DB250 (DB179 + DB7l).

2.2 Knowledge-based energy function

We employ a knowledge-based energy function to predict the binding afﬁnity
of a proteiniDNA complex. We have developed a knowledge-based energy
function for proteins based on the DFIRE that satisﬁes the following equation
(Zhou and Zhou. 2002):

 

N .(i,j,r)
—RTln °b“ ,_ , r<r\ [,
5331mm: (ﬁw ﬁg“, women“) ‘” (1)
0w rZrcutv

where R is the gas constant. T = 300 K. or = 1.61. Nobs(i,j, r) is the number of
ij pairs within the spherical shell at distance r observed in a given structure

database. ram is the cutoff distance. Arm is the bin width at rem. The value of
or(1.61) was determined by the best ﬁt of r0t to the actual distance-dependent
number of ideal-gas points in ﬁnite protein-size spheres.

Equation (1) for proteins was initially applied to proteiniDNA interactions
unmodiﬁed with 19 atom types for both proteins and DNA (DDNA; Zhang
et al.. 2005). In DDNA2 (Xu et al.. 2009). a low count correction is made

In addition. we employed residue/base- speciﬁc atom types with a distance-

This volume fraction correction was made to take into account the fact
that DNA and protein atoms with residue/base-speciﬁc atom types do
not mix with each other. However. we found that DDNA2 is unable
to go beyond existing techniques for predicting DNA binding proteins.
To further improve DDNA2. we introduce atom-type-dependent volume

set the factor 17 arbitrarily to 0.01 to control the magnitude of the energy
score. For convenience. we shall label the volume-fraction corrected DFIRE
as DDNA3.

2.3 Training of the method for predicting DNA binding
proteins

DB179 is used to generate the DDNA3 statistical energy function
[Equation (3)]. To avoid overﬁtting. we employed the leave-one-out scheme
to train DDNA3 statistical energy function. A target protein is chosen from
DB179/NB3797. The TM-align program is employed to make a structural
alignment between this target protein with a protein in DB179 (except itself
if it is in DB179). If the alignment score (TM-score) is greater than a
threshold. the proposed complex structure between the target protein and
DNA is obtained by replacing the template protein from its proteiniDNA
complex structure. The binding afﬁnity between DNA and the target protein
is evaluated by the DDNA3 energy function [Equation (3)]. Instead of
using template DNA sequences. we perform exhaustive mutations of DNA
base pairs to search for the highest binding afﬁnity. DNA bases are paired
by X3DNA software package (Lu and Olson. 2003). Unlike mutations in
proteins. DNA mutation is relatively easy because the dihedral angles of
bases are unchanged. The conformations of mutated bases are built using
default bond length. bond angle and dihedral angle parameters as deﬁned
in AMBER98 force ﬁeld (Cheatham et al.. 1999). A DNA base. if it does
not have a corresponding pairing base. is not mutated. If the highest binding
afﬁnity is greater than an optimized threshold. the target protein is considered
as a DNA binding protein. The method described above has two important
differences from DBD-hunter: the use of our distance-dependent energy
function and the search for the strongest binding DNA fragment.

2.4 Evaluation of the method for predicting DNA
binding proteins

The measures of the method performance are: sensitivity [SN =

TP/(TP + FN)l; Speciﬁcity [SP = TN/(TN + FP)]; accuracy [AC =

(TP + TN)/(TP + FN + TN + FP)]; and precision [PR = TP/(TP + FP)].

In addition. we employed a Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC)

TP>I<TN—FP>I<FN

MCC =
\/(TP+FN)(TP+FP)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)

Here. TP. TN. FP and FN refer to true positives. true negatives. false positives
and false negatives. respectively.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Training based on DB179/NB3797 (DDNA3)

We have optimized volume-fraction exponent f3, TM-score and
binding afﬁnity thresholds to achieve the highest MCC values.
Optimization is performed by a grid-based search. The grids for £3
and TM-score are 0.02 and 0.01, respectively. For the binding afﬁnity
threshold, the lowest energy of each aligned complex under different
TM-score thresholds is calculated and these energy values are
considered sequentially as the energy threshold. We found that the
highest MCC is 0.73 for £3 = 0.4, the structural similarity threshold of
0.60 and the energy threshold of —11.6. The corresponding accuracy,
precision and sensitivity are 98%, 91% and 60%, respectively.
The effect of a knowledge-based energy ﬁinction can be revealed
by replacing DDNA3 with DDNA2. The optimized MCC value
(structural similarity threshold of 0.53 and energy threshold of
—4.2) is 0.61. (Note, there is no f3 parameter in DDNA2.) The
corresponding accuracy, precision and sensitivity are 97%, 85% and
55%, respectively. It is clear that the reference state of a statistical
energy function has a signiﬁcant impact on the performance in
predicting DNA binding proteins. The largest improvement is 6%
improvement in precision, the fraction of correct prediction in
all prediction. The overall performance of DDNA3 signiﬁcantly
improves over that of DBD-Hunter, which has an MCC of 0.64,
98% accuracy, 84% precision and 55% sensitivity, respectively.

Figure 1 shows sensitivity as a function of false positive rate.
Our results were obtained by ﬁxing structural similarity threshold
and varying the energy threshold. It is clear that DDNA3 yields a
substantially higher sensitivity than either DDNA2 or DBD-Hunter
for a given false positive rate.

The predicted binding complexes can be employed to examine
predicted DNA binding residues. An amino acid residue is
considered as a DNA binding residue, if any heavy atom of that
residue is <4.5A away from any heavy atom of a DNA base.
Predicted binding residues from template-based modeling can be
compared to actual binding residues. For the training set (179 DB
and 3797 NB proteins), there are 108 predicted DB proteins with
11 false positives. For these 108 predicted complexes, speciﬁcity,
accuracy, precision, sensitivity and MCC of predicting DNA binding
residues are 94%, 89%, 74%, 68% and 0.64, respectively. For
a comparison, DDNA2 has predicted 99 DB proteins and the
corresponding performance in predicting DNA binding residues are
93%, 88%, 75%, 67% and 0.63, respectively. These performances
are similar to a speciﬁcity of 93%, an accuracy of 90%, a precision
of 71% and a sensitivity of 72% achieved by DBD-hunter. Similar
performance in predicting DNA binding residues is due to the same
structural alignment (TM-align) method used in the ﬁrst step by

three methods. The slight difference in binding residue prediction
is caused by two reasons: the change in the number of predicted
DNA binding proteins and possibly different templates recognized
by different methods.

3.2 TM-score-dependent energy threshold (DDNA30)

Obviously, one threshold for energy and one for structural similarity
(TM-score) are too simple to capture the complex relation between
structure and binding afﬁnity. For example, one expects that the
binding-energy requirement should be stronger for less similar
structures but weaker for highly similar structures between template
and query. This has led Gao and Skolnick (2008) to develop
TM-score-dependent energy thresholds (nine energy thresholds for
nine TM-score bins ranging from 0.40 to 1.0 to maximize MCC
value in each bin), and they ﬁnally set a minimum TM-score cutoff
at 0.55 for achieving the maximum MCC value. If we followed
their method, we found the same minimum TM-score cutoff at
0.55 for the maximum MCC value of 0.76. We revise this method
slightly here. Instead of optimizing the MCC for each TM-score
bin, we search for the energy threshold for a given TM-score bin
by optimizing the MCC value for the TM-score bin plus all other
bins with higher TM-scores. The results are shown in Table 1.
This revised method leads to the same maximum MCC value
of 0.76 but with a minimum TM-score cutoff at 0.52, slightly
increased sensitivity (two additional true positives) without increase
of false positives. To distinguish this ﬁirther optimized method, we
labeled it as DDNA30. DDNA3O yields a sensitivity of 64% and
speciﬁcity of 99.8%. By comparison, the corresponding optimized

DBD-Hunter with the same dataset has a MCC value of 0.69 with
the corresponding sensitivity of 58% and speciﬁcity of 99.5%, while
the DDNA3 has a MCC value of 0.73 with sensitivity of 60% and
speciﬁcity of 99.7%. Thus, the most signiﬁcant improvement from
DDNA3 to DDNA3O is signiﬁcant increase in sensitivity (from 60%
to 64%) also with slight reduction in rate of false positives (from
11/3797 t0 8/3797).

There are 114 complexes predicted as DNA binding proteins
by DDNA30. For these 114 complexes, predicted DNA binding
residues are compared to native complexes. The speciﬁcity,
accuracy, precision, sensitivity and MCC are 95%, 90%, 77%, 69%
and 0.67, respectively.

3.3 Test on the AP0104/HOL0104 datasets

The methods trained above (DDNA3 and DDNA30) are applied
to predict DNA binding proteins of AP0104/HOL0104 datasets.
The numbers of positive prediction are 50 by DDNA3 and 53 by
DDNA3O (out of 104) for the APO sets, and 61 by DDNA3 and
62 by DDNA3O (out of 104) for the HOLO sets, respectively. That
is, using monomer structures, rather than the complex structures,
leads to a reduction of 11% in sensitivity (from 59% for the HOLO
to 48% for the APO set) by DDNA3 and 9% by DDNA3O (from
60% to 51%). The corresponding sensitivity values for DDNA2 are
43.3% (45/104) and 53.8% (56/104) for the APO and HOLO sets,
respectively. The performance of DBD-Hunter (47% for the APO
and 55% for the HOLO sets) is somewhat in between DDNA2 and
DDNA3. The test conﬁrms an increase in sensitivity by DDNA3O
over by DDNA3 for the APO set, in particular.

A more detailed analysis on predictions made by DDNA3O shows
that there is an overlap of 50 predictions between the APO and
HOLO sets. Figure 2 shows one example of the test on target
proteins 1mjkA (contained in AP0104) and 1mij (contained in
HOL0104). 1mjkA and 1mij are the structures of the same
methionine repressor protein in the absence and presence of DNA
fragment, respectively. There is a small conformational change
before and after DNA binding (TM-score between the two is 0.93).
This small conformational change apparently does not prohibit the
successful match to the same template protein 1ea4A with strong
binding afﬁnity.

On the other hand, there are 12 correctly predicted HOLO
targets but incorrectly predicted APO targets as shown in Table 2.

Fig. 2. (3) Structural comparison between APO target protein 1mjkA (green)
and template protein 1ea4A (red). The TM-score between them is 0.79 and the
interaction energy between 1mjkA and template DNA is —20.9. (b) Structural
comparison between HOLO target protein 1mij (green) and template
protein (1ea4A). The TM-score between them is 0.76 and the interaction
energy between 1mij and template DNA is —20.6.

The difference is caused by signiﬁcant local conformational change
in binding regions (high TM-align score but low binding afﬁnity).
An example (11e8A in HOLO and corresponding 1f43A in APO)
is shown in Figure 3a, where signiﬁcant change in binding regions
(from red in APO to green in HOLO) leads to incorrect prediction
despite insigniﬁcant structural change in non-binding regions of the
protein. In another more extreme case (Fig. 3b), disordered region in
APO structure (1 j yfA) changes to ordered binding domain in HOLO
structure (lefaA).

Another cause of incorrect prediction in APO and correct
prediction in HOLO is large overall structural change. The large
overall structural changes lead to poor structural alignment to
templates so that their TM-scores are lower than the threshold.
For example, despite 90% sequence identity, TM-score between
1q39A in APO and 1k3w in HOLO structures is only 0.55 and
leads to the poor alignment of APO structure to template (best is
0.48 in TM-score). We also discovered a technical reason for an
APO target (1rxr_). We are unable to use the template employed
for the corresponding HOLO target because the sequence identity
between the template and its respective APO target is slightly higher
than 35%.

There are also three targets identiﬁed as DNA binding proteins
correctly in the APO set but not in the HOLO set. All three (llle,
1bf5A and 1esgA) are just outside of arbitrary boundaries generated
by optimization. This highlights the empirical nature of the proposed
approach.

3.4 Test on the DB71 dataset

The additional 71 proteins contained in the updated protein/DNA
complex structural dataset (DB71) offer a challenging test set.
DDNA3 (DDNA30) predicts 34 (39) out of 71 proteins as DNA
binding proteins. Thus, the sensitivity is 34/71 (48%) by DDNA3
and 55% by DDNA30. DDNA3O continues to make signiﬁcant
improvement in sensitivity over DDNA3. This 55% sensitivity is
5% lower than the sensitivity of 60% for the HOLO dataset but is
higher than the sensitivity of 5 1% for the APO dataset. This suggests
that >50% new complex structures are recognizable by DDNA3O

3.5 The effect of a larger, updated dataset of DNA
binding proteins (DDNA3U)

To examine the effect of a larger dataset of DNA binding proteins,
we use DB250 and NB3797 as the training set. We found that for
this larger, updated dataset, the highest MCC is 0.75 with the same
or similar values for three parameters (5 =0.4, TM-score threshold
of 0.55 and energy threshold of —13.7) as DDNA3. This result
highlights the stability of trained parameters with a 40% increase
in DNA binding proteins. The corresponding accuracy, precision
and sensitivity are 97%, 87% and 67%, respectively. In particular,
45 out of 71 additional proteins outside DB179 are recognized as

DNA binding by DB250-trained DDNA3 (DDNA3U), compared to
34 by DB 179-trained DDNA3. However, the sensitivity increases at
the cost of more false positives (26, more than doubled from 11 for
DB 179-trained DDNA3).

Application of this newly trained method to AP0104 and
HOL0104 sets leads to 52 (50%) and 64 (62%) predicted DNA
binding proteins, respectively. That is, a 40% expansion of DNA
binding proteins (from 179 to 250) leads to about 3% improvement
in sensitivity. However, as Figure 1 indicates, newly trained DDNA3
(labeled as DDNA3U) yields higher sensitivity only when false
positive rate >0.005. That is, at a lower false positive rate, a larger
template database in fact decreases sensitivity and precision.

One can employ TM-score-dependent energy thresholds to
the updated DB250/NB3797 databases. The resulting DDNA3UO
further increases the number of true positives from 167 to 176 but
the number of false positives also increases from 26 to 34. Since
we are interested in predicting DNA binding proteins with very low
false positive rate (<0.005), we will employ the methods (DDNA3
and DDNA30) trained by DB 179 to structural genomics targets.

To further examine the possibility of overﬁtting in DDNA3U,
we perform a 10-fold cross-validation tests on the DB250/NB3797.
That is, all the binding and non-binding sets are randomly divided
into 10 folds. Each time, one fold is chosen as the test set while the
other nine folds are employed for all training including the statistics
of potential energy function, the structure templates for protein—
DNA binding, and re-training of the threshold parameters. The test is
repeated for 10 times. The method performance is analyzed by 1000
times of bootstrap resampling (Angarica et al., 2008). We found that
the average MCC value is 0.70:I:0.02 with the accuracy of 97%,
the precision of 88% and the sensitivity of 58%, respectively. It is
clear that the only signiﬁcant change from the leave-one-out results
is the reduction of sensitivity from 67% to 58%. This is likely caused
by the reduced number of templates in the 10-fold cross-validation.
Indeed, if 249 templates are permitted to use, the average MCC

value is 0.72:I:0.02. Thus, our results are reasonably robust with
different training.

3.6 Application to structural genomics targets

As shown in Table 3, application of DDNA3 leads to 32 DNA
binding proteins from SG1697. Among them, 19 out of 32 proteins
(59%) are putative DNA binding proteins, 3 out of 32 proteins
(10%) are annotated to having other functions, while others (31%)
have unknown function. DDNA3O decreases the prediction of DNA
binding proteins from 32 to 27 without change on the number of
putative DNA binding proteins (19) but reduces the number of
proteins with other annotated ﬁ1nction from 3 to 1 and with unknown
ﬁinctions from 10 to 7. This result further conﬁrms the improvement
of DDNA3O over DDNA3. By comparison, DBD-Hunter predicts
37 DNA binding proteins. Among the 37 proteins, there are 18
(48.6%) putative DNA binding proteins, 3 (8.1%) with other putative
ﬁinctions and 16 (43.2%) with unknown function. All the putative
ﬁinctions are from the annotations in the NCBI database.

The overlap between predicted proteins by DDNA3O and DBD-
Hunter is only 19 proteins, 15 (79%) of which are putative
DNA binding proteins. The large fraction of putative DNA
binding proteins in overlapped predictions highlights signiﬁcant
improvement in conﬁdence of prediction when a consensus
prediction is made. Meanwhile, only 70% (19/27) proteins predicted
by DDNA3O overlap with those by DBD-Hunter highlights that the
energy ﬁinction plays a signiﬁcant role in prediction. There are four
putative DNA binding proteins (1ug2A, 1y9bA, 2cqu and 2fb1A)
predicted by DDNA3O but missed by DBD-Hunter. Similarly, there
are three putative DNA binding proteins (2hytA, 2iaiA and 2od5A)
predicted by DBD-Hunter but missed by DDNA30. The complete
list of predicted DNA binding proteins is shown in Table 4. Table 4
includes 10 additional predicted proteins from SG2235, 8 of which
are putative DNA binding proteins. That is, 73% (27/37) of predicted
proteins from SG2235 are putative DNA binding proteins. This result
conﬁrms the prediction quality of the proposed DDNA3O technique.

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed a highly accurate method (DDNA30) to predict
DNA binding proteins. This is accomplished by developing a new
statistical energy function for predicting DNA binding proteins.
We found that introducing an atom-type-dependent volume fraction
correction and DNA mutation in the DFIRE statistical energy
ﬁinction leads to a signiﬁcant improvement in the performance in
predicting DNA binding proteins (MCC = 0.76 for DB179/NB3797
by DDNA30). This is a signiﬁcant improvement from MCC of
0.69 given by optimized DBD-Hunter. Application of DDNA3O

to structural genome targets conﬁrms the accuracy of the proposed
method with 73% potentially correct prediction of DNA binding
proteins (annotated as putative DNA binding), 3% potentially false
positives (function annotated but not DNA binding) and the rest
unknown.

For DDNA3, the effect of DNA mutation is small for improving
the MCC value of the training set (from 0.72 to 0.73) but is
signiﬁcant for improving the sensitivity from 46/104 (44%) to
50/104 (48%) of the APO test set. We further ﬁnd that the
mutation leads to no signiﬁcant improvement in sequence identity
between template DNA sequence and wild-type DNA sequence. The
sequence identities to wild-type DNA sequences before and after
mutation are both close to the random value of 25%. One possible
reason is the absence of structural reﬁnement for protein during

mutation. This result also suggests that DDNA3 is not yet speciﬁc
enough to identify binding DNA bases.

In principle, exhaustive mutations of DNA base pairs can lead
to signiﬁcant increase in computing time for a long DNA segment.
However, because our energy ﬁ1nction does not consider base—base
interaction by assuming a rigid DNA structure before and after
binding, the computing requirement for the exhaustive mutations
of DNA base pairs is only four times more than that without base
mutations.

One potential concern is insufﬁcient statistics due to the small
number of complex structures for deriving the DDNA3 energy
function. We have addressed this question by employing the leave-
one-out (for both DB179 and DB250 sets) and 10-fold cross-
validation (for the DB250 set) techniques. The consistency between
different training and test sets provides the conﬁdence about the
energy functions obtained.

Another concern is potential overﬁtting due to ﬁve threshold
parameters in DDNA3O because of the small number of true
positives for each TM-score bins (Table 1). This concern is reduced
somewhat as the energy threshold mostly satisﬁes the expectation
that less similar structures (low TM-scores) requires stricter
energy thresholds. Moreover, there is a consistent improvement
in sensitivity from training (DB179) to test (APO/HOL0104,
DB71 and structural genomics targets). This consistency makes
the improvement statistically signiﬁcant. However, one certainly
cannot completely rule out overﬁtting. More studies as larger dataset
becomes available are certainly needed.

One advantage of the proposed structure-based prediction method
is the prediction of protein—DNA complex structures. The predicted
complex structures allow prediction of DNA binding residues. High
speciﬁcity and accuracy (>90%) are achieved for binding residue
prediction even for the APO structures (protein structures in the
absence of DNA).

The success of DDNA3O is limited by the availability of
protein—DNA complexes as templates. A40% expansion of template
databases from 179 to 250 proteins leads to signiﬁcant improvement
in sensitivity if false positive rate >0.005 (Fig. 1) but also slightly
decreases sensitivity if false positive rate <0.005. Thus, there is a
clear need to ﬁirther improve the energy ﬁ1nction that discriminates
binding from non-binding proteins. The rigid-body approximation
employed here likely has limited the performance of DDNA30.
Introducing ﬂexibility to DNA and proteins to DDNA3 is in
progress.

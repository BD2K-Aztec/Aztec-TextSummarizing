result is contrary to what is of fundamental biological interest. In
most studies of gene expression, the genes of highest interest are
those with large relative differences. The relative difference, or
fold change, is a basic and widely used measure for identifying
differential gene expression. Unfortunately, the raw fold change
is unreliable because it does not take into account the uncertainty
of gene expression measures under the two conditions being
compared. In particular, the fold changes of genes with low
read counts are less reliable than those of genes with high read
counts. In other words, fold changes based on read counts are
not comparable for genes with different expression levels or
genes of different lengths. In microarray analysis, a well—known
variance stabilization method is fold change with offset
(or start—log) (Durbin et al., 2002; Ritchie et al., 2007; Rocke
and Durbin, 2003), which adds an offset before calculating
fold changes. Researchers have also attempted to combine the
fold change and P—value to provide more meaningful results by
setting cutoffs for both the fold change and P—value as in the
well—known volcano plot (Cui and Churchill, 2003). However,
such an ad hoc technique does not result in meaningful gene
rankings.

Although sequencing costs are rapidly decreasing, experimen—
talists are reluctant to sequence replicate RNA samples without
pilot data that demonstrate the utility of the study. By comparing
single RNA—seq treatment samples from control conditions,
experimentalists can obtain valuable information that allows
them to adjust the experimental plan before scaling up to include
multiple replicates. That may partially explain why almost 70%
of all the human RNA—seq samples in the gene expression omni—
bus (Barrett et al., 2011) do not have biological replicates and
more un—replicated RNA—seq data were published than repli—
cated RNA—seq data in 2011 (Supplementary Fig. Sl). Despite
the importance of single replicate studies, there is currently no
satisfactory method for detecting differentially expressed genes
when only a single biological replicate is available.

In this article, we describe a technique for estimating fold
change that takes into account the uncertainty of gene expression
measurement by RNA—seq. We argue that this new measure of
fold change is more informative for the biology of a perturbed
system than either P—values or raw fold change especially for
single biological replicate experiments. From a Bayesian perspec—
tive, our representation of fold change is derived from the pos—
terior distribution of the raw fold change. This representation,
denoted as GFOLD, balances the estimated degree of change
with the signiﬁcance of this change. GFOLD is more reliable
than raw fold change for estimating the relative difference of
gene expression and facilitates the comparison of genes with dif—
ferent expression levels or of different lengths.

To validate its effectiveness, we applied GFOLD to several
datasets with biological replicates and compared it with edgeR,
DESeq, DEGseq, Poisson, Cufﬂinks and fold change with offset.
By comparing the results of different methods when biological
replicates are not available with the results when biological rep—
licates are available, we were be able to estimate the performance
of different methods using information from single replicates.
We also explored the biological signiﬁcance of gene rankings
produced using different methods. Comparisons show that
GFOLD outperforms all other methods in most cases when
there is only a single replicate. We built a hierarchical model

for cases in which biological replicates are available. In such
cases, GFOLD provides comparable results to existing methods.

2 METHODS

We describe the single-replicate model in the main text and leave the
multiple-replicate model in the supplementary. Because the technical vari-
ance of RNA-seq is negligible (Bullard et al., 2010), the read count of a
gene can be effectively modeled by the Poisson distribution (Jiang and
Wong, 2009). Speciﬁcally, the probability of observing k short reads
associated with a gene is as follows:

Ak 7A
P(k)=]e—',A=n><l><X (1)
C

where X is the expression level of this gene [(e.g. in RPKM (Reads Per
Kilo bases per Million reads) Mortazavi et al., 2008)], n is a normalization
constant reﬂecting the sequencing depth and l is the gene length. The
method proposed by Anders and Huber (Anders and Huber, 2010) was
used to calculate n. If this method fails, we simply treat n as the library
size (sequencing depth).

The observed read count k is based on the expression level X, which is
actually what we want to measure. From a Bayesian point of view, A and
therefore X can be treated as random variables, and the posterior distri-
bution of A is deﬁned by

k 7A
Post(A) oc A e
k!
which is a gamma distribution with shape k + l and scale 1. Here, the
uniform distribution is used as the prior for A.

For a gene, given the observed read counts under two conditions, the
posterior distribution of expression levels X1 and X2 under the two con-
ditions can be calculated as above. Furthermore, the posterior distribu-
tion of log2 fold change 10g2(X2/X1) can also be calculated. Note that the
calculation involves l, which can be avoided by calculating the posterior
distribution of y,» = l X X,»,i e {1, 2} and z = log2(yz/y1) instead. It is ob-
vious that log2(yz/y1) and 10g2(X2/X1) have the same distribution.

To utilize the variance information of the posterior distribution of fold
change, we deﬁne the generalized fold change of a gene as follows:

 

(2)

max(t,0)|PZ(z 5 t) = c, if mean(Z) Z 0

GFOLD(c) = { min“, 0)|PZ(Z Z t) = c, if mean(Z)<0 (3)

where P2 is the posterior distribution of z = log2(yz/y1) and c is a par-
ameter with default parameter 0.01. If the gene is up-regulated, i.e.
mean(Z) : 0, the probability of the log2 fold change (2nd/ 1st) being
larger than t is l — c. In this case, I is less than mean(Z) with default
value of c. GFOLD(c) takes maX(t, 0) to truncate negative I to zero. If
GFOLD(c) is 0, then the expression level of this gene does not show
signiﬁcant change. The case for mean(Z)<0 is symmetric to the case of
mean(Z) : 0. Genes can be ranked by their GFOLD values in descending
order such that top ranked ones are differentially up-regulated and
bottom ranked ones are differentially down-regulated.

Figure 1 shows examples of the posterior distributions of log2 fold
change and the calculated GFOLD values for three up-regulated genes.
The ﬁgure also compared the gene rankings based on the naive read
count fold change, GFOLD value and P-value for the three genes.
According to the P-value we would consider the black gene to be the
most signiﬁcant one, followed by green then red. The ranking of black
above green is problematic because the true fold change of the green gene
is very likely to be much greater than that of the black. If we used the
naive fold change to rank genes, green would be the most signiﬁcant one,
followed by red then black. Although the red gene has a greater naive fold
change than the black gene, the read counts for the red gene are low and
the estimate of fold change is unreliable. GFOLD strikes a balance be-
tween fold change and P-value, ranking green ﬁrst, followed by black and

Fig. 1. Rankings of example genes by GFOLD, fold change and P-value.
The ﬁgure illustrates the idea of GFOLD by comparing gene rankings
deﬁned by GFOLD (0.01), fold change and P-value on three example
genes. The read counts of the black, red and green genes are (1000, 2500),
(5, 20) and (50, 250) under two biological conditions with the same
sequencing depth, respectively. The three curves are the corresponding
posterior distributions of log fold change. ‘G’ stands for GFOLD value
and ‘p’ stands for P-value calculated using Poisson test

then red. GFOLD not only measures the fold change but also captures
the small variance of the posterior distribution of log2 fold change for the
highly expressed genes.

If the fold change based on the read count is ﬁxed and c < 0.5, then
GFOLD(c) penalizes genes with low expression levels because the pos-
terior distribution of the fold change from such genes has a large vari-
ance. This trend is clearly demonstrated in Figure 1. Setting 6 to a smaller
value shifts the preference from genes with higher fold changes at lower
expression values to genes with lower fold changes at higher expression
levels. By default, we set c = 0.01, which means that in 99% of cases, the
fold change of a gene is above the absolute GFOLD(0.01) value for this
gene.

To better understand the properties of the posterior distribution of
fold change and GFOLD, we compared several posterior distributions
of fold change with normal distributions in Supplementary Figure S2.
When read counts are high, the posterior distributions of fold change are
similar to normal distributions; but the similarity disappears when read
counts are low.

It might be possible to describe the posterior distribution of log2 fold
change with a closed-form formula based on the distribution of the ratio
of two gamma variables (Kwan and Leung, 2005). However, the close
form calculation is too time consuming to be practical because it involves
the inverse of the distribution function. Therefore, in this work, the cal-
culation is done by sampling. Speciﬁcally, we first sample
y,» = l X X,»,i e {1, 2} according to Equation (2), then estimate the poster-
ior distribution ofz = log(yz/y1) based on sampled values ofyl», i e {1, 2},
and last calculate GFOLD(c) according to Equation (3). The whole pro-
cess is very efﬁcient. For example, to calculate GFOLD values for all the
genes given a pair of samples used in this work, it costs less than 30 s on a
typical desktop PC.

3 APPLICATIONS
3.1 Datasets

We assessed the effectiveness of our approach on the following
ﬁve publicly available RNA—seq and GRO—seq datasets that

contain biological replicates. For each dataset, we merged tech—
nical replicates to form a single biological replicate. The five
datasets are as follows: human brain dataset downloaded from
DDBJ (Kaminuma et al., 2011) with accession number
SRA009447, mouse brain dataset (Polymenidou et al., 2011)
downloaded from DDBJ with accession number SRA030347,
Type I latency B—cell line dataset (Xu et al., 2010) downloaded
from DDBJ with accession number SRP001880, EN CODE data—
set (Birney et al., 2007) downloaded from UCSC Genome
Browser (Kent et al., 2002) and estrogen response dataset con—
taining GRO—seq data (Hah et al., 2011) and ERa—binding data
(W elboren et al., 2009). The detailed description of each dataset
is in the Supplementary Material.

3.2 Methods compared

In the following comparison, we compared GFOLD with the
following methods: edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010), DESeq
(Anders and Huber, 2010), Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2010),
DEGseq (Wang et al., 2010), Poisson test and fold change with
offset. Because GFOLD value depends on the cutoff c, we use
GFOLDX to denote GFOLD with c = X/1000 (i.e. GFOLD10
means cutoff 0.01). The method edgeR has an option of whether
to estimate the tag—wise dispersion. We denote the version of
edgeR that estimates tag—wise dispersion as edgeRT. For
DEGseq, there are two MA—based methods: MA—plot—based
method with Random Sampling model (MARS) and MA—plot—
based method with Technical Replicates (MATR). MARS deals
with replicates by summing up read counts for every gene and
then treating the data as if there were no replicates, whereas
MATR estimates the variance based on replicates. When repli—
cates were available we found the MATR results to be less ac—
curate than those produced by MARS (results now shown);
therefore, we used MARS method for DEGseq. Because
Poisson test (Poisson) is the simplest method considered for de—
tecting differentially expressed genes, it was included in the com—
parison. For fold change with offset, because the optimal offset is
unknown, we tried different offsets: 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and
60. Fold change with offset X is denoted as FCX.

3.3 MA plot comparisons

MA plot is a convenient way to display differentially expressed
genes. We applied MA plot to compare the results from nine
methods (GFOLDS, GFOLD10, FC20, Cufﬂinks edgeRT,
DESeq, edgeR, DEGseq and Poisson) on a pair of samples
(one control and one TDP—43 depleted sample) selected from
the mouse brain dataset.

Supplementary Figure S3 showed the distribution of the vari—
ance and signal strength for the top 1000 differentially expressed
genes identiﬁed by different methods. DEGseq and edgeR show
similar results as Poisson. They are biased towards genes with
larger read counts. Such a bias would cause less biological mean—
ingful results as shown in the following sections. GFOLDS,
GFOLD10, DESeq and FC20 show less bias.

Although all of the methods except for GFOLD and
FC20 adopt P—values for testing signiﬁcance, the P—values of
different methods are not comparable (as shown in
Supplementary Fig. S4). DESeq tends to overestimate the vari—
ance and, as a result, identiﬁes fewer differentially expressed

 

2784

GFOLD

 

genes using the same P—value cutoff. The high similarity between
Poisson, edgeR and DEGseq indicates that the later two meth—
ods essentially calculate the Poisson variance introduced by ran—
dom sampling in the sequencing step and thus omit biological
variance. Therefore, none of the nine methods properly estimate
the biological variance when no biological replicate is available.

3.4 Ranking comparisons

Although we do not know the true levels of gene expression
under different conditions, in theory, estimates of the gene
expression levels improve with the increase of replicate
number. We therefore can evaluate the performance of a
method on single replicate against a proxy for the truth in
which multiple biological replicates are used. As the different
statistics results from different algorithms are not directly com—
parable, we compared the rankings of the gene differential
expression statistics to evaluate the performance of the different
approaches while avoiding setting arbitrary cutoffs for different
methods.

Speciﬁcally, given two top N up—regulated (or N down—
regulated) gene rankings, we took the top k < N genes in each
ranking and then calculated the number of genes Ain common
(denoted as k) in the two top gene sets. Then, k/k, ranging
from 0 to 1, measured the similarity of the two top k genes.
After all ks were considered, we were able to draw a curve
with k/N as the X—axis and k/k as the y—axis. We further deﬁned
rank area as the area below the curve, similar to the calculation
of the area based on an ROC curve. If the rank curve reached the
top left corner of the plot, i.e. the rank area was 1, then the two
gene rankings were identical. The rank area is a direct measure of
the similarity of the two rankings. We set N = 1000 in the com—
parisons. Figure 2 illustrates an example that compares the re—
sults produced by DESeq on all replicates (as benchmark) with
the results by all methods on only a pair of single replicates on
Type I B—cell dataset. GFOLD in general gives the better overlap
with the benchmark, with the default GFOLD10 giving the best
results. Compared with FC, GFOLD is less sensitive to the par—
ameters as shown in Supplementary Figure S5.

Fig. 2. An example of the rank area comparison. The up-regulated gene
rankings of different methods on a sample pair are compared with the
gene ranking by DESeq given all replicates on the Type I B-cell dataset.
A curve that gives larger area under the curve is considered better

Of all the methods we compared, six (Cufﬂinks, GFOLD,
DEGseq, edgeR, DESeq and edgeRT) accepted replicates.
Theoretically, results produced by each of them on all replicates
could be used as benchmark, but we did not know which derived
benchmark was the most reliable one. Therefore, we compared
the results of each method on every possible pair of single rep—
licates with all derived benchmarks from six methods separately.
The comprehensive comparison on human brain datasets is given
in the heatmaps illustrated in Supplementary Figure S6. Except
for using DEGseq as benchmark, GFOLD in general performed
better than any given method even when the benchmark was
produced by that method. When the benchmark by DEGseq
was used, DEGseq, edgeR and Poisson gave better results than
GFOLD. We looked into details of the results and found that the
MARS method adopted by DEGseq summed up read counts
from replicates and behaved similar to Poisson and edgeR, as
shown in Supplementary Figure S3(GiI). Therefore, edgeR,
DEGseq and Poisson performed better when the benchmark
by DEGseq was used. Supplementary Figure S6 also shows
that the performance of FC10 was comparable to that of
GFOLD10. To better understand the difference between
GFOLD and fold change with offset, we further evaluated the
performance of different methods on other datasets. For each
method on each dataset, Table 1 shows the average rank area
which was calculated by averaging over all possible sample pairs,
all benchmarks and the up—/down—regulated gene lists. In the
table, methods are ranked by their average rank areas over all
datasets. For each dataset, fold change with the optimal offset
was comparable with GFOLD10. However, the optimal offset
for fold change varied for different datasets. For example, FC10
performed better than other offsets in the human brain and the
ENCODE dataset but not on the other three datasets.
Furthermore, the selection of the optimal offset for fold
change seems uncorrelated with the sequencing depth. To the
contrary, GFOLD with parameter 0.005 or the default param—
eter 0.01 performs well on all five datasets.

3.5 In—group and out-group comparisons

Given a dataset with biological replicates under two conditions,
an in—group comparison consists of all possible comparisons be—
tween two biological replicate samples. An out—group compari—
son consists of all possible comparisons between two samples
from different conditions. A commonly used strategy to assess
the speciﬁcity of a method is to do an in—group and out—group
comparison and to identify differentially expressed genes using
the same cutoff. If a method reports fewer differentially ex—
pressed genes in the in—group comparison but reports more dif—
ferentially expressed genes in the out—group comparison, then
such a method is considered to achieve better speciﬁcity.

In previous studies, the in—group and out—group comparisons
were conducted by setting a default cutoff for the P—value.
However, as we stated above, P—values used by different methods
are not comparable. Furthermore, GFOLD and fold change
with offset do not rank genes by P—values. To make a fair com—
parison of different methods using the in— and out—group com—
parisons, we adopted a strategy similar to the calculation of
FDR mentioned above. For a method generating a P—value,
we ﬁrst applied this method to all possible in— and out—group

comparisons and determined all of the P—values assigned to every
gene. Then, we drew a curve with the X—axis representing the
percentage of genes with P—values below a certain cutoff in the
in—group comparison and the y—axis representing the percentage
of genes with P—values below the same cutoff in the out—group
comparison. This approach was similar for GFOLD and fold
change with offset, except that we calculated the percentage of
genes with absolute fold changes or GFOLD values above cer—
tain cutoffs.

Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S7 represent the results
for the human brain dataset. The ﬁgures show that GFOLD
achieved the best speciﬁcity when a large GFOLD value
cutoff was used, which is a desired property because we are
more interested in these genes. Supplementary Figure S7
also shows that GFOLD is not sensitive to the parameter.
DEGseq, edgeR and Poisson produced similar curves, which is
consistent with the previous analysis that DEGseq and edgeR
give similar results with those by Poisson. Although fold change
with offset performed better than GFOLD on the Type I B—cell
dataset and edgeRT performed slightly better than GFOLD
on the estrogen response dataset, GFOLD generally performed
well and is not sensitive to the cutoff (as shown in Supplementary
Figure S8).

In general, the difference between two biological replicates is
expected to be smaller than that between two samples from dif—
ferent conditions. If the variance is not overestimated, as in the
Poisson model, under the same P—value cutoff, we expected to
observe more genes with more significant P—values when compar—
ing two samples from different conditions. The fact that the
curves for edgeR, DESeq and Cufﬂinks are close to the reverse
diagonal line indicates that under the same P—value cutoff the

three methods give similar number of differential genes for both
in— and out—group comparisons, demonstrating that edgeRT,
DESeq and Cufflinks overestimated the variance for out—group
comparison. Therefore, for those three methods, more stringent
cutoffs could be selected to identify more differently expressed
genes. In practical data analysis, the gene ranking is often of
greater importance that the P—values themselves; in many down—
stream data analyses, such as gene set enrichment analysis, a
ranking of genes is the only required input (Subramanian
et al., 2005).

3.6 The biological signiﬁcance of gene rankings
on ENCODE datasets

Although previous comparisons were concerned with consistency
within datasets these comparisons do not address the main
reason for using GFOLD that it provides a useful measure of
biologically relevant changes. This section focuses on the biolo—
gical signiﬁcance of gene rankings given by different methods
using the functional annotation service provided by DAVID
(Dennis et al., 2003).

We first checked the functional annotations produced by
DAVID given the top 1000 genes up—regulated in K562 using
all biological replicates in both K562 and GM12878 by six dif—
ferent methods. Generally, the top—ranked functional annota—
tions are very similar for results from GFOLD, DESeq, edgeR
and edgeRT both in ranking and signiﬁcance. Except for
DEGseq, the ﬁrst functional annotation clusters by the other
methods contain the same four Gene Ontology (GO) terms:
angiogenesis, vasculature development, blood vessel develop—
ment and blood vessel morphogenesis. For GFOLD, DESeq,
edgeR and edgeRT, the enrichment scores of this cluster are all
over 5 and the Benjamini P—values for every GO term are all
below 0.01. High enrichment of the angiogenesis related cluster is
an expected result, because increased angiogenesis is one of the
characteristics of chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line like
K562 (Vidovic et al., 2009; Zhelyazkova et al., 2008).

 

2786

ﬁm'spzumofpmJXO'sopeuHOJmorq/ﬁdnq

GFOLD

 

We then evaluated the performance of all methods on pairs of
single replicates. The top 1000 up—regulated genes produced by
each method were used to do functional annotation analysis as
above. We checked whether the angiogenesis—related set could be
identified with high signiﬁcance (enrichment scores >5 and
Benjamini value <0.01) by DAVID given the results from each
method. The DAVID results, summarized in Supplementary
Table S1, showed that only results produced by GFOLD5,
GFOLD10, GFOLD50, GFOLD100 and FC5 could pass the
test on both pairs of single replicates simultaneously.
Furthermore, in most of the cases, the angiogenesis—related set
is ranked top for GFOLD and fold change with offset.
Therefore, when only a single replicate is available, GFOLD
and fold change with offset could give more biological meaning—
ful gene rankings, and results by GFOLD were more stable and
less sensitive to the parameter than that by fold change with
offset.

We further redid the GO analysis using GOseq (Young et al.,
2010) to avoid possible bias due to over—detection of differential
expression for long and highly expressed transcripts. Similar to
the results of DAVID, the GOseq results, summarized in
Supplementary Tables S27S4, show that blood vessel develop—
ment and blood vessel morphogenesis are ranked top given the
gene lists produced by GFOLD, DESeq, edgeR, edgeRT and
Cufﬂinks when all biological replicates are used. When single
replicate is used, GFOLD, FC and Cufﬂinks give these two
GO terms much higher and more consistent ranks than the
other methods do, and GFOLD is less sensitive to the parameter
compared with FC.

3.7 The biological signiﬁcance of gene rankings on
estrogen response dataset

We further discuss the biological significance of gene rankings
based on the estrogen response dataset. Using the breast cancer
cell line MCF7, Hah et al. (2011) performed a GRO—seq experi—
ment that measures the rate of transcription, different from the
cellular concentration of mRNA that is measured by RNA—seq.
Comparing transcription rates before and after estrogen stimu—
lation, they found that genes with estrogen induced transcription
rates tended to have estrogen receptor (ER) binding sites near
their transcription start sites (TSSs). This is consistent with the
biological mechanism in which ER binding at enhancers interacts
with the transcriptional machinery at the TSS to induce tran—
scription. Gene rankings that have the largest proportion of
ER binding near the top of the list could be said to be of the
greatest biological relevance. In Supplementary Figure S9 (AiC),
we compare, as a function of ranking, the proportion of genes
having at least one ER binding site within 10 kb of the TSS.
Here, for a better visualization, we used the default cutoff for
GFOLD and selected 30 as the optimal offset for fold change
based on Table 1. When two biological replicates are used
[Supplementary Fig. S9 (A)], all methods achieve a similar per—
formance except for DEGseq. DESeq and ed geRT exhibit a clear
drop when the top 1007200 genes are considered. When a pair of
single replicates is used [Supplementary Fig. S9 (B and C)],
GFOLD10, FC30 and DESeq have similar behavior, clearly out—
performing the other methods.

4 DISCUSSION

An experiment with multiple treatment and control replicates
should be considered better designed and more informative
than one that has single treatment and control samples.
However, it is common for experimental groups to have biolo—
gical material that is sufﬁcient for only single replicate RNA—seq
experiments. The data from such experiments provide imperfect
information which is nevertheless far better than no information
at all. In many experimental settings when it is not clear which
downstream experiment is better, single replicate experiments are
efﬁcient for collecting useful knowledge that allows informed
decisions to be made. In this study, we have shown that
GFOLD provides a more consistent and more biologically
meaningful approach to ranking differentially expressed genes
than other commonly used methods for RNA—seq data without
biological replicates, Although raw fold change does not take the
variance of gene expression into account, and many P—value es—
timation methods rely too much on variance estimates, GFOLD
seeks a balance between estimates of expression change and vari—
ability. The GFOLD value for each gene can be considered as a
robust fold change, which measures primarily the relative change
of the expression level instead of the signiﬁcance (i.e. P—value) of
differential expression. The evaluation results conducted on real
datasets showed that in the analysis of a single pair of replicates,
the gene ranking by GFOLD is better than other methods in
terms of consistency with rankings based on multiple replicate
data. The results from the ENCODE and GRO—seq dataset sug—
gest that when using single replicate data the rankings produced
by GFOLD are more biologically meaningful than the gene
rankings by other methods. We stress that while useful informa—
tion can be obtained from single replicate experiments, an ana—
lysis of variation between samples is necessary to draw sound
conclusions, especially on the individual gene level.

In comparison with other methods, besides fold change with
offset, GFOLD is simple and intuitive. If there is no biological
replicate, GFOLD is based on only one assumption that the read
count of a gene follows a Poisson distribution. On the contrary,
P—value is likely to be inaccurate without reliable measurements
and modeling of gene expression variation because it is in the
tails of the null distribution. Even if the biological variance has
been captured accurately, P—values from other methods tell only
of whether a gene is differentially expressed and not directly of
the relative difference in expression. In comparison with
GFOLD, fold change with offset is even simpler and could
give comparable results if the optimal offset is selected; however,
it is hard to select the optimal offset. Furthermore, the optimal
offset seems uncorrelated with the sequencing depth. In contrast,
GFOLD with the default cutoff performed well on all ﬁve data—
sets we have tested.

GFOLD is generalizable to isoforrn—level analysis of differen—
tial expression. The main challenge is that a system of linear
equations has to be solved before calculating the posterior dis—
tribution of log fold change (Jiang and Wong, 2009), which is out
of scope of this study. In general, we believe that the ranking of
gene expression changes by GFOLD, using a reliable measure of
fold change, is more biologically meaningful than ranking by P—
value. This concept can be broadly applied, beyond RNA—seq or
GRO—seq, to other types of genomic data, including ChIP—seq.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Changes in the normal rhythm of a human heart may
result in different cardiac arrhythmias, which may be immediately
fatal or cause irreparable damage to the heart sustained over long
periods of time. Therefore, the ability to automatically identify arrhyth-
mias from ECG recordings is important for clinical diagnosis and treat-
ment. In this article, classification by using associative Petri net (APN)
for personalized ECG-arrhythmia-pattern identiﬁcation is proposed for
the first time in literature.

Results: A rule-based classification model and reasoning algorithm of
APN are created for ECG arrhythmias classification. The performance
evaluation using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database shows that our ap-
proach compares well with other reported studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart disease is an umbrella term for a number of different
diseases which affect the heart such as arrhythmia, myocardial
ischemia and myocardial infarction (Miniﬁo et al., 2007). As of
2007, it is also one of the leading causes of death in the world,
and especially according to the American Heart Association,
One American is dying in every 34s because of this disease
(American Heart Association, 2008). Changes in the normal
rhythm of a human heart may result in different cardiac arrhyth-
mias, which may be immediately fatal or cause irreparable
damage to the heart when sustained over long periods of time.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important routine clinical prac-
tice for continuous monitoring of cardiac activities. Since ECG
signals vary greatly for different individuals and within patient
groups (Hoekema et al., 2001), ECG-pattern recognition is a
difficult problem even with the aid of a computer. While
normal sinus rhythm originates from the sinus node of heart,
arrhythmias have various origins and indicate a wide variety of
heart problems. Same symptoms of arrhythmia produce different
morphologies due to their origins such as premature ventricular
contraction (Minami et al., 1999). For effective diagnostics, the
study of ECG pattern and heart-rate-variability signal may have
to be carried out over several hours. Thus, computer-based

analysis and classiﬁcation of diseases can be very helpful in diag-
nostics (Guler and Ubeyli, 2005; Saxena et al., 2002). A number
of methods have been proposed to classify ECG-heartbeat pat-
terns based on the features extracted from ECG signals. APNs
have knowledge representation ability and could be translated
into production rule systems. In addition, the APN formalism
also is a graphical and mathematical tool for design, specifica-
tion, simulation and verification of systems. Therefore, APN can
be widely used in computer, knowledge-based systems, process
control, decision making as well as other kinds of engineering
applications. In this article, classiﬁcation of ECG arrhythmias by
using associative Petri net (APN) is proposed for the first time in
the literature and is compared with several pioneering studies for
arrhythmias detection.

2 RELATED WORK

An ECG is a graphic produced by an electrocardiograph. A
single normal cycle of the ECG represents the successive arterial
depolarization and ventricular repolarization, and can be ap-
proximately associated with the peaks and other ECG wave-
forms, which labeled P, Q, R, S and T (McSharry et al., 2003).
Recently, different characteristic, such as P, T, U waves and PQ,
QRS, ST segments, are also used for diagnostics (Singh and
Tiwari, 2006). Automated classiﬁcation of heartbeats has been
previously reported by other investigators using a variety of fea-
tures to represent the ECG and a number of classiﬁcation meth-
ods. Features include RR-Interval features, heartbeat-interval
features and ECG-morphology features (Philip et al., 2004),
ST-segment deviation, -segment slope (STS), -segment area
(STA), T-normal amplitude (Exarchos et al., 2006), STA, RPS
interval (RSI), STS, RiT interval (RTI), QRS area (QRSA), Q
T interval (QTI), R-wave amplitude (RWA), heart-beat rate
(HBR), statistical features QRS energy (QRSE), mean of the
power spectral density (MPSD), auto-correlation coefficient
(ACC), signal histogram (SH) (Gholam et al., 2006), discrete
Fourier transform coefﬁcients (DFT) (Dokur and Glmez,
2001), statistical features of the QRS complexes (Osowski and

ant Weong et al., 2006), continuous wavelet transform coefﬁ-
cients (Andreao et al., 2006), QRS complex wave width

et al., 2013; Engin, 2004; Inan and Ubeyl, 2005). In addition, the
classiﬁcation of heartbeats employed include linear discriminants
(Philip et al., 2004), association rules (Exarchos et al., 2006),
neural network (1 Dokur and Olmez, 2001; Gholam et al.,

Recent studies developed new feature-extracted and classiﬁca-
tion methods to detect various heart-related diseases and other
complications by analyzing ECG characteristics. Ghaffari et a].
(2010) use two innovative modiﬁed Hilbert transform-based
algorithms to extracted QRS complexes and end-systolic end-
diastolic pulses for detecting acute hypotensive episodes and
mean arterial pressure dropping regimes. A new classiﬁcation
tree based on conditions combinations competition (T-3C) is
proposed for the accurate diagnosis of cardiac ischemia and
ﬁve measurements were considered in their study (Fayn, 2011).
Vullings et a]. (2011) use Bayesian framework to develop an
adaptive Kalman filter. The adaptive estimation of the process
and measurement noise covariance is performed by maximizing
the Bayesian evidence function of the sequential ECG estima-
tion. Sufi and Khalil (2011) use data mining techniques, to per-
form a real-time classiﬁcation of cardiovascular disease. Lin et a].
(2010) use Bayesian algorithm combined with a Markov chain
Monte Carlo method to detection and delineation of ECG
signals.

Recently, association rules have been utilized for the extrac-
tion of knowledge from medical history and for the analysis of
medical signals (Bourien et al., 2004; Konias and Maglaveras,
2004). An APN incorporated the concepts and operations of
association algorithm of Apriori [3] and can represent the asso-
ciative production rules of a rule-based system. Therefore, an
adoption of APNs (Shih et al., 2007) in reasoning and classiﬁ-
cation of ECG arrhythmias is straightforward in this article.

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS

This section is a brief description of methods used in this research such as
a statistical sampling method, membership function generation by
Minimize Entropy Principle Approach (MEPA) and reasoning process
of ECG signals by proposed APN.

3.1 Dataset

PhysioNet’s MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (PhysioBank, 2006) con-
tains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings,
obtained from 47 subjects (records 201 and 202 are from the same sub-
ject) studied by the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979.
Of these, 23 recordings were chosen at random from a collection of >4000
Holter tapes, and the other 25 recordings were selected to include ex-
amples of uncommon but clinically important arrhythmias that would
not be well represented in a small random sample.

These groups comprise men and women between the ages of 23 and 89,
and are analyzed by two independent cardiologists who use nomenclature
to classify them by the types of beats and rhythms. Our selected heartbeat
clusters are classiﬁed into the eleven heartbeat types including one normal
and various abnormal types as shown in Table 1.

3.2 MEPA

In this section, an MEPA is adopted to provide the persuasiveness of
determining the length of intervals and membership functions in heart-
beat patterns. Assume that a threshold value is sought for a sample in the
range between x1 and x2. An entropy equation with each value of x is
written for the regions [x], x1+x] and [x1+x, x2] which are deﬁned as
the ﬁrst region f and the second region g, respectively. Entropy with each
value of x in the region between x1 and x2 is expressed as (Christensen,
1980):

E(X) = ﬂX)E;(X) + g(X)Eg(X) (1)
Where
ENC) = -If1(x) + 111f1(x) +f2(x) + 111f2(x)] (2)
Eg(x) = —[g1(x) + 111 g1 (X) + g2 (X) + 111 g2 00] (3)
ﬁx) + g(x) = 1 (4)

and fk(x) and gk(x) are conditional probabilities that class k sample in the
region [x1, x1 + x] and [x1 + x, x2], respectively. A value of x that gives the
minimum entropy is the optimum threshold value. The value estimates of
fk(x) and gk(x), ﬁx) and g(x), are calculated as follows:

_ nk(x) + 1
fk(x) — m (5)
_ Nk(x) + 1
gk(x) — W (6)
ﬁx) = % (7)
g(x) = 1 -f(x) (8)

where

nk(x)=number of class k samples located in [xz, xz+x], n(x)=the
total number of samples located in [xz, xz+ x], Nk(x) = number of class
k samples located in [xz+x, x2], N(x)=the total number of samples
located in [x2 + x, x2], n = total number of samples in [x1, x2], 2: a general
length along the interval [x1, x2].

An APN model for Arrhythmic beat classification

 

While moving x in the region [x1, x2], we can determine the values of
entropy for each position of x, as in Figure 1. The value in the region that
holds the minimum entropy is called the primary threshold (PR1) value. If
we denote a secondary threshold in one area such as SEC] and the other
secondary threshold in another area will be SEC2. In order to develop
seven partitions, we need tertiary threshold values and denoted as TERl,
TER2, TER3 and TER4. The induction is performed by the entropy
minimization principle, which clusters most optimally the parameters
corresponding to the output classes (Ross, 2000). By minimizing the en-
tropy, we can ﬁnd intervals in which the distribution of samples of any
class is as relatively uniform as possible.

3.3 APN model

Classiﬁcation using APN was applied for the detection of arrhythmia
beats. APN is deﬁned as follows (Shih et al., 2007).

3 .3 .1 Deﬁnition of APN An APN is a directed graph, which contains
three types of nodes: places, squares and transitions. Where circles rep-
resent places, squares represent thresholds of association degree and bars
represent transitions. Each place may contain a token associated with a
truth-value between zero and one. Each transition is associated with a
certainty factor (CF) value between zero and one. Directed arcs represent
the relationships between places. A generalized APN structure can be
deﬁned as a 13-tuple and the APN can be mathematically and graphically
illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.

Let A be a set of directed arcs. If pje I(t,-), then there exists a directed
arc aﬂ, aﬂe A, from the place [7, to the transition t,-. If pk e O(t,-), then there
exists a directed arc aik, aikA, from the transition t,- to the place pk. If
W(sm) 2 Wm, Wm 6 [0,1], then the support srn is said to be associated with a
real value Wm. If G(t,-)=c,-, c,-, 6 [0,1], then the transition t,- is said to be
associated with a real value c,. If [53(15): 4,, die D, then the place [7, is said
to be associated with the proposition  An APN with some places con-
taining tokens is called a marked APN. In a marked APN, the token in a
place [7, is represented by a labeled dot . The token value in a place [7],
pie P, is denoted by 05(1),), where 05(1),)6 [0,1]. If or(p,~)=y,- and ,B(pj) :4,
then it indicates that the proposition  is y,-. According to the antecedent
portion or consequence portion of an APR contains ‘and’ or ‘or’ con-
nectors, the APRs has ﬁve rule types (Shih et al., 2007).

3.3.2 Associative transition function Let IT 2 {[1, i2, . . . ,im} be a set
of items and DT be a set of database transactions. An association rule
is an implication of the form A—>B, where A C IT, B C IT and
A H B = d). The association rule A—>B holds in the transaction set
DT with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in DT
that contain A U B. This is taken to be the probability P(A U B). The
association rule A—>B has conﬁdence c in the transaction set DT if c is
the percentage of transactions in DT containing A that also contain B.

This is taken to be the conditional probability P(BlA) (Agrawal et a].
1993). That is,

Support (A => B) = P(A U B) (9)

Conﬁdence (A => B) = P(B/A) (10)

Typically, association rules are considered interesting if they satisfy
both a minimum support threshold rm, rm 6 [0, 1], and a minimum con-
ﬁdence threshold 14-, y,- e [0, 1]. If the values of support and conﬁdence
are higher than their threshold 1: and y, the transition is enabled and the
CF value of transition is corresponding to its conﬁdence value (CF 2 ci)
else the relationship does not exist (CF 2 0). A generalized formulation of
the CF is shown in Equation (11):

c,, if sm 3 rm and c,- 3 y,-

Gm) 2 {0 Otherwise (11)

where c,- is the conﬁdence value, y,- is a threshold of conﬁdence, sm is the
support value and rm is a threshold of support.

3.3.3 Reasoning process An APN model can be expressed as a net-
work structure. Each place in the network is denoted by a triple (pk, a(pk),

APN = (P, T,S, cum: I, 0, 0:, B, G, W)
where

P = {P1, 172, ..... upn} is a ﬁnite set of places,
2 {11, t2, .... 0 ti} is a ﬁnite set of transitions,

2 {51, 52, .... man} 15 a ﬁnite set of supports,

{cvcv .... mci} 15 a ﬁnite set of conﬁdences,

{01” d2, _____ "01"} is a ﬁnite set of propositions,

{>DClliVJW

1" = {yv 72’ _____ UK} is a ﬁnite set of thresholds of the conﬁdences,

PnTnD=¢,|P|=|D|

I ; T _) P“3 is an input ﬁmction, a mapping from transitions to
bags of places,

0;T _) P“3 is an output function, a mapping from transitions to
bags of places,

real values between zero and one,

places to propositions,

G ; T _, [0,1] is an association function which assigns a real value

between zero to one to each transition
W Z S _, [0,1] is an association function which assigns a real Value

between zero to one to each support.

4 EXPERIMENT

The experimental procedure for arrhythmia-beat detection is
divided into ECG filtering and sampling, feature extraction,
transfer function building and classiﬁcation.

4.1 ECG ﬁltering and sampling

First, we use a non-linear bilateral filter (Elad, 2002) to remove
noise. The sampling size of our dataset has been estimated by the
population ratio (Mendenhall and Beaver, 1994):

22 P 1 — P
n = % (12)
where n is the sampling size, P is the estimator, e is the sampling
error, 0: is the confidence coefﬁcient and z is the standard normal
probability distribution. Since there is no further study in the
estimation of an ECG beat will be the abnormal beat’s probabil-
ity. Therefore, we use non-constant number sampling to obtain
the abnormal beat’s proportion of population in ten time’s trial,
which is shown in Table 2. From Table 2, we can obtain an
abnormal beat’s estimator (population proportion expected
value) as follow:

P = 2 C, * P, = 0.0611844
i=1

An APN model for Arrhythmic beat classification

 

where C, is beat weight that is the sample proportion of sampling
i time, P, is abnormal ratio of sampling i time. C, and P, are
shown in Table 2.

Substitute P-value, with 0.95 conﬁdence levels and 0.02 sam-
pling error in y sampling beat in different group, as shown in
Table 3, we obtained 553 beat (with 120 normal and 433 abnor-
mal) in our sampling data set. By randomly select, about two-
thirds (67.5%) of the data set are used to training our proposed
APN knowledge model and one-third (32.5%) of the data set are
used to evaluate the proposed APN model.

4.2 Feature extraction

Selected features are important in enhancing the performance of
ECG arrhythmia-beat detection. After detailed survey, we used
the features listed in Table 4 for our prototyping.

The steps of detecting peaks are (i) calculating the moving

error, peaks’ amplitude would be measured from k line as shown
in Figure 4 (Shih et al., 2010). The definition of k line is in
Equation (13).

k=Max(6,,i=1,2,---,11)+c (13)

where k is a baseline, 6 is the greatest amplitude of all peak, i is
type of heartbeat and c is a constant. Therefore, the amplitude of
peaks P, Q, R, S and T are all homogeneous negative.

4.3 Transfer function building

Membership functions and thresholds are determined by MEPA
(Christensen, 1980) in Section 3.2. Each of the features is parti-
tioned into three states which are high, median, and low. For
example, Figure 5 is the membership function of TH and the
membership functions of some other features are shown in
Appendix A.

4.4 APN model construction

The structure of our APN model for arrhythmia beat detection is
constructed by using the construction algorithm from Shih et al.
(2013) and is shown in Figure 6. Our APN model for the symp-
toms of heart-disease reasoning have eight variables, 11 middle
states (one normal heart beat and 10 symptoms of heart disease),
and one final state. All the degree of truth and states of the input
places in the APN are gained by the membership functions cal-
culated by Equation (11).

4.5 An example of arrhythmia-beat classiﬁcation

An APN reasoning algorithm, in Section 3.3, is used to classify
heart-beat symptoms into the following category: normal/abnor-
mal heartbeat or 11 different types of arrhythmia beat. APN

Fig. 6. An APN model for arrhythmia beat detection

model in Figure 6 is used for reasoning of arrhythmia-beat clas-
sification and has five inputs, three middle states, 11 outputs and
one final state. For example, assume that ﬁve inputs character-
istics [x1, x2, . . . , x5] of an ECG-extracted signal from ECG wave
are [—2.7162, —2.3648, —1.2864, —0.5810, —0.213]. From
Appendix A, we can obtain the membership degree and the lin-
guistic values of this ECG-extracted signal are [M, L, M, M, H]
and [0.708, 1.0, 0.970, 0.791, 1.0]. Then 05(1),) 20.708,
01(15): 1.0, . . . , 01(p5) = 1.0 are a mapping from places 1),,
p2,. . . , [)5 to its real values by using membership function. The
1),, p2,..., [)5 are starting places, where A>0 shows that the
proposition exists and A20 shows that the proposition does
not exist. Let 13(1),)2d1 and 13(p2)=d2, . . . , 13(p8)=d8 and d1,
d2, d3, . . . , d8 are eight propositions of ECG signals is shown in
Table 4. The propositions d9, d10, . . . , d19 denote 11 clusters of
heartbeat. Let place p20 be a goal place, d20(v) is the proposition
of goal place 1020 and 01(p20(v)) is the degree of truth of d20(v).
Assume that all the threshold values of 1,]- and y,- are set to 0.05
and 0.02, respectively. The reasoning example of our APN for
the symptoms of heart-disease reasoning is as follow:

Step 1: From starting places 1),, p2, . . .105: places 1),, p2, . . . , [)5
are starting places and 13(1),)2d1, 13(p2)=d2, . . . ,
13(p5)=d5 are 5 propositions of starting places.
IRS(I’s) = {[76, P731013}

Step 2: In descendant place 1),, p,eIRS(1),), s=1, 2,...,5;
i=6, 7,8.

AP,,: {1),, p2, . . . , p5} and all transitions are enabled, places
1),, p2, . . . , [)5 are exist since (01(1),) 3 A) and all the values of sup-
port and conﬁdence are greater than threshold 1' and y, except
658 (i.e. s,,3 1",,2 0.05 and 6,,3 y,, = 0.02, s: 1,2, . . . , 5; i: 6, 7,
8). Tokens are moved from 1),, p2, . . . , [)5 to 106, 107, 108. Since the
antecedent portion or consequence portion of APRs between 1),,
p2, . . . , p5 and 106, 107, [)8 belongs to type 3, the reasoning function
is ‘Max’ operator (Shih et al., 2007). The degree of truth of
proposition of place 106, 107, [)8 are

g=01(1),)=Max{0i(1),) * 6,, | s=1, 2, . . . , 5, i=6, 7, 8}, then,

“(178)2Maxi0‘074) * C48: “(175) * 658},

= Max{0.792*0. 1492, 0} = 0.1182
Therefore, 01(1), | i=6, 7, 8): {0.3486, 0.2077, 0.1182}.

Step 3: At descendant place 1),, pjeIRS(1),-), i=6, 7, 8; j=9,

AP,J-= {p6, 107, p8} and all transitions are enabled, places 106, 107,
[)8 are exist since (01(1),)3A). Some paths are not discarded,
since the values of support and conﬁdence are less than thresh-
old I and y, such as p6—>p14, p7 —>p11, etc. (i.e. s,J-3 1,720.05
and 6,1314]- 20.02, j=6, 7, 8; j=9, 10,..., 19). Tokens are
moved from 106, 107, 108. Since the antecedent portion or conse-
quence portion of APRs between 106, 107, p8 and p9, 1010, . . . , [)9
belongs to type 1, the reasoning function is ‘Min’ operator (Shih
et al., 2007). The degree of truth of proposition at place 109,

P10, - - - 3 P19 are
g=01(1)j)=Min{0i(p,-) * 6,] i=6, 7, 8;j=9,10,...,19},

Therefore, 05(1), | 1:9, 10,..., 19)={0.0105, 0.0112, 0.0319,

5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is used in our experiment.
We use 368 cases in training and 185 cases for testing from
sampled data in Table 3. After APN model construction, the
testing result in confusion matrix of our proposed APN model
is summarized in Table 5. Table 6 summarized the other re-
ported results of heart-beat recognition with Fuzzy Petri net
(Shih et al., 2010), support vector machine (Acir, 2006),
neuro-fuzzy network (Engin, 2004), fuzzy hybrid neural net-
work (Osowski and Linh, 2001) and mirrored gauss model
(Zhou et al., 2005). Our proposed APN model can successfully
recognize most of clusters since every cluster’s accuracy are all
greater than 90%.

In addition, our proposed APN model was further evaluated
by the following performance measure such as: true positive rate
(sensitivity) (TP-rate: TP/(TP+ FN)), true negative rate (speci-
ﬁcity) (TN-rate=TN/(FP+TN)), false positive rate (FP-
rate: FP/(FP+TN)) and false negative rate (FN-rate: FN/
(TP+ FN)). Accuracy is deﬁned with equation (TP+TN)/
(TP+ FP+ FN+TN). F—measure combines precision TP/
(TP + FP) and recall TP/(TP + FN) on the prediction of positive
class (F-measure = 2 x precision x recall/precision + recall). A
higher F—measure value indicates that the model performs
better on positive class balancing of FP and FN. G-mean is
the product of the prediction accuracies for both classes which
is ‘/TN/(TN+FP)xTP/(TP+FN). And, AUC is the area
under ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) curve calcu-
lated with MedCalc (http://www.medca1c.org/index.php). Higher

Other data mining methods such as Na‘l've Bayes (NB), Decision
tree (C4.5), Bayes Net, Support vector machine (SVM) and
Fuzzy Petri net (FPN) running with Weka and MATLAB
2012 are shown in Table 7 for comparison. APNs and C45
have a higher TN-rate in detecting abnormal heartbeat. SVM
and FPN have a good TP-rate in detecting normal heartbeat
in our experiment. Generally, in Table 7, our APN have the
best performance than other data-mining methods in sensitivity,
F—measure and accuracy measurement. And, other measure-
ments are great too. Therefore, we can conclude that our pro-
posed APN model have a good result on classiﬁcation of ECG
arrhythmias.

6 CONCLUSION

We have proposed a methodology for the detection of ECG
arrhythmia using a generalized APN model in this article. The
performance evaluation using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database in
Table 7 shows that our approach compares well with other re-
ported studies. The experimental results strongly suggest that our
proposed APN model can help doctors in the diagnosis of ECG
Arrhythmia and may applied to other symptom decision ﬁeld. In
the future, an applicable decision system for the clinical diagnosis
of ECG arrhythmias can developed based on our provided APN
model. And, the health care practitioners can be aware of types

of cardiac arrhythmias and give early treatment to reduce
deterioration.

APN is a powerful method for representing knowledge and
logic reasoning in the domain of decision support systems.
Unlike other Petri net model, APN model has a systematic pro-
cedure in model construction. The reasoning path of expert sys-
tems can be reduced to simple sprouting trees if APN-based
reasoning algorithms can be applied. However, there still draw-
backs exist in APN such as state explosion and no hierarchy
concepts. We shall overcome all these drawbacks in the near
future.

Abstract

The wound healing assay (or scratch assay) is a technique frequently used to quantify the dependence
of cell motility—a central process in tissue repair and evolution of disease—subject to various treat—
ments conditions. However processing the resulting data is a laborious task due its high throughput
and variability across images. This Robust Quantitative Scratch Assay algorithm introduced statistical
outputs where migration rates are estimated, cellular behaviour is distinguished and outliers
are identified among groups of unique experimental conditions. Furthermore, the ROSA decreased
measurement errors and increased accuracy in the wound boundary at comparable processing times
compared to previously developed method (TScratch).

1 Introduction

Since cell migration is significant in repair processes and disease ad—
vancement such as metastasis and cancer angiogenesis, it can be used
as a parameter to describe the state of health of various cell lines
(Geback et (11., 2009; Zordan et (11., 2011). Furthermore, quantifica—
tion of cell migration can be used to measure the effect of drug treat—
ments on the same cell line. The Wound Healing Assay (WHA) is
used to quantify motility by monitoring the evolution of a wounded
monolayer of cells. The experimental set—up consists of growing a
conﬂuent monolayer of cells under specific conditions (i.e. treated or
not treated with a drug), then creating a wound or scratch on each
layer/well, and then imaging all wounds multiple times over a period
of time. Since the rate how wounds close may depend on conditions

used, measuring wound areas from individual images are used to esti—
mate migration rates, and thus quantify condition—specific cell motil—
ity. (Jonkman et al. 2014) provide extensive insight on experimental
design considerations and workﬂow of the WHA measurements.
In order to obtain reliable results, it is necessary to measure wound
areas across multiple replicates of the same cell condition, and record
multiple frames per replicate to determine whether changes are statis—
tically significant. To make this task feasible, an automated system is
required to process the high volumes of data and make measurements
independent of image artefacts such as uneven illuminations, smudges
or scratches on the well plate lid, in addition to some variation of ini—
tial wound width and shape. Sample images of wound areas are
shown in Supplementary Material.

While previous methods by Geback et al. and Zordan et al. sup—
port automated WHA image analysis, they lack a final statistical
output estimating the migration rates per condition, and lack an
image set for validation, therefore depending on the acquisition par—
ameters, these methods may or may not work. Therefore, we have
developed the Robust Quantitative Scratch Assay (RQSA) algorithm
using MATLAB 7.11.0 to address the challenges imposed by the
large datasets, variability in image illuminations and implemented a
statistical output for an improved quantification of cell motility
using the wound healing assay. Furthermore, we provide image
datasets for reproducibility and have developed a set of guidelines
for future WHA image acquisitions.

2 Methods

The algorithm requires MATLAB 7.11.0 (or GNU Octave) and uses
the Statistics and Image Processing Toolboxes. In order to design
and validate the RQSA algorithm a training and testing image data—
sets were acquired and are described in detail in Section 1.1 of the
Supplementary Material. The image and data processing comprises
measuring individual open wound areas for each well using a se—
quence of morphological and spatial filters (Gonzales, 2003; http://
www.mathworks.com). Then the resulting open wound area vs.
frame curve is fitted to a polynomial curve using the Least Squares
method in order to calculate migration rates, coefficients of deter—
mination (R2), and to label the temporal behavior for each well. The
estimated migration rates for all wells in a single condition are
grouped, then outliers are flagged and discarded before calculating
the average migration rate for each experimental condition. Last,
the average migration rates are compared across all experimental
conditions. The statistical analysis is output as a text file; Section
1.3 in Supplementary Material shows sample open wound area
curves, sample output text file for a single condition and describes
the process for outlier detection.

3 Results

The robustness and improved performance of the RQSA algorithm
was evaluated over a ‘Robustness set’—a set of images (N : 268) with
various features, such as high/low image illumination, resolution,
cell conﬂuence, and stray cells in the wound area. Open Wound Areas
and Wound Estimate were measured with the RQSA algorithm and
TScratch were compared to manual measurements, Figure 1 shows the
error in Open Wound Area for this subset. Section 2.1 in
Supplementary Material describes these metrics of comparison
with more detail and discusses the robustness of the algorithm. A
paired t—test was performed on the errors in Open wound area and
errors in Wound estimate using both methods, where resulting p—values
(P < 0.05) determined that there is a statistical difference between both
methods. Overall RQSA showed better representation of the wound
boundaries resulting in a more accurate estimate of migration rates
over all conditions.

Both methods were tested using a validation set, and results were
compared by determining R2 from the fitted curves in both experi—
mental conditions. The non—treated condition with RQSA shows an
R2 value centered at 1.0, suggesting that the open wound areas vs.
frame from the RQSA algorithm yield a better description of the
temporal behavior of the wound, and shows less variability across
time points. Meanwhile, the lower R2 values of the TScratch polyno—
mial fits suggest that measurements ﬂuctuate highly from one frame
to the other.

The RQSA was run using an additional independent set with a
different cell line and treatments, to demonstrate its robustness.
Results of both datasets with statistical analysis including average
migrations rates, uncertainties, identified possible well outliers, and
are further discussed in Section 2.2 of Supplementary Material.

Future directions for the RQSA include the incorporation
of cell segmentation routines to provide a morphological and prolif—
eration assessment on individual cells, and implementation of paral—
lel computing techniques to decrease processing times and increase
efficiency.

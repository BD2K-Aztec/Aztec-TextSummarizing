Abstract

Motivation: An accurate genome assembly from short read sequencing data is critical for down—
stream analysis, for example allowing investigation of variants within a sequenced population.
However, assembling sequencing data from virus samples, especially RNA viruses, into a genome
sequence is challenging due to the combination of viral population diversity and extremely uneven
read depth caused by amplification bias in the inevitable reverse transcription and polymerase
chain reaction amplification process of current methods.

Results: We developed a new de novo assembler called IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler) designed
specifically for read pairs sequenced at highly variable depth from RNA virus samples. We tested
IVA on datasets from 140 sequenced samples from human immunodeficiency virus—1 0r influenza—
virus—infected people and demonstrated that IVA outperforms all other virus de novo assemblers.
Availability and implementation: The software runs under Linux, has the GPLV3 licence and is
freely available from http://sanger—pathogens.github.i0/iva

1 Introduction

The main challenge of assembling sequence data from an RNA virus
sample into a consensus sequence lies in the extremely variable read
depth from current sequencing approaches combined with the exten-
sive viral population diversity. An example is shown in Figure 1
where regions of the genome are represented with different read
depths, caused by the separate reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction amplification of overlapping regions of the genome
before library preparation. Further, there is a relatively high rate of
single base differences in the reads throughout the genome. These
properties of the data cause standard assembly algorithms to

produce multiple contigs covering the same region and, more signifi-
cantly, miss regions of the genome entirely (Yang et (11., 2012).
Despite the availability of at least 40 genome assemblers (http://
en.wikipedia.org/wil<i/Sequenceiassembly), VICUNA (Yang et (11.,
2012) and PRICE (Ruby et (11., 2013) are currently the only assem-
blers designed for virus data. VICUNA tackles the assembly problem
by first clustering the reads that should belong to the same contig,
using min hashes to infer similarity. Contigs are generated and then
merged to form the final output. PRICE begins with seed sequences,
which are iteratively extended by generating new sequence from
local assemblies of reads at contig ends. In addition, the RNA-seq

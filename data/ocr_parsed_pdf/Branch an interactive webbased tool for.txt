Abstract

Summary: Branch is a web application that provides users with the ability to interact directly with
large biomedical datasets. The interaction is mediated through a collaborative graphical user inter—
face for building and evaluating decision trees. These trees can be used to compose and test
sophisticated hypotheses and to develop predictive models. Decision trees are built and evaluated
based on a library of imported datasets and can be stored in a collective area for sharing and

re—use.

Availability and implementation: Branch is hosted at http://biobranch.org/ and the open source

code is available at http://bitbucket.org/sulab/biobranchl.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

 

1 Introduction

Scientific advances based on large datasets often involve a cycle of
interactions between experts in computation (‘data scientists’) and
experts in the domain of inquiry. Typically, computational scientists
will need to adapt scripts for data analysis and presentation at each
step, limiting the number of potential iterations and resulting in rela—
tively little feedback from the subject matter expert. Graphical inter—
faces for data exploration can empower domain experts with the
ability to engage with data directly, increasing their capacity to rap—
idly define and answer questions leading to new insights (Hinterberg
et (11., 2015).

Given a dataset with many features (e.g. gene expression meas—
urements, clinical attributes) and nominal class values for each sam—
ple (e.g. breast cancer relapse status), a decision tree can provide a
visual representation of a sophisticated logic function linking selected
input features to an output class. Decision trees are often induced
automatically from training data and applied to classify new

samples. They can also be constructed manually, with the intent to
either incorporate domain expertise into their structure to improve
generalizability (Stumpf et (11., 2009) or to test specific hypotheses.
As one example of the latter process, a researcher may ask whether a
dataset supports her hypothesis that breast cancer relapse will be
associated with high levels of PSR C1 expression or a combination of
low levels of PSCRI and high levels of BRCA1. This hypothesis can
be represented as a decision tree rooted in a feature for PSRCI gene
expression with a leaf node predicting relapse for high PSCRI and a
secondary split under low PSCRI on BRCAI expression (Fig. 1).
The extent to which this decision tree fits the dataset, measured by
e.g. its predictive accuracy or a statistical test of association between
samples in leaf nodes and their actual class values (Fig. 1B), indicates
the extent to which the data supports the hypothesis. Here we intro—
duce an interactive, collaborative Web application, called Branch,
that allows domain experts to rapidly and easily build, evaluate and
share decision trees based on large biomedical datasets.

2 Using Branch

2.1 Dataset library

Users begin by selecting a dataset from the Branch dataset library.
Each dataset corresponds to a single table where each row contains
the values for a set of features, e.g. gene expression levels or clinical
variables, and a binary class label for each sample, e.g. cancer/
normal. The Branch library currently contains several datasets se—
lected to demonstrate the features of the application. Additional
datasets may be loaded upon request. Branch may also be installed
locally from its open source code, allowing the user to load their
own datasets.

2.2 Evaluation

Once a dataset is selected, the user must choose a process for evalu—
ating the trees that they will build. In using the tool to iteratively cre—
ate, test and adapt decision trees, the user can act much like a
learning algorithm. As in machine learning, the choice of evaluation
process can be used to reduce the likelihood of overfitting the data.
The user may select from three options: ‘test set’, ‘percentage split’
and ‘training’ (Supplementary Fig. S1). When distinct training and
testing sets are available the ‘test set’ option enables the user to build
their trees using feedback, such as feature rankings, from the train—
ing set while seeing the global evaluation metrics (AUC, Accuracy,
etc.) based on the tree’s performance on the unseen test set. When
no independent test set is available, this process may be simulated
using the ‘percentage split’ option. Finally, users that are only inter—
ested in seeing precisely how a tree fits a dataset may choose the
‘training set’ evaluation function.

2.3 Building trees

Given a dataset and an evaluation method, the user can begin con—
structing decision trees and measuring their quality (Fig. 1). Building
a tree corresponds to the process of iteratively adding split nodes.
Branch supports five different split node types. Most simply, single
feature splits such as the split on PSRCI in Figure 1 may be created
from individual features such as the expression values for a particular
gene or the age of a patient (Supplementary Fig. S2). Custom features
may be created as linear combinations of other features. For example,
the Oncotyper (Paik et (11., 2004) breast cancer recurrence score
can be recreated and applied as a feature for use in single Branch split
nodes (Supplementary Section S3, Supplementary Fig. S3—S6). The
user may also choose to use built—in machine learning algorithms to
infer a predictive model from a feature subset and use the model for a
decision node (Supplementary Fig. S7). Likewise, previously created
trees can be used as individual decision nodes. Finally, the system pro—
vides a visual split creator that lets the user define decision boundaries
graphically (Supplementary Fig. S8) (Ware et (11., 2001). A tree may
incorporate mixtures of these different node types.

Users can begin building a tree from scratch or can select an
existing tree from the community library or their personal collec—
tion. Once created, the user may save their tree to the public collec—
tion or keep it private. Branch is specifically useful for the analysis
of large biological datasets with well—defined class values. In cases
where users may want to define their own complex classes, a related
tool for user—guided decision tree analysis called Peax may be more
appropriate (Hinterberg et (11., 2015).

3 Conclusion

Branch provides a new mechanism to connect a large pool of bio—
logically savvy (but perhaps not computationally savvy) researchers
with large, high—dimensional datasets. The rich, graphical user inter—
face reduces barriers between researchers and data, stimulating
rapid, direct exploration of previously opaque yet valuable informa—
tion. In addition, Branch is uniquely collaborative, providing an un—
precedented avenue for researchers to share their hypotheses and
their predictive models with the community and to build on the
work of others.

3.1 Implementation

Branch is available online at http://biobranch.org with open source
code available at http://bitbucket.org/sulab/biobranch. It consists of
a Java Spring server application that takes advantage of the Weka
(Frank et (11., 2004) machine learning library and a Web client appli—
cation based on Backbone.js and d3.js (Bostock et (11., 201 1).

Abstract

Summary: Functional annotation represents a key step toward the understanding and interpret—
ation of germline and somatic variation as revealed by genome—wide association studies (GWAS)
and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively. GWAS have revealed numerous genetic risk
variants residing in non—coding DNA associated with complex diseases. For sequences that lie
within enhancers or promoters of transcription, it is not straightforward to assess the effects of
variants on likely transcription factor binding sites. Consequently we introduce motifbreakR, which
allows the biologist to judge whether the sequence surrounding a polymorphism or mutation is a
good match, and how much information is gained or lost in one allele ofthe polymorphism or mu—
tation relative to the other. MotifbreakR is flexible, giving a choice of algorithms for interrogation of
genomes with motifs from many public sources that users can choose from. MotifbreakR can pre—
dict effects for novel or previously described variants in public databases, making it suitable for
tasks beyond the scope of its original design. Lastly, it can be used to interrogate any genome cura—
ted within bioconductor.

1 Introduction

Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are typically short DNA
sequence motifs that facilitate binding of a specific transcription fac-
tors via protein—DNA interactions (Stormo, 2000). There are some
software tools that facilitate the scoring of non-coding variants with
respect to either predefined or user-specified motifs. RegulomeDB,
HaploReg and FunSeq each enable assessment of the effects of single
nucleotide variants on predicted binding sites (Boyle et (11., 2012;
Khurana et (11., 2013; Ward and Kellis, 2012). Each of these pack-
ages has strengths, but does not provide the analysis independent of
its other functions. Many users generate their own motifs, but users
are limited to built-in motif collections and functions. The functions

are largely unavailable to non-human data sets. We hereby intro-
duce an R/bioconductor software package called TVZOﬁﬂN‘C’ZZkR that
addresses these major concerns. Implementation in R has the advan-
tage of universality: R and bioconductor are widely used for bio-
informatics and well supported across different platforms including
Galaxy (Tenenbaum, 2015).

2 Features

2.1 Germline or somatic variants

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be generated from an-
other R package such as FunciSNP (Coetzee et (11., 2012), or read in
directly from .bed or .vcf files. The SNPs then need to be converted

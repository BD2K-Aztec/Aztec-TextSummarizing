ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput ChlP-seq studies typically identify thou-
sands of peaks for a single transcription factor (T F). It is common for
traditional motif discovery tools to predict motifs that are statistically
significant against a na'ive background distribution but are of question-
able biological relevance.

Results: We describe a simple yet effective algorithm for discovering
differential motifs between two sequence datasets that is effective in
eliminating systematic biases and scalable to large datasets. Tested
on 207 ENCODE ChlP-seq datasets, our method identifies correct
motifs in 78% of the datasets with known motifs, demonstrating
improvement in both accuracy and efficiency compared with
DREME, another state-of-art discriminative motif discovery tool.
More interestingly, on the remaining more challenging datasets, we
identify common technical or biological factors that compromise the
motif search results and use advanced features of our tool to control
for these factors. We also present case studies demonstrating the
ability of our method to detect single base pair differences in DNA
specificity of two similar TFs. Lastly, we demonstrate discovery of
key TF motifs involved in tissue specification by examination of
high-throughput DNase accessibility data.

Availability: The motifRG package is publically available via the
bioconductor repository.

1 INTRODUCTION

The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technology for
genome-wide proﬁling of transcription factor binding sites
(TFBS) has made precise categorization of their DNA motifs
possible. Harnessing the power of large quantities of data gen-
erated by this technology presents many computational chal-
lenges. Motif discovery is a classical bioinformatics problem
and has been an active area of research for decades. Existing

tools can be roughly classiﬁed as profile-based, such as MEME
(Bailey and Elkan, 1995), or pattern-based like CONSENSUS
(Hertz and Stormo, 1999) [see (Tompa et al., 2005) for a review
and performance study of popular motif discovery tools]. Most
of these tools, however, do not easily scale to large datasets.
Users typically limit the motif search to top ranking peaks,
thus sacrifice the power of the data, which may be critical for
accurate modeling of the TFBS and for identiﬁcation of cofac-
tors. Large amounts of data also increase the power to detect
various non-random signals, many of which may not be directly
related to the problem of interest. The new challenge is to under-
stand the nature of motif signals and determine the relevant ones.
We propose to test the motif enrichment in a foreground dataset
against an explicitly stated background dataset, rather against a
non-informative null distribution. The background dataset
should be carefully selected to represent the systematic biases
present in the foreground.

Discriminative motif discovery is not a new approach.
Pioneering work includes, but is not limited to, DME (Smith
et al., 2006), DIPS (Sinha, 2006) and DEME (Redhead and
Bailey, 2007). These methods find a discriminative position
weight matrix (PWM) to optimize an objective function, which
for the case of DEME and DME, is the likelihood of the data
given the model and sequence class. However, the optimization
procedures of many of these methods are computationally
expensive, making them unsuitable for large datasets. Recent
works designed for high-throughput datasets use more simplified
statistical models. For example, DREME [MEME suite (Bailey,
2011)] and oligo-diff [RSAT suite (Thomas-Chollier et al., 2012)]
use Fisher’s exact test and PeakRegressor (Pessiot et al., 2010)
applies a linear regression model to fit peak scores by motif
counts.

In this study, we propose a new discriminative motif discovery
algorithm motifRG that distinguishes two sequence datasets.
We measure the discriminative power of a motif by a logistic
regression model, which shows some similarity to DREME
and PeakRegressor, but offers a better combination of robust-
ness and ﬂexibility. We also provide an effective and efficient
iterative process for motif reﬁnement and extension and apply
a bootstrap robustness test to avoid over-fitting in the optimiza-
tion process. The logistic regression framework offers direct

measurement of statistical signiﬁcance, and we demonstrate by
permutation tests that the associated 2 statistics reﬂect the prob-
ability of occurrence by chance. This framework also provides
ﬂexibility to handle existing bias between the two datasets, and to
weight the sequences according to their importance, both import-
ant features when dealing with some challenging datasets (see
Section 3 for details). The method is implemented in R (R
Development Core Team, 2010) Bioconductor Core Team, and
is publicly available Via the Bioconductor (Gentleman et al.,
2004) repository.

We applied this method in a comprehensive motif study of 207
ENCODE ChIP—seq datasets for TFBS. Under the default set-
ting, motifRG successfully discovered accurate motifs in 78% of
the datasets with known motifs, demonstrating its ﬂexibility
in handling diverse applications. In many cases, biologically
plausible cofactor motifs are also discovered. Compared with
DREME, motifRG had comparable performance at identifying
the core motif, and generally ran about 40% faster. Its advan-
tages over DREME in terms of both accuracy and efﬁciency are
more obvious for longer motifs and motifs with degenerate
ﬂanking sequences, probably due to a more effective reﬁnement
procedure. By exploring the cases where we fail to detect known
motifs, we identify several common factors likely to compromise
the motif search results and propose strategies that exploit the
ﬂexibility of motifRG to deal with these challenges. Using one
in-depth case study, we demonstrate the power of discriminative
motif analysis for the study of DNA binding speciﬁcity of similar
members of one protein family. We also show that this tool can
be applied to DNaseI accessibility datasets to identify TFBS that
are enriched at cell type speciﬁc accessible sites, which may act as
key regulators of cell lineage specific chromatin remodeling.

Our method, and discriminative motif discovery in general, rep-
resents powerful tools to exploit various types of high-throughput
datasets to answer many fundamental biological questions.

2 METHODS

2.1 Logistic regression modeling of motifs

We cast the problem of discriminative motif discovery in the framework
of logistic regression. For a given motif, let x be the motif count in each
sequence. The basic assumption of logistic regression is that sequences
with equal motif counts have equal probabilities P of containing binding
sites, and that the logarithm of the odds ratio is linearly related to the
count:

 

[0g = .50 +131X

[7
1 — p
More generally, we ﬁt

p
1—17

 

10g =/30+/31X+/52W

where w represents :1 optional terms reﬂecting other biases such as GC
content. Model parameters ([5,) are estimated by the principle of max-
imum likelihood. The statistical signiﬁcance of each coefficient ,8,- is esti-

mated by a Wald test, which calculates Z—statistics: Z =  where ,5,- is the
maximum likelihood estimate of ,8,- and se the estimated standard error of
[5,. The 2 value is then squared, yielding a Wald statistic with a chi-square
distribution (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000; Sinha, 2006). Our motif
search optimization goal is to ﬁnd a motif representation with maximum
absolute z-value. As motif counts have few unique values, we tabulate the

all values of x and ﬁt the model with only the unique values, weighting
each unique value by its count. For applications in which the sequences
are weighted, the weight for each unique value is the sum of all weights of
the sequences with the given value. This reduced representation speeds up
the logistic regression model signiﬁcantly for large datasets.

Regression was introduced to motif search by pioneering work of
Bussemaker et a]. (2001), which models the correlation of motif occur-
rences and gene expression by linear regression. A similar model was
adopted by PeakRegressor for applications for ChIP-Seq datasets,
which uses peak scores as response. A potential pitfall of this model is
sensitivity to outliers. PeakRegressor tried to avoid the problem of out-
liers by using different regularization techniques such as Ll-norm, ridge
regression and so forth, which involve additional parameterization.
Recent study suggests that other factors such as chromatin accessibility
(John et al., 2011; Neph et al., 2012) are likely to have greater effect on
intensities of ChIP-Seq signal than motif counts. We believe logistic
regression is an appropriate choice for this application because it offers
a good combination of ﬂexibility and robustness.

2.2 Search strategy

We start by enumerating all nmers with a given width 11, ﬁtting the above
regression model and sorting the nmers by the absolute z-value. The most
signiﬁcant nmer is chosen as the seed motif. To address the concern that
candidates with small enrichment can be highly statistical signiﬁcant in
large datasets, we set an enrichment ratio threshold for the seed motif to
ensure that the enrichment is biologically meaningful. We further reﬁne
the seed motif by extension and small perturbations by testing all variants
with Hamming distance of one over the full IUPAC nucleotide alphabet.
The general ﬂow chart of this method is shown in Figure 1.

To extend the seed, we append a given number f of Ns at both sides of
the motif and enumerate all replacements of one N letter by a more
speciﬁc letter in the IUPAC alphabet. We choose the one with maximum
absolute z-value, which becomes the new motif if it improves the z-value,
and repeat this process. If no further improvement can be made at the
current motif length, append additional Ns to both ends so that each side
still has f Ns. If no replacement of Ns yields a better motif, terminate
and trim all ﬂanking Ns. This process is illustrated in Supplementary
Figure SlB.

Next, we try to reﬁne the motif by small perturbations. We enumerate
all candidates with Hamming distance of one that are compatible with the
seed and not previously tested. We then choose the candidate with the
most improved z-value as the new motif. Repeat this process until no
improvement can be made. This process is illustrated in Supplementary
Figure SlC.

If there are any changes made to the seed at extension or permutation
steps, the whole reﬁnement process is repeated. Conceptually, we can
examine all extension and perturbation candidates at the same time.
We ﬁnd that separating the two steps yields better performance and

cuts down memory usage by decreasing the search space. We perform the
extension step first, as we think it is more important to determine the full-
length signature of the motif. In the extension step, the maximum number
of candidates tested is 2fM where f is the number of ﬂanking Ns on each
side, and M the size of IUPAC alphabet. In the perturbation step, the
maximum number is [M, where l is the length of the pattern. The per-
turbed patterns must be compatible with the initial seed motif, and we
ﬁlter the candidates by requiring either an increase of total foreground
counts or a decrease of total background counts, so the number of
allowed candidates is a lot smaller. Using this strategy we can afford to
extend the motif as long as needed.

The reﬁnement step can be subject to over-ﬁtting, as a small z-value
improvement may not be meaningful. To improve robustness, we per-
form the following bootstrap test to determine the signiﬁcance of the im-
provement: randomly sample the whole sequence dataset (including
positive and negative sequences) with replacement for a few times (default
5 times), calculate the z-values for the new and the original motif for
each sampling and compute the P-value by applying t-tests on two sets
of z-values. Accept the new motif if the P-value is under a given thresh-
old. Although the number of bootstraps we performed is small, we found
the variance estimate is reasonably accurate and informative to guide
reﬁnement to be more aggressive or conservative (see Section 3 for
details).

Candidate enumeration, evaluation and bootstrap validation can be
performed in parallel in each iteration, and parallelization is implemented
by the ‘parallel’ package of Bioconductor. After reﬁning the top motif, we
mask all of its occurrences and repeat the process to ﬁnd the next motif.

3 RESULTS
3.1 motifRG accurately predicted annotated motifs

To assess the performance of our method for de novo motif dis-
covery in a real world application under different conditions, we
tested it on 207 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets collected from two
groups, HAIB_TFBS by HudsonAlpha and SYDH_TFBS by
Yale and UCD (see Supplementary Table S1 for the complete
list). This dataset covers 82 unique TFs and 25 cell types with
different characteristics: the number of peaks varies from a few
hundreds to hundreds of thousands, the average GC content
ranges from 0.40 to 0.66 and median peak width varies from
100 to 1000 nucleotides (Supplementary Fig. S2). We made a
number of decisions to standardize/simplify the analysis and be-
lieve they have no real effect on the outcome. If the number of
peaks exceeded 50K, we randomly sampled 50K peaks. This
approach was further justiﬁed by the analysis presented below
in section ‘Motif signiﬁcance and sample size’, which examines
the effect of number of peaks on motif prediction. For each peak
in each dataset, we ﬁrst chose one corresponding background
sequence from the ﬂanking regions, randomly chosen from
either side (L200 nt from the edge of the peak, and with the
same width as the peak. We then predicted up to ﬁve enriched
motifs. Our software also identiﬁes depleted motifs, but they
were ignored here. To ﬁnd the annotated motif of the ChIP-ed
TF, we matched TF names/aliases with the motif names in the
motif databases Jaspar (Bryne et al., 2008; Redhead and Bailey,
2007) and Uniprobe (Newburger and Bulyk, 2009). If no exact
matches were found, we used the motif of a homolog; e.g. we
annotated Atf3 using the Atfl motif. We then compared the
PWMs derived from the top five predicted motifs against the
motif database using Tomtom (Tanaka et al., 2011) with default

settings. We claimed success in finding the annotated motif if it
was among the Tomtom reported matches. We compared our
results to DREME, which was run on the same sets of fore-
ground and background sequences under the default setting
with maximum of ﬁve output motifs.

Among 148 ENCODE datasets with annotated motifs for the
TF, motifRG identiﬁes a match to the annotated motif in 115
and does not identify a match in 33. By this criterion, we suc-
ceeded in ﬁnding the right motifs in 78% of datasets. In com-
parison, DREME found annotated motif in 116 datasets, almost
the same set as ours.

We hypothesized that the annotated motifs are not enriched
signiﬁcantly in the datasets where motifRG and/or DREME
failed. To test this hypothesis, we scanned for the best PWM
match of the annotated motif in each sequence in both the fore-
ground and the corresponding background datasets, and com-
puted AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve) (Brown, 2006) by varying the PWM threshold to discrim-
inate foreground from background. The datasets for which we
failed to find the motifs generally have low AUC, which suggest
low enrichment of the annotated motif relative to the control
(Fig. 2A). Therefore, we believe that failure to discover the
annotated motifs was likely due to the lack of the TF motif
enrichment in the datasets, rather than to the failure of the al-
gorithms. We plot the P-Values inferred by Tomtom for motifs
predicted by motifRG and DREME against each other in
Figure 2B. The two methods predict similar motifs most of the

time (Supplementary Table S2), whereas motifRG tends to infer
more information in the ﬂanking regions of core motifs, mani-
fested by overall better P—Values. To examine whether the differ-
ences were due to the fact that DREME uses maximum motif
width of 8 under default setting, we also ran DREME with max-
imum motif width of 12 (referred to as DREME12). However,
DREME12 did not demonstrate signiﬁcant improvement, and in
some cases, it terminated without predicting any motifs
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). Next we examined two examples in
which DREME succeeded, whereas motifRG failed. For the case
of SP1 in HepG2, the top motifs predicted by both DREME and
motifRG were motifs for cell type-speciﬁc master regulators
FOX and HNF4. MotifRG predict additional variants of
FOX, HNF4 and motif for ETS. When conﬁgured to predict
more motifs, motifRG discovers an SP1 motif among the top
eight motifs. For the case of MEF2A in GM12878, motifRG
predicted a more degenerate variant of MEF2A, which was
not detected by TOMTOM as matching the MEF2A motif.

The running time of motifRG grows linearly with size of input
(Supplementary Fig. S3B), and runs ~40% faster than DREME
(Fig. 2C), although such a difference can be easily affected by
implementation details and subject to change. DREME can be
configured to run with python package psyco for 2- to 3-fold
speedup, which we did not use due to lack of support by psyco
for 64-bit systems. Our method supports a parallel mode for
further speed-up, which we did not use for fair comparison.
DREME12 runs ~34 times slower than DREME under default
settings (Supplementary Fig. S3C), which suggests signiﬁcant
overhead for learning longer motifs, which is not the case for
our motif extension procedure. MotifRG uses a lot more
memory than DREME, as it is implemented in a high-level pro-
gramming language that exploits many third party functional-
ities. We performed memory proﬁling of motifRG to examine
the relationship between memory usage and input size
(Supplementary Fig. S3D), which suggested that memory usage
grows linearly with input size. Memory usage does not appear to
be a bottleneck for most applications, so we did not seek further
optimization at this point.

Next, we investigate the cases in which we failed to identify
the annotated motifs. The main compromising factors that we
identiﬁed include signiﬁcant GC bias, noisy/indirect binding sites
inferred by ChIP-Seq or overshadowing cofactors motifs. Many
TFBS lie in GC—rich regions (including CpG islands) at both the
promoter or enhancer regions. Although we tried to select back-
ground sequences with similar genomic context, the GC content
variation can be local, so it is still likely for foreground sequences
to have higher GC content, resulting in prediction of generic
GC—rich motifs. One can control for GC bias by using shufﬂed
sequences of the foreground that maintain the same nucleotide
or di-nucleotide composition as control. But, this may not be
sufﬁcient for adjusting other biases. Many TFs interact indirectly
with the DNA sequences through mechanisms such as tethering.
Indirect binding sites tend to have lower ChIP-seq signals com-
pared with directly bound sites and lower the motif enrichment
for the direct sites. We also note that many TFBS samples in the
same cell type are enriched for the same sets of motifs corres-
ponding to the master regulators in that cell type. For example,
most ChIP-Seq samples in GM12878 (a lymphoblastoid cell line)
have motif enrichment of RUNX, which is a key TF required for

lymphocyte differentiation (Wong et al., 2011). Although this is
an interesting phenomenon by itself, these motifs probably serve
a generic functional role in the given cell type rather than acting
as speciﬁc cofactor motifs for the ChIPped TF.

We designed the following strategy to cope with the above
issues: we used discretized (for efﬁciency) GC content as covari-
ant in the regression model, weighted the sequences based on
ChIP-seq signals that were then normalized by peak width and
chose background as accessible regions without ChIP-seq peaks.
Recent study suggests that most TFBS occur in the accessible
regions proﬁled by a DNaseI assay (Neph et al., 2012). By using
accessible regions without peaks as background, we hope to elim-
inate common motifs for all accessible regions and highlight the
ones that are speciﬁc for the ChIPped TF. Many other methods
can be used to adjust for discussed biases, such as using only the
top ranking peaks, using shufﬂed sequences as control and so
forth. But our approach provides enough ﬂexibility to addresses
multiple issues while keeping the power of large datasets. We
applied this strategy to 29 of 33 cases where we previously
failed, selected based on availability of appropriate DNaseI
data (Fig. 3). We predicted annotated motifs in 9 cases, where
we previously failed. For 7 of 20 remaining cases, we identiﬁed
the same novel motif for the same TF (Brcal and Six5, respect-
ively) across multiple cell types, whereas annotated motifs have
low enrichment across all cell types, suggesting that predicted
motifs are likely to be true motifs that are previously unknown.
We also found motifs for NFYA, a known cofactor (Li-Weber
et al., 1994) interacting with IRF homologs, to be strongly
enriched in two IRF3 samples, suggesting IRF3 is likely to
bind predominantly indirectly at its targets. The strongest pre-
dicted motif for JUND in HEPG2 corresponds to a known sec-
ondary motif for JUND. For RXRA in GM12878 and FOSLl
in thesc cell, it was puzzling why we failed in these cases,
whereas succeeded in the RXRA and FOSLl ChIP-Seq samples
generated by the same laboratory using the same antibody for
the other cell lines. After closer examination, we found evidence
suggesting that the protein or the protein complex interacting
with DNA may be present at low abundance in the given cell
type (Supplementary Fig. S4), leading to poor ChIP-seq results.
We have remaining 6 cases that are unaccounted for, which may
be subject to other issues such as antibody speciﬁcity, PCR bias
and so forth, and require further biological and technical exam-
ination. Overall, we found our refined strategy to be ﬂexible and
effective at addressing more challenging datasets.

Finally, we present the motifs predicted for proteins with no
annotated motifs in the database in Supplementary Table S3.
Although not annotated in the databases, numerous motifs
have been reported in the literature to bind the given TF or its
cofactors. For example, RAD21, a component of the cohesin
complex, is involved in chromosome cohesion, DNA repair
and apoptosis. We identiﬁed CTCF as its top motif, known
for recruitment of cohesin genome wide (Parelho et al., 2008).
Our method can be a powerful tool for curation of novel motifs
into motif datasets.

Fig. 3. MotifRG failure cases under default settings. Using a modiﬁed approach, we recover known motifs in many datasets. These datasets are
categorized as F (found), N (novel), C (interacting cofactor), A (secondary motif), W (weakly expressed ChIPped TF) and U (unknown). Columns
are cell type (Cell), TF, average GC content of the peak (gc), annotated motif (DB), categories (Tag), motifRG motifs that match the annotation and
corresponding P-values (motifRG) and the top four predicted motifs (Top motifs)

similar datasets. Here we demonstrate this in a case study to
assess DNA binding specificity for two similar TFs. MYOD
and NEUROD2 are both bHLH TFs that form heterodimers
with an E-protein and regulate myogenesis and neurogenesis,
respectively. Both bind a CANNTG E-box motif. A motif
search in MYOD ChIP or NEUROD2 ChIP sequences against
ﬂanking background revealed RRCAGSTG as the MYOD
motif and RRCAGMTGQ as the NEUROD2 motif (Fig. 4,
A1). Direct comparison of MYOD speciﬁc sites with
NEUROD2 speciﬁc sites (Fig. 4, A2) identiﬁed CAGQTG as
a MyoD private E-box and CAGATG as a NEUROD2 private
E-box, whereas the sites bound by both factors were enriched in
the CAGCTG E—box (Fong et al., 2012). The motif analysis

results were confirmed by gel shift and competition assays
(Fong et al., 2012).

We performed a similar comparison of MYOD and MSC in
Rhabdomyosarcoma. MSC is a bHLH protein that also forms
heterodimers with E—proteins and binds E-boxes and acts as an
inhibitor of muscle differentiation. We compared the binding
profiles of MYOD and MSC in the Rhabdomyosarcoma cell
line RD. The PWMs of the top motifs for both factors were
similar (Fig. 4, B1). Discriminative motif analysis by direct com-
parison of MYOD speciﬁc binding sites versus MSC speciﬁc
binding sites indicated that MYOD has more CAGQTG binding
sites (Fig. 4, B2), and MSC has more CAGCTGQ sites.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays conﬁrmed the predicted

3.3 Application to cell type speciﬁc accessible sites

Discriminative motif analysis can be applied to any high-
throughput sequence datasets besides ChIP-Seq data. We used
this method to identify key TFs that are involved in regulation of
cell type-speciﬁc chromatin remodeling using DNaseI hypersen-
sitivity data. We collected 211 DNaseI hypersensitivity datasets
from the ENCODE Web site. Combining highly similar ones
yielded 77 profiles. We deﬁned cell type-speciﬁc accessible sites

as the sites that are shared by 55 proﬁles. To predict motifs in
each set of cell type speciﬁc sites, we chose background as the
random sampling of the cell type-speciﬁc sites in all cell types
that do not overlap with the foreground. The predicted motifs
for a set of well-studied cell types are shown in Figure 5 (full
results in Supplementary Table S4). We found many key TFs
that are known to regulate the given cell type. For example, we
found motifs for Oct4 (annotated as Pou2f2), Sox2 and GC-rich
motifs that mimic KLF4 (annotated as MZFl and ASCL2) in
Nt2d1, an embryonic cell line. All these factors are well known to
be markers of cell pluripotency. We found motifs for IRFl in B
cells, a key factor for immune response. In various lymphocyte
cells, we found motifs for E2A (annotated as TCFE2A), Runx
and ETS family TFs (annotated as SPIB, ELF5, SFPIl), all of
which are critical immune system regulators. For various differ-
ential epithelial cells in kidney, colon, lung, breast, pancrease and
prostate, FOX family motifs are dominant and motifs for HNF
family are enriched in kidney and colon. Similarly, we found
significant enrichment of various Homeobox, NeuroD and
Zic2 motifs in nervous system and MyoD motifs in skeletal
muscle. A recent ENCODE study (Neph et al., 2012) used
motifs in curated databases or de novo predicted motifs to scan
accessible regions and compute enrichment in the given cell type.
We offer a more direct alternative by combining motif prediction
and discriminative analysis. The predicted motifs are conse-
quently optimized to highlight the distinction between fore-
ground and background, thus likely to be more informative in
this setting.

3.4 Motif signiﬁcance and sample size

We have shown that our method can discover biologically rele-
vant motifs in a wide range of biological samples and application
settings. Here, we also give evidence that the z—value calculated
by our software is a true indication of a motifs statistical signiﬁ-
cance, and that the method is robust to variation in sample size
and motif enrichment level. To quantify motif significance, we
use the z—value statistic from the logistic regression model as the
‘motif score.’ To test its validity, we performed the following
experiment on the MyoD ChIP-seq dataset: we randomly
sampled 1%4K sequences from the combined foreground and
background datasets and then randomly permuted the class
labels within each sample. We repeated the permutation
5 times. The z—values for all enumerated 6mers in each permuta-
tion are approximately normally distributed, as shown by quan-
tilequantile plots (Supplementary Fig. S5A), indicating an
accurate reﬂection of true statistical signiﬁcance.

To determine how the z-scores of enriched motifs change with
sample size, we plotted the distribution of z-values for all 6mers
using samples from 1 to 64K, and highlight CAGCT G, which is
identiﬁed as the most signiﬁcant 6mer using all the data.
CAGCTG is consistently the most signiﬁcant motif for each
sample size (Fig. 6A), and the motif score is linear with the
square root of the sample size (Supplementary Fig. S5B), in
accord with the central limit theorem. We also tested how the
motif scores correlate with motif enrichment level. For each sam-
pling with size from 1 to 64K, we randomly kept 20, 40 to 100%
of the original foreground samples and replaced the remaining
foreground sequences with background sequences while keeping

Fig. 5. Predicted motifs for cell type speciﬁc accessible sites. The full list is included as Supplementary Table S4

the original class labels. CAGCTG remains the strongest 6mer,
even at low foreground proportion and small sample size (Fig.
6B) and the motif score is roughly linear to the true foreground
proportion (Fig. 6C). Therefore, this method can robustly detect
a motif present in a small subset of foreground sequences.

Next, we examined the effects of peak width on motif predic-
tion. Besides the MyoD dataset, we also studied YYl ChIP-Seq
in Hl-hESC, using YYl as an example of degenerate motifs,
which are likely to be more sensitive to the choice of peak
widths. In each case, we started from the peak summits and
extended the peak to width ranging between 25 and 1600
bases. For the case of YYl, we did not have peak summits in-
formation, so we assumed that peak summits were in the middle
of the peaks. This seems to be a reasonable approximation
because the peaks were called by MACS, which assumes a sym-
metric distribution of reads at both sides of the binding sites. The
best matching motifs in each test are shown in Supplementary
Supplementary Figure S5C. For MyoD, the best matching motif
has maximum score at peak width of 200, which achieves the best
discrimination between foreground and background. At peak

width of 25, about half of peaks do not contain a consensus
motif because peak summits do not always indicates presence
of binding sites precisely. At peak width of 100, ~90% of
peaks contain a consensus motif. We also noticed that when
peak width increases from 25, 50 to 100, the motif PWM be-
comes more informative, gaining specficity at the ebox ﬂanking
region. This is probably because wider peaks increase the motif
occurences by chance. The method consequently fine tuned the
motif model to increase discrimination against background. For
the case of MyoD case, the method suceeded to ﬁnd the motif in
peaks as wide as 1600 bp. For the case of YYl, we predicted
YYl motif at peak width of 25 to 400, and the motif lost dis-
criminative power at peak width 800 and 1600 due to increasing
chance of random occurrence. The percent of peaks with the
motif ranges from ~10% at peak width of 25, and 58% at
peak width of 400, whereas relative enrichment stabilizes be-
tween 2- and 3-fold. Assuming uniform nucleotide distribution
of the genome, a 5mer motif occurs once approximately every
1Kb, which explains why we lost discriminative power at peak
width of 800. In summary, informative motifs can be predicted in

wide peaks, but keeping peaks with reasonable width is import-
ant for prediction of degenerate motifs.

Finally, we want to address the issue whether bootstrapping in
our reﬁnement step usefully combats over-fitting. We used the
CAGCTG example shown earlier in text and tested all extension
variants at position —1 using different numbers of bootstrap
replicates, sample sizes and motif enrichment levels. We com-
puted the standard deviation of scores for each variant based
on bootstraps. The distribution of standard deviation does not
change signiﬁcantly with number of bootstraps performed or
with the sample size (Supplementary Fig. S5D and E), but

correlate strongly with the motif enrichment level (Fig. 6D).
When enrichment level is low, the scores of better candidates
(based on datasets with the biggest sample size and highest en-
richment level) tend to be within conﬁdence interval of worse
candidates (Fig. 6E), in which case, based on t—test results, we
terminate the refinement process early. Therefore, the bootstrap-
ping technique guides motif reﬁnement to be more aggressive
when motif signal is strong, but conservative when motif signal
is low, effectively avoiding over-ﬁtting at reasonable cost.

4 DISCUSSION

The main challenge of traditional motif discovery is to increase
signal to noise ratio due to lack of power from small input
datasets. High-throughput datasets present different challenges:
besides scalability concerns, they are likely to produce large num-
bers of statistically signiﬁcant motifs due to the power of the
large sample size, many of which are hard to interpret. To ef-
fectively use the motif prediction results to guide further study, it
is important to understand the nature of these motifs and why
they are enriched. It is well understood that genomes are far from
random, which presents complicated higher order structure such
as dinucleotide sequence preference, repetitive sequences, nucleo-
some positioning signals and so forth. Genomic sequences in
promoters, which usually show enrichment of TFBS, also con-
tain different characteristics from other parts of genome such as
enrichment of CpG islands, common motifs for housekeeping
TFs and so forth. These factors can all cause certain sequence
patterns to be enriched in a given dataset. In addition, many
ChIP-Seq and DNaseI hypersensitivity studies suggest that TFs
tend to colocalize on a common set of accessible regions. It is
unclear if these TFs collectively determine the accessibility of the
given sites or some bind non-speciﬁcally at the accessible sites.
Discriminative motif analysis is a powerful tool to address
whether the predicted motifs are truly involved in the biological
problem under study by use of a rigorous control group, a meth-
odology frequently used in experimental design. The key to suc-
cess for this method is proper choice of background, which might
not be clear until we have a better understanding of factors that
affects binding of TFs. By examination of a large set of ChIP-Seq
proﬁles, we identiﬁed some common motifs for TFs in a certain
category. For example, TFs that bind predominantly in pro-
moter regions are likely to be associated with ETS, SP1 and
other GC-rich motifs, and TFs with most of sites in distal regions
tend to have enrichment of APl sites. To determine if the asso-
ciated motifs are truly speciﬁc to the given TFs, we can iteratively
test for potential biases as we ﬁnd them, each time making the
background as similar to the foreground as possible except for
the deﬁned difference under study. As accessible regions in the
given cell type can be Viewed as the union of all TFBS that are
associated with active chromatin in that cell type, they present
some generic features common to most TFBS and can serve as a
good background for comparison with adjustment to other bias.
Further, downstream analysis can be used to validate predicted
motifs. For example, direct TFBS should contain a clear DNaseI
digital footprinting signature (Neph et al., 2012) and be close to
the centers of ChIP-Seq peaks (Bailey and Machanick, 2012).
We noticed that stronger peaks tend to be associated with
stronger motifs, as measured by the PWM scores, particularly

for TFs with long motifs, which is consistent with the theory that
PWM scores roughly reﬂect the DNA/protein binding afﬁnities
in vitro (Stormo and Fields, 1998). In such cases, including
weaker peaks usually results in more permissive motifs, lacking
the full DNA specificity for the strong peaks. However, recent
work suggests that weak sites can be functionally important, e. g.
Prepl regulates temporal expression of Pax6 Via a pair of low
afﬁnity DNA binding sites during lens formation (Rowan et al.,
2010). Our previous work also suggests that although strong
peaks are more likely to be associated with gene regulation, the
peak strength is not deterministic of function (Cao et al., 2010).
Several rank-based motif prediction methods designed for pro-
tein binding microarrays used the binding afﬁnities measured by
probe intensities (Berger and Bulyk, 2009; Chen et al., 2007). Our
method provides support for sequence weighting, with which the
users have the ﬂexibility to put more focus on a subset of se-
quences. These methods including our own, however, still build a
single PWM motif to represent all binding sites, whereas some
weaker sites are functionally more important than others
with similar PWM scores. We think a mixture or higher order
model may be more appropriate, a direction for our future
investigations.

One key feature of our method and other discriminative motif
discovery tools is the support for comparison of two similar
proﬁles. By comparison of NeuroD and MyoD, two similar
bHLH proteins, we have shown that although shared core
eboxes are involved in activation of chromatin, speciﬁc eboxes
are more directly involved in activation of differentiation pro-
grams in neurogenesis and myogenesis, respectively (Fong et al.,
2012). Similar studies can be performed systematically to identify
delicate speciﬁcity for members of other protein families that
share almost identical motifs, such as the ETS and FOXO
families. Such studies may shed more light of their functional
roles and evolution of protein families in general. We have also
demonstrated its application to DNaseI hypersensitivity data to
identify key regulators involved in cell type-speciﬁc chromatin
reprogramming. We can further zoom in to compare more simi-
lar samples, such as two different differentiated epithelial cells,
or, before and after a certain treatment. By applying this ap-
proach systematically, we can gain deeper understanding about
cell lineage restriction and differentiation program.

(4) simulating additional covariates, if necessary;

(5) assigning an endpoint state to the individual using contributing
variables;

(6) if the number of cases and controls has been speciﬁed and has not
been met, accept the individual. Otherwise, reject and repeat until
the total numbers have been ascertained.

A binary endpoint is assigned to an individual using an approach
analogous to the logit model described by Wu et a]. (2011), where
trait or covariates contributes log-additively to the probability of the
endpoint, with user-speciﬁed background rate (010) for the population
prevalence. Users can also control how genetic variants relate to the
endpoint, i.e. through an intermediate trait or directly on the endpoint.
Simulated data are returned as pedigree, map and covariate ﬁles that are
compatible with the genetic analysis package, PLINK (Purcell et al.,
2007).

3.1 Benchmarking

I simulated 10000 individuals for three biomarker traitsihigh
and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and triglyercides
(HDL—C, LDL—C and TG, respectively%with between—trait cor—
relation determined from epidemiological observation (Emerging
Risk Factors Collaboration et al., 2009), using 139 variants with
175 variant to trait relationships (Global Lipids Genetics
Consortium et al., 2013). On an Intel Xeon E7—4870 Core
(2.40 GHz), it took 64s, with time scaling linearly by total
sample size (e. g. 20000 samples took 131 s on average) and vari—
ants (n = 70 variants took 31 s). Ascertainment generating 2000
affected individuals (10% population prevalence), with estimates
for LDL—C and TG to the endpoint from Voight et a]. (2012),
took 97 s.

3.2 Example: power calculations

In MR studies, one goal is to estimate the effect of the change
in a biomarker of interest to risk of a disease endpoint. Define ﬂ
as the causal effect of the biomarker on endpoint, and the null
hypothesis that ﬂ = 0. By selecting a genetic instrument that has
a strong, direct, and exclusive effect on the biomarker, ﬂ can be
estimated via instrumental variable regression or score—based
MR, generating a test statistic to evaluate if ﬂ is significantly
different from zero. A signiﬁcant test provides support for the
hypothesis that the biomarker is causally related to the endpoint
of interest (based on the genetic instrument that changes the
biomarker trait), and addresses issues of confounding and
reverse causality owing to random assortment of alleles at
meiosis. The mean of this statistic directly relates to the power
to discover a causal effect between a biomarker and the
endpoint.

Analytic power determined for a single marker on a binary
outcome has been described by Burgess (2014), by which the
simulation engine can be compared with. From there, equations
that incorporate multiple genetic instrumental variables with
differences in variance explained and in samples sizes at each
variant can be written (see Supplementary Note). Across L
total variants, for nf‘ cases and  controls and the variance of

the biomarker explained by the i—th genetic instrument (0%), the
log—odds causal effect of the biomarker on disease endpoint (ﬂ)
and the total variance of the biomarker explained by the genetic
instrument across all loci (02), the given test statistic under the
alternative is distributed with unit variance and a mean of:

 

. l nfl-l-niU.U' (1)
Results presented in Table 1 demonstrate that simulation closely
matches analytical expectations (Equation 1) for a single genetic
instrument, for multiple genetic instrumental variables assembled
into a single score—based MR analysis (Johnson, 2012) and, ﬁ—
nally, when the effect of the instrument and/or sample sizes also
vary. In all cases, the median estimates for the true, causal effect
(ﬂ) matched closely to that which was simulated (data not
shown).

3.3 Example: unweighted score statistics

I next compared the mean of the score—based MR test statistic,
without weighting on the biomarker effect. If the biomarker
effect is equal for all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
contributing to the score, the mean of the weighted and un—
weighted test is equal and matches analytical expectation
(Equation 1). If the biomarker effects are unequal, the un—
weighted test has slightly lower mean (Table 1, row 8 versus
10), consistent with previous observations (Burgess and
Thompson, 2013). If selected variants were subject to winner’s
curse, selected weights, in some cases, may be upwardly biased.

In this case, the unweighted statistic has slightly better perform—
ance (3.67 if unweighted vs. 3.51 if weighted). Thus, weighting
can improve the power of the test if modeled appropriately, while
tests without such weighting in some case provides a degree of
model robustness.

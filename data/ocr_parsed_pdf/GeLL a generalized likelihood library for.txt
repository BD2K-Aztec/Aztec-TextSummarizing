Abstract

Summary: Phylogenetic models are an important tool in molecular evolution allowing us to study
the pattern and rate of sequence change. The recent influx of new sequence data in the biosciences
means that to address evolutionary questions, we need a means for rapid and easy model develop—
ment and implementation. Here we present GeLL, a Java library that lets users use text to quickly
and efficiently define novel forms of discrete data and create new substitution models that describe
how those data change on a phylogeny. GeLL allows users to define general substitution models
and data structures in a way that is not possible in other existing libraries, including mixture mod—
els and non—reversible models. Classes are provided for calculating likelihoods, optimizing model
parameters and branch lengths, ancestral reconstruction and sequence simulation.

1 Introduction

Many studies in molecular evolution use phylogenetic substitution
models to infer patterns of change between homologous characters
using maximum likelihood (ML). These models allow us to infer
many valuable quantities, such as how the rate evolution varies
among sites or the selective pressures acting on codons (Yang, 2006).
The growing availability of genome sequences has led to new forms
of data, such as gene content and the presence or absence of pro—
moters (e.g. ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012), and their study re—
quires statistically rigorous inferential tools. Nearly all phylogenetic
substitution models are continuous time Markov chains with discrete
and finite state spaces, which require the same underlying computa—
tional machinery. General phylogenetic libraries, such as BEAST
(Drummond et (11., 2012), PLL (Flouri et (11., 2015) and Bi0++
(Guéguen et (11., 2013), take advantage of these similarities and allow
programmers to build phylogenetic models and are often the basis of
existing packages. Here, we present GeLL, a Generalised Likelihood
Library, which provides non—expert users a text interface to define

data and models, allowing users to create data structures and models
parameterizations that reﬂect the properties of their data. To aid in
characterization of these models, GeLL also allows users to perform
ML inference, simulate data and perform ancestral reconstruction.

2 Capabilities

GeLL is designed around the idea that phylogenetic models are
defined by three key components. The first component is a finite and
discrete character space used to define a data matrix, such as a nu—
cleotide sequence, counts of occurrences of gene family members in
genome or presence or absence of morphological characters in a spe—
cies. The second component is the instantaneous rate matrix of a
continuous time Markov process that describes the relative rates of
transition between characters in the model state space. These two
components are related by a function that maps each single element
of the character space on to one or more elements in the model state
space. The final component defines output, which allows users to

access information derived from the other two components. Figure 1
shows the major components of GeLL and how they link together to
perform phylogenetic analysis.

2.1 Data

GeLL allows users to define their own character space, which can be
any set of discrete characters for which users are confident of assign—
ing one—to—one homology. The user expresses these homology state—
ments through the equivalent of a multiple sequence alignment
conditioned on that character space, which in turn is input into
GeLL for computation. Data may be commonly used sequence char—
acter spaces, such as nucleotides or amino acids, or more unusual
characters, including genome size, gene family copy number or
ploidy number. A state may also contain groups of ‘characters’, such
as the three nucleotides in a codon. GeLL comes with classes to read
a traditional alignment (in relaxed Phylip and FASTA formats) or an
‘alignment’ of numbers (such as gene family size). The sites in an
‘alignment’ can be partitioned, so that each partition has its own
model and the parameters of that model may be shared between all
or subsets of partitions. The relationship between observed elements
of the character space and the elements used in the model space may
be straight forward, such as the direct mapping of ‘A’ in a nucleotide
character—space to an ‘A’ in the model state space. One may wish,
however, to include characters that represent uncertainty about the
observed characters, such as the use of ‘W’ to represent the weakly
bonding nucleotides AzT or work with covarion—style models
(Whelan, 2008), where an observed ‘A’ may map to both an ‘ON’
state or an ‘OFF’ state in the model. To accommodate these forms
of models, GeLL allows users to define the relationship between the
observed character space and the state space used in the model.

2.2 Models

The most important component of GeLL for many users will be the
Model class. Central to the definition of phylogenetic substitution
models (Yang, 2006) is the rate matrix, Q, that uses a set of param—
eters to define the instantaneous rate of change between any two
elements in the model state space. In Figure 1, for example, the nu—
cleotide HKY model is (Yang, 2006) defined through parameters
describing the relative rate of change of transitions to transversions
(k) and the stationary distribution of the nucleotides. GeLL allows
users to define this matrix through a two—dimensional array of
strings, with each string representing an equation consisting of par—
ameters and simple mathematical operators. Models may be both re—
versible and non—reversible, with the maximum size of the model
state space limited only by the computational resources available.
Models may also have multiple rate matrices, allowing users to cre—
ate complex mixture models, including models with multiple rate
classes (Yang, 2006), temporal hidden Markov models (Whelan,
2008) and structure—based mixture models (Le et (11., 2008).

To enable non—stationary models, GeLL allows users to define
the distribution of states at the root of the tree in one of four ways:
(i) through a string of character—states, such as a sequence; (ii)
through the stationary distribution of the rate matrix; (iii) through
the quasi—stationary distribution for models with a sink—state
(Darroch and Seneta, 1967) or (iv) through the method of Fitzjohn
et al. (2009), where root frequencies are proportional to the prob—
ability of that root assignment generating the data. We note that the
quasi—stationary distribution is new to phylogenetics, although it has
been used for modelling populations (Ovaskainen, 2002) and en—
demics (Nasell, 1996). To our knowledge, no other library allows

2.3 Output

GeLL provides a number of ways to study both a model and its ap—
plication to data. At the simplest level, GeLL allows the computa—
tion of the likelihood of an alignment given a parameterized
substitution model and a rooted or unrooted tree with branch
lengths using the pruning algorithm (Felsenstein, 1981). Model par—
ameters and branch lengths can also be estimated from sequence
data using ML. Given a set of model parameters and data, GeLL
can be used to simulated data or perform ancestral reconstruction
using either marginal (Yang et (11., 1995) or, in the case of non—
mixture models, joint reconstruction (Pupko et (11., 2000, 2002). To
aid the statistical comparison of models, there are also classes for
comparing models through the likelihood ratio test statistic
(Goldman, 1993), the Akaike information criteria (Akaike, 1974)
and the Bayesian information criteria (Schwarz, 1978). Classes are
also included that allow the comparison of models with different
state spaces using the method of Whelan et al. (2015).

2.4 Using GeLL

GeLL offers considerably different functionality than existing libra—
ries, such as Bio++ (Guéguen et (11., 2013) or packages, such as
HyPhy (Pond and Muse, 2005) and PAML (Yang, 1997). By allow—
ing users to define the character space of their data, the state space
of their model and how the two spaces interact, it allows complex
model specification outside the norms of phylogenetic inference, in
contrast to existing tools that are strongly linked to existing model—
ling approaches and structures. The generality of the model, includ—
ing the specification of non—reversible models and the root
distributions, also allows users to create novel and complex models
that cannot be implemented in existing packages. GeLL includes a
driver which allows many simple investigations to be completed
without the need for any programming. To further demonstrate the
functionality and utility of GeLL, we include as an example the
models described in Mayrose et al. (2010) to describe the evolution
of chromosome number. This implementation required fewer than
100 lines of code and around half an hour of programming.
A second example comes from our previous work, where GeLL was
used to model gene family evolution through a birth—death—innov—
ation model with an upper bound on family size (Ames et (11., 2012).

code new models to help users to become familiar with GeLL’s syn—

formance with other phylogenetic libraries and software packages

Abstract

Summary: We introduce PATH2PPI, a new R package to identify protein—protein interaction (PPI) net—
works for fully sequenced organisms for which nearly none PPI are known. PATH2PP| predicts PPI
networks based on sets of proteins from well—established model organisms, providing an intuitive
visualization and usability. It can be used to combine and transfer information of a certain pathway
or biological process from several reference organisms to one target organism.

Availability and implementation: PATHZPPI is an open—source tool implemented in R. It can be ob—

 

tained from the Bioconductor project: http://bioconductor.org/packages/Path2PPl/

1 Introduction

Plenty of databases exist which contain protein—protein interaction
(PPI) data for various organisms (e.g. Chatr—aryamontri et (11., 2015;
Franceschini et (11., 2013). For some well—established model organisms,
species—specific data repositories are available (e.g. Guldener et (11.,
2006; Prasad et (11., 2009) providing also PPI data. In contrast, for the
majority of organisms such a comprehensive amount of PPI data is not
available. Therefore, different approaches have been developed to pre—
dict PPIs. Some of these approaches aim to deduce new interactions
from known PPIs by means of homology—based mapping based on se—
quence similarity. Other methods apply supervised learning to filter
and score the predicted interactions, using additional biological data,
e.g. functional annotation, co—expression and / or text—mining data
(Yu et (11., 2010; for a recent review see Rao et (11., 2014). Approaches
that predict PPIs based on sequence data or network topology infor—
mation often provide only precomputed data (Franceschini et (11.,
2013; Pesch and Zimmer, 2013) or predict interactions only for a set
of predefined organisms (Deng et (11., 2013; Wiles et (11., 2010).
Furthermore, most of the methods do not supply information about

the underlying reference interactions. In the majority, only the scores
are provided to validate a predicted interaction. Often it is necessary
to easily access the entire underlying information about the predicted
interactions since the interpretation and experimental validation is one
of the most important steps after the prediction.

As we were interested in aging processes and interaction net—
works of age—related pathways in the fungal model organism
Podospora anserina (Osiewacz et (11., 2013; Philipp et (11., 2013), we
found only a few data repositories for interaction data. For example,
the KEGG database (Kanehisa et (11., 2014) provides small subnet—
works of some selected, mainly metabolic, pathways. Recently, also
the STRING database (e.g. Franceschini et (11., 2013) involves some
predicted interactions for Ranserina. Nevertheless, there was no sat—
isfactory solution and no easy and fast way to directly gain know—
ledge about proteins and their interactions of certain biological
processes, which are well established in some model organisms, but
nearly unknown in the target organism. Homology—based tools
which theoretically enable to predict or transfer interactions between
species are mostly implemented for a set of predefined organisms or

mal view). The edge thickness corresponds to the scores and the number of reference species showing the interaction. (b) Detailed view of the PPI network. Each
edge is specifically colored (see legend), indicating in which reference species this interaction occurs. Multiple edges represent multiple findings of an interaction.
That means, that e.g. the interaction of the proteins ‘BZAT71' and ‘BZAE79' was found six times in yeast (blue edges) and two times in human (green edges). (0)
Hybrid network representation of the predicted PPI: The relevant parts of the PPI networks of the reference species are included together with the predicted PPI
network of the target species. Interactions are depicted as solid lines in the respective color (see legend). Homologous relations of the reference proteins to those
of the target species are drawn as dotted edges in the respective color of the target node

require pairs of proteins in the target organism to decide whether
they may interact (Chen et (11., 2009; Murakami and Mizuguchi,
2014). Here, we report the implementation of PATHZPPI which helps
finding proteins and interactions of certain pathways or biological
processes in each fully sequenced organism without the need for pre—
definition of putative proteins and interactions.

2 Features

Using PATHZPPI, the user can choose up to seven of the most estab—
lished model organisms (human, mouse, rat, yeast, Ecoli, Celegans
and D.melanogaster). Based on sets of proteins from these reference
species PATH2PPI uses the interaction repository iRefIndex (Razick
et (11., 2008) to find the corresponding relevant interactions. We im—
plemented a more ﬂexible and comfortable search engine than pro—
vided by the iRefR package (Mora and Donaldson, 2011).
Additionally, PATHZPPI requires results of N CBI BLAST+
(Camacho et (11., 2009) searches of all reference species against the
target species. Based on these data, PATH2PPI computes new inter—
actions in the target species and scores them. The score is based on
the degree of homology and the number of reference species which
show the corresponding interaction. A major advantage of PATH2PPI
is the easy access to the underlying reference interactions, i.e. all in—
formation provided by iRefIndex, e.g. source database, interaction
type and reference publication. Based on the igraplo package (Csardi
and Nepusz, 2006) the computed PPI can directly be visualized in R
(see Fig. 1).

3 Implementation

PATH2PPI can be obtained from the Bioconductor project (Huber
et (11., 2015). It contains a comprehensive tutorial and for the case
study, data files necessary to predict interactions of the induction
step of autophagy in Ranserina by means of the corresponding PPIs
in human and yeast. There are three types of visualization methods
available, the normal, detailed and hybrid (Fig 1a—c). Additionally,
detailed information about each interaction can be obtained. Results
are provided as data frame or as igraplo objects, enabling for subse—
quent analyses in R or in advanced analysis tools like Cytoscape
(Cline et (11., 2007). Through the S4 class architecture PATHZPPI can

be easily extended by further prediction and validation algorithms.
The example depicted in Figure 1, the prediction algorithm and all
features of PATH2PPI are described in detail in the tutorial, see the
supplement and the corresponding Bioconductor web site.

4 Conclusion

We introduced a new R package to predict PPI networks based on
sets of proteins which may belong to a specific biological pathway,
providing an intuitive visualization and usability. We implemented
PATH2PPI to reveal putative proteins and interactions for a pathway
or a biological process in organisms for which nearly none PPI infor—
mation is available. The results can serve as starting points for fur—
ther network modeling studies and experimental validations.

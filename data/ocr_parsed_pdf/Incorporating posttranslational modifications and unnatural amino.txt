ABSTRACT

Motivation: Accurately predicting protein side-chain conformations is
an important subproblem of the broader protein structure prediction
problem. Several methods exist for generating fairly accurate models
for moderate-size proteins in seconds or less. However, a major limi-
tation of these methods is their inability to model post-translational
modifications (PTMs) and unnatural amino acids. In natural living
systems, the chemical groups added following translation are often
critical for the function of the protein. In engineered systems, unnatural
amino acids are incorporated into proteins to explore structure—
function relationships and create novel proteins.

Results: We present a new version of SIDEpro to predict the side
chains of proteins containing non-standard amino acids, including
15 of the most frequently observed PTMs in the Protein Data Bank
and all types of phosphorylation. SIDEpro uses energy functions that
are parameterized by neural networks trained from available data. For
PTMs, the X1 and X1+2 accuracies are comparable with those obtained
for the precursor amino acid, and so are the RMSD values for the
atoms shared with the precursor amino acid. In addition, SIDEpro
can accommodate any PTM or unnatural amino acid, thus providing
a flexible prediction system for high-throughput modeling of proteins
beyond the standard amino acids.

Availability and implementation: SIDEpro programs and Web server,
rotamer libraries and data are available through the SCRATCH suite of
protein structure predictors at http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/

1 INTRODUCTION

Post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) are critical to the func-
tion of many proteins in living systems, and understanding their
effects at the molecular level is important for both basic and
applied research in biology and medicine. To further this under-
standing, open databases of curated PTM information have been
published. For instance, Phospho.ELM (Dinkel et al., 2010) is a
publicly available database dedicated to phosphorylation. The
database provides the exact positions of experimentally deter-
mined phosphorylation sites as well as information on the spe-
ciﬁc kinases that produce the modiﬁcations. Other databases

such as PhosphoSitePlus, HPRD and PHOSIDA (Gnad et al.,
2011; Hornbeck et al., 2012; Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) include
information on additional types of PTMs (e.g. ubiquitination,
acetylation, methylation) but are still dominated by phosphoryl-
ation data. An automated curator of information on PTMs
(Khoury et al., 2011) found in Swiss-Prot (Bairoch and
preiler, 2000) provides the following summary statistics:
there are a total of 82505 PTMs determined by experimental
methods, with the following types having a frequency >1%:
phosphorylation, 70.9%; acetylation, 8.2%; N—linked glycosyla-
tion, 6.8%; amidation, 3.5%; hydroxylation, 2.0%; methylation,
1.9%; O-linked glycosylation, 1.4%; ubiquitylation, 1.1% and
pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, 1.0%.

In addition to methods for curating and organizing existing
PTM data, there are also methods for predicting which sites are
modiﬁed in sequences with unknown PTM status. These meth-
ods typically use supervised machine learning, statistical and
motif-based approaches to predict sites of phosphorylation
(Blom et al., 1999; Wan et al., 2008), acetylation (Li et al.,
2009), glycosylation (Hamby and Hirst, 2008; Julenius et al.,
2005; Li et al., 2006), sumoylation (Ren et al., 2009; Xu et al.,
2008) and less common types of PTMs as well (Plewczynski
et al., 2012). Some of these methods predict both the specific
phosphorylated sites and the specific kinases responsible for
the phosphorylation (Blom et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2004;
Obenauer et al., 2003).

In contrast with these approaches, the fundamental problem
of predicting accurate three-dimensional (3D) models of PTMs
in proteins has been largely ignored. None of the widely used or
recently published side-chain prediction methods that are free for
academic research (Hartmann et al., 2007; KriVOV et al., 2009;
Liang et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2008; Nagata et al., 2012; Zhichao
et al., 2011) are capable of incorporating PTMs or unnatural
amino acids into their predictions. The widely used template-
based modeling software Modeller (Sali and Blundell, 1993)
allows for manual creation of custom residues; however, the pro-
cess for doing so is somewhat cumbersome and not realistic for
most Modeller users. One notable exception is the incorporation
of non-canonical amino acids into Rosetta (Leaver-Fay et al.,
2011) for computational proteinipeptide interface design
(Renfrew et al., 2012).

The developers of side-chain prediction methods recognize the
need for generating accurate models that incorporate PTMs;
however, there are a number of practical challenges that have
stymied progress in this area: (i) there are far less data in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2002) for PTM

residues than native residues for building rotamer libraries or
developing statistical potentials; (ii) although one-character
codes (e. g. A for alanine) work well for efﬁciently deﬁning pro-
tein sequences, it is unfeasible to use one-character codes for all
possible PTMs (there are >100 PTMs documented in the litera-
ture); (iii) some important modiﬁcations (e.g. O—linked glycosy-
lation) correspond to broad classes of chemical structures rather
than a unique chemical structure, and each of the possible mol-
ecules would need to be uniquely identiﬁed; and (iv) modiﬁed
residues are generally larger and contain more rotatable bonds
than their natural counterparts.

Beyond the 20 standard amino acids and their PTMs, there are
also other natural or synthetic amino acids that can be incorpo-
rated into proteins. Two additional natural amino acids,
selenocysteine (Sec,U) and pyrrolysine (Pyl,O), are coded in
some species by codons that are usually interpreted as stop
codons. Pyrrolysine, for instance, is used by some methanogenic
archaea in enzymes used to produce methane. In addition, >40
unnatural amino acids have been incorporated into proteins
through synthetic biology projects, often by creating a unique
codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer RNA, to explore
protein structure and function and create novel proteins (Wang
et al., 2009; Xie and Schultz, 2005). A tool for modeling the side
chains of these rare natural or unnatural amino acids would also
be desirable.

Thus, despite the challenges described above, we have taken
on the problem of rapidly generating reasonably accurate 3D
side-chain models of proteins that incorporate amino acids
beyond the standard 20 amino acids. In the remainder of this
article, the term ‘non-standard amino acid’ (NSA) is used to refer
to any amino acid other than the 20 standard amino acids. This
includes PTMs, rare natural amino acids and unnatural amino
acids.

2 METHODS

2.1 Training and testing datasets

Because we use machine learning methods to predict the side-chain con-
formations of NSAs, we ﬁrst describe our curated datasets. We distin-
guish the 15 more frequent post-translational modiﬁcations (FPTMs)
from all the other NSAs because there are far more data available for
them in the PDB.

2.1.] N SA dataset The PDB assigns a three-letter identiﬁer to unique
chemical structures. The system is used for standard amino acids as well
as other chemical structures (e. g. ligands, NSAs) that have coordinates in
PDB ﬁles. To curate a set of NSAs observed in protein structures, we
started from a set of 1449 chemical structures identiﬁed as ‘non-standard
polymeric components’ by the PDB. From this starting set, we ﬁrst
removed molecules that were not amino acids, leaving 614 amino acids
after this step. Then, we downloaded all of the PDB structure ﬁles that
contained one or more of these 614 identiﬁers, yielding 12294 PDB ﬁles.
Next, we checked the integrity of the peptide backbone for each potential
NSA. If either peptide bond distance was >1.5A, a feature typically
observed with less-constrained amino acids located at the beginning or
tail of a protein, the NSA was excluded from the dataset, leaving 603
NSAs after this step. Next, we excluded any NSA that did not have at
least one standard amino acid adjacent to it in the peptide chain. After
this step, 549 distinct NSAs contained in 12045 PDB ﬁles remained. The
reason for this step was to exclude NSAs observed only in short peptides

composed exclusively of NSAs that are never observed integrated into
proteins. Then, we excluded NSAs that have no carbon y or multiple
carbon ys because only amino acids with a single X1 angle are considered
for the prediction stage. After this step, 459 NSAs contained in 11 543
PDB ﬁles remained. Next, we excluded proteins with NSAs with high
B-factors (>40) because of the uncertainty in the corresponding conform-
ations. Finally, we removed redundancy at the protein sequence level
using a sequence similarity threshold of 30% and set aside the data cor-
responding to the 15 most frequent PTMs (see next section on FPTMs).
The ﬁnal NSA (non-FPTM) dataset consists of 316 unique NSAs con-
tained in 1308 PDBs ﬁles. The NSA (non-FTPM) dataset is used exclu-
sively for estimating the generalization accuracy of SIDEpro (see below).

2.1.2 FPTM dataset Our main criterion for categorizing an NSA as
a PTM was that a substructure of the NSA must be one of the standard
20 amino acids. We sought to discover the set of PTMs with sufficient
instances in the PDB to allow for training and creating rotamer libraries.
For this purpose, we set a threshold of at least 50 instances. We sorted the
curated NSA dataset by the total number of times the NSA is observed in
the PDB. Multiple occurrences in the same PDB ﬁle were counted as
unique occurrences. After ordering the dataset, we observed that there
were 15 NSAs with >50 occurrences, and all of them were PTMs accord-
ing to our deﬁnition. Table 1 shows the chemical structures of the PTMs
and their precursor standard amino acids (e.g. tyrosine is the precursor of
phosphotyrosine) using the PDB atom naming scheme to label individual
atoms.

Selenomethionine (MSE) was associated with a particularly large
number of PDB ﬁles, and thus we selected 500 of them at random.
Finally, for each PTM, the corresponding ﬁles were split into ﬁve equal
folds for cross-validation purposes. The total number of PDB ﬁles in the
FPTM set is 1168. Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 contain summary
information for all the NSAs in the ﬁnal NSA and FPTM datasets,
including PDB three-letter codes, SMILES representations and the cor-
responding list of PDB ﬁle names. Supplementary Table S3 contains the
original training set for SIDEpro (Nagata et al., 2012).

2.2 Building rotamer libraries for NSAs

A ﬁxed rotamer is deﬁned by a speciﬁc set of X angles whose values are
typically equal to the mean of the values observed in a set of correspond-
ing side-chain conformations that cluster in 3D space. A ﬂexible rotamer
is deﬁned by both the means and variances of each one of its X angles.
Both types of rotamers are widely used in side-chain conformation pre-
diction, with rigid rotamer libraries (Bhuyan and Gao, 2011; Scouras and
Daggett, 2011) generally leading to faster, but slightly less accurate, al-
gorithms than ﬂexible rotamer libraries (Krivov et al., 2009; Lovell et al.,
2000; Nagata et al., 2012). Although several rotamer libraries have been
published for natural amino acids, only a few exist for NSAs (Gfeller
et al., 2012; Renfrew et al., 2012).

2.2.] Flexible rotamer library for FPTMS For 14 of the 15 PTMs
in this study, the atoms of the precursor amino acid that is being modiﬁed
are a subset of the atoms in the modiﬁed residue. The exception is
selenomethionine. Of the 14 FPTMs where the precursor atoms are a
subset, 12 introduce new rotatable bonds (i.e. additional X angles) that
must be dealt with. The two FPTMs with proline as the precursor are the
exceptions. For instance, serine (SER) has only one X angle, whereas
phosphorylated serine (SEP) has three X angles.

In Table 1, when FPTMs have additional X angles, the last X angle of
the precursor amino acid is highlighted in red, and the additional X angles
in the FPTM are highlighted in green. For instance, in Table 1 the last X
angle of serine, corresponding to the CA-CB bond, is highlighted in red.
The two additional X angles, corresponding to the CB-OG and OG—P
bonds in phosphoserine, are highlighted in green. Note that for
phosphotyrosine (PTR), with tyrosine (TYR) as the precursor, the ﬁrst

X angle is treated as the last X angle because the second (and ﬁnal) X angle
corresponding to the CB-CG bond is non-rotameric (Shapovalov and
Dunbrack, 2011).

The X angles present in the precursor will be denoted by XP, and those
that are additional in the modiﬁed residue by X“. To model the X angles
in FPTM residues that are present in the precursor residues (XP), a stand-
ard native amino acid rotamer library was used without modiﬁcation
(Shapovalov and Dunbrack, 2011). The additional X angles in X,I were
handled with a new customized method designed to accommodate cases
where only few training instances are available, relative to the case of
natural amino acids. For each FPTM type, except LLP and CME, we
placed each i-th X angle (Xm) in X,I into one of three angle bins: (0, 120°),
(120, 240°) and (240, 360°). We calculated the corresponding means p.23."
and standard deviations 0;? where r,,,- is a rotamer type for Xai. By assum-
ing that each X angle is independent, X,I can be assigned to a maximum of
R, = 3‘” rotamers (rotamers with zero counts are eliminated).

For symmetric bonds (O-P bonds in LLP, SEP, TPO and PTR;
CB-SG bond in OCS; NZ-C bond in KCX; and CE-NZ bond in
M3L), because their X angles are almost constant, we set their mean X

angle to 180° in the rotamer library. The X angles for PCA are also
constant, and thus we set X1 2 0°, X2 2 0° and X3 2 180° for PCA. In
all these cases, we set the standard deviations to a small default value
equal to 10°.

For LLP and CME, because they have many additional X angles and
more possible rotamers, we found that the prediction accuracy is lower
comparing with other FPTMs, when using the library deﬁned above.
Because of this, we decreased the number of possible rotamers by decreas-
ing the size of the bins. For LLP, the bins are (0, 120°) and (120, 360°) for
Xal; (0, 240°) and (240, 360°) for Xaz and Xa4; (0, 180°) and (180, 360°) for
Xa3; and a single bin (0, 360°) for Xa5. For CME, the bins are (0, 180°)
and (180, 360°) for Xal and Xaz; we treated Xa3 and Xa4 as ﬁxed bonds
with values 180 and 300°. These bins were determined from the empirical
distribution of X,.

We assume that X,I is dependent on the last X angle in XP, marked in
red in Table 1, and referred to as XP, km. This angle (XP, m) is associated
with one of three bins of equal size 120° as above. For each rotamer of
XP, m, we calculated the rotamer probabilities p(r,|r1,, m), where r,I is the
rotamer types for the additional X angles, and rp, 1a,, is the rotamer type

for XP, 1m. Because there are R, rotamers for the additional X angles in X,
and Rp rotamers for the precursor residue, the total number of rotamers
for a FPTM is R, x R1,, and the probability of combined rotamer (rp, r,)
is 171',” x p(r,|r1,, 1m) normalized by the sum of all R, x R], probabilities
where rl, is a rotamer for the precursor residue.

2.2.2 Restricted ﬂexible rotamer library for NSAS (non-
FPTM) Our approach to the generic prediction of NSAs, which do
not correspond to FPTMs, treats only the ﬁrst X1 (usually CA-CB) as
rotatable and considers the rest of the NSA structure as ﬁxed. We built a
general backbone independent ﬂexible rotamer library for the X1 angle
using the original SIDEpro training dataset (Nagata et al., 2012) (listed in
of Supplementary Table S3). First, the X1 angles for all natural amino
acids (except alanine and glycine, which have no X1 angle) in the training
set combined (not type speciﬁc) were calculated and placed into one of
three bins: (0, 120°), (120, 240°) and (240, 360°). The mean and standard
deviation of the X1 angles for each rotamer bin were calculated. By de-
fault, the values of the X,-, i 3 2 angles are ﬁxed to those of the original
NSA structure. If a user provides multiple structures for a given NSA,
SIDEpro automatically builds a uniform rotamer library for X,-,i 3 2.
For the SIDEpro Web server and downloadable program, we use the
COSMOS program (Andronico et al., 2011) for predicting the conform-
ations of small molecules to produce 10 conformations for each NSA that
is not an FPTM. The FPTM/NSA rotamer library is given in
Supplementary Table S4.

2.3 Training energy and prediction

To predict side chains, SIDEpro uses an additive energy function para-
meterized using a large number of neural networks trained from the data.
All the neural networks have similar structure with one input unit cor-
responding to a distance between a pair of atoms, one hidden layer of
hidden units and one linear output unit computing the corresponding
energy term.

2.3.1 Neural networks For natural amino acids, there are 156 neural
networks, one per amino acid type and per atom pair type. For instance,

the carbonwarbon neural network for valine computes the ‘energy’ con-
tribution associated with any pair of carbon atoms, where the ﬁrst carbon
atom is a non-backbone carbon atom in the valine residue under consid-
eration and the second non-valine carbon atom is contained in a spherical
neighborhood of 7A (this carbon atom could be on the backbone or side
chain of another residue or in a ligand). These neural networks are part of
the original SIDEpro program (Nagata et al., 2012); all the remaining
ones are new. For the most FPTMs, there are 130 new neural networks,
one per FPTM type and per atom-pair type. Thus, for instance, there is
one carbonwarbon neural network for phosphorylated serine. For NSAs
(non-FPTMs), we use a more generic approach with 25 neural networks,
one per atom pair type. Note that as a slight simpliﬁcation in all cases, we
consider only ﬁve atom types (C, H, N, O, S), treating P as if it were C
and using H only in the second position of an interaction.

2.3.2 Training The training pipeline is summarized in Figure 1. For a
given protein in the training set with a ﬁxed backbone, we initialize each
rotamer to the value closest to the native conformation. Then, we cycle
once through each protein in the training set from the C-terrninus to the
N-terrninus. When a given amino acid is being considered, we compute
the energy of all its rotamers using the corresponding neural networks.
These energies are converted into probabilities and then compared with
the native conformation. The mismatch information is used to adjust the
weights of the neural networks using Markov chain Monte Carlo meth-
ods [see (Nagata et al., 2012) for more details]. For NSAs (non-FPTMs),
we use the original SIDEpro training set (Supplementary Materials) of
252 proteins to train generic energy function neural networks using dis-
tances between pairs of atoms in all types of natural amino acids. The
SIDEpro training set has no redundancy, at the 25% sequence similarity
threshold, with the SCWRL4 (Krivov et al., 2009) test set. We experi-
mented with hidden layers of size 5, 10 and 15, noting in general, a deg-
radation of performance with 5, but only small differences between 10
and 15. In all cases, we selected the hidden layer size, which maximizes the
cross-validated accuracy (Supplementary Materials). Although we used
5-fold cross-validation to asses the approach, the ﬁnal production server
is trained on the entire data.

selecting the most likely rotamer and then going through a clash reduction algorithm

2.3.3 Prediction The prediction pipeline is summarized in Figure 2. In
prediction, we are given a protein with a ﬁxed backbone and possibly,
also a set of additional atoms with ﬁxed coordinates, which typically
correspond to ﬁxed side chains or atoms in ligand molecules. For the
remaining amino acids, we cycle through them in random uniform order
without replacement. Each amino acid has its own library of rotamers,
and rotamer probabilities as described in Section 2.2. This is true for
natural amino acids, FPTMs and other NSAs initialized uniformly
over 10 conformations produced by COSMOS. For a given non-ﬁxed
amino acid, we compute the expected energy of each one of its rotamers,
given all the other ﬁxed atoms, rotamers and rotamer probabilities. These
energy values are converted to probabilities, and the corresponding rota-
mer probability table is updated. The full cycle is repeated six times for
each protein.

It is important to note that the neural networks are used only once to
compute all the possible energy values because the set of all possible
pairwise distances, across all possible rotamer values, does not change
during the prediction phase. For the ﬁnal prediction, we choose the most
likely rotamer conﬁguration for each amino acid that is not ﬁxed by the
user. Finally, we run the same clash reduction algorithm as in (Nagata
et al., 2012).

3 RESULTS

We evaluate the approach using three standard metrics: (i)
RMSD for the side chain, which is calculated using the coordin-
ates of the experimental structure, exactly as described in (Krivov
et al., 2009); (ii) percentage of side chains where X1 is within 40°
of the experimental value; and (iii) percentage of side chains
where both X1 and X2 are within 40° of the experimental values.

3.1 Generic energy versus amino acid-speciﬁc energy

The generic neural networks and the corresponding energy can
ﬁrst be tested on the 20 natural amino acids and compared with
the amino acid-specific neural networks of SIDEpro.
Comparison of these two approaches on the SCWRL4 test set,
using the SCWRL4 rotamers (Krivov et al., 2009), are reported
in Table 2, with a summary for each amino acid of the RMSD,
the average X1 and average X1+2 and the corresponding P—Values
for a paired t-test on the RMSD. For each metric and each

P<0.15. When all amino acid types are considered as a single
large test set, the amino acid-speciﬁc neural networks produce
slightly more accurate models according to all three metrics with
high signiﬁcance (P< 0.001). For 10 amino acid types, the amino
acid-speciﬁc neural networks perform better than the generic
neural networks signiﬁcantly P<0.03. Note that the generic
neural networks produce better results for all three metrics for
tyrosine and phenylalanine and for at least one of the three met-
rics for four other residue types. However, these differences are
not statistically signiﬁcant because there is no amino acid type

3.2 Prediction of F PTMs

Here we compare the performance of the FPTM-specific neural
networks and the generic neural networks for the prediction
of FPTMs. One FTPM type, PCA, is excluded from the com-
parison because it has only one rotamer. We used 5-fold cross-
Validation on the FPTM datasets. Table 3 shows the average
number of atom pairs used for training the FPTM-speciﬁc
neural networks, the number of neural networks, the ratio of
these two numbers and the corresponding cross-validated
RMSDs and P—Values for a paired t-test on the RMSDs of
each fold. The best RMSD values are in bold together with
P<0.15. The number of training atom pairs divided by the
number of neural networks provides a rough estimate of the
number of examples used for training the neural networks of
each FPTM. For four FPTM types (LLP, MLY, PTR and
MSE), the FPTM-speciﬁc neural networks perform better than
the generic neural networks with signiﬁcance P< 0.15. These
four types correspond also to the four highest values of the aver-
age number of training pairs per neural network, excluding
KCX, which has a high P—Value. For all FPTMs, except OCS
and SEP, the speciﬁc neural networks perform better, although
the difference is small. In the final program, we use the speciﬁc
energy for all FPTMs.

Table 4 summarizes the cross-validated prediction accuracy
results for the FPTMs, grouped according to their precursor
amino acid, on the FPTM datasets. Each precursor amino acid
is shown in bold together with the corresponding SIDEpro

 

results. The table shows the average number of instances
observed in the test set for each of the 15 FPTMs as well as
the cross-validated results for the three accuracy metrics
(RMSD, X1 and X1+2). Two average RMSD results are presented
using: (i) only the atoms in common with the precursor amino
acid; and (ii) all the atoms. The former allows for a direct com-
parison with the accuracy of SIDEpro on the precursor amino
acid.

Considering the RMSD metric, and only atoms shared with
the precursor, the accuracy of the FPTMs is comparable with the
accuracy of SIDEpro on the precursor amino acids. Four PTMs
have lower mean RMSD than their precursor: KCX-lysine,
M3L-lysine, MLY-lysine and MSE-methionine. When all the
atoms in the PTM amino acid are considered, the average
RMSD results are significantly higher, as expected because
of the increase in size and number of rotatable bonds of
each PTM side chain with respect to its precursor amino
acid. Considering the X1 metric, six of the FPTMs have higher
accuracy values than their precursor amino acid: CSD-cysteine,
KCX-lysine, LLP-lysine, M3L-lysine, MSE-methionine and
PCA-proline. Six other PTMs have X1 accuracy that is within
10% of the corresponding precursor amino acid result.
Considering the X1+2 metric, only the PTMs associated with
lysine, tyrosine, methionine and proline can be compared. Of
the eight corresponding PTMs, where a direct comparison with
the precursor atoms can be made, four have higher accuracy
values than their precursor: KCX-lysine, M3L-lysine, MSE-
methionine and PCA-proline. In short, by multiple metrics, the

prediction accuracy of SIDepro on the 15 FPTMs is roughly
comparable with its accuracy on the natural amino acids.

3.3 Prediction of NSAs

The generic NSA prediction method requires a 3D structure
model of the NSA be provided as input, and to test the NSA
method with more data, we tested it on both the FPTM and the
NSA (non-FPTM) test sets. Structure models are derived from
two sources: (i) true structures from the PDB; and (ii) conform-
ations generated by COSMOS (Andronico et al., 2011). Results
obtained using true structures do not reﬂect what can be ex-
pected from prediction in a realistic setting, but rather provide
a sense of the limits of the methods. In true prediction mode, the
structure of the NSAs must be generated by a small molecule
structure predictor.

Table 5 reports the results of the generic NSA prediction
method on the FPTM set, when the FPTM amino acids are
treated as non-standard. The best results for each metric and
each FPTM are in bold. In this experiment, for each modiﬁed
amino acid, we use a single predicted structure obtained with
COSMOS. As shown below, further improvements can be ob-
tained by using multiple predicted structures. As expected, with a
few exceptions, when the true structures are used as input the
resulting models are more accurate than when predicted struc-
tures are used as input. Overall, the predicted structures lead to
reasonable performance, given the complexity of the problem
and the high-throughput nature of the approach. In all cases
using predicted structure leads to RMSD values that are
always < 2.5A on the shared atoms.

Finally, Table 6 summarizes the results obtained on the NSA
(non-FPTM) test set. For this experiment, we compare the re-
sults obtained using the true structure from the PDB, a single
predicted structure and multiple (10) predicted structures as

structural models for the NSAs. The best results for each
metric are shown in bold. As expected, using the true structure
provides the most accurate results, with an average RMSD of
1.75A and a X1 of 66.63%. Using multiple predicted structures
helps improve the performance. For instance, the average
RMSD improves from 3.54 to 3.08 A, a value that is reasonable,
given the high-throughput nature of the approach and the com-
plexity and variability of NSAs, but requiring further refinements
for high-precision tasks. In terms of the X1 metric, using 10 struc-
tures improves the performance from 56.39 to 65.30%, a value
close to the performance obtained using the PDB structures.

4 CONCLUSION

The strength of SIDEpro is that it uses the wealth of data in the
PDB to learn energy functions, parameterized by neural net-
works, to model and predict protein side-chain conformations.
In this study, we have extended the capabilities of SIDEpro to
PTMs and NSAs.

For natural amino acids and FPTMs, when sufﬁcient training
examples are available, SIDEpro uses amino acid-speciﬁc energy
functions. For all other PTMs and NSAs, SIDEpro uses a gen-
eric energy function. To ﬂexibly accommodate for any NSA,

Modeling of protein structures

 

SIDEpro allow users to provide 3D structures of NSAs to be
incorporated into SIDEpro models. Alternatively, the COSMOS
(Andronico et al., 201 1) program is used to predict these structures,
and any other similar program [e.g. OpenBabel (O’Boyle et al.,
2011)] can be used for the same purposes. The generic neural net-
works, trained on all possible pairs of atom types agnostic of resi-
due type, are used to score the atom7atom interactions for these
NSAs. Naturally, as more data on NSAs become available in the
PDB, it will be possible to further expand the set of speciﬁc energy
functions, thereby increasing the accuracy of the program over
time. As demonstrated here for some of the NSAs, accuracy can
also be improved by increasing the number of 3D samples pro-
duced by COSMOS, at the expense of time.

Finally, SIDEpro is to be used in protein structure prediction
and engineering projects for the rapid prediction of side-chains
conformations in high-throughput mode, or to provide good
starting points for molecular or quantum mechanics simulations
of side-chain atoms, for both standard and non-standard amino
acids.

Abstract

Motivation: Amyloids play a role in the degradation of ﬁ—cells in diabetes patients. In particular,
short amyloid oligomers inject themselves into the membranes of these cells and create pores that
disrupt the strictly controlled flow of ions through the membranes. This leads to cell death. Getting
rid of the short oligomers either by a deconstruction process or by elongating them into longer fi—
brils will reduce this toxicity and allow the ﬁ—cells to live longer.

Results: We develop a computational method to probe the binding affinity of amyloid structures
and produce an amylin analog that binds to oligomers and extends their length. The binding and
extension lower toxicity and ﬁ—cell death. The amylin analog is designed through a parsimonious
selection of mutations and is to be administered with the pramlintide drug, but not to interact with
it. The mutations (T9K L12K $28H T30K) produce a stable native structure, strong binding affinity to
oligomers, and long fibrils. We present an extended mathematical model for the insulin—glucose
relationship and demonstrate how affecting the concentration of oligomers with such analog is
strictly coupled with insulin release and ﬁ—cell fitness.

1 Introduction

Insulin and amylin molecules are co—secreted from ﬁ—cells in the pan—
creas to lower the concentration of glucose in the blood. Some of the
amylin misfold into amyloids and do not continue to carry on their
normal functions in the body. In type II diabetes, these amylin amyl—
oids are observed to form in the extracellular space surrounding
ﬁ—cells and build up into different sizes, some small (oligomers) and
others large (fibrils; MacArthur et (11., 1999). The exact effect of the
very large fibril deposits on the progression of diabetes and the in—
ﬂammation of ﬁ—cells is not really known. However, amyloid
oligomers have been clearly observed to be toxic, while the longer
fibrils are non—toxic (Meier et (11., 2006). These aggregates inject
themselves into cell membranes and create weakly selective pores

that introduce an uncontrolled inﬂux of ions into and out of the cell
(Lashuel et (11., 2002; Mirzabekov et (11., 1996). Their short length
allows for ions to pass through them easily, unlike fibrils. The inﬂux
of ions is mainly due to the high concentration gradient of calcium
molecules separating the cytoplasm and extracellular space. This
inﬂux disrupts cell coupling, impairs insulin secretion, depletes ATP,
depolarizes the membrane and weakens cells inducing apoptosis
(Ritzel et (11., 2007). Upon cell breakdown, the oligomers find other
live cells to target (Meier et (11., 2006). Figure 1 shows an illustration
of amylin oligomers permeating a cell membrane.

When too many amylin molecules misfold into amyloids, due to
insulin resistance and extreme pressure on the pancreas to secrete
insulin, the required levels of amylin in the body to modulate gastric

emptying and prevent postprandial spikes in glucose levels are not
met. This further complicates the conditions of type II diabetes
patients. Several injectable amylin analogs have been created in an
effort to find a suitable replacement for this lack of the necessary
levels of amylin. The most promising one, pramlintide, is an analog
containing 3 proline substitutions at positions 25, 28 and 29, and
reveals a weak tendency to aggregate (Cort et 41]., 2009). Pramlintide
is an effective amylin replacement agent that acts as a synergetic
partner to insulin (Riddle et 41]., 2007). Pramlintide does not enter
the cells of the pancreas; however, it moves through the circulatory
system to reach necessary organs and compensates for the lack of
sufficient amylin levels.

Although pramlintide has a weaker tendency to aggregate, and
compensates for amylin’s lost functions, it does not solve the prob—
lem of amyloid oligomer toxicity. The inhibition of the amyloid pro—
duction has been studied as a way to elongate cell life in diabetes.
Molecules like rifampicin have been designed to prevent fibril for—
mation (Tomiyama et 41]., 1997), but failed to remove the short toxic
oligomers that speed up the death of cells (Meier et 41]., 2006). Other
attempts at designing inhibiting molecules include the red wine
compound resveratrol (Mishra et 41]., 2009), Vanadium complexes
(He at 411., 2014), Polyphenols (Porat et 41]., 2004, 2006),
selenium—containing phycocyanin molecules (Li et 41]., 2014) and
N—methylation of amylin (Tatarek—Nossol et 41]., 2005). Many of
these molecules presented strong inhibiting results that lower the
rate of oligomerization in vitro and are currently undergoing more
experimentation. However, none of them are at a stage of being
produced as a therapeutic agent.

In this work we explore a different technique to reduce the tox—
icity of oligomers. Instead of inhibiting fibril extension, we promote
it. At a higher rate of amyloid aggregation, longer structures are cre—
ated. The higher the rate, the lower the concentration of oligomers

and the higher the concentration of fibrils. We aim to achieve this
high aggregation rate by constructing a molecule that when injected
into the human body, binds to these short oligomers and extends
their length, promoting aggregation and forcing them into long non—
toxic fibrils. A circumspect approach to create such molecule that
does not perform unknown and undesirable interactions in the body
is to engineer the molecule as an amylin analog with a parsimonious
selection of mutations to perform the task. We construct this mol—
ecule as an analog of high amyloidogenicity, to have very strong
binding affinity to the amyloids, and to have an extremely low dis—
sociation rate. The low dissociation rate is essential in preventing
the emergence of more short oligomers through fibrils breaking up.
This analog is designed to be administered with the pramlintide
drug in a native, non—amyloid form. The analog is engineered to
have a low binding affinity to pramlintide to prevent inducing
pramlintide to misfold. To conserve structure, the analog is designed
through a parsimonious selection of mutations. Moreover, we com—
pare the aggregation potential and stability of our top findings with
state—of—the—art tools [FoldX (Schymkowitz et 41]., 2005),
Zyggregator (Tartaglia et 41]., 2008), PASTA (Walsh et 41]., 2014)
and TANGO (Fernandez—Escamilla et 41]., 2004)] to increase confi—
dence in our selection.

2 Approach

Ridding the pancreas from toxic, short amyloid oligomers will re—
duce ﬁ—cell death. In theory, we could remove these oligomers in
three ways:

1. Altering the environment around amyloids to reduce the rate of
nucleation and inhibit oligomerization.

2. Designing molecules that bind to the ends of oligomers to stop
the ﬂow of ions through pores and to inhibit amyloid extension.

3. Promoting amyloid extension and ﬁbril growth to reduce oligo—
mer toxicity.

In this work, we develop a novel method to assist researchers
with solutions 2 and 3. Although we do not focus on exploring mol—
ecules to inhibit amyloid growth, our work will show how the
method could be used to assess the binding preferences and affinity
of amyloids to other molecules. In particular, we use the method to
improve the binding of amylin amyloids to other amyloids, stimulat—
ing growth and extension. Promoting amyloid extension forces
oligomers to grow into fibrils and decreases their toxicity.

Amyloids inherently bind to each other. They have a strong af—
finity to aggregate. Introducing the right amino acid mutations into
amyloids can increase their binding affinity and likelihood to aggre—
gate. This increase results in longer structures, forcing short oligo—
mers to grow into fibrils. The binding affinity scoring matrix
(BASM) method we introduce in this article explores the affinity of
amyloid residues to all possible amino acid bindings. We explore the
effect of pairing a single amino acid with an amyloid structure at a
specific residue position. For each of the residue positions of an
amyloid, we generate 20 binding affinity readings, one for every pos—
ition and amino acid pair, as illustrated in Figure 2. The affinity
measures the Lennard—Jones potential between the amino acid and
the amyloid structure, the Coulomb interactions, and the Solvation
energy of the system. We organize the readings into a n X 20 matrix.
The first dimension of the matrix comprises 20 amino acids, the se—
cond dimension is the protein residue positions, and each record is
what we call an R—score. The lower the R—scores, the stronger the

binding affinity between an amino acid and the amyloid structure at
the specific residue position.

The goal behind the BASM method is to identify bindings that
increase affinity. The best structure bindings could be used to engin—
eer an amylin analog that produces amyloids that bind better to the
ones in the pancreas. If designed with the proper amyloidogenicity,
the engineered analog will not only bind well to oligomers, but will
also promote amyloid extension. This extension reduces oligomer
toxicity and [f—cell death.

The analog can be administered in native, non—amyloid form
with pramlintide injections. In its native form, it will carry out the
normal functions of amylin and pramlintide. Once it reaches the
pancreas (through the bloodstream) and makes contact with the
amyloids, it should misfold and aggregate with the surrounding
amyloids and oligomers due to its high amyloidogenicity. To prevent
any potential aggregation with pramlintide, the analog is designed
with lowest affinity to pramlintide. In the Methods section we ex—
plain in detail how we develop this analog by generating the BASM
R—scores for amylin and pramlintide amyloids.

3 Methods
3.1 BASM R—scores

The free energy of a system, FE, that includes an amyloid protein
and an amino acid separated far apart from each other can be given
by,

FE : (LIP + Coulp) + (Lja + Could) + S (1)

where L] is the Lennard—Jones potential, Coul is the Coulomb en—
ergy, and S is the solvation energy of the entire system. The terms
with a p subscript denote the energies of the amyloid protein and the
terms with an a subscript denote energies of a separate amino acid.
If we alter the system such that we place the amino acid in close
proximity to the protein to interact with it, the free energy becomes

FE : (L],, + Coulp) + (L], + Could) + (L1,, + Coulap) + 8,, (2)

where Ljap and Coulap are the Lennard—Jones and Coulomb terms
resulting from the interaction of the atoms of the amino acid with
the atoms of the protein, respectively. Sap is the solvation energy of
the coupled system. Subtracting Equation (2) from (1) yields the

residue binding affinity, R, of the amino acid to the protein at the
position it was coupled at and gives,

R : L1,, + Coulap + 5,, — S (3)

or in more formal terms,



i:1 j>i (4)
N1 N2 q-q-

where N1 are the atoms of the amino acid and N2 are the atoms in
the protein. 6 is the depth of the Lennard—Jones potential well, a is
the finite distance at which the inter—particle potential is zero, r,-,- is
the distance between the protein atoms 1' and j, and q,- and q,- repre—
sent the charges of the two atoms. The solvation terms are given by

the system with solvent concentration set to zero, a3 is the lattice grid
size volume of the solvent, k]; is the Boltzmann constant, T tempera—
ture in Kelvin, and r is the surface definition, solvent—accessible surface
probe. The lower the R—scores, the stronger the binding affinity of an
amino acid to a particular position within the protein.

3.2 BASM matrix

Let M be the set of canonical amino acids given by,
M : {A1R1N1D1C1Q1E1G1H111L1K1M1F1P131T1W1Y1V} (6)

we construct a protein’s residue— BASM using the R scores in
Equation (4). In particular, for every residue position i of a protein
17, we compute twenty R scores, one for each m E M computed with

BASMji,mj :R(N,,,Nm), 1§i§n,m EM (7)

To physically model this system where we have an amino acid inter—
acting with the amyloid, we start with a PDB of dimer amyloid

structure. We mutate an amino acid in one of the amyloid structures
using SCWRL (Wang et al., 2008), and remove all the non—mutated
amino acids from that amyloid. This leaves an amino acid placed on
top of an amyloid monomer at the right binding distance.

3.2.1 Binding affinity function

Let S be the sequence of amino acids representing a protein with
length n such that S E M" and B the residue BASM of sequence S.
We compute, F(R), the global—sequence binding affinity function of
B to a sequence of amino acids R E M” by,

F<R> 2 flat/2.1%.] <81
k:1

where Rk is an amino acid at position [2. We can also compute par—
tial—sequence binding affinities of B to R and point—binding affinity
functions by,

k:z
F(R)k : Elk) Rial (10)

respectively. 1' and j are the starting and ending amino acid positions
of subsequences S and R.

To construct a sequence S” with optimal BASM binding affinity
to S, we must find F(S”) such that

F(S*) : minF(R), v12 6 M” (11)

Because the values in a BASM matrix are independent of one an—
other, F(S”) can be computed by

and the sequence S f can be constructed by,
5::S:_,+],-, 19:7; (13)
where j,- E M and j,- satisfies

Bji,],-] :minBli,/'], 19'3" (14)
[EM

3.2.2 Finding best fit to amylin and worst to pramlintide

Let B1 be the BASM of the amylin sequence S1 and B2 the BASM of
the pramlintide sequence S2. To construct a sequence with strong
binding affinity to the sequence of amylin amyloids S1 and simultan—
eously weak binding affinity to pramlintide amyloid sequence S2, we
generate a BASM B that satisfies this constraint and combines B1
and B2 in the following way,

Eszl—ﬁwz (15)

where 06 and [f can be considered as amyloid and pramlintide affinity
coefficients, respectively. Because we aim to find a binding sequence
that produces very stable bonds with amyloids and simultaneously,
very unstable bonds with pramlintide, setting %: 1 generates a B
with amino acid affinities that prefer amylin amyloids as much as
they repel pramlintide. Similarly, choosing a > 1 results in a se—
quence that binds better to amylin amyloids and repels pramlintide
less.

If we let F be the sequence binding affinity function for
B, we can construct S” for this system by using Equations (12)—(14).

S 8 might contain 1 to n differences in amino acids compared to amy—
lin’s sequence, S1. However, too many differences in amino acids
might create a structure that differs from amylin and does not bind
to the amyloids. To guarantee that we have a sequence that repre—
sents a structurally conserved, folded amylin analog, we will restrict
the number of possible differences between S” and S1. Using S”, we
will construct a parsimonious sequence SP.

If we allow for only 1 difference in sequence between S” and S1,
we can generate a 1—residue parsimonious sequence SP1 such that,

as“) =1r<r1iign{F(Sl)1,-_1 +F<s*>,- + F(Sl).-.1,,} (16>

where F is the sequence binding affinity function for B1 and
SP1:S1S§~-S}_1S;‘S}+1~-S}, (17)

where l is the i value that returns the minimum in Equation (16). We
can generalize Equation (16) to allow for k differences in sequence
between S” and S1 and generate a k—residue parsimonious sequence
Si by solving

1 * 1 1

where 11,12, ...,lk are the i values that solve for the minimum in
Equation (18). Applying the BASM technique on amylin will gener—
ate an optimal binding sequence for chosen at and [i values. Ensuring
a parsimonious selection of mutations increases the complexity of
the problem and reduces the optimality of the binding affinity for
amyloids. Nonetheless, this reduces the risk of losing structure and
function.

3.3 Amyloidogenicity

In solving for the minimum binding score in Equation (18) for amy—
lin, we pick the top 10 results (Table 2). Out of the 10 results, we
pick the one that has the highest potential to misfold into amyloids
and has the lowest dissociation potential. The higher the amyloido—
genicity, the more likely the analog will misfold in the presence of
amyloids and aggregate. The lower the dissociation, the less oligo—
mers will form out of the analog. We estimate a lower bound on
amyloidogenicity by calculating AG, the difference in energy (LJ,
Coulomb and Solvation) between the amyloid and native forms as
follows,

AG : Eamyloid _ EnatiI/e (20)

Although AG does not reﬂect the true energy barrier between native
and amyloid form, we use it to estimate a lower bound on the energy
needed for a structure to misfold.

3.4 Oligomer concentrations

Out of the set of solutions for Equation (1 8) we choose the parsimo—
nious solution that has the lowest dissociation potential, producing
the lowest number of oligomers. For each solution, we measure the
concentration of oligomers they might create. We can quantitatively
express these concentrations by computing the free energies of the

112 /310'slcumofp1q1xo"sotJBurJOJutotq/ﬁduq 11101} pQPBOIII/lAOG

oligomers. The expression for the concentration of these structures
in terms of the chemical potential of the system 11, the free energies
of oligomers F12, and the number of monomers k at each state can be
computed by the law of mass action.

Let’s denote by N the initial number of proteins in the solution,
V the volume of the system, Nk the number of oligomers of type [2.
Let a3 be the volume of a protein. The initial volume fraction <1) of
the proteins is defined by (1) : Na3 / V : M3 where c : N / V is the
initial concentration of proteins and the volume fraction of the
oligomers of type [2 by (1);, : Nkka3/V. Note that all (1);, and (1) must
be positive and smaller than 1.

The partition function of the system is written as

Z : e‘ﬂF

where l)’ : 1 /(k3 T) is the inverse temperature and F is the total free

3.5 Molecular dynamics (MD) and energy

minimization (EM)

We used the GROMACS 4.5 (Pronk et al., 2013) molecular simula—
tion package to run MD and EM simulations. Our mutant molecules
were solvated in a cubic box (with a minimum distance of 35  from
any edge of the box to any atom) and neutralized with chloride ions
and modeled using the GROMOS96 5 3a6 force field along with the
SPC water model. We used a cutoff of 10 Afor van der Waals and
short range electrostatic interactions, and calculated long range elec—
trostatic interactions using a particle mesh Ewald sum (Darden
et al., 1993; Essmann et al., 1995). Simulations were prepared for a
full MD run in both isothermal—isobaric (100 ps) and canonical
equilibration (100 ps) ensembles. Temperature and pressure were
controlled at 300 K and 1 bar using the velocity rescaling thermostat
and the Parrinello—Rahman barostat, respectively. A linear con—
straint solver was used to keep all bonds at their equilibrium length.

One million time steps were used with an integration time step of 2
fs. The system’s coordinates were saved every 10 ps for further
analysis.

3.6 Dipolar water solvent

We resort to our previous work in (Smaoui et al., 2013) to calculate
the Free energy of protein aggregates and plot Figure 3. In particu—
lar, we compute a Lennard—Jones, Coulomb and Solvation energy
terms. The Solvation term is computed using a fast and detailed di—
polar water model that solves the dipolar nonlinear
Poisson—Boltzmann—Langevin equation. The three energy terms are
used to describe the stability of molecular forces in molecules.
Solvation energy was precisely calculated using the AQUASOL rou—
tine (Koehl and Delarue, 2010) with the following setup: atomic
charges and radii assigned with PDB2PQR using CHARMM force
field at neutral pH. A grid or 257 points per edge spaced by 1 A, a
temperature of 300 K, and a solvent accessible surface with an
Rprobe of 1.4  All hydrogen—bonds were optimized. We used a tri—
linear interpolation protocol for projection of fixed charges on the
grid, a lattice grid size for the solvent: a : 2.8 A, solvent made of di—
poles of moment p0 : 3.00D at a concentration of Cdip : 55 M. No
salt was added to the solution and small ions were used to equili—
brate the system when needed. The electrostatic potential was set to
zero at the boundaries, and the stopping criteria for residual was
sent to: 1.10‘6 (when possible).

3.7 Building oligomer structures

The 3D structures (PDB files) are required in the process of assessing
the concentration of oligomers produced by a particular analog. To
create the 3D oligomers for amylin, we start with the amylin PDB
structure solved by Wiltzius et. al (2008) and use SCWRL (Wang
et al., 2008) to perform the necessary mutations introduced in each
analog. The mutated structure is then used by the CreateFibril tool
(Smaoui et al., 2013) to construct the oligomers with the following
parameters: 8° rotation angle, 5 .0A between monomers, and a fibril
packing distance of 3 units.

3.8 The effect of amyloid oligomers on the
insulin—glucose system

The process of response to glucose intake in the human body is com—
plex. Many factors determine how the pancreas responds to such
stimulus. The natural hereditary reaction would be to release
enough insulin into the bloodstream to signal other organs to con—
sume the glucose. The following system is the basic insulin—
glucose model proposed in 1961 by (Bolie, 1961)

dG
E:q—yr—(SG (28)

where G is the level of glucose in the blood, I is the level of insulin
released from the pancreas and the rest of the variables are coeffi—
cients that were determined experimentally. This model is a high
level representation of the normal production of insulin in healthy
patients.

To capture the effect of amyloids on the insulin—glucose relation—
ship and to incorporate the effect of oligomers on [f—cell death, we

Methods section and described how they can be used to engineer an
injectable amylin analog that binds well to amyloids in the pancreas
while preventing pramlintide from misfolding. Supplementary

positions of amylin amyloid, and Supplementary Table S2 shows the

the sequence S 8 with optimal binding affinity to BASM B for various
06 and [i values. Setting a fixed I} : 1 value and increasing 06 doesn’t
drastically change the sequence S”, suggesting that the residues of S”
possess a strong binding affinity to amylin. We proceed with se—
quence S” generated by 06 : 2 and l)’ : 1. This sequence encompasses
a binding affinity to amylin that is twice as large as the repelling
forces to pramlintide.

4.1 Constructing optimal binding analogs

As explained in the Methods section, S” will naturally have a low se—
quence similarity to amylin. To construct an amylin analog that is
structurally conserved and binds well to amylin amyloids and ex—
tends the length of oligomers, we’ll introduce some of the amino
acid variations from S 8 into the analog. To introduce a parsimonious
selection of variations to the amylin sequence, we solve Equations
(18) and (19) for a 4—residue parsimonious sequence. The assump—
tion we make here is that the binding affinity effect of separate pos—
itions are additive. This should hold for residues that are not
adjacent. We rank all the possible SP4 mutation combinations ac—
cording to their global binding affinity values and organize them in
Supplementary Table S4. The top 10 results are shown in Table 2.
For each of the top 10 results, we calculate their AG values using
Equation (20) to obtain a lower—bound on their amyloidogenicity
potential. All of the AG values are positive, indicating that the ana—
log will not spontaneously misfold. Their stability is expected to be
similar to amylin because of the similarity in AC values. The global
binding affinity score for the top 10 results are almost twice that of
an amylin amyloid, suggesting that the binding between an amyloid
and one of these analogs will be twice as strong as the binding be—
tween two amylin amyloids. We used TANGO (Fernandez—
Escamilla et al., 2004), FoldX (Schymkowitz et al., 2005),
Zyggregator (Tartaglia et al., 2008) and PASTA (Walsh et al., 2014)
to explore the native stability and amyloidogenicity potential of
these 10 sequences (see Supplementary Tables S3—S6). TANGO re—
ported that all sequences were predicted to create beta—strands, were
predicted to not form any alpha—helices, and expressed an extremely
high propensity for aggregation. Both FoldX and Zyggregator report
that the 10 results are stable in native form and possess a high aggre—
gation propensity. Interestingly, PASTA predicts the m9 mutant to
be closest in alpha—helix propensity to the native non—mutant, yet
simultaneously amyloidogenic. These comparisons with the state—of—
the—art tools support the high values of AG in the top 10 parsimoni—
ous sequences. Several other tools such as AmyloidMutants
(O’Donnell et al., 2011) and BetaScan (Bryan et al., 2009) could
also be used to further compare the sequence stability of the
findings.

4.2 Oligomer concentrations

The F (SP 4) values in Table 2 give good binding affinities to the amyl—
oids. In addition to a strong binding affinity, the analog must form
long fibril structures. We built the aggregate structures for all ten re—
sults and computed their free energies (Equation 1) in Figure 3. We
observe that all the ten sequences in Figure 3 produce more stable
oligomers than the amylin amyloid, suggesting that they would form
longer aggregates since it is energetically favorable to do so. To de—
termine the S“ that generates the highest potential to form long ag—
gregates, we compute molecule concentrations (Equation 27) by the
law of mass action and report the volume fractions of oligomers at
various lengths in Figure 4. The sequence that ranked 9th in Table 2
expressed the most stability in Figure 3 and dominated the volume
fractions in Figure 4 at oligomers of size greater than 7. This sug—
gests that this sequence creates the longest aggregates out of the 10
results. The longer it is, the more stable it gets. In contrast, we ob—
serve that the SP“ ranked 10th in Table 2 would create many short
oligomers of length 4 compared to the ten sequences. It is also worth
mentioning that the most stable amyloid SP4 monomer is produced
by the sequence ranked 1. In Figure 4 we see that this sequence dom—
inates the concentrations at length 1 but does not have a strong af—
finity to aggregate when compared to the other sequences.

4.3 Maintaining native form

Introducing four mutations to the sequence of amylin might desta—
bilize it and force it to misfold. To ensure that the (T9K L12K S28H
T30K) mutation preserves amylin structure and does not induce
pramlintide to misfold, we ran an MD simulation of 6ns on this
amylin mutant. We report in Figure 5(a) and (b) the RMSD and

Fig. 4. Concentration of oligomers in solution

RMSF graphs, respectively. The RMSD graph shows low values
(<1), indicating that the mutant structure is very stable. From the
RMSF graph, we see that the positions 9, 12, 28 and 30 that corres—
pond to the mutations all have low RMSF values, indicating that the
mutations do not cause structural turbulence and are not disadvan—
tageous to amylin. This preservation of structure should preserve
amylin’s functions.

5 Discussion

5.1 Binding to oligomers

It is a challenging and computationally intensive task to find a mol—
ecule A that binds well to a molecule B or subregions of B. One can
perform docking simulations with millions of molecules to narrow
the search of finding a good fit. In this work, we introduced the
BASM method of calculating binding affinities of optimal sequences
to cut down on this search process and analyze the binding prefer—
ences of B, or subregions of B. This procedure allowed us to explore
engineering analogs that bind strongly to oligomers and promote
their aggregation.

Applying the BASM method to engineer an amylin analog that
can be administered in native, non—amyloid form with pramlintide
injections resulted in discovering a mutant (T9K L12K S28H T30K)
that is predicted to bind twice as strong to oligomers as amylin does
to oligomers. This has been achieved by computing R—scores that
bind well to oligomer surfaces and repel from pramlintide’s amyloid
surface (Table 1). Using the optimal sequence constructed by these
R—scores, we searched through 66 thousand combinations of parsi—
monious mutations to find the mutant with optimal binding and ag—
gregation potential. This aggregation potential was both assessed by
the dipolar solvent model from (Smaoui et al., 2013) and by

TANGO (Fernandez—Escamilla et al., 2004). Furthermore, we vali—
dated the stability of the mutant in native form by performing an
MD production of 6 ns. The results showed that the mutant was sta—
ble in native form, and hence could be a potential candidate for
therapeutic injections.

The function of the mutant is intended to reduce oligomer tox—
icity and decrease the rate of [f—cell death. The mutant is stable in na—
tive form, and forms long fibrils in amyloid form. Since its native
structure is conserved and is analogous to amylin, it will carry out
the normal functions of amylin and pramlintide. By design, the ana—
log has low affinity to pramlintide and should not interfere with its
function. It will act as a replacement to amylin molecules and modu—
late gastric emptying, inhibit glucagon, and induce satiety (Lutz
et al., 1995; Rushing et al., 2000).

Once the mutant analog reaches the pancreas and makes contact
with the amyloids, some of it should misfold and aggregate with the
surrounding amyloids and oligomers, due to its relatively high AG
(amyloidogenicity potential). Although long fibrils have not been
observed to be toxic in the pancreas, the pharmacological effect of
elongating the oligomers still needs to be further studied. If very
long fibrils are observed to be unfavorable, controlling aggregation
and capping the growth of oligomers at a certain length will be
required and can be achieved by choosing mutants that exhibit
lower oligomer concentration potentials or regulating the dosage of
the injectable analogs in the body. The contribution of the BASM
approach and R—scores to limit the toxicity of oligomers by favoring
aggregation could be extended to explore creating potential thera—
peutic analog candidates for other amyloid related diseases such as
Huntington and Parkinson’s.

5.2 Modeling the effect of oligomers on the
insulin—glucose relationship
Upon having a meal, glucose levels increase in the bloodstream.
The increase in levels signals the [f—cells in the pancreas to produce in—
sulin to instruct body organs such as the heart and muscles to absorb
and metabolize glucose. This process lowers the glucose level in the
blood. The amylin polypeptide is also secreted with insulin in this pro—
cess at a ratio of 1:100 (Westermark et al., 2011). Together, amylin
and insulin play a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis.
Several mathematical models have been proposed to represent the
complex process of response to glucose intake (Boutayeb and
Chetouani, 2006). However, to date, no model has incorporated

the production of amyloids and the effect of oligomers on [f—cell death.
We think that by taking into account the observed effect of oligomers
on cell death the analytical solution of insulin in Equation (29) intro—
duced by (Bolie, 1961) will be the one presented in Equation (31).

We introduce a 0 and R function into Equation (31), where 0 is
the over burden term expressing how cells produce more insulin to
compensate for their dead neighbors and R is the number of dead
[f—cells in the pancreas at time t. The (1 — %) term lowers the
expected production of insulin proportional to the number of dead [1’—
cells in R. The more [f—cells die, the less insulin should be produced.
However, this relationship is not linear. Upon death of [f—cells, the
pancreas still attempts to generate the required insulin by signalling
the remaining live [f—cells to secrete higher levels (Pick et al., 1998).
This overburdening of cells is modelled with 0. The live cells will pro—
duce higher levels of insulin and compensate for the dead cells until a
threshold d is reached, after—which the cells cannot produce any
higher levels and the required level of insulin is not met. When this
happens, glucose levels in Equation (30) are not returned to normal,
and the pancreas is required to continue pumping insulin. More insu—
lin produces more amylin (Equation 35) at a ratio of 1:100 (Kahn et
al., 1990), and more amylin creates higher levels of amyloids
(Equation 34). Again, this relationship is not linear. When amylin
concentration is lower than a threshold 17, minimal amyloids form,
and when the threshold is exceeded, amyloid production is initiated
in high concentration. Equation (33) models the percentage of amyl—
oids in the pancreas system that form into oligomers of average length
[20. This percentage is positive or 0, depending on the efficacy of any
introduced oligomer inhibiting molecules. Because the death rate of
[f—cells due to oligomers resembles a very slow exponential—like curve
(Weir and Bonner—Weir, 2004), we use the compound interest for—
mula to model this phenomenon in Equation (32).

The key to suppress the deterioration of [f—cells is to minimize
the number of oligomers infecting cells, modelled in Equation (33).
Producing M molecules that bind well to the oligomers achieves this
result. In return, this affects Equation (32), lowering the number of
dead cells and stabilizing Equation (31) to produce the right quan—
tity of insulin. If the opposite occurs, Equation (33) produces more
oligomers, increasing the dead cells in Equation (32), and in turn
lowering the production of insulin in Equation (31). Glucose levels
will remain high in Equation (30), prompting more insulin to be pro—
duced, triggering an increase in amylin and amyloid production in
Equations (34) and (35). This in turn creates more oligomers, and
the cycle repeats.

Although the behavior of the subsystems of the theoretical model
presented in Equations (30)—(37) are known biologically, we do not
provide a simulation at different time points because there are way
too many parameters in the system of integral equations that we do
not have experimental values for. The aim of the model is to provide
the theoretical framework that incorporates amyloids, oligomers
and toxicity of the beta cells, and to show at a high level the general
effect of lowering oligomer concentration on the fitness of ll—cells. It
will become useful to extract data from simulating the model once
many of the parameters are discovered experimentally.

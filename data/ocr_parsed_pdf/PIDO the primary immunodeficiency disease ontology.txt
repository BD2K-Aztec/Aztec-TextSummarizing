ABSTRACT

Motivation: Primary immunodeficiency diseases (Ple) are
Mendelian conditions of high phenotypic complexity and low
incidence. They usually manifest in toddlers and infants, although
they can also occur much later in life. Information about Ple
is often widely scattered throughout the clinical as well as the
research literature and hard to find for both generalists as well
as experienced clinicians. Semantic Web technologies coupled to
clinical information systems can go some way toward addressing
this problem. Ontologies are a central component of such
a system, containing and centralizing knowledge about primary
immunodeficiencies in both a human- and computer-comprehensible
form. The development of an ontology of Ple is therefore a central
step toward developing informatics tools, which can support the
clinician in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.

Results: We present PIDO, the primary immunodeficiency disease
ontology. PIDO characterizes Ple in terms of the phenotypes
commonly observed by clinicians during a diagnosis process.
Phenotype terms in PIDO are formally defined using complex
definitions based on qualities, functions, processes and structures.
We provide mappings to biomedical reference ontologies to ensure
interoperability with ontologies in other domains. Based on PIDO, we
developed the PlDFinder, an ontology-driven software prototype that
can facilitate clinical decision support. PIDO connects immunological
knowledge across resources within a common framework and
thereby enables translational research and the development of
medical applications for the domain of immunology and primary
immunodeficiency diseases.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Immunological and clinical motivation

Primary immunodeﬁciency diseases (PIDs) are Mendelian diseases
of low incidence, caused by defects in genes involved in the
development, maintenance and regulation of the immune system.
PIDs most often affect toddlers and infants, but can also manifest
much later in life and into adulthood (Riminton and Limaye,
2004). As a disease group, PIDs are extremely heterogeneous and
according to the most recent classiﬁcation of the International Union
of Immunological Societies Primary Immunodeﬁciency Disease
Classiﬁcation Committee, >150 distinct forms of PID have been
identiﬁed (Geha et al., 2007), although >200 PID genes are known
at the time of writing (Keerthikumar et al., 2009).

These facts make primary immunodeﬁciencies a challenging
group of diseases for both the practicing clinician and the biomedical
researcher alike. The ﬁrst stumbling block is the comparatively low
incidence of these diseases: a recent study suggests that the average
prevalence of a PID in US households is ~1 in 1200 persons (Boyle
and Buckley, 2007), although other sources suggest incidences of up
to 1 in 2000 000. Many general practitioners as well as clinicians
have little or no familiarity with PIDs and consequently the time
that elapses from the ﬁrst manifestation of symptoms to a conﬁrmed
diagnosis is often long: a recent study investigating children with
Common Variable Immunodeﬁciency Disorders (CVID) found that
the mean time between the manifestation of symptoms and the
induction of immunoglobulin substitution therapy is 5.8 years
(Urschel et al., 2009). A second stumbling block is the fact that
the phenotypic variation associated with PIDs is usually very
high: in the case of patients with defects in the Wiskott—Aldrich
Syndrome Protein (WASP) gene, for example, the exact nature of
the gene defect (e. g. deletion versus missense or nonsense mutation,
precise location of splice-site abnormalities) will determine, whether
patients exhibit frilly developed Wiskott—Aldrich Syndrome (WAS)
(X-linked thrombocytopenia, B-cell lymphoma, frequent bacterial
and ﬁingal infections, eczema, small platelet sizes, etc.) or a milder
form (X-linked thrombocytopenia or neutropenia), which, in turn,
gives rise to a less-complex phenotype. A ﬁnal stumbling block
for clinicians is associated with information retrieval: there are
very few information resources containing structured and both
human and machine-comprehensible information related to PIDs
and their phenotypes. Examples of dedicated domain databases
include the ImmunoDeﬁciency Resource, (Valiaho et al., 2005),
Info4PI (Samarghitean and Vihinen, 2009) and the ESID Registry

(Guzman e1 (11., 2007). Valuable information concerning primary
immunodeﬁciencies is also contained in general bioinformatics
databases such as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database
(Hamosh e1 (11., 2005), which contains descriptions of phenotypes
associated with Mendelian diseases in free text form, ArrayExpress
(Parkinson e1 (11., 2009) or the Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett
e1 (11., 2009) for functional genomics data, UniProt (Consortium,
2010) (information about proteins), IntAct (Aranda e1 (11., 2010)
(protein/protein interactions) or KEGG (Kanehisa e1 (11., 2010)
(protein interactions and pathways). In practice, however, these
resources are difﬁcult to use for the average clinician and only
present fragmented information, rather than an integrated picture,
which is often needed by the clincal practitioner.

Biomedical researchers, wishing to engage in research in the
ﬁeld, are faced with similar problems. On the basis of literature
searches, it is currently extremely difﬁcult to even identify
which primary immunodeﬁciencies exist, what their phenotypes
are and to ﬁnd and integrate all the relevant information across
bioinformatics resources. For example, patients with suspected
PIDS of unclear origin are often given the diagnosis CVID
resulting in a large and diverse group of diseases bearing a
common label. As such, the problems faced by clinicians and
biomedical researchers signiﬁcantly overlap. Computational support
for both the clinician involved in the care of PID patients as
well as the biomedical researcher is therefore highly desirable and
necessary. Speciﬁcally, such support should lead to ‘knowledge
centralisation’ in two distinct ways. First, knowledge centralization
in the sense of data integration integrates PID-related data across
the various resources mentioned above and presents a uniﬁed
View to the end user. Knowledge centralization in the sense of
the development of both a human-comprehensible as well as a
machine-computable representation of information about PID can,
for example, lead to the development of expert systems that
utilize the represented information. Ontologies are both human-
comprehensible and machine computable speciﬁcations of the
knowledge in a domain of discourse and, as such, are well suited to
play a ‘centralising’ role. Here, we present the Ontology of Primary
Immunodeﬁciency Diseases (PIDO), describe how it interacts with
other relevant ontologies and demonstrate its application in a clinical
decision support system.

2 SYSTEMS AND METHODS

2.1 Ontological motivation

In order to bridge the genotypeiphenotype gap and to develop successful
computable representations of primary immunodeﬁciencies, a number of
domain as well as granularity boundaries must be traversed and integrated.
PIDs arise from complex interactions between gene products, pathways,
tissues, organs and the interaction with the environment. The description
and representation of these interactions should be computable and contain
an adequate theory of biological, chemical and immunological functions and
functionings. Consequently, an ontology of disease and phenotype should
provide the means to deﬁne phenotypes based on the processes, objects
and functions which give rise to a particular phenotype. For example, it
should be possible to infer from a phenotype such as agammaglobulinemia
that a patient does not have gamma-globulin as part and therefore that the
biological function of gamma-globulin cannot be realized in this patient.
To obtain these inferences and achieve interoperability with other relevant
ontologies such as anatomy, process, phenotype and disease ontologies, we

have adopted a method for formally deﬁning phenotypes (Hoehndorf at (11.,
2010b) for the development and axiomatization of PIDO.

In particular, our method of deﬁning phenotypes enables basic
interoperability with ontologies of anatomy and physiology, and we have
included links to the FMA and the GO for this purpose. PIDO does not
develop or use a classiﬁcation of PIDs such as the one proposed by the
International Union of Immunological Societies” Primary Immunodeﬁciency
Disease Classiﬁcation Committee (Geha at (11., 2007). However, combining
PIDO’s phenotype and disease deﬁnitions with anatomy ontologies can be
used for the generation of a novel PID classiﬁcation based on the axioms
in an anatomy or physiology ontology. For example, we can create a class
called ‘Agammaglobulinemias’ based on a combination of ‘HaVing Primary
Immunodeﬁciency Disease” and ‘HaVing Agammaglobulinemia’, and infer
which particular PIDs satisfy the deﬁnition of ‘Agammaglobulinemias’. The
generation of PID classiﬁcation based on complex class description enables
a ﬂexible and expressive access to PIDs and their associated phenotypes.

2.2 Biomarkers

PIDO characterizes PIDs based on both their phenotypes and associated
biomarkers. We deﬁne a biomarker as a role (Loebe, 2005) that a phenotype
plays within a clinical diagnosis process. The biomarker role is a role in an
observation process:

Phenotype and (plays_role some BiomarkerRole)
BiomarkerRole subclassof
(role_of some Clinical_Diagnosis_Process)

By specifying the type of clinical diagnosis process, the type of biomarker
may be further speciﬁed. An imaging biomarker, for example, is a biomarker
that is observed in a radiological observation process (e.g. projection
radiography or Computed Tomography Scanning). By analogy, a cellular
biomarker is a biomarker observed during a cytometric experiment. The PID
ontology provides an extensive hierarchy of biomarkers, which is useful for
the further classiﬁcation of phenotypes and any one phenotype will be able
to assume multiple biomarker roles. In the ﬁrst instance, the classiﬁcation
in terms of biomarkers will mirror the way in which most clinicians classify
phenotypes. The formal integration of biomarkers and diagnostic processes
in the PID ontology is the subject of future work.

Typical biomarkers are, for example, genomic biomarkers, cell functional
biomarkers, laboratory ﬁndings, etc. Collectively, the phenotypes playing
the role of biomarkers form the phenotype of a PID. All biomarkers were
manually extracted from the recent primary clinical and research literature
by domain experts. Incorporated biomarkers have been annotated with the
PubMed identiﬁer of the manuscript from which they were taken.

2.3 Relation to other ontologies

The ontology of PIDS draws on terms from many different domains such
as genetics, anatomy, chemistry and proteins. The PID ontology only uses
those terms which are necessary to achieve the desired expressiVity and
coverage and provides mappings to multiple established domain ontologies.
The mappings are constructed in such a way as to map class names and
deﬁnitions, but without importing axiomatizations.

The PID ontology’s classes have been mapped to key resources in
the biomedical domain to facilitate interoperability with other ontologies.
In particular, classes describing anatomical parts have been mapped to
the corresponding classes in the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA)
(Rosse and Mejino, 2003) and the NCI Thesaurus (Sioutos at (11., 2007).
Genes have been annotated with ofﬁcial gene symbols, alternative gene
symbols, gene names and corresponding associated Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM) (Hamosh at (11., 2005) phenotypes, all of which were
retrieved from Entrez Gene (Maglott at (11., 2007) as well as NCI Thesaurus
terms. Phenotypes have been annotated with corresponding terms from
the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (Robinson and Mundlos, 2010).
The manual annotation with corresponding phenotype terms derived from

the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (Smith and Eppig, 2010) is currently
ongoing, and annotations will be released in future versions of the ontology.

Furthermore, the mapping of terms referring to cellular components and
biological processes, to proteins, cell types and qualities is still in progress,
and mappings to the Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner at (11., 2000), the
Protein Ontology (PO) (Natale at (11., 2011), the Cell Type Ontology (CL)
(Bard at (11., 2005) and the Phenotypic Attribute and Trait Ontology (PATO)
(Gkoutos at (11., 2005) will be created (Table 1). The mappings are constructed
either manually or semi-automatically by using fuzzy string matches between
ontologies. Fuzzy matches are determined using the Levenshtein (Navarro,
2001) or Needleman7Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) algorithms
and validated by a human curator.

To demonstrate interoperability with other biomedical ontologies, in
particular phenotype and anatomy ontologies, we use automated reasoning
over phenotype and anatomy ontologies to derive representations of PID
phenotypes in the phenotype ontologies for other species. Such mappings
are of considerable use even for organisms, such as worms, for example,
which are very far apart from humans: simple model organisms that can
be used to develop comprehensive experimental analyses of the genetic
and molecular makeup of complex phenotypic traits have been the staple
of biomedical research for some time. For example, much work has been
done in the past to study the immune system of nematodes as a model
system for innate immunity (Schulenburg at (11., 2004). In particular, we
used the PhenomeBLAST software (http://phenomeblast.googlecode.com)
to generate mappings to the mouse, ﬂy and worm phenotype ontologies, and
we make these mappings available on our website.

PIDO uses the General Formal Ontology (GFO) (Herre at (11., 2006) as
an upper ontology, because the GFO facilitates the integration of objects
and processes, contains an expressive theory of relational and processual
roles (Loebe, 2005) and provides expressive axioms in its OWL version.
The taxonomic structure of the GFO is presented in Figure 1.

This strategy facilitates then reuse of existing resources and ontologies
while at the same time avoiding reasoning problems that arise due to the
large size of many reference ontologies. Furthermore, a single ontology that
combines the necessary fragments of relevant biomedical domain ontologies
is often easier to maintain and use (Bard and Rhee, 2004).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The PID ontology has been formalized in the Web Ontology
Language (OWL). The ontology has been edited using either
the Protege 4 (Knublauch et al., 2004) or TopBraid Composer
(http://www.topbraidcomposer.com) OWL editors as well as the
Manchester OWL API (Horridge and Bechhofer, 2009).

The PIDFinder Web Application was developed in the Java
programming language using the Google Web Toolkit (GWT,
http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) and Google App Engine (GAE,
http://code.google.com/appengine/) frameworks.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Canonical disease phenotypes

In the context of PIDO, we focus on the representation of the
canonical phenotype of PIDS: a canonical disease phenotype
consists of every observed phenotypic manifestation of the disease.
We emphasize, however, that patients do not commonly exhibit
all manifestations that are associated with a canonical disease
phenotype. As a consequence, we intend to explore the relation
between the observed phenotype in a patient and the canonical
phenotype of a disease using a measure of semantic similarity that is
able to account for incomplete and noisy information. Including all
possible observations associated with a disease in the description
of canonical disease phenotypes will enable us to increase the
similarity, if patients and disease phenotype overlap in any of these
phenotypes, and to decrease the similarity if they do not. We would
then count patient and disease as phenotypically most similar when
they fully overlap in their phenotypes. This method has already been
applied successfully for the identiﬁcation of novel gene—disease
association in the PhenomeNET system (Hoehndorf et al., 2011).

4.2 Use-case: WAS-related PIDs

WAS-related primary immunodeﬁciencies may arise as a
consequence of defects in the WAS gene. Several recent studies have
established good correlations between the type of gene defect and the
corresponding human phenotype (Imai et al., 2004; J in et al., 2004).
Patients with insertions into the WAS gene or complete deletions of
the gene have been found to develop full Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome,
whereas those with splice abnormalities develop either the ﬁill
form or a milder version, depending on the exact nature of the
splice abnormality. In PIDO, the following (clinical) phenotypes
are associated with Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome presence of anti-
DNA antibody, inﬂammation of the joints and colon, autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, B-cell and
hematopoietic cell neoplasms, bacterial, viral and ﬁingal infections,
bloody diarrhea, CD8+ T—cell dependent cytotoxicity defect,
eczema, immune-complex glomerulonephritis, myelodysplastic
syndrome, petechia and small platelet size.

We use the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome as an example to show
how this complex phenotype can be modeled in terms of more basic
phenotypes.

One commonly occurring phenotype in WAS patients is an
elevated level of anti-DNA antibodies present in the serum. We
formalize this as a phenotype of patients that have anti-DNA
antibodies as part which are present in an increased concentration:

Phenotype and phenotype_of some
(has_part some
(Anti—DNA_Antibody and (has_property
some Increased_Concentration) ) )

This enables the inference that entities with this phenotype have
Anti-DNA Antibodies as part and therefore enables interoperability
with anatomy ontologies that also use the has _part and par1_of
relations (Hoehndorf et al., 2010b). Based on this assertion, further
inferences across ontologies become possible. For example, anti-
DNA antibodies realize certain functions under a given set of
conditions. If the inference of presence or absence of a part is
subsequently combined with an ontology specifying, for example,

Fig. 1. Simpliﬁed schematic of the GFO and top-level classes of PIDO. The GFO is an ontology both of categories and individuals. Individuals are divided
into abstract individuals (such as numbers), concrete individuals (such as processes and material objects) and spatio-temporal individuals (regions of space or

time). Processes are subclasses of concrete individuals and phenotypes are considered to be relational roles. GFO classes are shown in gray.

the ﬁinction of the part, then inference over presence or absence of
ﬁinction—although not currently implemented in PIDO—also now
becomes a possibility (Hoehndorf et al., 2010a).

Another phenotype often associated with Wiskott—Aldrich
patients are frequently recurring bacterial, viral and ﬁingal
infections. Infections are processes in the GFO. Within GFO,
processes can be characterized by the modes in which entities
participate in a process, and these modes of participation are
considered to be the processual roles of a process (Herre et al.,
2006; Loebe, 2005). For the process of infection, at least two such
processual roles may be identiﬁed: the role of Infectious Agent and
the role of Infected Entity. Formally, we formulate the following
axioms:

Infection SubClassOf: gfo:Process and
(has_role some Infectious_Agent) and
(has_role some Infected_Entity)

Infectious_Agent SubClassOf:
gfo:Processual_role
and (role_of some gfo:Process)

Processual roles can be played by entities. Therefore, we can
deﬁne a Bacterial Infection as an infection in which the role of the
Infectious agent is played by a Bacterium:

Bacterial_Infection EquivalentTo:
(Infection and (has_role some
(Infectious_Agent and
(played_by some Bacterium) ) ))

Analogously, we are able to specify an infection by site rather than
by causative agent. For example, we can deﬁne a Gastrointestinal
Tract Infection:

Gastrointestinal_Trac t_Infection EquivalentTo:

(Infection and (has_role some
(Infected_Entity and played_by
some Gastrointestinal_Tract) ) )

This deﬁnition states that a Gastrointestinal Tract Infection is an
Infection in which the role of the Infected Entity is played by the

Gastrointestinal Tract. Based on these deﬁned classes, we can then
deﬁne Bacterial Gastrointestinal Tract Infection as follows:

Gas trointes tinal_Tract_Infection EquivalentTo:

(Infection and (has_role some
(Infected_Entity and played_by
some Gastrointestinal_Tract)) and
(has_role some (Infectious_Agent and
played_by some Bacterium) ))

After deﬁning the process Gastrointestinal Tract Infection, we are
able to deﬁne the phenotype Having Bacterial Infection:

Having_Bacterial_Ir1fection EquivalentTo:
phenotype_of some (plays—role some
(Infected_Entity and
role_of some Bacterial_Infection))

This deﬁnition states that the phenotype Having Bacterial
Infection is a phenotype of things that play the role of the Infected
entity within a Bacterial Infection process.

All process-based phenotype deﬁnitions in PIDO follow the
same pattern. As a ﬁiture extension to these phenotype deﬁnition
patterns, we could further deﬁne phenotypes such as ‘Having
Frequent Recurring Infections’ by explicitly referring to an
increase in the rate of occurrence of infections. However, while
deﬁnitions following such a pattern are used in other phenotype
ontologies and their inclusion will enable a basic form of
interoperability with these ontologies, a ﬁill deﬁnition of the
intended meaning of ‘frequently recurring’ is a substantial challenge
for ontology representation languages that may be addressed in the
future.

We can combine basic phenotypes to describe complex
phenomena such as syndromes by asserting the class representing
the complex phenomena as equivalent to or a subclass of all the
phenotypes that characterize it. For example, the Omenn Syndrome
is commonly associated with primary immunodeﬁciencies arising
due to defects of the RAGI or RAG2 genes (Santagata et al., 2000).
Patients presenting with the syndrome either have very large or
very small lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis and

alopecia. In PIDO, this can be formalized as:

Having_Omenn_Syndrome SubClassOf:
Having_Alopecia and
Having_Hepatosplenomegaly and
Having_Lymphocytosis and
(Having_Small_Lymthode or

Having_Large_Lymthode)

Canonical representations of primary immunodeﬁciency diseases
can be developed in an analogous manner by describing them as
intersections of simpler phenotypes.

4.3 Description Logic-based querying

The phenotype formalism developed here allows the use of queries
based on Description Logic. For example, when confronted with a
patient suspected of suffering from a primary immunodeﬁciency and
presenting with thrombocytopenia, a clinician might be interested
in PIDS that are associated with this phenotype. PIDO can facilitate
such queries. Currently, a reasoner will determine the subclasses of
the class

Having_Primary_Immunodeficiency_Di sease and
Having_Thrombocytopenia

to be Common Variable Immunodeﬁciency caused by CD81 Gene
Defect, Goods Syndrome, Hyper-IgM Syndrome Type 2, ORAII
Defect, RAGI/RAGZ SCID Phenotype with Expansion of Gamma-
Delta T-Cells, STIMI-Defect and WAS. If the patient subsequently
goes on to develop a B-cell lymphoma, the query can be expanded to

Having_Primary_Immunodeficiency_Di sease and
Having_Thrombocytopenia and
Having_B_Cel l_Lymphocytic_Neoplasm

In this case, the results narrow to the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
alone. Queries of this type can contribute to a diagnosis based
on the phenotypes observed in a patient. Using the same query,
a researcher might also determine, which genes are commonly
associated with Thrombocytopenia in PIDO. Because of the
particular axiomatization of phenotypes that includes possible gene
defects, the genetic causes underlying a PID can be retrieved using
querying in Description Logics, thereby leading to an integration
across levels of granularity.

4.4 The PID Finder

A prime motivation for PIDO’s development is to assist clinicians in
gaining a rapid overview over existing relevant PID knowledge as
well as to contribute to the diagnosis of PIDS. To demonstate PIDO’s
utility in clinical decision support, we developed the PIDFinder
(Fig. 2). The PIDFinder is a prototype web application, which
presents the information contained in the ontology in an easily
accessible manner and allows, apart from access to PIDO’s content,
the phenotypic comparison of PIDS and the generation of diagnosis
hypotheses. One central feature of PIDFinder is to allow a physician
to specify a set of phenotypes that are observed in a patient with a
suspected primary immunodeﬁciency disorder. The phenotypes are
displayed in a faceted manner using the biomarker classiﬁcation
as facets. The faceted classiﬁcation of phenotypes is automatically
inferred based on axioms in PIDO (Fig. 20).

Due to the axioms in PIDO, phenotypes can appear in several
facets: Hepatomegaly, for example, is inferred to be both an Imaging
Biomarker as it can be observed in an imaging process, as well
as a Liver Biomarker as it describes biological variation of the
liver. The interface also offers a simple text-based suggest-box
mechanism as an alternative search mode. Once phenotypes have
been selected, they are collected into a set and form the observed
phenotype of the patient. The patient phenotype set is subsequently
compared with the canonical set of phenotypes characterizing each
PID using the Tanimoto distance metric (Fig. 2d). The greater the
calculated Tanimoto coefﬁcient for an observed patient phenotype
set compared with a PID phenotype set, the greater the phenotypic
similarity between the observed phenotype of the patient and the
canonical disease phenotype. The result of the comparison is a
ranking of possible PIDS that are phenotypically similar to the
patient phenotype. The results of the comparison are subsequently
visualized and returned to the user either in a graph-based form
or a side-by-side comparison of overlapping and non-overlapping
phenotypes.

The Tanimoto distance is further used to compare phenotypic
similarity between PIDS themselves. The result is visualized in the
form of a heatmap (Fig. 2a) as well as for using a side-by-side
comparison of overlap and non-overlap between PID phenotypes
(Fig. 2b).

It should be noted that the PID Finder is only one of several use-
cases for PIDO and as such does not leverage all the possibilities
that the use of expressive and well-axiomatized ontologies offers.
For example, we have not implemented the ability to run DL queries
in the current version of the software and are also not currently using
formal reasoning to arrive at diagnosis suggestions, but have rather
opted for a semantic similarity approach using Tanimoto distances.
However, this does not mean that the development of a well-
axiomatized ontology is a wasted effort: the PIDFinder, for example,
makes use of reasoning to generate the multifaceted presentation of
phenotypes. The use of classiﬁers and formal descriptions also helps
to deal with ambiguity in the speciﬁcation of observed phenotypes:
if, for example, a clinician only selects the ‘Arthritis’ phenotype,
a classiﬁer will infer that there are more specialized subforrns
of arthritis (e.g. polyarthritis, oligoarthritis, etc.) in the ontology
and expand the selection made by the clinician in the PidFinder
user interface to include these phenotypes in the selection unless a
more deﬁned subtype is subsequently chosen. Finally, implementing
functionality allowing OWL DL Queries of the type discussed in the
previous section in the PID Finder also remains a possibility.

4.5 Limitations and future research

Future research related to PIDO will pursue several different
directions. First, the continued enrichment of the ontology with
content and cross-references to other ontologies and terminologies
will be of the highest priority. As such, we will continue to extract
and critically evaluate phenotypic information from the primary
research literature and incorporate it into the ontology. A second area
of ﬁiture extension is enriching the ontology with data from other
biomedical databases and ontologies. In particular, we intended to
fully incorporate the FMA and GO ontologies and utilize them for
the classiﬁcation of PIDS and their phenotypes. Third, we intend
to work with the developers and maintainers of PID registries

to both apply PIDO for the classiﬁcation and analysis of PID-
related information, and to extend PIDO with classes that are
relevant within the established PID resources. Finally, we intend
to further address the challenges involved in describing canonicity
and non-canonicity in biomedical ontologies (Hoehndorf et al.,
2007, 2010b).

The appropriate deﬁnition of phenotypes such as Having Small
Platelets Size (21 phenotype for Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome) or
Thrombocytopenia remains an open issue. The former refers to the
fact that the average of the platelet size distribution in a patient
is shifted to lower values with respect to that which is considered
normal, and thrombocytopenia denotes the situation in which the
number of platelets in the blood of a patient is reduced with respect
to the number that is considered normal.

4.6 Conclusions

We have developed PIDO, which characterizes PIDS by deﬁning
a semantically rich representation of the basic observable
characteristics in organisms. The characteristics are based on
descriptions of quality, function, structure or process and are
interoperable with other biomedical domain ontologies. Based
on PIDO, we have developed PIDFinder, a prototypical web-
based clinical decision support system that enables access to the

knowledge contained in the ontology and is capable of generating
diagnosis hypotheses. PIDO connects immunological knowledge
across resources within a common framework and thereby enables
translational research and the development of medical applications
for the domain of immunology and PIDS.

2.2 Gene annotation with keywords

As in GenCLiP (Huang et al., 2008), terms (including a single word, GO
terms and phrases followed with acronyms) that appeared frequently in
certain gene-related literatures were considered as keywords for these
genes. A fuzzy cluster algorithm (Huang da et al., 2009) was used to
group statistically overrepresented keywords to annotate input genes. A
user can add or remove keywords manually. To explore geneigene and
termiterm relationships graphically, a heat map can be created after
average linkage hierarchical clustering analysis.

2.3 Construction of gene network

For de novo extraction of molecular interaction, a rule-based approach
that considered words surrounding gene names and interaction words,
and distance between two genes or between interaction word and gene,
etc., was used to search sentences. Gene pairs from four manually curated
databases [HPRD, BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006), CORUM (Ruepp et al.,
2008) and IntAct] that were co-mentioned in sentences were additionally
considered as molecular interactions. The interactive gene network was
implemented through a customized Cytoscape Web (Lopes et al., 2010).
Meanwhile, a subnetwork can be constructed based on the free terms
speciﬁed by a user. When the free terms appear in the sentence (or an
abstract containing the sentence) of a gene pair, the connection will be
created. Simultaneously, random simulation was performed to determine
whether a gene network was speciﬁc for the input genes.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Gene name recognition

Our gene recognition procedure achieved an F—measure of 82.8%
(recall: 83.8%, precision: 81.8%) on BioCreative II (GN) test set,
which compared favorably with other tested methods (Morgan
et al., 2008). Moreover, we evaluated our procedure on the test
set of iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia, 2005). The F—measure was
0.86, which was better than iHOP. From whole Medline ab—
stracts, we identiﬁed 19 764 genes that occurred in ~3 540000
abstracts and 13 370000 sentences.

3.2 Recognition of keyword and molecular interaction

We identiﬁed 16448 keywords for 19 691 of 19 764 genes, where
3395 keywords were phrases with an acronym and 2053 were GO
terms. The de novo approach recognized 10545 genes forming
76437 pairs of molecular interactions, where 62 806 pairs were
not collected by the four PPI databases. In our manually defined
and other test sets, the precision of molecular interactions was
nearly 90%. Details and comparison with other tools is available
in Supplementary Data S1. After integrating the four databases,
molecular interactions increased to 94 058 pairs, which appeared
in ~2 440 000 sentences and 960 000 abstracts.

3.3 Application

GenCLiP 2.0 has three modules for text mining: ‘Gene Cluster
With Literature Proﬁles’, ‘Literature Mining Gene Networks’
and ‘Word Related Gene Search’. As an example, we took 65
upregulated and 53 downregulated genes (Sample 2 on the main
page) of keloid to compare with hypertrophic scar to illustrate
the application of our server. Unlike hypertrophic scars, keloids
are disﬁguring scars that extend beyond the original wound
borders and resist treatment.

In our analysis, enriched keywords were mostly related with cell
growth, extracellular matrix, epithelial mesenchymal transition
(EMT), cell migration, cell adhesion, mesenchymal stem cell and
wound healing. ‘Collagen’ was manually input as a search term,
and found that 10 upregulated genes (P = 7.366e—11) were closely
associated with collagen. These keywords are mostly concordant
with well—known characteristics of keloid. Interestingly, keratno—
cyte and keratinocyte differentiation were also annotated as key—
words, and associated genes were all downregulated genes except
for one (Supplementary Fig. S2A). This reminded us that we
should pay more attention to keratnocyte. Recent study has
also shown the important role of keloid keratinocytes in keloid
scarring, and it was also reported that there were a substantial
number of upregulated genes involved in EMT in keloid keratino—
cytes (Hahn et al., 2013). In the ‘Word Related Gene Search’
module, we obtained 28 of the 118 input genes that co—occurred
with ‘epithelial mesenchymal transition’ in sentences. We con—
ﬁrmed that 12 upregulated and 5 downregulated genes were
related to EMT. In our experience, in general, at least 50% of
the genes will be related to search terms. Resulting gene networks
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) showed that upregulated MMP2
played an important role in the network. Interestingly, THBS2,
CST3 and GLBl, as activators of MMP2, were upregulated,
whereas three inhibitors, ILlRN, S100A8 and S100A9, were
downregulated. Most of these genes had not been investigated
in keloid; however, keywords and the related gene search provided
strong evidence that they were closely associated with extracellular
matrix, EMT, cell migration and cell growth. Consequently, we
proposed that abnormal expression of these genes can cause
upregulation of MMP2 and may impact keloid progress.

4 CONCLUSIONS

GenCLiP 2.0 is a web—based tool that can analyze human genes
through three functions: (i) generation of enriched and clustered
keywords, which are generated based on occurrence frequencies
of free terms in gene—related literature or provided by a user, (ii)
construction of a gene—network using accurate molecular inter—
actions and generation of subnetworks based on user—deﬁned
query terms and (iii) querying of genes cooccurring with search
terms in a sentence or abstract. Our testing showed that
GenCLiP 2.0 is a practical tool for the analysis of high—through—
put experimental results. The databases will be updated every 6
months.

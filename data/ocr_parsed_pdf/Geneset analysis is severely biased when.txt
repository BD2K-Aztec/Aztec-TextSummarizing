one gene in a set with many highly differentially methylated CpG
sites or many genes in the same set with one highly differentially
methylated CpG site each. This distinction is important in stu—
dies of DNA methylation because there are many cases where
methylation of only one CpG site has been shown to perturb
expression (for example, Claus et al., 2012; Deng et al., 1999;
Sohn et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2006); hence, GREAT has not been
applied to data of this type. Here, we focus on the application of
GSA to the results of high—throughput DNA methylation experi—
ments. We show that GSA, as it is typically applied to DNA
methylation data, is severely biased and show that methods that
have previously been applied to RNA—seq data can be adapted to
correct this bias.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 Bias in GSA applied to the results of genome-wide
differential methylation studies

Microarray platforms designed to proﬁle DNA methylation
across the genome are typically designed such that some genes
are associated with a large number of probes, whereas others
have few associated probes. These differences stem from the
fact that different genes and gene promoters contain different
numbers of CpG sites. On the Agilent Human CpG Island
array, for example, the number of probes per gene promoter
ranges from 1 to 285 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Similar platforms
by NimbleGen (Human DNA Methylation 385 K Promoter Plus
CpG Island Array) and Illumina (Infinium HumanMethy—
lation450 BeadChip) contain from 1 to 80 and 1 to 1288
probes per gene, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
reason that these differences are problematic for GSA becomes
clear when we consider the methods currently used to identify
differentially methylated genes. For example, comparing tumor
and normal lung samples, Helman et a]. (2012) called a gene
differentially methylated when two nearby probes (allowing
one intervening probe) both showed at least a 2—fold difference
in methylation between the sample groups. Given this criterion,
genes (for example, SOCS4) that have only two associated
probes will be tested just once for differential methylation. By
contrast, PPP2R3B, which has 197 associated probes, is tested
nearly 400 times. It is clear that PPP2R3B is far more likely to
give false—positive results (resulting from probes exceeding these
f1xed thresholds by chance). Indeed, there is also more power to
detect a real differential methylation signal for genes with many
associated probes.

Many other ad hoc criteria have been applied to deﬁne differ—
entially methylated genes. For example, Dunwell et a]. (2010)
classed genes as differentially methylated if one associated
probe reached a fold change of >3. Other authors have used
more complex experimental designs and data analysis methodol—
ogies, but these do not eliminate the bias. For example, Kalari
et a]. (2012) used a peak calling method to identify regions that
appeared enriched for methylation; however, because of the dif—
ferent numbers of probes associated with each gene, it is clearly
more likely to call peaks on genes with many associated probes.
In all cases, where some genes are tested many more times than
others (as is typical in methylation analysis), genes with more
associated probes (in the case of microarrays) or more associated

CpG sites (in the case of high—throughput sequencing) are more
likely to fulﬁll whatever criteria is used, violating a key assump—
tion of GSA. The reason that this causes such a strong bias in
GSA is because there are also large differences between gene sets
in the mean numbers of associated probes per gene. For example,
on the Agilent Human CpG Island microarray, genes annotated
to the Gene Ontology term ‘Embryonic organ development’
(GO:0048568) have, on average, 22.7 associated probes, more
than twice the average of 9.8 probes for all genes.
Consequently, if the methodology used to identify differentially
methylated promoters is sensitive to the number of probes in the
promoter, this gene set is likely to contain a disproportionate
number of signiﬁcant genes, and thus is more likely to appear
to be significantly enriched in the subsequent GSA.

2.2 Reanalysis of a published dataset

Many published studies have applied GSA to high—throughput
methylation data (for example, Booth et al., 2012; Deng et al.,
2009; Doi et al., 2009; Elango et al., 2009; Irizarry et al., 2009;
Liu et al., 2010; Schroeder et al., 2011; Sen et al., 2010; Sproul
et al., 2012; Takeshima et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2012). In all of
these studies, regardless of the platform used, gene sets relating
to development, transcription or differentiation were reported to
be enriched for differentially methylated genes; however, these
gene sets are typically associated with large numbers of probes
per gene (the precise number depending on platform; Fig. 1a).
We now consider one such study in detail. Rauch et a]. (2008)
used the Agilent Human CpG Island microarray to assess methy—
lation in ﬁve lung cancer samples compared with normal lung
tissue and Helman et a]. (2012) applied GSA to identify hyper—
methylated gene sets in this dataset. CpG islands were called as
hypermethylated in a sample ‘when at least two adjacent probes,
allowing a one—probe gap, within the CpG island scored a fold—
difference factor of >2 when comparing tumor and normal tissue
DNA’ (Rauch et al., 2008). Genes were considered hypermethy—
lated in lung cancer if any associated CpG island met this criter—
ion in four out of the five samples. The R package GOStats was
then used to assess aberrant methylation of GO biological pro—
cesses (BP) containing between 100 and 1000 genes (Rauch et al.,
2008). We followed the original methodology and obtained
results similar to Helman et a1. (2012) (Table 1). The most
significantly enriched gene sets (including differentiation/
developmental and transcription factor activity related gene
sets) all consisted of genes that were associated with far more
microarray probes than average (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the en—
richment P—value for each gene set was strongly correlated with
the mean number of probes per gene (Fig. 1c). This suggests that
these results may be attributable, at least in part, to differences
between gene sets in the number of probes per gene.

2.3 Demonstration of bias using randomized probe
locations

As an additional line of evidence, we show that signiﬁcant results
can be achieved from this dataset using randomized data. To do
this, we carried out 100 random permutations of the probe log—
intensity values within each sample and repeated the inference of
differential methylation followed by GSA. To ensure that the
results were comparable with the original data, we modifled

2.7 Validation of bias-corrected GSA by comparison with
label permutation

Several authors have previously suggested correcting the results
of GSA using sample label permutations (Barry et al., 2005;
Efron and Tibshirani, 2007). For example, the popular tool
GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005) uses this approach. In many
cases (for example, the lung cancer study discussed earlier in the
text), this is not possible, and in many other cases, it may be
highly computationally intensive, there may be a limited number
of samples (meaning that it will be impossible to achieve statis—
tical signiﬁcance), or it may be difﬁcult because of the complexity
of the analysis pipelines sometimes applied to methylation data—
sets. However, in the case of our UC dataset, it is straightfor—
ward. Thus, we used this dataset to compare the results of the
GOSeq—corrected GSA method to the results obtained from
sample label permutations.

Applying an uncorrected GSA to the UC dataset identiﬁes
many highly signiﬁcant gene sets (Table 2). After correction
using sample label permutations, 19 gene sets were identiﬁed
with P< 0.05 (Table 4). GSA corrected by GOSeq identiﬁed 12
gene sets (Table 5; Supplementary Fig. S3) compared with 262
when using an uncorrected approach (suggesting that a large
proportion of the results from the original analysis were arti—
facts). Of the 12 gene sets identiﬁed using the corrected GSA,
11 were also identiﬁed by label permutation. The similarity to the

results of a robust permutation—based approach provides good
evidence that the corrected GSA performs well and is a suitable
method of accounting for bias in methylation data. By compari—
son, only 12 of the 19 gene sets identified using label permutation
were detected using the uncorrected GSA, despite an order of
magnitude more processes reported significant in the latter ana—
lysis. When a corrected analysis is applied, results in the UC
dataset are not signiﬁcant after correction for multiple testing.
Where label permutation is possible (e. g. in the UC experimental
design), it can be used to perform GSA in a way that is robust to
the differences in the number of probes per gene. However, it is
likely that GOSeq provides better power to detect gene sets that
are enriched for differentially methylated genes, as the statistical
signiﬁcance that can be achieved by a permutation method can
be limited because of the relatively small sample sizes that are
often encountered in genome—wide methylation experiments.

In the previous section, we showed that the results of an un—
corrected GSA applied to the lung cancer and UC datasets were
similar, a result that could potentially provide insight into UC—
associated carcinogenesis. However, when we corrected for the
number of probes per gene, the Pearson correlation between the
P—values in the UC and lung cancer datasets is dramatically
lower than for the uncorrected results (r: 0.17, compared with
r: 0.69), suggesting that the similar results were largely
artifactual.

3 CONCLUSIONS

In general, when different genes and gene sets are associated with
different a priori probabilities of appearing in the foreground list
as a consequence of factors other than those that are of biolo—
gical interest there is the potential for bias. This arises in many
GSA applications. It is common in GSA to associate multiple
and different numbers of features with each gene; typically, mul—
tiple features are collapsed onto single—gene identifiers. For in—
stance, the popular web—based GSA tool, DA VID (Huang et al.,
2009a, b) offers the option to use microarray probe IDs (e.g.
from methylation or gene expression arrays) as foreground and
background lists. These are converted to unique gene IDs before
statistical analysis. When there is a difference in the number of
probes associated with each gene, this can give rise to the bias
that we have outlined. In this article, we have demonstrated that
this causes severely biased results when GSA is applied to high—
throughput methylation data, typically leading to false—positive
results for gene sets related to development, differentiation and
transcription. This bias can be corrected by applying a GSA

method, such as GOSeq, that models the relationship between
the number of features (e.g. CpG probes in the case of micro—
arrays or CpG sites in the case of high—throughput sequencing)
associated with a gene and its probability of appearing in the
foreground list, or where applicable, by using sample label
permutations.

4 METHODS

4.1 Gene-set analysis using label permutation

Sample labels were rearranged in all possible combinations. As there were
a total of 10 samples, split equally between UC and control phenotypes,
this yielded 126 distinct arrangements of the samples. For each of these
arrangements, the enrichment odds ratio test statistic was re-calculated
for each gene set, using the same pipeline as the original analysis and
selecting the same number of hypermethylated genes (so that the GSA is
comparable between the observed and permuted data). P-values were
calculated as the proportion of the test statistics that were as extreme,
or more extreme, than the test statistic corresponding to the observed
data.

4.2 UC microarray data

MeDIP was performed to capture methylated DNA sequence as previ-
ously described by Weber et a]. with slight modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, 10 pg of
5-methylcytosine antibody was incubated with 50 pl of Dynabeads M-28
Sheep anti-mouse IgG for 5h in immunoprecipitate (IP) buffer at 4°C.
Genomic DNA was sonicated using the Branson digital soniﬁer, and 4 pg
of genomic DNA was incubated with the antibody-beads complex over-
night at 4°C. Then, the DNA-antibody-dynabeads complex was washed
three times with IP buffer and incubated with 5 pl of proteinase K for 2 h
at 55°C. In our experiment, we labeled the IP DNA with ﬂuorescent dye,
cyanine 3 and reference (R) DNA with cyanine 5 and co-hybridized to the
Agilent microarrays. The MeDIP followed by CpG island microarray
analysis enables us to identify the methylated and unmethylated CpG
islands between long-standing UC patients and age-matched control pa-
tients. Puriﬁcation of labeled products, array hybridization and scanning
were performed at the functional genomics and high-throughput screen-
ing facility at the National Centre for Biomedical Engineering Science,
NUI Galway.

Data were quantile normalized and analyzed using the Bioconductor
library limma. Genes with at least one associated hypermethylated probe
in UC (P<0.05) were selected for GSA. These data have been uploaded
to GEO and are available under accession number GSE39188.

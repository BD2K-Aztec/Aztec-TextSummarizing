Abstract

Summary: There is an increasing need for rich and dynamic biological data visualizations in
bioinformatic web applications. New standards in web technologies, like SVG 0r Canvas, are now
supported by most modern web browsers allowing the blossoming of powerful visualizations in
biological data analysis. The exploration of different ways to visualize genomic data is still chal—
lenging due to the lack of flexible tools to develop them. Here, I present a set of libraries aimed at
creating powerful tree— and track—based visualizations for the web. Its modularity and rich API facili—
tate the development of many different visualizations ranging from simple species trees to com—
plex visualizations comprising per—node data annotations or even simple genome browsers.
Availability and Implementation: The TnT libraries have been written in Javascript, licensed under
the APACHE 2.0 license and hosted at https://github.com/tntvis.

1 Introduction

The web has become the preferred platform to present biological
data to the scientific community. Several improvements in web tech-
nologies are enabling the blossoming of new web applications for
visualising this data: First, support of well established standards like
SVG and Canvas by all modern web browsers enables the creation
of rich interactive visual displays. Second, the vast improvement in
web browser performance has increased the complexity of visual-
izations. Third, the proliferation of RESTful services providing data
from reference biological resources permits easy access to biological
data directly from the browser. The direct availability of this data
also facilitates the development of reusable visualizations embed-
dable directly in web pages.

Reusability is another key component in modern web develop-
ment and a strong trend in current biological visualizations. BioJS
(Gémez et (11., 2013) aims to compile reusable widgets for biological
data visualization. It compiles over 120 components at the time of
writing (January 2016). However, writing reusable visualizations is
a complex task in which the developer has to take into account the
scope and the environment of the host application in which the visu-
alization will be embedded.

Representation of tree data structures has become very popular
in different biological fields like phylogenetics or ontology visual-
ization, while the representation of track-based annotations is cen-
tral to genome browsers (Kent et (11., 2002; Yates et (11., 2016),
sequence alignments (Larsson, 2014; Waterhouse et (11., 2009) or
general display of coordinate-based features such as protein se-
quence domain (Finn et (11., 2014).

Here, a new set of libraries aimed at creating configurable, dy-
namic and interactive re-usable visualizations of trees and track-
based annotations is presented. They are collectively called TnT,
standing for Trees and Tracks, and are distributed as independent
npm packages for easier integration in web applications. The devel-
opment of the TnT libraries have been driven by two main design
principles: flexibility and reusability. Flexibility is achieved by
exposing all its internals in a powerful and carefully designed API.
Reusability is maximized by developing the libraries as independent
units that can be combined.

TnT is being used by Ensembl (Yates et (11., 2016) to display
comparative genomics annotations and the Centre for Therapeutic
Target Validation (http://www.targetvalidation.org) to display both
genomic features and tree-based annotation in their websites.

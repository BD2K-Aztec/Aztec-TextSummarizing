Abstract

Motivation: The existing methods for genetic—interaction detection in genome—wide association
studies are designed from different paradigms, and their performances vary considerably for differ—
ent disease models. One important reason for this variability is that their construction is based on a
single—correlation model between SNPs and disease. Due to potential model preference and dis—
ease complexity, a single—objective method will therefore not work well in general, resulting in low
power and a high false—positive rate.

Method: In this work, we present a multi—objective heuristic optimization methodology named
MACOED for detecting genetic interactions. In MACOED, we combine both logistical regression
and Bayesian network methods, which are from opposing schools of statistics. The combination of
these two evaluation objectives proved to be complementary, resulting in higher power with a
lower false—positive rate than observed for optimizing either objective independently. To solve the
space and time complexity for high—dimension problems, a memory—based multi—objective ant
colony optimization algorithm is designed in MACOED that is able to retain non—dominated
solutions found in past iterations.

Results: We compared MACOED with other recent algorithms using both simulated and real data—
sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms others in both detection
power and computational feasibility for large datasets.

1 Introduction

 

With the development of genome—Wide high—density single nucleo—
tide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technology, genome—Wide
association studies (GWAS) that aim to explore associations
between SNPs and disease in a population play an increasingly
important role in identifying the causes of disease (Churchill et (11.,
2004; Fontanesi et (11., 2012). Although great success has been
achieved in identifying single—locus SNPs that are responsible for

disease such as Mendelian diseases (Moore et (11., 2010), searching
for susceptible loci for complex diseases, such as diabetes, hyperten—
sion and some psychiatric disorders, has proven to be more
problematic. One reason for this is that many diseases are inﬂuenced
by multi—locus SNPs that interact with each other in a process
known as epistasis and thereby complicating matters. Epistasis plays
an essential role in human complex disease, and methods designed

for single—locus detection do not work for epistasis detection due to
these interactions that cannot be modeled (Moore et (11., 2010).

Recently, a number of multi—locus approaches have been pro—
posed to detect epistasis. These approaches can generally be classi—
fied into three categories: (i) exhaustive search, (ii) stochastic search
and (iii) machine—learning approaches (Shang et (11., 2011; Xie et (11.,
2012).

Exhaustive search enumerates all possible single—locus and multi—
locus SNP combinations to identify the causative SNP or SNPs. A
representative method of exhaustive search is the multifactor—
dimensionality reduction algorithm, in which multi—locus genotypes
are partitioned into two groups termed high—risk and low—risk, thereby
reducing the original high—dimensional genotype—prediction problem
to one dimension. Next, an exhaustive search is then conducted with
these newly formed one—dimensional variables, and the model that
predicts disease status the best by cross—validation and permutation
testing will be selected (Ritchie et (11., 2001). Wan et al. (2010)
proposed another exhaustive search method named Boolean oper—
ation—based screening and testing (BOOST), which screens data using
an upper bound of the likelihood followed by an exhaustive search.
Although exhaustive search is the most straightforward idea that has
been helpful in many complex diseases, the recent high—dimensional
datasets (containing up to one million SNPs) that lead to the so—called
‘small sample size problem’ [e.g. the small N (number of samples),
large P (number of SNPs) problem] prohibit its practical application
in the real—world GWAS field because implementation requires tre—
mendous computing resources and takes an unusually long time.

Stochastic methods detect epistasis via random sampling that
can greatly speeds up the process. Bayesian epistasis association
mapping (BEAM) is one example. This method detects suspected
SNPs and their interactions via a Bayesian partitioning model and
computes the posterior probabilities of the candidates belonging to
true—associated SNPs and epistasis via Markov Chain Monte Carlo
sampling. BEAM significantly outperformed existing methods as
tested on an age—related macular degeneration GWAS dataset
(Zhang and Liu, 2007). However, stochastic methods are criticized
for using random elements in each iteration, which results in a dra—
matic loss of power as the search space expands exponentially
(Shang et (11., 201 1).

With the development of machine—learning technologies, an
increasing number of statistical learning methods have been used in
the GWAS field, such as regression—based algorithms (Wu et (11.,
2009), Bayesian networks (BNs) (Jiang et (11., 2011) and others. The
regression—based method is regarded as the most natural first—line
approach for modeling and testing genetic effects (Van Steen, 2012).
North et al. applied the logistic regression approach to case—control
association studies involving two causative loci (North et (11., 2005).
Jiang et al. (2011) tried a different solution which constructed a BN
to model the association between SNPs and disease that was subse—
quently evaluated by a series of scoring criteria. However, these
traditional statistical machine—learning methods still suffer from the
‘small sample size problem’ and generally perform poorly with real—
world GWAS datasets. To solve this problem, other machine—learn—
ing—based methods introduced heuristic information to speed up the
process, such as AntEpiSeeker (Wang et (11., 2010). Wang et al. de—
veloped the AntEpiSeeker method using heuristic search based on
the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm and performed better
than other methods on the rheumatoid arthritis dataset from the
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (Burton et (11., 2007).
Machine—learning—based methods are generally acknowledged to
have variable strengths and weakness due to their formation from
different aspects.

A number of studies have revealed that these approaches
perform inconsistently with different disease models and that even
the same approach will often vary when applied to different disease
models. One important reason is that existing approaches were
constructed based on a single correlation model or objective func—
tion for SNPs and disease. Considering the potential preference of
the correlation model and the complexity of different disease
models, a single—objective method will understandably not work
well in general. In this study, we proposed a new multi—objective
heuristic search approach based on the ACO algorithm called
MACOED.

We conducted experiments on a wide range of synthetic datasets
and achieved good power and time performance. We also compared
MACOED with the representative methods, including
AntEpiSeeker, BEAM and BOOST and found that our method
showed improved power in detecting correct epistatic interactions
with different disease models.

2 Materials

2.1 Simulated datasets

In this study, we present two different types of epistasis models com—
monly used in generating simulation datasets: the DME model
(which displays both the interactive and marginal effects of the dis—
ease) and the DNME model (which displays only interactive and no
marginal effects of the disease) (Shang et (11., 2011; Wan et (11.,
2010; Xie et (11., 2012).

An epistasis model is usually defined by the penetrance table
whose elements represent the probability of being affected with the
disease given the genotype combination, denoted as P(DlGi) where
D indicates disease and G,- indicates the ith genotype combination.
The penetrance values are usually decided by three parameters: dis—
ease prevalence (P(D)), genetic heritability (172) and minor allele fre—
quency (MAF). More details about the penetrance table and the
definitions of the three parameters are provided in the supplemen—
tary information.

Despite being given the three user—specified parameters above,
we still could not solve the penetrance table because too many
free parameters exist. Thus, in DME epistasis models, researchers
usually designate a penetrance function which represents the
relationship between each conditional probability P(DlGi). Using
this information, we can now numerically solve the penetrance table
and generate the datasets accordingly. In this article, we considered
three different penetrance functions used in DME epistasis models.
For these three penetrance functions, we fix P(D) and 172 and
vary MAF with four values (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5). Then,
through Equations (S8) and (S9), and the penetrance functions,
we obtain 12 different penetrance tables. Details about the three
DME models and corresponding 12 penetrance tables for different
parameter settings are provided in the supplementary information.
Here, we generated simulated datasets with solved DME pene—
trance tables using the software GAMETES_2.0 (Urbanowicz et (11.,
2012).

In DNME epistasis models with user—specified P(D), 172 and
MAP, we have no choice but to search the field of P(DlGi). If
P(D)G,~) satisfies the condition of displaying no marginal effects, a
DNME penetrance table will be obtained. Using the software
GAMETES_2.0, we can conveniently search the DNME penetrance
tables and generate the corresponding simulated datasets. In our ex—
periments, we searched 40 DNME penetrance tables with different
combinations of P(D), 172 and MAP and generated their simulated

datasets. The details about 40 DNME penetrance tables are also
provided in the supplementary information.

To study the effects of the algorithm, 100 datasets are generated
for each penetrance table, with each dataset containing 100 SNPs
and 1600 samples. Each dataset contains an equal number of cases
and controls for both the DME and DNME models. In addition, to
test the algorithm for different sizes, we generated another 100 data—
sets for each penetrance table, in which the SNP size varies from 20,
100, 500 and 1000 and the sample size varies from 200, 400, 800
and 1600. All these datasets can be downloaded at www.csbio.sjtu.
edu.cn/bioinf/MACOED/.

2.2 Real GWAS dataset

Late—onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is the most common form of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is frequently diagnosed in people
over 65 years of age. To date, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele
has been definitively determined to contribute to LOAD risk
(Avramopoulos, 2009). The APOE gene has three common variants,
82, 83 and 84, of which 82 has some protective effects by inhibiting
AD occurrence, while 84 has some induced effects by increasing inci—
dence of LOAD. SNPs related to LOAD have been reported in the
GWAS field (Reiman et (11., 2007). Reiman et al. found that 10 SNPs
located in the GAB2 gene on chromosome 1 1q14.1 have an epistasis
effect with APOE 84 in association with LOAD disease.

We applied the LOAD GWAS data from https://www.tgen.org/.
After pre—processing, the LOAD dataset consists of 1411 samples.
Of these, 861 were diagnosed with LOAD, and 550 were not. Each
sample in this dataset contains the genotype information of 312 316
SNPs, APOE status and LOAD status. Here, we recode the APOE
gene state with a binary variable where 1 represents the 84 variant
and 0 represents the other three variants. An SNP locus was recoded
as a quaternary variable considering the missing state.

3 Methods

In MACOED, two objectives are combined to evaluate the search
results. For the first one, standard logistic regression is used to
model the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, and the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score, which represents the like—
lihood and complexity of the model, is designated as Objective 1.
For the second one, we adopt a Bayesian perspective to model the
genotype—phenotype association using a BN and the BN—derived K2
score as Objective 2 to represent the fitness of the model and correl—
ation relationship between SNP subsets and disease status. The
above two objectives are designed from opposing schools of statis—
tics to rate the associations, and our following results show that they
are complementary to each other and result in a better performance
on general datasets.

For solving the small sample size problem, we consider the iden—
tification of the associated SNPs as a heuristic optimization prob—
lem. In MACOED, we obtained the optimal solutions (named the
non—dominated solutions) in terms of the two objectives using the
Pareto optimal optimization technique based on the ant colony sys—
tem (Chaharsooghi et (11., 2008).

To avoid the problem of randomness in the heuristic search, we
designed the following heuristic—exhaustive two—step protocol: (i) a
non—dominated SNP subset is generated by the multi—objective ACO
optimization algorithm; and (ii) an exhaustive search of epistatic
interactions is conducted with a  test within the derived non—
dominated SNP subset in the first stage. It is also worth pointing out
that the ACO optimization algorithm implemented in the first step

is different from the traditional ACO approach, as a new memory
strategy has been proposed to take into account correlations be—
tween successive iterations. Using the new ACO variant, the good
solutions found in each step will have a higher chance of being
retained.

3.1 Logistic regression and EN

Objective 1 is derived from logistic regression, which has been
widely used in GWAS (Wu et (11., 2009). Based on the results of
North et al. (2005), we construct the ADDINT logistic regression
model with the phenotypes as dependent variables and the geno—
types as independent variables. With logistic regression analysis, we
can compute the maximized log—likelihood of the model, denoted as
log lik, and the number of free parameters, denoted as d. Then we
obtain the AIC score of the model as follows:

AIC score : —210glik + 2d (1)

The AIC score reﬂects both the model’s fitness to the dataset by
log lik and the complexity by d. As the AIC score is designated as
Objective 1 in MACOED, by comparing AIC scores of different
SNPs in the model, the evidence for the effect of different SNPs on
disease risk can be investigated. In this modeling approach, SNPs
with low AIC score are considered as disease—correlated SNPs.

Objective 2 is derived from the BN, also known as the directed
graphical model. In the GWAS BN, the genotypes and phenotypes
are denoted as a set of nodes, and their conditional dependences are
denoted as a set of edges. There are many BN structure learning
methods, and on the basis of previous studies (Han et (11., 2012;
Jiang et (11., 201 1) in this article we choose the K2 score as follows:

I n+1 I 7:7
K2 scorejog : 2 log (b) — Z 2 log (d)>, (2)
[2:1

i:1 7:1 4:1

where I is the combinatorial number of SNP nodes with different
values (if l—SNP nodes are connected to disease node y, the number
of SNP nodes’ combinations is 3’ as the possible value of an SNP
node is 0, 1 or 2), ] is the state number of disease node y (two for all
samples), r,- is the number of cases with SNP nodes taking the ith
combination and r,-,- is the number of cases where the disease node
takes the jth state and its parents take the ith combination.

The K2 score is a measure of the causative relationship between
SNP nodes and disease nodes. Thus, we designate the K2 score as
Objective 2 in the proposed MACOED, and the lower the logarithm
score, the stronger the association between the SNP subset and the
disease (more details about the derivation of the two objectives are
in the supplementary information).

3.2 Pareto optimal approach

In the previous sections, we introduced two different modeling
approaches and their corresponding score functions. In MACOED,
we designate AIC score as Objective 1, K2 score as Objective 2 and
treat an SNP subset from whole GWAS data as a candidate
solution to the two objectives. For both objectives, the lower the
score, the stronger the association between the SNP subset and the
disease. Thus, the problem of detection of epistasis becomes the
problem of finding the best solution with respect to the two
objectives.

In the real world, a solution (an SNP subset) may have the best
performance in one Objective while performing poorly in the other
Objective as compared with other solutions. Thus, for a problem
with more than one Objective function, there is usually no unique

optimal solution. The relationship between two solutions has only
two possibilities: either one dominates the other or neither domin—
ates. In terms of the two objectives in this article, a solution A1 is
said to dominate another solution A2 if it satisfies both of the fol—
lowing conditions:

1. For both objectives, the value of fw(A1) is not higher than
fw(A2)‘

2. The Objective fw(A1) is strictly lower than fw(A2) for at least one
Objective.

where fw(°) is the Objective function as previously defined,
and w 6 {1,2} denotes the two Objective functions used in this
article.

If the above two conditions are satisfied, solution A1 is a non—
dominated solution, and, accordingly, A2 is a dominated solution.
For all solutions according to both objectives, we can classify them
into two sets: a non—dominated set and a dominated set. As all solu—
tions in the non—dominated set have equal optimizations, the epista—
sis detection problem can be extended to find a non—dominated set
of solutions, also known as the ‘Pareto Optimal Set’. The mathemat—
ical equation for the example 2—SNP epistasis model can be formu—
lated as follows:

19(14):) : AIC score(Ak)

7 (3)
f2(Ak) : K2 score10g(Ak)

Minimize{
where A is the decision space, and Ale 6 A.

Here, we use the non—dominated sort algorithm (Supplementary
Fig. S2) to find the non—dominated set in the decision space A (Deb,
1999). The pseudo code of the algorithm and the time complexity
are found in the supplementary information.

3.3 Ant colony optimization

To reduce the complexity of exhaustive search, we introduce a
swarm intelligence optimization algorithm named the ACO algo—
rithm, which has proved useful in GWAS.

In the case of GWAS, the detecting space comprises all SNPs and
their combinations. The ants traverse routes and construct solutions
which consist of any possible SNP combinations according to the
pheromone values and transfer rules. Pheromone values are stored
as a matrix 17, whose dimensionality is the number of SNPs in
the entire GWAS dataset, and whose element represents the
interaction between its column—label SNP and row—label SNP in
association with the disease. At the starting point of MACOED, the
pheromone value between every pair of SNPs is initialized to a
fixed value 170, meaning that we treat the interaction among each
SNP and the association between the SNPs and disease with equal
possibility.

The transfer rule indicates that an ant k selecting SNP /
from SNP i and consists of two parts, as described in Equations (4)
and (5):

I I i R  (4)
Pk(17/)— 1 When/ : randwkg» if(q > To),

where pk(i,/') is the probability that an ant selects SNP / followed by
SNP i, q is a number generated randomly with uniform distribution
in (0,1) and To is a threshold to balance the convergence speed and
to avoid being trapped into a locally optimal solution. Uk(i) is the
set of neighbor nodes of SNP node i that have not yet been visited by
ant k, and rand(Uk(i)) denotes the ant k selecting a random SNP
from the set Uk(i). R represents the selection strategy of the next

SNP to be added by considering their pheromones’ distribution. The
selection probability distribution of R is depicted as follows:

W571"i . . .
A” 1f(/ 5 UK!»
R : ZMEUk(I-)riu11u 7 

0 otherwise

where 17,-,- is pheromone value between SNP i and SNP /, 11,- is some
form of prior information on SNP /' and 5 and l)’ are parameters
determining the weights of pheromone value and prior information
on the SNPs, respectively. In our work, we let 11 equal to 1, indicat—
ing that we treat each locus equally before the optimization phase,
and, similarly, we let 5 equal to 1.

The ACO algorithm obtains the optimal solutions through posi—
tive feedback formed by the pheromone iteration. As described pre—
viously, all non—dominated solutions have the equivalent and highest
association strength with disease, and all other solutions must be
omitted. Thus, the pheromone value will be updated as:

1717*— (1-P)Ti;' + PAW/'7 (6)

where p is the evaporate coefficient between 0 and 1, and Ar,,- is the
changing pheromone value between SNP i and SNP / as calculated
below:

A, if A;a E non—dominated solution set
ATij : 7 (7)

0, otherwise

where A is a weight coefficient for non—dominated solutions.

In MACOED, we implement a variant of ACO in order to save
the optimal solutions in each iteration and speeding up the conver—
gence. In traditional ACO, each iteration is independent of each
other, so solutions generated in the previous iterations will be
ignored in the current iteration; such ‘zero—order’ working mode
will lose some of the good solutions already discovered in past iter—
ations. Instead of completely discarding the solutions from previous
iterations, we design a memory—based strategy to retain the non—
dominated solutions from the last iteration instead and compare
them to the detected solutions of new ants in the current iteration to
decide the final non—dominated solutions, which will continue to be
used in the next iteration. The merit of this strategy is that good so—
lutions generated in any of the iterations will not be lost, yielding a
more accurate way for epistasis searching. All non—dominated solu—
tions in the last iteration will be fed into the second stage of
MACOED after the number of ACO iterations reaches the user—
specified number.

3.4 Pearson’s 12 test

In the previous ‘screening’ stage, we have obtained a set of non—
dominated solutions after the ACO combined with the Pareto
optimal approach. In the next ‘cleaning’ stage, an exhaustive search
of epistatic interactions with Pearson’s x2 test is conducted within
the selected non—dominated solutions. The x2 test is the most fre—
quently used approach and has been integrated into many GWAS
software packages (Balding, 2006; Wang et (11., 2010; Zhang et (11.,
2012). The main virtue of the x2 test is its simple yet powerful com—
putation and its identification of associated SNPs without consider—
ing the disease model.

In epistasis detection, the x2 test is based on the contingency
table. The null hypothesis is that the SNP dataset has no association
with the disease, and the sampling distribution of the test statistic is
a x2 distribution when the null hypothesis is true. The alternative
hypothesis that the SNP dataset has a certain extant association

with the disease is accepted when the P—value of the test statistic is
below a user—defined significance level 010. However, facing the prob—
lem of increased type I error in the presence of multiple testing, we
implemented the conservative Bonferroni correction. Thus, SNP
subsets with P—value below the Bonferroni—corrected significance
level or: Clo/Ci" will be reported by the MACOED algorithm, where
m is the SNP number of the GWAS dataset and l is the user—specified
interaction size.

The elements discussed above are synthesized to comprise the
proposed MACOED algorithm; the pseudo code of our algorithm is
given in Supplementary Figure S3. Figure 1 shows an example
explaining of the MACOED algorithm for epistasis learning of
2—SNP interactions with a total SNP number of 5.

3.5 Evaluation criteria
To evaluate the performance of the epistasis—learning algorithm, the
power is traditionally defined as follows:

#

Power : m, (8)
where #(S) means the number of datasets in which the disease—
associated SNPs are successfully identified among all 100 datasets
generated by the same parameters and penetrance table.

Obviously, using only one criterion to evaluate a statistical
approach is one—sided. In the GWAS problem, we treat the true
associated SNP combinations as positives and the true unassociated
SNP combinations as negatives, leading to an imbalanced problem
of a small number of positives and a large number of negatives.
Taking the dataset used in our experiment as an example, the
dataset has 100 SNPs and thus has C100 :4950 different
combinations when considering 2—SNP correlations. In these com—
binations, we only have one true disease—associated SNP combin—
ation indicating one positive and all other 4949 combinations are
negatives. Using the traditional criteria, the more associated SNPs
an algorithm reports, the greater its chance of obtaining a high
power.

In order to strictly evaluate a method on its performance as bal—
anced by outputted true and false—positive rates, we introduce a set
of more appropriate criteria named precision, recall and F—measure,
which are calculated based on the confusion matrix (Fig. 2)
and commonly used in the pattern recognition field. The recall (also
known as sensitivity) is the number of true positives in the output
divided by the total number of true positives in all datasets
(Equation 9). The precision is the number of true positives in
the output divided by the total number of outputted values and is
used to reﬂect the false—positive rate of an algorithm (Equation 10).
In the GWAS problem, a high recall means the algorithm can
return most true associated SNP combinations without considering
the number of returned SNP combinations; while a high precision
means the true associated SNP combinations account for a high
proportion of the returned SNP combinations. The criterion
F—measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which is
a synthesized measure combining both precision and recall
(Equation 11).

4 Experiments and results

4.1 Experiments on simulated datasets
In this section, the MACOED algorithm was tested in terms of dif—
ferent aspects, and the section is organized as follows.

First, in order to demonstrate the superiority of combining mul—
tiple objectives over a single objective, a naive exhaustive multi—ob—
jective epistasis—detecting method is conducted to compare with
exhaustive single—objective method.

Second, the performance of the MACOED algorithm is com—
pared with some recently proposed methods, including
AntEpiSeeker, BEAM and BOOST. The software of the naive ex—
haustive multi—objective epistasis—detecting method and MACOED
can be downloaded from www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/MACOED/.

4.1.1 Multi-objective versus single-objective

In the exhaustive single—objective method, all SNP combinations are
evaluated by the score function, and the output ranks all SNP
combinations where the association with disease decreases as the
score increases. The output of the exhaustive multi—objective method
is a set of non—dominated solutions that are treated as having the

same optimum. To be unbiased, we set the number of outputted top
SNPs from a single—objective to be the same as the number of SNPs
in the non—dominated set of the multi—objective method.

Figure 3 presents the performance comparisons of different
methods on three DME models, and Figure 4 shows the results on
DNME models. Clearly, the results show that the multi—objective
method outperforms all single—objective methods in both the DME
and DNME models, demonstrating the multi—objective’s superiority
over the single—objective. In terms of the two single objective func—
tions, it shows that the performance of the K2 score and AIC score
are closer in DME models, indicating that the Bayesian model and
logistic model can fit the DME models well from different perspec—
tives. However, in DNME models the performance of the K2 score
is more robust than the AIC score. The reason for this discrepancy
may be that we consider all possible distributions of disease given
the associated SNPs to have equal likelihood in the Bayesian models,
while in the logistic models we only consider the ADDINT model
which might lose power because the disease model displays no mar—
ginal effects.

4.1.2 MACOED versus other comparative methods

We also compared our algorithm with some commonly used
algorithms, including AntEpiSeeker, BEAM and BOOST. In this
experiment, we set the significance threshold P—value as 0.1 after
Bonferroni correction; thus, the unadjusted P—value for 2—locus epis—
tasis detection in 100 SNPs is 0.1/C100 = 2.0202 X 1075.

We set the parameters of the three comparative methods accord—
ing to the author’s recommendations. In our method, we specified
several parameters including 10, T0, p, 2, dim_epi, num_ant and
max_iter (Supplementary Fig. S3). For a 2—locus epistasis detecting
experiment, we set 10 = 1 and dim_epi = 2. According to the previ—
ous study (Wang et 41]., 2010), a large To, p and 2 should be adopted
for a small number of SNPs in GWAS datasets (denoted as m) and
small values for a large m. The values of num_ant and max_iter are
also determined by m, where a large num_ant and max_iter should
be adopted correspondingly to a large m.

Because the key idea of our method is multi—objective based on
the ACO algorithm, we output the intermediate non—dominated so—
lutions in the screening stage and evaluate them with the same
power definition. Figure 5 presents the performance comparisons on
three DME models, and Supplementary Figure S4 presents the per—
formance comparisons on DNME models. As shown in Figure 5, the
results of the MACOED algorithm exhibit increased power on the
DME models when compared with other methods in most sets of
parameters, with the exception of MAP =0.05 on the first and se—
cond DME models. This is because tiny W and MAP values may
make the x2 test in the second stage of MACOED perform poorly,
where the contingency table might have some empty cells.

It is also interesting to observe from Figure 5 that the power of
intermediate results generated by the first stage of MACOED has a

better performance than the other methods in all settings of DME
models, denoting that the intermediate results are worth studying,
despite not returning correspondingly significant levels.
Supplementary Figure S4 shows the same trend with Figure 5 that
the MACOED has a better performance in high bl and MAFs.

These results demonstrate that, in DNME models, the perform—
ance of both the intermediate and final outputs of MACOED are
very comparable with the outputs of BOOST in the case of bl = 0.4,
0.2 and 0.1, while the power of MACOED is a bit lower than
BOOST on most models when bl = 0.05. This is because the DNME
models only display interactive with no marginal effects, while
BOOST’s mathematical model only considers the interactive with
no marginal effects, thus fitting this dataset perfectly. In addition,
BOOST adopts an approximated )(2 test with four degrees of free—
dom for 2—locus interactions, while MACOED takes a x2 test with
eight degrees of freedom. This may cause BOOST to report more
associated SNPs than other methods and achieve a higher power
accordingly.

To more strictly compare and evaluate different methods, we
adopt the aforementioned new criteria to reevaluate the outputs of
each method. Table 1 presents the precision, recall, and F—measure
of all three DME models with parameter settings of MAP = 0.2 for
all compared methods. The results of all parameter settings of the
DME models and DNME models can be seen in Supplementary
Tables S4 and S5.

As seen from Table 1, our MACOED method outperforms other
comparative methods not only in criterion recall but also in preci—
sion, thereby resulting in a superior performance in overall
F—measure. When MAF=0.2, MACOED has the highest recall in

the DME models 2 and 3, and the highest precision in all three
DME models, indicating that it has the lowest false—positive rate
(Type I error). Although the first stage of MACOED achieves the
highest recall in the DME model 1, it has low precision and low F—
measure, indicating that it improves the recall at the cost of increas—
ing the false—positive rate. However, the results of first stage of
MACOED in the other two DME models achieve relatively good
performances in all criteria and hence yield a closer F—measure with
MACOED.

In all 12 different parameter settings of the three DME models,
MACOED has the highest F—measure in nine of them, and the
increase from the second highest F—measure to the highest F—measure
ranges from 0.02 to 0.13 (Supplementary Table S4). BEAM has a
lower F—measure in most settings except for achieving the highest
when MAF : 0.05 of DME Model 2, possibly due to the data simu—
lation method and its stochastic protocol. BOOST achieves a high
recall especially in cases of high MAFs. However, its precision is
lower when compared with MACOED, which will thus yield a
lower F—measure. The results demonstrate that BOOST reports
more disease—associated SNPs, resulting in a high sensitivity but
with a higher false—positive rate. AntEpiSeeker has a good perform—
ance in both recall and precision, resulting in a high F—measure, due
to its minimizing false—positives procedure (Wang et (11., 2010).

In the 40 different parameter settings of DNME models,
MACOED achieves the highest F—measure in 36, and the remaining
four are achieved by BOOST (Supplementary Table S5). These
remaining four parameter settings are all in 172 : 0.01. These results
imply that MACOED may perform poorly with low heritability in
DNME models. In summary, most of the results prove that the
multi—objective method is an effective method for detection of
epistasis.

We also developed a comparative test between MACOED and
the random feature method. As the mean length of outputted SNPs
is 4 in MACOED, we randomly select four SNPs in each iteration in
the random feature method and this process iterates 50 times (the
same as the max_iter in MACOED). Then we combine the
selected SNPs in each iteration and obtain the mean evaluation
criteria for all models: Recall: 0.71, Precision:2 X 1074, and

F—measure : 4 X 1074. The comparative trial results indicate that the
random feature method tends to report too many false positives,
rendering the results meaningless.

In addition, in the comparison experiments among different
methods, we compare the mean running time and power for one
model (considering both the DME and DNME models) between
MACOED, AntEpiSeeker, BEAM and BOOST on different sample
sizes N and SNP sizes M. All experiments were performed on a com—
putation platform using a Windows system with 8G RAM and i7—
37700 CPU. The results are provided in Supplementary Figure S5 .
As can be seen, when M increases, the running—time curves of
MACOED, AntEpiSeeker and BEAM are between linear and quad—
ratic. Surprisingly, BOOST is the fastest method despite its categor—
ization as an exhaustive method. This is due to its efficient filtering
step that may also lose some good solutions. The power of
MACOED outperforms all three other methods on small SNP sizes
and is comparable with BOOST on large SNP sizes. On the other
hand, the running time of all methods increase linearly as N
increases. The power of MACOED outperforms the three other
methods in this case. These results demonstrate that MACOED is
time—efficient and capable of achieving better power than the
compared approaches.

4.2 Experiments on a real GWAS dataset

We performed 2—locus epistasis detection using our MACOED algo—
rithm in SNPs from each separated chromosome, combining APOE
gene state and parameters set as suggested in the previous section.
All outputted epistases of our MACOED algorithm contain the
APOE gene and the other SNPs scattered in all chromosomes, most
of which come from GAB2 with Bonferroni—corrected P—value : 0.1.
Seven of our detected SNPs, which come from chromosome 11, are
in the 10 SNPs reported by Reiman et al.

Interestingly, MACOED also identifies some new significant
genes that interact with the APOE gene. For example, the
rs6486084 and rs4347364 from chromosome 11 are reported by
MACOED but have not yet biologically validated. All the mined
new knowledge about epistatic interactions for LOAD is summar—
ized in Supplementary Table S6. The results suggest a basis for fur—
ther experimental validation and demonstrate that our method has
practicality for using in detecting gene—gene interactions on the real
GWAS datasets.

5 Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to implement a multi—
objective optimization framework based on swarm intelligence opti—
mization in the GWAS field. The success of MACOED is primarily
due to its complementary multi—objective and Pareto optimization,
which increases sensitivity and minimizes false positives. On the
other hand, our new memory—based strategy in the ACO algorithm
also helps to increase the final power.

Although the results demonstrate that our method performs well
on both simulated datasets and a real GWAS dataset, some limita—
tions remain. The performance of logistic regression, a parametric
method, partly depends on the mathematical model adopted in the
association study. Based on the study by North et al., different logis—
tic models used in the first stage of MACOED may partly affect the
results of non—dominated solutions (North et (11., 2005). Another
criticism of logistic regression is that the number of parameters in
models will increase exponentially when the number of loci

considered involved in epistasis increases, making the computation
impractical.

On the other hand, we take an equal likelihood for all possible dis—
tributions in Bayesian model, which may lose power in some
particular disease models. In addition, there is a number of criteria
used to evaluate the BN models’ fitness to the association study, e.g.
BDeu, MDL (Jiang et al., 2011). To balance the complexity and
accuracy of our algorithm, we adopted a naive evaluation score, which
may also partly affect the non—dominated solution results as well.

At the same time, the multi—objective algorithm may be criticized
for the complexity of multi—objective computation and the naive
non—dominated sorting used in Pareto optimal optimization. As the
dimension of the GWAS dataset increases, this problem becomes
more and more complex. Thus, in MACOED, we adopted the ACO
algorithm and employed the iteration method to solve the large—
dimension problem. Our previous experimental results demonstrate
that MACOED is time—efficient. However, a few different optimiza—
tion algorithms can be considered that would further reduce the
complexity in future works, such as the non—dominated sorting gen—
etic algorithm II (Deb et al., 2002). We are also prepared to use the
feature selection or filtering method to reduce the complexity of
MACOED when applied in large GWAS datasets.

In future studies, we intend to find more powerful modeling
approaches and corresponding score functions or appropriate effi—
cient optimization strategies that can be combined and ﬂexibly
embedded into our framework to increase its ability. The other im—
portant future direction is that we will try to determine the best way
to incorporate prior knowledge into MACOED when dealing with
specific GWAS datasets. Currently, we have not used prior informa—
tion in MACOED. However, useful prior information can improve
the power and efficiency of epistasis detection as indicated by
Greene et al. (2008).

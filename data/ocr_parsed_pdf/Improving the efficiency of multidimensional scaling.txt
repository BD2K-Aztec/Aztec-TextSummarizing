ABSTRACT

Motivation: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a well-known
multivariate statistical analysis method used for dimensionality
reduction and visualization of similarities and dissimilarities in
multidimensional data. The advantage of MDS with respect to
singular value decomposition (SVD) based methods such as principal
component analysis is its superior fidelity in representing the distance
between different instances specially for high-dimensional geometric
objects. Here, we investigate the importance of the choice of initial
conditions for MDS, and show that SVD is the best choice to
initiate MDS. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of the
first principal components of SVD to initiate the MDS algorithm is
more efficient than an iteration through all the principal components.
Adding stochasticity to the molecular dynamics simulations typically
used for MDS of large datasets, contrary to previous suggestions,
likewise does not increase accuracy. Finally, we introduce a k nearest
neighbor method to analyze the local structure of the geometric
objects and use it to control the quality of the dimensionality
reduction.

Results: We demonstrate here the, to our knowledge, most efficient
and accurate initialization strategy for MDS algorithms, reducing
considerably computational load. SVD-based initialization renders
MDS methodology much more useful in the analysis of high-
dimensional data such as functional genomics datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

The appropriate and faithful visualization of high-dimensional data
is often a prerequisite for their analysis as the human visual cortex
is still one of the most powerful tools to detect and conceptualize
structure in data (Holmes, 2006). Furthermore, communication of
numerical and statistical results is greatly aided by the intuition
arising from appropriate representations of data. Different methods

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

for the required dimensionality reduction have been developed
(Berthold and Hand, 2003).

An entire family of approaches, such as principal component
analysis (PCA) ﬁnds the minimal orthonormal basis using a
mathematical tool called singular value decomposition (SVD).
These methods, using different similarity or dissimilarity measures
such as covariance or correlation, order the ensemble of components
by their statistical deviation, and for visualization only the ﬁrst
two or three components are retained. Thereby, the statistical
information in the ﬁrst components are entirely retained, whereas
one of the subsequent components is entirely lost. Today’s high-
dimensional biological datasets can easily contain thousands of
instances (number of measures) with 105—109 variables (number
of parameters measured). The repartition of information is usually
homogeneous over the entire number of variables. In consequence,
considering only the ﬁrst components given by SVD-based
techniques is not necessarily the best choice.

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a methodology that reduces
dimensionality using only the information of similarities or
dissimilarities between instances, hereafter regrouped in the general
term of ‘distance’. The search for an optimal conﬁguration, is
reduced to ﬁnding the global minimum of a ﬁinction evaluating
the loss of distance information. To be sure to ﬁnd an acceptable
minima (i) an initial state for the optimization algorithm, and (ii) an
optimization algorithm and the appropriate parameters have to be
appropriately chosen. Recently, Andrecut (2009) has shown that the
best choice for the second is a molecular dynamics multidimensional
scaling approach.

We demonstrate here that the choice of the initial position is
paramount to the quality of the representation and its computational
efﬁciency. By using SVD for providing an initial conﬁguration for
MDS, we obtain a signiﬁcantly increased computational efﬁcacy.
Interestingly, we also demonstrate that performing an iterative
MDS or adding stochastic energy during the molecular dynamics,
MDS execution do not increase performance or reproducibility
of the algorithm. We also investigate the local structure of the
geometric objects after dimensionality reduction with our different
methodologies, and then evaluate the accuracy of the different
approaches developed here on biological data. These investigations
and the use of SVD to the initial state allow to better deﬁne and

control the dimensionality reduction process for high-dimensional
data.

2 METHODS
2.1 SVD

Given a data matrix X with n rows and [7 columns and xi]- its value in row i
and column j. we denote Xi the [7 components vector corresponding to row
i of the matrix, and  the n components vector corresponding to column j
of the matrix. A set of vector Xi is then a set of instances. whereas a set of
vector  is a set of variables. In all the following. we will use this notation
for vectors extracted from X.

It is known (Schmidt and Stewart. 1992) that every rectangular matrix
can be decomposed using its singular values:

X=USV’ (1)

where U (left singular vectors) and V (right singular vectors) are both square
orthogonal matrices. and S is a rectangular matrix containing the singular
values (s,) which are positive (S ,7 = X,» and S i]- = O). U .S and V are reorganized
in order to have s1 > s; > --- > s,, with r being the rank of S. Generally. before
performing SVD X is centered. so the mean of each column is equal to zero.
In this context. rank(X) =rank(S) 5 min(n— 1,17) ifX is n.p.

Singular value decomposition provides three major types of
information:

(i) A new data matrix Xnew. which represent the data points in a new
orthonormal basis with a minimum number of components. and where
distance between the instances is preserved.

(ii) Inertia parameters Ci =si/ Zisi (with 21.0,»: 1) indicate the SD
and relative contribution of the cloud of points on each principal
component.

(iii) The matrix V carrying the individual contributions to each principal
component. These different types of information have already
previously been used in the literature to infer biological knowledge
in various settings [Alter et al. (2000. 2003); Fellenberg et al. (2001);
Wall et al. (2003)]. The simplest way to ﬁnd SVD. is to search ﬁrst for
the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the inner and outer products.
As ﬁnding the eigenvalues of a matrix X with n rows and [7 columns. is
hard to perform for objects with a high number of variables. this step is
only feasible if either n or p are small (typically inferior to 1000. which
is usually the case in biological datasets). If both n and p are large.
one is obliged to use iterative SVD techniques as shown in Schmidt
and Stewart (1992). One advantage of using SVD is its close link to
classical techniques of dimensionality reduction such as PCA. classical
scaling (cMDS). principal component correlation analysis (PCCA) and
correspondence analysis. The different results of these techniques can
be obtained using SVD and a proper normalization of the data. as
shown below. SVD allows to demonstrate that the inner-product (XX ’ )
and outer-product (X ’X ) of a data matrix X have the same eigenvalues
M. with Aizsiz. IfX=USV’ then:

XX’=USV’(VS’U’)=USS’U’ (2)
X’X=(VS’U’)USV’=VS’SV’ (3)
Note also that missing values in data can be imputed using SVD [Brock
et al. (2008); Candes and Recht (2008); Troyanskaya et al. (2001)]. If the
number of missing values is relatively low. the Eckart Young theorem (Eckart
and Young, 1936). which is the most commonly used theorem for matrix
approximation. assures that the result of the SVD will change only in the
value of the last singular values. Hence. for a rapid imputation. the row
average method (Troyanskaya et al.. 2001) can be used which is generally
sufﬁciently precise in most cases. Also. PCA is a very good choice for
the initial state for K—means clustering (Ding and He. 2004). In the new
representation given by SVD. cluster structure of the data will then naturally
appear, and thus provide a natural interpretation of clusters.

2.2 SVD and classical techniques of dimensionality
reduction

PCA relies on the search of the eigenvectors’ covariance matrix. Hence.
performing PCA reduces to ﬁnding the outer-product’s eigenvectors. The
singular values of X are the square root of the outer-product’s eigenvalues.
The link between PCA and SVD then becomes obvious (Wall et al..
2003). Classical scaling (cMDS for classical Multidimensional Scaling) was
invented to embed a set of instances in the simplest space possible. with
the constraint of preserving the Euclidean distance between data points.
Euclidean distance can be written as a sum of inner-products X,».Xj. one
can pass from an Euclidean distance matrix to an inner product matrix by
a simple matrix manipulation called double centering (Torgerson. 1952).
Consequently. classical scaling consists in ﬁnding eigenvalue factorization
of the inner-product matrix, so it can be performed using SVD. The link
given by SVD between inner and outer product matrices implies that PCA
and classical scaling give the same results, a fact reﬂected by classical
scaling sometimes being referred to principal coordinate analysis. Principal
component correlation analysis (PCCA) uses correlation between variables
to ﬁnd a minimal orthonormal basis. After a proper normalization of
the data with their SD: X =( X”
0(Xf)
factorization of the outer-product matrix. Hence. after normalization of the
data PCCA results are given by SVD. Correspondence analysis is used in the
dimensionality reduction of contingency tables obtained after an operation
of counting on categorical data (Berthold and Hand. 2003). This method
can be used for microarray data analyses (Fellenberg et al.. 2001) as each
value of gene expression is. in fact. a count of the number of RNAs produced.
Generally speaking, this technique is used to compare two vectors in terms of
their distribution proﬁles using the chi-square distance. When the distance
is equal to zero, both vectors have the same statistical distribution. It can

be shown (Cuadras and Fortiana. 1995) that X2 distance can be reduced to
xm/W
(v ZIXIkXZIXiI)

Thus. to ﬁnd the minimal space which embeds the data and conserves the
information of X2 distance one performs a cMDS or PCA on the rescaled

 

). PCCA is performed by eigenvalue

an Euclidean distance after normalization of the data Xik =

data matrix using SVD results.

2.3 MDS

MDS is a class of techniques to represent instances in an r dimensional
space given an initial state and a similarity or dissimilarity matrix (Cox and
Cox, 2000; Kruskal and Wish. 1978). Recently, molecular dynamics (MD)
approaches have been used to perform MDS for high-dimensional objects
drastically increasing quality of the dimensionality reduction (Andrecut.
2009). We have also developed a similar approach based on a spring analogy.
Data points are connected to all other instances with Virtual springs. The
springs will tend to return to their equilibrium length during molecular
dynamics simulation. The equilibrium length for the spring between point i
and point j will be deﬁned as the Euclidean distance d(X,»,X]-) in the initial
state. For each instance X i . a force is deﬁned F (X i). which is the sum of all
spring interactions F,1,,(X,»,Xj) with the other instances  minus a friction
term to avoid oscillation of the spring network:

F.,,,(x,».x,->=—kU(6(xi.&>—d(xi.&>>®4?.) (4)
F0?»=2errxi®>wmixi (5)
#i

with 6(Xi,X]-) being the distance between instances in the r dimensional
space. ky- the strength of spring  y the friction parameter and mi the mass
given to each point. We consider that every spring and all instances are equal
in strength and weight so kg- and mi are the same for every 1' and j (ky- =k and
mi =m). It is. however. possible to use different pararnetersifor instance.
according to experimental precisioniif different weights shall be considered
for the different instances. A molecular simulation using the force vector is
then executed. Following Newton’s law it follows: miXi =F (X i). with Xi the
double temporal derivation of vector X,»(t). In order to ﬁnd the new position

parameters of the simulation k. m, y At have to be well chosen. Here we
used: k=1. m=5. y=O.1 At=0.02 (cf. Fig. 2A). For the initial state. the
data provided to the MDS algorithm were rescaled to ﬁt in a hypercube
with a diameter of 6 by multiplying the initial state matrix by a scalar oz. To
control the minimization process at each time step. a cost function termed
the Kruskal stress is calculated according to Cox and Cox (2000):

this global parameter is a direct evaluation of the amount of energy in the
system and hence the loss of distance information.

2.4 Datasets used in this study

To test and illustrate the algorithm discussed here, we have used several
publicly available datasets of different origin. We have used two different
transcriptome datasets. Brieﬂy. the cellular transcriptome is deﬁned as the
ensemble of RNA molecules resulting from gene expression in a cell.
Using microarray technology. in the human case. some 30000 different
RNA species can be quantiﬁed simultaneously. The dataset here referred
to ‘d1796Cell” includes 96 transcriptome measurements generated from 32
individual human tissues under non-pathological conditions. This dataset
was initially published by Dezso et al. (2008). and is available for
download from: http://mace.ihes.fr using accession number: 2914508814.
The dataset here called ‘d67CCYier” [(Iyer et al.. 1999); mace access.
no.: 2960354318] is composed of 12 human ﬁbroblast transcriptome data
points generated over 24h during the cell cycle. Note that we eliminated
1 (Interleukin 8. IL8) of the 517 genes as an outlier from this dataset.
The dataset ‘d2796Cell_T” (cf. Table 1) is a derivative of the initial
dataset d1796Cell”. where only genes were retained that are speciﬁc
to one and only one human tissue as provided in (Dezso et al.. 2008).
and removing again one outlier gene (Probe_ID: 162105). The dataset
‘d8796Cell_T” (cf. Table 1) is the transposed (Instances. Variables) dataset
‘d2796Cell_T”. All transcriptome datasets were median normalized in log2-
space and processed according to standard procedures (Benecke. 2008; Noth
et al.. 2006). Seven additional datasets with no relation to biology were
used. Both originate from the Machine Learning Repository (Frank and

Asuncion. 2010): http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml (i) ‘Iris” here ‘d3ilris”. (ii)
‘Wine” here ‘dPWineﬂ (iii) ‘Pima Indians Diabetes” here ‘d7iPima”.
(iv) ‘SECOM” here ‘d9iSecom”, (V) ‘Ozone Level Detection” here
‘d107Ozone”. (Vi) ‘E. Coli Genes” here ‘d12iEcoli” and (Vii) ‘Waveform
Database Generator (Version 1)” here: ‘d137Wave”. Please refer to the
ML repository for details on these data. Finally. we generated two random
datasets: (i) one with 200 instances and 50 variables between —6 and 6 here
‘d5iStochast 200”. (ii) the other with 3000 instances and 300 variables
between —6 and 6 here ‘dl liStochast 3000”. The number of instances and
the number of variables for all 13 datasets is given in Table 1.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Comparison of different initialization methods for
MDS

We postulated that the inconveniences associated with the combined
molecular dynamics MDS techniques (hereafter simply: MDS)
related to the dependence on the choice of the initial condition for
the simulation leading to insufﬁcient control and being trapped in
local minima on the one hand, as well as the large information loss
when SVD techniques are used for dimensionality reduction on the
other hand, can be overcome when both methods are combined.
We therefore created an SVD—MDS algorithm which uses SVD
to compute the initial state of a molecular dynamics simulated
MDS. This SVD—MDS approach was then compared to SVD and
MDS on 13 different datasets (Table 1). Figure 1 well illustrates
the shortcomings of SVD and MDS alone and how SVD—MDS
overcomes those. The dataset ‘d1—96Cell” containing 96 different
instances was used to compute a 2D representation using SVD
(Fig. 1A), our combined SVD—MDS approach (Fig. 1B) and two
examples of MDS initialized by random positions deﬁning a 12
unit hypercube (Fig. 1C and D). According to the Kruskal stress e,
MDS techniques (Fig. lB—D) better preserve the distances between
the instances and their relationship. The data cloud is better resolved
(see also blow ups) and the global distance information loss is lower
than for SVD.

In order to demonstrate generality of our approach, we next
analyzed the 12 remaining datasets (Table 1) using four different
approaches: (i) SVD only, (ii) SVD—MDS, (iii) MDS initialized with
all data points placed at zero with minimal random noise (zeroMDS),
and (iv) MDS initialized with random positions (stochastMDS).
The results are reported in Table 2. In all cases, we reduced the
dimensions to two. It becomes again apparent from the Kruskal
stress that the MDS-based techniques systematically outperform the
SVD. While stochastMDS, zeroMDS and SVD—MDS give similar
results in terms of the ﬁnal information loss, the number of time-
steps needed to identify a minimum stress is greatly reduced using
SVD—MDS (Table 2 and for four examples Fig. 2). Therefore,
SVD—MDS approaches the ﬁnal state (here deﬁned as a Kruskal
stress value) faster than either of the MDS methods. We show
an example of stress evolution in Figure 3A where stochastMDS
and zeroMDS are slow due to the existence of local minima, and
SVD—MDS clearly outperform them.

3.2 Iterative dimensionality reduction using
iSVD—MDS
We next wondered whether the dimensionality reduction could be

further improved by a step-wise reduction of one dimension after
another. To this end, we compared again the performance of the three

Fig. 1. Comparison of the results of different dimensionality reduction techniques on the same dataset. The dataset ‘d1796Cell”. composed of 96 individual
transcriptome proﬁles generated from 32 different human tissues (cf. Table 1 and Section 2.4) was represented in 2D space using: (a) SVD based on covariance.
(b) SVD-initialized multidimensional scaling; (c) random initialized multidimensional scaling. and (d) as in (c) using the same algorithm and leading to a
different random position matrix. The peripheral data points were color coded and labeled according to the human tissue analyzed. For (a) and (b) the central
cloud of points has been zoomed into at the same scaling factor. The resulting Kruskal Stress e for each of the dimensionality reductions is indicated. Similar

computations were used to generate Table 2.

techniques SVD—MDS, MDS and iterative SVD—MDS (iSVD—
MDS) on the different datasets. In iSVD—MDS, for each successive
round a SVD followed by a subsequent molecular dynamics
MDS is performed. As can be seen in Figure 3A, SVD—MDS
rapidly approaches a minimal Kruskal stress conﬁguration over the
simulation time. The previously described MDS procedure which
uses stochastic initiation for the molecular dynamics simulation
requires much more simulation time to ﬁnd the same minimal
stress conﬁguration as the SVD—MDS algorithm. Finally, the
iterative iSVD—MDS approach will also converge to the identical
minimum obtained by the other methods; however, as for each
component a separate simulation is performed the convergence
time is greatly increased. Albeit many different simulations on the
different datasets, we have never obtained a ﬁnal conﬁguration using
iSVD—MDS where the Kruskal stress would allow to conclude
on an improved performance when compared to SVD—MDS.
Therefore, the iterative method does not allow for improved
accuracy, but rather prolongs simulation time with no immediate
gain (Table 3 summarizes the results). We next compared iSVD
and iSVD—MDS methods to determine how the loss of information
is distributed during iterative dimensionality reduction. As can be

seen in Figure 3B for both procedures, the amount of stress or
lost information increases both relatively and absolutely with the
number of components removed. Note also, that the iSVD—MDS
method better preserves at every consecutive iteration the distance
information of the object (Fig. 3B).

3.3 Molecular dynamics dimensionality reduction with
added stochasticity

In Andrecut (2009), an approach reminiscent of simulated annealing
was used to avoid getting trapped in local minima during the
molecular dynamics simulation. This combination of methods
is equivalent to adding a stochastic force to all data points
FstochastiC(Xi)=—T*s(t) where s(t) is a random number given
by a generalized Gaussian stochastic distribution, and T is
the temperature of the system. By decreasing T exponentially
during the simulation, one expects to reach the global minimum.
Adding stochasticity to the molecular dynamics-driven MDS is,
after Andrecut (2009), required to insure reproducibility of the
algorithmic performance.

algorithms do not improve MDS, on the contrary they converge
slower.

We next asked whether or not similarly adding stochasticity to the
SVD—MDS algorithm would improve its performance. Figure 3C
and D illustrates that indeed adding different amounts of energy
at different times of the simulation (arrows) does not lead to
lower energy minima. The SVD—MDS algorithm, similarly as the
MD—MDS algorithms (Table 3), always converges to the same
energy state. This has also been conﬁrmed using other datasets (data
not shown). Taken together, the results using MD—MDS-lin and
MD—MDS-exp and SVD—MDS strongly suggest that only a single
ground state is present. While we do not have any formal proof,
we believe that the detailed analysis of the geometric structure of
the data objects presented below also strongly argues in favor of a
global energy minimum.

3.4 Geometric structure

Kruskal stress directly evaluates the distance information
deformation. Graef et al. demonstrated in 1979 (Graef and Spence,
1979), that it rather evaluates global deformation of the cloud
of instances. To gain information on local distances deformation,
we deﬁne a new parameter, Entourage. For any one instance Xi
in the reference distribution obtained through SVD (undistorted
representation), we consider its k nearest neighbors: Nimf. In the
new distribution obtained after dimensionality reduction, we also
compute the k nearest neighbors for the same instance Xi, and obtain
a list: Ninew. We then search for Gi=card(Nl.refﬂNineW), which
will be the number of instances common to both. This operation is
repeated for all instances i, and one obtains the Entourage parameter:

2L1 Gi
G

with G=nk a normalization parameter (Ent e (0, 1)).
If 01- = cardoviref ﬂNineW) e0.01c:1rd(1viref ) =0.01k for every i

then EnthW=00L a difference of 1% between two

values of Entourage corresponds to an average deformation of 1%
in the local organization. This parameter has more signiﬁcation for

Emk = (9)

a small number of neighbors k compared to the total number of
points n.

The geometric properties of the data objects are analyzed using the
Entourage parameter. We have plotted the relationship of Entourage
and k for six different methodologies: zeroMDS, stochastMDS,
SVD—MDS, iSVDMDS, MD—MDS-lin, MD—MDS-exp in Figure 4
for eight different datasets. From the selected examples, it becomes
clear that again the SVD—MDS method outperforms the different
types of MDS over a wide array of structures analyzed as the
Entourage value is consistently higher no matter how many different
k nearest neighbors are considered. The iterative iSVD—MDS
method, due to the accumulation of small residual errors during the
molecular dynamics simulation, and the MDS method give similar
results. At the cost of increasing computational load, the iSVD—
MDS better and better approximates the SVD—MDS method. In
conclusion, the SVD—MDS method, under all conditions tested,
better represents the geometric structure of the datasets in low-
dimensional space when compared to the input object with rank(S)
components (given by SVD). Note that this holds even for objects
with equal stress.

Figure 1 illustrates the problem of rotational variance when
using stochastically initiated molecular dynamics simulations for
MDS. When comparing Figure 1C and D as well as comparing
them to Figure 1A and B that stochastMDS results produces
near-optimal solutions (with respect to the Kruskal stress), the
resulting orientation of the instances, however, is different (focus,
for instance, on the relationship between ‘skeletal muscle” and ‘fetal
liver”). SVD—MDS on the contrary only produces a single result.
This observation, taken together with the results on the relevance
of stochasticity in the simulation obtained above, argues for the
existence of different equivalent energy minima that only differ in
the rotational orientation of the object and (at best) only minimally in
the Kruskal-stress; a fact predicted by mathematical consideration.
Hence, SVD—MDS not only reduces signiﬁcantly the computational
load, but also insures uniqueness of the resulting representation. The
quality of this ﬁnal and unique representation can be demonstrated
using the Entourage parameter. The increase in ﬁdelity in the
representation of data should not be underestimated (see also Fig. 5).

This is reminiscent to techniques of principal manifold searches
(Gorban et al., 2008) where parameters describing topology, local
organization or other geometric characteristics are used.

A major advantage of using SVD to deﬁne the initial state is that
it provides the inertia of each principal component. The comparison
of the different internal structures of the studied datasets showed a
vast variety of proﬁles. A good dimensionality reduction technique
would ideally account for these differences. Taking into account the
inertia, the stress and the Entourage during the MDS process will
help to have an even more accurate representation of the data matrix
in low-dimensional space.

3.5 Data analysis

In order to demonstrate the applicability of the SVD—MDS
methodology and its superior performance, we reanalyzed a
previously published biological dataset not yet used here (Prakash
et al., 2006). The datasets consists of quantitative measures for
10 selected cytokines in a cohort of human malaria patients from
central India displaying different severeness of disease as well as
endemic and non-endemic control subjects. A total of 98 patients
were included in the original study by Prakash et al. (2006). The
main objective is to determine whether individual or combinations
of cytokine measurements can be used to determine whether an
individual is affected by cerebral malaria (CM), the most severe
form of the disease, and how to distinguish CM from severe
malaria (SM). Both forms of the disease require early detection
and prognosis which are pressing matters for health caretakers.
We have computed from the entire dataset [including the controls
and patients with mild malaria (MM)] SVD-based and SVD—MDS-
based representations of the cytokine activity measurements in
covariance space (Fig. 5A and B). It becomes immediate evident

that whereas the representation by SVD—MDS identiﬁes TNFa
as having a major contribution to one of the higher principal
components, SVD alone does not reveal this prominent role for
TNFa leading to the conclusion that the main variability in the
patient samples is due to IL2, IL6 and TGFﬂ [Fig. 5C as opposed to
5D (SVD—MDS)]. The combination of IL2 and TNFa measurements
alone sufﬁces, however, to separate SM (red) from CM (blue)
patients in single linkage hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean
distances (Fig. 5E). The combination of IL2 and TNFa would
unlikely have been identiﬁed as effective by SVD alone (Fig. 5A).
The role of TNFa in CM has been also clariﬁed when investigating
the auto-immune component of CM in Bansal et al. (2009).

4 CONCLUSION

Dimensionality reduction of complex, high-dimensional data is an
important problem which becomes ever more complicated due to the
increase of data concomitant with an increase in their dimensionality.
This is particularly true for data from modern genomics analyses
where more and more data with thousands of instances each over
millions of variables are generated. We demonstrate here how a
combined molecular dynamics simulation multidimensional scaling
approach for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data can
be improved by better deﬁning the initial conditions. We have shown
that singular value decomposition is most effective to create an initial
condition for MDS. Using links between SVD and different standard
data analysis methods, we demonstrate how our combined SVD—
MDS method can be used to improve geometric representation in
low-dimensional space that are generally obtained with standard
analysis methods (PCA, classical scaling, PCCA, correspondence
analysis). We also show that the use of iterative reduction or

stochastic energy does not increase performance of the algorithms
in terms of ﬁnding a optimal solution. Finally, we have investigated
the local structure deformation induced by dimensionality reduction,
and conﬁrmed the superior accuracy of the SVD—MDS. Overall, the
methodology developed here should further advance our capacity
to analyze high-dimensional data such as the ones produced by
ﬁinctional genomics approaches.

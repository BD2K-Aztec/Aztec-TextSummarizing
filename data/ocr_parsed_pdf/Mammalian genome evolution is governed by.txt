Abstract

Genomic evolution is shaped by a dynamic combination of mutation, selection and genetic drift.
These processes lead to evolutionary rate variation across loci and among lineages. In turn,
interactions between these two forms of rate variation can produce residual effects, whereby the
pattern of among—lineage rate heterogeneity varies across loci. The nature of rate variation is
encapsulated in the pacemaker models of genome evolution, which differ in the degree of import—
ance assigned to residual effects: none (Universal Pacemaker), some (Multiple Pacemaker) or total
(Degenerate Multiple Pacemaker). Here we use a phylogenetic method to partition the rate
variation across loci, allowing comparison of these pacemaker models. Our analysis of 431 genes
from 29 mammalian taxa reveals that rate variation across these genes can be explained by 13
pacemakers, consistent with the Multiple Pacemaker model. We find no evidence that these pace—
makers correspond to gene function. Our results have important consequences for understanding

the factors driving genomic evolution and for molecular—clock analyses.

1 Introduction

The evolutionary process leaves genomic signatures that can be ana—
lyzed using phylogenetic methods. For example, methods based on mo—
lecular clocks can be used to estimate evolutionary rates and timescales
(Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1962). However, these methods must ac—
count for the complexities of molecular evolution at the genomic scale,
which is governed by interactions between mutation, selection and
drift. These factors lead to different patterns of rate variation among
lineages and across loci (Gaut et (11., 2011; Ho and Duchéne, 2014)
Factors that cause rate disparities across loci are known as gene
effects. Gene effects can be partly attributed to differences in the
strength and direction of selection between genes, which lead to
disparities in the proportion of sites that are free to vary (Dickerson,
1971). Evolutionary rates can also vary substantially among
lineages, owing to differences in generation time, DNA repair mech—
anisms and other traits (Bromham, 2009). These forms of rate

variation are known as lineage effects (Gillespie, 1989). Lineage and
gene effects can co—occur, leading to a pattern of among—lineage rate
variation that is sustained across genes, but with differences among
the absolute gene—specific rates.

A more complex pattern arises from the interaction between
gene and lineage effects, known as residual effects (Gillespie, 1989).
Under this scenario, the pattern of among—lineage rate variation can
differ across loci. This can occur if selective constraints vary across
loci in a lineage—specific manner (Muse and Gaut, 1997). For
example, a set of genes might be under positive selection in some
lineages, but under purifying selection in other lineages (Gaut et (11.,
2011). Changes in population size can also cause residual effects
because they alter the proportion of sites that are effectively neutral
(Takahata, 1987).

Partitioning rate variation into gene, lineage and residual effects is
difficult (Smith and Eyre—Walker, 2003), but the inﬂuence of these

model, the evolutionary rate is constant among lineages but varies across
genes. In the Universal Pacemaker (UPM) model, the evolutionary rate varies
across genes and among lineages. However, all genes share the same
pattern of among-lineage rate variation. In the Multiple Pacemaker (MPM)
model, groups of genes share the same pattern of among-lineage rate
variation. In the Degenerate Multiple Pacemaker (DMPM) model, each gene
has a distinct pattern of among-lineage rate variation

 

 

 

 

 

 

three factors at the genomic scale can be described using the pace—
maker models of molecular evolution (Fig. 1; Ho 2014; Snir et al.
2012). The Universal Molecular Clock (MC) is the simplest model of
genomic evolution (Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1962). It posits a con—
stant rate of evolution among lineages, but allows the rate to vary
across loci. In this model, rate variation is governed by gene effects
only. The Universal Pacemaker (UPM) model assumes that both
lineage and gene effects are present, but that residual effects are negli—
gible. Therefore, a single pattern of among—lineage rate variation is
shared across all loci. The Multiple Pacemaker (MPM) model
suggests that there is a limited number of pacemakers, such that there
are groups of genes with the same pattern of among—lineage rate
variation, but with different absolute rates. This implies that residual
effects within pacemakers are very small compared with those
between pacemakers. In the Degenerate Multiple Pacemaker
(DMPM) model, residual effects are pervasive and there is a distinct
pattern of among—lineage rate variation for each gene. This extreme
case of gene—specific among—lineage rate variation is also known as
‘erratic’ evolution (Ayala et (11., 1996; Rodriguez—Trelles et (11., 2001).

Support for the UPM model has come from studies of various or—
ganisms, including archaea, bacteria, plants, fungi and Drosophila
species (Snir et (11., 2012, 2014; Wolf et (11., 2013). In these analyses,
the UPM model was preferred over the MC, the MPM, and DMPM
models. These studies compared models using goodness—of—fit statis—
tics, but these are limited because they do not allow testing of all of
the possible scenarios under the MPM model. The MPM hypothesis
is much more complex than the UPM or the DMPM because it
comprises a large family of models: the n loci in a data set can be
assigned to one of k pacemakers, where k can take any value from 2
to n — 1. Given the large number of ways in which the loci can be

assigned to pacemakers, testing the goodness—of—fit of every scenario
under the MPM model is computationally intractable. This problem
can be overcome by using clustering algorithms (Duchéne and Ho,
2014; Snir, 2014).

Here, we analyze a publicly available data set of 431 genes from
29 mammalian taxa to test the different pacemaker models. We
tested the UPM model using a clustering algorithm implemented in a
new version of our program, ClockstaR (Duchéne et (11., 2014),
which we have modified so that it can be used to analyze genome—
scale data sets. We find that the patterns of evolutionary rate
variation in the mammalian data set can be explained by 13 pace—
makers, supporting the MPM model. Our results suggest that there
is a degree of stability in genome evolution. However, we find no
evidence of association between pacemakers and gene function.

2 Methods

We compiled a publicly available data set comprising 431 nuclear
protein—coding genes from 33 mammalian taxa (Song et (11., 2012).
We removed four taxa (horse, New World bat, Old World bat and
tree shrew) because their phylogenetic placement in most gene trees
did not match that in the species tree, leaving 29 taxa. This is a cru—
cial requirement of our method, which assumes the same topology
across all gene trees. We did not analyze the data sets from previous
studies of the pacemaker models (Snir et (11., 2012, 2014; Wolf et (11.,
2013) because they do not meet this assumption. Moreover, they
contain large proportions of missing data, which can mislead the
estimates of tree distances that form an important component of our
analysis.

To evaluate the MPM model, we estimated gene—trees under
maximum—likelihood implemented in phangorn v1.99 (Schliep,
2011). For each gene we selected the nucleotide substitution model
according to the Bayesian information criterion. We optimized the
branch lengths by fixing the tree topology to the species tree inferred
for these data (Song et (11., 2012). We analyzed the gene trees using a
modified version of the ClockstaR algorithm (Duchéne et (11., 2014),
ClockstaR—G.

The algorithm in ClockstaR—G involves scaling the length of
each gene tree to 1. This step controls for the possibility that genes
differ in their absolute evolutionary rates, and allows us to focus on
the proportional differences among branch lengths (i.e. the pattern
of among—lineage rate variation). The scaled branch lengths are used
as individual dimensions in Euclidean space to calculate the distance
between trees. This is possible because all genes are assumed to
share the same topology, such that we always compare the same
branches among genes. In this respect, trees with similar patterns of
among—lineage rate variation are expected to have small pairwise
distances between them. A pacemaker is a cluster of trees in this
space. For example, under the MC and the UPM models (Fig. 1),
there is a single cluster of gene trees with pairwise distances of 0. In
the MPM model, there is more than one cluster of gene trees, and
the gene—tree distances within each cluster are necessarily smaller
than those between clusters. In the DMPM model, the gene trees are
randomly distributed across Euclidean space, such that it is not
possible to identify discrete clusters. Clustering algorithms can be
used to identify the pacemakers. ClockstaR—G uses the Clustering
for Large Applications (CLARA) algorithm, which is efficient for
large data sets (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 2005).

The optimal number of clusters can be identified via the Gap
statistic (Tibshirani et (11., 2001). We use CLARA to assign genes to
each of the [2 clusters and we calculate the average silhouette width

(($12)), a measure of clustering fit (Rousseeuw, 1987). We then draw
a number of random samples equal to the number genes from a
multidimensional uniform distribution with the same dimensions
and range of values as those of the gene trees. We cluster these sam—
ples using CLARA and we calculate ($12) for every value of k. We
replicate this procedure 500 times. The Gap statistic is computed by
subtracting the ($12) estimated for the original data from ($12) esti—
mated for randomly drawn samples, such that there is a range of
Gap]z values for every [2. The optimal k is that with the highest aver—
age Gapk, ((Gapk)) and for which the 95% confidence interval does
not overlap with that of Gapk,1 (Tibshirani et (11., 2001). (512) can—
not be computed for k : 1 or for k : N. In these cases, the 95% con—
fidence intervals of successive values of k are expected to overlap
consistently. To select [2:2, Gap2 should not overlap with Gap3.
ClockstaR—G allows the computation of ($12) across different CPUs.
The program is written in the R programming language v3.0.1 (R
Core Team, 2008) and is freely available from an online repository
(github.com/sebastianduchene/clockstarg).

We calculated the isolation and mean dissimilarity for the each
of the pacemakers under the optimal k. The isolation is used to
determine whether a cluster is well separated from other clusters,
with low values indicating a high degree of separation. The mean
dissimilarity measures the average cohesiveness of a cluster, with
low values indicating that the points within a cluster are in close
proximity. According to these statistics, a pacemaker is well defined
if it has low values for the isolation and mean dissimilarity.

In ClockstaR—G, the UPM and the MC models are indistinguish—
able because the tree distance used here is expected to be 0 in both
cases. We tested the MC model by concatenating the genes and
analyzing the data in baseml, part of the PAML package v4.8
(Yang, 2007). The substitution model was chosen according to the
Bayesian information criterion. We used a likelihood—ratio test to
compare the fit of a free—rates model, in which there are no
constraints on branch lengths, against a strict—clock model.

We used a simulation approach to test the sensitivity of our clus—
tering method to detect different numbers of pacemakers. This
involved simulating [2 trees, each with branch lengths drawn from a
different lognormal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard de—
viation of 30% of the mean. In our method of generating trees, the
branch lengths in a tree are independently and identically distrib—
uted, as is commonly assumed in phylogenetic analyses (e.g.
Ronquist et (11., 2012). We simulated the evolution of 431 nucleotide
alignments with the same sequence length and substitution model
parameters as those of the mammalian genes. The trees were
rescaled to match the individual gene—tree lengths. We simulated a
similar number of gene alignments along each of the [2 trees. For
example, for k : 10 there were nine pacemakers with 43 genes each
and one pacemaker with 44. We chose values for k of 1, 2, 5, 10,
13, 100 and 431. To analyze these data, we used the same method
as that for the mammalian genes. We replicated our simulations five
times for each [2. This method allows us to assess the expected
results under the UPM (k : 1), and the DMPM (k : 431).

Given that, in the MPM model, all genes are assigned to a
limited number of pacemakers, the question arises as to whether
these pacemakers are associated with any features of the genes. For
example, genes with similar features might be subject to the same se—
lective constraints across a range of taxa, leading to similar patterns
of among—lineage rate variation. To answer this question, we ana—
lyzed the correspondence between pacemakers and several gene fea—
tures: sequence length, nucleotide composition, protein family, C—G
content and gene—tree length. We included these features in a classifi—
cation tree and in a random forest with the pacemaker assignment

as the target variable, as implemented in the R packages Tree v1.0
(Ripley, 2014) and RandomForest v4.6 (Liaw and Wiener, 2002).

The classification—tree algorithm uses one gene feature at a time
as a binary classifier, known as a decision node. The features are
added recursively to the tree until all the genes are classified into
pacemaker. Notably, a particular feature can be used at multiple
nodes in the tree. To avoid over—fitting, the least informative nodes
are pruned by using a k—fold cross—validation (Hastie et (11., 2009).
The features can be ranked in terms of their importance by counting
the number of times that they are used in the tree. The random forest
is an ensemble learning method that uses a large number of classifi—
cation trees (Breiman, 2001). In this algorithm, feature importance
is determined by removing one feature at a time, and computing the
increase in misclassification error. We chose these methods over
other classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, because
they do not make parametric assumptions and because the inclusion
of categorical predictor variables is straightforward.

3 Results and discussion

The MC model provided a poor fit to the concatenated alignment of
mammalian genes. The log—likelihood of the unconstrained model
(—8 400 383) was much higher than that of the strict—clock model
(—8 463 250), such that the MC model was strongly rejected
(P < 0.01).

Our test of the MPM model suggested that the optimal number
of pacemakers for this data set is 13, with (Gap13) : 0.14, compared

with (Gapn) : 0.053 and (Gap14) : 0.07. The 95% confidence
interval of Gap13 was 0.12—0.16, which did not overlap with those
of Gap12 or Gap14, which were 0.02—0.09 and 0.04—0.10, respect—
ively (Fig. 2). For the data simulated under the UPM (k: 1), the
95% confidence intervals between all successive values of [2 over—
lapped (Fig. 2). This indicated low support for all numbers of pace—
makers, such that the default value of [2:1 was selected. The
different trends in the Gap;z between the mammalian data and the
synthetic data generated according to the UPM model provide
strong evidence in support of the MPM model. Our simulations of a
range of values of [2 demonstrated that our method almost always
identified the correct number of pacemakers, at least under the
idealized conditions represented by simulated data. The exceptions
were two simulations with k : 100, for which the method detected
101 and 97 pacemakers (Supplementary Fig. S1).

There was high variation in the isolation and mean dissimilarity
of the pacemakers. However, some pacemakers had large numbers
of genes with low mean dissimilarities, suggesting that a large pro—
portion of genes had patterns of among—lineage rate variation that
were very similar to each other. For example, pacemaker PM1
included 257 genes with a mean dissimilarity of 2.98, which is lower
than that of most of the other pacemakers (Table 1). The most
isolated pacemakers, such as PM10 through PM13, had small
numbers of genes. This probably occurs because some genes have
distinct patterns of among—lineage rate variation, such that they are
equidistant to two or more clusters and the algorithm assigns them
uniquely to a pacemaker.

We did not find a clear association between the gene features
and the pacemaker assignments. There were high misclassification
errors for the classification tree (38%) and for the random forest
(40%), indicating that only approximately 60% of the genes could
be accurately assigned to a pacemaker on the basis of gene features.
Therefore, the pacemakers governed clusters of genes with different
functions and molecular characteristics, such as nucleotide
composition.

The only gene feature with some explanatory power was gene—
tree length, which was the most frequent variable in the classifica—
tion tree and was the most important variable in the random forest.
This variable allowed us to distinguish between PM1 and PM2,
which are the largest pacemakers and which have a mean difference
in tree length of 0.25 substitutions/site (Table 1). This is perhaps
because long trees are a consequence of high rates of evolution,
which imply weak selective constraints. In these cases, lineage effects

would be the dominant source of rate variation. In contrast, genes
that yield short trees might be subject to stronger selective con—
straints, such that they are governed by residual effects.
Consequently, there would be fewer pacemakers for genes with long
trees than for genes with short trees. This result stands in contrast
with those of Du et al. (2013), who did not find any relationship
between gene—specific evolutionary rates and the degree of among—
lineage rate heterogeneity. Further data from a range of taxonomic
groups will enable this hypothesis to be tested more
comprehensively.

Wolf et al. (2013) proposed that there is stability in among—lin—
eage rate variation throughout the genome. They showed that the
UPM model explains a large proportion of the gene—specific rate
variation among bacterial and archaeal lineages. Snir et al. (2014)
also found support for the UPM model in Drosolopila and yeast gen—
omes. Our analyses of the mammalian data set favor the MPM
model, but the number of pacemakers is small compared with the
total number of genes (13 pacemakers for 431 genes). This lends
support to the hypothesis of stable genome evolution because
genome—wide rate variation can be clustered into a small number of
pacemakers.

Our method has appeared to perform well in analyses of data
from simulations and mammals, but might be less reliable when the
level of within—cluster variation is high compared with that between
clusters. Further investigation of its performance under a wider
range of simulation scenarios, including its sensitivity to potential
confounding factors, will be valuable. In addition, improved genome
annotation and understanding of gene—specific functions will enable
elucidation of the factors that determine the number and inﬂuence
of genomic pacemakers. This opens the way for improving schemes
for assigning multiple relaxed—clock models in phylogenetic analyses
of evolutionary timescales (dos Reis et (11., 2012; Duchéne and Ho,
2014; Ho and Duchéne, 2014). Furthermore, analyzing the genomes
of a wider range of organisms will help to determine whether stabil—
ity is a ubiquitous property of genome evolution. Our method
provides a potential means of answering such questions about
patterns of evolutionary rate variation on a genomic scale.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Evaluating alternative multiple protein sequence
alignments is an important unsolved problem in Biology. The
most accurate way of doing this is to use structural information.
Unfortunately, most methods require at least two structures to be
embedded in the alignment, a condition rarely met when dealing with
standard datasets.

Result: We developed STRIKE, a method that determines the relative
accuracy of two alternative alignments of the same sequences using
a single structure. We validated our methodology on three commonly
used reference datasets (BAliBASE, Homestrad and Prefab). Given
two alignments, STRIKE manages to identify the most accurate one
in 70% of the cases on average. This figure increases to 79% when
considering very challenging datasets like the RV11 category of
BAliBASE. This discrimination capacity is significantly higher than
that reported for other metrics such as Contact Accepted mutation or
Blosum. We show that this increased performance results both from
a refined definition of the contacts and from the use of an improved
contact substitution score.

1 INTRODUCTION

The assembly of accurate multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is
one of the most important tasks in Biology. Judging from citation
index, MSA packages have become the most widely used tools for
biological sequence modeling. This should not come as a surprise
given their wide range of applications that include phylogenetic
tree reconstruction, proﬁle building and structural modeling. These
diverse modeling schemes are becoming increasingly important
in deﬁning the way experimental information is being transferred
across uncharacterized sequences. Yet, trees, proﬁles and structural
models all have one thing in common: their strong dependency on
the MSA framework they are based upon. For instance, it is well
established that homology modeling is very dependent on MSA
accuracy (Claude et (11., 2004; Zhang and Skolnick, 2004). In a
similar fashion, Wong et (11. (2008) have recently described the

inﬂuence of MSAs onto phylogenetic tree topologies, showing how
minor variations across different aligners can lead to signiﬁcantly
different tree topologies. Albeit these authors have not formally
established a direct dependency between MSA accuracy and proper
phylogenetic tree reconstruction, they have nonetheless shown the
existence of a strong methodological bias induced by the aligner’s
choice. More recently, Markova-Raina et (11. (2011) have used a
different set up to show how the use of different aligners can result
in signiﬁcantly different estimates for positive selection rates.

These observations confront biologists with a complex situation.
On the one hand, it is clear that the choice of an alignment strategy
will have an impact on any result drawn upon the MSAs; on the other
hand, there is no simple way to quantify this impact and determine
its positive or negative nature. Using sequence information alone,
it is very hard to decide which one is the best among two or
more alternative MSAs of the same sequences. This difﬁculty
stems from the impossibility of accurately aligning proteins with
<25% sequence identity using sequence information only. Sequence
similarity is only a useful indicator of alignment accuracy for closely
related sequences. The most biologically relevant alignment (deﬁned
with respect to structural information in stande datasets) is rarely
the one having the highest possible score (Sierk et (11., 2010). The
practical consequences of these observations are important as they
imply the need for external evaluation criteria in order to evaluate
MSAs in a biologically meaningful way.

The problem of estimating the biological relevance of an
alignment is particularly acute considering alternative MSA
methods. As shown in M-Coffee (Wallace et (11., 2006), different
packages tend to deliver signiﬁcantly different MSAs. Most
scientists address this problem by ignoring it and using a single
aligner [most frequently ClustalW (Thompson et (11., 2002)].
However, for those ready to consider the aligner as yet another
parameter in a complex modeling pipeline, at least two sequence-
based solutions exist. The ﬁrst one involves combining all the
alternative alignments into one unique consensus MSA. This
approach has been shown to improve slightly on all the combined
methods (Wallace et (11., 2006). Along the same lines, it has also
been shown that regions showing a high agreement across methods
are also more likely to be correctly aligned, as estimated by
comparison with a reference MSA (Lassmann and Sonnhammer,
2005). The second approach is to evaluate the alignment for speciﬁc
features difﬁcult to take into account while building the MSA,
but measurable on a complete model (e.g. completely conserved
positions) (Thompson et (11., 2003). The AlexSys (Aniba et (11., 2010)
strategy is built on this approach and combines features measured
on the unaligned sequences (length, divergence, etc.) to determine

the aligner that should give the best accuracy/efﬁciency trade off. In
practice, meta-methods tend to be slightly superior, as they beneﬁt
from the combination of MSAs, but in any case, none of these two
approaches manages to fully recapitulate the accuracy estimations
one obtains when using structural information.

Structural information is the best conserved signal in proteins
across long evolutionary distances. This is the reason why structural
similarity comparisons have long been established as the acid test
for estimating or evaluating protein sequence alignments. For more
than a decade, multiple sequence aligners have been optimized
for their capacity to restitute structure-based MSAs. Unfortunately,
structural data are scarce and beyond well-established benchmarks,
the only realistic way to use that information is to embed within a
dataset at least two sequences with a known structure (O’Sullivan
et (11., 2004). One can then either build the MSA (by combining
sequences and structures) or estimate its accuracy (1 posteriori,
by evaluating the structural superposition implied by the sequence
alignment. This approach is very powerful, but remains hampered
by the two structures requirement, a prerequisite only met within a
small minority of protein families.

A very desirable solution would be to adapt this approach and
make it work with a single structure, so as to deal with the rapidly
growing number of globular protein families having at least one
structurally resolved member. This can be achieved by aligning any
sequence with another homologous sequence having a known 3D
structure. One can then evaluate the structural correctness of the
potential contacts projected from the structure via the alignment
on the ﬁrst sequence. This strategy is applied in the development
of fold recognition methods (also called threading) (Bowie et (11.,
1991; Jones et (11., 1992; Marin et (11., 2002; Wu and Zhang,
2008), where the compatibility between a query sequence and
a template structure is assessed by knowledge-based potentials
extracted from highly resolved protein structures. Over time many
other potentials have been developed either based on physical
principals or taking into account more empirical data like residue
spatial environment. Such methods include Verify3D (Luthy et (11.,
1992), ProsaII (Sippl, 1993), MIGeval (Taly et (11., 2008) or Fugue
(Shi et (11., 2001). While threading had originally been designed
mostly for the recognition of remote homology relationship, it is
only recently that its potential for the improvement of MSAs has
also been considered. In 2004, O’Sullivan et (11. used the T—Coffee
package to combine threading and structure-alignment methods.
Their results, however, were inconclusive and suggested that the
contribution of threading to the MSA of sequences and structures
to be relatively modest. More recently, Lin et (11. (2003) addressed
the same problem from a different perspective. Rather than using
threading in order to improve the alignments, they asked if the
equivalent of threading potentials could be used to measure the
relative accuracy of alternative MSAs. Their approach relied on
the computation of a contact substitution matrix [Contact Accepted
mutation (CAO)]. The rationale behind CAO is that contacts should
be preserved by evolution as they constitute the main network
of interactions within a protein fold, a highly conserved feature
in proteins. Unfortunately, the estimation of the CA0 matrix was
hampered by the limited amount of available data with respect to the
high dimensionality of the matrix. Indeed, the matrix contains one
entry for each pair of possible contacts which makes a total of 400 X
400 entries. To estimate this matrix, one needs pairwise alignments
of sequences with known structures, a relatively rare commodity.

As a consequence, the CA0 matrix is largely underdetermined and
lacks the statistical power it would need to achieve its initial goal of
discriminating between alignments of different accuracy.

In this work, we have approached the same problem as CAO,
but from a different angle. Rather than a contact matrix, we have
estimated a potential matrix, conceptually similar to that described
by Sippl (1993). Yet, in contrast to Sippl’s approach, our metric
[Single sTRucture Induced Evaluation (STRIKE)] relies on a purely
empirical matrix, whose estimation does not involve any Boltzmann
modeling. Since the STRIKE matrix does not require pairs of
homologous structures, far fewer parameters can be estimated
on a much larger dataset compared with CAO, thus avoiding
both underdetermination and overﬁtting problems. The rest of our
approach is conceptually similar to that used in CA0 and we show
here that STRIKE can be used to compare alternative MSAs in terms
of their relative accuracy while using one structure only.

2 METHODS

2.1 Contact estimation

Intramolecular contacts were estimated using the Connolly framework
(Connolly, 1983) where two atoms are considered to interact if a solvent
molecule cannot be inserted between their molecular surfaces. Following
common practice, water molecules were approximated with a single oxygen
atom. An all-atom representation of protein structures was used here. This
approach departs signiﬁcantly from that of Lin et a1. (2003), who only
considered interactions between spheres representing the residue side chains
(coarse-grained C5 atoms). Previous results (Taly at (11., 2008), based on
molecular dynamics simulations suggest that such an approximation is not
precise enough to reﬂect the complexity of existing interactions. In order to
avoid any bias introduced by near-neighbor interactions (172, 173, 141-, 175),
that dominate secondary structure contacts, we have only considered long-
range residue-to-residue contacts, involving two amino acids separated by at
least ﬁve amino acids within the primary structure. Three types of contacts
are considered here: main chain to main chain (MCPMC) contacts involving
only atoms forming part of the protein backbone, side chain to side chain
(SCPSC) made of side chain atoms and ALLPALL in which atoms from
either subset may form the contact.

2.2 Structural dataset

We assembled a dataset of non-redundant protein structures from the
ASTRAL database (Chandonia at (11., 2004) (version 1.75), a high-quality
protein domain collection derived from the SCOP database (Murzin at (11.,
1995) and the Protein Data Bank (Berman et (11., 2000). We followed the
CA0 strategy by ﬁrst ﬁltering out all low-resolution structures having an
AEROSPACI score (Chandonia at (11., 2004) <0.5. The resulting subset was
further trimmed by keeping only structures with <40% sequence identity at
the pairwise level. The result was a dataset of 5242 structures, comprising a
total of 979 934 residues and referred to as the ASTRAL subset in the rest
of the text.

2.3 Contact matrix calculation

Using the reference structural dataset as a source for amino acid frequencies
and contacts, we estimated a log-odds contact matrix by measuring the ratio
between the frequency of each possible contact and its expectation given the
background frequency of each single amino acid. Albeit it captures a different
kind of signal, this matrix is conceptually comparable to a Blosum (Henikoff
and Henikoff, 1992) or a PAM (Dayhoff at (11., 1979) matrix. Given any pair
of amino acids 1 and j, the score for their contact can be estimated as:

where ﬂy is the frequency of contacts involving 1 and j across all observed
residueiresidue contacts, f, and are the single residue frequencies in the
considered dataset. This formula therefore amounts to estimate whether the
two considered residues 1 and j are more (or less) often in contact than
one would expect by chance. In this framework, positive values imply an
evolutionary favored contact, whereas negative values imply a disfavored
contact. This approach deﬁnes the STRIKE matrix, displayed in Figure 1.
Note that the analysis presented was carried out with full precision values
(Supplementary Material).

2.4 Matrix entropy calculation

The formula below estimates the entropy of a matrix. This measure reﬂects
the average information gain per aligned residue (as deﬁned by Shannon)
and may be described as an estimate of how much the considered matrix
departs from the null model (zero average information gain). In the context
of this work, we used the formula of Henikoff and Henikoff (1992) and Yu
et a1. (2003).

i]. [7in

where pi]- is the probability for i and j to be in contact while [7, and p]- are the
probability of their occurrence in the sequences. Probabilities were estimated
using frequencies measured on the structural dataset.

2.5 Random model estimation

For the sake of validation, 1000 random matrices were generated and
compared with the STRIKE matrix. These were obtained by randomizing
the ASTRAL subset sequences using the original amino acid frequencies.
We concatenated all sequences, shufﬂed them and split them up again. The
random sequences were then projected onto the cognate structure and used to
derive random contact counts. Note that no 3D modeling has been performed
and the contacts were those estimated on the bonaﬁde structure.

2.6 Alignment evaluation

Given an alignment between a sequence with a known structure (Template)
and a sequence of unknown structure (Target), the STRIKE score is estimated
by projecting all the contacts measured on the template onto the target. The
scores of these induced contacts cicj (as given by the STRIKE matrix) are
then summed up and normalized by the total number of contacts |C| within
the template.

ZSTRIKE(cicj-) >< IsContact(cic]-)
Score(Target) = 0+ ,
c

1, if c, cj are in contact
IsContact (cicj) = .

Given a MSA A, the scores for each of the N target sequences are then
added up to yield to the ﬁnal alignment score

STRIKEan(A):

N
STRIKEan(A)= Z

i 75 Template.

Score(Targeti)

Whereas this formula has no explicit gap penalty, in practice the
normalization by the number of contacts in the template plays a similar role
and target sequences missing many contacts because of unaligned residues
end up with a global score lowered accordingly.

The contact score can be further normalized by dividing its value with that
of the Template sequence. This measure gives an indication as to whether the
overall score of the Target sequences is signiﬁcantly lower (<1), comparable
(:1) or higher (>1) than that of the only known structure.

2.7 Validation databases

The various scoring schemes described above were tested on three different
reference collections: BAliBASE3 (Thompson et (11., 2005), Homstrad
(Mizuguchi 61611., 1998) and Prefab (Edgar 2004). These collections are made
of structure-based sequence alignments. It is a common practice to consider
these alignments as gold standards when evaluating multiple aligners.
BAliBASE3 consists of six subsets of structural reference alignments,
with a total of 379 usable alignments with empirically deﬁned core
regions. Homstrad is also made of multiple structure-based sequence
alignments. In the context of this work, we only kept the 233 alignments
containing more than four sequences. Prefab4 is one of the most extensive
databases. It contains 1682 structure-based pairwise sequence alignments.
Each structure comes along with ~25 homologous sequences, thus making
up datasets of ~50 sequences with two known structures. The datasets come
along with core regions deﬁned by the agreement between two structural
aligners.

2.8 Evaluation of datasets

Reference databases are normally used to determine the accuracy of an
aligner. Sequences are aligned with the chosen aligner whose merits are then
quantiﬁed by a comparison of its output with the reference alignment. In
the context of this work, we were not so much concerned with establishing
the accuracy of an aligner, but rather with a comparison of the STRIKE
score with established evaluation metrics on the output of different aligners.
Therefore, a number of different MSA evaluation metrics was used here.
First, the companion scores of some databases (BaliScore for BAliBASE,
qscore for Prefab) were used in order to establish the absolute accuracy of
each individual MSA tested in this study. As reference score (RS) we used
the sum-of-pair scores, which denote the proportion of amino acid pairs
that are aligned in the test alignment the same way as in the reference.
The same MSAs were also evaluated in terms of their sum-of—pair scores

(using a Blosum62 matrix), their CAO score and STRIKE score using the
metrics has been deﬁned earlier in this section.

3 RESULTS

Our ﬁrst task was to determine which type of contact yields the
most informative log-odds substitution matrix: for this we checked
the MC—MC, SC—SC and ALL—ALL contacts. We determined the
corresponding matrix values on the ASTRAL subset and measured
the entropy of the resulting matrix. As one would expect, the
side chain contacts are those yielding the most informative matrix.
Indeed, while the MC—MC matrix has an entropy of 0.06 and the
ALL—ALL has an entropy of 0.12, the SC—SC reaches 0.46. This
value is in the same range as that reported by Altschul (1991) for
the Blosum45 (0.4) and Blosum62 (0.7) matrix. In order to assess
the statistical signiﬁcance of this value, we generated 1000 random
matrices and found their entropies to be distributed normally, with
mean entropy of 2.7>< 10_4 and a SD of 3.8 ><10_5. Altogether
these results suggest that the SC—SC matrix (named STRIKE
matrix in the rest of this text) has all the desirable properties for
evaluating the conservation of contacts in MSAs. These ﬁnding is
in agreement with previous results (Taly et (11., 2008) where it is
shown that main chain contacts are less informative for the task of
discriminating correct 3D predicted models from incorrect ones if
the decoys are based on templates sharing structural motifs with the
native structure. MC atoms mainly contribute to the stabilization of
secondary structure elements and therefore constitute energetically
favorable components of the fold. In the context of STRIKE,
MC—MC connections disturb the signal because they increase the
frequency of contacts between residues not sharing the adequate
physicochemical properties for an interaction. As one can see in
Figure 1, the STRIKE matrix recapitulates quite well the best-
known properties of protein structures. For instance, the entry with
the highest score is the cystein—cystein interaction, an observation
that is in good agreement with the well-established importance of
disulﬁde bridges. Likewise, contacts between hydrophobic residues
interactions tend to have positive values, whereas contacts between
charged residues with the same sign (+1 or — 1) have a clear negative
trend. The interactions between amino acids with opposite charges
are only slightly positive, as one would expect given the tendency
of these residues to interact with the solvent rather than forming salt
bridges within the hydrophobic core.

Only glycine contacts remained undetermined, owing to the lack
of a side chain. The corresponding entries were set to 0. It is
interesting to note that the matrix is slightly asymmetric. This reﬂects
the underlying asymmetry of residue—residue interactions along the
peptide chain. Indeed, the contacts are determined in Nter—> Cter
direction and can therefore not be assumed to be reversible. The
most asymmetric entry is the proline—tryptophan interaction, with
P—> W=5 and W—>P=7. Aside from this extreme observation,
most of the other values have limited variation when comparing the
Nter —> Cter with the Cter —> Nter entry.

Our next task was to estimate whether the STRIKE method is
suited to discriminate between accurate and less accurate sequence
alignments (accuracy being deﬁned with respect to the reference
alignment). For this purpose, we estimated the correlation between
the reference score (RS, as produced by the BAliBASE3 program
BaliScore) and the normalized STRIKE score (see Section 2
for details). For each dataset, a STRIKE score was computed

independently for each structure and its related sequences (i.e.
one sequence with known structure was used as a template while
others were considered as targets). The result is displayed in
Figure 2. The resulting correlation with a Pearson’s coefﬁcient of
r=0.54 (Spearman’s rho=0.51) is very weak. Nonetheless, the
graph suggests the existence of a trend in the relation between
structure-based accuracy estimates and STRIKE scores.

Our goal was not so much to estimate the MSA accuracy in
absolute terms, but rather to tell apart two or more alternative
alignments of the same structure/sequence pair. For that purpose,
we were therefore more concerned with the existence of a non-
parametric correlation allowing such comparisons. A non-parametric
correlation exists whenever the relation of order deﬁned between
two observations is similar across the two considered metrics. For
instance, if the reference score indicates that a T—Coffee MSA is
more accurate than its ClustalW counterpart, the relation of order is
conserved if the STRIKE score of the T—Coffee MSA is superior to
the ClustalW MSA STRIKE score. In order to estimate the existence
of such a non-parametric correlation, we computed alternative
alignments of each available dataset using seven methods: ClustalW
(Thompson et (11., 1994), Mafft (Katoh et (11., 2005), Muscle (Edgar,
2004), PCMA (Pei et (11., 2003), POA (Grasso and Lee, 2004),
Probcons (Do et (11., 2005) and T—Coffee (Notredame et (11., 2000).
We also included the reference alignments themselves, and treated
them as an eighth additional method. We then computed the RS for
each MSA, using the evaluation package suitable for the considered
reference dataset resulting in a single accuracy score for each MSA.
Using the same alignments, we evaluated the scores we wanted to
test, including a Blosum62 sums-of—pairs, a Pam250 sums-of-pairs,
the CA0 score (one for each structure) and the STRIKE score. Given
any of these datasets and two alternative alignments generated with
two different methods, we plotted the difference in RS versus the
difference in the test score.

The results obtained on the RV11 component of the BAliBASE
3 data when comparing the difference in RS with the difference in
STRIKE scores are shown in Figure 3. In this graph, each point
corresponds to one dataset, aligned with two different aligners.

Fig. 3. Comparison of A BaliScore and A STRIKE score on BAliBASE3 RV11 using alignments produced by T-Coffee, Mafft and ClustalW as well as the
reference alignment. All points which have the same algebraic sign are correctly classiﬁed.

The horizontal axis indicates the difference of RS between the
two MSAs while the vertical axis represents the difference in
STRIKE score (considering the same template structure). The
total number of points is therefore a product of the number of
datasets, the number of structures they contain and the number of
possible pairwise method comparisons. As suggested by Figure 2,
the absolute correlation between these differences is relatively weak.
Nonetheless, observations made in Figure 3 suggest a very strong
non-parametric correlation. Indeed, the two quadrants corresponding
to RS differences and STRIKE differences having the same sign
contain the most data points (top right and bottom left quadrant).
In total, a signiﬁcant proportion of 79% of the points fall into these
quadrants. Note that the striped patterns that can be seen on this
graph result from the same MSA being evaluated several times for its
STRIKE score (once for each structure it contains). By deﬁnition, the
reference alignments (red squares) always have the highest accuracy
and it is interesting to note that a vast majority of these reference
alignments are in the proper quadrants of the graph.

A graph like the one shown on Figure 3 can be summarized
with an estimate of the fraction of measures falling within the two
‘correct’ quadrants. We therefore repeated the same analysis on
the whole BAliBASE3, Prefab3 and Homstrad databases in order
to compare the effect of using different metrics like sequence-
based measures (PAM and Blosum) or CAO. The results are
summarized in Table 1. It is interesting to note that these results are
in broad agreement across the three datasets. As one would expect,
the sequence-based measures (PAM and Blosum) have a limited
capacity of discriminating MSAs for their structural accuracy.
Overall, using them to rank two alignments is only slightly more
accurate than ﬂipping a coin (50—55%). Surprisingly, the CAO-based
metrics is not signiﬁcantly more informative than a direct sequence
analysis. This surprising result is most likely a consequence of
the underdetermination of the CA0 substitution matrices. The last
column summarizes the tests carried out with STRIKE. It shows
that in this context, our approach yields the best results. On the
most challenging dataset (RV1 1, made of distantly related sequences
with a known 3D structure), the discrimination capacity of STRIKE
is >79%. On the rest of the datasets, this capacity ranges from 65%

considered here. Interestingly, this discriminative capacity seems
to be independent of the nature of the considered proteins and the
performances are relatively even when considering most structural
subclasses (Table 2). Categories with <50 members were excluded.

When using a method like STRIKE to estimate the relative
accuracy of two MSAs, it is important to have a notion of how

meaningful the score may be and whether it might be inﬂuenced
by the level of sequence identity in the considered dataset. We
therefore binned the results of the analysis presented in Table 1
according to the average level of sequence identity in the considered
MSAs (as estimated on the reference). Results are displayed in
Figure 4, where the color code indicates the fraction of residues
appearing in the ‘correct’ quadrants. The P-values were computed
using a two-sided binomial test with P0 = 0.5. Given two alignments
and a difference in STRIKE score, this ﬁgure gives an estimate of
how much trust one can have that the STRIKE difference reﬂects
the difference in structural accuracy. The strongest trend on this
graph is the poor level of information provided by STRIKE score
differences <0.25. It seems one can rarely use this level of difference
to effectively distinguish between two alternative alignments. Above
this value, if we ignore the situations with < 100 counts, the level of
information provided by a difference in STRIKE score is roughly
constant across all ranges of identity. With sequences within the
twilight zone (20—30%), differences of STRIKE score > 0.5 make
it possible to identify the most accurate MSA in nearly 90% of the
cases. On our datasets, such discrimination can be carried out on a
signiﬁcant fraction of the data.

The reason why our approach is much more informative than
CAO is not entirely clear. There are two main differences between
our method and CAO. First, our metric evaluates contacts rather
than the conservation of contacts. Second, the STRIKE matrix
was determined using all-atom contacts instead of coarse-grained
CIS spheres as in CA0. We therefore determined an additional
STRIKE matrix using the coarse-grained side chain contacts of
CA0 instead of the all-atom STRIKE contacts (Lin et al., 2003).
The resulting matrix has an entropy <03 and when tested on
Homestrad, it was only able to correctly classify 52% of the
alignments. While this ﬁgure is higher than that of CA0 itself
(46%), it is also signiﬁcantly lower than the original STRIKE matrix
whose improved performances are therefore quite likely to be a
combination of better contact estimation complemented with a larger
amount of usable information.

4 DSCUSSON

In this work, we present the STRIKE score, a new metric
using a single structure to estimate the structural correctness of
MSAs. We show that using STRIKE, one can distinguish between
alternative MSAs of the same sequences more reliably than when

using similarity based scoring schemes, like Blosum or PAM.
STRIKE is not the ﬁrst attempt to compare alternative MSAs
using the information from a single sequence, and in this work
we have extensively compared our approach with that developed
in CA0, which is conceptually similar albeit more complex in
its implementation. Our results suggest that comparisons based on
STRIKE result are more likely to reveal the most trustworthy MSA
than those using CAO. Two reasons explain this difference. First,
the STRIKE matrix is not estimated on structural alignments but
on single structures. Consequently, the STRIKE matrix could be
estimated on a much larger reference dataset. In comparison, the
CA0 matrix that considers the substitution cost for every contact pair
of amino acids was probably underdetermined. The second reason
for the reported improvement is the all-atom deﬁnition of contacts.
While CAO was determined using coarse-grained CIS side chain
contacts, STRIKE uses a more sophisticated deﬁnition of contacts
discriminating between side chains and backbone. We showed that
this choice accounts for the largest part of the difference between
CAO and STRIKE.

We also explored the factors inﬂuencing STRIKE’s capacity to
discriminate between accurate and inaccurate MSAs. Against our
expectation, we found the protein class to have only a weak inﬂuence
on the trustworthiness of STRIKE. On the datasets analyzed here,
the variations between all a, all 13 and 01—13 structures are <5
percentage points. We found that the differences in STRIKE scores
are most useﬁil when considering datasets with low average identity,
and unsurprisineg when the difference in the scores is high. For
instance, a STRIKE difference of 1 nat on a dataset with 30% average
sequence identity makes it possible to identify with a reliability close
to 90% the most correct of the two considered.

This makes STRIKE a potentially very useful tool to evaluate
the alternative MSAs. Indeed, following the work of Wong et (11.
(2008) on the uncertainty of phylogenetic trees, biologists are
now confronted with a complex situation. On the one hand, it
has now been established that alternative alignments can result in
signiﬁcantly different phylogenetic trees. On the other hand, no
solution has yet been provided as to how biologists should proceed
to select the most useful aligners or alignments. The method we
introduce here could conveniently address this issue by providing
users with an objective criterion to select the MSAs that are most
likely to be structurally correct. Such a criterion would also be useful
in the context of homology modeling.

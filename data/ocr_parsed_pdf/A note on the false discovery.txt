Abstract

Motivation: Proteogenomics has been well accepted as a tool to discover novel genes. In most
conventional proteogenomic studies, a global false discovery rate is used to filter out false posi—
tives for identifying credible novel peptides. However, it has been found that the actual level of
false positives in novel peptides is often out of control and behaves differently for different
genomes.

Results: To quantitatively model this problem, we theoretically analyze the subgroup false discov—
ery rates of annotated and novel peptides. Our analysis shows that the annotation completeness
ratio of a genome is the dominant factor influencing the subgroup FDR of novel peptides.
Experimental results on two real datasets of Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis sup—

 

port our conjecture.

1 Introduction

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)—based proteogenomics (Jaffe
et (11., 2004) has been applied to reﬁnement of annotated genes,
discovery of novel genes (Kim et (11., 2014), personal genomics and dis—
ease—related studies (Zhang et (11., 2014). Unlike traditional genomic
annotation techniques, such as in silico (ab initio or comparative) or
cDNA—seq—based methods, proteogenomics allows validating protein—
coding genes directly at the protein level, which is more favorable
(Renuse et (11., 2011). To identify novel genes, researchers usually search
the experimental MS/MS spectra against a large protein database that is
constructed from the genomic or transcriptomic sequences and filter the
search results to control the false discovery rate (FDR). It has been
observed previously that, under a ﬁxed FDR, the inﬂated database gen—
erated by, e.g. six—open—reading—frame (6—ORF) translation of a whole

genome significantly decreases the sensitivity of peptide identification
(Blakeley et (11., 2012). However, few studies probe into the effect
of the large database on the estimated FDR, especially for the novel
peptides.

Most proteogenomic studies estimate a global FDR for all pep—
tide identifications (Borchert et (11., 2010; Chaerkady et (11., 2011;
Merrihew et (11., 2008). That is, the identifications of annotated pep—
tides and novel peptides are subject to FDR estimation in combin—
ation. Some researchers noted the high actual FDR of novel peptides
and therefore employed more stringent filtering strategies, e.g. post
error probability (Brosch et (11., 2011) or separate FDRs for anno—
tated and novel peptides (Branca et (11., 2014). Recently, Krug et al.
(2013) highlighted that for well—annotated genomes, such as the
Escherichia coli genome, the post error probability distribution of

novel peptide hits is almost identical to that of decoy hits, indicating
that most novel peptides were false positives. Krug’s work implied
that the identification accuracy of novel peptides is greatly affected
by the completeness of genome annotation.

In fact, the relationship between annotated and novel peptides is
quite similar to that between unmodified and modified peptides.
Recently, Fu has formally studied the factors that inﬂuence the sub—
group FDRs of differently modified peptides (Fu, 2012; Fu and
Qian, 2014). Here, we follow the same framework as in Fu’s work
to quantitatively investigate the subgroup FDRs of annotated and
novel peptides identified by 6—ORF translation search.

2 Methods

Let subscript k E {ann. new} denote the subgroup of annotated
(arm) and novel (new) peptide identifications, respectively. Here, the
novel peptides are those from the previously unannotated region on
a genome, excluding the peptide variants resulting from DNA muta—
tion or mRNA alternative splicing. Then following Fu’s formaliza—
tion, we define (i) T, a true peptide identification; (ii) F, a false
peptide identification; (iii) 1),, a peptide identification belonging to
subgroup [2; (iv) FDR(x), the global FDR of peptide identifications
that score better than x, where both annotated and novel peptides
are included; (v) FDRk(x), the subgroup FDR, e.g. FDRam(x) for
annotated peptides and FDRnew(x) for novel ones. Following the
derivation by Fu and Qian (2014), FDR;a can be written as

FDR(x)
FDR(x) + W (1 — FDR(x)> 7

Pa, lF,X>x)

FDRk(x) : (1)

 

where P(IkIT,X > x) is the probability that an identification be—
longs to subgroup [2 under the condition that this identification is
true and scores better than x, and P(IkIF.X > x) is the probability
that an identification belongs to subgroup [2 under the condition
that this identification is false and scores better than x. Equation (1)
implies that FDR;a is determined by three variables, i.e. FDR(x),
P(IkIT,X > x) and P(IkIF,X > 

To make the relationship in Equation (1) computable, we need to
evaluate P(IkIT.X > x) and P(IkIF.X > x), for both annotated and
novel peptides. Note that we assume FDR(x) can be readily estimated
using some methods, e.g. the commonly used target—decoy search
strategy (Elias and Gygi, 2007). For convenience of discussion, we
introduce two quantities: (i) 0, the annotation completeness ratio,
defined as the length ratio of the currently annotated genes to all genes
on the genome; (ii) p, the annotation length ratio, defined as the
length ratio of currently annotated genes to the whole genome.
Presuming that only one gene exists at any genomic locus, the value
scope of u is [0. 1]. Actually, u varies across species even if their gen—
omes are well annotated (for E.coli it is about 0.88 and for Homo sa-
piens, it is less than 0.02). However, for a poorly annotated genome,
u is relatively small, and we have u : 0 if no gene is annotated.

Suppose that the annotated and novel peptides could be equally
likely retrieved by the search engine and their scores are identically
distributed, then apparently, we have P(IamIT.X > x) : 0 and
P(InewlT,X > x) : 1 — 0. P(IkIF,X > x) depends on the sizes of the
annotated database and the translated database. Given the gen—
ome length L, the summed length of annotated genes is uL. If
falsely identified peptides distribute uniformly on the genome, we
have P(IamIF,X > x): uL/6L : 11/6 and P(IHEWIF,X > x):
(6 — u) / 6. So far, we have obtained the probabilities that an identi—
fied peptide is an annotated or novel peptide given that this

identification is true or false and scores better than x, as summarized
in Table 1.
Now we first come to the formulation of FDRam,

FDR(x)

FDR(x) + 6—3 (1 — FDR(x)> I I

FDRam (x) :

The value of 11/0 represents the length proportion of all genes on the
genome and is a constant for a certain species. Therefore, we can
conclude that FDRam, depends only on FDR(x).

Similarly, we can write FDRnew as

FDR(x)

FDmepc) : —.
FDR(x) + “QT—f) (1 — FDR(x)>

(3)

If a genome has never been annotated (0: 0, u: 0), then
no identification could be an annotated peptide and
FDRnew : FDR(x), which is consistent with the assumption. If a
genome is completely annotated (0 : 1), then FDRnew(x) : 1, mean—
ing that all novel peptide identifications are false, which is also con—
sistent with the assumption; in this case, as FDR(x) and u are
usually very small, FDRam, approximately equals 11/ 6 of FDR(x).
If we take FDR(x) : 1%, the FDRam(x) is only 1.5% for E.coli
(u: 0.88) and 0.03% for H.sapiens (u < 0.02), much more conser—
vative than FDR(x). On the other hand, if we assume 0 : 0.999, p
: 0.6 and FDR(x) : 1%, then we have P(I,,EWIT.X > x) : 1/1000
and P(InewIF.X > x) :9/10. The calculated FDRnew(x) is 90.1%,
as large as 90 times of FDR(x). In contrast, the FDRam,(x) is only
1%). We can see that for well annotated genomes, FDRam, is over—
estimated, while FDRnew(x) is underestimated, if a global FDR is
controlled.

Since 0 S u S 1, we have 5/6 S P(InewIF.X > x) S 1. It is easy
to deduce from Equation (3) that u, as a parameter quantitatively re—
ﬂecting the length ratio of the annotated genes to the whole genome,
has little inﬂuence on FDRnew(x). Let us take FDR(x) : 1%, then
for different 0, the upper and lower bounds (occurring when u : 0
and u : 1, respectively) of FDRnew(x) can be calculated and are de—
picted by the dashed blue and solid red lines, respectively, in Figure
1. It is worth emphasizing that FDRnew is less than 10% if 0 does
not exceed 90%. However, as 0 increases over 90%, FDRnew(x)
ramps up quickly to a much higher level. Thus, we conclude that 0
significantly affects FDRnew(x). Nevertheless, given FDR(x) : 1%,
the maximum difference between the upper and lower bounds of
FDRnew(x) is less than 4.6%, and thus u does not substantially
change FDRnew (x), just as we deduced above.

3 Results

By removing some genes from a completely annotated database
based on their summed length, we could perform numerical simula—
tion of 0. Then, experimental FDRam(x), which is the ratio of the
number of identified annotated decoys to the number of annotated
targets, and FDRnew (x), which is the ratio of the number of identified
novel decoys to the number of novel targets, can be calculated and
compared to the theoretical ones [computed by Equations (2) and
(3)]. On the basis of this idea, we experimentally validated our theor—
etical model on two species, i.e. E.coli and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.

3.1 Results on E.coli

Krug et al. (2013) concluded that the E.coli genome might have
achieved a complete annotation. We downloaded one of these
E.coli’s datasets from PeptideAtlas, which consisted of six raw files

resulting in a combined target—decoy database to facilitate FDR esti—
mation (Elias and Gygi, 2007). Next, the MS/MS spectra were
searched against the combined database using pFind studio (version
2.8). Peptides were digested in silico with up to two missed cleavages
allowed, and carbamidomethylation on cysteine was set as the fix
modification and oxidation on methionine as the variable modifica—
tion. The precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set
to i 20 ppm and i 0.5 Da, respectively. A global peptide—level FDR
of 1% was used for quality assessment, which allowed us to identify
12 835 peptides. Among these peptides, 113 were contaminant ones,
12619 were annotated ones and 103 were novel ones. Since the
E.coli’s genome has been almost completely annotated, the 103
novel target identifications should be mostly false ones. Just as ex—
pected, among the 128 decoy identifications above the threshold of
FDR < 1 %, 97 were novel decoys, very close to the number of novel
targets, indicating that the subgroup FDR of novel peptides was
close to 1 (97/103 : 0.94).

To simulate 0, we randomly removed some genes from the
annotated database to vary the ratio of their summed length to
all genes. Using the same global FDR threshold of 1%, we ob—
tained the numbers of targets and decoys separately on anno—
tated and novel peptides, allowing us to calculate the
experimental FDRam(x) and FDRnew(x). Given 0 and u, the the—
oretical FDRam,(x) and FDRnew(x) were also calculated through
Equations (2) and (3). Our simulation showed that, the experi—
mental FDRam(x) were close to the theoretical value of 1.5%),
with a minimum of 2.1%) and a maximum of 3.6%). Moreover,
the experimental FDRnew(x) fits well with the theoretical coun—
terpart, as shown in Figure 2A. On the other hand, we can de—
duce the value of 0 from the experimental FDRnew(x) based on
Equation (3). As shown in Figure 2, the pairs of sampled
and deduced values of 0 distribute diagonally, indicating that

Fig. 2. Simulation results on the E.coliand M.tuberculosis datasets. To simu-
late partial annotation, we randomly removed some annotated genes from
the database. Gene sampling was performed on the basis of 6, with a step of
0.1 from 0 to 1, and in addition, 0.95 and 0.99 were also appended. (A) The ex-
perimental FDRnew(X) obtained on the E.colidataset as shown by red crosses
fits well with the theoretical value (blue line). The deduced values for 6 were
approximately identical to the sampled ones, as shown by magenta triangles
on the diagonal line. (B) On the M.tuberculosis dataset, genes were sampled
10 times for each value of 6. The experimental FDRnew(X) values as shown by
red boxes fit well with the theoretical values (blue line) when 6 is less than
0.9. As truly novel peptides may exist, the experimental FDRnew(X) diverges
from the theoretical counterpart. The experimental FDRnew(X) is 0.69 when
sampled 6:1, and the deduced 6 is 0.996 correspondingly. However, all
deduced values for 6 still match the sampled ones (green box), since the an-
notation completeness ratio is very close to 1

the deduced 0 could be used as an estimate of the real annota—
tion completeness ratio.

We also found that if we remove the ‘novel genes’ from the anno—
tated database and search the spectra of novel peptides (identified
by 6—ORF translation search) against the partially annotated data—
base, then these spectra will be assigned with false peptides and ran—
dom scores (see Supplementary Materials S2 and S3 for more
details).

3.2 Results on M.tuberculosis
M.tuberculosis is another organism that has undergone several pro—
teogenomic studies (de Souza et (11., 2008; Kelkar et (11., 2011).

The annotation length ratio of M.tuberculosis is about 0.91,
and its genome is featured by the high GC content. Therefore,
we selected M.tuberculosis as the second organism to verify our
model. A dataset of 503 933 MS/MS spectra was generated

(see Supplementary Method for details of the data) and were
searched against the translated genome (NC_018143.2) under the
same parameter setting as for E.coli. The search resulted in 28 545
target peptides identified, including 682 contaminant ones, 27 528
annotated ones and 335 novel ones. Meanwhile, a total of 230 novel
decoys were obtained above the peptide—level FDR of 1 %, leading to
an experimental FDRnew(x) of 0.69 (:230/335) and a deduced 0 of
0.996, which was calculated through Equation (3). The disparity be—
tween the numbers of novel targets and decoys implies that a set of
truly novel peptides may exist in M.tuberculosis. We performed a
blast search for the 105 (:335 —230) top—scoring novel peptides
and found that 68 of them have been annotated in other mycobac—
terial species, meaning that they are conservative and reliable. The
rest of them should be experimentally validated through further
efforts.

The same simulation experiment of 0 as done on E.coli was also
tested on M. tuberculosis. The deduced values of 0 are in line with
the theoretical ones on differently sampled 6, as shown in Figure 2B.
The experimental FDRnew also fits well with the theoretical coun—
terpart for smaller 0. However, the experimental FDRnew(x) appar—
ently deviates from its theoretical value when 0 Z 0.95, because of
the existence of truly novel peptides. This result shows that
M.tuberculosis is not so completely annotated as E.coli, and FDRnew
(x) is sensitive to the incomplete annotation, even when 0
approaches 1.

In some previous researches, a filter of protein length is applied to
the translated database. To test the inﬂuence of this operation on our
model, we used four length filters of 30, 50, 100 and 500 to modify
the original translated database of M.tuberculosis. The search results
upon these four modified databases show that, a small length fil—
ter (3100) causes minor effect on the theoretical estimation of
FDRnew(x) and the deduced 0 calculated by Equation (3). However,
a large filter such as 500, which removes 80% of annotated genes in
M.tuberculosis, greatly shrinks the sample space of novel peptides
and biases the estimation. In this situation, Equation (3) should be
modified to fit the experimental data consequently (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Therefore, to appropriately use the estimation in Equation
(3), a suitable length filter (e.g. S 100) is necessary.

4 Discussions

Above, we have assumed that the annotated and novel peptides dis—
tribute equally in the expressed and unexpressed proteins. Since not
all proteins are expressed in a specific sample under a specific condi—
tion, estimation of P(IkIT,X > x) becomes harder. In fact, novel
peptides in nearly completely annotated organisms may have lower
expression levels or worse scores, because more abundant and better
scoring peptides are easier to annotate, and accordingly, P(IHEWIT,X
> x) is smaller. This can lead to a larger FDRnew(x) and hence less
credible novel peptide identifications.

The peptide variants resulted from DNA mutation or mRNA al—
ternative splicing are sometimes also considered as novel peptides.
However, these variants are much like protein modifications, the
sample space of which is difficult to estimate explicitly. Definitely,
great care should be taken when reporting these variants, because
the search space of these peptides become even larger, and according
to Fu’s (2012) corollary, more false positives will appear if a global
FDR is used.

In this article, we have revealed that the genome annotation
completeness ratio is the dominant factor inﬂuencing the identifica—
tion accuracy of novel peptides identified by 6—ORF translation
search when a global FDR is used for quality assessment. The

subgroup FDR of novel peptides will be seriously under—estimated if
the genome has been well annotated (e.g. when the annotation com—
pleteness ratio exceeds 90%). For such well—annotated genomes,
separate FDR control is very necessary as recently suggested by
Nesvizhskii (2014).

However, with a stringent FDR control (e.g. 1%), many low
scoring but true peptide identifications may be excluded along with
false positives. To increase the sensitivity and specificity of novel—
gene discovery, one should reduce the size of searched database as
much as possible (Nesvizhskii, 2014). For example, when the tran—
scriptome information (especially from the strand—specific cDNA—
seq data) is available, it is apparently more favorable to search
against the transcriptome as well than to search against the genome
alone. If the transcriptome information is unavailable, it would be
also helpful to reduce the 6—OFR translation database by removing
sequences that are predicted to be hardly possible to be real proteins.
From the point of view of data analysis, we believe that intelligent
post—processing of search results is a promising resolution to sensi—
tive discovery of novel peptides and genes. For example, machine
learning techniques (Kall et (11., 2007) can be used to discriminate
true and false identifications of novel peptides and to re—score and
re—rank the peptides using specific information in proteogenomics.
Alternatively, the search results from multiple search engines can be
combined properly to generate a set of reliable identifications
(Kelkar et (11., 2011).

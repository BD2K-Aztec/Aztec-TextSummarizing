Evidence for the dissemination of cryptic non-coding RNAs

 

single parental gene; more than half of the source sequence was masked
as repetitive elements; the poly(A) tract was not derived from a poly(A)
tail but a microsatellite sequence, such as ‘(AAAAG)n’ (Subramanian
et al., 2003). Finally, 12, 36 and 25 recently retroposed ncRNAs were
identiﬁed in the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively. The source
and target regions were annotated based on the information available at
the UCSC Genome Browser web server.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Identiﬁcation of retroposed ncRNAs in the human,
mouse and rat genomes

To collect strong evidence for retroposition of ncRNAs, I
developed and applied a procedure to identify genomic duplicons
based on distinct signatures of recent retroposition events
(Fig. 1). Genomic duplicons with a poly(A) tail at one end and
ﬂanked by a TSD of 7nt or longer were collected. Then, those
cases for which the source was intronic or intergenic segment
were collected.

I identiﬁed 73 retroposed ncRNAs (12, 36 and 25, respectively)
in the human, mouse and rat genomes (Supplementary Table
S1). Detailed information on the retroposed segments is provided
in Supplementary Dataset S1.

Analysis of sequences around the insertion break points
showed the 5’—TTTT/A—3/ motif (Supplementary Fig. S1),
which is a canonical sequence for the LINE—1 endonuclease
target sites (Cost and Boeke, 1998). This observation suggests
that the retroposition was LINE—1 endonuclease dependent.

The source of the retroposed segments included intronic re—
gions of known genes probably derived from primary transcripts,
promoters or 5/ ﬂanking regions of known genes and intronic or
intergenic regions potentially transcribed as a result of a cryptic
promoter or a nearby repetitive element. A survey of the ex—
pressed sequence tag (EST) and RNA—seq data available at the
UCSC Genome Browser revealed clear evidence for the tran—
scription of the source segments. In eight cases, there were
unspliced ESTs that spanned the source region. And almost all
the human and mouse cases had at least one RNA—seq read that
aligned to the source segment (Supplementary Table S2). Some
retroposed sequences showed strong sequence conservation
across animals, indicating a possible regulatory role.

Twelve cases were identiﬁed in the human genome
(Supplementary Table S1). Nine of these were human—speciﬁc
insertions that occurred in the human genome after the
humanwhimpanzee divergence. The source of the retroposed
ncRNAs was intronic (eight cases) or 5/ ﬂanking regions (one
case) of known genes or intergenic regions (three cases). In seven
cases, the inserted segment was associated with a known gene,
including transcript variants of the RPBJ (ID H004), CCNB3
(ID H011) and TBC1D8B (ID H012) genes.

Thirty—six recently retroposed ncRNAs were identiﬁed in the
mouse genome (Supplementary Table S1). In 13 cases, the source
was sequence associated with a known gene, whereas in the re—
maining 23 cases, the source was intergenic. In 21 cases, the in—
serted segment was present in a known gene; in one case, namely,
the Dab] gene (ID M011), the inserted segment functions as an
internal exon of a variant transcript.

I identified 25 recently retroposed ncRNAs in the rat genome
(Supplementary Table S1). In 14 cases, the source was derived

from a genomic region associated with a known gene. The 15
inserted segments were associated with a known gene. Two of
these segments are part of the 3/ untranslated region (UTR) of
the T rim16 (ID R018) and Wrb (ID R019) genes, respectively.

3.2 Novel exons produced by the retroposed ncRNAs

DNA insertion in a gene could result in exaptation of the in—
serted segment as an exon, resulting in novel transcripts and
protein variants (Kim and Hahn, 2011). Some of the retroposed
ncRNAs identiﬁed in this study now function as novel exons in
the associated gene, resulting in novel transcript variants.

The human T BC 1D8B gene (ID H012) contains a retroposed
ncRNA in intron 11 (Fig. 2). Within the inserted segment, there
is an activated splice acceptor. A cryptic poly(A) site in the
adjacent genomic region, which is preceded by two consecutive
canonical poly(A) signals, was also activated on insertion. This
resulted in generation of the 12th or terminal exon of the
T BC 1D8B transcript variant 2 (NCBI accession number
NM_198881). The source of the retroposed ncRNA was the anti—
sense transcript of EBFI. This retroposition occurred in the
human genome after the humanwhimpanzee divergence; hence,
T BC1D8B transcript variant 2 is human speciﬁc, as described
previously (Kim and Hahn, 2011).

In the case of the mouse Dab] gene (ID M011), ncRNA inser—
tion produced a novel alternative internal exon, the 10th exon
of a Dab] transcript variant (NCBI accession number Y08380)
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The splice acceptor and donor sites of
this exon are within the insert and in the adjacent region, respect—
ively. It was suggested that this transcript variant would produce a
45 kDa isoform of the Dabl protein in mouse cells (Howell et al.,
1997). However, the inserted exon contains a premature termin—
ation codon, which might make this transcript variant susceptible
to nonsense—mediated mRNA decay (Amrani et al., 2006).

The middle of the rat T rim16 gene (ID R018) 3/—UTR contains
a retroposed segment, the entire region of which is transcribed as
part of the 3/ UTR (Supplementary Fig. S3). The retroposed
ncRNA originates from the Btfj‘ gene 5/ ﬂanking region, which
is divergently transcribed from the Btfj‘ gene promoter. The Btfj‘
gene has a CpG island promoter that may have bidirectional
promoter activity, in common with many other CpG island pro—
moters (Yang and Elnitski, 2008). Similarly, the 3/—end of the rat
Wrb gene (ID R019) transcript contains a retroposed segment
originating from an intron of the C7 gene. This insertion ex—
tended the 3/—UTR of the Wrb gene by ~1kb.

3.3 Promoters induced or affected by retroposed ncRNA

Some newly inserted DNA segments can induce de novo tran—
scription of adjacent genomic segments (Kim and Hahn, 2010,
2011). Some of the retroposed ncRNAs identified in this study
induce transcription of associated genes, producing novel tran—
script variants. An example is the human RBPJ gene (ID H004),
where the novel transcript variant starts within the insert (Fig. 3).
Retroposition occurred in intron 1 of the RBPJ gene transcript
variant 4 (NCBI accession NM_203284). An EST (NCBI acces—
sion number DC397179) starts within this retroposed ncRNA,
and the first exon of EST DC397179 is entirely derived from the
insert. The second exon, which contains a start codon, and the
last coding exons are shared with RBPJ transcript variant 4.

Evidence for the dissemination of cryptic non-coding RNAs

 

regions (Kapranov et al, 2007). Another possibility is that these
sequences were derived from eRNAs (Kim et al, 2010; Wang
et al, 2011), although there is no direct evidence that these
regions have enhancer activities.

The steps for retroposition of ncRNAs are likely to be
identical or similar to those of retroposition of retro(pseudo)—
genes and repetitive elements (Fig. 5). First, the transcript is
polyadenylated at an authentic or cryptic poly(A) site. Then,
the polyadenylated RNA molecule is recognized by the enzym—
atic machinery of LINE—1 retrotransposons and inserted into
a new location, generating a TSD during the insertion process.
The inserted segments can serve as novel exons or promoters
to produce novel transcript variants and novel protein isoforms.
If the retroposed ncRNA originates from a regulatory element,
such as an enhancer, it could potentially play a role in genome
regulation.

In summary, I developed a procedure to identify recently
retroposed ncRNAs in the human, mouse and rat genomes
and provided clear evidence for retroposed ncRNAs. I strongly
argue that the dissemination of ncRNAs by retroposition is com—
mon. The inserted segments can create novel transcript variants
of the associated genes and play a role in genome regulation.

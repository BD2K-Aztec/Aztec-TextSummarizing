ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein domains are subunits that can fold and evolve
independently. Identification of domain boundary locations is often
the first step in protein folding and function annotations. Most of the
current methods deduce domain boundaries by sequence-based ana-
lysis, which has low accuracy. There is no efficient method for pre-
dicting discontinuous domains that consist of segments from
separated sequence regions. As template-based methods are most
efficient for protein 3D structure modeling, combining multiple thread-
ing alignment information should increase the accuracy and reliability
of computational domain predictions.

Result: We developed a new protein domain predictor, ThreaDom,
which deduces domain boundary locations based on multiple thread-
ing alignments. The core of the method development is the derivation
of a domain conservation score that combines information from tem-
plate domain structures and terminal and internal alignment gaps.
Tested on 630 non-redundant sequences, without using homologous
templates, ThreaDom generates correct single- and multi-domain
classiﬁcations in 81% of cases, where 78% have the domain linker
assigned within i20 residues. In a second test on 486 proteins with
discontinuous domains, ThreaDom achieves an average precision
84% and recall 65% in domain boundary prediction. Finally,
ThreaDom was examined on 56 targets from CASP8 and had a
domain overlap rate 73, 87 and 85% with the target for Free
Modeling, Hard multiple-domain and discontinuous domain proteins,
respectively, which are significantly higher than most domain pre-
dictors in the CASP8. Similar results were achieved on the targets
from the most recently CASP9 and CASP10 experiments.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein molecules are composed of domains that fold, function
and evolve autonomously. The deﬁnition of protein domains is,
however, not absolute. Recent studies have shown that protein
domains within the same family or superfamily can vary signiﬁ-
cantly in both structure and function (Dessailly et al., 2010;
Reeves et al., 2006). Nevertheless, correct assignment of bound-
aries of the protein domains is essential for the efﬁcient elucida-
tions of protein function and evolutionary mechanisms.

The most accurate characterization of protein domains is
through the analysis of the 3D structures. However, the

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

experimental determination of protein structures is often time
and manpower expensive and some proteins are even impossible
to solve currently. The computational domain prediction from
the amino acid sequence is, therefore, highly demanded. A var-
iety of methods have been recently developed in this regard that
can be roughly categorized into three groups: statistical and ma-
chine-learning based, homology-based and 3D model-based
methods.

The statistical and machine-learning-based methods are prob-
ably the most frequently used approaches to protein domain
predictions, with examples including DGS (W heelan et al.,
2000), DomCut (Suyama and Ohara, 2003), Armadillo (Dumon-
tier et al., 2005), PPRODO (Sim et al., 2005), DOMPro (Cheng
et al., 2006), DomNet 0(00 et al., 2008), DROP (Ebina et al.,
2011), DOBO (Eickholt et al., 2011), PRODOM (Servant et al.,
2002), ADDA (Heger et al., 2005) and EVEREST (Portugaly
et al., 2006). In the DGS, DomCut and Armadillo programs,
the statistical regularities seen in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
structures, including domain size distribution and residue pro-
pensities, are used to deduce the domain linker and boundary
predictions. In PRODOM, ADDA and EVEREST, the domain
boundaries are derived by large-scale sequence comparisons fol-
lowed by clustering analyses. In the rest examples (PPRODO,
DOMPro, DomNet, DROP and DOBO), the residue-based stat-
istical features, together with the position-specific scoring matrix
from PSI-BLAST search, are trained by machine-learning tech-
niques, including neural network, support vector machine and
random forest classiﬁers. These methods deduce boundary infor-
mation from sequence only, which can in principle be applied to
any proteins. But the overall accuracy is low compared with the
homology-based approaches.

In the homology-based methods, e.g. Pfam (Finn et al., 2010),
CHOP (Liu and Rost, 2004) and FIEFDOM (Bondugula et al.,
2009), target sequences are searched through known protein
structure or family libraries by hidden Markov model (HMM)
or PSI-BLAST programs. The domain boundary information is
then obtained by mapping the domain information from the
homologous templates or families following the sequence align-
ments. The homology-based methods can have a high accuracy
of predictions when close templates are identified, but the accur-
acy decreases sharply when the sequence identity of target and
template is low (e. g. <30%).

In the 3D model-based methods, e. g. SnapDRAGON (George
and Heringa, 2002), RosettaDom (Kim et al., 2005) and
OPUS-DOM (Wu et al., 2009), the authors first construct ter-
tiary structure models of the target by either ab initio folding or
knowledge-based coarse-grained modeling simulations. Domain

parser tools are then used to assign the domain information on
the predicted 3D models. The accuracy of domain assignments
relies on the quality of the tertiary models, which usually de-
creases with the size of the target proteins because of the limited
ability of ab initio folding simulations (Zhang, 2008).

Having in mind the improved power of the template-based
protein structure predictions and the increasing size of PDB,
we propose a new algorithm ThreaDom based on multiple
threading algorithms, which aims to signiﬁcantly improve the
reliability of domain predictions in the category of distantly
homologous protein targets. Although the threading-based algo-
rithms have been successfully used in the CASP experiments for
modeling multiple-domain protein structures where the domain
boundaries are usually decided by human-intervened Views and
interpretations of multiple-threading alignment profiles (Zhang,
2007, 2009), this is the ﬁrst time to integrate the multiple thread-
ing algorithms into an automated pipeline for domain boundary
determinations. The key to the algorithm is the development of a
sensitive domain boundary proﬁle that can calibrate composite
structural and sequence alignment information from the multiple
threading templates for precise domain assignment. The method
will be systematically benchmarked on large-scale proteins, to
examine the weaknesses and strengths in comparison with
other widely used domain prediction approaches.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sets

We collect a non-redundant protein set from PISCES (Wang and
Dunbrack, 2003), with the sequence identity cut-off at 25%, resolution
<3.0A and R-factor <1.0. The domain deﬁnitions of these proteins are
taken from CATH 3.4 (Orengo et al., 1997). If the template protein does
not exist in the CATH, the domain structure is deﬁned by DomainParser
(Xu et 01., 2000).

All proteins with a chain length <80 residues or domain length <40
residues are removed, which results in a protein set containing 715 multi-
domain and 2524 single-domain chains. The 715 multi-domain proteins
are divided into training and testing sets, including 400 and 315 chains,
respectively. The 2524 single-domain chains are randomly divided into
two sets, paired with multi-domain proteins in the training and testing
sets.

Based on the signiﬁcance of threading alignments, the protein chains
are categorized into ‘Easy’, ‘Medium’ and ‘Hard’ proteins (see later in the
text). Thus, our training set includes 331 x 2 ‘Easy’, 46 x 2 ‘Medium’ and
23 x2 ‘Hard’ protein sequences, and the testing set contains 261x 2
‘Easy’, 36x2 ‘Medium’ and 18x2 ‘Hard’ non-redundant sequences,
where ‘x2’ refers to two sets of single and multiple-domain proteins.

2.2 Multiple template identiﬁcation by LOMETS

In ThreaDom, LOMETS (Wu and Zhang, 2007) will be used to thread
the target sequences through the PDB for structural template identiﬁca-
tions. LOMETS contains eight threading programs of complementary
approaches, including HHSEARCH (deing, 2005), MUSTER (Wu
and Zhang, 2008), PROSPECT2 (Xu and Xu, 2000), PPA-I (Wu et al.,
2007), SAM-T02 (Karplus et al., 1998), SPARKS2 and SP3 (Zhou and
Zhou, 2005). In HHSEARCH, we implemented two versions of global
and local HMMs, HHSEARCH-1 and HHSEARCH-2. These eight
threading programs are displayed in Figure 1 as the LOMETS-based
threading server layer.

Librarv Layer

 

Fig. 1. Architecture of ThreaDom. It consists of a library layer, a meta-
server threading layer and a domain decision layer from the bottom.
Eight threading programs in the meta-server layer access three structure
libraries in the library layer to provide alignments for the domain decision
layer. Threading Library Map-Adapter calls libraries in the library layer
and provides a uniﬁed order map. In the decision layer, data ﬂow from
A to F

Three independent template libraries are used. First, MUSTER, PPI-l,
SAM-T02 and PROSPECT2 use an internal I-TASSER template library
with sequence identity <70% from http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/
library/; SPARKS2 and SP3 use another internal library of sequence
identity <40%; HHSEARCH uses the library downloaded from ftp://
ftp.tuebingen.mpg.de/pub/protevo/HHsearch/databases, which has also
a 70% sequence identity cut-off. The domain boundaries for all templates
are pre-calculated based on CATH3.4 or DomainParser. As residues in
the template structures were re-ordered in threading libraries, a map-
adapter is established to map all the template libraries into the original
entries in the PDB library so that CATH domain deﬁnitions can be
exploited.

For each LOMETS program, a Z-score cut-off (Z0) is assigned, based
on the threading results data of 1190 independent training proteins, so
that the well-deﬁned alignments with an average TM-score >0.6 can be
achieved when Z-score>Z0. Here, Z—score is a measure of the signiﬁ-
cance of the target-template alignment, deﬁned as the score difference to
the mean in the unit of standard deviation. A protein target is categorized
as ‘Easy’ if each of the LOMETS threading programs have at least one
template with Z-score > Z}; it is a ‘Hard’ target if there is no template hit
with Z-score>Z0 by any programs. Otherwise, it is assigned as a
‘Medium’ target.

2.3 Outline of ThreaDom procedure

Domain predictions in ThreaDom are based on two assumptions: (i)
homologous proteins have similar domain structures; (ii) residues in the
core regions of domain structures are evolutionally more conserved than
that in the boundary (or linker) regions between domains. Following the
assumptions, the ThreaDom procedure contains three steps as displayed
in Figure 1.

(i) Target sequences are threaded through the PDB by eight
LOMETS programs, and a multiple sequence alignment is con-
structed based on the target sequence (with external inserts/ gaps
shaved).

ThreaDom

 

(ii) A domain conservation score (DCS) is calculated for each resi-
due position based on the LOMETS multiple sequence align-
ments, which counts for the balance of conservation and gap
penalty scores.

(iii) Domain boundaries are assigned based on the DCS proﬁle using
a target-speciﬁc scoring cut-off.

2.4 Domain conservation score

In ThreaDom, the domains of the target sequence are speciﬁed by the
location and size of linker regions between two domains (e.g. A and B):

L = {ilstartm < i< end“} (1)

where i is the residue number, starta) is the residue position of the last
residue in domain A along the sequence, end (L) is the position of the ﬁrst
residue in domain B and Start(L)<end(L). In ThreaDom, we consider two
contributions of template domain boundary structure and target-template
alignment gaps, which are used to decide the location and size of the
domain linkers of the target sequences.

2.4.] Template domain linker score ThreaDom considers T tem-
plate alignments obtained by LOMETS, where Tgood is the number of
templates with a Z-scorezzo, and Thad is that with a Z-score<Z0.
Following CATH (or DomainParser) domain deﬁnition, the jth template
has a domain split speciﬁed by the linker structure LjT:

LT(j) = {nsmn‘TL’m — d< i< mm) + d} (2)

where start(TL’(j) and end (TL’U) are the starting and ending positions of the
linkers on jth template. Considering the alignment error that may result
in linker shift, we introduce a distance allowance d to increase the size of
template linkers.

For residue i, the template domain linker score from the T template
alignments is calculated by

Tzaod Thad
ST(i) = 2 W1 x ai,-+ Z w2 x a,-,- (3)
j:1 j:1

where w] and W2 are the weight parameters on ‘good’ or ‘bad’ templates.
a,-,~ counts for whether the ith residue on the target is aligned with the
linker regions of jth template, i.e.

_ m  E 

“'1 ‘l 0 mm") (4)
Here, m counts for the conﬁdence of domain assignment of template
structures. In our benchmark test, there is an agreement between
DomainParser and CATH for ~80% proteins. We set m=0.8 if the
template domain is assigned by DomainParser, and m=1.0 if by
CATH, as the latter is assisted by human intervention and of a higher
accuracy in domain assignment.

2.4.2 Gap penalty score ThreaDom speciﬁes two types of gap penal-
ties from threading alignments: terminal gap Gem, and internal gap G,,,,.
The terminal gaps on jth template are deﬁned by

GtermU)= {ilizv-d<i<jN+dorjc-d<i<jc+d} (5)

where jN and jg are the N- and C-terrninal positions of the ﬁrst and last
aligned residues on jth template. The internal gap is defined by

Gth) = {illm — d< i<jm + d} (6)

where jm = [startg(j) — endGU)] / 2 denotes the middle point of the internal
gaps, and startG(j) and endGO) are the starting and ending locations of the
gaps. To rule out alignment noise, we only consider the gaps with a size
longer than I, i.e. |startg(j) — endGU)| >l.

The total gap penalty score for the residue i is calculated by:

T

s00) = 2 (W3 x b,-,- + W4 x c,) (7)

1:1

where W3 and W4 are the weight parameters; b,,~ and c1,- are the binary
values representing whether the ith residue locates in the gap regions of
the jth template alignment:

_ liEGtemU) _ liEGinU)
b "1' ‘ l 0 i¢ 6mm and 6"!” ‘ l 0 t¢ Gate") (8)

2.4.3 Domain conservation score The template domain linker score
and gap penalty score indicate the degree of variations of multiple thread-
ing alignments at the position i. Accordingly, the domain conservation
score, S(i), is calculated by

S0) = 1 — lTisw) + Saw] (9)

where 1 < i < N, N is the length of the target sequence.

To reduce noise in the DCS assignment that may result in artiﬁcial
domains with very short length, we smooth the domain conservation
score using a 19-residue window:

1 HQ
I - _ _
S(O— ,9 Z) S(k) (10)
kzrig
Meanwhile, S(k) is set to 0 if S(k) <0. Thus, the smoothed domain con-
servation score S’(i) has a value in (0,1).

2.4.4 Deciding domain linkers by DCS profiles A putative domain
linker Lac) in ThreaDom is an aggregation of the continuous residues that
have the conservation score below a certain cut-off Sc, i.e.

L00 = {ilS’(i) < s, and L512, < i< L533} (11)
where k = 1, > > > , n represents the number of linkers. The middle point of

the linker, L33, 2 (4:3,, +  /2, is noted as the predicted boundary to
the linker LU‘) in the ThreaDom program.

As the majority of protein domains in the PDB have a length longer
than 40 residues, we consider two length-based domain ﬁlters. First, if the
distance from LES]; to the terminal of sequence is <40, the Lac) is removed
from the putative linker list (i.e. set L(k)=0). Second, if the distance
between two neighboring linkers is too close, i.e. L265,” — Lﬁm<40, the
linkers will be merged into one linker. The boundary position of the
merged linkers is calculated by

L/(k) = Lilia X A1422:
""1 MES; + MES?)

(k+1) (k+1)
+Lmid X ALmid

(12)

where A453,, 2 SC — S’(LE:,’,,) is associated with the confidence of the
linker assignment on LE2, Based on Equation 12, if the linkers have

similar conﬁdence, i.e. ALifgdw ALEZigl’, the boundary position of

the merged linker is at the middle of the two linkers,
L32, % (LE2, + Lifigl’VZ Otherwise, the boundary of the merged linkers
will be biased to the position of the linker with a higher confidence score.

The ﬁnal continuous domain assignment in the ThreaDom is repre-
sented in the form of (1 — ngdXngd + 1 — L3,) > > (LES?) + 1 — N),
and the residue range in each pair of parenthesis represents an individual
domain. One example of the ThreaDom protein domain prediction is
given in Figure 2, where four individual domains are separated by
three linkers L“), La) and LG), with the cutoff Sc: 0.60.

Equations 1712 have eight free parameters (W1, W2, W3, W4, d, l, Tand
Sc), which will be trained on our training proteins of various classes
(see later in the text).

2.5 Strategy for detecting discontinuous domains

The term discontinuous domain refers to a domain that contains two or
more segments from separated regions of target sequence. ThreaDom
detects discontinuous domains based on the DCS proﬁle and the pre-
deﬁned domain boundaries of the threading templates, which contains
three steps:

Step I: Detecting discontinuous domain sequence. A target is considered
to have discontinuous domains if it has >30% templates that have dis-
continuous domain structure in the LOMETS template collection.

Step II: Clustering the discontinuous domain templates. The discontinu-
ous domain templates are clustered based on their domain boundary
locations and domain assignments. The discontinuous templates are
clustered into one category if they have the same number of domains
with same domain segments number and similar boundaries, where
‘similar boundary’ means that the difference in boundary positions is
within :l:5 residues after structure alignment of the two templates.

Step III: Boundary reﬁnement and discontinuous domain substitution.
After clustering, the DCS-based domain prediction and the domain
structure in the ﬁrst template cluster are combined, i.e. if the domain
boundary difference between the DCS prediction and the ﬁrst template
cluster is within :l:20 residues, the separated domains in the DCS pre-
diction will be merged into a single domain following the assignment in
the first template cluster. Meanwhile, if the number of domains in the
DCS prediction is >3 but less than that in the ﬁrst cluster, we substitute
the DCS prediction with the domain information of the ﬁrst cluster
when the domain boundaries in >50% of templates are consistent
(i.e. differences are :l:20 residues).

2.6 Evaluation criteria

We evaluate the ability of ThreaDom on both the domain number and
the domain boundary predictions. The domain number prediction is as-
sessed by counting the accuracy of single- or multi-domain protein clas-
siﬁcations. We use speciﬁcity, sensitivity and Matthew’s correlation
coefficient (MCC) to assess the domain number prediction:

TP

"f 't = 7 13
Spec1 1c1 y TP + FP ( )
TP
't' 't = — 14
Sen51 1V1 y TP + FN ( )

_ (TPxTN)—(FPxFN)
_ \/(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(FP + TN)(TN + FN)

 

MCC (15)

 

where TP, FP, TN and FN are true positive, false positive, true negative
and false negative rates of the classiﬁcations, respectively.

To assess the quality of domain boundary predictions, we calculate
precision and recall rates, the normalized domain overlap (NDO)-score
(Tai et al., 2005) and the domain boundary distance (DBD) score (Tress
et al., 2007). The precision has a similar deﬁnition to speciﬁcity as deﬁned
in Equation 13, but boundary prediction is designated as ‘TP’ if it is
within :l:20 residues of the true boundary; otherwise it is an ‘FP’ predic-
tion. Recall is similar to the sensitivity in Equation 14, which represents
the fraction of the target boundaries that are correctly retrieved in the
domain predictions. The NDO-score is deﬁned as the normalized overlap
rate of all predicted domain and linker regions with the true assignments
of the target structure. The DBD-score measures the distance of the pre-
dicted boundaries from the true target domain boundaries.

To avoid the contamination of homologous templates that are easy to
predict in ThreaDom, we exclude all the templates that have a sequence
identity >30% to the target protein or that are detectable by PSI-BLAST
with an E-value <0.05. As a control, we implemented ﬁve publicly avail-
able domain predictors, including FIEFDom (Bondugula et al., 2009),
Pfam (Finn et al., 2010), DomPro (Cheng et al., 2006), DROP (Ebina
et al., 2011) and PPRODO (Sim et al., 2005), which represent different
type of homology- and machine-learning-based methods. These methods
are run on the same test set of proteins.

2.7 Parameter training

There are eight free parameters in the ThreaDom scoring Equations
(2711), including four weight parameters (w), W2, W3 and W4), the linker
shift d, the length cut-off of internal gaps l, the number of threading
templates T and the DCS cut-off Sc. We trained the parameters by max-
imizing the precision, recall and NDO scores on the 800 training proteins
(400 single-domain + 400 multi-domain proteins, see Section 2.1). The
parameters are tuned separately for Easy and Medium/Hard proteins. To
increase the efﬁciency, we projected the parameter values on an SD
system and enumerate various values on the lattices. Parameter values
corresponding to the optimal results were selected with results summar-
ized in Table 1. For the 331 x 2 ‘Easy’ targets in our training set, the
optimal NDO, precision and recall scores are 0.919, 0.836 and 0.77, re-
spectively, and those for the 69 x 2 ‘Medium/Hard’ targets are 0.821,
0.476 and 0.32, respectively.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Domain classiﬁcation prediction

A sequence is considered to be a multi-domain protein if it in-
cludes one or more domain linkers. In the test on the 315 x 2
non-homologous proteins that are also non-homologous to the
training protein set, ThreaDom correctly classiﬁes proteins as
being either single- or multi—domain proteins in 81% of the
cases. For the ‘Easy’ protein set, the accuracy is 84.7%, and
for ‘Medium/Hard’ test set, the accuracy is 68.5%.

Table 2 shows a summary of ThreaDom performance in con-
trol with the other ﬁve methods on the single-domain or multi-
domain classiﬁcation. For all the three categories of ‘All’, ‘Easy’
and ‘Medium/Hard’, ThreaDom produces the highest MCC
among the ﬁve predictors. The MCC values are 54, 60 and
41%, respectively, higher than that by the second best predictor
FIEFDom, which is a homologous method-based on PSI-
BLAST search. Pfam, a standard HMM-based domain

assignment program, has a slightly lower average MCC than
FIEFDom.

Interestingly, the two machine-learning—based methods,
DomPro and PPRODO, have top speciﬁcity or sensitive values
in some categories, but they have a low MCC because of unba-
lanced classiﬁcations. For example, in the ‘Easy’ set, PPRODO
has a sensitivity of 100% for multi-domain classiﬁcation but only
1.1% for single-domain, whereas the corresponding speciﬁcity
values were 50.3 and 100%, respectively. These data imply that
PPRODO classiﬁes almost all sequences as multi-domain pro-
tein, which, therefore, leads to a low MCC value of 0.076.
Similarly, DomPro tends to classify most chains as being
single-domain chains that also results in a modest MCC value,
although it has a better balance than PPRODO. In other words,

whereas PPRODO is overpredicting. DROP, another machine-
learning method, has a negative MCC in all three categories of
targets because of the low assignment accuracy.

3.2 Domain boundary prediction

For the proteins in the ‘All’, ‘Easy’ and ‘Medium/Hard’ sets, the
domain boundary predictions by ThreaDom has the NDO-
scores of 0.893, 0.905 and 0.832, DBD-scores of 0.861, 0.887
and 0.737, precisions of 0.784, 0.814 and 0.562 and recalls of
0.670, 0.708 and 0.425, respectively. Figure 3 presents the
ThreaDom prediction results together with that by other five
control methods, where the y-axis is the value of NDO, DBD,
boundary precision and recall scores, and x—axis denotes the
categories of protein sets in ‘All’, ‘Easy’ or ‘Medium/Hard’.
For proteins in all the three categories, ThreaDom achieves the
highest value in NDO-score, DBD-score and boundary preci-
sion. ThreaDom also has the highest score in boundary recall
for ‘All’ and ‘Easy’ categories, and the second highest score in
boundary recall for the ‘Medium/Hard’ proteins.

As shown in Figure 3D, PPRODO has a slightly higher recall
value than ThreaDom for the ‘Medium/Hard’ targets. This is
partly because of the overprediction of PPRODO that predicts
most of the single-domain proteins as multi—domain and has,
therefore, on average more boundary linkers assigned. This
leads to a worse precision value (26.7%) in comparison with
that by ThreaDom (56.2%). Because of the unbalanced recall
and precision, PPRODO has overall a poor performance when
assessed by the NDO— and DBD-scores (Fig. 3A and B).

Different methods have different sensitivities on the category
of protein targets. As shown in Figure 3, the predictions by the

statistical and machine-learning—based methods (DomPro,
DROP and PPRODO) have similar performances in both
‘Easy’ and ‘Medium/Hard’ categories, as these predictions are
from sequence only. The HMM-based method, Pfam, also
does not show difference between Easy and Hard targets because
the domains in Pfam were retrieved from UniProt and ADDA
sequence clustering (Heger and Holm, 2003), which are not dir-
ectly associated with template structures in the PDB library.
However, the two template-based methods, ThreaDom and
FIEFDom, have an obvious difference between ‘Easy’ and
‘Medium/Hard’ proteins because of the different availability of
the template hits in the two category of proteins. Nevertheless,
ThreaDom identiﬁed much more accurate boundary predictions
than FIEFDom in both ‘Easy’ and ‘Medium/Hard’ categories.
Particularly in the ‘Medium/Hard’ protein set, the precision and
recall are three and five times higher than that in FIEFDom.
These improvements are mainly because of (i) the better identi-
ﬁcation of templates by LOMETS than that by PSI-BLAST or
HMM searches and (ii) the sensitive calibration of gaps and
alignments by the domain conservation score as designed by
ThreaDom. These advantages are essential for ThreaDom to
detect efﬁcient domain structures for the weakly- or non-hom-
ologous proteins.

In general, for the ‘Easy’ proteins, there are a large number of
‘good’ templates with a high Z—score as detected by various
threading programs in ThreaDom. The consensus domain as-
signments of the template structures dominate the boundary pre-
dictions. For the ‘Medium/Hard’ targets, however, there are few
consensus ‘good’ templates, and the identiﬁcation of consensus
terminal and internal alignment gaps becomes sensitive. This ex-
plains the reason that the weighting parameters of gap penalty
score (w3 and w4 in Equation 7) become larger for the ‘Medium/
Hard’ targets than that for the ‘Easy’ targets (Table 1). In
Supplementary Table S1 of Supplementary Materials, we sepa-
rated the contributions of template alignment and gap penalty

scores in ThreaDom. Although the gap penalty score tends to
make more important contribution for Hard targets, a combin-
ation of template and gap penalty scores outperforms individual
scores in all categories of targets. Thus, using a balanced con-
sensus of template domain assignment and the internal and ter-
minal gaps from multiple template alignments, the DCS system
helps erase the incident errors from single template alignment by
individual threading programs that are often less reliable.

In Figure 4, we show an illustrative example from the GTP
cyclohydrolase I (PDB ID: lwurA), which is a hard target for
which none of the LOMETS threading program has a strong
template alignment with Z—score>ZO. The chain is classiﬁed as
a two-domain protein with boundary structure of (1755) (5&
185) in the CATH database (Fig. 4E). In the control programs,
both FIEFDom and DROP incorrectly predicted the protein as a
single-domain chain, whereas PPRODO and DomPro correctly
assigned it as a multi-domain protein, but the assigned domain
boundary is 35 and 45 residues away from the CATH assign-
ment, respectively.

As shown in Figure 4D, the alignments among the 50 selected
threading templates are divergent and not conclusive: four tem-
plates at residue 46, two at residues 65, 69 and 102 and others
with domains almost evenly distributed along the sequence.
Similarly in Figure 4B and C, the internal and terminal alignment
gaps are nearly even-distributed. However, when we combine the
contributions from the domain and gap assignments as described
in Equations 9 and 10, the overall DCS proﬁle has an obvious
valley around residue 60 (Fig. 4A), which is due to the weak but
consistent tendency of gap and domain assignments in the mul-
tiple threading alignments. Although there are two other valleys
in the N- and C-terminals, the locations are <40 residues away
from the sequence ends and are ruled out by the default
length filter. Finally, the ThreaDom boundary prediction is
(1760) (617185), which shift by only five residues from the
CATH assignment. This example highlights the power of
ThreaDom in extracting correct domain information from dis-
tantly homologous threading alignments by combining multiple
domain and alignment gap/insertion information.

3.3 Domain prediction assessed by alternative domain
deﬁnitions

One concern of the aforementioned data analyses is on the pos-
sible bias of distinctive domain deﬁnitions of the training and test
proteins, as some methods (e. g. FIEFDom) were trained by do-
mains defined in the SCOP database (Murzin et al., 1995), but
the analyses are mainly on CATH deﬁnitions, which is what
ThreaDom was trained on. In Supplementary Table S2, we pre-
sent a quantitative analysis of the domain predictions on the 315
test protein pairs with the domains defined by SCOP1.75.
Similarly, if a protein cannot be seen in the SCOP library, a
deﬁnition from DomainParser is used instead. Although some
small variations are seen in speciﬁc score values, there is no
qualitative difference between Supplementary Table S2 and the
data shown in Table 1 and Figure 3. These results demonstrate
that the distinctive domain deﬁnitions of different databases
have no impact on the training and testing procedures of
domain predictions.

3.4 Discontinuous domain prediction

Domain assignment for the proteins that have domains consist-
ing of segments from separated locations, called discontinuous
domains, is a long-standing unsolved problem. Despite the sig-
niﬁcant importance of discontinuous domains in protein struc-
tural determination and function annotations, there is so far no
efﬁcient method available for discontinuous domain prediction.

To test the ability of ThreaDom in discontinuous domain pre-
diction, we collect 486 non-homologous multi-domain proteins
from CATH 3.4 that include at least one domain with discon-
tinuous segments. These protein domains/segments have >40
residues with a pairwise sequence identity <40%.

Overall, the automated ThreaDom procedure correctly identi-
ﬁed 88.9% of the proteins as multi-domain proteins. For the
domain boundary prediction, the precision and recall are 83.9
and 64.5%, respectively, which are comparable with that for the
continuous domain protein samples (78.4 and 67.0% in precision
and recall), although we did not separately train ThreaDom on
the discontinuous domain proteins. The success rates of the pre-
dictions demonstrate that the segment assembly procedure has
efﬁciently combined the identiﬁed domain linkers from separated
positions into the discontinuous domains.

To illustrate the procedure, we present in Figure 5 an example
of a discontinuous domain protein from the aminopeptidase I in
Clostridium acetobutylicum (PDB ID: 2gle). The domain struc-
ture in CATH assignment is (1405244455) (103243), where
the ﬁrst domain D1 (1405;244455) contains two segments S 1 1
(17105) and 512 (2444455). The second domain D2 is a continu-
ous domain containing one segment S21 from 105 to 243. In
Figure 5, the domain boundary residues PR0105 and LYS244
are labeled in blue, ARG106 and GLY243 in magenta. P1 and P2
indicate the positions that split the sequence into the two
domains.

As most of the top templates by LOMETS have discontinuous
domain structure, ThreaDom classiﬁed the target as a discon-
tinuous domain protein. Following the multiple template align-
ments, the sequence is split into three segments of s; (17103), s2
(1044243) and s3 (2444455), which are marked in red, green and
yellow, respectively, in Figure 5, where P3 and P2 indicate the

 

Fig. 5. Illustration of ThreaDom on discontinuous domain prediction for
the aminopeptidase I protein (PDB ID: 2gle). The segments assigned by
ThreaDom, s1 (17103), s2 (1044243) and s3 (2444155), are marked in red,
green and yellow, respectively. The separated segments (s1 and s2) are
merged into a single domain following the clusters of the discontinuous
domain templates. P1 and P2 denote the domain boundary position ac-
cording to CATH 3.4, and P2 and P3 are that predicted by ThreaDom

splitting positions of the segments. These segments are highly
consistent with the ﬁrst cluster of discontinuous-domain
templates that have a domain structure of (2771042474154)
(10}246). Therefore, the segments of s; and s3 were merged in
a single domain with s2 assigned as the second domain. As a
result, there is only a two-residue shift in the domain boundary
by the ThreaDom prediction compared with the CATH assign-
ment in this example.

3.5 Benchmark on CASP targets

As publicly available domain predictors are limited, to have a
more extensive benchmark with the state-of—the-art methods, we
test ThreaDom on the protein targets in CASP8 (Ezkurdia et al.,
2009), which is the last community-wide blind experiment on
protein domain prediction (DP). The DP section in CASP8 con-
tains seven multi-domain Free Modeling (FM) targets, 29 Multi-
Domain Hard (MD-Hard) targets and 20 DisContinuous
Domain (DCD) targets. To mimic the CASP procedure, all tem-
plate proteins, which were solved after the CASP8 experiment,
were excluded from the LOMETS threading library when imple-
menting ThreaDom.

In Figure 6, we present the average NDO-score of ThreaDom
predictions in the three categories, in control with the seven
severs in the CASP8 DP section, which submitted predictions
for all the targets (ﬁve other servers, which submitted only partial
targets, were not shown in the ﬁgure). Overall, ThreaDom has an
average NDO-score of 0.738, 0.868 and 0.854 for the FM, MD-
Hard and DCD targets, respectively. For the entire set of 56
targets, the average NDO-score is 0.847, which is higher than
all the predictors in the CASP8 experiment.

In Figure 7, we present three typical examples of ThreaDom
predictions for the CASP8 targets. First, T0496 and T0397 in
Figure 7A and B have the domain boundary deﬁned as (#123)
(1244178) and (1782) (837150), respectively, based on the experi-
mental structures. Both targets are FM targets that have no ob-
vious template hit by LOMETS. ThreaDom combined the

Fig. 7. Illustrative examples of domain prediction by ThreaDom on
CASP8 targets: (A) FM target T0496; (B) FM target T0397; (C) DCD
target T0490. The domain boundary from the native structures is labeled
by the cutting pars P17P6 with the adjacent residues marked in blue and
magenta. The domain segments predicted by ThreaDom are marked in
different colors. In T0490, the neighboring segments are correctly merged
into two individual domains

consensus of template alignments and gap penalty scores, which
generated a domain prediction as (17113) (1144178) and (1775)
(7&150) for the two targets; these correspond to NDO-scores of
0.889 and 0.907, respectively. All the predicted boundaries are
within :I:10 residues from the native domain deﬁnition.

T0490 in Figure 7C is also an FM target but with DCD struc-
ture, (5787|1437227|3197368) (887142l2287318). The ﬁrst step of
the DCS scan split the target sequence into five segments, i.e. (17
84) (8&142) (1437223) (2244319) (32(%369), shown in red, green,
orange, cyan and yellow, respectively. After the template domain
structure clustering and boundary reﬁnement, the ﬁrst, third and
ﬁfth segments are merged into the ﬁrst domain and the rest into
the second domain. The final prediction (1785|1437225|3197368)
(8&142l22&318) has a DNO-score of 0.97, which is close to the
native structure not only in the domain number and boundary
but also in the DCD components (Fig. 7C).

Domain prediction tests were not included in the most recent
CASP experiments (CASP9 and 10). The FM/Hard targets in the
experiments, however, represent a set of well-deﬁned real-time
proteins free of homologous contaminations. In Supplementary
Table S3, we list the performance of ThreaDom, in control with
FIEFDom, Pfam, DROP, Dompro and PPRODO, on 46
FM/MD-Hard targets with 22 from CASP9 and 24 from
CASP10. Similarly, all protein templates solved after the CASP
experiments were excluded. To examine the impact of different
steps of procedures, we implemented two version of ThreaDom,
i.e. ThreaDoml used the Domain Conservation score without
linker reﬁnement and DCD detection procedures, whereas
ThreaDom2 is a complete ThreaDom implementation, including
both procedures.

As shown in Supplementary Table S3, ThreaDom2 obviously
outperforms ThreaDoml in all criteria of precision, recall, DNO-
and DBD-scores, which demonstrates the importance of the re-
finement procedures. Overall, the two ThreaDom programs are
ranked as the top two methods in most of the assessments for the
CASP9 and CASP10 targets, except for that the DBD-score, and
the boundary recall of the ThreaDom programs are slightly
lower than that of a few other methods for the CASP9 targets.

3.6 Drawbacks of ThreaDom

ThreaDom is a threading-based method, and the quality of the
threading template alignments has a major impact on the per-
formance of the domain predictions. Generally, the success rate
for Easy targets with a strong hit is higher than that of Hard/
Medium targets. However, there are also cases that strong tem-
plates hits can result in incorrect domain assignments. The major
sources of errors in ThreaDom come from (i) inconsistent
domain order of homologous proteins; (ii) non-specific DCS
cut-offs; and (iii) unmatched sequence size between target and
templates.

Supplementary Figure S1 shows two examples of the incorrect
ThreaDom predictions because of inconsistent domain orders,
one from the Talin—l (PDBID: 3dyjA) and one from the DNA
polymerase III subunit )3 (PDBID: 3d1gA). Target 3dyjA is a
two-domain protein with boundary at 164 according to CATH
(Supplementary Fig. SlA). LOMETS identiﬁed the top template
from 2 x OcA, which has the same architecture to the target but
with domains containing swapped segments (Szilagyi et al., 2012)
(Supplementary Fig. SlB); this results in an incorrect split (1798)
(997162) (1637241) (2427311) by ThreaDom (Supplementary
Fig. SlC). ThreaDom did not merge the separate segments, as
the fraction of hits on 2 x 00A is below the cut-off (30%) in this
example. Target 3d1gA consists of three domains: (17123) (124
247) (2487366) in CATH (Supplementary Fig. SlD). It has the
dominant template alignments from 2awaB with a high TM-
score to the target (Supplementary Fig. SlE). However, 2awaB
contains discontinuous domain structures (17138|20&244) (139i
204|24$375) in CATH, which results in an incorrect domain
assignment (17123|19&241) (1244194l2427366) following
threading mapping (Supplementary Fig. SlF), despite the fact
that the overall topology of the two proteins is close.

The domain linker regions in ThreaDom are decided by the
interplay of DCS profile and threshold cut-offs. To increase the
speciﬁcity, the DCS cutoff parameter has been trained in two sets

ThreaDom

 

of Easy and Medium/Hard proteins. Nevertheless, a single cut-
off score might be still too general, which can result in over- or
underprediction of protein domains. Figure 8A is an example of
overprediction on 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase I (PDBID:
2oﬁcA), which is a single-domain protein target. LOMETS con-
siders it as a Hard target, as no signiﬁcant template was identi-
ﬁed. Among the top 35 template hits, 19 are multiple-domain
proteins and 10 have the terminal gap near the residue 120. The
DCS proﬁle has, therefore, an artiﬁcial valley lower than the
DCS threshold 0.76 for Hard/Medium target, which results in
an overprediction of (17120) (1217182) for this target. If the DCS
threshold for Easy target (0.6) was taken, this artiﬁcial valley
could have been ignored.

Figure 8B is an example of underprediction because of the
inappropriate DCS cut-offs. This protein is from the y subunit
of the dissimilatory sulﬁte reductase (DsrC) (PDBID: lsauA),
which is a two-domain Hard protein with domain assignment
as (1414) (4&114) in CATH. Although the DCS proﬁle has a
well-shaped valley at the correct domain boundary region,
ThreaDom mis-predicted it as a single-domain protein because
the N-terminal peak of DCS-score is lower than the threshold
cut-off 0.76, and the N-terminal domain boundary is, therefore,
overseen by ThreaDom. Again, if the DCS threshold for Easy
target (0.6) was taken, this valley could have been picked up. The
major reason for the low DCS peak is that the domain segment is
short, and nearly all the residues undergo a gap penalty because
they are too close to the two terminal and internal gaps. As
shown in Equations (2, 5 and 6), a distance allowance d (210/
12) was introduced to tolerate the alignment/ gap uncertainty; but
it also introduces overpenalty for small domains. Generally,
ThreaDom is unable to predict small domains with size <20
residues. To enhance the sensitivity for small domains, a size-
dependent threshold cut-off might be needed for ThreaDom.

As ThreaDom derives domain information from templates,
insufﬁcient coverage of template alignments is another source
of errors in ThreaDom prediction. This is particularly a problem
for big proteins, such as the armadillo and heat repeats and

ﬂ-propellers etc, when the solved template proteins cover only

ample of such big proteins from the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase catalytic subunit (PDBID: 1e8yA), which contains 841
residues with five domains assigned in CATH: (17166) (1687302)
(303488) (4897646) (6477841). There are overall 31 strong tem-
plate hits in LOMETS but most of them have a length <550
residues as seen in Figure 8D. As a result, ThreaDom generates
a prediction of three domains (17165) (16&303) (3044841) with
only the ﬁrst two domains correctly assigned. We did notice that
there are weak valleys in the third and fourth domain boundary
linkers that are from the alignment shifts in the C-terminal re-
gion, but they are too weak to pick-up by the current DCS cut-
offs (0.6 for Easy proteins). This example highlights on one hand
the importance of ﬁne-tuning DCS threshold parameters. On the
other hand, the domain prediction for big proteins may be fur-
ther improved by an iterative threading procedure, i.e. repeating
threading on the large single-domain sequences. In this example,
if we run LOMETS on the remaining big domain (3044841) re-
cursively, correct domain assignment can be obtained for the
third, fourth and fifth domains.

4 CONCLUSION

We developed a multiple-threading-based method, ThreaDom,
for protein domain boundary prediction. For a given target, it
ﬁrst threads the sequence through the PDB library to identify
homologous and analogous templates. The profile distribution of
the DCS, which combines the composite information of template
domain structure and terminal/internal alignment gaps, is then
derived for identifying the domain boundary locations. If DCDs
are detected in the threading alignments, segments from sepa-
rated sequences will be merged into single domains under the
guide of the top template domain clusters and the target-template
alignments.

There are several distinct advantages of ThreaDom over the
current domain methods in literature. First, for the proteins of
homologous templates, the domain assignment from threading
alignments achieves a signiﬁcantly higher accuracy than that
from ab initio statistical or machine-learning approaches
(Fig. 3). For proteins without close homologies, the LOMETS
threading programs often identify multiple alignments or
super-secondary structure segments from weakly homologous
templates, where the DCS proﬁle can help pull out consensus
information between domain structure and alignment gaps. This
enables ThreaDom to generate useful domain information for
the targets that traditional homology-based approaches have dif-
ﬁculty with. It has also the advantage over the structural mod-
eling-based approaches, as no lengthy modeling simulations are
needed, and the approach has basically no limit on the size of
protein targets.

ThreaDom was tested on three independent sets of proteins.
For the ﬁrst set of 315 single- and multi-domain protein pairs,
ThreaDom achieves MCCs of 0.734 and 0.432 in single-/multi-
domain classiﬁcation compared with the CATH deﬁnition for
‘Easy’ and ‘Medium/Hard’ targets, respectively, which are sig-
niﬁcantly higher than the control methods from homology and
machine-learning-based approaches. Similar results are obtained
when using an alternative domain definition from SCOP, which

demonstrates the reliability of the data analysis. Second, in the
test of 486 DCD proteins, ThreaDom has a similar domain as-
signment accuracy as that in continuous domains with a preci-
sion and recall 83.9 and 64.5%, respectively, in the domain
boundary prediction. Finally, when tested on the 56 CASP8 tar-
gets, ThreaDom has NDO-scores 0.761, 0.868 and 0.854 for the
FM, MD-Hard and DCD targets, respectively. The average
NDO-score for all targets is 0.847 that is the highest among all
CASP8 servers from different categories of homology, machine-
learning and ab initio folding-based approaches. Similar achieve-
ments are obtained for targets in the CASP9 and CASP10
experiments.

Overall, these data demonstrate a new promising approach
that fills up the gaps between the sequence-based and the hom-
ology-based methods, which can achieve reliable domain assign-
ments in all categories of template-based and template-free
modeling protein targets. Nevertheless, ﬁne-tuning on DCS pro-
ﬁle cut-offs and iterative threading are needed for further im-
provement on small domain recognition and long sequence
covering, respectively.

Although ThreaDom uses template-based modeling approach,
it is much faster than the normal protein folding simulations, as
the threading procedure involves only the sequence alignment
search through a subset of the PDB library, which takes
~20 min for one target protein. This speed makes it fairly feasible
to genome-wide applications, as a single threading scan for a
middle-size genome of 5000 genes takes <1 day on a 100-00re
cluster and that using multiple threading programs, such as
LOMETS, should take <1 week. An online server, as well as
the source code package of ThreaDom, is freely available for
academic users at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/
ThreaDom/.

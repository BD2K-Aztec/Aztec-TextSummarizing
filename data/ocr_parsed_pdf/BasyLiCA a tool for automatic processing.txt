ABSTRACT

Summary: Live Cell Array (LCA) technology allows the acquisition of
high-resolution time-course profiles of bacterial gene expression by
the systematic assessment of fluorescence in living cells carrying
either transcriptional or translational fluorescent protein fusion.
However, the direct estimation of promoter activities by time-
dependent derivation of the fluorescence datasets generates high
levels of noise. Here, we present BasyLiCA, a user-friendly open-
source interface and database dedicated to the automatic storage
and standardized treatment of LCA data. Data quality reports are
generated automatically. Growth rates and promoter activities are cal-
culated by tunable discrete Kalman filters that can be set to incorpor-
ate data from biological replicates, significantly reducing the impact of
noise measurement in activity estimations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite recent developments in transcriptomic technologies, direct
RNA sequencing and tiling array approaches require tedious
sample preparations. For this reason, they are not suitable for
transcriptional high-resolution time courses that require one
microarray and/or messenger RNA (mRNA) extraction per time-
point. An alternative approach is to measure the transcriptional
activity of promoters using reporter genes. In the last decade,
ﬂuorescent proteins, in particular Green Fluorescent Protein
(GFP), have become widely used (Giepmans et al., 2006). Major
advances have come from the characterization and development
of fast-folding GFP monomer variants (Grifﬁn et al., 1998).
Fluorescent reporters allow the high-temporal-resolution meas-
urement of promoter activity in living cells (Ronen et al., 2002).
Live Cell Array (LCA) technology involves the generation of a
large collection of strains that harbour transcriptional fusions with
fast-folding ﬂuorescent proteins and monitoring their

accumulation under the appropriate conditions. The promoter
activity proﬁles of up to 96 individual ‘gfp’ fusions in cells
grown in microtiter plates can be obtained at once at very high
resolution by determining the difference in ﬂuorescence levels at
successive timepoints. Promoter activation or deactivation can be
easily detected by an increase or a decrease in the ﬂuorescence
accumulation rate. This high-throughput technology was proven
to be an accurate and versatile method of determining gene ex-
pression in 2000 Escherichia coli promoters subjected to a glucose
lactose diauxic shift experiment (Zaslaver et al., 2006).

We previously described the development of the plasmid
pBaSysBioII, constructed within the framework of the
EU—funded BaSysBio systems biology program (http://www.
basysbio.eu/), for use in the LCA analysis of gene expression
in Bacillus subtilis (Botella et al., 2010). However, no tools
have been developed to facilitate the analysis of the quickly
growing bacterial LCA datasets. Here, we report the develop-
ment of a user-friendly software, BasyLiCA, for the storage
and analysis of LCA data. BasyLiCA is dedicated to wet lab
biologists for the analysis of large amounts of LCA data in
microplates. As a proof of concept, we produced and analysed
LCA data for several promoters using B. subtilis as a model
bacterium and the newly developed pBaSysBioII plasmid (see
Supplementary Information).

2 BASYLICA DESCRIPTION

BasyLiCA is an open-source software for the automatic and sys-
tematic management and treatment of LCA datasets. The soft-
ware is compatible with Windows XP, Vista and 7 and published
under the GNU licence. BasyLiCA is composed of a database, a
web interface and a data analysis module, which is dedicated to
the estimation of promoter activities and developed in the stand-
ard open-source R language (see Supplementary Fig. S2 and
Supplementary Information for details).

2.1 Database

The BasyLiCA database was developed in MySQL and is com-
posed of seven tables (see Supplementary Fig. S3) describing all of
the parameters of LCA experiments: plate and strain characteris-
tics, well composition, injection information, measured and treated
data. The privacy of data and of strain characteristics can be easily
managed through a dedicated administrator module to allow
access to the owner, the owner and colleagues or the entire world.

2.2 Interface

The web interface is implemented in php/html and can be used
either locally or in web server mode through the Wampserver
provided with BasyLiCA. The user-friendly interface allows
(i) the automatic insertion of LCA measurements; (ii) the
manual or semi-automatic insertion of the characteristics of
wells, strains and injection; (iii) the administration and the man-
agement of the database as a simple user or as an administrator
and (iv) data treatment.

2.3 Data treatment

LCA data are pre-treated to evaluate the data quality. A report is
automatically generated to help the user select the relevant wells
for the estimation of the promoter activity. The data associated
to the selected wells are then treated by well-established algo-
rithms for ﬁltering in industrial engineering, named discrete
Kalman ﬁlters. Essentially, the discrete Kalman filter uses a
series of measurements observed over time, containing noise
and uncertainties, to produce estimates of unknown variables
(promoter activities in the case of BasyLiCA). Theoretically,
such estimations (using biological replicates) tend to be more
precise than those solely based on a single measurement.
Moreover, the data dynamics are free of ‘a priori’ fitting func-
tions (e.g. polynom, logistic, etc.). The discrete Kalman ﬁlter
only requires the definition of a dynamical model describing
the theoretical behaviour over time of LCA data:

OD(k + 1) = (1 + u(k)8i)OD(k) + bo(k)
I F1uo(k + 1) = Fluo(k) + a(k)OD(k)6, + bfac).

where 8, is the sampling time, u(k) and a(k) correspond to the
growth rate and the promoter activity at time k, respectively and
b0(k) and bf(k) are the noise in the optical density (OD) and
ﬂuorescence (Fluo) measurements, respectively. All variables of
the model are time-dependent. In BasyLiCA, two types of dis-
crete Kalman ﬁlters are implemented, including (Type I) or omit-
ting (Type II) data from biological replicates and are based on
the robust numerical algorithm of Verhaegen and Van Dooren
(1986). Type II discrete Kalman ﬁlter is applied to each well and
estimates OD, ﬂuorescence, growth rate and promoter activity.
For Type I ﬁlter, the OD and growth rate are ﬁrst estimated for
each well of the plate. Then, the ﬂuorescence and the promoter
activity are estimated by assuming a common promoter activity
for all replicates. The Kalman filters can be adjusted by only two
parameters representing the data quality level and the smoothing
degree. These parameters are easily tunable by sliders in
BasyLiCA. The results are stored in the database and in CSV
and PDF files. Bacteria can also have a low level of auto-
ﬂuorescence, in which case additional post-treatment is required
when computing the promoter activities (see Supplementary
Information).

3 APPLICATION

Promoter activities can be directly computed by raw differenti-
ation of the ﬂuorescence curve over time divided by the OD
curve. However, the promoter activities obtained in this way are
highly noisy (Fig. 1). In contrast, the discrete Kalman ﬁlter allows
the user to set a trade-off between the estimation of the dynamics

of the promoter activity and the level of noise ﬁltering (coloured
curves). Furthermore, both the dynamics of the ﬁlter and the level
of the noise ﬁltering are improved if replicates are included in the
discrete Kalman ﬁlter compared with Type II (without replicates)
Kalman ﬁlter. In Signal Processing, the decrease of the sampling
time theoretically improves the estimations of promoter activity
dynamics. However, lowering the sampling time to 1min had not
the expected impact. Actually, technical noise increased, which
requires high level of noise ﬁltering (see Supplementary
Information). Consequently, a sampling time of 5 or 10min
should be more suitable for the current LCA technology.

In conclusion, BasyLiCA is a convenient and user-friendly
piece of software dedicated to high-throughout LCA growing
datasets in Systems Biology. It will help wet lab biologists as
well as modellers to capture the dynamics of promoter activity
time courses.

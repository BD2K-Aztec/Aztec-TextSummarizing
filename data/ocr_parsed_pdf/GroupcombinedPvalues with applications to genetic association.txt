Abstract

Motivation: In large—scale genetic association studies with tens of hundreds of single nucleotide poly—
morphisms (SNPs) genotyped, the traditional statistical framework of logistic regression using max—
imum likelihood estimator (MLE) t0 inferthe odds ratios OfSNPs may not work appropriately. This is be—
cause a large number of odds ratios need to be estimated, and the MLEs may be not stable when some
of the SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium. Under this situation, the P—value combination proced—
ures seem to provide good alternatives as they are constructed on the basis of single—marker analysis.
Results: The commonly used P—value combination methods (such as the Fisher’s combined test, the
truncated product method, the truncated tail strength and the adaptive rank truncated product) may
lose power when the significance level varies across SNPs. T0 tacklethis problem, a group combined P—
value method (GCP) is proposed, where the P—values are divided into multiple groups and then are com—
bined at the group level. With this strategy, the significance values are integrated at different levels, and
the power is improved. Simulation shows that the GCP can effectively control the type I error rates and
have additional power overthe existing methods—the power increase can be as high as over 50% under
some situations. The proposed GCP method is applied to data from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16.
Among all the methods, onlythe GCP and ARTP can give the significance to identify a genomic region
covering gene DSC3 being associated with rheumatoid arthritis, butthe GCP provides smaller P—value.

appropriately. This is because it employs the likelihood function and
uses the maximum likelihood approach to estimate the odds ratios,
and a high—dimensional problem needs to be optimized. The global
solution is difficult to find, and also in some cases when the SNPs
are in high linkage disequilibrium (LD), the Hessian matrix derived
from the likelihood function may be singular and thus the solution is
not stable. A useful alternative strategy is to analyze the SNPs one
by one and then combine the P—values together.

For combining the P—values, one popular choice is the Fisher’s
method (Fisher, 1932), also referred to as the Fisher’s combined test
(FCT). If the m P—values to be combined are independent, the FCT
statistic follows the Chi—squared distribution with 2m degrees of
freedom. If these m P—values are correlated, the re—sample methods
are recommended to obtain the empirical distribution of the FCT.
Otherwise the type I error rates may be inflated (Zaykin et al.,
2002). The PCT has been widely applied in genetic association stud—
ies (Hess and Iyer, 2007; Li et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2012).
However, it may lose power when the degrees of freedom are large
and most of the SNPs are not significant. To tackle this problem,
combining the truncated P—values have been recommended.
Dudbridge and Koeleman (2003) proposed to combine the k small—
est P—values as the test statistic. However the power of this approach
is very sensitive to the value of k—an inappropriate k results in
combing some non—significant P—values and power loss, especially
when m is large (Dudbridge and Koeleman, 2003). Yu et a1. (2009)
suggested using multiple candidate truncation points and proposed
an adaptive rank truncated product method (ARTP). This method
can efficiently and flexibly accumulate association evidence across
SNPs and remove the subjectivity of choosing k to some extent.
Instead of combining the k smallest P—values, Zaykin proposed a
truncated product method (TPM) by using the product of only those
P—values smaller than a specified threshold (Zaykin et al., 2002). By
choosing a proper cut—point such as 0.05, the TPM increases power.
Recently, Jiang proposed a truncated tail strength statistic (TTS)
(Jiang et al., 2011), which was proved to have higher power than
the tail strength method (Taylor and Tibshirani, 2006) and the FCT
under certain scenarios. Chen proposed a sequential test (Chen
et al., 2013), which was shown to have almost the same power with
the ARTP.

Taking a closer look at the truncated combined P—value proced—
ures, we found that the P—values are divided into two groups and
that the group with smaller P—values is used to construct the test
statistics. To develop a more powerful test for identifying genetic as—
sociation, our proposal is to divide the P—values into three or more
groups. In each group, a test statistic is constructed. The test statis—
tics are then combined to form an omnibus test. The proposed
grouping strategy has sound basis. Biologically, SNPs in a certain
genomic region can be divided into multiple blocks, with high LD
within blocks and low LD between blocks. In one block, if there is a
SNP associated with a disease, then it is likely that all SNPs in this
block are associated with the disease because of LD. Statistically,
such SNPs form the groups of interest.

In fact, any P—value combination procedures can be seen as differ—
ent combinations using functions. The PCT uses f(p1. p2. . . . . pm) :
11:11)), and the TPM employs g(p1,p2, . . . ,pm) :  pig” ST). The
ARTP can also be regarded as h(p1.p2.....pm) : min15;5]§(ky),
where ﬂky) is the estimated P—value for the statistic III-11pm and
k;,/ : 1. . . . .1 are a set of prespecified candidates. Since there does
not exist the uniformly optimal function of combining P—values. As an
extension of the TPM with setting ] : 1 in our method, Where the
number of group is one, we use two functions log and the cumulative

distribution function of two degrees of freedom to combine the
P—values. When the P—values are independent and each P—value has
the significance, the PCT is more powerful than the GCP, and if these
P—values are correlated and few P—values show significances, the GCP
is more powerful than the FCT. Extensive computer simulations show
that the proposed test is more powerful than the existing combined
tests while maintaining a good control of type I error rates. In the ana—
lysis of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 data, the proposed method
can successfully detect the association between a genomic region cov—
ering gene DSC3 and rheumatoid arthritis, which might be missed by
some other existing P—values combination methods.

2 Methods

Suppose that there are m P—values in a genetic association study, and
these P—values are obtained from testing the associations between
the m SNPs and phenotype. The existing methods such as the TPM
and TTS divide them into two groups and combine the P—values
in the group with smaller values. A natural extension is to divide the
P—values into more than two groups and combine the P—values at the
group level and form group—level test statistics.

Let 0 < £1 < £2 < -- - < £1 < 1 be the ] thresholds. Then the
group—combined P—value test statistic (for short, GCP) is constructed
as follows

where £0 : 0, and F/‘(') is the cumulative distribution function of
21:1—21npiI{5/il<pé§/}for/: 1, 2, ' ' ' ,1.

Statistical properties of the GCP are established in the
Supplemental Material. The GCP builds on single—marker analysis,
which analyze one SNP from a panel of SNPs each time and combine
them together. To calculate P—value of the GCP, we use the bootstrap
procedure, where the correlations among SNPs in each replicate are
kept. So it considers the correlations among SNPs and can be regarded
as an alternative way to do multi—marker analysis. On the other hand,
we can use the standard multi—marker analysis procedures such as
LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) or graphical LASSO (Friedman et al.,
2008) to select SNPs in a logistic regression model. To obtain the P—
value of the GCP, one needs to conduct a multiple integration using
the asymptotical distribution. Alternatively, we propose using the fol—
lowing algorithm to estimate the empirical P—value.

3 Results

3.1 Simulation settings

We conducted simulation studies to examine the performance of
proposed GCP and to compare with the existing FCT, TPM, TTS
and ARTP procedures. For the TPM, we chose 0.05 as the cut point.
For the ARTP, the candidate points {10, 20, 30, 40,50,
60,70,80,90,100}, as recommended by Chen (Chen et al., 2013),
were used. We considered m :200 and 500. The null hypothesis is
that these m SNPs are not associated with the disease, and the alter—
native hypothesis is that at least one SNP is associated with the dis—
ease. Among these m SNPs, at most L are allowed to be associated
with the phenotype, and L (2 "11—7) is set following Mukherjee
(Mukherjee et al., 2015), where y is used to determine whether the
signals are dense or sparse (y S % corresponds to a dense region and
y 2 % corresponds to a sparse region). Here we set V : 0.4. To re—
duce computational cost, we generated m correlated P—values, cor—
responding to the significance levels of m SNPs, using the Gaussian—
copula or t—copula directly, and the structure of the variance—
covariance matrix is A : (pk—(UMXM for 0 g p g 1. Under the null
hypothesis, to generate P—values from a m—dimensional Gaussian—
copula (Embrechts et al., 2003), we first generated
X E (X1,X2, - - - ,me (where 1: denotes the transpose of a vector or
a matrix) from a m—dimensional normal distribution with mean 0m

by transforming each component in X by its marginal distribution.
That is, (p1,p2,...,pm):(@(Xl),<I>(X2),...,<I>(Xm)), where  de—
notes the standard normal distribution function. For the t—copula, a
similar procedure was implemented. Under the alternative hypoth—
esis, we first generated the P—values following the above strategy and
then transferred them to the p, quantile of a Beta distribution with
parameters 0.3 and 30. The probability density function of this dis—
tribution is shown in Figure 1. The transferred quantiles were then
taken as the observations. We considered three values of ,0, including
0.2, 0.5 and 0.8. L takes value from {0,1,2,---,42}, where L:0 cor—
responds to the null hypothesis. L242 is the maximum value for
7112500 considering y: 0.4 and the maximum L224 for m:200 is
also in this set. The empirical power is calculated based on 10 000
replicates. The nominal significance level (or) is set as 0.05.

3.2 Empirical type I error rates and power

3.2.1 Group number and threshold

It is a key to choose ] and é, / : 1, 2, - - - ,1. An appropriate thresh—
old is needed to obtain a powerful test. To assist choosing the proper
threshold, we conducted simulations with several candidates and
provided the results in Tables 1 and 2. The optimal selection of the
groups and the thresholds depends on the P—values structure and
therefore the structure of the data. In Table 1, it can be seen that in
the majority of the considered scenarios, the GCP with j: 2 and £1
: 0.001, £2 : 0.05 perform better when p : 050.8 for m :200,
but it with [:3 and £1 : 0.001, £2 : 0.01 and £3 : 0.05 works
better when p : 0.2 and the number of markers associated with the
diseases is more than 3. So the choices of]: 2 and ] : 3 are both ap—
propriate for a low linkage disequilibrium scenario. To reduce the
computational complexity, we recommend ] :2. Synthesizing all
the results in Tables 1 and 2, it can be seen that the performance for
j: 2 is better than I: 3 in majority of the scenarios. As the uncer—
tainty of the number of markers associated with the diseases in the
real applications, from the standpoint of robustness, we also recom—
mend the choice of] : 2. Next we use the idea of the degrees of free—
dom (DF) to explain why we chose ]:2. It is known that when a

3.2.2 Methods comparison
The empirical type I error rates are shown in Table 3. It can be seen
that all of the methods considered can control the type I error rates

properly. The empirical values are very close to the nominal level of
0.05. For example, when p : 0.2, m :200 and the data are gener—
ated from the Gaussian—copula, the empirical type I error rates of
the FCT, TPM, TTS, ARTP and GCP are 0.048, 0.056, 0.051,
0.045 and 0.051, respectively. When ,0 : 0.8, m :500 and the data
are generated using the t—copula, the values of power of the FCT,
TPM, TTS, ARTP and GCP are, respectively, 0.049, 0.049, 0.050,
0.046 and 0.051.

Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the empirical power of the FCT, TPM,
TTS, ARTP and GCP for p : 0.2, p : 0.5 and p : 0.8, respectively.
It can be easily seen that the GCP is much more powerful than the
alternatives under most of the simulated scenarios. Sometimes, the
improvement can be 50% or more. For example, when p : 0.2,
m :200, L : 3, and the data are generated using the t—copula, the
values of power of the FCT, TPM, TTS, ARTP and GCP are 0.069,
0.064, 0.056, 0.159 and 0.736, respectively. The improvement of
the GCP over the alternatives is smaller under the Gaussian—copula

GCP integrates the information significance at different levels and
improves power.

The proposed GCP can have applications far beyond this article.
As the first example, we consider the analysis of different complex
human diseases, which can be ‘correlated’. Simultaneously analyzing
genetic variants associated with multiple correlated diseases or traits
can help investigators understand the genetic architecture of diseases
and improve the power to identify deleterious genetic variants
(Aschard et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Solovieff et al., 2013). In such
analysis, quite often more than 100 phenotypes and a genetic variant
are studied at a time (Aschard et al., 2014). The proposed GCP can
be directly applied to this example. In addition, the proposed GCP
can also be used to detect the associations between multiple genetic
variants and multiple phenotypes. One can first use a multistep com—
bined principal component method (Aschard et al., 2014) or multi—
variate linear mixed model (Zhou and Stephens, 2014) to obtain the
P—value for the association between each variant and multiple
phenotypes and then employ the GCP to combine them.

To obtain the P—value under the GCP, potentially, a two—layer
resampling procedure needs to be conducted. First, an inner layer of
bootstrap or permutation procedure is required to obtain the distri—
bution of test statistic at the group level. Then a second layer of
bootstrap or permutation procedure is needed to obtain the distribu—
tion of the GCP. This can be computational intensive, especially,
when the nominal significance level is small. One needs to conduct
millions of bootstrap or permutation steps to obtain a valid P—value.
To overcome this obstacle, we proposed a one—layer permutation
procedure to obtain the P—value.

In this work, the simulations and data analysis have been focused
on binary traits. It is noted that the GCP is flexible and can be
applied to other types of phenotypes in large—scale genetic studies. If
the trait is quantitative, we can first use the linear regression model
to obtain the P—value for each SNP when the normal assumption
holds, and then combine them together. When the normal distribu—
tion does not hold (even after transformation), one can use the non—
parametric trend tests (Li et al., 2013; Schaid et al., 2005; Zhang
and Li, 2015) to analyze one SNP at a time with or without con—
sidering the genetic models and then employ the proposed method
to construct the omnibus test. If the phenotype is ordinal, the score
test derived from the proportional odds model (McCullagh, 1980)
can be first used to obtain the P—value for each SNP, and then the
P—values can be combined using the proposed method.

From the simulations, the power difference between the GCP
and other methods may be attributable to the number of markers
associated with the diseases. For the dependence on the data struc—
ture, the GCP can obtain more power than other methods when
each group has a certain amount of P—values. The distributions of P—
values have been shown in Figure 5 and Figure S1 in the Online
Supplementary Material. While, as the increasing of the number of
associated markers, the power of all the methods will increase and
then the power difference between the GCP and others may reduce.
The simulation results also show that the GCP performs better than
the FCT, TPM and TTS consistently. Towards the ARTP, the GCP
has obtained a uniformly higher power when the data are generated
using t—copula. For the Gaussian—copula, the GCP and ARTP have
its own ‘sweet’ spots. But overall, the power difference between the
GCP and ARTP is larger for t—copula than that for Gaussian—copula,
please see Figures 2—4. Therefore, our method is more robust than
the ARTP if the assumption of normality is not considered.

However, the proposed method has some drawbacks. First, as
difficulty of deriving the exact distribution of the GCP, we need to
use empirical cumulative distribution to obtain its P—value. In a

large—scale genetic association study, for example, when m is large,
say a million or bigger, the computation can be very intensive. Also,
the distribution function of the GCP cannot be computed. Second,
theoretically, the number of groups (I) does not depend on the num—
ber of SNPs. However, in practice, we don’t know ], the data—driven
selection of ] might be slightly correlated with the number of SNPs.
Third, the proposed method is constructed based on the individual
P—values, which can be obtained by single—marker analysis. For the
selection of the thresholds, we proposed to use 0.001 and 0.05.
They are not optimal and depend on the structure of the data. To
overcome it, one possible scheme is to adopt some alternative
thresholds and use the maximum of the GCP on these thresholds as
the final test statistics and use the bootstrap or permutation to assess
its statistical significance.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We introduce GO-Elite, a flexible and powerful pathway
analysis tool for a wide array of species, identifiers (IDs), pathways,
ontologies and gene sets. In addition to the Gene Ontology (GO), GO-
Elite allows the user to perform over-representation analysis on any
structured ontology annotations, pathway database or biological IDs
(e.g. gene, protein or metabolite). GO-Elite exploits the structured
nature of biological ontologies to report a minimal set of non-
overlapping terms. The results can be visualized on WikiPathways
or as networks. Built-in support is provided for over 60 species and
50 ID systems, covering gene, disease and phenotype ontologies,
multiple pathway databases, biomarkers, and transcription factor
and microRNA targets. GO-Elite is available as a web interface,
GenMAPP-CS plugin and as a cross-platform application.

1 INTRODUCTION

The analysis of pathways, ontologies and other gene sets has become
the preferred method for biologists looking to identify global trends
from genomic datasets. Although a myriad of tools exist for pathway
over-representation, few consider the structured nature of associated
ontology data, alternative ontologies and diverse gene sets; few
support a wide array of genomes or biological measurements, and
they are often limited in scope (Huang da et al., 2009).

Unlike ontologies, pathways provide valuable qualitative contexts
(interactions, reactions, metabolites and cellular compartments) that
highlight biological relevance. Although various pathway resources
now exist (Soh et (11., 2010), most over-representation analysis
(ORA) tools are limited to one resource that is often outdated.
To address these deﬁciencies, GO-Elite was developed to provide
an interchangeable and updatable model of pathway, ontology,
species and gene ID system relationships. Using these relationships,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

GO-Elite performs ontology pruning to report a minimally non-
redundant set of results (Fig. 1). Multiple options for running
GO-Elite exist: source-code, cross-platform binaries, Opal web
service (Ren et (11., 2010), online interface or as extensions
to the programs GenMAPP-CS (http://www.genmapp.org/) and
AltAnalyze (http://www.altanalyze.org). The stand-alone versions
of GO-Elite provide an intuitive user interface and command-line
control. As previously shown, GO-Elite can be applied to a broad
range of biological applications and data types (Hochstenbach et (11.,
2010; Lemay et al., 2009).

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Database architecture

Users working with GO-Elite can create their own databases (species, 1D
systems, relationships) or download ofﬁcial GO-Elite species databases
available for each release of Ensembl. The ofﬁcial databases are created
primarily from the Ensembl database, which include all external 1D systems
related to Ensembl (e.g. EntrezGene, UniProt, EMBL) as well as supported
microarray platforms (e.g. Affymetrix, Agilent, Codelink, Illumina). The
database is augmented with relationships directly from NCBI EntrezGene
and Affymetrix. Currently, relationships to multiple biological Ontology
[Gene Ontology (GO), Disease and Phenotype], pathway (WikiPathways,
PathwayCommons, KEGG) and gene set resources (e.g. PAZAR, Amadeus,
miRanda, RNAhybrid, InterProt and Lineage Biomarkers) are supported
(Supplementary Methods). In addition to gene relationships, metabolomics
analyses are available for WikiPathways and KEGG. Although only a
select few (1D) systems link directly to pathway and ontology annotations
[Ensembl, EntrezGene and HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca)] by default, all
secondary 1D systems (e.g. Affymetrix, RefSeq, MGI and Symbol) connect
to these through relationship tables. Thus, users can import and analyze 1D
lists for dozens of supported or user added 1D systems.

All resources and annotations provided by GO-Elite can be easily updated
or further customized using built-in importers. These importers connect
online to the various resources (e.g. WikiPathways, GO and Ensembl) or
import local relationships from multiple ﬁle formats (e.g. GPML, BioPax and
GMT). Alternative ontologies can also be added in GO-Elite, by specifying
the URL for any OBO ontology ﬁle and importing a species-speciﬁc ontology
1D relationship ﬁle through the user interface.

2.2 Optimized pathway over-representation

For ORA, ontologies, pathways and gene sets are analyzed by a method
similar to the program MAPPFinder (Doniger at al., 20035). GO-Elite
ranks each analyzed term according to a Z-score, calculated with a normal

Fig. 1. GO-Elite workﬂow and information sources. Before performing
ORA, users create two text ﬁles containing a list of input IDs (e.g. regulated
genes) and a denominator list (e.g. all genes examined), source ID type
(e.g. Affymetrix) and numerical values (optional). These IDs are mapped
to a primary ID system (EntrezGene, Ensembl, HMD or custom) for
ORA upon pathways, ontologies or loaded gene sets. Regulated genes
and metabolites can be immediately viewed on WikiPathways using the
stand-alone or GenMAPP-CS interface. Pathway or ontology summarized
expression values can be clustered and Visualized outside of GO-Elite

approximation to the hypergeometric distribution along with a permutation
or a Fisher’s exact test P-Value. False-discovery rate adjusted P-values
are calculated using a BenjaminiiHochberg correction (Reiner et al.,
2003).

The ontology ORA results from this step are further evaluated by a
simple yet robust pruning method. Pruning occurs by importing these ORA
statistics (Z-score, P-values and gene counts), matching user-deﬁned or
default ﬁltering options and building all unique branch paths of these results
based on the ontology tree structure. Branch paths are pruned to obtain the
nodes with the largest Z-score relative to all corresponding child and parent
nodes, to report the most informative, highest scoring term for a network of
related terms (Supplementary Methods).

The compared scores can be optionally weighted based on the number of
IDs associated with each term. This adjustment can result in more or less
reported results, by favoring higher level parent nodes with more associated
genes, resulting in up to an 80% reduction in the number of reported terms
(Supplementary Table).

Since several alternative ORA methods exist, such as GSEA (Huang da
et al., 2009), users wishing to load results from such algorithms can restrict
their analysis to this pruning step.

2.3 Data representation

From these analysis steps, multiple results ﬁles are produced. The most
informative of these is the pruned summary report, which includes all
summary term statistics and associated gene or metabolite symbols for
both ontology and non-ontology terms. Gene content redundancy between
reported terms is also provided, to highlight unrelated terms with similar or
identical gene content. When numerical values, such as fold changes, are
included with each input ID, GO-Elite will also report mean and standard
deviation ontology/pathway-level values in this summary ﬁle, analogous
to GO-Quant (Yu et al., 2006), allowing for downstream pathway-level
expression clustering (Supplementary Methods).

In addition, a full list of ontology and pathway statistics, associated
IDs (e.g. gene symbol and associated Ensembl), comparison of reported
ontology/pathway statistics between input ﬁles (where applicable) and
additional gene redundancy focused ﬁles are provided. Regulated genes and
metabolites can also be immediately Visualized on WikiPathways in the
stand-alone interface or following GenMAPP-CS analysis. Relationships
between all regulated IDs and ORA terms can also be easily Visualized
as networks in Cytoscape using produced output ﬁles (Supplementary
Methods).

This application should be of considerable interest to the genomics
community, as itrepresents a highly customizable, simple to use and powerful
framework for minimal ontology/pathway reporting. As GO-Elite is agnostic
to the type of data input (e.g. gene, protein or metabolite), source ontology,
pathway or gene set, we hope to rely further on community-contributed
content to improve the utility of this tool in the years to come.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most approaches used to identify cancer driver genes
focus, true to their name, on entire genes and assume that a gene,
treated as one entity, has a specific role in cancer. This approach may
be correct to describe effects of gene loss or changes in gene expres-
sion; however, mutations may have different effects, including their
relevance to cancer, depending on which region of the gene they
affect. Except for rare and well-known exceptions, there are not
enough data for reliable statistics for individual positions, but an inter-
mediate level of analysis, between an individual position and the entire
gene, may give us better statistics than the former and better reso-
lution than the latter approach.

Results: We have developed e-Driver, a method that exploits the in-
ternal distribution of somatic missense mutations between the pro-
tein’s functional regions (domains or intrinsically disordered regions)
to find those that show a bias in their mutation rate as compared with
other regions of the same protein, providing evidence of positive
selection and suggesting that these proteins may be actual cancer
drivers. We have applied e-Driver to a large cancer genome dataset
from The Cancer Genome Atlas and compared its performance with
that of four other methods, showing that e-Driver identifies novel
candidate cancer drivers and, because of its increased resolution,
provides deeper insights into the potential mechanism of cancer
driver genes identified by other methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

The landscape of cancer somatic mutations revealed by projects
such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Chang et al., 2013)
or the International Cancer Genome Consortium (Hudson et al.,
2010) is overwhelmingly complex, as hundreds of thousands of
different mutations, ranging from large genomic rearrangements
to point missense mutations, have been identified in different
cancer samples (Ciriello et al., 2013, Kandoth et al., 2013).
Several approaches have been developed to identify which
genes are likely driving the carcinogenic process (driver genes).
Such methods rely on the hypothesis that driver genes should be

under positive selection in the cancer environment. Methods in
this category include those that try to identify genes with higher-
than-expected-by-chance mutation rates, such as MuSiC (Dees
et al., 2012), or those that tend to accumulate highly damaging
mutations, such as OncodriveFM (Gonzalez-Perez and Lopez-
Bigas, 2012). More recently, methods that focus on the internal
distribution of mutations along a protein have also been de-
veloped. For example, OncodriveCLUST (Tamborero et al.,
2013b) looks for regions of proteins with higher-than-expected
mutation rates, which makes it optimal for the identiﬁcation of
gain-of-function sites that, while being key for the carcinogenic
process, would otherwise be missed. Another similar idea is
ActiveDriver (Reimand and Bader, 2013), which tries to identify
phosphorylation sites that are recurrently mutated in cancer.
One of the differences between the two methods is that
ActiveDriver tests the mutation frequencies of predeﬁned regions
(a phosphorylation site and its neighboring amino acids),
whereas OncodriveCLUST ﬁrst looks for potential seeds of
highly mutated clusters and then tries to extend them.

Here we present e-Driver, a novel method that identiﬁes pro-
tein functional regions (PFRs) that show a bias in their mutation
rates. In this context, PFRs can be either domains or intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs). Our method is based on the assump-
tion that different PFRs within the same protein mediate
different functions and, thus, might have distinct roles in carcino-
genesis. This becomes evident when describing proteins in terms
of functional networks. In such networks, nodes represent differ-
ent proteins, and edges between nodes represent functional
relationships between them, such as physical interactions or
post-translational modiﬁcations. Different edges leading to the
same node/ protein are usually mediated by different PFRs within
that same protein, and mutations in the PFR mediating one edge
will have different consequences than mutations in another PFR
mediating a different edge. For example, if an enzyme contains a
catalytic domain and an IDR that is phosphorylated, it is likely
that the consequences of a missense mutation disrupting the cata-
lytic domain will be different from those of a missense mutation
affecting the phosphorylation site or a truncating mutation that
disrupts both PFRs at the same time. Our method exploits this
idea, which has been previously used to analyze mutations asso-
ciated with Mendelian disorders (Zhong et al., 2009, Wang et al.,
2012), by looking for PFRs that show a bias in their mutation
rate.

We have applied e-Driver to the cancer genomic dataset from
the pan-cancer project of TCGA. This dataset has also been
analyzed with four other methods (MuSiC, OncodriveFM,
OncodriveCLUST and ActiveDriver), allowing us to compare

the results obtained with e-Driver with those obtained by meth-
ods relying on other approaches used to identify the signals of
positive selection (Tamborero et al., 2013a).

2 METHODS
2.1 Identiﬁcation of the driver PF Rs

e-Driver is based on the hypothesis that not all functional regions of a
given protein may be equally relevant for carcinogenesis. If this is the
case, it should be reﬂected in the distribution of missense mutations along
the protein, with regions under selection showing enrichment or depletion
of such mutations compared with regions with random (assumed to be
passenger) mutations.

To identify PFRs under selection pressure, e-Driver ﬁrst retrieves all
missense mutations in a cancer cohort located in any given protein as well
as the mutation coordinates and maps them to the protein’s functional
regions. Then, for every PFR, we use a binomial test to check whether the
observed number of mutations in this protein region (MR in Figure 1b) is
biased. We assume that each mutation is an independent event, and that
all residues of the protein have the same probability of being mutated.
Then, given the total number of mutations in the protein (MT in
Figure 1b), and the lengths of the region and the protein, we can calculate
the probability of observing at least MR mutations in the region under
the null hypothesis that the mutations are distributed randomly across the
protein. Once the P-values of all the regions of all the mutated proteins in
the cohort are obtained, the BenjaminiiHochberg false discovery rate
algorithm is applied to correct for multiple testing. Those regions with
a Q-value< 0.05 are considered as candidate driver regions. The whole
process is explained in Figure 1 in the example of PIK3R1 and its func-
tional regions.

2.2 PFR annotations

We deﬁned PFRs as sections of the protein coding for individual protein
domains and IDRs. We decided to include IDRs because they can also
contain important functional regions such as phosphorylation sites or
regions that regulate or mediate protein interactions (Dunker et al., 2005).

To identify protein domains, we retrieved, for each protein isoform
from ENSEMBL, annotated Pfam domains (Punta et al., 2012) as well as
putative novel protein domains located in regions with no previous
domain annotations, as predicted using the AIDA server (Xu et al.,
2014). We used Foldindex (Prilusky and Felder, 2005) to predict IDRs
for each protein, including in our analysis those regions with a predicted
unfolded score below 70.1.

Finally, we mapped the different missense somatic mutations of each
tumor to these PFRs, giving us a total of 66 492 altered regions in 14421
genes based on data from 3205 tumor samples (see below). Among the
66492 regions, we have 36626 Pfam domain instances, 4626 putative
domains predicted by the AIDA server and 25 240 IDRs. The features
can overlap, as the predictions were performed independently and there is
no reason why, for example, an IDR cannot overlap with (or even be
located within) a Pfam domain. For the sake of simplicity, we discuss
results obtained for only the longest isoform of each gene (e-Driver re-
sults for all the ENSEMBL isoforms can be found in the Supplementary
Table S2).

2.3 TCGA mutation dataset

We have downloaded the dataset that was used in the TCGA pan-cancer
driver analysis (syn1729383). To compare our results with the ones
obtained in the TCGA pan-cancer analysis, we applied the same ﬁlters
to the dataset, excluding 71 samples that were considered to be hypermu-
tators (Tamborero et al., 2013a). After ﬁltering, the ﬁnal dataset consists
of 3205 tumor samples with 287 822 coding missense mutations.

2.4 Predicted driver genes by the other four methods

To assess the value of our method, we compared our results with those
obtained by four different methods used previously to predict high-
conﬁdence gene drivers in the TCGA pan-cancer project: MuSiC,
OncodriveFM, OncoCLUST and ActiveDriver (Tamborero et al.,
2013a). We downloaded the results obtained in this analysis for three
of the four methods: OncodriveFM (syn1701498), OncodriveCLUST
(syn1701498) and MuSiC (syn1713813). As no ActiveDriver results for
the whole genome were available on the repository describing the pan-
cancer analysis, we used ActiveDriver results described in another paper
(Reimand et al., 2013) that, according to their authors, have been ob-
tained with similar TCGA mutation data (3185 cancer genomes,
syn2237931). Therefore, the results shown here for ActiveDriver are
slightly different than those described in the pan-cancer analysis.

2.5 Tissue-speciﬁc drivers

We classiﬁed the 3205 tumor genomes into their corresponding 11 tissues
of origin, obtaining 11 tissue-speciﬁc datasets that were then analyzed
individually with e-Driver. We then again corrected for multiple testing
by considering as positive only those PFRs with a Q-value <0.05.

3 RESULTS

3.1 e-Driver identiﬁes known cancer drivers

To assess the validity of our method, we reanalyzed the pan-
cancer dataset of TCGA. This dataset contains mutation data
for 3205 tumor samples that come from 11 different types of
tumors and contains 287 822 missense mutations. The dataset
has been previously analyzed using four different state-of-the-
art methods to predict cancer drivers from mutation data
(MuSiC, OncodriveFM, OncoCLUST and ActiveDriver).

When applying our method to this dataset, we identiﬁed 74
protein regions in 51 genes, showing a bias in their mutation rate
when compared with the rest of the protein (Figure 2a,
Supplementary Table S1). Among these 51 genes, 23 are included
in the Cancer Gene Census (CGC), a curated list of 512 cancer
drivers (Futreal et al., 2004). This represents a strong enrichment
in CGC genes in our list of candidate drivers when compared
with random expectation (Figure 2b, odds ratio>25,
P—Value<1e-16). As shown in Figure 2a, 31 of the 51 genes pre-
dicted by e-Driver (61%) are also identiﬁed by other methods.
The highest overlap of e-Driver predictions is with predictions
from OncodriveFM and MuSiC, with 21 of 51 genes (41%)
being common. Regarding genes included in the CGC, 22 of
the 23 genes identiﬁed by e-Driver (96%) that belong to this
list also have some other signal of positive selection, as they
are also predicted by other methods.

Interestingly, there is one gene in the CGC, CREBBP, that has
not been identiﬁed by any of the other four methods but was
picked up by e-Driver. The CREBBP protein does not show any
speciﬁc cluster of mutations nor is it recurrently mutated in
cancer, which could explain why it is not recognized as a poten-
tial cancer driver by the other methods. Nevertheless, its muta-
tion pattern shows a strong bias, as the acetyltransferase domain,
located between amino acids 1345 and 1639 (12% of the pro-
tein’s length), contains 20 of the 60, or 30%, of all the mutations
found in this gene (Q-Value<0.02).

There is one other acetyltransferase domain in the EP300 gene
that is also enriched in somatic mutations and identiﬁed by

Fig. 1. e-Driver’s workﬂow shown in the example of the analysis of PIK3R1 mutation data from TCGA. (a) e-Driver ﬁrst retrieves all missense
mutations in a protein. It then identiﬁes its PFRs, such as Pfam domains or IDRs. For example, in the case of PIK3R1, the protein contains four
different Pfam domains (one SH3 domain, one RhoGAP domain and two SH2 domains) and two distinct IDRs. The predictions are independent and,
thus, can overlap, as in the case of the second IDR and the second SH2 domain. e-Driver iterates through every functional region, calculating the P-
values of the mutation distribution using a Fisher’s test that takes into account the mutation rates and lengths of both the region of interest and the
protein. (b) Example of the calculations for the IDRb in PIK3R1. MR is the number of mutations in the region being studied; MT is the total number of
mutations in the protein. Given that 29 of the 43 mutations happening in PIK3R1 are located in its second IDR, as the length of the region is of 227
aminoacids and the protein is 732 aminoacids long, we would expect only 13 mutations in this region. Thus, using the binomial test, the P-value for the
observed number of mutations is 2.1 e'6. (c) Each of the different PFRs in PIK3R1 performs different functions. For example, the first SH2 domain is
responsible for the interactions with GRB2 and PTPN6 (blue edges), whereas the second SH2 domain mediates the interaction with PDGFRB (green
edge) and the second IDR mediates the interaction with PIK3CA (red edge). ((1) It is likely that missense mutations in the SH2b domain of PIK3R1 will
disrupt, among others, its interaction with PDGFRB without altering the rest of the network. Given that this region is not enriched in cancer somatic
mutations, the functions/interactions mediated by this domain are unlikely to be oncogenic. (e) On the other hand, IDRb is strongly enriched in somatic
mutations; thus, edges mediated by this region, such as the physical interaction with PIK3CA, are likely to be relevant to carcinogenesis. (f) The
mutations in PIK3R1 (the white helical protein) IDRb region (shown in red) cluster around the region that interacts with PIK3CA (shown in brown).

e-Driver. This gene is also included in the CGC and is also iden-
tiﬁed by MuSiC and OncodriveFM but not by OncodriveCLUST
or ActiveDriver. This observation suggests that, while EP300 is
frequently mutated in cancer, its mutations show no particular
clustering. However, by using e-Driver, we can identify the spe-
ciﬁc region of the protein that is enriched in mutations.

3.2 e-Driver ﬁnds potential novel drivers

We then reviewed the remaining 28 genes that are identiﬁed as
potential drivers by our method but are not included in the CGC.

Eight of them had also been identiﬁed by, at least, one other
method, supporting their potential roles as cancer drivers. For
example, our method, as well as OncodriveFM, identiﬁed
the MGA gene as a potential driver. This gene encodes a dual-
speciﬁcity transcription factor that regulates expression of
Myc/MAX target genes. It suppresses the transcriptional activa-
tion by Myc and inhibits Myc-dependent cell transformation.
The domain identified by e-Driver is the helix-loop-helix
domain between positions 2425 and 2474 that contains 8 of
the 46 mutations identified in this protein (odds ratio 13,

Q-Value<0.001) and that mediates the binding of the protein to
E-boxes in the DNA. Additional evidence in favor of the car-
cinogenic role of MGA comes from a recent study (Lawrence
et al., 2014) using a larger genomic dataset with 4742 cancer
samples in which, thanks to an increase in sample size and stat-
istical power, MGA could be identiﬁed by MuSiC. As for the
other seven genes that were also predicted by other methods, five
of them were included in the list of 258 high-conﬁdence drivers
described in the pan-cancer driver analysis: FRGlB, NBPF10,
DHX9, POTEF and RPSAP58. This result agrees with previous
observations that genes predicted by more than a single method
are likely to be true cancer drivers (Tamborero et al., 2013a) and
confirms the power of our method to identify genes relevant to
the disease.

Among the remaining 20 genes that are not part of the CGC
and that are not identiﬁed by any other method, we have found
several potential drivers. For example, we identiﬁed two mem-
bers of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, NBPF12 and
NBPF20, as having regions with strong enrichment in mutations.
These two genes belong to the same family as NBPF10, one of
the genes included in the list of high-confidence drivers of the
pan-cancer analysis. Interestingly, the disordered regions identi-
ﬁed by e-Driver from NBPF12 and NBPF20 have a 94% iden-
tity, suggesting that their potential driver role might be achieved
through similar mechanisms. Other interesting genes identiﬁed
uniquely by our method include POTEM, a protein that belongs
to the same family as the high-conﬁdence driver POTEF. As in
NBPF proteins, the regions identiﬁed in POTEM and POTEF
are IDRs; however, in this case, they do not show any homology.

Another interesting fact about POTEF is that the region identi-
fied by e-Driver does not show an enrichment in cancer somatic
mutations but instead a depletion, suggesting that the conserva-
tion of this PFR is important for the survival of cancer cells and
for POTEF’s role as a driver.

3.3 Tissue-speciﬁc candidate PF R drivers

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and it is known that muta-
tions driving one type of cancer might be completely irrelevant
for another. Thus, although the pan-cancer dataset has more
statistical power because of its larger size, it is possible that
there are tissue-speciﬁc drivers that cannot be detected in the
pan-cancer dataset. To explore that possibility, we divided the
pan-cancer genomes into 11 tissue-speciﬁc smaller datasets and
analyzed each of them using e-Driver.

Although most PFRs have a stronger signal in the pan-cancer
dataset than in any tissue dataset (Figure 3a, black dots), others
have stronger tissue-speciﬁc signals (Figure 3a, gray dots). This is
the case, for example, in FLT3’s kinase domain, which is mostly
mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (17/23 mutations in this
domain happen in this type of cancer). Another example is
EGFR, which has two clearly different mutation patterns in glio-
blastoma and lung adenocarcinoma (Figure 3b). In glioblastoma,
it is Domain II of EGFR’s extracellular region that is mostly
affected by missense mutations (Domain IV seems to be also
strongly mutated, although, as it is not annotated in Pfam, it
has not been analyzed by e-Driver), and there are almost no
mutations in the kinase domain. On the other hand, in lung
adenocarcinoma, there are almost no mutations in the extracel-
lular region and most mutations are located in the kinase domain
of this protein.

There are 11 PFRs in 10 different proteins that can be identi-
fied in only the tissue-specific datasets (Pancan qva1>0.05,
Tissue qval<0.05, Table 1). These tissue-speciﬁc candidate dri-
vers are strongly enriched in genes with known cancer roles, as 8
of 10 proteins are part of the CGC. Besides the identiﬁcation of
EGFR’s kinase domain (Pf07714) in lung adenocarcinoma that
has been explained above, there are other interesting examples
in the list. For example, although most PIK3CA mutations are
located in the Pf00613 domain (including the well-studied
E545K) and happen in a variety of cancer types, the Pf02192
domain, also known as the ABD domain, is mostly mutated in
endometrial cancer.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Here we evaluated the hypothesis that some cancer driver genes
might accumulate mutations in only those functional regions
(domains or disordered regions) that are relevant to the disease.
To test this idea, we have developed a novel approach, e-Driver,
and applied it to one of the largest available datasets of cancer
genomic data, the TCGA’s pan-cancer project. Our method
checks for each PFR whether it shows a bias in its mutation
rate when compared with the rest of the protein. As it uses mu-
tation data only for individual proteins, e-Driver, unlike other
methods that compare mutation rates of whole genes, does not
need to compensate for variations in mutation rates across the
entire genome (De and Michor, 2011). Another novelty of our

shows no bias in its mutation rate. However, in lung adenocarcinoma, it seems that only the kinase domain is relevant, as most mutations (19/21 , 90%)

are located in this type of domain

method is that protein domains and IDRs are usually larger than
the clusters identiﬁed by other methods. This feature is import-
ant, as small clusters of mutations are usually located in onco-
genes rather than in tumor-suppressor genes. By using larger
functional regions, we can identify tumor suppressors whose con-
tribution to carcinogenesis depends solely on the mutation status
of speciﬁc regions.

The advantages of our method are exempliﬁed in the identiﬁ-
cation of MGA using the TCGA dataset. This gene was not
mutated in enough samples to be identified by methods that
rely on the mutation frequency of the whole gene (in a recent
study with more cancer samples, these methods were able to
identify MGA as a potential cancer driver). Because this gene
acts as a tumor suppressor, the range of positions that can be
mutated for it to drive the tumor’s growth is too large to be

identiﬁed by OncodriveCLUST. However, its mutations tend
to accumulate in its helix-loop-helix domain rather than in the
rest of the protein, allowing e-Driver to find it.

One drawback that comes from the use of predeﬁned regions
is that if the gene has no such regions, or if the regions cover the
whole gene, the gene cannot be identiﬁed using our method. This
is the case, for example, in IDH1 and IDH2 W an et al., 2009).
These two known cancer driver genes encode single-domain
proteins. In this scenario, even though their only PFRs are
frequently mutated in cancer and show clusters of mutations,
e-Driver cannot identify them. However, such cases represent
<10% of all the human proteins and <3% of the proteins with
at least one mutation in TCGA (see Supplementary Table S3). It
is important to note that, just like most other methods that rely
on mutation frequencies to identify potential drivers, e-Driver
will also beneﬁt from the increase in the number of sequenced
cancer genomes, as the statistical power will be larger, allowing it
to identify novel regions (Supplementary Figure S2).

Proteins enriched in mutations in an unannotated region (such
as EGFR’s extracellular Domain IV) present another scenario in
which e-Driver will not be able to identify that speciﬁc region. In
this case, however, as long as the protein contains an annotated
PFR, e-Driver should be able to ﬁnd the protein, as it will pick
up the annotated PFR because of its lack of missense mutations.
Another interesting feature of e-Driver is that, as it detects which
PFRs are relevant for each type of cancer, it might also help in
deﬁning strategies to design and administer drugs. For example,
it has been recently shown that the two different patterns of
mutations that we observed in EGFR for glioblastoma and
lung adenocarcinoma have therapeutic implications as to which
type of EGFR inhibitors work in each case, as they deregulate
EGFR’s activity through different mechanisms (V ivanco et al.,
2012). Other example are PIK3CA’s Pf02192 and Pf00613 do-
mains, which are also driving different subsets of cancer and that

determine the response to the IGFlR inhibitor AEW541 (Porta-
Pardo and Godzik, unpublished data).

Overall, we have shown that our approach can identify both
well-known oncogenes as well as novel candidate cancer drivers.
Moreover, because of direct connections between protein regions
and specific elements of the protein function, it can also provide
further hypotheses of the mechanisms of driver genes. Given the
complexity of the problem of identifying cancer drivers, it is
likely that the combination of multiple approaches looking for
distinct signals of positive selection is going to be needed to get to
the final answer. For example, neither e-Driver nor any of the
other methods discussed here work with data regarding somatic
copy number variations, a type of mutation that can drive several
subsets of cancer (Ciriello et al., 2013). Here we have demon-
strated that e-Driver can provide a novel insightful and comple-
mentary View of the problem, contributing to its solution.

Abstract

Motivation: Next—generation sequencing technology is increasingly being used for clinical diag—
nostic tests. Clinical samples are often genomically heterogeneous due to low sample purity or
the presence of genetic subpopulations. Therefore, a variant calling algorithm for calling low—
frequency polymorphisms in heterogeneous samples is needed.

Results: We present a novel variant calling algorithm that uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to
estimate allele frequency and call variants in heterogeneous samples. We show that our algorithm
improves upon current classifiers and has higher sensitivity and specificity over a wide range of
median read depth and minor allele fraction. We apply our model and identify 15 mutated loci in
the PAXP1 gene in a matched clinical breast ductal carcinoma tumor sample; two of which are

likely loss—of—heterozygosity events.

1 Introduction

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has enabled the sys-
tematic interrogation of the genome for a fraction of the cost of
traditional assays (Koboldt et (11., 2013). Protocol and platform en-
gineering improvements have enabled the generation of l>< 109
bases of sequence data in 27 h for ~$1000 (Quail et (11., 2012). As a
result, NGS is increasingly being used as a general platform for
research assays for methylation state (Laird, 2010), DNA mutations
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium et (11., 2012), copy number vari-
ation (Alkan et (11., 2009), promoter occupancy (Ouyang et (11.,
2009) and others (Rivera and Ren, 2013). NGS diagnostics are
being translated to clinical applications including non-invasive fetal
diagnostics (Kitzman et (11., 2012), infectious disease diagnostics
(Capobianchi et (11., 2012), cancer diagnostics (Navin et (11., 2010),
and human microhiome analysis (The Human Microbiome Project
Consortium, 2013).

Increasingly, NGS is being used to interrogate mutations in
heterogeneous clinical samples. For example, NGS-hased non-
invasive fetal DNA testing uses maternal hlood sample to sequence
the minority fraction of cell-free fetal DNA (Fan et (11., 2008).
Infectious diseases such as HIV and influenza may contain
many genetically heterogeneous sub-populations (Flaherty et (11.,
2011; Ghedin et (11., 2010). DNA sequencing of individual regions
of a solid tumor has revealed genetic heterogeneous within an indi-
vidual sample (Navin et (11., 2010). Importantly, accounting for tech-
nical errors can drastically improve performance (Zagordi et (11.,
2010)

However, the primary statistical tools for calling variants from
NGS data are optimized for homogeneous samples. Samtools and
GATK use a naive Bayesian decision rule to call variants (DePristo
et (11., 2011; Li, 2011). GATK involves more sophisticate pre- and
post-processing steps wherein the genotype prior is fixed and

RVD2 improves on RVD in three ways. First, RVD2 has a Beta(110, Mo)
prior on local error rate 11,, which captures the global across—position
error rate. The prior distribution allows 11, to share information
across adjacent positions and allows RVD2 to handle low read
depths. Second, RVD2 handles multiple replicates in case samples.
Third, RVD2 has a more accurate Bayesian hypothesis testing
method compared with the normal z—test in RVD. We show a per—
formance comparison between RVD and RVD2 in Section 5.2.

3 Inference and Hypothesis Testing

The primary object of inference in this model is the joint posterior
distribution function over the latent variables,

: P(u.9.rln;¢)
perm) ’

where the parameters are (1) é{110, Mo, M}.

17017917.";40 (3)

The Beta distribution over 11, is conjugate to the Binomial distri—
bution over 0,,, so we can write the posterior distribution as a Beta
distribution. However, there is not a closed form for the product of
a Beta distribution with another Beta distribution, so exact inference
is intractable.

Instead, we have developed a Metropolis—within—Gibbs (MwG)
approximate inference algorithm shown in Algorithm 1. First, the
hyperparameters are initialized using method—of—moments (MoM).
Given those hyperparameter estimates, we sample from the mar—
ginal posterior distribution for 11, given its Markov blanket using a
Metropolis—Hasting (M—H) rejection sampling rule. Finally, we
sample from the marginal posterior distribution for 0,, given its
Markov blanket. Samples from 0,, can be drawn from the posterior
distribution directly because the prior and likelihood form a conju—
gate pair. This sampling procedure is repeated until the chain
converges to a stationary distribution and then we draw samples
from the posterior distribution over latent variables.

3.1 Initialization
The initial values for the model parameters and latent variables are
obtained by a MoM procedure. MoM works by setting the popula—
tion moment equal to the sample moment. A system of equations is
formed such that the number of moment equations is equal to the
number of unknown parameters and the equations are solved simul—
taneously to give the parameter estimates. We simply start with the
data matrices r and n and work up the hierarchy of the graphical
model solving for the parameters of each conditional distribution in
turn.

We present the initial parameter estimates here and provide the deriv—
ations in Supplementary Information. The MoM estimate for replicate—

3.2 Sampling from p(6i,-|ri,-, ni,,11,, M)

Samples from the posterior distribution p(0,~,~1r,~,~,n,~,~,11,,M,-)
are drawn analytically because of the Bayesian conjugacy be—
tween the prior p(0,~,~)11,~,M,)~Beta(11,-,M,~) and the likelihood
p(r,~,~1n,~,~, 0,,) ~ Binomial(0,~,~, n,,~). The posterior distribution is

17(911‘17’1‘1‘7101'7 1117M» N Beta (7,; + Mill/7111i - 7,7 + M,'(1 — 111)) (4)

3.3 Sampling from p(11,-|0,-1,M,-,110,M0)

The posterior distribution over 11, given its Markov blanket is
17(Hjlejiana H07MO) 0< P(ll/IH07MO)P(9/illl/7Mi) (5)

Since the prior, p(11,~)110,Mo), is not conjugate to the likelihood,
p(0,~,~111,,M,-), we cannot write an analytical form for the posterior
distribution. Instead, we sample from the posterior distribution
using the M—H algorithm.

A candidate sample is generated from the symmetric proposal

distribution Q<11ﬂ11§m> ~ N<111Ip), 6117)), where 11le) is the pth from

the posterior distribution. The acceptance probability is then

P(H}‘luo.Mo)P(9),-p+1)lu}2Mj)

: —. (6)
pm)”ruo.Mo>p<e§f“)ru§”.M.>

We fixed the proposal distribution variance for all the M—H
steps within a Gibbs iteration to 6, : 0.1 - 11,- - (1 — 11,) if 11,- 6 (10—3,
1 — 10—3) and c,- : 10—4 otherwise, where 11,- is the MoM estimator
of 11,. Though it is not theoretically necessary, we have found that
the algorithm performance improves when we take the median of
five or more M—H samples in single Gibbs step for each position.

We resample from the proposal if the sample is outside of the
support of the posterior distribution. We typically discard 20% of
the sample for burn—in and thin the chain by a factor of 2 to reduce
autocorrelation among samples. Since, each position i is exchange—
able given the global hyperparameters, 110 and M0, this sampling
step can be distributed across up to ] processors.

3.4 Posterior distribution test

3.4.1 Posterior difference test

MwG provides samples from the posterior distribution of 11, given
the case or control data. For notational simplicity, we define the

ﬁm'sreumofpiqxo'sopcuuqutotq/ﬁdnq

random variables associated with these two distributions 11frise and

11fontml and the associated samples as 171,”se and ﬁf‘mtml.

draw a sample from the posterior distribution 171/.A

The threshold, 1, may be set to 0 or optimized for a given median
depth and desired MAF detection limit. The optimal T maximizes
the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC),

t* : arg max {MCC(T)}. (8)

While we are able to compute the optimal 1 threshold for a test
dataset, in general we would not have access to 1*. With sufficient
training data, one would be able to develop a lookup table or cali—
bration curve to set I based on read depth and MAF level of interest.
Absent this information we set I : 0.

3.4.2 Posterior somatic test

We use a two—sided posterior difference test with control and
case paired samples to identify somatic mutations. We consider scen—
arios when the case(tumor) error rate is lower than the
control(germline) error rate (e.g. loss—of—heterozygosity) as well as scen—
arios when the case(tumor) error rate is higher than the
control(germline) error rate (e.g. homozygous somatic mutation).
The two hypothesis tests are then Pr (11me — 11fontml > t) > 1 — or and

1
Pr (11,fase — 11fontml < —t) > 1 — or. We typically set the threshold 1 to 0.

3.4.3 Posterior germline test

We use a one—sided posterior distribution test with a single control
sample to identify germline mutations. We call a germline mutation
if 11fontml 2 T with high confidence,

3.5 x2 test for non—uniform base distribution
An abundance of non—reference bases at a position called by the pos—
terior density test may be due to a true mutation or due to a random
sequencing error; we would like to differentiate these two scenarios.
We assume non—reference read counts caused by a non—biological
mechanism results in a uniform distribution over three non—reference
bases. In contrast, the distribution of counts among three non—
reference bases caused by biological mutation would not be uniform.
We use a x2 goodness—of—fit test on a multinomial distribution
over the non—reference bases to distinguish these two possible
scenarios. The null hypothesis is Ho : p : (171,172,173) where
171 : p2 : p3 : 1/3. Cressie and Read (1984) identified a power—
divergence family of statistics, indexed by 2», that includes as special
cases Pearson’s x20» : 1) statistic, the log likelihood ratio statistic
(2» : 0), the Freeman—Tukey statistic (2» : —1 / 2), and the Neyman
modified statistic X20» : —2). The test statistic is

[a 1 7

where 7)?) is the observed frequency for non—reference base k at pos—

ition /' in replicate i and I is the corresponding expected frequency

under the null hypothesis. Cressie and Read (1984) recommended
)1 : 2/ 3 when no knowledge of the alternative distribution is avail—
able and we choose that value.

We control for multiple hypothesis testing in two ways. We use
Fisher’s combined probability test (Fisher et al., 1970) to combine
the P—values for N replicates into a single P—value at position i,

N
91,2: 421m (mi). (11)

Equation (11) gives a test statistic that follows a )8 distribution
with 2N degrees of freedom when the null hypothesis is true. If the
sample average depth is higher than 500, we use the Benjamini—
Hochberg method to control the family—wise error rate over pos—
itions that have been called by the posterior distribution test
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Efron, 2010). The average depth
threshold is set because Benjamini—Hochberg method is a highly
conservative method and will reject many true calls when the read
depth is not high enough.

4 Datasets

We used two independent datasets to evaluate the performance of
RVD2 and compare it with other variant calling algorithms. The
synthetic DNA sequence data provide true positive and true negative
positions as well as define minor allele fractions. The HCC1187
data is used to test the performance on a sequenced cancer genome
with less than 100% tumor purity.

4.1 Synthetic DNA sequence data

4.1.1 Experimental methods

Two 400 bp DNA sequences (including linkers) that are identical ex—
cept at 14 loci with variant bases were synthesized and clonally iso—
lated. The samples with the mutations are taken as the case sample
and the sample without the mutations is taken as the control.
Aliquots of the case and control DNA were mixed at defined frac—
tions to yield defined minor allele fractions (MAFs) of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 10
and 100%. Paired—end sequencing was performed on an Illumina
GAIIx sequencer (Illumina SCS 2.8) with real—time image analysis
and base calling (Illumina RTA 2.8). Eland II (from Illumina pipe—
line version 1.6) was used with the default parameters to perform se—
quence alignment to the 300—bp synthetic DNA construct. More
details of the experimental protocol are available from the original
publication (Flaherty et al., 2011). As shown in Supplementary
Table 51, each sample has N1 000 000 35 bp paired end reads.

4.1.2 Pre-processing methods

The reads were aligned with Eland as described previously. We then
ran samtools mpileup with the —C50 option to filter for high mapping
quality reads. To simulate lower coverage data while retaining the
error structure of real NGS data, BAM files for the synthetic DNA
data were downsampled 10><, 100><, 1000>< and 10 000>< using
Picard v1.96. The final dataset contains read pairs for three replicates
of each case and pairs of reads three replicates for the control sample
giving N : 6 replicates for the control and each MAF level.

4.2 HCC1187 sequence data

4.2.1 Experimental methods

The HCC1187 dataset is a well—recognized baseline dataset from
Illumina for evaluating sequence analysis algorithms (Howarth
et al., 2011, 2007; Newman et al., 2013). The HCC1187 cell line

can be seen that positions 41, 75 and 77 are more likely mutated
while positions 1, 39, 54 and 84 are less likely mutated.

Strelka was the least sensitive algorithm among all the algo—
rithms. According to the technical report, Strelka identified position
26 (chr7:154760439) as variant, but did not call any other variants.
In particular Strelka missed the two LOH events called by RVD2.
VarScan2—somatic called most positions among all algorithms,
84 positions as shown in Figure 6a. VarScan2—somatic detected all
the positions called by RVD2 except position 39, which turns out to
be a very likely mutation given the depth distribution in Figure 6b.
VarScan2—somatic reported 65 positions which were not called
by any other three algorithms. The read depth in Supplementary
Table 51 suggests that these positions are very likely to be false posi—
tives. As shown in Figure 4, the FDR for VarScan2—somatic at read
depth 53 MAF level 1.0% is as high as 1.00. Spencer et al. (2013)
also mentioned that VarScan2 has tendency to call many false posi—
tives at high read depth.

6 Discussion

We describe here a novel algorithm for model estimation and hy—
pothesis testing for identifying single—nucleotide variants in hetero—
geneous samples using NGS data. Our algorithm has a higher
sensitivity and specificity than many other approaches for a range of
read depths and MAFs.

Our inference algorithm uses Gibbs sampling to do inference in
the RVD2 hierarchical empirical Bayes model. This sampling pro—
cedure provides a guarantee to identify the global optimal parameter
settings asymptotically. However, it may require many samples to
achieve that guarantee causing the algorithm to be slower than other
deterministic approaches. We opted for this balance of speed and ac—
curacy because computational time is often not limiting and the cost
of a false positive or false negative greatly outweighs the cost of
more computation. Another factor that can affect the speed of
RVD2 is the number of M—H sample within one Gibbs sampling
run. RVD2 is able to use multiple cores in parallel, which can signifi—
cantly improve time efficiency. In future studies, we plan to reduce
the computational cost by using more sophisticated MCMC sam—
pling methods or deterministic approximation methods such as vari—
ational EM or stochastic variational EM.

We have focused on the statistical model and hypothesis test in
this study and our results do not include any pre—filtration of errone—
ous reads or post—filtration of mutation calls beyond a simple quality
score threshold. Incorporation of such data—cleaning steps will likely
improve the accuracy of the algorithm.

Our approach does not address identification of indels, structural vari—
ants or copy number variants. Those mutations typically require specific
data analysis models and tests that are different than those for single—
nucleotide variants. Furthermore, analysis of RNA—seq data or other data
generated on the NGS platform may require different models that are
more appropriately tuned to the particular noise feature of that data.

The availability of clinical sequence data is increasing as the
technical capability to sequence clinical samples at low—cost im—
proves. Consequently, we require statistically accurate algorithms
that are able to call germline and somatic point mutations in hetero—
geneous samples with low purity. Such accurate algorithms are a
step toward greater access to genomics for clinical diagnostics.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protocols to generate strand-speciﬁc transcriptomes with
next-generation sequencing platforms have been used by the scien-
tific community roughly since 2008. Strand-specific reads allow for
detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression
profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. However,
applications making use of this strandedness information are still
scarce.

Results: Here we present a tool (Janus), which focuses on the iden-
tification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to
known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. Janus can
compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns
scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense/
antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. Janus is
able to make use of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and methylation
data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in
the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. Janus
interrogates positions of heterozygous SNVs to identify strand-speciﬁc
allelic imbalance.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ancient Greek historian Plutarch writes about Janus: ‘For
this Janus, whether in remote antiquity he were a demigod or a
king, was certainly a great lover of civil and social unity, and one

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

who reclaimed men from brutal and savage living; for which
reason they figure him with two faces, to represent the two
states and conditions out of the one of which he brought man-
kind, to lead them into the other.’ (Plutarchus, 75 ACE.) We
decided to call our tool Janus, as it observes transcription of the
double-stranded DNA, which often happens in opposite direc-
tions at a given locus. We term the transcription occurring on the
strand opposite to the template strand ‘antisense’ transcription.
Antisense transcripts may have a regulatory effect on the expres-
sion of the sense transcript, which has been reported for several
sense/antisense (S/AS) pairs before, for example, in the
X-chromosomal inactivation involving XIS T and TSIX
(Ng et al., 2007). Another example is given by Morris et al.,
who reported that expression of the p21 antisense transcript me-
diates methylation of the p21 sense promoter by recruitment of
epigenetic regulatory complexes and showed that this effect
was reversible by small interfering RNA (siRNA)—induced
knockdown of the antisense transcript (Morris et al., 2008).
Published data about antisense transcription are sometimes
contradictory, underlining the high complexity of the matter.
In 2008, He et a]. published an article in which they investigated
S/AS patterns in different human cell lines using the Illumina
GA, detecting a high abundance of antisense tags within exons
(He et al., 2008). In contrast, in an article published by
Klevebring et a]. in 2010, who used the SOLiD system, only
few antisense tags were detected in the coding regions of genes
(Klevebring et al., 2010). However, both articles agree on an
abundance of antisense transcription occurring in promoter
and terminator regions. To the best of our knowledge, no pub-
licly available tool has been released to the scientiﬁc community
to easily identify S/AS pairs using next-generation sequencing
data. To address this, we developed Janus. It allows identifica-
tion of S/AS pairs on the genome-wide level, using common
input formats of sequencing data from strand-speciﬁc experi-
ments, and detects differences between multiple samples. It is
capable of including methylation data in the results and investi-
gates S/AS ratios at single-nucleotide variant (SNV) positions.
Janus was developed to work under Linux and Windows, but is
restricted to 64-bit environments owing to the memory
requirements.

Fig. 1. Janus workﬂow. Input ﬁles are marked by circles and ﬁnal ana-
lysis output in boxes shaded in gray. Janus generates wig ﬁles from a
BAM ﬁle, which is the primary input. The wig ﬁles can be converted into
bigwigs and are used to estimate the level of antisense noise and to detect
transcriptionally active regions. To determine the location of an antisense
event relative to other transcripts, Janus depends on a gene annotation
ﬁle, which can be either a refGene.txt ﬁle or a GTF ﬁle. Finally, Janus
detects antisense events above the estimated background noise and an-
notates them using the gene annotation ﬁle. Optionally, Janus can in-
corporate methylation data. Multiple lists of S/AS pairs can be compared
with Janus to detect differentially expressed and equally co-expressed
S/AS pairs. Additionally, Janus includes the functionality to determine
AS:S ratios in proximity of methylation sites, quantify the amount of
antisense transcription in promoter and terminator regions and the ability
to detect strand-speciﬁc allelic imbalance

2 METHODS

The workﬂow of Janus is shown in Figure 1. Janus expects a BAM ﬁle as
input, which is currently the most commonly used output format for
mapped reads. Reads from the BAM ﬁle are used to generate one wig
ﬁle per chromosome and strand. For further analysis, a transcript anno-
tation ﬁle in gene transfer format (GTF) is required. Janus is designed to
convert an existing GTF ﬁle or the refGene.txt, which can be obtained by
the table browser of the UCSC homepage (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-
bin/hgTables), into a merged GTF ﬁle that contains one entry per gene
symbol, including the merged meta-exons of all transcript isoforms of the
same gene. Even if the annotation ﬁle is already in the GTF format, we
recommend running the built-in converter of Janus to improve the results.
Other GTF ﬁles, i.e. those that were not modiﬁed by Janus, may be used,
but might generate multiple similar results for different isoforms of the
same gene.

Using the reference annotation, the level of ‘antisense-noise’ is calcu-
lated (Supplementary Fig. S1). We deﬁne this noise as transcription on
the opposite strand of known exons, which is a result of imperfect library
generation and mismapping of reads. Often, transcription extends beyond
the 3’-end of annotated transcripts. As this would bias the noise estima-
tion in case of two adjacent transcripts in tail-to-tail orientation, we ex-
clude exons within 1 kb of other exons on the opposite strand. The mean
and standard deviation of the noise are calculated and reported in a
detailed tab-delimited ﬁle for every investigated meta-exon. Mean and
standard deviation are reported in a stats ﬁle that also contains the total

pairs) are shown in lighter colors

coverage of the sample. The wig ﬁles are used to identify transcriptional
active regions (TARs) (Supplementary Fig. S2). Three criteria must be
met for a TAR to be regarded as an antisense event. First, the TAR must
have a minimum length (default = 51 bp) and minimum average coverage
per base (default: 5). The coverage criterion uses unnormalized values,
i.e. the raw mapped coverage for the identiﬁcation of TARs. Second, on
the strand opposite to the identiﬁed TAR, transcription must occur
within a given distance (default: 10 kb). Third, each TAR requires an
antisense- to sense-transcription ratio above the estimated noise level.
Events that do not differ by more than 1.94 standard deviations
(P 5 0.05) from the mean noise level are discarded. An antisense event
is regarded as known if it is overlapping an exon on the same strand and
novel otherwise. Each antisense event is classiﬁed depending on its loca-
tion in relation to the sense event (Fig. 2).

Janus includes the functionality to compare antisense events of mul-
tiple samples to identify differences in gene expression that might affect
only one strand or both strands equally. Supplementary Figure S3A7C
illustrates possible types of AS events, which show equally strong expres-
sion as the sense transcript and Supplementary Figure S3D an S/AS pair
with mutually exclusive expression of either the sense or antisense tran-
script. The workﬂow to identify potential self-regulatory S/AS pairs is
shown in Figure 3. First, all overlapping antisense events are merged for
all samples, and expression values are calculated for each strand and
sample. The expression values are normalized by event length and total
genomic coverage before scoring. Two quality scores are incorporated in
the scoring algorithm: the mean value of covered length to full event
length (scorel) and the number of samples that have a minimum coverage
of 1 for the whole event (score4). For identiﬁcation of differential ex-
pressed S/AS pairs, two scores based on the AS:S ratio are used: the
mean of the difference of the AS:S ratio from an equal distribution
(1:1) and the distance between the minimum and maximum AS:S ratio.
For the ﬁnal score, the four sub-scores are weighted differently. The two
scores representing the quality of the AS event (scorel and score4) are
weighted double, while the two scores concerning the AS/ S ratios (scorez
and score3) are weighted triple, reﬂecting their higher importance for the
detection of differential expression. Additionally, a ﬂag is generated that
marks the more extreme cases, in which one sample shows an AS:S ratio
below 0.2 and another above 0.8 representing empirical borders deter-
mined from our training dataset.

The chosen scoring algorithm was not designed to preferentially iden-
tify S/AS events exhibiting the same expression level on both strands, as

Fig. 3. Scoring algorithm for S/AS pairs. First the lists of antisense events
detected in different samples are merged and overlapping events fused
into single events. S/AS ratios are calculated and expression values are
normalized for total genomic coverage and event length. Antisense events
are given scores for mutually exclusive expression. All scores, including
the total score, are between 0 and 1. Score] represents the fraction of the
event that was covered. Soorez ((Fl) marks the distance of the event’s
S/AS ratio to an equal expression on both strands. Score3 calculates the
maximum S/AS-ratio-distance between the sample with the lowest S/AS
ratio to the sample with the highest S/AS ratio. Additionally, a ﬂag
(either TRUE or FALSE) is generated, which tells the user if a sample
with a very low and another with a very high S/AS ratio was detected.
Score4 represents the fraction of samples that achieved a normalized
coverage of at least 1. The total score weights all four scores in slight
favor of the expression ratios

this will not commonly be the case in regulatory events. However, it is
possible to ﬁlter for them using additional parameters, which are also
calculated during the scoring step for differential expressed S/AS pairs
(Fig. 4). Samples are grouped by their AS:S ratio for a given S/AS pair.
For an equally co-expressed S/AS pair, only one group should be present.
Also, the similarity score, used in the calculation of differential S/AS
pairs, is supposed to be low (0 indicates an AS:S expression ratio of
0.5) and the maximum difference of the highest and lowest AS:S ratio
should be very low as well. For identiﬁcation of equally co-expressed
S/AS pairs, the fold change of overall expression of the S/AS transcripts
between samples needs to be high. Janus generates a score for the co-
expression by calculating the coefﬁcients of variation for the forward and
reverse strand expression and AS:S ratio. The score grows with higher
expression dissimilarities between samples while maintaining a similar
AS:S expression ratio.

Methylation data can be incorporated in the results (list of antisense
events) by specifying a tab-delimited ﬁle with methylation data (see docu-
mentation for ﬁle formats). With these data, Janus can generate an add-
itional ﬁle for the AS:S ratio in 100 bp, 500 bp, 2.5 kb and 10kb range of
the given site of methylation (Supplementary Fig. S4).

S/AS pairs that might derive exclusively from either homolog, i.e. one
transcript is transcribed from the maternal chromosome while the anti-
sense transcript is transcribed from the paternal chromosome, can be
investigated based on a list of SNVs or without prior SNV information.

tab-delimited ﬁles that are then used by Janus (see documentation for
ﬁle formats). For all SNV positions located within detected S/AS events,
Janus counts the number of reads for each allele, which might be evenly
distributed on both strands or prefer one strand for the sense and anti-
sense transcript each (Supplementary Fig. SS), and calculates a P-value
based on Fisher’s exact test for a 2 x 2 contingency table (ﬁrst, second
strand and allele A, B). Only SNVs are considered for this analysis. Read
counts for all SNV loci that show at least one allele, without requiring
reads on both strands, will be reported and a warning will be displayed at
the end of each entry if the ‘inferred’ (=dominant allele per strand)
alleles differ from the alleles speciﬁed in the SNV ﬁle. This type of ana-
lysis can be used to identify genes where one haplotype is preferentially
expressed, possibly in a strand-speciﬁc manner, which can be a sign of
regulatory variation in cis. However, Janus was not speciﬁcally designed
to detect monoallelic expression. Without a speciﬁed SNV list, Janus will
investigate all positions covered by TARs and search for allele differences
between the two strands. By this method, only loci that are covered by
forward and reverse reads showing two distinct alleles will be reported
and Fisher’s exact test will be applied using the dominant allele from each
strand.

3 RESULTS

Simulated data have been used to assess the performance of
Janus (see Supplementary Material for generation of simulated
data). Using a coverage threshold of 3 per base for the detection
of antisense events, ~84.59% of simulated AS events were de-
tected with exact start and end position (Supplementary Fig. S6).
An additional 3.26% of simulated AS events were detected with
exact start or end position and 12.15% did not match any of the
simulated ends exactly. However, these 12.15% include AS
events that are within simulated AS events but do not fit the
simulated start and end exactly. Also, some AS events were gen-
erated with less than three coverage per base, and thus will not be

detected. Therefore, the 85% given above is a conservative
estimation.

Additionally, we estimated the effect of different parameters
on the detection of AS events by Janus (Supplementary Fig. S7).
The most important filter in the simulated dataset is the coverage
per base threshold. Using a higher coverage threshold effectively
reduces the number of false-positive antisense events. However, it
also removes lowly covered true-positive events. Using a length
cutoff and using the noise ﬁlter had only limited consequences on
the detection of simulated antisense events. This is partially due
to the minimum length requirement during simulation that is at
least two times the read length for sense transcripts and 300 bp
for the antisense transcripts. Also, besides mismapped reads, no
additional noise was added by the simulation. Therefore, the
effect of these parameters will be bigger in real datasets.

Janus performance to identify S/AS transcript pairs with allelic
imbalance was also assessed using simulated data (see
Supplementary Material for data generation). Data were only
simulated for chromosome 1, which resulted in 59 transcript
pairs that shared overlapping regions (Supplementary Table
$1). In these regions, SNVs were introduced with varying num-
bers of alternative allele reads, resulting in 11 transcript pairs
that showed a different major allele [‘Valid’ allelic imbalance
events (AIE)]. Janus identiﬁed a total of 46 AIE including 8
‘Valid’ simulated AIE. The remaining 3 valid AIE were generated
with low numbers of alternative alleles (2, 1 and 1 for the AS
transcript, respectively), which were not detected owing to map-
ping problems. Twenty-two of the AIE detected by Janus showed
a P—Value below 0.05, including six of the ‘Valid’ AIE. Of the
remaining 16 AIE, 15 can be traced back to mapping problems
close to splice junctions (Supplementary Fig. S8), where reads
containing only one to ﬁve bases of the neighboring exons are
mapped partially into the intron. The remaining false-positive
AIE with P—Value below 0.05 is caused by other types of mis-
mapping. Although Janus identiﬁes most of the simulated AIE, it
is important to consider the results with care, as mismapping
(especially close to splice-junctions) can easily lead to a false-
positive AIE detection.

SOLiD RNAseq data from real experiments (see next section
for more details about this data) was mapped using different
tools to assess the effect of different mappers on the analysis of
Janus. The Bioscope software of Applied Biosystems performed
best when comparing the number of mapped reads of all map-
pers used (Bioscope, BWA, Bowtie/TopHat) (Supplementary
Fig. 89a). The number of identiﬁed antisense events is highly
dependent on the number of mapped sequences, and thus the
data mapped with Bioscope yields more antisense events
(Supplementary Fig. 89b). The run time of Janus shows an
almost linear increase with higher read numbers
(Supplementary Fig. 890), and the overlap of detected antisense
events from the different mappings shows that there is almost
complete overlap between different Bioscope mappings, but far
less overlap with the other two mappers (Supplementary Fig.
S9d). Therefore, the Bioscope software seems to work best for
the investigated color-space libraries.

Janus has been applied to transcriptome sequence data gener-
ated from transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) of ﬁve
individuals included in the 1000 Genomes project (2010), which
have been sequenced on the SOLiD system and on the Illumina

ERR011459]. The reads were mapped against the human th9
reference, and the UCSC knownGenes annotation for th9 was
used. SNV calls from the 1000 Genomes project (pilot release
from 23 November 2010) were used for the allele-speciﬁc expres-
sion analysis. Janus was also applied to SOLiD data from three
classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) cell lines [L-1236, KM-H2
and U-HOl (Mader er al., 2007)], for which also methylation
data based on Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChips
(Illumina, San Diego, USA) was available (Ammerpohl er al.,
2012). These data were mapped against the human hg18 refer-
ence, and the corresponding gene annotation (knownGenes)
from the UCSC was used (see Supplementary Material for map-
ping parameters). Also stranded data f or two different mouse cell
types (small intestine, colon) was investigated (GEO accession
number GSE21746) that has been mapped against the m9 ref-
erence. Duplicates in BAM files were marked using PICARD
tools.

The two technologies [SOLiD WTAK (Klostermeier er al.,
2011) and Illumina GA IIx (Parkhomchuk er al., 2009)] dis-
played different patterns. The Illumina data show a high abun-
dance of antisense tags in exonic regions that follow the introni
exon structure of the sense transcript. We estimated a failure rate
of ~&6% for Illumina GA IIx strand-speciﬁc data and <1%
failure rate for SOLiD WTAK (‘Whole Transcriptome Analysis
Kit’) strand-speciﬁc data (Fig. 5).

To demonstrate the biological impact of Janus, we focused the
following analysis on the SOLiD data, as it exhibits less back-
ground noise. For each sample, a large amount of antisense
events was detected [~10000 events for 3040mi11ion mapped

reads (~44e60 million total reads), Supplementary Table S2]. In
a similar fashion to Figure 2, one example for each S/AS class is
presented in Supplementary Figure 810. Many unannotated
transcripts were detected by Janus, one such example is given
in Supplementary Figure SI 1. Antisense transcription occurring
in promoter and terminator regions, here deﬁned as 1 kb before
and after the transcript start and end site, was investigated. Of
32 110 (hg18, cHL data) and 66 065 (hg19, LCL data) annotated
transcripts, an average of 760 promoter and 980 terminator
regions (hg18) and 2100 promoter and 2400 terminator regions
(hg19) showed antisense transcription with a minimum length
of 150 bp and a mean coverage per base of at least five
(Supplementary Table S3). A comparison of identiﬁed antisense
events in promoter and terminator regions for different coverage
limits is shown in Supplementary Figure 812. Considering all
occurring transcription, terminator and promoter regions show
a high abundance of sense tags. By ﬁltering for promoter and
terminator regions, which show an antisense event of a certain
size (here 150bp), the amount of sense tags is dramatically
reduced and the amount of antisense tags increases, which is
not surprising. However, by further filtering for minimum anti-
sense coverage, the amount of antisense tags increases stronger in
the terminator regions relative to the promoter region.

For both sets of human samples (1000 Genomes individuals,
cHL cell lines), we were able to identify S/AS pairs that show
mutually exclusive expression of either transcript. In the LCL,
only one lucid pair (SEPPI/CCDCI52, Supplementary Table S4
and Supplementary Fig. 813) could be identiﬁed. In contrast,
despite being also derived from B-cells, the cHL cell lines
showed multiple such events that could indicate that AS-
mediated gene silencing plays a role in the pathogenesis of
these tumors (Supplementary Table S5 and Supplementary
Figs Sl4eSl6). Supplementary Figure 817 shows tissue-speciﬁc
examples of differentially expressed antisense transcripts in the
investigated mouse libraries.

In the 1000 Genomes samples, several S/AS pairs that show a
positively correlated expression pattern could be detected by
the default parameters of the program (Supplementary Table
S6 and Supplementary Figs $187824). Three examples for
S/AS pairs that correlate in expression in the cHL dataset are
shown in Supplementary Figures S2&S27. Supplementary
Figure S28 illustrates an example of a tissue-speciﬁc co—expressed
S/AS pair in the investigated mouse libraries. One probably false-
positive example of a positive correlated S/AS pair is shown in
Supplementary Figure S29, the pair is occurring in a repeat
region and has roughly the same size and shape on both strands,
and thus it is unlikely to be real expression on both strands.
The repeat region shows strong expression in the L-1236
dataset but not in the other samples. Interestingly, it has been
shown that derepression of a terminal repeat can lead to
the activation of a proto-oncogene in human lymphoma
(Lamprecht er al., 2010).

One case with a slight correlation of CpG methylation degree
and differential expression of S/AS pairs was detected in the cHL
data (Supplementary Fig. 816). The mean methylation beta
values at two distinct locations near the ZSCAN16 promoter
range from 0.02 to 0.15 for L-1236 and U-HOl and 0.45 to
0.54 in KM-H2 (Supplementary Table S7). Expression of a

short antisense transcript occurs only in KM-H2, while the
sense transcript is only expressed in the other two cell lines.

Allele-speciﬁc expression data of known SNVs did not show
any S/AS pairs with both transcripts expressed from different
homologs exclusively. However, we identiﬁed some cases of al-
lelic imbalance between the transcripts on the ﬁrst and second
strand (Supplementary Figs S30 and S31). The first example
shows expression of NCAPHZ and SCOZ. While most reads
corresponding to NCAPHZ expression show the G allele and
only few show the T allele, the opposite was found for reads
corresponding to SCOZ expression. The second example shows
expression of FAN] and MTMRIO. Reads corresponding to
FAN] expression show both SNV alleles (T/C), while the reads
corresponding to M TMRIO expression show the C allele only.
Janus also identified several SNVs (in the approach without a
priori knowledge of SNV positions) where both alleles are exclu-
sively expressed on either strand. Supplementary Figure S32
shows one such example. The region transcribed in antisense
direction is overlapping a VEGA annotated pseudogene, over-
laps partially a non-repeat masked duplication and the identiﬁed
SNVs are not included in the well characterized SNV list of the
1000 Genomes project, and thus this example represents likely a
false positive.

4 DISCUSSION

Evidence is growing that antisense transcription is not random
and unspeciﬁc transcription of the genome, but an essential and
complex component of the even more complex transcription ma-
chinery. Here we present a tool, Janus, to characterize strand-
speciﬁc transcription from high-throughput sequencing data,
and applied it to several real datasets. First, we used Janus to
detect differences between the two investigated next-generation
technologies. The data derived using the Illumina GA IIx shows
a noisy background that is probably caused by imperfect library
generation (i.e. not all reads preserved the correct strand). This
gives a good explanation for the high antisense tag density in
exonic regions observed by He er al., who used the Illumina GA,
which could not be conﬁrmed by Klevebring er al., who used the
SOLiD system (He er al., 2008; Klevebring er al., 2010). It can
thus be assumed that some of the differences between the two
studies result from the obvious technical bias (background noise)
of the two sequencing protocols. This underlines the importance
to assess the ‘noise’ level, i.e. the error rate of the library prep-
aration, before identifying antisense events. Knowing the higher
level of background noise of the Illumina protocol, we used only
the SOLiD data for further analysis. Janus performs well in de-
tecting antisense events, and many of the identiﬁed events are
still not annotated. However, it must be kept in mind that neigh-
boring antisense events reported by Janus are often derived from
the same transcript and do not represent independent results.
Currently, Janus does not make use of pairing information or
split reads, which could be used to link multiple AS events and
improve the result list. Previous publications mention a high
abundance of antisense tags both in the promoter and terminator
regions of genes (He et al., 2008; Katayama er al., 2005;
Layer and Weil, 2009). We used Janus to investigate the
amount of sense and antisense transcription occurring in 1kb
up- and downstream annotated transcripts. Interestingly, when

considering antisense events with low coverage in the promoter
and terminator regions, the amount of antisense tags in promoter
regions is higher than in terminator regions, while this shifts to-
ward more antisense tags in terminator regions when considering
only higher covered antisense events. This could be caused by a
higher mismapping in promoter regions, maybe due to conserved
motifs of transcription factor binding sites and TATA-like
sequences, which generates a higher noise level. Another explan-
ation is that there is more low-level antisense transcription occur-
ring in promoter regions and stronger antisense transcription in
terminator regions. Also, it is possible that S /AS pairs in head-to-
head conformation show lower expression than S/AS pairs in
tail-to-tail conformation.

Among the huge amount of detected S/AS pairs, there are
some pairs that show mutually exclusive expression of one
strand in some samples, and expression of the other strand in
others. The low number of these S/AS pairs suggests that they
are rare events in the population and/or affect only a small pro-
portion of transcripts. It remains unclear if there is an inhibitory
effect of one transcript on its counterpart or if other mechanisms
such as epigenetic modiﬁcations are involved, as has been shown
for the highly imprinted gnas locus in mice (Holmes et al., 2003).
We could identify several S/AS pairs that are co-expressed and
show an equal expression rate of both transcripts, but differ in
expression between samples. It could be argued this is caused by
different library performance (i.e. this region was just unlucky in
some samples) or a coverage bias might persist despite normal-
izing for the total coverage per sample. However, as shown in
Supplementary Figure 818, GLBI shows a similar expression
rate in all samples, while TRIM 7] and the unknown antisense
event show a positively correlated expression, which differs be-
tween samples. It is unlikely that the observed co-expression is
due to coverage effects. Katayama et a]. (2005) suggested that
long non-coding RNAs might be involved in S/AS pairs,
reasoned by a higher number of S/AS pairs detected by
random primed Cap-Analysis-Gene-Expression (CAGE) com-
pared with oligo-dT primed CAGE. It could be speculated that
the identiﬁed AS event upstream of TRIM 7] might present such
a non-coding RNA, as no exoniintron structure is Visible.
Interestingly, in the same article, Katayama et a]. reported a
frequent concordant regulation of S/AS pairs. Another study
by Watanabe et a]. (2010) provides further evidence of a high
occurrence of positively correlated S/AS pairs. The reason for
this remains unclear, but it could be due to the fact that tran-
scription of one strand makes the other strand more accessible as
well. Linked to this, palindromic sequences in regulatory regions,
such as promoter regions, might be used by both strands. In this
case, the observed transcript could be nonsense transcription,
which ends by the ﬁrst possible encountered transcription end
signal. This might explain why antisense transcripts in promoter
regions are often described as short and long non-coding RNAs.
However, it is not unlikely that these antisense transcripts have
some function, as they do not occur in all promoter or termin-
ator regions of every expressed gene. Multiple studies showed
that non-coding RNAs might alter chromatin conformation or
lead to a local change of methylation if they are located within
promoter regions (Guttman and Rinn, 2012; Imamura et al.,
2004; Murrell et al., 2004).

Using the data available to us, we could not link sense and
antisense transcription to methylation of CpG islands, except
weakly for one case, which might be coincidental. It is possible
that the limited number of CpG islands interrogated by the chip
(27 K) prevented identiﬁcation of CpG methylation conditional
antisense expression. A larger dataset or data based on histone
modiﬁcation might lead to new results, as a link to histone
methylation has been shown before, i.e. in the case of the p21
antisense transcript. By investigating known SNV positions (gen-
erated by the 1000 Genomes Consortium), we were able to iden-
tify some SNVs showing signs of strand-speciﬁc allelic
imbalance. Janus also identiﬁes S/AS-specific allelic imbalance
for positions that are not known to be SNV positions. Yet,
most of these positions can be traced back to regions that are
difﬁcult to map to (i.e. human leukocyte antigen), repeat regions,
pseudogenes and genes with multiple copies, and thus these re-
sults have to be considered with care.

While we have used independent, but highly similar, samples
(lymphoma cell lines and lymphoblastoid cells and two different
intestinal tissues) under steady-state conditions for development
of the tool, it must be emphasized that detection of context-
dependent regulation of S/AS transcription will require an
appropriate number of biological replicates to filter away biolo-
gical noise of a dynamic system.

With Janus we provide a useful tool for researchers to identify
S/AS pairs within transcriptomes based on data of next-
generation sequencing. While it remains difﬁcult to identify
differences between samples, Janus identiﬁes S/AS pairs
efﬁciently and may help to identify interesting S/AS pairs in
disease-relevant data.

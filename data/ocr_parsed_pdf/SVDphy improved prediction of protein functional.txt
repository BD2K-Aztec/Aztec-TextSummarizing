Abstract

Summary: A successful approach for predicting functional associations between non—homologous
genes is to compare their phylogenetic distributions. We have devised a phylogenetic profiling al—
gorithm, SVD—Phy, which uses truncated singular value decomposition to address the problem of
uninformative profiles giving rise to false positive predictions. Benchmarking the algorithm against
the KEGG pathway database, we found that it has substantially improved performance over exist—

ing phylogenetic profiling methods.

1 Introduction

Phylogenetic proﬁling methods are able to predict functional inter—
actions between genes that encode proteins from the same complex or
pathway, by comparing their phylogenetic distributions (Cheng and
Perocchi, 2015; Date and Marcotte, 2003; Enault et (11., 2003; Li et (11.,
2014; Pellegrini et (11., 1999; Tabach et (11., 2013a). The underlying
idea is that when two genes are functionally related, they should
tend to be co—inherited; since the loss of either one of these genes would
be detrimental to that particular function. Here we present a new
phylogenetic profiling method, SVD—Phy, which performs considerably
better than existing methods for both bacteria and eukaryotes.

number of other organisms. Speciﬁcally we construct a matrix with
the alignment bit scores of the best scoring match for each query pro—
tein (rows) in each organism (columns), including the organism itself.
We obtain the bit scores from SIMAP (Arnold et (11., 2014) via the
homology table of STRING V10 (Szklarczyk et (11., 2015), but bit
scores from BLAST can also be used. If a query protein gives no hits
in a certain organism with a bit score of at least 60, the bit score is set
to 0; using higher cutoffs reduced the performance (Supplementary
Fig. S1). We convert this matrix to a normalized best bit matrix M by
dividing each bit score by the largest score in the same row (typically
the self—hit).

Similar to earlier work on phylogenetic stratification
(Psomopoulos et (11., 2013), we then perform truncated singular
value decomposition (SVD) of M by calculating the factorization
M:USV’ and retaining only the first C columns from the resulting
unitary matrix U. Different values of C were tested for each organ—
ism (Supplementary Figs S2—S5). We finally normalize each row in

the matrix to unit vectors and calculate all pairwise Euclidean dis—
tances between them. Other similarity metrics gave similar or worse
performance (Supplementary Figs S6—S10). See supplementary
material for further details.

3 Benchmarking and comparison

We tested the algorithm on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic pro—
teins and compared its performance against a simplified algorithm
lacking the truncated SVD step and against two established algo—
rithms (Date and Marcotte, 2003; Tabach et al., 2013a,b). For all
four algorithms, we generated ranked lists of predicted associations
based on phylogenetic profiles across all 1793 prokaryotes and 238
eukaryotes in STRING v10 for prokaryotic and eukaryotic query
proteins, respectively. We benchmarked the predicted associations
against the KEGG pathway database (Kanehisa et al., 2014).

Given a ranked list of predicted function associations, we evalu—
ate the performance as follows. We first discard all pairs with bit
score 260, as homologous proteins will trivially have similar phylo—
genetic profiles and are often involved in the same KEGG pathway.
We next map all proteins to KEGG genes and discard pairs where
one or both proteins cannot be placed on a KEGG map. The remain—
ing pairs are considered true positives (TP) if the two proteins fall
within the same KEGG map and otherwise false positives (FP). To
ensure that the results were not biased by certain atypical KEGG
maps (Supplementary Table S1), we repeated all analysis excluding
these maps. We also benchmarked the predicted associations for
E.coli and H.sapiens using EcoCyc (Keseler et al., 2013) and
Reactome (Croft et al., 2014), respectively.

In all benchmarks, SVD—Phy showed dramatically improved per—
formance over the other three algorithms, including the simplified
algorithm that differs only by leaving out the truncated SVD step
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs S6—S10). When benchmarked on
Saccloaromyces cerevisiae, SVD—Phy also outperformed the CLIME
method (Li et al., 2014) (Supplementary Fig S11). For example, SVD—
Phy predicts over 14—fold more associations at 75% precision than
other methods on Escherichia coli, an organism on which all algo—
rithms generally perform well. When not restricting associations to
proteins that can be mapped to KEGG, we predict 14 078 interactions
in E.coli and 4090 in H.sapiens at 75 % precision. This corresponds
to an average interaction degree of 7.2 and 0.4, respectively.

The benchmarks also revealed that all algorithms performed
considerably worse on eukaryotes than on prokaryotes. To test
whether this was purely due to the smaller number of eukaryotic or—
ganisms used to build the phylogenetic profiles, we repeated the ana—
lyses using profiles based on only 238 prokaryotes (Supplementary
Figs SSB and S713). Although this did lead to an expected decrease in
performance, all algorithms continued to perform notably better on
prokaryotes than on eukaryotes.

4 Discussion

We have shown that SVD—Phy has better predictive power than
existing phylogenetic profiling algorithms. This improvement was
achieved by performing truncated SVD on the profiles before calcu—
lating their similarities. An intuitive explanation of this transform—
ation is that it collapses phylogenetic profiles that are shared by
many proteins into fewer dimensions (principal components). This
reduces noise (Psomopoulos et al., 2013) and increases the diversity
of the resulting profiles, which was recently shown to be beneficial
(Skunca and Dessimoz, 2015). The benefit is that it prevents high

similarity scores between uninformative profiles that can be trivially
explained by simple vertical inheritance of genes along the taxo—
nomic tree, or by broad similarities in the lifestyles of the organisms.
This includes highly similar profiles caused by the inclusion of mul—
tiple strains of a species, clade—specific proteins and enzymes that
have been lost in most parasites (because they instead import metab—
olites from their hosts).

We fully integrated our protein—protein interaction predictions
with the STRING database (Szklarczyk et al., 2015) (Supplementary
Figs S12—S13). The data can be browsed online and is freely avail—
able for download in tab—delimited format. SVD—Phy executes very
fast: its run time is on average about 10—20 min per organism on a
normal workstation. This allows us to execute the algorithm for all
2031 species in the STRING database, and makes it possible for
others to utilize the algorithm within their web resources.

In a recent study, Tabach et al. (2013b) successfully used their
method to shed light on several disease pathways. Phylogenetic
profiling algorithms have also been applied to analyze non—coding
elements (NCEs), such as small RNAs (Ott et al., 2012; Tabach
et al., 2013a), showing that phylogenetic profiling is indeed an im—
portant technique that can be used to shed light even on NCE func—
tions and interactions (Dimitrieva and Bucher, 2012).

Abstract

Motivation: Polyadenylation is an essential process during eukaryotic gene expression. Prediction
of poly(A) sites helps to define the 3’ end of genes, which is important for gene annotation and elu—
cidating gene regulation mechanisms. However, due to limited knowledge of poly(A) signals, it is
still challenging to predict poly(A) sites in plants and algae. PASPA is a web server for poly(A) §ite
prediction in plants and algae, which integrates many in—house tools as add—ons to facilitate
poly(A) site prediction, visualization and mining. This server can predict poly(A) sites for ten spe—
cies, including seven previously poly(A) signal non—characterized species, with sensitivity and spe—

cificity in a range between 0.80 and 0.95.

1 Introduction

Polyadenylation is one of the essential processes and a point of regu—
lation for eukaryotic gene expression. This process involves the
cleavage at the 3’end of pre—messenger RNA (pre—mRNA) and the
addition of a poly(A) tail. A poly(A) site marks the end of a gene,
the recognition of which is important to fully understand the func—
tions of genes and to accurately annotate the genomes. Given the
connection between polyadenylation and transcription termination,
correct identification of poly(A) sites would also predict where
transcription termination may occur. Moreover, alternative polya—
denylation, the use of different poly(A) sites of a gene, has been
recognized as an important gene expression regulator in eukaryotes.

A number of computational tools based on support vector ma—
chine or discriminant analysis have been developed to predict
poly(A) sites or poly(A) signals in human, including Erpin
(Gautheret and Lambert, 2001), POLYAR (Akhtar et (11., 2010),

Dragon PolyA Spotter (Kalkatawi et (11., 2012), etc. Unlike human
or animals where the dominant signal AAUAAA is found in >5 0%
of poly(A) sites (Tian and Graber, 2012), no highly conserved
poly(A) signal can be found in plants or algae (Xing and Li, 2011),
there are subsequently fewer prediction models available. Our group
developed a poly(A) site prediction tool called Poly(A) Site Sleuth
(PASS) (Ji et (11., 2007) based on a generalized hidden Markov model
(GHMM). PASS and its modified version have been applied on the
poly(A) site prediction for Arabidopsis (Ji et (11., 2007) and rice
(Shen et (11., 2008), respectively. Another classification based model
called poly(A) site classifier (PAC) was developed for green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Wu et (11., 2012). Tzanis et al. (2011)
also developed a classification—based command—line tool called
polyA—iEP to predict poly(A) sites in Arabidopsis.

To our knowledge, most of the aforementioned tools were imple—
mented as standalone programs with command—line interfaces,

which limit their use among biologists. For example, PASS and PAC
are Windows application tools and cannot run in other operation
systems (OS). PolyA—iEP is a command—line tool specific to
Arabidopsis. Here, we create the first open—access public web service
for poly(A) site prediction in plants and algae (PASPA), integrating
many in—house tools as add—ons to facilitate data visualization and
mining. Our server covers 10 species, including rice, Arabidopsis,
and Medicago truncatula, spikemoss Selaginella moellendorfﬂi,
moss Physcomitrella patens, red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae, two
green algae Creinhardtii and Ostreococcus lucimarinus, and two
diatoms Thalassiosira pseudomma and Phaeodactylum tricornutum.
Seven of these species are previously non—characterized in terms of
their poly(A) signals and poly(A) sites.

2 Methods

2.1 Algorithm updates

PASS 2.0 is the core prediction program to predict poly(A) sites,
which is based on the GHMM prediction model. An updated ver—
sion of PASS with the following improvements is used. First, PASS is
a Windows application tool implemented in Delphi language, limit—
ing its use in command prompt or other OSes like Linux. Coded in
C++, PASS 2.0 is executable in different OSes, as well as in com—
mand line. Second, the parameters for GHMM structure in PASS
are fixed, e.g. the number of signal states, and therefore its param—
eters cannot be modified for other species whose poly(A) signals and
number of signal states are different. In contrast, PASS 2.0 allows
adjustment of the model parameters, such as length of each state,
state type, and number of states, according to the characteristics of
the surrounding sequences of target species to adapt to the respective
poly(A) site profiles. Third, PASS 2.0 offers several probability cal—
culation methods to calculate the state output probability of the
GHMM structure, such as heterogeneous first—order Markov sub—
model and weights of signal patterns and their combination.
Moreover, users can train their own GHMM parameter file for the
prediction of poly(A) sites in a new species. Several Perl scripts are
provided to facilitate better estimation of model parameters for any
given species (described in Supplementary Section S1). Additionally,
a different method is implemented to locate the exact positions of
predicted poly(A) sites in PASS 2.0 rather than the approximate
regions in PASS (described in Supplementary Section S2). We have
trained our GHMM profiles for ten species and will continue to
expand this list in the future when new poly(A) site data become
available. However, if the species the user desired is not listed, simi—
lar species in the list can be chosen or our program can automatic—
ally choose the optimal model parameters according to the given
sequence file.

2.2 PASPA server

PASPA is a web—based service consisting of a series of Perl scripts, a
PHP web application, and PASS 2.0 for poly(A) site prediction,
evaluation, and visualization. The input data for our server are a
DNA sequence file in FASTA format, with the optional files for
known poly(A) sites or model parameters. The output is the poly(A)
site(s) predicted along the original target sequences, based on the
poly(A) scores. The result pages contain three viewers (described in
Supplementary Section S3). The first one is the list viewer in which
the prediction results will be shown in a tabulated list. Users may
also choose to visualize single nucleotide base compositions and
poly(A) signals of the input sequences. The second one is the score
viewer (Fig. 1a) in which all predicted and known poly(A) sites (if

given sequence for visualization. With functions such as motif
search, users can identify canonical poly(A) signals (e.g., AAUAAA
or UGUAA) and their variants in the pattern viewer. The third
viewer (Fig. 1b) is the EST—polyA viewer in which the input se—
quences are aligned to the genome to associate any authenticated
polyadenylation evidence. There are four authentic poly(A) site
datasets from whole—genome studies currently available, including
Arabidopsis, rice, M.truncatula, and Creinhardtii (Shen et (11.,
2008; Wu et (11., 2011, 2014; Zhao et (11., 2014). Users can search
known poly(A) sites in the vicinity of their aligned sequences and
visualize both known sites and predicted ones along the genome.
More details about the server implementation are described in
Supplementary Section S3.

3 Results

For prediction purposes, the positive data set was generated from
poly(A) sites in 3’ untranslated regions (3’—UTRs). Random sequences
and sequences from 5’—UTRs or coding sequences were used as con—
trol datasets (described in Supplementary Section S4). Part of the se—
quences in the known poly(A) site datasets were randomly selected
for model training. Part of the rest of the sequences from the positive
ploy(A) datasets and the control datasets were used to estimate sensi—
tivity (SN) and specificity (SP) (described in Supplementary Section
S4). Similar to previous studies (Ji et (11., 2007; Shen et (11., 2008), a
compromise between SN and SP was used to evaluate the model per—
formance. Additional indexes including Matthew’s correlation coeffi—
cient, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, F—
measure were also employed for a more comprehensive evaluation of
the performance. Cross value of SN and SP ranges from 0.80 to 0.95
(Table 1). The variation of performance among different species may
due to the distinct set of poly(A) signals used in the respective species.
In addition, compared with previous prediction tool, PASS for
Arabidopsis and rice (Ji et (11., 2007; Shen et (11., 2008), PASPA
obtains higher performance with better ﬂexibility. More details about
the model evaluation are given in Supplementary Section S5.

4 Conclusions

PASPA is the first web server for the prediction and visualization of
poly(A) sites in plants and algae, with high prediction performance
and good ﬂexibility. It will be a valuable addition to the community
for the study of polyadenylation, genome annotation, transcription,
and gene expression.

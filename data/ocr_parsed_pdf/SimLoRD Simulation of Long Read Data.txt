Abstract

Motivation: Third generation sequencing methods provide longer reads than second generation
methods and have distinct error characteristics. While there exist many read simulators for second
generation data, there is a very limited choice forthird generation data.

Results: We analyzed public data from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) SMRT sequencing, developed
an error model and implemented it in a new read simulator called SimLoRD. It offers options to
choose the read length distribution and to model error probabilities depending on the number of
passes through the sequencer. The new error model makes SimLoRD the most realistic SMRT read

simulator available.

Availability and Implementation: SimLoRD is available open source at http://bitbucket.org/
genomeinformatics/simlord/and installable via Bioconda (http://bioconda.github.io).

1 Introduction

Third generation sequencing technologies like SMRT (single molecule
real time) sequencing are increasingly used because they yield consid-
erably longer reads than second generation methods. The error char-
acteristics of SMRT are fundamentally different from previous
technologies: The basic error rates are higher (10—15%), but errors
are considered unbiased and uniformly distributed (Eid et (11., 2009),
which means that they can be reduced by sequencing a molecule sev-
eral times. As more bioinformatics applications are developed for se-
quence analysis tasks from SMRT data or hybrid data, e.g. genome
assembly, SNP calling, structural variant discovery, authors of such
tools will benefit from read simulators that take into account the spe-
cifics of the SMRT technology. The existing manifold simulators for
second generation technologies, such as ART for 454, Illumina and
SOLiD reads (Huang et (11., 2012), do not do this.

There are few simulators designed for SMRT reads, e.g. PBSIM
(Ono et (11., 2013), FASTQSim (Shcherbina, 2014) and Alchemy from
the BLASR package (Chaisson and Tesler, 2012), the latter now being
deprecated along with the .bas.h5 format. PBSIM’s defaults are based
on now outdated chemistry and cannot be completely re-configured.
Even if the read length is adapted, the conditional read quality

distribution does not match well existing data (Fig. 1 and
Supplement). Also, PBSIM does not provide SAM-formatted align-
ments between the reference and the simulated reads. FASTQSim is a
general-purpose tool for both read analysis and simulation. In particu-
lar, it provides pre-set parameters for SMRT simulation, but also
allows to analyze an existing dataset with regard to its properties and
simulate accordingly. However, it is unable to provide mapping infor-
mation or alignments of simulated reads and it simulates reads rather
slowly (8700 N. crassrz reads with 30 cores took 90 min). The simu-
lated length/quality distributions do not agree well with data (Fig. 1
and Supplement), and it is difficult to change parameters directly.

To improve upon the existing solutions, we developed a new
read simulator called ‘SimLoRD — Simulation of Long Read Data’
that is convenient to use and easily re-configured when technical
specifications change. The default values provide realistic simulation
results according to the current state of the SMRT technology
(March 2016); see Figure 1.

To conclude, we have presented a Python—based read simulator
(SimLoRD) whose error model corresponds to third—generation
SMRT error characteristics, with default parameters based on public
datasets. Relevant parameters are easily adjustable via command
line arguments, so the simulator can be quickly adapted to new
chemistries as they are developed. SimLoRD is convenient to install
with standard Python tools and runs on all standard platforms. We
hope that many researchers will benefit from the ability to generate
simulated SMRT data when developing novel analysis applications.

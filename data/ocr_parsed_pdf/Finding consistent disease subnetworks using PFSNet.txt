ABSTRACT

Motivation: Microarray data analysis is often applied to characterize
disease populations by identifying individual genes linked to the dis-
ease. In recent years, efforts have shifted to focus on sets of genes
known to perform related biological functions (i.e. in the same path-
ways). Evaluating gene sets reduces the need to correct for false posi-
tives in multiple hypothesis testing. However, pathways are often
large, and genes in the same pathway that do not contribute to the
disease can cause a method to miss the pathway. In addition, large
pathways may not give much insight to the cause of the disease.
Moreover, when such a method is applied independently to two data-
sets of the same disease phenotypes, the two resulting lists of signifi-
cant pathways often have low agreement.

Results: We present a powerful method, PFSNet, that identiﬁes smal-
ler parts of pathways (which we call subnetworks), and show that
significant subnetworks (and the genes therein) discovered by
PFSNet are up to 51% (64%) more consistent across independent
datasets of the same disease phenotypes, even for datasets based
on different platforms, than previously published methods. We further
show that those methods which initially declared some large pathways
to be insignificant would declare subnetworks detected by PFSNet in
those large pathways to be significant, if they were given those sub-
networks as input instead of the entire large pathways.

1 INTRODUCTION

Discovering the mechanisms regulating a disease requires re-
searchers to understand the cascade of events leading to a par-
ticular phenotype. These mechanisms are often depicted in
biological pathways in the literature. While microarray technology
provides researchers a glimpse of the underlying characteristics
that differentiate phenotypes%.g. normal samples versus dis-
eased samplesiit has been shown that methods for microarray
analysis often produce results that are inconsistent and unrepro-
ducible when applied independently on independent datasets
(Zhang et al., 2009) and, in some cases, are even no better than
randomly produced gene signatures (V enet et al., 2011).

Clearly, a method that produces a higher agreement between
two datasets of the same disease lends more conﬁdence to the
real cause of the disease. SNet (Soh et al., 2011) is one of the rare

exceptions in gene-expression—analysis methods that produce
pathways and genes that are consistently signiﬁcant when inde-
pendently applied to multiple independent datasets of the same
disease phenotypes, even when these datasets are not restricted to
the same platform. The percentage of agreement is higher than
other methods compared.

In this article, we identify some shortcomings of SNet, and
present two reﬁnements which we incorporate in the new
method PFSNet. We have tested PFSNet on six datasets from
three disease types. Our method produces an improvement of
25764% and 31751% in gene agreement and pathway agree-
ment, respectively, when compared to SNet, and even more
when compared to earlier methods like GSEA, GGEA, SAM
and t-test.

2 BACKGROUND

In the past decade and a half, many microarray analysis
approaches have been proposed to identify genes whose expres-
sion profile is useful for the diagnosis of a disease, the prognosis
of a treatment or deciphering the cause of a disease. These genes
are usually differentially expressed between the disease pheno-
types and normal tissues. Using statistics to identify differentially
expressed genes is one of the earliest and still popular methods.
For example, the t-test identiﬁes individual genes whose mean
expression value is higher in one class of samples than the other.
The problem with using any statistical test is that performing the
same hypothesis test multiple times results in a large number of
false positives. For example, if the cut-off threshold for statistical
signiﬁcance is 0.05, then performing the test on 30 000 genes
results in 1500 expected false positives. This leads to a number
of works that correct the P—Values (Tusher et al., 2001).

For several years now, there has been a paradigm shift from
looking at individual genes to gene sets. Such methods avoid
large multiple-hypothesis testing by preselecting gene sets using
biological knowledge. These gene sets are often termed ‘path-
ways’ in the literature, and are groups of genes that perform a
speciﬁc function. These methods can be classiﬁed into four cate-
gories, described in separate sections below.

2.1 Overlap analysis

Overlap analysis methods (Khatri and Draghici, 2005) test
whether the proportion of genes over-expressed in one phenotype
in a pathway is different from the proportion in the whole array.
This is usually done using the hyper-geometric test with the null
hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportions of
differentially expressed genes in the pathway compared to a
random gene set.

The drawback of overlap-based methods is that differentially
expressed genes may be caused by genes that are not themselves
differentially expressed. For example, a gene may have a muta-
tion that does not affect its expression level but affects the shape
of its protein product and, thus, the ability of the protein product
to interact with its down-stream partners. Such a causal gene has
the ability to effect a change in many differentially expressed
genes. The biological explanation usually implicates the causal
gene, which by Virtue of not being itself differentially expressed,
is not detected by single-gene-based methods and often also over-
lap analysis methods. Moreover, the threshold applied to decide
whether a gene is differentially expressed is arbitrarily chosen.
This can have a large effect on the set of differentially expressed
genes, hence causing a large impact on the hyper-geometric test
(Fig. lb).

2.2 Direct-group analysis

Direct-group methods like GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005) and
FCS (Goeman et al., 2004) use a suitable statistical test on the
whole pathway instead of preselecting differentially expressed
genes. These methods circumvent the problems of overlap meth-
ods mentioned previously and are usually less sensitive to arbi-
trary changes (due to different threshold values) in the number of
genes which are differentially expressed.

Fig. 1. Methods that rely on gene sets are categorized into three groups.
(a) The differentially expressed genes (darker shade; red, see online), and
genes with no expression difference (lighter shade; green, see online).
Overlap analysis methods compute the statistical signiﬁcance of whether
differentially expressed genes are more likely to exist in a pathway or in a
random set of genes. (b) A different threshold is used to select differen-
tially expressed genes, this difference is large enough for overlap analysis
methods to miss the pathway, whereas direct-group methods are less
sensitive to such changes. (0) A large number of non-causal genes con-
taminates the score in direct-group methods, whereas network-based
methods restrict themselves to smaller parts of the affected pathway
(lighter shade; yellow, see online) and are still able to detect them.
Some network-based methods, which look around a small neighborhood
of regulatory elements, produce subnetworks that do not sufﬁciently
explain the biological cause of the disease. ((1) In contrast, the explanation
usually involves a cascade of genes whose upstream genes exert an effect
on downstream genes

 

GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005) computes a Kolmogorovi
Smirnov—like statistic and FCS (Goeman et al., 2004) computes a
Mean-LogP statistic for each pathway to determine its statistical
significance. The significant pathways hence have genes overre-
presented in one phenotype but not the other.

The problem with approaches in this category is that when the
pathway contains too many non-causal genes, the statistical
score can be largely affected. It is likely that these methods iden-
tify pathways that contain sufﬁciently large proportion of
disease-related genes but pathways that contain only a few
disease-related genes can be missed out (Fig. 1c).

2.3 Network-based analysis

In order to address the problems that arise from direct-group
analysis, network-based methods identify a subset of genes that
might be most relevant to a phenotype in each pathway. This
breaks up the pathway into smaller parts, which we call ‘subnet-
works’ in this article. Methods in this category include NEA
(Sivachenko et al., 2007) and SNet (Soh et al., 2011).

In NEA (Sivachenko et al., 2007), the subnetworks are con-
structed based on the immediate neighborhood around each
regulatory element. Each subnetwork is then tested for signiﬁ-
cance using, e.g. statistical methods mentioned in the direct-
group analysis approaches. The problem is that the results
usually only provides a partial explanation to the cause of dis-
ease. In contrast, diseases are usually explained by a cascade of
genes whose upstream genes exert an effect on downstream ones
(Fig. Id).

In a recent publication, another network-based method, SNet
(Soh et al., 2011), has the capability to extract meaningful sub-
networks, which are not necessarily restricted to a small neigh-
borhood around some genes. The subnetworks in SNet are
generated by setting a threshold on the gene expression levels.
The authors ﬁrst selected the top (1% genes in one phenotype.
From this set of genes, they used majority voting to select genes
that occur in at least )3% of the given phenotype (by default
a = 10% and )3 = 5%). In each pathway, genes not in the selected
list are removed, causing the pathway to fragment into smaller
pieces. The pieces exceeding a certain size are considered candi-
date subnetworks for subsequent signiﬁcance analysis (Fig. 2).

One practical consideration when using SNet is the choice of
the thresholds. In their article, a and )3 thresholds are set at 10%

and 50%, respectively. The shortcoming of SNet is that genes
that lie only slightly below the top (1% can get missed out be-
cause they occur in less than )3% of the samples. One might
attempt to increase (1% threshold but many false positives
would be included. In order to address this shortcoming, we
propose fuzzification on the gene-expression values, adapted
from Geistlinger et a]. (2011), where a weight between 0 and 1
is assigned so that genes below the thresholds can be also con-
sidered but given lesser importance.

2.4 Model-based analysis

Model-based methods are a category of gene-set-based methods
that attempt to learn parameters for a dynamic model of any
given pathway using one phenotype, say, normal tissues. For
example, pathways are modeled using linear regression in SRI
(Zampieri et al., 2011) and Petri nets in GGEA (Geistlinger et al.,
2011). The constructed model is simulated on both phenotypes
(normal and diseased tissues). Differentially expressed pathways
are identiﬁed if the model is consistent in one phenotype but not
the other.

These methods provide a ﬁne-grain model of the pathways
because the parameters learnt during model construction
ensure that the expression values obey certain functions speciﬁed
by the model. This enables researchers to do more sophisticated
analysis like predicting the expression of certain genes under
some predefined conditions. However, the drawback of these
methods is that the parameters are hard to estimate when creat-
ing such a fine-grain model of pathways. Thus, while large data-
bases of pathways exist, there are far fewer fine-grain pathway
models available for use.

3 METHODS

3.1 Subnetwork generation

We conjecture that one of the reasons SNet is consistent across datasets is
due to the fact that absolute gene-expression values were not used.
Instead, by considering the top 10% of the highly expressed genes, the
gene ranking is preserved across two independent datasets.

In our approach, we ﬁrst assign a fuzzy value, fs(eg,,1,,), to each gene,
gi, based on the ranking of its expression value eg,, 1,, within the sample pf.
We use two thresholds 61 and 62 to separate the upper and lower quan-
tiles of the genes within a sample so that any expression value that falls
between these quantiles is given a weight between 0 and 1 (Fig. 3).

The fuzzy value is assigned to each gene for every sample. This allows
us to perform majority voting to select genes to include in the subnet-
works. Each sample pj gives a partial vote fs(egl.,1,/.) (of value between 0
and 1) for each gene g,. In contrast, in SNet, every sample pf either gives
the gene g,- a total vote (of value 1) if gi’s expression is ranked in the top
10% in p], or gives g,- no vote if its expression is not in the top 10%.

Our goal in this step is to compute a gene list, which segregates the
pathways into smaller components. The voting criteria that determine
whether the gene g,- is accepted into this gene list are given below:

Zfs(egi,P/') > [B 

P/ED IDI

 

where D is the phenotype for which the subnetwork is generated, pf
ranges over the patients of phenotype D and fs is the fuzzy function
which converts the gene expression value egi, 1,, to a value between 0
and 1.

between 0 and 1 according to their ranks within a sample

Once the gene list is computed, subnetworks in each reference pathway
are generated by taking connected components induced by the genes in
this list. We ignore subnetworks that are less than size 5.

3.2 Subnetwork scoring

The goal in this step is to generate a subnetwork score for each sample so
that the population of scores for phenotype D and —'D can be differen-
tiated by using a suitable statistical test, e.g. t-test.

The ﬁrst method introduced in this paper is FSNet (Fumy SNet). In
FSNet, the acceptance criteria in Equation (1) are in fact an average of
partial votes for a particular gene across the phenotype D. We let each
gene in the subnetwork be scored by this average partial vote.

Let ,B*(g,-) denote the average partial vote described in Equation (1), i.e.

m.) =  (2)
Pi ED

Then, the score computed for sample k, for a particular subnetwork S is:

scorel’xs) = Efrem.) * 15*(gi). (3)

giES

In each sample pk, the score of a subnetwork S is basically the sum of
weighted average partial votes of genes in S that are highly expressed in
pk. The average partial votes can be thought of as a measure of agreement
between the samples of phenotype D. In SNet, when total votes are used,
the average total vote is the percentage of samples having gene g,- in the
top 10%.

The second method introduced in this paper is PFSNet (Paired Fuzzy
SNet). In PFSNet, instead of computing the gene scores with respect to
phenotype D, we also compute the gene scores with respect to phenotype
—'D. Hence, each node is given scores which we denote as ,B’f(g,-) and
,8’2‘(g,-), computed as follows:

mgr) = Zﬁ(eg“”i),r:(gi) = Z)  (4)

p/‘ED IDI p/E—‘D |_‘D|

 

Accordingly, for every subnetwork S, each patient of phenotype D can be
scored under [Elf and [533“, as follows:

Scorei’ks) = Zﬁ(eg1.pk)* mg». (5)

Score’z’WS) = Efﬁe...) * rug». (6)

3.3 Statistical test

In FSNet, we can simply compute subnetwork scores in Equation (3) for
the two phenotype populations. This gives us two distributions which we
want to discriminate from each other. A t-test is done under the null
hypothesis that the mean score for the phenotype D and —'D populations
are not different. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean score for
phenotype D is greater than the mean score for phenotype —'D. The
signiﬁcant subnetworks identiﬁed at this step are enriched in phenotype
D. To discover subnetworks enriched in phenotype —'D, we compute the
node scores in Equation (2) using the —'D samples, and repeat the same
process of statistical testing.

In PFSNet, for a subnetwork S that behaves differently between the
two phenotypes, we expect the two scores Score’f" (S) and Score’z’k (S) in
Equations (5) and (6) to differ from each other for any sample pk. Since
these scores arise from the same sample pk and subnetwork S, we can do a
paired t-test, under the null hypothesis that the difference in scores gives
us a distribution with mean = 0. To ﬁnd subnetworks that are enriched in
the other phenotype, we compute the node scores in Equation (4) using
the —'D samples.

3.4 Permutation test

As the null distribution may not really be represented by the theoretical
distribution (Gatti et al., 2010; Goeman and Buehlmann, 2007; Venet
et al., 2011), we generate the null distribution by a permutation proced-
ure. We randomly swap the class labels (1000 times) for each datasetiie
randomly assigning a sample to belong to either phenotype D or —'D
while maintaining the original proportion of D and —'D samplesiand
obtain a distribution of subnetwork scores. From this null distribution,
we estimate at 5% signiﬁcance level on one-tail of the distribution,
whether a subnetwork which we compute for our original dataset is stat-
istically signiﬁcant.

4 RESULTS

We use pathways from PathwayAPI (Soh et al., 2010), a data-
base that uniﬁes popular pathway databases like KEGG (Kane-
hisa et al., 2012; Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), Wikipathways
(Kelder et al., 2012) and Ingenuity (Ingenuity, 1998).

For each of the three disease types studied hereiLeukemia
(Armstrong et al., 2002; Golub et al., 1999), Childhood Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL subtype) (Ross et al., 2004;
Yeoh et al., 2002) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)
(Haslett et al., 2002; Pescatori et al., 2007)7we obtain two inde-
pendent datasets which are produced using different microarray
platforms. For each disease type, we run PFSNet, FSNet, SNet,
GSEA, GGEA, SAM and t—test on the two datasets independ-
ently and obtain two corresponding outputs.

We compare the results from the two datasets using two meas-
ures of Jaccard-like agreement, deﬁned below.

We use the subnetwork generation procedure mentioned in
Section 3.1 to generate the subnetworks in dataset 1. We then
test these subnetworks for statistical signiﬁcance using the pro-
cedure mentioned in Sections 3273.4 on datasets 1 and 2 inde-
pendently. Let the significant subnetworks identified by datasets
1 and 2 be SNl and SN2, respectively. Then the subnetwork-level
agreement is deﬁned as

SNl ﬂ SN2

SN 0 SNZ ' (7)

When testing GSEA, which identifies pathways instead of sub-
networks, we measure the pathway-level agreement which is
deﬁned analogously.

We also measure the agreement between the genes in the out-
put generated by the two independent datasets. Let the genes in
SNl and SN2 be GSN1 and GsNz, respectively, then the gene-level
agreement is deﬁned as

GSN1 ﬂ GSNZ
GSN1 U GSN2

(8)

4.1 Comparing PFSNet, F SNet and SNet

FSNet is ﬂexible enough to be able to emulate SNet by setting
61 = 62 = 10%. In this way, genes above the 90th percentile are
given a total vote and genes below the 90th percentile are given
no vote at all. This is equivalent to setting SNet with a = 10%.

When comparing PFSNet, FSNet and SNet, we ﬁx 61: 5%
and vary 62 between 5% and 50% for PFSNet and FSNet. We
also vary a between 5% and 50% for SNet. This allows more
genes to be considered in the subnetworks in all the methods. To
emulate majority voting, )3 is set at 50% (Fig. 4).

Our experiments show that when 61 (in FSNet and PFSNet) or
a (in SNet) is low, the subnetworks may not be a true represen-
tation of the disease simply because too few genes are chosen to
induce the subnetworks. But when too many genes are con-
sidered, there will be false positives showing up in the subnet-
works. For example, when the value for 62 is set at the extreme
ends (5% and 50%), the subnetworks have very low agreement
between datasets in all three methods. In the Leukemia dataset,
FSNet achieves the maximum subnetwork agreement of 100%
(62:20%) whereas SNet achieves the maximum subnetwork
agreement of 77% (or: 15%). In the DMD dataset, FSNet
achieves maximum subnetwork agreement of 90% (62:10%)
whereas SNet achieves maximum subnetwork agreement of
73% (or: 10%). In the ALL subtype dataset, FSNet achieves
maximum subnetwork agreement of 38% whereas SNet only
achieves 26%.

The results also show that giving genes that are not in the top
5% a partial vote is better than giving them a total vote. As we
allow more and more genes to be considered, FSNet generally
gives better subnetwork agreement than SNet. FSNet is thus
more robust towards noise when incorporating more genes.
For example, when 62 :0: = 50%, FSNet is able to get 69% sub-
network agreement but SNet only manages 40% in the
Leukemia dataset. Similarly in DMD, FSNet achieves 59%
whereas SNet achieves 29%.

In PFSNet, we get even higher subnetwork-level agreement
than both FSNet and SNet. This shows the node scores obtained
from the opposite phenotype play an important role in contri-
buting towards consistent subnetworks. In particular, while both
FSNet and SNet do not have very good subnetwork-level agree-
ment in the ALL subtype dataset (38% and 25%, respectively),
PFSNet is able to achieve 74%.

We also measure the gene-level agreement to check whether
the signiﬁcant subnetworks contain similar genes in the two data-
sets. We see a similar trend that PFSNet performs better than
FSNet which in turn performs better than SNet. In particular,
for the ALL subtype dataset which has the worst pathway-level

agreement reported above, the maximum gene-level agreement
for PFSNet, FSNet and SNet are 84%, 57% and 47%,
respectively.

4.2 Comparing with GSEA, GGEA, SAM and t—test

We compare our methods with GSEA, GGEA, SAM and t-test.
We run GSEA and GGEA on both datasets and measure
the level of pathway agreement between the two datasets. In
general, we achieve higher pathway-level agreement than
GSEA and GGEA. PFSNet has a pathway-level agreement be-
tween 5&100%, FSNet has a pathway-level agreement between
38775%, GSEA has a pathway-level agreement between 12757%
and GGEA has a pathway-level agreement between 18751%
(Table 1).

We also measure the gene-level agreement from signiﬁcant
subnetworks between each pair of datasets. In order to compare
this with GSEA, we computed the gene-level agreement from the
‘leading edge’ gene sets in each pair of datasets. The ‘leading
edge’ genes are those genes that appear in GSEA’s ranked list
at the point at which the KolmogoroviSmirnov running sum
reaches its maximum deviation from zero (Subramanian et al.,
2005). We also compare gene-level agreement with SAM and
t-test which identiﬁes individual differentially expressed genes.
PFSNet has a gene-level agreement between 5L100%, FSNet
has a gene-level agreement between 38788%, SNet has a gene-
level agreement between 29776%. In contrast, GSEA, SAM and

For PFSNet and FSNet, threshold values of 91 = 5%, 92: 15% are used.

GSEA has a gene-level agreement between 444%, SAM has a
gene-level agreement between 8750% and t-test has a gene-level
agreement between 8741% (Table 2).

4.3 Comparing pathways and subnetworks

As pathways are often large, many analyses involving the whole
pathways do not give consistent results. For example, when we
tested GSEA/GGEA in the previous subsection using pathways,
the level of agreement was generally low.

One of the contributions in SNet, FSNet and PFSNet is the
ability to break large pathways into smaller subnetworks. We
select significant subnetworks from SNet, FSNet and PFSNet,

Note: For PFSNet and FSNet, threshold values of 91: 5%, 92: 15% are used. For GSEA, the ‘leading edge genes’ were used. For SAM and t—test, we took genes at 5%
signiﬁcance level and also the top It genes indicated in brackets. D, subnetworks enriched in phenotype D; -D, subnetworks enriched in phenotype -D.

and test them using GSEA. We discover that many of these
subnetworks are also considered significant by GSEA/GGEA,
even though GSEA/GGEA had earlier considered the original
whole pathways from which these subnetworks were derived to
be insigniﬁcant.

We next test whether these subnetworks are consistently
declared signiﬁcant in two independent datasets by GSEA/
GGEA (Table 3). Subnetworks taken from PFSNet give the
highest agreement of ~100%, subnetworks taken from FSNet
give the highest agreement of ~71% and the subnetworks taken
from SNet give the highest agreement of ~50%. In contrast,
using large pathways, GSEA and GGEA have an agreement of
~57% and 51%, respectively.

4.4 Biologically signiﬁcant subnetworks

We also check the subnetworks consistently detected by PFSNet
for biological relevance. We discover that many subnetworks and
their genes are involved in relevant disease-related processes
known in the literature. Some of these subnetworks predicted
as signiﬁcant in PFSNet are not discovered by SNet. We
report these subnetworks ranked according to the P—Value com-
puted by PFSNet in Table 4 (also see Supplementary Material).
We will describe three example subnetworks for the respective
diseases to demonstrate their relevance to the diseases.

For DMD, the subnetwork responsible for striated muscle
contraction is shown in Supplementary Figure S5a. The cause
of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is well known to stem from the
gene Dystrophin, which codes for a protein attached to the cell
membrane (sacrolemma) of striated muscle cells (Goldstein and
McNally, 2010). When its expression is perturbed, the cell mem-
brane becomes fragile and permits an ampliﬁcation in calcium
signals into the muscle cell causing a cascade of signals to induce
cell death. Our subnetwork is generated around the Dystrophin
gene and implicates other genes belonging to the Myosin
(M YBPCI, M YBPCZ) and Troponin (TNNII, TNNI2) family.
The Myosin and Troponin genes are responsible for controlling
muscle contractions. The down-regulation of Troponin in DMD
patients might help explain muscle contracture, a condition in
which the muscle shortens. This is because with lower abundance
of Troponin, Myosin is able to bind to Actin. This mechanism
together with the ampliﬁcation of calcium causes the muscle to
constantly contract, shortening over time (Goldstein and
McNally, 2010; Krans, 2010).

DMD (GSEA) 0.90 0.57 0.50
DMD (GGEA) 0.54 0.71 0.45

 

For the Leukemia dataset (in which patients are either classi-
fied to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leu-
kemia), one of the signiﬁcant subnetworks that is biologically
relevant is part of the Interleukin-4 signaling pathway
(Supplementary Fig. S6b). The binding of Interleukin-4 to its
receptor (Cardoso et al., 2008) causes a cascade of protein acti-
vation involving JAKl and STAT6 phosphorylation. STAT6
dimerizes upon activation and is transported to the nucleus
and interacts with the RELA/NFKBl transcription factors,
known to promote the proliferation of T-cells (Rayet and
Gelinas, 1999). In contrast, acute myeloid leukemia does not
have genes in this subnetwork up-regulated and are known to
be unrelated to lymphocytes.

For the ALL subtype dataset, the patients are categorized to
either having the BCR-ABL oncogene or EZA-PBXI oncogene.
Antigen-processing pathway is one of the signiﬁcant subnet-
works. This suggests that lymphocytes elicit different response
in the two ALL subtypes. The immunophenotypic characteristics
of acute leukemias have been described in the literature (Hruak
and Porwit-MacDonald, 2002; Giunta and Pucillo, 2012). ALL
belonging to the BCR-ABL subtype express the cluster of differ-
entiation (CD) markers CD9 and CD10, whereas those belong-
ing to the EZA-PBXI subtype express the CD19 and CD45
markers.

Fig. 5. An example of a signiﬁcant subnetwork in the stirated muscle
contraction pathway. Large pathways containing many genes can be
easily missed by pathway-based methods. In contrast, PFSNet is able
to identify subnetworks within large pathways. (Pathway image from

the traditional method of testing individual genes for two main
reasons. First, gene sets represented by pathways make discovery
more interpretable. Second, the ability to identify gene sets
whose members might have only slight changes in individual
gene expression values.

However, pathways become too generalized when they are
large. Such a pathway may also be missed even when a subnet-
work within it is indeed important for the disease (Fig. 5).
Breaking down pathways to subnetworks provides even better
interpretability. Moreover, we discover that previous methods
used in microarray data analysis produce ‘signiﬁcant’ gene sets
or pathways that are not very consistent across datasets of the
same disease.

Methods that analyze subnetworks like SNet also have their
shortcomings that it is hard to decide what thresholds to use
because a too-relaxed threshold will include some non-relevant
genes and a too-stringent threshold will exclude some relevant
genes.

In this article, we have introduced two improvements to SNet:
by incorporating the fuzziﬁcation technique (FSNet), and by
computing paired t-statistic based on the fuzzy score of two

phenotypes (PFSNet). We have found that subnetworks identi-
ﬁed by FSNet and PFSNet shows higher consistency across
independently obtained datasets than other methods.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Discovering useful associations between biomedical
concepts has been one of the main goals in biomedical text-
mining, and understanding their biomedical contexts is crucial in the
discovery process. Hence, we need a text-mining system that helps
users explore various types of (possibly hidden) associations in an
easy and comprehensible manner.

Results: This article describes FACTA+, a real-time text-mining
system for finding and visualizing indirect associations between
biomedical concepts from MEDLINE abstracts. The system can
be used as a text search engine like PubMed with additional
features to help users discover and visualize indirect associations
between important biomedical concepts such as genes, diseases
and chemical compounds. FACTA+ inherits all functionality from
its predecessor, FACTA, and extends it by incorporating three
new features: (i) detecting biomolecular events in text using a
machine learning model, (ii) discovering hidden associations using
co-occurrence statistics between concepts, and (iii) visualizing
associations to improve the interpretability of the output. To the best
of our knowledge, FACTA+ is the first real-time web application that
offers the functionality of finding concepts involving biomolecular
events and visualizing indirect associations of concepts with both
their categories and importance.

Availability: FACTA+ is available as a web application at
http://refine1-nactem.mc.man.ac.uk/facta/, and its Visualizer is
available at http://refine1-nactem.mc.man.ac.uk/facta-visualizer/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Text search engines such as PubMed are crucial in everyday
research activities in biomedical sciences as a signiﬁcant fraction
of biomedical knowledge is still accessible only in textual form. We
have previously developed FACTA, a text-mining system designed
to help researchers ﬁnd direct associations between biomedical
concepts in an interactive fashion (Tsuruoka et al., 2008). It is
capable of producing ranked lists of important biomedical concepts,
e.g. genes, diseases and chemical compounds, which are considered
relevant to the query according to their co-occurrence statistics. The
system has also been used as a search engine (Kemper e1 (11., 2010)
to link biomolecular pathways to textual evidence.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

This article describes three new classes of functionality that
are introduced to extend and improve FACTA. The ﬁrst extension
is the use of biomolecular events as semantic metadata used
for search. Semantic metadata derived from text to index digital
documents for retrieval purposes have been used in systems like
SUISEKI (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002), iHOP (Hoffmann and
Valencia, 2005), Chilibot (Chen and Sharp, 2004), GoWeb (Dietze
and Schroeder, 2009), Hanalyzer (Leach et al., 2009), Semantic
MEDLINE (Kilicoglu e1 (11., 2008), MEDIE (Miyao et al., 2006),
EBIMed (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2007) and KLEIO (Nobata
et al., 2008). Automatic extraction of events has a broad range
of applications in biology (Ananiadou et al., 2010), ranging from
support for the creation and annotation of pathways (Kemper et al.,
2010) to automatic population or enrichment of databases. This
novel event extension allows users to specify a concept which
involves a biomolecular event.

The second extension is to help users discover indirectly
associated concepts. Discovering hidden, previously unknown and
potentially useful associations between biomedical concepts such
as diseases and chemical compounds from the literature is a long-
standing goal in biomedical text-mining (Swanson and Smalheiser,
1997). The pioneering work of Swanson (1986) hypothesized the
role of ﬁsh oil in clinical treatment of Raynaud’s disease, combining
different pieces of information from the literature, and the hypothesis
was later conﬁrmed with experimental evidence. Among various
approaches to the automatic generation of such hypotheses (Frijters
et al., 2010; Weeber et al., 2003, 2005; Wren e1 (11., 2004), we adopt a
simple approach using two-step associations. More speciﬁcally, we
attempt to discover indirect associations by combining two known
associations which are obtained from direct co-occurrence statistics.
In this work, we give a probabilistic interpretation to the strengths
of the discovered indirect associations, which allows the system to
rank them in the order of their expected amount of information.

The third extension is visualization. The output format of FACTA
was a tabular format—the associated concepts found by the system
are categorized, ranked and presented in multiple columns. Although
the tabular format may be useﬁil enough in most cases, visualizing
the output can help the user grasp the results more intuitively. The
visualization component we have introduced in FACTA+ uses a
technique called treemapping (Shneiderman, 2009), which enables
the user to easily understand the relative importance of many
different concepts.

This article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our
machine learning approach to detecting biomolecular events in
text. Section 3 presents our algorithm for discovering indirect

associations by using co-occurrence statistics. Section 4 describes
the ﬁinctionality of visualizing associations detected by the text-
mining components. Concluding remarks are given in Section 5.

2 RECOGNIZING BIOMOLECULAR EVENTS

The ﬁrst extension we have introduced in FACTA is the ability
to detect biomolecular events mentioned in MEDLINE articles,
thereby allowing the user to issue queries including such events.
For example, FACTA+ allows the user to specify the documents
that contain the word ‘ERK2’ and also mention positive regulation
events, by using the query ‘ERK2 GENIA:Positive_regulation’.
This extension is motivated by the fact that biomolecular events
have recently received considerable attention as an important type
of information in biomedical text-mining (Ananiadou et al., 2010;
Bjome et al., 2010; Miwa et al., 2010).

In this work, our deﬁnition of biomolecular events follows that
of the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008), in which events are
basically characterized by verbs or nominalized verbs. For example,
the sentence ‘In Escherichia Coli, glnAP2 may be activated by
NifA.’ contains one event speciﬁed by the verb ‘activated’, with
its arguments being ‘In Escherichia Coli’, ‘glnAP2’ and ‘NifA’. In
the GENIA event deﬁnition, every event is represented with a trigger
and their arguments. Table 1 shows some examples of the events in
the corpus with the trigger words italicized. For example, ‘express’
is the trigger word for the gene expression event in the ﬁrst row in
the table.

Recognizing the complete information on events involves the task
of detecting triggers and their arguments, and there is a large body of
previous work tackling this problem (Airola et al., 2008; Divoli and
Attwood, 2005; Huang et al., 2004; Miwa et al., 2009; Miyao et al.,
2009). However, we are not concerned with the task of detecting
arguments in this article, since FACTA+ only uses information on
abstract-level occurrences of concepts.

Since every event is represented with a trigger, what we need for
event recognition is a component that can accurately detect triggers
in text. Perhaps the most straight-forward approach to detecting
trigger words in text is to use a dictionary, but pure dictionary-
matching is not suitable for event recognition, since trigger words
are often very ambiguous. For example, as seen in Table 1, the word
‘express’ is used as a trigger word for the gene expression event,
but the word ‘express’ is a very common verb and used in many
different meanings. Therefore, including the word ‘express’ in the
dictionary would produce many false positive matchings.

We use a machine learning-based approach to sidestep this
ambiguity problem, and use the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al.,

Table 1. Examples of event-describing phrases

2008) as training data. More speciﬁcally, we used the data released
for the BioNLP’09 shared task (Kim et al., 2009) for training and
testing our machine learning models. This shared task data is derived
from the GENIA event corpus and contains annotations on nine
event types concerning protein biology, which are a subset of the
biomolecular events deﬁned in the GENIA event ontology.

The machine learning models trained on the shard task data are
used to recognize event triggers in text and their event types, and
FACTA+ simply regards the detection of a trigger as an occurrence
of the corresponding event in the abstract. Although this simple
approach has a risk of producing false positives—because we
disregard some semantically important types of information such
as modality and negation (Garten et al., 2010; Krallinger, 2010;
Nawaz et al., 2010), we leave it for future work.

2.1 Related work

The most straight-forward approach to detecting trigger words is
to use a dictionary. Buyko et al. (2009) created a dictionary by
manually curating and extending a lexicon derived from the original
GENIA corpus with the help of researchers with a background
in biology. A disambiguation step is performed by considering
the co-occurrence statistics between each trigger word with event
types in a training corpus. This disambiguation is used for some
dictionary-based approaches [e.g. Kilicoglu and Bergler (2009),
MacKinlay et al. (2009)]. Vlachos et al. (2009) extracted frequent
triggers using a one-sense-per-term assumption, and performed soft
matching (using lemmas and stems) to alleviate the problem of
potential variability of trigger words. Vlachos (2010) extended
the extracted dictionary by incorporating ‘light’ and ‘ultra-light’
triggers, which represent the discriminative modiﬁers of triggers.
Kaljurand et al. (2009) extracted the dictionary from a training
corpus, and disambiguated the trigger words by considering two
kinds of co-occurrence statistics: one between each token and token
considered to be a trigger and one between an event structure
(event type and argument combination) and the trigger. Kilicoglu
and Bergler (2009) manually cleaned the dictionary by removing
ambiguous triggers, and also added variations of preﬁxes and
nominal forms of verbs to the dictionary. Van Landeghem et al.
(2009) built two separated manually cleaned dictionaries for unary
events and other events. Cohen et al. (2009) selected triggers by
iteratively testing manually constructed patterns.

Another popular approach is to use machine learning. Bjorne
et al. (2009) and Miwa et al. (2010) used a multi-class support
vector machines (SVMs) to detect and disambiguate trigger words.
Morante et al. (2009) detected and disambiguated trigger words

Discovering and visualizing indirect associations between biomedical concepts

 

using IBl memory-based classiﬁer. MacKinlay et al. (2009)
combined the outputs from a dictionary-based look-up tagger and a
conditional random ﬁeld (CRF)-based tagger.

Some other approaches detected events without a specialized
module for trigger detection. Riedel et al. (2009) and Poon and
Vanderwende (2010) detected events using Markov logic networks
(MLNs). Neves et al. (2009) used the case-based reasoning,
which ﬁnds ‘case-solution’ of a token including event, trigger, and
argument types by retrieving the most similar, frequent case in the
training data. Hakenberg et al. (2009) extracted shortest link paths on
parse tree in events as queries, and also created regular expression-
based patterns for regulation events. They grouped similar terms
together manually, and applied both queries and patterns to the
development and test datasets to detect triggers and arguments.

2.2 Detecting trigger words

To detect trigger words, we use a CRF model (Lafferty et al.,
2001). CRF models are log-linear probabilistic models for predicting
sequences, which are widely used in biomedical text-mining as the
machine learning model for named entity recognition (Okanohara
et al., 2006; Settles, 2004). The task of detecting trigger words
can be performed with a CRF model by converting the task to a
sequence prediction problem, in which the trigger sequences are
represented with the ‘IOB2’ representation (Sang and Veenstra,
1999). In this representation, the beginning word of a trigger is
given the ‘B’ tag. The following words are given the ‘1’ tag.
The other words in the sentence are given the ‘0’ tag. The task
of the CRF model is then to predict an ‘IOB’ sequence for a
given sentence. In this work, the ‘IOB’ tags are combined with
the nine different types of biomolecular events deﬁned in the
BioNLP’09 shared task data (Available at http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-
tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask/).

2.3 Joint learning

In this work, we propose to use a model that performs the
joint learning to recognize event triggers and protein names
simultaneously. The motivation for our joint learning approach is
that the presence of a protein name often indicates the presence
of a trigger word in its vicinity. It should be noted that, unlike
the shared task setting, we cannot use the information from gold-
standard annotations for protein names, because we need to process
the whole MEDLINE corpus for FACTA+.

The joint CRF model uses three additional tags: ‘B-Protein’,
‘I-Protein’ and ‘Filler’. Table 2 shows an example of an IOB tag
sequence for the sentence ‘CD44 activated the transcription factor
AP-1’. Note that the trigger word ‘activated’ is followed by a protein
name but there is a gap between them. The tags assigned to ‘CD44’,
‘AP’, ‘-’ and ‘1’ are the ones added to recognize protein names.
The ‘Filler’ tags are introduced to represent the regions that reside
between the protein names and trigger words belonging to the same
event. The ﬁller tags enable the CRF model to propagate information
from the existence of trigger words to non-adjacent protein names.
In other words, the fact that a trigger word is followed by a protein
name is captured by two transition features: (i) transition from ‘B-
Positive_regulation’ to ‘Filler’ and (ii) transition from ‘Filler’ to
‘B_Protein’.

2.4 Experiments

We present experimental results to evaluate the performance of our
joint learning approach. We compare our joint learning approach
against two baseline approaches (models). The three CRF models
used in the experiments are as follows.

(1) Triggers Only
A model limited to recognize only trigger words. The training
data contains only the annotations on trigger words. Since
there are nine different types of events in the data, this
model considers 19(=2><9+ 1) different possible tags for
each word.

(2) Joint
A model to recognize protein names and trigger words jointly.
However, the training data for this model does not include
the Filler tag. This model considers 21(=19+2) different
possible tags for each word.

(3) Joint + Filler
A model to recognize protein names and trigger words jointly.
The training data also include the Filler tag as described in
the previous subsection. This model considers 22(=21+ 1)
different possible tags for each word.

We trained these CRF models using the training data (consisting
of 800 MEDLINE abstracts) in the BioNLP’09 shared task corpus,
and evaluated them using its development data (consisting of 150
abstracts). The corpus was preprocessed with simple rule-based
scripts to perform sentence segmentation and tokenization. The
feature templates used in our CRF models are shown in Table 3.

The features include word n-grams, substrings and the shape of the
current word and tag transitions.

Table 4 shows the results. The ﬁrst nine rows in the table
correspond to the nine types of biomolecular events deﬁned in the
corpus, and the bottom row shows the micro-average of the scores.
Our proposed approach (i.e. the ‘Joint+Filler’ model) signiﬁcantly
outperforms the ‘Triggers Only’ model. This shows that the
contextual information from the protein names is useful in detecting
trigger words. It should also be noted that the performance of the
Joint model without the ﬁller tag is worse than the ‘Joint+Filler’
model, suggesting that it is important to explicitly transfer the
information on the neighbouring tags in a CRF model.

Our approach consistently improved the performance for
detecting event triggers, but the performance of detecting binding
and regulation events was not very high. This is because these events
can take multiple arguments, and also because regulation events
can take other events as arguments. Rich linguistic information is
required to deal with such event structures, and such triggers are not
our current focus.

Note that the performance ﬁgures presented in this table are not
comparable to those reported for the BioNLP shared task, since
we did not use the gold stande information on the gene/protein
names due to our purpose to evaluate the accuracy of trigger
detection in a real-world setting where no gold standard annotation
for gene/protein names are available.

The machine learning model described above (i.e. ‘Joint + Filler’)
was applied to the whole MEDLINE corpus containing 20 033 079
articles, and the recognized events are indexed by FACTA+ so that
it can accept queries including biomolecular events.1 The number
of articles indexed for each event type ranged from 53 262 (Protein
catabolism) to 1 537 441 (Regulation).

We have also carried out a small-scale experiment to assess the
quality of this indexing for the whole MEDLINE. We asked a
bioNLP researcher with biology background to check the 10 latest
articles returned by FACTA+ for each event class to see whether they

are really relevant to the target class. In other words, the abstract-
level precision was manually evaluated for each event class. The
result was that 86 out of the 90 abstracts were actually relevant to
the target event class.2 Although the recall of this event indexing is
not completely clear, the precision is probably good enough to be
used in practice.

3 DISCOVERING INDIRECT ASSOCIATIONS

A common approach to automatic discovery of useﬁil hypotheses
is to combine two (or more) known associations, i.e. if concept
X is associated with concept Y, and concept Y is associated
with concept Z, then the potential association between X and
Z is considered as a useﬁil hypothesis unless there is already
a known association between X and Z. This approach is often
called Swanson’s ABC model approach after his seminal work on
literature-based hypothesis generation (Swanson, 1990). Figure 1
illustrates this approach in the context of implementing it on
FACTA+, where the user provides a starting concept as a query
to the system. We call the concepts that are directly associated with
the query the pivot concepts, and the concepts that are indirectly
associated with the query through those pivot concepts the target
concepts.

3.1 Related work

There are a number of publicly available software tools that offer the
functionality for discovering indirect associations. Anni 2.0 (Jelier
et al., 2008) is a Java client—server application which provides an
ontology-based interface to MEDLINE. It can ﬁnd concepts that
have many intermediate concepts in common, thereby allowing the
user to discover concepts that do not directly co-occur with the
starting concept. Unlike FACTA+, the starting concept is deﬁned
as a combination of predeﬁned concepts provided by the system,
i.e. free keywords cannot be used to deﬁne a concept. BITOLA
(Hristovski et al., 2005) is a web application which allows the user
to retrieve target concepts using MeSH terms as pivot concepts.
It can also incorporate biomedical knowledge (e.g. chromosomal

 

2Note that the precision scores reported in Table 4 are calculated by entity-
level exact matching, which is much more strict than abstract-level precision.

location) to improve the precision of the output. BITOLA requires
the user to specify each pivot concept manually. In other words,
the pivot concepts that are not selected by the user are not used
for computing the association strengths between the query concept
and the target concepts, whereas FACTA+ retrieves target concepts
by considering all potential pivot concepts of a speciﬁed class.
Arrowsmith (Smalheiser et al., 2009) is perhaps a more well-known
tool for literature-based hypotheses generation, but it is designed
to ﬁnd concepts or terms that interlink two distinct concepts—it is
more similar, in our terminology, to ﬁnding pivot concepts given
a query and a target concept. CoPub Discovery (Frijters et al.,
2010) is a web application based on a co-occurrence database in
CoPub (Frijters et al., 2008). It allows the user to discover not
only target concepts by considering all potential pivot concepts of
a speciﬁed class, also but pivot concepts given a query and a target
concept. It employed two concept classes Gene and BioConcept for
pivot concepts, and used regular expressions to search for keywords
in MEDLINE and linking a query to the starting concept, while
FACTA+ employs six concept classes, event-based detection and
ﬂexible keyword matching. CoPub Discovery shows the ranking of
the target concepts, whereas FACTA+ incorporates a visualization
for the indirect associations.

As for the scoring scheme for ranking indirect associations,
Yetisgen-Yildiz and Pratt (2009) describe a comprehensive overview
of existing approaches and compare the performance of four
different criteria (Association Rules, TF-IDF, Z-score and Mutual
Information Measure) using a cut-off date technique.

3.2 Interface

Like many text search engines, FACTA+ accepts arbitrary keywords,
concept identiﬁes or their boolean combination as a query to specify
the starting concept (i.e. concept X in Fig. 1). The system ﬁrst
retrieves pivot concepts using co-occurrence statistics from the
literature, and then produces target concepts that are scored and
ranked in accordance to their association strengths with the query
and pivot concepts. One of the distinct features of our system is that
it achieves real-time responses in most cases while allowing the user
to use a very ﬂexible query as the input to the system.

Currently, FACTA+ accepts the following six classes of
biomedical concepts as pivot and target concepts: human

genes/proteins, diseases, symptoms, drugs, enzymes and chemical
compounds. The user can choose one of these classes as pivot and
target concepts when performing a search.

As an example of indirect associations, the search result for the
input query ‘E-cadherin and GENIA:Negative_regulation’ returned
by FACTA+ is shown in Figure 2. The ﬁrst row in the table
shows that the query concept is indirectly associated with a disease
‘acute respiratory failure’ through multiple genes including tumour
suppressor candidate 3. The visualized version of this search result
is shown in Figure 4.

E-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule involved with the binding
between a cell and other cells or extracellular matrix. The search
results shown in Figures 2 and 4 indicate that E-cadherin is
associated with multiple nervous system disorders (e. g. Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy) via several proteins/genes,
even though E-cadherin itself rarely appears with such disorders
(see also Fig. 3 for direct associations). This indirect search result
suggests that E-cadherin could be a potential candidate of drug target
for nervous system disorders.

3.3 Ranking

Since the number of indirectly associated concepts can be vast, it
is important to rank them properly when they are presented to the
user. On the one hand, the ranking criterion should favour ‘hidden’
associations, because the associations that can be easily observed
in the existing literature are not interesting to the users who are
seeking for novel associations. In fact, such ‘known’ associations
can be browsed by using the existing ﬁinctionality of FACTA.

On the other hand, the indirect associations output by the system
need to be plausible. To incorporate these two factors, FACTA+
deﬁnes a ranking score for each target concept Zj as follows:

(score)=R(X,Zj) >< {—logD(X,Zj)}, (1)

where D(X ,2!) is the strength of direct association between concept
X and Zj, and R(X,Zj) is the reliability of the indirect association
between the two. Notice that this score can translate into the expected
amount of information (in the information theoretic sense) if R(X , 2])
and D(X, 2]) are given as probability values. The term — logD(X .21)
takes on a large value if the strength of association between X
and Zj is weak. In other words, this term represents how hidden
or surprising the association is.

If we assume that D(-,-) are given as probabilities, and that all
associations connecting X with Zj are independent, the reliability
term can be computed as follows:

m
R(X,Zj)=1—n{1—D(X,Yi)D(Yii%)}i (2)

i=1
since the probability that the connection between X and Zj is true is
given by the probability that there is at least one true path connecting
X with Zj. Now the remaining question is how D(-, -) are computed as
probabilities. In FACTA+, we approximate them using conditional

probabilities:

D(V,W)=max{P(V|W),P(W|V)}, (3)

where P(V|W) is the (smoothed) conditional probability of the
occurrence of concept V given that of concept W within the same
document. P(WIV) is deﬁned likewise. We take the maximum of

the conditional probabilities of both directions to avoid missing any
association detectable from direct co—occurrence statistics.

3.4 Indexing

To achieve real-time responses, we pre-compute the association
statistics between all predeﬁned concepts (i.e. between all possible
Ys and Zs) and store them on memory—this may sound prohibitively
expensive but is possible because we need to store only the
information about the pairs of concepts that actually co-occur
in at least one document. The number of pairwise associations
indexed for achieving real-time discovery of indirect associations
was 49 620 438.

The indexing for the predeﬁned concepts was performed by
dictionary matching. More speciﬁcally, we employed the longest
matching method using six different dictionaries built for the
aforementioned six classes of concepts. The number of unique
concepts indexed for the whole MEDLINE was 107060. One of
the major difﬁculties in the indexing process was the problem of
semantic ambiguity of the terms. We used a simple rule-based
method to alleviate the problem of acronym ambiguity, but the
ambiguity problems with terms like protein family names are
difﬁcult to solve and left for future work.

4 VISUALIZATION

The ranked list of found concepts is often used for showing the
results and is used in FACTA+ and other services like Arrowsmith,
and it is useful for displaying the details of the extracted results,

but lists are not well suited to grasp the big picture since the
ranking scores are not intuitive to use. We, therefore, developed
a Visualization component to make the found concepts easy
to understand. The primary technique used in this component
is treemapping (Shneiderman, 2009), a method for Visualizing
hierarchical data by using a set of rectangles. Figures 3 and 4 show
the Visualization of directly and indirectly associated concepts for
the query ‘E-cadherin and GENIA:Negative_regulation’. In these
Visualizations, each rectangle represents an individual concept, and
its area is proportional to the score given to the concept. The
component is built using Adobe Flash because it enables rich
graphical expressions suitable for Visualization like gradient ﬁll and
smooth animation.

4.1 Related work

One of the most well-known sites which use treemapping
is Newsmap (http://newsmap.jp/). Newsmap Visualizes popular
Google News stories. Stories are represented as rectangles and they
are categorized into countries or topics. Users can browse the ﬁill
text of the story by clicking a rectangle.

4.2 Visualizing direct and indirect associations

FACTA+ has two Visualization components: one for presenting
directly associated concepts (e.g. Fig. 3) and the other indirectly
associated concepts (e.g. Fig. 4). The functionality and usage of
these Visualization components are explained in this subsection.
The directly associated concepts to a user query are Visualized
as rectangles. The concepts are grouped into six categories (human

genes/proteins, diseases, symptoms, drugs, enzymes and chemical
compounds) and each category forms a parent rectangle. The number
of concepts shown is limited at ﬁrst, but more results become
visible by using a pager control. Users can easily grasp the relative
importance of each concept using the size of each rectangle. The
rectangles are arranged to maintain the similar aspect ratios to
make the rectangles visually recognizable. Users can also focus
on a particular set of categories by using check boxes. The layout
of rectangles is recalculated instantaneously. This is done using a
smooth animation so that the change is visually traceable.

The method for visualizing indirectly associated concepts is
slightly different to the one for directly associated concepts. Pivot
concepts co-occurred with the query are shown on the left-hand
side, and target concepts co-occurred with the pivot concepts are
shown on the right-hand side. In addition to the treemapping,
we introduced a ‘link’ visualization between pivot concepts and
target concepts. Links represent co-occurrences between pivot
and target concepts, and the width of each link indicates the
strength of its association. When users point the mouse cursor
on a particular pivot concept, links from the concept to its
corresponding target concepts appear. Similarly, when users point
a target concept, links from the concept to its corresponding pivot
concepts appear.

In both directly and indirectly associated concepts views, users
can browse underlying documents by clicking a rectangle or a link
and select ‘view documents’.

5 CONCLUSION

We have presented three extensions which have recently been
introduced in FACTA+, a text search engine for MEDLINE.

First, we have proposed a joint learning approach to detecting
biomolecular events described in text. The performance of detecting
trigger words has been signiﬁcantly improved by performing the task
jointly with protein name recognition.

Second, we have presented a method for detecting indirect
associations. The associations are ranked by the level of novelty
and reliability, which are estimated by combining the strengths
of multiple known associations that are directly observable from
co-occurrence statistics in the literature.

Third, we have implemented a novel visualization component
which provides an intuitive overview of the discovered concepts
and their associations. Each concept is represented with a coloured
rectangle; the colour shows the category and the area indicates the
importance. Each association is displayed with a link whose width
indicates the importance.

The three classes of functionality described in this article are
implemented in FACTA+. The system accepts concept identiﬁers,
arbitrary keywords and their boolean combinations as a query
and immediately produces a ranked list (or its visualization) of
concepts that are indirectly associated with the query. FACTA+
is implemented in C++ and currently running on a single
Linux server with 32 GB of memory. The service is available
at http://reﬁne1-nactem.mc.man.ac.uk/facta/, and the visualization

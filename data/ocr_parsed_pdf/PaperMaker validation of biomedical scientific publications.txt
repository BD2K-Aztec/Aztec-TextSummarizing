ABSTRACT

Motivation: The automatic analysis of scientific literature can
support authors in writing their manuscripts.

Implementation: PaperMaker is a novel lT solution that receives
a scientific manuscript via a Web interface, automatically analyses
the publication, evaluates consistency parameters and interactively
delivers feedback to the author. It analyses the proper use
of acronyms and their definitions, and the use of specialized
terminology. It provides Gene Ontology (GO) and Medline Subject
Headings (MeSH) categorization of text passages, the retrieval of
relevant publications from public scientific literature repositories, and
the identification of missing or unused references.

Result: The author receives a summary of findings, the manuscript
in its corrected form and a digital abstract containing the GO and
MeSH annotations in the NLM/PubMed format.

1 INTRODUCTION

The primary purpose of scientiﬁc publications is to report on new
scientiﬁc ﬁndings and to embed them in prior research work.
The author receives best acceptance if a large audience accurately
perceives what he had in mind, and manuscripts of good quality
have a higher likelihood to pass the review process.

Scientists write their manuscripts in loosely structured natural
language but have to comply with standards concerning the
document format, the use of language and the citation of prior work.
The availability of electronic data resources such as ontologies,
reference databases and electronic literature in the biomedical
scientiﬁc community exposes the scientists to new requirements: the
use of domain-speciﬁc terminology has to follow standards from
scientiﬁc databases and the author has to support submission of
data to the reference database as part of the manuscript submission
process (Leitner and Valencia, 2008). Furthermore, the author has to
avoid duplication of the existing work. Reliable automatic feedback
on any of these parameters will improve the speed and efﬁciency of
the manuscript preparation phase and the review phase for authors,
publisher and reviewers. Existing solutions for the analysis of
the scientiﬁc literature focus on improving the search of relevant

information (Kim and Rebholz-Schuhmann, 2008) but cannot be
applied during the manuscript preparation phase.

2 METHODS

2.1 Text analysis (Whatizit) and evaluation

PaperMaker uses the modular infrastructure of Whatizit (Kirsch et al. . 2006;
Rebholz-Schuhmann et al.. 2008). Modules are described in the order as
they are applied (Fig. 1). Candidates for acronyms are all tokens with 2711
characters in length having an initial uppercase letter. Tokens at the beginning
of a sentence were ignored as well as stop words including highly frequent
English function words (e.g. In. If). The co-occurrence of the acronym with
the long form was identiﬁed with syntactic patterns (Schwartz and Hearst.
2003).

Terminologies for the named entity recognition and normalization comply
with public resources [e.g. UniProth/Swiss-Prot. Gene Ontology (GO).
DrugBank. Medline Subject Headings (MeSH). see below]. Complete
Medline has been analyzed to generate a terminological resource of all known
biomedical terms.

The annotation of the gene and protein named entities is based on the
BioLexicon (prec/rec: 94/63; Rebholz-Schuhmann et al.. 2009). ChEBI
was the reference data resource for the identiﬁcation of chemical entities.
For the annotation of medical entities we used the terms for diseases and
syndromes from UMLS (Jimeno etal. . 2008) in combination with drug names
(DrugBank).

The annotation of text passages with G0 concepts uses the solution by
(Gaudan et al.. 2008): F -measure close to 40% for the terms at Rank 1. The
categorization of manuscripts with MeSH terms relies on k-nearest neighbor
clustering to attribute text passages to MeSH categories similar to the ones
delivered with Medline abstracts (Trieschnigg et al.. 2009).

The references in the document were identiﬁed based on syntactic
patterns and compared with the list of citations in the reference section.
The syntactical patterns are deﬁned according to the citation standard in
NucleicAcids Research (NAR). Missing publications in the reference section
as well as unused citations are recognized by the automatic analysis. The
identiﬁcation of related work is achieved by translating a given passage into
a Lucene query. which is then run against the Medline and Pubmed Central
repositories. PaperMaker’s analysis was evaluated on 50 randomly selected
publications from NAR.

2.2 Processing of proprietary document formats

The Web application PaperMaker uses JODConverter to convert ﬁles
into the OpenDocument Format (ODF). an XML format. It integrates
OpenOfﬁce.org/Writer functionality that enables import and export of
OpenDocument and Microsoft documents (DOC and RTF). Formatting
details in the document are preserved through special XML tags in the
document structure. Once the text has been analyzed and prepared to be
returned to the author. PaperMaker converts it back to the original XML
format. which can be used to generate the original and alternative ﬁle formats
(J ODConverter. OpenOfﬁce.org).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Use of PaperMaker

The user interface enables the upload of manuscripts in different ﬁle
formats (see Section 2.2). None of the data will be stored on site.
The interface provides an overview on the availability of required
services (top right comer) and a button for help.

The uploaded manuscript will be processed step by step by the
modules M1—M8 (Fig. 1). Each module is embedded in its own Web
page with its own Help page and the ‘GoTo’-butting indicates the
index of the next module. The last page summarizes the results of
the analysis.

3.2 Identiﬁcation of unknown terms

In the ﬁrst step (module M1), we determine the number of
unknown, and thus potentially non-standard or misspelled terms in
the scientiﬁc publications. A potentially unknown term is one which
is neither mentioned in the British National Corpus (BNC, general
English) nor in any Medline abstract. Both resources combined
contain 3 015437 distinct single-word token ’terms’ in total: 89%
from Medline only, 5% from both resources and 6% from BNC
only. All 50 documents contained unknown terms: 29.5 terms per
document and 1474 in total. Most unknown terms turned out to
be identiﬁers (64%, 935 terms): nomenclature identiﬁer, public
database identiﬁer and other identiﬁer, and author names.

The remaining 36% of unknown terms (539) are either novel
hyphenations of known terms (57%, in 47 publications) or truly
novel terms. Removing the hyphenation leads either to composite
terms or to single words (e.g. ﬁg leaf, pigeonhole) that conform to
dictionary resources (Shorter oxford English Dictionary). Amongst
the truly novel terms, we identiﬁed algorithms, methods, brand
names and gene names. A few terms are neologisms derived from
other English words (e.g. organismally). All remaining 22 novel
terms (4%) have been misspelled variants of known terms.

3.3 Categorization of known terms

3. 3.1 Acronyms resolution (M2) PaperMaker identiﬁed 1445
occurrences of a known acronym without a deﬁnition in all 50
documents (Gaudan et al., 2005). Of the occurrences, 49.6% (717)
were correct. False positive results included short sequences of
nucleotides, general English words and Roman numerals (e.g. AC,
AS and 11). Three hundred and sixteen acronym mentions are novel
and would require a deﬁnition: 11% (45) of the mentions represent
gene/protein named entities and were resolved at a later stage
through the biological entity tagger.

In contrast, the majority of acronyms were correctly deﬁned in the
manuscript. However, a small subset uses a less frequent deﬁnition.

The acronym resolution ﬁlter also identiﬁed acronyms that have
been deﬁned at least twice (14) and that have been used before its
proper deﬁnition.

3.3.2 Identiﬁcation of named entities (M3) The average
document contained 3877 words (reference section not included),
1242 unique words, 29 unique acronyms, 6 unique gene/protein
mentions, 18.5 chemical terms and 7 medical terms. Medical terms
were identiﬁed at 78.7% precision, protein/gene names at 71.2% and
chemical entities at 61.7% according to our manual analysis. The
low precision of the last module results from the fact that this set is
very heterogeneous (DNA is a chemical entity as well as glutamate).
Preferred names proposed by the reference data resources were used
at low frequency: 19.3% for medical terms, 33% for protein/gene
names and 46.3% for chemical entities.

3.3.3 G0 and MeSH recognition (M4, M5) PaperMaker assigns
ﬁrst GO terms and then MeSH taking the whole publication into
consideration. Forty percent (391 of 973) of the MeSH concepts
matched the manually attributed MeSH terms and 20% of manually
assigned MeSH headings were not identiﬁed.

3.3.4 Reference check module (M6) A total of 4738 publications
from PubMed Central were analyzed. Five hundred and seventy-
one publications had inconsistencies in the reference section. A
random selection of 54 publications was manually inspected to ﬁnd
12 (22%) true positive results where the authors were mentioned in
the bibliographic section but not referenced in the main text. False
positive results were due to authors being mentioned in tables or
pictures but not in the main text.

3.3.5 Related work and summary (M7, M8) In the last two steps,
the author receives an overview on related work and the summary
of all ﬁndings.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The integration of scientiﬁc publications into the biomedical data
resources is ongoing work (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2005).
PaperMaker supports authors in this integration work without
putting efforts to curation teams (Leitner and Valencia, 2008).
The ﬁnal result is the production of structured abstracts in the
NLM/PubMed format. Furthermore, the manuscript generation
process is well embedded into the literature search and the
referencing of relevant prior research.

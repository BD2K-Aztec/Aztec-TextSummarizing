ABSTRACT

Summary: Exploring microRNA (miRNA) regulations and protein—
protein interactions could reveal the molecular mechanisms
responsible for complex biological processes. Mirin is a web-based
application suitable for identifying functional modules from protein—
protein interaction networks regulated by aberrant miRNAs under
user-defined biological conditions such as cancers. The analysis
involves combining miRNA regulations, protein—protein interactions
between target genes, as well as mRNA and miRNA expression pro-
files provided by users. Mirin has successfully uncovered oncomirs
and their regulatory networks in various cancers, such as gastric
and breast cancer.

Availability and implementation: Mirin is freely available at http://

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short non-coding RNA molecules
that repress target gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level. miRNAs regulate critical biological processes such as cell
growth, tissue differentiation and embryonic development.
Therefore, corrupted miRNA and dysfunctional miRNA biogen-
esis may lead to various disorders, such as cancer. Most miRNAs
regulate a large number of genes, and so it is difﬁcult to deter-
mine the primary function of a given miRNA. Previous studies
report that complexity of miRNA regulation and topological
characteristics of proteiniprotein interaction networks (PINs)
are correlated (Hsu et al., 2008; Liang and Li, 2007; Lin et al.,
2012). Therefore, the interacting proteins targeted by a given
miRNA can reveal its function. Additionally, because PINs
are dynamic in cellular systems, they have frequently been inte-
grated with mRNA expression profiles to expose conditional
network modules under a biological state (Chen et al., 2014).
Consequently, integrating miRNA regulations with PINs and

expression proﬁles of miRNAs and mRNAs could provide
opportunities to identify miRNA-regulated PINs and their func-
tion under specific biological conditions, such as cancer versus
normal samples (Lee et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2012; Tseng et al.,
2011).

Here, we designed a web application, Mirin, to identify dis-
turbed miRNA regulatory subnetworks and their functions
under user-speciﬁed biological conditions. Mirin takes advantage
of miRNA targets and proteiniprotein interactions (PPIs), as
well as incorporating gene expression data, to create condition-
speciﬁc miRNA-mediated PINs. Although there already exists a
similar tool, mirConnX (Huang et al., 2011), it does not incorp-
orate PPIs. The core analytic procedure of Mirin has been used
to successfully identify cancer-associated miRNA-regulated PIN
modules in gastric (Tseng et al., 2011) and breast cancer (Lee
et al., 2013). Besides exploring individual miRNA-regulated
subnetworks, Mirin also takes the co-regulations of multiple
miRNAs into consideration to conduct a more comprehensive
analysis of miRNA regulatory networks.

2 OVERVIEW OF MIRIN

2.1 Implementation

Mirin offers user-friendly interfaces for researchers to construct and ex-
plore miRNA regulatory networks. The graphic interface was built in
PHP program with JavaScript to enhance user experience, and the ana-
lysis pipeline was implemented in back-end Perl and R scripts. The net-
work modules were visualized by Cytoscape web (Lopes et al., 2010).

2.2 Input data

To construct condition-speciﬁc miRNA regulatory networks, Mirin re-
quires miRNA and mRNA expression proﬁles obtained in terms of ex-
pression intensity by microarray or read count by next-generation
sequencing techniques. After receiving expression data, Mirin offers sev-
eral normalization methods (Supplementary Table S1), if necessary, and
executes statistical tests to identify differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs
and mRNAs between two user-deﬁned conditions. Alternatively, users
can upload DE miRNA and mRNA lists.

Mirin collects various predicted miRNA target (Supplementary
Table S2) and proteiniprotein interaction databases (Supplementary
Table S3); users can then choose their preferred ones. Additionally,
users can choose multiple miRNA target databases and use a criterion
to filter out low-conﬁdence targets.

2.3 Construction of miRNA-regulated modules

We described the core analysis pipeline in a previous study (Tseng et al.,
2011). For each DE miRNA, Mirin extracts coherent DE mRNA tar-
geted by the given miRNA, i.e. expression of the miRNA and a target is
negatively correlated, and together with the PPIs among these DE targets.
Mirin calls miRNA-target genes ‘LO’ genes. To better reveal the regula-
tory functions of the miRNA, Mirin expands the network to include
interacting partners (called ‘L1’) of L0 genes. Moreover, users can set
several criteria to construct more reliable and biologically meaningful
networks by ﬁltering out the L1 genes with fewer L0 partners and/or
including non-DE L1 genes.

2.4 Investigation of miRNA-regulated modules

Mirin offers several ways to investigate the miRNA-mediated network
modules. Firstly, to determine if a module is active under a speciﬁc con-
dition, Mirin assesses the signiﬁcance of the proportion of coexpressed
PPIs in the given module based on the expression proﬁles uploaded by
users (Supplementary Methods). Secondly, to reveal the relevant biolo-
gical processes, Mirin performs enrichment analysis to identify the en-
riched Gene Ontology (GO) terms for each module. Enrichment analysis
in Mirin provides node-based (i.e. conventional gene-set analysis) and
edge-based (i.e. extending GO annotation to network edges, proposed
by Lin et al., 2010) methods. From the ranked list of GO terms signiﬁ-
cantly overrepresented for each module, users can select terms to View
function-speciﬁc modules. These could assist users to infer plausible mo-
lecular mechanisms. Finally, users can investigate the co-regulation or
cross talk among miRNAs by incorporating more modules into the net-
work visualization. The construction of co-regulation module is based on
the common components of network modules of the miRNAs selected by
users. The major functions of Mirin are summarized in Figure 1.

3 DISCUSSION

To demonstrate the capabilities of Mirin, we applied it to inva-
sive carcinoma of the breast. Expression proﬁles of miRNAs and
mRNAs were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(Supplementary Tables S4 and SS). After executing the analysis
pipeline of Mirin, we identified the top 20 DE miRNAs (9 down-
regulated and 11 upregulated) in breast cancer tissue
(Supplementary Table S6). According to miR2Disease (Jiang
et al., 2009), 6 and 10 of the 20 miRNAs are associated with
breast and other cancers, respectively. We focused on miR-210
regulatory modules and found some interesting GO terms, such
as ‘response to estrogen stimulus’ and ‘positive regulation of ca-
nonical wingless receptor signaling pathway’, which are asso-
ciated with the carcinogenesis (Supplementary Table S7). From
a network View, we can see that miR-210 might inhibit caveolin l
and modulate estrogen receptor 1, which are estrogen-responsive
genes described as tumor suppressors in breast cancer (Fenne
et al., 2013) (Supplementary Fig. Sl). Furthermore, by using
Gene expression-based Outcome for Breast cancer Online
(Ringner et al., 2011), we found that the expression levels of
genes involved in the miRNA regulatory networks identiﬁed
by Mirin can signiﬁcantly affect breast cancer patient survival
rates (Supplementary Fig. S2). This case study exhibits how
Mirin could be used to help identify miRNA regulatory networks
associated with user-specified conditions.

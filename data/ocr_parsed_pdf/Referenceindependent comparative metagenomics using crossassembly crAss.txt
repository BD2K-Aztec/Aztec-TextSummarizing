2 METHODS
2.1 General approach

First, the user will combine the reads from all metagenomic datasets to be
compared into a cross-assembly, i.e. a single assembly from two or more
metagenomes. Note that it is important that all reads have unique iden-
tifiers across all the datasets combined. Cross-assembly can be done with
a de novo assembly tool of choice such as gsAssembler (Margulies et al.,
2005), MIRA (Chevreux et al., 2004) or Velvet (Zerbino and Birney,
2008). We note that it is beyond the scope of this article to evaluate the
performance of the different assembly tools and all the possible parameter
settings (Lin et al., 2011), although it seems that assembler settings opti-
mized for sequence fragments, such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs),
may perform better than assembler settings optimized for complete gen-
omes (see Supplementary File 2). The basic idea is that an assembly
program will link metagenomic reads derived from the same biological
source to one another in a well deﬁned way. The resulting contigs may be
interpreted as ‘metagenomic entities’ or traits that are shared between the
sampled environments. The results shown later to illustrate crAss were
generated using gsAssembler (Margulies et al., 2005) with default param-
eters, but the user can achieve similar results with alternative assembly
tools.

The crAss program takes as input the individual read files (one per
metagenome) in Fasta or Fastq format, as well as the ACE file that
contains the information about the assembled contigs. We note that the
user can strip the potentially privacy-sensitive sequence information from
these files before uploading, as is explained on the crAss help page.
Examples of input files for crAss analysis, including a simplified toy ex-
ample, are available through the crAss web site (http://edwards.sdsu.edu/
crass). For every contig, crAss counts the number of reads derived from
each metagenome and determines whether the contig is shared between
two or more samples (cross-contig). The degree of relatedness between
two metagenomes is calculated from this information according to four
distance formulas (see later).

The output of crAss consists of (i) a list of all contigs showing how
many reads from each metagenome it is composed of (for reference, this
list includes the identifiers of the unassembled singleton reads, which are
not used in the distance calculations), (ii) a symmetrical distance matrix
for each distance formula that contains the distances between all pairs of
metagenomes, and (iii) an image that summarizes the similarities between
the metagenomes (see Section 3). If the user combined two or three
metagenomes, the image will be an XY-plot or an XYZ-plot, respectively,
visualized using Gnuplot. 3D analyses are also presented as a triangle
plot. Note that a user can use the data in the contig list to create other
visualizations. If the user combined more than three metagenomes, there
will be one image for every distance formula, showing a cladogram cre-
ated on the basis of the respective distance matrix using BioNJ (Gascuel,
1997), and visualized using Drawtree version 3.68 from the Phylip pack-
age (Felsenstein, 1989).

2.2 Distance formulas

Comparison tools like Maxi<p (Angly et al., 2006) parametrize the deform-
ation necessary to morph one metagenome into another. crAss uses a
single dimension, a distance, for the comparisons. There are always many
ways to define distances between given sets of numbers. In crAss, the
distance between all pairs of metagenomes is calculated using four pos-
sible distance formulas. The first is Equation (1), a formula that has been
used to correct for genome size when calculating phylogenetic distances
between species (Dutilh et al., 2004; Dutilh et al., 2007; Korbel et al.,
2002). It is used here to correct for metagenome size when calculating
distances between samples.

Equation 1. Distance formula ‘SHOT’ (Korbel et al., 2002) used for
calculating the distance dilf between metagenomes i and j based on the
number of contigs c,- and C) that contain reads from these metagenomes,

respectively, and the number of cross-contigs cit) with reads from both
metagenomes.

6..
di..=1_+
’ (ﬁ-ci-cj)/(‘/c?+c})

The idea of this formula is to normalize the similarity signal C‘in for
metagenome size by dividing by an appropriate mean value of c,- and C], in
this case the square of the geometric mean divided by the root mean
square. As we will see, this mean is never far from the minimum of c,-
and C], min{c,-,c,~}. Therefore, when E,- and C) are far apart in value, the
signal cit) is not attenuated by dividing by a larger number than necessary.
It is instructive to rewrite the second term in Equation (1) as follows
[compare with Equation (4)]:

5121'

W-  - WW???) 2

Here, the similarity measure is seen as the root mean square of the
separately normalized quantities chi/c,- and chi/cf. In this form, it is easy to
see that we have the following inequality:

 

6111'

— <
ﬁ-n1in{ci,cj} 7

 

 5211'
-) S min{c,», 61-}

This points to the second distance metric, where we normalize the
similarity signal cit) for metagenome size by dividing by the smaller of
the two metagenomes.

Equation 2. Distance formula ‘minimum’ used for calculating the dis-
tance dilf between metagenomes i and j based on the number of contigs c,-
and C) that contain reads from these metagenomes, respectively, and the
number of cross-contigs cit) with reads from both metagenomes.

 = 1 — 
mm{ c,», cf}

Both Equations (1) and (2) are presence/absence-based formulas. They
assume that the presence of a contig or metagenomic trait in a sample (i.e.
the contig contains at least one read from that sample) is more inform-
ative than its abundance. In our experience, such a qualitative compari-
son can give insightful information for comparing metagenomes because
the number of reads assembled into a contig may not always reﬂect a
truly random sample from the community metagenome, owing to biases
that may result at the sampling, sequencing or assembly level. However,
we also include two more qualitative distance measures, where the
number of reads is assumed to reﬂect the abundance of the contig in
the environment. In the first, we index the complete set of observed
contigs by k=1,. . .,n, and let 17“- denote the number of reads in contig
k from metagenome i. We assume that the fraction of reads from meta-
genome i that are incorporated into contig k.

pk. _ L
1 27:1 "12’

is a measure of the relative importance of contig k to metagenome i, and

that the probability vector (or distribution)

Pi = (1711*, ---,17m*)

characterizes the metagenome i. Wootters has proposed a natural statis-
tical measure of distance between probability distributions (Wootters,
1981) that is closely related to distance measures associated with the
names of Fisher and Amari (Amari, 1982). It is based generally on the
minimum number of jumps that is required to get from one distribution
to another, where a jump is a statistical ﬂuctuation typical of a finite
sample from the distribution. The distance is normalized in such a way
that it is independent of the sample size used to establish a statistical

ﬂuctuation. This Wootters metric can be adapted to reﬂect the distance
between metagenomes as follows.

Equation 3. Distance formula ‘Wootters’ (Wootters, 1981) used for
calculating the distance dilf between metagenomes i and j based on the
fraction of reads pk,- and pm from these metagenomes, respectively, that
are incorporated into contig k.

di. j = £905 1  x/pki ‘qu')
[:1

As it may be expected that longer contigs attract more reads from
unrelated metagenomes by chance, we include a fourth distance formula
that mirrors Equation (1), but is based not on the fraction of
cross-contigs but on the fraction of reads assembled into cross-contigs.
Like Equation (3), this is a quantitative comparison that accounts for
skewed read distributions in contigs and corrects for biases, e.g. owing to
differences in contig length.

Equation 4. Distance formula ‘reads’ used for calculating the distance
dilf between metagenomes i and j based on the number of reads r,- and r)
from these metagenomes, respectively, that are incorporated into contigs,
and the number of reads rm and r),- from these metagenomes, respectively,
that are incorporated into shared cross-contigs.

 

Each of the four distance formulas that crAss offers is mathematically
natural for the structure of the data. Our expectation is that each will
prove useful for revealing interrelationships of particular sorts. Just which
metric will be most suitable for which type of comparison will teach us
about the structure of these relationships. We invite users to share their
experience on the SEQanswers user forum (Li et al., 2012), available
through the crAss web site, and let future users know which distance
formula they found useful or useless for their particular application.

2.3 Real data

To illustrate the use of crAss for reference-independent comparative
metagenomics, we selected three sets of viral metagenomes sequenced
using the GS FLX system (Lopez-Bueno et al., 2009; Nakamura et al.,
2009; Rosario et al., 2009). We used viral metagenomes because they are
more challenging than microbial metagenomes because of the high di-
versity and large fraction of unknown sequences. Table 1 shows the 15
samples from these publications that we used as test data for crAss. All
reads were preprocessed using a pipeline including cross_match (http://
www.phrap.org/) to remove possible vector contamination, TagCleaner
(Schmieder et al., 2010) to remove sequencing tags, PRINSEQ
(Schmieder and Edwards, 2011b) to filter low quality, short and dupli-
cate sequences and DeconSeq (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011a) to
remove human-like sequence contamination. The details of the prepro-
cessing pipeline are available at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/mymgdb/. We
then combined the 15 datasets into a single cross-assembly using
gsAssembler 2.6 (Margulies et al., 2005) with default parameters.
Finally, we uploaded the individual raw reads files, as well as the
ACE file resulting from the assembly, to the crAss web server to pro-
duce the presented results.

2.4 Simulated data

We tested the performance of the different distance formulas in crAss
using simulated metagenomic samples created from completely sequenced
bacterial genomes. Genomes between 2 and 6 Mb in length representing
the phyla Actinobacteria (n = 77), Firmicutes (n = 154) and Proteobacteria
(n=280) were selected from RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2012), choosing one
genome per species to avoid redundancy (Supplementary File 1). We then

created several sets of simulated metagenomes using Grinder 0.4.5 (Angly
et al., 2012) with realistic pyrosequencing parameters: read
length=450:|:100 nt, and 2% sequencing errors, of which 85% were
substitutions and 15% were indels; homopolymeric errors were included
according to the Balzer model (Balzer et al., 2011).

Three experiments were carried out (Supplementary File 1). First, we
investigated the effect of decreasing species overlap by creating 32 simu-
lated metagenomes of 30 species each. Samples ov00 and ov01 contained
the same thirty Firmicutes, and in every subsequent sample (ov02iov31),
we randomly replaced one of the Firmicutes by a Proteobacterium. Each
sample was cross-assembled with ov00 to determine how the similarity
score depends on the species overlap.

Second, we investigated the effect of varying species abundance. We
created ten simulated metagenomes containing the same 10 Firmicutes
genomes, but with different logarithmic species distributions (in five
pairs, see Supplementary File 1). These 10 samples were cross-assembled
together.

Third, we investigated the sensitivity for detecting similar (but not the
same) species (either Actinobacteria or Firmicutes) against a background
of noise from a third phylum (Proteobacteria). We created 11 sets of
samples, each consisting of nine metagenomes. Three of those contained
25 or 26 randomly selected (but different) Actinobacteria, and six
contained 25 or 26 Firmicutes. Within these metagenomes, the
Actinobacteria or Firmicutes ‘signal’ was contaminated with an increasing
percentage of Proteobacteria ‘noise’, sampled uniformly from the 280
genomes. The species distributions in all these samples are described in
Supplementary File 1, and the results from these experiments are pre-
sented in Supplementary File 2.

2.5 Short k-mer proﬁles

Short k-mer profiles have previously been used as an alternative approach
for reference-independent comparative metagenomics, where a length of
k=2 was shown to yield the best separation (Willner et al., 2009).
Distances dilf between metagenomes i and j were calculated from k-mer
profiles as:

2.6 Reference mapping

We compared the performance of crAss with a reference mapping ana-
lysis. All reads were queried by blastn 2.2.25+ (Camacho et 01., 2009)
(default parameters, E—value 50.001) to the Genbank non-redundant nu-
cleotide database (nt, October 19th, 2011) and assigned to the taxonomic
clade of their closest hit. Read counts were divided in case of draws and
iteratively summed for all parent clades as explained previously
(Trindade-Silva et 01., 2012). Distances between datasets were calculated
as one minus the correlation coefficient of the resulting taxonomic
distributions.

3 RESULTS

It is expected that metagenomes from a similar environment
share a larger fraction of microbial or viral species than meta—
genomes from different origins. These shared ‘metagenomic enti—
ties’ can be reconstructed by cross—assembly of the metagenomes
and analyzed and visualized using crAss. The contigs that link
two samples (cross—contigs) directly represent the similarity be—
tween those samples. If most contigs are composed of a mix of
reads from different samples, then it may be concluded that there
are many shared entities among those samples. Conversely, if
contigs are predominantly composed of reads from either one
of the samples, but there are few cross—contigs, these samples are
highly dissimilar in composition.

3.1 Simulation experiments

To evaluate the performance of each of the distance formulas
and compare cross—assembly with existing approached for com—
parative metagenomics, we created several simulated metagen—
omes by sampling reads from completely sequenced bacterial
genomes (Supplementary File 1).

First, we investigated a sequence of samples with decreasing
species overlap by creating 31 simulated datasets of 30 species
each (ov0170v31); the first contained 30 Firmicutes, and one of
those was replaced by a Proteobacterium in each subsequent
dataset. Each of these was cross—assembled with another dataset
of 30 Firmicutes (ov00, which was sampled from the same species
as ov01, see Supplementary File 1). As shown in Figure 1, the
distance to sample ov00 decreases with increasing species overlap
for all distance formulas. As a result of the assembly parameters
in Newbler, which are optimized for complete genome assembly,
the curves show a non—linear response of the distance score to the
degree of species overlap. For comparison, the second tab in
Supplementary File 2 shows MIRA (Chevreux et al., 2004)
assemblies optimized for either complete genomes (tries to
build long contigs) or ESTs (allows shorter fragments), which
shows a more linear response. Indeed, the EST parameters
might be more appropriate for metagenome assembly as well.

Second, we investigated the effect of varying species abun—
dance by creating ﬁve pairs of simulated metagenomic samples
with different logarithmically distributed species abundances

Fig. 1. Distance between 31 simulated metagenomic samples with
increasing species overlap, and simulated sample ov00 (see
Supplementary File 1 for species distributions). Distances were calculated
using the four crAss distance formulas; the fifth line shows the distance
based on dinucleotide odds ratios (W illner et 01., 2009). See Section 2 for
details

(see Supplementary File 1 for species distributions). As shown
in Supplementary Figure S1, all distance formulas cluster the
correct sample pairs together. Interestingly, the quantitative dis—
tance formula ‘Wootters’ [Equation (3)], as well as the dinucleo—
tide odds ratios (Willner et al., 2009), captures the connection
between the clusters (ab03, ab04) and (ab05, ab06), which both
have the highest fraction of Bacillus weihenstephanensis KBAB4
reads (70%, see Supplementary File 1), and subsequently cluster
(ab07, ab08), with 21% B.weihenstephanensis KBAB4 reads. In
contrast, the qualitative distance formulas ‘SHOT’ [Equation (1)]
and ‘minimum’ [Equation (2)] do not capture these connections,
nor does the ‘reads’ formula [Equation (4)].

Third, we evaluated the sensitivity of crAss for detecting dif—
ferent species from the same phylum in the face of increasing
levels of noise. Simulated metagenomic samples were created
from the complete genomes of 511 species (see Supplementary
File 1 for species distributions). Three metagenomes contained
25 or 26 different Actinobacteria each, and six metagenomes con—
tained 25 or 26 different Firmicutes each. These nine datasets
were contaminated with 07100% noise in the form of simulated
reads from Proteobacteria genomes. The results of this analysis
show that crAss can separate the Actinobacteria from the
Firmicutes metagenomes, with up to 80% Proteobacteria con—
tamination (70% for the distance formula ‘minimum’, see Fig.
2). As expected, the approach based on dinucleotide odds ratios
also separates Firmicutes (also known as low G+ C
gram—positive bacteria) from Actinobacteria (or high G+ C
gram—positive bacteria), even when contaminated with up to a
90% Proteobacteria reads.

To summarize, crAss clusters metagenomes containing differ—
ent species from the same phylum in the face of high levels of
noise derived from identical contaminating species sets.
Moreover, the length of the branch that separates these groups
decreases with the decrease in signal for all distance formulas
(Fig. 2), showing that crAss can sensitively identify the degree
of similarity between samples.

Fig. 4. Cladogram representing the distance between metagenomes based
on the fraction of cross-assembled contigs between all sample pairs. crAss
creates this cladogram from a distance matrix using BioNJ (Gascuel,
1997) and visualizes it using Drawtree (Felsenstein, 1989). This cladogram
was based on Equation (1). The complete output for this dataset, includ-
ing distance matrices and cladograms based on the other distance for-
mulas, can be retrieved at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/crass/ under Job ID

not depend on homology of the sequenced reads to any known
sequence in a reference database, or even on full—length hom—
ology of the reads to one another. Assembly algorithms, such
as those used to create the ACE ﬁles required for crAss analysis,
identify shared subsequences (long or signature k—mers) between
reads to assemble them (Li et al., 2011). Because it relies on a
different similarity signal, this long k—mer approach is comple—
mentary to the use of short k—mer proﬁles (Ghosh et al., 2011;
Willner et al., 2009).

We expect that Equations (1) and (2) can be applied for quali—
tative comparisons between environments because they only take
the degree of shared entities (cross—contigs) into account.
Conversely, Equations (3) and (4) will be more suited for quan—
titative comparisons because they consider the read counts as a
measure of abundance. Although limited in scope, our current
results based on analyses of simulated metagenomic samples sug—
gest that the distance formula ‘Wootters’ [Equation (3)] may
outperform the other formulas for detecting both qualitative
and quantitative signals, with similar performance as the com—
parisons based on dinucleotide odds ratios (W illner et al., 2009).
Nevertheless, it is difficult to predict which of the distance for—
mulas presented in this article will be the most suitable for which
biological application. That is why we have created a user forum
at SEQanswers (Li et al., 2012), available through the crAss web
site, where we hope that users will share their experiences and
any publications that use crAss.

An additional advantage of using cross—assembly is that the
sequences of biological entities, which are shared between speciﬁc
samples, are simultaneously assembled. Based on the results

obtained using simulated data (Supplementary File 2), we
expect that fragment assemblers developed for ESTs, such as
MIRA, or specialized metagenome assemblers will be more suit—
able for cross—metagenome assembly than assemblers like
Newbler, which are optimized for single—genome assembly.

If the parameters of the assembly program are set to strict
values to avoid chimerization, tentative taxonomic annotations
may be transferred between reads that are linked within one
contig. We recommend using parameter settings that the user
is comfortable with for metagenomic assembly, but it should
be noted that the resulting crAss cladogram is based on a simi—
larity score between entire metagenomes, which limits the effect
of possibly rare chimerical sequences. Moreover, chimerization
may be problematic between closely related species, but less
severe for more distant organisms. Thus, although they will
add some noise to the similarity signal, chimeras are more
likely to link reads from biomes that are already similar, alleviat—
ing errors in the ﬁnal cladogram. To address the issue of poten—
tial chimerization, we recommend creating separate
cross—assemblies and crAss cladograms with stringent and per—
missive assembly parameters, which will lead to fewer and more
chimerical contigs, respectively. The resulting cladograms can
then be compared to evaluate the effect of chimerization on
the cross—assembly analysis. In general, we have seen that the
cladogram rarely changes with altered assembly parameters, indi—
cating that crAss is a robust approach for comparative
metagenomics.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Microbial community profiling is a highly active area
of research, but tools that facilitate visualization of phylogenetic
trees and associated environmental data have not kept up with the
increasing quantity of data generated in these studies.

Results: TopiaryExplorer supports the visualization of very large
phylogenetic trees, including features such as the automated
coloring of branches by environmental data, manipulation of trees
and incorporation of per-tip metadata (e.g. taxonomic labels).

1 INTRODUCTION

Microbial community proﬁling using marker genes such as the
165 rRNA greatly expanded our knowledge of the diversity of
the microbial world (Tringe and Hugenholtz, 2008). Phylogenetic
trees are key to our understanding of the microbial world (Pace,
1997), and provide an important view into microbial data (Ludwig
et (11., 2004). Software such as QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010) has
kept pace with the increasing rate of sequence acquisition to allow
statistical analysis of these data, but tools to visualize and manipulate
phylogenetic trees and corresponding metadata (Huson et (11.,
2007; Letunic and Bork, 2011; www.phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx;
http://tree.bio.ed.aC.uk/software/ﬁgtree), which worked well on
datasets that were Characteristic a few years ago, are less suitable
for datasets containing millions of sequences.

A key question in microbial ecology is which portions of a
phylogenetic reference tree are differentially represented in speciﬁc
groups of samples. To address this question, users should be able
to load trees with thousands of tips, assign taxonomic labels to the
tips, and color the branches based on data about each sample.

Here we present TopiaryExplorer, a software package that
facilitates visual exploration of large phylogenetic trees, including
information about each sample and each tip. This integration of
what is often called ‘sequence metadata’ is crucial to understanding
how sequences (and their source organisms) are distributed across

environments, and the processes underlying the observed patterns.
TopiaryExplorer additionally allows display and revision of the
taxonomy (including multiple taxonomies for the same tree,
facilitating taxonomic comparisons), and integration with databases
that contain sample/tree information (an example database is
provided to assist users in creating their own: see below). It also
provides key user interface improvements including: the ability
to dynamically collapse or expand the whole tree using several
different tree layout algorithms, allowing rapid visual exploration
of which lineages are shared among or unique to speciﬁc subsets of
environments; the ability to spawn new windows for investigation of
speciﬁc subtrees and to View multiple trees at the same time; control
over labels and layout features critical for producing publication-
quality graphics; the ability to export results in any of several
graphical and machine-readable formats for further analysis; and the
ability to handle datasets of hundreds of thousands of tips, which
can easily be created from larger datasets by OTU picking with
UCLUST (Edgar, 2010) or related tools. TopiaryExplorer metadata
is provided as tab-separated text, and trees are provided as Newick-
formatted strings. These standard ﬁle formats allow data generated
with different tools to be easily imported into TopiaryExplorer.

TopiaryExplorer is written in Java using Processing, which allows
for rapid tree visualization and PDF export using OpenGL. The tree
layout rendering algorithms in TopiaryExplorer were adapted from
PyCogent (Knight et al., 2007). Several strategies were applied to
efﬁciently visualize large trees and associated metadata, including
caching node lookups rather than running multiple lookups of the
same node, and using sparse table representations for storing and
accessing metadata.

2 RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

To illustrate the utility of TopiaryExplorer we applied it to a
microbial survey of the hands and keyboards of three individuals
(Fierer et al., 2010). This study illustrated how individuals can be
matched to objects they have touched through the use of ‘microbial
ﬁngerprints’. It has previously been difﬁcult to identify the speciﬁc
taxonomic differences between the hand or keyboard microbial
communities from different individuals.

We applied TopiaryExplorer to speciﬁcally address this question
and ﬁnd that between-community taxonomic differences are present
and easily discemable (Fig. lA—D). The trees visually represent the

results of the original study, that M3’s keyboard is more similar
to M3’s ﬁngertips than the ﬁngertips of either M2 or M9, but
additionally allows us to immediately determine which taxonomic
groups are differentially represented in the different sample types.
For example, M3’s ﬁngertips and keyboard contain Proteobacteria in
higher abundance than M2 or M9. Figure 1E represents a screenshot
of the TopiaryExplorer interface.

These results show how visual inspection of phylogenetic trees
with environmental data can facilitate interpretation of the relative
differences between microbial communities. TopiaryExplorer ﬁlls a
necessary gap in tools for the comparison of microbial communities.
The tree of life is being rapidly ﬁlled by large-scale projects such
as Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA), the
Human Microbiome Project and the Earth Microbiome Project and
annotated with emerging standards such as Minimum Information
about any Sequence (MIxS). The ability to determine what lineages
are novel in a new dataset, and what lineages distinguish among
samples associated with Clinical or environmental parameters, will
be crucial for understanding the ecology and evolution of the
microbes that comprise the vast majority of life on earth.

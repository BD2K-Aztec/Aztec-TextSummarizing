2 METHODS
2.1 1D features

2.1.] Conservation of a residue—position The conservation measure
JSD(k) (Fischer et al., 2008) has performed better than other conserva-
tion measures (see Capra and Singh, 2007) and was computed for a resi-
due-position k according to

obs _ flmckgr 1 V 1 H
150(k) = H( K 2 )—§H(f%”“ —§H(f”““gr) (1)
ﬂ!" is the probability mass function for site k approximated as
f’l’l""(aai) = f,‘.(aa,») by the amino acid frequencies observed in the respect-
ive column k of the MSA; the mean amino acid frequencies as found in
the SwissProt database (Bairoch and preiler, 2000) were taken as back-
ground frequencies fl’mg’. H(.) is Shannon’s entropy (Shannon, 1948).
For classification, we used the z-score cons/90¢):

Mean ulgD and standard deviation (USD values were determined individu-
ally for each MSA.

2.1.2 Conservation of a sequence neighborhood To characterize the
conservation of a sequence neighborhood, cons,,(,,-;7(k) was computed in
analogy to Fischer et a]. (2008):

positions. The weights were wzl = w“ = 3, wzz = w+2 = 2, wz3 = w+3 = l.
The conservation of position k did not contribute to cons,,(,,-;7(k).

2.1.3 Propensities of catalytic sites, ligand—binding sites and posi—

tions important for structure Inspired by Bartlett et al. (2002), three
scores named abund(k, CLASS) were computed:

2° fLASSma»

abund(k, CLASS) = fk(aa,») MW

f’“""’g’(aai) were the above background frequencies, and fCLASS(aa,») were

the frequencies of residues from one set CLASS e{CA T_sites, LIG_sites,

S TRUC_sites}. For the analysis of a single sequence with CLIPS-3D (see

later in the text), fk(aa,») was 1.0 for aaﬁ‘j and zero for all other residues.

2.1.4 Scoring propensities of a neighborhood To assess the class-
specific neighborhood of a site k, we introduced

ffff‘SSMailaax) is the conditional frequency of aa, at the same positional
offset deduced from the neighborhood of all residues aas of a set CLASS.
Neib is the :|:3 neighborhood.

2.2 3D Features

2.2.1 Conservation of a 3D neighborhood To characterize the con-
servation of a 3D neighborhood of a residue oak in a protein,
3D — con.s,m1,(k) was computed in analogy to Formula (3):

l

[ESDiNc/ib

3D-Neib is the set of all residues aa, in the vicinity of k possessing an
alarm such that the distance between van der Waals spheres of at least
one pair of sidechain heavy atoms (atomr, atoms) with atom, from oak is at
most 0.5 A. cons/9(1) is a normalized Jensenishannon divergence; see
Formula (2).

2.2.2 Scoring propensities of a 3D neighborhood To assess the
class-speciﬁc 3D neighborhood, we introduced

Here, aaﬁ‘j is the amino acid aas occurring at site k under consideration,
f[(aa,») is the frequency of go, at position I, and ffLASSmailaax) is the
conditional frequency of aa, deduced from the neighborhood of all resi-
dues aas of a set CLASS. The set 3D-Neib was determined as previously
mentioned.

2.2.3 Mutual information score of a 3D neighborhood As pro-
posed (Buslje et al., 2010), we determined a proximity score pMI,
which assesses the mutual information of pairs of residue-positions in
the vicinity of k.

pMI(k) = Z cMI(l) (8)

cMI(l) is a cumulative mutual information value (see Buslje et al., 2010),
and 3D-Neib was determined as previously mentioned.

2.2.4 Assessing the B—factor of a residue In analogy to Petrova and
Wu (2006), a normalized B-factor BF(k) was computed.

and uBFmam and oBme, are the mean and the standard-deviation deter-
mined individually for each 3D structure.

2.2.5 Computing the relative solvent—accessible surface
area Using the software library BALL (Hildebrandt et al., 2010), the
solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) was deduced from the protein 3D
structure for each residue oak to compute the relative SASA (rSASA).

Here, SASA,,,,L\.(aak) is the maximally possible SASA (Miller et al., 1987)
of the amino acid.

2.2.6 Assessing pockets As has been shown, fpocket (Le Guilloux
et al., 2009) is one of the best methods for the identification of pockets in
proteins (Volkamer et al., 2010). fpocket scores cavities of the protein
surface based on a Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres. To compen-
sate for the protein-specific number of pockets, we determined a normal-
ized score nPocket.

(12)
max(PocketScore) is the largest score deduced for any pocket of the con-
sidered protein, and PocketScore(aak) is the score of the pocket in which
oak is allocated. We assigned a score of —l to all residues that did not
belong to pockets or whose rSASA value was <4%.

performance of a classiﬁcation, the rates Sensitivity (Recall), Speciﬁcity

and Precision

were determined as well as areas under the precision-recall curve

(PR-AUC). As a further performance measure, the Matthews correlation

coefﬁcient (MCC) has been introduced (Matthews, 1975).

MCC-values are considered a fair measure to assess performance on
unbalanced sets of positives and negatives (Ezkurdia et al., 2009), as
observed here. In all formulae, TP is the number of true positives, TN
the number of true negatives, FP the number of false positives, and FN
the number of false negatives. For example, when classifying catalytic
sites, positives are the selected CAT_sites, and negatives are all other
residue-positions of the considered MSAs.

2.2.8 Classifying by means of S VMs CLIPS-4D was conﬁgured
and trained as described for CLIPS-1D (Janda et al., 2012). We used
the libsvm library (Chang and Lin, 2011) with a Gaussian radial basis
function kernel and determined optimal parameters yRBF and C during
training by means of a grid search (Scholkopf and Smola, 2002). Training
and assessment was organized as an 8-fold cross validation. For each
training step, the number of positive and negative cases was balanced.
To eliminate sampling bias during the grid search, all parameters were
deduced as means from training trials with the same positives and 50
different randomly selected sets of negative cases. In contrast to training,
all positive and all negative cases were classiﬁed to compute performance
measures (e. g. MCC-values). The output of the MC-SVM consists of four
class-probabilities pCLASS (see Wu et al., 2004) for each residue-position.
Each residue-positions k was assigned to the class, whose pCLASS-value
was largest. P-values were determined as follows: For each class and each
residue, the respective cumulative distribution was deduced from the
pCLASS-values of residue-positions l belonging to NOANN_sites. That
is, the P-value for a Glu-residue with pSTRl/Cmvalue s(k) is the fraction
of all Glu-residues from NOANN_sites reaching or surpassing s(k).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Selecting an optimal combination of 1D and
3D features

For training and testing SVMs on a combination of 1D and 3D
features, we used the set of MSAs prepared for CLIPS—1D
(Janda et al., 2012) and supplemented the respective pdb—ﬁles
(Dutta et al., 2009). In brief, all MSAs were taken from the
HSSP database (Sander and Schneider, 1991), and each resi—
due—position was assigned to one of four sets (classes) represent—
ing functional categories. The set CAT_sites consists of 840
catalytic residue—positions, which are listed in the manually
curated part of the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA, Version 2.2.12)
(Porter et al., 2004) and come from 264 enzymes. For 216 of
these enzymes, we found 4466 ligand—binding sites in the
pdbsum database (Laskowski et al., 2005b), which constitute
the dataset LIG_sites. Owing to the lack of a representative set
of proteins, which are annotated with structurally important resi—
due—positions, we regarded conserved residues in the core of pro—
teins important for structure. Thus, we have handpicked 136
proteins without enzymatic function and identiﬁed 3703

residue—positions, which were both buried and more conserved
than the mean; see Janda et al. (2012). This set was named
S T RU C_sites; the remaining 19 223 residue—positions were
named NOANN_sites and represented residue—positions without
crucial function. During training and testing, residue—positions
from one set CLASS 6 { CAT _sites, LIG_sites, ST RUC_sites }
and from NOANN_sites served as positive or negative cases to
train six two—class SVMs; for details, see Janda et al. (2012).

For CLIPS—1D, we have chosen seven sequence—based features
for classiﬁcation: consJSD(k) [Formula (2)] assesses the conserva—
tion of individual residue—positions and consneibUc) [Formula (3)]
assesses the conservation of their neighborhood. abund(k, CLASS)
[Formula (4)] scores the abundance of residues at functionally or
structurally important sites and abundneihUc, CA T _sites) and
abundneihUc, LIG_sites) [Formula (5)] score the composition in
the neighborhood of functionally important sites.

To this end, six more features, which require a 3D structure for
their computation, were selected as candidates for a combination
with the aforementioned sequence—based features. Two are 3D
versions of sequence—based conservation scores: 3D — consmbUc)
[Formula (6)] scores the conservation of residues in the 3D neigh—
borhood of residue—position k and 3D — abundmib(aaf, CLASS)
assesses the class—speciﬁc abundance of residues in the 3D neigh—
borhood of amino acid aax at position k [Formula (7)]. pMI(k)
[Formula (8)] scores dependencies of residue distributions in the
vicinity of residue k and has been reported as improving the
prediction of catalytic sites (Buslje et al., 2010). The biochemical
role of a residue may affect its ﬂexibility, which can be estimated
with the mean B—factor 817(k) (Petrova and Wu, 2006) computed
according to Formula (9). The relative solvent accessible surface
area rSASA(k) [Formula (11)] allows for the differentiation of
surface and core residues. Catalytic and ligand—binding sites tend
to lie in surface pockets (Volkamer et al., 2010); thus, we used
the normalized score nPocket(k) according to Formula (12) as a
further feature.

Before finding an optimal combination of features, we were
interested to corroborate the contribution of evolutionary infor—
mation and of 3D data to classiﬁcation quality. Thus, we
combined those features that do not require an MSA for classi—
ﬁcation and named the resulting MC—SVM CLIPS—3D. We chose
abund(k, CLASS), which scores the abundance of residues in
functionally or structurally important sites (Janda et al., 2012),
and the 3D features 3D — abundmib(aaf, CLASS), rSASA(k) and
nPocket(k). CLIPS—3D was trained and assessed by means of an
8—fold cross validation on the aforementioned classes. The output
of this and all other MC—SVMs of the CLIPS—suite is for each
residue—position a set of four class probabilities pCLASSUc)
(Wu et al., 2004), which were taken to assign k to the class
with the highest probability.

Generally, it is difﬁcult to characterize the performance of a
classiﬁer, if the number of positive and negative cases is highly
unbalanced as is also the case here. A fair measure (Ezkurdia
et al., 2009) is the MCC [Formula (14)], which was computed for
all analyses; see Table 1. Comparing the MCC—values of CLIPS—
1D and CLIPS—3D shows that evolutionary information is
important to predict CA T _sites and S T RU C_sites, and that 3D
data contribute markedly to the prediction of LIG_sites.

Next, we combined each of the aforementioned 3D features and
all CLIPS—1D features to train and assess six different MC—SVMs

 

3031

analogously. The comparison with MCC—values of CLIPS—1D
made clear that only rSASA and nPocket improved classiﬁcation
performance and that the classiﬁcation of LIG_sites proﬁted most
by the latter two features (Table 1). Further performance tests
showed that the assessment of a residue’s neighborhood in 3D
space did not outperform the respective 1D features. Thus, we
combined the seven sequenced—based features of CLIPS—1D with
rSASA and nPocket to form the classiﬁer CLIPS—4D. Compared
with CLIPS—1D, the MCC—values increased from 0.34 to 0.43 for
CAT _sites, from 0.12 to 0.27 for LIG_sites and from 0.67 to 0.68
for ST RUC_sites. As the respective MCC—value was optimal, if
CAT _sites with pCA7(k)>O.64 were selected as positives, we im—
plemented this cutoff for functional assignment. For the output of
CLIPS—4D, we additionally determined a residue—speciﬁc P—value,
which indicates the fraction of N 0ANN_sites reaching or surpass—
ing the considered pCLASyvalue (see Section 2.2.8). Using P—
values in the range of 0.014120 as cutoffs, MCC—values as well
as Sensitivity (Recall), Speciﬁcity and Precision [Formulae (13)]
of CLIPS—4D were determined (Table 2 and Supplementary

Table 1. MCC-values of classiﬁers for crucial residue-positions

CLIPS-4D 0.43 0.27 0.68
ConSurf 0.30 0.46

 

Note: For all variants of the CLIPS classiﬁer, MCC—values for the classiﬁcation of
CAT_sites, LIG_sites and STRUC_sites are listed. CLIPS—3D is based on seven
propensities 0r structure—based features, which do not require an MSA for compu—
tation, and CLIPS—1D uses seven sequence-based features. Each of the lines labeled
3D — cons/SD, 3D — abundngm, pMI, BF, rSASA and nPocket gives the performance
of an MC—SVM exploiting the seven CLIPS—1D features plus the listed 3D feature.
CLIPS—4D is a classiﬁer using the seven CLIPS—1D features plus rSASA and nPocket.
The classiﬁer ConSurf does not distinguish catalytic and ligand—binding sites.
Therefore, we merged the sets CA T_sites and LIG_sites before classiﬁcation.

Fig. Sl). MCC—values of CA T _sites and LIG_sites reached a plat—
eau for P 3 0.05. Thus, we recommend the P—value of 0.05 for the
selection of functional sites, as sensitivity is acceptable and speci—
ﬁcity is then as high as 0.99, 0.95 and 0.96 for CAT _sites,
LIG_sites and S T RU C_sites; compare Table 2.

In summary, the final configuration of CLIPS—4D is an
MC—SVM, which classiﬁes based on nine features. These are
the seven sequence—based features consneibUc), abund(k, CLASS)
and abundmib(aaf, CLASS), plus the two 3D features rSASA(k)
and nPocket(k). CLIPS—4D is available as a web service at http://
www—bioinf.uni—regensburg.de; this version was trained on the
full datasets. An assessment of typical output is provided as
Supplementary Data.

3.2 Classiﬁcation performance of CLIPS-4D varies in a
class- and residue-speciﬁc manner

Owing to their biochemical properties, residues are not evenly
distributed at functionally or structurally important positions.
For example, only 11 residues are generally observed as being
directly involved in catalysis (Bartlett et al., 2002), and few resi—
dues are overrepresented at catalytic sites. The charged residues
Lys, Glu, Arg, Asp and His as well as Cys are the only residues
with an abund(k, CAT _sites)—value>0.5, whereas Pro and the
hydrophobic residues Val, Ile, Lou and Ala are scored<—2.0,
i.e. are drastically underrepresented. To characterize classiﬁcation
performance in detail, we determined in a class—speciﬁc manner
MCC—values for each individual residue. In Figure 1, these MCC—
values were plotted versus abundance scores. For CA T _sites, all of
the overrepresented residues were classiﬁed with an MCC—
value>0.33. In contrast, the underrepresented residues Ala, Gly
and Phe had an MCC—value of zero; no MCC—value could be
computed for the underrepresented residues Pro, Val, Ile, Lou
and Met due to missing values. The abund(k, LIG_sites)—scores
were less extreme, indicating that more types of residues are
involved in ligand—binding than in catalysis. MCC—values were
lowest (<0.13) for the underrepresented residues Glu and Lys
but also for the overrepresented residues Asp, Arg and His.
These three residues were also observed as CAT_sites, which
might explain why some ligand—binding sites were misclassiﬁed
as catalytic ones. Among ST RUC_sites, the MCC—values were
generally higher (mean 0.63) and for the hydrophobic residues
Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Tyr and Trp the mean was 0.73.

by a lower performance (MCC—value of ~0.5 for best—performing
methods) on CASP9 target T0604 (Schmidt et al., 2011).
Additionally, substrates tend not to be crystallized in proteins,
and their binding residues are more family speciﬁc. Thus, we
hypothesized that CLIPS—4D might supplement homology trans—
fer by predicting additional residues that bind substrates or non—
metal ligands.

First, we conﬁrmed that CLIPS—4D predictions help to iden—
tify substrate or product binding sites of the enzymes IGPS
(1A53), LgtC (1G9R), HIT (1KPF) and TIM (1M7P); pdb ids
are given in brackets. In each of these and the following cases,
the sets CAT _sites and LIG_sites were merged before assessing
in a CASP—related manner the performance for residues bind—
ing non—metal ligands. A detailed analysis was added as
Supplementary Data.

Second, we compared the outcome of CLIPS—4D and firestar
(Lopez et al., 2011), a top—performing method, for those cases of
CASP9 where the MCC—value of the best—performing participant
of the contest was lowest (Schmidt et al., 2011). We selected five
targets with a non—metal ligand, namely, T0526, T0584, T0604,
T0615 and T0632. Owing to the lack of sufﬁciently large MSAs
or unavailable 3D structures, we could only analyze one non—
metal target of CASPlO, namely T0721. Results were summar—
ized in Table 3 and listed as Supplementary Data. In two of the
six cases (T0526, T0604), the MCC—value of CLIPS—4D was
superior to firestar. A union of the predictions generated by
firestar and CLIPS—4D gave in comparison with firestar for
two more cases (T0615, T0721) a higher sensitivity at the cost
of a moderate loss in speciﬁcity.

Among these six CASP targets, the performance of CLIPS—4D
was worst for T0584 (pdb id 3NF2). T0584 is a polyprenyl trans—
ferase generating the product from the building blocks isopente—
nyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by
consecutive steps of elongation, cyclopropagation, rearrange—
ment and cyclization reactions (Wallrapp et al., 2013). During
synthesis, the product grows into an elongation cavity, and mu—
tagenesis studies made clear that residues protruding into the

elongation cavity determine the length of the product (Liang
et al., 2002). Two pairs of aspartates of Asp—rich regions are
involved in binding DMAPP and catalysis via chelation of the
cofactor Mg2+. Five residues from these Asp—rich regions shown
to be important for catalysis (Liang et al., 2002) were predicted
by CLIPS—4D as CAT_sites. Four of these residues are not
directly involved in ligand binding in the experimental control
structure 1RQI and are thus false—positive predictions as well as
41 LIG_sites. Of these, 18 line the elongation cavity modeled
previously (Tarshis et al., 1996). Three more LIG_sites most
likely contact the ligand after an active site rearrangement; see
Supplementary Data for details. Therefore, experimental evi—
dence makes plausible some of these predictions that do not
belong to the extended binding site.

Thus, although not representative due to the small number
of analyses, these findings suggest to supplement the result of
homology transfer with CLIPS—4D predictions in cases of active
site rearrangements, ﬂexible substrates or unknown poses of a
ligand.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The combination of evolutionary and 3D data allows CLIPS—4D
to predict critical residue—positions with state—of—the—art quality.
As shown here, not more than nine features are sufﬁcient to
reach state—of—the—art classiﬁcation performance, if features are
orthogonal to each other. The sequence— and structure—based
features contribute differently to the identiﬁcation of func—
tionally and structurally important residue—positions: For the
identiﬁcation of catalytic and structurally important sites, se—
quence—based features like conservation are most relevant, for
ligand—binding sites 3D features indicating a position in a surface
pocket contribute markedly to classiﬁcation quality. Assessing
the content of the CSA made clear that those residues, which
were frequently found at catalytic sites could be identiﬁed with
high quality. In contrast, the identiﬁcation of residues, which are
rare at catalytic sites, and those of ligand—binding sites is still a

difficult problem. CLIPS—4D identifies biologically relevant resi—
due—positions and can supplement methods of homology
transfer.

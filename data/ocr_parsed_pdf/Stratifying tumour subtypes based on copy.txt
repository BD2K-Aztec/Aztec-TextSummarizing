Abstract

Motivation: The role of personalized medicine and target treatment in the clinical management
of cancer patients has become increasingly important in recent years. This has made the task of
precise histological substratification of cancers crucial. Increasingly, genomic data are being
seen as a valuable classifier. Specifically, copy number alteration (CNA) profiles generated by next—
generation sequencing (NGS) can become a determinant fortumours subtyping. The principle pur—
pose of this study is to devise a model with good prediction capability for the tumours histological
subtypes as a function of both the patients covariates and their genome—wide CNA profiles from
NGS data.

Results: We investigate a logistic regression for modelling tumour histological subtypes as a func—
tion ofthe patients’ covariates and their CNA profiles, in a mixed model framework. The covariates,
such as age and gender, are considered as fixed predictors and the genome—wide CNA profiles are
considered as random predictors. We illustrate the application ofthis model in lung and oral cancer
datasets, and the results indicate that the tumour histological subtypes can be modelled with a
good fit. Our cross—validation indicates that the logistic regression exhibits the best prediction rela—
tive to other classification methods we considered in this study. The model also exhibits the best
agreement in the prediction between smooth—segmented and circular binary—segmented CNA
profiles.

(ii) age and gender as covariates and (iii) the CNA estimates across
17571 genomic windows. To model the binary histological subtype,
logistic regression is a natural choice because we can extend the
standard model to deal with the second type of predictors namely
CNA profiles. One of the immediate challenges dealing with this
type of data is the dimension of the CNA profiles. We have a data
matrix of size n X q where 76 : 11 < q : 17 571. A standard logistic
regression will fail in the computation because the number of vari—
ables far exceeds the number of observations. To proceed, we extend
the standard model by assuming that the parameters of CNA to fol—
low a Normal distribution.

Specifically, in vector notation, consider 3/ as a vector of binary
tumour histology with 31,: 1 if the tumour is squamous carcinoma
and 31,: 0 if the tumour is ADC, for i : 1, 2, . .. ,n. We assume that
3/ follow a Binomial(1,u) distribution with H is the probability of the
tumour being squamous carcinoma. In logistic regression, we model

h(H)=Xﬁ+Zv (1)
where  is a legit link function that applies elementwise, X is a
matrix of fixed covariates of size n X p, I} is a P—vector of fixed
effects for matrix X, Z is matrix of CNA estimates of size n X q, and
y is a q—vector of random effects for matrix Z. We assume that y),
j : 1, . . . ,q would follow a Normal(0,tz) distribution.
The joint log likelihood of the parameters is given by

10g LUV/712) = log 17(ylv) +10g 170) (2)

where p(y(y) is the likelihood based on conditional distribution of 3/
given y, and p(y) is the likelihood based on the Normal distribution
of random effects y. Given the data 311,312, . . . ,3)”, the log likelihood

is given by

The estimation of I} and y in (3) can be performed using iterative
weighted least squares (IWLSs) at a fixed value of /1. At a fixed value
of /l and starting values of [30 and yo, IWLS is performed to find the
solution of mixed model equation

V0174)

2. calculate W“) : (Z’Z‘1Z + D‘1)_1Z’2_1Y

3. calculate [30“) : (X’2_1X)_1X’2_1Y

where in steps (2) and (3) we use the current values of 2 and Y. We
iterate the above steps until convergence and, at convergence,

we obtain the estimates if and «y. The dimension of matrix
(Z’Z‘FlZ + D‘l) is in the order of 17 571 X 17571 so that its inver—
sion is a computational bottle neck in the iteration. To overcome
this problem, we use a computational modification that are dis—
cussed further in Section 2.4.

The approximate standard errors for if and «p are given by the
square root of the diagonal of

(X’s—50‘1 (5)
and
(Z’E‘lz + D‘b‘ﬁ (6)

respectively, where S : Z + IZZZ’.

2.3.2 Estimation of 1:2 given If and y

We estimate [3 and y above at a given value of 1:2, and 1:2 can be esti—
mated as the one that minimizes Akaike’s Information Criterion
(AIC) or through cross—validation. The calculation of AIC in prac—
tice is described further in Section 2.4.

2.4 Computational consideration

The size of the matrix (Z’Z‘1Z + D‘l) involved in the above com—
putation is in the order of 17571 X 17571. To reduce the computa—
tional burden, we consider a modification of the computation to
find the solution of the above estimation problem. We can overcome
this problem by representing the matrix Z (of size n X q) as a multi—
plication of special matrices in singular value decomposition (SVD)
(Eilers et al., 2001 ). Let us define

Z: UQV’

where U and Q are of size n X n, and V is of size q X n, such that U’
U : In, V’V : 1,, (but VV’ 9E 14), and Q is a diagonal matrix of sin—
gular values of Z.

Using this decomposition, the relevant part in 4 can be rewritten as

((UQ)’2-1(UQ) + 214))" : (UQ)’2-1y (7)

where y : Vy". Based on this representation, the updating equation
in step (2) in the above iteration gives an update for y" (hence
also y), and at convergence we obtain the estimates if and 9 (via 9*).
The SVD is only done once before IWLS, as the quantities that are
updated in the above iteration are only YW), 2W), 13W) and W“) (via
WW). With this representation, the dimension of the matrix inver—
sion reduces dramatically from q >< q to a manageable n X n.
In the estimation of 1:2 (Section 2.3.2), we minimize the AIC

AIC : —2log L01) + 2df

where

L04) 2 Zmlog u,- + (1 — yi)log (1 - W}

and it is calculated in a logistic function using if and 9 (via 9*). The
degrees of freedom is computed as

df=trace{((UQ)’>3‘1(UQ)+ 11)_1((UQ)’>3‘1(UQ)+ 11)}
(Pawitan, 2001).
2.5 Cross—validation

In building a logistic regression to model tumour histology, we
wanted to consider how well the model can be employed to make

ﬁm'sreumol‘ptho'sopcuuowtotq/ﬁdnq

A. G usnanto et al.

 

prediction of new observations. To obtain the prediction of the hist—
ology based on the CNA profiles, we performed a cross—validation.
We randomly split 11 observations into training set of size n, and val—
idation set of size 11,, (n, + 11,, : n) such that

yr X; Z;
31::  ,X::  ,Z::
ya X” Z,

The training set serves as the set by which we estimate the model
parameters If, and 9,. The estimates are then used in the validation
set to obtain model prediction

1. 2 I (Ir1 {va + 2.9,}205), (8)

where I equals one (squamous group) if the expression inside the
brackets is true, and zero (ADC group) otherwise.

From this prediction, we obtain how many tumour histologies in
the validation set are misclassified (classification error). Denoting y,
2 (m m ... my and, from (s) y, 2 (m m ... we we deﬁne
the classification error as

CE 2 :un 2 at). (9)
[2:1

We also calculate this error as percentages out of 11,, which are pre—
sented in the Supplementary Material.

In our application, we perform the cross—validation 100 times
where, out of 76 observations, 38 observations are randomly se—
lected to be in the training set and the remaining 38 observations are
in the validation set. To see whether the classification error obtained
by logistic regression is within a reasonable range, we need to
consider other classification methods in the cross—validation.
This enables us to get a better view of the performance of the logistic
regression model (Section 2.3) in the prediction of tumour histology.

Some classification models that we consider in the cross—
validation are: (i) k—nearest neighbour (KNN) with k : 1, . . . ,7, (ii)
diagonal—quadratic and diagonal—linear discriminant—analysis (DA),
(iii) partial least squares (PLSs), (iv) elastic net, (v) lasso, (vi)
neural network, (vii) support vector machines and (viii) smoothed
logistic regression [SLR, Huang et al. (2009)]. For this purpose, we
only use the CNA profiles based on the smooth and circular binary
segmentation (CBS), i.e. X, and X, are just vector of ones, and if, is
just an estimate of fixed intercept (from the training set). Note that
the elastic—net and lasso models are essentially logistic regression
with different penalties to the likelihood that that we describe in
Section 2.3. To avoid confusion, we reserve the term ‘logistic regres—
sion’ for the one we describe in Section 2.3. We use the terms ‘elas—
tic—net’ and ‘lasso’ to refer to the logistic regression with elastic net
and lasso penalties, and use the acronym ‘SLR’ to refer to the SLR.

2.6 Agreement in prediction between segmentation
methods
A concern that we have in the analysis is whether the choice of seg—
mentation method that we use to estimate CNA really does deter—
mine whether a patient’s tumour histology is misclassified or not,
given a classification model. In other words, if a patient’s tumour is
predicted as ADC based on smooth—segmented CNA, is it also pre—
dicted as ADC based on CBS—segmented CNA? To answer this ques—
tion, we also estimate the agreement in prediction between these
two very different segmentation methods.

Let us denote Z5 and Zd as CNA profiles based on the smooth
and CBS segmentation, respectively. Let us also denote  and 1}? to

be the fixed and random parameter estimates from the training set
using CNA profiles based on smooth segmentation. Similarly, we
denote if, and 17,1 as the estimates in the training set using CNA pro—
files based on CBS (DNACopy) segmentation. We distinguish the
predicted tumour histology in the validation set using CNA profiles
based on the smooth and CBS segmentation as

y; 2 1(h-1{X.Bi + Zni}20-5) and (10>

$5 2 1(10‘1{Xvii:i +Z§9f}20.5), (11)

respectively.

Denoting yi=(yi1yiz  rim) and y. :(3’1/13’1/2  m),
we measure the agreement in prediction between the two segmenta—
tion methods as

A high value of 1c indicates that, given a classification model, the pre—
diction in the validation using CNA profiles based on smooth seg—
mentation is in agreement with those based on the CBS
segmentation.

2.7 Software

An R package called CNALR is available from the corresponding
author’s webpage (‘Availability’ in the abstract section), including
some tools to combine the results of normalization from CNAnorm
package (Gusnanto et al., 2012). The CNAnorm package normal—
izes each sequence individually, and the CNALR package will select
relevant quantities from the CNAnorm output. The CNALR pack—
age contains functions to handle the CNA profiles across patients
and fit a logistic regression.

3 Results

In this section, we mainly present the results for the lung cancer
dataset. For the oral cancer dataset, we present its results mainly in
the Supplementary Material.

3.1 CNA profiles

In this section, we briefly describe the summary of the profiles
within each histology. Figure 2 shows (point—wise) means of the
CNA profiles across the patients within each of the squamous and
ADC groups. One point in Figure 2 corresponds to a genomic win—
dow, and is the mean of CNA at the same genomic window (as illus—
trated in Fig. 1) across different patients in each histology group.
The figure indicates that the means of CNA profiles between the
two groups share many similarities, although some differences can
be observed. For example, we observe that the overall gains in 3g
and 2p regions are higher in the squamous group than those in the
ADC group.

Although the pattern in, e.g. 31] region indicates a separation be—
tween the squamous and ADC groups, this does not mean that a
modelling is not needed. Gains in 217 and 31] are not exclusive to the
squamous group, just more common. If we rely the classification of
tumour histology only on the pattern that we observe in the 31] re—
gion, then effectively we ignore the contribution of other genomic
regions in the genome, as well as risk mis—classifying any sample
which happens by chance to have a small number of CNAs in the
‘wrong’ places. Our results below suggest that the histology

profiles, the variable selection still gives the same low median of
classification error as that of logistic regression (Section 2.3).

For the oral cancer data, we have a more challenging situation
where it is sometimes more difficult to distinguish oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) from ()VC histologically. Figure 7 describes
the prediction error in the oral cancer data. The figure indicates that
the logistic regression and SLR have the lowest prediction error in
both smooth and CBS (DNAcopy) segmented CNA profiles.
Support vector machines with nu-classification has a low prediction
error comparable to the logistic regression, only when using the
smooth-segmented CNA profiles.

Still within the cross-validation, Figure 8 presents how the two
segmentation methods (smooth and CBS segmentation) agree in pre-
diction within the validation set. If the agreement is low, then the
choice of segmentation method does matter—in terms of

Fig. 6. Classification error from 100 cross-validations (38 observations in
each of the training set and validation set) using only the smooth- and CBS-
segmented CNA profiles in the lung cancer dataset across different classifi-
cation models: logistic regression (‘Log’), KNN with k : 1. 2 ('K1’-‘K2’), diag-
onal quadratic ('DA1’) and linear ('DA2’) discriminant analysis, ‘PLSs’, elastic
net ('Net’), lasso ('Las’), neural network ('NN’), support vector machines with
C-classification ('SV1’), nu classification ('SV2’), and bound-constraint classifi-
cation (‘SV3’) and 'SLR’. The horizontal dotted line is the median ofclassifica-
tion error 0fthe logistic regression. Figures with ‘K3’-‘K7’ are presented in the

classification error—when we use a particular classification method.
The contrary can be said if the agreement is high. Figure 8 indicates
that we have a high agreement when we use logistic regression and
support vector machines. PLS, elastic net and lasso models have
lower agreement in the lung cancer data compared with the logistic
regression, and this agreement increases in the oral cancer data to be
comparable to the logistic regression.

The overall results of our cross-validation suggest that the logis-
tic regression is able to achieve a low classification error while main-
taining high agreement in prediction between the smooth- and CBS-
segmented CNA profiles.

4 Discussion

In predicting tumour histology, the main challenge is to consider a
model with low classification error. Further than that, we are also
interested in the agreement between smooth- and CBS-segmented
CNA profiles in the prediction of new tumour sample. This is crit-
ical when we consider that the CNA profiles are derived from low-
coverage NGS data that have undergone several preparation steps.
This includes, but is not limited to, mapping to the reference gen-
ome, filtering, optimal window estimation, normalization (including
normalization due to contamination) and segmentation. To have a
classification method with a good prediction while having a min-
imum dependency on a previous pre-processing step is a great
advantage.

The logistic regression described in Section 2.3 (also known as
TIA/7071011 regularization) is well-known to tend to group variables
(genomic window) together (Zou and Hastie, 2005). This property of

Classiﬁcation methods

Fig. 7. Classification error from 100 cross-validations (52 and 50 observa-
tions in the training set and validation set, respectively) in the oral cancer
dataset using only the smooth- and CBS-segmented CNA profiles across dif-
ferent classification models: logistic regression (‘Log'), KNN with k 21,2
(‘K1'-‘K2'), diagonal quadratic (‘DA1') and linear (‘DA2') discriminant analysis,
‘PLSs', elastic net (‘Net'), lasso (‘Las'), neural network (‘NN'), support vector
machines with C-classification ('SV1'), nu classification ('SV2'), and bound-
constraint classification (‘SV3') and ‘SLR'. The horizontal dotted line is the
median of classification error of the logistic regression. Figures with ‘K3'-‘K7'
are presented in the Supplementary Material. The significance of the classifi-
cation error betvveen pair of methods are also presented in the
Supplementary Material

the logistic regression is likely to predominate in prediction, in terms
of classification error and agreement between the segmentation meth—
ods, because there are some dependencies of CNA between neigh—
bouring genomic windows. The lasso and elastic net models achieve
comparable classification error as the logistic regression only when
the CNA profiles are CBS—segmented. The CBS (DNACopy) segmen—
tation generally outputs long segments, and the variable selection ef—
fect that the two methods produce does not impair the prediction
because the genomic regions that survive the penalization are able to
represent the information of the whole segment.

We have demonstrated the ability of the proposed method to dis—
tinguish between two subtypes of lung cancer. We then validated
this method in a separate cohort of oral cancer patients, whose diag—
nosis is not always straightforward, but whose prognosis is very dif—
ferent. However, in theory, it could be used to distinguish between
any subtypes of tumour, or to make predictions about disease pro—
gression, drug resistance or outcome.

Currently, several molecular classifiers are used to distinguish
cancer subtypes, among them mRNA or protein expression. These
are both selective methods. The study of mRNA usually involved
the removal of non—coding RNA and micro RNA, the roles of which
are increasingly becoming apparent. The study of protein expression
usually involves only a few known proteins. Both of these methods
will also involve further depletion of valuable sample material.
Where there is no known mRNA or protein signature, our method
may prove useful in finding previously unsuspected differences in
the genomes of two sample groups. Low coverage sequencing is also
possible with extremely low quantities of badly degraded DNA

prediction from 100 cross-validations in the lung cancer dataset (top panel)
and oral cancer dataset (bottom panel) across different classification mod-
els: logistic regression (‘Log'), KNN with k : 1,2 (‘K1'-‘K2'), diagonal quad-
ratic (‘DA1') and linear (‘DA2') discriminant analysis, ‘PLSs', elastic net (‘Net'),
lasso (‘Las'), neural network (‘NN'), support vector machines with C-classifi-
cation (‘SV1'), nu classification ('SV2'), and bound-constraint classification
(‘SV3') and ‘SLR'. For the oral cancer dataset (bottom panel) the agreement
for DA1 and DA2 are below 0.6. The horizontal dotted line is the median of
agreement in the logistic regression. Figures with ‘K3'-‘K7' are presented in
the Supplementary Material

(Wood et al., 2010). If mRNA or protein tests are available, then
their results can be easily added to the logistic regression method as
additional predictors and will further improve performance.

5 Conclusion

We have investigated that the use of logistic regression to model
tumour histology and include the genome—wide CNA profiles as
predictors. The model enables us to include clinical characteristics
as fixed covariates and CNA profiles as random predictors in a
single modelling framework. The model exhibits a good fit and, in a
cross—validation, shows minimal classification error. The model also
demonstrates the best agreement in prediction between CNA pro—
files produced by two very different segmentation methods.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In addition to alternative splicing, alternative polyadenyla-
tion has also been identiﬁed as a critical and prevalent regulatory
mechanism in human gene expression. However, the mechanism of
alternative polyadenylation selection and the involved factors is still
largely unknown.

Results: We use the ENCODE data to scan DNA functional elements,
including chromatin accessibility and histone modification, around
transcript cleavage sites. Our results demonstrate that polyadenylation
sites tend to be less sensitive to DNase I. However, these polyadeny-
lation sites have preference in nucleosome-depleted regions, indicat-
ing the involvement of chromatin higher-order structure rather than
nucleosomes in the resultant lower chromatin accessibility. More inter-
estingly, for genes using two polyadenylation sites, the distal sites
show even lower chromatin accessibility compared with the proximal
sites or the unique sites of genes using only one polyadenylation site.
We also observe that the histone modification mark, histone H3 lysine
36 tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the
cleavage sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from
those of genes using a single polyadenylation site. Surprisingly, the
H3K36Me3 levels are comparable among the alternative polyadenyla-
tion sites themselves. In summary, polyadenylation and alternative
polyadenylation are closely related to functional elements on the
DNA level.

1 INTRODUCTION

Post-transcriptional RNA processing, including 5/ capping,
intron splicing, RNA editing and polyadenylation [poly (A)],
has been recognized as important regulation steps of gene ex-
pression. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread
mechanism in eukaryotic cells to control gene expression by pro-
ducing transcript isoforms with different poly (A) sites. It has
been reported that ~30% of human genes can select APA sites in
their 3/-untranslated regions (UTRs) (Lin et al., 2012). Even
though most of the genes with APA produce identical proteins,
APA can also alter gene expression by changing microRNA-
binding regions (Mayr and Bartel, 2009), transportation and
protein production rates (Lutz, 2008). Recent research provides
evidence that genes have preference for isoforms with shorter

3/-UTRs in embryonic or cancer cells because these isoforms
have higher translational efficiency than longer isoforms (Ji
et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2012; Shepard et al., 2011). The study
of polyadenylation in five mammals demonstrated that the usage
of poly (A) sites is more conserved in the same tissue across
different species than within a species (Derti et al., 2012). All
of these reﬂect the functional and evolutional importance of
APA regulation.

In general, poly (A) sites contain two core elements, the con-
served AAUAAA hexamer in the upstream and the GU—/U—rich
region in the downstream. The AAUAAA, referred as polyade-
nylation signal (PAS), is located ~1(%35 nucleotides upstream of
the cleavage site and acts as the binding motif for the cleavage
and polyadenylation speciﬁcity factor (CPSF). The GU— or
U-rich region, located 2040 nucleotides downstream of poly
(A) sites, is recognized by the cleavage stimulatory factor
(CstF). CstF is recruited by CPSF and assembled into a protein
complex to process polyadenylation (Edmonds, 2002). The high
evolutional conservation of these two motifs indicates their crit-
ical roles in polyadenylation.

To investigate other factors related to polyadenylation and the
alternative selection of poly (A) sites, we combined different
types of data from the ENCODE project (Dunham et al.,
2012), including RNA-PET data, DNase-seq data, MNase-seq
data and ChIP—seq data. We observed the low chromatin acces-
sibility around poly (A) sites, especially around the distal poly
(A) sites of genes using two cleavage sites. This low chromatin
accessibility is not because of the high density of nucleosomes.
Conversely, poly (A) sites prefer nucleosome-depleted regions. In
addition, the higher level of tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine
36 (H3K36me3) was observed around APA sites compared with
unique poly (A) sites, suggesting the role of histone modiﬁcation
in simultaneously deploying multiple poly (A) sites for a single
gene. However, no signiﬁcant difference was detected among the
multiple poly (A) sites themselves.

2 METHODS

The poly (A) sites were identiﬁed from the RNA-PET data in the nucleus
of cells from the ENCODE project (Djebali et al., 2012). Note that RNA-
PET has been used to map the 5’ cap and the 3’ poly (A) signatures of
individual transcripts (Fullwood et al., 2009). Here, we speciﬁcally tar-
geted on the nuclear compartment because the cleavage of transcripts
from DNA occurs in the nucleus. Ensembl gene annotations (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/) were applied to obtain the largest potential genomic
region of each gene. Poly (A) sites within 20 bp were considered as the

same one. To capture novel poly (A) locations beyond the known gene
regions, we extended each gene region to at most 3500 bp without over-
lapping other genes. After inferring the poly (A) sites from the RNA-PET
data, the genes were classiﬁed into several groups based on the number of
poly (A) sites they used for the considered cell line. In this article, we
mainly focused on the comparison between genes using a single poly (A)
site and genes using two poly (A) sites. HeLa-S3 cells, for example, had
1560 genes using two poly (A) sites and 3607 genes using only one poly
(A) site. According to our procedures, if a gene could choose an alterna-
tive poly (A) site in a different cell line but only exhibited a single poly (A)
site in the considered cell line, we counted it as a gene using only one poly
(A) site. Similarly, we required that both poly (A) sites were used in the
considered cell line to claim a gene using two poly (A) sites. Randomly
chosen positions from the ending sites of middle exons and body regions
of exons were treated as control groups. Additionally, we considered
random positions in intergenic regions or pseudogenes. We applied the
same examinations to six different human cell lines including HeLa-S3,
HepG2, HUVEC, GM12878, NHEK and K562.

The chromatin accessibility was estimated by the DNase I hypersensi-
tive experiments performed at Duke University in the ENCODE project.
Because of the low coverage of DNase-seq data, we constructed a window
of 80 bp and calculated the average DNase signal. We focused on the
160 bp regions consisting of two 80 bp windows for both the upstream
and the downstream of poly (A) sites. Because of the possible relationship
between nucleosome occupancy and chromatin accessibility, we investi-
gated the nucleosome positions around poly (A) sites with the MNase-seq
data that were only available in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines from
the ENCODE project.

The Chip-seq data of H3K36Me3 marks from University of
Washington in the ENCODE project were combined with the RNA-
PET data to investigate the histone modiﬁcation marks around poly
(A) sites with the 80 bp-window strategy aforementioned. Genes using
three APA sites were also examined to conﬁrm our conclusions.
Additionally, we examined other modiﬁcation data from the ENCODE
project such as H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks. However, no evidence
of possible association between these markers and APA sites was
observed. All the statistical tests were performed with the SAS
programming.

3 RESULTS

Based on the Ensembl gene annotations, there were 57 892 non-
overlapping genes. For each of the six considered human cell
lines, we inferred the used poly (A) sites of each gene using the
RNA-PET reads and classiﬁed the genes into different groups.
Then the DNase-seq data reflecting the chromatin accessibility
were considered on the poly (A) sites. Using the K562 cell line as
an example, the DNase signals demonstrated lower chromatin
accessibility around poly (A) sites than those around randomly
chosen ending positions of middle exons or those around
random positions inside an exon body (P<0.0001, Wilcoxon
tests; average DNase signals were 0.01(%0.015 versus 0.0177
0.023) (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly, the distal cleavage sites of genes
using two poly (A) sites displayed signiﬁcantly lower signals than
other poly (A) sites (P:0.00014).0078, Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests or Wilcoxon tests; average DNase signals were 0.01%
0.012 versus 001341015). However, the difference between the
proximal poly (A) sites and the unique poly (A) sites was insig-
niﬁcant (P: 0530.88, Wilcoxon tests), although the latter but
not the former was the final terminus of gene transcription. As
shown in Figure 1B, similar patterns were observed in other cell
lines. However, the signals in the HUVEC and the NHEK cell

lines were weaker, and this could be due to the different data
qualities.

Intergenic regions and pseudogenes are tightly associated with
lower levels of DNase hypersensitivity. The lower chromatin ac-
cessibility around the distal cleavage sites could be due to the
higher level of contamination with sites from intergenic regions
or pseudogenes. Our study of random positions from intergenic
regions and pseudogenes conﬁrms the lower hypersensitivity
in these regions than other groups (P<0.037, Wilcoxon tests;
Fig. 1A). We then investigated the original RNA-PET signals
for our poly (A) sites. If the distal cleavage sites include more
false sites from intergenic regions or pseudogenes, weaker RNA-
PET signals are expected for this group. However, we found no
significant signal strength difference between the distal and the
proximal poly (A) sites (P>0.246, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
for all six cell lines). Distal poly (A) sites had even higher RNA-
PET signals than unique poly (A) sites in three cell lines (HepG2,
GM12878 and NHEK; P< 0.012, Wilcoxon tests) and no signiﬁ-
cant difference was observed in the other three cell lines. All these
indicate that the quality of poly (A) site discovery is comparable
among different groups, and the lower levels of chromatin acces-
sibility around distal poly (A) sites are not because of the higher
contamination levels of false sites from intergenic regions or
pseudogenes. Additionally, the verification experiments of the
RNA-PET data in the ENCODE project showed that >99%
of the PETs represented full-length transcripts (Dunham et al.,
2012). This indicates the low false discovery rate in our identiﬁ-
cation of poly (A) sites.

To conﬁrm the association between the lower chromatin ac-
cessibility and the transcript cleavage, we designed another ana-
lysis. Genes with two potential poly (A) sites across all the cell
lines were selected. For each site, the DNase signals from the six
cell lines were divided into two groups according to whether the
cell line used the site for polyadenylation. The average signals
were calculated for each group of the site. Then the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was performed on the average signals of all the
proximal or the distal poly (A) sites, respectively. The signiﬁ-
cantly lower accessibility was observed for cell lines using the
sites for polyadenylation compared with cell lines without
using the sites for polyadenylation [P=2.96 x 10—7 or
2.66 x 10—6 for proximal or distal poly (A) sites].

Because nucleosome occupancy is closely related to chromatin
accessibility, we further investigated whether the lower chroma-
tin accessibility around poly (A) sites was due to the densely
occupied nucleosomes or because of other higher-order chroma-
tin structures. Some studies showed that in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, the high % AT content correlates with low nucleo-
some occupancy especially in homopolymeric runs of poly (A)
and poly (T) occurring in the 5/ or 3/ nucleosome-free region
(Jansen and Verstrepen, 2011). The nucleosomes depletion
around poly (A) sites in human T cells was also observed
(Spies et al., 2009). To check the nucleosome occupancy
around poly (A) sites in our considered cell lines, we obtained
the MNase-seq signals. Randomly chosen exonic or exon ending
sites were processed as control groups as mentioned previously.
Using the K562 cell line as an example, Figure 2 clearly shows
that poly (A) sites, no matter whether they are unique or APA
sites, have lower nucleosome occupancy than random exonic or
exon ending sites (P:0.00014).0055, Wilcoxon tests; average

the difference between the two groups. For the comparison between distal poly (A) sites and proximal poly (A) sites, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were

performed instead

Fig. 2. Nucleosome distribution around poly (A) sites in the K562 cell line.
Three lines represent the third quartile, the median and the ﬁrst quartile of
the MNase-seq values at each position. For all the three different poly (A)
groups, the cleavage sites display fewer nucleosomes than randomly
chosen exonic or exon ending positions

signals were 0.857105 versus 1.0}120). The MNase-seq data
were also available for the GM12878 cell line. Similar results
were observed (P<0.0001, Wilcoxon tests). The results indicate

that the lower chromatin accessibility around poly (A) sites is not
due to the high density of nucleosomes, and it could be due to
other higher-order chromatin structures. Additionally, nucleo-
somes were well positioned in exons compared with introns
(the ‘Exon ending’ panel in Fig. 2). Previous research has dis-
covered that nucleosomes are preferentially positioned in exons,
and the organization is evolutionary conserved (Schwartz et al.,
2009).

H3K36me3 has been reported as a determinant of pre-mRNA
alternative splicing (Soojin Kim, 2011). To further study the pos-
sible relationship between APA and H3K36me3 modiﬁcation,
the H3K36me3 signals around poly (A) sites were collected
from the ChIP-seq data of the ENCODE project, and the aver-
age read coverage within a 80 bp window was calculated.
Signiﬁcantly differences were observed in the H3K36me3 signals
between unique poly (A) sites and APA sites after applying
Wilcoxon rank tests (P< 0.0178 with the vast majority
<0.0001, Wilcoxon tests, all six cell lines). More speciﬁcally,
the poly (A) sites of genes using multiple cleavage sites in a cell
line demonstrated higher H3K36me3 levels. The average signals
are 3.5 for multi-poly (A) genes and 3.1 for unique poly (A)
genes. As H3K36me3 modiﬁcation may depend on nucleosomes,
we removed the regions with weak MNase-seq signals (i.e. the
average density signal equal to zero), the conclusion is the same
(P< 0.0018, Wilcoxon tests, the GM12878 and K562 cell lines).
Similar analysis was performed for gene using three APA sites to
conﬁrm our conclusion that the higher H3K36me3 level was
observed in APA sites. The proximal, middle and distal APA
sites all exhibited signiﬁcantly higher H3K36me3 signals than
unique poly (A) sites (P<0.0030 with the vast majority
<0.0001, Wilcoxon tests, all six cell lines). Interestingly, the mul-
tiple cleavage sites of the same gene demonstrated similar
H3K36me3 signals among themselves (P> 0.0523, Wilcoxon

Fig. 3. An example of H3K36me3 signals in the K562 cell line. The big arrows indicate the APA sites of DTNBPl and the uniquely deployed poly
(A) site of HCCS in the considered cell line. The APA sites tend to display higher H3K36me3 modiﬁcation than the unique poly (A) site

signed-rank tests, all six cell lines). An example of H3K36me3
around poly (A) sites is shown in Figure 3. Gene DTNBPl used
two poly (A) sites in the K562 cell line, but gene HCCS only used
one poly (A) site in this cell line. The ﬁgure clearly shows the
higher H3K36me3 levels of the APA sites than those of the
unique poly (A) site.

4 DISCUSSION

We discovered the low chromatin accessibility around poly (A)
sites across six human cell lines, especially for the distal poly (A)
sites of genes using multiple poly (A) sites.

The phenomenon of less number of nucleosomes located
around poly (A) sites is consistent with previous reports.
Speciﬁcally, regions around poly (A) sites contained higher AT
% than those random exonic or exon ending sites (e. g.
P< 2.2 x 10—16, Wilcoxon tests, NHEK cell line). Therefore,
we excluded the possibility that the lower chromatin accessibility
around poly (A) sites was resulted from higher nucleosome oc-
cupancy. Interestingly, the proximal instead of the distal poly (A)
sites exhibited similar chromatin accessibility with the unique
poly (A) sites, although both the distal and the unique poly
(A) sites were the final termini of gene transcription.

H3K36me3 modification was found to peak within actively
transcribed genes especially in exonic regions and, therefore,
has been considered as an indicator for transcriptional regions
of genes (Bannister, 2004). Accordingly, the unique poly (A) sites
of genes with only one cleavage site, as the transcription termini,
were expected to have lower H3K36me3 compared with the
proximal poly (A) sites of APA genes. Surprisingly, there was
no significant difference between the distal and the proximal poly
(A) sites of the same gene. These APA sites all tended to have
higher H3K36me3 than the unique poly (A) sites (Fig. 3), indi-
cating the distinct role of H3K36me3 in genes using APA.

Previous study reported that H3K36me3 was more enriched at
poly (A) sites of short isoforms than those of long isoforms (Lin
et al., 2012). This discrepancy may be due to the distinct criteria
for the selection of proximal and distal poly (A) sites. We
required the usage of both sites in the considered cell line. On
the contrary, they pooled the poly (A) sites from multiple breast
tissues to claim a short or long isoform and did not require the
usage of both poly (A) sites when they compared histone modi-
ﬁcation signals in a speciﬁc cell line. Thus, some of the poly (A)
sites of their short or long isoforms can be the unique sites ac-
cording to our definitions. Instead of using the windows, they
focused on the distributions of the distance between the poly (A)

site and the nearest H3K36me3 mark. When we applied the
KolmogoroviSmirnov test to our selected sites in our considered
cell lines, there was still no signiﬁcant difference for the distance
distributions among the APA sites of the same genes (P>0.84
for all the six cell lines).

For the H3k36me3 study, to confirm there were no additional
poly (A) sites in the downstream, we searched for the longest
genomic ranges of genes ab initio instead of relying on the known
gene annotation, as we showed in Section 3. Thus, after identify-
ing the initial and terminal sites of transcripts from the RNA-
PET reads, overlapped transcripts were clustered and considered
as the same genes. Similar results were observed.

We also examined the possible associations between poly (A)
site signals and DNase hypersensitivity, nucleosome occupancy
or H3K36me3 marks. The range of signiﬁcant Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficients was —0.019 to 0.142 for DNase hyper-
sensitivity, —0.063 to 0.065 for nucleosome occupancy and
—0.078 to 0.166 for H3K36me3. Thus, the association patterns
were inconsistent among different cell lines, and the correlation
magnitude was small. As we mentioned before, the RNA-PET
data in the ENCODE project are of high quality, indicating the
low false discovery rate even for poly (A) sites with low RNA-
PET signals. Furthermore, the level of RNA-PET signals is con-
founded by gene expression, and gene expression is also tightly
associated with DNase hypersensitivity, nucleosome occupancy
0r H3K36me3 marks.

The human poly (A) sites identiﬁcation had been implemented
by machine-leaming methods using sequence and structural
patterns around poly (A) sites (Chang et al., 2011). The accuracy
rate for their model or polya_svm (Cheng et al., 2006) was
~6(%70% when applying coding sequences as the negative set.
Here, we applied the Support Vector Machine method libsvm
(Chang and Lin, 2011) and input DNase sensitivity, nucleosome
occupancy signals and histone marks as features. The accuracy
was 6&68% for poly (A) sites prediction, 5&57% for APA
prediction and 5¢S6% for proximal or distal poly (A) sites pre-
diction. The results suggest that our discovered DNA functional
elements provide comparable information with the sequence and
structural patterns when predicting poly (A) sites. In the future,
we can develop a complicate model to use all these features to
further improve the prediction of poly (A) sites.

In conclusion, we observed distinct patterns of DNase I
sensitivity and H3K36me3 around the multiple cleavage sites
simultaneously used by a gene. The detailed mechanism needs
more speciﬁc biological examinations.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Gene duplication and loss are important processes in the
evolution of gene families. Moreover, growth of families by duplication
and retention is an important mechanism by which organisms gain
new functions. Therefore the ability to infer the evolutionary histories
of families is an important step in understanding the evolution of
function. We have recently developed DupliPHY, a software tool to
infer gene family histories using parsimony and maximum likelihood.
Here, we present DupliPHY-Web a web server for DupliPHY that im-
plements additional maximum likelihood functionality and provides
users an intuitive interface to run DupliPHY.

Availability and implementation: DupliPHY-Web is available at www.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ohno (1970) ﬁrst proposed that gene or genome duplication is a
major mechanism for generating functional innovation and
genome evolution. For eukaryotes it has been estimated that
50% of genes are expected to duplicate at least once in time
scales of the order of 357350 million years (Lynch and Conery,
2000). Indeed, up to 30% of the yeast genome may have arisen by
duplication events (Rubin et al., 2000). There is also evidence for
whole genome duplication (WGD) in yeast (Wolfe and Shields,
1997), which was followed by rapid and extensive gene loss (Kellis
et al., 2004). Gene duplication also seems to have been important
in the evolution of humans (McLysaght et al., 2002).

Determining the evolution of gene families and identifying the
gain and loss events is, therefore, necessary to understanding the
processes of gene family evolution. Previously, we have released
the software DupliPHY (Ames et al., 2012) that provides
weighted parsimony and maximum likelihood methods to
accurately infer the evolutionary histories of gene families. The
software has been used to identify lineage-speciﬁc expansions of
gene families in yeast (Ames et al., 2014). DupliPHY works on
gene copy number counts to infer gene family evolution and is
different from tree reconciliation methods that infer duplication
and loss events based on gene and species trees (Larget et al.,
2010). The tool requires a file describing the membership of gene
families for a range of species and a phylogenetic tree describing
the evolutionary relationship between these species.

The DupliPHY programs are written in Java V1.7 and are run
from the command line. Here, we introduce DupliPHY-Web, a
web interface for the DupliPHY programs that provides users
with a Visual method of running the programs without any local
installation. There is substantial help documentation and a walk-
through for novice users, including advice on the interpretation
of the results. Additionally, DupliPHY-ML has been updated
with a new model of gene family evolution and to make the
program more conﬁgurable. Ultimately, DupliPHY-Web will
provide a useful tool for analysing gene family evolution.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 The web server

DupliPHY-Web is a web interface which can be used to run the
DupliPHY programs (Fig. l). The run options for both pro-
grams are divided into mandatory and optional parameters.
The web interface ensures that all necessary parameters have
been selected before the data are submitted to the server. To
run either DupliPHY program the user will need a family file
and a phylogenetic tree. Descriptions of the file formats as well as
instructions of how to generate the underlying data for these ﬁles
can be found in the help documentation.

Once the user has submitted his/her data, DupliPHY-Web
validates the input ﬁles to check for errors. The validation
checks the format and consistency of all options and ﬁles up-
loaded. If any errors are encountered the user is immediately
notiﬁed and can then upload the corrected files. As
DupliPHY-ML may be slow on large datasets, the DupliPHY-
ML analysis on the server has been limited to <10 000 families,
no families with >75 members and the analysis must contain
<100 species. Once the input ﬁles have passed the validation
stage, the tool starts the analysis.

The results of the analysis are emailed to the user. After
running DupliPHY the user will receive a ﬁle containing the
ancestral reconstruction for each family, which shows the size
of each family at each node of the tree. DupliPHY also returns
a tree ﬁle with one tree per family. Here, the internal nodes are
labelled with the ancestral family sizes and can be Viewed using a
phylogenetic tree Viewer. DupliPHY-ML also returns a file re-
porting the ancestral sizes for each family. In addition,
DupliPHY-ML returns a tree ﬁle containing the input phylogen-
etic tree where the branch lengths represent the average number
of inferred events on that branch. The results also include ﬁles
containing the estimated parameters for the model used, the
mean posterior rates for each family and the probabilities for
each of the inferred ancestral family sizes. For both programs

and start the analysis. The results of the analysis are then emailed to the supplied email address

produced.

2.2 Updates to DupliPHY-ML

DupliPHY-ML has been updated to be more configurable,
allowing the user to choose a speciﬁc optimizer, whether to ﬁx
or infer branch lengths, and to choose the method of ancestral
reconstruction. Perhaps most notably, DupliPHY-ML now con-
tains a new model of gene family evolution that contains a par-
ameter for the extinction of a family. Here, extinction refers to an
event where a family is completely lost from the genome. This
family can subsequently only be regained by an innovation event.
It is important to consider the extinction of gene families as these
events are common, there have been an estimated 12 extinctions
per million years in Drosophila (Hahn et al., 2007). The new
model is the Birth-Death-Innovation-Extinction (BDIE) model,
and is deﬁned by the instantaneous rate matrix Q:

bifj— i=1andi7é 0(birth)
difi —j= l andj>0(death)

QU = hifi=0 andj= 1 (innovation) (1)
kif j = 0 and i = l (extinction)

0if |i — j| > 1 (maximum one event)

The BDIE model is more biologically relevant than our pre-
vious models (Ames et al., 2012) and aims to describe more
processes in the evolution of gene families (Ames et al., 2014).
We benchmarked both the EDI and BDIE models on simulated
data and found both models can accurately infer ancestral gene
family sizes (Supplementary File 1). As the run time of these
models varies the BDI model is recommended for large datasets
that may result in long run times, whereas the BDIE model
should be used in cases where extinction maybe common.
Models that encompass even more biological realism, such as
segmental or WGD events, will be important for future research.

3 CONCLUSIONS

Inferring the evolutionary histories of families is an important
step in understanding the evolution of function. DupliPHY-Web
provides an intuitive web interface for the DupliPHY programs,
enabling users to conveniently run gene family evolution ana-
lyses. Users have access to extensive help documentation, and
future versions of DupliPHY, including the addition of new
models, can be deployed directly to the server.

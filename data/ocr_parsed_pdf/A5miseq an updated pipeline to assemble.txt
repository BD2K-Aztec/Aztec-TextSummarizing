Assembly accuracy for the A5—miseq and A5 pipelines measured on raw 100>< coverage MiSeq PE250 GAGE—B data. Accuracy was measured by QUAST. Frac is the fraction
of the reference genome represented in assembly scaffolds. NGA50: the N50 after breaking contigs at misassemblies. MA: number of misassemblies, MM: number of
nucleotide mismatches per 100 kbp, Genes: number of intact full—length genes recovered. For GAGE—B results, the single best assembly result for each metric and genome
reported in Magoc et a]. (2013) is shown, with the assembler producing the best result indicated as follows: S : SPAdes 2.3, sdn : SOAPdenovo, M : MaSuRCA,

A : ABySS, sga : SGA.

from NCBI, ref . gf f is the reference’s annotated genes from NCBI and
ass . fa is the assembly. The —u option causes the genome fraction to be
calculated in the manner used by QUAST v1.3. This yields results that are
comparable with those in the GAGE-B paper.

In a separate experiment, we evaluated how the completeness of assem-
blies produced by A5 and A5-miseq changes in response to decreasing
amounts of sequence data. To do so, we took the 100>< coverage GAGE-
B datasets and randomly downsampled them to 50><, 40><, 30><, 20><,
10>< and 5>< coverage, assembled them and measured assembly accuracy
with QUAST.

3 DISCUSSION

The benchmarking results for A5—miseq on the GAGE—B data
(shown in Table 1) indicate that it offers substantial improve—
ments over the original A5 pipeline. A5—miseq assemblies contain
more full—length reference genes than A5 or any of the GAGE—B
assemblers. Relative to the original AS, the number of genes
missing from A5—miseq assemblies is reduced by 1.&3.8—fold
on the GAGE—B datasets. In most cases, A5—miseq assemblies
have higher NGASO values, fewer misassemblies and fewer base—
calling errors than the original A5 pipeline. A5—miseq produces
results that are competitive with the best achieved by other
assemblers on the GAGE—B data, but requires only minimal
user—effort.

A5—miseq can recover nearly complete genome assemblies with
much less sequence data than its predecessor. Figure 1 shows
that to recover a ﬁxed fraction of the genome, e.g. 95%,
A5—miseq requires about half as much sequence data. Relative
to A5, A5—miseq achieves higher degrees of contiguity with less
data. This permits deeper multiplexing of sequencing
experiments.

A5—miseq is computationally efficient. Assembly of the
B.cereus GAGE—B data completed in 2.2h with a peak
memory usage of 4GB and 5.7 GB disk usage on a laptop.
Computational requirements for other bacterial genomes are
similar.

One limitation of the GAGE—B data is that following its pub—
lication, assembly pipelines might be inadvertently tuned to pro—
duce high scores speciﬁcally on that dataset. This could result in
artiﬁcially high scores that do not accurately reﬂect the expected

 

Fig. 1. Contiguity of assemblies of the B.cereus data from GAGE-B with
increasing depths of coverage. A5 was run on reads cut down from 250nt
to 150nt. A5-miseq was run on both the cut down reads (red) and the full-
length 250nt reads (black). A5-miseq assemblies become highly contigu-
ous with 20>< coverage, whereas A5 (blue) requires 50>< coverage to
achieve comparable contiguity

performance on other datasets. We assert that we have not tuned
A5—miseq in any way to improve scores on the GAGE—B dataset,
and to our knowledge, none of the component programs used by
A5—miseq has been optimized for GAGE—B.

4 CONCLUSION

Genome assembly is a fast evolving ﬁeld, and software has been
advancing rapidly. Although A5—miseq produces assemblies that
are competitive with results in a recently published assembler
evaluation (Magoc et al., 2013), it is likely that versions of
other software that are currently under peer review (e.g.
SPAdes 3.0) might produce even better results. SPAdes 2.3 auto—
mates many of the same steps that A5—miseq automates
(Bankevich et al., 2012), and in general, produces excellent

assemblies (Table l), with A5—miseq’s main advantages being
automated adapter trimming, more full—length genes assembled,
NCBI—ready outputs and production of base—call quality scores.
If possible, researchers interested in genome assembly should
become acquainted with the various algorithms available
before selecting a particular approach. A5—miseq should be par—
ticurlarly useful for researchers with limited bioinformatics ex—
perience or computing resources.

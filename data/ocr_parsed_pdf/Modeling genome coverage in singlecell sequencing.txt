The highly non-uniform molecular abundances and unknown
dropout in the sequencing library are not the only problems in
specifying a model for the genome coverage in single-cell sequen-
cing experiments. The coverage of local bases will be highly cor-
related. There is the natural correlation caused by nearby bases
being covered by the same read. Additionally we expect broad
correlations due correlated molecular abundances of nearby re-
gions. One example is local correlations related to nucleotide con-
tent due to the uneven ampliﬁcation of MDA. These all create
problems in mathematically modeling the sequencing process, as
misspecification can create signiﬁcantly biased estimates.

Our aim in this paper is to present a method for estimating the
genome coverage of a reference genome in a deep sequencing
experiment, based only on information from a shallow initial
sequencing run. One key to our method is treating sequenced
nucleotides as independent observations despite the fact that
the true unit of sampling is the sequenced read. We show that
the loss of information caused by this assumption is acceptable.
We adapt the non-parametric empirical Bayes approach we de-
veloped previously for estimating library complexity (Daley and
Smith, 2013), which abstracts the sequencing process as a cap-
tureirecapture experiment. By applying our method to publicly
available human single-cell sequencing data from a variety of
sources and technologies, we demonstrate the method to be ac-
curate and widely applicable. We then investigate practical con-
siderations in applying the method, including methods to reduce
the running time and ways to reduce the cost of initial experi-
ments. Finally we apply our method to a broad swath of recent
shallow single-cell sequencing experiments to show the variability
of genome coverage for differing protocols.

2 THEORY

We assume a sequencing experiment samples molecules from a
large pool of DNA fragments in the library. Further, we assume
that the number of amplified copies of each DNA fragment is
sufficiently large that sampling behaves as with replacement.
Each molecule sampled during sequencing corresponds to a
sequenced read. Each sequenced read will cover multiple bases
in the genome: every sequenced nucleotide covers exactly one
base. Our goal is to use information from a shallow sequencing
run to predict the number of bases that would be covered after
deep sequencing. We call the shallow sequencing run the initial
experiment, and we make the essential assumption that the prop-
erties of the library do not change between the initial experiment
and deeper sequencing.
We define the following symbols:

G : haploid genome length in bp;

L : read length in bp;

N : number of reads sequenced in the initial experiment;
IN : number of reads sequenced in the full experiment;

I : fold extrapolation;

71,- : probability a randomly sequence read covers base 1';
LT : (ﬁla---57TG);

X: Nit, the expected number of reads covering each
position.

Consider the random trial of sequencing an individual read.
This can also be considered as L trials, one per nucleotide in the
read. The outcomes of these L trials correspond to covering L
consecutive bases in the genome. A second read whose origin
partially overlaps the first will provide an additional L trials,
some of which will cover new bases (Fig. 1). The part of the
genome where the two reads overlap, however, will correspond
to outcomes observed twice. Although the outcome of each of
these LN trials is dependent on L 7 1 others, this dependence is
highly localized. Similarly, for a given base in the genome, the
number of trials (sequenced nucleotides) whose outcome corres-
ponds to that base also has a strong local dependence: the
number of reads covering any given base is dependent on the
number covering 2L 7 2 others.

In adapting the non-parametric empirical Bayes approach of
Good and Toulmin (1956) to predict genome coverage, we will
follow the compound Poisson formulation elaborated by Efron
and Thisted (1976), who applied it to estimating Shakespeare’s
vocabulary based on his printed works. The way words may be
combined in English text follows both grammatical and stylistic
constraints. For example, in Julius Ceasar, the word ‘l/mu’ pre-
cedes ‘arl’ more than twice as often as it precedes ‘lhe’, despite
the word ‘lhe’ appearing 50 times more often than ‘arl’ in the
entire play. Efron and Thisted (1976) argued that this amount of
dependence can be ignored in a large enough body of work.
Unfortunately, the dependence introduced by sampling nucleo-
tides as contiguous reads is much stronger: by covering the ith
base in the genome, one greatly increases the probability that
base i + 1 will be covered.

For our application, however, the relations N >> L and G >> L
both hold in practice, meaning that dependence between events
(nucleotides in reads) and outcomes (covered bases in the refer-
ence genome) are both of extremely limited reach. When con-
sidering the outcomes, since we assume that reads are
multinomially sampled, as we previously considered (Daley
and Smith, 2013), the number of reads covering a position
depend only on the Lil positions downstream and Lil

positions upstream. Therefore, the set of dependence is 2L — 1
bases. We can apply a CheniStein argument to infer that the
limited dependence can be well approximated by assuming inde—
pendence (Barbour et al., 1992).

Deﬁne nj(t) as the number of bases covered by exactly j reads
after sequencing tN reads and let n,- denote the number of bases
covered by j reads in the initial experiment (i.e. n, = n/(1)). We call
the full vector n1, n2, . . . the coverage counts histogram. We
assume that the number of reads that cover each position follows
a Poisson process with rates independently and identically distrib—
uted according to [1, an arbitrary distribution with mean NL/ G.
This is known as the non—parametric compound Poisson model
(Wang and Lindsay, 2005) and under this model the expected
value of n/(t) is equal to

E0110»=Gﬂm(e’“(kt)’/ﬂ)d/L(k)- (1)

Although we know the number of positions in the genome that
are not covered by reads, the value no is not known because it
refers only to those positions not covered by the current sequen—
cing but might be covered if the same library were sequenced more
deeply. This implies that no is non—identiﬁable in the non—paramet—
ric model Link (2003), so analysis must be done with the identiﬁ—
able portions of the model, the counts n1, n2, . . .. Good and
Toulmin (1956) introduced an empirical Bayes approach that, in
our context, provides an estimator for the gain in genome cover—
age from sequencing an additional (t — 1)N reads. We refer to the
following as the GoodiToulmin estimator:

AC(1)=i(—1)j+l(t — 1M. (2)
./=1

The way these observed counts are obtained is illustrated sche—
matically in Figure 1.

As we previously discussed (Daley and Smith, 2013), the
GoodiToulmin estimator is highly accurate when predicting
the gain in coverage for small increases in the experiment.
Using the GoodiToulmin estimator to predict beyond I = 2 is
problematic and suffers from extreme instability. In particular,
the estimator will diverge to positive or negative inﬁnity depend—
ing on whether the largest observed coverage count is odd or
even. We introduced rational function approximations to
obtain globally stable estimates that still satisfy the nice local
properties of the GoodiToulmin estimator (Daley and Smith,
2013). A rational function approximation to a power series is a
ratio of polynomials that asymptotically approximates the power
series up to a given degree,

0—1)

To guide the selection of P and Q, we note that the coverage
will asymptote as the number of bases sequenced and the

sequencing depth goes to inﬁnity. This indicates that we should
choose P = Q — 1 so that the rational function behaves the same
in the limit as the coverage curve which we approximating. Our
observation is that this choice gives superior performance to
other rational function approximations (Supplementary Fig.
Sl), allowing for accurate and stable long—range predictions of
the genome coverage.

3 ACCURACY OF PREDICTIONS

We evaluated our method on 19 single—end 100 or 101 nucleotide
(nt) single—cell sequencing experiments (Lu et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2012; Zong et al., 2012) that were ‘deeply—sequenced’,
which we deﬁned as at least 100M reads. We downsampled
each library to 5 million (M) reads to simulate the initial sequen—
cing experiment and compared the estimated genome coverage
curve to the observed genome coverage curve, calculated by
downsampling the library and using BEDTools (Quinlan and
Hall, 2010). We measure the accuracy of our estimates by the
relative error, which we deﬁne as the observed genome coverage
minus the estimated divided by the observed.

Even for long—range extrapolations, the estimates remain
stable and accurate (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). When we
use 5 M sequenced reads (0.17 x coverage) to predict the genome
coverage for 100 M sequenced reads (3.33 x coverage), a 20—fold
extrapolation, we observed a mean absolute relative error of
<3% (Table Sl, Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).

We notice that our choice of order of the rational function
approximation tends to give conservative estimates of the
genome coverage (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).
Theoretically, the distribution of the curves should be symmetric
about the mean, but we observe a downward skew to curves
(D’Agostino skewness test (D’Agostino, 1970) on the relative
error for the 20—fold extrapolations P< 3 E — 16). We investigated
bootstrapping to reduce the skew and lower the variance of our
estimates (Breiman, 1996). The bootstrapped median shows sig—
niﬁcant improvement over the simple extrapolations and even
the bootstrapped mean (Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating
that the use of bootstrapping and aggregating the median
curve leads to more accurate estimates.

4 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

4.1 Binning to approximate coverage

The major computational demands in the extrapolation algo—
rithm come from bootstrapping the coverage counts histogram
to reduce variance of the estimator (see Supplementary
Information). The time required for resampling is a function of
the number of possible outcomes for each event, in this case
individual genome positions. An approach to reduce the running
time is therefore to partition the genome into non—overlapping
bins and use the bins as the outcomes of each random trial. If we
had an estimate for the number of bins that would be covered
after deep sequencing from the library, the genome coverage
could be estimated by multiplying that number of bins by their
size (or their average size, if the bins had varying sizes). We refer
to this approach as a binning based estimator. It is not difﬁcult
to see that counts for bins can be supplied to the GoodiToulmin

estimator in the same way as counts for individual nucleotides as
illustrated in Figure 1.

We assume the genome has been partitioned into equal sized
bins. There are several possible schemes one may follow to con—
struct a binning based estimator. If we say that a read covers a
bin only if it completely covers the bin then we will consistently
underestimate the coverage, and this excludes use of bins larger
than the read length. Conversely, if we say a read covers a bin if
there is any overlap then we will consistently overestimate
genome coverage. A reasonable approach is to say a read
covers a bin with probability proportional to the number of nu—
cleotides in the read that cover the bin (Supplementary Fig. SS).
This ensures that, for a single read, the probability any position
is covered by that read is unbiased. Unfortunately one can dem—
onstrate that even for binning based estimators that are unbiased
for a single read, they will be biased for multiple reads
(Supplementary Information). This also works in the other dir—
ection, if a strategy is biased for a ﬁxed number of multiple reads
then it will be biased for any other number of reads.

The binning—based estimator does indeed slightly underestimate
coverage (Supplementary Information, Supplementary Fig. S6).
Despite this, we observe that the binned coverage counts histo—
gram is approximately proportional to single base resolution
coverage counts histogram (Supplementary Fig. S7). This holds
even when the bin size is larger than the read length, so that reads
are randomly thrown out or extended to cover whole bin while on
average covering the same number of bases (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Fig. S7). The gain from binning is a reduction in
running time proportional to the bin size (Fig. 2b, Supplementary
Information). As can be seen from Supplementary Figure S6, this
comes at an acceptable cost in accuracy.

The binning procedure naturally introduces variance in the
estimated coverage count histogram and therefore also the bin
size due to the random nature of the binning. This variance in—
creases with the bin size, as portions of reads are more likely to
be thrown out or to be extended with increasing bin size. On the
other hand, the binning will group close neighboring bases to—
gether and reduce the variance introduced when treating close
bases as independent. Accordingly the variance of the estimated
coverage should achieve a minimum lying somewhere between
single base pair and the read length (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig.
S6 and S9).

4.2 Effects of read length on coverage estimates

At present the vast majority of whole—genome sequencing experi—
ments, including single—cell experiments, use Illumina sequencing
technology. Reads from this technology correspond to the ends
of DNA fragments. Suppose one sequences L nucleotide reads
that map unambiguously back to the reference genome, and that
the DNA fragments in the library all have length greater than L.
Using information about the genome coverage from that experi—
ment, one could compute what the genome coverage would have
been had the reads been of length L -l- 1. This can be done by
‘extending’ the reads in silico, which amounts to pretending the
reads were longer.

The cost of a sequencing experiment is approximately a linear
function of (i) the number of reads sequenced, and (ii) the length
of reads. For a variety of reasons, including optmization of total

throughput at sequencing centers, investigators are often pre—
sented with a relatively limited set of options. Often there are
options for a few standard read lengths that include both ‘short’
and ‘long’ options (at present, e.g. 36 and 100 nt). We asked
whether an approach of extending reads in silico could help min—
imize the cost of the initial experiment while still accurately pre—
dicting genome coverage in deeper sequencing with true longer
reads.

In line with the assumption above, we expect that in silico read
extension will work as long as the mapped reads ﬁnd their cor—
rect mapping positions at shorter read lengths. While this places
a lower bound on the lengths of reads that can be used, there are
only small differences in mappability for reads >36 nt (Derrien
et al., 2012).

To evaluate this approach, we examined four libraries given by
Sequencing Read Archive accession numbers SRX151616,
SRX202787, SRX204160 and SRX205367, which correspond re—
spectively to an MDA haploid, MALBAC diploid, MDA diploid
and MALBAC haploid libraries. We downsampled 5M reads
originally of length 100 bp, and then truncated the original
reads at 50 nt prior to mapping. We tested the results for extend—
ing the reads by 50 bp in silico versus extending the fold—extrapo—
lation (Supplementary Fig. 810). We see that the artiﬁcially
extended reads consistently overestimate the genome coverage
(mean relative error across all libraries = 0.018). On the other
hands, extending the fold—extrapolation on the mapped truncated
reads shows an increase in relative error compared to the full
length reads (mean relative error of 41028 across all libraries),
not unexpected, as we are estimating further away from the ini—
tial experiment. This indicates that artiﬁcially extending the reads
in silica is the incorrect strategy and we should simply extend the
fold extrapolation.

We next examined the effect of read length on the estimates
while holding constant the total number of nucleotides
sequenced. For each of the four libraries, we downsampled
5M reads at 100 nt, and 10M reads at 50 nt. The 50 nt read
samples consistently yield more accurate predictions of genome

S11). This result suggests that any bias associated with mapp-
ability and fragment length variance, at least for 50 nt reads and
the human reference genome, may be acceptable to reduce costs
for library test runs.

4.3 Does including duplicate reads impact predictions?

It is standard in many sequencing applications to remove all but
one read among a set believed to be amplified copies of the same
original DNA fragment (Sims 6! al., 2014). Multiple options are
available for identifying when reads are duplicates (Kivioja el al.,
2012). In the context of single-cell genotyping, one often seeks to
use duplicates to correct sequencing errors, a concept that has
been called “single-molecule consensus’ reads (Hiatt el al., 2013).

For most current methods of identifying ampliﬁcation dupli-
cates, all duplicate reads for a given molecule will map to the
same position in the genome. As a consequence, the genome
coverage for a given sequencing experiment will be identical
whether or not duplicates are removed. Moreover, in theory
the number of distinct reads that cover a particular position
should also approximately follow a Poisson process. This obser-
vation suggests two possible avenues for using the Goods
Toulmin genome coverage estimator to predict coverage from
deeper sequencing. The direct approach is to ignore duplicate
reads when making predictions based on the test run. A different
approach would be to make estimates using only unique reads,
and then to make predictions based on (i) the number of unique
reads in a deeper experiment, using the method of Daley and
Smith (2013), and (ii) to then predict genome coverage condi-
tional on the number of unique reads sequenced in the full ex-
periment (Supplementary Fig. S12). This second approach
includes two predictive steps, but neither of these steps would
be extrapolating as far as the direct approach. And we know that
the non-parametric empirical Bayes framework is more accurate
when extrapolations are less extreme.

Although genome coverage estimates with duplicates and
without duplicates should be equal, the variances may differ.
Therefore we compare the results from the same library under
both cases extrapolated to the same genome coverage achieved
at 100 M reads with duplicates included, so that the

fold-extrapolation is less for duplicates removed
(Supplementary Fig. S13). For some cases (MALBAC libraries),
the performance with duplicates removed comparable to includ-
ing duplicates. But for the MDA haploid libraries, the perform-
ance is worse (paired l-test, P<3E - 16). We therefore suggest
that the genome coverage is predicted with duplicated included,
but note that it can also be done with duplicates removed.

5 COMPARING LIBRARY PREP PROTOCOLS
There is little available data on the performance of specific
single-cell library preparation protocols based on deeply sequen-
cing the libraries. Existing information exists only for a few
protocols (Geigl el al., 2009; Zong el al., 2012) or for bacterial
genomes (Pinard el al., 2006; Zhang 6! al, 2006). The reason is
likely the cost associated with deeply sequencing libraries purely
to determine the degree to which they differ. This has almost
certainly also been a barrier to advances in single-cell library
protocols: evaluating each protocol variation is a major cost.

Because of its accuracy, our estimator completely eliminates
the cost barrier to developing and refining single cell library
protocols. Libraries can be constructed and their deep properties
inferred with high accuracy without actually deeply sequencing.
To illustrate this concept, we examined a multitude oflow-cover-
age single-cell sequencing experiments from a variety of recent
human studies (Evrony el al., 2012; Gole el al., 2013; Hou el al.,
2013; Kirkness el al., 2013; McConnell el al., 2013; Navin el al.,
2011; Ni 61 al., 2013). We limited our analysis to 209 libraries
with at least 500M total nucleotides mapped to autosomes
(equal to 0.17 x coverage). Because our error in estimating
genome coverage increases with fold-extrapolation, we down-
sampled all libraries to exactly 500M nucleotides mapped to
the autosomes, avoiding any effects of variable initial sample
size. We estimated genome coverage using a bin size of 5. We
then compare the estimates at 10 gigabases (2 3.5x coverage)
and 30 gigabases (2 10.4>< coverage) mapped to the autosomes.
A summary of all libraries can be found in Table S2.

Karyotype and ploidy can have a major impact on the appar-
ent genome coverage in a single-cell experiment. Conceptually,
higher copy-number for chromosomes, or large parts thereof,
means greater opportunity to observe reads mapping back to
the corresponding part of a reference genome. It can be difﬁcult
to resolve such issues for an individual cell without prior know-
ledge of genotype. In terms of our evaluations, these difference
mean that cells of differing karyotype or ploidy may not be
directly comparable. For example Gole el al. (2013) had to re-
strict their comparison to the MALBAC method in diploid data
to only a few chromosomes of the original data (Zong el al.,
2012) and to pooled haploid libraries (Lu 6! al, 2012) due to
unusual karyotype of the cell line used to benchmark the
method. To test the effect of ploidy we take matching first and
second polar bodies from Hou el al. (2013), resulting in 42 paired
samples. Every pair was excised, prepared, and sequenced at the
same time, which we hope will result in minimal batch effects.
We ﬁnd that the diploid libraries have signiﬁcantly higher cover-
age than the haploid libraries for all levels ofcoverage considered
(Supplementary Fig. S14), confirming that ploidy has a signifi-
cant effect on dropout.

single-cell libraries at sequencing depth of (c) 3.5x and (d) 10.4><

We next examine the differences in library preparation proto—
cols, keeping libraries from haploid and diploid cells separate.
For the haploid case, two studies have produced data from
human sperm cells ampliﬁed using MDA (Kirkness et al.,
2013) and second polar bodies and female pronuclei ampliﬁed
with MALBAC (Hou et al., 2013). We observed a signiﬁcant
difference in estimated coverage for both 3.5>< extrapolation
and 10.4>< extrapolation (Fig. 4a and b, two—sided t—test P<5E
a 11 for both the 3.5>< and 10.4>< coverage). With only one study
for each group we can not identify if the difference is due to the
differing protocols (MDA or MALBAC) or other factors.

For the diploid case data from four protocols is available: (i)
ﬁrst polar bodies (Hou et al., 2013) and circulating tumor cells
(Ni et al., 2013) ampliﬁed with MALBAC; (ii) neurons (Evrony
et al., 2012; Gole et al., 2013) and a single lymphocyte (Gole
et al., 2013) ampliﬁed with MDA; (iii) neurons (Gole et al., 2013)
ampliﬁed with MIDAS; and (iv) breast tumor cells (Navin et al.,
2011) and neurons (McConnell et al., 2013) ampliﬁed by Sigma—
Aldritch GenomePlex universal oligonucleotide primers (GP).

MALBAC and MDA libraries exhibit signiﬁcantly higher ex—
pected genome coverage than those based on MIDAS or GP, at
both depths considered (Fig 4c and d). MALBAC and MDA
also exhibit substantial variability in expected genome coverage;
these are the only protocols for which data was used from mul—
tiple studies. For MALBAC, the three libraries showing lowest
expected genome coverage are from circulating tumor cells (the
three lowest MALBAC points in Fig. 4c and (1). These have the
possibility of being polyploid or aneuploid, so by the logic above
we would expect these libraries to have predicted genome cover—
age at least that of the diploid first polar bodies. This indicates
that cell type and lab (which would account for slight differences
in library preparation protocol) may account for a large portion
of the variability and there are opportunities for optimization of
protocols to improve whole genome ampliﬁcation.

6 DISCUSSION

We described a method for predicting the genome coverage
gained from deeper sequencing of a single—cell genome sequen—
cing library based on a compound Poisson model of sequencing.
By ignoring local dependence, we can approximate the number
of bases covered by additional sequencing with a non—parametric
empirical Bayes estimator. This estimator is extremely accurate
for predicting additional coverage from relatively small amounts
of additional sequencing but suffers from large instabilities for
large amounts of additional sequencing. Applying rational func—
tion approximations removes the instability and allows us to
make accurate long—range predictions.

The running time of the algorithm may be unreasonably long
for single base resolution estimates. To facilitate researchers in
obtaining quick and accurate estimates, we introduced a strategy
to reduce the running time of the algorithm signiﬁcantly, with a
small cost in accuracy, by randomly binning reads. By choosing
the bin size, the researcher has the option to control how quickly
estimates can be obtained, keeping in mind the trade—off of ac—
curacy and variance.

There is appreciable variability in genome coverage both for
the deeply sequenced libraries and for the extrapolated low—
coverage libraries; this variability exists even for libraries origi—
nating in the same lab using the same protocol. In such cases our
method can help for selection of the best libraries to sequence
deep. This can help researchers in knowing the trade—off between
sequencing depth and observed loci prior to committing re—
sources for deep sequencing. This is particularly important for
studies involving single nucleotide variation that require deep
sequencing rather than broader variation such as copy number
variation. One ﬁeld where this is becoming increasingly import—
ant is full genome pre—implantation genetic diagnosis, which until
recently was considered impossible due to technological con—
straints (Geraedts and De Wert, 2009).

Finally, a major barrier to the development of new technolo—
gies or optimization of current protocols is the resources required
to compare genome coverage across libraries. Naive use of shal—
low test sequencing runs to compare libraries is often misleading,
as samples that initially appear to be high complexity may suffer
from large locus dropout (Supplementary Fig. 813). The method
we have presented can provide the information required for deep
evaluation of libraries without deep sequencing. Though we pre—
sented our analysis to the problem of sequencing single human
cells, the method is equally applicable to sequencing projects with
a reference genome from low (Parkinson et al., 2012) or highly
degraded (Priifer et al., 2014) input, bacterial samples with a
reference genome, or when mapping to a reference genome of
a closely related species with unknown overlap (Enk et al., 2014).

Abstract

Motivation: As the quantity of genomic mutation data increases, the likelihood of finding patients
with similar genomic profiles, for various disease inferences, increases. However, so does the diffi—
culty in identifying them. Similarity search based on patient mutation profiles can solve various
translational bioinformatics tasks, including prognostics and treatment efficacy predictions for bet—
ter clinical decision making through large volume of data. However, this is a challenging problem
due to heterogeneous and sparse characteristics of the mutation data as well as their high
dimensionality.

Results: To solve this problem we introduce a compact representation and search strategy based
on Gene—Ontology and orthogonal non—negative matrix factorization. Statistical significance be—
tween the identified cancer subtypes and their clinical features are computed for validation; results
show that our method can identify and characterize clinically meaningful tumor subtypes compar—
able or better in most datasets than the recently introduced Network—Based Stratification method
while enabling real—time search. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to simultan—
eously characterize and represent somatic mutational data for efficient search purposes.

1 Introduction

Due to advancements of genome scale sequencing data of patients,
sequencing will become a common practice in medicine (Kim et (11.,
2012, 2013, 2014; Stratton, 2011; Stuart and Sellers, 2009). In the
near future, the amount of patient records that include gene muta—
tion data will be huge. As the quantity of genomic mutation data in—
creases, the likelihood of finding patients with similar genomic
profiles, for various disease inferences, increases. However, so does
the difficulty in identifying them. Even with the significance of the
impact and need, genomic—based patient similarity searching has not
yet been actively studied by the bioinformatics community.

1.1 Types of genome data

Each type of genome data has different significance for each of the
disease. However, the most commonly studied data that are ex—
pected to be associated with many of the disease, other than the
gene expression, are the sequence mutation data. In the recent years,
huge numbers of tumor samples have been sequenced in large—scale
projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (The Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network at 111., 2013) and the International
Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) (Mardis, 2012; Watson et (11.,
2013). Due to the current limitations on the availability of patient
data, we focus on mutation data from cancer patients, because such

data are relatively abundant. However, the proposed method is not
limited to (somatic) mutations alone and can further be extended to
combine various types of genome data.

1.2 Somatic mutations and associated challenges
Somatic mutations are mutations that are not inherited from the
parents. Assuming that fewer somatic mutations occur in normal
cells than in cancer cells, a typical method to identify somatic mu—
tations in cancer patients is to find the differences between genome
sequences of normal tissues and cancer tissues (Greenman et (11.,
2007; Mardis, 2012; Watson et (11., 2013). Characterizing cancer
patients with somatic mutations is a natural process for cancer
studies because cancer is the result of massive disruption of genes
by various causes (Wang et (11., 2011; Dulak et (11., 2013). Note
that with other diseases, somatic mutations may not be as signifi—
cant as in cancer.

Somatic mutation data as well as other type of mutation data are
sparse in character. That is, compared with all possible mutations,
the actual number of mutations is small. Typically, 100—200 genes
have somatic mutations among 20 000+ human genes for a cancer
patient (Hofree et (11., 2013)). Also, for complex diseases, including
cancer, mutations are genetically heterogeneous (Marusyk et (11.,
2012)). That is, even for patients with similar clinical phenotype,
raw mutational profiles can be divergent. Various efforts have
focused on making sense of the heterogeneity, especially in cancer
data (Dulak et (11., 2013; Hofree et (11., 2013; Wang et (11., 2011).
However, for our purpose, we focus on reducing the effect of hetero—
geneity in the identification of similar patients.

1.3 Gene—Ontology and orthogonal non—negative

matrix factorization

The Gene—Ontology (GO) provides consistent and unified functional
descriptions of genes and gene products across databases, and is
used in various tasks including functional profiling of gene sets
(Dennis et (11., 2003; Khatri et (11., 2004). Typical GO applications
utilize terms at a particular depth in the GO hierarchy (Myers et (11.,
2006). However, such approach has the problem of biological terms
in different levels of the GO hierarchy (Lord at 111., 2003). Our
method includes a proposal to solve this problem.

In various contexts, NMF is a widely used method for various
clustering tasks and is known to be more accurate than other meth—
ods such as principal components analysis and singular vector de—
composition (Lee and Seung, 1999; Xu et (11., 2003). Orthogonal
NMF (ONMF) puts an orthogonal constraint on creation of the
basis vectors (or encoding vector) and is shown to improve the ac—
curacy of NMF in clustering (Ding, 2006). Besides the clustering
capability, NMF and ONMF have the potential for use in compact
representations. However, the capability of NMF and ONMF in
terms of indexing and searching in cancer genomics has not been
widely explored. In this work, we exploit both the clustering and the
representative capabilities of NMF and ONMF.

1.4 Characteristics of proposed method
The main characteristics of the proposed patient mutation profile
are as follows:

' Compact. The resulting patient mutation proﬁles have dimension
<10, the number of the subtypes, which varies according to can—
cer types. This also removes the sparsity problem.

' Enable real-time search. We can retrieve similar patients within
0.08 s using simulated data size of 10 000.

' Tolerant to heterogeneity. The resulting proﬁle shows tolerance
to genetic heterogeneity, and tolerance to difference in diagnostic
environments.

' Directness in function interpretation. Mutations map to GO
terms in which function interpretations can be made directly.

' High predictive power for clinical features. The cancer stratiﬁca—
tion results show it has high predictive power (or high correl—
ation) for clinical features (the histological basis feature or the
survival time) compared with Network—Based Stratiﬁcation
(NBS) (Hofree et (11., 2013).

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Overview of patient profile construction

and validation

The first step in patient profile generation (Fig. 1) is to extract muta—
tion profiles. We use somatic mutations to generate the mutation
profiles of cancer patients. For each patient, a mutation profile is
represented as a binary vector in which each entry is 1 if any of the
somatic mutations is present in the gene compared with germ line,
0 otherwise. Next, GO—based mutation profiles (GO—MP) are ob—
tained by multiplying the mutation profile matrix by the gene profile
matrix. The gene profile matrix is constructed based on the gene—
GO relationships. Each gene is represented as a binary vector in
which each entry indicates a binary state of the association between
gene and its GO terms. The inﬂuence of GO terms at non—leaf nodes
spreads to their descendant terms according to the GO hierarchy.
The influence spread is computed iteratively until only the GO terms
at the leaf nodes have non—zero entries. Finally, a compact ONMF
mutation profile (ONMF—MP), is obtained by using ONMF (Ding,
2006; Y00 and Choi, 2010) to factorize GO—MP and taking the
encoding matrix as the profile of the patients. In experiments, ana—
lysis of cancer stratification is conducted to verify the quality of
the proposed profiles, and top—k searches are performed with the
ONMF—MP to verify real—time search capability and search
characteristics.

2.2 Dataset

Somatic mutation information of level—2 exome and clinical data for
ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), glioblast—
oma multiforme (GBM) and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA)
from TCGA were downloaded and filtered. Data from patients that
have fewer than 10 mutations were discarded, because consistently
capturing relations among patients requires at least 10 mutations.
This filtering process left 441 patients with 12 431 genes for the 0V
data, 516 patients with 18 067 genes for the LUAD data, 247 pa—
tients with 20 446 genes for the UCEC data, 291 patients with 9341
genes for the GBM data and 772 patients with 13 078 genes for the
BRCA data.

2.3 Constructing mutation profiles

GO functional terms and ONMF are used to construct proposed
mutation profiles: GO—MPs and ONMF—MP5. Two major benefits
of GO—based representation are that it reduces the genetic hetero—
geneity and sparsity, and that it enables direct function interpret—
ation. The distinction of our approach in application of G0 is that
we take a genome—scale approach for GO—based function analysis in
construction of the proposed mutation profiles. That is, unlike typ—
ical function profiling methods, in which a small number of prese—
lected genes is analyzed to find the most relevant functional terms,

Validation Processes

Fig. 1. Overview of the patient profile construction and validation processes. The mutation profiles are represented as a binary vector in which each entry indicates a
binary state of a gene. The GO-based mutation profile matrix, X, is obtained by multiplying the mutation profile matrix, S, and the gene function profile matrix, G.
The ONMF mutation profile matrix, W, is obtained by factorizing GO-MPs through ONMF. For stratification, we assign the patients to the cluster that has the highest
value based on the encoding vector. For query search, the query profile is generated by minimizing reconstruction error between the mutation profile and the esti-
mated profile multiplied by latent basis vector, and patients who are similar to a given query patient are identified by calculating the Euclidean distance between

them and the query patient

we unbiasedly consider all genes during the analysis. Moreover, we
use the most specific functional terms, i.e. the leaf node terms, to
minimize the inter—correlations between terms. Benefits in using
ONMF are that it further reduces the heterogeneity and makes the
profile even more compact by separating out global signatures with
sample weights for the signatures. Details of construction are as
follows.

(Somatic) mutation profile, Spatiemxgme: For each patient, the mu—
tation profile 5,- is represented as a binary vector in which each entry
indicates the binary state of the gene; in case of somatic mutations, 1
if any of somatic mutations (i.e. a single—nucleotide base change and
the deletion/insertion of bases) has occurred in the gene compared
with the germ line (or normal tissue), 0 otherwise. As aforemen—
tioned, mutations occur heterogeneously even for patients with the
same cancer type, and the frequency of occurrence is slight making
the profile matrix S divergent and sparse.

Gene-function profile, Ggmexco: A gene—function profile is repre—
sented as a binary vector in which each entry indicates the binary
state on a gene; 1 if a gene is associated with the GO term (informa—
tion mapping gene sequence to accession number (gene2accession)
and gene to GO term (gene2go) are obtained from NCBI), 0 other—
wise. A GO term of a node is highly correlated with G0 terms of its
descendant nodes as well as its ancestor nodes due to its hierarchical
structure (The G0 hierarchy of biological processes (BPs) is from
GO version 2014—02—02; Ashburner et (11., 2000). To ensure that
only qualified GO terms are used, GO terms of ‘Non—traceable
Author Statement’ (NAS), ‘No biological Data available’ (ND) and
‘Not Recorded’ (NR) are ignored (Rhee et (11., 2008). To reduce the
term correlation, we use only the most specific terms, i.e. the leaf
node term after propagating the scores of the non—leaf terms down
to the leaf node terms. This approach also resolves the problem of
evaluating genes annotated with general term as the effect of the
gene of function identification is spread out over several leaf node
terms. We do this by defining an asymmetric adjacency matrix of
GO, MGO, where entry (1', /) indicates the parent(i)—child(/') relation—
ship, and only the diagonal entries of leaf nodes are 1. This matrix is
further normalized according to the node degree. Equation for the it—
erative inﬂuence propagation is as follows:

Gt+1ZGt ><MGO7 (1)

where G, is the gene profile matrix at the t—th iteration. This process
is repeated until Gt converges (usually within 15 iterations), then the
matrix entries of the non—leaf nodes become zero.

GO-based mutation profile (GO-MP), Xpatiemxco: The GO—MP
is generated as X’ : S X G, where S is the initial mutation profile ma—
trix and G is the gene—function profile matrix using ‘BP’ domain of
GO. By this process, each entry of a GO—MP becomes a weighted sum
of the gene contributions on each GO term. The rows of the resulting
X’ are further quantile normalized to X by enforcing the distribution
of the GO profiles to be identical. Using the mutation profile 5 with—
out the gene—function profile, Ggmxco, usually shows reduction in
the performance of the predictive power of clinical features
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, we have tested different combin—
ations of GO domains for generating gene—function profile matrix and
BP domain showed the most consist and accurate results compared
with other GO domain combinations (Supplementary Fig. S4).

ONMF mutation profile (ONMF-MP), Wpatiemxsubtym: The G0—
MP is further made compact by taking the encoding matrix W of
ONMF on X (Eq. 2) as profile vectors. This process reduces the
number of dimension of a patient profile to the number k of sub—
types while maintaining all information contained in H. Details are
provided in the next section.

2.4 Representation and stratification with ONMF

2.4.1 Non-negative matrix factorization

NMF factorizes a non—negative data matrix into non—negative basis
vectors and their non—subtractive combinations. Specifically, given
data matrix X with 71 observed data points {Xi}?:1, NMF seeks a de—
composition of X as follows:

XZWXH, (2)

where H contains basis vectors and W contains encoding vectors
that represent the extent to which each basis vector is used to recon—
struct each input vector. More speciﬁcally, based on randomly ini—
tialized matrices W and H, NMF ﬁnds the solution of
minHX — WHH2 : gig/(XL,- — [WHjHDZ by applying the multipli—
cative update rules (Lee and Seung, 1999):

where Xiﬁi : [XL-J- indicates (i,/')—th element of the matrix X.

2.4.2 Orthogonal NMF

ONMF puts an orthogonal constraint on the encoding matrix
(HHT : I) which generates signatures of subtypes that are orthog—
onal to each other. The ONMF allows emphasizing significant GO
terms for each subtype, which make the interpretation easier. Also,
ONMF have been shown to perform better than NMF for certain
cases (Ding, 2006). To solve the optimization problem with orthog—
onal constraint on H, the Lagrangian, [3, is used as follows:

1 1
ﬁzzllX—WHll2+Ztr{Q(HHT—I)}, (5)

Where Q is the symmetric matrix containing Lagrangian multipliers.
According to (Y00 and Choi, 2010), the multiplicative update rules
can be derived by using the true gradient on Stiefel manifold:

T
lW Xli,/

H-- _. H-- X —,
"’ "’ [HXTWHM

(6)

where the update rule of W follows Equation (3). ONMF allows
better interpretation of the factorized results and usually results in
better clustering quality (Ding, 2006; Y00 and Choi, 2010). The di—
mension of ONMF—MP is determined based on the performance of
the predictive power. For example, for UCEC and BRCA, the di—
mension used is four (Section 3.2.2).

2.4.3 Stratification and top-k search using ONMF

After factorizing X into the encoding matrix W and the basis matrix
H, we use the encoding matrix for cancer stratification. Specifically,
for stratification of patients into k—th subtypes, we assign patients X,-
to cluster [2* which has the highest value based on the encoding vec—
tor, as:

k* : arg mEx Wu, (7)

In this work, to enable reuses of factorized matrices and to allow for
real—time search capability, consensus clustering is not used. The di—
mension of ONMF—MP is determined based on the dimension that
resulted in the best performance in the predictive power test (Section
3.2.2). Stratification using K—means have been tested. However,
there were no significant differences in the results (Supplementary
Fig. S1) showing that the proposed profiles are not dependent on the
type of clustering methods used.

To retrieve top—k similar patients, it is required to compute
query—patient similarity scores in the ONMF—MP. Thus we compare
the vectors in the encoding matrix W with the ONMF—MP of a
query patient, W; : mian(q — W,, X H), where q is the GO—MP of a
query patient. It is used to seek patients who are similar to a given
query patient by calculating the Euclidean distance between the
query profile and patient profiles in the database.

2.5 Search performance validation

We validated the proposed profiles using accuracy measures and
speed calculation of top—k search results. In a top—k search, we used
the similarity of clinical profiles to determine whether the search re—
sults are correct. Clinical profiles were constructed based on a set of
clinical features that have statistically significant correlation with
the cancer subtypes. Statistical significance was evaluated by the

P value of log—rank test for the cancer subtypes on clinical features.
We considered P value $0.05 as significant.

Two types of clinical profiles were tested: profiles with single
clinical feature and profiles with combinations of clinical features.
The accuracy of top—k search using single features was computed by
dividing the number of patients retrieved with the same clinical fea—
ture to that of the query patient by k, the number of patients
searched. Overall accuracy of the dataset was computed by taking
the average of the leave—one—out top—k search accuracies. Accuracy
calculation using combination of clinical features was conducted
similarly, except that two patients are determined as similar when
the number of overlapped features over the entire number of fea—
tures is larger than or equal to the threshold 0%.

3 Results

3.1 Search accuracy and speed

In this section, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed profile
by accessing its accuracy and speed measurement on the top—k search
results using the ONMF—MP. The accuracy of ONMF—MP based top—
]: search was validated by empirical examination of search results and
calculation of average search accuracy. The search speed was com—
puted on expanded data to simulate a ‘big data’ search scenario.

3.1.1 Top-k search accuracy

We first looked at empirical examples of the search results on
OV, LUAD, UCEC, GBM and BRCA data. We found examples of
clinically meaningful similarities using the ONMF—MP for all five
datasets. Table 1 shows selected examples of query patient and their
top—1 search results with list of similar or same clinical features
between the query and the top—1 retrieval.

Next, we systematically evaluated the retrieval accuracies as
described in the Section 2.5. In the experiment, a leave—one—out test of
top—1 and top—10 nearest neighbor search was conducted on UCEC
and BRCA data. The dimension of ONMF—MP that we used for both
UCEC and BRCA data is four, which showed the best performance in
the predictive power (Section 3.2.2). Experiments for OV, LUAD,
and GBM are not provided due to insufficient clinical information.
That is, the clinical features provided in TCGA for the three cancer
types had too many missing values or were extremely skewed.

We calucluated the accuracy based on single clinical feature
that had the best correlation with all compared methods. Using
ONMF—MP on UCEC data, 79.04% of the patients had same

histological types as their top—1 similar patient, and on average
65.83% of the patients had the same histological types as their top—
10 patients. In contrast, the accuracy of GO—MP was 42.74% and
65.44% comparing top—1 and top—10, respectively. This shows that
the ONMF—MP finds latent GO relationship among similar patients
with reduced sensitivity to experimental environment than does
GO—MP. According to the top—k search on the ONMF—MP on
BRCA data, 73.42% of top—1 similar patients had the same estrogen
receptor status. In contrast to that of UCEC data, GO—MP was more
accurate than ONMF—MP (76.01%). However, using ONMF—MP,
80.39% of top—10 similar patients had the same clinical feature
whereas only 77.78% were the same using GO—MP.

As a second systematic experiment, a combination of clinical fea—
tures was used as truth—values of the search results for retrieving simi—
lar patients using raw somatic mutation profile, GO—MP and ONMF—
MP. Again, only UCEC and BRCA data were used. For the clinical
features of the UCEC, histological type, pathological grade, residual,
and histICD03 were used. For clinical features of the BRCA, histolo—
gical type, estrogen status, progesterone status and margin status were
used (the descriptions of the clinical features are provided at https://
tcga—data.nci.nih.gov/docs/dictionary/). The accuracy of top—10 near—
est neighbor search on the three profiles shows that GO—MP and
ONMF—MP improve the accuracy in finding clinically similar patients
compared with raw somatic mutation profiles (Table 2).

3.1.2 Search speed and compactness

Profiles of the OV, LUAD, UCEC, GBM and BRCA, were expanded
in order to simulate top—k search in a large dataset. The size of clin—
ical bio—data continues to grow. However, it is still not large (£500)
enough to verify the top—k search efficiency of the proposed method
in a ‘big data’ scenario. The simulated datasets were created by it—
eratively combining a randomly selected pair of profiles to create a
new profile until we had 10 000 profiles for each cancer types.
The speedup from mutation profile (dim. 222 000) to GO—MP (dim.
23000) and then to the final ONMF—MP (dim. $10) is not surpris—
ing because each step is basically a dimension reduction step
(Table 3). Also, the speed improvement is expected to be more dras—
tic when the dataset size increases, since the search process included
the profile generation of the query data that takes up a constant fac—
tor of time (data not shown).

3.2 Validation of cancer stratification

We verified the accuracy of the proposed profile by performing can—
cer stratification experiments and showing meaningful associations
between the resulting subtypes and clinical features. We performed
stratification tests using GO—MP and matrix decomposition methods
NMF and ONMF, and compared the results to that of a recently
introduced method called NBS (Hofree et (11., 2013). NBS is a cancer
stratification method that uses gene—gene networks to propagate the
effect of somatic mutations across affected genes and their associ—
ated genes. We ran NBS using default parameters and gene—gene net—
work on which NBS performed best, i.e. STRING (Szklarczyk et (11.,
2011) for UCEC and HumanNet (Lee et (11., 2011) for OV, LUAD,

GBM and BRCA (information mapping gene sequence to accession
number (gene2accession) and gene to GO term (gene2go) are ob—
tained from NCBI). After stratification, selected subtypes were vali—
dated using two criteria: survival curves and predictive power. To be
as fair as possible, we compared results only for the number of sub—
types that are the most favorable to NBS as indicated by the log—
rank test or the  test and P value combination for each dataset.

3.2.1 Survival analysis

We performed survival analysis for each subtype using the Cox pro—
portional hazards regression model (Fan and Li, 2002) implemented
in the R survival package (Therneau, 1999). We compare a full
model consisting of subtypes and clinical features against a baseline
model that consists of clinical features only. The following clinical
features were used for analysis of OV and GBM datasets: age, gen—
der, clinical stage, histologic grade/type and residual surgical resec—
tion. In addition to those features, smoking history was used in the
LUAD dataset. Analysis for UCEC and BRCA dataset were omitted
due to highly skewed death rates.

The log—rank statistics and associated P values were computed to
compare survival distributions (or hazard functions) of two sample
sets that are right—censored. Based on the best log—rank statistics, the
ONMF result was more statistically significant than NBS result in
two of three datasets. That is, on LUAD dataset, the best log—rank
statistics value of ONMF, 71.26, was higher than that of NBS, 69.15
(Fig. 2B). Likewise, the best log—rank statistics value of NMF, 36.79,
was slightly higher than that of NBS, 36.12 (Fig. 2C). Following the
number of subtypes according to the highest log—rank statistics of
NBS (Fig. 2A—C), we use results that stratify dataset to two subtypes
for OV, eight for LUAD and four for GBM dataset, in the following
analyses. Figure 2D—F shows the boxplots of the least aggressive sub—
type (max) and the most aggressive cancer subtype (min) based on the
median survival time. Overall, the three approaches were comparable
in that median survival time of the least and the most aggressive sub—
types were in similar ranges. Examination shows that ONMF—MP is
better at identifying the subtypes with patients having longer survival
time for LUAD (Fig. 2E) and GBM (Fig. 2F) compared With NBS and
NMF. Also, looking at survival time range, NBS assigned some pa—

for OV (Fig. 2D) and LUAD (Fig. 2E).

Figure 3 shows the survival curve of patients in the min/max sub—
types. The survival curves of all the subtypes are provided in the
Supplementary Figure S3. In OV, the three survival curves showed
similar pattern for the all three approaches. In LUAD, the all three
methods showed clear separation between the maximum survival
group and the minimal survival group. However, NBS produced in—
accurate survival curves in which the min subtype shows longer sur—
vival pattern than the max subtype. In GBM data, NBS was
successful at grouping the min survival whereas ONMF was better at
grouping the max survival. Overall, the identified subtypes are good
indicators of patient survival time (Figs 2D—F and 3). According to

the result, NMF and ONMF showed comparable results to that of
NBS, and ONMF shows the best stability (Fig. 2A—C).

3.2.2 Predictive power
To verify the biological importance of the identified subtypes, we
conducted experiments to investigate whether the identified sub—
types are predictive of the observed clinical features. Statistical sig—
nificance between the subtypes was evaluated using Pearson’s 
test, and associated P values were calculated when survival analysis
is not possible due to biased death rates. The predictive power of
clinical features was evaluated for UCEC and BRCA data and omit—
ted for OV, LUAD and GBM data again due to biased death rates.
To analyze the predictive power of ONMF—MP on UCEC data,
six clinical features were generated. The features were created based
on histological basis (two histologic grades times three histological

types). The identified subtypes extracted by our method were more
closely associated with the clinical feature than NBS according to
the best 32 and P value combination (Table 4).

Also, the distribution of the features of the identified subtypes by
ONMF—MP, evaluated on stratification that results in three sub—
types, showed a clear distinction between subtypes (Fig. 4). That is,
most patients with serous adenocarcinoma and high histological
grade were included in the first subtype, patients with low histolo—
gical grade were included in the second and third subtypes, and the
patients with the combination of endometrioid type and high grade
were included in the second subtype.

Predictive power of estrogen receptor status, which is catego—
rized as intermediate, negative and positive, were evaluated on
BRCA data (Table 5). The estrogen receptor status was highly corre—
lated with the extracted subtypes by GO—MP and ONMF—MP. In
addition, ONMF—MP produced subtypes with the highest correl—
ations to the clinical features even for highly skewed features. Also,
the  values of ONMF—MP were larger than NBS and GO—MP in
predicting histologic type, which is categorized in to three feature
values that are highly skewed to ‘infiltrating lobular carcinoma
(IDC)’ (82% of the samples). That is, only ONMF—MP was

4 Conclusion

We proposed a compact representation for genome mutation. This
representation is called the ONMF mutation profile (ONMF—MP); it
is used for efficient search and characterization of patients’ genome
data, and provides basic information for many data mining tasks in
translational bioinformatics. The ONMF—MP uses ONMP to exploit
the functional representation property of GO and the ability to correl—
ate GO terms that are latent in a collection of genome mutation data.
This representation solves the sparsity problem of mutation data and
achieves reduced sensitivity to heterogeneous factors; it also enables
genome—based real—time search for similar patients. We show experi—
mentally that stratification results using the proposed representation
have comparable or better correlations with clinical features than do
those achieved using a recently introduced method. Insufficient clin—
ical information prevents us from using the all five cancer types for
the two the validation test to make the validation complete. However,
this is not an inherent charateristic of the data and we expect that
more data accumulation will evidentially resolve this problem. We
also show that the representation can search through millions of pa—
tients in milliseconds.

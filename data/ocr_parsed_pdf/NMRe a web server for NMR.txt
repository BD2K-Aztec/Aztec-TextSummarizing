Abstract

Summary: Protein structure refinement is a necessary step for the study of protein function. In par—
ticular, some nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures are of lower quality than X—ray crystal—
lographic structures. Here, we present NMRe, a web—based server for NMR structure refinement.
The previously developed knowledge—based energy function STAP (Statistical Torsion Angle
Potential) was used for NMRe refinement. With STAP, NMRe provides two refinement protocols
using two types of distance restraints. If a user provides NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) data, the
refinement is performed with the NOE distance restraints as a conventional NMR structure refine—
ment. Additionally, NMRe generates NOE—like distance restraints based on the inter—hydrogen dis—
tances derived from the input structure. The efficiency of NM Re refinement was validated on 20 NMR
structures. Most of the quality assessment scores of the refined NMR structures were better than
those of the original structures. The refinement results are provided as a three—dimensional structure
view, a secondary structure scheme, and numerical and graphical structure validation scores.

The determination of three—dimensional (3D) protein structures is
an important challenge in structural biology because structure is
closely related to function. NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)
spectroscopy is one method of protein structure determination, and
it also provides information about the dynamics of proteins.
However, protein structures determined by NMR spectroscopy are
of lower quality than X—ray structures. Thus, refinement is a neces—
sary step in NMR structure study. Three NMR structure refinement
databases have been constructed: DRESS (a Database of REfined
Solution NMR Structures; Nabuurs et (11., 2004), RECOORD

STAP (Statistical Torsion Angle Potential; Yang et (11., 2012). NMR
structure refinement using the NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect)
distance data obtained by NMR is performed in many refinement
studies (Bertini et (11., 2011; Chen et (11., 2004; Mao et (11., 2014).
However, NOE distance data exist in various formats, such as
CYANA, CNS and XPLOR. Therefore, NOE data manipulation is
difficult for general researchers. Another problem in improving
NMR structures is the ambiguity and sparseness of NOE data
(Nilges, 1997). The NMRe web server provides simple and fast
NMR structure refinement with NOE—like distance data using the

inter—hydrogen distance restraints obtained from a given original
structure. Conventional refinement is also performed using NOE
distance data in the XPLOR/CYANA format. For acquiring better
structure validation scores during the refinement process, a know—
ledge—based energy function (STAP) is added into the target energy
potential. We expect the NMRe web server will contribute to NMR
structure studies by providing accurate refinements.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Two developed energy potentials

The STAP is a grid—type, knowledge—based energy potential that
focuses on the torsion angle combinations ((p—i/I, (p—x1, i/I—x1 and x1—
x2) of high—resolution X—ray structures under 2.0A (Kim et (11.,
2013). The efficiency of STAP was demonstrated in earlier studies
via NMR structure refinement (Yang et (11., 2012). Another energy
potential is the structure—derived distance potential, which was gen—
erated by inter—hydrogen distances below 7A obtained from a given
NMR structure, and this potential has greatly enhanced NMR struc—
ture refinement without experimental information (Ryu et (11.,
2014). The potential functions consisted of two parameters: the
equilibrium distance of two interacting hydrogen atoms and widths
from 0 to 10A at 1A intervals. In a previous study, we found that
the optimal width parameter is 4  The optimal width is the default
width for NMRe refinement calculations. This potential function
prevents serious deviation from the current state of the original
structure during the refinement.

2.2 Running a refinement

Whole process of NMRe refinement is shown in Figure 1A. First,
NMRe converts the input Protein Data Bank (PDB) file into a
CHARMM—readable format and all ensemble structures are sepa—
rated for simulation. Then, the ‘NMRe_dist’ is performed with dis—
tance restraints obtained from the given input PDB structure. When
a user optionally uploads the NOE restraint file, the ‘NMRe_noe’ is
performed with ‘NMRe_dist’. In the ‘NMRe_noe’, the uploaded
NOE file is used to generate the restraining potential of CHARMM
(Brooks et (11., 2009). The simulated annealing (SA) simulation is
conducted with the CHARMM default energy and the EEF1.1 solv—
ation energy (Lazaridis and Karplus, 1999) using CHARMM (see
the Supplementary Information for more information). After refine—
ment, NMRe evaluates structural quality to compare the refined
structure and the original structure using structure validation scores.

3 Results

NMRe refinement was tested on 20 structures obtained from PDB
that have both NMR and X—ray structures (Supplementary Table S1).
The X—ray structures were used as a reference for measuring back—
bone similarity. The structure quality was measured using backbone
similarity, NOE violation and structure validation scores
(Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). In the
‘NMRe_dist’, the TM—score was increased from 0.79 to 0.80, and
three energy scores (DOPE, nDOPE and dDFIRE) were stabilized.
The clash score was also improved from 53.81 to 0.40. The
Ramachandran score and several parameters of the WHAT_CHECK
Z—score were significantly improved in the ‘NMRe_noe’. In particu—
lar, the PROCHECK Ramachandran score was improved from 80.98
to 95.36. In Supplementary Table S3, comprehensive NOE restraint
violations were reported. The number of violated NOE, Root Mean
Square Deviation (RMSD) and Maximum NOE violation were im—
proved in ‘NMRe_noe’. However, ‘NMRe_dist’ has a slightly
increased NOE restraints violation in comparison with original.
Because the experimental measurement of NOE distance may have a
distance error (Nilges, 1997) of ~0.5—1.0 A, these results are not re—
garded as a serious defect. Additionally, we demonstrated that dihe—
dral angle restraints do not contribute much in this protocol
(Supplementary Table S5). One of example target (2L4S) and com—
parison of the performance between the NMRe and other known
refinement protocols are described in Supplementary Information.

4 Web server

NMRe uses PDB formats as an input 3D structure, and a NOE
restraint is optional. The XPLOR or CYANA format is allowed.
NMRe provides outputs in four ways (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Fig. S4) and is presented in the ‘Analysis’ page of the status table.
The 3D structure viewer shows structural changes caused by the re—
finement simulation. The secondary structure scheme presents the
creation of the secondary structure, and when a user clicks on the
secondary structure shape, it is highlighted in the 3D structure
viewer. The ‘Structural scores’ table shows the structure validation
scores used to quantify the quality of various protein structure prop—
erties. The structure validation scores of the original/refined struc—
tures are compared with the normalized structure validation scores
of 18 347 X—ray structures in a radar chart (Fig. 1B). The shaded re—
gion of the chart indicates greater quality than an average X—ray
structure (upper 50% in structure quality). The refined structures
can be downloaded through download links.

format, this information was incorporated into the model as a
Boolean value. The STRING database scores an association probability
between two proteins, with a score of 0.4 deﬁned as medium conﬁdence.
To convert this probability into a Boolean value we deﬁned cutoff
probabilities, such that given some cutoff 6, any association with a
probability :6 was classiﬁed as true, and any association with a prob-
ability <6 was classiﬁed as false. We tested three cutoff probabilities,
starting at the medium conﬁdence level of 0.4 and increasing in incre-
ments of 0.2. We found that a cutoff probability of 0.6 provided the best
overall performance (Supplementary Table S1), and is the cutoff used in
this work.

To identify relevant connections between kinases and PPI events, the
following steps were taken. Substrates were ﬁrst grouped according to
their kinase (one substrate could be assigned to multiple kinases).
BioGRID was then searched for proteins that interacted both with a
substrate and with its kinaseithese proteins were added to a pool of
potential protein interaction connections. For each kinase, the proteins in
the pool were ranked in descending order according to the number of
interactions that were observed with the kinase’s substrates. An observa-
tion is deﬁned as a substrateiprotein interaction occurring in BioGRID
and/or the STRING database. A count 6 was deﬁned, so that for each
kinase only the top 6 protein interactions were used to form connections.
To ensure that there would be enough observations of substrate-protein
interactions for setting model parameters, a lower bound of 10 was set
such that for a given kinase, at least 10 substrat&protein observations
were required for the protein to be considered as a connection to that
kinase. We tested three different upper bounds of c: 25, 40 and 50 to
determine the effect of varying sized interaction networks on prediction
performance.

2.2.3 Protein cell—cycle data. In order to model the availability of
substrates during the cell cycle, we used data obtained from the
experiments by Olsen et a]. (2010), who measured the abundance of pro-
teins at six stages throughout the cell cycleiM phase, G1 phase, the
transition between G1 and S phase (G1 /S), early S phase, late S phase
and G2 phase. An asynchronous population of cells was also measured,
and the signal used to log normalize the measurements from the cells
arrested during the six stages. A protein with a value of 0 during a
stage of the cell cycle has an abundance equivalent to the asynchronous
population, whereas a negative value indicates downregulation and a
positive value indicates upregulation. To avoid ﬁtting the model
too strongly to data generated from a single cell type, we represented
proteins’ cell-cycle proﬁles in a simple binary format across four
stagesiM, G1, S and G2. We collapsed the G1 and Gl/S stages in
to the single variable ‘G1’ and the early S and late S stages into the
variable ‘S’. If a protein has a value greater than 0 that stage is labelled
as true; otherwise it is labelled as false. The G1 and S variables were set to
true if at least one of their respective collapsed stages had a value greater
than 0.

2.3 Model parameters and training

The variables in the network were represented with two kinds of prob-
ability tables. A conditional probability table (CPT) represents all pos-
sible values that a variable X can take given the set of parents, pa(X), it is
conditioned on. Parameters are set during training by calculating the
frequency of occurrence of all possible conﬁgurations of pa(X). If X
does not have parents, the CPT simply represents the observed frequency
from training data of X being true.

For situations where a variable is conditioned on greater than six
parents, we used a variation of the Noisy-OR approximation (Onisko
et al., 2001). In order to set the parameters of the Noisy-OR table
during training, each row (representing a parent variable) in the table
was calculated as follows: each training sample where the parent is

observed as being true was identiﬁed. A weighted frequency for each
parent pa was calculated such that

1 " t
freqvm) n  ((t +f)pconf,»)’

where n is the number of conﬁgurations of parent variables where pa is
observed to be true, pconf, is the number of parents set to true in conﬁg-
uration i, t is the count of the variable the Noisy-OR node is representing
being true during the ith conﬁguration of parents and f is the count of it
being false.

For the latent variable, and variables that are conditioned on it, par-
ameters are calculated using the expectation-maximization algorithm on a
training set (Do and Batzoglou, 2008).

2.4 Evaluation and deﬁnition of negative test sets

A common problem to phosphorylation site prediction is that of deﬁning
a negative test set (Trost and Kusalik, 2011). However, as our model is
not trained using sequence data, we were able to use a sequence scoring
method to deﬁne negative test sets for each of the 59 kinases in the model.
To score protein sequences for kinase binding sites, we used the Predikin
web server (Ellis and Kobe, 2011) to obtain position weight matrices
(PWMs) for 53 of the kinases in the model. For the remaining six we
constructed PWMs using phosphorylation sites from curated data
(Supplementary Methods S1.1). For a given kinase, we scored each
substrate in the training data set by obtaining the highest scoring
potential phosphorylation site. We then ranked the substrates based on
the highest scoring site from lowest to highest, and assigned an equal
number of positive and negative substrates for that kinase. As very low
scores indicate a protein that the kinase cannot phosphorylate, this
gives us a high-conﬁdence negative test set for each of the kinases in
the model.

We evaluated the model for each kinase for its ability to correctly
predict known substrates compared with the negative set. To score the
probability of a kinase phosphorylating a query protein, all nodes in the
network were set according to the relevant data for the query protein
except for the kinase that we were inferring. Model performance was
evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis by
calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Baldi et al., 2000).
We used 15-fold cross validation, and performed the cross validation 10
times with different data set splits. To avoid the possibility of the
model gaining information about the test data during training, we
ensured that each protein interaction variable was only connected to a
kinase if, within the training fold, there were 10 (our previously deﬁned
lower bound) or more kinase substrates interacting with that protein.
The data sets used to train and test the model are available in the
Supplementary material.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Model performance for predicting kinase substrates

We generated five BN models by grouping kinases according to
their family similarities (Manning et al., 2002): CMGC, AGC,
TK, CAMK and a combined model that incorporated kinases
from the CKl, STE, atypical and other families. We tested the
ability of the model to classify kinase substrates with varying
numbers of protein interaction connections, and under three con—
ditions. To gauge the level of inﬂuence that substrate abundance
during the cell cycle has on prediction performance, we evaluated
a version of the model excluding the cell—cycle variables (PPI only
model), and compared the performance to the full model. When
making inferences about a kinase—substrate phosphorylation

event, the model relies on the knowledge of other potential kin—
ases phosphorylating that substrate. However, for the majority
of proteins there is little, if any, experimental information on any
known kinase—speciﬁc phosphorylation events. Therefore, to de—
termine whether the model could be reliably extended to the
wider proteome, we tested model performance when setting
non—query kinase nodes to false on the basis of their sequence
binding motifs (Supplementary Methods $12).

The AUC results (Table l) for 10 cross—validation runs eval—
uated on all 59 kinases in the model for the three different con—
ditions demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the full
model is quite high, with most kinases having median AUCs
surpassing 0.8. The average AUC over all of the kinases is
0.86. The generally low—standard deviation indicates that these
results are consistent regardless of the breakup of training/test
data that is presented to the model. We tested three different
values for maximum number of protein interactions that could
be connected to a kinase variable (25, 40 and 50), but found that
increasing the number of protein interaction events connected to
the kinase variables had very little effect on the performance of
the model (Supplementary Table S2), indicating the model’s abil—
ity to make classiﬁcations based on a relatively small number of
connections to the individual kinase nodes.

When comparing the performance of the PPI only model to
the full model, we found that on average the inclusion of protein
abundance data collected across the cell cycle offered modest
improvements to prediction performance. For some kinases
there was a greater performance improvementifor example a
15% increase for PRKC kinases, a nearly 10% increase for the
tyrosine kinase CSKibut for many other kinases the inclusion
of cell—cycle data seemed to have little effect. This demonstrates
that while the PPI data provide the main source of information
for the model, the use of cell—cycle data can offer improved
prediction performance for some kinases. This performance
increase occurs despite the fact that we only have cell—cycle
data for less than half of the substrates in our set: the model
infers the cell—cycle profiles for the remaining proteins. This
indicates that the model, when trained on cell—cycle data, can
still be applied to query proteins that have no associated cell—
cycle data.

Table 1 also shows a comparison between setting the kinase
nodes with database (“Full model”) versus sequence information
(“Seq approx”). We found that for many kinases, using se—
quence to set the kinase nodes actually resulted in an increase
in performance. The median AUC for the CMGC kinases went
from 0.87 using database information to 0.91 using sequence,
and the median AUC for the tyrosine kinases increased from
0.88 to 0.94.

The possibility was raised that as the kinase—substrate data
from HPRD and Phospho.ELM is sourced from the literature,
and the STRING database also includes text mining from the
literature, a system of circular logic could be inﬂating the per—
formance values. To determine whether such an effect was occur—
ring, we re—ran our simulations for each kinase with the text
mining information for that kinase removed (Supplementary
Methods $13). We found that while for some kinases this infor—
mation appeared to have a large impact on prediction capability,
it was not the case for the majority of kinases (Supplementary
Table S3).

replication during the S phase (Attwoll et al., 2004; Lammens
et al., 2009; Biswas and Johnson, 2012). The E2F family is com—
prised of three classes of TFs: transcriptional activators, retino—
blastoma (Rb)—dependent repressors, and Rb—independent
repressors. What is currently lacking is an understanding of
what specific roles in the S phase are controlled at transcriptional
level by E2F, and at the post—translational level by CDK2.

In order to investigate what overlapping functions may exist
between E2F—regulated transcription and CDK2—mediated phos—
phorylation, we took ChIP—Seq data (ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2012) for E2F1 (activator), E2F4 (Rb—dependent re—
pressor) and E2F6 (Rb—independent repressor). Supplementary
Figure S1 shows a Venn diagram of the unique and overlapping
gene targets that exist among the three TFs (Supplementary
Methods $16). It has been shown previously that overlapping
targets between E2F1 and E2F4 are enriched in DNA replication
and repair GO terms (Lee et al., 2011). We found that the over—
lapping targets of all three TFs are also enriched in such GO
terms.

We then combined our set of predicted CDK2 substrates with
known CDK2 substrates and identiﬁed proteins from this com—
bined set of substrates that were in the unique and overlapping
groups of E2F targets. GO enrichment tests were performed with
the CDK2 substrates as the foreground and the remainder of the
TF target group as the background. This allowed us to detect
what role CDK2 plays within these TF target groups.
Supplementary Tables S87S14 contain the GO terms found to
be signiﬁcantly overrepresented (E—value <0.05) among CDK2
substrates in the TF target groups. While we found signiﬁcantly
overrepresented GO terms in all TF target groups, we noticed a
larger number of process—speciﬁc terms among the unique E2F1
targets (Supplementary Table S8), unique E2F6 targets
(Supplementary Table S9) and the overlapping targets among
all three TFs (Supplementary Table S11). We found that
CDK2 substrates among unique E2F1 targets and unique
E2F6 targets were enriched in several terms relating to the regu—
lation of apoptosis, as well as ubiquitination. Substrates in the
overlapping group of targets of all three TFs were enriched in
terms relating to DNA replication and DNA damage repair.

4 DISCUSSION

Protein phosphorylation is a highly regulated process, being con—
trolled by the binding speciﬁcity to the protein kinase catalytic
site, as well as various cellular processes that further enhance the
kinase—substrate ﬁdelity (Kobe et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005). We
have demonstrated how a probabilistic model of PPIs and cell—
cycle data can be used to accurately classify kinase substrates.
Importantly, we found that our model, when combined with
sequence—operating methods, was able to improve the accuracy
of kinase—specific phosphorylation site prediction at false—positive
levels below 0.002 for tyrosine kinases and below 0.0005 for
serine/threonine kinases.

One potential point of concern in this approach is that we only
had access to cell—cycle data for a single cell type, and whether this
could result in a tissue—specific inﬂuence that impeded predictions
in some cell types. However, as the phosphorylation site data we
obtained from Phospho.ELM originates from multiple cell types
[including, for example, HeLa cells (Wells and Hickson, 1995;

Kraft et al., 2003), HEK 293T cells (Johnson et al., 1999),
MELN cells (Medunjanin et al., 2005) and T98G glioma cells
(Hansen et al., 2001)], the performance of the model across
these varying cell types validates the appropriateness of the data
we used. We attribute this largely to the simple representation of
the cell—cycle data as four Boolean variables, which would be un—
likely to result in a cell type—speciﬁc bias. Somewhat counterintui—
tively, we found that the cell—cycle data did not improve prediction
performance for the CDKsikinases whose activity is strongly
linked to cell—cycle progressioniwhile offering performance in—
crease to other kinases. Though this study focussed on the use of
protein abundance data for representing protein cell—cycle pro—
ﬁles, we note that dynamic gene—expression data across the cell—
cycle also exists for human proteins (Gauthier et al., 2010).
Further study could investigate what inﬂuence dynamic gene—ex—
pression data can provide to kinase—substrate prediction.

We observed some variations among the performance evalu—
ations for the individual kinases, indicating that the model works
better on certain kinases. However, we found that the perform—
ance for prediction of kinase substrates (Table 1) was not neces—
sarily an indicator of what improvement would be seen when
applying the model to phosphorylation site prediction. For ex—
ample, the PhosphoPICK algorithm had excellent performance
when classifying tyrosine kinase substratesiin several cases with
AUCs greater than 0.9. However, when predicting phosphoryl—
ation sites of tyrosine kinases using Predikin and GPS, we found
that the prediction of tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites ben—
eﬁtted the least from the addition of the PhosphoPICK score,
and the score appeared to be detrimental to predictions made by
NetworKIN.

The kinase family where PhosphoPICK consistently demon—
strated the most powerful prediction performance was the
CMGC familyiprincipally CDK and MAPK kinases. We
found that PhosphoPICK generally improved the prediction of
phosphorylation sites for the CMGC kinases as tested across
each of the three methods, though there were some cases
where PhosphoPICK resulted in a decrease in the accuracy of
NetworKIN predictions. As the kinases in these families have
very similar binding patterns, it is likely that mediating proteins
captured by the PhosphoPICK model make a greater contribu—
tion in the correct assignment of a kinase to a substrate. These
results lend support to the intuitive notion that the addition of
context information would support sequence—based predictions
most powerfully when the kinase binding patterns are less spe—
ciﬁc, or are very similar among family membersior both, as is
the case with CDK and MAPK kinases.

It was interesting to note that the putative CDK2 substrates
within the overlapping E2F1, E2F4 and E2F6 targets groups
were overrepresented with G0 terms related to DNA replication
and DNA damage repair. Considering this group of genes was
itself already enriched in such terms (when compared with the
proteome), this underscores the importance that CDK2 has in
regulating DNA replication and DNA damage repair (Deans
et al., 2006; Satyanarayana and Kaldis, 2009). There are several
potential responses to DNA damage, but in some cases cells may
undergo apoptosis (Zhou and Elledge, 2000; Bakkenist and
Kastan, 2004). We also noticed that putative CDK2 substrates
within the unique E2F1 and E2F6 target groups were both
overrepresented with terms relating to the regulation of

apoptosis and ubiquitination. These are both processes that
CDK2 has previously been implicated in (Hayami et al., 2005;
Huang et al., 2006), and ubiquitination is also known to play an
important role in regulating apoptotic proteins (Zhang et al.,
2004). E2F1 is known to be a regulator of apoptosis
(DeGregori et al., 1997), and similarly E2F6 can negatively regu—
late apoptosis (Yang et al., 2006), so it was interesting to ﬁnd
that the putative CDK2 substrates within the unique E2F1 and
E2F6 target groups were enriched in apoptosis and ubiquitina—
tion GO terms. These results seem to suggest a dynamic regula—
tory interplay between the E2F family at the transcriptional level,
and the CDK2 kinase at the post—translational level.

This clustering technique did not require the multidimensional scaling
used in the previous work.

2.3 Centrality measures (network topology)

In Edberg et al. (2012), the relative importance of the proteins
(represented as nodes in a network) for a single chemical was modelled
by the centrality measures: betweenness, node degree, edge percolation
component and bottleneck betweenness. These were matched or approxi-
mated in the R package igraph (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) by the func-
tions degree (number of connections to a node), betweenness (number of
shortest paths through a node) and subgraphcentrality (number of
subgraphs with a node, weighted by size of subgraph) based on compu-
tational similarity and rank correlation for a number of test compounds
(unpublished data).

3 RESULTS

The QuantMap group of tools, encompassing QuantMap Prep
and QuantMap Server, are available from the main menu of our
Galaxy server (http://galaxy.predpharmtox.org). A list of chem—
icals identiﬁed by name or CID can be loaded into the text field
of QuantMap Prep, which checks the names for applicability to
the system. QuantMap Server is then run from the result of the
preparation job. All chemicals with adequate PPI (according to
step 2 of Section 2.2) will be used to produce a plot of the bio—
logical interrelationships.

We demonstrate the automated QuantMap system using a
dataset identical to the one used by Edberg et a]. (2012), specif—
ically for Estradiol, Diethylstilbestrol, Tamoxifen, Raloxifene,
Fulvestrant, Genistein, Coumestrol, Resveratrol, Bisphenol A,
4—Nonylphenol, Dibutyl phthalate, Zearalenone, Endosulfan,
Glimepiride, Rosiglitazone, Aspirin, Ibuprofen and Diclofenac.

The dendrogram of Figure 1 shows the results of QuantMap
Server applied to this dataset. Qualitatively, this figure is largely
equivalent to the results by Edberg, such as the lone dibutyl
phthalate and groupings of NSAIDs (Aspirin, Diclofenac
and Ibuprofen) and antidiabetic drugs (Glimepiride and
Rosiglitazone). The other compounds form a more complex pat—
tern similar, but not identical, to the previous work. Differences
could be due to the use of different centrality measures, as
described earlier in the text. See Edberg et a]. (2012) for a general
discussion of the results.

The execution time for this analysis was on the order of a few
seconds. The speed advantage over a partially manual procedure
is considerable. The possibility to create workﬂows in Galaxy
and other types of automation compounds the beneﬁts to help
make this automated QuantMap system more practical and
accessible.

Fig. 1. Dendrogram produced by QuantMap Server from the dataset
used in this study. The compound list was run through QuantMap
Prep to make a data table for QuantMap Server. Compounds separated
by fewer branches are more similar to each other from a biological, rather
than chemical, perspective. For cleaner display, short branches were
ﬂattened to approximate multibranching with di2multi in APE (Paradis
et al., 2004)

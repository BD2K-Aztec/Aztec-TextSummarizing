ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gain-of-function mutations often cluster in specific pro-
tein regions, a signal that those mutations provide an adaptive advan-
tage to cancer cells and consequently are positively selected during
clonal evolution of tumours. We sought to determine the overall extent
of this feature in cancer and the possibility to use this feature to identify
drivers.

Results: We have developed OncodriveCLUST, a method to identify
genes with a significant bias towards mutation clustering within the
protein sequence. This method constructs the background model by
assessing coding-silent mutations, which are assumed not to be under
positive selection and thus may reflect the baseline tendency of som-
atic mutations to be clustered. OncodriveCLUST analysis of the
Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer retrieved a list of genes
enriched by the Cancer Gene Census, prioritizing those with dominant
phenotypes but also highlighting some recessive cancer genes, which
showed wider but still delimited mutation clusters. Assessment of
datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrated that
OncodriveCLUST selected cancer genes that were nevertheless
missed by methods based on frequency and functional impact criteria.
This stressed the benefit of combining approaches based on comple-
mentary principles to identify driver mutations. We propose
OncodriveCLUST as an effective tool for that purpose.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the current challenges of oncogenomics is to distinguish
the genomic alterations that are involved in tumourigenesis (i.e.
drivers), from those that give no advantage to cancer cells, but
occur stochastically as a by-product of cancer development, (i.e.
passengers). In line with this distinction, driver genes (i.e. those
bearing driver alterations) confer selective advantage to tumour
development and can be identiﬁed by detecting signals of positive
selection across a cohort of tumours (Dees et al., 2012; Getz
et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Perez and Lopez-Bigas, 2012; Greenman

et al., 2007; Hodis et al., 2012; Reimand and Bader, 2013;
Tamborero et al., 2013). One of the most intuitive
approachesiand the most profusely used at presentito detect
positive selection is based on frequency. Brieﬂy, it consists in
identifying genes more frequently mutated than the background
mutation rate (Dees et al., 2012; Getz et al., 2007). We recently
described a second complementary approach, OncodriveFM
(Gonzalez-Perez and Lopez-Bigas, 2012), to identify genes
under positive selection in tumour development by assessing
their bias towards the accumulation of mutations with high func-
tional impact (FMbias) across a cohort of tumour samples. Here
we propose a third alternative and complementary approach
aimed at detecting genes that bear mutations signiﬁcantly
clustered in specific regions of the amino acid sequence. Gain-
of-function mutations in cancer genes predominantly occur at
speciﬁc protein residues or active domains; for example, most
KRAS mutations are found in residues 12 and 13 of the protein
(Malumbres and Barbacid, 2003), and mutations in PIK3CA are
predominantly found in the kinase and helical domains of the
PIK3CA subunit (Karakas et al., 2006). However, the extent of
this phenomenon in cancer genes and how it can be used to
nominate drivers, not just gain-of-function cancer genes, remains
to be clarified.

The clustering of mutations in the amino acid sequence of
proteinsimutations clustering, for clarityihas already been
suggested as a marker of positive selection (Wagner, 2007),
and some approaches have been described to measure it in
cancer (Stehr et al., 2011; Wagner, 2007; Ye et al., 2010; Yue
et al., 2010). However, the methods described in previous reports
assume that mutation probability is homogeneous across the
gene sequence, which is likely an oversimpliﬁcation that intro-
duces a bias in the detection of meaningful events. To solve this
problem, we have developed OncodriveCLUST, a novel method
that measures the bias of genes towards large mutation clustering
with respect to a background model composed of coding-silent
mutations, which are in principle under no selective pressure and
thus may reﬂect the baseline clustering of somatic mutations. We
have applied OncodriveCLUST to the set of mutations reported
in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)
(Forbes et al., 2010), with the objective of assessing its perform-
ance to select known cancer drivers, i.e. those found in the
Cancer Gene Census (CGC) (Futreal et al., 2004), and to deter-
mine the extent of the mutations clustering phenomenon among
known driver genes, both those described as oncogenes and

tumour suppressors. We have also applied OncodriveCLUST to
several available large datasets of cancer somatic mutations from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) initiative (Consortium et al.,
2008), and compared these results with other methods to identify
driver candidates, namely OncodriveFM (Gonzalez-Perez and
Lopez-Bigas, 2012) and MutSig (Getz et al., 2007). Because all
three approaches measure complementary and independent cri-
teria aimed to discover positive selection (i.e. mutation clustering,
FMbias and mutation frequency), and each of them likely detects
important events, we conclude that the optimal solution is to
combine them to retrieve the most reliable and comprehensive
list of cancer drivers from datasets of somatic mutations of di-
verse tumour types.

2 METHODS

2.1 OncodriveCLUST implementation

The OncodriveCLUST method comprises the following ﬁve steps, illu-
strated in Figure 1: First, single-nucleotide protein-affecting mutations
(i.e. non-synonymous, stop and splice site mutations) are retrieved
(panel 1). Second, positions with a number of mutations above a back-
ground rate threshold (those with a 51% probability of occurrence, ac-
cording to the binomial cumulative distribution function, which takes
into account both the gene length and the overall number of gene muta-
tion) are identiﬁed as potentially meaningful cluster seeds (panel 11).
Third, these positions are grouped to form clusters, joining positions
that fall within distances of ﬁve or less amino-acid residues (panel 111).
Fourth, once these clusters are obtained, they are completed by including
the positions within or adjacent to each cluster that contains mutations in
addition to those considered in the second step (panel IV). Finally, a score
is computed for each cluster. This score is directly proportional to the
percentage of mutations grouped within the cluster and inversely propor-
tional to its length, as shown in the equation,

ctionMutations

. fra
Clustering score =  dmmw
' («5) ‘

where i represents protein positions within the cluster, fractionMutations
is the percentage of mutations falling in that position (out of the total
observed in the protein across samples) and dist is the number of amino
acids spanning between i and the position of the cluster with the largest
number of mutations, i.e. its peak. Note that this score ranges between 0
and 1, where 1 means that a single position concentrates all the mutations
observed in the gene across samples. The rationale behind considering the
fraction of mutations instead of their absolute ﬁgure is to avoid over-
estimating the score of clusters in frequently mutated genes. On the other
hand, inversely weighting the clustering score with the cluster length (see
denominator) tends to favour genes with mutations concentrated in nar-
rower regions (Supplementary Fig. Sl). To complete the ﬁnal step, a gene
clustering score is obtained by summing the scores of all its clusters.
Finally, the signiﬁcance of the observed gene clustering score is estimated
by comparing it with the background model distribution (panel V), ob-
tained by calculating all gene clustering scores of the coding-silent muta-
tions. Because the distribution of the null model is sufﬁciently close to
normal, the signiﬁcance is computed through a Z-score, which is then
transformed into a P value and corrected for multiple testing using the
false discovery rate approach. Therefore, this corrected P value measures
the clustering bias of the protein-affecting mutations of a gene, compared
with that of the coding-silent mutations measured across the dataset.
OncodriveCLUST has been implemented as a Python script (down-
loadable from http://bg.upfedu/oncodriveclust), which requires a ﬁle
stating the position of each mutation within the protein sequence as
input (see the user’s guide for further details). The preparation of this

ﬁle is at the user’s discretion; note that the selection of the protein isoform
may cause, among other factors, different consequence types of the mu-
tations. In the present manuscript, we have processed the mutation data
by using an in-house pipeline that selected the largest isoform. In add-
ition, the launcher allows the use of several optional arguments to cus-
tomize the values used by OncodriveCLUST internal calculations.
Moreover, the user may also choose whether to output the details of
the identiﬁed clusters and the protein domains to further explore the
occurrence of mutations in known functional regions. Finally, the
number of coding-silent mutations of the analysed dataset must ensure
the construction of a background model. For those cases in which this is
not possible owing to a reduced number of samples and/or a low occur-
rence of synonymous mutations, the method can be run with an ‘external’
background model computed from 26 datasets of different large cancer
exome sequencing projects (Supplementary Table SI) that are publicly
available. However, the results of this analysis have to be carefully con-
sidered because it may be subjected to several inaccuracies due to tech-
nical (e.g. differences in mutation calling pipelines) and biological (e.g.
differences in mutation clustering between tumours) considerations.

2.2 Application to the COSMIC dataset

Somatic mutations were downloaded from the COSMIC v.62 dataset
(Forbes et al., 2010) and analysed by OncodriveCLUST including only
those genes with at least 10 single-nucleotide protein-affecting mutations
across all tumour samples in the dataset. Only entries labeled as genome-
wide screen were selected to avoid the inclusion of mutations biased to-
wards more intensively studied positions, which are overrepresented in
COSMIC. In addition, and also to ensure a fair assessment of mutation
clustering, we have also excluded mutations found in metastases, second-
ary and recurrent tumours, as well as mutations not explicitly declared as
somatic, and mutations found in cell lines and xenografts. We obtained
233 775 protein-affecting mutations, whereas the background model was
constructed using 37 338 coding-silent mutations.

2.3 Application to whole exome sequencing TCGA
datasets

We downloaded somatic mutations of four TCGA datasets whose mora-
torium period has expired: breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) (Bell et al.,
2011), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (Hammerman et al., 2012),
ovarian serous carcinoma (OV) (Bell et al., 2011) and uterine corpus
endometrioid carcinoma (UCEC) (Getz et al., 2013). These datasets pos-
sess a large number of silent mutations, thus producing a good back-
ground model; in addition, MutSig results were available for all of them.
They were downloaded from the latest available run in October 2012 at
the Broad Institute Firehose system.

We removed from the OncodriveCLUST analysis samples with abnor-
mally high number of mutations in each dataset, i.e. greater than the
median of the entire distribution as compared with the remaining sam-
ples. These were identiﬁed as outliers of the distribution of mutations per
sample in each dataset. Overall, 12 such outliers appeared in UCEC but
none in the remaining datasets. OncodriveCLUST assessed signiﬁcant
clustering of all genes with protein-affecting mutations in at least three
samples of each cancer dataset. As stated above, the results of
OncodriveCLUST in each TCGA dataset were compared with the
ones of a frequency-based analysis (MutSig) and a functional impact
bias analysis (OncodriveFM). All the analyses aimed to ﬁnd driver
candidates were performed using the same mutation data.
OncodriveFM was run for all genes with protein-affecting mutations in
more than two samples of the OV and BRCA datasets, and in more than
ﬁve samples in UCEC and LUSC. Heatmaps depicted in the present
manuscript were constructed using Gitools (Perez-Llamas and Lopez-
Bigas, 2011). Venn diagrams were created with the BioVenn application
(Hulsen et al., 2008).

OncodriveCLUST to assess the mutation clustering of two dummy
genes. (1) Input data represented by the histogram of protein-affecting
gene mutations, where the x axis is the protein sequence position and the
y axis is the percentage of the gene mutations that occurs in that position.
(11) Meaningful positions are selected as those having a number of muta-
tions that is not expected by chance. This is calculated for each gene
depending on its length and its number of mutations according to the
binomial cumulated distribution function, which is a loose criteria
according to our non-uniform distribution of mutations hypothesis
(probability <1% by default to state a position as meaningful). In the
present panel, the minimum number of mutations calculated for each
gene as the meaningful threshold is represented by a dotted line labelled
as ‘Th’. (III) Meaningful positions found in step (11) are grouped to form
mutation clusters (shadowed in grey in the presented panel). Two con-
secutive positions are grouped within the same cluster if there is a default
maximum distance of 5 amino acids between them. This is considered a
stringent cut-off to deﬁne that two mutations in different residues are
affecting the same tumourigenic mechanism, as stressed by the fact that
most (95%) of the coding-silent mutations, which are assumed to be
stochastically distributed, of the COSMIC dataset are separated by
larger distances. Note that if no meaningful position is found across
the protein sequence, the gene is considered to have no mutation clusters
and therefore no further analysis is performed. In the present example,
gene A has a single meaningful position and thus it forms a single cluster;
in gene B, there are 6 meaningful positions that are grouped forming two
separate clusters. (IV) Mutations that do not occur in the meaningful
positions found in (II) but are either enclosed within the boundaries of
the clusters deﬁned in (111) or adjacent to them are also accounted for the
ﬁnal ﬁgure of the number of mutations enclosed by that cluster. (V)
Thereafter, a score is calculated for each cluster. This score is

3.1 Motivation and hypothesis

Mutation recurrence and the accumulation of functional muta-
tions across samples have both been used to identify genes with
positively selected mutations during tumourigenesis, which are
thus good candidates to play an important role in this process.
On the other hand, the physical grouping of mutations in certain
protein regionsialthough recognized as a signal of positive se-
lectionihas not been exploited as thoroughly for this purpose.
For instance, the MuSiC tool, which is aimed to identify recur-
rently mutated genes, also points at genes with a high density of
mutations, through the so-called proximity analysis (Dees et al.,
2012), but it does not attempt to estimate the signiﬁcance of such
observation. Other approaches developing an analytical frame-
work, base their calculations on the oversimpliﬁed assumption of
a homogeneous background distribution of mutations (see
below) W e et al., 2010). In this study, we present a novel com-
putational method able to identify genes biased towards a sig-
niﬁcant clustering of mutations within regions of the protein
sequence and we assess its ability to nominate cancer drivers.
Our method deﬁnes clusters by grouping together mutations
that are in physical proximity. Also, based on the acknowledg-
ment that mutations do not occur with equal probability on all
positions of a gene, the OncodriveCLUST background model
relies on the degree of clustering of silent mutations observed
across genes in the dataset under analysis.

3.2 Silent mutations do not follow a uniform distribution

Previously described methods to assess the signiﬁcance of muta-
tion clustering assume that the baseline mutation probability is
homogeneous across all gene positions (Stehr et al., 2011;
Wagner, 2007; Ye et al., 2010; Yue et al., 2010), an assumption
that seems oversimpliﬁed according to recent evidences of non-
random mutation processes along the genome (Amos, 2010; Liu
et al., 2013; Martincorena et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2012). As a
first step to overcome this problem, our method measures the
clustering of coding-silent mutations, which are assumed not to
be under selective pressure and may thus reﬂect the baseline
tendency of somatic mutations to preferentially occur at certain
positions of the protein sequence.

We collected COSMIC entries annotated as whole genome
screens and we constructed the background model using the syn-
onymous mutations found in this dataset. In general, coding-

proportional to the number of enclosed mutations and inversely related
to the cluster length (see the ‘Methods’ section for further details about
the clustering score calculation). A ﬁnal value per gene is obtained by
summing the scores of each of the clusters found in that gene (C1 for gene
A and C1 plus C2 for gene B). (VI) Finally, to estimate the signiﬁcance of
each gene score obtained in (V), this is compared with the distribution of
the background model. The background model is obtained by calculating
the clustering scores of all the dataset genes following steps (17V) but
analysing the coding-silent mutations. Note that such comparison allows
to obtain a standard score (i.e. a Z score) after the normal distribution of
the background model has been validated, and a corrected P value is
thereafter derived

silent mutations did not follow a uniform distribution but were
instead noticeably grouped (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore,
protein-affecting mutations that are not clustered beyond this
point may reﬂect spurious ﬁndings, stressing the benefit of
using a non-homogeneous mutations distribution null model to
retrieve more speciﬁc results. Interestingly, some of the clustered
coding-silent mutations may well represent unknown functional
variants positively selected during the tumourigenic process and
deserve further study, which is beyond the scope of the present
manuscript. In any case, we assume that the vast majority of
coding-silent variants are under neutral selection; therefore, we
used their general clustering distribution to construct our back-
ground model.

3.3 Genes with mutation clustering detected by
OncodriveCLUST are enriched for known cancer
genes

Analysis of the COSMIC dataset included 9565 genes that con-
tained at least 10 protein-affecting mutations annotated as whole
genome screen. Of these, 6024 showed at least one cluster of
mutations according to the OncodriveCLUST criteria and were
assessed for signiﬁcance. Overall, 123 genes were biased towards
a larger mutation clustering as compared with the aforemen-
tioned background model (corrected P value <5%). The
output of this analysis is provided in Supplementary File S1.
Genes selected by OncodriveCLUST were enriched for known
cancer drivers included in the CGC (27/ 122:22% versus 232/
9444:2.4%). Most of these (19/27:70%) possessed a

Nevertheless, we also detected signiﬁcant clusters among reces-
sive cancer genes, which were wider, as a rule. These results sup-
port the hypothesis that clustering is more pronounced among
genes that experience gain-of-function, although mutations lead-
ing to loss-of—function in some genes also occur predominantly
within certain regions of the protein (Fig. 2).

Next, we used OncodriveCLUST to analyse the four selected
TGCA datasets. In all of them, the genes nominated by
OncodriveCLUST were enriched for known cancer drivers
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The detailed output of these analyses
is provided in Supplementary Files S27S5. The observation that
known cancer genes were consistently selected by
OncodriveCLUST as bearing signiﬁcant mutations clusters dem-
onstrate that this method is also useful to nominate novel drivers.

3.4 Using OncodriveCLUST to complement results of
other methods to identify drivers

There are crucial cancer genes that cannot be identiﬁed by the
mutation clustering approach, such as tumour suppressors whose
loss-of—function mutations are evenly distributed across the se-
quence. Moreover, the ability to measure the mutations cluster-
ing depends on the number of observed mutations. Therefore,
this approach in general is not suitable to detect lowly recurrent
drivers. As a consequence, the analysis of somatic mutations in a
tumour cohort with OncodriveCLUST may provide a list of re-
liable but incomplete candidate drivers. The retrieval of a more
comprehensive driver list requires the combination of several

whole gene screen. Panel B depicts the mutation histograms of two well-known cancer drivers, namely KRAS and TP53. The former illustrates the ideal
expected behavior of an oncogene, where mutations occur in speciﬁc regions that cause the selected gain-of-function, and this gene obtained the largest
cluster bias from the COSMIC dataset. On the other hand, TP53 loss-of-function is the result of mutations that occur in wider regions of the protein
sequence; although they are less clustered, mutations in this gene still show a high degree of spatial afﬁnity (corrected OncodriveCLUST P value of 0.03)

methods that use complementary criteria to identify genes bear-
ing signals of positive selection. We anticipate that the analysis of
mutations clustering may combine well with OncodriveFM, a
method based on the accumulation of mutations with high func-
tional impact within genes as a marker of positive selection.
Because there are other methods aimed to identify driver muta-
tions, we also compared the Oncodrive results with those ob-
tained by a current well-established approach, MutSig, which
is based on analysing whether a gene is mutated more often
than expected by chance across a cohort of tumour samples.
As a result of this comparison, we found some genes identiﬁed
by OncodriveCLUST that were missed by the other methods.
Some of these are found in the CGC, and are thus likely drivers
identiﬁed by clustering criteria but not by functional impact or
recurrence analysis; interestingly, most of them (9 out of 11)
exhibit a dominant phenotype (Fig. 3). In addition to genes
included in the CGC, OncodriveCLUST is also able to highlight
novel driver candidates that are overlooked by other methods.
For instance, among the 55 genes with signiﬁcant mutation clus-
ters in the BRCA dataset, 38 were not identiﬁed by other meth-
odsias PLA2G3 (involved in cell growth and death), MMP14
(matrix metalloproteinase), REVl (involved in DNA repair) and
the caspase CASPS. These may be regarded as potential candi-
dates to drive the emergence of the tumour phenotype that were

4 DISCUSSION

The elucidation of cancer drivers relies on identifying the marks
of positive selection that occur during the clonal evolution of
tumours. The trend shown by protein-affecting mutations to ac-
cumulate predominantly in certain gene regions is a fingerprint
that may denote events targeted by the tumourigenesis.
However, it is now apparent that the probability of occurrence
of somatic mutations is affected by several factors and varies
across the genomic sequence (Amos, 2010; Liu et al., 2013;
Martincorena et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2012). This should be
taken into account when identifying mutation clusters because
the assumption of a uniform mutation distribution as the null
model may overestimate the signiﬁcance of observed clusters.
However, the factors determining the occurrence of mutational
hotspots are not fully understood, and their inference is not
straightforward by mining the data under analysis to obtain a
background model per gene and sample. Instead, we propose to
construct the background model using the degree of clustering of
synonymous mutations, which are assumed not to be under posi-
tive selection and may thus reﬂect the baseline mutation

Fig. 3. Selected top-ranking genes from the OncodriveCLUST analysis on four TCGA datasets. Summary of the results obtained by three methods
aimed to ﬁnd driver genes for the four analysed datasets retrieved from TCGA project: OncodriveFM (functional impact criteria), OncodriveCLUST
(mutation clustering criteria) and MutSig (mutation frequency criteria). Only genes annotated in the CGC are depicted. Combination of approaches
based on different theoretical principles confers different levels of evidence. Note that OncodriveCLUST selected genes likely to be involved in the
disease, several of them missed by the other methods. The label ‘Not assessable’ denotes genes whose functional impact metrics cannot be calculated

(OncodriveFM), or genes with no mutation cluster (OncodriveCLUST)

clustering of the tumour. This assumption also probably com-
prises a simpliﬁcation because some coding-silent mutations
could in principle alter processes such as chromatin remodeling
or mRNA processing. Nevertheless, apart from this, they are not
in general functionally involved in tumourigenesis. Moreover,
and owing to the low-recurrence of synonymous mutations, the
background model cannot establish constraints for particular
genomic regions. Therefore, the method presents several caveats,
which have to be taken into account. However, although limited,
this null model shall in principle speciﬁcally support the identi-
ﬁcation of genes whose mutations are grouped above the back-
ground. As a matter of fact, this approach was proven successful
in prioritizing genes involved in the disease because
OncodriveCLUST retrieved a reduced list of genes enriched for
cancer drivers in all the datasets analysed. In general, the clus-
tering analysis better detected drivers known to exhibit a dom-
inant phenotype because mutations in these genes occur at
particular sites that lead to the favoured gain-of-function.
However, recessive genes were also highlighted over the back-
ground model because their mutations occur in larger but still
delimited regions leading to loss-of—function.

The identiﬁcation of drivers can proﬁt from the combination of
methods based on different theoretical principles, in particular if
they use complementary criteria. In this regard, Oncodrive-
CLUST complements OncodriveFM because it better captures
the behaviour of gain-of—function cancer genes, whereas Oncodri-
veFM is better at identifying tumour suppressor genes, which
bear loss-of-function mutations that usually receive higher func-
tional impact scores. By comparison, mutations conferring gain-
of—function are more prone to produce lower scores of functional
impact. For instance, mutations that change residue 1047 of
PIK3CA are known to be oncogenic but are underestimated by
functional impact metrics because they rely largely on conserva-
tion criteria and this particular residue is highly variable across
species. Therefore, OncodriveFM overlooks this gene in the
BRCA dataset because most PIK3CA mutations occur in that
speciﬁc position. Nevertheless, this scenario in which gene muta-
tions predominantly occur at certain protein positions is well
highlighted by the OncodriveCLUST analysis, illustrating how
the bias of a method is captured by using complementary criteria.

At present, the most widely used approach to identify driver
genes consists in detecting those that are mutated more frequently
than expected by chance. Therefore, we compared the
OncodriveCLUST results obtained in the TGCA datasets with
those obtained by MutSig (Getz et al., 2007), a well-established
method to detect signiﬁcantly mutated genes across cohorts of
tumour samples. To avoid further interpretation, we limited the
comparison with already well described drivers, i.e. genes con-
tained in the CGC. As a result, we demonstrated that
OncodriveCLUST selected several cancer drivers that were
missed not only by OncodriveFM but also by the recurrence
analysis. Of note, this suggests that OncodriveCLUST could
identify novel driver candidates (i.e. not included in the CGC)
that are nevertheless overlooked by other methods and empha-
sizes the beneﬁt of using a combination of methods to elucidate
driver genes that balances the strengths and weaknesses of each
approach. This would allow the retrieval of a more comprehen-
sive list of putative drivers because each may exhibit different
signals of positive selection. In addition, it could also help to

estimate the reliability of the results because the false positives
of a method are unlikely to be picked up by another one based on
complementary criteria and therefore with its own sources of bias.

One important advantage of OncodriveCLUST, and of
OncodriveFM as well, is that the required input consists only
on the list of tumour somatic mutations in the cohort. Raw data,
such as BAM ﬁles are not required, which reduces the burden of
download, storage and computational processing. This is a
major issue because the amount of data generated by tumour
genome re-sequencing studies continues to increase and the tech-
nical requirements of some methods could limit the analysis of
large datasets. This is specially true for initiatives aimed at inte-
grating data from different projects [e. g. IntOGen (Gundem
et al., 2010)].

In summary, the elucidation of genes involved in cancer is a chal-
lenging task that requires the combined use of approaches based
on different criteria. In this regard, we show that Oncodrive
CLUST complements well other existing methods and should be
taken into account for the identiﬁcation of cancer drivers.

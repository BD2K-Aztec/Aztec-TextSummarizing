PTID

 

To derive potential pesticidesiproteins relationships, which
were hidden in a vast amount of dispersed literature, text
mining method were introduced. Starting with 1347 pesticides
and their synonyms, the text mining tool PolySearch was used
for extracting the relevant text passages containing potential
pesticide—target relationships from public abstracts listed in
PubMed (Cheng et al., 2008). More than 13 000 interactions of
pesticide—target were extracted, and 4245 protein terms were
ﬁnally mapped onto the pesticides and classiﬁed accordingly.
We assigned relevancy score as confidence score to reﬂect the
level of signiﬁcance and certainty of interactions. Details of rele—
vancy score could refer to the Supplementary Material. In add—
ition to literature—derived protein terms, sequence date and other
annotation were searched from Entrez Gene and SwissProt/
TrEMBL by querying the combination of protein terms and
organism of pests.

3 USER INTERFACE AND SERVICE

3.1 Web interface

The data of PTID is accessible through a simple, user—friendly
web interface. In addition to intelligent text search and advanced
Boolean text search, PTID also offers a sequence alignment
search and a chemical structure search.

The structure similarity search tool allows users to quickly
and simply identify pesticide scaffolds by inputting query tem—
plate. PTID provides three methods for similarity searching.
Fingerprints molecular similarity and substructure searching
implemented by Open Babel allow a quick identification of pesti—
cide scaffolds by inputting query template, whereas 3D similarity
method implemented by SHAFTS, which combines shape similar—
ity and feature similarity and allows an identiﬁcation of pesticides
with similar physiochemical properties, may affect the same mode
of action (Liu et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; O’Boyle et al., 2011).

Similarly, sequence alignment is particularly useful, as it can
potentially allow users to quickly and simply identify pesticides
from newly sequenced pathogens. Given the FASTA formatted
sequence and chosen target organism, the sequence alignment
search service performs a BLAST search on PTID target
dictionary.

3.2 Local BLAST service

Sequence alignment is crucial for many biological analyses,
including functional annotation, classifying protein and structure
modeling. PTID provides local BLAST service in the detailed page
of each sequence. Sequence index of non—redundant protein se—
quence, PDB and SwissProt were provided. The BLAST service
allows users to specify database, sequence segment and other
parameters. The output page, which is formatted by BLAST,
includes a link to corresponding record of these protein databases.

3.3 ChemMapper service

Through the integration of ChemMapper, PTID provided the
functions for novel pesticides discovery and potential mode of
action prediction via polypharmacology effects computation
(http://lilab.ecust.edu.cn/chemmapper/). ChemMapper service
can be used to generate novel chemical scaffolds and lead

discovery by the pattern of known agrochemicals in PTID
through three—dimensional molecular similarity search in the
large scale of chemical library. On the other hand, searching in
a large repertoire of bioactive chemical database with target an—
notation can help users to retrieve new biological effects or elu—
cidate their mechanism of action via predicting potential targets
for those agrochemicals; moreover, potential toxicity can also be
predicted by comparing with similar chemicals, which bind to
anti—targets of Homo sapiens or mammalia. (See more details
from Supplementary Material)

3.4 Pesticides-targets network visualization

Graphic network always provides intuitively view of interaction
data. PTID presented current entry in context of an interactive
graphic network implemented by customized Cytoscape web net—
work visualization components of interaction partners (Lopes
et al., 2010). The customized Cytoscape web plugin has a user—
friendly graphical user interface and supplies various tools and
layouts for network analysis. Users may filter nodes or edges
according to confidence score or distance between other nodes
and current entry. Using network analysis, it can be hypothesized
that certain pesticides, which have high degrees, could show
their toxicity and adverse environmental effect (Supplementary
Figure S1).

4 CONCLUSION

The current version of PTID contains ~1347 pesticides with an—
notation of toxicity and environmental fates. More than 4245
potential target terms were derived by text mining tool; sequence
data were also annotated for each target term. In addition to
these data, several computational tools for target exploration
and virtual screen were also integrated into PTID. Potential ap—
plication of PTID includes identiﬁcation of pesticides by struc—
tures or properties interest; prediction of potential targets; or
assessment of toxicity and environmental effect. To our know—
ledge, PTID is the ﬁrst attempt to establish a pesticide database,
which is integrated with the knowledge of proteiniprotein inter—
actions. It is expected that PTID will serve as a useful resource
for the development of agrochemicals.

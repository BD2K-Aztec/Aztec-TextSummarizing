ABSTRACT

Motivation: Satellite DNA makes up significant portion of many
eukaryotic genomes, yet it is relatively poorly characterized
even in extensively sequenced species. This is, in part, due to
methodological limitations of traditional methods of satellite repeat
analysis, which are based on multiple alignments of monomer
sequences. Therefore, we employed an alternative, alignment-
free, approach utilizing k-mer frequency statistics, which is in
principle more suitable for analyzing large sets of satellite repeat
data, including sequence reads from next generation sequencing
technologies.

Results: k-mer frequency spectra were determined for two sets
of rice centromeric satellite CentO sequences, including 454 reads
from ChlP-sequencing of CENH3-bound DNA (7.6 Mb) and the
whole genome Sanger sequencing reads (5.8 Mb). k-mer frequencies
were used to identify the most conserved sequence regions
and to reconstruct consensus sequences of complete monomers.
Reconstructed consensus sequences as well as the assessment of
overall divergence of k-mer spectra revealed high similarity of the
two datasets, suggesting that CentO sequences associated with
functional centromeres (CENH3-bound) do not significantly differ
from the total population of CentO, which includes both centromeric
and pericentromeric repeat arrays. On the other hand, considerable
differences were revealed when these methods were used for
comparison of CentO populations between individual chromosomes
of the rice genome assembly, demonstrating preferential sequence
homogenization of the clusters within the same chromosome. k-mer
frequencies were also successfully used to identify and characterize
stNAs derived from CentO repeats.

1 INTRODUCTION

Highly abundant, tandemly arranged DNA repeats, referred to
as satellite DNA, are among the major constituents of complex

eukaryotic genomes. They are composed of basic repeated units, or
monomers, which are usually only tens to hundreds of nucleotides
long (Macas et (11., 2002). However, they can be ampliﬁed to
millions of copies, making up to 20% of plant nuclear DNA (Ingham
et (11., 1993) and even higher proportions in some insect or rodent
genomes (Hacch and Mazrimas, 1974; Pons et al., 1997). Up to
megabase-sized arrays of head-to-tail arranged monomers constitute
speciﬁc genomic regions appearing as heterochromatic bands or
spots on mitotic chromosomes or interphase nuclei. Satellite repeats
are among the most dynamic components of eukaryotic genomes,
undergoing rapid changes in their sequences and abundance, which
often result in emergence of genus-speciﬁc or even species-speciﬁc
repeats (Macas et (11., 2000; Tek et (11., 2005). In contrast to this
rapid inter-speciﬁc diversiﬁcation, monomers of a given satellite
are usually highly homogenized within a species as a result of
their concerted evolution (Elder and Turner, 1995). This uniformity,
together with the genomic organization of satellite repeats into long
contiguous arrays represent serious obstacles to their investigation
using conventional cloning and sequencing approaches (Lee et (11.,
2006; Song et (11., 2001). Consequently, large proportions of satellite
sequences are left out from genome assemblies even in extensively
studied model species. As the number of genomes investigated using
large-scale sequencing increases, there is a mounting amount of
unexplored satellite sequence data available in the repositories of
unassembled reads. This increase has recently been accelerated by
the development of next generation sequencing technologies, which
have made whole genome shotgun sequencing possible in a wide
range of species. All these sequencing projects generate a wealth of
data, which, if properly analyzed, could be used to investigate the
patterns of intra- and inter-speciﬁc evolution of satellite repeats.
Sequence analysis of satellite DNA is traditionally based on
a deﬁnition of basic repeated units (monomers or higher order
repeats), which are subjected to pairwise or multiple sequence
alignments to assess their similarities. While this approach is
intuitive and in many respects convenient, it also includes several
drawbacks: (i) it is prone to bias introduced by subjective decisions
when deﬁning individual repeat units within a longer sequence,
especially in the case of less conserved repeats; (ii) processing
large amounts of sequence data in this way is laborious; and (iii)
multiple sequence alignments are feasible only with up to hundreds
of monomers, as computational and visualization constraints are

becoming limiting concomitant with the increasing number of
analyzed sequences. These problems hinder efﬁcient utilization
of sequence data from large-scale sequencing of model genomes
based on Sanger sequencing and become even more obvious when
handling the sequence data generated by the next generation,
high-throughput sequencing technologies including Roche/454 Life
Sciences, Solexa/Illumina, ABI/SOLiD and Helicos systems. High-
throughput sequencing is based on cloning-free, massively parallel
processing of millions of individual templates, generating up to
gigabases of sequence data in a single run (Shendure and Ji,
2008). The absence of the cloning step and production of large
quantities of sequence reads make these techniques ideal for
in-depth studies of satellite repeats in complex genomes. Indeed,
it has been demonstrated that 454 sequencing facilitates highly
efﬁcient identiﬁcation of novel families of satellite DNA in plants
(Macas et (11., 2007). However, massively parallel sequencing
data cannot be utilized for satellite sequence analysis using the
traditional, monomer-based approaches, as the short length of the
sequence reads hampers extraction of the ﬁill-length monomer
sequences and the extremely large volume of the produced
sequencing data prevents its analysis based on multiple sequence
alignments.

Here, we explore an alternative way to globally characterize
satellite repeats based on alignment-free sequence analysis using
k-mer frequency statistics (Vinga and Almeida, 2003). The analysis
starts with the decomposition of each sequence into a set of
overlapping k-mers (oligomers of ﬁxed length k, also called L-tuples
or words) and determination of a spectrum of k-mer frequencies
for the whole collection of sequences. This information is then
used to identify the most conserved sequence fragments within
the analyzed set, to infer the prevailing monomer length and to
reconstruct its sequence. It is also employed to assess global
similarities between various sequence sets. As the analysis is
centered on short (10—17 nt) k-mers, it can be applied to analyzing
and comparing sets of sequence fragments of various lengths,
ranging from long Sanger reads down to the short sequences
(~35 nt) generated by some of the next generation sequencing
technologies.

In this work, we used the approach outlined above for global
sequence characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) satellite
repeat CentO, which is one of the major components of the
centromeric regions of this species’ chromosomes. The prevalent
monomer size of CentO repeats is 155 bp and the satellite
was estimated to make up ~1.6% of the rice genome (Cheng
et (11., 2002). The analysis was performed on several datasets
acquired by different large-scale sequencing approaches. Data from
the 454 sequencing of DNA fragments obtained by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) with the centromeric histone
CENH3 antibody (Yan et (11., 2008) were used to investigate
the repeats associated with functional centromeres. The other
analyzed datasets included CentO repeats extracted from whole
genome shotgun Sanger sequencing reads and from CentO arrays
on individual chromosomes of the rice genome assembly. We
also demonstrated how k-mer spectra can be used for the
identiﬁcation of small RNAs (stNAs) derived from CentO
sequences, because this class of transcripts originating from
centromeric repeats is supposed to play an important role in
centromere formation and ﬁinction (Alshire and Karpen, 2008;
Carone et (11., 2009). This analyzes provided, for the ﬁrst time, a

global sequence characterization of various genomic populations of
CentO repeats.

2 METHODS

All sequencing data used in this study were from japonica rice (Osativa
ssp. japonica var. Nipponbare). The 454 reads of rice sequences associated
with centromeric histone H3 were generated previously using chromatin
immunoprecipitation with CENH3 antibody followed by 454 sequencing
using GS-20 instrument (Yan et (11., 2008). Whole genome shotgun Sanger
sequencing reads (Goff at (11., 2002) were retrieved from the NCBI Trace
Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/) using a query selecting for
‘shotgun’ trace type and ‘SBI’ (Syngenta) sequencing center. It should
be noted that contrary to the 454 sequences these reads were obtained
by sequencing cloned fragments. Although in the case of CentO repeats
we did not observe any discrepancies, caution should be taken in other
studies when comparing these types of sequencing data as the cloning step
may introduce some distortions in sequence representation. The assembled
genome pseudomolecules (version 5) corresponding to individual rice
chromosomes were downloaded from the Rice Genome Annotation project
(http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/pseudomolecules/). Centromeric regions of
the assembled pseudomolecules were screened using the dot-plot analysis
program Gepard (Krumsiek at (11., 2007) to identify blocks of CentO
repeats. These blocks were retrieved and kept separate for further analysis
(see Supplementary Material 81 for coordinates of CentO blocks within
assembled chromosomes). In addition, all identiﬁed CentO sequences
(898 684 bp) were put in the same orientation and used to build a BLAST
(Altschul at (11., 1997) database representing the genomic diversity of CentO.
This database was then employed for similarity-based identiﬁcation of CentO
sequences within the sets of CENH3-ChIPed 454 and genomic shotgun reads.
The reads were compared to the database using the blastn program (e-Value
cutoff 0.01, low-complexity ﬁltering off) and the reads were considered to
contain CentO when producing hits with bit score of at least 60. This bit
score provided a relatively relaxed cutoff, corresponding for example to an
89% identity over a 54 bp region, which should ensure efﬁcient capturing of
all variants of CentO sequences.

The sequence analyzes were performed using custom-made BioPerl
(http://www.bioperl.org) and R (R Development Core Team, 2009;
http://www.R-project.org) scripts executed on a dual-processor server with
16GB RAM running under the Debian Linux operating system (the scripts
are available from the corresponding author). k-mer frequencies in the
analyzed sequence sets were calculated by moving a sliding window of
the length k in one nucleotide steps over each sequence within the set,
extracting corresponding k-mer sequences and storing their counts in a
hash table. The frequencies were then calculated by dividing the counts
by a total number of extracted k-mers, and F100 values were obtained by
multiplying the frequencies by 15 500. This value corresponds to the length
of 100 CentO monomers, considering that the monomer length with the
greatest frequency in rice genome is 155 bp (Lee at (11., 2006; Ma and
Jackson, 2006). Quantiﬁcation of differences in k-mer frequencies between
two datasets were performed by calculating their Euclidean distance (Vinga
and Almeida, 2003).

Reconstruction of the most conserved CentO regions was performed
using a list of 17-mers sorted according to their frequencies, starting with
the most frequent k-mer and using a threshold of 10% of the starting
k-mer frequency for its extension (see also Fig. 4). The k-mers already
used in the reconstruction were removed from the list and the next most
frequent k-mer was used as a seed for a new fragment reconstruction,
until no k-mers with F10032 were available. Sequence logos (Schneider
and Stephens, 1990) of the reconstructed fragments were generated using
frequency matrices where each position was assigned a value of the most
frequent k-mer overlapping this position. To build a consensus logo, the
reconstructed fragments were aligned using SeaView (Galtier at (11., 1996)
and their frequency matrices were merged according to their positions on

the alignment (Supplementary Material S2). Reconstruction of chromosome-
speciﬁc CentO fragments was performed based on differences between k-mer
frequencies calculated for CentO sequences from a single chromosome
versus all the remaining chromosomes pooled together.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Preparing the datasets of CentO sequences

Genomic sequences located within rice centromeres were isolated
based on their association with the centromere-speciﬁc histone
variant CENH3 (Yan et (11., 2008). DNA fragments recovered from
the ChIP assay employing CENH3-speciﬁc antibody were subjected
to 454 sequencing, which yielded 325 298 reads with an average
length of 106 nt. Using a sequence similarity search against a
comprehensive compilation of known CentO sequences revealed
that 115 036 (35.4%) of these reads were derived from CentO
repeats. Compared to the estimated proportion of CentO in the rice
genome (1.6%, Cheng et (11., 2002), the immunoprecipitated sample
was enriched for CentO by about 22-fold, thus demonstrating the
efﬁciency of the assay.

As the 454 reads ranged from 46 to 253 nt, they were trimmed
to the same length prior to analysis in order to ensure equal
contribution of each read to the global sequence statistics. This
precaution should avoid a bias towards certain sequences because
the read length produced during a given number of 454 sequencing
cycles depends on template complexity (Rahmann, 2006). Thus,
only the ﬁrst 90 nucleotides were used from reads of this or longer
length. Using this cutoff still allowed use of 95.4% of the reads,
while the remaining 4.6% of the reads, which were shorter than
90 nt, were discarded. In addition, low-quality (2.6%) and duplicated
reads representing sequencing artifacts (19.5%) were also removed,
resulting in a ﬁnal set of 84 271 trimmed reads, corresponding to a
total of 7 584 390 nucleotides that were used for further analysis.

In addition to the CentO sequences obtained by CENH3-
immunoprecipitation (further referred to as the ‘ChIP’ sample),
we also investigated CentO repeats identiﬁed in the collection
of unassembled whole genome shotgun reads produced by
conventional (Sanger) sequencing in frame of the rice sequencing
project (Goff et (11., 2002). These sequences (further referred to as the
‘WGS’ sample) were used for comparison with the ChIPed sample as
they should represent a total genomic pool of CentO sequences (both
centromeric and peri-centromeric), contrary to the ChIP sample,
which should mostly include centromere-associated repeats. To get a
dataset comparable to the ChIP data, WGS sequences were prepared
for analysis by randomly extracting a single 90 bp segment from each
shotgun read and selecting the fragments containing CentO repeats
using the same procedure as for the ChIP sample. Out of 5 438 615
shotgun read segments there were 65150 (1.2%) sequences that
passed the selection criteria, providing 5 836 500 nt of sequence data.

3.2 Calculating and comparing k-mer spectra

As the ﬁrst step in sequence analysis, the k-mer composition
of each read was determined, providing a list of all k-mers
occurring in the analyzed dataset (k-mer spectrum of the dataset).
Summary counts of k-mers were calculated for the whole dataset
and abundance of individual k-mer sequences was expressed as their
frequency in the analyzed sequences (number of occurrences/total
number of counted k-mers). These calculations were performed

for k-mers with k=10,13,15 and 17. The observed frequencies
spanned over four orders of magnitude for each k in both ChIP
and WGS datasets. Unique k-mer frequencies were quite low, on
the order of 10‘7. Therefore, we expressed the k-mer abundance
as their frequency multiplied by 15 500 to obtain values providing
more comprehensible information about k-mer conservation within
CentO repeated units. The value 15 500 corresponds to 100 CentO
monomers of length 155 bp, which is their predominant size in the
rice genome (Lee et (11., 2006; Ma and Jackson, 2006). Thus, this
value, further referred to as F100, could be used as an approximate
indicator of the proportion of CentO monomers in which the k-mer
occurs. For example, the frequency of the most abundant ChIP
10-mer ‘ATGTCCAAAA’ was 0.0051, which corresponds to a F100
of 79.2 and indicates that this sequence is present in ~79% of
CentO monomers. In spite of the large number of different k-mer
sequences encountered within CentO reads, there was only a small
fraction of the most frequent k-mers, which accounted for majority of
CentO sequences. For instance, 5.7% and 4.8% of the most frequent
10-mers represented 90% of all CentO sequences in the ChIP and
WGS samples, respectively (Fig. 1).

A graphical comparison of k-mer frequencies between ChIP and
WGS revealed high similarity between these two sets, especially
with regards to the most conserved k-mers (Fig. 2). Frequencies of
most k-mers with F100 > 10 differed less than 2-fold between the
sets, and frequency values differing more than 3-fold were found
only for less frequent k-mers (F 100 < 1). The exception was a subset
of k-mers that were about 10-fold more frequent in ChIP than in
WGS (F100 of 1.0—10 in ChIP versus 0.1—1.0 in WGS, Fig. 2).
However, as these k-mers mostly included homopolymer sequences
(usually tracts of at least four ‘T’s or ‘A’s), the likely explanation for
this observation is that their increased frequency in the ChIP fraction
was a consequence of sequencing errors known to be generated
by 454 sequencing of the homopolymer templates (Huse et (11.,
2007).

observed in the two sets (black, <2—fold; blue, 2-3-fold; red, >3-fold difference).

A global measure of dissimilarity between two sequence sets
can be obtained by evaluating the differences between frequencies
at which individual k-mers occur in the two sets. Based on
this principle, we compared ChIP and WGS sets by calculating
their Euclidean distance ((113). We also extended our comparison
to the set of CentO repeats extracted from version 5 of the
japonica genome assembly (marked as ‘JAT’) and then to the sub-
populations present on different chromosomes (pseudomolecules)
of the assembly. These sub-populations were represented by
individual clusters (contiguous arrays of CentO repeats separated
by other sequences) identiﬁed in the (pen-)centromeric regions
of the assembled chromosomes. The Euclidean distance values
shown in Figure 3 are based on 15-mer frequencies; however,
we obtained principally identical results when employing other
k-mer lengths. This analysis conﬁrmed the similarity of ChIP
and WGS sets (dE=104), suggesting there are no signiﬁcant
differences between centromere-associated and the whole genome
population of CentO sequences. Comparison of the ChIP and
WGS sets to the sequences extracted from the genome assembly
(JAT) resulted in slightly higher values (dE=144 and 126,
respectively), most likely reﬂecting the fact that the genome
assembly does not completely cover centromeric regions of most
chromosomes, and thus a substantial part of CentO repeats is
missing from the assembly. However, much higher dissimilarities
were observed between CentO sets from individual chromosomes,
which differed to various extents. For example, the highest
(11; values were obtained when comparing chromosomes 6, 3
and 8 to others but not in their mutual comparisons, revealing
that these three chromosomes share similar CentO sequences
(Fig. 3). As CentO repeats in most centromeres are arranged
into several clusters made up of contiguous arrays of the
repeat monomers separated by non-CentO sequences, we also
performed the comparison on this level in order to get more
detailed information about CentO variability. This analysis revealed
that the degree of dissimilarity is generally considerably lower
between clusters from the same chromosome than between different
chromosomes, suggesting intra—chromosomal homogenization of
CentO repeats. This was especially obvious for chromosomes 6, 7
and 9.

Fig. 4. Principle of sequence reconstruction. (A) The procedure starts with
the most frequent k-mer (F 100265.58), which is repeatedly extended to
both directions by ﬁnding the most frequent overlapping k-mers until their
frequency drops below the speciﬁed threshold (set to 70% of the starting k-
mer frequency in this example). (B) Sequence logo (Schneider and Stephens,
1990) is then constructed where height of the letters corresponds to k-mer
frequencies.

to reconstruct longer sequence regions corresponding to the most
conserved variants of the analyzed sequences. The principle of
the reconstruction procedure is depicted in Figure 4. It employs
a greedy algorithm starting with the most frequent k-mer, which
is extended into both directions by repeatedly searching for one
base extensions by ﬁnding k-mers overlapping with k-1 nucleotides.
Only the k-mer with the highest frequency is used to determine
the one base extension, and it is then, in turn, used as a query in
the next round of extension until a speciﬁed threshold is reached.
Figure 5A shows an example of reconstructed fragments from ChIP
k-mers corresponding to the ﬁrst 55 nt of the CentO monomer.
These fragments represent the most abundant variants of the CentO
repeats, which can be merged together to produce a sequence logo
(Schneider and Stephens, 1990), giving an overview of the degree
of conservation and composition of the major sequence variants
(Fig. 5B and Supplementary Material S2). Although the prevailing
CentO monomer size is 155 bp, the total length of the reconstructed
monomer was 165 bp due to the occurrence of the longer CentO
subfamily characterized by a 10 bp insertion. This insertion is located
in positions 140—149 of the consensus, and the small height of the
sequence logo at this region reﬂects the smaller abundance of this
sequence variant in the genome. Performing the same reconstruction
procedure for WGS k-mers and comparison of the reconstructed
logo to the ChIP one conﬁrmed the low divergence of these two
samples as the two reconstructed sequences were almost identical,
considering the prevalent bases at each position. However, there
were minor differences in both the degree of conservation of various
sequence regions and the presence of additional bases at certain
positions (Fig. 5B).

The principle of sequence reconstruction depicted in Figure 4
can also be employed for identiﬁcation of sequence variants
enriched in one sample relative to the other, using differences
between k-mer frequencies in the compared sets as the input
for the reconstruction. In this case, the k-mers are assigned

values calculated by subtraction of their observed frequencies
in the two sets, and the reconstruction starts with those having
the highest positive or negative values, depending on their
enrichment in the ﬁrst or the second set. This method was used
for reconstruction of CentO fragments with unequal distribution
among individual chromosomes, using data from the assembled rice
chromosome pseudomolecules. Chromosome-speciﬁc fragments
were identiﬁed for all chromosomes tested (Table 1), along with
a number of other sequences that showed preferential localization
to a subset of chromosomes (not shown). These data conﬁrmed
partial sequence diversiﬁcation of CentO populations present on
different chromosomes, supporting the hypothesis that CentO
homogenization occurs primarily on intra-chromosomal scale.

3.4 Utilization of k-mer spectra for identiﬁcation of

each k-mer can then be used to determine whether the similarity
hit corresponds to the sequence motif conserved in the query set.
Using these principles, we searched for CentO-derived transcripts
in the collection of 296201 rice stNA sequences published
by Nobuta et (11. (2007). This dataset is composed of 17-nt tags
obtained by end-sequencing of stNAs extracted from various
tissues, and also includes information about the abundance of each
sequence in the studied tissues. The stNAs derived from CentO
repeats were detected by their identity to the 17-mers present in
the WGS set representing all genomic CentO sequences. There
was a total of 213 CentO stNAs identiﬁed (0.07% of the whole
stNA set), mostly corresponding to relatively rare transcripts
with frequency of only 1—95 TPQ (Trancsripts Per Quarter million;
Nobuta et (11., 2007). The abundance of individual stNA sequences
was not proportional to the frequency of corresponding k-mers in
the genomic CentO sequences, suggesting that their precursors were
not transcribed from the most conserved CentO repeats (Fig. 6A).
Comparison of data from stNA libraries constructed from six
different tissues revealed considerable differences in both CentO
stNA diversity and abundance. Of 213 sequences, 194 (91%)
were speciﬁc for a single library and there was none occurring in
all libraries. The largest group was identiﬁed in immature panicles
comprising 54 distinct stNA sequences, while the smallest set
was uncovered in ABA-treated seedlings containing 25 CentO
stNAs. The total abundance of all CentO stNAs found in a
single library ranged between 118 and 341 TPQ, being lowest in
germinating seedlings and highest in immature panicles. Mapping
CentO stNA sequences (regardless of the library of origin) to
the japonica rice assembly revealed their dispersed distribution
along CentO clusters, having average density of 84 stNA sites
per lkb, which corresponds to about 13 sites per monomer. There
was no CentO monomer found completely covered with stNAs,
as the longest stretch of CentO continuously overlaid by stNA
sequences was 138-bp long, potentially giving rise to 34 distinct
stNAs (data not shown). Interestingly, of 213 CentO stNA
sequences identiﬁed in this study, 137 (64%) originated from the
bottom strand, while only 76 (36%) from the top strand (relative to
the sequence orientation shown on Fig. 5B). The prevalence of the
small RNAs originated from the bottom strand was most evident in
immature panicles comprising ﬁve times more stNA sequences

Characterization of rice centromeric satellite based on oligomer frequency statistics

 

derived from the bottom CentO strand than from the top strand,
totally accounting for 11-fold higher proportion of CentO stNA
transcripts. In other libraries, however, this trend was less apparent
or even reversed as in the case of ABA-treated seedlings (Fig. 6B).

4 DISCUSSION

Although the algorithms utilizing k-mer statistics has long been
employed in some widely used programs including BLAST
(Altschul et a1., 1997), they have recently drawn more attention
due to their suitability for analyzing large amounts of sequence
data. For example, k-mer frequencies derived from whole-genome
Sanger and Solexa/Illumina reads provided an efﬁcient means for
the identiﬁcation of repetitive sequences in genomic clones of maize
and barley (Kurtz et a1., 2008; Wicker et a1., 2008), and evaluation of
differences in k-mer composition was found superior to alignment-
based methods in phylogenetic tree reconstruction including large
datasets (Yang and Zhang, 2008). In this study, we demonstrated that
k-mer frequency statistics can also be successﬁilly adapted to the
characterization and comparative analysis of large sets of satellite
sequences. Our approach does not require a priori knowledge of
repeat monomer length and is independent of the size of sequencing
reads, provided it is equal or larger than the size of analyzed
k-mers. It has been demonstrated that 17—20-mers provide sufﬁcient
speciﬁcity for repeat investigation in rice and barley genomes
(Li et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Wicker et a1., 2008), and our
analysis showed that due to relatively low sequence complexity
of satellite repeats, the k-mer length can be decreased to 10 nt for
this type of sequences. This is well below the 35 nt produced by
the next generation sequencing technologies with the shortest read
lengths. Thus, k-mer analysis provides an opportunity to explore
the growing archives of unassembled sequencing reads produced
by various technologies ranging from Sanger to Solexa/Illumina
or SOLiD sequencing. This represents a signiﬁcant advance in
satellite repeat analysis, which up to now has been mostly based
on multiple alignments of monomers extracted from assembled
sequences, even in species where extensive shotgun sequencing data
are available (Hall et a1., 2003; Lee et a1., 2006). An exception was
the approach developed for using whole-genome shotgun sequence
data for global characterization of higher-order repeat structure of
primate centromeric repeats (Alkan et a1., 2007). However, this
method required paired end Sanger sequencing data and relied on
previous knowledge of higher order repeat sequences.

In addition to rich genomic resources available for the rice
genome, the choice of the CentO satellite as a subject of this pilot
study provided a possibility to compare our results to previous
studies of this repeat using alignment-based analysis (Lee et a1.,
2006; Ma and Jackson, 2006). This control proved the correct
reconstruction of prevailing monomer size of 155 bp as well as
the minor variant with 165 bp monomer (Fig. 5). To simplify
the analysis, we took advantage of the availability of assembled
CentO repeats for similarity-based selection of reads from shotgun
sequencing data and for their arrangement in the same orientation.
However, the same reconstruction procedure can also be used to
reveal sequences of unknown satellites using whole genome reads.
This is because the presence of high numbers of almost identical
monomers in the genome results in a high frequency of k-mers
from the corresponding satellite, which then usually appear on top
of the list of the most frequent genomic k-mers. Consequently,

the sequence reconstruction starting from the most frequent k-mers
preferentially leads to assembly of fragments of satellite repeats. It
should be noted that in this case all fragments will be reconstructed
in duplicate, differing in orientation, due to the random orientation of
sequencing reads. The forward and reverse duplicates of otherwise
identical fragments can be merged, their overlaps identiﬁed and the
monomer size determined by detecting 3’ and 5’ overlaps of the
fragment assembly (Supplementary Material S2). These principles
have been veriﬁed using 454 sequencing data from several species
(our unpublished data) and Solexa/Illumina reads downloaded from
the Arabidopsis 1001 genome project (Ossowski et al., 2008).

Comparison of k-mer spectra calculated from CentO sequences
extracted from whole genome sequencing reads and from CENH3-
associated DNA did not provide any evidence for selection of
speciﬁc CentO variants in functional centromeres. This result can be
explained by the fact that CentO repeats are predominantly located
in the CENH3-associated chromatin in the rice genome. In 9 out of
the 12 rice centromeres, the majority or entire CentO arrays were
mapped in the CENH3-binding domains (Yan et a1., 2008). The
CENH3-binding domains of three rice centromeres, Cen2, Cen6
and Cen11, were not determined (Yan et a1., 2008). However,
Cen2 and Cen6 contain ~716 and 816kb of CentO, respectively
(Cheng et a1., 2002). Thus, the majority of these repeats may
also be associated with CENH3 in these three centromeres based
on the 500—1000 kb average size of the CENH3-binding domains
among the rice centromeres. Cen11 contains ~2 Mb of CentO,
representing the only centromere where large CentO arrays may be
located outside of the CENH3-binding domain. However, it is likely
that the centromeric and pericentromeric CentO arrays on Cen11
may be very similar in sequence, as observed for chromosomes 1
and 12 (Fig. 3).

On the other hand, sequence divergence was detected between
CentO repeats from different chromosomes or their groups,
revealing that CentO homogenization preferentially occurs on intra-
chromosomal level and that spreading of sequence variants to
other chromosomes is limited. A similar conclusion was drawn
based on analysis of the CentO repeats associated with Cen1 and
Cen8 using traditional sequence analysis methodologies (Lee et a1.,
2006). This is analogous to sequence evolution of centromeric
satellites in human and Arabidopsis (Heslop-Harrison et a1., 1999;
Schindelhauer and Schwarz, 2002), as well as some non-centromeric
repeats such as rDNA intergenic spacer-like satellites of Vicia
saliva (Macas et a1., 2003). However, this homogenization pattern
is not universal as there exist satellite repeats in plants that are
homogenized across the chromosomes and their subfamilies are
then conﬁned to speciﬁc chromosomal regions (Macas et a1.,
2006). The methods described here, allowing for easy detection
of different sequence variants and for subsequent design of
corresponding probes, should be instrumental in investigating this
phenomenon further, especially with respect to using the next
generation sequencing data recently generated from individual
chromosomes (Mayer et a1., 2009). Yet another useﬁil application
is using k-mer spectra for detection of similarities in various
distinct types of sequence data, as demonstrated by successful
detection of rice stNAs derived from CentO repeats. Compared
to other similarity detection approaches, this method provides good
sensitivity (the k-mer spectrum represents all sequence variants)
as well as quantitative information about the k-mer frequency of
the hits. The identiﬁcation of CentO stNAs is in agreement

with the study of Lee et a1. (2006) who detected this type of
CentO transcripts using the northern hybridization. The observed
lack of correlation between the abundance of stNAs and the
corresponding CentO k-mers suggests that stNA precursors are
not transcribed from the most conserved CentO sequences. This
could indicate that these transcripts represent a transcriptional noise
driven by transcription of surrounding (non-CentO) sequences.
On the other hand, we found multiple CentO regions (up to
138-bp long) identical to the detected stNAs, which were mostly
scattered within centromeric CentO arrays (data not shown). An
interesting ﬁnding concerns the differences between various tissues
and strands of stNA transcription, which could point to tissue-
speciﬁc transcription and/or processing of CentO transcripts by
RNAi machinery. However, as the abundance of most CentO
stNAs was very low (42% of stNAs had abundance of only
1 TPQ), these observations will have to be validated by deeper
sequencing of small RNAs.

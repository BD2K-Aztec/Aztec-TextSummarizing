ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identification of the sites at which transcription
factors (T Fs) bind to Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an important
problem in molecular biology. Many computational methods have
been developed for motif finding, most of them based on position-
specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) which assume the independence
of positions within a binding site. However, some experimental and
computational studies demonstrate that interdependences within the
positions exist.

Results: In this article, we introduce a novel motif finding method
which constructs a subspace based on the covariance of numerical
DNA sequences. When a candidate sequence is projected into the
modeled subspace, a threshold in the Q-residuals confidence allows
us to predict whether this sequence is a binding site. Using the
TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases, we compared our Q-residuals
detector with existing PSSM methods. In most of the studied
TF binding sites, the Q-residuals detector performs significantly
better and faster than MATCH and MAST. As compared with
Motifscan, a method which takes into account interdependences, the
performance of the Q-residuals detector is better when the number
of available sequences is small.

1 INTRODUCTION

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence motifs are short sequence
patterns with biological function. In the gene promoter region, there
are DNA sequence motifs which hint at the interaction between the
gene regulation machinery and the nucleic acids. They are involved
in several DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) processes, such as the
binding of some proteins to DNA, the ribosome binding to mRNA,
and mRNA processing (D’haeseleer, 2006). Protein biosynthesis
starts with a transcription process. This process, for example in
eukaryotes, is led by several types of RNA polymerase that require
special DNA sequences in promoters and a set of transcription factor
(TF) proteins.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Due to the importance of gene regulation, a major problem in
molecular biology is to discover the location of the transcription
factor binding sites (TFBSs) within the genome. But the fact that
most TFs bind to short, degenerate sequences makes it difﬁcult to
ﬁnd sequence patterns to model the binding sites (Wasserman and
Sandelin, 2004). Many algorithms try to characterize these patterns,
and such algorithms may be classiﬁed into consensus-based methods
or alignment-based methods (Pavesi et (11., 2004).

Most of the algorithms developed target the location of TFBSs.
These follow one of two strategies: (i) to discover common binding
sites into a set of unaligned sequences of co-regulated genes and (ii)
to make use of the previous knowledge of sequences to search for
a motif within a genome (Das and Dai, 2007; Elnitski et (11., 2006;
Hannenhalli, 2008; Sandve and Drablos, 2006).

The algorithms which use the previous knowledge of the binding
site sequences are mostly based on position-speciﬁc scoring matrices
(PSSMs; Stormo, 2000). PSSM are matrices of frequencies of each
nucleotide in each position of the binding site. Some examples
of these algorithms are MATCH (Kel et (11., 2003), which uses
information at each position to construct a PSSM; MAST (Bailey
and Gribskov, 1998), based on the QFAST algorithm and part
of MEME suite (Bailey and Elkan, 2006); rVISTA (Loots and
Ovcharenko, 2004) which uses evolutionary data; and ITEME
(Maynou et (11., 2010) which calculates the information loss of the
binding sites. These models assume that the positions in binding
sites are statistically independent. However, experimental evidence
shows that TFBS have interdependences between positions (Bulyk
et (11., 2002) and some computational studies suggest the same
(Tomovic and Oakeley, 2007). These ﬁndings have motivated the
development of new strategies which take into account position
interdependences. Models based on Markov chains, such as WAM
(Zhang and Marr, 1993), are restricted to modeling interdependences
between adjacent positions. Other algorithms estimate non-adjacent
interdependences using permuted Markov models (Zhao et (11.,
2006); Bayesian networks (Barash et (11., 2003); variable order
Bayesian networks (Ben-Gal et (11., 2005; Castelo and Guigo, 2004)
or graphs (Naughton et (11., 2006). Detectors constructed using
these techniques have higher accuracy, but require the tuning of
many parameters for optimal operation which typically requires a
large number of binding site instances. Additionally, most of these
algorithms are computationally intensive.

On the other hand, a large body of knowledge exists for speciﬁc
event detection in numerical sequences (signals), and the conversion

Detection of transcription factor binding sites

 

of symbolical DNA sequences into numerical DNA sequences
has been widely used in genomic signal processing to extract
relevant biological information from DNA sequences. For example,
numerical conversions have been used to identify protein coding
regions by studying their periodicity (Anastassiou, 2001; Cristea,
2005; Shmulevich and Dougherty, 2007).

In this article, we propose a detector based on the Q-residuals
of a numerical sequences covariance model. This contribution aims
to study to what extent the covariance can capture information on
position interdependences between binding sites. Our hypothesis is
that, when projected into the subspace deﬁned by the covariance,
sequences belonging to the modeled TFBS should have smaller
Q-residuals than chromosomic or random sequences, consequently
Q-residuals could be used to detect binding sites. The proposed
detector was compared with the PSSM-based methods, MAST and
MATCH, using real genomic data. It was also compared with
the Motifscan method which calculates interdependences between
positions.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data

TFBS sequences were extracted from the TRANSFAC 7.0 2005 public
database (Wingender et (11.. 2000) and from JASPAR 2010 (Portales-
Casarnar et (11.. 2010). For the JASPAR database. the motifs with 10
or more sequences were extracted. To carry out the study. we selected
43 motifs corresponding to Homo sapiens. 25 from Mus musculus. 11
from Rattus norvegicus; a further 10 were randomly chosen from all
the TFBS available for Drosophila melanogaster. For the TRANSFAC
database. the 108 motifs with >10 sequences were chosen. These motifs
were multiple-aligned using the CLUSTALW2 algorithm (Larkin et (11..
2007) with default parameters. The alignment was performed N times. where
N is the number of sequences for each motif. using a leave-one-out cross
validation (L.0.0.) procedure. The 23 TFBS motifs having a core with >5
consecutive positions without gaps at each step of the LCD. procedure
were used to compare our method to the existing PSSM algorithms.
These binding sites correspond to eukaryotic organisms of different level
of complexity. ranging from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to H.sapiens and
including D.melan0gaster. R.n0rvegicus. M.musculus and Gallus gallus. The
number of selected sequences from JASPAR totalled 89 motifs. The relation
of the 89 JASPAR motifs and the 23 TRANSFAC motifs is given in the
Supplementary Material 2. and a summary of the TF used for each organism
can be seen in Table 1.

All promoter sequences from the organisms used. with the exception of
S.cerevisiae. were extracted from the Eukaryotic promoter database (EPD)
sequences (Schmid et (11.. 2006). using the EPD version based on EMBL
release 105 (September. 2010). The sequences located at the positions from
—1000 to 500 relative to the transcription start site (TSS) were used to

construct the background model. consisting of the nucleotide frequencies
for the promoters of each organism. In S. cerevisiae. the extracted sequences
correspond to promoter sequences in Chromosomes 1 and 16 of the EMBL
chromosome database (Kanz et (11.. 2005). release 94 (March. 2008).

In each organism. we randomly chose two promoter sequences of length
1501 nucleotides for use as background sequences. In D.melan0gaster. we
used the sequences from —1000 to 500 relative to TSS of FAF gene as
Background 1 and the same range of nucleotides from gene CG12170 as
Background 2. In M.musculus. the same range of nucleotides was set and
the ng’ T gene was used as Background 1. whereas gene ng’ MPC 11 was
used as Background 2. In R.n0rvegicus. Background 1 was extracted from
the myosin LC3fP2 gene and Background 2 from PSBPC2. For H.sapiens.
the promoter corresponding to Background 1 was in the region of the gene
RPS 9P2+ whereas the promoter corresponding to Background 2 was relative
to PSMA2 TSS. In the study of G.gallus. Background 1 was relative to
apoVLDLII TSS and Background 2 relative to a’Aiglobin TSS. Finally. in
S.cerevisiae. the Background 1 sequence generally corresponded to positions
44 730—46 230 in Chromosome 1. However. an exception was made for
ABFl binding sites. since ABFl binding sites are present in that promoter;
for ABFl Background 1. the sequence used corresponded to the positions 678
9307680 430 in this organism’s Chromosome 16 whereas. for Background 2.
the positions from 11 410 to 12 910 in Chromosome 1 were used in all the
organism’s studied binding sites.

2.2 Preprocessing

The aligned matrix of DNA sequences had to be converted to a rectangular
matrix of numerical sequences. The ﬁrst step was to translate symbolic DNA
to numerical sequences using the conversion process proposed by Silverman
and Linske (1986). where each nucleotide is placed at the vertex of a regular
tetrahedron as in Equation (1):

AE(0,0,1)
_ £5 1
= 3 ’ 3 ’ 3
G=<_£_£_1)
3 3 3
_ J5 1
T—< T,0,—§) (1)

where A. C. G and T are points in 3D Euclidian space corresponding to the
a. c. g and t nucleotides. respectively. This conversion was chosen because
it is symmetric for all nucleotides and is widely used in genomic signal
processing (Liew et (11.. 2005).

After conversion. each DNA sequence of length M became a sequence
of length 3 X M . concatenating numerical vectors corresponding to each
nucleotide. Then. the N sequences belonging to the same TF were arranged
in matrix format. The result was an N X (3M) matrix of numerical DNA.

Where gaps were produced during the alignment process. we imputed the
numerical value of these gaps into the mean of the chromosome. taking into
account the nucleotide probability distribution of the background organism
and the conversion process. The location of the gaps within the tetrahedron
is thus given by Equation (2):

GAP=P(a)A +P(c)C+P(g)G+P(t)T (2)

In this equation. GAP is a three-element vector corresponding to the position
of the gap within the tetrahedron; A. C. G and T are the positions of a. c.
g and t nucleotides in the vertexes of the tetrahedron; P(a), P(c), P(g) and
P(t) are the nucleotides probabilities in the promoter of the organism. Only
those positions where the information was available for at least half of the
sequences were imputed. the others were neglected.

2.3 Deﬁnition of the subspace method

A covariance subspace model was computed for each binding motif using
a principal component analysis (PCA) of the numerical DNA sequence
representation (Pearson. 1901). To carry out the PCA. ﬁrst the covariance
of the numerical DNA matrix was calculated. then the data projected into
the subspace where the covariance matrix is diagonal. In this subspace.
relatively few components explain most of the covariance. thus reducing
the dimensionality of the problem. This yields a bilinear decomposition of
the set of aligned DNA sequences as deﬁned in Equation (3):

X=ABT+E (3)

where X is a N X (3M ) TFBS numerical matrix. with N being the number of
TFBS sequences and M the number of TFBS positions. A is the projected
data. consisting of an N ><nPCS matrix called scores. where nPCS is the
number of principal components chosen to construct the subspace. B is the
(3M ) >< nPCS loading matrix which deﬁnes the subspace into which data is
projected. and E is the N X (3M ) error matrix.

The covariance is a 3M ><3M matrix which captures the covariances
between the numerical positions. When it is diagonal. no interdependences
exist between positions of a speciﬁc binding site. This information is. in
our model. explained in the loadings which are almost zero when a position
is conserved. and which differ from zero (either in a positive or negative
sense) when a position varies. In the Supplementary Material 1. an example
of the covariance matrix and the loadings for the DL binding sites. where
covariances exists. is presented.

The detector was built using the Q-residuals. which are the square of
the Euclidean distance from a sequence to the subspace generated by the
Principal Components model. Given a candidate sequence. the Q-residuals
can be calculated using Equation (4):

Q=EET (4)

where E is the 3M error vector obtained from projecting the sequence into
the Principal Components subspace. and Q is the Q-residual of the candidate
sequence.

The model should explain most of the variance and. as outlined above.
sequences belonging to the studied TF should have smaller Q-residuals than
the other sequences. Deﬁning a threshold in Q-residuals should be sufﬁcient
to allow distinguishing between TFBS and sequences not belonging to the
modeled TFBS. The threshold chosen is based on the Q-residuals statistics
(J ackson. 2004). resulting in a conﬁdence interval for a sequence belonging
to our model. The Q-residuals distribution corresponding to the modeled
TFBS sequences are ﬁrst converted into a new N (0.1) quantity C (i.e. C is
normally distributed with mean )1 = 0 and variance 0' = 1). The quantile with
the desired conﬁdence interval can be then calculated from this normal
distribution. The constructed detector depends on the number of principal
components chosen.

2.4 Comparison to PSSM algorithms

To compare our detector to existing PSSM methods. the MEET R package
(available in the R-forge project http:// r-forge.r-project.org/projects/meet).
was developed (Pairo et (11.. 2011). This R package allows us to combine
several alignment methods with different algorithms to search for TFBS
within a large sequence. The package can be conﬁgured to call external
alignment methods including CLUSTALW2. MUSCLE (Edgar. 2004).
and MEME which has as an internal multiple alignment method. The
proposed Q-residuals method is compared both with MAST and with an
implementation of the MATCH algorithm which takes into account the
probability distribution of the nucleotides in the promoter sequences of each
organism.

To implement MATCH. the algorithm explained in Kel et a1. (2003) was
used. however. the background nucleotide probability distribution speciﬁc
for each organism was also used. To detect a motif. ﬁrst the PSSM matrix
was calculated. Then. using this matrix. the information of each position was

calculated as in Equation (5).

where [(i) is the information of position 1'. ﬁg is the frequency of the B
nucleotide in this position and P3 is the background probability of the
B nucleotide. The Score of a sequence of length M was calculated as in
Equation (6).

where fight. is the frequency of the corresponding bi nucleotide for the
sequence in position i and I (i) is the information in the same position. Finally.
a SimilarityScore for the sequence and the core (ﬁrst ﬁve consecutive more
conserved positions). as explained in Equation (7) was used to discriminate
between TFBS and other sequences as in the MATCH program (publicly
available in TRANSFAC 7.0).
. . . ScoreiMin

Comparison with the MAST algorithm was done using the downloadable
MEME 4.4.0 source available at the MEME suiteithis allowed us to
combine different alignment algorithms to construct the PSSM and then
use the PSSM as an input to MAST. To calculate the PCA model and the
Q-residuals in R. the pcaMethods R package was used (Stacklies 21111.. 2007).

CLUSTALW2 with the default parameters. gapextend 20.2. gapopen =
10 was used to align the sequences in all the methods compared in
TRANSFAC.

2.5 Validation

The MEET R package performs a double LCD. to calculate the ROC curves.
the Area under ROC curve (AUC). and the errors associated with them.
Given a motif of N sequences. ﬁrst a sequence A is removed and inserted
into the background sequence. Then. the remaining N — 1 sequences of the
same motif are used for a standard LCD. to construct models with N —2
sequences. These N —2 sequences are ﬁrst aligned and the chosen algorithm
is applied to build a model. Finally. each one of the N —1 models of the
LCD. is used to detect the sequence A within the known position of the
background. After that. sequence A is again inserted into the group and
another sequence B is used. this whole process being repeated N times. As
the location of the true positives is known. the threshold of the detectors
can be varied in order to generate the N different ROC curves and AUCs.
Thresholding is detector-speciﬁc; for Q-residuals it is the residuals statistics
of the PCA model. for MATCH it is the sequence similarity and for MAST
it is the p-Value. Once the N ROC curves are generated. the SD is used to
estimate the variability of the ROC curve points and the AUC.

In the case of the Q-residuals detector. AUC was calculated for from 1 to
10 principal components; in the case of MATCH. the varying parameter was
the Core Similarity. ranging from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05. Only one
set of ROC curves and AUCs was calculated in MAST because the length of
the sequence (the parameter to optimize in MEME) is deﬁned by the number
of positions of the PSSM constructed using the aligned sequences.

The mean and the variance of AUC for the studied range of principal
components were calculated for each motif. Models built using different
numbers of principal components can have an equivalent performance when
the AUC mean and the AUC variance are taken into account. Between these
models. the one with smallest AUC variance averaged between Backgrounds
1 and 2 was chosen as the best model. The same criterion was used to choose
the threshold of Core Similarity in the MATCH algorithm.

As the number of negative examples greatly exceeded the number
of positive examples in this study. it was also convenient to compare

the algorithms using precisionirecall (PR) curves. There exists a unique
correspondence between the PR curves and the ROC curves. and when an
algorithm dominates in the ROC spaces it also dominates in the PR space.
however. optimizing the AUC under the two different methods is not the
same thing (Davis and Goadrich. 2006). To show that the PR curves conﬁrm
the results obtained with the ROC curves. we calculated the curves with the
optimal parameters for each detector (Supplementary Material 3). The ROC
curves. the AUC and the PR curves were calculated using the ROCR package
(Sing at 111.. 2005).

2.6 Interdependences between positions

The improvement in detection of Q-residuals should be linked to the
interdependences between positions in each binding site. To study this
relation. the mutual information M1,», j between positions 1 and j of the binding
sites was calculated using Equation (8):

P1,)”-

where bi and 1)]- correspond to the nucleotides in the studied positions i, j
and Phi is the probability of the bi nucleotide in the position i. The joint
probability of having nucleotide bi in position i and b]- in position j is
described by Pbigbf. The Bayes factor (BF) described in Equation (9) was
used to test the null hypothesis. H0. of independence between positions 1 and
j against H1. the alternative hypothesis of dependence. in order to determine
the signiﬁcance of the dependencies found:

where M is the size of the bindings sites sequences. N1,” is the number of
bi nucleotides in position i and 01 refers to the parameter of the Dirichlet
prior distribution. This measure was used in previous studies to show which
positions of a TF have interdependences (Tomovic and Oakeley. 2007; Zhou
and Liu. 2004). When 011%)”. = 1 and 011,1. zzbobhbf the BF is related to the
mutual information as shown in Equation (10) (Minka. 2003).

log2(BF(H0;H1))% —MMI,»,]- (10)

Formula (10). where MIW- is the mutual information and M the size of the
binding sites. was used to calculate the BF. BF(H0;H1). As in Tomovic and
Oakeley (2007). a threshold of BF < 0.1 was set to indicate strong evidence
of interdependences between positions. For each motif. the percentage of
positions showing interdependences. Idep. was calculated.

2.7 Comparison to Motifscan

Naughton et a1. (2006). used 94 JASPAR (2006) motifs to compare
Motifscan. a graph-based method which takes into account interdependences.
to PSSM methods. To do the comparison. they calculated the ROCN curves.
where N is the number of sequences for the selected motif. and its AUC.

Using the same methodology and 93 of the 94 motifs of the old JASPAR
version (the old version of the remainng one was not available). the AUC of
the ROCN curves was calculated for the Q-residuals detector. and the results
were used to compare the detectors. The comparison between Motifscan
and Q-residuals using the 93 JASPAR motifs is available as Supplementary
Material 4.

presented above and two different backgrounds for each organism.
Then, we describe in more detail the comparison between MAST and
Q-residuals, and show a study of the interdependences. We present
an analysis of the computational time needed for each one of the
studied detection algorithms, and ﬁnally we compare the Q-residuals
detector to the results obtained with Motifscan.

One example of detection can be seen in the cMyB motif in
Figure l, a set of TFBSs for H.sapiens. The ROC curves show
the performance of the three algorithms using the ﬁrst background
for H.sapiens. A signiﬁcant improvement is observed when the
Q-residuals detector is used in place of MAST or MATCH.

To visualize the performance of the three different detectors in all
the studied TFs, Table 2 summarizes the results for Q-residuals,
MATCH and MAST for the two different backgrounds in each
organism for TRANSFAC. The best number of components (usually
between 1 and 4) is shown, together with the mean AUC for each
background and method. The results for all the studied TFs are
available as Supplementary Material 2.

To quantify the differences in performance between the Q-
residuals detector and the other algorithms, a Wilcoxon rank-test
(Wilcoxon, 1945) was performed on the AUC distributions, using
the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same versus the
alternative hypothesis that AUC using Q-residuals is closer to 1 than
when MAST or MATCH are used. In Table 2 and the Supplementary
Material 2, the increment in AUC and the signiﬁcance of the test are
displayed, and it can be seen that Q-residuals performs signiﬁcantly
better than Match in 57 of the 112 motifs studied and signiﬁcantly
better than MAST in 63 of them, with p-value <0.05.

To better visualize the detectors, we present the AUC box plots in
Figure 2. These box plots represent the AUC and its variation when
the L.0.0. is applied. Figure 2 shows the box-plots for the ﬁrst
background and the JASPAR motifs corresponding to M.muscu1us.
In most cases, not only is the mean AUC closer to one in Q-residuals,

organism in TRANSFAC. The AUC shown for each method is the mean of the areas using the cross-validation method and the number of
principal components for Q-residuals is chosen as the number of components with less variance in the AUC. The AAUC is the mean AUC
improvement of Q-residuals versus MATCH and MAST. respectively. The level of signiﬁcance corresponds to the p-Value calculated when a
Wilcoxon-rank test is performed. with the null hypothesis being that the AUC distributions using Q-residuals detector and the other algorithm are
the same and the alternative hypothesis being that the AUC distributions calculated with the Q-residuals detector is closer to one. A description
of the 89 JASPAR motifs and 23 TRANSFAC motifs can be found in the Supplementary Material 2

but the variance is also smaller, which suggests that the Q-residuals
algorithm behaves more robustly.

An average of the PR curves obtained in each leave-one-out
iteration is also presented as Supplementary Material 3, showing
that, when these curves are used, the Q-residuals detector also
performs better than the PSSM algorithms in most of the cases.

The percentage of positions showing interdependences, Idep,
varies among the studied binding sites as can be observed in
Figure 2. A correlation test was performed between the Idep
and the improvement in binding site detection when Q-residuals
detector was compared with MAST. The improvement in binding
site detection was derived by subtracting the mean AUC for each
binding site calculated using each method. Results show a signiﬁcant
correlation between the number of strong interdependent sites within
a binding locus and the amount of improvement of the Q-residuals
detector over MAST (as measured in terms of AUC). Performing
the test on the results for JASPAR database gave a p-value:
0.004; the corresponding result for the TRANSFAC database was a
p-value = 0.04.

The computational times of the Q-residuals detector, of MAST
and of our R implementation of MATCH were compared for
the detection of TFBS within promoter sequences. To compare the
three algorithms, the MAST algorithm (MEME version 4.4.0), the
C code for Q-residuals using the ideal number of components,

and our implementation of MATCH algorithm in R with the
ideal Core Similarity were used. The background corresponded
to Background 1 for each organism—this consisted of 1500
nucleotides. The threshold for each method was set in such a way
that the number of positives was similar. In the case of MAST
a p-value of p = 0.001 was chosen, for Q-residuals a conﬁdence
interval of C = 0.95 was set, and for MATCH the Similarity was
set to S = 0.85. The time was calculated for 100 iterations of
the program. The average computational time in detection for the
TRANSFAC database motifs are 0.003 :I: 0.001 s using the Q-
residuals detector, 0.0191 :I: 0.001 s using MAST and 0.33 :I: 0.03 s
for the R implementation of MATCH. The results show that the Q-
residuals detector is faster than MAST and the R implementation of
MATCH in all the studied binding sites.

The Q-residuals detector was also compared with Motifscan, an
algorithm which takes into account interdependences. Using the
same criteria as Naughton et (11. (2006), a 5% increase in the ROCN
AUC was required for an improvement to be considered signiﬁcant.
The results showed that in 34 of the 93 studied motifs Motifscan
performs better than either the Q-residuals detector or the PSSMs
methods, that Q-residuals is the best detector in 25 of the 93 motifs
whereas PSSM is best in just 1 of them. The three detectors perform
equally well in 16 motifs; Q-residuals and Motifscan are equally
good and better than PSSM in 16 motifs; Q-residuals and PSSM

are better than Motifscan in 3 motifs; and Motifscan and PSSM are
better than Q-residuals in 9 of the 93 motifs. The AUC performance
is shown in the Supplementary Material 4. A visualization of the
results in Figure 3 shows that the performance of Q-residuals is
more sensitive to the number of positions. When the sequences are
short, the number of false positives using the Q-residuals detector
increases, leading to a smaller AUC. Motifscan performs better
in this situation but, on the other hand, it needs more training
sequences, so when the number of sequences is small, Q-residuals
performs better than Motifscan. Focussing on the 37 motifs which
have <20 sequences available, in 43.24% of the cases the AUC
of Q-residuals shows it to be signiﬁcantly the best algorithm,
whereas Motifscan is best in just 27.02% of the instances. In most
cases, even if Motifscan is signiﬁcantly better than Q-residuals,

the Q-residuals algorithm performs better than PSSM methods for
this comparison also.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Calculating the residuals of the covariance model of the numerical
TFBS has been demonstrated to be an effective method of detecting
TFBS within real data, with better performance than existing MEME
and MATCH methods.

The results show that, when there are no interdependences,
our method is at least as good as the PSSM methods we used
for comparison, but we also found a correlation between the
improvement in AUC and the percentage of positions showing
interdependences in a TF. This result proves that covariance can

capture position interdependences in TFBS, and that a covariance-
based model can be useful in detecting TFBS within large databases.

When we compared the computational time of the Q-residuals
detector and PSSM-based methods, we found that Q-residuals
is faster; in contrast, other methods which take into account
interdependences usually carry a high-computational cost. Another
advantage of the Q-residuals detector, as compared with methods
which take into account position interdependences, is that Q-
residuals does not need a large amount of data in order to build
a reliable detector.

The ideal number of components was chosen following a
robustness criterion, biasing sequence background independence.
Usually the number of components which satisﬁes the above
condition is small, models having between 1 and 4 components
explain most of the variance of the motif. Differences in detection
using a range of components are not always signiﬁcant.

As compared with a method which takes into account
interdependences, Q-residuals shows a signiﬁcant performance
improvement when the number of sequences is small, but it also
shows a larger sensitivity to the number of positions. Q-residuals
needs more positions than Motifscan or PSSM to decrease the
number of false positives.

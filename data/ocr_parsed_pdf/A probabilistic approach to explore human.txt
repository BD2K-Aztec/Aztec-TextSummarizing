other orthogonal sequence—based features such as conservation
(Friedman et al., 2009) into a probabilistic score.

The proposed model differs from most of the previous expres—
sion—based target prediction methods in three important
aspects. First, our model is speciﬁcally designed for miRNA—
overexpression experiments to interrogate targets of a particular
miRNA in a speciﬁc cell condition. To our knowledge, only a
few methods are suitable for such task (Liu et al., 2010a). Most
existing methods such as GenMiR++ (Huang et al., 2007) and
GroupMiR (Le and Bar—Joseph, 2011) are based on global
miRNA—target expression correlation, which requires a large
set of expression proﬁles of both mRNA and miRNA measured
across various distinct conditions and may miss targets that are
speciﬁc to only a subset of the input samples. Second, the pro—
posed model is unsupervised such that it infers miRNA—targets
solely based on their distinct high—dimensional patterns of
expression fold—changes and sequence features. However, the
existing methods are mostly regression—based frameworks by
treating gene expression as response and miRNA expression as
input variables (Huang et al., 2007; Le and Bar—Joseph, 2011) or
supervised learning by explicitly operating on a training dataset
of confidence positive and negative targets (Liu et al., 2010b;
Sumazin et al., 2011), which are incomplete and difficult to
obtain. Third, our method operates on the entire gene set to
more closely model the overall likelihood rather than only on a
subset of genes prefiltered by targetScan score (Huang et al.,
2007) or sample variance (Le and Bar—Joseph, 2011).

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

We describe a novel probabilistic method for miRNA target prediction
problem by integrating miRNA-overexpression data and sequence-based
scores from other prediction methods. Brieﬂy, each score feature is con-
sidered an independent observed variable as input to a variational
Bayesianﬂaussian mixture model (VB-GMM). We chose a Bayesian
over a maximum likelihood approach to avoid overﬁtting. Speciﬁcally,
given expression fold-change (due to miRNA transfection), we use a
three-component VB-GMM to infer downregulated targets accounting
for genes with little or positive fold-change [due to off-target effects
(Khan et al., 2009)]. Otherwise, two-component VB-GMM is applied
to unsigned sequence scores. The parameters for the VB—GMM are opti-
mized using variational Bayesian expectation maximization algorithm.
The mixture component with the largest absolute means of observed
negative fold-change or sequence score is associated with miRNA targets
and denoted as ‘target component’. The other components correspond to
the ‘background component’. It follows that inferring miRNAimRNA
interactions is equivalent to inferring the posterior distribution of the
target component given the observed variables. The targetScore is com-
puted as the sigmoid-transformed fold-change weighted by the averaged
posteriors of target components over all of the features (3).

2.2 Bayesian mixture model

Assuming there are N genes, we denote x 2 (X1, ...,XN)T as the log
expression fold-change (x)) or sequence scores (x1). Thus, for L sets of
sequence scores, x e {x}, X], . . . , xL}. To simplify the following equations,
we use x to represent one of the independent variables without loss of
generality. To infer target genes for a miRNA given x, we need to obtain
the posterior distribution p(z|x) of the latent variable z e {21, ...,zK},
where K=3 (K :2) for modeling signed (unsigned) scores such as
logarithmic fold-changes (sequence scores).

We follow the standard Bayesian GMM based on Bishop (2006, pp.
474482) with only minor modiﬁcations. Although univariate GMM
(D = 1) is applied to each variable separately, we implemented and de-
scribe the following formalism as a more general multivariate GMM,
allowing modeling the covariance matrices. Brieﬂy, the latent variables
z are sampled at probabilities JT (mixing coefﬁcient), that follow a
Dirichlet prior Dir(rr|oz0) with hyperparameters a0 =(oz0~1, ...,oz0~K).
To account for the relative frequency of targets and non-targets for
any miRNA, we set the 010.1 (associated with the target component) to
aN and other a“ = (1 — a) X N/(K— 1), where a = 0.01 (by default).
Assuming x follows a Gaussian distribution N(x|p,, A’l), where A (pre-
cision matrix) is the inverse covariance matrix, 170),, A) together follow a
GaussianiWishart prior  Nmklmo, (ﬁOA)’1)W(Ak|W0, v0), where the
hyperparameters {mm/30, W0, v0} 2 U2, 1,IDX0,D +1}.

2.3 Variational Bayesian expectation maximization

Let 6 = {z, 71, u, A}. The marginal log likelihood can be written in terms
of lower bound £(q) (ﬁrst term) and KullbackiLeibler divergence
IC£(q|[p) (second term):

_ 17(Xa 9) 4(9)
1mm) — / [1(9) In M + qunnmmx) (1)

where q(6) is a proposed distribution for p(6|x), which does not have a
closed form distribution. Because lnp(x) is a constant, maximizing £(q)
implies minimizing IC£(q||p). The general optimal solution 1an(9,-) is the

 

 

expectation of variable j with respect to other variables, [Egg-[1n p(x, 6)].
In particular, we deﬁne q(z, 71, u, A) = q(z)q(rt)q(p,, A). The expectations
for the three terms (at log scale), namely, ln q* (Z), In q*(rt), ln q*(p,), have
the same forms as the initial distributions due to the conjugacy of the
priors. However, they require evaluation of the parameters {Z,JT,}.L,A},
which in turn all depend on the expectations of z or the posterior of
interest:
pnk
17(anlxme) E [Elzrrk] = K 
21:1 pnj

where

1n pa = [Eun m + % [E[1n 1AA” —%1n(2n) — 1E”). [(x" — Mumm—
up]. The inter-dependence between the expectations and model param-
eters falls naturally into an expectation-maximization (EM) framework,
namely variational Bayesian expectation maximization. Brieﬂy, we ﬁrst
initialize the model parameters based on priors and randomly sample K
data points u. At the I'm iteration, we evaluate (2) using the model par-
ameters (VB-E step) and update the model parameters using (2) (VB-M
step). The EM iteration terminates when £(q) improves by <10’20 (de-
fault). Please refer to Bishop (2006) for more details.

 

2.4 TargetScore

We deﬁne the targetScore as an integrative probabilistic score of a gene
being the target I of a miRNA:

targetScore = a(— log FC)  Z p(t|x)) (3)
xe(x/.xl . ....XL}

where a(— logFC) = W, p(t|x) is the posterior in (2).

2.5 miRNA-overexpression data collection

We collected miRNA-overexpression data corresponding to 84 Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) series, 6 platforms, 77 human cells or tissues
and 113 distinct miRNAs (Supplementary Table S1). To our knowledge,
this is by far the largest compendium of miRNA-overexpression data.
To automate data downloading and processing, we developed a pipeline
written in R, making use of the function getGEO from GEOquery
R/Bioconductor package (Davis and Meltzer, 2007). For each dataset,
the pipeline downloads and quantile normalizes (if necessary) the expres-
sion data and calculates (when necessary) the log fold-change (logFC) in

treatment (miRNA transfected) versus (mock) control. For mRNAs
interrogated by multiple probes in a single experiment, we took the aver-
age of the fold-changes. Each of the 286 data vectors contains logFC
values for N 5 18560 RefSeq mRNAs (i.e. with preﬁx NM for known
protein coding mRNA obtained from University of California, Santa
Cruz) due to transfection of one of the 113 miRNAs. For two logFC
vectors associated with the same miRNA transfection (conducted in dif-
ferent studies), we removed mRNAs for which neither of the vectors
contains a logFC value and ﬁlled the remaining missing values in one
vector with the non-missing values in the other. For more than two
logFC vectors for the same miRNA transfection, we removed mRNAs
absent in all of those vectors and performed imputation for the remaining
missing values using impute . knn from impute R package (Troyanskaya
et al., 2001). Finally, we picked one representative logFC vector per
miRNA, which has the highest Pearson correlation with the binary
vector of the validated targets (Hsu et al., 2011) or averaged them if no
validated target was available. As a result, we have 113 logFC data vec-
tors for 113 distinct miRNA transfections.

2.6 Comparison with other prediction methods

We compared targetScore with seven published methods (Table 1).
Among these methods, Expmicro is the only method that also uses
miRNA-overexpression data. The other six methods are sequence-
based, and their predictions are ﬁne-tuned by the authors and the results
provided on their Web site are the most accurate ones. Thus, we only ran
Expmicro locally on the same test data and directly downloaded the
target predictions by the other six programs from their corresponding
Web sites. Speciﬁcally, predictions on all target sites (including conserved
and non-conserved sites) from targetScan 6.1 were obtained for both
context+scores (CS) and probability of conserved targeting (PCT).
The latest PicTar2 target predictions were obtained from doRiNA
database (database of RNA interactions in post-transcriptional regula-
tion) (Anders et al., 2011). The miRanda predictions for sites with both
good and non-good mirSVR scores were obtained at http://www.micro
rna.org/. For Probability of Interaction by Target Accessibility (PITA)
predictions, the accessibility energy AAG on target sites ﬂanked by
3/15 nt upstream/downstream (‘3/ 15 ﬂank’) was chosen as recommended
by the authors (Kertesz et al., 2007). SVMicro predictions were ob-
tained from http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/svmicro.html. Expmicro was
run on the SVMicro scores and expression fold-changes (Liu et al.,
2010a).

Table 1. Comparison between miRNA target prediction methods

2.7 Evaluation

2.7.1 Gold standard Experimentally validated targets were down-
loaded from mirTarBase (Hsu et al., 2011) (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.
edu.tw). MirTarBase is one of the most comprehensive databases that
support bulk download and agree with other databases such as TarBase
(V ergoulis et al., 2012) and miRecords (Xiao et al., 2009). MirTarBase 3.5
contains 3565 validated interactions between 432 human miRNAs
and 1959 target genes. The average (median) number of targets per
miRNA is 8.2 (3).

2.7.2 Methods of comparison We ﬁrst compared the performances
of using logFC and the six methods that use sequence information alone
(Table 1) in discriminating validated targets from the rest. To have a
reliable estimate, we selected the test data corresponding to miRNAs
that have at least three validated targets from mirTarBase and at least
1 predicted target from each of the predictors. Based on the results, we
then picked two overall best sequence-based methods. The scores from
those two methods were then integrated along with logFC into the pro-
posed targetScore Equation (3). Next, we modiﬁed our testing set by
including miRNAs that have at least one target predicted from each of
the two best-performing sequence-based methods and at least 10 vali-
dated targets from mirTarBase. Finally, we evaluated the performances
of logFC and sequence-based methods alone in comparison with
Expmicro (Liu et al., 2010a) and the proposed targetScore.

2. 7.3 Systematic evaluation For each comparison, the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of the methods were systematically assessed using receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve and summarized by the area
under the curve (AUC) (Fig. 2). For a given score cutoff, the true- and
false-positive rates (TPR and FPR) are estimated as the respective ratios
of TPR = TP/P and FPR = FP/N, where TP and FP are the numbers of
true and false positives, and P and N are the total numbers of positive
and negative miRNA targets within the test data. Predicted targets outside
of the test data were not counted. ROC is plotted by iteratively evaluating
TPR (y-axis) and FPR (x-axis) while relaxing the scoring cutoff. In add-
ition, we constructed precision-recall (PR) curve (PRC) and assessed the
precision TP/(TP+FP) of each method at the same recall (or TPR).
Comparing to ROC, PR is more informative in evaluating the perform-
ance at the top predictions. Both ROC and PR statistics were obtained
using ROCR package (Sing et al., 2005).

2.7.4 Evaluation using proteomic data To further evaluate the per-
formance of each method, we used the available protein output data

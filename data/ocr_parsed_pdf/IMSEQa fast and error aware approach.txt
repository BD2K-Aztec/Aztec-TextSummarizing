Abstract

Motivation: Recombined T— and B—cell receptor repertoires are increasingly being studied using
next generation sequencing (NGS) in order to interrogate the repertoire composition as well as
changes in the distribution of receptor clones under different physiological and disease states. This
type of analysis requires efficient and unambiguous clonotype assignment to a large number of
NGS read sequences, including the identification of the incorporated V and J gene segments and
the CDR3 sequence. Current tools have deficits with respect to performance, accuracy and docu—
mentation oftheir underlying algorithms and usage.

Results: We present IMSEO, a method to derive clonotype repertoires from NGS data with sophisti—
cated routines for handling errors stemming from PCR and sequencing artefacts. The application
can handle different kinds of input data originating from single— or paired—end sequencing in differ—
ent configurations and is generic regarding the species and gene of interest. We have carefully
evaluated our method with simulated and real world data and show that IMSEO is superior to other
tools with respect to its clonotyping as well as standalone error correction and runtime
performance.

Availability and implementation: IMSEO was implemented in C++ using the Squn library for effi—
cient sequence analysis. It is freely available under the GPLv2 open source license and can be
downloaded at www.imtools.org.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

T- and B-cells are lymphocytes that form part of the adaptive or that diversity is that in the germline genome there is no functional
acquired immune system in vertebrates. These cells express an anti- TCR or 1G gene. Instead, it is generated by recombination of germ-
gen receptor on their surface, the T—cell receptor (TCR) or B-cell line encoded gene segments as well as random base additions and
receptor/Imrmmoglobulm (1G), which is responsible for the recogni- deletions upon differentiation of T- and B-cell precursors in the thy-
tion of antigens. Due to the enormous number of potential antigens, mus and bone marrow. This somatic recombination process is

referred to as V(D)]—recombination and explained in more detail in
the following section. The cells transmit their recombined receptor
gene to daughter cells upon proliferation, allowing for a targeted im-
mune response against antigens.

Recently, methods have been developed to enrich these recom-
bined genes in order to capture the repertoires of unique gene se-
quences using next generation sequencing (NGS). The derived data,
i.e. populations of such unique gene sequences, referred to as clono—
types, can be used to better understand how the adaptive immune
system works. The underlying samples for this analysis can be full T
or B cell populations from blood, urine, biopsies or other sources or
antigen specific subpopulations that have been exposed to antigen
in vitro and subsequently selected for activation markers using
methods such as flow cytometry. Also, specialized cells (e.g. regula-
tory, memory or effector T cells) can be sorted with immunopheno-
typing protocols.

NGS based T- and B-cell clonotype analysis thus opens up new
possibilities of qualitative and quantitative repertoire assessment.
Recently, such methods were applied for TCR and IG repertoire
analysis in healthy and diseased conditions. A number of data char-
acteristics can be measured and are medically relevant, including
repertoire size and diversity under different conditions or for differ-
ent subpopulations as well as shared clonotypes across different in-
dividuals and the tracking of particular clonotype subgroups.
Applications in medical and clinical research include the identifica-
tion and tracking of clonotypes with known antigen specificities in
vaccination studies (Jackson et al., 2014; Vollmers et al., 2013), dif-
ferential diagnosis in transplant patients (Dziubianau et al., 2013) or
the usage of clonotypes as biomarkers in patients with lymphoid
malignancies (Wu et al., 2012).

Here, we present IMSEQ, a method to derive clonotypes from
NGS sequence data. It can recognize and correct likely sequencing-
or PCR-errors, can quickly process large datasets and was exten-
sively tested on simulated and experimental data. We also show that
it outperforms currently available software tools. IMSEQ is open
source and available online (http://www.imtools.org).

1.1 Preliminaries

The generation of a functional TCR or IG gene follows the same
principle and will be briefly explained using the TCR as an example.
In humans, the TCR gene locus consists of an ac and a [i chain. The
TCR/i locus on chromosome 7 has a cluster of over 50 variable (V)
segments located at some distance to other clusters, two diversity
(D) segments and 13 joining (J) segments. During differentiation of
T lymphocytes in the thymus, somatic recombination in the thymus
leads to the production of a functional TCR/i gene with one V, D
and J segment each as well as a constant, conserved (C) segment.
Additional diversity is added through random nucleotide removal
and addition at the junction sites between the segments. A homolo-
gous process governs recombination of both the TCRs and the IGs,
which are protein complexes that comprise two subunits, the beta
(TCRB) or heavy chain (IGH), as well as the alpha (TCRA) or light
chain (IGL). All four genes undergo an analogous somatic recombin-
ation process, however, the TCRA and IGL genes comprise only a V
and J segment without an intervening D segment.

The structure of a recombined TCRB locus is shown in Figure 1.
Given the number of functional gene segments in the human genome
as well as the average number of nucleotides randomly added or
removed at the junction sites, it has been estimated that the size of
the theoretical space of clonotypes that can be generated is on the
order of 1018 (Janeway et al., 1999). In Uil/O, about 106 unique TCR

Fig. 2. Read positioning supported by IMSEO. The V(D)J region must be cov-
ered by a single read. This also reflects the minimal configuration, as shown
in (A). A second read covering additional parts of the V region as shown in
(B) is optional and improves the accuracy of the V segment identification. If a
paired-end configuration where the reads overlap (Cl is chosen, the reads
must be pre-processed and merged before IMSEO analysis

recombinations (clonotypes) among 1012 cells were detected in the
peripheral blood of humans (Arstila et al., 1999).

The recombined genes are commonly enriched by a multiplex
PCR targeting the V and J segments. Different target sites result in
different sequencing read positions. The configurations supported
by IMSEQ are shown in Figure 2.

1.2 Technical artifacts in TCR and IG sequencing

PCR amplification and sequencing are error-prone processes, mainly
due to false base incorporations. These errors cause the detection of
additional unique clonotypes which are in fact not present in the
sample, particularly when the errors lie within the hypervariable
CDR3 region, since it cannot be compared with any reference and
redundancy through coverage (Sims et al., 2014) cannot be applied
to handle these errors. Sequencing reads usually come with a quality
score per base and it is common practice to define a quality thresh-
old for reads to be discarded. False base incorporations do however
not occur independent of the sequence, hence they can alter the
derived clonotype frequency distributions if reads are selected for
their quality scores. An extreme case of such a distribution change is
shown in Figure 3. This analysis demonstrates that it is preferable to
process the raw data in an attempt to correctly assign the clonotypes
of low-quality reads rather than removing them.

Another technical artifact that can occur in TCR and IG gene se-
quence data are primer induced base substitutions due to multiplex
PCR amplification. If a primer designed to amplify a fragment incor-
porating segment A binds to a fragment incorporating segment B
due to similarity in the primer sequence, the replicated sequence will
have false base incorporations making it more similar to segment A
at the primer binding site. Generally, this only plays a role forJ seg-
ment identification, since for single-end (SE) V(D)J reads the V pri-
mer site is usually not part of the read and for paired-end data there
is sufficient V segment sequence present in the V read to safely

same clonotype can be unambiguously assigned, then it is possible
to correct the ambiguous reads under the assumption that relatively
few clonotypes share the same CDR3 region and that this is unlikely
to coincide with overlapping V— and J—segment assignments. Thus, in
order to correct for additional clonotypes induced by such segment
matching ambiguity, we partition the set of unique clonotypes C
into sets of clonotypes that share the same CDR3 sequence,
C : {CL - - - ,C;}. For every ordered pair of clonotypes (C1, 62) where
61,62 ECf,615£62 IMSEQ checks whether the set of identified
V and] segments of C1 are a subset of or equal to the corresponding
sets of 62, i.e. V(C1) Q V(62) A](61) 21(62). If that is the case,
the pair (61, 62) is added to the set of correctable clonotype pairs
73. After all pairs in one clonotype subset have been checked,
the count of every clonotype Ce is distributed among all
6* E {6, 1 (6,,62) E 73}, maintaining the frequency ratios among
these clonotypes. This procedure is repeated for all clonotype sub—
sets contained in C.

2.2.2 Quality clustering

Erroneous base calls inside the CDR3 region generate new clono—
types, i.e. increase the repertoire size, and falsify the clonotype fre—
quencies, as they affect some clonotypes more than others due to the
sequence dependency of sequencing errors (Dohm et al., 2008). To
keep this bias as low as possible, reads with low quality bases should
also be incorporated into the analysis. This requirement, however,
increases the demand for error correction inside the CDR3 sequence.
Therefore, we perform a post—processing step that checks for every
identified clonotype cluster whether it is likely to be erroneously
derived from another clonotype cluster. Let qk(6) denote the mean
sequencing quality of the kth base within the CDR3 region among
all reads that were clonotyped as 6 and 5(6) and raw) denote the
mean and SD of these mean qualities. In order to consider clonotype
cluster 66 to be an erroneous version of 6,, we demand that the same
V and J segments were identified in 66 and 61, that their CDR3 se—
quences are of the same length and differ only in eﬁm positions and
that

qk(ce) 35(Ce) _ 5min ' Jq(6e)

for all k E (5”(6i, Ce), where 5min and eq are user—defined parameters

max
(see Section 2.2.4) and (5”(6i,6e) is the set of positions at which Ci
and 6e differ. Clonotype pairs that fulfill these conditions are stored
and the counts of erroneous clonotype clusters redistributed as

described in Section 2.2.1.

2.2.3 Simple clustering

Errors in the multiplex PCR or library preparation steps are not
associated with reduced sequencing quality scores, but usually dis—
play a low edit distance to a genuine clonotype. Additionally to the
quality dependent clonotype clustering approach described in
Section 2.2.2, we therefore also implemented the same clustering ap—
proach without the quality score requirement, i.e. simply based on a
threshold eS

max for the maximum number of errors inside the CDR3

region. In contrast to quality clustering, this step can therefore cor—
rect PCR errors. However, there is a risk that this clustering method
might erase true positive clonotypes that are highly similar to other
clonotypes.

2.2.4 Clustering parameters

The two clustering methods previously described are performed in a
combined fashion. That is, given two clonotypes that differ in given
number of positions inside the CDR3 region, if only some of them

can be explained by a low—quality score clustering will still be per—
formed if the number of remaining errors is less or equal than that
allowed in the simple clustering step. The default parameters for the
number of allowed errors are eq

max
S
based and emax

: 4 and 5mm : 1 for quality
: 1 for simple clustering. The parameters can be ad—
justed by the user. Optionally a maximum ratio 11(Ce) /n(6i)§rfmx
can be configured, where 11(Ce) denotes the count of the erroneous
clonotype and n(6,) denotes the count of the target clonotype for

clustering.

2.3 Implementation

IMSEQ was implemented in C++ using Squn (Doring et al., 2008)
and is available for download at www.imtools.org. In the most basic
setup it requires the reference V and J segment sequences in FASTA
format with annotations that indicate the positions of the Cys104
and P116118 triplets in the segments as well as at least one input file in
FASTA or FASTQ format. GZIP compression is supported for all in—
put files. The program can write different kinds of output files. The
most verbose output file is a tab separated file containing detailed
per—read information such as the identified V and J segment(s), the
begin and end position of the CDR3 region, the number of V and J
bases aligned outside the CDR3 region as well as the error positions
among those bases. IMSEQ can also write aggregated files with (po—
tentially corrected) clonotype counts, using either nucleotide or
amino acid—based clonotype identities. Furthermore, a file contain—
ing the IDs of all rejected reads associated with the rejection reason
such as low sequence quality, out of frame CDR3 boundaries or
stop codons inside the CDR3 can be written.

3 Clonotyping evaluation

We compared IMSEQ to five other tools: HighV—QUEST (Li et al.,
2013), Decombinator (Thomas et al., 2013), MITCR (Bolotin et al.,
2013), MIGEC—CdrBlast (Shugay et al., 2014) and TCRklass (Yang
et al., 2015). TCR beta chain genes were simulated as described in
the following section, and Illumina reads were simulated using
Mason 2 (Holtgrewe, 2010). Additionally, data from a real sequenc—
ing experiment was analyzed.

3.1 Data simulation

We simulated VDJ—recombined human TCRB genes by implement—
ing a simple model: The V, D and J segments are chosen uniformly
from the set of functional gene segments as defined by the IMGT
(Giudicelli et al., 2005 ). For every junction and involved segment, nd
nucleotides are removed from the segment end, up nucleotides are
added as a complementary palindrome and Mn nucleotides are added
randomly. For every junction, an overlap of 110 nucleotides is created
between the involved segments and nucleotide mismatches are
resolved randomly. The distributions for the parameters 11,,1,11p,11n
and 110 were manually tuned such that the CDR3 length distribution
matches the one observed in five deeply sequenced (average 7.5 mio.
reads), unspecific TCRB repertoires from different donors. To in—
corporate PCR errors, a simple replication model was used where in
every cycle every sequence has a probability of Pr to be replicated
and every base incorporation has a probability of PS to to result in a
random false base. Insertions and deletions were not considered in
the PCR model.

3.2 Dataset description
We generated two human TCR—l} gene datasets, one with 5 X 105
unique clonotypes and one with 150 unique clonotypes. To simulate

the data as realistically as possible, the reference segments passed to
the simulator were truncated according to the enrichment PCR
primer sites used by Dziubianau et al. (2013). As some of the tools
come with their own gene segment reference data, in order to
exclude effects of different reference segment datasets, only seg-
ments denoted as ‘functional’ in the IMGT reference database were
used during the simulation, as this can be considered the minimal set
of gene segments that should be supported by all tools. The first
dataset was kept error-free and used to validate the basic clonotyp-
ing functionality of each tool tested. The dataset was also tested
against IMGT HighV-QUEST in order to ensure that the clonotype
simulation generated valid sequences. The second dataset was in-
silico PCR-amplified to a total size of 1.5 X 105 sequences using a
per cycle amplification probability of Pa : 0.8 and a per-base substi-
tution probability of Pe : 10‘4, referred to as PCR. Finally, another
dataset was generated, introducing sequencing errors into each of
the PCR amplified fragments and reducing the fragment length
to 150 bp in order to establish conditions that correspond to real
sequencing as closely as possible. This step was performed
using Mason 2 (Holtgrewe, 2010), using its default error profile op-
tions. This dataset is referred to as PCR +Seq. Although the
simulator provides paired-end data, only the VDJ-read was used
for the analysis since not all of the tools in our comparison can han-
dle paired-end data. A separate evaluation showing the improve-
ment of split paired-end (SPE) workflows is presented in Section 4.

Additionally, data originating from a real experiment was ana-
lyzed to show the runtime performance in real life applications as
well as differences in the estimated number of clonotypes. The
dataset originates from antigen unspecific CD4+T cells which
were prepared according to the protocol described by Dziubianau
et al. (2013) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq sequencing sys-
tem. The dataset is referred to as real data and contains 3 504 203
reads.

3.3 Evaluation criteria

To assess the clonotyping and repertoire generation performance,
two different evaluations were performed. One assesses the perform-
ance only on a clonotype level, i.e. discarding the frequencies of the
clonotypes, and the other evaluation assesses the per-read clonotyp-
ing performance.

3.3.1 Clonotype level evaluation

In many studies it is crucial to know whether or not a clonotype is
present in a sample, while its exact frequency is less important. That
includes different measures to assess the diversity of a sample, which
are affected by over- or underestimation of the number of clono-
types or comparative methods that take into account whether or not
two samples share a clonotype. Hence, if clonotypes are falsely
removed from a repertoire, i.e. due to over-clustering or biased clo-
notyping, or if insufficient error handling enlarges the number of
clonotypes in the repertoire, the performance of these methods will
suffer. Therefore, one of the evaluations we performed is a binary
classification based on the presence and absence of clonotypes in the
repertoires generated by the different methods.

3.3.2 Per read clonotyping performance

Because the competing tools do not provide per-read result informa-
tion, the performance was estimated based on the clonotype fre-
quencies. That is, given the simulated count of a clonotype 71c and
the detected count of that clonotype nc’, we define the number of

true positive, false positive and false negative read to clonotype as-
signments for a particular clonotype 6 as

FPC : max (0,71c’ — 71c)
FNC : max (0,71C — nc’)

TPC : min (715,715’).

The overall number of events is computed as the sum of events over
all simulated and detected clonotypes.

3.4 Tool parameters

The tools DECOMBINATOR, HighV-QUEST and MIGEC-
CdrBlast were run with their default parameters. None of these tools
support error correction and therefore could not be parameterized
in that respect. Each tool comes with their own set of reference se-
quences for human TCRB gene segments. To assess only the core
clonotyping capability, the correction-capable tools were instructed
to skip clustering (MITCR maxClusterizationRatio:0, IMSEQ -
qcme 0 -scme 0). For the erroneous datasets PCR and PCR+SEQ
and the real data, MITCR was invoked with default parameters and
the IMSEQ parameters were set as indicated.

4 Paired-end evaluation

To assess the impact of an SPE protocol versus an SE protocol under
real world conditions, we analyzed 14 different (8 antigen specific
and 6 polyclonal) samples on an Illumina MiSeq machine in paired-
end mode with 100 bp forward reads and 200 bp reverse reads. The
reads were then processed using IMSEQ, once in a 100/100 bp
paired-end setting and once in a 200 bp SE setting. For each setting,
the analysis was performed with and without segment ambiguity
clustering (Section 2.2.1). The results depicted in Figure 5 show the
proportion of V segment ambiguity removed relative to the 200 bp
SE analysis without segment ambiguity clustering.

5.1 Clonotyping and error correction

The results of the clonotyping performance for all tools are shown
in Table 1. The evaluation of the error-free dataset analysed by
IMGT HighV—QUEST shows that the simulated TCRB gene se-
quences are valid and correctly labelled according to the IMGT
naming scheme. IMSEQ can correctly clonotype all provided

sequences in absence of any errors and also TCRklass reports only
correct clonotype assignments, missing a small fraction of the reads
resulting in a recall of 99.9%. MIGEC—CdrBlast also derives almost
all clonotypes correctly with a very low number of false positive and
false negative calls. MITCR fails to clonotype some reads correctly,
resulting in about 94% precision and recall for both reads and
clonotypes. Decombinator clonotypes only 57% of the reads cor—
rectly, generally having difficulties to define the CDR3 region
correctly, which confirms previous results by Bolotin et al. (2013).
Decombinator was therefore excluded from the subsequent evalu—
ations. IMGT HighV/QUEST was only included to verify the valid—
ity of the simulated data, but was not included in the subsequent
tests because it is of no practical use for the analysis of real world
NGS data—it is limited to 500 000 reads, performs only per read
clonotyping without repertoire generation and error correction,
there is no standalone software and the online analysis of a dataset
usually takes days.

For sequences with PCR errors, IMSEQ has the highest read level
recall and precision even without any posterior clustering (99%
each). It recovers all clonotypes, however, generates additional clo—
notypes which aren’t corrected for without clustering (CT precision
79%). MIGEC—CdrBlast, which doesn’t support error clustering,
performs similarly. It is unclear whether TCRklass performs any
kind of error correction inside the CDR3 region, however, it’s per—
formance is only slightly better than that of MIGEC—CdrBlast, indi—
cating that it doesn’t. With simple clustering enabled, IMSEQ
outputs only correct clonotype assignments and covers 99% of the
input reads. MITCR again performs worse than IMSEQ with about
95% precision and recall for both reads and clonotypes.

The evaluation with 150 bp sequencing reads simulated from the
dataset containing PCR errors firstly illustrates the impact of poster—
ior error correction. MIGEC—CdrBlast and IMSEQ without cluster—
ing detect about 10 000 unique clonotypes, whereas only 150 are
actually present in the sample. Again, TCRklass performs only

slightly better than these tools, overestimating the total number of
clonotypes to be 8666. With both clustering methods enabled,
IMSEQ detects 185 clonotypes with a 100% recall and 81% preci—
sion. On the read level, precision and recall reach 99%. MITCR per—
forms again about 5% worse than IMSEQ in read precision as well
as read and clonotype recall, the clonotype precision drops to 14%
due to the many false positive clonotypes called. Overall, MITCR
detects 1026 unique clonotypes.

Finally, the experimental data revealed a large variability regard—
ing the number of clonotypes detected across the different tools. As
expected, the tools that do not perform any correction of sequencing
and PCR errors report the largest number of clonotypes (MIGEC—
CdrBlast 34 006 and TCRklass 37 514 clonotypes). However, there
is also a more than threefold difference between MITCR (6213 clo—
notypes) and IMSEQ (20 725). Manual inspection revealed that
MITCR clusters all clonotypes with the same CDR3 sequence—even
if they have clearly distinct V or J segments incorporated and add—
itionally fails to detect some, even highly abundant clonotypes for
no apparent reason. All tools were able to assign clonotypes to
~72% of the reads, except for MIGEC—CdrBlast, which detected
clonotypes for only 65% of the input sequences.

The runtimes were measured on a dual 6—core Intel Xeon X5675
(3.06 GHz) Mac Pro system with 64 GB of RAM running Mac OS
10.9. This does not apply to IMGT/HighV—QUEST, which is a web—
service hosted by the IMGT consortium. IMSEQ, MITCR and
MIGEC—CdrBlast are multi—threading capable and were therefore
run utilizing all 24 CPUs (including hyper—threading) presented by
the operating system. Among the locally run tools regarding the 500
000 unique sequences dataset (error-free), IMSEQ processed the
data in 37 s, followed by MITCR requiring 57 s. The other tools
were significantly slower, i.e. the DECOMBINATOR analysis took
231 s, MIGEC—CdrBlast 393 s and TCRklass 341 s.

The PCR dataset was processed in 3 s by MITCR and IMSEQ,
MIGEC—CdrBlast required 75 and TCRklass 99 s. The PCR+Seq

dataset analysis required 6, 7 and 10 s (no clustering, simple— and
combined error correction) using IMSEQ, 4s using MITCR, 40s
using MIGEC—CdrBlast and 79 s using TCRklass.

Last, the experimentally generated dataset was processed rela—
tively quickly by MITCR (37 s) and IMSEQ (69 5), while MIGEC—
CdrBlast required 228 s and the single threaded TCRklass
took > 20 min to process it.

5.2 Split paired—end sequencing

The SPE data evaluation shows the impact of SPE sequencing (as de—
picted in Fig. 2B) on two types of real datasets, eight antigen—specific
and six polyclonal repertoires. It shows that 100 bp SPE sequencing
in conjunction with posterior segment ambiguity resolution can
drastically reduce the V segment ambiguity compared with a SE—
sequencing configuration with 200 bp, i.e. the same overall read
length. The posterior clustering can correct a limited amount of am—
biguity on the 200 bp SE data, i.e. 80—98% of the ambiguous clono—
types remain after correction compared with the 200 bp SE data
without correction for the polyclonal data and 62—95% for the anti—
gen—specific data. Running the analysis on the 100 bp SPE data
instead reduces the number of ambiguous clonotypes down to 40—
75 % in the polyclonal and down to 18—61% in the antigen—specific
case. In conjunction, i.e. when processing the 100 bp SPE dataset
with posterior ambiguity clustering, almost all ambiguity can be
resolved in the antigen specific samples (0—4% ambiguous clono—
types remain). In the polyclonal datasets the reduction leaves 20%
or less of the ambiguous clonotypes.

5.3 Segment alignment analysis

Because IMSEQ computes the full alignment between the gene seg—
ments and the input read, it can also reveal details about those align—
ments and the errors encountered in the input reads.

Supplementary Figure 51.1A shows the match/mismatch fre—
quencies along the TRBJ 2—7 segment observed in a sample of unspe—
cific CD8 +T cells generated from the detailed IMSEQ output. The
genes were amplified using the multiplex PCR primers published by
Dziubianau et al. (2013). In the underlying sample, >40 000 reads
originated from clones that incorporate the TRBJ 2—7 segment. The
distribution of alignment errors across the positions clearly shows
that positions 17, 27 and 28 mismatch in about 50% of the reads,
positions 23 and 26 even in about 75% of the reads. Supplementary
Figure 51.13 shows the alignments of the TRBJ 2—7 gene (bases up—
stream the Phe triplet are omitted) against the primers designed to
amplify genes incorporating the TRBJ segments 1—1 and 1—6. All the
error positions are explained by unspecific binding of the TRBJ 1—1
primer, while positions 23 and 26 additionally suffer from unspe—
cific binding of the TRBJ 1—6 primer.

An example for the alignment match/mismatch distribution in
the V segment is shown in Supplementary Figure 51.1C. When the
recombined gene is sequenced from the J segment, i.e. reverse, the
coverage is uniform in the] segment while it varies towards the end
inside the V segment, depending on the length of the J segment and
the CDR3 region. The fewer V segment bases are covered by the
read the higher is the chance that, in a SE experiment, the V segment
cannot be uniquely identified.

Therefore, IMSEQ’s detailed per—read alignment error diagnos—
tics provide valuable information about potential issues regarding
the gene enrichment and sequencing to the experimentalist. The
data can be used to detect and quantify unspecific primer binding
artifacts, analyze the V coverage distribution and also to detect
errors in the reference database or new alleles.

6 Conclusion

We have presented IMSEQ, a fast and flexible tool for TCR/1G rep—
ertoire analysis from NGS data. Our method is capable of handling
SE as well as overlapping and SPE data. Apart from per—read clono—
typing it also features error correction methods to resolve false clo—
notype calls originating from PCR and sequencing errors as well as a
method to correct for ambiguously assigned gene segments.

The results produced by IMSEQ were thoroughly validated using
simulated data. The tools performance was compared with that of
other state of the art standalone TCR/IG clonotypers available,
namely DECOMBINATOR, TCRklass, MITCR and MIGEC—
CdrBlast. Our evaluations show that the clonotyping capabilities of
IMSEQ are superior to those of DECOMBINATOR and MITCR
while being comparable to those of MIGEC—CdrBIast and TCRklass.
However, IMSEQ substantially outperformed the latter tools with re—
spect to runtime.

When it comes to the error correction performance, IMSEQ could
only be compared with MITCR, and showed superior performance es—
pecially with regards to the precision of clonotype detection. MIGEC—
CdrBlast has additional requirements for the experimental setup,
namely the incorporation of UMIs, to be able to perform any kind of
error correction. DECOMBINATOR does not support error correc—
tion at all and was also excluded from the evaluation due to its poor
clonotyping performance. The TCRklass error correction does not
seem to include the CDR3 region and therefore does not effectively re—
duce the number of false clonotype calls due to errors.

The evaluation of the impact of SPE sequencing showed a great
improvement in V segment accuracy when compared with SE
sequencing with the same overall read length.

To conclude, IMSEQ is a rapid, well tested, flexible and error—
aware clonotyping and repertoire generation tool that was shown to
be superior to available tools with regard to clonotyping and stand—
alone error correction capabilities.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Fragment recruitment, a process of aligning sequencing
reads to reference genomes, is a crucial step in metagenomic
data analysis. The available sequence alignment programs are
either slow or insufficient for recruiting metagenomic reads. We
implemented an efficient algorithm, FR-HIT, forfragment recruitment.
We applied FR-HIT and several other tools including BLASTN,
MegaBLAST, BLAT, LAST, SSAHA2, SOAP2, BWA and BWA-SW to
recruit four metagenomic datasets from different type of sequencers.
On average, FR-HIT and BLASTN recruited significantly more reads
than other programs, while FR-HIT is about two orders of magnitude
faster than BLASTN. FR-HIT is slower than the fastest SOAP2, BWA
and BWA-SW, but it recruited 1—5 times more reads.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metagenomic data provide a more comprehensive picture for
our understanding of the microbial world. An important step
of such understanding is to compare the raw sequencing reads
against the available microbial genomes to analyze the phylogenetic
composition, genes and functions of the samples. Such a procedure,
referred to as fragment recruitment, was introduced in the Global
Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenomics study (Rusch et (11., 2007).

Sequences from metagenomic samples exhibit great differences
from the available genomes. Although there are thousands of
available complete microbial genomes, they hardly cover the broad
and diverse species in many metagenomic samples. A typical
metagenomic dataset may have hundreds or thousands of species,
and many of them are novel. Therefore, it is critical for fragment
recruitment methods to align reads to homologous genomes.

In the GOS study, BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1997) was used
for fragment recruitment. However, it is too slow to handle
large datasets. The explosion of next-generation sequencing data
stimulated the development of new mapping programs, such as
SOAP (Li et (11., 2008), Bowtie (Langmead et (11., 2009), BWA
(Li and Durbin, 2009) and many others. These programs are
several orders of magnitude times faster than BLAST, but they
can only identify very stringent similarities that tolerate only a few

mismatches and gaps. So these mapping programs are insufﬁcient
for fragment recruitment. The slightly slower programs like BLAT
(Kent, 2002), SSAHA2 (Ning et (11., 2001) and LAST (Kielbasa
et (11., 2011) can recruit more reads than the mapping programs, but
their fragment recruiting capacities are still limited. In this article,
we present a new fragment recruitment method, FR-HIT. Given
reference genomes, metagenomic reads and sequence identity and
alignment length cutoffs, the goal of FR-HIT is to align the most
reads to references with minimal computational time.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

FR-HIT ﬁrst constructs a k-mer hash table for the reference genome
sequences. Then for each query. it performs seeding. ﬁltering and banded
alignment to identify the alignments to reference sequences that meet
user-deﬁned cutoffs.

2.1 Constructing k-mer hash table

The reference genome sequences are converted into a k-mer hash table.
The default value of k is 11 and can be adjusted from 8 to 12. We include
overlapping k-mers at an equidistant step from reference sequences. A
reference sequence of length m contains (m—k)/ (k— p)+1 k-mers with an
overlap of 17 bases. Here. [7 is also a user-adjustable parameter. The hash table
stores the indexes of reference sequences and the offset positions of k-mers
on reference sequences.

2.2 Seeding

Seeding identiﬁes candidate blocks. which are fragments of reference
sequences that can be potentially aligned with the query. For each query.
we count all its overlapping k-mers and scan the k-mer hash table to collect
the k-mers shared by reference sequences.

We identify pieces of reference sequences that the query can be aligned
to. These pieces are anchored by the shared k-mers. For a reference. any
cluster of Z 2 pieces within 11 bases will derive a candidate block. This block
covers all the pieces in that cluster and has extra 11 bases at each end. Here.
I) is the bandwidth to be introduced in Section 2.4. If two candidate blocks
overlap. they are joined together into one candidate block. We repeat this
until no overlapping blocks are observed.

2.3 Filtering

Filtering removes the candidate blocks that do not enclose qualiﬁed
alignments. K—mer ﬁltering was originally used in QUASAR (Burkhardt
at al.. 1999). Two sequences of length n with Hamming distance 8 share at
least n+ 1 — (8+ 1)k common k-mers (J okinen and Ukkonen. 1991; Owolabi
and Mcgregor. 1988). Here. 8 is the number of mismatches in an alignment.
Based on user-deﬁned length and sequence identity cutoffs. we calculate
the number of mismatches and reject the candidate blocks that do not have
enough common k-mers. In this step. the length of a k-mer is 4.

2.4 Banded alignment

FR-HIT performs banded alignments (Pearson and Lipman. 1988) between
the query and the candidate blocks that passed the ﬁlter. The bandwidth is
also a user-deﬁned value. For each candidate block. the band that contains the
most shared k-mers is used. If a reference sequence has multiple candidate
blocks. these blocks are sorted by the number of shared k-mers in decreasing
order. Banded alignments are performed in this order. and if t banded
alignments do not recruit this query. no more banded alignment is tried for
this reference. Here. t is a parameter with default value of 10.

2.5 Implementation

FR-HIT is written in C++ and distributed at http://weiZhongli-lab.org/frhit
with documentation and testing data. FR-HIT takes reference sequences
in FASTA format and queries in FASTA or FASTQ format and produce
recruitment results. If a query hits multiple references or multiple locations
of a reference. FR-HIT reports all these alignments. Currently. FR-HIT does
not support reads in color space.

3 RESULTS

We applied FR-HIT on four metagenomic datasets and compared it
with BLASTN, MegaBLAST, SOAP2, BWA, BWA-SW, SSAHA2,
BLAT and LAST. The ﬁrst dataset has 1 million 75 bp Illumina
reads from MetaHIT sample MH0006 (Qin et (11., 2010). The other
three datasets are from 454 GS20, GSFLX and Titanium platforms,
with 688 590, 288 735 and 502 399 reads, respectively. Their average
lengths are 99, 233 and 345 bp, respectively. The GS20 and GSFLX
datasets were downloaded from CAMERA (Sun et al., 2011) under
IDs SCUMS_SMPL_ArCtic and BATS_SMPL_174-2. The Titanium
data were from NCBI under accession SRR029691. For the Illumina
dataset, we used the 194 human gut genomes from MetaHIT study
as reference. For the 454 datasets, we used the 1985 completed
bacterial genome sequences downloaded from NCBI in April 2010
as references. The two reference databases are 1.139 and 3.823 GB
in size.

A read is considered recruited if it is aligned to a reference with
330bp and 380% identity. Such cutoffs represent a basic need for
fragment recruitment, to recruit more reads and to prevent obviously
spurious hits. More discussions and examples of parameters are
available in Supplementary Material. Parameters of all the programs
are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The CPU time and the
number of recruited reads are shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table S3. FR-HIT’s results with different parameters are provided
in Supplementary Table S4. On average, FR-HIT and BLASTN
recruited signiﬁcantly more reads than other programs, FR-HIT is
~ 2 orders of magnitude faster than BLASTN. FR-HIT is slower than
the fastest mapping programs SOAP2, BWA and BWA-SW, but it
recruited 1—5 times more reads. In these tests, FR-HIT shows better
recruitment rate and speed than SSAHA2. FR-HIT is slightly slower
than MegaBLAST, BLAT and LAST, but it recruited much more
reads than them. Using the Illumina data as an example, BLASTN
recruited 475 584 reads in 7168 min. SOAP2 used 1.5 min, but only
recruited 141 417 reads. FR-HIT recruited 523 868 reads in 45 min.
Metagenomic data contain many novel species, so 49—64% of reads
cannot be recruited by FR-HIT. Due to the use of overlapping
k-mers, FR-HIT needs more memory than other programs. It used
~4 and 8 GB for the two reference databases in these tests.

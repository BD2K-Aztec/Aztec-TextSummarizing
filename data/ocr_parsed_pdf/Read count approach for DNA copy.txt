ABSTRACT

Motivation: The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies
is revolutionizing our ability in discovering and genotyping DNA copy
number variants (CNVs). Read count-based approaches are able to
detect CNV regions with an unprecedented resolution. Although this
computational strategy has been recently introduced in literature,
much work has been already done for the preparation, normalization
and analysis of this kind of data.

Results: Here we face the many aspects that cover the detection
of CNVs by using read count approach. We first study the
characteristics and systematic biases of read count distributions,
focusing on the normalization methods designed for removing
these biases. Subsequently, we compare the algorithms designed
to detect the boundaries of CNVs and we investigate the ability
of read count data to predict the exact number of DNA copy.
Finally, we review the tools publicly available for analysing read
count data. To better understand the state of the art of read count
approaches, we compare the performance of the three most widely
used sequencing technologies (lllumina Genome Analyzer, Roche
454 and Life Technologies SOLiD) in all the analyses that we perform.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human genomes are Characterized by genetic variants that range
from the single base pair to large Chromosomal events. Recent
studies have Clearly shown that human genomes differ more
as a consequence of structural variants than of single-base pair
differences (Conrad et (11., 2010; Durbin et (11., 2010; Iafrate et (11.,
2004; Kidd et (11., 2008; McCarroll et (11., 2008; Fang et (11., 2010;
Redon et (11 ., 2006; Sebat et (11 ., 2004; Tuzun et (11 ., 2005). Structural
variants (SVs) are operationally deﬁned as genomic events >50 bp
(Alkan et (11., 2011) that include copy number variants (CNVs)
and balanced rearrangements such as inversions and translocations.
With the sequencing of human genomes now becoming routine,
the Challenge is to discover the full extent of structural variations
and understand its effect on human diseases, complex traits and

evolution. The last few years have seen the emergence of several
high-throughput sequencing (HTS) platforms that are based on
various implementations of cyclic-array sequencing (Bentley et (11.,
2008; MCKernan et (11., 2009; Wheeler et (11., 2008). The commercial
products that are based on this sequencing technology include
the Roche’s 454, the Illumina’s Genome Analyzer (GA), and the
Life Technologies’s (LT) SOLiD. Although these platforms are
quite diverse in sequencing biochemistry as well as in how the
array is generated, all of them allow to sequence millions of short
sequences (reads) simultaneously and are able to sequence a ﬁill
human genome per week at a cost 200-fold less than previous
methods.

The advent of HTS platforms has opened many opportunities
for the study of genomic variants. The ﬁrst HTS-based approach
to detect SVs was based on paired-end read mapping (PEM),
which identiﬁes insertions and deletions by comparing the distance
between mapped read pairs to the average insert size of the genomic
library. Although this method is able to identify deletions <1 kb with
high sensitivity, it does not allow for the discovery of insertions
larger than the average insert size of the library and of the exact
borders of SVs in complex genomic regions rich in segmental
duplication (Dalca et (11., 2010; Medvedev et (11., 2009). An altenative
HTS-based approach is based on split-read (SR) methods that allows
to detect deletions and small insertions on the basis of a split
sequence-read signature: the alignment to the genome is broken
and a continuous stretch of gaps in the read indicates a deletion
or in the reference indicates an insertion. Although SRs approach
can be devised to detect a wide range of SV Classes with exact
breakpoint resolution, it is currently reliable only in the unique
regions of the genome. In this scenario, a very promising approach
for the identiﬁcation of SVs using HTS technologies consists in
measuring the number of reads aligned to the human reference
genome (Dalca et (11., 2010). Assuming the sequencing process is
uniform, the number of reads mapping to a region is expected to be
proportional to the number of times the region appears in the DNA
sample. Following this assumption, the copy number of any genomic
region can be estimated by counting the number of reads [read counts
(RCs)] aligned to that particular region. Campbell et (11. (2008) and
Chiang et (11. (2009) were the ﬁrsts to use this approach to detect
copy number alterations between tumour and healthy samples of the
same individual, while Yoon et (11 . (2009) proposed to use RC data to
look for genomic regions that differ in copy number between normal
individuals of the 1000 Genomes Project (Durbin et (11., 2010).
At present, few algorithms for RC analysis have been packaged

into pipelines and are publicly available, including RDxplorer
(Yoon et (11., 2009), ReadDepth (Miller et (11., 2011), CNAseg
(Ivakhno et (11., 2010), CNV-seq (Xie and Tammi, 2009), JointSLM
(Magi et (11., 2011) and CNVnator (Abyzov et (11., 2011) (see Table 1
and Supplementary Material). The analysis pipeline implemented
in these packages for discovering CNVs is conceptually derived
from array-CGH (aCGH) data analysis and can be divided into four
ﬁindamental steps:

0 RC data preparation.

0 Data normalization.

0 CNV regions identiﬁcation.
0 Copy number estimation.

Data preparation consists in ﬁltering and counting the number of
mapped reads in non-overlapping genomic windows of length W.
Once the RCs have been estimated, the ﬁrst transformation applied
to the data, referred to as normalization, adjusts the individual
RC to appropriately mitigate systematic biases so that meaningful
biological comparisons can be made. Normalized RCs are then
sorted according to genomic position and statistical methods are
applied to detect the boundaries of the regions with Changed copy
number. The last step of the analysis pipeline consists in estimating
the DNA copy number of each region within breakpoints. In the
present article, we face the many aspects that cover the detection of
CNVs by using RCs approach. We study all the steps necessary to
infer the copy number of a genomic segment: RC estimation, RC
normalization, CNV regions detection and copy number estimation.
To better understand the state of the art of RC approach, we
compare the performance of the three most used sequencing
technologies (Illumina GA, Roche 454 and Life Technologies
SOLiD) by using both high (20—40><) and low coverage (4—
6X) sequencing data generated by the 1000 genomes project
consortium (see Table 2 and Supplementary Material for more
details).

2 METHODS

2.1 Data preparation

RC method belongs to the category of resequencing approaches, and the
ﬁrst fundamental step of this analysis consists in mapping the set of
short reads against a reference genome by means of short read aligners

(see Supplementary Material). Once short reads have been aligned to the
reference genome, we need to perform a series of preparation steps before
RC estimation. These steps include:

0 Removal of duplicated sequences.
0 Removal or ﬂagging of sequences with low mapping quality (MQ).
0 Choice of the best window/bin size.

The main purpose of removing duplicates is to mitigate the effects
of PCR ampliﬁcation bias introduced during library construction. All the
analyses performed in this article have been made on aligned data with
duplicated reads removed by means of rmdup command of samtools (Li
et (11., 2009) (Supplementary Material). After duplicated reads removal,
low MQ sequences need to be taken into consideration: sequences with
low MQ score usually fall in repetitive regions of the reference genome
or have low base quality. For these reasons, Magi et a1. (2011) and Yoon
et a1. (2009) removed all the reads with MQ < 30. Conversely, Abyzov et a1.
(2011) used the reads with MQ score equal to zero to classify CNVs called
in duplicated or retrotransposon regions of the reference genome. Finally,
the best window/bin size needs to be estimated. Yoon et a1. (2009) and Magi
et a1. (2011) chose a window size of 100 bp for the high coverage data
of the 1000 genomes project (2041-0X coverage) because a larger window
size would provide less precision in deﬁning the breakpoints of CNVs and
because at 30>< coverage, the distribution of RCs of 100 bp windows are
well approximated by a normal distribution, while RCs in smaller window
sizes are not. Ivakhno et a1. (2010) used a bin size of 50 bp for the analysis of
the COLO-829 malignant melanoma cell line sequenced at 40>< coverage.
Abyzov et a1. (2011) found that the optimal bin size, and thus breakpoint
resolution accuracy, scales inversely with the coverage, resulting in ~ 100 bp
bins for 2&30 >< coverage, ~ 500 bp bins for 46 X coverage and ~ 30 bp bins
for 100>< coverage. At present, only two papers have introduced a method
to automatically estimate the best window size. Miller et a1. (2011) propose
to estimate the best window size by modelling RCs by means of a negative
binomial distribution. They generate a negative binomial distribution with
mean 11:)» (with A =N>l<W/G, where N is the total number of read, W is
the bin size and G is the genome size), and size parameter QZA/(i— 1),
where i is the index of dispersion. Then they generate distributions using
the expected number of reads with copy number of one, two and three, and
choose a threshold value for gains and losses that minimizes the number of
bins that are misclassiﬁed. The FDR can then be calculated as the number
of misclassiﬁed bins divided by the total number of bins. Xie and Tammi
(2009) calculate the best possible resolution (i.e. the best possible window
size) according to a preset value for signiﬁcance level [7 and CNV detection
threshold r (Supplementary Material).

2.2 RC biases and normalization

RCs data are affected by two main sources of bias: the local GC content and
the genomic mappability. The correlation between read coverage and DNA

All the data were ﬁrst used by Durbin et a1. (2010).

GC content has been reported in several papers: Harismendy et a1. (2009)
analysed human sequences generated by the Roche 454, Illumina GA and the
LT SOLiD technologies for the same 260 kb in four individuals concluding
that read depth of coverage decreases with increasing AT content for all the
three platforms. Similar results were found by Dohm et a1. (2008) and Hillier
et a1. (2008). Mappability bias (Miller et (11., 2011) is due to the fact that
the genome contains many repetitive elements and aligning reads to these
positions leads to ambiguous mapping. In order to minimize the effect of
these sources of variation and make data comparable within and between
samples, RCs need to be normalized. At present, there are two approaches
for correcting RC data for sequencing biases due to local GC content. Chiang
et a1. (2009) proposed to mitigate the dependence between local GC content
and RC by using the ratio of the number of reads in tumour DNA and its
paired normal DNA, processed at the same time. Yoon et a1. (2009) proposed
to adjust the RCs by using the observed deviation in coverage for a given
GC percentage. In practice, for all the GC percentages (0, 1, 2,  , 100%)
they determined the deviation of coverage from the genome average and
then corrected each RC according to the following formula:

R—o= Rci- 1. (1)

mGC

where RC, are read counts of the i-th window, mGC is the median RC of all
the windows that have the same GC percentage as the i-th window, and m is
the overall median of all the windows.

Mappability normalization has been faced in two different papers. Miller
et a1. (2011) proposed to correct for mappability by multiplying the number
of reads in a given bin by the inverse of the percent mappability in that
region, whrease Ivakhno et a1. (2010) proposed to use an undecimated
discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to smooth RCs in the regions of low
alignability. Here we propose to correct RC for mappability bias with a novel
normalization scheme inspired by the GC content normalization of Yoon
et a1. (2009): RCs are corrected by using the observed deviation in coverage
for a given mappability score. Each RC is corrected by the following formula:

R—C,=RC,-

 

- (2)
mMAP
where RC, are RCs of the i-th window, mMAp is the median RC of all the
windows that have the same mappability score as the i-th window, and m is
the overall median of all the windows.

2.3 CNVs detection algorithms

Once the RCs have been corrected for local GC content and mappability, the
data that we obtain are mathematically very similar to the signal obtained

from aCGH experiments. Deletions or duplications are identiﬁed as decrease
or increase of RC across multiple consecutive windows. Moreover, like
aCGH data, RC signals are affected by noise caused by mapping errors
and random ﬂuctuations in genome coverage. For these reasons, the events
in RC data can be detected using the same algorithmic approaches that have
been used for aCGH data. At present, few statistical methods have been
developed and tested for the detection of CNVs from RC data. Some of
these algorithms come from microarray literature while others have been
tailored for this kind of data. Campbell et a1. (2008) and Miller et a1. (2011)
used the circular binary segmentation algorithm (CBS) (Olshen et (11., 2005),
originally developed for genomic hybridization microarray data, and both
applied it to sequencing data generated by the Illumina GA platform. Magi
et a1. (2011) extended the shifting level model (SLM) (Magi et (11., 2010)
algorithm to detect recurrent CNVs across multiple samples and tested its
performance on Illumina high coverage data from 1000 genomes project
samples. Abyzov et a1. (2011) exploited a mean-shift algorithm (MSB),
previously applied to the analysis of aCGH data, to partition RC signals
to the end of detecting CNVs. MSB was tested on data produced by Illumina
and SOLiD platforms. Yoon et a1. (2009) developed a new method based
on signiﬁcance testing (EWT) that works on intervals of data points: EWT
searches the entire genome for speciﬁc classes of small events that meet
criteria of statistical signiﬁcance, and then clusters of small events are
grouped into larger events. EWT was applied to high coverage Illumina data
produced by the 1000 genome project consortium. Xie and Tammi (2009)
used a sliding window approach, named CNV-seq, to analyse the ratios
between RCs from two individuals (Normal and Tumour). The observed
ratios are assessed by the computation of the probability of a random
occurrence, given no CNV. Xie and Tammi (2009) tested their algorithm
on shotgun sequencing data of Dr Craig Venter and Dr James D. Watson
generated by Sanger and 454 platforms, respectively. Ivakhno et a1. (2010)
introduced CNASeg, an HMM-based algorithm to segment the RC data,
followed by a segment merging step. The CNASeg method was originally
applied to cancer sequencing data generated by the Illumina GA platform.
While the ﬁrst four statistical methods require only one sample at once,
the approaches of Xie and Tammi (2009) and Ivakhno et a1. (2010) need the
sequencing data of two samples. The EWT and CNV-seq methods are sliding
window approaches that converts RC data into a statistic (t-statistic for CNV-
seq and Z-score for EWT) and infer altered regions by using the distribution
of that statistic. Conversely, the CBS, SLM, MSB and CNASeg algorithms
are segmentation methods that allow to split RC data into segments, each
containing the same number of DNA copies. Segments with an altered
DNA copy number are detected by means of a simple threshold method
(Campbell et (11., 2008; Ivakhno et (11., 2010; Magi et (11., 2011; Miller et (11.,
201 1).

2.4 Copy number estimation

The statistical methods introduced in the previous section allow for the
identiﬁcation of genomic regions with altered DNA copy counts by detecting
the border of consecutive windows with increased or reduced RCs. Once
the limits of the altered region has been detected, the estimation of DNA
copy number (genotyping) for those regions must be performed. Campbell
et a1. (2008), Yoon et a1. (2009) and Magi et a1. (2011) estimated DNA
copy number by rounding the median of the RCs (normalized to copy
number 2) of each detected region to the nearest integer, while Abyzov
et a1. (2011) assigned copy number to each genomic region by calculating
its RC signal normalized to the genomic average for the region of the same
length. These simple estimation strategies follow the assumption that the
sequencing process is uniform and consequently the number of read that
maps to a genomic region is expected to be proportional to the number of
times the regions appears in the DNA sample: a genomic region that has
been deleted (duplicated) will have less (more) reads mapping to it than a
region not deleted (duplicated).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data ﬁltering and bin size estimation

To understand the effect of removing sequences with low MQ on
RC distributions, we calculated the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
for different MQ threshold and different windows size W (see
Supplementary Material for more details) and the results are reported
in Supplementary Figure S 1. The SNR has been calculated by means
of the following formula:

SNR: 4,. (3)
(7

where m is the median value of the normalized RC of genomic
regions predicted as two copies while (72 is the variance of the
normalized RC of regions predicted to be one copy by McCarroll
et (11. (2008). The results of these analyses show that ﬁltering out
reads with low MQ slightly affects the SNR of RC data. These
results suggest not to remove low MQ reads, since they can be used
for subsequent analysis as in Abyzov et (11. (2011).

In order to investigate the performance of the two bin size
estimation methods proposed by Xie and Tammi (2009) and Miller
et (11. (2011), we simulated sequencing data for different coverage
for the three HTS platforms (see Supplementary Material for more
details). The results of these analyses are reported in Supplementary
Figure S2. As expected, the larger is the coverage of the sequencing
data and the smaller is the bin size predicted by the two methods.
The method proposed by Xie and Tammi (2009) estimates bins of
similar size for the Illumina and SOLiD platforms. This is due to
the fact that the Xie and Tammi estimation procedure does not take
into account the overdispersion of RC distributions. Conversely,
the approach proposed by Miller et (11. (2011) allows for a better
estimation of the bin size for the three HTS technologies, taking
advantage of the use of the index of dispersion. However, the bin
sizes predicted by the two methods are not optimal: for Illumina
platform, at 30x coverage, the Miller method estimate a bin size of
1000 bp, while at 5x coverage it estimates a bin size of 6600 bp.
These estimates are at least 10 times higher than those reported by
Yoon et (11. (2009), Magi et (11. (2011) and Abyzov et (11. (2011): for
instance, by using a bin size of 100 bp for 20—30>< coverage data,
the J ointSLM and EWT algorithms were able to detect CNV regions
as small as 500 bp with a true positive rate >08 and with a minor
fraction of false positive events of this size (Magi et (11., 2011). The
use of the bin sizes estimated by the method of Miller et (11. (2011)
(i.e. 1000 bp for high coverage) does not allow for the detection of
CNVs as small as 500 bp leading to a loss of resolution and accuracy
in the discovery of genomic variants.

3.2 RC distribution and biases

The detection of CNVs using RC analysis is based on the assumption
that the reads are randomly and independently sampled from any
location of the test genome with equal probability. Under this
assumption, the distribution of the count of reads that map into a
window of the reference genome should be Poissonian. However,
Bentley et (11. (2008) and Yoon et (11. (2009) have previously reported
that RCs by Illumina GA follow a Poisson distribution with a slight
overdispersion. In order to study the properties of RC distribution,
we analysed high and low coverage sequencing data generated by the
1000 genomes project consortium and we used different values of W
for the three HTS platforms (see Supplementary Material for more

HTS platforms [Illumina GA (3), Roche 454 (b) and LT SOLiD (c)] for three
different window size (W = 1000 bp, W 22000 bp and W = 5000 bp). For

details). The results of these analyses are summarized in Figure 1
and Supplementary Figure S3 and Clearly show that RC data can be
modelled by means of a negative binomial distribution. According
with the results of Bentley et (11. (2008) and Yoon et (11. (2009),
we found that RC distribution for Illumina and SOLiD platforms
exhibit an index of dispersion (ratio between variance and mean)
largely greater than one. Conversely, 454 platform produces the RC
data distribution with the lower ratio between variance and mean
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

The overdispersion of RC data distributions can be accounted for
to three main sources:

0 The existence of genomic regions of duplications and
deletions (CNVs).

0 The correlation between read coverage and the DNA local GC
content.

0 The correlation between read coverage and the mappability
(i.e. the inability to map reads into repetitive regions of the
genome).

The effect of CNV regions on the distribution of RC data are reported
in Figure 2a, d and g, in Supplementary Figure 4a,d and g and
in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. The current estimation of the

fraction of the genome subject to variation of the copy number is
~3 .7% (Conrad et (11., 2010). This means that a considerable amount
of genomic regions contains an average number of reads smaller or
greater than the global average number of reads. The removal of
genomic regions with known CNVs reduces the index of dispersion
of RC data distribution for all the three HTS platforms for high and
low coverage data.

We investigated the relationship between RC and GC content
(Supplementary Materials) for all the three HTS platforms and
according with the results of Harismendy et (11. (2009), Dohm et (11.
(2008) and Hillier et (11. (2008) we observed that RC is maximum
for values of GC content between 35% and 60% while it decreases
at both extremes. In particular, we observed that GC content bias
is larger for GA and SOLiD platforms, while it is smaller for the
ROCHE data (see Figures 2b, e and h and Supplementary Fig. S4).

This is conﬁrmed by the statistics reported in Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4, where the percent variation between the raw
index of dispersion and the GC index of dispersion is much larger
for GA and SOLiD data than for the Roche data. The analysis
of regional mappability (Figure 20, f and i and Supplementary
Fig. S4) show a strong correlation between RC data and genome
mappability: the RC distribution for high mappability score is
Closer to Poissonian than genomic regions with low mappability
(low mappability regions show large RC overdispersion). Moreover,
for GA and 454, the mappability has little effect on the mean
number of aligned reads at each bin of mappability score, while,
for SOLiD platform, the mappability strongly affect the RC mean
value. Also these results are conﬁrmed by the statistics reported in
Supplementary Tables S3 and S4: the percent variation between the
raw index of dispersion and the mappability index of dispersion
is very large for the SOLiD platform (65% and 83% for high
coverage and about 60% for low coverage) while it is comparable
to other source of variation for GA and 454 platforms. This can also
explain why SOLiD platform shows the highest value of the index
of dispersion.

3.3 RC data normalization

In order to evaluate the performance of the ﬁve normalization
approaches described in Section 2, we applied them to the high
and low coverage data generated by the 1000 genomes project
consortium and the results of these comparisons are reported in
Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S5 for GC content and in
Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S6 for mappability. The ratio
approach proposed by Chiang et (11. (2009) (see Figure 30, f and
i and Supplementary Figure S5) is not able to remove the GC
content effect for all the three HTS platforms, while it performs
very well in mitigating the mappability bias also in the case of
the SOLiD platform where the mappability effect is very strong
(see Figure 4e, j and o and Supplementary Fig. S6). The GC
content normalization approach proposed by Yoon et (11 . (2009) (see
Figure 3b, e and h and Supplementary Fig. S5) is able to properly
remove the GC content effect for all the three HTS platforms.
The comparison between the other three mappability normalization
methods Clearly show that the approaches proposed by Miller et (11.
(2011) (see Figure 40, h and m and Supplementary Fig. S6) and
Ivakhno et (11. (2010) (see Figure 4d, i and n and Supplementary
Fig. S4) are not able to completely correct the non-linear bias
produced by genomic regions with low mappability. These analyses
also demonstrate that the approach introduced by Miller et (11.
(2011) generates additional biases and has the disadvantage that
much data are discarded since RCs with extremely low mappability
(< 25%) are ﬁltered out to prevent overcorrection. The additional
bias generated by the Miller et (11. (2011) method is due to the
assumption that RC is proportional to the percent of mappability:
multiplying RC data by the inverse of percent mappability leads to
overcorrection. Conversely, the mappability normalization scheme
proposed in this article (Figure 4b, g and l and Supplementary
Fig. S6) allows to correct this bias without ﬁltering out RC data.
Moreover, also in the case of the highly biased SOLiD data the
median method permits correction of RC mean value. The results
of all these analyses indicate that the normalization method by
Yoon et (11. (2009) and the median method are the best strategies to
remove GC content and mappability biases, respectively. Moreover,

also when we need to compare the copy number alteration of two
samples by means of a ratio approach (for example tumour DNA
and its paired normal DNA), it is recommended to correct data with
the Yoon et (11. normalization scheme and the median mappability
scheme.

3.4 CNV regions identiﬁcation

To test the ability of different algorithms in detecting CNVs of
different size, we made an intensive simulation based on synthetic
chromosomes generated from RCs of the individuals NA12878 and
NA19240 for high coverage sequencing data and the individuals
NA11840, NA11830 and NA12043 for low coverage sequencing
data. The principal aim of these simulations is to evaluate and
compare the capability of each algorithm in detecting sudden shifts
in the mean value of the signal as a ﬁinction of the width of
the shift. For this purpose, we have built a benchmark synthetic
dataset generated by using GC- and mappability-adjusted RC

data with the same normalization scheme: GC correction was
performed by means of the Yoon et (11. (2009) normalization
scheme, while the mappability bias was corrected by means of
the median normalization scheme. Each synthetic chromosome was
generated by sampling RC data windows from genomic regions
previously predicted as two-copy and one-copy by McCarroll et (11.
(2008) to simulate both normal copy count and altered regions
(see Supplementary Material for more details). We compared the
performance of the six algorithms described in Section 2: two
sliding window methods (CNVseq, EWT) and four segmentation
algorithms (CBS, SLM, MSB and the HMM of CNASeg). To
evaluate the performance of the six algorithms, we used two different
strategies. To test the capability of each algorithm in discovering
CNVs, we used the approach previously used by Yoon et (11. (2009)
and Magi et (11. (2011): a detected segment is considered a true
positive (TP) if there is any overlap between the detected segment
and the synthetic altered region, and is considered a false positive
(FP) if there is no overlap with a synthetic altered region. To
understand the accuracy of the six methods in detecting CNVs at
the boundaries (breakpoints detection), we computed the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve as in Lai et (11. (2010) and
we calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results of
all the simulations are summarized in Figure 5 and Supplementary
Figure S7—S38. Globally, the algorithms that ensure the best results
in terms of both sensitivity and speciﬁcity are the EWT and the
SLM methods. The CBS and MSB algorithms obtain good results in
detecting alterations made of a large number of windows (N = 50 and
N = 100), while their performance reduces for alterations made of a
small number of windows (N = 5 and N = 10). The HMM algorithm
of the CNASeg package performs well on RCs generated from high
coverage sequencing data while leads to modest results for low
coverage data. The CNVseq method gives poor results for both high
and low coverage data with all the bin size we simulated. The CNVs
detection analyses (Supplementary Figures S31—S38) show that for
high coverage data from GA platform the EWT and SLM algorithms
are able to detect genomic alterations as small as 500 bp and 1 kb,
respectively, with a TPR >08 and with a minor number FP events.
On the same data, the CBS, MSB and CNASeg methods enable the
detection of CNVs as small as 2—5 kb with a TPR >08 and small
number of FF events. For low coverage data (Illumina GA platform),
the EWT and SLM methods are able to discover genomic alterations
as small as 5 kb, while CBS, MSB and CNASeg detect CNVs as
small as 25 kb. The CNVseq algorithm identiﬁes a very large number
of FF events for both high and low coverage sequencing data making
its use difﬁcult for the detection of genomic regions involved in
CNVs. The ROC curves reported in Supplementary Figures S11—
S30 show that segmentation algorithms (SLM, CBS, MSB and the
HMM of CNASeg) have low FPR at the expense of low TPR, while
smoothing algorithms (EWT and CNVseq) have high TPR at the
expense of high FPR. Moreover, as reported in Lai et (11. (2010),
ROC curves are informative in understanding how an algorithm
performs in estimating the boundary of the altered region. When the
algorithm over-estimates the boundary, FPR increases while TPR
remains ﬁxed. Conversely, when an algorithm under-estimates the
boundary, TPR decreases while FPR remains ﬁxed. Bearing this in
mind, the ROC curves reported in Supplementary Figures S11—S30
suggest that segmentation methods (SLM, CBS, MSB and the HMM
of CNASeg) tend to under-estimate the boundaries of CNV, while
the EWT algorithm tend to over-estimate the boundaries of the CNV

the analysis of synthetic chromosomes. Synthetic chromosomes are obtained from high and low coverage sequencing data of the three HTS platforms for

simulations. Each bar of the plot is obtained averaging the performance of each algorithm for all the alteration widths simulated (N :5, N: 10, N :20,

bin sizes we studied. Moreover, we found that the detection of DNA
alterations in samples with low sequencing coverage is identical to
analysing samples with high sequencing coverage if a bin size is
larger. In particular, we found that the Illumina platform obtains
high accuracy for bin size W = 100 bp at high coverage and W =
500 bp at low coverage, while the 454 and SOLiD platforms give
good results for bin size W = 500 bp for high coverage and W =
1000 bp for low coverage.

3.5 Copy number estimation

To study the relationship between DNA copy number and RCs data,
we examined several broad genomic regions that were previously
reported to have copy numbers equal to 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 by
McCarroll et (11. (2008) (Supplementary Material). We analysed
RC data of these regions for different window sizes for the high
and low coverage sequencing data generated with the three HTS
platforms. The results of all these analyses are reported in Figure 6
(high coverage data) and Supplementary Figure S11 (low coverage
data) and clearly reﬂect the overdispersion of the RC distributions
generated by the three sequencing technologies. For GA and 454
platforms, we observed an excellent agreement between mean RCs
and DNA copy number for high coverage data for all the bin sizes we
analysed, while for SOLiD platform we found that RC are not well
correlated with validated DNA copy number. For low coverage data,
we found a smaller correlation coefﬁcient for all the HTS platforms.
However, also in this case GA and 454 technologies better predict
the absolute value of DNA copy number.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The use of RC of sequences aligned to a reference genome is, at
present, the most powerﬁil method to accurately predict absolute
copy numbers of genomic regions. Although this computational
strategy has been recently introduced in literature, much work has
been already done for the preparation, normalization and analysis of
this kind of data. Normalization methods allow to remove systematic
biases due to local GC content and region mappability: the results
reported here clearly show that the best way to remove local GC
content bias is the Yoon et (11. approach, while the best scheme
to correct mappability bias is the median method proposed in the
present article. CNVs detection algorithms can be exploited to
detect CNVs with an unprecedented resolution that in the best case
reaches the order of hundreds of base pair. In all the simulations,
we performed we found that the EWT and SLM algorithms give the
best results in terms of both sensitivity and speciﬁcity. The resolution
of CNV detection can be improved by increasing the SNR of RC
signals: reducing the sequencing error rate or increasing the coverage
of the sequencing experiments will improve the performance of
statistical methods in detecting small shifts in the signals. Automatic
strategies for bin size calculation fail in estimating the optimal bin
size whatever the coverage. Although the method proposed by Miller
et (11. models RC data by means of a negative binomial distribution,
it overestimates the bin size leading to a loss of resolution accuracy.
After an intensive simulation on synthetic data, we found that the
best way to choose the optimal bin size is following the suggestion
of Abyzov et (11.: 100bp window for 20—30>< coverage, 500bp
window for 4—6>< coverage and 50 bp window for 100>< coverage.
The comparison between the three HTS platforms clearly shows

that the Illumina platform allow to obtain the best level of accuracy
and resolution in the discovery of genomic regions involved in
CNV and the prediction of absolute DNA copy number. Although
RC approach is the only sequencing-based method to accurately
predict absolute DNA copy numbers, it has distinct advantages and
disadvantages over other approaches in detecting certain classes
of SVs and the breakpoint resolution is often poor with respect
to other sequencing-based methods. The analyses employed with
different approaches [PEM, SR (Mills et (11., 2006) and RC] on the
same data in the framework of the 1000 Genomes Project show
that RC-based approach can better ascertain CNVs in segmental
duplication than PEM-based methods. Conversely, RC methods
mostly miss CNVs consisting entirely of a single retrotransposon
(LINE, SVA or HERV—K) that are easily detected by PEM and
SR approaches. Additionally, RC analysis is not able to detect
balanced rearrangements that can be instead discovered by PEM
and split read methods. The comparison with the CNVs identiﬁed
by microarray technologies shows that the great majority of the
calls overlapped between the two methods (Alkan et (11., 2011;
Magi et (11., 2011; Yoon et (11., 2009). Despite the great overlap

between RC and microarray calls, RC is better than microarray at
detecting smaller events and does not suffer from oversaturation
at high copy counts, allowing a more accurate estimation of very
high copy counts. While the sections discussed above describe the
great progress achieved over the last 3 years in using RC data to
discover CNVs, much work remains. When RC data are used to
analyse tumour samples, statistical approach to infer copy number
should take into account cellularity and tumoural heterogeneity and
for this reason we would need a more sophisticated approach similar
to CGHcall (van de Wiel et (11., 2007) or FastCall (Benelli et (11.,
2010) instead of using the simple rounding to the closest integer.
Finally, the breakpoint resolution of RC methods is often poor
with respect to other sequencing-based approaches. However, given
the approximate CNV breakpoint detected by an RC approach, the
detection precision can be brought to 1 base resolution by reﬁning
the breakpoint by means of SRs techniques. The ultimate way to
accurately detect all forms of genomic structural variants is de
novo assembly (Levy et (11., 2010; Li et (11., 2011). Nevertheless,
assembly approaches are still in their early stages and are capable
to type structural variants only if the sequence reads are long and
accurate enough to allow de novo assembly. Moreover, assembly
algorithms have been shown to collapse in highly repeated and
highly duplicated genomic regions (Alkan et (11., 2011). Albeit
assembly approaches show a lot of potential (facilitating the pair-
wise genome comparison) their application as routine methods
still need further efforts, in both computational and technological
developments.

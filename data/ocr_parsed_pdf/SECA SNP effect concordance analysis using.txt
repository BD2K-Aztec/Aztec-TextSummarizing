SECA

 

that has not already been clumped (denoting this as the index SNP) and
forms clumps of all other SNPs that are within 1 Mb and in LD (r2> 0.1)
with the index SNP based on HapMap or 1000 Genomes Project (1 kGP)
genotype data. A second round of LD clumping is performed to ensure
none of the round 1 index SNPs within 10Mb of each other are in long-
range LD (r2 > 0.1). The default approach identiﬁes the subset of inde-
pendent SNPs with the most signiﬁcant association P-values in dataset].
An alternate LD clumping approach identiﬁes an effectively random
subset of independent SNPs by setting all dataset] P-values (P,) to 0.5
during the clumping rounds.

Restricting to SNPs associated with P, 5 {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} in dataset], SECA ﬁrst performs exact binomial
statistical tests using the R statistical package (R Development Core
Team, 2009) to determine whether there is an excess of SNPs associated
in both datasets for the subset of SNPs associated with P2: {0.01, 0.05,
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} in datasetZ. For each of the 144
SNP subsets (generated using these 12 X 12 P-value threshold combin-
ations), binomial tests of associated SNPs in dataset] (P,) and dataset2
(P2) are performed. A binomial test ‘heatmap’ plot is generated to graph-
ically summarize the proportion of SNP subsets with an excess [observed
(obs) : expected (exp)] or deﬁcit (obs<exp) number of associated SNPs,
and empirical P-values (adjusted for testing all 144 subsets) are calculated
via permutation. The permutation procedure ﬁrst creates uncorrelated
datasets by randomly shufﬂing the observed SNP effect (BETA) and
corresponding P-value (P) between SNPs in dataset], and then repeats
the analysis of the 144 SNP subsets. A permuted P-value (PBTs,g_pe,mu,ed)
is estimated for the observed number of binomial tests with obs : exp and
PBT50.05 (ang), and for the single most signiﬁcant excess (PBTm,n_
Ipelmum). We note that for polygenic traits, a well-powered GWAS
should produce an excess of smaller P-values (Yang et al., 2011).
Therefore, instead of specifying P2 as the expected proportion of SNPs
with P, and P2, the proportion of SNPs associated in dataset2 (irrespect-
ive of its P-value in dataset]) is used as the ‘overlap’ (null) probability (i.e.
‘expected proportion’) in the binomial tests. For example, the observed
proportion of total SNPs with P, 5 1 and P250.05 is used as the ex-
pected proportion of SNPs with P, 5 {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} and P25 0.05.

SECA next performs Fisher’s exact statistical tests to determine
whether there is an excess of SNPs where the effect directions (BETA,
OR or ZSCORE) are concordant across dataset] and dataset2 for each of
the 144 SNP subsets. Fisher’s exact tests of SNP effects in dataset] (e.g.
OR,) and dataset2 (OR2) are performed on 2 X 2 tables containing the
number of SNPs with OR, <1 (BETA,/ZSCORE, <0) and OR2< 1,
OR, :1 (BETA,/ZSCORE, : 0) and OR2< 1, OR, <1 and OR2 :1
and OR, :1 and 0R2: 1. A Fisher’s test ‘heatmap’ plot is generated
to graphically summarize the proportion of SNP subsets with concordant
(Fisher’s test odds ratio, ORFT: 1) and discordant (ORFT< 1) SNP ef-
fects, and an empirical P-value (PFTs,g_pe,muwd) is calculated via permu-
tation for the observed number of subsets (nFTs,g) with nominally
signiﬁcant concordance (ORFT : 1 and PF, 5 0.05). A permuted P-
value is also estimated for the single most signiﬁcant concordant test
(PFTmin-permuted)-

In addition to a summary of the above analyses, SECA reports de-
tailed results from binomial and Fisher’s tests for three practical subsets
of SNPs, which are nominally associated (P2 5 0.05) in dataset2 and (i)
genome-wide signiﬁcant (P, 5 5 X 1078), (ii) genome-wide suggestive
(P, 5 1 X 1075) and (iii) nominally associated (P, 5 0.05) in dataset].

A ‘grid’ search is also performed across 150 P-value thresholds to
identify the subset of SNPs overlapping dataset] and dataset2 that pro-
duce the minimum binomial test ‘pleiotropic’ P-value and minimum
Fisher’s test (effect concordance) P-value. The search is performed at 5
equidistant P-value {P,, P2} increments for the interval [5 X 1078,
9 X1078], i.e. {5 X1078, 6 X1078, 7 X1078, 8 X 10*, 9 X1078}; 9 equi-
distant increments for each of the intervals [1 X 1077, 9 X 1077], [1 X 1076,

9 X1076], [1 X 10’5, 9 X1075], [1 X 104‘, 9 X107], [1 X1073, 9 X1073];
and 100 increments of 0.01 between 0.01 and 1.0. The results from all
150 X 150 :22 500 SNP subsets are output to enable post hoc examin-
ation of SNP overlap and concordance across the full range of statistical
signiﬁcance in dataset] and dataset2.

Additionally, SECA generates quantileiquantile (Q-Q) and true dis-
covery rate (TDR) plots for dataset2 P-values (P2) stratiﬁed (conditioned)
on dataset] P-values (P, 5 {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}) to visualize
whether there is an excess of overlapping ‘pleiotropic’ SNPs. A leftward
shift in the Q-Q or TDR curve corresponds to an excess of SNPs with
smaller P-values. In the presence of pleiotropy, we expect the Q-Q and
TDR curves for dataset2 SNP P-values (P2) to deviate further left of the
identity line because we condition on them having smaller P-values (P,)
in dataset]. Finally, ‘pleiotropy-informed’ conditional false discover rate
(FDR) results are output for dataset2 P-values (P2) stratiﬁed on dataset]
P-values (P, 5 {1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01,
0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001}). These results may identify SNPs associated in
dataset2 after conditioning on their association signiﬁcance (P,) in data-
set] and help prioritize SNPs for follow-up studies. Coincidently,
Andreassen et a]. (2013) developed in parallel (but without accompanying
software), similar Q-Q and TDR plot and FDR-based approaches to
identify pleiotropic effects. An overview of the SECA approach is pro-
vided in Supplementary Figure S2.

Resources to customize LD clumping, an alternate version of SECA
(iSECA), which assumes the SNPs in dataset] to be independent, and an
R script allowing users to alter the number of replicates (default: 1000)
for the permutation of binomial and Fisher’s test P-values are also
provided.

3 RESULTS

Using publicly available GWAS summary data, SECA corrob—
orates recent results from the Cross—Disorder Group of the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (Smoller et al., 2013), ﬁnding
signiﬁcant polygenic overlap between bipolar disorder, major
depressive disorder, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder,
but generally not with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(further details and results are provided in the Supplementary
Material).

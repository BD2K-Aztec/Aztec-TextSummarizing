Abstract

Purpose: PaxtoolsR package enables access to pathway data represented in the BioPAX format
and made available through the Pathway Commons webservice for users of the R language to aid
in advanced pathway analyses. Features include the extraction, merging and validation of pathway
data represented in the BioPAX format. This package also provides novel pathway datasets and
advanced querying features for R users through the Pathway Commons webservice allowing users
to query, extract and retrieve data and integrate these data with local BioPAX datasets.

Availability and implementation: The PaxtoolsR package is compatible with versions of R 3.1.1
(and higher) on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux using Bioconductor 3.0 and is available through the
Bioconductor R package repository along with source code and a tutorial vignette describing com—
mon tasks, such as data visualization and gene set enrichment analysis. Source code and docu—
mentation are at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/paxtoolsr. This plugin is free, open—source

 

and licensed underthe LGPL—3.

1 Introduction

The amount of biological pathway data in machine—readable databases
and formats continues to increase. Pathway analysis allows researchers
to gain new understanding of the functions of biological systems. A
common task has been to aggregate pathway data across databases.
This task has been simplified through the creation of standardized data
representations, such as the Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX)
format (Demir et (11., 2010). Pathway Commons is an ongoing effort to
aggregate pathway data over a number of databases supporting the
BioPAX notation and webservices to access these data (Cerami et (11.,
2011). The core component that facilitates the development of projects
using data in the BioPAX format, such as Pathway Commons, has
been Paxtools, a BioPAX application programming interface (API)
written in Java (Demir et (11., 2013).

Although the R programming language is widely used in areas of
computational biology, there is a deficiency in the availability of path—
way data provided through R packages. A recent review by Kramer
et al. (2013, 2014) describes 12 R packages for working with pathway

data. The majority of these packages—including KEGGgraph,
PathView and ReactomePA—utilizes and provides data from KEGG
and Reactome. A number of the packages are generic parsers for a var—
iety of formats, including the Systems Biology Markup Language
(SBML), KEGG Markup Language (KGML) and BioPAX.

Through the PaxtoolsR package, we extend the literature—cura—
ted pathway data available to R users, we provide a number of
Paxtools API functions, and provide an interface to the Pathway
Commons webservice. Through this interface, PaxtoolsR provides
native support for the aggregated Pathway Commons database,
including data imported from the NCI Pathway Interaction
Database (PID), PantherDB, HumanCyc, Reactome, PhoshoSitePlus
and HPRD.

2 Implementation and functionality

PaxtoolsR is implemented using the rJava R package (http://www.
rforge.net/r]ava/) which allows R code to call Java methods.

Although R users could use rJava to directly call methods in the
Paxtools library, these tend not to follow typical R language conven—
tions, and therefore, PaxtoolsR simplifies the usage of Paxtools in
R. PaxtoolsR implements two main sets of features: (i) functions
available through the Paxtools console application and (ii) functions
available provided through the Pathway Commons webservice.
Below, we first describe the main data formats used by the
PaxtoolsR package and then describe the functions provided
by PaxtoolsR. Additionally, the PaxtoolsR provides a vignette
(found on the project website) to guide users in using the provided
functionality, such as the visualization of networks directly in
R using existing R graph libraries, such as igraph (Csardi and
Nepusz, 2006) and RCytoscape (Shannon et (11., 2013), and combin—
ing the analysis of gene expression microarrays with pathway
data using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et (11.,
2005).

2.1 Data formats

There are several primary data formats used by the PaxtoolsR pack—
age: BioPAX, simple interaction format (SIF) and extensible markup
language (XML); here we describe the role of each of these formats
in the PaxtoolsR package.

2.1.1 BioPAX format

The BioPAX format is an RDF/OWL—based language described pre—
viously and used as the main input format for the functions provided
via the Paxtools Java library (Demir et (11., 2010, 2013). BioPAX
representations for databases aggregated by Pathway Commons can
be downloaded from the project website (http://www.pathwaycom
mons.org). The currently aggregated databases, include HPRD,
HumanCyc, NCI PID, Panther, PhosphoSitePlus and Reactome,
among others.

2.1.2 Simple Interaction Format (SIF)

The SIP format is a tab—delimited, plain—text network edge list
that describes how two molecules are related in a binary fashion,
and is generated from BioPAX datasets by searching certain graph—
ical patterns (Babur et (11., 2014). The SIF format composed of
three columns: PARTICIPANT A, INTERACTION TYPE and
PARTICIPANT B. There are a number of interaction types, which
are described in the package vignette. The conversion from BioPAX
to SIF is lossy, but remains useful for applications that require bin—
ary interactions, which includes many existing network analysis
software tools.

2.1.3 Extensible markup language

BioPAX file validation and search results of Pathway Commons results
are returned as R XML (http://www.omegahat.org/RSXML/) objects
where further data can be extracted using XPath expressions in R.

2.2 Convert, merge and validate local BioPAX files

A number of BioPAX—related functions are available in PaxtoolsR.
These functions can both operate on local BioPAX files and those
retrieved from Pathway Commons. PaxtoolsR provides a program—
ming interface for the BioPAX format and for the functions pro—
vided through the Paxtools console application. These functions
allow importing data into R through the SIF format and conversion
of BioPAX files into a variety of formats, including the GSEA gene
set format. Functions are also provided to extract subnetvvorks from
BioPAX files and the merging of multiple BioPAX files through a
previously described method that merges equivalent elements

 

Fig. 1. Pathway Commons graph query of interactions between AKT1 and
MTOR using PaxtoolsR and visualized using igraph. Data for the figure were
retrieved with the command: graphPc (source:c (“AKT1”, " IRSl",
"MTOR", IGFlR"), kind:“PATHSBETWEEN", format:“BINARY_SIF")

(Demir, 2013; Demir et (11., 2013). Additionally, PaxtoolsR provides
methods to summarize the usage of BioPAX classes and validate
BioPAX datasets (Rodchenkov et (11., 2013).

2.3 Query and traverse data from pathway commons
PaxtoolsR provides a number of functions for interacting with the
Pathway Commons webservice. PaxtoolsR allows users to query
Pathway Commons data via two functions. The first involves search—
ing for specific molecular species or pathways of interest, using the
searchPc() function. The second is the graphPc() function, which
allows users to query subnetvvorks of interest. Figure 1 shows the
usage of the graphPc() command to extract a small subnetvvork
involving the kinases AKT1 and MTOR. This subnetvvork is then
converted to a binary SIF network and visualized using igraph in R;
this showcases how Pathway Commons data can be easily visualized
using existing R packages. The traverse() function allows the extrac—
tion of specific entries from BioPAX records, such as the phosphoryl—
ation site information from proteins described in a BioPAX dataset.

3 Conclusion

The PaxtoolsR package extends the available biological pathway
data available to researchers working primarily in an R environ—
ment. This package makes many of the features available from the
BioPAX Paxtools API and the Pathway Commons webservice. The
data and functionality provided here can be used for a wide range of
biological pathway analysis studies and can be easily integrated with
the rich ecosystem of existing R packages. Future development of
this R package is expected as additions are made to the underlying
Paxtools Java library and Pathway Commons webservice.
Furthermore, we invite developers of network analysis R packages
interested in the Pathway Commons data to work with us to help
make the data we provide available to their methodologies.

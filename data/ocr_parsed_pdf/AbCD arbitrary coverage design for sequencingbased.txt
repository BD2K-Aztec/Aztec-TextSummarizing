ABSTRACT

Summary: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have revolu-
tionized genetic studies. Although high-coverage sequencing can un-
cover most variants present in the sequenced sample, low-coverage
sequencing is appealing for its cost effectiveness. Here, we present
AbCD (arbitrary coverage design) to aid the design of sequencing-
based studies. AbCD is a user-friendly interface providing
pre—estimated effective sample sizes, specific to each minor allele fre-
quency category, for designs with arbitrary coverage (0.5—30x) and
sample size (20—10000), and for four major ethnic groups (Europeans,
Africans, Asians and African Americans). In addition, we also present
two software tools: ShotGun and DesignPlanner, which were used to
generate the estimates behind AbCD. ShotGun is a flexible short-read
simulator for arbitrary user-specified read length and average depth,
allowing cycle-speciﬁc sequencing error rates and realistic read depth
distributions. DesignPlanner is a full pipeline that uses ShotGun to
generate sequence data and performs initial SNP discovery, uses
our previously presented linkage disequilibrium-aware method to call
genotypes, and, finally, provides minor allele frequency-specific effect-
ive sample sizes. ShotGun plus DesignPlanner can accommodate
effective sample size estimate for any combination of high-depth
and low-depth data (for example, whole-genome low-depth plus
exonic high-depth) or combination of sequence and genotype data
[for example, whole-exome sequencing plus genotyping from existing
Genomewide Association Study (GWAS)].

Availability and implementation: AbCD, including its downloadable
terminal interface and web-based interface, and the associated tools
ShotGun and DesignPlanner, including documentation, examples and
executables, are available at http://www.unc.edu/~yunmli/AbCD.html.

1 INTRODUCTION

Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies have trans-
formed the ﬁeld of genomic studies (Ansorge, 2009; Mardis,
2008; Metzker, 2010). High-coverage sequencing, which is able

to detect essentially every variant present in the sequenced indi-
viduals (Coventry et al., 2010; Nelson et al., 2012), has been
successful for the identiﬁcation of genetic variants causing
Mendelian diseases (Bamshad et al., 2011; Ionita—Laza et al.,
2011; Ng et al., 2010), but it remains cost prohibitive for large
samples required for the study of complex traits. Recent studies
(Flannick et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011; Pasaniuc et al., 2012) have
proposed low-coverage sequencing as a powerful alternative.
However, there are no resources or software tools that directly
evaluate the statistical power of an arbitrary coverage
sequencing-based design to quantitatively guide the design deci-
sions. Here, we present AbCD (arbitrary coverage design), a
user-friendly interface with pre-estimated minor allele frequency
(MAF) and ethnicity-speciﬁc effective sample sizesiwhich is
directly associated with power of subsequent association studies
(Pritchard and Przeworski, 2001%for a wide range of
sequencing-based designs with average sequencing depth ranging
from 0.5 to 30x and sample size ranging from 20 to 10000. In
addition, we present ShotGun and DesignPlanner, two software
tools that generate the effective sample size estimates behind
AbCD. We anticipate AbCD and the two associated tools will
greatly facilitate the design of sequencing-based studies.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 AbCD

AbCD has four major features. First, it allows arbitrary coverage
sequencing with average coverage/depth (d) ranging from 0.5 to
30x, so that low-, median- and high-coverage sequencing design
can be evaluated. Second, AbCD includes a wide range of
sequenced sample sizes (11), from 20 to 10000. We have estimated
the MAF-speciﬁc effective sample sizes using actual simulations
when the number of sequenced individuals (n) takes the following
15 values: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2000,
4000, 6000, 8000 and 10000. Simulations involved generation of
chromosomes using cosi (Schaffner et al., 2005) that mimics real-
istic linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and demographic his-
tories consistent with real data, generation of short-read
sequence data and initial SNP discovery through ShotGun
from the simulated chromosomes and ﬁnal LD-based variant
calling and effective sample size estimation using thunder

(Li et al., 2011). Results were averages from 10 regions simulated
from the cosi calibrated distributions (see the Simulations Details
tab on our website for details). We have previously used the same
simulation procedure and found it generates effective sample size
estimates close to estimates from real data (Li et al., 2010, 2011).
Third, AbCD considers four major ethnic groupsiEuropeans,
Africans, Asians and African Americansiso that multi-ethnic
study design can also be accommodated. Finally, AbCD is user-
friendly, and it functions through simple mouse clicking.
Needless to say, it is fast because no calculation except interpol-
ation for sample sizes not covered (integers between 20 and
10000, but not among the 15 values aforementioned) is needed.

Figure 1 shows the interface of our downloadable AbCD
(our web-based interface is similar), displaying results for the
design with n = 85 (note that it is not one of the 15 values directly
evaluated through actual simulations), d: 2 and ethnicity: EU
(Europeans). We can see that rarer variants are more challenging
for detection. For example, this particular design can only detect
17.68% rare variants with MAF 0.&1%, but it can discover
essentially all (99.35%) common variants with MAF of >5%.
Note that the detection power is upper bounded by the per-
centage of variants in the MAF category that segregate
(i.e. polymorphic) among the sequenced samples, which are
83.94% (392/467) and 100%, respectively. In addition, informa-
tion content as measured by r2 and effective sample size (nr2)
also tends to decrease with decreasing MAF. For example,
although 85 individuals are sequenced in this design, the effective
sample size is only 46 for the 17.68% discovered rare variants
with MAF of 0.&1%, but it is much higher (75) close to
the sequenced sample size 85 for common variants with MAF
of >5%.

2.2 ShotGun and DesignPlanner

ShotGun is a short-read simulator that can (i) allow cycle-speciﬁc
sequencing error rates. It is known that MPS data quality deteri-
orates with the biochemical reactions, such that nucleotides
called from cycles towards the end are usually of inferior quality
(Bansal et al., 2010). Therefore, it is important to allow
cycle-speciﬁc error rates to reﬂect this feature; (ii) handle over
dispersed read depth distribution. Ideally, the read depths follow a
Poisson distribution when the starting positions of sequence

reads follow a discrete uniform distribution in the targeted
region. However, stochastic and experimental limitations result
in over dispersed read depths across bases. Following the study
conducted by Sampson et al. (2011), we use a Gamma mixture of
Poisson’s to account for the overdispersion. The level of overdis-
persion is controlled by a shape parameter that can be speciﬁed
by the user; (iii) control false-positive rate. When simulating a
large number of individuals in a long region, it is desirable to
filter out base pairs that are unlikely to be polymorphic. We
apply a multi-sample single-site statistic Zi[MI,(MI,+ 1)],
where the sum is over all individuals, and MI,- is the minor
allele count of the ith individual (Li et al., 2010). We use simu-
lations to determine the empirical threshold for this statistic at
any user-speciﬁed false-positive rate and ﬁlter out bases unlikely
to be polymorphic accordingly.

DesignPlanner is a full pipeline from sequencing data simu-
lation using ShotGun, to LD-based genotype calling, to effective
sample size estimation in different MAF categories in
DesignPlanner and to facilitate the design of MPS-based studies
not covered in AbCD.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We present AbCD and two associated software tools (ShotGun
and DesignPlanner) to facilitate the design of arbitrary coverage
sequencing-based studies. Our software, tutorial and simulated

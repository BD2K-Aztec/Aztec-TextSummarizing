a user—friendly, interactive web—based interface with configurable features to generate Circos circu—
lar plots.

Availability and implementation: Online web—service is freely available at http://clicofs.codoncloud.

1 Introduction

Circos (Krzywinski et (11., 2009) is a Perl language—based tool to rep—
resent visual data in a circular form. The native Circos software is
provided through a command—line interface (CLI). Installation and
configuration of the software, though not difficult for users with
command line experience, pose a certain degree of difficulty to those
who are not familiar with the CLI.

There are other alternatives to Circos that enable plotting of circu—
lar images, which including Circoletto, CIRCUS and RCircos
(Darzentas, 2010; Naquin et (11., 2014; Zhang et (11., 2013). Circoletto
and CIRCUS have been developed for more specialised functions. The
former integrates Basic Local Alignment Search Tool or BLAST
(Altschul et (11., 1990) results and the Circos plot via a web—based user
interface (UI), whereas the latter specializes in plotting structure vari—
ants of genomes. They are not ﬂexible in generating plots with differ—
ent data types. On the other hand, RCircos supports Circos data track
plotting, but it is based on the R—package CLI.

Some of the applications above require setup, configuration and
coding skills in order to fully utilize the applications. Users with
little or no experience in the CLI environment could encounter a
demanding learning curve. To address the issue, ClicO FS

(Open Circular Layout Interactive Converter) is developed. ClicO
FS is a user—friendly web service which allows users to generate
Circos plots easily. Not all functions of Circos can be done by ClicO
FS, such as chromosome axis breaks.

2 Methods

ClicO FS is built using Ruby on Rails as the back—end technology,
and Twitter Bootstrap as the front—end framework. ClicO FS re—
ceives the required files through user upload. Three types of files are
required by Circos, namely (i) karyotype, (ii) data and (iii) configur—
ation files, while ClicO FS requires only the first two file types. The
karyotype file defines the axes, which are typically chromosomes, se—
quence contigs, or clones in the biological context. It is a 7—column
format file containing information for each axis, including unique
identifier, label, size and color. The data files are another input files
from which to draw various types of data. Data types currently sup—
ported by ClicO FS includes links, histograms, line plots, scatter
plots, heatmaps, tiles, texts, connectors and highlights. The data file
formats are simple, generally involving three to seven columns de—
pending on the data track to be drawn. Detailed descriptions on the

Fig. 1. ClicO FS Plots. Re-produced circular plots based on publication by
Love at al. (2012) (A) Comparative genomics of human and mouse using
simulated data show that ClicO FS is capable to generate various data types
including tiles, histogram, line plot, heatmap, scatter plot, text, connector,
links and highlight plots (B). Circular plots of Escherichia coli O157:H7 gen-
ome (C). The tracks from outer to inner rings after the scale (in Mb) represent
chromosome, forward genes, reverse genes, tRNA, rRNA, GC plot and GC
skew

file formats are specified on the ClicO FS interface. All files accepted
by ClicO F5 are of the same format as Circos to facilitate ease the
use when switching between the two programmes.

ClicO FS does not require users to upload configuration files. All
configurations can be set in the user interface. As ClicO FS is de—
signed with user—friendliness as a priority, default parameters that
are not configurable are given to some less commonly used settings.
However, advanced users are allowed to input more configurations
like backgrounds, rules, axes, label snuggling and highlights, in a
special text box in ClicO FS.

Some additional functions are provided, such as the assignment
of various color schemes to karyotypes. Besides, users can preview
the output at any time while testing the configurations, without sav—
ing them.

Registered ClicO FS users can create multiple independent pro—
jects. All associated data and configurations are stored in databases
dedicated to the respective projects. Thus, users can retrieve or con—
tinue to work on the project the next time they log in.

In addition to that, ClicO FS provides a pre—configured, template—
based approach that can speed up the generation of some common
forms of presentation. For instance, GenBank database is one of the
most common sources of sequence data. Users can upload GenBank
format files to ClicO FS. With just five clicks, information like genes,
GC contents and structural RNAs of that genome can be visualized.

Functionality of Circos is diverse and dynamic. To expand the
functionality of ClicO F5 in line with that of Circos. To address this
issue, users of ClicO F5 are allowed to download all configuration
and data files of the project that they creat. These files can be used
as a template, to add elements not supported by ClicO FS, and run
using Circos from a terminal.

3 Results

To demonstrate the capability of ClicO F5 to generate Circos images
without CLI interaction, attempts were made to reproduce relevant
published images using ClicO FS. A randomly selected publication
with different data types, including links and scatter plots was
chosen (Love et al., 2012). Data was extracted from the published
paper, and was converted according to the ClicO FS input format.
Then ensuing reproduced plot is similar to the original Circos plot
from the paper (Fig. 1A and Supplement Data) with the pattern and
the meaning of the data preserved.

In addition, simulated data was generated to plot human and
mouse genomes with ClicO FS. Figure 1B shows that ClicO FS is
able to generate links, histogram, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap,
tiles, text, connector and highlight. Moreover, background color,
axes and rules were applied on histogram successfully using the
advanced text box.

To test the template—based plotting function of ClicO FS, a ran—
domly selected genbank file of a bacterium genome Escherichia coli
O157:H7 (NC_002695) was used. Information on the genome
including genes, GC plots, and structural RNAs was successfully
plotted by ClicO FS (Fig. 1C).

4 Conclusions and outlook

ClicO FS was developed to provide a user friendly interface to
Circos. It allows researchers to access the powerful Circos applica—
tion while reducing the complexity required in setting up the appli—
cation as well as reducing the time required to generate a Circos
plot. ClicO FS provides an easy—to—understand workﬂow with step

by step guide for the users to input their data and configure the
image output. Currently, ClicO FS is being improved to support
some specific applications such as plotting BLAST data for com—
parative genomics, genetic linkage map data and transcriptome ana—
lysis data. These applications will be developed as plugins to
simplify the process of generating circular image. We will continue
to develop ClicO FS to provide more features and support to the re—
search community.

Fig. l. DEsubs overview. (A) User inputs the RNA—seq control—case expression dataset and selects the organism. the gene label system and the pathway type and subse-
quently the appropriate pathway network is constructed. (B) The pathway network processing is based on two pruning rules by retaining the statistically significant DEGs

'odeRule) and interactions which are in accordance with the ﬂow of information imposed by KEGG pathway maps (EdgeRule). Pruning rules are applied through several
user-defined DE tools and correlation measures. (C) Subpathways are extracted from the processed pathway network based on a broad range of sub-structures. resulting in
124 extraction types in total. (D) A hypergeometric test is used to estimate the subpathway‘s associations with various b ogical and plmrmacological features. (E) The
enriched associations of a subpathway to each feature are illustrated using several visualization schemes. Furthermore. by zooming in and out of subpathways. DEsubs pro-

vides a customized view of the resulting subpathways from the gene up to organism level. Heat maps. circular diagrams. dot plots. bar plots and graph plots are supported.

Abstract

Motivation: The three—dimensional (3D) conformation of chromosomes and genomes play an
important role in cellular processes such as gene regulation, DNA replication and genome methyla—
tion. Several methods have been developed to reconstruct 3D structures of individual chromo—
somes from chromosomal conformation capturing data such as Hi—C data. However, few methods
can effectively reconstruct the 3D structures of an entire genome due to the difficulty of handling
noisy and inconsistent inter—chromosomal contact data.

Results: We generalized a 3D chromosome reconstruction method to make it capable of recon—
structing 3D models of genomes from both intra— and inter—chromosomal Hi—C contact data and im—
plemented it as a software tool called MOGEN. We validated MOGEN on synthetic datasets of a
polymer worm—like chain model and a yeast genome at first, and then applied it to generate an en—
semble of 3D structural models of the genome of human B—cells from a Hi—C dataset. These gen—
ome models not only were validated by some known structural patterns of the human genome,
such as chromosome compartmentalization, chromosome territories, co—Iocalization of small
chromosomes in the nucleus center with the exception of chromosome 18, enriched center—toward
inter—chromosomal interactions between elongated or telomere regions of chromosomes, but also
demonstrated the intrinsically dynamic orientations between chromosomes. Therefore, MOGEN is
a useful tool for converting chromosomal contact data into 3D genome models to provide a better
view into the spatial organization of genomes.

The three—dimensional (3D) structures of chromosomes and gen—
omes play an important role in biological processes such as gene
regulation, DNA replication, gene—gene interaction, genome methy—
lation, maintenance of genome stability and recurrent chromosomal
translocation (Dekker, 2008; Fraser and Bickmore, 2007; Miele and
Dekker, 2008; Misteli, 2007). Analyzing 3D structures of chromo—
somes and genomes is, therefore, an important task in studying

been used to study the 3D organization of chromosomes and gen—
omes, however, due to its low throughput and low resolution, it can—
not be applied to study genomes at a fine or large—scale. Recently,
chromosome conformation capture (3C)—based techniques such as
Hi—C (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009) and TCC (Kalhor et (11., 2012)
have emerged as powerful tools for capturing the proximity of
chromosomal fragments Within the same chromosome (intra—

chromosomal contacts) or between different chromosomes (inter—
chromosomal contacts). These chromosomal contacts can provide
new insights into the 3D organization of genomes (Kalhor et (11.,
2012; Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009). Moreover, they can also be
used to infer 3D structures of chromosomes and genomes.

Several methods have been proposed to reconstruct 3D structures
of chromosomes from chromosomal contacts, which adopt one of
the two main strategies (Serra et (11., 2015). The first strategy relies
on the principles of polymer physics of the chromatin to build models
that are consistent with observed chromosomal contacts (Barbieri
et (11., 2013; Mirny, 2011). The second strategy converts chromo—
somal contacts into restraints and then constructs models to satisfy
these restraints. Methods utilize the second strategy are called re—
straint—based methods. A common approach used by restraint—based
methods is to convert chromosomal contacts into spatial distances
first and then solves the problem of satisfying these spatial restraints
as an optimization problem. Depending how restraints are satisfied,
the optimization procedure could yield one single model (Duan et (11.,
2010; Lesne et (11., 2014; Varoquaux et (11., 2014; Zhang et (11., 2013)
or a set of models (Hu et (11., 2013; Rousseau et (11., 2011). We de—
veloped a restraint—based method (Trieu and Cheng, 2014), in which
contacts and non—contacts are supposed to satisfy a distance thresh—
old rather than a specific distance value, which is tackled as an opti—
mization problem. Different from most restraint—based methods, our
method does not require converting contacts into distances. When
contacts are highly consistent and can be satisfied altogether, our
method produces similar models, but when contacts are largely in—
consistent, different models are produced.

Although reasonable 3D structures of individual chromosomes
can be built by some of these methods, it still difficult to reconstruct
3D structures of large genomes such as the human genome consist—
ing of a number of chromosomes from both intra— and inter—chromo—
somal contacts. To the best of our knowledge, currently, no existing
methods had built the structural models of the entire human genome
consisting of 23 pairs of chromosomes from Hi—C data, which ex—
hibit the known features of the human genome such as chromosome
territories and the clustering of small chromosomes in the center
with the exception of chromosome 18.

The limitation could partially be due to the difficulty of handling
noisy and often inconsistent inter—chromosomal contacts of low
interaction frequency (IF) to assemble individual chromosome struc—
tures together while satisfying intra—chromosomal contacts with
much higher IF. In order to overcome this problem, we generalized
our 3D chromosome reconstruction method (Trieu and Cheng,
2014) to make it capable of reconstructing 3D models of a large gen—
ome such as the human genome—utilizing both intra— and inter—
chromosomal contact data. We benchmarked the method on two
synthetic datasets of the yeast genome (Duan et (11., 2010) and of a
polymer worm—like chain model (Trussart et (11., 2015) and the real
Hi—C data of the human genome (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009),
and implemented it as a software tool called MOGEN for users to
reconstruct 3D genome structures.

2 Methods

2.1 Overview of the genome structure reconstruction
process

Our modeling goal is to find positions (i.e. x, y, z coordinates) for
DNA fragments of chromosomes of a genome in the 3D space that
satisfy intra—chromosomal/inter—chromosomal contacts and non—
contacts between the fragments observed in Hi—C datasets of the
genome as much as possible, which is a probabilistic contact—

constrained spatial optimization problem. One challenge of recon—
structing the 3D structure of the whole genome from Hi—C datasets is
to deal with both erroneous and intrinsically inconsistent contacts
caused by the limitations of Hi—C experiments (Yaffe and Tanay,
2011) or variations of genome conformations of a population of cells.
Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of genome structures of a popu—
lation of cells used to generate Hi—C datasets may be a main source of
spatially inconsistent, yet non—noisy contacts. In order to deal with a
large amount of inconsistent contacts, MOGEN aims to satisfy as
many contacts with high probabilities as possible in order to build an
ensemble of probable conformations to approximate the dynamic 3D
genome structures of a population of cells of the same type.

MOGEN translates Hi—C intra— and inter—chromosomal contact
data of a genome into an ensemble of 3D conformations by optimiz—
ing a scoring function that measures the realization of intra— and in—
ter—chromosomal contacts and bonding distance between adjacent
chromosomal regions in three steps (Fig. 1) z (i) normalize raw Hi—C
interaction frequencies into contact likelihood ratios between
chromosomal fragments; (ii) initialize coordinates (x, y, z) of frag—
ments such that all contacts are satisfied initially and contacts be—
tween adjacent fragments are prioritized to be satisfied during the
optimization process; (iii) optimize the scoring function to satisfy as
many non—contacts and contacts with high probability as possible.
MOGEN also evaluates structural models quantitatively and this
evaluation is then used to adjust parameters of MOGEN. A video
demonstrating this modeling process is available at: http://calla.rnet.
missouri.edu/mogenl.

2.2 Normalization, analysis and preprocessing of
contacts

The normalization protocol used in (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009)
was applied to convert each IF into a normalized IF to reduce the
biases and noise in Hi—C data.

The analysis on the Hi—C dataset (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009)
shows that most of intra—chromosomal contacts have higher IF than
most of inter—chromosomal contacts. For instance, 80.2% of intra—
chromosomal contacts have IF larger than 0.65, while 84.5% of in—
ter—chromosomal contacts have IF less than 0.65. This might be

partially due to the situation that the 3D shapes of individual
chromosomes may be more conserved than the relative orientations
between chromosomes in individual cells.

Since contacts with low IFs could be noisy or less likely to hap—
pen, we set cut—off thresholds on IFs to select inter—chromosomal
and intra—chromosomal contacts to construct preferred genome
structures. Contacts with IF below these thresholds are considered
as non—contacts. Theoretically, thresholds for intra— and inter—
chromosomes could be the same. But because inter—chromosomal
contacts are sparser and harder to be satisfied than intra—
chromosomal contacts, we used a lower threshold for inter—
chromosomal contacts in order to increase the number of satisfied
inter—chromosomal contacts. In our experiment for the Hi—C dataset
(Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009), the cut—off thresholds of 0.65 and
0.58 for intra—chromosomal and inter—chromosomal contacts, re—
spectively, worked best in term of maximizing the number of
chromosomal contacts that could be satisfied while preventing small
chromosomes in the nucleus center from intermingling.

2.3 A probabilistic chromosomal contact—based

scoring function

The core of our probabilistic contact—based method of modeling 3D
genome structures (MOGEN) is a data—driven scoring function com—
prising terms that probabilistically constrain distance ranges be—
tween two adjacent (i.e. physically bonded) DNA fragments,
between two spatially contacted fragments in the same chromo—
some, between two non—contacted fragments in the same chromo—
some, between two contacted fragments from two different
chromosomes, and between two non—contacted fragments from two
different chromosomes. This function is generalized from the func—
tion in (Trieu and Cheng, 2014) to include inter—chromosomal con—
tacts and non—contacts.

The first term in the scoring function enforces distance con—
straints on contacted, but non—adjacent fragments and also their
minimum distances for avoiding clashes according to contact prob—
ability proportional to interaction frequency. In other words, the
value of the function increases as the distance between two con—
tacted fragments (dii: distance between midpoints of 1th fragment of
chromosome chr1 and jth fragment of chromosome Chr2) gets
smaller than the contact distance threshold dC and/or gets larger
than the minimum distance threshold between contacted fragments
dmin. Here, totalIF is the sum of normalized interaction frequencies

of the whole genome calculated from the input Hi—C data; F,,- is the
normalized IF between fragments i and j; and IFmax is the maximum
IF among all contacts. Fii weights the inﬂuence of a contact propor—
tionally according to its normalized IF, i.e. a contact with higher IF
contributes more to the value of the function, which essentially tries
to enforce contacts in a probabilistic way. The second term enforces
the minimum and maximum distance on two adjacent fragments on
the same chromosome. damax is the maximum distance threshold be—
tween two adjacent fragments on the same chromosome. The third
term enforces constraints on pairs of fragments that are not in con—
tact and in the same chromosome. In particular, the score increases
as the distance between non—contacted fragments get larger than dc
and/or smaller than the maximum intra—chromosomal distance
threshold dmaxima. The last term exerts forces on distances of pairs
of fragments that are not in contact and in different chromosomes to
make them less than the maximum inter—chromosomal distance
threshold dam,lxinter and greater than dc.

W1 [chr1, chr2], W2 [chr1, chr2], W3 [chr1, chr2]and W4 [chr1, chr2]
are adjustable parameters for fragment pairs of chromosomes chr1
and chr2 to weigh and balance the inﬂuences of scoring terms asso—
ciated with inter—chromosomal contacts or non—contacts if chr1 is
not equal to chr2 and otherwise with intra—chromosomal contacts or
non—contacts. To avoid biases against different chromosomes and re—
duce the complexity of optimization, the values of W1, W2, W3 or W4
for any pair of chromosomes are the same. Thus, the number of par—
ameters is much smaller than assigning different weights to different
pairs of chromosomes, which makes the parameter adjustment sim—
pler. Theoretically, the weights for different chromosomes can be
the same. However, when the same weights were used for all the
chromosomes, the qualities of models for different chromosomes
were different. This could be due to the different sizes and different
ratios of contacts and non—contacts of different chromosomes (e.g.
small chromosomes have higher contacts/non—contacts ratio).
Therefore, allowing different weights for different chromosomes ac—
cording to their individual properties can help produce better mod—
els for chromosomes. These parameters are adjusted to maximize
the number of satisfied contacts and non—contacts and to prevent
different chromosomes from intermingling with each other.

2.4 Estimation of parameters in the scoring function

The physical parameters (dmimdamax, dmamm, dmaximﬂ) for the
human B—cells in the scoring function were approximately set ac—
cording to the previous knowledge about the overall sizes of
chromosomes and the nucleus gained from the chromosome struc—
tural modeling and FISH experiments (Mateos—Langerak et (11.,
2009; Trieu and Cheng, 2014). The values of d2 da2

min7 max

were set at
0.2and1.8(um2)(micrometer), respectively, the same as in (Trieu
and Cheng, 2014). The contact distance threshold d? was estimated
based on the average distance of pairs of regions measured in the
FISH data (Mateos—Langerak et (11., 2009) as described in Trieu and
Cheng (2014). We approximated this value at 6pm2 (lower than
7pm2 in Trieu and Cheng, 2014) to reduce the size of chromosomes
and the intermingling between them. drzmmua was set at 20pm2 the

same as d2 in Trieu and Cheng (2014). The unit of distances is in

max

square for convenience because we use the square of distances in the

scoring function to simplify the calculation of gradient and the im—

plementation of the optimization. dmaxinter was set to the approxi—
mate value of the diameter of the nucleus (i.e.13um).

The weight parameters W1, W2, W3 and W4 for all chromosome

pairs were estimated according to the two criteria: (i) intra—chromo—

somal contact and non—contact scores (percentage of contacts and

9103 ‘Og JSanV uo sajaﬁuv soc] ‘Bnuomcg JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'S[BIIJHO[pJOJXO'SOIJBLUJOJIIIOIq/ﬂduq 11101} papacjumoq

non—contacts that are satisfied) should be high (over 60%); and (ii)
chromosome territories (separable space of each chromosome) must
be largely enforced, i.e. the 3D space of chromosomes should not be
seriously intermingled, which can be achieved when inter—chromo—
somal non—contact scores are high (over 60%). The rationale behind
these two criteria is that each chromosome largely occupies its own
territories without significant intermingling with others, but neigh—
boring chromosomes could border each other closely (Cremer and
Cremer, 2010; Parada and Misteli, 2002); and that inter—chromo—
somal contacts are much weaker than intra—chromosomal contacts
and thus should have a lower priority of being satisfied. In searching
for values of these parameters, they were initialized to 0.05, and
then, depending on which contact or non—contact scores were low,
their corresponding weight parameters would get increased. The
intra—chromosomal contact and non—contact scores of chromosomes
were expected to be higher than 60% in order to ensure good
chromosome structures. The parameters corresponding to inter—
chromosomal contact scores were increased to get inter—chromo—
somal contacts scores as high as possible, while at the same time in—
ter—chromosomal non—contact scores must be maintained higher
than 6 0%. This would maximize interactions between chromosomes
while maintaining chromosome territories. For the dataset of the
human genome used here, the range of values was finally settled
within [0.05, 14.5], but it may vary for different datasets. The de—
tailed values and configuration of the parameters are described in
the Supplementary Material.

2.5 Structure initialization

The (x, y, z) coordinates of fragments of each chromosome were
randomly initialized with values in a small, symmetric range
[70.5, 0.5] to facilitate the gradient—ascent optimization, subject to
the condition that the difference between the coordinates of two ad—
jacent fragments were not larger than a small number (i.e. 0.025) to
make sure the proximity of adjacent fragments was satisfied during
the optimization. This simple initialization is important for the suc—
cessful structure optimization when the input data contains noisy in—
ter—chromosomal contacts.

2.6 Structure optimization

An important component of the method is an optimizer that
maximizes the scoring function Fn above to generate genome struc—
tures. We used the gradient ascent optimization with adaptive step
sizes to generate genome structures starting from randomly
initialized structures. The search for a new step size was performed
only when the scoring function stopped increasing. For convenience,
MOGEN allows users to specify the initial step size. Calculating
the value of the scoring function and its gradient with respect to
(x, y, z) coordinates was the bottleneck of the optimization process
so parallel threads were used in MOGEN to speed up the
calculation.

2.7 Implementation

MOGEN was implemented in Java and can run on different plat—
forms. The core of the tool is an optimizer to optimize the scoring
function as described in Section 2.6. Structures were initialized as in
Section 2.5. The initial structure was further optimized by gradient
ascent according to the scoring function. The final structures are
stored in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) format and can be visualized
by popular visualizers such as PyMOL or Chimera. For each struc—
ture, MOGEN also computes contact and non—contact scores and
outputs these scores in a separate text file. The values of the

thresholds and weights used by MOGEN are configured in text files.
The implementation details are described in Supplementary
Material.

3 Results

We validated our method on two independent synthetic datasets,
one from a polymer worm—like chain model (Trussart et (11., 2015)
and one from a yeast genome model consisting of several chromo—
somes (Duan et (11., 2010). The validation on the dataset of the
worm—like chain model is described in Section 3.1 and the validation
on the dataset of the yeast genome is included in the Supplementary
Material.

3.1 Validation on synthetic polymer worm—like chain
models and comparison with TADbit

We used a synthetic dataset in Trussart et al. (2015), which simu—
lated both noise and structural variability in Hi—C data using a poly—
mer worm—like chain model of length ~1 Mb represented by 202
bins of size 5 kb, to validate our method. The model also simulated
Topologically Associated Domain (TAD)—like architecture (Dixon
et (11., 2012). There are 7 levels of structural variability represented
by 7 sets of 100 models (called true structures), denoting as Set 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 varied from low structural variability to high vari—
ability. And at each level of structural variability, there are 4 levels
of noise (50, 100, 150 and 200, respectively). In total, there are 28
contact matrices (i.e., four matrices for each set of 100 true struc—
tures). Matrices were normalized as in Trussart et al. (2015). For
each input matrix, we generated an ensemble of 100 structures. We
checked if there was a structure in the ensemble that was similar to
the true structures. Following Trussart et al. (2015), the Spearman
correlation was used to assess if two structure were similar. The
structure in the ensemble that is most similar to each true structure
was selected, and the correlations between the true structures with
their selected counterparts were averaged and used as the accuracy
of the ensemble of generated structures. Figure 2 shows these accu—
racies for the ensembles of structures generated at different levels of
noise and structural variability. It can be seen that the accuracy of
generated structures is high when the structural variability is low,
even though the noise level is high. However, the average quality of
generated structures decreases as the level of structural variability in—
creases. Overall, MOGEN is robust against noise and performs well
at reasonable levels of structural variability.

We compared the performance of MOGEN and TADbit (Bali
and Marti—Renom, 2012) on the synthetic dataset. The structures
generated by TADbit were provided together with the synthetic
dataset. There is one structure generated by TADbit for each input
matrix. For each structure generated by TADbit, we selected its
most similar counterpart in the ensemble of true structures, and
used the corresponding correlation between the two to compare
with the correlation between the most similar pair of structures gen—
erated by MOGEN and true structures. We performed the compari—
son on the lowest noise level and the highest noise level,
respectively. Figures 3 and 4 show the results on the lowest and
highest noise levels, respectively. Overall, their performances are
comparable across different levels of noise and structural variability,
while MOGEN seems to be somewhat more robust against noise
and TADbit seems to be less sensitive to structural variability. But
the difference is not significant.

3.2 The structures of the human genome reconstructed
from real Hi—C data

We used MOGEN to generate an ensemble of 500 genome struc—
tures from the Hi—C data of the normal human lymphoblastoid cell
line (GM06990) (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009). The dataset was
normalized as described in Section 2.2. The distance parameters
were set as in Section 2.4. We then adjusted weights as described in
Section 2.4 to generate structures. As for this dataset, like all exist—
ing methods, MOGEN could not distinguish homologous chromo—
somes and identify interactions between all pairs of 46
chromosomes. So we built the genome structures consisting of one
complete set of 23 chromosomal models, each corresponding to the
average structure of a pair of homologous chromosomes. These
structures have the known features of the human genome. The gen—
erated structures are available at http://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/
mogenl.

Figure 5 visualizes a 3D genome structure (chromosomes 1—23
were labeled as letter A—X, respectively, with the letter L omitted). It
is shown that the model exhibits the known genome structural fea—
ture of chromosome territories as expected, i.e. each chromosome
largely occupies its own space instead of mixing together, even
though there are some strong interactions between some regions of a
few pairs of small chromosomes in the center of the nucleus. This
demonstrates that the parameters of the modeling process had been

adjusted effectively to realize the separate territories of individual
chromosomes during the process of satisfying intra— and inter—
chromosomal contacts.

A striking feature of the global topology of the human genome is
that smaller chromosomes (chromosome 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 22)
except chromosome 18 form a core at the center surrounded by
larger chromosomes (chromosome 1715, X) lying near the periphery
(Fig. 63).

3.3 Consistency of individual chromosome structures
across different genome structures

By visualizing structures, it is observed that individual chromosome
structures in different genome structures in the ensemble were simi—
lar. For instance, the average structural similarity score (the CDT—
HA score) of the structural models of chromosome 1 (i.e. the largest
chromosome of the human genome) calculated by a modified ver—
sion of the TM—score program (Trieu and Cheng, 2014; Zhang and
Skolnick, 2004) is 0.71 (with minimum, maximum and standard de—
viation are 0.5, 0.98 and 0.06, respectively, which is much higher
than the similarity score (generally < 0.2) of two random structures
of the same length. The structures of individual chromosomes also
have the two—compartment feature (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009;
Trieu and Cheng, 2014) (Fig. 7), e.g. the two chromosomal com—
partments (euchromatin and heterochromatin) of chromosome 11
identified by the principal component analysis as in Lieberman—
Aiden et al. (2009) and Trieu and Cheng (2014) were spatially clus—
tered together as expected. These results may suggest that the global
shape of individual chromosomes may be largely preserved in the
varied genome structures of the population of cells used to generate
the Hi—C data.

3.4 Variability of the relative orientation and position

of chromosomes in genome structures

Despite the relatively high similarity between chromosome struc—
tures in different genome models, the similarity between the overall
genome structures in the ensemble is very low. The average GDT—
HA score between genome structures is 0.16, suggesting that the
conformations of the whole genomes, particularly, the orientations
of chromosomes in the ensemble, vary a lot. This is not surprising
because the genome conformations of single cells in the cell popula—
tion used to generate the Hi—C data likely vary. Indeed, different
from the majority of intra—chromosomal contacts being satisfied,
satisfying inter—chromosomal contacts is more difficult possibly due
to the intrinsic inconsistency within inter—chromosomal contacts
caused by the dynamics of the genome structures in the population

matrix calculated from the Hi—C data and that derived from all re—
constructed 3D models in the ensemble is 0.48 with an significant
e—value P < 2.2e — 16. This suggests that each genome structure still
captures a significant portion of inter—chromosomal contacts that
can be consistently realized in one genome structural model, which
may correspond to the realistic structure of one cell or a subset of
cells and/or to the structural patterns conserved in all genome struc—
tures. Indeed, there is a consistent global topology of genome models
that smaller chromosomes are preferably clustered together to form
a more rigid core of the genome, and that larger chromosomes lie in
the periphery of the genome surrounding small chromosomes
(Fig. 63).

Figure 6b illustrates the average distance between the centers of
the mass of individual chromosomes (indexed from 1 to 23) and the
center of the mass of the genome structure (indexed as 0) calculated
from all genome models. Except for chromosome 18, the centers of
small chromosomes were near the center of the genome while
the centers of larger chromosomes were further away from it,
which is consistent with the previous study that small chromosomes
frequently co—localize in the center of the nucleus (Boyle et (11.,
2001; Tanabe et (11., 2002). However, as an exception, the location
of the small but gene—poor chromosome 18 is near the periphery
also agrees with the previous FISH study (Croft et (11., 1999)
(Fig. 6c).

3.5 Contact patterns between elongated regions of
chromosomes

In light of this core—periphery architecture of the 3D human gen—
ome, we investigated how chromosomes may interact to form this
organization. We found that most interactions between two
chromosomes occurred between telomeres (within 10 MB from the
two ends of a chromosome), between telomeres and centromeres
(within 5 MB from the omitted centromere loci of a chromosome),
and between centromeres as shown in Imakaev et al. (2012). Figure
8a visualizes the heatmap of average inter—chromosomal distances
between chromosomal regions computed from all 3D genome mod—
els (the intensity of red indicates proximity). And if two chromo—
somes are in contact, it is more likely that their telomeres are in
contact. Centromere—centromere or centromere—telomere inter—
actions are also more likely than regions outside of centromeres and
telomeres, although the difference between centromere—centromere
distances and centromere—telomere distances is not significant.
Figure 8b illustrates interactions between chromosome 4, 6, 11 and
14 occurring in telomeres and centromeres. In addition to the en—
riched interaction among telomeres and centromeres, large chromo—
somes lying near the periphery generally have elongated regions,
centromeres and/or telomeres that extend towards the nucleus cen—
ter, where small and gene—rich chromosomes are located (Fig. 8c).
And this interaction pattern is a consistent structural feature among
most 3D genome models even though the overall orientations and
relative locations between chromosomes are highly varied. As a re—
sult, if a large chromosome interacts with other chromosomes in the
nucleus center, some specific regions (telomeres, centromeres and/or
an elongated region) rather than other regions are often involved in
interactions.

4 Conclusions

We developed a method called MOGEN to reconstruct 3D genome
structures from Hi—C data. We tested MOGEN on the synthetic
datasets of a yeast genome and of a polymer worm—like chain model
and then applied it to reconstruct 3D genome structures of human
B—cells. The rigorous testing shows that MOGEN is a useful method
for translating chromosomal Hi—C data into 3D structures to facili—
tate the study of the spatial organization of genomes and its role in
biological processes such as gene regulation, epigenetic modification
and DNA replication.

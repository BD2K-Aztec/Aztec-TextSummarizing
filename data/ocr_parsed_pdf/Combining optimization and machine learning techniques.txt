where (j) is a suitably chosen RBF, aj are the coefﬁcients of the
linear expansion and cf, are the centers of the RBFs. We used the
inverse multiquadric RBF in our experiments:

¢(r) = (r2 + 02)

where a is a positive scalar. This choice was mainly motivated by
the fact that the multiquadric function showed the best perform—
ance in expression proﬁle approximation. To ﬁnd the approxi—
mation, we solved the following regularized problem:

0,6 [:1

where y(t,~) is the expression of the gene at the sampling instant t,~.
The number of RBFs, the REF parameter a and the regulariza—
tion parameters 11 and 12 were the same for all the approxima—
tions and were obtained by means of a global optimization
algorithm. The idea behind this approach is that of determining
the values of the parameters that better represent the biological
process under analysis. For a given choice of m, a, 11 and 12, we
computed the expression proﬁle approximations and the corres—
ponding scores p of the genes in the dataset used for the training
of the SVM.

3.3 Cell culture, synchronization and FACS analysis

Early passage of human foreskin ﬁbroblasts was grown in
Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal
Calf Serum (FCS). For G0/G1 synchronization, cells were ar—
rested with 0.5% FCS (48 h) and then released in 10% FCS.
Cells were harvested at speciﬁc time points following serum
stimulation and were processed. The progression of cells through
the cell cycle was monitored by ﬂow cytometric (FACS) analysis
of replicate samples of propidium iodide—stained cells (Gurtner
et al., 2008).

RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase—polymerase chain
reaction (RT—PCR). Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol
reagent (Gibco BRL) and following the manufacturer’s instruc—
tions. The first strand of complementary DNA was synthesized
according to manufacture instructions of the M—MLV RT kit
(Invitrogen). PCR was performed with HOT—MASTER Taq
(Eppendorf) using 2ml of complementary DNA reaction. The
primer sequences of the human genes are as follows:

4 RESULTS

4.1 In vivo validation of LEON predicted cell cycle-
regulated genes

Using LEON algorithm we selected 50 genes having the highest
pmmh score and excluded 5 genes that were identiﬁed as cycling
also by Bar—Joseph et a]. (2008). Among the remaining 45 new
putatively cycling genes, we experimentally validated the cell
cycle—dependent expression of 9 of them. To this purpose, pri—
mary human ﬁbroblasts prepared from human foreskin were
grown to ~50% conﬂuence and synchronized in Go by serum
deprivation. Cultures were then released from arrest, and cells
were collected at different time points covering one complete cell
cycle (Fig. 8A).

We used RT—PCR to measure the expression level of the nine
genes with higher combined score (see Supplementary Table S2
and Fig. 7) along synchronized cell populations. None of these
genes result to be cell cycle—regulated in the study by Bar—Joseph
et a]. (2008), demonstrating the strength of the LEON algorithm
in identifying cell cycle—expressed genes. As shown in Figure 8B
(RT—PCR) and Supplementary Figure S1 (densitometric ana—
lysis), the expression of these nine genes is cell cycle—regulated
being maximum on S phase for six and on G1 phase for four of
them, respectively.

Interestingly, the expression of two of these genes, NCORl
and EDF—1, is already known to be cell cycle—regulated further

conﬁrming the predictive power of the LEON algorithm
(Altintas et al., 2011; Bolognese et al., 2006). Next we measured
the expression level of four genes with a low combined score. Of
note, the expression of these genes is not regulated during the cell
cycle further demonstrating that the LEON algorithm speciﬁc—
ally identiﬁes the cell cycle gene expression. We measured cyclin
A and cyclin B1 as well as GAPDH and aldolase genes as posi—
tive and negative controls, respectively. It is well known that
cyclin A and B1 expression is cell cycle dependent being high
in S phase and in G2, respectively (Pines and Hunter, 1989,
1990). On the contrary, the expression of GAPDH and aldolase
genes is constant during the cell cycle (Eisenberg and Levanon,
2003). As expected, cyclin expression is cell cycle dependent,
whereas GAPDH and aldolase expression is constant. These re—
sults demonstrate that our approach is successful in identifying
cell cycle—regulated genes.

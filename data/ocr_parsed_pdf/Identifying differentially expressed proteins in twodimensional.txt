ABSTRACT

Background: Two-dimensional electrophoresis is a crucial method in
proteomics that allows the characterization of proteins’ function and
expression. This usually implies the identification of proteins that are
differentially expressed between two contrasting conditions, for
example, healthy versus diseased in human proteomics biomarker
discovery and stressful conditions versus control in animal experimen-
tation. The statistical procedures that lead to such identifications are
critical steps in the 2-DE analysis workflow. They include a normaliza-
tion step and a test and probability correction for multiple testing.
Statistical issues caused by the high dimensionality of the data and
large-scale multiple testing have been a more active topic in transcrip-
tomics than proteomics, especially in microarray analysis. We thus
propose to adapt innovative statistical tools developed for microarray
analysis and incorporate them in the 2-DE analysis pipeline.

Results: In this article, we evaluate the performance of different nor-
malization procedures, different statistical tests and false discovery
rate calculation methods with both real and simulated datasets. We
demonstrate that the use of statistical procedures adapted from
microarrays lead to notable increase in power as well as a minimiza-
tion of false-positive discovery rate. More specifically, we obtained the
best results in terms of reliability and sensibility when using the ‘mod-
erate t-test’ from Smyth in association with classic false discovery rate
from Benjamini and Hochberg.

1 INTRODUCTION

Comparative proteomics based on 2D-polyacrylamide gel elec-
trophoresis aims at identifying signiﬁcant biologically relevant
proteins. In most cases, protein samples from two conditions
are compared, e. g. healthy versus diseased in human proteomics
biomarker discovery (Kim et al., 2004), or stressful conditions
versus control in animal experimentation (Tomanek et al., 2011).

Besides the laboratory bench, informatics takes a large place in
such experiments with digitalization of gels, spots detection and
matching, evaluation of spots’ volumes and identiﬁcation of
differentially expressed proteins.

A large variety of software designed for the analysis of 2D
digitized images exist, both commercial (e.g. Delta2D from
Decodon, SameSpot Progenesis from Nonlinear dynamics,
PDQuest from Bio-rad laboratories) and custom researcher-
developed (e.g. Pinnacle from Morris et al., 2010; RegStatGel
from Li and Seillier-Moiseiwitsch, 2011). These programs per-
form three main tasks: identiﬁcation of spots, matching of spots
from different gels and evaluation of spots’ volumes. Each pro-
gram has its own way to perform these steps; therefore, software
choice has a great impact on the result of the analysis (Millioni
et al., 2012; Morris et al., 2010; Stessl et al., 2009; Wheelock and
Buckpitt, 2005). A normalization step is also needed to remove
the systemic variation before data analysis. An issue with com-
mercial software is the lack of information concerning this crit-
ical step as well as the inability to customize the normalization
procedure. Ultimately, once spots’ volumes have been estimated
and normalized across gels, proteins that are differentially
expressed between groups are identified with software-specific
methods.

Normalization and identiﬁcation are also essential steps in
2-DE-based proteomics analysis and, as compared with other
critical steps of the 2-DE procedure (e.g. protein extraction,
staining, image analysis), are less studied and under-reviewed
in the literature. On the other hand, the same issues have been
widely studied and reviewed for transcriptomic analysis, espe-
cially for microarray studies. As pointed out by some authors,
the underlying statistical issues are similar between microarray-
and 2-DE analyses. A number of the statistical tools developed
for microarray analysis have begun to be incorporated in the
2-DE toolbox. More speciﬁcally, advances in normalization
have been adapted to Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE)
analysis (Fodor et al., 2005; Miecznikowski et al., 2011).
Statistical tests developed for microarrays have also been evalu-
ated (Fodor et al., 2005; Meunier et al., 2005). Finally, numerous
authors highlight the need of correction for multiple testing, such
as false discovery rate (FDR), but few actually evaluate the per-
formance of the different procedures (Chang et al., 2004; Karp
et al., 2007; Morris, 2012).

The aim of the present work is to evaluate different methods,
initially developed for microarray analysis, to identify differential

spots in 2-DE experiments. To compare these methods, real
datasets as well as simulated data were used. We also compare
methods for normalization of volumes’ data before statistical
analysis. By evaluating the key steps of the analysis workﬂow,
from normalization to identiﬁcation of differentially expressed
spots, our motivation is to provide a simple and adapted work-
ﬂow to non-statistics expert biochemists. All the methods
discussed are available as a free, open-source R package
(R Core Team, 2012) with highly customizable options.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets description

2.1.] Platichthys flesus liver dataset The Platichthys ﬂesus liver
dataset (Pﬂ DS)corresponded to a 2-DE-based comparison of liver prote-
omes of two populations of Platichthys ﬂesus living in contrasted estu-
aries, i.e. the Seine estuary, known to be highly polluted, and the Canche,
which is often considered as a pristine area. The whole study was previ-
ously published in Galland et al. (2013). It included analyzing the liver
proteomes of four juvenile individuals from each estuary.

2.1.2 Pecten maximus gills dataset The Pecten maximus gills data-
set (Prng DS) is issued from a 2-DE experiment performed on proteins
from Pecten maximus gills subjected to a temperature challenge. Brieﬂy,
scallops were kept in two separate tanks at 164°C (:l:0.3°C) (Huber et al.,
2002) and fed ad libitum for 2 weeks. One tank was then heated at 1°C per
day and allowed to reach 27°C (‘hot condition’), whereas the other tank
was kept at 165°C (‘control’). At the end of the experiment, six animals
per condition were sampled. Gills were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
kept at —80°C until protein extraction. Gills were crushed (using Retsch®
MM400) device kept frozen using liquid nitrogen. Hundred milligrams of
the obtained powder was homogenized in 100 mM TrisiHCl (pH 6.8),
centrifuged (4° C, 50 000 g, 5 min) and supernatants were pipetted in other
tubes. Protease inhibitor mix (GE Healthcare) was then added and
nucleic acids were removed (nuclease mix, GE Healthcare, following
manufacturer’s instructions). Samples were precipitated overnight at
—20°C using TCA 20% (1/1:v/v, overnight). After centrifugation (4°C,
20 000g, 30 min), pellets were washed with acetone 70% and 0.1% DTT
and re-suspended in urea/thiourea buffer (2M thiourea, 7M urea, 4%
CHAPS, 1% DTT) containing 1% IPG (pH 3710, GE Healthcare).
Protein concentration was determined using a modiﬁed Bradford
assay12, and all samples were adjusted to 400 mg of proteins in 250 pl.
Electrophoresis and staining procedures were performed as described in
Galland et al. (2013).

2.2 Preprocessing of data

2.2.] Image Analysis All gels were digitized using a transparency
scanner (Epson Perfection V700) in gray scale with 16-bit depth and a
resolution of 600 dpi. Images were aligned and spots were detected and
quantiﬁed with the Progenesis SameSpots software (Nonlinear dynamics,
v.3.3) using the automated algorithm. All detected spots were manually
carefully checked and artifact spots were removed. Datasets were
exported as raw values in the form of a matrix of volume data X,, with
spots 1' as rows and gels j as columns. In all, 611 spots were identiﬁed in
the Pﬂ dataset from Galland et al. (2013) with four replicates in two
conditions (611 x 8 matrix), and 766 spots were identiﬁed in the ng
dataset with six replicates per condition (766 x 12 matrix).

2.3 Visualization and normalization of datasets

Dudoit et al. (2002) proposed a method for visualization of artifacts
in microarray datasets, called the MA-plot, which was transposed for

proteomics data as the ratio-intensity plot (Meunier et al., 2005; R-I
plot). It consists in plotting the intensity logz-ratio (R) against mean
loglo intensity (I):

R = logz mean( VCondZ)
mean( VCondl)

I = 10g10(mean(VCond2) X (mean(VCondl))

where VCondl and VCond2 are spots’ volumes for conditions 1 and 2,
respectively.

R-I plots allow to directly visualize artifacts in the original dataset as
well as the effects of normalization (Fig. 1). Artifacts were already
described for Coomassie blue-stained 2-DE gels, but have also been re-
ported in DIGE, SYPRO ruby and silver-stained experiments. In the
original datasets (Fig. 1A and B), the cloud of points seems to be off-
centered, especially for low-intensity spots, either down-shifted in ng
DS or up-shifted in Pﬂ DS.

Among the variety of methods for normalization recently proposed in
the literature, both for proteomics and microarray experiments
(Podrabsky and Somero, 2004; Quackenbush, 2002; Yang et al., 2002),
two widely used methods are compared, the ‘Variance Stabilizing
Normalization’ (VSN; Huber et al., 2002) and the ‘Quantile
Normalization’ (Qt; Bolstad et al., 2003). The principle of the ‘quantile
normalization’ is to set each quantile of each column (i.e. the spots’
volume data of each gels) to the mean of that quantile across gels. The
intention is to make all the normalized columns have the same empirical
distribution. Whereas the VSN method relies on a transformation h of the
intensities, of the parametric form h( x ) = arsinh (a + bx ) .The parameters
of h are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood estima-
tion. The R-I plots of normalized data (Fig. 1) show that both methods
center the data around a log ratio of 0. Nevertheless, for low values of
intensities the VSN normalized data (Fig. 1E and F) seem to be less
efﬁcient to recenter the cloud of points.

2.4 False discovery rate and signiﬁcance

Transcriptomics and 2-DE experiments analyses have in common that
they require a variant of a t statistic that is suitable for high-dimensional
data and large-scale multiple testing. For this purpose, in the past few
years, various test procedures have been suggested. We decided to com-
pare a simple method (the classical Student’s t-test), two tests especially

Identifying differentially expressed proteins

 

modiﬁed for microarray analysis (Efron’s t-test; Efron et al., 2001), the
modiﬁed t-test used in signiﬁcance analysis for microarray (SAM; Tusher
et al., 2001) and two methods that take advantage of hierarchical Bayes
methods for estimation of the variance across genes: the ‘moderate t-test’
from Smyth (2004) and the ‘Shrinkage t’ statistic test from Opgen-Rhein
and Strimmer (2007).

Statistical tests allowing the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed
proteins must take into account a correction for multiple tests to avoid
false conclusions. Testing for expression changes across hundreds or
thousands of proteins with univariate test, such as Student’s t-test,
causes false positives to accumulate. To address this issue in multiple
comparison procedure, Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) proposed a
method for estimating and controlling the FDR, allowing for
‘FDR-driven’ decision of signiﬁcance.

In proteomics, the FDR is usually deﬁned as the ratio of the proteins
not differentially expressed in reality but declared differentially expressed
by the test, over the total number of proteins declared differentially
expressed by the test [Table 1; FDR = FP/(TP + FP)].

From a statistical point of View, there are two types of FDR, the
‘classic’ tail area-based FDR (Fair in Efron, 2008) and the local FDR
(fair in Efron, 2008). As it is easier to interpret for non-specialists, we
focused our study on tail area-based FDR methods.

We decided to compare four different FDR estimators: (i) the classical
FDR estimator of Benjamini and Hochberg, (ii) Strimmer’s FDR (based
on local FDR calculation; Strimmer, 2008a), (iii) the ‘robust Fdr’ estima-
tor of Pounds and Cheng (2006) and (iv) the widely used FDR method
known as ‘q-value’ deﬁned by Storey (2002) and improved in 2004
(Storey et al., 2004).

To evaluate the impact of the normalization on the number of spots
declared signiﬁcant as well as the impact of the statistical test and mode
of calculation for FDR, the following workﬂow was used for each
dataset:

(1) Normalization of raw volume data with either VSN or quantile
methods.

(2) Calculation of statistic value for normalized volume data using
Student’s t-test, Moderate t-test, SAM statistic, Efron’s t-test and
shrinkage t-test.

(3) Computation of P-values for each test based on a null distribution
estimated using the fdrtool package (Strimmer, 2008b).

(4) FDR values were calculated using P-values as input with
Benjamini and Hochberg (‘BH’), Strimmer (‘Stri’), Pounds and
Cheng (‘PC’) or Storey (‘Sto’) procedures.

(5) Spots under a cut-off of 0.1 were declared signiﬁcantly differen-
tially expressed between the conditions.

2.5 Simulations study

To compare FDR and the responses of the different tests as well as the
inﬂuence of the number of replicates, simulated data were used. Data

were simulated based on parameter estimates of ng dataset, following
these steps:

(1) Log mean volumes from ng DS were computed for each spot.

(2) Means were used as input parameters to simulate a normal distri-
bution (with no differential expression between conditions) for
each spot with standard deviations computed as described by
Smyth (2004).

(3) Ten percent of spots were randomly picked for introducing differ-
ential expression in both conditions (5% in each condition).

Brieﬂy, in this hierarchical Bayesian model, the distribution is con-
trolled by hyperparameters s02 (estimator of the standard deviation)
and do (the degrees of freedom of the x2 distribution used in the calcu-
lation of the distribution; see Smyth, 2004 for details). To simulate
realistic data, we used s02: 0.2 and do: 3.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Results from ng and PH datasets

As seen in Table 2, both the moderate t—test and the classical
Student’s t—test seem to (i) be the most coherent among the com-
pared tests and (ii) detect a greater number of differentially
expressed spots. The effectiveness of the moderate t—test stems
from its very deﬁnition: a modiﬁed t—test for which the standard
errors have been moderated across spots, i.e. shrunk toward a
common value, using a simple Bayesian model. As already
demonstrated with microarray data, the smoothing of the stand-
ard errors increases the reliability of the test (Smyth, 2004).

two methods for normalization: VSN and Qt. Four methods of FDR
calculation are also compared: BH (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995); Stri

Another striking fact is the inconstancy of Pounds and
Cheng’s ‘robust Fdr’ method throughout the results (e.g. from
0 spots detected for classic t-test to 172 for Efron’s t—test for ng
VSN data). This might reﬂect that ‘robust Fdr’ is not well
adapted to 2D gel data, where the null proportion (the propor-
tion of spots not differentially expressed) is high. Actually, the
authors warned about the instability of the FDR estimates when
this null proportion nears 1 (Pounds and Cheng, 2006). Putting
aside ‘robust Fdr’ results, SAM’s, Efron’s and the shrinkage
t—test are relatively consistent with both normalization methods
but detect almost no signiﬁcant proteins in the Pﬂ dataset.
Finally, the standard Student t—test is consistent among all con-
ditions but detected less signiﬁcant proteins than the moderate
t—test.

Concerning the normalization method, the results from
Table 2 do not allow making a clear decision between VSN or
quantile methods. Nevertheless, as shown in R-I plots (Fig. 1),
Qt could be more appropriate for normalization of 2-DE volume
data, especially with low intensities.

3.2 Validity of simulated data

To validate the simulated data, we compared the distribution of
simulated data with real datasets (Fig. 2). Simulated data with
four replicates per condition were compared with Pﬂ DS and
simulated data with six replicates were compared with ng
DS. The distribution of standard deviation and the R-I plot is
illustrative of real proteomic datasets.

3.3 Comparisons of FDR modes of estimation

Simulations were used to evaluate the effect of FDR mode of
calculation. For each mode, 100 simulations were run (with 10
replicates), and the number of significant differentially expressed
proteins for each test and each Fdr was computed. To compare
Fdr threshold with actual FDR values, 10 different threshold
values were used (from 0.05 to 0.9). The real value of the FDR

was then calculated and compared with the threshold used
(Fig. 3). Results show a good correlation between the threshold
and the different calculated FDR for high-FDR values.
However, for lower values, which are more crucial in this kind
of analysis (acceptable FDR is generally acknowledged to be
10% in proteomics), the robust FDR method tended to under-
estimate actual FDR, thus increasing the discovery of proteins
falsely declared differentially expressed. Nevertheless, the other
methods appeared appropriate in the whole range of values, and
are thus potentially more useful for these kind of data.

Furthermore, we evaluated tests and FDR mode by running
100 simulations without differential expression (by skipping step
3 of the data simulation process). For ‘robust Fdr’, an average
of 31.244.12 spots (depending on the test used) were declared
significant, whereas for the other methods, the average propor-
tion of spots declared differentially expressed was <1 for all tests
(from 0.08 to 0.85). This clearly indicates that the robust FDR
tends to select undifferentially expressed spots when the null
proportion is high.

3.4 Inﬂuence of the number of replicates depends on the
test and the FDR calculation mode

One of the main issues reported in proteomics studies is the low
number of replicates per condition. We have simulated data with
20, 10, 8, 6, 4 and 3 replicates to determine how this affected the
different statistical tests results in terms of false positives and
false negatives (Fig. 4). For all these tests, the FDR cut-off
was set to 0.1. To assess the power (or sensitivity) of the tests,
the false non-discovery rate (FnDR) was also calculated as the
number of false negatives over the total number of significant
proteins [FnDR = FN/(FN + TN)].

As previously observed, the robust FDR method clearly
underestimated the false-positive discovery, even for large num-
bers of replicates. The method from Storey also showed a rela-
tively high number of false positives for small numbers of

increases. We observed similar patterns for classic FDR (‘BH’)
and Strimmer, i.e. the calculated FDR decreased as we increased
the number of replicates. Considering the FnDR, we also
observed a similar pattern between these two methods, i.e.
FnDR decreased as a function of the number of replicates. All
the tests displayed this pattern. However, we showed that the
classical t—test strongly increased the FDR, especially in combin-
ation with low numbers of replicates. As for FDR calculation,
FnDR did not decrease as rapidly with the classical t—test, as
compared with the other tests. By contrast, the test that appeared
the most sensitive (FnDR systematically lower, regardless of the
number of replicates) was the moderate t-test. Based on the

analysis of both real and simulated data, the moderate t-test
thus appears to be the most reliable for finding differentially
expressed proteins in 2-DE experiments.

4 CONCLUSION

The 2-DE gel-based experiments are often used in comparative
proteomics to identify differentially expressed, or accumulated,
proteins between two or more conditions. The 2D gels classically
allow the Visualization of 50071000 proteins per gel, and replica-
tion of experiments is needed to minimize the effects of (i) bio-
logical variations in protein expression between individuals and
(ii) known technical limits such as differential protein extraction

efﬁciencies, comigration of proteins, lack of penetration of some
proteins in gels or limit of detection of the staining procedure.

Recently, different techniques based both on 2D gel (e. g. DIGE)
and gel-free (e.g. iTRAQ) techniques have been developed to
reduce these technical biases. However, it seems obvious that,
whichever technique is used, statistical analysis remains a crucial
step in the proteomics workﬂow. To date, only a few statistical
studies have been dedicated to the speciﬁc needs of proteomics,
and researchers often use the statistical tools offered in commercial
software. The statistical possibilities are restricted, and researchers
have to make decisions based only on a P— or q—value, without
knowing the details of the statistical procedure.

By contrast with proteomics, statistical tools have been widely
developed for transcriptomics applications. From a statistician
point of View, and notwithstanding different forms of data, the
problem is similar in both applications, i.e. extracting statistically
signiﬁcant expression from huge datasets. In this article, we took
advantage of many freely available open source statistical tools
developed for transcriptomics, evaluated their performance to
analyze both real and simulated 2-DE proteomics datasets
and developed an R-package adapted to the speciﬁc needs of
proteomists.

This R-package, called ‘prot2D’, is freely available as part of
Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org) and includes functions
implementing all the methods used in the present article. The
Qt method, the FDR calculation method and the moderate
t—test, that were shown in this article to be the best compromises
to analyze proteomics data, are preset in the package with the
optimal parameters we determined. For the FDR calculation
mode, method from Benjamini and Hochberg and method
from Strimmer were shown to be efﬁcient and appropriate for
2-DE volume data.

In all, as statistics is one of the most determining step in the
comparative proteomics workﬂow, and paradoxically, one of the
less studied to date, we hope that this new package will help
improving future 2-DE-based proteomics studies.

Abstract

Summary: Visualizing and summarizing data from genomic studies continues to be a challenge.
Here, we introduce the GenVisR package to addresses this challenge by providing highly customiz—
able, publication—quality graphics focused on cohort level genome analyses. GenVisR provides a
rapid and easy—to—use suite of genomic visualization tools, while maintaining a high degree of flexi—
bility by leveraging the abilities of ggplot2 and Bioconductor.

Availability and Implementation: GenVisR is an R package available via Bioconductor (https://bio
conductor.org/packages/GenVisR) under GPLv3. Support is available via GitHub (https://github.

 

com/griffithlab/GenVisR/issues) and the Bioconductor support website.

1 Introduction

The continued development of massively parallel sequencing tech—
nologies has led to an exponential growth in the amount of genomic
data produced (Kodama et (11., 2012). This growth has in turn
enabled scientists to investigate increasingly large, cohort—level gen—
omic datasets. Generating intuitive visualizations is a critical compo—
nent in recognizing patterns and investigating underlying biological
properties in cohorts under study. A significant bottleneck exists,
however, between data generation and subsequent visualization and
interpretation (Good et (11., 2014). Additionally, generating
publication—quality figures for effective communication of these
data typically requires ad [706 methods such as manual creation or
extensive graphic manipulation with third party software. This pro—
cess is both time intensive and difficult to automate/reproduce.
Further, the absence of software supporting multiple species can
make this process even more demanding. Here, we present
GenVisR, a Bioconductor package to address these issues. GenVisR
provides a user—friendly, ﬂexible and comprehensive suite of tools
for visualizing complex genomic data in three categories (small

variants, copy number alterations and data quality) for multiple spe—
cies of interest.

2 Visualization of small variants

The identification of small variants (SNVs and indels) within a gen—
omic context is of paramount importance for the elucidation of the
genetic basis of disease. Numerous tools and resources have been
created to identify variants in sequencing data (Wang et (11., 2013).
Conversely, few tools exist to visually display and summarize these
variants across sample cohorts. Given a gene of interest, it is often
useful to view variant occurrences in the context of the translated
protein product (Zhang et (11., 2012). A variety of options exist to
achieve this; however tools that offer both automation and ﬂexibil—
ity to perform this task are lacking (Supplementary Table S1)
(Griffith et (11., 2015; Leiserson et (11., 2015; Nilsen et (11., 2012; Yin
et (11., 2012; Zhou et (11., 2015). The function lolliplot was developed
to allow for precise control over visualization options (Fig. 1A).
This includes the ability to choose Ensembl annotation databases for

3 Visualization of copy number alterations

Copy number alterations occurring within the genome are impli—
cated in a variety of diseases (Beroukhim et al., 2010). The function
GenCov illustrates amplifications and deletions across one or more
samples in a genomic region of interest (Fig. 1C). A key feature of
GenCov is the effective use of plot space, especially for large regions
of interest, via the differential compression of various features (in—
trons, exons, UTR) within the region of interest. For a broader view
the function chiew plots copy number calls, and the corresponding
ideogram, for an individual sample at the chromosome level. The
function cnSpec displays amplifications and deletions on a still
larger scale via copy number segments calls. This information is dis—
played as a heat map arranged in a grid indexed by chromosomes
and samples. Alternatively, anreq displays the frequency of samples
within a cohort that are observed to have copy number gains or
losses at specific genomic loci. In addition to copy number changes,
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) often plays an important role in gen—
omic diseases. For example, in acute myeloid leukemia copy neutral
LOH has been associated with shorter complete remission and
worse overall survival (Gronseth et al., 2015). The function lthpec
displays LOH regions observed within a cohort (Fig. 1D) by plotting
a sliding window mean difference in variant allele fractions for
tumor and normal germline variants.

4 Visualization of data quality

In genomic studies, the quality of sequencing data is of critical im—
portance to the proper interpretation of observed variations.
Therefore, we provide a suite of functions focused on data quality
assessment and visualization. The first of these, covBars, provides a
framework for displaying the sequencing coverage achieved for tar—
geted bases in a study (Fig. 1E). A second function, compIdent, aids
in the identification of mix—ups among samples that are thought to
originate from the same individual (Fig. 1F). This is achieved by dis—
playing the variant allele fraction of SNPs in relation to each sample.
By default, 24 biallelic ‘identity SNPs’ (Pengelly et al., 2013) are
used to determine sample identity.

5 Example usage

GenVisR was developed with the naive R user in mind. Functions are
well documented and have reasonable defaults set for optional param—
eters. To illustrate, creating Figure 1B was as simple as executing the
waterfall function call on a standard MAF (version 2.4) file contain—
ing variant mutation data and choosing which genes to plot:

genes = C(“PIKS’CA”, “TP53”, “USHZ”, “MLL3”, “BRCAI ”)

GENVISR::WATERFALL(X = MAF_FILE, PLOTGENES:GENES)

The MAF file format originally developed for The Cancer
Genome Atlas project (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2008) is the default file format accepted by waterfall. This format
was chosen based on its simplicity and accessibility. A number of re—
sources exist to convert VCF files common to most variant callers to
MAF format. In the interest of maintaining ﬂexibility, the waterfall
and other GenVisR functions are able to accept alternative file types
as input.

6 Conclusion

GenVisR provides features and functions for many popular genomic
visualizations not otherwise available in a single convenient package

(Table S1). By leveraging the abilities of ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009) it
confers a level of customizability not previously possible. Virtually
any aspect of a plot can be changed simply by adding an additional
layer onto the graphical object. Thus, GenVisR allows for publica—
tion quality figures with a minimal amount of required input and
data manipulation while maintaining a high degree of ﬂexibility and
customizability.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Traditionally, microarrays were almost exclusively used
for the genome-wide analysis of differential gene expression. But now-
adays, their scope of application has been extended to various gen-
omic features, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), proteins and DNA
methylation (DNAm). Most available methods for the visualization of
these datasets are focused on individual platforms and are not cap-
able of integrativer visualizing multiple microarray datasets from
cross-platform studies. Above all, there is a demand for methods
that can visualize genomic features that are not directly linked to
protein-coding genes, such as regulatory RNAs (e.g. miRNAs) and
epigenetic alterations (e.g. DNAm), in a pathway-centred manner.
Results: We present a novel pathway-based visualization method
that is especially suitable for the visualization of high-throughput
datasets from multiple different microarray platforms that were used
for the analysis of diverse genomic features in the same set of
biological samples. The proposed methodology includes concepts
for linking DNAm and miRNA expression datasets to canonical signal-
ling and metabolic pathways. We further point out strategies for dis-
playing data from multiple proteins and protein modiﬁcations
corresponding to the same gene. Ultimately, we show how data
from four distinct platform types (messenger RNA, miRNA, protein
and DNAm arrays) can be integratively visualized in the context of
canonical pathways.

Availability: The described method is implemented as part of the
InCroMAP application that is freely available at www.cogsys.cs.uni-
tuebingen.de/software/lnCroMAP.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst generation of microarray platforms was developed as a
high-throughput technique for proﬁling the transcriptome of di-
verse biological systems (i.e. cells, organs or organisms) under
various experimental conditions (Schena et al., 1995; Golub
et al., 1999). To date, a plethora of different microarray platforms
are readily available. These include gene-centred platforms that
rely on current genome annotations and unbiased tiling arrays
that interrogate large non-repetitive regions of the genome.
Diverse types of platforms have been speciﬁcally designed for
the interrogation of different genomic features, ranging from

messenger RNA (mRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) transcripts,
through proteins or protein modiﬁcations, to relevant functional
elements, such as exons, single-nucleotide polymorphisms or pro-
moters (Hoheisel, 2006). In addition to arrays serving for the
quantiﬁcation of global gene expression on the RNA or protein
level, also epigenetic modiﬁcations, such as DNA methylation
(DNAm), can be monitored on a genome-wide level using micro-
array technology (Schumacher et al., 2006).

Microarray datasets are typically not only inspected on the
level of individual genes, but rather differential gene expression
in the context of groups of functionally related genes. For
instance, the overrepresentation of genes related to the same
biological process or involved in the same pathway is investi-
gated by using statistical tests (e. g. Fisher test or hypergeometric
test) or gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005).
Traditional overrepresentation analysis methods require ﬁxed
sets of up- or downregulated genes that are usually deﬁned
with fold-change and/or P—Value cut-offs. Modern gene set en-
richment analysis-like methods, in contrast, do not require
cut-offs to detect sets of functionally related genes showing a
trend towards differential gene expression (Markowetz, 2010).

As a result of pathway enrichment, a list of signiﬁcant path-
ways that contain genes with strong differential expression is
returned. To obtain more details about this result (e.g. which
genes are up- or downregulated within a pathway), suitable Visu-
alization methods are required.

Several tools exist for the Visual inspection of datasets from
individual platforms (see Gehlenborg et al., 2010, for some ex-
amples). As the first microarrays were mostly limited to mRNA
transcripts, the majority of these Visualization tools are still
focused on mRNA datasets. However, the current inventory of
publicly available tools, which are capable of integrating and
jointly Visualizing data from multiple microarray platforms, is
still limited.

Although for genomic features, which are not directly linked
to genes (such as DNAm or single-nucleotide polymorphism
data), region-based Visualization methods [e.g. the UCSC
genome browser (Kent et al., 2002)] are commonly used, data
from gene-centred genomic features (mRNAs, proteins, . . .) are
often Visualized using network-based Visualization methods [e. g.
Cytoscape (Cline et al., 2007) or KEGG Atlas (Okuda et al.,
2008)]. Although the former approach may provide more de-
tailed information about individual genes or genomic loci, con-
clusions about higher order mechanisms can often be more easily
drawn from a pathway-based View of the data. Thus, we propose
to ﬁrst focus on pathways relevant to the studied phenomenon,
which can be identiﬁed using enrichment analysis methods.

Subsequently, network hubs or key regulators can be inspected
in more detail using complementary region-based Visualization
methods.

Here, we introduce a method for integrated pathway-centred
Visualization of datasets, generated from the same biological
samples using different microarray platforms, which monitor
complementary genomic and epigenomic features.

In recent years, diverse tools were developed, which are spe-
cialized in pathway analysis (e.g. Ingenuity) or pathway Visual-
ization. Some of these tools offer Visualizing experimental data in
a pathway [e.g. KegArray (Kanehisa et al., 2006), Pathline
(Meyer et al., 2010), GenMAPP (Salomonis et al., 2007) or
MGV (Symons and Nieselt, 2011)]. For this purpose, the experi-
mental data are typically mapped to a colour gradient and dis-
played in the background colour of the pathway nodes.
GenMAPP or MGV even have capabilities to display multiple
colours in a single node (e.g. for the Visualization of time-series
experiments). MGV goes one step further and offers additional
features to put profile plots or heatmaps inside nodes. However,
all of these tools are not able to handle data from genomic
features that have no direct reference to the genes in a pathway
(e.g. miRNAs or genomic regions). Furthermore, none of these
tools offers Viable solutions that are tailored for the integration
of multiple datasets obtained from heterogeneous microarray
platforms.

2 METHODS

Before visualization, the microarray datasets of interest have to be pre-
processed and annotated using platform-specific workﬂows (Smyth,
2004; Lépez-Romero, 2011). These workﬂows usually involve (i) the
quality control of the raw data (Kauffmann et al., 2009), (2) the data
normalization to correct for background noise and experimental vari-
ation (Lim et al., 2007) and (iii) the mapping of probes to genes or gen-
omic regions. After these preprocessing steps, the microarray data have to
be exported in tabular format. These tables have to contain the following
two types of columns: (i) annotation columns, containing probe or pro-
beset IDs (e.g. Affymetrix IDs) and database IDs of the corresponding
genes (e.g. Ensembl or Entrez IDs) and (ii) data columns containing
either fold-changes or P-values resulting from basic statistical analysis
of the microarray data.

The pathway data are automatically imported from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2006).
In the KEGG PATHWAY database, each pathway map is available for
download as a document in the KEGG Markup Language (KGML)
which is internally converted into a graph structure by InCroMAP. To
overcome limitations of the KGML format, one can create an overlay
graph that shows the original KEGG pathway image in the background,
which may provide the user with additional information about cellular
structure and compartmentalization. Relevant pathways can be deduced
by a gene set enrichment analysis or simply by manually choosing any
pathway to visualize.

After importing the data, the KEGG pathway nodes, which corres-
pond to genes or gene families, can be overlaid with fold-changes mea-
sured on mRNA or protein expression level. Furthermore, DNAm
changes observed in the proximal promoter regions can be visualized.
In the ﬁnal step, additional nodes corresponding to miRNAs can be
added to the pathway and coloured according to the expression changes
measured in the underlying experiment. See Figure 1 for an illustration of
all the aforementioned visualization steps.

2.1 Pathway Visualization

The basic prerequisite for generating a pathway-based visualization is
visualizing the pathway itself. For this purpose, we are using
KEGGtranslator (see Wrzodek et al., 2011), which performs a basic con-
version of the KEGG KGML documents to GraphML. In short,
KEGGtranslator converts all KGML entries to nodes and all relations
to edges. Compounds are depicted by small circular nodes, genes or pro-
teins are rectangular-shaped nodes and group nodes are used to illustrate
complexes or families. The original layout, given in the KGML docu-
ment, is used to position all nodes. Then, all nodes are annotated with
diverse identiﬁers [e.g. Entrez Gene identiﬁers (Maglott et al., 2005)],
descriptions and further information. The resulting document provides
the basis for the subsequently generated visualizations.

At least for some pathways, the KGML document available at KEGG
does not contain all information that is depicted in the corresponding
pathway map. Thus, an overlay graph can be generated which contains
the original pathway map as a static transparent image in the background
of the interactive graph plot (Fig. 1b). By using the given x and y coord-
inates together with height and width of each interactive node, it is pos-
sible to match each node exactly on the background pathway picture.
However, to allow a clear distinction between the actual pathway in the
foreground and the pathway background picture, the background picture
should be brightened by at least 70%. Owing to this optional feature,
additional information on cellular structure (e.g. schematic drawings of
receptors involved in cell signalling) can be maintained.

2.2 Visualization of mRNA expression data

As mRNA expression data are typically available for the whole genome
and thus also for the majority of nodes in a particular KEGG pathway,
these data are displayed in the background colour of the nodes.

As input, our method requires preprocessed mRNA datasets with an-
notation columns (e.g. gene identiﬁers) and data columns, which are
referred to as observations. In this context, observations can be any stat-
istical signiﬁcance (e.g. P-values) or comparative measure (e.g.
fold-changes or log-ratios).

Next, these data have to be broken down to a single value for each
pathway node, which then determines the colour of the node. As single
nodes can represent multiple genes in KEGG, the intensities measured by
probes, corresponding to the same node, have to be summarized. To this
end, either the mean or median is calculated across these probes, or the
probe with the strongest or most signiﬁcant signal (i.e. min P-value or
max [fold-changel) is decisive for colouring the node. Among others, the
InCroMAP application provides all of these summarization methods.

To visualize fold-changes or log-ratios in the context of pathways, a
colour gradient ranging from blue through white to red is used to illus-
trate down- and upregulation. Non-differentially expressed genes are
shown in white, and pathway nodes for which no mRNA data are avail-
able are displayed in grey. If desired, P-values can be shown instead of
fold-changes. For this purpose, we decided to map the negative logarithm
of the P-values to a colour gradient, which leads to a more intuitive
illustration of the observed signiﬁcances. See Figure 10 for an example
of visualized mRNA data.

2.3 Visualization of protein expression data

Visualization of protein datasets is performed by adding small boxes
below pathway nodes and changing the colour of the boxes according
to the corresponding protein expression data. As state-of-the-art experi-
mental techniques (e.g. reverse-phase protein arrays, quantitative mass
spectrometry) facilitate the distinction between different protein modiﬁ-
cations (e.g. phosphorylated or acetylated forms of proteins), multiple
measurements may correspond to the same gene (Pirnia et al., 2009;
Yates et al., 2009). In this particular case, the expression change observed
for each individual protein form is represented as a separate box below

the corresponding node. Each of these boxes is then labelled according to
the respective protein form and coloured based on the underlying expres-
sion data, as described previously for mRNA datasets. We require pro-
tein datasets to be annotated with database identiﬁers referring to
proteins or genes (e.g. Entrez Gene IDs), which allows us to perform a
straightforward mapping to pathway nodes. For protein modiﬁcation
datasets, we further require a column, determining the actual modiﬁca-
tion for every protein.

2.4 Visualization of DNAm data

DNAm microarrays are similar to tiling arrays and contain many probes
that can be assigned to a single gene. But visualizing the signal levels of all
probes assigned to a certain gene in one pathway node would clutter the
picture and reduce the clarity of it. For DNAm in gene promoters, it is
most important to know whether there are methylation changes and
whether the promoter is rather hyper- or hypomethylated. The methyla-
tion details can then be inspected manually later (e.g. the InCroMAP
application provides a detailed XY plot of the DNAm if one clicks on
a pathway node, see Fig. 2).

Therefore, the DNAm status, observed in the proximal promoter of a
gene, is summarized and graphically represented by adding boxes to the
left side of the pathway nodes. These boxes are drawn on a white back-
ground and contain a grey bar that stretches from the middle to the left,
in the case of hypomethylation, and from the middle to the right to
indicate hypermethylation. Instead of discriminating between hyper-
and hypomethylation, one can simply visualize the amount of differential

methylation. In this case, the grey bar would stretch from the left border
of the box to the right border.

The length of the grey bar is proportional to a summary value reﬂect-
ing the DNAm status of the promoter of a certain gene. This value is by
default computed from the probes in a region ranging from —2000 bp
upstream of the transcription start site to 500 bp downstream.

For mRNA expression arrays, the summarization of probes corres-
ponding to the same transcript is usually achieved by the median polish-
ing algorithm (see Wu and Irizarry, 2005), which effectively alleviates the
inﬂuence of outlier probes. However, this algorithm is only applicable
under the assumption that ideally the probe intensities are evenly distrib-
uted along transcripts. This assumption does not hold true for the
DNAm of promoter regions, as the probe intensities are not expected
to be evenly distributed along the region. Furthermore, outlier probes,
corresponding to DNAm peaks, are mostly not because of probe-speciﬁc
effects, but rather reﬂect a local change in the DNAm pattern, which may
be biologically meaningful. A method to overcome this issue is the de-
tection and visualization of maximum peaks within the DNAm data.

For peak detection, Nimblegen proposed two algorithms that are
called ‘windowed threshold detection’ and ‘second derivative peak detec-
tion’. A detailed description of these methods can be found in the user’s
guide of Nimblegen’s SignalMap software (see NimbleGen Systems Inc.,
2006). In addition to those sophisticated peak detection methods, one can
also approximate peaks by using simple methods, such as picking the
probe with maximum differential methylation (i.e. max Mold-changel).
As an alternative to visualizing peaks derived from the probe-level
fold-changes, one can also use a statistical approach to estimate the

Fig. 2. Integrated visualization of datasets from four different platforms in the KEGG ‘Cell Cycle’ pathway. In general, colours reﬂect fold-changes,
where red means upregulated and blue means downregulated. White indicates a fold-change of zero and darker colours correspond to stronger
differential expression. The colour of each node itself reﬂects the mRNA fold-change, for example, Ttk shows a strong upregulation and Smcj’ is
downregulated. Smaller boxes below nodes show the protein and protein modiﬁcation expression. For example, we visualized three different forms of
TRP53: a phosphorylation at the serine 15 (SIS) site, which shows almost no expression change, a modiﬁcation of the S9 site, which is upregulated, and
the basic protein itself, which is also upregulated. The grey boxes on the left of the nodes represent the maximum DNAm fold-change peak. A bar to the
left indicates hypomethylation and a bar to the right hypermethylation. In our example, Ttk shows a strong hypermethylation. All aforementioned genes
are highlighted in yellow. miRNAs are added as small triangles to the pathway and are connected with a grey edge to their mRNA targets. The colour of
the miRNA nodes reﬂects the fold-change, as described for the mRNA nodes

differential methylation in a promoter region. For this purpose, we pro-
pose to divide the promoter region r into segments b1, . . . , b”, each con-
taining a ﬁxed number of probes. For each segment, a statistical test (e.g.
ordinary or moderated t-test) can be used to detect differential methyla-
tion between two experimental groups. An overall signiﬁcance value s can
then be computed from the P-values P(b1, . . . , P(b,,) using the formula
s 2 £221 — log(P(b,-)). This binning approach has the advantage of
being sensitive to local changes in DNAm, as promoter segments with
signiﬁcant changes in DNAm are highly weighted. Conversely, segments
for which slight changes were observed only contribute marginally to the
overall signiﬁcance score.

InCroMAP, by default, approximates the peak by selecting the probe
with maximum differential methylation. It further supports other options,
such as the given formula s to process P-values and simple options that
include mean, median, minimum and maximum. If multiple genes are
associated to one node, all probes are pooled together and the summar-
ization method is applied. By default, this will lead to a visual represen-
tation of the maximum peak contained in any gene that is represented by
a node.

The purpose of this visualization technique is giving researchers a hint
if and how many methylation changes are present in a gene promoter.
For more details, the genomic location of individual peaks can be visua-
lized in a DNAm proﬁle plot (see Fig. 2). To this end, the fold-changes
observed for the probes covering the promoter region of a certain gene
are plotted along their genomic coordinates. This depiction is particularly
useful for comparing the DNAm proﬁles and peaks found for different
observations (i.e. sample groups).

To relate the DNAm data to data from gene-centred microarrays (e.g.
mRNA expression arrays), each probe needs to be mapped to a gene.
Thus, we require annotation columns containing the chromosome and

the genomic position of each probe to facilitate the mapping from probes
to genes.

2.5 Visualization of miRNA expression data

Visualizing miRNA datasets in the context of KEGG pathways is not
straightforward, as these pathways do not contain miRNAs a priori.
Therefore, to incorporate the data into a pathway, a connection must
be established between the miRNAs and the protein-coding genes in the
pathway.

A simple approach for putting miRNAs in context would be inspecting
the gene locus of the miRNAs. This approach already led to some valu-
able results, for example, the detection of a strong co-regulation within
the genomic DLKl locus (Luk et al., 2011). But this approach is not
suitable for linking the miRNAs with genes in a pathway. First, genes
from neighbouring loci are not generally co-regulated. Second, a pathway
shows, for example, how a signal is processed within a certain organism.
The genes in a pathway are usually functionally related or represent regu-
latory relationships. Hence, when adding new nodes to a pathway, the
relation should also be made based on functional or regulatory
relationships.

As the common mechanism of miRNAs involves the binding to com-
plementary mRNA transcripts (Bartel, 2004), we propose to link
miRNAs to their known target mRNAs. These target mRNAs can be
obtained from diverse databases, which contain experimentally veriﬁed
targets [e.g. miReoords (Xiao et al., 2009), miRTarBase (Hsu et al., 201 1),
TarBase (Papadopoulos et al., 2009)] or predicted miRNA targets (re-
viewed in Alexiou et al., 2009). We used a union of the three aforemen-
tioned experimentally veriﬁed miRNA target databases for the ﬁgures in
this publication.

Wsualization of cross-platform microarray data

 

Based on a map containing all connections between miRNAs and their
target mRNAs, the miRNAs monitored in a speciﬁc experiment can be
added to a pathway of interest as small triangular nodes, which have
outgoing edges to the pathway nodes corresponding to their target
mRNAs. The triangular miRNA nodes are coloured according to their
expression, as described previously for mRNA datasets. This leads to an
integrated visualization of a pathway, overlaid with miRNA and mRNA
expression data, and extended with putative miRNAimRNA inter-
actions. Figure lf shows an example result of the described procedure.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this work, we present a novel methodology for the combined
Visualization of DNAm data and mRNA, (phospho-) protein
and miRNA expression data in the context of canonical path-
ways. This methodology involves strategies for mapping the data
from heterogeneous platform types to a common functional
element, namely, a gene, embedded into a pathway which regu-
lates higher order cellular functions or processes. Furthermore,
we propose Visualization techniques that are particularly suited
for displaying quantitative data from diverse genomic features in
an integrated graph plot, which represents a metabolic or signal-
ling pathway of interest. However, generating a joint Visualiza-
tion of epigenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data is
challenging, as each data type has its own characteristics.

For proteomics data, we propose to map basic and modiﬁed
proteins to their common source gene and draw each protein
form as a separate box below the pathway node representing
the source gene. Using this kind of Visualization, one can, for
instance, determine the activation state of a protein by compar-
ing the colour (i.e. expression state) of the box corresponding to
the basic form with the one that corresponds to the phosphory-
lated form.

In brief, for most mRNA expression datasets, it is sufﬁcient to
annotate the probesets with appropriate gene identiﬁers to link
the data with the pathways of interest. For miRNA datasets, this
linkage is complicated by the fact that miRNAs are normally not
contained in pathways. miRNAs are known to have a regulatory
function by binding to complementary mRNA transcripts
(Bartel, 2004). These interactions are documented in public data-
bases, which we use to extract interactions between miRNAs and
their target mRNAs. Using this information, one can add the
miRNAs to the pathways and connect them to the existing nodes
by inserting edges to the corresponding targets.

The probe design of DNAm microarrays is typically not gene-
centred, but is region based. Thus, in contrast to gene-centred
arrays, the probes are not organized in probesets, which were
designed speciﬁcally for the same gene. Instead, these arrays
cover speciﬁc genomic regions of interest, for instance gene pro-
moters. The connection to protein coding genes is usually estab-
lished by deﬁning a region around the transcription start site of a
gene and assigning all probes in this region to the gene.

However, the Visualization of every probe would vastly reduce
the clarity of the Visualization; therefore, a summary method is
required. For DNAm changes, calculating a mean is often in-
appropriate because small peaks in a promoter region can al-
ready have a large inﬂuence on gene regulation. One of the
summarization methods we consider advisable is the detection

Fig. 3. Integrated visualization of the ‘MAPK signalling’ pathway with a
detailed View of DNAm in the proximal promoter of ngr. The grey
DNAm bar next to the ngr gene in the pathway plot stretches from the
middle to the right of the box, which indicates strong hypermethylation.
The length of the grey bar corresponds to the height of the maximum peak
of the red curve. This curve displays the probe-level fold-changes plotted
along the promoter region of ngr. The light blue curve shows the DNAm
proﬁle of ngr, observed in another sample group

and Visualization of maximum peaks, as it is sensitive to local
changes in DNAm.

Alternatively, if the data are properly normalized and
smoothed (i.e. probe specific effects are alleviated), one can
also take the probe with maximum differential methylation to
approximate the peak. Nevertheless, every summarization
method has its limitations. The maximum peak methods are def-
initely less robust against probe-specific effects, and the results
may be inconclusive as a single positive peak may suggest hyper-
methylation of a region, while the majority of the promoter is
clearly hypomethylated. On the other hand, if mean probe-level
fold-changes are computed across larger regions, there is a higher
chance that localized differential methylation is erased.

An example for a KEGG pathway with Visualized mRNA,
miRNA, protein and DNAm data can be seen in Figure 3.
The Visualization of multiple heterogenous datatypes cannot be
performed with either a loss of information or a loss of clarity.
As these integrated pathway Visualizations should provide an
overview, rather than a detailed listing of all possible informa-
tion, we tried to keep the clarity and summarize information
wherever possible.

At first glance, it always seems to be desirable putting as much
information as possible into the pathway. For example, it would
be possible to create small XY plots of promoter regions for
every gene and add these pictures as small icons below each
node. Other possibilities include the creation of heatmaps or
Visualization of multiple timepoints with various colours in a
single node. But, especially if multiple datasets are Visualized
together in a pathway, it is important to summarize things and
to not overload the whole picture. The main purpose of a
pathway-based Visualization is not to replace all other analysis
and Visualization methods, but rather giving a general overview
that helps researchers to further analyse their data.

4 IMPLEMENTATION AND AVAILABILITY

The described methods are implemented in InCroMAP, a tool
for integrated analysis of cross-platform microarray and
Pathway data. InCroMAP is a JavaTM application that provides
an interactive, user-friendly and easy-to-use graphical user inter-
face and is freely available under the LGPL version 3 license
from www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/InCroMAP. The
application can import all aforementioned data types, is able to
automatically download and layout KEGG pathways and apply
all described Visualization methods on those pathways. The re-
sulting graphs can be exported as JPG, GIF, TGF, GML or
GraphML. Furthermore, many options are provided that con-
trol, for example, the mapping of expression values to a continu-
ous colour gradient and allow for customization of the generated
cross-platform pathway Visualizations.

5 CONCLUSION

Pathway enrichment analysis is a common microarray data ana-
lysis tool to discover pathways, whose genes show signiﬁcant
expression changes. In most applications, these enrichments are
endpoints in analysis workﬂows. There are some methods or
applications that can show pictures of signiﬁcantly altered path-
ways, and a few applications can even change node shapes or
colours according to a single expression dataset. However, not
only the amount of available microarray datasets is growing rap-
idly but also the number of available platforms. At present,
microarray platforms exist for proﬁling diverse genomic features,
as for instance mRNAs, miRNAs, proteins and promoter re-
gions. However, the current repertoire of analysis and especially
Visualization methods that are speciﬁcally designed for the ana-
lysis of cross-platform datasets is still limited.

Here, we present a pathway-based cross-platform microarray
Visualization method that can, for example, be used to inspect
relevant pathways detected by pathway enrichment analyses.
Especially the Visualization of DNAm and miRNA datasets is a
feature that cannot be found in other Visualization approaches. By
integratively Visualizing all datatypes, it helps researchers to dis-
cover potential relationships across multiple layers of gene regu-
lation. For example, the hypomethylation of a promoter may
cause the upregulation of a miRNA, which may in turn down-
regulate the corresponding target mRNA, whereupon a connected
pathway protein could change its expression or activation state.
Such complex cascades of effects, which involve multiple levels of
gene regulation, can be deduced from the pathway images gener-
ated by the here presented Visualization method.

of potential targets that may play a pivotal role in biological
response to the drugs and other active chemicals, as well as the
discovery of new hit compounds with similar pharmacology pro—
ﬁles but novel scaffolds. Moreover, ChemMapper can also be
useful in the application of drug repurposing, as well as investi—
gation of potential side effects related to the drugs and other
active chemicals.

2 METHOD
2.1 Data set-up

The polypharmacology information for the bioactive compounds and
biological annotations of the corresponding targets was gathered from
various public databases, including ChEMBL (ChEMBL 14), DrugBank
(version 3.0), BindingDB (December 2012), KEGG (May 2011) and PDB
(November 2010). The chemicaliprotein interaction annotations were
categorized as follows: protein name, UniProt access ID, species, biolo-
gical functions, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (molecular function
and biological process involved) and activity data. Other non-annotated
chemical structures are also incorporated for virtual screening from
public databases like ZINC. The ﬁnal database consists of nearly
350 000 molecular entries annotated for >20 000 proteins and >3 million
compounds for virtual screening. Multiple 3D conformers were pre-gen-
erated for each compound to facilitate 3D similarity calculation
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 Similarity metrics

ChemMapper uses SHAFTS as the 3D similarity calculation method.
SHAFTS adopts a hybrid similarity metric combined with molecular
shape and colored (labeled) chemical groups annotated by pharmaco-
phore features, which is designed to integrate the strength of pharmaco-
phore matching and volumetric overlay approaches. Previous studies
proved SHAFTS is more efﬁcient and accurate in ligand-based virtual
screening than the common 2D ﬁngerprint-based similarity and other 3D
similarity methods (Liu et al, 2011; Supplementary Material).

3 WEB INTERFACE

ChemMapper accepts a chemical structure (sketched online or
uploaded in multiple chemical structure ﬁle formats) as the query
and provides two types of online calculation services: Target
Navigator and Hit Explorer. The input 2D structure will be
automatically converted into single 3D conformer. In the
Target Navigator mode, the users are allowed to search either
bioactive compound collections with corresponding target infor—
mation (ChEMBL, DrugBank and BindingDB) or chemical sub—
strates from the KEGG enzyme database. The results table can
be filtered, re—ordered and grouped in terms of various rules
(Supplementary Fig. Sla). A list of potential protein targets is
returned ranked by the inference of chemicaliprotein association
network whose edges weighed by the bioactivity of the similar
compounds to the query (Supplementary Fig. Slb). The biolo—
gical annotations for each target, including name, species, func—
tion and involved pathway, are displayed as well (Supplementary
Fig. Slc). In the Hit Explorer mode, only the most similar com—
pounds from various public chemical repositories to the query
are returned, which presumably exhibit similar bioactivity or
function. Alternatively, the users are able to upload their

customized mini—database (in sdf or mol2 format) for virtual
screening by 3D similarity calculation. In both mode, the overlay
poses between the query and each target compound can be visua—
lized. All the information in the result table can be downloaded
in Comma Separated Values (csv) format as well. Two test cases
(polypharmacology effect of loratadine and scaffold—hopping for
EGFR inhibitors) relevant to the two modes are described in
detail in the Supplementary Materials.

Comparing with 2D fingerprint—based similarity calculation,
3D similarity calculation is slower: a typical query to the
ChEMBL (339 624 entities) in ChemMapper takes 12724h. A
monitoring page is provided for bookmarking to redirect to
the result page as the job ﬁnishes.

4 CONCLUSION

The goal of ChemMapper is to provide an online versatile frame—
work for fast exploring the target pharmacology and chemical
relationship via molecular 3D similarity methods. ChemMapper
links bioactivity and target protein annotation data associated to
small molecules to chemical 3D similarities, which can lead to
novel perspectives and new applications to the old drugs and
suggest new associations between the chemical and pharmaco—
logical spaces.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: As next generation sequencing is rapidly adding new
genomes, their correct placement in the taxonomy needs verification.
However, the current methods for confirming classification of a
taxon or suggesting revision for a potential misplacement relies on
computationally intense multi-sequence alignment followed by an
iterative adjustment of the distance matrix. Due to intra-heterogeneity
issues with the 16S rRNA marker, no classifier is available for
sub-genus level, which could readily suggest a classification for
a novel 16S rRNA sequence. Metagenomics further complicates
the issue by generating fragmented 16S rRNA sequences. This
article proposes a novel alignment-free method for representing
the microbial profiles using extensible Markov models (EMMs) with
an extended Karlin—Altschul statistical framework similar to the
classic alignment paradigm. We propose a log odds (LODs) score
classifier based on Gumbel difference distribution that confirms
correct classifications with statistical significance qualifications and
suggests revisions where necessary.

Results: We tested our method by generating a sub-genus
level classifier with which we re-evaluated classifications of 676
microbial organisms using the NCBI FTP database for the 16S
rRNA. The results confirm current classification for all genera while
ascertaining significance at 95%. Furthermore, this novel classifier
isolates heterogeneity issues to a mere 12 strains while confirming
classifications with significance qualification for the remaining 98%.
The models require less memory than that needed by multi-
sequence alignments and have better time complexity than the
current methods. The classifier operates at sub-genus level, and
thus outperforms the naive Bayes classifier of the RNA Database
Project where much of the taxonomic analysis is available online.
Finally, using information redundancy in model building, we show
that the method applies to metagenomic fragment classification of
19 Escherichia coli strains.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many different techniques have been proposed for microbial
Classiﬁcation. Most current approaches for Classiﬁcation are based
on similarity between the organism to be Classiﬁed and known
correctly Classiﬁed organisms. This similarity may be based on
cell shape or structure, biochemical Characteristics, G + C content,
nucleic acid hybridization, etc. More recent techniques have been
based on molecular sequence comparisons. Lilburn et a1. (2006)
presents an excellent review of available tools for microbial
Classiﬁcation and emphasizes that currently available tools are not
satisfactory. He argues for more algorithmic approaches.

Due to the ubiquitous nature of 16S rRNA, it is often used as the
sequence for comparison. Sub-genus Classiﬁcation is considered a
Challenge due to lack of resolution if only the 16S rRNA is used. Use
of alternate gene markers and whole genomes have been suggested
(Case et a1., 2007; Dahllof et a1., 2000), but 16S rRNA still retains
its position as the most commonly used marker (Janda and Abbott,
2007). In fact, we show that only a small percentage of organisms or
strains (2%) require markers and methods outside of the 16S rRNA.

A common Characteristic of most sequence-based Classiﬁcation
techniques is the requirement for sequence alignment that is
extremely computationally expensive. Initial taxonomy evaluations
were done with heat-maps generated using distance matrices from
multiple sequence alignments (Lilburn and Garrity, 2004). The
alignments and tools have been recently improved using RNA
secondary structures and probabilistic models in Cole et a1. (2009);
however, reliance on subjective selection of gene copies and
expensive sequence alignment may be avoided with alternative
methods. This is exactly what we do in this article. Our approach
uses all copies of 16S and completely avoids alignment while still
achieving high Classiﬁcation accuracy at the species level.

Statistical signatures (Vinga and Almeida, 2003) created from
base composition frequencies offer an alternative to using Classic
alignment. These alignment free methods reduce complexity and
processing. Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity (Otu and Sayood, 2003)
and EMM-based distance measures (Kotamarti et a1., 2010) look
promising for whole genome phylogenies as the current methods do
not scale well. However, it is desirable to avoid a resource intense
all against all distance measurement in a fast growing taxonomy.
Hidden Markov model-based proﬁles offer a solid probabilistic
basis (Eddy, 1998) and their application is well tailored to DNA or
protein analyses. However, the base model needed to be extended
for RNA. The later extensions account for co-variability of base
pairs in the RNA sequences due to Watson—Crick complementarity

(Eddy and Durbin, 1994). Eddy notes that the covariance models
are more suited to small length RNAs (e.g. tRNAs ) and as such for
homologous search problems.

This article proposes the use of extensible Markov models
(EMMs; Dunham et a1., 2004) to create compact Classiﬁcation
models for sequence analysis as a more efﬁcient alternative to
any previous sequence-based technique. Use of machine learning
allows EMM signatures to be automatically built. By completely
avoiding alignment, the efﬁciency is greatly improved. The resulting
EMM models (one per Class) provide a compressed representative
(signature) of the Class.

EMM (Dunham et a1., 2004) is a time-varying Markov Chain,
which can be viewed as a directed graph with nodes representing
Clusters of real-world events and arcs representing the ordering
of the associated events. EMMs have been used to model many
different applications in a variety of ﬁelds including future state
prediction (Meng and Dunham, 2006) and rare event detection
(Meng et a1., 2006). As a bioinformatic adaptation of an EMM,
EMM bioinformatic analysis (EMMBA) transforms m molecular
sequences to a single EMM signature of 111’ states. It can be
considered a representation of sequence data with states representing
Clusters of similar sequence segments and inter-state transition
probabilities representing the implicit order within the sequences.

The salient features of our Classiﬁcation approach include:

0 High Classiﬁcation accuracy [based on Bergey’s Manual
(Garrity et a1., 2005)] even at the species level.

0 Creation of a new EMM to create Proﬁle graphs (Kotamarti
and Dunham, 2010) for each species using all of its 16S rRNA
copies.

0 No alignment of sequences is required. A quasi alignment is
obtained as a direct byproduct of the EMM graphs themselves.

The quasi-alignment technique also makes EMMs suitable for
Classiﬁcation using metagenomic sequences.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 derives
an equivalent Markov formulation of sequence learning. Section 3
describes the method used to conﬁrm or question the Classiﬁcation
of an organism and introduces an extension to the Karlin—Altschul
statistics in order to incorporate a log-odds (LODs) score matrix
to aid in statistical defense of a Classiﬁcation. In Section 4, 10-
fold cross-validation tests, comparison to RNA database project
(RDP) Classiﬁer and sub-genus Classiﬁcation results are presented
to illustrate the performance of EMM. Finally, Section 5 presents
ﬁiture direction for EMM and concludes the article.

2 MODEL CONSTRUCTION

The occurrences of letters or base compositions (A, C, U, G} of
an RNA sequence provide frequency information. The occurrences
of all patterns of bases of length 1 generates an l-mer frequency
representation for a sequence (Vinga and Almeida, 2003).

We use the notation F (S) to represent a transformation ﬁinction
acting on m 16S rRNA sequences of an organism and G=(V,E)
representing a directed graph of V nodes and E edges. The vertices
are also referred to as nodes and states of the EMM graph to improve
readability. Mathematically, EMM generation can be expressed as

G’=G@F(S) (1)

Fig. 1. The model building process. NSVs constitute the numerical
representations of equal-sized segments along a 165 sequence, which are
used in building an EMM signature. Signature building starts with a start
state; as each NSV is processed, it is compared to the existing states of the
model. If the NSV is not found to be close enough (per a squared Euclidean
threshold) as in the case of NSV 1, a new state (1) is created with the new
NSV as its ﬁrst cluster member; otherwise, the new NSV (as in the case of
NSV 3) is simply added to the matching cluster state node (state 1). When
all NSVs are processed, the model building process is ﬁnished.

Where U-J is the operator to integrate new sequence segments into
a model being built. F (S) is ﬁirther expressed in terms of nested
functions F ’ and F * as follows:

F(S) = <F’(S1),F’(S2),...,F’(Sm)> (2)
F/(Si) = <F*(S(i,1)).F*(S(i,2)).---.F*(S(i,k))> (3)
F*(S(i’k)) = <Vgﬁk’1),VU,k’2),...,V(i’k,n)> 

In Equations (2)—(4), the functions F, F ’ and F * are numerical
summarization functions that convert molecular sequences to
oligomer count form. The function F collects m 16S rRNA
sequences S being transformed and applies the F ’ transformation
function. The ﬁinction F ’ converts a single sequence to k equal-
sized segments and applies the function F * on each segment S i. The
function F * converts a sequence segment to a vector v of counts with
each count representing one of the oligomer variants. Such vectors
are referred to as Numerical Summarization Vectors (NSVs) and the
size of an NSV is given by 4], where 1 is oligomer length.

Finally, U-J extends the directed graph, i.e. sequence signature
as shown in Figure 1, by Clustering each NSV generated by the F
function into a new or an existing node of the graph and appropriately
updating the are information. Initially, the signature graph is empty.
A squared Euclidean distance ﬁinction dist and a threshold 1' are
utilized to determine Clustering of NSVs in a node. The ﬁinction U-J
can be ﬁirther expressed by the following algorithm:

given that the V vertices of EMM graph also represent the nodes
of Clusters of similar NSVs and with VC representing the current
state, for each NSV v.- in F(S),

(1) Find the Closest match, i.e., the nearest node  to the NSV vi.
(2) If dist(Vj,vl-) > 1',

(a) add a new node Vl- =Vi,

(b) add a new are from V6 to V.- and

(C) update EMM current state VC = Vi, else

(3) Add NSV v.- to the node  = VjU{vl-}, update the frequency
of the arc V6 to  and set the EMM current state as VC =

Quasi-alignment methods

 

where the Closest match, referred to as quasi alignment, which
is deﬁned to exist when the node whose centroid is at a minimal
distance from the NSV v.- is found. The threshold 1' is selected such
that segments which are very similar are Clustered together. The
current state of an EMM graph is always the last-matched node. The
current state Changes when a new NSV matches to another state or
results in creation of a new state. An arc is added/updated whenever
the current state Changes. Adding an arc involves updating the arc
probability. The state resets to the start state for every new sequence.

Figure 1 shows the EMM build operation graphically. In this
section, we formulated the EMM build operation as a transformation
problem, which is suitable for compressing sequences into a
signature. The transformation function U-J is a compression function.
Considering m sequences of k segments each, there are mk data
points. Suppose an EMM is built with L states. Due to Clustering,
mk f L. Typically, we Choose Clustering criterion such that mk << L,
which results in compression.

Aggregation of EMMs into a single EMM called proﬁleEMM
is how the signatures for higher taxa such as genus or class are
created. For each EMM that is to be aggregated to a proﬁleEMM,
the centroids of nodes, which are simply the average vectors of
the NSVs assigned to them, are used as input NSVs for the model
building. For example, if a species EMM has 20 states, there will
be 20 average vectors used as NSVs for building a higher level, i.e.
genusrnodeL

3 METHODS

In recent decades, several effective taxonomic analysis techniques have been
proposed and are in use. Lilburn and Garrity, 2004 present a heat-map
Visualization technique that examines and corrects for any inconsistencies
in the microbial taxonomy. The process has been recently improved in the
areas of alignment and sequence selection (Cole et a1., 2009). The central
process for generating the heat-map is described as follows:

(1) Pick the longest 16S rRNAs for a genome with the most conserved
homologue positions.

(2) Perform multiple sequence alignment for all the representative 16S
rRNA sequences at those positions.

(3) Pick a pairwise distance estimation method and create a distance
matrix.

(4) Apply hierarchical clustering to generate heat-map Visualization for
the resulting phylogenetic taxonomy.

Alignment-free methods exist that can compute a reasonable distance
matrix (Kotamarti et a1., 2010; Otu and Sayood, 2003). The former
requires more computational resources to exhaustively determine short
unique substrings, but the latter is faster, works more efﬁciently, avoids
the single copy selection issue by combining them and also provides a
valid distance metric. Once a distance matrix is available, the algorithm
Self Organizing Self Correcting ( SOC C) can automate the process of spotting
and correcting for taxonomic errors; however, this is easily done in case of
EMM by directly considering the ranked list of models.

In later publications (Garrity and Lilburn, 2005), the manual process
of Visual examination for taxonomy errors was substituted with a more
automatic, iterative distance matrix manipulation. The algorithm SOSC uses
a statistical basis to shufﬂe elements of the distance matrix in a multi-pass
scheme to reorganize sequences into similar clusters. The ﬁnal step of heat-
map generation and Visualization is replaced with an iterative distance matrix
manipulation algorithm. Using the data mining direction taken by Garrity
and Lilburn (2005), we propose building classiﬁcation models instead of
relying on computing an all-against-all distance matrix. By utilizing EMM

signatures of the 165 sequence proﬁles of organisms, we prevent discarding
potentially useful copies of the 16S rRNA thus eliminating the subjective
sequence selection process. Furthermore, we propose a Markov transition
probability-based classiﬁcation rank score aided by reports of statistical
signiﬁcance to assess the taxonomy. The task of assessing membership
involves considering each member, measuring its degree of membership in a
potential host community represented as a proﬁleEMM, and then calculating
its statistical signiﬁcance. A member may either be an individual organism
with all its copies of 16S rRNA or a higher taxon such as genus. Highlights
of the proposed method are:

(1) Evaluate a taxon against all of the communities to which it could
potentially belong, which generates a rank order.

(2) Consider the highest ranking community as the best classiﬁcation for
the taxon.

(3) A taxonomic anomaly is identiﬁed if the highest ranking community is
not consistent with the observed placement in the published microbial
taxonomy (Garrity et a1., 2005).

Next, formal notation will be given for the above. Given an EMM e,,
as a member taxon signature to be classiﬁed against one of T communities
represented by EMMs e,, where t: 1,2,  the evaluation of eq against
a proﬁleEMM of e, is given by the function r(eq,e,), where r computes a
rank measure. The proﬁleEMM e,/ with the highest rank is considered the
community to which eq belongs. We will introduce the terms diﬁ‘erence score
and transition presence probability to explain classiﬁcation. The former is
derived as the sum of differences in individual LOD scores of states when a
match is found between a query state and a model state. The latter implies a
non-zero value if the model includes a transition arc that connects matched
state and the current state.

The classiﬁcation is represented by the notation t’ as follows:

t’ =argMax { te{1,2,...,T}|r(eq,e,)} (5)

where r(eq,e,) measures how similar e,, is to the e, as below

(6)

1
19111—1

r(e ,e,)= —
q 1+ k:0 (S(sk,s;{)ln(P(sk,s;{)))

where S (sk,s;{) and P(sk , s2) represent the difference score and the transition
presence probability, respectively, for the quasi alignment <sk,s,’C > which
is deﬁned as a pair of member-model states with the least-squared Euclidean
distance. The value for a transition probability is 1, if the arc <s;{_l,s;C >
is present in the proﬁleEMM e,. If there is no such arc, a penalty
value —ln(1/|e, |) is used. The denominator computes the score adjusted
to highlight the difference in a quasi alignment and the rank measure
function generates higher values for smaller difference scores. Scoring quasi
alignments and computing P-Values are described next.

Karlin and Altschul (1990) proposed a LODs score for scoring alignments
along with a theorem supporting a Gumbel extreme value distribution of LOD
scores. Extending the KarliniAltschul statistics, quasi alignments can also be
scored with LOD scores by use of dynamically built score matrices for each
EMM signtaure (Kotamarti et a1., 2009). This has become necessary since the
alignment basis used in Karlin and Altschul (1990) deals with a substitutive
environment, where the aligned base pairs that are different constitute a
substitution. Since EMM uses the count form of bases and not the bases
directly, its quasi-alignment context deals with comparing numerical vectors
of oligomer counts and the EMM score matrix reﬂects the LOD scores for
occurrences of speciﬁc oligomer patterns. Kotamarti et a1. (2009) describes
an algorithm for dynamically building a score matrix for each proﬁleEMM
and adjusting it in the context of a member taxon to compute the key Gumbel
distribution parameters such as A and K. The algorithm is quite involved and
the reader is referred to earlier work by the authors (Kotamarti et a1., 2009);
a brief summary of it is presented here for completeness:

(1) Create LOD score matrix for each model.

R.M.Kotamarti et al.

 

(2) Adjust the scores when assessing membership using the individual
probabilities of the bases in a member’s sequence(s).

(3) Fit a Gumbel distribution by computing the parameters A and K using
numerical methods at http : //www.ncbi .nlm.nih . gov/
IEB/ToolBox/C_DOC/lxr/source/tools/blast . G.

Let vk and v2 be the numerical vectors of a quasi alignment (closest
squared Euclidean match) <sk,s;C >. Let X be a score matrix, i.e. a score
array of size |vk |. The scoring of quasi alignments is computed as a difference
score (1,, [k], which is the weighted Manhattan distance, where k = 1,2,  |eq|
and |eq| is the number of states in the member EMM e,,, as follows:

le1
quk] = Z (Xj |((Vk)j — (Vi)j)|) (7)

jzl

where j loops over all oligomer combinations (64 for a 3-mer basis) and 
is the LOD score for j-th pattern. For example, for a 3-mer basis, a pattern
like ‘ACU’ is associated with a numeric value in the vectors as (vk)j, (v2)!-
and 

The difference scores obtained from scoring quasi alignments are then
assessed for signiﬁcance. Once again, referring to the KarliniAltschul
statistics, P-Value is computed using the Gumbel distribution framework.
However, unlike in classic alignment scoring of local alignments where
perfect alignments generate maximum scores, quasi-alignment statistics of
using difference scores generate scores around zero for near alignments.
Using p. and 0' to represent mean and SD, when samples are drawn
from two different distributions (111,01) and (112,02), the difference
distribution formed from the differences of samples is characterized

by (11d :11] —p.2 and Ud=,/012+a%) (Yates and Moore, 2007). When
samples are drawn from the same distribution, the resulting mean of the
difference distribution becomes zero and the variance is doubled in value as
characterized by (11,1 20,0.) 2m). KarliniAltschul statistics for classic
alignment are interested in the one-sided tail probabilities because perfect
alignments do not follow the null hypothesis of randomness. In fact, the high
scoring local alignments fall outside a conﬁdence threshold in the right-side
tail. However, in our case, difference scores could fall on either side of
zero and the tail probability supporting the alternate hypothesis becomes
one minus the area under the cumulative distribution function corresponding
to the interval —a’ and +a’, where a’ = |a',,[i]| of the difference distribution.
Adapting KarliniAltschul P-Value, given K , N as the distribution parameters
and |eq| representing the number of quasi alignments, we get the following:

-1/(+d) _ eK‘eq‘e—A/(—d)

P/-Value=1—(eKle‘ile )where A, =k/x/2

The smallest difference score among those of all quasi alignments is
the best base line P-Value for the member. This, however, can be further
improved to take into account other signiﬁcant alignments as well. Given a
95% conﬁdence interval, the quasi alignments with a’ 5d, are considered
signiﬁcant where (1, corresponds to the 5% threshold in the difference
distribution characterized by 11:0 and A’. We propose the following
adaptation of the KarliniAltschul statistics to obtain a P-Value for the
difference distribution.

P’-Value=1—(e_y2 25:01 yg n! —e—Y1 25:01 y’, n!) (8)

where y; =K|eq |e_)‘/(+‘I) and y] =K|eq |e_)‘/(_‘I). h is the number of quasi
alignments that are signiﬁcant. If 1121 indicating that there is only one
signiﬁcant quasi alignment, the P-Value reverts to Equation (1). Though
normal distributions are most popular, we opted to use the difference
Gumbel distribution due to the conservative P-Values it appears to generate
(Kotamarti et a1., 2009).

Each evaluation by rank measure function generates several data points
for closer analysis in the event of unexpected classiﬁcation that is required
for revisions in taxonomy. The values reported include 1—P-Values, E-
Score, BitScore, inverted difference score, the best quasi alignment that is
the alignment with the smallest difference score and the total number of

quasi alignments that exceed 95% conﬁdence threshold. The E-Score and
BitScore are analogs for the 1—P-Values for an outcome (Ian Korf et a1.,
2003).

Our proposed method for taxonomy veriﬁcation requires the use of all
available relevant genomic data, which is typical of a taxonomic classiﬁer; as
such, to eliminate bias, we will include a 10-fold cross-validation experiment
in Section 4 which systematically separates the training and the test sets in
assessing the predictive power of EMM. Besides conﬁrming a taxonomic
placement with a statistical signiﬁcance declaration, our proposed method
identiﬁes ambiguities in taxonomy.

4 EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS

In this section, we comparatively analyze the introduced methods
using the 16S rRNA sequences. Since the distance matrix method
is the primary basis on which the Bergey’s manual is maintained,
we will exclude this method in the comparison to eliminate bias
in Classiﬁer accuracy. Any deviations from the Bergey’s manual
are identiﬁed as possible candidates for revision. Due to space
limitations, only the highlights of genus and sub-genus level EMM
LODs Classiﬁer are described; authors present a detailed 10-fold
cross-validation example for EMM-based Classiﬁcation of microbial
strains into phylogenetic Classes in Kotamarti et a1. (2009). The
16S rRNA database utilized in this analysis is derived from the
NCBI Microbial Complete Genome Database at http://www.ncbi
.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi. The sequences were extracted
from the annotated whole genome sequence ﬁles using keyword
searches. From these data, a new database was built that consists of
individual ﬁles, one per microbial organism, in FASTA format. The
original dataset was derived from the NCBI as of August 2009 and
consists of 782 organisms each with multiple 16S sequences where
applicable. There were several cases of missing genus or even Class
information. Since this type of information is used for verifying the
topological accuracy, such data are used only for testing unknown
sequence detection. The ﬁnal database consisted of 676 organisms.
For comparison, we considered the legacy Clustering-based method
of using the heat-map/SOCC method and a leading Classiﬁcation
method based on a naive Bayes Classiﬁer. Figure 2 summarizes the
three methods including EMM with regards to operations performed
in preprocessing, training and analysis (conﬁrm/deny) phases. The
space and time complexities are summarized in Figure 3. Our
approach only takes 0(MK2) for space and 0(N+NK+M2) for
time, N is the number of sequences, M the number of models
(or Classes) and K the number of equal-sized segments. These are
much less than the prevailing methods. Details are provided in
Supplementary Material.

We performed ﬁve experiments, using l=3, i.e. 3-mer pattern
for generating counts, to validate our approach. Selection of 1 :3
was found to be sufﬁcient for taxonomic veriﬁcation and triplets
are convenient when working with DNA sequences as well, as they
map to amino acids. The experiments are: (i) perform 10-fold cross-
validation for Classiﬁcation of organisms into genera of the phylum
Proteobacteria and comparatively analyze Classiﬁcation errors for
known/unknown sequences; (ii) Classify all genera and species of
the existing microbial taxonomy; (iii) Classify strains of Bacilli;
(iv) Classify E. coli fragments; and (v) compare EMM and LZ
complexity methods for phylogeny. The results and descriptions
follow:

of 5 classes, 129 genera and 351 organisms. EMM signatures are ﬁrst
generated for all the genera of the phylum, and then also for all the
organisms using all the available 16S rRNA copies. As expected,
space efﬁciency is achieved as shown in Figure 4. Second, the
dataset is randomly divided into 10 partitions. Third, leaving one
partition at a time as the test partition, the remaining nine partitions
are used as the training data from which models for genera are
generated. Next, the test partition, i.e. the organismal signatures
from the test partition are evaluated against all the models and
the best Classiﬁcation is generated. Misclassiﬁcations are counted
and those for which no models exist are discarded. We found
the classiﬁcations to match 84% on average for genus and 100%
for class. Figure 5 shows the accuracy breakdown by each of the

legacy clustering method requires sequence selection and multi-sequence
alignment in the preprocessing stage, while the other methods require count
generation of l-mers. For the naive Bayes classiﬁer 8-mer is used, and for
the EMM method 3-mer is used . The sequence selection step is not required
for EMM because all sequence copies are utilized in creation of an EMM
signature, whereas in other cases only select copies that pass select criteria
are used.

is the length of a sequence, N is the number of sequences, M is the number of
models (or classes) and K is the number of equal-sized segments. Multiple
sequence alignment is by far the most expensive operations in space and
time. Naive Bayes classiﬁer (Wang et a1., 2007) uses an 8-mer, which could
theoretically require 48 feature attributes, but optimal design is assumed
due to lack of detailed information. Reduced space complexity of 0(MK)
for EMM is possible in case of classiﬁcation algorithms since transition
information is not used.

10-fold runs. Also shown is the comparative analysis between the
naive Bayes Classiﬁer (Wang et a1., 2007) and the EMM classiﬁer in
Figure 5 using three partitions representing worst, best and moderate
performance by EMM. The partitions were structured into multiple
ﬁles of required format prior to using the naive Bayes classiﬁer
implementation of the RDP 2.2 classiﬁer. Unlike EMM, the original
distance matrix and the RDP Classiﬁer methods require selection of
a single 16S rRNA copy among the many found in some strains.
To the best of our knowledge, these selection procedure details are
not published; as such, we used a random selection when selecting
a single copy. The misclassiﬁcations for both initially also counted
the cases where there is no model for the genus being classiﬁed.
Lack of models for some is due to low cardinality of a particular
genus as it is very common to encounter a genus with a single
member only. Therefore, if a single member genus is in a test
partition, there would be no corresponding training model and the
best a classiﬁer could do is to ﬁnd the closest one which would
still count as a misclassiﬁcation. Errors due to lack of models
are adjusted and the remaining Classiﬁcation errors, also shown,

identifying potential areas of concern in the existing taxonomy.

are analyzed further as follows. Figure 5 also shows the genera
that are found as misclassiﬁed by either method or both. It is
interesting to note that EMM ﬁnds a more reasonable classiﬁcation,
justiﬁable using DNADIST-based distance, for both Geobater and
Haemophilus strains than suggested by the RDP classiﬁer as well as
Bergey’s manual. It is equally interesting to point out that there
are signiﬁcant local alignments between Rizhobium strains and
the near cousin Ochrobactrum though a global-aligned DNADIST
analysis conﬁrms Bergey’s manual. Since any taxonomy is simply
based on the convention chosen and not necessarily reﬂective of
a particular biological fact of interest, the current separation of
the two Rizhobium strains and Ochrobactrum remains interesting.
Unlike, the RDP classiﬁer, normalized LOD scores used by EMM in
identifying such areas of interest is perhaps useful. We will consider
how both methods handle unclassiﬁed sequences next which is
useﬁil for classifying sequences from strains for which the complete
genome is yet to be determined.

We added 17 test strains from several archaea and bacteria phyla to
analyze classiﬁer response. The EMM classiﬁer reported a zero base
P’-value for 12 of them indicating immediate conclusion that the
sequences are of unknown origin. When the same was tested with
the RDP naive Bayes classiﬁer, only the best possible matching
taxa are reported since the training set does not include any of
the test phyla. This means that RDP classiﬁer operation did not
appear to detect novel sequences. On the contrary, the EMM LODs
classiﬁer provides a modiﬁed rank ﬁinction output which detects
the novel sequences 100% though the P-value derivative appears
to detect 70% only. However, when they were input to the online
RDP classiﬁer, the correct classiﬁcations were determined. This is
most probably due to the fact that the training set for the online
version already includes all known and available sequences. From
a taxonomic classiﬁcation stand point, it is a common practice to
build models with all the available genomic information and provide
a query service for sequences known or unknown as input by a user.
This is exactly the case with the RDP classiﬁer that works based
on the existing classiﬁcations and the models. However, it does not
handle sub-genus classiﬁcation. We take this useful concept to sub-
genus level in the following experiments where all the available 16S
rRNA information is used in building the classiﬁcation models.

Experiment 2: classiﬁcation of all genera and species.
Since sub-genus levels are considered difﬁcult to differentiate and
the naive Bayes classiﬁer available online at Ribosomal Database
Project 2 does not classify below genus level, we extended our test
to verify species level in addition to the genus of the published
microbial taxonomy. The EMMs are built ﬁrst for all genera, species
and strains. Evaluation of each strain against all available species
models generated high-ranking classiﬁcations. Of these, all strains
were classiﬁed correctly for genus level. With the exception of 12
strains, all strains were also classiﬁed under the correct species.
For all correct classiﬁcations, we found them to be signiﬁcant at
95%. Table 1 shows that the 12 misclassiﬁcations are, in fact, due to
presence of exact copies of the 16S rRNA sequences. For example,
the strains Bordetella parapertussis 12822 and B. bronchiseptica
RB50 have the identical set of 16S rRNA sequences and as such both
species models attained the ﬁrst rank position for them resulting in
ambiguity.

Experiment 3: classiﬁcation of Bacillus strains. Of all
microbial classiﬁcations, identifying the exact species of a strain

However, all species could not be conﬁrmed due to presence of exact copies of the 16S

share one or more exact 16S rRNA sequences making their classiﬁcation ambiguous.

is the most difﬁcult. Typically, wet-lab techniques and/or multi-
locus methods are used. However, we extended our experiment to
classiﬁcation of Bacillus strains and found that it was successful
for 17 out of 20 Bacillus strains. The remaining 3 are of Bacillus
anthracis type: Ames-Ancestor, Ames and Sterne, which share
one or more exact copies of the 16S rRNA making identiﬁcation
ambiguous at the strain level.

Experiment 4: classiﬁcation of sequence fragments. In all
experiments so far, we have used all available 16S rRNA sequence
data. This test involves testing a single fragment of one of the gene
copies of the 16S rRNA. Since EMMs are built using segmented
sequences of ﬁxed size, ﬂexible segment boundaries that allow
overlapping was utilized. Overlapped segments result in redundant
counting of l-mers since two successive segments are the same
except that the second one is shifted by a base pair. This helps
in ﬁnding the quasi alignment between a fragment starting at
any position and an EMM during the evaluation step. We believe
this to be ideal for handling the well-known binning problem in
metagenomics. However, true alignment-free metagenomics will
require EMMs built for all the available relevant sequence data.
This is deferred as ﬁiture research. For this test, strain models
are re-generated as parent models with overlapped segments. The
fragments are created by taking a 16S rRNA sequence of each of
the 19 E.coli organisms and discarding the ﬁrst 500 bp of the ﬁrst
16S rRNA sequence. The remaining ~1000 bp are segmented as
80 bp and multiple of these 80 bp segments are used to create a test
fragment. These fragments were evaluated and all were correctly
classiﬁed against their species, i.e. E.c01i. Depending on the location
of the fragment, the accuracy ranged between 70% and 100%.
Experiment 5: alignment-free phylogeny. LZ complexity-
based phylogeny (Otu and Sayood, 2003) and the EMM counter
part (Kotamarti et a1., 2010) methods were compared using 20 strains
(92 16S rRNA sequences) of the most diverse phylum Burkholderia.
While both methods generate the same phylogeny, the EMM method
completed in <5 min, whereas the LZ complexity method took
over 8min to generate the distance matrix. Whole genome level
comparison remains to be done.

5 CONCLUSON

In this work, we expanded on the alignment-free alternative to
using classic alignment methods and statistics in sequence analysis.
With the goal of improving data representation and complementing
classiﬁcation with signiﬁcance, we explored proﬁle models for
predicting microbial taxonomy.

Though 16S rRNA is the marker of choice for the majority of
microbial classiﬁcation, its heterogeneity, due to multiple copies of
the gene, usually requires a method to select some and discard others
based on some criteria. Our proposed sequence analysis approach
uses all the available sequence copies of 16S rRNA of a microbial
organism by reducing similar sequence regions into fewer nodes
in the model. In this work, we showed that a compact model that
includes the complex intra—sequence order can be built using an
EMM (Fig. 1). Such compact models are called EMM signatures
and transforming organisms with all their 16S rRNA sequences to
EMM signatures creates a signature library. The library can then be
used for homology assessment within each taxa hierarchy to derive
member signiﬁcance.

Four experiments were carried out to demonstrate the space
compression and classiﬁcation accuracy down to strain level.
In all, except the lowest classiﬁcation levels, i.e. species and
strain classiﬁcations, the current classiﬁcations and those by our
method are in perfect agreement. We showed, for species level,
12 ambiguities that occur due to the heterogenity issues of the
16S rRNA; however, achieving 98% accuracy (Table 1) with
identiﬁcation of ambiguities that require multi-locus methods is
reasonable. Furthermore, same technique applied at strain level, i.e.
when diagnostic identiﬁcation is attempted, either identiﬁes a single
strain or a small number of strains that share one or more exact
copies of the 16S rRNA. The rank function output offers feedback
for immediate correction in case of taxonomic placement errors,
which could auto-update proﬁle models thus eliminating the need
for a distance matrix-based correction. Future work will address this.

Several approaches for curative analysis of microbial taxonomy
based on the 16S rRNA are in existence, but all of them either
require extensive multi-sequence alignment and/or do not use all
of the available sequence information. Yet, new approaches are
emerging proposing the use of the whole genome (Otu and Sayood,
2003) and/or other markers such as RecA, RPOB, 23s rRNA, etc.,
(Case et a1., 2007; Dahllof et a1., 2000) in order to improve clarity
across species. We have shown in our article that by using improved
statistical signature methods, classiﬁcation, signiﬁcance analysis
and homology assessment can be performed effectively with less
memory and computation.

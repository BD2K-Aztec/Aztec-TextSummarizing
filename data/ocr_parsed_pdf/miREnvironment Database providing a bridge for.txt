ABSTRACT

The interaction between genetic factors and environmental factors
has critical roles in determining the phenotype of an organism. In
recent years, a number of studies have reported that the dysfunctions
on microRNA (miRNAs), environmental factors and their interactions
have strong effects on phenotypes and even may result in abnormal
phenotypes and diseases, whereas there has been no a database
linking miRNAs, environmental factors and phenotypes. Such a
resource platform is believed to be of great value in the understanding
of miRNAs, environmental factors, especially drugs and diseases.
In this study, we constructed the miREnvironment database, which
contains a comprehensive collection and curation of experimentally
supported interactions among miRNAs, environmental factors and
phenotypes. The names of miRNAs, phenotypes, environmental
factors, conditions of environmental factors, samples, species,
evidence and references were further annotated. miREnvironment
represents a biomedical resource for researches on miRNAs,
environmental factors and diseases.

Phenotypes of an organism are determined by the complex
interactions between genetic factors and environmental factors.
Environmental factors contribute a lot to the formation and
development of many diseases, especially complex diseases
including cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Catania et (11., 2009;
Chow et (11., 2010; Das, 2010; Soto and Sonnenschein, 2010). A
number of databases for coding-gene and environment associations
have been developed (Kitsios and Zintzaras, 2010; Mattingly et (11.,
2006; Turner et (11., 2010). Furthermore, they have provided great
helps in biomedical researches. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one
Class of newly identiﬁed genetic factors, which mainly repress
the expression of genes at the post-transcriptional level (Bartel,
2004). miRNAs play critical roles in various biological processes,
including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, development
and apoptosis (Esquela-Kerscher and Slack, 2006). Dysfunctions

of miRNAs are thus associated with various diseases (Lu, 2008).
Like other genetic factors, it has been reported in recent years that
miRNAs also have complex interactions with a wide spectrum of
experimental factors including stress (Gidron et (11., 2010), drugs
(Lima et (11., 2011), virus (Lin and Flemington, 2011), alcohol
(Ladeiro et (11., 2008), Cigarette (Izzotti et (11., 2010), air pollution
(Jardim, 2011), radiation (Niemoeller et (11., 2011), diet (Alisi et (11.,
2011) etc. These interactions have crucial roles in many phenotypes
including diseases. The studies on experimental factor and miRNA
associations are becoming increasingly important in biomedical
sciences. Therefore, a database linking miRNAs, experimental
factors and phenotypes becomes emergently needed but is still not
available.

To meet such need, we searched the PubMed database for
literature that matched this study by the union of two keyword
sets. One keyword set is ‘miR or miRNA or microRNA’,
which ensures that literature about miRNA study is retrieved.
The other keyword set contains a list of experimental factors
(Supplementary File 51). We further manually curated miRNAs
and environmental factors that have associations. The researchers
read the original references and manually summarized the
data. The condition of environmental factors, treated samples,
species, the details of associations and the reference PubMed
ID are also manually retrieved. The data are further manually
standardized and annotated. Items (i.e. miRNA genes) that
cannot be standardized or annotated are represented by ‘n/a’.
Furthermore, different researchers double Checked the data including
miRNAs environmental factors, conditions of environmental
factors, phenotypes, evidences describing the relationships among
miRNAs, environmental factors and phenotypes, and references.
Based on above data, we constructed the miREnvironment database.
As a result, miREnvironment integrated >2500 entries including
~800 miRNAs, ~260 experimental factors, ~180 phenotypes, 17
species from ~370 publications. Human, mouse and rat are the
top three species that have the greatest numbers of entries. They
represent 98% of the total entries (Fig. 1A). We also list the
statistical details for data of human, mouse and rat (Fig. 1B). The
database also provides hyperlinks to the original references in NCBI
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for each entry.

All data were organized in the ‘miREnvironment’ database using
SQLite, a lightweight database management system. The website is
presented using Django, a Python web framework and is available
at http://Cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/miren. miREnvironment contains
pages for browsing, searching, submitting and downloading.

miREnvironment provides several search options such as names of
the miRNAs, environmental factors and phenotypes.

The miREnvironment database houses a manually curated
collection of experimentally supported interactions of miRNAs,
experimental factors and phenotypes in > 15 species. We believe that
miREnvironment will not only be useful for bioinformatics analysis
but also for the scientists who are interested in miRNA function and
disease, medicine and pharmacology. However, miREnvironment
represents the ﬁrst step in this project and further extensions will
be developed. We will try to annotate the environmental factors in
more details. For example, the drugs will be linked to some drug
resources, i.e. DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca/). By linking to
DrugBank, the users can easily know the features of interested drugs,
such as chemical formula and structure, etc. It is also useful to
incorporate the dysfunctional protein-coding genes for entries at the
same experimental conditions as the miRNAs have. Furthermore,
some analysis tools are being developed and will be integrated into
miREnvironment in the future. For example, we are developing tools
to identify new disease indications for FDA-approved drugs, the so-
called drug repositioning (Sirota et (11., 2011). The drug—miRNA
interaction represents a novel dimension of information to drugs,
and is expected to be useﬁil in drug repositioning. We plan to
continuously update the miREnvironment.

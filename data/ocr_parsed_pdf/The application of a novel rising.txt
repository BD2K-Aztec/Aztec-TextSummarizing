Abstract

Motivation: Syndromic surveillance is the real—time collection and interpretation of data to allow
the early identification of public health threats and their impact, enabling public health action. The
'rising activity, multi—level mixed effects, indicator emphasis’ method was developed to provide a
single robust method enabling detection of unusual activity across a wide range of syndromes,

nationally and locally.

Results: The method is shown here to have a high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (99%) compared
to previous methods, whilst halving the time taken to detect increased activity to 1.3 days.

Availability and implementation: The method has been applied successfully to syndromic surveil—
lance systems in England providing realistic models for baseline activity and utilizing prioritization

rules to ensure a manageable number of 'alarms’ each day.

1 Introduction

Syndromic surveillance is the near real—time collection and inter—
pretation of data to allow the early identification of potential
public health threats and their impact, enabling public health ac—
tion (Triple, 2011). Syndromic surveillance fulfils part of Public
Health England’s (PHE) role to give early warning of potential
threats to public health due to infectious disease; and to quantify
any impact (or reassure about the absence of impact) on public
health during mass gathering or following major environmental
incidents.

Within PHE, syndromic surveillance is co—ordinated by the Real—
time Syndromic Surveillance Team (ReSST). ReSST monitors general
practitioner (GP) consultations using an in—hours syndromic system
(GPIHSS), currently covering about 61% of the registered GP patient

population in England, and a GP out of hours and unscheduled care
system (GPOOHSS) (Harcourt et (11., 2012), covering about 76% of
the provision in England. GPIHSS replaced a previous weekly system,
HPA/QSurveillance in April 2013 (Harcourt et (11., 2011). A sentinel
emergency department system (EDSSS) captures attendance data from
34 sites in England and Northern Ireland (Elliot et (11., 2012). The
NHS 111 syndromic system analyses all calls to the national tele—
phone health service, and replaced the existing NHS Direct syndromic
system (Baker et (11., 2003) in September 2013.

Data are anonymized and then aggregated from diagnostic/
symptom codes using code lists created by experienced epidemiolo—
gists. For most systems, the vast majority (over 80%) of patient con—
sultations receive a useable diagnostic code; however coding rates
can be very low (less than 5%) for a few GPOOHSS providers.

Introducing RAMMIE

3661

 

The following terms are used throughout this report:

' Signal—a measure of syndromic activity which has a speciﬁed
system, syndrome and geography. Signals are measured on a
daily basis e.g. ‘15 GP in hours’ consultations for diarrhoea in
Hackney on 2nd January 2014.’

' (Syndromic) indicator—an aggregated group of diagnostic/
symptom codes used to capture activity associated with one or
more illnesses of public health importance e.g. acute respiratory
infection, severe asthma, gastroenteritis, impact of cold weather.

' Baseline—the expected activity estimated using statistical meth—
ods for each signal.

' Thresholds—limits estimated using statistical methods with a
known probability that a daily signal be within the thresholds.

' Alarm—an indication that a signal’s value on one particular day
exceeds its upper threshold e.g. ‘GP In—hours asthma attendances
for Birmingham have a baseline of 10 and an upper limit of 18,
signal was 20, hence alarm.’

Each indicator has national, regional and local signals. Regional
signals use the boundaries of the 15 PHE Centres. Local signals use
the 152 English upper tier local authority boundaries, except for
EDSSS, which is a sentinel system and thus uses the sentinel emer—
gency department sites. The combination of syndromes and loca—
tions means that there are over 12 000 ‘signals’ to be reviewed daily
by the team.

A wide range of statistical techniques are used internationally for
syndromic surveillance (D’Errigo et (11., 2007; Tokars et (11., 2009;
Robertson et (11., 2010; Corberan—Vallet and Lawson, 2011; Xing
et (11., 2011; Lau et (11., 2012; Unkel et (11., 2012). Previously a number
of different statistical methods were used by ReSST: the NHS Direct
syndromic surveillance system used a regression model utilizing the
historical data dating back to January 2003 (Baker et (11., 2003);
HPA/QSurveillance used a standardized incidence ratio that com—
pared sub—national with national incidence rates (Harcourt et (11.,
2011); the EDSSS and GPOOH systems introduced prior to the 2012
Olympics used control chart methods (Morbey et (11., 2014).

The ‘rising activity, multi—level mixed effects, indicator emphasis’
(RAMMIE) method was developed to provide a single robust
method for all systems, including any future new data sources.
Having a single method improves interpretation of signals, with
RAMMIE designed to combine the strengths of the existing
methods.

The RAMMIE method incorporates the benefits of two types of
previously used methods; using historical data and regression mod—
els to identify whether activity is unusual for the time of year, and a
control chart type approach to identify significant recent rises in ac—
tivity. The combination of these two types of alarm, ‘historical’ and
‘spike’ for each signal gives more information to interpret potential
public health threats.

In application, the RAMMIE method needed to be robust and
computationally fast, able to review over 12000 signals daily and
cope with the following data quality issues:

' The scale of signal counts varies greatly, a national signal may
have tens of thousands of counts per day, whilst many local sig—
nals, for less common indicators like ‘meningitis’, will most days
have a zero count.

' Many syndromic indicators, e.g. inﬂuenza—like illness, have a strong
seasonal pattern, but peaks can vary unpredictably year on year.

' The volume of people accessing health care varies greatly by day
of the week, due to the closure of GP in—hours surgeries during
weekends and bank holidays.

' Syndromic systems use data that are collected for other purposes
and are subject to unforeseen changes in the relevant health care
system which can affect the volume of data or the coding. Many
syndromic systems grow over time e.g. as new emergency depart—
ment sites are added.

' Syndromic surveillance is required to identify a wide range of un—
foreseen events, varying from gradual changes in disease inci—
dence (e.g. national pertussis outbreak in England during 2012;
www.hpa.0rg.uk/NewsCentre) that may last over a year, to one—
day ‘spikes’ in syndromes caused by e.g. air pollution.

Whilst primarily concerned with events of a national importance
it is necessary to identify regional differences during an outbreak,
and increasingly help is sought in identifying the impact of regional
or local incidents (e.g. ﬂooding).This paper outlines how the
RAMMIE method has been developed and applied as a robust
method for analysing and interpreting syndromic surveillance data,
across a range of data sources, and describing initial validation
work.

2 Methods

The RAMMIE method identified activity that was either unusually
high for the time of year or had recently risen significantly, incorpo—
rating prioritization rules to ensure manageable numbers of statis—
tical alarms.

2.1 Multi—level mixed effects modelling

One of the novel aspects of the RAMMIE method was to use
multi—level modelling and benefit from the hierarchical structure of
signals, with local authorities or emergency department sites
grouped into English regions (PHE Centres) which are themselves
subsets of national signals. This method enabled signals to be mod—
elled at a local level despite sparse data by ‘borrowing strength’
from other areas.

Separate models were created for each syndromic indicator. A
Poisson or a negative binominal model was used for the count
data but, to allow for changes in data volume, an offset was used.
For GPIHSS the offset was the registered patient population of GP
practices, whilst for other systems the total daily activity was
used. Separate models were used for national, regional and local
signals, because low counts for the uncommon syndromes mean
that some models did not converge at a local or regional level. The
national signals used a negative binominal model to allow for
over—dispersion. The more complicated multi—level sub—national
models used a Poisson model that was computationally quicker to
converge.

Independent variables included day of the week, whether or not
the day was a bank holiday and month of the year. To avoid step
changes at month end, which could lead to models with a ‘saw
tooth’ appearance, each day was given a weighting based on two
months: day 16 was treated as the middle of the month with each
other day in the year contributing to two of the neighbouring month
categories, with weighted values between 0.5 and 1, summing to 1
for each day.

For GPIHSS a variable for the day after a bank holiday was
included in the models and found to be significant (with a p—value of
less than 0.05): this was to account for the increased GP activity fol—
lowing the extended closure of GP surgeries over a bank holiday.
For some systems binary coefficients were added to identify periods
when a significant change occurred, e.g. moving from NHS Direct
to NHS 111 data.

R.A.Morbey et al.

 

The formula for the three level models was expressed algebraic—
ally as follows:

log(u,-,-k) : log(total,-,-k) + ﬁg + ﬁlXiik + Mk + 11,-;a

For PHE Centre k, location (local authority or emergency depart—
ment site) j on day i. Total is the offset (as described above) and
[31 Xiik represents a vector for all the independent variables and their
coefficients, Mk represents the PHE Centre level specific random ef—
fect and 11,-;a represents the specific random error for each local area
within a PHE Centre.

Coverage varied by signal and where data were very sparse mod—
els failed to converge. A pragmatic approach was applied, signals
were only included where they had at least 365 days of non—zero
counts, therefore some indicators were only modelled at a national
or regional level.

All modelling and analysis described below was carried out using
Stata version 13, (StataCorp LP; 2013).

2.2 Historical alarm

The independent variables for the subsequent weeks were known,
being based on day of the week, month and holidays and so it was
possible to predict activity. An average of the recent totals was used
for the prediction which was then revised using the actual total on
the day data were received.

‘Historic thresholds’ were calculated using either three standard
deviations or three times the square root of the count above the
modelled mean, whichever was greater. This approach provided a
robust upper limit in order to generate ‘historical’ alarms.

2.3 Spike alarm
Occasionally a signal would remain significantly higher or lower
than modelled for several weeks, e.g. if there was a change in com—
munity incidence of a disease (e.g. during the inﬂuenza season) or
following the introduction of a new vaccine, or a change in record—
ing practices. This could lead to either the historic alarm sounding
every day or never sounding, therefore a second ‘spike’ threshold
was created to identify recent increases in activity. The spike thresh—
old was a scaled version of the historic threshold, based on how
close to the model the signal had been over the past week (the data
for the past week were weighted based on total consultations to pre—
vent any single outlier days of missing data distorting the threshold).
When data were too sparse for a local model to be calculated the
spike threshold was based on the national historic threshold, scaled
to the recent difference between total local activity and national ac—
tivity across the system.

2.4 Prioritization rules

Prioritization rules were created to prevent duplication of investiga—
tion and excessive numbers of alarms. Some indicators were more
specific subsets of a more generalized indicator, for instance, diar—
rhoea was a subset of gastroenteritis. If an alarm for a specific indi—
cator and its more general form sounded, then only the specific one
was prioritized. When seasonal illnesses, for example seasonal inﬂu—
enza or norovirus, are widespread they generated a large number of
alarms; if the increase in illness affected more than three local areas
and also resulted in a PHE Centre alarm, then only the Centre alarm
was prioritized. Similarly, if three or more Centres were affected
and there was also a national alarm then only the national alarm
was prioritized. If an increase in just one local location was suffi—
ciently large to create a Centre or a national alarm, then only the
local location was prioritized.

The season specific indicators, e.g. hypothermia were only pri—
oritized during the appropriate season.

2.5 Validation of RAMMIE method

The RAMMIE method was tested in terms of specificity, sensitiv—
ity, positive predictive value and timeliness against known ‘inci—
dents’ (Table 1). An incident was defined as a period of increased
activity detected by ReSST using previous statistical methods
and which had been additionally reported in the syndromic
surveillance weekly bulletins (https://www.g0v.uk/g0vernment/
c0llecti0ns/syndr0mic—surveillance—systems—and—analyses) or in—
ternally reported within PHE. Thus the incidents contained
increased syndromic surveillance activity between April 2012 and
July 2013, all of which had been verified by reference to other sur—
veillance systems within PHE e.g. laboratory reporting or by other
sources of outbreak reports. In addition, we defined incidents as
also including a number of widespread events that affected air
quality during the same period.

The period selected for the validation covered the time for which
historical data were available for all the current systems up to the
introduction of RAMMIE as a replacement for previous methods.
For this period, the RAMMIE method was applied retrospectively
and the resulting alarms compared with previous methods on the
same or comparable syndromic systems. The main difference be—
tween systems was for GPIHSS: prior to April 2013 the HPA/
QSurveillance system had less coverage than GPIHSS and used a
weekly data extract (except for a few months when daily data were
used for enhanced surveillance during the 2012 London Olympic
and Paralympic games).

The RAMMIE method was applied to local data for NHS Direct
which previously had only regional and national signals.

Some incidents, e.g. major industrial fires, had a clear start date
however others, e.g. a seasonal outbreak of norovirus were often
less clear. Where the start date was unknown, the start was defined
as one week prior to the first alarm by the previous methods, or two
weeks for outbreaks lasting over four weeks. The end of an incident
was defined as either one week after the final alarm created by previ—
ous methods or when levels were reported as returning to normal,
whichever was sooner.

A signal was defined as being ‘linked’ to an incident if it could
theoretically be expected to detect the increased activity, i.e. it was
in the same geographical location and was for a syndromic indicator
related to the incident.

Sensitivity was defined here as the percentage of incidents for
which an alarm is generated; when measuring sensitivity by syn—
dromic system, incidents were only included if they had at least one
potentially ‘linked’ signal.

Specificity was defined here as the percentage of daily signals not
linked to an incident that did not generate an alarm.

Timeliness was defined here as the mean number of days be—
tween the start of an incident and the first alarm.

3 Results

3.1 Multi—level mixed effects modelling

The models created proved to be robust across the wide range of
syndromes and locations tested, enabling public health surveillance
to distinguish between usual seasonal factors and changes in data
provision and potential outbreaks.

The model mirrored the weekly cycle and the seasonal winter in—
crease in upper respiratory tract infections (Fig. 1). Offsetting by
practice population enabled the model to adjust for occasional dips
in activity due to technical issues.

The daily number of NHS 111 vomiting calls in one example
PHE centre was again mirrored by the model (Fig. 2). The
RAMMIE method was able to create models even when numbers
were very low and was able to cope with sudden changes in
coverage.

3.2 Spike alarms

The combination of spike and historical alarms provided extra in—
formation to aid public health interpretation. Figure 3 shows the
number of emergency department attendances for bronchitis, along
with alarms generated by the RAMMIE method.

The first historical alarm shown in Figure 3 came after a period
when activity had been lower than expected and thus also generated
a spike alarm, the second historical alarm came after a period when
activity was already higher than expected so no spike alarm
occurred.

3.3 Prioritization rules
When applied retrospectively, the prioritization rules reduced the
number of RAMMIE alarms from a mean of 209 to 114 per day
(Table 2). Most of the reduction resulted from the rule that priori—
tized only national alarms when increased activity led to alarms in
many local areas. These rules also reduced the peaks seen at busy
times. Removing the prioritization rules would have resulted in days
with over a thousand alarms, the busiest day having 1830: with the
rules, the busiest day had 187 alarms.

Table 3 summarizes the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value (PPV) and timeliness of the different methods against incidents
detected by the previous statistical methods, by syndromic system.

3.4 Sensitivity

One of the air quality incidents (a large plastics recycling fire in the
West Midlands between June 30, 2013 and July 3, 2013) had not
generated any alarms under previous statistical methods. Using the
RAMMIE method, alarms would have been generated in the two
GP surveillance systems.

There were three incidents involving local spikes in activity that
generated alarms under the old HPA/QSurveillance system but no
associated alarms using the RAMMIE method. All the other inci—
dents detected by the previous methods would have been detected
using the RAMMIE method. The RAMMIE method increased the

ally, across the study period.

3.5 Specificity
Specificity was very high, being over or approaching 99% for every
system in England (Table 3).

3.6 Positive predictive value

Positive predictive value, (the proportion of alarms that were linked
to an incident), was not high, being 22.2% overall for the RAMMIE
method, slightly lower than for earlier methods.

3.7 Timeliness

Timeliness improved overall, halving from a mean of 2.6 days
(between the start of an incident and the first alarm) for previous
methods to 1.3 days for RAMMIE, with the majority of systems im—
proving; by 3 days for GPIHSS, 2 days for GPOOHSS and 5 days
for NHS Direct.

4 Application

In the seven months from September 2013 to March 2014, the
RAMMIE method was used over 2 million times to assess signals,
creating nearly 25 000 prioritized alarms. By April 2014 nearly
12 000 different signals were being assessed each weekday, generat—
ing on average 134 alarms a day. In October 2013 the RAMMIE
method was applied to the new remote advice service, NHS 111,
incorporating local signals for the first time to telephone call data in
England. The alarms were used to supplement the interpretation of
surveillance data published in weekly syndromic surveillance reports
to highlight trends and any findings of public health significance.

RAMMIE alarms have highlighted a number of increases in ac—
tivity that have led to alerting a potential public health impact to
colleagues within PHE, including:

' A rise in asthma indicators in September 2013.

' Increases in respiratory indicators at the beginning of April 2014
that coincided with national reports of poor air quality associ—
ated with pollution and dust from the Sahara.

5 Conclusions

The RAMMIE method has proved to be a reliable and effective
method for generating automated alarms for syndromic surveillance.
The multi—level models have enabled local models to be created for
the first time across all systems. The method is able to cope with the
wide range of data volume and seasonal variation in activity. The
prioritization rules reduce duplication by emphasizing the most im—
portant signals and help to keep alarms to manageable levels. New
surveillance systems incorporating new data sources have been
incorporated into RAMMIE with a minimum of extra development
work, as could future potential data sources for syndromic
surveillance.

The ability to automatically analyse thousands of signals and
identify and prioritize those with increased activity improves the sur—
veillance team’s ability to detect outbreaks and potential rises in syn—
dromes of public health concern. Having a single method for all
syndromic systems and a combination of ‘historic’ and ‘spike’
alarms also aid interpretation of the surveillance.

One potential limitation of this approach is that all automatic—
ally generated alarms could be seen as equally important, whereas a
national alarm is likely to be of more concern than a local alarm,
which may involve a small number of patients. It should be noted
that the generation and prioritization of statistical alarms is only the
first stage in a public health risk assessment process used by ReSST.
Further work is planned to publish the other stages of this risk
assessment.

By using incidents defined as those statistical increases identified
previously, there may be a bias in favour of the previous methods.
Despite this, RAMMIE was able to maintain high specificity whilst
improving timeliness and system sensitivity. It is inevitable that the
positive predictive value should be considerably less than 100%, due
to the large number of signals covering a wide range of syndromes
across many locations. Further work is planned to strengthen the
prioritization rules with an emphasis on prioritizing signals based on
a clinical assessment of the potential risk to public health; this will
reduce the number of false alarms and increase the overall positive
predictive value.

There is no definitive list of every real incident that should have
been detected by syndromic surveillance and it is possible that some

of RAMMIE’s false alarms were real events that were not detected
by any other means (indeed the increase described associated with
air pollution may be one example). Further work is planned to ad—
dress such limitations, including identifying, through a variety of
sources, a comprehensive list of local gastrointestinal outbreaks and
assessing whether the syndromic surveillance systems were able to
detect these incidents.

The timeliness measure used for verification, although simple
could be biased in giving more weight to longer lasting incidents which
can skew the results. Alternative measures are available (Jafarpour
et al., 2013) which could be used in future validation work.

A high performing statistical method can result in improved pub—
lic health surveillance, with an increased likelihood of detecting key
incidents early and less time wasted investigating false alarms.

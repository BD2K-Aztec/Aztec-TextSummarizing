Abstract

Motivation: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are spherical bilayered proteolipids, harboring various bio—
active molecules. Due to the complexity of the vesicular nomenclatures and components, online
searches for EV—related publications and vesicular components are currently challenging.

Results: We present an improved version of EVpedia, a public database for EVs research. This com—
munity web portal contains a database of publications and vesicular components, identification of
orthologous vesicular components, bioinformatic tools and a personalized function. EVpedia in—
cludes 6879 publications, 172 080 vesicular components from 263 high—throughput datasets, and
has been accessed more than 65 000 times from more than 750 cities. In addition, about 350 mem—
bers from 73 international research groups have participated in developing EVpedia. This free web—
based database might serve as a useful resource to stimulate the emerging field of EV research.
Availability and implementation: The web site was implemented in PHP, Java, MySQL and
Apache, and is freely available at http://evpedia.info.

1 Introduction

Almost all living organisms on earth shed extracellular vesicles
(EVs) into their microenvironment. EVs are spherical bilayered pro-
teolipids with an average diameter of 20—1000 nm (Ellen et al.,
2009; Lee et al., 2008; Théry et al., 2009). Cells release EVs either
constitutively or in a regulated manner and these vesicles harbor a
specific subset of proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, lipids and metabolites
reflecting their originating cell types and conditions (Bellingham
et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2014; de Jong et al., 2012; Duperthuy et al.,
2013; Mayr et al., 2009; Raimondo et al., 2011; Simpson et al.,
2008; Subra et al., 2007; Wai et al., 2003). EVs are also found in
various biological fluids, such as amniotic fluid, ascites, breast milk,
plasma, saliva, semen, serum and urine (Asea et al., 2008; Caby
et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2014a, b; Dai et al., 2008; George et al.,
1982; Lasser et al., 2011; Poliakov et al., 2009; Raj et al., 2012;
Witwer et al., 2013). Recent advances in this fast growing field
(Fig. 1) have facilitated several insights: (1) EVs play multifaceted
functions in intercellular communication (Cocucci et al., 2009;

Lee et al., 2008; Simons and Raposo, 2009; Théry et al., 2009); (2)
EV-mediated intercellular communication is an evolutionarily con-
served phenomenon (Deatherage and Cookson, 2012; Lee et al.,
2008, 2009); (3) EVs are rich sources of biomarkers for non-invasive
diagnosis and prognosis of various human diseases (Chaput et al.,
2005; Choi et al., 2013a; D’Souza—Schorey and Clancy, 2012;
Mullier et al., 2013; Sarlon—Bartoli et al., 2013; Shedden et al.,
2003; Simpson et al., 2009); and (4) Diverse therapeutic approaches
have been pursued to utilize EVs and their mimetics for vaccine, che-
motherapeutic drug and siRNA delivery (Alvarez—Erviti et al., 2011;
Chaput et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2013; Kordelas et al., 2014; Lai
et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012; Simpson et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010).

Publications on EVs have grown rapidly during the last several
years, indicating that the field of EVs is expanding intensively
(Fig. 1). The identification of vesicle-specific cargos could help us to
unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the cargo sorting and
biogenesis of EVs. In addition, this will lead to better comprehension
of the pathophysiological functions of EVs, and discovery of EV-
based potential biomarkers of human diseases. Therefore, many

investigators have focused on categorizing these complex vesicular
components by various high-throughput technologies, such as mass
spectrometry-based proteomics and lipidomics as well as micro-
array- and next-generation sequencing-based transcriptomics (Barry
et al., 1997; Choi et al., 2013b; Koh et al., 2010; Utleg et al., 2003;
Valadi et al., 2007). Together with conventional biological
approaches, these multiomics-based analyses of EVs derived from
various cell types and body fluids have identified several thousands
of different vesicular components.

EV secretion and EV-mediated intercellular communication are
evolutionarily conserved (Biller et al., 2014; Deatherage and
Cookson, 2012; Lee et al., 2008, 2009). Researchers in this field
have coined dozens of different names for EVs, especially for more
complex eukaryotic cell-derived EVs as listed in Box (‘Extracellular
Vesicles: Diverse Nomenclature’) (Choi et al., 2014; Gould and
Raposo, 2013; Kim et al., 2013). Nevertheless, there is progress to-
ward a single nomenclature, since the different names in use make it
difficult to follow the progress in the field. In addition, most vesicu-
lar components identified by multiomics-based high throughput
analyses are presented in the supplementary information of pub-
lished articles. Taken together, online searches for EV-related publi-
cations and vesicular components are currently challenging,
especially for start-up researchers in this field. Therefore, a compre-
hensive public repository of EV-related publications and vesicular

components will help the community of EV research to understand
various aspects of these complex extracellular organelles.

2 Databases that store EV data

The explosion of EV data has justified the need for databases that
catalog proteins, nucleic acids and lipids associated with EVs.
Currently, three databases exist for EV research including ExoCarta
(Simpson et al., 2012), EVpedia (Kim et al., 2013) and Vesiclepedia
(Kalra et al., 2012). These existing databases have made large-scale
bioinformatics analyses feasible and provide an ideal platform for
EV-based biomarker studies. EVpedia provides additional benefits
compared with ExoCarta and Vesiclepedia. EVpedia is the only re-
source that contains data on both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In
addition, EVpedia allows for Gene Ontology enrichment analysis,
network analysis of vesicular proteins and mRNAs, and set analysis
of vesicular datasets by ortholog identification. Other databases do
not have any such embedded analysis tools.

3 Launch of EVpedia

EVpedia (http://evpedia.info) was first launched in January 2012
(Kim et al., 2013). To construct this public web-based database, we
first collected publications on prokaryotic and eukaryotic EVs
through a combination of NCBI PubMed searches (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) for text-mining solutions and manual
curation using all nomenclatures assigned to EVs described in Box
(see also Kim et al., 2013). Based on these EV-related publications,
we constructed the comprehensive and integrated database of pro-
teins, mRNAs, miRNAs, lipids and metabolites for systematic ana-
lyses of prokaryotic and eukaryotic EVs.

4 Overview of current EVpedia

Since the launch of EVpedia, we have improved this database by
continually collecting additional EV-related publications and data-
sets, by adding more tools for systematic analyses of EVs, and by
supplementing the menu bars for ‘Top 100+ EV markers’, ‘User
forum’ as well as ‘My EVpedia’. Through closed and open beta tests,
we built an ‘EVpedia Community’ (about 350 world-wide EV re-
searchers) and updated EVpedia most recently in May 2014.

The updated EVpedia has five functional modules for systematic
analyses of EVs derived from prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
(Fig. 2): (i) a database of publications and principal investigators,
(ii) a database of vesicular proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, lipids and

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Java has been extensively used for the visualization of
biological data in the web. However, the Java runtime environment is
an additional layer of software with an own set of technical problems
and security risks. HTML in its new version 5 provides features that for
some tasks may render Java unnecessary.

Results: ALIGNMENT-TO-HTML is the first HTML-based interactive visu-
alization for annotated multiple sequence alignments. The server side
script interpreter can perform all tasks like (i) sequence retrieval, (ii)
alignment computation, (iii) rendering, (iv) identification of a homolo-
gous structural models and (v) communication with BioDAS-servers.
The rendered alignment can be included in web pages and is dis-
played in all browsers on all platforms including touch screen tablets.
The functionality of the user interface is similar to legacy Java applets
and includes color schemes, highlighting of conserved and variable
alignment positions, row reordering by drag and drop, interlinked 3D
visualization and sequence groups. Novel features are (i) support for
multiple overlapping residue annotations, such as chemical modifica-
tions, single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations, (ii) mechanisms
to quickly hide residue annotations, (iii) export to MS-Word and (iv)
sequence icons.

Conclusion: ALIGNMENT-TO-HTML, the first interactive alignment
visualization that runs in web browsers without additional software,
confirms that to some extend HTML5 is already sufficient to display
complex biological data. The low speed at which programs are exe-
cuted in browsers is still the main obstacle. Nevertheless, we envision
an increased use of HTML and JavaScript for interactive biological
software.

1 INTRODUCTION

The amount of experimental sequence-related data, such as post-
translational modifications, ligand binding and genetic variants
is rapidly growing. Efﬁcient web-based Visualization facilitates
understanding of the biological meaning of comprehensive data
sets. Advanced Visualization of multiple sequence alignments
(MSA) includes sequence-related information such as residue
annotation, color-coding of physical properties of residues,

secondary structure and conservation/variation. A number of
programs have been developed for non-interactive rendering of
MSAs: Alscript (Barton, 1993), Boxshade, Espript (Gouet et al.,
2003) and TexShade (Beitz, 2000). These programs generate an
alignment figure according to a script ﬁle. The script can be
prepared manually in a text editor or dynamically by another
program. Therefore, these programs are suited to display com-
putational results of web services. The generated alignment ﬁg-
ures use vector graphics formats for quality reasons, but most
browsers do not support vector image formats (e.g. SVG) and
external document Viewers are required. A further disadvantage
is that these ﬁgures are static and lack interactivity. Interactive
capabilities, hyperlinks, baloon messages and the option to shield
information become increasingly important in the omics era.

Java brought interactive functionality to web pages and allows
alignment manipulation in real time (Caffrey et al., 2007; Clamp
et al., 2004; Lord et al., 2002). Owing to its cross-platform com-
patibility, integrated graphics and high execution speed, Java is
widely used.

But there are also ﬁve potential problems: (i) failure to start
Java applications, (ii) security Violations, (iii) browser crashes,
(iv) incompatibility on some platforms such as Android OS
and (V) slowing of the computer. Today the web standard
HTML5 is being increasingly used for interactive web applica-
tions such as genome browsers (Hoy, 2011; Medina et al., 2013;
Miller et al., 2013). The main advantage is that HTML5 code is
executed directly in the browsers without additional client side
software. A potential challenge with HTML5 code is that its
execution is slow, and we were wondering whether it would be
sufﬁcient for full-featured MSA Visualization.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Our alignment Visualization system consists of two parts: (i) A
server side non-interactive program generates a graphical repre-
sentation of the MSA in HTML according to an input text ﬁle.
(ii) A comprehensive JS-library encoding the interactive graph-
ical user interface for the HTML page.

Canvas elements allow for dynamic scriptable rendering of 2D
shapes and are used for secondary structure cartoons. If they are
not supported, the secondary structure is symbolized by text
characters. For maximum cross-browser compatibility, residues
are drawn as classical text elements with speciﬁc color, back-
ground and style attributes. This approach is robust and inde-
pendent of JavaScript. We found that client side rendering often
takes several seconds for large alignments. This is caused by the

low speed of JavaScript and manipulation of the document
object model. To prevent the initial delay when the page is
loaded, MSA rendering is already performed at server side.
Only if the user changes the color scheme or the conservation
threshold, client side computation of sequence conservation at all
positions is carried out and each residue is wrapped in a separate
node. Overlapping residue underlinings are laid out efﬁciently
such that the least amount of space below the sequence line is
occupied.

3 RESULTS

ALIGNMENT-TO-HTML is the first alignment Visualization pro-
gram for decorated MSAs using HTML featuring wrapped and
one-line sequence View, rendering styles, secondary structure,
drag and drop, pattern highlighting and several export options
(Fig. 1). Visualization is independent on plugins and therefore
robust while providing a rich user interface. Compared with
existing software for alignment Visualization, ALIGNMENT-
To-HTML provides novel functionality: It has the ability to dis-
play multiple overlapping residue annotations and the option to
export the alignment directly to MS-Word and full-featured
alignment workbenches. Icons may symbolize species or biolo-
gical tissues. Underlining all BioDAS sequence features for a
UNIPROT entry may result in an overcrowded confusing align-
ment ﬁgure. Therefore check boxes and the trash bin enable
reversible hiding of sequence features. Although existing align-
ment rendering software like Alscript, Espript, Boxshade,
TexShade do not take care of alignment computation them-
selves, ALIGNMENT-TO-HTML includes the entire logic for
alignment generation, rendering and annotation. This involves
data loading, alignment computation, 3D superposition, identi-
ﬁcation of homologous 3D structures and loading of annotations
from DAS servers. Currently, the scripting language comprises
>40 commands and numerous sequence and 3D rendering styles.

4 CONCLUSION

HTML5 is sufﬁcient for interactive alignment Visualization. It is
robust because it runs directly in standard web browsers
without plugins. Java is still required for 3D Visualization.

Fig. 1. Example of an interactive alignment View. Only a section of the
scrollable alignment is visible. The script consists of only three commands
to load the PFAM entry, to associate 3D structures and to load annota-
tions from DAS services. An asparagine residue that has been clicked in
the alignment is selected in the 3D View: Some sequence annotations are
deactivated with check boxes or with the trash bin such as mature protein
region (MPR)

ALIGNMENT-TO-HTML can be used for bioinformatics web ser-
vices or for locally installed programs to generate HTML ﬁles. It
takes care of all computations toward a full-rendered interactive
MSA.

Abstract

Motivation: Topological domains have been proposed as the backbone of interphase chromosome
structure. They are regions of high local contact frequency separated by sharp boundaries. Genes
within a domain often have correlated transcription. In this paper, we present a computational effi—
cient spectral algorithm to identify topological domains from chromosome conformation data
(Hi—C data). We consider the genome as a weighted graph with vertices defined by loci on a
chromosome and the edge weights given by interaction frequency between two loci. Laplacian—
based graph segmentation is then applied iteratively to obtain the domains at the given compact—
ness level. Comparison with algorithms in the literature shows the advantage of the proposed

strategy.

Results: An efficient algorithm is presented to identify topological domains from the Hi—C matrix.

1 Introduction

Chromosome conformation capture techniques (3C, 4C, Hi—C) have
yielded an unprecedented level of information about genome organ—
ization, and many studies are now exploring the relationship be—
tween genome structure and transcription (Cavalli and Misteli,
2013; Chen et (11., 2015b; Gorkin et (11., 2014). Chromosome con—
formation capture studies suggest that eukaryotic genomes are
organized into structures called topological domains (or topologic—
ally associating domains, TADs). Topological domains can be
defined as linear units of chromatin that fold as discrete three—di—
mensional (3D) structures tending to favor internal chromatin inter—
actions (Dixon et (11., 2012; Nora et (11., 2012). A majority of
regulatory protein binding sites localize within topological domains.
This suggests that sites associated with domain borders represent
a functionally different subclass of alleles that delimit regions con—
taining housekeeping genes and insulator sites (Van Bortle et (11.,
2014). Detecting the topological domains is thus helpful for

studying the relationship between chromosome organization and
gene transcription. For additional works on delineating structural
domains (see Le Dily et (11., 2014; L’evy—Leduc et (11., 2014; Liu et (11.,
2012; Pope et (11., 2014; Sexton et (11., 2012).

Topological domains can be detected using data from Hi—C,
which allows genome—wide identification of chromatin contacts.
The Hi—C method probes the 3D architecture of the whole genome
by coupling proximity—based ligation with massively parallel
sequencing. The Hi—C data matrix records the contact frequency be—
tween pairs of loci. Topological domains, as regions that have high
intra—contacts, are characterized by diagonal blocks in the Hi—C
matrix. To identify topological domains, in (Dixon et (11., 2012) the
authors employed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on the direc—
tionally index from a Hi—C matrix to determine regions initiated by
significant downstream chromatin interactions and terminated by a
sequence of significant upstream interactions. Filippova et al. (2014)
formulated the identification problem by maximizing the domain

total reads and introduced a dynamic programming algorithm to
solve the problem with a given scale parameter.

These methods perform analysis on a 1D read index or on a 2D
image segmentation subblock, and they suffer from sensitivity to
initialization (e.g. HMM model parameter adjustment), and high
computational complexity (e.g. dynamic programming for combina—
torial optimization). However, these methods do account for the
fact that Hi—C matrices depend on interactions of loci on the gen—
ome. Specifically, the largest entries in a Hi—C matrix define a graph
whose vertices are loci in the genome and whose edge weights are
the contact frequencies between loci. Loci with high contact fre—
quency are associated with small Euclidean distance in 3D space.
Identifying fine domain resolution structures such as TADs can
directly be translated to the problem of segmenting the graph into
components with weak interconnections. Such graph partitioning
approaches have been well developed in spectral graph theory
(Chung, 1997). Representation of HiC data as a graph and the usage
of graph theoretic approaches have also been investigated by Botta
et al. (2010) and Boulos et al. (2013). While the former uses net—
works to present its experiment results and the later use graph the—
ory to discover hubs in chromatin interaction data, neither of them
discusses from the point of view of the graph segmentation for
chromatin data. Based on a graph theoretic interpretation of Hi—C
matrices, we propose a simple and mathematically sound algorithm
for topological domain discovery based on spectral graph
cuts. Domains at different scales are identified by running the spec—
tral graph cuts algorithm recursively, until the connectivity of the
graph associated with the domain reaches the level of desired
compactness.

Compared with previous algorithms in Dixon et al. (2012) and
Filippova et al. (2014), the proposed spectral method has several
advantages: First, the method leads to topological domains that
are highly correlated with gene transcription. Second, the pro—
posed method admits a unique solution, and does not suffer from
the severe initialization sensitivity of the HMM method, which is
due to the fact that HMM involves an iterative expectation—maxi—
mization (EM) algorithm. Note that stability with respect to ini—
tialization affects the robustness of a method. Third, using the
proposed graph connectivity stopping criterion leads to domains
with sizes more closely related to the inherent structure of the re—
gion. Finally, the proposed method relates the Hi—C matrix to the
spatial coincidence of loci via a graph and has moderate computa—
tional complexity. In the results section, the advantages of the al—
gorithm are confirmed on Hi—C data collected from human
fibroblast.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Introduction to Hi—C data

Hi—C evaluates long—range interactions between pairs of segments
delimited by specific cutting sites by using spatially constrained liga—
tion, and provides ligation information (segment coordinates, seg—
ment directions, etc) for the pairs (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009).
These measurements are formatted into a square symmetric matrix
H, where il-
between loci i and j, where locus refers to a sequence of non—overlap—
ping windows of equal sizes. This window size is also referred to as
the resolution of the Hi—C matrix where 1 Mb and 100 kb are com—
mon resolutions. A Hi—C matrix is non—negative and diagonally
dominant and tapered because a segment has higher probability of
ligation with proximal regions as compared with distal regions.

stands for the total number of read pairs sequenced

Furthermore, segments from chromosome centrometric regions can—
not be uniquely mapped due to the presence of repeated sequences
along the chromosomal strand. Thus there are zero—valued bands in
the Hi—C matrix. These zero—valued bands are usually removed since
they are non—informative. Finally, the entries are always nonnegative
since they record the contact counts between pairs of loci. A Hi—C
matrix therefore naturally associates a graph to the genome, where
vertices are defined by binned loci in the genome, and the edge
weight between a pair of loci is proportional to their contact fre—
quency. Consequently, a TAD is a compact region that can often be
visually distinguished as a diagonal block in the Hi—C matrix. TADs
are strongly connected graph components having strong intra—
connections and weak inter—connections (see the Fig. 1(a)—(c) for
illustration).

2.2 Spectral graph theory

Modeling the spatial organization of chromosomes in a nucleus as a
graph allows us to use recently introduced spectral methods to
quantitively study their properties. Our strategy for identifying topo—
logical domains is based on spectral graph theory applied to the
Hi—C matrix. Relevant concepts are reviewed below.

We define a undirected graph as the ordered pairs of sets
g: (V,E) where V: {v1,v2,...,vN} is a finite set of vertices
with cardinality N, and E is an edge set consisting of elements of
the form {14, 11,-}, 1' 5E /. The adjacency matrix A(g) (or A for short)
is the symmetric N X N matrix encoding the adjacency relation—
ships in the graph g, such that [A(g)],,. : 1 only if {Um/i} E E,
otherwise [A(g)],.,. : 0, with [-jil- denoting the i/th entry of its ma—
trix argument. The degree of a given vertex, denoted by d(v,-), is

pressed as

[EA/i

with N,- denoting the neighboring vertices of 11,-. The degree matrix,
D(g), is defined as a diagonal matrix with the ith diagonal entry
given by d (11,-), namely,
d(1/,-) i : /'
D 1.. z (2)
[ (91’ l 0 i ye i.
The Laplacian of graph g is defined by
13(9) = D(Q) — AW), (3)

and the normalized Laplacian is given by

mg) : 1319—1113(9) —A<g>>D<g>‘%. 14>

For a graph, let the ordered eigenvalues of [3(9) (or £N(g)) be
denoted by 21, 22, . . . ,AN, where the following relation holds

0241342£"'34N- (5)

The second smallest eigenvalue 22 is known as the Fiedler number,
or algebraic connectivity, which characterizes the connectivity and
stability of the graph (Mesbahi and Egerstedt, 2010). When the
graph is connected the Fiedler number is strictly positive. Intuitively,
a more highly connected graph possesses a larger Fiedler number.
For example, a complete graph is a graph for which every vertex has
degree N — 1 and it has maximum Fiedler number among all graphs
over N vertices. Therefore, the Fiedler number is an appropriate
measure for associating the Hi—C data with the connectivity proper—
ties of the chromatin structures. The eigenvector associated with 22
is called the Fiedler vector. For a graph having several connected
components the Fiedler number is zero and the adjacency matrix is
permutation—equivalent to a block diagonal adjacency matrix A. In
this case the components can be uniquely identified from the signs of
the corresponding entries of the Fiedler vector (Shi and Malik,
2000). The positive and negative pattern defined by the Fiedler vec—
tor is called the nodal domain (Fig. 1(d)).

More generally, instead of considering binary connections be—
tween pairs, weights can be assigned to each edge such that [A(g)],,.
: an,- only if {11,-,1/,-} E E (otherwise [A(g)],, : 0) to characterize the
connection strengths. The associated degree matrix, D(g), and
Laplacian, [3(9) (or £N(g)), are defined in the same way as in (2)—
(4). See (Chung, 1997; Mesbahi and Egerstedt, 2010) for more de—
tails on spectral matrix theory for weighted matrices.

2.3 Characterizing the TAD graph with the normalized
La placian

The Hi—C matrix can be interpreted as a weighted adjacency ma—
trix for TAD graph. The normalized Laplacian (4) has several ad—
vantages over the unnormalized Laplacian (3). The spectrum of the
unnormalized Laplacian is inﬂuenced by the nodes having the
highest vertex degree. This can lead to the high degree nodes mask—
ing the nodes with lower vertex degrees, and consequently leads to
loss of sensitivity to complex structure. An extreme example of
this is the case where there is one very highly connected component
and other smaller connected components in the graph. In this case,
the connectivity structure of the highly connected component will
have dominating inﬂuence on the graph spectrum, masking the
spectral imprint of the of the other components. The normalized

Laplacian levels the playing field for both highly connected compo—
nents with nodes of high average vertex degree and components
with nodes of lower average vertex degree. This reduces the mask—
ing effect and leads to higher sensitivity to hidden structure. Using
the Fiedler number from the normalized Laplacian leads to captur—
ing the local structure patterns without being affected by
other regions on the same chromosome with high vertex degree,
which is consistent with our biological objective of finding the 10—
cally organized regions having co—regulated genes. Furthermore,
unlike the unnormalized Laplacian (3), the normalized Laplacian
(4) has a Fiedler number that is upper bounded, specifically
12 3 ﬁ 3 2.

3 Topological domain identification with graph
segmentation

As presented, the Fiedler vector of the Hi—C matrix can thus be used
to segment the chromosome into domains, and the Fielder value of
each domain indicates whether the obtained domain is sufficiently
compact, or needs to be further divided. We firstly present some
relevant notation and pre—processing, then the proposed strategy.

3.1 Notation and pre—processing

3.1. 1 Dynamic range reduction

Let H be the observed Hi—C matrix of a given chromosome of length
L (with unmappable regions and diagonal entries removed), and let
H be a transformed Hi—C matrix with reduced dynamic range

_ 0 for i :j
H” 2 {mm for i #1; ‘6)

where the function f is introduced to alleviate the large dispersion
of the raw Hi—C matrix data. Functions such as the power transform
f : x“, with a typically in E, %j, or the logarithmic transform f
: log(x) can be used. Besides reducing data variability, since the Hi—C
matrix is a matrix of counts that can be modeled as Poisson, power
transform can be designed with an exponent that depends on the pos—
ition of the entry in the matrix (Chen et al., 20153; Hu et al., 2012).
The power transform with a : % (Anscombe, 1948, 1953) normalizes
the variance of the Poisson entries. Alternatively, the logarithmic
transform make entries approximately normal. The function f can
also be selected as a canonical link between Poisson variables and ex—
planatory variables for Hi—C matrices in a generalized linear model
(GLM) framework (Hu et al., 2012).

3.1.2 Toeplitz normalization

If two loci lie on the same chromosome of DNA, maximal separ—
ation between two loci is the length of DNA lying between them. As
a result closely spaced loci are likely to have large Hi—C read counts,
regardless of their specific conformation. To remove the distance ef—
fect, we employ a Toeplitz normalization. The Toeplitz normaliza—
tion divides the (i, /)th entry in the Hi—C matrix by the mean of all
matrix entries at the same distance Ii — [I from the diagonal.
Mathematically, this step is described by:

HN I H®E7 (7)

where ® corresponds to elementvvise division of entries of H and E,
and the entries of E are given by

with the setIu : {m,nlm — n : k —£,0 < [2,2 < L}, card(I) de—
notes the cardinality of the finite set I. The Toeplitz matrix E repre—
sents the expected contact frequency as a function of the genome
distance. Note that read depth normalization (the read depth nor—
malization is defined as HD : cDT1HDT1 where D is a diagonal
matrix with [D],,- :  ,7, and the scalar c is the total number of
reads) can be performed beforehand, but we found this does not
lead to significant difference in the results (see Supplemental
Material (SM)).

3.1.3 Fiedler number and vector calculation operator
For an adjacency matrix A, we use the operator notation

22,11 <— FV(A) (9)

to denote the extraction of the Fiedler number 22 and the Fiedler
vector U, by computing the eigen—decomposition of the normalized
Laplacian of A defined in (4). When we want to emphasize the ex—
traction of the Fiedler vector, we abuse notation by omitting 22 from
the notation (9), i.e. we write U <— Fv(A).

3.2 Topological domain extraction via recursive
partitioning

In this subsection, a topological domain extraction strategy is pro—
posed based on the normalized graph Laplacian. The algorithm con—
siders both local interactions and long—range interactions embedded
in the Hi—C matrix. The algorithm first extracts initial domains via
the sign of the Fiedler vector, then it splits each domain recursively
until the Fiedler number of a newly obtained domain is higher than
some threshold and the size of the domain is sufficiently small. As
the Fielder number is proportional to the algebraic connectivity, this
threshold ensures discovery of sufficiently disconnected domains.

At the first step, we consider the weighted graph with edge
weights defined by the Toeplitz normalized matrix HN. The Fiedler
vector, denoted by 11(1), of this graph is computed and the graph is
segmented into two clusters that are differentiated by the signs of
the Fiedler vector entries. A number of locally compact structures
are then given by the sets of vertices with the same sign on the larg—
est range of continuous indices from i to i. This results in the region
DH defined by 115-1),U1(;11)1, . . . will) having the same sign.
Experimentally we have observed that the sizes of these domains
vary from 100 kb to several megabases. They can naturally be
defined as the initial topological domains. We can identify over
3000 TADs determined by the Fiedler vector derived from HN. We
will see that compared with the gene expression represented by
RNA—seq counts, regions within each domain approximately behave
in a binary manner, all active, or all inactive. Further, all domains
with the same sign behave binary manner, active or inactive. From
spectral graph theory, we known that domains with the same sign
are in the same cluster, and have fewer connections to other clusters
than connections within their own cluster. This result obtained from
HN considers the overall contact organization of the chromatin.
This step results in segmentations that are similar to the compart—
ments A and B obtained from (Lieberman—Aiden et al., 2009). A
further comparison can be found in supplementary materials
(Section 4).

Topological domains are likely to exhibit hierarchical structures
(Filippova et al., 2014). After determining the initial domains via the
Fiedler vector of HN, we therefore further divide these domains to
sub—domains having smaller sizes. For an obtained domain D,_,-, we
calculate the Fiedler vector of the graph whose adjacency matrix is
given by the sub—matrix of H indexed by DH, followed by splitting

 

Algorithm 1. Identiﬁcation of TADs via graph Laplacian

 

Parameters: Fiedler number threshold 21hr, and user—supplied
lower bound L on domain size.
Pre-processing: For a given chromosome, compute the matrix
H using (6) and the normalized matrix HN
using (7).
Algorithm:
Step 1: Calculate the Fiedler vector of the matrix HN:

12(1) <— Fv(HN) (10)

Initial TADs are given by the contiguous regions in 11(1) with
the same sign.

Step 2: For each obtained domain, compute its Fiedler number
and vector for each associated sub—matrix in H:

12,1; <— FV(I:IDH) (11)

If the Fiedler number is smaller than the threshold 22 g 21hr,
segment the current domain again via U.

Recursion: Repeat step 2 until the obtained sub—domain has a
Fiedler number larger than the threshold, or its size reaches
the lower bound L.

 

DH into sub—domains based on the signs of its Fiedler vector entries.
In this step matrix H is used, since the determining these smaller
sub—domains relies on diagonal block structures in H, instead of the
long—range interactions exhibited in HN. The Fiedler number of the
obtained domains are calculated and compared with a predefined
threshold ﬁrth, to determine whether they are sufficiently compact, or
can further be split. The full algorithm is summarized in Algorithm
1. An example of the algorithm processing is illustrated in supple—
mental data file (Supplementary Fig. S1). A discussion of this two—
step strategy and alternative strategies is included in the SM.

3.3 Computational complexity

The complexity of the proposed algorithm is dominated by the
eigen—decomposition of the normalized Laplacian matrices. Step 1
requires the eigen—decomposition on a moderate size matrix (e.g.
$2300 X 2300 for chromosome 1 at 100 kb resolution, $350 X 350
for Chromosome 22 at 100 kb resolution). The resultant recursions
will process matrices of much smaller sizes, and the computational
time for eigen—decomposition is reduced significantly. In the next
section, we will provide more details on computational require—
ments. For higher resolutions with larger matrices, this computation
can be performed more efficiently by only computing a few of the
first smallest eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors, using, for
example, power iterations (Saad, 1992), or by distributed means
(Kang et al., 2011). These particular strategies will be investigated
in future work.

4 Results

In this section, we illustrate the proposed algorithm and compare it
with previously proposed algorithms. The algorithms were first
applied to Hi—C data obtained from human foreskin fibroblasts
from a normal karyotyped male individual. Fragment contacts were
binned to generate Hi—C matrices at 100 kb resolution. The Hi—C li—
brary, RNA—seq library, data collection, and raw data processing

were all performed by our laboratory, see SM and Chen et al.
(2015b) for the protocols, the detailed cell culture and data collec—
tion methods. The algorithm was then applied to Hi—C data from
IMR90 cells at a higher 5 kb resolution. Details of the toolbox can
be found in Section 1 of SM.

For comparison, we considered the topological domains extrac—
tion methods presented in Dixon et al. (2012) and Filippova
et al.(2014). In Dixon et al. (2012), the authors defined the direc—
tionality index (DI) at each bin by

Ndown _ Nup (Nup _ Nav)2 (Ndown — Nav)2
lNdown _ Nupl Nav Nav 7

 

ZDI : (12)

where Nup denotes the reads from the current bin to 2 Mb upstream,
Ndown denotes the reads from the current bin to 2 Mb downstream,
and Nav : %(Nup + Ndown). Then the directionality index was mod—
eled as the observation of a hidden Markov model (HMM) under a
Gaussian mixture model, endowed with three hidden states associ—
ated with the start, end and middle of a domain. In Filippova et al.
(2014), the authors formulated the topological domain identifica—
tion problem via the following optimization:

max 4,", bi, 1 . 1 3
 lggﬂa /) 1 >

The function q is defined by q(k,l, y) : 5(k, l,y) — 11502 — l),
where 5(k, l, y) :  with y a scale parameter and NJ.) is total reads
between loci k and l, and 11502 — l) is mean value of 5(k, l, y) over all
sub—matrices of length l — k. The optimization (13) was solved via
dynamic programming (DP).

For brevity, in this paper we illustrate the identified topological
domains for one of the smaller chromosomes of the fibroblasts: chr—
22. Results on all the other chromosomes can be found in Figure
52—523 in the supplemental file. The logarithmic transform f was

used in (6) to reduce the dynamic range of data and for variance nor—
malization. The proposed algorithm and the two comparative algo—
rithms were then applied to the transformed Hi—C matrix of
Chromosome 22. For the HMM method, we took reads from cur—
rent bin to 1 Mb upstream and downstream for Nup and Ndown in—
stead of the 2 Mb in the original presentation upstream/downstream
distance in order to investigate its effect on the domain size distribu—
tion in the HMM segmentation. However, the upstream/down—
stream distance did not appear to have an effect on the size
distribution. For the DP algorithm, the parameter V was set to y
: 0.2 and 0.25, respectively. For the proposed algorithm, Algorithm
1 was implemented with ﬁrth, : 0.8 and 0.9, respectively.

The identified topological domains are illustrated in Figure 2
with diagonal blocks marked by blue squares. It can be observed
that the proposed algorithm provides results that are most consistent
with the observations, and finer domains can be obtained hierarchic—
ally by increasing the threshold lthr. Compared with the proposed
algorithm, the HMM methods have difficulty controlling the do—
main resolution to user specifications. Furthermore, the HMM algo—
rithm suffers from the problem of convergence to local maxima of
the likelihood function and is over—sensitive to the initialization. The
DP method has very high computational complexity, especially for
large chromosomes. A comparison among these algorithms and
quantitive computational time are reported in Table 1 and 2 respect—
ively. The advantage of the proposed algorithm in computational ef—
ficiency for Hi—C data at 100kb resolution is obvious. Detailed
information on the boundary coordinates identified by the three al—
gorithms are provided in the SM.

We use Chromosome 22 to illustrate the capability of the pro—
posed algorithm to identify meaningful domains. The size distribu—
tion of identified TADs using the proposed algorithm with
ﬁrth, : 0.8 and ﬁrth, : 0.9 are shown in Figure 3(a).Their boundary
coordinates are reported in Table S3. While varying the Fiedler

number threshold 21hr, we then count the number of domains identi—
fied by the proposed algorithm and compute the mean size of the do—
mains. In the top part of Figure 3(b), as expected the number of
domains found in Chromosome 22 increases with increasing 21hr.
Not shown are the results of decreasing the threshold below 0.8,
where there is little change in segmentation. This is due to the fact
that the segmentation on HN in Step 1 results in small size domains.
Finally, when the threshold reaches ﬁrth, : 2, the domains are com—
posed of single bins and the number of domains equals the size of
the Hi—C matrix. We compare the identified TADs with those identi—
fied by the HMM method. First, the proposed methods identified
more TADs than the HMM method (Supplementary Table S2 and
Table S3). Second, note that the proposed method and HMM give
very different TAD segmentations. Even the first splitting step

results in a larger number of domains than that identified by the
HMM method. We show below that the TADs produced by the pro—
posed spectral method with have significantly higher correlation to
the transcriptional gene expression as determined by RNAseq (see
Fig. 4). Therefore we conclude that the proposed method captures
more meaningful structures. Furthermore the domain boundaries
captured from these two methods often do not line up (See
Supplementary Table S3) making further comparisons between the
proposed spectral methods and the HMM method difficult.
Figure3(b) shows the total number of domains identified for
Chromosome 22. Correspondingly, the bottom part of Figure 3(b)
shows the mean TAD size, which is expected to decrease with in—
creases in the Fiedler number threshold. The results for the rest of
the chromosomes are reported in the supplementary materials. Our
proposed method also reveals that although they have the same alge—
braic connectivity (Fielder number), the topological domains of Chr
17 and 19 are larger than those of Chr 18. This may be related to
the fact that Chr 17 and 19 are rich in protein coding genes while
Chr 1 8 has fewer such genes.

We next illustrate the relationship between the chromosome
structure and gene expression via the identified topological domains.

Gene expression is represented by RNA—seq counts. RNA—seq was
performed simultaneously with Hi—C in our laboratory. In order to
be consistent with Hi—C matrix resolution, we summarized the gene
RNA—seq counts into bins of 100 kb resolution, according to their
locations. In Figure 4(a), we show the Fiedler vector of
Chromosome 22 obtained in Step 1 of Algorithm 1 and its RNA—seq
counts. It can be observed that the sign pattern of the Fiedler vector
has high correlation with the expression levels of the RNA—seq data.
Note that each locally consistent sign region is a topological domain
obtained at Step 1 of Algorithm 1. To show this in a quantitive man—
ner, we took the sign of the Fiedler vector and thresholded the
RNA—seq count vector (where the threshold was selected for each
chromosome to maximize the correlation), and then computed the
correlation coefficient between these two vectors for all chromo—
somes. The correlation values are shown in Figure 4(b). Significant
correlation is observed according to this result (with p < 10‘6 by
permutation test. This shows that initial TADs are generally consist—
ent with the two chromosome compartments in the genome, hetero—
chromatin or euchromatin. We also show the decreasing trend of
the relation between the averaged variance of log—scaled RNA—Seq
reads within TADs versus the Fiedler number threshold
(Supplementary Fig. S33). These results confirm the relationship be—
tween the identified topological domains and the functional expres—
sion (Dixon et al., 2012; Lieberman—Aiden et al., 2009), and also
reveals the quality of the identified topological domain.

As compared to DP and HMM methods, the proposed method
identifies TAD boundaries that are more consistent with the loca—
tions of known CTCF enrichment peaks. We plot the CTCF ChIP—
seq enrichment at bins of 100 kb resolution with the locations of
identified TAD boundaries for the three compared algorithms in
Figure 5, with CTCF enrichment extracted from (Ziebarth et al.,
2013). It has been proposed that TAD boundaries coincide with in—
sulators such as CTCF binding sites. However, 85% of CTCF bind—
ing sites localize within TADs rather than at their borders,
suggesting that most CTCF sites are unlikely to aide in identifying
the borders that separate TADs. Meanwhile, multiple studies sug—
gest that some insulator elements are not capable of enhancer—block—
ing or chromatin barrier activity (Schuettengruber and Cavalli,
2013; Schwartz et al., 2012; Van Bortle et al., 2012). Compared
with the other two algorithms, the boundaries identified by the

proposed algorithm are more consistent with CT CF enrichment
peaks. A particularly visible example can be found for the large
TAD between 300 and 350 bins.

Finally, we illustrate the scalability of the proposed spectral algo—
rithm to Hi—C data at higher resolution (5 kb) by applying it to the
Hi—C IMR90 cell data of Rao et al. (2014). Results of the last 2000
bins with 211,, : 0.4 and 2th, : 0.6 are shown in Figure 6 for
Chromosome 22.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a method for identifying topological do—
mains based on the spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian
of the Hi—C matrix. The proposed algorithm has clear mathematical
interpretation and is more computationally efficient than previous
methods, allowing it to be applied to higher resolution Hi—C data.
Its favorable comparison with other algorithms and its higher correl—
ation with gene transcription dataillustrate the advantages of the
proposed spectral method. Future work may include investigating
fast iterative algorithms or parallel computation algorithms for im—
proving the efficiency at higher resolutions.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A new algorithm to trace conformational transitions in
proteins is presented. The method uses discrete molecular dynamics
as engine to sample protein conformational space. A multiple minima
Go-like potential energy function is used in combination with several
enhancing sampling strategies, such as metadynamics, Maxwell
Demon molecular dynamics and essential dynamics. The method,
which shows an unprecedented computational efficiency, is able to
trace a wide range of known experimental transitions. Contrary to
simpler methods our strategy does not introduce distortions in
the chemical structure of the protein and is able to reproduce well com-
plex non-linear conformational transitions. The method, called GOdMD,
can easily introduce additional restraints to the transition (presence of
ligand, known intermediate, known maintained contacts,...) and is
freely distributed to the community through the Spanish National
Bioinformatics Institute (http://mmbirbbarcelona.org/GOdMD).

1 INTRODUCTION

Many biological functions of proteins such as mechanic work,
signal transduction or enzymatic activity are modulated by a key
property of them: ﬂexibility (Henzler-Wildman et al., 2007;
Micheletti, 2013; Velazquez-Muriel et al., 2009). Flexibility is a
property that has been reﬁned and maintained by evolution
(Falke, 2002; Micheletti, 2013) and that, in turn has been also
exploited by evolution to generate new proteins in a conservative
mechanism, which guarantees the maintenance of the structural
scaffold as well as the relevant deformation pattern (Leo-Macias
et al., 2005; Stein et al., 2011). Structural databases show
(Gerstein and Krebs, 1998) increasing number of proteins
having alternative structures depending on external factors
(such as crystallization conditions, posttransductional chem-
ical modiﬁcations, presence of ligands, changes in solvent

environment, etc). This probes the existence of dramatic con-
formational transitions in proteins, but giving no information
on how such transitions happen.

Recent refinements of experimental techniques have provided
direct evidence on the mechanisms of conformational transitions
for some model proteins (Ban et al., 201 1; Eisenmesser et al., 2002;
Fenwick et al., 2011; Kern and Zuiderweg, 2003; Lindorff-Larsen
et al., 2005). However, we are still far from the point that all con-
formational transitions could be described by means of experi-
mental methods. This situation forces the use of simulation
techniques, which has been largely refined in the past years
(Best et al., 2005; Bolhuis et al., 2002; Karplus and Kuriyan,
2005; Kubitzki and de Groot, 2008; Maragakis and Karplus,
2005; Miyashita, 2003; Okazaki et al., 2006), providing informa-
tion of increasing quality for a large number of conformational
transitions in proteins (Sfriso et al., 2012; Stein et al., 2011).

Molecular dynamics (MD), using atomistic force-ﬁelds and
explicit representation of solvent (McCammon et al., 1977), is
probably the most accurate theoretical technique for reproducing
protein flexibility. Recent computational approaches have made
possible the simulation of thousands of proteins (Meyer et al.,
2010) and the derivation of up to millisecond trajectories for
proteins (Dror et al., 2012; Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2011).
Unfortunately, most conformational transitions are still far
from the capabilities of plain atomistic MD, forcing the use of
biasing schemes (Beckstein et al., 2009; Das et al., 2006; Laio and
Parrinello, 2002; Leone et al., 2010; Liphardt et al., 2002;
Schlitter, 1994), designed to maximize the sampling along a
given variable that is believed to capture conformational transi-
tion motions. Biased-MD protocols are extremely powerful, but
they are expensive computationally, require expertise from the
user and can lead to incorrect results when the transition coord-
inate is not well deﬁned.

Coarse-grained (CG) models (Bahar and Rader, 2005;
Dobbins et al., 2008; Lopez-Blanco et al., 2011; Mendez and
Bastolla, 2010; Orozco et al., 2011; Tozzini, 2005; Whitford
et al., 2007) are inexpensive, but still accurate alternatives
to atomistic MD simulations, which have gained significant
popularity in recent years. Unfortunately, the use of CG
models require the assumption of a certain loss of detail in the
simulation, for example, explicit solvent is ignored, which pre-
vent the study of speciﬁc wateriprotein interactions and side
chains are either ignored or dramatically simpliﬁed (Mendez
and Bastolla, 2010; Marrink et al., 2007), which raises problems

to reproduce ligand-target interactions. CG models have been
calibrated against experimental data, such as B-factors, struc-
tural variability in databases or atomistic MD, and despite
their simplicity, provide often results of surprising quality
with limited computer resources and reduced expertise from
the user.

CG—methods have been largely used to trace conformational
transitions in proteins. The ﬁrst implementations followed
mainly interpolation schemes between original and ﬁnal con-
formations (Delarue and Sanejouand, 2002; Flores et al., 2006;
Franklin et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2002; Krebs and Gerstein, 2000;
Lindahl et al., 2006; Weiss and Levitt, 2009). Interpolation
protocols are fast and guarantee the completion of the transition,
but often at the expense of unrealistic intermediate conform-
ations, which are not good starting points for refinement through
more accurate atomistic simulations. Alternative CG—transition
methods have been developed under the assumption that bio-
logically relevant transitions should follow the easiest deform-
ation movements of the proteins (Bahar et al., 2010; Lezon
et al., 2009; Mendez and Bastolla, 2010; Yang et al., 2009)
defined as the softest deformation modes obtained by diagona-
lization of the Hessian matrix derived from an elastic network
model (ENM) Hamiltonian:

where i and j are residues, 8,-1- is a delta function equal to 1 when i
and j are at less than a given distance, and 0 otherwise; K is a
spring constant (linear or distance dependent), Ril- stands for
inter-residue distance and the superscript 0 refers to the value
of Ki]- in the reference structure.

Morphing methods based on the use of essential deformation
modes provide more reasonable approaches than linear interpol-
ation schemes, but are far from being optimal since (i) the cova-
lent structure of the protein can be damaged when large
displacements along a limited number of Cartesian eigenvectors
are made, (ii) a non-negligible number of transitions do not align
with the intrinsic deformation pattern of proteins (Stein et al.,
2011), and even those cases where the alignment between the
essential deformation space and the transition vector is good,
displacement along the essential space of one of the proteins
never allows a full transition between the two conformational
states. Recent advances in the field, such as the use of multiple
reference structures to deﬁne a transition-dependent essential de-
formation space (Sfriso et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2009) or the
derivation of the essential deformation modes in the dihedral
space (Lopez-Blanco et al., 2011; Mendez and Bastolla, 2010),
have alleviated but not solved these problems.

In this article, we present a new approach to obtain ultra-fast,
but accurate, conformational transition pathways in proteins out
of physics-based molecular mechanics simulations. By combining
an efﬁcient sampling technique [discrete molecular dynamics
(dMD; Orozco et al., 2011; Proctor et al., 2011)] with a novel
multiple-well Go-like scheme. Sampling is enhanced with biasing
techniques such as metadynamics (Laio and Parrinello, 2002)
and Maxwell Demon MD (Rueda et al., 2004; Sfriso et al.,
2012). The method was tested in a large battery of transitions
(near 50 pairs of structures) obtaining, with reduced

computational cost, reasonable pathways in all cases, including
in cases of extreme difﬁculty, where transition requires, for ex-
ample, partial unfolding of the protein. Owing to the physical
nature of the method, sampled intermediate structures maintain
covalent structure, and no steric clashes are allowed. In cases
where experimental intermediates are characterized, the method
ﬁnds transition paths passing close to them. Surprisingly, the
method outperforms our previous more detailed algorithm,
Maxwell Demon discrete molecular dynamics procedure
(MDdMD; Sfriso et al., 2012), and is also competitive with re-
spect to alternative methods in the literature (Supplementary
Figs S17S3). Our novel approach is ﬂexible, allowing the intro-
duction of any perturbation. Furthermore, the user can easily
bias trajectories to guarantee that known experimental inter-
mediates are sampled.

2 METHODS

In this approach we have applied the dMD method [see (Emperador et al.,
2008b; Proctor et al., 2011) for details]. In dMD, particles move in the
ballistic regime, with constant velocity until a collision occurs. Collisions
occur at the particleiparticle distances corresponding to a discontinuity in
the dMD potential. The velocities of the particles after the collision are
obtained using the rules of conservation of momentum and energy. This
allows avoiding the integration of Newton’s equations of motion, speeding
up the simulations as compared with usual MD. Discrete MD has success-
fully been applied to protein folding (Ding et al., 2005; Zhou and Karplus,
1997), macromolecular dynamics (Emperador et al., 2008a, 2010), RNA
structural predictions (Ding et al., 2008, 2012; Gherghe et al., 2009) and
protein aggregation (Ding and Dokholyan, 2008; Urbanc et al., 2004,
2010). Recently dMD has been also used to robust energy minimization
of proteiniprotein complexes (Emperador et al., 2013) and proteiniligand
interactions (Proctor et al., 2012).

2.1 F orce-ﬁeld representation

We adopted a CG representation of the protein, where only Cots were
explicitly represented. We used a single square well with inﬁnite walls to
deﬁne the bonded interactions between consecutive beads. The non-
bonded interactions were described by a multiple well Go-like model
(Taketomi et al., 1975; Ueda et al., 1978) depending on the experimental
inter-particle distance. Non-bonded terms of the Hamiltonian were clas-
siﬁed in two categories based on whether or not the inter-particle distance
is different between the initial (A) and ﬁnal (B) conformations. If they
are, we deﬁne a double well potential (Fig. 1) centered in the respective
experimental values: ?A and VB. When the distances are similar in both
conformations (i.e. ?A ~ VB), we used a single, but wider, well (50% larger)
centered at 1/2 (7A + 73). To avoid over-restraining the system with phys-
ically irrelevant interactions, the potential energy was deﬁned only for
those particles within a cutoff (7A, ?B>radii of gyration/2). It is worth
noting that the height of the wells for all non-bonded interactions is ﬁnite
(0.5 kcal/mol), allowing the particles to escape from the wells if required.

This Go-like scheme is convenient to complete transition paths [>85%
of the root mean square deviation (RMSd) difference between end struc-
tures) because target minimum acts as attractor. This situation enables us
to use softer biasing schemes and to better recover native contacts (see
Supplementary Materials for details].

2.2 Accelerating the transition

Within the Hamiltonian deﬁnition above, the A—>B transition occurs
through a movement of particles jumping from wells centered at 7A to
those centered at VB. Unfortunately, as a side effect of Go-like potentials,

spontaneous hopping from one minimum to another is difﬁcult, making
unlikely to ﬁnd a spontaneous transition. We decided then to bias the
trajectory to guarantee enrichment of sampling along the transition path.
For this purpose, we implemented here a complex biasing scheme de-
signed to favor the transition, but avoiding the use of restrains that

would guide the trajectory along arbitrary (and probably unrealistic
paths). The ﬁrst level of biasing is designed to move the protein far
from the starting conformation, while the second level is designed to
enrich biasing to approach the protein to the ﬁnal conformation. For
the interested reader, a ﬂowchart of the algorithm is presented in
Supplementary Figure S4.

2.2.] Escaping from the initial minima We have implemented a
discrete version of the metadynamics method (Laio and Parrinello,
2002) to guarantee that the system leaves the original minima.
Metadynamics penalizes visits to the original well by raising gradually
the energy of the well (i.e. by ﬁlling it; Fig. 1), which increases the chances
of the system to escape from the attraction of the Go-potentials to the
starting structure. As a consequence, as trajectory progresses sampling of
the original conformation is less and less probable and system departs
from the original conformation. Metadynamics is efficient as a method to
escape from a minimum, but such a divergence happens in a random way,
which can yield to unrealistic deformations when applied in an unsuper-
vised fashion. To solve this problem, we have coupled metadynamics to
an ENM (Emperador et al., 2008a; Orellana et al., 2010) in such a way
that wells associated to inter-particle distances showing large changes
along the ﬁrst ﬁve essential deformation modes were ﬁlled faster than
those associated to inter-particle distances that are not coupled to the
essential deformation modes of the protein (Fig. 1). This strategy guar-
antees the exploration of alternative ways to escape from the original
structure minima, while increasing the possibility to sample preferred
pathways as deﬁned by the essential deformation modes (ﬁrst ﬁve are
considered by default, but results are largely invariant in the range 3710
modes (data not shown). Note that the ENM analysis is done only with
the initial structure irrespectively of which the target structure is, avoiding
the deﬁnition of too linear pathways. Note also that the full dMD simu-
lations are done, which means that all the degrees of freedom (and not
only the ﬁve preferred ones) are sampled.

2.2.2 Moving toward the ﬁnal conformation The ENM-metady-
namics procedure outlined above guarantees that the protein moves
apart from the original structure sampling preferentially essential deform-
ation modes. However, there is no guarantee that such movements will
approach the protein to the ﬁnal conformation. To guide the trajectory
toward the ﬁnal structure, without introducing arbitrary energy re-
straints, we have implemented a Maxwell Demon biasing algorithm
(Perilla et al., 2010; Rueda et al., 2004; Sfriso et al., 2012) with a control
magnitude (1") deﬁned as follows:

N
r = 260(1) ||r,-,B — r,-,X|| (2)
i:1

where N is the total number of residues, B is the target structure, X is the
sampled conformation (X: A for the original conformation) and w( i ) is
an optimized weight function dependent on the inter-particle distance and
the size of protein (Supplementary Fig. S5; results are robust to a) values
in the range 1&25A are used).

Following the MDdMD procedure the bias toward the target structure
is not introduced by an energy penalty, but using a less interfering infor-
mational criteria (Perilla et al., 2010). The scheme is simple and efﬁcient,
after a certain number of dMD simulation steps (time t) the value of the
progress variable (1"; equation 2) is compared with that obtained in a
previous accepted movement (t—At). The simulation fragment t-At—>t is
then accepted or rejected based on a simple Metropolis test (equation 3):

adjusted to guarantee an acceptation rate of 70%, and the time frame
(At) is typically 100 time steps. These large acceptance rates, combined
with a weight function with a maximum at ~15A enables the system to
explore no so direct pathways that could lead to stressed structures and
provides the best local geometries (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). The
presence of the Go-potentials of the target structure in the Hamiltonian
avoids the need to increase ,8 when trajectory approaches the ﬁnal target
conformation.

3 RESULTS

To evaluate the power of GOdMD, we apply it to trace transi-
tions between known equilibrium conformations of proteins.
After analyzing protein data bank (PDB), we deﬁne a set of 94
transitions corresponding to 47 proteins showing two distinct
conformations. This large benchmark set was extracted from a
previous work in our group (Sfriso et al., 2012) and spans a wide
range of proteins from 100 to 1000 residues, showing different
shapes and secondary structure composition. The database con-
tains no trivial conformational changes and some of the con-
formational transitions represent dramatic geometrical
alterations in the structure of the protein, including refolding
in some cases. Many of the transitions are coupled to the binding
to small ligands (60%) and/or macromolecules (39%), which
increase the difﬁculties to trace reasonable conformational tran-
sition pathways. Further analysis of the data set reveals that a
significant fraction of the transitions (44%) correspond to open/
close ones, which can a priori generate hysteresis problems.
Finally, 22% of the transitions do not align well [overlap (accu-
mulated dot product) between top five normal modes and con-
formational transition is below 0.25] with the ﬁrst ﬁve essential
deformation modes detected from EN—normal mode analysis
(NMA), i.e. that they will be very difficult to represent by
simply activating movements along intrinsic deformation
modes. Looking at different criteria (Sfriso et al., 2012) we con-
sider 62 of the 94 transitions as difﬁcult or very difﬁcult to
follow, which means that we are validating our method with
the most exigent transition dataset available.

GOdMD has been able to find reasonable pathways for all
studied transitions, even those requiring large refolding pro-
cesses. The algorithm can provide multiple transition trajectories,
defining a scenario of multiple pathways, which ﬁts better into
the transition funnel theory (Dill and Chan, 1997; Portella and
Orozco, 2010). Furthermore, no Violations of covalent distances,
nor steric clashes or chemical meaningless conformations are
sampled during transitions, which are always smooth, without
the presence of apparent discontinuities or hysteresis effects
(Supplementary Fig. S8). PROSA (Wiederstein and Sippl,
2007) calculations performed in random conformations sampled
during the different transition yields to native-like profiles
(Supplementary Figs S9 and S10), indicating that we are not
sampling unrealistic conformations along the transition. The
method is extremely efﬁcient, >60% of trajectories are ﬁn-
ished in <2min wall-clock time in a laptop computer (2.4GHz
Intel Core 2 Duo) and even the most difﬁcult transitions are
ﬁnished in <30min in the same computer. We are working in
a parallel algorithm to explore larger systems with similar
efﬁciency.

3.1 Sampling known intermediate conformations

There are a few cases in PDB of distinct conformations for a
protein, where there is in addition to the start and end conform-
ation a third structure, which is intermediate (at least in terms of
RMSd) between the other two. Following Weiss and Levitt
(2009) we can suggest that in general the third structure can be
near a preferred passing point on the transition between the ex-
treme conformations (i.e. we can consider an ‘intermediate’ in the
transition). Thus, for the five cases where this putative intermedi-
ate is available, we determined transition paths between the two
more diverse conformations. In all cases (Fig. 2) we found
smooth and reasonable transitions, which go in the direction of
the putative intermediate, even for the most difﬁcult cases, where
simpler methods have serious difﬁculties. In small systems
(Ribose Binding Protein, 5/-NT), the transition passes through
the putative intermediate. In larger systems, small RMSd devi-
ations to the putative intermediate are much more difﬁcult to
obtain, partly because of noise introduced by the presence of

long connecting loops, and partly because the intrinsic difﬁculty
of tracing large conformational transitions. Although some large
RMSd values are obtained (due mostly to stochastic loop move-
ments), the potentials used in GOdMD capture better intermedi-
ate states than other state-of-the-art morphing methods
(Supplementary Fig. S3). However, it is clear that the simulation
drives spontaneously the transition toward conformational re-
gions close to the putative intermediate. PROSA proﬁles and
TMScore (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004) of both sampled and pu-
tative experimental intermediates are similar (Supplementary
Figs S9 and S10 and Supplementary Table S2 for details), sup-
porting the quality of the transition path.

3.2 Non-linearity of the transitions

One of the main caveats of biasing methods based on forcing a
regular reduction of RMSd to the target structure (as most
morphing methods) is that they force a linear transition path,
that might be unrealistic (Fig. 3), and that does not provide in-
formation on the bottlenecks in the transition. Our method is
able to detect non-linear transition pathways, and provides in-
formation on where are the bottlenecks, i.e. those points where
the transition seems nearly stopped for long periods, and which
correspond to regions of high rejection rate in the Maxwell
Demon (Supplementary Fig. S11). Interestingly, the method is
also able to disconnect local (measured as % of native contacts)
to global transitions (measured by the RMSd to the target),
showing how for some transitions local rearrangements happen
ﬁrst, while, on the contrary, for other transitions global

sitions (blue) are different, the latter being incorrect, because little target-
native contacts are recovered (despite the low RMSd to target)

movement is before local conformational rearrangements (Figs
3 and 4).

It is worth noting that, the physical nature of the method
guarantees that the guiding engine (NMA-bias metadynamics
and a Maxwell Demon here) finds conformational pathways
that never explore regions of unrealistically large energy. This
guarantees that along all the transitions we sample protein-like
conformations (Fig. 4), avoiding sampling always linear path-
ways that can leads to strong local distortions.

3.3 Introducing experimental information

One of the main advantages of our method is its ﬂexibility, which
makes very easy to introduce the effect of external perturbations
in the transition, or to bias the trajectory by experimental
information.

To show the capabilities of our algorithm, we analysed the
effect of ligand binding in a transition, and also illustrate how
the existence of experimentally validated intermediate can be
used to bias the transition towards preferred pathways. For the
first purpose we studied three additional systems for which
ligand binding is known to displace conformational equilibrium:
D-Allose binding protein (1 gud/lrpj), L-Leucine Binding Protein
(lusg/ lusi) and Osmo-protection protein (1sw5/1sw2). After run-
ning 10 simulations (ﬁve in the absence and ﬁve in the presence
of the ligand), we observed that those trajectories containing
ligand were less efﬁcient to reach the ﬁnal state (Supplementary
Figs S12 and S13 for details). These are just ‘prove of concept’
calculations, but provide encouraging evidence that our simple
and fast algorithm can capture qualitatively the effect of the
ligand in altering conformational pathways. To explore the pos-
sibility to bias GOdMD transitions by using experimental infor-
mation on intermediate we have repeated the study of the very
difficult 1SU4 —> 1IWO transition (Weiss and Levitt, 2009)
assuming that the intermediate structure lVFP corresponds to
a necessary pass-point in the transition. So, we decoupled our
sampling methods to find the transition pathways that better
accommodate this experimental information.

With the same Hamiltonian defined by the end states (A, B;
see Methodological Approach), the Maxwell Demon MD is now
first referred to the experimental intermediate structure (lVFP)
and then switched to the target structure (when sampling of
intermediate structure is converged). With this protocol, we
selected the path closer to the putative intermediate state I.
Figure 5 shows the obtained results. A clear improvement on
the sampling of I is observed, showing that while the potential

energy surface is deﬁned considering only A and B, the transition
derived is fully compatible with the presence of the putative inter-
mediate I.

Note that the new bias introduced in the trajectory by the
experimental restrain does not impact dramatically on the
energy, and it even improves energy relaxation toward the ﬁnal
state (Fig. 5).

4 CONCLUSION

We present GOdMD, a new method to trace conformational
transition at the CG level. The method uses the fast CG dMD
algorithm coupled to two biasing methods: (i) metadynamics
adapted to follow proteins easiest deformation pattern, and (ii)
a Metropolis-based Maxwell Demon algorithm. The method is
fast and, contrary to many other approaches, always finds a
smooth transition path when tested in a large dataset of transi-
tions. Obtained trajectories maintain the covalent structure of the
protein avoiding also unfavourable contacts, sampling intermedi-
ate structures with ‘protein-like’ properties, a clear advantage
with respect to usual morphing schemes. The method is ex-
tremely ﬂexible and can be easily adapted to introduce the
effect of external perturbations in the transition or to bias
the transition using experimental information. Limitations of
the method are likely to be coupled to its CG nature that pre-
cludes the derivation of atomistic information on the transition.
The approach is then expected to be especially powerful to
obtain rough transition pathways that will be further refined
by atomistic MD-based algorithms. A computer program

implementing our method is publicly available as a web server
at mmb.irbbarcelona.org/GOdMD.

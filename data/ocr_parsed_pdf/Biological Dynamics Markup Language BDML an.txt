Abstract

Motivation: Recent progress in live—cell imaging and modeling techniques has resulted in gener—
ation of a large amount of quantitative data (from experimental measurements and computer
simulations) on spatiotemporal dynamics of biological objects such as molecules, cells and organ—
isms. Although many research groups have independently dedicated their efforts to developing
software tools for visualizing and analyzing these data, these tools are often not compatible with
each other because of different data formats.

Results: We developed an open unified format, Biological Dynamics Markup Language (BDML; cur—
rent version: 0.2), which provides a basic framework for representing quantitative biological dy—
namics data for objects ranging from molecules to cells to organisms. BDML is based on
Extensible Markup Language (XML). Its advantages are machine and human readability and exten—
sibility. BDML will improve the efficiency of development and evaluation of software tools for data
visualization and analysis.

Availability and implementation: A specification and a schema file for BDML are freely available
online at http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/bdml/.

niques; quantitative spatiotemporal dynamics of biological objects
such as molecules, cells and organisms can be obtained from experi-
mental measurements and computer simulations (Keller, 2013;
Mogilner et 111., 2006; Oates et (11., 2009). Such quantitative data
can provide us with new opportunities to analyze biological dy-
namics through various types of computational methods; these data
would also provide a rich resource for understanding the mechan-
isms of biological systems.

A wide variety of quantitative biological dynamics data can be
directly obtained from experimental measurements by using live-cell
imaging and digital image processing; for example, cell division

et (11., 2012; Kyoda et (11., 2013; Sarov et (11., 2012). Similarly; quan-
titative data can be obtained for embryogenesis in Dr'osoplailtz mela-
nogtzster (Keller et (11., 2010; Supatto et (11., 2009) and zebrafish
(Keller et (11., 2008) and for behavioral dynamics in adult (Lelegmzs
(Cronin et (11., 2005; Yemini et (11., 2013). Quantitative data can also
be obtained from computer simulations; e.g. single-molecule dy-
namics in Escherichia coli (Arjunan and Tomita, 2010) and microtu-
bule-dependent nuclear dynamics in (Lelegmzs embryos (Kimura and
Onami, 2005). Although most of these data are publicly available; it
is often difficult to reuse them because of their intricate structure
and the lack of detailed explanations of their formats.

Biological Dynamics Markup Language (BDML): an open format for representing quantitative biological dynamics data 1045

 

Although various software tools have been developed independ—
ently for different types of quantitative data, they are often not com—
patible with each other as they tend to use different data formats.
For example, dataset—specific software tools have been developed
for visualization of cell division dynamics in Celegzms embryos
(Boyle et al., 2006; Hamahashi et al., 2005; Kyoda et al., 2013), but
they are not interchangeable and it is difficult to reuse these software
tools to visualize different datasets. Similarly, separate software
tools have been developed to analyze the dynamics of Celegzms and
zebrafish embryos (Keller et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2013).

One of the solutions is to develop a unified format for represent—
ing quantitative biological dynamics data. Similar problems with the
data formats existed in the field of systems biology, and various data
formats have been developed to solve the problems. CellML is de—
signed to represent biological models using algebraic and differential
equations and associated meta—information (Hedley et 41., 2001).
SBML is designed for representation and exchange of biochemical
network models (Hucka et 41., 2003). Both CellML and SBML are
based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) (http://www.w3.org/
TR/2008/REC—xml—20081126/). FieldML is used to represent para—
meterized spatial fields such as finite element method models
(Britten et 41., 2013). It is based on XML and also supports HDFS, a
hierarchical binary format that allows the data to be accessed more
efficiently. Combined with CellML, FieldML can provide a com—
plete vocabulary for describing models at a range of resolutions
from the cellular level to the whole—organ level.

MAGE—ML (Spellman et al., 2002), MAGE—TAB (Rayner et al.,
2006), MINiML (Barrett et al., 2007), szL (Martens et al., 2011)
and BioSignalML (Brooks et al., 2011) are formats for representing
experimental results. MAGE—ML, MAGE—TAB and MINiML are
formats for sharing microarray data; they follow the MIAME guide—
lines (Brazma et al., 2001). MAGE—ML and MINiML are both
XML—based formats. The advantage of MAGE—ML is that it allows
easy development of database applications, whereas that of
MINiML is its simplicity. MAGE—TAB is a simple spreadsheet—based
format for representing microarray data and associated meta—
information to address the needs of experimental biologists. szL
is an open format using XML and binary formats for storage and ex—
change of mass spectrometry data. It allows storage of both spectral
and chromatographic data as binary format data encoded into base
64 strings and includes an index to allow random access to the data.
BioSignalML uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for
encoding and storing of biomedical signals such as electrocardio—
grams and associated meta—information. It stores the signals as a se—
quence of time—varying data points in their native binary formats,
e.g. HDFS.

SBRML (Dada et al., 2010) is an XML—based format for repre—
senting both experimental and simulation results. It focuses on asso—
ciating systems biology data, such as microarray data, with cellular
models. It also supports both spreadsheet—like data and multidimen—
sional data cubes. However, none of the formats mentioned above
were designed to represent three—dimensional (3D) spatial and tem—
poral dynamics of biological objects. Representing quantitative bio—
logical dynamics data using existing formats would be difficult and
inefficient. Therefore, development of a new data format is needed.

In this study, we developed an open format for representing
quantitative biological dynamics data, Biological Dynamics Markup
Language (BDML). BDML can describe a wide variety of spatiotem—
poral dynamics of biological objects at different levels, from mol—
ecules to cells to organisms. The biological objects are represented
as predefined geometric entities such as points, lines, circles, spheres,
faces and combinations of the above. BDML is based on XML.

The BDML format is both machine and human readable, which
should enable computational biologists to efficiently develop and
evaluate software tools. It is also extensible, which should enable
flexible future support for new types of quantitative biological dy—
namics data. The current version of BDML is 0.2. We expect that
the BDML framework will dramatically accelerate the analysis of
quantitative biological dynamics data, which in turn will allow us to
gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of biological systems.

2 Methods

2.1 Overview

BDML is based on XML, which is in turn a derivative of the
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). SGML is an
international standard for information processing. It defines a set of
markup tags to describe the document structure and other attributes.
XML provides a subset of SGML markup tags and is now widely ac—
cepted by the bioinformatics community as a standard data format
(Achard et al., 2001).

A specification or grammar written in XML is called a schema.
A schema defines an XML document, allowing easy validation of
the syntax and making the document self—contained, i.e. an XML
document does not require additional files or documents to describe
the data structure within the document.

Our first requirement for a unified data format was sufficient
machine and human readability to allow computational biologists
to accelerate software development and evaluation. The machine
readability of XML with a large number of open libraries and
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) enables efficient soft—
ware development and evaluation. The human readability of XML
allows experimental biologists to easily access and understand the
content of quantitative data. Our second requirement was flexibility
and extensibility. The format needs to be flexible enough to allow
future extension to accommodate new types of quantitative data.
The extensibility of XML enables the BDML format to support flex—
ible data extension. Therefore, XML was chosen as the basis for
BDML.

A BDML file usually consists of six top—level elements: info,
ontology, summary, contact, methods and data. The info
element provides information about the BDML file, whereas the
ontology, summary, contact and methods elements represent
meta—information of the quantitative data. The data element con—
tains the quantitative data obtained from either experimental meas—
urements or computer simulations.

Info. A short description of the content of the BDML file. It includes
a unique identifier for each BDML file and details of its license.

Ontology. A description of the associations between terms in BDML
and those from external ontology sources.

Summary. A short summary of the quantitative biological dynamics
data described in the BDML file.

Contact. Detailed information about the corresponding author of
the BDML file. Contact name, affiliation and e—mail address must
be included with each BDML file.

Methods. A description of the method used to obtain the quantita—
tive data. The description should provide enough detail to allow

Biological Dynamics Markup Language (BDML): an open format for representing quantitative biological dynamics data 1051

 

dynamics by using more than one BDML file. Therefore, a future
version of the BDML format will extend the BDML schema to sup—
port such information. As meta—information about genetic and
chemical perturbations can be useful for other XML—based data for—
mats such as MINiML (Barrett et al., 2007), szL (Martens et al.,
2011), OME (Allan et al., 2012), CellML (Hedley et al., 2001),
SBML (Hucka et al., 2003) and SBRML (Dada et al., 2010), we aim
to collaborate with these projects to incorporate this information in
a future release.

Integration and comparative analysis of various types of quanti—
tative data are straightforward when they are represented in the
BDML format. Such integration has the potential to lead to new in—
sights into biological mechanisms; for example, an integrated study
of the dynamics of cell morphology and protein activity has
explored the relationship between biophysical phenomena and bio—
chemical signaling (Tsukada et al., 2008). Comparison of experi—
mental measurements and computer simulations has elucidated the
mechanisms of various kinds of biological dynamics (Aliee et al.,
2012; Grill et al., 2001; Kimura and Onami, 2005; Kozlowski et al.,
2007; Krieg et al., 2008; Pecreaux et al., 2006; Rauzi et al., 2008;
Stoma et al., 2011). BDML will facilitate such comparative analysis
and comparison of the data from different laboratories. We believe
that the BDML format will widen the range of scientific approaches
to understanding biological systems.

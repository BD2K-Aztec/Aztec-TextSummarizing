ABSTRACT

Motivation: Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is one of the most
versatile tools to study protein folding and to validate the proper fold of
purified proteins. Here, we aim to provide a readily accessible, user-
friendly and platform-independent tool capable of analysing multiple
CD datasets of virtually any format and returning results as high-quality
graphical output to the user.

Results: CAPITO (CD Anaylsis and Plotting Tool) is a novel web
server-based tool for analysing and plotting CD data. It allows reli-
able estimation of secondary structure content utilizing different
approaches. CAPITO accepts multiple CD datasets and, hence, is
well suited for a wide application range such as the analysis of tem-
perature or pH-dependent (un)folding and the comparison of mutants.

1 INTRODUCTION

The past 20 years have witnessed a dramatic growth of the
number of high-resolution protein structures deposited in the
protein data bank (PDB: Berman et al., 2000). The progress in
structural biology has been driven by developments in recombin-
ant protein expression technology, as well as by advances in
methodology, data analysis and bioinformatics. Escherichia coli
is, so far, the most widely used host for structural studies, which
in turn require signiﬁcant amounts of recombinant protein.
Before resource-intensive detailed structural and functional
studies, it is extremely helpful, if not essential, to validate the
proper fold of puriﬁed recombinant proteins and one of the
most versatile tools to study protein fold(ing) constitutes circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Compared with X-ray crystallog-
raphy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the
structural information obtained from CD is limited. However,
CD spectroscopy carries a number of advantages: it is a well-
established label-free technique requiring comparably small
amounts of material, and a short time is necessary for assessing
structural parameters of proteins like secondary structure, con-
formational changes, (un)folding and interactions (Whitmore
et al., 2010).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A broad range of mathematical methods have been devised to
extract structural information from CD spectra to provide for an
estimate of the secondary structure composition of proteins Via
multilinear regression (Greenﬁeld and Fasman, 1969), singular
value decomposition (Hennessey and Johnson, 1981), ridge
regression (Provencher and Glockner, 1981), principal
component factor analysis (Pribic, 1994), convex constraint ana-
lysis (Perczel et al., 1991), neural network-based analysis
(Andrade et al., 1993; Bohm et al., 1992) and the self consistent
method (Sreerama and Woody, 1993), respectively. All these
methods are based on the assumption that the CD spectrum of
a given protein represents a linear combination of basis
spectra. Different secondary structural elements give rise to
bands characteristic in wavelength and intensity (Raussens
et al., 2003).

[911 = 21251" + noise (1)

The CD spectrum of a given protein can be represented by the
molar ellipticity [@h as a function of wavelength i, where f” is
the fraction of each secondary structure It, and Sin is the ellipti-
city at each wavelength of each nth secondary structural element
(Greenﬁeld, 2006). The sum of all fractional weights 2f" is
equal to 1 in constrained ﬁts.

The quality of the output of the aforementioned methods relies
on the availability of a reference database of CD spectra of pro-
teins whose 3D structure is known (Lees et al., 2006). With the
advent of the Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank (PCDDB),
a public repository for far ultraviolet (far-UV) and synchrotron
radiation CD spectral data and their associated experimental
metadata, the number of publicly available CD spectra increased
enormously (Lees et al., 2006; Wallace et al., 2006; Whitmore et
al., 2011). In the PCDDB, each entry contains sequence and
experimental information for the respective protein and includes
the PDB code for proteins of which 3D structures are available.

During the recent past, different web services (Louis Jeune
et al., 2012; Raussens et al., 2003; Whitmore and Wallace,
2004, 2008) or programmes (Bohm et al., 1992; Johnson, 1999)
for analysing of CD data and estimating secondary structure
content became available. Recently, Janes and co-workers
(Klose et al., 2012) launched the tool DichroMatch for matching
spectra against reference data. Here, we describe a novel web
server-based tool combining different methods for estimating
secondary structure content and analysing far-UV CD data
based on a selected set of far-UV CD data as available from
the PCDDB.

2 METHODS

2.1 CD Data collection and processing

Lysozyme (chicken), cytochrome C (horse), ,B-amylase (sweet potato) and
carbonic anhydrase II (bovine) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich at the
highest purity available. Recombinant ubiquitin (human) was provided
by Thomas Seiboth (FLI Jena) and the ,81 immunoglobulin-binding
domain of protein G (GBl) was expressed and puriﬁed as described
(Bellstedt et al., 2012). All proteins were dissolved in 50 mM borate (cyto-
chrome C, ﬁ-amylase and carbonic anhydrase II), pH 7.5, or exchanged
into pure water (lysozyme, ubiquitin and GBl) using NAP-S columns
(GE Healthcare). The protein concentrations were in the 10 uM range
and veriﬁed spectrophotometrically at 280 nm with extinction coefﬁcients
calculated using ProtParam (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/). CD
spectra were collected on a JASCO J-710 CD spectropolarimeter at
4°C in a 1mm quartz cuvette. The instrument was calibrated with
D-lO-camphorsulphonic acid. Each CD spectrum represents the average
of 10 accumulated scans at 100 nm/min with a 1 nm slit width and a time
constant of 1 s for a nominal resolution of 1.7 nm. Data were collected
between 185 and 260nm with the appropriate buffer and solvent back-
ground subtraction. No further zeroing was applied (after background
subtraction) because none of the six proteins we used for the experimental
part exhibited, for our chosen 10 uM concentration range, a CD between
260 and 320 nmias tested in preliminary experiments. We tested a whole
range of scan rates and time constants and did not notice signiﬁcant
changes in CD and the outcome of the CAPITO analysis.

2.2 Reference datasets

For this study, we used the PCDDB dataset of October 2012 as a well-
calibrated, wide wavelength range reference dataset containing a large
number of proteins, which effectively cover a large combination of
secondary structures and fold space (Lees et al., 2006). That database
does not include structures of oligopeptides. From this dataset, only
entries linked to an existing PDB code were selected. For multiple entries
referring to the same PDB code, only the spectral data recorded at the
lowest temperature were used. Our selected dataset contains 107 entries
(Supplementary Table S1). Note that for each PCDDB entry, the values
for or, 310 and n—helix are summarized as helical (h), ,B-strand (b) also
includes ,B-bridge and bonded turn, bend, loop and irregular are com-
bined as irregular (i), respectively.

In addition, as reference for signiﬁcantly unfolded and pre-molten
globule states, 95 datasets containing the CD values for 1:200 and
222nm were used as published (Uversky, 2002).

2.3 CAPITO input

Spectral data in millidegrees or mean residue CD extinction coefﬁcient
(A6) or mean residue ellipticity ([6]), respectively, can be submitted in
different data formats as text (txt) ﬁle: AVIV 60DS, Aviv, Aviv CDS, BP
(Wallace and Teeters, 1987; Whitmore and Wallace, 2004) and Jasco.
Example ﬁles are available through the CAPITO web page. The user
also has the possibility to manually enter or copy/paste spectral data,
where wavelength and CD data are separated by a blank or a tab stop
with one wavelength per row. In addition, it is possible to upload CD
data collected with either smaller or larger step size than lnm. The de-
fault input data dimension is in millidegrees. Following input of add-
itional experimental parameters such as protein concentration, cuvette
pathlength and the number of amino acids, millidegrees are converted
to either mean residue CD extinction coefﬁcient (A6 in M’1 cm’l) or
mean residue ellipticity ([O] in deg cm2 dmol’l). Optionally, the amino
acid sequence can be submitted as one-letter code for prediction of sec-
ondary structure using an implemented Chou-Fasman-algorithm
(Chou and Fasman, 1978).

2.4 CAPITO output

CAPITO provides for the spectral data converted into either A6 or [O] as
a graph (for review see Greenfield, 2006; Kelly et al., 2005; Sreerama and
Woody, 2004). In addition, the spectral values at 200 versus 222nm are
plotted for an estimate of the folding state of the protein in question. The
prediction of the secondary structure elements is realised via extraction of
information from a calculated set of basis spectra and a matching-based
approach as described later in the text. Of all CD spectra in our reference
dataset, the three curves best matching the submitted query are plotted as
well. All graphs can be downloaded as high-quality portable network
graphic (png) ﬁles.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

One of the most widely used applications of CD is the estimation
of protein secondary structure content from far-UV CD spectra.
Not only the relative proportion of secondary structure (e. g. hel-
ical, ﬂ-strand and others) provides for a characteristic contribu-
tion to the far-UV CD spectrum of a protein but also aromatic
and sulphur-containing side chains, the length of a-helices and
the twist in ﬂ-sheets (Johnson, 1999). A large reference dataset is
necessary to cover all these features for analysis. In principle, the
number of CD spectra in a reference dataset deﬁnes the number
of structural features that can be determined. Based on consid-
erations of Hennessey and Johnson (1981) and Johnson (1992,
1999), the number of different secondary structural elements sig-
niﬁcantly depends on the shortest wavelength used in a CD spec-
trum. For example, a lower spectral limit set to 190nm reduces
information content so that three to four different structural
elements can be safely predicted. As using lower wavelengths
might be impractical, in particular for biochemists, we restrict
the evaluation of the CD data entered into CAPITO to three
structural elements: the combination of a, 310 and 7r-he1ix as
helical content (h), ﬂ-strand (b) also includes ﬂ-bridge and
bonded turn, bend and loop are included in the structural feature
irregular (i), respectively.

3.1 Reference dataset derived basis spectra

The optical activity of individual secondary structural elements is
assumed to be additive and can be expressed as given in
Equation (2). At any particular wavelength II, the sum of f’s is
equal to 1 and all fs 3 0 for a constrained approach.

[911 =fhl®lm +fbl®lm +fil®lii (2)

If the relative proportion for the secondary structural elements is
known (from an X-ray or NMR spectroscopy-based protein
structure) and the corresponding CD spectrum is at hand, it is
possible to calculate the ellipticity for any given wavelength
within the range of the CD spectrum. The least-square method
was used for solving the f’s from a system of equations for
our reference dataset. Solving the matrix [Equation (3)] by
least-square fitting for each selected protein j in the reference
dataset, a calculated [®]h,,,,,- for each secondary structure elem-
ent, is returned over the wavelength range of 18(L240 nm
(Supplementary Table S2). [O] for each secondary structure
element is plotted in Figure 1 against the wavelength.

With this approach, we derived three basis CD spectra (helical,
ﬂ-strand and irregular) using our reference dataset. For the
helical basis spectrum, the presence of one positive band at
194nm and two major negative bands at 210 and 222nm are
most evident. This is consistent with basis CD spectra derived
by others (Brahms and Brahms, 1980; Chen and Yang, 1971;
Chen et al., 1974, 1972; Hennessey and Johnson, 1981; Perczel
et al., 1992b; Reed and Reed, 1997; Sreerama and Woody, 1993;
Toumadje et al., 1992). The ﬂ-strand basis spectrum is character-
ized by a less intensive positive band at 197nm and a negative
band at 217 nm. A negative band at 197 nm and a weak positive
band at 223 nm are features of the irregular basis spectrum. The
irregular structure closely resembles that of polypeptides in ex-
tended poly-L-proline II-like structures (Woody, 1992). Also the
irregular structure fits well the CD curve for poly(Pro-Lys—Leu—
Lys-Leu),, in salt-free solution as model compound for unordered
conformation (Brahms and Brahms, 1980). A plot overlay of
different basis spectra in comparison with those calculated in
this work are given in the Supplementary Data (Supplementary
Figs 81753).

In a simple model, the ellipticity of one secondary structure
content is related to certain wavelengths. For identifying wave-
lengths best representing secondary structure content, a con-
strained approach was performed. With the three basis spectra
([®]h,,,,,-) as derived from solving the aforementioned matrix
[Equation (3)], every possible combination of f’s [Equation (4)]
with the boundary condition [Equation (5)] was calculated using
Equation (2).

structure content was calculated, and the resulting slope of the linear
regression of the auto-correlationias a measure of accuracy of the pre-
dictioniis plotted against the respective wavelength

fh+fb+f1=1 (5)

Subsequently, the minimum of the square difference between the
calculated [@]cal and the observed molar ellipticity [®]0,,s in the
reference dataset was determined. This was carried out for all
proteins of the reference dataset for each wavelength in the range
of 18(L240 nm. For each wavelength, the best matching combin-
ation of f’s was plotted against the experimental f values to assess
the correlation between calculated and experimental data points,
and a linear regression analysis was performed (Figs 2 and 3).
For a perfect correlation, the actual slope of the linear regres-
sion of the auto-correlation would be one, and the closer the
slope is approaching unity, the higher the quality of the predic-
tion of secondary structure elements for a given wavelength.
The results of the linear regression analysis are plotted against
the wavelength. Maxima for the prediction of secondary struc-
ture contents are found for helical at 220nm, for ﬂ-strand at
206nm and for irregular at 199nm, respectively (Fig. 2). To
extract information about the secondary structure content from
a CD curve, the three basis spectra ([®]h,,,,,-) as derived from
matrix [Equation (3)] were used in Equation (2) at defined wave-
lengths as follows. For prediction of the helical content, the
calculated molar ellipticity of a pure helix [@]h at 220nm was
used. By varying the fh, f}, and f,- [Equation (4)], with the con-
straint that the sum of the f’s is equal to one [Equation (5)], the
difference between the calculated and the observed [@]220m of a
query protein was minimized. The fh resulting from this solution
represents the helical content of the respective query protein. The
whole procedure was then independently repeated at 206 nm, and
the resulting ﬁ, at this wavelength is considered as the predicted
ﬂ-strand content. The irregular content (fi) was calculated at
199nm in the same manner. In summary, for the prediction of
the content of each of the three secondary structure elements,
Equation (2) is used. Based on the maxima found in the linear
regression analysis aforementioned (Fig. 2), as a measure for the
accuracy of prediction, the programme extracts helical content at

Fig. 3. Cross-validation of the basis spectra method: the secondary struc-
ture content for each of the proteins in the reference dataset was calcu-
lated and plotted against the secondary structure content available in the
PCDDB. Helical content was obtained at 220 nm, ,B-strand at 206 nm and
irregular at 199nm. The hatched line indicates 10 and 20% deviation
from the ideal auto-correlation (dotted line). Solid line represents the
linear regression of the calculated auto-correlation

220nm, ﬂ-strand at 206 nm and irregular at 199nm only
(neglecting the respective contributions of the other two elements
at those wavelengths). Hence, the sum for the three secondary
structural elements can differ from 100%. Based on the calcu-
lated secondary structural content, optionally a theoretical CD
curve can be back calculated and plotted against the query curve,
and the goodness of ﬁt between the two curves is presented
as normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD)
(Supplementary Equation $1) to the user, where an ideal ﬁt
would approach an NRMSD of zero (Mao et al., 1982). To
evaluate the quality of the model, a cross-validation was carried
out. For each reference protein in the dataset, the secondary
structure content was calculated as described earlier in the text
and compared with deposited data within the PCDDB. This pre-
diction was repeated for all spectra within our reference dataset.
The calculated secondary structure contents are plotted against
the actual values (Fig. 3). From this, it becomes evident that this
procedure delivers a reliable estimate of helical, ﬂ-strand and
irregular secondary structure content for a given protein.

As illustrated in Figure 3, the cross-validation provides the
most accurate results for helical secondary structure. Only 7 of
107 validated proteins are beyond the margin of 20% deviation.
The prediction of ﬂ-strand secondary structure is somewhat less
accurate than for helical content and shows that eight proteins of
our reference dataset are not within the range of 20% deviation.
Irregular structures (neither helix nor ﬂ-strand) adopt a wide
range of backbone angles exhibiting CD spectra of heteroge-
neous character. This hampers the accurate estimation of such
secondary structure elements. With our approach, only four pro-
teins of our reference dataset are not in the range of 20% devi-
ation for the prediction of irregular structures. The irregular
structure content in our reference data is not spread over the
range observed for helical or ﬂ-strand content. In such a situ-
ation, outliers have a more significant inﬂuence on the linear

regression, resulting in a slope further away from approaching
unity.

This approach appears somewhat less accurate in comparison
with other methods [SELCON3 (Sreerama and Woody, 1993),
CDSSTR (Johnson, 1999) or CONTIN (Provencher and
Gléckner, 1981), Table 1], but the results and their validation
strongly suggest that the input of measured values at three wave-
lengths (220nm for helical, 206 nm for ﬂ-strand and 199 nm for
irregular) are sufﬁcient to describe the information contained
within a given CD spectrum.

3.2 Matching-based prediction: nearest-neighbour and
area difference method

Under the general assumption that proteins with similar second-
ary structure content give rise to comparable CD curves, we
tested alternative prediction methods. If the reference dataset
effectively covers a large combination of secondary structures
and fold space, matched reference proteins should comprise the
actual secondary structure content of a query protein. To test
this hypothesis, we used two methods to evaluate a query CD
spectrum against our reference dataset. For either method, the
query CD spectrum is compared with each CD spectrum of the
reference dataset. As standard pattern recognition method, we
used a k-nearest—neighbour algorithm (Cover, 1968; Kowalski
and Bender, 1972) in the following two approaches.

For the nearest-neighbour approach, for each wavelength
within the range of 18(L240 nm, the 25 best matching reference
curves deﬁned by closest proximity were determined. Here, prox-
imity is deﬁned as the 1D distance between the query and the
reference CD spectra at each wavelength. Subsequently, the fre-
quency (N) of a given reference protein among the 25 nearest
neighbours to the query protein is used for ranking.

To assess the lowest area difference (AD), the best matching
reference curves for the range of 18(L240 nm were selected. AD
was deﬁned as shown in Equation (6).

AD.- 2  (([®lQ,1 — [QIRELLD X lnm)2 (6)

AD (in deg cm2 dmol’l nm) represents the CD curve area dif-
ference between query (Q) and the reference (Ref) protein, where
[®]Q, X is the molar ellipticity of the query protein at wavelength
II, and [®]R,,ﬂ X is the molar ellipticity of the protein i in the ref-
erence dataset at the same wavelength II, respectively. In exten-
sion of the rotational strength approach presented by Klose et a].
(2012), the AD approach here evaluates in lnm steps over the
wavelength range A the difference in area between a reference and
a query curve rather than the area of a given CD curve per se. It,
hence, also includes an (although indirect) evaluation of the
shape of the query CD curve. The AD output provides the
best ranked CD reference curves with the smallest area differ-
ence. The NRMSD (Supplementary Equation Sl) between the
best matching reference CD spectra and the query CD spectra is
calculated and shown for comparison. AD and NRMSD are
always calculated over the same wavelength range as provided
by the query dataset. However, the NRMSD is neither used for
matching nor for ranking of identiﬁed hits.

To validate our approach for extracting structural information
by matching query and reference CD spectra an auto-correlation

was performed. For this purpose, single-reference spectra were
removed in turn from the reference dataset, and matching was
performed with the remaining spectra against the structure con-
tent as derived from the removed spectrum. The structural con-
tents of the three best matching reference proteins are combined
to give a range for fh, f}, and f,. In this approach, the secondary
structure content of a protein in question is not deﬁned by single
calculated value but by a range of secondary structural content
derived from the three best matching reference proteins. This
prediction was repeated for all the spectra within the reference
dataset.

Figure 4 depicts the cross-validation for the structural content
predicted by the nearest-neighbour method (a) and by the area
difference method (b), respectively. Both methods deliver a reli-
able and comparable estimate of helical, ﬂ-strand and irregular
content for a given protein. Only a few outliers in the prediction
of helical and ﬂ-strand content are not within the margin of 20%
deviation. Surprisingly, for irregular content, all validated pro-
teins fall within the boundary of 20% deviation. The range of
secondary structural content present in the three best matches
covers in most cases the actual content of the query protein. A
consequence of this is that an increasing number of protein struc-
tures in the reference database will further restrict the range

covered by the three best matches and, hence, lead to an
increased accuracy of the secondary structure content for a
given protein as predicted by CAPITO.

3.3 Validation by protein identiﬁcation and comparison
with other programmes

Whitmore et a]. (2011) mentioned the idea of identifying proteins
based on their CD spectral characteristics, i.e. if a protein is
deposited in a database, it should be possible to identify this
protein based on its CD curve. Here, we recorded CD spectra
of freshly prepared solutions of six different proteins (see
Section 2) and processed the recorded CD data with the
CAPITO web server. Our reference dataset contains five
(ﬂ-amylase, carbonic anhydrase II, cytochrome C, lysozyme
and ubiquitin) of six of the selected proteins used here. As seen
in Figure 5a (and also Supplementary Fig. S4), our matching-
based prediction allows for the identiﬁcation of proteins present
in a reference dataset%ven under buffer conditions slightly dif-
ferent from the ones in the reference dataset. A11 tested proteins
were identiﬁed as indicated by the best score (Fig. 5a and
Supplementary Fig. S4).

Fig. 4. Cross-validation of the nearest-neighbour method (a) and area
difference method (b). The secondary structure content for each of the
proteins in the reference dataset was calculated and plotted against its
actual secondary structure content. The top-ranked hit is plotted as dot,
error bars connect second- and third-ranked hit. The hatched line indi-
cates 10 and 20% deviation from the ideal auto-correlation (dotted line)

To compare our method of secondary structure prediction, we
used our recorded and processed spectra to a selection of other
available programmes and web services (Béhm et al., 1992; Louis
Jeune et al., 2012; Raussens et al., 2003; Sreerama and Woody,
2000). The results (Table 1) were compared with secondary struc-
ture assignments deposited in the Protein Data Bank, which in
turn are based on the DSSP programme (Kabsch and Sander,
1983). A standard set of reference CD data was tested to com-
pare the accuracy of CAPITO with other available programmes.
The standard set consisted of 16 proteins and poly-L-glutamic
acid (Sreerama and Woody, 1993). CAPITO returns a good
correlation coefﬁcient for the helical and ﬂ-strand secondary
structure elements found in the X-ray structure of the 16 test
proteins (Table 2). As most programmes that rely on a protein
dataset, CAPITO is not suitable for evaluating helical and
ﬂ-strand conformation content for long homopolymeric peptides
such as poly-L-lysine, as our reference dataset does not include
such homopolymers.

Fig. 5. Experimental validation: (a) a CD spectrum of ,B-amylase (sweet
potato) was recorded and analysed with CAPITO (black curve). As an
example, the graphical output for the area difference method is shown.
The best-matching CD spectra of the reference dataset are ,B-amylase
(blue), the second best alkaline phosphatase (green) and the third best
hit peroxidase C1 (red), respectively. (b) Recorded CD spectra for GB1 at
different temperatures. Upper panel: CD curve for the starting tempera-
ture of 4°C is depicted in black, other temperatures as indicated in the
inset. CD spectrum of GB1 after heat treatment and cooled down to 4°C
(GB1 a.HT) is shown in orange. Lower panel: CD values at A 2200 nm
plotted versus the values at A = 222 nm to deduce the folding state of GB1
at the respective temperatures

3.4 Monitoring protein folding under different conditions

Different folding states of polypeptide chains are characterized
by speciﬁc shapes of their far-UV CD spectrum. For example,
unfolded polypeptides or proteins containing mainly irregular
structural elements show a spectral minimum in the Vicinity of
200nm and an ellipticity close to zero in the Vicinity of 222nm.
Helical proteins show a characteristic double minimum at 222
and 208 nm and an intensive maximum near 195 nm (Fig. 1). The
‘double wavelength’ plot ([O]222 versus [®]200) as described
(Uversky, 2002) allows the direct Visualization of the folding
state of a protein for different conditions (e.g. temperature,
pH, buffer type and ionic strength). Here, we use this plotting
routine within CAPITO to carry out an assessment of the GB1
folding state as a function of temperature. As shown in Figure 5b
(lower panel) from the double wavelength plot, it can be con-
cluded that GB1 shows a well folded state at lower temperatures,

which is stable even at higher temperatures. At 80°C, a transition
from the native folded state to the molten globule is observed.
The temperature shift from 80°C to 90°C changes the GB1 fold
from a molten globule towards a pre-molten globule state. This
observation is consistent with the previous determined midpoint
of denaturation at ~75°C (Alexander et al., 1992; Minor and
Kim, 1994). Although, this does not replace a detailed analysis
(e. g. melting curve), it allows for a quick and coarse estimation of
a transition point enabling analysis of unstable proteins, which
may not withstand a time-consuming detailed analysis.

4 CONCLUSION

We have developed CAPITO, a novel web server-based analysis
tool for interpreting CD spectra. It allows the simultaneous
evaluation of multiple datasets. Hence, it is suitable for the
investigation of a protein in question under different conditions
(temperature, pH, buffer solvent and mutations). Our
approaches (basis spectra and matching-based method) to ex-
tract secondary structure information from a CD spectrum
take advantage of a recent signiﬁcant increase in the availability
of well-calibrated far-UV CD spectra linked to available tertiary
structures. The accuracy of our methods in predicting (ii-helical,
ﬂ-strand or irregular content is reliable compared with other

frequently used programmes or web services. In summary, we
here provide a freely accessible, user-friendly and robust tool for
the analysis of CD spectra.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: At the core of transcriptome analyses of cancer is a chal-
lenge to detect molecular differences affiliated with disease pheno-
types. This approach has led to remarkable progress in identifying
molecular signatures and in stratifying patients into clinical groups.
Yet, despite this progress, many of the identified signatures are not ro-
bust enough to be clinically used and not consistent enough to provide
a follow-up on molecular mechanisms.

Results: To address these issues, we introduce PhenoNet, a novel
algorithm for the identification of pathways and networks associated
with different phenotypes. PhenoNet uses two types of input data:
gene expression data (RMA, RPKM, FPKM, etc.) and phenotypic in-
formation, and integrates these data with curated pathways and
protein—protein interaction information. Comprehensive iterations
across all possible pathways and subnetworks result in the identifica-
tion of key pathways or subnetworks that distinguish between the two
phenotypes.

Availability and implementation: Matlab code is available upon

1 INTRODUCTION

Beginning in the mid-1990s, through unique conventions on
public sharing and through the concentrated efforts of different
groups around the world, an ever-growing abundance of tran-
scriptome proﬁling sets of data have provided the systems medi-
cine community with the foundations of what is now referred to
as molecular signatures. Many of these signatures have concen-
trated on identifying sets of genes that classify patients into rele-
vant clinical afﬁliations, followed by the use of enrichment tools
to further afﬁliate sets of genes with biological processes.
Additional layers of mechanism understanding have been intro-
duced with the use of network metrics to quantify the orche-
strated behavior of genes within the transcriptome (Ben-Hamo
and Efroni, 2013; Emmert-Streib et al., 2012). These network
approaches and the resulting insight suggest that biological, cel-
lular and disease outcome strongly depend on the complex of
interactions between genes, proteins and other molecules through
different pathways (Ziogas et al., 2011).

The identification of biomarkers that, by deﬁnition, correlate
with phenotypes, is an important task in biomedical research.
By exploring the most signiﬁcant molecular changes between
groups, we may shed light on the structure, centrality, dynamics
and operating principles of the disease network and reveal new
features and structures. The introduction of network-based met-
rics carries with it the possibility of identifying biomarkers that
have been hiding in plain sight (Khatri et al., 2012).

The integration of experimental data and systems-level
approaches, combined with the transition from ‘classic’ molecu-
lar-based analysis to network-based analysis, may be the basis
for a new era of novel clinical implications in personalized medi-
cine and for a deeper understanding of disease behavior.

Proteiniprotein interaction (PPI) networks are well-
established tools in the ﬁeld of systems biology. The Pathway
Interaction Database (PID) (Schaefer et al., 2009), Reactome
(Joshi—Tope et al., 2005) and Biocarta are examples of publicly
available pathway-interaction datasets. By merging the identiﬁ-
cation of differentially expressed genes with curated network in-
formation, key novel and robust subnetworks may be detected as
new biomarkers (Ben-Hamo and Efroni, 2012a, b; Efroni et al.,
2011; Greenblum et al., 2011). Several pathway-level tools are
available for incorporating pathway topology to interpret high-
throughput datasets. For example, PPI spider tool (Antonov
et al., 2009) uses the Monte Carlo simulation procedure to com-
pute the statistical signiﬁcance of an inferred model based on the
topology of the global PPI network. PARADIGM (V aske et al.,
2010) is a method for inferring patient-speciﬁc genetic activities
incorporating curated pathway interactions among genes. This
method predicts the degree to which a pathway’s activities
(e. g. internal gene states, interactions or high-level ‘outputs’)
are altered in a patient using probabilistic inference.
PathOlogist (Greenblum et al., 2011) is one of the few methods
that provide the metrics for quantifying the behavior of inter-
actions in a pathway. Using PathOlogist, every pathway can be
quantiﬁed into a numeric value per sample.

A growing number of pathway-based works have been re-
cently published and focuses on the identiﬁcation of novel prog-
nostic biomarkers. Frohlich (Frohlich, 2011) derived a consensus
signature from seemingly different prognostic gene signatures in
breast cancer by incorporating information on PPIs. They re-
ported that the stability of the signature was signiﬁcantly
higher. Wang and Chen (2011) integrated gene expression data
with PPI information for the development of a network-based
biomarker for lung carcinogenesis. Pierobon et a]. (2009) used
reverse-phase protein microarray analysis of laser capture micro-
dissected CRC tumor specimens to profile broad cell-signaling

pathways in patients who exhibited liver metastasis versus
patients who remained recurrence free after follow-up. Lee
et a]. (2008) integrated pathway information with disease classi-
ﬁcation procedure, to classify disease by looking at the activity
signaling pathways or protein complexes. Su et a]. (2009) pro-
posed a classiﬁcation method based on probabilistic inference of
pathway activities. Teschendorff et a]. (2010) developed a net-
work method for estimating pathway activation in tumors from
model signatures. In a recent work by Li et a]. (2012), the authors
provided a server for identifying network-based biomarkers that
correlate with patient survival data. Kim and Gelenbe (2012)
modiﬁed the Gillespie algorithm by adding the Hill function to
describe protein activation. They applied their algorithm to simu-
late expression data that show switch-like and oscillatory behav-
ior in the metabolite production system of microorganisms.
Here, we have developed PhenoNet (Fig. 1), which is a net-
work-based phenotype classiﬁcation tool that integrates gene ex-
pression data (RMA, RPKM, FPKM, etc.), clinical data and
PPI knowledge for the identiﬁcation of key subnetworks whose
behavior and derived index stratiﬁes the clinical states. PhenoNet
works under the assumption that speciﬁc regulation mechanism
can control speciﬁc phenotype, by doing so PhenoNet is able to
detect phenotype-dependent gene-gene associations. By scanning
all known PPIs, PhenoNet is able to detect a specific single sub-
network with strong regulation in phenotype A and with a lesser

impact regulation in phenotype B. Such associations are identi-
fied through measuring correlation and lack of correlation
among PPI components. Because of the fact that these speciﬁc
regulations are present in only one phenotype, we can assume
that the absent or present of them is meaningful for disease
course.

To the best of our knowledge, PhenoNet is the ﬁrst tool that is
tuned to identify these changes according to their phenotype
afﬁliations. Although available tools are structured to identify
mutation or methylation modiﬁcations across phenotypes, they
are not structured to detect subnetworks that undergo changes in
their gene-gene associations. PhenoNet, while completely uncon-
cerned with mutation or methylation status, is structured to iden-
tify modiﬁcations in associations between gene pairs across a
subnetwork. The identiﬁcation of these changes may be a key
for catalyzing new treatment and understanding specific pheno-
type mechanisms.

At the core of the method is the calculation of correlations
between all known PPIs, PhenoNet is able to identify the most
varied subnetwork that stratiﬁes tested phenotypes. PhenoNet
returns a single subnetwork for every two phenotypes presented.
This network is the most varied between the two phenotypes.

2 METHODS

The algorithm developed by us combines PPI information extracted from
BIOGRID (Stark et al., 2011) and HPRD (Peri et al., 2003) with the PID
(Schaefer et al., 2009), which integrates pathway knowledge from NCI,
Kegg (Ogata et al., 1999) and Biocarta. This modeling strategy was based
on the fact that gene contribution to the network is based on the role
played by the gene and the way the gene inﬂuences its network
neighborhood.

This approach makes use of a baseline model that is constructed using
correlations from curated pathways from the PID (Section 2.1). We, then,
compared this baseline with further extensions of the PPI network.

2.1 Baseline pathway model

Initially, we obtained all interactions and molecules in the pathway. We
then used the gene expression data to calculate the Pearson correlation
for each interaction in the pathway. A pathway score was then obtained
as the absolute average over correlation coefficients in the pathway. This
process was iterated throughout all pathways and across the set of patient
samples. It was done simultaneously for both sets of samples to identify
the most signiﬁcant subnetwork that stratiﬁes the two phenotype groups.
Each pathway thus culminated in two scores: one score for its value in
one phenotype and another score for its value in the other phenotype.
Then, using Student’s t-test, the P-value to describe the differences be-
tween the pathway scores in the two phenotypes, was obtained. When all
pathway scores were calculated, the ‘best’ pathway was selected. This
pathway set the threshold for the PPI network analysis that followed.

2.2 PPI network model

The PPI network compiled by us was composed of 10489 genes and
62 643 interactions from the databases detailed above. We seeded the
algorithm by identifying the single interaction whose correlation was
most different between the two phenotypes. On identifying this single
interaction, we searched the full PPI network using a greedy search,
and built a subnetwork of interacting genes. This subnetwork combines
from the associations with the mo st signiﬁcant difference between the two
phenotypes. Unlike the pathway-based approach, this identified set
of genes was not constricted to the pre-carved pathway consensus.

PhenoNet

 

This way, we discovered previously untagged interactions that are the
core mechanism of the disease. Finally, we compared the obtained results
with the results obtained through the pathway-based approach. The most
signiﬁcant result is tagged as the most effective biomarker.

2.4 Sample data for case study

Sample data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database, available at http://cancergenome.nih.gov/. The dataset com-
bined from RNA-sequencing data and clinical characteristics of 244
breast cancer patients. RNA-sequencing data were aligned to the
human reference genome build th9 using TopHat (Trapnell et al.,
2009) and analyzed using Cufﬁinks (Trapnell et al., 2010) to produce
FPKM values. The TCGA dataset was analyzed by PhenoNet, thus
identifying the network that signiﬁcantly stratiﬁes triple-negative (TN)
patients from non-triple-negative (non-TN) patients.

2.5 Sample data for validation analysis

As TCGA is the only dataset that contains a large-enough collection of
RNA-sequencing with its paired clinical data of breast cancer patients, we
used, as validation to the robustness of the method, two additional micro-
array breast cancer datasets. Using PhenoNet, we stratiﬁed these data
according to their luminal A and luminal B subtypes (the datasets con-
taining TN data were too small for this type of analysis).

The two additional datasets obtained from GEO are: GSE20713
(Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011) and GSE21653 (Sabatier et al., 2011a, b).
The datasets are composed of gene expression and clinical information
from breast cancer patients. Luminal A and luminal B subtypes were
extracted and used in this analysis owing to the shortage of TN
information.

2.6 False discovery rate analysis

The analysis of large datasets has become mainstream. It is often the case
that thousands of features in a genome-wide dataset are tested again st the
null hypothesis, and only a fraction of those features are expected to be
signiﬁcant. An overwhelming number of measurements require correc-
tions for multiple hypotheses. We used Benjamini and Hochberg’s false
discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We performed
FDR analysis to determine the FDR for the network identiﬁed by
PhenoNet and for individual edges in the network. The index we propose
here quantiﬁes the strength of the subnetwork found based on the differ-
ences between the two phenotypes. We term this index the edge correl-
ation distance (ECD). ECD is measured as detailed in Equation (1):

p ,- A = pearson JorrelationfonphenotypeA

pi], = pearsonJorrelationfonphenotypeB
Apr = piA — pm
(0 — Ap,—)2 = Squaredjistancefromjero

7' n

n = numbenoﬂedges

Ap_i indicates the delta over Pearson correlation coefficients between
the two edges. This index forms a new distribution based on the differ-
ences between the two phenotypes, and calculates the distribution dis-
tance from zero that, in this case, represents a lack of difference in
correlation. N represents the number of edges in the subnetwork.
Overall, ECD metrics calculates, for every two edges, the squared dis-
tance of those edges from zero. ECD can range from zero to two (zero
indicates no difference and two represents the biggest change possible, the
difference between correlation of 1 in one group and a correlation of -1 in
the other). By randomly constructing a large number of networks (we
chose 10 000 in this simulation), we are able to calculate the ECD index
for every random network, and to estimate the probability of obtaining
the observed ECD in the networks found by PhenoNet, as calculated for
the two datasets, by chance. The ECD for the ﬁrst dataset (GSE20713)
was found to be 0.96, with a P-value of 0, and the ECD for the second
dataset (GSE21653) was 0.89, with a P-value of 3.21e-08.

The described FDR algorithm iteratively randomized phenotypic af-
ﬁliation within patients 10000 times, thus mimicking the results of a
random, non-disease state. The results revealed that all edges were sig-
niﬁcant, as can be seen in Figure 2, meaning that the network found by
PhenoNet is statistically highly signiﬁcant and can only be accounted for
through a disease-introduced mechanism.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Case study: PhenoNet algorithm identiﬁes core
mechanisms in TN breast cancer samples

TN breast cancer is of great interest in oncology research. TN
cancers do not respond to hormonal therapies or to treatments
targeted against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 re-
ceptors. The only systemic therapy currently available is chemo-
therapy, and prognosis remains poor (Stockmans et al., 2008).
TNs are tumors without the observable expression of estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and HER2neu.

Here, using RNA-seq data from 244 breast cancer patients
from the TCGA, we performed phenotype classiﬁcation using
PhenoNet algorithm. The two phenotypes chosen were a TN

Randomized ECD

Fig. 2. False discovery analysis. The graph represents the ECD
values calculated from 10000 randomized iterations. By randomizing
the clinical data, we were able to mimic a non-disease-related state.
The results presented here show the randomized distribution, as
opposed to the real disease state, in the two breast cancer datasets
tested, which implies that the sub-networks found by PhenoNet are dis-
ease speciﬁc

group that included 52 patients, and a non-TN group that
included 192 patients.

RNA-seq FPKM levels (Section 2), along with phenotypic
groups, were provided as input. PhenoNet then iterated across
all 464 pathways in the database, to identify the most variable
pathway between the TN and the non-TN groups. Once pathway
metrics for the entire collection of pathways were established, we
chose the single most significant pathway according to its calcu-
lated P-value and its phenotype delta (see Section 2).

As previously discussed, the PPI network embedded within
PhenoNet is composed of 10489 genes and 62 643 interactions.
As the lower threshold is set using the pathway approach
described above, PhenoNet, using a greedy search methodology,
iterates across the complete interaction matrix to identify inter-
acting genes that create an optimal subnetwork (with the pre-
requisite of outperforming the previously selected single
pathway). Once all iterations are exhausted, PhenoNet returns
the best solution for the phenotype stratification. Figure 3 shows
PhenoNet results for the network modules that stratify TN and
non-TN groups in the analyzed breast cancer dataset. PhenoNet
identiﬁed the network shown in Figure 3 as a highly modiﬁed
version of the same mechanism in the two phenotype groups,
with a highly signiﬁcant P-value of 1.2e-009. Figure 3 shows us
that the TN group is highly correlated; the colors of edges rep-
resent the correlation coefﬁcients [low (red) to high (green) over a
gradient], which indicate hypothesized regulation strength be-
tween the interacting genes. In contrast, the non-TN group pro-
duces low, practically zero, correlation values, indicating a
possible loss of regulation within the participating genes.

The results presented here suggest this subnetwork as a can-
didate molecular mechanism involved in the control of TN breast
cancer. When such control fails (and the correlation between the
genes disappears), we see the network that characterizes the non-
TN cases, which are more treatable and associated with better
prognosis. Network-aware intervention may, therefore, seek to
adjust the TN network to its non-TN behavior and, conse-
quently, to control clinical presentation.

3.2 Validation

Over the past few years, robustness proved to be highly import-
ant feature in molecular signatures (Ben-Hamo and Efroni,
2012a,b; Ben-Hamo and Efroni, 2013; Ein-Dor et al., 2006;
Venet et al., 2011). Identiﬁed signatures are strengthened
through multiple validations in additional, independent datasets.
Ideally, to validate the algorithm, we would require re-applica-
tion of the same approach of analysis on additional RNA-seq
datasets produced from tumor samples taken from patients iden-
tiﬁed as having TN or non-TN breast cancer. Unfortunately,
TCGA is the only available dataset with information of a sig-
niﬁcant number of patients. To overcome this limitation, we
validated PhenoNet using two independent breast cancer micro-
array datasets with enough clinical information about patients’
luminal A and luminal B status. As PhenoNet is impartial to the
speciﬁc method used for transcriptome quantiﬁcation (micro-
array, RNA-seq), the analysis of these two unrelated breast can-
cer datasets, GSE20713 (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011) and
GSE21653 (Sabatier et al., 2011b), that combine gene expression
and clinical data, will identify subnetworks that signiﬁcantly
stratify the subtypes. Figure 4 shows PhenoNet results in the
two datasets tested based on the luminal A and B classiﬁcation.

Although the identiﬁed networks are not identical, they share
key control genes and four overlapping edges. These overlapping
edges provide robustness and highlight a possible role for this
subnetwork in its involvement with the luminal A/B phenotypes.
Figure 5 highlights differences in these phenotypes.

The networks identiﬁed using PhenoNet call special attention
to YWHAG as a key regulator of the division between subtypes.
YWHAG (also known as 14-3-3 y) is part of the 14-3-3 protein
family that participates in phosphorylation-dependent PPIs that
control progression through the cell cycle, initiation and main-
tenance of DNA-damage checkpoints, activation of MAP kin-
ases, prevention of apoptosis and coordination of integrin

signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics (Wilker and Yaffe, 2004).
This family plays an important role in cancer. Song et a].
(2012) recently found that the expression levels of the
YWHAG protein in breast cancer were significantly higher
than in non-cancerous mammary-gland tissues. Furthermore,
they found a correlation between the expression levels of this
protein and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of
breast cancer patients.

Although this single gene, YWHAG, has been brought for-
ward through this and previous research, it is important to em-
phasize that none of the genes in these subnetworks, by
themselves, shows any stratiﬁcation strength in separating the
two subtypes, as can be seen in Supplementary Table S1;
i.e. the gene components of the network, when taken separately
and out of the network context of the other genes in the path-
way, failed to provide biomedical meaning (Supplementary
Table S1).

4 DISCUSSION

Cancer is not a static disease; disease progression correlates with
molecular modiﬁcations to evade natural defenses and to adapt
to new environmental and micro-environmental circumstances.
Such drastic changes that stands at the core of the cancer pheno-
type are not isolated incidents but are systemic modiﬁcations;
indeed, the initiation and progression of the disease are driven
by a large set of factors such as: interactions among genes, pro-
teins and the environment, rather than by single alterations in
genetic variants (Correia and Bissell, 2012; Ziogas et al., 2011).
Systemic approaches enable the integration of biological
and computational knowledge, and help address fundamental
questions regarding the complexity and connectivity of this
system-wide rewiring. Different molecular phenotypes are the
manifestations of different molecular characteristics within the
same, single disease. Such complex proﬁles of molecular pheno-
types are determined using molecular and genetic information
from tumor cells. Oncogenesis may be better considered not
only as the rearrangement of chromosomes but also as the re-
arrangement of regulatory networks, their interactions and their
interconnections. Cancer is not a disease of a few genes but of a
cluster of genes, whose altered global interactions evolve into
the transformed and malignant state. These considerations, as
well as their multilayered association with network features,
call for a network behavior tool with the ability to identify
core network alterations that are at the root of phenotypic
changes.

Here, we describe PhenoNet, a novel algorithm for the iden-
tiﬁcation of subnetworks of genes or known pathways whose
molecular co-behavior stratiﬁes phenotypes. Correlations be-
tween the expression levels of interacting genes indicate regula-
tory control between network nodes. We search for subnetworks
whose synchronization is visible in one phenotype and contrasted
by another. Thus, when we identify a highly correlated subnet-
work in one group of patients and then identify the loss of this
correlation in another, the assumption is that this regulation is
fragmented during the course of progression into or out of the
phenotype. PhenoNet is able to identify such networks. Gelenbe
(2007) wrote that ‘a regulatory network acts as the control
system of a biochemical nanofactory with the rate of production
of certain compounds being determined by the probability that
certain sets of agents are activated’. The approach presented here
uses the known regulatory PPI network to extract a subnetwork
that acts as a control system distinguishing between the two
phenotypes.

To determine PhenoNet robustness we compared it with a
set of highly informative and well-structured tools: SurvNet
(Li et al., 2012), Biolayout Express (Theocharidis et al., 2009)
and C3NET (Altay and Emmert—Streib, 2011). For this analysis,
we used the two breast cancer datasets that were tested (see
above) on PhenoNet. PhenoNet results demonstrated a 50%
overlap between the networks discovered for the two breast can-
cer datasets. This robustness was not repeated in the three tested
tools. As informative and useful as these tools are, and without
speciﬁc criticism of the important results that can be obtained
using them, they did not repeat the results obtained from the two
datasets (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2; Supplementary
Tables S27S5). This highlights a unique and important feature

of PhenoNet, i.e. robustness, which is a necessity in transcrip-
tomics-based biomarker discovery.

We first applied PhenoNet to stratify network rewiring in
breast cancer clinical subgroups: TN (ER-, PgR-, Her2-) and
the non-TN. Using breast cancer RNA-seq data from the
TCGA, the network identiﬁed by PhenoNet as the most signifi-
cant in distinguishing between those two groups, was dominated
by T-gene (also known as Brachyury), as can be seen in Figure 3.
The T-box family of genes is a group of highly conserved tran-
scription factors (TF) that play an important role in embryonic
development (Fan et al., 2004). It has been found that the T-box
TF Brachyury induces in tumor cells epithelial-mesenchymal
markers, down regulation of epithelial markers and an increase
in cell migration and invasion. Inhibition of Brachyury resulted
in loss of cell migration and invasion, and reduced the ability of
human tumor cells to form lung metastasis (Fernando et al.,
2010; Roselli et al., 2012). These findings may support some of
the results shown in this article. Although the subnetwork iden-
tified in the TN group is highly correlated, this same subnetwork
is uncorrelated in the non-TN group. This network may be the
cause of the high level of aggressiveness of the TN tumors. As
long as this network is controlled by T-gene migration, invasion
and metastasis are promoted. Once this control mechanism is
lost (and with it the subnetwork correlation), the breast cancer
phenotype becomes less aggressive and is manifested as non-TN.

The use of two additional breast cancer datasets to validate
our approach using samples from tumors with receptor status
[ER+, PgR+, and Her2— (classiﬁed as luminal A), and ER+,
PgR+, and Her2+ (classiﬁed as luminal B)], demonstrated
how PhenoNet directs the identiﬁcation of a key player in the
stratiﬁcation of the subnetworks in both datasets, namely
YWHAG. YWHAG belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins
that regulate many cellular processes that are important in
cancer biology, such as apoptosis and cell cycle check points
(Hermeking, 2003). A recent study showed an association be-
tween single nucleotide polymorphisms in YWHAG and breast
cancer subtype ER+ and Her2- (P—value<0.05) (Olson et al.,
2011). In addition, YWHAG was also found to be correlated
with the expression pattern of ER protein in breast cancer in a
way that correlated with patient outcome (Jenssen et al., 2002).
Taken together, this may suggest an important role played by
YWHAG in controlling the networks and in stratifying the two
subtypes.

The article presented here provides means to identify core
processes that are tightly linked with different phenotypic mani-
festations of disease. We believe that network target identiﬁca-
tion is the key for constructing drug-target networks and for
improving the understanding of disease etiology.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled through molecu-
lar logic circuits that combine regulatory signals of many different fac-
tors. In particular, complexation of transcription factors (T Fs) and other
regulatory proteins is a prevailing and highly conserved mechanism of
signal integration within critical regulatory pathways and enables us to
infer controlled genes as well as the exerted regulatory mechanism.
Common approaches for protein complex prediction that only use
protein interaction networks, however, are designed to detect self-
contained functional complexes and have difficulties to reveal dynamic
combinatorial assemblies of physically interacting proteins.

Results: We developed the novel algorithm DACO that combines pro-
tein—protein interaction networks and domain—domain interaction net-
works with the cluster-quality metric cohesiveness. The metric is
locally maximized on the holistic level of protein interactions, and con-
nectivity constraints on the domain level are used to account for the
exclusive and thus inherently combinatorial nature of the interactions
within such assemblies. When applied to predicting TF complexes in
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proposed approach outper-
formed popular complex prediction methods by far. Furthermore, we
were able to assign many of the predictions to target genes, as well as
to a potential regulatory effect in agreement with literature evidence.

1 INTRODUCTION

The complexity of higher eukaryotes cannot be explained with-
out considering the combinatorial regulation of transcription
(Levine and Tjian, 2003). Recent experimental work showed
that the information encoded by many regulatory control elem-
ents, namely speciﬁc DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs)
and their cofactors, epigenetic marks, microRNAs and other
input signals, is integrated to orchestrate the expression patterns
of genes in a context-dependent manner in time and space (Spitz
and Furlong, 2012).

On a conceptual level, this complex signal processing task is
accomplished by an interplay of several control layers. Cis-regu—
latory modules, functional sequence segments whose accessibility
is dependent on the packing state of the chromatin, enable basic
logic operations on the input that are essentially implemented by
proteiniprotein interactions between DNA-binding proteins
with suitably positioned binding sites (Buchler et al., 2003;
Istrail and Davidson, 2005). When bound to the DNA, these
proteins often mediate further physical interactions that provide
an additional scaffold besides the regulatory sequence. This

important aspect expands the current understanding of cis-regu—
latory signal integration beyond the linear sequence-based code
(Junion et al., 2012; Siggers and Gordan, 2014). The scaffold is
used to recruit additional TFs or cofactors that entail regulatory
capabilities such as epigenetic alterations or mediate interactions
with other TFs on selected sites where binding motifs obey cer-
tain distance constraints (Diez et al., 2014; Goke et al., 2011).

TFs that participate in such multi—protein complexes to pro-
duce decisive output signals are referred to as being ‘cooperative’
(Aguilar and Oliva, 2008; Spitz and Furlong, 2012). Cooperative
TFs are found in shorter distance and are more clustered within
the protein interaction network than expected by chance (Aguilar
and Oliva, 2008; Manke et al., 2003). Although they inﬂuence
similar groups of target genes, what supports their role as im-
portant regulatory drivers, they neither seem to share similar
regulatory inputs nor regulate each other (Aguilar and Oliva,
2008). Recent research showed that cooperative binding events
are evolutionary much stronger conserved (Goke et al., 2011; He
et al., 2011; Kazemian et al., 2013) and show a greater impact on
expression compared with individual binding events (Hemberg
and Kreiman, 2011). Furthermore, they turned out to be driving
regulators in essential eukaryotic control processes such as the
cell cycle in yeast (Simon et al., 2001), body part formation in
Drosophila (He et al., 2011; Kazemian et al., 2013) or mamma-
lian cell fate determination (Goke et al., 2011; Hochedlinger and
Plath, 2009; Wilson et al., 2010). The understanding of this com-
binatorial interplay requires a paradigm shift from single key
players to the coupled activity of many regulatory control
elements.

At a ﬁrst glance, the prediction of protein complexes is a well-
established field. Data for physical interactions between proteins
in the form of proteiniprotein interaction networks (PPIN) is
abundant and so are suitable clustering approaches that ﬁnd
dense areas in networks. A very successful recent method is
ClusterONE (Nepusz et al., 2012), which locally optimizes the
cluster quality measure cohesiveness. This is done iteratively by
stepwise addition/removal of the locally most valuable incident/
boundary proteins. The cohesiveness f of a set of proteins Vin a
network is generally defined as

Win ( V)
Win ( V) + Wbound( V)

where wi”(V) denotes the total weight of edges between members
of V (internal edges), and whomd(V) denotes the total weight of
edges that connect V with the rest of the network (boundary
edges). Figure 1 illustrates these deﬁnitions with an example
and additionally introduces the notion of incident and bound-
ary proteins. Cohesiveness assesses the structural properties of
subnetworks that we aim for in this work: they should be
densely connected but at the same time well separated from the
outside.

An important feature of ClusterONE and other successful
complex prediction approaches is to account for overlaps be-
tween complexes. Many protein complexes are organized in a
modular and combinatorial fashion so that proteins may take
part in several distinct complexes (Han et al., 2004; Jung et al.,
2010; Kim et al., 2006). PPINs provide a static compilation of
assumed pairwise interactions, whereas real biological inter-
actions are highly dynamic and intrinsically controlled by protein
expression and spatial constraints. To enable the formation of a
physically interacting protein complex, all involved proteins must
be expressed at the same time (Han et al., 2004; Jansen et al.,
2002) and must be capable of forming a stable binding topology
devoid of any binding site competition (Keskin and Nussinov,
2007; Kim et al., 2006). The integration of additional data should
thus allow us to derive a clearer picture of the combinatorial
complexity of protein complexes.

Although the combinatorial manifold of individual proteins
was studied before (Tuncbag et al., 2009; Tyagi et al., 2009),
few computational methods so far account for those effects. A
ﬁrst step in this direction was taken by Jung et al. (2010) who
annotated mutually exclusive interactions in a yeast protein net-
work using structural data, where available, to determine all pos-
sible conﬂict-free subnetworks. Owing to the exponential
complexity, the construction was limited to previously deter-
mined dense areas of the network that were then used to predict
complexes. The evaluation showed that the effort can lead to a
considerable reﬁnement of a given pre-clustering by the conse-
quent exclusion of superﬂuous proteins from complex candi-
dates. To our knowledge, this is the only available method that
accounts for the combinatorial possibilities due to binding inter-
face limitations.

Due to the current sparsity of available structural data on the
3D conformations of proteiniprotein complexes, a model based
on domainwlomain interactions (DDIs) as introduced by Ozawa
et a]. (2010) appeared to us as a worthwhile alternative. Given a
dense protein interaction subnetwork from a generic complex
prediction approach, one decomposes the member proteins
into their domains and bases the connectivity on interactions
between the individual domains, the DDIs. This transformation
to a domain-level network can then be used to filter out false-
positive predictions. If every domain is restricted to participate in

 

Fig. 1. For convenience, all edges in the PPIN have unit weight and the
corresponding weight annotation is omitted. The current members of the
cohesive subset V: {C , D, E} and their internal edges are colored green,
boundary edges are marked red. Boundary edges can be thought to span
a boundary (shown as a dashed line) that separates the current dense
subset V from the remaining network. This border deﬁnes the set of
incident proteins Vim. = {3, F}, external vertices adjacent to the boundary,
and boundary proteins med = {D, E}, internal vertices at the boundary.

only one interaction, the model implies a certain binding inter-
face constraint and thus reveals which proteins can be connected
at the same time. This is important because true protein com-
plexes must admit a topology of pairwise binding at the level of
interfaces, and these interfaces are often exclusive (Aloy and
Russell, 2006; Kim et al., 2006). The model assumes that the
correct topology has the maximal number of simultaneous inter-
actions. Ma et a]. (2012) enhanced the initial model by introdu-
cing a sequence-based domain prediction step and artiﬁcial
domains that help to maintain connectivity due to incomplete
annotation. Furthermore, they suggested a polynomial time so-
lution. Deploying the DDI model as a filtering step to existing
clustering approaches was shown to increase the precision of
predictions. However, the methods by Ozawa and Ma only pro-
vide a fixed solution for each complex candidate. If one is inter-
ested in the combinatorial manifold of potential solutions, one
would have to enumerate all possible exclusive choices in ad-
vance. This is the gap we want to ﬁll with our algorithm.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

We developed a novel combinatorial approach that combines the local
optimization of cohesiveness based on weighted protein interaction data
and the competition of binding interfaces by adapted integration of
domain interaction data. We consequently termed the method ‘domain-
aware cohesiveness optimization’ or ‘DACO’. The integration of different
levels of granularity coupled with the set of rules introduced by the DDI
model is used to enforce a loop invariant within the iterative algorithm
that ensures a conﬂict-free domain interaction topology within the cur-
rently grown dense subset during the execution. Hence, a selection of
densely connected proteins is always accompanied with a valid spanning
tree on the domain level.

A prototype of the approach was implemented in Python (Fig. 2). The
only data sources needed as input are a probability-weighted PPIN in the
SIF format (simple interaction format, interaction partners and weight
are supplied linewise) with nodes named by their UniProt IDs (The
UniProt Consortium, 2014), a list of proteins that are used to seed the
growth, a threshold to generate the seed pairs, and an upper bound for

the depth of search to keep the combinatorial explosion on a local level.
Given those requirements, the tool automatically retrieves all the data
that it needs to build the DDIN and executes the proposed DACO. The
program queries Pfam (Punta et al., 2012) and InterPro (Hunter et al.,
2012) for the domain annotation and IDDI (Kim et al., 2012) and
DOMINE (Yellaboina et al., 2011) as the data sources for domain inter-
actions. Furthermore, UniProt annotations and the ‘dbfetch’ Web service
at EMBL-EBI (Lopez et al., 2003) are used for name conversion tasks.
The implementation is completely independent of the organism and can
directly be applied to any other desired organism if the required input
data are provided. Details are given in the Supplementary Materials
(Section 1.3).

2.1 Domain-aware cohesiveness optimization

Figure 3 illustrates the deﬁnitions for incident and boundary proteins on
the domain level. Given a certain execution state of the algorithm, deﬁned
as the set of currently selected proteins in the assumed cluster V and the
active domain interactions between them, the first step is to determine
incident and boundary proteins. Connectivity issues are considered ac-
cording to the domain occupancy of the DDIN using the constraints of
the DDI model. With the introduction of this abstraction, binding site
conﬂicts as deﬁned by the model are precluded right from the start to
retain the self-imposed loop invariant.

In the next step, we check for all incident proteins whether the cohe-
siveness can be increased when adding them to V. The same test is applied
for removing all boundary proteins. This computation is solely performed
on the level of the weighted protein interactions and is independent of the
current domain occupancy in the sense that all interactions are taken into
account. Although individual edge weights may be unreliable, deviations
will average out when many weighted interactions are combined (Nepusz
et al., 2012). Among all possible modiﬁcations V we select the one that
maximizes the cohesiveness. Every iteration can have three outcomes: the
algorithm could terminate because no further increase is possible, the
removal of a protein could yield the largest gain or the addition of a
protein may be the optimal choice. In the ﬁrst case, the current complex
candidate set V is returned and the algorithm terminates, as the cohesive-
ness is locally optimal. The removal case changes the current state. The
boundary protein P is removed from V leading to V’ = V\{P}.
Additionally, the domains occupied by the distinct spanning edge that
connected P to the remaining cluster V’ are made available again. The
deﬁnition of boundary proteins ensures the preservation of connectivity
within domains of V’. The next iteration is then computed using this
modiﬁed state.

Adding a protein P is more difﬁcult. Certainly, V is modiﬁed to

/_

7 V U {P} and P needs to establish a domain interaction with a protein

 

Fig. 3. The green nodes in this DDIN are the proteins currently included
in V: {A, C, E} and the green edges show how the current dense cluster is
connected on the domain level. Incident nodes Vim: {3, D} are those
nodes that can be connected to V by a new domain-interaction edge
(colored in red) to an unused domain of an internal protein (blue do-
mains). Boundary nodes hound: {A, E} are proteins in V with only one
used domain. A later removal of an internal node with two or more
occupied domains would inevitably lead to a breakdown of the spanning
tree on the domain level and thus introduce inconsistencies during
execution

within V. But often several interactions are able to link P to V on the
domain level. This choice can be crucial for further expansions because it
may lead to differing occupancies on the domain level and therefore
changes the moves that will be possible in later steps. To take this into
account, the algorithm branches and evaluates the outcome of every pos-
sible spanning edge on the domain level. The DDIN does not provide a
qualitative rating for its individual edges, and all choices lead to the same
increase in cohesiveness. However, a reasonable consideration is to ex-
ploit the weight annotation of the protein interaction network.
Associating each domain interaction with the probability of the corres-
ponding edge between the connected proteins in the PPIN establishes an
overall probability that can be used as an early pruning criterion. This
correspondence will likely represent an upper limit achievable by any of
the domain interactions between the proteins (or even a combination of
several) and thus provides a conservative estimate. When assuming that
spanning edges in the DDIN are independent of each other, the prob-
ability to observe an underlying spanning tree on the domain level is the
product of the probabilities of all its spanning edges. If, at a particular
iteration of the algorithm, a resulting cohesiveness-maximizing candidate
would yield a value <0.S, the current cluster is returned instead. In the
case of an addition, all alternatives below the threshold are withdrawn
early and the current cluster is only returned if no alternative choice
shows a total probability within the boundary. Further information
and pseudocode is provided in the Supplementary Materials (Section 1.
1 / 1.2).

Local cohesiveness optimization in ClusterONE starts its greedy
growth process from single proteins in the network. Like every greedy
algorithm, it is prone to local extrema. In our case, this is desirable be-
cause we want to grasp the local combinatorial manifold of complexes
around TFs and, owing to the implemented branching principle, the al-
gorithm is able to diversify its intermediate states with a variety of justi-
ﬁed directionalities induced by the previous history of domain choices.
However, each time the complex candidate is enlarged, only one protein
is selected for expansion to keep the runtime convenient. This is especially
critical and error-prone during the very ﬁrst expansion step when only
one internal edge and the boundary edges of the two proteins taken from
inherently noisy network data (von Mering et al., 2002) are taken into
account (Supplementary Fig. S2). Considering this, we decided to start
the growth process from pre-built pairs of proteins to spice up the opti-
mization. This overcomes any unfounded directional bias early on in the
ﬁrst expansion step and paves the way for the reasoned bias owing to
domain constraints. Furthermore, the pairings should be determined on
the basis of the probability of a protein interaction between the two
proteins up to a certain likelihood if such data are available. While co-
hesiveness is undoubtedly a powerful measure of cluster quality if several
proteins are involved, its included notion of seclusiveness only has a
limited validity for pairs. It is especially misleading for proteins that are
combinatorically active and thus potentially exhibit higher boundary
weights within the cohesiveness calculations, putting them at a disadvan-
tage compared with less promiscuous nodes in the network.

2.2 Setup for yeast computations

We compared our DACO approach to the most recent versions of the
popular complex prediction tools MCODE (Bader and Hogue, 2003),
MCL (Enright et al., 2002) and ClusterONE (Nepusz et al., 2012)
using common benchmarks for protein complex prediction in yeast and
the weighted high-quality yeast protein interaction network PrePPI
(Zhang et al., 2013).

Figure 2 illustrates the workﬂow of the DACO algorithm. Given the
PrePPI network and 148 TFs as annotated in the Yeast Promoter Atlas
(YPA) (Chang et al., 2011), the complete DDIN was built and all seed
pairs were selected that exceed a probability of t = 0.75 according to
PrePPI (or at least two partners if no interaction was within the thresh-
old). Two TFs annotated in the YPA, MATAl and MAL63 are not

represented in the PrePPI-PPIN and were therefore omitted. The thus
generated start seed comprised 1526 distinct protein pairs that form 1898
start states considering the choices of the necessary domain interaction
between each pair. The runs were then executed with a depth threshold of
d = 10, i.e. the DACO algorithm considered complexes containing up to
10 proteins. The parameter choice of t and d is discussed in the
Supplementary Materials (Section 2.1).

MCODE (MCD) was used as a Cytoscape3 plug-in (Saito et al., 2012)
in version 1.4b2. For MCL, the stand-alone binary in version 12-068 was
used. ClusterONE results were generated with the stand-alone implemen-
tation in version 1.0. ClusterONE allows the user to manually inﬂuence
seed node or sets of seed nodes. In the unsupervised mode (termed C11
here), the implementation takes care of the initialization. Additionally,
two different case-speciﬁc seeded variants were set manually. In the ﬁrst
case, all YPA-annotated TFs were set as initial start proteins (Clls). In
the second case, all pairs used to initialize DACO were also taken to
commence ClusterONE (Cllps) to assess the beneﬁt of an induced com-
binatorial ﬂavor. To restrict the results to TF complexes, the output of
MCODE, MCL and ClusterONE was ﬁltered for predicted candidates
that contained at least one TF annotated in the YPA. Because the com-
pared general approaches allow tuning of individual parameters, opti-
mization of the most inﬂuential settings was conducted to obtain the
most competitive individual and overall parameter sets for every single
score. As the best overall parameter set, we used the one with the largest
sum of averaged reference and biological scores (Supplementary
Materials Section 2.2).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 1 lists the quantities of predicted TF-containing complexes
and distinct combinations of TFs that are predicted by the indi-
vidual methods. Our new DACO algorithm suggested 8785 times
more TF complex candidates than any of the established meth-
ods. As expected, the ClusterONE run initialized with the pre-
built pairs returned the second most TF complexes and variants.
MCODE detected the smallest number of complexes. Also, the
MCODE output size deviated the most between overall best and
individual best parameter set. The differences between the start
variants for ClusterONE (that also locally optimizes the cohe-
siveness but does not use the domain model) were surprising:
when initialized with the individual TFs as seeds, fewer com-
plexes were predicted than when starting the growth from hub
proteins in the PPIN, irrespective of the type of the hub proteins.
Likewise worth mentioning is the comparably small number of
candidates suggested when starting from the 1526 pre—built pairs
in comparison with the domain-aware approach. Although
initiated with seeds that should favor the combinatorial

manifold, the number of predicted TF variants was below the
number of annotated TFs (148). This suggests that an approach
that only uses protein interaction data is not sufﬁcient to grasp
the biological borders of such highly modular subnetworks that
fulﬁll binding-interface constraints.

3.1 Common complex prediction benchmarks

We computed established measures for the quality of complex
predictions based on the agreement with reference datasets.
Precision, recall and F-score (Li et al., 2010) were calculated
on the basis of the overlap score (Bader and Hogue, 2003).
Furthermore, we computed the geometric accuracy (Brohée
and van Helden, 2006) and the maximum matching ratio
(Nepusz et al., 2012). All measures were independently evaluated
on three different protein complex reference datasets for yeast,
namely CYC2008 (Pu et al., 2009), MIPS (Mewes et al., 2006)
and the SGD (Cherry et al., 2012). With the exception of the
precision, all quality metrics were calculated in compliance with
the corresponding reference complex sets ﬁltered to the subset of
known complexes that involve at least one annotated TF. The
precision calculation was allowed to match a candidate to a ref-
erence complex that does not include a TF. This was done to
facilitate matches that potentially recruited larger complexes of
regulatory function in yeast, such as SWI/SNF or RSC. In this
context, a method that predicts a candidate with high overlap to
such a complex and contains at least one TF should not be
placed at a disadvantage. The threshold of tests based on the
overlap score was set to a)(A, B) >0.25.

Figure 4 shows the results of all benchmarks for the overall
best parameter set of the compared methods. The overall quali-
tative picture is neither affected if the best parameter set per
measure is considered (Supplementary Table S9) nor by the

relaxed deﬁnition of the precision (Supplementary Table S11).
Except for the geometric accuracy on the MIPS dataset, our
novel DACO approach designed for the combinatorial task of
predicting TF complexes outperformed the established general
algorithms in the agreement with reference complexes. Owing to
its local enumeration and thus smaller predicted complexes,
DACO is put at a technical disadvantage toward the relatively
large TF complexes in MIPS though (Supplementary Table S12).
Surprisingly, ClusterONE when started from the curated pairs
was on average not superior to the completely unsupervised ver-
sion. Even the recall was only slightly better for one dataset,
whereas the precision was strictly lower. Only in the maximum
matching ratio, owing to its missing penalization of non-match-
ing predictions, it performed slightly better. This shows that
growing from pairs does not beneﬁt the local cohesiveness opti-
mization as implemented by ClusterONE. This can again be
attributed to the missing information of physical constraints in
protein interaction networks leading to the fusion of highly
modular dense subnetworks (Supplementary Fig. S3). The add-
itional incorporation of the domain topology in the fashion of
Ma et a]. (2012) can be beneﬁcial but leads to an even smaller
ensemble of solutions (Supplementary Tables S10 and 11).

Next, we tested the biological plausibility of the results on the
basis of colocalization and functional homogeneity within com-
plexes. In the special case of TF complexes, one should expect an
in vivo localization to the nucleus for all proteins within the same
complex. The nucleus colocalization score is deﬁned as the aver-
age fraction of proteins per complex encountered in the nucleus
weighted by the size of the complex (Friedel et al., 2009).
Localization data were taken from Huh et a]. (2003).
Homogeneity was tested as the fraction of complex candidates
with at least one enriched Gene Ontology annotation (Ashburner
et al., 2000) at signiﬁcance level P = 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected)
(Zhang et al., 2008).

Our novel method also performed well in the assessments of
biological relevance. While MCODE delivered the best-scoring
candidates with respect to enrichment, on average less than half
of the proteins among the TF complexes predicted by MCODE
are found in the nucleus. MCL was not able to achieve >43%
nucleus colocalization with any setting. For the particular task of
TF complex prediction, the nucleus colocalization score should
be clearly seen as the most important one among the measures of
biological relevance. Hence, the DACO approach also clearly
succeeds in this aspect.

3.2 Regulatory role of TF complexes

In the next step, we determined the target genes of all involved
TFs from the binding data provided by the YPA. In total, 79%
of the 412 distinct TF sets that belong to complexes predicted by
DACO shared common target genes, which is above mere chance
for every n-tuple of TFs (Supplementary Fig. S4). This informa-
tion could be used to build a gene regulatory network that in-
cludes potentially meaningful cooperative TFs. However, even
more powerful predictions are feasible based on the DACO re-
sults because recruited regulatory proteins were predicted as well.

As an example for such an analysis, we have tried to charac-
terize the different modes of action by which TF complexes may
affect transcription. In general, TFs or regulatory proteins

recruited by TFs either interact with the basal machinery or
affect the chromatin structure and histone placement. Yeast
only contains few proteins for histone acetylation and for the
speciﬁc methylation of H3K4,36,79, whereas all modiﬁcations
are basically associated with increased accessibility and therefore
transcriptional upregulation (Millar and Grunstein, 2006). Few
exceptions to this are known so far 0(in et al., 2007). On the
basis of this yeast-speciﬁc simpliﬁcation, we compiled proteins
associated with the following list of GO terms, namely direct
contribution to a positive or negative transcriptional regulation
(GO:0045944/GO:0000122), cofactor-mediated (GO:0003713/
GO:0003714), and epigenetic contributions (GO:0004402,
GO:0042054/GO:0004407, GO:0032452). Further, we deter-
mined chromatin remodeling proteins (GO:0006338) and pro-
teins that belong to the basal machinery (GO:0016591). Single
proteins that were annotated with both positive and negative
inﬂuence in different contexts were excluded to prevent ambigu-
ity (Supplementary Table S13).

Then, all protein assemblies predicted by DACO across all TF
variants were checked for contradictory statements, e. g. whether
they harbored proteins that are marked to positively inﬂuence
transcription as well as proteins that are annotated with repres-
sory function. Only 17% of the predicted complexes comprised
conﬂicting proteins. Among the consistent candidates, 79% had
at least one of the annotation as considered, and for 65% even the
direction of the contribution to the regulation could be inferred.
Interestingly, 3% of the TF combinations took part in assemblies
with opposing regulatory effects. For example, the TF pair RFXl /
REBl occurred in 10 predicted candidates. Four of those were
annotated with activating proteins, for two complexes repressory
function was deduced and eight involved chromatin remodeling.
All candidates were devoid of contradictory annotations. RFXl is
known to change its function by recruitment of the CYC8/TUP1
corepressor complex (Zhang and Reese, 2005). Both corepressor
proteins were found in the predicted repressive candidates and
were the decisive factors for the corresponding classiﬁcation.
Furthermore, REBl is associated with nucleosome-depleted re-
gions, supporting the recruitment of remodelers (Bai et al., 2011).

While this simple categorization strategy seems to work well
for yeast where it provided further mechanistic insights on such
complexes, it will likely not be adequate for higher eukaryotes.
Still, the potential information on the mode of action carried out
by the recruited proteins is a huge beneﬁt in comparison with the
common information that is retrieved from the functions of TFs
and target genes in gene regulatory networks. Future computa-
tional models of transcription may also consider the histone
code, so that possible modiﬁcations could be inferred with an
equivalent level of detail from recruited writer proteins.

3.3 Analysis of target gene coexpression

The complete set of predicted complex candidates provides a super-
ordinate overview of putative regulatory players. To ﬁnd causal
links between TF tuples and their regulatory targets, we incorpo-
rated expression data and applied a strict association method.
Based on the idea that genes that are regulated by the same control
mechanism should exhibit a highly similar expression pattern in a
certain condition, individual assemblies can be assigned to cellular
states (Pilpel et al., 2001; Wang and Zhang, 2006).

For all predicted pairs and higher-order tuples of TFs (290 in
total), we analyzed the coexpression of their target genes within a
time series of 32 timepoints for the yeast cell cycle by Chin et a].
(2012). The aim of this was to determine signiﬁcantly cooperative
TF tuples that are assumed to be decisive regulatory drivers.
Here, a tuple of n TFs is assumed to be decisive if the coexpres-
sion of the target genes signiﬁcantly increases with the reﬁnement
induced by binding site constraints of an n-th TF. To quantify

Fig. 5. Cell cycle expression proﬁles of all genes targeted by MET4 or
MET32 (gray) are compared with the reﬁned set of target genes where
MET4 and MET32 bind as a colocalized complex with the two binding
sites at pairwise distance between 750 and 50 bp (black). The increase in
expression coherence between the targets of the individual TFs and the
targets of a colocalized complex is highly signiﬁcant (Table 2)

this measure, we used the methodology of Pilpel et a]. (2001) with
an expression coherence scoring (ECS) based on the correlation.
To obtain a more accurate description of the binding mechanism,
in addition to the unconstrained target genes shared by a set of
TFs, also mutual targets were considered that allowed for colo-
calization of the TFs. These were deﬁned as binding regions
where all TFs showed pairwise distances in the range of 750 to
+50 bp, which means overlaps and corecruitment were con-
ceded. Also, targets of mediated cooperativity were deﬁned as
the genes that allowed for pairwise distances between 10 and
50 bp, and targets with supposed direct cooperativity were re-
stricted to (L10bp.

Seventeen higher-order TF combinations led to a signiﬁcantly
increased ECS in the context of the cell cycle (PdECS<0.05) for a
certain binding mode. As an example, Figure 5 shows the com-
plex-induced refinement in expression coherence among the
target genes of the TF pair MET4/MET32. Subjected to GO
term enrichment analysis, 76% of the corresponding target
gene sets were signiﬁcantly enriched with specific biological pro-
cess annotations (P<0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Table 2 sum-
marizes the results of the evaluation. Not surprisingly, all
significant tuples were associated with either cell cycle control
itself or with metabolic processes that are in crosstalk with the
cell cycle during normal growth. Most tuples are supported by
literature evidence (Supplementary Table S14).

4 CONCLUSION

TF complexes are highly modular combinatorial assemblies and
thus clearly different from large self-contained functional protein
complexes. Our novel DACO approach was found to give super-
ior results to established complex prediction programs for the

Note: Owing to the number of permutations of the test, the lowest possible value is PdECS : 10'4. The calculations were conducted for different conceivable modes of targeting
(all shared target proteins, direct adjacency, mediated adjacency and colocalization) to have a detailed picture of the possible target7gene sets. Only the most enriched GO
process term is shown for each target set. The inferred regulatory inﬂuence on the rate of transcription is abbreviated as follows: + (increase), 7 (decrease), o (no statement

Abstract

Summary: ChlA—PET is rapidly emerging as an important experimental approach to detect chroma—
tin long—range interactions at high resolution. Here, we present Model based Interaction Calling
from ChlA—PET data (MICC), an easy—to—use R package to detect chromatin interactions from ChlA—
PET sequencing data. By applying a Bayesian mixture model to systematically remove random li—
gation and random collision noise, MICC could identify chromatin interactions with a significantly

 

higher sensitivity than existing methods at the same false discovery rate.

1 Introduction

High-throughput sequencing technologies aiming to detect chroma-
tin interactions are rapidly developing these years. Among them,
ChIA-PET (Fullwood et (11., 2009) can genome-widely detect chro-
matin interactions that are associated with the protein of interest. It
is suitable for studying physical interactions between regulatory
elements, such as enhancer—promoter interactions. However, ChlA-
PET experiment suffers from high levels of noises caused by chroma-
tin random collision events and random ligation in solution.
Therefore, it needs effective computational methods to process raw
ChIA-PET data.

Up to now, there are few tools in hand to deal with ChIA-PET
data. ChIA-PET tool (Li et (11., 2010) is the first one freely available
to the public, which combines P-values from hyper-geometric test
and an arbitrary and strict threshold for no less than 3 Paired-end
tags (PETs) to identify chromatin interactions. However, this strat-
egy does not consider random collision noise, and the cut-off for
PET-count may result in losing some relatively weaker but non-
random interactions. Recently, another method called ChiaSig
(Paulsen et (11., 2015) tries to take chromatin random collision events
into account. The authors showed an improvement than ChIA-PET
tool by comparing with 5C data. However, ChiaSig is much too

conservative, thus suffers from high false negative rate. Here we pre-
sent MICC, an easy-to-use R package to process ChIA-PET data. It
aims to detect chromatin interactions at a high sensitivity while con-
trolling false discovery rate (FDR) at a reasonable level. The input of
MICC is raw PET clusters derived from ChIA-PET data. The final
output of MICC includes: (i) a list of posterior probabilities that de-
scribe the PET clusters as true interaction clusters and (ii) the corres-
ponding FDR. MICC can always detect significantly more
interactions than ChIA-PET tool and ChiaSig at the same FDR on
different datasets. The interactions detected by MICC are also more
consistent between biological replicates.

2 Methods

Detailed description of MICC method could be found in supplemen—
tary methods. Here we briefly describe the principles. We first used
self-ligation PETs to call protein binding peaks and set them as an-
chor regions. Then inter-ligation PETs linking anchor regions were
grouped as PET clusters. For the sake of simplicity, from here on,
the phrase PET mentioned later is only referred to inter-ligation
PET. To infer a PET cluster (A, B), where A and B are two anchor
regions linked by at least one PET, to be a True interaction PET

MICC have a significant fraction of overlapping with 5 C data, sug—
gesting MICC is feasible to search for weak interactions. These fea—
tures make MICC superior over other existing tools especially when
processing ChIA—PET data with less sequencing depth.

Abstract

Motivation: G protein—coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to how cells respond to their environ—
ment and a major class of pharmacological targets. However, comprehensive knowledge of which
pathways are activated and deactivated by these essential sensors is largely unknown. To better
understand the mechanism of GPCR signaling system, we integrated five independent genome—
wide expression datasets, representing 275 human tissues and cell lines, with protein—protein inter—
actions and functional pathway data.

Results: We found that tissue—specificity plays a crucial part in the function of GPCR signaling sys—
tem. Only a few GPCRs are expressed in each tissue, which are coupled by different combinations
of G—proteins or B—arrestins to trigger specific downstream pathways. Based on this finding, we pre—
dicted the downstream pathways of GPCR in human tissues and validated our results with L1000
knockdown data. In total, we identified 154,988 connections between 294 GPCRs and 690 pathways
in 240 tissues and cell types.

1 Introduction

G protein—coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of
transmembrane signaling molecules—more than 800 distinct human
proteins. Each member of this family shares in a common seven trans—
membrane (7TM) ctr—helical fold. As highly versatile membrane sensors,
they regulate many physiological processes including immunization,
sensation, behavioral and mood regulation, homeostasis modulation
(Katritch et (11., 2012). GPCRs also emerge as crucial players in growth
and metastasis of many tumors (Dorsam and Gutkind, 2007).
Mutations in GPCRs have been linked to many human genetic diseases
including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), hypo— and hyperthyroidism, neph—
rogenic diabetes insipidus, bleeding disorder and even carcinomas
(Insel et (11., 2007; Schoneberg et (11., 2004).

GPCRs are activated by a heterogeneous set of endogenous
ligands. These ligands may be light—sensitive compounds, odors,

pheromones, hormones and neurotransmitters. Due to their accessi—
bility on cellular membranes, their central role in cell communica—
tion, and the wide variety of potential functions, GPCRs are the
targets for nearly one third of modern small molecule therapeutics
(Hopkins and Groom, 2002).

GPCRs are transducers of extracellular stimuli to signal intracel—
lular changes. In their inactive state, GPCRs are bound to a hetero—
trimeric G protein complex including three subunits, G0,, GB and G7.
The binding of an extracellular ligand will initiate a conformation
change in GPCR, which then activates the bound Go, subunit. The
activated Go, subunit dissociates from the complex by an exchange
from GTP to GDP. The dissociated Go, and G137 subunits binds to
other intracellular proteins to trigger downstream signaling or
metabolic pathways separately (Digby et (11., 2006). Meanwhile,
G—protein—coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are recruited to the

fects (Metaye et 111., 2005). In the whole process, the signal of ligand Prote so ran ducers :S‘,‘

is passed from GPCR to two types of transducer molecules: G pro—
tein and B—arrestin, contributing to G protein—dependent signaling
and G protein—independent signaling, respectively.

GPCRs are usually expressed at low levels, with 1% of genes in
the genome only accounting for 0.001—0.01% of expressed sequence
tags (Fredriksson and Schioth, 2005). What’s more, expression lev—
els of GPCRs vary dramatically by tissue. Regard et al. analyzed
transcript levels of 353 GPCRs in 41 adult mouse tissues and found
that GPCRs that are highly expressed in a given tissue usually ex—
hibit important function to that tissue. For example, light—detecting
opsins are highly and specifically expressed in eye, and dopamine,
gamma—aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are highly expressed in
central nervous system (Regard et (11., 2008). These findings suggest
that GPCR signaling system consists of different expressed proteins
depending on the tissue type and target different downstream path—
ways to fulfill tissue—specific functions.

Driven largely by their utility in drug development, the study of indi—
vidual GPCR function and their downstream target pathways has be—
come a research topic of great importance. With this information, many
new avenues of research are available. For example, the action of path—
ways without any direct drug targets can be modulated through tar—
geting the GPCRs that trigger them. In addition, the downstream
pathways in the target tissue of a drug can be connected to cellular
mechanism or on—target side effects of the drug while the downstream
pathways in other tissues can be connected to the off—target side effects.
However, the low expression level and difficulty in crystallization have
made comprehensive analyses so challenging that most GPCRs still re—
main the ‘terra incognita’, or unexplored territory, in functional gen—
omics (Katritch et (11., 2012; Regard et (11., 2008; Tobin et (11., 2008).
Importantly, GPCRs do not interact with intracellular proteins directly,
but through the coupling of G protein or recruitment of B—arrestin.
Studying the direct partners of GPCRs will not reveal their down—
stream effects. Research has shown that transducer isotypes can have
distinct interacting partners and signaling roles. For example, Go,S sub—
unit can activate CAMP—dependent pathway by stimulating the produc—
tion of cAMP while G0,, inhibits the production (Birnbaumer, 2007).
B—arrestin2 mediates dopaminergic synaptic transmission while
B—arrestin3 actives ERK—1/2 pathway (Beaulieu et (11., 2005; Oakley
et (11., 2000). Exactly which B—arrestins and G proteins associate with
each GPCR and if this varies by tissue type remains unknown, further
complicating the systematic identification of GPCR—targeted pathways.

We introduced a data—driven method GOTE, to systematically
predict GPCR Dgwnstream Pathways Signaling by Tissue Expression
(Fig. 1). With many genome—wide expression profiling datasets of dif—
ferent human tissues or cell types available, we were able to identify
the expressed proteins of GPCR signaling system in each tissue type,
these include the GPCR proteins themselves as well as the transducer
proteins (G—proteins and B—arrestins). We hypothesized that if the pro—
teins of a pathway significantly interact with the transducer isotypes
in a particular tissue, then the pathway is more likely to be the signal—
ing outcome of the GPCRs that are highly expressed in that tissue.
Based on this hypothesis, we designed a statistical test to evaluate the
association between pathways and GPCRs in each tissue and applied
it to five independent datasets (four from normal tissues, one from
cancer cell lines). We tested the robustness of GOTE by comparing
the similarity of results across the normal human tissue datasets. We
found both concordance and discordance in the predicted pathways.

Fig. 1. Workflow and data used in GOTE. The left side shows the workflow of
GOTE. The center gives a simple description of each step. The right side
shows the data used in each step. In the first step we used tissue expression
data to find specifically expressed GPCR in each tissue. Second, for each
transducer (G-protein or ﬁ-arrestin), we obtained a list of binding proteins
using the BioGRID PPI data. Third, the list of binding proteins is filtered by tis-
sue expression, resulting in lists of tissue-specific binding proteins. Fourth,
pathway enrichment analysis is performed based on the tissue-specific bind-
ing proteins of each transducer using Fisher's Exact Test. For each pathway, a
Z—score is calculated for each transducer. Fifth, for each pathway, the Z—scores
of all G-proteins are combined together using Stouffer's Method. The weight
of each Z—score is in proportion to the tissue expression of each G-protein.
The same analysis is repeated for the Z—scores of all ﬁ-arrestins. Finally, path-
ways with significant Z—scores are connected to GPCRs expressed in the
same tissue as G-protein dependent pathways (those which are associated
with G-proteins) or G-protein independent pathways (those which are associ-
ated with ﬁ-arrestins)

The predicted pathways of some GPCRs such as CASR, TBXAZR,
CXCR4 and GPR5 6 can be connected to their molecular function or
cause of disease by our method. Due to the lack of true standard spe—
cifying the true relationship between GPCR and pathways, we used
GPCR knockdown datasets to perform a weak validation, in which
we observed whether the expression of a pathway is significantly
changed after the knockdown of GPCR. We concluded with a discus—
sion of the potential uses of these results, such as the study of complex
human disease or molecular mechanism of drugs. All of our data and
code are made publicly and freely available.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Materials

2.1.1 Genes in GPCR signaling system

We downloaded 401 GPCRs and their class information from
Gtode (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/DATA/targets_and_
families.csv) (Southan et (11., 2015), 53 G—proteins from ngB (http://
biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/ngB/retrieve.jsp) (Theodoropoulou et (11.,
2008). All GPCRs were classified into 6 main classes by Gtode: A,
B, C, D (Adhesion), F (Frizzled) and O (Others). The gene symbol ID
we used for 4 B—arrestins are SAG, ARRB1, ARRB2 and ARR3. The
binding proteins of G—proteins and B—arrestins were identified
through BioGRID Human PPI network release of 3.4 (Chatr—
Aryamontri et (11., 2013).

2.1.2 Gene expression data
We chose five gene expression datasets deriving from three differ—
ent platforms and covering both cancer cell line and normal

human tissues (i) Human U133A Gene Atlas (referred as U133A in
this paper) (Su et (11., 2004): a compendium of all transcript ex—
pression data in 84 human tissues running on the Affymetrix
U133A microarray platform. This dataset was downloaded from
BioGPS (Wu et (11., 2016). (ii) Human NCI60 Cell Lines (referred
as NCI60 in this paper): a collection of all transcript expression
data in 108 cancer cell lines running on the Affymetrix U133A
microarray platform. This dataset was also downloaded from
BioGPS (Wu et (11., 2016). (iii) HPM_RNA and (iv) HPM_PRT
were both released from the Human Proteome Map (Kim et (11.,
2014). They used Mass spectrometry to measure the levels of pep—
tide sequences in 30 human tissues and mapped them to Human
Refseq protein sequences (HPM_PRT) and corresponding Refseq
genes to infer RNA level expression (HPM_RNA). (v) GTEx
Analysis V6 RNA—seq data (referred as GTEx in this paper) (Melé
et (11., 2015): a collection of transcriptome data in 53 human nor—
mal tissues running on the Illumina TrueSeq RNA sequencing
platform (we used the ‘Gene RPKM’ file provided). We mapped
all the array or gene IDs in five datasets to Uniprot protein ID
(UniProt Consortium, 2014) and the average expression value was
calculated if multiple arrays were mapped to a same Uniprot ID.
Next, we converted all the expression value x to log2(x + 2) to ad—
just for 0 and extremely large values, so that all the converted val—
ues are no less than 1. We then normalized the expression of each
gene by the median of all tissues, and took the log conversion
again so that the final value will follow an approximate normal
distribution across all the genes. Then, we calculated a Z—score
based on the normal distribution to represent the level of differ—
ential expression of a gene in a tissue. Z—score was converted to
P—value with the ‘pnorm’ function in R.

2.1.3 Reactome pathways

We used Reactome pathways as data source for pathways (Croft
et (11., 2014). The Uniprot to pathway mapping file was downloaded
from http://www.reactome.org/download/current/UniProt2Reacto
me.txt. In this paper, we considered 2223 pathways with size be—
tween 5 and 500.

2.2 Methods

2.2.1 Predicting downstream pathways of GPCRs

There are four parameters in GOTE: P—value threshold of GPCR t1
and a threshold for GPCR specificity score t2, P—value threshold of
binding protein t3, P—value threshold of enriched pathways t4. We
set t1, t3 and t4, as 0.05 and t; as 0 in this paper.

First, we found the GPCRs that are specifically expressed in each
tissue. To quantify the correlation between a GPCR and all the tis—
sues in one dataset, we calculated a GPCR specificity score Sgpc, for
a tissue defined as following:

0(ngcr 2 t1) Tgpc,
gpcr :

cr : —
1(pgpcr < t1) ZAll Tissues TSP”

where pgpc, is the expression P—value of GPCR in that tissue. And
those with Sgpcr greater than t; were considered as GPCRs specific—
ally expressed in that tissue.

Next, we connected downstream pathways to specific GPCRs in
that tissue through the binding proteins of transducers (G—protein or
B—arrestin). For each transducer, we found its binding protein
through BioGRID PPI network and those with expression P—value
less than t; were selected as highly expressed binding proteins. We
then assessed the correlation between binding proteins and each
Reactome pathway by one side Fisher’s Exact Test (Fisher, 1922).

Then, we combined the Z—scores from every transducer by Stouffer’s
Z—score method to obtain a final Z—score for each pathway
(Stouffer, 1949).

w-Z-
Zcombine : Z I I
V Z w?

Here, the Z—score of every transducer were combined with a
weight w,, referring to the expression of tranducer 1'. Thus, a trans—

 

ducer with high expression in the tissue will have more inﬂuence on
the downstream pathway. Eventually, we used ‘pnorm’ function in
R to transform Z—score into P—value. The pathways with P—value less
than t4 were considered as our predicted downstream pathways for
those specific GPCR mentioned above. The pathways were classified
into G—protein dependent pathways (deriving from the binding pro—
teins of G—protein) and G—protein independent pathways (deriving
from the binding proteins of B—arrestin).

2.2.2 Expression dataset from L1000 gene knockdown
experiment

We downloaded the expression dataset of 448 737 gene knockdown
experiments from lincscloud.org with perturbation type of ‘trt_sh’
(Duan et (11., 2014). In each experiment, a gene was knocked down
in a particular cancer cell line and the expression of all the genes
was measured before and after the knockdown. In total, 11 617 ex—
periments were found to knock down a GPCR gene. Altogether, 145
unique GPCRs and 16 cell lines from NCI60 were included in
L1000 gene knockdown dataset. Four levels of data are provided by
lincscloud.org: raw, unprocessed ﬂow cytometry data (level 1),
Gene expression values (level 2), normalized expression value (level
3) and signatures with differentially expressed genes computed by
robust z—scores for each profile relative to population control (level
4). We used level 4 data, Z—score of each gene representing the level
of expression change after the gene knockdown. We then pre—
processed the dataset by mapping array IDs to Uniprot IDs. The
average Z—score was calculated if multiple array IDs were mapped
to a same Uniprot ID.

2.2.3 Defining a weak reference standard for GPCR target
pathways

Since the absolute value of Z—score represents the level of gene ex—
pression change after the knockdown, we quantified the expression
change of a pathway by using Stouffer’s method to combining all
the Z—scores (absolute value) of genes in the pathway.

N
2 Vi)
Zpathway : 17W

N represents the number of genes in a pathway. A pathway
with Zpathway greater than 4.08 (correspond to P—value < 2.2e—05,
corrected for multiple hypothesis testing) is considered to experi—
ence significant change after the knockdown of a GPCR in a cell
line. Such pathways are defined in our weak standard as a ‘posi—
tive’ and the rest, with no significant change, are defined as ‘nega—
tive’. If GOTE identified a number of pathways as ‘positive’ for a
GPCR g in a cell line c, we obtained the reference standard of
’positive’ and ‘negative’ from the experiment with g knocked
down in 6. Then we calculated precision (TP/TP +FP), recall (TP/
TP+FN) and specificity (TN/TN +FP). The performance of
GOTE was compared to the following two methods: (i) HighExp:
we created this method as a comparison to GOTE. GOTE

91oz ‘Og JSanV uo salaﬁuv soc] harmonica JO AJtsraAtuf] 112 /3.10'spzu.tnoip.ttho'sopizurJOJHtotq/ﬁduq 11101} papaolumoq

connects the tissue—specific GPCRs to the pathways that are en—
riched by the tissue—specific binding proteins of transducers, while
HighExp connects the tissue—specific GPCRs to all the tissue—
specific pathways without considering the information from trans—
ducers. In each tissue, we found all the proteins with expression P—
value less than t; and performed pathway enrichment analysis
with Fisher’s Exact Test based on these proteins. The pathways
with P—value less than t4 are defined as tissue—specific pathways.
The pathways predicted by GOTE are usually a subset of the path—
ways predicted by HighExp. (ii) Random: we created this method
to represent null distribution. In this method, we randomly
assigned pathways to each GPCR without considering any other
information.

3 Results

3.1 GPCR signaling system has different expressed
proteins in distinct tissues

We found that the GPCR signaling system is highly tissue—specific
across all five datasets. Each GPCR is highly expressed in 3—5% of
all tissues in five datasets (Supplementary Figs S1—S5). We found
that on average 7.84 i 1.11 GPCRs in U133A, 8.83 i 0.60 GPCRs
in NCI60, 12.23 i 2.00 GPCRs in HPM_RNA, 10.40 i 2.00
GPCRs in HPM_PRT and 27.56 i 3.00 GPCRs in GTex are highly
expressed in each tissue when using P—value of 0.05 as a threshold
for high expression (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and the remainder ex—
hibit no or very low expression in both RNA (Supplementary Figs
S1—S3 and S5) and protein level (Supplementary Fig. S4). We found
tissue specificity for 57 signaling transducers, 53 G—proteins and 4 [3—
arrestins, as well (Supplementary Fig. S7—S11). On average, only
1—2 transducers are highly expressed in each tissue (Supplementary
Fig. S6A) and each transducer is highly expressed in 3—5% of all the
tissues (Supplementary Fig. S6B).

We then looked at the binding proteins of transducers. About 31
of 53 G—proteins and 4 of 4 beta—arrestins have protein—protein
interaction data available from BioGRID. Among 31 G—proteins, 15
belong to or subunit, 5 belong to [3 subunit and 11 belong to y sub—
unit (Supplementary Fig. S12). The binding proteins of different
transducer are enriched with different Reactome pathways
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). For example, GNAIZ mediates
the cell—cell junction and adherence (P—value < 1073, Supplementary
Table S1) while GNAII initiates the adenylate cyclase inhibitory
pathway (P—value < 1074, Supplementary Table S1). For B—arrestins,
isotype 3 is significantly associated with protein translation while
isotype 4 interacts with NOTCH1 signaling process (P—val—
ue< 1072, Supplementary Table S2). We found that binding pro—
teins were also tissue—specific. On average, only 3—5% binding
proteins are highly expressed in each tissue and each binding protein
is highly expressed in 3—5% of all the tissues (Supplementary Figs
S13—S17).

3.2 Using tissue—specific expression to predict down—
stream pathways of GPCRs

A workﬂow of GOTE is shown in Figure 1 (for details, refer to
Section 2). As a data—driven method, the goal of GOTE is to use ex—
pression data to find specific GPCRs and pathways in each tissue
and connect them together. The specific pathways were found
through enrichment analysis of proteins binding to each transducer
(G—proteins and B—arrestins) of GPCR with more highly expressed
transducers having more inﬂuence on the recruitment of down—
stream pathways.

3.3 Concordance and discordance of findings in five
datasets

We used GOTE to predict downstream pathways of GPCRs in five
expression datasets described in the section 2.1.2. General statistics
of results were summarized in Table 1. Of all five datasets, GTEx
has results for the largest number of GPCRs in both G—protein de—
pendent pathways and G—protein independent pathways (237 and
215). With the exception of U133A dataset, we found more G—pro—
tein dependent pathways than G—protein independent pathways. On
average, each GPCR were connected to pathways in 1—9 tissues. The
standard deviations of all these statistics are large, suggesting the
number of pathways and tissues varies by GPCR. We also compared
the size of predicted pathways in five datasets (Supplementary Fig.
S18). The median size of predicted pathways is relatively consistent
among five datasets (distributed between 6 0and 80) and with no sig—
nificant difference from the size distribution of all pathways from
Reactome (P—value > 0.05, t—test).

Next, we compared the G—protein dependent and independent
pathways predicted in each tissue. The results of HPM_PRT dataset
is shown in Table 2 and the other datasets are shown in
Supplementary Table S4. In HPM_PRT, we connected 277 G—pro—
tein dependent pathways and 167G—protein independent pathways
to 119 GPCRs. For simplicity, we classified all 30 tissues in HPM_
PRT dataset into eight systems (Supplementary Table S3). All the
systems except Immune have more G—protein dependent pathways
than G—protein independent pathways. Reproductive system has the
most G—protein dependent pathways while Immune system has the
most G—protein independent pathways. The overlap between G—pro—
tein dependent and independent pathways in each system is not

significant by Fisher’s Exact Test (P—value > 0.5). This is consistent
in all five datasets (Supplementary Table S4). However, the G—
protein dependent and independent pathways predicted across all
systems are significantly overlapped with each other (P—value:6.
96e—06), suggesting the overlap happens between different systems.
This is also consistent in all five datasets (Supplementary Table S4).
Many pathways were repeatedly predicted in more than one tis—
sue (Supplementary Table S5). For G—protein independent pathways,
the common pathways are consistently associated translation and
cell cycle process across five datasets. For example, ‘Eukaryotic
Translation Elongation’ is one of the top 10 most common

ent pathways in the cancer cell lines dataset—NCI60 are related to
apoptosis, consistent with other studies (Ahn et (11., 2009; Revankar
et (11., 2004). By comparison, the common G—protein dependent
pathways represent a variety of biological process and vary by data—
sets. For example, neural pathways such as ‘Transmission across
Chemical Synapses’, ‘GABA receptor activation’ are commonly pre—
dicted in HPM and GTEx dataset. Pathways about other signal
transduction system such as ‘Signaling by Hippo’, ‘Activated TLR4
signaling’ and ‘Nuclear events mediated by MAP kinases’ are com—
monly predicted in U133A and NCI60 dataset. In addition, we also
found G—protein dependent pathways participate in the regulation
of ion channel through pathways such as ‘Activation of G protein
gated Potassium channels’ and ‘Inhibition of voltage gated
Ca2+ channels via Gbeta/gamma subunits’ in GTEx dataset.

3.4 Class C and D GPCRs are commonly connected to
pathways in nervous system

We used bar plot to show the number of G—protein dependent
(Fig. 2A) and independent (Fig. 2C) pathways predicted for each
GPCR in HPM_PRT (The other four datasets are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S19—S22). We chose HPM_PRT because the tis—
sues in the dataset are diverse and cover eight various human anat—
omy systems. All the GPCRs were grouped by their class annotation
from Gtode. Class A, B and F GPCRs have downstream pathways
in various systems while class C and D show preference on particu—
lar systems. For example, class C GPCRs, including calcium—sensing,

GABA and glutamate receptors are commonly connected to G—pro—
tein dependent pathways in nervous system. Class D (Adhesion)
GPCRs are commonly connected to G—protein dependent pathways
in nervous and cardiovascular system. Class D is also commonly
connected to G—protein independent pathways in the immune
system.

The number of predicted pathways varies greatly by GPCR. For
example, CALCRL, a calcitonin—gene—related peptide receptor has
223 predicted G—protein dependent pathways from a variety of sys—
tems, the most among all GPCRs (Fig. 2A) while GPCRs such as
CCKAR, a Cholecystokinin receptor that Mediates smooth muscle
contraction of the gall bladder and stomach only have one predicted
G—protein dependent pathway in the digestive system. G—protein de—
pendent pathways appear in all eight systems while G—protein inde—
pendent pathways mainly appear in immune, reproductive and
cardiovascular system (Fig. 2A and C).

3.5 GPCR—pathway associations recapture known
pharmacology

ATC is a pharmacological classification system based on the organ
or system of action. Since GPCR are the targets of nearly one third
of modern drugs, we compared the tissues and downstream path—
ways of GPCRs predicted by GOTE with the ATC classification of
the drugs that target them (Supplementary Methods). For each
GPCR, we calculated the proportion of drugs that belong to each
ATC category (Fig. 2B).

Most drugs in ATC system target class A and C GPCRs. Many
overlaps can be found when comparing the systems of a drug given by
ATC and the systems connected to the GPCR by GOTE. For example,
all three drugs targeting PTGIR act in ‘Blood or blood forming organs
(B)’ according to ATC system, while in our results, PTGIR is con—
nected platelets (cardiovascular system, Fig. 2B). In platelets, PTGIR
is connected to 39 downstream pathways in such as ‘Platelet activa—
tion, signaling and aggregation’ (P—value : 0.0016, ranking No. 3 in
G—protein independent pathways, Supplementary Table S6).

Extracellular calcium—sensing receptor (CASR) is the target of
cinacalcet, a drug that acts as a calcimimetic to lower calcium level in
blood (Shoback et (11., 2003). This drug is classified into ‘systemic hor—
monal preparations (H)’ by ATC and its target CASR is connected to
endocrine system by GOTE since it is uniquely expressed in pancreas
(the pancreas belongs to both endocrine and digestive system, we clas—
sified it into endocrine system). Thirty—two downstream pathways are
connected to CASR in pancreas by GOTE. The most significant one is
‘Depolarization of the Presynaptic Terminal Triggers the Opening of
Calcium Channels’ (P—value: 1.50e—06, ranking No.1 in G—protein
dependent pathways, Supplementary Table S6 ).

Many GPCRs are the targets of drugs belonging to the ‘Nervous
(N)’ class according to ATC. They are significantly overlapped with
the GPCRs connected to the nervous system by GOTE (Fig. 2D).
Pearson correlation coefficient between them is 0.543 (P—val—
ue: 1.76e—10). The Pearson correlation coefficient between GPCRs
connected to digestive system by GOTE and GPCRs with drug classi—
fied into ATC—Alimentary tract (A) is 0.435 (P—value : 7.60e—07).
The Pearson correlation coefficient between GPCRs connected to
urinary, reproductive system by GOTE and GPCRs with drug classi—
fied into ATC Genito—urinary(G) is 0.424 (P—value : 1.57e—06).

3.6 The similarity of results depends on the similarity of
cell types

We expect GOTE to predict similar pathways in similar tissues or
cell types. To evaluate this hypothesis, we calculated the pairwise

Jaccard similarity of predicted pathways between the same type of
cell lines in NCI60. We paired together cell lines of the same and dif—
ferent cell types. The Jaccard similarity is shown as barplot in
Figure 3A. On average, the G—protein dependent pathways predicted
among similar cell types have a Jaccard similarity of 0.141 t 0.028,
higher than those predicted among different cell types
0.067 t 0.006 (one side t—test P—value 25.26e—06). The results are
similar for G—protein independent pathways (0.141 t 0.049 versus
0.063 t 0.005, one side t—test P—value : 1.83e—03).

We also calculated pairwise Jaccard similarity of predicted path—
ways for all tissues in U133A dataset. The result is shown as heatmap
in Figure 3B (G—protein independent pathways) and Supplementary
Figure S23 (G—protein dependent pathways). Two clusters of tissues
can be observed. Tissues in the same cluster have high Jaccard simi—
larity to each other and belong to the same system, either neural
(green cluster) or immune (red cluster).

3.7 Distinct datasets show consistency in predicted
pathways

We calculated the pairwise Jaccard similarity of predicted pathways
between the same tissue type in different datasets to test the ro—
bustness of GOTE against systematic error deriving from different
platforms. The results were compared with a null distribution
(Random) deriving from randomly assigning pathways to tissues
(Supplementary Methods). The Jaccard similarity was shown as bar—
plot in Figure 3C.

The comparison was conducted pairwise between four datasets
containing normal tissues: U133A, HPM_RNA, HPM_PRT and
GTEx. The results between GTEx and two HPM datasets were
not shown because few overlapped tissues exist between them. Of
all four datasets, HPM_RNA and HPM_PRT have the highest
Jaccard similarity in predicted pathways. The average is 0.79 (95%
CI: 0.66—0.92, P—value:6.34e—11 compared to Random) for G—
protein dependent pathways and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50—0.87, P—val—
ue:1.1e—05) for G—protein independent pathways. U133A and
GTEx have high Jaccard similarity in predicted G—protein independ—
ent pathways. The average is 0.15 (95% CI: 0.10—0.20, P—val—
ue:0.001 compared to Random). The similarity between U133A
and two HPM datasets was not significant.

3.8 Predicted pathways go through expression change
after GPCR knockdown experiment

We validated our GPCR—tissue—pathway predictions using an inde—
pendent dataset from the L1000 experiment which measured the ex—
pression change of all genes after a GPCR was knocked down (Duan
et (11., 2014). Using these expression data, we defined a weak refer—
ence standard that connects GPCRs to pathways by identifying sig—
nificantly differentially expressed pathways in the knockdown
experiment. For comparison, the performance of GOTE was com—
pared to two other methods we created: HighExp and Random.
HighExp looks at any pathway that is highly expressed in the tissue
(not just the subset of pathways predicted for the GPCR by GOTE).
Random represents the null distribution (Section 2.2.3).

We focused on the results of GOTE in NCI60 dataset since the
cell lines used overlap with those used in the L1000 dataset. The pre—
cision, recall and specificity of results were calculated for three
methods (Table 3). For G—protein dependent pathways, 92 connec—
tions between of GPCR and tissue can be evaluated (11% of all re—
sults). On average, the precision of GOTE is 0.22 i 0.05,
significantly outperforms two other methods (HighExp:
0.13 i 0.03, Random: 0.08 i 0.03). The recall of GOTE is

3.9 Increasing the cutoff of GPCR specificity contributes

to high—confident results

We studied the inﬂuence of four parameters on the results of GOTE.
These four parameters are as follows: (1) The P—value threshold for
highly expressed GPCRs t1 is to control the number of highly

expressed GPCR in each tissue; (2) The GPCR specificity score
threshold t; is to control the connections between GPCR and tissue.
(3) The P—value threshold for highly expressed binding proteins of
transducers t; is to control the number of binding proteins used for
enrichment analysis; (4) The P—value threshold for enriched path—
ways t4 is to control the number of enriched pathways. In a default
setting, we use 0.05, 0, 0.05 and 0.05 for the four parameters to gen—
erate results. Here, the range of each parameter was expanded to a
wider range to test inﬂuence on a benchmark statistics representing
how much GOTE outperforms HighExp in precision.

The line graphs in Figure 4 show the benchmark statistics against
each of four parameters. The P—value threshold of GPCR, binding
protein and pathway do not have a strong inﬂuence on the accuracy
of results (Fig. 4A, C and D). In contrast, different threshold of

of four line graphs, the X—axis indicates the threshold (or 1/threshold in B) of
one parameter. The y—axis indicates how much GOTE outperforms HighExp in
precision when setting the parameter to the threshold of X—axis (the other
three parameters as default setting). The four parameters are: (A) t1: the
P—value threshold for highly expressed GPCRs. (B) t2: the GPCR specificity
score threshold. (C) t3: the P—value threshold for highly expressed binding pro-
teins of transducers. (D) t,.: the P—value threshold for enriched pathways

GPCR specificity can lead to a dramatic change in the benchmark
statistics (Fig. 4B). As the threshold for GPCR specificity score
approaches to 1, GOTE significantly outperforms HighExp in
precision.

4 Discussion

In this paper, we presented a data—driven method, GOTE, to system—
atically identify the downstream pathways of GPCRs in each tissue.
We used gene expression datasets to find highly expressed binding
proteins of G—proteins or B—arrestins in each tissue and performed
pathway enrichment analysis to find enriched pathways. Then we
connected the enriched pathways to specifically expressed GPCRs in
the tissue as their downstream pathways. We found that the pre—
dicted pathways differ by tissue and GPCR while similar tissues
have similar predicted pathways. With no true standard available,
we created a ‘weak’ standard on our own with an independent data—
set from L1000 gene knockdown experiment, to validate our
GPCR—tissue—pathway predictions. In the validation, we tested the
correlation between the knockdown of GPCR and the change of ex—
pression in downstream pathways. As co—expression is only a pre—
requisite of actual connection, this standard is less stringent and will
unavoidably bring in some false positives. We controlled for this
error by comparing the results to a null distribution Random and
another reference method HighExp that connects highly expressed
pathways to GPCRs in each tissue. GOTE outperforms both two
methods in precision and specificity. GOTE has lower recall than
HighExp because it chooses the tissue—specific pathways that are
also enriched by the binding proteins of transducers. Thus GOTE is

more stringent and is expected to have fewer predictions than
HighExp.

As a data—driven method, our prediction results are dependent
on the expression dataset used. Unfortunately, most current expres—
sion data are derived from different platforms. We tested the robust—
ness of GOTE among four datasets with normal human tissue, each
using a different technology. The similarity of predicted pathways
between datasets is in alignment with the expression similarity
(Supplementary Fig. S24), where the results are highly consistent be—
tween two mass spectrometry datasets and less consistent between
these two mass spectrometry dataset and the microarray dataset. In
addition, the five datasets do not employ a standard tissue naming
scheme. This may contribute to a situation where a same name of
tissue can refer to different types of cells in the tissue, which adds
the difficulty of comparing predicted pathways between different
datasets. Another limitation of GOTE is our current strategy of
mapping GPCRs to their transducers. The relationship between
GPCRs and transducers has not been well studied. Therefore, we
used co—expression in the same tissue to connect GPCRs to trans—
ducers in GOTE. Consequently, this may bring in some false positive
pairs of GPCRs and transducers since the correlation in expression
does not necessarily mean the existence of actual connection be—
tween GPCRs and transducers. To mitigate these potential false
positives, we provided a parameter in GOTE that controls GPCR
tissue specificity. We showed that by setting a high threshold of this
parameter, users can get more confident connections between GPCR
and downstream pathways at the cost of fewer predictions.

We found our findings on many GPCRs agree with their molecu—
lar function, cause of disease, or the action of corresponding drug
provided by other resources. For example, we found class C and D
GPCRs are commonly connected to G—protein dependent pathways
in nervous system. While class C GPCRs consists of calcium—sensing,
GABA and glutamate receptors, which are synaptic receptors
located primarily on neuronal cells, and class D GPCRs are reported
to play an important role in brain development (Yona et (11., 2008).
We also found the tissues connected to GPCR in our results correlate
with the ATC classification of corresponding drug. GPCRs such as
CASR, PTGIR are predicted with pathways in agreement with the
molecular mechanism of their corresponding drugs (Supplementary
Table S6). Some GPCRs have predicted pathways validated by other
studies. For example, CXCR4, one of the co—receptors of HIV—1 in
immunological cells participate in the activation of ion channels
after the binding of gp120 (Lee et (11., 2003). We found this GPCR is
connected to both HIV—related pathways (such as ‘HIV
Transcription Initiation’) and ion channel—related pathways (such as
‘Voltage gated Potassium channels’) in CD8 Cells (Supplementary
Table S7). Another GPCR GPR56 is regulated by Blimp—1 in NK
cells (Chang et (11., 2016), which is a transcription factor and modu—
lates the MHC Class I antigen—processing and peptide—loading path—
way (Doody et (11., 2007). In our results, this GPCR is connected to
the ‘Class I MHC mediated antigen processing 86 presentation’
pathway in NK cells (Supplementary Table S8). Eventually, since
GPCRs participate in controlling an extraordinary variety of physio—
logical functions, mutations in GPCR can cause many complex dis—
eases (Insel et (11., 2007; Schoneberg et (11., 2004). The pathways we
predicted for these GPCRs may help us study the mechanism of
these diseases. For example, mutations in TBXAZR, a thromboxane
receptor (TP), will cause a bleeding disorder in human body (Hirata
et (11., 1994). In our results, this GPCR is connected to blood clotting
pathways such as ‘Platelet activation, signaling and aggregation’ (P—
value : 1.62"“e—03, ranking 3, Supplementary Table S9) in platelets.
Meanwhile, we also found other interesting pathways such as

plays an important role in skin wound healing events. Together with
fibrin, it increases or stabilizes the volume and porosity of the clot
and then serves as a physical support through which cells are
trapped in the clot (Weigel et al., 1986).

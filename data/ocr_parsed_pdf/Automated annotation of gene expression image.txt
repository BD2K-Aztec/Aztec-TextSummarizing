ABSTRACT

Motivation: Computational approaches for the annotation of pheno-
types from image data have shown promising results across many
applications, and provide rich and valuable information for studying
gene function and interactions. While data are often available both at
high spatial resolution and across multiple time points, phenotypes are
frequently annotated independently, for individual time points only. In
particular, for the analysis of developmental gene expression patterns,
it is biologically sensible when images across multiple time points are
jointly accounted for, such that spatial and temporal dependencies are
captured simultaneously.

Methods: We describe a discriminative undirected graphical model to
label gene-expression time-series image data, with an efficient training
and decoding method based on the junction tree algorithm. The ap-
proach is based on an effective feature selection technique, consisting
of a non-parametric sparse Bayesian factor analysis model. The result
is a flexible framework, which can handle large-scale data with noisy
incomplete samples, i.e. it can tolerate data missing from individual
time points.

Results: Using the annotation of gene expression patterns across
stages of Drosophila embryonic development as an example, we dem-
onstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy, gained by jointly
annotating phenotype sequences, when compared with previous
models that annotate each stage in isolation. The experimental results
on missing data indicate that our joint learning method successfully
annotates genes for which no expression data are available for one or
more stages.

1 INTRODUCTION

The use of high-throughput image acquisition, such as in pheno-
typic screens, has been quickly increasing and thus provides a
new source of data for computational biologists. Microscopy of
colored or ﬂuorescent probes, followed by imaging, is able to
deliver spatial and temporal quantitative phenotype information
such as gene expression at high resolution (Busch et al., 2012;
Ljosa et al., 2009; Walter et al., 2010). In addition, expression
patterns can be documented and distributed over the internet as
a valuable resource to the research community. Recent advances
in throughput, or long-term investment in speciﬁc projects, have
by now generated large collections of images. Such image data-
bases are traditionally analyzed through direct inspection by
human curators; an example is the Berkeley Drosophila
Genome Project (BDGP) gene expression pattern database

(Tomancak et al., 2002, 2007). In this dataset, images are as-
signed to stage ranges within the 17 embryonic stages deﬁned
by developmental features, and annotated collectively in small
groups using a controlled vocabulary (CV), i.e. annotation terms.
This allows researchers to search image databases and compare
spatial and temporal embryonic development.

Given the very diverse nature of imaging technology, samples
and biological questions, computational approaches have often
been tailored to a speciﬁc dataset. For example, the image-based
profiling of gene expression patterns via in situ hybridization
(ISH) requires the development of accurate and automatic
image analysis systems for using such data, to understand regu-
latory networks and development of multicellular organisms.
Images are affected by multiple sources of noise due to experi-
ments or microscopy (incomplete or multiple embryos, variance
of probes across genes, illumination artifacts), making the extrac-
tion and registration of embryos non-trivial (Fowlkes et al., 2005,
2008; Harmon et al., 2007; Keranen et al., 2006; Kumar et al.,
2002; Mace et al., 2010; Puniyani et al., 2010;). Peng and Myers
(2004) and Peng et a]. (2007) introduced an automatic
image annotation framework using various high-dimensional
feature representations and classifying frameworks: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), wavelets, Gaussian mixture
models, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Quadratic Discrimi-
nant Analysis. Each image may show the embryo under different
views: lateral, dorsal or ventral; this is a challenge for gene an-
notation, as embryonic structures may be visible in only certain
views. Yet, recent studies have shown that incorporating images
from multiple views could consistently improve the annotation
accuracy (Ji et al., 2009; Pruteanu-Malinici et al., 2011).

It is desirable to represent images in a way that takes advan-
tage of image features and offers robustness to image distortions.
In contrast to such large feature sets prone to high redundancy
and high computational costs, Frise et a]. (2010) identiﬁed a set
of basic expression patterns in Drosophila. A set of 39 well-
deﬁned clusters describing speciﬁc regions of embryo expression
were determined from 2693 lateral views of early development.
As with the majority of described approaches, this study involved
a high level of human intervention in selecting ‘good’ images for
training/testing purposesia potential drawback, considering the
rapid increase in the size of ISH image collections. In contrast,
Pruteanu-Malinici et a]. (2011) proposed a new approach for
automatic annotation of spatial expression patterns using a
‘vocabulary’ of basic patterns that involved little to no human
intervention. This work provided a ﬂexible unsupervised frame-
work in competitively predicting gene annotation terms, while
using only a small set of features.

A particular aspect that has been largely neglected by compu-
tational approaches so far is that data acquired from such experi-
ments often span multiple time points or conditions. Phenotypes
are typically annotated stage-by-stage, without jointly learning
the salient temporal dependencies across multiple time points,
which should allow for an overall higher accuracy; e.g. the an-
notation terms predicted for earlier stages should inform the
prediction at later stages. Furthermore, many genes are anno-
tated with more than one term from the vocabulary, creating an
additional dependency structure between annotations within the
same stage range.

In this article, we address the automatic annotation of
Drosophila embryo gene expression sequences, building on
state-of—the—art models from computer vision and machine learn-
ing. There are several challenges that need to be addressed when
approaching this problem through computational methods. As
we mentioned previously, the image acquisition process results in
embryonic structures with multiple perspectives, shapes and lo-
cations. Moreover, the shape/position of the same embryonic
structure may vary from image to image: ‘variation in morph-
ology and incomplete knowledge of the shape and position of
various embryonic structures’ have made the gene annotation
task more prohibitive (Ji et al., 2008).

We ﬁrst show that a non-parametric Bayesian factor analysis
(BFA) approach, the inﬁnite factor model, allows for an efﬁcient
and sparse feature representation of the Drosophila gene expres-
sion dataset. Then, we propose a conditional random field (CRF)
to tackle the time-evolving annotation task. Experiments show
that the exploitation of dependencies across adjacent
developmental stages leads to annotation accuracy superior to
existing Drosophila gene expression annotation approaches. The
proposed framework also tackles the missing data scenario: for
many genes, one or more stage ranges are absent from the image
collection; in such cases, human annotators would take into ac-
count the entire set of expression data from adjacent stages to
successfully annotate the available images. The challenge to auto-
matize this process is novel and represents a step closer toward a
fully automatic gene annotation pipeline. These predictions can be
later analyzed by biologists to assess the correctness of the image
acquisition and the level of interest for that particular gene.
Finally, for a given gene, the described framework predicts the
entire set of annotation terms simultaneously, taking full advan-
tage of the term dependencies that exist at the stage-range level.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we
focus on data description and introduce the sparse BFA-CRF
framework. Experimental results are reported in Section 3, fol-
lowed by conclusions and future work in Section 4.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data description

One of the most popular large-image expression datasets is the BDGP
collection of embryonic expression patterns. The project started with a
ﬁrst release of images for 2000 genes; the second release was in 2007 with
6000 genes. Release number 3 came in 2010 bringing the total to 7500
genes, including 97% of the sequence-speciﬁc transcription factor genes.
As of today, the collection consists of over 105000 images, which docu-
ment patterns of embryonic gene expression for over 7400 of the 13 659
protein-coding genes identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome.

Expression is visualized by RNA ISH, which provides an effective way of
locating speciﬁc mRNA sequences by hybridizing complementary
mRNA-binding oligonucleotides and a suitable dye (Tautz et al., 1989).

The mRNA expression apparent in the captured in situ images was
veriﬁed by independently derived microarray time-course analysis using
Affymetrix GeneChip technology (more details can be found at http://
insitu.fruitﬂy.org, and in Tomancak et al., 2002). Gene expression pat-
terns were documented by taking low (2x) and high (20x) magniﬁcation
images, at multiple developmental stages. The low-magnification digital
images were taken to capture groups of embryos, to provide a permanent
record of the hybridization in each well. Each slide was then further
examined under higher magniﬁcation using a Zeiss Axiophot optical
microscope. Images were assigned to developmental stage ranges follow-
ing the sequence of events taking place at speciﬁc times after fertilization,
using the 17 stages deﬁned in (Campos-Ortega, 1985). In this analysis, we
focused on the ﬁrst 15 hr of Drosophila development, spanning embryonic
stages 4%, 778, $10, 11712 and 13716. Developmental stages 173 were
skipped owing to predominant ubiquitous expression patterns not of
interest to our analysis.

Any gene is represented, on average, by approximately 12 images;
however, the number of images per gene varies from 1 to 80. This vari-
ability reﬂects the BDGP strategy to document highly dynamic, complex
and novel patterns, while lowering the number of images documenting
common expression patterns. Among those, there are images with non-
inforrnative patterns due to poor-quality staining/washing or non-tissuei
speciﬁc expression (maternal or ubiquitous). Images within the same
window can show different patterns due to embryo orientation or the
relatively long developmental time spanned by a stage range. Images are
annotated with ontology terms from a CV describing developmental ex-
pression patterns (Fig. 1). This vocabulary has been developed and
reﬁned by FlyBase (The FlyBase Consortium, 2002) over the past few
years, allowing human curators to compare their ﬁndings with expression
data assembled from the literature, expansion of annotations to greater
detail and thorough searches of datasets based on Gene Ontology
schema. The annotations used throughout this project consisted of a
subset of about 300 of the 5800 annotation terms in the FlyBase CV,
many of which only apply to later stages of development.

As mentioned previously, we use all available images in our approach,
i.e. including those taken with any embryo orientation: lateral, dorsal and
ventral. Before extracting features, we segmented and registered images
using a previously described probabilistic segmentation approach based
on statistical shape models (Mace et al., 2010). This provides us with
240 x 120 pixel images, mostly containing a single embryo in a standard
dorsal(up)/anterior(down) orientation and no background. In Figure 1,
we show a particular gene expression pattern across ﬁve developmental
stage ranges of interest. The complexity and variability of the image data
led to competitive but not perfect results, in terms of precise embryo
extraction as well as embryo orientation, which increased the challenge
of automatic gene annotation.

We here use the average intensities in a down-sampled ﬁxed grid size of
80 x 40 pixels as input features for the entire collection of images within
the BDGP dataset.

2.2 Feature extraction—sparse BF A

Sparse Bayesian factor analysis (sBFA) is a statistical method for model-
ing many dependent random variables through linear combinations of a
few hidden variables (Gorsuch, 1983). This model is designed to address
the high-dimensional setting where hundreds or thousands of genes are
simultaneously examined. The sparsity assumption is the key feature in
our model that allows us to scale stable and accurate inference to a large
number of images/genes represented by many image input features.

For high-dimensional models, sparsity helps prevent sampling errors
from swamping out the true signal in data, leading to stable parameter
estimates. In our framework, sparsity implies that each image/gene is

levels

affected only by a few underlying estimated factors, and as a result, many
of the mixing weights in the model will be (near) zero.

The sparse Bayesian factor model was derived using the following
matrix representation:

X 2 AS + E (1)
where X: [x], xz. .. x,,] is a px n dimensional data matrix, with n the
number of features, quantifying the associated gene-expression values for
[7 images (genes) under consideration. Each row of X is called a gene
pattern with dimension 1 x n. Here, we assume that each gene pattern
is already normalized to zero mean. A is the factor loading matrix with
dimension [7 x k, which contains the linear weights. S is the factor matrix
with dimension k x n, with each element modeled by a standard normal
distribution. Each column of S is the factor score for feature [(i = 1, 2,. . . ,
n) and each row is called a factor. E is the additive Gaussian noise with
dimension [7 x n. Both A and S are inferred by the model simultaneously.

From the model we can see that each row of X is modeled by a linear
combination of the factors (rows of S), indicating that the variability of
the original [7 feature patterns can be explained by only k latent factors.
The model can also be written in vector form as follows:

xj=aj8+8j(j=1,2,...,p) (2)

where x; and a; denote the jth row of X and A, respectively, and the basis
matrix S is shared across all samples. Indeed, factor analysis is an un-
supervised dimensionality reduction method used widely in data analysis
and signal processing (Prince et al., 2008).

To impose the sparsity required by the underlying biological assump-
tion where spatial gene expression patterns are modeled only by a few
domains (factors), we used the Student-t distribution, which consists of a

Gaussian distribution and a Gamma prior on the precision parameter.
The sparseness is directly controlled by the precision parameter 07/3,"; the
objective of imposing sparseness is to automatically shrink most elements
in A near zero. The updating equations, along with a full description of
the sparse factor model used in this manuscript can be found in Pruteanu-
Malinici et a]. (2011).

For an extension of our previous work, which largely focused on
two developmental stage ranges only, the number of factors (k) for
every developmental stage range needed to be determined in an ideally
unbiased fashion. For this, we used an adaptive Gibbs sampler, which
automatically truncated the loading and factor matrices through an
adaptive selection of the number of important factors. This sparse
Bayesian inﬁnite factor model, ﬁrst introduced by Bhattacharya and
Dunson (2011), obviates the need for pre-specifying the number of
factors; the effective number of factors (here denoted by k*) is
chosen such that the contribution from adding additional factors is
negligible. This approach has been shown to produce accurate esti-
mates of the true effective number of factors k*; the adaptation of
the Gibbs sampler occurs every 10 iterations at the beginning of the
Markov chain but decreases in frequency exponentially fast, so as to
satisfy the diminishing adaptation condition in Theorem 5 of Roberts
and Rosenthal (2007). More speciﬁcally, the decreasing frequency is
modeled as an exponential

PU) = CXPQYO + 061!) (3)

at the tLh Gibbs iteration with 050 and or] chosen so that adaptation occurs
every 10 iterations initially but then decreases in frequency exponentially
fast. The loadings matrix is adaptively modiﬁed by monitoring the

columns with all elements within some pre-speciﬁed small neighborhood
of zero. For some iterations, columns may be discarded or a new column
could be simply added to the matrix; the remaining parameters of the
model are modiﬁed accordingly. The parameters of the factors (in the
case of adding some) are estimated from their prior distribution to ﬁll in
the necessary values.

2.3 Conditional random ﬁelds

Probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks and random
ﬁelds are increasingly popular choices for statistical modeling of complex
biological relationships. Although Bayesian networks provide a viable
solution for directed acyclic relationships where the direction of causality
can be easily identiﬁed, undirected graphical models offer a clear advan-
tage for highly connected relational structures that are not simple chains
or trees. Among undirected models, CRFs (Lafferty et al., 2001) have
proven to be among the most powerful predictors owing to their inher-
ently discriminative (rather than generative) nature.

In a CRF, the observable variables (X = {X,-}) and unobservable vari-
ables (Y: {Y,-}) are treated separately, with the unobservables globally
conditioned on the observables. The relationships among the unobserv-
ables are modeled via an undirected graph G = (Y,E), in which the Yis are
the nodes (vertices), and edges E g Y x Y are pairs (Yi, If); the edges
serve to denote direct non-independence relations between pairs of Yis. In
particular, a node Y,- is taken to be conditionally independent of all other
nodes 1’], given the immediate neighbors N6 of Y,- in the graph:

P(YiIIYk¢i}) = P(YiING(Yi)) (4)

for NG(Yi) = {YinKYia Y/)EE}'

The well-known Harnmersley£lifford theorem (Hammersley and
Clifford, 1971) provides a means of computing conditional densities via
decomposition of the graph into cliques. In particular,

stant; it is assumed that P(Y) >0 for all possible joint assignments to Y.
CI), is called the potential function for clique I; in practice, these are often
pooled among like-sized cliques. Because cliques larger than some rea-
sonable size N are typically ignored, modeling is accomplished by choos-
ing a suitable set {<1>1, (1)2, . .. EDN} of potential functions for different
clique sizes; the MS and any additional parameters of the (D’s can be
trained discriminatively via cross validation.

Exact inference with a CRF is tractable if the graph can be converted
into a chain or a tree. To this end, a junction tree can be obtained by
collapsing tight clusters of nodes into meta-nodes and extracting a max-
imal spanning tree from the resulting structure (Jensen et al., 1990;
Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988). The sumiproduct algorithm (Pearl,
1988) can then be applied to propagate local densities across the tree,
permitting exact computation of posterior probabilities for joint or indi-
vidual value assignments to nodes in the graph, or identiﬁcation of the
maximum a posteriori assignment; for linear-chain CRFs, these are analo-
gous to the well-known ForwardiBackward and Viterbi algorithms for
hidden Markov models (Rabiner, 1989).

To infer the presence or absence of speciﬁc annotation terms for indi-
vidual embryo images, we constructed a CRF structured as shown in
Figure 2. Each node Y,- denotes the status of an annotation term:
Y,-=1 means present (the annotation term applies to the image), Y,-=0
means absent (the annotation term does not apply). Columns correspond
to developmental stages. All of the nodes in a column are directly con-
nected via an edge to all nodes in adjacent columns (blue lines). Within a
column, the nodes are connected in a linear chain (i.e. each node has
exactly 1 or 2 neighbors within the column), with the order of the chain
chosen so as to maximize the total mutual information between all

adjacent pairs in the chain; this maximization was carried out via a stand-
ard traveling-salesman heuristic in Matlab. Each column was constrained
to include only the most popular annotation terms in the training parti-
tion (for more details, see Results). The sparse image factors (previous
section) were included as observables X,; the Xis were speciﬁc to each
column, and numbered from k: 57 to k: 160, depending on develop-
mental stage, with later stages having more factors.

We deﬁned potential functions for cliques of size up to 2:
<1>l(Y,-, X)=A1 log P(XlYi), and (1)203, If), X)=A2 log P(Yi, X), where
P(Yi, I?) is a multinomial and P(Xl Y,-) is a multivariate Gaussian with
diagonal covariance, both trained by simple counts (maximum likeli-
hood) from the training partition during cross validation (see Results).
Coefﬁcients A1 and A2 were estimated by maximizing the training-parti-
tion classiﬁcation accuracy via simple hill climbing. (1)1 we refer to as the
node potential, as it is associated with single-node cliques, and (1)2 we refer
to as the edge potential, as it is associated with two-node cliques (individ-
ual edges in the graph).

3 RESULTS

In this section, we describe the application of a sparse BFA-CRF
framework for automatic time-course gene expression pattern
annotation. Our procedure starts by extracting sparse meaning-
ful features (sBFA) from the entire collection of Drosophila em-
bryos, suitable for downstream temporal analysis based on a
conditional-random-ﬁelds approach. We then use the estimated
factor loadings as observed variables in the CRF framework, so
as to infer most likely annotation terms for previously unseen
images.

3.1 Factor inference/decomposition of expression patterns

The BDGP collection divides early embryogenesis of Drosophila
into six developmental stage ranges, 173, L6, 778, 9710, 11712,
13716, and most of the CV terms are stage-range speciﬁc. As
mentioned previously, we skipped stage range 173 owing to lack
of informative images, as well as a low number of annotation
terms associated to it. We applied the sBFA model to the entire
set of images from the five stage ranges of interest. These
spanned thousands of images (Table 1), with each stage being
annotated by a set of 407150 annotation terms. To illustrate the
potential of the sBFA for decomposing expression patterns into
meaningful features, we show selective estimated factors from
developmental stages 9710. The model began with the set of
5929 embryo images and estimated the loadings and factor
matrices while having full control of the degree of sparsity
(throughout our analysis, the sparsity on the factor loading
matrix A was controlled by a scale parameter of the Gamma
prior distribution on the precision parameter a, ho: 10—6).
Figure 3 illustrates a selection of the estimated factors that, per
ensemble, correspond to lateral, dorsal and ventral views,
demonstrating the ability of the model to automatically extract
distinct patterns for different embryo orientations. As mentioned
in ‘Materials and Methods’ section, the number of factors was
determined in an unsupervised fashion, for every developmental
stage range, using the sparse Bayesian inﬁnite factor model. The
estimated number of factors can be found in Table 2; in addition,
we compared these findings with an empirically determined esti-
mation akin to Pruteanu-Malinici et al., 2011. As illustrated in
Table 2, the range of factors is similar for both scenarios: fully
unsupervised (inﬁnite factor models) or estimated by underlying

biological assumptions (generate and test). A convergence check
on the estimated number of factors for two randomly chosen
stage ranges is illustrated in Figure 4. Similar to the sBFA ana-
lysis, the Bayesian inﬁnite factor model was run for 6000 Gibbs
iterations, discarding the first 1000 and estimating the model
parameters on the remaining 5000 iterations.

The feature extraction/ selection process was followed by filter-
ing non-informative (such as ubiquitous) gene expression pat-
terns. Using Euclidean distances between estimated sparse
factor analysis weights and a null vector as reference, we sepa-
rated informative images from the non-informative ones (for a
full description see Pruteanu-Malinici et al., 2011). We success-
fully removed 2.&9% non-informative images (Table 1).

3.2 Large-scale annotation of time-course expression
patterns

In evaluating the performance of the sBFA-CRF framework, we

used the estimated sparse loadings/features only on the set of

genes in common between all five stage ranges of interest and

a repertoire of annotation terms from a CV. The most popular
annotation terms were independently selected for each stage
range, to cover ~85% of the entire set of genes. This resulted
in a set of 1807 images and 48 annotation terms distributed as
follows: 14 terms for stage range 46, 8 terms for stage range 778,
9 terms for stage range 9710, 9 terms for stage range 11712 and 8
terms for the last stage range 13716 (Table 1).

To assess the relative utility of various parts of our model, we
determined the prediction accuracy of the full model compared
with versions of the model handicapped in various ways. In par-
ticular, we considered including (in separate experiments) the
following sets of edges in the CRF:

0 Relationships across adjacent stage ranges and within stage
ranges (between annotation terms): blue and green lines in
Figure 2 (full model, scenario A).

0 Relationships across adjacent stage ranges only: blue lines in
Figure 2 (scenario B).

0 Relationships within stage ranges only: green lines in
Figure 2 (baseline, scenario C).

For example, when images are annotated for individual stage
ranges in isolation, the relationships indicated by the edges be-
tween adjacent stages are ignored. Two examples of Drosophila
expression pattern images across time are shown in Figure 5: we
are interested in modeling the edge potentials between develop-
mental stage ranges, as well as those between annotation terms
within each stage range.

Annotation accuracy was computed as a global measure,
across all annotation terms and stage ranges, by comparing the
ground truth (human curated labels) with the sBFA-CRF pre-
dictions. As previous methods had largely focused on the anno-
tation of individual stage ranges, one term at a time, and are
largely trained on heavily curated benchmark data rather than
the whole BDGP dataset, a fair comparison to these approaches
was not feasible. To put our approach into context, we therefore
compared the results generated by the sBFA-CRF framework
with our own recent binary Support Vector Machines (SVM)-
based classiﬁcation system described in Pruteanu-Malinici et al.
(2011). We had previously shown that this approach provides
competitive and often superior classiﬁcation results compared
with the best competing approaches, even when working with
the full BDGP image data instead of ‘cleaned’ benchmarks.

Our previous method used independent SVM classiﬁers for
each annotation term and stage range, disregarding relationships
within and between adjacent stage ranges. This resulted in lower

grid size of 80 x40 (developmental stage range 9—10). Different back-
ground colors are an artifact and not part of the model

Table 2. Comparison of the number of estimated factors in the BDGP set

annotation accuracy, as shown in Table 3. The SVM results are
comparable with the new CRF baseline scenario, which only
considers edge potentials between annotation terms within the
same stage range (both models simply ignore any temporal/tran-
sition information that might improve the overall accuracy). The
advantage of using the edge potentials between adjacent stage
ranges translates into an absolute increase of 3—4% in accuracy
(i.e. a relative reduction of the error rate of >20%). All models
were applied to the same set of 1807 images, using 10-fold cross
validation; mean values across ﬁve runs are shown.

3.3 Missing-data annotation analysis

In addition to improved gene annotation accuracy, the sBFA-
CRF framework provides an elegant means of annotating
images in missing-data scenarios. During CRF decoding, the
most likely conﬁguration of the model (i.e. values of the unob-
servables, Y) is computed using relationships between adjacent
stage ranges, as well as within each stage range. In the case of
missing data, the most likely state for a given node Y, with no
directly related observables X is estimated entirely through rela-
tionships in the random ﬁeld. This allows us to infer annotation
terms for missing images, which is of utmost importance in scen-
arios where, for a given gene, data have been collected for only a
subset of the stage ranges.

In evaluating the performance of the sBFA-CRF model in
annotating missing data, we manually removed 5—25% of
images from the 1807 gene set, by randomly selecting genes
and removing their corresponding images; for missing images,
the node potentials were set to 1. Results are shown in Figure 6,
where the model included edge potentials between adjacent stage
ranges, as well as within stage ranges (CRF scenario A); we were
able to annotate with 80% or better accuracy even for scenarios
with 25% missing data. Remarkably, our model outperforms the
SVM classiﬁcation framework (which had access to full data)
even when 15% of the data are withheld from the sBFA-CRF.
Figure 7 illustrates particular cases with genes that are correctly
annotated, for stages where their images were missing. As previ-
ously mentioned, this is of particular interest to biologists who
require predictions for stages where images have not yet been
collected. Our results conﬁrm that the proposed time-course
pipeline leads to highly successful expression pattern classiﬁca-
tion, despite the presence of uninformative images, registration
errors and missing data in considerable amounts.

Lastly, we compared the sBFA-CRF predicted labels to the
human curated ones (the ground truth), so as to identify genes
and annotation terms for which the annotations were different
but the outcome from our model appeared consistent. We

recognize that for the same annotation term, the corresponding
regions in different images may have significant variations in
visual appearances, which would lead to a difﬁcult manual an-
notation task and could sometime generate ambiguous out-
comes. We show three examples for which the sBFA-CRF
annotations are opposite from the human curated ones and are

likely correct given the full context (Fig. 8). For all three scen-
arios, we conﬁrmed our ﬁndings with the BDGP human
curators. Arguably, the model was correct in predicting differ-
ent annotation terms in the following examples, including gene
FBgn0003502, where human curators initially decided that
expression in ‘procephalic ectoderm AISN’ is not detected for
stage range 4e6; however, the sBFA-CRF predicted label,
as well as a second careful visual inspection, would suggest the
contrary. In addition, we identiﬁed another instance where ‘ven-
tral ectoderm anlage’ should have been annotated for gene
FBgn0022073 in stage range 778. The last scenario (gene
FBgn0033988) corresponds to a case where all images are ex-
tremely difﬁcult to annotate owing to out-of-focus staining
issues or overall noise. On a second inspection, the model was
arguably correct in labeling the annotations for both stage ranges
4e6 and 9710.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have described a novel sBFA-CRF model to automatically
annotate Drosophila embryo gene-expression time-course data.

Fig. 7. Missing-data gene annotation analysis. Shaded boxes indicate the stage range for which data were missing (we manually removed those images).
In two cases, the entire set of annotation terms is correctly annotated within the stage range despite the fact that no images were available (third and sixth
rows). In these two scenarios, the CRF used the relationships across adjacent stages, to estimate the most likely conﬁguration. A selection of the correctly

and incorrectly annotated terms for the stage range with missing data are shown in the last two columns

The sparse BFA framework represents an efficient feature selec-
tion technique, which automatically determines the feature-space
dimension, using a non-parametric implementation. The learned
features are then used as observed variables in the CRF frame-
work, so as to infer most likely annotation terms for previously
unseen images. The CRF encodes temporal relationships be-
tween adjacent stage ranges throughout Drosophila development.
By capturing the temporal sequence, the model is able to predict
the entire collection of annotation terms in a single run and
achieves superior performance when compared with highly com-
petitive models that annotate stages in isolation. In addition to
improved annotation accuracy, the experimental results demon-
strate the success of the method in handling missing-data scen-
arios. This is extremely useful in real-life scenarios when
estimates are needed over the ensemble of annotation terms,
with only partial data being collected.

One promising extension to our approach would be to include
‘latent’ annotation terms in the CRF structure, to account for
additional rare annotation terms for which we would not attempt

to obtain a prediction. These latent terms could have limited con-
nectivity in the graph, so as to allow large numbers of latencies to
be included without compromising decoding efﬁciency. Such an
extension may well improve prediction accuracy for the primary
terms, even if the latent terms are themselves difﬁcult to accur-
ately predict (due to paucity of training data for those terms). It
would also increase the ﬂexibility of the resulting model: while we
currently select the primary annotation terms manually based on
their popularity among genes in a given stage range, a simple
threshold on the number of genes being annotated, together
with an appropriate means of ranking terms, would allow to
automatically partition the primary versus latent sets. Based on
our experience with the BFA-CRF model described here, add-
itional work along these lines seems promising.

Finally, we are continuing to develop this approach in close
collaboration with biologists so as to suggest outliers or interest-
ing patterns during the anticipated expansion of the BDGP col-
lection to the whole Drosophila genome. We plan to incorporate
the sBFA-CRF framework into a Fiji plug in (Schindelin et al.,

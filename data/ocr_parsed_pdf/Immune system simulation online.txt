ABSTRACT

Motivation: The recognition of antigenic peptides is a major event
of an immune response. In current mesoscopic-scale simulators of
the immune system, this crucial step has been modeled in a very
approximated way.

Results: We have equipped an agent-based model of the immune
system with immuno-informatics methods to allow the simulation of
the cardinal events of the antigenic recognition, going from single
peptides to whole proteomes.

The recognition process accounts for B cell-epitopes prediction
through Parker-scale affinity estimation, class I and II HLA peptide
prediction and binding through position-specific scoring matrices
based on information from known HLA epitopes prediction tools, and
TCR binding to HLA—peptide complex calculated as the averaged
sum of a residue—residue contact potential.

These steps are executed for all lymphocytes agents encountering
the antigen in a wide-reaching Monte Carlo simulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Computational methods for the study of the immune system have
grown to embed a great level of sophistication. Usually the level of
description adopted is that of cells. Discrete mathematical models
like cellular automata or agent based have shown to be more suitable
for representing the details of the immunological processes. Models
of the immune system include lymphocytes and antigens like viruses
or bacteria but they usually keep the description of the molecular
recognition events at a very simpliﬁed level. This however, is the
triggering event in the onset of the immune response.

Seeking for an adequate solution to this problem, we have
enhanced our agent-based model of the immune system Celada and
Seiden (1992) by embedding different in sillico methods for epitope
recognition based on statistical methods derived from machine
learning and trained on experimental data (Rapin et al., 2010).

The overall simulation is based on three events: (i) B-Cell epitopes
binding, (ii) Class I and II HLA epitope binding and (iii) TCR
binding to HLA—peptide complexes. These events are independently
executed by cells represented by agents and populating a given
simulated biological volume.

The outcome is a fully detailed tracking of the dynamics of
cell populations together with molecules involved in the epitope
recognition process including those immune complexes exposed on
the surface of antigen-processing cells.

2 METHODS

In the computational model described in Rapin et al. (2010). the original
idea of representing the shape space of lymphocytes” receptors in the binary
strings has been substituted with the representation of molecules through
their amino acid sequence. and the prediction of binding events relies on
in sillico epitope discovery and binding prediction methods.

For example. the interaction between the host T cells and pathogens relies
on position-speciﬁc scoring matrices developed in Rapin et al. (2008). Other
immune-informatics methods have also been incorporated. namely B-cell
epitopes prediction. and a general proteineprotein potential measure aimed
at estimating the binding afﬁnity between molecules.

The C-ImmSim simulator consists of >18 000 lines of ANSI C code.
Thanks to dynamic memory allocation and other optimization techniques.
it is possible to represent large simulated volumes and. most importantly.
a substantial immune repertoire. The high degree of complexity of the
underlying model makes it suitable to simulate the immune response to
pathogens.

The immune system simulation server presented here consists of a simple
interface to the simulation method mentioned above where the user can
specify the antigen injection schedule . the haplotype of the host and input a
few other parameters such as the simulation volume and duration (see Fig. 1).

The most important feature is the possibility to specify the antigen in terms
of its constituting proteins. The user can submit the antigen protein sequence
and specify the schedule of its injection as well as the host haplotype. Finally.
other input ﬁelds allow the user to specify the random initial repertoire. the
simulation duration and the simulated volume.

The ﬁrst input ﬁeld is used to get the molecular deﬁnition of the antigen/s
chosen to be injected either in FASTA format or as UniProt (The Universal
Protein Resource. http://www.uniprot.org/) protein accession codes or PDB
(The Protein Data Bank. http://www.pdb.org/). structure code or PDB ID
(i.e. primary identiﬁer) by which entries can be retrieved from the UniProt
and Protein Data Bank servers automatically.

The second input ﬁeld allows the user to specify the antigen injection
schedule with the following simple syntax:

[ALT] .Dn]: [A21T21D2]:  : [AmeDn]
to specify the n injections of different compounds with identiﬁer Ak
indicating the protein name in the fasta ﬁle ﬁeld or UniProt/PDB accession
number. Tk is the time step of the injection (1 simulation step: 8 h) and Dk
is the antigen dose in units per micro liters of volume.

Having speciﬁed the antigen. the user can chose the host haplotype by
means of the corresponding drop-down menus; two for HLA A. two for
HLA B and two for HLA DR. These choices determine the position-speciﬁc
scoring matrices used for epitope discovery during the simulation.

Fig. 1. The C-ImmSim online server allows the user to deﬁne the antigen to
be injected as a list of UniProt accession numbers, or PDB primary identiﬁers,
or, as a multiprotein FASTA text. The haplotype is deﬁned by drop-down
menus. Other parameters are the simulation time and the volume.

Once the input is set and the user launches the simulation, a new page
informs that the simulation has started and ask whether the user wants to
be warned upon completion. Depending on the simulated volume chosen,
the simulation can take from minutes up to several hours. The injection
schedule and the complexity of the pathogen itself also have an inﬂuence on
the simulation time.

The output page of the simulator shows a set of ﬁles corresponding to
population data (both total number of lymphocytes and the division between
clonotypes, cytokines and antibody concentrations per lattice point). Finally,
the user can also download a compressed archive containing the pictures
displayed on the page.

3 DISCUSSION

The immune system simulation server described here offers the
chance to test the overall immunogenicity of a generic protein
sequence in the form of its amino acids sequence. It is based on

an agent-based model of the immune system coupled with epitope
prediction tools derived from the ﬁeld of immuno-informatics and
novel methods to assess protein—protein binding afﬁnity on the
basis of the work performed by Miyazawa and Jemigan on protein
potentials (Miyazawa and Jemigan, 1996) that provides us with
a method for assessing the chances of direct interactions among
proteins in the simulation.

The proposed methods for assessing epitope discovery and
binding are embedded in the architecture in a modular way and
as such can be upgraded or substituted by more accurate methods
should one become available.

4 CONCLUSION

We have implemented as a web service a tool to calculate the
immune response to a generic pathogenic secondary structure. The
user inputs a sequence or a set of sequences comprising the interested
pathogen as FASTA sequences or by means of Uniprot identiﬁers,
then speciﬁes the injection schedule in terms of time and dosage.
The simulator will generate a virtual injection schedule and the
corresponding immune response (if any) to the peptides identiﬁed
in the secondary sequences speciﬁed in input. Other parameters are
customizable such as the simulated volume and the random seed
determining the speciﬁcity of the initial population of lymphocytes.
Since the method is of the Monte Carlo type, a larger volume will
result in more accurate data. Moreover, for the same reason, more
simulations will allow for better statistical power.

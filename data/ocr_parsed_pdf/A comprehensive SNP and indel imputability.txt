ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genotype imputation has become an indispensible step
in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Imputation accuracy,
directly influencing downstream analysis, has shown to be improved
using re-sequencing-based reference panels; however, this comes at
the cost of high computational burden due to the huge number of
potentially imputable markers (tens of millions) discovered through
sequencing a large number of individuals. Therefore, there is an
increasing need for access to imputation quality information without
actually conducting imputation. To facilitate this process, we have
established a publicly available SNP and indel imputability database,
aiming to provide direct access to imputation accuracy information for
markers identified by the 1000 Genomes Project across four major
populations and covering multiple GWAS genotyping platforms.
Results: SNP and indel imputability information can be retrieved
through a user-friendly interface by providing the |D(s) of the desired
variant(s) or by specifying the desired genomic region. The query re-
sults can be refined by selecting relevant GWAS genotyping plat-
form(s). This is the first database providing variant imputability
information specific to each continental group and to each genotyping
platform. In Filipino individuals from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and
Nutrition Survey, our database can achieve an area under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.97, 0.91, 0.88 and 0.79
for markers with minor allele frequency >5%, 3—5%, 1—3% and 0.5—
1%, respectively. Specifically, by filtering out 48.6% of markers (cor-
responding to a reduction of up to 48.6% in computational costs for
actual imputation) based on the imputability information in our data-
base, we can remove 77%, 58%, 51% and 42% of the poorly imputed
markers at the cost of only 0.3%, 0.8%, 1.5% and 4.6% of the
well-imputed markers with minor allele frequency >5%, 3—5%,
1—3% and 0.5—1%, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genotype imputation has proven to be a powerful tool in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by facilitating ﬁne
mapping and the merging of datasets from different genotyping
platforms (Li et al., 2009; Marchini and Howie, 2010). It is a way

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

to predict genotypes computationally based on linkage disequi-
librium patterns instead of obtaining genotypes by laboratory-
based procedure (Browning and Yu, 2009; Howie et al., 2011; Li
et al., 2010). As it has been shown to directly affect downstream
analysis, imputation accuracy needs to be taken into consider-
ation when designing and performing GWAS (Zheng et al.,
2011). For instance, at the study design stage, a question of
interest would be which commercially available genotyping plat-
form can provide the optimal imputation quality genome-wide
or in certain genomic region(s) of interest. Such a question can be
answered by assessing the imputation accuracy of relevant vari-
ants. However, there has been no resource available to provide
variant imputability information without actually performing
imputation.

A commonly used evaluation method is to mask a subset of
markers, impute their dosages and compare those dosages with
the true (masked) genotypes for those markers (Li et al., 2010).
This method, however, can only be used after genotypes have
already been obtained and therefore cannot help guide study
design decisions. In addition, the evaluation procedure can be
computationally costly because of the requirement of conducting
imputation, particularly with the emergence of reference panels
built through re-sequencing efforts (Sampson et al., 2012). To
facilitate genetic studies in the era of genomic re-sequencing, we
have built a database containing imputation accuracy informa-
tion for SNPs and indels identiﬁed from the 1000 Genomes
Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010), a
sequencing-based reference resource, which has demonstrated
its potential for enhancing the power of genetic association stu-
dies in the post-GWAS era (Day-Williams et al., 2011; Holm
et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012). The assessment of marker
imputability was carried out through a leave-one-out imputation
procedure: a single individual serves as the imputation target,
and imputation is performed using haplotypes from all the
other individuals as reference. Imputation accuracy was quanti-
fied within each of the four major continental groups surveyed
by the 1000 Genomes Project. We anticipate this database
containing imputation accuracy information searchable by
continental group and by GWAS genotyping platform will be
a useful resource for geneticists in this sequencing era.

indel discovered by and passing default quality ﬁlters in the 1000
Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2010). The dosage r2 of each variant reflects its potential imput-
ation accuracy when conducting imputation using haplotypes
from the 1000 Genomes Project as reference. Imputability infor-
mation is available for multiple genotyping platforms, and
separately for each of the four major continental groups
[Europeans (EUR), Africans (AFR), Asians (ASN) and
Americans (AMR)]. Details regarding sub-population constitu-
ents of the continental groups can be found at ftp://ftp-trace.
ncbi.nih.g0V/1000genomes/ftp/release/20110521/.

Methods: The dosage r2 of each variant was obtained using a
leave-one-out imputation procedure with MaCH—Admix (Liu
et al., 2012b; http://www.unc.edu/~yunmli/MaCH—Admix/)
[high Pearson correlation (0.8}094) with those obtained using
minimac (Howie et al., 2012) and IMPUTE2 (Howie et al.,
2011), and lower correlation (0.714185) with those from
BEAGLE (Browning and Yu, 2009), data not shown] on samples
from the latest release of the 1000 Genomes Project (version 3
March 2012 release, 2184 haplotypes). We mimicked typical
GWAS imputation practice by masking genotypes at markers
absent from the selected genotyping platform and treating
them as untyped. These untyped markers were imputed in one
individual at a time using the haplotypes of all the remaining
individuals as reference (2182 haplotypes). The imputation
accuracy of each marker, measured by dosage r2, was calculated
separately in each of four continental groups currently available
in the 1000 Genomes Project. The genotyping platforms we have
evaluated include Affymetrix 5.0, Affymetrix 6.0, Affymetrix
Axiom, Illumina HumanlM, Illumina Omni 5M and Illumina
Omni ZhongHua. The results of the assessment are searchable
through a publicly available database.

Usage: Our database can take as input either a list of marker
names or the start and end position of a genomic region on a
speciﬁed chromosome. Users can choose to View information
corresponding to one or more speciﬁc genotyping platforms.
Given the marker or region input and the choice of genotyping
platform, our database returns imputability information for vari-
ants of interest ordered by their genomic location according to
NCBI Build 37. Users have the option to display or to download
the imputability information for each continental group or the
maximum dosage r2 across the four continental groups (max-r2).
Moreover, users can ﬁlter results by max-r2. Markers with no
rsID follow chromosome:physical-coordinate nomenclature
(Supplementary Fig. SlA). In addition, for an SNPiindel pair
with the same genomic location, the SNP is always listed before
the indel (Supplementary Fig. SlB).

Examples: The first example shows the utility of our database
at the study design stage. Speciﬁcally, suppose an investigator
wants to decide between two genotyping platforms, Affymetrix
6.0 and Affymetrix Axiom, based on imputation accuracy within
a 1-kb region on chromosome 9p21 (22,095,555 to 22,096,555 bp)
harboring the SNP rs10757274 known to be associated with risk
of coronary heart disease and multiple related phenotypes
(Cunnington et al., 2010; McPherson et al., 2007). Our database
interface, the example query, as well as the results of the query
are shown in Figure 1. Given the regional input (start and end

position 22095 555 and 22096555 on chromosome 9), our data-
base returns a list of markers within the region (only the top
three are shown). For each marker, the database shows its
marker name, genomic location and dosage r2 for the two se-
lected genotyping platforms across four continental groups. To
ease comparison, users can choose to display max-r2 instead of r2
values for each population separately and/or ﬁlter by setting
non-zero max-r2 threshold. Based on what is shown in Figure
1, we would recommend the Axiom over the 6.0 panel, unless the
samples under study are Americans (e.g. Hispanic or African
Americans) and the SNP of primary interest is rs139492236.
Note that this is a toy example mainly meant to introduce the
interface of our database where we show only the top three
SNPs. For more realistic settings where the region of interest
typically includes many more markers, we recommend prioritiza-
tion of markers in the region (e. g. according to functional anno-
tation and/or evidence from existing association or functional
studies, if available), followed by the examination and compari-
son of the max-r2 distribution through ‘Download Results’ or
‘Genome-wide Graphical Comparison’. Such comparison of
imputation accuracy across platforms will facilitate decision
making regarding the choice of genotyping assays.

Once the investigator has decided on the genotyping platform,
a typical question is whether speciﬁc markers or markers in
speciﬁc regions of interest can be imputed well (e.g. novel vari-
ants or associated regions identiﬁed in other cohorts). When
computational resources are limited or when an investigator is
interested in a considerable number of markers/regions, imput-
ability information can help prioritize markers/regions that
have the potential to be well-imputed as well as avoid wasting
resources on markers/regions that have little potential for
high-quality imputation. As shown in Figure 1, our database
contains four dosage r2 values (one for each continental group)
for each marker, given a genotyping platform. As false-negatives
(markers that can be well-imputed but with bad predicted
imputation accuracy such that one would not perform actual
imputation) are typically more costly than false-positives
(the consequence would be wasted computational resources on
markers/regions that are truly not imputable), we recommend
using the maximum dosage r2 across the four continental
groups (max-r2) to guide decisions, particularly for samples
involving admixed individuals. Figure 2 shows the

receiver-operating characteristic curve for data from the Cebu
Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) when
max-r2 is used for thresholding. In this cohort of Filipinos
(Adair et al., 2011; Marvelle et al., 2007), we have 81 individuals
who have both Affymetrix 5.0 (Lange et al., 2010) and
Metabochip (Croteau—Chonka et al., 2012) genotypes. We
imputed the Metabochip SNPs from the Affymetrix 5.0 data,
using haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project as reference.
We computed the imputation accuracy in this sample
(CLHNS-speciﬁc dosage r2) by comparing the imputed dosages
with the genotypes obtained through genotyping using
Metabochip. The y-axis shows the proportion of poorly imputed
SNPs (CLHNS-speciﬁc dosage r2<0.2) removed and the x-axis
shows the proportion of well-imputed SNPs (CLHNS-specific
dosage r2>0.8) sacriﬁced for SNPs in different minor allele fre-
quency (MAF) categories (deﬁned within CLHNS). Using a
max-r2 threshold of 0.7, which removes ~15 million of the ~31
million markers in the latest release from the 1000 Genomes
Project, we found that the database filters out 77%, 58%, 51%
and 42% of the poorly imputed SNPs (again, SNPs with
CLHNS-speciﬁc dosage r2<0.2) at the cost of 0.3%, 0.8%,
1.5% and 4.6% well-imputed markers (SNPs with
CLHNS-speciﬁc dosage r2>0.8) in the MAF categories of
>5%, 375%, 173% and 0.&1%, respectively. Using a different
threshold of 0.5 (0.9), which removes ~12 (~20) million of the
~31 million markers, we can ﬁlter out 54%, 32%, 29% and 26%
(92%, 80%, 75% and 66%) of the poorly imputed SNPs at the
cost of 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.2% and 2.1% (4.8%, 6.1%, 7.5% and
17.2%) well-imputed SNPs. We also confirmed in samples of
Caucasians and samples of African Americans (data not shown)
that a max-r2 in the range of 0.}08 serves as a reasonable thresh-
old in terms of a trade-off between sensitivity and speciﬁcity. The
actual threshold an investigator selects can be tailored according
to MAF and available computational resources (including both
CPU times and disk space). We and others have previously

observed lower imputation quality for rarer variants (Li, et al.,
2011a; Liu et al., 2012a; The International HapMap 3
Consortium, 2010). Our database now shows that imputation
quality of rarer variants is also more challenging for prediction
estimation: the total area under the receiver-operating character-
istic curve is 0.97, 0.91, 0.88 and 0.79, respectively, for markers
with MAF >5%, 375%, 173% and 0.571%.

3 CONCLUSION

In summary, we have built a publicly available database for
marker imputability to aid genetic association studies in the
re-sequencing era (Fridley et al., 2010; Li, et al., 2011b;
Sampson et al., 2012). Reference panels built from re-sequencing
studies bring us the beneﬁts of improved imputation accuracy
and the potential to impute low-frequency variants. These bene-
fits come, however, at the cost of heavy computational burden
for imputation if we impute every marker discovered by sequen-
cing, which is >30 million in the latest release from the 1000
Genomes Project. It is therefore desirable to have direct access
to marker imputability information without actually conducting
genotype imputation. Our marker imputability database pro-
vides direct access to imputation accuracy information for
SNPs and indels identiﬁed from the 1000 Genomes Project
across four major continental groups using multiple genotyping
platforms. We anticipate that this database will serve as a useful
resource for researchers in this re-sequencing era in terms of
design and analysis of genetic association studies. In addition,
although the database is developed mainly for guidance before
actual imputation, it can be used for post-imputation quality
assurance by comparing estimated r2 values in the imputed
study sample with those in our database in an SNP-speciﬁc
manner. Using a cohort of Filipinos, we estimate that we can,
with up to 48.6% reduced computation efforts (by imputing only
the top 51.4% markers according to imputation quality esti-
mated from individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project), ﬁlter
out 42777% of poorly imputed markers at the cost of 0.37
4.6% well-imputed markers. Finally, two caveats should be
kept in mind by database users. First, we record results from
the MaCH-Admix software. Although more than moderate
level of correlation is observed with results from other imputa-
tion software, caution needs to be taken when generalizing to
other imputation methods, particularly those that are not based
on the Li and Stephens model (Li and Stephens, 2003). Second,
loss of some typed markers due to quality control in real studies
could lead to reduced imputation quality of speciﬁc markers,
which cannot be modeled generically and are thus not reﬂected
by our database. We will update the database when new data
releases of the 1000 Genomes Project or new genotyping plat-
forms become available.

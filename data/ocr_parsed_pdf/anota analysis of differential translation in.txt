ABSTRACT

Summary: Translational control of gene expression has emerged
as a major mechanism that regulates many biological processes
and shows dysregulation in human diseases including cancer. When
studying differential translation, levels of both actively translating
mRNAs and total cytosolic mRNAs are obtained where the latter is
used to correct for a possible contribution of differential cytosolic
mRNA levels to the observed differential levels of actively translated
mRNAs. We have recently shown that analysis of partial variance
(APV) corrects for cytosolic mRNA levels more effectively than the
commonly applied log ratio approach. APV provides a high degree
of specificity and sensitivity for detecting biologically meaningful
translation changes, especially when combined with a variance
shrinkage method for estimating random error. Here we describe the
anota (analysis of translational activity) R-package which implements
APV, allows scrutiny of associated statistical assumptions and
provides biologically motivated filters for analysis of genome wide
datasets. Although the package was developed for analysis of
differential translation in polysome microarray or ribosome-profiling
datasets, any high-dimensional data that result in paired controls,
such as RNP immunoprecipitation-microarray (RIP-CHIP) datasets,
can be successfully analyzed with anota.

1 INTRODUCTION

Translational control of gene expression acts primarily at the
initiation step of translation prior to peptide bond formation and
controls how many ribosomes are initiated per mRNA (Mathews
et (11., 2007), thereby enabling instantaneous control of gene
expression. Studies in many biological model systems and human
diseases have documented that such regulation can be mRNA
speciﬁc and can have large biological impact (Silvera et (11.,
2010; Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009). Genome-wide patterns of
differential translation nonetheless remain understudied, in part for
lack of adequate statistical analysis procedures (Larsson and Nadon,
2008).

Genome-wide translational control data are currently generated
using two approaches: polysome microarrays which involve

isolation of actively translating mRNAs that are probed with DNA
microarrays (Larsson and Nadon, 2008), and ribosome proﬁling
where RNA fragments that are protected by ribosomes are isolated
and sequenced (Ingolia et (11., 2009). Neither of these data types,
however, is independent of total cytosolic mRNA levels. In order
to study differential translation per se, it is therefore necessary to
correct the translationally active mRNA data for confounding total
cytosolic mRNA levels. We have recently shown that analysis of
partial variance (APV) in combination with the Random Variance
Model (RVM) (Wright and Simon, 2003) is an effective method
for such analysis that circumvents problems with the commonly
applied log ratio approach in combination with t-tests or analysis of
variance (ANOVAs) (Larsson et (11., 2010). In APV, a hierarchical
per gene linear regression is performed on translational activity
data, with cytosolic mRNA data and contrast vectors (which deﬁne
membership in sample classes such as genotype, treatment or
disease) as covariates. Class comparison effects are estimated by
calculating differences between class intercepts (Larsson et (11.,
2010).

As with all statistical procedures, it is important to evaluate model
assumptions. An interpretive problem arises in high-throughput
contexts, however, because of the large number of individual
statistical tests. In genome-wide analysis of translational activity,
for example, a number of genes are expected to fall outside of the
assumption space simply by chance. If the number of assumption
violations does not exceed chance levels, the data are behaving
as expected of a random variable and analysis can safely proceed.
Individual genes with serious violations of assumptions, however,
should nonetheless be interpreted with caution. Thus, genome-wide
application of APV to identify differential translation requires a
set of methods that assess the genome-wide performance of APV,
relates it to chance outcomes and provides ﬁltering capabilities
based on statistical and biological criteria. Here we provide the
(mom (analysis of translational activity) statistical package, which
is implemented in the R statistical computing language and contains
the analytical approaches and diagnostic outputs to guide such
analysis.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Identiﬁcation of differential translation within (mom is a two-step
process. Model assumptions are assessed, followed by identiﬁcation
of differential translation.

2.1 Assessment of model assumptions

Model assumptions are examined ﬁrst to determine if the data are
appropriate for (mom (Fig. 1A). If there are more violations of

assumptions than expected of a random variable, conclusions based
on (1noI(1 may be suspect. We note, however, that we have used
(mom with eight datasets, each of which met model assumption
requirements. These analyses were done on three published (Larsson
et (11., 2010) and three yet to be published datasets on translational
activity and two datasets from RIP-CHIP experiments. Assumptions
that can be examined in (1noI(1 include:

(i) Highly inﬂuential data points which may unduly affect
parameter estimates in the linear model. We compare the frequency
of highly inﬂuential data points (deﬁned by standardized deeta
[dfbetasD to values generated in simulated data. For the simulation,
translationally active mRNA data and total cytosolic mRNA data are
sampled from a normal distribution.

(ii) In APV it is assumed that the sample classes share a common
slope. (1noI(1 allows the user to assess this assumption by generating
a distribution of all cytosolic mRNA >< group interaction P-values
which test for differences among slopes. The P-values should
approximately follow a uniform distribution when the classes share
common slopes.

(iii) APV assumes homoscedasticity of residuals. This can be
evaluated within (1noI(1 by examining residuals as a ﬁmction of signal
intensity.

(iv) The APV model assumes that per gene residuals are normally
distributed. This assumption can be examined in (1noI(1 by comparing
per gene residuals to a simulation of residuals from a normal
distribution. Percentage of outliers is compared to what is expected
by chance.

If these four criteria are ﬁilﬁlled, (mom can be used to identify
differential translation. More details regarding the simulations and
guidance for interpreting outputs are found in the (mom manual.

2.2 Analysis of differential translation

Identiﬁcation of differential translation within (mom can be
performed in an omnibus mode (testing differences in translational
activity among three or more sample classes) and/or by setting
custom contrasts within the anotaGetSigGenes ﬁmction to specify
particular class comparisons (Fig. 1B). Both the omnibus and the

custom contrasts analyses are performed using APV with or without
RVM. We recommend the former when there are few replicates for
its superior statistical power (Larsson et (11., 2010). When applied,
RVM’s assumption that gene variances are random variables from
an inverse gamma distribution should be examined in (mom for
both the omnibus and the contrast tests. The RVM P-values for the
interactions described above (Point ii) should also follow a uniform
distribution under the assumption of a common slope among the
classes.

There are two additional biologically motivated slope
considerations when using anota. Slopes >1 should not occur
inasmuch as the actively translated mRNAs are a fraction of all
mRNAs. Similarly, although slopes <0 are biologically plausible,
they indicate complex regulatory mechanisms which are usually
not the primary focus. To address this, (1noI(1 tests whether slopes
are signiﬁcantly >1 or <0 and reports a P-value that can be used
for ﬁltering. Unrealistic slopes will likely be more common in
datasets with few replicates/sample classes and it is therefore
especially important to consider the slope when evaluating results
from such studies. Filtering of genes based on slope and many other
user-deﬁned criteria is done using the anotaPlotSigGenes function
which generates both a tabular summary and per mRNA graphical
representations of the APV analysis together with key statistics.
This output can easily be used to examine the performance of APV
for individual genes of interest. The output also includes intercepts
for each class which could be used, for example, in clustering of
translational activity levels. Nominal and various types of false
discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P-values can also be produced
and exported for further examination within R or other statistical
software.

2.3 Work ﬂow

Translationally active mRNA data and cytosolic mRNA data will
typically be analyzed within (1noI(1 using four main functions:
anotaPerfoerc, anotaResidOutlierTest, anotaGetSigGenes and
anotaPlotSigGenes (Fig. 1A and B).

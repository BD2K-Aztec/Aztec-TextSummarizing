ABSTRACT

An analysis of the distribution of the Nat-translocating ATPases/ATP
synthases among microbial genomes identified an atypical form of
the F1 Fo-type ATPase that is present in the archaea Methanosarcina
barkeri and Macetivorans, in a number of phylogenetically diverse
marine and halotolerant bacteria and in pathogens Burkholderia spp.
In complete genomes, representatives of this form (referred to here
as N-ATPase) are always present as second copies, in addition
to the typical proton-translocating ATP synthases. The N-ATPase
is encoded by a highly conserved atpDCQFlBEFAG operon and
its subunits cluster separately from the equivalent subunits of the
typical F-type ATPases. N-ATPase 0 subunits carry a full set of
sodium-binding residues, indicating that most of these enzymes
are Na+-translocating ATPases that likely confer on their hosts the
ability to extrude NaJr ions. Other distinctive properties of the N-
ATPase operons include the absence of the delta subunit from its
cytoplasmic sector and the presence of two additional membrane
subunits, Ath (formerly gene 1) and AtpR (formerly gene X). We
argue that N-ATPases are an early-diverging branch of membrane
ATPases that, similarly to the eukaryotic V-type ATPases, do not
synthesize ATP.

1 INTRODUCTION

FlFo-type (F-type) and V/A-type ATPases are membrane-anchored
rotary enzymes that couple translocation of H+ or Na+ ions across
the membrane to the synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP. Although
most of their subunits are evolutionarily related, the two classes
of ATPases have clear differences in structure and phylogenetic
distribution: F—type ATPases are found in bacteria, mitochondria
and chloroplasts, whereas V/A-type ATPases are found in eukaryotic
cell membranes (in particular, vacuoles), as well as in all archaea
and in some bacteria (Hilario and Gogarten, 1998; Forgac, 2007;
von Ballmoos et (11., 2008; Mulkidjanian et (11., 2009). V/A-type
ATPases are often subdivided into two classes based (i) on the ability
of the prokaryotic (A-type) enzyme to function in the direction
of ATP synthesis and (ii) presence of additional subunits in the

eukaryotic (V—type) enzyme that normally functions only as an ion-
translocating ATPase, using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to acidify
cellular compartments (Hilario and Gogarten, 1998; Forgac, 2007).

Structural characterization of the Na+-binding sites in the
c-subunits of F- and V—type ATPases (Meier et (11., 2005; Murata
et (11., 2005) allowed unequivocal assignment of the cation speciﬁcity
for the membrane ATPases encoded in numerous sequenced
genomes: only those c-subunits that contain full sets of Na+ ligands
appeared to transport Na+, the loss of at least one of those ligands
correlated with the loss of Na+ speciﬁcity (Mulkidjanian et (11.,
2008a; Meier et (11., 2009).

In the View of several reports on the sodium dependence of
energy-coupled reactions in cyanobacteria (Willey et (11., 1987;
Skulachev, 1988; Pogoryelov et (11., 2003), we have searched
cyanobacterial genomes for the Na+-translocating ATPases. We
found several apparently Na+-dependent cyanobacterial ATPases,
but always as second copies, in addition to the H+-translocating ATP
synthases. Here, we report the common properties of these ATPases,
which are encoded in apparently highly mobile operons and have
a set of speciﬁc traits that qualify them as a separate subfamily of
the F—type ATPases. Since these ATPases, besides forming a novel
subfamily, are always encoded next to the typical rotary ATPases
and are predominantly Na+-dependent, we refer to them hereafter
as N-ATPases.

2 METHODS

Phylogenetic distribution of the N-ATPase operons was deduced from
protein BLAST (Altschul et (11.. 1997) searches against the NCBI’S RefSeq
database (Pruitt 21111.. 2009) (last searched February 1. 2010) and veriﬁed by
examining gene neighborhoods of the retrieved ORFS and by checking for
the presence of the N-ATPase-speciﬁc subunit AtpR. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm with MEGA (Kumar et (11..
2008). Multiple alignments were constructed from BLAST outputs with
manual editing. Transmembrane segments were predicted using TMHMM
(Krogh et (11.. 2001). Sequence logos were drawn with WebLogo (Crooks
et (11.. 2004).

3 RESULTS

Search of the NCBI’s RefSeq database (Pruitt et (11., 2009) for
cyanobacterial c (proteolipid) subunits that would have a ﬁill set
of Na+-binding ligands (Mulkidjanian et (11., 2008a; Meier et (11.,
2009) returned ﬁve hits, all coming from marine cyanobacteria
(Supplementary Fig. S1a). In each case, the operon encoding the

Na+ -binding c subunit was present in the genome along with another
ATPase operon, encoding an H+-translocating F-type ATPase. As
depicted below for Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, an alignment of
the Na+- and H+-binding c-subunits (top and bottom, respectively)
from the same cyanobacteria revealed a Glu substitution of the Gln
residue (shown in blue) that serves as a Na+ ligand (uncharged
residues of the transmembrane segments are highlighted in yellow,
Na+ and H+ ligands are labeled with asterisks) Among the 4084

c-subunit sequences currently listed in the Pfam family ATP-synt_C
(PF00137; Finn et (11., 2010), only 227 (5.5%) contain a Glu residue
in that position and only ~1% combine it with a typical ESTXXY
Na+-binding motif (Supplementary Fig. S1). The Na+-dependent
ATPase operons in all cyanobacteria had a similar gene order,
with a single gene insertion in Acaryochloris marina and a two-
gene insertion in the two strains of Cyanothece sp. (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

3.1 Always the second: conservation and distinctive
properties of the N-ATPase

A search of the complete genome database identiﬁed homologous
N-ATPase operons in some representatives of the bacterial phyla
Aquiﬁcae, Chlorobi and Planctomycetes, in certain members of 01-,
5-, y- and 6-subdivisions of Proteobacteria, and in two archaea,
Methanosarcina barkeri and M.(1cetiv0r(1ns (see Supplementary
Fig. S2). All these operons had the same atpDCI-uer-athEFAG
gene order, encoding, respectively, 5-, 8-, 1-, Urf2-, a—, c-,
b-, 01- and y-subunits of this particular F-type ATPase, ﬁrst
described in M.b(1rkeri by Sumi et (11. (1997). The only exception
outside of cyanobacteria was Persephonella marina, a member
of the Aquiﬁcae, which has an N-ATPase operon with the 1102-
athEFAGDCI gene order and also harbors operons for F- and
A-type ATPases (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Identiﬁcation of the N-ATPase operons in diverse microorganisms
was simpliﬁed by the fact that these operons are always present in
the genomes as second copies alongside operons that encode typical
H+-transporting F-type ATPases (in M.b(1rkeri and M.(1cetiv0r(1ns,
A-type ATPases). In contrast, most N-ATPase c-subunits contain
ﬁill sets of Na+ ligands, indicating that these enzymes are speciﬁc
for Na+ ions. Just like the cyanobacterial Na+-binding c-subunits,
c-subunits of most N-ATPases had Glu residues in the middle of
both transmembrane helices (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The same subunits of the N-ATPases from diverse bacteria are
closely related and form distinct branches on the phylogenetic trees,
well separated from the equivalent subunits of the F- and V—type
ATPases (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3, see also Supplementary
Fig. 5 in Swingley et (11., 2008). Phylogenetic trees built for
individual N-ATPase subunits showed similar topologies, so that
the whole N-ATPase operons appeared to co-evolve (Supplementary
Fig. S4).

Another distinct trait of the N-ATPase operons was the presence
of an extra gene, 11er (Sumi et (11., 1997). Its product is currently
annotated as ‘Fl/FO ATPase, Methanosarcina type, subunit 2’
(F1F0_chp_2, TIGR03165, DH Haft, December 4, 2006) in the
JCVI’s Comprehensive Microbial Resource (Davidsen et (11., 2010)

and as ‘ATPase_F1/F0-cplx_su2_Meth-typ‘ (IPR017581) in the
InterPro database (Hunter et (11., 2009), whereas UniProt uniformly
annotates these proteins as ‘Putative uncharacterized protein’. The
11er (hereafter atpR) gene was found in every N-ATPase operon and
could be used as a tell-tale sign of these operons. Its product is a
hydrophobic protein with three predicted transmembrane segments,
two of which carry conserved Arg residues (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Presence of charged residues in the hydrophobic core of the
membrane is rare and usually indicative of a ﬁinctional role.

The N-ATPase operons also include so-called gene 1 (hereafter
(1th) that encodes another distinct membrane protein. Although
this gene was originally marked as (1th (Sumi et (11., 1997) and
is occasionally still labeled this way (Saum et (11., 2009), its
product shows no statistically signiﬁcant sequence similarity to the
genuine Ath (UncI) proteins, previously described in the genomes
of Escherichia coli and other model organisms. In accordance with
their distinct sequences, Ath and Ath proteins are assigned to two
different Pfam families, PF03899 and PF09527, respectively, and to
two different COGs, COG3312 and COG5536 in the CDD database
(Marchler-Bauer et (11., 2009). In contrast to alpR, the (1th gene is
not limited to the N-ATPase operons.

While the N-ATPase operon lacks the atpH gene that encodes the
6-subunit of the F-type ATPase, its (1th gene ((1th N) is unusually
long (Sumi et (11., 1997). We were able to align C-terminal regions
of the AthN and AtpH gene products (Supplementary Fig. S6).
This showed that N-ATPase contains at least part of the 6-subunit,
in agreement with the earlier analyses (Saum et (11., 2009).

3.2 Lateral transfer of N-ATPase genes

Presence of the N-ATPase operon in the genomes of M.b(1rkeri and
M.(1cetiv0r(1ns, but not in the closely related M.mazei, suggested
that this operon had been acquired via lateral gene transfer.
This suggestion is consistent with the gene neighborhoods of the
atpDCQRBEFG operons in M.b(1rkeri and M.(1cetiv0r(1ns (Fig. 2)
and the absence of these operons in any other archaeal genomes
sequenced so far. Gene neighborhoods of the N-ATPase operons in
various bacteria are also consistent with the insertion of this operon
(Supplementary Fig. S7). The widespread presence of the N-ATPase
genes among diverse bacteria deprecates the historical designation
of these enzymes as ‘archaebacterial FlFo-ATPases’. The strict
conservation of the gene order and co-linearity of the phylogenetic
trees for distinct N-ATPase subunits suggests that the whole operon
is being transferred as a single unit. However, the GC content of
the N-ATPase operons shows a good correlation with the average

either a relatively ancient gene transfer or a rapid adaptation of the
N-ATPase genes to their host environment. An additional indication
of the lateral mobility of the N-ATPase operon is its presence on
plasmids, pREB4 in A.m(1rin(1 and pAQ7 in Synechococcus sp. PCC
7002. These data might be related to the earlier ﬁinctional evidence
of the presence of two ion-translocating ATPases in M.mazei G61.
While the A-type ATP synthase was apparently H+-dependent, the
second, F-type ATPase appeared to be Na+-translocating (Becher
and Miiller, 1994; Pisa et (11., 2007). Although this second ATPase
has not been found in the sequenced genome ofM.m(1zei (Fig. 2), the
respective genes could be plasmid-bome, as is the case of N-ATPases
in at least two cyanobacteria.

4 DISCUSSION

Following the description of an ‘archaebacterial FlFo-ATPase’ in
M.b(1rkeri (Sumi et (11., 1997), the presence of a ‘Methanosarcina-
like’ F-ATPase operon was repeatedly noted in bacterial genomes
(Glockner et (11., 2003; McInerney et (11., 2007; Swingley et (11.,
2008), although the exact function(s) of these enzymes and their
cation speciﬁcity remained obscure. McInerney et (11. (2007)
noted two F-type ATPases encoded in the genome of Syntrophus
aciditrophicus and suggested that both of them were Na+-
translocating (incidentally, the F-type ATPase of this organism
is deﬁnitely H+-speciﬁc, whereas the cation speciﬁcity of its
N-ATPase is unknown; it might be speciﬁc for Na+, see below).
In their analysis of the A.m(1rin(1 genome, Swingley et (11. (2008)
noted the presence of a plasmid-encoded ‘set of ATP synthase genes
that were arranged into a unique operon  conserved with full
synteny in a remarkable array of organisms, including cyanobacteria,
archaea, planctomycetes, chlorobi and proteobacteria’. The authors
noted that the ai-subunits encoded in these operons clustered
together on a phylogenetic tree and suggested that these enzymes
formed a separate new family of ATP synthases. However, they
slightly overstated their case by claiming that its ‘individual
proteins do not clearly ﬁt into any of the described families’
(Swingley et (11., 2008). They also disputed the idea that these
enzymes were Na+-translocating. In addition, the key observation
by Daniel Haft that these enzymes always ‘represent a second
F1/F0 ATPase system’ has only been published online in the
JCVI’s Comprehensive Microbial Resource (Davidsen et (11., 2010).

As a result, there still exists a signiﬁcant confusion as to the
phylogenetic distribution, organization and the functional role(s) of
these enzymes.

The alignment in Supplementary Fig. S1 shows that, despite the
doubts of Swingley et (11. (2008), the c subunit of the A.m(1rin(1
N-ATPase has a ﬁill set of Na+-binding ligands, including the
recently recognized additional Thr residue of the ESTxxY motif
(Mulkidjanian et (11., 2008a; Meier et (11., 2009). While this residue
is missing in c-subunits of several N-ATPases, including the one
from S.(1ciditr0phicus, a Glu residue is present instead of the
Na+-coordinating Gln residue in the ﬁrst transmembrane helix of
the c subunit of nearly all N-ATPases (Supplementary Fig. S1).
As has been noted previously (Meier et (11., 2009; Saum et (11.,
2009), this Glu residue could potentially provide two ligands for
the Na+ ion and thereby complete the Na+ coordination shell. If
so, all these N-ATPases would end up being capable of binding
Na+ ions.

A hallka of the N-ATPase operons is the presence of the atpR
gene. Because of the low dielectric permittivity of the membrane, the
strategic positioning of two Arg residues of AtpR in the hydrophobic
core of the membrane (Supplementary Fig. S5) implies the presence
of negatively charged residues in their vicinity. Given the absence
in the N-ATPase operons of the (1th gene, whose product was
recently shown to interact with the c-ring (Suzuki et (11., 2007),
we suggest that the product of the AtpR gene serves essentially the
same function, regulating N-ATPase assembly and/or its activity.
Just like Ath assists c-ring assembly by directly interacting with
the c-subunits (Suzuki et (11., 2007), AtpR could do that through
the interaction of its two Arg residues with N-ATPase-speciﬁc c-
subunits, most of which carry two Glu residues in the middle of
their transmembrane helices (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The observation that N-ATPases are always found alongside
typical F- or A-type ATPases suggests that the N-ATPases cannot
functionally replace those enzymes in their role as ATP synthases.
Indeed, in M.(1cetiv0r(1ns, deletion of the N-ATPase operon had no
visible effect on cell growth or ATP synthesis, whereas a mutant
lacking the A-ATP synthase genes could not be obtained (Saum et (11.,
2009). We conclude that, similarly to the eukaryotic V—ATPases,
the N-ATPases do not catalyze ATP synthesis, which leaves ATP-
driven ion pumping as the most plausible ﬁinction for these enzymes.
By analogy with V—ATPases, the N-ATPase c-oligomer ring can
be expected to consist of a smaller number of c-subunits than the
c-oligomer ring of F-type ATP synthases.

Acquisition of an operon capable of extrusion of Na+ ions would
be beneﬁcial to the marine bacteria and other organisms living
in high-salt environments. Accordingly, many N-ATPase-encoding
bacteria are either marine organisms or grow in the presence of salt.
Since Na+-translocating ATPases can also translocate protons (von
Ballmoos et (11., 2008), the N-ATPases could in principle function as
outward proton pumps in low-sodium and/or acidic environments.
A typical N-ATPase operon (with untranslated AtpR) has been
found in an industrial strain of Pseudomonas veronii growing on
2-butanone (Onaca et (11., 2007). The presence of N-ATPase genes
in such pathogens as Burkholderia mallei appears to be inherited
from their free-living relatives and might be related to their survival
in blood.

Using a larger set of sequences than the one used by Swingley
et (11. (2008), we have conﬁrmed that N-ATPases branch separately
from other F-type ATPases (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S3).

This separate branching suggests a possible early divergence of
the N-ATPases, which is compatible with the following, supposedly
ancestral traits of these enzymes:

(i) Both AthN subunit of the N-ATPase and the E subunit of
the peripheral stalk of the V/A-type ATPases correspond to a
fusion of b- and 6-subunits of the typical F-ATPases (Pallen
et (11., 2006).

(ii) The presence of the second membrane-embedded Glu residue
is consistent with the evolution of the c-subunit from
a duplication of an arnphiphilic helix that contained a
Glu residue in the middle (Davis, 2002). Similar two-Glu
c-subunits are found in the A-type ATPases of methanogens
and F-type ATPases of Thermotogae.

(iii) Outward pumping of Na+ ions, the predicted ﬁinction of N-
ATPases, appears to be an ancient trait and has been previously
suggested as a function of the common ancestor of the F- and
V—type ATPases (Mulkidjanian et (11., 2007; 2008a, b; 2009).

All these features, which N-ATPases share either with V/A-
ATPases—to the exclusion of most F-ATPases—or with the
putative common ancestor of all rotary ATPases, suggest that
N-ATPases represent a distinct early-diverging family of rotary
ATPases. Thus, the Na-translocating common ancestor of all F-type
ATPases apparently gave rise to two different families of ATPases:
(i) the reversible ATPases/ATP synthases (‘ genuine’ F-ATPases) and
(ii) ATP-driven ion pumps (N-ATPases).

In conclusion, the N-ATPases (until now usually referred to
as ‘archaebacterial FlFo-ATPases’) are encoded in an apparently
highly mobile operon that, most likely, confers on its hosts the ability
of ATP-driven outward pumping of Na+ ions, which complements
the H+ speciﬁcity of the native chromosome-encoded F-ATPase (or
A-ATPase). We predict that, similarly to the eukaryotic V—ATPases,
the N-ATPases do not catalyze ATP synthesis, which is why an
N-ATPase is never found alone in a genome, only as the second
enzyme in cells that already encode an F-type or a A-type ATP
synthase. Accordingly, caution should be exercised when referring
to their components as subunits of the ATP synthase. We believe
that experimental veriﬁcation of the predicted functions of the
N-ATPases would be useful for the proper annotation of these
interesting enzymes and could also help in understanding the
evolution of energy conservation mechanisms.

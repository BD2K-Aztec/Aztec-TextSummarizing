ABSTRACT

Motivation: AGO(Argonaute)-binding domains, composed of
repeated motifs, in which only binary combinations of tryptophan
and glycine are conserved, bind AGO proteins and are essential
during RNAi-mediated gene silencing. The amino acid sequence
of this domain is extremely divergent and therefore very difficult
to detect. Commonly used bioinformatic tools fail to identify
tryptophan—glycine and/or glycine—tryptophan motifs (WG/GW)
domains and currently there is no publicly available software which
can detect these weakly conserved, but functional AGO-binding
segments.

Results: Recently, we have developed an algorithm based on
compositional analysis of the amino acid content of the domain.
We have demonstrated that the algorithm can be successfully
applied for the identification of the new WG/GW proteins in the
Arabidopsis genome. Here we introduce Agos (Argonaute-binding
domain screener), a novel universal web service for de novo
identification of WG/GW domains in protein sequences. The web
implementation of the algorithm contains several new features
and enhancements: (i) one universal scoring matrix which allows
identification of AGO-binding proteins in sequences representing all
organisms; (ii) reduction of false positive predictions by improved
selectivity of the algorithm; (iii) graphical interface to easily browse
the prediction results; and (iv) the option to submit a DNA sequence
which will be automatically translated in six frames before running
the prediction algorithm.

1 INTRODUCTION

The WG/GW domains recruit Argonaute (AGO) proteins to distinct
components of the eukaryotic RNA silencing pathways and are
strictly required for gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi). The
sequences of the domain are extremely divergent and are composed
of quasi-repeated regions containing conserved tryptophan—glycine
and/or glycine—tryptophan motifs (henceforth called WG/GW
motifs), which are essential for binding multiple molecules of
AGO proteins (El-Shami et al., 2007). The hypervariable sequences

of WG/GW domain are generally not alignable as positional
homology cannot be precisely determined. Consequently, all
commonly available bioinformatic tools (e.g. PSI-BLAST, HMMER
and Gibbs sampler) fail to identify the AGO-binding domains
in systematic analyses. There is presently no publicly available
software speciﬁcally designed for detection of these sequence-
divergent, but functionally conserved AGO-binding domains.

In a previous study (Karlowski et (11., 2010), we demonstrated
by an in silico domain-swapping simulation between plant and
mammalian WG/GW proteins that the amino acid composition of
the AGO-binding sites is conserved. We designed a computational
method for WG/GW domain detection based on the preferences of
certain amino acids found within the plant WG/GW domains. In our
screen we were able to identify all of the already Characterized AGO-
interacting proteins in plants (KTFl/SPTS, SPTS-like and NRPEl)
and mammals (GW182 family members) as well as several other
candidate WG/GW domain-containing proteins. The experimental
veriﬁcation of one of the proteins (a putative oxidoreductase),
conﬁrmed its AGO-binding capabilities. However, several proteins
identiﬁed during the screening of animal genomes represented false
predictions. These fragments represent low-complexity sequences
rich in amino acid located at the top of our scoring table. The
presence of such proteins which most likely have no AGO-binding
activity was probably the result of a limited capability of the original
plant scoring matrix to distinguish between the genuine WG/GW
proteins and other compositionally biased molecules.

We present Agos (Argonaute-binding domain screener), a new
web application for de novo identiﬁcation of WG/GW Argonaute-
binding domains in eukaryotic proteins. To overcome the restrictions
of the original method, during the development of Agos we
introduced several method improvements: (i) the initial sequence
dataset of both plant and animal, experimentally conﬁrmed,
AGO-binding proteins; (ii) a new scoring table for all 400
possible combinations of dipeptides (this step signiﬁcantly improved
speciﬁcity of WG/GW domain identiﬁcation and enhanced precise
the annotation of domain boundaries); and (iii) a scoring
matrix which now reﬂects compositional differences between the
domain and the whole corresponding proteome. In this way the
compositional signal of the domain is speciﬁcally ampliﬁed, leading
to precise detection of conserved features of the domain.

2 METHODS

The detailed methodology of AGO-binding domain identiﬁcation was
described recently (Karlowski at al.. 2010). The initial sequence dataset
was extended to cover a manually selected collection of plant and animal

WG/GW protein domains and their orthologs with experimentally conﬁrmed
biological function. The sequence collection included NRPEl (El-Shami
et al.. 2007). SPTS/KTFl (He et al.. 2009). SPTS-like (Bies-Etheve et al..
2009). WGRPl from Arabidopsis (Karlowski et al.. 2010). WAGl. cnjB
from Tetrahymena thermophila (Bednenko et al.. 2009). and GW182 from
ﬂy and GW182 family-related proteins from human and other mammalians
(Eulalio et al.. 2009).

The calculation of scoring tables (dos and ics; see Supplementary Material
for details) and selection corresponding threshold values were already
explained in the previous study. Dos scoring matrix was calculated based
on the frequency distribution of all 400 combinations of dipeptides present
in the initial dataset of WG/GW domains and corresponding proteomes. The
ics scoring table represents the properties of the group of domains selected as
the initial dataset for this analysis. In contrast to the dos score. where higher
values represent better candidates. values tending towards zero represent a
closer compositional relationship with the reference dataset.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Design and implementation

The computational engine of Agos was developed in Python and
the web interface is implemented in Django. The tool is designed
to accept one single protein or DNA sequence in FASTA format
at a time. The DNA sequence is translated in all six reading
frames before applying the domain detection algorithm. The query
protein sequence must contain at least one WG or GW motif to
be ﬁirther processed. The data are posted to a WG/GW protein
identiﬁcation pipeline to screen for all regions containing WG/GW
domains. The availability of two scoring systems, dos and ics (see
Section 2) provides a measurement of the degree of compositional
compatibility of the new domains with the already-conﬁrmed
AGO-binding proteins. Program output can either be displayed
in the web browser window (interactive mode) or saved to a
ﬁle (text/plain output). The interactive output mode uses standard
DHTML (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and no additional plugins
are required.

3.2 Output of WG/GW domain identiﬁcation results

The output report is divided into three separate ﬁelds: ‘Data info’,
‘WG/GW domains’ and ‘Sequence’ (Fig. l).

The ‘Data info’ ﬁeld provides basic information about the query
sequence (id, description, length and number of WG/GW motifs),
as well as a graphical view of the protein with marked positions for
all detected potential WG/GW regions. The quality of GW domain
predictions are color coded. Green blocks indicate domains that
passed statistical threshold values (dos and ics). Yellow blocks label
sequence regions that passed only dos score threshold. Red blocks
correspond to regions having very low-compositional compatibility
to the GW AGO-binding domain.

The ‘WG/GW domains’ ﬁeld provides more detailed, textual
information in the form of a table listing all the predicted domains
sorted according to the start position in the protein. For each domain,
the index number, the start and stop positions in the query sequence,
the length of the domain, the number of WG/GW motifs, dos score,
P-value and ics score are shown.

The HTML results view provides additional interactive WG/GW
domain match viewer and feature highlighting. Moving the cursor
over a match block (with JavaScript option enabled) in the graphical
protein view will highlight its position in the full-length protein
sequence as well as the corresponding row in the ‘WG/GW domains’
table. Highlighted regions are preserved as long as the user does not
move the cursor over another block. The plain text output provides
no web links, but is optimal for copy/pasting and corresponds to the
‘WG/GW domains’ ﬁeld where values are tab separated.

The ‘Sequence’ section displays the ﬁill-length query sequence.

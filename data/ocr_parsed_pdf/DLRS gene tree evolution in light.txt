ABSTRACT

Summary: PrIME-DLRS (or colloquially: ‘Delirious’) is a phylogenetic
software tool to simultaneously infer and reconcile a gene tree given a
species tree. It accounts for duplication and loss events, a relaxed
molecular clock and is intended for the study of homologous gene
families, for example in a comparative genomics setting involving mul-
tiple species. PrIME-DLRS uses a Bayesian MCMC framework, where
the input is a known species tree with divergence times and a multiple
sequence alignment, and the output is a posterior distribution over
gene trees and model parameters.

Availability and implementation: PrIME-DLRS is available for Java
SE 6+ under the New BSD License, and JAR files and source code
can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p4prime/. There is
also a slightly older C++ version available as a binary package for
Ubuntu, with download instructions at http://prime.sbc.su.se. The
C++ source code is available upon request.

Supplementary Information: PrIME-DLRS is based on a sound prob-
abilistic model (Akerborg et al., 2009) and has been thoroughly vali-
dated on synthetic and biological datasets (Supplementary Material
online).

1 INTRODUCTION

The surge in Bayesian phylogenetic methods over the last decade
can be attributed to their ability to achieve more realistic models
as well as a solid track record for resolving outstanding biolo-
gical issues (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001). Recently, the interplay
between gene family evolution and species phylogenies has
gained particular attention, partly owing to the information
that gene trees may confer on unresolved species relationships
and also because it can shed light on orthology and paralogy of
genes. With sophisticated conventional phylogenetic models bur-
geoning, it is therefore not surprising that there is a growing
interest to extend them to a setting entailing both gene trees
and species trees.

2 MODEL

In Arvestad et a]. (2009), we presented a probabilistic model for
gene family evolution. This work was extended in Akerborg et a].
(2009) to create the model DLRS (formerly GSR), in which the
evolutionary process inheritantly relies on a species tree while
allowing for a relaxed molecular clock. The acronym captures
the key concepts underlying the model:

Duplication events.
0 Loss events.
0 Rate heterogeneity.

0 Sequence evolution.

Figure 1D illustrates the model: starting with a single lineage
at the most ancient point in the species tree, a gene family evolves
down by means of duplication, loss and speciation events.
Duplications and losses are governed by duplication rate 8 and
loss rate Miakin to a birthideath processiwhereas lineages
branch deterministically at speciations. Lineages that fail to
reach the leaves of the species tree are pruned away.
Consequently, the model properly accounts for species evolution
to guide a gene family’s evolution in a way that, for instance, a
Yule process or a uniform distribution for gene tree divergence
times do not. The resulting clock-like gene tree is then relaxed by
applying iid rates on each branch in order to generate non-clock-
like branch lengths on which a substitution model of choice acts
to produce family sequences.

3 FEATURES

To accompany the DLRS model, we have developed the
PrIME-DLRS software package as a part of the PrIME suite
of phylogenetics tools (http://prime.sbc.su.se). PrIME-DLRS
uses a Bayesian MCMC framework t%given a species tree
S with divergence times t and a multiple sequence alignment
Dﬂample from the posterior distribution of gene trees G,
branch lengths I and model parameters 6 (encompassing 8, [1,
etc.). Using the MetropolisiHastings algorithm and the
factorization,

it sufﬁces to compute the right-hand side numerator. P[D|G,l]
can be computed with Felsenstein’s pruning algorithm
(Felsenstein, 1981), whereas PrIME-DLRS uses a dynamic

programming approach on a discretization of S to calculate
p[G, ll6, S, t], and uniform priors are employed for p[6]. It
should be noted that this approach avoids potential perils asso-
ciated with including divergence times and substitution rates in
the state space, instead of algorithmically integrating these into
the branch lengths I.

PrIME-DLRS provides a variety of user options, including
some popular predeﬁned substitution models (e.g. Jones et al.,
1992; Jukes and Cantor, 1969) as well as allowing for
user-deﬁned ﬁxed-parameter substitution models for nucleotide,
protein and codon data. A gamma distribution is currently used
for the iid edge rates. The implementation also supports model-
ling rate variation over sites using discrete gamma rate categories
Wang, 1994). Output consists of a tab-delimited file of samples
from the posterior and can be analysed in any suitable tool, e. g.
the coda package for CRAN R (Plummer et al., 2006).
PrIME-DLRS has been implemented in Java and C++.
Compared to the original version published with Akerborg
et a]. (2009), the newer versions are more robust and typically
#20 times quicker (see further Supplementary Material).

4 CONCLUSION

By incorporating information on the species tree, PrIME-DLRS
significantly improves on conventional species tree unaware

approaches when inferring gene trees (Rasmussen and Kellis,
2010). In Akerborg et a]. (2009), the method was shown to be
self-consistent on artiﬁcial data generated in accordance with the
model. In the same article, the significance of species tree guid-
ance and a relaxed molecular clock was demonstrated on biolo-
gical data utilizing a predicted whole-genome duplication in
yeast. These ﬁndings have been further corroborated by the abil-
ity to classify syntenic one-to-one orthologs in Drosophila
(Supplementary Material). Unlike certain similar approaches
that take the species tree into consideration (e.g. Rasmussen
and Kellis, 2010), PrIME-DLRS requires no a priori derivation
of clock relaxation parameters and can be run on individual gene
families. Moreover, as demonstrated in the Supplementary
Material, by inferring 8 and it, the model can provide estimates
of genome-wide evolutionary duplication and loss rates.

The Bayesian property of yielding a posterior distribution not
only implicitly brings forth a conﬁdence measure on gene trees
but also provides an important step toward probabilistic orthol-
ogy analysis when considering the reconciliation of the gene trees
with the species tree (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Material).

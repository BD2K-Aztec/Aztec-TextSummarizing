Abstract

Motivation: The binding between a peptide and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one
of the most important processes for the induction of an adaptive immune response. Many algo—
rithms have been developed to predict peptide/MHC (pMHC) binding. However, no approach has
yet been able to give structural insight into how peptides detach from the MHC.

Results: In this study, we used a combination of coarse graining, hierarchical natural move Monte
Carlo and stochastic conformational optimization to explore the detachment processes of 32
different peptides from HLA—A*02:01. We performed 100 independent repeats of each stochastic
simulation and found that the presence of experimentally known anchor amino acids affects the
detachment trajectories of our peptides. Comparison with experimental binding affinity data indi—
cates the reliability of our approach (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.85).
We also compared to a 1000 ns molecular dynamics simulation of a non—binding peptide
(AAAKTPVIV) and HLA—A*02:01. Even in this simulation, the longest published for pMHC, the pep—
tide does not fully detach. Our approach is orders of magnitude faster and as such allows us to ex—
plore pMHC detachment processes in a way not possible with all—atom molecular dynamics
simulations.

1 Introduction

 

Presentation of protein fragments on the surface of antigen—
presenting cells is a fundamental part of the human immune sys—
tem. In virus—infected cells, proteosomes degrade viral proteins
into peptides. These peptides are then transported via the trans—
porter associated with antigen processing into the lumen of the
endoplasmic reticulum where the peptides are loaded on major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. These pep—
tide/MHC (pMHC) complexes are then presented on the surface of
antigen—presenting cells to the T—cell receptors (TCR) of T cells
(Rudolph et (11., 2006). The linkage between MHC, peptide and

TCR determines if an immune reaction is triggered against this
peptide (van der Merwe and Dushek, 2011). Only if the binding af—
finity between peptide and MHC is strong enough, a peptide can
be presented to TCR and a productive immune response against
this peptide can take place. A wide range of pMHC binding affin—
ity prediction methods have been developed (reviewed in Knapp
et (11., 2009; Zhang et (11., 2012b). Sequence—based methods usually
achieve high accuracy if sufficient training data are available.
Structure—based methods are often worse at predicting binding af—
finity but give insight into the binding mode of the peptide (com—
pare Knapp et (11., 2009; Zhang et (11., 2012b). Prediction methods

based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation attempt to not only
predict the binding affinity and binding mode but also the dy—
namics of a peptide bound inside the MHC binding groove (Knapp
et 41]., 2015). However, no all—atom MD simulation has so far been
able to give insight into the structural detachment process of a pep—
tide from an MHC. This is likely to be due to the immense resource
consumption that standard MD would take to map out the con—
formational space of pMHC detachment.

There are a large number of methods that have the potential to
enhance sampling of structural simulations over standard MD.
These include coarse graining at different levels [e.g. bond length
constraints (Mazur, 1998), increased masses (Feenstra et 41]., 1999),
virtual sites (Hess et 41]., 2008), n—bead models (Minary and Levitt,
2008) or the movement of rigid protein segments (Sim et 41]., 2012)],
biased force methods [e.g. metadynamics (Leone et 41]., 2010),
steered MD (Bayas et 41]., 2003; Cuendet et 41]., 2011; Kosztin et 41].,
1999) or umbrella sampling (Torrie and Valleau, 1977)], replica ex—
change MD (Bernardi et 41]., 2015), Monte Carlo simulations or
alchemistic methods (Spiwok et 41]., 2014). While these methods
have been employed successfully for several ligand/receptor inter—
actions, they have so far not been used to study pMHC detachment.
Therefore, to date, neither experiments nor simulations have pro—
vided structural information on potential peptide detachment path—
ways from MHC.

In this study, we gain structural insight into the process of pep—
tide detachment from the MHC HLA—A"'02:01 by identifying a
large number of low energy conformational states along the de—
tachment pathway. Instead of all—atom MD, we use a simplified
protein representation combined with generalized collective de—
grees of freedom and repeated simulated annealing. These three
steps use already established methods: First, we coarse grain our
all—atom model by using a 3—point—based amino acid representation
(Minary and Levitt, 2008) and a knowledge—based statistical po—
tential (Minary and Levitt, 2008). Second, we use hierarchical nat—
ural move Monte Carlo (HNMMC) (Sim et 41]., 2012) to control
the degrees of freedom. Third, we use temperature modulation
(Zhang et 41]., 2012a) to efficiently sample the energy landscape.
On the basis of this protocol, we are for the first time able to give a
comprehensive structural insight into the detachment processes of
peptides from MHCs.

2 Methods

All—atom MD simulations are often hampered by two obstacles: the
large number of degrees of freedom and the complexity of the en—
ergy function. In this study, we address these challenges by the com—
bination of coarse graining, HNMMC and temperature annealing
accelerated conformational optimization.

2.1 Coarse—grained protein model and force field

The all—atom pMHC structures were converted into 3—point repre—
sentations (Minary and Levitt, 2008) using gro2mat (Dien et 41].,
2014). In this representation, an amino acid is modelled by the or—
carbon and carbonyl oxygen backbone atoms as well as a point at
the centre of the side chain.

The previously established (Minary and Levitt, 2008) 3—point
knowledge—based potential was used for the simulations. A coar—
se—grained potential can in principal allow atoms to approach
closer than the excluded volume. To ensure that our small peptides
did not approach the protein surface too closely, we uniformly

scaled all pair interaction energies by the continuous non—linear
function:

6
50+(1—so)(%) ifr<ro

1.0 ifrZro

W) I

Where r0 : 0.7 nm represents approximately the size of a large
amino acid and So : 0.15 was chosen, so that all peptides can escape
deep energy minima. All pair interactions over 0.7 nm are identical
to the established knowledge—based potential (Minary and Levitt,
2008).

2.2 Hierarchical natural move Monte Carlo

We follow the previously described HNMMC methodology (Sim
et 41]., 2012), which has been used in combination with the above
coarse—grained model (Zhang et 41]., 2012a) and is implemented in
the software package MOSAICS. Natural moves are degrees of
freedom that describe the collective motion of groups of residues
(called regions). In proteins, this could be the movement of a stable
secondary structure element such as an or—helix or B—sheet. Regions
can additionally be grouped together and thereby form super—
regions. In our study, we grouped the MHC into seven regions
(Fig. 1; schematically in Supplementary Appendix Fig. S1). Both
helices can move independently from the rest of the MHC and are
ﬂexible in themselves around the evolutionary conserved kinks
(Wilman et 41]., 2014) position in the middle of the helices. Also the
peptide can be moved as a whole as well as in sub—regions. This de—
composition enables all essential motions of the pMHC while
keeping the number of degrees of freedom to a (necessary) min—
imum. In our Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation,
each region as well as super—region (e.g. the two regions of one
MHC helix) is propagated independently along three translational
and three rotational degrees of freedom. The resulting chain breaks
are resolved by an efficient stochastic chain—closure algorithm
(Minary and Levitt, 2010).

2.3 Temperature modulation

In structural simulations, higher temperature allows for more ﬂexibility,
while a lower temperature hampers ﬂexibility. In this study, we used re—
peated simulated annealing, which allows the rapid search for an en—
semble of energetically favourable structural states along the peptide
detachment process. It has been implemented by using a temperature
modulation protocol (Zhang et (11., 2012a) as described by the function

Tsz-sin(%) +5+A

Where A is the amplitude of the temperature modulation, [2 the
MCMC step counter, Q is the number of steps per period and s is
used to shift the minimum temperature. Similar to previous applica—
tions (Zhang et (11., 2012a), this conformational optimization proto—
col enabled the efficient exploration of important energy minima
and corresponding pMHC conformations. In this study, we used
A : 600 (Kelvin), k : 100 000, Q : 5000 and s : 0 (Kelvin).

2.4 Preparation of the pMHC dataset
We used the MHC allele HLA—A"'02:01 as it is among the most fre—
quent MHC alleles in humans. To ensure that we did not use an out—
lier HLA—A” 02:01 structure for our study, we extracted the 10
X—ray structures of HLA—A"'02:01 with the highest resolutions from
the protein data bank (PDB) (Berman et (11., 2000) and validated
their amino acid sequence against the IMGT/HLA database
(Robinson et (11., 2013). We then selected PDB—accession code
3PWN as it represents an average HLA—A "' 02:01 structure.
Thirty—two peptides with experimentally determined binding affin—
ities were selected from Ishizuka et al. (2009) (Supplementary
Appendix Table SI). We chose all peptides from the same study as this
makes it likely that the measurements are comparable in rank order.
These peptides were chosen to cover the whole range of observed ex—
perimental binding affinities. We chose a dataset with experimental
IC50 values as those are available in abundance [e.g. from the
Immune Epitope Data Base (IEDB) (Vita et (11., 2010)] and therefore
used for benchmarking most pMHC binding affinity predictors.
SCWRL (Krivov et (11., 2009) and the peth (Knapp et (11.,
2011b) framework were used to model the 32 peptides of Ishizuka
et al. (2009) into the MHC binding groove of PDB accession code
3PWN. This has been shown to be the most appropriate approach
for altered pMHC modelling (Knapp et (11., 2008).

2.5 Performed simulations

Initial test HNMMC simulations were run for 500 000 steps. These
simulations showed that detachment usually takes place within
100 000 MCMC steps (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we ran the simulations
of all 32 modelled pMHC complexes for 100 000 steps using the
above—described HNMMC protocol. We repeated each simulation
100 times using different random seeds.

For comparison, we performed a 1000—ns standard MD simula—
tion [GROMACS 4.5 (Pronk et (11., 2013) with the GROMOS96
5 3a6 force field (Oostenbrink et (11., 2004) and explicit simple point
charge (SPC) water] of the same pMHC.

3 Results

3.1 HNMMC gives insights into the peptide

detachment processes

In Figure 2A, we show a representative detachment process of the
experimentally known non—binding peptide AAAKTPVIV. Using

our HNMMC protocol, important conformational states for the
partial peptide detachment process of this peptide can be located
within 25 000 steps. These states imply that this peptide starts to de—
tach C—terminally. All relevant conformational states for the full de—
tachment are detected after 100 000 steps (arrow in Fig. 2A). This
corresponds to approximately 2.5 h of simulation time on a standard
desktop machine (all 500 000 steps took about 13 h).

For comparison, we performed a 1000—ns MD simulation of
the same pMHC (Fig. 2B). To date, this is the longest
reported MD simulation of pMHC and took about 247h using
128 cores. The runtime of this single MD simulation corresponds
roughly to the overall runtime of all (n : 3200) HNMMC simula—
tions (100 independent simulations for 32 different peptide se—
quences) of this project (Fig. 2C). There is a high degree of
similarity between the first 25 000 frames of the HNMMC detach—
ment process and the MD simulation (compare Fig. 2A and B).
Both simulations start their detachment process by an up and
down ﬂapping of peptide’s C—terminal end. However, during
1000 ns of MD, only this partial detachment can be observed
(Fig. 2B). Thus, our HNMMC—based protocol is capable of accel—
erating calculations for pMHC detachment processes by several
orders of magnitude.

3.2 Putative peptide detachment pathways

Having demonstrated that the methodology is able to simulate pep—
tide detachment and that the results show agreement with classical
methods, we then simulated 32 different peptides and repeated each
simulation 100 times with different random initial seeds to initiate
stochastically different trajectories.

The average peptide detachment pathway, grouped by experi—
mentally known binder and non—binder, is illustrated in Figure 3A.
X—ray structures show that peptides bind in the MHC groove in a
slightly bent configuration. This allows for a closer proximity be—
tween the peptide ends and the MHC binding groove than between
the peptide middle and the MHC binding groove. All 32 peptides
have an initial distance between peptide and MHC ﬂoor of 1.31 nm
for the peptide middle (CocSpeptide to Coc28MHC) and 1.08 nm and
1.09 nm for the peptide N— and C—terminal ends (Coc1peptide
to Coc99MHC and Coc9peptide to Coc117MHC, respectively)
(Fig. 3A). The peptides do not start their detachment process from

the middle but from the N— or C—terminal end or from all peptide
positions at the same time (Fig. 3B). After only 20 000 steps, the
middle distance tends to have become the shortest distance. The pep—
tides generally do not show a preference for an N— or C—terminal
start of the detachment process from HLA—A"'02:01 (Fig. 3A), but
individual peptides do have preferences for N— or C—terminal detach—
ment (Fig. 3C—E and Supplementary Appendix Fig. S2).

Two mechanisms, which we never observed, are detachments
starting from the peptide middle by either bending the ends inwards
or bending the ends outwards (Fig. 3B, lowest panel).

3.3 The relationship between MHC anchor residues and
peptide detachment pathways

The idea that certain residues are more important than others for
MHC binding is called the anchor residue concept (Rammensee
et (11., 1999). We investigated the relation between known anchor
residues and the detachment pathways of our peptides. We extracted
all experimentally tested HLA—A"'02:01 peptides from the IEDB. In
Supplementary Appendix Figure 4, we show the frequency of resi—
dues for binders and non—binders. This shows that binders have a
preference for the hydrophobic residues L, M or I at peptide position
2 and V, L or I at peptide position nine. These residues are in

ROC curve. (B) Boxplots of the average distance between MHC binding floor
and the peptide for all simulations split by experimentally known binders and
non-binders

agreement with the preferred anchors listed in the SYFPEITHI data—
base (Rammensee et (11., 1999).

The presence or absence of these residues inﬂuences the detach—
ment trajectories of the peptides. For example, the experimentally
known binder FLIDLAFLI has anchor residue L at position 2 and
anchor residue I at position 9 which keeps the peptide stable in the
MHC binding groove for almost all replicas (Fig. 3C). The experi—
mentally known non—binder WIKTISKRM has an anchor at peptide
position 2 (I) but does not have an anchor residue in position nine.
Therefore, its detachment process frequently starts C—terminally
with the N—terminal end following later and more slowly (Fig. 3D).
The experimentally known non—binder RQQLEDIFM does not have
any matching anchor residues. It starts it detachment process simul—
taneously from both ends and the middle of the peptide (Fig. 3E).

This shows that anchor amino acids have a strong inﬂuence on
the detachment trajectories of peptides.

3.4 Experimental binding affinity and peptide
detachment

The accuracy of our HNMMC approach in discriminating between
experimentally known MHC binders and non—binders gives an indi—
cation of the reliability of our proposed detachment trajectories.
Non—binders should have larger distances to the MHC binding
groove than binders i.e. they are likely to detach more quickly. We
tested this by comparing the average distance over all replicas of a
peptide against its experimentally known binding affinity. This test
yields an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AROC) of 0.85 (Fig. 4A) and Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.67 (Supplementary Appendix Fig. S4). Furthermore, the difference
between the pMHC—distances of all binders and all non—binders is
significant (Fig. 4B).

Single simulations might be misleading because the conform—
ational exploration could be trapped in one or few local minima.
The use of multiple replica simulations is usually more reliable. To
test whether this is the case for our pMHC detachment simulations,
we performed a boot—strapping analysis using the 100 replicas per
peptide. We investigated how the results would change if fewer rep—
licas are taken into account. We randomly chose 7; (taking the values
1 to 100) replicas out of our 100 replicas with repetition. We calcu—
lated the AROC against experimental data. We repeated this 5 000
times for each n and calculated the standard deviation between the
5 000 AROC values. Each point in Figure 5A is the standard devi—
ation over the 5 000 AROC values. If only one replica is used, the
standard deviation is 0.08 and the AROCs stretch between 0.53
(close to complete randomness) and 0.91 (close to perfect

The standard deviation of this distribution is shown as the first red dot of (A).
(C) The same as (B) but for 100 replicas chosen randomly 5000 times with

agreement). For 100 replicas, the standard deviation drops to
0.01 and the AROC values range only from 0.81 to 0.89 (Fig. 5B).
Figure 5A shows a sharp descent of the AROC standard deviations
until 25 replicas and a slower descent until 50 replicas.

This shows that our HNMMC approach can predict pMHC de—
tachment processes with high accuracy and reliability if at least 25,
if not 50, replicas are used.

4 Discussion

A large number of MD studies have investigated the structural
interaction between peptide and MHC (reviewed in Knapp et (11.,
2015). In none of these studies has full detachment of the peptide
been observed. The longest reported pMHC MD simulation was
400 ns by (Narzi et (11., 2012). In this study, we ran a 1000—ns
simulation of an experimentally known non—binding peptide in
complex with MHC and observed only partial peptide detachment.
This shows that current standard MD simulations are not giving
insight into the pMHC detachment processes within a reasonable
time frame. Consequently, most structural analysis has been car—
ried out on bound pMHC (Hischenhuber et (11., 2012, 2013) and
TCR/pMHC structures (Dunbar et (11., 2014; Knapp et (11., 2014)
or empty MHC binding grooves (Rupp et (11., 2011; Yaneva et (11.,
2009).

To obtain insight into the peptide detachment processes, we used
the combination of three technologies. First, the coarse—grained
3—point model (Minary and Levitt, 2008) which allowed for a rea—
sonable runtime while keeping specific features of the amino acid
side chains. Second, hierarchical segmentation (Sim et (11., 2012) of
the protein which further restricted the degrees of freedom and pre—
vented global denaturation or local spoiling at high amplitudes.

Third, repeated simulated annealing (Zhang et (11., 2012a) which
allowed for an efficient sampling of low energy states along the en—
ergy surface. In this way, we were able to bypass the bottleneck of
computational power and show how a detachment process of a pep—
tide from MHC may occur.

There are alternative techniques to our ‘coarse grained hierarch—
ical Monte Carlo simulated annealing approach’ that could also en—
hance the sampling (see introduction). However, to our knowledge,
none of these methods have been employed for pMHC detachment
yet.

Structural sampling methods will always produce a diverse col—
lection of conformations of the structure under investigation. These
movements are based on several parameter choices in the simulation
setup. How meaningful these conformations are can be determined
by comparison to experiments. Therefore, we compared our detach—
ment data to two different types of experimental data.

First, we compared the detachment process with preferred an—
chor amino acids deduced from the IEDB (Zhang et (11., 2008).
While anchor residues are not exclusively responsible for pMHC
binding, we found frequent agreement between an N— or C—terminal
detachment and the presence/absence of preferred anchor residues
(Fig. 3C—E).

Second, we investigated if our detachment trajectories can dis—
criminate between experimentally known binders and non—binders.
We achieved high agreement (Fig. 4) between predicted detachment
speed and experimental binding affinity data of (Ishizuka et (11.,
2009). An AROC of 0.85 of our training—free approach is roughly in
the range of sequence—trained pMHC binding prediction methods
(Zhang et (11., 2012b) and superior to structural ligand/protein dock—
ing methods applied to pMHC (Knapp et (11., 2009).

These findings demonstrate that our coarse—grained HNMMC
pMHC model is biophysically accurate and can capture the main
factors contributing to the outcome of binding.

Even if methods such as temperature modulation (Zhang et (11.,
2012a) or HNMMC (Sim et (11., 2012) are used, there is a finite
probability that simulations will get trapped in local minima or run
outlier trajectories leading to a questionable convergence (Knapp
et (11., 2011a). Therefore, we decided to run a total of 100 replica
simulations with different initial seeds per pMHC. On the basis of a
boot strapping analysis, we found that about 25—50 replicas are
needed for reliable conclusions. This is in agreement with recent
studies that showed that the comparison between few MD simula—
tions can yield to misleading results (Knapp et (11., 2014) and that 50
replicas are necessary for reliable binding free energy prediction of
HIV drugs to HIV—1 Protease (Wright et (11., 2014) and peptides to
MHC (Wan et (11., 2015).

5 Conclusion

In this study, we showed that HNMMC is able to give insight into
the peptide detachment process from MHC. For the first time, we
were able to analyse peptide detachment trajectories and thereby
provide new views of the MHC structural landscape.

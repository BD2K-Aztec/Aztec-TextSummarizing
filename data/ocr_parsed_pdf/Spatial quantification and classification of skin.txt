ABSTRACT

Motivation: For a mechanistic understanding of skin and its
response to an induced perturbation, systems biology is gaining
increasing attention. Unfortunately, quantitative and spatial exp-
ression data for skin, like for most other tissues, are almost not
available.

Results: Integrating organotypic skin cultures, whole-slide scanning
and subsequent image processing provides bioinformatics with
a novel source of spatial expression data. We here used this
approach to quantitatively describe the effect of treating organotypic
skin cultures with sodium dodecyl sulphate in a non-corrosive
concentration. We first measured the differentiation-related spatial
expression gradient of Heat-Shock-Protein 27 in a time series of up
to 24 h. Secondly, a multi-dimensional tissue classifier for predicting
skin irritation was developed based on abstract features of these
profiles. We obtained a high specificity of 0.94 and a sensitivity of
0.92 compared with manual classification. Our results demonstrate
that the integration of tissue cultures, whole-slide scanning and
image processing is well suited for both the standardized data
acquisition for systems biological tissue models and a highly robust
classification of tissue responses.

1 INTRODUCTION

The human body is shielded against outside inﬂuences by the skin,
exhibiting a carefully regulated equilibrium of cell proliferation,
differentiation and cell death. Even though this homeostasis
guarantees a monthly self renewal, the exposition to harmful
substances can lead to severe perturbations of the skin (Perry and
Trafeli, 2009; Schnuch, 2007; Slodownik et al., 2008). The skin
therefore is a main target in toxicity testing and drug development.
Systems biology is gaining increasing attention in these areas
(Andersen and Krewski, 2009; Ho and Lieu, 2008; Krewski et al.,
2009), offering a novel approach to cope with the complexity
of the skin as a biological system (Grabe and Neuber, 2005).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Besides mimicking the physiologic system’s processes, the potential
of respective computational models lies in the prediction of skin
response following e.g. a chemical exposure.

For identifying those system elements and pathways mainly
contributing to the observed system response, a standardized
experimental setup is necessary. On the single cell level high
content screening (HCS) based on cell lines or strains allows
the quantiﬁcation of phenotypic changes after perturbation by
automated ﬂuorescence microscopy and subsequent image analysis
(Giuliano et al., 1997; Thomas, 2010). However, approaches
addressing individual cells do not reﬂect the spatial complexity of the
human skin with its stratiﬁed organization. For example, substances
applied to the surface of normal skin have to pass the barrier built
by the stratum comeum and the perturbation induced is buffered by
robust homeostatic molecular networks leading to differentiation-
dependent expression changes. Therefore, predictions based on these
simple single cell model assumptions are not necessarily transferable
to human skin. According to our best knowledge, up to now there
is no suitable data acquisition method for the standardized and
automated study of spatial skin response after perturbation.

Recently, automated whole slide scanners (Virtual Microscopy)
became available, offering the opportunity to analyze whole tissue
sections in high throughput. Thus, the combination of whole slide
scanners with industrially standardized tissue cultures could open
up a novel way for the systematic characterization of perturbations
induced to the human skin.

Industrially manufactured organotypic skin cultures offer a well
organized, reproducible spatial morphology and could therefore
serve as a standardized source for spatial organized data. Such ﬁill
thickness models are composed of epidermal keratinocytes growing
air exposed on a matrix of native collagen type I containing viable
ﬁbroblasts (Bell et al., 1981). A perturbation inﬂicted upon such
a skin tissue culture will, depending on its strength, alter tissue
homeostasis hallmarked by a speciﬁc spatial gene- and protein-
expression. We have shown previously how such differentiation-
dependent protein expression can be measured by quantitative
spatial proﬁles (QSPs) based on automated image analysis of native
skin sections, stained by indirect immunoﬂuorescence (Grabe et al.,
2007; Pommerencke et al., 2007).

We therefore set out to develop a novel data generation
pipeline for systems biology experiments comprised of perturbing
a standardized skin tissue culture, histological sectioning,
immunoﬂuorescence staining, whole slide scanning and automated

image analysis. We consider this approach to open up the possibility
for a standardized data acquisition of expression pattern changes
reﬂecting skin response after perturbation, thus being well qualiﬁed
for the toxicological study and characterization of chemicals.
We assessed the feasibility of the proposed system by disturbing
tissue homeostasis of skin cultures through the treatment with the
detergent and classical irritant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and
measuring the induced change as an altered Heat-Shock-Protein
HSP27 expression (Boxman et al., 2002) deploying quantitative
spatial proﬁling. To evaluate the reproducibility and suitability of
the quantiﬁed tissue response for testing skin irritation, we built
a classiﬁer distinguishing between irritated and non-irritated skin
samples.

2 METHODS

2.1 Experimental setup

MatTek EpiDermFTTM skin cultures were either treated with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) or 0.4% SDS for varying durations of 1, 6, 16 and 24 h
or received no treatment. In case of PBS and SDS, 25 ul of the respective
solution were applied on a mesh on top of the cultures. Thereafter, the cultures
were cryo conserved and cut into sections of 6 pm. Each mode of treatment
(e.g. 16h SDS) was applied to four cultures and for each culture about ﬁve
sections underwent an immunhistological ﬂuorescence triple staining. For the
subsequent automatic segmentation of the epithelium, a reference staining is
required delineating the epithelial area while omitting the stratum corneum
and which is stable against SDS. A staining that proved to be appropriate (at
least for a good approximation of the epithelium) comprised a blue nuclear
stain using the dye 4’ ,6-Diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI). Labeling the basal
lamina was performed with an antibody against the membrane protein
Laminin 5 labeled with Alexa 488. Additionally, the biomarker for the
quantiﬁcation of skin irritation (i.e. Hsp 27) was marked in red (Alexa 594).

2.2 Image acquisition

The ﬂuorescence sections were imaged with the Nanozoomer HT from
Hamamatsu Photonics capable of scanning whole slides. The slides were
scanned at 20>< magniﬁcation (with a resolution of 0.46 rim/pixel) in three
z-layers with a spacing of 2 pm each. In the resulting ‘virtual slide” those
tissue regions to be analyzed were selected in a computer-assisted way. For
each region automatically the best focused z-layer was determined and saved
as an image to be available for the following segmentation and proﬁling
algorithms.

2.3 Segmentation of the epithelium

Without a staining marking the whole epithelium, the epithelial area had to
be approximated using the staining of the basal lamina and the cell nuclei.
Therefore, the ﬁrst step was the segmentation of the basal lamina, scanned in
the green channel. After contrast enhancement and noise reduction mainly
a thresholding based on the Otsu’s method (Otsu, 1979) was applied. To
exclude unspeciﬁc and diffuse staining observed in the stratum granulosum
and corneum from the determined mask, the thresholding is combined with
an edge detection based on the Canny method (Canny, 1986). The operator
was parameterized to detect long stretched edges like the basal lamina.

In a second step, cell nuclei were detected in the blue image channel based
on a stepwise thresholding method to account for strongly as well as weakly
stained nuclei. Only image regions close to strong intensity gradients were
considered. Nuclei clusters were identiﬁed by size and split using a watershed
method (Meyer, 1994) with local maxima as seeds. Finally, false positive
detected cell nuclei were ﬁltered out based on the object features size,
roundness, inner intensity variation and contrast (Pommerencke at al., 2009).

Fig. 1. Protein expression proﬁling on ﬂuorescent images. Fluorescent
images from different tissue samples or locations are automatically
segmented based on nuclei and basal lamina information. The determined
epithelial region is delineated by a white line. For all images of one treatment
mode the median protein expression in the epithelium (intensity in the red
channel) is proﬁled against the relative distance from basal lamina to surface.

Ring-like stained nuclei, identiﬁed by a high ratio of border intensity to inner
intensity, were excluded from the watershed procedure.

For artiﬁcial skin cultures, we can assume that the epithelium exhibits
almost the same thickness (distance from basal lamina to surface) over
the whole section neglecting border regions. Therefore, the surface (or
more precisely the transition between stratum granulosum and stratum
corneum) can be approximated by smoothing the detected basal lamina and
a succeeding shift of the resulting line towards the epithelium. A shift of
1.4 times the maximum (95% quantile) nuclei distance from basal lamina
in the respective epithelial region proofed to be well ﬁtting. The epithelial
side exhibits a higher nuclei density than the side of the culture’s collagen
matrix. Therefore, the shifting direction could be determined by the nuclei
density in a band around the basal lamina.

For a closed epithelial area with sides vertical to the surface, the surface
pixels were ﬁtted by a line. The endpoints of the surface line were connected
with the detected basal lamina by orthogonals to the surface.

2.4 Relative distance and biomarker proﬁling

The spatial biomarker proﬁles were generated by measuring the mean
biomarker intensity (i.e. Hsp 27 recorded in the red channel) in multiple
bands inside the epithelium. The number and width of these bands is deﬁned
by intervals of relative distance (Pommerencke at al., 2008), where the
basal lamina is set to a distance of 0% and the surface to 100%. Finally,
the averaged marker intensity is plotted against the corresponding relative
distance for all intervals. For further analysis, the median of all proﬁles from
either each treatment mode (e.g. 6h SDS) or each individual culture were
calculated as well as for the estimation of the conﬁdence interval the 25%
and 75% quantiles (red lines in Fig. 1). Beside a marker proﬁle based on the
whole epithelial area, also proﬁles quantifying the marker intensity inside
the nuclei against relative distance were generated.

2.5 Feature extraction from expression proﬁles

Changes of the tissue’s state (either due to a tissue response following
treatment or a disease) lead to changes of the histological protein expression
patterns and hence to a shift or modiﬁed height of the biomarker proﬁle.
For quantiﬁcation and later classiﬁcation of the tissue responses, the
information in the biomarker proﬁles was consolidated into intelligible
features characteristic of the tissue’s state. In case of the protein Hsp27, SDS
treatment leads to a premature and cytoplasmic expression pattern with planar
appearance (see Fig. 1). In the proﬁle, a premature expression is reﬂected

expression pattern is reﬂected by a high integral of the proﬁle from the
starting point of expression to proﬁle’s end.

In the following, we present ﬁve possible features which are based on the
described observations:

0 StartExpression (SE): to determine the starting point of expression the
proﬁle curve with the highest slope is ﬁtted with a line. The intersection
of that line with the horizontal through the minimum marker intensity
was set as the starting point of expression (Fig. 2a). To approximate
the region of highest slope, the intensity difference (diﬂm) between
maximum and minimum intensity left to the maximum is calculated.
For line ﬁtting those discrete proﬁle points left to the maximum are
considered being in the range of [diﬂm/Z — diﬂm/S, diﬂnt/2 + diﬂm/S].
If there are no proﬁle points equalling the interval limits, those points
closest to the interval limits, but outside the range, are chosen for end
points.

intensity inside the nuclei against relative distance was calculated.

2.6 Tissue classiﬁcation

In any kind of toxicological application, single tissue samples of unknown
state have to be classiﬁed according to quantitative parameters describing the
tissue’s state. We here ask, to what extent the presented proﬁle features allow
the assignment of a degree of irritation to a single culture. As a reference
for an automatic classiﬁcation, all cultures were manually classiﬁed based

Fig. 3. Formalized classiﬁcation process. The ﬁrst line describes the feature
selection, in which the optimal subset F 0],, is deﬁned as that subset F of all
features fps yielding the minimum classiﬁcation error Up. The classiﬁcation
error is calculated as the average deviation of the control classes k and the
predicted classes [7 by the classiﬁcation model in a leave-one-out cross-
validation. A culture x, is predicted to belong to the ‘none class” ([7, = 1) if its
Mahalanobis distance dp(xi) falls below a certain threshold 9,» determined on
the remaining n— 1 cultures. This threshold is deﬁned as that Mahalanobis
distance for which the distance dRoc(6, i) of the ROC curve to the upper
left corner is minimal. The ROC curve is determined by calculating the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity on the n—l cultures for varying thresholds 6 of
the Mahalanobis distance.

on the visual inspection of one exemplary stained section for each culture.
According to the observed HSP27 expression pattern, two classes were
discriminated (no or strong change of expression).

For the automatic classiﬁcation, the Mahalanobis distance (Duda at al.,
2000) was used, which independently quantiﬁes the distance of one sample
to a control group in a multi-dimensional space while considering correlation
between the different dimensions. Each dimension reﬂects one of the basic
features (SE, ASE, etc.). In this way, the Mahalanobis distance maps several
features into one single measure, which then can be used for classiﬁcation by
thresholding. As a control group, we selected the untreated cultures (‘none
cultures”). The Mahalanobis distance d is calculated as:

d(x)=\l (x—MNone)TE_”(x—MNone) (4)

with x denoting the n-dimensional feature vector of one culture and p. the
n-dimensional mean vector of the None group. The superﬁxTis the matrix
transpose and 2‘1 the inverse of the n-by-n covariance matrix.

For the class assignment (none versus irritated) a separating threshold
for the Mahalanobis distance is required. For this, a ROC curve (Zweig
and Campbell, 1993) was generated by plotting the sensitivity against
l-speciﬁcity for each possible threshold and resulting class assignments. An
optimal threshold for the separation of the ‘none class” and the ‘irritant class”
refers to the point on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with
the minimum Euclidean distance to the upper left corner (100% sensitivity,
100% speciﬁcity). For a formalization of the classiﬁcation process see Fig. 3.

To assess the accuracy and the predictive power of the presented
classiﬁcation method, a leave-one-out-cross-validation (Kohavi, 1995) was
performed. The validation results for all test samples were averaged, giving
an estimate for the performance of the classiﬁer on an independent dataset.
This validation was carried out for each possible feature subset. Finally, that
subset yielding the smallest classiﬁcation error was selected. The algorithms
described above were implemented in Matlab R2008b.

3 RESULTS

For the quantiﬁcation of the treatment effect, the median of all
biomarker proﬁles for each treatment mode (e.g. 24h SDS) was

calculated. Based on these proﬁles, the ﬁve presented proﬁle features
were determined (except for the NucleiIntensity40-70, which is not
extracted from the proﬁles, but directly from the section images).
Figure 4 shows the change of the starting point of expression
depending on time as well as treatment mode. SE ranges between
38% (SDS) and 62% (None) relative distance. The observation
that most of the expression changes occurred during 40—70%
relative distance motivated the deﬁnition of the features A40_70 and
NucleiIntensity40- 70. In Figure 4, the time-dependent alterations of
the individual expression proﬁle features observed in SDS-treated
tissue cultures are compared to ‘none cultures”.

The strongest change is noticeable in the feature A40_70. At
a treatment duration of 24h, the area increases to 2.6-fold of
the area measured in ‘none cultures”. But also SE drops to
60% of the starting point in ‘none cultures”. However, we also
measured a change in PBS-treated cultures. Comparing SDS-treated
cultures to PBS-treated cultures discovers a 1.9-fold change in
ProﬁleExpressionArea40-70 at 16h treatment duration.

For the classiﬁcation of single cultures, the proﬁles of all
sub-images belonging to one culture were averaged. Based on
the resulting median proﬁle, the culture features were calculated.
The feature subset yielding the minimal classiﬁcation error after
translation into the Mahalanobis distance consists of the four features
SE, A SE, A40_70 and A Re]. The calculated Mahalanobis distance for
each culture is shown in Figure 4. The average threshold chosen for
classiﬁcation is illustrated as a horizontal in that diagram. The bars
of automatically irritated classiﬁed cultures are striped and those
manually classiﬁed by visual inspection are coloured in red. The
validation of the classiﬁcation procedure with the Leave-one-out-
method yielded a classiﬁcation error of 0.064, an average speciﬁcity
of 0.94 and a sensitivity of 0.92 compared with manual classiﬁcation
(see exemplary ROC-curve in Fig. 4d).

4 DISCUSSION

We here presented an approach for the quantitative capturing and
subsequent classiﬁcation of tissue response following substance-
induced perturbations. The approach comprises standardized skin
tissue cultures, whole slide-scanning, automated image processing
and classiﬁcation. We consider such a system ideally suited for
the quantitative toxicological study of chemicals. Since chemicals
of similar mechanisms of toxicity are expected to show similar
phenotypic effects, the endpoints of this method also qualify for
classiﬁcation.

In contrast to HCS, allowing the spatial quantiﬁcation of
molecules in single cell strains or cultures, our approach addresses
the question of how a ﬁill tissue with its complex structure
quantitatively reacts to perturbations. Besides the spatial layering, a
skin culture also exhibits a barrier formed by the stratum corneum
that is not present in cell strains. Substances applied to the surface
of normal skin have to pass this barrier before perturbations can be
induced at all.

Common in vitro methods for skin irritation testing like
the MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) test measure inside a homogenate thus loosing all
spatial information. Furthermore, the irritative effect is correlated
to the degree of cellular destruction (Coquette et al., 2003;
Mosmann, 1983). This makes these methods blind for early
and subtle modiﬁcations of the tissue before corrosion sets in.

Therefore, we here presented an approach based on measuring
the spatial and quantitative change of protein expression in
intact, immunoﬂuorescence-stained tissue sections. Recording
modiﬁcations at the protein level guarantees a certain expression
stability, as not being as transient as mRNA expression changes.
Based on the determined QSPs a multi-parametrical and automatic
classiﬁer was built, assigning to each tissue culture the status irritated
or non-irritated.

In our experimental setting, tissue cultures were treated for
different time durations with the stande irritant SDS. The visual
inspection of the cultures identiﬁed a considerable change in Hsp27
expression (premature, planar and increased) after ~6 h of treatment.
This change is clearly reﬂected in the QSPs when measuring
marker intensity against the normalized distance to basal lamina.
To quantify such changes in the QSPs, we presented ﬁve different
features extracted from the proﬁles (SE, ASE, A40_70, ARel and
NucleiIntensity40—70). The premature expression is reﬂected in an
early increase of the QSP. With SE we were able to determine the
onset of expression. The increase of total expression is manifested
in an increase of the QSP”s integral i.e. the area below the proﬁle.
We therefore developed features quantifying the proﬁle”s area (A SE,
A40_70, ARel). The determination of SE for all modes of treatment
revealed that most changes occur between 40% and 70% relative
distance. Hence, the features A40_70 and NucleiIntensity40-70
focus on this part of the QSP. The one-by-one comparison of all
features identiﬁed A40_70 as the feature with the most prominent
changes after treatment. However, the feature subset selection for

classiﬁcation by ﬁrst translating the multi-dimensional problem into
the Mahalanobis distance and then minimizing the classiﬁcation
error in a leave-one-out-validation revealed an optimal subset
consisting of SE, ASE, A40_70 and ARel.

Interestingly, the feature NucleiIntensity40-70 reﬂecting the
translocation of Hsp27 into the nuclei as described in literature
did not improve the classiﬁcation result. However, also the visual
inspection of the stained sections did not reveal a noticeable
translocation. The increase during treatment mainly arises from
the general expression increase in the area between 40% and 70%
relative distance.

Based on the selected feature subset we were able to reproduce
the manual classiﬁcation with our automatic classiﬁcation by the
Mahalanobis distance to ‘none cultures”. We report a speciﬁcity
of 0.94 and a sensitivity of 0.92 compared with the manual
classiﬁcation results based on the visually observed phenotype. We
therefore conclude that the presented features are well suited for the
characterization of the tissue”s response. The classiﬁcation result
in conjunction with the good conﬁdence intervals of the calculated
proﬁles argues for a well reproducible tissue response. We showed
that the observed spatial changes could be described by proﬁle
features allowing a precise classiﬁcation. This indicates a highly
suitable method for a standardized data acquisition in the context of
skin irritation.

To further increase the accuracy of our proﬁling method a staining
unambiguously delineating the epithelium would be preferable
to improve tissue segmentation. In the presented method, the

Spatial quantification and classification of skin response

 

epithelium is approximated based on a basal lamina and nuclear
staining assuming a constant epithelial thickness. However, our
literature search as well as own experiments did not reveal a suitable
protein marker stable under topical treatment with SDS.

As a marker for skin irritation we chose Hsp27 based on
literature (Boxman et al., 2002). Nevertheless, many other potential
biomarkers, as reported in association with skin irritation, could
be deployed with the presented method. Usually, such biomarkers
are identiﬁed by complementary techniques like RNA and protein
microarrays, or mass spectrometry (Fletcher and Basketter, 2006).
Our method could easily be extended to a multi-marker analysis by
staining of serial sections each with another biomarker or the use
of quantum dots thus giving a more comprehensive view on the
mechanisms of the tissue response.

In our approach, whole slide scanners are the key to a spatial
analysis as they allow the imaging of complete tissue sections in
a highly automated way. The resulting images have a resolution of
up to 0.23 um/pixel and thus also facilitate subcellular analyses. We
here deployed the nuclei staining to detect a translocation of Hsp27
to the nucleus. However, many other stainings e. g. for the membrane
are possible thus allowing the expression analysis in individual cells.

An important question in our study was how standardized
organotypic skin cultures actually are. Even though the good
conﬁdence intervals of the QSPs and the classiﬁcation result suggest
a highly reproducible tissue response we observed variations in
staining intensity as well as epithelial thickness. A ﬁiture way
to compensate staining variations would be to develop ﬁirther
intensity-independent measures like texture and to increase the
impact of intensity-independent measures during classiﬁcation like
the start of expression. Another possibility could be normalization
of the measured marker intensity against a reference marker. We
tried normalizing against the DAPI intensity inside a section, but
the correlation of variations in DAPI intensity and marker intensity
was low (data not shown). Thus, ﬁirther effort will be to put on the
establishment of a suitable reference marker. Variations in epithelial
thickness are mostly compensated by our proﬁling based on relative
distance. However, the penetration of a chemical strongly depends
on the thickness of the stratum comeum, which could be captured
by an additional staining.

Lastly, we would like to stress the enormous potential of
data acquisition deploying tissue cultures. Such an approach
not only complements data acquired from cell strains or lines
but also provides a replacement for animal tests. Besides the
important ethical issue, skin cultures also exhibit a higher degree of
standardization than animal experiments due to absent inter-animal
variations. Since about 1944, the irritative potential was predicted
using rabbits (Draize et al., 1944) that ﬁnally showed to be over-
predictive of human skin irritation (Robinson et al., 2002; Welss
et al., 2004).

Concluding, we here presented an innovative approach for the
standardized and automated quantiﬁcation of skin response after
perturbation mainly deploying tissue cultures and whole slide-
scanning. At the example of irritation testing we showed that
the tissue response is highly reproducible, thus allowing the
classiﬁcation based on spatial protein expression changes. Due to
its high degree of standardization and automation this method now
opens up new possibilities for the data acquisition for systems
biological models of the skin. By combining molecular expression
data with spatial information at the cell and ﬁirther more organ

level the presented way of data generation is highly suited for
multi-scale systems biological projects aiming at the tissue level
at multiple levels of biological abstraction (e.g. the USA ‘virtual
liver” project). Such multi-scale models are highly promising for
the understanding of tissue perturbations thus facilitating the risk
assessment of substances or drug development.

The approach presented here allows for the ﬁrst time the
controlled acquisition of quantitative and spatial data after
perturbation of organotypic skin cultures and thereby forms the basis
for quantitative computational models of higher complexity systems
like the human skin.

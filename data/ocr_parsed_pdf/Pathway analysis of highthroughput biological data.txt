ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most current approaches to high-throughput biological
data (HTBD) analysis either perform individual gene/protein analysis
or, gene/protein set enrichment analysis for a list of biologically
relevant molecules. Bayesian Networks (BNs) capture linear and non-
linear interactions, handle stochastic events accounting for noise,
and focus on local interactions, which can be related to causal
inference. Here, we describe for the first time an algorithm that
models biological pathways as BNs and identifies pathways that best
explain given HTBD by scoring fitness of each network.

Results: Proposed method takes into account the connectivity
and relatedness between nodes of the pathway through factoring
pathway topology in its model. Our simulations using synthetic data
demonstrated robustness of our approach. We tested proposed
method, Bayesian Pathway Analysis (BPA), on human microarray
data regarding renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and compared our results
with gene set enrichment analysis. BPA was able to find broader and
more specific pathways related to RCC.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput biological data (HTBD) are generated in a variety
of ways, including through deep sequencing and microarrays. These
data can provide a snapshot of regulatory processes in the cell
by inferring gene networks from experimental data. In particular,
Bayesian network (BN) models have gained popularity for the task
of learning biological pathways from microarray gene expression
data (Friedman et (11., 2000; Imoto et (11., 2002). In gene network
modeling studies using BNs, nodes generally represent expression
level of a gene and edges represent relationship between genes. BN
models capture both linear and non-linear interactions between sets
of random variables and handle stochastic events in a probabilistic
framework accounting for noise. This results in the emphasis of only

the strong relations in the observed data. BNs are, therefore, viable
candidates for modeling gene regulation systems, where stochastic
effects and large amounts of noise are expected. Furthermore, BNs
are able to focus on local interactions, where each node is directly
affected by a relatively small number of nodes and interactions
deﬁned by a BN can be related to causal inference (Friedman
et (11., 2000). These properties are similarly observed in biological
networks justifying the use of BNs in exploring pathways in the
setting of gene interaction networks, using HTBD.

Arguably the most popular HTBD type is microarrays, where an
identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes between two groups
of samples initially relied on individual gene analysis (IGA). An
alternative approach, called pathway analysis, functional enrichment
analysis or gene set analysis (GSA) (Nam and Kim, 2008), which
focuses on directly determining predeﬁned gene sets or Classes that
are signiﬁcantly regulated, has received a great deal of attention.
GSA methods score groups of genes and can identify genes that
exhibit subtle Changes at an individual level, but show concordant
enrichment within a set (Subramanian et (11., 2005). Here we propose
a new method of pathway analysis, which uses a graph theoretic
approach and BN theory to evaluate whether a putative pathway
successfully describes the underlying HTBD. Previously described
GSEA (Subramanian et (11., 2005) or Gene Ontology (Hosack et (11.,
2003) based methods do not take into account the connectiveness
of analyzed gene lists. There have been methods proposed to take
into account the GO graph topology (Alexa et (11., 2006), overlap
between GO categories in the GO hierarchy (Lu et (11., 2008) or
modeling interactions between GO categories (Bauer et (11., 2010)
in assessing the signiﬁcance of enrichment of a GO term based
on experimental data. However, none of these methods takes into
account the network or structure deﬁning the relation between the
genes in each category.

The proposed method [Bayesian Pathway Analysis (BPA)]
considers the topology via which genes interact with each other
when analyzing a group of genes. Using pathway information from
global databases, we model each biological pathway as a BN after
merging repeating entries and, if necessary, solving for cyclicity,
while preserving the dependencies entailed by the original pathway.
We consider the resulting BN, which is a graphical representation of
gene interactions rendered by the given pathway, with non-informal,
uniform belief priors. We quantify the degree to which observed
experimental data ﬁt this BN using Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent
(BDe) score calculation, where the BN is updated with input data

Fig. 1. DAGs are created from pathways in external databases, where, if necessary, multiple occurrences of same nodes are merged and cyclicity is resolved
preserving dependencies entailed by the original pathway. Nodes in DAGs and microarray probes are mapped using gene annotation information. Multiple

probes mapped to the same node are replaced by a robust average value followed by discretization of all signal values. A score metric, which is a measure
of probability of data given the ﬁxed network structure, is calculated. Signiﬁcance of this score (p-value) is assessed by randomization of input data via
bootstrapping. FDR values are calculated to account for multiple hypothesis testing.

during score calculation. We assess statistical signiﬁcance for the
score of each pathway by testing it against datasets generated by
applying randomization via bootstrapping. Results are evaluated in
forms of nominal p-values and false discovery rate (FDR) values
correcting for multiple hypotheses testing. Overall workﬂow used
in BPA is depicted in Figure 1.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer
deaths in the United States and has no established biomarker
for early detection or follow-up (Jones et (11., 2008; Mills et (11.,
2009). Most common histological subtypes of RCC are Clear-
Cell RCC (CRCC) and papillary RCC (pRCC) generally related to
deﬁciencies in von Hippel—Lindau, rapamycin complex 1 kinase
(mTOR) and fumarate hydratase (Brugarolas, 2007). Treatment for
metastatic RCC includes rather unspeciﬁc application of cytokine
therapies (e.g. interferon-oz and interleukin-2) and more targeted
use of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Sorafenib and Sunitinib),
mTOR inhibitors (Everolimus and Temsirolimus) and monoclonal
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody therapy with
Bevacizumab (Brugarolas, 2007; Mills et (11., 2009). These therapies
offer acceptable response rates (30—40%), but are not beneﬁcial in
overall survival. Therefore, a more detailed analysis of molecular
pathways underlying the RCC is essential. We have previously
analyzed transcriptional proﬁling of various RCC subtypes and
in a separate study obtained a predictive proteomic signature that
distinguishes between interleukin-2 therapy responders and non-
responders (Jones et (11., 2005; Jones et (11., 2008). Others have
also used gene expression and proteomic approaches to gain insight
into the molecular pathways governing RCC (Furge et (11., 2007;
Gumz et (11., 2007; Koeman et (11., 2008; Kort et (11., 2008; Lenburg
et (11., 2003; Perroud et (11., 2006; Wang et (11., 2009; Yang et (11.,

2005). In addition to CRCC and pRCC, we used BPA to analyze
the rare RCC subtype Chromophobe RCC (ChRCC) and other renal
malignancies, such as transitional cell cancers of the renal pelvis
(TCC) and Wilms’ tumors (WT) or benign renal tumors such as
oncocytomas (OC).

2 METHODS

2.1 Pathway information retrieval

Biochemical network data of pathways were retrieved from KEGG (Kanehisa
at (11., 2008), NCI/Nature Pathway Interaction Database (Schaefer at (11.,
2009), Reactome (Vastrik 61611., 2007) and HumanCyc (Romero at (11., 2005)
representing molecular interaction and reaction networks for metabolism,
genetic information processing, environmental information processing,
cellular processes and diseases.

2.2 Construction of directed acyclic graphs

A BN is a compact graphical representation of the joint probability
distribution over a set of random variables in the form of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG), where nodes represent random variables. The DAG encodes
assertions of conditional independence, which are generally represented as
a set of conditional probability tables (CPT). When modeling pathways as
BNs, we ﬁrst merge repeating entries (for example, Smad2/3 is present at
several locations in the KEGG TGFﬁ pathway, see Supplementary Figures SI
and S2), as a single node in the DAG while conserving edge relations.
Cyclic paths are eliminated using Spirtes’ method (Spirtes, 1995). In this
procedure, graph representation of structural equation models (SEM) is
converted to collapsed acyclic graphs such that d-separations in the collapsed
graph entails the same independency relations deﬁned by the model (Pearl,
2000). Cyclegroups (set of all cycles sharing at least one node) are found
using Tarjan’s algorithm (Tarjan, 1972). For a given BN, all d-separations

Bayesian pathway analysis

 

are conditional independencies and every conditional independency implied
by the BN is identiﬁed by d-separations (Neapolitan, 2004). Therefore, our
way of solving cyclicity preserves distributional features explained by the
pathway after it has been converted to a DAG.

2.3 Microarray data preprocessing and discretization

BPA assumes normalized data as an input. First, IDs used in the array
platform, corresponding to a given node in the pathway representation, are
pooled and one representative signal value per node is calculated using the
one-step Tukey’s biweight algorithm (Hoaglin et a1., 2000). Currently, BPA
addresses experimental designs consisting of two groups of samples (e.g.
cancer versus normal) though generalization of this framework to multiple
groups is straightforward. For a given BN (converted from a pathway),
we obtain observed fold changes (FCS) for genes in this BN (pathway) by
pairwise comparisons of samples in each group. This approach provides a
distribution of FC values and a reasonable dataset size used to score each
BN. Let $61 and SGZ represent two groups of samples in the dataset with
C1 and C2 samples in each group, respectively. Let ggj and gig]c be the
expression values of the i-th node in the pathway in j—th and k-th samples in
the sample groups 861 and SGZ, respectively, where 15 jﬁC 1 and lﬁkﬁCz.
Let Xi, lﬁiﬁN, represent the random variable for the i-th node in a BN with
N nodes. An ordered set of observations, 0, for the dataset is obtained by
pairwise comparison of all samples in sample groups 861 and SGZ. The
l-th element of 0, 01, corresponds to comparison of j—th and k-th samples
in the sample groups 861 and SGZ such that l =j—GC2+k, where lﬁjCl
and lﬁkﬁCz. Thus, the cardinality of 0 is C1 xC2. Each 01 is a vector with
dimension equaling the number of nodes in the pathway, N , such that the i-th
element of 01, 01,-, equals gig]c /g,-1j, where j and k are related to l as described
above. The data matrix D, with elements dh- is obtained from 0 such that (1;,-
equals 1 if 01i< 0.5 or all->2 (i.e. a gene is dysregulated) and 2 otherwise.
To this end, we have converted each pathway into a BN, where nodes of the
BN represent nodes in the pathway and node random variables are identiﬁed
by discretized FC values. Nodes of BNs are assumed to follow Dirichlet
distribution and are initialized using the equivalent sample size method for
prior beliefs (Neapolitan, 2004). The matrix D, which consists of N columns
and C1 x C2 rows, is sequentially evaluated row by row, where each row is
used to update the Dirichlet distribution parameters used at the nodes of BN.
Upon conclusion of evaluation of D, the score for the BN is calculated as
described below.

2.4 Bayesian score metric

Following discretization, the nodes in the BN model represent discrete
random variables with a multinomial distribution. Dirichlet distribution is
chosen as the conjugate prior to the multinomial distribution. For a given
BN model, the probability of observing data is (Neapolitan, 2004):

Nth

P(Data|Model)—1—H—[ ﬂ n 
—z:lj:l UNI? +Mif) k:1 name)

where N is the number of nodes, qi is the number of different states of
node’s parents and n is the set of values a node can take on. N9 is the
sum of corresponding Dirichlet distribution hyper-parameters aijk. Mij is
the number of times that the parents of node i take on conﬁguration j in the
dataset. Of these M if cases, sijk is the total number of times in the sample that
node i is observed to have value k when its parents take on conﬁguration j.
The equation above is used as a score metric and named Bayesian scoring
criterion (BSC) (Heckerman et a1., 1995). Hyper-parameters, aijk, can be
determined using the equivalent sample size method (i.e. sum of the initial
Dirichlet parameters, used at each node, have the same total), in which case
the score is called the BDe (Neapolitan, 2004). Details of the scoring scheme
are found in the Supplementary Material.

2.5 Estimation of score signiﬁcance by randomization
via bootstrapping

At this point, we have BNs converted from pathways, a data matrix D for
each BN representing observed, discretized FC values for genes (nodes)
represented in the BN and BDe score calculated for the BN using the
observed D matrix. We assess statistical signiﬁcance of the BDe score, Sn,
calculated for n-th BN by using randomization via bootstrapping. We use a
data-generating process and estimate a distribution of the score S given the
null hypothesis that scores are the result of pure chance. For a one-tailed test
with a rejection region in the upper tail, the bootstrap p-value for Sn, P(S,,),
is estimated by the proportion of randomized samples that yield a score > S”.
If we have B randomized datasets, then

1 B

k2]

where I is the indicator function yielding 1 if the Bayesian score is better
than the original network score and 0 otherwise and Sk is the score of the BN
using k-th randomized dataset. As B goes to inﬁnity, the estimated p-value
will tend to the ideal p-value and the error in estimation will be kept minimal
(Davison and Hinkley, 1997; Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).

The process for generating the randomized samples is as follows: suppose
dataset D is composed of M cases for a total of N genes and can be
considered as an M xN matrix where l-th row d1=[dl1 ,d12,. . ., le]. 1515M
and (11,- is the value of the i-th node (gene) in the l-th instance of input data.
For each node X i, we sample with replacement M instances from the i-th
column, [d1i, d2i,  dMi]T, of the original data matrix D and obtain the
newly formed column of the bootstrapped data matrix Dk. The BDe score
for this new data matrix is calculated and the whole process is repeated
B times. The approach we adopt here has previously been described and
applied to phylogeny reconstruction using molecular sequences (Brown,
1994; Davison and Hinkley, 1997). Bootstrap alone, which is generally
used to establish conﬁdence, would not be ﬁtting to assess signiﬁcance in
the current setting. Therefore, we provide randomization via bootstrapping,
which provides an approximation of the null distribution. When scoring a BN,
the rows of D, which hold information reﬂecting the dependency relation
between nodes of BN, are considered sequentially in order to update the
parameters of each node on the BN. We randomize rows of D by changing
the structure of columns of D via sampling with replacing each column of
D separately. Querying each pathway database that holds few hundreds of
networks generates a multiple hypothesis testing problem (utilized KEGG
database contributes over 200 pathways). We address this issue by calculating
FDR, using BenjarniniiHochberg procedure, applied on p-values calculated
for each pathway (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

The overall complexity of the BPA is 0(N2 +E2 +BC2G), where N is the
number of nodes, E is the number of edges, G is the number of genes, C is
the number of samples and B is the number of bootstrap datasets. Modeling
of pathways as DAGs is quadratic in N and E for Spirtes’ algorithm and
linear in N and E for Tarjan’s algorithm. Data discretization is quadratic in
C and linear in G. BDE score calculation is 0(BN2G). Modeling pathways
as DAGs is done off line, which does not lead to the computational time of
a single analysis.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Identiﬁcation of data ﬁtting to network

We tested our method to assign signiﬁcance to BDe scores
on eight synthetic binary BNs of different sizes and the well-
known Alarm and Asia BNs. The Alarm BN is designed to
identify anesthesia problems with 37 nodes of 2, 3 or 4 states
(Beinlich et (11., 1989) and the eight-node binary Asia BN
is designed to calculate the probability of a patient having
tuberculosis (Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988). All 10 networks

along with their CPTs can be found in the Supplementary
Material. Synthetic BNs have (average :I: SD) 25.38 :I: 13.87 nodes,
24.38 :I: 13.87 links and 1.93 :l: 0.08 average degree reﬂecting
a spectrum of typical biological networks (see Supplementary
Material). For each BN, we used two datasets to calculate BDe
scores and their signiﬁcance: one that follows the underlying
CPT and one that does not. For a given BN, we randomly
ﬁxed Dirichlet hyper-parameters for each node and generated data
that follow this CPT using the Bayes Net Toolbox (BNT) for
Matlab (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/BNT/bnt.html).
CPTs calculated from this data are considered ideal as they are based
on data following the ﬁxed CPT for a given BN. For inconsistent
CPTs, we chose Dirichlet hyper-parameters to be equal for each
node and obtained data using BNT. Therefore, the underlying CPTs
calculated from this randomly generated data are considered to
be the non-ideal CPT as they are not based on data reﬂecting
dependency structure implied by the given BN. We used datasets
with a size of 1000, the bootstrap test count was chosen to be 2000
and an equivalent sample size of 1 for Dirichlet hyper-parameters
was used during BDe score calculation. The results summarized in
Table 1 show that when the data following underlying CPTs are
used, p-values indicate strong signiﬁcance and are very close to
zero (P <5 >< 10_4). Conversely, when data generated using CPTs
not consistent with independencies entailed by the ENS are used,
p-values are severely deteriorated. Therefore, datasets produced
from inconsistent CPTs are quickly detected by BPA.

3.2 Sample size

In real life microarray experiments, the number of samples rarely
exceeds 100 due to technical and ﬁnancial limitations rendering
limited number of observations to assess change in expression of
a given gene. In order to see the effect of this limitation on BPA, we
tested BNs in Table 1 with varying sizes of datasets (using CPTs that
follow the underlying BN structure: dataset size 20—200, and CPTs
that are non-ideal for the underlying BN structure: dataset size 20—
300) and calculated the signiﬁcance of corresponding BDe scores.
For each dataset size, 50 runs have been performed. The average
p-value of the runs, each obtained using 1000 bootstrapped samples,
and associated standard errors are shown in Figure 2A and B. In case
of ideal CPTs, p-values start to get lower after a small increase in the
sample size with highest attainable signiﬁcance (P < 10‘3) at sizes

>140. This is a dataset size that can be generated by the proposed
method in an experimental setting, where one has 12 samples in each
of the two groups [BPA would generate 12 X 12: 144 observations
for each BN (see Section 2.3)]. In case of non-ideal CPTs, p-values
remain high regardless of the dataset size (see also Table 1). These
results suggest that BPA can successﬁilly be used with datasets
commonly seen in real experimental settings.

3.3 Change in pathway structure

Biological pathways may be incomplete as some of the nodes and/or
edges for a given cascade of events may not have been identiﬁed
yet. In order to test for the effect of missing edges and nodes on the
signiﬁcance of BDe scores calculated by BPA, we systematically
removed all possible k edge combinations, 1 SkSS, for BNs listed
in Table 1. For each k, we calculated the average p-value obtained
by removing different combinations using a dataset size of 140
(following the underlying CPT) with 1000 bootstraps. We repeated
the same procedure by removing all combinations of nodes. Results
are shown in Figure 2C and D. In both cases, all BNs maintain
signiﬁcant results despite removal of up to ﬁve edges and/or nodes,
except for BN2 (eight nodes and seven edges), BN5 (18 nodes
and 17 edges) and Asia BN (eight nodes and eight edges), which
have smallest number of nodes and edges among the 10 synthetic
networks. Note that the effect of node removal is more severe
as when a node is removed so are all the edges connected to it.
Robustness to node/edge removal is possibly due to the factorized
scoring metric and the ENS ability to focus on local interactions,
where each node is directly affected by a relatively small number of
parent nodes and interactions. The synthetic networks tested follow
average node/edge distribution in typical biological pathways and
the removal of up to ﬁve nodes/edges is likely to be very high
compared to the pathway error instances seen in real biological
pathways, which makes application of BPA for pathway analysis
possible.

3.4 Application to synthetic datasets

We ﬁrst looked at whether our method of solving cyclicity
could create large cliques and inversely affect the BPA’s overall
performance. We generated 20 synthetic directed graphs containing
cyclic paths following an SEM (Bollen, 1989), using TETRAD IV
(http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/tetrad/tetrad4.html) (Scheines,
1996). The corresponding acyclic collapsed versions of synthetic
cyclic graphs show ~2.7—2.8 times the increase in number of nodes,
number of edges, maximum degree, average degree and density of
the networks, on average. The BPA was run on a 1000 size dataset
with 1000 bootstraps and resulted in signiﬁcant p-values (lowest
attainable) in all cases when we generated data that follow SEMs.
These results suggest that our method of handling cyclicity may
generate large cliques; however, the BPA is not adversely affected
by the proposed method of generating DAGs from biological
pathways (for details, see Supplementary Material).

We then compared performance of the BPA with GSEA v2
(Subramanian et (11., 2007) and a model-based approach, GlobalTest
(Goeman et (11., 2004) using Bioconductor v2.7, GlobalTest v5.4.0
package on synthetic datasets approximating real microarray data.
We generated synthetic transcriptional regulatory networks and
produced simulated gene expression data with noise using SynTReN
v1.12 (Van den Bulcke et (11., 2006). We created 60 synthetic

networks (58/60 have cycles) with sizes ranging from 2 to
200. Details of the networks’ parameters are included in the
Supplementary Material. We randomly selected 25 out of 60
pathways to be active and SynTReN generated corresponding
expression datasets for 20 test and 20 normal samples with 2249
synthetic genes adding a 4% noise level. For all three methods,
we used 1000 bootstraps and chose a nominal p-value and FDR
cutoff values of 0.05 and 0.25, respectively. We assessed accuracy
(if a network—or corresponding gene set—is correctly called
active/inactive) of the three algorithms for 10 simulated datasets
and provide the results in Table 2.

BPA was tested for FC cutoff values (C0) of 2 and 3, and
discretization levels of 2 (i.e. if a gene’s FC is above CO or below
l/CO, i.e. a gene is dysregulated, we insert a 1 in the observation
data matrix D, otherwise we insert a 2) and 3 (i.e. we insert a 1, 2 or 3
in the observation data matrix D, if a gene’s FC is above CO, below
l/CO, between CO and l/CO, inclusive, respectively). These results

suggest that BPA outperforms both GSEA and GlobalTest and there
is no signiﬁcant change in using two or three levels of discretization
in BPA with a slight improvement in performance when a FC cutoff
of 3 is used. We used two-level discretization with an FC cutoff of 2
when applying BPA to real datasets. A two-level discretization seems
more natural as we do not keep activator/repres sor information when
modeling biological pathways as DAGs and an FC cutoff of 2 allows
BPA to capture subtle changes.

3.5 Application to real RCC dataset

We applied BPA on real RCC datasets in order to identify the
underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease (Table 3). In each
experiment, every cancer subtype was individually compared to the
normal samples generating 16 datasets in total. BNs corresponding
to biological pathways are scored using BDe with an equivalent
sample size of 1 for Dirichlet hyper-parameters and a selected subset
of those that remain signiﬁcant after 1000 bootstraps are shown in
Table 4. We list CPU times for BPA in the Supplementary Material,
which is 30:l: 10min (averagezl: SD) for the 16 analyzed datasets,
where the time given is for the complete analysis of a single dataset.
Running times range from 17 to 57 min. Analysis was performed on
an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU E6550 2.33 GHz processor with Windows
XP 32bit OS. We also analyzed the 16 datasets using GSEA and
GlobalTest. In all three methods, the p-value and FDR cutoff values
were chosen to be 0.05 and 0.25, respectively. In order to avoid the
problem of pathway alignment that would arise if multiple pathway
sources were used, we limited our analysis to the KEGG pathway
database for this exemplary case. In case of GSEA and GlobalTest,

we used MSigDB v2.5 (group CP under C2). The complete list of
signiﬁcant pathways for each method and a comparative analysis
are included in the Supplementary Material.

Most of the pathways deemed signiﬁcant by BPA agree with
those found in the literature, using genomic and proteomic
approaches. For example, arginine and proline metabolism, citrate

acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathways have been
shown to be important in RCC analyzed using a proteomic approach
(Perroud et (11., 2006). On the other hand, signiﬁcant pathways
found in different subtypes show notable agreement among datasets
analyzed. Using BPA, we found 25 pathways signiﬁcant in at least
half of the datasets; this number was only nine for GSEA (see
Supplementary Material). In BPA, on an average, 10.6 datasets were
found signiﬁcant by each of the 25 pathways (for a total dataset
occurrence of 265), while GSEA’s average was 9.3 signiﬁcant
datasets per pathway (for a total dataset occurrence of 84). When
we considered pathways deemed signiﬁcant for at least one dataset,
we found 129 pathways discovered by BPA yielding 571 dataset
occurrences in total and 121 pathways discovered by GSEA resulting
in 390 dataset occurrences. BPA was able to ﬁnd ~63% of pathways
discovered by GSEA. Overall, these results indicate that BPA found
a greater pathway base related and speciﬁc to RCC as compared
to GSEA. We believe this enhancement in performance is due to
the ability of BPA to take into account connectedness of genes
that make up a pathway; whereas in the GSEA analysis, such
genes are only considered as a list and no topological information
is incorporated into the analysis. GlobalTest results indicated 199
signiﬁcant pathways (out of 206) for 2974 dataset occurrences
yielding ~14.95 average datasets (out of 16) deemed signiﬁcant

for each pathway. We include complete results of GlobalTest in
Supplementary Material as pathway selection with this method
showed little speciﬁcity (~97% of tested pathways found signiﬁcant
for ~90% of the datasets). Similar behavior for GlobalTest have been
observed previously by other studies potentially due to distributional
assumptions (that regression coefﬁcients for the genes come from
the same normal distribution) and errors in empirical covariance
estimates, made by this approach, leading to high false positive rates,
especially in cases with small sample sizes (Gatti et (11., 2010; Liu
et (11., 2007). Furthermore, GlobalTest loses signiﬁcant power when
a given gene list contains correlated genes, which holds true for
genes in a given pathway (Mansmann and Meister, 2005).

Out of 12 pathways shown in Table 4, which were shown to be
related to RCC using an experimental proteomic approach, BPA
found 117 dataset occurrences for which these pathways were
signiﬁcant (~61% of possible 12 X 16 = 192 dataset occurrences),
while GSEA could only identify 50 (~26%) dataset occurrences.

BPA was also able to yield high consensus among pathways found
signiﬁcant for a given RCC subtype. In Figure 3, we show the
overlap of pathways found signiﬁcant for cRCC subtype in four
different datasets. More than 70% of pathways found in four datasets
are shared by at least two datasets, while eight pathways were
common to all. Among these eight pathways, six of them (except
for nicotine and folate pathways) have been shown to be activated
in RCC based on a proteomic approach (Perroud et (11., 2006).

Results summarized in Table 4 put forth molecular mechanisms
that are not only subtype speciﬁc, but also commonly seen in
different RCC tumors. The complexity/relevance of some of these
pathways can be exempliﬁed by the activation of the insulin
signaling pathway through the activation of the insulin growth factor
receptor-1 that activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. PI3Ks
catalyze the conversion of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP)
2 to PIP 3 (inositol phosphate metabolism). PIP 3 acts as a second
messenger to activate Akt. Akt mediates the activation of mTOR
that is responsible for its effects on cell growth. In addition to
activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, IGFR-l also activates the
Ras/MAPK/Raf/MEK/ERK mitogenic signaling pathway (MAPK
signaling pathway). Subsequently, this leads to an activation of the
cell cycle transition through stimulation of cyclin D1 (Cell cycle) and
to increased cell proliferation. These prominent cellular pathways
have been the objective for most of the targeted therapies now

used in metastatic RCC. mTOR inhibitors act on PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway leading to an inhibition of protein synthesis and cell cycle
arrest, while some receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Sorafenib)
also affect Raf, blocking the MAPK mitogenic signaling pathway.
In addition, both approaches inhibit angiogenesis that has a strong
impact in RCC tumorigenesis and progression. Interestingly, further
studies are underway analyzing possible composite or sequential
therapies blocking these pathways for the identiﬁcation of the
optimal therapeutic approach. However, different targets within
other pathways, described here, may lead to additional successful
results and should be explored further. According to our analysis, one
of these novel pathways could be the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
metabolism, which has been associated with lung cancer, but not
with RCC (Creighton et (11., 2003). Indeed, metabolism-related
pathways have been shown to play a role in RCC progression and
would therefore be reasonable targets for further in-depth analysis
and in vitro testing.

4 DISCUSSION

We described a method that models biological pathways as BNs
and determines the ﬁtness of given microarray data using BDe
score. The proposed method overcomes representation, mapping,
data discretization and cyclicity problems that arise in modeling
pathways as BNs. We have chosen multinomial BNs with Dirichlet
priors because: (i) their posterior can be efﬁciently calculated in
closed form; (ii) they capture non-linear interactions; and (iii) they
render a plain model requiring less parameter adjustment. Moreover,
algorithms scoring mutinomial BNs have low time complexity.
Alternative models such as linear Gaussian models, Gaussian
process networks or regression models are usually preferred in the
task of structure learning. Linear Gaussian models and regression
models in BN setting can only detect linear dependencies between
the child and parent variables. In Gaussian process BN models,
Gaussian process priors are used as parametric families to model
non-linear relations. However, the problem then becomes one of
selecting the best ﬁtting covariance ﬁinction and the number of
its hyperparameters in Gaussian process modeling, which requires
various approximations and assumptions that may not be suitable in
HTBD settings (Friedman and Nachman, 2000).

RCC represents a spectrum of genetically diverse epithelial
tumors with a common derivation from the renal tubular epithelium
and a variable clinical course. Approximately 30% of cases present
with metastatic disease at initial diagnosis and 30% of initially organ
conﬁned cases develop metastases during later follow up. Since there
are no reliable biomarkers available, patient management remains
problematic despite improving understanding of the underlying
molecular mechanisms. In particular, treatment of advanced RCC
still poses a great challenge, as the RCC is resistant to chemo-
and radiation therapy and cytokine-based therapies offer only low
clinical response rates with considerable toxicity. The advent of
targeted therapy has brought exciting therapeutic options with
promising clinical results, although the clinical beneﬁt with respect
to overall survival is only marginal. However, high-throughput
technologies that analyze the entire genome and proteome promise
to elucidate the heterogeneity of this disease and eventually enable a
patient-tailored, individualized treatment. In contrast to the analysis
of single genes, gene pathways enable us to see the context of
complex interactions and to understand the biologic relevance

of their expression. The plethora of pathways presented in our
manuscript mirror complex biologic processes in kidney tumors and
is often closely intertwined.

Overall, we believe the proposed approach provides a unique
perspective that merges BN theory and HTBD analysis. Most
BN models employed on HTBD use time series experimental
designs in order to increase the size of the observed data. We have
overcome this bottleneck and provided a tool that can be used
with most common experimental settings interpreting the results
within the context of known biological pathways. Moreover, existing
BN approaches on HTBD generally focus on building networks
from input data, which makes these approaches applicable on a
few dozens of genes due to the complexity of structure learning
algorithms. Given the fact that high-throughput platforms generate
data for tens of thousands of genes, the proposed approach makes
use of relevant experimental information and is applied to the
complete dataset within the context of known biological pathways.
Our simulations on synthetic and real datasets show that BPA is
able to successﬁilly ﬁnd molecular mechanisms that best describe
underlying HTBD.

Abstract

Motivation: RNA interference (RNAi) technology is being developed as a weapon for pest insect
control. To maximize the specificity that such an approach affords we have developed a bioinfor—
matic web tool that searches the ever—growing arthropod transcriptome databases so that pest—
specific RNAi sequences can be identified. This will help technology developers finesse the design
of RNAi sequences and suggests which non—target species should be assessed in the risk assess—
ment process.

1 Introduction

RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful reverse—genetics tool rou—
tinely used to reduce or eliminate gene activity within an organism.
RNAi is most commonly applied in ‘functional genomics’ screens of
laboratory model organisms and cell lines (Crane and Gelvin, 2007;
Dietzl et (11., 2007; Kamath, 2003). RNAi technology is also being
developed for so called ‘environmental RNAi’ where it can be
applied to free—living organisms such as pest insects (Smagghe and
Swevers, 2014). The key attribute of RNAi for all these applications
is its specificity, which is determined by sequence identity between
the RNAi molecule and the target gene. However the nature of spe—
cificity—requirements differs between applications. In reverse genetic
screens of model organisms a premium is placed on targeting the
specified target gene and no other ‘offtarget’ genes. There are many
web—based tools to help with the design of such RNAi molecules
(Arziman et (11., 2005; Mathews, 2010; http://www.ﬂyrnai.org/snap
dragon). However for environmental applications species—specificity
is just as important as gene—specificity.

The application of RNAi to pest control is an attractive alterna—
tive to traditional control chemicals because it has the potential to

only target pest species. Among the pests for which this technology
is being developed are beetles, moths, locusts and various phloem
feeders including aphids (Christiaens and Smagghe, 2014; Li et (11.,
2013; McHale et (11., 2013; Mutti et (11., 2008; Tian et (11., 2009). A
challenge of such an approach is in the delivery of RNAi—inducing
molecules to pest organisms. This might be achieved by expressing
dsRNA in transgenic crop plants that are hosts for the pests being
targeted (Whyard, 2015), or by using sprays containing either naked
dsRNA molecules or dsRNA molecules packaged within micro—
organisms (Palli, 2014). The former approach has been taken by
Monsanto, which has developed transgenic crop plants that produce
dsRNA against the western corn rootvvorm (Diabrotica virgifera
virgifera). Bolognesi et al. (2012) showed that ingestion of a 240 nu—
cleotide RNAi sequence directed to the rootvvorm snf7 gene is lethal.
Experiments surveying ten insect families found that only closely
related beetles, those sharing at least three 21—mers with the dsRNA
sequence, were affected by consuming the snf7 dsRNA molecule
(Bachman et (11., 2013). This not only demonstrates the potential
specificity of the technology but also illustrates the fact that only a
small number of 21mers (siRNA’s) may elicit a response.

Given the likelihood that RNAi—based technologies may be
entering our agricultural landscapes in the near future it is critically
important to establish the species—specificity of such RNAi—inducing
molecules. We have developed a bioinformatic tool that searches
transcriptomic databases that will (i) assist RNAi—technology devel—
opers in maximizing the pest specificity of RNAi molecules and (ii)
provide information for regulatory authorities and the public on the
relative environmental risks that these molecules have on non—target
organisms. This web—based tool is called ‘OffTargetFinder’ and the
various outputs it provides, enables users to refine the regions within
gene of interest, so as to eliminate potential off—target effects in other
arthropod species. It can also be used to identify which species
should be tested experimentally in the ecological risk assessment
process (Romeis et al., 2013).

2 Methods

The user interface is designed using ExtJS3 (http://www.sencha.
com/products/extjs/). The bioinformatics search is driven by custom
PERL script that uses the Bowtie software (Langmead et al., 2008)
to rapidly search transcriptomes for 21mers with or without mis—
matches. It is then visualized using the CanvasXpress genome
browser package (http://canvasxpress.org/). At the time of submis—
sion of this manuscript OffTargetFinder screens 101 Arthropod
transcriptomes, including representatives from the 32 currently rec—
ognized orders within the subphylum Hexapoda, and from three
other Arthropod subphyla; Crustacea, Myriapoda and Chelicerata.
The database of transcriptomes includes sequences from the 1000
Insect Transcriptome Evolution (1KITE) dataset (http://www.1kite.
org; Misof et al., 2014). Various other transcriptomes are also
included such as those from humans, the model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana, and our annotation of the Myzns persicae genome using
Exonerate (Slater and Birney, 2005) queries with the pea aphid
transcriptome.

3 Usage

3.1 Enter query sequence
OffTargetFinder is accessed freely over the web at http://rnai.speci
ﬂy.org.

The user pastes a DNA sequence in the FASTA format (with no
white spaces in the definition line) that they believe may be a good
RNAi target (e.g. a gene that is essential for pest insect viability).
Users then specify how many mismatches (0, 1, 2, 3) will be toler—
ated in each window of 21 nucleotides. Once the ‘Find Off Targets’
button is chosen the query appears in the History table and the sta—
tus of the job is reported. For multiple queries, a separate window
can be opened for each query sequence that is submitted. The user
can check for changes in query status by reloading their browser.
They can view results when query status is completed. The green
colored text indicates query has returned hits and red text indicates
no hits were found. The program takes about 15 minutes to run, and
when completed results can be viewed by clicking on the motif in
the Show Result column.

3.2 Results page

A view of three panels is seen in the results tab. The top panel shows
the query sequence and the panel on the left (Organism classiﬁcation
panel) shows a cladogram of taxonomic ranks in which hits are
observed. The cladogram splits ‘Arthropods’ (most of the species
considered) from ‘Others’ (which includes unclassified) and shows

Order, Family, Genus and Species names that are based on 1KITE
species classifications. The colour of the box next to the taxa names
reﬂects the number of ‘hits’ observed in that taxa (purple : 1 hit,
dark blue: 2—5, light blue : 6—10, green : 11—20, yellow : 21—50,
orange : 51—100, red > 101). The plus and minus signs on the
nodes of the cladogram can be clicked to collapse and expand those
nodes. If the coloured boxes are clicked the analysis in the Query
Result panel is limited to the species of that clade.

The Query Result panel houses a variety of different views that
can be toggled between by clicking on view button.

3.3 View: browser

Among these views is ’Browser’ which lists each species that has at
least one ‘hit’ with the input sequence and indicates the location of
the hits in a cartoon, much like the first figure of an NCBI Blast
search (Fig. 1). A feature of this view is that the user can zoom in to
nucleotide resolution to see the exact 21mer sequences responsible
for the off—target hit/s.

3.4 View: query hit regions

The view provided by the ‘Query Hit Regions’ paints the query se—
quence in colours according to the number of 21mers in the data—
base (or the portion of the database delimited by the Organism
Classification panel) that match that particular 21 bp window. With
this tool the user will identify stretches of nucleotides that are highly
specific to the targeted species. This output will be useful in ensuring
that a particular dsRNA molecule has minimal off—target hits.

Fig. 1. Offtarget hits using the snf7 gene. The 240nt sequence of the Snf7
gene from the beetle Diabrotica virgifera that was experimentally tested for
cross-species hits by Bachman er al. (2013) was used as the query sequence
in OffTargetFinder. Five hits were observed (see cladogram on the left
panel), and they are distributed across the orders Plecoptera (a stonefly),
Diptera (specifically a tsetse fly and a bee-fly), Neuroptera (a lacewing) and
Mantodea (a praying mantis). This could motivate risk assessments, like the
Bachman er al. (2013) experiments, on these particular ‘off target' species.
The large panel to the right of the cladogram shows which parts of the
query contains at least one 21-mer hit across the five species. Note that in
each of the cases here the hits are limited to one contiguous hit region. Note
also that one region in the query sequence hits four distantly related non-
target species. The specific nucleotides that are hitting the off target species
are observed in the bottom panel. Together these views demark sequences
that should be avoided in RNAi designs to ensure taxonomically limited
RNAi pesticides

3.5 View: raw data

It is also possible to obtain a table of the number of 21mer ‘hits’
observed in each species (‘Raw data’). In this, as in all other views,
clicking on the ‘Eukaryote’ box in the left panel will display all the
results, whereas clicking on any subordinate box restricts the data in
the view box to the subset of taxa selected.

3.6 View: bar graph
The number of hits in each species can also be observed as bar charts
with the x—axis having the species and the y—axis the hit count.

4 Conclusions

The web tool OfftargetFinder can be used to identify stretches of nu—
cleotides that do not contain 21mer matches with a library of over
100 arthropod transcriptomes. It can therefore be used to design
RNAi pesticides likely to have a narrow spectrum of affected species.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene set enrichment has become a critical tool for inter-
preting the results of high-throughput genomic experiments.
Inconsistent annotation quality and lack of annotation specificity, how-
ever, limit the statistical power of enrichment methods and make it
difficult to replicate enrichment results across biologically similar
datasets.

Results: We propose a novel algorithm for optimizing gene set
annotations to best match the structure of specific empirical data
sources. Our proposed method, entropy minimization over variable
clusters (EMVC), filters the annotations for each gene set to minimize
a measure of entropy across disjoint gene clusters computed for a
range of cluster sizes over multiple bootstrap resampled datasets. As
shown using simulated gene sets with simulated data and Molecular
Signatures Database collections with microarray gene expression
data, the EMVC algorithm accurately filters annotations unrelated to
the experimental outcome resulting in increased gene set enrichment
power and better replication of enrichment results.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene set enrichment is widely used for the analysis and
interpretation of the large molecular datasets generated by
modern biomedical science (Hung et al., 2012; Khatri et al.,
2012). Despite the development of robust statistical enrichment
methods (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007; Subramanian et al., 2005;
Wu and Smyth, 2012) and extensive functional ontologies such
as the Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000), the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000) and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)
(Liberzon et al., 2011) with annotations for many biological mol-
ecules across numerous species, the results of enrichment analysis
are too often overly general, inaccurate or non-reproducible
across experiments (Khatri et al., 2012).

Although changes to statistical methods or refinements of
functional ontologies can improve enrichment performance,

annotation completeness and quality is often a dominant
factor driving enrichment accuracy and reproducibility.
The annotation of most genes and gene products is incom-
plete with only a sparse set of annotations to generic high-level
categories available (Faria et al., 2012). For those annota-
tions that do exist, the overwhelming majority are automatically
generated on the basis of sequence or structural similarity
without any curatorial review (du Plessis et al., 2011; Juncker
et al., 2009). Such automatically generated annotations have
known quality issues relative to manually curated annotations,
especially those based on published experimental ﬁndings (Bell
et al., 2012; Dolan et al., 2005; Faria et al., 2012; Park et al.,
2011; Schnoes et al., 2009; Skunca et al., 2012). Electronic
annotations are slowly being replaced with higher-quality
annotations backed by experimental evidence; however,
given the slow pace of experimental validation and manual
curation, the preponderance of unreViewed computational
annotations and continual generation of new automated annota-
tions, annotation quality will remain a challenge into the fore-
seeable future.

Current approaches to annotation quality fall into one of
several groups: those that create a filtered version of existing
annotations, those that subset and/or restructure existing
functional ontologies and those that deﬁne new, customized,
gene sets. In the context of GO, automatic annotation ﬁltering
includes methods that use evidence codes, e.g. the MSigDB C5
collection (Liberzon et al., 2011), as well as approaches that use
the ontology hierarchy to identify and remove redundant anno-
tations (Faria et al., 2012). Methods that subset or restructure
ontologies include tools for the manual (Binns et al., 2009;
Carbon et al., 2009) or automatic (Davis et al., 2010) generation
of GO Slims as well as techniques for the information theoretic
optimization of the entire GO taxonomy (Alterovitz et al., 2010).
The process used to generate the MSigDB C4 cancer modules
(Segal et al., 2004) combines both automatic gene set generation
with gene set refinement. In the cancer module process, modules
are generated by merging and then refining existing gene sets
with gene clusters computed from a large collection of tumor
gene expression microarrays.

Although manually customized annotation collections can
achieve high speciﬁcity, they require domain expertise to cre-
ate and suffer from ad hoc methods that limit the relevance of
any subsequent analysis results. While automatic methods for
annotation ﬁltering and ontology sub-setting do not suffer
from individual researcher bias, their general purpose nature
can prevent them from aligning with the narrow scientiﬁc

domain under investigation. An important limitation of
many current automatic annotation filtering and ontology sub-
setting methods is the fact that analysis is only based on the
structure of the ontology and the content of the underlying
annotation databases. The experimentally observed abundance
of the annotated genes and gene products is not used to help
identify low-quality annotations or guide ontology restructuring.
By focusing on just ontological and annotation data, these
methods provide information about the general quality of the
annotations and ontology structure, information that is equally
relevant to any dataset measuring the annotated genes. Given
the large number of proteins with incomplete and
therefore coarse-grained functional annotations, a general meas-
ure of annotation quality may be a poor predictor of how well
annotations will perform within a narrow domain. Even
for those approaches that use experimental data, like the pro-
cess used to create the MSigDB C4 cancer modules, the focus is
usually on a broad collection of experimental data (e.g. micro-
array data for 22 tumor types in the case of the C4 cancer mod-
ules), and the output typically combines synthesis of new
gene sets with gene set refinement rather than focusing solely
on reﬁnement of existing gene sets for a specific experimental
context.

Development of high-quality annotations that are specialized
to a research domain, yet free from researcher bias, requires
techniques that automatically refine annotations using machine
learning methods based on representative experimental data.
While statistical learning methods are commonly used to predict
new annotations from biological data, effective tools are not
currently available that apply these techniques for the refinement
of existing gene set annotations. To address this gap and enable
more accurate and reproducible gene set enrichment analysis, we
have developed a novel bioinformatics method, entropy mini-
mization over variable clusters (EMVC), that automatically cus-
tomizes existing functional annotations for specific sets of
biological data. As we demonstrate using simulated gene sets
with simulated data and MSigDB collections with microarray
gene expression data, the EMVC method accurately ﬁlters an-
notations unrelated to the experimental outcome, resulting in
increased gene set enrichment power and better replication of
enrichment results.

2 METHODS

Our EMVC algorithm reﬁnes gene set annotations to minimize a measure
of entropy between each gene set and clusters of genes computed from
empirical data. Our method takes as input a collection of functional an-
notations of genes and gene products (e.g. gene sets from GO, KEGG or
MSigDB) and a set of experimental data quantifying the abundance of
annotated molecules across multiple experimental conditions. The
method outputs the proportion of gene clusterings, averaged over mul-
tiple bootstrap resampled datasets, in which each annotation belongs to
the minimal entropy solution. Although described in the context of f unc-
tional gene sets and gene expression data, the EMVC method can be used
to optimize any collection of functional annotations given an associated
empirical dataset. Mathematical details of the EMVC method, a simple
illustrative example and speciﬁcs on EMVC evaluation are outlined in the
remainder of this section.

2.1 EMVC algorithm

2.] .1 Inputs The EMVC algorithm takes the following data structures
as input:

0 Matrix of gene product abundance: n x p matrix X quantifying the
abundance of p gene products under n experimental conditions, e.g.
mRNA expression levels measured using microarray technology or
RNA-seq. These data will be modeled as a sample of n independent
observations from a p-dimensional random vector.

XL1  xlm
X: :  : (1)
xn,l  xn,p

where x“ represents the abundance of gene product j under con-
dition i. Although the EMVC algorithm does not have speciﬁc dis-
tributional requirements, sources of genomic data are often well
represented by a multivariate normal distribution
~ N(u1,X1, ZPXP), especially after appropriate transformations. It is
assumed that any desired data transformations (e. g. mean centering,
standardization, log transformation of mRNA expression ratios)
have been performed and that missing values have been imputed
or removed for a complete case analysis.

Matrix of functional annotations: f x p binary annotation matrix A
whose rows represent f different biological functions, e.g. GO cate-
gories or KEGG pathways, and whose cells a“ hold indicator vari-
ables whose value depends on whether an annotation exists between
the function i and gene product j.

01,1 . .. a”,
A =  ' . _  , a“ = 1 [gene product j has function i] (2)

Algorithm parameters: Required parameters include the variable
clustering method (k-means and agglomerative hierarchical cluster-
ing using correlation distance are currently supported), the range of
cluster sizes (km-n to km“) and the number of bootstrap resamples, N.

2.1.2 Entropy measure At the core of our EMVC approach is an
entropy measure computed over functional variable groups relative to
clusters of variables. In the context of gene sets and genomic data, it is
assumed that the p gene products have been divided via a strict partition-
ing into k clusters with the indicator function 1 [gene]- 6 cluster[] repre-
senting the membership state of gene product j within cluster
1,]: 1, ...,k. This clustering can be modeled by f distinct categorical
random variables, Ci, one for each function class deﬁned in the annota-
tion matrix A. Each C,- has k categories and a length-k vector of category-
speciﬁc probabilities CDC!” with elements EPIC". The maximum likelihood
estimate for the <1)ch can be computed as the ratio of the number of
gene products in cluster 1 that are annotated to function i over the total
number of gene products annotated to function i:

ELI a,-,jl [genej E clusterl]
p
2'21 “121'

The maximum likelihood estimate for the entropy (Hausser and
Strimmer, 2009) of each C,- is therefore as follows:

2.1.3 Annotation optimization Given the data matrix X, annota-
tion matrix A and required parameters, the EMVC algorithm
optimizes A using the following core algorithm for a range of k
values on each of N bootstrap resampled versions of X. The average
of all optimized annotation matrices is returned as the ﬁnal output
matrix 0.

Core algorithm:

a Generate K partitional clusters of the p gene products in X using an
algorithm such as k-means clustering or a cut of the dendrogram
produced by agglomerative hierarchical clustering with correlation
distance. Specialized variable clustering methods can also be used,
e.g. the principal component analysis-based methods in the R pack-
age ClustOfVar (Chavent et al., 2012), gene shaving (Hastie et al.,
2000), the varclus method in the R Hmisc package, an R implemen-
tation of the SAS VARCLUS procedure.

a For each functional class i, i = 1, . . . , f whose members are deﬁned
by row vector at, of annotation matrix A, ﬁnd the largest subset of
annotations that minimizes the entropy measure deﬁned in Equation
(4) (i.e. largest minimal entropy subset or LMES). The minimum
entropy value of 0 will be achieved when annotations only exist
for gene products belonging to a single cluster. Although any cluster
with a non-zero number of annotations represents a minimum
entropy subset, the EMVC algorithm selects the largest cluster, cor-
responding to the LMES, to ensure that the fewest annotation
changes are made. If multiple clusters are tied for the largest size,
a random cluster is selected as the largest. In the case that a
functional class has just a single annotation, this annotation will
always be a member of the only non-empty cluster and will therefore
automatically be retained.

o Create the optimized annotation matrix A* by setting
ail. 2 ll [genej e LMES for functional class i].

Smoothing across clusterings:

o Generate A: for k = kmin, ..., kmax.

. Average the A: to create Am. The elements of Am hold the propor-
tion of all variable clusterings in which a particular gene is an elem-
ent of the LMES.

Bootstrap aggregation:

0 Average the AW across N bootstrap resampled datasets to form 0
(Breiman, 1996).

2.1.4 Output The EMVC algorithm outputs the f x p matrix 0 whose
values 0,3]- reﬂect the proportion of variable clusterings over all bootstrap
resampled datasets in which the annotation of gene productj to function i
is kept after entropy minimization.

If an optimized annotation matrix containing binary indicator vari-
ables is desired as output, rather than a matrix of proportions, the
elements of O can be replaced by 0 or 1 according to some desired
threshold. For a speciﬁc threshold, or 6 [0,1], such an f x p matrix T
can be generated as follows:

2.2 Simple example

The following simple example illustrates the basic operation of the
EMVC method. Assume that just two gene sets are deﬁned over ﬁve
gene products as speciﬁed by the following annotation matrix:

1 1 1 0 0
A = [0 0 1 1 1]
Consider the behavior of the EMVC algorithm for the following two
idealized population covariance matrices:

02 e e 0 0 02 e e 0 0
e 02 e 0 0 e 02 e 0 0
21 = e e 02 0 0 .22 = e e 02 e e
0 0 0 02 e 0 0 e 02 e
0 0 0 e 02 0 0 e e 02

When disjoint variable clusters are generated for experimental data
distributed according to 21 with k=2, the cluster assignments will be
{1, 1, 1, 2, 2} with high likelihood, i.e. two variable clusters corresponding
to the block structure in the population covariance matrix. For the gene
set corresponding to the ﬁrst row in A, the estimated entropy given by (4)
is H(C1) = — %10g(%) — glogg) = 0. Because the estimated entropy is al-
ready the minimum possible value, the EMVC algorithm will not make
any changes to the ﬁrst row of A. For the gene set corresponding to the
second row in A, the estimated entropy given by (4) is
H(C2) = —%log(%) — §10g(§) = .637. To achieve a minimum entropy of
0 for this gene set with the fewest annotation changes, the EMVC algo-
rithm eliminates all annotations except those belonging to cluster 2, the
gene cluster with the most genes annotated to this gene set. Overall,
EMVC optimization of A for 21 will result in the following optimized
annotation matrix:

11100
01=T1=[0 0 011]

When disjoint variable clusters are generated for experimental data dis-
tributed according to 22 with k = 2, the cluster assignments will alternate
between {1, 1, 1, 2, 2} and {1, 1, 2, 2, 2} with roughly equal likelihood.
Because the EVMC algorithm averages optimization results across multiple
bootstrap resampled datasets, the optimized matrix 0 will reﬂect the aver-
age of the optimization for these two cluster assignment scenarios:

11.500
02=[00.511]

When the 02 matrix is ﬁltered to generate the binary optimized anno-
tation matrix T2, either of the following can be generated depending on
whether the threshold or is set low or high, respectively:

1110 0 110 0 0
TAM-Fjo 0 1 1 lj’Tz’“>'5=[0 0 0 1 1]

2.3 EMVC evaluation

To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we used the EMVC algo-
rithm to optimize both simulated variable groups for simulated data as
well as MSigDB gene set collections for real gene expression data.
Variable clusters were generated using both k-means clustering and aver-
age-link agglomerative hierarchical clustering with correlation-based
distance. Evaluation was based on the following metrics:

(1) Ability of the EMVC algorithm to ﬁlter inconsistent gene set an-
notations and leave valid annotations unchanged. Assuming the
validity of each annotation is known, this can be quantiﬁed using
contingency table statistics for the output matrix T and can be
represented using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
for the output matrix 0.

(2) Improvement in gene set enrichment power when using the opti-
mized annotations in T versus the unoptimized annotations in A.
This can be quantiﬁed if the identity of gene sets that have a true
association with the output for a given dataset is known.

(3) Improved replication of gene set enrichment results across similar
datasets when using the annotations in T versus A. Although
knowledge of the true enrichment status of each gene set is not
needed to measure replication, multiple datasets are required.

2.3.1 Evaluation using simulated variable groups and simulated
data As a straightforward example, the EMVC algorithm was used
to optimize 20 disjoint variable groups, each composed of annotations
to 15 variables, against twenty-ﬁve 100 x 300 data matrices simulated
according to a multivariate normal distribution ~ MVN(u, Z).
The population covariance matrix, 2, was structured such that all vari-
ables had a variance of 02 = 1 and a correlation among the ﬁrst 5 vari-
ables within the ﬁrst 10 variable groups of p = 0.75. For the ﬁrst 50
observations, i.e. the cases, the mean vector, u, was set to 0 for all vari-
ables except for the ﬁrst 5 variables within variable groups 1, 2, 11 and 12
(the enriched variable groups) for which it was set to 1. For the last 50
observations, i.e. the controls, the mean vector was set to zero, a = 0.
According to this design, only the ﬁrst 5 variables within each of the ﬁrst
10 variable groups represent valid annotations.

EMVC optimization of the simulated variable groups was performed
withoutbootstrapping and using 50 bootstrap resampled datasets. Variable
clusters were created by cutting the dendrogram generated via average-link
agglomerative hierarchical clustering with correlation-based distance,
(1 — r)/2, at k: 10 and at k ranging from 5 to 15. Variable group enrich-
ment false discovery rates (FDR) were computed using the Benjamini and
Hochberg algorithm (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) from two-sided en-
richment P-values generated by the Correlation Adjusted MEan RAnk
(CAMERA) competitive enrichment method (Wu and Smyth, 2012)
using the R implementation in the limma package (Smyth, 2005) with de-
fault settings. Improvement in enrichment replication was quantiﬁed using
Kendall’s coefﬁcient of concordance (Kendall and Smith, 1939), as imple-
mented in the R package irr, across the 25 simulated datasets.

EMVC optimization results for additional simulation scenarios invol-
ving larger sets of overlapping variable groups and the use of k-means
clustering instead of average-link agglomerative hierarchical clustering
with correlation distance can be found in Supplementary File Sl.

2.3.2 Evaluation using MSigDB C2 v1.0 gene sets and p53 gene
expression data The EMVC algorithm was used to optimize the
MSigDB C2 v1.0 gene sets for the p53 gene expression data used in the
2005 GSEA paper (Subramanian et al., 2005). This classic gene set col-
lection and gene expression dataset were selected principally because of
their widespread use in the gene set enrichment literature [e.g. (Efron and
Tibshirani, 2007) and (Subramanian et al., 2005)] and easy accessibility
from the MSigDB repository, factors that will enable other researchers to
more easily interpret and replicate the reported EMVC optimization
results. As a curated gene set collection with experimentally based
annotations, the C2 collection also provides a more meaningful an-
notation optimization challenge than much larger collections such as
GO whose annotations are primarily generated via automated methods
and are therefore less likely on average to align with experimental data.

EMVC optimization was performed using the archived MSigDB C2
v1.0 gene sets and collapsed p53 gene expression data downloaded from
the MSigDB repository. With a minimum gene set size of 15 and max-
imum gene set size of 200, 301 gene sets out of the original 522 were used
in the analysis. The optimized annotation matrix 0 was generated by
executing the EMVC algorithm on 50 bootstrap resampled datasets
drawn from the standardized p53 gene expression data, i.e. each
column was mean centered and scaled to have a standard deviation of
1, with gene clusters generated by k-means clustering for k in the range

of 3715. An optimized version of the C2 gene sets, representing matrix T,
was generated by ﬁltering the optimized annotation matrix 0 at a thresh-
old of 0.1. The enrichment of both optimized and unoptimized C2 gene
sets was computed for the p53 mutated versus wild-type phenotype using
CAMERA (Wu and Smyth, 2012) with default parameters.

Unlike in the simulated data case, where the validity of each annota-
tion was known by design, the consistency of C2 gene set annotations for
the p53 data could only be inferred indirectly. For evaluation of the
EMVC algorithm via contingency table statistics, the designation of
each gene set member by the GSEA algorithm (Subramanian et al.,
2005) as either a core gene or non-core gene with respect to enrichment
against the p53 mutated phenotype was used as a proxy for annotation
validity (e.g. see the detailed results at http://www.broadinstitute.org/
gsea/resources/gsea_pnas_results/p53_C2.Gsea/index.html). Although it
was not possible to directly quantify the change in gene set enrichment
power due to EMVC optimization of the C2 gene sets, the impact was
indirectly examined by comparing the change in enrichment FDR values
between unoptimized and optimized annotations and the unoptimized
enrichment signiﬁcance. Enrichment replication was analyzed using
Kendall’s coefﬁcient of concordance on the enrichment results computed
using optimized annotations over multiple bootstrap resampled datasets,
where these bootstrap datasets used to compute concordance were dis-
tinct from the bootstrap datasets used during annotation optimization.

2.3.3 Evaluation using M SigDB C4 v4.0 cancer modules and leu-
kemia gene expression data The EMVC algorithm was also used to
optimize the MSigDB C4 v4.0 cancer modules for the leukemia gene
expression data (Armstrong et al., 2002) used in the 2005 GSEA paper
(Subramanian et al., 2005). Because the cancer modules (Segal et al.,
2004) were generated by merging and then reﬁning both existing gene
sets drawn from GO, KEGG and the Gene Microarray Pathway Proﬁler
(GenMAPP) (Dahlquist et al., 2002) and gene clusters computed from
1975 gene expression microarrays for 22 tumor types, the cancer modules
should be well aligned with the structure of tumor gene expression data,
making further optimization challenging for a dataset such as the leuke-
mia gene expression data. The automated data-driven process used to
create the cancer modules also provides a useful contrast with the curated
C2 gene sets for the purpose of evaluating the EMVC algorithm.

Similar to testing on the C2 gene sets and p53 data, optimization was
performed using the MSigDB C4 v4.0 cancer modules and collapsed leu-
kemia gene expression data downloaded from the MSigDB repository.
With a minimum gene set size of 15 and maximum gene set size of 200,
297 gene sets of the original 431 were used in the analysis. The optimized
annotation matrix 0 was generated by executing the EMVC algorithm on
50 bootstrap resampled datasets drawn from the standardized leukemia
gene expression data with gene clusters generated by cutting the dendrogran
generated via average-link agglomerative hierarchical clustering with cor-
relation distance at k in the range of 3715. An optimized version of the
cancer modules, representing matrix T, was generated by ﬁltering the opti-
mized annotation matrix 0 at a threshold of 0.15. The enrichment of both
optimized and unoptimized cancer modules was computed for the acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) versus acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
phenotypes using CAMERA (Wu and Smyth, 2012).

The computation of contingency table statistics, analysis of enrichment
power and quantiﬁcation of enrichment replication were performed for
the cancer modules and leukemia data using the same methods employed
for the C2 gene sets and p53 data (see Section 2.3.2 above).

strap resampled datasets. Figure 1b is additionally restricted to
just a single number of clusters, in this case 5. Figure 1d illus-

cluster sizes from 5 to 15 and 50 bootstrap resampled datasets.
Figure 1e and f show two versions of the filtered output matrix T
for thresholds of 0.1 and 0.9, respectively.

For the simulation procedure outlined in Section 2.3.1, the
EMVC algorithm filtered inconsistent annotations with high
accuracy when applied to a range of cluster sizes and multiple
bootstrap resampled datasets. The mean area under curve
(AUC) over all 25 simulated datasets was 0.995. When just a
single cluster size was used or bootstrapping was not used,
EMVC performance declined. The mean AUC for no bootstrap-
ping and k = 10 was 0.912, for all cluster sizes and no bootstrap-
ping the mean AUC was 0.941, and for 50 bootstrap datasets
and k: 5 the mean AUC was 0.993.

group enrichment FDR computed using CAMERA (Wu and
Smyth, 2012) for each of the 20 variable groups using both
unoptimized and optimized annotations. Based on the simula-
tion design, only variable groups 1, 2, 11 and 12 should have
significant FDR values because only these variable groups in-
clude variables that have a true association with the simulated
binary phenotype. Although the EMVC algorithm filters many
uncorrelated variables from the first 10 variable groups, enrich-
ment using both unoptimized and optimized annotations results
in insigniﬁcant FDR values for all truly non-enriched variable
groups. The enrichment FDR values for unenriched variable
groups are therefore not impacted by EMVC ﬁltering of uncor-
related variables. As shown by the ﬁgure, enrichment power for
this example is substantially improved after EMVC-based anno-
tation optimization with the mean power to detect the truly en-
riched variable groups at a q-value of 51, changing from 0.63 for
unoptimized annotations to 0.79 for optimized annotations.

Impact on enrichment replication. EMVC-optimized annota-
tions also improved the replication of enrichment results, as
measured by Kendall’s coefﬁcient of concordance across the 25
independently simpulated datasets. Using unoptimized annota-
tions, Kendall’s W for the enrichment FDR values across the 25
simulated datasets was 0.486. Using optimized annotations,
Kendall’s W was 0.507.

Fig. 3. Enrichment and annotation optimization results for the MSigDB C2 v1.0 gene sets and p53 data used in the 2005 GSEA paper (Subramanian
et al., 2005). The ﬁgure shows the difference between enrichment FDR computed using unoptimized and optimized annotations for the 15 C2 gene sets
with the lowest unoptimized enrichment P-values. Enrichment FDRs were computed using the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm on two-sided P-
values generated by the enrichment method CAMERA (Wu and Smyth, 2012). Open circles represent the FDR values computed using the unoptimized
gene sets annotations, and solid squares represent the FDR values computed using optimized annotations. If the optimized FDR value is less than the
unoptimized value, a solid line is used, otherwise, a dotted line is used. A WT preﬁx is used for gene sets enriched using the unoptimized annotations for
the wild-type phenotype, and a MUT preﬁx is used for gene sets enriched for the mutated phenotype. The ratio of optimized to unoptimized annotations
for each of the top 15 gene sets is displayed after each gene set name along with the symbols for the ﬁltered genes. An asterisk follows the symbol for
ﬁltered annotations that were designated as core genes by the GSEA algorithm. The contingency table in the bottom right comer displays the association
between EMVC annotation ﬁltering and whether each annotation was designated as a core or non-core gene by the GSEA algorithm with respect to
enrichment against the WT versus MUT phenotype. For the displayed contingency table, ﬁltered annotations were removed by EMVC in more 90% of
the cluster results in 50 bootstrap resampled datasets resulting in an odds ratio of 9.38 (95% CI: 2.23784). When all ﬁltering thresholds are considered,

the area under the ROC curve is 0.67

and genes that were designated as core or non-core by GSEA for
these 15 gene sets. In terms of the desired behavior of the EMVC
algorithm, non-core genes can be Viewed as true positives, i.e.
annotations that should be removed. As demonstrated by the
significant odds ratio of 9.38 (95% CI: 2.23784) and area
under the ROC curve of 0.67 for all annotation ﬁltering thresh-
olds, the EMVC algorithm effectively removed C2 annotations
for genes that do not contribute to the mutated versus wild-type
phenotype in the p53 data.

Impact on enrichment power. As illustrated in Figure 3, EMVC
optimization resulted in an improvement in enrichment FDR
values for 13 of the 15 most significant gene sets. As demon-
strated by the association between EMVC annotation ﬁltering
and the GSEA core versus non-core designation, this improve-
ment in enrichment FDR values was primarily due to the pref-
erential removal of annotations for genes with either a small
association with the outcome or with an association that was
the opposite from the overall direction of enrichment of the
gene set. Across all 301 tested C2 gene sets, the improvement
in the enrichment FDR after EMVC optimization was positively
correlated with the original enrichment signiﬁcance of the gene
set, i.e. gene sets with signiﬁcant enrichment values using the
unoptimized annotations were most likely to beneﬁt from opti-
mization. This association was demonstrated by a Spearman
correlation between unoptimized enrichment FDR values and
the ratio of optimized to unoptimized enrichment FDR values

of 0.261 (P-Value: 4.39e-06). The Spearman correlation between
the unoptimized enrichment FDR and the proportion of ﬁltered
gene set annotations was —0.0309 (P-Value: 0.594). The fact that
the proportion of gene set annotations ﬁltered during optimization
was unassociated with gene set enrichment signiﬁcance demon-
strates that this positive correlation was not the result of prefer-
ential annotation ﬁltering for signiﬁcantly enriched gene sets.

Impact on enrichment replication. EMVC optimization also
had a positive impact on gene set enrichment replication, as
measured by Kendall’s coefﬁcient of concordance on the enrich-
ment P—Values across multiple bootstrap resampled datasets.
Using the unoptimized annotations, Kendall’s W for the enrich-
ment P-Values values of the C2 gene sets relative to the p53
mutated and wild-type phenotypes on 20 bootstrap resampled
p53 datasets was 0.372. Using the optimized annotations,
Kendall’s W was 0.384.

tion optimization and CAMERA gene set enrichment can be

Fig. 4. Enrichment and annotation optimization results for the MSigDB C4 v4.0 cancer modules and leukemia gene expression data (Armstrong et al.,
2002). The ﬁgure shows the difference between enrichment FDR computed using unoptimized and optimized annotations for the 15 cancer modules with
the lowest unoptimized enrichment P-values. Enrichment FDRs were computed using the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm on two-sided P-values
generated by CAMERA (Wu and Smyth, 2012). Open circles represent the FDR values computed using the unoptimized cancer module annotations,
and solid squares represent the FDR values computed using optimized cancer modules. If the optimized FDR value is less than the unoptimized value, a
solid line is used, otherwise, a dotted line is used. An AML preﬁx is used for gene sets enriched using the unoptimized annotations for the acute myeloid
leukemia, and an ALL preﬁx is used for gene sets enriched for the acute lymphoblastic leukemia phenotype. The ratio of optimized to unoptimized
annotations for each of the top 15 cancer modules is displayed after each module name along with the symbols for the ﬁltered genes (cropped at 7). An
asterisk follows the symbol for ﬁltered annotations that were designated as core genes by the GSEA algorithm. For the displayed contingency table,
ﬁltered annotations were removed by EMVC in more 85% of the cluster results in 50 bootstrap resampled data sets resulting in an odds ratio of 41.1
(95% CI: 21.8786). When all ﬁltering thresholds are considered, the area under the ROC curve is 0.92

non-core with respect to enrichment against the AML versus
ALL phenotype. Similar to Figure 3, Figure 4 shows the
impact of EMVC optimization on the 15 cancer modules with
the lowest enrichment P-Values. The contingency table embedded
in the lower right corner of this ﬁgure holds the results of the
overlap between EMVC ﬁltered genes and GSEA core or non-
core genes for the 15 most enriched cancer modules. As demon-
strated by the signiﬁcant odds ratio of 41.1 (95% CI: 21.8786)
and area under the ROC curve of 0.92 for all annotation filtering
thresholds, the EMVC algorithm effectively removed C4 cancer
module annotations for genes that do not contribute to the AML
versus ALL phenotype.

Impact on enrichment power. As illustrated in Figure 4, EMVC
optimization resulted in an improvement in enrichment FDR
values for all 15 most signiﬁcantly enriched cancer modules.
The Spearman correlation between the unoptimized enrichment
FDR and the ratio of optimized enrichment FDR to unopti-
mized enrichment FDR was 0.755 (P-Value: 4.78e-56), while
the Spearman correlation between the unoptimized enrichment
FDR and the proportion of filtered annotations was 0.277 (P-
value: 1.2e-06).

Impact on enrichment replication. Using the unoptimized an-
notations, Kendall’s W for the enrichment P-Values of the cancer
modules relative to the AML versus ALL phenotypes on 20
bootstrap resampled leukemia datasets was 0.889. Using the
optimized annotations, Kendall’s W was 0.934.

Detailed results. Complete output from both EMVC annota-
tion optimization and CAMERA gene set enrichment can be

4 DISCUSSION

Gene clusters and gene set enrichment. The EMVC algorithm
performs annotation optimization on variable clusters computed
using an unsupervised View of experimental data. By minimizing
the entropy for each variable group relative to disjoint variable
clusters, the annotations for variables that tend to cluster with
other variable group members are kept and annotations for vari-
ables that cluster apart are ﬁltered. A key advantage of this un-
supervised approach is that EMVC-optimized annotations can
be used for subsequent variable group enrichment without bias-
ing the computed enrichment statistics. However, the unsuper-
vised EMVC approach can only successfully filter inconsistent
annotations, improve gene set enrichment power and improve
enrichment replication if the structure of genomic data, as rep-
resented by gene clusters, can be used to identify the genomic
variables most likely to contribute to gene set enrichment. In
other words, the genes that contribute strongly to the enrichment
signal for signiﬁcantly enriched gene sets must be more likely to
cluster together than the genes whose expression is not consistent
with gene set enrichment.

EMVC

 

In the simulation example outlined in Section 3.1, such a re-
lationship between variable group enrichment and inter-variable
correlation was explicitly created for the ﬁrst five variables in the
ﬁrst two variable groups with the predictable result that these
variables were not filtered by EMVC and significantly lower en-
richment FDR values were obtained using optimized annota-
tions. The results in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 provide important
conﬁrmation that this association between gene set enrichment
and gene clustering exists in real microarray gene expression data
in the context of curated and automatic MSigDB gene sets. This
is most clearly demonstrated by the strong relationship between
EMVC annotation ﬁltering and the designation of gene set an-
notations by the GSEA enrichment algorithm as either core or
non-core genes.

Optimal number of gene clusters and use of bootstrap
aggregation. Because the true number of clusters for experimen-
tal datasets is unknown and cluster size estimation methods such
as the gap statistic (Tibshirani et al., 2001) or silhouette width
(Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 2005) are often unreliable, the
EMVC algorithm is executed on multiple variable clusterings
where the number of clusters varies over a speciﬁed range. One
potential enhancement of the EMVC method would be use of
results from a method such as the gap statistic to weight the
EMVC optimization results for each clustering in the speciﬁed
range. Bootstrap aggregation is further used to reduce the vari-
ance of the annotation optimization estimates (Breiman, 1996;
Hastie et al., 2009). Averaging over multiple clusterings for mul-
tiple bootstrap resampled datasets provides a robust optimiza-
tion result that is not dependent on a speciﬁc estimate of the
optimal number of variable clusters. As demonstrated by the
simulation example in Section 3.1, this can have a signiﬁcant
impact on optimization performance. The importance of com-
puting information-theoretic measures over a range of cluster
sizes has also been highlighted in the paper describing the re-
cently developed maximal information coefﬁcient method
(Reshef et al., 2011).

Using EMVC to analyze speciﬁc genomic datasets. One of the
primary applications of the EMVC algorithm involves the opti-
mization of a gene set collection for a speciﬁc genomic dataset
before enrichment analysis. For this application, it is desirable to
perform enrichment analysis against existing gene set categories
that have been modiﬁed to only contain annotations consistent
with the narrow domain under investigation. By using standard
gene sets and only allowing the removal of annotations, the
computed enrichment results can be directly interpreted in
terms of widely known and well understood genomic functions.
Such direct and easy interpretation is not possible if annotations
are added or if new novel gene sets are derived. The fact that the
EMVC algorithm uses an unsupervised View of the data to just
ﬁlter annotations from existing gene sets therefore makes it well
suited for this use case. Additional beneﬁts of the EMVC
algorithm in this scenario include the ability to use optimization
proportions, rather than ﬁltered annotations based on a
threshold, directly with enrichment methods that support
annotation weights [e.g. ProbCD (V encio and Shmulevich,
2007)], and ﬂexibility regarding the algorithm used to cluster
genes.

Using EMVC to reﬁne gene set collections. The EMVC method
can also be used for the general refinement of gene set

collections, either to create versions of a gene set collection
that are customized for a speciﬁc domain or to identify and en-
tirely remove annotations that exhibit poor alignment with a
broad selection of genomic datasets. For both variants of this
use case, the EMVC algorithm would be used to optimize a gene
set collection for a large number of individual datasets. For the
ﬁrst variant, the average optimization proportions generated
across all target datasets could be used by researchers to create
customized versions of the gene set collection at any desired level
of conﬁdence. For this application, the ease with which the
EMVC algorithm can be parallelized, at the level of different
clusterings or different bootstrap resampled datasets, is a major
benefit.

EMVC Limitations. Limitations of the EMVC algorithm in-
clude the restriction to annotation removal, computational com-
plexity, dependence on gene clustering structure and sensitivity to
algorithm parameter settings.

0 The EMVC algorithm will only remove potentially incon-
sistent annotations to a gene set. It will not augment incom-
plete gene sets or identify new gene sets.

0 If gene set members associated with the clinical outcome fail
to cluster together, EMVC annotation optimization will not
improve gene set enrichment.

o EMVC performance is sensitive to several algorithm param-
eters. Speciﬁcally, the cluster method, k range and ﬁltering
threshold must be appropriate for the structure of the ex-
perimental data in X and annotations in A.

o EMVC can be computationally expensive. This is especially
true for large genomic datasets and correspondingly large
gene sets collections with the k range and number of boot-
strap resamples needed to generate stable optimization
results.

5 CONCLUSION

Gene set enrichment has become a central element in the
analysis and interpretation of genomic data. Although signiﬁ-
cant progress has been made building gene set collections and
developing statistical enrichment methods, annotation qual-
ity remains a critical challenge. Because of the broad scope of
many gene set collections and the large number of low-
quality annotations, enrichment analysis results are frequently
inaccurate and non-reproducible. Current approaches to
annotation quality are mainly general purpose, largely driven
by just the structure and content of the gene set ontology and,
when experimental data are considered, focus on gene set
synthesis over refinement. To address the annotation quality
issue and limitations of current approaches, we have developed
a novel annotation optimization method, EMVC, which is
available as an R package from CRAN. On both simulated
gene sets with simulated data and MSigDB gene sets with
real gene expression data, the EMVC algorithm has
been shown to effectively ﬁlter inconsistent annota-
tions, improve enrichment power and improve enrichment
replication.

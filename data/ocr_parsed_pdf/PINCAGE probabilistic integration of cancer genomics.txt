Abstract

Motivation: Cancer development and progression is driven by a complex pattern of genomic and
epigenomic perturbations. Both types of perturbations can affect gene expression levels and dis—
ease outcome. lntegrative analysis of cancer genomics data may therefore improve detection of
perturbed genes and prediction of disease state. As different data types are usually dependent,
analysis based on independence assumptions will make inefficient use of the data and potentially
lead to false conclusions.

Model: Here, we present PINCAGE (Probabilistic INtegration of CAncer GEnomics data), a method
that uses probabilistic integration of cancer genomics data for combined evaluation of RNA—seq
gene expression and 450k array DNA methylation measurements of promoters as well as gene
bodies. It models the dependence between expression and methylation using modular graphical
models, which also allows future inclusion of additional data types.

Results: We apply our approach to a Breast Invasive Carcinoma dataset from The Cancer Genome
Atlas consortium, which includes 82 adjacent normal and 730 cancer samples. We identify new
biomarker candidates of breast cancer development (PTF1A, RABIF, RAGIAP1, TIMM17A,
LOC148145) and progression (SERPINE3, ZNF706). PINCAGE discriminates better between normal
and tumour tissue and between progressing and non—progressing tumours in comparison with es—
tablished methods that assume independence between tested data types, especially when using
evidence from multiple genes. Our method can be applied to any type of cancer or, more generally,
to any genomic disease for which sufficient amount of molecular data is available.

1 Introduction

Cancer genomics aims to improve patient diagnosis, prognosis and
treatment opportunities. Identification and optimal use of molecular
biomarkers is key to achieve this, as they may allow for stratification
of clinically relevant cancer subtypes and prediction of clinical

outcome. Individual molecular markers of different types have long
been used in the cancer field, however, their predictive performance
is often limited (Ray et (11., 2014), which may at least in part be
explained by tumour molecular heterogeneity (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). Combined use of multiple markers of different

the implementation and speeds up likelihood calculations. The
model implementation therefore relies on discretization of the con—
tinuous random variables. The discretization scheme is separately
defined for each variable within each gene model based on all train—
ing samples: first, continuous kernel—smoothed overall densities
were inferred, and second, 25 bins were defined, each spanning four
percentiles.

In this setup, inferred distributions of regional methylation, ex—
pression or methylation given expression become multinomial distri—
butions with parameters specified using grid Gaussian kernels as
implemented in the AWS (Polzehl and Spokoiny, 2006) and
smoothie (Gilleland, 2013) R packages (see Supplementary data:
PLK1 example of training process and Fig. S3). We use kernels to
smooth the fine—grained discrete probability distributions and to pre—
vent overfitting. The training process can be described as smoothing
of the evidence across the grid representing the discretized condi—
tional probability distribution table. The training therefore depends
on the smoothing parameter which we calculate per gene using a
heuristic scheme (optimized based on simulation studies, formula
and kernel given in Supplementary Equations 51 and 52) that ties it
to the number of available data points and to the resolution of the
discretization. The smoothing parameter was selected to strike the
right balance between overfitting and discriminatory power.
Generally, increasing its value will lower the variance of the predic—
tions and protect from overfitting, while lowering its value may lead
to overfitting, especially when the training data are insufficient given
model complexity. The discretized versions of the joint probability
distributions sum, rather than integrate, out the unobserved random

where dE is the number of bins used to discretize normalized expres—
sion, dP and alle are the numbers of bins used to discretize promoter
and gene body methylation states, respectively.

The non—parametric form of the distributions allows them to
capture the potentially multi—modal and highly variable methylation
and expression distributions seen for cancer samples (Fig. 2, cumula—
tively shown in Fig. 43). For a given gene, cancer samples often
show much heterogeneity, with some behaving like normal tissue

while others are perturbed in various ways (Supplementary Fig. S8,
examples of RNASEH2A, TMEM63B, PLK1 and RABIF, amongst
many others). This approach also allows us to capture the often
complex, non—linear and highly gene—specific relationships between
gene expression and methylation (Supplementary Fig. S8,
RAG1AP1, CPA1, PLK1).

2.3 Applications

2.3.1 Evaluation of the degree of perturbation

We evaluate the degree of perturbation of expression—, methyla—
tion— or joint expression and methylation using a modified likeli—
hood ratio test procedure (Neyman, 1933). Consider a calculation
of the D statistic in a comparison between AN and tumour groups

(Gr.):
D :
P(Dg : dg.[TuAN])nullg)

P(Dg : dng modelg)*P(Gr. : T)
+P(Dg : ngANjAN modelg)*P(Gr. : AN)

— 2ln

 

The T and AN gene models are trained using only tumour
or only AN samples, respectively. The prior probability would typ—
ically reflect the expected proportion of normal samples P
(Gr. : AN) versus the proportion of tumour samples P(Gr. : T).
However, we only supply uniform priors in our applications. The
null model is trained using samples from both groups. Due to vari—
able number of CpG sites for each gene, raw values of the D statistic
cannot be directly compared across the genome. Hence, we normal—
ize the value of the D statistic using its random expectation obtained
by permuting sample labels:

(13)

The final genome—wide ranking of gene perturbations is
based on Z—scores. Although some tumours are paired with AN
tissue (11 : 82), we ignore this pairing to facilitate inclusion of the
majority of tumours without the AN counterpart (n : 682). In
this way we can better evaluate the degree of heterogeneity of the
tumour group and apply the approach to unpaired datasets.

2.3.2 Classification of sample‘s group label—use in clinics

Here, we show how our model can be used to predict which group
label is the most probable for a given sample (tumour versus normal,
progressing versus non—progressing, etc.). For instance, to classify a
given sample as either tumour or AN, we evaluate the likelihood of its
data (Dg,S : dgs) using both the T model and AN model and evaluate
the posterior probabilities of belonging to either group:
P(Gr. : TIDgS : dgﬁ) and P(Gr. : TIDgS : dgﬁ) (Eqs. 10 and 11).

P(Gr. : TIDg.S : dgs)
i P(Dgs : dgng modelg)*P(C : T) (14)
_ P(Dgs : dgng modelg)*P(Gr. : T)

+ P(Dg, : dgslAN modelg)*P(Gr. : AN)

 

P(Gr. : ANngS : dgs) : 1 — P(Gr. : T(Dg,, : dgs) (15)

Furthermore, we may combine the evidence from several genes
to improve classification performance. Given a set of selected candi—
date genes (G), we implement this using a naive Bayes classifier and
thus assume independence between genes:

P(Gr. : ANID[G].S : d[G].S) : 1 — P(Gr. : TID[G].S : d[G].S) (17)

In this case, T modeljcj and AN modeljcj are sets of selected
gene models. We later construct naive Bayes classifiers using running
combinations of most significant genes.

2.4 Time complexity

The likelihood evaluation of the integrative model dominates the
time usage (Eqn. 11). For each gene, it is linear in the number of
samples (n), the number of bins used to discretize expression (dB),
the number of CpG sites (111) + nGB), and the number of bins used to
discretize the methylation levels (dP and dGB):

T(n) : O(n dE(nPdP + nGBdGB)). (18)

The Z—score evaluations are much more time—consuming than
the final classification, as the likelihood evaluations are per—
formed across the dataset for each the permutations
(nperm : 100). The actual run—time therefore depends on the size
of the dataset and the number of bins used for discretization
(dEzdpszB :25). For the BRCA dataset, with 17 728 genes
evaluated across 487 tumours and 55 normals, the total runtime
of the significance evaluations were 5400 CPU core hours on Intel
E5—2670 processors. The median runtime for a single gene was
~16 min. For the smaller progression set (11 : 71), the median
runtime was 4.5 min per gene. The classification for selected can—
didates is ~2 orders or magnitude faster than the significance
evaluation.

2.5 Comparison to existing methods

We compared PINCAGE’s performance with established methods
within differential methylation, gene expression analyses and classi—
fication tasks. For differential expression analysis, we compare with
the edgeR algorithm using tag—wise dispersion (Robinson et al.,
2010). For the differential methylation analysis, we compare with
Welch’s t—test (Welch, 1947) applied to the mean methylation levels
across all Cst within promoters or gene bodies. The widely used
limma method (Smyth, 2005) does not apply to our simulated data—
set as it learns and uses a prior on the observed variance and is there—
fore not used.

For independent combination of the individual data types, we
use Fisher’s method (Fisher, 1938), which we apply to independently
combine both the established methods and PINCAGE sub—models.
When we below refer to combinations of methods/models we always
mean the combination with the Fisher’s method. We control the
false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini and Hochberg pro—
cedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) in the differential analysis
of expression, methylation or joint expression and methylation data
across all genes.

For sample classification, we primarily compare against the LR
(McCullagh and Nelder, 1998). For the progression set analysis,
which is based on smaller sample set and is generally a much harder
problem, we additionally compare against Random Forests (Liaw,
2002) and Bayesian LR (Bayesian LR) (Gelman, 2015). These ML
methods were identified as the best performing multi—modal uniform
classifiers in a range of different cancer—related tasks including recur—
rence and survival (Ray et al., 2014). We use the normalized gene

expression (RPM), and overall regional GB and promoter methyla—
tion levels as predictors for the ML methods. LR classifiers were
built without any interaction terms. Classifiers involving multiple
genes include sets of gene—specific expression and overall methyla—
tion predictors. Optimal tuning hyper—parameters for the different
ML methods were found using grid search via the caret package
(Kuhn, 2015). Final ML models were trained using bootstrapping
with 25 repetitions.

3 Results

3.1 Overview of DNA methylation and gene expression
in breast cancer

We first characterized the breast cancer methylation and expression
profiles across all genes using the BRCA dataset to motivate the
model design choices. A central aim was to evaluate the degree of
correlation between promoter or gene body methylation and expres—
sion for each gene and the degree of variability of tumours compared
with normals.

We first looked at the global distributions of the three data
types. The overall expression profiles of tumours and AN samples
were similar, though tumours showed a relative increase in the
number of lowly expressed genes (Fig. 4A, 1.25 X more genes with
RPM 3 1). The distribution of methylation levels across promoters
was bimodal: some were highly methylated, though the majority
were lowly methylated. More highly methylated promoters (M—
value > 2/Beta—value > 0.8) are seen for normal samples (16.4%)
than for tumour samples (13.8%). Consistent with existing obser—
vations of cancerous hypermethylation of the normally unmethy—
lated promoters (Yang et al., 2010), moderately methylated
promoters (M—value > —1 86 < 1/Beta—value > 0.33 86 < 0.67)
were more abundant among tumours (16.1%) than normals
(12.9%). The distribution of gene body methylation is unimodal,
with a large fraction of highly methylated genes, though also here,
high methylation levels are more common for ANs (44.4%) than
for tumours (40.2%).

Even if the mean level of a data type for a gene is not per—
turbed between tumours and ANs, the amount of variation across
individual samples may still differ. To characterize the frequency
and strength of this, we evaluated the ratio between the standard
deviation of the tumour sample set and the AN sample set for
each gene. Consistent with previous reports in various cancer
types (Hinoue et al., 2012; Wyatt et al., 2014), all three data
types show significantly higher variation in the tumour samples
than in the AN samples (Fig. 43). We defined 5% significance
levels using genome—wide random expectation (Supplementary
Fig. 52A) by repeatedly (n : 10) permuting sample labels gen—
ome—wide. Significantly increased variability in tumours com—
pared with normals was more often seen for the methylation data
types (71.3% of gene bodies and 58.5% of promoters) than ex—
pression (12.9%).

We next evaluated the gene—specific correlation of promoter
and gene body methylation with expression (Fig. 4C) to further
motivate separation of these relationships. Gene body methylation
was primarily negatively correlated with expression in the ANS
(57.9% of genes), which contrasts the generalization from most
studies (Yang et al., 2014). Promoter methylation was also primar—
ily negatively correlated with expression (69.3% of genes), which
is in agreement with the existing paradigm (Yang et al., 2010). In
both cases, however, much variation in direction of correlation
existed, with no general rule, though tumours generally showed

less extreme levels of correlation between methylation and expres-
sion than AN samples.

We further quantified the significant fraction of gene-specific
expression-methylation correlations at 5% significance levels
(Fig. 4C) using the group-specific random expectations
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). The significant fractions of gene ex-
pression correlation with promoter and gene body methylation
were generally larger in AN samples (26.1% of gene bodies,
22.4% of promoters) than in tumours (19.7% and 18.4%, re-
spectively). There was also a significant fraction of negatively cor-
related methylation of gene bodies and promoters with gene
expression, though smaller than of the positively correlated in
both tumours (7.8% and 9.8%, respectively) and normals (12.3%
and 8.49%, respectively).

We finally looked at the per-gene differences in methylation to
expression correlation between the tumour and AN groups (Fig.
4D). More genes show significant positive correlation changes than
expected by random (Supplementary Fig. S2C) across both methyla-
tion types (27.0% of gene bodies and 24.9% of promoters), which is
in agreement with the average trend across genes (Fig. 4C). To a
smaller degree, albeit still significant, negative shifts are also seen
for some gene bodies (11.7%) and promoters (7.4%).

Correlation of expression and methylation signals and variation
in the strength of these correlations suggest joint, adaptive analysis
of the three data types to be important. Also, the heterogeneity of
the cancer cohort suggests use of flexible and multi-modal distribu-
tions for modelling individual variables and the relationships be-
tween them.

3.2 Simulated data

We initially explored PINCAGE’s performance under different con-
ditions using artificially generated datasets as follows. We first simu-
lated datasets under a range of conditions and then evaluated the
ability to detect genes perturbed in tumour using the significance
evaluation procedure described above (Eqs. 8 and 9). The overall
performance was quantified using the Area Under the receiver oper-
ating characteristic Curve (AUC). Each dataset consisted of an equal
number (n : 100) of tumour and normal samples with values for all
three data types simulated for 2,000 genes (Supplementary data:
Simulation procedure description). The parameters of the simulation
(Supplementary Table S1) were chosen to resemble the values
observed for the BRCA dataset (Fig. 4).

We first asked how the detection of perturbed genes changed if
only a fraction of the tumour samples were truly perturbed, to evalu-
ate the effect of inter-tumour heterogeneity on individual and joint
analyses using PINCAGE and established methods (Supplementary
data: Evaluation of heterogeneity simulated datasets). The perform-
ance was both better initially when the signal is the purest and
degraded more slowly as the fraction of perturbed tumour samples
decreases (Supplementary Fig. S4). We attributed PINCAGE’s
greater robustness to tumour sample heterogeneity in this setting to
its ability to model the resulting multi-modal distributions.

We next explored the effect of modelling the dependencies be-
tween the data types as done in the integrative model. For this, we
simulated a separate series of datasets with constant levels of correl-
ation between expression and methylation in the normal samples
and varying levels in the tumours, as seen in the BRCA dataset
(Fig. 4C and D). The joint analysis using the integrative PINCAGE
model recovers more signal than combining either the established
methods or individual data type models throughout in this setting
(Fig. 5). As the difference in correlation levels increase between

tive model increases over the combination of individual data type
tests.

3.3 Gene perturbation between BRCA tumours

and normals

We next used PINCAGE to detect perturbed genes across all genes
of the BRCA dataset. We withheld one-third of the data (validation)
for later evaluation of the discriminatory power of the identified
genes. The remaining two-thirds (training) were used to contrast tu-
mour (n : 487) samples with AN samples (n : 55) using the inte-
grative PINCAGE model, the individual PINCAGE sub-models, and
the established methods. The vast majority of genes (>91%) were
found to be significantly altered at 1% FDR when including all three
data types by combination of the established methods (n : 16 805).
This showed that most genes were perturbed in at least one data
type in the BRCA set.

We next asked if known sets of cancer genes ranked differently
between the P—value ordered gene lists generated with the combin-
ation of established methods and PINCAGE Z—scores
(Supplementary Fig. S6). We evaluated the set of candidate genes
from the original TCGA study of the BRCA set (Cancer Genome
Atlas Network, 2012); a general set of cancer driver genes
(Vogelstein et al., 2013), and the set of COSMIC driver genes
(Forbes et al., 2008). No set showed a significant bias toward the
most significant/perturbed genes by either method (Supplementary
Table S2). However, the combination of established methods
showed marginally stronger association of COSMIC and Vogelstein
et al. genes towards low ranks (P—values of 0.3294 and 0.3296, one-
sided Wilcoxon rank sum test) than integrative PINCAGE (P—values
of 0.7358 and 0.8493). The differences between methods, however,
were insignificant (P-values of 0.7661 and 0.8425, Mann—Whitney
test). This suggests that many more genes are jointly more perturbed
than those in the driver gene sets.

We finally evaluated the overall Spearman correlation of gene
ranks from the different methods. For the PINCAGE sub-models
compared with the established methods on individual data types, the
correlation was highest for gene expression (cor : 0.731), with gene
body (cor :0 .576) and promoter (cor : 0.542) methylation being
at similar levels (Supplementary Fig. S5). Upon combination of all
three data types, the ranking between methods became more con-
cordant, with the combination of the established methods showing
similar levels of correlation as the integrative PINCAGE model
(cor: 0. 742; Supplementary Fig. S6) and the combination of

individual PINCAGE sub—models (cor : 0.747; Supplementary
Fig. S7A). The analysis using integrative PINCAGE correlated
strongly with the combination of PINCAGE sub—models (cor:0.
868; Supplementary Fig. S7B). The three compared integrative
methods generally agree on the overall ranking but differences are
apparent. These differences are likely caused by incorporation of
dependencies and allowing for multimodality by the PINCAGE
models.

3.3. 1 Top-ranked candidates

Among the top—10 ranked candidates from the integrative
PINCAGE model (Table 1), we found that five had been linked to
breast cancer previously: CPA1, NEK2, RNASEH2A, TIMM17A
and PLK1 (references in Supplementary Table S3). Marginal distri—
butions of the PLK1 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary S8, PLK1) show pro—
nounced changes between disease groups. Also, patterns of
differential correlation were seen between groups.

Three additional genes from the top—10 had been associated with
other types of cancers. The RABIF gene regulates the Rab family of
proteins involved in cancer cell motility (Tang and Ng, 2009). The
PTF1A encodes the subunit alpha of pancreas transcription factor 1,
which is involved in cell fate determination in various organs
(Sellick et al., 2004) and is causally implicated in exocrine pancre—
atic cancer (Adell et al., 2000). Although the expression of PTF1A is
lost in exocrine pancreatic cancer and is unexpressed in breast tissue,
we observed an activation of transcription of this gene in some of
the BRCA tumour samples (Supplementary Fig. S8, PTF1A
Expression). It is highly differentially methylated in both promoter
and GB regions (P—values of 2.18e—29 and 4.56e—34; Welch’s t—test),
though these changes appear uncorrelated with status of expression
changes. Finally, the RAG1AP1 encodes transporter SWEET1 that
mediates sugar transport across membranes (Chen et al., 2010).
GLUT1, another sugar transporter, was previously found upregu—
lated and substantially increasing glucose uptake into cytoplasm in
many cancers (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011), contributing to one
of the hallmarks of cancer, the Warburg effect (Kim and Dang,
2006). We saw the same pattern of up—regulation in BRCA with the

RAG1AP1 (Supplementary Fig. S8; RAG1AP1, P-value:2.44e—77,
edgeR) and speculate its similar role in the Warburg effect.

The final two genes are poorly characterized: TMEM63B
encodes Transmembrane Protein 63B (differentially expressed,
P—value:1.95e—64, edgeR), and, interestingly, LOC148145 is a non—
protein—coding gene, encoding lincRNA 906 that is very lowly, yet
differentially expressed (P-value:1.70e—40, edgeR) and highly
methylated in BRCA tumour samples (P—values of 1.81e—38 and
3.87e—73 for promoter and GB, Welch’s t—test).

3.3.2 Classification of tumour versus normal

We explored PINCAGE’s classification performance on the top—10
most significant genes and compared it against that of LR using the
same set of genes or using genes identified with combination of es—
tablished methods. We evaluated the methods using the set—aside ad—
jacent normal (n : 27) and tumour (n : 243) samples and report
AUCs for both individual genes and their running combinations
(Table 1; right—hand side). For individual genes, the performance
varies and neither PINCAGE nor LR models are consistently best in
the top—10 (3 versus 7, respectively).

Upon combination of signals across genes using the naive Bayes
approach for integrative PINCAGE models (Eqs. 12 and 13), the
performance remains very high (AUCz0.998) and stable after AUC
saturation at the fifth gene. When signals across multiple genes are
combined, the PINCAGE classifiers showed better performance
than the LR models that had fluctuating AUCs.

For comparison, we also evaluated LR models using the top—10
most significant genes according to the combination of established
methods (Supplementary Table S4). Several genes among the top—
10 are of relevance to breast cancer (references in Supplementary
Table S5), however, their ranking is primarily driven by changes in
gene expression between cancers and AN samples, rather than by
joint expression—methylation gene perturbation (Supplementary
Fig. S9). The resulting individual gene classifiers show similar clas—
sification performance as the LR classifiers produced using the
top—10 genes from the PINCAGE ranking.

3.4 Gene perturbation between BRCA progressed

and non—progressed tumours

We next applied PINCAGE to the more challenging problem of dis—
criminating between progressing and non—progressing tumours. In
the BRCA set, we used occurrence of a new tumour after initial
treatment (recurrence) as a proxy for disease progression. Tumour
samples were dichotomized into progressing (n : 14) and non—pro—
gressing (n : 57) based on presence or absence of recurrence within
close to 3 years (1065 days) of initial treatment (Supplementary
Table 510). This time threshold maximizes inclusion of patients
with recurrence. Remaining patients with clinical follow—up (n :
121) had not been followed long enough to be included.

We first identified significantly perturbed genes between the
groups using the combination of established methods (Table 2, left—
hand side). Much smaller number of genes was found significantly
perturbed (n : 234) at 1% FDR than in the tumour—normal com—
parison. Among the top—10 most perturbed genes according to
PINCAGE, the distributions of observations are complex for both
groups (Supplementary Fig. 510) and classification based on individ—
ual data types appear difficult.

3.4.1 Classification of progressing versus non-progressing

We next asked how accurately the PINCAGE models could classify
unseen tumour samples as progressing (i.e. aggressive) versus non—
progressing—a question of great clinical relevance. Given the limited
number of progressing tumours, a cross validation procedure was
used. Specifically, we divided the training data into 14 subsets, with
one progressing sample and 4—5 non—progressing samples in each. In
each fold of the procedure, a subset is held out for validation and
the remaining training samples were used to (i) rank genes according
to significance evaluation and (ii) train classifiers for each gene in
top—10. This approach was used with the integrative PINCAGE
model and the combination of established methods.

Similarly to the tumour versus normal setting, the classifiers
based on a running combination of top—k genes generally performed
better than individual gene classifiers for the PINCAGE methods.
However, the performance peaked already at top—2 genes for the

Table 2. Left: Top-10 ranked genes in the BRCA progression dataset

integrative PINCAGE classifier (AUC:0.8358), which was signifi—
cantly better than that of the corresponding LR classifier
(AUC:0.7895; P—value:7.76e—09; DeLong’s test, (Delong et al.,
1988)). However, the LR classifiers trained using PINCAGE—identi—
fied genes exhibited erratic AUCs ranging from 0.4091 at the fifth
gene to 0.8860 at the ninth gene, suggesting that the LR classifica—
tion was less robust. The LR classifiers based on genes ranked by the
combination of established methods generally showed poorer per—
formance, peaking at the top ranked gene (AUC:0.7055), with con—
sistently lower AUCs for all running combinations.

3.4.2 ZNF706 and SERPINE3

The most consistently top—ranked genes (22 of 28 possible positions
in the top—2; Supplementary Table S6) in the 14—fold cross—valid—
ation procedure were the Serpin Peptidase Inhibitor Member 3
(SERPINE3) and the Zinc Finger Protein 706 (ZNF706). The candi—
dates ranked 3—10 did not validate as well and therefore hold less
promise as effective biomarker candidates—larger datasets would
be needed to reliably identify and evaluate these. Neither of the two
top biomarker candidates has previously been linked to breast can—
cer. ZNF706 is a zinc finger transcription factor with limited char—
acterization in the literature; however, it was found upregulated in
Laryngeal Squamous Cancer (Colombo et al., 2009). We also found
it consistently upregulated in tumours versus normals in the BRCA
set (P-value:2.02e—08; edgeR). In the progression dataset, its gene
body and promoter methylation levels were significantly correlated
with gene expression. Also, the gene body methylation levels were
significantly different between progressing and non—progressing
tumours when evaluated on their own (P—value:5.23e—4, Welch’s
t—test; Supplementary Fig. 510, ZNF706). Four alternative splicing
isoforms exist for ZNF706 and the differential gene body methyla—
tion could potentially signify their differential usage.

SERPINE3 belongs to the large serpin family of protease inhibi—
tors, which targets a wide variety of serine and cysteine proteases.
Though little is known specifically about SERPINE3, excreted ser—
pins were previously found to be important in producing the correct
microenvironment for tumour growth and spread (Xiao et al.,

1999). Recently, serpins were found to play a role in brain localiza—
tion of breast and lung cancer metastases (Valiente et al., 2014). We
find that SERPINE3 has significantly lower levels of gene body
methylation in progressed versus non—progressed BRCA tumour
samples (P—value :3.15e—5, Welch’s t—test), but remains very lowly
expressed in both groups (Supplementary Fig. 510, SERPINE3).
However, we find other serpins to be more highly and differentially
expressed in the progression set: SERPINB3, SERPINB4,
SERPINB7, SERPINE1 (2.06e—07, 2.216—07, 5.986-03 and 3.176-05
respective P—values; edgeR), though the functional interpretation
and possible relation to SERPINE3 is not known.

Although both ZN706 and SERPINE3 are interesting biomarker
candidates for breast cancer disease progression, further studies are
needed to establish their roles and clinical applicability. However, this
task is beyond the scope of the current work. In comparison with best
classifiers based on clinical and immunohistochemistry features for
the same BRCA dataset (Ray et al., 2014), with AUCs averaging
0.686 across different tasks including prediction of survival in dicho—
tomized timeframes, the identified biomarker candidates represent
significant improvements in classification performance.

3.4.3 Classification using PAM50 external gene set

Based on a large microarray—based gene expression dataset including
diverse BRCA subtypes, Parker et al. (2009) defined a set of 55
genes of diagnostic and prognostic value known as the PAM5 0 gene
set (Supplementary Table S7). We evaluated the classification per—
formance of all genes from this set across both PINCAGE and ML
methods. Again, we used PINCAGE Z—scores to select top genes at
each of the 14—folds.

The mean performance on this gene set using single rank classifiers
was highest for integrative PINCAGE (Table 3), followed by LR,
Bayesian LR and Random Forests. Upon combination of all PAM50
genes for which both methylation and gene expression data was avail—
able (n : 54), the performance increased for PINCAGE, and dropped
for the other methods. The classification performance using the exter—
nally defined PAM50 set is generally lower than for the top—ranked
genes in the genome—wide analysis (Table 2), with few classifiers
achieving AUCs above 0.6500. The genes most often top ranked were
BCL2 and PSMC4 (Supplementary Table S8), though not as often as

SERPINE3 and ZNF706 ranked at the top in the genome—wide ana—
lysis (Supplementary Table S6). These observations show that the
PINCAGE model achieves better overall signal extraction than the
other methods and can identify robust biomarker candidates.

4 Discussion

Cancer genomics data types are often integrated under a simplifying
assumption of independence (Hamid et al., 2009; Kristensen et al.,
2014). We have introduced PINCAGE, a flexible model for integra—
tion of multiple gene—level genomic data types based on the prob—
abilistic graphical model formalism. We applied it to three types of
data: gene expression, promoter methylation and gene body methy—
lation. PINCAGE integrates these by modelling pairwise inter—
actions between both DNA methylation types and gene expression.
This permits joint analysis and evaluation of data tuples while con—
sidering their relationships.

The genome—wide analysis of gene expression and DNA methyla—
tion across tumours and AN samples in the BRCA dataset revealed
patterns and correlations that support joint analysis of data types
with flexible, non—parametric models. Our findings also suggested
that regulation of expression by methylation is usually concerted with
other mechanisms in the healthy system, while in cancer, the impact
of methylation changes on expression is more limited (You and Jones,
2012). The strength likely depends on the genomic context, with other
factors such as copy number variation, binding by transcription fac—
tors, mutation of regulatory elements, histone modifications or nu—
cleosome positioning also affecting expression.

We implemented PINCAGE’s probability distributions with
Gaussian kernels. By doing so, we can encode the complex and often
multimodal distributions across data types, relationships, and
groups. Similarly to established methods for count—based RNA—seq
expression analysis that introduce a gamma prior to account for the
overdispersion of Poisson—distributed read counts (Anders and
Huber, 2010; Robinson and Smyth, 2008), we also model the over—
dispersion, however, using the gene—specific empirical priors instead.
This improves model fits in the analysis of cancer datasets known
for high variance. To our knowledge, no other method models the
overdispersion in the integrative context. Benefits of such integrated
data analysis are 2—fold. First, it enables detection of subtle

simultaneous deviations of all three variables that would be too
weak to become significant if analysed separately. Second, the infer—
ence becomes more robust to noisy data, especially when the data
types are interdependent, as seen in our simulation study. The rea—
son is that the model can exploit the partial redundancy among ob—
servations. This is relevant for both the group comparisons and the
classification of new samples. Fisher’s method for data integration,
on the other hand, assumes independence between tested data types
and therefore in some cases can under— or over—emphasize the signifi—
cance of findings when dependencies exist. In contrast, apart from
performing joint analysis, PINCAGE models the relationships be—
tween data types and thus can evaluate each set of observations with
respect to the expected dependency. This should help rank genes ac—
cording to their combined perturbation and aid in sample
classification.

Our empirically defined, kernel—smoothed probability distribu—
tions results in parameter rich specifications. Provided there is
enough training data, this approach will accurately capture both the
group—wise distributions of data types and the relationships among
them. When the amount of training data is limited, however, para—
metric specification of probabilistic distributions yields simplistic,
yet more reliable results. This can viewed in terms of the bias—
variance trade—off (Hastie et al., 2009): parameter—rich models will
typically have more prediction variance and less prediction bias
compared with parameter—sparse models. In this respect, our ap—
proach would benefit from a larger BRCA progression dataset with
more patients followed up as it would help address the issues with
high number of parameters. As the amount of quality data available
for training will likely increase in the future, parameter—rich models,
such as PINCAGE, will become increasingly powerful as prediction
variance is reduced. Also, upon combination of likelihoods across
many genes, the inherent variance of single gene models is greatly
reduced, as shown with the PINCAGE running combinations of
genes. In the future, more data types are also expected to be avail—
able per sample amenable to PINCAGE—style modelling. The gener—
ation of multiple data types could be prioritized by their
information contents (Ernst and Kellis, 2015).

In contrast to most integrative methods such as (Shen et al., 2009;
Vaske et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013), our approach aims at identify—
ing individual integrative biomarkers, rather than clusters of molecu—
lar features able to stratify patients by survival. It facilitates
translation of integrative analyses into clinical practice as assays for
individual biomarkers are more scalable and cheaper than the gen—
ome—wide platforms whose data is required for clustering. PINCAGE
could also be used to cluster samples into subtypes by appropriate for—
mulation of the question in probabilistic terms. For instance, a dis—
crete parent variable denoting group membership could be introduced
into the model. Our future work could also be directed at parameter—
sparser implementation of the model, which would help in the ana—
lysis of smaller cancer cohorts that offer limited training material.
Finally, PINCAGE could also be used for feature selection for external
ML classification methods, similarly to the supervised canonical cor—
relation analysis methods such as GNCCA (Wang et al., 2014).
However, the Naive Bayes classification used in PINCAGE proved to
be well performing, especially when combining evidence across genes.
On the other hand, further studies are required to confirm the robust—
ness of integrative biomarker candidates, and to test how well they
generalize across cohorts.

Integrative cancer genomics analysis has received growing attention
over the last years, but much work remains. With the advent of large
publically available datasets, such as from the TCGA or ICGC, and
with the growing data generation of individual research laboratories,

integrative methods will play increasing roles in clinical research and
practice as they better exploit the available information and become in—
creasingly robust with higher number of data points. Collection of mo—
lecular data has to be met with increased quality of clinical annotations,
which will facilitate discovery of molecular biomarkers for improved
diagnosis, prognosis and treatment stratification of patients.

The freely available PINCAGE software is available as R scripts
with examples of processed BRCA data at http://moma.ki.au.dk/prj/
pincage/, with a faster and more user—friendly implementation under
development.

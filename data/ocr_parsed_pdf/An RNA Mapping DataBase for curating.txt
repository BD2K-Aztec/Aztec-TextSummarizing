ABSTRACT

Summary: We have established an RNA mapping database (RMDB)
to enable structural, thermodynamic and kinetic comparisons across
single-nucleotide-resolution RNA structure mapping experiments. The
volume of structure mapping data has greatly increased since the
development of high-throughput sequencing techniques, accelerated
software pipelines and large-scale mutagenesis. For scientists wishing
to infer relationships between RNA sequence/structure and these
mapping data, there is a need for a database that is curated,
tagged with error estimates and interfaced with tools for sharing, visu-
alization, search and meta-analysis. Through its on-line front-end, the
RMDB allows users to explore single-nucleotide-resolution mapping
data in heat-map, bar-graph and colored secondary structure graph-
ics; to leverage these data to generate secondary structure hypoth-
eses; and to download the data in standardized and computer-friendly
files, including the RDAT and community-consensus SNRNASM for-
mats. At the time of writing, the database houses 53 entries, describ-
ing more than 2848 experiments of 1098 RNA constructs in several
solution conditions and is growing rapidly.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the secondary and tertiary structures of RNAs is
critical for dissecting their diverse biological functions, ranging
from catalysis in ribosomal RNAs to gene regulation in
metabolite-sensing riboswitches and protein-binding elements in
RNA messages (Eickbush and Eickbush, 2007; Kudla et al.,
2009; Nudler and Mironov, 2004; Spahn et al., 2001; Yanofsky,
2004). RNA structure has therefore been intensely studied with a
variety of biophysical and biochemical technologies (Adilakshmi
et al., 2006; Getz et al., 2007; Waldsich, 2008; Varani and
Tinoco, 1991; Wilkinson et al., 2006). Among these tools, a
facile, information-rich and widely used technique is structure
mapping (also called structure probing or footprinting), in
which the chemical modiﬁcation, enzymatic cleavage or degrad-

ation rate of an RNA nucleotide correlates with the exposure,
flexibility or other structural features of the site. Modern meth-
ods often reverse transcribe probed RNA molecules into DNA
fragments whose lengths can be subsequently analyzed to infer
the locations of probe events. These methods permit the
single-nucleotide resolution readout of structural data for
RNAs as large as ribosomes (Deigan et al., 2009; Culver et al.,
1999), and in recent years, investigators have developed
high-throughput technologies, such as 96-well capillary electro-
phoresis (Mitra and Shcherbakova, 2008; Mortimer and Weeks,
2007) and deep sequencing (Lucks et al., 2011) to perform this
step. Furthermore, several bioinformatic pipelines have been im-
plemented to rapidly quantify, map and analyze the resulting
data (AViran et al., 2011; Deigan et al., 2009; Low and Weeks
2010; Vasa et al., 2008; Yoon et al., 2011). RNA mapping ex-
periments are now routinely used to improve automated second-
ary structure modeling (Deigan et al., 2009), probe entire Viral
genomes (Watts and Dang, 2009), simultaneously map arbitrary
RNA mixtures through deep sequencing (Kertesz et al., 2010;
Lucks et al., 2011; Underwood et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2010)
and infer an RNA’s ‘contact map’ by coupling to exhaustive
single-nucleotide mutagenesis (Kladwang and Das, 2010;
Kladwang et al., 2011).

These developments could enable novel methods in RNA
structural biology, especially if predictive relationships between
RNA sequence/structure and these data can be established.
However, unlike existing structural biology fields like nuclear
magnetic resonance and crystallography, there is no equivalent
of the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (Ulrich et al., 2007)
or the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) that stores
curated datasets. Structure mapping data are available in the
supporting material of papers or self-reported in SNRNASM
format (Rocca-Serra et al., 2011), but these formats do not typ-
ically include error estimates; are not always normalized or
background-subtracted with standardized protocols; are not
linked to RNA structures and are not straightforward to Visual-
ize, which would enable consistency checks during further ana-
lysis. We have therefore created an RNA mapping database
(RMDB) and are populating it with curated structure mapping
measurements in human and machine-readable formats amen-
able to inferring relationships between sequence/structure and
structure mapping data. Data contained in the RMDB are
freely available and can be easily integrated with future reposi-
tories such as RNAcentral (Bateman et al., 2011).

RNA Mapping DataBase

 

2 DATABASE CONTENT AND STRUCTURE

For a speciﬁc RNA in defined solution conditions, each structure
mapping experiment can be conceptualized as M x N matrices,
where M is the number of measurements made on the RNA, e. g.
normalized peak areas calculated by HiTRACE Noon et al.,
2011), CAFA (Mitra et al., 2008) and ShapeFinder (Vasa
et al., 2008); or maximum likelihood parameters (AViran et al.,
2011) and N is the number of nucleotides in the RNA. Entries in
the RMDB house these data matrices and are enriched with an-
notations and free text to describe associated content.

The database currently includes experiments using base
methylation by dimethyl sulfate, base adduct formation by
1-cyc1ohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p—toluene
sulfonate, selective 2/ hydroxyl acylation with primer extension
(SHAPE) with either N—methylisatoic anhydride or 1-methyl-7-
nitroisatoic anhydride and hydroxyl radical footprinting. The
RMDB is further capable of storing data from enzymatic,
in-line and other structure mapping experiments. The RNAs
probed include riboswitches, tRNAs, ribozyme and ribosomal
domains featured in several published studies as well as
human-designed sequences accruing in the internet-scale RNA
engineering project EteRNA (http://eterna.stanford.edu) (see
Supplementary Table S2). For many RMDB entries, the com-
plementary DNA fragment separation and analysis steps were
carried out by 96-well format capillary electrophoresis and the
HiTRACE pipeline Noon et al., 2011), respectively; entries
describing data from (Lucks et al., 2011) were read out and pro-
cessed using the SHAPE-Seq protocol (AViran et al., 2011).

New experimental data can be uploaded to the RMDB as a
spreadsheet in the SNRNASM Isa-Tab format (Rocca—Serra
et al., 2011) or in RDAT ﬁle format (a simple text ﬁle format;
detailed in the Supplement Information and at http://rmdb.stan
ford.edu/repository/specs/). However, like the well-curated
Protein DataBank, public release then requires passing review
by the RMDB team; the data must include error estimates or
replicates, information on estimated or known structure (at
least at the level of secondary structure), associated publications
or preprints and descriptions of how the data were processed.

3 FEATURES AND EXAMPLE USE CASES

3.1 For experimentalists

The RMDB is a resource for RNA biochemists and molecular
biologists interested in using existing data to guide biological
hypotheses, interpret new data or to share their own experimen-
tal results. First, users interested in a particular RNA system can
quickly ﬁnd relevant data in the RMDB by using the full-text
search ﬁeld in the upper-right corner of the site. The user can
then inspect each entry using the data Visualization tools (Fig. 1a
and b; Supplementary Material). Second, the integration with the
VARNA applet allows for quickly comparing mapping data
against structural models. The data can be downloaded in
either RDAT or SNRNASM format or exported directly from
the VARNA Visualization applet for further inspection with
other tools. Third, the RMDB also includes a secondary struc-
ture prediction server (located at http://rmdb.stanford.edu/struc—
tureserver); the server can use structure mapping data to generate
sensible secondary structure hypotheses (see Supplementary

database. (a) Classic bar plot of 2’-OH acylation (SHAPE) rates across
the nucleotides of the adenine-sensing domain of the add riboswitch from
Vibrio vulm'ficm. The data are from a ‘standard state’ study averaging 19
replicates across multiple experiments and estimating the resulting errors
(shown as error bars); the RNA’s crystallographic secondary structure,
colored by the SHAPE data, is shown in the inset. (b) Through
mutate-and-map data, the RMDB also allows exploring the contact
map of the same riboswitch. SHAPE data are shown for constructs
with single mutations at each RNA position. (0) Histograms for reactiv-
ities found in interior loops, hairpin loops and helices. Nucleotides in the

Material). Finally, experimentalists who wish to submit their
data to the RMDB can do so after registering to the site.

3.2 For structural bioinformaticists

The RMDB can extract general properties of mapping data
including histograms of reactivities for different secondary struc-
ture elements (Fig. 1c). Analyses of structure mapping data are
facilitated by the Python/MATLAB RDATkit package (http://
rdatkit.simtk.org, see Supplementary Material) for RDAT/
SNRNASM-IsaTAB parsing. To demonstrate the utility of the
RMDB in extracting new information from multiple datasets, we
tested whether the SHAPE method can discriminate between
interior and hairpin loops. Using the advanced search feature
of the database, we downloaded SHAPE data for each secondary
structure element (internal loops, hairpins, helices and bulges)
collected in standard state experiments for all non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs) with known structure in the database.
Interior and hairpin loops of ncRNA have distinct reactivity
distributions, suggesting that SHAPE-directed modeling can be
made more accurate by taking this effect into account (Fig. 1c).

3.3 For web-app developers

Data stored in the RMDB are exposed through a RESTful API
(described in https://sites.google.com/site/rmdbwiki/web-api) in
JSON format, simplifying the creation of web applications that

use the data contained in the repository. The RMDB also
provides RSS feeds that are automatically updated with new
entries (see https://sites.google.com/site/rmdbwiki/rss for details).
These tools have allowed integration of the entries in the RMDB
into the SNRNASM repository (http://snrnasm.bio.unc.edu/
browse.html).

4 DISCUSSION

The throughput of structure mapping experiments has taken sig-
niﬁcant leaps with multiplexed capillary electrophoresis and
next-generation sequencing that allow probing of thousands of
RNAs at once. These data should, in principle, permit the devel-
opment of conﬁdent structural biology tools that couple struc-
ture mapping measurements to secondary and tertiary structure
modeling. However, until recently, researchers have had few re-
sources that enable curation and sharing of high-throughput
quantiﬁed RNA mapping data. It is our hope that the RMDB
will make such projects possible.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many studies have shown that epigenetic changes, such
as altered DNA methylation and histone modifications, are linked to
estrogen receptor or (ERa)-positive tumors and disease prognoses.
Several recent studies have applied high-throughput technologies
such as ChlP-seq and MBD-seq to interrogate the altered architec-
tures of ERa regulation in tamoxifen (T am)-resistant breast cancer
cells. However, the details of combinatorial epigenetic regulation of
ERa target genes in breast cancers with acquired Tam resistance have
not yet been fully examined.

Results: We developed a computational approach to identify and
analyze epigenetic patterns associated with Tam resistance in the
MCF7-T cell line as opposed to the Tam-sensitive MCF7 cell line,
with the goal of understanding the underlying mechanisms of epigen-
etic regulatory influence on resistance to Tam treatment in breast
cancer. In this study, we used ChlP-seq of ERa, RNA polymerase II,
three histone modifications and MBD-seq data of DNA methylation in
MCF7 and MCF7-T cells to train hidden Markov models (HMMs). We
applied the Bayesian information criterion to determine that a 20-state
HMM was best, which was reduced to a 14-state HMM with a
Bayesian information criterion score of 1.21291 x 107. We further
identified four classes of biologically meaningful states in this breast
cancer cell model system, and a set of ERa combinatorial epigenetic
regulated target genes. The correlated gene expression level and gene
ontology analyses showed that different gene ontology terms were
enriched with Tam-resistant versus sensitive breast cancer cells. Our
study illustrates the applicability of HMM-based analysis of
genome-wide high-throughput genomic data to study epigenetic influ-
ences on E2/ERa regulation in breast cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

The dysfunction of estrogen receptor a (ERa), an estrogen (E2)-
inducible transcription factor, accounts for the growth of ~70%
of breast tumors (EBCTCG, 1998). Treatment with tamoxifen
(Tam), an estrogen antagonist and a selective ER modulator, has
been successful; however, ~25% of the patients that respond to
antihormonal therapy relapse within 10 years (EBCTCG, 2005).
Many studies have shown that epigenetic changes, such as

altered DNA methylation and histone modifications, are linked
to ERa-positive tumors and prognoses of the disease (Hsu et al.,
2010; Kovalchuk et al., 2007; Kutanzi et al., 2010; Rodriguez
et al., 2011). Other recent studies, including ours (Gu et al.,
2010; Shen et al., 2011), have applied high-throughput technol-
ogies such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP—seq) and methyl binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq)
to interrogate the altered architectures of ER): regulation in
Tam-resistant cells. However, the details of combinatorial epi-
genetic regulation of ER): target genes in breast cancers with
acquired Tam resistance have not yet been fully examined. We
sought to develop a computational approach to identify and
analyze these epigenetic patterns to gain insight into the epigen-
etic changes associated with Tam resistance in the MCF7-T cell
line compared with the Tam-sensitive MCF7 cell line, and ultim-
ately to understand the underlying mechanisms of epigenetic
regulatory influence on Tam resistance in breast cancer.

The hidden Markov model (HMM), originally developed for
computerized speech recognition, is a widely used statistical
method for computational modeling and analysis of various bio-
logical questions (Fischer et al., 2005; Henderson et al., 1997; Qin
et al., 2010). The basic principle of a Markov model is that it is a
form of a Markov chain (a type of stochastic finite-state ma-
chine) in which each state has been extended with a set of outputs
and probabilities to emit each output. In an HMM, the state
sequence giving rise to the outputs is not Visible, but the
output sequence is known. Ernst et a]. used HMMs to find epi-
genetic states in several human cell types on the basis of epigen-
etic data (Ernst J. et al., 2011; Ernst and Kellis, 2010). Xu et a].
(2008) used HMMs to identify differential histone modiﬁcation
sites between two ChIP—seq samples. Given these successful ap-
plications of HMMs, we applied the HMM to study epigenetic
mechanisms underlying Tam resistance.

In this study, we used ChIP-seq of ERa, RNA polymerase
II (PolII), three histone modiﬁcation marks and MBD-seq data
of DNA methylation in both MCF7 and MCF7-T cells to train a
first-order HMM. These datasets were used because they were
the only datasets available in both MCF7 and MCF7-T at the
time this study was begun. We then applied the Bayesian infor-
mation criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) to determine a best
number of combinatorial epigenetic states. We further identiﬁed
a set of ERa-regulated combinatorial epigenetic states, including
promoter states and several levels of transcription, by their prob-
ability of emitting ERa/E2. Finally, gene ontology (GO) analysis
was performed through the web-based tool DAVID on the
genes in each list to ﬁnd functional enrichments (Huang et al.,
2009a, b) (Fig. 1).

2 METHODS

2.1 Preprocessing

Each chromosome in the entire genome (hg18) was divided into 1000-bp
bins with the exception of cth (as MCF7 and MCF7-T are
female-derived cell lines) and chrM (no histones). The 1000-bp size was
decided because the intent of this study is to identify combinatorial regu-
latory patterns, not necessarily to replicate the annotation scheme de-
veloped by Ernst et a]. Additionally, this study uses fewer datasets than
the Ernst studies, potentially increasing the effect of bias or spurious
reads in one dataset on the output sequence used for HMM training.
A total of 1000 bp was used to mitigate possible spurious reads. For each
dataset, the unique matched reads (UMRs) (Supplementary Table S1)
were assigned to a bin according to their 5’ end. We determined the
mark status for each bin for each of eight datasets as either ‘0’ for
non-mark or ‘1’ for mark if the number of reads in the bin is sufﬁcient
such that P< 10’4 under the Poisson distribution, as described by Ernst
et a]. (Ernst and Kellis, 2010). An alphabet of 256 (28) observation sym-
bols was constructed by enumerating each possible combination of marks
including no marks. This enumeration was performed by mapping each
mark to a bit in an integer value (Supplementary Table S1), and for each
possible combination of marks, calculating the logical odds ratio of the
bits of these marks. For example, observation 137 (0b10001001) corres-
ponds to the presence of DNA methylation (128:0b10000000),
H3K4me2 (8 = 0b00001000) and ERoz/E2 (1 = 0b00000001), and the ab-
sence of all other marks. Each bin was assigned an observation according
to the combination of marks in the bin as calculated according to the
aforementioned cutoff. This was done for both cell lines to produce
the HMM training sequences, for a total of 46 sequences and 6045 312
bins.

2.2 HMM training

For each number of states from 9 to 24, ﬁve first-order HMMs were
randomly initialized and learned over all observation sequences of both
cell lines. The HMMs were learned over the aforementioned alphabet of
256 symbols corresponding to each possible combination of marks. Each
HMM was trained for 300 iterations to ensure that they approach con-
vergence (Supplementary Table S2) using the Baum7Welch algorithm
(Baum et al., 1970), with a minimum of 10’6 enforced for all transition,

emission and start probabilities (see Supplementary Material, Minimum
probability enforcement). The BIC scores of each HMM were compared,
and the lowest was of the third 20-state HMM, 1.21246 x 107. This
HMM was chosen as the initial HMM (Supplementary Fig. S1). As
States 3, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 were called in <350 bins in either cell line
(Supplementary Table S3) by the Viterbi decoding algorithm (run over
the HMM training observation sequences) (Viterbi, 1967), these states
were removed from the model, and the transition probabilities of the
remaining states to them were equally divided and added to their transi-
tion probabilities to the other remaining states (Supplementary Fig. S2).
This was done to simplify the HMM and to maximize the descriptive
power of its states. The resulting 14-state HMM (BIC = 1.22497 x 107)
was trained for a further 100 iterations to produce the ﬁnal 14-state
HMM, with a BIC score of 1.21291 x 107 (Fig. 2). The log-likelihood
of this HMM after each training iteration was calculated to show that our
Baum7Welch implementation truly improves the goodness-of-ﬁt of the
HMM with each iteration, and that 100 iterations were sufficient for this
HMM to approach convergence (Supplementary Fig. S3). To show that
this state reduction procedure produced a better ﬁtting 14-state HMM
than 14-state HMM training would have alone, 45 additional 14-state
HMMs were randomly generated and trained for 300 iterations
(Supplementary Table S4), and the signiﬁcance of the BIC score of the
model with state reduction was calculated versus all 50 HMMs initially
trained with 14 states (P<0.001, Student’s t-test).

2.3 Combinatorial epigenetic patterns

After the ﬁnal 14-state HMM was learned, the Viterbi decoding algo-
rithm was used to determine the most likely states of each bin in MCF7
and MCF7-T, using the same observation sequences used for HMM
training (Supplementary Fig. S7). The distributions of the states in each
bin were then compared with several other datasets by listing the bins
occupied by a state for each state in both cell lines. Each list of bins for
each state was ﬁrst subjected to gene annotation, by calculating the dis-
tance of each bin to the nearest gene and assigning a label to the bin based
on it (see Supplementary Material, Gene annotation) (Lan et al., 2011).
Next, the percentage of bins with each state within 2kb of a transcription
start site (TSS) region was computed to detect promoter-associated states.
Similarly, the percentage of bins with each state within a gene (5’ end to 3’
end) was computed to detect transcribed-associated states. The percent-
age of bins with each state within RepeatMasker regions was calculated
to ﬁnd states corresponding to repetitive DNA (Karolchik et al., 2004;
Smit et al., 2010). Non-coding RNA regions (n = 2975) were determined
by filtering a set of th9 genes with a refSeq ID beginning with ‘NR’
(n = 2979), then using LiftOver to convert their positions to thS coord-
inates (Hinrichs et al., 2005). The average percent of GC content in bins
with each state was calculated by ﬁrst dividing the chbase ﬁle into 1000-
bp bins analogous to those used for HMM training to map genome-wide
average GC content, and averaging the GC content in each bin with each
state (Karolchik et al., 2004). Bins not covered by the chbase ﬁle were
excluded from the calculation of the average.

To correlate HMM states with actual epigenetic marks, the proper
mark combination was ﬁrst selected, as described earlier [by mapping
each mark to a bit in an integer value, see Supplementary Tables
SEPS7, column Output(s)]. These mark combinations were enforced to
exclude spurious bins, by ﬁltering for those bins that actually have the
marks that would be expected from that states’ emission probabilities and
interpretations. The bins containing the desired state were intersected
with the bins containing the desired mark with BEDTools’ intersectBed
(Quinlan and Hall, 2010). The bins were then ﬁltered according to their
region (for example, only the bins in State 8 within a 5_TSS region were
selected). The reported expression level of each gene is that of the splice
variant with the highest expression level (see Supplementary Material,
Microarray data).

2.4 Gene expression and GO analysis

The average microarray expression in bins with each state was
computed similarly to the average GC content, using the expression of
the highest-expressed splice variant of each gene (Fan et al., 2006). GO
analysis of the genes in each list in each cell line was performed
using DAVID (Huang et al., 2009a, b). The annotations from
SP_PIR_KEYWORDS, GOTERM_BP_3 (biological process) and
GOTERM_MF_3 (molecular function) were used.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Determination of combinatorial epigenetic patterns

We applied an HMM to de novo identiﬁcation of combinatorial
epigenetic patterns for ER): regulation in both MCF7 and
MCF7-T cells. In addition to the ‘omics data publicly available,
ChIP-seq of H3K27me3, H3K4me2, PolII and ERa, the latter
two performed separately in both estrogen-treated (ERa/E2 and
PolII/E2) and untreated cells (ERa/control and PolII/control),
and MBD-seq for DNA methylation (Gu et al., 2010; Shen et al.,
2011; Welboren et al., 2009), we have performed ChIP-seq on
histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) in both MCF7
and MCF7-T (see Supplementary Material, ChIP-seq for
H3K9me2). This resulted in a total of ~108 million UMRs in
MCF7 and ~111 million UMRs in MCF7-T for all eight data-
sets (Supplementary Table S1).

A 14-state HMM (BIC: 1.21291 x 107) was trained over all
chromosomes except cth in both cell lines, with each combin-
ation of epigenetic marks as outputs (Fig. 2). The optimal state
sequence was then determined for both cell lines with this HMM
(Supplementary Fig. S8). Particularly by its emission probabil-
ities (Fig. 2B), our model revealed spatial relationships between
epigenetic marks with ERa/E2 binding, and we were able to infer
speciﬁc types of functional elements associated with a given com-
binatorial epigenetic pattern, such as promoter, enhancer, tran-
scribed, heterochromatin and mapping bias/copy number
variation. The comparison between the model’s output probabil-
ities and the actual output frequencies for each output under
each state in each bin yielded R2 20.9898 in MCF7 and
R2=O.9889 in MCF7-T (Pearson correlation, Supplementary
Figs S5B and S6).

3.2 Interpretation of combinatorial epigenetic patterns

Next, we integrated other genomic information with our HMM
training results to propose potential biological interpretations of
each of the detected combinatorial epigenetic patterns (Fig. 3)
(see Supplementary Material, Additional data sources). We were
able to identify four classes of biologically meaningful states in
this breast cancer cell model system.

3.2.] Promoter states States 8 and 11 were determined to cor-
respond to promoter regions, primarily because 58.06 and
53.76%, respectively, of the bins with States 8 and 11 were
within :l:2 kb of a TSS region. This is further supported by their
high emission probabilities for PolII and H3K4me2. Additionally,
both States 8 and 11 had relatively high GC content (53.80 and
50.50%, respectively), as expected of the majority of promoters
(Saxonov et al., 2006). State 8 was classiﬁed as active promoter
because of the high average microarray expression value of genes
associated with it (9.32). State 11 was similarly classiﬁed as weak
promoter because of its lower (compared with State 8) but still
relatively high average expression value (7.99). In addition, State
11 has a probability of 0.209 to transition to State 3 (low tran-
scribed and hypomethylated), and State 8 has a probability of
0.095 to transition to State 9 (active transcribed) and a probability
of 0.114 to transition to State 1 (low transcribed and hypermethy—
lated). These promoter to transcribed transition probabilities fur-
ther support the assignment of States 8 and 11 as promoters,
especially given that these probabilities would be lowered by the
presence of genes on the — strand (where the promoter region is
encountered last when reading the + strand from the 5/ to 3/ dir-
ection). It is also possible that State 8 is at least partially inﬂuenced
by ERa, as it has a relatively high emission probability for ERu/
E2 (0.414); however, the average microarray expression values
differ little with E2 treatment, and they differ by an average of
0.311 between MCF7 and MCF7-T.

3.2.2 Transcribed states States 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 were deter-
mined to correspond to transcribed regions, primarily because
the percentages of their bins within transcribed regions were the
highest among the states with the exception of the promoter
States 8 and 11 (57.30, 52.73, 47.96, 74.79 and 67.10% for
States 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9, respectively). In addition, high proportions

of these bins were in intragenic regions (49.18, 47.35, 44.15, 68.40
and 52.91%, respectively). State 9 was classiﬁed as highly tran-
scribed because of its high average expression value (9.39) and its
high probabilities for emitting PolII/E2 and PolII/control (0.759
and 0.729, respectively). State 3 was classiﬁed as low transcribed
and hypomethylated because of its lower average expression
value (7.21), very low emission probability of DNA methylation

(0.065) and very low probabilities for emitting PolII/E2 and
PolII/control (0.003 and 0.005, respectively). State 2 was classi-
ﬁed as low transcribed and medium methylated because of its
lower average expression value (6.97), intermediate emission
probability of DNA methylation (0.422) and very low emission
probabilities of PolII with and without E2 treatment (0.004 and
0.005, respectively). State 1 was classiﬁed as low transcribed and

hypermethylated because of its lower average expression value
(7.31), very high emission probability of DNA methylation
(0.798) and very low emission probabilities of PolII/E2 and
PolII/control (0.028 and 0.022, respectively). State 4 was classi-
ﬁed as medium transcribed because of its intermediate average
expression value (8.66) and emission probabilities of PolII/E2
and PolII/control (0.205 and 0.297, respectively). The average
expression level of State 1 increased somewhat with E2 treat-
ment, and State 1 has a 0.114 probability to emit ERa/E2 and
a 0.070 probability to emit ERa/control. E2 may at least par-
tially activate some of these regions of the genome.

3.2.3 Repressed states States 5 and 14 appear to correspond
to repressed intragenic regions, owing to their mediumihigh
probabilities of being found in intragenic regions (30.48 and
35.18%, respectively) and their low average expression values
(6.36 and 6.20, respectively). State 14 has higher probabilities
for H3K27me3 (0.515) and methylation (0.638). State 5 has
lower probabilities for H3K27me3 (0.146) and methylation
(0.195). These probabilities support the assignment of States 5
and 14 as repressed. The probabilities of H3K27me3 primarily
distinguish these repressed states from the low transcribed States
1 and 2. However, State 14 has a probability of0. 1038 to emit no
mark, 0.1174 for H3K27me3 alone, 0.2070 for methylation alone
and 0.2092 for H3K27me3 and methylation together
(Supplementary Fig. S4, note the bands at State 5 and 14,
output 160). The corresponding probabilities for State 5 are
0.5975, 0.1072, 0.1431 and 0.0234. In sum, whenever State 14
emits H3K27me3 or methylation, it emits both 39.21% of the
time, versus 8.55% for State 5. Therefore, State 14 was classiﬁed
as double repressed and State 5 as merely weakly repressed. State
12 was classiﬁed as polycomb repressed because of its very low
average expression value (5.21) and its high probability for
H3K27me3 (0.819), which is commonly associated with poly-
comb repression (Zhou et al., 2011).

3.2.4 Other states State 13 was classiﬁed as low signal/
unmappable because of the high percentage of its bins in gene
desert regions (70.60%) and its very low emission probabilities for
all marks. State 7 was classiﬁed as mapping bias/copy number
variation (CNV) because of its high emission probabilities for all
marks including those not expected to co-occur (such as PolII and
H3K27me3), implying that this state corresponds to ChIP arti-
facts rather than actual mark combinations. State 10 was classi-
ﬁed as repetitive because of the high percentage of its bins in
RepeatMasker regions (29.62%), its low emission probabilities
for all marks except H3K27me3 (0.420) and the high proportion
of its bins in gene desert regions (37.27%). State 6 was classiﬁed
as heterochromatin because of the high percentage of its bins in
gene desert regions (62.05%), its low emission probability for all
marks except H3K27me3 (0.116), its very low average expression
value (4.87), its prevalence in the genome (23.44% of all bins) and
the high percentage of its bins in RepeatMasker regions (34.83%).

3.3 Identiﬁcation of ERa combinatorial epigenetic
regulated genes

Our goal is to uncover combinatorial epigenetic influence on

ER): regulated genes in MCF7 versus MCF7-T cells. A total

of 1219 650 bins (40.35% of all bins) were in a different state

between MCF7 and MCF7-T (Supplementary Fig. S12). Because
of the number of different bins, we could not directly compare
the state sequences between the cell lines. We believe that this is
due in part to noise in the original ChIP data. Thus, we selected
States 1, 7, 8, 9 and 14 for further analysis, as they have a prob-
ability >0.1 of emitting ER): with E2 treatment in at least one cell
line (we select these E2-associated states, as Tam is an E2 antag-
onist). State 1 was correlated with DNA methylation (see Section
2, Supplementary Table S5) and ﬁltered for intragenic bins (as it
was assigned as low transcribed and hypermethylated) (V Fig.
S13). A11 bins in State 7 were used for the analysis. State 8 was
correlated with DNA methylation, H3K4me2, ERa/E2, ERa/
control, PolII/E2 and PolII/control, and ﬁltered for TSS bins
(as it was assigned as active promoter). State 9 was correlated
with DNA methylation, ERa/E2, PolII/E2 and PolII/control,
and ﬁltered for intragenic bins (as it was assigned as highly
transcribed). State 14 was correlated with DNA methylation,
H3K27me3, H3K9me2, ERa/E2 and ERa/control.

These results support the assignment of State 7 as mapping
bias/CNV. A total of 132 genes were shared by both the MCF7
and MCF7-T lists. This state was distributed consistently
(Pearson R2=O.898) between the cell lines as expected (as the
reference sequence used was the same for all ChIP alignments)
(Supplementary Table S8), and the high degree of overlap
(91.0% of the MCF7 genes and 67.7% of the MCF7-T genes)
observed here is consistent with this conclusion.

A total of 2154 genes were found to have methylated intra-
genic bins in State 1 with ERa/E2 binding and no ERa/control
binding in MCF7, while 339 genes were similarly found in
MCF7-T (Fig. 4). Additionally, the average expression level
with E2 treatment of the MCF7-T genes was higher (8.0940 in
MCF7-T versus 7.2170 in MCF7, P<6 x 10‘9, Benjamini <7 x
10‘8 and two-tailed Welch’s t-test) (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995). A total of 213 of these genes were found (and included)
in both lists. The average expression level of the genes in the
MCF7 list in E2-treated MCF7-T is 7.1893 (SD 22.4311), and
the average expression level of the genes in the MCF7-T list in
E2-treated MCF7 is 7.9295 (SD:2.4545) (P<5 x 10‘7 and
Benjamini <5 x 10‘6 of signiﬁcant expression difference between
them). ERa/E2 binding without ERa/control binding is clearly
more common in MCF7 than MCF7-T, as evident with the
much higher number of genes found in MCF7, as well as the

actual emission frequencies of ERa/E2 in MCF7-T
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). MCF7-T is apparently able to main-
tain similar expression levels of these genes even without ERa/E2
binding. The genes in the MCF7-T list appear to simply be more
active than the other genes discussed here (Supplementary Fig.
S11). This may be related to the ERa/E2 binding observed in
both cell lines. Also, the MCF7 gene list was strongly enriched
for the GO term ‘regulation of cell communication’ (P<10_10
and Benjamini <10_7).

The number of genes with bins in State 8 and 9 dropped sig-
niﬁcantly in MCF7-T compared with MCF7, as was observed
with State 1. The expression levels of the genes in the State 8 lists
changed little between MCF7 and MCF7-T, or with and without
E2 treatment. The State 9 MCF7-T gene lists had higher expres-
sion levels than MCF7 (P< 0.02 and Benjamini <0.04 in all
cases). All four of the States 8 and 9 MCF7-T gene lists were
enriched with the GO term ‘purine nucleotide binding’, but the
P—Values for many GO terms were relatively high
(Supplementary Fig. S9), in some cases failing to reach statistical
significance with Benjamini correction (Supplementary Fig. S10).
This is most likely because of the relatively small size of these
gene lists, as well as the fact that they are not necessarily func-
tionally related to each other, as they were selected on the basis
of the combinatory epigenetic patterns identified by the HMM.
The relatively large size of the MCF7 gene lists also diminished
the signiﬁcance of the GO terms found in them, as well as their
lack of guaranteed functional relation.

We chose to look at genes with bins in State 14 containing
H3K27me3, DNA methylation, H3K9me2 and ER): binding
(both with and without E2). Most notably, the average expres-
sion levels of the MCF7-T genes were signiﬁcantly elevated with
and without E2 treatment (P<0.02 and Benjamini <0.04 in both
cases) (Supplementary Tables S&S7). Although few genes were
found in either cell line (and only 11 genes are shared between
them), these genes are clearly little affected by E2 treatment in
both cell lines, independent of the Tam resistance of MCF7-T
(P>0.93 in both cases, as would be expected given this). The
significance of the GO terms was low, probably because of the
small size of the gene lists (Supplementary Fig. S9 and S10).

4 DISCUSSION

Using a HMM, we have identiﬁed states reﬂecting combinatorial
epigenetic patterns for ER): regulated target genes in MCF7 and
MCF7-T. We have interpreted each of the states to determine
their biological signiﬁcance. With our results, we have deter-
mined lists of genes affected by ER): binding with E2 in both
MCF7 and MCF7-T, considering a variety of other epigenetic
effects. Although these results do not conclusively elucidate the
epigenetic mechanisms underlying Tam resistance, they nonethe-
less illustrate the applicability of HMM-based analysis of
genome-wide high-throughput genomic data to study epigenetic
inﬂuence on E2/ERa regulation in breast cancer.

Although the application of GO analysis did not yield statis-
tically signiﬁcant terms for every gene list, the results of this
study nonetheless suggest several possible future directions. For
instance, this study was confined to HMM analysis and gene
listing. Perhaps, application of gene network analysis could
reveal key genes responsible for the regulation of the genes in

the lists formulated by this study. The lists of genes may provide
a starting point for further analyses, such as microarray assays of
tumor samples focusing on these genes.

The methods used here should be applicable in cases other
than Tam resistance in MCF7-T, using other genome-wide epi-
genetic datasets than those used in this study. The HMM train-
ing and identification of combinatorial regulated genes is
extensible to more than two cell lines [O(n) in HMM training
time and space, where n = number of cell lines, but this is paral-
lelizable with a sufﬁcient number of compute cores]. For ex-
ample, this can be used to interrogate combinatorial epigenetic
regulation patterns in multiple types of cancer, or multiple pa-
tient samples with the same type of cancer.

In the HMM implementation used in this study, each possible
combination of marks is enumerated as a possible output of the
HMM. This permits more straightforward analysis of combina-
torial marks (for example, whether marks X and Y are found
together more often or not), which is critical to this study.
Ernst et al. used a multivariate HMM approach, in which the
output probabilities of each mark are considered independently
of each other (Ernst and Kellis, 2012). Although multiple marks
are allowed in each bin with this model, it does not directly model
the frequency with which marks co-occur (which would be calcu-
lated after Viterbi decoding). For example, consider a toy HMM
with two marks and one state, learned over a sequence of two
bins. If Bin 1 has Mark 1 and Bin 2 has Mark 2, the state in both
an Ernst HMM and one of our HMMs would have an emission
probability of 50% for each mark. However, if Bin 1 has both
Marks 1 and 2, and Bin 2 has no marks, the Ernst HMM would
be the same, and our HMM would have an emission probability
of 100% for both marks and 0% for each mark alone.

Future studies could greatly beneﬁt from the incorporation of
additional data in the HMM. Although many MCF7 datasets
are available, datasets were available for only the eight epigenetic
marks used in this study in both MCF7 and MCF7-T at the time
this study was begun (a dataset must be available in all cell lines
studied to be usable in the HMM). Histone acetylation data
could broaden the context of the HMM analysis by providing
histone epigenetic data separate from the methylations analyzed
in this study. For example, H3K27ac data could support the
H3K4me2 data and possibly allow the detection of enhancers
enriched in both marks (Zhou et al., 2011), as well as better
differentiation between active promoter and weak promoter
states. H3K9me3 data may permit differentiation between con-
stitutive and facultative heterochromatin. H3K36me3 data could
allow differentiation between exons and introns. ChIP-seq of
ER): and PolII with Tam and E2 treatment would allow more
direct investigation of Tam resistance.

The potential utility of further next-generation sequencing
(NGS) data is most powerfully demonstrated by the scope of
the work of Ernst et al. (Ernst and Kellis, 2010), in which the
authors were able to deﬁne 51 HMM states by using datasets of
18 acetylations, 20 methylations and 3 other marks. Though it
would undoubtedly be impractical with current technology to
perform 41 NGS experiments each in two cell lines, it is clear
that the addition of other carefully selected datasets can improve
the discriminatory power of HMM-based methods such as those
used by Ernst et al. and this study. Additionally, the usage of
additional datasets can reduce the impact of biases in individual

datasets produced by differing experimental protocols, as the
contribution of each dataset to the observation sequences used
for HMM training is reduced. This may allow the state sequences
in each cell line to be directly compared instead of comparing
state-associated genes, as well as reduction of the 1000-bp bin
size for higher resolution.

The addition of further NGS datasets may be complicated by
the increased computational and memory requirements poten-
tially necessitated by additional data. Additional datasets may
require additional states to be included in HMMs. As the com-
putational and memory costs of our implementation of the
BaumiWelch algorithm (in particular, the gamma values) grow
according to O(nb2), where n: number of bins and b = number
of states, this would become prohibitive with increasing numbers
of states. For example, the gamma values for 20 states, 1000-bp
bins and two cell lines with long double precision (16 bytes with
GCC on the x64 architecture) would require about 36 GB of
memory (3022656 x 2 x 16 x 20 x 20 bytes). With 30 states,
this increases to ~81 GB. Although not all of this must be allo-
cated at once (as forwardibackward is performed separately on
each chromosome to allow it to be parallelized), this would none-
theless require a computer with a great deal of available memory.
However, given the historical decrease of the cost of memory,
this may become less of an issue in the future.

In addition, there are many subjective parameters in this
study. For example, 1000-bp bins were used, primarily to miti-
gate ChIP-seq noise. Reducing the bin size can potentially in-
crease the resolution of the state assignments; however, it would
increase the sensitivity of state assignment to ChIP-seq noise.
The cutoff of P< 10‘4 for the number of reads in a bin required
to call that mark present was selected solely because of its suc-
cessful use in previous work (Ernst and Kellis, 2010). This cutoff
may potentially be overly strict or overly permissive in this study.
We chose to select states with at least a 0.1 probability of emit-
ting EROl/E2 for further analysis. Although we used this thresh-
old to choose states with some relation to ERot binding, it is
admittedly arbitrary. Perhaps a statistical method could be
devised to select states for gene identiﬁcation in future work.

Abstract

Motivation: The Cellular Phenotype Database (CPD) is a repository for data derived from high—
throughput systems microscopy studies. The aims of this resource are: (i) to provide easy access
to cellular phenotype and molecular localization data for the broader research community; (ii) to
facilitate integration of independent phenotypic studies by means of data aggregation techniques,
including use of an ontology and (iii) to facilitate development of analytical methods in this field.
Results: In this article we present CPD, its data structure and user interface, propose a minimal set
of information describing RNA interference experiments, and suggest a generic schema for man—
agement and aggregation of outputs from phenotypic or molecular localization experiments. The
database has a flexible structure for management of data from heterogeneous sources of systems
microscopy experimental outputs generated by a variety of protocols and technologies and can be
queried by gene, reagent, gene attribute, study keywords, phenotype or ontology terms.
Availability and implementation: CPD is developed as part of the Systems Microscopy Network of
Excellence and is accessible at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/sym.

1 Introduction

A novel ‘systems microscopy’ research strategy has emerged during
the last decade that exploits recent developments in automated
microscopy, cell microarrays, image analysis, data mining, statistics
and modelling (Lock et (11., 2010). A wide range of methodologies is
available to the scientific community for the characterization of cel—
lular processes like mitosis or cell migration. For example, RNA
interference (RNAi) screening approaches deliver diverse sets of cell
loss—of—function phenotypes, assigned manually or automatically
using various methodologies and processing pipelines.

As part of the Systems Microscopy Network of Excellence pro—
ject, we have developed the Cellular Phenotype Database (CPD) for
management of data derived from high—throughput phenotypic stud—
ies. Reference studies like Mitocheck (Neumann et al., 2003) and

©The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

CellMorph (Fuchs et (11., 2010) provided use cases and initial data—
sets for CPD development. In total, data from 10 studies have been
loaded into the database (Di et (11., 2012; Gudjonsson et (11., 2012;
Moudry et (11., 2011; Ritzerfeld et (11., 2011; Rohn et (11., 2011;
Schmitz et (11., 2010; Simpson et (11., 2012). The database has been
released to the public.

Across these studies we have observed high phenotypic hetero—
geneity both in terms of the criteria used to assign phenotypes (via
manual or automatic annotation), and the terminology used for
phenotypic annotations. Phenotypes observed can be specific to a
given study or common across several studies. In the latter case
terms used to describe phenotypes can be harmonized via a common
ontology. To achieve this, the Cellular Microscopy Phenotype
Ontology (CMPO; Jupp et (11., 2014) was used by appending CMPO

terms to the original phenotype annotation, and ontology based
browsing was implemented in the CPD user interface.

We propose a minimal set of descriptors for reporting RNAi
studies, and describe the data representation and exploration
approaches we developed that can potentially facilitate observation
of patterns emerging from a variety of data acquisition methods and
protocols. Although currently in CPD we have integrated datasets
from RNAi—based high—throughput phenotypic studies only, the
same data management methodology could be used for aggregation
of data generated in other types of systems microscopy experiments.

2 Generic data structure

All information stored in the database, and represented through the
web—interface, can be categorized into three layers:

1. Input data layer:

a. study description: general information, speciﬁc screen infor—
mation (including protocols), list of phenotypes or features
observed, and deﬁnitions that enable interpretation of sub—
mitter—speciﬁc results output (see next point; details in the
Implementation section);

b. processed submitter’s pipeline outputs, such as reagent iden—
tiﬁcation and quantitative scores;

c. genome data with coding transcript sequences and Gene
Ontology annotation; and

d. siRNA reagent data with sequences (library ﬁles).

2. Aggregated data layer derived from input data:

a. processed data objects, where each object stores data about

genes and reagents that map to a given phenotype set; and

b. ontology mappings to the original phenotype terms.

3. Web interface layer:

a. data object pages (Gene, Reagent, Replica, Study); and

b. data aggregation pages representing ‘gene—phenotype’
relationships.

Aggregated data layer could also store information about intracellu—
lar compartments, i.e. which genes and reagents are related to which
intracellular compartment or other molecular localization objects—
see also the Section 6.

The overall schema for the studies which can be loaded into
CPD is represented in Figure 1. If a given study design and outcome
comply with this schema, then the study data can be processed and
loaded into the database. Additional metadata about the study, its
protocols and scoring methods, including phenotype definitions, are
structured during the data curation stage to conform to the Study

Description File (SDF) specifications—see the ‘Implementation’ sec—
tion below. Each new study that is to be loaded into the database is
analyzed for compatibility with SDF. A new study type can be intro—
duced by producing a new SDF template that defines how outputs of
such studies can be processed when loading into the database; the
SDF templates are stored as top level objects in the database.

3 Minimum reporting requirements

We suggest that the following information is essential when sharing
phenotypic data derived from RNAi—based studies in order to make
it discoverable, reusable and interpretable:

1. Generic information about a study including title, description,
publication details (if applicable), authors contact details and
the number of screens included in the study;

2. Information speciﬁc to each screen in the study, including target or—
ganism, materials used (e.g. cell line), reagent library details (e.g.
manufacturer, reagent type, library version), names and descriptions
of the experimental and analytical protocols used, list of all pheno—
type terms used in the study, logical scoring rules for phenotype cal—
culation (unless phenotypes have been directly assigned),
descriptions of the phenotypes observed, all phenotypes scoring par—
ameters and their types, processed data ﬁle structure and description
(including data column names, positions and types), see (4);

3. The reagent library annotation, including, as the minimum,
reagent IDs and sequences;

4. The processed data ﬁle containing the screen results in the form
of a table where each row corresponds to a plate position, and
therefore to a replica with particular reagent. Additional col—
umns must contain the score(s) that has been used to assign a
phenotype to that particular position/reagent and the phenotype
term(s) if they are directly provided, otherwise phenotype deﬁn—
ition rules deﬁned in (2) are to be applied. In special cases when
images are also to be submitted, for each plate position in the
processed data ﬁle we require an additional column with the full
image path for the image(s) associated with the selected
position/reagent. This column can be split into several columns
(one per channel), if needed.

Previous efforts for reporting minimum information about an RNAi
experiment exist (http://miare.sourceforge.net/HomePage). Our sug—
gested requirements are similar to those guidelines for capturing the
basic RNAi experiment metadata; additionally, we propose here re—
quirements for capturing phenotype details.

The above information is processed by the CPD submission pipe—
line and may be updated with information from any other pheno—
typic or molecular localization study in a similar way by generating
a corresponding SDF template—see the Section 5 below.

4 User interface

The following requirements were taken into account during user
interface development:

the interface should be intuitive and easy to use;
response times should be fast;
users should be able to access all information available;

:E‘P‘Pt‘

data browsing functionality should be available to help users
who might be unsure about what search term to use; and
5. ﬁltering options should be available for large query results.

Through the CPD interface, users can search for genes of interest by
gene symbols, Ensembl identifiers, or attributes (e.g. Gene Ontology

2738

C.Kirsanova et al.

 

terms), and retrieve the loss—of—function phenotypes observed by
suppressing the expression of the selected gene(s), through RNAi re—
agents, across independent phenotypic studies.

Similarly, users can search for a phenotype of interest and re—
trieve the RNAi reagents that have caused such phenotype(s) and
the associated target genes. Search for a phenotype, or a set of
phenotypes, is supported either by the original phenotypic annota—
tions provided by the submitters, or by the corresponding CMPO
ontology term(s), which are added at the curation stage. The re—
agents that have caused such phenotype(s) are displayed, together
with the associated target gene. Information about specific reagents
can be obtained when querying by a reagent identifier. Users can
also explore datasets by browsing phenotypes, either by the original
phenotypic annotation or by CMPO terms.

Genes and phenotypes query functionalities are enriched by an
autocomplete plugin, which limits users to enter only gene symbols,
synonyms, Ensembl identifiers, phenotype(s) or CMPO term(s)
which are already present in CPD. Alternatively, users can explore
datasets by searching studies by keyword.

Datasets can be retrieved and visualized so that users can com—
pare the observed phenotypes within a given study or across inde—
pendent studies. The latter option allows them to cross—correlate
phenotypic information obtained in different studies where the same
or different RNAi libraries have been used. The results of querying
the database by gene attribute(s), phenotype(s) or CMPO term(s)
are represented by a ‘genes—to—phenotypes’ heatmap (Fig. 2), where
the numerical value and the corresponding colour in a heatmap cell
represents evidence levels of the reagent reproducibility within a
study, across different replicas. Heatmap cells are hyperlinked to the
‘replica page’ specific for the study scoring methods.

Users can also browse data by phenotype or CMPO ontology
terms. When browsing, multiple phenotypes, either from the same
or different studies, can be selected to retrieve the list of genes (re—
agents) where interference resulted in all of the selected phenotypes.
The results are again presented as a heatmap.

Each study has a dedicated page displaying the associated meta—
data and linking to direct download of the associated data available,
for each screen in the selected study.

5 Implementation

CPD is built using MongoDB, an open—source document database
engine, one of the most popular NoSQL databases (Stein, 2013).
Data objects are stored in MongoDB collections, providing good
scalability restricted only by the available storage capacity, as well
as ﬂexibility that enables extending the functionality of the system
without major refactoring of the storage layers. This ﬂexibility was
very important during the system development phase, as well as for
the potential future extensions (as discussed in the next section). The
only drawback we can note is the availability of expertise that is im—
portant from the system support point of view, and currently is
lower than for relational databases. Study data are loaded via a sub—
mission pipeline written in Perl. The data submission schema is
shown in Figure 3.

The web application is run by Mojolicious web server
Hypnotoad, and was developed using Javascript library JQuery and
Perl framework Mojolicious. Data in exported JSON format is also
accessible through the public FTP (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/
microarray/data/cellphl).

CPD does not provide facilities to manage image files or links to
images, only processed, summary information. We believe that

Fig. 2. Example of database search result page in response to a query by
gene attribute (GO term). Five genes are retrieved (e.g. DRDZ), alongside the
reagents (e.g. AMBN20054682) mapping to them and the associated pheno-
types (e.g. Binuclear cell). The ‘Study' row lists different study acronyms
where phenotypes (here represented by CMPO terms) have been observed.
For each gene-reagent-phenotype triplet, a measure of the reagents reprodu-
cibility is given. Please note that these scores are not comparable across inde-
pendent studies but only within each study

image archiving is a separate activity that requires building a separ—
ate resource.

As of time of writing the repository aggregates data from 10 in—
dependent RNAi studies. The total number of RNAi reagents from
three suppliers is 93578; among these, 75568 have known se—
quences. We mapped these reagents onto the latest genome assem—
blies using bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) for Homo sapiens and
bowtie2 (Langmead et al., 2012) for Drosophila melanogaster.

Reagent mappings are visualized in the database interface, and only
exact matches are taken into account. Every reagent that maps to mul—
tiple genes is shown with phenotype terms assigned, but in this case due
to the off—target effect (Guest et al., 2011) we cannot know which
phenotypes are associated to which genes, therefore the corresponding
genes do not have phenotypes displayed. 135 phenotype terms observed
in the 10 studies are associated with 83 CMPO ontology terms.

Information from a phenotypic study is loaded into CPD from
three separate data files:

1. Study Description File (SDF), which contains study and pheno—
type information. This ﬁle is divided into multiple sections.

The ‘study metadata’ section contains study identiﬁer, title,
species, cell line, authors, results summary, speciﬁcation of each
study screen, i.e. protocol name and description.

The ‘phenotype’ section contains phenotypes names, descrip-
tions, information on whether the phenotype assignment has
been done manually or automatically, names of phenotypes score
parameters, logical expression describing the phenotype assign-
ment rule (unless phenotypes have been directly assigned), and
the scoring method.

The ‘screen processed data’ section contains the processed data
ﬁle name, checksum, name of each data column in the ﬁle as
corresponds to its position, unit, description and data column
types that are speciﬁc for each study type. See http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/fg/sym/submit#examples for an example.

2. Reagents Library Annotation File (RLF) with sequences that are
mandatory if we process an RNAi study, and other relevant re—
agent annotations if the study is not an RNAi experiment;

3. Processed Screen Files (PSF), the study output ﬁles with columns
described in SDF. The number of these ﬁles has to be equal to
the number of study screens (primary, validation). Each screen is
described separately in the SDF.

In addition to the study metadata, i.e. study identifier, title etc. the
SDF also contains instructions for automated submission pipeline
(see Supplementary Appendix SI). These instructions help the sub—
mission processor to interpret and load the data directly from the
study output files. See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/sym/submit/ for
more detailed information on the submission formatting
requirements.

If a novel study type comes in (currently a non RNAi—based
study), a new SDF template needs to be defined, which can then be
completed directly by the data submitter.

CMPO terms and their mappings to the original phenotypic an—
notation are obtained from an external annotation process and can

be updated on regular basis.

6 Discussion

CPD aims at providing easy access to high—throughput phenotypic
data and integrates independent studies, adding significant value to
the hard—earned primary data. Data integration in this domain is
challenging for several reasons: (i) independent datasets are hetero—
geneous since they have been processed and analyzed using different
pipelines; and (ii) systems microscopy has not achieved the same
level of standardization as other ’omics’ domains, and no standards
have been formally adopted for reporting, annotating and storing
such data, making its representation more difficult.

To solve some of the issues associated with handling systems mi—
croscopy data, we have here proposed a minimal set of information
for reporting system microscopy data, currently based on data
derived from RNAi screens, but easily extendable to include other
experimental methodologies.

In addition, CPD is the first resource to introduce use of a stand—
ardized ontology, CMPO, for querying and browsing cellular
phenotypes, in an attempt to integrate phenotypic annotations from
independent studies and enhancing the understanding of the pheno—
types observed. CMPO coverage is still limited, and a larger volume
of experimental data is needed before we can start uncovering inter—
esting correlations between independent systems microscopy studies.
CMPO development continues, and efforts to increase its coverage
are underway. Additionally, the reproducibility between screens ad—
dressing the same biological process is limited due to many reasons,
including differences in assays, siRNA libraries and statistical ana—
lysis pipelines utilized (Hancock, 2014).

Another resource that provides access to RNAi data is
GenomeRNAi (Schmidt et al., 2013). Compared to this database,
CPD displays the gene—phenotype relationships in the form of
heatmaps that facilitate data exploration, implements alternative
ways to search and browse phenotypes including corresponding

ontology—based terms, provides richer pages related to reagent—to—
gene mapping information, as well as adds the possibility of brows—
ing genes by the number of reagents mapped to them.

7 Conclusion

Although CPD has been established as a repository for systems mi—
croscopy data and currently contains only data processed from RNAi
studies, its development has shown that the same software architec—
ture paradigm can be used to manage other data related to genes,
proteins, small molecules or any other molecular entities studied
within a cellular context and which can have complex, not only bin—
ary, interrelationships. For instance, data from other kinds of cell
perturbations such as drug screening could be managed within the
CPD data model. Then, instead of ‘gene—phenotype’ relations, the
database would store ‘drug—phenotype’ relations that could be
browsed and queried in the same way as implemented for phenotypic
data. Another example is localization studies where data is in the
form ‘protein—intracellular object’ (see Fig 1).

The experience we had in developing CPD has highlighted the
need for the systems microscopy community to introduce and use re—
porting standards and controlled vocabularies for data sharing and
annotation. Such standards need to be agreed, developed and
adopted by the systems microscopy community at large before data
sharing in this field can be considered mature and comparable to
other—omics data domains. Work on standards is ongoing within the
Systems Microscopy Network of Excellence, and a report will be
published before the end of 2015. We hope that the minimum re—
porting requirements, the data formats, and the ontology proposed
here can become the foundation of a much larger harmonization ef—
fort in this domain.

Abstract

Motivation: Recent technological advances revealed that an unexpected large number of proteins
interact with transcripts even if the RNA—binding domains are not annotated. We introduce
catRAPlD signature to identify ribonucleoproteins based on physico—chemical features instead of
sequence similarity searches. The algorithm, trained on human proteins and tested on model or—
ganisms, calculates the overall RNA—binding propensity followed by the prediction of RNA—binding
regions. catRAP/D signature outperforms other algorithms in the identification of RNA—binding pro—
teins and detection of non—classical RNA—binding regions. Results are visualized on a webpage and
can be downloaded or forwarded to catRAPlD omics for predictions of RNA targets.

1 Introduction

RNA—binding proteins (RBPs) use RNA—binding domains (RDs) to rec—
ognize target RNAs and to regulate co—/post—transcriptional processes.
Examples of classical RDs include RNA—recognition motif (RRM),
double—stranded RNA—binding domain (dsRRM), K—homology (KH),
RGG box and the Pumilio/FBF (PUM) domain (Lunde et (11., 2007). In
addition to classical RDs, recent experimental studies on HeLa
(Castello et (11., 2012), HEK298 (Baltz et (11., 2012) and mESC (Kwon
et (11., 2013) cells, indicate that a number of RNA—interacting proteins
contain non—classical RDs (ncRDs) for which annotation is not yet
available. Discovery of new RDs is a challenging task: domain—
detection tools, such as HMMER (Finn et (11., 2011) and BLAST
(Camacho et (11., 2009) rely on sequence similarity searches to identify
annotated RDs and fail to recognize newly discovered RBPs. Similarly,
other methods such as RNApred (Kumar et (11., 2011) predict RNA—
binding ability using features of annotated RDs that might be different

in ncRDs. Alternatives to identify RNA—binding regions include
BindN+ (Wang et (11., 2010), PPRInt (Kumar et (11., 2008) and
RNAbindR+ (Walia et (11., 2014), but the algorithms have been trained
to identify single amino acids and not contiguous regions. catRAPID
signature overcomes these limitations by (i) predicting the propensity
of a protein to interact with RNA and (ii) identifying RNA—binding re—
gions through physico—chemical properties instead of sequence pat—
terns. The algorithm is an extension of the catRAPID approach
(Bellucci et (11., 2011) to predict protein—RNA interactions and the
cleverSuite algorithm (Klus et (11., 2014) to classify protein groups using
physico—chemical features.

2 Algorithm and performances

To build catRAPID signature we exploited a number of physico—chem—
ical properties reported in our previous publication (Klus et (11., 2014):

' We used each physico—chemical property [e.g. structural disorder
(Castello et al., 2012)] to build a signature, or proﬁle, containing
position—speciﬁc information arranged in a sequential order from
the N— to the C—terminus;

' We computed Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between signatures
of annotated human RDs and same—length regions taken from
RNA—binding proteins as well as negative controls (Supplementary
Table S1 and online Documentation);

' We identiﬁed a number of discriminating physico—chemical proper—
ties, their associated RDs and correlation cutoffs (Supplementary
Table S2 and online Documentation).

For each protein, we calculated the fraction of residues with
correlation coefficients above the cutoffs that are associated
with physico—chemical properties and RDs (Table S2; online
Documentation), which we then used to train catRAPID signature.
Using a Support Vector Machine with RBF—kernel (online
Documentation), we built a method for the (i) identification of ribo—
nucleoproteins and (ii) prediction of RNA—binding regions:

i. catRAPID signature shows an AUC : 0.76 for discrimination of
950 RBPs from 950 negative cases (10—fold cross—validation;
Supplementary Fig. S1, Table S1). On an independent test set
(Table S3) comprising 47 mouse proteins harboring ncRDs and
same number of negatives (Kwon et al., 2013), we obtained ac—
curacy : 0.71, sensitivity : 0.70, speciﬁcity : 0.72 and preci—
sion: 0.70. By contrast, conventional pattern recognition
methods such as HMMER and BLAST show poor sensitivity
(Table S3). Our algorithm outperforms RNApred in both speciﬁ—
city and precision (0.25 and 0.52, respectively; Table S3).
Moreover, catRAPID signature reliably detects ribonucleopro—
teins across different kingdoms, including M. pulmonis, E. coli,
C. albicans, S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana and A. oryza
(Supplementary Fig. S2; online Documentation).

ii. The training for the identiﬁcation of RNA—binding regions has been
done on 1115 annotated RNA—binding regions. As negative counter—
part we randomly selected 1115 non—binding regions of the same
length from each RBP (AUC: 0.80 in 10—fold cross—validation;
Supplementary Fig. S1). On 102 ncRDs versus 102 negative mouse

 

proteins, catRAPID signature outperforms other algorithms: accur—
acy : 0.67, sensitivity : 0.76, speciﬁcity : 0.60 and precision: 0.65
(Supplementary Table S4). By contrast, RNABindR + shows
accuracy : 0.48, sensitivity : 0.53, speciﬁcity : 0.42 and
precision : 0.48. Similar performances were obtained for
BindN + and PPRInt (Supplementary Table S4). In addition, we
observed high performances on a protein dataset whose RNA—bind—
ing sites have been determined through X—ray and NMR
(Supplementary Fig. S3 and online Documentation).

3 Server description and example

The input of the server is a FASTA sequence. To illustrate the output
with an example, we studied the RNA—binding ability of Fragile X
Mental Retardation Protein FMRP. catRAPID signature predicts
that FMRP binds to RNA (overall interaction score : 0.85; Fig. 1A;
Fig. S4) and correctly identifies two peaks corresponding to the KH
domains and one peak in the RGG box (Ascano et al., 2012)
[Fig. 1A,B and C; ‘classical’ score:0.73]. In addition, catRAPID
signature indicates that the N—terminus (amino acids 1—215; Fig. 1B)
has RNA—binding ability (‘putative’ score : 0.74), which is in agree—
ment with very recent evidence revealing the presence of a novel KH
domain (Myrick et al., 2015). Comparing experimental targets
[number of PAR—CLIP binding sites 2 1] (Ascano et al., 2012) with
transcriptome—wide predictions of FMRP N—terminus [amino acids
1—215; Fig. 1D] (Agostini et al., 2013) we observed a significant
enrichment in predicted interaction propensities (P—value < 1 ’9
calculated with Kolmogorov—Smirnov test on 105 X 103 transcripts
of which 7>< 103 positives), which suggests that the N—terminus
contributes to the RNA—binding ability of the full—length FMRP.

4 Conclusions

As newly discovered RDs are not annotated, traditional domain—
detection tools fail their identification. catRAPID signature addresses
this limitation by detecting binding regions through physico—chemical
features. Our algorithm will be helpful to investigate components of
ribonucleoprotein complexes and to identify RNA—binding regions.

(Ascano et al., 2012) and a recently discovered RD at the N-terminus (Myrick et al., 2015). (C) Annotated RDs are shown in a table and linked to PFAM webpages; (D)

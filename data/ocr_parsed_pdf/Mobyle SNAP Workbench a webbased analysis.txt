Mober SNAP Workbench

 

next generation sequencing (NGS) reads or metagenomic data because
these ﬁles are typically multiple gigabytes in size and require several con-
secutive pre-processing steps. In this case, each workﬂow can be scripted
into a single XML, eliminating the transfer of intermediate metadata over
the network. A formal description of the XML grammar (https://projets.
pasteur.fr/projects/mobyle/wiki) is available on the Mobyle project web-
site. Although there is currently no mechanism in mobyle for browsing
ﬁles on the server, the path to ﬁles can be speciﬁed in the XML. We
provide a tool for uploading large data ﬁles using the Velocity service
(https://velocity.ncsu.edu/) hosted at NC State University. Users that set
up a local instance of the portal can also upload NGS data ﬁles via sftp
using clients such as Cyberduck for Mac (http://cyberduck.ch/) and
WinSCP for Windows (http://winscp.net/eng/index.php). The workﬂows
track all metadata from original source data to ﬁnal results, thereby
ensuring that data recording and analysis are explicitly traceable.

3 FRAMEWORK

Several integrative computational analysis frameworks have
been developed that bring together tools, parameter settings
and metadata for streamlining computational analyses and
making results transparent and reproducible (Nekrutenko and
Taylor, 2012). Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010) and Mobyle
(Neron et al., 2009) are two open, widely used web—based
platforms being actively developed to bring together diverse
computational tools and to provide a framework for adding
new tools and workflows. We developed new program XMLs
and workﬂows that can be deployed on the Mobyle web—based
framework (Supplementary Tables 1S and 2S). These include
XMLs and workﬂows for (i) large—scale phylogenetic and meta—
genomics analyses, (ii) computationally intensive simulations in
population genetics and (iii) routine summary statistics for data
exploration and a priori inferences on biological processes. The
Mobyle SNAP Workbench web—portal allows researchers to
seamlessly manage and execute complex command—line
programs with multiple input files and parameters on a high—
performance Linux cluster; these tools are parameter—rich or
memory—intensive, often requiring several days or weeks to
run. Our optimization includes selecting appropriate number of
compute nodes and machine architecture for MP1 programs and
when possible, parallelization of computational tasks to execute
on multiple machines. A unique feature of the portal is the
implementation of workﬂows that link together several programs
sequentially. This greatly facilitates exploratory population gen—
etic and genomic analyses for the novice user but also allows for
efﬁcient use of cluster resources. The current version of our
portal utilizes version 1.0.7 of Mobyle and is deployed in the
NC State University Virtual Computing Lab (VCL). Users can
also download program XMLs (http://carbonelab.org/system/
ﬁles/snap_xmls.tgz) and the most recent version of Mobyle to
install a local instance of the portal (https://projets.pasteur.fr/
projects/mobyle/wiki/download). Programs and associated
workﬂows are organized into fourteen subject areas
(Supplementary Table S1). The XMLs are distributed to work
on batch submission systems that are supported by Mobyle
(https://projets.pasteur.fr/projects/mobyle/wiki). In addition to
providing curated sample datasets and parameter values in
XMLs, the Mobyle SNAP Workbench framework extends
Mobyle’s interactive tutorial pages with embedded YouTube
videos. Tutorials are designed to guide the user through several

sample analyses illustrating the portal data—entry—interface design
and user—interactive web applets.

3.1 Implementation

The Mobyle SNAP Workbench portal is publicly available
at http://snap.hpc.ncsu.edu/. We also distribute the program
descriptions in XML format, which can be used in combination
with Mobyle to host a web server. The web server can be hosted
on a single unix/linux—based machine capable of hosting a web
server, but many programs are optimized to take advantage of
Message Passing Interface (MP1) and multiple processing
resources available in a computing cluster for increased
computational power. Mobyle SNAP Workbench has been
useful for teaching by providing students with a convenient
way to learn to use bioinformatics tools without requiring any
familiarity with unix and program—specific command—line param—
eters. The implementation of the portal on a linux cluster has
greatly facilitated phylogenetic/metagenomic analyses and
genome assemblies as part of an ongoing interdisciplinary
study of fungal endophytes and their function in boreal forests
(http://www.endobiodiversity.org/). We anticipate that the portal
will facilitate genome—scale coalescent—based inferences
from large resequencing projects (Wei et al., 2013) and
enhance exploratory comparative analyses spanning the popula—
tion/species interface and higher taxonomic scales.

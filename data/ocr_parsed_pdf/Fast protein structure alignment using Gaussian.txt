Fast protein structure alignment

 

structural units (Gibrat et al., 1996; Kawabata and Nishikawa,
2000; Kolbeck et al., 2006; Krissinel and Henrick, 2004;
Lu, 2000; Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998; Szustakowski and
Weng, 2000; Zhang et al., 2010). For example, Sheba finds an
initial superposition using a DP scoring matrix that combines
sequence homology, secondary structure similarity, solvent ac—
cessibility and polarity to obtain an initial superposition which is
then optimized using DP to maximize the number of close CorCa
distances. The method of Jung and Lee (2000), ProSup (Lackner
et al., 2000) and TM—Align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) identify
short seed fragments to give initial superpositions which are then
optimized in similar ways. Yet other approaches deﬁne and
match higher—order structural alphabets (Konagurthu et al.,
2008; Lo et al., 2007; Razmara et al., 2012; Stivala et al., 2009;
Tyagi et al., 2007; Yang and Tung, 2006) or fragments that might
subsequently be re—assembled (Budowski—Tal et al., 2010; Pandit
and Skolnick, 2008). Most algorithms treat proteins as
rigid—body objects, but a few can take into account structural
ﬂexibility (Salem et al., 2010; Ye and Godzik, 2003), permuta—
tions of structural motifs (Chen et al., 2006; Ilyin et al., 2004;
Sabarinathan et al., 2010; Sippl and Wiederstein, 2012;
Szustakowski and Weng, 2000) and even composite alignments
involving multiple chains (Sippl and Wiederstein, 2012).
However, almost all of these approaches are prohibitively expen—
sive if the aim is to search large protein structure databases.

As well as the diverse geometric and symbolic representations
listed above, algorithms based on sophisticated algebraic
approaches have also been described, including Lagrangian con—
tact map optimization (Andonov et al., 2008), eigenvector ana—
lysis (Shibberu and Holder, 2011) and Fourier correlation
techniques (Mavridis et al., 2012). Recent improvements to the
contact map optimization approach using integer linear pro—
gramming (Andonov et al., 2011; Wohlers et al., 2010) can
now ﬁnd provably optimal structural alignments in favourable
cases. However, as before, such techniques are currently too ex—
pensive to search large structural databases.

Here, our aim is to meet the need for a general purpose struc—
tural alignment algorithm that is sufﬁciently fast to support ad
hoc queries against large structural databases while also being
sufflciently sensitive to provide high quality (but not necessarily
optimal) pair—wise alignments. Our overall approach is motivated
by the basic observation that the four covalent bonds of each Ca
atom have a highly predictable tetrahedral geometry, which
could be used to superpose arbitrary pairs of Ca atoms and
their covalent partner atoms using least—squares fltting. Thus,
armed with the corresponding 3D fitting matrix, the relative pos—
itions of neighbouring up—stream and down—stream residues
could easily be compared and scored.

However, rather than using explicit least—squares fltting, which
is a computationally expensive operation and which requires the
coordinates of two sets of atoms, we note that a similar (but not
strictly identical) transformation can be achieved by individually
translating each Ca atom to the coordinate origin and by aligning
two of its covalent bonds with the coordinate axes. In other
words, applying such a transformation will allow the backbone
peptide fragment associated with each Ca position to be placed in
a standard, or canonical, orientation. In the context of database
search, this is clearly advantageous because it allows each struc—
ture to be pre—processed separately in linear time.

From this starting point, we calculate a similarity score for
putative pairs of backbone fragments using a sum of products
of Gaussian functions centred on the Ca positions within each
fragment and on a small number of further ‘virtual’ atom pos—
itions that encode the apparent centre of mass (COM) of each
protein, as described below. We then use these Gaussian overlap
scores to construct a DP scoring matrix with SSE—dependent gap
penalties which allows an optimal set (according to our scoring
function) of equivalent residues to be found and superposed ef—
flciently. A particular feature of a scoring function based on
sums of Gaussians is that it implicitly favours close contacts
without necessarily needing to exclude long—range pairs.
Although we implemented SSE—dependent gap penalties initially
to improve database retrieval performance, we find that using
such penalties together with our Gaussian scoring function tends
to produce alignments with smaller numbers of aligned residues
but with somewhat tighter 3D overlays of SSEs than the other
alignment algorithms studied here.

It should be noted that Taylor and Orengo (1989) ﬁrst demon—
strated the utility of using local coordinate systems. They con—
structed a local coordinate frame for each residue using N—C and
Cﬂ—H bond vectors, but crucially they used it only to compare
patterns of intra—molecular vectors rather than inter—molecular
distances. Although later approaches that use internal torsion
angles such as Yakusa (Charpentier et al., 2005) and SABIC
(Shen et al., 2010) share a similar insight to our approach, the
inter—molecular scoring functions in these algorithms can only
compare one angle or one distance for each pair of residues. In
contrast, for each position along a backbone, our Gaussian scor—
ing function can be used to score the similarity of two local
backbone fragments by comparing the positions of up to three
residues in each direction along the chain. Hence, we also use
Gaussian overlap scores to deﬁne the secondary structure of
each residue according to its similarity to a model a—helix or
ﬂ—sheet. On a contemporary workstation, our multi—threaded al—
gorithm can calculate thousands of structural alignments per
second. Hence we named it ‘Kpax’ (being short for ‘thousands
of protein alignments by canonical Ca coordinate centres per
second’).

2 METHODS
The Kpax similarity score for a pair of residues 1' and j has the form:
Kij = levlfcal + wsKgpatial + waglosum, 

where each K is a normalized score with a value between zero and one,
and each w is a weight factor in the same range and normalized such that
M + wS + wb = 1.0. The ﬁrst term gives a measure of the local similarity
of a pair of residues when calculated in a common coordinate frame. The
second term measures their spatial similarity with respect to the relative
position of the COM of a protein (also calculated in the same frame).
These two terms are described in more detail below. The ﬁnal term is the
Blosum62 amino acid similarity score, in which each pair-wise score has
been scaled onto the above range. Here, we set wb = 0 in order to consider
only structure-based alignments.

2.1 Constructing local Ca coordinate frames

Here, we set up a local 3D coordinate system for each amino acid residue
by using the coordinates of its Ca, C and N backbone atoms to construct

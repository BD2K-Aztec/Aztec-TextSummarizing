ABSTRACT

Motivation: Selenoproteins are a group of proteins that contain
selenocysteine (Sec), a rare amino acid inserted co-translationally
into the protein chain. The Sec codon is UGA, which is normally a
stop codon. In selenoproteins, UGA is recoded to Sec in presence
of specific features on selenoprotein gene transcripts. Due to
the dual role of the UGA codon, selenoprotein prediction and
annotation are difficult tasks, and even known selenoproteins are
often misannotated in genome databases.

Results: We present an homology-based in silico method to scan
genomes for members of the known eukaryotic selenoprotein
families: selenoprofiles. The core of the method is a set of manually
curated highly reliable multiple sequence alignments of selenoprotein
families, which are used as queries to scan genomic sequences.
Results of the scan are processed through a number of steps, to
produce highly accurate predictions of selenoprotein genes with
little or no human intervention. Selenoprofiles is a valuable tool for
bioinformatic characterization of eukaryotic selenoproteomes, and
can complement genome annotation pipelines.

Availability and Implementation: Selenoprofiles is a python-
built pipeline that internally runs psitblastn, exonerate, genewise,
SECISearch and a number of custom-made scripts and programs.
The program is available at http://big.crg.cat/services/selenoprofiles.

1 INTRODUCTION

Selenoproteins are a rare class of proteins containing selenocysteine
(Sec), an unusual amino acid which is a cysteine analog with
selenium replacing sulfur. Speciﬁc machinery is needed for the
recoding of the UGA codon (usually a stop codon) to Sec
(Allmang et (11., 2009; Hatﬁeld et (11., 2006; Xu et (11., 2007).
The main signal for UGA recoding is a RNA secondary structure
element called SECIS (from SElenoCysteine Insertion Sequence)
present in the 3’ UTR of eukaryotic selenoprotein gene transcripts

(Copeland et (11., 2001; Grundner—Culemann et (11., 1999). Seleno-
protein homologs (not containing Sec) have been found both
as orthologs and paralogs. In most of them, a cysteine residue
is aligned to Sec. There are currently 21 known families of
selenoproteins in higher eukaryotes: Glutathione Peroxidases (GPX),
Iodothyronine Deiodinase (DI), Selenoprotein 15 (Se115 or 15kDa),
Fish selenoprotein 15 (Fep15), SelM, SelH, SelI, SelJ, SelK, SelL,
SelN, SelO, SelP, SelR, SelS, SelT, SelU, SelV, SelW, Thioredoxin
Reductases (TR), SelenoPhosphate Synthetase (SPS). Some of these
families may contain more than one member in a given genome
(e.g. Homo sapiens contains 25 selenoproteins belonging to 17
families). All known selenoproteins contain just one Sec, with a few
exceptions: SelP, SelN, some DI isoforms (Gromer et (11., 2005),
SelL (Shchedrina et (11., 2007). In protists, selenoproteomes are
variable, and recently some selenoprotein families limited to protist-
speciﬁc lineages were identiﬁed (Cassago et (11., 2006; Lobanov
et (11., 2006a, b; Novoselov et (11., 2007; Obata and Shiraiwa, 2005).
Some lineage-speciﬁc selenoprotein families have been identiﬁed
in algae as well (Lobanov et (11., 2009; Novoselov et (11., 2002;
Palenik et (11., 2007). Selenoproteins’ ﬁmction is wide ranging, and
still unknown for many families (Gromer et (11., 2005; Lobanov et (11.,
2009).

During the last decade, several computational methods have been
developed and used to identify novel selenoproteins (see Driscoll
and Chavatte 2004 for a review; Jiang et (11., 2010; Li et (11., 2009;
Zhang and Gladyshev, 2005). Most of these methods rely on the
prediction of SECIS elements. A limitation of methods based on
predicted SECISes is that they cannot identify selenoproteins with
non-canonical SECIS elements, and they can be applied only to the
species or taxonomic groups for which they were developed, since
bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic SECISes differ in their structure
and also in their localization within the transcript (Krol, 2002).
Also, SECIS prediction is problematic: while there is conservation
of the secondary structure, the sequence is poorly conserved.
Thus, genomic search for potential SECISes often lead to a large
number of false positives (as well as, occasionally, some false
negatives). Other strategies, not based on SECIS prediction, scan
the target nucleotide sequence searching for ORFs with a conserved
in frame UGA (Castellano et (11., 2004; Jiang et (11., 2010). These
strategies also produces a large number of selenoprotein candidates
in eukaryotic genomes. Like those based in SECIS searches, they
require substantial manual curation. As a result, selenoprotein
prediction is usually ignored in the standard genome annotation
pipelines and selenoprotein genes are generally mispredicted, either
by truncation of 3’ end of the gene (the UGA codon assumed to be

the stop codon of the coding region), or by truncation of the 5’ end
(the coding region assumed to start at the ﬁrst AUG downstream
of the UGA Sec codon), or by exclusion of the exon or the region
containing the UGA/ Sec codon. As the number of genome sequences
available grows exponentially, automatic tools that produce high-
quality genome annotations with minimal human intervention are
essential. Here, we present a computational pipeline, which we
name selenoproﬁles, capable of producing reliable gene predictions
for known eukaryotic selenoprotein families. Selenoproﬁles can be
used in conjunction with automatic gene annotation methods to
predict otherwise misannotated selenoprotein genes in eukaryotic
genomes. Importantly, selenoproﬁles does not rely on the prediction
of SECIS elements. Also, selenoproﬁles does not rely on individual
selenoprotein sequences to be used as initial queries, but on
sequence proﬁles characteristic of each eukaryotic selenoprotein
family. For each eukaryotic selenoprotein family, we have thus built
an high-quality, manually curated multiple amino acid sequence
alignment including all known orthologous and paralogous members
of the family, and we derived a position-speciﬁc scoring matrix
(PSSM) from it. Proﬁles derived from multiple sequence alignments
implemented as PSSM, Markov models or other structures, capture
more precisely the intrinsic variation within a protein family, and
often lead to searches that are both more sensitive (thus allowing
for the identiﬁcation of distant relatives) and more speciﬁc (easing
the identiﬁcation of spurious hits) (Altschul et (11., 1997). We show
that selenoproﬁles can be used with little or no human intervention
to accurately identify known selenoproteins in eukaryotic genomes.
Application of selenoproﬁles to the publicly available reference
annotation of metazoan genomes reveals hundreds of misannotated
selenoprotein genes.

2 METHODS
2.1 Algorithm: the selenoproﬁles pipeline

Selenoproﬁles is a computational pipeline that, provided an alignment for a
protein family, identiﬁes all members of said family encoded in a target
genome sequence. Selenoproﬁles includes curated amino acid sequence
alignments of all known eukaryotic selenoprotein families and selenoprotein
factors. However, it can actually be used with alignments from any protein
family. Technically, therefore, the pipeline is a general homology-based gene
ﬁnder program with speciﬁc features that make it particularly suitable for
selenoprotein identiﬁcation. In selenoproﬁles. the program psitblastn is used
to identify matches in the target genome to the selenoprotein sequence
alignments (Fig. 1a). These matches are then used, through two different
splice alignment programs, exonerate (Slater and Birney, 2005, and Fig. 1b)
and genewise (Birney at (11., 2004, and Fig. 1c and d) to deduce the exonic
structure of the candidate selenoprotein genes. The predictions of these two
programs are analyzed to produce a ﬁnal one (Fig. 1e). Finally, the program
SECISearch (Kryukov at (11., 1999) is used to identify suitable SECIS
elements downstream of the coding region of the candidate selenoprotein
genes (Fig. 1f). Through the entire pipeline, a number of steps are performed
(detailed below) to ﬁlter out likely false positives and to keep the number
of potential candidates under manageable levels. Next, we detail ﬁrst the
building of the selenoprotein proﬁles and then the different steps in the
pipeline.

2.2 Multiple sequence alignments of protein families

Selenoproﬁles includes amino acid sequence proﬁles for all known
eukaryotic selenoproteins, as well as for all known selenoprotein-speciﬁc
factors, that is, proteins involved in the synthesis of selenoproteins:

SECISearch

Fig. 1. Schema of the selenoproﬁles pipeline. Initially, a psitblastn search is
run using a PSSM built from the proﬁle alignment (3). The resulting genomic
intervals are merged into ‘superexon’ intervals, and cyclic exonerate is run on
each of them (h). Then, genewise is run both to reﬁne exonerate predictions
(c) and when exonerate failed recovering blast alignments (digenewise ‘to
be sure” routine). The exonerate or the genewise prediction is chosen (e), and
then results are ﬁltered, labeled and then reﬁltered with family-speciﬁc ﬁlters.
Lastly, SECISearch is used to detect potential SECIS elements downstream
of the genes (f).

SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP2), selenocysteine-speciﬁc elongation
factor (eEFsec), 0-phosphoseryl-tRNA‘“ kinase (PSTK), 0-phosphoseryl-
tRNA‘W: selenocysteine synthase (SepSecS or just SecS), selenocysteine
tRNA associated protein 43 (secp43) and SPSs (SPS 1/SPS2). Searching for
selenoprotein factors, in addition to the search for selenoproteins, is important
because some of these factors appear to be good markers of selenoprotein
encoding (Chapple and Guigo, 2008). While all selenoprotein factors (apart
SPS2) are not selenoproteins themselves, and therefore their annotation does
not suffer from the intrinsic limitations of selenoproteins, still the usage of
selenoproﬁles may result in a more accurate annotation than that produced
by standard automatic annotation methods.

The seed sequences (one per family) to build the selenoprotein proﬁles
were taken from SelenoDB (Castellano at (11., 2008), a database of
selenoproteins and selenoprotein factors. The human protein sequence was
used when available. One exception was the SelK family, for which two
distinct proﬁles were built, one utilizing the human sequence as seed and
another utilizing the Drosophila sequence. This was necessary because this
protein family is very divergent in insects. Also, the two selenoprotein
families, SelV and SelW, were merged into a single proﬁle alignment,
since they share high sequence similarity (even though SelV possesses
an additional N-terminal domain). Representative sequences from families
not yet included in SelenoDB: SelJ, SelL, Fep15, were taken from the
genomes where they were identiﬁed (see, respectively, Castellano at (11.,
2005; Novoselov at (11., 2006; Shchedrina at (11., 2007). For all families, the
sequences used to build the proﬁle were selected running the seed protein
with either psiblast or blastp (Altschul at (11., 1997) against nr (Sayers at (11.,
2010), with a very loose e-Value ﬁltering (max e-Value = 1). The resulting
sequences were aligned with the seed with t_coffee ver. 5.65 (Notredame
at (11., 2000). The alignment was then trimmed for redundancy with the

t_coffee trim subroutine. Each alignment was then manually inspected and
modiﬁed to remove spurious sequences or to add sequences that were missed
during this process.

2.3 Finding matches to the selenoprotein proﬁles in the
target genomes

In selenoproﬁles. the multiple sequence alignments in input are compared
with the sequence of the target genome using psitblastn, a member of the
psiblast family of programs. This program is an extension of tblastn, that
uses a protein PSSM to search nucleotide sequences translated in all six
frames. While the psiblast programs are generally used to search iteratively
a database and build an increasingly accurate proﬁle, in this pipeline the
proﬁle is given as input, so a single search is performed against the target
genome. Selenoproﬁles utilizes psitblastn from the ncbi blastall package,
version 2.2.22. The results of the search are ﬁltered using the program
alignthingiepl (C.E.Chapple, personal communication). Three types of blast
hits pass the ﬁlter: those in which the Sec position is aligned to a UGA codon,
those hits in which it is aligned to a cysteine-coding codon, and all other hits
whose e-Value is below a certain threshold.

2.4 Inferring the exonic structure of the selenoprotein
candidate genes

For each selenoprotein alignment, the output of the step above is a set of hits
in the genomic sequence (genomic intervals), roughly corresponding to the
exons of candidate selenoprotein genes (Fig. 1a). Each such genomic interval
is used to initiate an iterative exonerate alignment that would ideally recover
the entire exonic structure of the candidate selenoprotein gene. This initial
structure may be subsequently reﬁned through the usage of genewise, another
splice alignment tool. Before running exonerate, the genomic intervals likely
to correspond to exons of the same gene are merged in ‘superexon’ genomic
intervals, to minimize subsequent computation (Fig. 1b). For two hits to be
merged, one must align a region of the proﬁle that is downstream of the
region aligned in the other one, and also be located downstream along the
genome sequence within a given distance.

2.4.1 Cyclic_exonerate Exonerate is a generic tool for pairwise sequence
comparison. Selenoproﬁles utilizes exonerate version 2.2.0, in protein-
to-genome mode, that aligns a single protein sequence (the query) to a
nucleotide sequence (the target or subject), incorporating prediction of splice
sites. Selenoproﬁles runs exonerate in a peculiar way, hereafter described
as the cyclic_exonerate routine (Fig. 2). We use this procedure to ensure
that the whole gene structure of a candidate is found, without the need to
use as subject the whole target chromosome and neither making a priori
assumptions on the gene width. This method initially runs exonerate using
as target the genomic interval deﬁned in a blast hit (or in a ‘superexon’).
It then runs exonerate again on the same interval extended at both ends,
and compares the two alignments produced. In case that the second run
of exonerate extends the coding sequence with respect to the ﬁrst, then
additional runs will be performed, as long as extending the genomic interval
results in an extended gene structure prediction. If the extension parameter
is chosen larger than the largest expected intron, the whole gene structure of
the target should be detected.

Exonerate can only take as protein query a single sequenceiand not an
entire alignment or a proﬁle. At each run of exonerate, cyclic_exonerate
thus maps the current queryitarget alignment into the proﬁle alignment,
and selects as a query the sequence in the proﬁle which is the most
similar to the predicted protein sequence. In selenoproﬁles. only a
subset of the sequences of the proﬁle are allowed to be chosen as
exonerate/genewise queries, since the proﬁle may contain also incomplete
sequences. Cyclic_exonerate launches exonerate with a custom scoring
matrix (derived from BLOSUM62), which is favoring the extension of the
alignment over Sec-encoding UGA codons: in the query protein selected from
the proﬁle, the position(s) aligned to Sec are replaced with a ﬂag character

Fig. 2. Schema illustrating the cyclic exonerate routine. The program is run
on a genomic interval initially deﬁned by a blast hit (or a set of merged blast
hitsi‘superexon’), which is extended at each cycle. After each exonerate run
(except the ﬁrst one), the resulting prediction is compared with the previous
one and the program decides whether to perform another run or not. Just
before running exonerate (not displayed), the current alignment is mapped
to the proﬁle alignment and the query protein which is most similar to the
target sequence is chosen. Although in the shown example, exonerate is run
four times, cyclic exonerate runs on average 3.03 cycles (on well-assembled
genomes such as the ones used for testing).

(*). The custom scoring matrix contains positive values corresponding to
the alignments of this character with * (any stop codon, Score 8), and with
cysteine (Score 4), as well as with arginine (Score 2) and threonine (Score 1),
since these amino acids have been found aligned to Sec in some eukaryotic
selenoprotein families. The alignment of * with any other amino acid is
scored with —4.

When multiple predictions are present in a exonerate output, only the
main prediction (deﬁned as the highest scoring among those overlapping the
original input ‘superexon’) is reported by selenoproﬁles. Often, however,
exonerate fails to join predictions which actually belong to the same gene,
because no canonical splice sites are found or because a region of the
query sequence that would bridge the predictions is not found in the target
sequence. Therefore, selenoproﬁles uses secondary exonerate predictions to
extend the main one: such predictions must align a region of the proﬁle that
is downstream (upstream) of the region aligned in the main one, and they
should also be located downstream (upstream) in the genome sequence. That
is, co-linearity needs to be maintained.

It is possible that more than one exon per gene initiates the exonerate
cycle. In most of these cases, the procedure just described converges, leading
to the choice of the same query protein and therefore to identical gene
structure predictions. In a few cases, the procedure does not converge and
slightly different gene structures are predicted. Exonerate predictions are
processed to produce a unique gene structure per genomic loci: identical
predictions are considered just once, and predictions which are completely
included within the boundaries of another are discarded. Rarely, partially
overlapping predictions, not including each other, are produced by this
procedure. These will be output separately at the end of the pipeline. Note
that there may be multiple non-overlapping exonerate predictions for a given
selenoprotein proﬁle, which could correspond to different members of the
selenoprotein family. Selenoproﬁles attempts next to reﬁne the exonerate
predictions through genewise.

2.4.2 Genewise Genewise is a program belonging to the Wise2 package
that performs a protein to DNA splice alignment (analogously to exonerate).
Selenoproﬁles utilizes genewise from Wise version 2.2.3. Generally,
genewise is used to reﬁne the gene boundaries of predictions already
produced by exonerate (Fig. 1c). Sometimes, however, the exonerate routine
seeded by a psitblastn hit (or by a ‘superexon’) produces no output. We also
use genewise in these cases to produce a prediction on the genomic interval
outlined by blast and extended by 10 000 bp on each side (genewise ‘to be
sure’isee Fig. 1d). As with exonerate, the query sequence to be used is
chosen from the proﬁle alignment maximizing the sequence similarity to
the predicted peptide sequence in the target. Genewise is run just once, so
the query sequence in the standard routine is always the last one used by
exonerate. When no exonerate output is available, the query sequence is
chosen maximizing the similarity to the target peptide sequence predicted
by psitblastn. Genewise can accept as query also a proﬁle (not only a single
sequence), in the form of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Nonetheless,
selenoproﬁles implements the use of genewise only with single protein
queries, to keep the time of computation acceptable in genome-wide searches.
As with exonerate, genewise is run with a custom scoring matrix favoring the
alignment of Sec with UGA codons, with cysteine codons, or, with a lower
score, with arginine or threonine codons. The query sequence chosen from
the proﬁle is replaced with a ﬂag character (in this case U) in the positions
that are aligned to Sec in the proﬁle. In the case of genewise, though, it is
possible to customize the program behavior to favor only the alignment of
the U with UGA codons (not with other stop codons): this is accomplished
by providing a different codon table to genewise, in which UGA codes for U.

2.4.3 Final prediction At this point, selenoproﬁles compares the genewise
prediction with the prediction by exonerate, and chooses only one of them
(Fig. 1e). In our experience, using the two programs instead of just one
of them improves both the performance and the stability of the pipeline
(Supplementary Section S3). Since the scores of the two programs are not
comparable, selenoproﬁles chooses the prediction with the longest protein
sequence, unless it is likely to correspond to a pseudogene (i.e. it contains
frameshifts or non-Sec coding stop codons), or it does not include a residue
aligned to the Sec position(s) of the proﬁle. In this case, the shorter prediction
is chosen provided that it does not verify these two conditions. In our analysis,
the genewise and exonerate predictions are identical in 27% of the cases.
When they are different, selenoproﬁles chooses the genewise prediction over
the original prediction by exonerate in 68% of the cases. The ﬁnal predictions
are then ﬁltered (see next section).

2.5 Filtering, labeling and outputting

Gene predictions are ﬁltered so that only predictions spanning at least a given
fraction of the proﬁle alignment (40%) or longer than a given threshold (60
amino acids) are reported. All gene predictions that pass this ﬁltering step are
output, producing sequence ﬁles (in fasta format) and gene coordinate ﬁles
[in General Feature Format (GFF), see http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/
software/gff/spec.html]. Each gene prediction is labeled according to the
codon that aligns to Sec in the proﬁle. If a UGA codon is occurring at
this position, the gene is labeled as ‘selenocysteine’. If another codon is
occurring, the label takes the name of the correspondent amino acid (which
is cysteine most of the times). There are some other possible labels, detailed
in the caption of Figure 3.

2.6 SECISearch

Finally, selenoproﬁles utilizes SECISearch version 2.0 (Kryukov at (11.,
1999), as adapted in (Chapple at (11., 2009), to search for potential SECIS
elements in the genomic region downstream from the predicted selenoprotein
genes (Fig. 1f). By default, a region of 3000 bp is scanned. Initially,
selenoproﬁles attemps to ﬁnd SECIS element matching the standard pattern,
which ﬁts both forms of eukaryotic SECISes (Krol, 2002). If no SECISes
are found matching this pattern, SECISearch is run with two increasingly

degenerate SECIS patterns (all patterns are reported in Supplementary
Material, Section Sl). It is possible that more than one SECIS is found
in this way. It is also possible that no SECIS is found at all. Nevertheless,
selenoproﬁles does not drop a prediction for lacking a SECIS prediction. We
believe that in most cases the occurrence of a UGA aligned to a Sec position
of a known selenoprotein family is a very strong evidence for selenoprotein
function. The lack of a detectable SECIS in the genomic region downstream
of a real selenoprotein gene can be due to unusual features of the SECIS,
and also to poor quality in the genome assembly, or to the presence of long
and/or many introns in the 3’ UTR of the candidate.

2.7 Reﬁltering

Some proﬁles report false hits, either because the protein alignment for the
family features poor sequence information (causing spurious hits along the
genome), or because the family shares a certain degree of similarity with
members of some other non-selenoprotein families (causing the proﬁle to
identify these genes). Through our experience with speciﬁc protein families,
we have learnt to recognize these cases, and we have thus implemented a
number of ﬁlters to identify, label and remove them. Filters are speciﬁc of
each selenoprotein family. As an example, the reﬁltering for the SelV family
is as follows. This family is characterized by a long, unstructured N-terminal
domain showing very poor conservation, and a conserved C-terminal region.
The N-terminal region sometimes causes this protein proﬁle to produce many
spurious hits in the genome. Through the reﬁltering, we ignore the hits that
align only in this unstructured N-terminal region.

2.8 Implementation

Selenoproﬁles has been implemented in python. Selenoproﬁles contains a
number of proﬁle alignments and scripts, including a program for graphical
output: selenoproﬁles_drawer.pl (Fig. 3). A Perl program (get_annotation.pl)
is used when searching genomes with annotations in Ensembl. This program
interrogates online the Ensembl database utilizing the Perl Core API,
and retrieve the most similar annotation in Ensembl to each selenoproﬁle
prediction. The database releases for all species considered in this article are
reported in Supplementary Table S2. The code and manual of selenoproﬁles is
available at http://big.crg.cat/services/selenoproﬁles. Selenoproﬁles scanned
the human genome for all the 27 implemented families in 1100 min (~18 h)
in a computer equipped with two double-core Intel(R) Xeon(TM) processors
(2.80 Hz) and 4GB of RAM. About 46% of the time was spent on the SelV
family alone.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluation of selenoproﬁles

We have tested the performance of selenoproﬁles on the genomes
of Homo sapiens (25 selenoproteins and 5 selenoprotein factors),
Drosophila melanogaster (3 selenoproteins and 5 selenoprotein
factors) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (no selenoproteins and no
selenoprotein factors), since these genomes are well annotated in
Ensembl and have all entries in SelenoDB. We ran selenoproﬁles
removing pre-emptively all sequences belonging to the tested
species from the proﬁles alignments. In addiction to the families
already mentioned, we included the methionine sulfoxide reductase
A (MsrA) family as well, since this family is included in SelenoDB
(although it was found as selenoprotein only in Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii; Novoselov et (11., 2002). Overall, selenoproﬁles found
27 out of the 28 selenoprotein genes, 10 out of 10 selenoprotein
factor genes, and 26 out of 28 annotated selenoprotein homologs.

Fig. 3. Graphical summary of non-redundant selenoproﬁles predictions on all Ensembl genomes. The summary have been obtained with the program
selenoproﬁles_drawer. For each species, the numbers in the colored boxes indicate how many hits were found for each protein family (column) and label (box
color). A color-to-label legend is located at the bottom: selenoproteins are in green, cysteine homologs in red and so on. Rare labels (such as ‘glutamine’,
‘tryptophan’ and ‘glutamic acid’) are all indicated with the pink color and cannot be differentiated in the picture. Hits labeled as ‘pseudo’ contain frameshifts
or stop codons other than UGA (these were included in this ﬁgure although they are ﬁltered out by selenoproﬁles). The label ‘uga_containing’ is used when
the only in-frame stop codon(s) are UGAs (not aligned to any See). This is useful since the scoring scheme rarely allows the alignment over a non-Sec
encoding UGA. When no proﬁle See position is aligned, the hit is labeled as ‘gapped’ in case the prediction aligns regions in the proﬁle both upstream and
downstream of the Sec position, ‘unaligned’ otherwise. The label ‘other’ is only for selenoprotein families with more than one See, when none of them are
aligned to a UGA. The selenoprotein machinery families (not containing Sec) are on the right of the ﬁgure. The non-pseudo, non-uga_containing predictions
for these families are labeled as ‘homologue’. A phylogenetic tree serves to indicate the evolutionary position of the investigated species (T.Gabaldon,
personal communication). In the tree, three unresolved nodes were given an arbitrary topology for Visualization purposes. This image can be downloaded at

Selenoprofiles

 

The three genes missed by selenoproﬁles are Drosophila SelK2, and
human SelW1 and SelW2.

SelK2 is a cysteine homolog of SelK, and is located adjacent to
it on the ﬂy genome, confounding selenoproﬁles. The human SelW
proteins (the selenoprotein SelW1 and the cysteine homolog SelW2)
have an exon structure made of very short exons which produces, in
the psitblastn search, e-values that are higher than the threshold. The
sequences are correctly predicted when searching the ncbi human
ESTs database with selenoproﬁles (data not shown).

For selenoproteins (meaning in this case all predictions labeled
‘selenocysteine’), selenoproﬁles produced no false positives in
the yeast and Drosophila genomes (Supplementary Table S3).
In the human genome, ﬁve selenoprotein genes that were not
present among Ensembl or SelenoDB annotations were predicted—
these are very likely to be false positives (Supplementary
Section S5). Regarding the selenoprotein machinery, four false
positives in total were predicted by selenoproﬁles in the three
genomes (Supplementary Section S5). For non-Sec homologs of
selenoproteins, more false positives were predicted (Supplementary
Table S3). Their number depends mostly on the protein family
considered (i.e. on the effectiveness of the reﬁltering steps speciﬁc
to that family).

In addition to assessing whether selenoproﬁles were able to
identify the selenoprotein and machinery genes in complete genomic
sequences, we also evaluated the quality of the exonic structure
inferred by selenoproﬁles for these genes. Predicted and annotated
gene structures were compared and the usual measures of sensitivity
and speciﬁcity at gene, exon and nucleotide level (Burset and
Guigo, 1996) were computed using the script evaluation.pl (E.Eyras,
personal communication). The details of the procedure and the
results appear in Supplementary Table S3. Overall, accuracy
values are comparable (or even higher) with those obtained
through the most accurate automatic gene annotation pipelines:
for selenoproteins, both the average sensitivity and the average
speciﬁcity at the nucleotide level are >90%.

3.2 Using selenoproﬁles to identify selenoproteins in
eukaryotic genomes

To ﬁirther assess both selenoproﬁles and the current status
of selenoprotein annotation in eukaryotic genomes, we ran
selenoproﬁles on all 46 currently available Ensembl genomes (all
eukaryotes). Eight hundred and thirty-seven selenoprotein genes,
925 non-Sec homologs and 236 selenoprotein factors were found. A
summary of the results is given in Figure 3. The ﬁgure, produced by
the program selenoproﬁles_drawer, lists the selenoprotein families
found in the analyzed genomes and the number of genes in
each family, indicating whether these are selenoproteins, cysteine
homologs or contain other amino acids at the Sec position.
Consistent with our assessment in the human, ﬂy and yeast genomes,
results indicate that, while selenoproﬁles ﬁnds most of the known
selenoprotein genes, it also misses some of them. This is due in part
to limitations of the proﬁles, but mostly to the quality of the genome
sequence.

For example, the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Anopheles
gambiae are known to possess the selenoprotein SelK (Chapple
and Guigo, 2008), but their protein sequence is quite distant from
both Drosophila SelK (used to seed the SelK_insect proﬁle) and
vertebrate SelK (with human SelK used to seed the SelK proﬁle).

Consequently, the annotated SelK is missed in these two genomes
by both SelK proﬁles searches. Other genes are missed in the
psitblastn search because of the e-value of the alignment is above
the threshold. In other cases, selenoproteins are not found because of
incompleteness in the genome sequence. Thus, no SPS2 is predicted
by selenoproﬁles in Gallus gallus genome, but this gene can be easily
found searching the EST data available at ncbi for this organism
(data not shown). Other cases of genes that we expect to be present,
but are missed by selenoproﬁles correspond to predictions labeled
as pseudogenes, because of frameshift(s) or infrarne stop codons.
This happens with selenoprotein families as well with machinery
proteins (e.g. SecS in Microcebus murinus and PSTK in Rattus
norvegicus). Since all Ensembl species (apart from S.cerevisi(1e)
possess selenoproteins and therefore must have the necessary
machinery, we believe this suggests the occurrence of sequencing
errors in the genomes. Many genomes included in Ensembl are
characterized by low coverage, and this is known to heavily affect
the inferences on gene presence in such species (Milinkovitch et (11.,
2010). Out of the 837 selenoproteins predicted by selenoproﬁles,
658 of them contain a putative SECIS elements. We ﬁnd a
correspondent gene annotation in Ensembl for 604 of them. In 66
cases, the gene was correctly annotated as a selenoprotein. Given the
low false positive rate of selenoproﬁles, most of the 771 remaining
cases are likely to correspond to misannotations. For the 233 cases
in which no correspondent Ensembl annotation was found, we
believe that the in-frame UGA confounded the Ensembl annotation
pipeline to the point that no annotation at all was produced. Among
the 538 remaining cases, we observed a few recurrent patterns of
misannotation: in 154 (28.6%) cases, the annotated coding region in
Ensembl ends exactly at the Sec-UGA site (mostly for families with
a C-terminal Sec), while in 100 (18.6%) cases starts downstream of
it (for families with a N-terminal/central Sec). In 231 (42.9%) cases,
there is a deletion in the annotated coding region compared with the
selenoproﬁles prediction that includes the Sec-UGA codon. Often
the deletion eliminates only this codon through the annotation of
a 3 bp intron. The 53 (9.9%) remaining cases do not fall in any of
the previous categories. A list of the misannotated genes for each
category is provided as Supplementary Material. Selenoproﬁles
predictions on all Ensembl genomes can be accessed through DAS
at http://genome.crg.cat:9000/das/Selenoproﬁles_ensembl.

4 DISCUSSION

In spite of signiﬁcant advances, gene annotation of newly sequenced
genomes remains a challenging task. While manual curation is still
essential to produce high-quality gene and transcript annotations
(Guigo et (11., 2006), automatic genome annotation pipelines produce
increasingly accurate gene sets (Harrow et (11., 2009), in particular
for well-characterized protein coding families and when other well-
annotated evolutionary close genomes exist. Due to their peculiar
recoding of the standard genetic code, selenoproteins constitute the
most notable exception; even for well-annotated genomes, they are
often mispredicted. Indeed, as we have shown through the analysis
described here, most eukaryotic selenoproteins are misannotated in
the available reference gene sets. Since misannotation invariably
involves the deletion of the region in the protein sequence including
the Sec-UGA—key to proper family assignation—misprediction
in the case of selenoproteins have the additional negative effect,

beyond simply protein truncation, of impairing proper ﬁlnctional
characterization.

Proper annotation of selenoprotein genes—even those belonging
to well-characterized protein families—requires substantial human
intervention. Indeed, due to the degeneration of the sequence
of the SECIS element, and to the complex evolutionary history
of selenoprotein genes, with frequent gene duplications and
family expansions, pseudogenizations, and the yet not completely
understood evolutionary dynamics of Cys to Sec interconversion
(Castellano et (11., 2009), detection of sequence homology is,
in general, not sufﬁcient for correct selenoprotein identiﬁcation.
In fact, the correct annotation of the two dozen (at the most)
selenoprotein genes corresponding to known selenoprotein families,
which may be encoded in a newly sequenced eukaryotic genome
takes, in our experience, 2—3 weeks of full-time work of an
experienced scientist. He/she has to browse through a maze of
multiple sequence alignments and SECIS predictions, making often
ad hoc decisions, which generally involve running additional,
more sophisticated alignment programs and post-processing their
output. In selenoproﬁles, we have attempted to encapsulate the
experience that we have accumulated during the years in manual
identiﬁcation of selenoproteins. Selenoproﬁles includes standard
sequence similarity search and sequence alignment programs
together with custom made post-processing scripts and a number
of rules that direct the overall ﬂow of the process. The core
of selenoproﬁles is a set of very high-quality multiple sequence
alignments for the different selenoprotein families and subfamilies.
Given that we know a priori which positions in a proﬁle alignment
are allowed to bear a selenocysteine, selenoproﬁles favors the
alignment to UGA codons only if these are aligned to one such
position. Therefore, an important feature of each proﬁle alignment
is the position or positions that contain Sec, and one of the major
determinants of the efﬁciency of the selenoproﬁles pipeline are the
species and the subfamilies represented in the proﬁle. Selenoproﬁles
automatically selects the best sequence to be used as query from the
proﬁle. Consequently, if the proﬁle contains at least one sequence
that is very similar to the protein coded by the gene that is predicting,
the prediction will be accurate. But if the most similar sequence in
the proﬁle differs from the real protein encoded in the investigated
genome in the presence or absence of some domains, or if there
is poor conservation between the two sequences at some regions
(often at one or both ends), then the prediction may be inaccurate.
Input proﬁle alignments for selenoproﬁles should, therefore, be as
consistent, complete and representative as possible. In this regard, as
new genomes are being analyzed, we keep updating selenoproﬁles,
and we are working in a procedure to substantially automate this
updating.

While selenoproﬁles does not completely eliminate the need
for manual intervention, it dramatically reduces it. We estimate
that, after running selenoproﬁles on a (newly sequenced) genome,
an experienced scientist will need, in general, only a few hours
to produce a high-quality annotation of the selenoprotein genes
corresponding to known families in the genome. But, given its
low false positive rate, even the default output of selenoproﬁles
will generally be a much superior annotation of selenoprotein genes
than that produced by automatic annotation pipelines—including the
most sophisticated ones. In this regard, we believe that selenoproﬁles
would be a useﬁil complement of such pipelines, and we are
working on a method to automatically correct the misannotated

selenoproteins taking into account the selenoproﬁles output. Using
directly this output may not be an option, since sophisticated
annotation pipelines rely on transcript information (such as ESTs
and cDNA sequences), as well as genomic sequence conservation
across species, and the overall gene structure delineated using
this information is likely to be superior to the one delineated
by selenoproﬁles, with the exception of the region including
the Sec-UGA. Therefore, a better strategy will be to conciliate
the selenoproﬁles prediction with the annotated gene, giving
predominance to the selenoproﬁles prediction in the region (exon)
containing the Sec-UGA, but to the annotated prediction in the rest
of the gene/transcript.

One limitation of selenoproﬁles is that it predicts, with a few
exceptions only one transcript per gene. Nonetheless, if alternative
splicing forms (Sec/non-Sec) exist for a gene, the pipeline is likely
to pick the Sec containing transcript, or one of them, due to
the scoring scheme used. If selenoproﬁles is used on transcribed
sequences (such as ESTs, cDNAs, or RNA sequences) instead
of genomic sequences, it could potentially produce predictions
for multiple splicing isoforms of selenoprotein genes. While we
have developed and tested selenoproﬁles to annotate eukaryotic
selenoproteomes, the strategy that we have employed can be easily
ported to prokaryotic genomes as well. This requires the building
and curation of the corresponding proﬁles, the usage of the bacterial
and archaeal SECIS patterns, and the modiﬁcation of some of the
selenoproﬁles rules.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Selenoproﬁles is an homology-based method to produce accurate
predictions of known selenoprotein families, and can be used
in conjunction with automatic annotation pipelines. Running
selenoproﬁles on all available eukaryotic genomes reveals
hundreds of misannotated selenoprotein genes. Selenoproﬁles
predictions constitute the largest available collection of eukaryotic
selenoproteins, and are in this regard, an invaluable resource for
selenoprotein research.

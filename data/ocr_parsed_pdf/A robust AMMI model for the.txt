Abstract

Motivation: One of the most widely used models to analyse genotype—by—environment data is the
additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model. Genotype—by—environment data
resulting from multi—location trials are usually organized in two—way tables with genotypes in the
rows and environments (location—year combinations) in the columns. The AMMI model applies sin—
gular value decomposition (SVD) to the residuals of a specific linear model, to decompose the
genotype—by—environment interaction (GEI) into a sum of multiplicative terms. However, SVD,
being a least squares method, is highly sensitive to contamination and the presence of even a
single outlier, if extreme, may draw the leading principal component towards itself resulting in pos—
sible misinterpretations and in turn lead to bad practical decisions. Since, as in many other real—life
studies the distribution ofthese data is usually not normal due to the presence of outlying observa—
tions, either resulting from measurement errors or sometimes from individual intrinsic characteris—
tics, robust SVD methods have been suggested to help overcome this handicap.

Results: We propose a robust generalization of the AMMI model (the R—AMMI model) that over—
comes the fragility of its classical version when the data are contaminated. Here, robust statistical
methods replace the classic ones to model, structure and analyse GEI. The performance of the ro—
bust extensions of the AMMI model is assessed through a Monte Carlo simulation study where
several contamination schemes are considered. Applications to two real plant datasets are also
presented to illustrate the benefits of the proposed methodology, which can be broadened to both
animal and human genetics studies.

1 Introduction

 

Multi-environment trials (MET), which comprise experiments
across multiple locations, are important tools for testing both broad
and narrow genotype adaptation. Here, when two different geno-
types show a differential response to a prototypic trait (e.g. yield)
across environments, it is said that genotype-hy-environment inter-
action (GEI) is present. Data from MET are often summarized in

two-way tables of means with genotypes in the rows (columns) and
environments (location-year combinations) in the columns (rows).
The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI)
model (Gauch, 1988, 1992) is one of the most widely used tools to
analyse and structure GEI. This model works under a fixed-model
framework and is fit in two stages. First, the main effects of the
model are estimated using the additive two-way analysis of variance

Robust AMMI model for the analysis of genotype—by—environment data 59

 

(ANOVA) by least squares. Then, the singular value decomposition
(SVD) is applied to the residuals from the ANOVA, i.e. to the inter—
action, to obtain the estimates for the multiplicative terms of the
AMMI model. The AMMI model, in its standard form, implicitly
assumes equal weights for all entries of the two—way dataset and
that no outliers (leverage points) are present in the data. Rodrigues
et al. (2014) proposed a weighted AMMI algorithm where different
weights to columns and/or rows and or particular cells of the two—
way data table are given, and used this generalization to study GEI
and quantitative trait loci (QTL)—by—environment interactions.
However, their approach does not fully solve the problem that arises
from contaminated data—a problem that is common in field data
such as data resulting from MET—because of the difficulty in defin—
ing the weights associated with possible outlying observations. As a
consequence, the results from the analysis using standard methods
may be biased leading to possible misinterpretations, which in turn
may result in bad practical decisions.

Since the reason behind these biases lies on the fact that: (i) least—
squares regression/ANOVA method does not perform well in the
presence of outlying observations, which often tend to pull the re—
gression line towards them and consequently compromise inference
results; (ii) SVD is a technique essentially based on the computation
of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the sample covariance/correlation
matrix, and is thus highly sensitive to the presence of atypical obser—
vations; it seems natural that an upgrade of this method may be
achieved by improving the performance of the intermediate
ANOVA and SVD steps.

Robust statistical methods are designed to overcome the handi—
caps of traditional methods that are felt when one or more assump—
tions of the model of analysis are not fulfilled. These violations
often translate in biased parameter estimation, underpowered asso—
ciation tests, unreliable confidence intervals and so forth (Huber,
1981). Therefore, and since data contamination is more a rule than
an exception when real—life data are considered, there has been
growing interest in the use of these statistical methodologies which
allow for valid results even if model assumptions are violated (Copt
and Heritier, 2007; Lourenco et al., 2011). Interest that is also ex—
plained by the fact that throughout the years the associated compu—
tational burden has been substantially reduced.

To overcome the problem of analysing two—way contaminated
data and to better understand GEI, we introduce in this study a ro—
bust AMMI model where the linear fit, underlying the ANOVA
method, is replaced by a robust fit (M—regression; Huber, 1964) and
the use of the standard SVD by a robust SVD approach (see a review
in Filzmoser and Todorov, 2013). We underline that in the AMMI
model the main effects are considered to be fixed and the errors nor—
mally distributed, although other extensions have already been pro—
posed in the literature (Piepho, 1997; Smith et al., 2001; Tsujitani,
1992). Hadi (2011) also proposed an alternative procedure of han—
dling outliers in two—way tables by using robust alternating regres—
sion, based on factor analytic ANOVA models and robust
projection pursuit principal component analysis, to ‘robustify’ the
AMMI model. However, instead of dealing with a two—stage model
(first fitting the additive part of the AMMI model and then the
multiplicative), Hadi (2011) estimates the additive and multiplica—
tive terms simultaneously.

The performance of the proposed robust extensions of the
AMMI model is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations where
several contamination schemes are considered. The methods are also
compared with the results obtained via the classical AMMI model
according to several criteria. Here, the good features of the
R—AMMI model are displayed. An application of the methodology

to two real datasets is also presented to illustrate the benefits of this
approach.

We highlight that the range of possible applications of a robust
AMMI model is wide, spanning from plant genetics such as QTL de—
tection and QTL—by—environment interaction studies (Gauch et al.,
2011; Rodrigues et al., 2014; Romagosa et al., 1996), to microarray
experiments (Crossa et al., 2005), ribosomal DNA studies (Adams
et al., 2002), plant and microbial populations” growth across several
environmental conditions (Culman et al., 2009), animal sciences
(Barhdadi and Dube, 2010) and human genetics (Mukherjee et al.,
2012).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 AMMI model

The AMMI model combines the features of ANOVA and SVD as
follows: first the ANOVA estimates the additive main effects of the
two—way data table; then the SVD is applied to the residuals from
the additive ANOVA model, estimating N g min(I — 1,] — 1) inter—
action principal components (IPCs). Here, I represents the number
of genotypes (rows) and ] the number of environments (columns)
considered in the study and described in the two—way data table.
Assuming for simplicity a completely randomized design for individ—
ual trials, the model can be written as (Gauch, 1992):

N
yiJJz I H + “i + I}; + Z 4nVi.n5n./' + Pi.) + 613,112, (1)

where 31,313), is the phenotypic trait (yield or some other quantitative
trait of interest) of the ith genotype in the jth environment for repli—
cate k; y is the grand mean; or, are the genotype deviations from )4; [ii
are the environment deviations from y; in is the singular value of the
IPC analysis axis 11; vi.” and 5,1,; are the 1th and ith genotype and en—
vironment IPC scores (i.e. the left and right singular vectors, scaled
as unit vectors) for axis 11, respectively; p),- is the residual containing
all multiplicative terms not included in the model; 6,3,3), is the experi—
mental error; and N is the number of principal components retained
in the model.
In matrix formulation the AMMI model can be written as:

Y:1,1}p+u,1}+1,pf+UDVT+g, (2)

where Y is the (I X ]) two—way table of genotypic means across trials
or environments. Each column of Y represents the vector of geno—
typic means as obtained from the phenotypic analysis of a corres—
ponding trial by an appropriate mixed model analysis that accounts
for experimental design features and/or spatial trends. 111;“ is a
(I X ]) matrix with the grand mean u in all positions, 5(11T is a (I ><])
matrix of genotype main effects (equal rows), and 111},- is a (I ><])
matrix of environmental main effects (equal columns). The inter—
action part of the model Y" : Y — 111;“ — 5:11}- — 1113;1- is approxi—
mated by the product of matrices UDVT, with U an (I X N) matrix
whose columns contain the left singular vectors of the interaction, D
a (N X N) diagonal matrix containing the singular values of Y", and
V a (] X N) matrix whose columns contain the right singular vectors
of Y". The residual term in Equation (2), the (I X ]) matrix 8, in—
cludes both the lack of fit term and the error term of model (1).

The choice of the number of multiplicative terms in the
model, N, is of key importance and must be done carefully as it will
affect the subsequent results (Gauch, 2013). Dias and Krzanowski
(2003, 2006) generalized a cross—validation—based method originally
developed for principal component analysis (Eastment and

Krzanowski, 1982) to be used in the AMMI model. A more recent
approach on how to choose the number of components in the
AMMI model was proposed by Forkman and Piepho (2014), which
was based on parametric bootstrap resampling.

2.2 Robust AMMI model

To overcome the problem of data contamination with outlying ob—
servations, we propose a robust AMMI model, which can be ob—
tained in two stages as follows: (i) use the robust regression based
on the M—Huber estimator (Huber, 1981) to replace the ANOVA
model; and (ii) use a robust SVD/PCA procedure to replace the
standard SVD. In the second stage, we will consider several meth—
ods, briefly described below, thus conveying a total of five robust
AMMI candidate models:

R-AMMI: robust SVD (Hawkins et al., 2001): uses the L1 norm in—
stead of the more usual least squares L2 norm, to compute a ro—
bust approximation to the SVD of a rectangular matrix. This
method is not robust in the presence of leverage points.

H-AMMI: robust PCA (Hubert et al., 2005): Combines projection—
pursuit (PP) and robust covariance estimation (minimum covari—
ance determinant) techniques to compute the robust loadings. It is
most adequate for high—dimensional data.

G-AMMI: robust grid algorithm (Croux et al., 2007): Uses PP to
compute PCA estimators. The optimization is done via the grid
search algorithm in the plane instead of the p—dimensional space.

L-AMMI: robust spherical PCA (Locantore et al., 1999): Uses a
spherical principal components procedure. The idea behind this
approach is to perform classical PCA on the data but projected
onto a unit sphere. When the data are elliptically distributed the
estimates of the eigenvectors are consistent. In addition, this is an
extremely fast procedure.

PP-AMMI: robust PP (Croux and Ruiz-Galen, 2005 ): Uses PP calcu—
lating the robust eigenvalues and eigenvectors without going
through robust covariance estimation. The principal components
can be sequentially computed and thus this method is very appeal—
ing in 17 >> 11 problems, which, in the case of MET and AMMI
modelling, are found when few genotypes are evaluated under a
wide range of environmental and/or experimental conditions.

The robust methods described are available in the R software in
packages MASS, pcaMethods and rrcov via functions rlm() ,
robustSVD() , PcaHubert () , PcaGrid() , PcaLocantore ()
and PcaProj () , respectively. More details on the methods can be
found in Maronna (2005), Todorov and Filzmoser (2009) and
Filzmoser and Todorov (2013).

3 Simulation study

We simulate m : 1000 two—way data tables with n : 100 rows/geno—
types and p : 8 columns/environments each, where the interaction is
explained by two multiplicative terms (i.e. two IPCs; k :2 compo—
nents to be retained). Without loss of generality, the two—way data
tables are simulated in the following way:

i. Create a matrix X with n : 100 rows/genotypes and p : 8
columns/environments with observations drawn from a
Unifl—0.5, 0.5] distribution;

ii. Do the SVD of X and obtain the matrices U, V and D, contain—
ing, respectively, the left and right singular vectors and the sin—
gular values of X;

iii. Simulate the grand mean, the genotypic and environmental main
effects, considering: y N N(15, 3), or N N(5, 1) and I} ~ N(8,2);

iv. Simulate a two—way data table Y with AMMI2 structure: Y :
111,54 + 9:11} + 11p} + 28 X U[,1]D[1,1]V[,1]T + 111;} + 15><
U), 2]D[2,2]V[,2]T, where A), i] represents the 1th, 1' : 1,2, col—
umn of the matrix A and Ali, 1'] represents the cell in the row i
and column 1', i : 1, 2, of the matrix A.

The number of multiplicative terms is confirmed by the cross—valid—
ation procedure generalized by Dias and Krzanowski (2003, 2006)
and by the parametric bootstrap—based method proposed by
Forkman and Piepho (2014).

Having the good non—contaminated data, a percentage of con—
tamination is introduced in the two—way original data table so as to
be consistent with the known shift and point mass outliers described
in Rocke and Woodruff (1996): the bad data are generated from the
normal distributions N(y,+ (60,2, 0,2) (pure shift outliers), N04,,
0/2/100) (pure point—mass outliers) and N(y,+ka,2, 012/100) (shift—
point—mass outliers) where k : 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 units, and y, and 0,2
are taken as the sample phenotypic mean and sample phenotypic
variance according to the correspondent environment /. The bad
data replace a percentage of the good data from the two—way table
at the assigned positions for three scenarios:

i. positions randomly selected in the two—way table thus randomly
assigning contamination in different environments for distinct
genotypes (2, 5 8C 10% scattered contamination);

ii. positions randomly assigned in only one of the environments (5,
10, 15 8C 20% single-environment contamination); and

iii. a mix between (i) and (ii), i.e. one of the environments is as—
signed a percentage of contamination (5, 10, 15 8C 20%) and
then scattered contamination is considered in the rest of the
two—way table, excluding this environment and up to a given
total percentage (2, 5 & 10%)—a more realistic scenario
(mixed contamination).

Method comparison is achieved using four criteria:

1. the mean percentage of explained variability (MPEV)

In each run of the simulation, the AMMI and robust AMMI mod—
els are used to analyse the data. The best performing method is
the one that: (i) minimizes the MSE (meaning that the estimated
eigenvalues are closer to the real ones); (ii) gives values of MPEV
closest to 100% (the least overestimation the better); and (iii)
gives the lowest maxsub values (meaning that the estimated com—
ponents are correct). The best performing methods according to

shift shift

Fig. 2. Observed MSE ratios under scattered contamination for both the first (first row) and second (second row) principal components (shift outliers)

being only surpassed by H—AMMI for lower percentages of contam—
ination and larger shifts (2% with k : 7; 2 865% with k : 10;
Supplementary Table 35). As to the standard AMMI method, it pro—
gressively performs worse and worse as the degree of shift increases.
At the k : 7, 10 shift scenarios it is the poorest performing method
(Supplementary Table 35).

In order to compare the maxsub values for the proposed meth—
ods, boxplots (based on the 1000 simulations) were obtained for
every combination (shift, percentage of contamination, type of con—
tamination). In general, L—AMMI consistently gives the lowest max-
sub values across scattered contamination scenarios (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. SS). Even in the worst case scenario (10% shift—
10 scattered contamination) its observed median values stay under
0.2. The H—AMMI model gives the overall second best results, being
very similar to L—AMMI for lower percentages of contamination but
deteriorating with the increase of both the degree of shift and the
percentage of contamination (Supplementary Fig. SS). As for R—
AMMI, it is clearly the worst performing method, even worse per—
forming than AMMI in most cases.

In the case of single—environment contamination scenarios, H—
AMMI is the best performing method keeping the observed maxsub
values close to 0 across shifts and levels of contamination
(Supplementary Figs 65 and 75). Here L—AMMI performs as good as
H—AMMI for lower percentages of contamination (Supplementary
Fig. 65) but does not keep up with the former when the percentage
of contamination increases (Supplementary Fig. 75). R—AMMI per—
forms in general better than AMMI but still with poor results when
compared with the other robust counterparts.

With respect to the mixed scenarios, Supplementary Figures 85—
125 show that L—AMMI performs better than the other robust meth—
ods across all shifts and single—environment contamination levels in
the case of 5 8C 10% overall contamination, giving place to H—
AMMI in the 2% overall contamination scenario but with small

differences. In general, in this setting both AMMI and R—AMMI
models give the highest maxsub values.

4.1.2 Pure point-mass outliers

We observe through the MSE ratio plots (Supplementary Fig. 135)
that R—AMMI provides the smallest observed MSEs amongst all ro—
bust methods for the IPC1 in the single—environment scenario and
also in the scattered one but for lower levels of contamination. With
respect to the IPC2, L—AMMI produces, in general, the highest ratios
and thus the lowest MSE values. However, R—AMMI is the second
best performing method in terms of observed MSEs for the IPC2
with values quite close to those of L—AMMI. When mixed contamin—
ation is considered, Supplementary Figure 145 shows that R—AMMI
is the best method in the case of 2&5% scattered contamination
for the IPC1, across all single—environment contamination levels,
and the second best for the IPC2 (10% scattered with 20% single—
environment contamination scenario excluded). In the 10% scat—
tered contamination scenario however, the best results for IPC1 are
obtained by PP—AMMI. The L—AMMI model shows the best per—
formance regarding the MSE in the case of IPC2.

Supplementary Table 45 shows that, when considering both scat—
tered and single—environment contamination, R—AMMI keeps values
of MPEV close to the ones obtained with the AMMI method, always
under 100%, whereas all the other methods tend to overestimate
this value across all contamination levels.

In the case of the mixed scenario, the classic AMMI and the R—
AMMI methods perform similarly (Supplementary Table SS), keep—
ing the MPEV values under 100% as desired, in contrast to the re—
maining methods (except for L—AMMI in the case of 10% scattered
contamination) which tend to overestimate the 100% threshold. In
the case of the 10% scattered contamination scenario L—AMMI is
the best performing method.

environments, during 1991 and 1992, in the United States and
Canada. Following Rodrigues et al. (2014), two multiplicative terms
were considered in the AMMI model. Supplementary Figure 225
shows the biplots obtained with the AMMI and R—AMMI (the robust
model which performed better in the numerical example)
approaches considering two IPCs for the analysis.

In the biplot of the classic AMMI model (left—hand side of
Supplementary Fig. 225) the environment OR91 shows a dominant
effect over the biplot being non—correlated with most of other envir—
onments. This biplot also presents an overlap in the direction of
many of the loadings for the environments which makes it difficult
to interpret and to analyse. When considering the R—AMMI method—
ology (right—hand side of Supplementary Fig. 225) the interpretation
of the biplot seems easier, with the environments more spread, dif—
ferent angles between their components loadings and without such
dominant influence of a given environment. These results are con—
sistent with Gauch et al. (2011) where the environment OR91 was
considered to be an outlying environment after conducting a QTL
analysis. Moreover, the use of the R—AMMI model made it possible
for this particular environment to be included in the analysis with—
out distorting the final results, which was achieved by reducing its
influence on the final model. To conclude, this example application
further reinforces the usefulness of the proposed methodology.

Dataset 2: Durum wheat mapping population

The second real dataset used in this study is the result of a breed—
ing programme carried out by the Portuguese National Plant
Breeding Station in the years of 1992/1993 and 1993/1994 and in—
cludes nine genotypes and 11 environments. Following the results of
Rodrigues et al. (2011), two multiplicative terms were considered to
fit the AMMI and R—AMMI models. Supplementary Figure 235
shows the biplots obtained with the two approaches considering
the first two IPCs for the analysis. The biplots do not show major
differences between themselves. This can be a result of the fact that
in this particular study, genotypes with proven strong adaptability
were used. As such, no major differences between yields are seen
and thus there are no anomalous observations in this sense. Also,
this dataset probably does not have a significant number of measure—
ment errors.

5 Discussion

This study outlines the fragility of the classical AMMI model when
the two—way data table is contaminated, which often is the case in
MET, either, because measurement errors have occurred, some pest/
disease have influenced some genotypes in a given environment re—
sulting, e.g. in a lower—than—expected yield, or even due to some in—
herent characteristics of the genotypes being measured. Although we
have considered in the simulation study some extreme contamin—
ation scenarios for illustration purposes alone, even in the more
plausible contamination scenarios the classical methodology re—
sulted in higher values of MSE and MPEV due to the overestimation
of the eigenvalues, greater maxsub values and, as seen in the numer—
ical example, biplots harder to interpret. Here, the use of the robust
R—AMMI method, besides providing results similar to the classical
AMMI model when there was no data contamination (maxsub val—
ues excluded; observed values not critical), it also gave overall better
results when the data were contaminated (maxsub values again
excluded although very high values were observed in many situ—
ations): least biased estimated eigenvalues (i.e. in general lower IPC1
MSE values), less overestimation of the true mean proportion of

explained variability and more parsimonious biplots. We underline
that the high observed maxsub values of R—AMMI are not at all crit—
ical since maxsub only assesses subspaces and is only a good meas—
ure of comparison when the goal is the selection of the components,
which is not the case in this study. The R—AMMI direct competitor
in the simulations, H—AMMI, although giving low maxsub values,
showed high IPC1 MSE values even under the assumption of no con—
tamination, greater tendency to overestimate the MPEV 100%
threshold (scattered and mixed scenarios mainly) and failed to pro—
vide easy interpretable biplots in many situations.

Despite the fact that this simulation study was made for the
AMMI model with two multiplicative terms for simplicity, the re—
sults would be similar for a more complex model such as the
AMMI3 or AMMI4 models as all the robust procedures allow for
more components than two. In practice, the main difference would
be the biplot comparison which has a more complex structure (e.g.
two biplots for the AMMI3: (i) first and second components; and
(ii) first and third components) for the AMMI model with more
multiplicative terms. In those cases, the best way to compare
the methods would be to use the MSE of the predicted yield values
and, in the case of the biplots, either the Procrustes statistic
(Dryden and Mardia, 1998) or the root mean square statistic pro—
posed by Shin et al. (2008). For real data examples with more than
two components, the strategy for the robust AMMI would be the
same as for the AMMI model, i.e. to make the comparisons based
on the sum of squares provided by the ANOVA tables, based on the
model predicted values, and based on biplots with pairs of multi—
plicative terms.

The employ of the robust version of the AMMI model may be
extremely useful for practitioners because a bad representation of
genotypes and environments in the biplots (as happens in the
Steptoe and Morex study—Supplementary Fig. 225) can result in a
bad decision regarding which genotypes to choose for a given set of
environments (i.e. mega—environments; Gauch and Zobel, 1997;
Yan et al., 2000). In turn, the choice of the wrong genotypes for the
environments due to data contamination might result in big losses in
terms of yield production—a problem that also occurs when the
choice of the number of IPCs to consider in the AMMI model is not
properly chosen (Forkman and Piepho, 2014).

Although the robust AMMI model presented in this article has
shown to provide very good results and thus has a huge potential, it
is not suitable to analyse every two—way data table. For instance,
when the data have only significant main effects (i.e. no interaction),
the interaction should be ignored and the family of AMMI models is
not useful. When data are replicated and some summary measure
such as error variance for the environments can be computed, the
weighted AMMI algorithm proposed by Rodrigues et al. (2014)
might be preferable as the weights can be obtained a priori.
However, when there is interaction in the data, data contamination
is present and there are difficulties in defining the weights associated
with possible outlying observations, then the robust AMMI model
should be used. It should also be noted that important features such
as the ANOVA, showing the proportion of sums of squares due to
the main effects, and each successive IPCs are possible to obtain for
the robust AMMI model. Moreover, the robust biplots will keep the
characteristics and standard interpretation as the ones produced via
the AMMI model. Despite all the advantages of the robust AMMI
model, as in any other data analysis strategy, caution should be exer—
cised when analysing the data. In particular, cleaning detectable
measurement errors from the data and a preliminary descriptive
analysis should be made. These missing points can then be imputed
before the modelling (Paderewski and Rodrigues, 2014). As an

example of the usefulness of the preliminary descriptive analysis,
one can think of the case where a regional trial has both irrigated
and no—irrigated plots, which can result in wide yield differences
within an environment. In this case it might be more appropriate to
analyse such a yield trial as two separate subsets instead of combin—
ing all data in one single analysis.

The proposed robust R—AMMI model may also be useful in other
studies where data contamination is inevitable, e.g. in QTL detec—
tion and QTL—by—environment interaction studies. In that case, the
robust AMMI model may be used, instead of its classical counter—
part, to calculate more accurate predicted values when fitting the
model which can then be subject to a QTL analysis in a two—stage
procedure, similar to the ones described in Romagosa et al. (1996),
Gauch et al. (2011) and Rodrigues et al. (2014). Further compari—
sons in terms of QTL detection and QTL—by—environment inter—
action, between standard (Gauch et al., 2011), weighted (Rodrigues
et al., 2014) and robust AMMI models, should be done in future
work to reinforce the usefulness of the robust AMMI model. Also,
the ideas behind this robust approach may also be incorporated in
the genotype main effects and genotype—by—environment interaction
effects (GGE) model, which, as the AMMI model, is also very popu—
lar in MET studies (Yan et al., 2000). The main difference between
the two is that in the GGE model SVD is performed on the matrix of
residuals from a one—way ANOVA with fixed effects for environ—
ments only instead of a two—way ANOVA with fixed effects of geno—
types and environments. Further extensions and applications of the
proposed methodology can be done, not only for animal and human
genetics applications, but also in other fields as the AMMI model is
also known in the literature as double—centered principal component
analysis.

The use of this robust version of the AMMI model, and others
that have shown preliminary good performances (Hadi, 2011) or
that may subsequently follow [e.g. based on the methods of Jung
(2010) and Zhang et al. (2013)], will allow practitioners to make
better strategic decisions. Therefore, this discussion is another step
forward in the direction of the development and use of more robust
and thus more accurate methods, not only in this field of application
but in all others where data fail to comply with classical model
assumptions.

Abstract

Motivation: Ribosome profiling is a useful technique for studying translational dynamics and quan—
tifying protein synthesis. Applications of this technique have shown that ribosomes are not uni—
formly distributed along mRNA transcripts. Understanding how each transcript—specific distribu—
tion arises is important for unraveling the translation mechanism.

Results: Here, we apply kernel smoothing to construct predictive features and build a sparse model
to predict the shape of ribosome footprint profiles from transcript sequences alone. Our results on
Saccharomyces cerevisiae data show that the marginal ribosome densities can be predicted with
high accuracy. The proposed novel method has a wide range of applications, including inferring
isoform—specific ribosome footprints, designing transcripts with fast translation speeds and dis—
covering unknown modulation during translation.

1 Introduction

Gene expression is a fundamental biological process consisting of
two parts: transcription of mRNAs from DNAs and translation of
proteins from mRNAs. Studying the genome—wide dynamics of both
processes is crucial for understanding how cells function and re—
spond to various environmental conditions, thereby giving rise to
the impressive complexity of living organisms. Due to technological
challenges, translation has not been studied as extensively as tran—
scription, but recent advances in experimental protocol and
sequencing technology are providing an unprecedented opportunity
to examine the translation process at base—pair resolution.

Ribosome profiling (Ingolia et al., 2009; Ingolia, 2014) applies ei—
ther translation inhibitors or a ﬂash—freeze protocol to immobilize the
ribosomes ‘Walking’ along the transcript, and the ribosome—occupied
regions (each of length 28—30 nucleotides) can then be extracted and
sequenced, providing detailed positional information about ribosomes.
Such snapshots of ribosome footprints enable quantitative monitoring
and analysis of translational dynamics, making ribosome profiling an
important technique for studying protein synthesis. In particular, it has
been shown that protein abundance correlates better with ribosome
densities than with mRNA abundance (Ingolia et al., 2009).

Various factors may inﬂuence the translation mechanism. It has
been proposed that the differential usage of synonymous codons,

also known as the codon usage bias, is driven by evolutionary forces
to facilitate translation speed (Burgess—Brown et al., 2008; Gardin
et al., 2014; Maertens et al., 2010; Qian et al., 2012; Tuller et al.,
2010b). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that transcripts
with wobble base—pairing encounter slower elongation (Stadler and
Fire, 201 1), and also by the analysis of tRNA—adaptation index (tAI)
(Tuller et al., 20103, 2011). Another hypothesis associates the
mRNA secondary structure with translation efficiency, in particular
near initiation sites (Kertesz et al., 2010, 2012; Kudla et al., 2009;
Gu et al., 2010; Tuller et al., 2010b, 2011; Zur and Tuller, 2012).
Studies have found that initiation is the rate—limiting factor of trans—
lation and that ribosome densities tend to be higher near initiation
sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ingolia et al., 2009; Shah et al.,
2013). Also, positively charged residues on nascent peptides have
been found to inﬂuence the footprint abundance (Charneski and
Hurst, 2013; Lareau et al., 2014; Tuller et al., 2011). We refer the
reader to Ingolia (2014) for a review of the major findings from uti—
lizing ribosome profiling.

Although the debate surrounding the main determinant of trans—
lational dynamics remains open, the above—mentioned hypotheses
have one thing in common; that is, the transcript sequence context
plays an important role in governing the efficiency of translation.
Hence, investigating how transcript—specific distributions arise and
to what extent they depend on the transcript sequence is essential to

understanding the translation mechanism. Motivated by this obser—
vation and the fact that ribosome footprint profiles are generally not
uniformly distributed, we consider here the statistical problem of
predicting marginal densities of ribosome footprints from the tran—
script sequence information alone.

We first apply wavelet analysis to decouple global shapes from
local patterns of ribosome marginal densities. Then, by building
sparse models to predict the marginal densities projected onto the
subspace corresponding to each scale and using asymmetric kernel
smoothing, we identify the codon features that best associate with a
given scale and estimate the extent to which they inﬂuence the ribo—
some densities. Results on S. cerevisiae ribosome footprints show that
the sequence content is highly predictive of the marginal densities at
steady state. The ability to predict the marginal densities based solely
on transcript sequences has many potential applications. For example,
it can be used to guide the design of transcripts with optimal transla—
tion speeds in synthetic biology; comparing the steady—state prediction
with profiles under various conditions may help to uncover unknown
post—transcriptional regulation factors; and the predicted marginal
density can serve as a prior in probabilistically mapping reads in the
inference of isoform—specific ribosome footprints.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our
proposed method, which consists of the ‘A’ site (decoding site where
the aminoacyl tRNA arrives) identification, wavelet decomposition,
kernel smoothing and sparse regression model. In Section 3, we test
the performance of our method on ribosome profiling data of S. cer-
evisiae. We then conclude with a discussion of our findings.

2 Methods

2.1 Ribosome footprint alignment and the 'A’ site
identification

The first step of ribosome profiling is immobilizing the ribosomes
on transcripts, which can be accomplished by the application of
cycloheximide (CHX), proposed by Ingolia et al. (2009). Then, by
nuclease digestion, the fragments of the transcript protected by the
ribosomes are retained. After converting these footprints into DNA
molecules for deep sequencing, one can measure the abundance of
footprints at each position along a transcript.

We considered four publicly available datasets of ribosome
profiling footprints of S. cerevisiae treated with CHX, available at
the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession GSE13750,
GSE52119, GSE34438 and GSE55400, and published in the recent
literature (Albert et al., 2014; Ingolia et al., 2009; McManus et al.,
2014). We analyzed the ribosome footprints of wild type S. cerevi—
siae under normal conditions to study the steady—state behavior. The
footprint reads were first processed to remove the adapters and trim
the poly—A tails, according to published protocols (Albert et al.,
2014; Ingolia et al., 2009; McManus et al., 2014). The reads were
then mapped to the yeast genome, available at the Saccharomyces
Genome Database. Reads with alignment against sequences of RNA
genes (rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs and ncRNAs) of S. cere-
visiae were filtered out, and the remaining reads were aligned
against the ORF genomic sequences or the ORF coding sequences.

There are three active ribosomal sites: the A (arrival), P (poly—
peptide) and E (exit) sites, where aminoacyl tRNA arrives for decod—
ing, the polypeptide is created and the uncharged tRNA exits,
respectively (Fig. 1). We considered reads of length 28, 29 and 30
nucleotides, and focused on the A sites of these ribosome footprints.
For a 28—nucleotide footprint read, the A site typically starts at the
16th nucleotide downstream of the 5’ end of the read (Ingolia et al.,
2009; Lareau et al., 2014). If that position does not correspond to

the first nucleotide of a codon, then, as illustrated in Figure 1, the
start position of the A site was adjusted so that it is at either the
15th or the 17th nucleotide, depending on the amount of shift. We
applied the same procedure for 29—nucleotide reads. For 30—nucleo—
tide reads, the A site was inferred to start at the 16th, the 17th, or
the 18th nucleotide downstream of the 5’ end. Marginal probability
density functions of the footprints were obtained by normalizing the
histograms of the inferred A site footprint counts along each tran—
script. Figure 2 shows an example of the marginal density function
of CHX—treated ribosome footprints.

We also considered the ribosome footprints obtained using the
ﬂash—freeze protocol without CHX pre—treatment (Weinberg et al.,
2016). These footprints are publicly available at the NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus under accession GSE53313.

2.2 Wavelet decomposition

Wavelet transformation has been widely used for analyzing signals.
Its time—frequency localization (Daubechies, 1990) and multiresolu—
tion capability (Mallat, 1989) have proved extremely useful for ap—
plications of denoising (Donoho, 1995; Donoho and Johnstone,
1998; Donoho et al., 1995; Johnstone and Silverman, 1997), density
estimation (Donoho et al., 1996; Kerkyacharian and Picard, 1992),
data compression (Chambolle et al., 1998; Chang et al., 2000;
Villasenor et al., 1995), and so on. More recently, it has been
applied to genetic association analyses in high—throughput sequenc—
ing assays (Shim et al., 2015). In ribosome footprint profiles, there
may be noise in sequencing and alignment, as well as insufficient
sampling due to low sequencing depth. To extract reliable signals
for downstream analysis, we adopt wavelet decomposition to build
a multiresolution reconstruction of ribosome marginal densities.

Let p, denote the marginal density of ribosomes along a given
transcript t, such that 17, represents the probability that the A—site
of a randomly sampled ribosome is at position x (in units of codons).
We can decompose this function as

Pt(x) : Z “jo,kipjo,k(x)+z Z ﬂirt/019% (1)
’8 iZio k

where (pmﬁn(x) : 2m/2(p(2mx — n) and r/Imﬁn(x) : 2m/Zr//(2”‘x — n),
with (p(x) and r//(x) corresponding to a scaling function and its associ—
ated wavelet, respectively (Burrus et al., 1998). The coefficients or?”
and [fit-7,, are uniquely determined by inner products (pt(x),(pioﬁk(x))
and (174x), r/Iiﬁk(x)), respectively. The spans of rpm,” and l/lmﬁn form a
multiresolution approximation of L2(1R) as

{0}C---CV_1CVOCV1CV2C---CL2(1R),

Where Vm : W‘i‘l’mml‘nen Wm : W‘iwmnlwez and VMEBW :

solution reconstruction, in which global shapes are decoupled from
local patterns. In what follows, we use p? to denote the projection of
17, onto subspace S. Table 1 summarizes the reproducibility of

2.3 Kernel smoothing on sequence context

The marginal density at a given position may depend not only on
the codon at that position, but also on neighboring codons.
Furthermore, the extent of inﬂuence may decay as the physical dis—
tance from the position increases. We apply kernel smoothing
(Silverman, 1986; Wand and Jones, 1994) to capture these effects.
First, we represent each transcript as a collection of binary strings, a
well—used method for coding categorical variables in regression
(Hardy, 1993). Label the 64 codon types by C : {1. . . . .64}. Given
a transcript t with Z, codons, we define a length—Z, binary strings cit-
for each i E C, where the character at position x is defined as

[ ] { 1, if thexth codon oftranscript tis codon type/ 6 C.
c- x :

0. otherwise.

Note that, for each position x E {1. . . . 1,}, there is exactly one
codon type j E C such that C;-  : 1; all other strings will have a 0 at
pos1tlon x.

Next, we apply kernel smoothing to each string as

Z K(x. x’)clt- [x’]

— —2 WM) . (2)

where K(x.x’) is a suitably chosen kernel. Intuitively, if the ribo—
some marginal density is affected by sequence context, then a re—
gion with a cluster of slow translating codons is likely to become
congested with ribosomes. By smoothing C;- with a kernel, we in—
corporate the distribution of neighboring codons into our
model. Figure 3 illustrates the method we propose, in which
the black spikes represent the decomposed codon sequences
and the red curves are the kernel smoothed estimates with a sym—
metric Gaussizan kernel, k(x.x,-) : fN(x;x,-. a), where fN(x;p. a) :
er 2nexpiLzzﬁi'

Since the ﬂow of ribosomes is directional, a cluster of slow trans—

 

lating codons should have a larger impact on upstream ribosomes
than on downstream ribosomes. To take this directionality into ac—
count, we therefore employ an asymmetric kernel. An example of
asymmetric kernels is the probability density function of the gamma
distribution,
a—1 —x/b
kmmwz%ﬁﬁpxemmﬂ

where a and b are the shape and scale parameters, respectively, and
F(r) : ISO tr‘le‘tdt is the gamma function. It can be shown that the
peak of this density function is located at 0 : (a — 1)b, and the
standard deviation is a : bﬁ. We define a modified gamma distri—
bution fSRG, parameterized by 0 and a, by applying a horizontal shift

where a : 1 + W and b : %. The Gamma distribution fG
and the modified gamma distribution fSRG are illustrated in Figure 4.
We also define a shifted but non—reﬂected function fSG to take into

In what follows, we set the 0 parameter of fSG and fSRG to 5, because
a ribosome occupies 9—10 codons and there are about 5 codons

downstream. Applications of these asymmetric kernels fSRG and fSG
are depicted as blue and green curves in Figure 3 respectively.

2.4 Sparse regression model

We relate the ribosome marginal density to the transcript sequence
context by building a sparse model. In (2), we apply
K(x.x’):f5G(x—x’;0.ab).K(x.x’):f5RG(x—x’;0.ab) or K(x.x’) :
fN(x;x’,a;,) with B different bandwidths a1.....a3. For each codon
type j E C, let 6;” denote the codon feature string smoothed using
the kernel function f E {fN.f5G.f5RG} with bandwidth a. If we use Q
distinct kernel functions f1.. . . .fQ, then for each position x of tran—
script t, the predictors can be represented as

Zt(x) i: (6:1,f1(x)7 6:2,f1(x)7“ ' 76:3,f1(x)7“ ' 7

We relate these sequence features to the ribosome marginal density

sparse solution. The sparsity of the solution depends on the value of
the regularization parameter A. This type of linear estimation,
known as LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996; Zhao and Yu, 2006), avoids
overfitting the data especially in scenarios where the number of pre—
dictors is much larger than the number of observations. It also pro—
vides an interpretation of the importance of each predictor, i.e., the
variables that correspond to zeros in the solution 8 are not signifi—

ribosome marginal density.

3 Results

After the filtering step described in Section 2.1, we grouped genes
according to their length into 5 bins: £250 codons, 251—500 codons,
501—750 codons, 751—1000 codons and 21000 codons. We then
decomposed each ribosome footprint profile using wavelet analysis
with Daubechies—8 basis and eight scales, as illustrated in Figure 2.
We considered a model with both asymmetric kernels fSG and ngG
each with eight bandwidths (01,02, 03, a4, a5, 06, 07, as) :
(1. 3. 5. 12.5. 25. 37.5. 50. 75). For comparison, we also considered a
model with the symmetric kernel fN with the same set of band—
widths, as well as a model with no kernel smoothing. We trained the
regression model using 9n/ 10 randomly chosen genes, where n is the
number of genes in the corresponding bin, and chose the regulariza—
tion parameter in (3) via five—fold cross—validation using the training
data. Then the model was tested on the genes that were left out, and
the process was repeated until every gene has been tested.

Results of CHX—treated footprints in various spaces are summar—
ized in Table 2. The average performance is presented in terms of
the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and the
true ribosome marginal densities. Notice that our method using
asymmetric kernels achieved high accuracy in subspaces V0 through
V4. This suggests that the global shape of transcript—specific ribo—
some footprint profile is well captured by our proposed kernel—
smoothed codon sequences. The performance in the subspace Vk de—
creases as k increases. This is partly due to noise in the read align—
ment or the sequencing noise inherent in ribosome profiling. Thus,
wavelet analysis is useful for studying the limit of the ribosome
profiling technique and focusing on the reliable signals. The results
from using non—smoothed codon sequences were the least accurate,
supporting that the neighboring codons or interference play an im—
portant role in ribosome footprint distributions. Using asymmetric
kernel smoothing produced more accurate results than using a sym—
metric kernel. The same trend also holds for flash—freeze ribosome
profiles (Table 2). The performance of our method on CHX—treated

ribosome profiles was better than that on the ﬂash—freeze profiles.
This may be due to the large amplitude of ramps near the 5’ end in
CHX—treated profiles (Weinberg et al., 2016). These ramps contrib—
ute significantly to global shapes, and can be well captured by asym—
metric kernel smoothing.

In general, our method with asymmetric kernels was able to
predict the global shape of transcript—specific ribosome density
with high accuracy. However, for the ﬂash—freeze data, the corre—
lation in the subspace V0 was relatively poor for the genes shorter
than 250 codons. This is because the global shape of their profiles
in this subspace was rather flat for the ﬂash—freeze data. If the
mean squared error is used as the performance measure, the results
for shorter genes are not so much worse than that for longer genes.
As an example, Figure 5 shows the ribosome density of YBR212W
in various subspaces and the corresponding predictions for both
CHX—treated and ﬂash—freeze profiles. Figure 6 shows heatmaps
of the regression coefficients for transcripts of length 3250 codons
in the space V3. This result shows that CGA (arginine), CCG (pro—
line) and CGG (arginine) have a strong influence on the global
shape of ribosome occupancy in flash—freeze data, while CGA and
CGG seem to have the dominant effect in CHX—treated data. This
may be related to wobble base pairing, which has been found to be
associated with slow elongation (Lareau et al., 2014; Stadler and
Fire, 2011). In particular, high ribosome occupancy has been
observed on wobble—paired proline CCG (G—U base pairing) and
arginine CGA (I—A pairing) by Lareau et al. (2014). Furthermore,
CGA is one of the codons with the most prolonged elongation
rates, consistent with Lareau et al.

To examine further how the distribution of codons may affect
the shape of ribosome footprint profiles, we carried out a sliding—
window analysis for each transcript, using a window size of 20
codons. For each transcript, we first identified all windows for
which the average ribosome density was larger than twice the
transcript—wide average ribosome density, and then considered those
windows for codon enrichment analysis. For each selected window,
let a) : [w1.w2.....w64] denote the observed codon distribution,
where w,- is the number of codons of type i within the window. We
compared this observed codon distribution with the expected

are scaled such that the largest absolute value among them is set to 1 for display. These regression coefficients provide insight into the influence of each codon.
In particular, they show that codons CGA, CCG and CGG strongly influence the global shape of ribosome occupancy in flash-freeze data, while CGA and CGG

seem to have the dominant effect in CHX-treated data

distribution 11 = [111,112, . . . ,1164], where 11, denotes the expected num—
ber of codons of type i within the window, assuming sampling 20
codons without replacement according to the codon distribution in
the entire transcript. Note that 11 follows a multivariate hypergeomet—
ric distribution. We performed a paired t—test on w and 11 over the se—
lected windows and identified the codons enriched in high ribosome—
occupancy regions. We then compared the P—values from the enrich—
ment analysis with the frequencies of the regression coefficients being
nonzero, as illustrated in Figure 7. The scatter plot for ﬂash—freeze
data (Fig. 7B) shows that all of the significantly enriched codons were
selected frequently by the regression model. Codons that were se—
lected frequently but not significantly enriched in high density regions

might have been selected for prediction in low ribosomal density re—
gions. For example, it has been observed previously (Lareau et al. ,
2014) that GGG and GTT are some of the codons with the least foot—
print abundance. For the CHX—treated data, there were a few codons
enriched significantly but not selected frequently (Fig. 7A); this could
be due to technical biases in the data, discussed in Section 4.

4 Discussion

Our results on S. cerevisiae data, especially the CHX—treated foot—
prints, show that the global shape of transcript—specific ribosome

density can be predicted with high accuracy. This suggests that the
ribosome distribution along a transcript indeed depends on the se—
quence context. In particular, we find a few codons that dominate
the global shape; these codons inﬂuence the ribosome density not
only at the site where they appear, but also their neighboring
positions.

There are several possible reasons why applying kernel smooth—
ing to codon sequences helps in predicting the shape of transcript—
specific ribosome occupancy profile. One possible reason is the
interference among ribosomes. Another possible explanation is that
the physical footprint of each ribosome spans multiple codons (9—10
codons). Lastly, it has been shown (Charneski and Hurst, 2013) that
positively charged amino acids on nascent peptides significantly
slow down ribosomes downstream from where the residues are
encoded. Among all the methods compared, the asymmetric kernel
smoothing performed the best. This could be due to the directional
movement of ribosomes and the aforementioned effect of positively
charged amino acids on downstream elongation speeds. Also, 5’
ramps can be better predicted using asymmetric kernels, which
partly explains why the prediction accuracy for CHX—treated ribo—
some profiles was slightly better than that for ﬂash—freeze profiles.

There are other factors not incorporated into our current model
that could also help to explain ribosome distributions, e.g. mRNA
secondary structure. Notice that in the results for CHX—treated ribo—
some footprints, we achieved better performance in shorter genes.
When applying a sliding window to genes with a prediction correl—
ation coefficient below 0.3 and of length 1001—1500 codons, we
observed that the correlation was lower near the 5’ end.
Furthermore, when computing differences between the observed
ribosome densities and the predicted densities from these poorly pre—
dicted genes, we noticed a weak positive correlation (r : 0.0446) be—
tween the differences and the likelihood of double stranded
conformations, i.e., the PARS (parallel analysis of RNA structure)
scores of secondary structure defined by Kertesz et al. (2010) in a

genome—wide measurement. Although many potential factors—
including mRNA secondary structure, codon usage bias, tRNA—
adaption index, etc.—are not explicitly incorporated into our
model, most of these factors depend on the sequence context. This
may be one of the reasons why considering transcript sequences
alone enables reasonably accurate prediction of ribosome footprint
profile shapes.

It is possible that some of the features learned by our predictive
model are due to technical biases in the data. Library construction is a
possible source of bias due to technical artifacts. Artieri and Fraser
(2014) found three types of nucleotide biases by comparing mRNA
fragments (unprotected by ribosomes) with ribosome footprints to
identify shared biases. These include an enrichment of adenine at the
5’ and 3’ ends, and a depletion of cytosine at the fourth nucleotide pos—
ition in both the mRNA and ribosome footprint reads. However, we
note that the ﬂash—freeze ribosome footprint data (Weinberg et al.,
2016) we analyzed were generated using a comprehensive set of
adapter sequences to avoid the biases discussed in Artieri and Fraser
(2014). Furthermore, the ﬂash—freeze protocol avoids the ribosome
run—off phenomenon that can occur in CHX pre—treatment.

Different models have been proposed in the literature to estimate
elongation rates. Shah et al. (2013) developed a continuous—time,
discrete—state Markov model to simulate translational dynamics, in
which initiation and elongation rates were inferred using the cell
volume, ribosome abundance and tRNA abundance. These elong—
ation rates were codon dependent but not position dependent. The
model proposed by Pop et al. (2014) was based on ﬂow conserva—
tion, and it assumed that the occurrences of the same codon within
an mRNA transcript have the same dwell time, and hence the same
elongation rate. Our results suggest that these models should take
the codon position into account. In other words, the elongation rate
at a particular position along a transcript not only depends on the
codon at that position but also the neighboring codons and how the
neighboring codons are ordered.

Part of the results presented in this paper is based on combining
four publicly available datasets. This overcomes the difficulty of sparse
sampling that other work may encounter, e.g. Pop et al. (2014).
Although our study is limited to the steady—state distribution of ribo—
somes, it examines the extent to which the sequence context inﬂuences
ribosome distributions under normal conditions. One of the important
applications of our method is to examine the positions where the
steady—state prediction is significantly different from the actual meas—
urements. These positions may lead to important findings of unknown
factors that regulate translation. For example, our proposed method
can be applied to cells grown under various environmental conditions,
or to ribosome profiles obtained by different inhibitors, e.g. harringto—
nine (Ingolia et al., 2011), anisomycin (Lareau et al., 2014).

Another application is the inference of isoform—specific ribosome
footprints. It is known that many human genes have more than one
isoform, and these isoforms contribute to the complexity of pheno—
types (Johnson et al., 2003; Lander et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2008).
Studying the translation of specific isoforms requires correctly as—
signing ribosome footprints to them. However, since the footprints
of ribosomes are short (28—30 nucleotides), identifying the correct
isoform becomes challenging. Our method provides a likelihood
function for ribosome location, and can facilitate sequence align—
ment when more than one alignment exists. Synthetic biology is an—
other active research area (Endy, 2005) that can benefit from our
work: the ability to predict and compare the ribosome densities
along different transcripts under various environmental conditions
can facilitate the search for sequences with optimal translational
properties and reduce the number of experimental trials necessary to
build and test the sequences.

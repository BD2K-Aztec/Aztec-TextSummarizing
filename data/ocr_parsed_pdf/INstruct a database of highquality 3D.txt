INstruct: a database of structurally resolved protein interactome networks

 

the domain—level interactions and (iii) sortable tables providing
information about domain4iomain interactions. The sidebar
always contains the search box, for refinement of search terms,
and a dialog for downloading the complete set of interactions
that match all terms in the query.

For each protein that interacts with a query protein, a sche—
matic is shown, displaying the domain architecture of both pro—
teins side—by—side as linear models according the order of their
amino acids (an example is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1).
Between each pair of proteins, domains that interact are indi—
cated in green and those that do not are indicated in gray.
Network edges are drawn between domains that interact on
the two proteins, with edges colored in red indicating domain
interactions derived directly from co—crystal evidence, and edges
in gray indicating domain4iomain interactions inferred by hom—
ology. Regardless of whether a domain is involved in a structur—
ally resolved interaction, all domain information is interactive
and linked to further information provided on the Pfam website.

Interactions involving the queried protein and each of its inter—
acting partners are shown in a table below each schematic and
can be sorted by domain on either protein, on the number of
publications supporting this interaction, or on the number of
supporting PDB structures. PDB structures that provide direct
co—crystal evidence for the indicated domainidomain interaction
are shown in red, and all other PDB structures provide hom—
ology—based evidence and are shown in blue. External references,
including Pfam links to each domain in the interacting pair, pub—
lication information from PubMed, and PDB structures support—
ing each interaction, can be accessed by clicking on their
corresponding entry in the table.

Additionally, each search produces a tab—delimited text file
containing all relevant information about the interactions as
shown on the results page, including all available naming con—
ventions and amino acid locations of the interacting domains. A
custom dataset can be created simply by searching for up to
ﬁve proteins at once, separating each term with a delimiter in
the search ﬁeld, or by uploading a ﬁle of identifiers on the
downloads page. All valid search terms will be added to the
downloadable file and displayed on the results page.

When available, the domain4iomain interaction pairs that fa—
cilitate the shown protein interactions on the results page will
appear in the sidebar on the right side of the results page.
Underneath each domain4iomain pair is given a list of proteins
that interact via the same domain4iomain pair. Proteins in red
provide the direct co—crystal evidence for the given domaini
domain interaction. In other words, a co—crystal containing
each protein in red proves the existence of the domainidomain
interaction in the ﬁrst place and allows us to resolve other pro—
teiniprotein interactions to include this domainidomain
interaction.

4 CONCLUSON

INstruct will be a useful tool in a broad spectrum of fundamental
biological research. With the continued growth of data sources,
especially available co—crystal structures in the PDB, we expect

the coverage of our structurally resolved interactome networks to
increase over time (Chandonia and Brenner, 2006). We plan to
update INstruct at least once per year to incorporate newly avail—
able information and to expand our repertoire of model organ—
isms. As more structural data become available, we will build
more comprehensive 3D, structurally resolved interactome net—
works for different organisms.

Abstract

Summary: Continuous—time Markov chain models with finite state space are routinely used for ana—
lysis of discrete character data on phylogenetic trees. Examples of such discrete character data in—
clude restriction sites, gene family presence/absence, intron presence/absence and gene family
size data. While models with constrained substitution rate matrices have been used to good effect,
more biologically realistic models have been increasingly implemented in the recent literature
combining, e.g., site rate variation, site partitioning, branch—specific rates, allowing for non—
stationary prior root probabilities, correcting for sampling bias, etc. to name a few. Here, a flexible
and fast R package is introduced that infers evolutionary rates of discrete characters on a tree
within a probabilistic framework. The package, markophylo, fits maximum—likelihood models
using Markov chains on phylogenetic trees. The package is efficient, with the workhorse functions
written in C++ and the interface in user—friendly R.

Availability and implementation: markophylo is available as a platform—independent R package
from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at https://cran.r—project.org/web/packages/marko

 

phylo/. A vignette with numerous examples is also provided with the R package.

1 Introduction

A Markov chain framework is frequently adopted to estimate evolu-
tionary rates of discrete characters on phylogenetic trees. Some ex-
amples of previously investigated data using such models include
restriction sites (Felsenstein, 1992), gene family size data (Hahn et
(11., 2005), gene family presence/absence patterns (Hao and Golding,
2006), intron presence/absence data (Kim and Hao, 2014), etc. A
good introduction to such models can be found in O’Meara (2012)
and Yang (2014). It has been noted before that many variants of
such models are just restrictions of more general models for investi-
gation of specific hypotheses or different kinds of data (O’Meara,
2012). Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient soft-
ware to provide a unified interface that would allow fitting of varied
discrete character datasets.

Recently, Kim and Hao (2014) put forward a unified R (R Core
Team, 2015) package, namely DiscML, that provided users the

option of biologically realistic features like gamma rate variation
(Yang, 1994), estimation of character prior root probabilities
(Cohen et (11., 2008), correcting for ancient characters being lost
from all examined extant taxa (cf. Felsenstein, 1992), etc. As noted
in Kim and Hao (2014), while many of these features are found in
existing programs like BayesTraits (Pagel et (11., 2004), CAFE3
(Han et 111., 2013), BadiRate (Librado et (11., 2012) and GLOOME
(Cohen et (11., 2010), the sum total of these above-mentioned desir-
able features was not available in a single flexible software.
However, DiscML is not computationally inexpensive. Moreover,
DiscML does not currently allow for partition analyses or for ac-
counting for sampling bias arising due to multiple unobserved phy-
letic patterns (see Supplementary Material).

Here, we present markophylo, an R package that is both fast
and flexible. The markophylo package allows for estimating evolu-
tionary rates using a user-specified, i.e. hypothesis driven,

substitution rate matrix in a continuous—time Markov chain model
on phylogenies. The package is computationally efficient, with the
workhorse functions written in C++, using the chp (Eddelbuettel
et al., 2011) and chpArmadillo (Eddelbuettel and Sanderson,
2014) packages. The package is flexible, capable of modelling a
myriad array of processes (described below in Section 2.2).

2 Description

2.1 Input

A phylogenetic tree with branch lengths in units of expected substi—
tutions per site and a matrix containing phyletic patterns of discrete
characters are the primary external inputs needed for markophylo.
The tree must be in the phylo format of the APE package (Paradis
et al., 2004), while each row of the matrix represents a phyletic pat—
tern, where the columns denote closely related taxa of interest.

2.2 Features
The following features are available in the primary function
markophylo: :estimaterates:

1. Custom substitution rate matrices can be easily speciﬁed. These
can be as simple as matrices where each non—diagonal entry is
hypothesized to be the same (discrete character analogue of
Jukes and Cantor, 1969), or birth—death matrices, or symmetric
matrices (where the instantaneous rate of change from character
1' to j is the same as character / to i), to matrices where each non—
diagonal entry is different.

2. A custom character—only or numeric—only alphabet for the dis—
crete characters can be speciﬁed with no limit on the number of
possible states.

3. Clades or groups of branches hypothesized to follow substitu—
tion rates different from other branches can be easily speciﬁed.
This is often essential when a clade is very diverged from other
branches based on evolutionary time.

4. Sites can also be split into different partitions, where each parti—
tion of sites is a group of sites following their own rates different
from the sites in the other partitions. This is useful, e.g. when
different rates are hypothesized for mitochondrial versus nuclear
genes (O’Meara, 2012).

5. Gamma rate variation (Yang, 1994) can be speciﬁed: a common
gamma distribution (with or : I}, where or and I} are the shape
and rate parameters, respectively) over all partitions or separate
gamma rates within each partition separately. The latter option
is useful when the hypothesized evolutionary processes among
the different partitions are different enough to warrant separate
gamma distributions for each partition.

6. Prior root probabilities for each discrete character can be either
user—speciﬁed (based on some known constraint at the root),
equal for each character state, follow Markov chain stationary
probabilities or be estimated in the maximum likelihood frame—
work when it is not reasonable to assume stationarity.

7. Correcting for multiple unobservable phyletic patterns, i.e. sam—
pling (aka acquisition or ascertainment) bias. It is often import—
ant to correct for sampling bias. If sampling bias exists during
data collection, some phyletic patterns cannot be observed in the
data and as a result, not correcting for this in the statistical
model can lead to biased estimates. Such a correction has been
applied previously. For example, this correction has been used in
the analysis of restriction sites (Felsenstein, 1992), when only
variable characters are recorded (Lewis, 2001), correcting for
unobservable ancient genes that are lost and not observed at the

tips (Hao and Golding, 2006) or because gene families appearing
in the COG database cannot occur in less than three genomes
(Cohen and Pupko, 2010). DiscML only provides the option of
correcting for observations of a zero character for each taxa;
however, multiple user—speciﬁed phyletic patterns can be easily
corrected for in markophylo.

The package also contains five example (simulated) datasets
and a vignette that contains numerous examples. These data illus—
trate the kinds of models that the package is capable of fitting to dis—
crete character data recorded for multiple taxa (with a user

phylogeny).

2.3 Output

The output from the primary function contains parameter estimates
for the user—specified substitution rate matrix, standard errors, time
taken, a reduced dataset containing unique patterns and their fre—
quencies and model selection criteria values, namely the Akaike in—
formation criterion (Akaike, 1973) and the Bayesian information
criterion (Schwarz, 1978).

3 Discussion

Here, a flexible and efficient R package named markophylo for esti—
mating evolutionary rates of discrete characters is introduced. When
compared with existing packages like DiscML, markophylo is at
least an order of magnitude faster. Moreover, markophylo imple—
ments a wide variety of features increasingly seen in more biologically
realistic Markov chain models run on discrete character datasets.

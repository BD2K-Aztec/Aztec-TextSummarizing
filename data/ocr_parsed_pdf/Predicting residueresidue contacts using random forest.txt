ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein residue—residue contact prediction can be useful
in predicting protein 3D structures. Current algorithms for such a
purpose leave room for improvement.

Results: We develop ProC_SS, a set of Random Forest algorithm-
based models, for predicting residue—residue contact maps. The
models are constructed based on a collection of 1490 non—
redundant, high-resolution protein structures using >1280 sequence-
based features. A new amino acid residue contact propensity matrix
and a new set of seven amino acid groups based on contact
preference are developed and used in ProC_SS. ProC_S3 delivers
a 3-fold cross-validated accuracy of 26.9% with coverage of 4.7%
for top L/5 predictions (L is the number of residues in a protein) of
long-range contacts (sequence separation 3 24). Further benchmark
tests deliver an accuracy of 29.7% and coverage of 5.6% for
an independent set of 329 proteins. In the recently completed
Ninth Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of
Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP9), ProC_S3 is
ranked as No. 1, No. 3, and No. 2 accuracies in the top L/5, U10
and best 5 predictions of long-range contacts, respectively, among
18 automatic prediction servers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Knowing pair-wise protein residue—residue (RR) contacts can be
helpful in predicting 3D protein structures, because the contact
information can be used to reduce the conformational phase space,
while improving the minimum of the landscape ﬁinnel of the overall
energy function (Wu and Zhang, 2008; Zhang, 2009). In addition, the
contacts have been used to construct a scoring function for protein
model selection (Randall and Baldi, 2008).

Currently, there are two kinds of approaches for RR contact
predictions: template-based threading and sequence-based machine
learning approaches. Although template-based approaches can be
more accurate than sequence-based ones if proper templates are
available, they are less useful in ab initio structure predictions for
proteins not having known-structure homologs as templates (Wu and
Zhang, 2008). In this work, we focus on developing sequence-based
algorithms for RR contact predictions.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Numerous sequence-based methods have been developed using
machine learning algorithms such as artiﬁcial neural networks
(ANNs) (Fariselli and Casadio, 1999; Fariselli et (11., 2001; Pollastri
et (11., 2001; Punta and Rost, 2005; Tegge et (11., 2009; Vullo
et (11., 2006; Xue et (11., 2009; Zhang and Huang, 2004), support
vector machines (SVMs) (Cheng and Baldi, 2007; Wu and Zhang,
2008; Zhao and Karypis, 2005), Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
(Bjorkholm et (11., 2009; Shao and Bystroff, 2003), Genetic
Algorithm (GA) (Chen and Li, 2010; MacCallum, 2004), etc. The
mean accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art RR predictors is often
in the range of 20—30%, suggesting that it remains in need of
improvement. Nevertheless, some of these methods have already
been put into practical use. For example, recently Zhang et (11. (2003)
achieved signiﬁcant performance improvement of their I-TASSER
server by adding a sequence-based contact prediction module based
on SVMSEQ (Wu et (11., 2011). As results, the average TM-score of
the I-TASSER models on the hard targets of the Ninth Community
Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for
Protein Structure Prediction (CASP9) was improved by as much
as 4.6%. In several cases, the TM-scores of I-TASSER models were
improved by >30%, essentially converting ‘non-foldable’ targets to
‘foldable’ ones.

A general procedure of developing sequence-based RR contact
predictors includes several steps: (i) constructing a non-redundant
and comprehensive protein structure set; (ii) calculating protein and
residue properties that may be relevant to contact; (iii) training a
model based on a machine learning algorithm and (iv) evaluating
the performance of the predictive model. Therefore, improvement
can be achieved in one or any combinations of the ﬁrst three steps:
a better representative dataset, properties more relevant to the RR
contacts and a more robust machine learning algorithm. In this work,
we attempt to improve prediction accuracy in all three steps.

We develop statistical models for predicting RR contact maps
based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm (Breiman, 2001). The
training dataset consists of 1490 non-redundant protein structures.
We use a set of 1287 sequence-based features that can be roughly
grouped into four categories: local window features, residue pair
features, separation segment features and whole protein information.
In addition to features commonly used in these types of models, we
introduce a new contact propensity matrix based on a large-scale
statistical analysis. We also develop a new set of seven amino acid
groups using a clustering technique.

To the best of our knowledge, ProC_S3 is the ﬁrst RR predictor
based on the RF algorithm (Breiman, 2001). RF is an ensemble
approach that combines many classiﬁers to achieve a robust
classiﬁer. RF has been applied in broad classiﬁcation tasks and has
demonstrated good performance (Fang et (11., 2008; Sikic et (11.,
2009; Wang et (11., 2009). It is particularly suitable in classifying

high-dimensional and noisy data. One of its advantageous features
is that it can handle a mixture of categorical and continuous
predictors. In addition, RF models do not require a time-consuming
optimization process and make predictions considerably faster than
many other algorithms such as SVM.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

We use several datasets in this study to build and test the predictive models.
The ﬁrst dataset D1490 was selected from all X-ray determined protein 3D
structures in PDB database (downloaded in January 2009). The data selection
criteria were as follows: resolution 5 2.0 A. R-factor <025 and number of
residues ranging between 50 and 400. Membrane proteins [determined by
SCOP (Murzin at 611., 1995)] and broken chains. deﬁned as the distance
between the two C01 atoms in residues that occur next to one another in the
PDB ﬁles >42 A. were excluded (Chen and Brooks. 2007; Li and Zhang.
2009). Sequence redundancy was reduced by BLASTClust (Altschul at 611.,
1990) with the threshold set to 25% identity. Finally. a total of 1490 protein
chains were acquired. including 460 851 contact pairs and 19 511 597 non-
contact pairs (positive cases: ~2.3%).

We also collected a set of protein structures released during January
200971anuary 2010. The structures were then ﬁltered using the same criteria
as described above. There are 329 structures in the dataset (D329) with
sequence identity 25% or less to each other in the dataset as well as to
any sequence in D1490. D329 is used as an independent dataset for testing
purposes.

We evaluate the predictive models on the 121 CASP8 target proteins. Since
many of these proteins are homologous to those in the training dataset. we
identify 16 proteins with no >25% identity to D1490.

2.2 Deﬁnition of RR contact

A residue pair is deﬁned as contact (positive) or non-contact (negative)
according to whether their Cﬁ atoms (C01 for glycine) are within a distance

Table 1. Contact propensity matrix

of 8 A. or not. All contacts are grouped into short-. medium- and long-range
categories by sequence separation using the three separation ranges: 6711.
12723 and Z 24. Such criteria have been used in CASP7 to CASP9 and have
been adopted by most of recent predictors.

2.3 A novel contact propensity matrix

It is well-known that the contact propensity between different pairs of
amino acid residues may vary signiﬁcantly. Consequently. several contact
preference matrixes have been developed. including Levitt” 5 contact potential
(Hinds and Levitt. 1992). Jernigan’s pair wise potential (Miyazawa and
Jernigan. 1996) and Braun’s pair wise potential (Zhu and Braun. 1999).
With the rapid growth of protein structures in public databases. we feel it
is necessary to develop a new matrix since all three of these matrices were
developed using limited numbers of protein structures. In addition. all three
existing methods do not consider the relative positions of the residues.

The new matrix was obtained from statistical analyses of a set
of 585 non-redundant high-resolution protein structures (5 2.0 A). a
subset of the structures in a training dataset collected by Punta
and Rost (2005) without structures having broken sequences. We
ﬁrst calculate the percentages of contacts of all 20*20 pairs using
the formlﬂa 0f (Neon(ivj)/(Ncon(ivj)+Nnon-con(ivj))» Where NeonUvj) and
Nnomconﬁ, j) are the number of contacted and non-contacted residue
pairs of i and j. deﬁned in the previous section. The numbers
are then normalized to the proportion of the largest one (in bold)
(Table 1).

2.4 The seven amino acid groups

We use a hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster residues according to
their contact preference (Fig. 1). Based on the clustering results. we divide
the 20 amino acids into seven groups: weak hydrophobic residues (Ala and
Met). hydrophobic residues (Val. Ile and Leu). aromatic residues (Phe. Tyr
and Trp). positively charged residues (Arg and Lys). negatively charged
residues (Asp and Glu). cysteine and all other residues (Gly. Ser. Asn. His.

Cells show the normalized proportions of contacted residue pairs. A residue pair is deﬁned as contact (positive) or non-contact (negative) according to whether their C13 atoms
(Ca for glycine) are within a distance of 8 A or not. The data are obtained from statistical analysis of 585 non-redundant high-resolution protein structures.

Fig. 1. Hierarchical clustering of 20 amino acids according to their contact
preference. Hierarchical Clustering Explorer (HCE. version 3.5) is used to
perform the clustering. Euclidean distance. column-to-column normalization
by median and average linkage are used to set up the clustering. The bottom
bars represent the seven groups used in the work.

Pro. Thr and Gln). Therefore. this classiﬁcation is largely consistent to the
physicochemical properties of the amino acids.

2.5 Feature construction

We assemble a set of 1282 features for short and medium RR contact
predictions. and 1287 features for long-range RR contact predictions. These
features can be roughly grouped into four categories:

2.6 Local window features (810 + 4)

Local window features are created using a 15-residue sliding window
centered at each residue in a residue pair. The bulk of the features in this
category are generated from the position-speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM) of
the sequence. determined using PSIBLAST (Altschul at 611.. 1990) against
a non-redundant sequence database. which are ﬁltered by 90% sequence
identity threshold (NR90). For each residue in the local window pair.
we use 22 numeric features extracted from PSSM including the log-odds
frequency of 20 types of residues. the gap and the residue information score
of each position. Other features include three mutually exclusive binary
coding features (helix: 100. sheet: 010. coil: 001). four secondary structure
predicted by PSIPRED (McGufﬁn at 611.. 2000) and two binary coding
features (exposed: 10. buried: 01. using 25% relative accessible area as
threshold) for solvent accessibility predicted by SSpro (Cheng at 611.. 2005).
Overall. there are 810 (2 X 15 X 27) features for each residue pair.

We also use the averages of maximum accessible surface areas (Frank
Eisenhaber. 1993) and the isoelectric points of the amino acids in two local
windows (four features).

2.7 Residue pair features (49 + 4 + 4 + 4)

The ﬁrst set of residue pair features are constructed using the seven amino
acid groups described in the previous section. The combination of the
categories of residue 1 and j produce 49 (7 X 7) binary coding features with
only one element matching the type assigned to 1 and all others to 0.

Correlated mutation information of two residues under consideration
is encoded in four features. The joint entropy and mutual information
of residues 1 and j are estimated from PSSM using Zpkllogpk) and
ZpkllogQJH/(pkpm. where pk and p) are the probability of residue type
k and 1 appear in position i andj. In addition. the cosine (2101/1/sz Zyz)
and correlation (XXX —3r)(y —§/)/ 20: —3r)2 :0; —§/)2) of the two positions
are calculated (Cheng and Baldi. 2007).

Four position-independent contact preference features represented by a
20*20 matrix are also used. including Levitt’s contact potential (Hinds and
Levitt. 1992). J ernigan’s pair wise potential (Miyazawa and J ernigan. 1996).
Braun’s pair wise potential (Zhu and Braun. 1999) and the one introduced
in this work as described in the previous section.

In addition. the maximum accessible surface area and the isoelectric point
of the amino acids for residue 1 and j are considered.

2.8 Separation segment features
(6/11 + 20 + 343 + 12 + 2)

The lengths of the separation segments are split into six bins for short (6.
7. 8. 9. 10. 11) and medium contacts (12713. 14715. 16717. 18719. 20721.
22723). and 11 bins for long range contacts (24728. 29732. 33736. 3741-0.
4144. 45418. 49752. 53757. 58762. 63$7. z 68).

For a residue pair 1 and j. the distribution of secondary structure and
solvent accessibility for the residues in the segment between i and j is
recorded by the four-order of weighted mean. which is deﬁned as

f n
F.(K>=Z<m  anxKyv—i) (1)

—l
‘—l
m:i ‘]

 

where n is equal to 0. 1. 2 and 3; K is one of the three secondary structure
classes (helix. strand or coil) or the two solvent accessibility classes (exposed
or buried). 8,,,(K) is a sigma function which equals to 1 when residue m is
in K class and 0 when not. A total of 20 (4 X 5) features are obtained in this
group.

In addition. we use 343 (7 X 7 X 7) features to record the occurrence of
all types of tripeptides in the separation segment. using the seven groups as
described above.

Twelve features of the central residue in the separation segment are
also generated. including the secondary structure (three features). solvent
accessibility (two features) and residue category (seven features).

The maximum accessible surface area and the isoelectric point of the
amino acids in the separation segment are the remaining two features in this

group.

2.9 Whole protein information (4+ 20)

Whole protein information includes lengths classiﬁed in four bins (550.
517100. 1017150 and >150) and the composition of 20 types of residues.

2.10 Random Forest

We use the R implementation of the RF algorithm V4.5 in the study (Liaw and
Wiener. 2002). The training and ﬁnal predictive models include 500 decision
trees. We also test models with 1000 trees. but no signiﬁcant improvement is
observed. We use the proportion of the positive decisions of these 500 trees
as the predicted probability score of a pair of residues.

2.11 Cross-validation and the ﬁnal models

We randomly split all proteins in D1490 into three portions and use a standard
3-fold cross-validation to estimate the performance of the models. We divide
residue pairs to short-. medium- and long-range groups. which correspond
to the sequence separations equal to 6-11. 12-23. and 324. respectively.
Each sample has a vector of 1282 (for short- and medium-range) or 1287
(for long-range) features and a label (contact or non-contact) based on the
structure of the protein.

Since there are many more negative samples than positive ones. we use all
positive samples and randomly select the same or double number of negative
samples in the training set to balance the data. However. all negative samples
are used in testing. After the cross-validation. we build the ﬁnal models

2.12 Performance assessment

We use the accuracy (Acc) and the coverage (Cov) to evaluate the top U5
and L predicted positives (contact residues) ranked by probability scores of

the predictors. where L is the total number of residues in the target proteins.
the Acc is deﬁned as the number of correctly predicted residue pairs divided
by the total number of predictions. and the Cov is the number of correctly
predicted residue pairs divided by the total number of existing contact residue
pairs of a given protein in the corresponding range. We also provide Xa’ used
by the assessors for the performance assessment in CASP9 (Monastyrskyy
at 611.. 2011). Xa’ is deﬁned as:

15 Ppi —Pai

Xd = —. (2)
Here Pp, and Pa, are the percentages of predicted contact pairs with a
distance of [4(1 — 1). 4i] and the percentage of all contact pairs with a distance
of [4(1—1). 4i]. Xd is a weighted harmonic average difference between
the distance distribution of the predicted contacts and the all-pairs distance
distribution; it also measures how the distribution of distances for predicted
positives differs from the distribution of all pairs of residues in the target

domains (Ezkurdia at 611.. 2009; Grana at 611., 2005).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Cross-validation on dataset D1490

In the 3-fold cross-validation, we test two different ways to construct
training datasets. In the ﬁrst approach, we randomly select equal
number of negative samples as the positives, while in the other
approach double the number of negative samples are used. We
calculate the accuracies and the coverage of both approaches
(Table 2). It can be seen that the latter model achieves modestly better
prediction performance and the improvement of the model using
more negative samples is more pronounced for long-range, rather
than short-range contact predictions. However, attempting to use
more negative samples (5: 1) does not result in further improvement
(data not shown). Therefore, in the ﬁnal model we use all contact
pairs from D1490 and randomly select double the number of
negative samples to construct the ﬁnal models of PROC_S3. These
models are then used to make predictions for ﬁirther assessments
and in the production server.

3.2 Benchmark tests on dataset D329

The results of the models on D329 proteins are summarized
in Table 3. The performance of the models on this dataset is
largely consistent to the results in cross-validation, conﬁrming
cross-validation is a suitable method for evaluating performance.
The accuracy of the top L/5 long-range predictions is close to
30%, suggesting the models have reached the level for practical
applications (Wu et (11., 2011; Zhang et (11., 2003). We analyze the
distribution of the true predictions for the top L and U5 predictions
(Table 4). Overall, more true predictions are associated with shorter

separations. The accuracy of predictions in shorter separations is
usually higher than that in longer separations. We also manually
check the predictions and ﬁnd that most of the true predictions
often form a few clusters. Such a trend was also observed in other
predictors (Cheng et (11., 2005). Interestingly, a signiﬁcant number
of false positives are close to the true contacts. We analyze the
predictions of a typical protein 3FWZA to illustrate the overall trend
in Supplementary Figure S1.

3.3 Benchmark tests on CASP8 targets

The benchmark test on the 121 CASP8 targets and a subset of 16
proteins distinct from training proteins are analyzed and summarized
in Table 5. The accuracies of the top L/5 of long-range predictions
are above the level of 30%.

Protein RR contact prediction

 

and TBM/FM (Template-based modeling/free modeling). Only
long-range RR contacts (i.e. separation 3 24) are considered. Among
25 groups submitted predictions for the evaluated domains, 18 are
classiﬁed as automatic servers and the remaining 7 are human
experts. Since human predictors had extra time and were allowed
to have expert manual intervention, they are excluded from the
following comparison. Table 6 provides the performance of these
18 servers in top L/5 predictions using accuracy, coverage and Xd
as performance metrics. PROC_S3 is ranked as No. 1 in accuracy
and Xd, and No. 3 in coverage. Similar results are also found in top
L/ 10 and best ﬁve predictions (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Since the ofﬁcial assessment focuses primarily on domains rather
than proteins, not all groups submitted a sufﬁcient number of
predictions for all domains. Therefore, the performance represented
by average accuracy, coverage and Xd is not strictly comparable
across different groups. A head-to-head comparison between groups
may represent a better choice. We calculate the ratios of win/lose,
deﬁned as the fraction of common targets for which the group
designated with the row label out- or under-performed the other

designated with the column label according to the accuracy of the U5
predictions, between seven top CASP9 servers including ProC_S3
and its previous version ProC_Sl (Table 7). In this comparison,
ProC_S3 is still ranked as one of the top servers, only second to
MULTICOM-CLUSTER (win/lose=0.818). It is noteworthy that
MULTICOM-CLUSTER is inferior to ProC_S 1, a replaced version
of ProC_S3 in this comparison (win/lose = 0.61), which in turn
performs worse than ProC_S3 (win/lose 0.6). Therefore, the
head-to-head comparison has its drawback.

3.5 Improvement from previous models

Two of our RF-based servers, namely ProC_Sl and ProC_S3,
participated in CASP9. The ProC_Sl server participated (named
RR_Fang_1) in CASP8 and was ranked as one of the top servers.
Tables 6—7 and Supplementary S1—S2 clearly show that there is
consistent improvement between these two versions. The accuracies
improved by 5.9—12.5% and the win/lose ratio of ProC_S3 versus
ProC_Sl is 1.67. ProC_S3 is a newer version with a number of
updates over ProC_Sl. First, we create a bigger training dataset
with 1490 non-redundant protein structures, which is much bigger
than the one with 585 proteins used to develop ProC_Sl. Second,
we adopt a number of new features including: (i) the average of
maximum accessible surface areas and isoelectric points of the
amino acids in two local windows (four features); (ii) f-mean of
the between segment (20 features) and (iii) features of the central
residue of the segment (seven features).

3.6 Advantages of RF

In the early stage of the project, we tested the SVM and RF
algorithms. We eventually abandoned SVM after we found that
the performance of optimized models using either algorithm was
very similar, but it took much more time to train a large SVM
model than a RF model based on the same training dataset. It is
absolutely necessary to optimize a few parameters for a SVM model
while using the default values of the RF parameters often result in
near-optimal performance. Moreover, the predicting time for a RF
model is signiﬁcantly shorter than a corresponding SVM model.
For example, in a comparative test of a SVM model using the RBF
kernel and a RF model with 1000 trees, it took the RF model just 81
s to complete the prediction of long-range contacts of a protein with
150 amino acid residues while the SVM model took 1299 s in the
same computer. In addition, the importance available in RF provides
a convenient and often good approach to feature selection.

4 CONCLUSION

In this work, we develop ProC_S3, a RR contact map predictor
based on the RF algorithm. Cross-validation and independent tests
demonstrate that the new predictor achieves consistent improvement
over its replaced version ProC_Sl. In addition, ProC_S3 is ranked
as one of the top automatic RR prediction servers participated in
CASP9.

Work is progressing on using feature selection to ﬁnd
features important to protein RR contacts. Preliminary results are
encouraging. A model using top 600 features, ranked by the mean
decrease in accuracy measure of RF, achieved an accuracy of 29.9%
for top L/5 predictions on D329, a slight improvement to the 29.7%
accuracy of the model using all features (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Although the improvement is minimal, it proves that it is feasible to
use feature selection to identify features important to protein residue
contacts. More important, it may help in better understanding the
biophysics behind the problem. Currently, we are evaluating several
other feature selection approaches. New models will be participating
in the upcoming CASP10 experiment in 2012.

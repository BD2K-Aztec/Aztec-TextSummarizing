ABSTRACT

Motivation: Clustering is commonly used to identify the best decoy
among many generated in protein structure prediction when using
energy alone is insufficient. Calculation of the pairwise distance
matrix for a large decoy set is computationally expensive. Typically,
only a reduced set of decoys using energy filtering is subjected to
clustering analysis. A fast clustering method for a large decoy set
would be beneficial to protein structure prediction and this still poses
a challenge.

Results: We propose a method using propagation of geometric
constraints to accelerate exact clustering, without compromising
the distance measure. Our method can be used with any metric
distance. Metrics that are expensive to compute and have known
cheap lower and upper bounds will benefit most from the method.
We compared our methods accuracy against published results from
the SPICKER clustering software on 40 large decoy sets from the
l-TASSER protein folding engine. We also performed some additional
speed comparisons on six targets from the ‘semfold’ decoy set. In
our tests, our method chose a better decoy than the energy criterion
in 25 out of 40 cases versus 20 for SPICKER. Our method also was
shown to be consistently faster than another fast software performing
exact clustering named Calibur. In some cases, our approach can
even outperform the speed of an approximate method.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein structure prediction from amino acid sequence generally
involves the search for the lowest energy conformation. This is based
on Anﬁnsen’s hypothesis that the native state of a protein is at the
global minimum in free energy (Anﬁnsen, 1973). Sometimes, the
predicted structure with the lowest energy might not be the closest to
the native structure due to imperfections in the free energy function
used. It has been shown that clustering can be used to identify the
best structure among many decoys (Shortle et (11., 1998; Zhang and
Skolnick, 2004a). This is based on the hypothesis that there are a
greater number of low-energy conformations surrounding the correct
fold than there are surrounding low-energy incorrect folds. In order
to fold efﬁciently and retain robustness to changes in amino acid
sequence as well as tolerance to structural perturbations, proteins

may have evolved a native structure situated within a broad basin
of low-energy conformations (Shortle et (11., 1998).

The exact clustering algorithm can be described brieﬂy as two
repeating steps. First, the cluster containing the structure with the
maximum number of neighbors within a predeﬁned cutoff value
is found. Second, this cluster is removed from the set remaining
to be clustered. Subsequent clusters are found by iterating these
steps until the remaining set is empty. Two of the most successful
ab initio protein folding engines, Rosetta (Das and Baker, 2008) and
I-TASSER (Wu et (11., 2007), use exact clustering in their protocol
(Bonneau et (11., 2001; Raman et (11., 2009; Skolnick, 2006; Zhang
and Skolnick, 2004a, b; Zhang et (11., 2005). In the context of
protein folding, exact clustering is used to reduce the population
of in silico generated models (also called ‘decoys’) at the end of
a folding simulation. As there is an imperfect correlation between
energy functions used during the folding process and distance to the
native structure, clustering can choose structures that are closer to
native better than selecting the lowest energy decoy (Shortle et (11.,
1998). For a good introduction to clustering, the reader is referred
to Jain et a1. (1999) and Hastie et al. (2009).

The earliest publication concerning clustering in the context of
protein folding decoy identiﬁcation seems to be from Shortle et al.
(1998). Clustering after energy ﬁltering identiﬁed conformations
close to the native structure better than when using energy as the
sole selection criterion.

By using clustering and a variant of RMSD‘, less sensitive to
protein length in the SCAR software, Betancourt and Skolnick
could decide if a protein folding simulation need more sampling
of the conformational space (Betancourt and Skolnick, 2001). If
sampling was enough, they could create representative structures of
the different fold families that were discovered.

In the ABLE folding engine, Ishida et al. used URMSD2
and Kohonen’s self-organizing maps (Kohonen, 1998) in the
clustering step of their folding protocol (Ishida et (11., 2003). Some
improvements over results obtained by Rosetta were reported.

To identify the best decoys from protein folding simulations,
Zhang and Skolnick tested their SPICKER program on 1489
protein targets (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004a). Because of the limited
computer memory, SPICKER ﬁrst shrinks the decoy set to 13k
members prior to clustering. A good correlation between the cluster
density of the biggest cluster and RMSD to native of the cluster
representative is shown. The construction of a representative decoy
for a given cluster in SPICKER is quite unique: it is an average of all

the cluster members (called a ‘centroid’). This procedure is reported
to improve RMSD to native as opposed to simply choosing the
cluster center among cluster members, albeit it can create a structure
that needs some corrections prior to reﬁnement. In 90% of the cases,
if the highest cluster density (a measure of cluster compactness) was
greater than 0.1, one of the top ﬁve cluster centroids had an RMSD
to native below 6 A. In SPICKER, the cluster cutoff value is reﬁned
automatically based on decoys distribution. Its value is ﬁxed once
the ﬁrst cluster size has reached a given percentage of the whole
decoy set or once a stop value is reached.

Faster clustering of decoys was investigated by Li and Zhou
with SCUD (Li and Zhou, 2005). Computing a distance matrix
takes considerable time [0(n2) complexity], so Li and Zhou used
an upper bound of RMSD called reference RMSD (rRMSD) to
avoid computing the optimal superposition of many decoy pairs.
A 9-fold increase in speed over brute force RMSD-based methods
was reported. The obtained clusters still had a high similarity to
the ones obtained when using RMSD. A strong correlation between
RMSD and rRMSD was shown. SCUD uses an automatic threshold
ﬁnding technique that increases the cluster cutoff until the three
biggest clusters are statistically meaningful.

Most researchers working on decoy identiﬁcation are using exact
clustering but Gront and Kolinski used hierarchical clustering.
With the Hierarchical Clustering of Protein Models software
(HCPM; http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/HCPM), partitioning of the
conformational space that was sampled during folding is possible.
HCPM can act as a data reduction ﬁlter and create libraries of
decoys with a variety of low-energy conformations (Gront and
Kolinski, 2005; Gront et (11., 2005). HCPM was also used to
identify structures with a native-like topology in the study of folding
pathway by multiscale modeling (Kmiecik and Kolinski, 2008).
HCPM incorporates a heuristic to automatically choose a clustering
threshold to obtain clusters of reasonable sizes.

A model that can predict the number of decoys necessary to obtain
a given low RMSD value from native was proposed by Li (2006).
The model can also be trained on a few decoys to predict the
minimum RMSD that would be present in a larger set of decoys.
It can also reliably estimate the fraction of decoys in the largest
cluster as a ﬁinction of cutoff value.

Handling large amounts of decoys should allow us to
ﬁnd higher quality models, compared to doing data reduction
prior to clustering (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004a). In Calibur
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/calibur/), Li and Ng try to handle
quickly large datasets (Li and Ng, 2010). Experiments with several
tens of thousands of decoys are reported. As soon as the decoy
set is larger than 4k decoys, Calibur is faster than SPICKER. The
quality of Calibur results seems to be better or at least equal to that
of SPICKER. Calibur’s algorithm is a rather intricate assembly of
three strategies. First, outlier decoys detected by a statistical test are
ﬁltered out. Second, cheap to compute lower and upper bounds of
RMSD are used as much as possible. Third, the metric property of
RMSD (Steipe, 2002) is used to avoid many distance computations.
Calibur’s default strategy for threshold ﬁnding is x-percentile based
and deduced from statistics on the dataset.

We present here the fastest method (to the best of our knowledge)
to implement exact clustering. Our method focus on efﬁcient
distance matrix initialization, the most time-consuming part of exact
clustering. This initialization step is mandatory in order to enumerate
clusters. We have implemented our method in a software called

Durandal, in reference to a mighty sword from medieval French
legends.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

Our approach to accelerate exact clustering is based on one basic idea. By
taking advantage of the metric property of RMSD (Steipe. 2002). measuring
all decoys versus a few references allows to have a coarse idea of how decoys
are distributed in the conformational space. It allows to prune out superﬂuous
computations by discovering which distances are not necessary to measure
exactly. In the case of exact clustering. knowing only a range that the distance
will fall into is enough in many cases. This range can be approximated and
narrowed down using only addition or subtraction. which is several orders
of magnitude faster than computing an RMSD.

In exact clustering (Algorithm 1). a cutoff value3 is needed as an input
parameter. The algorithm computes for each pair of decoys if it has an RMSD
less-than-or-equal-to the cutoff value or over the cutoff value. This is for
the distance matrix initialization part of the algorithm. which computes all
neighborhood relations (Deﬁnition 1). This is the most time-consuming part
of the algorithm. Next. the clusters are enumerated. The ﬁrst cluster is the one
containing the structure with the maximum number of neighbors (Deﬁnition
2) given the cutoff value. This structure is called the cluster center (Deﬁnition
3). This cluster is then removed from the initial set to be clustered. creating the
remaining set. Subsequent clusters are found by iterating the procedure until
the remaining set is empty. Exact clustering is an unsupervised clustering
algorithm.

The distance matrix used during exact clustering can be initialized naively
by computing RMSD for each distinct decoy pair (Algorithm 2). For n
decoys. it will require the computation of n(n — 1) / 2 RMSDs.

Initializing the distance matrix in an efﬁcient manner is the key part of our
approach. Knowing if two decoys are neighbors at a given cutoff is referred
to as ‘decidability’ (Deﬁnition 4). For each decoy pair. the algorithm does
not always need the exact RMSD. In many cases. knowing either the lower
or the upper bound of the distance range is enough to satisfy ‘decidability’.
We borrowed the lower and upper bounds of CaRMSD from Calibur (Li and
Ng. 2010) and SCUD (Li and Zhou. 2005). respectively. We call ‘insertion’
of information into the distance matrix as the action of measuring all decoys
against a new. randomly chosen reference decoy. We refer to ‘propagation’ as
the use of geometric constraints to propagate the newly acquired information
from the previous insertion step into the distance matrix. Only once the
distance matrix is fully decided. the algorithm can continue to the cluster
enumeration step. We deﬁne entropy of the distance matrix as the number
of decoy pairs that are still undecided (Deﬁnition 5). When we refer to the
speed of insertion or propagation (speedi. speed],). it means the decrease of
entropy during insertion or propagation (Semmpyi. (Senmpyp) divided by the
time elapsed during the corresponding step (8”. 6,”).

Entropy decrease speeds during the insertion and propagation steps are

entropy,-

therefore deﬁned as: speed,» 2 8 8’.

A crucial part of our algorithm is the propagation of distances which is as
follows:

8mm
—8 .

, speedp = W

0 given three decoys A. B and C (assuming A was randomly chosen to
be the new reference decoy);

0 we measure AB and AC exactly;

0 we subsequently sort these distances in increasing order (let us assume
AB SAC); and

0 ﬁnally. we can deduce an approximation geometrically for BC . which
is: AC —AB5BC5AC+AB.

 

3Sometimes referred to as ‘clustering threshold” or even ‘cluster cutoff ’.

Fig. 1. Generalization of the insert then propagate procedures to four decoys.
A is the reference decoy. The distances AB. AC and AD are exactly measured
while BC. CD and BD are easily approximated using ranges.

In our approach. this propagation procedure is generalized to any number
of decoys (Fig. 1). There are also some optimizations to cut into the O(n2)
complexity of propagation: once distances to the last chosen reference are
sorted. it is possible to detect early that processing more distances will not
introduce further information into the distance matrix. In this way. all the
information that could be exploited from the previous insertion step is used
and no time is lost in overexploitation. To guarantee our initialization is
faster than the naive method. we monitor at run-time the entropy decrease
speed during insertion and propagation steps. Once entropy decrease during
insertion become faster than during propagation. our algorithm falls back
to a ‘lazy” version of the naive distance matrix initialization. For each yet
undecided pair. this ‘lazy” completion of the distance matrix initialization
sequentially tries lower bound. then upper bound and ﬁnally resolves to
RMSD in case none of the previous trials removed undecidability. Our
approach to accelerate initialization of the distance matrix could be used
by any other algorithm using a metric distance.

Hereafter. the formal deﬁnitions and algorithms previously introduced in
prose are given.

(x,y) e {decoys},x 75y,d e R>0
entropy(d , {decoys}) = |(x, y) | ﬁdecidablebc, y, d)|

It is interesting to note from Deﬁnition 3 that there can be several cluster
center candidates. if they have an equal number of neighbors at cutoff
distance d. The policy to choose the cluster center out of several equally
ranked candidates is responsible for the instability of the algorithm. We
refer to these equally possible cluster centers as ‘pole position centers”. Our
implementation has a ‘stable” option. It allows to display the pole position
centers for the biggest cluster. Note that a cluster center in our deﬁnition is
not a centroid (i.e. not an average of all the cluster members as is usually

understood in the clustering literature). A cluster center in our approach is
an actual cluster member (sometimes referred to as a ‘clustroid”). contrary
to SPICKER which builds cluster representative structures by averaging all
cluster members.

Our software implementation offers two ways to choose a cutoff value.
The ﬁrst method is directly Via a user-speciﬁed value. The second method
is semiautomatic. We used the latter during our experiments as it adapts
automatically the threshold value to the spread of the decoy set. using
a percentage parameter P provided by the user. In semiautomatic mode.
Durandal will randomly sample pairwise RMSDs. and use the top P%
sampled one as the cutoff value. The sample is grown iteratively by adding
groups of 100 randomly chosen pairwise RMSDs out of the decoy set. to an
initially empty set until the median of this set is stabilized.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Accuracy

To test the useﬁilness of our approach, we compared it against
published results of SPICKER on I-TASSER decoys (Wu et (11.,
2007). We selected out of the ﬁill set 40 different protein targets.
To be included in our study, a decoy set need to contain at least one
good quality decoy (i.e. <4A CaRMSD to native). Each time, our
software was run using semiautomatic threshold ﬁnding with P = 5%
on the full decoy set (no shrinking applied). Results are shown in
Figure 2. In each histogram, the ﬁrst bar is the biggest cluster center
discovered by Durandal while the second bar is the decoy nearest to
the biggest cluster centroid computed by SPICKER [‘closc” ﬁles in
the decoy set from Wu et a1. (2007)]. The best energy decoy as well
as the nearest to native decoy from each set are shown as reference
lines; clustering is useful only if it can pick decoys better than energy.
We also tried P= 3% and P: 10% as the semiautomatic threshold
ﬁnding parameter to verify the stability of our method. The maximal
variation observed when using these different P-values in terms of
average CaRMSD to native was only around 1.2%.

In our tests, in 25 out of 40 cases the biggest cluster center
found by Durandal was nearer to native compared with the best
energy decoy (20 out of 40 cases for SPICKER). On average,
when comparing the chosen decoy from each method to the

In order to evaluate the speed gained with our method, we
measured its execution times on some I-TASSER decoys while
varying set size. We also tested our method on the ‘semfold’
decoy set (Samudrala and Levitt, 2002) (Downloaded from
http://dd.compbio.washington.edu/). We compared elapsed times to
that of Calibur, which is the fastest software we know that is capable
of performing the same task. We also compared elapsed times to that
of SCUD which is an approximate method. Calibur was extensively
tested against SPICKER and shown to be signiﬁcantly faster when
working on large decoy sets (Li and Ng, 2010). Hence, we did not
redo a comparison in speed with SPICKER.

All software were compiled using the highest optimization
level (-O3) of their needed compiler. Durandal and Calibur
are using the same routines to compute CaRMSD. All
experiments were performed using exactly uniform computer
cluster nodes. The PAR (Berenger et al., 2010) software

not vary as a ﬁinction of the clustering threshold. However, the
Calibur and Durandal run-times vary in a difﬁcult to predict manner
as a ﬁinction of the clustering threshold and the distribution of
decoys in the set. Durandal’s run-time is also inﬂuenced by which
references are used. All methods’ speeds are inﬂuenced by the
number of decoys in the set and the number of residues. Calibur
was run without outlier ﬁltering (to ensure exact clustering of the
whole set is performed, as Durandal does). During Durandal runs,
random reference selection was used to avoid input order bias. If
references being used do not differ much from each other because
they are chosen sequentially from the input ﬁles list and this list
is somewhat ordered, it would penalize our algorithm. Results of
comparison in speed with Calibur and SCUD while varying the
decoy set size are shown in Figure 5. Accelerations observed on
the ‘semfold’ decoy set are shown in Table 1. As a test to verify
that both Calibur and Durandal implement correctly the exact
clustering algorithm, some output ﬁles were randomly chosen and
compared, showing a consistent 100% cluster similarity among
the three biggest clusters (smaller clusters were not saved during
experiments as Calibur outputs only top three by default).

In Figure 5, the bump in Calibur run-times observed for set
sizes larger than 13k decoys is due to a change of storage data
structure at run-time (a default Calibur behavior that the user has no
control over). In Figure 5, the average acceleration rate obtained by
Durandal compared with Calibur is 2.53 and 1.74 compared with
SCUD. In Table 1, our method is shown to be consistently faster
than Calibur and can even outperform SCUD in some cases.

4 DISCUSSION

Distance matrix computation is the most time consuming part of
exact clustering. It is interesting to look at how the same problem
was approached in two different ways by Calibur and Durandal.
Calibur’s algorithm grows clusters stepwise in an online manner.
Calibur’s focus is targeted at grouping together proximate decoys
so the problem is looked from a spatial organization viewpoint.
Durandal computes clusters off-line, once enough information is
known regarding distances of all decoy pairs. Distance information
are inserted into the distance matrix using methods to maximize

The lower clustering threshold for each target was chosen so that the ﬁrst cluster
is statistically signiﬁcant. Calibur and Durandal are exact methods while SCUD is
approximate. The acceleration rates labeled ‘SCUD’ or ‘Calibur’ in the table are the
total run-time of ‘SCUD’ or ‘Calibur’ divided by the total run-time of ‘Durandal’.

the speed of the procedure. Durandal attacks the problem using an
information-centered approach. One of the consequences of these
different strategies is that Calibur does not fully exploit some of the
expensive methods to compute information it collects. In Calibur,
some previously computed distances or their bounds are used to
avoid computing some more distances, but this information does
not percolate through all clusters. Whereas in Durandal, as long as
inserting then propagating new distance information is the fastest
strategy, information is exploited to the maximum.

Both SPICKER and Durandal implement the same clustering
algorithm. However, some slight differences remain. Both methods
use different automatic threshold-ﬁnding strategies, decoy selection
technique and energy ﬁltering. Concerning threshold-ﬁnding
strategy, SPICKER follows a cutoff reﬁnement algorithm (Zhang
and Skolnick, 2004a) while Durandal picks a value after some quick
sampling of the decoy set. Durandal’s way is close to Calibur’s
default threshold-ﬁnding strategy. For decoy selection, SPICKER
selects the decoy nearest to the cluster centroid while Durandal
selects the cluster center as understood in Deﬁnition 3. Moreover,
Durandal clusters ﬁill decoy sets without applying additional energy
ﬁltering, whereas SPICKER reduces the decoy set to 13k decoys
maximum using an energy criterion. When the energy ﬁinction is
inaccurate, Durandal may beneﬁt more from the averaging effect of
clustering.

We have addressed the problem of clustering speed to a large
extent with Durandal. However, the memory requirement issue
has not been dealt with. The memory requirement grows in the
same order as that of the naive algorithm. This is an important
problem. Clustering acceleration can be tackled using geometric
constraints as we did. If the distance measure being used is not
a metric, our approach cannot be applied to speed up the process
by reducing the number of calls to the distance function. The
memory problem is not easy to address; if the distance matrix were
stored on disk, the overall clustering procedure would become an
order of magnitude slower due to the higher disk access latency
compared with memory. Algorithms avoiding the memory size
problem should work under the constraint: being able to cluster
without requiring that the ﬁill distance matrix is available in memory.
In this aspect, despite Calibur’s speed being far from optimal, it
is worthwhile noticing that it is quite thrifty regarding memory
consumption.

Concerning the optimum choice of reference decoys in Durandal,
previous work employing a metric distance in the problem of best-
match search showed that there is an optimal heuristic to choose
reference points (Shapiro, 1977). Reference points should be away
from cluster centers. However, the exact distance away, as well as
the number of reference points to use is unclear. Concerning the
number of references to consider, our algorithm uses an entropy
decrease speed criterion to detect if we are starting to use too many
of them in order to trigger a fallback from the insert-propagate step
to the lazy-completion one. Durandal uses chance in its reference
point choice policy. Based on our experience using Durandal, the
speed criterion combined with random reference selection creates
an efﬁcient and simple heuristic.

Some distributed algorithm could push even further the scalability
of clustering large decoy sets, both in terms of speed and memory
requirements. In the distributed case, the problem would probably
be no longer just about fast clustering where our algorithm could be
used. The challenge may become how to efﬁciently merge and store
intermediate clustering results from partitions of a whole decoy set.
Possibly, some small overlapping in the partitions could accelerate
the procedure by merging ﬁrst reference structures from both sets.
Afterwards, many distance measures would be avoided. If the user is
not interested in parallelizing computations, the parallel version of
the program could still be used to overcome the memory barrier by
running it sequentially on a single computer. Partitioning the initial
set, and then clustering each subset before incrementally merging
results seems a feasible approach.

We hope the method we proposed will help the protein folding
community in the decoy identiﬁcation step of their protocols. The
acceleration technique we detailed may be of interest to other
scientiﬁc or engineering ﬁelds and may be adapted to other clustering
algorithms.

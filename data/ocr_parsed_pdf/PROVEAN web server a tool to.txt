Abstract

Summary: We present a web server to predict the functional effect of single or multiple amino acid
substitutions, insertions and deletions using the prediction tool PROVEAN. The server provides
rapid analysis of protein variants from any organisms, and also supports high—throughput analysis
for human and mouse variants at both the genomic and protein levels.

Availability and implementation: The web server is freely available and open to all users with no

login requirements at http://provean.jcvi.org.

1 Introduction

Large scale genotyping and genome re-sequencing projects have gen-
erated a large amount of sequence variant data for healthy and dis-
eased individuals in human and model organisms. Sequence variants
may reside in the protein-coding or non-coding regions of the gen-
ome. Whereas non-coding variants can potentially play a regulatory
role and affect gene expression, coding variants can affect protein
function and activity by altering the gene product such as substitu-
tion, insertion or deletion of amino acids, frameshift or truncation.
As the number of genome-wide variants is usually large, it is a
challenging problem to identify the causal variant for a disease or
specific phenotype of interest. For this purpose, computational tools
such as PolyPhen (Adzhubei et (11., 2010; Sunyaev et (11., 1999) and
SIFT (Kumar et (11., 2009; Ng and Henikoff, 2001) were developed
to provide functional predictions for coding variants. Since then
many other tools have been developed until recently (Cooper and
Shendure, 2011; Ng and Henikoff, 2006). We have developed a new
tool Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN), which uses an
alignment-based score approach (Choi, 2012; Choi et (11., 2012).
Unlike most existing tools, PROVEAN can generate predictions not
only for single amino acid substitutions but also for multiple amino
acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions using the same underly-

ing scoring scheme.

As the original PROVEAN web server (Choi et (11., 2012) was
limited to supporting the analysis of single protein queries, we have
expanded the PROVEAN web server to support high-throughput
online analysis using the PROVEAN tool. The PROVEAN web
server can now provide precomputed prediction for large sets of gen-
ome-wide nucleotide or amino acid variants for both human and
mouse. For the original single protein query function, run time has
been greatly improved in the current new version by storing and
reusing previously computed homologous protein sequences (sup-
porting sequences) information for query proteins.

2 Results

2.1 Background

The PROVEAN method has been previously described and validated
(Choi et (11., 2012). To build a large database of precomputed
PROVEAN scores, an efficient method to compute the pairwise
alignment scores between a protein sequence and a large number of
single-locus variations of another protein has been previously
developed (Choi, 2012).

2.2 Web server function
The web server currently supports three functions: (i) PROVEAN

(human and mouse) and (iii) PROVEAN Genome Variants (human
and mouse). The web server is supported by an in—house MySQL
database. Major data tables include Ensembl gene annotation, pre—
computed PROVEAN scores and precomputed supporting se—
quences for all protein sequences from human and mouse, and
supporting sequence sets captured from first—time online user sub—
missions of protein sequences that may originate from any organ—
isms. The web server uses multiple queues for job submissions based
on the expected job size so that small jobs are handled promptly on
a designated queue to ensure a fast turnover. The database schema
and data structure used in each of the three web server functions are
described in the following subsections.

2.2.1 PROVEAN protein

The ‘PROVEAN Protein” tool provides online access to the function
of the stand—alone PROVEAN software package distribution. Its pri—
mary function is to provide a prediction for a protein sequence origi—
nated from any organisms. The tool accepts a protein sequence and
amino acid variations as input, performs a BLAST search to identify
homologous sequences (supporting sequences), and generates
PROVEAN scores. In general, it takes 10—20 min to generate predic—
tion for a given protein query. To improve performance, we have
implemented a caching approach to by—pass the most time—
consuming steps of protein database search to collect homologous
sequences, and clustering. In the caching approach, the supporting
sequences for all first—time protein query submissions were stored. A
list of sequence identifiers for the supporting sequences and cluster—
ing information are stored in the database. The supporting sequence
data are indexed based on the query protein sequence and reused in
subsequent prediction requests. We showed that the implementation
of the caching approach for intermediate results greatly reduces the
overall run time from several minutes to a few seconds.

2.2.2 PROVEAN protein batch

The ‘PROVEAN Protein Batch” function supports batch processing
for a large number of protein variations based on precomputes. The
input is a list of protein variations, with each variation consisting of
a public protein identifier, amino acid position, reference amino
acid, and variant amino acid. Public protein identifiers supported by
this function include those from NCBI RefSeq (e.g. NP_000537.3),
UniProt (e.g. P13569) and Ensembl (e.g. ENSP00000363868). Two
approaches have been implemented to ensure a fast response time:
precomputed scores and precomputed supporting sequences.

In the first approach, PROVEAN scores are directly retrieved
from a database with precomputed scores. The precomputed scores
have been generated for all protein sequences in our supported or—
ganisms (~90 k human and ~46 k mouse proteins) using the method
described in (Choi, 2012). The precomputed scores cover 20 single
amino acid substitutions and one amino acid deletion for every
amino acid position.

In the second approach, PROVEAN prediction starts from pre—
computed supporting sequences. Due to a potentially infinitely large
number of combinations for multiple amino acid substitutions,
insertions and deletions, the precomputed score approach is not ap—
plicable for all different types and lengths of amino acid changes.
Thus, a supporting sequence set is precomputed and stored for every
protein sequence in our supported organisms. The supporting se—
quence sets are then used for fast computation of prediction for
amino acid variations that are not supported by the precomputed
score approach. The scores computed in this approach are stored in
database and reused for requests for the same variants.

2.2.3 PROVEAN genome variants

The ‘PROVEAN Genome Variants” function supports batch process—
ing for a large number of variations found across the entire genome.
This tool accepts a list of genomic variations such as single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide substitutions, insertions
or deletions. First, the genomic variations are classified as coding and
non—coding variations based on the reference genome sequence and
the Ensembl gene annotation. Second, the coding variants are classi—
fied at the protein sequence level as amino acid substitutions, inser—
tions, deletions, nonsense mutations or frameshifts. For amino acid
substitutions, insertions and deletions, PROVEAN scores and predic—
tions are obtained in a similar approach as described above in the
PROVEAN Protein Batch function. That is, the PROVEAN scores
are either retrieved from the in—house database or computed using
precomputed supporting sequence set information. The PROVEAN
Genome Variants function also provides accessory information for
the genomic variation input data including NCBI dbSNP reference ac—
cessions, and gene annotation obtained from Ensembl BioMart such
as gene description, PFAM domain and Gene Ontology. The steps for
this function are shown in a flowchart in the Supplementary Material
(Supplementary Fig. 51).

For efficient data storage, the PROVEAN scores are stored not
at the genome level but at the protein sequence level. The coordinate
conversion from genome variants to the corresponding protein vari—
ants is achieved instantaneously by real—time dynamic conversion.
To support efficient coordinate conversion, the original Ensembl
gene annotation in GFF/GTF format is re—organized so that each
chromosomal position in the coding region is stored in a record
along with the underlying nucleotide, codon triplet, reading frame,
position of the codon in amino acid, gene ID and gene orientation.
Given a single nucleotide variant in a coding region, the record for
the specific chromosomal position is retrieved. The amino acid
change can be quickly determined based on the codon and reading
frame information in the record. The conversion for other types of
genomic variants to protein level alterations requires additional
steps but can be achieved in a similarly straightforward way via the
chromosomal position records.

3 Discussion

To provide binary predictions, the cutoff for PROVEAN scores was
set to —2.5 for high balanced accuracy. However, users can reapply
their own cutoffs for their analysis to achieve either higher sensitiv—
ity or higher specificity. The sensitivity and specificity obtained
using different score cutoffs are shown in the Supplementary
Material (Supplementary Fig. 52).

It was shown that the performance of PROVEAN for single
amino acid substitutions is comparable with other tools (Choi et al.,
2012). Here we also examine the prediction consistency with other
tools, SIFT and PolyPhen—2, using the UniProt human polymorph—
isms and disease mutations dataset. The three tools agree on a large
portion of the variants, but there are still many variants for which
three tools make different predictions. The results are summarized
using Venn diagrams in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary
Fig. S3).

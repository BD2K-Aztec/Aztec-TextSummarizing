yielded enrichments in processes such as DNA replication and
repair, programmed cell death, and RNA processing and trans—
lation pathways. Additionally we found multiple members of
certain gene families displaying this splicing. Of the human
genes identiﬁed, these included the Interleukin receptors (ﬁve
members), the Eukaryotic Initiators of Translation (eight mem—
bers) and the Solute Carrier families (41 members).

3.2 Conservation of splice events between human and
mouse

Comparing the splicing events found in human and mouse iden—
tiﬁed 40 instances of conserved alternative splicing between the
two species (Table 2). The conservation of these forms implies
likely evolutionary selection. As well as the 40 genes displaying
conserved splicing, we found an additional 102 genes that, while
displaying this form of splicing in both human and mouse, did
not produce conserved proteins. The relatively low species con—
servation is consistent with recent ﬁndings showing that alterna—
tive splicing is often species—speciﬁc (Barbosa—Morais et al., 2012;
Merkin et al., 2012).

3.3 Secondary structure of splice sites

Analysis of the secondary structure surrounding the alternate
splice junctions showed that in both human and mouse, the al—
ternate 5/ junctions were predicted to possess a lower secondary
structure and the 3/ junctions a higher level of structure when
compared to a control group (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).
Given the inﬂuence of mRNA secondary structure on alternative

splicing (Buratti and Baralle, 2004) these results may suggest a
method of regulation, although the precise mechanism remains
unclear.

3.4 Prevalence of Kozak sequences

Identiﬁcation of these splice events using ESTs provides strong
evidence for their transcription. Translation of these alternative
splice forms however, relies on the translation machinery cor—
rectly identifying the alternate start codon, a process often
mediated by the Kozak sequence (Kozak 1986, 1997). We there—
fore investigated the context in which the start codons were pre—
sented, paying attention to both the canonical and alternate start
sites. We classiﬁed the surrounding sequence as either an optimal

 

153

L.O.W.Wilson et al.

 

Kozak sequence (deﬁned as AnnATGn or GnnATGG), a sub—
optimal Kozak sequence (deﬁned as [C/T]nnATG[A/C/T]) or no
Kozak sequence (Bazykin and Kochetov, 2010; Kochetov 2008;
Volkova and Kochetov, 2010). Full results are given in
Supplementary Tables $1 and S2. In human, 66% of the canon—
ical start sites were found within an optimal Kozak sequence as
opposed to 37% of the alternate sites (64% versus 37% for
mouse). For both species, the alternate start sites were distributed
evenly between optimal and sub—optimal Kozak sequences.
Interestingly, the Kozak signals of the conserved alternate start
sites appeared to be more likely to exist in an optimal Kozak
sequence (47.5% of conserved sites versus 36.9% of non—
conserved).

3.5 Proteomic evidence for the translation of the
alternative splice forms

Ultimately, translation needs to be proven experimentally. We
therefore adopted a proteomics approach, searching for evidence
of the proteins in publicly available Mass Spectrometry (MS)
data. As our proteins differ from the canonical forms only in
the amino—terminus, such an approach is difﬁcult because ﬁrst, in
order to be identiﬁed the alternate protein must produce unique
peptides of appropriate length upon tryptic digestion, and se—
cond, such a peptide (matching either fully or in part to the
altered amino terminus) must be identiﬁed in the MS experiment.
By reanalyzing raw spectra from two human and mouse experi—
ments, we found evidence supporting the translation of 19 novel
human and seven novel mouse proteins. We used stringent
search criteria corresponding to a protein false detection rate
of 6.69% for human and 5.95% for mouse (i.e. no more than
one match is likely to be a false positive).

The mouse MS data came from experiments on brain and
testes. Four of the seven splice variants were represented by an
EST derived from brain (or embryo upper head) and one by an
EST derived from mouse testicles. Thus, the tissue derivation of
the ESTs matches the provenance of the MS datasets, providing
strong support for the validity of our search strategy. Such a
correlation was not observed in human as the MS data were
derived from blood and a leukemic cell line rather than speciﬁc
tissues. The identiﬁcation of examples of alternate proteins in
these MS datasets therefore provides independent proof of con—
cept, indicating that these alternate isoforms can indeed be trans—
lated into proteins.

3.6 Evidence for the selection of alternate start codons

Ribosome profiling is a technique that identiﬁes mRNAs
undergoing translation within a cell, by determining what

transcripts are bound by ribosomes (Ingolia et al., 2009). In
2012, Lee et a]. modified the technique to identify translation
initiation sites in both a human and mouse cell line (Lee et al.,
2012). By comparing their list of identiﬁed translation initiation
sites to our list of predicted alternate start codons, we were able
to ﬁnd evidence supporting our annotations for 35 instances in
human and three in mouse (full list provided in Supplementary
Tables $1 and S2). This provides direct evidence that the trans—
lational machinery can utilize the alternate start codon predicted
by our pipeline.

3.7 Prediction of functional effects of alternative splicing

The selective modiﬁcation of the N—terminus may allow for the
regulation or change of protein function. Given the preference
for localization signals to be found within the amino—terminus,
one possibility is that this method of splicing can regulate a pro—
tein’s subcellular localization. To assess this, we compared the
predicted localization of each of the canonical and alternate pro—
tein isoforms using the Wolf pSort program (Horton et al.,
2007). Of the mouse and human proteins >50% were predicted
to change their localization due to these alternative splicing
events (examples provided in Table 3, full results in
Supplementary Tables $1 and S2).

Another key determinant in modiﬁcation of protein function
is the selective removal or addition of functional domains. In
order to investigate this possibility, we used the Pfam software
suite (v1.3) (Punta et al., 2012) to identify differences in potential
functional domains between the canonical and alternate isoforms
(full data presented in Supplementary Tables $1 and S2;
examples provided in Table 3).

One or more functional domains are predicted to be removed
upon splicing in 33% and 38% of the human and mouse genes,
respectively. In comparison, only a small number of the events
were predicted to add a functional domain (six in mouse and 19
in human). Of the genes predicted to change their functional
domains, 57% of the human proteins and 64% of the mouse
proteins are also predicted to change their subcellular localiza—
tions. By pairing these two functional effects, this method of
alternative splicing may produce protein isoforms that display
unique functions and are located in separate cellular
compartments.

4 CONCLUSION

The aim of this study was to investigate an unusual outcome of
alternative splicing that results in the amino terminal exons of a
gene being translated in two reading frames. Our pipeline

Novel human and mouse protein isoforms

 

predicted a total of 2582 instances of this splicing in the mouse
and human genomes, the majority of which have not been pre—
viously annotated.

Previous large—scale studies have treated genes as possessing a
single start codon, only considering alternate sites of translation
initiation when a splice event removes the canonical start codon.
A few studies have investigated the potential of alternate start
codons, but these have focused on either downstream, in—frame,
start codons that produce truncated versions of proteins
(Bazykin and Kochetov, 2010), or those that result in a frame
shift of the entire transcript (Chung et al, 2007; Xu et al, 2010).
Our study is the ﬁrst to investigate the prevalence of this unusual
amino—terminus frame—shifting form of alternative splicing.

Our search strategy identiﬁed three of the four published in—
stances of this alternative splicing. Upon further inspection, it
was found that Inpp4b was not detected due to low EST cover—
age. The Unigene database contained only 58 ESTs associated
with Inpp4b, none of which encode the experimentally validated
splice variant. The 2582 splice forms we have identiﬁed are there—
fore likely to be an underestimate of the true frequency of this
splicing. Low EST coverage of genes hides instances of this
splicing (as seen in Inpp4b) in addition, variants transcribed at
low levels or under restrictive conditions (such as in speciﬁc cell
subsets or under particular metabolic conditions) may not be
represented in databases.

Only one of the 2582 splice variants we have identiﬁed, otu—
bain—l, has been previously functionally characterized and was
found to have a dramatic effect on the function of the protein
(Soares et al, 2004). While the canonical form of the protein
activated T—cells, the alternate form was found to promote T—
cell anergy (turn off T—cells). The profound functional difference
found in the only one of these genes studied, coupled with our
predictions for alterations in domain composition and subcellu—
lar localization, highlights the potential importance of the novel
proteins we have identiﬁed.

In this study, we have identiﬁed >2000 novel protein isoforms
in human and mouse genomes. These result from an unusual
outcome of alternative splicing, combining frame—shifting splice
variants with alternative start codons. This largely overlooked
form of alternative splicing therefore contributes significantly to
transcriptome diversity. In each case, the novel proteins differ
from their known isoforms by their amino terminus being trans—
lated from an alternate reading frame; the remainder of the pro—
tein is identical in both isoforms. This can result in a profound
change to protein function. The proteins we have identiﬁed are
involved in a wide range of biological processes. Research into the
biological functions of these novel proteins will therefore open
new avenues of research into almost every facet of cell biology.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are considered
the most frequently occurring DNA sequence variations. Several com-
putational methods have been proposed for the classification of mis-
sense SNPs to neutral and disease associated. However, existing
computational approaches fail to select relevant features by choosing
them arbitrarily without sufficient documentation. Moreover, they are
limited to the problem of missing values, imbalance between the learn-
ing datasets and most of them do not support their predictions with
confidence scores.

Results: To overcome these limitations, a novel ensemble computa-
tional methodology is proposed. EnsembleGASVR facilitates a two-
step algorithm, which in its first step applies a novel evolutionary
embedded algorithm to locate close to optimal Support Vector
Regression models. In its second step, these models are combined
to extract a universal predictor, which is less prone to overfitting
issues, systematizes the rebalancing of the learning sets and uses
an internal approach for solving the missing values problem without
loss of information. Confidence scores support all the predictions and
the model becomes tunable by modifying the classification thresholds.
An extensive study was performed for collecting the most relevant
features for the problem of classifying SNPs, and a superset of 88
features was constructed. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework outperforms well-known algorithms in terms of
classification performance in the examined datasets. Finally, the
proposed algorithmic framework was able to uncover the significant
role of certain features such as the solvent accessibility feature, and
the top-scored predictions were further validated by linking them with
disease phenotypes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype
is a fundamental problem in biology and biomedicine. Today,
genome-wide sequencing combined with high-throughput plat-
forms deliver significant improvements over older methods for
identifying DNA sequence variations (Abecasis et al., 2010).
One of the most common types of genetic variation in humans
is the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A particular
subcategory of SNPs called non-synonymous coding SNPs
(nsSNPs) or missense SNPs refers to a single base substitution
in a coding region that causes an amino acid substitution in the
corresponding protein. The effects of nsSNPs in molecular func-
tion range from complete neutrality to disease susceptibility and
lethality (Manolio et al., 2009). Coding-region SNPs not only
characterize human evolution and diversity (Goldstein and
Cavalleri, 2005) but are also associated with drug sensitivity
(Giacomini et al., 2007) and disease susceptibility (Bell, 2004).
Classifying nsSNPs according to their phenotypic effects has an
important insinuation for understanding several diseases and
exploring genetic ancestry, evolution and diversity among species
(Cargill et al., 1999).

Consequently, the effective characterization of polymorphic
variations emerges as a challenging area of research. Testing
experimentally the relationship between nsSNPs and diseases is
not a trivial task and has several disadvantages in terms of cost
and time (V alentini et al., 2002). For this purpose, several com-
putational methods have been developed (Thusberg et al., 2011).
From the algorithmic perspective, there are two types of existing
methodologies. The ﬁrst type concerns the sequence homology
methods that apply conservation analysis of amino acids substi-
tutions among evolutionarily related proteins (Ng and Henikoff,
2001; Thomas et al., 2003). In principle, highly conserved resi-
dues in the polypeptide chain seem to be intolerant to amino acid
substitutions, whereas positions with low degree of conservation
allow more substitution without affecting protein functionality.
The latter type regards Machine Learning (ML) methods that
reformulate the characterization problem to a classiﬁcation task
and categorize polymorphisms into neutral or pathogenic based
on structural, functional, sequential and evolutionary attributes.
Up to now, several classiﬁcation techniques have been applied
including Artificial Neural Networks (Bromberg and Rost,
2007), Random Forests (Li et al., 2009), Na'1've Bayes classiﬁers

(Adzhubei et al., 2010) and Support Vector Machines (SVM;
Acharya and Nagarajaram, 2012).

Although these methods have led to the characterization of a
great number of SNPs and achieve high classiﬁcation perform-
ance, they have so far been limited by several disadvantages
(Thusberg et al., 2011). For instance, features used for classiﬁca-
tion are chosen arbitrarily without sufﬁcient documentation (Hu
and Yan, 2008). Furthermore, the feature selection process,
which is of great importance for several bioinformatics problems
(Saeys et al., 2007), is not systematized (Huang et al., 2010).
Additionally, handling imbalanced pathogenic and neutral
datasets is another obstacle that the existing methodologies fail
to tackle efﬁciently (Wei and Dunbrack, 2013). Similar to other
bioinformatics applications, the problem of missing values is also
present and restricts the generalization ability of the developed
models. The effective imputation of missing features without loss
of information or expensive computations are aspects that
require further consideration.

In this study, a novel ML methodology called
EnsembleGASVR is introduced. EnsembleGASVR is an
embedded classiﬁcation technique, which combines an
Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (GA) with nu-Support Vector
Regression (nu-SVR), through an ensemble algorithmic frame-
work. EnsembleGASVR predicts whether a given nsSNP is
pathogenic or neutral, based on an extensive feature set that
contains the most indicative features proposed in the literature.
The feature selection component is integrated to the learning
phase of the methodology and uses an adaptive GA for selecting
relevant feature subsets. Simultaneously, the GA optimizes the
nu—SVR parameters using a novel objective function tailored to
the problem-related requirements. Also, to deal with the problem
of missing values in the datasets, alleviate the class imbalance
lying in the examined datasets and raise the algorithm’s overall
performance, EnsembleGASVR combines eight individual clas-
sification models that extend the proposed algorithm to function
as an ensemble technique. Speciﬁcally, for the classiﬁcation of a
single SNP, only models for which this particular SNP has miss-
ing values below a predefined threshold are deployed to classify
it. By training multiple classiﬁers and using a ﬁtness function
specialized for imbalanced bioinformatics datasets, we take ad-
vantage of our full dataset distribution, while at the same time we
reduce the effects of class imbalance. The combined action of
multiple classiﬁers enables the acquisition of an extremely
robust regression technique, which could be used to classify
SNPs and assign scores for every prediction. Moreover, by vary-
ing the ensemble classiﬁcation threshold, EnsembleGASVR
becomes tunable in terms of sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithmic
technique outperformed existing methods in the datasets,
which were used in this study, and leads to the automatic iden-
tiﬁcation of a small and consistent subset of polymorphic fea-
tures. EnsembleGASVR achieves a correct prediction rate of
87.45% and a geometric mean of 82%, tested on an independent
human nsSNPs dataset. A set of four features appears to be
present in all the eight extracted independent SVR models, and
useful conclusions are made about their role in characterizing
SNPs. Moreover, one newly introduced feature, Protein
Essentiality, is selected in six of the eight SVR models indicating
its importance in classifying nsSNPs.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets and features

The data generation process follows the methodology described in a com-
prehensive review of nine computational prediction methods (Thusberg
et al., 2011). The pathogenic dataset was extracted from PhenCode data-
base and contains non-synonymous SNPs that affect human phenotype
(September 2012 registry) (Giardine et al., 2007). Only nsSNPs annotated
as disease causing in SwissProt (Yip et al., 2008) were included. SwissProt
provides high-quality curated information about potential relationship of
missense mutations and diseases and enhances the pool of pathogenic
samples in our collection. The neutral dataset contains nsSNPs that
have not yet been associated with any disease according to dbSNP data-
base (Sherry et al., 2001). dbSNP is freely accessible and provides data in
a variety of formats. From the dbSNP FTP service, we downloaded the
ASN.1 ﬂat files (Build 135, September 2012 registry), containing detailed
information about all human genetic variants, grouped according to their
chromosomal site. Then, the entries were ﬁltered to meet the following
criteria: (i) only non-synonymous (missense) SNPs are contained; (ii) have
been validated and have not been withdrawn (validated = YES, not-
withdrawn); (iii) have not been annotated as pathogenic or probable-
pathogenic; (iv) have minimum allele frequency >00]; and (v) have
been reported in at least 25 individuals (50 chromosomes). By applying
these constraints, we tried to eliminate the number of disease-associated
variants in our neutral dataset. dbSNP entries that contained links to
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database were discarded.
Finally, the two datasets were compared and duplicate records in both
sets were removed, to minimize the probability of false-negative and false-
positive cases in the neutral and pathogenic sets, respectively. We ended
up with a pathogenic dataset of 17 743 nsSNPs, obtained from 2147 dif-
ferent protein sequences and a neutral dataset of 48 684 nsSNPs, obtained
from 16 534 different protein sequences.

Regarding the feature set construction, we studied features proposed
by nine computational methods (Thusberg et al., 2011). From this big
pool of proposed characteristics, 87 representative attributes that have
adequate documentation and describe the amino acid sequence, protein
functionality, structural properties and evolutionary conservation were
selected. The computation of the feature vector was accomplished deploy-
ing existing tools and scripts written by us for the cases where no publicly
available program existed. Additionally, one new characteristic was also
introduced: protein essentiality that describes whether the nsSNPs are
obtained from essential proteins (DEG database data were used).
The essential proteins are vital for the maintenance of life, as their
malfunction can be fatal for the organism. It has been also indicated
that mutations in the corresponding essential genes are directly related
to the occurrence of many diseases (Furney et al., 2006). The protein
domains feature, which refers to nsSNPs that belong to a conserved
protein domain, was computed for the ﬁrst time using the
InterProScan v5 software package (Quevillon et al., 2005). The utilization
of InterProScan decreased the feature’s missing values compared with its
calculation using only Pfam domains software (Punta et a], 2012). Protein
domains are conserved protein regions that can perform their speciﬁc
function independently or in coordination with neighboring domains.
Therefore, the speciﬁc location of nsSNPs within the protein can be cru-
cial for characterizing their impact (Zhang et al., 2009). Table 1 presents
the feature set categories, and a detailed description of the features can be
found in the Supplementary Table S].

2.2 GASVR algorithm

EnsembleGASVR is an embedded classiﬁcation system that uses a hybrid
combination of GA and nu-SVR classiﬁer. SVR classiﬁers are a common
form of SVMs of broad applicability to many pattern recognition
problems. In principle, SVR presents high classiﬁcation performance
and low complexity because it relies on a subset of training data and

uses a simpliﬁed cost function for building the model (Kwon and Moon,
2007). In contrast to regular SVM classiﬁer, the nu-SVR outputs are real
values that can be used as scores to support predictions. In addition,
based on the application requirements, nu-SVR models become tunable
in terms of sensitivity and sensitivity by modifying the decision threshold.
GAs are stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithms that have been
inspired by evolutionary biology principles (Holland, 1975). The most
relevant aspect of GAs is their ability to explore efﬁciently large search
spaces and identify possible solutions, without getting trapped in local
optimal. Moreover, they present high abilities to explore the search space
and locate near-to-optimal solutions. In EnsembleGASVR’s ﬁrst step, an
adaptive GA is deployed to tune nu-SVR parameters, which are as
follows: (i) classiﬁer parameters C and nu; (ii) Radial basis kernel
bandwidth gamma; and (iii) classification threshold. Additionally, the
combination of nu-SVR and GA systematizes the feature selection
process and identiﬁes relevant subsets of features under the embedded
feature selection setting.

In the GA framework, each chromosome is a binary string that
encodes feature subset and parameters values. Speciﬁcally, a 142-bit
string is used where 88 bits encode features, 10 bits represent each of
the parameters nu and threshold (integer and decimal part), 14 bits
correspond to gamma value and 20 bits are used for the parameter
C. A rank-based roulette wheel selection method controls the selection
of the best candidates in each GA generation (Hancock, 1994). This
selection mechanism is preferred compared with the single roulette
wheel selection to raise the selection pressure toward better solu-
tions when all solutions of the population have present similar ﬁtness
values.

Elitism is used to force the best solution of each population to be
selected at least once in the next generation. The evaluation of each
chromosome in the population is performed according to the following
ﬁtness function:

Fitness = a » Accuracy -i- b > GeometricMean

» Support Vectors (l)

l l
— A 2 A — L—L _ .—
c 10 MSE d 88 Features e 4151

where Accuracy is the nu-SVR’s accuracy, GeometricMean refers to the
geometric mean of sensitivity and speciﬁcity, MSE is the mean square of

errors, Features represent the size of selected feature set and
SupportVectors is the number of support vectors, included in the trained
nu-SVR model. The geometric mean is used to handle the imbalance
between positive and negative training examples (Akbani and Kwek,
2004). The term SupportVectors in the ﬁtness function allows
EnsembleGASVR to use technical information of the nu-SVR classiﬁca-
tion model, in contrast to other wrapper methods that have been recently
proposed in the literature, which use only the classiﬁer’s performance.
Speciﬁcally, smaller and simpler SVR models are preferred, as they pre-
sent better generalization properties. The range of the examined variables
in the proposed ﬁtness function where Accuracy 6 [0, 1], GeometricMean
E [0, l], MSE e [0, 0.01], Features 6 [1-Max_Features], where
Max_Features is the maximum number of features that can be selected
by our method (in our case 88), and SupportVectors e[1, Training_Size],
where Training_Size is the number of training examples. These variables
were multiplied with certain constants to normalize their values to range
from 0 to 1. The constants a, b, c, d and e in Equation (1) are user-
speciﬁed weights. The following values were assigned without experi-
mentation: a = 0.5, b = 0.5, c = 0.01, d = 0.005 and e = 0.001. These
values were selected to reﬂect the priorities of the goals for classifying
missense SNPs. Using these values, EnsembleGASVR achieves high
classiﬁcation performance and simultaneously generates a simple and
effective model. The order of our objectives signiﬁcance may be ex-
tracted by observing the weight value of each separate goal. So, the
classiﬁcation accuracy, the geometric mean and the MSE of the classi-
ﬁer are the most signiﬁcant, with the number of selected features being
less signiﬁcant and the number of the support vectors being the least
signiﬁcant objective. To avoid overﬁtting problems, we did not attempt
to optimize these values.

Then the differentiation operators, crossover and mutation are applied
to the top-ranked candidate solutions to create a new population. The
crossover operator applies 2-point crossover to obtain a new offspring
from two parents. In our current implementation, the crossover rate is
constant and set to 0.9. This rate increases the variability of the crossover
operator and with a small probability candidate solutions pass to the next
generation unaffected. This property is essential when good solutions
emerge in early stages of the algorithm.

To achieve the desired trade-off between exploration and exploitation,
EnsembleGASVR uses an adaptive mutation rate. The mutation rate is

where n is the current generation, PS is the population size and MAXG is
the maximum generation, as deﬁned by the termination criteria, and A_S
is the average similarity between the members of the population and its
best member. The proposed adaptive mutation operator attempts to per-
form global optimization in its ﬁrst iterations while gradually switching
its behavior to local optimization. The value 0.2 was selected in the
Equation (2) as an extremely high-mutation probability value that trans-
forms the proposed algorithm to a random search algorithm in its ﬁrst
steps. To avoid getting trapped in local optima, the average similarity of
each chromosome with the best individual of the population is estimated
in each generation. If this average similarity exceeds 90%, the mutation
probability is increased by a factor of (0.271/PS)/(MAXG), instead of
being reduced. When the average similarity of the chromosomes within
a population is over 90%, there is a high possibility that the proposed
algorithm has stacked in a local optimal solution.

experiments using the training set were conducted to optimize this

ation criterion was the convergence of the population. The population is
considered converged when the average ﬁtness across the current popu-
lation is <5% away from the best ﬁtness of the current population. The
maximum number of generations was set to 150 after observing that most
of the proposed algorithms executions were terminated in ~10(F120 gen-
erations when the convergence criterion was activated.
EnsembleGASVR is implemented in Matlab version R2011a, and all

EnsembleGASVR/dataset-codes.zip.

2.3 EnsembleGASVR

To alleviate the problem of missing values, to take advantage of our full
imbalanced dataset and to improve the overall classiﬁcation performance,
the aforementioned algorithm was extended to function as an ensemble
technique, named EnsembleGASVR. Ensemble methodologies (Rokach,
2009) are used to increase the effectiveness of individual classiﬁers and
maximize the performance by training multiple classiﬁers and combining
their decisions into a single output. The main proﬁt of ensemble meth-
odologies is the improvement of efﬁciency and accuracy: each classiﬁer
introduces errors, but the combination of different classiﬁers, as they
have been trained on different subsets of the original data, outperforms
a single classiﬁer (Kittler et al., 1998). The development of several clas-
siﬁers for each sub-training set is not affected by the heterogeneity of the
whole imbalanced training set in contrast to a single classiﬁer trained with
whole training examples (Chang, 2003). The problem of missing values is

also tackled effectively owing to the extraction of classiﬁer-speciﬁc fea-
tures subsets. The ﬁnal prediction of test samples takes into account only
those classiﬁers that do not have high percentage of missing variables in
their feature vector. In contrast to existing methodologies, which discard
data samples or use complicated imputation techniques, the aforemen-
tioned approach provides signiﬁcant computational savings, and offers
an elegant way of imputing missing values, without any loss of
information.

Taking advantage of the initial dataset for constructing more efﬁcient
classiﬁers, we divided randomly the initial dataset into two equal size sets
for training and testing, both containing 33 208 nsSNPs. The training set
was further partitioned randomly into n subsets of equal size. The
random partitioning procedure ensures that the ratio between positive
and negative samples was kept the same as in the original dataset.
A classiﬁer was trained for each training subset, applying the hybrid
training process described in the previous subsection. The number of
independent classiﬁers (n) was selected through an internal trial and
error procedure that attempted to use most of the available features
(>95% of them) in at least one classiﬁer, while maintaining a reasonable
sample size (>1000 samples for the minority class). In speciﬁc, the
number of the classiﬁers, starting with two independent classiﬁers, was
in each step increased by one until the above criteria are satisﬁed. This
fact enabled the proposed methodology to use most of the available in-
formation, extracting a set of diversiﬁed classifiers. The minimum
number of independent classiﬁers (n) that satisﬁed the above criteria
has been found equal to eight. The size of the training subset for this
setting (1109 pathogenic and 3042 neutral examples, respectively), which
was used to train every independent classiﬁer, was sufﬁcient to avoid the
problem of overﬁtting because of using small datasets (Lenth, 2001),
(Schaaf et al., 2012). The eight nu-SVR models were combined to form
an ensemble classiﬁcation model, which can be applied to predict the
pathogenicity of new and unseen nsSNPs. Regarding the testing process,
the new instances are classiﬁed by the eight nu-SVR models, and the
ensemble majority voting process is applied. A prediction value, a classi-
ﬁcation threshold and the feature subset used for classiﬁcation are re-
turned after the execution of each of the eight classiﬁers. However, if a
feature subset of a classiﬁer contains features with missing values, in a
percentage >7.5%, then the output of the classiﬁer is considered as low
conﬁdent and is not taken into account for the ﬁnal prediction (Fig. 1B).
The threshold for discarding a classiﬁcation model because of missing
values was optimized experimentally using only the training dataset. In
general, the proposed methodology uses models with a small percentage
of missing values. These missing values are calculated using the K-
Nearest Neighbor (KNN)-impute methodology (Troyanskaya et al.,
2001). Finally, an average prediction value and an average classiﬁcation
threshold are calculated based on the output of those classiﬁers that sat-
isfy the above criterion. If the average prediction value is higher than the
classiﬁcation threshold, EnsembleGASVR predicts nsSNP as pathogenic,
otherwise it predicts it as neutral. The way the eight individual models are
combined to classify a new nsSNP is summarized in Table 2.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Comparison with existing methods

The quality of EnsembleGASVR prediction was evaluated ac-
cording to seven metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, geo-
metric mean of sensitivity and speciﬁcity, Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC), precision and area under the curve (AUC). It
is evident that the values of sensitivity and speciﬁcity of a clas-
sifier depend on the speciﬁed classiﬁcation threshold between
neutral and pathogenic classes. In our case, the regression
nature of nu-SVR models enables EnsembleGASVR model to
be ﬂexible in terms of sensitivity and specificity. By changing the

classiﬁcation threshold, different rates between sensitivity and
speciﬁcity can be achieved. For the case of imbalance learning,
the geometric mean of sensitivity and speciﬁcity is the most
adequate metric to assess the performance of a classiﬁer
(Kubat and Matwin, 1997).

EnsembleGASVR was compared with the following four well-
known predictors of pathogenic nsSNPs: MutationAssessor,
Polyphen—2, PANTHER and SIFT. The main reason we chose
the aforementioned methods for our benchmarking, is that they
are widely used, frequently updated and also enable real-time
analysis of large lists of nsSNPs (Castellana and Mazza, 2013).
MutationAssessor computes a functional impact score and esti-
mates the effects of mutations using evolutionary conservation
criteria (Reva et al., 2011). This score derives from a set of evo-
lutionarily conserved residues that are computed by clustering
into subfamilies multiple alignments of homologous sequences.
Polyphen—2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010) uses a Naive Bayes classiﬁer
that has been trained using two different datasets (HumVar and
HumDiV) and it is up to users which of the two training sets will
be selected for the classiﬁcation. In this study, Polyphen—2’s per-
formance was evaluated, deploying both its alternative training
sets. SIFT uses a homology-based approach to predict whether
an amino acid substitution affects protein functionality and
alters the phenotype (Ng and Henikoff, 2001, 2002). SIFT

aligns a query protein with homologous sequences, using the
PSI-BLAST algorithm, and then it assigns a score in every resi-
due, according to the probability of the occurrence of the given
residue at the speciﬁc position in the alignment. Mutations in
highly conserved positions more likely lead to disease-associated
phenotypes, whereas mutations in not-conserved sites have neu-
tral effects. Similarly, PANTHER (Thomas et al., 2003) predicts
the impact of nsSNPs based on position-speciﬁc evolutionary
conservation scores, obtained from multiple sequence alignments
of related proteins. As evolutionary information was incorpo-
rated in our classiﬁcation, using features derived from the
PANTHER output, PANTHER method provides a baseline
measure for our benchmarking.

To present a fair comparison with respect to all the other
methods, we tested the performance on two independent data-
sets: (i) HumVar: containing 22196 deleterious and 21 119 neu-
tral mutations in 9679 human proteins. (ii) Independent test set
derived from our data collection: because our data collection is
large enough, we chose the simple hold-out approach to partition
the data randomly to completely independent training and test-
ing sets. Our final testing set contains 33 213 nsSNPs from 18 681
human proteins. The two different test sets share 16 798 common
nsSNPs, while the number of overlapping proteins is 6538. More
information about the overlap of the used independent test set
with the HumVar dataset are provided in the Supplementary
Table S5.

To assess the robustness of the proposed algorithm approach,
EnsembleGASVR was run 10 times, training 10 different models.
During the training procedure, the training set was partitioned
randomly into eight equal-size subsets. The average classiﬁcation
performance and the standard deviation of the trained models
are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

From the comparison, we excluded HumDiV dataset that con-
tains non-human mammalian homologs as negative sample. The
non-human HumDiV negative dataset has different characteris-
tics compared with the human ones, and the training and testing
of our method in such a dataset is out of the present article’s
scope. However, Polyphen-2’s latest version presented significant
advantages and reported high classiﬁcation performance on that
dataset.

Figures 2 and 3 present the receiver-operating characteristic
(ROC) curves analysis for both studied datasets. Extended ex-
perimental results are included in Supplementary Tables S3 and
S4 containing classiﬁcation performance of all the studied meth-
ods in HumDiV as well as the accuracy for the latest dbSNP
registry (build 139). Apparently, EnsembleGASVR outperforms
the other methods in accuracy, speciﬁcity, geometric mean, pre-
cision, MCC and AUC in both datasets. Polyphen-2, on the
other hand, achieves higher sensitivity in both datasets but
much lower performance in all other examined metrics. That
fact indicates that EnsembleGASVR tackles more effectively
the class imbalance problem. As it has already been mentioned,
the geometric mean gives better and more reliable insight on the
predictive power of a classiﬁer. One reason for this advantage of
our method is its ability to combine features disregarding of the
existence of mutual information among them. In opposite,
Polyphen is based on the Naive Bayes classiﬁer, which assumes
independence between the deployed features. Moreover, we ob-
serve that PANTHER and SIFT that rely on alignment with

homolog proteins achieve high speciﬁcity in both datasets but
much lower sensitivity. That fact can be attributed to the absence
of homologs in their libraries for all of the tested cases.

To verify the informative power of speciﬁc attributes, the fea-
ture subsets used by each individual classiﬁer were compared and
those that presented great discriminatory ability were identiﬁed.
Relative Solvent Accessibility, probability of wild-type residue in
PANTHER library (PM), message column of PANTHER output
and protein functional annotation, based on Gene Ontology
terms (Gene Ontology log-odds (LGO) score LGO), were used
by all the classiﬁers, and therefore, they present great discrimin-
atory ability. It is also noteworthy that the attribute (protein
essentiality) was included in six of the eight extracted feature
subsets. This observation denotes the discriminative ability of
this feature, highlights its effectiveness and recommends its
usage in the nsSNPs classiﬁcation problem. More details about
the selected features of each individual classiﬁer can be found in
Supplementary Table S2.

3.2 Exploring the value of the predicted score

It was mentioned previously that SVRs, when used for classiﬁ-
cation problems, support prediction with real value scores that
could be exploited as conﬁdence scores (extreme high and low
values indicate more reliable predictions and values near
zero represent uncertain predictions of low conﬁdence).
To validate this finding, we obtained the conﬁdence scores of
the EnsembleGASVR model that achieved the highest geometric
mean value in the training set, and we studied the top-107scored
predictions coming from our independent test set. We found that
all these predictions belong to the class of diseases-associated
nsSNPs, and all of them are reported in the dbSNP database.
The top-107scored mutations are presented in Table 5. From this
table, it is observed that all these mutations have been connected
with speciﬁc pathogenesis. A more detailed search in OMIM
database revealed that all of the top 10 predictions are associated
with rare single gene diseases and six of them belong to the class
of autosomal disorders. Moreover, 4 of the 10 mutated proteins
are expressed highly in Vital organs such as liver, brain and
colon. Regarding their functional effects, 50% is lethal and
death occurs in the early childhood. The rest cause severe
syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Xeroderma
pigmentosum, and in some cases the risk of developing cancer
is highly increased. These observations demonstrate that
EnsembleGASVR prediction scores are extremely effective in
measuring the conﬁdence of the derived predictions.

Then, as an alternative validation procedure, we studied
whether these predictions are associated with genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (GWAS) based on the latest catalog (https://www.
genome.gov/26525384). As the scope of this article is to study
nsSNPs, the GWAS SNPs were ﬁltered to keep only the non-
synonymous ones excluding the intergenic and intronic SNPs.
GWAS latest version (January 2014) includes 628 nsSNPs. The
whole batch of our predictions was scanned, and 198 matches
were found achieving a statistically signiﬁcant coverage of
31.52%.

Next, we investigated the possibility that the extracted conﬁ-
dence score could act as a metric for the severity of the poly-
morphism for the disease it causes. To achieve this, we used the

In particular, the pathogenic SNPs can be characterized as
Severe, Moderately Severe, Intermediate form, moderate, Mild
and Not Characterized. We intended to compare the 1000 high-
est scored pathogenic SNPs with the 1000 lowest scored patho-
genic diseases. However, only 49 among the highest scored and
58 SNPs among the lowest scored were actually characterized for
their severity. Because of the limited data samples, an additional
binning of characterization categories was required. The Severe,
Moderately Severe and Intermediate characterization categories
were combined to form the ﬁrst group, and the Mild and
Moderate characterizations formed the second one. The results
are presented in Table 6. Applying the Fisher’s Exact statistical
test, a statistical significant difference (P = 0.01611) was un-
covered between the two groups of mutations. Despite this
signiﬁcant finding, it is obvious that the limited total number

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

A novel computational framework was introduced for predicting
neutral and pathogenic polymorphic variations. The important
component of the proposed methodology is the utilization of a
two-phase algorithm that combines multiple nu—SVR classiﬁers
under the ensemble setting. The utilization of a GA optimizes the
ensemble framework parameters, the nu—SVR classiﬁer param-
eters and reveals compact feature subsets. Moreover, a problem-
speciﬁc scoring function was introduced that maximizes the
classiﬁcation performance and simultaneously produces inter-
pretable and relative simple classiﬁcation models. Although, all

these concepts are not new in the ﬁeld of pattern recognition, this
is the ﬁrst time they are deployed in one unified framework that
comfortably predicts nsSNPs and outperforms well-known exist-
ing methodologies. The performance superiority can be attribu-
ted to the ensemble nature of the method, which achieves high
classiﬁcation performance, rebalances the learning datasets,
ignores overﬁtting issues and presents great generalization cap-
abilities. In addition, the combination of decisions coming from
different classiﬁers provides an elegant way of manipulating
missing values without loss of information. Except for the prob-
lem of classifying missense SNPs, the proposed computational
technique is general enough and it can be applied to different
bioinformatics problem where the class imbalance and the
missing values problems are present. Besides, an extensive
study was performed for the most relevant features to the prob-
lem of classifying SNPs, and an 88-features superset was
proposed. This superset contains attributes, coming from several
categories, which capture all the adequate information of func-
tional proteins and can characterize efﬁciently pathogenic or
neutral variations. In contrast to the ad hoc selection of features,
the systemization of the feature selection process is a valuable
tool for linking speciﬁc protein characteristics with functionality

and pathogenicity. The embedded feature selection component
of EnsembleGASVR revealed a small feature subset, which is
stable, and always present in the ensemble models with 100%
frequency. This subset contains four features mostly related to
evolutionary and functional information. Furthermore, the new
feature that describes Vital properties was selected with 75%
frequency. Regarding the non-selected features, only two features
(whether the nsSNP occurs in the close environment of
T-phosphorylation site and whether the wild-type or mutant resi-
due is Valine) were not selected, and this could be attributed to
the mutual information shared by many of the examined
features. Another signiﬁcant contribution of this work is the
publication of a high-quality novel dataset. Moreover, the im-
plementation of the proposed methodology is publicly available
and can be run on commodity computers in a reasonable amount
of time. Nonetheless, there still is room for improvement. The
main drawback of EnsembleGASVR is the slow execution time
required for training (up to 24 h for an i5 processor workstation).
However, this is not a restricting factor for the application of the
trained model, as it requires only 15725 s to classify a single new
SNP. The high-computational cost of the training phase is attrib-
uted to the current implementation of the ensemble framework
and the GA implementation, which is sequential. However, the
ensemble nature of EnsembleGASVR and the evolutionary
properties of the GA optimizer are ideal for parallelization.
In our ongoing research, we are developing a master/slave pro-
gram that can run in multicore architectures and can take ad-
vantage of cloud-oriented infrastructures. Another limiting
factor is the lack of well-characterized non-damaging human
homologs datasets that can serve as negative examples.
Another interesting future idea is the prediction of disease-
related intronic and intergenic SNPs using GWAS data.
Regarding the biological part of this work, our future plan is
to study more extensively the linkage between the conﬁdence
scores of our predictor and the pathogenicity of SNPs. The
preliminary results for this task indicated that our predicted

confidence score is related to the severity of pathogenic SNPs. As
new data are made available through studies such as the GWAS,
this ﬁnding could be reinforced and new speciﬁc methods and
tools could be implemented for this purpose.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein—protein interaction (PPI) plays an important role in
understanding gene functions, and many computational PPI prediction
methods have been proposed in recent years. Despite the extensive
efforts, PPI prediction still has much room to improve. Sequence-
based co-evolution methods include the substitution rate method
and the mirror tree method, which compare sequence substitution
rates and topological similarity of phylogenetic trees, respectively.
Although they have been used to predict PPI in species with small
genomes like Escherichia coli, such methods have not been tested in
large scale proteome like Homo sapiens.

Result: In this study, we propose a novel sequence-based
co-evolution method, co-evolutionary divergence (CD), for human
PPI prediction. Built on the basic assumption that protein pairs with
similar substitution rates are likely to interact with each other, the CD
method converts the evolutionary information from 14 species of ver-
tebrates into likelihood ratios and combined them together to infer PPI.
We showed that the CD method outperformed the mirror tree method
in three independent human PPI datasets by a large margin. With the
arrival of more species genome information generated by next gener-
ation sequencing, the performance of the CD method can be further
improved.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteiniprotein interactions (PPI) regulate many fundamental
cellular processes (Alberts, 1998). One key step in understanding
the function of a protein is to identify its potential interacting
partners (Uetz, et al., 2000; Walhout and Vidal, 2001). PPI iden-
tification and prediction have become an important topic in
recent decades (Auerbach et al., 2002; Bader and Hogue, 2003;
Chen and Xu, 2003; Hart et al., 2006; Jansen, 2003; Ramani and
Marcotte, 2003; Rhodes et al., 2005; Scott and Barton, 2007; von
Mering et al., 2002).

Up to date, many experimental methods to identify physical
interaction between two proteins have been proposed, including
the yeast two-hybrid system (Ito et al., 2001), protein-fragment

complementation assay (Michnick et al., 2006), afﬁnity
puriﬁcation-mass spectrometry (Bauer and Kuster, 2003), pro-
tein microarray and ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer
(Werther et al., 2008). The results from these experiments have
been deposited in several public databases; for instance, HPRD
(Keshava Prasad et al., 2009), DIP (Salwinski et al., 2004),
IntAct (Aranda et al., 2010), BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006) and
MINT (Ceol et al., 2010). It has been suggested that there are
~300 000 PPI out of a total of ~300 000 000 protein pairs in the
human proteome (Hart et al., 2006). This estimate does not ac-
count for the numerous variations owing to post-translation
modiﬁcation or alternative splicing.

A number of computational techniques have been proposed to
provide either complementary information or supporting evi-
dence to experimental methods (Shoemaker and Panchenko,
2007); for example, phylogenetic proﬁle (Pellegrini et al., 1999),
Rosetta stone (Enright et al., 1999), conserved gene neighbor-
hood analyses (Dandekar et al., 1998), domain co-occurrence
(W uchty 2001; Wuchty and Almaas, 2005) and orthology infor-
mation (Izarzugaza et al., 2008; O’Brien et al., 2005). These
methods use domain, gene, functional pathway co-existence in-
formation or gene fusion event in related species to predict PPI.
Sequence-based co-evolution is another approach, which has
been proposed to predict PPI for many years. There are two
types of methods in this approach: the site-specific method and
the full-sequence method. The site-specific method detects se-
quence mutual changes in binding interfaces of interacting part-
ners to infer PPI (Chen and Jeong, 2009; Wass et al., 2011). But
changes in such regions are hard to detect (Lovell and
Robertson, 2010). Full-sequence methods, such as the
mirror-tree method proposed by Pazos (Pazos and Valencia,
2001), compare a distance matrix between two proteins and
use topological similarity of phylogenetic trees to predict PPI.
In addition, Fraser and his collaborates (Fraser et al., 2002)
compared substitution rates between two proteins and concluded
that interacting proteins evolve at a similar rate. However, both
methods have not been applied to the whole large-scale PPI pre-
diction in vertebrates.

In this article, we introduce a new method to exploit
sequence-based co-evolution for PPI prediction in the human
proteome. Our method is based on two basic assumptions.
First, shared selection pressure may force two interacting pro-
teins to co-evolve together. Changes in the sequence of one pro-
tein may induce appropriate changes in the sequence of its
interacting partner to retain the binding afﬁnity and maintain
biological functions. Consequently, PPI pairs may have similar
substitution rates. Second, protein interaction is more likely to

Human PPI prediction

 

conserve across related species. Thus, to study human proteins,
we shall examine their orthologous proteins in all vertebrates
whose genomes are already sequenced. Based on these two as-
sumptions, we deﬁne the co-evolutionary divergence (CD) of a
pair of proteins as the absolute value of the substitution rate
difference between two proteins. The CD values of interacting
protein pairs are expected to be smaller than those of non-
interacting protein pairs. Therefore, we may use CD as a feature
to distinguish interacting protein pairs from non-interacting pro-
tein pairs. We evaluate the performance of PPI prediction by the
CD method and compare it with the mirror tree method. By
examining three independent PPI datasets, we show that CD is
a better method for human PPI prediction.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein sequence and protein interaction dataset

In all, 16229 proteins of Homo sapiens and their orthologous protein
sequences in 13 vertebrates, Cam's lupus (dog), Bos taurus (cow), Equus
caballus (horse), Gallus gallus (chicken), M acaca mulatta (macaques), Pan
troglodytes (chimpanzees), Mus musculus (mice), Rattus norvegicus (rat),
Monodelphis domestica (opossums), Oryzias latipes (medaka), Takifugu
pardalis (fugu), Danio rerio (zebraﬁsh) and Tetraodon nigroviridis, total-
ing 172338 protein sequences, were obtained from Evola database
(Matsuya et al., 2008).

A protein interaction dataset was downloaded from the Human
Protein Reference Database (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009). Duplicate
interactions and self-interactions were removed, resulting in 36 867 dis-
tinct human protein interactions for 8694 distinct human proteins. These
interactions formed the golden standard positive dataset (GSP). The
golden standard negative dataset (GSN) consisted of 2750 990 protein
pairs with one protein from the plasma membrane cellular component
and the other from the nuclear cellular component. GSP and GSN were
taken as our training dataset to construct the likelihood ratio table.
Among 16 229 orthologous proteins, only 4116 orthologous proteins
appear in all 14 vertebrates. Thus, only 3781 protein pairs of GSP and
160160 protein pairs of GSN from HPRD database were used when
comparing the CD method and the mirror tree method. This is because
mirror tree method requires all orthologous proteins be in all species
under consideration.

Our ﬁrst independent test used the interacting protein dataset from
GRID (Stark et al., 2006). This dataset has 1497 interacting protein pairs
with orthologous proteins in all 14 species. There are no overlapping pairs
between this test dataset and the training dataset. Our second independ-
ent test dataset came from the protein complex database of CORUM
(Ruepp et al., 2010). There are 1846 protein complexes in this database.
Complexes containing unspeciﬁc proteins, e.g. isoforms or splice variants
whose sequences could not be speciﬁcally identified are eliminated. All
proteins in the same complex are treated as having interaction with each
other. There are 2738 distinct interacting protein pairs in our second
testing dataset, and there are 389 distinct interacting protein pairs if we
restrict protein complexes to sizes between 20 and 40 proteins.

2.2 Protein substitution rate estimation and CD of
interacting protein pair

Pair-wise alignment of 172 338 orthologous proteins was made with soft-
ware ClustalW2. For each protein with orthologs in 11 species, there are
n(n — 1)/2 pair-wise alignments. The number of amino acid substitutions
per site, (1, was used as substitution rate of protein. It was estimated by
numerically solving the equation, q = [ln(1 + 2 d)/2 d], where q is the frac-
tion of identical residues between two aligned sequences made by pairwise

alignment (Grishin, 1995). More speciﬁcally, the pair-wise alignment by
ClustalW outputs a conserved region of the sequence containing sites of
‘identical’, ‘conserved substitution’ and ‘semi-oonserved substitution’.
‘Identical’ means the amino acids of the two orthologous sequences at
the site are identical. ‘Conserved substitution’ means the replacement of
an amino acid residue by another one with similar properties, such as
aspartate for glutamate. A semi-conserved amino acid replaces one resi-
due with another one that has similar steric conformation, but does not
share chemical properties. The value q is the fraction of identical amino
acids in the conserved region. We use the absolute value of substitution
rate difference between two proteins to measure the CD of interacting
protein pair. The CD values of 36 867 protein pairs in GSP and 2 750 990
protein pairs in GSN were calculated. We used them to construct the
likelihood ratio table of interacting protein pairs.

2.3 Likelihood ratio table construction of CD features

The CD values of 2750 990 protein pairs in GSN were grouped into 10
bins of increasing substitution rate difference according to their quantiles
(Supplementary Table Sl). To calculate the likelihood ratio of protein
interaction for a given bin, we divided the proportion of protein pairs of
GSP with their CD values in the bin by the proportion of protein pairs of
GSN with their CD values in the same bin. This yielded 91 CD likelihood
ratios for describing the possibility of interaction for a protein pair
(Supplementary Table S2).

2.4 The naive Bayes classiﬁer

A nai've Bayes approach was used to combine the 91 individual likelihood
ratios. The proportion of positive cases (P(pos)) and the proportion of
negative cases (P(neg): 1 — P(pos)) were used as the prior distribution.
The ‘posterior’ odds after observing N features for prediction, f 1, . . . ,fN,
is P(pos | f1, . . . ,fN) / P(neg | f1, . . . ,fN). The likelihood ratio L deﬁned as
L(f1,...,fN)=P(fl,...,fN | pos) / P(f1,...,fN | neg) relates the prior
odds and posterior odds according to Bayes’s rule. The naive Bayes clas-
siﬁer assumes the conditional independence of N features to simplify the
likelihood estimation. The likelihood L is simply the product of the N
individual likelihood ratios obtained by considering each feature separ-
ately. This assumption is rarely true in most real world problems.
However, if the dependence pattern of the joint density of N features
under the positive set is similar to that under the negative set, then by
cancelation, the true likelihood ratio will be approximately the same as
the one calculated under the independence assumption. In Supplementary
Figure S], we compared each likelihood ratio for the pair-wise density
conditional on the positive set over that conditional on the negative set.
We showed that they were indeed very close to each other. Thus, in our
application, the naive Bayes classiﬁer serves as a reasonable approxima-
tion to the optimal Bayes classiﬁer.

2.5 Integration of 91 CD features to form the joint CD
score by na'ive Bayes

There were four steps involved. Given a protein pair, we first computed
the CD value for each of the 91 combinations between 14 species. Then
we used the 10-quantile (decile) table of CD distribution for GSN
(Supplementary Table Sl) to identify at which decile interval each of
the 91CD values was located. The third step is to obtain the 91 likelihood
ratios from the likelihood ratio table (Supplementary Table S2). If ortho-
logous proteins were not present in a pair of species, we set the corres-
ponding likelihood ratio to be 1. The ﬁnal likelihood ratio, which we
called the joint CD score, of each protein pairs was calculated by multi-
plying the 91 likelihood ratios. For example, if the CD of a protein pair is
0.02 between human and mouse, this value is between 10 and 20%, ac-
cording to Supplementary Table S]. We could obtain the corresponding
likelihood ratio is 1.4907 in Supplementary Table S2. Repeat the same

operation to obtain the other 90 CD values. Then we multiply all 91
likelihood ratio values to get the ﬁnal score.

2.6 Mirror tree method: co-evolutionary constraint

The multiple alignment and the distance matrix for constructing phylo-
genetic tree of each orthologous protein were constructed by ClustalW.
The distance matrix was transformed into a vector for easier formulation.
The upper or lower half of the non-diagonal elements of the distance
matrix was arranged as an array of the numerical values in certain
order. When the distance matrix has a size of n x n, the dimension of
the vector is n(n — 1)/2. The vector is hereafter referred to as a ‘phylo-
genetic vector’. In this study, 11 is equal to 14. Therefore, the dimension of
the phylogenetic vector is 91. The intensity of the co-evolutionary con-
straint between proteins A and B is evaluated by Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient between phylogenetic vectors of A and B.

2.7 Accuracy measurement and receiver operating
characteristic curve comparison

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to plot the
fraction of true positives out of the positives (P) versus the fraction of
false positives out of the negatives (N). The area under the receiver oper-
ating characteristic (AUROC) is a common summary statistic for the
accuracy of a predictor in a binary classiﬁcation task. Comparison of
area under two ROC curves was made with ‘pROC’ package of R lan-

guage (Robin et al., 2011) using DeLong’s non-parametric approach
(DeLong et al., 1988).

2.8 Null distribution of AUROC of the CD method

To obtain the null distribution of AUROC for the CD method, we ran-
domly selected 30 774 protein pairs without self-interaction from all pos-
sible protein pairs, to form a null positive dataset. We used the 2750 338
protein pairs in GSN as the negative dataset. We then calculated the
AUROC value for this simulated null positive dataset versus the negative
dataset. We repeated this process 1000 times to obtain the null distribu-
tion of AUROC. The result was shown in Figure 5b.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Protein substitution rate

The orthology relationships of proteins between human and 13
species were extracted from an ortholog information database:
EVOLA (Matsuya et al., 2008). The number of orthologous pro-
tein sequences between human and each species was shown in
Figure 1. Chimpanzee has the largest number of human ortho-
logs, whereas the numbers for chicken, medaka, tetradon, fugu
and zebra ﬁsh are considerably lower than others. The distribu-
tion of protein substitution rate between human and other spe-
cies was given in Figure 2. Chimpanzee and macaque showed the
lowest average substitution rates, whereas chicken, medaka, tet-
radon, fugu, and zebra ﬁsh showed much higher rates.

3.2 Signiﬁcant negative correlations between substitution
rate and number of interacting partners in vertebrates

The negative correlation between substitution rate and the
number of interacting partners of a protein was ﬁrst reported
in a study comparing Saccharomyces cerevisiae with Caenorhab—
ditis elegans. (Fraser et al., 2002) We investigated whether the
same relationship still holds in vertebrates. We computed the
Spearman correlation for each of the 91 combinations between

14 species. Remarkably, all of these correlations indeed turned
out negative (Supplementary Table S3).

3.3 CD increases from chimpanzee to zebra ﬁsh

The CDs of interacting protein pairs between human and each of
the other 13 vertebrates were computed. Figure 3a summarized
the CD distribution for each humanivertebrate species pair. We
found that the values increase from chimpanzee to zebra ﬁsh, in
the same order as Figure 2. However, the distribution for
non-interacting protein pairs (Fig. 3b) also showed the same pat-
tern. This indicates the lack of power in using each CD feature
separately for differentiating the interacting pairs from
non-interacting pairs. We overcome the difﬁculty by combining
all available CD features into a likelihood ratio.

3.4 CD score in gold standard positive dataset is
signiﬁcantly smaller than those in gold standard
negative dataset

The joint CD score was computed for each protein pair in both
GSP dataset and GSN dataset. In all, 6123 protein pairs in GSP
and 652 protein pairs in GSN were eliminated because we could
not find othologous protein pairs for them in any two species.
This resulted in 30 744 protein pairs from the GSP dataset and
2705 338 protein pairs from the GSN dataset. Figure 4 plotted
the two distributions of joint CD scores. The Kolmogorovi
Smirnov test was applied to test whether these two distributions
were the same. We found the difference to be highly signiﬁcant,
and the distribution from gold standard positive is stochastically
greater than that from gold standard negative. The accuracy of
predicting PPI by joint CD scores, measured by the AUROC is
0.639 (Fig. 5a). This value is much larger than the AUROC
values obtained from randomly generated null selected positive
datasets, which fall between 0.510 and 0.530 based on 1000 simu-
lations (Fig. 5b).

3.5 Comparison of the CD method and the mirror tree
method

We compare the CD method and the mirror tree method. The
mirror tree method requires that orthologous proteins must be
present in all 14 species. Thus, both the positive set and the
negative set used for comparison are subject to this constraint.

We ﬁrst evaluated the performance on the HPRD dataset.
Only 3781 interacting protein pairs with orthologous protein in
all 14 species from GSP were used to compute the AUROC value
for the CD method and that for the mirror tree method, respect-
ively. The CD method had an AUROC value of 0.6078, signiﬁ-
cantly (P< 2.2E716) better than the AUROC value of 0.4352 for
the mirror tree methods, Figure 6a.

As an independent testing dataset, we used 1497 interacting
protein pairs from BIOGRID database. These pairs had no over-
lap with any of the 36867 pairs in GSP. In this independent
testing dataset, the CD method had an AUROC value of
0.6285, significantly (P<2.2E716) better than the AUROC
value of 0.4415 for the mirror tree methods, Figure 6b.

The mirror tree method has been applied to predict PPI with
protein pairs from known protein complexes Wang et al., 2010).
To see whether this method may work better than ours on

protein complexes, our second independent testing dataset used
protein complexes from CORUM as the positive PPI dataset.
We found that the AUROC value of 0.714 for the CD method
was still signiﬁcantly (P<2.2 E—16) better than the AUROC
value of 0.459 for the mirror tree method (Fig. 6c). The perform-
ance of mirror tree method is surprisingly low, although this
method showed a good performance when applying to mito-
chondria respiratory chain proteins Wang et £11., 2010). We
also made another comparison by restricting protein complexes
to sizes between 20 and 40 proteins. The result was similar. The
AUROC values of our method and the mirror tree method were
0.783 and 0.426, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.6 Protein pairs with high joint CD scores are likely to be
functionally associated

We computed the joint CD score for each gene pair across the
entire human genome and ranked all of the 131 682106 pairs by
their scores. Scanning the list from the top, we found that the
highest score (=6.8778E+13) was obtained by 46 gene pairs
(Supplementary Table S4a, rows 2—47). Several genes appeared
multiple times in these pairs. The most visible one is a cluster of
six subunits of the ribosomal protein complex (RPL27, RPL30,
RPS14, RPS15A and RPS28), which appeared 23 times in total.
In addition, there were proteasome subunits (PSMA4, PSMD7

and PSMD12) and DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit
(POLR2C, POLR2H). It is also noteworthy to point out three
genes involved in the histone modiﬁcation, HDAC3 (histone
deacetylase 3), RUVBLl (Component of the NuA4 histone acet-
yltransferase complex) and RUNXlTl (runt-related transcrip-
tion factor 1; a gene well-known for the highly-frequent
t(8;2l)(q22,q22) translocation in acute myeloid leukemia). The
proteiniprotein binding between RUNXlTl and HDAC3 has
been reported in the literature (Amann et al., 2001). The CD
score for this pair is remarkably high, ranking at the 154th
place from the top. On the other hand, the alternation between
histone deacetylation and histone acetylation underlines the dy-
namical change of chromatin structure, which is critical for

regulating gene expression and other important nucleus biolo-
gical events. Reaching the highest CD score by RUNBLl and
HDAC3 as well as RUNBLl and RUNXlTl reﬂects very well
the importance of the co—evolution for genes that participate in
two associated biological processes.

We set a score threshold of 10E+ 13 to investigate the func-
tional sharing tendency between paired genes with high CD
score. In all, 11389 pairs involving 743 proteins scored higher
than the threshold; see Supplementary Table S4 for the full list.
The GO term system (http://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/
GOTermMapper) was used to assign biological functions. By
comparing with genes paired at random, our data showed an
enrichment of GO term sharing for high CD score gene pairs;
see Supplementary Figure S3. We concluded that the CD method
is useful for inferring the functional association between genes.

4 DISCUSSION

Our CD method used the sequence-based co-evolution approach
for PPI prediction. Although this method could rank the likeli-
hood of interaction for a given pair of proteins, it did not infer
speciﬁc features of interaction such as the interacting residues in
the interfaces. Structure-based methods such as protein or
domain docking methods emphasize the molecular interface
between proteins or domains (Gray et al., 2003; Heifetz et al.,
2002; Madaoui and Guerois, 2008; Norel et al., 2001). However,
the computing load of docking methods is too heavy to be
applied for the large scale prediction in human genome. The
CD method might provide a shorter list of candidate protein
pairs for applying these methods.

One class of co-evolutionary models exploiting sequence co-
variations were used to predict interaction between residues
within a protein sequence. For example, statistical coupling ana-
lysis (SCA) and mutual information successfully infer residues
interactions in PDZ protein family and basic helix-loop—helix
transcription factor, respectively (Atchley et al., 2000; Lockless
and Ranganathan, 1999). The assumptions of these two methods
are similar to the CD method: if one protein interacts with the
other protein in human, their orthologous proteins in other spe-
cies are likely to have interactions too. The main difference is

that methods like SCA focus on the co-change between amino
acids, whereas the CD method focuses on the rates of amino acid
change between two sequences. Although methods like SCA pro-
vide computational methods to infer the residues interactions
within protein sequence, they may be extended to infer residues
interactions between protein sequences.

We demonstrated that our CD method performed much better
than the mirror tree method in three independent datasets of
interacting proteins in human. One major difference between
the two methods is that the CD method is more sensitive to
the absolute size difference of protein substitution rates.
Because the mirror tree uses the correlation coefﬁcient of the
sequence substitution rate profiles across the selected species, it
is only the relative size difference in the substitution rates that
matters. Therefore, two protein families may have considerably
different substitution rates across all branches of the evolution
tree, whereas their proﬁles may still have high correlations. In
such cases, they may not form proteiniprotein interactions, but
are likely to be falsely predicted by the mirror tree method. The
other difference is the alignment method used in comparing
othologs. In the mirror tree method, the conserved regions iden-
tiﬁed by multiple alignment across all related species are used to
generate the evolutionary proﬁle for correlation analysis. The
size of a conserved region would automatically get smaller
when more species are used for alignment. This leads to the un-
fortunate consequence that less information could be used in
estimating the rate of substitution between species. In the CD
method, the conserved regions are identiﬁed separately by the
pair-wise alignment for each species pair. The region sizes are
larger, and the substitution rate estimation is more informative.

The negative correlation between protein substitution rate and
number of interacting partner may be a potential source of false
negatives in the CD method. Proteins with many interacting
partners (hub protein) tend to have lower substitution rates. If
a protein only interacts with one such hub protein and has no
other interacting partner, its substitution rate may be higher. As
a consequence, the CD of such protein pairs may have an
upward bias. To investigate whether the bias is substantial, we
compare the distribution of CD between PPI involving with hub
proteins and not involving with hub proteins (Supplementary

Figs S4 and S5). Although the CD of PPI involved with one
hub protein is slightly greater than that of PPI not involving
with any hub protein, the difference is not significant.

Our CD method used all 91 comparisons between pairs of 14
vertebrates. For human PPI prediction, an alternative version
would be to construct the likelihood ratio from only the 13 com-
parisons involving human and other vertebrates. However, this
did not yield a better performance (Supplementary Fig. S6). We
also investigated the effect of bin size choice in constructing the
likelihood ratio table. As shown in Supplementary Figure S7, the
performance of our method is nearly unchanged when changing
the bin size from 10% t0 5%.

We conclude that the CD method may be a more direct way to
combine co-evolutionary information of inter-acting protein pair
from many species. The co-evolutionary diver-gence method
does not use multiple alignment, thus taking less time than the
mirror tree method. The mirror tree method is limited to those
proteins with orthologous across all species under consideration.
Thus, when more and more species genomes become available,
less proteins could be applied. In contrast, increasing the number
of species will provide more information to improve the accuracy
of the co-evolutionary divergence method.

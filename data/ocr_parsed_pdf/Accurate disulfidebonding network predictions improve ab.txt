Abstract

Motivation: Cysteine—rich proteins cover many important families in nature but there are currently
no methods specifically designed for modeling the structure of these proteins. The accuracy of di—
sulfide connectivity pattern prediction, particularly for the proteins of higher—order connections,
e.g. >3 bonds, is too low to effectively assist structure assembly simulations.

Results: We propose a new hierarchical order reduction protocol called Cyscon for disulfide—
bonding prediction. The most confident disulfide bonds are first identified and bonding prediction
is then focused on the remaining cysteine residues based on SVR training. Compared with purely
machine learning—based approaches, Cyscon improved the average accuracy of connectivity
pattern prediction by 21.9%. For proteins with more than 5 disulfide bonds, Cyscon improved the
accuracy by 585% on the benchmark set of PDBCYS. When applied to 158 non—redundant cysteine—
rich proteins, Cyscon predictions helped increase (or decrease) the TM—score (or RMSD) of the
ab initio QUARK modeling by 12.1% (or 14.4%). This result demonstrates a new avenue to improve
the ab initio structure modeling for cysteine—rich proteins.

grouped into template—based and template—free (0r ab initio) model—
ing (Zhang, 2008). Since the topology of the protein structure can
be decided by the contact maps, many efforts have been dedicated to
predicting residue—residue contacts. In the template—based modeling

Structure Prediction) experiment, the modeling of several New Fold
targets reached an unprecedented resolution due to the successful in—
tegration of the ab initio contact predictions (Grishin, 2014).
However, except for the targets that have a high number of homolo—
gous sequences which can be used for detecting the conserved muta—
tions and contacts, the accuracy of ab initio contact predictions is in
general too low to be useful for 3D structure determination (Wu
et (11., 2011). One feasible improvement is to decompose the contact
map into different types of contacts that can be predicted more reli—
ably, such as disulfide bonds.

Disulfide bonds are formed between cysteine residues, which are
the only coded amino acids that have a reactive sulfhydryl group.
This type of residue interaction can be formed between residues
from either the same or different polypeptide chains, which usually
induces long—range contacts along the protein sequence (Gromiha
and Selvaraj, 1997). It has been widely acknowledged that the long—
range contacts are crucial to protein structure modeling because
they constrain the possible conformations and reduce the entropy of
unfolded states (Harrison and Sternberg, 1994; Wu and Zhang,
2008). Thus, accurate prediction of the disulfide—bonding network
should improve ab initio protein structure prediction (Chuang et (11.,
2003; Gupta et (11., 2004).

Disulfide bonds are important for protein function and structural
stability. For instance, the formation of disulfide bonds is a key post—
translational modification in numerous proteins (Winther and
Thorpe, 2014). In dual oxidase proteins, disulfide bonds contribute
importantly to protein—protein interactions (Meitzler et (11., 2013).
Previous studies have revealed that incorrectly formed disulfide
bonds can be deleterious to both the function and stability of some
proteins (Cloos and Christgau, 2002; Kénesi et (11., 2003).

Due to the importance of disulfide bonds in both protein struc—
tural and functional studies, many computational methods have
been developed for predicting their connectivity patterns from pro—
tein sequence, with the aim to identify the correct bonding of oxi—
dized cysteine residues. This problem was first addressed via
maximum weight perfect matching (Fariselli and Casadio, 2001),
where the weight of each edge is equivalent to the contact potential
between the two cysteine residues, which was derived by Monte—
Carlo simulated annealing. Following this work, considerable efforts
were devoted to machine learning—based ab initio approaches to pre—
dict the contact potential for improving the performance. Progress
in this regard focuses on two directions:

i. Developing more powerful prediction algorithms: e.g. neural
network (NN) (Fariselli et (11., 2002), support vector machine
(SVM) (Chen et (11., 2006), kernel method (Vincent et (11., 2008),
correlated mutation analysis (Raimondi et (11., 2015; Rubinstein
and Fiser, 2008) and support vector regression (SVR) (Savojardo
et (11., 2011, 2013; Song et (11., 2007);

ii. Introducing novel feature representations: besides traditional
global and local sequence—derived features, recent studies have
shown that some features such as protein subcellular localization
(Savojardo et (11., 2011), correlated mutations (Savojardo et (11.,
2013) and context—based features (Yaseen and Li, 2013) can also
improve the performance. In addition, feature selection methods
such as Fisher score (Zhu et (11., 2010) were proposed to over—
come the high—dimensional problems and improve the
prediction.

Different from the above ab im'to approaches which perform pre—
dictions by only using the amino acid sequence information, the
other trend is using the homology modeling techniques, where some
prediction features are extracted from the modeled structures. For

instance, the spatial distance between the cysteine residues in the
modeled structure can be used as an encoding feature (Yu et (11.,
2015). Other studies in this trend include: Lin and Tseng (2010) and
O’Connor and Yeates (2004). Despite this type of methods is prom—
ising considering the rapid increase of the deposited 3D structures in
PDB, which may increase the possibility of finding good templates,
they may still fail for large portion of proteins, which cannot find
good templates in current PDB.

This study aims to further enhancing the disulfide bonds predic—
tion by using only the amino acid sequence information. Although
existing methods can predict disulfide connectivity patterns with
reasonable accuracy, there are still challenging problems that ser—
iously limit the prediction performance. One of the biggest chal—
lenges is the high order problem: sequences with more disulfide
bonds are much more difficult to predict accurately than those with
fewer bonds. In fact, the entire pattern prediction accuracy will be
very low for sequences with more than five bonds. The reason is
that a disulfide connectivity pattern represents a unique correct com—
bination of all the disulfide bonds in the sequence, and it is correct
only if all the independent bonds are correctly predicted. For a se—
quence with 5 bonds, there will be 945 different bond combinations
(c.f. Equation 4), where only 1 arrangement is correct and the ran—
dom prediction success rate is ~0.1%. The situation will be even
worse for many cysteine—rich proteins, which often contain more
than five disulfide bonds.

To this end, we propose a new algorithmic improvement based
on the idea of order reduction by first finding the most confident di—
sulfide bonds. For example, if we can determine 1 confident bond
from a query sequence of high order (e.g. 5 bonds), then the problem
is reduced to finding the correct combination among 4 remaining
bonds, which has only 105 candidate patterns, much less than the
original 945. It is fulfilled by an effective confident bond detector
based on the observation that some disulfide bonds are found
aligned at the same positions in the multiple sequence alignments
(MSA). The detected confident bonds will be eliminated from the
following decision process to reduce the complexity. Then, a max—
imum weight graph matching approach will be used to determine
the remaining bonds, where the weights are predicted using a statis—
tical machine learning predictor. Our hierarchical system for pre—
dicting disulfide connectivity patterns is called Cysteine contact
(Cyscon). The new order reduction characteristic enables Cyscon to
achieve higher prediction accuracy than traditional approaches.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Datasets

For a fair comparison of the performance, we employed the two
benchmark datasets that have been used in previous studies, i.e.
SPX dataset (Cheng et (11., 2006) and PDBCYS dataset (Savojardo
et (11., 2011). The first dataset is used to evaluate our proposed
method, and the second is used for comparing with other existing
methods. In these two datasets, only intra—chain disulfide bonds
are presented and the disulfide bond information is derived from
SSBOND records in the PDB files. Each dataset is described in de—
tail below.

2.1.1 SPX dataset

This dataset was taken from DIpro (Cheng et (11., 2006), which in—
cludes 1018 protein sequences that were collected from the PDB.
These sequences have at least 1 intra—chain disulfide bond. We eval—
uated our method on the SPX dataset using 10—fold cross—validation,

where the 10—folds were downloaded from http://dislocate.biocomp.
unibo.it/dislocate/. We only selected chains containing at least 2 and
at most 5 disulfide bonds from the original dataset for model train—
ing, resulting in 428 protein sequences, where the pairwise sequence
identity is below 25 %. Besides, 36 chains with more than 5 disulfide
bonds were selected for an independent test of high order proteins.

2.1.2 PDBCYS dataset

In order to compare with the recent state—of—the—art methods, we as—
sessed our method on the PDBCYS dataset using the same 20—fold
cross—validation as DISLOCATE (Savojardo et (11., 2011). This data—
set is homology reduced at the 25% sequence identity level, which
contains 1797 protein sequences. In the PDBCYS dataset, 458 se—
quences have at least 1 intra—chain disulfide bond. Similar to previ—
ous studies, chains with at least 2 and at most 5 disulfide bonds
were picked from the original dataset, which resulting in 263 protein
sequences for cross—validation. Additionally, 51 chains with more
than 5 disulfide bonds were selected for an extra independent test.
Supplementary Table S1 shows the detailed information of the two
datasets.

2.2 System architecture

Cyscon predicts the disulfide bonds directly from amino acid se—
quence and is a hierarchical two—stage approach that integrates the
machine learning—based predictions with the predictions from the se—
quence alignment—based confident bond detector (Fig. 1). Given a
protein sequence, before the prediction of disulfide bond locations,
we need to know the bonding states of each cysteine residue. The
reason is that although disulfide bonds are only formed between
cysteine residues, not necessarily every cysteine will be involved.
Due to predicting whether a cysteine residue will be bonded or not
can be transformed into a two—class classification problem and its
accuracy is already very high (Chen et (11., 2004), we assume that the
bonding states of cysteine residues are known as the prior know—
ledge, which is the same as other previous studies (Rubinstein and
Fiser, 2008; Song et (11., 2007). In Cyscon, the confident bond de—
tector assigns the most reliable disulfide bonds to the test sequence
in the first stage, which will be eliminated from the undirected
weighted graph for final decision. In the second stage, the sequential
features of the oxidized cysteine residues are extracted and com—
bined, and then fed into an SVR model to obtain the initial probabil—
ities of cysteine pairs forming disulfide bonds. The first step can
effectively reduce the decision complexity and hence is helpful for
improving the predictor’s performance.

2.3 Feature extraction

Feature representation is critical in machine learning—based applica—
tions. In this work, we extracted four types of discriminative features
to encode cysteine residues, which are all extracted directly from the
amino acid sequence. The features are described in detail as follows.

2.3.1 Position specific scoring matrix (PSSM)

The evolutionary information in PSSM was proven to be effective in
previous studies (Savojardo et (11., 2011; Song et (11., 2007). In this
work, it was generated by running PSI—BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1997)
to search against the UniRef90 database with three iterations and an
E—value threshold of 0.001. Each oxidized cysteine residue was rep—
resented as a vector of 20 elements that indicates the probabilities of
20 amino acids occurring at that position. A local window of size 13
was used to include the neighboring information, thus, we encoded
the PSSM feature with a 13 X 20 : 260—D vector. The original score
in each position was normalized by the following logistic function:

1

“92m

(1)

where x is the original score.

2.3.2 Predicted secondary structure (PSS)

The predicted secondary structure was also used to encode each
cysteine residue by using PSIPRED (Jones, 1999), which outputs the
propensities for the three secondary structure states (helix, strand
and coil). To consider neighboring structural information, we
encoded the PSS feature with a 13 X 3 : 39—D vector.

2.3.3 Correlated mutation (CM)

Since the disulfide bond is a well—defined residue—residue contact, it
is expected to result in covariation between the two sequence pos—
itions. To reduce calculation bias, we used two different algorithms
to calculate the residue correlated mutation features, which will gen—
erate two feature scores. The first scoring scheme is the same as
(Rubinstein and Fiser, 2008). Based on the MSA obtained through
searching the query sequence against the UniRef90 database, the
first CM value was calculated as:

1/(ICkI-1). MEC
CMWJ) : 1/(INCkI — 1)) 13/6 NC (2)
0, other

where the function In) is the size of the set. For each valid sequence [2
in the alignment, positions were divided into two sets based on
amino acid type. The set C contains the positions of the cysteine resi—
dues while the set NC contains the positions of the other residues.
The CM score between positions 1' and j is a mean value and was
computed by averaging over all the sequences in the alignment,
which lies in the range of [0, 1]. Note that if two positions are in dif—
ferent sets, the CM score is set to 0. The second CM score was ex—
tracted from GREMLIN (Kamisetty et (11., 2013) outputs, which is a
pseudo—likelihood approach for residue contact prediction via fewer
homologous sequences. The larger the CM score is, the higher po—
tential the cysteine pair forms a disulfide bond.

2.3.4 Cysteine separation distance (CSD)
This feature encodes the sequence distance between two oxidized
cysteine residues. CSD is defined by:

CSDUJ) =10g(Ii-il) (3)

91oz ‘Og JSanV uo salaﬁuv soc] ‘BtHJOJtIBQ JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /3.10'speumo[p1q1xo"sotJBuiJOJutotq/ﬁduq 11101} popcolumoq

3776

J. Yang et al.

 

where i and / represent the positions of the two oxidized cysteine
residues along the query sequence that potentially form a disulfide
bond. As shown in (Tsai et (11., 2005 ), scaling the sequence distance
value by the logarithm function works better than other scaling
methods in terms of the accuracy of the final prediction.

In summary, according to the PSSM and P55 features, when the
local window size is 13, we can get a vector of 13 X
(20 + 3) X 2 : 598 components for each cysteine pair. Together with
the CM (2D) and CSD (1D) features, we can then obtain a 601—D
vector to encode one cysteine pair. We applied 8—insensitive support
vector regression (8—SVR), a module from the SVMlight (Joachims,
2002) software package to build the machine learning model using
the radial basis function kernel (RBF) with 8 : 0.01. The parameters
y and C were optimized by combining a grid search with cross—
validation.

2.4 Confident bond detector

Based on the findings that sequences with similar cysteine separation
profiles may have similar disulfide connectivity patterns (Zhao
et (11., 2005) and disulfide bonds are often highly conserved
(Perlman et (11., 1995), we built an effective confident bond detector
engine. Given a protein sequence, we first used HHblits (Remmert
et (11., 2012) to search against the bundled UniProt20 database with
three iterations to generate MSA. And then, we used HHsearch
(Soding, 2005) to search against a database of profile hidden
Markov models (HMMs), where the database was annotated with
the known disulfide connectivity patterns. Lastly, we aligned the
query sequence against the searched best sequence. Labeled disulfide
bonds from the best aligned sequence are then assigned to the query
sequence if the corresponding aligned positions on the query se—
quence are both cysteines. Our results show that disulfide bonds de—
tected through this alignment—annotation approach have a high
success rate and hence can be regarded as confident edges and then
eliminated from the next—step of the decision process. This will help
to reduce the decision order. Figure 2 illustrates the process of the
confident bond detector. In the case of k—fold cross—validation, the
annotated database is composed by the other k—1 training folds.

2.5 Maximum weight graph matching
Suppose that there exists B disulfide bonds in a protein sequence,
then it will have ZB oxidized cysteine residues. The number of pos—
sible disulfide connectivity patterns N will be:

3 (Mn

N: w—n:
E M?

 

(4)

As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, the number of disulfide con—
nectivity patterns increases exponentially with the number of disul—
fide bonds. The problem to be solved is to find the unique correct
connectivity pattern from all the possible solutions. It can be trans—
formed to the problem of maximum weight graph matching for an
undirected weighted graph G, which contains 23 nodes and
23(23 — 1)/2 edges. The weight of each edge indicates the probabil—
ity of the cysteine pair forming a disulfide bond. Then, our aim is to
find the maximum weight matching corresponding to the disulfide
connectivity pattern, where each node is uniquely connected with
another node. Obviously, the larger B is, the more difficult it is to
find a correct matching due to noise in the edge weights and the de—
cision complexity.

In Cyscon, we used the above confident bond detector to first
determine the confident bonds, which will be eliminated from
the undirected weighted graph. This will reduce the graph size.

Fig. 2. Flow chart of sequence alignment-based confident bond detector. By
searching the query sequence against an annotated database of disulfide
bonds, a confident bond is assigned between two cysteines when the follow-
ing two conditions are satisfied: (1) their corresponding aligned residues are
both cysteines, and (2) the two cysteines in the annotated sequence (Sbjct)
form a disulfide bond. The detected confident bonds will be eliminated from
the decision graph to reduce the problem order

Then, we find a maximum weight matching from the remaining
edges. For instance, given the weighted graph of the remaining M
cysteine pairs, we can calculate the possibility of each disulfide con—
nectivity pattern as follows:

Pi:p1+p2+"'+PMa  

where p,- (/ : 1,2, . . . ,M) is the contact potential. Thus, the disulfide
connectivity pattern with the maximum score will be predicted as
the result, i.e.

u : argmax{P,-} (6)

i:1,2,---,N

where u is the argument of i that maximizes P,- of Equation 5. The
final predicted disulfide connectivity pattern is determined by two
sub—predictors: (i) confident bond detector and (ii) maximum weight
graph matching of Equation 6.

2.6 Application in QUARK—based ab initio structure
prediction

QUARK is a recently developed method for ab initio protein struc—
ture prediction (Xu and Zhang, 2012). The structure fragments of
1—20 residues are first identified from unrelated protein structures
by gapless matches. The full—length structure models are then con—
structed by reassembling the fragments using replica—exchange
Monte Carlo simulations under the guidance of a composite physics—
and knowledge—based force field, where the residue—based contacts
derived from the distance profiles of short—range fragments are inte—
grated as restraints to the force field (Xu and Zhang, 2013b). The
QUARK method has been systematically tested in both blind CASP
experiment (Xu et (11., 2011) and genome—wide structure predictions
(Xu and Zhang, 2013a) and demonstrated considerable advantage
over peer methods on ab initio protein structure folding (Lee, 2012).

To integrate the disulfide bond predictions, each distance re—
straint with a cutoff of 8  was implemented in the QUARK simula—
tions by:

Sgt/#310 (7)

where d,,- is the distance of Cu atoms of the 1th and jth residues that
are predicted by Cyscon as disulfide—bonded. Considering the accur—
acy for disulfide bond prediction is high, U0 is set to 30 energy units,
corresponding to a strong restraint potential. The final models are
selected by SPICKER clustering of the QUARK simulation decoys
and ranked by the size of the structure clusters (Zhang and Skolnick,
2004b).

2.7 Evaluation criteria

The disulfide bond predictions are evaluated with two widely
used criteria QC and Qp, which are defined as chNC/TC and
Qp : N p/Tp, respectively, where NC is the number of disulfide bonds
that are correctly predicted, TC is the total number of disulfide
bonds in the dataset, Np is the number of protein sequences whose
disulfide connectivity patterns are correctly predicted and Tp is the
total number of protein sequences in the dataset.

The quality of the 3D structure models of the QUARK predic—
tions is evaluated by the RMSD and TM—score (Zhang and
Skolnick, 2004c), where the TM—score has been demonstrated to be
more sensitive to the fold of protein structures, especially for very
similar low—resolution structures that nevertheless still have high
RMSD. A model with TM—score > 0.5 to native usually indicates
correct modeling at the fold level based on large—scale statistics of
PDB structures (Xu and Zhang, 2010).

3 Results

3.1 Evaluation of confident bond detector

In this work, we proposed a straightforward confident bond de—
tector to reduce the decision order. This approach identifies disulfide
bonds through searching the query sequence against a database with
disulfide connectivity pattern annotations. We have tested this ap—
proach on three different annotated databases. The first is the
benchmark SPX dataset, the second is benchmark PDBCYS dataset
and the third is a bigger one called bDD collected from the recent re—
lease of Swiss—Prot database.

In the case of SPX dataset, we performed a 10—fold cross—valid—
ation, which uses HHsearch (Soding, 2005) to scan and match each
of the test sequences against the annotated database that consists of
the sequences from the other nine training folds. The best aligned se—
quence with the lowest E—value was selected to assign disulfide
bonds to the query sequence using its annotation (Fig. 2). Detected
disulfide bonds through this approach are very reliable by the fact
that 301 from 322 assigned bonds are correct, which involves 173
tested protein sequences. The prediction accuracy of QC is as high as
93.5%. For the PDBCYS dataset, we performed 20—fold cross—valid—
ation. Finally, there are total 215 assigned bonds, and 199 bonds are
correct, where 106 protein sequences are involved. The accuracy of
QC is 92.6%.

We also evaluated this approach on a bigger annotated disulfide
bonds database (bDD), which was constructed based on the newest
Swiss—Prot database. This database was constructed according to the

following procedures: (i) sequences with at least one disulfide bond
have been collected; (ii) sequences annotated with ambiguous or un—
certain terms, such as ‘potential’, ‘probable’, ‘probably’, ‘maybe’,
‘likely’ or ‘by similarity’ were excluded; (iii) inter—chain bonds were
also excluded. Finally, we will obtain 3476 protein sequences in
bDD. It’s important to note that in the testing process, we do not
use any sequence in bDD that shares more than 25 % sequence iden—
tity with the query sequence for strict evaluation purpose. By search—
ing the SPX/PDBCYS dataset against bDD, the proposed confident
bond detector assigned 455/285 bonds for 220/145 tested protein se—
quences on the two datasets, respectively, where 422/272 bonds are
correct (QC : 92.7%/95.4%).

The above results demonstrate the following two interesting ob—
servations: (i) The coverage for bonds found by the confident bond
detector can be improved when using a bigger annotated database.
When tested on the SPX dataset with 10—fold cross—validation, the
bond—based coverage is only 322/1265 225.5%, but this number
increased to 455/1265 : 36.0% on the new bDD database. On the
PDBCYS dataset, the coverage is increased from 215/804226.7%
to 285/804235.4% when using bDD as the searching pool. (ii)
Despite the different coverage ratios, all assigned disulfide bonds
through the confident bond detector are very accurate. For instance,
the QC will reach 92.6 and 95.4% on the PDBCYS and bDD data—
bases, respectively. The results show that these detected bonds can
be reliably removed from the undirected weighted graph to reduce
the order of the model. Supplementary Tables S3—S5 show the per—
formance at the different sequence identity thresholds.

3.2 Order reduction—driven hierarchical protocol
enhances the prediction performance

Compared with the pure machine learning—based predictors, the
new order reduction—driven hierarchical protocol is able to signifi—
cantly improve the prediction accuracies. Tables 1 and 2 summarize
the results obtained from the final consensus hierarchical protocol
on the SPX and PDBCYS datasets, respectively. Taking the case of
bDD as the searching pool as an example, on the SPX dataset, the
Cyscon model can achieve the average prediction accuracies of QC
and Qp as 72.9 and 66.3%, respectively for B :2—5 group, which
are 10.9 and 9.0% higher than the pure machine learning—based
SVR model. Similarly, on the PDBCYS dataset, QC and Qp have
been improved 10.8 and 13.0%.

It can be also observed from Tables 1 and 2 that when we used
the bigger annotated database bDD as the searching pool, the results
are all better than the cases of cross—validation searching the smaller
SPX and PDBCYS datasets. The reason is that the coverage of de—
tected confident bonds is increased as well when using the bigger
bDD. It’s interesting to observe that the improvement is higher on
the PDBCYS dataset. For instance, Qp is improved from 65.4 to
66.3% (0.9%) for B :2—5 group on the SPX dataset, while on the
PDBCYS dataset, Qp is improved from 65.3 to 72.3% (7.0%). To
dig the reason, we calculated the overlap ratios between the confi—
dent bonds searched from different annotated pools and those bonds
with the largest probability predicted by the SVR model. On the
SPX dataset, the overlap ratios are 23.6 and 23.5% when using the
smaller SPX and bigger bDD, respectively, which are very close. On
the contrary, for the PDBCYS dataset, the two ratios are 31.6 and
27.7%, respectively. In the maximum weight graph matching step,
the predicted bond with the largest probability may be selected as a
component bond of connectivity pattern in a greedy way. Thus, the
lower the overlap ratio is, the more helpful of the detected confident
bonds to the final system performance due to the more diversity

generated in the consensus system. Hence, on the PDBCYS dataset,
using bDD is more helpful since the overlap ratio is 3.9% lower
than the smaller pool, whereas this number is 0.1% on the SPX
dataset.

One of the most challenging problems in disulfide connectivity
pattern prediction is the high order problem. For example, if there
are 6 bonds in the protein sequence, we will have to find the unique
real connectivity pattern from 10 395 candidates (Equation 4), and
the random assignment correctness ratio will be as low as 0.096%).
This extreme imbalance significantly limits the feasibility of the
maximum weight perfect matching approach. Motivated by the idea
of reducing the problem order, we eliminate the detected confident
bonds in the first layer. Through this way, the possible solutions can
be decreased exponentially and the problem can be thus solved
much more easily. From Tables 1 and 2, we can already see that the
performance is improved as expected for the group of B : 2—5.

In order to demonstrate our approach for dealing with higher
order proteins, we collected 36 and 51 proteins with B : 6—10 bonds
from the SPX and PDBCYS datasets for independent tests, respect—
ively. Tables 1 and 2 show Cyscon’s results on the higher order
group of B: 6—10. As shown in Table 1, when we used the pure
SVR model on SPX, only 4 out of 36 proteins’ connectivity patterns
can be correctly predicted (Qp:11.1%). While the number was
increased to eight if we introduced the order reduction idea by using
bDD as the searching pool (Qp:22.2%). Our results demonstrate
that the order—reduction approach is especially useful for reducing

the order. For instance, the test protein of 1ole has eight disulfide
bonds. The traditional pure SVR prediction model has to determine
the unique pattern from 2 027 025 candidates, which failed.
However in the Cyscon protocol, 5 confident bonds have been iden—
tified in the first layer, which has significantly reduced the original
searching problem to much less 15 candidates, which is finally cor—
rectly predicted.

Similarly, for the 51 proteins of B : 6—10 in the PDBCYS data—
set, only 1 connectivity pattern can be correctly predicted when
using the pure SVR model (Qp:2.0%). This serious situation was
relieved by using the order reduction. Concretely, 6 more proteins
can be correctly predicted (Qp : 13.7%), i.e. 3 proteins with 6
bonds, 1 protein with 7 bonds and 2 proteins with 8 bonds. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the order reduction strategy
in Cyscon.

3.3 Comparison with existing predictors

To compare with the recent state—of—the—art methods (Savojardo
et (11., 2011, 2013), we also evaluated our method on the benchmark
PDBCYS dataset using the same 20—fold cross—validation and also
the same folds as previous studies. This dataset is homology reduced
at the 25 % sequence identity level. Table 2 shows the results. As can
be seen, the Cyscon model gives better results than DISLOCATE
(Savojardo et (11., 2011), which was trained with the additional fea—
ture of subcellular localization. It also outperforms DMC

Fig. 3. Illustration of Cyscon on the case protein of 1jch. Bold lines indicate
the observed or predicted disulfide bonds. SVR tries to detect the pattern in
all 105 possible combination candidates. In Cyscon, by removing 2 confident
edges, it tries to detect the pattern in 3 possible combination candidates

(DISLOCATE+MIp +iCOV) (Savojardo et (11., 2013), which was
trained with additional correlated mutation features calculated by
using MIp (Dunn et (11., 2008) and PSICOV (Jones et (11., 2012). The
overall accuracies of QC and Qp of final Cyscon are 77.0 and
72.3%, respectively, which are 10.8 and 13.0% higher than DMC.
The power of the newly developed Cyscon on the high order pro—
teins is obvious. Taking the subset of B :5 for instance (compared
to B24), Qp drops 25% accuracy in DISLOCATE and 18.8% in
DMC, while Cyscon drops only 2.0%. This also demonstrates the
efficacy of the proposed order reduction approach for high order
problems. It’s also worthy to mention that Cyscon detected 285 con—
fident bonds in the first layer on the PDBCYS dataset, and these
bonds will not be participated in the final maximum weight match—
ing decision process, which is one of the major reasons for the per—
formance improvement.

3.4 Case study

To highlight why Cyscon works better, we take the protein 11'ch as
an example. There are 4 native disulfide bonds in this protein, i.e.
C11—C63, C24—C48, C33—C58 and C37—C60. Hence, there will be
105 possible combination patterns in this sequence. For the pure
machine learning—based SVR model, it mistakenly predicted the di—
sulfide connectivity pattern as: C11—C33, C24—C48, C37—C5 8 and
C60—C63 (Fig. 3). Thus, only the second bond is correct, which
makes QC : 12.5% and Qp : 0% on this protein.

However, in the final confident bond—driven Cyscon predictor,
the confident bond detector found 2 confident bonds as C33—C58
and C37—C60. We thus eliminated the two confident edges from the
undirected weighted graph. Then we performed maximum perfect
matching algorithm on the order—reduced weighted graph composed
of only four cysteine residues, which has only three possible combin—
ation patterns. Expectedly, we obtained a correct sub connectivity
pattern of C11—C63 and C24—C48. Together with the two steps,
Cyscon predicted the correct connectivity pattern QC: 100% and
Qp : 100% for the protein 11'ch as illustrated in Figure 3.

3.5 Application to 3D structure modeling of
cysteine—rich proteins

There are many cysteine—rich proteins, such as from various toxins
etc. A common feature of the cysteine—rich proteins is that there are

many disulfide bonds. Although the structure prediction field has
achieved great successes in the past decade, there are few structural
modelers that are specifically developed for the cysteine—rich pro—
teins. A typical feature for the cysteine—rich protein 3D structure pre—
dictors is that they should be capable of incorporating the disulfide
bonds as restraints. We have obtained statistics on 105 339 entries
in the current PDB database, where 15 429 structures are found to
have at least 3 disulfide bonds (~14.6%). The high ratio also indi—
cates the importance of adding the disulfide connectivity pattern
into the structure prediction, especially considering that most of
them are long—range contacts.

To examine quantitatively the usefulness of the predicted disul—
fide connectivity patterns to protein 3D structure prediction, we col—
lected 15 8 protein sequences (see supplementary Table S2) from the
PDB with experimentally determined 3D structures according to the
following criteria: (i) solved by X—ray diffraction; (ii) resolution less
than 2.5 A; (iii) number of bonds not less than 3; (iv) number of resi—
dues not less than 20 and not more than 100; and (v) sequence iden—
tity not more than 30%. We focused on the small proteins below
100 residues because the number of the disulfide bond pairs is rela—
tively low (3—5), compared with the coverage of contacts normally
needed to derive the tertiary structure (>L/10) (Li et (11., 2004; Wu
and Zhang, 2008; Zhang et (11., 2003).

We first predicted the disulfide connectivity patterns for the 158
proteins from their primary sequence with the above Cyscon pre—
dictor; then, we used the ab initio modeling software QUARK (Xu
and Zhang, 2012) to predict their 3D structures in two cases: (i)
without restraints from the connectivity patterns; and (ii) with re—
straints from the predicted connectivity patterns. The average results
are listed in Table 3.

From Table 3, we can see that the connectivity pattern restraints
improve the accuracy of protein 3D structure modeling. Despite the
low coverage of the disulfide bond predictions relative to the normal
contact predictions, the results show an average improvement of
12.1% for TM—score and 14.4% for RMSD by the introduction of
the Cyscon predictions. There are 10 protein models that improved
from TM—score below 0.5 to above 0.5 as shown in Table S2
(1ede, 1hypA, 1n69A, 1p9gA, 2posA, 2rjiA, 3qteA, 3564A, 3tva
and 4i6oA).

In Figure 4, we show three examples of QUARK versus Cyscon—
assisted QUARK modeling of 3qteA, 1p9gA and 4i6oA, respect—
ively. First, 3qteA is an antimicrobial protein with 32 residues,
where Cyscon generated 3 disulfide bond predictions which are all
correct. The first model by the original QUARK simulation without
Cyscon only has 1 disulfide bond satisfied which resulted in an in—
correct fold with TM—score : 0.166. When integrated with the

Cyscon predictions, 3 Cyscon contacts were satisfied and the TM—
score of the first QUARK model was increased to 0.572 (Fig. 4a).
The second example from 1p9gA is an antifungal protein with 40
residues and 5 disulfide bond predictions by Cyscon. Again, the in—
clusion of the Cyscon contacts increased the number of disulfide
bond satisfaction from 2 to 4, and therefore the TM—score of the first
model improved from 0.206 to 0.508 (Fig. 4b). The final example is
an alpha protein from 4i6oA with 68 residues. Cyscon generated 3
disulfide bonds with an accuracy : 100%, where 0 of them are satis—
fied in the original QUARK model. The Cyscon—assisted QUARK
model has 3 predicted disulfide bonds satisfied which brought the
TM—score of the first model from 0.286 to 0.676 (Fig. 4c).

4 Discussion

One challenge to the ab initio prediction of disulfide connectivity
pattern is the high order problem, i.e. the prediction accuracy will
drop significantly with the increasing of number of disulfide bonds.
The mathematical reason to the issue is that the number of possible
disulfide connectivity patterns increases exponentially with the num—
ber of Cyscine residues (Supplementary Fig. S1). It consequently in—
duces the high order of graph search in the maximum weight graph
matching. Motivated by the straightforward idea of order reduction,
we developed a novel disulfide bond predictor, Cyscon, which suc—
cessfully reduces the graph matching order by eliminating the highly
confident disulfide bonds, which are detected by a newly designed
detector.

The high order problem can be effectively solved by the proposed
approach of this paper, resulting in significant improvement of the
prediction performance. For instance, on the SPX dataset, the

residue—based accuracy (QC) and the protein—based accuracy (Qp) in
the subset of test proteins with 5 bonds are 16.7 and 24.8% higher,
respectively when comparing the final Cyscon predictor to the pure
machine learning—based SVR method. For the proteins with more
than five bonds, Qp is two times better than the original perform—
ance. On the PDBCYS dataset, Qp is 6.9 times better than the pure
SVR model for the proteins of 6—10 bonds.

Inspired by the improvements from sequence alignment—based
order reduction, we have also tried to remove the edge with the
highest weight corresponding to machine learning—based contact po—
tential for comparison. However, the results are much worse. For
the 428 protein sequences in the SPX dataset, we found that QC is
284/428 : 66.4%, which is far worse than the proposed confident
edge detector. The reason is probably due to the noise from SVR
predictions which has a lower confidence than the stringent se—
quence—alignment derivations.

Although the order reduction approach can improve the predic—
tion performance, we found that the improvement depends on the
detection coverage. Our experimental results show that when using
the big bDD as the searching pool, the improvement is generally
higher. We will keep on updating bDD database to include the most
up—to—date data for improving the confident bond detection success
rate, which is expected to further enhance the overall prediction ac—
curacy for high order protein sequences.

Besides the high order problem, inter—chain disulfide bond pre—
diction is another important issue need to be addressed. However,
there are few studies devoted to the problem probably due to the
fact that the annotated inter—chain bonds are very few in the current
databases. This type of bond is related to protein quaternary struc—
ture and protein—protein interactions. Hence, predicting inter—chain
disulfide bonds will be an important follow—up work, where similar
idea of order reduction might expect to be helpful.

We also show that predicting reliable disulfide connectivity pat—
terns can improve the 3D structure modeling of cysteine—rich pro—
teins. Using QUARK (Xu and Zhang, 2012) as an example, our data
show that the quality of ab initio structure predictions can be signifi—
cantly improved when adding the predicted disulfide connectivity
patterns as distance restraints. This is consistent with the exciting
successes on contact—driven protein structure prediction recently
observed in the CASP 11 experiment (Grishin, 2014) and other con—
tact—assisted structure prediction efforts (Marks et (11., 2011; Wu
et (11., 201 1).

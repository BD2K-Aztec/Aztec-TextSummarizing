from 16 countries across the ﬁve continents, with 49 authors
from North America, 101 from Europe, 9 from Asia (excluding
Israel), 8 from Israel, 5 from Australia and 1 from Saudi Arabia.
The conference papers with their supplementary ﬁles are avail—
able in electronic format via online open access to the journal
Bionformatics from August 27, 2014. A unique PDF file contain—
ing all papers and supplementary files with an index has been
prepared for download by the participants through the
Bioinformatics web site.

The call for posters (500—word abstracts) was also managed
through the EasyChair multi—track conference system. It was
kept open until 2 weeks after the notiﬁcation of the oral presen—
tations so that authors whose manuscript could not be accepted
had the opportunity to resubmit their work as a poster. A com—
mittee of 54 reviewers looked at the abstracts and accepted about
520 posters from 542 submissions. Accepted posters were distrib—
uted as follows: ‘Sequencing and sequence analysis for genomics’:
93 posters; ‘Gene expression’: 50 posters; ‘Pathways and molecu—
lar networks’: 37 posters; ‘Computational systems biology’: 53
posters; ‘Structural bioinformatics’: 92 posters; ‘Evolution and
population genomics’: 28 posters; ‘Bioinformatics of health and
disease’: 56 posters; ‘Biological knowledge discovery from data,
texts and bio—images’: 45 posters; ‘Methods and technologies for
computational biology’: 68 posters. Unfortunately, and despite
their poster acceptance, a few authors were unable to make the
trip to Strasbourg owing to visa problems or lack of ﬁnancial
support. The organizing committee deeply regrets this situation,
which is beyond its control. All poster abstracts are available on
the conference web site.

Highlight presentations were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2007
in Vienna, and immediately became one of the most popular
features of the conference. All papers that had been published
in peer—review journals (no book chapters) between January 1,
2013, and the submission deadline of June 2, 2014, were eligible
to be presented as a Highlight Talk. The ECCB’14 organizing
committee selected 10 proposals out of 55 submissions, mainly
on the criteria of compatibility with the proceedings papers, wide
impact in the life sciences and the potential for attracting a large
audience to the conference.

The industrial and demo track at ECCB’14 provides commer—
cial organizations and academic institutions with the opportunity
to present their products or services: software, database, infra—
structures, etc. Demo fees give access to two 30—min slots for
repeating the demo and reaching a large number of conference
attendees. Twelve demos are scheduled, involving among others
four ECCB’14 silver sponsors (BioBase, sbv Improver, Koriscale
and Totalinux), the French and the Swiss Institutes for Bioinfor—
matics (IFB, SIB), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL: Uniprot demo), the French National Institute for
Research in Agronomy (INRA: BioMercator demo) and the
Galaxy project. A free demo slot was also proposed to several
refused paper submissions that described valuable computational
methods. Four of them accepted this offer.

Ten exhibitor booths will be open throughout the conference
in the conference hall, presenting the latest scientiﬁc literature in
the ﬁeld of computational biology, bioinformatics, modeling and
simulation, as well as new hardware, software and technology
developments.

During the weekend before the conference, two satellite meet—
ings, 10 tutorials and 15 workshops will take place. The Student
Council of the International Society for Computational Biology
(ISCB) organizes its 3rd European Student Council Symposium
(ESCS), chaired by Pieter Meysman (University of Antwerp) and
Margherita Francescatto (VU University Medical Center,
Amsterdam). ESCS abstracts accepted for oral presentation
will be published in a special issue of the BMC Bioinformatics
journal. The second satellite meeting is the Junior Principal
Investigator (JPI) meeting, which aims to help junior PIs antici—
pate and manage the challenges of running a research group and
to learn from successful examples of established young PIs. It is
organized by Virginie Bernard (Curie Institute, Paris), Magali
Michaut (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam), Lennart
Martens (Ghent University and VIB) and Theodore Alexandrov
(University of Bremen — University of California San Diego). The
ECCB’14 organizing committee congratulates all these dynamic
young scientists for their enthusiasm, which is essential to the
future of research in computational biology.

The eighth International Workshop on Machine Learning in
Systems Biology (MLSB) will take place on Saturday and
Sunday, September 6—7, under the direction of Florence
d’Alché—Buc (University of Evry) and Pierre Geurts (University
of Liege, Belgium). Invited speakers are Pierre Baldi (UCI
University, California), Karsten Borgwardt (ETH Ziirich),
Jean—Loup Faulon (University of Evry) and Nicola Segata
(University of Trento).

Most other workshops and tutorials are 1—day events,
taking place either on Saturday, September 6, or on Sunday,
September 7.

The very active domain of biological network study is covered
by three complementary workshops: (1) ‘Logical Modelling and
Analysis of Cellular Networks’, organized on 11/2 days by Denis
Thieffry (Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris) and Ioannis Xenarios
(Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne); (2) ‘BioNetVisA’,
organized by Ina Kuperstein (Institut Curie, Paris) and col—
leagues, with the objective of going ‘From biological network
reconstruction to data visualization and analysis in molecular
biology and medicine’, and hosting the EMBO lecture by
Yosef Yarden (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot,
Israel); and (3) ‘Integrative Dynamic Analyses of Large
Biomedical Network Data’, organized by Natasa Przulj
(Imperial College, London) and Tijana Milenkovic (University
of Notre Dame, Indiana).

The workshop entitled ‘Analysis of differential isoform usage
by RNA—seq: statistical methodologies and open software’ is
organized by Magnus Rattray (University of Manchester) and
colleagues. The workshop on ‘Computational and Systems Biol—
ogy for Disease Comorbidities’ is organized by Ana'is Baudot
(CNRS, Marseille) and Alfonso Valencia (CNIO, Madrid).
The workshop entitled ‘Drug Development 2.0’, organized by
Jan Baumbach (University of South Denmark) and colleagues,
will address computational integrative biology methods for drug
repurposing, target discovery and translational research. The
workshop on ‘Next Generation Computational Biology for
Food Security’, organized by Sue Jones (The James Hutton Insti—
tute, Dundee) will present novel approaches in crop genomics
and computational biology to meet the challenges of food secur—
ity in a changing climate. The workshop entitled ‘Recent

computational advances in metagenomics’ is organized by
Sophie Schbath (INRA—MIG, Jouy—en—Josas) and
colleagues. The workshop on ‘Tools and Techniques for Analysis
and Design of Macromolecular Structures’ organized by
Samuel C. Flores (Uppsala University) and Grzegorz
Chojnowski (International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biol—
ogy, Warsaw) will propose both a lecture session and hands—on
exercises. Two workshops will introduce or report on research
competitions: (1) the workshop on ‘Informatics—based
approaches for circular dichroism data’ organized by Robert
Janes and Lazaros Mavridis from Queen Mary University
(London) that will introduce the CIDASE challenge, speciﬁcally
aimed at the relationship between circular dichroism spectra and
information content, and (2) the ‘sbv IMPROVER’ workshop
organized by Manuel Peitsch (Philip Morris International) and
colleagues, that will report on the three sbv (‘systems biology
verif1cation’) challenges organized so far. ECCB’14 will also
give emerging new scientiﬁc communities the opportunity to
launch two new workshops: the ‘1St workshop on Computational
Methods for Structural RNAs — CMRS’14’ organized by Fabrice
Jossinet (University of Strasbourg) and colleagues, and the ‘1St
Unif1ed Workshop on Proteome and Metabolome Informatics’
by Andrew Dowsey (University of Manchester) and colleagues.
We wish a successful future to these initiatives. Finally and
importantly, the sometimes ambiguous relations between bioin—
formaticians and life scientists will be discussed in the workshop
on the ‘Dual Beneﬁt of Bioinformatics Training’ organized by
Vicky Schneider, from the Scientiﬁc Training, Education and
Learning division at The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC,
Norwich). The ECCB’14 organizing committee wishes to thank
all workshop organizers for their efforts in making these work—
shops high—quality and attractive events.

Tutorials at ECCB’14 will address a wide range of topics:
‘Analysis of cis—regulatory motifs from high—throughput
sequence set’ by Jacques van Helden and Morgane Thomas—
Cholliers (Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris); ‘Computational
tools to deﬁne and analyse logical models of cellular networks’

domains’ by Davide Bar] and Francois Serra (CNAG—CRG, Bar—
celona). The ECCB’14 organizing committee is grateful to all

tutorial organizers and lecturers for their involvement in all
these events.

ECCB has a tradition of Art Meets Science that turned into a
web art contest this year. We received 14 artistic banner pro—
posals for the web site, and these banners were displayed alter—
natively in a random manner during the weeks before the
conference. The vote for the best banner will be organized
during the ECCB conference with a prestigious prize offered
by the LORIA (Lorraine Laboratory of Research in Computer
Science and its Applications, Nancy). The winning banner will
remain associated with the ECCB’14 web site.

Encouraging the participation of young scientists has always
been a central goal of ECCB, as this conference is a signiﬁcant
opportunity for education and networking for early—stage scien—
tists. We received more than one hundred applications for travel
fellowships from young scientists with an oral or poster presen—
tation. Thanks to our academic and commercial sponsors and to
the careful control of conference costs, we could satisfy about
two—third of the requests. In addition, all fellowship recipients
benefited from a reduction on their registration fees.

It is our pleasure to thank all the people and organizations
that are making ECCB’14 a successful and high—quality confer—
ence. The crucial and dedicated work performed by the program
committee composed of the area chairs, the reviewers and co—
reviewers has already been acknowledged above. We are grateful
to the regional cross—border organizing committee and to the
ECCB steering committee for their support and contribution
to the organization of the conference. In particular, the advice
and experience shared by Torsten Schwede as organizer of the
successful ECCB’12 in Basel was invaluable. Thank you Torsten
for your almost constant availability! The cooperation and sup—
port of ISCB (International Society for Computational Biology)
was much appreciated for diffusing the information about
ECCB’14 at the international level and for offering student
fellowships.

We thank all those who provided financial support to the
conference, especially our five silver sponsors BioBase, sbv
IMPROVER, Koriscale, Totalinux and GPB (Genomics, Pro—
teomics and Bioinformatics, The ofﬁcial journal of the Beijing
Institute of Genomics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Genetics Society of China). We also acknowledge support from
the French Institute of Bioinformatics (IFB), the French Society
for Bioinformatics (SFBI), the CNRS research group on Biol—
ogy, Computer Science and Mathematics (GDR BIM), the Euro—
pean Grid Infrastructure (EGI), the Research Institutes: INRA,
Inria (who sponsored the travel expenses of our keynote speak—
ers), EMBI—EBI and the Italian Society for Bioinformatics that
offered student fellowships.

We are grateful to the Oxford University Press production
team for the preparation of this special issue and to the staff
of the CNRS Alsace regional delegation for taking on the ad—
ministrative and financial burden of the registration process. We
wish to thank the staff at the Congress Centre of Strasbourg and
Christine Guibert from the University of Strasbourg for their
help in preparing the logistics of hosting the conference, and
the city of Strasbourg for providing the ECCB’14 welcome cock—
tail. Moreover, we are pleased to acknowledge the kind support
of the Council of Europe which provided the attendee bags and
for agreeing to host the gala evening in its nice reception hall and

gardens along the Ill river. We also especially thank Laurence
Lwoff, Head of the Bioethics Unit, for her talk scheduled at the
conference opening, in which she will share the Council of
Europe’s concerns about the bio—ethical challenges raised by
the usage of biobanks and biomedical data in research and its
applications.

Many people contributed to the local organization of the con—
ference, often much beyond the call of duty, and we owe them a
great debt, in particular Anne Ney, Luc Moulinier and all the
other members of the LBGI Bioinformatics and Integrative
Genomics group from the iCUBE laboratory in Strasbourg,
and various administrative and scientiﬁc members of the
LORIA laboratory and Inria Nancy Grand—Est research center
in Nancy.

Finally, all these efforts would be meaningless without the
many participants from all over the world. Each of you will
bring something to the conference in terms of scientiﬁc contri—
butions, oral or poster presentations and discussions. Thank you
all for being there and for allowing us to enjoy our science at
ECCB’14 in Strasbourg!

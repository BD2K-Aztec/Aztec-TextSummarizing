Abstract

Motivation: Multiple high—throughput approaches have recently been developed and allowed the
discovery of enhancers on a genome scale in a single experiment. However, the datasets gener—
ated from these approaches are not fully utilized by the research community due to technical chal—
lenges such as lack of consensus enhancer annotation and integrative analytic tools.

Results: We developed an interactive database, EnhancerAtlas, which contains an atlas of
2,534,123 enhancers for 105 cell/tissue types. A consensus enhancer annotation was obtained for
each cell by summation of independent experimental datasets with the relative weights derived
from a cross—validation approach. Moreover, EnhancerAtlas provides a set of useful analytic tools
that allow users to query and compare enhancers in a particular genomic region or associated with
a gene of interest, and assign enhancers and their target genes from a custom dataset.

Availability and Implementation: The database with analytic tools is available at http://www.enhan
ceratlas.orgl.

Enhancers are distal regulatory DNA elements that regulate tran—
scription levels of target genes. They play an important role in devel—
opment and diseases (Ghavi—Helm et (11., 2014; Hnisz et (11., 2013).
Unlike promoters, enhancers often regulate expression of their target
genes independent of their relative location, distance or even the

are often tissue— or cell type—specific (Heinz et (11., 2015; Pennacchio
et (11., 2013). Due to the relative location and tissue specificity, it is
challenging to identify enhancers.

Recently, many technologies were developed to map the enhan—
cers on a genome scale. (i) Clusters of transcription factor (TF)

binding sites often represent regulatory elements (Spitz and Furlong,
2012), and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing
(ChIP—seq) or ChIP—chip can be used to identify the binding sites of
various TFs or other regulatory factors; (ii) A few enhancer—specific
factors have been used to identify enhancers. For example, EP300, a
histone acetyltransferase, activates transcription via acetylating the
histones. Therefore, the binding sites of EP300 were often used to
predict enhancers (Visel et (11., 2009); (iii) It was reported that RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) binds to thousands of enhancers (Kim et (11.,
2010). Therefore, binding sites of POLR2A, the largest subunit of
RNAPII, are considered to be the active regulatory regions; (iv)
DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHS) represent the open chromatin
regions, many of which cover the enhancers (Thurman et (11., 2012);
(v) Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements
(FAIRE) coupled with sequencing is another method to identify
large numbers of active regulatory elements including enhancers
(Gaulton et (11., 2010); (vi) Some histone modification patterns re—
ﬂect different chromatin states. For example, the combination of
H3K4me1 and H3K27ac is a widely used mark for enhancers
(Cotney et (11., 2012; Heintzman et (11., 2009); (vii) The DNA se—
quences of enhancers could also be transcribed and these transcribed
enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are an indicator of active enhancers
(Andersson et (11., 2014); (viii) Approaches to determine the three—
dimensional conformation of chromosomes (e.g. 5 C and ChIA—PET,
Capture—C) are able to provide enhancer—promoter interactions
(Fullwood et (11., 2009; Jin et (11., 2013).

These above approaches have been demonstrated as powerful
tools to detect enhancers on a genome—wide scale, and they have
been applied to many cell types or tissues. However, the datasets
generated by these approaches are not fully utilized by the research
community due to several technical challenges. First, these datasets
are often disseminated in different databases. A centralized data por—
tal is still lacking that is specially designed for enhancer analysis.
Second, enhancer annotations based on different technologies
showed large discrepancies. A consensus of enhancers will provide
more reliable annotation of enhancers. Third, although several gen—
ome annotation databases (e.g. UCSC Genome Browser) are cur—
rently available to visualize various datasets, they do not provide
useful tools for enhancer analysis, such as comparing enhancers
across different cell types, generating network views for enhancer—
target interactions, and predict enhancers for a custom dataset.

The goal of our work is of two—fold. First, we combined a large
number of available datasets in each cell/tissue type to produce a
‘consensus’ of enhancers that represent the most reliable prediction
of enhancers. For this purpose, we develop an unsupervised learning
approach to evaluate the quality of each dataset in one cell type and
generate a consensus for more reliable enhancer identification.
Using this method, we produced enhancer predictions for 76 cell
lines and 29 tissues. These enhancer predictions have high quality
compared with single dataset. Second, we constructed a user—
friendly, interactive online database, EnhancerAtlas.0rg, to facilitate
the analysis of enhancers for different cell types. A series of analytic
tools were developed to extract, compare and visualize the enhan—
cers in different cell types.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Data sources

We used a total of eight types of experimental approaches (i.e.
tracks) to identify enhancers. They include DHS, FAIRE, eRNA,
P300 binding sites, POL2 binding sites, histone modifications, TF

binding sites and CHIA—PET. These tracks represent distinct experi—
mental approaches to detect enhancers. Note that some tracks could
contain multiple datasets. For example, replicates sometimes exist
for the same experiments that were performed by different labs. The
‘TF—Binding’ track includes all ChIP—Seq datasets for different TFs in
a given cell type. The ‘histone’ track includes the datasets for
H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. To make a reliable enhancer annotation,
we only used cell lines and tissues with at least three tracks. In total,
76 cell lines and 29 tissues were included. We processed and inte—
grated 3785 high throughput datasets (Table 1). All sequencing data
were mapped to the hg19 genome assembly. Since some approaches
(e.g. DHS) detect all active regulatory regions, promoter and exon
regions were removed in our analysis. Here promoters were defined
as the region 5 kb upstream of the transcription start sites based on a
location analysis of known promoters (Supplementary Figure S1). In
addition, matched RNA—seq data were used for predicting enhancer
target genes, which were collected from UCSC genome browser,
GEO database and Epigenome Roadmap data portal. In total, 48
cell lines and 22 tissues have available RNA—seq data.

2.2 Track normalization
There are a few steps to normalize the datasets. First, to make data—
sets comparable, we take fold enrichment of each region as the sig—
nal intensity and normalize it in each dataset. For each genomic
window of 10 bp, the normalization for each data set is defined as:

I 5i

n

ism/:1.-
1 1

Where 5,- and l,- are the score and length of peak 1' (1 S i g n),
respectively. Second, many tracks, including DHS, EP300, POL2,
FAIRE, may have two or more replicates. We summed the signal
intensities in normalized files into one file using bedtools (Quinlan
and Hall, 2010) and normalized the merged file again. Furthermore,
the ‘TF—binding’ track may contain many ChIP—seq datasets from
different TFs, and ‘histone modification’ track contains two differ—
ent modifications (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac). We also merged dif—
ferent TFs or modifications into one track.

2.3 Generation of consensus tracks

A basic assumption of our approach is that if two datasets are of
good quality, they should have a good correlation of the predicted
enhancers. On the other hand, if one dataset is of low quality, it will
have low correlation with other datasets. By comparing the correl—
ations between different datasets, we obtain the relative quality for
each dataset. For two given tracks A1 and A2, the voting score of A2
on A1 was defined as the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) be—
tween A1 and A2:

Z§‘(ScoreA1  — ScoreA1 )(ScoreA2 — ScoreAz)

\/Z§‘(ScoreA1  — ScoreA1 )2 \/Z§‘(ScoreA2  — ScoreA2 )2

 

1’A,A2 I

 

 

Where ScoreA1 and ScoreA1 represent the score at genomic
position i and the mean of all position scores in track A1, respect—
ively. Then a PCC matrix can be obtained from a cell line or tissue
with m tracks:

track at genomic position i as:

By doing so, the score at each genomic positon in the consensus
track came from reasonable weight assignments of all tracks.

2.4 Validation of enhancer predictions using the VISTA
enhancer database

To evaluate our consensus track using experimentally validated
enhancer documented in the VISTA database (Visel et al.,
2007), we first grouped enhancers according to their tissue
types. We selected two tissues (i.e. brain and heart) with the
largest number of enhancers. The brain and heart have 809 and
96 validated enhancers, respectively. Our evaluation is at base
pair level. The Sensitivity Sn and Specificity Sp were defined as
below:

TP TN

S":TP+FN and SPZFP+TN

2.5 Enhancer—target gene prediction

We used a recent developed algorithm Integrated Method for
Predicting Enhancer Targets (IM—PET) to predict enhancer targets
(He et al., 2014). IM—PET predicts enhancer—promoter by inte—
grating four features using a Random Forest classifier. Features
are derived from transcriptomic, epigenomic and genome se—
quence data, including enhancer and promoter activity correl—
ation, TF and promoter activity correlation, enhancer and
promoter sequence co—evolution and enhancer—to—promoter dis—
tance. We showed that IM—PET achieved significant improvement
over other state—of—the—art methods. Further, based on our valid—
ation experiment using 3C—qPCR we showed that IM—PET has a
comparable accuracy to that of the experimental 5C technology.
Here, the input data for IM—PET included the genomic positions
of predicted enhancers, RNA—Seq data and H3K4me1, H3K4me3,
and H3K27Ac ChIP—Seq data for 48 cell lines and 22 tissues.
Enhancer targets were predicted using a false discovery rate cutoff
of 0.01.

2.6 Implementation of the tools

The visualization tools in EnhancerAtlas were implemented by using
html5 canvas element and PHP. The online service of EnhancerAtlas
was implemented with Linux—Apache—MySQL—PHP—HTML—
JavaScript—Perl and could be run on most PCs (Windows, Mac OSX
or Linux). The <canvas> element of HTML was employed to draw
the genomic graph and display the datasets for different approaches
or cell/tissue types. In the graphic display, a jQuery UI slider widget
with two handles was used to zoom in or out on the genome region.
We used the plug—in, cytoscape.js, for analysis and visualization of
enhancer—gene network in a given cell/tissue type. Links in the
graphic presentation or tables were implemented by JavaScript or
php functions.

3 Results

3.1 Selection of available datasets
Many approaches have been developed to map enhancers in cells.
Although enhancers identified by different approaches have an

overall agreement on the enhancer annotation, they showed dis—
crepancies in many genomic regions (Fig. 1A). A consensus of en—
hancers based on multiple experimental evidences will provide a
more reliable enhancer annotation. In this work, we collected
eight types of genome—wide experimental datasets (i.e. tracks) to
identify the enhancers (Fig. 1B). To obtain reliable enhancer an—
notation, we only focused on the cell/tissue types with at least
three independent experimental tracks for enhancer identification
(Fig. 1C). A total of 105 cell/tissue types were collected for the
enhancer annotation in the study. Note that some tracks could
contain multiple datasets (e.g. replicates, multiple histone modifi—
cations for ‘Histone’ track or multiple TF binding datasets for
‘TF—Binding’ track). On the other hand, we kept the tracks for
EP300 and POLR2A binding sites separated from the ‘TF—binding’
track, because these two proteins are important indicators for
enhancers.

We manually collected and integrated 3785 high throughput ex—
perimental datasets (Table 1) mainly from six resources including
UCSC genome browser (Kent et al., 2002), NCBI GEO (Barrett
et al., 2013), Cistrome database (Qin et al., 2012), ENCODE pro—
ject data portal (Consortium, 2012), Epigenome Roadmap data por—
tal (Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015) and eRNA (Andersson
et al., 2014). These datasets will be used to generate consensus en—
hancers for 105 cell/tissue types.

3.2 Unsupervised learning approach for enhancer
identification

To build a consensus of enhancer annotations from multiple data—
sets, one obvious option is supervised learning approach, which re—
quires a set of validated enhancers as a gold standard. By comparing
each dataset to the gold standard, we are able to assess the quality
of each dataset and then assign the relative weight to each dataset.
An ideal gold standard would be a set of enhancers determined by
an in vivo activity—based approach. The VISTA database contains
1746 enhancers identified using comparative genome analysis and
validated using mouse transgenic reporter assay (Visel et al., 2007).
However, since enhancers are cell type specific, a gold standard is
needed for each cell type. In that sense, the dataset in the VISTA is
not large enough to serve as a gold standard for most of the cell
types.

To overcome this challenge, we employed an unsupervised
learning approach to derive the consensus of enhancers from mul—
tiple experimental evidences. Our approach evaluates the quality
of each dataset by cross—validation. The underlying assumption of
our approach is that if two datasets are of good quality, they
should have a good correlation among the predicted enhancers. On
the other hand, if one dataset is of low quality, it will have low cor—
relations with other datasets. By comparing the correlations
between different datasets, we will obtain the relative quality for
each dataset.

Here, we used K562 cell line as an example to elucidate our ap—
proach (Fig. 2). The K5 62 has eight tracks available for enhancer an—
notation, including ‘DHS’, ‘FAIRE’, ‘EP300’, ‘POL2’, ‘Histone’,
‘TF—Binding’, ‘CHIA—PET’ and ‘eRNA’. Among them, 95 TF ChIP—
seq datasets in this cell type were available and used to obtain the
‘TF—Binding’ track. First, we normalized the signal intensity in each
track to make the tracks comparable (see Section 2 for details).
Next, we calculated pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)
of enhancer signals among the eight tracks. Some tracks have very
similar enhancer signals (e.g. locations of EP300 and DHS, with a
PCC of 0.490), while other tracks have relatively low similarity (e.g.

(chr1:27,515,285-27,848,296 in K562), the enhancers supported by many tracks are highlighted by vertical bars. It is clear that many potential regions are only sup-
ported by one or a few tracks. (B) Number of cell/types that contain a certain dataset types. Some technologies were more widely used than others for enhancer
identification. (C) Number of cell/tissue types in function of number of independent tracks. Many cell/tissue types include a few tracks (e.g. 3 or 4), while a few

cell/tissue types have many tracks (e.g. 7 or 8)

signals between ChIA—PET and eRNA, with a PCC of 0.019). Next,
we summed the correlation coefficients of each track with the other
seven tracks. The sum of correlation coefficients for the eight tracks
is normalized to obtain the relative weights (Fig. 2A). Finally, we ob—
tained the consensus track based on the weighted sum of the signals
from individual tracks (Fig. 2B).

3.3 Assessment of relative weights for different tracks
As illustrated by the example of K562, we can see that some tracks
such as DHS have relatively high weights, while other tracks such
as eRNA have relatively low weights. Note that the weights ob—
tained for one particular cell type do not necessarily reﬂect the
quality of the experimental platform in general, because the same
experimental approach might be used to generate datasets with dif—
ferent qualities by different laboratories. We sought to assess the
quality of each dataset, rather than an experimental approach.
Therefore, the relative weights derived by our approach are spe—
cific to each cell type (Fig. 3). For instance, the relative weight for
the track of ‘TF—Binding’ varies significantly among the cell/tissue
types. In MCF—7 cell line the relative weight of ‘TF—Binding’ is
0.252, while the weight for the same track becomes 0.176 in Hela—
S3 cell line. Similarly, while eRNA has a small weight (0.03) in
K562, it has a relatively high weights in other cell types. For ex—
ample, the weights for eRNA in adult heart and bronchia epithelial
are 0.40 and 0.20, respectively. The dynamic changes of each track
among the cell/tissue types reﬂect the data quality of the specific
dataset and the total number of tracks in the cell/tissue type of
interest (Fig. 3).

To confirm that the relative weight indeed reﬂects the data qual—
ity, we performed a simulation on TF binding track in K562 (Fig. 4).

Total 95 TF ChIP—seq datasets were used for ‘TF—Binding’ track in
K562. We assumed that the quality of track increases with more TF
ChIP—seq datasets. While keeping the datasets of other tracks un—
changed, we randomly removed certain numbers of TFs in the TF
binding track and calculated the relative weight for the TF binding
track. We found that the average relative weight decreased with
fewer TFs included in the track, suggesting that relative weight of a
track indeed correlated with the quality of the track (Fig. 4A).
Interestingly, we found that both repressors and activators contrib—
uted to the enhancer prediction. If we separated the TFs into activa—
tors and repressors based on their known function, we obtained 33
activators and 37 repressors with ChIP—seq data in K562. We found
that the weights for both sets increased with increasing number of
TFs, although the repressors’ contribution was less significant than
activators (Fig. 4B).

3.4 Enhancer calling based on weighted
consensus track
To determine enhancers in the consensus track, we first performed
simulation to determine the cutoff for enhancer signal intensity. For
a given cell/tissue type, we shufﬂed each track by generating random
starting positions within the same chromosome. Using the same rela—
tive weights determined as described above, a combined track based
on the shufﬂed tracks was generated and the scores of all positions
in this track were sorted. The score at the top 99.5% was selected as
the cutoff. Only the peaks in the consensus track with score higher
than the cutoff were called as enhancers.

In addition, we had three extra criteria to determine the enhan—
cers in the consensus track. (i) Peaks within 5 kb upstream of the
transcription start sites of protein coding genes were removed

Fig. 2. Overall approach to derive the consensus enhancers. (A) Calculation of relative weight for each track. The correlation coefficients of enhancer signals
among the tracks were first calculated. The summation of the correlation coefficients for each track was normalized to obtain the relative weight. (B) Based on the
weighted sum of the signals from eight individual tracks, the consensus track was created

because they are more likely to be promoters; (ii) We required that
more than half of the tracks have non—zero values to call an enhan—
cer. This filtering removed the enhancers that were only supported
by one or very few experimental evidence. In other words, this cri—
terion ensured that there were multiple independent lines of experi—
mental evidence to support the annotation of an enhancer. (iii) We
removed the enhancers smaller than 50 bp. Using the above
approaches, we identified an atlas of 2 534 123 enhancers for 105
cell/tissue types (Table 1).

3.5 Validation using VISTA enhancer database

We next evaluated the performance of our approach. We extracted
tissue—specific enhancers from the VISTA database. For example,
809 and 96 validated enhancers were found for fetal brain and
heart. The other tissue types have very small number of enhancers
available and are not suitable for the validation. The enhancers
annotated in VISTA are grouped as a positive set. The union of the
peaks in all tracks is the entire prediction space and the regions not
overlapping with the positive set are considered as the negative set.
We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the consensus enhan—
cers in the unit of base pair. For heart enhancers, the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (AROC) for the consensus is 0.89,
while the AROC for individual tracks are all under 0.84, suggesting
that the consensus have the better enhancer annotation than any in—
dividual track. Because only binary data are available for the tracks
of ‘EP300’, ‘eRNA’ and ‘POL2’ in heart (Andersson et al., 2014;

Barrett et al., 2013), they do not have an ROC curve. They showed
quite good specificity (>0.95) relatively low sensitivity (<0.01) (Fig.
5A). Similar results were observed for brain enhancers (Fig. 5B). We
also compared the performance using voting approach in which
each track was assigned with uniform weight. The AROC for the
fetal brain and heart were 0.70 and 0.86 using uniform weight, re—
spectively, which were lower than the performance using our cross—
validation derived weights.

3.6 Enhancer—target gene relationships

We predicted the target genes of enhancers using a recent developed
algorithm, namely Integrated Method for Predicting Enhancer
Targets (IM—PET) (He et al., 2014). IM—PET predicts enhancer—
promoter by integrating four features using a Random Forest classi—
fier. Features are derived from transcriptomic, epigenomic and gen—
ome sequence data, including enhancer and promoter activity
correlation, TF and promoter activity correlation, enhancer and pro—
moter sequence co—evolution and enhancer—to—promoter distance.
The input data for enhancer—target prediction included the gene ex—
pression dataset (RNA—seq) and genomic positions of predicted en—
hancers, histone modification data for 48 cell lines and 22 tissues.
Overall, we predicted 2 488 394 enhancer—target relationships for
the 70 cell/tissue types. On average, one enhancer is associated with
2.4 target genes, and each gene is associated with 4.1 enhancers in
one cell/tissue type.

3.7 Web server

EnhancerAtlas is accessible to the research community in the web
server (http://www.enhanceratlas.org/). The database has the fol—
lowing features to facilitate the usage of enhancer annotation. First,
users are allowed to select a particular genomic region and examine
the consensus enhancers within the region. In the meantime, we also
show the experimental data (individual tracks) that support the con—
sensus. Second, users can identify the enhancers that associated with
a gene of interest. Similarly, both the consensus and all the experi—
mental tracks are shown. Third, users can compare the enhancers
across different cell/tissue types. Such comparison will allow users
to identify the enhancers that are conserved or specific to cell/tissue
types. Fourth, we allow users to upload their own custom data and
annotate the potential enhancers for their datasets.

Specifically, we designed six modules to facilitate the enhancer ana—
lysis within the EnhancerAtlas
This module would graphically display enhancers of any genomic re—
gion of interest in a selected cell/tissue type. The ‘consensus’ track sum—

marizes all information, while the individual tracks are the
experimental datasets from independent high—throughput approaches
(Fig. 6A). We also provide a link to the Epigenome browser (Zhou
et al., 2011) for an alternative display. (B) Search enhancers by gene
name. This module would graphically show the enhancers that are
associated with a given gene of interest in one special cell/tissue type.
Multiple input options are provided for the gene ID, including
Ensembl, EMBL, UCSC, PDB, RefSeq and UniProt (Fig. 6B). (C)
Compare enhancers across cell/tissues. Using this module, users could
easily compare the enhancers across multiple selected cell/tissue types

speciﬁc to the cell type or conserved in other cell types are marked
with different colors (Fig. 6E); (F) Predict target genes in defined gen—
omic regions. After a user has identified a set of potential cis—

can upload the regions in bed format and select the cell types that are
most relevant to the cell type of interest. This module will compare up—
loaded regions vvith the enhancers in the selected cell types and obtain
the target genes of the enhancers in these cell types. If some of the up—
loaded regions are in promoters, the module will also provide the
ﬂanking target genes of the regulatory regions (Fig. 6F).

4 Conclusions and discussions

In this work, we developed an unsupervised learning approach to
derive the consensus enhancers by integrating a variety of experi—
mental datasets. Application of the approach to 105 cell/tissue types
yielded an atlas of 2 488 394 enhancers. These consensus enhancers
were of better quality than individual dataset. To facilitate the usage
of the enhancer annotation, we developed EnhancerAtlas, an online
database, which is specifically designed for enhancer annotation and
analysis. A set of analytic tools was provided in the database.

We noticed that some tracks have relatively small weights such as
those for eRNAs and ChIA—PET. The main reasons are that eRNA sig—
nal often marks much less enhancers than other tracks and that the reso—
lution of ChIA—PET is often very low. On the other hand, it is not
completely surprising that eRNA and ChIA—PET have a much lower cor—
relation with such tracks, since eRNA and ChIA—PET capture a com—
pletely different layer of genome regulation. eRNAs typically mark
active enhancers, while other tracks might include all types of enhancers
including active and poised enhancers. In the future, we plan to classify
enhancers so that the eRNA information will be fully appreciated.

While the IM—PET method showed great performance, its effect—
iveness has not been tested across such a diverse collection of cell
types and tissues. Since it is a supervised model, the training cell
types may have a significant effect on the performance of the model
in different cell types. We used newly reported enhancer—promoter
interactions as the gold standard to assess the quality of our IM—PET
prediction (He et al., 2014). The performance of predictions in these
new cell types (AUC 0.9) are similar the predictions we evaluated in
the original IM—PET prediction (Figure S3).

Since enhancers only occupy a tiny fraction of genome, the number
of positive is much smaller than the number of negative. The imbalanced
data will yield an inﬂated estimation of the performance. However, we
are focusing on the relative performance by comparing the consensus
track and each individual track. Therefore, even though the absolute
AUC values might be overestimated, the relationship of relative per—
formance should still hold. An alternative measurement would be using
precision to estimate the performance. Because only a handful enhancers
were validated and vast majority of enhancers were not tested, those un—
tested enhancers are currently included in the negative set. Therefore,
many corrected predicted enhancers are called as false positive and thus
a deﬂated precision will be obtained. For example, the precision for the
consensus and EP300 tracks in fetal heart are 0.00093 and 0.00013, re—
spectively, which we do not believe reﬂect the quality of the datasets.

A comprehensive enhancer database is always a moving target.
Therefore, the database will be updated routinely as new datasets become
available. For example, recently several high—throughput enhancer screens
(e.g. STARR—seq) (Arnold et al., 2013) have been reported. Similarly,
more hi—C based datasets are also available for different cell types. We
plan to include these new data types in the next version of the database.

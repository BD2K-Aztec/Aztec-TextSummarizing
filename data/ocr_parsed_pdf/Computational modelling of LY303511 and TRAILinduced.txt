LY294002 (Gharbi et al., 2007; Jacobs et al., 2005), and is
related to the non—speciﬁc kinase inhibitor quercetin (Davies
et al., 2000). LY30 produces high levels of ROS (reactive
oxygen species), which may be particularly harmful to cancer
cells that have high metabolic rates and oxidative stress. Our
recent studies found a synergistic anti—cancer effect by combining
LY30 and TRAIL (Poh and Pervaiz, 2005; Poh et al., 2007;
Shenoy et al., 2009). Treating cells with low doses of TRAIL
plus with low doses of LY30 caused robust activation of the apop—
totic pathway, while treatment with either agent alone caused
minimal death.

We undertook the task of modelling the effects of LY30 in the
network of TRAIL—induced apoptosis, with the aim of evaluat—
ing whether the molecular effects known to be caused by LY30
were sufﬁcient to explain the synergy of the LY3(PTRAIL com—
bination. We were successful in using modelling to recapitulate
the synergistic levels of cell death that were observed. However,
the simulated activation kinetics of pro—apoptotic caspase en—
zymes along the pathway showed poor correlation with experi—
mental data. In particular, there were large mismatches between
simulation and experiment at early time points, particularly for
upstream regions of the pathway. This suggested further experi—
ments focusing on caspase—8 activation shortly after treatment.
New data revealed an even larger and more obvious mismatch
between simulation and experimental data: speciﬁcally, LY30
treatment had a brief inhibitory effect on caspase—8, 30min
after treatment. Finally, we modelled two sources of ROS that
might explain the effects of LY30 on caspase—8 activation, and
that might be relevant for other anti—cancer drugs.

2 METHODS

2.1 Cell and treatments

HeLa was purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA) and maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1%
S-penicillin. HeLa cells were plated at 0.125 million cells/well in 24-well
plates (and proportionally for other size plates) and grown overnight until
80% conﬂuent. All treatments with LY30 (Alexis, Switzerland) and
TRAIL (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) used the methods and
doses of (Poh et al., 2007); all combination treatments of LY30 and
TRAIL involved pre-incubation of cells with 25 nM LY30 for 1h
before adding 20 ng/ml TRAIL. Experiments with the superoxide scav-
enger Tiron (Sigma-Aldrich) applied 10 mM to cells 1h before adding
LY30. Experiments with the H202 scavenger catalase (C3511 catalase
from bovine liver, Sigma-Aldrich) used a dose of 2000 units/n11, added
1 day before treatment, then added again the next day for co-incubation
with LY30 after changing the medium. Treatments for supplementary
experiments are described in Supplementary Material 4.1.

2.2 Viability

After treatment with LY30, TRAIL or the combination for 24 h, cells
were washed with 1>< PBS, stained with crystal violet for 20 min, and
washed three times with pure water. For quantiﬁcation, crystal violet was
dissolved in 1% SDS with shaking for 1h, and then measured using
absorbance at 595nm with a Tecan microplate reader.

2.3 Caspase activity

HeLa cells, after the indicated treatments and incubations, were
harvested, washed with 1>< PBS, re-suspended in chilled cell lysis buffer

(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and incubated on ice for 10 min.
Caspase-3 and Caspase-S enzyme activities were assayed using 7-amino
triﬁuoromethylcoumarin and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-conjugated
substrates (BioMol) as reported previously (Poh et al., 2007).

2.4 SDS-PAGE and western blotting

Hela cells were grown in 60 mm Petri dishes until 80% conﬂuent, and
treated with LY30 for the indicated durations. Cells were harvested and
washed once with 1>< PBS before lysis using cell lysis buffer (150 mM
NaCl, TrisiHCl 7.4 and 1% Nonidet P40) with a cocktail of protease
inhibiors (1 mM PMSF, 10 ng/ml aprotinin, 20 ng/ml pepstatin A and
10 ng/ml leupeptin). 100 ng of cell lysate was then subjected to
SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel before being electro-
transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corporation,
Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dry
milk in TBST (TBS with 0.5% Tween20) and probed overnight at 4°C
with cFLIP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA,
USA). ﬁ-actin or GAPDH (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used as a loading control. Primary antibodies
were detected using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibo-
dies and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL
reagents from Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Densities were quantiﬁed
using Image J (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

2.5 Simulations

All biological events were modelled with ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) as elementary reactions with mass action kinetics. KroneckerBio
toolbox (Toettcher et al., 2010) in MATLAB (Polking, 1995) and Copasi
(Hoops et al., 2006) were used for simulating the ODE models. In the
TRAIL pathway model, synthesis and degradation effects were only
modelled for caspases. Degradation processes used ﬁrst-order reactions,
and protein synthesis used zeroth-order reactions, with synthesis rate as-
signed so that the initial concentrations of the Albeck model (Albeck
et al., 2008b) would be equal to the steady state of the model system
without TRAIL. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out with sample
size of 10000 cells with normal distributions of initial concentrations
(mean equal to the initial concentration in the Albeck model, and vari-
ance equal to 40% of the mean initial concentration). PLOT was used for
visualizing simulations. The comparison of relative caspase activity meas-
urements with simulations of absolute caspase numbers is described in
Supplementary Material 1.6.

2.6 Statistical analysis

All experiments were performed at least three times for statistical signiﬁ-
cance. Numerical data were expressed as mean :1: SD. Statistical analysis
was performed using the one-tailed paired Student’s t-test considering the
variances unequal. P values<0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Model construction for single and
combination treatments

3.1.1 Trail model To study the synergy between LY30 and
TRAIL, we adapted a previous model of TRAIL—induced apop—
tosis (Albeck et al., 2008b), and added reaction equations for
the impact of LY30 on the network. The Albeck model was
supported by extensive experimental measurements in HeLa
(cervical carcinoma) cells, but those experiments involved cyclo—
heximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. A lack of turnover
effects in the Albeck model means that even an insignificant

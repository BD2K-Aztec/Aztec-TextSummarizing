Note: The last column denotes the number of multi—contig scaffolds that contain breakpoints (i.e. scaffolds that do not admit a co—linear mapping to the reference). The

numbers in parenthesis denote the toml number of multi—contig scaffolds.

A novel feature of SCARPA is the ability to detect
misassembled contigs. Although this procedure may produce
false positives, SCARPA reports only a few such contigs
per dataset, which can be manually investigated if necessary.
For instance, SCARPA discards no contigs in the G.clavigera
and Assemblathonl datasets and only three contigs in
the Ecoli dataset, two of which are indeed found to
be erroneous.

E .coli 3 12 3 29 97
G.clavigera 9 l5 5 51 172
Assemblathonl 18 27 15 90 515

 

Note: Mapping is performed using Bowtie with 16 threads, and mapping time is
included for all scaffolders. For information, the total wall—clock time taken by
Bowtie to index the reference and write read mappings in SAM format is also
reported.

We also show that SCARPA has favorable running time on
these datasets, although it is slightly slower than SSPACE. In
addition, SCARPA has a small memory footprint, requiring
<2 GB on the Assemblathonl dataset.

Within SCARPA, the most time—consuming step is the contig
orientation task. While we believe our method typically produces
more accurate scaffolds compared with greedy— or heuristic—
based approach and has the advantage of detecting misassem—
blies, it can be computationally expensive for large and complex
genomes. On the other hand, the ﬁxed—parameter tractable algo—
rithm we use is suitable for parallel computation. Although our
current implementation is single—threaded, we plan to explore
this direction in a future version.

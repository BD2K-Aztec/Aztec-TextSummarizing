ABSTRACT

Motivation: Functional similarity between proteins is evident at
both the sequence and structure levels. SeSAW is a web-based
program for identifying functionally or evolutionarily conserved motifs
in protein structures by locating sequence and structural similarities,
and quantifying these at the level of individual residues. Results can
be visualized in 2D, as annotated alignments, or in 3D, as structural
superpositions. An example is given for both an experimentally
determined query structure and a homology model.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sequence alignment and structural alignment are widely used
techniques for inferring functional or evolutionary relationships
between proteins. However, most alignment methods do not
integrate sequence and structural information into one measure
of similarity or describe the similarity at the level of individual
residues. We recently introduced a sequence and structure-based
scoring method that employs sequence proﬁle—proﬁle comparisons,
but is anchored by structural alignments and showed that the
functional information associated with the top-scoring hits found
by the method agreed well with expert annotations published
in the literature (Standley et al., 2008b). Subsequently, we have
shown that this approach can be used to identify functional sites
in remote (e.g.10—20% sequence identity) homology models, even
when the structural template used to build the model is itself
un-annotated (Standley et al., 2008a). That is, a structure without
a known function (e.g. a structural genomics target) can be used
as an intermediate template to subsequently locate a functionally
Characterized structure, and thus map putative functional sites
onto a distantly related query sequence. Here, we describe a
web-based implementation of the method called SeSAW (sequence-
derived structural alignment weights) that can automatically perform
putative functional residue mapping. We emphasize that such
mapping is intended to guide subsequent experiments rather than
to serve as a substitute for experimental annotations.

2 ALGORITHM

SeSAW takes as input a PDB-formatted query ﬁle, Chain ID, and, in
the case of a template-based model, the PDB ID and Chain ID of the
template. As illustrated in Figure l, A PSI-BLAST position speciﬁc
scoring matrix (PSSM) for the query is retrieved or computed,
as necessary (we maintain a database of PSSMs for every unique
PDB Chain). The query is partitioned into unique structural domains
using SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995), CATH (Pearl et al., 2005) and
Protein Domain Parser (Alexandrov and Shindyalov, 2003). For
each domain, SeSAW attempts to construct a list of representative
structure neighbors by mapping from a pre-computed list of pairwise
structural alignments using PSI-BLAST; if this fails, SeSAW
performs direct structural alignment on the representative list using
ASH (Standley et al., 2007). The representative neighbors are then
expanded to include their sequence homologs. The resulting hits are
structurally aligned to the query and ranked by the SeSAW score.

SeSAW in protein functional mapping

 

The score is given by adding the ASH structure alignment score to
the sum of a per-residue similarity score:
NA
SSeSAW =SASH+ZSi (1)
i
where per-residue similarity score S,- is deﬁned as:

a
d

s,- = e ) (wBsB[aQ, aT] +wPMAX {sT[aQ],sQ[aT] }) (2)
Here, d is the distance between Cot atoms in the two aligned residues
(after superposition of the query and template), dmax is a reference
distance (4 A used on all calculations), wB is a scalar weight (0.8 used
in all calculations), S3 is the % bit Blosum62 matrix, aQ and aT are
the amino acid types of the query and template, respectively, W}: is
a scalar weight (1.5 used in all calculations), and ST and SQ are the
odds column vectors of the query and template PSSMs, respectively.
The SeSAW score is reported, along with a P-value computed by
numerically integrating the known distribution of scores. Functional
annotations, extracted regularly at the Protein Data Bank Japan, are
then mapped onto the query—template alignment.

3 VISUALIZATION

Query—template alignments, with residue-level functional des-
criptions, when available, are displayed with Jalview (Waterhouse
et al., 2009). Superpositions can be downloaded or visualized in 3D
with an interactive table of residues pairs that score highly according
to the per-residue similarity score.

4 EXAMPLES

The SeSAW method was used to ﬁnd templates related to the
hypothetical protein TTHA1568 from Thermus thermophilus HB8
(PDB identiﬁer 2czlA), a structural genomics target with unknown
ﬁmction (Standley et al., 2008b). The biochemical function of
TTHA1568 has subsequently been determined (Hiratsuka et al.,
2008). In our original work, while we were unable to pinpoint
the exact biochemical function, our analysis indicated a likely
active site near residues S57, T105 and T106, as well as a highly
signiﬁcant glycine (G82) that we proposed would act as a hinge,
allowing substrate access. These predictions are supported by recent
experimental evidence (Arai et al., 2009). This result is signiﬁcant
since the closest sequence homolog with known ﬁmction at the time
of our prediction, a glutamate transport protein, had a sequence
identity of only 15%.

The second example illustrates the use of SeSAW in annotating a
homology model. Zc3hl2a from Mus musculus is a protein that was
found to be required for mRNA stability of inﬂammatory cytokines.
Because of the very low sequence homology to known folds, a
number of models were built and submitted to SeSAW, and the
model with the highest raw score retained for further analysis. This
model was built on a structural genomics target of unknown ﬁmction
(PDB ID 2qipA). The top two SeSAW hits to this model were to a
Mg-dependent hydrolase (2ho4B) and a Mg-dependent phosphatase
(lkle). From these hits, a cluster of conserved aspartic acids that
bind Mg could be identiﬁed in the query. The second highest hit was
to the nuclease domain of the Taq DNA polymerase (ltauA). These
three hits are consistent with a possible Mg-dependent ribonuclease
function, and this prediction was subsequently demonstrated in vitro
and in vivo; moreover, when we mutated one of the predicted

Mg-binding aspartic acids to asperagine, the nuclease activity was
abolished, conﬁrming the predicted active site location (Matsushita
et al., 2009).

These two examples are typical of SeSAW results when only
very low sequence homologs exist. More recently, SeSAW was
used to correctly identify the dual (Ser/Thr or Tyr) speciﬁcity of
the kinase ROP16 from Toxoplasma gondii using a more modest
(20%) homology model, while sequence analysis alone indicated
greater similarity to Ser/T hr kinases (Yamamoto et al., 2009). The
structural alignment step allows very distantly related templates to
be recognized, while the use of proﬁle—proﬁle sequence comparison
highlights the residue pairs that are mutually conserved. However,
not all such residues are expected to be part of the active site;
structurally important amino acids such as proline and some large
hydrophobic groups often score highly as well. Another limitation of
SeSAW is that, in difﬁcult cases such as these, the exact biochemical
function is not automatically revealed, although residues that
make up the active site can often be located. Prediction of the
biochemical role of the protein requires some investigation and,
ultimately, biochemical experimentation. Nevertheless, SeSAW is
a signiﬁcant improvement over running structural and sequence
analysis separately (Standley et al., 2008b), and can thus play
an important role in automated functional annotation of structural
genomics targets or homology models.

Abstract

Motivation: Genome—wide mapping of chromatin states is essential for defining regulatory elem—
ents and inferring their activities in eukaryotic genomes. A number of hidden Markov model
(HMM)—based methods have been developed to infer chromatin state maps from genome—wide his—
tone modification data for an individual genome. To perform a principled comparison of evolution—
arily distant epigenomes, we must consider species—specific biases such as differences in genome
size, strength of signal enrichment and co—occurrence patterns of histone modifications.

Results: Here, we present a new Bayesian non—parametric method called hierarchically linked infin—
ite HMM (hiHMM) to jointly infer chromatin state maps in multiple genomes (different species,
cell types and developmental stages) using genome—wide histone modification data. This flexible
framework provides a new way to learn a consistent definition of chromatin states across multiple
genomes, thus facilitating a direct comparison among them. We demonstrate the utility of this
method using synthetic data as well as multiple modENCODE ChlP—seq datasets.

Conclusion: The hierarchical and Bayesian non—parametric formulation in our approach is an
important extension to the current set of methodologies for comparative chromatin landscape
analysis.

are associated with different covalent modifications of histone pro—
teins across various organisms (Kharchenko et (11., 2011; Liu et (11.,
2011; Mikkelsen et (11., 2007; Park, 2009; Roudier et (11., 2011). For
example, H3K4me3 (trimethylation of histone H3 at residue lysine
4) marks active promoters, H3K4me1 marks enhancers, H3K36me3
marks transcribed gene bodies, H3K27me3 marks polycomb—
repressed regions and H3K9me3 marks heterochromatin. Although
there are theoretically up to 2” possible combinations of n histone
modifications at any given locus in the genome, in practice we only
observe a small number of distinct dominant combinations, thus giv—
ing rise to the concept of chromatin states (Ernst and Kellis, 2010;
Filion et (11., 2010; Heintzman et (11., 2009; Hon et (11., 2008;
Kharchenko et (11., 2011; Liu et (11., 2011; Mikkelsen et (11., 2007;
Roudier et (11., 2011), in which each state consists of a combination
of histone modifications.

A key idea underlying chromatin state analysis is to computa—
tionally identify the number and composition of chromatin states in
the genome based on multiple genome—wide profiles of histone
modifications and to annotate the genome with these chromatin
states. These states were found to be strongly correlated with vari—
ous functional genomic features such as promoters, actively tran—
scribing gene bodies, enhancers and heterochromatins. Although
many chromatin states are common across different cell types or
organisms, there are indeed clear examples of cell—type—specific chro—
matin states consisting of unique co—occurrence of histone modifica—
tions. The H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent promoter state that is
prevalent in embryonic stem cells but mostly absent from terminally
differentiated cells is such an example (Bernstein et (11., 2006).
Investigating co—occurrence of multiple histone marks facilitates the
differentiation of more subtle features in chromatin state, such as
identifying tissue—specific strong and weak enhancer regions (Ernst
et (11., 2011) and changes in co—occurrence patterns between evolu—
tionarily distant species (H0 at 111., 2014). Therefore, a chromatin
state map is a powerful means to infer potential genome function in
a systematic and automated fashion. In conjunction with transcrip—
tomic, DNase I and transcription factor binding data, chromatin
state analysis was used to infer putative biochemical functions to a
large fraction of the non—coding genomic regions (ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2012).

Various machine learning algorithms, such as ChromHMM
(Ernst and Kellis, 2012), Segway (Hoffman et (11., 2012), TreeHMM
(Biesinger et (11., 2013) and tiered HMM (Larson et (11., 2013), have
been developed to generate such maps to facilitate cell type—specific
genome annotations in a systematic and automated fashion. All of
them are based on probabilistic graphical models such as the hidden
Markov model (HMM) and dynamic Bayesian network. One essen—
tial task for these algorithms is to learn the prominent combination
of histone modifications. Similar to any clustering problem, it is
often difficult to identify a reasonable number of combinations that
can adequately capture the major variation in the data. One possibil—
ity is to estimate the adequate number of states by performing ex—
ploratory analysis such as the principal component analysis
(Julienne et (11., 2013). Another common approach is to run the
HMM learning multiple times with varying state numbers and iden—
tify the best fitting model using measures such as the Bayesian
Information Criterion. The inferred states do not necessarily have a
one—to—one correspondence with distinct functional regions in the
chromatin, but they do give a very good data—driven description of
the chromatin that can act as a starting point for further bioinfor—
matics and experimental analysis (Baker, 2011). Therefore, it is
still of great interest to develop principled methods for identifying
chromatin states within and across multiple genomes.

The cross—species chromatin state comparison problem was
motivated by a recent model organism encyclopedia of DNA elem—
ents (modENDCODE) project that aims to systematically compare
chromatin organization in Homo sapiens (human), Drosophila
melanogaster (ﬂy) and Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) (H0 at 111.,
2014). A naive approach to this problem would be to compute the
state map for each organism separately and then try to compare
them afterward. However, this causes significant problems for inter—
pretation because what was defined as an enhancer state in one
organism is likely not identical with that from another organism.
In the other extreme, we could simply concatenate the three gen—
omes into one and infer states, but then the inferred result would be
highly biased by the species with the largest genome size or by other
species—specific biases in the ChIP—seq signals. Similar problems
exist when comparing multiple developmental stages or cell types in
the same organism. In essence, we require a method that allows
the information of the state definition to be shared across multiple
genomes while retaining the ability for each genome to have its own
chromatin state definition.

In the context of that project, we developed a novel Bayesian
non—parametric method, called hierarchically linked infinite HMM
(hiHMM), to infer chromatin state maps across multiple genomes
simultaneously. The application of hiHMM in the human/ﬂy/worm
cross—species comparison setting indicates that the chromatin state
segmentations in individual organisms generated by hiHMM are
highly comparable to the maps generated by ChromHMM (Ernst
and Kellis, 2010, 2012) and Segway (Hoffman et (11., 2012)—two
widely used chromatin state segmentation algorithms (H0 at 111.,
2014). Furthermore, hiHMM is designed to address species—specific
confounding factors such as variations in ChIP signal strength,
genome size and co—occurrence patterns. In this article, we will
present the method in detail as well as demonstrating the utility of
this method using a variety of simulated and real data.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Statistical model for joint chromatin state inference
To address the problem of inferring consistent chromatin state def—
inition across multiple related genomes, we employ an infinite
HMM (iHMM) (Beal et (11., 2002), a non—parametric extension of a
finite state HMM, as a base model and extend it to model data from
multiple conditions. For ease of model description, we consider the
problem of chromatin state segmentation on multi—species histone
modification data, in which case multiple conditions correspond to
multiple species. The same statistical model can be used to describe
data from different types of conditions such as multiple developmen—
tal stages or cell types.

2.1.1 Background on chromatin state segmentation using HMM

We begin our model description by introducing the traditional
HMM for single species data. Let Y : (yl, ...,yT) be an m X T
matrix for histone modification data for m chromatin marks
measured at T contiguous locations along the genome. Each yt :
(ylt, ...,ymt)T E Rm corresponds to the observation data at gen—
omic location t. In a traditional HMM assuming K hidden states,
each genomic location t is associated with a hidden chromatin state
5, E {1, . . . ,K} from which the observation data yt is generated. We
assume that yt follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution condi—
tioned on its hidden state 5, such that ytlst ~ N(usl,251) for pk E R“
and 2k 6 IRme for k : 1, .. . ,K. The parameter it), corresponds to
the mean signal strengths from state [2 for m marks. The transition

probabilities between hidden states are defined by the transition ma—
trix n E IRKXK such that p(stlst_1) : 115,715,. The segmentation by the
chromatin states then can be naturally obtained from the hidden
state sequence S : (s1, ...,sT). The hidden state sequence can be
inferred by the Viterbi algorithm (Forney, 1973).

2.1.2 Extension to hiHMM

To obtain a consistent state definition for principled comparison of
chromatin states between multiple species, we propose to model the
multi—species data by using an iHMM as a base model for each spe—
cies data and then by coupling species—specific iHMM parameters
together, so that state definition can be shared across species.

Under an iHMM (Beal et (11., 2002; Teh et (11., 2006), an infinite
number of hidden states is assumed a priori, and then the number of
hidden states is inferred by posterior inference from given data. An
infinite dimensional transition matrix 11 and an infinite number of
emission parameters of u), and Elk for k : 1, 2, . . . are defined as fol—
lows. Each row 11;, of the transition matrix follows the so—called
Dirichlet process (DP), which defines a probability distribution on a
countably infinite dimensional space of {1,2,  (Blackwell and
MacQueen, 1973; Ferguson, 1973). Formally, we have it), ~ DP(oco,
B) where B is the base measure (‘mean’ of the DP) and 0:0 is a scale
parameter controlling the concentration around the base measure.
To couple each row of the transition matrix, so that the state defin—
ition can be shared across rows, a common base measure B of an—
other DP is used, which we denote B N GEM(y) for a hyper—
parameter y under a stick—breaking process [for more details, refer
to Teh et al. (2006)]. For each state [2, the emission parameter p), is
sampled from a prior probability H, which we assume to be a nor—
mal distribution N (0, 20 ), where 20 is the initial covariance matrix.

In addition to the ﬂexibility of allowing an infinite number of
states a priori, an iHMM has the advantage that it naturally extends
to a more general model in which multiple iHMMs can be coupled
together. Suppose we have chromatin data from multiple, say C,
species. Let c E {1, ...,C} denote the species indicator. Random
variables 5:6) and y)” represent the hidden state and the observation
data, respectively, at locus t in species c. We associate each species
data with its own transition matrix 11(5), such that each row of 11(5)
follows the same DP across different rows and different species.
Two versions of emission parameters are considered—one that as—
sumes a species—specific emission matrix (Model 1) and the other
assuming a common emission matrix across species (Model 2). The
generative model for Model 1 can be formulated as follows:

I} ~ GEMW)
1:26) ~ DP(O€0, 

salsa ~ 14::

121

#5:) ~H:N(0,Eo) (1)
yids?) ~ N092) (2)

51

For simplicity, we may assume 20 : 6%11 and E : 6211 for real—
valued 6% and 62 and an identity matrix I. The formulation for
Model 2 is similar to the equations above except that Equations (1)
and (2) are replaced by:

M N N(0720)

VIC) ISIC) N N (#5:) 7 2)

Note that the parameters are more tightly coupled in Model 2 than
in Model 1 in which species—specific parameters are weakly coupled

through a prior. We denote the proposed model as a hiHMM.
A similar formulation that extends an iHMM to handle multi—
population data was first introduced with application to the local
ancestry estimation problem (Sohn et (11., 2012) but with a different
emission model and for a different data type.

2.1.3 Explicit control for self-transition probability

Dependencies among neighboring genomic locations may be better
reﬂected by introducing an explicit self—transition probability. To
implement this idea, we modify the transition probability as follows:

Pet) 2 kisii). 21') 2 pram + <1 — 125%}?

where 17);) denotes the self—transition probability in species c, and
1(k, /) : 1 if k : j and 0 otherwise. We expect this model to prevent
the excessive transitions between locations and to help accommo—
date different genome sizes and the resulting self—transition probabil—
ities between species. The graphical representation for the final
model is shown in Figure 1.

2.1.4 Posterior inference

We employ a dynamic—programming technique called Beam sam—
pling (Van Gael et (11., 2008) for efficient posterior inference dealing
with an infinite number of hidden states. It adaptively changes the
number of states over iterations, so at each iteration, it tries to in—
crease the state space, and based on the new parameters with
increased number of states, the hidden state sequence is sampled.
Then we check whether there is a hidden state having no associ—
ation. We remove those states from our state space. On the basis of
this new hidden state sequence, we re—sample HMM parameters.

We repeat this until L,-, the mean of the last m posterior samples at
1th iteration, converges. That is, the convergence criteria is
IL,- — L,-_1I/IL,-_1I < 1.0 X 10‘5. The other iHMM parameters and
the self—transition probabilities are inferred by Gibbs sampling.

2.1.5 Parameter initialization

Like most HMM—based learning methods, using good initial param—
eters is important in obtaining good learning outcome. To obtain
reasonable initial emission and transition matrices, we first concat—
enate all genomes together and perform a k—mean clustering step.
This also encourages coupling of emission matrices in different spe—
cies in case of Model 1.

2.2 Simulations

2.2.1 Simulation scenarios

We first demonstrate the main benefit of the proposed models on
simulated datasets. The simulation scenarios are mainly motivated
by a recent modENCODE project that compares the chromatin or—
ganization in human, fly and worm to reveal common and species—
specific chromatin states (H0 at 111., 2014). We simulated histone
modification data with M : 8 marks from C : 3 species
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The transition matrix and the emission
parameters are simulated under various scenarios below. Non—zero
elements in the emission matrix correspond to the enriched marks.
At each parameter setting, a hidden state sequence and the corres—
ponding observation sequence of length T is generated under the
standard HMM model per species, and this is repeated 50 times.

We describe the default simulation setting for the HMM param—
eters first. For each state [2 among the assumed K hidden states, one or
two histone marks are randomly chosen to have non—zero signal for
all the species. The average signal strength 5km of each enriched mark
m in state [2 is randomly sampled from uniform distribution U(1, 4)
for k: 1, ...,K— 1 and from U(0.05,1) for sz to simulate a
chromatin state with low signal. As the dynamic range of ChIP—seq
signal may not be identical across species due to technical differences,
we further incorporate a discrepancy parameter p, such that the signal
strength for the mark in species c is defined as 11);; : skm if c : 1 and
11);; : 5),”,(1 + (—1)(C_1)p) for c 2 2. We keep p relatively small com—
pared with the average signal strength in U(1, 4); p : 0.1 in most
scenarios below except for one scenario to examine the performance
behavior with respect to p. Finally, we set one state as species specific
by making one of the enriched marks at the state as un—enriched (i.e.
signal strength of zero) for species c 2 2. The transition parameter is
defined as 11(5) : ngIIIK + (1 — pgc))ngc), where 11);) : no + 115, no is a
random sparse matrix with 30% of randomly uniformly distributed
non—zero elements and constant across species and n5 is a random
sparse matrix with 10% of non—zero elements, which are species—
specifically sampled. We normalize each row of 11(5) to have row—sum
of one. IIK is an identity matrix of size K X K. We fix K at 10.

Scenario I: We examine the effect of different genome size. The
following three settings are considered in which either the genome
size T or the self—transition probability p0 varies between species.
We fix p at 0.1.

' Scenario I—1: The same genome size of T : (2000,2000,2000),
for each of the three species, and the same average self—transition
probability po 2 (0.9, 0.9,0.9).

' Scenario I—2: Different genome size of T : (2000, 5000, 10000)
and the same self—transition probability in : (0.9, 0.9, 0.9).

' Scenario I—3: Different genome size T : (2000,5000, 10000)
and different self—transition probability in : (0.7, 0.8, 0.9).

Scenario II: We study the effect of different ChIP—seq signal
strength across species. We vary p from 0.1 to 0.5 by step size of
0.2. The genome size and the self—transition probability were the
same as those in scenario I—1 in which the genome size and the self—
transition probabilities are the same across species.

Scenario III: The effect of the number of species—specific states is
studied in this scenario. We vary the number of species—specific
states 71 from 0 to 2. The other parameters were the same as in scen—
ario I—1.

2.2.2 Performance comparison

We compare the hiHMM Model 1 (hiHMM1) and Model 2
(hiHMM2) with an iHMM combined with the self—transition model
introduced in section 2.1.3 (iHMM+p0) that assumes a common
emission matrix and a common transition matrix for all species, the
iHMM without such additional self—transition model (iHMM), so
that transition probabilities are defined as P(s)c) : klsii : j) : it)?
and the existing methods of ChromHMM and Segway. In hiHMM
1 and hiHMM2, we set the initial number of states K0 as 7, the vari—
ance parameters of 62 : 1 and 6% : 1. The traditional HMMs with
K: 10, 13, 16 states are also compared for which a Matlab toolbox
for HMM written by K. Murphy was used in its default setting
(http: //www . cs . ubc . ca/murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm . html)
except that the full covariance matrix is assumed. In all cases other
than hiHMM1 and hiHMM2, genomes from different species were
concatenated as one sequence and used as input.

The segmentation performance is compared in two main aspects:
the accuracy of clustering genomic loci by hidden state labels and
the segment boundary detection accuracy. We use the adjusted Rand
Index (RI) for the former, and the F—measure computed from preci—
sion and recall for the latter. RI (Rand, 1971) is a traditional meas—
ure for clustering accuracy and considers the number of pairs of
samples whose labels are correctly assigned, that is the number of
pairs that are in the same (or different) cluster (i.e. the same hidden
state) both under the ground truth and under the estimated labels.
The adjusted RI is the normalized difference of the RI and its ex—
pected value under the null hypothesis, so that the expected value of
two random partitions becomes zero (Hubert and Arabie, 1985).

For segment boundary detection accuracy, precision is defined as
the number of true boundaries among detected boundaries divided
by the total number of detected boundaries, and recall is the number
of true boundaries among detected boundaries divided by the total
number of true boundaries. F measure is the harmonic mean of preci—
sion and recall, that is, F : 2(precision - recall) / (precision + recall).

2.3 Real data applications
2.3.1 Running hiHMM on ﬂy and worm ChIP-seq data
The ﬂy (genome assembly version dm3) and worm (genome assem—
bly version WS220) ChIP—seq and RNA—seq data were generated by
modENCODE consortia. All input—normalized ChIP—seq signal
tracks were downloaded from the ENCODE—X interactive faceted
browser: http://encode—x.med.harvard.edu/data_sets/chromatin/.
The original ﬂy and worm ChIP—seq data were in 10—bp resolution.
All tracks were re—binned to 100 bp resolution by taking the mean of
10 consecutive bins. Data from multiple histone modifications were
concatenated as columns into a tab—delimited format. Bins that
overlapped unmappable regions were removed (mappability re—
gions were downloaded from https://www.encodeproject.org/
comparative/chromatin/#mappability).

hiHMM was run in Matlab with default parameters: 200 burn—
in iterations, which means the first 200 samples, are discarded

during iterations for posterior inference and then 10 consecutive
posterior samples are collected to produce the final Maximum—
A—Posterior output. For each comparison, all available histone
modification profiles produced by ChIP—seq experiments that are
common across the targeted species and cell types were used
(Supplementary Table S1). Chromatin states were trained on repre—
sentative ﬂy chromosomes 2L, 2LHet, X and XHet and worm
chromosomes II, III and X, as per the modENCODE study
(H0 at 111., 2014). Our prior experience suggests that training with
all or only this representative subset of chromosomes in these organ—
isms make very little difference in terms of the resulting chromatin
state definition. Nonetheless, the hiHMM program is scalable to
analyze all the chromosomes—which would be useful for exploring
any previously uncharacterized chromatin landscapes.

Emission matrices from hiHMM output were examined and
states were named based on chromatin state definitions in previous
studies as well as overlap with expressed or unexpressed genes
(Ernst et (11., 2011; Kharchenko et (11., 2011) (Supplementary
Figs. S2 and S3). A custom R script is used to rename the states and
re—introduce unmappable regions as State 0.

2.3.2 Chromatin state statistics

Genomic coverage was calculated as the percentage of the mappable
genome that is occupied by each state, at the bin level. Expression
odds ratio was calculated as the ratio of the number of expressed ver—
sus silent genes that overlapped with each chromatin state, divided
by the genome—wide ratio of the number of expressed versus silent
genes. A gene was considered expressed if its mRNA expression lev—
els were >1 RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads).
Gene body overlap was calculated as the percentage of bins anno—
tated to each chromatin state that occur between the transcription
start site (TSS) and transcription end site (TES) of an annotated gene.

2.3.3 Meta-gene chromatin state enrichment profile

A meta—gene matrix was constructed from all annotated protein cod—
ing genes that were at least 1300 bp in length and do not overlap an—
other gene within 500 bp of its TSS or TES. Protein—coding gene
annotation was downloaded from https://www.encodeproject.org/
comparative/transcriptome/. We further excluded genes that
occurred within 1000bp of a chromosome start or end. The meta—
gene matrix contains the chromatin state annotations of each ‘repre—
sentative’ gene extending to 500 bp upstream of the TSS and 500 bp
downstream of the TES. Enrichment profiles are presented as heat—
maps where the color indicates the percentage of genes that have
been annotated with that particular chromatin state at that relative
genomic position. Meta—gene profiles of expressed and silent genes
were computed separately.

2.3.4 Inter-sample chromatin state co-occurrence

Fold change was calculated as the observed number of bins that
transitioned between any two chromatin state annotations divided
by the expected number. The expected number was the mean num—
ber of bin transitions between those two states in 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations with a randomized chromatin state assignment, preserv—
ing the relative genomic coverage of each state. Fold change was
truncated between one and five for simplified visualization and
interpretation.

2.3.5 Co-occurrence matrices
Co—occurrence of genomic chromatin state annotation between ex—
periments was calculated as the number of bins that were annotated

as a particular chromatin state combination in two experiments div—
ided by the total number of bins annotated to those states in the re—
spective experiments. This gives a value between 0 and 1, which is
presented in a heatmap.

2.3.6 Gene ontology enrichment of target genes in a region

Official gene symbols for all genes that overlapped with the selected
regions were submitted to the DAVID bioinformatics tool (Huang
et (11., 2009). The Benjamini adjusted P value (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995) of the 10 most significant gene ontology (GO) bio—
logical process results are presented for each analysis.

3 Result

3.1 Simulation study

3.1.1. An illustrative example

We compare the true simulated emission matrices and the estimated
ones by each algorithm on an example dataset with K : 10 chroma—
tin states model (Fig. 2). The true model contains two species—spe—
cific states (State 5 and State 9) that have species—specific mark
combinations. Therefore, the actual number of distinct chromatin
states across all the species can be viewed as 12. The genome size T
was 2000, 5000 and 10 000 for each of the three species.

As shown in Figure 2, Model 1 recovers the correct number of
hidden states and the correct mark combination. Model 2 recovers
one species—specific state correctly (State 9 in a cyan box Fig. 2), but
it misses the mark combination of the species—1—specific State 5
(green box in Fig. 2), possibly due to the shorter genome length of
species 1, resulting in lower overall representation of the state during
joint learning. Instead, two states corresponding to State 1 are re—
covered with slightly different signal strengths. This appears to hap—
pen because the average signal strength is not identical between
species. In contrast, Model 1 correctly recovers all the states as it
allows species—specific emission matrix that can have different signal
strength.

The standard HMMs fail to recover species—specific states even
when a large K of 16 was assumed. For example, although the signal
of the second mark in State 5 for species 1 is relatively strong, stand—
ard HMMs either miss the state completely (the case of K: 10) or
the recovered signal is very weak (cases of K: 13, 16). Again, this
seems to be because of the shorter genome size of species 1 and its
relatively low coverage. Moreover, State 9 in species 2 is completely
missing in all cases of K : 10, 13, 16 possibly because it is specific to
species 2 and its coverage is very low (1.7%). In summary, a stand—
ard HMM fails to recover the correct states, likely due to the exist—
ence of species—specific states, different genome size and possibly
different ChIP—seq signal range.

3.1.2 Comparison of segmentation accuracy

The overall performance over 50 simulated datasets per parameter
setting across scenarios is compared in terms of the adjusted RI be—
tween the true state labels and the estimated ones, and the segment
boundary detection accuracy of F—measure. Figure 3 shows boxplots
for the accuracy of each algorithm (Fig. 3A: scenario I, B: scenario
II, C: scenario III).

Both Model 1 (hiHMM1) and Model 2 (hiHMM2) perform su—
perior or comparable to the other algorithms across all the scen—
arios. HMM with K: 13 or 16 in which the assumed number of
states is larger than the true number of states consistently perform
the worst especially in terms of F—measure for the boundary detec—
tion accuracy. The traditional HMMs and ChromHMM tend to

Fig. 2. An illustrative example using a toy simulated dataset. The heatmaps
show the emission parameters of the ground truth with K210 chromatin
states in three species (top panel) and the hiHMM and HMM estimated par-
ameters. As State 5 (green box) and State 9 (cyan box) have different combin-
ations of enriched marks between species, the number of distinct chromatin
states across all the species is 12. Model 1 recovers the correct number of
states and the enriched marks. Model 2 recovered one of the two species-spe-
cific state but missed the species-1-specific State 5. The standard HMMs miss
three states even when a large K is assumed

over—segment the genome and produce a large number of false—posi—
tive segment boundaries, resulting in low precision. When compar—
ing hiHMM1 and hiHMM2, their performances are comparable
overall in both aspects. When the signal strength variation p is low,
hiHMM2 outperforms hiHMM1 in terms of clustering accuracy
(e.g. P value of 0.02 from a paired t—test in case of scenario 11—1), but
as the discrepancy increases, hiHMM1 significantly outperforms
hiHMM2 with a P value<2.2 X 1016 (Fig. 3B). We find that the
performance change of each algorithm is the most dominant in scen—
ario II for which the signal strength variation p is changed.

Regarding computation time, hiHMM1 or hiHMM2 each took
less than 2 min on average per simulation dataset (scenario I—1) in a
single Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5—2650 (8—core, 2.00 GHZ) with
32 GB RAM (DDR3, 1600 MHz) and CentOS 6.4 (64—bit architec—
ture), which is shorter than that from Segway (around 3 ~4min)
but longer than that from ChromHMM (<1 min).

3.2 Real data analysis

3.2.1 Case study 1: hiHMM identifies species-specific chromatin
states in ﬂy and worm

The analogous developmental stage of stage 3 larva (L3) in ﬂy and
worm was selected for this cross—species chromatin state analysis.
hiHMM was run using 25 starting states with Models 1 and 2 on
the combined data and 30 starting states using Model 2 to capture
more species—specific states.

Chromatin state analysis of ﬂy L3 versus worm L3 shows both
shared and unique patterns of chromatin mark co—occurrence be—
tween the two species (Fig. 4A). We found 25 states that grouped
into six categories: promoters, enhancers, gene body, heterochroma—
tin, repressed and low signal. Most states are conserved and have

similar compositions but with some clear differences. Fly promoter
states (red) show a distinct lack of H3K23ac when compared with
worm (green highlight in Fig. 4A). Conversely, worm promoter
states lack H3K79me1 when compared with ﬂy (BLACK highlight
in Fig. 4A). Genic and transcription states (green) in ﬂy show enrich—
ment of H4K16ac, H3K79me1 and H4K20me1, all of which are
largely absent in the same states in worm (orange highlight in
Fig. 4A). H4K8ac, on the other hand, is enriched in these states in
worm but completely absent in ﬂy (yellow highlight in Fig. 4A).
Further differences are visible in the repressed (purple) and hetero—
chromatin (black) states. In ﬂy, there is a clear differentiation of re—
pressive histone modifications between the two state classes,
whereas the marks consistently co—occur in worm (purple highlight
in Fig. 4A). To verify that these differences were representative of
the data and not simply training errors, we examined the data in a
genome browser and visually confirmed the differences
(Supplementary Figs. S4—S6).

To compare the performance of hiHMM Model 15 and 2, we also
learned a shared chromatin state definition using Model 2
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Increasing the number of states from 25 to
30 allowed for the identification of a greater number of species—specific
states, apparent from an absence of the state (0 genomic coverage)
in one species (Supplementary Fig. S8). When examining the state
co—occurrence matrix between the two models, there are obvious
anomalies in species—specific states 10 and 12 (Supplementary Fig. S9).

3.2.2 Case study 2: hiHMM identifies developmental stage-specific
loci in ﬂy

Three ﬂy developmental stages were chosen for chromatin state
comparison: late embryo (EL), third instar larvae (L3) and adult
head (AH). hiHMM was run on the combined datasets using
25 starting states with Models 1 and 2.

Jointly learned average ChIP signal matrices for three developmen—
tal stages in ﬂy show that the majority of observed histone modifica—
tion combinations and their genomic occurrence remain stable during
development (Supplementary Figs. S10 and S11). H3K79me1, how—
ever, shows a marked reduction in enrichment in active states in AH
compared with EL and L3 stages (Supplementary Fig. S12). Although
this difference is interesting, it is secondary to our ensuing analysis of
differential state co—occurrence during development. Examining the
co—occurrence between Models 1 and 2 shows a very high level of con—
cordance, so we continue the analysis using the shared chromatin state
definition learned by Model 2 (Supplementary Fig. S13).

Using these chromatin state maps, we implemented an unbiased
approach for identifying developmentally regulated genes from chro—
matin state co—occurrence between two developmental stages—EL
and AH—in ﬂy (Fig. 5). In total, 1659 genes from regions that transi—
tioned from an active (promoter, enhancer, gene) state in EL to an in—
active (repressed, heterochromatin, low signal) state in AH (Fig. 5C,
top right) were strongly enriched for multiple developmental GO
terms, including ‘Respiratory system development’ (P value
1.66 X 1078) (Fig. 5D). Similarly, 1889 genes that changed from in—
active in EL to active in AH (Fig. 5C, bottom left) were strongly en—
riched for terms expected from a fully developed organism, including
‘Transmission of nerve impulse’ (P value 1.48 X 1077). These transi—
tions in developmental regulation are clearly visible in a genome
browser when the chromatin state tracks are visualized (Fig. SE).

4 Discussion

The main innovation of our approach is that it provides a ﬂexible
framework to enable information sharing between multiple HMMs.

The main difficulty of joint analysis of related datasets is how to ob—
tain a consistent state definition or the mapping between a set of
states defined in one species and the one in another species. If one
were to apply iHMM separately on each of the datasets, we face the
problem of mapping state definitions between species. The proposed
hiHMM solves this problem by assuming a common state space def—
inition across all the datasets. It is one of the main advantages of
using the non—parametric model based on the so—called hierarchical
DP, which is the core component of iHMM. Under a hierarchical
DP prior for data from multiple groups, each group is associated
with a group—specific DP and then those DPs share a common base
measure that is another DP. This is the major mechanism how the
atoms from each DP can be shared across groups. Model 1 couples

the state definition more loosely than Model 2 since in Model 1 in—
formation is shared via the prior only, whereas Model 2 explicitly
employs a shared emission matrix.

One distinguishing feature of hiHMM is that we can jointly infer
emission values for genomes of differing lengths without the domi—
nating inﬂuence of a longer genome on the result or the need to per—
form compensatory subsampling during training. This is a major
limitation of existing methods that concatenate multiple samples for
joint learning that is overcome using hiHMM.

Similar to Segway or the HMM approach of Kharchenko et al.
(2011), hiHMM directly models continuous ChIP signal values and
therefore alleviate the need of selecting a binary threshold cutoff.
We observe that this feature is potentially important for

interesting and diverse characteristics we observe in low signal states
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

Both our simulated and real data analyses show that the advan—
tages of Model 1 become more evident when the data discrepancy
across different conditions is large, for example, in the case of multiple
species data. In terms of revealing interesting biology, the ability to
infer sample—specific emission matrix parameters (as in Model 1)
allows for intuitive and detailed comparison of chromatin mark com—
binations between different species or cell types. This is evident from
our 25 state analyses in ﬂy versus worm in case study 1. In addition to
the finding that ﬂy and worm have different chromatin modifications
compositions in heterochromatin, here we observed several previously
unreported differences between the two species as described above,
most notably the relative depletion of H3K23ac and enrichment of
H3K79me1 in ﬂy promoter states, as well as multiple differences in
the transcription states. Model 1 was also useful in identifying the un—
expected changes in the distribution of H3K79me1 during ﬂy develop—
ment. Many of these observations were not possible in previous
studies that did not include these marks in their comparison

(Supplementary Fig. S14), and they may suggest different mechanisms
of genetic regulation between the two species.

Jointly learned and shared emission matrix parameters (as gener—
ated by Model 2) provide an easily interpretable platform on which
to compare multiple samples from the same genome without the
confounding factor of different state definitions. Additionally,
Model 2 enjoys better statistical properties such as faster conver—
gence and shorter running time, so Model 2 would be a better choice
when the discrepancy between genomes is expected to be relatively
small as in the case of different developmental stages or environmen—
tal conditions in a single species.

By applying hiHMM to this newly compiled dataset, we were
able to identify two previously uncharacterized chromatin states
that we have named ‘Repressed’ states in the ﬂy development ana—
lysis (states 17 and 1 8 in Fig. 4A). These two states combined consti—
tute roughly 18% of the ﬂy genome and are almost exclusively
characterized by marks that were not profiled in previous studies,
and so these states were missed.

Although hiHMM allows learning the optimal number of states
from the data in principle, the likelihood surface of the model over

the used parameter space is quite ﬂat. Therefore, similar posterior
probability value can be obtained through different parameter value
combinations, and this makes the recovery of the correct number of
states still challenging. For systematic analysis of this issue, we
examined the effect on the accuracy and the number of inferred
states of three hyper—parameters: the initial number of states K0 and
the two variance parameters: 6% in the prior distribution for the
emission matrix and 62 for generating the observation signal given
the hidden state and the emission matrix (Supplementary Figs. S15
and S16 for Model 1 and Model 2, respectively). The smaller 62
produced better segmentation accuracy, which is expected as the
variance in the emission model should be small enough to assign the
observation signal to the correct state. Assuming proper normaliza—
tion by variance, 62 : 1 seems to produce the best result. The num—
ber of inferred states depended on all the three parameters but most
significantly by 6%. We see that 6% should be large enough to com—
pactly capture the varying signals from enriched marks as the prior
mean for the emission matrix is zero. For large 6% (>2), the number
of inferred states becomes less affected by other parameters. The de—
viation from the initial number of states to the inferred number is
also mostly determined by 6% but not significantly by others. It ap—
pears to be a good practice to set 6% to be around the mean signal
strength of the enriched marks. The initial number of states should
be selected close to the true number of states. Automatic estimation
of these hyper—parameters would need further investigation in our
future work.

Another important issue is to get a reasonably good initial state
assignment, which encourages consistent state—definition across
species. This issue is especially critical with hiHMM1 in which the
species—specific models are loosely connected. Our current joint ini—
tialization scheme of concatenating different genomes as one and
applying k—means clustering works reasonably well, but this would
be investigated further in our future study.

In this article, we demonstrated a variety of features of hiHMM
that makes it useful for cross—sample joint chromatin state
inference. We have devised two models of hiHMM, each having ad—
vantages and limitations of interpretation and inference. The ﬂexi—
bility of using both learning models allows for a more
comprehensive analysis during different applications and experi—
mental designs.

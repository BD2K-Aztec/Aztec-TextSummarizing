ABSTRACT

Summary: Genevar (GENe Expression VARiation) is a database
and Java tool designed to integrate multiple datasets, and provides
analysis and visualization of associations between sequence
variation and gene expression. Genevar allows researchers to
investigate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associations
within a gene locus of interest in real time. The database and
application can be installed on a standard computer in database
mode and, in addition, on a server to share discoveries among
affiliations or the broader community over the Internet via web
services protocols.

1 INTRODUCTION

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, where gene
expression proﬁling is treated as a phenotypic trait in genome-wide
association studies (GWAS), has successfully been employed to
uncover genetic variants that inﬂuence expression variation in recent
studies (Dixon et (11., 2007; Stranger et (11., 2007a). Single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP)—gene associations from eQTL analysis can
be investigated in populations (Stranger et (11., 2007b) or among
tissue types (Dimas et (11., 2009; Heinzen et (11., 2008). In addition
to genome-wide eQTL identiﬁcation, combinations of eQTLs and
lead SNPs identiﬁed by GWAS have been provided to interrogate
the mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility at speciﬁc loci
(Grundberg et (11., 2009; Nica et (11., 2010; Zeller et (11., 2010).
However, an analytical and visualization tool, together with a
structured repository for multiple datasets, is still needed to facilitate
the investigation of loci of interest and to share data publicly and
among collaborators.

Here, we present Genevar, a database and Java tool designed
to provide: (i) data warehousing; (ii) real-time computation of
correlation signiﬁcance; (iii) visualization of mapping results in a
user-friendly interface; and (iv) an added web services platform

that is implemented as a bridge between the server and multiple
users. Genevar allows published data to be visually accessible in
a secure fashion, without the need for users to download raw
data. Through interactive analysis pipelines, researchers are able
to rapidly investigate, for instance, cis-acting eQTLs at the locus of
interest.

Complementing already available standalone tools (Chen et (11.,
2009; Ge et (11., 2008), a database-centric architecture enables
Genevar to perform complex queries on-the-ﬂy and does not have a
high memory requirement for prior reading in large-scale datasets.
Furthermore, exploiting the convenience of web-based (Wang et (11.,
2003; Zou et (11., 2007) and web-launch (Mueller et (11., 2005) tools,
a Java interface was developed that connects to both database and
web services. The main advantage of this system design is that
users can switch between public services and local data on the same
interface. Default services at the Sanger Institute currently contain
gene expression proﬁling and genotypic data from the following two
datasets: lymphoblastoid cell lines from eight HapMap3 populations
(824 individuals, unpublished data); and three cell types derived
from umbilical cords of 75 Geneva GenCord individuals (Dimas
et (11., 2009).

2 FEATURES

Genevar has two main ﬁinctionalities in cis-eQTL analysis:
(i) identifying eQTLs in genes of interest, and (ii) observing
SNP—gene associations surrounding SNPs of interest (Fig. 1).
Additional features include SNP—probe association plots and
external links to three major genome browsers. Either cis- or trans-
eQTLs can be plotted in the SNP—probe association plot module.
Mapping results are listed in tree nodes in a structural manner,
and information can be saved as PNG diagrams or exported as
tab-delimited lists for further use in presentations or publications.
Genevar is compatible with PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007) genotype
data formats and any tab-delimited expression/genotyping ﬁle in our
format. After uploading datasets onto the database, Genevar presents
expression proﬁling data and individual genotypes in two cataloged
management panels. Once a group of datasets is selected in the
follow-up analysis pipelines, the software automatically prompts
available expression—genotype pairs for the user to Choose from.

Fig. 1. Results of Genevar: a scatter plot represents observed eQTLs in a 2 Mb window centering the GBP3 locus in HapMap3 CHB (A), and a line chart
illustrates observed SNPigene associations in a 2 Mb region surrounding rsl3277ll3 SNP in eight HapMap3 populations (B).

Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient is performed to estimate
the strength of relationship between alleles and gene expression
intensities, linear regression is also used to model the relationship
between the two variables. To test the signiﬁcance of the
relationship, a t-statistic is employed with 11—2 degrees of freedom
for both correlation and regression analysis (Stranger et (11.,
2007b). The software allows the user to adjust the window size
centering on the gene/SNP of interest (e.g. 2Mb) and user-
deﬁned P-value threshold (e.g. P < 0.001) for the featured cis-eQTL
analysis. Alternatively, non-parametric permutation P-values are
also provided in the subsequent association plot module to ﬁlrther
evaluate the signiﬁcance of nominal P-values. In order to construct
a distribution of the test statistic, under the null hypothesis of
no SNP—probe associations, expression intensities are randomly
re-assigned to individuals’ genotypes, then correlation coefﬁcient
and statistical signiﬁcance are re-computed for the relabeled traits,
and this procedure is repeated 10000 times (Stranger et (11.,
2005).

We recommend users to launch Genevar via Java Web Start from
our homepage for the most up-to-date version. After launching,
Genevar is initially in web services mode connecting to the Sanger
Institute. The user can then make another services connection to
afﬁliated institutes, or switch to database mode connecting directly
to user’s local database. Genevar can be run completely ofﬂine
in database mode as there is no communication between the Java
interface and Sanger server.

Future work will include modiﬁed visualization for displaying
next-generation sequence data, e.g. RNA-Seq (Montgomery et (11.,
2010); and implementation of methylation modules to interrogate
epigenomic data.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

This approach to relational database design is an attempt to
systematically decompose traditional ﬂat ﬁles, which are one record
per line and have no structural relationships between the records,
into grouped dimension tables and to reduce data redundancy.
A normalized and structured repository is suitable to warehouse all

kinds of data format regardless of the ﬁle size and ﬁeld numbers.
Most importantly, the advantage of using database indexing on
expression and genotype fact tables highly stabilize retrieval
performance with the subsequent but reasonable cost of slower
uploads and increased disk space. The only limitation when the
datasets grew would be the storage space as this is a trade-off for
query speed.

To maximize the potential of Genevar as a platform shared among
afﬁliations, Genevar has been extended to interact with web services
protocols to enhance data security; the database schema will be
deployed behind and protected by the ﬁrewall, whereas only a secure
frontend webpage acting as a middle layer will be accessible to the
user over the Internet.

Genevar uses Hibernate library (http://www.hibernate.org) to
map obj eCt-oriented models onto MySQL relational database tables
(http://www.mysql.com) in the back-end, and acquires Apache
CXF framework (http://fo.apache.org) to wrap up database queries
and business logics into middle-layer services. Finally, a Tomcat
server (http://tomcat.apache.org) is used to provide services in
the front-end. For a standalone database-mode Genevar, only a
MySQL database is required to be installed on user’s local machine.
Association results are visualized in genomic views by JFreeChart
library (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/). A gene-centered scatter
plot represents observed SNP—gene associations around genes of
interest, and a SNP-centered line Chart illustrates observed eQTLs
surrounding SNPs of interest (Fig. 1).

Tested on a 1.6 GHz Pentium Centrino laptop with 1 GB of RAM,
Genevar was able to upload a 75 X 23k expression dataset onto the
database and built up indexes in l min; another 23 min were required
for the 75><400k genotype ﬁle. Once it is uploaded, Genevar can
fetch per SNP—probe pairs from these 75 individuals in <0.0257 s
from the database, and calculates Spearman’s rhos and nominal
P-values for 486 SNP—probe pairs in 3 s.

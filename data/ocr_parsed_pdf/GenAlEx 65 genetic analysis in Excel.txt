Shannon indices, including the mutual information index SHUA,
an alternative estimator of population structure. The methods
follow Sherwin et a]. (2006) who assessed the performance of
Shannon indices for estimating genetic diversity. Smouse and
Ward (1978) extend to multiple hierarchical levels, with a
unique three—level partition option and statistical testing by
random permutation offered in GenAlEx 6.5.

2.3 Tools for comparing pairwise population statistics

The Mantel test capability of GenAlEx has been extended to
allow multiple comparison among pairwise population statistics
such as FST, F/ST, G/ST, GHST, Best and SHUA.   allow
informed comparison of the new estimators of population
structure.

2.4 Heterogeneity testing for spatial autocorrelation

GenAlEx 6.5 introduces novel heterogeneity tests (Smouse et al.,
2008), extending application of the multiallelic, multilocus spatial
autocorrelation analysis methods of Smouse and Peakall (1999),
Peakall et a]. (2003) and Double et a]. (2005). These new methods
provide valuable insights into flne—scale genetic processes across
a wide range of animals and plants. Banks and Peakall (2012)
have conﬁrmed the statistical power and performance of this
heterogeneity test by spatially explicit computer simulations.

2.5 Linkage disequilibrium tests (LD) for biallelic data

Despite its importance, there is no universal test for disequilib—
rium (Slatkin, 2008). GenAlEx 6.5 offers pairwise tests for dis—
equilibrium between biallelic markers such as SNPs. When phase
is known, this includes the calculation of D, D/, r and r2, follow—
ing Hedrick (2005). Maximum likelihood estimation is used to
calculate D and r when phase is unknown (Weir, 1990, p. 310).
The results were validated against GDA (Lewis and Zaykin,
2001). Inclusion of LD fills an important technical gap, particu—
larly for teachers. For large SNP sets, or multiallelic data,
GenAlEx users are encouraged to take advantage of the options
to export their data to other packages such as Arlequin 3.5
(Excoff1er and Lischer, 2010).

2.6 New allele frequency format

Retrospective calculation of the new estimators of population
structure such as G/ST, Dest and Shannon indices are now pos—
sible from published allele frequency data. Teachers will also find
this a helpful option for the re—analysis of textbook examples.

2.7 Import and export options

GenAlEx offers data import from several popular formats and
tools for importing and manipulating raw data from DNA se—
quencers. Export to more than 30 other data formats is provided,
enabling access to myriad other software packages. For example,
direct export is offered to programs such as GENEPOP
(Rousset, 2008) and STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., 2000),
and via these same formats to many other programs, including
genetic packages in R such as adegenet (Jombart, 2008) and
pegas (Paradis, 2010). The full list of export options, along
with notes on the export process, can found at the website.

3 SPECIAL FEATURES FOR TEACHING

Offering a user—friendly software package for university stu—
dents and teachers remains an ongoing goal of GenAlEx. We
continue to expand the popular step—by—step output options that
allow students to follow the steps in the analytical pathway.
Teaching—specif1c menu options are also provided. For example,
the Rand menu allows students to permute and bootstrap hypo—
thetical datasets with color tracking, to aid an understanding of
how these statistical tests work. Finally, we have made freely
available a set of tutorial notes and supporting datasets drawn
from the graduate workshops that we have offered (both jointly
and independently) around the world.

4 DOCUMENTATION

More than 150 pages of documentation are provided. This
includes Appendix 1 that outlines the statistical analyses
used and their supporting references. The revised guide to
GenAlEx 6.5 fully cross—links with the GenAlEx tutorials
and Appendix 1.

5 CONCLUSION

GenAlEx 6.5 offers a wide range of population genetic analysis
options for the full spectrum of genetic markers within the
Microsoft Excel environment on both PC and Macintosh com—
puters. When combined with its user—friendly interface, rich
graphical outputs for data exploration and publication, tools
for data manipulation and export options to many other soft—
ware packages, we believe that GenAlEx offers an ideal launch—
ing pad for population genetic analysis by students, teachers and
researchers alike.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We thank the many students, teachers and researchers who have
enthusiastically adopted GenAlEx as one of their tools, especially
those who have offered suggestions for improvement. Michaela
Blyton revised the guide, performed extensive beta—testing and
offered crucial advice on improving the user interface. Sasha
Peakall re—designed the GenAlEx logo.

Conﬂict of Interest: none declared.

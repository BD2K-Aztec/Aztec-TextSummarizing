2.2 Analytic power and sample size calculations

Analytic power analysis can be performed for several basic models and
statistical methods. The fundamental idea behind RV association meth-
ods is to compare the difference in cumulative MAF between cases and
controls, or the difference in mean QT values between wild-type individ-
uals and those with alternative alleles. For the casewontrol design, we
calculate case and control MAF under the Bayes’ law. Given the simu-
lated MAF spectrum and effect size at each variant site i, the casewontrol
status-specific genotype frequency is calculated as p(g,»lstatm)= 
where p(g,») is the population genotype frequency, f,» is penetrance,
p(status) is disease prevalence (K) in cases and I-K in controls. To per-
form analytic power analysis for the Combined Multivariate and
Collapsing (CMC) method (Li and Leal, 2008), for a genetic region
with M variants, cumulative MAF for cases or controls can be calculated
as p: 1 — Hiw(1 — pi) and power for detecting the difference between
pom and pmmrlol can be calculated (Fleiss et al., 1980). To perform analytic
power analysis for the Burden of Rare Variants (BRV) (Auer et al., 2013)
method, a 2 X 2 contingency table of expected counts for minor (N 1) and
major (N2) alleles in cases as well as in controls (N ’1 and N ’2) is con-
structed, and a X2 test is applied. For QTs, the expected mean shift is the
joint effect of variants across the region. Denoting each set of causal
variants as V, and the corresponding V: as the set variant sites that
are homozygous for the wild-type allele, the probability to observe such
set of variants in the samples is Hi“ [kl—IE VC (1 — 171-) with effect size
Zia)” where A,- is the effect size of variant i. Then a linear regression-
based goodness-of-fit test can be constructed to perform power and
sample size estimates. Compared with empirical analysis, the
SEQPower analytic framework provides efficient sample size estimates.
The analytic framework also allows for modeling using simulated data;
however, multiple replicates are necessary to compute the average sample
size or power to adjust for the randomness in generating variant sites and
their effect sizes.

 

2.3 Empirical power comparisons

SEQPower can also perform empirical power analysis, which is more
ﬂexible than analytic power analysis and sample size estimation.
Empirical power analysis is available for a large variety of study designs,
disease models and association tests. Power is estimated by the propor-
tion of successes (e.g. P g 0.05) of the total number of independent rep-
licates. Details of association tests in SEQPower can be found in
Supplementary Table S1, and several power analysis examples are pro-
vided in Supplementary Material. Although for empirical analysis it is not
feasible to directly calculate sample size, it is possible to create a grid
search using a small number of replicates to find the approximate sample
size. Because of computational burden, sample size estimation is best
suited for RV association methods for which asymptotic P-values can
be obtained [CMC, Sequence Kernel Association Test (Wu et al., 2011)].
Methods for which P-values must be obtained empirically through per-
mutation [Kernel-based Adaptive Clustering (Liu and Leal, 2010),
Variable Threshold (Price et al., 2010)], it can be computationally inten-
sive to calculate power and sample sizes for small signiﬁcant levels (e.g.
Oz = 2.5 X 10’6 for exome-wide NGS association studies), despite imple-
mentation of adaptive permutation (which reduces the number of permu-
tations used to estimate non-significant P-values). SEQPower also has a
mechanism to incorporate user-provided R scripts for assessment of type
I error and power of novel association methods.

2.4 Performance

SEQPower is written in C ++ and Python. It compiles and runs on most
Unix/Linux systems and Mac workstations. We recently performed a
power analysis using variant frequencies for EuropeaniAmericans ob-
tained from the NHLBI-ESP exome variant server (Tennessen et al.,
2012). For a sample size of 1000 cases and 1000 controls the power to
detect an association for Oz = 2.5 X 10’6 using the BRV method was eval-
uated for all genes within the exome with at least two variants sites, i.e.
19044 genes. Using logistic regression, it took 6.0 min for analytic and
14.6 h for empirical power analyses on an Intel i7-3770 Quad Processor.

3 DISCUSSION

SEQPower is a practical tool for investigators to design ad—
equately powered RV association studies. Although the true
underlying genetic model is unknown, using a range of models,
gene sizes, allelic architectures, effect sizes, etc., an investigator
can determine whether a study has adequate power to at least
detect associations with some of the genes involved in disease
etiology. It is also an important tool to benchmark and compre—
hensively evaluate RV association tests, and also aid in the de—
velopment of new statistical methodologies.

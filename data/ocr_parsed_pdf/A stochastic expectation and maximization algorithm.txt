ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most biological traits may be correlated with the
underlying gene expression patterns that are partially determined by
DNA sequence variation. The correlations between gene expressions
and quantitative traits are essential for understanding the functions
of genes and dissecting gene regulatory networks.

Results: In the present study, we adopted a novel statistical
method, called the stochastic expectation and maximization (SEM)
algorithm, to analyze the associations between gene expression
levels and quantitative trait values and identify genetic loci controlling
the gene expression variations. In the first step, gene expression
levels measured from microarray experiments were assigned to two
different clusters based on the strengths of their association with the
phenotypes of a quantitative trait under investigation. In the second
step, genes associated with the trait were mapped to genetic loci of
the genome. Because gene expressions are quantitative, the genetic
loci controlling the expression traits are called expression quantitative
trait loci. We applied the same SEM algorithm to a real dataset
collected from a barley genetic experiment with both quantitative
traits and gene expression traits. For the first time, we identified
genes associated with eight agronomy traits of barley. These genes
were then mapped to seven chromosomes of the barley genome. The
SEM algorithm and the result of the barley data analysis are useful
to scientists in the areas of bioinformatics and plant breeding.

1 INTRODUCTION

Differential expression analysis often applies to discrete phenotypes
(primarily dichotomous phenotypes). The phenotype is often deﬁned
as ‘normal’ or ‘affected’. If a phenotype is measured quantitatively,
it is often converted into two or a few discrete ordered phenotype
so that a differential expression analysis or an analysis of variances
(ANOVA) method can be applied (Cui et al., 2005; Kerr et al., 2000;
Wemisch et al., 2003; Wolﬁnger et (11., 2001). It is obvious that such

discretization is subject to information loss. The current microarray
data analysis technique has not been able to efﬁciently analyze
the association of gene expression with a continuous phenotype
(Blalock et al., 2004; Jia and Xu 2005). Pearson correlation between
gene expression and a quantitative trait has been proposed (Blalock
et al., 2004; Kraft et al., 2003; Quackenbush, 2001). Blalock et al.
(2004) ranked genes according to the correlation coefﬁcients of
gene expression with MMSE, a quantitative measurement of the
severity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and detected many genes that
are associated with AD. Kraft et al. (2003) used a within family
correlation analysis to remove the effect of family stratiﬁcation.
Pearson correlation is intuitive and easy to calculate. However,
it may not be optimal because (i) the correlation coefﬁcient may
not be the best indicator of the association; (ii) higher order
association cannot be detected; (iii) data are analyzed individually
with one gene at a time; and (iv) the method cannot be extended to
association of gene expression with multiple continuous phenotypes.
Potokina et al. (2004) investigated the association of gene expression
with six malting quality phenotypes (quantitative traits) of 10
barley cultivars. They compared the distance matrix of each
gene expression among the 10 cultivars with the distance matrix
calculated from the phenotypes of all six traits using the G—test
statistic. The G-test statistic was designed to measure the similarity
between two matrices. For each gene, there is a distance matrix
(based on the expression levels). For the phenotypes of six traits,
there is another distance matrix. The two matrices are compared for
the similarity. If the similarity is high, the gene is associated with all
the six phenotypes. Eventually, the associations of the phenotypes
with all the genes are evaluated. The distance matrix comparison
approach may have the same ﬂaws as the correlation analysis.
Recently, we proposed to use the regression coefﬁcient of the
expression on a continuous phenotype as the indicator of the strength
of association (Jia and Xu, 2005). Instead of analyzing one gene at
a time, we took a model-based clustering approach to studying all
genes simultaneously. Qu and Xu (2006) extended the model-based
clustering algorithm to capture genes having higher order association
with the phenotype. The model-based clustering analysis (Jia and
Xu, 2005; Qu and Xu, 2006) classiﬁes genes into several clusters
and all clusters share the same variance—covariance structure. The
analysis is implemented via the expectation—maximization (EM)
algorithm (Dempster et (11., 1977). Several problems have been
encountered for this method. One is the identiﬁability problem where
the cluster labels can be exchanged among different clusters. The
other problem occurs when two or more clusters often have the same
cluster mean. These two problems can be avoided by introducing

a small noise to the cluster means in every iterative step of the
EM algorithm (Qu and Xu, 2006). This ad hoc modiﬁcation of
the EM algorithm lacks strong theoretical foundation and cannot
guarantee to produce the optimal result. In this study, we proposed
an alternative method with a rigorous theoretical basis to solve the
problem. We used this new method to detect expressed genes that
are associated with multiple quantitative traits of barley.

The gene expression levels are quantitative traits (Morley et (11.,
2004). Finding the genetic loci controlling the expressions can help
identify gene regulation networks (Cookson et (11., 2009). Trait-
speciﬁc gene networks can be inferred by studying the genetic loci
controlling the expressed genes only associated with the trait under
investigation. In this study, we focus on a new method called the
stochastic expectation and maximization (SEM) algorithm (Celeux
and Diebolt, 1986) and its application to both expression quantitative
trait locus mapping (eQTL) mapping and phenotype-associated
microarray data analysis. This new method is then compared with
the existing EM algorithm (Jia and Xu, 2005) to demonstrate its
superiority. A real dataset collected in the North American Barley
Genome Project (NABGP) is used for the demonstration.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Experimental data

The gene expression data were published by Luo et a1. (2007) and
downloadable from the ArrayExpress: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/
aer/entry with accession number: E-TABM-112. The phenotypic values of
eight quantitative traits of barley were published by Hayes et a1. (1993)
and downloadable from the following website: http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/
ggpages/SxM/phenotypeshtml. Detailed description of the experiment can
be found from the original study (Hayes et (11.. 1993). The experiment
involved 150 double haploid (DH) lines derived from the cross of two spring
barley varieties. Morex and Steptoe. All the 150 DH lines were microarrayed
for 22 840 transcripts. The eight traits are oz-amylase. diastatic power. grain
protein. grain yield. heading date. plant height. lodging and malt extract. The
phenotypes of the traits were measured in different environments (locations
and years). The number of replicated measurements ranged from 6 to 16
depending on different traits. Both the single trait association and multiple
trait joint association analyses were conducted for all the eight traits using
the average trait values across all environments.

The original (raw) microarray data were normalized using the
RMA algorithm (Irizarry at (11.. 2003) implemented in the GeneSpring
GX 11 software package (Agilent Technologies. Santa Clara. CA.
USA). ArrayExpress also provides the preprocessed dataset without log
transformation. The phenotypic values of each trait were rescaled so that
the range of each trait is between -1 and +1. The formula for the rescaling is

Xk —Xmin
Zk—ZXm-ax —Xmin 1 (1)
where Xk is the original phenotypic value for the k—th line. Xmin and Xmax
are the minimum and maximum values of the phenotypic value. respectively.
and Zk is the rescaled phenotypic value for k = 1, . . . , n. where n is the sample
size (number of DH lines).

2.2 Linear model

Denote the microarray data by a data matrix Y with n rows and m columns.
where n is the number of individuals subject to the microarray analysis and
m is the number of microarrayed genes. Let yj be the jth column of matrix
Y. i.e. an n X 1 vector for the expression levels of gene j for all the n subjects
U:1,...,m). Let Z be an n ><q matrix for the rescaled phenotypic values
of q quantitative traits measured from all n individuals. Let X be a n>< [7

matrix for some factors not directly relevant to the quantitative traits. for
example. gender effect. age effect and so on. We now have three sources
of data (i) Y the microarray data. (ii) Z the phenotypic data and (iii) X the
cofactors not directly relevant to the association study. The cofactors are
not something of interest themselves. but may affect the gene expressions.
They are included in the model to reduce or eliminate the interference on the
association between Y and Z. The expressed levels of gene j can be expressed
using the following linear model.

ijXﬁj-l-ZJ/j-l-Ej (2)

where 13]- is a p X 1 vector for the effects of cofactors. y]- is a (1 X 1 vector for
the regression coefﬁcients of gene j on all the q traits. The residual error 8]-
is an n X 1 vector with an assumed N (0,1 (72) distribution. This assumption
is very common in the linear model analysis. The DH plants are indeed
independent samples from the line cross of the barley experiment. In the
special case of one phenotype with no cofactors. p: q = 1 and X is a vector
of unity with a dimensionality of n X 1.

We now assign prior distributions to the parameters included in the linear
model. The prior distribution for 13]- is

,BjNN(M/3vE/3) (3)

where 115 is a p X 1 vector of mean and 2,3 is an unknown [7 ><p positive
deﬁnite variance matrix. The prior distribution of y]- is a Gaussian mixture
with two components.

yj~JIN(O,21)+(1—JI)N(O,20) (4)

In the above Gaussian mixture. 20 = (01,, is a known diagonal matrix with a
common a):10‘8 across all the diagonal elements. In other words. 20 is a
known positive deﬁnite matrix with values close to zero and the value can be
changed according to the investigator’s preference. For the other cluster. 21
is an unknown positive deﬁnite variance matrix. This Gaussian mixture prior
divides all the genes into two clusters. one (cluster 1) being associated with
the phenotypes and the other (cluster 0) not associated with the phenotype.
Variable JT (0 <7! <1) is a prior probability that a gene randomly selected
from the pool belongs to cluster 1. A gene classiﬁed into cluster one is claimed
to be associated with the traits while genes classiﬁed into cluster zero are
not associated with the traits. The actual parameters involved in the problem
are denoted by

6={u5,25,21,02,n} (5)

We are also interested in pj. the posterior probability of gene j being
associated with the traits. The relationship between the posterior p]- and the
prior 7'! will be presented later.

Let 8j~Burnoulli(pJ-). for O<pj <1. be an indicator variable for the
cluster membership of gene j. It is deﬁned as

_ 1 if j belongs to cluster 1 (6)
J _ O ifj belongs to cluster 0
Given (31-. the genetic effect y]- has the following distribution.
VjNSjN(Ov21)+(1_8j)N(Ov20) (7)

Note that this conditional distribution is not a Gaussian mixture because the
membership is already known. The indicator variable (3]- tells which Gaussian
component y]- belongs to. Also note that the parameter vector does not include
13]- and yj. Under the random model framework. 13]— and y]- are treated as
missing values. If they are integrated out. the density of yj given the cluster
membership is normal with mean and variance shown in the following normal
density

pgj|e,5j)=1v{yj|X;1,g,X>:,3XT+zejo +102} (8)

where
®j=8j21+(1—6j)20 (9)
and the notation N {y|a,b} stands for the normal density of variable y with
mean a and variance 1). Given the cluster membership.8={8j}. the log

likelihood function for the entire dataset is

The MLE of parameters are obtained through a two-step approach. The ﬁrst
step is to estimate the parameters by maximizing the above log likelihood
function given 8 = {6,} through the regular expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm (Dempster at (11.. 1977). This step is called the EM step. The
second step is to stochastically simulate 8 = { 13,-} from its conditional posterior
distribution. This step is called the stochastic step. The two steps are repeated
iteratively until a stationary distribution is reached for each parameter.
an algorithm called the stochastic expectation and maximization (SEM)
algorithm (Celeux and Diebolt, 1986). The stochastic step and the EM step
are performed sequentially. not in parallel.

2.3 Stochastic sampling

The density of y,- deﬁned in Equation (8) can be split into the following two
densities.

p1(y1|6>=p(y,-Ie.6,-=1>=Noj1X31.X2,3XT+2212T+1112) (11)
and
170(yj|9)=l7(yj|91 51' =0)=N(leXM/31XEﬁXT +Z202T +102) (12)

Because (3,- is a Bernoulli variable. it is sampled from

distribution. Once 8 = {13,-} are sampled for all genes in the stochastic process.
we can proceed with the EM algorithm described below.

2.4 EM algorithm

The EM algorithm for the Gaussian mixture model is standard (Dempster
at (11.. 1977) and thus we only provide the EM steps without proof. Denote
the variance covariance matrix of y,- conditional on (3,- by

O,=var(y,—|8,—)=8,—21+(1—8j)20 (15)

Let us deﬁne
V,=X2,3XT+Z®,-ZT+I:72 (16)
We now provide the formulas for updating each parameter using the EM

Given 13,-. the unknown varianceicovariance matrix of y,- is 8,26,21+

we only need to update 21 using all y,- that come from cluster one. The

The E-step of the EM algorithm consists of calculatingE(ﬁ,-),E(y,-),var(ﬁ,)
and var(y,-).The M-step consists of calculating 9: {11,3, 2,3, 21,02,71}. So
far all parameter have been updated. We can now combine the stochastic steps
with the EM steps to compete the analysis. Note again that the stochastic
and EM steps are performed sequentially and repeated many times until a
stationary distribution for each parameter is reached.

2.5 SEM estimate

The SEM algorithm differs from the classical EM algorithm in that the
parameters do not converge to some ﬁxed values; rather. they converge to
a stationary distribution due to the stochastic process of (3: {13,-}. We can
monitor the converging process for each parameter. Once all parameters
have converged. we start to collect the posterior sample for 9. Unlike the
posterior sample for the fully Bayesian analysis. the observations with the
posterior sample for the SEM algorithm are not correlated. The posterior
sample size. denoted by T. does not have to be large; T: 100 seems to be

sufﬁcient. Let 6“) = {11530, 2%), 2i!) , (72“) , 71”} be the t-th observation in the

posterior sample (after convergence). the estimate parameter vector of the
SEM algorithm is

9; rather. it is

11:;ij “$251 (27)

1:1 1:1

that is most important because it represents the posterior probability that gene
j belongs to cluster 1. i.e. gene j is associated with the quantitative traits.
These 13,95 are ranked in a descending order. The top proportion of genes is
selected as candidate genes associated with the phenotypes. The proportion
is deﬁned by the investigator in an arbitrary manner. Some objective criteria.
e.g. false discovery rate (FDR). may be used. but it is not the focus of this
study. Here. we simply chose an arbitrary cut-off value of p,- 3 0.9 to declare
signiﬁcant association.

2.6 Expression quantitative trait locus mapping

The gene expression levels can be treated as quantitative traits and QTL
mapping can be performed on each transcript. so-called eQTL mapping
(Kendziorski at (11.. 2006). The problem with the eQTL analysis is that the
large number of expression traits make eQTL mapping very difﬁcult. The
SEM algorithm developed for the quantitative trait-associated microarray
data analysis can be extended to eQTL mapping with limited modiﬁcation.
This section describes the application of the SEM algorithm to eQTL
mapping.

Consider Q markers with known map positions and the genotypes for
all the n individuals. We will study the association of all the m transcripts
simultaneously with the k-th marker for k = 1, . . . , Q. The approach is similar
to the interval mapping in which one marker is studied at a time (Lander and

 

65

H.Zhan et al.

 

Botstein, 1989). The entire eQTL mapping will take Q separate analyses.
Using the same model as given in Equation (2), we now replace the phenotype
Z by the numerically coded genotype of marker k denoted by Zk so that

yj =X,3j+Zk]/jk+8j (28)

where yjk is the QTL effect for transcript j at marker k. The Zk variable is
deﬁned as
_ +1 for A 1A 1

29
—1 forA2A2 ( )

where A [A] is ﬁrst genotype and A [A] is the second genotype of marker k.
The barley population under study is a doubled haploid population and thus
only two genotypes exist for each locus.

We now have to analyze the data Q times, one for each marker. Previously,
we have a single 7'! for the proportion of genes associated with the phenotype.
We now have Q suchrr’s to indicate the proportions of transcripts associated
with all markers, denoted by a vector

n=[7n  HQ] (30)

In addition, the posterior probability of gene j associated with marker k
is denoted by pjk. These parameters { 71k, pjk} are important to the eQTL
mapping. The SEM algorithm remains the same as before except that we
must analyze the data Q times (one for each marker).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Single trait association

Since each trait was measured from multiple environments, we took
the average of the phenotypic values across the environments as
the phenotypic values that entered the linear model for analysis.
Therefore, the Z matrix for each trait analysis was an n X 1 =
150 X 1 vector for the average phenotypic values (rescaled between
—1 and +1). The number of transcripts (genes) measured in the
experiment was m = 22 840. Since no other cofactor existed except
the intercept, (3, is a scalar with dimension 1): 1. For the single trait
analysis, (1:1 for each trait analysis. Each of the ﬁve parameters
6: { [1,3, 2,3, 21, (72, IT} is of single dimension.

Both the (two-cluster) SEM algorithm developed here and the
three-cluster EM algorithm of Jia and Xu (2005) were used for
the single trait association study. The EM algorithm of Jia and Xu
(2005) classiﬁed each gene into one of three clusters. The three
clusters shared a common variance of the regression coefﬁcient but
with three different means. The three cluster means were restricted
with negative value for the ﬁrst cluster, zero for the second cluster
and positive value for the third cluster. Genes classiﬁed into either
the ﬁrst or the third cluster are differentially expressed genes. The
criterion of detection for each gene was that the posterior probability
of being in cluster 2 (the neutral cluster) was less than 0.1. This is
equivalent to the criterion of ,0, 3 0.9 in the SEM analysis.

The numbers of genes associated with each of the eight traits are
listed in Table 1 for the SEM and the EM algorithms. We can see that
the SEM algorithm consistently detected more genes than the EM
algorithm. The result of the SEM algorithm shows that more genes
are associated with the height and grain protein than other traits.
The heading date trait has the least number of associated genes.
The estimated parameters for all the eight traits obtained from the
separate SEM analyses are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Lists of
all the detected genes associated with the traits and gene annotations
are given in Supplementary Table S2 (Sheetl—Sheet8) for interested
readers.

Fig. 1. ROC curve comparing the SEM and EM algorithms in the simulation
study.

In order to compare the performance of the SEM model
and the EM model, we carried out a simulation experiment based
on the SEM model by using the estimated parameters obtained
from the barley data (grain yield) analysis. The ROC curve (Fig. 1)
shows that both the SEM and the EM models have high sensitivity
and speciﬁcity, but the SEM model performs better and has higher
sensitivity. It is well known that the EM algorithm tends to converge
to some sub-optimal values which are close to the initial values. We
set different parameters and simulated several datasets based on the
EM model to test the convergence of parameters. When parameters
are precisely estimated, the EM model is able to identify most of
the associated genes. If parameters converge to some local optimal
values that are different from the true values, the sensitivity is quite
low. However, the SEM model can identify most associated genes in
both cases and has high sensitivity and speciﬁcity, which are similar
to the EM results when parameters were estimated well. We also
performed permutation for the real data analysis by permuting the
phenotypes (grain yield) to test the speciﬁcity of the two methods.
After 100 permutations by the grain yield, we took average of the
posterior probabilities generated from the 100 permutations for each
gene and we found that no gene had probabilities exceeding the cut-
off point (0.9), which indicates that the SEM method also has good
speciﬁcity in real data analysis.

We choose the grain yield as an example to demonstrate the
converging process of the estimated parameters. The trace plots
(parameters against the iteration) are depicted in Figure 2 for

all the ﬁve parameters and the regression coefﬁcient of gene
AF250937_s_at. From the trace plots, we can see that all parameters
have converged in about 10 iterations. After the parameters
converged to their stationary distributions, the parameters ﬂuctuated
around the mean values and the means are the SEM estimates of the
parameters.

We also presented the predicted regression coefﬁcients obtained
with the SEM analysis and the scatter plots of the observed genes
expressions for the genes associated with each trait (Supplementary
Figure S1). Some genes have positive associations with the traits,
e.g. AF250937_s_at and Contig6445_at, and some have negative
associations with the traits, e.g. Contig23592_at and Contig3295_at.

3.2 Multiple traits association study

For the joint association study of eight traits, the dimensionality of
the parameters increased top = 8 and q = 8. Therefore, [1,3 is an 8 X 1
vector, 2,3 is a 8 X 8 matrix and 21 is an 8 X 8 matrix. The rest of

the parameters, 71' and (72, remain scalars. The Z matrix is an 150 X 8
matrix for all the eight traits measured from all the 150 DH lines.
Only the SEM algorithm was used in this analysis because the EM
algorithm of Jia and Xu (2005) cannot be applied to multiple trait
association study.

Using the same criterion of ,0, 3 0.9 to declare signiﬁcance
association, we detected a total of 1646 genes that are jointly
associated with the eight traits, accounting for 7.2% of all the 22 840
genes included in the analysis. The list of associated genes is given
in the supplemental data (Supplementary Table S3) for interested
readers. The estimated parameters are ﬁ=0.089 and 82:0.067
for the proportion and residual error variance, respectively. The
estimated [1,3 and 2,3 are [1,3 =7.978 and 2,3 =4.652, respectively.

cluster is

Note that the proportion of genes detected (7.2%) in the experiment
is not the same as fr:8.9% because the former depends on the
cut-off point (,0,. 3 0.9) used for gene declaration, whereas the latter
represents the probability that a randomly selected gene belongs to
the associated cluster and it does not depend on the cut-off point. In
the simulation study, we used parameters estimated from the barley
data to simulate 5000 genes (100 individuals) based on the SEM
model. The SEM algorithm identiﬁed all associated genes, which
indicated that SEM does have high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. By
randomly permuting the eight traits, we tested the speciﬁcity of SEM
in real data analysis. Among the total of 22 840 genes, 521 genes
still had signiﬁcant effects in the permuted data. The false positive
is 521/22 840 = 0.022 811, reasonably low.

Interestingly, all genes associated with the 8 traits in the single
trait analysis were also detected in the joint analysis, demonstrating
the high efﬁciency of the joint analysis. The estimated regression
coefﬁcients for the top ten genes jointly associated with all traits are
listed in Table 2 along with the F -test statistics and the P-values.

3.3 eQTL mapping

The purpose of the eQTL mapping is to identify the locations of the
genome that control the expressions of the transcripts. We used the
results of the previous analysis to reduce the number of transcripts
for the eQTL analysis. For example, out of the 22 840 transcripts,
we identiﬁed 888 genes that are associated with the grain protein
trait. The eQTL mapping was then targeted to these 888 transcripts.
This has dramatically reduced the number of transcripts for eQTL
mapping related to the grain protein trait. Recall that Table 1 gives
the number of transcripts associated with each of the eight traits. The
eQTL mapping for each trait was only conducted on the identiﬁed
transcripts. The barley genome contains seven chromosomes. The
total number of SNP markers investigated was Q=495 with an

The entire eQTL analysis took about nine hours of Intel Core Duo
CPU P8400, 2.27 GHz in an Hp Pavilion dv4 computer. Figure 3a—d
shows the plots of the proportions of transcripts associated with
markers for four of the eight traits. There is too much information
obtained from the eQTL analysis. Supplementary Figure S2e—h
shows the plots of the remaining four traits. Here, we used grain
protein and yield traits as examples to describe the plots. For the

grain protein trait, three chromosomes (2, 3, 5) seem to control more
genes than other chromosomes. For example, the central region of
chromosome 2 contains almost 50% of the 888 transcripts. This
region is considered as a hot spot. For the yield trait, chromosome 3
is the only one containing more transcripts. The hot spot is located
in the middle of the chromosome and it controls the expression of
about 80% of the 457 transcripts.

Other information about this eQTL analysis is provided in

4 DSCUSSON

We adopted a new statistical method (SEM) for quantitative trait
associated microarray data analysis. We used the method to analyze
22 840 microarrayed genes associated with eight quantitative traits
in barley. Many genes have been identiﬁed to be associated
with these traits. The actual functions of these genes in barley
are not known prior to this study. These genes are provided
in Supplementary Table S2 (Sheetl—Sheet8) and Supplementary
Table S3. For example, among the 22840 genes, 888 are related
to grain protein content. This dataset provides much information
for barley biologists to further study these genes. The functions
of some genes are known in rice. For example, according to
BLASTX results, transcript 22 767 (rbah35f01_s_at) is the code
for the Cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase in rice. This
gene is strongly associated to the grain protein in barley, with an
F -test statistic of 1436.718 and a P-value of zero.

The same SEM algorithm for phenotype associated microarray
data analysis has been applied to eQTL mapping with virtually no
modiﬁcation. The eQTL mapping conducted was still an interval
mapping approach where one marker is analyzed at a time.
However, all the transcripts were analyzed simultaneously. This
is already a signiﬁcant improvement over the traditional interval
mapping for QTL where one transcript was analyzed at a time
(Kendziorski et (11 ., 2006). Results of the eQTL analysis are provided
in Supplementary Table S4 (Sheetl—Sheet8) and Supplementary
Table S5 (Sheetl—Sheet8). This dataset will help barley biologists
to infer gene networks for these quantitative traits. Transcripts
simultaneously associated with one marker belong to the same
network (or pathway) because they are all controlled by the
segregation of the same locus. For example, marker ABC152D (83.1
cM) on chromosome 2 controls the expression of about 50% of the
transcripts associated with the grain protein. These transcripts are
allegedly to be in the same pathway for the development of grain
protein.

Theoretically, the method can analyze all markers simultaneously
using a single model. This is the all-transcript-and-all-marker model.
Practically, however, it is difﬁcult to handle the large matrix with
a dimensionality repeatedly in the SEM algorithm. The theory is
identical to the joint analysis of all the eight traits (a matrix). Further
study on this simultaneous analysis is needed for the SEM algorithm.
The MCMC implemented Bayesian eQTL mapping (Jia and Xu,
2007) can be adopted here, but it is a sampling based method
and is time consuming in terms of computing time. This study
focused on the SEM algorithm for phenotype associated microarray
analysis with the eQTL mapping as an example of extension to other
problems.

Finally, the data were analyzed using an R program, which can
be downloaded from our laboratory website (www.statgen.ucr.edu)
under the ‘Phenotype Associated Microarray’ section. A sample
dataset (subset of the barley data) is also provided in the website
for interested users to test the method. Users may customize the
code to analyze their own data using the SEM algorithm.

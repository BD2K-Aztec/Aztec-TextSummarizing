Abstract

Motivation: A major goal of biomedical research is to identify molecular features associated with a
biological or clinical class of interest. Differential expression analysis has long been used for this
purpose; however, conventional methods perform poorly when applied to data with high within
class heterogeneity.

Results: To address this challenge, we developed EMDomics, a new method that uses the Earth
mover’s distance to measure the overall difference between the distributions of a gene’s expres—
sion in two classes of samples and uses permutations to obtain q—values for each gene. We applied
EMDomics to the challenging problem of identifying genes associated with drug resistance in ovar—
ian cancer. We also used simulated data to evaluate the performance of EMDomics, in terms of
sensitivity and specificity for identifying differentially expressed gene in classes with high within
class heterogeneity. In both the simulated and real biological data, EMDomics outperformed
competing approaches for the identification of differentially expressed genes, and EMDomics was
significantly more powerful than conventional methods for the identification of drug resistance—
associated gene sets. EMDomics represents a new approach for the identification of genes
differentially expressed between heterogeneous classes and has utility in a wide range of complex
biomedical conditions in which sample classes show within class heterogeneity.

developed for supervised analyses of gene expression profiling data
[e.g. significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) (Tusher et (11.,
2001), Limma (Smyth, 2004), cuffdiff (Trapnell et (11., 2012), DESeq
(Anders and Huber, 2010) and edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010)], and
these methods (and variants of them) are widely used in the gen—
omics community for the identification of genes differentially ex—
pressed betvveen classes.

In general, these methods use a variant of the t—statistic (e.g.
SAM, Limma, cuffdiff) or approaches designed specifically for se—
quence read count data (such as that obtained by RNA—Seq) based
on an assumption of distribution of aligned short reads (such as
negative binomial distribution) to generate a test statistic to sum—
marize the gene’s differential expression. These approaches then use
a statistical test (e.g. Fisher exact test for edgeR and DESeq) or per—
mutation tests (e.g. SAM) to determine statistical significance of the
differential expression. For t—test—based methods, a gene’s test score
and significance will tend to be high when the difference in the mean
of the gene’s expression levels between the classes is large and the
gene’s variance is low. Thus, these methods perform well for the
identification of genes that show a high degree of between classes
(inter—class) heterogeneity in expression and a low degree of within
class (intra—class) heterogeneity. For the Fisher exact test based
methods, the null hypothesis is that there is no association between
a gene’s read counts and sample class labels. Similar to the t—test—
based methods, these methods do not effectively capture intra—class
heterogeneity since all expression values are summed within a group
to calculate the test statistic. In addition, because these methods are
based on parametric models, they do not perform well when the
data do not fit the method’s model, limiting their generalizability.

Although the term differentially expressed is now widely used in
the genomics community to refer to a gene that shows a significant
difference in mean expression between two classes, difference in
mean expression is not the only way a gene may be expressed differ—
entially between two classes, and conventional approaches fail to
capture alternative types of differential expression (e.g. two classes
with identical means and variances, but samples in one class show a
bimodal pattern of expression versus the other class which shows a
unimodal pattern of expression across samples). We expect this limi—
tation of conventional approaches to be especially important for the
identification of genes associated with phenotypic classes showing
significant intraclass heterogeneity. For example, a major goal of
genomics research in cancer is to identify genes associated with drug
resistance. Given the significant inter—patient molecular heterogen—
eity in cancer (Burrell et (11., 2013) (in which subtypes of tumors are
driven by distinct sets of molecular alterations), it is likely that
among both sensitive and resistant tumors, there is heterogeneity in
the molecular factors driving the sensitive or resistant phenotype in
each class. In most cases, the structure of this intraclass heterogen—
eity will not be known ahead of time; thus, this unknown subtype
structure cannot be incorporated into standard supervised statistical
methods, which will limit the power of conventional methods for
identification of the relevant genes.

In a broader sense, the problems that sample heterogeneity im—
pose on analyzing gene expression data have been previously recog—
nized and several methods to address these problems have been
proposed. For example, the cMonkey algorithm (Reiss et (11., 2006)
has been proposed to detect putative coregulated gene groupings by
clustering on both genes and conditions and integrating functional
associations and detection of sequence motifs to overcome hetero—
geneity across samples and conditions.

In particular, several prior methods have been proposed as alter—
natives to conventional differential expression analysis for

prioritizing genes, which may show heterogeneity both within and
across groups of samples. Lyons—Weiler et al. proposed a heuristic
method based on counting the number of samples in both groups
that are found beyond the nth percentile of the samples in the oppos—
ite group to identify genes that have different pattern of expression
in the two groups, beside difference in means. This method is called
permutation percentile separability test (PPST) (Lyons—Weiler et (11.,
2004). MacDonald and Ghosh proposed a method, Cancer Outlier
Profile Analysis (COPA), based on robust centering and scaling of
the data to identify pairs of samples with mutually exclusive out—
liers, and they used this approach to identify genes involved in recur—
rent translocations (MacDonald and Ghosh, 2006). Both of these
methods may improve on conventional differential expression
analyses for special cases of intra—group heterogeneity [e.g. identifi—
cation of genes that show differential patterns of high— and low—
expression across groups according to a pre—specified percentile
threshold (Lyons—Weiler et (11., 2004) and prioritization of pairs of
outlier genes (MacDonald and Ghosh, 2006)].

The primary goal of our study is to develop a powerful, robust,
and general approach for the identification of genes differentially ex—
pressed between classes that have significant intraclass heterogen—
eity. To achieve this goal, we compare distribution functions of
expression values between classes instead of considering just the first
few moments of the distributions (such as mean and variance) or
using parametric models. To do this, we use the Earth mover’s dis—
tance (EMD) (Rubner et (11., 1998, 2000), which is an approach
commonly used in image processing to compute distances between
color histograms of two digital images. There are several other
methods for distribution comparisons. In this work, we chose EMD
because it is a nonparametric method, is not sensitive to histogram
binning, gives a measure of ground distance, allows for partial
matches, and can be computed efficiently (Rubner et (11., 2000). To
our knowledge, EMD has not previously been developed or tested
for differential gene expression analysis. In the setting of two—class
problems, we use EMD to measure the overall difference between
the distributions of a gene’s expression in two classes of samples.
After computing EMD scores for each gene, we use permutations to
estimate false discovery rates and obtain q-values for each gene.
EMD can also be applied to other genomics data, such as copy num—
ber values or single cell RNA—Seq data, to identify genes with alter—
ation profiles that are different between two heterogeneous groups.
We refer to our method, which is an adaptation of the EMD method
to the analysis of Omics data, as EMDomics.

We use simulated data as well as real biological data to show the
power of EMDomics to identify differentially expressed genes com—
pared to alternative methods when there is both intra— and inter—
class heterogeneity. To evaluate the theoretical basis for EMDomics,
we used simulated data and compare the performance of
EMDomics to SAM and Limma (two of the most commonly used
differential expression analysis methods), as well as to Kolmogorov—
Smirnov (KS) and Cramer Von Mises (CVM) (two of the most com—
monly used distribution comparison methods), in terms of sensitivity
and specificity for identifying genes truly expressed differentially in
the simulation. To evaluate the performance of EMDomics on real
biological data, we apply it to the challenging problem of identifying
genes associated with drug response in ovarian cancer. Ovarian can—
cer is the deadliest and the second most common gynecologic cancer
(Siegel et (11., 2013). Almost all women diagnosed with ovarian can—
cer receive a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum—
based chemotherapy (Heintz et (11., 2006). Although a subset of
patients respond to chemotherapy, the majority do not respond and
ultimately succumb to the disease. There have been several

published gene expression profiling studies on drug resistance for
ovarian cancer, but because of data heterogeneity it has been diffi—
cult to identify robust predictors of chemotherapy response using
conventional statistical approaches (Konstantinopoulos et (11.,
2008). We use clinically annotated ovarian cancer gene expression
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We compare
EMDomics performance on these data to Limma, SAM and edgeR,
as well as to KS and CVM, in terms of power to identify differen—
tially expressed genes, pathways and gene sets associated with drug
resistance in ovarian cancer.

2 Methods

EMD is a measure of distance between two distributions that re—
ﬂects the minimum cost of transforming one distribution into the
other. If you imagine two piles of dirt (Pilep and PileQ), the EMDpQ
is the minimum work required to move dirt from Pilep to PileQ to
make the piles even (Fig. 1). EMD can be computed through solving
linear optimization of the classic transportation problem (Dantzig,
1951).

2.1 Differential expression analysis using EMD

We developed a new approach (EMDomics) for differential expres—
sion analysis of genomics data. Whereas test statistics generated by
standard differential expression approaches reﬂect the likelihood
that the difference of mean expression between two groups is non—
zero (e.g. SAM and Limma) or reﬂect the significance of the associ—
ation between abundance of short reads of the two groups (e.g.
edgeR and DEseq), the EMD test statistic reﬂects the overall differ—
ence between two normalized distributions (Fig. 1). The EMDomics
method computes the EMD for each gene in a genomewide analysis
and determines statistical significance through permutation testing
and estimation of false discovery rates (FDRs), indicated by q-values
(Storey, 2002).

2.2 Computing the EMD score

The EMD procedure is more fully described in (Rubner et (11.,
1998). Brieﬂy, the EMD computes the distance between two distri—
butions, which are represented by signatures. The signatures are sets
of weighted features that capture the distributions. For the differen—
tial gene expression analysis application, the signatures are data den—
sities computed from gene expression values’ histograms from each
class of samples. Two signatures P and Q can be represented as:
P : {(171, Law), . .. , (pm, wpm)}, where p, is the center of the ith histo—
gram cell and wp, is the weight of the cell; and
Q : {(q1,wq1), . .. , (qn,qu)}, where q,- is the center of the [Eh histo—
gram cell and WW is the weight of the cell. Given P, Q, and d,,- (the

2.3 Calculating q-values for EMD scores

The q-value is the permutation—based estimate of the FDR when
calling significance at that gene’s test statistic level (Storey, 2002).
The FDR is the expected proportion of rejected null hypotheses that
are rejected incorrectly at a given significance threshold. To calcu—
late the q-value of the EMD test, we follow the approach proposed
in (Storey, 2002). To generate the null distribution, we permute the
sample labels and for each iteration, we compute the EMD between
the permuted classes. In our experiments, we performed 1000 iter—
ations, and we used the median of permuted EMDs for each gene as
a null distribution to compute FDRs and q-values.

To compute the q-value for each gene, we obtain FDRs for a
range of significance thresholds, from a strict threshold to a lenient
one. Given M : [m1, . . . ,mN], a vector of median of permuted
EMDs, and EMD : [emdh . . . ,emdN], a vector of observed EMDs,
the mathematical representation of FDR for gene /' and significance
threshold i, t,, is as follows:

N

N—  emdiZti

Where I is the indicator function, N is the number of genes in the
dataset, and t,’s are in descending order from T to zero with step A:
{T, T— A, T—2A,  ,A,0} . In our experiments, we set A
: 0.001 and T to the rounded maximum EMD minus 1 (T23).
Then, the q-value for gene / is calculated as:

q—valuei : min(FDR,-).

3 Results

3.1 Simulation experiment to evaluate the performance
of EMDomics

We designed and performed simulation experiments to evaluate the
performance of EMDomics across a variety of models of heterogen—
eity in a two class problem, ranging from no true intra—class hetero—
geneity (a single random process within each of the two classes) to
more extensive intraclass heterogeneity (a mixture of random proc—
esses within one class of samples). Using the simulated datasets, we
compared the sensitivity and specificity of EMDomics and SAM for
calling significant genes.

The simulated datasets each contain 16 000 genes measured
across a total of 240 samples. The samples come from two classes:
class 1 contains 90 samples; and class 2 contains 150 samples.
Simulated gene expression values for 15 000 genes were drawn from
the same Gaussian distribution for the two classes, with zero mean

and variance of 1 (N (0,1)), which simulate truly non—differentially
expressed genes. Gene expression values for the remaining 1000
genes are drawn from different distributions for the two classes and
simulate truly differentially expressed genes. For these 1000 truly
differentially expressed genes, we considered five cases for the Class
1, ranging from no intra—group heterogeneity to significant intra—
group heterogeneity as shown in Figure 2. For all five cases, gene ex—
pression values for the Class 1 samples are drawn from Gaussian
distributions with variance of 9, but with different means (m,)
(Classl ~N(m,~, 9)). Gene expression values for Class 2 are drawn
from Gaussian distributions with mean (m) centered on zero,
(m N N(0, 0.04)), and variance of 9 (ClassZ ~ N(m, 9)).

We applied EMDomics and SAM to the five simulated datasets.
We chose SAM, because it calculates q-values in the same manner as
EMDomics calculates q-values, facilitating a fair comparison be—
tween the methods. For each simulated case we evaluated a range of
q-value thresholds for calling significant genes from 0 to 1, and we
computed sensitivities (true positive rate) and precisions (1— false—
positive rate). The ROC curves for EMDomics and SAM are shown
in Figure 2(a). For case one, in which differentially expressed genes
are simulated using a single Gaussian distribution with fold change
of approximately 2 (no intraclass heterogeneity), EMDomics per—
forms similarly to SAM and both have area under curve (AUC) val—
ues close to 1. Adding more heterogeneity to the simulated data

EMDomics (solid lines) and SAM (dashed lines) for five cases with different
level of heterogeneity in Class 1 samples, ranging from no intra-group hetero-
geneity (case 1) to significant intra-group heterogeneity (cases 4 and 5) as
described in the table (cl). True positive rates of EMDomics and SAM for (b)
q—value threshold of 0.05 and (c) q—value threshold of 0.2

resulted in EMDomics outperforming SAM, as indicated by higher
true positive rates and lower false positive rates and significantly
higher AUC for EMDomics (Fig. 2(a); Table 1). For cases 4 and 5,
which represent highly heterogeneous data, EMDomics is still able
to detect most differentially expressed genes with a low false positive
rate, while SAM performs poorly. Table 1 shows the performance of
EMDomics and SAM for a significance threshold of q-value : 0.05.
Figure 2(b) and (c) show true positive rates of EMDomics and SAM
for significance thresholds of q : 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. SAM’s
sensitivity for identifying significantly differentially expressed genes
from highly heterogeneous data (cases 4 and 5) is very low at both
significance thresholds, suggesting that EMDomics will increasingly
outperform SAM for the identification of differentially expressed
genes in the setting of increasing levels of intra—class heterogeneity.

To more fully evaluate this hypothesis, we compare the perform—
ance of EMDomics with SAM, Limma and edgeR on a real biomed—
ical data set in the following section.

Because the EMD method depends on the comparing the nor—
malized histograms of the two groups, it requires moderate to large
sample sizes. We investigated the effects of sample size on specificity
and sensitivity of the results using simulated datasets. We generated
six simulated datasets with different sample sizes, ranging from 300
to 3 (Supplementary Fig. S1). We generated these datasets for case
1, when there is no intra group heterogeneity, and for case 4, where
there is a very high level of intra group heterogeneity. EMDomics re—
sults show that there is a sharp decrease in the true positive rate for
sample size less than 30 samples in the smallest group for both cases
1 and 4, especially for case 1. Although true positive rates decrease
with smaller sample size, false positive rates stay at zero for a wide
range of FDR thresholds (FDR threshold < 0.25). Supplementary
Figure S1 shows true positive rates and false positive rates for FDR
threshold of 0.05 and 0.20.

3.2 EMDomics for the identification of genes associated
with drug resistance in ovarian cancer

To identify genes associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer,
we applied EMDomics to the processed and normalized ovarian
cancer gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). We used gene expression data from the Agilent 244K
Custom Gene Expression platform which includes 17 814 genes
(Supplementary File 1). As of January 2014, Agilent microarray
data of 570 cases with HG—SOC were available in TCGA. Clinical
data from these patients were carefully examined to identify eligible
samples for assessing cis—platinum chemotherapy response. We used
similar definition as used in (Integrated genomic analyses of ovarian
carcinoma, 2011) for resistant and sensitive tumors. Tumors were
defined as sensitive if after the last primary treatment the platinum

free interval was 6 months or greater, there was no evidence of pro—
gression or recurrence, and the follow—up interval was at least 6
months from the date of last primary platinum treatment. Tumors
were defined as resistant if the patient recurred within 6 months
after the last treatment (Integrated genomic analyses of ovarian car—
cinoma, 2011). Among the 570 cases, we identified 331 cases with
explicit cis—platinum status, with 97 platinum resistant and 234 plat—
inum sensitive primary tumors. The clinical information of the re—
sistant and sensitive samples is given in the Supplementary Table S1.

Figure 3(a) shows the scatter plot of observed EMD scores versus
median of permuted EMD scores. Since EMD is a measure of the
distance between two distributions it is a positive number. As ex—
pected, observed EMD scores tend to be larger than the median of
permuted EMD scores. Histograms of the permuted EMD values
and observed EMD values are shown in Supplementary Figure S2.

In differential expression analysis, the fold change (the ratio of
the mean (or median) expression level of a gene between two classes)
is commonly used as a metric to indicate the magnitude of expres—
sion change across two classes and is a natural complement to the t—
test, which is a measure of the statistical significance of differences
in mean expression between two classes. However, in the setting of
significant intraclass heterogeneity, fold change may not be a suit—
able indicator of the magnitude of differential expression between
groups, and EMD may be a more useful metric. Figure 3(b) is a scat—
ter plot of EMD versus fold change for all genes and shows that fold
change and EMD are only moderately correlated, and a significant
proportion of genes have low fold change (close to one) but large
EMD (two and more), which supports the hypothesis that genes can
show significant differences in overall expression distribution be—
tween classes, while at the same time showing little difference in
mean expression between classes.

We also applied EMDomics to the TCGA ovarian cancer RNA—
Seq data, which is available for a subset of ovarian cancer samples
in TCGA. This dataset contains 30 resistant and 67 sensitive sam—
ples. After filtering out genes that in more than 50% of samples had
a normalized read count less than 20, the data set includes 8106
genes. We applied EMDomics to the log 2 normalized read count
data (transcript per million (TPM)) for genes after quantile normal—
ization. We observed similar behavior in the EMDomics results
compared to those obtained when applying EMDomics to array—
based data. The scatter plot of observed EMD scores versus median
of permuted EMD scores and scatter plot of EMD versus fold
change for all genes are shown in Supplementary Figures S3 and S4.

there are differences across microarray and RNAseq, overall, we see
significant correlation of the EMDomics measures across the two
platforms (Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.3 Comparison of EMDomics with conventional
differential expression analysis methods.

We compared the performance of EMDomics with that of SAM,
Limma and edgeR for the identification of genes associated with
drug response in ovarian cancer. We applied SAM and Limma to the
processed and normalized TCGA array—based gene expression data—
set using the samr (Tibshirani et (11., 2011) and Limma (Smyth,
2005) R packages from Bioconductor (Gentleman et (11., 2004). We
also applied edgeR to the RNA—Seq data of the subset of samples
with RNA—Seq data and genes that passed filtering (as described
above) using the edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) package from
Bioconductor.

Using the array—based gene—expression data, while the q-values
and adjusted p—values of SAM and Limma are highly correlated
(R : 0.98, Supplementary Fig. S6) with each other, the q-values and
adjusted p—values of SAM and Limma are only moderately corre—
lated with the q-values of EMD (R 20.59 and 0.53, respectively,
Supplementary Fig. S7). Overall, EMDomics identifies far more stat—
istically significant genes associated with drug resistance (475 genes
with q<0.05), as compared with SAM (23 genes) or Limma (2
genes) (lists of all genes with their EMD, SAM and Limma signifi—
cant values are in Supplementary File 2). While EMD identifies sig—
nificant genes across a wide range of fold—change values, significant
genes identified by SAM and Limma are limited to genes showing
at least moderate fold change in mean expression between classes
(Fig. 3(b); Supplementary Fig. S8).

EMDomics shows similar performance when using RNA—Seq
based expression values (normalized read counts). However because
of higher level of variability among read count data, less number of
samples and shorter gene list, EMDomics identifies fewer significant
genes (30 genes with q < 0.05) than were identified using the array—
based data. However, edgeR identified only one gene as significant
with q < 0.05 (CCND2) on the RNA—Seq data. CCND2 was also
identified as significant by EMDomics. The table including
EMDomics and edgeR results on the RNA—Seq data for the 8106
genes is provided in Supplementary File 3. The density plots of
CCND2 (which is called significant by EMDomics and edgeR),
IGF2 and PTN (which are called significant by EMDomics but not
by edgeR) and MKL2 (with edgeR q-value : 0.09, as compared with
EMDomics q value:0.58) is shown in Figure 4. While edgeR is
more sensitive to the genes that have a narrow read count distribu—
tion with a long tail (one or two samples have significantly more
read count compare to the rest of samples (Fig. 4(d)), EMDomics
identifies genes with read count distributions that are wide (high
intra—group heterogeneity) and significantly variable between groups
(Fig. 4(b) and (c)).

Since more samples and genes are available from the array—based
data as compared with the RNA—Seq data, the array—based data was
used for the functional gene set analyses. The 15 genes with the low—
est q-value in EMDomics (EMDomics q < 0.001) and highest
q-values in SAM (SAM q > 0.47) are listed in Supplementary Table
S2. All of these genes, but one, have been previously associated with
cancer (Alanen et (11., 2000; Basu and Roy, 2013; Brouwer—Visser

have been specifically implicated in ovarian cancer progression. For
example, GPC5 is associated with many cancers, including ovarian
cancer (Integrated genomic analyses of ovarian carcinoma., 2011),
suggesting its relevance to this biomedical problem; PITX2 has been
associated with ovarian cancer progression and malignant pheno—
types in both observational (Fung et al., 2012) and mechanistic
(Basu and Roy, 2013) studies; the IGF signaling pathway is associ—
ated with drug resistance in several cancers (Brouwer—Visser et al.,
2014; Huang et al., 2010; Pearce et al., 2011); and COL11A1 is
associated with poor outcome and resistance to cis—platinum in
ovarian cancer cell lines (Teng et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014).
Figure 5 shows the density plots of GPC5, PITX2, IGF and
COL11A1 for resistant and sensitive samples—the distributions of
gene expression values are wide within both the sensitive and
resistant classes (high intraclass heterogeneity), and there are clear
differences in the shapes of distributions between the sensitive and
resistant groups.

23 genes are called significant by SAM with q-value < 0.05 (T
S2). Each of these genes but four (TACSTD1, MSH6, SPCS2,
ZNF5 92) are called significant by EMDomics, as well.
Supplementary Figure S9 shows the density plots of these four genes
for resistant and sensitive samples. Among them, TACSTD1 and
MSH6 have been associated with cancer in the literature. For these
genes, the distributions of gene expression values in sensitive and re—
sistant samples are very narrow (low variance), which drives the
high test statistic and low q-value from the t—test in Limma and
SAM. MATN2 and LCTL were the only two genes called significant
by Limma at an adjusted p—value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table S3).
These two genes were both called significant by EMDomics, as well.
The density plots of four top genes (SERTAD4, LIPG, MATN2,
GJB1) called significant by both SAM and EMDomics are shown in
Supplementary Figure S10. These genes show differences in both
mean expression levels and distribution shape between sensitive and
resistant samples.

In summary, EMDomics identifies far more differentially ex—
pressed genes than SAM or Limma, and the genes prioritized by
EMDomics appear to be highly relevant for ovarian cancer biology.

To compare the robustness of differential expression results be—
tween EMDomics and SAM, we performed bootstrapping analyses
using both approaches. Across 100 bootstrap iterations and a

sensitive (blue) samples, using array-based expression value data from
TCGA

significance threshold of FDR:5% applied at each iteration, we
identify a median of 302 genes (95% confidence interval 171—5 83)
differentially expressed by EMDomics compared with a median of
only five genes (95 % confidence interval 0—45) by SAM. These re—
sults support the robustness of the observation that EMDomics is a
more powerful method than SAM for the identification of drug re—
sistance associated genes in ovarian cancer. Next, we used boot—
strapping to compare the ability of EMDomics and SAM to identify
genes that repeatedly attain statistical significance across the boot—
strap iterations. Across the 100 bootstrap iterations, we identify 125
genes with a median q-value < 5% with EMDomics, and we identify
no genes with a median q-value<5% using SAM. These results
show that EMDomics significantly outperforms SAM for the identi—
fication of genes with robust association with drug resistance in
ovarian cancer.

To compare the biological cohesiveness of genes prioritized by
EMDomics and SAM, we performed a comparative gene set enrich—
ment analyses on sets of top significant genes identified by the two
methods.

3.4 Enrichment analysis

3.4.1 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

We used the “Investigate Gene Sets” function of the web—based
GSEA tool provided by the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/gsea/msigdb/annotate.jsp) to assess overlap of genes called sig—
nificant by EMDomics and SAM (q-value < 0.05) and gene sets in
the Canonical Pathways (CP), KEGG database (CP:KEGG), and
oncogenic signatures (C6) in the Broad Institute’s Molecular
Signatures Database (MSigDB) (Total number of considered gene
sets: 1 509; 1320 gene sets for CP and CP:KEGG, and 189 gene
sets for C6). Using EMDomics, we identify 99 C6 gene sets and 10
CP and CP:KEGG gene sets, with q-value for enrichment<0.01.
Using SAM significant gene lists, we identify no significantly en—
riched gene sets.

The top 10 most significantly enriched gene sets identified by
EMDomics are listed in Supplementary Table S4. This list of most
highly enriched gene sets includes pathways known to play critical
roles in ovarian cancer pathogenesis. For example, TP53 mutations
occur in almost all high grade serous ovarian cancers (Integrated
genomic analyses of ovarian carcinoma., 2011) and altered TP53

function is known to play a central role in drug resistance in ovarian
cancer (Shelling, 1997). The most enriched gene set identified by the
EMDomics analysis is a set of genes down—regulated in cancer cell
lines with mutated TP5 3 (q—value : 9.33e — 14), suggesting the value
of EMDomics for prioritizing pathways highly relevant to drug re—
sponse in ovarian cancer. Other gene sets identified as highly en—
riched by the EMDomics analysis include gene sets related to: LEF1,
BMIl, KRAS, EZH2, and PTEN, and pathways related to cell—cell
junction organization, cell—cell communication, WNT signaling, and
extracellular matrix organization, each of which have been previ—
ously implicated in cancer progression.

Next, we repeated the comparative gene set enrichment analysis
using the exact same number of top—ranked input genes (n:475
genes) for EMDomics and SAM. With q—value < 0.05, the set of 475
significant genes identified by EMDomics is enriched for 31
Canonical and KEGG Pathways, while the set of 475 top—ranked
genes identified by SAM is only enriched for 21 Canonical and
KEGG Pathways. We also assessed the statistical strength of the
gene set enrichments for genes identified by EMDomics as compared
with those identified by SAM. Considering the top 20 ranked path—
ways, EMDomics identifies significantly stronger enrichments than
SAM (Wilcoxon test P : 2.5 X 1076, Fig. 6(a)). We observed similar
behavior for the oncogenic signatures enrichment analysis. 99 onco—
genic signatures gene sets are enriched at (q—value < 0.05) in the 475
top—ranked EMDomics genes, while only 39 oncogenic signatures
gene sets are enriched at this significance threshold in the 475 top—
ranked SAM genes. Considering the top 20 significant oncogenic
signatures, EMDomics again identifies significantly stronger enrich—
ments (Wilcoxon test P: 1.16 X 1077, Fig. 6(b)). The Box plots of
FDRs of enrichment analyses on genes identified as top—ranked by
only SAM or by only EMDomics, but not by both are provided in
the Supplementary Figure S11. These data show that EMDomics
outperforms SAM for the prioritization of genes enriched for onco—
genic signatures and biological pathways. The top 10 oncogenic sig—
natures and pathways enriched in: the 475 top—ranked genes by
SAM; the unique genes among the top—ranked EMDomics genes;
and in the unique genes among the top—ranked SAM genes are
shown in Supplementary Tables S5—S8, respectively.

3.4.2 Gene ontology processes, diseases by biomarkers and pathway
maps enrichment analysis

We used the MetaCore (http://thomsonreuters.com/metacore/) soft—
ware tool to perform enrichment analyses of: Gene Ontology (GO)
Biological Processes, Diseases by Biomarkers, and Pathway Maps
using the list of EMDomics significant genes (475 genes) and the list
of 475 top—ranked SAM genes. Similar to gene set enrichment

analysis described above, more GO Processes and Diseases by
Biomarkers (1368 GO Processes and 551 Diseases) are enriched in
EMDomics significant genes (with q—value < 0.05) compared to
those enriched in the 475 top—ranked genes by SAM (603 GO
Processes and 136 Diseases). Considering the top 100 enriched GO
Processes and Diseases, we observed that EMDomics identifies sig—
nificantly stronger enrichments (Wilcoxon P<2 X 10’20 for GO
Processes and Diseases by Biomarkers) compared to SAM (Fig. 7(a)
and (b)). The gene set enrichment analyses on genes identified as
top—ranked by only SAM or by only EMDomics, but not by both are
given in the Supplementary File 4 and Figures S12, S13, and S14.

Pathway Maps enrichment analysis of the EMDomics significant
genes yielded six enriched maps (with q—value<0.05), which in—
cludes: Angiotensin system maturation, WNT signaling pathway,
Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and PGE2 pathways in
cancer, which are all implicated in ovarian cancer progression
(Arend et al., 2013; Herr et al., 2013; Januchowski et al., 2014;
Polakis, 2000; Rask et al., 2006). The only map enriched by SAM’s
top—ranked genes (q—value< 0.05) is Cadherin—mediated cell adhe—
sion. A list of the significant enriched Pathway Maps from the
EMDomics significant genes is given in Supplementary Table S9).

Enrichment analysis of the top—ranked differentially expressed
genes, identified by EMDomics and by SAM, shows that EMDomics
has more power to identify biological gene sets and pathways differ—
entially expressed between two heterogeneous groups.

3.5 Comparison of EMDomics with conventional
distribution comparison methods

The Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) and Cramer Von Mises (CVM)
tests, which quantify the distance between two distributions, are
common nonparametric tests to compare two groups of samples. In
KS the test metric is the maximum distance between the two cumu—
lative distribution functions (CDFs); and it is invariant to arbitrary
monotonic differences between the two distributions. The KS test
differs from EMDomics, since EMD considers all the differences
(incorporating both quantity and distance of differences) between
two distributions, while KS measures only the maximum difference
between two CDFs. As expected, EMDomics shows more power
compared to KS to capture intra—class heterogeneity on both simu—
lated and real biological data. In simulated data KS performs simi—
larly to EMDomics when there is no intra—class heterogeneity (case 1
in Fig. 2). The AUC for KS in case 1 is 0.98. By increasing the intra—
class heterogeneity, KS fails to identify truly differentially expressed
genes. Its true positive rates for case 4 and 5 are 0. Supplementary
Figure S15 shows ROC curves for KS compared to EMDomics for
the five cases in Figure 2. Table 2 shows the AUCs, false positive

rates (FPRs) and true positive rates (TPRs) for a significance thresh—
old of q—value: 0.05. We applied KS to the ovarian cancer expres—
sion data for resistant and sensitive groups. KS identifies no
significantly differentially expressed genes with adjusted
p—value<0.05. Supplementary Figure S16 shows KS adjusted p—
values versus EMDomics q-values.

In CVM, the test metric is the sum of the squared values of dif—
ference between two CDFs. CVM is a special case of EMD; it is one
of the solutions for making two distributions even, but it is not guar—
anteed to be the optimal solution. Because it adds all the squared
values of differences between two CDFs, CVM tends to overestimate
the mutual similarity and it is not able to effectively handle partial
matches. To explore the CVM performance, we applied it to the
simulated and the real biological data. To compute q-values for
CVM, we used the same approach that we employed for calculating
q-values for EMDomics. Using simulated data, CVM shows com—
parable performance to EMDomics. The TPRs of CVM are very
close to those of EMDomics, however CVM generates more false
positives. While the FPRs of EMDomics are almost zero, CVM has
FPRs of about 4% (Table 2). This difference in FPRs results in
slightly lower AUC for CVM compared to EMDomics, as shown in
Table 2 and Figure S14. We also applied CVM to the ovarian cancer
gene expression data. CVM identified far more significant genes
(2991 genes) compared to EMDomics (475 genes) with
q-value < 0.05. All genes identified as significant by EMDomics are
called as significant by CVM as well. Thus, CVM and EMDomics
show similar overall performance on calling true positives on the
simulated data; however, given EMDomics’s lower rate of false
positives on the simulated data, EMDomics may represent a more
precise and conservative approach than CVM. The result of apply—
ing EMDomics, KS and CVM on the array—based TCGA ovarian
cancer is given in Supplementary File 5.

4 Discussion

In this work we proposed to use the distance between the distribu—
tions of expression values (for array—based data) or normalized read
counts (for sequence—based data) to identify differentially expressed
genes when there is a high level of heterogeneity between and within
the groups. We developed a new method (EMDomics), based on the
Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), for computing the distance between
the distributions of expression values or normalized read counts and
for the identification of genes significantly differentially expressed
between heterogeneous groups.

Conventional methods, such as t—test—based or Fisher exact test—
based approaches, perform well for the identification of genes differ—
entially expressed between homogeneous classes of samples.

However, many problems in biology and biomedicine contain sam—
ples that show both significant intra— and inter—class heterogeneity.
If the sources and structure of the heterogeneity are known ahead of
time, then they may be incorporated into the analysis using conven—
tional approaches (e.g. stratification, inclusion of an interaction
term); however, frequently the sources and structure of intra—group
heterogeneity are unknown. In these cases, failure to account for the
presence of intra—group heterogeneity will result in high intra—group
variance driving high p—values, even for genes that may truly be
associated with a biological class.

Our analyses, on both simulated and real data, show that con—
sidering whole distributions with EMDomics has more power to
capture heterogeneity and identify genes and gene sets that are ex—
pressed differently between two heterogeneous groups.

The EMDomics method has several strengths and limitations. Its
primary strength is that it is a robust non—parametric method, which
does not make any assumptions about the distributions or differ—
ences between the two classes being compared, and thus has signifi—
cantly more power than conventional approaches for identifying
differential Omics features between heterogeneous classes. Thus, the
method can be applied in a wide variety of settings to compare dis—
tributions of Omics data between two classes. A further strength of
the method is that efficient algorithms are available to compute
EMD (Rubner et al., 2000).

However, ‘there is no free lunch in statistics’ (Simon and
Tibshirani, 2014; Wolpert and Macready, 1997), and EMDomics
has a few limitations. First, EMDomics can currently only be used
for two class problems and cannot be used with quantitative or mul—
ticlass labels. Second, because EMD is based on comparing the
histograms of the two groups it requires at least a moderate sample
size (~30 samples per class) and will tend to perform poorly when
there are few samples. Third, a significant EMD value does not
allow any inference to be made regarding the direction or structure of
an association; it provides evidence that a gene is expressed differently
(in some way) between two classes, which can then lead to further fol—
low—up analyses and experimental studies to more precisely character—
ize the association and its clinical and biological significance.

Despite the method’s limitations, our data suggest that
EMDomics is a powerful new approach for identifying differentially
expressed genes between heterogeneous classes of samples.
Although we demonstrate one application of EMDomics, it can
apply to identify other genomics data types (such as copy number
variation data), as well as to other types of populations (such as
populations of single cell measurements). Given ongoing major
efforts to generate massive Omics datasets (ranging in scale from
single cell genomics to population—based Omics studies in molecular
epidemiology) to investigate a wide array of questions in bio—
medicine, we expect EMDomics to be a useful new tool for the
identification of genes and gene sets differentially expressed between
heterogeneous classes of samples.

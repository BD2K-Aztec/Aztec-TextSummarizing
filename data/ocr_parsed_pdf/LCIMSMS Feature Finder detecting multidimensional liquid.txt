ABSTRACT

Motivation: The addition of ion mobility spectrometry to liquid chro-
matography-mass spectrometry experiments requires new, or
updated, software tools to facilitate data processing.

Results: We introduce a command line software application LC-IMS-
MS Feature Finder that searches for molecular ion signatures in multi-
dimensional liquid chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry-mass
spectrometry (LC-lMS-MS) data by clustering deisotoped peaks with
similar monoisotopic mass, charge state, LC elution time and ion mo-
bility drift time values. The software application includes an algorithm
for detecting and quantifying co-eluting chemical species, including
species that exist in multiple conformations that may have been sepa-
rated in the IMS dimension.

Availability: LC-lMS-MS Feature Finder is available as a command-
line tool for download at http://omics.pnl.gov/software/LC-lMS-MS_
Feature_Finder.php. The Microsoft.NET Framework 4.0 is required to
run the software. All other dependencies are included with the soft-
ware package. Usage of this software is limited to non-profit research
to use (see README).

1 INTRODUCTION

In conventional proteomics, liquid chromatography (LC) separ-
ations are generally coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) to
increase analytical sensitivity and proteome coverage
(Washbum et al., 2001). More recently, ion mobility spectrom-
etry (IMS) has been added as an extra dimension of separation to
further enhance sensitivity (Baker et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2002;
Liu et al., 2004). Although several software programs are avail-
able for deisotoping and/or grouping related peaks (Bertseh
et al., 2011; Deutsch et al., 2010; Monroe et al., 2007) to aid in
the identiﬁcation of species (typically peptides or metabolites),

none are currently able to process LC—IMS-MS data. In this
regard, we introduce LC—IMS-MS Feature Finder, a software
application that enables researchers to discover possible molecu-
lar ion signatures in LC-IMS-MS data by reporting characteristic
features such as monoisotopic mass, charge state, LC elution
time and IMS drift time for use by downstream identification
software (Lamarche et al., 2013).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder is a command line software application for
clustering deisotoped peaks in LC-IMS-MS data. The workﬂow for this
software application is schematically depicted in Figure 1. The preferred
input ﬁle for the software application is a DeconTools (Jaitly et al., 2009;
Slysz et al., 2010) (http://omics.pnl.gov/software/DeoonTools.php) ‘isos’
ﬁle format. This comma-separated value ﬁle contains information about
deisotoped features from individual spectra for a single instrument ana-
lysis, including monoisotopic mass, m/z, charge state, LC elution time
and IMS drift time. A raw instrument data ﬁle is also required. Currently,
LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder only supports instrument ﬁles in Uniﬁed
Ion Mobility Frame (Beagley et al., 2009) ﬁle format, which is a
SQLite database format created at Paciﬁc Northwest National
Laboratory similar to the YAFMS (Shah et al., 2010) ﬁle format. We
note that ﬁles from commercially available IMS instruments are unsup-
ported at this time because of their unreleased format specification.
However, once corresponding application programming interfaces be-
come available for commercial ﬁle formats, the LC-IMS-MS Feature
Finder will be updated to support them.

In LC-IMS-MS data, multiple charges states of the same species have
distinct IMS drift times. To take advantage of this fact, the LC-IMS-MS
Feature Finder partitions the data by charge state to allow it to be pro-
cessed independently. By partitioning the data and using the
Microsoft.NET 4.0 Task Parallel Library (TPL), multiple data partitions
are processed on separate computing cores. The TPL automatically de-
tects the number of available computing cores and decides how to use
them to process the data in parallel. Processing the data in a parallel
fashion during the most computationally intensive steps signiﬁcantly
decreases the overall runtime. Moreover, by using the TPL, paralleliza-
tion is not hard coded in the software or part of the user-speciﬁed input;
instead, it is adaptable to any computing core structure. This adaptability
is especially important, as the IMS dimension adds an extra level of
complexity and signiﬁcantly increases the computational burden com-
pared with conventional LC-MS data processing.

LC-[MS-MS
Fig. 1. A ﬂow chart of the LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder software appli-
cation. The input data are the raw spectra in UIMF format and deiso-
toped data. The deisotoped data are clustered by monoisotopic mass and

LC elution time and tested for multiple conformations to create LC-IMS-
MS Features

An important component of LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder is the ability
to detect multiple conformations of a chemical species. The algorithm is
particularly useful when (i) a single molecular gas-phase ion species exists
in multiple structural conformations that have distinct IMS drift times
and (ii) two different molecular ion species co-elute in the IMS dimension.
In these cases, the intensity proﬁles are frequently not base-line resolved
but instead form a set of overlapping peaks, which hinders the ability to
accurately quantify each individual intensity proﬁle. To ensure the most
accurate representation of these proﬁles, LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder
returns to the raw data ﬁle to collect raw intensity values. Returning to
the raw data is essential to get the most accurate representation of these
proﬁles. The mixture of proﬁles is split into distinct intensity proﬁles that
will be quantiﬁed and reported separately in the output ﬁle. The individ-
ual intensity proﬁles reported are resolved using both the LC and IMS
dimensions, therefore creating distinct LC-IMS-MS Features. Future ver-
sions of LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder will explore the possibility of resol-
ving which of the two cases give rise to the multiple conformations.

The software application outputs a tab-separated value text ﬁle that
contains associated information about each molecular ion signature
detected: monoisotopic mass, m/z, charge state, LC elution time, IMS
drift time and abundance. The ﬁnal monoisotopic mass and m/z values
are weighted averages (based on intensity) of the monoisotopic mass and
m/z values of each deisotoped feature associated with a given signature.
The LC elution time and IMS drift time values are the time points at
which the signature exhibits the highest intensity. The output ﬁle can be
used by downstream software to cross-reference the detected molecular
ion species with a database of known ions to aid in identiﬁcation of the
ions contained in the dataset. More details about the software input,
output and conﬁgurable parameters are available in the supplementary
information.

3 CONCLU$ONS

LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder affords a stand-alone console
application that uses raw LC-IMS-MS data and deisotoped fea-
tures contained in the raw data to discover molecular ion signa-
tures. Results in the form of a ﬂat text ﬁle can readily be
imported into Excel or other data analysis tools for further ana-
lysis, as well as associated with a database of known molecular
ion species by using other downstream software applications.
LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder has been integrated into the accu-
rate mass and time (AMT) tag data processing pipeline for LC-
IMS-MS datasets at Paciﬁc Northwest National Laboratory
(Crowell et al., 2013). The utility of LC-IMS-MS Feature
Finder extends to a broad range of studies, including, but not
limited to, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics.

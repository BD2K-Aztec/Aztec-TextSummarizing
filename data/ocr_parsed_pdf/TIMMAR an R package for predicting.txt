Abstract

Summary: Network pharmacology—based prediction of multi—targeted drug combinations is
becoming a promising strategy to improve anticancer efficacy and safety. We developed a logic—
based network algorithm, called Target Inhibition Interaction using Maximization and Minimization
Averaging (TIMMA), which predicts the effects of drug combinations based on their binary drug—
target interactions and single—drug sensitivity profiles in a given cancer sample. Here, we report
the R implementation ofthe algorithm (TIMMA—R), which is much faster than the original MATLAB
code. The major extensions include modeling of multiclass drug—target profiles and network visual—
ization. We also show that the TIMMA—R predictions are robust to the intrinsic noise in the experi—
mental data, thus making it a promising high—throughput tool to prioritize drug combinations in
various cancer types for follow—up experimentation or clinical applications.

1 Introduction

Recently, a network pharmacology paradigm for anticancer drug
discovery has been proposed, with an aim of developing multi-tar-
geted drug combinations that consist of distinct chemical agents as a
promising strategy to improve treatment efficacy and safety (Al—
Lazikani et (11., 2012). Most mathematical models for predicting the
effects of drug combinations relies on empirical cellular dynamic
models, such as those based on signaling pathways or metabolic net-
works. These types of methods are hardly applicable for predicting
cancer-selective drug combinations due to lack of accurate kinetic
parameters for each cancer type (Sun et (11., 2013). Other methods
use the transcriptional responses of drugs, i.e. gene expression pro-
files before and after drug treatments, to predict drug combinations
(Zhao et (11., 2014). However, such drug-induced transcriptional
phenotypes are not routinely profiled in a typical high-throughput

drug screen, and thus provide limited translation potential in the
clinical settings.

We have developed a logic-based network pharmacology ap-
proach Target Inhibition Interaction using Maximization and
Minimization Averaging (TIMMA) for predicting the effects of drug
combinations in a given cancer cell sample (Tang et (11., 2013).
TIMMA combines drug-target interaction networks with single-
drug sensitivity profiles, derived either from individual cell line mod-
els (Barrettina et a1. 2012) or from patient-derived cell samples
(Pemovska et a1. 2013). The network algorithm starts by searching a
set of combinatorial targets that are most predictive of the single-
drug sensitivities. A drug combination is then treated as a combin-
ation of target inhibitions, the effect of which can be estimated
based on the set relationships with the target profiles of the drugs.
The outcome of the TIMMA model provides a list of predicted

2.4 Network reconstruction

The TIMMA—R predictions can be formulated as a complete truth
table, based on which the minimized Boolean expression is deter—
mined by the enhanced Quine—McCIuskey algorithm using the
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) package in R (Dusa,
2010). The minimized Boolean expression is a union of target com—
bination scenarios leading to the same (maximal) response. For net—
work visualization, we utilized a two—terminal graph, with series
and parallel components, to represent the predicted response of can—
cer survival signaling pathways (see Supplementary Material). With
the network reconstruction algorithm, TIMMA—R is able to produce
illustrative visualizations that facilitate the interpretation of the drug
combination predictions. The nested network format enables net—
work visualization and analysis in Cytoscape.

5 Conclusion

The TIMMA—R package will facilitate effective integration of
drug—target and drug sensitivity profiles which are becoming increas—
ingly available for the anticancer research. The package does not only
offer an efficient prioritization tool for selecting the most promising
drug combinations for further experimental testing, but also produces
data—driven hypotheses for their target interactions. Such network—
centric investigation of the underlying mechanisms of action in the
given cellular context will greatly improve our knowledge about the
functional cross—talks between parallel cancer signaling pathways to
be utilized in anticancer treatment applications.

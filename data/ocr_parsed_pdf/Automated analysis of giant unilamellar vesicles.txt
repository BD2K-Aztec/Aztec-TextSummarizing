ABSTRACT

Motivation: In order to obtain statistically relevant results, the study of
membrane effects at the single-vesicle level requires the analysis of
several hundreds of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), which becomes
a very time-consuming task if carried out manually. Complete and
user-friendly software for fast and bias-free automated analysis has
not been reported yet.

Results: We developed a framework for the automated detection,
tracking and analysis of individual GUVs on digital microscopy
images. Our tool is suited to quantify protein binding to membranes
as well as several aspects of membrane permeabilization on single
vesicles. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach by com-
paring alternative activation methods for Bax, a pore-forming protein
involved in mitochondrial permeabilization during apoptosis.
Availability and Implementation: The complete software is imple-
mented in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., USA) and available as a
standalone as well as the full source code at http://www.ifib.uni-tue

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) have become
powerful and widely used tools to study membrane processes
(Apellaniz et al., 2010a, b; Baumgart et al., 2003; Bleicken
et al., 2013a, b; Garcia-Saez et al., 2009; Jalmar et al., 2010;
Klose et al., 2010; Leduc et al., 2004; Roux et al., 2010; Schon
et al., 2008; Wollert and Hurley, 2010). Among other applica-
tions, GUVs are extensively used to investigate the mechanisms
of pore-forming molecules (Alam et al., 2012; Apellaniz et al.,
2010a; Bleicken et al., 2013a, b; Fuertes et al., 2010; Garcia-Saez
et al., 2009; Kawai et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2008; Praper et al.,
2011; Schon et al., 2008; Steringer et al., 2012; Tamba et al.,
2007; Tamba and Yamazaki, 2005, 2009; Wheaten et al.,
2013a, b). In previous work, we developed a GUV-based sin-
gle-vesicle method for the analysis of membrane permeabil-
ization (Apellaniz et al., 2009). The individual-vesicle integrity,
the permeabilization degree, the stability of the permeabilized
state, the binding of proteins to the membrane as well as the

kinetics of single-vesicle leakage can be successfully addressed
with this approach (Apellaniz et al., 2010a; Bleicken et al.,
2013a, b; Fuertes et al., 2010; Steringer et al., 2012).

However, to achieve high statistical accuracy, several hundreds
of GUVs per experiment need to be considered. The analysis of
GUV experiments is mostly carried out on digital microscopy
images using basic image processing techniques like measuring
mean pixel intensities on deﬁned regions of interest or quantify-
ing certain shape features (Alam et al., 2012; Apellaniz et al.,
2009; Bergstrom et al., 2013; Bleicken et al., 2013a, b; Garcia-
Saez et al., 2009; Mally et al., 2002; Tamba et al., 2007; van
Rooijen et al., 2010). Due to the high amount of vesicles, this
method usually turns out to be extremely time consuming and
can additionally suffer from subjective bias if carried out manu-
ally. The researcher might tend to select GUVs following certain
characteristics like size or degree of filling and thus introduce a
bias into the sample.

So far, integrated systems for segmenting large populations of
lipid vesicles are scarce in publishing research. Zupanc et a].
(2011) proposed a vesicle segmentation algorithm based on the
Markov random field model, which depends on a bright vesicle
rim and a generous intensity contrast between the inner and
outer region of the vesicle. This is hardly the case in permeabil-
ization studies since a reduced dye concentration and laser power
during image acquisition is required to not considerably affect
membrane properties.

We propose the Circular Hough Transformation (CHT), a
robust technique to ﬁnd circular patterns in images (Duda and
Hart, 1972), for the segmentation of GUVs and demonstrate its
efﬁciency on noisy real experiment images. To our best know-
ledge, this article presents the first complete and user-friendly
framework for the automated detection and analysis of large
GUV populations. It is suitable for an entire permeabilization
analysis, including kinetics and the size and stability of pores. In
addition, radial profiles for each vesicle can be used to acquire
quantitative information about protein binding to membranes.
The automatization is not only advantageous in terms of time
saying, but also guarantees an unbiased statistical analysis to the
highest possible extent. The software is therefore powerful not
only in detecting circular objects in microscopy images, but also
objects which moderately deviate from the circular shape. For
the analysis of movies, we implemented a tracking algorithm
which allows tracking of single vesicles, making the software
applicable to moving GUVs.

To validate the approach and demonstrate the applicability of
our program, we investigated the degree of individual vesicle

permeabilization induced by Bax under different activating con-
ditions. Bax is a member of the Bcl-2 family with a major role in
the regulation of apoptosis. It induces the permeabilization of the
outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) that releases cyto-
chrome c (cyt c) during apoptosis (Garcia-Saez et al., 2010).
Despite intense research, the mechanism of Bax-induced OMM
permeabilization is under debate. Previous studies showed that
the cleaved form of the BH3-only protein Bid activates Bax
(Chipuk et al., 2006; Kuwana et al., 2005; Letai et al., 2002; Li
et al., 1998). Furthermore, Bax activation has been shown to
occur in vitro by incubation with detergents, acid pH or high
temperature (Antonsson et al., 2000; Hsu and Youle, 1997, 1998;
Kuwana et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2000). But whether these
methods induce comparable Bax activation and pore activity
remains unknown. In this article, we compared the effect of
these four activating methods on Bax-induced membrane perme-
abilization at the single-vesicle level. Our results demonstrate
that all four methods efﬁciently activate Bax and yield compar-
able all-or-none pore activity on cardiolipin-containing GUVs.

2 GENERAL FEATURES

2.1 Pre-processing

Raw images as acquired under real conditions are usually
not optimally suited for segmentation but require some
pre-processing. Most GUV images have a poor contrast due to
low dye concentration and laser power (as usually desired to
avoid artifacts). On the other hand, the GUV-detection algo-
rithm is initialized by the detection of edges, which is best carried
out on a high-contrast image. Thus as a crucial step, contrast is
increased by linear mapping of a user-deﬁned gray-value interval
(1min; Imax) to the maximally representable grayscale range.
Values below [min are mapped to 0 and those above Imax to the
highest possible gray-value. Additionally, we found that slight
smoothing contributes to an increased detection performance.
From our experience, convoluting the image with a boxcar
ﬁlter to smooth out short-scaled noise works best on ﬂuorescent
microscopy images.

For high processing speed it is convenient to minimize the ﬁle
size as much as possible but a limit to this procedure is given by
the accuracy of object localization and gray-value determination.
On the image, even the smallest GUVs must have a size that is
much larger compared to the size of one pixel. In our experience
and considering typical GUV sizes, resizing to a resolution of
1.7 pixels/um seems to be a good choice. The applied resizing
mechanism is based on the bicubic interpolation.

2.2 Automatic detection of GUVs

The detection algorithm is based on the CHT, a model-based
method for the segmentation of circular shapes in images. The
CHT mainly consists of a voting process, where every point in
the image votes for a point in an accumulation array according
to a speciﬁc voting scheme. Image points belonging to a circular-
shaped object vote for the same point in the accumulation array,
leading to local maxima. The detection of circles is then reduced
to the task of detecting peaks in the accumulation array (see
Supplementary Material for a more detailed description of the
CHT).

Parallel to the classical CHT method provided by Matlab, we
use a variation of the Adaptive Hough Transform (Illingworth
and Kittler, 1987; Peng et al., 2007; Zupanc et al., 2010). Some
GUVs are detected only by one of both methods but based on
our experience we could not ﬁgure out if one of the methods
works generally better on our images than the other. The parallel
arrangement of both CHT algorithms maximizes the detection
efﬁciency by providing the set union of the individual results. In
case that one GUV is detected by both methods, one of the
counts is eliminated; the requirement for such discrimination is
that the distance between the center points is less than the sum of
the radii of both GUVs.

Figure 1B and C show the final accumulation array for a typical
GUV image (Fig. 1A) in 2D and 3D, respectively. The peaks
clearly indicate the positions of the GUVs. The tool is not only
restricted to detect perfectly spherical vesicles but can also deal
with objects which slightly deviate from the circular shape, for
instance ellipses. In Figure 1D we used one of the images obtained
from the same experiment as Figure 1A and stretched it by a factor
of 1.5 in horizontal direction. As a result, the GUVs appear as
ellipses instead of circles. Our tool detected 22 objects from which
two were false detections and two objects were missing.

The circle detection is the key process and the raw output,
consisting of center points and radii, can be used for several
kinds of pixel-based analysis. Our program is specialized to de-
termine mean intensities within circles as well as radial intensity
proﬁles, but the implementation of other analysis schemes is
straightforward.

2.3 GUV tracking in image sequences

When dynamic processes are of interest, time series can be re-
corded resulting in stack ﬁles with several frames, usually >100.
Normally, the vesicles change their position from frame to frame
due to Brownian diffusion. Moreover, GUVs can diffuse into or
out of the observed sample region, leading to a changing number
of detections among the frames. Particle tracking plays an im-
portant role in biosciences when time-lapse experiments are per-
formed on moving particles (Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos,
2005). We implemented a tracking algorithm to follow the move-
ment of single vesicles through the image sequence. The GUV-
detection algorithm is applied to each frame and yields a set of T
(total number of frames in the image sequence) matrices C’ with
rows [xp, ypEL, where N, is the total number of detected GUVs
in frame I and (xp, yp) are the coordinates of the center point of
one GUV. The tracking tool identiﬁes detection points corres-
ponding to the same GUV in subsequent frames.

Let 3 represent the set of detection points p,(i = 1, ..., N,) in
frame I and R a user-deﬁned integer parameter specifying how
many future frames are to be considered. For all sets
Rnr = 1,...,R, of detection points (1], where j: 1,...,N,+,. in
frame t+r, an association matrix Gf. is deﬁned as Gf.(i,}) = 1 if
p,- in frame I and qj in frame t+ r are produced by the same
vesicle and Gf,(i, j) = 0 otherwise. Every row and every column of
Gf, can contain maximally one entry of value 1, all others are 0.
The detection points 1),- and qj are associated to the same GUV if
the distance between their center points is smaller than for any
other possible association and is at the same time below a user-
deﬁned threshold.

Fig. 1. CHT is used to ﬁnd GUVs on confocal microscopy images. (A)
GUVs are detected automatically by applying the CHT. Each vesicle
detected is marked with a red cross. Scale bar: 100 um. Signal-to-noise
ratio: 25:1. The GUVs were prepared by electroformation (Angelova and
Dimitrov, 1986) and were composed of PC/CL (4:1) with <0.05% DiO
used as lipid marker. All images are single confocal images. The extension
of the focal volume in z-direction is 2pm. (B and C). In the detection
process, the accumulation array (matrix) has the same size as the original
image and contains real numbers which are initially all set to 0. The
voting process of the CHT leads to a pattern where maxima correspond
to the center positions of the GUVs. Detecting GUVs is reduced to the
task of ﬁnding maxima in the accumulation array. (D) The program is
also suitable to detect objects which are not perfectly round. By stretching
one of the images from the same experiment by a factor of 1.5 in hori-
zontal direction, the vesicles appear as ellipses. The automatic detection
yields a total amount of 22 identiﬁed objects in the shown image, from
which two were false detections, while two objects remained undetected.
The bright spots are MLVs containing lipids in their interior. Ideally, only
true GUVs contribute to the permeabilization result, while MLVs are
excluded from the analysis by thresholding the inner pixel intensity of
the vesicles in the membrane channel

If for one r>1 we have Gf.(i,}) = 1 but Gf.(i,}) = 0 for all
r/ = 1, ...,r — 1, it means that a GUV was successfully detected
in frame I and frame t+ r, but not in the intermediate frames.
Nevertheless we assume that the GUV is also present in the
intermediate frames but is missing in the result due to limited

detection efﬁciency. In this case, the missing detection points are
automatically added to the intermediate frames. The center point

39.14 of a missing vesicle in frame t+r/ is set to
3c,+,4 =X,+§(§c,+,.—§c,> and the radius R,+,./ to

R,“ = [(r — r/)R, + r/R,+,.]/r. Accordingly, we set Gf. (1,1) = 1
for all r/ = 1,...,r— 1.

Let t and t/ be frames, t/ >t. Then the one-elements of the
matrix product B,,/ =  G‘i connect the detection points be-
tween the two frames. B,,/ (1,1) = 1 means that the i-th detection
in frame I and the j-th detection in frame t/ are produced by the
same GUV.

2.4 Automated pixel-based analysis

Usually, when imaging GUVs, more than one ﬂuorophore is
used and thus the image ﬁle consists of stacks containing several
channels. In order to perform unbiased GUV detection, one
channel should contain the ﬂuorescence signal of the vesicle
membrane and the detection step is performed only in this chan-
nel. Once the center points and radii are obtained, they can in
principle be used for any kind of further pixel-based analysis on
the additional channels of the stack ﬁle. For the permeabilization
analysis, the percentage of GUV filling is given by
F“ — F0

P _ 100 x —Fm _ F0 (1)
where F“ and Fm“ are the average ﬂuorescence intensities inside
and outside a GUV, and F0 is the initial ﬂuorescence signal
inside the GUV or noise offset. Along this article, we will usually
refer to Fm“ as background and to F0 as offset.

The background as well as the offset is determined separately
for each channel and frame to preserve intensity variations across
the image. For the automated determination of the background
intensity, the algorithm first smoothes the image with a boxcar
ﬁlter of 1 / 50 of the original image size. The most frequent gray-
value in the smoothed image is reported as background intensity.
The offset is estimated by collecting pixel intensities within non-
permeabilized GUVs, as they provide regions where no free dye
but only noise contributes to the local ﬂuorescence intensity. To
keep GUV pixels separate from background and considering
typical GUV diameters, we smooth with a smaller boxcar
ﬁlter, having 1/90 of the original image size. The average over
the 1000 darkest pixels is reported as offset.

Unlike the detection which is performed on one speciﬁed chan-
nel, the analysis of percentage of GUV ﬁlling according to
Equation (1) is carried out on all channels. This allows for per-
forming a variety of analysis, like total permeabilization, perme-
abilization kinetics or estimation of pore stability and size
(Apellaniz et al., 2011; Bleicken et al., 2013 a, b; Steringer
et al., 2012). For example, the histogram of permeabilization
degrees of a GUV population provides insight into the mechan-
ism of pore formation, while the permeabilization kinetics can be
used to estimate the total permeabilized area per GUV.

Figure 2 shows some example measurements that can be ana-
lyzed with the presented program. Time-lapse image sequences
allow the observation of the GUV-filling process with time and
can be used to characterize the permeabilization kinetics
(Fig. 2A). The ability to read out intensities at the same position
in different channels can be mostly used for studying the stability

of the permeabilized state and estimating the pore size, as ex-
plained in Figure 2B. Moreover, the program analyzes the radial
profile of each vesicle, which provides mean pixel values along a
circle perimeter as a function of the radius. This function is suit-
able to quantify protein binding to GUV membranes. If the pro-
tein of interest, ﬂuorescently labeled, binds to the membrane, a
peak of ﬂuorescence intensity appears on the GUV boundary
(Fig. 2C).

The algorithm automatically discriminates multi-lamellar ves-

via the graphical user interface we provide (Supplementary
Figure S1) and are explained in detail in the user manual
which we provide together with the software. False detections
can be removed fast and easily by clicking on them and pressing
the Remove button. On the other hand, the user can manually
add undetected GUVs by dragging a mask over the region of
interest and deﬁning this region as a new GUV. Background and
offset intensities can be modiﬁed by hand at any time during the
analysis. Even when the data are already analyzed, a change in

Fig. 2. The automated GUV analysis tool is suited to analyze image sequences (movies) and multichannel images. In all cases, the detection of the GUVs
is performed on a user-selected channel. Generally, the membrane channel should be used for an unbiased detection. The mean pixel intensity is read out
on the obtained regions of interest (interior of vesicles) in all channels and frames. (A) Taking an image sequence during an experiment of GUV
permeabilization allows the observation of the ﬁlling kinetics. Here, two independent GUVs (red and blue) were observed every 20 s for 1000 s. Scale bar:
30 um. (B) The multichannel analysis can be used to characterize the pore size and pore stability. For pore size, two free dyes with different molecular
sizes are added simultaneously and the degrees of ﬁlling for both dyes are compared. Cyt c (12kDa) can be used as dye 1 and APC (105 kDa) as dye 2, for
instance (Bleicken et al., 2013b). For pore stability, different free dyes with similar chemical properties are added at different times during incubation. A
stable pore remains open once it is formed and allows the internalization of all dyes. To demonstrate the principle of the multichannel analysis, we used
here Alexa488 (dye 1) and Alexa633 (dye 2), which have the same size and were added at different time points, and analyzed 23 GUVs composed of PC/
CL (4:1) with <0.05% DiO. The fact that the permeability of the individual vesicles is essentially the same for both dyes indicates that the pores are
stable. If this were an experiment to test pore size, the conclusion would be that the pores are large enough to allow the entry of both dyes. To make a
statistically signiﬁcant conclusion, independent repetitions and a large number of vesicles (>100 per repetition) are needed. Scale bar: 30 um. (C) Radial
proﬁles are created for all GUVs in a user-deﬁned channel. The pixel intensity averaged over a circle perimeter (y-axis) is recorded as a function of the
circle radius (x-axis), starting at the GUV center point and reaching up to the doubled GUV radius. The radial proﬁles of a bright and a dark GUV are
shown as examples. Both vesicles have a radius of 20 pixels and the zero-position was set to the vesicle center. This method can be used, for instance, to
quantify protein binding to the membrane. Here, the radial intensity originates from DiO in the vesicle membrane. Scale bar: 10 um

3 METHOD VALIDATION

3.1 Finding an optimal set of parameters

We ﬁrst tested the performance of our tool for different param-
eter sets on a training image from the same experiment as used
for the evaluation in Figure 3. Therefore we compared the efﬁ-
ciency of the automatic GUV detection, namely the number of
correctly detected GUVs and the number of false detections (de-
tections which do not correspond to GUVs). For the permeabil-
ization study, only undistorted GUVs are desired to contribute
to the result, since they are well-deﬁned structures. No MLVs
should be included.

Table 1 shows the effect of the user-deﬁned parameters,
namely the contrast adjustment and the radius range, on the
detection result. A high contrast is favorable for a good detection
rate but exorbitant contrast enhancement would saturate a large
number of pixel values and reduce the detection performance. In
our experiments, we labeled the vesicle membrane with 0.05%
DiO and adjusted the laser power so that the GUVs can still be
seen on the microscope (307200 uVV). Under these conditions, we
found best if pixel values ranging from 0 to 30 (with 255 being
the highest pixel value) are mapped to the full representable
range of pixel intensity.

For the radius range, a default of 1&50 pixels is predefined in
the GUI and works best for GUVs prepared following the pro-
posed protocol (Angelova and Dimitrov, 1986) and an image
resolution of 2.4 pixels/um. In general, the minimum radius
should not be set below 10 pixels since it is not possible to meas-
ure the ﬂuorescence intensity within smaller GUVs with sufﬁ-
cient accuracy. On the other hand, choosing a maximum radius

 

 

>50 pixels is only recommended in the absence of small GUVs.
Otherwise, the CHT tends to misinterpret accumulations of small
vesicles as one huge GUV, if those accumulations have a roughly
circular shape. However, we did not observe this effect using the
default radius range.

MLVs are excluded from the analysis by a user-defined thresh-
old for the intensity of the vesicle interior in the membrane chan-
nel. To determine the most appropriate threshold value, we
measured typical MLV intensities using the manual tools pro-
vided in the GUI and arrived at a best value of 7 (total range is
(L255). Additionally, the user has the possibility to scale down
the size of all masks where the pixel intensity within the GUVs is
read out. We encourage the user to test for different scaling fac-
tors prior to saving the analysis result. Proper scaling will ensure
that no background pixels contribute to the result. For the train-
ing image, a scale factor of 0.45 was the best choice. Assuming a
homogenous dye distribution within the GUVs, an underestima-
tion of the scaling factor has no effect on the permeabilization
histogram. On the other hand, an overestimation will shift the
histogram towards high permeabilization values since back-
ground pixels are included in the masks.

Even when the best parameter set is found, some GUVs may
still remain undetected, which is mainly due to the following
reasons.

0 Brightness: one particular GUV may contain less dye on its
membrane than the majority of the vesicles in the image. As
a result, it shows less ﬂuorescent intensity and will probably
not be matched by the Hough Transformation. To avoid
this, the experimentalist should mix well the lipid

Fig. 3. Comparison of automated and manual GUV analysis. Five images like (A) with a total amount of 200 GUVs were used to compare the automatic
with the manual analysis. The internalization of free dye into the lumen of the individual vesicles indicates membrane permeabilization. In all cases, the
degree of GUV ﬁlling was determined based on the ratio of averaged inner and outer pixel intensity. The GUV images were generated after 90 min of
incubation with Bax. Scale bar: 100 um. Signal-to-noise ratio: 8:1. (B) Distribution of the degree of ﬁlling of the GUVs analyzed with three different
methods: (i) automatic: the parameters were optimized for best detection efﬁciency and the result was not corrected for false detections or missing GUVs; (ii)
semi-automatic: false positives were removed from the result of the automatic analysis; (iii) manual/corr.: undetected GUVs were added to the result of the
semi-automatic analysis. This corresponds to a complete manual analysis as it has been commonly used in GUV experiments up to now. The automatic
method provided 167 detections. Forty-seven detections were false positives and 80 GUVs remained undetected. (C) Comparison of the analysis time: the
automatic analysis is 20 times faster than the manual analysis. Corr. means the automatic analysis with subsequent removal of false positives and adding of
undetected GUVs. This method provides the same result as the manual analysis but is still around three times faster

A training image containing 133 GUVs from the same experiment as in Figure 3 was
used to compare the detection performance for different parameter sets. For con—
trast, the indicated range of intensity values is linearly mapped to the full range of
(F255. Radius range is given in pixel units (image resolution is 2.4 pixels/um). The
ﬁrst line shows the optimal parameter set, giving the best balance between high
number of detected GUVs and low number of false detections. Since it is easier to
manually remove a false detection than to add a missing GUV, we assign more
weight to the number of detected GUVs

composition with the lipophilic dye to achieve a homoge-
neous dye distribution. As the dye concentration is generally
low (<0.05% DiO, for instance), small differences in the
concrete amount of dye on the membrane is not supposed
to affect the permeabilization behavior of the GUVs. Thus,
no bias is expected when those vesicles remain undetected.

0 Size: the CHT requires a user-deﬁned radius range for the
search of circular objects. We recommend a range of 10 to
50 pixels for image resolutions of ~2.4 pixels/um and using
the electroformation protocol suggested in this manuscript
(Angelova and Dimitrov, 1986). Some large GUVs are
beyond this range and remain undetected, but can be
easily added manually. Anyway, they are not expected to
have a different permeabilization behavior compared to the
rest of the GUVs. However, in cases where proteins inﬂu-
ence the size of the GUVs, the software could add bias by
preferably analyzing a certain size range. This needs to be
considered by the researcher.

o Distorted shape: if carried out carefully, the electroforma-
tion produces circular GUVs. Otherwise, some vesicles de-
viate from the circular shape. As demonstrated in Figure
1D, our tool also detects distorted shapes like ellipses, but
with lower efficiency compared to circles. A slight deviation
from the circular shape should in principle not affect the
ability of vesicles to permeabilize. In some cases it is even
advantageous to exclude distorted GUVs from the analysis
(for example for the estimation of vesicle radii).

3.2 Comparison of manual and automatic analysis

The quality of the automated GUV detection and analysis was
evaluated using a set of images from real experiments. The
degree of membrane permeabilization was directly determined
by monitoring the entry of a dye into the lumen of the GUVs
initially devoid of dye (Fig. 4A). The extent of permeabilization
can be quantiﬁed for individual vesicles on the sample. This
allows the identiﬁcation of subpopulation effects, which is not

possible in traditional bulk experiments. To analyze the goodness
of our automated GUV analysis, we compared the extent GUV
permeabilization obtained in the experiments with three different
analysis methods: (i) automatic analysis without any manual
interaction except for eventual background/offset correction or
radius rescaling, (ii) a semi-automatic analysis which consists of
the first method followed by manual removal of false positives
and (iii) the second method followed by manual adding of miss-
ing GUVs. Note that the third analysis mode provides the same
result as a completely manual analysis since it includes all pos-
sible manual corrections. Figure 3 shows the direct comparison
of all three methods in terms of population analysis of the degree
of single GUV permeabilization, as well as the required analysis
time for a set of images containing GUVs after incubation with
inactive Bax. Totally, our test images contained 200 GUVs. The
permeabilization distribution differs only slightly among the
methods and in all cases leads to the same conclusions for
the experiment (Fig. 3B). In this comparison, the automatic
method provides a higher fraction of highly permeabilized
GUVs (with >90% filling degree) than the manual and the
semi-automatic methods. This is mainly due to false detections,
which do not correspond to vesicles but to background, thus
yielding a higher fraction of reputedly fully permeabilized GUVs.

Comparing the analysis time, we ﬁnd important differences
between the pure manual analysis and the three methods
making use of our tool (Fig. 3C). Without any manual correc-
tions, one can save ~95% of analysis time compared to the
manual analysis, while achieving a very similar result. Even for
full corrections, which provide the same result as the manual
analysis, one still saves ~70% of analysis time. From our results,
we estimate an averaged analysis speed for one image of around
80 GUVs per minute on a common desktop computer with
3.40GHz and 16GB RAM, compared to ~6 GUVs per
minute for manual analysis.

It is notable that this high level of accuracy is achieved by
detecting only 60% of available GUVs compared to the
manual analysis. In our evaluation experiment, the pure auto-
matic detection provided 167 GUVs; 47 of them were false posi-
tives and 80 GUVs could not be detected automatically. This
robustness of the method is due to the fact that the number of
GUVs belonging to a certain class (e.g. bin of 10% of degree of
filling as in our analysis) follows a Poisson distribution and, as a
result, the error of the measurement depends on the square root
of the number of GUVs. For this reason, in order to obtain high
statistical accuracy, not the fraction of detected GUVs is of im-
portance, but the absolute number of data points. From our
experience, analyzing ~100 GUVs per experiment is already suf-
ficient for a representative result. Adding more GUVs to the
analysis will cause only a slight increase in statistical accuracy,
which is in most cases irrelevant compared to the systematic
error of the individual experiment. In most applications, the
semiautomatic analysis is a good balance between fast processing
and accurate results.

3.3 Different methods of Bax activation yield similar
permeabilization of GUVs

We validated and demonstrated the applicability of the auto-
mated GUV analysis tool by testing the permeabilization of

GUVs induced by Bax using different methods of activation.
GUVs composed of pure PC or PC/CL (4:1) were visualized
using lipophilic dyes of different colors (DiO, green and DiD,
red), mixed in a buffer-containing free Alexa555 and Bax at
20 nM, and incubated under four different conditions
(Fig. 4A): (i) in the presence of cBid, (ii) in the presence of de-
tergent, (iii) at pH 5.5 and (iv) at T: 420C (experiments (i), (ii)
and (iii) were performed at room temperature). The experimental
details are described in the Supplementary Material.

By mixing GUVs of different lipid compositions, preferences
for certain membrane types can be directly assessed in a situation
closer to the coexistence of membranes in a cell. For all condi-
tions, we observed permeabilization of vesicles containing CL,
but not with pure PC, illustrating the effect of the mitochondrial
lipid CL on the membrane activity of Bax (Fig. 4B and C). It is
notable that with all activation protocols, similar all-or-none
permeabilization was observed. Comparable results were ob-
tained when CL was substituted by PG (data not shown), indi-
cating that rather than a speciﬁc CL effect, negatively charged
lipids are necessary and enough for Bax pore activity.
Supplementary Figure S3 shows the corresponding control
experiments.

Our results suggest that all four methods of Bax activation
promote a similar mechanism of pore formation. This all-or-
none mechanism is likely associated with a cooperative transition
from a closed to an open state.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we presented a computationally efﬁcient and
robust method for the detection and analysis of GUVs based
on the CHT. The algorithm is not intrinsically limited to
GUVs. In principle, giant vesicles produced from the plasma
membrane of cells or any other circular objects can be detected
according to the applicability of the CHT. Even distorted

circular objects can be segmented and analyzed with our tool.
It can be used for quantitative studies of vesicle size, membrane
permeabilization and protein binding on a single-vesicle level.
Also time-lapse analysis can be performed even if the vesicles
move during the measurement time. We showed that the auto-
mated-GUV-analysis platform is of high accuracy on noisy real
microscopy images taken usually at low laser power and low dye
concentration. The results obtained from the analysis of experi-
ments of GUV permeabilization using our application were
comparable to the results obtained in a time consuming
manual analysis. Even if the automatic analysis was comple-
mented by manual corrections to match all available GUVs,
the time saving is still ~70% compared to a complete by-hand
analysis. The reduced analysis time is of special importance in a
single vesicle approach since a high number of GUVs is needed
for statistical accuracy.

To validate the application in a real situation, we used it to
study GUV permeabilization induced by Bax activated by cBid,
detergent, acid or heat. Histograms of permeabilization values of
a GUV ensemble are characteristic for the molecular mechanism
forming the basis of membrane permeabilization. We observed
that all four methods yield all-or-none permeabilization of CL-
containing membranes, indicating that regardless the method of
activation, the mechanism of pore formation by Bax is
maintained.

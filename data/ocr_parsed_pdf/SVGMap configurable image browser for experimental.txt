ABSTRACT

Summary: Spatial data visualization is very useful to represent
biological data and quickly interpret the results. For instance, to
show the expression pattern of a gene in different tissues of a fly, an
intuitive approach is to draw the fly with the corresponding tissues
and color the expression of the gene in each of them. However,
the creation of these visual representations may be a burdensome
task. Here we present SVGMap, a java application that automatizes
the generation of high-quality graphics for singular data items (e.g.
genes) and biological conditions. SVGMap contains a browser that
allows the user to navigate the different images created and can be
used as a web-based results publishing tool.

Availability: SVGMap is freely available as precompiled java
package as well as source code at http://bg.upf.edu/svgmap.
It requires Java 6 and any recent web browser with JavaScript
enabled. The software can be run on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modern biological experiments generally generate big datasets that
need to be visualized effectively in order to interpret the results.
Some available tools for genomic data analysis focus on representing
huge datasets in one ﬁgure using visualization techniques like heat
maps and circular plots (Krzywinski et (11., 2009; Perez-Llamas and
Lopez-Bigas; Pritchard et (11., 2006).

This focus on big data should not leave out the development of
tools to represent singular data, for example representing expression
of a single gene. In such cases, the viewer can be provided with
ﬁgures that are more straightforward to understand, like a textbook
ﬁgure. Particularly, ﬁgures in SVG format, the W3C standard to
design high-quality images and graphics, are well suited for the
graphical representation of biological data.

With SVGMap, we present a tool that is well ﬁtted for
the visualization of biological data through the generation of
individualized ﬁgures in a generic and interactive way. It is a
standalone Java application and can be executed on any system with

Java 6 or higher installed. The software instantiates a web server that
can be accessed through common web browsers. SVGMap can be
executed on a personal computer or can be incorporated into an
existing web server optionally using an external database.

2 BASIC USAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION

SVGMap requires two different kinds of inputs from the user: (i) an
Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) image ﬁle and (ii) a tab separated
mapping ﬁle. Optionally, the user can also provide another tab
separated ﬁle with annotations for each item (e.g. synonyms for
the genes, descriptions, etc). We refer to an entity of these ﬁles as an
experiment. The user is responsible to provide the SVG image for
the application. It may have to be created from scratch or an existing
image that was published in public domain may be reused.

Since SVG is a markup-language format, like the more popular
HTML and XML, different objects (regions) in the SVG image can
be annotated with region IDs. The regions are freely deﬁned areas in
the SVG image and their IDs will be used to map values of items (e. g.
gene expression values) to the region in question using the mapping
ﬁle. This relation can be used to dynamically map the values of
a measurement to a certain region on the SVG image and color it
accordingly. We use Batik SVG Toolkit to automatically generate
SVG images (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik).

The mapping ﬁle contains three or more columns. The ﬁrst column
indicates a region ID in the SVG image. The second column the item
(e. g. gene name), and all further columns contain values of that item
in the corresponding region for a certain condition.

The graphical user interface (GUI), the SVGMap browser, is
a web server that consists of a restricted administration section
and an unrestricted browser section. The administration section is
designed for creating, deleting and conﬁguring experiments. For
each experiment, the user must upload an SVG image, the mapping
ﬁle and optionally the annotation ﬁle. Some conﬁgurable options
are available, such as selecting which type of color scale (P-value,
linear or linear two-sided) will be used, which color range and which
values of the mapping ﬁle will be selectable. More information
about the experimental conditions can be represented in the title
and description ﬁelds of the experiment. The unrestricted browser
section lets the users browse the data in a sortable and searchable
table where data to be visualized in the image can be selected. It
also allows the user to adjust the scales to be used and the range and
colors. After having generated a ﬁgure via the SVGMap browser, a
ZIP folder is offered for download, which includes the selected data,
the generated ﬁgures and the scale. The workﬂow is represented in
Figure l.

Fig. 1. From left to right: the SVG image and the data are loaded into the
SVGMap Via its GUI, the SVGMap browser. In the SVGMap browser, the
user selects the desired data and adjusts for color and data range in order to
generate the ﬁgure. Repeating this step for other selection results in more
ﬁgures, each of which can be downloaded in SVG format, including the scale
and the data ﬁle corresponding to the image.

Apart from the SVGMap browser, advanced users can also use the
SVGMap package for batch generating data-annotated images with
the command-line package, documented on the project’s website.

3 DISCUSSION

The development of SVGMap and its SVGMap browser was
motivated to cover the need we had in collaboration with an
experimental group to support the study of gene expression in
Arabidopsis thaliana roots, but has been programmed in a generic
manner, such that it can be adapted to any other data types. Our
tool helped them to study their genes of interest and gave insight in
which tissue they are expressed and with which level of expression.
Furthermore, it serves as well as a platform for the publication of
their data and images. In this collaboration, SVGMap has been
proved to be straightforward and very useful. In our opinion,
SVGMap has a wide range of applications to represent biological
data. To illustrate that we have prepared four diverse examples:
(i) visualization of expression levels of yeast cell cycle genes in
each part of the cell cycle (M,G1,S,G2) (Rustici et (11., 2004); (ii)
visualization of copy number variation data for 10 different types of
cancer from IntOGen data (Gundem et (11., 2010); (iii) visualization
of gene expression in different Drosophila tissues from FlyAtlas
(Chintapalli et (11., 2007) and (iv) visualization of cell compartments

affected by transcriptomic alterations in 10 cancer types (Gundem
et al., 2010).

With the ﬂexible SVG format as basis of our tool, it is
important to stress that SVG images can be reused and adapted
because the graphics are described by text. Any SVG that has
been published in public domain, like the Wikimedia documents
(http://commons.wikimedia.org), can be loaded in a SVG editor in
order to add or remove objects and annotate them.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we have presented SVGMap, an intuitive tool, which
aims to help researchers in the visualization and generation of high-
quality images for singular data items.

The whole code of SVGMap including its examples has been
released as open source and may be freely downloaded and reused.
We also welcome and encourage contributors to ideas and code.

A function that generates this deﬁnition ﬁles from an Systems Biology
Markup Language (SBML) ﬁle is provided. The deﬁnition ﬁles are used
to generated a set of ODEs using the Matlab symbolic toolbox.
Equations are then solved using the Matlab ODE solver, and solutions
provide the variance decomposition. Functions to providing graphical
output are also implemented.

2.2 Applicability

The package assumes that the LNA is a reasonable approximation of
modelled systems. Generally, this is the case if the number of each of the
interacting reacting molecules is large and the system is monostable.
Detailed discussions on the validity of the LNA are presented in
Ramaswamy et a]. (2012) and Wallace et a]. (2012). Accounting for
this limitation, the tool allows us to take any modelled network and
efﬁciently calculate the contribution each reaction makes to the variabil-
ity in all concentrations, speciﬁcally (i) symbolically generate ODEs
describing the system and individual reaction contributions, (ii) numeric-
ally compute variance decomposition and visualize obtained results and
(iii) infer contributions of individual reactions from experimental data if
posterior distribution is provided. The ﬂow chart describing inputwutput
relationship of the package is presented in Figure 1.

2.3 Biological relevance

Using experimental data of Swameye et a]. (2003), we inferred the sources
of variability in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. First, we used the

Fig. 1. Input-output ﬂow chart of the StochDecomp package. The stoi-
chiometry matrix, reaction rates and initial parameter guesses, which
deﬁne the stochastic model, are translated by means of the symbolic
computations into the set of deterministic ODEs (see Supplementary
Material for details). Conversion from SBML is also implemented.
Stored ODEs are then used to numerically analyze the stochastic
model, particularly decompose the variability into contributions resulting
from each of the model reactions either in steady-state or out-of-steady-
state. Though not explicitly stated, the covariance matrix 2 and contri-
butions E“) depend on the parameter vector 6. Therefore, if experimental
data together with parameter posterior are available, individual contri-
butions can be inferred along with the parameters

Prediction Uncertainty Analysis (PUA) Matlab package (Vanlier et 01.,
2012) to generate posterior distribution of model parameters as described
in Vanlier et a]. (2012). Second, the parameter posterior was translated by
our package into a posterior of noise contributions. The tool revealed the
following insight about variability in the nuclear concentration of STAT
complexes, which is a factor activating a downstream response: (i) in the
absence of extrinsic noise, the ﬂuctuations in the number of nuclear
complexes originate largely from trafﬁcking of the complexes into the
nucleus. (ii) In the presence of the extrinsic noise, understood as ﬂuctu-
ations in Epo concentration, the network acts as a low pass ﬁlter. The
extrinsic noise is major source of variability if the fluctuations in Epo
concentration are slow. (iii) The overall variability of the nuclear concen-
tration of STAT complexes is relatively insensitive to parameters.
Contributions of certain reactions, however, are sensitive and change
by an order of magnitudes for the parameters within the posterior (see
Supplementary Material for details).

3 DISCUSSION

StochDecomp is a novel computationally efﬁcient and integra—
tive Matlab package for computational analysis of noise origin in
the stochastic models of biochemical reactions. The ability to
dissect noise propagation through biological systems does
enable to better understand the role of noise in function and
evolution, and will also help synthetic biologists to either harness
or dampen the effects of noise in molecular signalling and
response networks.

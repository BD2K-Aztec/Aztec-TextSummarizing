ABSTRACT

Motivation: Exome sequencing technologies have transformed the
field of Mendelian genetics and allowed for efficient detection of geno-
mic variants in protein-coding regions. The target enrichment process
that is intrinsic to exome sequencing is inherently imperfect, generat-
ing large amounts of unintended off-target sequence. Off-target data
are characterized by very low and highly heterogeneous coverage and
are usually discarded by exome analysis pipelines. We posit that off-
target read depth is a rich, but overlooked, source of information that
could be mined to detect intergenic copy number variation (CNV). We
propose cnvOffseq, a novel normalization framework for off-target
read depth that is based on local adaptive singular value decompos-
ition (SVD). This method is designed to address the heterogeneity of
the underlying data and allows for accurate and precise CNV detection
and genotyping in off-target regions.

Results: cnvOffSeq was benchmarked on whole-exome sequencing
samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. In a set of 104 gold standard
intergenic deletions, our method achieved a sensitivity of 57.5% and a
speciﬁcity of 99.2%, while maintaining a low FDR of 5%. For gold stand-
ard deletions longer than 5 kb, cnvOffSeq achieves a sensitivity of 90.4%
without increasing the FDR. cnvOffSeq outperforms both whole-genome
and whole-exome CNV detection methods considerably and is shown to
offer a substantial improvement over nai've local SVD.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of whole-exome sequencing (WES) has led to a renais-
sance in the ﬁeld of Mendelian genetics (Bamshad et al., 2011;
Hoischen et al., 2010; Ng et al., 2010a,b). WES offers deep coverage
for protein-coding regions at a lower cost than whole-genome
sequencing (W GS) and has thus sparked renewed interest in elucidat-
ing rare diseases. Exome sequence analysis typically focuses on de-
tecting previously unobserved (or very low-frequency) coding single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small frame-shift indels that
are absent from a reference set. This approach is based on the prior
hypothesis that such loss-of—function mutations are more likely to
cause severe phenotypic effects commonly seen in rare diseases. A
number of studies have also identiﬁed exonic copy number variation
(CNV) as the underlying genetic basis for various Mendelian dis-
orders (Lango Allen et al., 2014; Rohrer et al., 2013).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Exome-based CNV detection is complicated by the presence of
strong batch effects introduced by the enrichment process.
Various approaches have been developed to detect, genotype
and perform association testing on exonic CNVs in population
exome datasets (Coin et al., 2012; Krumm et al., 2012;
Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011). The majority of these approaches
operate under the assumption that most of the variation in read
depth (RD) is driven by systematic bias which swamps the real
signal in global noise. Exome CNV methods attempt to mitigate
such bias either through control-based normalization or by iden-
tifying and removing the strongest components of variation
across the population.

Most exome sequencing technologies rely on a hybridization
step to enrich for DNA fragments arising from specific genomic
targets. Hybridization is a sensitive but imperfect process that
captures large amounts of off-target fragments along with the
intended exonic regions. Although hybridization efﬁciency is
highly variable and platform-specific, off-target sequence has
been consistently shown to comprise as much as 50% 0f
whole-exome datasets (Hedges et al., 2011). Despite its potential
to generate high-quality SNP genotypes in non-coding regions
(Guo et al., 2012), non-target reads are almost always treated as
a contaminant and ignored by exome analysis pipelines. We pos-
tulate that off-target data are a rich, but overlooked, source of
information that could be mined to detect intergenic CNV.

The off-target sequence coverage from a WES experiment can
range from 0.5x to 3x. We have previously shown (Bellos et al.,
2012) that it is possible to accurately identify and genotype
CNVs longer than lkb from low-coverage WGS data, which
itself can be as little as 2x coverage. Despite the similar levels
of coverage, analysis of off-target exome sequence data is con-
founded by the highly uneven nature of off-target coverage. The
mechanism behind off-target enrichment is highly complex and
contingent on both sequence properties and stochastic processes.
Different parts of the genome are subject to distinct biases, such
that off-target RD behaves like a combination of whole-genome
and whole-exome data and cannot be handled uniformly.

To address the heterogeneity of off-target sequencing cover-
age, we have developed a dynamic RD normalization pipeline
called cnvOffSeq. The pipeline is based on a modified version of
singular value decomposition (SVD) that allows for ﬂexible,
region-specific noise reduction and signal enhancement. Global
(or exome-wide) SVD has been established as a robust frame-
work for on—target RD normalization and CNV calling using
WES data. Here we propose a local adaptive SVD approach
for detection and genotyping of intergenic CNVs based solely
on off-target reads of WES experiments. In principle, introns
could also be analysed using our framework, but we focused

on intergenic regions to avoid contamination from exome
targets.

2 METHODS

2.1 Local adaptive SVD

The enrichment step that is essential for most targeted sequencing technol-
ogies gives rise to biases that heavily affect the depth of coverage. The re-
sulting read depth is highly variable across target regions, rendering CNV
detection problematic. Global SVD can alleviate the effects of enrichment
bias and has formed the basis of numerous WES normalization strategies for
CNV identiﬁcation (Fromer et (11., 2012; Krumm et (11., 2012). In this para-
digm, the noise is assumed to be non-random and highly correlated across
samples, as the confounders (such as capture speciﬁcity and capture probe
design) are shared among them. Therefore, by exome-wide application of
SVD and elimination of the strongest singular components, CNV methods
can effectively de-noise RD and achieve accurate segmentation.

Contrary to on—target exome data, of f—target reads are unintentional by-
products of the enrichment technologies and are thus subject to a mixture
of sequencing biases that are highly variable and dependent on genomic
context. Due to the repetitive nature of the human genome, some non-
coding regions may be enriched if they have a certain degree of homology
with exonic sequence. Such off-target regions will share properties with on-
target data and exhibit a similar pattern of highly correlated noise.
Hybridization-based whole-exome enrichment involves a washing step to
remove uncaptured and poorly hybridized fragments. The efﬁciency of this
washing step varies according to the desired level of hybridization strin-
gency and can therefore also introduce varying amounts of off-target se-
quence into the results. In this case, the off-target noise is expected to be
random and decorrelated among samples due to the stochastic nature of its
origin. Consequently, off-target data are highly diverse and not amenable
to global normalization approaches that treat noise as either entirely
random or entirely correlated. To that end, we introduce a localized vari-
ant of the SVD, which segments the non-coding genome according to the
observed RD noise pattern (Fig. 1). To maintain contiguity and facilitate
CNV calling, we retain the coding regions in our analysis but substitute
their RD with the genome-wide off-target coverage.

Our normalization framework divides the non-coding genome into
regions with distinct RD noise proﬁles through an iterative application
of SVD to genomic windows of varying size:

01

RD_Wind0Wsizexswnples = Uzw = U E i ’ . 5 V*

The columns of matrix U represent the left-singular vectors, the rows
of V* represent the right-singular vectors and Z is a diagonal matrix that
contains the singular values in decreasing order. Each normalization
window shrinks repeatedly by 100 bp until it achieves a local maximum
for the largest singular value, 01. When such a maximum has been de-
tected, we have identiﬁed the most ‘singular’ or degenerate region and the
window shifts forward by the size of the shrunken window and repeats
the process until the whole genome is covered. The resulting segmentation
provides the means for differentiating between regions of correlated and
random noise. This can be achieved by examining the relative contribu-
tion of each region’s maximum singular value as deﬁned by

RC,” ﬁll/Em,

The larger the contribution the more likely the region resembles an
exonic target with a highly consistent noise pattern across samples. The
lower the contribution, the more randomly distributed the noise will tend

to be across samples. We applied heuristic thresholds of 30 and 70% for
the RCal to deﬁne three region classes:

0 If RCU1<30%, then the noise appwrs to be random and highly rep-
resented in the lower singular components. Thus, we normalize these
regions by keeping the ﬁrst singular component and eliminating the
rest.

0 If 30% 5 RCal 5 70%, the noise remains mostly random but there
appear to be some signs of some systematic bias. Thus, we eliminate
all but the ﬁrst two singular components.

0 If RCU1>70%, then the RD is dominated by systematic bias and is
therefore normalized by removing the ﬁrst singular component fol-
lowing the paradigm of WES normalization.

The local RD matrices are then reconstructed using either the trun-
cated or the modiﬁed )3 matrix to obtain the ﬁltered signal that can now
be used for CNV detection.

2.2 Data modelling and CNV calling

Following normalization, we use the hidden Markov model (HMM)
framework described in caniTSeq (Bellos et (11., 2012) to perform

CNV segmentation and genotyping. Like its predecessor, cnvOffseq
models the RD at the population level to achieve optimal results. The
observed continuous RD is considered to be generated by the hidden
underlying discrete copy number states. The emission distribution of
RD is modelled using the negative binomial distribution to account for
its documented overdispersed nature (Bentley et al., 2008). The transition
probabilities of our HMM are determined by the combination of a global
transition rate matrix and a local transition rate, to capture the overall
transition between copy number states across the region as well as pos-
ition-speciﬁc changes. Despite the substantial de-noising achieved
through our local adaptive SVD, the very low off-target coverage com-
bined with the high RD variability informs a more stringent prior on the
transition rate than previously used for WGS. As previously described,
the parameters of the HMM are estimated using a generalized expect-
ation-maximization algorithm and the most likely CNV segmentation for
the trained model is obtained by the Viterbi algorithm.

2.3 Samples and datasets

Our normalization method was developed and evaluated using whole-
exome sequencing samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. We only
considered samples for which the 1000 Genomes consortium has also
generated genome-wide CNV calls, based on the low-coverage and trio
phase datasets. Furthermore, we excluded samples that exhibited off-
target coverage <lx. The aforementioned criteria were fulfilled by 50
samples spanning 7 populations (Supplementary Table S1) that were
sequenced either by the Broad Institute (BI) or Washington University,
Genome Sequencing Center (WUGSC). For target enrichment, BI used
the Agilent SureSelect All Exon assay, while WUGSC also used the
NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome assay. The samples were sequenced
either on Illumina Genome Analyzer II or HiSeq 2000 using a paired-
end protocol, with the insert size varying between 100 and 400 bp across
samples. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome
(assembly NCB137) using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009). Because we
are interested only in off-target data, we excluded regions that were re-
ported as captured by either enrichment assay along with the surrounding
Skb to avoid possible contamination. In our 50 samples, the resulting
on-target coverage ranges from 49x to 248x with a mean of 96x, while
the off-target coverage ranges from 1.07x to 2.66x with a mean of 1.97x.
Our off-target CNV calls were compared against the 1000 Genomes
gold standard set of genotyped deletions that were created by
combining the predictions of ﬁve computational methods to maximize
conﬁdence.

2.4 cnvOffSeq implementation

cnvOffSeq is implemented as a collection of JAR-packaged Java tools
and UNIX shell scripts. The main input of the algorithm is BAM align-
ment ﬁles, which are then pre-processed using SAMtools (Li et al., 2009).
cnvOffSeq also requires the coordinates of targeted coding regions (to be
excluded) in BED format. Such ﬁles are typically provided by capture
assay vendors. cnvOffSeq produces normalized RD ﬁles in text and
binary format that can be disentangled from our CNV calling pipeline
and used by third party segmentation algorithms. When used in conjunc-
tion with our HMM framework, cnvOffSeq generates CNV calls in text
format and optional segmentation plots. The sampling density of RD is a
user-speciﬁed parameter that determines the CNV breakpoint resolution
and the computational requirements of the algorithm. At the default
high-resolution setting of 100 bp, the normalization of chromosome 6
in 50 samples required 4GB of memory and one hour of processing
time. The software is freely available from http://sourceforge.net/p/
cnvoffseq.

3 RESULTS

cnvOffSeq’s performance was benchmarked against chromo-
some 6 gold standard deletions for 50 WES samples. We
excluded CNVs located less than 5kb from the nearest gene
target as well as CNVs overlapping regions that were blacklisted
by the ENCODE project for anomalous RD patterns. We also
eliminated gold standard deletions for which none of the 50 sam-
ples passed quality control. Our CNV detection resolution is
limited by the very low off-target coverage, so we only considered
events larger than 500 bp. The ﬁnal gold standard dataset con-
sisted of 104 deleted regions harbouring 497 conﬁdent
calls across all samples (Supplementary Table S2). These dele-
tions range from 606 bp to 69 281 bp with a median length of
2375 bp.

3.1 Normalization

First we sampled our RD data every 100 bp and calculated the
off-target coverage for each sample. Then we applied the local
adaptive SVD with a starting window size of 50 kb and a min-
imum window of 2.5 kb. Our dynamic normalization framework
divides chromosome 6 into 5354 segments with an average length
of 32.5 kb. 582 of these segments, amounting to almost 1Mb of
sequence, exhibit highly correlated RD patterns across samples.
These segments resemble on—target data and are dominated by
systematic bias, which can be mitigated by removing the first
singular component (Fig. 2b). The remaining segments are af-
fected by varying degrees of random noise and would suffer from
loss of actual signal if normalized the same way (Fig. 2b).
Instead, such segments are de-noised by eliminating low-order
singular components (Fig. 2c). Consequently, global SVD meth-
ods developed for exome sequencing tend to over-correct off-
target RD (Fig. 2b), while low-order component filtering tends
to under-correct the most outlying observations (Fig. 2c).
Depending on the local RD proﬁle our adaptive SVD algorithm
applies either ﬁrst component ﬁltering or low-order compo-
nent ﬁltering, thus combining the best of both worlds (Fig. 2d).

3.2 Benchmark

Because off-target regions comprise the majority of the
genome, we ﬁrst set out to compare cnvOffSeq with CNV
methods designed for WGS. WGS approaches largely rely on
accurate depth of coverage estimations to obtain a baseline for
comparison. This is problematic in our case, as the on—target
coverage is at least an order of magnitude higher than the off-
target. Thus, the genome-wide coverage calculation is con-
founded by the on-target read depth, leading to coverage esti-
mates that are too high for off-target regions and too low for
on—target regions. One plausible solution is to exclude exome
target regions from the calculations, but this is not trivial for
most existing WGS methods. In fact, when we applied
CNVnator (Abyzov et al., 2011) to our whole-exome dataset,
the results reﬂected the skewed coverage estimation, as most of
the genome was deemed either deleted or duplicated in every
sample. Therefore, to ensure an accurate and fair comparison
we modiﬁed our previously described WGS framework,
caniTSeq, to accommodate discontiguous RD datasets,
such as those represented by whole-exome off-target analyses.

caniTSeq utilizes LOESS smoothing and GC/alignability cor-
rection to mitigate sequencing biases, but relies on the same
HMM framework as cnvOffSeq. Thus, by comparing
caniTSeq with cnvOffSeq we provide a benchmark of ‘naive’
smoothing versus local adaptive SVD. Although caniTSeq
detects only 26 gold standard deletions fewer than cnvOffSeq
(55.0% versus 57.5% sensitivity), it suffers from much higher
rates of false-positive calls (82.7% versus 5.0% false discovery
rate), resulting in considerably lower accuracy (Table 1). This
demonstrates the advantage of local adaptive SVD in
minimizing aberrant CNV calls while enhancing the true RD
signal (Fig. 3).

Next, we examined the performance of CoNIFER (Krumm
et al., 2012), as a representative of the global SVD approaches
for whole-exome CNV detection. Like all exome CNV methods,
CoNIFER requires an explicit list of target coordinates to func-
tion. In order to expand CoNIFER’s functionality to off-target
data, we created pseudo-targets comprising the 104 gold
standard regions (extended by 50kb on either side). These
pseudo-targets were then broken down into pseudo-probes of
100 bp and 1000 bp to allow for higher resolution. The best re-
sults were obtained by using 1000 bp long pseudo-probes and
removing only the ﬁrst singular component. However,

CoNIFER’s performance falls far short of cnvOffSeq’s in
terms of sensitivity. CoNIFER detects only 12 of the gold stand-
ard calls (corresponding to a sensitivity of 7.6%), most of which
were genotyped as homozygous deletions by the 1000 Genomes
Project (Table 1). This highlights the highly stringent nature of
global SVD normalization, which renders it unsuitable for off-
target CNV detection.

while the red dashed lines denote the breakpoints of the deletions as determined by the 1000 Genomes Project

cnvOffSeq uses low-order singular component filtering to de-
noise a large portion of the off-target RD. To demonstrate why
low-order ﬁltering alone is not sufﬁcient for optimal results, we
also developed a variation of our normalization algorithm called
local static SVD. Like its adaptive counterpart, static SVD
segments the genome using patterns of RD, but then applies
low-order filtering to every segment. This approach achieves a
sensitivity of 49.4%, which is comparable with cnvOffSeq. As
expected, however, the non-adaptive normalization does not
cope well with segments dominated by systematic bias and is
therefore more prone to false positives (Fig. 2b). Thus static
SVD exhibits an elevated FDR of 17.8% compared to 5% for
adaptive SVD (Table 1).

We also investigated the genotyping performance of
cnvOffSeq as compared with caniTSeq and local static SVD.
CoNIFER was excluded from this comparison, as it doesn’t pro-
vide absolute copy numbers. All methods in this analysis gener-
ate posterior probabilities for each CNV call, which were used to
exclude results of low conﬁdence (designated as missing).
cnvOffSeq achieved an overall genotyping accuracy of 96.3%
versus 73.0% for caniTSeq and 90.8% for local static SVD
(Table 2). Furthermore cnvOffSeq and local static SVD exhibited

comparable missing rates, while caniTSeq’s was almost twice
as high signifying a higher proportion of low quality genotype
calls.

Finally, we set out to explore how our off-target results com-
pare to those obtained using whole-genome data. To that end,
we applied caniTSeq and CNVnator to low-coverage WGS
data (3x716x) for the same 50 samples. The higher and more
even coverage of the WGS dataset leads to higher overall sensi-
tivity (75.5% for caniTSeq and 62.6% for CNVnator versus
57.5% for cnvOffSeq). The improvement was more pronounced
in CNVs smaller than 3kb for which caniTSeq achieves a

sensitivity of 41.8% compared to 19.5% for cnvOffSeq. The
FDR does not appear to beneﬁt and remains comparable be-
tween WGS and off-target results (5.5% for caniTSeq and
11.1% for CNVnator versus 5% for cnvOffSeq).

3.3 Performance versus CNV length

The inherently irregular nature of off-target RD may pose limits
in the attainable resolution for CNV detection. Therefore, we
investigated cnvOffSeq’s performance as a function of the gold
standard CNV length, by only considering events larger than a
certain (variable) threshold. The results indicate that both the
sensitivity and the accuracy improve signiﬁcantly for longer
CNVs (Table 3).

Speciﬁcally, the sensitivity exceeds 90% for deletions above
5kb, while the speciﬁcity reaches 97%. False positives appear
to be evenly distributed across CNV lengths, as the FDR remains
consistent throughout. The performance deteriorates for lengths
higher than 25 kb, simply because there are only two deletions in
the gold standard that exceed this threshold. Thus, we conclude
that cnvOffSeq is especially well suited for longer deletions
(>5 kb) which are detected with very high sensitivity and consist-
ently low false discovery rate.

4 DISCUSSION

Exome sequencing is a relatively nascent technology that has
nevertheless achieved near ubiquity, particularly in the ﬁeld of
Mendelian genetics. Due to its cost— and time-effectiveness,
exome sequencing has largely superseded both WGS and more
traditional linkage studies for investigating rare genetic disorders.
Furthermore, exome sequencing has proven to be a powerful
diagnostic tool that has revolutionized clinical genetics. By elu-
cidating disorders of unknown genetic aetiology, exome

sequencing can inform custom treatment options, thus ushering
in a new era of truly personalized medicine.

Off-target data are an integral, but overlooked, component of
exome sequencing. Regardless of the underlying technology, en-
richment strategies attempt to strike a balance between on-target
stringency and coverage maximization. The fortunate side effect
of this delicate equilibrium is off-target reads, which are often
regarded as wasteful and dispensable. As exome sequencing is
maturing, it will continue to generate increasing amounts of off-
target data that represent an unexplored treasure of genomic
information. cnvOffSeq is the first method to tap into this valu-
able resource for the purpose of CNV detection.

Off-target enrichment arises through various processes leading
to highly heterogeneous off-target coverage. Off-target read
depth is affected by a mixture of deterministic biases and
random noise that require individualized treatment, but are dif-
ficult to determine a priori. As a result off-target data pose a
significant challenge for CNV detection that prompted the de-
velopment of a tailored data-driven normalization approach, im-
plemented in cnvOffSeq.

We have demonstrated that our local adaptive SVD approach
provides a ﬂexible and robust framework for off-target read
depth normalization that can enhance true signal while eliminat-
ing capture artifacts. cnvOffSeq clearly outperforms CNV detec-
tion methods that were designed for WGS. Furthermore, it was
shown to improve upon both high-order and low-order singular
component ﬁltering, thus amounting to more than the sum of its
parts.

cnvOffSeq was tested on data from both Agilent and
Nimblegen capture assays but remains platform-agnostic. Like
all SVD-based techniques, cnvOffSeq’s ability to mitigate sys-
tematic bias improves with larger sample sizes. However, even
in the absence of sufﬁciently large datasets, cnvOffSeq retains
some of its de-noising capacity by essentially reverting to low-
order singular component filtering. Finally, the modular nature
of our pipeline allows for the RD normalization to be separated
from the CNV calling and incorporated into future applications
as a pre-processing step.

5 CONCLUSION

cnvOffSeq offers a new perspective on exome sequencing analysis
and provides the tools for repurposing previously discarded sur-
plus into meaningful data. Given the abundance of exome data-
sets, cnvOffSeq constitutes a powerful, novel method for
investigating intergenic CNV and exploring its contribution to
disease and phenotypic variation.

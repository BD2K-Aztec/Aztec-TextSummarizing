algorithm in this article that exploits sample sparsity to reduce
the cost of sequencing without compromising the accuracy of
identiﬁcation of all distinct genomes, even the ones that are
minimally represented in the sample.

2 APPROACH

A na'ive approach to solve the problem, which we call single—cell
co—assembly strategy, is to amplify the genome of each cell,
barcode them individually, pool them, sequence in one sequen—
cing run and demultiplex based on the barcode. In this ap—
proach, each cell should be isolated and its DNA extracted
and ampliﬁed using MDA. Although there is currently no
high—throughput device to perform these processes, one could
envision automated microﬁuidic devices that will be capable of
high—throughput separation, DNA extraction, ampliﬁcation and
barcoding of single cells in the near future. The output sequen—
cing reads could then be co—assembled using our tool HyDA
(Movahedi et al., 2012). In HyDA, the read dataset of each
cell is assigned a unique color. All the colors are co—assembled
in one colored de Bruijn graph. This approach requires enough
unique barcodes to tag the fragments of each cell. Also, bar—
codes attached to each fragment are sequenced, which imposes
additional sequencing cost. Fabrication of so many unique bar—
codes becomes prohibitively expensive for a large number of
cells, and therefore this na'ive approach will not work.

The number of distinct genomes in a microbial community is
often much less than the number of cells. For example, Qin
et al. (2010) estimated the number of detected distinct species
in the human gut to be in the order of 1000, whereas the
number of microbial cells in a human body, most of which
reside in the gut, is in the order of 100 trillion. We call this
effect the sparsity of distinct genomes in a sizable microbial
population. The na'ive approach does not exploit the sparsity
to reduce the cost of sequencing. Here, we proposed to exploit
the spareness by adopting a divide and conquer strategy to
reduce the amount of required barcodes and sequencing.
After isolation of each cell and extraction of the DNA, every
DNA is ampliﬁed and stored separately, e.g. in a microﬂuidic
droplet. The main idea is to sample the ampliﬁed DNAs adap—
tively, which is essentially allocating sequencing and barcoding
resources dynamically over the course of multiple sensing iter—
ations. Initially, the algorithm has one group of cells, which is
the entire sample. In each iteration, each group is divided into
two equally sized subgroups. A small amount of DNA from
each cell in a subgroup is sampled, pooled and sequenced. In
practice, one barcode per subgroup is used to multiplex and
demultiplex the sequencing in one run. The amount of sampling
from each cell is computed based on the results of previous
iterations. This is called resource allocation and is similar to
the one proposed by Haupt et al. (2011) and Wei and Hero
(2012). The resulting read datasets, one per subgroup, are then
co—assembled and compared using HyDA to decide pairwise sub—
sumption of subgroups. The cells in those subgroups that are
subsumed by other subgroups, even in previous iterations, are
eliminated from further analysis. This procedure is continued
until each remaining group contains only one cell. The resulting
non—redundant single element groups capture all of the distinct
genome sequences.

3 METHODS

Although distinct genomes are often identiﬁed as different species, there
are numerous cases where distinct genomes are categorized as varied
instances of the same species or even the same strain. Instead of identi-
ﬁcation of strains and species that are currently phenotypic notions, the
goal of our approach is to ﬁnd all distinct genomes in a sample. We deﬁne
two genome sequences to be distinct if the ratio of their differences over
the whole genome size is above a threshold. That threshold is input by the
user and controls a trade-off between sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

Co-assembly and comparison of multiple input read datasets lie at the
core of both approaches we take in this article. Although there are as-
sembly tools for single-cell genomic data, such as SPAdes (Bankevich
et al., 2012) and IDBA—UD (Peng et al., 2012), and also co-assembly tools
for normal multicell genomic data such as Cortex (Iqbal et al., 2012), we
use HyDA, which is the only tool to date that has both functionalities
(Movahedi et al., 2012). However, the novel ideas proposed here can also
be implemented using other assemblers. For the sake of completeness,
HyDA algorithm is summarized in the following.

3.1 Co-assembly algorithm

3.1.] Construction and condensation of the colored de Bruijn
graph The colored de Bruijn graph, a variation of the standard de
Bruijn graph, is a combinatorial structure that can be used to assemble
a number of input read datasets, each represented by a color, superim-
posed on a single de Bruin graph (Iqbal et al., 2012). The output of such
assembly methods is a number of assembled sequences (contigs) and the
corresponding average multiplicity in each color. Our de Bruijn graph of
the input reads is stored in a hashed collection of splay trees whose
vertices are k-mers with an array of multiplicity counts (one entry per
color), in- and out-edges and internal ﬂags. A l-in l-out chain of k-mers
is condensed into an equivalent long sequence, which is called a unitig.
A maximal unitig, which cannot be extended further because of a branch
in the graph, is a contig. Note that in HyDA, our condensation is solely
based on the topology of the graph without any attention to the colored
multiplicities. Ignoring multiplicities for condensation is purposefully
done, and constitutes the feature that allows the assembler to deal with
black out regions in single-cell MDA (Chitsaz et al., 2011).

Contigs with low coverage are often caused by sequencing error. The
low-coverage contig removal process is iterated with an increased cutoff
in each round. In each iteration, those contigs whose maximum coverage
over all colors is less than the cutoff are eliminated, and the remaining
graph is recondensed. This causes some contigs to merge into larger ones
with recomputed average coverages. This process is similar to Velvet—
SC’s low-coverage contig removal, but instead of considering one average
coverage per contig, HyDA considers the maximum of average coverages
for all the colors of each contig (Chitsaz et al., 2011). In this case, only
those contigs that have low coverage in all colors are considered errone-
ous and removed. Another possible approach is to eliminate those contigs
for which the mean of average coverages for all colors is less than the
cutoff. However, if we were to follow this approach, a contig that is well
covered in one color but is poorly covered or absent in hundreds of colors
would be lost, as the mean would dilute the effect of coverage in one color
among hundreds of colors. This approach would not work for us here
because our goal is to be able to preserve rare contigs.

3.1.2 Redundancy removal To remove redundant genomes, we
deﬁne a relation that is reminiscent of subset relation on the set of contigs
for each color. Note that our goal here is to remove redundant genomes,
which are collections of contigs, rather than to remove individually
redundant contigs. Let A = {a}, a2, . . . ,ar} be the set of remaining
contigs after iterative error removal. Let All-(L1,) denote the average cover-
age of contig a,- in color j, for 1 5 i 5 r and 1 5 j 5 s, where s is the
number of colors. Pick 6 z 0, and let Aj = {ai e A | Alj(ai)>e} C A be

off between specificity and sensitivity. We chose 6 : 0 in this study. but a
non—zero 6 might be needed if there are erroneous or contaminant lc—mers
in one color that also occur in the true genomic sequence of another

color.
We define D,(A,. A,-) e [R on the set f : {A}. A3. .... A,} as:

including sequencing errors. intrastrain variations such as single nucleo—
tide polymorphisms and indels. contaminations added in the amplifica—
tion and sequencing process and lack ofcoverage in some regions caused
by the MDA. Hence. the definition of subset should be loosened by
choosing a small but non—zero value for I. Beside e. the value of I
gives a trade—off between specificity and sensitivity of recognizing distinct
genomes. If I is small. the algorithm detects two equivalent genomes as
distinct. and if I is large. distinct genomes are declared equivalent. To see
how I is chosen. refer to Sections 3.2 and 4.2. The results are shown in
Table 3. Finally. we compute a non—redundant set of assemblies 5 : {A,I .

3.2 Divide and conquer strategy exploiting sparsity

Let n be the number of cells in the sample. and denote the cells by
S‘.i : l. ....n. Our algorithm aims to assemble all of the distinct gen—
omes and identify at least one cell per distinct genome. To reach this goal.
our algorithm iteratively pools samples of amplicons from different cells.
tags each pool with a unique barcode. mixes the barcoded pools and has
the result sequenced. The objective is to minimize the total number
of bases required to be sequenced as well as the number of different
barcodes needed.
In the first iteration. we divide the 12 cells 5'.  S” into two sets

11.1 : is“. Hush/21},

1,.2 : {.S‘Wl“. 

Our algorithm samples equal amount of amplicons from each cell in 1H
and 1,3. The amplicons in each set are pooled and tagged by two distinct
barcodes. The barcoded amplicons are sequenced to reach a desired
number of base pairs. This number is an input parameter of our algo—
rithm. We define the total number of base pairs sequenced from 1],, to be
l7], for i : l. 2. The two read datasets are co—assembled by HyDA using
two colors. The result is two sets ofcontigs for each color. A]_] and A13.
We calculate D,,(A],].A],3) and D,,(A],3.AH) as defined in (l). in
which I] : I/HIHX/ ll]_,-l. I is an input parameter and l - l is the set car—
dinality. We choose I to be the maximum allowable difference between
the assembly of two single cells from the same strain. Based on these
values. we decide whether the relations AHjnAm and AlgjnAH
hold. If A]_] is a subset of Am. then all of the distinct genomes in [L]
are present in 11.3: therefore. the cells in 1].] do not need further sampling.
This applies to 11.3 too. if AL; is a subset of A]. 1. If both relations hold.
one of IL] or 11.3 is eliminated arbitrarily from further analysis. Each
remaining set 1].. is divided into two subsets for analysis in the second
iteration. Figure 1 depicts an example of 10 cells with 3 distinct genomes
shown in different colors.

Another factor that affects accuracy of the assessment of these rela—
tions is the choice of I,. The threshold I, in the i‘“ iteration is used to
detect cells with similar genomes despite small differences in their assem—

worst possible case, it is assumed that there are |I,;j| distinct genomes in
each group I”. Therefore, max] 51-5,", |I,;j| captures the maximum
number of distinct genomes in 1,;1- from any I“. With these assumptions,
I,» is a conservative threshold. This threshold will guarantee that two
distinct genomes are detected, but it has the possibility of detecting simi-
lar genomes as distinct. In the last iteration of the algorithm, when every
group consists of one cell, the threshold is I. Note that the number of
iterations, which is the number of sequencing rounds, is always [log2 n].

3.3 Implementation
We implemented our algorithm in a tool called Squeezambler l . O in

C++. Our tool and datasets are available at http://compbio.cs.wayne.
edu/software/squeezambler/ .

4 RESULTS

Because we did not have access to real data, we tested our algo—
rithm using simulated data. We used our tool MDAsim 1.0
(Taghavi and Draghici, 2012) to simulate 100 MDA processes
(one process per cell) from 9 distinct genomes. The output
of MDAsim 1.0 was fed into an Illumina read generator,
ART (Huang et al., 2012), to generate Illumina reads, with real—
istic errors, from the simulated amplicons. The set of generated
reads for each cell was treated like a microﬁuidic droplet from
which samples without replacement are extracted in each
iteration of Squeezambler l . 0. We assume that MDA prod—
ucts are contamination—free, which require a contaminant—free
automated microﬁuidic cell sorting, amplification and sampling
device.

4.1 Datasets

A total of 115 MDAs were simulated from nine distinct genomes
chosen from the list of species found in a gut metagenomics
study (Qin et al., 2010) that have a complete or draft reference
genome. Recall that we are simulating MDA from a reference

the diverse nature of MDA coverage bias. ART, an Illumina read
generator, was then deployed to generate 100 bp Illumina reads
from the simulated amplicons. The ampliﬁcation gain of
MDAsim 1.0 was 300>< and that of ART was 8>< from which
one—eighth were selected randomly to obtain a total gain of
300x. We assembled the dataset of each cell individually with
HyDA 1.0, and the resulting assemblies have between 0.1 and
4.2% missing reference bases measured by Gage (Salzberg et al.,
2012), which is similar to the real world situation with a success—
ful MDA reaction (Chitsaz et al., 2011). We made an error pro—
file that matches the error statistics of Illumina HiSeq 2000 for
ART. Using our proﬁle, ART injects on average 1% error into the
reads, because of which we need to eliminate erroneous contigs in
the assembler. HyDA l . O, and also its predecessor Velvet—SC,
has an iterative algorithm to remove low—coverage contigs, which
is explained in Section 3.1.1. In each iteration, Squeezambler
l . 0 provides HyDA l . O with a coverage cutoff as a percentage
of the mean coverage of each color. That percentage is constant
in all iterations.

We designed three collections of cells, the statistics of which are
summarized in Table 2. In the first collection, there are 62 cells
with 6 distinct genomes. In this collection, we put 22 different
MDA results from NC_004663.1 and 22 from FP929051.1 to

play the role of highly abundant genomes in a sample as well as
1 from NC_016776.1 and 2 from NC_008532.1 to represent
low—abundance genomes in the same sample. In the first collec—
tion, the number of distinct genomes is approximately one—tenth
of the number of cells, but with a wide range of abundances. The
second collection is the sparsest collection among the three, where
the number of distinct genomes is approximately one—twentieth of
the number of cells. The third collection is the most diverse of the
three, where the number of distinct genomes is approximately
one—sixteenth of the number of cells.

4.2 Simulation results

We ran Squeezambler l . O for the three collections described
above, the results of which are summarized in Table 3. Most of
the Squeezambler l . 0 parameters were the same for all three
collections. The assembly inclusion threshold constant per cell
was chosen I = 0.2, which means at most 20% of the assembly
can vary among multiple instances of the same genome. Taking
into account the genomic sequence loss caused by the MDA,
sampling of the amplicons and sequencing errors, 20% is a rea—
sonable choice. This is not an optimized value and is chosen
based on the authors’ intuition. We chose I conservatively in
this work so that distinct genomes are not lost but some equiva—
lent genomes are detected as distinct. Finding the optimal value
for I needs a thorough study, which is beyond the scope of this
article.

The k—mer size for HyDA l . O was chosen to be k = 55, which
is a common choice for the chosen Illumina error proﬁle (Chitsaz
et al., 2011). The coverage cutoff, as a percentage of the coverage
mean, was chosen to be 100%, and the minimum contig length
was 100 bp for HyDA l . O. The coverage mean is estimated based
on the assembly size in the ﬁrst iteration, which is often larger
than the actual genome size because of a myriad of erroneous
low coverage k—mers. This causes the initially estimated coverage
mean to be a small fraction of the ﬁnal coverage mean after error
removal.

Squeezambler l . O has an option to choose the number of
initial groups in the ﬁrst iteration, g. If g is chosen to be equal

to the number of cells, then Squeezambler 1.0 simulates
the single—cell co—assembly of all the cells. If g = 2, then
Squeezambler 1.0 simulates the divide and conquer
algorithm described in Section 3.2. Although experimenting
with different g values may improve the results, we do not
have data for it.

Before any sequencing is done, the algorithm has no idea
about the genome sizes, various distinct genomes and abundance
of each genome. Therefore, an unbiased algorithm has to se—
quence from each cell exactly the same amount right in the
ﬁrst iteration. That amount in our algorithm, denoted by
bLj/llwl, iS an input parameter to Squeezambler 1.0,
which was chosen to be between 1 Mbp and 63 Mbp as reported
in the third column of Table 3. In our setup, the size of the nine
distinct genomes varies between 1.8 and 6.3 Mbp; see Table 1.
Therefore, lep sequencing provides between 1/6>< and 1/2><
coverage, and 63 Mbp sequencing provides between 10>< and
35x coverage.

The input parameter c, which controls the amount of sequen—
cing in subsequent rounds, was chosen to be c: 10, which
means 10>< expected coverage from each genome in each collec—
tion. We observed that in practice 10>< coverage of each distinct
genome provides sufﬁcient information for reliable evaluation of
f. This is consistent with the Lander and Waterman (1988) ana—
lysis, in which the statistics of gaps and contigs in terms of cover—
age is characterized. Based on that analysis, 10>< coverage yields
the entire genome without gap with high probability.

Our divide and conquer algorithm exhibits significant im—
provement in maximum barcodes, and in most cases the total
number of base pairs sequenced, over the single—cell co—assembly
method. For the 97 cells, 5 distinct genomes collection, our
divide and conquer algorithm requires only 2.9 Gbp sequencing
and 10 barcodes in comparison with 3.0 Gbp sequencing and
97 barcodes consumed by the single—cell co—assembly method.
Similarly for the 62 cells, 6 distinct genomes collection, our
divide and conquer algorithm requires only 3.0 Gbp sequencing
and 10 barcodes in comparison with 3.9 Gbp sequencing and
62 barcodes required by the single—cell co—assembly method.

Even though for the 112 cells, 7 distinct genomes collection, our
divide and conquer algorithm outperforms single—cell co—assem—
bly in terms of the number of barcodes, by 33 versus 112, it
requires 7.1Gbp sequencing, which is more than that used by
single—cell co—assembly (3.5 Gbp).

In all of our experiments, all distinct genomes were correctly
detected. Therefore, our results exhibit ultimate sensitivity.
However, in some experiments, multiple cells with similar
genomes were identiﬁed as distinct, which is not an issue for
our problem, because, based on the results of Squeezambler
l . 0, those cells that are identified as with distinct genomes can
be deeply sequenced and assembled afterward. For the 62 cells, 6
distinct genomes collection, the number of detected distinct gen—
omes was between 6 and 8. For the 97 cells, 5 distinct genomes
collection, that number was between 5 and 11, and for the 112
cells, 7 distinct genomes collection, that was between 7 and 14.
This specificity is reported in the sixth column of Table 3. Note
that the number of sequencing rounds (iterations) for single—cell
co—assembly is always 1, and for divide and conquer with g = 2,
it is |rlog2 

Owing to the computational intensity of MDAsim l .0, HyDA
1.0 and Squeezambler 1.0, we report our results for only
small examples to provide a proof of concept. We also chose
our parameters conservatively, and without optimization, so
that we do not compromise accuracy. Moreover, our examples
are in the order of 100 cells and 6 distinct genomes, whereas
real world samples are much sparser, as the number of cells
may be in the order of billions and the number of distinct gen—
omes at most in the order of thousands. Therefore, we expect the
reduction in the total sequencing and maximum barcodes to be
higher for real world applications than what we report in this
article.

5 CONCLUSION

We presented an adaptive divide and conquer algorithm for dis—
tilled sequencing and de novo assembly of distinct genomes in a
bacterial community, e.g. human gut microbiome. Samples
derived from such communities are often sparse in the sense
that the number of distinct genomes is much less than the
number of cells. Our algorithm exploits sparsity to decrease the
amount of sequencing and the number of multiplexing barcodes
needed for single—cell sequencing and de novo assembly.

We implemented our algorithm in a tool which we call
Squeezambler and performed simulation experiments to dem—
onstrate its power. Our results show that (i) the number of
required barcodes with our divide and conquer algorithm is
less than that required by the naive approach, and that (ii) the
amount of sequencing needed remains the same or decreases.
Owing to the computational intensity of the problem, only
small examples with low sparsity were studied in this work.
Real—world samples are much sparser (~1000 species in ~10”
cells) than the examples here (~5 species in ~100 cells). Also, the
parameters used to run our tool were chosen conservatively and
without optimization. Therefore, we expect the improvement of
our algorithm to be higher than what we reported in this article
in real—world situations. Squeezambler 1.0 identiﬁes all dis—
tinct genomes in the sample, which are candidates for different
strains/species. Those cells that are identified as having distinct

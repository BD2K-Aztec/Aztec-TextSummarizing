Abstract

Motivation: Glycans play critical roles in many biological processes, and their structural diversity
is key for specific protein—glycan recognition. Comparative structural studies of biological mol—
ecules provide useful insight into their biological relationships. However, most computational tools
are designed for protein structure, and despite their importance, there is no currently available tool
for comparing glycan structures in a sequence order— and size—independent manner.

Results: A novel method, GS—align, is developed for glycan structure alignment and similarity meas—
urement. GS—align generates possible alignments between two glycan structures through iterative
maximum clique search and fragment superposition. The optimal alignment is then determined by
the maximum structural similarity score, GS—score, which is size—independent. Benchmark tests
against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) N—linked glycan library and PDB homologous/non—homologous
N—glycoprotein sets indicate that GS—align is a robust computational tool to align glycan structures
and quantify their structural similarity. GS—align is also applied to template—based glycan structure
prediction and monosaccharide substitution matrix generation to illustrate its utility.

1 Introduction

 

Glycans are one of the four fundamental components of cells (along
with nucleic acids, proteins and lipids) and the most abundant and di—
verse biopolymers in nature (Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006). They are
not only conjugated to proteins (glycoproteins) or lipids (glycolipids),
but also exist as diffusible ligands (Cummings, 2009; Dwek, 1996;
Varki et (11., 2009). Protein glycosylation is one of the most important
post—translational modifications, with more than half of all proteins
expected to be glycosylated (preiler et (11., 1999). Protein glycosyla—
tion falls into two general categories, N- and O—linked glycosylation.
N—glycosylation links glycans to Asn residues in the sequon,

Asn—X—Thr/Ser (where X can be any amino acid except Pro), of a nas—
cent polypeptide (N—glycans) (Imperiali and Hendrickson, 1995),
Whereas O—linked glycosylation attaches glycans to Ser and Thr
residues at sites which do not have a well—defined sequence motif
(O—glycans) (Van den Steen et (11., 1998). In particular, N—
glycosylation is needed for proper folding of a protein as well as qual—
ity control in the endoplasmic reticulum (Rudd et (11., 2001). Based
on the lipid type, glycolipids can be classified into three main groups:
glycoglycerolipids, glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI) and glyco—
sphingolipids (Cummings, 2009). Hyaluronic acid is one of glycan

(diffusible) ligands, which is not linked to either proteins or lipids
and is secreted into extracellular compartments (Weigel et (11., 1997).

Glycans play critical roles in many biological processes through
covalent addition and/or specific protein—glycan recognition events.
For example, they interact with diverse proteins and are involved in
cell growth and development, tumor growth and metastasis, anticoa—
gulation, inﬂammation, immune tolerance, intercellular adhesion,
cell—cell communication and microbial attachment (Baenziger, 1985;
Casu et (11., 2004; Imberty and Varrot, 2008; Rabinovich and
Toscano, 2009; Rudd et (11., 2004). Glycans come in a diversity of se—
quences and structures by linking individual sugar units in a multitude
of ways. They can be broadly classified as linear and branched sugars
in terms of their sequence, and both forms are present in
glycoconjugates (Lowe and Marth, 2003; Varki et (11., 2009).
The majority of the linear sugars are glycosaminoglycans and hyalur—
onic acid (Raman et (11., 2005 ). Due to their ﬂexible glycosidic link—
ages, glycans have an ensemble of diverse conformations (Petrescu
et (11., 1997; Woods et (11., 1998), and such a structural diversity is es—
sential for specific binding to their receptor proteins. For example, the
pentasaccharide of ganglioside GM1 has different conformations
upon binding to galectin—1 and cholera toxin (Siebert et (11., 2003).

In contemporary structural biology, the comparison and align—
ment of protein structures are widely employed in studies such as
hierarchical classification of the known structural space of protein
domains (Andreeva et (11., 2004; Greene et (11., 2007), inference of
protein function from structure (Godzik et (11., 2007) and protein
structure modeling (Moult et (11., 2003). Protein structure compari—
son and alignment is a well—established area and there are currently
many publicly available tools such as DALI (Holm and Sander,
1996), CE (Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998) and TM—align (Zhang
and Skolnick, 2005).

The mammalian glycome encompasses a diverse and abundant rep—
ertoire of glycan structures, and could be larger than the proteome
(Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006). Because of their significant roles in biol—
ogy, understanding glycan structure and function in the context of their
3D structure is central to understanding biology. Despite the difficulties
in crystallization, the rate of deposition of glycan—containing structures
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et (11., 2002) has been steadily
increasing (Jo at 111., 2011). As demonstrated in protein structural biol—
ogy, fast and accurate computational tools for comparison and align—
ment of glycan structures are crucial to take an integrated approach to
advance glycan structure—function relationships. However, developing
a glycan structure alignment tool is challenging, given the unique struc—
tural features of glycans through different linkages and branching, re—
sulting in a tree—like structure unlike proteins. To the best of our
knowledge, there have been no such tools published to date.

To make a progress in the structural glycobiology field, we intro—
duce a novel method, GS—align, for glycan structure alignment and
similarity measurement. In particular, GS—align provides a size—
independent structural similarity score, GS—score. Below, we first
describe the alignment and scoring algorithms in details. Benchmark
tests and representative examples are then presented to illustrate
reliability and applicability of GS—align. Finally, we discuss both the
advantages and limitations of our approach.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Preparation of random glycan structures

To prepare a set of random glycan structures, biologically relevant
glycan sequences that are largely different from each other were
chosen from the KEGG GLYCAN database, a collection of

experimentally determined glycan sequences (http://www.genome.
jp/kegg/glycan) (Hashimoto et (11., 2006). Using all the glycan se—
quence information in KCF (KEGG Chemical Function) format,
carbohydrate (residue) names and linkage information between resi—
dues were extracted from the NODE and EDGE sections of each
KCF file. Any glycan structures that contain ambiguous linkage in—
formation were discarded. The total number of the remaining glycan
sequences was 10 983, and the glycan length (i.e. the total number
of carbohydrate residues) ranged from 1 to 54 (as of May, 2014)
(Supplementary Fig. S1A).

The CHARMM biomolecular simulation program (Brooks
et (11., 2009) was used to generate initial 3D glycan structures from
the sequence obtained from the KEGG GLYCAN database. Glycans
containing sugars whose topologies are not available in the
CHARMM carbohydrate force field (Guvench et (11., 2008) were
discarded for this study. To account for only non—redundant
(unique) glycan sequences, all files in KCF format were converted
into string format data structures for easy comparison of different
glycan sequences by each sugar position, glycosidic linkage carbon
number and anomeric configuration. Redundant sequences were
removed, and the final CHARMM—compatible unique KEGG glycan
sequences (4907 entries) were obtained after excluding glycans
containing furanose monosaccharides (58 out of 4965), as the
current version of GS—align is not able to handle five—membered
rings. Supplementary Figure S1B shows the numbers of final unique
KEGG glycans in terms of glycan length.

To prepare non—homologous glycans for a given glycan length,
called a ‘random glycan structure set’, a glycan sequence similarity
score matrix was first obtained by an in—house glycan sequence
alignment tool, which adopts tree—matching methods for glycan
sequence similarity measurement (Aoki et (11., 2003). Then, all the
glycans were clustered using the average linkage clustering method
with a sequence similarity score cutoff of 0, which is the median of
all possible scores. Seventy clusters were identified for glycan lengths
ranging from 4 to 12, which were determined based on the abun—
dance and the structural diversity in the unique KEGG glycans, and
their centroids were used as glycan sequences for the random glycan
structure set. For each of the 70 glycans, 10 conformations were
generated by randomly changing possible glycosidic dihedral angles
(by 30° interval) using the IC EDIT and IC BUILD commands in
CHARMM. If the newly generated random conformation had a
CHARMM van der Waals energy <100kcal/mol, the conformation
was accepted. Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the number of
glycan structures as a function of glycan length in the random glycan
structure set.

2.2 Glycan structure alignment
In GS—align, all possible alignments between two glycan structures
are generated by iterative maximum clique search and fragment
superposition, and the optimal alignment is determined by the max—
imum GS—score (see the next subsection for its definition). The over—
all algorithm is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. In the
maximum clique search method, two given glycan structures
(A and B) are represented by ring centroids and glycosidic oxygen
atoms (RIA) : {r§A),r(2A), . . . 4(a)} and R(B) : {r§B),r(2B), . . W143},
where 1' is the coordinate of ring centroid or glycosidic
oxygen). All combinations of inter—structural pairs (PAB :
{P11(YIAIv[IBILPHUIAIJIBIL - - - 7PMN(YI(/IIJI~I$))}I are generated
using the representative points from the glycan structures.

Two pairs pii(ri(A),r]~(B)) and pk1(r1({A),r)B)) are selected from PAB
and then both distances d(r(A),r1({A)) and d(r]~(B),r)B)) are calculated.

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the alignment algorithm in GS-align

If Id(ri(A),rl({A)) — d(r].(B),r)B))I is less than a cutoff (dcut), pii and pkl are
assigned to vertices of a product graph and connected by an edge.
This procedure is applied to all pairs in PAB. The generated product
graph is searched for the maximum clique, the largest subset of verti—
ces in which all vertices are connected to all other vertices. In our
case, solving the maximum clique problem for the product graph is
equivalent to identification of the largest subset of structurally aligned
points. We used an improved branch and bound algorithm for fast
maximum clique search (Konc and Janezic, 2007; Lee and Im, 2012).
Two glycan structures are superposed using the rotation matrix ob—
tained from the aligned point sets. GS—align repeats this procedure
five times, increasing dcut from 1 to 3.0A by an increment of 0.5A
(so—called the iterative maximum clique search). Thus, five alignments
are generated.

The second method to align two glycan structures is to use frag—
ments from each glycan. A set of consecutively linked residues is
extracted from each glycan. Both linear (three residues) and branched
(four residues) fragments are considered and for branched fragments,
additional fragments are generated by swapping l and [2 residues in
Figure 1. For each fragment pair from two glycans, an initial align—
ment is obtained using equivalent residue pairs in the fragment pair. A
set of optimal alignment residue pairs is identified based on the initial
alignment. If the ring centroid distance between an aligned residue
pair is > 8A, the pair is discarded from the aligned residue pair set.
GS—align then again superposes the glycan structures by the rotation
matrix for the updated aligned residue pairs. This procedure generates
additional alignments for all combinations of fragment pairs. Indeed,
a strong complementary nature was found between the iterative max—
imum clique search and the fragment superposition; for example,
when all random glycan structure pairs were aligned, 41% of the opti—
mal alignments with the maximum GS—score were from the former
and 59% from the later.

2.3 Glycan structure similarity measurement
GS—score is a scoring function to quantify structure similarity
between two glycan structures:

pairs as a function of glycan length

where ‘Max’ denotes that the GS—score is the maximum of all possible
alignments, NOG+Ring22LTarget— 1 is the total number of oxygen
atoms in the glycosidic linkages (0G) and sugar rings of a target gly—
can, LT“get is the length of the target glycan, and Neg,“ and NRinWli
are the numbers of glycosidic oxygen atoms and sugar rings in the
aligned residues, respectively. The aligned residue pairs (i.e. which
residue of glycan A is structurally aligned onto which residue of gly—
can B in a given alignment generated from the iterative maximum cli—
que search and fragment superposition) are identified using the
shortest augmenting path algorithm to solve the linear sum assign—
ment problem (LSAP) (Derigs, 1985; Gao and Skolnick, 2013). dog,-
is the distance between the glycosidic oxygen atoms in the ith pair of
aligned residues and dRingJ is the root—mean—square deviation (RMSD)
between the sugar ring atoms (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and O5) in the ith
pair of aligned residues (Supplementary Fig. S2). docp and dRingp are
the scaling factors to normalize the aligned distances. A final align—
ment is selected by the maximum GS—score alignment.

Figure 2 shows the average GS—scores calculated from all pairs of
700 random glycan structures (Supplementary Table S1) as a func—
tion of glycan length. The raw GS—score (rGS—score) is calculated
using a constant value (3 A) for docp and dRingp, based on the aver—
age distance between the centroids of adjacent sugar rings (3.26 A).
For the GS—score, glycan length—dependent scaling factors
dOG,0(L—rarget) and dRing,0(L—rarget) are used instead of the constant
value, so that the average GS—score is not dependent on the glycan
length for the random structure pairs. The scaling factors were
empirically obtained from curve fitting to the plots of the average
doc and dRing between an aligned residue pair as a function of
LT“get (Supplementary Fig. S3), where LT“get is the length of the
larger glycan in a glycan structure pair. The dOG,0(L—rarget) and
dRing,0(LTargetI are

dOG,O(LTarget) : 136V LTarget _ 2 _  
dRing,O (LTarget) :  V LTarget _ 2 _  

As shown in Figure 2, the mean GS—scores, normalized by the
glycan length—dependent docp and dRingp, are almost length—
independent for the random glycan structures, but the rGS—score
decreases from 0.65 to 0.35 as the glycan length increases. The aver—
age GS—score value for a random glycan structure pair is 0.44. Table
1 shows the statistical significance of the GS—score derived from the
random glycan structures with diverse sequences and conform—
ations. The GS—score distribution for all random glycans (of differ—
ent sequences, lengths and conformations) was modeled by the
normal distribution (Supplementary Fig. S4), and the P—values of
representative GS—scores are given in Table 1. A GS—score of 0.69 is
significant at P < 1 X 1073.

2.4 Preparation of N—glycan library

We downloaded the PDB files of X—ray crystallographic structures
containing at least one protein chain whose resolution is <3
Glycan Reader (Jo et al., 2011) was used for identification of protein
chains that include covalently linked glycans. These protein chains
were subsequently divided into N— and O—linked glycoproteins. The
coordinates and residue names of the N—glycans were individually
extracted from the glycan—containing PDB files (6320 PDB files, as of
July, 2014) using Glycan Reader. The protein coordinates of the
N—linked glycoproteins were also separately prepared from the PDB
files. The total number of N—glycans in the library was 14 414
because multiple glycans can be attached to one protein chain.

3 Results

3.1 Glycan structure alignment by GS—align

Figure 3 shows four representative examples to illustrate the align—
ment quality provided by GS—align. The representative alignments
were obtained from PDB N—glycan library search by GS—align. For
this search, a glycan structure consisting of 10 sugar residues in
PDB:1L6X was used as the query (target) structure; the target and
library glycans are colored in green and blue, respectively. The four
representative alignment pairs were chosen to have the same cover—
age of 0.9 and various GS—scores. The coverage is defined as a ratio
of aligned residues to the total number of residues in the target struc—
ture. If the distance between the centroids of sugar rings is within
5A, the library sugar residue is assigned as the aligned residue.

plot represent individual 35 glycan sequences and thick solid lines the aver-
age over all glycan sequences

Visual inspection of the four examples shows a clear correlation
between GS—score and structural similarity. To measure the struc—
tural similarity quantitatively, we calculated the RMSD for the
aligned residues. The calculated RMSDs are 0.46, 1.29, 2.05 and
2.67A for the corresponding GS—scores of 0.88, 0.81, 0.68 and
0.58, respectively.

3.2 Benchmark: homologous and non—homologous
N—glycoprotein sets

Recently, )0 et al. measured pairwise glycan structure similarity
using the RMSD among N—glycan structures having the identical
sequence (35 N—glycan sequences) (Jo et al., 2013). The N—glycan
structures in homologous glycoproteins are found to be significantly
conserved compared to those in non—homologous glycoproteins
through a P—value analysis using a random glycan conformation
background. An N—glycan structure pair is called ‘homologous’ or
‘non—homologous’ depending on the sequence similarity (with a
30% cutoff) and glycosylation sites between the parent proteins.
An analysis of the cumulative fractions of homologous and non—
homologous glycans structure pairs as a function of their P—value
showed that ~67% of the homologous N—glycan structure pairs
have a statistically significant level (P < 0.05) of structural similar—
ity, whereas ~36% of non—homologous N—glycan structure pairs
have the statistically equivalent level of structural similarity
(Jo et al., 2013).

We performed the same analysis using GS—align against the same
homologous and non—homologous sets. The only difference is that
GS—align is used for structure alignment and similarity measurement,
instead of the RMSD and P—value measurement (using the random
glycan conformations). Figure 4 shows a cumulative fraction of
glycan structure similarity as a function of GS—score for the homolo—
gous and non—homologous N—glycan structure pairs. The cumulative
percentage of non—homologous glycans is 38% at the GS—score for
which the cumulative percentage of homologous N—glycans is 67%,
showing good agreement with the previous results, as well as a clear
ability of GS—align to discriminate glycans of different conform—
ations. The GS—score (0.87) that gives these cumulative percentages
does not match the GS—score (0.57 in Table 1) at a P—value of 0.05
(used by )0 et al.) due to the different characteristics of the random
structure sets and scoring functions used in both analyses. It should
be noted that the cumulative percentages from the two sets at a
GS—score of 0.69 (P< 1 X 1073 in Table 1) are similar, indicating
that the N—glycan structures in both sets are not very significantly
different, although highly similar N—glycan pairs are observed more
in the homologous set.

3.3 Benchmark: PDB N—glycoprotein search

Figure 5A shows a comparison between glycan similarity and glyco—
protein similarity from a PDB N—glycan library search using a target
glycan and its parent protein (PDB:1L6X_A). We used TM—align
(Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) to measure the protein global structural
similarity which is quantified by TM—score. Above a GS—score of
0.69 (P—value < 1 X 10 T 3, a green dotted line in the figure), most of
the corresponding parent protein pairs show high structural similar—
ity in their global fold (TM—score > 0.86). This indicates that glycans
tend to have significant structural similarity when their parent
proteins are structurally homologous, supporting the previous study
of Jo et al. (2013). However, there are exceptional cases. Figure 5B
shows an example in which proteins show low structural similarity
(0.27 for entire proteins and 0.38 only for the glycan—bound
domains), but their glycans have relatively high structural similarity
with a GS—score of 0.72. This example demonstrates that a similar
glycan structure can also be detected from a protein with different
topology and function (1L6X_A: human immunoglobulin y—1 chain
C region and 1PPE_E: human leukocyte elastase). Figure 5C is an
example in which proteins show a high TM—score (0.98), but their
glycans have relatively low structural similarity with a GS—score of
0.59, demonstrating that glycan structures could be diverse, even
though their parent protein structures are almost identical. In
addition, it should be noted that most of the low GS—score cases
with relatively high TM—scores of more than 0.7 in Figure 5 result
from a mismatch in glycan lengths because the GS—scores in the plot
were normalized by larger glycan structures among each pair.
Supplementary Figure S5 shows the distribution plot of the
GS—scores normalized by smaller glycan structures, indicating that
smaller glycan fragments generally show high similarity to the
fragments of the target glycan and thus a fragment assembly
method would be promising in template—based glycan structure
modeling.

3.4 Illustration for template—based glycan structure
prediction

The procedure of comparative protein structure modeling usually
consists of two main steps: (i) identifying templates (from the PDB)

Fig. 6. An example of template-based glycan structure prediction. (A) Three
fragment structures from 1L6X7A glycan, each of which has four residues
(stick representation in green), that were individually used as the query struc-
ture to search for templates in the PDB library. Three best template glycans
(line representation in blue) were identified based on GS-score for each query
structure. (B) Structure similarity between the target glycan and a structure
assembled using the three-fragment templates in (A). (C) Structural similarity
between the target glycan (entire 1L6X7A glycan) and its best template

to the target sequence and (ii) building a full—length model using the
templates. Like protein structure prediction, this approach could be
a promising means of predicting glycan structures (Jo et al., 2013).
Figure 6 shows a representative example to illustrate a potential
application of GS—align to template—based glycan structure predic—
tion. In this case, 1L6X_A glycan was fragmented into three partial
structures, each of which has four residues (stick representation in
green in Fig. 6A). Each glycan fragment was then used as the query
structure to search for templates in the PDB N—glycan library. To
put strict conditions on the library search, we excluded glycans
whose parent proteins have a sequence identity >30% to 1L6X_A.
In these searches, GS—score was normalized by the length of the frag—
ment glycan, rather than those of larger template glycans, thereby
aiming at detecting all template glycans containing similar structures
to the query. Figure 6A shows the best template structures (line rep—
resentation in blue) superposed onto the query fragment glycans.
When a glycan structure was assembled from the three templates,
the modeled structure is quite similar to the target glycan with a
GS—score of 0.94 (Fig. 6B).

Alternatively, one can use the entire 1L6X_A glycan to search
for templates in the PDB N—glycan library. Structural similarity be—
tween the target glycan and its best template identified based on GS—
score (normalized by larger glycan) shows a high GS—score of 0.91
(Fig. 6C). The TM—score between the parent proteins of the target
glycan and the best template is 0.25. In this case, a PDB library
glycan that maximally covers the target glycan can be a good
template even when their parent proteins’ structures are different, as
illustrated in Figure 5B.

In a practical situation in which one needs to predict a glycan
structure from its sequence, a set of PDB template glycans could first
be searched based on the sequence similarity to the target glycan
and then adequate template structures could be identified after clus—
tering all the templates. Although further intricate computational
procedures would be needed to reliably generate a final glycan

Fig. 7. An example using GS-align for deriving a monosaccharide substitution
matrix. (A) A representative example where two different glycans have simi-
lar structure (GS-score:0.90) but different sequences. GlcNAc: N-acetyl-o—
glucosamin, Man: o—mannose, Lyx: o-lyxose. Two unmatched residues
(Man versus Lyx) are marked with red asterisks. (B) The percentages of other
monosaccharides that can substitute oc-o-Mannose in highly similar
glycan structure pairs (GS-score20.8). For comparison, the percentage of
oc-o-mannose itself is also included in the table

model, availability of good templates is a key factor to determine
the quality of the predicted model. This example demonstrates that
a set of substructures can be separately identified and assembled
into full glycan structures for glycan structure modeling.

3.5 Illustration for developing monosaccharide
substitution matrix
In protein bioinformatics, a substitution matrix such as PAM
(Dayhoff et al., 1983) and BLOSUM (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992)
is used for sequence alignment. Proper usage of such a substitution
matrix can significantly improve the quality of alignments, provid—
ing more biological insights into protein evolution, structure and
function. Similarly, incorporation of information on monosacchar—
ide substitution in conserved glycan structures into glycan sequence
alignment could provide biologically more reliable alignment
results.

Figure 7 illustrates a potential application of GS—align to deriving
a monosaccharide substitution matrix. Figure 7A shows a represen—
tative example in which two different glycans (3SIO_E in green and
1CPO_A in blue) have very similar structure (GS—score : 0.90) but
different monosaccharides (or—D—mannose versus or—D—lyxose) at two
positions. As a separate example, Figure 7B shows the percentages
of other monosaccharides that can substitute or—D—mannose as highly
similar glycan structure pairs (GS—score 2 0.8); the percentage is
calculated using all PDB N—glycans. For comparison, the percentage
of or—D—mannose itself is also included in the table. A monosaccharide
was assigned to the substituting monosaccharide if the RMSD
between the sugar rings is $2  in the aligned structures.

4 Discussion and conclusion

A comparative study of biological entities is a useful approach to get
valuable insight into their biological relationships. Especially, when
their 3D structures are available, this approach can provide more
accurate information about possible distant evolutionary relation—
ships that are difficult to detect based on sequence information
alone. During the past two decades, many computational methods

have been developed for this purpose. However, most methods are
designed for protein structure comparison, and there is no currently
available tool (to the best of our knowledge) for comparing glycan
3D structures in a sequence order— and size—independent manner. In
particular, the branched nature of glycans makes it more difficult to
work with their structures. Nonetheless, considering that glycans
are one of the four fundamental classes of molecules that comprise
living systems and play an essential role in a vast array of biological
processes, there is an urgent need to develop a computational tool
for structural comparison of glycans.

Here, we introduce GS—align for glycan structure alignment and
similarity measurement. Our method works in a sequence order—
independent manner and provides size—independent scores for the
similarity of two glycan structures. We validate the reliability of our
method through PDB N—glycan library search and glycan conform—
ation comparison in the PDB homologous/non—homologous
N—glycoprotein sets. The results indicate that GS—align is a robust
computational tool to align glycan structures and quantify their
structural similarity.

GS—align was used to illustrate its potential application to tem—
plate—based glycan structure prediction. In the comparative structure
modeling, the accurate assessment of the quality of the templates
and the resulting model is essential to improve the structure predic—
tion algorithms. GS—align can play a key role in this task during the
development of glycan 3D structure prediction tools from glycan se—
quence information.

GS—align was also used to demonstrate its applicability to the
development of a monosaccharide substitution matrix for accurate
glycan sequence alignment. Aoki et al. developed a score matrix in a
manner similar to BLOSUM (Aoki et al., 2005). They defined the ap—
propriate classes of glycans and then produced glycan sequence
alignments within each class using their tree—structure local exact
matching algorithm. The alignment results were used to calculate the
frequency of sequence alignment of ‘links’, which includes two
monosaccharide names, an anomeric configuration (OI or [3), and con—
nection information (e.g. 1—6, 1—4). On the other hand, we attempted
to use the frequency of structural alignment of ‘residues’, which con—
sists of a monosaccharide name, its anomeric configuration and the
linkage information to any linked sugars. The current state of glycan
data is not yet complete (Aoki et al., 2005), and it may make such a
substitution matrix less reliable. To work around this problem, uti—
lizing glycan fragments (Jo and Im, 2013) instead of whole structures
could be an approach to increase the number of aligned monosac—
charides for better statistics. Although our approach needs to be
refined and statistically analyzed for validation, we expect that as in
protein structure alignment, glycan structure alignment can eventu—
ally provide glycan sequence alignments with an accuracy that would
not be achievable from sequence alignments alone, leading to better
consideration of distant evolutionary relationships. The advanced
measurement of glycan sequence similarity will also play a key role
in accurate identification of better templates for comparative model—
ing—based glycan structure prediction.

The current GS—score is based on the coordinates of sugar ring
centroids (sugar ring atoms) and glycosidic oxygen atoms for align—
ment (scoring). This approach can be efficiently used to search for
an optimal alignment focusing on the topological similarity of
glycans with significantly reduced computational costs. However,
well—aligned monosaccharides could have different orientations of
hydroxyl groups that can be modified with diverse chemical groups
(e.g. amine, acetic acid, lactic acid, phosphate, sulfate, etc.).
Therefore, it might be necessary to incorporate physicochemical fea—
tures of the hydroxyl groups and chemical modifications into the

current scoring function for more accurate measurement of the
structural similarity. In addition, the current GS—align cannot handle
furanoses forms (five—membered rings) of monosaccharides.
Furanoses are often ignored by researchers because they are very
minor compared to pyranose forms in overall glycan composition.
In the PDB N—glycan library used in this study, there is only one
glycan with a furanose ring. However, it is known that furanose
monosaccharides are also a common constituent of O—glycans of
plant glycoproteins and present in a number of glycoproteins of bac—
teria and protozoa (Lis and Sharon, 1993), suggesting a need of
accounting for furanose rings in the GS—align scoring function.
These will be done in future work.

Compared with the mature field of protein structure prediction
and modeling, the current status of in silico structural glycobiology
is rudimentary at best because of the paucity of computational tools.
We hope that GS—align can be applied to diverse subjects involving
structure comparison of glycans and eventually for addressing biolo—
gical questions related to glycan functions.

Abstract

Motivation: Vaccines represent the most effective and cost—efficient weapons against a wide range
of diseases. Nowadays new generation vaccines based on subunit antigens reduce adverse effects
in high risk individuals. However, vaccine antigens are often poor immunogens when administered
alone. Adjuvants represent a good strategy to overcome such hurdles, indeed they are able to: en—
hance the immune response; allow antigens sparing; accelerate the specific immune response;
and increase vaccine efficacy in vulnerable groups such as newborns, elderly or immuno—
compromised people. However, due to safety concerns and adverse reactions, there are only a few
adjuvants approved for use in humans. Moreover, in practice current adjuvants sometimes fail to
confer adequate stimulation. Hence, there is an imperative need to develop novel adjuvants that
overcome the limitations of the currently available licensed adjuvants.

Results: We developed a computational framework that provides a complete pipeline capable of
predicting the best citrus—derived adjuvants for enhancing the immune system response using, as
a target disease model, influenza A infection. In silico simulations suggested a good immune effi—
cacy of specific citrus—derived adjuvant (Beta Sitosterol) that was then confirmed in vivo.

1 Introduction

 

Vaccines are the most effective and cost—efficient means to prevent
infectious diseases. Nowadays the approaches to develop novel and
safer vaccines require the use of well—characterized antigens, such as
purified proteins, peptides or carbohydrates. Unfortunately, often,

these so—called subunit antigens are poor immunogens when admin—
istered alone. Therefore, additional adjuvants are required to pc—
tentiate the immune response. Adjuvants can be used for various
purposes: (i) to enhance, accelerate or prolong the immunogenicity

of highly purified or recombinant antigens; (ii) to reduce the antigen
dose or the number of immunizations needed for protective immun—
ity; (iii) to improve the efficacy of vaccines in high risk population
such as newborns, elderly or immune—compromised people; (iv) as
antigen delivery systems for the uptake of antigens by the mucosa;
and/0r (v) to protect the antigens from degradation (depot effect).
Adjuvants may also have significant effects on the nature of the im—
mune responses, and can tilt the immune system in favor of T helper
1 (Th1) or T helper 2 (Th2) type response.

Adjuvants can be generally classified into two groups. The first
group is composed of delivery vehicles that are used to manage the
storage, releasing and presentation of vaccine antigens to the im—
mune system. This group includes mineral salts, emulsions, lipo—
somes and virosomes. The second group is composed of
immunostimulants. Immunostimulants are compounds that aim to
improve the immune responses to specific vaccine antigens by stimu—
lating the releasing of cytokines through various mechanisms (i.e.
MHC molecules, costimulatory signals or intracellular signaling
pathways). In this group, it is possible to find Toll—like receptor
(TLR) agonists, cytokines and saponins (Montomoli et (11., 2011 ).

The first adjuvant activity was discovered empirically in 1926
with diphtheria toxoid absorbed to alum (Glenny et (11., 1926). Since
then, despite several decades of research, aluminium—based mineral
salts (alum) remains the most used and approved adjuvant for
human vaccines (Marrack et (11., 2009). Alum has a good track re—
cord of safety and it has been considered the adjuvant of choice for
vaccination against infections that can be prevented by antibody re—
sponses, and as such it has been widely and successfully used in
many licensed vaccines. However, some limitations of alum are also
well known. Alum fails to confer adequate increase of antibody re—
sponse to small peptides as well as certain vaccines, such as typhoid
fever and inﬂuenza vaccines. Notably, alum is known to be a poor
adjuvant for induction of cytotoxic T cell immunity and Th1 re—
sponses, which are required to combat several life—threatening infec—
tions (Huckriede et (11., 2005).

There is, then, an urgent need to develop novel adjuvants to sup—
port the development of vaccines against pathogens that have been
so far refractory to the traditional vaccination strategies, to address
effective vaccines against unmet medical need. In particular, the
need of new adjuvants capable of boosting the immune responses of
individuals with a lower or compromised immune system response,
such as the elderly and immune—compromised populations, repre—
sents a major challenge of our times.

Although a lot of effort has focused on the development of new
adjuvants, which include mineral salts, detoxified toxins, lipopepti—
des, emulsions, cytokines, polysaccharides and nucleic acids, very
few are presently approved for human use. There are in fact many
issues that hinder the development of new adjuvants, including the
development of local or systemic side effects. If the most common
local reactions to adjuvants include pain, injection site necrosis,
swelling, granulomas, lymphadenopathy, ulcers and abscesses, the
most common systemic side—effects are represented by nausea, arth—
ritis, fever, eosinophilia, uveitis, anaphylaxis, immunosuppression
or autoimmune diseases (Allison and Byars, 1991). Even alum is not
free from side effects such as fever and muscle soreness.

Moreover, difficulty of manufacture, poor stability and high pro—
duction costs represent other unresolved issues of the adjuvant de—
velopment pipeline. A deep scientific understanding of novel
adjuvants is indeed compulsory to set up the required nonclinical
safety testing programs, and even more testing programs are in gen—
eral required for synthetic, nonhuman, derivatives of toxic com—
pounds and protein—based adj uvants.

Accumulating evidence suggests that selected naturally derived
components (such as, e.g. ﬂavonoids and vitamins) collectively
referred to as nutritive adjuvants have immunomodulating proper—
ties (Vajdy, 2011). Consequently, a good starting point for the de—
velopment of new and potentially effective adjuvants may to adopt
naturally derived products, and their use may also lead to reduced
toxicity and faster development.

There are many biotechnological methodologies for evaluating the
efficacy of potential adjuvants, ranging from in vitro to in vivo tech—
niques. Such techniques have often been coupled with the use of in silico
techniques to speed up the identification of novel candidate adjuvants.

However, a complete pipeline encompassing initial selection (based
on literature searches or in vitro studies), in silico evaluations at the
molecular and cellular level, and in vivo trials, has yet to be developed.

The combination of in silica, in vitro and in vivo studies organ—
ized in a rationale manner at both molecular, cellular and systemic
scales may represent major advance in the identification of potential
novel adjuvants.

In this article, we present a computational framework that connects
and integrates an in silico molecular evaluation, based on the virtual
screening technique, with an ad [706 agent—based simulator to search
and predict the best citrus—derived adjuvants able to enhance the im—
mune system response. As a target disease model, we chose inﬂuenza
A, using, as a candidate vaccine, the inﬂuenza A virosome. Finally, the
predictions made by the simulation framework were validated in vivo.

1.1 The starting point: adjuvants derived from citrus
Plant extracts or purified component from plants have been eval—
uated for their activity as immunostimulant or immunomodulator,
of which extracts from Quilla/a saponaria Molina have proved the
most successful when applied as a vaccine adjuvant. Indeed, the
Quil A, a mixture partially purified of the crude extract of Quilla/a
saponaria Molina, is contained in several veterinary vaccines. A fur—
ther purified saponin fraction named QS—21 is currently approved as
a vaccine adjuvant for human use. Saponin fractions extracted from
several other plants have been also tested as adjuvant with promis—
ing results, including Ginseng saponins, Panax notoginseng sap—
onins, Platycodon grandiﬂorum saponins, Polygala saponins, soya
saponins and many others (Hong—Xiang et (11., 2009).

Although the chemical structure of phytosterols is very well
known since 1922, their effects on human and animal health have
been understimated (Bouic, 2001). Among the phytosterols intro—
duced by the diet, beta sitosterol is the most predominant sterol in
the human herbal nutrition (Weihrauch and Gardner, 1978)

Hesperidin is an abundant and inexpensive by—product of citrus
cultivation. It represents the major ﬂavonoid in sweet orange and
lemon (Garg et (11., 2001). In the literature, there is some evidence to
suggest that Hesperidin is a possible immunomodulatory compound
in the vaccine field, with promising activity as an adjuvant (differen—
tial effect of hesperidin on Th1, Th2, Th17 and proinﬂammatory
cytokines production from splenocyte of Schistosoma mansoni—
infected mice (Gamal and Abdelaziz, 2013)).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Virtual screening

Virtual screening is a powerful computational method that can be
used to identify potential ligands for a specific biological target
starting from a library of compounds. It can be classified into ligand
based and structure based when the screening is performed by infor—
mation contained in a pharmacophore model or by multiple docking

calculations. The former technique does not necessarily require
knowledge of the biological target because the identification of the
potential ligands is based on the molecular features needed for their
recognition as activators or inhibitors. This set of molecular features
is the pharmacophore model. Structure—based virtual screening is
more expensive in terms of computational time, but can obtain
more reliable results because the affinity of each candidate ligand
with the biological target is evaluated by a scoring function.
However, it requires the three—dimensional structure of the inter—
action partner; the most common source of experimentally resolved
structures is Protein Data Bank, but although the number of struc—
tures it contains is growing, not all biological targets are available.
Moreover, a virtual screening methodology is unable to predict and
analyze the immune system dynamics as a whole.

A set of 148 molecules present in the essential oil of orange peel
were collected (data not shown) by carrying out a systematic search
in the primary literature. The three—dimensional structures were
downloaded from PubChem (Bolton et (11., 2008) and for the mol—
ecules with unknown stereochemistry or geometric isomerism, all
possible isomers were generated and considered as separate chemical
entities. An extensive conformational analysis was carried out using
the Boltzman Jump method implemented in AMMP software
(http://grid.cs.gsu.edu/~cscrwh/ammp/ammp.html) and the lowest
energy conformation was further optimized by performing a semi—
empirical calculation with the Mopac 2012 program (http://
OpenMOPAC.net).

The crystal structure of the mouse TLR4/MD—2/LPS complex
was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 3VQ2) and
was completed by adding hydrogens, fixing the atom charges using
the Gasteiger—Marsili method (Ohto et (11., 2012) and the
CHARMM 22 potentials for proteins (MacKerell et (11., 1998), using
the features included in VEGA ZZ package (Pedretti et (11., 2002).
After this step, the model was optimized through a conjugate gradi—
ents minimization (50.000 steps) to reduce the high—energy steric
interactions, and to preserve the experimental data, atom con—
straints were applied to the protein backbone using NAMD 2.9
(Phillips et (11., 2005) integrated in the graphic environment of
VEGA ZZ. Finally, LPS was removed from the complex to create
the pocket required to identify LPS—mimetics by virtual screening
calculations.

2.2 The influenza a conceptual model

The biological scenario and the dynamics of inﬂuenza A need to be
described in a rational manner before they can be translated into a
mathematical/computational description. This means that the de—
scription must capture the essential properties of the phenomenon,
i.e. the system entities, how they are organized, and their dynamic
behavior. The role of a conceptual model is then to drive biological
knowledge into a solvable mathematical representation, offering a
conceptual framework for thinking about the scientific domain and
allowing the inclusion of additional properties in the same scheme
with limited effort.

To satisfy the above properties, the first task in building a solid
conceptual model is to identify all the relevant entities and their
properties (cells, molecules, cytokines and interactions) that biolo—
gists and medical doctors recognize as crucial to the scenario. Next,
one has to categorize all the interactions among entities that play a
relevant role in the game. These must be described using biological
knowledge inside a logical framework such that it is possible, as a
further step, to map them from the biological world to a mathemat—
ical/computational one. The final step is to set all the biological

constants, relevant functions, and identify the optimal computa—
tional framework for hosting the simulated biological scenario.

The dynamics of cells is realized by state—changes: each cellular
entity is labeled by a suitable state that describes its current biolo—
gical condition (naive, activated, duplicating and so on). The state
can change when a cell interacts with another cell, with a molecule
or with both of them.

We considered all the relevant lymphocytes that affect in some
way the biological scenario. In inﬂuenza A, immune system re—
sponse—both B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes—must be con—
sidered. Plasma B cells (P) were inserted as specific antibodies
producers. Both cytotoxic T cells (TC) and helper T cells (TH) were
inserted in the model. Monocytes are represented as well, as are
macrophages (M). Dendritic cells play an important role in this in—
fection. Two major types of dendritic cells have been discovered and
have been named conventional (cDC) and plasmacytoid dendritic
cells (pDC). pDCs are not able to present the antigen, so we repre—
sented only cDC in the model, along with their specific capability of
processing and cross—presenting viral antigen peptides both in major
histocompatibility complex class I (MHC—I) and major histocom—
patibility complex class II (MHC—H) molecules.

Toll—like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key
role in the innate immune system. These receptors are usually ex—
pressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells that
recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes.
In particular, TLR—4 is able to recognize bacterial products, several
viral proteins, polysaccharide and a variety of endogenous proteins
such as low—density lipoprotein, beta—defensins and heat shock pro—
tein (Brubaker et (11., 2015).

We modeled the TLR—4 receptors in macrophages and dendritic
cells to simulate their activation when triggered by citrus—derived
adjuvants.

The Influenza A virus mainly infects the epithelium of the re—
spiratory tract (Newby et (11., 2006) and its target is represented by
epithelial cells (EPs). In spite of this, we did not model the dynamics
of the EPs infected by Inﬂuenza A virus, but we tested the vaccin—
ation strategy using a virosome. Inﬂuenza A virosomes are virus—like
particles, consisting of reconstituted inﬂuenza virus envelopes de—
void of the nucleocapsid, including the genetic material of the source
virus. Indeed, they contain functional viral envelope glycoproteins:
inﬂuenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inter—
calated in the phospholipid bilayer membrane and they are unable
to replicate and infect target cells, but act only as pure fusion—active
vesicles (Huckriede et (11., 2005).

These functional characteristics of virosomes form the basis for
their enhanced immunogenicity. It has been shown that a physical
association between the virosome and the antigen of interest is ne—
cessary for the full adjuvant effect of virosomes (Bungener et (11.,
2002). The repetitive arrangement of haemagglutinin molecules on
the virosomal surface mediates a cooperative interaction between
the antigen and Ig receptors on B lymphocytes, stimulating strong
antibody responses. In addition, virosomes interact efficiently with
antigen—presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, resulting in activa—
tion of T lymphocytes. The fusion of the virosomes with the endoso—
mal membrane results in the major histocompatibility class I
presentation pathway gaining access to part of the virosomal anti—
gen, thus priming cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity.

In the light of these properties, virosomes represent an innova—
tive, broadly applicable adjuvant and carrier system with prospect—
ive applications in areas beyond conventional vaccines, especially in
stimulation of vaccine immunogenicity.

Natural killer cells (NK) have an important role in fighting virus—
infected cells and tumor cells. However, some studies (Achdout
et al., 2003, 2008) suggest that the inﬂuenza virus uses a novel
mechanism for the inhibition of NK cell activity by means of MHC
class I proteins redistributions on the cell surface and their accumu—
lation in the lipid raft microdomains. This leads to better recognition
by the NK inhibitory receptors and consequently amplifies resist—
ance to NK cell aggression (Wang et al., 2000). It seems that this
mechanism of evading NK cell attack does not affect T cell activity.
At this stage, we did not take account of NK outcomes, as we did
not have any infected EP cells.

Several molecular entities have an important role in simulating
the inﬂuenza A infection scenario. The model distinguishes between
simple small molecules, such as interleukins or signaling molecules
in general, and more complex molecules, such as immunoglobulins
and antigens, for which we need to represent the specificity.
Regarding the interleukin class molecules, we represent interleukin 2
(IL—2) that is necessary for the development of T cell immunologic
memory, one of the unique characteristics of the immune system,
which depends upon the expansion of the number and function of
antigen—selected T cell clones. As stated above, the model also takes
into account interferons type I (both 0c and ,8). They drive two spe—
cific functions inside the simulation. The first is directed against the
virus, inhibiting viral replication within the infected cell. The second
function induces an antiviral state in surrounding cells (Stark et al.,
1998). A mechanism for representing immunoglobulin class switch—
ing has also been incorporated. Immunoglobulins of both IgG1 and
IgG2a are represented as well.

The model takes into consideration a 2D domain physical space,
bounded by two opposite rigid walls and left and right periodic
boundaries. Although this imposes a limitation in terms of the repre—
sentation of space, all the processes and interactions of the simulated
scenario take place in epithelium of the respiratory tract and in the
surrounding lymph nodes. Hence, this is a good approximation and
gives to the model implementation improvements in both speed and
simplicity.

Using our previous experiences in the field of simulation of dif—
ferent pathologies and related immune responses (Castiglione et al.,
2007; Palladini et al., 2010; Pennisi et al., 2015; Pappalardo et al.,
2014), we chose to adopt an agent—based modeling (ABM) approach
as a cellular computational framework. The advantages of this
method are well known: both entities and biological functions and
interactions can be described in terms that are very similar to the
biological world. At the same time, this approach allows a mathem—
atician or a computer scientist to describe the scenario using a logic
and rational framework. Last but not the least, the ABM approach
allows ﬂexibility and further extension of the model to be achieved
without significant additional effort.

Compared to the complexity of the real biological scenario of in—
ﬂuenza A infections, the model is still naive and it could be extended
in many respects. However, the model is sufficiently complete and is
able to describe the major aspects of the immune system response
dynamics when stimulated by citrus—derived adjuvants.

2.3 The simulation framework

The simulation framework we developed is made of two main com—
ponents. The first component is represented by the real simulator en—
gine that we called SimFluAdj (SFA for short). The second
component consists of an application that converts virtual screening
results into simulation parameters that measure the affinity level of

the selected adjuvants against TLR—4. Figure 1 gives a general over—
view of the complete computational framework.

The computer implementation of SFA has three main classes of
parameters: (i) values known from the standard immunology litera—
ture (Abbas et al., 2014); (ii) parameters strictly correlated with the
specific biological scenario we want to simulate, i.e. parameters that
measure the inﬂuenza A virosome dynamics, matching its behavior
and its interactions with those of the host immune system (Baccam
et al., 2006; Carrat et al., 2008; Doherty et al., 2006; Grayson and
Holtzman, 2007; Lamb and Krug, 2001); (iii) parameters with un—
known values which we set to plausible values after performing a
series of tests. Table 1 details the values of the parameters retrieved
from the literature, along with the specific parameters of the inﬂu—
enza A virosome. With the number of particles set to 100, it is able
to generate an immune response that behaves as observed in litera—
ture (Huckriede et al., 2005).

SFA also has a set of free parameters that can be used to tune the
model results with experimental data. The list of these parameters
and their final values are quoted in Table 2. Tuning parameters
were set using our previous experience in modeling and captured
from discussions with biologists. The first parameter we set is
nbit_str that determines the repertoire size. Its integer value deter—
mines the number of bits used to represent the molecules’ and the
cells’ binding sites, such as cell receptors and antigen peptides and
epitopes. nbit_str was set to 12, corresponding to a potential reper—
toire of 4096 possible cell receptors. This is obviously very limited
in comparison to the real immunological repertoire, but it was suffi—
cient to capture the global behavior of the inﬂuenza A infection pro—
cess. The parameter min_match specifies the minimal number of
matching bits that are required to have a non—zero probability for
binding to occur; afﬂnityJei/el is the probability of an interaction
between two binding sites whose match is min_match; max_lfact
regulates the probability that a duplicating cell will create a new
cell; IL2_eff and IFN1_eff are factors expressing the efficiency of
interleukin—2 in stimulating growth of the lymphocytes and the effi—
ciency of IFN—1 in exploiting its function of antiviral effect respect—
ively; thymus_eff represents the efficiency of the thymus in selecting

non self—reactive thymocytes. In general, the fraction of circulating
auto—reactive TH cells should be below 0.1%.

With these settings, the model showed a good robustness, giving
reasonable output. This means that if we slightly change parameters
such as the initial leukocyte formula, the half life of entities, and so
on, the model consistently varies its results, without biological dis—
crepancy when compared with available experimental data retrieved
from the above cited literature.

To take into account all time—related values, we set a time step of
simulation to the value of 2 h.

Parameter 17347631;th is the per—bit mutation probability for anti—
bodies. The hyper—mutation rate of antibodies is taken as the sug—
gested value in Celada and Seiden (1996); plasmaJeI controls the
quantity of specific IgG antibodies directed against the inﬂuenza A
virosome released by a plasma B cell at each time step; prob_M_Ag
is the probability for a macrophage to phagocytosejinternalize an
antigen; prob_M_I C is the probability for a macrophage to phago—
cytose an immune complex; prob_cDC_Ag is the probability for a
dendritic cell to phagocytose/internalize a virosome antigen. This
was set to a higher level than the prob_M_Ag as DC are known to
be more effective antigen presenting cells; B_dup is the number of
time steps required by a B cells to create a copy of itself when dupli—
cating; TH_dup is the number of time steps required by a TH cell to
create a copy of itself when duplicating; TC_dup is the number of
time steps required by a TC cell to create a copy of itself when
duplicating.

SFA takes account of the main immune system functions and
particular characteristics, such as the diversity of specific elements,
major histocompatibility class restrictions, clonal selection by anti—
gen affinity, thymus education of T cells, antigen processing and
presentation (both the cytosolic and endocytic pathways are

implemented), cell—cell cooperation, homeostasis of cells created by
the bone marrow, hypermutation of antibodies, cellular and hu—
moral responses and immune memory. Receptors, ligands and im—
mune system specificity are implemented in SFA by a bit-string
polyclonal lattice method. This was well—described method and the
interested reader can find additional information in specific litera—
ture (Farmer et al., 1986; Motta et al., 2005; Thorne et al., 2007).

Immune system entities interact both with each other and with
the cells and molecules of the body. From the point of view of biol—
ogy, an interaction is a complex event that includes chemical, biolo—
gical and dynamical actions. To capture the spirit of the entities’
interactions, we adopt the same method that worked well in other
cases we have simulated. We implemented both the recognition
phase and the affinity eventually enhanced by adjuvants. When two
entities that are capable of interacting lie in the same lattice site,
they interact with a probabilistic law. All entities that may interact
and are in the same site have a positive interaction.

The simulator takes care of the main interactions that happen
during an immune response against inﬂuenza A infection. We

included the following interactions.

2.3.1 B lymphocyte recognition of an influenza A virosome

If a B lymphocyte expresses on its surface a membrane immuno—
globulin that is specific for the antigen, it internalizes the antigen
complexed with the membrane immunoglobulin and turns the anti—
gen into peptides that are presented by MHC class II molecules at
the B lymphocyte surface. Hence, the lymphocyte B cell becomes an
antigen presenting cell.

2.3.2 B lymphocyte and helper T lymphocyte interaction

If the T receptor (CD4) at the surface of a T helper lymphocyte binds
specifically peptide/MHC—II at the surface of the antigen presenting
B lymphocyte, the helper T lymphocyte proliferates and secretes
interleukin 2. At the same time, B lymphocyte proliferates and dif—
ferentiates into a plasma cell.

2.3.4 Macrophage and helper T lymphocyte interaction

If a T cell receptor (CD4) at the surface of T helper lymphocyte
binds specifically peptide/MHC—II at the surface of antigen process—
ing macrophage cell, helper T lymphocyte proliferates and secretes
interleukin 2.

2.3.5 Macrophage and immune complex interaction

If a macrophage encounters an immune complex (specific IgG at—
tached with inﬂueza A virus), the macrophage phagocytoses the im—

2.3.6 Macrophage with inﬂuenza A virosome

If a macrophage encounters inﬂuenza A virosome, the macrophage
internalizes the antigen and processes it into peptides that are then
presented by MHC— II at the macrophage surface. Hence, the macro—
phage becomes an antigen presenting cell.

2.3.7 Dendritic cell with inﬂuenza A virosome

If a cDC encounters inﬂuenza A virosome, the cDC internalizes the
antigen and processes it into peptides that are then presented by
MHC—II or by MHC— I (cross—presentation ability of cDCs) at the
dendritic cell surface. Hence, the cDC becomes an antigen present—
ing cell.

2.3.8 Inﬂuenza A virosome with IgG interaction
If a soluble immunoglobulin specific for the virus encounters this
antigen, it binds to it and forms an immune complex.

2.3.9 Cytotoxic T cell with antigen presenting cDC interaction

If a T cell receptor (CD8) at the surface of cytotoxic T lymphocyte
binds specifically peptide/MHC— I at the surface of antigen—
processing dendritic cell, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte become acti—
vated (primed).

Physical proximity is modeled through the concept of a lattice—
site. All interactions among cells and molecules take place within a
lattice—site in a single time step, so that there is no correlation be—
tween entities residing on different sites at a fixed time.

The simulation space is represented by an L x L hexagonal (or
triangular) lattice (six neighbors), with periodic boundary condi—
tions to the left and right side, while the top and bottom are repre—
sented by rigid walls. All entities are allowed to move with uniform
probability between neighboring lattices in the grid with an equal
diffusion coefficient. In the present release of the simulator, chemo—
taxis is not implemented.

The second component of the computational framework is repre—
sented by an application which integrates a translation function
from the virtual screening docking scores into the corresponding bit—
strings which are able to represent the same predicted affinity levels
against TLR—4 receptors inside the simulator. This translation func—
tion has been obtained by initially defining the requested affinity lev—
els for the SFA simulator, in terms of mismatching bits, for some of
the predicted screening results (i.e. the best scoring : the maximum
affinity). This data has been then used with a polynomial interpol—
ation of the third order which fitted best with the input data in re—
spect to other interpolation techniques we tested (R2 : 0.9062). The
resulting function is then used to obtain the number of mismatching
bits that best represent any predicted virtual screening result, and
thus to produce inside the SFA simulator string receptors with the
requested number of mismatching bits.

2.4 Virosome preparation

A solution containing 1 mg of inactivated inﬂuenza A/H1N1
Singapore 6/86 was centrifuged for 90 min at 286,000 X g. The pel—
let was dissolved in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.1 M
Octaethyleneglycol mono (n—dodecyl) ether (OEG) (Sigma Aldrich),
and mixed with 32 mg of phosphatidylcholine (Lipoid Ag) dissolved
in 1.5 ml of PBS — OEG 0.1M. The mixture was then centrifuged for
30min at 100,000 ><g and the supernatant sterile filtered (0.22 m
Millipore). Virosomes were then formed by detergent removal using
SM2 Bio—Beads (Bio Rad). Final inﬂuenza hemagglutinin content
was of 0.075 mg/ml, as determined by single radial diffusion.

2.5 Size determination

Size determination and distribution of the particle population was
performed by a Zetasizer Nano instrument (Malvern Instruments).
20111 of virosome sample was added to filtered PBS buffer in a final
cuvette volume of 1 ml. As shown (Fig. 2) the mean size of the inﬂu—
enza virosome is 117.6 nm with a polidispersity index of 0.1.

2.6 Mice and immunizations

Immunization experiments were performed in Balb/c mice (Harlan).
Mice were housed in appropriate animal care facility and handled
according to EU guidelines. Balb/c mice were randomly divided in
the following groups (five mice per group) and labeled: group (A)
PBS; group (B) virosome+hesperidin 11ig; group (C)

immunized two times at three weeks interval (days 0 and 21), and
euthanized one week after the last immunization. Blood collection
was performed at 35 days after the first immunization and sera sam—
ples were stored at —20°C till use. During the whole experiment,
the animals were monitored and their weight recorded.

2.7 ELISA setting

Ninety six wells plates (Costar) were coated overnight at 4 °C with
100 #1 per well of a 10 gig/ml solution of whole inactivated inﬂuenza
virus A/H1N1/Singap0re Na2CO3 0.05M pH 9.6. Wells were then
blocked with 200 #1 per well of 10% milk powder in PBS solution
for 1 h at 37°C, followed by one wash with PBS. Plates were then
incubated with serial dilutions of the mouse serum in PBS containing
0.05% Tween 20 and 3% milk powder for 1 h at 37°C. After being
washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween® 20, plates
were incubated with HRP—conjugated goat anti—mouse IgG, IgG1 or
IgG2a antibody (Sigma—Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C. After being washed
three further times, 100 pl TMB—substrate (Termo Fisher) was
added, and the plates were incubated in the dark at room tempera—
ture for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 #1 1M
H2SO4 and optical densities (OD) were read at 450 nm using a
Victor V (Perkin Elmer).

3 Results

The database of ligands for the virtual screenings was built from the
molecules known in the literature to be found in orange fruit ex—
tracts, and their 3D structures were downloaded from PubChem, or
built manually when not available. Moreover, to consider the possi—
bility of finding ligands not yet identified or present in very low
quantities in extracts, the database was merged with the molecules
included in Arita’s ﬂavonoid library (Arita and Suwa, 2008) that
were previously converted to 3D (Aldini et al., 201 1). So, the final li—
brary consists of 6893 molecules in a Microsoft Access database.
The structure—based virtual screening was carried out using the
PLANTS software (Korb et al., 2009), defining a sphere of 12  ra—
dius centered on the LPS barycentre in its crystallographic pose and
using PLP as the scoring function.

Betasitosterol, Linoleic Acid Ethyl Ester and Hesperidin were se—
lected among the best ranked score candidate adjuvants because, as
already detailed in Section 2.1, we found evidences of immune

Hesperidin+ virosome; C — Beta-Sitostero|+ virosome; D — Linoleic
Acid+virosome; E — Virosome only. Only beta sitoserol shows a good im-
mune system humoral response, also at the time of the second administra-
tion, showing the typical burst-response (memory effect)

modulator effects. Table 3 shows the best—ranked adj uvants by score
together with their scores.

The computational framework has been used to predict the ad—
ministration of the proposed adjuvants over five virtual mice groups
(Group (A) PBS + PC; Group (B) Virosome + Hesperidin 1 pg;
Group (C) Virosome + Beta—Sitosterol 1 pg; Group (D)
Virosome + Linoleic Acid Ethyl est. 1 pg; Group (E) Virosome with—
out Adjuvant). Fifty random simulations (random ‘in silico’ mice)
have been executed for each group, and mean values have been
taken into account. In Figure 2, we present the total IgG, IgG1 and
IgG2a levels obtained at day 35.

According to the in silico predictions, the best adjuvant is repre—
sented by Beta—Sitosterol, which is capable of promoting a very
strong humoral response when administered in conjunction with the
virosome. A lower immune system response is also obtained by
using hesperidin as the adjuvant, whereas the administration of lino—
leic acid did not bring any significant improvement in respect to the
virosome administration only.

In Figure 3, we show the temporal evolution of IgG dynamics for
virosome combined with Hesperidin (B), Beta—Sitosterol (C),
Linoleic Acid (D) and virosome only (E). In silico simulations show
that the administration of Linoleic Acid (D) seems to initially have a
detrimental effect in respect to the administration of the virosome
only (E). However, after the second immunization (day 21), a some—
what stronger immune response is capable of filling the gap between
the two treatments, as highlighted by the behavior of IgG1 antibod—
ies. Interestingly, both the administration of Hesperidin (B) and
Beta—Sitosterol (C) are able to elicit a very strong first response but,
as showed by IgG1 temporal dynamics, only the latter is able to im—
prove the immune response after the second immunization, whereas
the former partially loses its efficacy. We also report the dynamics
of IgM titers; however, these levels were not measured in in vivo

Fig. 4. In vivo results. Five groups of 5 balb/c mice were used. The first group
(A) has no treatment (placebo); the second group (B) is treated with the influ-
enza A virosome in conjunction with Hesperidin; the third group (C) is treated
with the influenza A virosome in conjunction with beta sitosterol; the fourth
group (D) is treated with the influenza A virosome in conjunction with linoleic
acid; the fifth group (E) is treated with the influenza A virosome only. The lev-
els of IgG, IgG1 and IgGZa are shown at day 35. Adjuvants dosage was of
MG, administered at day 0 and 21. The experiments last 40 days. In vivo trials
confirmed the predictions made by the in silico simulation framework

Fig. 5. In silica influenza-specific antibody titres. Five groups of 50 in silico
mice were simulated. The first group (A) has no treatment (placebo); the se-
cond group (B) is treated with the influenza A virosome in conjunction with
Hesperidin; the third group (C) is treated with the influenza A virosome in
conjunction with beta sitosterol; the fourth group (D) is treated with the influ-
enza A virosome in conjunction with linoleic acid; the fifth group (E) is treated
with the influenza A virosome only. The levels of IgG, IgG1 and IgGZa are
shown at day 35. Adjuvants plus virosome and virosome alone dosage were
of 1pg, administered at day 0 and 21. The in silico experiments last 40 days

experiments. Hence, we used the same parameter values as in our
previous works without tuning them. From a qualitative point of
view, the low concentration of IgM may be in agreement with the
general immunology literature. (Abbas et al., 2014; Gonzalez—
Quintela et al., 2008).

In silico predictions have then been tested in vivo according to
the procedure described in Section 2.6. In Figure 4, we show the IgG
levels obtained in vivo at day 35. From a comparison of the in vivo
and in silico experiments (Figs 4 and 5) it is possible to confirm that
the simulator is clearly able to capture the complexity of the prob—
lem by predicting Beta—Sitosterol as the best adjuvant of the pool.
The predicted Hesperidin effects seem to be slightly over estimated.
However, the in vivo experiment confirms that the use of
Hesperidin as adjuvant has a positive effect in comparison to the ad—
ministration of the virsome only, even if with less efficacy.

Finally, as showed by the in silico predictions, the use of Linoleic
Acid is useless for promoting the immunization. Indeed, the in vivo
results show that it negatively influences the effects of the immune

response. This was also partially highlighted by the SFA simulator,
but only at the time of the first immunization.

4 Conclusions

The need to develop a new generation of vaccine adjuvants is now
an imperative. This is in particular important for those vaccines
based on subunit antigens that provide superior safety over trad—
itional vaccines; however, they suffer from limited immunogenicity
when administered alone. There are few licensed adjuvants on the
market approved for human use. The majority of them are
Aluminium based. Even if alum has a good track record in terms of
safety, it has some well—known limitations, such as inadequate in—
crease of humoral response to small peptides and a poor stimulation
of cytotoxic T cell immunity and Th1 responses. The development
of new adjuvants is associated with two key problems: relevant side
effect and high production costs. Naturally derived compounds have
been demonstrated to provide a noteworthy immune system stimula—
tion with limited side effects. There are several biotechnological
methodologies, based on both in silica and in vivo techniques, to
study and suggest possible good naturally derived adjuvants candi—
dates. However, they are not able, on their own, to quantify and
analyze the immune system response globally. Computational simu—
lations may help in solving these issues, but these need to be inte—
grated with the in vitro and in silico molecular analyses. In this
work, we presented an integrated evaluation pipeline framework
that uses virtual screening technique to pre—select promising citrus
derived compounds that showed a good TLR—4 stimulation effects.
Then we analyzed these results with an agent—based simulator to
evaluate globally the immune system response using the pre—selected
adjuvants in conjunction with an inﬂuenza A virosome. The simula—
tion framework predicted that among the tested adjuvants, beta
sitosterol is the one that elicits a good immune response. Finally, we
tested in vivo the predicted results, finding a good agreement. This
shows that the proposed simulation framework may accelerate and
enhance the search and the development of adj uvants that may both
improve the overall vaccinations strategies efficacy and reduce un—
desirable side effects.

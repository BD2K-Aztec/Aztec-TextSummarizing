pfsearch next generation

 

Multithreading implementation is straightforward because
proﬁle alignment versus a database is in itself an embarrassingly
parallel task. For pfsearchV3, we implemented a masterislave
mechanism to analyse and adapt the load before each phase of
the algorithm (heuristic, filter, alignment), thus providing more
equitable shares between threads. This has some constraints:
sequences are read several times, but above all, they are no
longer accessed sequentially, so an index of the sequences has
to be either computed or loaded at start.

By combining the heuristic with our code optimization,
we achieved a 100>< increase in the speed of pfsearch on average.
To search 16 544 936 UniProtKB sequences (5 358 014 649
residues) required a mean of 98 s/prof11e (median of 73 s/prof11e).
A typical example of the runtime acceleration achieved is shown
in Table 1.

The heuristic version of pfsearch can be used to annotate large
sets of complete sequences in a reasonable amount of time on a
modern workstation. For example, the human proteome can
be searched with the totality of the PROSITE prof11e models in
<4 hours, and this time can be drastically reduced on machines
with a large number of CPU cores and/or computer clusters.
For fragmented sequences, users may inactivate the heuristic
to minimize loss of true—positive matches, in which case the
speed of execution will be determined by the number of
available CPU cores. We also plan to implement our heuristic
search method in the HAMAP pipeline that provides high
quality functional annotation for protein families (Pedruzzi
et al, 2013).

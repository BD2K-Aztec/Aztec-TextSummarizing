Note: The precision for cells marked as ‘NA’ could not be determined because of the low number of compounditarget predictions (<30).

3 PERFORMANCE

We assessed the performance of the target prediction method in
HitPick using as validation set 15% of all ligands that were not
part of the training set. When evaluating the highest scoring
target prediction for each compound, HitPick achieves a sensi—
tivity of 60.94% (with 66.16% being the maximum possible sen—
sitivity), a speciﬁcity of 99.99% and a precision of 92.11%, an
improvement over na'ive Bayesian models (sensitivity of 52.95%,
speciﬁcity of 99.98% and precision of 80.03%) and lNN simi—
larity searching (precision of 84.72%). HitPick performance is
comparable with the target prediction quality achieved by the
Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA), a well—known target
ﬁshing application that relates proteins based on the chemical
similarity of their ligands (Keiser et al., 2007) (data not shown).

We also evaluated the performance of the HitPick target pre—
diction method at different ranges of chemical similarity of the
query compound to the closest training compound and for up to
ﬁve top scoring known targets of this training molecule inde—
pendently. To obtain robust precision estimates, we require a
minimum of 30 compounditarget predictions for each target
rank in a given Tc interval (Table 1).

We observed that the precision increases with increasing Tc.
For compounds with a Tc of 30.7 to the training set, the ﬁrst
predicted target was nearly always correct. Furthermore, the pre—
cision reached at least 53% for a Tc in the range of 0.H.5
(Table 1) Thus, we chose 50% as default precision threshold
for the predicted targets on the web server.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

HitPick offers two independent functions. The ﬁrst function
identifies bioassay hits based on the B—score method and predicts
targets for up to 100 hits. As input, it requires the data from a
bioassay, including plate names, compound identiﬁers, well pos—
itions, activity values and SMILES strings. The output is a table
listing the hits and their chemical structures. This table is used
as input source for the target prediction method. The output of
the target prediction is a list of target predictions for the input
compounds ranked by decreasing precision.

In addition, HitPick allows the prediction of targets for up to
100 compounds independently from bioassay data. For this
second function, only SMILES strings are required as input.

To ensure a high reliability of the target prediction outcome,
HitPick reports only those targets per compound for which we

can reliably estimate the precision. The precision depends on
the similarity to the most similar compound in the set of
known interactions as well as on the rank of the target’s score.
Users can select different precision thresholds for the target pre—
diction results as desired. Under a lower threshold, more chem—
icals will have predictions at the cost of a lower precision.
In addition, an overview of the predicted targets is given in
form of pie chart.

The processing time for hit identiﬁcation depends on the size
of the assay data. For bioassays containing less than 5000, 10 000
and 100 000 compounds, the web server returns the results in less
than 1, 2 and 30min, respectively. The target prediction takes
~5 min per batch of query.

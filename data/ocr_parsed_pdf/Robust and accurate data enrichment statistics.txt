ABSTRACT

Motivation: Term-enrichment analysis facilitates biological interpre-
tation by assigning to experimentally/computationally obtained data
annotation associated with terms from controlled vocabularies. This
process usually involves obtaining statistical significance for each
vocabulary term and using the most significant terms to describe a
given set of biological entities, often associated with weights. Many
existing enrichment methods require selections of (arbitrary number
of) the most significant entities and/or do not account for weights
of entities. Others either mandate extensive simulations to obtain
statistics or assume normal weight distribution. In addition, most
methods have difficulty assigning correct statistical significance to
terms with few entities.

Results: Implementing the well-known Lugananni—Rice formula, we
have developed a novel approach, called SaddleSum, that is free
from all the aforementioned constraints and evaluated it against
several existing methods. With entity weights properly taken into
account, SaddleSum is internally consistent and stable with respect
to the choice of number of most significant entities selected.
Making few assumptions on the input data, the proposed method
is universal and can thus be applied to areas beyond analysis
of microarrays. Employing asymptotic approximation, SaddleSum
provides a term-size-dependent score distribution function that gives
rise to accurate statistical significance even for terms with few
entities. As a consequence, SaddleSum enables researchers to place
confidence in its significance assignments to small terms that are
often biologically most specific.

1 INTRODUCTION

A major challenge of contemporary biology is to ascribe interpre-
tation to high-throughput experimental or computational results,

where each considered entity (gene or protein) is assigned a value.
Biological information is often summarized through controlled
vocabularies such as Gene Ontology (GO; Ashburner et (11., 2000),
where each annotated term includes a list of entities. Let w denote
a collection of values, each associated with an entity. Given w
and a controlled vocabulary, enrichment analysis aims to retrieve
the terms that by statistical inference best describe w, that is, the
terms associated with entities with atypical values. Many enrichment
analysis tools have been developed primarily to process microarray
data (Huang et (11., 2009). In terms of biological relevance, the
performance assessment of those tools is generally difﬁcult. It
requires a large, comprehensive ‘gold standard’ vocabulary together
with a collection of W’s processed from experimental data, and
with true/false positive terms corresponding to each w correctly
speciﬁed. This invariably introduces some degree of circularity
because the terms often come from curating experimental results.
Before declaring efﬁcacy in biological information retrieval that is
non-trivial to assess, an enrichment method should pass at least the
statistical accuracy and internal consistency test.

In their recent survey, Huang et (11. (2009) list 68 distinct
bioinformatic enrichment tools introduced between 2002 and 2008.
Most tools share a similar workﬂow: given w obtained by suitably
processing experimental data, they sequentially test each vocabulary
term for enrichment to obtain its P-value (the likelihood of a false
positive given the null hypothesis). Since many terms are tested,
a multiple hypothesis correction, such as Bonferroni (Hochberg
and Tamhane, 1987) or false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995), is applied to P-value of each to obtain the ﬁnal
statistical signiﬁcance. The results are displayed for the user in a
suitable form outlining the signiﬁcant terms and possibly relations
between them. Note that the latter steps are largely independent from
the ﬁrst. To avoid confounding factors, we will focus exclusively on
the original enrichment P-values.

Based on the statistical methods employed, the existing
enrichment tools can generally be divided into two main classes.
The singular enrichment analysis (SEA) class contains numerous
tools that form the majority of published ones (Huang et (11., 2009).
By ordering values in w, these tools require users to select a number
of top-ranking entities as input and mostly use hypergeometric
distribution (or equivalently Fisher’s exact test) to obtain the term
P-values. After the selection is made, SEA treats all entities equally,
ignoring their value differences.

The gene set analysis (GSA) class was pioneered by the gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) tool (Mootha et (11., 2003; Subramanian
et (11., 2005). Tools from this class use all values (entire w) to

calculate P-values and do not require preselection of entities.
Some approaches (Al-Shahrour et (11., 2007; Blom et (11., 2007;
Breitling et (11., 2004; Eden et (11., 2009) in this group apply
hypergeometric tests to all possible selections of top-ranking
entities. The ﬁnal P-value is computed by combining (in a tool-
speciﬁc manner) the P-values from the individual tests. Other
approaches use non-pannneﬁic approaches rankkbased staﬁsﬁcs
such as Wilcoxon rank-sum (Breslin et (11., 2004) or Kolmogorov—
Smimov like (Backes et (11., 2007; Ben-Shaul et (11., 2005; Mootha
et (11., 2003; Subramanian et (11., 2005). When weights are taken
into account, such as in GSEA (Subramanian et (11., 2005),
statistical signiﬁcance must be determined from a sampled (shufﬂed)
distribution. Unfortunately, limited by the number of shufﬂes that
can be performed, the smallest obtainable P-value is bounded away
ﬁmnO.

The ﬁnal group of GSA methods computes a score for
each vocabulary term as a sum of the values (henceforth used
interchangeably with weights) of the m entities it annotates. In
general, the score distribution pdfm(S) for the experimental data is
unknown. By Central Limit Theorem, when m is large, Gaussian
(Kim and Volsky, 2005; Smid and Dorssers, 2004) or Student’s
pdﬁﬁibuﬁon(BoorﬁnaetaL,2005;LuoetaL,2009)canbetmedto
approximate pdfm(S). Unfortunately, when the weight distributions
are skewed, the required m may be too large for practical use.
Evidently, this undermines the P-value accuracy of small terms
(meaning terms with few entities), which are biologically most
speciﬁc.

It is generally found that, given the same vocabulary and w,
different enrichment analysis tools report diverse results. We believe
this may be attributed to disagreement in P-values reported as
well as that different methods have different degree of robustness
(internal consistency). Instead of providing a coherent biological
understanding, the array of diverse results questions the conﬁdence
of information found. Furthermore, other than microarray datasets,
there exist experimental or computational results such as those from
ChIP-chip (Eden et (11., 2007), deep sequencing (Sultan et (11., 2008),
quantitative proteomics (Sharma et (11., 2009) and in silico network
simulations (Stoj mirovic and Yu, 2007, 2009), that may beneﬁt from
enrichment analysis. It is thus imperative to have an enrichment
method that report accurate P-values, preserves internal consistency
and allows investigations of a broader range of datasets.

To achieve these goals, we have developed a novel enrichment
tool, called SaddleSum, that founds on the well-known Lugananni—
Rice formula (Lugannani and Rice, 1980) and derives its statistics
from approximating asymptotically the distribution ﬁinction of the
scores used in the parametric GSA class. This allows us to obtain
accurate statistics even in the cases where the distribution ﬁinction
generating w is very skewed and for terms containing few entities.
The latter aspect is particularly important for obtaining biologically
speciﬁc information.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mathematical foundations for SaddleSum

We distinguish two sets: the set of entities N of size n and the controlled
vocabulary V. Each term from V maps to a set M CN of size m < n. From
experimental results, we obtain a set w={wjleN} and ask how likely

it is to randomly pick m entities whose sum of weights exceeds the sum

S = 21-6 M Wj.

Assume that the weights in w come independently from a continuous
probability space W with the density function [7 such that the moment
generating function p(t)= pr(x)e”‘dx exists for t in a neighborhood of
0. The density of S , sum of m weights arbitrarily sampled from w, can be
expressed by the Fourier inversion formula

1 00 K * *s
pdtm(s): E [006»: (lt)—zt dz, (1)
where K (t) =ln p(t) denotes the cumulant generating function of p. The tail
probability or P-Value for a score S is given by

Prob(S z S) =  oopdfm(S)dS. (2)
S

We propose to use an asymptotic approximation to (2), which improves with
increasing In and S.

Daniels (1954) derived an asymptotic approximation for the density pdfm
through saddlepoint expansion of the integral (1), while the corresponding
approximation to the tail probability was obtained by Lugannani and
Rice (1980). Let ¢(x)=exp(—x2/2)/m and <I>(x)= ff" ¢(z)dt denote,
respectively, the density and the tail probability of Gaussian distribution.
Let 1: be a solution of the equation

§=mK’(X). (3)

Then, the leading term of the LugananniiRice approximation to the tail
probability takes the form

Probrszﬁ>=<1>rz>+<%— %)¢(2)+0(m‘3/2). (4)

where 9:1,xmxwi) and 2: sgn(1:),/ 2(1iS —mK(1:)). Appropriate

summary of derivation of (4) is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Daniels (1954) has shown that Equation (3) has a unique simple root under
most conditions and that 1: increases with S, with 1: = O for S =m (W) where
(W) = fwxp(x)dx is the mean of W. While the approximation (4) is uniformly
valid over the whole domain of [7, its components need to be rearranged for
numerical computation near the mean. When S >>m (W), ¢(2)/y dominates
and the overall error is 0(m‘1) (Daniels, 1987).

SaddleSum, our implementation of LugananniiRice approximation for
computing enrichment P-Values, ﬁrst solves Equation (3) for 1: using
Newton’s method and then returns the P-Value using (4). The derivatives
of the cumulant generating function are estimated from w: we approximate
the moment generating function by 110%;sz Ne’wf , and then K’(t)=
p’(t)/p(t) and K”(t) = p”(t)/p(t) — (K’(t))2. Since the same w is used to
sequentially evaluate P-Values of all terms in V, we retain previously
computed 1: values in a sorted array. This allows us, using binary search,
to reject many terms with P-Values greater than a given threshold without
running Newton’s method or to bracket the root of (3) for faster convergence.
More details on the SaddleSum implementation and evaluations of its
accuracy against some well-characterized distributions are in Section 2 of
Supplementary Materials. When run as a term-enrichment tool, SaddleSum
reports E-Value for each signiﬁcant term by applying Bonferroni correction
to the term’s P-Value.

2.2 G0

The assignment of human genes to GO terms was taken from the NCBI
gene2go ﬁle (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene2go.gz) downloaded on
February 7, 2009. After assigning all genes to terms, we removed all
redundant termsiif several terms mapped to the same set of genes, we kept
only one such term. For our statistical experiments, we kept only the terms
with no less than ﬁve mapped genes within the set of weights considered and
hence the number of processed terms varied for each realization of sampling
(see below).

2.3 Information ﬂow in protein networks

ITM Probe (Stojmirovic and Yu. 2009) is an implementation of
the framework for exploring information ﬂow in interaction networks
(Stojmirovic and Yu. 2007). Information ﬂow is modeled through discrete
time random walks with darnpingiat each step the walker has a certain
probability of leaving the network. Although ITM Probe offers three modes:
emitting. absorbing and channel. we only used the simplest. emitting mode. to
provide examples illustrating issues of signiﬁcance assignment. The emitting
mode takes as input one or more network proteins. called sources. and a
damping factor 01. For each protein node in the network. the model outputs
the expected number of Visits to that node by random walks originating from
the sources. thus highlighting the network neighborhoods of the sources.
The damping factor determines the average number of steps taken by a
random walk before termination: 01 = 1 corresponds to no termination. while
01:0 leads to no Visits apart from the originating node. For our proteini
protein interaction network examples. we used the set of all human physical
interactions from the BioGRID (Breitkreutz et (11.. 2008). version 2.0.54 (July
2009). The network consists of 7702 proteins and 56 400 unique interactions.
Each interaction was represented by an undirected link. A link carries weight
2 if its two ends connect to the same protein and 1 otherwise.

2.4 Microarrays

From the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; Barrett et (11.. 2009). we
retrieved human microarray datasets with expression logz ratios (weights)
provided. resulting in 34 datasets and 136 samples in total. For each sample.
when multiple weights for the same gene were present. we took their mean
instead. This resulted in a w where each gene is assigned a unique raw weight.
For evaluations. we also used another version of w where negative weights
were set to zero. This version facilitated investigation of upregulation while
keeping the downregulated genes as part of statistical background.

2.5 Evaluating accuracy of P-values

By deﬁnition. a P-Value associated with a score is the probability of
that score or better arising purely by chance. We tested the accuracy of
reported P-Values reported by enrichment methods Via simulations on ‘decoy’
databases. which contained only terms with random gene assignments. For
each term from the decoy dataset and each set of weights based on network or
microarray data. we recorded the reported P-Value and thus built an empirical
distribution of P-Values. If a method reports accurate P-Values. the proportion
of runs. which we term empirical P-Value. reporting P-Values smaller than
or equal to a P-Value cutoff. should be very close to that cutoff. We show the
results graphically by plotting on the logilog scale the empirical P-Value as
a function of the cutoff.

For each given list of entities N. be it from the target gene set of a
microarray dataset or the set of participating human proteins in the interaction
network. we produced two types of decoy databases. The ﬁrst type was
based on GO. We shufﬂed gene labels 1000 times. For each shufﬂe. we
associated all terms from G0 with the shufﬂed labels to retain the term
dependency. This resulted in a database with ~5 X 106 terms (1000 shufﬂes
times about 5000 GO terms). In the second type. each term. having the same
size m. was obtained by sampling without replacement m genes from N.
The databases from this type (one for each term size considered) contained
exactly 107 terms. The evaluation query set of 100 w’s from interaction
networks was obtained by randomly sampling 100 proteins out of 7702 and
running ITM Probe with each protein as a single source. The weights for
source proteins were not considered since they were prescribed. not resulting
from simulation. Each run used 0120.7. without excluding any nodes from
the network. For microarrays. the set of 136 samples was used. Since both
query sets are of size ~102. the total number of witerm matches was ~109.

2.6 Student’s t-test (used by GAGE and T-proﬁler)

Similar to SaddleSum. t-test approaches are based on sum-of-weights score.
but use the Student’s t-distribution to infer P-Values. As before. let wj denote

the weight associated with entity j EN. let M denote the set of m entities
associated with a term from vocabulary and let M’ =N\M. For any set
8 EN of size 8. let xs = g 21.68 wj denote the mean weight of entities in
S and let s; = ﬂ 21-68 wj —)r$)2 be their sample variance.

GAGE (Luo et (11.. 2009) enrichment tool uses two sample t-test assuming
unequal variances and equal sample sizes to compare the means over N
and M. The test statistic is

,2 M (5)

,/.v3\A/m+sjzv/m

and the P-Value is obtained from the upper tail of the Student’s t-distribution
with degrees of freedom

(savl + sir )2

v=(m— 1)
sx1+sjv

T-proﬁler (Boorsma et (11.. 2005) compares the means oVer M and M’ using
two sample t-test assuming equal variances but unequal sample sizes. The
pooled variance estimate is given by

The T-proﬁler P-Value is then obtained from the tail of the Student’s
t-distribution with v=n—2 degrees of freedom.

2.7 Hypergeometric distribution

Methods based on hypergeometric distribution or equivalently. Fisher’s exact
test. use only rankings of weights and require selection of ‘signiﬁcant’ entities
prior to calculation of P-Value. We ﬁrst rank all entities according to their
weights and consider the set C of c entities with largest weights. The number
0 can be ﬁxed (say 50). correspond to a ﬁxed percentage of the total number
of weights. depend on the values of weights. or be calculated by other means.
The score S for the term M is given by the size of the intersection. C OM.
between C and M. This is equivalent to setting S 221-6 M wj with wj :1

for j EC and 0 otherwise. The P-Value for score S is

min(c,m) (or) (rt—n1)
Prob(S : S) = Z c"

 (2)

Hence. the P-Value measures the likelihood of score S or better over all
possible ways of selecting c entities out of N. with m entities associated
with the term investigated.

In each of our P-Value accuracy experiments. we used two variants of the
hypergeometric method. one taking a ﬁxed percentage of nodes and the other
taking into account the values of weights. For microarray datasets. the ﬁst
variant took 1% of available genes (HGEM-PNl). while the second select
genes with four fold change or more (HGEM-F2). In experiments based on
protein networks. we took 3% of available proteins (231 entities) for the ﬁrst
variant (HGEM-PN3) and used the participation ratio formula to determine
0 in the second (HGEM-PR). Participation ratio (Stojmirovic and Yu. 2007)
is given by the formula

2
_ (ZieNWi)
_ —2 .
ZjeN Wj
We chose a smaller percentage of weights for microarray-based data (1 versus
3% for data derived for networks) because the microarray datasets generally

contained measurement for more genes than the number of proteins in the
network.

P—value cutoff

Fig. 1. Empirical P-Values versus P-Value cutoffs reported for investigated enrichment methods. Methods with accurate statistics have their curves follow

the dotted line closely over the whole range. Each curve was constructed by aggregating the results of ~109 GO-based decoy term queries. Displayed on the
left (right) are results using weights derived from protein network information ﬂow simulations (microarrays). In microarray plots for SaddleSum. T-proﬁler
and GAGE. full lines indicate the results where negative weights were set to 0. while dashed lines show the results using all weights. The reason that HGEM
curves run below the theoretical line and parallel to it is that every curve is an aggregate of many curves. each of which (i) represents a single sample of

weights determining parameters to be fed into hypergeometric distribution. and (ii) is a step function touching the theoretical line and dropping below it.

Merging curves from many samples produces the effect seen in our plots.

2.8 mHG score

Instead of making a single. arbitrary choice of c and applying hypergeometric
score. mHG method implemented in the GOrilla package (Eden et (11.. 2009)
considers all possible c’s. The mHG score is deﬁned as

1 min(c,m) (oz) (no—J?)
mHG-121:2.  
where k is the number of entities annotated by the term M among the c
top-ranked entities. The exact P-Value for mHG score is then calculated
by using a dynamic programming algorithm developed by Eden et a1.
(2007). For our experiments. we used an implementation in C programming
language that was derived from the Java implementation used by GOrilla.
The implementation uses a truncated algorithm that gives an approximate
P-Value with improved running speed.

2.9 Retrieval stability with respect to choice of c

To evaluate consistency of investigated methods. we compared the sets of
signiﬁcant terms retrieved from GO using different numbers of non-zero
weights as input. For each w. we sort in descending order the weights
associated with entities. With each 0 selected. we kept 0 largest weights
unchanged and set the remaining to O to arrive at a modiﬁed set of weights
wlC. We did not totally exclude the lower weights but kept them under
consideration to provide statistical background. We submitted w|C for
analysis and obtained from each statistical method a set of enriched terms
ordered by their P-Value. In Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S3. we
displayed the actual ﬁve most signiﬁcant terms retrieved with their P-Values
for selected examples of weight sets. To investigate on a larger scale the
retrieval stability to 0 changes. we computed for each method the overlap
between sets of top 10 terms from two different Us for the w sets mentioned
in ‘Evaluating accuracy of P-Values’ and then took the average (Fig. 2B).

3 RESULTS

We compared our SaddleSum approach against the following
existing methods: Fisher’s exact test (HGEM; Boyle et (11., 2004),
two sample Student’s t-test with equal (T-proﬁler; Boorsma et (11.,
2005) and unequal (GAGE; Luo et (11., 2009) variances, and mHG

score (Eden et (11., 2007, 2009). Based on data from both microarrays
and simulations of information ﬂow in protein networks, the
comparison shown here encompassed (in order of importance)
evaluation of P-value accuracy, ranking stability and running time.
Accurate P-value reﬂects the likelihood of a false identiﬁcation and
thus allows for comparison between terms retrieved even across
experiments. Incorrect P-values therefore render ranking stability
and algorithmic speed pointless. Accurate P-values without ranking
stability question the robustness of biological interpretation. For
pragmatic use of an enrichment method, even with accurate statistics
and stability, it is still important to have reasonable speed.

3.1 Accuracy of reported P-values

The term P-value reported by an enrichment analysis method
provides the likelihood for that term to be enriched within w. To infer
biological signiﬁcance using statistical analysis, it is essential to
have accurate P-values. We analyzed the accuracy of P-values
reported by the investigated approaches through simulating ~109
queries and comparing their reported and empirical P-values.

Results based on querying databases with ﬁxed term sizes are
shown in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2. Shown in Figure 1 are
the results for querying GO-based gene-shufﬂed term databases,
which retain the structure of the original GO as a mixture of
terms of different sizes organized as a directed acyclic graph
where small terms are included in larger ones. The curves for all
methods in Figure 1, therefore, resemble a mixture of curves from
Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 albeit weighted toward smaller
sized terms.

For weights from both network simulations and microarrays,
SaddleSum as well as the methods based on Fisher’s exact test
(HGEM and mHG) report P-values that are acceptable (within
one order of magnitude from the theoretical values). For HGEM
and mHG, this is not surprising because our experiments involved
shufﬂing entity labels and hence followed the null model of the
hypergeometric distribution. On the other hand, the null model

Robust and accurate data enrichment statistics

 

of SaddleSum and the t-test methods assume weights drawn
independently from some distribution (sampling with replacement).
For terms with few entities (m f 100), the difference between the two
null models is minimal and the P-value accuracy assessment curves
for SaddleSum run as close to the theoretical line as those for HGEM
methods. Form > 100, SaddleSum gives more conservative P-values
for terms with large sums of weights (Supplementary Figs S1
and S2). In practice, this has no signiﬁcant effect to biological
inference. Large terms would be still selected as signiﬁcant given
a reasonable P-value cutoff and accurate P-values are assigned to
small terms that are biologically speciﬁc.

Two-sample t-test with unequal variances as used by GAGE
package reports P-values so conservative that they are often larger
than 0.01 and hence not always visible in our accuracy plots. This
effect persists even for m as large as 500. This might be because
the number of degrees of freedom used is considerably small. In
addition, its test statistic [Equation (5)] emphasizes the estimated

within-term variance SM that is typically larger than the overall

variance s2 .

On the other hand, T-proﬁler generally exaggerates (Luo et (11.,
2009) signiﬁcance because it uses the t-distribution with a large
number of degrees of freedom (n—2). Although some small terms
may appear biologically relevant (as in Fig.2), one should not
equate these exaggerated P-values with sensitivity. For microarray
data, the log ratios are almost symmetrically distributed about
0 (Supplementary Fig. S4). The distribution of their sum is close
to Gaussian. However, T-proﬁler still signiﬁcantly exaggerates
P-values for terms whose m<25 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
statistical accuracy of T-proﬁler worsens when negative log2 ratios
are set to 0. The reason for doing so is that allowing weights
within each term to cancel each other may not be biologically
appropriate. GO terms may cover a very general category where
annotations may not always be available for more speciﬁc subterms.
Subsequently, terms may get reﬁned and new terms may emerge.
In such situation, it is desirable to discover terms that have genes
that are signiﬁcantly upregulated even if many genes from the same
term are downregulated.

3.2 Stability

P-value accuracy, although the most important criterion, measures
only performance with respect to non-signiﬁcant hits, that is, the
likelihood of a false positive. It is also necessary to consider the
quality of enrichment results in terms of the underlying biology.
Testing the quality directly, as described in the introduction, is not yet
feasible. Instead, we evaluated internal consistency of each method
with respect to the number of top-ranked entities used for analysis.
Figure 2A shows the change of P-values reported for the top ﬁve
GO terms with respect to the number of selected entities using two
examples with weights, respectively, from network ﬂow simulation
and microarray. Additional examples are shown in Supplementary
Figure S3. Results from evaluating the overall consistency of the
best 10 terms retrieved are shown in Figure 2B.

Both HGEM and mHG methods are highly sensitive to the choice
of c, the number of entities deemed signiﬁcant. With a small c,
their sets of signiﬁcant terms resemble the top terms obtained by
SaddleSum, while large values of c render very small P-values for
large-sized terms (often biologically non-speciﬁc). This is mainly
because HGEM and mHG treat all selected signiﬁcant entities as

We queried GO 10 times with each of the ﬁve examined enrichment methods using
weights from 100 network simulation results and 136 microarrays (same datasets used
for P-value accuracy experiments). Running times for P-value calculations on dual-core

over all samples are shown on the left, while average times per query are shown on the
right. The HGEM method used IOU-object cutoff.

equally important without weighting down less signiﬁcant entities,
the collection of which may out vote the most signiﬁcant ones.
Hence, although mHG considers all possible c values, to obtain
biologically speciﬁc interpretation, it might be necessary to either
remove very large terms from the vocabulary or to impose an upper
bound on c. In that respect, mHG is very similar to the original
GSEA method (Mootha et (11., 2003), which also ignored weights.
The authors of GSEA noted that the genes ranked in middle of
the list had disproportionate effect to their results and produced an
improved version of GSEA (Subramanian et (11., 2005) with weights
considered.

GAGE does not show strong consistency because many P-values
it reports are too conservative and fall above the 0.01 threshold
we used. Consequently, the best overlap between various cutoffs is
about 5 (out of 10) for network ﬂow examples and 4 for microarray
examples (Fig. 2B). T-proﬁler shows great internal consistency.
Unfortunately, as shown in Figure 1, Supplementary Figures S1 and
S2, it reports inaccurate P-values, especially for small terms. This is
illustrated in the top panel of Figure 2A, where T-proﬁler selects as
highly signiﬁcant the small terms (with 5, 6 and 9 entities), which are
deemed insigniﬁcant by all other methods. The same pattern can be
observed in Supplementary Figure S3, although the severity is tamed
for microarrays. Using weights for scoring terms, SaddleSum is also
stable with respect to the choice of c but with accurate statistics.

3.3 Speed

In terms of algorithmic running time (Table 1), parametric
methods relying on normal or Student’s t-distribution require few
computations. Methods based on hypergeometric distribution, if
properly implemented, are also fast. On the other hand, non-
parametric methods can take signiﬁcant time if many shufﬂings are
performed. Based on dynamic programming, mHG method can also
take excessive time for large terms. SaddleSum has running time
that is only slightly longer than that of parametric methods.

4 DISCUSSION

Approximating the distribution of sum of weights by saddlepoint
method, our SaddleSum is able to adapt itself equally well to

distributions with widely different properties. The reported P-values
have accuracy comparable with that of the methods based on the
hypergeometric distribution, while requiring no prior selection of
the number of signiﬁcant entities.

While our results show that GAGE method suffers from reduced
sensitivity, it should be noted that it forms only a part of
GAGE algorithm. GAGE was designed to compare two groups
of microarrays (e.g. disease and control) by obtaining an overall
P-value. In that scheme, the P-values we evaluated are used only
for one-on-one comparisons between members of two groups. By
combining one-on-one P-values (which are assumed independent),
the overall P-value obtained by GAGE can become quite small.

The assumed null distribution by T-proﬁler (Boorsma et (11., 2005)
is close to Gaussian. It has been commented (Luo et (11., 2009) that
its statistics are similar to that of PAGE (Kim and Volsky, 2005),
which uses Z-test. Naturally, the smallest, and likely exaggerated,
P-values occur when evaluating small terms. For that reason, PAGE
does not consider terms with less than 10 entities, which we included
in our evaluation solely for the purpose of comparison.

Our network simulation experiments produce very different
weight proﬁles (Supplementary Fig. S4) than that of microarrays.
These weights are always positive and skewedly distributed. Even
after summing many such weights, the distribution of the sum is still
far from Gaussian in the tail. Therefore, T-proﬁler and GAGE are
unable to give accurate statistics. Overall, our evaluations clearly
illustrate the inadequacy, even for large terms, of assuming nearly
Gaussian null distribution when the data are skewed. While Central
Limit Theorem does guarantee convergence to Gaussian for large
m, the convergence may not be sufﬁciently fast in the tail regions,
which inﬂuence the statistical accuracy the most.

As presented here, SaddleSum uses given w both for estimating
the m-dependent score distribution and for scoring each term. If a
certain distribution of weights are prescribed, it is possible to adapt
our algorithm to take a histogram for that distribution as input and
use experimentally obtained weights for scoring only.

A possible way to improve biological relevance in retrieval is
to allow for term-speciﬁc weight assignment. For example, a gene
associated with a GO term can be assigned a ‘NOT’ qualiﬁer to
indicate explicitly that this gene product is not associated with the
term considered. A way to use this information would be to change
the sign of the weight for such a gene (from positive to negative
or vice versa), but only when scoring the terms where the qualiﬁer
applies. Hence, potentially every term could be associated with a
speciﬁc weight distribution. While all methods using weights can
implement this scheme, SaddleSum is particularly suitable for it
because it handles well the small terms and skewed distributions,
where changing the sign for a single weight can have a considerable
effect. This procedure can be generalized so that each gene in a term
carries a different weight.

Several authors (Goeman and Biihlmann, 2007; Gold et (11.,
2007; Huang et (11., 2009) have raised the issue of correlation
between weights of entities: generally the weights of biologically
related genes or proteins change together and therefore a null model
assuming independence between weights may result in exaggerated
P-values. In principle, a good null model is one that can bring
out the difference between signal and noise. To what level of
sophistication a null model should be usually is a trade-off between
statistical accuracy and retrieval sensitivity. Using protein sequence
comparison, for example, ungapped alignment enjoys a theoretically

characterizable statistics (Karlin and Altschul, 1990) but is not as
sensitive as the gapped alignment (Altschul et (11., 1997), where the
score statistics is known only empirically because the null model
allows for insertions and deletions of amino acids. Incorporating
insertion and deletion into the null model made all the difference in
retrieval sensitivity. This is probably because insertions/deletions
do occur abundantly in natural evolution of protein sequences.
The ignorance of protein sequence correlations, assumed by both
ungapped and gapped alignments, does not seem to cause much
harm in retrieval efﬁcacy.

Although SaddleSum assumes weight independence and thus
bears the possibility of exaggerating statistical signiﬁcance of an
identiﬁed term, it mitigates this issue by incorporating the entire w
in the null distribution. It includes the entities with extreme weights
that clearly represent ‘signal’ and not ‘noise’, bringing higher the tail
of the score distribution and thus larger P-values. Indeed, as shown
by examples in Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S3, SaddleSum
does not show unreasonably small P-values. It should also be noted
that SaddleSum is designed for the simple case where a summary
value is available for each entity considered—its use for analyzing
complex microarray experiments with many subjects divided into
several groups is beyond the scope of this article and care must be
exercised when using it in this context.

SaddleSum is a versatile enrichment analysis method.
Researchers are free to process appropriately their experimental
data, produce a suitable w as input, and receive accurate term
statistics from SaddleSum. Since it does not make many assumptions
about the distribution of data, we foresee a number of additional
applications not limited to genomics or proteomics, for example, to
literature searches.

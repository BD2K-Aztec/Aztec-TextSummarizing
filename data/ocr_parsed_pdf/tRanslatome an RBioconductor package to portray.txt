ABSTRACT

Summary: High-throughput technologies have led to an explosion of
genomic data available for automated analysis. The consequent pos-
sibility to simultaneously sample multiple layers of variation along the
gene expression flow requires computational methods integrating raw
information from different ‘-omics’. It has been recently demonstrated
that translational control is a widespread phenomenon, with profound
and still underestimated regulation capabilities. Although detecting
changes in the levels of total messenger RNAs (mRNAs; the transcrip-
tome), of polysomally loaded mRNAs (the translatome) and of proteins
(the proteome) is experimentally feasible in a high-throughput way, the
integration of these levels is still far from being robustly approached.
Here we introduce tRanslatome, a new R/Bioconductor package,
which is a complete platform for the simultaneous pairwise analysis
of transcriptome, translatome and proteome data. The package in-
cludes most of the available statistical methods developed for the
analysis of high-throughput data, allowing the parallel comparison of
differentially expressed genes and the corresponding differentially en-
riched biological themes. Notably, it also enables the prediction of
translational regulatory elements on mRNA sequences. The utility of
this tool is demonstrated with two case studies.

Availability and implementation: tRanslatome is available in
Bioconductor.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput (‘-omics’) measurements of macromolecule
variations in the cell offer the possibility to comprehensively
understand how the cellular processes are regulated and to
reveal how different layers of control are coordinated in produ-
cing a physiologically coherent response. These measurements
are also invaluable to understand how the loss of this coordin-
ation contributes to disease origin. The establishment of high-

throughput technologies and the consequent explosion of avail-
able data allow us to reach a ‘systems’ understanding of the
variations in gene expression only when a parallel evolution of
algorithms and data mining techniques is achieved. This eventu-
ally enables to suggest and prioritize potential mechanistic
processes. Nonetheless, the integration of ‘-omics’ data, ranging
from epigenetic chromatin remodeling to the dynamics of tran-
scription, translation and protein activities, still requires consid-
erable experimental and computational developments.

In this context, the low correlation observed between messen-
ger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels is an unsolved issue (V ogel
and Marcotte, 2012). Recently we showed that the analysis of the
translatome, an intermediate level between the transcriptome and
the proteome formed by mRNAs engaged with polysomes, pro-
vides substantial and somewhat surprising new information
(Tebaldi et al., 2012). This and other examples (Colman et al.,
2013; Schwanhausser et al., 2011; Vogel et al., 2010) show how
the integration of ‘-omics’ data can provide a biologically rele-
vant outcome.

Here we present tRanslatome, a new Bioconductor package
for the analysis of differential proﬁles coming from transcrip-
tome, translatome and proteome studies. tRanslatome will help
to study mRNA and protein variations in an exhaustive way,
providing speciﬁc tools for the comparison of polysomal mRNA
with total mRNA or protein data.

2 DESCRIPTION AND USAGE

tRanslatome is a complete platform for the analysis and pairwise
comparison of two ‘-omics’ levels implemented as a
Bioconductor package. It is developed to compare translatome
data with transcriptome and/or proteome data. A general
overview of the functions offered by tRanslatome is given in
Figure 1A. The package is conceptually organized in three mod-
ules, described as follows:

2.1 DEGs detection

The only input required by tRanslatome is an expression matrix
containing either read counts (from next-generation sequencing
data) or normalized signals (from microarray or proteome
experiments). To select differentially expressed genes (DEGs),
the package offers, in the same computational environment,
the integrative analysis of established and emerging statistical
methods: (i) DEseq (Anders and Huber, 2010) and edgeR

Fig. 1. Outline of tRanslatome workﬂow and graphical outputs. (A) General overview of the three modules provided by tRanslatome. (B) Scatterplot of
fold changes. Each gene is mapped according to the fold change in the transcriptome and the translatome. Different classes of DEGs are color labeled.
The Spearman correlation coefﬁcients are displayed for all genes and for all DEGs. (C) Radar plot of the top enriched GO biological process terms for
the transcriptome and the tran slatome DEGs. (D) Heatmap of the top enriched post-transcriptional regulators for the transcriptome and the translatome
DEGs. The color scale is based on the -log10 of the enrichment P-value, calculated with a Fisher test

(Robinson et al., 2010), speciﬁcally implemented for the analysis
of next-generation sequencing data; (ii) significance analysis of
microarrays (SAM) (Tusher et al., 2001), developed for the ana-
lysis of microarray data; (iii) t—test, RankProd (Breitling et al.,
2004), linear models and moderated t—test (Smyth, 2004), suitable
to deal with general quantitative data; and (iv) methods dealing
speciﬁcally with the comparison of translatome and transcrip-
tome data, e. g. ANOTA (Larsson et al., 2011) and translational
efﬁciency, derived from the ratio of polysomal and subpolysomal
signals (Powley et al., 2009) or the ratio of ribosome protected
fragments and RNA-seq reads (Ingolia et al., 2011). These tech-
niques are described more exhaustively in the documentation and
in the Supplementary Material.

To study all the relevant differences arising from the two
‘-omics’ levels, tRanslatome offers a variety of graphical outputs,
helping the quality assessment and interpretation of the results.
The minus-average plots aid the identiﬁcation of intensity-de-
pendent patterns, whereas the standard deviation plot can help
the selection of the best method for DEGs identiﬁcation (see
Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). The graphics also include scatter-
plots, displaying changes in the expression of genes in terms of
fold changes at both levels (Fig. 1B), and histograms, showing a
detailed representation of all the DEGs classes (Supplementary
Figs 2 and 3).

2.2 Gene Ontology enrichment comparison

One of the most frequent applications of the Gene Ontology
(G0) is enrichment analysis, i.e. the identiﬁcation of signiﬁcantly

overrepresented GO terms in a given gene set (Ashburner et al.,
2000). tRanslatome includes the detection and comparison of
GO terms, resuming information about cellular components,
molecular functions and biological processes associated to
DEGs detected from the two ‘-omics’ levels. Multiple choices
are offered for the overrepresentation test, which exploits the
GO ‘tree’ structure by means of the Bioconductor package
‘topGO’: these choices can satisfy the need for either more gen-
eral or more speciﬁc biological themes. To simplify the inspec-
tion of the results and to effectively represent the differences in
the enrichment of ontological terms, the corresponding radar
plots and heatmaps can be produced (Fig. 1C and Supplemen-
tary Figs 7 and 8). tRanslatome also provides methods for a
sensitive comparison of the similarity between enriched GO
terms, including the semantic similarity scores (Wang et al.,
2007) between terms at each level, and the global similarity
score between the two levels.

2.3 Enrichment analysis of post-transcriptional regulatory
elements

As tRanslatome focuses on the study of global translational con-
trols, enrichment analysis of RNA binding proteins and
microRNA binding sites or other RNA regulatory motifs (e.g.
AU—rich elements) can be performed on the lists of DEGs. This
analysis allows the user to identify possible regulatory factors
responsible for the translational regulation of genes in the experi-
ment under consideration (Fig. 1D). The list of genes regulated
by each post-transcriptional element is obtained from the

recently established Atlas of UTR Regulatory Activity (AURA)
database (Dassi et al., 2012). The method computes a Fisher test
P-Value indicating whether binding sites for each regulator are
significantly enriched in the DEGs lists. The annotations from
AURA will be updated on every release of tRanslatome. Users
can also specify a custom annotation ﬁle in place of the one
provided by default.

3 EXAMPLES

A worked example, derived from data on differentiated versus
undifferentiated human hepatocytes (Parent et al., 2007) is used
to generate the panels contained in Figure 1. Detailed explan-
ations of this example, along with a second example dealing with
the comparison of the proteome and the transcriptome between
two human cell lines (Stevens and Brown, 2013), are provided in
the Supplementary Material.

4 CONCLUSION

tRanslatome allows a user-friendly comparison and integration
of data generated from two ‘-omics’ measurements, empowering
the discovery of regulatory mechanisms underlying the uncou-
pling processes among the transcriptome, the translatome and
the proteome.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The Mirrortree server allows to graphically and
interactively study the co-evolution of two protein families, and
investigate their possible interactions and functional relationships in
a taxonomic context. The server includes the possibility of starting
from single sequences and hence it can be used by non-expert users.
Availability and Implementation: The web server is freely available
at http://csbg.cnb.csic.es/mtserver. It was tested in the main web
browsers. Adobe Flash Player is required at the client side to perform
the interactive assessment of co-evolution.

1 INTRODUCTION

A lot of biological knowledge is hidden in the complex networks of
relationships of different nature between molecular entities. In the
case of proteins, their biological roles can only be ﬁilly understood
in the context of their interaction with others. This importance
in deciphering as much as possible of the complex network
of interactions and functional relationships between proteins has
led to the development of speciﬁc experimental (Shoemaker and
Panchenko, 2007a) and computational (Shoemaker and Panchenko,
2007b) techniques for this task. One family of these computational
techniques is based on the observed relationship between protein
interactions and co-evolution [similarity of evolutionary histories as
represented by phylogenetic trees; see Pazos and Valencia (2008)
and references herein]. This approach, termed mirrortree, has been
applied not only to look for interaction partners in large datasets
of proteins (e.g. Juan et al., 2008), but also to study in depth
the co-evolution and interactions in particular pairs of protein
families (e.g. Dou et al., 2006; Labedan et al., 2004; McPartland
et (11., 2007). Many authors developed variations and different
implementations of this approach [e.g. see references in Pazos and
Valencia (2008)], but none of them are intended to be operated by
non-experts users. They are either very speciﬁc for certain needs or
are distributed as non-interactive command-line programs or require
a complex preparation of the input data (e.g. generation of the
multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and/or phylogenetic trees).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

This precludes these techniques from being used by most molecular
biologists.

In this work, we present the Mirrortree server, an automatic system
for the interactive assessment of co-evolutionary features between
two protein families. The system only requires as input the sequence
of a single representative of each family to start, which allows it to
be used by non-bioinformaticians. All the subsequent steps (search
for homologues, localization of orthologues, generation and ﬁltering
of MSAs and trees, and tree comparison) are fully automatic.
Nevertheless, expert users have the possibility of providing their
(manually curated) MSAs or trees. Moreover, the tree comparison
is done in an interactive interface that allows users to study in depth
the co-evolution of their families and investigate their interactions
in a taxonomic context.

2 WORKFLOW

Supplementary Material 1 contains an exhaustive description of the
server workﬂow. What follows is a short description. Each one of the
two input sequences is BLASTed (Altschul et (11., 1997) against the
Integr8 database of fully sequenced genomes (Kersey et al., 2005).
The list of putative homologues is ﬁltered to discard fragments,
divergent sequences, etc. The remaining sequences are aligned with
Muscle (Edgar, 2004). The resulting MSA is ﬁltered again (see
Supplementary Material 1 for details) and only one homologue per
species is retained as the putative orthologue (the one with highest
similarity to the master). The ﬁnal MSA of putative orthologues is
used to construct a phylogenetic tree with the ‘neighbour-joining’
(NJ) algorithm implemented in ClustalW (Chenna et al., 2003).
Expert users can bypass these steps by providing their own MSAs or
phylogenetic trees (i.e. generated with more sophisticated techniques
than NJ). The computationally expensive steps are delegated to
a computer cluster. As an example, running the whole process
for two families of around 800 residues long with 120 species in
common takes 10 min.

3 INTERFACE

When the process is completed, the user receives an e-mail
containing a link to the interactive Flash-based visualization of
the trees of the two families (Fig. l), as well as ﬁles with useful
intermediate results (MSAs and trees for the two families, static
graphical representations of the mirroring trees, etc). Organisms
present in both families are connected by lines in this representation.
Tree branches can be swapped in order to confront matching clades
between the two trees and obtain a better representation. The tree

representation can be zoomed and the user can select different
proteins (leaves) or whole clades (internal nodes) in both trees in
order to restrict the calculation of tree similarity to certain groups of
organisms. Panels with additional tools and information are arranged
on the top of this representation and can be shown/hidden and freely
moved/resized in a windows-based interface (Fig. 1). One of these
panels shows the similarity of the trees as calculated by mirrortree
in a colour scale. The tree similarity for the current selection is
also shown in this panel. Another panel shows information available
for the selected proteins (leaves) in the Uniprot resource (Uniprot
Consortium, 2009), such as protein name, sequence, organism and
reported interactions. Organism selection can also be done by
taxonomic criteria using the included taxonomy browser (Fig. l),
i.e. to evaluate the co-evolution in a certain kingdom or family.
Selections in the tree are also shown in the taxonomy browser.
The sub-alignment for the sequences in the current selection can
be exported for ﬁirther analysis. Finally a plot with a simpliﬁed
representation of the correlation between the inter-protein distances
in both families is also shown. This plot can show all the distances
or only the ones involving the selected organisms. This plot is very
useﬁil to detect outliers: Clouds of points far from the diagonal
representing non-correlated distances that decrease the overall
similarity of the trees. In many cases, these are related to non-
standard evolutionary events such as horizontal gene transfer (Pazos
et (11., 2005). Selections of points in this plot cause the corresponding
organisms/clades in the trees to be selected. The server has many
other features extensively explained in a help ﬁle. There is also
a guided tutorial for illustrating the kind of studies that can be
performed with the server.

4 CONCLUSION

The Mirrortree server is the ﬁrst system for interactively assessing
the co-evolution between two protein families in order to evaluate

their possible interactions in a taxonomic framework. There are
related systems such as TSEMA (Izarzugaza et (11., 2008) which,
based on the same relationship between protein interactions and
tree similarity, are nevertheless intended for predicting the mapping
(connections between the leaves) between two families already
known to interact. Moreover, that server does not include the
possibility of automatically generating MSAs and hence it is more
difﬁcult to be used by non-experts.

An important requirement for a computational tool to be used
by biologists is simplicity. That left most existing tools for studying
co-evolution and predicting protein interactions out of their standard
toolkit. The Mirrortree server was developed with the goal of being
amenable to be used by non-experts, in such a way that any user
can interactively study the co-evolution between his/her families of
interest in a taxonomic context starting with single sequences.

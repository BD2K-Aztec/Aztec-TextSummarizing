ABSTRACT

Motivation: The recently released lnfinium HumanMethylation450
array (the ‘450k’ array) provides a high-throughput assay to quantify
DNA methylation (DNAm) at ~450 000 loci across a range of genomic
features. Although less comprehensive than high-throughput sequen-
cing-based techniques, this product is more cost-effective and
promises to be the most widely used DNAm high-throughput meas-
urement technology over the next several years.

Results: Here we describe a suite of computational tools that incorp-
orate state-of-the-art statistical techniques for the analysis of DNAm
data. The software is structured to easily adapt to future versions of
the technology. We include methods for preprocessing, quality as-
sessment and detection of differentially methylated regions from the
kilobase to the megabase scale. We show how our software provides
a powerful and flexible development platform for future methods. We
also illustrate how our methods empower the technology to make
discoveries previously thought to be possible only with sequencing-
based methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA methylation (DNAm) is a chemical modiﬁcation of DNA
that plays a key role in regulating gene expression. Epigenetic
mechanisms, including DNAm, allow a single genome to give
rise to hundreds of phenotypically diverse cell types. In addition

to its importance in normal development, DNAm is thought to
play an important role in diseases when dysregulated.

Chemically, DNAm involves the addition of a methyl group to
a cytosine base (C), forming methylcytosine. In adult mamma-
lian cells, this modification occurs almost exclusively at Cs
immediately followed by a G in the 5/73/ direction, denoted by
CpG. Cst are depleted in mammalian genomes and those that
remain tend to cluster in regions termed CpG islands
(Gardiner-Garden and Frommer, 1987) that are enriched near
gene promoters.

The health implications of deciphering the DNAm code have
recently received much attention (Dawson and Kouzarides, 2012;
Feinberg, 2007). DNAm is best understood in the context of
cancer biology, where it is clear that aberrant gains and losses
of DNAm almost universally accompany the initiation and pro-
gression of tumors (Feinberg and Tycko, 2004). Much of the
excitement surrounding epigenetics relates to the promise of
therapies that reverse disease-associated epigenetic alterations,
thereby activating or silencing aberrantly expressed disease-
related genes.

As a result of DNAm’s role in developmental and disease
biology, there is great interest in measuring DNAm at a compre-
hensive genomic scale. Although next-generation sequencing
technologies offer several promising new approaches (Krueger
et al., 2012), currently, Illumina Inﬁnium arrays are the most
widely used technology for this purpose. For example, The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project is using this array and
has already processed >6000 samples (as of September 30, 2013)
and made the data publicly available (http://cancergenome.nih.
gov/). Furthermore, large cohort studies are becoming interested
in measuring methylation and are expected to use cost-effective
arrays with some studies already published (Rakyan et al., 2011).

This work introduces a software development framework for
the analysis of Illumina Inﬁnium methylation arrays. Although
the design is general, the current version of our software focuses
on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead array (the
‘450k’ array), their most recent product. This array has been
extensively described (Bibikova et al., 2011), but we include a

short description here for completeness. The two-color array in-
terrogates the methylation status of 485512 methylation loci
(mostly CpG sites, but a small number of cytosines outside of
the CpG context are also present), using bisulﬁte-converted
DNA. For each methylation locus, two signals of interest are
recorded. One signal measures the amount of methylated DNA
(Meth), and the other signal measures the amount of unmethy-
lated DNA (Unmeth). In principle, the proportion Meth/
(Unmeth+Meth) is the methylation ratio (referred to as beta
value by Illumina’s software) in the population of cells from
which we extract DNA. The methylation ratio, or its logit trans-
form, is the quantity used in downstream analysis. In the
scientiﬁc literature related to the 450k platform, logit-
transformed beta values are referred to as M-Values.

The Meth and Unmeth signals do not relate to the green and
red channels in a straightforward way. The 450k platform
includes two different methylation assay designs, referred to as
Inﬁnium I and Inﬁnium II, or type I and type II. Each methy-
lation locus is interrogated by one of these designs. For a type I
locus, the Meth and Unmeth signals are measured by two paired
probes, with a given locus using either the red or green signal
from these probes. Type II loci are assayed using a single probe,
with Meth and Unmeth signals derived from the green and red
channels, respectively. In addition to the methylation loci, the
array contains a small number of control probes and 65 probes
measuring common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in-
tended for sample tracking.

The reasoning behind using two different probe designs is
simple, but illuminating for potential developers. Type II
probes use only one probe per methylation locus and hence
allow more loci on the array, at a fixed array size. However,
owing to the chemistry used by the type II probe design, type
II probes can only tolerate up to three Cst within the 50—bp
probe. The type I design tolerates more Cst within the 50—bp
probe, but assumes that all methylation loci in the probed
sequence are in the same state, i.e. the probe measuring Meth
assumes all Cst within the probed sequence to be methylated,
and the probe measuring Unmeth assumes all Cst in the
probed sequence are unmethylated. The ability to tolerate
more Cst in the probe allows type I probes to be used in
regions of high CpG density, such as CpG islands (CGI).

Until recently, studies of DNAm have focused largely on CGI.
For example, the Illumina products that preceded the 450k
included the widely used Infinium 27k array exclusively targeted
CGI, primarily at gene promoters. However, Irizarry et a].
(2008), using a noniCGI-centric array design, referred to as com-
prehensive arrays for relative methylation (CHARM), demon-
strated that greater variability is present in regions outside
CGI and coined the term ‘CGI shores’ for regions within 2kb
of CGI. The 450k array design includes a set of regions identiﬁed
as tissue- or cancer-speciﬁc using CHARM data, including CGIs
and CGI shores, as well as probes in other regions, which
Illumina refers to as shelf and open sea (Table 1).

Here we present a software suite containing an assortment of
new functionality for the analysis of this array, but also contain-
ing an infrastructure useful as a development platform for the
research community. We note that Subset-quantile Within Array
Normalization (SWAN) (Maksimovic et al., 2012), one of the
ﬁrst alternative preprocessing methods, was developed by

another group using our infrastructure. Among the tools de-
veloped by our group, we speciﬁcally describe bump hunting
(Jaffe et al., 2012) and block ﬁnding (Hansen et al., 2011) cap-
abilities. Although current data analyses for these arrays have
relied on single probe analysis (Marabita et al., 2013; Pidsley
et al., 2013; Touleimat and Tost, 2012; Wessely and Emes,
2012), we have previously pointed out the advantages of borrow-
ing strength across neighboring loci (Aryee et al., 2011; Doi et al.,
2009; Jaffe et al., 2012). Furthermore, a recent ﬁnding related to
cancer was the observation of large genomic [1&1000 kb] hypo-
methylated blocks (Hansen et al., 2011). We introduce an ap-
proach that permits the discovery of hypo- and hypermethylated
blocks with 450k data. We illustrate the advantages of our soft-
ware with publicly available data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Annotation

Meaningful analysis of 450k data depends on annotating probes with
genomic location and their relationship to islands, genes and other gen-
omic features. Although probe sequence is ﬁxed as part of the array
design, annotation can change for a number of reasons, such as a
change of the human genome build. For this reason, our software pack-
age separates data from annotation and annotation from array design. By
annotation we mean how methylation loci are associated with genomic
locations and nearby features. By design we mean how probes on the
array are matched with relevant color channels to produce the Meth and
Unmeth signals. At the time of writing, the annotation information was
stored in a separate Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004) package
IliuminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19, and the array design
was stored in IliuminaHumanMethylation450kmany’est. The annotation
package will change, but we will use careful version control such that
any given analysis can be reproducible.

We also maintain independence by deﬁning two types of data classes
for the experimental data: one stores data independently of annotation
and the other includes genomic annotation. The two types of classes are
distinguished by the presence or absence of the word Genomic in their
class name as explained in detail in the next section.

2.2 Representing methylation data in R

To enable ﬂexible development of preprocessing and analysis methods,
we operate with a number of different representations of the array data
through S4 classes (Chambers, 1998). Our software starts with .idat ﬁles,
a binary format containing the raw red and green channel intensities. The
‘RGChannelSet’ class organizes these data into an object for which

several useful accessor methods are available. Once these data are pro-
cessed into methylation measurements, they can be stored in four add-
itional classes representing several stages of preprocessed data:
‘MethylSet’, ‘GenomicMethylSet’, ‘RatioSet’ and ‘GenomicRatioSet’.
The ‘Genomic’ preﬁx in the class name indicates that methylation loci
have been associated with a genomic location. This is a nonreversible
transformation, as it entails choosing a reference genome and discards
unmapped probes. The operation is achieved by the function
‘mapToGenome’, which permits the user to choose a human genome
build. The MethylSet and GenomicMethylSet classes directly represent
the Meth and Unmeth measurements and are useful for preprocessing
routines delivering ﬁnal measurements in these channels, such as the nor-
malization routines currently included with Illumina’s GenomeStudio
Software. The RatioSet and GenomicRatioSet classes represent the
data as methylation ratios (beta values) or M-values (log ratios of beta
values). Both classes include the option of including a copy number meas-
urement [e.g. CN=log2(Meth+Unmeth)]. The ratioConvert function
converts MethylSet to RatioSet and GenomicMethylSet to
GenomicRatioSet. This design provides a ﬂexible framework for method
development and analyses. The natural starting point for analysis is usu-
ally the GenomicRatioSet class.

Note that although our software makes it particularly easy to import
raw data from the primary .idat ﬁles, it is also possible to import pro-
cessed data exported from GenomeStudio (Illumina’s default software),
which is often encountered in public data repositories. These data can
also be conveniently stored in GenomicRatioSet objects.

2.3 Preprocessing/normalization

Preprocessing raw microarray intensities into usable methylation meas-
urements is an important step in data analysis (Triche et al., 2013).
Several successful techniques have been developed for gene expression
arrays, with quantile normalization being one of the most popular tech-
niques (Bolstad et al., 2003). Illumina developed a new procedure that did
not take full advantage of these previous developments (our software
includes preprocessIllumina: an implementation of this procedure that
can be applied to RGChannelSets). Several groups have found that this
procedure can be improved upon by borrowing ideas from normalization
techniques developed for expression arrays (Maksimovic et al., 2012;
Pidsley et al., 2013; Teschendorff et al., 2013; Touleimat and Tost,
2012; Triche et al., 2013). However, quantile normalization was not
used in part because these groups noticed that the empirical distributions
of typeI and type II were different (Fig. 1). We implemented a version of
subset quantile normalization (Wu and Aryee, 2010) that takes into ac-
count this characteristic. This normalization procedure is essentially simi-
lar to the one previously presented (Touleimat and Tost, 2012), but has
been independently reimplemented owing to the present lack of a released
supported version. We apply our procedure to the Meth and Unmeth
intensities separately. We force the distribution of type I and type II to be
the same by ﬁrst quantile normalizing the type II probes across samples
and then interpolating a reference distribution to which we normalize the
type I probes. Because probe types and probe regions are confounded
(Table 1) and we know that DNAm distributions vary across regions
(Fig. 1), we stratify the probes by region before applying this interpol-
ation. For the probes on the X and Y chromosomes, we normalize males
and females separately. Sex is determined by the getSex function using
copy number information. The stratiﬁed quantile normalization method
is implemented by the preprocessQuantile function (the function does no
background correction and removes zeros using the ﬁxMethOutlier f unc-
tion). Note that this algorithm relies on the assumptions necessary for
quantile normalization to be applicable and thus is not recommended for
cases where global changes are expected, such as in cancerinormal com-
parisons. We also note that whereas most currently available methods
(e.g. Illumina, Beta MIxture Quantile dilation (BMIQ), SWAN) are

within-array procedures, our stratiﬁed quantile normalization procedure
involves both within- and between-sample normalization.

2.4 Quality assessment

Quality assessment is an important step in microarray analysis. Detecting
and removing low-quality samples that normalization cannot correct has
been shown to improve downstream results (McCall et al., 2011). As
larger datasets using the 450k array have become available, our ability
to detect low-quality samples has improved. Our infrastructure permits
the development of such statistical tools. We have found it useful to
inspect the median of the Meth and Unmeth signals for each array. We
demonstrate this feature in Section 3 using a publicly available dataset
composed of 100 arrays hybridized to DNA from whole blood.

2.5 Annotating probes affected by genetic variation

It has been noted that the manufacturer’s array design manifest contains
incomplete annotation of SNPs at probed sites and that these polymorph-
isms may affect DNAm measurements (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2013; Price
et al., 2013; Touleimat and Tost, 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Youseﬁ et al.,
2013; Zhi et al., 2013). Therefore, we have included a more comprehen-
sive SNP annotation in minfi. We obtained all common SNPs from
dbSNP137 (minor allele frequency>1%) within each 450k probe and
identiﬁed whether SNPs were at the single base extension site (position
0), at the proximal CpG on the probe (positions 172) or within the probe
body (positions 3750). Using this SNP annotation, which is available in
the package, users can decide the stringency of probe ﬁltering appropriate
for their analysis. We have developed scripts for this purpose, which are
included in minfi.

2.6 Bump hunting

Frequently, the goal of a study involving DNAm proﬁling is to identify
regions of contiguous Cst associated with a phenotype of interest. For
example, we may ﬁnd a CGI showing higher methylation levels in cancer
cells compared with normal controls. We have developed an approach for
identifying and attaching statistical uncertainty to such regions. These
methods are implemented in the bumphunter Bioconductor package.
The minﬁ package interfaces seamlessly with bumphunter and provides
a more robust method for detecting differentially methylated loci than the
standard approach of analyzing each CpG individually (Marabita et al.,
2013; Pidsley et al., 2013; Touleimat and Tost, 2012; Wessely and Emes,
2012). Many of the loci on the 450k array are clustered into regions
similar to those found on CHARM arrays, with 315420 being located

in CpG islands, shores, shelves and open sea regions are represented by
green, orange, purple and pink, respectively. (A) The boxes represent
locus groups, each of which is collapsed to a single mean methylation
value. We group loci within the same CGI, the same CGI shore or the
same CGI shelf, as well as adjacent open sea probes that are within
500 bp of each other. (B) The ﬁrst row of points shows the midpoints
of collapsed open sea clusters. These are grouped into long-range clusters
and used for block ﬁnding. The second row of points shows all collapsed
clusters across all region types with color representing region type

within 300 bp of another probed locus. The array includes 72611 such
clusters with the average region spanning 332 bp and containing an aver-
age of 4.3 loci. Therefore, we can apply the original bumphunter imple-
mentation as described in (Jaffe et al., 2012). To do this, the bumphunter
package includes the clusterMaker function, which, given a
maximum gap between probes, groups them into clusters. We perform
a probe-level regression and smooth the coefﬁcient of interest within
clusters to identify bumps along the genome. We demonstrate the advan-
tages of identifying regions in Section 3.

2.7 Block ﬁnding

Because bump hunting focuses on methylation changes on the scale of
gene promoters (172 kb), it is not designed to ﬁnd long-range alterations
such as the recently identiﬁed hypomethylated blocks (Berman et al.,
2012; Hansen et al., 2011). Blocks have, to date, only been detected
using whole-genome bisulﬁte sequencing because microarrays include
only select regions of the genome. However, we have developed a
method that uses ~170 000 open sea probes on the 450k to detect long-
range changes in the methylation status. To do this, we ﬁrst use the
cngollapse function to group adjacent open sea loci into clusters with
a default maximum gap of 500 bp and a maximum cluster width of
1500 bp (Fig. 2). The loci within each cluster are then averaged, resulting
in a single mean estimate per cluster. The resulting cluster centers are then
grouped into large regions (Fig. 2) in which the bump hunting procedure
is applied with a large (250 KB+) smoothing window. In Section 3, we
demonstrate that published hypomethylated blocks identiﬁed from
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data can be recovered with this ap-
proach. However, estimating the precise boundaries of these blocks is
constrained by the resolution of the array.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Preprocessing/normalization

To compare preprocessing algorithms, we hybridized the same
liver DNA and the same placenta DNA to 58 plates, giving us
124 technical replicates (69 liver and 55 placenta, GEO
GSE52731). We then preprocessed these data with Illumina’s

(A) For each locus, we compute the average and standard deviation
across liver technical samples. The resulting loess curve ﬁtted to the
standard deviation versus average scatterplot for each method is
shown. (B) Using the same samples, we compute the average difference
between liver and placenta (effect size) for each locus. We then plot the
resulting effect sizes for each preprocessing method against effect sizes
from the default Illumina procedure

default method, SWAN (Maksimovic et al., 2012), BMIQ
(Teschendorff et al., 2013), wateRmelon DASEN (Pidsley
et al., 2013) and our implementation of stratiﬁed quantile nor-
malization (preprocessQuantile) after dropping one low-quality
liver sample. To assess precision, we computed the standard de-
viation across the technical replicates for each probe. Because of
the known meanivariance relationship with these measurements,
we also computed the average methylation across probes.

We then computed a smoothed curve to summarize the scat-
terplot of standard deviations versus means for all probes
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S1) and for probes stratiﬁed
by region type (Supplementary Fig. S2). Most methods perform
similarly, although our preprocessQuantile procedure and
DASEN generally outperform other methods in terms of redu-
cing variability among technical replicates. We also performed
the analysis on the M-scale to conﬁrm that results were similar
(Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). To confirm that these gains in
precision were not due to reduced sensitivity, we compared the
across-replicate average difference between liver and placenta
(Fig. 3BrE). We also observed that our procedure makes type
I and type II loci comparable (Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.2 Quality assessment

We read and processed the raw data from 100 randomly selected
individuals from a DNAm study of aging (Hannum et al., 2012)
such that men, women, Caucasians and Hispanics were equally
represented. We processed these data with the Illumina default
procedure. Principal component analysis and multidimensional
scaling plots are useful for exploring distances between samples
(Leek et al., 2010). A multidimensional scaling plot of the methy-
lation values reveals (not surprisingly) that sex is the biggest
source of variability (Fig. 4A). Note that our getSex function
automatically classiﬁes the samples into two groups. We com-
pute the median for both Meth and Unmeth signals for each
array and display these in a scatterplot (Fig. 4B). This quality
control measure clearly identiﬁes two samples as outliers. Notice
that >95% of the samples have median log (base 2) intensity
values above 11.5. DNAm density plots (Fig. 4C) show that

3.3 SNPs inﬂuence probe behavior in small samples

For the blood data described above, we selected eight 68-year-old
individuals. Four of these were Caucasian and four Hispanic. We
computed the difference in average methylation between the two
ethnicities. Probes with SNPs showed larger differences
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). We then found the closest probe to
each of these SNP-affected probes and removed any pair sepa-
rated by >500 bp or where both probes were SNP affected. We
observed much larger differences at the SNP-affected probes
than at the neighboring probes (Supplementary Fig. S6B).

3.4 Bump hunting differentially methylated regions are
more likely to be near a differentially expressed gene
than Cst identiﬁed by single probe analysis

We downloaded and preprocessed raw data from 17 normal
colon and 19 normal lung TCGA samples. We used
preprocessQuantile and normalized all samples together. Note
that in this case, batch is confounded with tissue type. We iden-
tiﬁed differentially methylated loci using single probe analysis to
identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (Fig. 5B) and
bump hunting to identify differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) (Fig. 5A). To assess the biological relevance of the
two sets of loci, we used the assumption that a subset of differ-
entially expressed genes (DEGs) are epigenetically regulated and
associated with changes in DNAm. Therefore, a candidate dif-
ferentially methylated locus is more likely to be a functionally
relevant true positive if it is in proximity to a DEG. We note that
this evaluation only considers in cis; it does not assess changes in
trans such as methylation changes over distant regulatory
regions. In the absence of a dataset where the truth is known,
this evaluation provides an objective measure for which we have
an a priori expectation.

We downloaded gene expression data from normal lung
[11 = 20, Gene Expression Omnibus GSE31210 (Okayama et al.,
2012)] and colon samples [n = 54, GEO GSE20916 and
GSE41328 (Lin et al., 2006; Skrzypczak et al., 2010)] and pre-
processed these with frozen robust multiarray analysis (McCall
et al., 2010). We associated genes with methylation loci located
within 2kb of the transcriptional start site. We found that genes

Fig. 5. DMRs associate more strongly with gene expression than methy-
lation differences at single Cst, as observed in a dataset of normal lung
and colon samples. (A) An example of a tissue-DMR, identiﬁed by
bumphunter. The 15 Cst in the region show concordant methylation
differences. (B) An example of a significant tissue-DMP, identiﬁed by a
locus-level limma model. Note that the CpG probes adjacent to the DMP
do not show a methylation difference. (C) Between-tissue differential ex-
pression is greater for genes with a DMR located within 2kb of the
transcriptional start site (left) than for genes with a DMP located
within 2kb of the transcriptional start site (right). (D) A greater fraction
of DMRs is located close to DEG promoters than are DMPs

located in proximity to hypermethylated DMRs had a larger
decrease in expression level than genes located near loci identiﬁed
through single probe analysis (Fig. 5C). Further, using proximity
to a DEG as one metric of functional relevance, we also assessed
the fraction of differentially methylated loci located within 2kb
of a DEG transcriptional start site. We used a t-test to test for
differential expression between the tissue types and classiﬁed
probes with a nominal P<0.05 and a fold-change >1.5 as dif-
ferentially expressed. We found that regardless of the signiﬁcance
threshold used to identify differentially methylated loci, DEGs
were consistently more likely to be located near DMRs than
DMPs (Fig. 5D).

3.5 Block ﬁnding with 450k can identify
hypomethylation blocks

To assess the effectiveness of the block ﬁnding method in
minﬁ, we compared blocks identified in colon cancer on the
TCGA data (including the cancer samples that go with the
normal samples described above) with those reported in
(Hansen et al., 2011). Using default parameters (see Section 3
above), we identified 1540 hypomethylation blocks in colon
cancer containing five or more collapsed CpG clusters
(P<0.01). Although the regions identiﬁed using minﬁ are
based on completely independent colon normal and tumor sam-
ples, we found high agreement with methylation blocks identiﬁed

Fig. 6. Large regions of hypomethylation in colon cancer are reliably
identiﬁed by minfi. We used the block ﬁnding method on 450k data for
colon cancer and matched normal samples from the TCGA project. The
top (A) shows smoothed estimates of average methylation at the collapsed
locus level in the region plotted as Figure 2a in Hansen et al. (2011). Loss
of methylation in tumor is clearly observed in this region. The second
panel shows the methylation difference between cancer and normal. Dots
indicate the probe clusters used in the block ﬁnder algorithm, which
ignores clusters corresponding to CpG islands, shores or shelves.
The smoothed methylation difference used for segmentation is also
plotted. The gap in this smooth curve results from large genomic dis-
tances between probe clusters over which no smoothing is performed.
The bottom panel shows the minfi segmentation of the cluster-level
measurements, with blue indicating blocks of signiﬁcant hypomethyla-
tion. The bottom track are the blocks of methylation difference deﬁned
from whole-genome bisulﬁte sequencing in Hansen et al. (2011)
(B) Hypomethylation regions identified by minﬁ consistently overlap
hypomethylation blocks identiﬁed in Hansen et al. (2011)

in Hansen et al. (2011) (Fig. 6A). Speciﬁcally, 99.8% of the top
500 regions identified in the TCGA samples using minfi, sorted
by area, overlap a block identified in Hansen et al. (2011) by at
least 1000bp (Fig. 6B). Note that Figure 6 shows a gap in the
inferred blocks caused by the lack of probes on the array.

4 DISCUSSION

We have demonstrated several downstream advantages of using
the minfi package. Several preprocessing algorithms are available
and the infrastructure provides a convenient way for developers
to easily implement their techniques as Bioconductor tools. In
our experience, $10% of samples are of unusable quality, and
Visualization utilities provided by minfi permit users to identify
these samples at the earliest stage of the analysis. By making SNP
annotation available, users can choose to be cautious about
probes that may behave unexpectedly due to the inclusion of a
SNP in the probe sequence. We have demonstrated that DEGs
are more likely to be located near DMRs than Cst identiﬁed
by single probe analysis. Existing methods for identifying DMRs
typically use fixed-size or dynamic windows to group individu-
ally signiﬁcant DMPs into regions (http://www2.cancer.ucl.ac.
uk/medicalgenomics/champ/). Our software is unique in that it
provides both bump hunting and block ﬁnding capabilities, and
the assessment of statistical significance for the identified regions.
Finally, because the package is implemented in Bioconductor, it
gives users access to the countless analysis and Visualization tools
available in R.

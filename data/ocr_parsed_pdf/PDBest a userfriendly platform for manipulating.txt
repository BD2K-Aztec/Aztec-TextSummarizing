Abstract

Summary: PDBest (PDB Enhanced Structures Toolkit) is a user—friendly, freely available platform
for acquiring, manipulating and normalizing protein structures in a high—throughput and seamless
fashion. With an intuitive graphical interface it allows users with no programming background to
download and manipulate their files. The platform also exports protocols, enabling users to easily
share PDB searching and filtering criteria, enhancing analysis reproducibility.

Availability and implementation: PDBest installation packages are freely available for several plat—

forms at http://www.pdbest.dcc.ufmg.br

1 Introduction

Acquiring, manipulating and filtering large sets of biomolecule files
from repositories such as the Protein Data Bank, is a common and
important preprocessing step prior to protein structure studies. By
treating these files one aims to improve data quality, identifying
and/0r removing common idiosyncrasies that could compromise and
bias subsequent analysis. Common filtering tasks include, but are
not limited to: filtering multiple occupancies and models, splitting
files by chain, selecting subsets of atoms or residues, identifying
missing atoms or residues, generating an assessment report.

Given the relevance of Structural Biology and Bioinformatics,
several initiatives have been successful in developing software tools
and libraries for manipulating PDB files for different programming
languages, such as Python (Cock et (11., 2009), Java (Holland et (11.,
2008), R (Grant et (11., 2006) and others (Gajda, 2013), which are
widely used today.

It is, however, a task of great relevance for both educational and
scientific purposes to make the manipulation and study of such
source of data more accessible to a larger public (from

undergraduate students to researchers) without requiring a program—
ming background, while taking into account the ever increasing
scale of current data availability and guaranteeing the reproducibil—
ity of the process.

Despite the efforts of the community to make these capabilities
available as web services (Dolinsky et (11., 2007; Hussain et (11.,
2002; Wang et (11., 2005; Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007), there still is
a significant demand for an easy—to—use, scalable platform for treat—
ing protein structures.

To fill this gap, we have developed PDBest (PDB Enhanced
Structures Toolkit), a user—friendly, freely available platform for
acquiring, manipulating and normalizing protein structures in a re—
producible, high—throughput and seamless fashion.

2 Platform description and workflow

PDBest was developed aiming to achieve four major goals: (i) pro—
vide means to improve data quality in Structural Biology/
Bioinformatics; (ii) make it accessible for a larger public; (iii)

provide scalability and parallel processing; (iv) as well as reproduci—
bility and reusability.

To establish a high—quality structural database, PDB files
of interest need to be collected and properly preprocessed and/0r
cleaned. Many of these cleaning tasks are common to different
studies (as the example in Fig. S1 of Supplementary Material),
including treating NMR models or multiple occupancies
while others are more specific (e.g. filtering subsets of residues or
atoms).

To cope with these demands PDBest provides an intuitive graph—
ical user interface (GUI), as depicted on Figure 1A. It was designed
to make these tasks accessible to a broader public since no command
line or programming experience is require, and also taking advan—
tage of the emergence of multi—core architectures, dramatically
reducing processing time via parallel processing. The software plat—
form was developed in C++ language on the QT framework, pro—
viding high performance for all major operating systems: Windows,
Unix/Linux and Mac OS X. Many capabilities, including adding
hydrogens and file format conversions, were implemented using the
OpenBabel library (OLBoyle et al., 2011).

To achieve reproducibility, we have developed the PDBest proto—
col file. The protocol file encompasses all user—defined filtering pref—
erences, data collection and filtering options that can be easily
shared, improving work reproducibility and the creation of filtering
standards. Figure 1B shows PDBest capabilities and pipeline which
is divided in the stages described next.

Data Acquisition: Structure files can be loaded into PDBest in
three ways: (i) by submitting an ‘Online Query’ to the RCSB PDB
mirror; (ii) by loading local files or (iii) a combination of both.
Using (i) users are able to search for structures using all parameters
available at the RSCB web site, performing complex queries includ—
ing logical operators ‘and’/‘0r’ in any combination. N0 restriction
on the number of PDB files to be acquired is imposed. Online
queries are also compatible with those of well established servers,
like the PISCES web server (Wang et al., 2005). Figure 1A shows
how a PISCES—like query can be performed using PDBest.

Filtering Standards: After acquiring the PDB files users can set
preprocessing steps to be applied. It is possible to edit or filter any
information described in the PDB File Format Documentation, as
well as converting between known biological file formats. Amongst
the main filtering capabilities are included: splitting files by chain,
selecting models, parsing ligands, adding/removing hydrogens, treat—
ing multiple occupancies, renumbering residues and atoms as well as
selecting subsets of atoms or residues of interest.

Output and Processing: Processed PDB files are generated, with
new suffixes defined by the user. A detailed report can be presented
highlighting files with identifies issues (missing residues, missing
atoms, multiple occupancies or any inconsistencies).

Reproducibility wit/7 PDBest—Protocol file: PDBest can also
generate a protocol file which stores user section information, filter—
ing parameters, online query and steps employed to generate the
data set. This enables users to reuse and share data acquisition and
preparation steps, improving reproducibility of the work and subsi—
dizing the creation of processing standards. A tutorial with examples
of usage is available as Supplementary Material.

3Condu§on

PDBest offers a powerful, user—friendly interface between re—
searchers/students in Structural Biology and common processing
tasks for protein structural files. Its graphical interface provides an
efficient, yet accessible, way to acquire, manipulate and check PDB
files as means to improve data quality and integrity.

The platform is capable of parallel processing, taking advantage
of current multi—core architectures and providing scalability for its
pipeline. On top of that, PDBest enables users to share acquisition
and filtering protocols, improving work reproducibility and the cre—
ation of filtering standards for research groups.

PDBest is available for all major Operating Systems and has been
thoroughly tested and proved fundamental on many structure—based
studies in our group including: inter—residue contact analysis (da Silveira
et al., 2009), receptor—based ligand prediction (Pires et al., 2013),

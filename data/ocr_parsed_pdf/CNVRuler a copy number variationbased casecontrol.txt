ABSTRACT

Summary: The method for genome-wide association study (GWAS)
based on copy number variation (CNV) is not as well established
as that for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)—GWAS. Although
there are several tools for CNV association studies, most of them
do not provide appropriate definitions of CNV regions (CNVRs),
which are essential for CNV-association studies. Here we present a
user-friendly program called CNVRuler for CNV-association studies.
Outputs from the 10 most common CNV defining algorithms can
be directly used as input files for determining the three different
definitions of CNVRs. Once CNVRs are defined, CNVRuler supports
four kinds of statistical association tests and options for population
stratification. CNVRuler is based on the open-source programs R and
Java from Sun Microsystems.

Availability: CNVRuler software is available with an online manual
at the website, www.ircgp.com/CNVRuler/index.html

1 INTRODUCTION

Copy number variation (CNV) is thought to contribute to inter-
individual differences in phenotypes including disease susceptibility
(Feuk et al. 2006; McCarroll and Altshuler, 2007; Yim et al.
2010). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are always
represented as categorical values, while copy number variations
(CNVs) are often represented as regions consisting of continuous
values for consecutive probes. For this reason, the following
three steps are required to perform a CNV-based genome-wide
association study (GWAS): (i) calling CNVs, (ii) merging CNVs
into common CNV regions (CNVRs), and (iii) statistical analysis
of the associations. Despite the importance and popularity of CNV—
phenotype association studies, there are not many algorithms that
provide all three key steps mentioned above.

 

lThe authors wish it to be known that. in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First Authors
*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A number of tools supporting CNV—disease association analysis
have been developed (Supplementary Table S1). However, most of
these tools do not offer methods for deﬁning the CNVRs and require
additional manual processes for converting the input CNV calls into
ﬁles suitable for statistical analysis. In order to support the steps from
merging CNVs into CNVRs to CNVR-based association analysis in
a single software program, we developed a user-friendly tool for
CNV—GWAS, called CNVRuler.

2 DESCRIPTION

CNVRuler was designed to deﬁne three different types of CNVRs
from the predeﬁned CNVs and provides four statistical methods
for CNVR-based association studies. The overall analysis ﬂow in
CNVRuler is illustrated in Figure 1. All forms of major CNV
call outputs from different segmentation tools such as Genotyping
Console, Genome Studio, Genomic Workbench, PennCNV and
Nexus can be processed without additional conversion steps. Details
are described in the user manual.

2.1 Prerequisites

CNVRuler requires Java Runtime Environment from Sun
Microsystems or the equivalent (JRE 31.6.0). The major functions
of CNVRuler algorithms are implemented in R program as a
calculation core.

2.2 Processing CNV data

Outputs from the 10 CNV deﬁning algorithms can be used
directly as input ﬁles for determining the CNVRs with CNVRuler
(Supplementary Table S2). Alternatively, CNVRuler can read
a manually prepared custom tab-delimited text ﬁle of CNV
information to build the CNVRs including next-generation
sequencing data as a user-customized text ﬁle. Users can ﬁlter out
the CNVs by size and signal intensity threshold. Details are available
in the user manual.

2.3 Building CNVRs

For association analyses, each CNVR should have the same
boundaries among subjects such that each subject will be coded as
CNVR-gain positive, CNVR-loss positive, or diploid. CNVRuler
supports three different deﬁnitions of common CNV regions.

Infomatlon of CNVR Frequency 8. Type Result

Fig. 1. Flowchart of CNV-association study with CNVRuler. CNVRuler
imports segmentation and clinical information from various CNV-deﬁning
tools and reports the phenotype-association candidates by association
analysis

Flowcharts of each building process are presented in Supplementary
Figure S1. First, individual CNVs are merged into CNVRs, which
are genomic regions covering CNVs overlapping by at least lbp
(Redon et al. 2006). This process is simple and straightforward,
but it may overestimate the size of CNVRs when any of the
overlapping CNVs are extremely long (see user manual). In order
to minimize this possibility, CNVRuler provides the option to
assess the regional density of the participating CNVs base-by-base
and trim the low-density areas. For example, the area covered
by <10% of the total contributing CNVs within a CNVR will
be removed by default. The density threshold for trimming can
be selected by the user. Second, common CNV regions can also
be determined by reciprocal overlap (R0). R0 is the degree of
overlap between any two CNV calls deﬁned as the overlap of
one CNV with another over a predeﬁned threshold value (Conrad
et al. 2010). In CNVRuler, we set the RO threshold to 0.5.
The third deﬁnition involves splitting the overlapping regions
into fragments. Since this deﬁnition generates a larger number of
fragments, the calculation time is longer than that in other methods.
To validate the CNVRuler, we used the CNVs identiﬁed from
Affymetrix SNP array 6.0 genotyping data of 10 individuals and
deﬁned CNVRs using CNVRuler and CONAN software (Forer
et al. 2010). Nearly 100% of the CNVRs deﬁned by the three
methods of CNVRuler were deﬁned by CONAN (Supplementary
Figure S2).

2.4 Association analysis

CNVRuler supports chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests in addition
to logistic and linear regression analyses using deﬁned CNVRs and

clinical information. Clinical information can be easily coded into
a simple tab-delimited text ﬁle format. Both the false discovery
rate and Bonferroni correction can be used for multiple testing
with this software. There is an option to remove the CNVRs from
the association analysis based on the frequency (see user manual).
CNVRuler supports the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which can be
used to assess the goodness-of—ﬁt of logistic regression models.
For population stratiﬁcation, CNVRuler uses principal component
analysis. It calculates eigenvectors and uses up to 3 principal
components as covariates of regression.

In order to validate the performance of CNVRuler, we applied
the data of 4574 CNVs identiﬁed in 500 cases of subarachnoid
aneurysmal hemorrhage using Illumina HumanHap300 BeadChip
(Bae et al. 2010). The three different CNVR-deﬁning algorithms
identiﬁed different numbers of CNVRs: 1843 CNVRs, 2211 ROs
and 2797 fragments (Supplementary Table S3). We compared the
lists of our CNVRs with a raw P-value <0.01 with Bae et al.’s
signiﬁcant CNVs. Two signiﬁcant CNVs identiﬁed by Bae et al.
(copy number loss in 4q31.3 and copy number gain in 10p15.1)
were detected by all three algorithms of CNVRuler. In association
analyses, the two CNVRs were consistently signiﬁcant in univariate
models regardless of the CNVR-deﬁning algorithm (Supplementary
Table S4). However, our CNVRs were not signiﬁcant in logistic
regression models adjusted for age and sex and for multiple
comparisons by the FDR method. This discrepancy may be partly
due to the different correction methods applied for multiple
comparisons and the difference between region-based and probe-
based analyses (Bae et al. 2010).

CNVRuler can handle both common and rare CNVs once CNVs
are called. Different from common CNPs, rare CNVs can cause
complete or quasi ‘separation’ in 2><2 tables, where the odds
ratios cannot be calculated or the approximation of signiﬁcance
is inadequate. For example, complete separation occurs when a
particular CNVR aggregates in cases, but it is not found at all
in controls. In these situations, users can select the X2 test with
Yates’ continuity correction or Fisher’s exact test. There are different
opinions regarding which of these two methods to choose; so users
should use their own statistical knowledge and discretion. After this
step, users can perform exact logistic regression analysis or other
methods specialized for dealing with a small number of events or
small sample sizes, but CNVRuler does not provide these specialized
regression methods at the moment.

3 CONCLUSION

CNVRuler is a user-friendly program with multiple functions that
support all procedures of CNV—phenotype association analysis in a
single system without requiring any additional manual processes.

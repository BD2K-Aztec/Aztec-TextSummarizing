2.2 Compendium annotation

To improve biological interpretation of the compendium, we integrated
gene (row) and contrast (column) annotation from publicly available re-
sources and curated all available information.

To facilitate gene selection, we included, next to gene ids from 5b.60
genome release, gene names from MaizeGDB (Lawrence et al., 2004) and
Xref assignments from www.maizesequence.org to provide mapping from
EntrezGene and UniProt ids. As for functional annotations, metabolic
pathway information (version 2.0) from Gramene (Youens-Clark et al.,
2010) and Gene Ontology annotations from www.maizesequence.org
were provided.

To compensate for the often cryptic and incomplete condition anno-
tations available in public expression repositories, we provided curated
annotations incorporating the information from both online repositories
and the corresponding publications. Note that in our compendium, ex-
pression values are represented as log-ratios of a contrast between two
samples. Experimental annotation is provided both at the level of the
individual sample and that of the contrast. Annotation at the sample
level includes tissue, development stage and genotype speciﬁcations
(breeding line). The ﬁrst two are described using Plant Ontology
(Avraham et al., 2008)-derived ontology terms, whereas genotype speci-
f1cations are based on the names of cultivars or wild-type. At the contrast
level, we associated perturbation annotations specified as a set of relevant
properties and corresponding values of change that reﬂect the stimuli that
trigger expression alterations in the test versus the reference.

2.3 Compendium exploration

To facilitate the exploration of the compendium, we constructed a web
access portal MAGIC providing a set of analysis functionalities. At first,
MAGIC allows users to specify their own subcompendium of interest,
which only contains contrasts sharing the same characteristics. Users can
choose between various predeﬁned subcompendia. Subcompendia focus-
ing on environmental perturbations and on comparisons between lines,
between tissues and between development stages are available.
Alternatively, users can generate customized subcompendia based on
the sample and contrast annotations.

Once a (sub)compendium is selected, the system provides tools to ex-
plore and visualize the expression data in a module-centralized manner
where a module is defined as a subset of the (sub)compendium containing
the expression values of a set of genes under a set of contrasts. A module
can be created starting from a query set of genes or contrasts to which
contrasts or genes are added, respectively, based on their properties (such
as the coexpression level, or the expression consistency). An existing
module can easily be altered, merged with other modules or split into
several modules. Each module can be visualized as an interactive heatmap
accompanied with corresponding annotation information.

Because most of the microarray platforms that MAGIC relies on were
developed before the genome release of maize, none of them cover the full
FGS gene set, and overlap in measured genes can be low for some plat-
form combinations (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We developed
functionalities that help users to control the number of missing values
in their analysis results (Website online help, section 6).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The compendium available through MAGIC currently contains
24 690 genes and 1310 sample contrasts. It covers 62% of the
genes in FGS of the 5b.60 release of B73 maize genome; the
remaining genes are not represented on any of the 27 platforms
included. The contrasts consist of 69 experiments obtained from
GEO and ArrayExpress, amounting to 1749 microarrays. Details
on the composition of the compendium in terms of the number

of genes and experiments covered per platform can be found in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. On average, a gene is mea—
sured in 9 of the 26 platforms and has been measured in 592 of
1310 contrasts (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The compen—
dium can be downloaded through its webportal MAGIC. An
elaborate online help, together with two tutorial case studies,
illustrates how the various functionalities of MAGIC can be
used to infer new biology. The case studies clearly illustrate
how information from different platforms contributes to the re—
sults obtained by MAGIC, and how to cope with missing values
that could become abundant if information from certain sets of
platforms is combined.

In contrast to MAGIC, comparable initiatives treat data from
different platforms or experiments separately. Genevestigator
(Hruz et al., 2008) and CORNET (De Bodt et al., 2012) con—
struct separate compendia for the Affymetrix Maize Genome
Array (GPL4032) (containing 558 and 340 arrays for
Genevestigator and CORNET) and the Nimblegen Maize
385 k Array (GPL12620) (containing 180 arrays in both systems).
PLEde (Dash et al., 2011), on the other hand, provides access
to the data from 44 Affymetrix and Nimblegen experiments. In
this system, data derived from each experiment are treated sep—
arately instead of being merged in a larger compendium. Of all
these systems, only CORNET provides a restricted meta—analysis
tool that allows combining information across the different com—
pendia. Compared with these related initiatives, our approach is
unique in directly combining data from different platforms in a
single compendium, obviating the need for an additional meta—
analysis step (Fierro et al., 2008) and enabling the construction
of a much larger compendium and the direct data analysis across
different platforms and experiments.

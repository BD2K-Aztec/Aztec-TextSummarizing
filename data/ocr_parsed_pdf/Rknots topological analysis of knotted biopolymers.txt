ABSTRACT

Motivation: Rknots is a flexible R package providing tools for the
detection and characterization of topological knots in biological
polymers. The package is well documented and provides a simple
syntax for data import and preprocessing, structure reduction,
topological analyses and 2D and 3D visualization. Remarkably,
Rknots is not limited to protein knots and allows researchers from
interdisciplinary fields to analyze different topological structures and
to develop simple yet fully custom pipelines.

Availability: Rknots is distributed under the GPL-2 license and is
available from the CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive network) at
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rknots

1 INTRODUCTION

The topological study of knotted biological polymers is an active
interdisciplinary ﬁeld of research (Bolinger et (11., 2010; Marenduzzo
et (11., 2009; Shakhnovich, 2011). In polymers, knots inﬂuence
both material properties and polymer chain dynamics (Koniaris and
Muthukumar, 1991). Informally, knots are Closed curves in 3D and
links are collections of non-intersecting knots. Hence, knot theory
deals with Closed structures (see Supplementary Material for an
informal introduction to the subject). However, the vast majority of
biological or synthetic polymers are open chains. In this context,
the deﬁnition of knot is relaxed and transferred to open curves.
A chain is knotted if it does not disentangle after being pulled from
both ends.

Nature tends to avoid knots. Knotted protein backbones are
rare (Taylor, 2007; Virnau et (11., 2006) and the physical
mechanisms governing their formation is largely unknown.
Intriguing experimental results unraveling protein knots properties
have recently been reported (Sayre et (11 ., 2011; Virnau et (11 ., 2011)
and in certain viral capsids there are evidences of mechanisms
preventing knotted DNA formation (Bumier et (11., 2008). In order
to understand structural properties of knotted polymers, rigorous
yet simply to use, generalized computational methods are required.
Web servers for protein knots analysis (Kolesov et (11., 2007; Lai
et (11., 2007) nicely accomplished this for proteins. However, the

underlying framework cannot be generalized to cope with more
complex structures and it cannot be customized.

In this note we present Rknots, an R package combining a
generalized framework for the topological analysis of knotted
biopolymers with the beneﬁts of R programming. Different
structures can be analyzed with a simple syntax and methods
have been implemented accounting for modularity. Rknots requires
a standard R installation and depends on bio3d (Grant et (11.,
2006 available from http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/~bgrant/bio3d/),
rgl [Adler,D. and Murdoch,D. (2011) rgl: 3D visualization device
system (OpenGL)] and rsympy [Grothendieck,G. et (11. (2010)
rSymPy: R interface to SymPy computer algebra system. R
package version 0.2-1.1]. In the following we will provide an
overview of the available methods. A case study on a knotted
protein will be used as an example. Additional examples can
be found in the package manual and vignette at http://cran.
r-project.org/web/packages/Rknots

2 APPROACH

Proteins can be loaded in .pdb format from the ﬁle system or
by fetching the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et (11., 2000)
and they undergo a dedicated preprocessing (see Supplementary
Material). Coordinates are then stored in the S4 Knot class (see
the package vignette for details) and the following workﬂow
applies afterwards. First, open Chains are Closed and a knot
diagram is obtained through the here proposed principal component
analysis projection (PCAP) algorithm (see Supplementary Material).
Figure 1A illustrates a protein diagram obtained with PCAP, whereas
Figure lB—D illustrate the results of a simulation on 1000 proteins
sampled randomly from the PDB in comparison to a set of generic
projections or to standard projection (see Supplementary Material
for details). Second, the structure is reduced to the minimal set of
points topologically equivalent to the original structure, by applying
a reduction algorithm. This step removes structural redundancies,
speeding up downstream computations. Two structure reduction
algorithms, Alexander-Briggs (Alexander and Briggs, 1926) and
MSR (Comoglio and Rinaldi, 2011) are implemented in Rknots.
The former has been proposed for the ﬁrst time in polymers knot
theory by Koniaris and Muthukumar (Comoglio and Rinaldi, 2011;
Koniaris and Muthukumar, 1991). We also provide an extension of
this algorithm for links.

Finally, knots can be detected in the minimal structure by
computing a topological invariant, generally a polynomial. Protein
knots discovered so far are among the simplest types (Bolinger et (11.,
2010; Virnau et (11 ., 2006). The Alexander polynomial is sufﬁcient to

characterize them unambiguously. Being its computation faster than
other polynomial invariants, the Alexander polynomial is preferred
when a large number of structures has to be tested. A normalized
multivariable version of the Alexander polynomial (MVA) is also
implemented in Rknots (see Supplementary Material) and it can
be applied to the analysis of link structures such as catenanes.
Rknots is not limited to the analysis of proteins. The Jones and
the HOMFLY polynomial have been implemented to analyze more
complex structures. Additionally, they are able to determine knots
chirality. The next section shows how to apply the described
workﬂow to the analysis of a protein knot.

3 APPLICATION

The following example illustrates a typical Rknots session for the
analysis of a protein of interest. A monomeric left-handed trefoil
knotted protein (PDB ID 2k0a) has been selected for this case study.
First, the protein is imported with the function loadProtein.
Gaps ﬁnding is performed with default parameter (cutoff : 7):

library (Rknots)
pdb <— loadProtein(pdeD = "2KOA", cutoff = 7)

Second, a Knot object is created simply by providing the protein
coordinates of the single polypeptide chain to newKnot:

chain < — newKnot (pdb$A)

Third, the open chain is closed and projected using the
closeAndProject function. The knot diagram can then be
visualized with plot:

chain <— closeAndProject(chain)
plot(chain, lwd = 1.5)

Then, the knot type is determined by computing a polynomial
invariant with the computeInvariant function. By setting

invariant : "HOMFLY", the HOMFLY polynomial is
returned:
computeInvariant(chain, invariant = "HOMFLY")

Finally, further information on the knot type can be obtained with
the ﬁmction getKno tType (see the package vignette for details).

4 CONCLUSION

Rknots is the ﬁrst package providing generalized tools for the study
of knotted biopolymers. The modularity of the package allows
integration in custom pipelines. We encourage contributions from
other members of the research community.

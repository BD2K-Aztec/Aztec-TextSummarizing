ABSTRACT

Motivation: Drawing genomic features in attractive and informative
ways is a key task in visualization of genomics data. Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG) format is a modern and flexible open standard that
provides advanced features including modular graphic design,
advanced web interactivity and animation within a suitable client.
SVGs do not suffer from loss of image quality on re-scaling and pro-
vide the ability to edit individual elements of a graphic on the whole
object level independent of the whole image. These features make
SVG a potentially useful format for the preparation of publication qual-
ity figures including genomic objects such as genes or sequencing
coverage and for web applications that require rich user-interaction
with the graphical elements.

Results: SVGenes is a Ruby-language library that uses SVG primi-
tives to render typical genomic glyphs through a simple and flexible
Ruby interface. The library implements a simple Page object that
spaces and contains horizontal Track objects that in turn style,
colour and positions features within them. Tracks are the level at
which visual information is supplied providing the full styling capabil-
ity of the SVG standard. Genomic entities like genes, transcripts
and histograms are modelled in Glyph objects that are attached
to a track and take advantage of SVG primitives to render the gen-
omic features in a track as any of a selection of defined glyphs.
The feature model within SVGenes is simple but flexible and not
dependent on particular existing gene feature formats meaning
graphics for any existing datasets can easily be created without
need for conversion.

Availability: The library is provided as a Ruby Gem from https://ruby-
gems.org/gems/bio-svgenes under the MIT license, and open source
code is available at https://github.com/danmaclean/bioruby-svgenes

1 INTRODUCTION

Visualization, analysis and communication of genome data is
an important task in genomics. Numerous desktop computer
programs exist for rendering images of genomic data, usually
in analytic pipelines including Artemis (Carver et al., 2008).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Genome browsers such as Gbrowse (Stein et al., 2002),
JBrowse (Skinner et al., 2009), Savant (Fiume et al., 2010)
and IGV (Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013) provide interactive visu-
alization of the data for whole genomes and draft assemblies.
Output from these is typically limited to an exported bitmap or
screen grab in the program’s particular ﬁxed style. Graphics
libraries such as GD and ImageMagick have been used in
projects like BioPerl (Stajich et al., 2002) and BioRuby
(Goto et al., 2010) to create uniquely styled bitmap images
like PNG and JPEG programmatically. BioRubys bio-graphics
package has similar functionality to bio-svgenes and relies on
external libraries such as Cairo, Pango and ImageMagick. The
Bio.Graphics module in Biopython (Cock et al., 2009) also
supports output in SVG through the use of third-party soft-
ware [ReportLab (http://www.reportlab.com/)]. Bitmap images
are limited in that they are not easy to re-annotate, re-scale
and often cannot be reproduced for publication or presentation
with high-fidelity because of limitations of the original bitmaps.
Bitmaps can be difﬁcult to manipulate and are not easily
amenable to the addition of interactive features. Interactive
graphics can be provided in web-browsers through JavaScript
libraries such as D3.js but there are no such libraries available
speciﬁcally for easy rendering of genomic data. Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based graphic standard under de-
velopment by the World Wide Web Consortium that provides
many advantages for those seeking to produce rich, attractive
images. SVG is a vector format so does not suffer image qual-
ity degradation on rescaling, has advanced image features such
as alpha masks and ﬁlter effects, web-interactivity and can be
styled with Cascading Style Sheets. Furthermore, as a text-
based format, SVG is well suited for searching and indexing
in databases and is amenable to lossless compression. SVG can
be rendered by modern web-browsers and graphics software
including Adobe’s Illustrator and the open source Inkscape
programs. SVG output is available from some applications.
CGView (Grant et al., 2012) and Circos (Krzywinski et al.,
2009) are good tools for viewing circular genomes in particular.
GenomeDiagram (Pritchard et al., 2006) is designed to dis-
play large amounts of comparative genomics data. MGV
(Kerkhoven et al., 2004) is a database-driven web application
designed speciﬁcally for microbial data and AnnotationSketch
(Steinbiss et al., 2009), which is dependant on third-party soft-
ware. SVGenes is a pure Ruby language library that allows a
user to set styles for tracks of genomic features and will auto-
matically layout and generate SVG images composed of several
pre-deﬁned genomics glyphs, including genes, transcripts, data
and single-nucleotide features.

2 APPROACH

SVGenes uses a simple feature Page-Track-Feature model to
organize the genomic data and to apply style information
provided to it.

2.1 The page and track object

The page object represents the area into which feature tracks
are drawn, it has straightforward width, height and background
attributes. Height is not ﬁxed and is recalculated if more space is
required to render all the constituent features at the speciﬁed
sizes. The background attribute of the page can be styled, and
an automatically generated scale bar is created and added to the
top of the rendered page. Instantiating new track objects is the
main way that styling information is speciﬁed, the track attri-
butes set the ﬁnal visual style of the genomic features and is
responsible for placing them within the track on the page.

2.2 Glyphs and feature objects

SVGenes can render genomic features using various glyphs
including gene, transcript and point features. Data tracks repre-
senting, e.g. sequence read coverage can be rendered as histo-
grams and the ﬂexible styling options allow for a great deal of

Fig. 1. Rendering of features from the TAIR 10 annotation of the
Arabidopsis genome (Lamesch et al., 2012). The region shown is
Chromosome 3: 19597 235k19637 249. Tracks contain (from top to
bottom) (i) Genes with the ’directed’ glyph, (ii) mRNAs with the ‘tran-
script’ glyph, (iii) cDNA matches with the ‘directed’ glyph, (iv) micro-
array probes with the ‘generic’ glyph, (v) insertions with the ‘down
triangle’ glyph, (vi) deletions with the ‘up triangle’ glyph, (vii) TE inser-
tions with the ‘circle’ glyph, (viii) a data track showing simulated NGS
data (height calculated from a sine function of the genome position) and
(ix) a data track showing random bar heights

variety of appearance (Fig. 1 shows some examples). Each glyph
takes style information from the track, and full SVG styling
syntax can be used for arbitrary styling information including
opacity settings. HTML colours and some pre-deﬁned gradient
ﬁlls are available through keyword declaration, greatly simplify-
ing basic styling. The feature object represents genomic features
simply and ﬂexibly. As a minimum, start and stop positions are
required for the basic glyphs. Grouped features such as tran-
scripts are represented by start and stop information for the
parent object and start and stops for the block elements
within, such as exons and untranslated regions. Data glyphs
are bars with start, width and height elements.

2.3 Workﬂow

SVGenes provides programmatic and conﬁguration-based ren-
dering workﬂows. Within a Ruby script, a user may manually
instantiate a page object and attach tracks as required, then
create and add the feature objects to the appropriate tracks.
This workﬂow does not rely on any particular feature ﬁle
format. For input from the popular GFF format, a conﬁgur-
ation-based workﬂow is provided. In this, the user is able to
create a JSON conﬁguration ﬁle that describes each track and
contains links to a file containing the features or data values to
be rendered in each track.

3 CONCLUSION

SVGenes is a useful and ﬂexible library for creating easily
manipulated, high-quality, web-friendly images of genomic data
quickly and easily in SVG format without embedding a bitmap.
The library can be used for visualization at many levels; in high-
throughput pipelines and web applications, but individual users
preparing figures for publication will also ﬁnd the library ex-
tremely useful, as the individual elements of the images can be
independently manipulated and annotated and composited.

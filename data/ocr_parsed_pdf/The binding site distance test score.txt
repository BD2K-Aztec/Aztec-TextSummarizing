ABSTRACT

Motivation: We propose a novel method for scoring the accuracy of
protein binding site predictions—the Binding-site Distance Test (BDT)
score. Recently, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) has
been used to evaluate binding site predictions, both by developers
of new methods and by the assessors for the community-wide
prediction experiment—CASP8. While being a rigorous scoring
method, the MCC does not take into account the actual 3D location
of the predicted residues from the observed binding site. Thus, an
incorrectly predicted site that is nevertheless close to the observed
binding site will obtain an identical score to the same number of
non-binding residues predicted at random. The MCC is somewhat
affected by the subjectivity of determining observed binding residues
and the ambiguity of choosing distance cutoffs. By contrast the
BDT method produces continuous scores ranging between 0 and
1, relating to the distance between the predicted and observed
residues. Residues predicted close to the binding site will score
higher than those more distant, providing a better reflection of the
true accuracy of predictions. The CASP8 function predictions were
evaluated using both the MCC and BDT methods and the scores
were compared. The BDT was found to strongly correlate with the
MCC scores while also being less susceptible to the subjectivity of
defining binding residues. We therefore suggest that this new simple
score is a potentially more robust method for future evaluations of
protein—ligand binding site predictions.

1 INTRODUCTION

The prediction of a protein’s ligand binding site location and
potential interacting residues is important in the elucidation of
protein function, de novo drug design, mutagenesis studies and
ligand binding speciﬁcity (Lopez et (11., 2009; Sankararaman
et (11., 2010). The CASP experiment included a function prediction
category for the ﬁrst time in CASP6 (Soro and Tramontano, 2005),
where the aim was to predict the Enzyme Commission number (EC)
and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Due to the difﬁculty in assessing
these terms, the CASP7 (Lopez et (11., 2007) assessors decided that
CASP was not the best place for this format of ﬁmction prediction.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Thus, for CASP8, ﬁmction prediction was included in a different
format, with the assessment of observed ligand binding site residues,
as many CASP targets were shown to crystallize with biologically
interesting ligands (Lopez et (11., 2009).

In CASP8, ﬁmction predictions were assessed using the Matthews
correlation coefﬁcient (MCC) (Matthews, 1975). The MCC is a
statistical metric that utilizes the number of true positive, false
positive, false negative and true negative residues, giving a score
between 1 and — l. A score of 1 indicates a prefect prediction and a
score close to 0 indicates a random prediction. The MCC provides
a good assessment statistic, because it heavily penalizes both over
and under predictions and is appropriate for biased datasets, such as
binding versus non-binding residues (Lopez et (11., 2009).

In order to assess binding residue prediction accuracy, the
observed binding site residues must be deﬁned. However, deﬁning
which residues are in contact with a ligand can often be subjective,
particularly if we consider the inherent ﬂexibility of protein
backbones, side chains and many large ligands. The distances used to
deﬁne residue—ligand contacts can be adjusted; nevertheless, once a
cutoff has been set all ‘non-binding’ residues are treated as incorrect
by the MCC score, regardless of their distance from the site.

The top methods in the function prediction category of CASP8
were methods by the Lee group (Oh et (11., 2009) and the Sternberg
group (Wass and Sternberg, 2009). Both groups assessed their
own predictions by two additional metrics: accuracy and coverage.
However, these metrics also penalize close predictions to a similar
extent as the MCC statistic (Oh et (11., 2009; Wass and Sternberg,
2009).

In this article we are proposing a simple new metric, the Binding-
site Distance Test (BDT) score, which addresses the problems
associated with the MCC while maintaining the advantages. The
score is highly correlated with the MCC, and it appropriately
penalizes both under and over predictions, while also considering
the distance of predicted residues from the observed binding site.

2 METHODS

The BDT score was calculated by considering: the list of residue numbers
in the protein predicted to be binding to a ligand, the list of residue numbers
observed to be binding to a ligand, the PDB ﬁle of the observed structure
(with residue numbering matching that of the sequence) and a distance
threshold.

The Euclidean distance was calculated between each residue in the
predicted set and each residue in the observed set. The distance was then
converted to an S -score using the standard equation:

calculated using different values for do, the optimal values are from 1 to 3 A.

 

Fig. 1. Ribbon diagram of CASP8 target T0453. Hypothetical predicted
residues are shown as grey sticks and the observed binding residues (76, 77,
78, 83) are shown as black sticks. For the ﬁrst prediction on the left (32, 33,
34, 35) the MCC score is —0.046 and the BDT score is 0.017 (with do = 3).
For the second prediction on the right (75, 79, 82, 84), again the MCC score
is —0.046; however, the BDT score is 0.384 (with do = 3).

Where S; was the S-score between a predicted residue 1' and an observed
residue j, dij was the Euclidean distance between the C-alpha coordinates
of residues 1' and j and do was a distance threshold (values between 1 and
3 A are recommended, see Table 1). The maximum Sij score, max(S,]-), was
then determined for each predicted residue. The ﬁnal BDT score was simply
the sum of the maximum Sij scores normalized by the greater value of the
number of predicted residues (Np) and the number of observed residues (N0):

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A potential problem with relying on the MCC is illustrated in
Figure l, where two hypothetical binding site predictions are shown
for CASP8 target T0453. The prediction on the right hand side
of the ﬁgure (75, 79, 82, 84) is closer to the observed binding
site than the prediction shown on the left hand side of the image
(32, 33, 34, 35); however, both predictions are assigned identical
MCC scores (—0.046). Conversely using the BDT score with do = 3,
the prediction close to the site on the right is assigned a higher

score (0.384) compared with that of the more distant prediction
on the left (0.017). Using the MCC, all ‘non-binding’ residues
in a prediction are considered equal, no matter how close they
are to the actual site. Thus, small changes to the list of observed
binding site residues can greatly affect the MCC score of close
predictions. Further examples using real CASP8 predictions are
shown in Supplementary Figure 2.

The BDT score ranges between 0 and l, where perfect predictions
achieve scores of l and distant predictions are assigned scores closer
to 0. If we consider the ﬂexibility of both ligands and proteins as
well as the possibility of alternative ligands binding to the same site,
the BDT score is a more appropriate score than the MCC. The BDT
score takes into account the actual structure and distances between
predicted and observed binding residues. Residues deemed false
positives that are nevertheless close to the binding site score higher
than distant predictions using the BDT score.

The distance threshold do in the S,- score alters the range
of BDT scores; however, BDT scores with different cutoffs are
highly correlated with conserved ranking. The BDT scoring method
maintains the penalty for over and under predictions, using the
normalization max(Np, No), it is appropriate for biased datasets and
the scores are highly correlated with the MCC scores (Table 1,
Supplementary Table 1), even though the metrics are conceptually
different. There is an approximately linear dependence between
the BDT scores at each cutoff and the MCC scores; however,
the Spearman’s ,0 and Kendall’s 1' also show that the ranking of
predictions is also maintained. The value for do may be adjusted to
vary the stringency of the score (Table l). Outliers in plots of MCC
scores versus BDT scores (Supplementary Fig. l) are illustrated by
the example in Figure 1.

Finally, the BDT score is relatively easy to calculate and because
the actual PDB ﬁle is required for calculation there is no ambiguity
concerning the missing residues (i.e. disordered regions) (for this
article, all missing residues were also excluded from the calculation
of MCC scores). Furthermore, the BDT score minimizes the penalty
for ambiguous predicted residues that might be considered to be in
the active site, or are considered to be in contact with an alternative
ligand, but are nevertheless excluded from the observed subset
(Supplementary Fig. 2B).

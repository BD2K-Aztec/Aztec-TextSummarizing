Abstract

Summary: Circos plots are graphical outputs that display three dimensional chromosomal inter—
actions and fusion transcripts. However, the Circos plot tool is not an interactive visualization tool,
but rather a figure generator. For example, it does not enable data to be added dynamically nor
does it provide information for specific data points interactively. Recently, an R—based Circos tool
(RCircos) has been developed to integrate Circos to R, but similarly, Rcircos can only be used to
generate plots. Thus, we have developed a Circos plot tool (J—Circos) that is an interactive visualiza—
tion tool that can plot Circos figures, as well as being able to dynamically add data to the figure,
and providing information for specific data points using mouse hover display and zoom in/out
functions. J—Circos uses the Java computer language to enable, it to be used on most operating
systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux). Users can input data into J—Circos using flat data formats, as
well as from the Graphical user interface (GUI). J—Circos will enable biologists to better study more
complex chromosomal interactions and fusion transcripts that are otherwise difficult to visualize
from next—generation sequencing data.

1 Introduction

 

Circos plot (Krzywinski et (11., 2009) has been widely used in gen—
omics research, especially in conjunction with next—generation
sequencing to detect genomic rearrangements and gene fusions
(Hagege et (11., 2007; Maher et (11., 2009). Circos is a plotting tool
that was developed in the Perl language. However, there are limita—
tions to Circos, some of which are inherent in Perl computer lan—
guage, such as the complexity of installation, i.e. many Perl
packages have to be installed. Furthermore, some packages are
version sensitive, making it difficult even for bioinformaticians to
install. Because Circos plot has the difficult task of representing the
whole genome length as a circular diagram (e.g. N3 billion

nucleotides in the human genome), there is no way to accurately de—
termine the genes and/or loci that each line represents in the Circos
plot. Thus, it is advantageous to have a Circos plot with mouse
hover function that provides information for specific data points.
The recently developed Circlize (Gu et (11., 2014), OmicCircos (Hu
et (11., 2014), ggbio (Yin et (11., 2012) and RCircos (Zhang et (11.,
2013) are R language versions of Circos. They are much easier to
import R—generated data into Circos, but it has the same limitations,
such as lack of interactive functionality.

In this article, we provide an interactive visualization Circos plot
tool that only requires Java installation, which is typically installed
on most computers. The input data are in tab—delimited format.

Fig. 1. (a) User interface ofJ-Circos. A circle chromosome band concatenated
by hg19 chromosome sizes is the default plot. Users can change genome, cir-
cle size and its origin in the command line. There are also other data types
(Circos-wiggle, bridge, label, text, cytogenetic and UCSC wiggle). Users can
input data from files (click ‘file') or copy/paste into the textbox. Click ‘load file'
or ‘draw' to plot the inputted data. (b) Types of Circos-wiggle pictures. Four
pictures in the left hand side are generated by setting the data column ‘filled'
to ‘false'. The circle picture was generated setting the wiggle range from 0 to
whole size. Arcs are generated by setting identical ‘height1' and ‘height2' val-
ues. (c) Circos bridge is drawn as a parabola. c is the constant in the quadratic

Users can either import data through text files or copy/paste in the
interface from MS Excel sheets.

2 Features

J—Circos is mainly used for genome visualization. Multiple concen—
tric circles can be used to show different types of genomic informa—
tion, such as expression level (wiggle plots), and gene fusions and
chromosome conformation capture data (bridge plots) (Fig. 1a).
J—Circos uses widely accepted UCSC genome browser data formats,
such as bigWig, bigBed, bedgraph and Bed format. J—Circos also
uses a new data type called Circos wiggle that is an extended wiggle
data type that can construct more complex visual objects. J—Circos
also uses another type called Circos bridge for visualizing genomic
translocation and gene fusions. J—Circos also has interactive func—
tions such as zoom in/out and mouse hover display, and circos
tracks can be loaded dynamically.

3 Data structure

The outermost circle in J—Circos represents the chromosomes
(Fig. 1a), which are concatenated according to the chromosomal
sizes listed in the chromosome size file. All chromosome loci in the
data file are converted into an angle degree. Data are represented in
J—Circos as outlined in Figure 1a. The data format for J—Circos are
arranged in columns for (i) color, which is entered as three integer
numbers separated by commas, (RGB), (ii) chromosome, which
should be consistent with the chromosome size file, (iii) start

nucleotide position, (iv) length, which corresponds to the thickness
of UCSC—bigWig/bedgraph/Circos—wiggle/Circos—bridge lines and (v)
description, which is the information for mouse hover display.
Further details on the data format can be found in Supplementary
file 51 and file 52.

The seven major features of J—Circos plot are:

(1) Circos—wiggle plots: This is typically used to show expression lev—
els at genomic loci. In J—Circos, this is shown as a box located on
a base line that is defined by height1 and height2 as shown in
Figure 1a. Of note, the height value of wiggle plots can be either
positive or negative values, and these are displayed above or
below the base line, respectively. Furthermore, if the wiggle
height1 value is zero, then the wiggle plot is drawn on the base
line. Another important column is ‘filled’, which provides an op—
tion to draw an empty wiggle. Many different types of shapes for
wiggle tracks as shown in Figure 1b.

(2) Circos—bridge plots: As mentioned, bridge tracks are used to dis—
play connections of two chromosomal loci (e.g. from fusion
genes or chromosome conformation capture data) in J—Circos.
J—Circos uses the following parabolic curve formula to draw
these bridges:

yzax2+c,

c is the distance from the top of the parabolic curve to the line
that connects the two roots of the inner or outer curve. We set c to
two—thirds of the distance from the origin to the line that connects
the two roots of the innermost or outermost curve, so that we can
induce a : —c/w2, where w is half of the width of the two roots of
the innermost or outermost curve. This is illustrated in Figure 1c.

(3) Label: Labels are used to annotate specific data points in
J—Circos. Labels are displayed perpendicular to a baseline as

shown in Figure 1a.

(4) Text: Text is used to annotate J—Circos plots. The text feature is
distinct from the ‘label’ feature as the ‘text’ feature is intended
for purposes such as titles for circos—wiggle/UCSC—wiggle or
Circos—bridge tracks. The two types of orientation for text plot—
ting are (a) tangent or (b) perpendicular (Fig. 1a), and it is deter—
mined by column ‘type’ (Supplementary file 51).

(5) Cytogenetic: This feature shows G—band gene density. J—Circos
uses the data format from the UCSC genome browser (Meyer
et (11., 2013). J—Circos requires a value.txt and cytogenetic file to
display cytogenetic bands. The value.txt file contains the g—band
value information, and the cytogenetic file contains the chromo—
some ranges corresponding to giesma staining.

(6) USCS bigWig/bedgraph: The data format is simple: chromosome,
nucleotide start position, nucleotide end position and value inte—
ger corresponding to expression level. This expression value
can be positive or negative, corresponding to either the plus or
minus strand, respectively. Of note, bigWig is uploaded more
efficiently.

(7) UCSC bigBed/Bed: bigBed/Bed files have three columns (chromo—
some name, start, end) and nine optional columns. The exons
will be displayed along the circle. Because Circos plots typically
represent a massive scale, the whole transcript is consequently
displayed as a line.

4 Summary

In this article, we introduce J—Circos, which not only covers most
functions of the original Circos tool, but also provides an interactive
function which provides further detail for specific data points using

the zoom function and mouse hovering over these data points.
However, unlike the original Circos that needs installation of other
packages, J—Circos does not require installation of any third party
package. Furthermore, J—Circos has a very user—friendly interface
and can produce complex figures with a few clicks. Thus, we pro—
pose that J—Circos is an easy—to—use tool that is also readily accessible
for biologists with limited bioinformatics skills. All data are kept in
ﬂat text file and users can also copy/paste data from MS excel files
directly into J—Circos.

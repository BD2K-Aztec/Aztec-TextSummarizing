ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing affords an efficient analysis
of transposon insertion libraries, which can be used to identify essen-
tial genes in bacteria. To analyse this high-resolution data, we present
a formal Bayesian framework for estimating the posterior probability of
essentiality for each gene, using the extreme-value distribution to
characterize the statistical significance of the longest region lacking
insertions within a gene. We describe a sampling procedure based on
the Metropolis—Hastings algorithm to calculate posterior probabilities
of essentiality while simultaneously integrating over unknown internal
parameters.

Results: Using a sequence dataset from a transposon library for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we show that this Bayesian approach
predicts essential genes that correspond well with genes shown to
be essential in previous studies. Furthermore, we show that by using
the extreme-value distribution to characterize genomic regions lacking
transposon insertions, this method is capable of identifying essential
domains within genes. This approach can be used for analysing trans-
poson libraries in other organisms and augmenting essentiality predic-
tions with statistical confidence scores.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transposon mutagenesis is a frequently used laboratory method
for determining essential genes in bacterial organisms. Essential
genes are those genes necessary for growth under a wide variety
of environmental conditions. Knowledge of essential genes is
important for the discovery of new antibacterial drugs because
these genes are potential targets for inhibitors (Hasan et al.,
2006). One way of determining essential genes is to identify
regions of the genome in which insertional mutations produce
non-Viable cells. To do this, a high-density library of transposon

mutants is constructed. The synthetic transposons used in
these studies are small fragments of DNA (typically 172kb),
which can be inserted into different locations in the chromosome
through the action of a distally encoded transposase enzyme
(Hayes, 2003). For example, derivatives of the Himar] trans-
poson are widely used and have been characterized to insert
at arbitrary TA dinucleotides without any other obvious se-
quence speciﬁcity bias (Lampe et al., 1996; Rubin et al., 1999).
The total number of TA sites within a gene often varies ~1(%100
sites depending on gene length and GC content. When a trans-
poson inserts at one of these TA sites within a gene, it presum-
ably disrupts the function of the gene. In a large library of
transposon insertion mutants, genes harbouring insertions are
presumed to be non-essential. Genes lacking insertions may be es-
sential, as they cannot tolerate disruption; however, this depends
on the size of gene and degree of saturation of the library
(Lamichhane et al., 2003). Typically, 1&15% of open reading
frames (ORFs) in a bacterial genome are found to be essential
(Gerdes et al., 2003), including genes involved in core metabol-
ism, cell-wall biosynthesis, protein translation and DNA replica-
tion (all of which are known targets of existing drugs).
Differential analysis of essential genes in bacteria passaged
through a host could be used to identify genes speciﬁcally
required for infection (Sassetti and Rubin, 2003).

In the original implementation, the location of transposon
insertions in individual mutants was read out Via microarray hy-
bridization. A primer-extension step, using a primer complimen-
tary to one end of the transposon, was used to amplify the adjacent
genomic region, and the relative abundance of these nucleic acid
probes was quantiﬁed Via hybridization to oligonucleotide repre-
senting each gene (Sassetti et al., 2003). Both the resolution and
the quantitative accuracy of this method were limited. More re-
cently, use of hybridization to analyse transposon libraries has
been replaced by deep sequencing using next-generation sequen-
cers, which yield millions of short reads (typically 507100 bp).
Mapping of reads ampliﬁed from transposon boundaries can
give precise coordinates of insertions within the genome
(Gawronski et al., 2009; Grifﬁn et al., 2011; Langridge et al.,
2009). The high-resolution data afforded by deep sequencing pre-
sent some unique challenges for analysis of gene essentiality.
It has previously been observed that even essential genes can tol-
erate transposon insertions in the extreme N— and C-termini of the

ORF (Akerley et al., 1998; Christen et al., 201 1; Smith et al., 1996).
Previous analyses have often used an ad hoc criterion, such as
exclusion of insertions in the ﬁrst/last $20% of the coding
region (Gawronski et al., 2009). For similar reasons, insertions
are sometimes tolerated in linker regions between domains, or
one domain but not another of an essential protein
(Lamichhane et al., 2005). For example, transposon insertions in
the N—terminus of Mmp15 caused attenuation of infection in
mouse lungs, whereas insertions in the C-terminus did not
(Lamichhane et al., 2005). Thus, it is inaccurate to assume that
only genes completely lacking transposon insertions are essential.

In previous work, we described a novel statistical method for
analysing transposon insertion data to characterize the essential-
ity of genes within an organism (Grifﬁn et al., 2011). The method
was based on identifying the longest consecutive stretch of TA
sites lacking insertions in a gene and estimating the likelihood of
such an open region occurring by chance through the extreme-
Value (Gumbel) distribution. This model was based on an ana-
logy to runs of tails in a sequence of coin tosses, where each TA
site is Viewed as an independent Bernoulli trial given the back-
ground insertion frequency in non-essential genes. This analysis
was shown to correlate well with previous characterizations of
genes essential for in vitro growth of M ycobacterium tuberculosis.
The primary advantage of this method is that essentiality is based
on statistically signiﬁcant stretches of TA sites lacking insertions,
regardless of the presence of insertions at other regions within the
gene. This is in contrast to other models, such as a multinomial
model, where the order of insertions is not taken into consider-
ation (Blades and Broman, 2002), and it may miss regions char-
acteristic of essential domains. One limitation of our previous
method is that it depends on an a priori estimate of the insertion
frequency in non-essential genes. Although this can be approxi-
mated (over all TA sites in the whole genome) or tuned itera-
tively (by separating out essential genes), a more rigorous
statistical treatment is desirable.

One possible way to approximate the parameters of this
model and find estimates of essentiality is to use the expect-
ation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Although the EM algo-
rithm converges relatively quickly, it depends on maximizing
the likelihood of the given distribution. This is not feasible for
the product of Gumbel distributions, as no closed-form expres-
sion for the derivative exists.

In this article, we present a formal Bayesian analysis of trans-
poson insertion data that simultaneously estimates the likelihood
of essentiality for each gene and the non-insertion frequency for
each class, given in the data. We develop a formula for the joint
and conditional densities based on the likelihood for each gene.
We describe how to use a MetropolisiHastings (MH) sampling
procedure to estimate the parameters from the data, by sampling
from the joint probability densities. This method produces a
formal estimate of essentiality for each gene from the posterior
probability given the observed insertion data, marginalizing over
the unknown insertion frequencies in essential and non-essential
genes.

2 METHODS

The sequence data obtained from transposon mutagenesis experiments
consist of a set of reads mapping to TA dinucleotides sites within

the genome. The read counts at each TA site are discretized to a binary
value of 1 (‘insertion’) or 0 (‘non-insertion’) depending on the presence or
absence of transposon reads mapping to those locations. Although the
number of reads mapping to a location may contain useful additional
information about essentiality, it can also be subject to variability because
of phenomena such as polymerase chain reaction bias. Thus, we take the
presence/absence of insertions within genes to be sufﬁcient for identifying
essential regions in our model. TA sites are assumed to be independent
from each other and treated as a set of Bernoulli trials (analogous to
coin-tossing, with insertions and non-insertions representing outcomes
of tails or heads), which is a reasonable assumption in non-essential
genes, where the probability of insertion at adjacent sites is thought to
be independent.

From these data, we obtain the maximum number of consecutive TA
sites lacking insertions within the genes and the number of nucleotides
spanned by this sequence. Although the geometric distribution governs
the distribution of the number of non-insertions observed in a row, the
Gumbel (extreme-value distribution) can be used to characterize the long-
est run of non-insertions observed in a gene. The Gumbel distribution
serves as a likelihood function for non-essential genes, as the longest
runs of non-insertion should follow what we expect given the global
non-insertion frequency. On the other hand, essential genes, whose max-
imum runs of non-insertions should be longer than expected, are instead
modelled through a normalized sigmoid function. This likelihood function
reﬂects the fact that any gene can be essential (with more or less uniform
probability), except those genes with spans of non-insertion that are too
small to represent a domain. Using this model of the data, we derive pos-
terior densities for the essentiality of each gene and use the MH algorithm
to obtain an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sample of values of
these densities from which to estimate their posterior probabilities.

2.1 Bayesian mixture model

Let Y,- = {nh r,-,s,-} represent our observations for the ith gene for
i = 1...G, where n,- represents the total number of TA sites, r,- represent
the longest run of non-insertions observed and s,- represents the span
of nucleotides of the longest run of non-insertions. Each gene is modelled
as coming from one of two classes, 1 and 0, representing essential
and non-essential genes, respectively. The complete set of essentiality as-
signments is represented by the latent variable Z = (Z1,Z2, ...Zg>
(Boolean vector), with the essentiality assignment of an individual
ith gene represented by the Boolean variable Zi, which takes on binary
values of 1 and 0 for the two possible classes. We assume a Bernoulli
probability, (1)0, that governs probability of non-insertion across
non-essential genes. Finally, a) 2 (col, mg), the mixing coefﬁcient, repre-
sents the prevalence of essential and non-essential genes within the mix-
ture (with mo 2 1 — col).

2. 1.1 Likelihood for non-essential genes The data, Y,, for each gene
consist of observations r,- and s,-, representing the maximum run of
non-insertions (TA sites without insertions) in a row, and the number
of nucleotides spanned by this gap of non-insertions. The joint likelihood
of these observations is

[7(ri,Sr|Zr = 0,120,601) =I7(rilZ = 0,120,601) XI7(Si|rr, Z = 0,120,601)

To the likelihood of observing a maximum run of non-insertions, r,,
is modelled through the Gumbel distribution:

where z = 7”, and m and r are the location and scale parameters,
respectively, of the underlying distribution. In analogy to coin-tossing,
these parameters are functions of the probability of non-insertion, (1)0,
and of the total number of trials, n, derived by determining the expected

Note that the expected length of the maximum run of non-insertions
increases logarithmically with n (the total number of TA sites in the gene).
As r,- and s,- are highly correlated (Fig. 1), we model their dependence as
linear-Gaussian, with covariance matrix 2 = [013,033], [Whoa] esti-
mated a priori from empirical data:

p(s,-ir,-. Z = 0.¢o.w1) ~ N(s.- — Am, a?) (3)

were A, and a, are the parameters of the normal distribution, derived
from the linear-Gaussian relationship (i.e. A, = :4) observed in the data.

The joint likelihood of the observations at non-essential genes is
therefore:

17(ri,Si|Zi = 0,¢0,w1)= Gumbel(ri; 7", T) X N(Si — Am, 03) (4)

2.1.2 Likelihood for essential genes We model the likelihood at
essential genes based on a sigmoid function that is uniform as long as the
gene contains a gap that is as large as a typical protein domain, as a gap
could be any size, even as large as the entire ORF. Using this likelihood
allows our method to disambiguate those cases where the run of
non-insertions actually represents a smaller or larger segment of the
genome than suggested by the number of consecutive TA sites without
insertions.

[7(ri,Sr|Zr=1,¢0,w1)=I7(Si|Z=1,¢0,w1)XI7(riISr,Z =1,¢0,w1)

The number of nucleotides spanned by a given run on non-insertions,
s,-, is modelled by a normalized sigmoid (logistic) function:

C

17(SiIZi = 1) = 9(Si; 3) = 

(5)
where 8 is the mean number of nucleotides spanned by an average protein
domain, K is equal to 0.1 and C is normalization constant. Previous
studies of the length of domains within proteins have found the average
size to be ~100 amino acids or 300 bp (Wheelan et al., 2000). Using this
threshold for 8, the likelihood of observing a given span s,- is more or less
uniform, except it is near 0 if the longest run of non-insertions spans
less than ~300 bp. Supplementary Figure S2 shows how sensitive the
model is to the these parameters.

As with non-essential genes, the likelihood of observing a span of
nucleotides r,- given s,- is modelled through a linear-Gaussian dependence
similar to Equation (3), but with an inverse relationship [i.e.

N(r,- — Asshazﬂ. The joint likelihood of the observations at essential

s

genes is, therefore,
[7(ri,Si|Zi = 1,1250, ml) = 9(Si) X N(ri — Aisha?) (6)

2.1.3 Prior distributions Our previous expectation for the probability
of non-insertion at non-essential genes, (1)0, is represented by a beta
distribution, with hyper-parameters a0 and ,80:

mo) = Betauso; «0.150) = Warm — W“

The previous probability of an individual essentiality assignment, Zi,
depends on the probability that the ith gene is essential or non-essential;
therefore, it is characterized by a Bernoulli distribution with that
depends on col:

n(Z,-|w1) = Bemoulli(Z,-; L01) = w1’(1 — wol’zi

Similarly, the previous probability of an essentiality assignment for
all genes, Z is a product of Bernoulli trials with probability col:

G
11(le1) = H Bernoulli(w1) = wfza — w1)GTK~'

where G is the total number of genes and K, is the sum of the binary
vector of essentiality assignments (i.e. KZ = 2Z1). Finally, our previous
expectations for the mixing coefﬁcient col are given by a beta distribution:

1“(05w + 13w) awil

77(601) = Beta(w1;awa;8w) = Wan (1 — 600271

2.1.4 Joint distribution To derive the posterior probability density
functions necessary for our Bayesian inferences of essentiality, we ﬁrst
deﬁne the full joint distribution, p(Z, Y, (1)0, ml). The full joint distribution
is equal to the product of the data-likelihood and the previous
expectations for the variables: p(Z, Y, (1)0, col) = p( Y|Z, (1)0, w1)p(¢>0)
p(Z|w1) p(w1). We assume independence among genes; therefore, the like-
lihood can be written as a product of the observations over individual
genes:

2.1.5 Conditional distributions Using the full joint probability (7),
we derive a conditional distribution for the probability of non-insertion
at non-essential genes, (1)0, using proportionality to cancel out those
parameters that are constant with respect to (1)0:

I7(¢o| Y, 2,601) 0917(le (20,601) X 77020) X 77(le1) X 77(601)

Similarly, we derive a conditional distribution for the individual essen-
tiality values Zi, specifying both possible essentiality assignments (i.e.
Z,-=1 and Z,- = 0):

17(Zi = llY, ZH), (1’0, wl)

2.2 Metropolis—Hastings sampling

We wish to obtain posterior estimates of essentiality for all genes, inte-
grating over possible values of the unknown variables (e.g. (1)0). To
accomplish this, we generate a Markov chain Monte-Carlo sample of
values from the conditional densities of interest. By sampling from
these conditional densities, we can obtain posterior estimates of essenti-
ality, Z,-, without having to know or calculate the probability of non-
insertions, (1)0, before hand; effectively integrating over this parameter.

Because the conditional distribution of Z,- admits only two possible
outcomes (i.e. essential and non-essential), this density can be sampled
from a Bernoulli distribution with outcomes proportional to the normal-
ized conditional probability (9, 10):

2? ~ Bernoulli(—p1 )
171 +170
[71 =I7(ri,Sr|Z(7r), (1’0) X 601

I70 =I7(ri,Sr|Z(7r), (1’0) X (1 — 601)

However, the posterior distribution for the parameter (1)0 (8) is the
product of multiple Gumbel distributions and a Beta distribution,
which are not conjugate with each other and cannot be easily sampled.
To sample from this posterior density, we use a random-walk MH algo-
rithm. The MH algorithm is capable of sampling from arbitrary distri-
butions of interest by proposing new candidate values from a Gaussian
distribution centred on the last accepted value, (pg’l), with small variance,
v, and accepting or rejecting candidate values probabilistically. Algorithm
1 presents the sampling scheme used to sample the posterior densities
of (1)0 and Z,-. An MH step is taken to sample (1)0, and then we sample
Z,- for each gene.

After the samples of parameter value, (1)0, and essentiality assignments,

over the ﬁnal sample, minus a burn-in stage to ensure the sampling pro-
cedure has mixed well.

3 RESULTS

We applied our method to deep-sequencing data from
transposon-insertion libraries of the H37RV strain of
M. tuberculosis. The full details of the construction of this library
are presented in Grifﬁn et al. (2011). Brieﬂy, the libraries were
prepared by transforming H37RV using the MycoMarT7 phage,
leading to ~105 independent insertion events. Colony forming
units were inoculated into 200ml of minimal media and 0.1%
glycerol and grown at 370C. The libraries were sequenced
with an Illumina GAII sequencer and a read length of 36 bp
(G8 million reads per library).

The H37RV genome has 4411654bp, and it contains 3989
ORFs (Cole et al., 1998). This equates to an average of 15.9
TA sites per ORF, spaced ~61bp apart on average. Reads
from two independent libraries were obtained, which were
then summed together to achieve a higher sampling density of
the TA sites. Of the 74 605 total TA sites in the genome, 38 984
(53.12%) had reads mapping to them, showing evidence of
a transposon insertion at those locations. Of these insertion
sites, 32 701 of them occurred within ORFs. We assume that
sites with a small number of reads (i.e. one) could represent
spurious reads possibly because of sequencing errors; therefore,
those sites were treated as lacking any insertions. However,
Supplementary Figure S9 shows the read counts ﬁt an overdis-
persed Poisson distribution, suggesting most are legitimate inser-
tions. Sites with just one insertion are discarded anyway to
be safe, requiring insertions to be confirmed by at least two
reads. This might lower the effective density of the dataset; how-
ever, this does not affect the method. Of the 3989 ORFs
in H37RV, 41 do not contain any TA sites. An additional set
of 237 genes were deemed too short because of the fact that
they do not contain enough TA sites (i.e n,-<3), or the span of
nucleotides was too short (i.e. s,-<150bp). Therefore, a total of
278 genes are reported as ‘no-data’ because our analysis is not
appropriate for these genes.

The sampling procedure was run for 50 000 iterations, provid-
ing estimates of essentiality for all Viable genes, as well as esti-
mates of the parameter (150. To ensure that the algorithm mixed
well and the samples obtained were uncorrelated, the first 1000
samples were treated as a ‘burn-in’ period and discarded; only
keeping every 20th sample after there. Supplementary Section S2
contains an analysis of the convergence of the MH procedure
used. The value for $0 (non-insertion frequency in non-essential
genes) was estimated to be 0.290:l:0.004 (SD). Performance
on a lower-density dataset, also H37RV grown on glycerol,
is described in Supplementary Section S3. This lower-density
library contains fewer transposon insertions in coding regions
[i.e. 23 399 (36.3%) compared with 31 715 (50.4%) in the library
described earlier in the text], and it has longer runs of
non-insertions among the genes ((150 = 0.592). Rather than pre-
dicting more essential genes, our analysis is more conservative
in its predictions, as it is less conﬁdent of the essentiality of the
genes given the sparsity of the insertions.

Bayesian analysis of gene essentiality

 

3.1 Essentiality results

After obtaining the sample from the MH procedure, the poster-
ior probability of essentiality for all genes is estimated by
averaging over the sample of essentiality values, Z,. To set sig-
niﬁcance thresholds while correcting for multiple comparisons
(i.e. to control false discovery rate, FDR), we use a method
described by Muller et al. (2006), which emulates the
BenjaminiiHochberg procedure for Bayesian posterior probabil-
ities. Limiting the FDR at 0.05, genes with Z,<0.0371 are clas-
sified as non-essential, and genes with Z,>0.9902 are classiﬁed
as essential. Supplementary Table S1 contains our predictions for
all 3989 ORFs in H37RV. In total, 667 genes are categorized as
essential, and 2693 are non-essential by this criterion. These in-
clude genes experimentally validated to be essential for growth
in vitro [i.e. prrA and prrB (Haydel et al., 2012), phoP (Goyal
et al., 2011) and mshA and mshC (Buchmeier and Fahey, 2006]
and genes known to be non-essential [i.e. rpfA (Kana et al.,
2008), glnD (Read et al., 2007), echA5 and fadB3 (Williams
et al., 2011)]. The remaining genes represent those for which
the method is unable to reach an essentiality assignment with
conﬁdence. Figure 2 shows a cumulative plot of the Z,- values
for all the genes, with the horizontal lines representing the thresh-
olds of essentiality and non-essentiality. To assess the sensitivity
of this result to the ﬁxed parameters in the likelihood function for
essential genes, we obtained results for different values of 8 and K
parameters of the sigmoid function. Supplementary Figure S2
shows a cumulative plot of Z,- Values for different combinations
of these parameters. The K parameter has little effect on the ﬁnal
result. On the other hand, a 2-fold increase and decrease of the
8 parameter signiﬁcantly changes the slope of the graph as well as
the number of non-essential genes estimated. This is consistent
with the fact that the 8 parameter represents the expected span of
nucleotides for essential domains. This has been empirically
determined to be ~300 nt.

maximum runs of non-insertion (17.57) than non-essential
genes, and these runs spanned a larger number of nucleotides
(1039.81 bp), which is consistent with our expectations for essen-
tiality. Non-essential genes contained a larger number of inser-
tions on average (15.69). Although essential genes contained only
a small number of insertions (1.68), this number was greater than
zero, indicating that the method is capable of detecting essential
genes with a small number of insertions, provided they contain a
long enough run of non-insertions suggestive of an essential
region.

3.2 Concordance with previous results

The essentiality of the entire M. tuberculosis H37RV genome has
been characterized previously using transposon-site hybridiza-
tion (Sassetti and Rubin, 2003; Sassetti et al., 2003). We compare
our essentiality inferences with previous results to verify that our
method achieves results that are consistent with expectations of
the essentiality in M .tuberculosis. Sassetti et al. used transposon-
site hybridization (TraSH) to characterize the genes necessary
for optimal growth in vitro, for a library of transposon mutants
grown on 0.02% glucose and rich-media (7H10). Although our
method analyses deep sequencing of transposon libraries, TraSH
uses hybridization of gene-speciﬁc probes to quantify the level of
ﬂuorescence being emitted by hybridization probes to determine
which genes are being interrupted in the library of mutants.
Table 2 contains a comparison between the two methods.

Sassetti et al. also included an additional category of genes rep-
resenting those whose interruption causes growth defects (i.e.
slower growth); our method does not make this distinction.
Excluding these, the two methods show agreement in 69.9% of
essentials and 84.6% of non-essentials for 81.7% genes across
both categories. There were only 81 genes predicted to be essential
by TraSH but not by our method; 94 genes predicted to be
non-essential by TraSH but found to be essential by our method.

Some of these differences could be due to the different growth
conditions of the libraries. For example, because our library was
grown on glycerol, we ﬁnd genes necessary for glycerol metab-
olism as essential, such as GlpK (glycerol kinase). Other differ-
ences may be due to incomplete sequence coverage (e.g. gaps
in PE_PGRS genes, which are highly GC-rich and hard to
sequence). Two of the 62 PE_PGRS genes in the H37RV
genome were classiﬁed as essential by our model because of
large regions without insertions, although genes in this family
are generally believed to be non-essential (Banu et al., 2002).
Overrepresentation of PE_PGRS gene among essentials was
also noted in other transposon library analyses using sequencing
(Lamichhane et al., 2003).

One notable difference is that Sassetti et al. found gch to be
non-essential; however, the insertion pattern shown in Figure 3
clearly indicates that this gene was unable to tolerate insertions in
the libraries of mutants analysed. Gch encodes for malate
synthase in M.tuberculosis, which was originally thought to be
necessary only for growth on fatty acids as part of a glyoxylate
shunt aVIcKinney et al., 2000), but it has recently been shown
to be essential on other carbon sources like dextrose by chemical
inhibition (Krieger et al., 2012). A complete absence of trans-
poson insertions in RV1837c was also observed in the
DeADMAn studies (Lamichhane et al., 2003). Our data suggest
that Gch is also essential for growth on glycerol (in liquid cul-
ture with minimal media), showing a significant run of
non-insertions (25 of 277spanning 2078 nt, p(Z,- = 1): 1.0).
It should be noted that in the original TraSH data, Gch had
a hybridization ratio of 0.41, which was near the threshold for
essentiality (<0.20).

3.3 Comparison with other statistical models

In contrast to other models where the order of insertions does
not matter, the Gumbel distribution is capable of identifying
regions lacking insertions within genes that are signiﬁcantly
longer than expected, despite the presence of insertions elsewhere

in the gene. Models of essentiality that focus solely on the pro-
portion of insertions or the number of reads within genes may
miss these essential regions if enough insertions are observed
elsewhere within the gene.

To evaluate this important distinction, we compare our
method with the method proposed by Blades and Broman
(2002). This method does not take the order of insertions into
consideration, but instead it is based on a multinomial likelihood
function that characterizes the number of mutants with inser-
tions unique to a gene, as well the number of mutants with in-
sertions that occur in regions that overlap with adjacent genes
(which adds uncertainty as to which gene was disrupted). Using
this multinomial likelihood, Blades and Broman implement a
Gibbs sampling procedure that estimates posterior probabilities
of essentiality for all the genes.

We obtained the R package ‘negenes’, which contains the im-
plementation of this method maintained by Karl W. Broman
(http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/kbroman/software/). The Gibbs
sampler was run on the same H37RV glycerol dataset analysed
earlier in the text, for 50 000 iterations. The ﬁrst 1000 samples were
ignored as part of the bum-in period, and only every 22th sample
was kept to remove any auto-correlation in the sampling process.
Following Lamichhane et al. (2003), we used the number of inser-
tions within the N-terminal 80% of the ORF, as representative of
the number of Viable mutants with insertions in genes.

After obtaining the probability of essentiality from the Gibbs
sampler, we set thresholds for essentiality by correcting for mul-
tiple comparisons and controlling the false discovery rate as
we did for the Gumbel method (implementing a procedure
analogous to the one proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg).
We use these thresholds to classify the genes as essential,
non-essential or uncertain.

The Blades and Broman method predicts 244 essential genes
and 3195 non-essential genes. As the small number of essential
genes could be due to the selected threshold, a less conservative
threshold for essentiality (posterior probability >0.95) results
in 458 genes being predicted as essential, still well below
the 614 essential genes characterized by Sassetti et al. (2003).
A full breakdown of the results is found in Supplementary
Table S5.

The lower number of essentials predicted by the Blades and
Broman method is due to the fact that the presence of even a few
insertions in a gene (i.e. 3 1) is enough to make it seem
non-essential under this multinomial model. For example,
GyrB ()3 subunit of DNA gyrase), a known essential gene and
target of ﬂuoroquinolones, is found to be non-essential by the
Blades and Broman method, as it is observed to have insertions
at the N-terminus. In contrast, our method ﬁnds GyrB to be
essential, as it contains a signiﬁcant stretch of TA sites lacking
any insertions (40 consecutive TA sites lacking insertions of
43 TA sites in the gene), which is what we would expect from
an essential gene. Although this could be potentially overcome
by ignoring insertions at the ends of the N- and C- termini (e. g.
considering only 5780% of the coding region as recommended by
Gawronski et al., 2009), a strength of our model is that it does
not need to discard these regions a priori.

The dataset was also analysed with the ESSENTIALS soft-
ware, which uses a negative binomial distribution to analyse read
counts within each gene (Zomer et al., 2012). ESSENTIALS only

Bayesian analysis of gene essentiality

 

predicts 434 genes in the H37RV genome to be essential (using
a —8.13-fold change cut-off determined by the software) and
3363 genes to be non-essential. Thus, similar to the Blades and
Broman method, the ESSENTIALS software also underpredicts
the number of essential genes compared with what is expected for
this organism (i.e. ~600, based on prior TraSH studies).
However, 93.5% of the genes predicted to be essential by the
ESSENTIALS software (406/434) overlap with the genes pre-
dicted to be essential by our Bayesian method, effectively repre-
senting a subset (60% of our 667). In all, 311 of the 434 genes
were correctly labelled as essential according to the original
TraSH experiments, capturing 50% of the 614 essential genes
previously characterized. The primary reason that other genes
that are believed to be essential are not identiﬁed as such by
the ESSENTIALS software seems to be because many of these
genes often contain some insertions at a few sites in the ORF
(such as at the N- and C- termini or in a non-essential domain);
thus their read counts are higher than expected for an essential
gene (according to their model).

3.4 Essential domains

One of the advantages of our method for analysing this high-
resolution transposon insertion data is that it can reveal essential
regions or domains within proteins. The regions devoid of inser-
tions detected by our method often correspond to well-defined
protein folding domains. To date, the X-ray crystallographic
structures of only 8.5% of proteins in H37RV have been deter-
mined (Ehebauer and Wilmanns, 2011). Thus, to test the model’s
ability to detect essential domains, we compare these regions
with Pfam predictions of protein domains within H37RV genes.
Pfam is able to make predictions of domains based on amino
acid sequence homology using hidden Markov models to repre-
sent protein families (Finn et al., 2010).

Using Pfam, we obtained predictions of 5091 protein domains,
1126 of which were in genes predicted to be essential by our
method. To determine whether the significant runs of
non-insertions observed coincide with protein domain bound-
aries, we calculated a ratio of overlap between the nucleotides
spanned by a maximum run of non-insertions and the do-
main boundaries predicted by Pfam (Table 3). For a Pfam
domain spanning coordinates i..j, if the closest matching re-
gion lacking insertions is k..l, then the overlap score is
min(|i — k|, [j — l|)/|i —j|. Of the 1126 domains found within
essential genes, 976 (86.68%) of them overlapped signiﬁcantly
(i.e. score >0.80) with the domain boundaries, suggesting that
the majority of Pfam domains are contained within the runs of
non-insertions observed. Another set of 104 domains (9.24%)

Essentials 1126 518.78 8.31 0.89

 

had no signiﬁcant overlap (i.e. score <0.20), potentially repre-
senting those domains that are within non-essential regions
of essential genes. The remaining 46 (4.08%) domains represent
those with an intermediate overlap (i.e. score between
0.20—0.80), representing a small set of genes for which the
Pfam boundary prediction may be inconsistent.

In some cases, the pattern of transposon insertions is capable
of identifying individual domains as essential through a sequence
of TA sites lacking insertions that closely matches the boundaries
of the predicted Pfam domain. To identify such cases, we
matched the Pfam domain predictions to the closest run of
non-insertions and calculated a consistency score that reﬂects
the consistency between the two regions. This consistency score
was based on comparing the distance (in nucleotides) between
the boundaries of the domain prediction i..j and the boundaries
of the run of non-insertions k..l. We restricted attention to genes
for which the run of non-insertions corresponding to the domain
is statistically signiﬁcant (P<0.05 using a cumulative Gumbel
distribution), and whose distance between boundaries (upstream
or downstream) is <50 bp (i.e. |i — k| + [j — l| <50). We identi-
ﬁed 95 known domains that were mostly devoid of transposon
insertions internally, but for which insertions were observed at
TA sites right near the boundaries (shown in Supplementary
Table S2). Many of these constitute essential single-domain pro-
teins, although several occur in larger multi-domain proteins
with both essential and non-essential regions. To identify genes
that contain both essential and non-essential domains, we se-
lected a subset of genes that are labelled as essential by our
Bayesian analysis, but for which there is still a relatively large
(i.e. #TAs >4) area remaining containing an insertion frequency
that is not signiﬁcantly essential (i.e. P—Value of >005) accord-
ing to the cumulative binomial distribution. This gave a set of 36
genes (presented in Supplementary Table S3) that represent inter-
esting cases where there is a combination of both essential and
non-essential regions.

Among the genes that our method identiﬁes as having both
essential and non-essential domains are RV3910 and RV0018c.
These two genes have been shown to be essential for growth in
mycobacteria and are involved in regulating cell wall (peptido-
glycan) synthesis. RV3910 encodes for two C-terminal protein
domains (an intracellular pseudokinase and an extracellular
sugar-binding domain) and an N-terminal MViN-like domain,
which is required for the late stages of peptidoglycan biosynthesis
(Fig. 4). MViN proteins have been proposed to be involved in the
export of the lipid-II precursor, and this Mtb orthologue is

regulated by a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with
FhaA (RV0020c) (Gee et al., 2012). Insertions in RV3910 are
found only in the C-terminal domains, but not the N-terminal
membrane domain, implying only the latter domain is necessary
for growth (p(Z,- = 1) = 1.00)), based on a run of 34 consecutive
non-insertions within its essential domain, spanning 1439 nt, as
signiﬁcant. This has been conﬁrmed experimentally by Gee et al.
(2012). Rv0018c (PstP: serine/threonine phosphatase) contains
an essential catalytic domain within its N-terminus (Fig. 5),
and it has been shown to dephosphorylate RV0020 (FhaA) coun-
teracting phosphorylation by PknB (Pullen et al., 2004). It con-
tains a run of 12 consecutive non-insertions in the N-terminal
catalytic domain, spanning 695 nt, which our method identiﬁes
as signiﬁcant [p(Z,- = 1) = 0.999)].

4 DBCUSﬁON

The availability of next-generation sequencing data for analysing
transposon mutagenesis libraries necessitates a new method cap-
able of analysing the high-resolution data and determining es-
sentiality. We developed a Bayesian statistical model that can be
used to analyse this data and make rigorous predictions about
the essentiality of individual genes, as well as identify stretches
of non-insertions indicative of essential domains. Using this
method, we have analysed sequence data from a library of mu-
tants of M.tuberculosis bacteria and found high concordance
with previous results.

The key insight in our method is the use of the Gumbel dis-
tribution to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of runs of
non-insertion that are significantly longer than expected, and,
therefore, indicative of essential regions. By highlighting these
essential regions, our method can help identify essential domains
within genes that might otherwise be missed by characterizing the
proportion of insertions alone. An approach based on analysing
the size of insertion gaps was suggested by Christen et al. (2011);
however, they used a simpler exponential model for assessing
statistical significance. Using our method, we found multiple
genes with essential domains that match Pfam predictions of
domains, and whose essentiality is supported in the literature
(e. g. Rv0018c and RV3910). Moreover, because our method de-
pends on consecutive sub-sequences of TA sites lacking inser-
tions, and not on the simple presence or absence of insertions
within a gene, our method is not sensitive to insertions at the N-
or C- terminus of a gene, which essential genes have been shown
to occasionally tolerate (Akerley et al., 1998; Christen et al.,
2011; Smith et al., 1996).

Although previous analyses have used deep-sequencing data
to determine essentiality, these have relied on ad hoc criteria to
ignore insertions at the N- or C- terminus or have made assump-
tions about parameters to quantify the conﬁdence of their essen-
tiality predictions. However, by using a Bayesian statistical
framework, our method can simultaneously estimate model par-
ameters and posterior probabilities of essentiality without requir-
ing a priori estimates of these unknown variables.

Although our method can successfully determine regions in
the genome that contain unusually long gaps lacking any inser-
tions, it does not take the number of reads observed at each site
into account (i.e. read counts). Our binary interpretation of the
insertion data is based on mere presence or absence of reads, and
it ignores any potential information that the number of reads
mapping to a particular site might bear. An alternative approach
based on quantifying read counts within genomic regions might
yield biologically relevant information on essentiality. For
example, in another article (Zhang et al., 2012), a model was
developed that calculates signiﬁcance scores for sums of read
counts at TA sites using a non-parametric test. This approach
yields qualitatively similar results to our model in terms of which
genes are classiﬁed as essential and non-essential. One advantage
of an approach based on read counts is that it could potentially
detect genes whose disruption leads to growth defects, in that
slower-growing mutants might produce fewer (but non-zero)
read in a disrupted gene compared with the expected value.
This was exploited to infer genes that play a role in cholesterol
catabolism by Grifﬁn et al. (2011). On the other hand, a single
overampliﬁed TA site in a region (with an excess of reads be-
cause of polymerase chain reaction bias) could lead to misinter-
pretation, whereas our model would be less sensitive to this kind
of noise.

The method we have presented can be used to assess essenti-
ality of genes, as well as intergenic (e.g. regulatory) regions and
assign statistical conﬁdence scores, in any organism, provided a
transposon mutant library can be constructed and sequenced.
Although mutant libraries analysed were constructed using the
Himar] transposon, this method could be used to analyse
libraries constructed using the Tn5 transposon, where every
nucleotide is a possible insertion site (Langridge et al., 2009).
By sampling the probability of non-insertion from its posterior
distribution, we can calculate estimates of essentiality for a
diversity of mutagenesis experiments.

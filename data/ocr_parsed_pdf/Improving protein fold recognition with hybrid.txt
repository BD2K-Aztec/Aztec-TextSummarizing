Abstract

 

Motivation: Template—based modeling, the most successful approach for predicting protein 3D
structure, often requires detecting distant evolutionary relationships between the target sequence
and proteins of known structure. Developed for this purpose, fold recognition methods use elabor—
ate strategies to exploit evolutionary information, mainly by encoding amino acid sequence into
profiles. Since protein structure is more conserved than sequence, the inclusion of structural infor—
mation can improve the detection of remote homology.

Results: Here, we present ORION, a new fold recognition method based on the pairwise compari—
son of hybrid profiles that contain evolutionary information from both protein sequence and struc—
ture. Our method uses the 16—state structural alphabet Protein Blocks, which provides an accurate
1D description of protein structure local conformations. ORION systematically outperforms PSI—
BLAST and HHsearch on several benchmarks, including target sequences from the modeling com—
petitions CASP8, 9 and 10, and detects ~10% more templates at fold and superfamily SCOP levels.

1 Introduction

Understanding how proteins adopt their 3D structure remains one of
the most challenging questions in science (Kennedy and Norman,
2005). The resolution of this problem would have a great impact on
various fields of biology and medicine, allowing, for example, the ra—
tional design of new protein functions and drug molecules. Despite
the progress made over the last decades, our biochemical knowledge
and computational power are still insufficient to accurately predict
protein structure solely from the amino acid sequence. Nevertheless,
on the basis of the evolutionary relationship that many proteins share,
it is possible to model the structure of a target protein using, as a tem—
plate, a related protein of known structure. This approach, called
comparative modeling, is currently the most successful in constructing

theoretical models of protein structures. Since the quality of the result—
ing structure prediction largely depends on the template protein se—
lected, the initial step of homology detection is crucial in comparative
modeling. When proteins share >30% sequence identity, evolutionary
relationships can be found using simple pairwise sequence comparison
methods (Brenner et (11., 1998): heuristic such as BLAST (Altschul
et (11., 1990) or optimal such as SSEARCH (Pearson, 1991). However,
in the case of non—obvious relationships below the ‘twilight zone’ of
20—35% sequence identity between the target and the template (Rost,
1999), fold recognition methods have been proposed to find related
proteins for template—based modeling.

Early methods of remote homology detection were based on pro—
file—to—sequence comparison (Gribskov et (11., 1987). A profile can

be represented as a position—specific scoring matrix (PSSM) encoded
from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of related proteins and,
therefore, contains evolutionary information specific to a protein
family and defined by the levels of residue conservation at each se—
quence position. The first profile—to—sequence algorithm proposed
by Henikoff and Henikoff (1994), and the widely used PSI—BLAST
(Altschul et (11., 1997), were followed by methods derived from the
probabilistic interpretation of profiles using hidden Markov models
(profile HMMs) (Krogh et (11., 1994), like SAM—T98 (Karplus et (11.,
1998) or HMMER (Eddy, 1998), which improved both the align—
ment quality and the sensitivity/specificity of detection. Compared
with sequence—to—sequence alignment, profiles and profile HMMs
greatly improved identification of distantly related proteins and,
consequently, comparative modeling (Muller et (11., 1999; Park
et (11., 1998). Fold recognition was later taken to a new level with
the FFAS method (Rychlewski et (11., 2000), which was based on
profile—profile alignment. By using profiles for both target and
template, such methods fully exploit the transitivity of sequence
homology, making them more sensitive and specific than profile—t0—
sequence comparisons (Ohlson et (11., 2004; Panchenko, 2003).
Finally, the pairwise profile HMM comparison introduced with the
HHsearch algorithm (Soding, 2005) has further pushed the bounda—
ries of remote homology detection and provided one of the current
best approach for protein fold recognition.

Besides these methods solely based on sequence, some authors
have proposed structure—based fold recognition methods called
‘threading’ (Bowie et (11., 1991; Jones et (11., 1992). The principle of
threading is to assess the compatibility between the target sequence
(1D) and different solved protein structures (3D) by using know—
ledge—based scoring functions. Thus, comparative modeling may still
be achieved by using templates sharing no detectable homology with
the target sequence, since proteins may be structurally similar, even
without detectable evolutionary relationship between their se—
quences. Despite interesting success, these 1D—3D methods are lim—
ited by the quality of the sequence—to—structure alignment and do
not reach the accuracy of the most advanced purely sequence—based
methods (McGuffin, 2008).

Following the success of both sequence— and structure—based fold
recognition methods, combined approaches have emerged. Indeed,
structural information from solvent accessibility, secondary struc—
ture or backbone torsion angle can be used to improve sequence—
based fold recognition. Such structural features have the advantage
of being predictable, which addresses the absence of experimental
model for the target protein. Thus, several methods combining dis—
crete structural descriptors with amino acid sequence information
have been proposed (Kelley et (11., 2000; Shi et (11., 2001). Given that
structural cores change less rapidly, between 3 and 10 times slower
than sequences (Illergird et (11., 2009), one can imagine the advan—
tage of using ‘structural profiles’ that would be generated from 1D
descriptions of protein structures, in the same way that sequence
profiles are generated from amino acid sequences. Indeed, protein
structure being more conserved than sequence through evolution,
these structural profiles would be more conserved and richer in evo—
lutionary information than sequence profiles and, therefore, better
at detecting distant homologies.

In this article, we present ORION, a new method for fold
recognition using evolutionary information from both amino acid
sequence and protein structure, and encoded as combined sequence/
structure profiles. Our method uses the accurate sequential descrip—
tion of protein local conformations provided by the 16—state
structural alphabet protein blocks (PB) (de Brevern et (11., 2000), in—
stead of the conventional three—state secondary structure, which has

important drawbacks, especially for describing the loops which con—
stitutes ~45% of the local structure of the proteins. The relevance of
PB structural information has previously been demonstrated through
numerous applications (Joseph et (11., 2010), such as structural align—
ment (Gelly et (11., 2011) and local structure prediction (Rangwala
et (11., 2009; Zimmermann and Hansmann, 2008). The novelty of
our method also lies in the use of a combination of sequence and
structural profiles for both target and template. The structural pro—
files used for the template were derived from structural alignments
of the HOMSTRAD database (Mizuguchi et (11., 1998). For distantly
related proteins, structural alignments have been shown to be more
relevant than sequence alignments (Elofsson, 2002). Thus, using as a
benchmark the 1032 structural families from HOMSTRAD and 150
targets from the eighth, ninth and tenth editions of the Critical
Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments (Moult
et (11., 2009, 2011, 2014), we show that ORION outperforms the
HHsearch algorithm in recognizing proteins with same or similar
folds. Our detailed analysis further indicates that this accurate hom—
ology detection can be attributed to the inclusion of the PB struc—
tural descriptors into profile—profile alignments.

2 Materials and methods

ORION is a fold recognition method based on the pairwise com—
parison of profiles combining sequence and structural information.
The three major steps of ORION algorithm are presented in the fol—
lowing sections and illustrated in Figure 1. The first step is the gener—
ation of the template profile library. Sequence profiles are obtained
from MSAs of HOMSTRAD families and represent the 20 amino
acid scores for each position of the MSA. Structural profiles repre—
sent the 16 PB scores for each position of the MSA. The MSAs of
templates, derived from structure alignments, were translated into
PB MSAs using the atomic coordinates of the protein structures to
generate template PB profiles. Amino acid and PB profiles are joined

to form ‘AAPB profiles’ containing both sequence and structural
evolutionary information. From the query sequence, the second step
consists in generating a query profile. The query sequence profile is
obtained after three iterations of PSI—BLAST and is used to predict
the query PB profile. The third and last step is the search for related
proteins in the template profile library.

The construction of the AAPB profiles library is described in de—
tails in the Section 2.1 and 2.2; the benchmark datasets are detailed
in the Section 2.8. ORION performs a global/local alignment by a
dynamic programming approach: implementation of dynamic pro—
gramming, profile scoring function and evaluation of statistical sig—
nificance of score alignments are described in Sections 2.4—2.7.

2.1 Fold library

The profile library was constructed from HOMSTRAD structural
alignments. This database regroups protein families through struc—
tural alignments, with 3454 protein structures regrouped into 1032
families. Each family corresponds to a domain identified in the
SCOP database (Murzin et al., 1995). The four major SCOP classes,
at, [3, ad]? and ot+/)’, represent 20, 19, 25 and 22% of the database,
respectively.

2.2 AAPB profile library

Amino acid profiles were generated from the MSA of family mem—
bers for each family. MSAs families were enriched with homologous
sequences (Mizuguchi et al., 1998) and sequences with more than
90% identity were filtered out. The weight of each sequence in the
profile depends on its relative diversity (i.e. compared with all the
other sequences in the MSA) and is calculated using the Henikoff—
Henikoff position—based sequence weights (Henikoff and Henikoff,
1994). Profiles are then weighted using ‘pseudo—counts’ described in
the Henikoff—Henikoff weighting scheme (Henikoff and Henikoff,
1996). To avoid non—significant columns in the profile, positions
with more than 70% gaps were discarded.

The PB profiles were obtained by translating the HOMSTRAD
structural MSAs into PB MSAs using the atomic coordinates of the
protein structures (de Brevern et al., 2000). PB profiles are weighted
in the same way as for AA profiles. Such profiles based on structural
alphabet provide structural evolutionary information, which is ex—
pected to improve the detection of remote homologies.

2.3 Generating query AAPB profiles

MSAs were obtained by three iterations of PSI—BLAST on Uniref90
(Suzek et al., 2007) (a subset of the UniProt database containing no
pair of sequences with >90% identity) with an E—value threshold of
1074. At most 1000 alignments were saved at each round. Each pro—
file was built from the last round of PSI—BLAST. MSAs were purged
by removing sequences with more than 70% identity.

PB profiles are generated using the LOCUSTRA program
(Zimmermann and Hansmann, 2008), which predicts a sequence of
PB from a PSI—BLAST MSA, using a two—layer support vector ma—
chine (SVM) approach. The input is a PSSM matrix of the 20 residue
types extracted from the checkpoint file generated by PSI—BLAST.
We modified LOCUSTRA to obtain a PB profile of 16 columns cor—
responding to the SVM multiclass posterior probabilities for the 16
letters.

2.4 Profile—profile scoring function

The PICASSO scoring function introduced by Heger and Holm
(2001) has been shown to be one of the most efficient scoring func—
tions for comparing two amino acid profiles. Mittelman et al.

(2003) modified it into several variants. The one we chose here is
PICASSO3Q (1), which uses only the query and template frequen—
cies Qi and Q], from query position i and template position i of the
profiles in symmetric Equations (2, 3):

where Qaa and Qpb are the amino acid and PB frequencies, respect—
ively. pmx is the background frequency of the amino acid x and ppby
the background frequency of PB letter y. S(i,/') is the sum of SAA(i,/')
and SpB(i,/'), which are the PICASSO3Q scores over the amino acid
and structural alphabet profiles, respectively. The PICASSO3Q
method was applied in the same way for PB and amino acid profiles.
S(i,/') is normalized by the median score pair 517 and the SD a(sp) of
S (i,/' ) over all column pair (i.e. profile—profile) scores in the database.
The median value appears to be preferable to the mean when there
are a lot of extreme pair scores (Gonzales and Ottenbacher, 2001).
In PICASSO3Q, the natural logarithm In is used instead of log, but
we found that the latter performed slightly better (5% higher sensi—
tity at 10% specificity, data not shown). A shift of 0.1 is added to
the score to make average scores negative and consequently avoid
the alignment of unrelated residues in local regions.

2.5 Dynamic programming

ORION carries out global/local dynamic programming to obtain
the optimum global/local alignment. This variant of the Smith and
Waterman’s (1981) local/local and Needleman and Wunsch’s
(1970) global/global algorithm locally aligns the query against the
whole template. We consider that query sequences may be com—
posed of multiple domains that require to be locally aligned, while
template family sequences are generally composed of a unique and
well—delimited domain that must be globally aligned. It also estab—
lished that global—local algorithm performs better for fold recogni—
tion (Fischer et al., 1996). The optimal gap opening penalty go and
the optimal gap extension penalty ge were determined by an itera—
tive grid approach on a non—redundant subset of 402 sequences (i.e.
the sequences having <30% sequence identity with their family
members). Pairwise alignments were performed and all alignments
obtained were compared with their respective structural alignments.
The pair of values (go, ge) maximizing the percentage of correctly
aligned positions was chosen as the optimal values. These optimal
values (go : 2 and ge : 0.2) were set as default parameters. We have
tested different subsets of HOMSTRAD and have observed that the—
ses values are stable and do not depend of the subset composition.

2.6 Metafold: a supplementary level for remote protein
structure similarities

The concept of metafold was introduced to characterize fold similar—
ities (Day at al., 2003). For example, authors clustered the TIM bar—
rels and the beta propellers into the same fold family (Soding and
Remmert, 2011), while these structures are classified in two differ—
ent folds in SCOP. Metafold classification is obtained by a consen—
sus of fold classifications in SCOP, CATH and Dali databases, and
thus provides a more unified view of fold space. Here, we propose

9103 ‘Og JSanV uo sajaﬁuv soc} ‘Btulomcg JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'slcumoip1o1xo"sotJBuiJOJutotq/ﬁduq 11101} pQPBOIIIAAOG

Improving protein fold recognition

 

to use the metafold as an additional hierarchical level above the fold
level of SCOP database. There are 422 metafolds groups in the
HOMSTRAD database. As expected, immunoglobulin—like and
Rossmann fold groups are the most populous ones.

2.7 Statistical significance of score alignments

The raw alignment score depends on the composition of the two
profiles compared but also on the alignment length. For each family
template, a score distribution has been precalculated. For a given
family, the template family profile was aligned to a set of 422 pro—
files of unrelated proteins. Proteins used to obtain score distributions
of unrelated targets must be structurally independent. Therefore,
scores from protein pairs belonging to the same SCOP fold level or
within the same metafold class were removed. Scores of amino acid
sequence alignments usually follow an extreme value distribution, a
Gumbel law in most cases. Here, score distributions show a good fit—
ness to the Weibull distribution law (Supplementary Fig. S1). In fact,
the addition of structural information into profiles modifies the
score distributions that are close to distributions of threading scores
(Fayyaz Movaghar et al., 2011). ORION computes a P value from
the raw score and the Weibull law parameters that are specific to
the template family.

2.8 Benchmark datasets

ORION was compared with different programs to evaluate the dis—
tant homology detection rate. Therefore, a query test set has been
constituted from the 1032 HOMSTRAD families. For each family,
the representative sequence is selected based on the sequence identity
between the family members, knowing that the representative se—
quence share the highest average sequence identity with the rest of
the family. The SCOP annotation is hierarchical with the higher lev—
els (family and superfamily levels) describing near evolutionary rela—
tionships; the fold level describes distant relationships and/0r
structural similarities. The metafold level is a consensus level that
describes very distant protein similarities. To assess the programs
for different degrees of protein relationship, three query datasets
have been constituted, one for each level (superfamily, fold and
metafold) by selecting sequences having at least one structure in
HOMSTRAD with the same SCOP level. This selection resulted in
484, 413 and 434 sequences for the superfamily, fold and metafold
levels, respectively. All the sets are non—redundant since 95% of se—
quences pairs have less than 18, 17 and 16% sequence identity
(superfamily, fold and metafold level, respectively). The methods
were independently tested for these different levels. HHsearch and
PSI—BLAST were tested in the same way as for ORION. For
HHsearch, we generated ‘hhm’ profiles for the queries and the data—
base from MSAs of PSI—BLAST and HOMSTRAD famillies, respect—
ively, using the hhmake program available in the HH—suite package
(ftp://t00lkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/pub/HH—suite/). The database of
hhm profiles has been generated following the HH—suite user guide.
HHsearch was run using the query hhm as input file and the
HOMSTRAD database of hhm profiles as the input database. For
PSI—BLAST, a three—iteration search was run in the HOMSTRAD
enriched sequence database with the default E—value threshold for
inclusion (0.002). For each query, the methods give a ranked list of
proteins from the database. Proteins are ranked by E—value for PSI—
BLAST, probability for HHsearch and raw score for ORION. The
true positives (TPs) and false positives (FPs) were counted consider—
ing the classification level of interest. A TP was denoted when the
two proteins compared (which define a ‘hit’) belong to the same
class level (e.g. b.1.18.2 and b.1.10.1 at fold SCOP level) and a FP is

and HHsearch without structural information (‘ORION no PB' and ‘HHsearch
no 88', respectively) are also shown

counted for hits within different class levels (e.g. b.1.18.2 and
b.2.6.1 at fold SCOP level). The hits with the same superior class
levels were ignored (e.g. b.1.18.11 and b.1.18.2 at fold SCOP level).
Each protein is then labeled as TP or FP in the ranked list. Similar
benchmark procedures are employed by authors for assessing the
template detection performance of their methods (Soding, 2005;
Soding and Remmert, 2011; Xu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2011).

Some SCOP classes in query test sets and template database may
be overrepresented, and the results could suffer from this compos—
itional bias. For example, the immunoglobulin fold and the
Rossmann fold are the most represented in the HOMSTRAD data—
base, which could bias the results for these families. To prevent these
compositional biases from dominating the benchmarks, each tem—
plate and query is weighted with the number of member belonging
to the same level. Recently, Remmert et al. (2012) used a similar ap—
proach to weigh the folds that constitute their dataset.

3 Results and discussion

The distant homology detection rate of ORION has been assessed
and compared with those of the widely used PSI—BLAST and the
state—of—the—art method HHsearch. The results are described in the
Fig. 2 by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which illus—
trate the performance of a binary classifier, here, the evolution of
the true positive rate (TPR) in function of the false positive rate
(FPR) ranging from 0 to 10%. As expected, a basic profile—profile
method like ORION without PB outperforms a profile—sequence
method like PSI—BLAST, with a TPR> 10% higher for 10% FPR.
Not surprising either is the fact that the HMM—HMM profile align—
ments of HHsearch demonstrate higher performance than our
amino acid profile—profile method (2.7% higher TPR for 10%
FPR). However, the inclusion of PBs into ORION profiles leads to a
significant increase of the homology detection rate, with 2.1 times
more TP detected for 10% FPR, and makes our method outperform
HHsearch and PSI—BLAST. Indeed, for 10% FPR, ORION is 1.8
times (0.55/0.30) and 3.6 times (0.55/0.15) more sensitive than

HHsearch and PSI—BLAST, respectively. Thus, the structural fea—
tures encoded into PBs improve particularly fold recognition and re—
mote homology detection. These results could be explained by the
fact that the 16 structural patterns catch almost every local conform—
ation. Additionally, using structural information in the form of
structural profiles, which take into account the frequency of each
state at each position, gives to our fold recognition method a signifi—
cant advantage.

Table 1 shows the proportion of proteins for which at least one
correct template is found among the first five (Top 5) and first ten
(Top 10) results, for proteins belonging to the same superfamily,
fold and metafold levels. This kind of benchmark is particularly rele—
vant for the evaluation of template selection for comparative model—
ing. ORION detects on average 17.3 and 10.3% more correct
templates than PSI—BLAST and HHsearch respectively, in the top 1,
5 and 10. ORION is very efficient for detecting distant protein rela—
tionships (fold and metafold levels), with 20.4% and 13.7% more
templates detected than PSI—BLAST and HHsearch, respectively. At
superfamily level, HHsearch performs slightly (2.1%) better than
ORION. Proteins within the same superfamily but in different fami—
lies share a probable common evolutionary origin (Murzin et al.,
1995) with a higher sequence similarity than at fold level. Therefore,
the sensibility of sequence methods is still sufficient to detect a rela—
tionship between two homolog proteins at this level of divergence.

Similar results are observed with the ROC curves at superfamily,
fold and metafold levels (Fig. 3). At superfamily level, HHsearch
performs slightly better than ORION for very low FPR (0—1%), but
for higher FPR (1—10%) ORION clearly outperforms HHsearch. As
for top ranking, ORION outperforms HHsearch and PSI—BLAST at
fold and metafold levels and the difference becomes greater with the
inclusion of more templates. All methods have the lowest perform—
ances at metafold level, since this level is based on a higher structural
diversity among metafold classes, resulting in harder detection.
These results suggest that ORION is effective for very remote homo—
log detection with a high success rate. At fold and metafold levels,
true hits (i.e. correct detection of two related proteins) are very dis—
tant, with <15% sequence identity and, hence, cannot be easily
identified solely from their amino acid sequences. Therefore, meth—
ods including additional structural information, such as ORION,
allow better detection at these levels.

The CASP targets dataset was constituted by selecting the targets
of CASP8, 9 and 10 belonging to the ‘Template—based modeling’ cat—
egory. We kept targets with at least one template in the
HOMSTRAD database within the same fold level. Thus, our CASP
dataset contains 150 targets: 49 (out of 120) from CASP8, 72 (out
of 111) from CASP9 and 29 (out of 67) from CASP10. This dataset
is composed of ‘Hard’ difficulty targets, since 95 % of the pairs share
<15 % sequence identity and the true positive pair maximum

Fig. 4. Performance of ORION, HHsearch and PSI-BLAST at detecting related
proteins within the same fold, for all pairs of the CASP dataset

sequence identity is 21.1%. The related ROC curves (Fig. 4) show
that ORION performs better than PSI—BLAST and HHsearch at de—
tecting template structures. For 10% FPR, ORION detects 2.1 times
more related proteins than HHsearch and 2.5 times more than PSI—
BLAST.

This holds true for the top ranking comparisons (Table 2), with
8.6 and 22.9% more homologs detected at the top 10, compared
with HHsearch and PSI—BLAST, respectively. Results of ROC curves
and top rankings on CASP dataset are similar to those obtained
from the HOMSTRAD dataset, except that lower performances are
observed due to the overall difficulty of the CASP targets.

Six examples of CASP11 targets are presented to underline the
importance of the template selection in the protein structure predic—
tion (Table 3). Models were generated with MODELLER (Eswar

et al., 2006) based on templates and alignments provided by
ORION and HHsearch and were evaluated by the GDT—HA (Read
and Chavali, 2007), GDT_TS (Zemla et al., 1999) and TM—scores
(Zhang and Skolnick, 2004). The results show that the templates se—
lected by ORION and HHsearch are different. Indeed, ORION se—
lects better templates than HHsearch, which significantly increases
the GDT_TS (improvement ranging from 0.7% for T0829—D1 up to
18.7% for T0855—D1). Thus, ORION provides better templates for
generating models that are closer to the target structure. For T0784—
D1 and T0847—D1 models, ORION and HHsearch converged to
identical templates (PDB codes 1byrA and 21rgA) but the additional
templates selected by ORION lead to better models than those ob—
tained from HHsearch (4.4 and 2.6% of GDT_TS increases). The
prediction of the ‘Easy’ target T0773—D1, based on the three tem—
plates found by ORION (PDB codes 1mlaA, 2jsxA and 1in0A), is
close to the target structure, with the same orientation of beta sheets
and alpha helices (Fig. 5A). For the ‘Medium’ T0829—D1 and ‘Hard’
T085 5—D1 targets, the prediction of Of helices positioning is more dif—
ficult but the pattern of beta strands is correct (Fig. 5B and C).

4 Conclusion

We have developed ORION, a profile—profile alignment method for
fold recognition based on a structural alphabet that improves re—
mote homology detection. ORION is able to detect between 2 and
10% more homologs than the state—of—the—art method HHsearch on
a balanced test set derived from the HOMSTRAD database. On an—
other test set of target sequences from CASP8, 9 and 10, ORION
systematically outperforms HHsearch and PSI—BLAST, detecting, re—
spectively, 4.6 and 16.0% more templates at fold level (Table 2,
mean difference in success rate for top 1, 5 and 10). Our method
works particularly well for distantly related proteins due to the add—
ition of accurate predictions of local structural information in the
form of PBs.

A possible improvement of ORION would be to incorporate
other accurately predicted structural features, such as solvent acces—
sibility. The combination of such structural descriptors with the PBs
should provide a good approximation of the environment

preferences for each amino acid of the target protein sequence. This
information is helpful to predict structural core positions and, there—
fore, identify more remote homologs. For example, a series of cen—
tral buried alpha helices could be identified from the target sequence
with a combination of the predicted PBs and solvent accessibility de—
scriptors, these latter restricting the number of possible template
hits.

Another possible improvement would touch on the weights of
the different terms in the scoring function. Optimal weights were
obtained from an evaluation of the successful detection rate on a
balanced HOMSTRAD test set. This assessment indicates that the
sequence and structural scoring terms should be equally weighted
for the highest success rate (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, the
weights could be dynamically adjusted according to the target se—
quence. Thus, while close homologs detection is based on the se—
quence, very remote homologs detection requires using more
structural information, since the structure is more conserved than
the sequence throughout the evolution. To address the issue of the
weighting of the scoring terms, ORION may evaluate the difficulty
of the detection in the initial search and then adjust the different par—
ameters and perform another search in the template library. Finally,
ORION and HHsearch show significant differences in template de—
tection suggesting that they are complementary. Thus, ORION
would also contribute to the improvement of the quality of meta—
servers and other consensus—based prediction algorithms.

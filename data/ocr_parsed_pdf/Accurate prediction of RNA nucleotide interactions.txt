Abstract

Motivation: Given the importance of non—coding RNAs to cellular regulatory functions, it would be
highly desirable to have accurate computational prediction of RNA 3D structure, a task which
remains challenging. Even for a short RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is
immense; existing methods to identify native—like conformations mostly resort to random sampling
of conformations to achieve computational feasibility. However, native conformations may not be
examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised due to sampling. State—of—the—art
methods have yet to deliver satisfactory predictions for RNAs of length beyond 50 nucleotides.
Results: This paper presents a method to tackle a key step in the RNA 3D structure prediction
problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired 3D structure. The
research is based on a novel graph model, called a backbone k—tree, to tightly constrain the nucleo—
tide interaction relationships considered for RNA 3D structures. It is shown that the new model
makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions (including the
non—canonical interactions in all recently revealed families) from the query sequence along with
known or predicted canonical basepairs. The preliminary results indicate that in most cases the
new method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the 3D
structure ofthe query sequence. It thus provides a useful tool for the accurate prediction of RNA 3D
structure.

1 Introduction

In the past decade; there have been many revelations of the import-
ance of non-coding RNAs to cellular regulatory functions and thus a
growing interest in the computational prediction of RNA 3D struc-
ture (Laing and Schlick, 2010; Leontis and Westhof, 2012).
Nevertheless, RNA 3D structure prediction from a single RNA
sequence is a significant challenge. One major unresolved issue is the
immense space of tertiary conformations even for a short RNA

sequence. Existing methods usually employ random sampling algo-
rithms for computation feasibility; which assemhle sampled tertiary
motifs into native-like structures (Das and Baker, 2007; Ding et (11.,
2008; Jonikas et (11., 2009; Parisien and Major, 2008; Popenda et
(11., 2012; Sharma et (11., 2008). To reduce the chance to miss native
structures; the assembly algorithms have mostly been guided with
constraining structural models. For example; MC-Fold/MC-Sym
(Parisien and Major, 2008) assumes the 3D structure consists of 4-nt

Treewidth

cyclic tertiary motifs constructible from the predicted secondary
structure. Rosetta (Das and Baker, 2007; Das et al., 2010) de not/o
assembles 3D structure from a database of 3-nt tertiary fragments.
Other methods follow samplings that preserve the secondary struc-
ture (Bida and Maher, 2012; Popenda et (11., 2012; Reinharz et (11.,
2013). However, these constraining models do not necessarily en-
sure that native conformations are examined. The state-of-the-art
methods have yet to deliver the desired prediction accuracy for RNA
sequences of lengths beyond 50 nucleotides (Laing and Schlick,
2010)

In this work, we introduce a novel method to predict nucleotide
interactions from known or predicted canonical basepairs as a key
step toward accurate prediction of 3D structure. Accurate know-
ledge of the nucleotide interactions is crucial to predicting the 3D
structure of an RNA and subsequently predicting its functional
roles. To predict nucleotide interactions, our method is guided by a
novel graph model called a backbone k-tree, for small integer k, to
globally constrain the nucleotide interaction relationships (NIRs)
that constitute the 3D structure. In such a k-tree graph, nucleotides
are organized into groups of size k + 1, such that NIRs are permit-
ted only for nucleotides belonging to the same group and groups are
connected to each other with a tree topology (see section 2). This
model was inspired by our recent discovery of the small treewidth of
the NIR graphs for more than 3500 RNA chains extracted from
1984 RNAs whose structures have been resolved (Fig. 1), where the
treewidth of each NIR graph is computed by an approximation
algorithm (Bodlaender and Koster, 2010). Treewidth is a graph met-
ric, which indicates how much a graph is tree-like (Bodlaender and
Koster, 2010; Van Leeuwen, 1990). We have been able to develop
dynamic programming (DP) algorithms with ()(nk ‘ 1) time and
space complexities, efficient for small k, to compute the optimal
backbone k-tree spanning over the nucleotides on the query se-
quence, given a scoring function (Ding et al., 2014a,b).

To ensure that the computed optimal k-tree can actually yield
the set of nucleotide interactions that constitutes the native 3D struc-
ture, our method proposes to identify detailed patterns of nucleotide
interactions for every group of k+1 nucleotides found in known
RNA 3D structures and to score every such pattern. We consider nu-
cleotide interactions from the established geometric nomenclatures
and families (Leontis and Westhof, 2001; Leontis et (11., 2002;
Stombaugh et (11., 2009), including base—base, base—phosphate,
base—ribose (Zirbel et al., 2009; Zirbel, 2011), base—stacking inter-
actions as well as the phosphodiester bonds between two neighbour-
ing nucleotides on the backbone. To test our method, we adopted an
improved 3-tree model, and pre-computed candidates of interaction
patterns for every group of 4 given nucleotides (see Supplementary

Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material). These annotated atom-level
interaction patterns have been extracted from resolved 3D structures
of RNAs in the RNA Structure Atlas (Sarver et al., 2008). To avoid
overfitting, only nucleotide interactions from RNAs of length S100
nucleotides were selected. To score such patterns, we trained artifi-
cial neural networks (ANNs) to compute the confidence of every
admissible nucleotide interaction pattern for every group of 4 given
nucleotides. We filtered out unlikely interaction patterns and kept
only those with high confidences. With this 3-tree model, our algo-
rithm efficiently predicts an optimal set of nucleotide interactions
from the query sequence (along with canonical base pairs) within
computational time ()(n3). We have implemented the algorithm
into a program called BkTree as a part of a 3D structure prediction
framework (Supplementary Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material).

We evaluated our methods through testing BkTree on two sets of
data. First, the performance of nucleotide interaction prediction was
measured on a set of 43 RNAs of lengths ranging from 26 to 128
nucleotides, a benchmark used by the survey of state-of-the-art 3D
structure prediction methods (Laing and Schlick, 2010). The
resolved, atom-level interactions of these high resolution RNAs
were extracted with FR3D (Sarver et al., 2008). Sensitivities (STY),
positive predictive values (PPV) and Matthews correlation coeffi-
cients (MCC) (Laing and Schlick, 2010) of the nucleotide inter-
actions predicted by BkTree were calculated for these 43 RNAs. The
overall performance was also compared with previous programs
MC (Parisien and Major, 2008), Rosetta (Das and Baker, 2007),
and NAST (Jonikas et al., 2009). Second, performance of nucleotide
interaction prediction was also evaluated by testing BkTree on a set
of 13 single RNA chains from PDB (Berman et al., 2000) of lengths
between 100 and 200 nucleotides, whose nucleotide interaction pat-
terns have not been extracted for the construction of ANNs. To
evaluate the significance of our method to 3D structure prediction,
we modeled 3D conformations from predicted nucleotide inter-
actions for all 43 RNAs. Both root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
values and deviation index (DI; Parisien et al., 2009) values were
calculated from the modeled 3D conformations. RMSD compari-
sons on about a dozen representative RNAs were also made with
previous methods MC, Rosetta, NAST, and RNA—MoIP (Reinharz
et al., 2013). These evaluations show that BkTree predicted nucleo-
tide interactions with high accuracies across the tested RNAs,
including RNAs whose interaction patterns were not used for train-
ing. Our method also impressively outperformed the other methods
on the overwhelming majority of the tested RNAs and showed a
great potential for handling RNAs beyond short lengths.

2 Model and methods

In this work, we consider RNA nucleotide interactions of atomic-
resolution of all known types, Supplementary Table S1 in the
Supplementary Material summarizes these nucleotide interactions
by their geometric families.

We use notation (X. Y. t) for a type t interaction between nucleo-
tides X and nucleotide Y (from 5’ to 3’), where X. Y E {A. C.G.U}.

2.1 Backbone k—tree model

Let .' : SIS;  3,, be an RNA sequence, in which

(NIR) model for the native structure of S is a pair <C;A>, where C
: (V.E) is called the NIR graph of S with vertex set
V : {1.2.  .n}, and A is an association such that for every pair

L.Ding et al.

 

i</, A(i,/) Q 155/ is the set of interactions between nucleotides S,
and S, in the native structure and A(i,/) : 0 implies (i,/) E E.
Note that because of phosphodiester bonds between neighboring nu—
cleotides, the NIR graph G always contains the Hamiltonian path
(i,i+ 1), i: 1,2,  ,n — 1; these edges are named backbone
edges.

In our recent investigation (Ding et al., 2014a,c), we con—
structed NIR graphs for all RNAs whose 3D structures were
known from RNA Structure Atlas (Reinharz et al., 2013). We dis—
covered that an overwhelming majority of these RNAs are of small
treewidths (Fig. 1). Theoretically, if a graph has treewidth bounded
by k, any clique obtained by deleting vertices and edges and con—
tracting edges of the graph can contain at most k+1 vertices
(Arnborg et al., 1990). Thus the distribution of treewidths suggests
that NIRs in the RNA 3D structures are in general not arbitrarily
complex.

The concept of treewidth is closely related to, and may be better
explained with the notion of k-tree, which is central to this work.

(Patil, 1986) Let integer k21. The class of k-trees
are graphs defined by the following inductive steps:

DEFINITION 1:

1. A k—tree of k + 1 vertices is a clique of k + 1 vertices;

2. A k—tree of n vertices, for n > k + 1, is a graph consisting of a k—
tree G of n—1 vertices and a vertex U, which does not occur in
G, such that 11 forms a (k + 1)—clique with some k—clique already
in G.

Supplementary Figure 53a and b in the Supplementary Material
show a 3—tree of 7 vertices. It is well known that for any k 2 1, a
graph is of treewidth g k if and only if it is a subgraph of some k—
tree (Arnborg and Proskurowski, 1989). This also suggests that
every graph of treewidth 3k can be augmented with additional
edges into a k—tree. Thus, given a NIR model (G;A), where NIR
graph G is of a treewidth S k, one can augment G to a k—tree with
additional edges, and for each newly added edge (i, i), let A(i,/) : 0.
Since such k—trees contain all backbone edges, they are called
back bone k-trees.

DEFINITION 2: A backbone k-tree model is a NIR model (GA) in
which NIR graph G is a backbone k—tree.

This allows us to conclude that for small values of k, backbone
k—tree models exist for an overwhelmingly majority of RNAs whose
native structures are known. Supplementary Figure S3c in the
Supplementary Material shows a backbone 3—tree as the NIR graph
for a short sequence consisting of 7 nucleotides.

To predict the set of nucleotide interactions from a query
sequence S : S1S2, . . . Sn, we propose to identify a backbone k—tree
model (G;A), where G : (V, E) and A(i,/) Q 15,5, such that
A(i,/) : 0 :> (i,/) E E. To ensure the identified model actually
corresponds to the set of nucleotide interactions that constitute the
native structure of the query sequence, we will quantify nucleotide
interactions for the optimization computation of such a backbone
k—tree model.

2.2 Quantification of nucleotide interactions
DEFINITION 3: Let q be a (k + 1)—clique in a backbone k—tree of
query sequence S. An interaction pattern (ip) for clique q is a set
A(q) of nucleotide interactions, for some association A, such that

Given an ip A(q) for clique q, the subgraph ofq induced by A(q),
denoted with Hqu) : (q, E,,,A(q)), is such that (i,/) E E,,,A(q) if and
only if A(i,/‘) : Q). Supplementary Figure 51 in the Supplementary

Material illustrates the examples of a (k + 1)—clique q, two ips of q
and their induced subgraphs.

DEFINITION 4: Let q be a (k + 1)—clique in a backbone k—tree of
query sequence S. The confidence of a given ip A(q) for clique q is

defined as

where cgﬂiw is the confidence of interaction (Si, S), t) given q and

the subgraph Hqu) induced by ip A(q).
In Section 3, we will introduce ANNs that compute confidence
£11121);qu
For every clique q, with 73(q), we denote the finite set of all ips
for q. In the practical application, we may only include those ips
in 73(q) which have ‘high’ confidences (e.g. above certain

threshold).

DEFINITION 5: Let k be any fixed integer 2 2. The nucleotide inter-
action prediction problem N1P(k) is, given an input query sequence
S, to identify a backbone k—tree model (G*; A"), such that

f(qIA(q)IS)} (2)

(G*;A*):arg max {
(G qinG.A<q)eP<q)

2.3 Overview of the method
To solve the N1P(k) problem, our method consists of three major
components.

1. Data repositories include NIPDB and NIPCTable. NIPDB is a
database of all possible interaction patterns. To build the data—
base, we first extracted a set 73(q) of nucleotide interaction pat—
terns for every (k + 1)—clique q, which were found in the known
3D structures of RNAs with length 3100 nucleotides. Then an
unique identiﬁer was assigned to each such clique by taking into
account both the nucleotides and their backbone distances. See
Supplementary Figure 51 in Supplementary Material for
examples.

NIPCTable is a matrix for compatibility between every pair
of ips for two cliques that share all but one vertex (nucleotide).
To compute for the optimization problem formulated with (2),
for every two (k + 1)—cliques q1 and qz that are adjacent in the
k—tree G, A(q1) and A(q2) are required to be compatible in the
sense that the two interaction sets among the k common nucleo—
tides of q1 and qz are identical. The compatibility of all pairs of
ips in NIPDB forms a binary matrix. For the efficiency, the com—
patibility can be precomputed before the prediction program is
executed. The nucleotides in an ip are ordered from 5’ to 3’.
Given two ips 11 and 12 each with k + 1 nucleotides, we enumer—
ate all (k + 1)2 ways of mapping k nucleotides of 11 to k nucleo—
tides of 12. For each of the mappings, if the selected two sets of
k nucleotides are not identical, two ips are not compatible;
otherwise, we further verify the interactions among the two sets
of k nucleotides and the compatibility holds when they are
identical.

2. A set of ANNs; each computes the confidence for a speciﬁc inter—
action between two given nucleotides on the query sequence.

3. A DP algorithm that computes the solution to Equation (2).

Given the query sequence S and the known or predicted canonical

basepairs on S, our method first employs ANNs to compute cgjngfq) ,

the confidence of the interaction (S,,S,, t) in the interaction pattern

A(q) for (k + 1)—clique q that involves vertices i and j, where Hqgm)
is the subgraph induced by ip A(q). This is done for every pair
of i< /, every interaction type t, every (k + 1)—clique q and every ip
A(q) E 73(q) for q. Then it computes the confidence score
f(q,A(q), S) for every ip A(q) E 73(q) of every (k + 1)—clique q, using
formula (1). Afterward, it runs the DP algorithm to solve Equation (2).

3 Algorithms

3.1 ANNs for computing interaction confidence

We constructed ANNs that compute confidences of nucleotide

interactions, one ANN for every specific nucleotide interaction

(Si, S), t) contained in a given specific interaction pattern A(q) of a
W)" ) to denote such an ANN

given  + 1)—clique q. We use NqHMW
W)" for the confidence score that the ANN computes.

[Lila/Inn . .
Each ANN 22:1,”) consists of an input layer, two hidden layers

(with 8 and 16 nodes, respectively), and an output layer
(Supplementary Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Material). The out—
put layer is a single unit producing a confidence value for inter—
action (Si, S), t). The input layer consists of input units representing
the selected global and local features shown in Supplementary
Table 52 in Supplementary Material. The features included the se—
quence length and the distance between the involved nucleotides as
well as neighboring nucleotide types. In addition, we included the
information of assumed canonical base pairs within the query

and c

sequence.

We adopted conventional methods to construct and train each
ANN (Mitchell, 1997), typically the technique of back—propagation
with gradient descent, using a fixed—size network. The learning rate
0.03 were the values that yielded the best results for some represen—
tative ANNs. The training data for the ANNs were from RNA
Structure Atlas. We removed all RNAs of lengths larger than 100
nucleotides and RNAs with missing nucleotides. This resulted in a
subset of 895 RNAs of single chains. Then all the (k + 1)—cliques q
along with their features of every RNA in the subset were enumer—
ated to form a whole set T. Due to different number of features, the
number of (k + 1)—cliques associated with different q, interaction
pattern A(q), and subgraph H,,,A(q) in T vary considerably. As a re—
sult, for most of the ANNs, only a small portion of 895 RNAs were
used for training and testing. A 10—fold cross validation was used to
avoid over—fitting.

3.2 Algorithm for N|P(k) problem

Our algorithm solves the N1P(k) problem by producing a pair
(G*;A*) satisfying Equation (2) for the query sequence. In particu—
lar, the backbone k—tree G" constrains the NIR topology, together
with the association A" of nucleotide patterns with all (k + 1)—
cliques in G", to achieve the maximum confidence score. The algo—
rithm maximizes the confidence score of a backbone k—tree span—
ning over the query sequence nucleotides by a DP process. To
derive recurrences for the DP, we followed the basic process of cre—
ating k—trees given in Definition 1. The inclusion of backbone
edges in the k—trees disallows introducing edges in arbitrary order
and thus makes the search space much smaller. We briefly explain
this algorithm in the following paragraphs.

By interval {i../], for i S f, we mean the set of consecutive integers
between i and /, inclusive. Two intervals {i../] and [bl] are non-
overlapping if either [Sb or 131‘. Let the query sequence be S of
length n and q be a (k + 1)—clique formed by k + 1 vertices drawn
from {1,2,  ,n}. Let C be a set of non—overlapping intervals
and A(q) E 73(q) be an ip for clique q. We define function

M(q,C,A(q),S) to be the maximum confidence of a k—tree con—
structed beginning from clique q, which includes backbone edge
(1', i + 1) for every pair of integers i and i+ 1 both contained in some
interval in C. Then we obtain the following recurrence:

M(q. C.A(q).S)

: max ,
XE4~y64~yElI~IlEC~ [7:41,-

max M ,C,A ,S
{ArmenmﬂrctqtQ<A<m.A<q)){ (p 1 (p) )

+ M(q. C2.A(q).S) +f(q.A(q).S)}}

where abbreviations q); : q U {y} \ {x}, Q(A(p),A(q)) asserts that
the chosen ip A(p) be compatible with the ip A(q), and R(C1, C2)
represents the choices of two sets of intervals, C1 and C2, which sat—
isfy the following constraints

1. {{i..y],  Q C1, {{w..x], {x..z]} Q C2, for applicable to and z;
and
2. C1 U C2 2 CU {(13-le ly-ll} \ {ii-ll}, and C1 D C2 = 0

Recurrence (3) offers a bottom—up process to compute
M (q, C, A(q), S). Intuitively, the idea is to create a new clique p from
q by introducing a new nucleotide vertex 3!. There may be one or
more sub—k—trees, some stemming from 17 while others from q (but not
including vertex 3!). Since these sub—k—trees will never join together
again, interval sets are used to ensure backbone edges will be properly
created. In particular, the set of backbone edges in the k—tree corres—
ponding to the value of function M(q, C, A(q), S) contains only those
edges between consecutive indexes specified in the intervals in C.
Initially, C may include intervals allowing all backbone edges.

The confidence score of the produced k—tree is computed as the
sum of confidence scores of ips chosen for all involved (k + 1)—
cliques. The chosen ips need to be compatible across the cliques
when they share nucleotide interactions or even just nucleotides.
This is ensured by the assertion Q(A(q),A(p)) by looking up table
NIPCTable. In addition, any pattern of interactions between a single
nucleotide and multiple others has to exist in the structure database.

To complete the recurrence (3), we need the following base case:

M(q. C.A(q).S) : 0 ifC : t)

which will be first computed in a bottom—up DP strategy.

3.3 Improved algorithms
Implementation of the above outlined DP algorithm would require

O(nk+1) memory space and O(nk+2)

computation time for every
fixed value of k. Following the same idea but creating (k + 1)—
cliques from k—cliques instead has lead to an improved algorithm,
with a few more sophisticated steps to navigate through k—cliques.
The improved algorithm uses O(nk) memory and O(nk+1) time for
every fixed value of k (Ding et al., 2014b).

For k : 3, the time efficiency can be further improved to O(n3)
with a constrained backbone k—tree model that requires every
(k+1)—clique to contain at least one backbone edge (i,i+ 1) for
some i. Testing has shown that the constrained backbone k—tree
model did not weaken the capability to account for sophisticated nu—
cleotide interactions as the ‘standard’ backbone k—tree model. The
constrained model may reduce biologically unfavorable interaction
patterns, e.g. those not involving locally related nucleotides.

3.4 Implementation
We have implemented the new method into a prototype system. The
NIPDB database construction was coded in Python, where the

In addition, Supplementary Table S3 in Supplementary Material
gives comparisons on average performance across the 43 RNAs be—
tween the four methods. In general, Bktree produced much better
average results than Rosetta and NAST, and comparable average re—
sults with MC, for which BkTree shows better average STY value
than MC, whereas MC gives better average PPV. On MCC values,
BkTree had an average over MC. On RNAs of length 250 nucleo—
tides, BkTree maintained almost the same average MCC as it did on
the whole set.

4.4 Performance on long RNAs

We also evaluated performance of BkTree on 13 longer RNAs with
diverse structures, including riboswitches, pseudoknots, synthetic
RNAs and RNAs containing multi—way junctions. These RNAs have
lengths from 101 to 174 nucleotides and thus they were not included
in the training data for ANNs. Supplementary Table S5 in
Supplementary Material shows that the performance on these long
RNAs is comparable to that of the 43 benchmark RNAs. In particu—
lar, the average MCC of the predictions is 0.787, suggesting the cap—
ability of our method to predict nucleotide interactions for RNAs of
lengths beyond 100 nucleotides.

4.5 Significance to 3D conformation prediction

To evaluate the significance of our method to prediction of 3D
structure, we have also developed a 3D conformation modeling
program that can be pipelined with BkTree for 3D structure pre—
diction (Xue et al., in preparation; also see Supplementary Fig. S2
of Supplementary Material). Here we briefly summarize the under—
lying method of the 3D modeling. The method takes as input the
predicted nucleotide interactions along with the predicted back—
bone k—tree that organizes the nucleotides into (k + 1)—cliques. 1t
assigns one geometric motif candidate to the set of predicted nu—
cleotide interactions within every clique. The candidates were first
extracted from RNA Structure Atlas (Sarver et al., 2008) with the
set of interactions considered. Then the geometry of each candi—
date was collected from PDB (Berman et al., 2000). Since there are
usually more than one motif candidate for every clique, motifs are
selected to achieve the highest consistency across all cliques in the
k—tree. The consistency between two motifs selected for two
respective ‘neighboring’ cliques is measured with the root—mean—
square—deviation (RMSD) on the two motif geometries involving
the k common nucleotides shared by the two cliques. The predicted
3D structure consists of a collection of motifs selected for all the
cliques, which has the lowest sum of the RMSDs across all pairs of
‘neighboring’ cliques. The input k—tree enables a DP algorithm to
compute the RMSD sum very efficiently, in particular, in time
O(C2N), where C is the number motif candidates considered for
each clique, and N is the number of cliques in the k—tree, linearly
proportional to the length n of the query RNA sequence. In add—
ition, the method assumes an option to use Amber (Saloman—Ferrer
et al., 2012) for structure refinement.

For each of the all 43 RNAs, the 3D modeling program produced
an optimally predicted 3D structure whose RMSD was calculated
against the resolved structure. The defamation index (D1) (Parisien et
al., 2009), a measure that accounts for both RMSD and MCC, the
quotient between them, was also calculated (see Supplementary Table
S7 in Supplementary Material). Supplementary Figure S6 in the
Supplementary Material plots the RMSD values for all the 43 RNAs.
These data suggest a great potential of our method for RNAs beyond
short lengths. In particular, 12 out of the 18 RNAs with lengths ex—
ceeding 50 nucleotides achieved RMSD values below 10A;

Supplementary Figure S5 in Supplementary Material shows some of
such examples. On the other hand, the sharp increase of RMSD values
for some of longer RNAs in Supplementary Figure S6 in the
Supplementary Material by no means indicates the failure of the back—
bone k—tree model or the proposed 3D modeling method on these
RNAs. Most of them appear to require a backbone 4—tree model, be—
yond the capability of the 3—tree based BkTree program (see Section 5).

To compare with other 3D structure prediction methods,
Supplementary Table S6 in Supplementary Material presents the
performance values on the 4 representative RNAs chosen in (Laing
and Schlick, 2010) which typically contain two hairpins and two
junctions. Since both MC and Rosetta allow prediction of multiple
optimal or suboptimal folds, we chose to use the best and the aver—
aged values of their solutions. For every one of the 4 RNAs, the
RMSD achieved by BkTree is significantly smaller than both the
best and the averaged values achieved by MC and Rosetta.

The more recently developed 3D structure prediction program
RNA—MoIP (Reinharz et al., 2013) shows some remarkable im—
provements of the geometries with an integer programming method
to fit tertiary motifs into the predicted secondary structure. In
Supplementary Table S7 of Supplementary Material, BkTree is com—
pared with RNA—MoIP on all the 9 RNAs tested by RNA—MoIP, all
of lengths exceeding 50 nucleotides. This is not an ideal comparison
as we have input to BkTree program the known canonical Watson—
Crick base pairs instead of the predicted secondary structure. It
shows that for 5 out of the 9 RNAs, our method achieved a RMSD
value even smaller than the minimum RMSD achieved by RNA—
MoIP on each of the 5 RNAs. On the 6th RNA 2H0], our RMSD is
4.024A, close to the minimum RMSD 3.19A but much smaller
than the average 7.19A achieved by RNA—MoIP. On two slightly
longer RNA sequences 1LNG and 1MFQ, our predictions yielded
RMSDs larger than what RNA—MoIP produced. We will further dis—
cuss the performance issue in next section.

5 Discussion and conclusion

Our method is a non—conventional framework to predict RNA nu—
cleotide interactions (of all known types) without simultaneous pre—
diction of 3D structure. The underlying backbone k—tree model
drastically reduces the space of plausible nucleotide interaction rela—
tions, permitting not only efficient but also effective prediction of
nucleotide interactions. The evaluation test results have highlighted
the potential of our method as a viable step toward accurate 3D
structure prediction of RNA sequences beyond short lengths.

Our work has taken advantage of the recent growth of know—
ledge in the rich, high—resolution nucleotide interaction data. In
particular, our method predicts the most plausible set of inter—
actions based on confidence scores of individual interactions com—
puted with ANNs. The neural networks were trained and tested
with a small subset of single chain RNAs (all of lengths g 100 nu—
cleotides) extracted from the established database RNA Structure
Atlas. For each ANN that computes an individual interaction, a
10—folds cross validation was used to avoid overfitting. Indeed, test
results on RNAs not in the training data, especially those of
lengths > 100, have apparently justified the rationale of the pro—
posed confidence scores.

The evaluation tests have revealed that our method is robust in
the sense that only choices of k for the k—tree model may affect the
prediction results, especially on 3D modeling performance.
Supplementary Table S8 in Supplementary Material shows that nu—
cleotide interaction prediction by BkTree has allowed 3D modeling
to achieve RMSD values £6.7A for all but seven in the set of 43

RNAs. For those RNAs not in set T, all but one RNAs achieved the
same low RMSDs. A careful look at Supplementary Table S4 in
Supplementary Material shows that these RNAs are of more com—
plex structures and their NIRs are actually beyond the capability of
the backbone 3—tree model built in the program BkTree. In particu—
lar, column EdgeDiff of Table 4 shows that all these seven RNAs
have more than a few edges in their NIR graphs which cannot be
included by even the best backbone 3—tree model. For example, the
3—tree model can miss 6 and 9 edges in the NIR graphs of
the long RNAs 1LNG and 1MFQ, respectively. These edges corres—
pond to some important nucleotide interactions including those
between the hairpins of two helices in these two signal
recognition particle RNAs. Failure to predict these crossing inter—
actions has resulted in the considerably high RMSD values in
their 3D models. Supplementary Figure SS in Supplementary
Material shows the modeled 3D structure of 1LNG deviates from its
native structure due to those missed interactions across the two
hairpins.

Therefore, backbone k—tree models, for k > 3 are expected to im—
prove performance for RNAs of complex structures. However, one
major concern with such a model is the possibly impractical com—
plexity O(nk+1), for k 24, of implementation with the developed
DP algorithm. Our more recent study reveals that such obstacle can
be surmounted by taking advantage of some inherent properties of
backbone k—trees constructed from known RNA structures. For ex—
ample, our survey on more than 600 RNAs with known 3D struc—
tures (data not shown) suggests that in backbone 4—tree models of
these RNAs 5—cliques are basically of two types. One type of clique
is that the 5 nucleotides can be partitioned into at most 3 groups,
each containing vertices close to each other on the backbone. The
other type of clique models 4—5 sporadic nucleotides as a part of a
tertiary motif connecting 3 or 4 small regions of the backbone. Both
type of 5—cliques are thus of number O(n3) in total, potentially lead—
ing to an O(n3)—time (and space) implementation of the DP algo—
rithm with the backbone 4—tree model for nucleotide interaction
prediction.

The implemented neural networks for interaction pattern
scoring were designed and trained exclusively for the constraint
backbone 3—tree model. Thus to implement the backbone k—tree
model with a higher k, an updated knowledge—based scoring
system is needed. Using the same idea of the neural networks, due
to the increased number of features, a feature selection scheme will
need to be developed. Then the neural networks have to be
retrained.

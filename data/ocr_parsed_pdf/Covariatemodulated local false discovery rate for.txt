by presenting a novel, fully Bayesian approach for generalized
covariate—modulated local false discovery rate (cmfdr) estima—
tion, implemented using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling algorithm. Through this approach, we are
able to model the inﬂuence of a vector of covariates on the dis—
tribution of the test statistics and hence on the fdr. Section 2
gives a brief review of fdr (Efron and Tibshirani, 2002) and
introduces cmfdr, constructed from a Bayesian two—group mix—
ture model that incorporates covariates. Section 3 presents the
MCMC algorithm for fitting the model and drawing inferences
and applies cmfdr to examples involving both simulated and real
data. The last section is devoted to a discussion of results and
future work.

2 METHODS

Review of fdr

Efron and Tibshirani (2002) made the assumption that the test statistic z,-,
1 5 i 5 n, has a different distribution based on whether the null hypoth-
esis HOJ» is true or false, where n is the total number of tests (SNPs). The
non-null distribution will tend to have more extreme values of the test
statistic. Hence, 2,- follows a two-group mixture model

ﬂZi) = Haf0(2i) + 771f1 (2i), (1)

where 710 is the proportion of true null hypotheses, 711 = 1 — 710 is the
proportion of true non-null hypotheses, f0 is the probability density func-
tion if H0 is true and fl is the probability density function if H0 is false.
Local false discovery rate (fdr) is the posterior probability that the im test
is null given 2,-, which by Bayes rule is given by

fur/"0(a) _ 770]?)(4)
lei) _ Naf0(2i) + JTIf1(Zi) I

The null density was assumed to be standard normal (theoretical null)
or normal with mean and variance estimated from the data (empirical
null). The mixture density JTQf0(Z) + n1f1(z) was estimated by ﬁtting a
high-degree polynomial to histogram counts (Efron, 2010). If a set of
SNPs are selected with an estimated fdr 5 oz for some at 6 (0,1), then
we expect that on average (1 — at) X 100% of these will be true non-null
SNPs.

Covariate-modulated fdr

A set of external covariates observed for each hypothesis test may inﬂu-
ence the distribution of the test statistic (Efron, 2010; Sun et al., 2006).
Under this scenario, incorporating the covariate effects into fdr estima-
tion can dramatically increase power for gene discovery. For example, the
distribution of GWAS z-scores may depend on SNP-level functional an-
notations (Schork et al., 2013), pleiotropic relationships with related
phenotypes (Andreassen et al., 2013a, b), gene expression levels in certain
tissues, evolutionary conservation scores and so forth. These external
covariates can be used to break the exchangeability assumption implicit
in Equation (1) and potentially increase the power for gene discovery over
using standard fdr given in Equation (2).

Let x,» = (1, X“, m», ..., Xmi)T, where x,» denotes an (m + 1)-dimensional
vector of covariates (including intercept) for the im SNP. The cmfdr is
deﬁned as

cmfdr(zi) = ﬁli(xf)f(i(zi)

f(Zi lit)
_ 710(Xl')f(l(2i) 

710(xilfo(2;)+m(Iiifl(ztlxi)
where 711(xl») = 1 — 710(xl») is the prior probability that the im test is non-
null given x,» and f1(z,»|x,») is the non-null density of 2,- given xi. By
Bayes’ rule, cmfdr is the posterior probability that the im test is null

given both 2,- and x,». We assume that the density under the null hypothesis
does not depend on covariates. Both the probability of null status and the
non-null density are allowed to depend on covariates, as described below.

Central to the estimation of the null proportion is the assumption that
710 is large (say>0.90) and that the vast majority of SNPs with test stat-
istics close to 0 are in fact null. These assumptions are reasonable for
GWA data (Hon-Cheong et al., 2010).

A Bayesian Two-group model

Summary statistics from GWAS are often made publicly available only as
2-tailed P-values, and hence, the magnitude of the z score is recoverable
but not the sign. Moreover, the sign of the z score is a result of arbitrary
allele coding. Hence, we formulate the mixture model for the absolute
z-scores. The extension of our method to signed z-scores is
straightforward.

Folded normal—gamma mixture model The distribution of 2 under
H0 is assumed to have the folded normal distribution, with null density
f0(z) = 2¢00(z)1220, where ¢(z) is the normal density with mean 0 and
standard deviation :70, and 1220 is an indicator function that takes the
value 1 when 2 z 0 and 0 otherwise. The density of 2 under the alternative
hypothesis H1 is assumed to have a gamma distribution with shape par-
ameter a(x) and rate parameter )3. Figure 2 gives a graphic presentation
of these distributions. We chose a parametric non-null density for com-
putational efﬁciency in modeling the effects of covariates. Parametric
estimates of the non-null density also potentially provide more power
than non-parametric estimates. We chose the gamma density because
of its ﬂexible shape and ability to model right-skewed heavy-tailed
distributions.

Covariates x are allowed to modulate the shape parameter of the
gamma distribution

a(x) = exp{xTot}

where at = {010,011 ,Olz, ...,Olm}TiS an unknown parameter vector. The rate
parameter )3 is an unknown scalar not depending on x. While it is possible
to model the rate parameter as a function of x, we have found that this
leads to poor model convergence in the sampling algorithm, perhaps
because of the lack of identiﬁability with other model parameters.

Additionally, we specify a location parameter u>0 to bind the non-
null gamma densities away from zero. The ‘zero assumption’ of Efron
(2007) states that the central peak of the z-scores consists primarily of null
cases. Such an assumption is necessary to make the non-null distribution
identiﬁable and for the MCMC sampling algorithm to converge. The
assumption that the vast majority of SNPs with z-scores close to 0 are
null is already commonly made in GWAS. Hence, we set the location
parameter u = 0.68 in the gamma distribution, corresponding to the
median of the null density f0. All SNPs with absolute z-scores <0.68
are thus a priori considered null.

We complete the mixture model formulation by positing a latent indi-
cator vector 8 = (81, . . . , 8"), where 8,» = 1 if the im SNP is non-null and 0
otherwise. Then 711(xl») is the prior probability that 8,» = 1 given covariates
x,». The dependence of 711 on x is modeled via a logistic regression

where y = {)4}, y1, y2, ..., ym}T is a vector of unknown parameters. The
augmented likelihood function is then given by

where z: (21, ...,z,,)T is the vector of test statistics and X is the
n X (m +1) design matrix. Integrating out the latent indicators 8 gives
the mixture model corresponding to Equation (3).

Prior distributions We apply weakly informative priors to unknown
parameters {[3, at, y, a3}:

a ~ No, 2.1),
y ~ N(0, 2y), (5)
13 ~ Gammamo, b0),

where Ba and By have large values on the diagonal, ao and I20 are shape
and rate parameters of gamma distribution and ago and boo are shape and
scale parameters of inverse gamma distribution, respectively.
Hyperparameters are ﬁxed by the user. In the applications below, we
set the dispersion matrices Ba and By to be diagonal with variance
10000; (a0, b0) and (gowboo) were both set to (0.001,0.001).

Sampling scheme We sample the parameters oz, )3, y and 0% in turn
from their full conditional distributions via a Gibbs sampler using
MetroplisiHastings (M-H) steps. Combining (4) and (5), the full condi-
tional distributions are given as follows:

The full conditional posteriors for at and y in (6) do not take standard
forms and are sampled using a multiple-try M-H sampler (Givens and
Hoeting, 2005) with a multivariate t-distribution candidate. The full con-
ditional for )3 has a gamma distribution and for a3 an inverse gamma

Gibbs sampler also includes generation of 8, with a Bernoulli full condi-

We can obtain an a posteriori estimate of cmfdr(zi) for each 2,- as

by taking the median of cmfdr(l)(z,») across all L posterior draws. The

able at httpS://Sites.google.com/Site/covmodfdr/.

Simulation

We simulated phenotypes under different settings of generative
parameters from real genotype data available for n: 3719
healthy individuals. For each permutation of simulation settings,
we generated 100 unique phenotypes. We restricted our simula—
tions to chromosome 1 (N: 191 128 SNPs) for computational
efﬁciency, assuming it was representative of the whole genome.
These simulations allow us to evaluate the performance of our
method in scenarios that approximate realistic GWAS condi—
tions, including correlated SNPs according to true LD patterns.
A detailed description of the simulations and an expanded table
including comparisons with the methods of Efron (2007) and
Lewinger et a]. (2007) are given in the Supplementary Materials.

Table 1 displays the median number of SNPs rejected and the
false discovery proportion (FDP), or the proportion of rejected
SNPs not in LD with a causal SNP. The cmfdr performs rea—
sonably well across enrichment settings for more highly poly—
genic phenotypes, rejected SNPs conservatively for 711 = 0.05,
but becoming progressively worse at controlling the FDP for
phenotypes with low 711. The fdr of Efron (2007) controls the
FDP at similar levels but also has less power than cmfdr
(Supplementary Table S5). The X2 mixture model of Lewinger
et a]. (2007) rejects more SNPs than either fdr or cmfdr, but also
exhibits considerably higher FDP across the range of polygeni—
city levels. In particular, their model is unstable for null GWAS.

Real data application

publicly accessible database (Franke et al., 2010). CD is a type of
inﬂammatory bowel disease that is caused by multiple factors in
genetically susceptible individuals. For this example, we selected
the ﬁve SNP annotations from Schork et a]. (2013) displayed in
Fig. 1 to serve as covariates: intron, exon, 3/UTR, 5’UTR and
intergenic; all annotation scores with the exception of Intergenic
were ﬁrst log transformed. These were entered together into the
covariate—modulated mixture model, with the empirical null
setting. The MCMC algorithm was run for 25 000 iterations
with 20 000 retained draws. Plots of posterior draws showed con—
vergence to stable posterior distributions for all parameters.
Figure 3 shows the histogram of z—scores (all cases), the null
subdensity Info and the posterior median ﬁt of the mixture dens—
ity. The estimated overall non—null proportion 71] is 0.014. The
fdr for each z—score is given by the height of the null subdensity
at that score divided by the height of the mixture density. The
parameter estimates are shown in Table 2. The 3’UTR and
5’UTR categories are associated with higher values of the
shape parameter (and hence higher variance). Intron, exon,
3’UTR and 5’UTR are all associated with higher probability of
non—null status. In contrast, intergenic SNPs are associated with
higher values of the shape parameter and much lower probability
of non—null status (0.001 non—null proportion for intergenic SNPs
compared with the overall 71] = 0.014). The positive a? coefﬁcient
for intergenic SNPs is a reﬂection of this sparsity because inter—
genic SNPs require more extreme z—scores than genic SNPs to
obtain a high—posterior probability of being non—null.

Figure 4 compares the number of non—null SNPs rejected using
usual fdr (Efron, 2007), and cmfdr with the five annotation cate—
gories. cmfdr rejected far more SNPs than fdr (Efron, 2007). For
example, for a 0.05 cutoff, cmfdr rejects 3194 SNPs, whereas fdr
rejects only 592, a factor of 5.4 times as many rejected SNPs.
These 3194 SNPS consisted of 108 independent loci (leading SNP
cmfdr g 0.05 and >1 Mb apart from each other). Of these 108
independent loci, 66 had been previously described in Franke
et a]. (2010). Franke et a]. (2010) described an additional ﬁve
loci that were not discovered using a 0.05 cutoff; however, in our
analysis, each of these loci had a cmfdr <0.06. We found 42
novel loci where the leading SNP had a cmfdr g 0.05. Reporting
these ﬁndings as discoveries in accordance with the best practices
in GWAS would require replication in an independent sample
and a detailed characterization of their biological signiﬁcance,

both of which are beyond the scope of this article. However, to
demonstrate that our proposed method identiﬁes plausible can—
didate SNPs that might warrant this further investigation, we
undertook a pleiotropy analysis. Given that CD is known to
share etiology, including pleiotropic genetic factors (Cho and
Brant, 2011) with ulcerative colitis, it is likely that causal SNPs
would show joint associations. We found signiﬁcant enrichment
for nominal associations (p<0.05) with ulcerative colitis
(Anderson et al., 2011) for both the 71 previously discovered
loci (Bonferroni adjusted hypergeometric P—value =
1.33 x 10’“) and the 42 novel loci (Bonferroni adjusted hyper—
geometric P—value = 6.24 x 105). A complete list of previously
discovered and novel gene names is given in the Supplementary
Materials.

We performed further analyses on CD substudies to determine
whether this observed increase in the number of loci declared
significant translates to increased number of replicating SNPs
in de novo samples. The CD meta—analysis was composed of
summary statistics from eight substudies (Franke et al., 2010).
We computed z—scores from each of the 70 possible combinations
of four substudies, leaving the z—scores computed from the re—
maining four independent substudies as test samples. We then
estimated fdr and cmfdr for each training sample. For a given fdr
cutoff, we determined the number of SNPs that replicated in the
test sample. Replication was deﬁned as one—sided P g 0.05 and
with the same sign as the corresponding z score in the training
sample.

Number of replicated SNPs was much higher using cmfdr
compared with fdr. For example, for usual fdr there was an
average of 365 replicated SNPs (94.6% of SNPs declared signiﬁ—
cant) with an fdr cutoff of 0.05 in the training sample. In con—
trast, with the same cutoff using cmfdr, there was an average of
2956 SNPs (92.5% of declared signiﬁcant SNPs) that replicated
according to this deﬁnition, or almost 8.1 times as many SNPs.

Similar increases in the number of replicated SNPs was observed
for other cutoffs in the range. The larger number of SNPs
declared signiﬁcant for cmfdr compared with usual fdr largely
remained when matched with empirical replication rates rather
than nominal fdr threshold. For example, there was an average
of 339 SNPs declared signiﬁcant using usual fdr with an empir—
ical replication rate of 0.95, compared with 2769 using cmfdr, or
8.2 times as many SNPs. In general, and in contrast to some of
the simulation settings, replication rates were close to nominal
for both usual fdr and cmfdr, across a range of cutoffs.

4 DISCUSSION

Methods for large—scale hypothesis testing that control Type I
error rates without being overly conservative are crucial in
GWAS (Efron, 2007; Franke et al., 2010). It has become increas—
ingly evident that many complex phenotypes and diseases have
many genetic determinants, each with small effect (Yang et al.,
2010). Hence, traditional FWER correction is too conservative
and severely underpowered. FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995) and fdr (Efron and Tibshirani, 2002) have come to be
accepted broadly as routine techniques to control for the rate
of false positive in large—scale hypothesis testing settings in a
number of ﬁelds. However, even these methods do not account
for the vast majority of phenotypic variance explained by
common variants (Andreassen et al., 2013b). A problem with
these and other multiple testing methods is that all SNPs are
treated as exchangeable. In particular, each SNP is given the
same a priori probability of being non—null. On the contrary,
we (Schork et al., 2013) and others (Hindorff et al., 2009;
Smith et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011) have shown that the func—
tional role of SNPs has a strong impact on the probability of
association across a broad array of complex phenotypes and
diseases.

This work proposes a novel Bayesian approach (cmfdr) to
incorporate a set of important covariates into the fdr under a
heteroscedastic model, where the probability of non—null status
and the distribution of the test statistic under the non—null hy—
pothesis are both modulated by covariates. The primary advan—
tage of our methodology over traditional fdr methods is that two
SNPs with the same z score can have different values of cmfdr if
one is in a more enriched category than the other. Hence, by
using SNP annotations to modulate fdr, more SNPs can be dis—
covered for a given level of fdr control. In other words, methods
such as cmfdr that break the exchangeability assumption are
potentially more powerful than traditional fdr methods that
assume exchangeability. In the CD example, we discovered 5.4
times as many SNPs (unpruned) using cmfdr compared with
usual fdr for an identical 0.05 cutoff. The increase in number
of replicated SNPs in de novo subsamples from fdr to cmfdr was
even more dramatic. Parameter estimates of covariates can also
be biologically informative about the relative functionality of
different biological classiﬁcations of variants.

It is crucial to note that our LD—weighted SNP annotations
were computed independently of the phenotypes investigated.
Thus, modifying the fdr based on information from genic cate—
gories does not bias results toward rejecting more null hypoth—
eses. Moreover, the cmfdr methodology is capable of handling
any relevant source of information, including, for example,

pleiotropic relationships of SNPs with multiple phenotpyes
(Andreassen et al., 2013a, b), gene expression levels in various
tissues and evolutionary conservation scores, among others.

The proposed methodology has some drawbacks. First, as
currently formulated, it assumes all hypothesis tests are inde—
pendent. This is not true for SNPs in LD, and our 95% credible
intervals are probably too small. Moreover, it remains unclear
what impact LD has on FDP control because it may be the case
that all or almost all ‘tag SNPs’ are in partial LD with causal
SNPs but are not themselves causal. Correlation across SNPs
can be handled, for example, by repeatedly and randomly prun—
ing SNPs for independence before running the MCMC algo—
rithm, by using a discrete Markov random ﬁeld formulation
(Li et al., 2010) or by modeling SNPs simultaneously using, for
example, a multivariate mixed—effects model framework
(Carbonetto and Stephens, 2013). We have implemented a
random pruning option available with the R code distribution.
Second, it may be the case for some applications that the gamma
distribution does not ﬁt the tail probabilities of the non—null
distribution well. We have used other distributions (e.g. the
skewed generalized normal) and are currently developing a
non—parametric alternative that produces ﬂexible ﬁts to tail prob—
abilities. Although non—parametric estimates of the non—null
density avoid bias from lack of model ﬁt, parametric alternatives
can be more powerful if the ﬁt is adequate. Finally, it appears
from simulations that the cmfdr methodology can be overly lib—
eral in scenarios where 711 is close to 0. Care must therefore be
taken when applying cmfdr in these circumstances.

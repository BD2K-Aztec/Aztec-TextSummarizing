ABSTRACT

Summary: We built a web server named APOLLO, which can
evaluate the absolute global and local qualities of a single protein
model using machine learning methods or the global and local
qualities of a pool of models using a pair-wise comparison approach.
Based on our evaluations on 107 CASP9 (Critical Assessment of
Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction) targets, the predicted
quality scores generated from our machine learning and pair-wise
methods have an average per-target correlation of 0.671 and 0.917,
respectively, with the true model quality scores. Based on our test
on 92 CASP9 targets, our predicted absolute local qualities have
an average difference of 2.60 with the actual distances to native
structure.

wise global quality assessment software is also available at the site.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein model quality assessment plays an important role in
protein structure prediction and application. Assessing the quality of
protein models is essential for ranking models, reﬁning models and
using models (Cheng, 2008). Model Quality Assessment Programs
(MQAPs) predict model qualities from two perspectives: the global
quality of the entire model and the residue-speciﬁc local qualities.
The techniques often used by MQAPs include multiple-model
(clustering) methods (Ginalski et (11., 2003; McGufﬁn, 2007, 2008;
Paluszewski and Karplus, 2008; Wallner and Elofsson, 2007; Zhang
and Skolnick, 2004a), single model methods (Archie and Karplus,
2009; Benkert et (11., 2008; Cline et (11., 2002; Qiu et (11., 2008;
Wallner and Elofsson, 2003; Wang et (11., 2008) and hybrid methods
(Cheng et (11., 2009; McGufﬁn, 2009).

According to the CASP experiments, multiple-model clustering
methods are currently more accurate than single model methods.
However, they cannot work well if only a small number of models
are available. A hybrid quality assessment method (Cheng et (11.,
2009) was recently developed to combine the two approaches and
integrate their respective strengths. Here, we build a web server
to provide the community with access to all three model quality
assessment approaches (i.e. single, clustering and hybrid).

2 METHODS
2.1 Input and output

Users only need to upload or paste a single model ﬁle in Protein Data Bank
(PDB) format or a zipped ﬁle containing multiple models.

If a single model is submitted, APOLLO predicts the absolute global
and local qualities. If multiple models are submitted, APOLLO outputs the
absolute global qualities, average pair-wise GDT—TS scores, reﬁned average
pair-wise Q-scores, reﬁned absolute scores and pair-wise local qualities. All
the global qualities range between (0, l), where 1 indicates a perfect model
and 0 indicates the worst case.

2.2 Algorithms

The absolute global quality score is generated based on our single
model QA predictoriModelEvaluator (Wang et al., 2008). Given a single
model, ModelEvaluator (as MULTICOM-NOVEL server in CASP9) extracts
secondary structure, solvent accessibility, beta-sheet topology and a contact
map from the model, and then compares these items with those predicted
from the primary sequence using the SCRATCH program (Cheng et al.,
2005). These comparisons generate match scores which are then fed into an
SVM model trained on CASP6 and CASP7 data to predict the absolute global
quality of the model in terms of GDT—TS scores. To predict absolute local
quality score of a residue, the secondary structure and solvent accessibility
predicted from the sequence are compared with the ones parsed from the
model in a lS-residue window around the residue. For each residue in the
window, we also gather its contact residues that are 36 residues away
in sequence and have an Euclidean distance 58A in the model. Their
probabilities of being in contact according to the predicted contact probability
map are averaged. The averaged contact probabilities, the match scores of
secondary structure and solvent accessibility comparison and the residue
encoding are fed into an SVM to predict local quality. The SVM are trained
on the models of 30 CASPS single domain targets.

The average pair-wise GDT—TS score is generated using our latest
implementation (as MULTICOM-CLUSTER server in CASP9) of the widely
used pair-wise comparison approach (Larsson at al., 2009). Taking a pool
of models as an input, it ﬁrst ﬁlters out illegal characters and chain-break
characters in their corresponding PDB ﬁles. It then uses TM-Score (Zhang
and Skolnick, 2004b) to perform a full pair-wise comparison between these
models. The average GDT—TS score between a model and all other models
is used as the predicted GDT—TS score of the model. One caveat is that the
GDT—TS score of a partial model is scaled down by the ratio of its length
divided by the full target length.

The reﬁned global and local quality scores are generated using a hybrid
approach (as MULTICOM-REFINE server in CASP9) (Cheng et al., 2009)
that integrates single model ranking methods with structural comparison-
based methods. It ﬁrst selects several top models (i.e. top ﬁve or top ten)
as reference models. Each model in the ranking list is superposed with the
reference models by the TM-Score. The average GDT—TS score of these
superposition is considered as the predicted quality score. The superposition

with the reference models is also used to calculate Euclidean distances
between the same residues in the superposed models. The average distance
is used as the predicted pair-wise local quality of the residue (Fig. 1). Higher
distances correspond to poorer local quality.

The reﬁned average pair-wise Q-scores are generated using a consensus
approach (as MULTICOM-CONSTRUCT server in CASP9). APOLLO ﬁrst
uses the average pair-wise similarity scores, calculated in terms of Q-score
(Ben-David et al., 2009; McGufﬁn and Roche, 2010), to generate an initial
ranking of all the models. The Q-score between a pair of residues (1, j) in
the two models is computed as: Qijzexp[—(rfj’-—rg—)2], where r3- and r5-
are the distance between C01 atoms at residue positions 1 and j in models a
and b, respectively. The overall Q-score between models a and b is equal
to the average of all Qij scores of all residue pairs in the entire model. The
average Q-score between a model and all other models is used as the predicted
quality score of the model. The initial quality scores are reﬁned by the same
reﬁnement process used by our hybrid method in MULTICOM-REFINE.

3 RESULTS

We assessed most of the methods used by APOLLO on 107
valid CASP9 targets. We downloaded all the CASP9 models
from CASP9 (http://predictioncenter.org/download_area/CASP9/)
and the experimental structures from the PDB (Berman et (11., 2000).
These PDB ﬁles were preprocessed in order to select correct chains
and residues that match the CASP9 target sequences. TM-Score was
used to align each model with the corresponding native structure and
generate its real quality score (GDT—TS). The CASP9 QA predictions
made by our methods were evaluated against the actual quality
scores by four criteria: average per-target correlation (Cozzetto et (11.,
2009), the average sum of the GDT—TS scores of the top one ranked
models, the overall correlation on all targets and the average loss—
the difference in GDT—TS score between the top ranked model and
the best model (Cozzetto et (11., 2009) (Table 1). The results show
that the average correlation can be as high as 0.92 (respectively,
0.67) and the average loss can be as low as 0.057 (respectively,
0.095) for multiple model (respectively, single model). Our multiple-
and single-model global QA methods were ranked among the
most accurate QA methods of their respective kind according to
the CASP9 ofﬁcial assessment (http://www.predictioncenter.org/
casp9/doc/presentations/CASP9_QA.pdf). The average per-target
correlation of our pair-wise local quality predictions is ~ 0.53, which
is also among the top local quality predictors in CASP9. We also

on the CASP8 dataset) on the CASP9 models of 92 CASP9 single
domain proteins. On the residues whose actual distances to the
native are 3 10 and 20A, the average absolute difference between
our predicted distances and the actual distances is 2.60 and 3.18 A,
respectively.

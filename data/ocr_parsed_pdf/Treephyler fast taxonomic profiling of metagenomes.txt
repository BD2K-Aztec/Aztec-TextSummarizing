ABSTRACT

Summary: Assessment of phylogenetic diversity is a key element
to the analysis of microbial communities. Tools are needed to handle
next-generation sequencing data and to cope with the computational
complexity of large-scale studies. Here, we present ii'eephyler,
a tool for fast taxonomic profiling of metagenomes. ii'eephyler
was evaluated on real metagenome to assess its performance in
comparison to previous approaches for taxonomic profiling. Results
indicate that ii'eephyler is in terms of speed and accuracy prepared
for next-generation sequencing techniques and large-scale analysis.
Availability: ii'eephyler is implemented in Perl; it is portable
to all platforms and applicable to both nucleotide and protein
input data. ii'eephyler is freely available for download at

1 INTRODUCTION

Beyond the analysis of single species genomes of culturable
organisms, metagenomics currently opens a new view on the
exploration of microbial communities. Progress in sequencing
technology enables broader and deeper genomic sampling of the
biosphere which in turn puts new challenges for sequence analysis
methods. Problems arise from the sheer mass and the short length
of sequencing reads. Usually only a small fraction of reads can be
assembled due to the phylogenetic diversity in the samples. In the
ﬁrst instance, large-scale analysis of short metagenomic sequencing
reads has to provide an estimate of the phylogenetic distribution
of the sample. Taxonomic proﬁling achieves this task by assigning
sequencing reads to phylogenetic categories. The most common
methods are based on homology to known genes.

The classical ‘gold standard’ approach to taxonomic proﬁling
in metagenomics is focused on the 165 rRNA gene and
relies on a sufﬁcient number of sequences of that gene in
metagenomic sequence data. Usually the number of reads containing
sufﬁciently long stretches of 165 rRNA is small. Therefore,
several researchers perform deep sequencing of that particular gene
[see e.g. (Hamady and Knight, 2009)]. Although this approach
efﬁciently overcomes the sparseness of 165 rRNA in metagenomic
samples, the sequence data support taxonomic proﬁling only,

without any explicit information about the ﬁlnctional inventory of
microbial communities. Furthermore, l6S analysis does not apply
to metatranscriptomics, an increasingly important approach to direct
measurement of the metabolic activity of microbial communities.
Another way to cope with the small proportion of 165 rRNA in
metagenomic data is to extend the set of marker genes to particular
protein coding genes (Wu and Eisen, 2008). In von Mering et al.
(2007), a set of 31 marker genes for metagenome analysis was
proposed. This principle has been ﬁirther extended in Krause et al.
(2008) where all PFAM protein domains are used as potential
markers. Their tool CARMA searches metagenomic sequences for
PFAM domains and classiﬁes them on the basis of pyhlogenetic
trees built from the metagenome and reference sequences. Although
computationally demanding for large-scale metagenome analysis,
the CARMA approach shows the potential of a dual use of PFAM
domain assignments which not only provides a basis for taxonomic
proﬁling but also for functional proﬁling as well. In principle,
also BLAST-based analysis [MEGAN (Huson et (11., 2007), MG-
RAST (Meyer et (11., 2008)] can achieve both kinds of proﬁling
at the same time because the detected homologies may provide
information about functional and taxonomic relations. However, the
known shortcomings of BLAST-based analysis in metagenomics
include the requirement of a sufﬁcient sequence length and the
existence of close homologues in the reference database. In contrast
to homology-based approaches, several methods pursue the direct
classiﬁcation of the DNA signature of single reads [PhyloPythia
(McHardy et (11., 2007), TACOA (Diaz et (11., 2009), Phymm (Brady
and Salzberg, 2009)]. While previous methods showed a rapidly
decreasing classiﬁcation performance for read lengths <1000 bp,
more recent approaches also seem to perform reasonably well on
short reads. Here, we present a new tool for community proﬁling
in metagenomics and metatranscriptomics which is based on PFAM
domain assignments. Previous methods like the CARMA approach
are limited to small-scale analysis due to computational expense of
homology search and tree inference. Here, we propose an approach
which combines ultra-fast PFAM domain prediction as obtained
from the UFO web server (Meinicke, 2009) with an efﬁcient
phylogenetic method based on fast tree inferences using approximate
maximum likelihood trees (Price et (11., 2009).

2 METHODS

Our algorithm offers fast taxonomic proﬁling to investigate the community
structure of metagenomes. Based on PFAM predictions. e.g. by UFO. pre-
calculated proﬁle Hidden Markov Models of all PFAM families are used to

screen matching sequencing reads for signiﬁcant hits. Reads are classiﬁed
using a phylogenetic tree. For each PFAM family with a sufﬁcient number
of newly assigned sequences, approximate-maximum likelihood trees of
the PFAM database sequences and the matching reads are computed using
FastTree, which combines the speed of minimum-evolution methods with
the accuracy of maximum likelihood methods. Once trees are computed,
Treephyler uses the algorithm of (Nguyen et al., 2006) to classify reads
according to the phylogenetic placement in the tree (see also Treephyler
web site). Treephyler offers an efﬁcient way to balance the computation
load on multi-core computers or computer clusters. By this, the runtime
only depends on the computation of the largest trees. Similar to CARMA,
Treephyler only computes trees for PFAM families with less than 3000
(assigned + reference) sequences.

3 RESULTS

The glacial ice dataset (Simon et al., 2009) was taken as a
reference because of its relatively short read length (~200 bp), the
availability of results from a 165 analysis and the moderate sample
size (~0.2 Gbp). We analysed the glacial ice dataset to assess the
performance of Treephyler in comparison with the tree-based tool
CARMA and the signature-based tool Phymm, and the 165 RNA
reference analysis. The analysis was conducted on a single 2.4 GHZ
dual-core CPU AMD Opteron with 16 Gb RAM.

For runtime comparison, we randomly selected 1% of the glacial
ice dataset to allow the comparison with CARMA. Both Treephyler
and Phymm analysed the reduced dataset in ~25 min, while it
took CARMA l68h to complete the analysis. On the ﬁill dataset,
Treephyler needed only 12 h, while Phymm needed 30h. The
estimated runtime for CARMA is 696 h. The runtime of UFO for
the reduced and the ﬁill dataset was 22 s and ~30 m, respectively.
Results on the ﬁill dataset of Treephyler and CARMA [taken
from (Simon et (11., 2009)] are in good agreement with the 165

analysis, expect for the phyla Bacteroidetes (Phymm: 3%, CARMA:
8%, Treephyler: 9%, 165: 30%) and Betaproteobacteria (P: 21%,
C: 24%, T: 24%, 165: 41%), where all three methods differ from the
165 analysis (see Fig. 1). This may be the consequence of an uneven
taxon sampling of PFAM. Remarkably, Phymm also disagreed on
the phyla Firmicutes (P: 11%, 165: 0%) and Gammaproteobacteria
(P: 21%, 165: 5%). Test data and additional results for the class
level are available at the Treephyler web site.

4 CONCLUSION

We introduced Treephyler, a new tool for fast taxonomic proﬁling
of metagenomes. We evaluated our method on real metagenomic
data by comparison with previous approaches for taxonomic
proﬁling. We could show a close correspondence between the
predicted proﬁles of Treephyler and CARMA, while computational
speed was increased by orders of magnitude. While speed is not
necessarily an essential requirement in genome analysis, the increase
of metagenomic sequence data urges for particularly efﬁcient
techniques, which also work with limited computational resources.
Therefore, the approach we propose here is well prepared for next-
generation sequencing technologies and large-scale studies like the
exploration of the human microbiome.

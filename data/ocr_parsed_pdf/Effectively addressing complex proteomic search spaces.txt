ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein identification by mass spectrometry is commonly
accomplished using a peptide sequence matching search algorithm,
whose sensitivity varies inversely with the size of the sequence data-
base and the number of post-translational modifications considered.
We present the Spectrum Identification Machine, a peptide sequence
matching tool that capitalizes on the high-intensity b1-fragment ion
of tandem mass spectra of peptides coupled in solution with pheny-
lisotiocyanate to confidently sequence the first amino acid and ultim-
ately reduce the search space. We demonstrate that in complex
search spaces, a gain of some 120% in sensitivity can be achieved.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the goals of shotgun proteomics is to perform large-scale
identification and quantitation of thousands of proteins within
complex protein mixtures (e. g. biological fluids or whole-cell lys-
ates). The strategy comprises protein digestion, followed by pep-
tide chromatographic separation online with tandem mass
spectrometry (MS2) (Washburn et al., 2001). The MS2 data
are then generally identified using a peptide sequence matching
(PSM) tool; examples are SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994) and, most
recently, Andromeda (Cox et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, given a peptide’s
precursor ion mass and M82, these algorithms pull out, from a
peptide-sequence database, peptide sequences whose theoretical
mass lies within a given tolerance from the experimental

precursor mass. Following that, theoretical spectra are generated
for all peptide candidates so that some similarity metric, be it
empirical or statistical, can be used to select the most likely can-
didate. Finally, a list of identiﬁcations satisfying some false dis-
covery rate (FDR) is obtained by using a statistical ﬁltering tool
such as SEPro (Carvalho et al., 2012).

The sensitivity of a PSM tool varies inversely with the size of
the sequence database and the number of post-translational
modiﬁcations considered (Yen et al., 2006). Consequently, stu-
dies addressing complex search spaces are challenging when seen
from a computational perspective. Examples are analysing snake
venoms for identifying naturally occurring peptides (Tashima
et al., 2012) or performing a meta-proteomic study of a microor-
ganism biota (Muth et al., 2012). The former requires not tryp-
sinizing the samples and thus lifts the constraints of a PSM
search engine to only tryptic peptides, which results in an expo-
nential growth of the search space; the latter entails the concat-
enation of hundreds of sequence databases of different
organisms. Nevertheless, the rewards at stake could be discover-
ing a naturally occurring peptide with pharmaceutical properties
or the in-depth comprehension of a system’s biology.

Recently, Sanchez et a]. (2010) and Perez-Riverol et a]. (2011)
demonstrated the possibility to identify peptides using the
N—terminal residue and accurate precursor mass; for this, they
coupled peptides in solution with phenylisotiocyanate (PITC).
During the activation in the collision cell, these phenylthiocarba—
moyl-derivatized peptides dissociate to speciﬁcally yield an in-
tense b1 fragment. This unlocks the possibility to conﬁdently
determine the N—terminal residue in a single mass spectrum.
The authors then demonstrated a peptide identiﬁcation tool
that considered only the b1 fragment ion mass and the high
mass accuracy of the precursor and used it to identify peptides
in an Escherichia coli tryptic digest. The shortcomings of this
method are in the inability to discriminate between peptides
with close masses and same first residue. As the remaining
MS2 information is not taken into account, the method is
blind to peptides not found in the database but also coinciding
in mass and first residue, and thus prone to such false positives.

More on these limitations is found in a discussion in the
Supplementary File. In brief, this strategy becomes inapplicable
to studies addressing complex search spaces, where these ‘coin-
cidences’ become increasingly frequent. Notwithstanding this,
the authors demonstrated a way to potentially improve current
PSM algorithms.

2 METHODS

To overcome these limitations, we present the Spectrum Identiﬁcation
Machine (SIM). SIM capitalizes on PITC-coupled peptides to reduce the
search space by ﬁltering peptide candidates to only those satisfying the
precursor mass and the ﬁrst amino acid obtained from the high-intensity
b1 fragment. The reduced search space is then queried by comparing
theoretically generated spectra to experimental ones with a similarity
metric that is the dot product between the normalized experimental
and theoretical spectra, multiplied by the number of matched peaks.
This enables the selection of the highest-scoring candidate sequence.
Some other scores, such as DeltaCN from SEQUEST, are also computed;
in fact, the output of SIM is a .SQT ﬁle (i.e. it has the SEQUEST output
format), which makes every tool that works with SEQUEST automatic-
ally compatible with SIM.

We benchmarked SIM, with results ﬁltered by SEPro to achieve a 1%
FDR (protein level), on a previously published yeast lysate MudPIT
dataset (Barboza et al., 2011) against the widely adopted Andromeda.
We note that this is a non-PITC-labelled dataset; therefore, this bench-
marking was carried out to verify whether SIM would perform accept-
ably. Search parameters and results are available at the SIM website.
In our hands, Andromeda (v. 1.3.0.5) identified 53 997 MS/MS and
SIM (v. 0.905) 73 639 MS/MS, both constrained by the same FDR of
1% at the protein level. This result demonstrates that SIM does have an
effective algorithm for PSM and has allowed us to focus our efforts on
showing the beneﬁts of activating what we term the PITC logic.

We verify the efﬁciency of the PITC logic on a PITC-labelled E.coli
extract that was trypsinized and analysed with a 1-h reversed-phase chro-
matography gradient on an Orbitrap Velos acquiring MS2 in higher
energy collisional dissociation (HCD) mode. To verify how the increase
in database complexity affected the results, we generated three peptide
databases, one comprehending only fully tryptic peptides (one
missed-cleavage accepted and no post-translational modiﬁcations
(PTMs)), the second having a semi-tryptic speciﬁcity and the third with
no enzymatic speciﬁcity. This generated search spaces comprising
566070, 11217794 and 63102231 peptides, respectively. Results were
ﬁltered with SEPro to converge to a list of 1% FDR.

3 RESULTS

Search results with and without the PITC logic are presented
in Figure 1. An example of a PITC peptide tandem mass spec-
trum is found in Supplementary Figure S1. Further comparisons
to the method from Sanchez et al., (2010) are provided in the
Supplementary File.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have searched an E.coli tryptic digest labelled with PITC
using SIM. We performed a proof of concept by testing the
efﬁciency of our new PITC logic under increasing complexities,
i.e. from tryptic to semi-tryptic to fully tryptic, and obtained
an increase in sensitivity of some 120% in a large search space.
As such, the SIM-PITC approach is recommended when ad-
dressing proteomic studies with complex search spaces. SIM

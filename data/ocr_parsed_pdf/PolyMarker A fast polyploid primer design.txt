Abstract

Summary: The design of genetic markers is of particular relevance in crop breeding programs.
Despite many economically important crops being polyploid organisms, the current primer design
tools are tailored for diploid species. Bread wheat, for instance, is a hexaploid comprising of three
related genomes and the performance of genetic markers is diminished if the primers are not gen—
ome specific. PolyMarker is a pipeline that generates SNP markers by selecting candidate primers
for a specified genome using local alignments and standard primer design tools to test the viability
ofthe primers. A command line tool and a web interface are available to the community.

Availability and implementation: PolyMarker is available as a ruby BioGem: bio—polyploid—

tools. Web interface: http://polymarker.tgac.ac.uk.

1 Introduction

Breeding programs rely on dense genetic maps with markers (e.g.
SNPs) that can be used to identify the presence or absence of specific
alleles in homozygous or heterozygous state. Standard primer design
tools are designed to work in diploids, where genome duplications
are rare. Wheat is a polyploid composed of three genomes (A, B and
D; referred to as homoeologues) that are related (between 96 and
98% sequence identity), yet distinct. This creates a problem for the
design of PCR primers specific to an individual homoeologue. A
common approach to circumvent this issue is to manually design pri-
mers with a genome specific variant at the 3’ of the primer to in-
crease specificity. We introduce PolyMarker, a tool to automate the
design of genome specific primers, thereby reducing the time in-
vested in this process. To make PolyMarker accessible to scientists
and breeders, we developed a web server where custom SNPs can be
submitted for the design of genome specific assays.

2 Description of the tool

First, PolyMarker converts the input marker information (chromo-
some arm, sequence adjacent to the SNP and parental alleles) into a

fasta file with the sequences that can be queried to the genomic ref-
erence. The search is performed with Exonerate (Slater and Birney,
2005), with the option —ryo (roll your own format) to facilitate the
parsing. The region flanking the SNP, twice the size of the maximum
amplification product (200 bp for amplification products up to
100 bp), on the best hit of each chromosome is extracted. A local
alignment between homoeologues and paralogues, is refined with
MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013), executed using the binder pro-
vided in bioruby.

The local alignment is used to produce a mask containing
all the variations across homoeologues and the input sequence
(Supplementary Fig. 51). The mask indicates the type of variation on
each position: (i) Specific: homoeologous polymorphism which is
only present in the target genome; (ii) Semi-specific: homoeologous
polymorphism which is found in more than one genome but it dis-
criminates against one of the off-target genomes or when not all the
homoeologous sequences were found; (iii) Non-specific: when no
variation is found across homoeologues; (iv) Homoeologous: The
target SNP is present across different chromosomes and; (v) Non-
homoeologous: The target SNP is not present across chromosomes.
PolyMarker default is to design a three-primer assay for KASP

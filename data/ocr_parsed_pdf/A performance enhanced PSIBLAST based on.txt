ABSTRACT

Motivation: Sequence alignment is one of the most popular tools of
modern biology. NCBl’s PSI-BLAST utilizes iterative model building
in orderto better detect distant homologs with greater sensitivity than
non-iterative BLAST. However, PSI-BLAST’s performance is limited
by the fact that it relies on deterministic alignments. Using a semi-
probabilistic alignment scheme such as Hybrid alignment should
allow for better informed model building and improved identification
of homologous sequences, particularly remote homologs.

Results: We have built a new version of the tool in which the
Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm core is replaced by the hybrid
alignment algorithm. The favorable statistical properties of the
hybrid algorithm allow the introduction of position-specific gap
penalties in Hybrid PSI-BLAST. This improves the position-specific
modeling of protein families and results in an overall improvement of
performance.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sequence alignment is one of the most commonly used tools in
modern biology. The BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1990) and PSI-BLAST
(Altschul et (11., 1997) algorithms have become standard tools for
homology detection. In particular, PSI-BLAST (Altschul et (11.,
1997) iteratively reﬁnes models for a protein family of interest
with the goal of working toward the detection of weaker or more
distant homologs. The detection of deeper evolutionary relationships
can impact many aspects of biology such as the broadness of
evolutionary studies (Dokholyan and Shakhnovich, 2001), the
quality of gene annotations (Bateman et (11., 2002; Schwede et (11.,
2003), protein structure/ﬁinction predictions (Jones, 1999; Zhou and
Zhou, 2005) and our understanding of genes found in metagenomic
surveys (Rondon et (11., 2000). Improving PSI-BLAST has the
potential to affect a large number of users and scientiﬁc applications.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The idea behind PSI-BLAST, or Position Speciﬁc Iterated Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool, is to leverage information from
identiﬁed homologs to create a position-speciﬁc substitution matrix
that can then be used to detect even more distant homologs (Altschul
et (11., 1997). These searches take place in an iterative fashion by
using homologs identiﬁed in the previous round for the model
building phase where the position-speciﬁc substitution matrix is
reﬁned for the next round. While this method increases the sensitivity
of the subsequent searches, the BLAST core imposes a severe
limitation—namely, an inability to incorporate position-speciﬁc gap
costs. This limitation stems from the inability to statistically assess
the signiﬁcance of alignment scores with position-speciﬁc gap costs
on practical timescales.

Here, we overcome this limitation by replacing the alignment
core of PSI-BLAST by the semi-probabilistic hybrid alignment
algorithm (Yu and Hwa, 2001). This algorithm’s main advantage
over the alignment core of NCBI PSI-BLAST is its statistical
tractability, particularly with regards to position-speciﬁc gap
costs (Yu et (11., 2002). In effect, Hybrid alignment introduces to
PSI-BLAST one of the advantages usually reserved for proﬁle
Hidden Markov Models (Eddy, 1998, 2008; Krogh et (11., 1994). The
Hybrid PSI-BLAST software, which we present here, incorporates
the hybrid alignment algorithm for both homolog detection and
model building, thus allowing the use of position-speciﬁc gap costs
that were previously unfeasible. We show that Hybrid PSI-BLAST
represents an improvement to the overall sensitivity and selectivity
of homolog detection in comparison to NCBI PSI-BLAST.

2 METHODS

Hybrid PSI-BLAST has been developed in several steps. Here. we will focus
on novel features. most notably the use of position-speciﬁc gap costs. and
not repeat details already discussed in previous publications. However. we
refer the interested reader to References (Li et (11.. 2004. 2005; Yu and
Hwa, 2001; Yu et (11.. 2002) for more information on the hybrid alignment
algorithm (Yu and Hwa, 2001; Yu et (11.. 2002). its use in building position-
speciﬁc substitution matrices (Li et (11.. 2004) and the incorporation of
information about suboptimal alignments into the model building (Li et (11..
2005). Since even the discussion of these newly implemented features is
rather lengthy and technical. the reader most interested in the outcome of
these is invited to skip directly to the Section 3.

The full Hybrid PSI-BLAST algorithm consists of essentially two major
componentsiHybrid Similarity Search and Hybrid Model Building. We thus
discuss the details of each below.

Many of the implementation details depend on the choice of parameters
such as cutoffs and other constants. We choose these parameters by

optimizing the retrieval performance of the algorithm on a training dataset.
In order to evaluate the performance of our remote homolog detection.
we use SCOP (Andreeva et (11.. 2004; Conte Lo et (11.. 2002; Murzin et (11..
1995) that classiﬁes sequences based on the relatedness of their protein
structures. Speciﬁcally. we use for parameter optimization the ASTRAL40
subset of SCOP version 1.69 (7024 sequences) which contains sequences
with less than 40% sequence identitygensuring that evaluation is based on
the ability to detect remote homologs. These parameters were then frozen and
the performance of Hybrid PSI-BLAST was compared with that of NCBI
PSI-BLAST (see Section 3) on an independent test dataset derived as the
non-overlapping portion of ASTRAL40 version 1.75 (4974 sequences).

2.1 Hybrid similarity search

The goal of this phase is the identiﬁcation of homologous sequences for
inclusion in future model building phases. Since the gapless version of the
hybrid and the classical Smith7Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman.
1981) are identical. Hybrid PSI-BLAST retains the word search heuristics
of NCBI BLAST (Altschul et (11.. 1990. 1997) for narrowing the list of
candidate sequences. The full hybrid alignment algorithm is then used on
these candidate sequences to determine whether or not they are homologs.

The hybrid alignment algorithm (Yu and Hwa, 2001) was so named
because it contains features of both deterministic (Pearson and Lipman. 1988;
Smith and Waterman. 1981) and probabilistic alignment algorithms (Durbin
et (11.. 1998; Hughey and Krogh. 1996; Loytynoja and Milinkovitch. 2003).
In particular. this semi-probabilistic algorithm measures sequence homology
according to the maximum log-likelihood score:

(I): max (anM) (1)
lgigM,
lgjgN

where Zw- is the probabilistic likelihood score at sequence alignment
positions i and j. and M and N represent the subject and query sequence
lengths. respectively. Then. as in the case of deterministic alignment. the
maximum score is used as the basis for evaluating sequence homology.

The signiﬁcance of these scores can be assessed by using the same
universal distribution derived for the case of gapless local alignment (Dembo
et (11.. 1994; Karlin and Altschul. 1990; Karlin and Dembo. 1992)

E(<I>) =KMNe—M’ (2)

where K and A are the typical mode and tail parameters of the extremal
distribution (Fisher and Tippett. 1928). However. in the case of hybrid
alignment. we know a priori that A21 for appropriately chosen scoring
weights even in the presence of position-speciﬁc gap costs (Yu and Hwa,
2001)7a fact that we will exploit in this work. [The same feature is also
known for proﬁle Hidden Markov models (Eddy. 2008).] Thus. only the
value of K needs to be evaluated in order to assess the statistical signiﬁcance
of our sequence hits.

2.2 Model building

There are a number of aspects to model building: choosing sequences
to include in the model. weighing the contribution of each sequence
appropriately and ﬁnally generating the position-speciﬁc scoring matrix
(PSSM) that will act as the query in the next round.

2.2.1 Choosing sequences Sequences to be included in the model are
chosen based on an E-Value cutoff. In order to calculate E-Values using
Equation (2). the parameters K and A have to be known. While A21 is
ﬁxed. K depends on the scoring system. Thus. we recalculate the value of K
in each round based on the new search model. More speciﬁcally. we use the
island method (Altschul et (11.. 2001) which determines the value of K from
aligning random sequences of length 2000 amino acids to a model of length
2000 generated by concatenating several copies of the new search model.
The length of 2000 is chosen in order to minimize edge effects. The number
of such alignments is dynamically adjusted such that a statistical error of 5%

on the estimated value of K is achieved. Similarly. the island method is used
to estimate in every round the parameters H and ﬂ (Altschul and Gish. 1996;
Altschul et (11.. 2001). which are used to correct the length dependence of
the E-Values (Li et (11.. 2004).

The actual choice of the inclusion threshold has to be empirically
determined. A higher value will allow detection of more homologs but also
increases the risk of model corruption by inclusion of false positives. After
trying several cutoffs in steps of factors of 10, we settled on a cutoff of
0.0001. The fact that this is lower than the default cutoff of NCBI PSI-
BLAST (0.005) is a reﬂection of the fact that the more detailed models with
variable gap costs recognize homologs even at a smaller threshold.

While the database search itself is not much more computationally
expensive using the hybrid algorithm than with the Smith7Waterman core.
model building can become a major computational bottleneck if a very large
number of homologs of the query are found. In order to avoid this bottleneck.
we set an upper limit of 500 sequences that are included in the model building.
If less than 500 homologs are found. all are used for model building. If more
than 500 homologs are found. 500 of them are randomly sampled from
the total list of homologs. Using this cutoff ensures that the computational
load of Hybrid PSI-BLAST remains similar to that of NCBI PSI-BLAST. In
practice. our version of Hybrid PSI-BLAST is about 273 times slower than
NCBI PSI-BLAST on the same hardware.

Lastly. the ends of the sequences to be included in the model building have
to be determined. It is important to focus only on highly scoring subsequences
since otherwise residues are included in model building that are irrelevant
for the protein family in question which can lead to the inclusion of non-
homologs in the model in later rounds. Smith7Waterman alignment directly
provides a beginning and end of its high scoring path. In hybrid alignment.
the end is still well-deﬁned but there is no beginning of the path. Instead of
a hard beginning. there is a probability at each model position that the high
scoring alignment has already started. For the purpose of model building. we
deﬁne the beginning of the alignment to be the position where this probability
exceeds 0.95 for the ﬁrst time. In order to minimize contributions from
neighboring domains to the model for the next round. we shorten the so
determined sequence by three amino acids on each end.

2.2.2 Sequence weighting Since the sequence weighting algorithm in the
original PSI-BLAST is based on the multiple alignment which in turn is a
result of the Smith7Waterman algorithm. we had to develop an alternative
sequence weighting scheme that is based on the quantities provided by the
hybrid algorithm. In developing this weighting scheme. we strive to stay as
close as possible to the intent of the NCBI PSI-BLAST weights. i.e. prevent
sample biases in the database from dominating the query models (Altschul
et (11.. 1997).

The quantity calculated from the Smith7Waterman multiple alignment in
the original PSI-BLAST is the weighted number of times an amino acid A
occurs in column j of the multiple alignment. which yields the normalized
frequency (ILA of amino acid A at model position j. This quantity is later
used to determine the substitution score for amino acid A at position j. In
the original PSI-BLAST. its initial value (1113A is calculated by summing the
weights of all sequences that contain the amino acid A at position j of the
Smith7Waterman alignment with the query PSSM. Especially if the number
of sequences in the multiple alignment is small. a matrix derived directly
from the (1113A may overﬁt the data. Thus. NCBI PSI-BLAST calculates the
ﬁnal frequencies using the pseudocount approach

NCBI group (Schaffer et (11.. 2001) for optimal retrieval performance. The
pseudocounts gLA themselves are calculated from the raw counts (1113A by
using the original non-position-speciﬁc matrix. such as BLOSUM62. for

Hybrid PSI-BLAST

 

It is fairly natural to switch most of the model building process from
Smith7Waterman alignments to hybrid alignments and take advantage of the
information buried in suboptimal alignments. Instead of simply counting how
often an amino acid A occurs in column j of the Smith7Waterman multiple
alignment. we use the posterior probabilities Pr(A,j,XlQ) of ﬁnding amino
acid A in sequence X at column j of the multiple alignment under the protein
family model 9. These probabilities can be readily obtained from the results
of the forward and backward algorithms [the details of which can be found
in (Yu et (11.. 2002)] as

ZilxizA  _ 1) i

stunt-

Pr(A,JIX|9) = (4)

where  and  are the forward and backwards match weights at positions i
and j in the subject and query sequences. respectively. and ZSEME is the
likelihood score satisfying Equation (1). Summing these over all sequences

and normalizing yields

ZXPr(A,j,X|Q)

gm = Zxﬂpﬂﬂjjjm). (5)

If the optimal alignment between sequence X and model 52 is dominant. its
probability will be the leading term in Pr(A , j ,X lfl). In this case. Pr(A , j ,X | Q)
has a single peak that is close to 1 for the amino acid A appearing in the
optimal alignment and 0 for the other 19 amino acids. Thus. we simply
‘count’ the dominant amino acid in this position in the same way as done
in the original PSI-BLAST. Otherwise. the distribution of Pr(A,j,XlQ) is
ﬂatter. A single sequence will contribute more than one amino acid to the
multiple alignment at column j albeit with a reduced weight reﬂecting the
uncertainty of the alignment at this position.

The goal of the weighting scheme is to calculate for every position j of the
PSSM an effective number of sequences 01]— to be used in the pseudocount
Equation (3) and a weight WXJ' for each sequence X. In the original PSI-
BLAST. only sequences that have a match or mismatch at position j are
used to calculate these quantities for position j. i.e. sequences with a gap at
position j or the local alignment of which starts past position j or ends before
position j do not contribute to these quantities. In addition. only the columns
of the multiple alignment from an interval [1]; rj] contribute in which none
of the sequences that contribute have a gap or end.

In hybrid alignment. gaps and beginnings of alignments are not well
deﬁned but rather probabilistic in nature (the end of an alignment is. however.
still well deﬁned). Thus. we ﬁrst introduce the probability

zXJ-Ezprmjxm) (6)

that sequence X has any amino acid at position j in the probabilistic alignment
(i.e. the complement of the probability that sequence X has a gap or not yet
started or already ended at position j). We then introduce an arbitrary cutoff
r = 0.95 and treat sequences with tXJ- > r as having an amino acid at positionj
and the others as not having an amino acid at position j. This allows us to
deﬁne

.X}E{X|lx,j>f} 
as the set of sequences relevant for position j. The boundaries of the interval
of positions relevant for position j then are given by

lj 7 minileXeXfVm:k..th,m > T} 

rj maxikIVXE.X}VItz:j...ktX,m > T} 
that is. they are the maximal choices of columns surrounding position j
between which all of the sequences relevant for position j have at least
probability 1' for an amino acid.

In order to calculate the weight WXJ' for sequence X at position j. we ﬁrst
calculate the ‘frequencies’

13-11: 2 Prm.k.XIs2> (10)
XeX/

of amino acid A at position k for all sequences that are relevant at position j.
These are determined for all positions k =1]— . . .rj. Following the original

PSI-BLAST weighting scheme. the contribution of amino acid A at position
k is the inverse of the frequency ﬁg“; of this amino acid times the inverse
of the total number

ITjng#{AU§-gk,A>0} (11)
of amino acids that occur at all at position k. Since the Pr(A, k,X | 9) determine
the probability of seeing amino acid A at position k in sequence X, the total
weight nggx contributed by position k to sequence X is

(which we take to be zero ifﬁym = 0 which implies Pr(A, k,X|§2)= 0). Since
sequence X contributes to the alignment at position k with probability tX,k,
the total weight for sequence X e  at position j is proportional to

1:1,

The unnormalized weights w/XJ- of sequences X ¢  that are not relevant
for position j are set to zero. Finally. the actual weights WXJ' are calculated
from the w/XJ- by normalizing them at each position j.

In order to calculate the effective number of sequences 01]— at position j.
we ﬁrst determine the diversity DJ- of each position j. In the original PSI-
BLAST. the diversity is the number of different amino acids that occur in
this column of the multiple alignment. We replace this by the number of
different amino acids that are the highest probability amino acid at position j
within their sequence for all relevant sequences X e  In order to calculate
011-, the diversities are averaged over all positions k between max{j—5,lj}
and min{j+5,rj}. i.e. over all positions from the relevant interval but no
further away from j than ﬁve (the original PSI-BLAST weighting scheme
uses the whole interval [1]; rj] but we found that further restricting the number
of positions over which to average gives better results). 01]— is obtained by
subtracting one from this average. since an average of one corresponds to
all relevant sequences agreeing with the query sequence in which case no
additional information can be retrieved from the identiﬁed homologs at this
position. Thus. just like in the original PSI-BLAST weighting scheme. 01]— is
a number between zero and the alphabet size minus one.

Given the sequence weights WXJ' and the effective numbers of sequences
011-. the raw ‘frequencies’ are determined as

Equation (3) is applied to determine the ﬁnal frequencies (1ng which. in turn.
are used to calculate the new PSSM.

(I’M = (14)

2.2.3 PSSM There are two major parts to determining the PSSM: the
amino acid substitution. i.e. match or mismatch. and the gap. i.e. insertion or
deletion. weights. The substitution weights are dealt with in a similar way to
NCBI’s PSI-BLAST (Altschul et (11.. 1997) with the inclusion of amino acid
probabilities instead of a discrete alignment. and has already been described
in detail by Li et a1. (2005). Therefore. here we will focus on the inclusion
of position-speciﬁc gap costs.

The main advantage of using the hybrid algorithm is that it allows position-
speciﬁc gap costs in a natural way. In order to use position-speciﬁc gap
costs. the PSSM has to be extended to include the substitution weight W and
the gap weights 1111-1. 1111-2. pvt-)1. pvt-)2. v],- and up for every model position j.
Correspondingly. the implementations of the (forward and backward) hybrid
algorithm have to be modiﬁed to use these position-speciﬁc gap weights
instead of the constant weights derived from the gap penalties supplied by
the user.

During the ﬁrst round of the iterative process. the additional parameters of
the PSSM are initialized from the gap initiation cost 8 and the gap extension
cost 6 supplied by the user. Speciﬁcally. they are calculated (Y u et (11.. 2002)
from the two parameters p. Eexp[—Aug(8+e)] and VEexp(—Auge) where

alignment algorithm and of its parameters can be found in Li (2006). Note.
that probability conservation requires in the framework of hybrid alignment
that the weight for a gap initiation is split into the two pairs of contributions
(11’ 1 ,0“) and (110 1 ,1102 ). respectively. The major question is how to choose
these parameters in the subsequent iterations based on the subject sequences
identiﬁed in the previous rounds.

A straightforward approach to answer this question is closely modeled
after the determination of the substitution scores in the PSSM. From the
results of the forward and backward algorithm. we can calculate for each
sequence X and each position j the probability

Calculating the insertion extension weight. 12’ is different from calculating
the deletion extension weight. since a deletion contains only at most a single
gap at model position j while in case of an insertion the complete insertion
occurs in a single model position j. Thus. the essential quantity to extract
from the results of the forward and backward algorithms is

which is the average number of insertion nodes Visited at model position j or
the average length of an insertion times the probability of having an insertion

X

Since this quantity is the average length of an insertion times the probability
that an insertion takes place. and (11131112 calculated in Equation (19) is the
probability that an insertion takes place. the average length of an insertion
given that an insertion takes place is L; / qu, M12. This average length has to
be translated into a value of vi. To this end. we note that every insertion at
position j Visits the ﬁrst insertion node. The probability to Visit the second
insertion node is vi. the probability to Visit the third insertion node is (12152.
etc. Thus. the length distribution of an insertion is geometric with average
1 / (1 — 1211.). Equating this to the measured average length of an insertion ﬁnally
yields
vf’ 2(le —qu,M12)/Lj. (28)
The remaining two weights 1101 and p.11 depend on the others through
normalization conditions and will be discussed at the end of this subsection.
Just as with the substitution weights. the transition weights determined
in this way may be overﬁtting the data if there is only a small number of
sequences contributing at model position j. Thus. we subject the raw weights

W e {n/,;1[2’,;102’, 120’, 12”} to a pseudocount correction:
Ol-Wi +13 W0
W]- : —] J g (29)

where 01]— is the number of sequences contributing to positon j as calculated
by the weighting scheme just as in Equation (3). ﬁg is a user-deﬁned
pseudo-count constant which can a priori be different from the pseudo-count
constant 135 for the substitution weights. and W0 is the original value of the
corresponding weight according to Equation (15). We ﬁnd [33:1 to be a
good choice of the pseudocount constant.

This choice of pseudocount constant is lower than the value of 135 = 10 for
the substitutions. This means that the presence or absence of gaps at a position
of the model could have a strong inﬂuence on the ability of ﬁnding homologs
with gaps at novel positions. Instead of increasing the pseudocount constant.
we take a more reﬁned approach. Gaps tend to correspond to loops in the
protein and thus tend to occur in model positions that show lower levels
of conservation. Thus. the expectation of gaps should be informed by the
level of conservation in the corresponding positions as already implemented
long ago in CLUSTALW (Thompson et (11.. 1994). We thus calculate the

of the substitution scores at each position j and average these over positions
j—2,...,j+2 when calculating gap weights at position j. If this average is

of conservation and we increase the weight for not having a gap by replacing
10 by (1 + 11]) / 2. If on the other hand. the average information content is below
the threshold. we cap the weight W for not having a gap at (1 +110) / 2 where

no is the user provided value of 17 for the ﬁrst round of searches according to
Equation (15). In any case. the value of 10 is capped on the bottom at 0.001 to
always allow some probability for not having a gap and to avoid numerical
artifacts. Once W is changed. the corresponding change is applied equally to
1111-2 and pvt-)2 in order to continue to fulﬁll the normalization condition that
requires those three values to add up to one.

Lastly. to avoid numerical artifacts. the weights vjp and v; are capped at
a minimum of 0.0001 and a maximum of 0.9999. Then. the normalization
conditions for the weights are used to calculate the two remaining weights

3 RESULTS

Using the parameter values we identiﬁed using SCOP v1.69, we
measure the performance of both NCBI and Hybrid PSI-BLAST
by comparison against an independent dataset that derives from
the ASTRAL40 subset of SCOP v1.75. Of the 10569 sequences
in the ASTRAL40 subset of SCOP v1.75, 4974 are not contained in
the ASTRAL40 subset of SCOP v1.69. We use the new sequences as
an independent set of queries for testing the performance of Hybrid
and NCBI PSI-BLAST.

We use version 2.2.18 of NCBI PSI-BLAST and Hybrid PSI-
BLAST as described above to search the NCBI nr database for
homologs of the query sequences in ASTRAL SCOP v1.75 that
are not in ASTRAL SCOP v1.69 and save the resulting models after
each round. These models are then used to search the ASTRAL
SCOP v1.75 database and we ask how many proteins identiﬁed by
NCBI and Hybrid PSI-BLAST are in agreement or disagreement
by plotting the number of true versus false hits that occur, ordered
by E-value. In order to determine which hits are true and which
are false, we use the SUPERFAMILY evaluation ruleset for SCOP
1.69 benchmarks (Gough et (11., 2001; Madera et (11., 2004) which
classiﬁes each pair of sequences in SCOP as either homologs,
non-homologs or undecidable. In general, two sequences in the
same SCOP superfamily are considered as homologs, sequences in
different folds are considered non-homologs and sequences in the
same fold but different superfamily are considered undecidable. The
authors of the evaluation ruleset also include a number of exceptions
from this general Classiﬁcation scheme for common folds such as
Rossmann folds and TIM barrels, as well as for individual sequences
deemed to be misclassiﬁed by SCOP after manual inspection. Since
a newer version of the ruleset is not available, we manually veriﬁed
that none of the sequences covered by speciﬁc exceptions in the
ruleset change Classiﬁcation between version 1.69 and 1.75. For the
purpose of evaluating the algorithms, we ignore hits classiﬁed as
undecidable.

The round by round results for NCBI PSI-BLAST are shown in
Figure 1. From this plot, one can see the effects of the rather classic
problem of model corruption in iterative approaches. As previously
reported (Altschul et (11., 1997), NCBI PSI-BLAST performance
initially improves in subsequent rounds, but then becomes worse
past round 4 due to inclusion of a large number of non-homologs in
the building of the query models.

Hybrid PSI-BLAST exhibits very little model corruption up to
round 7, as shown in Figure 2. The robustness of Hybrid PSI-
BLAST to model corruption in early rounds differentiates it from

Coverage

Fig. 1. NCBI PSI-BLAST round by round coverage versus errors per query.
Coverage is plotted as the number of true hits identiﬁed by PSI-BLAST over
the number of homologs in the database described in the main text. Errors
per query are determined as the number of false hits over the total number of
queries. Coverage versus errors per query are then plotted after sorting the
hits by E-Value. Here. we show the results for subsequent iterative rounds of
NCBI PSI-BLAST from rounds 2 to 6. Round 1 consists of a pure BLAST
search against the initial query. Round 2 is the ﬁrst round in which a model is
used for identifying homologs. We identify round 4 as providing the optimal
trade-off between coverage and errors. This plot shows the sensitivity of
the NCBI PSI-BLAST results to the number of iterations. The increasing
number of early false hits in later rounds stems from model corruptioniie
from the inclusion of non-homologs in the query models.

Coverage

Fig. 3. Coverage versus errors per query for NCBI and Hybrid PSI-BLAST.
The best iterative rounds of NCBI PSI-BLAST (round 4). Hybrid PSI-
BLAST (round 6) and Hybrid PSI-BLAST without position-speciﬁc gap
costs (round 4) are compared on the basis of the fraction of true hits found
per fraction of false hits. Hybrid PSI-BLAST with position-speciﬁc gap costs
performs better than both NCBI PSI-BLAST and ﬁxed gap cost Hybrid PSI-
BLAST. as can be seen from the fact that the Hybrid PSI-BLAST curve is
downward and to the right. indicating that more homologs with fewer non-
homologs were identiﬁed by Hybrid PSI-BLAST in comparison to NCBI
PSI-BLAST. The difference between the ﬁxed gap cost case and full Hybrid
PSI-BLAST shows how much improvement is the result implementing
position-speciﬁc gap costs.

Finally, we plot the best rounds for both algorithms and compare
their overall performances. Figure 3 shows that Hybrid PSI-BLAST
performs measurably better than NCBI PSI-BLAST. In order to
determine if this improvement is due to the position-speciﬁc gap cost
or due to the other changes in the algorithm, we repeat the evaluation
of Hybrid PSI-BLAST keeping the gap weights constant at their
initial value while keeping all other parameters the same. Figure 4
shows that in this case the model corruption effects are present but
not as severe as for NCBI PSI-BLAST. Adding the performance of
the best round of ﬁxed gap cost Hybrid PSI-BLAST to Figure 3, we
ﬁnd that its performance is between that of NCBI and ﬁill Hybrid
PSI-BLAST in the low coverage region. However, in the higher
coverage region Hybrid PSI-BLAST without position-speciﬁc gap
costs performs worse than NCBI PSI-BLAST. We thus conclude that
incorporating position-speciﬁc gap costs indeed improves detection
of remote homologies.

4 DISCUSSION

This work implements a version of PSI-BLAST that incorporates the
semi-probabilistic hybrid alignment scheme. This alignment scheme
allows for the use of position-speciﬁc gap costs and information
from suboptimal alignments in the model building phase, resulting
in overall more accurate homology searches than NCBI PSI-BLAST.
The relevance of our result is that we have shown how to improve
the very core of PSI-BLAST, i.e. the alignment engine, which
was already backed by a long record of scientiﬁc scrutiny and
sound theoretical foundations (Altschul et (11., 1990, 1997). Our
performance improvements are orthogonal, and therefore potentially
cumulative, to those brought about by more recent advances on

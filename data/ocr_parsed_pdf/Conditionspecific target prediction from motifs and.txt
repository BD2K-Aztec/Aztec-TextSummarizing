ABSTRACT

Motivation: It is commonplace to predict targets of transcription fac-
tors (T Fs) by sequence matching with their binding motifs. However,
this ignores the particular condition of the cells. Gene expression data
can provide condition-specific information, as is, e.g. exploited in Motif
Enrichment Analysis.

Results: Here, we introduce a novel tool named condition-specific
target prediction (CSTP) to predict condition-specific targets for TFs
from expression data measured by either microarray or RNA-seq.
Based on the philosophy of guilt by association, CSTP infers the regu-
lators of each studied gene by recovering the regulators of its co-
expressed genes. In contrast to the currently used methods, CSTP
does not insist on binding sites of TFs in the promoter of the target
genes. CSTP was applied to three independent biological processes
for evaluation purposes. By analyzing the predictions for the same TF
in three biological processes, we confirm that predictions with CSTP
are condition-specific. Predictions were further compared with true TF
binding sites as determined by ChIP-seq/chip. We find that CSTP
predictions overlap with true binding sites to a degree comparable
with motif-based predictions, although the two target sets do not
coincide.

interface at http://ostpmolgen.mpg.de.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression is regulated at different levels, and one import-
ant level is transcriptional regulation (Levine and Tjian, 2003).
Transcription factors (TFs) bind to promoter regions of genes
and induce or repress expression of the target gene. This may
further drive downstream cellular processes (Thomas and
Chiang, 2006). Understanding of regulatory processes at the
transcriptional level is essential in understanding the regulation
of biological processes. It remains a great challenge for compu-
tational biologists to develop effective methods for identifying
transcriptional regulatory interactions, given available sequences
and expression data.

To investigate transcriptional regulation, one popular strategy
is, for a given TF, to ﬁnd genes with the binding motif in their
promoters and those genes are supposed to be regulated by the

TF. Many computational tools, such as MATCH (Kel et al.,
2003), TFBS (Lenhard and Wasserman, 2002) and TRAP
(Roider et al., 2007), have been developed based on this strategy.
These tools rely on the description of the TF binding sites in the
form of a position weight matrix (PWM). PWM-based methods
have been widely used in recovering transcriptional targets in
many biological processes.

The shortcomings of PWM-based methods become apparent
when comparing their results with experimental data like gene
expression measurements or TF location as determined by chro-
matin immunoprecipitation with subsequent array hybridization
or sequencing (ChIPwhip/Chip—seq). All types of discrepancies
can be observed: PWM matches may not appear to be bound as
determined by ChIP (Consortium, 2012). Targets predicted
based on the PWM method may not be affected in the studied
biological process (Ong and Corces, 2011). On the other hand,
TFs may bind in places where there is no binding motif and
expression may change even though a gene’s promoter lacks a
binding site. All this is not surprising, though, given the fact that
PWM-based prediction is a static sequence-based prediction that
remains ignorant of the condition of the cell. Thus, the problem
of prediction of transcriptional targets is an ill-posed one as long
as it only considers sequence and ignores the condition of the
cell.

One way to include the condition of the cell, in a rudimentary
manner, is by determining common regulatory factors of co-
expressed genes. Here, the condition of the cell enters through
the co-expression. This approach forms the basis of what is
called ‘overrepresentation analysis’ or ‘motif-enrichment’ (Ho
et al., 2007; Marstrand et al., 2008; Roider et al., 2009;
Zambelli et al., 2009). In overrepresentation analysis, TF binding
motifs are searched in the promoter of each of the co-expressed
genes and then the fraction of genes possessing a certain TF
binding motif is judged based on statistical considerations. A
TF that is signiﬁcantly enriched is assumed to regulate its targets
among the co-expressed genes. An underlying assumption is that
co-expressed genes are co-regulated. One caveat, of course, is
that due to the cascades of gene regulation, a co-expressed
group may be due to many TFs acting serially, rather than one
TF being responsible for all observed expression changes.

In this article, we extend overrepresentation analysis and put
forward a strategy ‘CSTP’ to perform condition-specific target
prediction within a speciﬁc biological process. In CSTP, we
determine the co-expressed genes for each studied gene and
then apply overrepresentation analysis to predict their potential
regulators. Based on a philosophy of guilt by association, we
make a key assumption that a regulator for the co-expressed

group will in particular regulate its centroid gene, which is called
core gene. Thus, the result of a CSTP prediction is a set of pre-
dicted TFetarget relationships between TFs that have been iden-
tified by overrepresentation analysis and core genes that are used
as the centroid of co-expressed groups. Because the regulators
are inferred from such a group of co—expressed genes, there is no
strict requirement that the predicted target actually possesses the
respective binding site in its promoter. Thus, one can in principle
predict regulatory interactions even in the absence of a binding
motif in the promoter. The prediction also reﬂects the condition
of the cell Via the co-expression patterns. CSTP has been imple-
mented as a web-based tool that takes user-provided expression
data and outputs regulatory interactions between predicted TFs
and genes.

2 METHODS
2.1 Prediction with CSTP for transcriptional regulation

The main idea underlying CSTP prediction is to infer transcriptional
regulators for each studied gene by recovering the regulators of its co-
expressed genes, as these are assumed to also regulate the gene in ques-
tion. Therefore, we indirectly infer regulators of one gene through
overrepresentation analysis of its co-expressed genes. If any TF is
found to be overrepresented, this TF is predicted to regulate expression
of the studied gene. This process is repeated for all genes and ﬁnally, the
transcriptional regulation for all studied genes can be recovered with
CSTP.

2.2 Core genes

Core genes are genes that are treated as centroids to ﬁnd co-expressed
gene groups. Only their regulators will be predicted with CSTP.
Therefore, core genes should be genes that are transcriptionally regulated
in the studied biological process. Experimental and computational meth-
ods can be used to ﬁnd core genes. One way is to ﬁnd genes with differ-
ential expression between different conditions. In this work, all the core
genes in investigated experiments are determined by differential expres-
sion analysis between treated samples and control (or untreated samples).
Differential expression analysis of microarray data is performed with R
package SAM (Tusher et al., 2001), which can assign a q-value to each
gene for its signiﬁcance of differential expression. A cutoff is chosen,
above which differentially expressed genes are treated as core genes.
Other methods can also be used to ﬁnd core genes, such as choosing
genes with enough expression variances, which is especially useful to
time-series data without control. With the implementation of CSTP,
users are required to determine which genes are to be treated as core
genes and can choose methods based on their needs.

2.3 Co-expressed gene groups

For each core gene, we ﬁnd its co-expressed gene group as follows. First,
an expression vector, which describes the gene expression profile, is as-
signed to each gene with its expression values at different conditions as
elements. For time-series data, each condition is one time point. Then, the
expression similarities of gene pairs are measured with Pearson’s correl-
ation r between their expression vectors. Only those gene pairs with r
greater than a certain threshold are considered to be co-expressed.
Finally, the co-expressed gene group of core gene 1' is determined by
selecting all of its co-expressed genes. Those co-expressed gene groups
will be used for overrepresentation analysis. Based on our previous evalu-
ation of overrepresentation analysis (Meng et al., 2010), groups with an
insufficient number of genes (e.g. <60 genes) are removed and not further
analyzed. For those groups with >200 genes, genes will be sorted by

descending r values, and only the top 200 genes of the list are used for
analysis.

2.4 Overrepresentation analysis

Overrepresentation analysis is used to recover the transcriptional regula-
tors of a co-expressed gene group. We built a local version of an
overrepresentation analysis tool based on the method of oPOSSUM (ver-
sion 2.0) (Ho et al., 2007). It combines phylogenetic foot-printing and
motif similarity to predict the TF binding sites and evaluates their enrich-
ment with Fisher’s exact test and z-score. We use 474 PWMs from three
different sources, including the J aspar Database (Bryne et al., 2008),
published work (Badis et al., 2009) and the Transfac Database (June
2007). Parameters, used by overrepresentation analysis, are determined
based on the evaluation in our previous work (Meng et al., 2010), in
which overrepresentation analysis was evaluated in 33 microarray experi-
ments with clear molecular contexts, e.g. TF knockout versus control. All
the parameters, including promoter length (from —2000 to +2000 bp),
sequence conservation (top 30%), gene number (200), expression similar-
ity (> 0.6) and cutoff (z > 40 and P < 0.01) are chosen to make sure of the
optimal performance of overrepresentation analysis. Detailed description
for overrepresentation analysis is available in the ‘Methods’ section of
Supplementary Materials.

3.2 CSTP identiﬁes TF targets in estrogen
stimulation process

Before proceeding to a more systematic evaluation, we present
an example application of CSTP. We took microarray data
from Lin et a]. (2007) as an example. In this experiment,
MCF7 cells were treated either with estradiol (estrogen) or
control, and the expression levels of genes were measured
with microarray at three time points: 12, 24 and 48 h. Each
time point was repeated with three chips. Therefore, 18 micro-
arrays were available to ﬁnd differentially expressed and co-
expressed genes.

Core genes were determined by differential expression analysis
between estrogen-treated samples and control. At a cutoff of
q<0.001, 1191 and 864 genes were observed to be up- and
downregulated, respectively. Those differentially expressed
genes were used as core genes to ﬁnd their transcriptional regu-
lators. Among them, we also observed some TF genes, which
included 16 upregulated TF genes and 25 downregulated TF
genes (Supplementary Fig. S1). Interestingly, expression of estro-
gen receptor alpha gene (ESRl) was signiﬁcantly downregulated,
which suggests that there may be some feedback loops to smooth
estrogen stimulation effects by downregulating the expression of
estrogen receptor (ER) gene.

Co—expressed gene groups of core genes were determined with
the same microarray data and then CSTP was applied to recover
the transcriptional regulation. As a result, 4373 TF-target pairs
were predicted with CSTP. Of 2055 core genes, CSTP identiﬁed
regulators for 1823 of them (88.7%). Among the core genes,
there were 16 TF genes that were upregulated and 9 of them
were predicted to take regulatory roles. For 25 downregulated
TFs, 13 of them were also predicted to take regulatory roles. Of
all TFs, MYC regulated the highest number of core genes,
namely, 1106 of 2055. ERs, themselves TFs, were also predicted
to regulate 807 genes.

Before usage of overrepresentation analysis, we have evaluated
its performance with simulation data by randomly assigning
a group of genes to be co-expressed, and estimated the false-
positive prediction ratio for each TF binding motifs. With
those ratios, we checked the probability to observe TFs to regu-
late such number of target genes. Testing based on a binomial
distribution suggested that predicted TFetarget pairs were im-
possible to be random (see Supplementary Methods and
Supplementary Table S1).

3.3 Expression similarity between predicted TF and
target genes

Above, we applied CSTP to predict TFetarget regulation in the
estrogen simulation process. If those predictions reﬂect true tran-
scriptional regulation, expression of target genes is supposed to
be dependent on that of TF genes. Therefore, TF and its target
gene were expected to have similar or inversely similar expression
patterns. Using ER as an example, we investigated this
hypothesis.

We calculated the Pearson’s correlation between expression of
ESRl and its target genes to describe their expression similarity.
The smoothed histogram of those correlation values is shown in
Figure 2. We found that most of the target genes had either
strong positive or negative correlations with the ESRl gene in
expression pattern, which is in line with our expectations. In the
same histogram, we also show the distribution of expression
similarity with core genes that are not predicted to be regulated
by ER. Genes without predicted ER regulation also showed ex-
pression similarity with the ESRl gene, which might be due to
indirect regulation by ER. However, genes with predicted ER
regulation had stronger correlation peaks than genes without
predicted ER regulation. Therefore, we used a Wilcoxon rank
sum test to evaluate their correlation differences. The absolute
values of correlation were used. Results show a signiﬁcant dif-
ference at P<2.2e—16, which suggests that genes with predicted
ER regulation have a significantly stronger expression similarity
or inverse similarity to ER than those without predicted ER
regulation.

We also randomly chose genes from the genome and checked
their expression similarity to the ESRl gene. We observed an
expression peak near r :0, while no correlation peak near
r=l or r = —1 (see Fig. 2), which was different from that of
genes with or without predicted ER regulation. This result fur-
ther validates expression similarity or inverse similarity between
ESRl and its target genes, supporting the validity of the CSTP

predictions. To be confident, we also performed the same evalu-
ation on other TFs and their predicted target genes. As above,
most TF genes and their predicted target genes have more posi-
tive or negative similarity, which is in line with evaluation results
for ER (see Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.4 Validation of ER predictions based on other datasets

In the work of Lin et a]. (2007), they not only performed micro-
array analysis but also investigated whole-genome ER binding
sites with ChIPePET. Finally, 234 genes were found to be asso-
ciated with high-conﬁdent ER binding sites, 139 of which were
also differentially expressed in response to estrogen simulation.

We used those ER binding genes that were determined by
ChIPePET, to evaluate the performance of CSTP. Based on
CSTP predictions, we classiﬁed all the core genes into two
groups: genes with predicted ER regulation and genes without
predicted ER regulation. Then we checked their overlap ratio to
genes with conﬁrmed ER binding sites, respectively. Fisher’s
exact test was used to evaluate their ratio difference. Eighty of
807 predicted ER-regulated genes were validated with true ER
binding sites, whereas only 59 of the 1252 genes without pre-
dicted ER regulation had ER binding sites. The P—Value of
Fisher’s exact test was 4.47e — 6, which suggests a signiﬁcant
ratio differences between the two groups. This indicates that
those genes with predicted ER regulation were more likely to
have true ER binding sites.

Besides the ChIPePET results, we also used independent
ChIP—seq data to validate our prediction. One example was
from Kong et a]. (2011), where the binding sites of ER were
detected with ChIP-seq in MCF7 cells. The same evaluation
method as above was used, and the P—Value of Fisher’s exact
test was 7.2e — 4, in line with results based on ChIPePET.

We also checked the differential expression of those genes with
predicted ER regulation. We searched public databases for ex-
periments where the activity of the TF ER was manipulated and
found three independent microarray experiments (Stein et al.,
2008; Kininis et al., 2007; Saleh et al., 2011). We performed dif-
ferential expression analysis and used a cutoff of P< 0.01 to
deﬁne differentially expressed genes. With the same methods as
above, we checked ratio differences between genes with and with-
out predicted ER regulation. The results are shown in Table 1.
Three independent microarray experiments all supported the hy-
pothesis that core genes with predicted ER regulation were more
likely to be differentially expressed in the experiments where

activity of ER was modiﬁed, which also supported transcrip-
tional regulation between ER and its predicted target genes.

With ChIP-seq/PET and microarray data, we have validated
performance of CSTP in recovering true ER regulation. To be
reliable, we further evaluated its performance with other TFs,
such as MYC, FOXCl, SOX3 and E2F6, which were all pre-
dicted to take regulatory roles in estrogen simulation process.
However, most of those TFs have not been studied with either
ChIP-seq/chip or microarray/RNA-seq experiments in the ap-
propriate cell lines. In a search of public databases, we only
found data for MYC and E2F6. The same analyses were per-
formed as for ER, and the results are shown in Table 2. Like for
ER, we found that target genes with predicted MYC regulation
were signiﬁcantly enriched with both true binding sites and dif-
ferentially expressed genes, which validated the performance of
CSTP. With E2F6, there was only one ChIPechip experiment
available, and we failed to ﬁnd signiﬁcant overlap with CSTP
prediction. Owing to the limited experiment number, it is hard to
conclude further. Overall, even with this exception, evaluation
results with independent high-throughput data significantly sup-
ported the claim that CSTP predictions reﬂected true transcrip-
tional regulation.

3.5 Validation of CSTP based on other biological
processes

Above, we have described how we validated the performance of
CSTP in recovering the transcriptional regulation in the estrogen
stimulation process. We further evaluated CSTP in other biolo-
gical processes. Searching through the public databases, two
microarray experiments were found that could help testing our
approach. One was carried out by Kazmin et a]. (2006), where
LNCaP cells were treated with androgen or control and gene
expression levels were measured with microarrays at two time
points; in this experiment, the activity of androgen receptor (AR)
was manipulated with androgen stimulation. Another one was
from Peltonen et a]. (2010), in which MCF7 cells were treated
with different compounds to activate p53 activity. For both ex-
periments, we deﬁned core genes by differential expression ana-
lysis to their expression data and predicted transcription
regulation with CSTP.

In the biological processes studied with the above two micro-
array experiments, AR and TP53 were known as the initial and

presumably most important regulators. Therefore, we used them
to assess the confidence of our prediction. The same evaluation
methods were used as for ER. The results are shown in Table 3.
For AR, we found one ChIPwhip experiment and three micro-
array datasets and significant overlaps were observed, which sup-
ported our hypothesis that core genes with predicted AR
regulation were more likely to have true AR binding sites or to
be differentially expressed after stimulation by AR (see Table 3).
Similar results could be observed for TP53. Two ChIP-seq/chip
datasets suggested that core genes with predicted p53 regulation
were enriched with true p53 binding sites. In one of the three
microarray experiments, we observed significant overlap to genes
with differential expression pattern. However, we did not observe
significant overlap in the remaining two microarray experiments.
One possible explanation was that p53 regulated other regulators
and the second-wave regulation concealed the signals of p53.
Overall, CSTP evaluation with independent biological processes
validated the performance of our methods.

3.6 CSTP with comparable performance with
PWM-based methods

The common computational methods to recover transcriptional
regulation are PWM-based methods with which promoters of
genes are searched for TF binding motifs by matching to anno-
tated PWMs. CSTP is different from standard PWM-based
methods, as that it does not insist on clear TF binding sites in
promoters of predicted target genes. Although we have con-
ﬁrmed that CSTP can recover true TFetarget relations, we are
still not clear whether it could achieve a comparable perform-
ance with standard PWM-based methods. Therefore, we per-
formed comparison in the three biological processes mentioned
above.

MATCH, an implementation of PWM-based methods from
TRANSFAC (Kel et al., 2003), is used to predict TF binding
sites in the promoter regions of core genes, which can be clus-
tered into two groups based on the presence of predicted TF
binding sites. As what we did above, Fisher’s exact test is used
to check their overlap with true TF binding sites. Because per-
formance of MATCH hinges on the selection of promoter ranges,

we first checked the performance of MATCH at different promoter
lengths. We deﬁne promoters at a range from x to +500bp
around transcription start sites, where x varies from —100 000
to —2000 bp. Figure 3a shows the P-values for their overlap to
the true ER binding sites at different x values. At x = 2000 bp, we
observed the most overlapping signiﬁcance. With the increasing
of promoter length from x: 2000 bp, the significance decreases,
which may result from increasing false-positive prediction. At the
promoter length from 10000 to 30000 bp, we also observed
peaks with weak signiﬁcance, which was in line with previous
reports about enriched ER binding sites at distal promoters (Lin
et al., 2007).

We compared the performances of MATCH and CSTP in the
estrogen stimulation process. The results are shown as a Venn
diagram in Figure 3b. We found that only part of the predictions
was shared by both CSTP and MATCH. However, neither of them
recovered all of the true ER binding sites. We used Fisher’s exact
test to evaluate their overlap ratio with ChIPePET results and
found that the significance of CSTP was P<4.47e — 6, which
was more significant than that of MATCH at P<7.69e — 3. The
same evaluation was performed for ER with ChIP-seq data from
the work of Kong et a]. (2011) as shown in Figure 3c. The sig-
niﬁcance of CSTP is at P< 7.21e — 6, which is better than that of
MATCH at P<8.92e — 4.

We also compared the performance of CSTP and MATCH on
data from the other biological processes used above. For the
androgen stimulation process, AR binding sites were predicted
based on data from Kazmin et a]. (2006) and the true AR bind-
ing sites were determined by a ChIPechip experiment (Wyce
et al., 2010). Figure 3d shows the results of our evaluation.
CSTP prediction overlaps with true AR binding sites with a sig-
niﬁcance of P<6.63e — 5, while the signiﬁcance for MATCH was
P<0.55. The same analysis was performed for p53 with data
from Peltonen et a]. (2010), whose true binding sites were deter-
mined with two ChIP-seq experiments (Botcheva et al., 2011;
Smeenk et al., 2011). More signiﬁcant overlap was observed
with CSTP predictions, which were supported by both ChIP-
seq results (see Fig. 3e and f).

To be confident, we also performed the same evaluation with
three other tools: TFBS (Lenhard and Wasserman, 2002), Trap
(Roider et al., 2007), FIMO (Grant et al., 2011), all of which are
implementations of PWM-based methods. Their evaluation re-
sults are similar to that of MATCH (see Supplementary Fig. S3). In
summary, these results indicate that CSTP can achieve compar-
able performance to standard PWM-based methods.

3.7 Condition-speciﬁc target prediction with CSTP

Prediction of CSTP is based on the expression patterns in the
biological processes under study. Thus, we expect the prediction
for the same TFs in different biological processes to be different,
i.e. CSTP prediction is expected to be condition-speciﬁc. To val-
idate this, we took ER as an example and investigated the pre-
diction in three independent biological processes.

First, we checked the overlap of ER target genes that were
predicted based on three sets of data from Lin et al. (2007),
Kazmin et a]. (2006) and Kininis et a]. (2007) respectively. As
shown in Figure 4a, we found only three genes were shared as
predicted targets of ER in all three biological processes. The

overlaps between each pair of biological processes are also
limited, <10%. This result suggests that CSTP can predict dif-
ferent target genes for the same TFs under different biological
conditions.

Then, we investigated whether those predictions reﬂect true
condition-speciﬁc regulation. If genes are regulated by ER,
their expression is supposed to be correlated (or inversely corre-
lated) to the expression of ER genes. Therefore, we used
Pearson’s correlation to evaluate the expression similarity be-
tween ESRl and its target genes. Predictions for three independ-
ent processes were all checked with the same expression data.
Figure 4b presents the smoothed histogram of correlation
values that were calculated with expression data from Chin-Yo
Lin et al.’s (2007) work. We observe that correlation peaks of
predicted target genes based on Chin-Yo Lin et al.’s (2007) data
were closer to +1 or —1 than predictions from the other two
biological processes, which indicated more signiﬁcant expression
similarity. The same evaluations were also performed with ex-
pression data of the other two processes. Similarly, the more
signiﬁcant expression similarity was observed with predictions
associated with the tested expression data (see Fig. 4c and d).
These results suggest that CSTP is capable of recovering condi-
tion-speciﬁc regulation in the studied biological processes.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we introduce a computational method for the
delineation of regulatory relationships between TFs and target
genes, in a manner that is speciﬁc for a biological process where
gene expression experiments are available. In the public data-
base, numerous expression data from either microarray or
RNA-seq experiments are being available for different condi-
tions, which provides data foundation for computational predic-
tion, which promises CSTP to be useful for both biologist and
bioinformaticians.

With CSTP, only the core genes are predicted for their tran-
scriptional regulators. Proper selection of core genes is essential
for accuracy of prediction. First, core genes should be regulated
at transcriptional level in the studied biological process. One
obvious feature of those genes is their differential expression in
microarray or RNA-seq experiments. Otherwise, the expression
vector of the core gene lacks the variance to describe the changes
under different conditions, which makes its co-expressed genes
less likely to be co—regulated. Such genes might, e.g. be house-
keeping genes that are stably expressed under different condi-
tions or in different tissues (Eisenberg and Levanon, 2003).
Second, a core gene should have enough co-expressed genes as

distributions of correlations among different prediction

its neighborhood. Our method recovers the regulators of each
core gene by recovering the regulators of its co-expressed gene
group. Those core genes with few co-expressed genes will be
removed for further analysis. Taking Chin-Yo Lin’s data, we
found 51 co-expressed gene groups without enough co-expressed
genes for overrepresentation analysis. These considerations led
us to deﬁne the core genes as differentially expressed genes be-
tween conditions. It would also be feasible to deﬁne core genes
for time-series gene expression experiments by selecting ones with
most expression variances among different time points.

CSTP does not require clear TF binding motifs in the pro-
moters of predicted target genes. This setting enables CSTP to
recover the transcriptional regulation with degenerate motifs or
distal binding. One example is ER binding. It is reported that
only 5% of its binding sites locate in proximal promoters (Lin
et al., 2007). Investigation to promoter will ignore those binding

sites in enhancers or distal regions. CSTP helps to improve the
recovery of those ER regulation. In estrogen simulation process,
70 genes with true ER binding sites were also predicted with ER
regulation, whereas 31% of them had no ER binding motif in
their promoters. However, non-insistence to TF also complicates
the removal of false-positive prediction. One possible problem is
indirect regulation. It is especially true in a regulation pathway
like A —>B —>C. If B and C are both core genes and they have
similar expression proﬁles, CSTP may predict both B and C to be
regulated by A. One possible example is MYC. In estrogen simu-
lation process, MYC is predicted to repress the expression of
ESRl genes process. This is also conﬁrmed with microarray
data (Musgrove et al., 2008). However, ChIP-seq/chip results
do not support the direct regulation (Hua et al., 2008; Raha
et al., 2010). Therefore, we guess that some other TF might
take a mediator role. With some luck, analysis of the network

can help in clarifying the situation: if an intermediate TF gets
identiﬁed by CSTP, then elimination of transitive edges can lead
to better predictions of direct targets.

CSTP aims at infusing condition-speciﬁc information into
target prediction. There is clearly a wide gap between our ability
to computationally predict TF targets and the target sets for a
TF that can be observed experimentally (Gerstein et al., 2012).
The CSTP predictions discussed in Section 3 tend to be equally
reasonable predictions as PWM-based predictions, even when
our method has no insistence on clear TF binding sites in the
promoters. Both sets of predictions have their validity, but the
two sets are still largely different. Likewise, the CSTP predictions
for different conditions are different, in line with biological ex-
pectation. In this work, we did not include ChIP-seq data into
the prediction algorithm because we needed the location data for
validation purposes. Given that from overrepresentation and
gene expression, we could achieve reasonably good results, we
would hope that future inclusion of TF location data will get us
closer to an understanding of which TF induces which expression
changes in a certain condition.

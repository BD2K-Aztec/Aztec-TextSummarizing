Abstract

Motivation: A large fraction of eukaryotic proteins contain unstructured tails 0r linkers. The pres—
ence of flexible regions allows these systems to experience a high level of mobility facilitating their
biological function. The complex nature of protein rotation in such flexible modular systems pre—
cludes a straightforward application of hydrodynamic methods to calculate their rotational m0—
tional properties. We describe the workflow of HYdrodynamic CoUpling of Domains (HYCUD), a
program for prediction of effective rotational correlation times in multidomain proteins. The usage
of HYCUDis demonstrated by its application to the ribosomal protein L7/L12. Rotational correlation
times predicted by HYCUD might be used to detect molecular switch events mediated by disorder——

ordertransitions in interdomain linkers.

1 Introduction

The function of biological macromolecules depends on their internal
mobility supported by the presence of intrinsically disordered re-
gions (Huang et (11., 2014;T01npa, 2012). Reorientational motion of
biomolecules can be followed through a variety of experimental
techniques (Loman et (11., 2010; Walker et (11., 2004). However, for
slowly tumbling systems, the use of these experimental techniques is
limited. On the other hand, theoretical prediction of rotational mo-
tional behavior through standard hydrodynamic methods (Aragon,
2011) is complicated in these systems by the presence of several po-
tentially coupled motions (Wong et (11., 2009). To overcome these
problems, modification of rigid-body hydrodynamics (Bae et (11.,
2009) as well as Brownian dynamics of coarse-grained models with

the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (Amoros et (11., 2013)
have been employed. Here, we describe the workflow of a recently
developed alternative approach (Rezaei—Ghaleh et (11., 2013) called
HYdrodynamic CoUpling of Domains (HYCUD) to predict the ro-
tational correlation time (TC) of protein domains within flexible
modular systems. The details of the HYCUD method, together with
its application to the flexible two-domain ribosomal protein L7/L12
and protein X of Sendai virus, are reported.

2 Methods

The only input required for HYCUD calculations is a structural en-
semble of the protein of interest. If high-resolution structures of the

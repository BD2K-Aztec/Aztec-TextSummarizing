Abstract

Summary: Data—dependent acquisition (DDA) is the most common method used to control the ac—
quisition process of shotgun proteomics experiments. While novel DDA approaches have been
proposed, their evaluation is made difficult by the need of programmatic control of a mass spec—
trometer. An alternative is in silico analysis, for which suitable software has been unavailable. To
meet this need, we have developed MSAcquisitionSimulator—a collection of C++ programs for
simulating ground truth LC—MS data and the subsequent application of custom DDA algorithms. It
provides an opportunity for researchers to test, refine and evaluate novel DDA algorithms prior to

implementation on a mass spectrometer.

Availability and implementation: The software is freely available from its Github repository http://
www.github.com/DennisGoldfarb/MSAcquisitionSimulator/ which contains further documentation

and usage instructions.

1 Introduction

Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used in proteomics to
identify and quantify proteins. Many of its applications share the
underlying goal of uncovering the full protein complement in a bio-
logical sample. However, for complex samples this is rarely achieved
partly because the number of ion populations exceeds that which
contemporary instruments can individually target for sequence ana-
lysis with a tandem mass spectrum scan (MS/MS) (Michalski et (11.,
2011). Acquisition algorithms are necessary to control the data ac-
quisition process and manage the limited scan speed.
Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) constitutes a major class of
data acquisition methods. DDA methods perform a precursor scan to
determine the mass-to-charge ratio (WI/Z) and abundance of ions
currently entering the mass spectrometer, followed by sequence

determining MS/MS scans on ions from a subset of detected peaks.
The standard DDA algorithm, TopN, selects ions for MS/MS scans
that contributed to peaks of greatest signal intensity from the latest
precursor scan. Several other approaches, as well as adjustments to
TopN, have been proposed in order to increase peptide and protein
identifications (Graumann et (11., 2012; Liu et (11., 2012; Rudomin
et (11., 2009; Scherl et (11., 2004; Zerck et (11., 2013). However, TopN
continues to be the dominant choice for acquisition control despite its
bias toward abundant proteins and relatively poor reproducibility.
Currently, evaluation of novel acquisition strategies requires ac-
cess to both a mass spectrometer and its application programming
interface (API). Unfortunately, few instrument vendors provide an
API, and therefore the pool of researchers with the necessary tools to
explore this field is extremely limited. An alternative is to evaluate

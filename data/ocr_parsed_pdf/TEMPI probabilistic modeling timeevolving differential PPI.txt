ABSTRACT

Motivation: Time-evolving differential protein—protein interaction (PPI)
networks are essential to understand serial activation of differentially
regulated (up- or downregulated) cellular processes (DRPs) and their
interplays over time. Despite developments in the network inference,
current methods are still limited in identifying temporal transition
of structures of PPI networks, DRPs associated with the structural
transition and the interplays among the DRPs over time.

Results: Here, we present a probabilistic model for estimating Time-
Evolving differential PPI networks with MultiPIe Information (T EMPI).
This model describes probabilistic relationships among network
structures, time-course gene expression data and Gene Ontology bio-
logical processes (GOBPs). By maximizing the likelihood of the prob-
abilistic model, TEMPI estimates jointly the time-evolving differential
PPI networks (T DNs) describing temporal transition of PPI network
structures together with serial activation of DRPs associated with tran-
siting networks. This joint estimation enables us to interpret the TDNs
in terms of temporal transition of the DRPs. To demonstrate the utility
of TEMPI, we applied it to two time-course datasets. TEMPI identified
the TDNs that correctly delineated temporal transition of DRPs and
time-dependent associations between the DRPs. These TDNs provide
hypotheses for mechanisms underlying serial activation of key DRPs
and their temporal associations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many cellular events involve serial activation of cellular pro-
cesses during which genes/proteins associated with the processes
are up- or downregulated. Differential proteiniprotein inter-
action (PPI) networks (DNs) have been used to delineate PPIs
(edges) among differentially regulated nodes (DRNs), such as
up- or downregulated genes or proteins. The DNs have been
considered more effective for understanding the differences be-
tween two conditions, compared with non-DNs (de la Fuente,
2010). However, the DNs delineate no temporal transition of the
DRNs and/or their edges to represent serial activation of cellular
processes over time. Thus, time-evolving differential PPI net-
works (TDNs) have been introduced to delineate (i) temporal
changes in abundances or activities of DRNs (node transition),

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

and/ or (ii) formation of new edges for the DRNs and disappear-
ance of existing edges over time (edge transition). The TDNs are
essential to understand serial activation of differentially regu-
lated cellular processes (DRPs) during a cellular event and
their underlying mechanisms.

Time-course gene expression analysis can provide temporal
changes in abundances of the DRNs (Hwang et al., 2009).
Several interaction assays, such as yeast two-hybrid (Ito et al.,
2001; Uetz et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2008) and mass spectrometry-
based tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation (Collins et al., 2007) can be
used to measure PPIs among the DRNs. However, it is still
challenging to experimentally identify temporal transition of
the edges among the DRNs because of the limited coverage of
the interactomes detected by these assays (von Mering et al.,
2002).

The limitation of the experimental methods prompted us to
develop a computational method to estimate TDNs. Many meth-
ods for estimation of dynamic gene regulatory networks have
been developed (Kim et al., 2014). However, estimation of tem-
poral transitions of differential PPI networks (i.e. TDNs) has
been rarely studied. A couple of methods have been developed
to identify differential PPI networks, which can be then used to
estimate TDNs. First, a simple method to infer DNs using time-
course gene expression data identiﬁes DRNs over time and con-
structs a template PPI network with the known PPIs among all
the DRNs (Hwang et al., 2009; Przytycka and Kim, 2010).
TDNs can be then constructed by selecting the interacting
DRNs with significant expression changes at each I from the
template PPI network. Second, principal network analysis
(PNA) identifies differential expression patterns over time and
then selects DRNs and their edges (known PPIs between the
DRNs) showing the differential expression patterns (Kim et al.,
2011). A principal subnetwork (PS) is then constructed using
both DRNs and edges selected for each differential expression
pattern. Finally, TDNs can be constructed by selecting the edges
in PSs for which the linked DRNs show signiﬁcant expression
changes at each I.

Functional interpretation of the inferred TDNs is important to
understand temporal transition of the DRPs. In most of the
network inference methods, it is commonly performed independ-
ently from network inference using post hoc analyses of Gene
Ontology biological processes (GOBPs) of the nodes in the
inferred networks (Kim et al., 2014). For example, the method
proposed by Park and Bader (2012) clusters the nodes in time-
evolving networks based on the similarity of temporal transitions
of their edges and then links these clusters to cellular functions

using GOBPs. However, none of the methods estimating DNs or
TDNs integrates functional information, such as GOBPs, during
the network inference such that the inferred TDNs can represent
directly temporal transition of differentially regulated GOBPs
and time-dependent interplays between the GOBPs, thereby
facilitating functional interpretation of the TDNs.

Here, we introduce a probabilistic model for estimating Time-
Evolving differential PPI networks with MultiPle Information
(TEMPI). Although many methods have used probabilistic mod-
eling for estimating network structures (Friedman et al., 2000;
Ong et al., 2002; Song et al., 2009), a unique aspect of our model
is that it models additionally probabilistic dependencies of
GOBPs with network structures and time-course global data.
By maximizing the likelihood function of the probabilistic
model, TEMPI jointly estimates the TDNs showing temporal
transitions of network structures with temporal activation of
the GOBPs and their temporal interplays. During the network
inference, TEMPI infers edges not included in the known PPIs,
whereas most of the previous methods (e. g. PNA) select a subset
of PPIs for estimation of TDNs from the known PPIs.

2 FRAMEWORK OF TEMPI

TEMPI uses the observed data (time-course gene expression data, known
PPIs and GOBPs) as the input variables, estimates the output variables
based on the probabilistic graphical model describing probabilistic depen-
dencies among the input and output variables, and then infers TDNs
using the estimated output variables. First, TEMPI uses the following
three observed variables as the inputs. As the ﬁrst input, TEMPI uses the
time-course gene expression logz-fold-changes (dynamic data) of n nodes
at T time points, with R biological replicates (an n x Tx R array E in
Supplementary Fig. Sl, bottom left). Estimation of the TDNs only using
E can be an underdetermined problem (De Smet and Marchal, 2010). To
reduce this issue, as the second input, TEMPI uses known PPI data
(an n x n adjacency matrix GI ; static data) of n nodes (Supplementary
Fig. Sl, top left). In TEMPI, the G1 are converted into positions of n
nodes in a p-dimensional latent space (a n x p positional matrixXI) using
multidimensional scaling (MDS; Supplementary Information 81.];
Higham et al., 2008; You et al., 2010). In this study, we used the 2D
latent space (Supplementary Information Sl.1). MDS locates the inter-
acting nodes closely in the latent space: for example, for nodes AiE in GI
(Supplementary Fig. Sl, top center), MDS located AiD closely, but E
distantly from AiD in a 2D latent space. To identify TDNs, TEMPI then
selects m DRNs from time-course gene expression data (Supplementary
Information SI .2). TEMPI uses the m x 17 XI for the selected DRNs as an
input. Finally, as the third input, TEMPI further uses the GOBP data (I
GOBP terms assigned to m DRNs; static data), a m x 1 binary node-
GOBP matrix T in which tik = 1 when node i has GOBP k (e.g. a T
for nodes AiF in Supplementary Fig. Sl, top right).

Second, TEMPI uses a probabilistic graphical model (Fig. 1) that de-
scribes probabilistic dependencies (see Section 2.1) among the input
observed variables (X0: {T , E,X’ }) and the following output hidden
variables for m DRNs at each t : (i) a m x p positional matrix X1 repre-
senting positions of n nodes in a p-dimensional space at t, (ii) an m x m
adjacency matrix G’ representing the presence of edges between m nodes
at t and (iii) a m x l node-GOBP matrix A’ representing differentially
regulated GOBPs at t, in which aﬁk = 1 when GOBP k is estimated to be
differentially regulated for node 1'; otherwise, aﬁk = 0. The output hidden
variables were then estimated through the optimization (see Section 2.2).
Third, using the estimated outputs (X h = {X', G’, A’}), the TDNs can be
constructed as described in Section 2.3 (‘Inferred TDNs’ of
Supplementary Fig. Sl, bottom right). The resulting TDNs have the

following characteristics: (i) a pair of interacting DRNs according to G]
are likely to be linked when they share expression changes and GOBPs
[e.g. the interacting AiB in GI (Supplementary Fig. Sl, top left), both of
which were upregulated (Supplementary Fig. Sl, bottom left) and share
GOBPs 3 and 6 (Supplementary Fig. Sl, top right), were linked in G’ at
t= 1 (Supplementary Fig. Sl, bottom right)]; (ii) the links between non-
interacting DRNs according to G] can be inferred when they share ex-
pression changes and GOBPs (e.g. non-interacting ED in GI, both of
which were upregulated and share GOBPs 3 and 4, were linked in G3 at
t=3); and (iii) the GOBPs assigned to the interacting DRNs in T are
likely to be differentially regulated (e.g. the interacting AiB at t= 1 have
GOBPs 3 and 6 in T, which are co-differentially regulated in the esti-
mated A1).

2.1 Probabilistic graphical model

The probabilistic graphical model (Fig. 1) was constructed to include the
following dependencies between the input observed X0 = {T , E, X] } and
the output hidden variables X h = {X1 , G’, A’}: (i) X' depends on the initial
positions of nodes (XI) and their positions at t— 1 (X14) to achieve
smooth transition of TDNs over time; (ii) G’, a geometric graph, depends
on the distances between the nodes in the latent space and thus on X';
(iii) E depends on the interactions (G’) between the nodes based on the
observation in real PPI networks that the nodes with similar expression
changes are likely to interact (Grigoriev, 2001; Supplementary Fig. 82A);
and (iv) A’ depends on G’ and the node-GOBP matrix T, based on the
observation in real PPI networks that the nodes with the same GOBPs
are likely to interact (Sharan et al., 2007; Supplementary Fig. S2B).

Based on these dependencies, the probabilistic model was deﬁned by
the following four submodels (see Supplementary Information 813 for
further details of the four submodels):

0 Transition model (P”‘””) for m nodes is deﬁned as a product of m
Gaussian distributions: PM” = P(X’|X’T1, XI) =  1./\/(x,’.|m,’., 2,)

1/a§)]l. x,’. and I are the positional vector for node i at t and the iden-
tity matrix, respectively. a, and a, control the penalties of displace-
ment of nodes from positions (X’Tl) at tel and initial positions
(XI), respectively.

tions for m(m — 1)/2 pairs of m nodes: Punk =P(G’|X’) = Hm!)

the mixtures of Gamma distributions for all pairs of m nodes with
two sets of parameters, (kc.l , 661) and (kg, 662):

(A’|T) :PGO=P(A’|G’, T)=P(A’|G’)P(A’|T). First, P(A’lT) is
deﬁned by the product of Bernoulli distributions for l GOBPs of
m nodes:

function frequency ifﬂk, T)=log (m / Z,— tik) that penalizes general
GOBPs. The normalization constant s was deﬁned as the maximum
value of ifﬂk, T). Second, P(A’lG’) was modeled as the mixture of
Gamma distributions for all pairs of m nodes using two sets of
parameters, (kmﬂol) and (km, 602):

where k and 6 are determined to produce a higher probability in the

ﬁrst Gamma function than in the second one for a large (If—Ta}.
Many previous methods have used probabilistic models for estimating
the network structures using E (Friedman et al., 2000; Ong et al., 2002;
Song et al., 2009). However, a unique aspect of our model is that it
includes the ontology model to integrate GOBP data (A’ and T) during

the probabilistic estimation of TDNs.

2.2 Optimization of the likelihood function

The joint probability of the graphical model at each t is deﬁned by
P(G’,E,T,A’,X’|X"1,X’)=P”“"‘YPL"”‘P”"1”PGO. The output hidden
variables (Xh={X',G’,A’}) are then estimated by maximizing the
log-likelihood function of the joint distribution, log P(G’,E, T,
A’,X’ |X"1,X1) using variational inference (Beal, 2003). Brieﬂy, for
each t, we ﬁrst calculated the lower bound of the marginal log-
likelihood function, log P(E, T |X"1,X1), which can be obtained by
integrating the joint probability with respect to Xh (Supplementary
Information SI .4): for distributions of X h, Q(X;,),

logP(T, E|X1‘1,X') 3 fQ(Xh)log(m+)W)dA/h. We then used a

variational approximation (Beal, 2003) to estimate the variational distri-
bution Q(X;,), assuming the independency among the variables:

900.) = Q(X')Q(G’)Q(A’) where 90”) = H?=1N(x;mi, oil), Q(G’) =

n?.iBer(giIei-)t and W) = H?.in2-iBer(a,:,-wh)- In these distribu-
tions, pi}, 0,], Sf]. and ,Bﬁk are the variational parameters (Supplementary
Information 81.5). Finally, we determined the variational parameters
1, $5.]. and ,Bﬁk) such that they maximize the lower bound of the marginal
likelihood function as described in Supplementary Information 815.

2.3 Construction of TDNs

Using these variational parameters   and [Sf—k), the output hidden
variables (X h = {X1 , G’, A’}) were ﬁnally estimated. At each t, ﬁrst, the
position (x1, column 1' of X’) of node i was determined as the expected
value of the posterior probability of xl’. given the observed variables,
P(xI’. |X,,). The variational distribution with the estimated variational par-
ameters approximates the posterior probability distribution of the hidden
variables given the values of the observed variables: P(Xtho) g Q(X;,).
With the independency among the hidden variables, P(xI’. |X,,) g Q(x,’.),
P(g,’.j=1|X,,) g Q(gf.j= 1) and P(al’d=1|X,,) g Q(a,’ﬂ.= 1). Thus, x,’. was
determined as pi}, the expected value of Q(x,’.). Second, nodes i and j
were determined to be linked (i.e. gfj of G’ = 1) when
P(giJ-=1|X,,) g Q(g,-j= 1) =§fj 30.5. Using the estimated X1 and G’,
TDNs can be constructed as geometric graphs at individual time points.

Finally, for functional interpretation of the inferred TDNs, GOBP k
was determined to be differentially regulated (positively or negatively
activated) at t for node i (al’ﬂ. of A’ = 1) when the log-likelihood ratio
of posterior and prior probabilities of al’d = 1, log [P(al’ﬂ. = 1|X0)/P(a,’d =
1)] g log[Q(a,’ﬂ.= 1)/P(a,’a. = 1)] = log ,Bl’d/ﬂtki), was significantly
(P<0.01) larger than zero. The P-value was computed using one-tailed
t-test (degree of freedom = the number of nodes with GOBP k). Using
the estimated A’, the activation degree of GOBP k at t was estimated as
the fraction of the nodes with activated GOBP k ((11,: 1) in the network
at t among all nodes with GOBP k (ha-=1): Z,— (al’ﬂ. t sign(e,’.))/ Zitki,
where sign(el’.) is the sign of Ere; and r is the index of biological repli-
cates. The sign was multiplied to distinguish positive and negative acti-
vation of GOBP k for node i at t. Furthermore, the interaction degree for
two activated GOBPs k and l at t was estimated as the fraction of the
inferred edges between the two sets of the nodes with activated GOBP k
((11,: 1) and activated GOBP l ((11,: 1), respectively, in the network at t
among all possible edges among the two sets of nodes with activated
GOBPs k and l:

 gja1,a;,dgn(dgn(e;) + Sign /  ah)  aft-ﬂ -

The sum of the signs of the linked nodes i and j was included such that the
edge with different signs of the linked nodes should have no contribution
to the interaction degree.

3 A SYNTHETIC TDN MODEL

To demonstrate the performance of TEMPI, we generated a
template PPI network and GOBPs to simulate characteristics
of real yeast PPI networks and then sampled the synthetic
TDN model from the template PPI network for which temporal
transitions of (i) network structures and (ii) differentially regu-
lated GOBPs associated with the TDN model are known. First,
to generate a template PPI network with the characteristics of
real yeast PPI networks, we used a geometric graph model with
gene duplication and mutation (GEO-GD expansion model;
Przulj et al., 2010; Supplementary Fig. S3A). See

Supplementary Information S2.1 for the detailed procedure. The
resulting template PPI network included 26454 edges for the
3258 nodes (Supplementary Fig. S4A). This network was also
used as the input PPI network (GI). Second, to generate GOBPs
with the characteristics of real yeast PPI networks, we assigned
306 GOBP labels (T) to the 3258 nodes in the template PPI
network using a modiﬁed version of network module (NeMo;
Rivera et al., 2010; Supplementary Fig. S3B). See Supplementary
Information S2.2 for the detailed procedure. Among the 306
GOBPs, we used 103 after removing 203 GOBPs assigned to
>100 0r <5 DRNs, which can be too general or non-meaningful,
respectively, for functional interpretation. Third, we then
sampled a TDN model from the template PPI network by select-
ing the nodes with (i) GOBPs 60, 67 and 218; (ii) GOBPs 178,
228 and 206; and (iii) GOBPs 94, 146 and 246 at individual time
points based on predefined fractions of the linked edges among
the selected nodes over time (Supplementary Figs S3C and S4B).
See Supplementary Information S2.3 for the detailed procedure.
Finally, we generated time-course gene expression log2-fold-
changes that reﬂect temporal transitions of the synthetic TDN
model using MetropoliseHastings algorithm (Hastings, 1970;
Supplementary Figs S3D and S4C). See Supplementary
Information S2.4 for the detailed procedure.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Application of TEMPI to the synthetic data

To evaluate performance of TEMPI, we applied it to the syn-
thetic input data (T, E, G’). As the input PPI data, we used the
PPIs in the template PPI network (GI; see Section 3). We first
applied MDS to G’ for the 3258 nodes to compute X1 in 2D
latent space. To identify TDNs, we then identiﬁed 616 DRNs
with false discovery rates (FDRs) <0.1 using a modified version

of repeated measure-analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) test
previously reported (ElBakry et al., 2012) and maximum log2-
fold-changes>0.58 (1.5-fold) at least at one time point
(Supplementary Information S12) and used the X1 for the 616
DRNs as an input data. For the synthetic GOBP data, we used
103 GOBPs (T) for the DRNs as described in Section 3. Finally,
we used the 616x 6x3 synthetic logZ-fold-changes for the DRNs
as the input expression data (E). After applying TEMPI to these
synthetic input data (X’, T, E) for the 616 DRNs, the output
variables (X’, G’, A’) were estimated by the optimization of the
likelihood function of the probabilistic graphical model (see
Section 2.2). Using the X’ and G’, TDNs (TEMPI- Gt) were
inferred at individual time points (see Section 2.3).

For functional interpretation of TEMPI-Gt, we first examined
temporal activation of the 103 GOBPs represented by TEMPI-Gt
(Fig. 2A) based on the activation degrees of the 103 GOBPs
computed using the estimated A’ (see Section 2.3). The activation
degrees revealed that three groups of GOBPs (Groups 1:3 in Fig.
2A, left panels), among the 103 GOBPs, were differentially regu-
lated early, mid and late over time, respectively. Notably,
Groups 1:3 included GOBPs 60, 178 and 94 (Group 1); 67,
228 and 146 (Group 2); and 218, 206 and 246 (Group 3), respect-
ively, consistent to the predeﬁned differential regulation of the
three sets of the GOBPs (Supplementary Information S2.3). For
example, the high activation degree of Group 1 at t = 1 indicates
that a large number of the nodes with Group 1 are linked at
t = 1. The decrease of the activation degree from t = 2 indicates
that decreasing numbers of the nodes with Group 1 are linked
from t = 2. Moreover, the descendants of the predefined GOBPs
in Groups 1:3, respectively, were partially differentially regu-
lated. This is expected because the nodes assigned with the des-
cendant GOBPs also have their parent GOBPs (Supplementary
Fig. S3). We then examined temporal associations among the

GOBPs in Groups 1:3 represented by TEMPI-Gt based on the
interaction degrees of the GOBPs computed using the estimated
A’ and G’ (Supplementary Fig. 2B; see Section 2.3). The inter-
action degrees revealed that (i) Group 1 and their descendants;
(ii) Group 2 and their descendants; and (iii) Group 3 and their
descendants showed early, mid and late associations among
them, respectively, consistent to the predefined differential regu-
lation of their parent GOBPs.

Finally, TEMPI-G (Fig. 2C) showed the transitions of nodes
and edges over time from the initial network (GI; Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Of note, because of the geometric representation of
the TDNs, the linked nodes at t in TEMPI-Gt were moved clo-
sely to each other. The TDNs (Fig. 2C) for GOBP60 (Group 1),
GOBP67 (Group 2) and GOBP218 (Group 3) correctly captured
early, middle and late transitions defined in their true TDNs
(Supplementary Fig. S4C).

4.2 Comparison of TEMPI with previous methods

To quantitatively assess the relative performance of TEMPI, we
applied the two methods, the simple method (Hwang et al., 2009)
and PNA (Kim et al., 2011) described in Section 1, to the syn-
thetic data and identified TDNs as follows. For the simple
method, as the input data, we used the synthetic E and G’ in
the template PPI network. We ﬁrst identified the DRNs as the
nodes with the maximum fold-changes >a cutoff of 2 or 1.5. For
the DRNs, we constructed a DN using the G’. We then estimated
the TDNs (Simple-Gt) by selecting the interacting DRNs with
fold-changes>the cutoff in the DN at each I or either of its
neighboring time points (tel or t-I- 1) to reﬂect signiﬁcant
smooth transitions and then by linking the selected interacting
DRNs (Supplementary Information S3.1). For the PNA appli-
cation, as the input data, we used the same synthetic E and GI.
PNA identified three activation patterns (H1-3 in Supplementary
Fig. S5A) and then generated the three PSs (PS1-3 in
Supplementary Fig. S5B) that describe interactions among the
DRNs showing the three activation patterns based on the input
PPIs. By selecting both DRNs and edges showing PS1-3 at each I
and then combining them, we identiﬁed TDNs (PNA-Gt) at t= 1
:6 (Supplementary Information S3.2).

We then evaluated the performance measures (precisions, re-
calls and F1 scores) by comparing the TDNs inferred by the
three methods with the true TDNs and compared the perform-
ance measures of TEMPI with those of these two methods.
Moreover, in many species, known PPIs (GI) are incomplete
(Beyer et al., 2007). Unlike TEMPI, both the simple method
and PNA predict no edges not included in GI. Their performance
can thus depend on completeness of GI. Thus, we further exam-
ined robustness in accuracy of the inferred TDNs against incom-
pleteness in G’ by inferring the TDNs using the three methods as
randomly removing 1&90% of the PPIs in the template PPI
network (GI). Furthermore, to understand how the capability
of TEMPI to predict edges not in G’ can contribute to the per-
formance, we also compared the performance of TEMPI after
removing the edge prediction capability by ﬁxing g5]. to 0 when
gjj=0 during the optimization of TEMPI. PNA resulted in the
highest precisions, but the lowest recalls, indicating that PNA-Gt
had less false positives (FPs), but more false negatives (FNs),
compared with TEMPI and the simple method (Fig. 3A and

90% removal of the input PPIs. The performance can vary depending on
which PPIs are removed. Thus, we performed 10 times of random sam-
plings. Data are represented as mean:l:SD from the samplings. (B—C)

and correlations between the interactivities in the inferred Gr 5 and the
true Gr (Right). See the legend for the lines used for the three methods

Supplementary Table S1). By contrast, the simple method had
lower precisions (more FPs), but high recalls (less FNs), com-
pared with TEMPI and PNA. Interestingly, precisions of the
three methods are robust to the amount of the removed PPIs,
indicating the robust sensitivity of the methods for identifying
the true links against the removal of PPIs. On the other hand,
recalls of the simple method, PNA and TEMPI with no edge
prediction capability linearly decreased with the increase of the
amount of the removed PPIs. However, importantly, recall of
TEMPI was robust up to 60% removal of the input PPIs. Based
on the overall performance measure, F1 score deﬁned as the
harmonic mean of precision and recall, PNA was the best or
comparable with TEMPI when the amount of the removed
PPIs is <30%. However, TEMPI outperformed the other meth-
ods when the amount of the removed PPIs is >30% and showed
the robust performance against the removal of the PPIs. Also,
TEMPI with no edge prediction capability achieved the similar
performance to PNA, and the robustness against the PPI re-
moval disappeared. These data indicate that the edge prediction
capability of TEMPI recovered the removed links in TEMPI-Gt.

In addition, it is important to assess whether the three methods
correctly estimate temporal transitions of topological properties

in the true TDNs. Thus, we next examined the performance of
the three methods in estimating transitions of the topological
properties. To this end, we ﬁrst selected TDNs reconstructed
by the three methods when percentage of removal in input
PPIs is 30% because they achieved similar F1-scores. Then, for
the nodes in the G’ estimated by each method, we computed (i)
degree and (ii) clustering coefﬁcient(CC) proﬁles over time.
Then, we calculated correlations of the degree and clustering
coefﬁcient profiles with those of the true TDNs (Fig. 3BrC).
The comparisons revealed that temporal transitions of the topo-
logical properties in TEMPI-Gt, compared with PNA-Gt and
Simple-Gt, agreed best with those in the true TDNs. Structural
changes in the G’ s should be linked to transitions of cellular
functions represented by the G’ s over time. Thus, we examined
how well structural changes in the G’ s estimated by the three
methods were linked to differential regulation of GOBPs 60, 67
and 218 represented in the true TDNs (Supplementary Fig. S6
for the other predefined six GOBPs). For TEMPI, as described
in Section 4.1, the activation degrees of GOBPs showed that
structural changes in the G’ s well-represented early, mid and
late differential regulation of the three GOBPs in the true
TDNs (Fig. 2A). As another subjective measure previously re-
ported (Song et al., 2009), we further deﬁned ‘interactivity’ for
each GOBP as the average number of the edges in G’ among the
nodes with the GOBP. For the GOBPs 60, 67 and 218, temporal
changes of the interactivities obtained from TEMPI-Gt achieved
the highest correlation with those of the true TDNs, compared
with PNA-Gt and Simple-Gt (Fig. 3D). All these data together
indicate that TEMPI-Gt represents effectively the temporal tran-
sitions in the true TDNs in the structural (Fig. 3A), topological
(Fig. 3B7C) and functional (Fig. 3D) aspects, compared with the
two previous methods.

4.3 Application of TEMPI to the cell cycle data

Cell cycle is a representative time-varying cellular process.
Although small-scale TDNs for several molecules involved in
cell cycle have been studied, large-scale TDNs for a comprehen-
sive set of molecules for cell cycle are still largely unknown. Thus,
we obtained time-course gene expression data (GSE8799) col-
lected during the cell cycle of wild-type yeasts (Orlando et al.,
2008). We first applied MDS to the high quality of known yeast
PPI data (GI; Supplementary Information S4.1) to calculate X1 in
a 2D latent space for 3258 nodes. We selected the 755 DRNs
with FDRs< 0.1 using the modiﬁed RM ANOVA test and max-
imum log2-fold-changes>0.58 (1.5-fold) at one time point at
least. To identify TDNs, we then obtained the following input
data for the 755 DRNs: (i) log2-fold-changes (E) at six time
points with two replicates, (ii) positions (X1) in a 2D space and
(iii) 664 GOBPs (T) assigned to the 755 nodes (Supplementary
Information S4.1).

TEMPI generated G1 to G6 over six time points (G0, G1, S,
G2, G2/M and M phases) during the cell cycle. To understand
functional transition represented by TEMPI-Gt, we ﬁrst exam-
ined activation degrees of the 664 GOBPs. Among them, we
focused on the 14 cell cycleerelated GOBPs with pulsed changes
of activation degrees, a characteristic of the cell cycle (Fig. 4A;
Supplementary Information S4.2). They can be categorized into
the following three groups: Group 1, early activated GOBPs with

the peaks at G0 to G1 phase (DNA-dependent DNA replication
initiation, DNA-dependent DNA replication, DNA strand
elongation involved in DNA replication, DNA integrity check-
point and telomere maintenance via telomerase); Group 2,
middle activated GOBPs with the peaks at S to G2 phase
(post-replication repair, sister chromatid cohesion, DNA packa-
ging, spindle organization, spindle checkpoint, regulation of
G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle and nuclear division); and
Group 3, late activated GOBPs with the peaks at G2/M to M
phase [cytokinetic cell separation (CCS) and organelle inherit-
ance]. The activation kinetics of these 14 GOBPs was largely
consistent with their known kinetics during the cell cycle
(Orlando et al., 2008; Simon et al., 2001; Spellman et al.,
1998). For example, the expression of genes involved in DNA
replication and repair reached peaks in G1 or S phases (Spellman
et al., 1998), consistent to the kinetics of the GOBPs of DNA
replication and post-replication repair in Figure 4A.

We then examined the interaction degrees of the GOBPs to
understand time-dependent associations among GOBPs repre-
sented by TEMPI-Gt. In this analysis, we focused on the follow-
ing five GOBPs: GOBPs 1:2, DNA-dependent DNA replication
(DR) and DNA integrity checkpoint (DIC) in Group 1; GOBPs
3:4, spindle checkpoint (SC) and regulation of G2/M transition
of mitotic cell cycle (G2M) in Group 2; and GOBPs 5, CCS in
Group 3. The interaction degrees revealed the following tem-
poral interplays between the ﬁve GOBPs (Fig. 4B): (i) DIC
and DR in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, during G0, G1 and S
phases (t= 1:3); (ii) DIC and SC, as well as DIC and G2M, in
Group 1 at S phase (t = 3); (iii) SC and G2M in Group 1 at S and
G2 phases (t=34l); and (iv) SC and CCS in Group 4 at G2
phase (t=4). Some of these interplays have been previously re-
ported. Noh et a]. (2009) reported that downregulation of G2/M
transition-related genes (e.g. PLK1 and SURVIVIN) led to a
defect in mitotic spindle, and Gardner et a]. (1999) reported
that two DIC-related genes, RAD53 and DUN1, are required
for establishment and maintenance of G2/M arrest. TEMPI-Gt
showed temporal transition of the nodes with the ﬁve GOBPs
and their edges (G2M and CCS in ﬁrst row of Fig. 4C, SC and
G2M in second row of Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S7 for
individual GOBPs), consistent to the transitions of the GOBPs in
Figure 4A and B.

These ﬁndings can provide novel insights into the interplays
among the GOBPs during the cell cycle. TEMPI-Gt at S phase
(t = 3) showed the strongest associations among the GOBPs. To
investigate novel insights represented by the associations, we
built a subnetwork (Fig. 4D) including the nodes with the four
GOBPs (DIC, DR, SC and G2M) strongly interacting at S phase
(t=3). To reduce the complexity, we focused on the RAD53
subnetwork (Fig. 4D) including RAD53, a key molecule in
DIC and DR, and its 36 interactors involved in the four
GOBPs. Of the 36 interactors, only three are included in the
input PPIs (GI), while the others are predicted. To assess the
reliability of the predicted interactors of RAD53, we obtained
9850 interactions among the 755 DRNs from an independent
PPI database, BioGrid (Stark et al., 2006), and conﬁrmed that
18 of the 33 predicted interactors were previously detected by
high-throughput interactome analyses, supporting the validity of
TEMPI in the edge prediction. For example, TEMPI estimated
the interactions of RAD53 with the 23 nodes (‘x’ nodes in

Fig. 4D) involved in DR. Among them, RAD53-DBF4 and
DUN1 was included in GI, while the other interactions are
newly predicted. Of the 21 predicted interactors, 14 (e.g. CTF4,
CDC45 and CDC7) are reported to interact with RAD53 ac-
cording to BioGrid. Moreover, TEMPI newly predicted the
seven interactors of RAD53 involved in G2M (‘*’ nodes in
Fig. 4D), where three of them (CLB2, CLB5 and IPL1) are re-
ported to interact with RAD53 according to BioGrid. Similarly,
TEMPI identiﬁed seven interactors of RAD53 involved in DIC
(‘5’ nodes in Fig. 4D). Two of them (DUN1 and RAD9) were
included in GI, and the other ﬁve were reported to interact with
RAD53 according to BioGrid. The molecules with newly pre-
dicted interactions in the RAD53 subnetwork are known to be
involved in DIC, DR, SC or G2M, independently of RAD53-
dependent regulation of the cell cycle at S phase. Thus, all these
data indicate novel insights into potential roles of these molecules
in the RAD53-dependent regulation of the cell cycle at S phase.
Many subnetworks can be analyzed in the same way to generate
hypotheses for novel mechanisms underlying dynamic regulation
of cell cycle.

We further compared the performance of TEMPI on the cell
cycle data with that of PNA. PNA produced the 10 PSs. By
combining them, we generated TDNs as described above
(PNA-Gs in Supplementary Fig. S8). PNA-Gs were signiﬁcantly
sparse, compared with TEMPI-Gs (Supplementary Fig. S8), be-
cause PNA used only the sparse real PPIs (1425 PPIs between
755 nodes) in GI, whereas TEMPI predicted a signiﬁcant number
of novel edges among the DRNs (Supplementary Fig. S9A). As
described above, we assessed the reliability of the predicted PPIs

by examining how many of them are reported in the BioGrid
database (Supplementary Fig. S9B£). The fraction of the pre-
dicted PPIs reported in BioGrid (0.254) was signiﬁcantly larger
than the random expectation (0.0346). Moreover, TEMPI-Gt
captured the larger number of cell cycleerelated GOBPs
(120 GOBPs) with pulsed activation patterns than PNA-Gt
(16 GOBPs), suggesting that TEMPI-Gt more effectively cap-
tured cell cycleerelated functional transition than PNA-Gt
(Supplementary Fig. S91}F). The comparison of the distribu-
tion of degrees and CC also showed that TEMPI-Gt is
more dense and modular than PNA-Gt (Supplementary
Fig. S9G7H). See Supplementary Information S4.3 for further
details. Also, we applied TEMPI to the gene expression data
collected from the mutant yeasts with defects in cell cycle, com-
pared activation/interaction degrees of cell cycleerelated GOBPs
between wild-type and mutant yeasts, and examined deregulation
of wild-type TEMPI-Gt in mutant yeasts (Supplementary
Information S44).

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we developed TEMPI that effectively estimates
TDNs associated with activated GOBPs over time by integrating
time-course gene expression, PPI and GOBP data. TEMPI pro-
vides activation and interaction degrees of GOBPs, facilitating
the interpretation of temporal activations and interplays of
GOBPs represented by the estimated TDNs. This interpretation
leads to generation of TDN-driven hypotheses for key pathways
regulating cellular events under investigation (see Section 4.3).

Thus, TEMPI can serve as a useful tool that provides hypotheses
for the mechanisms underlying functional transitions in various
problems in time-varying biological systems. See Supplementary
Information S5 and S6 for implementation and limitations of
TEMPI, respectively, which include potential limited applicabil-
ity of TEMPI to other types of interactions than PPIs, sensitivity
to completeness of the input PPIs and the scalability issue.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Structural characterization of protein interactions is ne-
cessary for understanding and modulating biological processes. On
one hand, X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy provide atomic
resolution structures but the data collection process is typically long
and the success rate is low. On the other hand, computational meth-
ods for modeling assembly structures from individual components fre-
quently suffer from high false-positive rate, rarely resulting in a unique
solution.

Results: Here, we present a combined approach that computationally
integrates data from a variety of fast and accessible experimental
techniques for rapid and accurate structure determination of pro-
tein—protein complexes. The integrative method uses atomistic
models of two interacting proteins and one or more datasets from
five accessible experimental techniques: a small-angle X-ray scatter-
ing (SAXS) profile, 2D class average images from negative-stain elec-
tron microscopy micrographs (EM), a 3D density map from
single-particle negative-stain EM, residue type content of the pro-
tein—protein interface from NMR spectroscopy and chemical
cross-linking detected by mass spectrometry. The method is tested
on a docking benchmark consisting of 176 known complex structures
and simulated experimental data. The near-native model is the top
scoring one for up to 61% of benchmark cases depending on the
included experimental datasets; in comparison to 10% for standard
computational docking. We also collected SAXS, 2D class average
images and 3D density map from negative-stain EM to model
the PCSK9 antigen—J16 Fab antibody complex, followed by valid-
ation of the model by a subsequently available X-ray crystallographic
structure.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biologists are identifying components of macromolecular assem-
blies and networks (Krogan et al., 2006). To understand how
these assemblies and networks underpin essential biological pro-
cesses and to modulate them for therapeutic purposes, we need
to describe the structures of both natural and engineered protein
interactions (Robinson et al., 2007). Owing to the difﬁculty of
determining the atomic structures of protein complexes by X-ray
crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as well as inaccuracy of
alternative methods, such as proteiniprotein docking, new tech-
niques are necessary (Alber et al., 2008).

One major computational approach to predicting structures of
protein complexes relies on molecular docking of unbound
single-component structures. Even for complexes with two pro-
teins, docking problem remains challenging despite recent ad-
vances (Lensink and Wodak, 2010b). The major bottlenecks
include dealing with protein ﬂexibility and the absence of an
accurate scoring function (Ritchie, 2008). Pairwise protein dock-
ing methods can be divided into three classes based on their
configurational sampling algorithm (Vajda and Kozakov,
2009): (i) global methods using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)
(Eisenstein and Katchalski-Katzir, 2004) or geometric matching
(Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005); (ii) medium-range methods
such as Monte Carlo sampling (Fernandez-Recio et al., 2003;
Gray et al., 2003); and (iii) methods guided by data, such as
complex reﬁnement based on NMR restraints, cross-linking,
interface prediction or site-directed mutagenesis (Dominguez
et al., 2003; Sivasubramanian et al., 2006). It is common
to begin docking two proteins with an unbiased global search
followed by reﬁnement of the best scoring models (Mashiach
et al., 2010b).

Structure determination of protein-protein complexes

 

Characterizing the structures of multi—subunit complexes bene-
ﬁts from using varied experimental datasets (Alber et al.,
2007a,b; Russel et al., 2012). In this hybrid or integrative ap-
proach, the datasets are encoded into a scoring function used
to evaluate candidate models generated by a sampling method.
Integrative structure determination typically iterates through the
following stages: (i) gathering information, (ii) designing model
representation and evaluation, (iii) sampling good models, and
(iv) analyzing models and information.

Here, we present an integrative approach to pairwise protein
docking. First, data from one or more of ﬁve different experi-
ment types are translated into the corresponding scoring function
terms. These data include (i) the pair-distance distribution func-
tion of the complex from a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
proﬁle, (ii) 2D class average images of the complex from nega-
tive-stain electron microscopy micrographs (EM2D), (iii) a 3D
density map of the complex from single-particle negative-stain
electron microscopy micrographs (EM3D), (iv) residue type con-
tent at the protein interface from NMR spectroscopy
(NMR-RTC) (Reese and Dotsch, 2003), and (V) chemical
cross-linking detected by mass spectrometry (CXMS). These
ﬁve experimental methods were selected because of their feasibil-
ity and efficiency of data collection: a SAXS profile of the com-
plex in solution can be collected in several minutes (Hura et al.,
2009); a 3D EM density map can be reconstructed from a smaller
sample amount than that for SAXS, but data collection process
is signiﬁcantly longer (Stahlberg and Walz, 2008); 2D class aver-
ages can be computed from micrographs more easily and rapidly
than performing a full 3D reconstruction; the composition of
interface residues from NMR (Reese and Dotsch, 2003) provides
information about the interaction interface, unlike the SAXS and
EM data; and cross-linking data (Rappsilber, 2011) provide in-
formation at intermediate resolution imposing an upper distance
bound on inter-molecular pairs of residues. Second, complex
models are sampled, relying on efﬁcient global search methods
developed for pairwise protein docking, followed by ﬁltering
based on ﬁt to the experimental data, conformational reﬁnement
and composite scoring. Third, good-scoring representatives of
clusters of models are picked as ﬁnal models.

To validate this approach, we apply the integrative method in
two contexts. First, we test the method on a large benchmark for
protein docking (Hwang et al., 2010) with simulated experimental
data and known complex structures. This test allows a robust as-
sessment of the value of the individual types of experimental data
for speciﬁc types of proteins. Second, we also collected SAXS,
EM2D and EM3D data to model the PCSK9 antigeneJ 16 Fab
antibody complex, followed by validation of the model by a sub-
sequently available X-ray crystallographic structure. This second
test highlights the advantages of the integrative method that
allows computing an accurate model in a timely manner.

2 METHODS

2.1 Integrative docking method summary

Given the atomic structures of two proteins and one or more datasets
from SAXS, EM2D, EM3D, NMR-RTC and CXMS, we compute the
3D structure of their complex. The approach involves four major stages
(Fig. 1, Supplementary Material):

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the integrative docking method. The
number of possible conﬁgurations for two docked proteins is on the order
of ~10“ (three rotational degrees of freedom sampled in ﬁve degrees
interval and three translational degrees of freedom sampled at 1A
interval). As the method proceeds, the number of considered conﬁgur-
ations decreases

h

2.1.] Stage 1: Global search A global search in the space of all
possible docking models is performed using geometry-based molecular
docking (Duhovny et al., 2002). The conﬁgurational sampling precision is
increased signiﬁcantly compared with the default settings (Supplementary
Table S1: from 4.5103 to 212103 models) to ensure the interface and
global shape of the complex are sampled with precision commensurate
with that of the data.

2.1.2 Stage 2: Data-guided ﬁltering Each available experimental
dataset is used independently for scoring and ﬁltering of models incon-
sistent with the data. To account for noise in the data, we convert the
data into soft restraints. For SAXS proﬁle, a model is ﬁltered out if its
radius of gyration is in signiﬁcant disagreement with the experimentally
derived one (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2011). For EM2D class aver-
ages, there is no ﬁlter. For EM3D density map, a model is filtered only if
it signiﬁcantly protrudes out of the density map. For NMR-RTC data, a
model is ﬁltered out if it does not satisfy at least half of the speciﬁed
residue type frequencies. For the cross-linking data, a model is ﬁltered if it
does not satisfy any of the cross-links. For each data type, the scores of
the remaining models are normalized, using the average and standard
deviation of their scores (S Dam). This normalization facilitates combining
and comparing of scores for different data types with different noise
levels. The models are clustered, and the cluster representative with the
best ﬁt to the data is selected. Top-scoring 5000 cluster representatives
are processed further. This number of models usually guarantees that
near-native models are not excluded even in the case of noisy data
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.1.3 Stage 3: Conformational reﬁnement The goal of this stage
is to compute an interface energy score. Because rigid docking models
may contain steric clashes, the side-chain conformations as well as
relative positions and orientations of the model components are reﬁned,
and an interface energy score (SEnergy) is computed (Andrusier et al.,
2007; Mashiach et al., 2010a).

2.1.4 Stage 4: Composite scoring The ﬁnal models are scored and
ranked by a composite score consisting of a normalized interface energy
term and the ﬁt to the data:

SComposite = SEnergy + E SData;

2.2 Benchmark using simulated experimental data

Pairwise protein docking benchmark 4.0 (Hwang et al., 2010) is used to
validate integrative docking method. This benchmark contains 176 com-
plexes and their corresponding unbound structures, classiﬁed into 121
low-difﬁculty or rigid-body cases, 30 medium-difﬁculty cases and 25
high-difﬁculty cases, based on the degree of conformational change at
the interface upon complex formation. For testing EM2D and EM3D,
only a subset of 27 complexes with >675 residues is used (EM bench-
mark). These complexes are divided into 16 rigid-body, 4
medium-difﬁculty and 7 difﬁcult cases. Each of the benchmark complexes
also had SAXS, EM2D, EM3D, NMR-RTC and CXMS data simulated
based on its native complex structure (Supplementary Material). We have
also tested the method on three experimental SAXS datasets from
pyDockSAXS benchmark (Niemann et al., 2008; Pinotsis et al., 2008;
Pons et al., 2010; Schubert et al., 2002). Integrative docking is performed
on each of these cases starting from the unbound structures and the
predicted complex models are compared with the native complex and
assessed for accuracy. Each model is assessed for accuracy by two meas-
urements: orientation and interface accuracy, similar to CAPRI (Lensink
et al., 2007; Lensink and Wodak, 2010a). Orientation accuracy (high,
medium, acceptable or incorrect) is based on RMSD criteria
(Supplementary Material), whereas interface accuracy is based on the
fraction of correctly predicted interface residues (Supplementary
Material). In line with previous docking papers, we deﬁne a near-native
model as a model of high, medium or acceptable accuracy. The success
rate is the percentage of benchmark cases with at least one near-native
model in the top N predictions (N is typically 10, referred to as top 10).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Docking benchmark results

3.1.] Docking accuracy increases signiﬁcantly for individual
datasets Integrative docking method shows 2-fold increase in
the top 10 success rate compared with standard docking
(PatchDock-FireDock protocol) for SAXS and NMR-RTC,
almost 3-fold increase for CXMS and 4-fold increase for
EM2D and EM3D (Table 1, Fig. 2A). The standard docking
protocol succeeds to tank a near-native model in the top 10
scoring models in 24% of benchmark cases. When SAXS data
is used, this number goes up to 51%. If we consider only ~65
rigid body cases with <3% missing residues (unbound structures
compared with complex), the success rate increases to 77%
(Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2011). For EM2D and EM3D,
the success rate is 82% and 79%, respectively. This success
rate quadruples when compared with standard docking, with

the 19% success rate for the 27 complexes in the EM benchmark.
For NMR-RTC, the success rate is 47%. With up to three
cross-links, the success rate is 65%. If we consider the top-scor-
ing model, there is a 2-fold increase in the success rate for SAXS
and NMR-RTC (22% and 18% versus 10%), almost 4-fold
increase for CXMS (36% versus 10%) and almost 5-fold increase
for EM2D and EM3D (33% versus 7%).

Although using any type of data signiﬁcantly improves the
results relative to standard docking, we are still far from the
upper limit on the success rate, given the initial sampling by
ﬁner docking (97% of the benchmark cases have a near-native
model sampled by a global search). When we allow for a near-
native model in the top 100 instead of top 10 models, the success
rate increases to 71—89%, depending on the data types. For the
failing benchmark cases, the near-native model is usually among
the top 1000 models.

Structure determination of protein-protein complexes

 

The success rate depends on the difﬁculty of the benchmark
cases, but there is a significant increase when compared with
standard docking, independent of the difﬁculty (Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3). The success rate also increases when only high
or medium accuracy models are considered as near-natives
(Supplementary Table S4).

3.1.2 Interface prediction accuracy We ﬁnd that the top-
scoring model has a correctly predicted interface (Fig. 2A,
Supplementary Material) in 5&68% of cases compared with
32% for standard docking. Although NMR-RTC performs
worse than other data types in orientation prediction, the success
rate in interface prediction is comparable with that for other data
types. Based on these benchmark results, the probability of a cor-
rectly predicted interface in the top-scoring model is 5&70%
(depending on data type used) versus 32% for standard docking,
and it increases to 84e9l% if top 10 models are considered.

3.1.3 Dependence of success rate on complex size For each of
the five data types, we test the dependence of the success rate on
the complex size. The 176 benchmark complexes were divided
into four groups according to complex size, with the fourth
group corresponding to the 27 complexes in the EM benchmark
(Fig. 2B). Varying data types are most informative and applic-
able for different complex sizes. In particular, the success rate of
standard docking decreases with the increase in complex size
from 34% for small complexes to 19% for the EM benchmark.
The reason is that the number of conﬁgurations and ﬂexibility
increase with protein size. The success rate for NMR-RTC drops
sharply for complexes with >300 residues (for complexes with
>675 residues, there is no signiﬁcant difference between standard
docking and docking with NMR-RTC). The reason is that the
number of potential interfaces (i.e. the size of the search space)
increases with protein size. In contrast, the success rate of SAXS
is not sensitive to complex size. Unsurprisingly, the success rate
for CXMS decreases slightly for the larger and more challenging
complexes.

3.1.4 Dependence of success rate on protein shapes Protein
complexes were classiﬁed into oblate, spherical and prolate
based on the eigenvalues of the gyration tensor (Pons et al.,
2010) (Fig. 2C). The success rate of standard docking is highest
for oblate proteins and lowest for prolate proteins. The reason is
that oblate proteins have larger interfaces and better shape com-
plementarity. The success rate of NMR-RTC, CXMS and SAXS
is not sensitive to protein shapes owing to a combination of data
and energy scores. The most signiﬁcant increase in the success
rate compared with standard docking is for prolate proteins:
3-fold increase for NMR-RTC, 5-fold increase for CXMS and
4-fold increase for SAXS. No analysis was performed for EM,
owing to a small size of the EM benchmark.

3.1.5 Combining diﬂ’erent experimental datasets increases
the success rate We tested pairwise combinations of the ﬁve
experimental data types. The top 10 success rate increases from
42782% for individual data types to 63782% for pairwise com-
binations (Table 2). More important is the increase in the top 1
success rate from 17736% to 2&52%. CXMS data complements
all other data types, with most signiﬁcant improvement for the
top-scoring model, where the success rate increases from 36% for

CXMS alone to 47752% for all four pairwise data type combin-
ations. The top 10 success rate for CXMS combined with SAXS
or NMR-RTC is 80% and 81%, respectively, and is comparable
with the success rate of EM data types. Another successful pair-
wise combination is SAX$NMR-RTC, improving the success
rate for the whole benchmark from 47751% for SAXS and
NMR-RTC separately to 68% when both data types are used.
No signiﬁcant improvement in the top 10 success rate is obtained
by combining EM (2D or 3D) with other data types, as their
independent success rate is already high (79782%). For the EM7
NMR-RTC combinations, there is even a slight decrease in the
success rate because the NMR-RTC data is not informative for
large protein complexes in the EM benchmark. When all five
data types are combined, the top 10 success rate is similar to
that for EM (83%), but more important is the increase in the
top 1 success rate to 61% from 33% for EM alone.

3.2 Application to an antibody—antigen complex

To test the applicability of the integrative method for determin-
ing pairwise protein complexes in a biopharmaceutical setting,
we applied it to an antibodyeantigen complex with experimen-
tally generated datasets. In a typical biopharmaceutical discovery
project, antibodies for a specific target can be generated by mice
immunization or by phage-display libraries. The next step is
selecting an optimal antibody out of several candidates for fur-
ther development into a drug. Knowledge of the epitope is an
important factor in antibody selection process. Therefore, a
method that can model antibodyeantigen complexes rapidly
and accurately would be extremely useful.

In our case, the antigen PCSK9 plays a major regulatory role
in cholesterol homeostasis and it is an important drug target
(Horton et al., 2007). PCSK9 binds to the EGF-A domain
of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and induces
LDLR degradation. Reduced LDLR levels result in decreased
metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which may lead to

hypercholesterolemia. The antibody J16 inhibits the action of
PCSK9 by preventing LDLR binding (Liang et al., 2012).
Recently, a crystal structure of PCSK9 in complex with J 16
Fab showed that J 16 is a competitive inhibitor of LDLR binding
(Liang et al., 2012).

3.2.1 Complex structure modeling The atomic structure of the
unbound PCSK9 has been available since the beginning of this
study (Protein Data Bank code 2P4E) (Cunningham et al., 2007).
For the J 16 Fab, 20 comparative models corresponding to two
different elbow angles (1360 and 168C) and 10 different CDR
loop conformations were selected based on the ﬁt to the J 16
Fab SAXS proﬁle (Supplementary Material). In addition, the
missing loops, N—termini, C-termini and His tags were added
for PCSK9 and the J 16 Fab with MODELLER-9v8, to better
model the SAXS data. The integrative docking protocol was
applied to PCSK9 and 20 J 16 Fab models; the ﬁnal clustering
considered all complex models simultaneously.

The structure of the complex was determined by X-ray crys-
tallography during the course of this project, but was made avail-
able to this study only after the model of the complex was
computed. Therefore, this application corresponds to a real-life
antibody discovery scenario, where the unbound structures of the
drug target and the antibody are known, but the structure of
the complex is not available.

3.2.2 Assessment against X-ray structure Because the accur-
acy of a docking prediction highly depends on the accuracy of
the input structures, we first assess the accuracy of our input
structures. The Ca-RMSD between the bound and unbound
PCSK9 structures is 1.4A and between the bound and modeled
J16 Fabs is 1.0 and 3.0A for elbow angles of 1360 and 1680,
respectively. Thus, there are no major PCSK9 conformational
changes on binding. The elbow angle of the J 16 Fab in the com-
plex X-ray structure is 1376". Therefore, the prediction of the
elbow angle based on the Fab SAXS profile was correct
(Supplementary Fig. S1). We have also tested the fit of the X-
ray structure of the complex against each data type
(Supplementary Fig. S2) and observed high-quality ﬁts for
SAXS (X of 2.24), EM2D (cross-correlation coefﬁcient of 0.87)
and EM3D (cross-correlation coefficient of 0.78).

Next, we analyze the accuracy of the best-scored models in
terms of orientation and interface accuracy for different datasets.
The best-scored models with acceptable accuracy were ranked
14, 2, 2 and 2 for SAXS, EM2D, EM3D and all three datasets
combined, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). The best-
scored models with a correct epitope were ranked 3, 2, 1
and 1, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). Docking results
are slightly better for models with the elbow angle of 1360 than
for 1680, with acceptable accuracy models ranked 5, 2, 1 and
2 for SAXS, EM2D, EM3D and all three data types combined,
respectively (Supplementary Table S5).

3.2.3 Data-guided filtering and funnel analysis Ideally, the
normalized ﬁtting scores would correlate strongly with the accur-
acy of the model over a broad range of accuracy (i.e. I-RMSD
0f 0-5A or L—RMSD of 0—15 A). We now examine whether or
not such a ‘funnel’ exists for each type of data (London and
Schueler-Furman, 2008) and how these funnels relate to speciﬁc
complex structures (Fig. 3A). The three experimental datasets

associated with complex structures related by the pseudosym—
metry of the antibody (i.e. light chain versus heavy chain) and
the triangular shape symmetry of PCSK9 (Fig. 3C).

The SAXS dataset produces four funnels. One of them in-
cludes the near-native models, although this funnel is the least
pronounced among the four funnels. The EM2D dataset pro-
duces three funnels with comparable scores. One of the funnels
is centered close to the native structure, demonstrating the
predictive power of EM2D. The EM3D dataset produces four
funnels similar to those from the SAXS dataset. In contrast to
SAXS, the funnel with near-native models has the best EM3D
scores, although this funnel is not centered on the native complex
structure (its center is ~11  RMSD away from the native struc-
ture). While the EM3D dataset is best in selecting the correct
funnel, the EM2D score is better in picking the highest accuracy
model once the correct funnel has been selected. The shift in the
near-native EM3D funnel relative to the near-native EM2D
funnel can be explained by a distortion of the 3D density map
that results from inaccuracies in the initial density map used for
the 3D reconstruction that was obtained from the 2D class
averages by the random conical tilt method.

4 DISCUSSION

We developed an integrative method for docking two protein
structures by combining protein docking techniques with data
from five experimental methods including SAXS, EM2D,
EM3D, NMR-RTC and CXMS. To assess the accuracy of the
integrative method, we used a benchmark of 176 complex struc-
tures with simulated experimental data. We also applied the

method to an antibodyeantigen complex, relying on experimen-
tal datasets collected speciﬁcally for this study.

Additional information, such as sequence conservation and
impact of site-directed mutagenesis on complex formation, has
been used previously to increase the accuracy of pairwise protein
docking (Lensink and Wodak, 2010b; Mashiach et al., 2010b).
Here, we analyze the improved docking success rates afforded by
data from ﬁve accessible experimental methods. Our integrative
framework can be modularly extended to support additional
types of experimental data, such as those from footprinting,
site-directed mutagenesis, FRET spectroscopy and atomic force
microscopy (Trinh et al., 2012). In addition to the data types
tested here, binding site residues and distance constraints, if
available, can be added directly to the PatchDock input. In prin-
ciple, experimental datasets can be used either to ﬁlter docking
models or directly to drive the sampling. We select the first ap-
proach, because it allows seamless integration of any combin-
ation of datasets and we can rely on efﬁcient global search
methods already developed for pairwise protein docking.
Moreover, driving the docking with global shape data, such as
SAXS and EM2D, is algorithmically challenging.

4.1 Experimental datasets and their impact on docking

The experimental methods were chosen for their utility in a
biotherapeutics discovery context where multiple artiﬁcial bind-
ing proteins (such as antibodies) are engineered to bind a speciﬁc
drug target and rapid tools for epitope prediction are required.
According to our large benchmark analysis, EM (2D and 3D)
are the most informative of all datasets (Table 1). However,
collecting experimental information to generate a 3D map is gen-
erally possible only for complexes larger than approximately
100 kDa and requires a relatively large amount of work. Here,
we show that 2D class averages, which can be obtained signiﬁ-
cantly faster and for a wider range of samples, can provide the
same information for pairwise docking as 3D density maps. In
contrast to EM, SAXS has the advantage of being able to collect
and analyze multiple samples in a few hours. As a result, puriﬁ-
cation, SAXS data collection and docking of multiple antibodies
binding the same target could be performed in a matter of days.
Automation of collecting EM data is more challenging than that
for SAXS, although recent advances in data acquisition and an
increase in computing power have allowed more streamlined
processes in single-particle EM (Lyumkis et al.; Wu et al.,
2012). While cross-linking with mass spectrometry is informative
on its own, it also complements all other data types. With recent
advances in data collection (Rappsilber, 2011), it is becoming a
method of choice for combination with shape informative meth-
ods, such as SAXS and EM.

While validation of integrative docking by a large benchmark
using simulated data has allowed a robust statistical analysis
(Fig. 2), data collection and application to a speciﬁc target
with real data has highlighted advantages and challenges of the
integrative docking approach. Unlike NMR-RTC, which de-
pends on protein expression in a cell-free expression system,
both SAXS and EM gave useful data for the PCSK97J 16 Fab
complex. In general, larger size and higher symmetry of a com-
plex simplify EM data acquisition and interpretation. The larger
mass of an IgG (150 kDa) compared with a Fab fragment

(50 kDa) would simplify the data acquisition and image process-
ing. However, the ﬂexibility of an IgG may result in a conforma-
tionally heterogenous complex sample, favoring the use of the
more rigid Fab fragment. Although the EM3D data was most
informative for identifying the near-native cluster of models and
predicting the epitope, more accurate structural models could
be selected by the EM2D score. Despite the relatively low infor-
mation content of the SAXS proﬁle, the SAXS score predicted
the same clusters as the EM-based scores. Additionally, the J 16
Fab SAXS proﬁle was useful in predicting the Fab structure and
its elbow angle.

4.2 Improvement compared with standard docking

Although integrative protocol succeeds in including a near-
native model among the top 10 models in 42782% of the cases
(Table 1), state-of—the-art docking methods succeed only in
3040% of the cases, depending on the benchmark and accuracy
criterion. ZDOCK-ZRANK ranks a model with I-RMSD<
4.0A among the top 10 models in 3540% of the rigid-body
cases of Benchmark 2.0 (Pierce and Weng, 2008). Recently
developed residue potential, SIPPER (Pons et al., 2011), succeeds
to rank a model with L-RMSD <10A in 28% of the 81
Benchmark 3.0 complexes, where at least one model with
L-RMSD< 10A was generated by FTDock. In a recent
CAPRI evaluation, an acceptable accuracy model was submitted
by at least one participating group for 11 out of 13 complexes
(Lensink and Wodak, 2010b). However, top 8 predictors could
only predict correctly 6 out of 13 complex structures. While pre-
dictors can use additional information manually, a fully auto-
mated method, ClusPro (Comeau et al., 2004), succeeded to
predict correctly ﬁve targets.

4.3 Comparison to other hybrid docking methods

Docking has been previously combined with additional data.
HADDOCK (Dominguez et al., 2003) beneﬁts from a consensus
interface predictor CPORT (de Vries and Bonvin, 2011), suc-
ceeding to rank an acceptable accuracy model among the top
10 models for ~19% of the Benchmark 2.0 complexes.
pyDockSAXS (Pons et al., 2010), which combines FTDock sam-
pling with the pyDock scoring function and a SAXS proﬁle,
succeeds to rank a model with L-RMSD <10A in 43% of the
Benchmark 2.0 complexes (i.e. for 70 of the 84 complexes with
similar molecular mass for bound and unbound structures).
In comparison, our approach applied to the same benchmark
with a SAXS proﬁle only, results in the signiﬁcantly increased
63% success rate. The increase in the success rate is because of
the increased precision of conﬁgurational sampling and higher
accuracy of interface energy score in FireDock (Supplementary
Tables S6 and S7). The integrative approach had a similar
performance for three experimental SAXS dataset from
pyDockSAXS benchmark (Niemann et al., 2008; Pinotsis
et al., 2008; Pons et al., 2010; Schubert et al., 2002)
(Supplementary Table S7).

4.4 Sampling versus scoring

The current work highlights the challenges in protein docking.
Sufﬁcient sampling is required in the global search stage to

maximize model accuracy, hit rate and the quality-of—fit to the
experimental data (Supplementary Tables S1 and S6). Our inte-
grative approach is designed to beneﬁt from the increasingly
focused molecular docking search space afforded by consider-
ation of experimental data. While an acceptable accuracy
model is contained among the ~200 000 models generated by a
global search for 97% of benchmark complexes, our integrative
protocol succeeds to rank such models among the top 10 scoring
models only in 42782% of the test cases, depending on the data
used (Tables 1 and 2); correct binding sites are identiﬁed among
the top 10 scoring models in 8491% of the cases (Fig. 2A). We
suggest that a combination of ﬁner sampling methods (including
ﬂexible docking) and improved scoring functions with
physico-chemical and/or statistical terms can be helpful for fur-
ther improving the success rate of pairwise protein docking.
Integrative docking, such as that described here, may provide
the best compromise between the relative expediency and
inaccuracy of standard docking on one hand and relative com-
plexity and accuracy of experimental structure determination
by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy on the other
hand.

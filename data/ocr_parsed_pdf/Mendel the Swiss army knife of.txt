option, uses matrix completion (Candes and Recht, 2009; Chi
et al., 2013), which is a data mining technique that yields good
imputation results with lower demands on memory and numer—
ical processing. For both of these new additions to Mendel, we
often achieve greater than 100—fold speedups over competing
programs.

All of Mendel’s options are documented in a readable, com—
prehensive manual (www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/Mendel_doc.
pdf). Each type of analysis is described in its own chapter and is
best understood by consulting the sample input and output ﬁles
accompanying that chapter. These examples illustrate virtually all
facets of Mendel. The sample ﬁles also help in mastering the
simple formats of the input data ﬁles and the keyword strategy
of the control ﬁle. Putting the commands for a Mendel run in a
control ﬁle rather than on the command line, eases editing and
retention of program directives. Rather than creating or editing
the control ﬁle directly, users can access Mendel through our
Windows or Web frontends, which list each command, many
with drop—down menus. The Windows frontend, Gregor, forms
part of the Mendel package. The Web frontend, described at
www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/MW, offers a rich environment
combining data management and statistical analysis.

In practice, the sample input ﬁles posted with the documenta—
tion serve as templates for users’ input files. Data compression
has proved critical in handling large SNP genotype files. Thus,
the user can elect to input data via either text ﬁles or compressed
ﬁles in PLINK format (Purcell et al., 2007). The Supplementary
File to this Note describes the steps and ﬁles of a typical Mendel
analysis. Each run of Mendel creates a summary and a detailed
output ﬁle. The former displays the bottom—line results that
most users will want to see ﬁrst. The latter provides the details
of ML estimation, and diagnostics such as summary statistics
and outlier warnings.

Mendel is speciﬁcally designed to easily interact with other
packages, including those for the visualization of analysis results.
For example, Mendel is the computational engine within Mendel
Enterprise, an enterprise—level clinical database and web applica—
tion for genetic studies (www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/ME).
With tools for collecting, cleaning, storing, mining, displaying
and sharing phenotypic and genetic data, Mendel Enterprise
is used in large collaborative studies across institutions. The
server—based Mendel Enterprise uses the Software—as—a—Service
construct and requires a contract.

We distribute the standalone Mendel statistical genetics soft—
ware free of charge. Mendel, its documentation, installers,
frontends and 75 sample analyses can be downloaded from our
Web site. Supported platforms include, Linux, MacOS and
Windows. During the 2012 calendar year, there were over 1300
unique downloads. We welcome users’ comments and suggestions.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We thank the participants from our week—long Mendel courses
and other users for their suggestions for improvements to the
software.

Funding: NIH grants MH059490, GM053275, GM103774 and
HG006139.

Conﬂict of interest: Although the statistical genetics package
Mendel is freely available for non—commercial use, the clinical
database Mendel Enterprise is provided via service contracts.

Abstract

Summary: The 1000 Genomes (1KG) Project provides a near—comprehensive resource on human
genetic variation in worldwide reference populations. 1KG variants can be accessed through a
browser and through the raw and annotated data that are regularly released on an ftp server. We
developed Ferret, a user—friendly Java tool, to easily extract genetic variation information from
these large and complex data files. From a locus, gene(s) or SNP(s) of interest, Ferret retrieves
genotype data for 1KG SNPs and indels, and computes allelic frequencies for 1KG populations and
optionally, for the Exome Sequencing Project populations. By converting the 1KG data into files
that can be imported into popular pre—existing tools (eg. PLINK and HaploView), Ferret offers a
straightforward way, even for non—bioinformatics specialists, to manipulate, explore and merge
1KG data with the user’s dataset, as well as visualize linkage disequilibrium pattern, infer haplo—
types and design tagSNPs.

The 1000 Genomes (1KG) Project is an international consortium to
establish a human genome map of genetic variations (SNPs, indels
and CNVs) with a minor allele frequency as low as 0.1—0.5% in the
coding regions and 1% in the rest of the genome in multiple refer—
ence populations (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et (11., 2012).
This publicly available, near—comprehensive catalogue of human
genome diversity contributes to improve the human reference se—
quence, and furthers understanding of the evolutionary history of
populations and of the genetic contribution to diseases and traits.
The 1KG variants can be directly queried through the 1KG browser,
however the process to access some information can become tedi—
ous, requiring a good knowledge of the website architecture and
many clicks. Raw and annotated data are regularly released on the
1KG ftp server, but manipulating these large data files requires

converter to transform SNP genotype data of a locus from the 1KG
.vcf files into files that can be loaded into the HaploView visualiza—
tion tool (Barrett et (11., 2005).

We developed Ferret as a user—friendly tool to easily extract
genotype data from 1KG SNPs and indels into files that can be im—
ported into popular pre—eXisting tools, while also computing allelic
frequencies. Ferret unique features are to: (i) handle SNP and indel
genotype data; (ii) extract data from a locus, gene(s) or SNP(s) of
interest; (iii) calculate SNP, indel and CNV allele frequencies in
1KG and Exome Sequencing Project (Exome Variant Server, NHLBI
GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA, http://evs.gs.
washington.edu/EVS/) (Dorschner et (11., 2013) populations; (iv) cre—
ate PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007) and HaploView output files; and
(v) provide a user—friendly tool for the non—bioinformatics

specialists. Ferret is therefore a straightforward program that per—
mits easy manipulation, exploration and visualization of 1KG geno—
type data with well—known pre—existing tools.

2 Implementation and Java interface

We developed a Java algorithm to extract 1KG SNP and indel geno—
type data and to compute SNP, indel and CNV allelic frequencies
from a user—friendly interface (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
The user has to specify the following inputs:

(1) Genetic region(s):

a. Locus deﬁned by chromosome number, start and stop positions.

b. Gene(s) name or ID (e.g. CCR5 or 1234 for the chemokine C—
C motif receptor 5 gene) can be entered manually in the search
box separated by a comma, or a ﬁle containing a list of genes
can be uploaded (.csv, .tab, .tsv and .txt ﬁle formats
accepted).

c. SNP(s) rs number (e.g. 562091107 for the CCR5 rs562091107
32—bp deletion) can be entered manually in the search box sepa—
rated by a comma, or a ﬁle containing a list of SNP rs numbers
can be uploaded (.csv, .tab, .tsv and .txt ﬁle formats accepted).
Optionally, the user can request to include surrounding variants
in a certain base—pair window range around the SNP(s) of
interest.

(2) 1KG population(s): it can be any combination of the 26 1KG
reference populations.

Optionally, the user can request to output the allele frequencies
in African and European American populations from the Exome
Sequencing Project (ESP). Finally, the user can pick the name and lo—
cation of the files that will be generated by Ferret.

If the genetic region input is not a locus, Ferret retrieves the
chromosome coordinates of the gene(s) or SNP(s) from NCBI (NCBI
Resource Coordinators, 2014) Entrez Gene E—utilities (Maglott
et 41]., 201 1) or dbSNP (Sherry et 41]., 2001), respectively.

From the chromosome coordinates, Ferret extracts the 1KG
genotype data using tabix (Li, 2011), parses the .vcf subset file to
create .map, .ped and .info files (for file format description, see
(Barrett et 41]., 2005; Purcell et 41]., 2007)), and computes allelic

frequencies in the selected 1KG and ESP populations, which are
recapitulated in the .frq file.

In compliance with the .map/.ped/.inf0 file formats, we exclude
multi—allelic variants and CNVs. In order to include small biallelic
indel variants, which are not supported either by these file formats,
we artificially transform them into AfT SNPs while coding the allele
correspondence in the variant ID so they can be handled by pre—
existing tools. Our variant ID reports the rs number when available
(e.g. rs199824195), and the chromosome position otherwise (e.g.
chr3_46414861). For small indels, the variant ID also reports the al—
leles (e.g. indel_rs136158_AT/A or indel_chr3_46415285_GC/G)
and Ferret converts the genotype outputs by coding as ‘A’ the first
allele and as ‘T’ the second allele (e.g. AT converted into A and A
into T for a AT/A indel, and GC converted into A and G into T for a
GC/G indel).

By default, Ferret extracts information from 1KG Phase 3 (ftp://
ftp.1000gen0mes.ebi.ac.uk/Vol03214/ftp/release/20130502/) using
the hg19/GRCh37 human genome coordinates. Alternatively, the
user can opt for the 1KG Phase 1 version or for the hg3 8/GRCh38
human genome version. Ferret can also output allelic frequencies
without returning the genotype data, and the user can set a fre—
quency threshold for variants to output. Finally, more advanced
users can export data into a .vcf file.

3 Performance and example of usage

We have tested Ferret on general examples and monitored runtime
and output file size (see Supplementary Information). Ferret takes
approximately 3—4 min to generate files for a 100 kb locus or for 10
SNPs, and 35min for a 1Mb locus or for 100 SNPs (Supplementary
Figs S2 and S3). Runtimes are much more variable for genes (be—
tween 16 and 55 min for 10 genes), as gene size and variant density
can be highly variable (Supplementary Table S1). The reference
population(s) size is the main factor impacting output file size
(Supplementary Fig. S4): for a 100 kb locus, 1 MB disc space would
be occupied for the CEU individuals (n : 99) while 28 MB would be
required for all 1KG populations (n:2504); for a 1Mb locus, 14
and 311 MB disc space would be necessary for CEU and all individ—
uals, respectively.

After retrieving the genotype information through Ferret, the
user can easily manipulate the .map/.ped data with a pre—existing
tool such as PLINK to be merged with the user’s dataset, to per—
form association or population analyses, to infer haplotypes and
impute missing genotypes, etc. The .ped/.info data can be im—
ported into a pre—existing visualization tool such as HaploView to
access linkage disequilibrium pattern and metrics, haplotype esti—
mation, tagSNP design for customized genotyping arrays, or any
other applications. The .vcf file can be merged with the user’s
dataset, or used to filter out specific variants using VCFtools
(Danecek et 41]., 2011), or to annotate variants (e.g. gene location,
functional prediction, GWAS catalog) using Annovar (Wang
et £11., 2010).

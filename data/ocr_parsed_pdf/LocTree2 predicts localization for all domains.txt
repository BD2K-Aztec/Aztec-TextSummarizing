ABSTRACT

Motivation: Subcellular localization is one aspect of protein function.
Despite advances in high-throughput imaging, localization maps
remain incomplete. Several methods accurately predict localization,
but many challenges remain to be tackled.

Results: In this study, we introduced a framework to predict
localization in life’s three domains, including globular and membrane
proteins (3 classes for archaea; 6 for bacteria and 18 for
eukaryota). The resulting method, LocTree2, works well even
for protein fragments. It uses a hierarchical system of support
vector machines that imitates the cascading mechanism of cellular
sorting. The method reaches high levels of sustained performance
(eukaryota: Q1 8:65%, bacteria: Q6:84%). LocTree2 also accurately
distinguishes membrane and non-membrane proteins. In our hands,
it compared favorably with top methods when tested on new data.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Localization related to function

Archaea, bacteria and eukaryota form the three domains of life
(Woese et (11., 1990). Archaea and bacteria are prokaryotes,
i.e. organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound
organelles. Prokaryotic cells surround a single compartment by
the plasma membrane (Gram-negative bacteria add an outer
membrane). Eukaryotic cells are organized into several membrane-
bound compartments. Subcellular localization is one aspect of
cellular function as exempliﬁed in the cellular component in the
gene ontology (GO, Ashbumer et (11., 2000). Proteins contributing
to the same physiological function often co-localize (Andrade
et (11., 1998; Jensen et (11., 2002; Rost et (11., 2003). Although
proteins can be functional in different compartments (e.g. impartins
that shuttle other proteins into the nucleus), most proteins of
known function complete their tasks as ‘natives’ of one particular
compartment. For instance, many nuclear proteins are imported
into the nucleus without being re-exported (Cokol et (11., 2000);
virulence-associated proteins are likely to be secreted in many
bacterial pathogens (Durand et (11., 2009). Increasing evidence
suggests that proteins form temporary complexes to act in

concert, resembling a macromolecular just-in-time production
facility (Farhah Assaad TUM-WZW, personal communication). The
knowledge of localization may, therefore, be important to understand
protein interactions and cellular mechanisms.

1.2 Better annotations of function by predicting
localization

The sequence-annotation gap refers to the gap between the
number of proteins with known sequences and with comprehensive
functional annotations. Next-generation sequencing explodes this
gap despite increasing high-throughput experiments. Reliable
automated predictions of protein function could counter this trend
(Al-Shahib et (11., 2007; Bairoch and preiler, 2000). Subcellular
localization is one objective and easily deﬁnable aspect of ﬁlnction;
many in silica prediction methods have been developed:

1. Sorting signals: Sorting signals (short motifs recognized
by shuttle proteins) provide ‘biologically meaningﬁll’
explanations for particular predictions. Most localization
signals remain experimentally elusive (Nair and Rost, 2005)
and many of the known signals have little coverage, i.e. allow
the identiﬁcation of very few proteins known to localize to that
compartment (Wrzeszczynski and Rost, 2004). In addition,
some proteins are sorted non-classically—not signal peptide
triggered (Bendtsen et (11., 2004).

2. Homology-based inference: The best localization predictions
use annotations from close homologs (Nair and Rost, 2002b).
This technique has limited reach because reliable inference
requires high sequence similarity. It also has accuracy
limitations: two 500-residue proteins may be sorted differently
due to a S-residue motif.

3. Text-based analyses: Text analysis-based methods infer
localization from experimental information contained in the
literature, such as PubMed abstracts (Brady and Shatkay,
2008) or from controlled vocabularies of curated databases,
such as SWISS-PROT keywords (Nair and Rost, 2002a). All
text-based methods are restricted in coverage as they rely on
existing annotations.

4. De nava: De nava methods predict localization without
requiring signiﬁcant sequence similarity to annotated proteins.
These methods are solely amino acid composition based
(Chou, 2001; Park and Kanehisa, 2003; Reinhard and
Hubbard, 1998).

5. Hybrid approaches combine several of these original four
concepts (Blum et (11., 2009; Briesemeister et (11., 2009;
Hoglund et (11., 2006; Horton et (11., 2007; Nair and Rost,
2005).

LocTree2 predicts localization for all domains of life

 

Here, we present a novel sequence-based method for predicting
the subcellular localization of all proteins in all domains of life.
Our method addresses several shortcomings of existing approaches.
(i) We provide a common framework for all domains of life
and this framework is more robust with respect to sequencing
mistakes than other methods. (ii) We increase the number of classes
covered by a single consistent framework: 3 localization classes for
archaea, 6 for bacteria and 18 for eukaryota. Predictions distinguish
between integral trans-membrane and water-soluble globular (non-
membrane) proteins. (iii) Similar to LocTree (Nair and Rost, 2005),
we implemented a decision tree-like architecture of localization
classes imitating the cellular protein sorting mechanisms. A tree-
like structure accommodates the similarity of sorting signals speciﬁc
to similar compartments (Alberts et (11., 2007; Rusch and Kendall,
1995). (iv) We provide scores for the reliability of a prediction;
these are crucial because they allow focusing on the most relevant
results. All the above advantages were achieved without sacriﬁcing
performance. In our hands, LocTree2 performed signiﬁcantly better
than other methods on nearly all data sets tested.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sets for development and evaluation

We extracted protein sequences with explicit annotations of subcellular
localization from SWISS-PROT release 2011_O4 (Bairoch and preiler,
2000). Excluded were annotations based on non-experimental ﬁndings
(‘potential’. ‘probable’ or ‘by similarity’). Also excluded were proteins
with multiple or ambiguous localization annotations (e.g. Gram-negative
proteins annotated with ‘cell membrane’ could be in the inner or outer
membrane). Proteins lacking the term ‘membrane’ were considered as ‘non-
membrane’. Transmembrane proteins, i.e. proteins spanning the membrane
at least once, were found using terms ‘single-pass’ or ‘multi-pass’. Through
the NCBI taxonomy (Benson et (11.. 2010), proteins were assigned to one
of the three domains (archaeal, bacterial or eukaryotic). Sequence bias was
reduced through UniqueProt (Mika and Rost. 2003), applied independently
for archaea, bacteria and eukaryota. This bias-reduction ascertained that no
pair of proteins in the ﬁnal set had BLAST2 (Altschul et (11.. 1990) E-
value (EVAL) <10—3 or HSSP-value (HVAL) > O (Rost. 1999; Sander
and Schneider. 1991). For alignments longer than 250 residues. HVAL < 0
implies that the maximal pairwise sequence identity was 20% (Rost. 1999).
Filtering by HVAL and EVAL ensured that homology-based inference would
be less accurate than our previous LocTree method (Nair and Rost. 2005).
Alignments of fewer than 35 residues were removed, which is roughly the
maximal length of known localization signals (Cokol et (11., 2000). The
ﬁnal sets contained 59 archaeal. 479 bacterial and 1682 eukaryotic proteins
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 Data sets for additional testing

After completing the development, we benchmarked our single best method
against publicly available state-of-the-art methods. This involved the
following independent test sets: (i) 28 bacterial and (ii) 52 eukaryotic proteins
added to SWISS-PROT between releases 2011_O4 and 2012_02; (iii) 43
Arabidapsis thaliana and (iv) 201 Homo sapiens proteins taken from LocDB
(Rastogi and Rost. 2011). Proteins with HVAL > 5 to any previously used
protein (including those discarded during the redundancy reduction) were
excluded. This threshold corresponds to 25% pairwise sequence identity over
250 residues aligned. UniqueProt was used to reduce redundancy between the
data sets and within each data set at HVAL > O and BLAST2 EVAL g 10—3
with the minimum alignment length of 35 residues. We never used any of the
remaining proteins (Supplementary Table S2) for any further improvement
of our method. With the exception of LocTree. which used homology-based

and text analysis-based predictions of SWISS-PROT proteins, and WOLF
PSORT. which extracted an additional set of Arabidapsis thaliana proteins
from Gene Ontology (Ashburner et (11.. 2000). the other methods tested here
did not use any of the proteins in these independent test sets, as they were
trained on data from SWISS-PROT releases before April 2011.

2.3 Additional data sets for comparison with LocTree

A question not addressed by the above data sets and comparisons is
as follows: to which extent did our method beneﬁt from the growth of
the databases since 2005? In a separate analysis. all proteins for which
localization had been annotated before 2005 served as training set and all
from the above cross-validation set without sequence similarity (HVAL > O
and EVAL <10—3) to this training set were used to compare LocTree2
and our previous method LocTree (Supplementary Table S3). No parameter
optimization was applied when re-training our new method.

2.4 Prediction method

Each domain of life was considered as a separate learning problem yielding
three different systems of decision trees (archaea: 3 classes, bacteria: 6 and
eukaryota: 18; Fig. 1). Each leaf (rectangles) represents one localization
class. and each internal node (circles) is a binary support vector machine
(SVM). Most methodological aspects of the new method combine existing
ideas. We brieﬂy describe the main aspects here and leave the precise. formal
deﬁnitions to the Supplementary Sections 173.

2.4.] Input For each protein. sequence proﬁles were created by BLAST-
ing (Altschul et (11.. 1997) queries against an 80% non-redundant database
combining SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL (Bairoch and preiler, 2000) and the
Protein Data Bank (Berman et (11.. 2000). Our method only used information
available through these proﬁles.

2.4.2 Proﬁle kernel Kernel methods (such as the SVM) differentiate
between the input and the feature space. Here. the input space was spanned
by all possible sequence-proﬁle tuples. The feature space was implicitly
given by the proﬁle kernel (Kuang et (11.. 2004) that maps such a tuple
to a vector indexed by all possible subsequences of length k from the
alphabet of amino acids. Each element represents one particular k-mer and
gives the number of identical k-mers with a score below a user-deﬁned
threshold (7. This score is calculated as the ungapped cumulative substitution
score in the corresponding sequence proﬁle. We can then deﬁne the proﬁle
kernel function as the dot product between the two k-mer vectors of the
two sequence-proﬁle tuples. Essentially. the method identiﬁes stretches of k
adjacent residues in the query that are most informative for the prediction of
localization and then matches these in query protein.

2.4.3 SVM training SVMS were trained using a pre-computed kernel
matrix of all training proteins. For the proﬁle kernel, the matrix can be
calculated very efﬁciently with the sufﬁx tree-based ‘kernel trick’ introduced
by the groups of Christina Leslie and Bill Noble (Leslie et (11.. 2004). We
found other string kernels (Leslie et (11.. 2004; Lodhi et (11.. 2002) either
slower in runtime or worse in performance (Supplementary Table S4). The
SVM was implemented by the WEKA (Holmes et (11.. 1994) sequential
minimal optimization (Platt. 1998). Platt Scaling (Platt. 1999) mapped the
raw SVM score of the predicted class into a reliability between 0.5 and 1.0.

2.4.4 Tree-like hierarchy of SVMs The tree model (Fig. 1) was built by
training binary SVM classiﬁers; each of those was trained on different sets
of proteins. To this end, we ﬁrst looked at one of the two child nodes of
an internal node (e.g. internal node: root and child node: non-cytoplasmic;
Fig. 1a) and collected all the training proteins of its leaf classes (e.g. EXT
and PM; Fig. 1a). They were assigned to class A. Then we did the same for
the second child node (e.g. CYT) and assigned its proteins to class B. Now,
we could train the SVM of the parent node with the proteins in classes A and
B. Repeating this for all internal nodes, we trained the entire tree model.

2.4.5 Reliability index The reliability of the predicted class (leaf node) for
a sequence-proﬁle tuple was compiled as the product over the reliabilities of
all parent nodes (as described in [Reinhardt and Hubbard, 1998]). We formed
the LocTree2 reliability index (RI) by multiplying an integer of this value by
100. As the prediction conﬁdence did not change for scores <20, the index
was re-normalized accordingly.

2.5 Cross-validation

For training and testing. stratiﬁed 5-fold cross-validation was performed with
each of the three sequence unique development data sets described before.
This required several additional cross-validation layers to optimize various
free SVM and multi-class learning parameters (Supplementary Section 1 for
details). Note that we never used any information of the test split during a
training phase. Entire rounds of cross-validation yielded comparisons to other
multi-class learners (e.g. ENDS [Frank and Kramer, 2004]). Additionally.
the inﬂuence of redundancy reduction was monitored; this suggested a
controlled addition of redundancy after an initial reduction to be favorable
(Supplementary Section 4).

2.6 Performance evaluation

Looking at predictions from the perspective of a single localization class L
suggests various performance measures: the accuracy is the ratio between
the number of correctly predicted proteins in localization L and all proteins
predicted to be in L. Coverage is the ratio ‘correctly predicted in L/all proteins
observed in L’. Both values are combined in the geometric average gAv.
The overall accuracy Q(n) as the number of correctly predicted proteins
across n classes divided by the number of observed proteins in these
classes provides the perspective across all classes. Standard error for all
measurements was estimated over 1000 bootstrap sets; i.e. randomly select
n proteins without replacement from the original data set (in our experience.
bootstrapping without replacement typically yields error estimates that
are more conservative/long lived than those with replacement). For each
bootstrapped set, the performance X, is estimated (e. g. accuracy). These 1000
estimates provided the standard deviation of X, with the typical standard

error = standard deviation divided by 1/(n— 1). where n is the number of
bootstrapped sets.

2.7 State-of-the-art prediction methods

We compared LocTree2 with the following publicly available state-of-the-art
methods using default parameters.

CELLO 2.5 (Yu et al.. 2006) is a system of SVMS that predicts
localization of bacterial proteins to 5 classes and eukaryotic proteins
to 12 classes. Predictions are based on sequence-derived features.

LocTree (Nair and Rost. 2005) predicts localization of non-membrane
proteins from prokaryotes (three classes) and eukaryotes (six classes
for plants and ﬁve for others) through the hierarchy of binary
SVMs. The method uses features representing the entire protein and
N-terminus speciﬁcs.

MultiLac2 (Blum et al.. 2009) uses SVMS that integrate sequence-
based features with phylogenetic proﬁles and GO terms. It predicts 9
localization classes for animals/fungi and 10 plant classes (adding in
chloroplast).

PalyPhabius (Kall et al.. 2005) uses a hidden Markov model (HMM)
for the prediction of transmembrane protein topology and signal
peptides. It incorporates homology information for the increased
prediction accuracy.

PS ORTb 3.0 (Yu et al.. 2010) predicts four classes for archaea/Gram-
positives and ﬁve for Gram-negatives. It combines several classiﬁers
by a Bayesian network to generate a ﬁnal prediction of localization.

Scampi (Bernsel et al.. 2008) predicts transmembrane protein
topology through an HMM. Predictions are based on the experimental
scale of position-speciﬁc amino acid contributions to the free energy
of membrane insertion coupled with the positive-inside rule.

WaLF PSORT (Horton et al.. 2007) is a k-nearest neighbor classiﬁer
that predicts 12 localization classes for eukaryotes from sequence-
based features. Similar to its predecessors (PSORT). it uses a tree

ring: composition in the corresponding data set and outer ring: composition in correct predictions). Exceptions were membrane bound classes in eukaryotes
for which the performance tended to be better than that for the corresponding non-membrane bound class (e.g. MIT = mitochondrial proteins versus MITM =
membrane-linked mitochondrial proteins). Localization classes as in Figure 1; performance measures: Acc. accuracy; Cov, coverage; gAv, geometric coverage

hierarchy resembling cellular sorting and a battery of established
prediction methods.

Unlike all others. PalyPhabius and Scampi do not aim at predicting
localization. Instead. they focus on the prediction of which residues are
inserted as transmembrane helices into the lipid bilayer. In the context
herein, those two methods are compared to demonstrate that LocTree2 could
even stand up to specialists that optimize the distinction of membrane and
non-membrane proteins in their own domain of specialization.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Three prediction trees for three domains of life

Our ﬁrst hierarchal method, LocTree (Nair and Rost, 2005), used a
concept initially introduced by the work on PSORT carried by Paul
Horton and initiated by Kenta Nakai and Minoru Kanehisa (Horton
et (11., 2007; Nakai and Horton, 1999; Nakai and Kanehisa, 1991).
For LocTree2, many alternative trees were tested. Trees mimicking
the cellular protein trafﬁcking using binary models at the internal
nodes (Fig. 1) were similar in performance but much faster than
other multi-class schemes, for example ENDs (Frank and Kramer,
2004) (Supplementary Table S5). Starting at the root classiﬁer (e.g.
non-membrane/trans-membrane; Fig. 1c), the decisions at each node
are followed until reaching a leaf (e.g. mitochondria membrane
[MITM]). This leaf corresponds to the predicted localization class
(development set in Supplementary Table S1).

3.2 Cross-validated Q18 = 65% for eukaryotes

The ﬁrst decision for eukaryotic proteins was: does it have an
integral transmembrane region or not (Fig. 1c). This decision
was correct for over 90% of all proteins (Supplementary Figure
S1b). Both membrane and non-membrane proteins were ﬁlrther
classiﬁed into ‘secreted’ and ‘not secreted’; this decision reached
Q4 = 83% accuracy (Q4 = four state accuracy, see Section 2
for deﬁnition of Qn; Supplementary Figure S1b). Descending

the tree toward the leaves that represent the ﬁnal predictions,
the distinction between intra-cellular and secretory pathway into
10 classes for non-membrane and 8 classes for transmembrane
proteins was less accurate (Q8 = 75%; Supplementary Figure S1b).
The class with most observations (extra-cellular: 35% of data)
was also predicted best (accuracy: 80%, coverage: 91%, Fig. 2b,
Supplementary Table S6) followed by nuclear proteins (accuracy:
67%, coverage: 72%). The overall accuracy for 18 classes Q18
reached 65% (18-state accuracy, Fig. 2b).

Overall, performance correlated with the amount of available
experimental information (Fig. 2b: inner and outer pies very similar),
with the important exception that membrane-bound proteins tended
to be predicted more accurately than their corresponding non-
membrane bound neighbors (e.g. mitochondria [MIT] versus MITM
in Fig. 2b).

3.3 Highest numerical performance for prokaryotes

LocTree2 performed very well in the cross-validation of archaea
(three classes) with overall levels of accuracy and coverage
numerically suggested to reach 100% (Supplementary Table S7).
These numbers most likely over-estimate performance due to the
limited data. For bacteria (six classes), the overall accuracy was
84% (Fig. 2a); the most accurate sub-classiﬁcation was the sorting
into plasma membrane (accuracy: 96%, Fig. 2a, Supplementary
Table S6) followed by cytosol (accuracy: 87%).

3.4 Performance best for more reliably predicted
proteins

One way to focus on more reliable predictions is to compile a
consensus for alternative methods. Often, method internal reliability
indices are far superior at spotting the best predictions than
combinations of different methods (Eyrich et (11., 2003). LocTree2
computed the reliability index (RI) as the joint probability over all
individual SVM scores (see Section 2, Fig. 3). For instance, the

Fig. 3. More reliable predictions better. The curves show the percentage
accuracy/coverage for LocTree2 predictions above a given threshold in
the reliability index (from O = unreliable to 100 2 most reliable). True
positives are the number of correct predictions with reliability indices above
the given threshold. false negatives are the number of correct predictions
with reliability indices below the threshold and false positives are the
number of wrong predictions with reliability indices above the threshold.
The curves were obtained on cross-validated test sets of bacterial (gray
line) and eukaryotic (black line) proteins. Half of all eukaryotic proteins
are predicted at RI>80; for these. Q18 is above 92% (black arrow). As
the number of localization classes is lower for bacteria, the corresponding
number in accuracy is higher (Q6 is above 95% at 50% coverage. gray arrow)

50% of the proteins with highest reliability reached levels of overall
accuracy Q6 = 98% for bacteria (Fig. 3, gray arrow) and Q18 = 92%
for eukaryota (Fig. 3, black arrow). To pick another point, almost
40% of all eukaryotic proteins were predicted at RI > 85; for these,
Q18 was above 95%. Thus, two in the top 40 predictions in 100 were
wrong in one of 18 states (e. g. nuclear instead of nuclear membrane).

3.5 LocTree2 competitive for new proteins

There is no value in comparing LocTree2 with other methods based
on values for performance published because of the differences
in, for example data sets and cross-validation setups. Comparisons
based on running other methods on our data are also problematic
due to possible overlap in training and due to possible performance
over-estimates of our own method. The only meaningful way is to
use proteins that are non-redundant with respect to each other and
with respect to any protein used for the development of the methods
tested. Toward this end, we collected the most recently added
annotations in SWISS-PROT. The price for this ‘clean’ comparison
was the tiny data set: 28 bacterial and 52 eukaryotic proteins after
redundancy reduction (explaining high stande errors in Table 1).

CELLO 2.5 and PSORTb 3.0 classiﬁed bacterial proteins into ﬁve
classes and LocTree into three. This was accounted for by grouping
bacterial extra-cellular and ﬁmbrium proteins into one common class
for predictions using these external methods. We separated Gram-
positive from Gram-negative bacterial proteins according to Yu et (11.
(2010) for a comparison with PSORTb 3.0.

Eukaryotic proteins were classiﬁed into twelve classes for CELLO
2.5 and WoLF PSORT, into ten classes for MultiLoc2 and into six

classes for LocTree. We excluded vacuolar proteins for MultiLoc2
and plasma membrane proteins for LocTree (thereby providing
over-optimistic upper performance levels for those methods). WoLF
PSORT may predict multiple localizations, and we always took the
right one for performance estimates (it was veriﬁed that this did
not impact estimates signiﬁcantly). WoLF PSORT and CELLO 2.5
distinguish cytoskeleton and cytoplasm; here, both were considered
as cytoplasmic. Another issue was that other methods do not
distinguish membrane from non-membrane proteins. Thus, we
merged these two classes, i.e. treated nuclear and nuclear-membrane
proteins identically, although this approach implicitly sacriﬁced one
of the important strengths of our new method, namely the distinction
of these.

The ‘New SWISS-PROT’ bacterial and eukaryotic sets were
too small to clearly identify the top performing method given
the standard error. However, LocTree2 compared favorably to
other state-of-the-art methods (Table 1). Performance estimates for
the newly annotated proteins tended to be lower than the values
published (except for LocTree and MultiLoc2). For LocTree2, the
overall accuracy was similar for the cross-validation experiment
(84% :l: 4% for bacteria and 65% :l: 3% for eukaryota; Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table S6) and for the new proteins (86% :l: 16%
for bacteria and 65% :l: 14% for eukaryota; Table 1).

3.6 LocTree2 would already have performed well in
2005

Another way to compare two prediction methods is to train and
test on the same data set. We trained a version of LocTree2 on
proteins for which localization was known when LocTree was
trained and tested both on proteins from our newer cross-validation
set without sequence similarity to the training set (see Section 2 and
Supplementary Table S3). LocTree2 outperformed LocTree reaching
levels of overall accuracy Q3 = 80% :l: 13% for bacteria and Q6 =
61% :l: 8% for eukaryota (LocTree: Q3 = 62% :l: 18% and Q6 = 54%
:l: 8%). Thus, the improvement of LocTree2 originated mainly from
the underlying method advancement. LocTree2 trained on the 2011
data reached Q6 = 62% :l: 8% and Q18 = 60% :l: 9% which is within
the stande error of what was obtained on the full cross-validation
set (Supplementary Table S6).

3.7 High-throughput data ambiguous?

LocDB collects localization annotations mostly from high-
throughput experiments; it provided two data sets for the comparison
of methods: one for the plantArabidapsis thaliana and the other for
Homo sapiens. Both sets were redundancy reduced, with respect
to each other and with respect to SWISS-PROT version 2011_04.
For all the LocDB proteins, all methods appeared to perform
substantially worse than for the already ‘tough’ set of newly
annotated SWISS-PROT proteins. For the plant, LocTree2 out-
performed others (Table 1). Not so for human: WoLF PSORT
reached Q8 = 45% :l: 8% (versus LocTree2 Q8 = 42% :l:
8%). One-third of the correct predictions from WoLF PSORT
were for cytoplasmic proteins, which was overall, the most
populated class for human proteins in LocDB (Supplementary
Table S2).

How to interpret the data from LocDB? As most annotations
in LocDB originate from high-throughput experiments, it is very

Data ‘New SWISS-PROT’: 28 sequence-unique bacterial and 52 eukaryotic proteins added to SWISS-PROT between releases 2011_04 and 2012_02 (sequence uniqueness was
ascertained both within this set and from any protein in this set to any other protein previously in SWISS-PROT). Data ‘A. thaliana‘and ‘H. sapiens’: 43 Arabidapsis thaliana and
201 Homo sapiens proteins from the LocDB database (as for ‘New SWISS-PROT’: sequence unique with respect to itself and to SWISS-PROT 2011_04). Qn, the overall prediction

likely that LocDB contains proportionally more errors than SWISS-
PROT. All methods by far outperformed random, implying that
for random annotation mistakes they would appear to be mostly
wrong. Thus, the higher error rate in LocDB might explain why
all methods perform worse for the LocDB than for the SWISS-
PROT data. Put differently, for a task with over six classes and the
given number of proteins, a few mistakes can reduce the average
considerably. On the other hand, we might also suspect that high-
throughput experiments discover a reality invisible to traditional
experimental methods and some of those invisible facts might
reveal new sorting mechanisms. Such hidden mechanisms might
or might not be ‘discovered’ by prediction methods. If not, those
would explain many incorrect predictions. Supposedly, most experts
would be very surprised if the second argument (new mechanism)
dominated over the ﬁrst (annotation mistakes of high-throughput
experiments). Most likely there is a little bit of both, but we have no
means of gauging the relative proportions. Zooming into annotations
with several evidences brought the numbers closer, i.e. ‘increased’
the performance, but this was achieved at raising the standard errors
to meaningless values (Supplementary Table S8).

We illustrate the situation for a few extreme predictions. (i)
‘Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 3’ (SWISS-
PROT TMED3_HUMAN) is annotated as Golgi apparatus by
LocDB; LocTree2 maps it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membrane with extremely high reliability (RI=99). This protein
belongs to a family of p24 membrane proteins localizing to the
ER and to the Golgi complex (Jenne et (11., 2002). Thus, both
LocTree2 and LocDB annotations are correct. (ii) ‘Protein canopy
homolog 2’ (CNPY2_HUMAN) is annotated as cytoplasmic in
LocDB; LocTree2 predicts ER (RI=73). We found experimental
evidence for localization to the ER in HeLa cells (Hirate and
Okamoto, 2006). In this case, LocTree2 is correct and LocDB
is not. (iii) ‘Methylosome subunit pICln’ (ICLN_HUMAN) is
classiﬁed as plasma membrane in LocDB, whereas LocTree2
predicts nuclear (RI=55). We could not ﬁnd any additional
information for this case in PubMed, but the protein localization
annotation in SWISS-PROT is nuclear. (iv) ‘COMM domain-
containing protein 1’ (COMD1_HUMAN) is classiﬁed as secreted in
LocDB, whereas LocTree2 predicts nuclear (RI=50). Again, closer

inspection revealed experimental evidence for this protein to be
nuclear (Burstein et (11., 2005).

It remained unclear what to conclude from the above examples.
The predictions judged as incorrect by LocDB but having very high
reliability scores indicate that the low performance inverts the real
picture: rather the annotations are wrong or ambiguous than the
strong predictions. For a set of weakest predictions, we observed the
opposite. For example (i) ‘Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum
protein 1’ (SERP1_HUMAN) is annotated as ER correctly in
LocDB, but LocTree2 maps it to mitochondria with very low
reliability (RI = 6). (ii) ‘Spermatogenesis-associated protein 19,
mitochondrial’ (SPT19_HUMAN) is classiﬁed as mitochondrial
correctly in LocDB again, whereas LocTree2 predicts nuclear (RI =
13). A more detailed analysis might succeed in quantifying to which
extent the consistent drop in performance for the LocDB data sets
reveals more about problems of high-throughput experiments than
of mega-throughput computations.

3.8 Accurate distinction between membrane and
non-membrane

As reported before, the SVM that distinguishes between non-/trans-
membrane proteins in eukaryotes achieved an overall accuracy
of 94% :l: 2% (Supplementary Figure S1b). This performance
was similar to what PolyPhobius achieved on the same data set
(95% :l: 1%). PolyPhobius appears to be the best expert method
that targets the prediction of integral membrane helices directly
(Kloppman E., Reeb J. and Rost B., unpublished data). LocTree2
correctly classiﬁed all plasma membrane proteins from archaea
(Supplementary Table S7), but the data set was too small to
provide meaningful performance estimates. For bacterial proteins,
the plasma membrane/non-membrane distinction reached 96% :l:
4% accuracy (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table S6). Scampi, the
most accurate method for predicting trans-membrane proteins in
prokaryotes (Kloppman E., Reeb J. and Rost B., unpublished) was
signiﬁcantly less accurate (89% :l: 3%) for the same data.

3.9 Advantage over existing methods for sequencing
errors

All prediction methods were also benchmarked on protein fragments
as they may result from erroneous assembly or wrong gene
predictions common in genome projects (Brent and Guigo,
2004). The latter being a special problem for the detection of
N-terminal signals because of the wrong predictions of gene
starts common when using gene prediction software. Three
different ‘models’ simulated worst-case scenarios (over-estimating
sequencing mistakes): cleaving off (i) 30 N-terminal residues for
all proteins, (ii) 30 C-terminal residues and (iii) randomly picking
positions to cleave one third of the sequence. The least ‘damage’ was
done for the C-term cleavage with LocTree2’s accuracy dropping
to 60% :l: 2% (Supplementary Table S9), which was still within the
stande error of what was obtained using the ﬁlll-length sequences.
For other prediction methods, performance dropped much more.
Our method also signiﬁcantly outperformed its competitors on the
N-term cleaved sequences and on the sequences with randomly
cleaved fragments, reaching the levels above 53% :l: 2% accuracy
(Supplementary Table S9). This is still accurate enough to provide
reliable ﬁrst estimates of localization for genomic sequences.

4 CONCLUSION

The method introduced here, LocTree2, predicts protein subcellular
localization through a consistent new framework that ignores
many of the relevant features needed for the success of previous
methods (such as no predicted aspects of protein structure and
ﬁlnction). Nevertheless, it seemed to reach high levels of sustained
performance aside from adding new aspects. Among the novel
aspects was the large number of 18 localization classes predicted for
eukaryota, 6 for bacteria and 3 for archaea. LocTree2 outperformed
other methods on almost all data sets tested, implicating an improved
ability to capture localization signals in the protein sequence. One
example for the success in plucking implicit information is the high
precision in the distinction between membrane and globular water-
soluble proteins. Our implicit distinction appeared as good as that
of the best expert method for predicting integral membrane helices.
Another important novelty is the robustness of the method against
sequencing errors and its success when applied to protein fragments.
This is particularly important in light of high-throughput sequencing,
of analyzing ancient DNA with short reads and of the fact that almost
80% of all proteins have multiple domains. This power along with
the overall improvement in performance may recommend this new
tool as an ideal starting point for comparing the proteomes between
organisms and for using localization predictions to aid the prediction
of protein function. We imagine that the framework for the method
will prove extendable and that ﬁlture methods will become better
simply by using more experimental data and more sequences.

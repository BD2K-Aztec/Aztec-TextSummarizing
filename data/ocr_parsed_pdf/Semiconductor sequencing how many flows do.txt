Abstract

Motivation: Semiconductor sequencing directly translates chemically encoded information (A, C,
G or T) into voltage signals that are detected by a semiconductor device. Changes of pH value and
thereby of the electric potential in the reaction well are detected during strand synthesis from
nucleotides provided in cyclic repeated flows for each type of nucleotide. To minimize time require—
ment and costs, it is necessary to know the number of flows that are required for complete cover—
age of the templates.

Results: We calculate the number of required flows in a random sequence model and present exact
expressions for cumulative distribution function, expected value and variance. Additionally, we
provide an algorithm to calculate the number of required flows for a concrete list of amplicons
using a BED file of genomic positions as input. We apply the algorithm to calculate the number of
flows that are required to cover six amplicon panels that are used fortargeted sequencing in cancer
research. The upper bounds obtained for the number of flows allow to enhance the instrument
throughput from two chips to three chips per day for four ofthese panels.

Availability and implementation: The algorithm for calculation of the flows was implemented in R
and is available as package ionflows from the CRAN repository.

1 Introduction

 

For more than 25 years, the chain-termination method developed by
Sanger et a1. (1977) was the predominating method for DNA
sequencing. Pyrosequencing was one of the first methods for DNA
sequencing that is based on sequencing hy synthesis rather than
chain termination (Ronaghi er [1]., 1998). Since the late 1990s, fur-
ther next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have been de-
veloped and a technology development race started to achieve the
$1000 genome. Most of the NGS technologies such as 454
pyrosequencing (Margulies er [1]., 2005; Wheeler 61‘ (11., 2008) or
Illumina sequencing (Bentley 61‘ (11., 2008) rely on the generation of
light signals upon incorporation of one of the four nucleotides A, C,

G or T into the new DNA strand. In contrast, semiconductor
sequencing (Rothherg er [1]., 2011) uses a different approach that is
based on direct measurement of electric potential changes induced
by the release of protons (H+) during strand synthesis.

In semiconductor sequencing, the reaction wells are sequentially
flooded by one of the nucleotides A, C, G and T. Whenever the
offered nucleotide is complementary to the template DNA strand at
the actual position, it is incorporated into the new strand and in-
duces a change in the electric potential in the reaction well. Using
the scalahle technology of ion-sensitive field-effect transistors
(ISFET) organized in highly integrated circuits, millions of wells can
he interrogated at the same time. An ISFET detects a voltage signal,

only if the current nucleotide is complementary to the template at
the actual position, otherwise no signal is induced. If homopolymer
repeats are present in the template, multiple nucleotides are incorpo—
rated during a single flow. As incorporation of two nucleotides into
the new DNA strand doubles the voltage signal and incorporation
of multiple nucleotides into the new strand multiplies the voltage
signal, the length of the homopolymer stretch can be determined
based on the voltage.

Ion Torrent technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) allows
sequencing of templates of a length of up to 200 bp or 400 bp using
a novel chemistry. The Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) sys—
tem is suited for targeted sequencing of disease relevant regions of
the human genome or complete sequencing of smaller genomes, e.g.
of microbes. Ion PGM Sequencing 200 kit includes reagents for
sequencing of amplicons up to 200 bp. Using this sequencing kit, a
total number of 1000 flows can be executed, which are usually split
to 2 X 500 and running of two sequencing chips.

Here, we present an approach to compute the number of flows
required to sequence a DNA template of length 11. These are the
main results of our study: (i) while k : 3n + 1 flows are needed to
sequence each template of length n to the full length, in most situ—
ations, a much lower number of flows suffices. (ii) In a random se—
quence model, we calculate the cumulative distribution function of
the number of required flows and its expected value and variance.
(iii) We provide an algorithm to calculate the number of required
flows for a concrete amplicon panel from a BED file of genomic
positions.

In semiconductor sequencing, the sequencing depth and the num—
ber of flows are independent quantities. We present a formula to cal—
culate the sequencing depth from the number of amplicons and the
number of samples that are sequenced in parallel.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Stochastic model

We construct a stochastic model to calculate the number of required
flows to sequence a template of length n. The four nucleotides A, C,
G and T flow into the reaction well in a defined order that is re—
peated until the maximal number of flows k is reached (Fig. 1A). A
special situation occurs, when a homopolymer in the template is
reached. In this situation, the complementary homopolymer is
assembled during the one flow, leading to stronger change of pH
value and voltage. In the stochastic model, this situation can be ac—
counted for by not considering the assembly of the homopolymer in
one step, but by treating the incorporation of each of the nucleotides
separately. Using this trick, there are four different alternatives for
assembly at each position of the template: The nucleotide is incorpo—
rated after 0 flows (if the nucleotide is a repeat of the nucleotide be—
fore) or the nucleotide is incorporated after one to three flows (if the
nucleotide is not a repeat of the nucleotide before). Figure 1A illus—
trates the ongoing strand synthesis during four consecutive flows
and each of the four alternatives. Obviously, each of the four alter—
natives occurs with same probability P : i.

2.2 Calculation of the distribution function

As main ingredient for the stochastic model, we introduce four ran—
dom variables Xo,X1,X2 and X3 describing the number of positions
in the template, where 0, 1, 2 or 3 flows are needed for sequence as—
sembly at this position. Completing the model, we assume that the
random variables sum to up to the total number of nucleotides, X0

+X1+X2 +X3 : n and are distributed according to the multi—
nomial distribution with equal probabilities Po : P1 : P2 : P3 : i

n
P(Xo 2 no.X12 n1.X2 2 n2.X3 2 n3) 2  <3) . (1)
110.111.112.113. 4
After these preparations, the number of required flows to
sequence the template of length n is given by
F(X0,X1,X2,X3) : 0X0 + 1X1+ 2X2 + 3X3 + 1. The cumulative
distribution function of F can be calculated as

n 71-71] 71-71] —ng

P(F:k) 2 Z Z 2 0(n1 +2112 + 3113 + 1:10

n! 1 n
X (n —n1—n2 —n3)ln11nzln31  7

with the step function 0(xgxo) equaling 1 if xgxo and 0 ifx > x0.

Further, the expected value of the number of required flows can
be inferred from the expected value of the multinomial distribution
E(X,~) : %n as

. 3
E(F):ZzE(Xi)+1:Zn+1. (3)
Finally, inserting variance Var(X,-) : ﬁn and covariance
Cov(X,-, Xi) : —ﬁn of the multinomial distribution, we obtain the
variance of the number of required flows as

3
5
.2 .. 7
Var(F) : 12:01 Var(X,) + 2 E z/Cov(X,-,X,-) — Zn. (4)

05i<j53

Thus, we obtained exact expressions for expected value and vari—
ance of the number of required flows.

The cumulative distribution function was evaluated and visual—
ized using the statistical language R (R Core Team, 2014) and the R
package ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009).

2.3 Simulation of flows

An algorithm for simulation of the nucleotide flows and sequence
assembly was implemented in R and is available as package ionﬂows
from the CRAN repository (Bockmayr and Budczies, 2014). A BED
file with the genomic positions of the amplicons is taken as input
and a list with the number of required flows for each of the ampli—
cons is delivered as output. The number of flows is calculated separ—
ately for sequencing in forward direction and sequencing in
backward direction. As an example, the number of required flows
was calculated for six amplicon panels for targeted sequencing in
cancer research.

2.4 Sequencing depth

In semiconductor sequencing, parallel sequencing takes place in mil—
lions of wells of a sequencing chip. Each well contains a single mag—
netic head with clonal DNA attached. Typically, using a single chip,
multiple target sequences (amplicons) and several samples are
sequenced in parallel. In an ideal situation, all samples are covered
with the same depth and all amplicons are covered with the same
depth. In this situation, the sequencing depth d can calculated as

d 2 ﬂ. (5)

where e is the efficiency in using the chip (the percentage of wells
with suitable beads), to is the number of wells on the chips, m is the
number of samples (multiplexing) and a is the number of amplicons

Table 1. The number of required flows for six amplicon panels for targeted sequencing in cancer research. For each of the amplicons in a
panel, the target sequence was retrieved and the flows were simulated for both, sequencing in forward direction and sequencing in back-
ward direction. Values for amplicon length and for numbers of flows should be read as follows: mean value (minimum value — maximum
value). The number of amplicons that require more than 300 flows for complete coverage are shown in the last column

paraffin—embedded (FFPE) tissues available at pathology
laboratories are an invaluable resource for clinical research.
However, DNA extracted from FFPE tissues is fragmented and
chemically modified, which renders its use challenging for molecular
studies (Budczies et al., 2011; Hedegaard et al., 2014). To cope with
DNA fragmentation in sequencing studies, the length of fragments
in the library is usually chosen to be restricted to a length <150 bp.
In such situations, the split of the 1000 flows into three—thirds repre—
sents a convenient opportunity as we demonstrate in the above ex—
ample of the Ion Torrent technology.

Additionally, we implemented a simulation algorithm to calcu—
late the number of required flows to sequence a concrete panel of
genomic DNA sequences. Using this code, we analyzed six cancer
panels for targeted sequencing that are publicly available (Table 1).
For each of the panels, simulations were done to exactly calcu—
late the number of required flows for each of the amplicons
(Supplementary Material S1—S6). Four of the panels
(Comprehensive Cancer Panel Cancer, Cancer Hotspot Panel,
Colon and Lung Cancer Panel and TP53 Panel) were designed for
the analysis of DNA from FFPE tissues and included for the most
parts amplicons of length <15 0 bp. Accordingly, <300 flows were
sufficient to cover each of the amplicons of these panels. Thus, for
all of these panels, the 1000 flows can be split into three—thirds, sig—
nificantly saving operating time and costs. Both of the other panels
(AML Research Panel and BRCA1 and BRCA2 Panel) included
amplicons of length >200 bp. Accordingly, there were a few (6 and
8) amplicons that required more than 300 flows for complete
sequencing.

In targeted sequencing, multiplexing helps to enhance sample
throughput. Multiplexing can be done by adding barcodes to the
target sequences that uniquely label the samples. For the Ion Torrent
platform, 10—bp barcodes are available that can be used to label up
to 16 or up to 96 samples. As the barcodes are sequenced together
with the target sequences, extra flows are needed for barcode
sequencing. For 10 bp barcodes, maximal 30 flows are needed for
barcode sequencing. Thus, more than 300 flows are available for
sequencing of the targets when a split of 1000 flows into three—thirds
is used.

The 1000 available flows can be either used for two chips (stand—
ard protocol) or for three chips (modified protocol). Our simulations
show that 300 flows suffice to sequence all amplicons for each of
the first four panels in Table 1. Thus, the modified protocol instead
of the standard protocol can be used in these cases. Actually, the
first four panels were designed for FFPE tissues, whereas the last
two panels were designed for frozen tissues, include amplicon
lengths >150 bp and therefore require a higher number of flows. For
the last two panels, the standard protocol needs to be used to ensure

that all amplicons can be completely sequenced. The benefit of the
modified protocol compared the standard protocol is to decrease
both costs and instrument times: One third of the costs for sequenc—
ing kits can be saved and sequencer throughput can be enhanced
from two chips per day to three chips per day.

In semiconductor sequencing, the sequencing depth and the num—
ber of flows are independent quantities. In Section 2, we derived a
formula to calculate the sequencing depth from the number of
amplicons and the number of samples. However, in practice, differ—
ent amplicons in a panel are covered to a varying extend. Often,
there are several amplicons that perform considerably worse than
the average. There are recommendations of the chip manufacturer
available, how many samples should be run in parallel to obtain
30>< or 500>< coverage for 95% of the amplicons in a panel (Life
Technologies, 2014).

In summary, we presented an approach to determine the number
of nucleotide flows that are required in semiconductor sequencing.
In a model of random sequences, exact expressions were presented
for the cumulative distribution function of the number of flows, the
average number of flows and the corresponding variance.
Furthermore, we implemented an algorithm to calculate the number
of required flows for each of the items in a concrete list of genomic
DNA sequences. In targeted sequencing, our methods allow to cal—
culate the number of required flows for an amplicon panel and thus
to optimize time requirements and costs.

3.1 Description

The Web resource provides a user—friendly interface to search
and retrieve information related to influenza epitopes in
‘Epitope information resource’. Output of the search is presented
in a tabular format, which contains strain coverage and immuno—
genic information of epitopes. ‘Epitope combination explorer’
explores different combinations of inﬂuenza epitopes using
FSA. There are two options to submit epitope sequences into
this module: (i) Selection of an epitope from dropdown menu of
corresponding proteins [mouse on epitope sequence in the ‘list
box’ displays a hover showing information about its immune
response, and coverage in strains (global, continents—wise
and vaccine, strains), subtypes and their host organism] and
(ii) insertion of epitope sequence is provided in the text box.
The epitope combination explorer provides similar information
as ‘Epitope information resource’ about conservation and
immune response, but for a combination of selected epitopes.

3.2 Conservation of epitopes according to strain, subtype
and host type

Epitope from HA, GLFGAIAGFI, has maximum strain cover—
age and is conserved in 27 402 strains. Top 10 epitopes from HA
protein have conservation range between 27402 and 13761
strains. In the Web resource, strain coverage information of
each epitope is hovered so that user can select conserved epi—
topes. Strain coverage data of top 10 epitopes of each protein
is given in Supplementary Table S1.

3.3 Performance of the FSA for UIV design

When the epitope with maximum strain coverage,
GLFGAIAGFI, was used as an initial epitope for FSA and all
other epitopes were added automatically based on maximum
cumulative strain coverage of combined epitopes (Refer Section
2.4 and Supplementary Fig. S1), nine epitopes were selected from
ﬁve proteins (4 HA, 2 NA, 1 M1, 1 NP and 1 NS1) covering
51222 of total 57414 strains of inﬂuenza A virus (Table 1).
Epitopes 1, 3 and 7 provide CTL immune responses. Epitopes
binding to major histocompatibility complex II allele were taken
as Th—ce11 epitopes. Interestingly, other six epitopes are known to

induce Th immune response, which is crucial to encounter viral
infection (Tan et al., 2011). First and seventh CTL and second
and fifth Th epitopes are known to bind with multiple HLA
supertypes, indicating their applicability to global human
population.

Epitope—based vaccine, Multimeric—001, is composed of nine
epitopes (four BCE and one Th epitope from HA protein, two
CTL and one Th from NP protein and one peptide that contains
both BCE and CTL epitope from M1 protein), and epitopes
forming this vaccine have coverage of only 30 848 strains of in—
fluenza A virus (Supplementary Table S2) in comparison with
51 222 strains’ coverage for nine—epitope combination discovered
in the present work by FSA. Besides coverage, the FSA—dis—
covered combination of epitopes is expected to induce better
immune response and population coverage that is important in
vaccine design against inﬂuenza virus.

4 DISCUSSION

The EpiComelu resource has been developed to assist vaccinol—
ogists in producing epitope—based UIVs. Different combinations
of epitopes (potential UIVs with optimum strain coverage) can
be identified by using FSA with different initial epitope(s). The
combination of epitopes can be expressed as synthetic protein
and its UIV potential could be checked. As evolutionary con—
served epitopes are from functionally important parts of pro—
teins, these immunogenic parts are, therefore, expected to be
retained by new pandemic strains (McMurry et al., 2008). The
developed vaccine containing these epitopes is anticipated to pre—
vent or mitigate infection by pandemic strains. The performance
of EpiComelu server does not depend on initially selected epi—
topes. Many independent studies were carried out to verify
whether selection of different combinations of epitopes can
alter the strain coverage (Supplementary Table S2). In first
case, instead of taking an epitope with maximum strain coverage
as the initial epitope, a 20—1ength epitope from HA was taken,
and FSA was used to ﬁnd out combination of epitopes with
optimal strain coverage. Similarly, in the second case, the same
20—1ength epitope was taken as the initial epitope, and only 310—
1ength epitopes were used subsequently for combination by FSA

(Supplementary Table S2). The FSA method was able to find
combination of nine epitopes having ~90% strain coverage.
Even when four BCEs with low strain coverage were used as
starting epitopes, FSA was effective in getting epitope combin—
ations having >85% strain coverage. This outcome of FSA jus—
tifies that the strain coverage is not dependent on selection of
initial epitopes. Even if the user likes to include one or more
epitopes (i.e. known to be highly immunogenic) for developing
a UIV, the Web resource (FSA) can easily combine other data—
base epitopes to get maximum strain coverage (Supplementary
Table S2).

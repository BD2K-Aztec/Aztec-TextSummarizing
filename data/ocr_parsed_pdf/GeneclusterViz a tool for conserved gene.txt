ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene clusters are arrangements of functionally related
genes on a chromosome. ln bacteria, it is expected that evolutionary
pressures would conserve these arrangements due to the functional
advantages they provide. Visualization of conserved gene clusters
across multiple genomes provides key insights into their evolutionary
histories. Therefore, a software tool that enables visualization and
functional analyses of gene clusters would be a great asset to the
biological research community.

Results: We have developed GeneclusterViz, a Java-based tool that
allows for the visualization, exploration and downstream analyses of
conserved gene clusters across multiple genomes. GeneclusterViz
combines an easy-to-use exploration interface for gene clusters
with a host of other analysis features such as multiple sequence
alignments, phylogenetic analyses and integration with the KEGG
pathway database.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in sequencing technology and ortholog detection
methods have given rise to several methods for the detection of gene
clusters conserved across two or more genomes (Calabrese et (11.,
2003; Fujibuchi et (11., 2000; Haas et (11., 2004; Kim et (11., 2007;
Yang and Sze, 2008; Zheng et (11., 2005). However, gene cluster
information obtained from these programs has been very difﬁcult
to analyze for bench scientists due to the lack of a more intuitive
analysis tool. The visualization of gene clusters in multiple genomes,
with respect to their spatial and functional features is a fundamental
problem in this area.

There are currently several visualization tools that have been
developed for a variety of applications in comparative genomics

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

[reviewed in Nielsen et (11. (2010)]. A subset of these have been
designed for the visualization of gene clusters. However, these tools
are limited in different ways. In some cases, only paired-genome
visualization is supported. Even in multi-genome visualization,
scalability is a challenge and, thus, limits the utility of web-based
tools. Moreover, web-based tools rely on server-hosted data and
cannot utilize data provided by users. This is true even in the
case of Absynte, a tool that was recently developed speciﬁcally for
the task of visualizing bacterial and archaeal clusters [Despalins
et (11. (2011)]. Standalone applications overcome these drawbacks
but involve cumbersome installation procedures or database setups
that demand programming skills beyond that of most end-users.
Finally, existing gene cluster visualization tools are limited in their
support for further downstream analyses. We have implemented
GeneclusterViz, a robust and dynamic standalone tool that provides
a global and local View of gene clusters. Moreover, with a host
of ﬂexible sequence and function analysis features, we believe
GeneclusterViz can be a very useful tool in comparative genomics.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

GeneclusterViz has been implemented in Java (JDK 1.6). For the
construction and depiction of phylogenetic trees, the Phylogenetic
Analysis library was used (Drummond and Strimmer, 2001). To
establish a server connection and to communicate with the back-end
CGI program, the Jakarta Commons HTTPClient Java library from
Apache Commons has been used. The server-side CGI programs and
wrappers that run CLUSTAL W (Thompson et (11., 1994), HMMER
v2.3.2 (Eddy, 1998) and KEGG pathway searches have been written
in Perl.

3 FEATURES

The features of GeneclusterViz can be summarized into four broad
categories—input, visualization, exploration and analyses features.

Input: GeneclusterViz accepts output ﬁles from the EGGS [Kim
et (11. (2007)] and PhyloEGGS [part of ISGA; Hemmerich et (11.
(2010)] algorithms. These ﬁles are mainly tab-delimited plain-
text formats that contain NC numbers and NCBI GI numbers as
identiﬁers for genomes and individual gene products, respectively.

GeneclusterViz

 

GeneclusterViz also accepts gene family ﬁles in an in-house ﬁle
format (GFAM) that was developed to represent genes from common
COG families.

Visualization: Users can easily zoom-in/out of cluster
visualizations with respect to both the X and Y -axes. The
‘Connect Clusters’ feature displays all the connections between
clusters across multiple genomes. Individual clusters can be
accessed by clicking on a cluster in the table-pane on the left of the
GeneclusterViz window. This highlights the particular cluster on
the genome. The ‘Connect Genes’ feature displays how individual
genes are connected in the highlighted cluster. The order in which
the genomes are displayed can also be changed through a draggable
list. Given a Newick tree ﬁle, the ‘Phylogeny View’ allows for the
visualization of genomes in terms of their clades. These orderings
are particularly useﬁil if a user is interested in focusing on a subset
of the input genomes.

Analyses: At the main GeneclusterViz window, upon double-
clicking on a cluster entry in the table-pane, a new window displays
a zoomed-in detailed view of that particular cluster. The genes are
color-coded as per COG broad ﬁinctional categories. One can view
annotation information for a gene by simply mousing over that
particular gene. Clicking on a particular gene in the cluster highlights
the connection across the multiple genomes. If this highlighted
connection is double-clicked, a new window with the sequences
of the gene products is opened. These sequences can then be run
through CLUSTAL W to generate a multiple sequence alignment
and a phylogenetic tree can be built for their gene products. The
corresponding pathway from KEGG can also be obtained.

Exploration: Users can search for their genes of interest by
providing their names or locus tags. GeneclusterViz can identify
which clusters the speciﬁed genes are in and generates a table
with the input genes against the corresponding cluster number.
The clusters can then be accessed directly from the table. Another
exploration feature is the capacity to add a new genome, given
an existing multi-genome cluster prediction. GeneclusterViz allows
for the input of a new genome and incorporates a feature which
checks whether a given cluster is present in the new genome or not.
It achieves this by establishing a connection to a back-end server
that performs a proﬁle-model-based HMM search (using HMMER)
to identify conserved cluster members in the new genome. In this
case, relaxed criteria for cluster identiﬁcation have been adopted
(HMMER E-value <10 which is the default and no proximity
constraint on signiﬁcant hits). Once the cluster has been identiﬁed

in the newly input genome, it is displayed in the detailed view, along
with the cluster in the other genomes for manual investigation.

4 DSCUSSON

GeneclusterViz serves not only as a user-friendly tool for the
visualization of gene clusters across multiple genomes but also as
a workspace for extensive research on these clusters. It tackles
the non-trivial task of providing access and information about
multiple conserved clusters across multiple genomes. There are
several applications that GeneclusterViz can be used for including
phylogenetic studies, pathway studies and gene function assignment.
Thus, it is expected to help bench scientists in understanding the
functional relationship between genes in conserved clusters across
the evolutionary spectrum of genomes.

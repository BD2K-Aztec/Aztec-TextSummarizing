ABSTRACT

Summary: Pathway-level analysis is a powerful approach enabling
interpretation of post-genomic data at a higher level than that of
individual biomolecules. Yet, it is currently hard to integrate more
than one type of omics data in such an approach. Here, we present a
web tool ‘lMPaLA’ for the joint pathway analysis of transcriptomics or
proteomics and metabolomics data. It performs over-representation
or enrichment analysis with user-specified lists of metabolites and
genes using over 3000 pre-annotated pathways from 11 databases.
As a result, pathways can be identified that may be disregulated
on the transcriptional level, the metabolic level or both. Evidence
of pathway disregulation is combined, allowing for the identification
of additional pathways with changed activity that would not be
highlighted when analysis is applied to any of the functional levels
alone. The tool has been implemented both as an interactive website
and as a web service to allow a programming interface.
Availability: The web interface of IMPaLA is available at
http://impa|a.molgen.mpg.de. A web services programming interface
is provided at http://impala.molgen.mpg.de/wsdoc.

1 INTRODUCTION

Systems biology aims at the concerted analysis of biological systems
at different levels, for example the combination of transcriptomics,
proteomics and metabolomics. Biochemical pathways are the
primary focus of systems biology. Pathways are extensively
used to interpret omics data, for example to gain mechanistic
insight into gene disregulation, which is causative or indicative
of complex diseases. In particular, pathway over-representation
(ORA) and enrichment analyses have become important tools for
the interpretation of data from transcriptomics (Riedel et al., 2008)
and metabolomics (Sabatine et al., 2005) experiments.

Several web-based tools exist for such pathway analyses on
transcriptomic or metabolomic data separately (Chagoyen and
Pazos, 2011; Huang et al., 2008; Kamburov et al., 2011; Xia and
Wishart, 2010), but to our knowledge no tools exist yet for integrated
pathway analysis with both types of data simultaneously. In a recent
study (Cavill et al., 2011), a method for the integrated analysis of
transcriptomic and metabolomic data was proposed that exploits
the fact that genes and metabolites are linked through biochemical
reactions and thus are contained in many pathways. Here, we report
the implementation of this method, providing a web server called
Integrated Molecular Pathway-Level Analysis (IMPaLA) for the
combined analysis of gene/protein and metabolite datasets using a
comprehensive basis of biochemical pathways currently taken from
11 publicly available resources. We illustrate the use of the website
and exemplify the beneﬁt of combined analysis of transcriptomics
and metabolomics data. IMPaLA is accessible through an interactive
website or through web services.

2 DESCRIPTION

Web interface: the web interface at http://impala.molgen.mpg.de
gives the user the possibility to upload genes and/or metabolites in
several identiﬁer namespaces and to perform over-representation
or Wilcoxon enrichment analysis (WEA) (Adjaye et al., 2005)
with the available pathways (Fig. 1A). These pathways (currently
3073) originate from 11 public databases such as Reactome
(http://www.reactome.org), KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
or Wikipathways (http://www.wikipathways.org). For ORA,
the user uploads lists of identiﬁers that typically represent
genes/proteins/metabolites signiﬁcantly associated with the effect
of interest. In addition, background lists of identiﬁers representing
all measured genes/proteins and/or metabolites can be uploaded.
This is especially useful when the list of measured entities is small
compared with the number of genes/proteins or metabolites in
the organism, to avoid potential bias. If no background lists are
speciﬁed by the user, all entities present in pathways and annotated
in the user-speciﬁed identiﬁer namespaces are used as default
background lists. Based on the uploaded lists, the hypergeometric
distribution is used to assess the signiﬁcance of each pathway in
terms of its overlap with those lists.

For WEA, the user uploads lists of all measured genes/proteins
and/or metabolites (rather than just the signiﬁcant ones as in ORA)
with either one or a pair of numerical values per entity. These values

Fig. 1. (A) IMPaLA (version 1) input screen including the logos of the 11
source databases. (B) Output screen with a ranked list of pathways showing;
(i) a link to each pathway in the source database; (ii) the size of each pathway

may represent fold changes or average expression/concentration
values for two different experimental conditions. The values are
used to assess the joint expression/concentration difference of all
entities contained in each pathway through Wilcoxon’s signed-
rank test. Even if a pathway contains no individual entities
with signiﬁcant differential expression or concentration, the joint
expression/concentration of the group of pathway members may be
signiﬁcantly changed, indicating potential pathway disregulation on
a low but nonetheless consistent level. Results from both ORA and
WEA analyses are presented by IMPaLA as tables listing pathways
that contain at least one gene and/or metabolite from the input lists
(Fig. 1B). Information about pathway name, source, size and overlap
with the input entities is provided along with P-values calculated
with appropriate statistical test for each pathway. Notably, if both
metabolites and genes/proteins are uploaded by the user, a joint
P-value is given, calculated as per Cavill et al. (2011). To control
for multiple testing, Q-values are calculated with the false discovery
rate method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Results can be sorted
on any column by clicking on the appropriate column header, and
can be downloaded as a tab-delimited ﬁle. By clicking on a pathway
name, the user is guided to a summary web page at the original
source database, which in most cases also shows a detailed pathway
diagram.

Example: using publicly available data from the NCI60 (Scherf
et al., 2000), we selected the genes and metabolites that were
signiﬁcantly correlated with the G150 values for the common cancer
therapeutic 5-ﬂurouracil (5-FU) across the 58 cell lines as in previous
work (Cavill et al., 2011) (see Files Sl—S4 in Supplementary
Material that includes background). Full results of the IMPaLA
ORA analysis on this data can be found in File 5 in Supplementary
Material. The top seven pathways are based entirely on the over-
representation of genes, and mainly relate to the ribosome or to
eukaryotic translation. For the ABC Transporter pathway, neither
genes nor metabolites alone gave P < 0.05, yet Pjoim =0.049. This
example demonstrates that metabolic information gives added value
to the genome-wide analysis enhanced the pathway recovery. For
further examples and help, please see the tutorial document provided
in File S7 in Supplementary Material.

Web service: in addition to the standard interactive web interface,
the functionality provided can also be accessed through a SOAP web
service. Here, functions are available that carry out ORA or WEA
with lists of genes, of metabolites or both. The web service deﬁnition
(WSDL) ﬁle and the appropriate documentation are available at
http://impala.molgen.mpg.de/wsdoc.

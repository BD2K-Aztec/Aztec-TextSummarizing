Abstract

Motivation: PIWI—interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non—coding RNAs that are highly
abundant in the germline. One important role of piRNAs is to defend genome integrity by guiding
PIWI proteins to silence transposable elements (TEs), which have a high potential to cause deleteri—
ous effects on their host. The mechanism of piRNA—mediated post—transcriptional silencing was
also observed to affect mRNAs, suggesting that piRNAs might play a broad role in gene expression
regulation. However, there has been no systematic report with regard to how many protein—coding
genes might be targeted and regulated by piRNAs.

Results: We trained a support vector machine classifier based on a combination of Miwi CLIP—Seq—
derived features and position—derived features to predict the potential targets of piRNAs on mRNAs
in the mouse. Reanalysis of a published microarray dataset suggested that the expression level of
the 2587 protein—coding genes predicted as piRNA targets showed significant upregulation as a
whole after abolishing the slicer activity of Miwi, supporting the conclusion that they are subject to
piRNA—mediated regulation.

1 Introduction

PIWI—interacting RNAs (piRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and
short—interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are three major classes of small
RNAs (Saxe and Lin, 2011). piRNAs differ from miRNAs and
siRNAs in several aspects: (1) piRNAs show specific expression in

conservation in either sequence or secondary structure(Le Thomas
et (11., 2014), except that there is a preference for a 5’ uridine (U)
residue and an adenosine as the tenth nucleotide(Dannemann et (11.,
2012); (4) piRNAs bind to Piwi—clade Argonauts, Whereas miRNAs
and siRNAs associate with the Ago—clade Argonauts (Khurana and
Theurkauf, 2008); and (5) most piRNAs are derived from genomic
piRNA clusters, which are discrete regions containing a large num—

germ cells (Houwing et (11., 2007); (2) most piRNAs have lengths in
the range of 25—33 nt (Sai Lakshmi and Agrawal, 2008), greater

than those of miRNAs and siRNAs, which are 20—23 nt in most
cases, although Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs with the unusual
length of 21 nt constitute an exception to the general rule (Kim
et (11., 2009; Weick and Miska, 2014); (3) piRNAs do not show any

ber of various types of transposable elements (TEs) (Theron et (11.,
2014). Besides, piRNAs have distinguished biogenesis mechanisms
which are independent of Dicer (Aravin et (11., 2007). The recently
reported phased manner of piRNA biogenesis further supports that

piRNAs are more diverse than other classes of small RNAs (Han
et (11., 2015; Mohn et (11., 2015; Siomi and Siomi, 2015).

The existence of piRNAs represents adaptive control mechan—
isms that protect the genomic architecture against TEs, which con—
stitute a large fraction of the mammalian genome and are a constant
threat to the host (Kelleher and Barbash, 2013; Reuter et (11., 2011;
Zamudio and Bourc’his, 2010). PIWI proteins participate in the
piRNA pathway(Le Thomas et (11., 2013; Ross et (11., 2014; Siomi
et (11., 2011). The mutation of Miwi in the mouse results in male in—
fertility and the upregulation of LINE1 retrotransposon transcripts
(Reuter et (11., 2011). There have been similar observations made in
ﬂies when mutations in piwi, dub or Ag03 occurred (Siomi et (11.,
2011). The silencing machinery is similar to that of siRNAs and
miRNAs (Ishizu et (11., 2012; Reuter et (11., 2011). A piRNA recog—
nizes a transposon transcript target by complementarity, and the
interacting PIWI protein then slices via its catalytic domain, cleaving
the target at a position 10—nt downstream of the 5’ end of the
piRNA, generating a 5’—m0n0phosphate containing fragment (Ishizu
et (11., 2012; Reuter et (11., 2011).

Recent studies suggest that piRNA—mediated cleavage acts not
only on TEs (Weick and Miska, 2014) but also on mRNAs (Aravin
et (11., 2001; Nishida et (11., 2007; Rouget et (11., 2010; Saito et (11.,
2009; Zhang et (11., 2015). In silkworm, Kiuchi et al. (2014) even dis—
covered that a single piRNA is responsible for primary sex determin—
ation by mediating cleavage of the Masc mRNA, demonstrating the
functional importance of piRNA—mediated cleavage on mRNA. Our
previous study revealed widespread Miwi/piRNA—mediated mRNA
cleavage events in mouse testes and demonstrated the functional im—
portance of the temporal cleavage of piRNA target mRNAs for sper—
miogenesis (Zhang et (11., 2015). Taking advantage of published
global 5’ RACE (rapid amplification of 5’ complementary DNA ends)
tags, we previously identified 169 piRNA—targeted mRNAs (Zhang
et (11., 2015). The role of piRNAs in mediating mRNA cleavage is also
evidenced in C. elegans (Lee et (11., 2012) and D. melanogaster
(Brower—Tolandet 111., 2007). However, there has been no systematic
assessment with respect to how many protein—coding genes might be
regulated by a piRNA—guided cleavage mechanism.

In this study, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) classi—
fier to predict potential piRNA targets on protein—coding genes.
Because base—pairing recognition by piRNAs as well as the physical
association of Miwi are both critical for piRNA—guided cleavage in
mouse male germ cells, the anti—Miwi crosslinking immunoprecipi—
tation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP—seq) data that we pro—
duced recently was used to obtain both piRNAs and target
fragments. In particular, we introduced a combination of CLIP—Seq—
derived features and position—derived features. In contrast to the pre—
vious identification of piRNA targets from 5’ RACE tags, which is
restricted to the sequencing depth, we have undertaken a genome—
wide scan across all sites of mRNA transcripts and computationally
identified 3781 mRNAs of 25 87 protein—coding genes as potential
piRNA targets. This result was further validated by a microarray
dataset that presented gene expression differences between catalytic
mutant without Miwi slicer activity and the wild type. The dataset
of piRNA targets in mRNAs is available for browsing, searching
and download via http://www.regulatoryrna.org/software/piRNA/
piRNA_target_mRNA/index.php.

2 Methods

2.1 Biologically relevant dataset
The potential piRNA target sites that we recently identified (Zhang
et (11., 2015) were used as positive examples of our training dataset.

We have previously reported 169 protein—coding genes with 193 tar—
get sites of piRNAs. Two protein—coding genes were removed be—
cause they have multiple genomic loci on different chromosomes.
Consequently, the positive examples of our training dataset consist
of 191 target sites in 167 protein—coding genes.

To construct reliable negative examples for the training dataset,
we referred to the published microarray data performed on wild type
and Miwi mutant mouse testis in two replicates (Reuter et (11., 2011).
Considering that the expression level of genes that were not targeted
by piRNAs should not be inﬂuenced when the slicer activity of Miwi
is disrupted, we first extracted genes that showed little change in ex—
pression between wild type and the Miwi mutant (data from GEO:
GSE32180). To equalize the amount of positive and negative ex—
amples, 191 were randomly selected from the resulting 3071 protein—
coding genes that had an expression level not affected by the Miwi
mutation. Each of these genes contributes one site by random selec—
tion, generating 191 sites as negative examples for the training dataset
(See Supplementary Fig. S1 for details). Thus, the final size of the data—
set was 382 sites from 358 specific protein—coding genes.

2.2 Antimiwi CLIP—seq processing

Anti—Miwi CLIP—seq was performed as described previously (Xue
et (11., 2013) and deposited in the GEO database under the accession
number GSE67683. The sequenced reads were first mapped to the
mouse genome (mm9) using Bowtie (Langmeadet 111., 2009). The
reads that were successfully mapped were further classified into
piRNAs and Miwi targets according to their length (Fig. 1). Reads
with a length of 25—33 nt were classified as piRNAs, whereas longer
reads (36 nt) were classified as Miwi targets. Reads with a shorter
length were discarded because it was difficult to determine to which
class they belonged. Of the ~48 million reads that were mapped to
the mouse genome, a total of ~17 million reads corresponded to

piRNAs and ~10 million reads correspond to Miwi targets. Miwi
targets with more than one genomic location were excluded from
further consideration.

2.3 Support vector machine

We used an SVM (Boser, 1992) to build a classifier discriminating
the target sites of piRNAs on mRNAs. SVM mapped the sample vec—
tors into a high—dimensional feature space in which the samples may
be separated by an optimal boundary through the kernel transform—
ation. In our study, a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was used:

14er Xi) = eXp(-vler-Xrll2)

where the parameter y determines the similarity level of the features.
In practice, a separating hyperplane may not exist when a problem
is very noisy or complex. Thus slack variables 5,- Z 0 for all
i : 1 . . .n are introduced to loosen the constraints as follows
(Bennett and Mangasarian, 1992):

Yi((WrXr)+b) Z 1 — ii for all i: 1,. . .,n.

A classifier that generalizes well is then obtained by adjusting
both the classifier capacity  and the sum of the slacks Z; 5;,
which can be realized by minimizing the following objective
function:

1 [1
lewll2+CZ r.
i:1

subject to the constraints on 5i and (2), where the constant C > 0 de—
termines the trade—off between margin maximization and training
error minimization. Consequently, two parameters, y and C should
be determined in the classification model.

2.4 SVM features

The SVM features that were used for classifier training were catego—
rized into two groups: anti—Miwi CLIP—Seq—derived features and
position—derived features. An analysis of anti—Miwi CLIP—Seq re—
sulted in two features for a site to be predicted: the enrichment of 5’
ends of distinct piRNAs at position 10 nt downstream of the site and
the enrichment of target fragments that were detected in the Miwi
complex mapping to a region ranging from 150 nt upstream to 150
nt downstream of the site (Fig. 1). To generate the piRNA enrich—
ment, the full—length mRNA sequences of the RefSeq database
(Pruitt et (11., 2012) were scanned by Bowtie to search for sites with
a possible piRNA interaction. Complementary base—pairing focused
on the first 21 nucleotides from the 5’ end of piRNAs by an imper—
fect pattern. No more than three mismatches were allowed. At the
same time, at least one perfect match for the first three nucleotides
from the 5’ end of piRNAs was required. piRNA enrichment for a
given site is calculated as the number of distinct piRNAs with 5’
ends that are located exactly 10 nt downstream of the target site
based on base—pairing complementarity to the ﬂanking sequence.
piRNAs interacting with more than 100 mRNAs were eliminated
because their targeting might result from the complementary base—
pairing of simple sequence repeats that were difficult to distinguish
from random hits. Additionally, the genomic locations of Miwi tar—
gets were compared to those of mRNAs by BEDTools (Quinlan,
2014). The enrichment of Miwi targets for a specific site was
counted as the number of Miwi target reads overlapping the neigh—
boring region of the site with 150 nt extended upstream and down—
stream. An empirical value of 155 was set as the upper limit for the
enrichment of Miwi targets. Both of the anti—Miwi CLIP—Seq—derived
features had quantitative values.

For position—derived features, we incorporated information from
three aspects. First, the position of the candidate target site was
compared to the architecture of the mRNA to which it belongs to
determine whether it was located in the 5’UTR, CDS or 3’UTR.
Second, 10 neighboring nucleotides upstream and downstream of
the target site were extracted, generating a sequence of 20 nucleo—
tides with the target site exactly in the middle. The sequence was
then scanned to determine whether it consisted of short repeats (k—
mer tandem repeat in which [2 : 2, 3 or 4). Third, the nucleotide se—
lection (the use of A, U, C and G) at the 20 nucleotide positions rep—
resented the remaining features. All of the position—derived features
had qualitative values (0 or 1). In total, we obtained a feature space
of 86 dimensions, and all of the feature values were normalized to
have real values with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

2.5 Parameter optimization and classifier evaluation
Before applying a trained SVM classifier for large—scale prediction,
the performance of our method should be evaluated. We first div—
ided our dataset by random selection into two groups: 70% in the
first group for SVM classifier training and the remaining 30% in the
second group for independent validation. Data for validation should
not participate in any of the steps of classifier training. Before train—
ing the SVM classifier on the first group, we should determine in ad—
vance two SVM parameters, y and C, by 10—fold cross validation.
The first group is further divided into 10 subgroups of equal size by
random sampling. At each sampling, nine subgroups were used to
train an SVM classifier given a specific pair of values for y and C,
while the remaining subgroup was used to test the performance of
the trained classifier. The average prediction accuracy of the 10—fold
cross validation was recorded to represent the performance of the
specific pair of values for y and C. After all of the combinations of
values for y and C were tested, the best pair of values was selected
according to the best prediction accuracy. The SVM classifiers were
trained on the whole of the first group with the selected parameters
and applied to the second group. The sensitivity and specificity of
prediction were calculated by setting different thresholds of the
SVM score, thus generating an ROC curve that had an area that rep—
resented the performance of the SVM classifier. A larger area under
the curve indicated better performance. To avoid possible bias in
one categorization, the assessment described above was repeated 10
times and the ROC curve was plotted with the specificity and sensi—
tivity averaged from the result of 10 repeated evaluations. Because a
genome—wide prediction would be conducted across all of the sites
of the full—length mRNA transcripts, evaluation at the gene level is
more important. The evaluation at the gene level was different from
previous evaluations in that a gene was considered a piRNA target
as long as it contained at least one site that was predicted as ‘posi—
tive’ after all of its sites are scanned by the classifier.

2.6 Functional enrichment of piRNA target genes

A functional enrichment analysis was performed for predicted
piRNA target genes with the GO Enrichment Analysis Software
Toolkit (GOEAST) (Zheng and Wang, 2008). The resulting GO
terms with a P—value<0.05 and log—odds ratio (LR) > 0.7 were con—
sidered statistically significant.

2.7 Public microarray data analysis

As described previously (Zhang et (11., 2015), the raw data (CEL file
format) for samples of round spermatids (GSE32180) (Reuter et (11.,
2011) and elongating spermatids (GSE59291) (Reuteret 111., 2011)
from adult mouse testes were downloaded and load into R (Team,

2011). Signal intensities were normalized and log2 transformed by
the affy package and rma package. For comparison of gene expres—
sion levels between the two different platforms, the expression levels
were further normalized by the limma package.

3 Results

3.1 Performance of the SVM classifier

The performance of the SVM classifier was evaluated at two levels,
the site level and the gene level, following the steps that were
described in the Methods section. At the site level, a test applying a
set of different threshold values to the SVM scores resulted in an
area under the ROC curve of 87.25% (Fig. 2a), with a specificity of
89.48% and a sensitivity of 63.91% corresponding to a default
threshold of zero. Since the trained SVM classifier would be applied
to scan all of the sites across the full—length of the mRNA sequence
of a candidate target gene to determine whether it is a target of
piRNAs, the performance of the SVM classifier was reevaluated at
the gene level. After all of the sites were scanned, an mRNA was
determined as a potential target of piRNAs if it contained at least
one site that was classified as ‘positive’. The reevaluation gave an
area under the ROC curve of 75.55% at the gene level (Fig. 2b),
whereas the default threshold of zero resulted in a specificity of
82.07% and a sensitivity of 62.75%.

3.2 Identification of piRNA targets on mRNAs

A final SVM classifier was built based on the whole training dataset
with the y and C parameters optimized by a grid search upon
10—fold cross validation. The classifier was then applied to a total of
28 050 mRNAs from the mouse (the 358 genes used as training ex—
amples as well as genes with multiple genomic loci were excluded in
advance) with a default threshold of zero. This generated a list of
3781 mRNAs from 25 87 genes which contained 12 233 potential
target sites which may be cleaved by piRNAs. On average, each tar—
get mRNA harbored more than three target sites. The distribution
of number of predicted target sites harbored by each mRNA is
shown in Figure 3a. It was also observed that piRNA target sites
were enriched near the 3’ ends of the mRNAs (Fig. 3b). Further ana—
lysis of flanking bases revealed a strong bias for U at the mRNA
cleavage site and for A 10 nt downstream of the U residue (Fig. 3c).

Khurana and Theurkauf (2008) reported on genes that had
mRNA expression levels that showed significant changes after trun—
cation of the slicer activity of Miwi. These data were used to verify
our predictions, considering that piRNA targeting genes should
have elevated expression levels when the piRNA—guided cleavage
mechanism was obstructed. The expression difference of the 25 87
predicted piRNA target genes between the Miwi mutant and wild
type has a positive trend compared with other genes (Fig. 4a), sug—
gesting that the prediction result captures a substantial number of
actual piRNA target genes.

Moreover, we found a significant decrease in the expression level
of 2587 predicted piRNA target genes in elongating spermatids
(GSE5 9291) compared with those in round spermatids (GSE32180)
based on global expression profiling analysis (Fig. 4b). This result
might be explained by the hypothesis that piRNAs ensure germ cell
development by suppressing specific genes through a cleavage
mechanism.

The predicted piRNA target genes were then subjected to path—
way enrichment analysis (Fig. 5). Nearly one—quarter of the target
genes were associated with metal ion binding. In addition, a signifi—
cant proportion of the total predicted target genes were enriched in
the regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process and biosyn—
thetic process. Although piRNAs had been considered to have spe—
cific expression in germ cells, this result suggests that piRNAs might
have largely unexplored functions.

3.3 Contribution of each feature

To investigate which features were most important in piRNA tar—
get prediction, we ranked all features by data mining. The OneR
classifier and Ranker methods of the Weka software were used to
evaluate the features, and the 20 most important features are
shown in Table 1. Miwi CLIP—Seq—derived features occupied the
first two positions in the rank. Of them, piRNA enrichment was
the most important. mRNA fragment enrichment, as inferred from
Miwi CLIP—Seq, was the second most important, further indicating
that Miwi is necessary in the piRNA—guided cleavage mechanism.
The third ranked feature concerns about genomic annotation, with
3’UTR being preferred. Next are features regarding the nucleotide
composition. Of all the positions along the sequence of 20 nucleo—
tides, the preference of uracil (U) at the first position and adenine

3.4 Characteristics of mRNA—targeting piRNAs

Of all of the piRNAs that were identified by the anti—Miwi CLIP—Seq
experiment, 16 657 piRNA reads representing 3385 different piRNA
species contributed to cleavage of the predicted targets on mRNAs.
The length profile of these piRNA species showed a stronger peak at
30 nt than that of the total piRNA species from the anti—Miwi CLIP—
Seq (Fig. 6a). An unexpected large percentage of these mRNA—target—
ing piRNA species (~88.54%) were derived from repetitive genomic
sequences, whereas the corresponding percentage of repeat—derived
piRNAs in the total piRNA population from the anti—Miwi CLIP—Seq
data was less than 30% (Fig. 6b). Among the different repeat classes,
the SINE family constituted the highest proportion (~66.44%), with
Alu—like elements representing largest amount within the SINEs
(~42.48%). A de novo motif analysis was performed by the MEME
Suite (Bailey et al., 2009) and discovered a significant consensus se—
quence residing in these mRNA—targeting piRNAs (Fig. 6c). More
than 700 mRNA—targeting piRNA species harbored the identified
motif starting from the first nucleotide at the 5’ end. The bias towards
U at the 5’ end and A at the tenth position downstream indicated the
ping—pong interaction. Nontheless, this motif only represented ~23%
of all of the mRNA—targeting piRNA species, indicating that this motif
alone would be inadequate to distinguish mRNA—regulating piRNAs.

Using the piRNA targets that we previously identified (Zhang et al.,
2015) as positive examples of our training dataset, we made

genome—wide de novo predictions and provided a much larger list of
mRNAs that might be targeted and cleaved by piRNAs. In this
study, we took advantage of CLIP—Seq data, which are specific to
fragments that are bound by the Miwi protein, whereas the previous
study was based on 5’ RACE sequencing data, which contains not
only fragments that are produced by piRNA—mediated cleavage but
also other biological processes. Moreover, the previous study was
restricted to the coverage of 5’ RACE sequencing data on mRNAs,
whereas the depth of the CLIP—Seq data that were used in this study
makes it possible to systematic explore piRNA targets on mRNAs.
In addition, the incorporation of position—derived features enabled
the discovery of piRNA target sites that might be missed by the ab—
sence of complementary piRNAs from sequenced reads. Our method
presents robustness as repeated random selection of negative ex—
amples for training the model did not resulted in much difference
with regarding to the predicted list of piRNA target genes. It could
also be applied to other tissue types which have both training ex—
amples and anti—Miwi CLIP—Seq data.

In addition to the repression of mRNAs by cleavage in this study,
another repression mechanism is mediated by piRNAs that induces
mRNA deadenylation, resulting in mRNA degradation. For ex—
ample, piRNAs target the nanos 3’ UTR with imperfect complemen—
tarity, thus facilitating nanos mRNA deadenylation and normal
anteroposterior embryonic patterning in Drosophila (Rouget et al.,
2010). Recently, Gou et al.(2014) reported that more than 7000
mRNAs were associated with Miwi, of which approximately 60%
experienced destabilization by Miwi in the elongating spermatids of
mouse. Together with mRNAs that are involved in piRNA—mediated
cleavage, a catalog of nearly ten thousand protein—coding genes are
potentially mediated by piRNAs, suggesting a prosperous role of

piRNAs in gene expression regulation. Conclusively, piRNAs have
mechanisms that act to repress protein-coding gene expression simi—
lar to miRNAs, either causing the cleavage of the target or the deg—
radation of the target. Both the miRNA pathway and the piRNA
pathway require recognition based on base—pairing and the partici—
pation of proteins from the Argonaute protein family. However, be—
cause piRNAs are restricted to expression in germ cells, piRNA—
mediated regulation might take place primarily during
spermatogenesis.

5Condu§on

It has been well accepted for a long period of time that the emer—
gence of piRNAs plays a role in genome defense by silencing TEs;
however, many recent studies have shown that piRNA—guided
silencing mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of non—
transposon transcripts. The first example of a piRNA targeting
mRNA was described in the Drosophila embryo (Rouget et al.,
2010). A similar phenomenon was also observed in C. elegans,
mouse and silkworm (Kiuchi et al., 2014), suggesting that piRNAs
could regulate gene expression via a mechanism similar to that of
miRNAs. Although there have been many published programs
aimed at predicting miRNA targets as well as public databases
curating experimentally verified or computational predicted targets
of miRNAs, there have been no studies assessing how many protein—
coding genes might be regulated by piRNAs. In our study, piRNA
targets on mRNAs were systematically identified at the genome—
wide level using an SVM classifier. The classifier was trained based
on the incorporation of Miwi CLIP—Seq—derived features and pos—
ition—derived features and achieved an area of the ROC curve of

Computational identiﬁcation of piRNA targets

87.25% at the site level and 75.55% at the gene level. Of all of the
features that were used, Miwi CLIP—Seq—derived features play a
dominate role in the piRNA enrichment of the 5’ end 10 nt down—
stream of the target site occupying the top ranked position. Of the
position—derived features, the genomic annotation is highly ranked,
with 3’UTR as a preferred choice, and nucleotide usage on the first
and tenth positions downstream of the target site is the next highest
ranked. Genome—wide prediction based on the trained classifier re—
sulted in 3781 mRNAs of 25 87 protein—coding genes as piRNA tar—
gets. These genes show significant upregulation as a whole after the
slicer activity of Miwi was abolished, suggesting that the predicted
list of piRNA targets is reliable. This work might provide valuable
clues for biologists who are interested in the function of piRNAs in
protein—coding genes. More details of the prediction results in this
study and the online version of the method called pirnaPre are avail—
able at http://www.regulatoryrna.org/software/piRNA/piRNA_tar

The default scoring function in PIUS is derived from the one used in
SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994). Although SEQUEST only considers ion
series I; and y, PIUS considers the ion series I), b*, ho, a, a*, a0, y, y*
and y“. We assign a weight to each ion series to give more importance to
abundant ions. To deﬁne the weights, we measured the relative frequency
of each ion series in a distinct dataset used only for this purpose and for
which the correct identiﬁcations were known. The user can reuse our
weights or deﬁne his own.

Our search strategy does not consider sequences originating through
splicing, neither does it account for polymorphism. We discuss possible
strategies to handle these challenges in Section 3.5 of the Supplementary
Material.

3 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

We evaluated PIUS on a subset of 109 spectra from a combined set
of peptide mass spectra from different mouse tissue and cell line
samples produced by MALDI—TOF—TOF (IWT—50164, 200&
2010; Van Dijck et al., 2011). The subset was obtained as follows.
We used a combination of two search algorithms (XlTandem and
OMSSA) within SearchGui to obtain the peptide identiﬁcation,
allowing for the following PTMs: N—term acetylation, C—term ami—
dation, oxidation on M and pyroglutamination on N—term Q. We
analyzed the results with Peptide—Shaker and retained only those
with a conﬁdence level of 100%, allowing us to use them as a gold
standard. Among the 109 spectra, six have a PTM. We compared
our results with those of MS—GappedDictionary.

We used PIUS with an error tolerance of 0.5 kDa for both
peptide and fragment mass, which is large enough to account
for measurement errors in MALDI—TOF—TOF data. We arbi—
trarily set k = 10,000 and a = 0.8. When searching for unmodi—
ﬁed translations, of the 103 unmodiﬁed spectra, PIUS returned
the gold standard solution (i) as the top 1 for 85 cases, (ii) as top
2 for 3 cases, (iii) in the top 10 of solutions for 8 cases, (iv) in a
lower ranking position for 7 cases. These results show that PIUS
is often able to reproduce deﬁnite identifications by XlTandem/
OMSSA, even though it searches a much larger space.

We also tested PIUS considering the same PTMs used to
deﬁne the gold standard solutions, allowing one PTM per can—
didate. For the spectra with PTMs, PIUS found the gold stand—
ard solution as (i) the top 1 for ﬁve cases and (ii) as the top 3 for
one case. For the spectra without PTMs, PIUS found the gold
standard solution (i) as the top 1 for 82 cases, (ii) as top 2 for 5
cases, (iii) in top 10 of solutions for 5 cases and (iv) in a lower
ranking position for 10 cases. For one case, PIUS pruned the
gold standard solution away. These results show that PIUS has a
high recall rate even when PTMs are considered.

We conﬁgured MS—GappedDictionary as recommended by its
authors: the charge range was set to 1, no enzymatic cleavage
was specified and all other parameters were left at their default
values. Note that this tool does not consider PTMs in the search.
Of the 103 unmodiﬁed spectra, MS—GappedDictionary found the
gold standard solution as (i) the top 1 for 48 cases and as (ii) the
top 2 for 2 cases. There were no hits for three cases and the gold
standard solution was not among the returned hits for 50 cases.
We also tested MS—GappedDictionary with the error tolerance
used by PIUS (0.5 kDa). With this lower tolerance, the gold
standard solution was (i) the top 1 for 57 cases, (ii) the top 2
for 2 cases and (iii) in the top 10 of solutions for 1 case. There
were no hits for 3 cases, and the gold standard solution was not

among the returned hits for 40 cases. This contrasts sharply with
the good results reported by Jeong et a]. (2010). A possible ex—
planation for this inferior performance is the source of the mass
spectra; J eong et a]. (2010) use other instruments that are gener—
ally more accurate than MALDI—TOF—TOF.

The current C implementation of PIUS has a throughput of
two spectra per hour on an Intel Core i7—2600 when searching the
21 mouse chromosomes, using a = 0.8. In case of large—scale
experiments, we recommend to use PIUS in a layered peptido—
mics workﬂow (Menschaert et al., 2010b). The workﬂow ﬁrst
searches databases in a conventional manner, and then calls on
PIUS for the remaining unidentiﬁed (but high quality) spectra.
In case this step would become a bottleneck, the algorithm can
easily be distributed.

4 CONCLUSION

Many spectra of candidate bioactive peptides remain unidenti—
fied to date. To tackle this problem we present PIUS, an open
source tool for peptide identiﬁcation from tandem mass
spectrometry data. PIUS searches the entire genome without
previous assumptions to reduce the search space and is, there—
fore, most suited as a tool of last resort. We have validated PIUS
with MALDI—TOF—TOF spectra. Even when searching an entire
mammalian genome, PIUS obtains correct identiﬁcations in a
large majority of cases and has a much higher recall rate than
MS—GappedDictionary.

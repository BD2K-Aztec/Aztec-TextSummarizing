Abstract

Summary: The development of the Infinium HumanMethyIation450 BeadChip enables epigenome—
wide association studies at a reduced cost. One observation of the 450K data is that many CpG
sites the beadchip interrogates have very large measurement errors. Including these noisy Cst
will decrease the statistical power of detecting relevant associations due to multiple testing correc—
tion. We propose to use intra—class correlation coefficient (ICC), which characterizes the relative
contribution of the biological variability to the total variability, to filter Cst when technical repli—
cates are available. We estimate the ICC based on a linear mixed effects model by pooling all the
samples instead of using the technical replicates only. An ultra—fast algorithm has been developed
to address the computational complexity and CpG filtering can be completed in minutes on a
desktop computer for a 450K data set of over 1000 samples. Our method is very flexible and can ac—
commodate any replicate design. Simulations and a real data application demonstrate that our
whole—sample ICC method performs better than replicate—sample ICC or variance—based method.
Availability and implementation: CpGFilter is implemented in R and publicly available under
CRAN via the R package 'CpGFilter’.

1 IntrOducuon determinants of human disease (Rakyan et (11., 2011). The Illumina

Recent advances in genomic technologies have enabled researchers to Infinium HumanMethyIation450 Beadchip, which interrogates the
conduct large—scale studies of human disease—associated epigenetic vari— methylation level of more than 450K CpG sites throughout the human
ation, specifically variation in DNA methylation. Such epigenome—vvide genome, has been increasingly popular in large—scale EWAS due to its
association studies (EWAS) have helped elucidate the non—genetic good genome coverage, high reproducibility and lower cost (Sandoval

et (11., 2011). One observation of the 450K data is that many Cst have
relatively larger technical variability compared with their biological vari—
ability, which are results of either large absolute technical variability (the
methylation level cannot be measured accurately) or lower biological
variability (many Cst are constitutiver methylated or unmethylated).
These Cst are less informative and including these Cst will reduce
the statistical power to discover relevant CpG sites by unnecessarily
increasing the number of statistical tests. Hence, CpG filtering could po—
tentially boost statistical power for underpowered studies. Traditional
variance—based CpG filter is based on the total variability, which is the
sum of the biological variability (signal) and technical variability (noise).
However, we are more interested in retaining Cst with relatively large
biological variability instead of total variability. As with any hybridiza—
tion—based array technology, CpG probes differ in their technical vari—
ability, possibly due to inexact probe sequence match, cross—
hybridization and local secondary structures (Price et (11., 2013).
Therefore, large total variability does not necessarily reﬂect large biolo—
gical variability. Without technical replicates, the assessment of technical
variability is difficult and we can only rely on the total variability to filter
Cst. Fortunately, most EWAS have included some technical replicates
to assess various sources of batch effects. We can therefore use these rep—
licates to assess technical variability. We propose to use intra—class correl—
ation coefficient (ICC), which is defined as the ratio of biological
variability to total variability, to filter CpG probes (Donner et (11., 1980).
We extend technical replicate—based method by Meng et al. (2010) and
Bose et al. (2014) and estimate ICC using a linear mixed effects model
(LMM) by pooling all samples including the unreplicated ones.
Compared with the method using technical replicates only, our method
can result in more efficient ICC estimate since the unreplicated samples
provide significant amount of information about the biological variabil—
ity. Our method can accommodate any type of replicate design including
unbalanced design. We have implemented an ultra—fast algorithm to fit
LMM in linear computational time and the algorithm is highly scalable.

2 Model

Suppose we have m independent biological samples measuring
the methylation of p Cst. Assume each biological sample repli—
cates 71,-(1' : 1, . . . ,m) times, totaling 71 :  71,- samples. Note in
most studies, the majority of the samples are not replicated and the
majority of n,- : 1. Before ICC estimation, we recommend that data
normalization and batch correction be performed to remove system—
atic technical variability. Denote 31,-,- as the methylation M—value of a
given CpG for 1th biological sample and its jth technical replicate.

We model 31,7 using an LMM
  

where an N N (0, a?) and 5,- N N (0, (7%) represent technical and bio—

logical variability respectively. Denote y,- : (31,1,  ,yim) and
T
Y : (y1,y2, ... ,ym) ,we then have
Y N 
with the mean ,u : (u, u, - - - , u)T and the covariance matrix V
A1 1 p m 9
A2 9 1 p
V28 a:
Am nxn p p "' 1 nixni,

where a2 : a? + (7% is the total variance and p :  + (7%) is the

ICC. When a? is the same for all Cst, the filtering procedure based
on the total variance is the same as that based on ICC. However, as
in all array—based technologies, different probes have different meas—
urement error levels, and ICC is generally a more appropriate meas—
ure than total variance. Fitting a mixed effects model with existing
general—purpose algorithms is computationally intensive and is not
scalable with the ever increasing sample size and CpG sites for gen—
ome—wide association studies. The major contribution of this paper
is therefore the development of an ultra—fast algorithm based on
maximum likelihood estimation, utilizing the special structure of the
covariance matrix (block—diagonality and compound symmetry
structure). The computational complexity is 0(np) and scalable
with the sample size and CpG number. The detailed algorithm is
included in the Supplementary Note S1.

3 Results

We compare our whole—sample ICC method to the replicate—sample
ICC method by Bose et al. (2014) as well as the total variance—based
method using simulations. We simulate 1000 Cst and 1000 inde—
pendent samples, among which 10 samples are replicated twice. Let
05 ~ Uniform(0.5, 8.0) and (76 ~ Uniform(0.25,2.0). We then simu—
late the methylation M—values based on the model (1) and rank these
Cst based on ICC or variance after applying the three alternatives.
We calculate the Spearman correlation between the resulted ranking
and the ranking based on the simulated true p’s, which is assumed
to be the best. Simulations are repeated 100 times. Figure 1A shows
our whole—sample ICC method produces invariably better ranking
than the other two methods (median correlation 0.80 vs. 0.70 and
0.58). We next study the effects of ICC—based CpG filtering on the
type I error and power of association tests using realistic simulations
(Supplementary Note S2). Cst with small ICCs will have no or lit—
tle chance of showing significance, and removing these Cst will
enrich signals against a background of noise. As expected, using
Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate control for multiple
comparison correction, the proposed method has achieved better
power than the replicate—sample ICC method, while controlling the
type I error at the desired level. Simulation also suggests at least six
technical replicate pairs to achieve good results.

We apply our method to a cleaned 450K dataset of 482 985
methylation sites from buffy coat leukocytes of 559 males and 10
technical replicate pairs from the Normative Aging Study (Marioni
et (11., 2015). We conduct an epigenome—wide cross—sectional ana—
lysis of age (median 72, range 55—100 years) based on a linear
model, adjusting for subject characteristics, estimated cell type pro—
portions and technical covariates. Strict Bonferroni correction is

used to select ‘significant’ CpG sites. Clearly, these sites are dramat—
ically enriched in large ICC values (Fig. 1B). We see that 96.7% of
the sites associated with age come from those with an ICC greater
than the median (0.55). We also see 138 562 sites with an estimated
ICC of zero, indicating much larger technical variability (measure—
ment error) compared with their biological variability. In compari—
son with the ICC method, if we had only used the sites with total
variance above the median, we would have captured only 93% of
the sites associated with age in the full analysis (Supplementary Fig.
S1). In general, an ICC cutoff of around 0.5 provides a good trade—
off between loss of potential significant CpG sites due to filtering
and gain of power due to reduction of multiple testing burden
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

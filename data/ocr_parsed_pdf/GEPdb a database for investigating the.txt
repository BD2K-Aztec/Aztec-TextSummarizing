ABSTRACT

Summary: GEde integrates both genome-wide association studies
and expression quantitative trait loci information, the two primary
sources of genome-wide mapping for genotype—phenotype and geno-
type—expression associations together with phenotype-associated
gene lists. The GEde provides simultaneous interpretation of both
genetic risks and potential gene regulatory pathways toward
phenotypic outcome by establishing the ternary relationship of geno-
type—expression—phenotype (GEP). The analytic scope is further
extended by linkage disequilibrium from five different populations of
the international HapMap Project.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quan-
titative trait loci (eQTL) are the principal methods for genome-
scale mapping of genotypeephenotype and genotypeeexpression
relationships, respectively. In most cases, GWAS provides little
information on the underlying mechanism at the molecular and
cellular levels. A recent survey showed that 5~16% of the
GWAS hits fall into coding regions (Schaub et al., 2012) allowing
direct interpretation of protein structural and functional impacts.
The majority of hit single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may
have some regulatory function through transcriptional regula-
tion, miRNA targeting or epigenetic changes. Therefore, if
there are common SNPs shared by both GWAS and eQTL,
the eQTL genes are good candidates for the underlying patho-
logical process and its phenotypic outcome (Cookson et al.,
2009).

Many dedicated databases have been developed for either
GWAS (Hindorff et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012; Thorisson et al.,
2009) or eQTL (Lonsdale et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2012; Yang
et al., 2010). There are few integrated databases for both
GWAS and eQTL data that (i) support a mechanistic interpret-
ation of GWAS results, and (ii) infer causal genetic variations

responsible for differential expression of disease signature genes
Via eQTL mapping. We developed GEde that seamlessly
integrates a comprehensive collection of GWAS, eQTL and
phenotype-associated gene lists. Such integration provides a
novel opportunity to analyze the ternary relationship of
genotypewxpressionephenotype (GEP) in a genome scale.
The hit SNPs (tagging SNPs) may belong to a haplotype
block, whereas their neighboring SNPs may be actually
functional in both GWAS and eQTL mapping by linkage
disequilibrium (LD). GEde supports expansion of SNPs
using LD information.

2 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING

We compiled and processed datasets for (i) >47 million SNPs,
(ii) >1300 GWAS, (iii) ~0.8 million eQTLs and (iv) >17 million
eQTL SNP-gene pairs, as well as ~12 000 phenotype-
associated gene signatures categorized by traits, disease subtypes
and tissue/cell types. The summary of the datasets is shown in
Table 1, and the detailed statistics are shown online at the GEde
Web site. The SNPs are categorized as gene, 5/ U TR, exon, intron,
3/ U TR and intergenic. Notably, all GWAS datasets and the pheno-
type-associated gene lists are classiﬁed by Trait, MeSH, Study,
FirstAuthor, Disease Class and/or tissue by a substantial manual
annotation and are organized into a hierarchical tree-like structure.

3 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

GEde integrates a comprehensive collection of GWAS (geno-
typeephenotype), eQTL (genotypewxpression) and phenotype-
associated gene signatures. The schematic overview is shown in
Figure 1. Using the GEde, a list of SNPs or genes can be
interpreted by associating the ternary relationships of GEP.
The input SNPs or genes are selected among the precompiled
datasets of GEde or can be directly entered by the user. The
analytical procedure is designed to be simple, linear and bidirec-
tional, i.e. G2E, G>E>P or P>E>G mode (Fig. 1). In the GE
mode, a list of SNPs and a gene set are entered as input, and then
the SNPs and genes are linked to each other Via the eQTL rela-
tionship. Alternatively, the user can select gene signature(s) for a
particular trait (or disease), and check whether they are linked to
the GWAS hit SNPs for the same or related phenotype Via eQTL
mapping. Any SNP set can be expanded using the LD informa-
tion among the five different populations of the International
Hapmap Project phases 17111. In the G>E>P mode, a list of

input SNPs are entered and linked to the downstream regulated
genes Via eQTL (G>E). Then, these genes are compared against
the precompiled gene sets related to various diseases and other
phenotypes (E>P). The summary result is displayed as table, in
which the statistical signiﬁcance of the overlap between gene or
SNP sets (P—Value and Q-Value) is calculated by the hypergeo-
metric distribution and the Bonferroni correction method. The
direction of analysis is reversed in the P>E>G mode. Starting
from a list of genes [e.g. typically, differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) for a disease: P>E] as input, their associated eQTL
SNPs are retrieved as potentially regulatory loci.

4 DISCUSSION

A critical question regarding the GEP ternary relationship
is to what extent the expression signatures (DEGs) can be

on the disease category and individual study. The median cover-
age was 0~100 and 2.3~100% by eQTL and LD + eQTL,
respectively, and some signature genes resulted in no outcome
(Fig. 2). The overall low coverage may, at least partially,
result from inaccurate mapping between GWAS and the
corresponding expression signatures because of disease subtypes
or heterogeneity. Nevertheless, a signiﬁcant fraction of
known gene signatures were traced back to their potential gen-
etic risks using GEde (GE mode). Similarly, any set of
gene signatures or candidate SNPs can also be analyzed
using the G>E>P or P>E>G modes to generate testable
hypotheses.

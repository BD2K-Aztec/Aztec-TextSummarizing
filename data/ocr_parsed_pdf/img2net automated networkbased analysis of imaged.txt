ABSTRACT

Summary: Automated analysis of imaged phenotypes enables fast
and reproducible quantiﬁcation of biologically relevant features.
Despite recent developments, recordings of complex networked
structures, such as leaf venation patterns, cytoskeletal structures or
traffic networks, remain challenging to analyze. Here we illustrate the
applicability of ingnet to automatedly analyze such structures by
reconstructing the underlying network, computing relevant network
properties and statistically comparing networks of different types or
under different conditions. The software can be readily used for ana-
lyzing image data of arbitrary 2D and 3D network-like structures.
Availability and Implementation: ingnet is open-source software
under the GPL and can be downloaded from http://mathbiolmpimp-
golm.mpg.deﬁngnet/, where supplementary information and data-
sets for testing are provided.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological and man-made systems, ranging from biochemical re-
actions to neural and social interactions, can often be represented
as networks, with nodes and edges representing the components
and their interactions, respectively. Network representations
facilitate not only intuitive Visualization but also quantitative
studies of the systems’ structure and dynamics.

Spatial networks constitute an import subclass, which includes
networks, such as leaf venation (Dodds et al., 2010), cellular
cytoskeleton (V olkmann et al., 1999) and city streets
(Barthélemy, 2011). While some of these networks, like city in-
frastructure, have been well-characterized, others, like biological
spatial networks, remain poorly understood.

Snapshots of spatial networks can be obtained by imaging
technologies. The computational challenge is that of extracting
the underlying networks from the gathered images in a fast and
reliable fashion, and of examining the reconstructions to reveal
the underlying organizational principles.

The existing image-based methods for reconstruction of
biological networks are typically designed for speciﬁc types of
networks: tree-like networks for plant root architectures (Pound
et al., 2013); fungal or leaf venation networks (Obara et al.,
2012); or neuronal topology of the human connectome

(Longair et al., 2011; Meijering, 2010). While most of these
approaches require user input, rendering them unfeasible
for high-throughput studies, fully automated algorithms are usu-
ally tailored to speciﬁc image sources and challenged by low
signal-to-noise ratios, which may strongly affect the resulting
networks.

Here, we present a robust approach to reconstruct 2D and 3D
(non-)biological spatial networks from gray-scale image data. By
constructing weighted networks and computing their seminal
network properties, img2net allows an extensive quantiﬁcation
and statistical comparison of network topologies.

2 METHODS AND FUNCTIONALITY

We extract the networks from image data in two steps: starting
from a gray-scale image, where high intensities reﬂect strong
links in the network, we place a (arbitrary) grid, which covers
the region of interest. For each grid-edge, we determine a weight
by convolving a Gaussian kernel with the original image to
capture the edge’s capacities to carry certain trafﬁc, the speed
of transportation or combinations thereof (cf. Results).

To facilitate comparative analyses, different seminal properties
of the resulting weighted network are computed, including
degree distribution, path lengths or random-walk-related proper-
ties. To evaluate the biological importance of the calculated
properties, we developed several null models, which randomize
the network while preserving the distribution of edge weights.
They provide the basis for revealing the principles underlying
the network organization (Breuer et al., 2014).

img2net is written in Python and provides a graphical user
interface (GUI; Fig. 1A) for the selection of the image input
data and the parameters of the network reconstruction proced-
ure. It operates on folders of .png, .jpg, or .tiff ﬁles that display
the networked structure of interest, with a gray-scale representa-
tion of edge strengths. The directory tree divides the images into
different treatments and experiments, e. g.

root / treatment_003 / experiment_005 / ima ge_2001 _t00 1 .tif f

The usage of rectangular, triangular or hexagonal grids is
supported; grid spacings, periodic boundary conditions, the
widths of the convolution kernel and the number of layers for
3D image data can be specified by the user. Different null models
are available and the number of null model realizations can be
set. Finally, img2net can be run on multiple cores.

An output folder is generated in the root directory of the
chosen image directory tree: a human-readable document is

standard plots as .svg ﬁles: for each experiment, a reconstructed
network overlaying the original image data is saved. For all
analyzed network properties, plots of the resulting time series
are generated to facilitate network comparisons.

3 RESULTS

For testing, img2net was used to compare confocal recordings of
the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 1B and C) of untreated plant cells
and cells treated with an actin disrupting drug (Breuer et al.,
2014). We ﬁnd that the actin networks of treated cells display
a consistently lower assortativity (Fig. 1D), indicating a drug-
related filament fragmentation. Further, for untreated cells, the
observed networks display signiﬁcantly smaller average path
lengths (‘accessibility’) and signiﬁcantly higher algebraic connec-
tivities (‘robustness’) than expected by chance (P—Values
estimated from the null model Via one-sample t-tests; Fig. 1E),
suggesting a biological basis for the maintenance of short and
robust transportation routes.

We also used img2net to analyze the network structure of the
German autobahn, which was obtained from OpenStreetMap as
an image by using a gray-scale coding of the speed limits (Breuer
et al., 2014). We find that, similar to the actin cytoskeleton, the

 

autobahn shows signiﬁcantly smaller path lengths and a higher
algebraic connectivity than expected by chance.

4 CONCLUSION

Because networks provide an intuitively accessible as well as
mathematically sound framework for the representation of com-
plex systems, the reconstruction of spatial networks from image
data is useful in biological and technical research. img2net im-
plements an automated method for fast and robust reconstruc-
tion of arbitrary 2D and 3D (non-)biological spatial networks.

As our approach relies on ﬁxed grid topologies, img2net offers
different types of grids to verify that the ﬁndings are grid-
independent. For small grid spacings, the grid typically
approaches the ‘true’ structure of the underlying network. The
main benefit of this approach is its robustness against noise and
flaws in the input images. For example, small ruptures in the
underlying network do not disrupt the corresponding edges but
only weaken them. Hence, our approach does not require sophis-
ticated error-correcting image processing steps. Furthermore,
img2net is directly applicable to a wide range of image data
from different sources.

The analyses of the reconstructed networks implemented in
img2net allow a quantiﬁcation of structural properties, compari-
sons of networks, e. g. under different conditions, and an assess-
ment whether the network properties reﬂect underlying
organizational principles.

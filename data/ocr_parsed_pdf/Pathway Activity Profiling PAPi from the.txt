ABSTRACT

Motivation: Metabolomics is one of the most recent omics-
technologies and uses robust analytical techniques to screen low
molecular mass metabolites in biological samples. It has evolved
very quickly during the last decade. However, metabolomics datasets
are considered highly complex when used to relate metabolite
levels to metabolic pathway activity. Despite recent developments
in bioinformatics, which have improved the quality of metabolomics
data, there is still no straightforward method capable of correlating
metabolite level to the activity of different metabolic pathways
operating within the cells. Thus, this kind of analysis still depends
on extremely laborious and time-consuming processes.

Results: Here, we present a new algorithm Pathway Activity Profiling
(PAPi) with which we are able to compare metabolic pathway
activities from metabolite profiles. The applicability and potential
of PAPi was demonstrated using a previously published data from
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PAPi was able to support the
biological interpretations of the previously published observations
and, in addition, generated new hypotheses in a straightforward
manner. However, PAPi is time consuming to perform manually.
Thus, we also present here a new R-software package (PAPi)
which implements the PAPi algorithm and facilitates its usage to
quickly compare metabolic pathways activities between different
experimental conditions. Using the identified metabolites and their
respective abundances as input, the PAPi package calculates
pathways’ Activity Scores, which represents the potential metabolic
pathways activities and allows their comparison between conditions.
PAPi also performs principal components analysis and analysis of
variance or t-test to investigate differences in activity level between
experimental conditions. In addition, PAPi generates comparative
graphs highlighting up- and down-regulated pathway activity.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolomics is one of the newest omics technologies and has
been evolving rapidly during recent years. Combined with robust
analytical methods, metabolomics is capable of screening large
numbers of low molecular mass metabolites in biological samples.
Metabolites are intermediates of biochemical reactions and are
essential in linking different pathways within a biological system.
However, metabolites are synthesized and modiﬁed by enzymes
that are products of gene transcription. Thus, metabolite level is
determined by a complex network of reactions in which many
regulatory processes involving metabolites, enzymes, mRNAs and
genes play an important part. For this reason, metabolomics has been
considered essential for the validation of datasets generated by other
omics technologies (Cakir et (11., 2006) and has been largely applied
as a functional genomics tool and as part of systems biology studies
(Andersen and Nielsen, 2009; Nielsen and Oliver, 2005; Oliver et al.,
1998; Villas-Boas et a1, 2004, 2005b, 2008).

However, the convoluted nature of cell metabolism, where the
same metabolite can participate in many different pathways, makes
the pathway activity analysis, in particular, the most difﬁcult
‘omics-data’ to interpret (Villas-Boas et al., 2005a). In addition, as
with any other post-genomic technology, metabolomics generates
large datasets requiring sophisticated bioinformatics tools for their
processing and analysis (Kopka et (11., 2005).

Despite the analytical aspects of metabolomics (e.g. quenching
of metabolism, metabolite extraction and data acquisition) being
well advanced (Dunn, 2008), the correlation between metabolite
level and metabolic pathway activity is still considered a complex
task to achieve. Consequently, the biological interpretation of
metabolomics data remains major bottlenecks in metabolome
analysis (Cakir et (11., 2006). As a result, to assist with post-
genomic data analysis of cell metabolism, a great number of
proprietary and open source software packages have been developed
during the last 10 years by different companies (e.g. AnalyzerPro®
for GC-MS and LC-MS data mining by SpectralWorks Ltd;
MarkerViewTM for metabolomics and protein/peptide biomarker
proﬁling by Applied Biosystems; Mass Proﬁler Professional
by Agilent Technology) and institutions (e.g. Bioconductor). In
addition, many web-based databases are now available and provide
important information regarding metabolite diversity, metabolic
pathways, biochemical reactions, enzymes and genes (Kopka et (11.,
2005). Among these, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes
(KEGG) is one of the most popular databases and it is freely
available through http://www.genome.jp/kegg/. In addition, KEGG
has application programming interfaces (API) that allow its use
by external software. Consequently, several computational tools

Fig. 1. Description of PAPi algorithm. Starting from a metabolomics dataset (initial data frame), PAPi searchs the KEGG database for potential active
metabolic pathways, caculates their AS for different samples and combines the results in a unique frame work. (A) All pathways for which each metabolite is
known to play a part are collected from the KEGG database. (B) Each identiﬁed pathway then receives a score based on the abundance/relative abundance of
the metabolite to which it is linked. (C) The total number of metabolites associated with each pathway is recorded and the pathways are then ranked according
to the number of metabolites with which they are associated. The percentage of detected metabolic intermediates is then calculated for each listed pathway.

have been created to automatically access, extract and manipulate
the information contained in these databases (http://www.genome
.jp/kegg/soap/; Arita, 2004). R (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996),
an open-source software environment developed for statistical
computing (www.r-project.org), is among those with hundreds of
available packages developed for different purposes, in particular
‘KEGGSOAP’ (Zhang and Gentleman, 2009), ‘KEGG.db’ (Carlson
et al., 2009) and ‘Keggorth’ (Carey, 2008) which enable access to
and, therefore, use of data from the KEGG database in a ﬂexible way.

These signiﬁcant advances in bioinformatics tools have improved
the quality of both the data generated by omics studies and
the subsequent biological interpretations. However, when relating
metabolite level to pathway activity, there are only few tools
available [e.g. MetPA, Pathway Hunter Tool, Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Metabolite Set
Enrichment Analysis (MSEA)] and most of them require extensive
data pro-processing and demand great knowledge about cellular
metabolisms, which increases the time-spent and decreases the
accessibility to the biological interpretation.

Here, we present a new algorithm Pathway Activity Proﬁling
(PAPi) that, using the metabolite proﬁle and KEGG database,
compares the activity of metabolic pathways between different
experimental conditions. For this, we deﬁned a new measure for
pathway activity, which we called Activity Score (AS). Calculated
for each pathway, the AS is based on the number of metabolites
identiﬁed from each pathway and their relative abundances. As a
result, the AS represents the likelihood that a metabolic pathway is
active inside the cell and, consequently, allows the comparison of
metabolic pathway activities.

However, PAPi is considered time consuming if performed
manually. Thus, we developed an R package, PAPi, which
implements our new algorithm and facilitates its usage. PAPi uses
the data extracted from metabolomics experiments together with the
KEGG database to generate relative ASS. PAPi includes ﬁinctions
to perform principal component analysis (PCA) and either a t-
test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the ASS and to generate
graphical summaries of the results. The functions also enable the
use of (optional) pop-up dialog boxes making them more accessible
to new R users.

2 THE ALGORITHM

2.1 Input data

The starting point of PAPi is a data frame containing the KEGG
code of the identiﬁed metabolites in the ﬁrst column and their
abundances/relative abundances in each sample in the subsequent
columns (Supplementary Fig. l). The KEGG compound code can
be found at the KEGG website (http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/
www_bﬁnd?compound). We assume that data have been normalized
(e.g. normalization by internal standard or uncultured medium)
and that the data have been appropriately transformed (e.g. log
transformation) before being submitted to PAPi.

2.2 Description

To facilitate the algorithm’s description, we have divided it into
six steps shown in Figure 1. In the ﬁrst step, the KEGG database
is accessed and the pathway(s) associated with each metabolite

PAPi

 

are returned. That is, all pathways for which each metabolite is
known to play a part are collected from the KEGG database
(Fig. 1A). Each identiﬁed pathway then receives a score based on the
abundance/relative abundance of the metabolite to which it is linked
(Fig. 1B). The total number of metabolites associated with each
pathway is recorded and the pathways are then ranked according
to the number of metabolites with which they are associated.
The percentage of detected metabolic intermediates is then
calculated for each listed pathway (Fig. 1C). Finally, we sum over
the scores for each pathway to obtain the total pathway score,
SA, (Fig. 1D) and normalize it by dividing by the proportion of
metabolites detected from itS respective pathway (Fig. 1E). The
normalized score of each pathway represents the level of itS activity
inside the cell, where the higher the score the lower the activity.
Thus, we deﬁne the normalized AS for pathway P as

SA (P)=(r1+r2+~-~+rN)N/k,

where

rl- = the relative abundance of metabolite i detected from pathway P,

N = the number of metabolites detected in pathway P, and

k = the total number of metabolites known to play a part in
pathway P.

The six operations described above are applied for all samples
from each condition studied. Afterwards, the outcome is combined
in a ﬁnal data frame containing the list of all active pathways and
their respective normalized scores for each sample. When applied
to the analysis of extracellular metabolites (metabolic footprinting),
the proﬁle of metabolites should be normalized (subtracted) by
the uncultured medium (control sample) before analysis by PAPi.
In our example, a two-sample t-teSt was used to assess pathway
differential activity between two conditions, and only those that were
statistically signiﬁcant were retained (Fig. 1G). Note that when three
or more conditions are being investigated ANOVA can be applied
to teSt the global hypothesis of a difference between conditions,
and then pair-wise comparisons of conditions can be performed for
those pathways for which a statistical difference in activity between
conditions was declared. Finally, a graph showing all metabolic
pathways and their respective normalized scores in both conditions
can be generated to represent the data and assist the interpretation
(Fig. 2).

If we Simply plot the pathways ASS, the resultant graph would
be somewhat counterintuitive because AS iS inversely related to
the predicted pathway activity, i.e. the higher the AS, the lower the
predicted pathway activity. ThuS, before plotting, we suggest scaling
and ‘inverting’ the pathway ASS. Scaling iS performed by setting the
AS of one of the conditions to 0, referring to thiS aS the reference
condition, and then scaling the AS of the other condition relative to
the reference, referring to the latter aS the target condition. We then
‘invert’ each pathway’S AS before plotting, i.e.

SI’LReference (P) = 0
and
1A (P) =

I _ _ I I - I I
SA,Target _ (SA,Target/SA,Reference) 1f SA,Target > SA,Reference
I _ I I - I I ‘
SA,Target _ (SA,Reference/SA,Target) 1f SA,Target < SA,Reference

For example, if the ASS of the reference and target in pathway P are
S A’Reference (P) = 3 and S AﬁTarget (P) :6, respectively, their scaled
scores will be 0 (Reference) and —2 (Target).

While scaling and inverting of pathway ASS iS not essential,
we recommend their use because they facilitate a more intuitive
visualization of the data.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Our methodology iS based on two main assumptions. We postulate
that (i) if a given metabolic pathway iS more active in a given
condition, a larger number of metabolic intermediates from that
pathway iS likely to be detected by metabolomics. However, Since
the same metabolites are usually detected across different conditions,
we assume that (ii) the greater the activity of a metabolic pathway,
the lower the abundance of the metabolic intermediates from that
pathway, because the metabolic ﬂux throughout the pathway iS
expected to be higher. Higher metabolic ﬂux Should result in
higher conversion rateS of metabolic intermediates inSide the cellS,
reﬂecting in lower abundances of metabolites produced by that
pathway. However, considering that a metabolic pathway presenting
lower ﬂux might result in the accumulation of Speciﬁc intermediates
due to lower intracellular conversion rateS, the predicted activity
of that pathway can be miSled by the higher abundances of a few
metabolites. Therefore, to minimize thiS effect, we normalize the
pathway ASS by the percentage (%) of metabolites detected from
each pathway, because it iS assumed (ﬁrSt assumption) that we
will detect a higher proportion of metabolic intermediates from a
highly active pathway than from pathways of low activity. However,
most metabolomics data are based on relative quantiﬁcation and
each metabolite iS subject to different response factorS depending
on the analytical techniques being used. Therefore, unleSS absolute
quantiﬁcation data iS available, PAPi results obtained from relative
quantiﬁcation based metabolomics data can only be used to compare
metabolic pathway activity between different data classes. In other
wordS, PAPi results can only be used to predict that pathway A iS
more active in condition/sample ClaSS I than in condition/sample
ClaSS II, but not that pathway A iS more active than pathway B. In
order to predict that pathway A iS more or leSS active than pathway B,
absolute quantiﬁcation data iS required.

Considering the assumptions above, PAPi results in a data frame
containing the identiﬁed pathways and their respective ASS for each
sample. However, thiS method usually detects over 100 pathways aS
being potentially active in a cell based on a dataset containing around
50 different identiﬁed metabolites and many of these pathways
are equally active between different conditions. ThuS, Statistical
analyses are carried out on the ASS to identify pathways that are
differentially active between pairs of conditions. A two-sample t-teSt
iS performed when only two conditions are being Studied, otherwise
ANOVA can be performed. The ﬁnal output of the analySiS iS a
data frame containing the pathways most likely to be deﬁning the
differences between data classes and thiS data frame can be plotted
in a line graph.

PAPi also generates unique observations when used to
analyze metabolic footprinting data (extracellular metabolites from
microbial or cell cultures). For thiS type of data, we subtract
the abundance of metabolites in the uncultured medium from the
abundance of metabolites detected in the Spent culture medium
before applying PAPi (Aggio et (11., 2010). ThiS way, some

PAPi

 

Although the assumptions used to build PAPi suit most of
the metabolic pathways, the Glycolysis pathway seems to work
in a distinct way. According to Stephanopoulous and co-workers
(Stephanopoulous et a1. 1998), even when glycolysis is in a high ﬂux
state we should expect high abundance of its intermediates, which is
pretty reasonable if we consider that Glycolysis is a central metabolic
pathway that provides precursors for many essential pathways (e.g.
TCA cycle). Thus, we agree that for glycolysis PAPi may not be
accurate, but it is still useful in detecting whether glycolysis is
operating at different ﬂuxes between experimental conditions.

In addition, it is important to emphasize that by using the non-
species-speciﬁc KEGG database information we usually observe
that pathways not naturally belonging to the organism under study
may appear as potentially active by PAPi. This output sounds wrong
in principle, but we speculate that it can actually provide important
information about possible metabolic interactions between different
organisms or species and also about novel metabolic reactions. For
instance, extracellular metabolites produced by an organism A can
simultaneously play a role in the metabolism of an organism B,
which can be a potential metabolic link that allows the interaction
between these two organisms. In addition, when a pathway appears
as being active it does not mean that the whole pathway is active,
but rather speciﬁc reactions of that pathway are taking place.

Metabolic pathway activity is directly related to metabolic ﬂux
distribution. Thus, pathways presenting lower scores based on
intracellular metabolomics data are likely to be operating at high
metabolic ﬂux. Thereby, our method not only reduces the time spent
on metabolomics data analysis but it may also enable us to compare
the metabolic ﬂux of different pathways in different conditions
(indirect ﬂuxomics).

3.1 Method validation

To illustrate and validate the use of PAPi, we analyzed a set of
yeast metabolomics data published previously by Villas-Boas et al.
(2005a) and reanalyzed by Cakir et al. (2006).

3.1.1 Villas-Boas et al. (2005a) The metabolomics data
published by Villas-Boas et al. (2005a) consists of intracellular
and extracellular metabolite data of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae
strains: a wild-type laboratorial strain (CEN.PK.ll3-7D) and
a mutant strain (CEN.MSl-lOCTl). The mutant was a redox-
engineered strain with a deleted NADPH-dependent glutamate
dehydrogenase (encoded by GDHI) and an over expressed NADH
dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (encoded by GDHZ). The
enzyme encoded by GDHl is considered the major enzyme
responsible for nitrogen assimilation during S.cerevisiae growth on
ammonium as sole nitrogen source, and accounts for a considerable
fraction of the NADPH consumed in the cell (Villas-Béas et al.,
2005a). Both strains were grown in batch cultures under aerobic
and anaerobic conditions using standard minimal mineral medium
with glucose as the sole carbon source and ammonium (NHI) as
the sole nitrogen source. Due to excellent culture reproducibility,
the sample-to-sample variability exceeded ﬂask-to-ﬂask variability;
consequently, replicate samples from different shake ﬂasks were
treated equivalently. The metabolome dataset analyzed included
15 intracellular and 9 extracellular sample replicates for each
experimental condition tested (data classes). In order to deconvolute
the peaks of GC-MS spectra and identify the metabolites, we
followed the protocol published previously in Aggio et al., 2010.

Although the comparison between the wild-type and the mutant
strains revealed no differences in growth rates under aerobic (dos
Santos et al., 2003) and anaerobic (Nissen et al., 2000) batch
cultivations, PAPi was able to detect the differences between
pathway activities due to the differences in the metabolite proﬁle and
metabolite abundances obtained by Villas-Boas et al. (2005a). Thus,
in order to validate PAPi ﬁndings, we compared the pathway proﬁle
activity of both strains under the two environmental conditions
(aerobic and anaerobic) and correlated the results with observations
reported in Villas-Boas et al. (2005a) and Cakir et a1. (2006) ﬁndings.

3.1.2 PAPi results aerobic versus anaerobic cultures: as
discussed by Cakir et a1. (2006), it is expected to ﬁnd some common
effects between the genetic and environmental perturbations. The
genetic perturbation (knockout of GDHI gene and over expression
of GDHZ) has direct effect on the overall cell balance of
NADPH/NADP+ and NADH/NADT; consequently, the mutation
directly affects the cell redox metabolism. On the other hand, the
oxygen availability also affects the redox metabolism due to changes
in the operation of the TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP). Indeed, Cakir et a1. (2006) detected reactions commonly
changed in both datasets and, and in agreement, PAPi predicted a
great number (~70 %) of metabolic pathways commonly changed
in both pair-comparisons (aerobic/anaerobic and wild type/mutant)
(Supplementary Table 1).

Furthermore, Villas-Boas et al. (2005a) observed that samples
from anaerobic cultivations presented overall higher levels of
both intra and extracellular metabolites when compared to aerobic
cultivations. In agreement, PAPi also predicted that most metabolic
pathways were likely to be operating at lower activity under
anaerobic condition (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3), which results
in lower biomass biosynthesis and in intracellular accumulation of
metabolites, with consequent potential overﬂow to the extracellular
medium.

In addition, despite S.cerevisiae not presenting a homologous
gene sequence for lactate dehydrogenase, Villas-Boas et al. (2005a)
detected high levels of lactate under anaerobic condition for both
intra and extracellular samples. High levels of glyoxylate were also
detected under anaerobic condition and were subsequently shown
to be formed from a novel pathway for glyoxylate biosynthesis in
S.cerevisiae involving direct deamination of glycine (Villas-Béas
et al., 2005b). The results from PAPi (Supplementary Figures 2
and 3) Show a signiﬁcantly lower activity of the TCA cycle
metabolism (TCA), pyruvate metabolism (PM) and glycine, serine
and threonine metabolism (GSTM) under anaerobic condition.
Martins et a1. (2001) reported that S.cerevisiae can synthesize
D-lactate via methylglyoxal metabolism that intrinsically linked
to PM. Interestingly; methylglyoxal is also a key precursor for
the GSTM, which could potentially increase the biosynthesis of
glycine. Therefore, we speculate that the methylglyoxal could have
been acting as a link between PM and GSTM, where lactate and
glyoxylate were the main metabolic products resultant from these
pathways. In other words, the predicted low ﬂux in the TCA
cycle under anaerobic condition (Cakir et al., 2006) resulted in the
accumulation of intermediates from PM and consequently increased
formation of methylglyoxal. The higher amount of methylglyoxal
available in the cell could have increased the formation of D-lactate
and also increased the biosynthesis of glycine through GSTM.
However, due to reduced incorporation of amino acids into biomass

 

2973

9103 ‘1g1sn8nv 110::

R.B.M.Aggio et al.

 

under anaerobic growth, GSTM ﬂux may have been repressed.
Thus, the accumulated levels of free amino acids from GSTM
such as glycine could have been preferentially converted to other
metabolites such as glyoxylate via glycine deaminase reaction that
does not seem to be repressed by glucose and is active under
both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Villas-Béas et al., 2005b)
(Supplementary Fig. 4).

Villas-Boas et al. (2005a) also observed the presence of myristic
acid in the extracellular samples of anaerobic cultures. In agreement,
PAPi predicted a lower activity of both fatty acid biosynthesis
(FAB) and fatty acid metabolism (FAM) pathways under anaerobic
conditions. Myristic acid is an intermediate metabolite of FAB and
is related to biomass formation, since it can react with glycerol to
form lipids required for the cellular membrane structure. Myristic
acid may have accumulated due to higher availability of precursors
for FAB in the central carbon metabolism (e.g. acetyl-CoA) and
the reduced requirement of lipids and fatty acids for biomass
biosynthesis. Therefore, an accumulation and potential overﬂow of
myristic acid into the extracellular medium is a potential result of
the low activity of FAB and FAM pathways predicted by PAPi due
to the lower biomass formation under anaerobic conditions.

3.1.3 Wild-type culture versus mutant culture. Villas-Boas et al.
(2005a) observed two distinct patterns in metabolite proﬁles between
wild-type and mutant strains. Aerobically, the mutant presented
higher levels of many metabolites while the opposite was observed
anaerobically. According to our assumptions, a lower pathway
activity means low inter-conversion rates of metabolites and
potential accumulation of some of its intermediates. On the other
hand, a high pathway activity means high inter-conversion rates of
metabolites and consequently less abundance of its intermediates.
AS a result, PAPi predicted lower activity for most pathways in the
mutant when grown under aerobic conditions and higher activity
was observed under anaerobiosis (Fig. 2).

AS discussed by Villas-Boas et al. (2005a) and Cakir et al. (2006),
due to the deletion of GDHI , the mutant strain is expected to present
difﬁculties in assimilating ammonium into glutamate, a key reaction
for nitrogen metabolism in the central carbon metabolism. Thus, low
intracellular levels of glutamate potentially decrease the activity of
pathways derived from glutamate, such as Pyrimidine metabolism
and Butanoate metabolism, which was indeed predicted by PAPi.

Cakir et a1. (2006) also detected a reduced difference in metabolic
activity between the mutant and wild type when grown under
anaerobic conditions. Accordingly, we observed considerably fewer
metabolic pathways presenting Signiﬁcant differences between wild-
type and mutant during anaerobic growth (Fig. 2). Thus, the PAPi
results also support these predictions made by Cakir et a1. (2006).

Higher intracellular levels of 2-oxoglutarate was found in
the mutant samples during aerobic growth (Villas-Béas et al.
2005a) and Cakir et a1. (2006) suggested that the activity of
alanine aspartate transaminase (AAT) that catalyzes the conversion
of oxalacetate to aspartate, could be potentially altered in the
mutant under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, PAPi predicted that
the reductive carboxylate cycle (RCC), a pathway intrinsically
connected to Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism through
oxalacetate and by the reaction converting pyruvate in L-alanine,
was less active in the mutant during aerobic growth (Fig. 2).
AS suggested by Cakir et a1. (2006), oxalacetate could have
been converted to aspartate. However, we argue that the high

level of 2-oxoglutarate and other intermediates of the RCC
pathway may favor the formation of pyruvate that can then be
converted to L-alanine by alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1).
Surprisingly, L-alanine dehydrogenase uses ammonium and NADH
as cofactor to convert pyruvate into alanine. Therefore, the deletion
of the GDHI and overexpression of GDHZ could have led
to an up-regulation of the reductive carboxylate cycle pathway
with alanine dehydrogenase acting as a secondary pathway for
assimilation of nitrogen from ammonium. Although there is Still no
description of alanine dehydrogenase in S.cerevisiae, this enzyme
is well-described for bacteria and for which it is known to be
Strongly related to nitrogen assimilation from ammonium. By
using the Blast algorithm through the Saccharomyces Genome
Database (www.yeastgenome.org) we detected a potential homology
sequence of 57% match between the Haemophilus parasuis alanine
dehydrogenase nucleotide sequence and the region YDR211W
(GCD6) of the S. cerevisiae, showing that S. cerevisiae could possibly
transcribe an enzyme with similar amino acid sequence. In addition,
Burk et a1. (2007) demonstrated that there is homology between
the saccharopine dehydrogenase of S.cerevisiae and the alanine
dehydrogenase present in the cyanobacteria Phormidium lapideum.
It is well known that saccharopine dehydrogenase catalyzes the
reversible pyridine nucleotide-dependent oxidative deamination of
saccharopine to yield L-lysine and 2-oxoglutarate; however, its
homology to alanine dehydrogenase suggests that the nitrogen
assimilation from ammonium can potentially also be catalyzed
by saccharopine dehydrogenase. Thus, the nitrogen assimilation
through the conversion of pyruvate to L-alanine appears to exist in
the S.cerevisiae metabolism. Consequently, using PAPi we detected
a potential secondary nitrogen assimilation pathway not previously
described for S.cerevisiae and not observed by Villas-Boas et al.
(2005a) and Cakir et a1. (2006). Future experiments are required to
conﬁrm this hypothesis.

4 THE PACKAGE

The PAPi package comprises four functions: papi , papi .pca ,
papi .htest and papi . line. papi is used to calculate the
ASS for each sample and stores these, together with the list of all
active pathways, in a data frame. [Output generated by the papi
function can be demonstrated using data(demo.results).]
papi .pca generates biplots that can be used to verify sample
reproducibility and to explore the pathways that may be responsible
for the differences between experimental conditions. papi .htes t
performs either a t-test or ANOVA on the ASS and can be used
to identify pathways that are differentially active, since these are
generally thought to be important in terms of observed differences
in metabolism between different conditions. Finally, the results can
be summarized using papi . line that generates a line graph of
average AS plotted against pathway. Pathway activity proﬁles of all
experimental conditions can be superimposed on the same graph.
(See Supplementary Fig. 6A, B).

PAPi can be applied to the analysis of intra- (i.e. metabolic
ﬁngerprinting) and extracellular metabolites (i.e. metabolic
footprinting).

4.1 Requirements

PAPi was developed under R version 2.10.1 and depends on six
other packages, namely KEGGSOAP (Zhang and Gentleman, 2009)

and KEGG.db (Carlson et al., 2009) from Bioconductor, and reshape
(Wickham, 2007), gdata (Wames, 2010), gplots (Wames, 2009) and
plotrix (Lemon, 2010). All of these packages can be installed from
the Bioconductor database (http://www.bioconductor.org/) using:

>source ( ‘http: //bioconductor . org/biocLite .R’)

>biocLite (C ( ‘KEGGSOAP’ , ‘ KEGG. db’ ,
‘reshape’ , ‘gdata’ , ‘gplots’ , ‘plotrix' ))

4.2 Descriptions

We now describe the usage of the four ﬁinctions in PAPi : papi ,
papi .pca, papi .htest and papi . line.

0 papi(conditions, data = ‘import',
out.folder = ‘popup’)

papi is applied to a data frame in which the ﬁrst column contains
the identiﬁed metabolites’ KEGG codes and all subsequent columns
contain their abundances in each analyzed sample. (The KEGG
codes can be found at http://www.genome.j p/dbget-bin/www_bﬁnd?
compound and consist of the letter ‘C’ followed by a sequence of
5 digits, e.g. Glucose = C00031.) For a sample data frame showing
the layout required by papi, see data (demo) .

papi comprises three arguments: conditions, data and
out. folder. The conditions argument takes a character
vector of treatment names, e.g. conditions = c ( ’ condl ’ ,
‘cond2 ’ ). The data : ‘import ’ (default) argument results
in a pop up dialog box, allowing the user to click-and-point to
the comma-separated value (CSV) format ﬁle from which the data
is to be read. Alternatively, data can take the name of a data
frame containing the samples’ metabolite abundances. Similarly, the
default behavior of out . folder is for a pop-up dialog box to
be presented to the user. The user can then select the directory to
which the results will be saved. Alternatively, out . folder takes
a character string naming the path to the directory where the results
are to be saved. Since there are no restrictions on the column names
of the initial input data frame, during the execution all PAPi functions
the user is presented with a dialog box from which he/she must select
the columns of the data frame associated with each experimental
condition.

papi generates a data frame containing the pathways identiﬁed
across all samples, their KEGG codes and their ASS. In addition,
papi calculates the average and standard error of the ASS by
condition for each pathway, and these are stored in the same data
frame (See data (demo . results) for an example.). This data
frame is automatically saved to a ﬁle named papi_results . csv
in the directory speciﬁed by out . folder.

0 papi.htest(conditions, data = ‘import',
signif.1eve1 = 0.05, save = TRUE,
out.folder = ‘popup’)

The conditions , data and out . folder arguments behave
as described in the papi function. If conditions is of length
2 (i.e. there are only two experimental conditions) then a t-test is
used to test for differential pathway activity between conditions,
otherwise ANOVA is used. A column of P-values resulting from the

analyses carried out on the ASS from each pathway is added to the
initial input data frame. The level of signiﬁcance, speciﬁed by the
s igni f . l eve l argument, is used to create a data frame consisting
of only the differentially active pathways. When the argument s ave
: TRUE (default) this data frame is saved to a CSV ﬁle called
papi_anova . csv.

0 papi.pca(graph.na.me, data = ‘import',
loadings.code = TRUE, save = TRUE,
out.folder = ‘popup’)

The data and out . folder arguments again behave as described
in the papi function, and the save argument as in papi .htest.
papi .pca can be used to apply PCA to the data frames generated
by papi and/or papi .htest. Single or multiple biplots, one
per graphical device, can be generated. The number is determined
by the length of the character vector supplied to graph.name.
If loadings .code = TRUE, the KEGG code of identiﬁed
pathways will be used as loadings, otherwise the pathways’ names
will be used. If save : TRUE (default), a ﬁle containing a
PCA biplot will be generated for each graph with the name
format PCAgraph . name .png. For example, if graph.names :
c ( ‘condl ’ , ‘cond2 ’ , ‘condl+cond2 ' ) then three ﬁles
will be generated, namely PCAcondl .png, PCAcondZ .png
and PCAcondl+cond2 .png. (See Supplementary Fig. 6C and D)

0 papi.line(conditions, data = ‘import',
relative = TRUE, save = TRUE, out.folder
= ‘POPuP')

The conditions, data, save and out.folder arguments
behave as described in the papi . htes t. papi . line generates a
line graph in which, for each condition, the average normalized total
ASS are plotted against the identiﬁed pathways (see Supplementary
Fig. 6A, B). The relative : TRUE (default) argument results
in a line graph of pathway activity proﬁles for each target condition
relative to the selected reference condition. By default, the ﬁrst
element of the conditions argument is deﬁned as the reference
condition. Pathways not identiﬁed in the reference condition are
excluded from the plot. A horizontal line is drawn at zero to
serve as a visual reference (see Supplementary Fig. 6B). Plots
of the untransformed ASS can be generated setting relative
: FALSE. If save : TRUE, the line graph is saved to a ﬁle
called papi_line_graph.png in the directory speciﬁed by
out . folder.

5 CONCLUSION

We introduced and validated here a new algorithm (PAPi) and
an R package (PAPi) able to correlate metabolomics datasets and
metabolic pathways activities in a high-throughput way. Doing so,
we are able to compare the activity of metabolic pathways under
different conditions, which provides great support for hypothesis
generation and facilitates the biological interpretation. Furthermore,
as KEGG database also supports enquires using protein and gene
transcription levels, PAPi has the potential to combine data from
different omics in one unique framework, ﬁirther simplifying the
biological interpretation of the data.

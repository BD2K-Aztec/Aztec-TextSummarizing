ABSTRACT

Motivation: Understanding how drugs and diseases are associated
in the molecular level is of critical importance to unveil disease
mechanisms and treatments. Until recently, few studies attempt end
to discover important gene modules shared by both drugs and
diseases.

Results: Here, we propose a novel presentation of drug—gene—
disease relationship, a ‘co-module’, which is characterized by closely
related drugs, diseases and genes. We first define a network-
based gene closeness profile to relate drug to disease. Then,
we develop a Bayesian partition method to identify drug—gene—
disease co-modules underlying the gene closeness data. Genes
share similar notable patterns with respect not only to the drugs
but also the diseases within a co-module. Simulations show that our
method, comClPHER, achieves a better performance compared with
a popular co-module detection method, PPA. We apply comClPHER
to a set consisting of 723 drugs, 275 diseases and 1442 genes
and demonstrate that our co-module approach is able to identify
new drug—disease associations and highlight their molecular basis.
Disease co-morbidity emerges as well. Three co-modules are further
illustrated in which new drug applications, including the anti-
cancer metastasis activity of an anti-asthma drug Pranlukast, and
a cardiovascular stress-testing agent Arbutamine for obesity, as
well as potential side-effects, e.g. hypotension for Triamterene, are
computationally identified.

1 INTRODUCTION

Drugs achieve their therapeutic functions by targeting gene products
relevant to an abnormal state. On the one hand, drugs do not always
follow a ‘one gene, one drug, one disease’ paradigm (Hopkins,
2008). Such promiscuities result in unanticipated actions, some of
which may lead to serious side-effects (Campillos et (11., 2008);
others may induce drug new applications and therefore guide drug

repositioning (Chong and Sullivan, 2007). On the other hand,
complex human diseases are often multi-factor—driven, involving
dysfunctions of dozens of genes (Goh et (11., 2007). Identifying such
disease-relevant gene modules helps us decipher how an abnormal
phenotype is induced and therefore in turn offers opportunities for
the development of new therapies (Barabasi et (11., 2011).

With this understanding, it is of great importance to investigate
how drugs exert their activities directly or indirectly via those gene
modules, how pathophenotypes are inﬂuenced by the abnormality
of gene modules, and most notably, how drugs and disease
phenotypes are associated on the basis of gene modules (Schadt
et (11., 2009). However, few analyses address these questions
together in a systematic View. Segal et (11. (2004) initiatively
Characterized different tumor types by predeﬁned gene modules
using gene expression data. However, their method is largely
dependent on the prior knowledge of gene modules and does not
involve drugs. Wong et (11. (2008) connected gene modules with
human cancers by deﬁning a module map, which was shown to
guide new disease therapies. Suthram et (11. (2010) demonstrated
that common functional gene modules underlie similar diseases, and
highlighted the therapeutic importance of those modules. Chiang
and Butte (2009) proposed a network-based approach to discover
new drug indications by connecting disease pairs sharing therapies.
Novel drug uses were predicted. Recently, Gottlieb et (11. (2011)
developed a computational method, PREDICT, to identify drug—
disease associations and predict new drug indications. A 0.9 area
under the curve (AUC) demonstrates the power of their method.
Nevertheless, few existing studies attempt to identify gene modules
important both in drugs and diseases.

In current study, we aim to investigate drug—disease associations
and their shared gene modules on a network basis. It has been widely
shown that the modularity of genes can be Characterized by a tightly
interconnected subnetwork of their products in the protein—protein
interaction network or the interactome network (Barabasi et (11.,
2011). In our previous studies, we proposed a measurement termed
gene closeness to describe such interconnectedness and then used
it to predict drug targets (Zhao and Li, 2010) and disease genes
(Wu et (11., 2008). The gene closeness is calculated according to
known drug—target (disease—gene) relations as well as the shortest
distance in the interactome network. A gene whose products is
more highly interconnected in interactome network with drug targets
(disease gene products) receives a higher closeness score with
respect to that drug (disease) (Section 4). Here, we use such a
closeness index to deﬁne a gene closeness proﬁle to relate drugs to
diseases, and then identify important gene modules that both tightly
interconnect with drug targets and disease genes from this proﬁle.

We call a gene module and those drugs and diseases associated
with it a ‘Co-module’, the word that was initially proposed by
Kutalik et (11. ,in studying drug—gene associations along different cell
lines (Kutalik et (11., 2008). In short, co-module suggests to divide
biological elements into sets that share similarly signiﬁcant pattern
in order to study their interconnections. We introduce this concept
here to analyze drug—disease relationships and, at the same time,
elucidate their molecular connections by ﬁinctional gene modules
in an interactome network. We further develop a Bayesian partition
method to identify such drug—gene—disease co-modules. We name
our method comCIPHER (co-module) following the drugCIPHER
(Zhao and Li, 2010) and CIPHER (Wu et (11., 2008) methods due
to their commonality in using network closeness to study drug—
gene or disease—gene relations. Within a co-module, genes share
similar notable patterns in the closeness proﬁle with respect not
only to the associated drugs but also the diseases. By deﬁning
the indicator variables for each co-module, comCIPHER constructs
a Markov Chain that traverses the variable space and seeks to
ﬁnd the indicator variables that ﬁt the statistical model to the
largest extent. Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) strategies are
introduced to determine transition moves. Speciﬁcally, comCIPHER
ﬁrst partitions the genes in the closeness proﬁles into different gene
modules. Then, in each gene module, comCIPHER partitions the
drugs and diseases into two categories: those that are associated
with the gene module, and those that are not. Drugs and diseases
associated with the same gene module as well as those genes
themselves form a co-module (Fig. 1). In this article, we ﬁrst
compare comCIPHER with a state-of-the-art modular algorithm
PPA (Ping-Pong Algorithm) (Kutalik et (11., 2008) in simulation and
demonstrate a better performance of comCIPHER. Then, we use
comCIPHER to identify drug—gene—disease co-modules based on
the closeness proﬁle data. The 86 co-modules are identiﬁed, in which
not only drugs with common targets and diseases with shared genes
are signiﬁcantly enriched, but disease co-morbidity emerges as well.
After multiple test corrections, 24 co-modules are selected in which
new drug—disease associations and their molecular connections are
indicated. Our co-module approach renders a promising perspective
to investigate drug—disease associations and provides computational
evidence to reveal their mechanisms basis.

2 RESULTS

We selected FDA-approved ‘promiscuous’ drugs (Yildirim et (11.,
2007) with multiple targets and diseases with multiple susceptibility
genes in current study for co-module analysis. As we were also
interested in human cancers, antineoplastic drugs and cancers were
included. Finally, 723 drugs and 275 diseases from the DrugBank
(Wishart et (11., 2008) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) (MCKusiCk, 2007) databases, respectively, were selected as
our candidate set. The interactome network data was an integration
of ﬁve protein interaction databases (Section 4). We mapped drug
targets and disease genes onto the integrated interactome network,
generating 3702 drug—target and 877 disease—gene relations.

2.1 Performance of ComCIPHER

In short, comCIPHER deﬁnes the partition indicator variables for
each co-module and constructs a Markov Chain to sample from
their posterior distribution given the observation data. After the

Fig. 1. Scheme of comClPHER. ComCIPHER ﬁrst partitions the genes into
different gene modules, including a NULL module. In each gene module,
comClPHER further partitions drugs and diseases into two categories: those
that are associated with the gene module and those are not. Drugs and diseases
associated with the same gene module and those genes themselves form a
co-module.

Chain burn-in, the partition conﬁguration receiving a higher posterior
density will be more likely to be sampled (See Section 4 for details).
To evaluate the performance of comCIPHER, we compared it with a
popular modular algorithm, PPA (Kutalik et (11., 2008) and a method
directly using correlation coefﬁcient. PPA is an iterative algorithm
used to discover co-modules residing in two data matrices sharing
one dimension and has been shown as the most robust and accurate
co-module detection algorithm (Kutalik et (11., 2008). With a large
number of random initial seeds, PPA iteratively computes three
weight vectors for each dimension until a convergence condition
satisﬁed. The converged weight vectors describe the associations
between the three dimensions and are therefore interpreted as
co-module indicators.

To make it comparable, we used the method described in (Kutalik
et (11., 2008) to generate simulation data. In general, we deﬁned
three kinds of ‘factors’: (i) drug—disease co-factors, which induce
the involvement of certain genes in drug activity, and at the same
time, stimulate the susceptibilities of those genes to some diseases;
(ii) pure drug factors, which only induce gene involvement in
drug activities; and (iii) pure disease factors, which only affect the
susceptibilities between genes and diseases. Drug—disease co-factors
determine the co-modules, and pure factors determine the respective
drug or disease modules. In the performed simulations, we generated
18 factors underlying 100 drugs, 80 diseases and 250 genes. There
were six co-factors, six pure drug factors and six pure disease factors.
For each of those six factors, we set three as positive and three as
negative. We deﬁned the complexity level as the maximum number
of factors per drug or disease. With a complexity level larger than
one, drugs or diseases could be associated with multiple co-modules.
We ﬁirther deﬁne the noise level as the variance of a normal noise
with zero mean added to the simulation data (See Supplementary
Material for details about simulation data). We Chose noise levels of
0.2, 04, 0.6 and 0.8 with a complexity level of two, and complexity
levels of one, two, three and four with a noise of 0.5 in simulation,
and generated 10 matrix pairs of the drug—gene and disease—gene
data for each of the noise and complexity combination. An example
of the simulation data with a complexity level two and noise level 0.4
is shown in Figure 2A and B. Then, comCIPHER was applied to the

simulation data with a predeﬁned co-module numberM=20. We also
adopted the method in PPA to compute the receiver operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve. We deﬁned the drug—gene (disease—
gene) posterior association score for drug 1' (disease j) and gene
g, ASl-g (AS jg), as the sum of the products of posterior probabilities
of drug and gene (disease and gene) indicators across all co-modules
except the NULL, and deﬁned the drug—disease posterior association
score for i,j, ASl-j, as the sum of the products of ASl-g and ASjg
across all genes (Section 4). The ROC curve was computed based
on ASl-J~ as well as on the ‘true’ drug—disease relations. Figure 2F,
G and H, respectively, depicts the ASl-g, ASjg and ASl-J~ under the
posterior probabilities of indicator variables shown in Figure 2C, D
and E. For the PPA algorithm, the parameters were set to the same
values mentioned in the supplement ﬁle of Kutalik et (11.’s (2008)
work. For the correlation method, we simply calculated the Pearson’s
correlation coefﬁcient between drug 1' and disease j across all genes
as the associate score. The results are shown in Table 2.1. Both
of comCIPHER and PPA outperform the correlation method and
exhibit good performance under low complexity and noise levels.
At high complexity and noise levels, comCIPHER outperforms the
PPA method.

The selection of co-module number M has impacts in the results
of comCIPHER. In simulation, we found that if we Chose M large,

comCIPHER was able to identify co-modules precisely. As a price,
this will increase its computational burden. However if M is small,
it will lead misclassiﬁcations. We also found if there were empty co-
modules left after thresholding the posterior probabilities, the ROC
integral for discovering drug—disease associations was fairly good.
Therefore, we practically used a criterion that whether there existed
empty co-modules to determine the sufﬁciency of M when applying
to real data. See Supplementary Material for more details.

2.2 Drug—gene-disease co-module detection in gene
closeness proﬁle data

Before running comCIPHER on the drug and disease gene closeness
proﬁle data, we normalized the data to reduce the biases for
drugs (diseases) with larger number of targets (disease genes). We
further eliminated non-speciﬁc genes that received scores with small
variation across both drugs and diseases, leaving 1442 genes for co-
module analysis (Section 4). We ran comCIPHER on this subset
in the interactome with M=100 and Chose 0.9 as the posterior
probability threshold for the indicator variables. Under these criteria,
86 co-modules were identiﬁed along with eight drug modules and
two disease modules. There were four empty co-modules left,
suggesting the number of M was sufﬁcient.

We also ran PPA on the proﬁle data to compare the performance
of comCIPHER and PPA in a real application. Totally 19 921
co-modules with redundancy were obtained. We compared the
following six indexes: averaged and minimum network shortest
distances between drug targets (DTs) and co-module genes (CGs),
disease genes (PGs) and CGs as well as DTs and PGs. The results
are shown in Table 2.2. It can be seen that comCIPHER has
shorter distances in all these indexes except the averaged distance
between DTs and PGs, indicating drugs, diseases and genes are
more interconnected in co-modules obtained by comCIPHER. We
also found in the 86 co-modules identiﬁed by comCIPHER, drugs
tended to have similar structural similarities (P <0.001, permutation
test) and share targets (11.7-fold enrichment, P<2.2E-16, Fisher’s
exact test, one-sided); diseases tended to have similar phenotypic
similarities (van Driel et (11., 2006) (P <0.001, permutation test) and
share susceptibility genes (37-fold enrichment, P <2.2E-16, Fisher’s
exact test, one-sided). See Supplementary Material for details.

It is shown that diseases may co-occur according to shared
metabolic pathways (Lee et (11., 2008) or cellular networks (Park

et al., 2009), resulting in disease co-morbidity. We found that
diseases in the co-modules also tended to have co-morbidity. We
computed the co-morbidity P-value for each disease pair according
to co-occurrence diagnosis data in (Park et al., 2009) study. We
ﬁirther selected disease pairs with signiﬁcant co-morbidity under
a 005 false discovery rate (FDR) control (Benjamini—Hochberg
correction). In all, 902 disease pairs were selected in our candidate
set, out of which 27 were found in the 86 co-modules. The results
generated a 6.8-fold enrichment compared to random selection
(P = 7.95E-15, Fisher’s exact test, one-sided).

It is noted that high network interconnectedness might indicate
but not guarantee drug—disease associations [See ref (Yildirim et al.,
2007) and Supplementary Material]. We, therefore, used the known
drug—disease associations in the Comparative Toxicogenomics
Database (CTD) database (Davis et al., 2009) to ﬁlter out those
co-modules unlikely to have new drug—disease associations. This
is based on the assumption that if signiﬁcant drug—disease pairs in
a selected co-module are known to be associated, other drugs or
diseases, which are topologically Closely related, might also tend
to be associated. For each co-module, we computed a P-value
in which the known drug—disease associations were observed by
Chance (Fisher’s exact test, one-sided). Under a 0.05 FDR control,
24 co-modules were selected (Benjamini—Hochberg correction). We
selected three representative co-modules to provide demonstrations
of our results.

A co-module relevant to cell proliferation and human cancers:
there are 14 genes, 3 drugs and 3 diseases in this co-module.
We ﬁnd the drug targets and disease genes are either directly
connected to each other or linked tightly by the co-module genes
in the interactome network (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table S2).
We use gene functional annotation analysis provided by DAVID
(Huang et al., 2008) to investigate the functional enrichment of
the 14 co-module genes. Two GO terms, regulation of apoptosis
(P = 5.1E-9, FDR = 8.2E-7) and regulation of programmed
cell death (P = 5.6E-9, FDR = 7.1E-7) are ranked as the most
signiﬁcantly enriched biological process (BP) terms (Supplementary
Table S2), indicating that those genes serve important roles in the
regulation of cell proliferation. Two disease pairs show signiﬁcant
co-morbidity: Gastric Cancer and Lung Cancer (P = 0.000003,
FDR = 0.00007), Gastric Cancer and Breast-Ovarian Cancer (P =
0.000237, FDR = 0.000611). In this co-module, the angiogenesis
inhibitor, Thalidomide, is found to have associations with the
three diseases in the CTD database (P = 0.0012, FDR = 0.0015).
Interestingly, a drug used for the treatment of asthma (Pranlukast)
and an anti-bacterial agent (Minocycline) are also included in this

Fig. 3. Three co-module examples. (A) The most enriched GO term in this
co-module is regulation of apoptosis. The anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic
activities respective for Minocycline and Pranlukast were reported previously
and may suggest their new applications in human cancer. (B) A subnetwork
of the co-module presented in (A) demonstrates the molecular network
connections between Pranlukast and lung cancer. (C) Two ﬁ-adrenergic
receptors (ADRB2 and ADRB3) are known drug targets, disease susceptible
genes and co-module genes. Further analysis reveals Arbutamine’s potential
uses for asthma and obesity. (D) Two phenotypically opposite diseases
are included in this co-module, demonstrating that different mutations in
the same genes could cause distinct phenotypes. We further demonstrate
the potential application of Triamterene to Liddle Syndrome, and predict
Triamterene’s PHAlB-like side-effects.

co-module. After ﬁirther analysis, we ﬁnd that Pranlukast’s activity
in the inhibition of tumor metastasis by targeting TNF, NF-KB and
MUC2 was reported (Kishiokaa et al., 2005) and is currently being
investigated as a new treatment for human cancers. Minocycline also
was conﬁrmed to have anti-angiogenic activity due to its interaction
with VEGF (Yao et al., 2007). ComCIPHER successﬁilly identiﬁed
these new drug applications. We extracted a subnetwork of this
co-module to demonstrate the possible mechanisms of association
between Pranlukast and lung cancer (Fig. 3B). In one way, by
targeting TNF, Pranlukast triggers cell apoptosis (Wang et al., 1996)
by inducing the expression of CASP4 and CASP8 (Chu and Chen,
2008), therefore exhibiting anti-cancer activity. In another way, its
interactions with TNF and NF-KB inﬂuence the activity of VIM
(Huber et al., 2004) and RIPKl (Wang et al., 2008) , which further
inhibits the EGFR gene and therefore suppresses tumor cell growth
(Nicholson et al., 2001). Moreover, ERCC6, an important gene
in DNA repair, is directly connected to the target NF-KB. This
gene is also reported as a susceptibility gene for various human

cancers, including lung cancer (Chiu et al., 2008). It is possible that
Pranlukast induce the expression of ERCC6 and therefore increase
the DNA repair capacity in cancer cells. Our co-module approach
identiﬁed new drug—disease associations for the two drugs in this
co-module and highlighted their possible molecular basis.

A co-module related to ﬂ-adrenergic receptors: eight genes,
six drugs and two diseases exist in this co-module (Fig. 3C,
Supplementary Table S3). The three most signiﬁcantly enriched GO
BP terms are positive regulation of MAPKKK cascade (P = 2.6E-4,
FDR=8.9E-2), regulation of GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)
protein signaling pathway (P=2.9E-4, FDR=5.1E-2) and fat
cell differentiation (P=3.1E-4, FDR=3.7E-2). Co-morbidity
signiﬁcantly exists between Asthma and Obesity (P <E-8,
FDR<E-8). It was shown that the three ﬂ-adrenergic receptor
subtypes (ADRB1,ADRB2 and ADRB3) have important inﬂuences
on human muscle and fat metabolism (Mersmann, 1998) and have
therefore been used as targets for the treatment of both asthma and
obesity(Lazarus et al., 2001). Two of the adrenergic receptors are
successﬁilly identiﬁed as co-module genes by comCIPHER. Out
of the 12 drug—disease relations in this co-module, 10 are found
in the CTD database (P = 6.55E-15, FDR = 6.87E-15), leaving
Arbutamine as the only drug with no disease associations. Same as
a ﬂ-adrenergic agonist, we believe it could serve as a new treatment
for asthma. Moreover, It was reported that Arbutamine is used as a
cardiovascular stress-testing agent and could achieve similar effects
as exercise by targeting ﬂ-adrenergic receptors (MCDOWELL,
2000). Therefore, we suggest Arbutamine could be used to treat
obesity.

A co-module related to epithelial sodium channel: there
are 10 genes, 2 drugs and 2 diseases in this co-module
(Fig. 3D, Supplementary Table S4). GO enrichment analysis
shows that Sodium Channel activity (P=2.7E-7, FDR=7.6E-6)
and Sodium ion binding (P=1.4E-5, FDR=2.0E-4) are ranked
as the most signiﬁcantly enriched molecular ﬁinction terms.
Interestingly, Liddle Syndrome disease, which is Characterized
by severe hypertension (Shimkets et al., 1994), and the
Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type one (PHAlB) disease, which shows
vomiting, dehydration and hypotension (Chang et al., 1996), are
both identiﬁed as co-module diseases. The two diseases not only
show signiﬁcant co-morbidity (P <E-8, FDR<E-8) but also share
two susceptibility genes. This example demonstrates the possibility
that different mutations in the same genes may cause opposite
phenotypes (Berger et al., 2010). In this co-module, the three
genes (SCNNlA, SCNNlB and SCNNlG) encoding the subunits
of epithelial sodium Channel (ENaC) are all identiﬁed as oo-
module genes. These genes are also the known drug targets
and disease susceptibility genes. Two drug—disease associations
are supported by the CTD database (P =0.0037, FDR=0.0047).
Amiloride was demonstrated antihypertensive action by inhibiting
sodium re-absorption through blocking sodium Channels, therefore
is associated with Liddle Syndrome (Shimkets et al., 1994). Its
adverse effects on moderate hypertension leading to hypotension
(Saini et al., 1998) may account for its association with PHAlB
disease. For another drug, Triamterene, no drug—disease association
was recorded in the CTD database. Nevertheless, just like those of an
epithelial sodium Channel blocker, the applications of Triamterene
for the treatment of hypertension and Liddle Syndrome were
previously reported (Heath and Freis, 1963; Wang et al., 1981).
Moreover, Triamterene is also a mild diuretic, and its adverse

reactions, including nausea and hypotension, were studied (Knowles
et al., 2005). Our co-module approach not only identiﬁed a new
application for Triamterene but also predicted its PHAlB-like
side-effects.

3 DISCUSSION

In this study, we propose a novel interpretation of drug—disease
relationships and seek to decipher their molecular basis by proposing
the drug—gene—disease co-module using computational means. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to present
and investigate drug—gene-disease relationships using functionally
related co-modules. Then, we develop a Bayesian partition method
to identify drug—gene—disease co-modules from gene closeness
data. The simulation study demonstrates the superior performance
of comCIPHER in co-module detection. As discussed, modular
presentation of biological data has several advantages. First, it can
discover subtle associations between biological elements that are
too weak to detect by considering all of their features as a whole
(Bergmann et al., 2003), which also was noted in microarray data
analysis (Hu and Qin, 2009). Second, the complex interconnections
between elements suggest that modular measurements are more
robust than treating each element individually (Kutalik et al., 2008).

The approach used in the current study possesses several merits.
First, we ﬁnd that drugs and diseases in the 86 co-modules
tend to share targets or disease genes and may therefore serve
as another way to identify new drug targets and disease genes.
Moreover, disease co-morbidities also tend to enrich in co-modules,
suggesting the potential application of co-modules in disease
diagnosis and prognosis. Second, compared with PPA method,
the indicator variables used in comCIPHER provide a relatively
Clear structure of co-modules, which facilitates the interpretation of
results. Moreover, simulations show that as long as M is sufﬁciently
large comCIPHER can identify not only the real co-modules but
also pure drug and disease modules, which could be missed by
PPA. These single dimensional modules serve to ﬁnd common
molecular interconnections between different drugs or diseases and
thus are also of value. Third, those unselected co-modules in which
no signiﬁcant drug—disease associations are found are still useful.
On the one hand, the incompleteness in current knowledge might
suggest unknown associations existing in those co-modules. On the
other hand, even though prior knowledge indicates no association
in a co-module, understanding why those network-related drug—
disease relations do not tend to yield associations may provide new
insights into the mechanistic understanding of drug—disease relations
and generate new hypotheses (Hopkins, 2008).

Some aspects of the implementation of comCIPHER are worth
mentioning. Although the MCMC method theoretically guarantees
that the Markov Chain will converge to the target distribution,
because the number of iterations is always ﬁnite, it is possible that
the Chain will be trapped in a local mode. We handled this problem
by adopting parallel tempering (Gilks et al., 1996; Zhang et al.,
2010) with multiple Chains under different temperatures and with
different initial points. Still, the Chain must be monitored carefully
to determine its burn-in state and convergence. Moreover, when the
dimension becomes very large, the Chain will move very slowly.
Therefore, we only focused on a small subset of genes in this
study, though this may make us lose some useﬁil information. In
addition, if we Choose M larger, comCIPHER tends to break data

into smaller blocks and increases the precision. As a price, this
will increase its computational burden. In comparison, PPA has
a tolerable computational expense. Therefore, we suggest that an
integrated version which uses PPA to estimate the M and uses
comCIPHER to learn the Clear structure might be preferable.

In summary, we developed a novel co-module approach to
discover drug—gene—disease relationships based on an interactome
network, and demonstrated its application by showing that
new drug—disease associations and their molecular connections
were found in co-modules. Different from previous reductionism
analyses, such a co-module approach offers a systematic and holistic
view to study drug—disease relationships and their molecular basis. It
may also provide new insights into unveiling the action mechanisms
of traditional Chinese medicine, which is featured by treating
multiple diseases using a herb combination from a holistic view
(Li et al., 2010, 2011). In total, our analysis reveals a promising
perspective to study drug and disease relationships in terms of
network pharmacology (Hopkins, 2008) and systems biology.

4 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data preparation: the protein interaction data used in current study was an
integration of ﬁve databases (See Supplementary Material). We mapped the
UniProt protein ID to the human Entrez gene ID and obtained 137 037 PPIs
for 13 388 unique genes. These data were extracted in January 2011.

The information of drugs and their targets was extracted from DrugBank
(Wishart et al., 2008) in February 2011. We selected FDA-approved drugs
with multiple targets existing in the integrated interactome, generating 685
candidate drugs. Merged with 78 anti-neoplastic drugs in DrugBank, we
generated 723 drugs with 3702 drugitarget relations for co-module analysis.
Disease and susceptibility gene relations were extracted from the OMIM
database (McKusick, 2007) in January 2011. In all, 235 diseases were
found to have multiple susceptibility genes existing in interactome network.
After integrated with 76 cancer diseases, 275 diseases were included in our
candidate set. Known drugAiisease associations were extracted from CTD
database (Davis et al., 2009) in March 2011. The CTD database contains
two kinds of chemical(drug)7disease relations: curated and inferred. We
extracted two kinds of chemicalidisease relations, both curated and inferred,
without discrimination of inference score. After chemical-drug and MeSH-
OMIM identiﬁer mapping, 5018 drugAiisease associations were found in
our candidate sets (See Supplementary Material).

Before running comClPHER on closeness proﬁle data, we normalized
the proﬁles to make the gene scores have a same distribution for different
drugs or diseases, aiming to reduce the bias caused by differences in target or
disease gene numbers. Then we ﬁltered out genes which received closeness
scores with small variations across drugs and diseases, generating 1442 genes
for further analysis (See Supplementary Material).

Gene closeness: given a drug i , a gene g and an interactome network, the
closeness of g to i is computed as follows,

2
—L
¢ig= Z 6 “k. (1)
new)

where gk is a target gene of i in its target set T(i), and ngk is the shortest
network distance between gene g and gk. We computed gene closeness to
disease j in a similar manner using disease genes in the network (Wu et al.,
2008).

ComCIPHER: we proposed a Bayesian partition method to identify drugi
geneAiisease co-modules. The statistical model of comClPHER was inspired
by Zhang et al. (2010) work. Given drugigene and diseaseigene proﬁle
data and a predeﬁned co-module number M , comClPHER ﬁrst partitions
genes into M +1 modules, including a NULL module. Then, for each non-
NULL module, comClPHER classiﬁes drugs or diseases into two categories:

associated with the gene module and not. The genes, drugs and diseases that
are associated with that gene module form a co-module.

Consider a case where D drugs, P diseases and G genes exist. We
denote the drugigene proﬁle data as matrix Y=((yig)) for drug i and
gene g. Similarly, the diseaseigene proﬁle data are denoted as matrix
Z =((zjg)) for disease j. Then, we deﬁne gene indicator variable Ig:
{Igg e{0,---M};g=1,---G} to indicate the co-module that gene g belongs
to; the drug indicator variable Id={Ia',,,ie{0,1};m=1,---M;i=1,---D} to
determine whether drug i belongs to co-module m or not and Ip: {Ipmj e
{0, 1};m= 1, - - -M;j= 1, - - -P} to determine whether diseasej belongs to co-
module In. In co-module m, we model drugigene proﬁle values as a normal
distribution formulized by following equation:

yig = 811111 +dmi ‘I' agd ‘I' Egd « (2)

where (SM is the co-module speciﬁc effect on drugigene data; (1,”, is the
drug-speciﬁc factor in co-module m; agd is the gene-speciﬁc factor and egd
is a random noise. The subscript (1 indicates the speciﬁc parameters in the
drugigene data. For drug i’ that does not belong to the co-module m,

y,/g~1v<ag.i. rim). (3)
In the NULL module, we model the drugigene proﬁle distribution as
yig ~N<agd. rap. (4)

Similar distributions are set for the diseaseigene proﬁle data.

We later deﬁne Bd: {ﬁdmi =8md +a',,,,»;m= 1, - - -M; i: {Idmi = 1}} and
Bp = {ﬁpmj 28m], +p,,,j;m = 1, - - -M;j : {Ipmj =1}} as co-module center
matrices. Joint posterior distribution for lg, Id, Ip and Ed, Bp can be
expressed as follows given Y,Z:

P(Ig.ld. Bd. IquplY. Z) 0<

(5)
/P(Y.Z.Bd.Bp|®.Ig.Id.Ip)P(®IIg.Id.Ip)n(Ig.Id.Ip)d®

We set conjugate priors for those parameters to integrate out those
nuisance variables and derive the posterior distribution in a closed form.
To penalize co-modules with large numbers of elements, we set a prior for
indicator variables as follows:

M M M
7t(Ig,Id,Ip)<xexp[—CG Eng—c0 Eng—q. 2:25,}, (6)

111:] "1:1 "1:1

where ng,nf,)l,nf; are gene, drug and disease number, respectively, in co-
module In and CO, CD, Cp are penalizing parameters.

MCMC strategies are adopted to construct a Markov chain that converges

to the posterior distribution. The Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hasting
algorithm are used to determine the transition moves of the chain. Parallel
tempering (Gilks et al., 1996; Liu, 2001 ; Zhang et al., 2010) is also adopted to
help the chain escape local modes. See Supplementary Material for details.
Association scores for computing ROC integral: we deﬁne the posterior
association score AS,»g (ASJ-g) between drug i (disease j) and gene g as the
sum of the products of posterior indicator probabilities for i U) and g across
all co-modules except the NULL. Then, we deﬁne the drugidisease posterior
association score ASU- as the sum of the products ofAS,»g and ASJ-g across all
genes (See Supplementary Material).
Poisson approximation for co-occurrence data: the co-occurrence data from
the study of (Park et al., 2009) records the frequencies for observing two
diseases respectively and jointly. We adopt the same method to compute a
P-Value for the signiﬁcance of co-morbidity of two diseases. Suppose 1
and 11-; individuals are observed to have diseases j 1 ande, respectively, and
C112 individuals have both diseases. The expected number of individuals
having both diseases is 12 211-1 *Ijz /N under an independence assumption,
where N is the total number of individuals. A Poisson distribution is used
to approximate this binomial model. Under this approximation, the P-Value
for co-morbidity of j 1 and jg is the probability of observing more individuals
than C112 having both diseases (See Supplementary Material).

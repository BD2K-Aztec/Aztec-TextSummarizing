"Illumina array genotyping rate (GR).

CGenotypes checked against expected alleles, Y : yes, N : no.
dArrayMaker GR.

eMean concordance of ArrayMaker with Illumina array calls, as a total of all markers where a missing call was made by neither platform.

HMean percentage of discordant call type, expressed as a total of all markers where a missing call was made by neither platform. fMismatch, more than two alleles observed
across both platformsgAlternate homozygote, both platforms called a homozygote for a different allele. hHeterozygote overcall, Illumina array indicated homozygote and
ArrayMaker called a heterozygote. iHeterozygote undercall, opposite of heterozygote overcall.

ArrayMaker has four genotyping options: high or low strin—
gency calling, with genotypes checked or not checked against
expected alleles. Low stringency includes reads not mapped in
a proper pair. High stringency applies an extended base align—
ment quality calculation, downgrades mapping quality for
excessive mismatches and excludes loci signiﬁcantly affected by
strand bias. Failure of a checked ArrayMaker genotype to
concord with expected alleles after allowing for strandedness
(mismatch error, ‘Mis.’ Table l) downgrades a call to missing
status. The greatest concordance rate was observed when low
stringency was applied and genotypes were checked against ex—
pected alleles (Table l).

The predominant GBS error type was undercalls of heterozy—
gotes (false negatives; true genotype is polymorphic yet the call is
homozygous reference or ‘missing’) (Table 1). Low stringency
genotyping resulted in a lower proportion of heterozygote under—
calls and an increase in apparently false heterozygotes (false posi—
tives; true genotype is homozygous reference yet the call is
polymorphic) compared to high stringency. Of the increased
number of calls made using low stringency parameters, 86.3%
of these were concordant with the Illumina array call.

To further manipulate calling stringency, users can modify the
minimum and maximum sequence coverage required at a locus
to call a SNP. Decreasing the minimum coverage decreases the
false negative rate while increasing the false—positive rate through
undersampling of alleles. Increasing the minimum coverage
ameliorates this undersampling and thus improves the false posi—
tive rate, but also increases the false—negative rate (data not
shown). These results demonstrate how the choice of stringency
and genotype checking should be selected according to what type
of error structure is preferable, given the nature of the
experiment.

3.3 Run time and resources used

Number of samples and depth of sequence coverage had a
greater inﬂuence on run time than did total makers assayed
(Supplementary Fig. Sl). Eight minutes (min) and less than
120 MB of RAM from a single processor core at 3.07GHz
was required to genotype two samples at 6.5X at 5000 markers,
compared to 28.5 min for the same number of markers and
samples at 16X, or 56.5 min for 12 samples at 6.5X.

4 CONCLUSION

ArrayMaker provides a straightforward method of quickly ex—
tracting accurate SNP genotypes from BAM files at any
combination of SNP loci. The tool can replicate existing and
obsolete SNP array datasets, create GWAS—ready ﬁles from
bespoke marker lists, and rapidly genotype candidate SNP loci
in new samples without the need for complicated post—alignment
bioinformatics. It requires minimal computing time and
resources and is user—friendly, written in Perl to run on a
Linux platform with simple command—line operation. Only an
alignment, a reference genome sequence, a list of SNP markers
and SAMtools are required. Additional steps such as formatting
the marker list, including the conversion of legacy array datasets
into current reference genome coordinates or the ascertainment
of dataset—polymorphic SNPs for ﬁne mapping or candidate
variant analysis, may be required prior to the application of
ArrayMaker using alternate tools such as LiftOver or
SAMtools, respectively. Following its use, ArrayMaker data
can be readily interrogated with PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007)
for the determination of population allele frequencies, GWAS
and other useful analyses.

Simple, rapid and accurate genotyping-by-sequencing

 

Given the shift towards WGS in genetic research projects,
GBS is increasing in popularity and there are many existing
tools that return accurate genotypes from whole—genome
sequence data. However, calling and ﬁltering variants can be a
daunting computational task for those inexperienced in
bioinformatics. ArrayMaker simpliﬁes the task of extracting
SNP genotypes at prescribed loci by packaging a popular calling
algorithm with a light resource footprint into a user—friendly tool
that emits genotypes in a human—readable, GWAS—ready format.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Identifying causal variants remains a key challenge in post-
GWAS (genome-wide association study) era, as many GWAS single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (including imputed ones) fall into
non-coding regions, making it difficult to associate statistical
significance with predicted functionality. Therefore, we created a
web-based tool, Enlight, which overlays functional annotation informa-
tion, such as histone modification states, methylation patterns, tran-
scription factor binding sites, eQTL and higher-order chromosomal
structure, to GWAS results.

Availability and implementation: Accessible by a Web browser at

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enabled the identiﬁ-
cation of genetic variants associated with complex diseases and
traits. To date, there are 14012 genome-wide signiﬁcant variants
in the GWAS catalog (Hindorff et al., 2009). However, most of
the top hits are believed to be proxy markers for the underlying
causal variants, and the majority of those variants lie within non-
coding sequences (Maurano et al., 2012). Despite substantial ef-
forts in the post-GWAS era to identify causal variants, lack of
knowledge on biological functions has become a major hurdle
for differentiating causal variants from highly correlated tag
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

A large amount of biological annotation is now available for
non-coding sequences, given the community efforts devoted to
elucidating functional signiﬁcance of non-coding sequences in
the past few years. For example, the ENCODE project has sys-
tematically mapped regions of active transcription, transcription
factor (TF) association, chromatin structure and histone modiﬁ-
cation, and assigned at least one biochemical function to ~ 80%
of the genome (Bernstein et al., 2012). Recent studies showed
that disease-related variants detected by GWAS are signiﬁcantly
enriched in regions where regulatory elements are inferred, such
as DNase I hypersensitivity sites and TF binding sites (TFBS)
(Maurano et al., 2012; Schaub et al., 2012). Proper integration of
this biological information with GWAS results will likely shed

light on prioritization and identification of candidate causal vari-
ants (McCarthy and Hirschhorn, 2008).

To that end, tools such as HaploReg (Ward and Kellis, 2012),
RegulomeDB (Boyle et al., 2012), GWAS3D (Li et al., 2013) and
FunciSNP (Coetzee et al., 2012) were developed to leverage func-
tional annotations to interrogate GWAS variants. However,
users cannot Visually recognize the annotation patterns.

The popularity of regional plots highlights the importance of
Visual inspection of the GWAS results. Although LocusZoom
(Pruim et al., 2010) generates high-quality images showing
local linkage disequilibrium (LD) and association signiﬁcance,
it provides little information for interpreting non-coding vari-
ants. Therefore, we developed a web-based tool, Enlight, com-
bining biological annotation and GWAS-related information
into one single plot. It takes GWAS results (including imputed
ones) as input, and returns a regional plot with a variety of epi-
genetic information, such as histone modiﬁcation, methylation
patterns, TFBS, eQTL and higher-order chromosomal structure.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Architecture

The server backend is implemented in Perl CGI and MySQL.
Regional plots are performed by LocusZoom (Pruim et al.,
2010); annotation plots are performed by custom R and
Python code built on the basis of LocusZoom. Text annotation
is performed by ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010).

2.2 Input and output

The minimum input contains two columns: marker name (rsID)
and P-Value. Optionally, users can supply chromosome, start
position, end position, reference allele and alternative allele in
the ﬁrst five columns; if they are absent, Enlight converts marker
names to corresponding coordinates based on dbSNP137. On
submission, Enlight will output a conventional regional plot con-
taining association strength, LD information, gene position and
chromosomal recombination rate. Meanwhile, Enlight plots cat-
egorical annotations like chromHMM classiﬁcation as colored
stripes, continuous annotation such as histone modiﬁcation
states, DNA methylation signal, TF binding strength, etc., as
histograms, below the GWAS results panel (Fig. 1). Variants
that appear in the GWAS catalog and eQTL databases from
either GTEx project or eQTL browser of Pritchard Lab
(http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/) can be shown by a XYplot. Hi-C

Fig. 1. The association signals for rs2071278 and nearby loci from the
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) Rheumatoid
Arthritis study. The color stripe shows the chromHMM segmentation
result, which combines multiple epigenetic chromatin marks (legend
shown below). The three SNPs rs204991, rs204990 and rs204989 (all
yellow), which are in high LD with the reference SNP, show up in a
proposed enhancer region in blood cell lines, GM12878 and K562, but
not in non-blood cell lines, HepG2 or HSMM. The UChicago_eQTL
panel shows association signal based on data from eQTL browser at
the University of Chicago. The ngncodeRengbsClusteredV3 panel
summarizes a large collection of TF ChIP-seq results, and
tfbsConsSites panel describes TFBS conservation across human/mouse/
rat. Hi-C interaction plot is not shown

interaction (Lieberman-Aiden, et al., 2009) can be plotted as a
heatmap. Users are able to select data tracks from 14 cell lines
and 17 annotation types or plot with their own data in BED
format.

In addition to Visualization, Enlight generates text annotation
for each variant using ANNOVAR, which can be used for down-
stream analyses, such as ﬁnding biofeature overlap, regression
model building, etc.

Figure 1 shows a typical plot. rs2071278 is genome-wide sig-
niﬁcantly associated with serum complement C3 and C4 levels
Wang et al., 2012), important measurements in the assessment of
rheumatoid arthritis (Makinde et al., 1989). Therefore, rs2071278
is possibly a SNP tagging nearby functional variants. For in-
stance, rs20499l, rs204990 and rs204989, all in high LD with
rs2071278 (1000 genomes, European population, 2012), are
shown to be signiﬁcantly associated with expression of human
leukocyte antigen genes by microarray (Zeller et al., 2010). This

finding partly explains their strong associations with rheumatoid
arthritis in the WTCCC study (Wellcome Trust Case Control,
2007). When strong associations appear near known GWAS hits
and are surrounded by interesting epigenetic and other func-
tional features, they perhaps suggest functional importance.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We have created a user-friendly tool to generate regional plots of
association results with biological annotation as well as text an-
notation for individual variant. Enlight makes it possible to Visu-
ally connect epigenetic features or other functional annotations
with the LD information, thus facilitating the identiﬁcation of
putative causal variants. Enlight can be accessed Via a web-based
interface.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Sample mix-ups can arise during sample collection,
handling, genotyping or data management. It is unclear how often
sample mix-ups occur in genome-wide studies, as there currently
are no post hoc methods that can identify these mix-ups in unrelated
samples. We have therefore developed an algorithm (MixupMapper)
that can both detect and correct sample mix-ups in genome-wide
studies that study gene expression levels.

Results: We applied MixupMapper to five publicly available human
genetical genomics datasets. On average, 3% of all analyzed
samples had been assigned incorrect expression phenotypes: in
one of the datasets 23% of the samples had incorrect expression
phenotypes. The consequences of sample mix-ups are substantial:
when we corrected these sample mix-ups, we identified on
average 15% more significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci
(cis-eQTLs). In one dataset, we identified three times as many
significant cis-eQTLs after correction. Furthermore, we show through
simulations that sample mix-ups can lead to an underestimation
of the explained heritability of complex traits in genome-wide
association datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide studies have identiﬁed many disease-associated
variants for a wide plethora of complex human diseases (Hindorff
et (11., 2009) [such as celiac disease (Dubois et (11., 2010), type
1 diabetes (Barrett et (11., 2009) and type 2 diabetes (Voight
et (11., 2010), Crohn’s disease (Franke et (11., 2010)], and complex
continuous phenotypes [such as lipid levels (Teslovich et (11.,

2010), body mass index (BMI) (Speliotes et (11., 2010) and height
(Lango Allen et (11., 2010)]. Many of these studies (Dubois
et (11., 2010; Voight et (11., 2010; Teslovich et (11., 2010; Speliotes
et (11., 2010; Lango Allen et (11., 2010) also assess the effect of
the identiﬁed genetic variants on gene expression variation [i.e.
genetical genomics (Jansen and Nap, 2001)], by mapping expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL). As such, these studies involve many
steps before actual analysis of the data, during each of which samples
could be accidentally swapped. Since these studies are pushing
toward larger sample-sizes in order to be able to identify ever
smaller effects, the presence of sample mix-ups becomes almost
unavoidable.

It is known from simulations that sample mix-ups can have an
effect on the power to detect genetic associations in genome-wide
studies (Buyske et (11., 2009; Gordon and Finch, 2004; Ho and Lange,
2010; Samuels et (11., 2009; Zheng and Tian, 2005), which may
present a problem to detect variants with small effects. However, it
is unclear how often such sample mix-ups actually occur in studies
investigating gene expression. The common method to detect sample
mix-ups in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is to Check
for heterozygous genotypes for X-Chromosomal markers in males.
However, this procedure will not identify sample mix-ups between
samples of identical gender. While it is also possible to use multiple
phenotypes that can be well predicted based on genetic markers
[such as eye color and hair color (Sulem et (11., 2007) and ABO
blood group (Yip, 2002)], we are not aware of any study where
this has been applied to identify sample mix-ups in GWAS. It
is obvious that if there would be a considerable number of such
phenotypes available, identiﬁcation of nearly all sample mix-ups
should become feasible. Another method to prevent sample mix-
ups that is commonly used in GWA studies involves the genotyping
of a small number of variants prior to hybridization to the Chip. Post
hoc concordance analysis then allows to resolve mixed-up

samples, although this method does not resolve mix-ups that
might have been introduced during phenotyping. Although these
methods are tailored for GWAS, they are also applicable to genetical
genomics datasets. This however does not apply to gene expression
data, for which to our knowledge no methods to detect sample
mix-ups currently exist.

Our method (MixupMapper) uses gene expression levels for
genes, which are inﬂuenced by genetic variation located near these
genes (cis-eQTLs). On the basis of such cis-eQTL effects, our

method measures the difference between actual gene expression
levels and predicted expression levels that are solely based
on genotype data of cis-SNPs. Using this distance measure,
MixupMapper is able to detect and correct sample mix-ups with
high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. In this study, we analyzed ﬁve
publicly available human genome-wide studies on gene expression
and observe that sample mix-ups are frequent. Subsequently, we
show that correcting sample mix-ups can yield a substantial increase
in the number of signiﬁcant cis-eQTLs. Furthermore, we show
through simulations that sample mix-ups have large effects in GWAS
as well, when detecting genome-wide signiﬁcant associations, which
may account for a considerable proportion of the missing heritability
problem that affects many current GWAS studies (Manolio et (11.,
2009)

2 METHODS

Datasets: we used ﬁve genetical genomics studies (Choy at (11.. 2008;
Heinzen at (11.. 2008; Stranger at (11.. 2007; Webster at (11.. 2009; Zhang
et (11.. 2009) to assess the prevalence of sample mix-ups (Table 1). To our
knowledge. this list includes all publicly available datasets that include both
genome-wide genotype and gene expression data (as of October 2010). For
the various HapMap datasets (Choy 21111.. 2008; Zhang 21111.. 2009; Stranger
at (11.. 2007) we conﬁned ourselves to the 309 565 SNPs present on the
commonly used Illumina HumanHap300 platform (to limit the number of
calculations). The studies that investigated samples from the HapMap project
concentrated on the Central European (CEU). Chinese (CHB). Japanese
(JPT) and Yoruban (YRI) populations. We combined the CHB and JPT
populations since their sample sizes were very small and both reﬂect Asian
samples. As such. we analyzed three sample sets for the studies that used
HapMap samples (CEU. CHB+JPT and YRI) for the datasets of Stranger
et a1. (2007) and Choy et a1. (2008). We analyzed two sets of samples for
Zhang et al.’s (2009) dataset as they had only investigated the CEU and YRI
subpopulations. The dataset from Heinzen et a1. (2008) consisted of two
separate sets of samples from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
and brain tissue that were analyzed separately. Finally. we included a dataset
on brain tissue samples from Webster et a1. (2009). We also assessed a liver
dataset from Wolfs.M.G. et al. (unpublished data) but did not include eQTL
mapping results. as this dataset was not published as a genetical genomics
dataset before.

Table 1. Analyzed genetical genomics datasets

Cis-eQTL mapping: for the sample mix-up analysis. we performed an
initial cis-eQTL analysis on each dataset. Although we expected the presence
of sample mix-ups to have a large effect on the ability to detect cis-
eQTLs. we assumed this inﬂuence was limited for the cis-eQTLs with the
strongest effects. Gene expression datasets were quantile normalized and
log transformed. if appropriate. prior to eQTL mapping. C is-eQTL mapping
was performed by using Spearman rank correlations (minor allele frequency
(MAF) >5%. Hardy7Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) P-Value 3 0.0001. SNP
call-rate 395%). Only those SNP-probe pairs were tested that were within a
Vicinity of 250 kilobases (kb). Multiple testing correction was performed
by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05 by permuting the
phenotype to genotype sample labels [swapping sample phenotype labels.
thus preserving the correlation structure within both the genotype and
expression data (Breitling at (11.. 2008)] and re-running the eQTL mapping
1000 times. The numbers of cis-eQTLs that we have reported here refer to
the numbers of unique probes that show a H's-association. It is important
to note that we did not correct for any potentially false-positive cis-eQTLs
caused by primer polymorphisms within the expression probe because they
actually assist in determining the correct correspondence between genotype
and gene expression data. This approach was applied to all cis-eQTL mapping
procedures in this study. unless speciﬁed otherwise.

Identifying sample mix-ups: the concept behind our method to identify
sample mix-ups is straightforward: for some genes. the expression level is
very strongly determined by a SNP genotype. For a pair of genotype and gene
expression arrays. we can determine the concordance between the expected
gene expression level conditional on the putative SNP genotype for such
genes (Fig. 1C). By systematically assessing all sample pairs with such a
set of cis-eQTLs. we can determine which pairs are likely to be correct and
which pairs are not. In general. there are several scenarios for errors in sample
assignment. These include duplicate genotypes. duplicate expression arrays.
absent genotypes. absent expression arrays and sample swaps. We considered
each of these scenarios indicative of a sample mix-up. We deﬁned the total
number of sample mix-ups as the number of genotyped samples that have
had an incorrect expression array assigned.

To identify sample mix-ups. MixupMapper uses each signiﬁcantly
detected cis-eQTL in the dataset. For each of these cis-eQTLs we determined
the mean (uAA. [LAB and uBB) and standard deviation (0AA. O'AB and
01313) of the gene expression values for each of the three genotypes (AA.
AB and BB). For this purpose we used the genotype and gene expression
pairs that were initially assumed to be correct. For each pair of genotype and
gene expression array we determined the SNP genotype (g). We calculated
the number of standard deviations that the gene expression value (2) differed

Fig. 1. (A) We observed numerous sample mix-ups in a dataset created by our laboratory (Wolfs.M.G. at (11.. unpublished data). where the chromosome Y
expression did not correspond to the genotype-derived sex (indicated with asterisk). (B) Four plots of cis-eQTLs mapped in the dataset from Wolfs.M.G.
et al. showed samples 36 and 52 as outliers. These samples generally deviated more from the expected regression line than the other samples in this dataset
(samples 36 and 52 highlighted). If this was a general observation over all signiﬁcant cis-eQTLs for this dataset. we gathered evidence that something was
wrong with these samples. (C) Therefore. for each cis-eQTL. we calculated the mean gene expression level (11) and standard deviation (:7) per genotype
(g). This allowed us to determine. per individual (i). to what extent the gene expression level (2,») was deviating from the regression line using an absolute
Z-scorei 2 la, — ugil/agi. Samples 36 and 52 generally have a higher Z-score compared to other samples. By repeating these calculations for all signiﬁcant
cis-eQTLs. and by comparing all pairs of gene expression arrays and genotyping arrays. we could identify those samples that were likely to be mixed-up. (D)
When we corrected these mix-ups we observed that the chromosome Y expression now corresponded to the sex for most samples: sample mix-ups resolved.
(E) Inspection of the RNA plate layout indicated that mix-ups had been introduced by pipetting mistakes.

from the expected value associated with the SNP genotype using an absolute
Z-score (1).
Z = w (1)
Us

For each sample pair we summed the absolute Z-scores of all signiﬁcant
cis-eQTLs and determined the average Z-score for each sample pair to
account for differences in the number of tested eQTLs per sample pair due
to missing SNP genotypes.

Expression arrays that have been hybridized to lower quality or degraded
RNA tend to result in higher deviations from the individual cis-eQTL
regression lines. irrespective of what genotyped sample has been tested for
such an expression array. As a result. such an expression sample will show
higher overall Z-scores on average for each of the genotyped samples to
which it is compared. Therefore. in order to standardize the Z-scores for
each of the expression arrays. we normalized the Z-scores by subtracting
the average of the overall Z-scores for this expression sample and divided it
by the standard deviation of the overall Z-scores for this expression sample.
Similarly. we normalized the Z-scores by subtracting the average of the
overall Z-scores for this genotype sample and divided it by the standard
deviation of the overall Z -sc0res for the genotype sample.

After these normalizations we determined what the expression array was
with the lowest overall normalized Z-score for each genotyped sample. We
considered this expression sample to reﬂect this particular genotyped sample.

Once the best matching expression sample had been identiﬁed for each
genotyped sample. we compared it to what had been initially deﬁned.
permitting us to identify which samples were mixed-up.

It is. however. also conceivable that our method might incorrectly suggest
the presence of sample mix-ups. because of potential overﬁtting of mean
and standard deviations for each of the three genotype groups per cis-eQTL.
We therefore used a post hoc permutation strategy to check if our results
were not due to overﬁtting. We ﬁrst permuted the phenotype labels and
subsequently ran a cis-eQTL analysis. As expected. this analysis did not
lead to the identiﬁcation of any signiﬁcant cis-eQTL. although it did permit
us to identify the list of top cis-eQTLs for this permutation. We chose an
equal number of cis-eQTLs as identiﬁed in the initial cis-eQTL analysis
(that was based on the non-permuted data). Using this set of cis-eQTLs
and the permuted phenotype labels. we then performed the sample mix-up
identiﬁcation procedure. This resulted in overall Z -sc0res for each genotype-
expression sample pair and a respective distribution that indicated what could
be expected when running the mix-up procedure on randomly permuted data.
Based on this distribution. we determined the 5th percentile Z -sc0re threshold

(low Z-Values indicating a better agreement). We repeated this permutation
strategy 1000 times. resulting in a distribution of 5th percentile Z-score
thresholds. We decided to select the 5th percentile Z -sc0re threshold as what
was attained in only 5% of the 1000 permutations. Using this strategy we
determined a Z-score signiﬁcance threshold for each of the datasets. We used
this threshold for each of the inferred sample mix-ups and only considered
the mix-ups signiﬁcant and real if the mix-up Z-score was lower than the
Z-score signiﬁcance threshold.

Once we had determined the best match for each genotype array. we used
the following procedure to decide which genotyped samples to keep. which
to correct. and which to remove completely:

(1) For each genotyped sample we ﬁrst checked if the overall Z-score of
the best matching gene expression array was below the permutation
Z-score threshold (a lower Z-score corresponds to a better match).
We discarded the genotyped sample completely if no well-matched
gene expression sample was identiﬁed.

(2

V

For each of the remaining genotyped samples. we checked if the best
matching gene expression array corresponded to the one that was
originally considered to match it. If they corresponded. this indicated
that the sample had not been mixed-up and it would be kept.

(3

V

For those genotyped samples with an incorrect gene expression array.
we applied the following procedure:

0 We ﬁrst determined what other genotyped sample was originally
coupled to that particular gene expression array. If that other
genotype sample was not considered a mix-up and thus matched the
particular gene expression array well. we knew we had to discard
the genotype sample that we were assessing.

0 Alternatively. if the other genotype sample did not correlate well
with the gene expression array. we knew we could safely assign the
assessed genotyped sample to this gene expression array. because
the other genotype sample was likely to be assigned to another well
matching expression sample.

(4

V

Finally. to ensure that each gene expression array was eventually
assigned to a single genotype array. we checked whether there were
two genotype samples that were assigned to the same gene expression
sample. If this was the case. we discarded the genotype sample that
was the worse match to the expression array (i.e. the one with the
highest Z-score).

Using this method. we were able to not only correct for sample mix-ups. but
also to identify those genotype arrays that clearly did not match any gene
expression arrays. Such genotype samples generally had a worse Z-score
than those genotype samples that matched a gene expression array well and
they were discarded from further analyses.

Eﬁ‘ects of sample mix-ups in genetical genomics studies: we assessed the
effect of sample mix-ups in each of the assessed datasets by repeating the cis-
eQTL mapping after we had corrected the sample mix-ups. We also simulated
the effect of accidental sample mix-ups in the datasets in which we had
not identiﬁed any mix-ups. The samples were permuted with increments
of ~5%. after which we performed cis-eQTL mapping (FDR<0.05. 100
permutations). We repeated this analysis 100 times to get an accurate estimate
of the average number of signiﬁcantly detected cis-eQTLs for the different
sets of increasingly mixed-up samples.

Sensitivity and speciﬁcity of sample mix-up method: for the datasets where
we had deliberately introduced sample mix-ups. we ascertained how many of
these mix-ups could be identiﬁed by our method to get realistic estimates on
its speciﬁcity and sensitivity. We deﬁned the true positives (TP) as the number
of mixed-up samples that our method had correctly identiﬁed. However. we
also required that the method had identiﬁed the correct alternative expression
sample. We deﬁned the false positives (FP) as the number of samples that
were either falsely deemed to be a mix-up. or that were mixed-up but
not assigned to the correct alternative expression sample. We deﬁned the
true negatives (TN) as the number of samples correctly identiﬁed as not

being mixed-up. This permitted us to determine the true positive rate (TPR.
sensitivity) as: TPR = TP/(Number of introduced mix-ups). and the false
positive rate (FPR) as: FPR = FP/(TN + FP). We deﬁned the speciﬁcity as 1
7 FPR.

Efects of sample mix-ups on GWAS that looked at one particular,
continuous, phenotype: we simulated the effect of sample mix-ups on GWAS
that investigated one particular. continuous. phenotype by ﬁrst generating
genotypes for a population of 500 000 individuals. each with a minor allele
frequency (MAF) of 0.5. On the basis of these genotypes. we then generated
a random continuous phenotype. based on an error term and the joint effect
of 100. 200 or 500 unlinked SNPs (each having an equal effect size). and we
assumed that each of these causal variants had been successfully genotyped.
Using this method. we created phenotypes that were respectively 90. 80.
70. 60 and 50% heritable. From this population. we then randomly sampled
10000 samples. and conducted an association analysis. We correlated the
phenotype to the genotype using Pearson correlation coefﬁcients. By using a
P-Value threshold of 5 X 10‘8. which is commonly used to declare genome-
wide signiﬁcance. we were able to determine what proportion of the causative
variants were signiﬁcant. By repeating this procedure 1000 times. we
obtained reliable estimates of how many of the variants were declared
signiﬁcant. We then repeated this procedure while swapping the phenotypes
of an increasing number of individuals. to ascertain the effect of sample
mix-ups.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Identifying sample mix-ups

The issue of sample mix-ups became apparent in a genetical
genomics dataset of liver tissue that had been generated in our
laboratory, as there were various samples for which the chromosome
Y expression did not correspond to the gender as derived from the
genotypes (Wolfs,M.G. et (11., unpublished data; Fig. 1A).

To identify the exact origin of these sample mix-ups we developed
a sample mix-up algorithm (MixupMapper) that relies upon gene
expression phenotypes that are inﬂuenced by genetic variation
(cis-eQTLs). Figure 1B shows four cis-eQTL plots from this dataset
in which samples 36 and 52 have been highlighted. These samples
generally deviate substantially from the cis-eQTL regression line
(Fig. 1C), suggesting they have been swapped.

By applying our mix-up identiﬁcation method to all pairs of
genotyped and gene expression samples, we were able to identify 28
sample mix-ups in this dataset (Fig. 1D). These mix-ups were later
conﬁrmed by the facility involved in generating the data: when we
compared the results to the plate layout of the RNA samples used
during pipetting, we observed that some columns had been swapped
and some rows had been inverted after hybridization to the gene
expression chip (Fig. 1E). We should note that the actual mix-up of
samples can have occurred during any of the steps involved in the
generation of this dataset, such as during DNA and RNA isolation,
aliquoting and hybridization. However, these samples appeared to
be mixed-up because of pipetting mistakes prior to hybridization on
the RNA-chip, as we did not observe any indications of errors that
occurred in the DNA preparation or hybridization process. In total,
30 out of 74 samples (41%) had been assigned wrong expression
phenotypes and our method was able to resolve 28 of them.

3.2 Sample mix-ups in published datasets

As we had identiﬁed these mix-ups in our own data, we applied
our method to ﬁve publicly available human datasets for which
both genotype and gene expression data was freely available online

3In four out of the ﬁve studies, sample mix-ups were present in some of the populations investigated by the authors. In a substantial number of cases, these sample mix-ups could
be resolved if, for instance, we assumed that two expression samples had been accidentally swapped. Genotyped samples for which no appropriate expression sample could be

identiﬁed were removed. Numbers of cis-eQTLs are number of unique probes with an signiﬁcant effect (FDR<0.05). NA, not applicable.

2007; Webster et (11 ., 2009; Zhang et (11 ., 2009). Four out of these ﬁve
datasets contained sample mix-ups (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S1
and Table S1) and observed that for 3% of all samples, the genotype
and expression data did not correspond (41 out of 1238 samples).
The number of sample mix-ups was highest in the CHB+JPT subset
from Choy et (11. (2008): out of 87 samples, 20 were incorrect (23%).
In total, we were able to correct 21 of the 41 samples that had an
incorrect expression phenotype.

We assessed whether the identiﬁed mix-ups were not due to
extreme expression levels (e.g. because of hybridization problems
that lead to poor normalization) or bad-quality genotypes. For
this purpose, we assessed the variability of all genotype and gene
expression samples within each dataset using principal component
analysis (PCA) on the sample correlation matrix: samples that are
clear outliers in terms of sample quality, show deviations for the
ﬁrst two principal components (PCs). To test whether the identiﬁed
sample mix-ups deviated from the remaining samples, we performed
a Wilcoxon—Mann—Whitney test on the eigenvalues for these PCs.
As we did not observe any signiﬁcant differences (Bonferroni
correction P<0.004), we can conclude that sample quality does
not confound the results of our method (Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.3 Sensitivity and speciﬁcity

We established that our method is highly speciﬁc and sensitive, by
conducting simulations in the datasets in which no mix-ups had
been identiﬁed (Fig. 2A). We observed the best performance in the
Stranger et (11. (2007) CHB+JPT dataset: even when 40% of the
samples had been mixed-up, 98% ((72: 3%) of these ‘errors’ could
still be successfully identiﬁed and successﬁilly corrected. The worst
performance was observed in the Heinzen et (11. (2008) post-mortem
brain dataset: when 10% of the samples in this dataset were mixed-
up, only 85% ((72: 15%) of these could be successfully identiﬁed
and corrected. Very few samples were wrongly deemed a sample
mix-up by our method, indicating our method is highly speciﬁc for
each of the datasets in which 10% of the samples had been mixed-up,

we observed only rarely that non-mixed-up samples were wrongly
deemed to be mixed-up (Speciﬁcity >99.9%, Fig. 2A).

3.4 Effect of correcting sample mix-ups on the number
of detected cis-eQTLs

Table 2 shows that the number of detected cis-eQTLs increased in
each of the datasets after we had corrected for the sample mix-ups
(Table 2 and Supplementary Figs S3, S4A—S4F, FDR< 0.05, 1000
permutations). In total, 15% more cis-eQTLs were identiﬁed for
these datasets. For the CHB+JPT population from Choy et (11. (2008),
correcting the identiﬁed mix-ups increased the number of signiﬁcant
cis-eQTLs by 203% (418 cis-eQTLs compared to 138 cis-eQTLs
before correction). This is a considerable increase, especially since
the effective sample size decreased by 9% (79 samples included
after correction compared to 87 samples in the original dataset).
Furthermore, this indicated that the removed samples effectively
amounted to noise and therefore contributed to a decrease in the
power to detect cis-eQTL effects, especially smaller ones. However,
the increase in the number of detected cis-eQTLs we describe
here could also be explained by an increase of the proportion of
false positives that are the result of SNPs being present in the
gene expression probe sequences, directly affecting hybridization
efﬁciency (Benovoy et (11., 2008). We therefore checked whether the
proportion of potential false positives due to probe polymorphisms
differed before and after sample mix-up correction for each dataset
and found no differences in the assessed datasets (Supplementary
Fig. S5).

3.5 Replication of detected cis-eQTLs

We reasoned that we could gain further evidence that the identiﬁed
sample mix-ups were indeed mix-ups by replicating the cis-eQTLs
that were identiﬁed after the correction. It has been shown that
substantial overlap exists in cis-eQTL effects between different
populations and also between different tissues (Bullaughey et (11.,
2009; Heap et (11., 2009; Stranger et (11., 2007). We therefore
compared the datasets that had been run on the same expression
platform, which amounts to comparing the different HapMap

Proportion of samples with induced incorrect expression phenotypes

Fig. 2. (A) Robustness analyses on the sample mix-up identiﬁcation method shows that if the fraction of mixed-up samples is <25%. most of the sample
mix-ups are detected and corrected by our method with high speciﬁcity and sensitivity. Variability is generally low (shaded areas around graphs). especially for
the speciﬁcity. (B) Sample mix-ups were introduced into the six datasets that did not initially contain any mix-ups. Deliberately introducing sample mix-ups
resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of signiﬁcantly detectable cis-eQTLs (FDR < 0.05). If 3% of the samples had an incorrect phenotype assigned.

populations. For the studies of Choy et (11. (2008), Zhang et (11.
and Stranger et (11. (2007), we assessed number of the signiﬁcantly
detected cis-eQTLs in one HapMap population that had also
been detected in another HapMap population (Supplementary
Fig. S6). After correcting the sample mix-ups, the number of shared
cis-eQTLs increased in each of the population comparisons. A
total of 99.7% of the eQTLs that were shared between at least
two populations showed identical allelic directions. We observed
comparable increases in shared cis-eQTLs after mix-up correction,
when comparing identical HapMap populations that had been run
on different expression platforms (Supplementary Fig. S7).

3.6 Effect of sample mix-ups on GWAS studies on
continuous traits

We systematically explored the effect of different proportions of
sample mix-ups on the power to detect cis-eQTLs. We investigated
the datasets in which we had not identiﬁed any sample mix-ups and
deliberately introduced sample mix-ups by swapping the expression
array measurements for an increasing number of samples. We
observed a considerable decrease of, on average, 13% when only
3% of the samples were deliberately mixed-up (Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, we decided to model the inﬂuence of sample mix-
ups on GWAS studies that investigate traits caused by hundreds of
variants, such as height or body mass index. We simulated a trait with
several degrees of heritability and different numbers of causative
variants in a population of 500 000 individuals. From this population
we randomly sampled 10 000 individuals on which we conducted a
linear regression analysis and determined the percentage of SNPs
that were genome-wide signiﬁcant (P < 510—8, Fig. 3A). To measure

the effect of sample mix-ups, we then deliberately randomized the
trait measurements of an increasing number of randomly selected
individuals (Fig. 3B and 3C).

A very limited number of sample mix-ups had severe
consequences for traits that have a heritability of 50%, of which the
heritable fraction is due to 500 causal variants. If 3% of all samples
had an incorrect phenotype (as observed in the genetical genomics
datasets), we could only signiﬁcantly detect 77% of the causal
variants that we would have identiﬁed if no mix-ups had been present
(at P < 5 X 10_8, Fig. 3B). Likewise, we observed a decrease in the
proportion of the heritability that could be explained by the genome-
wide signiﬁcant associations (Fig. 3C): the explained heritability of
genome-wide signiﬁcant variants decreased with 1.24-fold (from
3.7% to 2.8%) when 3% of the samples were mixed-up.

If these sample mix-ups could be detected and corrected, it would
be possible to explain 1.24-fold more of the heritability for such
traits. Methods to detect such sample mix-ups therefore have the
potential to substantially increase the explained heritability and
power to detect genetic effects in GWAS on complex phenotypes
such as height, BMI or some diseases.

4 DISCUSSION

We have identiﬁed sample mix-ups in four out of ﬁve genetical
genomics studies by applying a novel method (MixupMapper).
On average, 3% of all samples were mixed-up. After correction
for these sample mix-ups by our method, we detected on average
15% more cis-eQTLs. Correcting mix-ups in one dataset in which
23% of the samples were incorrect led to three times as many
signiﬁcant cis-eQTLs being detected. The consequences of only

for a 50% heritable trait caused by 500 unlinked variants. (C) Likewise we observed a substantial loss in the explained heritable proportion.

3% sample mix-ups on the heritable fraction that can be explained
by signiﬁcantly associated variants can also be substantial. For
some simulated complex traits with a moderate to high heritability,
the explained heritability of the genome-wide signiﬁcant variants
increased 1.24-fold, when these sample mix-ups could be detected
and corrected.

A considerable proportion of the heritability of complex diseases
and traits is currently ‘missing’. There is debate on whether the
missing heritability problem is caused by rare variants with a large
effect, by many more common variants, each with a very small effect
size, by overestimation of the heritability estimates or through other
means (Manolio et (11., 2009; McCarthy and Hirschhom, 2008). As
current genome-wide studies are pushing toward associating ever
smaller effect sizes, sample sizes have to increase substantially
to discover loci with smaller effect sizes (Park et (11., 2010). Our
results indicate that especially for these small-effect size loci, sample
mix-ups could have consequences on the power to detect such loci
for both genetical genomics studies as well as GWAS. As such, a
proportion of the missing heritability could possibly be explained
by the presence of sample mix-ups in genome-wide datasets.

However, it remains a question whether the frequency of sample
mix-ups we observed in genetical genomics samples is a realistic
estimate for other types of genome-wide datasets. Different types
of genome-wide datasets require many different handling steps,
and therefore their frequencies for the presence of sample mix-
ups may differ. For example for case—control GWAS the cases and
controls are often collected and processed separately from each
other. Therefore, the frequency and hence the consequence of sample
mix-ups in such case—control studies might be lower compared to
the studies presented here. As such, GWAS in general might contain
fewer sample mix-ups.

In the case of genetical genomics datasets, more cis-eQTLs could
be detected in each of the datasets after correction, although the
number of included samples had actually decreased for three of
these datasets. This effectively demonstrates that increasing the
sample size is not the only way of increasing statistical power
for determining complex traits; increasing the phenotypic accuracy
can be equally helpful. In addition to the method described here,
phenotypic accuracy may be increased by, for example, including
relevant co-variates in GWAS, or by using principal components

analysis in cis-eQTL studies (Dubois et (11., 2010; Leek and
Storey, 2007). Although these methods are helpful in increasing
the phenotypic accuracy, they do not help to identify or overcome
sample mix-ups.

One possible problem with MixupMapper is that it depends on an
initial set of cis-eQTLs that can be detected in the data. Although
our method generally shows high sensitivity and speciﬁcity when
large proportions of samples are mixed-up, in an extreme scenario,
where all genotyped samples are randomly assigned to the gene
expression samples, the mix-ups cannot be resolved since no cis-
eQTLs will be initially detectable. However, if a set of cis-eQTLs
has been independently identiﬁed in another set of samples for the
particular expression platform used, it is also be possible to resolve
these problems (data not shown).

We feel it is important to emphasize that the sample mix-ups that
we detected in the ﬁve public datasets do not in any way discredit
these studies. To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to describe a method
to identify mix-ups for these kinds of datasets. If the authors had
been aware of the existence of these mix-ups, they would have
certainly corrected them, as their goal was to ﬁnd as many eQTLs
as possible. Since we observed a substantial overlap of detected
cis-eQTLs in the three HapMap populations before correction of
sample mix-ups, we assume the detected cis-eQTLs in these datasets
are still valid. We are convinced that the results and conclusions
drawn from these datasets (Choy et (11., 2008; Heinzen et (11., 2008;
Stranger et (11., 2007; Webster et (11., 2009; Zhang et (11., 2009) remain
appropriate.

Although our method is intended for genetical genomics datasets,
it can also be applied to other types of genome-wide datasets, as long
as there are sufﬁcient numbers of different phenotypes available per
individual that are each (strongly) determined by genetic variants or
combinations of variants. This requirement will likely be met with
the growing interest in population-based cohort studies in which
hundreds of phenotypes are collected from the participants. As a
consequence, identifying sample mix-ups will then become possible
for these datasets as well.

Our results clearly indicate that sample mix-ups occur in many
laboratories (including ours). Although a great deal of quality
control is conducted in GWAS, it is very difﬁcult to prevent
the accidental mislabeling of some samples. This is particularly
problematic in studies of unrelated individuals where inheritance
patterns cannot be investigated. Nevertheless, these accidental
human mistakes or experimental problems can sometimes have far-
reaching consequences. We therefore recommend rigorous quality
control of the laboratory and administrative processes in order to
prevent sample mix-ups from happening. We conclude that fewer
sample mix-ups will increase the power to detect signiﬁcant genetic
associations substantially and might resolve a part of the missing
heritability.

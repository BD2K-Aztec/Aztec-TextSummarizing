In the basic setting, BETAWARE works in two steps. First, it predicts
with N-to-l ELM a score for a protein to be a TMBB. Therefore, in case
the protein is predicted as TMBB, it assigns the putative topology using
the GRHCRF. The output includes the sequence name present in the
FASTA ﬁle, the sequence length, the TMBB prediction (yes or no) and
possibly the topology prediction. When the topology is assigned, the
output also displays the posterior probability of the label for each se-
quence position (from ‘a’ 2 highest probability to ‘j’ 2 lowest probability,
see output example). BETAWARE allows a more advanced control using
directly the python script betaware .py. In this case, several options are
possible, such as forcing the prediction of the topology even if the detec-
tion program does not recognize the sequence as a TMBB (-t option),
changing the threshold for allowing a more or less stringent detection
criterion (-s option), changing the order of the sequence proﬁle columns
(the order of the residues in the sequence proﬁle, -a option) and directing
the output on a ﬁle (-o option).

3 BETAWARE PERFORMANCE

It has been shown that BETAWARE is one of the best—perform—
ing methods on the problem of the detection of TMBB in large
set of proteins (Savojardo et al., 2011). This is also confirmed
when it is compared with more recent approaches achieving a
Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient and a Fl—score of 0.82 and
0.81, respectively (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary
Material). In particular, BETAWARE appears effective in redu—
cing the number of false positive predictions as compared with
other available methods, as indicated by the positive predicted
value (PPV) of 0.92 (Supplementary Table S1). The same picture
holds also when BETAWARE is applied to genome analyses
(Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Material).

The number of TMMBs available at atomic resolution
increased since we introduced the predictor based on GRHCRF
(Fariselli, 2009). Here, we retrain the BETAWARE—topology
component on a larger set of proteins (for more detail see BTM
in Supplementary Material). BTM is a dataset consisting of 54
non—redundant TMBB structures (and topology) obtained by
merging OPM (Lomize et al., 2006) and PDBTM (Tusnady
et al., 2005). BETAWARE performance in cross—validation on
BTM is reported in Table 1. Compared with previous results on
a smaller dataset (Fariselli et al., 2009), the overall accuracy is
lower. This is probably owing to the fact that BTM contains
more difﬁcult topologies, and it is conﬁrmed by the fact that
when BETAWARE is trained and tested in cross—validation on
a more recent, but smaller, dataset (BOCTOPUSset), its

performance is comparable with those obtained by the best—per—
forming methods on this task as indicated by a protein overlap of
0.72 (Supplementary Table S2).

4 CONCLUSION

In this application notes, we present BETAWARE, a stand—
alone program that can detect with high reliability TMBBs in
large sets of proteins and that furnishes a state—of—the—art per—
formance in the task of the prediction of TMBB topology. The
program can be installed on a Linux—based machine and can be
used in—house for wide—screening applications.

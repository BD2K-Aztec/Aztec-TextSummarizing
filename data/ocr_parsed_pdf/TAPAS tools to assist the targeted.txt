ABSTRACT

Motivation: In proteomes of higher eukaryotes, many alternative
splice variants can only be detected by their shared peptides. This
makes it highly challenging to use peptide-centric mass spectrometry
to distinguish and to quantify protein isoforms resulting from alterna-
tive splicing events.

Results: We have developed two complementary algorithms based
on linear mathematical models to efficiently compute a minimal set of
shared and unique peptides needed to quantify a set of isoforms and
splice variants. Further, we developed a statistical method to estimate
the splice variant abundances based on stable isotope labeled peptide
quantities. The algorithms and databases are integrated in a
web-based tool, and we have experimentally tested the limits of our
quantification method using spiked proteins and cell extracts.

1 INTRODUCTION

Higher eukaryotic proteomes have greatly expanded during
evolution by the variation created by alternatively spliced
forms of the same gene, duplication into orthologous genes
and differentially processed proteins (Nilsen and Graveley,
2010; Rappsilber and Mann, 2002). These multiple protein iso-
forms play significant roles in differentiation, development and
disease (Irimia and Blencowe, 2012; Maniatis and Tasic, 2002).
High-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and mass spectrom-
etry (MS) technologies have facilitated the genome-wide identi-
ﬁcation of alternative splicing (Nagaraj et al., 2011; Pan et al.,
2008). It was shown that shifts in the relative splice transcript
abundance between different cells and tissues are more
frequently observed than all-or-none switch-like behaviors
(Shen et al., 2012). Thus, knowing the amount of an expressed
splice variant is highly desirable to understand cellular functions.

Peptide-centric high-throughput shotgun MS approaches have
achieved remarkable detection coverage (Nagaraj et al., 2011).
However, inferring protein isoform identities and estimating

their abundances by peptide-centric shotgun MS is not straight-
forward, as many peptides are shared between isoforms
(Nesvizhskii and Aebersold, 2005). Recently, statistical methods
have addressed these problems by using both unique and shared
peptides (Blein—Nicolas et al., 2012; Dost et al., 2012; Gerster
et al., 2014). While these methods have improved protein
quantiﬁcations from peptide intensities, they were not speciﬁcally
designed for a targeted MS approach of isoform analysis. In this
work, we developed efﬁcient computational optimization tech-
niques to infer a minimal list of unique and shared peptides
needed to accurately quantify a set of isoforms. This algorithm
is integrated in a web-based tool (TAPAS) that assists in the
design of stable isotope labeled (SIL) peptides for targeted MS
experiments.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

TAPAS has been implemented using Django, a web framework
based on the Python programming language. With this software,
the user will be able to retrieve the optimal experimental design
and estimates for absolute protein abundances for a selected set
of splicing variants of interest motivated from a speciﬁc biolo-
gical problem (Fig. 1).

Experimental design: TAPAS generates lists of unique and
shared peptides that can be used in SIL—based targeted proteo-
mics approaches to quantify selected alternative spliced variants.
The peptides are specific for one or more input genes, but are not
shared with other genes to avoid non-speciﬁcity. TAPAS uses
two complementary algorithms, recursive set subtraction and
Gaussian elimination to generate a minimal combination of pep-
tides required for quantifying each splice variant or a group of
splice variants (Supplementary Material). Furthermore, TAPAS
provides additional information to the user such that suitable
peptides can be chosen: TAPAS warns if a peptide has a possible
posttranslational modiﬁcation or an incomplete peptidase diges-
tion, which could lead to an underestimate of the peptide quan-
tity. Furthermore, it prioritizes peptides based on previous
experimental evidence obtained by MS. To perform its function,
TAPAS requires inputs for the query genes, the query databases
(Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL) and/or the user-deﬁned splice variant
sequences.

Absolute quantification of splice variants: TAPAS estimates the
amounts of alternative splice variants by considering the
abundance of peptides measured from SIL-based targeted MS

experiments. It uses a numerical optimization method imple-
mented in the Stan’s C-l--l- framework to ﬁnd the desired solu-
tion, i.e. the quantities of splice variants, by minimizing the gaps
between the estimated and observed abundances of peptides
(Equation 1).

where A,- is the abundance of peptide i and 6k is the estimated

when peptide i belongs to splice variant k, otherwise it gives zero.
N ( x| u, 02) represents probability of x from normal distribution
function with mean u, and SD 0. To estimate the protein abun-
dances of selected splicing variants, TAPAS requires the
observed abundance of peptides, identification of peptidases
and splice variant sequences as inputs.

Validation of the quantification method: We tested our method
with a simulation dataset modeled by lognormal distributions.
TAPAS quickly converged to a solution and gave robust results
on different simulations conditions. Moreover, we found that
TAPAS accurately estimated amount of splice variants from
experimentally measured peptides amounts. The average percent-
age of error in the estimated amounts of splice variants was
24.0%. We validated our computational approach by purifying
and mixing two Grb2 splice variants and performing absolute
quantitation of both splice variants using selected reaction moni-
toring (SRM) based on SIL reference peptides (Supplementary
Material).

Estimation of quantifiable splice variants: Through a systematic
analysis of databases with MS-detected peptides (mostly of
trypsin origin; Mallick et al, 2007), we theoretically estimated
that ~50% of the human isoforms and splice variants could be
quantiﬁable. This number goes up to ~92% if multiple speciﬁc
proteases are independently used and the results are combined
(Supplementary Material).

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

TAPAS is a framework that brings together experimental design
and computational analysis for the absolute quantiﬁcation of

splice variants. It designs experiments by selecting the minimal
combination of shared and unique peptides needed to analyze a
speciﬁc set of splice variants. By taking advantage of quantitative
SIL-based proteomics, TAPAS can estimate the quantities of
splice variants. Our method also allows users to query protein
family members with homologous sequences. We tested TAPAS
with SRM-based MS approaches, but we anticipate that this
splice variant quantiﬁcation strategy can be applied to other tar-
geted MS approaches, such as multiplexed MS/MS (MSX) and
Sequential Window Acquisition of all THeoretical Mass Spectra
(SWATH), which would enable numerous splice variants to be
quantiﬁed in a single experiment.

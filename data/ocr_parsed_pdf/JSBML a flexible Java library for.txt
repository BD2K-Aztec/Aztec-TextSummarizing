ABSTRACT

Summary: The specifications of the Systems Biology Markup
Language (SBML) define standards for storing and exchanging
computer models of biological processes in text files. In order
to perform model simulations, graphical visualizations and other
software manipulations, an in-memory representation of SBML is
required. We developed JSBML for this purpose. In contrast to prior
implementations of SBML APls, JSBML has been designed from the
ground up for the JavaTM programming language, and can therefore
be used on all platforms supported by a Java Runtime Environment.
This offers important benefits for Java users, including the ability to
distribute software as Java Web Start applications. JSBML supports
all SBML Levels and Versions through Level 3 Version 1 , and we have
strived to maintain the highest possible degree of compatibility with
the popular library libSBML. JSBML also supports modules that can
facilitate the development of plugins for end user applications, as
well as ease migration from a libSBML-based backend.
Availability: Source code, binaries and documentation for JSBML
can be freely obtained under the terms of the LGPL 2.1 from the
website http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML.

1 INTRODUCTION

The XML-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML,
Hucka et al. 2003) is the defacto standard ﬁle format for the storage
and exchange of quantitative computational models in systems
biology, supported by more than 210 software packages to date
(March 2011). Much of this success is due to its clearly deﬁned
speciﬁcations and the availability of libSBML (Bornstein et (11.,
2008), a portable, robust, full-featured and easy-to-use library.
LibSBML provides many methods for the manipulation and
validation of SBML ﬁles through its Application Programming
Interface (API). Primarily written in C and C++, libSBML
also provides automatically generated language bindings for
JavaTM, among other programming languages. However, the ﬁill
platform independence brought by the use of Java is limited

in libSBML because the binding is only a wrapper around the
C/C++ core, implemented using the Java Native Interface (JNI).
As a consequence, some software developers experience difﬁculties
deploying portable libSBML-based Java applications. Several
groups in the SBML community thus began to develop their own
Java libraries for SBML. To avoid needless duplication, some of
these groups recently pooled their efforts and created JSBML, an
open-source project to develop a pure Java library for SBML.

The primary aim of the project is to provide an API that
maps all SBML elements to a ﬂexible and extended Java type
hierarchy. Where possible, J SBML strives for 100% compatibility
with libSBML’s Java API, to ease the transition from one library to
the other. There are currently no plans to re-implement the more
complex ﬁmctionalities of libSBML, such as model consistency
checking, SBML validation and conversion between different SBML
Levels and Versions; separate community efforts are under way to
provide such libSBML facilities via web services.

The software produced by the project is freely available from
http:// sbml.org/ Software/J SB ML.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

A key achievement of the JSBML project is the development of
an extended type hierarchy, designed from scratch based on the
SBML speciﬁcations, but still following the naming conventions
of methods and classes in libSBML. For each element deﬁned in
at least one SBML Level/Version combination, JSBML provides
a corresponding class reﬂecting all its properties. SBML elements
or attributes not part of higher SBML Levels (removed or made
obsolete) are marked as deprecated. J SBML deﬁnes superclasses or
interfaces for elements that share common properties. For instance,
the interface NamedSBase does not directly correspond to a data
type in one of the SBML speciﬁcations, but serves as the superclass
of all SBase-derived classes that can be addressed by an identiﬁer
and a name. Similarly, all classes that may contain a mathematical
expression implement the interface MathContainer. A ﬁill
overview of this type hierarchy can be found in the Supplementary
Material associated with this article. JSBML also supports SBML
notes in XHTML format, as well as SBML annotations, including
MIRIAM identiﬁers (Le Novere et al., 2005) and SEC terms
(Le Novere et (11., 2006). When building JSBML, the latest SBO
OBO export can directly be downloaded and parsed (Holland
et al., 2008). The Model class provides several methods, all
beginning with the name find*, for querying SBML elements.
Filters enable users to search lists for elements that possess

speciﬁc properties. All ListOf* elements in JSBML implement
Java’s List interface, making iteration and the use of generic
Java types possible. Figure 1 demonstrates how the hierarchically
structured content of an SBML ﬁle can be easily visualized in the
form of a tree.

J SBML includes parsers that read mathematical formulas in
both MathML format and an inﬁx formula syntax. Internally, it
converts formulas into an abstract syntax tree representation; it
can write out the trees in MathML, inﬁx and TATEX formula
notations. In addition, although JSBML does not implement full-
featured consistency checking of SBML models, it does throw Java
exceptions in some situations to prevent users from creating invalid
content. It implements a check for overdetermined models using the
algorithm of Hopcroft and Karp (1973); this is also used to identify
variables in algebraic rules. Further, J SBML can automatically
derive the units of a mathematical expression. Whenever a property
of some SBase is altered, an SBaseChangeEvent is ﬁred that
notiﬁes dedicated listeners. As one possible application, graphical
user interfaces could automatically react when the model is changed.
Using modules, JSBML capabilities can be ﬁirther extended; it
can therefore be used as a communication layer between an
application and libSBML or CellDesigner (Funahashi et al., 2003)—
this also facilitates turning an existing application into a plugin for
CellDesigner.

3 CONCLUSON

JSBML is an ongoing project that provides comprehensive and
entirely Java-based data structures to read, write and manipulate
SBML ﬁles. Its layered architecture allows for the creation of
Java Web Start applications and CellDesigner plugins based

on stand-alone programs with very little effort. New versions
of SBMquueezer (Drager et al., 2008) and Biomodels Database
(Li et al., 2010) have already been released using JSBML. Many
other projects are planned.

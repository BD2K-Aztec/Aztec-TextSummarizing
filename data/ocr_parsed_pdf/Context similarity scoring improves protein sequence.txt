Abstract

Motivation: High—quality protein sequence alignments are essential for a number of downstream
applications such as template—based protein structure prediction. In addition to the similarity score
between sequence profile columns, many current profile—profile alignment tools use extra terms
that compare 1D—structural properties such as secondary structure and solvent accessibility, which
are predicted from short profile windows around each sequence position. Such scores add non—re—
dundant information by evaluating the conservation of local patterns of hydrophobicity and other
amino acid properties and thus exploiting correlations between profile columns.

Results: Here, instead of predicting and comparing known 1D properties, we follow an agnostic ap—
proach. We learn in an unsupervised fashion a set of maximally conserved patterns represented by
13—residue sequence profiles, without the need to know the cause of the conservation ofthese pat—
terns. We use a maximum likelihood approach to train a set of 32 such profiles that can best repre—
sent patterns conserved within pairs of remotely homologs, structurally aligned training profiles.
We include the new context score into our HMM-HMM alignment tool hhsearch and improve espe—

cially the quality of difficult alignments significantly.

Conclusion: The context similarity score improves the quality of homology models and other meth—

ods that depend on accurate pairwise alignments.

1 Introduction

Most methods for fold recognition and protein structure prediction
are based on the pairwise alignment of query and template sequence
profiles (Elofsson, 2002; Yan et (11., 2013). Top-performing
structure prediction tools add to the profile column similarity score
a secondary structure score; which improves the sensitivity for
detecting remote homologs and the quality of the resulting
alignments (Karplus et (11., 2003; Xu and Xu, 2000). In order
to maximize the information gain and therefore the improvements
in alignment quality; various finer-grained alphabets of backbone
structure states have been developed—together with tools to

predict these states (Karchin et (11., 2003, 2004; Katzman et (11.,
2008).

In addition to secondary structure; other ID structural properties
are employed to improve sequence alignments in the so-called twi-
light and midnight zone; such as solvent accessibility (Liu et (11.,
2007); residue coordination numbers (Karchin et (11., 2004; Peng
and Xu, 2009; Wu and Zhang, 2008); backbone dihedral torsion
angles (Wu and Zhang, 2008); ID environmental fitness scores
(Peng and Xu, 2009; Teichert et (11., 2010); or a combination of
these (Faraggi et (11., 2011; Ma et (11., 2012; Yang et (11., 2011). In all

2.3 EM algorithm

We use the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to maximize the
likelihood in eq (1) of generating the pairs of aligned training pro—
files. Lagrange multipliers allowed us to analytically perform the op—
timization in the M—step under the constraints in Equation (5) (see
Supplementary Material).

2.4 Scoring functions

2.4.1 Context states score

We define the context score for position i in profile X and position /'
in profile Y as a log—odds score,

PXivY'
Sctx(Xi7Y,‘) :log<P ( lie) >

<x.-1®>P<Y,-1®> ‘6)

that is, the logarithm of the ratio of probability for X, and Y; to
have been generated together from the same context state (see
Equation 3), divided by the probability for X, and Y; to have been
generated independently of each other. By applying Bayes’ Theorem

twice,

this expression can be transformed into the following form,

Note the analogy to the log—sum—of—odds scoring function for pro—
file—profile alignment that was derived in (Soding, 2005),

Here, the amino acid a is analogous to our context state k.
The numerators describe the probability to co—emit the same amino
acid a or the same context state z" : k, respectively. [(11), the
background frequency of amino acid a, is analogous to ark.
Multiplying by 1/f(a) (or 1/ock) corrects for the fact that frequent
amino acids (context states) match up more frequently by chance
than rare ones.

Finally, the total score is a linear combination of profile column
score, context states score, and hhsearch’s standard three—state
secondary structure score (Soding, 2005):

Stotal(i7/) :  _ wctx)  + wctx Sctx(Xi7 
+wssSss(i7/) 

As the context states score comprises of D : 13 columns, we cor—
rect the weight wctX for the redundancy caused by the overlap of
D—1 positions between two consecutive windows (Supplemental
Material).

2.4.2 str alphabet score

Apart from secondary structure, we tested a fine—grained structural
alphabet str, which was developed to improve the alignment qual—
ity and which performed well in several CASP competitions
(Karchin et al., 2003). It is an enhanced version of the DSSP
alphabet (Kabsch and Sander, 1983), which subdivides the E state
(Ii—strand) into six states. We applied the improved four—layer neural
networks of (Katzman et al., 2008) and determined for all query and
template residues the probabilities for each of the 13 letters in the
str alphabet.

We denote 17330.5) as the probability for letter 5 E {1.. . .. 13} at
position i of profile X and similarly p§}r(/‘.s) for the Y. The str
structural score Sstr is defined as a log—sum—of—odds score in analogy
to Equations (8) and (9):

13 tr - str -
- - Pk (175M711 (I75)
Ssr . = E #7 11
t (1 7) 5:1 pbtg(s) ( I

where pig is the background probability for str state 5 in a large set
of proteins. This str score was added to the total score with its
own optimized weight (Section 2.6).

2.5 Data sets

First, we filtered the SCOP (V1.75, Lo Conte et al., 2000) to obtain
a set with a maximum pairwise sequence identity of 20% and en—
riched each SCOP20 sequence by generating a multiple sequence
alignment with our iterative HMM—HMM searching tool hhblits
(Remmert et al., 2012) (two iterations against uniprot20 with stand—
ard parameters). Then each MSA was converted into an HMM via
hhmake (Remmert et al., 2013), ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/
pub/HH—suite/hhsuite—userguide.pdf) with standard parameters.
Finally, the dataset was divided into two sets by assigning the mem—
bers of every fifth fold into a smaller set Strain (1492 domains) and
the rest into a set Stest (5426 domains). Query and templates for the
training and optimization set were then sampled from Strain, whereas
test alignments are sampled from Stest. This procedure is important
to ensure that none of the sequences in the test sets are homologous
to any of the sequences in the training and optimization sets.

2.6 Parameter optimization

Because the time to compute the context score is proportional to K,
we need to keep K low in order not to significantly slow down
hhsearch. The improvements between K: 128 and K232 were
moderate, so we chose K : 32. As D : 13 for the window width was
found to perform well in various related applications (e.g. Biegert
and Soding, 2009) we chose the same value without further
optimization.

We needed to optimize the parameters wcemer and I} describing
the weights w, in Section 2.2 and the weight wctx of the context score
in Equation (10). We could get better results by using separate par—
ameter sets for training the context states library (winter. If“) (for
which no weight wctX is needed) and for the alignment stage
(wﬁlmﬂ.ﬁal.wctx). Because systematic testing of winter and I?“ re—
quires to generate a context library for each setting and furthermore
the performance then depends on the other parameters, these were
also adapted from (Biegert and Soding, 2009) (wfenter : 1.3 and
If“ : 0.85), so that the left and rightmost columns in a context pro—
file get a weight w;:_6 : Lil/:6 : 0.49. We checked libraries with
: 0.2 and 0.5, but this led to flatter context states and
a drop in performance.

lower winter

To optimize the alignment algorithm parameters, we performed
a grid search for winter 6 {0.2. 0.25. 0.5. 1} and Wm 6
{0.8.0.9. 1. 1.1. 1.2} and measured the average of alignment sensi—
tivity and precision on 1000 pairwise alignments where query and
template were sampled from Strain. We obtained best results for

to“ : 0.2 and Wm : 1. Surprisingly, winter turned out to be

center
clearly smaller than 1 so that the context states become flatter dur—
ing scoring.
We optimized the parameters (waywﬁimﬂ. corr) specifically for
the ROC5 homology detection benchmark by maximizing the area
under the ROC5 curve, using the same context state library as in the

alignment quality benchmarks. We used all sequences in Strain. In

addition to wax and w the parameter corr from hhsearch

we arrived at wax : 0.6. winter : 0.4 and corr : 0.2. The optimiza—
tion of the secondary structure score weight and the str alphabet
weight were done on the same set and yielded wSS: 0.25,
wm : 0.12.

3 Results
3.1 Training

We sampled up to 10 pairs of proteins per superfamily in Strain and
accepted if their structural alignment score using tmalign (Zhang
and Skolnick, 2005) was between 0.5 and 0.85. If a window of
width D : 13 centered at a structurally aligned residue pair had at
least nine pairs within a distance of 5  in the structural alignment,
the window was selected as a training sample and the D columns in
the two corresponding count profiles were cut out. This procedure
returned 141 508 training profile window pairs from 2987 pairwise
alignments. Subsequently, these training pairs were filtered by calcu—
lating the mean column score SEIEI (Equation 9) over all D : 13 col—
umns and we rejected the trivial cases with SEIEI > 1.5 (46 839
samples). At the beginning of training, we initialized the context
states library randomly and ran 25 EM iterations. Different initial—
izations and more iteration led to quite similar log—likelihood values
and libraries, indicating a robust training (see Supplementary
Section 9 for a plot of the library).

3.2 Alignment quality

We first assess the effect of context similarity scoring for global
alignments (Tables 1—4) since global alignments (or quasiglobal
local alignments) are used as input to homology modeling, the most
important application of our method. We then proceed to analyze
the quality of local alignments (Fig. 2).

We created two sets of pairwise alignments, a ‘hard set’ and an
‘easier set’. For the hard set, we sampled 6000 query—template pairs
from Stest by randomly selecting pairs from the same SCOP
superfamily but from a different family, with a tmalign score be—
tween 0.5 and 0.9, up to a maximum number of 25 pairs. For the eas—
ier set, we sampled 3000 query—template pairs from Stest by randomly
selecting up to 25 pairs from the same SCOP family with a tmalign
score between 0.6 and 0.95. These resulted in a mean tmalign score
of 0.61 for the hard and 0.72 for the easier set and in a mean sequence
identity of 14.3% for the hard and 16.4% for the easier set (see
Supplementary Table 52 and Supplementary Data File).

The difficulty for an HMM—HMM alignment algorithm also de—
pends strongly on the amount of evolutionary information available
in the two profile HMMs. Even structurally very similar pairs can
be difficult to align when their profile HMMs were only trained on
thin MSAs with few homologous proteins. Vice versa, even very re—
mote homologs can often be reliably aligned when their profile
HMMs were trained on thick, diverse MSAs.

To test the influence of the context similarity score on the
amount of evolutionary information available in the profile HMMs,
we created variant test sets of HMMs trained on MSAs with low di—
versity. These reflect better the diversity of MSAs encountered in
practice than the typically rich and diverse MSAs from sequences in
the SCOP, which mostly belong to large, very well studied protein
families. To this end, we reduced the number of effective sequences
(Neff) of the MSAs to a maximum value of 3 by using hhfilter
(Remmert et 41., 2013) with the —neff 3 option. Neff quantifies the
diversity in an MSA (Supplemental Material). It lies between 1 for a

single sequence and 20. In summary, we have created four different
test sets: hardNeff_def. hardNerow. eaSIeI'Neff_def and easierNeff_1ow.

We measured the alignment accuracy in terms of residue—based
sensitivity and precision, where sensitivity :TP/(TP+FN) and
precision:TP/(TP+FP). A true positive (TP) is a pair of residues
that is aligned correctly, that is, occurs in the reference alignment by
tmalign (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005 ). A false positive (FP) occurs
in the test alignment but not in the reference alignment. A false nega—
tive (FN) occurs in the reference alignment but not in the test align—
ment. All alignments were generated in global alignment mode using
hhalign with option —mact 0.

We evaluated six different score combinations on each of the
four benchmark sets (Tables 1—3): (i) the baseline version (‘profile’)
that uses only the column score SEIEI (Equation 9) and no secondary
structure score, (ii) the secondary structure score based on PSIPRED
predictions (Jones, 1999) for the first and 3D structure—based DSSP
assignments for the second sequence of each pair (‘ss’), (iii) the sec—
ondary structure score based only on PSIPRED predictions for both
sequences (‘SSpred’), (iv) the sum of the score in (3) and the score
based on the predictions of the 13—state str alphabet (Equation 11)
(‘ss+str’) that was optimized for its positive impact on alignment
quality (Karchin et al., 2003), (v) the context similarity score
(Equation 8) (‘ctx’) and (vi) the sum of the score in (3) and the con—
text similarity score (‘ss+ctx’).

Tables 1 and 2 show the results of the alignment benchmark for
the hard test set with default diversity and with low diversity MSAs,
respectively. The score ‘SSpred’ that makes use of only predicted sec—
ondary structure performs almost as well as the score ‘ss’ that requires
the actual secondary structure of one of the aligned proteins, for high
and low diversity MSAs. When combined with the secondary struc—
ture score based on DSSP, both the ‘str’ alphabet—based score (‘ss+str’)
and the context similarity score (‘ss+ctx’) lead to additional improve—
ments, but these are clearly more pronounced for the ‘ss+ctx’ score,
which achieves the highest sensitivity and precision on high and low
diversity MSAs. All three secondary structure classes profited to a
similar degree from the additional scoring terms.

Interestingly, the improvements owing to the secondary structure
scoring and to the context score are much stronger for low—diversity
MSAs than for high—diversity ones (improvement of ‘ss+ctx’ over
‘ss’ of 3.6/2.7% (sensitivity/precision) for high—diversity MSAs and
of 11.5/9.2% for low—diversity MSAs). Although the purely se—
quence—based score SSpred performs similarly to the context similar—
ity score ‘ctx’ for high—diversity MSAs, the new context score is
clearly superior for low—diversity MSAs.

On the easier dataset (Table 3), secondary structure was still bene—
ficial but the relative improvements in sensitivity/precision declined
from +3.6/+2.7% for more distantly related pairs to +1.3/+1.1% for
the easier cases. In contrast to the hard cases, the str—based score and
the context scoring led to only minor gains. However, as for the hard
set of protein pairs, when MSA diversity was low, str and in particular
the context score again yielded significant improvements (Table 3)
over the secondary structure score alone (sens/prec gain: +1 and
+0.9% for str and +4.8 and +3.9% for ctx, respectively).

So far we have assessed global alignments. To render the com—
parison of the quality of local alignments meaningful, we have to
measure residue—wise precision and sensitivity for different settings
of sensitivity versus precision tradeoff. The alignment tools in HH—
suite allow the user to control this tradeoff with the —mact option.
Figure 2 shows the resulting receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
plot. Similarly to the global alignment case (—mact 0.0), context simi—
larity scoring improves the alignment quality and is most beneficial
when the number of effective sequences is low.

The differences between ‘ss+ctx’ and ‘ss’ are signiﬁcant according to the

In summary, our new context similarity score consistently im—
proved the alignment quality when combined with the standard sec—
ondary structure scoring in hhsearch. In the cases in which no
secondary structure is available, the context score (‘ctx’) also con—
sistently improved the alignment quality in comparison with the
other purely sequence—based score (‘SSpred’). The extent of improve—
ments is larger the more difficult the alignment is, that is, the more
diverged the two proteins are and the lower the diversity of the
MSAs that their profile HMMs were trained on (see Supplementary
Figure S2 for the dependence on alignment diversity). Because the
calculation of the context states score increases the runtime by a fac—
tor of about 100, one profit mostly when realigning only a set of
preselected templates for homology modeling (Section 3.4).

3.3 Comparison with the profile alignment tool PPAS

It is compared with hhalign with secondary structure and context score.

prediction community, most modern methods were not designed to
run independently of their protein structure prediction pipeline.
Because our goal here is to compare alignment methods and not
methods to generate sequence profiles, we could not benchmark
these tools. However, PPAS, a profile—profile alignment tool de—
veloped in the lab of Yang Zhang, could be modified to run on user
defined database profiles. It had been reported to yield equal or bet—
ter results than hhsearch on a benchmark with hard and medium
targets (Yan et al., 2013) and performed only slightly worse than
their flagship aligner MUSTER (Wu and Zhang, 2008) that includes
several 1D structure—based scores. We were unable to benchmark
MUSTER as tools for pre—computing template profiles containing
the 1D structure information are not available.

Because PPAS requires profiles in PSI—BLAST format, we con—
verted our template MSAs into PSI—BLAST format by calling
blastpgp with the —C option and a dummy database containing a
single sequence. Yet for the query we had to keep the dependency on
the PSI—BLAST output, because PPAS needs to parse it directly. For
the default Neff benchmarks (eaSIeI'Neffidef. hardNedeef), we ran
PPAS with three PSI—BLAST iterations, and used the default MSAs
from Stest for hhalign. For the low Neff benchmarks
(easierNeleow. hardNeffJow), we reduced the number of iterations to
two, the minimum valid value for PPAS to run. This resulted in an
average diversity of Neff: 5.9 for the easy set and 5.67 for the hard
set which is clearly above our filtered low Neff MSAs (Neff 22.84).

Fig. 2. Sensitivity and precision for local alignments on the hard set. The meat
parameter controls the tradeoff of alignment sensitivity and precision
(‘greediness'). Global alignment corresponds to -mact 0.0

Thus, we converted these query PSI-BLAST alignments into a format
readable by hhalign, ensuring that PPAS and hhalign received
the same input.

We compared PPAS with two versions of hhalign: version (3)
with secondary structure scoring based on PSIPRED and DSSP and
version (6) that additionally includes the context score. Both ver-
sions exceeded PPAS’s sensitivity and precision by 14 and 17% on
the hard set and by 7 and 10% on the easier set, respectively.
Surprisingly, hhsearch outperformed PPAS even without second-
ary structure information.

3.4 Application to homology modeling

A quality bottleneck in homology modeling is the generation of ac-
curate alignments between the query and template sequences. We
therefore tested the impact of our context similarity scoring on hom-
ology modeling by comparing the quality of 3D models generated
from alignments of different methods. To build the 3D models we
used MODELLER (Sali and Blundell, 1993), the most widely used
tool for homology modeling. The results are shown in Table 5.

As expected, the better alignments led to better homology mod-
els: The context score in hhalign improved models on the hard set
on high diversity MSAs by 10.2% (default Neff) and 9.9% (low
Neff) over PPAS models and on the easier set by 6.4% (default Neff)
and 5.9% (low Neff). Again, the more difficult the query-template
alignments, the larger were the improvements due to the context
similarity score.

3.5 Remote homology detection
When searching large databases like the PDB, out of the numerous
matches detected, often only a few are of interest. For homology
modeling, for instance, it suffices to identify 1—5 suitable homolo-
gous templates. Consequently, it is important to rank homologous
proteins on top. We therefore analyze the sensitivity for remote
homology detection using a ROC5 plot. For each query protein, one
computes the ROC5 value, which is the area under the ROC curve
up to the fifth FP. The ROC5 plot shows the fraction of queries for
which the ROC5 value is above the threshold on the x-axis. A meas-
ure that summarizes the performance on the ROC5 benchmark is
the area under the ROC5 curve (AUC).

We performed an all-against—all search with hhsearch in local
alignment mode (the standard setting for template searches in our

The methods are tested on the same hard and easy set of query-template
protein pairs as in the previous section. A high and a medium diversity set of
MSAs was built from the query and template sequences using three and two
iterations of PSI-BLAST, respectively. The paired t-test P-values demonstrate

a statistically signiﬁcant improvement of ‘ss+CtX’ over ‘ss’ quality scores.

We defined members belonging to the same superfamily as TPs and
those of different folds as FPs. Pairs with both proteins within the
four- to eight-bladed ﬁ-propellers (SCOP fold IDs b.66—b.70) were
treated as unknown, and the same for Rossmann-like folds
(5.2 — 5.5. 5.30. 5.66. 5.78. 5.79. 5.111). The ROC5 analysis in
Figure 3 shows that adding secondary structure (‘ss’) increases the
AUC from 0.583 to 0.609 (4.4%). str and 5tx scoring give moderate
improvements to 0.625 and 0.641 (2.6 and 5.2% compared with
‘ss’), respectively.

4 Discussion

4.1.1 Context-specific pseudocounts

Each residue in a protein is subject to very specific selection con-
straints that mostly are caused by the requirement of folding into a
stable 3D structure. The constraints depend on the local structural
context, which can be predicted to some extent directly from each
residues’ sequence context. In Angermuller et a1. (2012) and Biegert
and Soding (2009), we exploited this concept to learn a set of 4000
patterns best describing a representative set of 106 training sequence
profiles. Using these, we could enrich sequences and sequence pro-
files with context—specific pseudocounts. This approach is imple-
mented in all hh-suite programs since version 2.0.15. Hence, the
improvements observed here come on top of those already reported
for context-specific pseudocounts.

The difference between the previous approach and the one taken
here is the degree to which we demand conservation of patterns. In
Angermuller et al. (2012) and Biegert and Soding (2009), conserva-
tion needed to be just good enough to leave a clear pattern in the
training profiles built from relatively closely related sequences.
Here, in contrast, we use pairs of remotely homologous proteins and
structural alignments, which are more reliable than HMM-HMM
alignments at low sequence similarities, to find patterns that are
highly conserved across large evolutionary distances, roughly corres-
ponding to the SCOP superfamily level.

4.1.2 D structural properties

In contrast to secondary structure similarity scores and similar
scores based on the conservation of 1D structural properties, we
take an unsupervised approach of learning the conserved patterns.
Hence, we do not need to know what particular property led to the
conservation of the patterns we learn. Therefore, while we have not
succeeded in capturing all possible conserved patterns in our
32-state library (shown in Supplementary Figure S3), we have mani-
festly learned conserved patterns whose information cannot be

Mean ROC5 value

Fig. 3. ROC5 plot: fraction of query HMMs whose ROC5 value is above the
value on the x—axis. The ROC5 value for a query is the average sensitivity in a
query-specific ROC plot up to the fifth FP match

reduced to a 3-state or even 13-state alphabet of local backbone geo-
metries. Because protein structure is known to be well conserved, we
expect many recurring local structural features such as those
described by structural alphabets to be overlapping to some degree
with our context states.

4.1.3 Failed approach 1: discriminative learning

Instead of maximizing the likelihood in Equation (1) we tried hard
to maximize the sum of similarity scores of positive training samples
minus the sum of scores for negative training samples. Yet, this ob-
jective function is no longer likelihood, precluding use of the EM al-
gorithm. Moreover, it proved to be prone to degenerate solutions
and required careful enforcement of the restraint that the probability
in the denominator in Equation (8) be equal to the average probabil-
ity of that context state over all training states.

4.1.4 Failed approach 2: transitions between context states

We tried out a more general model that allows transitions be-
tween context states lz and le’. We learned the matrix of transi-
tion probabilities P(k’(k) by maximum likelihood. The

score between local profiles X and Y was
K P(z : le) K , , .
log 2,51 Wzk,:1 P(z : la (Y)P(k  The alignment

quality and sensitivity did not improve, however, probably because
K: 32 states are not yet fine-grained enough to necessitate substitu-
tions between these states.

Conclusion

The new context score helps most in the difficult cases: (i) when lit-
tle evolutionary information is contained in the HMMs to be
aligned, and (ii) when proteins are remotely related. In the first case,
integrating the sparse evolutionary information vertically within an
MSA leads to only little noise suppression (i.e. the distinction of cor-
rect from incorrect alignments). Therefore, we profit most from
pulling together information horizontally along the MSAs. In the se-
cond case, it makes sense to focus on the features that are best con-
served among remote homologs, which is what our context score
was trained to do. The new score slows down hhsearch by a factor

of 100. This precludes its use in hhblits, whereas it will be unprob-
lematic for homology modeling and other applications, where a rela-
tively small set of proteins needs to be aligned with the best possible
quality.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Association tests based on next-generation sequencing
data are often under-powered due to the presence of rare variants
and large amount of neutral or protective variants. A successful
strategy is to aggregate genetic information within meaningful single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sets, e.g. genes or pathways, and
test association on SNP sets. Many existing methods for group-wise
tests require specific assumptions about the direction of individual
SNP effects and/or perform poorly in the presence of interactions.
Results: We propose a joint association test strategy based on
two key components: a nonlinear supervised dimension reduction
approach for effective SNP information aggregation and a novel
kernel specially designed for qualitative genotype data. The new
test demonstrates superior performance in identifying causal genes
over existing methods across a large variety of disease models
simulated from sequence data of real genes. In general, the proposed
method provides an association test strategy that can (i) detect both
rare and common causal variants, (ii) deal with both additive and
interaction effect, (iii) handle both quantitative traits and disease
dichotomies and (iv) incorporate non-genetic covariates. In addition,
the new kernel can potentially boost the power of the entire family
of kernel-based methods for genetic data analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips have enjoyed varying degrees
of success in identifying genes associated with complex diseases
or traits (Easton and Eeles, 2008; Frazer et (11., 2009; Lettre and
Rioux, 2008). It has now been widely accepted that stande GWAS
explains at most a small fraction of the population variation of most
complex traits (Frazer et al., 2009). Recently, deep resequencing
is emerging as a new and potent means for mapping complex trait
genes. Resequencing delivers orders of magnitude more variants
than SNP chips and include both common variants with minor allele
frequency (MAF) >10%, as well as rare variants with MAF <l%.
Availability of rare variant information presents unique opportunities
to evaluate the ‘common disease rare variants’ hypothesis. This
hypothesis states that a complex disease can be attributed to multiple
rare variants with relatively high risks, and it has attracted much
attention in recent studies. Attesting to this hypothesis, a number of
deleterious or protective rare variants have been identiﬁed for low

plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Cohen et al.,
2004), hypertension (Ji et (11., 2008) and Type-I diabetes (Nejentsev
et al., 2009).

Identifying disease associated rare variants, however, is
challenging, because a particular rare disease predisposing allele
may be present in only a handful of patients. Henceforth, traditional
single marker tests that capture only marginal effects are doomed
to have low power. A useful strategy to address this challenge
is to effectively merge information in SNP variants by some
meaningful SNP sets, for instance, genes or pathways, and then
to identify disease-associated genes or pathways rather than disease
variants. Following this idea, several aggregation-based association
test approaches have been developed. Li and Leal (2008) proposed
a group-wise test exploiting both multivariate and collapsing
strategies that possess higher power than a simple multivariate test
or simple collapsing. Madsen and Browning (2009) extended the
method by incorporating weights that depend on MAF into the
group-wise statistics and approximating P-values by permutations
within each group. Both methods consider rare variants with MAF
falling below a pre-speciﬁed threshold and exclude common variants
from analysis. This separate treatment seems counterproductive
because in reality both common and rare variants can be informative.
The pooling strategy of Price et al. (2010) circumvents the issue of
arbitrarily chosen frequency threshold by calculating a group-wise
statistic under a variety of thresholds. However, this strategy also
has several limitations. First, environmental predictors are excluded
from analysis even though they may contribute signiﬁcantly to a
disease. Second, interactions among SNPs cannot be effectively
detected. Third, the solution is sensitive to the classiﬁcation of
variants: if all types of variants, deleterious, protective or neutral,
coexist, then various signals can cancel one another during the
pooling and thus can potentially compromise statistical power. Liu
and Leal (2010) proposed a SNP set genotype-based statistic for rare
variants and declared that the common variants and environment
factors can be modeled together with the rare variant statistic in a
logistic regression (LR) model. However, interactions between rare
and common variants still cannot be explicitly modeled in this way,
and the method handles only dichotomous traits.

The ﬁeld of statistical dimension reduction (DR) offers a useful
and appealing means for genotype aggregation. It is based on the
belief that high-dimensional data can be effectively summarized
in a low-dimensional space, and the subsequent modeling can
concentrate on the reduced space. The most commonly used
dimension reduction approach is principal components analysis
(PCA). Chen et al. (2010) applied PCA to combine SNP information
within pathways, generated the so-called eigen-SNPs, and used
eigen-SNPs in subsequent association mapping. However, PCA has
at least two limitations. First, PCA aggregates SNPs regardless of

the phenotypic trait information. Since mapping traits to associated
genes is of ultimate interest, it is intuitively desirable to aggregate
SNPs under the guidance of trait information such as disease status or
quantitative traits. In statistical terms, PCA is an ‘unsupervised’ DR
solution, whereas a ‘supervised’ DR solution is preferred. Second,
the eigen-SNPs, or principle components, are ‘linear’ combinations
of the SNPs. As a consequence, such summary measures may
fail to capture complex interacting effects among the individual
SNPs, and in turn reduce the power of subsequent association
mapping.

In this article, we develop a powerﬁil association mapping
approach based on next-generation sequencing data. Two key
ingredients of the proposed method are a statistical DR that achieves
supervised and nonlinear reduction, and a new kernel that is based
on Markov chain theory and particularly suitable for qualitative
SNP data. Our contributions are mainly 2-folds. First, the proposed
association mapping approach simultaneously takes into account (i)
both rare and common variants, (ii) both additive and interaction
effect, (iii) quantitative traits as well as disease dichotomies and (iv)
non-genetic covariates. Second, the commonly used kernels, such as
Gaussian, polynomial and spline, work successfully with continuous
attributes, but may perform poorly for discrete genetic data. The
proposed new kernel is specially designed for discrete attributes and
can effectively capture the similarity between individual genotypes.
Moreover, the new kernel is novelly derived from powerful Markov
chain theory and can beneﬁt many kernel-based learning methods
in general. We compare our proposal with some state-of—the-art
aggregation and mapping solutions and ﬁnd that our method clearly
achieves superior power in a variety of different genetic model
scenarios.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2
describes our proposed association mapping, including kemel-based
nonlinear DR and construction of new kernels. Section 3 presents
numerical studies comparing various aggregation and association
mapping solutions. Section 4 concludes the article with a discussion
and suggests potential ﬁiture extensions.

2 METHODS

Suppose 11 study individuals are genotyped at a SNP set (e. g. a gene)
that is composed ofp SNPs denoted by X1, ...,XI,, and the trait Y
can be either binary (case—control study) or quantitative. Potential
non-genetic covariates, such as sex, age smoke, and are denoted by
C1,...,C;. There can be multiple SNP sets, and we treat ‘one set at
a time’. The goal is to test the association of the trait and all markers
in the SNP-set ‘jointly’, after adjusting for non-genetic covariates.
In sequence studies, the number of markers 1) is potentially large and
can outnumber the number of subjects 11. Our proposed group-wise
association test consists of two key elements: a nonlinear supervised
DR method that aggregates markers and produces summary features
and a novel kernel that encodes genomic similarity. The nonlinear
DR method was ﬁrst proposed in Zhu and Li (201 1) for gene pathway
analysis and for completeness, we review the method here. The new
kernel is constructed under the guidance of Markov chain theory
for discrete genotype. Using Markov chains to build kernels for
non-standard data is novel and the resulting kernels can potentially
beneﬁt the entire family of kernel methods (e.g. support vector
machines) for genetic data analysis.

2.1 Nonlinear supervised DR

We begin with a brief review of PCA, which has been an extremely
popular tool in analysis of genetic and genomic data. For instance,
PCA has been used to adjust for population stratiﬁcation (Price et al.,
2006) in GWAS or to produce a set of eigen-SNPs for association
mapping (Chen et al., 2010). Given 1) SNPs, PCA seeks linear
combinations of SNPs that have maximal variances. It is solved
by an eigen decomposition of SNP covariance matrix. Then, the
eigenvectors with leading eigenvalues give the coefﬁcients of linear
combinations being sought. The linear transformed SNPs form the
eigen-SNPs used in the subsequent analysis. Despite its widespread
applications, however, PCA conducts DR without utilization of the
phenotypic trait information, and thus there is no guarantee that
the top extracted principle components are relevant to the traits.
Consider a simple illustrative example. Suppose two SNPs X1 and
X2 are in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Then, the variance of the
linear combination X1+X2 is larger than that of X1 —X2 and thus
the eigen-gene found by PCA will be closer to the direction X1 +X2
than to X1 —X2. If in truth these two SNPs have opposite effects—
one deleterious the other protective—then the trait depends on the
SNPs through X1 —X2 and the eigen-gene would contain no signal
for association.

Intuitively, it is natural to incorporate the trait information during
the phase of DR, and this leads us to the family of ‘supervised’
sufﬁcient dimensional reduction (SDR) approaches. For a regression
of a response Y given a p-dimensional predictor X, SDR seeks a
minimum number of linear combinations, nIX , . . . , 11sz , such that

erl(n{x,...,n;xy (1)

That is, Y depends on X only through those linear combinations, and
one can replace the original p-dimensional X by now d-dimensional
nTX. In practice, d is often much smaller than 1), and thus DR is
achieved. We call (nEX, ...,n:1X) the ‘linear sufﬁcient predictors’,
which will serve as the induced summary features in subsequent
analysis. There have been many methods proposed for SDR, many
of which can be formulated as a generalized eigen decomposition
problem. Speciﬁcally, a reduction estimate can be obtained by the
ﬁrst d eigenvectors njs that correspond to the nonzero eigenvalues
Ajs in a descending order from the decomposition: 9X W =
Ajzxnj, j=1,...,d, where 2X=Cov(X) and ﬁx is a method-
speciﬁc 1) ><p semi-positive deﬁnite matrix (Zhu and Li, 2011). For
instance, sliced inverse regression (SIR) (Li, 1991) is a widely
used SDR estimator, where 9X =Cov{E(X|Y)—E(X)}. This family
of DR methods differ from PCA in that the response information
is used in the DR phase. It is also interesting to note that all
those SDR methods impose no parametric assumption on Y |X .
Instead, they require the marginal distribution of X to be elliptically
symmetric. This is often viewed as a mild condition, since it holds
approximately when 1) goes to inﬁnity. We assume the condition
holds since we are dealing with a very large p.

The above SDR methods yield ‘linear’ DR, because the reduction
admits the form of linear combinations of X. This could have some
limitations. Consider an illustrative example, where X = (X 1 , . . . ,X6)
and Y =X1 +X2X3 +X§ +X5X6 + 8, with an independent error 8. In
this case, no linear reduction is possible. Another potential limitation
is that one needs to invert a p ><p covariance matrix 2X, whereas
its sample estimator is not invertible when p exceeds the sample

size 11. These observations motivate us to consider a ‘nonlinear’ DR
strategy.

The basic idea is to use a ﬁinction ¢(-), with an associated kernel
matrix K, to map X to ¢(X). One then performs a linear DR in
the space of ¢(X), which in effect results in a nonlinear DR in
the original predictor space X. The well-known kernel trick turns
the primal problem that depends on the dimension of the space of
¢(X), which is high or even inﬁnite, to a dual problem that only
depends on the sample size. Consequently, the method works for
n<p. Speciﬁcally, in analogy to linear reduction in Equation (1),
nonlinear DR seeks

YiLX|((f317¢(X))7---7(ﬂa,¢(X)))- (2)

Comparing with Equation (1), the linear combinations
(nIX,...,n:1X) are replaced by the inner products
((ﬂl,¢(X)),...,(ﬂa,¢(X))), and Y depends on X only through
those inner products. We refer them as the ‘nonlinear sufﬁcient
predictors’ and assume the number [1 of inner products 3 min(n,p).
In terms of estimation, conceptually, one can estimate ﬂjs in a way
analogous to linear reduction, i.e. through the eigen decomposition:
Q¢ﬂj=pj2¢ﬂj,j=l,...,c~l, where 2¢=Cov{¢(X)} and 9,),
is deﬁned similarly as 9x except we replace X with ¢(X).
Given {(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)}, estimation of ﬂjs is obtained
by substituting in the corresponding sample counterparts:
§2¢ﬂj=pj§l¢ﬂj, j=l,...,c~1. On the other hand, the dimension
of the induced mapping ¢(X) can be very high, sometimes
even inﬁnite. As such, a direct decomposition is not feasible
computationally.

The problem can be solved by noting that the target of nonlinear
DR estimation are the inner products (ﬂj,¢(X)), rather than ﬂj
themselves. Then, given a pre-speciﬁed kernel function k, these
inner products can be obtained by solving a dual problem:
XJKaj=ij2aj, j=1,...,c7, where XEIR"X" is the centered
kernel matrix and J is a method-speciﬁc n><n matrix. Zhu and
Li (2011) gave for the speciﬁcation of J matrix for different SDR
methods, including the one for kernel SIR that will be used in the
numerical studies of this article. Then, for a new observation x6
X, (ﬂj,¢(x))=a}[k(x1,x),...,k(xn,x)]T, where k(xi,x)=k(xi,x)—

11—1 27=1k(xl,x),i= 1, ...,n. So the inner product (ﬂj,¢(x)) can be
obtained from the kernel k and tags. It is noted that the proposed
nonlinear DR approach only involves decomposition of an n X 11
matrix, so it can handle n<p. Its ﬂexible reduction form beyond
the linear combination is also expected to facilitate DR. For the
illustrative example considered above, if one uses a quadratic kernel,
then only one linear combination in the mapped feature space is
needed to summarize all regression information, and thus substantial
reduction is achieved.

2.2 Kernel-based on Markov chain

Critical to success of any kernel-based methods for genotype data
analysis is the design of kernels that can effectively capture genomic
similarity (Schaid, 2010a,b). The most popular Gaussian kernel
works well for continuous predictors but can perform poorly on
categorical predictors such as SNPs. Some specialized kernels have
been crafted for SNP data. For instance, the identity-by-state (IBS)
kernel (Wessel and Schork, 2006) calculates the distance between
two individuals with genotype vectors x,- and xj coded by numbers

of minor alleles as

Zf=1 2105119 =xjs)+1(lxis _xjsl=1)
2p -

The more general weighted IBS kernel (Kwee et al., 2008; Wu et al.,
2010) takes the form

227:1 Ws(21(xis =xjs)+1(lxis _xjsl=1))

 Ws ‘
which offers ﬂexibility of incorporating variant speciﬁc weights into
kernel. Kwee et al. (2008) and Wu et al. (2010) use ws=1/\/ﬂ
where f5 is the MAF of the variant, up-weighting the importance of
rare variants.

IBS and weighted IBS kernels can be regarded as sums of simple
similarities evaluated at each individual SNP, which, however, may
result in loss of power when complex interactions dominate the
genetic effect of the SNP set. This motivates us to propose new
kernels for genotype data.

We ﬁrst summarize some useﬁil devices for forming Mercer
(symmetric and positive deﬁnite) kernels. Suppose k is a possibly
asymmetric kernel and K is the corresponding kernel matrix with
all eigenvalues positive, then

 

K(xi7xj)=

k(xi7xj)=

 

1. (K +K T)/ 2 is symmetric and positive deﬁnite;
2. KKT is a symmetric and positive deﬁnite;

3. K oK T is symmetric and positive deﬁnite, where 0 denotes
the element-wise Hadamad product of two matrices;

4. If another Q is a kernel matrix with positive eigenvalues, then
KQ is a kernel with positive eigenvalues.

Fact 1 follows from an inequality due to Fan (Marshall et al.,
2011, Theorem F.1, p. 324). Fact 2 is trivial. Fact 3 can be
shown based on the Shur’s inequality (Scholkopf and Smola, 2001,
Proposition 13.2). Fact 4 follows from the inequality H.1.i of
Marshall et al. (2011). These rules will be used as we construct
Markov kernels below. Reader are referred to Scholkopf and Smola
(2001) Chapter 13 for more basic tricks for constructing kernels.

Since SNP values are all dichotomous or trichotomous, we
next focus on kernels that are built upon the discrete state space
X={0,1,2}1’={x=(x1,...,xp):xje{0,1,2}}. Our new kernel for
genotype data is derived from Markov chains on X. The key idea
is that the transition kernel of many Markov chains with state space
X deﬁnes a Mercer kernel after appropriate transformations. This
opens the door to create more informative kernels for data in a
non-standard space X. Speciﬁcally, our new kernel is based on the
well-known multi-allele Wright—Fisher (WF) process (Ewens, 2004)
in population genetics. Therefore, we call this the WF kernel. Each
locus is coded by the number of ‘major’ alleles and the genotype
vector xeX for a SNP set is modeled by a Dirichlet-Multinomial
distribution with parameter at = (a1 , ... ,orp), which can be efﬁciently
estimated from genotypes of all individuals (Zhou and Lange, 2010).
The transition kernel of WF process between two genotype vectors
xi,xj E X is

where n(xit)=(xit+a;)/N+|oc| and |oc| =th7=1at. k is an
irreversible Markov transition kernel and its stationary distribution
is not known explicitly but can be well approximated by
a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution with parameter at. It is
well known that k has positive eigenvalues Ai=(2p)[i]/(2p)i=
2p(2p— 1)---(2p—i+ 1)/(2p)i for i=0, ...,2p— 1 (Cannings, 1974).
Therefore, we aim to form a Mercer kernel by scaling and
symmetrizing k. For large p, the entries of the corresponding kernel
matrix K is small. To achieve better scaling, we normalize each
column of K by dividing its [2 norm. The column-scaled matrix is
denoted by K. By Fact 4 above, we know K has positive eigenvalues.
Then, by Facts 1 and 2, either the additive or multiplicative
symmetrization gives a symmetric kernel matrix with all positive
eigenvalues: K=K+KT/2 or K=KKT. The simulation study in
Section 3.3 shows the promise of the WF kernel combined with
nonlinear DR method proposed in Section 2.

2.3 A joint association testing strategy

Based on the nonlinear DR methods and the new kernel, we propose
a joint strategy to identify SNP sets that are associated with a trait
of interest in Algorithm 1. Several remarks are in order. First, as has
been mentioned above, the nonlinear DR methods can be performed
even if the sample size, n, is smaller than the number of predictors, 1).
Therefore, the entire strategy handles the situation when n is smaller
than the number of SNPs in any candidate SNP sets. Second, the
non-genetic covariates, if any, can be naturally adjusted in the GLM
modeling step. Third, both the DR and the GLM modeling step
permit different types of trait response. For a continuous trait, GLM
reduces to a linear regression, and for a typical case—control study,
it becomes a binomial model with a logit link, which leads to a LR.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Data description

We have performed simulation studies to illustrate the promise of
the information aggregation method using the nonlinear DR and the
WF kernel discussed above. These studies use real genotype data
of 697 individuals compiled from the 1000 Genome Project (2010)
by the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 (GAW17). We investigate the
empirical power and Type-I error of our method on the basis of
the LD structure of two genes, TG and COL6A3. The two genes
are used because mutations in these genes have been found to
cause certain diseases. TG encodes a protein called thyroglobulin;
mutations in this gene have been found related to congenital
hypothyroidism and autoimmune disorders (ht tp : / / ghr.
nlm. nih . gov/gene/TG). COL6A3 encodes one component of
Type-VI collagen; mutations in this gene have been found related
to Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy
(http: / /ghr . nlm. nih . gov/gene/COL6A3). In the dataset,
TG contains 146 SNPs, among which 10 are common variants
(MAF>10%) and 113 are rare variants (MAF<1%); COL6A3
contains 187 SNPs, among which 10 are common variants and
143 are rare variants. In the two genes, only a few pairs of SNPs
have high LD (Fig. 1). Figure 2 provides a comparison of the MAF
distribution of TG and COL6A3 with that of the entire dataset. The
three distributions agree well except that TG and COL6A3 have
slightly higher percentage of common variants.

3.2 Simulation setup

In order to make a comprehensive performance comparison between
the proposed methods and existing ones, a variety of true genetic
effects are examined in different simulation studies (Table 1). For
each study, a total of 1000 replicates are simulated. In each replicate,
a quantitative trait is ﬁrst simulated under the null model Q0 =6,
where e is a standard normal noise. The top 50% of the distribution
of Q0 are then declared affected, by which we deﬁne a binary disease
status. It is easy to see that, under the null model, the quantitative
trait and disease status do not depend on genotypes.

Then, under the alternative model, a quantitative trait is generated
according to

Q1=f(X{1}7---7X{p})+Q07 (3)

where Xm’s are SNPs in descending order according to their
MAFs and f is the true genetic effect model, which differs among
simulation scenarios. A binary disease status based on Q1 is deﬁned
in a similar way as Q0. For reference purpose, if in Equation (3)
f = 257:1 ﬂjXU} is a linear additive model, then conditional on the
fact that this is an half-affected-half—control sample and assuming

that existence of causal SNPs in the gene does not heavily
inﬂuence the general cutoff to Q1 (which is the case for most
of our simulation studies shown below), there is an approximate
correspondence between coefﬁcient ﬂj and odds ratio of the SNP

represents cumulative normal distribution function with mean a
and stande deviation 0. Therefore, a coefﬁcient 13 from 0.2 to 1
corresponds to an odds ratio from 1.4 to 5.3. On the contrary, a
coefﬁcient 13 from —0.2 to —1 reduces odds ratio to 0.7—0.2.

3.3 Simulation results

We compared our method of DR followed by LR model (a special
case of GLM for binary trait) with kemel-based adaptive cluster
(KBAC) method of Liu and Leal (2010) and variable threshold
(VT) test of Price et al. (2010). For KBAC, if a SNP set contains
only rare variants, we adopted a permutation test for the KBAC
statistic; otherwise, following Liu and Leal (2010), a LR model
was used to incorporate both the common variants and a variable
for the kernel weight generated by KBAC. Stande permutation
procedure was then applied to evaluate the signiﬁcance. VT test can
be used regardless of the existence of common variants. We also
compared some variants at the step of DR, namely PCA, LR for
testing all SNPs, SIR and kernel SIR (kSIR) with various kernel
functions (Gaussian, IBS and WF). Multiplicative symmetrization
was performed for WF kernel. For each of the approaches under
comparison, 10000 permutations were used to generate a null
distribution for the test statistic. For each DR-based method, the
leading summary variable was used to represent the SNP set.
For each method under comparison, an empirical power was then
obtained by counting how many of empirical P-values over 1000
replications are less than a nominal signiﬁcance level of a=0.05
under the alternative model using the designated causal SNPs. An
empirical Type-I error was evaluated in a similar fashion except
that the trait was generated under the null model. As mentioned
above, we designed various scenarios to evaluate methods. Results
are summarized in Table 1.

3. 3.] Empirical Type-I error The last two rows of Table 1 show
that the empirical Type-I errors of all the methods are relatively close
to the nominal signiﬁcance level of 0.05.

3.3.2 Empirical power comparison Simulations 1—4 represent
main effect models. In Simulations 1 and 2, informative SNPs

are all common variants, whose MAFs all fall into the range of
0.32—0.43. When all SNPs are deleterious (Simulation 1), VT
outperforms KBAC, linear and nonlinear DR methods. However,
when two of the informative alleles are protective (Simulation 2),
the performance of VT drops dramatically, while the performance
of the other methods does not. In this case, WF works the best
and IBS is the second. In Simulation 3 and 4, informative SNPs
are all rare variants, whose MAFs are between 0.005 and 0.0086.
Note that few people have totally more than one minor alleles
over these 10 SNPs. No matter there are protective rare variants
or not, WF and IBS have the best and second best performance,
respectively. VT has a comparable performance when there are only
deleterious effect (Simulation 3), but the existence of protective
variants destroys its performance again (Simulation 4). Note that
under these linear genetic models, the WF and IBS kSIR’s still
work better than the LR and linear SIR, while the Gaussian kSIR
does not. This reﬂects the superiority of these kernels for sequence
data.

Simulation 5 represents a model with both main and epistasis
effects. For each gene, both of the two informative SNPs are
common variants with very low LD. In this case, WF works better
than IBS, which then outperforms KBAC, VT and other DR-based
methods. Simulations 6 and 7 are pure epistasis models among three
common SNPs with low LD between each other, while Simulations
8 and 9 represent epistasis between common and rare variants. It is
clear that nonlinear DR methods with WF or IBS kernel outperform
linear dimension reduction methods as well as KBAC and VT.
KBAC loses most of its power in detecting common and rare variant
interactions. VT performs poorly when there are protective effects.

Weighted IBS kernel using weights Wj = 1/ is also evaluated
as a candidate kernel for kSIR. The performance of weighted IBS,
however, is found worse than that of IBS for most of the studies in
Table 1 (results not shown).

We further evaluated the performance of kSIR with WF kernel
at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) using gene TG. For
Model (3), SNR is deﬁned as the ratio of the variance of the
signal f and the error variance. A number of SNR values were
simulated by multiplying f with different coefﬁcients. Figure 3
shows the empirical power for the nine scenarios that are given
in Table 1 with the SNRs ranging from 0.02 to 0.12. It is seen that
the empirical power exceeds 0.8 for additive effects with 0.1 SNR,
including the ones composed of protective and/or rare variants. The
complex interaction effects are less detectable than simple additive

Each study focuses on one genetic model mimicking a speciﬁc type of true genetic effect. Under ‘Genetic Effect’ are the true genetic effects that generate the quantitative trait,
where XU)’s are SNPs in descending order according to their MAFs. The common variants (j g 10) are selected to have low pairwise LD. The binary trait is determined from the
quantitative trait and serves as the response variable in the simulation studies. The numbers under the names of different methods are their empirical power in different studies or

effects. Nevertheless, when the SNR reaches 0.12, the empirical
power exceeds 0.7 and 0.6 for common—common and rare—common
interactions, respectively.

In conclusion, VT is extremely vulnerable to protective variants
and less sensitive to epistasis effects. KBAC does not capture
interactions between rare and common variants. Even if the
true genetic model is additive, linear DR-based methods do not
outperform nonlinear DR methods with kernels speciﬁcally designed
for genotype data. Among the different kernel methods, the proposed
WF kernel always outperforms IBS kernel, which then works better
than Gaussian kernel.

4 DISCUSSION

Ideally, an association test should be able to handle: (i) high
dimensionality of genomic dataset, which typically far exceeds the
sample size; (ii) both rare and common variants; (iii) additive,
recessive and dominant models of gene action; (iv) both quantitative
traits and disease dichotomies and (v) non-genetic covariates. Most
of existing solutions could not deliver across the board judged by
all those criteria. To bridge the gap, we have proposed a strategy
based on nonlinear supervised DR and a new kernel to effectively
aggregate genotype information. Such an aggregation increases the
likelihood of detecting multiple causal variants, whereas nonlinear
reduction permits complex interactive relationship among genetic
variants. Moreover, the GLM framework based on the aggregated
features can naturally handle both quantitative and categorical

traits, and incorporate non-genetic predictors and/or environmental
variables. Finally, the proposed WF kernel based on Markov chain
theory for genotype data has been proven useful compared with
some existing kernels and can potentially beneﬁt a wide range of
kernel methods, such as kernel PCA, support vector machines and
nonparametric and semiparametric regressions.

Genotype aggregation

 

There are a number of possible avenues for future extensions.
First, a number of Markov chain kernels in addition to the WF kernel
can be explored, for instance, Ehrenfest kernels, hypergeometric
kernels and Dirichlet-Multinomial kernels (Khare and Zhou, 2009;
Zhou and Lange, 2009). Second, our current aggregation strategy
has not taken advantage of any available information regarding
the relationships among SNPs within a SNP set, e.g. their genetic
distances. Incorporating those information can potentially facilitate
the design of more effective kernels.

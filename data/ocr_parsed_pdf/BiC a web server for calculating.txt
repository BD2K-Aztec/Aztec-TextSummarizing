ABSTRACT

Summary: Bimodal patterns of expression have recently been
shown to be useful not only in prioritizing genes that distinguish
phenotypes, but also in prioritizing network models that correlate with
proteomic evidence. In particular, subgroups of strongly coexpressed
gene pairs result in an increased variance of the correlation
distribution. This variance, a measure of association between sets
of genes (or proteins), can be summarized as the bimodality of
coexpression (BiC). We developed an online tool to calculate the BiC
for user-defined gene lists and associated mRNA expression data.
BiC is a comprehensive application that provides researchers with
the ability to analyze both publicly available and user-collected array
data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently, a number of techniques have emerged to identify subsets
of genes exhibiting bimodal patterns of gene expression, as these
distinguishing features are highly suggestive of molecular switches
(Hellwig et al., 2010). While many of these approaches attempt
to identify the modes of expression represented by a single gene
with respect to two phenotypes (Bessarabova et al., 2010; Wang
et (11., 2009), the modes of expression among sets of genes can
also be informative and can be evidenced by bimodal patterns
of coexpression. Bimodal coexpression patterns arise among
biologically related gene sets whose members have stronger mRNA
correlations, | pl, with each other than with unrelated genes. As these
highly related gene sets will have both large positive and large
negative values of ,0, their correlation pattern has greater variance
than the correlation distribution of unrelated gene sets (which is
centered around ,0:0), and Bebek et a1. (2010) took advantage of
this fact to calculate a property which they call the ‘Bimodality
of Coexpression’ (BiC). Using a non-parametric approach, they
have previously shown that the BiC can be useful in evaluating the
strength of association between a hypothetical signaling network
and an experimentally observed set of proteomic targets. In this
context, a high degree of coexpression also suggests which genes

in the candidate signaling network may act as controllers, or master
modulators (Babur et (11., 2010), of the expression patterns seen in
the proteomic experiment. We have developed an online interface to
calculate the BiC for a user-deﬁned set of genes using corresponding
mRNA expression data to test models of interaction between these
lists. The web interface developed accepts individual experiments
in simple omnibus format (SOFT), the standard format for Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Barrett et al., 2009). As the BiC
metric can use experimental omics data to evaluate candidate in
silico network models, the newly developed web interface will be
of great value in prioritizing network models for further biological
evaluation.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The starting point to calculate the bimodality of coexpression is two
or more gene (or protein) lists provided by the user; as suggested by
Bebek et al. (2010), one of these lists can be the set of genes posited
by a model of a signaling network of interest, and the other list a
set of proteomic targets. Through a simple and intuitive interface,
BiC calculates the bimodality of coexpression (f3) between these two
lists by generating coexpression distributions from a given mRNA
gene expression experiment, and a P-value based on two-group
comparisons.

2.1 Algorithm

First, mRNA coexpression (Pearsons correlation coefﬁcient) and
standard t-statistics are calculated for all genes in the array. These
two parameters are then used to compute the ‘active’ coexpression
(Bebek et al., 2010), based on user-speciﬁed case and control
labels. Active coexpression is calculated as the product of a
gene coexpression (measured by ,0) and its differential expression
(measured by a t-statistic), thus making the analysis dependent on
a two-group comparison. The active coexpression matrix relating a
given gene list gl- to a target list g; (gi, g; CS and gl- 75g), where
S is the set of all genes on the microarray) is then transformed into
vectors and its empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) that
we call F ii); the CDF for the active coexpression matrix relating g,-
to the remainder of the genes on the array, S, is also calculated (F i, S).
It should be noted that, in Bebek et a1. (2010), gi represented the
set of genes in a candidate signaling network and g; represented
an associated set of proteomic targets. The sample deviation is
calculated as the difference of the two CDFs. In short, the bimodality
of coexpression, f3,- between gl- and g; is the difference of the second

Fig. 1. Workﬂow of BiC is depicted. (A) mRNA gene expression data and
gene lists are uploaded. (B) The user may ﬁlter the uploaded samples by
utilizing sample annotations. (C) Next, case and control samples are selected.
(D) BiC processes the job while providing console output. At this stage, the
user can leave the website or monitor the progress. (E) The BiC web interface

moments of the two empirical distributions, where negative values of
f3,- represent more correlation than expected (with signiﬁcant values
of f3,- on the order of —1 X 10—4 ). We calculated the signiﬁcance
of f3,- by generating ﬂrand from randomly selected set of candidate
targets (1000 such sets of cardinality equal to that of g;). Then, for
the null hypothesis that the coexpression pattern between gl- and
g; is random, the P-value represents the probability of attaining at
least a value of | ﬁll-l via stochastic, i.e. non-biological, generation of
random targets. gl- and g; cannot be equal, and increasing overlap
between gl- and g; will increase 51-. When multiple candidate lists,
gi, are being tested, f3,- allows one to prioritize the hypothesized lists
(or networks) by the strength of their mRNA coexpression with an
experimentally deﬁned target set, gt.

2.2 Web server

The ﬁrst step of the BiC web interface requires the user to upload
gene expression data in the SOFT format as deﬁned by GEO (Barrett
et al., 2007) (Fig. 1A).This allows the user to submit both user
prepared ﬁles, as well as ﬁles downloaded directly from the GEO
repository. The uploaded arrays are required to be prenormalized
(e.g. via Robust Multiarray Averaging). The user must then upload
one or more gene lists (i.e. networks), gi and a single target list, g;
against which the bimodality of each gene list will be calculated.
In the second step, the user can ﬁlter the samples. This allows the
user to remove samples that are not relevant to the analysis without
editing the data ﬁles (Fig. 1B). The ﬁltering is done using basic
Boolean expressions with respect to sample characteristics in the
data ﬁles, e.g. sample_characteristics_ch ﬁelds in SOFT-formatted
sample ﬁle. During the third step, the user is asked to label samples
as either case or control (Fig. 1C). Finally, the job is queued and
the user is presented with the console output of the job progress
(Fig. 1D). The results are then displayed in the console output
and emailed to the user (Fig. 1E). BiC was primarily developed in
Python and the Django framework. To increase speed and handle
memory more effectively, the more resource-intensive processes
were implemented in C. BiC also implements a queuing system,
to handle both large jobs and high trafﬁc.

3 CONCLUSION

We have developed a tool for the analysis of mRNA gene expression
data in the context of two user-deﬁned gene lists. The web
application uses the mRNA correlation between the gene lists to
calculate a parameter called the bimodality of coexpression, or BiC.
This new tool linking user-deﬁned gene lists or networks with global
experimental measurements provides a way forward in evaluating
the ﬁinctional value of candidate networks, pathways or gene lists.
BiC accepts experimental measurements in the widely used GEO
SOFT format utilized by publicly available datasets, and it is freely
available to the academic community and simple to use.

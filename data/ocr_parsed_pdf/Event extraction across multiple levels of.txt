ABSTRACT

Motivation: Event extraction using expressive structured
representations has been a significant focus of recent efforts
in biomedical information extraction. However, event extraction
resources and methods have so far focused almost exclusively on
molecular-level entities and processes, limiting their applicability.
Results: We extend the event extraction approach to biomedical
information extraction to encompass all levels of biological
organization from the molecular to the whole organism. We present
the ontological foundations, target types and guidelines for entity and
event annotation and introduce the new multi-level event extraction
(MLEE) corpus, manually annotated using a structured representation
for event extraction. We further adapt and evaluate named entity and
event extraction methods for the new task, demonstrating that both
can be achieved with performance broadly comparable with that for
established molecular entity and event extraction tasks.
Availability: The resources and methods introduced in this study are
available from http : //nactem. ac .uk/MLEE/.

1 INTRODUCTION

A detailed understanding of biological systems requires the ability
to trace cause and effect across multiple levels of biological
organization, from molecular-level reactions to cellular, tissue- and
organ-level effects to organism-level outcomes (Kitano, 2002).
Consequently, any effort aiming to comprehensively represent
biological systems must address entities and processes at all of these
levels.

This challenge has so far been only partially met in biomedical
information extraction (IE) and text mining, which aim to improve
access to domain knowledge by automating aspects of processing the
literature. Until recently, efforts in domain IE were primarily focused
on the basic task of recognizing mentions of relevant entities such as
genes and proteins in text (Yeh et (11., 2005) and on the extraction of
pairwise relations between these representing, for example, protein—
protein interactions (Krallinger et (11., 2007; Nedellec, 2005). Such
representations lack the capacity to capture any but the simplest of
associations.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the extraction
of structured representations capable of capturing associations of
arbitrary numbers of participants in speciﬁc roles. Such approaches

to IE, frequently termed event extraction, are capable of representing
complex associations—such as the binding of a protein to another
inhibiting its localization to a speciﬁc cellular compartment
(Fig. 1)—and open many new opportunities for domain text mining
applications ranging from semantic search to database and pathway
curation support (Ananiadou et (11., 2010). There is signiﬁcant
momentum behind the move to richer representations for IE: more
than 30 groups have introduced methods for biomedical event
extraction in shared tasks (Kim et (11., 2011a, b); event-annotated
corpora have been introduced for many extraction targets, including
DNA methylation (Ohta et (11., 2011a), protein modiﬁcations
(Pyysalo et (11., 2011) and the molecular mechanisms of infectious
diseases (Pyysalo et (11., 2012c); event extraction methods have been
applied to automatically analyze all 20 million PubMed abstracts
(Bjorne et (11., 2010); and event extraction analyses are being
integrated into literature search systems such as MEDIEl and applied
in support of advanced tasks such as pathway curation (Ohta et (11.,
2011b).

While the event extraction approach has been demonstrated to
be applicable to a variety of extraction targets across different
subdomains of biomedical science, related efforts all share a key
restriction: nearly exclusive focus on molecular-level entities and
events.2 Entities such as proteins and genes and events such as
binding and phosphorylation are an important part of the picture
of biological systems, but still only a part, and any IE approach
aiming to capture the whole picture must also consider other levels
of biological organization.

In this study, our aim is to extend the scope of existing event
extraction resources and methods to levels of biological organization
ranging from the subcellular to the organism level as a step toward
developing the capacity for the automatic extraction of these targets
from the entire available literature. Toward this end, we propose
relevant entity and event types for annotation across these levels
with reference to community-standard ontologies, develop a set of
detailed guidelines for their annotation in text and create structured
event annotation marking over 8000 entities and 6000 events in
abstracts relevant to cancer biology, previously annotated by domain
experts to identify spans of text relevant to their interests. Using
this data, we perform experiments using state-of-the-art methods
for both entity mention detection and event extraction to analyze

see e.g. Bossy et (11., 2012; Pyysalo et (11., 2012c), but prior event extraction
efforts have not speciﬁcally targeted entities and processes between the
molecular and organism levels.

the beneﬁts of speciﬁc adaptations of such tools to the novel task.

2 APPROACH

2.1 Corpus texts and reference annotation

We selected as the starting point for our study a recently introduced
corpus of 262 PubMed abstracts on angiogenesis, the development
of new blood vessels from existing ones. The domain involves
a tissue/organ-level process that is closely associated with cancer
and other organism-level pathologies and whose molecular basis
is increasingly understood (Carmeliet and Jain, 2000), and domain
texts thus represent a good test case for structured IE across multiple
levels of biological organization.

The corpus texts were previously annotated by Wang et a1. (2011)
using a typed-span representation, marking references to molecular
level entities, cells, tissues and domain-relevant processes. We
use these annotations created by domain experts as a reference
for identifying statements of interest for our annotation, which
focuses on introducing structured event annotation and solidifying
the ontological basis of the existing entity annotation.

2.2 Representation

We apply the speciﬁc event representation ﬁrst formalized in
the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task on event extraction and applied
in numerous resources and methods introduced since. In this
representation, Entity mentions (or entities, for short) are marked as
continuous spans of text identiﬁed with a type (e.g. PROTEIN), and
event structures (or events) are n-ary associations of participants—
entities or other events—each of which is identiﬁed as participating
in the event in a speciﬁc role (e.g. Theme and Cause). Each event is
assigned a type from a ﬁxed set deﬁned for the task (e.g. BINDING
and PHOSPHORYLATION) and is associated with a speciﬁc span of text
stating the event, termed the event trigger. Events can additionally be
marked with modiﬁers identifying the event as being, e.g. explicitly
negated, or stated in a speculative context. We refer to (Kim et a1.,
2011a) for a detailed presentation of the representation.

Given the starting point of the existing corpus annotations,
our event annotation effort proceeds from spans to a structured
representation that can represent complex associations between
arbitrary numbers of entities (Fig. 1) and many other aspects that the
typed-span representation cannot, such as the direction of causality
(Fig. 2).

In addition to selecting the general form of representation, to
deﬁne a speciﬁc event annotation scheme, we must also ﬁx the
annotated entity and event types as well as the roles, participant
scopes and modiﬁers applied. For these, we build on previously
introduced resources targeting the molecular level, basing our
extensions on domain ontologies.

Fig. 2. Span versus structure. Although a representation using nested, typed
spans (left) can capture the fact that speciﬁc entities participate in a process,
it lacks the mechanisms to express, e.g. the direction of causality. The
structured event representation (right) differentiates Themes from Causes

2.3 Ontological basis

We take as basic the division between continuants (or endurants)
and occurrents (perdurants, processes or events) (see e.g.
Smith, 2003) and adopt the general principle followed also in major
previously introduced event-annotated resources that references
to continuants such as material entities are annotated using the
entity representation and references to occurrents such as biological
processes are annotated as events.3

In the deﬁnition of our annotation scheme, we aim for
compatibility with existing event-annotated corpora—primarily the
ﬁve ‘main task’ corpora introduced in the BioNLP Shared Tasks—
to allow these to be used together with the annotations that we
create and to assure that our extensions are coherent with existing
resources derived from these corpora. Thus, for molecular-level
entity and process types, we adopt the scope, semantics and
annotation guidelines of these resources as closely as possible
without compromising coverage of mentions marked as relevant
by domain experts. For entities and processes not in scope of
previous event resources, we propose new types for annotation,
basing type and scope deﬁnitions and annotation guidelines on major
community-curated ontological resources from the open biomedical
ontologies (OBO) foundry4 (Smith et a1., 2007). In brief, before
primary annotation, we analyzed mentions marked in the reference
annotation to identify entity and process types not in scope of
previously deﬁned event annotation guidelines and then deﬁned
new types and guidelines for annotation with reference to selected
ontologies. These are summarized in the following.

2.4 Annotation scheme

The focus our extensions of previously proposed event annotation
schemes is on anatomical entities such as cells, tissues and organs
and processes involving them such as growth, remodeling and
death.5

For anatomical entity types, we adopt a top-level division by
granularity (Kumar et a1., 2004) based primarily on the upper-
level structure of the Common Anatomy Reference Ontology
(CARO) (Haendel et a1., 2008), an organism-independent ontology
of anatomy based on the human-speciﬁc Foundational Model of
Anatomy (Rosse and Mejino, 2003, 2008), as outlined in our
previous work on anatomical entities (Pyysalo et a1., 2012b). To
account for pathological anatomy-level entities (e.g. glioma)—out of

 

3We use the terms ‘entity’ and ‘event’ primarily following usage in IE, to
identify forms of representation, not ontological categories. In particular, the
latter term does not denote a category distinct from processes.
4http://Obofoundry.org.

5Although the existing corpus annotation of (Wang et a1., 2011) identiﬁes
such mentions, they are typed nonspeciﬁcally, using e.g. POSITIVE
REGULATION to mark ‘development’ and NEGATIVE REGULATION for ‘[cell]
death”.

scope of ontologies of canonical anatomy—we draw on the approach
proposed by (Smith et a1., 2005). Table 1 summarizes the primary
entity types applied in the annotation.6

For event types, we draw primarily on the biological
process subontology of the gene ontology (GO) (Ashburner
et a1., 2000). As in previous event-annotated resources, we consider
only general upper-level GO terms such as growthGO: references
to speciﬁc processes included in GO through composite terms
such as regulation of heart growthGO are captured using
the explicitly structured representation7 (Fig. 3). We also capture
general statements of causal association using Regulation types, as
in previous event annotation efforts (see e.g. Kim et al., 2008).
Following the scope of the reference annotation, we introduce
event annotation also for intentionally planned processes (e.g.
injection) as outlined in the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations
(OBI) (Brinkman et a1., 2010), using a single, non-speciﬁc type
Planned process for their annotation. We additionally introduce
a Breakdown event for annotating pathological processes that
result in the breakdown of anatomical structures. Finally, we apply
the domain-speciﬁc Blood vessel development type to annotate
references to blood vessel development through expressions such
as ‘angiogenesis’ that incorporate both the process and the affected

(broadly) corresponding ontology types.

7This annotation strategy can be viewed as partly analogous to efforts to
make GO term structure explicit (Mungall et a1., 2011).

entity. Expressions such as ‘blood vessel development’ that allow
explicitly structured annotation are marked with a separate entity
annotation (e.g. ‘blood vessel’) and an event (e.g. ‘development’)
taking the entity as its Theme. The primary event types are
summarized in Table 2.

For event participants, we apply otherwise standard roles included
also in previous efforts (e.g. Theme and Cause) but introduce the
role Instrument for distinguishing entities used to carry out planned
processes from those that undergo the effects of the process.8 Also
as in previously introduced event corpora, we apply two binary
modiﬁers, Negation and Speculation, marking events as explicitly
negated (e.g. ‘cells did not proliferate’) or stated in a speculative
context (e.g. ‘growth might be inhibited’), respectively.

We refer to the detailed annotation guidelines (Pyysalo et al.,
2012a) for speciﬁcs of the annotation, but note here one
systematic difference between our annotation and the scope of
the reference ontologies: the ontologies deﬁne idealized types—
canonical anatomy and physiological processes—but texts primarily
refer to real-world instances that do not ﬁll these exacting criteria
(Bada and Hunter, 2011). We thus interpreted the scope of mentions
marked with a speciﬁc type to include not only the corresponding
(canonical) types deﬁned in ontologies but also variants such
as entities or processes inﬂuenced by mutation, including also
pathological variants. As speciﬁc examples, we mark ‘cancer cell
as CELL’, and ‘[ cancer] growth’ as Growth.

2.5 Annotation process

Primary annotation was performed by a PhD biologist with more
than a decade of experience in text annotation who had previously
coordinated several event annotation efforts (TO). Annotations were
made using the BRAT rapid annotation tool (Stenetorp et a1., 2012).

 

8For example in ‘rats were injected with hyperforin’, the ORGANISM mention
(‘rats’) is the Theme of the PLANNED PROCESS (‘injected’) and the DRUG OR
COMPOUND mention (‘hyperforin’) is the Instrument.

Detailed annotation guidelines were prepared based on those

3 METHODS

This section presents the automatic entity mention detection and event
extraction methods applied in this study, their adaptation to the novel
extraction targets and the experimental setup.

Following standard practice in domain event extraction studies, we divide
the automatic extraction task into two separate stages, the detection of entity
mentions and the extraction of events involving these and evaluate system
performance on these two separately.

3.1 Entity mention detection

For entity mention detection experiments, we applied NERsuite, a named
entity recognition toolkit based on the CRFsuite implementation (Okazaki,
2007) of conditional random ﬁelds (Lafferty et a1., 2001). NERsuite is
capable of efﬁciently incorporating features based on token matching against
large-scale lexical resources, and the applied version achieves an F score of
86.4% on the BiOCreative II evaluation standard (GENETAG) (Tanabe et a1.,
2005), effectively matching the performance of the best available systems
for the task.9

Following initial sentence splitting and tokenization, we perform
lemmatization, POS-tagging and shallow parsing using the GENIA tagger
(Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005). Next, we Optionally perform a matching step
using dictionaries compiled from the UMLS Metathesaurus (Bodenreider,
2004), Entrez Gene (Maglott et a1., 2005) and OBO Foundry (Smith et a1.,
2007) resources. We then extract a comprehensive set of features for machine
learning, building on orthographic, lexical, syntactic and dictionary match
information (see Supplementary information).

Following preliminary development test experiments, we chose to apply
a single model that jointly predicts all entity types. In the ﬁnal experiments,
we compare a base model using only from the newly annotated data without
external resources with a dictionary-supported model that incorporates
features from matching against the lexical resources derived from UMLS,
Entrez Gene and OBO foundry ontologies.

3.2 Event extraction

For event extraction, we applied EventMine,10 a pipeline-based event
extraction system using support vector machines (SVM). EventMine takes
as input document text and entity annotations, and extracts event structures
and modiﬁcations. EventMine outperforms the best systems participating in
the original BiONLP Shared Task 2011 on the GE and ID data sets (with
F scores 58.0% and 57.6%, respectively) and is competitive with the best
systems on the EPI data set (Kim et al., 2011b; Miwa et a1., 2012).
EventMine consists of four modules: (i) event trigger detection marks
likely triggers and assigns them types, (ii) argument detection identiﬁes
likely trigger-argument pairs and assigns them roles, (iii) multi-argument
event detection combines trigger-argument pairs into likely event structures
and (iv) modiﬁcation detection assigns modiﬁcation ﬂags (Negation and

Speculation). Each module addresses its task as a multi-label classiﬁcation
problem, using the one-versus-rest SVM implementation of (Fan et a1.,
2008), with a rich feature set generated from tokens and paths in the
predicate-argument structure analyses of the Enju parser (Miyao et a1.,
2009) and the dependency analyses of the GDep parser (Sagae and
Tsujii, 2007). In feature generation, EventMine applies semantic class
generalizationgeg. merging POSITIVE REGULATION and REGULATION types
for some featuresito reduce the data sparsity and the number of different
classes in the classiﬁcation problems. In addition to training EventMine on
the newly introduced corpus, we also introduced a set of generalization
rules appropriate to the introduced types. We refer to supplementary
documentation and (Miwa et a1., 2012) for further details on EventMine.

We performed event extraction experiments in two settings: training only
on the newly introduced data (base model) and training using stacking,
incorporating predictions from a model trained on the BiONLP Shared Task
2011 GE data set (Kim et al., 2011b) as the source corpus. NO other external
resources were used in the evaluation.

3.3 Experimental setup

The annotated data were initially divided into training, development and test
sets. The test set was held out during method development and parameter
selection. For the ﬁnal experiment, methods were trained on the combination
of training and development data and evaluated on the test set.

We evaluate both entity mention detection and event extraction
performance using the standard precision, recall and F scorell metrics,
microaveraged over instance-level true-positive, false-positive and false-
negative counts.

For entity mention detection, we apply the evaluation protocol and tools of
the BiONLP/JNLPBA shared task 2004 (Kim et a1., 2004), evaluating results
using three matching criteria: exact span match, left boundary match and right
boundary match. The ﬁrst requires the extent of a predicted entity mention
to be identical to that of a gold mention for the prediction to be considered
correct, whereas the latter two only require one of the boundaries deﬁning the
extent to match. We require the type of the predicted and annotated entities
to be identical in all cases.

For event extraction, we adapt the evaluation protocol and tools introduced
in the BiONLP Shared Task 2011 (Kim et al., 2011a), including providing
gold entity annotations as given for event extraction. We apply the primary
matching criteria deﬁned in the task, which Otherwise require event structures
to be identical but include the approximate span and approximate recursive
relaxations to exact match: the former allows small variation in predicted
event trigger spans and the latter permits differences in the secondary
arguments of recursive event structures for matches. For detailed deﬁnitions,
we refer to (Kim et al., 2011a).

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We next present the primary results of the annotation effort and the
entity mention detection and event extraction experiments.

4.1 Annotation effort and results

We estimate the concentrated effort to produce the corpus annotation
to have totalled approximately 250 hours, of which approximately
100 hours used on guideline development, management and
annotation consistency checking. The effort required to produce
structured event annotation is thus broadly comparable to the initial
effort by domain experts to mark text spans of interest (Wang et a1.,
2011).

level event extraction (MLEE) corpus. We note that the texts

include comparable numbers of molecular and anatomy-level entity
mentions, with a lower but still notable number of organism
mentions. The event counts show a higher density of anatomical than
molecular-level events, although general biological events dominate
overall. Overall, 1222 events, or 18% of the total, involve either
directly or indirectly (through participating events) arguments at
both the molecular and anatomy levels (Fig. 4). Table 4 presents
corpus statistics with reference to those for the three largest event-
annotated corpora in the recent BioNLP shared task 2011. We
note that although the MLEE corpus is smaller than these corpora
focusing on the molecular level in terms of e.g. word count, there is
less difference in the number of entity annotations, and the MLEE
corpus has more event annotations than two of the shared task
corpora. The introduced corpus thus has a very high density of event
annotations, which we attribute in part to the novel entity and event
types allowing a more comprehensive representation of statements
in text.

We refer to Supplementary Material Section 1.3 for an evaluation
of the corpus annotation consistency.

4.2 Entity mention detection

The overall evaluation results for entity mention detection are
listed in Table 5. We ﬁnd a consistent beneﬁt from the use of the
lexical resources, with e.g. a 3.6% point improvement in F score
(15% reduction in error) for strict matching. As expected, evaluated
performance is notably higher under the relaxed criteria, in particular
for right boundary matching. This suggests comparatively many
errors in the choice of noun premodiﬁers included in annotation
span, a distinction that may not be of critical importance for many
applications.

Table 6 lists a breakdown of performance by entity category for
the dictionary model. The detection of Organism mentions is most
reliable despite their sparseness in the data, conforming to previous
results indicating this entity class to represent a comparatively easy
problem (Gemer et al., 2010). The detection of mentions of entities
of the ANATOMY and MOLECULE categories can be performed at
broadly comparable accuracy on this corpus containing balanced
numbers of annotations of the two, suggesting that ﬁne-grained
anatomical entity detection is no more difﬁcult than established
molecular level entity detection tasks.

The overall entity mention detection performance, approaching
or exceeding 80% in F score depending on evaluation criteria, is
a very promising result given the novelty of the task and its many
challenging aspects, most obviously that it involves more than 10
distinct entity types. As points of comparison, the best single system
at the well-established single-class BioCreative 2 Gene Mention task
achieved an F score of 87.2% under matching criteria that in cases
accept more than one speciﬁc span as correct (Wilbur et al., 2007)
and the highest-performing system at the original BioNLP/JNLPBA
shared task, involving the detection of entities of ﬁve different types,
achieved an F score of 72.6% under the exact matching criterion
(Kim et al., 2004).

4.3 Event extraction

The overall results for event extraction using EventMine are
presented in Table 7. The results demonstrate that the stacked
model incorporating information from the previously introduced GE

corpus outperforms a purely corpus-internal model. Although the
improvement from incorporating the independently annotated out-
of-domain data is somewhat modest, the result does indicate that the
annotation has met its aim to maintain compatibility with this key
resource for molecular-level event annotation.

As for entity mention detection, performance for the best model,
at over 50% F score for event extraction, is very promising for
a ﬁrst experiment on the new task. For reference, the best results
in the recent, widely attended BioNLP Shared Task 2011 for the
same evaluation criteria were 56.0% F score for the GE task,
53.3% F score for the EPI task and 55.6% F score for the ID
task (Table 4) (Kim et al., 2011b). Reaching this general level
of performance suggests that the task is feasible for current event
extraction technology and that the annotation consistency and the
size of the introduced corpus are sufﬁcient for reliable extraction.

Table 8 gives a breakdown of the event extraction performance
by category. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that events involving anatomical
entities are more reliably extracted than those involving
molecular-level ones, despite the model incorporating information
from a corpus with a larger number of molecular level event
annotations than the total number of annotations in the MLEE
corpus. This is a very encouraging ﬁnding for event extraction
for anatomical processes, indicating that the representation and
extraction methods are well suited for the task.

5 CONCLUSION

We have presented the MLEE corpus, a resource aiming to extend the
coverage of resources and methods for structured event extraction
from the molecular level to encompass all levels from the subcellular
to the organism. Experiments using state-of—the-art entity mention
detection and event extraction methods demonstrated that the newly
proposed extraction targets can be met with reasonable performance
using the MLEE corpus, with approximately 80% overall F score for
entity mention detection and over 50% F score for event extraction
using standard evaluation criteria.

In ﬁIture work, we will focus on the extension of the annotations
and extraction methods to improve the domain independence of

our annotation to allow the application of the introduced extraction
methods at large scale to automatically annotate the entire available
literature. The results of these extraction efforts will be made
available through search systems such as MEDIE to further improve
access to the biomedical literature by facilitating structured semantic
queries across multiple levels of biological organization, for example
to ﬁnd statements regarding the inhibition of organ growth by
speciﬁc molecular-level entities or events.

All resources introduced in this study, including the annotated
corpus, guidelines, the evaluation tools and the methods are available

together with freely accessible online databases (Obayashi et al.,
2013; Usadel et al., 2009).

Coexpression networks have also been studied topologically,
generally showing a modular structure (Bassel et al., 2011) and a
scale—free distribution of their connectivity (Barabasi and Oltvai,
2004; Iancu et al., 2012), meaning that most genes have a small
number of coexpressors, while a few genes behave as coexpres—
sion ‘hubs’. However, the vast majority of these studies have
neglected the growing availability of RNA—seq datasets, which
provide several potential advantages over microarrays (Wang
et al., 2009). First of all, RNA—seq does not require prior know—
ledge of the studied organism, extending its usage even to poorly
characterized organisms (Balakrishnan et al., 2012), both for
‘standard’ purposes (transcriptome definition and differential
gene expression) and for any derived application (such as
sample clustering or coexpression analysis). Furthermore,
RNA—seq allows for the identiﬁcation of all transcripts, whereas
microarrays usually cover only a subset of the transcriptome.
For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the most used microarray
for quantitative transcriptomics (Edgar et al., 2002; Giorgi et al.,
2010), the Affymetrix ATHl, covers reliably and unambiguously
only 21 377 genes [based on the most recent CustomCDF anno—
tation (Dai et al., 2005)], which is only a subset of the entire
genome [27 416 genes in the TAIR10 annotation release
(Swarbreck et al., 2008)]. Finally, RNA—seq has the potential
to detect novel transcribed loci on annotated genomes (Roberts
et al., 2011), splicing variants (Richard et al., 2010) and
allele—speciﬁc events (Zhang et al., 2009), massively increasing
the investigative capability over these molecular phenomena.

In the present study, we try to determine whether RNA—seq
data can be efﬁciently used for coexpression analysis. To do so,
we derive coexpression networks from a set of 65 high quality
Illumina—based RNA—seq A.thaliana experiments, and compare
them with those extracted from biologically analogous and
equally sized microarray data. We determine the nature of
these networks, both biologically and topologically, with an
overview on different network centralities and their association
with gene essentiality (Jeong et al., 2001) in Arabidopsis. Finally,
we focus on two speciﬁc gene cases, showing how the increased
detection range of RNA—seq can indeed cover missing areas of
the coexpression networks.

2 METHODS

2.1 Dataset selection and preprocessing

We downloaded 95 samples from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive
(Leinonen et al., 2011). After the SRA ﬁles were collected, the archives
were extracted and saved in FASTQ format. The FASTQ ﬁles were
trimmed using ERNE-FILTER software (Available: http://erne.source-
forge.net), with default parameters and minimum read length at least
70% of the original size. All samples with <30% of the reads surviving
the trimming process were discarded. Surviving reads (986482 909) were
aligned on the TAIR10 A.thaliana reference genome (Swarbreck et al.,
2008) using TopHat v2.0.4 (Trapnell et al., 2009). Samples where <30%
of the trimmed reads aligned on the Arabidopsis transcriptome were not
considered for coexpression analysis. The 831 286 856 aligned reads (cor-
responding to 65 ﬁnal samples, see Supplementary File S1 for details)
were then summarized at the gene level based on the TAIR10 annotation
by Cuffdiff v2.0.2 (Trapnell et al., 2010), which provided also the raw

count and the RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of gene model per Million
mapped reads) values (Mortazavi et al., 2008). Raw counts were modiﬁed
into normalized values via the Variance-Stabilizing Transformation
(VST) method implemented in the R package DESeq (Anders and
Huber, 2010). Analogous tissue and condition microarray datasets (see
Supplementary File S1) were downloaded from Gene Expression
Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and normalized using MAS5 (Hubbell
et al., 2002). All microarray samples were quality tested using the
Robin software (Lohse et al., 2010).

2.2 Construction and evaluation of coexpression networks

PCCs between all gene pairs were calculated for each dataset, and net-
works with varying correlation coefﬁcient thresholds were extracted.
Only positive PCCs above the speciﬁed thresholds were converted into
a network edge, to allow for the application of network quality assess-
ments based on the assumption of co-presence (or co-absence) of gene
expression, speciﬁcally the existence of proteiniprotein interaction and/ or
activating gene regulation, and the belonging to the same functional
group (Jordan et al., 2004; Vandepoele et al., 2009).

The Mapman-based iso-ontological percentage in the networks was
obtained by counting the number of edges containing two genes with
at least one shared Mapman ontology term (Klie and Nikoloski, 2012).
Owing to the highly grained nature of the Mapman bins, the ontology
was trimmed to the third branch (e.g. bin 1.3.1.10 would become 1.3.1).
The total percentage agreement is then calculated by dividing the number
of agreeing edges by the total number of edges in the network. Edges
containing genes of unknown function (Mapman bin 35) were ignored for
this calculation.

The A.thaliana reference proteiniprotein interaction network, collect-
ing 96 827 protein interactions, was obtained from AtPin version
Jun-2010 (Branduao et al., 2009). The reference genetic interaction net-
work, composed by 11355 positive genetic interactions, was obtained
from AtRegNet version 15-Sep-2010 (Yilmaz et al., 2011).

The ﬁt of degree distribution of the coexpression networks to a power
law was calculated as in (Brohée et al., 2008).

Networks were graphically represented using Cytoscape (Smoot et al.,
2011); node colouring was applied to the networks following the
Mapman ontology described within the CorTo tool (Available at:
http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=corto) and in
Supplementary File S2.

2.3 Network centrality and essential genes

A manually curated list of 481 essential genes was obtained from
SeedGenes v8 (Tzafrir et al., 2003). Degree, shortest path betweenness
and clustering coefﬁcient network centralities were calculated with an
implementation of the JUNG library (Available: http://jung.source-
forge.net). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves (Beck and
Shultz, 1986) were generated for essential genes by using a sliding thresh-
old (r), namely every different degree (meg), betweenness (rm...) and clus-
tering coefﬁcient (r616) values in the population, and then calculating the
number of true positive essential genes above each 1'. Joint centrality
ROC curves were calculated by averaging the ranking in the three cen-
tralities (degree, clustering coefﬁcient and betweenness) for each gene.
Further details are available in the Supplementary material
(Supplementary File S3).

2.4 Ontology enrichment analysis

Mapman ontology term over-representation analyses were performed
using the most recent A.thaliana Mapman TAIR9 mapping (Thimm
et al., 2004) via a Bonferroni-corrected Fisher’s Exact Test (Upton,
1992) as implemented in the CorTo software. Over-represented
Mapman bin pairs (to estimate the functional enrichment in edges)

essentiality (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). For networks derived from
RPKM—normalized data, betweenness is the only parameter sig—
niﬁcantly associated with essentiality, albeit not in high threshold
networks (Fig. 3C), while RNA—seq raw counts and VST—based
networks show again the tendency of essential genes to possess a
high degree and a high betweenness (Fig. 3B and D). The con—
nection with clustering coefﬁcient is lost in larger RNA—seq
networks (Table 2).

In general, essential genes possess a signiﬁcantly higher
betweenness in almost all A.thaliana coexpression networks
(Supplementary File S9), while there seems to be no advantage
in combining all three centralities by average gene ranking
(Fig. 4), an approach used before for essential gene detection
(Joy et al., 2005). It is clear, however, that coexpression network
degree alone, as stated before for degree in proteiniprotein inter—
action networks (W uchty, 2002), is not always a sufﬁcient pre—
dictor for gene essentiality in RNA—seq networks, while it is a
valid predictor in microarray networks.

3.3 Biological insights from coexpression networks

We then functionally annotated and intersected the networks
described in Table 1 and looked at them at a greater detail
(Fig. 4, Supplementary Files S2 and 810). There is a low size
overlap between microarray— and RNA—seq—derived coexpression
networks (Fig. 4A). This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given
the technical low correlation between these two techniques, es—
pecially for high and low transcript abundances (Wang et al.,
2009). However, microarray—derived networks are more similar
to VST—derived ones (12.7% shared edges relative to total micro—
array network size) than those based on RPKM or raw counts
(respectively, 6.2% and 5.0%). Also, the overlap between
RNA—seq networks is constantly below 50% of their total sizes
(Supplementary File 810, the highest overlap is visible between
raw counts and RPKM), posing an interesting caveat about the
comparability of coexpression inferences made with differently
normalized RNA—seq data [the same issue was reported before
for different normalization procedures on microarray data (Lim
et al., 2007)]. Each of the networks derived by our analysis seems
to be focusing on different parts of the cellular transcriptome
(Fig. 4B): for example, microarrays show a high propensity of
coexpression for RNA—processing genes with other functional
areas, and RPKM—based networks describe several transport—
related coexpressions.

An intersection of all networks describes a few backbone coex—
pression structures well known in literature, like the relationship
between cell wall synthesis/degradation and regulation of tran—
scription (Mutwil et al., 2010) or the one between biotic stress
and post—translational modiﬁcation mechanisms (Mishra et al.,
2006). Genes coding for ribosomal proteins are also highly coex—
pressed to each other (Fig. 4B and Supplementary File S2).

One of the great advantages of coexpression analysis is its
possibility to propose novel candidate genes for incompletely
characterized biological pathways (Persson et al., 2005;
Vasilevski et al., 2012). RNA—seq allows a quantitative assess—
ment of the entire transcriptome, therefore extending this type of
inference over genes where microarray—based coexpression inves—
tigations are not an option. One of these genes is Sphavata
(At5g21960), a poorly characterized ethylene—responsive factor

pathway. At the same time, RNA—seq—based coexpression is able
to identify GAUTl, a ai—1,4—galacturonosyltransferase already
known to be active, as RHM2, within the pectin branching me—
tabolism (Sterling et al, 2006).

4 DISCUSSION

Our results describe the first large scale (65 samples) attempt to
use RNA—seq data collected from multiple tissues and experi—
mental conditions for gene network reverse engineering. We
show that coexpression networks generated from this novel
technology are indeed realistic (Fig. 2) and accurate, with accur—
acy increasing together with network stringency, validating the
assumption that RNA—seq—based coexpression is a better—than—
random selector of real biological relationships (Supplementary
File S6). However, our results show that microarray—based coex—
pression networks based on simple correlation achieve a higher
similarity to biological networks, and at the same time show a
low overlap with RNA—seq—based representations (Fig. 4).
Unexpectedly, although Arabidopsis coexpression networks are
generally positive predictors of proteiniprotein interactions, the
overlap is quite small and associated to weak MCCs in all cases
(Fig. 2B).

All RNA—seq networks show a scale—free topology (Fig. 2E) as
previously noted on a smaller dataset (Iancu et al, 2012), but no
RNA—seq dataset allowed to reach microarray—like network qua—
lities, neither as raw counts nor after two popular normalization
procedures (RPKM and VST) (Figs 2 and 3 and Table 1).
VST—normalized data possess microarray—like behaviour with
regards to correlation coefﬁcient distribution and topological
network properties (size and degree distribution, Fig. 2A and
E). Amongst RNA—seq data, VST networks also possess the
highest proximity to microarray networks detected by hierarch—
ical clustering (Supplementary File S4) and edge intersection
(Supplementary File 810). RPKM and raw count networks, per—
haps owing to the heteroscedasticity of these types of data
(Anders and Huber, 2010), differ more markedly from micro—
array networks than VST networks.

We also ﬁnd that coexpression network betweenness centrality
can be calculated from RNA—seq data and used as a positive
marker for A.thaliana essential genes (Table 2). The task of iden—
tifying essential genes has been called the ‘most important task of
genomics—based target validation’ (Chalker and Lunsford, 2002),
as these genes are extremely important not only to understand
the minimal requirements for life (Li et al, 2011), but also
because they are excellent drug targets (Cole, 2002).

Another important application of coexpression analysis is in
the identiﬁcation of novel genes and novel gene functions. To
this respect, we show how RNA—seq data can be complementary
to microarray data in describing the functional neighbourhood
of a pectin metabolism gene (Fig. 5) or to conﬁrm the connection
with jasmonate of a poorly characterized putative transcription
factor (Supplementary File Sll). There are at least 6953
A.thaliana genes annotated on the TAIR10 genome but not rep—
resented by any probeset on the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray
platform; 3578 of these genes have no functional annotationi
neither experimentally inferred, nor predicted in silico (Thimm
et al, 2004%which gives RNA—seq the unique possibility to
functionally investigate a previously uncovered portion of the

transcriptome. This potential can indeed be transposed to
other organisms as well, given the fair conservation of coexpres—
sion across species, at least in the plant kingdom (Movahedi
et al, 2012). All data investigated in this article are preloaded
and can be freely analysed by the CorTo coexpression tool.
Despite its obvious advantages, the unexpected relative under—
performance of RNA—seq versus microarrays in network recon—
struction raises an important caveat on its direct usability for
coexpression analysis, at least by the simple Pearson correlation
criteria used in this work. The creation of novel approaches to
properly normalize and interpret gene count correlations gener—
ated by Next—Generation Sequencing will pose a future
fundamental challenge for coexpression investigators.

Dynamic networks in aging

 

37 039 unique PPIs between the proteins. BioGRID data consist of 10 078
unique proteins and 50 954 unique PPIs between the proteins.

2.1.3 Integrating static PPI network with gene expression data to
form age—speczfic PPI networks We form dynamic age-speciﬁc net-
works as follows. To form a network speciﬁc to a given age, we select in
the static network those proteins that are expressed at that age (Section
2.1.1) and all PPIs that exist between the expressed proteins (see
Supplementary Section $12 for a formal description). Because gene ex-
pression data are collected for 37 ages, 37 age-speciﬁc networks are formed
from the given static network. Because we study two static networks
(HPRD and BioGRID), we obtain two sets of dynamic networks. We
run subsequent analyses on each of the network sets. Because we ﬁnd
that results are similar across the two sets, for simplicity, here we report
results only for the HPRD network. Results for the BioGRID network are
reported in Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figs S2 and S5.

2.1.4 ‘Ground truth’ aging—related data We denote the set of 9426
genes that are present in both the static PPI network (Section 2.1.2) and
brain gene expression data (Section 2.1.1) as StatNetExpression.

By studying the brain gene expression data from Section 2.1.1,
Berchtold et al. (2008) identiﬁed 8277 genes whose expression signiﬁ-
cantly changed with age. Of these, 4520 are present in
StatNetExpression. Henceforth, we denote this ‘ground truth’ aging-
related set of 4520 genes predicted from brain gene expression data
alone as BrainExpression2008Age.

By studying a different brain gene expression data, Lu et al. (2004)
predicted 442 genes as aging-related, as their expression signiﬁcantly cor-
related with age. Of these, 343 genes are present in StatNetExpression.
Henceforth, we denote this ‘ground truth’ aging-related set of 343
genes predicted from brain gene expression data alone as
BrainExpression2004Age.

Clearly, BrainExpression2008Age and BrainExpression2004Age are
similar in the sense that their aging-related genes have been inferred
from brain gene expression data. [And as such, among all ‘ground truth’
data sets (see below), these two sets are expected to be the most similar to
our aging-related predictions, because our predictions are also partly based
on brain human gene expression data.] However, it is important to note
that BrainExpression2008Age and BrainExpression2004Age were pre-
dicted from two independent data sets, and compared with
BrainExpression2004Age, BrainExpression2008Age is a result of a newer
microarray study; it covers more samples and more individuals, and it
covers more samples per individual. And this is exactly why we base our
study (Section 2.1.1) on the expression data by Berchtold et al. (2008)
rather than on the data by Lu et al. (2004).

By studying the brain gene expression data set related to different
stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Simpson et al. (2011) identiﬁed
2911 genes that have signiﬁcantly different expression levels at different
stages of AD. Of these, 1541 are present in StatNetExpression.
Henceforth, we denote this ‘ground truth’ AD-related set of 1541 genes
predicted from brain gene expression data as ADExpressionAge.

In July 2012, GenAge contained 261 human genes that have been
linked to aging as sequence-based orthologs of aging-related genes in
model species (de Magalhaes et al., 2009). Of these, 242 are present in
StatNetExpression. Henceforth, we denote this ‘ground truth’ aging-
related set of 242 genes predicted from sequence data by SequenceAge.

2.1.5 Complements of the ‘ground truth’ aging—related data We
deﬁne a set of genes as the complement of a ‘ground truth’ aging-related
data set if the genes are present in StatNetExpression but not in
the ‘ground truth’ data set. We denote the complements of
BrainExpression2008Age, BrainExpression2004Age, ADExpressionAge
and SequenceAge as BrainExpression2008Complement,
BrainExpression2004 Complement, A DExpress ion Complement and
SequenceComplement, respectively.

All above data sets are deﬁned with respect to HPRD PPI data. For
BioGRID data, see Supplementary Section S13.

2.2 Do global network topologies change with age?

Given the dynamic age-speciﬁc PPI networks, we test whether the overall
(global) topologies of the networks change with age. We do so by compar-
ing the different networks with respect to several commonly used global
network properties (Section 2.2.1), by evaluating the ﬁt of each of the age-
speciﬁc networks to a series of well-known graph families, i.e. network
models (Section 2.2.2) (Kuchaiev et al., 201 1; Milenkovic et al., 2008), and
by measuring the overlap of the age-speciﬁc networks (Section 2.2.3).

2.2.1 Comparing global properties of age—speczfic networks We
analyze three properties: the average clustering coefﬁcient, average diam-
eter and graphlet frequency distribution (Memisevic et al., 2010a). The
properties are deﬁned in Supplementary Section S1.4.

2.2.2 Evaluating the fit of age—speczfic networks to different graph
families or network models We compare the ﬁt of the dynamic PPI
networks to different graph families, i.e. network models (Milenkovic
et al., 2009), to test whether the best ﬁtting model changes with age.
Various network models have been proposed. We use (i) ErdosiRenyi
random graphs (ER), (ii) generalized ErdosiRenyi random graphs with
same degree distribution as the data (ERDD), (iii) geometric random
graphs (GEO), (iv) geometric gene duplication and mutation model
(GEOGD), (v) scale-free networks (SF) and (vi) scale-free gene duplica-
tion and mutation model (SFGD) (Kuchaiev et al., 2011; Milenkovic
et al., 2008). To evaluate the ﬁt of the data network to a given model,
we compare the topology of the data network with the topology of a
random network instance drawn from the model with respect to a
highly constraining measure of network topological similarity called
graphlet degree distribution agreement (PrZulj, 2007). For details, see
Supplementary Section S1.5.

2.2.3 Computing the overlap between age—speczfic networks We
measure the overlap between each pair of age-speciﬁc networks as the per-
centage of nodes (or edges) in the smaller of the two networks that are
common to the two networks. For details, see Supplementary Section S16.

2.3 Do local topologies of proteins change with age?

We study topological positions of proteins in each age-speciﬁc network
with respect to seven node centrality measures (Section 2.3.1). We predict
to be aging-related those proteins whose centralities signiﬁcantly change
with age (Section 2.3.2). We validate our predictions in several ways
(Section 2.3.3).

2.3 .1 Local measures of topology or node centralities Various
centrality measures have been used to link topological importance of a
node in the network to its functional importance. Below, we deﬁne each
of the seven measures that we use and provide biological justiﬁcation for
their use.

Degree centrality (DEGC) measures the degree of a node in the net-
work, i.e. the number of the node’s neighbors. The higher the degree of a
node, the more central the node according to DEGC. Because current
PPI networks have ‘power-law’ degree distributions, with many low-
degree nodes and few high-degree nodes, and because the removal of
the high-degree nodes would impact the network structure (by discon-
necting it), DEGC of a gene has been related to the gene’s essentiality as
well as its involvement in disease (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Sharan and
Ideker, 2008).

Clustering coefficient centrality (CLUSC) measures, for a given node,
how many pairs of neighbors of the node are connected by an edge, out
of all pairs of the node’s neighbors. Intuitively, the more interconnected
the neighborhood of the node, the more central the node is according to

CLUSC. In a PPI network, a node with high-clustering coefﬁcient, to-
gether with the node’s neighbors, forms a highly interconnected network
region, which is likely to correspond to a functional module (Barabasi
and Oltvai, 2004).

K-core of a network is a maximal subset of nodes in the network such
that each node is connected to at least k others in the subset. K-coreness
centrality (KC) of a node is k if the node is in k-core. Nodes with high KC
in the human network have been found to correspond to the ‘core dis-
easeome’ that is significantly enriched in disease genes and drug targets
(Janjic and PrZulj, 2012).

Graphlet degree centrality (GDC) measures how many graphlets a
node participates in, for all 275-node graphlets (Milenkovic et al.,
2011). Intuitively, the more graphlets a node touches, the more central
the node is according to GDC. Because it captures the extended network
neighborhood of a node, GDC is a highly sensitive measure of network
topology. Thus, in a PPI network, proteins with high GDCs represent
potential candidates for therapeutic intervention, as targeting such pro-
teins with drugs would have more signiﬁcant impact on the network
structure than targeting proteins that reside in sparse and non-complex
network regions (Milenkovic et al., 2011). Indeed, GDC has been found
to capture well disease and pathogen-interacting proteins and drug tar-
gets (Milenkovic et al., 2011).

Betweenness centrality (BETWC) measures the involvement of a node
in the shortest paths in the network. Intuitively, nodes that occur in many
shortest paths have high centrality according to BETWC. BETWC of

node v, Cbcm(v), is: Cbcm(v) = Zﬂvﬂeyogg‘l, where V is the set of

 

nodes in the network, a“ is the number of shortest paths between
nodes s and t and m,(v) is the number of shortest paths between s and
t that go through v. In a PPI network, BETWC of a protein indicates the
‘likelihood’ of the protein to participate in pathways connecting all other
proteins (Koschutzki and Schreiber, 2008). Removal of a protein that is
on critical pathways between many other proteins could cause loss of
communication between the proteins. Also, targeting such a node with
a drug could cause the drug effects to spread fast to all the nodes
(Milenkovic et al., 2011). This property has been used to identify genei
disease associations by encoding each gene in the network based on the
distribution of shortest path lengths to all genes associated with disease
(Radivojac et al., 2008).

Closeness centrality (CLOSEC) measures the ‘closeness’ of a node to
all other nodes in the network. Intuitively, nodes with small shortest path
distances to all other nodes have high centrality according to CLOSEC.
CLOSEC of node v, Cdom(v), is: Cdom(v) = W, where o(u, v) is

HEV ‘

the shortest path distance between nodes u and v. In a PPI network,
CLOSEC of a protein indicates the ‘likelihood’ of the protein to reach
or be reachable from all other proteins (Scardoni et al., 2009). And it has
been a widely accepted assumption that proteins that are closer to each
other are more likely to perform the same function (Sharan et al., 2007).

Eccentricity centrality (ECC) is related to CLOSEC, except that it
measures the ‘closeness’ of a node only to the farthest node in the network
(W uchty and Stadler, 2003). Intuitively, nodes with small shortest path
distances to the furthest node in the network have high centrality accord-
ing to ECC. ECC of node v, Cccc(V), is: Cm(v) =

2.3.2 Prediction of aging—related genes For each measure, we com-
pute centrality values for a node in each of the 37 age-speciﬁc networks.
Then, we calculate Pearson or Spearman correlation between the 37 ages
and the node’s 37 centrality values (Supplementary Section S1.7). We do
this for all genes that are active in >20% of the ages in the gene expres-
sion data (Lu et al., 2004). If such a gene is unexpressed at a given age, we
assign it a centrality value of zero at that age. We note that ignoring the
centrality value of an unexpressed gene as opposed to treating it as a zero
value makes no signiﬁcant difference on our results. Also, because results
are consistent for both correlation measures, here we report them only for

Pearson correlation. Results for Spearman correlation are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S4.

We quantify the statistical signiﬁcance of a given correlation value
observed from the data by measuring the probability (i.e. P-value) of
observing by chance a better value (i.e. the same or higher value when
the original value is positive or the same or lower value when the original
value is negative). We do this by randomly reshufﬁing the 37 node cen-
trality values at the 37 ages and by computing the resulting ‘random
correlation’. We repeat this 999999 times to get 999999 random correl-
ations, which in addition to the data correlation totals to 1000 000 cor-
relation values (Phipson and Smyth, 2010). We compute the P-value as
the percentage of the 1000000 values in which the random correlation
(including the data correlation) is better than the data correlation. We
perform multiple test correction of each P-value to control the false-
discovery rate in our predictions (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We
predict a gene to be aging-related if its q-value (the adjusted P-value after
multiple test correction) is <0.01.

Because we study multiple node centralities, each of which can predict
the given gene to be aging-related, we score our predictions so that the
more centrality measures support a prediction and the higher the signiﬁ-
cance of the change of its centrality values with age, the higher the score
and the more credible the prediction. For details, see Supplementary
Section S1.7.

2.3.3 Validation of predicted aging—related genes

Statistical signiﬁcance of our predictions. To test whether our approach
of combining static network data with aging-related expression data into
the dynamic network data actually gives meaningful predictions, we study
whether the number of aging-related genes that we predict from the
actual data is statistically signiﬁcantly larger than the number of aging-
related genes that we predict from ‘randomized data’. By ‘randomized
data’, we mean that we randomize the expression data before integrating
it with the static network data (Supplementary Section S1.8). Then, we
integrate the randomized expression data with the static PPI network,
construct randomized age-speciﬁc networks just as in Section 2.1.3 and
predict aging-related genes from the randomized networks just as in
Section 2.3.2. We repeat the above procedure multiple times, to assign
a P-value to the number of predictions that we make from the actual data
(Supplementary Section S1.8).

Overlap between genes of different data sets. We measure the statistical
signiﬁcance of the overlap between genes of two data sets by using the
hypergeometric test, which computes probability P (i.e. P-value) of obser-
ving the same or larger overlap by chance as follows. Let E be the set of
genes from StatNetExpression. Let A be the subset of genes from E that
are in any one of the data sets. Let G be the subset of genes from E that
are in the other data set. Let 0 be the overlap between A and G. Then:

10171 (lfl)(lElc-_lzlt_l)
p = 1 —  ‘EH ‘ We use the P-value threshold of 0.05.
1: 1m

Gene Ontology enrichment. We study the enrichment of a data set in
biological process Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Ashburner et al., 2000).
We use (i) all 5450 GO terms that annotate (independent on the evidence
code) at least two genes from StatNetExpression and (ii) 2392 GO terms
that annotate (with respect to an experimental evidence code only) at least
two genes from StatNetExpression. For a GO term g, we compute the
statistical signiﬁcance of its enrichment via the above hypergeometric test
formula, where now E is the set of genes from StatNetExpression that are
annotated by any GO term, A is the gene set in which we are measuring
GO term enrichment, G is the subset of genes from E that are annotated
by GO term g and 0 is the set of genes in the overlap between A and G.
We use the P-value threshold of 0.05.

GO term overlap. We measure the statistical signiﬁcance of the overlap
of GO terms enriched in one data set and GO terms enriched in another
data set via the above hypergeometric test formula, where now E is the set
of GO terms that annotate at least two genes from StatNetExpression, A

is the set of GO terms enriched in any one of the two data sets, G is the set
of GO terms enriched in the other data set and 0 is the set of GO terms
that are in the overlap between A and G. We use the P-value threshold
of 0.05.

Disease Ontology enrichment. We study the enrichment of a data set in
all 527 Disease Ontology (DO) terms that annotate at least two genes
from StatNetExpression (Du et al., 2009) in the same way as when we
study GO term enrichments.

DO term overlap. We study the overlap of DO terms from different
data sets in the same way as when we study GO term overlaps.

literature validation. We automatically search for a gene in PubMed
(http://www.pubmed.gov) and consider the gene to be validated in
the context of aging if its name is mentioned (according to NCBI’s
E-utilities 7 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500) with ‘age’,
‘aging’ or ‘ageing’ in the title or abstract of at least one article. Also,
we manually search for a gene by reading relevant PubMed articles more
closely.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We study global topologies of the age—speciﬁc networks in
Section 3.1. We study local topologies of proteins in each net—
work and predict aging—related genes in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
We validate our predictions in Section 3.2.3.

3.1 Global network topologies do not change with age

3.1.1 Global properties of age—specific networks are
similar Average clustering coefﬁcients, average diameters and
graphlet frequency distributions (Section 2.2.1) of the age—
speciﬁc networks do not signiﬁcantly change with age
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).

3.1.2 Networks at different ages belong to the same graph
family We compare the ﬁt of the age—speciﬁc networks to six
network models (Section 2.2.2). The best—ﬁtting model does not
change with age (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Note that our
primary goal is not to identify the best—ﬁtting model for dynamic
PPI networks. Nonetheless, consistent with results for static PPI
networks (Kuchaiev et al., 2011; Przulj et al., 2010; Ratmann
et al., 2009), it is gene duplication models that fit the age—speciﬁc
networks the best.

3.1.3 Overlap of age—specific networks is large The age—speciﬁc
networks share on average 92% of the nodes and 89% of the
edges, depending on age, whereas every pair of the networks
shares at least 82% of the nodes and 74% of the edges
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Hence, the network overlaps are
quite large.

3.2 Local topologies of proteins do change with age

3.2.1 Prediction of aging—related genes Depending on a study,
gene expression data alone can reveal as few as 442 (Lu et al.,
2004) or as many as 8277 (Berchtold et al., 2008) of the human
genes as aging—related. We integrate the gene expression data
(Berchtold et al., 2008) with the human PPI network, forming
dynamic age—speciﬁc networks, to investigate whether data inte—
gration can contribute to our understanding of aging. While
global network analysis has failed to uncover any aging—related
information, it could be that the dynamic network data encode
aging—related information only locally and around only a subset

of nodes. Therefore, we use centrality measures (Section 2.3.1) to
quantify local positions of nodes in the age—speciﬁc networks and
ﬁnd nodes whose centralities correlate well with age; as such
proteins could be key players in aging.

We predict a gene to be aging—related if its centrality values are
statistically significantly correlated with age (Section 2.3.2) for at
least one centrality measure. This results in 537 (5.7%) predic—
tions out of all 9426 genes. Fig. 2a shows the number of aging—re—
lated predictions for each centrality individually and all
centralities combined. Some measures, and GDC in particular,
are superior to others in terms of the number of their aging—
related predictions. Importantly, GDC is a sensitive measure of
network topology, as it captures the extended network neighbor—
hood around a node. As such, its superiority is not necesarily
surprising (Milenkovic et al., 2011).

A gene’s centrality can be positively correlated with age (the
gene becomes more network—central with age) or it can be nega—
tively correlated with age (the gene becomes less network—central
with age). Interestingly, even though it has already been argued
that aging is associated with failure of ‘hubs’, highly intercon—
nected and thus network—central proteins (Soltow et al., 2010),
the majority of our predictions are positively correlated with age
(Fig. 2).

3.2.2 Relationships and potential redundancies of different node
centralities We predict a gene to be aging—related if its central—
ity values correlate well with age with respect to at least one
centrality. So, we study whether any genes are predicted by
more than one or even all of the centralities. We ﬁnd that
almost half (47%) of the 537 aging—related predictions are sup—
ported by multiple centralities, while the remaining predictions
are supported by a single centrality (Fig. 2b). As expected, the
number of predictions decreases as the number of centralities
supporting the predictions increases.

We study redundancies of the different centralities by comput—
ing, for each pair of centralities, the correlation between their
centrality values over all nodes in a network, and by averaging
correlations over the 37 age—speciﬁc networks. We observe
high correlations between some measures, such as BETWC,
DEGC, KC and GDC or CLOSEC and ECC (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Section S2.l). Thus, some centralities appear to
be redundant to others.

When we study pairwise overlaps of aging—related predictions
produced by the different centralities, we still observe high over—
laps between some (though not all) centralities (Fig. 3b). For
example, each prediction made by ECC is supported by at
least one other centrality measure. The overlaps are encouraging,
as they increase the credibility of predictions supported by mul—
tiple centrality measures.

Yet, given that the majority (~53 %) of the predictions are
identiﬁed by a single centrality (Fig. 2b), it seems that not all
centralities are redundant to each other. And when we focus on
our aging—related genes predicted by exactly one centrality, in
most cases, these predictions are not even marginally signiﬁcant
with respect to other centralities (Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Fig. S6), indicating again that the different centralities are in
general not redundant to each other. Thus, we keep all 537 pre—
dictions, independent on the number of centralities supporting
them. Henceforth, we denote this set of 537 aging—related genes

type i PPIs. (But, by no means do we claim to identify all aging—
related genes.)

Because ‘ground truth’ data are predicted computationally,
they could be noisy. Also, different ‘ground truth’ sets could
be biased toward different data types from which the predictions
have been made, be it expression, sequence or PPI data. Because
different data types could be capturing different functional slices
of the cell (Memisevic et al., 2010b; Przytycka and Kim, 2010), it
might not be alarming if overlaps between the different ‘ground
truth’ sets are not large. However, because all the sets aim to
capture the same biological phenomenon (aging), some overlap
should exist. Ideally, one would hope for a statistically significant
overlap. However, the existence of any (even non—significant)
overlap would be encouraging, because (i) the overlap could be
low due to the noisiness of each ‘ground truth’ set and (ii) stat—
istically non—significant results may be biologically important,
whereas statistically significant results may not be (Ho et al.,
2010; Milenkovic et al., 2010).

We measure the overlap of DyNetAge with four ‘ground truth’
data sets: BrainExpression2008Age, BrainExpression2004Age,
ADExpressionAge and SequenceAge (Section 2.1.4). Of the
four, BrainExpression2008Age and BrainExpression2004Age are
the most likely to be similar to DyNetAge (as all three are based
on brain—related data, brain—related gene expression data and brain
aging—related gene expression data; Supplementary Section S22),
followed by ADExpressionAge (as our predictions as well as these
data are both based on brain—related data and brain—related gene
expression data), followed by SequenceAge (as our predictions
and these data both capture aging—related information but from
different data types) (Section 2.1.4). Therefore, a high overlap of
DyNetAge with BrainExpression2008Age or BrainExpressio—
n2004Age would validate our method. A high overlap with
ADExpressionAge would suggest that our method could capture
not only brain aging—related genes but also brain aging—related
disease genes. A high overlap with SequenceAge would suggest
that our method could capture genes identiﬁed from a different
data type, namely, sequence data.

And this is exactly what we observe in general (Supplementary
Fig. S8 and Supplementary Table S4). DyNetAge’s overlap is
statistically signiﬁcant for BrainExpression2008Age, Brain—
Expression2004Age and ADExpressionAge, and marginally sig—
niﬁcant for SequenceAge (Table l). The (marginally) significant
overlap between DyNetAge and all four ‘ground truth’ data sets
is encouraging. Importantly, even though most of the overlaps
are significant, 26%, 94%, 78% and 96% of our DyNetAge
predictions are not in BrainExpression2008Age, BrainExpressio—
n2004Age, ADExpressionAge and SequenceAge, respectively,
and 20% of our predictions are not in any of the four data
sets (Supplementary Table S5). This confirms that data integra—
tion can reveal additional knowledge compared with studying
individual data types.

Recall that the complement of each ‘ground truth’ data set
(including DyNetAge) is the set of genes not predicted as
aging—related by the given study (Section 2.1.5). Hence, it
would be encouraging to see (i) low (non—signiﬁcant) overlaps
between DyNetAge and complements of the ‘ground truth’
data sets, (ii) low (non—signiﬁcant) overlaps between
DyNetComplement and ‘ground truth’ sets and (iii) high (signiﬁ—
cant) overlaps between DyNetComplement and complements of

‘ground truth’ sets. This is what we typically observe in all three
cases (Supplementary Table S4).

GO enrichment. Two—hundred thirty—three GO terms are sig—
niﬁcantly enriched in DyNetAge (P—values between 0.049 and
5 x 10*), whereas only 9 GO terms are enriched in
DyNetComplement (P—values between 0.043 and 6.5 x 104)
(Section 2.3.3). Of aging—related GO terms, it is encouraging
that DyNetAge is marginally signiﬁcantly enriched in cell aging
(P—value of 0.052) as well as (though not signiﬁcantly) in aging,
multicellular organismal aging and cellular senescence.
Importantly, DyNetAge’s performance in this context is typically
comparable with that of the ‘ground truth’ data, especially when
using only gene—GO term associations obtained by experimental
evidence codes (Supplementary Section $2.3).

GO overlap. Our predictions are further validated by (i) high
GO term overlaps between DyNetAge and the ‘ground truth’
data sets, (ii) low GO term overlaps between DyNetAge and
complements of the ‘ground truth’ sets, (iii) low GO term overlaps
between DyNetComplement and the ‘ground truth’ sets and (iv)
high GO term overlaps between DyNetComplement and comple—
ments of the ‘ground truth’ sets (Table l and Supplementary
Table S6). For example, when considering gene—GO term associ—
ations of any evidence code, GO terms from DyNetAge signiﬁ—
cantly overlap with G0 terms from three of the four ‘ground
truth’ sets (BrainExpression2008Age, BrainExpression2004Age
and SequenceAge), and some (though non—signiﬁcant) overlap
with G0 terms from ADExpressionAge is also encouraging
(Table 1). Results when considering gene—GO term associations
of experimental evidence codes are shown in Supplementary
Table S7. Importantly, GO term overlap is signiﬁcant between
DyNetAge and BrainExpressionAge2008, whereas it is non—sig—
niﬁcant between SequenceAge and BrainExpressionAge2008,
indicating the superiority of DyNetAge over SequenceAge in
this context (Supplementary Section S2.4).

DO enrichment. Twelve diseases are signiﬁcantly enriched in
DyNetAge (P—values between 0.048 and 1.5 x 103), whereas no
disease is enriched in DyNetComplement (Section 2.3.3). The 12
diseases in DyNetAge are pemphigoid bullous, lupus erythemato—
sus, infection by Cryptococcus neoformans, capillaries disease,
WiskottiAldrich syndrome, KuhntiJunius degeneration, carcin—
oma, Rett syndrome, skin cancer, infection, myeloproliferative dis—
ease and IgA glomerulonephritis. KuhntiJunius degeneration,

lupus erythematosus, myeloproliferative disease and skin cancer
are not only enriched in SequenceAge as well but these disease
have also been explicitly linked to aging in the literature
[PubMed IDs (PMIDs): 11587915, 11318593, 24138668 and
17942417, respectively]. Pemphigoid bullous is not only enriched
in BrainExpression2008Age as well but this disease also shows
increased risk in old patients (PMID: 10426901). Rett syndrome
is not only enriched in BrainExpression2004Age as well but this
disease also shows aging—related changes in physiological pro—
cesses of patients (PMID: 11247011). Supplementary Table S8
maps the PMIDs to full—paper references. Importantly, even five
of the six diseases from DyNetAge that are missed by all ‘ground
truth’ sets can all be linked to aging in the literature as well
(Supplementary Section $2.5).

DO overlap. We further validate our predictions by
demonstrating (i) high DO term overlaps between DyNetAge
and the ‘ground truth’ data sets, (ii) low DO term overlaps be—
tween DyNetAge and complements of the ‘ground truth’ sets,
(iii) low DO term overlaps between DyNetComplement and the
‘ground truth’ sets and (iv) high DO term overlaps between
DyNetComplement and complements of the ‘ground truth’ sets
(Supplementary Table S9). It is encouraging that DO terms from
DyNetAge overlap with DO terms from BrainExpressio—
nAge2008, BrainExpressionAge2004 and SequenceAge (though
the overlaps are non—significant) (Table 1). Importantly, diseases
from DyNetAge do not signiﬁcantly overlap with diseases from
complements of the ‘ground truth’ sets, whereas diseases from
SequenceAge do signiﬁcantly overlap with diseases from both
BrainExpression2008Age and ADExpressionAge. This indicates
superiority of DyNetAge over SequenceAge in this context. For
details, see Supplementary Section S2.6.

Literature validation. Automatic literature validation (Section
2.3.3) is prone to errors: we ‘validate’ in this manner equal por—
tion of each ‘ground truth’ aging—related set and its complement.
Therefore, we aim to validate our predictions manually (Section
2.3.3). Because manual validation is laborious, we focus on our
10% highest—scoring predictions (Section 2.3.2). Of these, we
study all eight predictions that are absent from any ‘ground
truth’ set, namely, CD22, CTRL, HMG20B, TRIM21,
UBA52, USP45, OXSRl and POLE2. Importantly, we success—
fully validate all these genes as follows. An aging—associated de—
cline has been found in B cell precursors of bone marrow,
whereas CD22 is one of the markers of B cell precursors
(PMID: 19967915). An aging—dependent degradation has been
found in CTRL that affects chymotrypsin—like activity in the
retina (PMID: 17258201). HMG20B is regulated by the activity
of BRCA2 tumor suppressor, whereas cancers and tumors are
known to be aging—associated diseases (PMID: 21399666).
TRIM21 is involved in a pathway that acts as a potential
driver of lung tumorigenesis, whereas cancers and tumors are
known to be aging—associated diseases (PMID: 21399661).
UBA52 has been found to be significantly downregulated with
respect to aging—associated degenerative diseases of the eye
(PMID: 23601964). Aging—related changes have been found in
the ubiquitiniproteasome system, whereas USP45 belongs to the
ubiquitin—speciﬁc protease gene family (PMID: 12944592). It has
been found that oxidative stress responsive transcription factor
pathway is activated during aging in cardiac muscle (PMID:
9011632), whereas OXSRl performs oxidative stress responsive

function. Finally, mutations in POLE2 have been found to be
linked to human colorectal cancer, whereas cancers and tumors
are known to be aging—associated diseases (PMID: 20065316).

As a negative control for literature search, we also aim to
validate genes from DyNetComplement, in hope that their val—
idation rate will be lower than the validation rate of the above
eight highest—scoring predictions. For a fair evaluation, we arbi—
trarily select eight lowest—scoring genes from
DyNetComplement, and we perform manual literature valid—
ation on these genes in the same manner as for the above eight
highest—scoring predictions. As we had hoped, we ﬁnd only one
of them to be aging—related, which further increases conﬁdence in
our aging—related predictions from DyNetAge. For details, see
Supplementary Section S27.

3.3 Robustness to the choice of gene expression data

To validate the robustness of our approach, we also base our
predictions on an alternative gene expression data obtained by
RNA—seq instead of microarray technology (Section 2.1.1), in the
hope that the resulting predictions (which we denote by
DyNetAgeRNASeq) will significantly overlap with the ‘ground
truth’ data (including DyNetAge). Indeed, 172 predictions from
DyNetAgeRNASeq (Supplementary Table S3) signiﬁcantly
overlap with BrainExpressionAge2008 (P—value of 1.7 x 10’3),
BrainExpressionAge2004 (P—value of 0.01) and
ADExpressionAge (P—value of 3.9 x 103). Also, they overlap
(though not significantly) with SequenceAge and DyNetAge.
Existence of any (even non—signiﬁcant) overlap is still encoura—
ging (Section 3.2.3). Thus, our approach results in meaningful
predictions independent on the choice of the data.

4 CONCLUSION

Together, our results conﬁrm that dynamic PPI network analysis
via integration of static PPI network data with aging—related gene
expression data can reveal meaningful key players in aging.

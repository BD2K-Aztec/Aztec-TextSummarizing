candidate enzyme target is able to return the concentration
of UA to <105% of the healthy levels. The adverse effect
objective consists of ensuring that the least—square error between
the remedied metabolite concentration and its corresponding
healthy levels is small. Furthermore, the drug dose objective
is based on the fact that higher enzyme activities imply using a
lower dose of drugs, and low drug doses minimize adverse
effects.

In this study, we introduce a fuzzy multi—objective optimiza—
tion approach to formulate the enzyme target design problem
for drug discovery. The design problem is a uniﬁed optimization
framework, in which the identiﬁcation of enzyme targets is
combined with multi—criteria decision—making to identify
enzyme targets for curing hyperuricemia caused by PRPPS
overactivity and HGPRT deﬁciency. In this work, we not only
consider the therapeutic effect and adverse effect objectives, but
also the minimum effective dose (MED) to represent the low
dose objective. The MED is defined as the lowest dose level
of a pharmaceutical product that provides a clinically signiﬁcant
response with average efﬁcacy, and that is also signiﬁcantly
superior to the response provided by the placebo (Fillon,
1995). Although fuzzy multi—objective optimization approaches
have been applied to the enzyme intervention problem metabolic
networks of microbe (Wu et al., 2011), almost no literature has
so far discussed the approach for evaluating therapeutic effect,
adverse effect and MED, simultaneously, to combine the detec—
tion of candidate enzyme targets and decision—making to select
satisfactory targets.

2 METHODS
2.1 Kinetic model

The dynamics of a metabolic network can be generically governed by a
set of nonlinear differential equations with the following structure:

% = Nv(x, a) (l)
where x e R” is a vector of the concentrations of metabolites or pools, a e
R" is a vector of the enzyme levels corresponding to the enzyme activities,
v e R" is a vector of reaction rates and N e R”“ is the stoichiometric
matrix describing the interconnecting ﬂuxes. The stoichiometric property
of a network is time invariant. Each reaction rate in this study was
expressed based on the power-law function in Equation (2).

n (2)

where ak is the rate constant or enzyme activity for the k’h reaction rate
and gk, are the kinetic orders. The rate constant ak in Equation (2) was
also expressed as a ratio yk of its healthy state ails to easily modulate the
enzyme activity in the following drug discovery problem.

2.2 Fuzzy equal metabolic adjustment problem

As mentioned in the introduction, the OPDD is a two-stage procedure
used to identify enzyme targets for remedying hyperuricemia (Vera et al.,
2007). We introduce a fuzzy equal metabolic adjustment (FEMA)
problem, which is a uniﬁed optimization framework that combines
the detection of candidate enzyme targets and decision-making to select

satisfactory targets in one framework. The FEMA framework is
described as the following formulation.

The three fuzzy equals in Equation (3) are applied to evaluate therapeutic
effect, adverse effect and MED, simultaneously, combining the detection
of candidate enzyme targets and decision-making to select satisfactory
targets. Fuzzy equal operation, which is different from traditional opti-
mization problems, is applied as an index for evaluating therapeutic
effect, as well as adverse effect and MED, that is used in identifying
enzyme targets to restore the desired metabolite concentrations to their
corresponding healthy levels as close as possible. The second and third
fuzzy equal objectives in Equation (3) serve as the measures for decision
making. In the second objective, the metabolite concentrations are used
to evaluate adverse effects. However, the therapeutic effect set 52” is
different from the adverse effect set QAE. In the MED objective of
fuzzy equal objectives, each enzyme activity (i.e. the rate constant of
the GMA model) is assumed to be as close to its healthy level as possible.
The logarithmic expression 12‘. = ln(y,‘.) of the rate constant ratio yk is
used in the FEMA formulation to modulate the enzyme activity.

Each rate equation shown in Equation (2) was formulated as the
power-law expression. This expression may result in a computational
failure when a concentration approaches zero. We used the exponential
relationship in Equation (4) to prevent this numerical problem. Here, the
logarithmic expression of the healthy enzyme activity is deﬁned as
64” = ln(ozf5). The ﬁrst inequality constraint in Equation (5) is used
to restrict each metabolite concentration within its corresponding lower
and upper bounds. A binary variable zk is embedded in the second in-
equality constraint to determine whether the enzyme target is modulated
or not. The last inequality is used as a control indicator for enumerating
alternative enzyme targets from the FEMA problem. Here, K is the
allowable number of enzymes that can be selected in the modulated set
52E”: to be modulated, e.g. K: 2 means that we can select two enzymes
from the modulated set. The last inequality in Equation (5) is SK— 1,
which is used to enumerate alternate enzyme targets. Therefore, the
selected candidate targets at the current iteration should be at least one
enzyme different from the candidate targets obtained in the previous
iterations. The set 95“ corresponds to the set of candidate enzyme

targets selected in the previous k’h iterations. Here, NT is the number of
iterations used to solve the FEMA problem.

2.3 Solving strategy

To solve the FEMA problem, we ﬁrst deﬁne a membership function for
each fuzzy equal objective to quantify each corresponding satisfactory
grade. The membership function is described in Equation (6) as a two-
side function:

LB
0, X,» 5 XI»

1, Xfaml. LB 2 Xgmml. UB 

71200) =
de, X?a.\'al.UB S Xi S XiL/B
0, X,» Z XiUB

The membership function on the left-hand side is a strictly monoton-
ically increasing function d?‘. In contrast, the right-hand side is a strictly
monotonically decreasing function de. Sakawa (1993) proposed ﬁve
types of membership functions: linear, exponential, hyperbolic inverse
and piecewise linear functions, to quantify the behavior of fuzzy object-
ives or constraints. For concise illustration of the FEMA problem, the
linear membership function of each fuzzy equal objective is shown in the
Supplementary Additional File 1. Here, XI.” and XiUB are the lower and
upper bounds of the it“ metabolite concentration or enzyme activity pro-
vided by the user. The satisfactory grade or membership function value is
equal to 1 if the corresponding metabolite concentration or enzyme ac-
tivity is between xf““‘“’~” anng’““'“l‘UB, and the small lower and upper
bounds are near the basal value Xf‘m”. The satisfactory grade is 0 if the
metabolite concentration or enzyme activity is beyond its lower or upper
bounds. The satisfactory grade is between 0 and 1 if the metabolite con-
centration or enzyme activity is within its range.

The FEMA problem is used to ﬁnd the metabolite concentrations,
enzyme activities and selection variables that ensure that the fuzzy
equal objectives are as close to their healthy levels as possible. Having
elicited the membership functions for each fuzzy equal objective, the
FEMA problem is then transferred to the maximizing decision problem,
max min{ni(Xi)a le(Xj)a TIAWU}

X.r..zy»e\ll

where the crisp feasible domain \11 consists of the kinetic model in
Equation (4) and inequality constraints in Equation (5). The maximizing
decision problem is used to ﬁnd the maximum intersection of the fuzzy
equal objectives. The intersection of the fuzzy equal objectives is con-
ducted according to the minimization operation, which is a discontinuous
function. Thus, the maximizing decision problem can be rewritten as the
equivalent problem to avoid a discontinuous computation.

A.(x.i‘..zf)ew

n,»(X,») : A, ie 52” (7)
T]j(Xj) : A, j e 52”

The advantage of this approach is that the optimal membership grade
corresponds to the satisfactory level for each objective, and the optimal

decision A represents the overall satisfactory grade (equivalent to the
lower bound) of the problem.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Design conditions

The kinetic model of the purine metabolic pathway described in
Curto et a]. (1998) was expressed based on a GMA formulation
consisting of 16 dependent variables, 1 diet control variable

(ribose—5—phospahate, R5P), 1 constant variable (phosphate, Pi)
and 28 independent variables for modulating enzyme activities.
Detailed information regarding this model is included in
Supplementary Additional File 2. The model equations were
accessed from the BioModels Database (Li et al., 2010a, b; Le
Novere et al., 2006). Generally, human hyperuricemia is caused
by either PRPPS overactivity or HGPRT deﬁciency (which is
related to LeschiNyhan disease). These two pathologic cases
were considered in this study. In the first case, we assumed
that the activity of PRPPS doubled its healthy level (Vera
et al., 2007). In the second case (HGPRT deﬁciency), we
assumed that both rate constants of guanine phosphoribosyl—
transferase (GPRT) and hypoxantine phosphoribosyltransferase
(HPRT) were 1% of their healthy values (Curto et al., 1998).
Using these pathological states, the abnormal UA concentrations
caused by PRPPS—related hyperuricemiain and LeschiNyhan
disease were 131.0 and 145.5 uM, respectively. By contrast, the
UA concentration in the healthy state was 100.3 uM.

Considering the therapeutic effect of target enzyme selection,
the upper limit of UA was set as 105% of the healthy—state value.
To prevent neuronal toxicity, the upper limits of hypoxanthine
and XA were set as 120% of the healthy state value. Other me—
tabolites were allowed to vary between 0.5 and 10 times their
normal values. The combination of diet control was also con—
sidered, and we set a constraint for the concentration of R5P to
be between 0.5 and 1.5 times the normal intake concentrations.
The enzyme activities were restricted to be 0.172 times their
normal state values. We used various allowable numbers of
enzymes for the FEMA problem to determine optimal enzyme
targets with or without the prescribed diet control. The FEMA
problem can be used to enumerate alternative optimal enzyme
targets; therefore, we performed 10 iterations for each run to
obtain a set of optimal enzyme targets. All optimization prob—
lems were solved using the BONMIN and KNITRO solvers
accessed from GAMS (version 23.8) on a 3.07GHz Intel Core
i7 CPU with 12 GB of RAM.

3.2 Pathological state caused by PRPPS overactivity

We ﬁrst used the therapeutic effect objective only for UA [i.e. the
ﬁrst fuzzy objective in Equation (3)] to identify candidate enzyme
targets, and make a posterior decision to choose treatment tar—
gets. This computation was similar to the two—stage design of the
OPDD. In the first stage, the satisfactory grade of the therapeutic
effect objective for each run was ~ 100%. The next stage involved
computing the membership grade for each metabolite and
enzyme, and choosing the lowest grade (equivalent to minimum
satisfaction) from the set of corresponding grades as the adverse
effect objective and MED objective to choose treatment targets.
The computational satisfaction values between adverse effects
and MED considered without or with prescription of diet control
are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The color figures are
shown in Supplementary Additional File 3. In practice, it was
difﬁcult to simultaneously apply both objectives to make a deci—
sion because some targets had a higher membership grade of the
adverse effect objective but accompanying with a lower grade of
the MED objective, or vice—versa.

Detecting enzyme targets

 

enzymes selected by using FEMA were not covered by the
current medications for hyperuricemia, but they may be good
candidates for new drugs development.

The concentration of UA, the pool of inosine derivatives (HX)
and XA in the healthy state were 100.3, 9.5 and 5.1 pM, respect—
ively. The concentrations of UA, HX and XA in the hyperur—
icemic state caused by PRPPS overactivity were 131.0, 40.3 and
14.8 pM, respectively. The concentrations of UA, HX and XA in
LeschiNyhan disease were 145.4, 69.8 and 22.5 pM, respectively.
A higher concentration of HX and XA has a higher probability
of causing a cytopathic effect (Palmour et al., 1989). Leschi
Nyhan disease exhibits a higher concentration of HX and XA,
which may explain the neurological effects of this disease (Visser
et al, 2000). The adjustment of enzyme targets identiﬁed by
using the triple—objective FEMA could not only reduce the con—
centration of UA, but also those of HX and XA.

Allopurinol is currently the main drug for hyperuricemia in
patients with LeschiNyhan disease (Jinnah et al, 2010).
However, even with optimal medical care, individuals with
LeschiNyhan disease typically live into their third or even
forth decade of life and few patients live beyond 40 years
(Neychev and Jinnah, 2006). According to the computational
results, one enzyme target failed to cure hyperuricemia of
LeschiNyhan disease. Nevertheless, diet control with four
enzyme targets, namely {ada, dnaa, gnuc, hxd}, reduced the con—
centration of UA, HX and XA from 145.4, 69.8 and 22.5 pM to
102.9, 11.1 and 5.6 pM, respectively. This result indicates that the
combination of multi—enzyme targets may be beneficial to treat
LeschiNyhan disease, and points out a direction to develop new
medications.

5 CONCLUSION

We introduce fuzzy programming in which the detection of can—
didate enzyme targets is combined with decision—making strate—
gies to create a uniﬁed optimization framework for determining
satisfactory targets. This optimal enzyme target design problem
is indeed a multi—criteria decision—making problem. A multi—ob—
jective optimization method can be generally applied to find the
Pareto front for this decision problem, and such Pareto solutions
are provided for the designer using his/her biological knowledge
to decide candidate enzyme targets. Almost no literature has so
far discussed the fuzzy equal operation in the FEMA problem to
simultaneously evaluate therapeutic effect, adverse effect and
MED. Furthermore, the membership function deﬁned in fuzzy
programming can be referred to as an index for determining how
to achieve satisfactory levels in the design.

The FEMA approach can also be applied for drug develop—
ment for other metabolic diseases. Using multiple objectives
enables managing various effects, such as therapeutic effects,
adverse effects and MED, and the weighting factor for each
objective in a uniﬁed optimization framework. The objectives
in the FEMA framework can be compromised to obtain a
satisfactory result. Furthermore, the concentrations of metabol—
ites in the human body are not ﬁxed, but ﬁuctuate within
normal ranges. As a result, boundaries for each objective and
constraint are not sharply deﬁned. Fuzzy programming has the
advantage of enabling the management of these ﬁexible
conditions.

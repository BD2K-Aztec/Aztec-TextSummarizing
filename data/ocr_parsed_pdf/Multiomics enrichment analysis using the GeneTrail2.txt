Abstract

Motivation: Gene set analysis has revolutionized the interpretation of high—throughput transcrip—
tomic data. Nowadays, with comprehensive studies that measure multiple —omics from the same
sample, powerful tools forthe integrative analysis of multi—omics datasets are required.

Results: Here, we present GeneTrailZ, a web service allowing the integrated analysis of transcrip—
tomic, miRNomic, genomic and proteomic datasets. It offers multiple statistical tests, a large num—
ber of predefined reference sets, as well as a comprehensive collection of biological categories and
enables direct comparisons between the computed results. We used GeneTrailZ to explore patho—
genic mechanisms of Wilms tumors. We not only succeeded in revealing signaling cascades that
may contribute to the malignancy of blastemal subtype tumors but also identified potential bio—
markers for nephroblastoma with adverse prognosis. The presented use—case demonstrates that
GeneTrailZ is well equipped for the integrative analysis of comprehensive —omics data and may
help to shed light on complex pathogenic mechanisms in cancer and other diseases.

1 Introduction

The advent of high-throughput analysis technologies during the
last decades has revolutionized biology and medicine and has lead to
a tremendous increase in the amount of available, high-dimensional bio-
logical data. However, technologies like microarrays, next-generation
sequencing or mass spectrometry are highly sensitive to changes in the
experimental conditions or protocols, giving rise to technological noise
that must be carefully accounted for (Leek et (11., 2010). Due to the

above reasons, the development of automated and robust statistical ana-
lysis methods for high-throughput data has become a necessity.
Enrichment methods are one fundamental class of analysis procedures
for the study of pathogenic mechanisms and the identification of deregu-
lated pathways and categories. Widely-applied enrichment methods are
Over Representation Analysis (ORA) (Dréghici et (11., 2003) and Gene
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et (11., 2005). Other
approaches, e.g. Kim and Volsky (2005), Newton et a1. (2007), Tian

Supplementary Note S2.2). This leads to a higher resolution of the
computed P—values and very low computation times (see Section
2.4). For an in—depth discussion of the advantages and disadvantages
of the respective methods we refer the reader to Tian et al. (2005).
The phenotype strategy always requires that a permutation test is
performed. As new identifier—level scores must be derived for every
permutation, the method can only be used if a data matrix was
supplied.

Finally, a method for multiple testing correction must be chosen.
To this end, we provide a large set of correction methods (see
Supplementary Table S6) including the popular Benjamini—
Hochberg FDR adjustment (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

2.3.5 Examining computed results

Enrichments can be visualized online or downloaded as compressed
archives and MS Excel tables. When viewing an enrichment online,
we provide detailed statistics about significant categories and their
members, which are fully sort— and searchable. Besides the trad—
itional list of significant categories, we also offer an inverse enrich-
ment view, which for every gene displays the significant categories it
is a member of. In addition, the user can select a set of enrichments
that can be viewed side—by—side, providing a compact and clearly
arranged overview. This allows to quickly detect similarities and dif—
ferences with respect to the detected categories. Here, two view
modes are available. While the union mode displays all categories
that are significant in at least one enrichment, the intersection mode
only displays categories that are significant in all enrichments.
Whereas the union is useful for detecting variability between related
enrichments, the intersection can be used to reduce the number of
false positives by computing and comparing two or more enrich—
ments using different algorithms. Using these modes, the user is able
to effectively balance the sensitivity and specificity of an analysis in
a straightforward manner. Combining the side—by—side view with
GeneTrail2’s mapping features allows for an integrated analysis of
gene lists obtained from different —0mics. For example, given tran—
scriptomics and proteomics data, protein abundance scores can be
mapped onto the corresponding genes allowing to compute enrich—
ments using gene categories for both score lists. Via the union mode
it is possible to spot similarities and differences between the enrich—
ments obtained from both —0mics.

2.4 Performance

The performance of basic tools such as enrichment methods is crit—
ical, as good performance significantly shortens the development
cycles of data analysis workflows. To this end, GeneTrail2 uses a
C ++ implementation to guarantee optimal performance. In general,
the gene set strategy is one order of magnitude quicker to compute
than the phenotype strategy (see Table 1). The used set—level statis—
tics has little influence on the computation time. GeneTrail2 signifi—
cantly outperforms the Broad Institute GSEA application
(Subramanian et al., 2005) for both, the gene set and the phenotype
strategy.

3 Results

3.1 Case study: Wilms tumors

Wilms tumors (WTs), or nephroblastomas, are childhood renal
tumors. While in general WTs are associated with survival rates
>90%, some subtypes with much higher relapse rates are known
(Sredni et al., 2009). For proper risk—assessment and therapy

stratification it is thus crucial to identify and understand the differ—
ences in the pathogenic processes between the tumor subtypes.

We used GeneTrail2 to analyze a WT expression dataset in order
to determine key players influencing the malignancy of WT5. The
dataset consists of 40 mRNA and 47 miRNA expression profiles
from 47 tumor biopsies from 39 patients, containing four healthy
tissue samples as well as 17 blastemal, nine mixed type and 17 mis—
cellaneous tumor samples (cf. Supplementary Section S3.1). As our
dataset stems from a study following the SIOP protocol, patients
underwent chemotherapy before surgery and sample collection.
Approximately 25% of initial blastemal predominant tumors do not
respond to preoperative chemotherapy and have a poor prognosis.
Hence, special attention was put on identifying factors leading to an
increased resistance to chemotherapy in this blastemal subtype,
which accounts for 10% of all WTs. In the following, we refer to
those tumors as blastemal tumors.

We describe the results of our WT analysis as a learning process
that was guided by the computed enrichments, simple statistical ana—
lyses and the study of literature. For a review of the implemented en—
richment algorithms, we refer the reader to the available, extensive
literature (Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009; Efron and Tibshirani,
2007; Huang et al., 2009; Hung et al., 2011; Khatri et al., 2012;
Naeem et al., 2012).

3.1.1 Consensus of enrichment approaches

We used GeneTrail2 to examine the differences between blastemal
and non—blastemal tumors using the independent shrinkage t—test
(Opgen—Rhein and Strimmer, 2007) to compute scores for all genes
and miRNAs (see Supplementary Note S3.5). For P—value computa—
tion the gene set strategy with Benjamini—Hochberg adjustment was
chosen. In order to compare the implemented set—level statistics
based on our data, we applied all available set—level statistics exclud—
ing ORA to the score lists. The resulting enrichments are given in
Supplementary Tables S18 and S19 and under https://genetrail2.bio
inf.uni—sb.de/results.html?sessionza9e84e92—ea41—42ab—9ee7—
c0f8515f9234. We observed that, despite a considerable overlap,
the differences between the enrichments are substantial (cf.
Supplementary Fig. S1). For example, while the union of all enrich—
ments contains 1436 GO—Biological Process categories, only 343
categories are contained in their intersection. As expected, this effect
is especially pronounced for databases containing categories close to
the significance level, which may indicate that these categories were
only reported due to idiosyncrasies of the corresponding method.

circuitry of ESCs is TCF3 that together with the pluripotency factors
OCT4 (POU5F1), NANOG and SOX2 builds the set of ‘ESC master
regulators” (Cole et al., 2008). If the WNT pathway is inactive,
TCF3 is mainly repressing pluripotency factors and promoting dif—
ferentiation, however, if the WNT pathway is activated, the repres—
sive complex converts to an activating complex, promoting
pluripotency (Cole et al., 2008). To study the influence of ESC mas—
ter regulators, we constructed a new set of gene categories that we
subjected to the KS test using the blastemal versus non—blastemal
scores as input. For each of the four transcription factors (TFs), we
defined two categories containing genes for which ‘strong evidence”
exists that they are regulated by the respective TF. In particular, we
add a gene to a category for a TF if the TF occupies a site in the
gene’s promoter region and the correlation between the TF’s and the
gene’s expression is >0.5 (positive category) or smaller than —0.5
(negative category). For the identification of the promoters occupied
by the master regulators, we used the mouse ESC ChIP—Chip dataset
of Cole et al. (2008) and the ChIP—Seq data set of Marson et al.
(2008). Using this procedure, we obtained more than 1500 genes,
including many other TFs and genes involved in ESC fate, influenced
by mainly TCF3 and OCT4. For a selection, see Supplementary
Table 54. Our KS enrichment (Supplementary Table 520, https://
genetrail2.bioinf.uni—sb.de/results.html?sessi0n:cbc86903—4248—
47a2—b916—bc682924c242) revealed that genes positively regulated
by TCF3 (p z 1040) and NANOG (p z 10‘”) are strongly en—
riched, whereas genes negatively regulated by TCF3 (p z 1040) are
strongly depleted. Conversely, genes positively regulated by OCT 4
are strongly depleted, and genes negatively regulated by OCT4 are
strongly enriched. This is consistent with a correlation of TCF3 with
OCT4 of —0.7. SOX2 and NANOG both seem to be of lesser im—
portance in our data.

However, the four master regulators do not only regulate protein
coding genes. Marson et al. (2008) revealed that they are also ‘asso—
ciated with promoters for miRNAs that are preferentially expressed
in ESCs’. Examples are the miR—302, miR—515 and let—7 families
which we previously discussed (cf. Fig. 4). In addition, our data indi—
cate that TCF3 regulates the expression of the miR—17 cluster (all
correlations >0.5).

3.1.6 IGF2 as putative WNT activator

In the above section, we have outlined how the ESC regulatory cir—
cuitry is driven by TCF3 through the WNT pathway. However, the
mechanisms that activate WNT signaling still remain unclear.
Whereas certain genetic mutations occur with relatively low fre—
quency (S 30%), among them genes that may induce WNT signal—
ing, epigenetic lesions and especially loss of imprinting at the IGF2/
H19 locus have been found for 81% of all blastemal subtype WTs
(Wegert et 41., 2015) leading to an overexpression of IGF2. In 2001,
Morali et al. (2001) showed that IGF2 can induce the expression
and import of ﬁ—catenin and TCF3 into the nucleus even in the ab—
sence of WNT proteins. This triggers a switchover from the epithe—
lial to mesenchymal cell state, which is in accordance with the
expression patterns of the CM stem cell markers shown in Figure 5.
In addition, TCF3 binding sites have been found in the IGF2 gene
(Cole et al., 2008). Remarkably, we observe an extreme correlation
of 0.9 between the TCF3 and IGF2 expression (see Supplementary
Fig. 53). This suggests that TCF3 in turn regulates IGF2 leading to a
self—sustaining feedback loop which is likely to be causal for the
stem cell character of, e.g. blastemal tumors.

4 Discussion

We presented GeneTrail2, a platform for the enrichment analysis of
multi—omics datasets. GeneTrail2 was designed to offer users a max—
imal amount of flexibility while keeping the common workflow ac—
cessible to non—expert users. This is achieved by offering a user
friendly, well—documented web interface. In turn, scripting capabil—
ities allow expert users to conduct fully automated large—scale ana—
lyses and the integration into third—party applications. To further
this flexibility, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the largest
number of enrichment algorithms (Fig. 1) available in a web service.
This was motivated by the lack of gold standards for enrichment
analysis and enables researchers to choose the appropriate tool for
the task at hand. Through our comparative enrichment view, we
additionally offer a straightforward way for balancing the sensitivity
and specificity of analyses. Furthermore, we integrated an extensive
collection of biological databases allowing to choose appropriate
prior knowledge for a research task. Owing to today’s capabilities
and ubiquity of high—throughput measurement techniques, we im—
plemented support for the analysis of multi—omics datasets.
Moreover, the modular structure of GeneTrail2 ensures that new al—
gorithms, databases, organisms and identifiers can easily be added.
This allows to track the current state—of—the—art and continuously
improve GeneTrail2.

We demonstrated GeneTrail2’s capabilities by applying it to a
Wilms tumor mRNA/miRNA expression dataset. Here, the major
goal was to determine key molecular features that result in lower
susceptibility to preoperative chemotherapy of blastemal subtype
tumors. We were able to identify a substantial amount of highly sig—
nificant, cancer—associated categories that were deregulated in this
subtype. The unusual expression profiles of the let—7 miRNA family
lead to LIN28B, which is well studied in the context of WT5, and in
turn to its upstream regulator TRIM71. We discussed the role of
TRIM71 and in particular its function as a stem cell regulator and
we observed that its expression is consistent with the expression of
the CM stem cell markers EYA1, SIX2 and CITED1 (Fig. 5). These
first results indicated that stem cell regulators play a central role in
blastemal tumors. This is in agreement with the assumption that the
ability of WT cells to maintain stem cell character is a main deter—
minant for tumor malignancy. Furthermore, our results revealed an
upregulation of the canonical WNT pathway. Searching for a link
between WNT signaling and the regulatory circuitry of stem cells,
we arrived at the TF TCF3. To examine possible effects of a TCF3
deregulation, we searched for factors influenced by TCF3. We found
a large number of genes, including well—known oncogenes, with
TCF3 binding sites in their promoters and exceptionally high correl—
ations with TCF3 expression. Interestingly, IGF2 belongs to this
group of genes suggesting that TCF3 regulates IGF2. Loss of im—
printing at the H19/IGF2 locus is with an extreme rate of occurrence
of 80% the most abundant epigenetic lesion in WTs and leads to an
IGF2 overexpression that can activate the canonical WNT pathway
and, hence, trigger the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Our findings indicate that the resulting TCF3 activation closes a
self—sustaining feedback loop further boosting IGF2 production.
This offers a potential explanation on how malignant tumor cells
maintain their stem cell character. The genes discussed above clearly
separate WTs according to tumor malignancy and may hence be
promising candidates for prognostic biomarkers that may also be
valuable for therapy stratification.

The presented use case shows that GeneTrail2 is able to uncover
biologically informative signals in —omics data making it an import—
ant tool for the elucidation of pathogenic processes. The ability to

compare multiple enrichment results from the same or different
—0mics allows to identify differences and similarities between experi—
ments. These capabilities are central for modern in silico analyses
and set GeneTrail2 apart from other approaches.

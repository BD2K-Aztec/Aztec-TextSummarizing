Abstract

Summary: Combinatorial assembly of DNA elements is an efficient method for building large—scale
synthetic pathways from standardized, reusable components. These methods are particularly useful
because they enable assembly of multiple DNA fragments in one reaction, at the cost of requiring
that each fragment satisfies design constraints. We developed BIOPARTSBUILDER as a biologist—friendly
web tool to design biological parts that are compatible with DNA combinatorial assembly methods,
such as Golden Gate and related methods. It retrieves biological sequences, enforces compliance
with assembly design standards and provides a fabrication plan for each fragment.

Availability and implementation: BIOPARTSBUILDER is accessible at http://public.bi0partsbuiIder.0rg
and an Amazon Web Services image is available from the AWS Market Place (AMI ID: ami—
508acf38). Source code is released under the MIT license, and available for download at https://

1 Introduction

DNA synthesis technologies are improving faster than Moore’s law,
allowing the synthesis of genes, pathways (R0 et (11., 2006), bacterial
genomes (Gibson et (11., 2010), eukaryotic chromosomes (Annaluru
et (11., 2014; Dymond et (11., 2011) and eventually entire eukaryotic
genomes. Many projects have individual ‘parts’ as synthetic targets,
such as promoters, coding domains and transcriptional terminators.
While individual parts can be characterized, predicting how parts
will operate together remains a challenge. Rather than building a
single construct, therefore, it can be more efficient to specify mul-
tiple alternatives for each part, then use massively parallel synthesis
and assembly to generate a combinatorial library that can be
screened for the desired function. In particular, Golden Gate assem-
bly is an efficient and effective strategy to assemble combinatorial
libraries (Engler et (11., 2009). However, Golden Gate assembly

requires a computationally challenging design step to create ‘stand-
ardized’ parts that have compatible overhangs, lack pre-defined re-
striction sites and comply with other constraints.

To streamline the process of designing standardized biological
parts for Golden Gate assembly, we developed BIOPARISBUILDER,
which retrieves sequence data from different sources and ensures
compliance with design standards that are compatible with com-
binatorial assembly. Though there are tools for automated parts re-
trieval (Scher et (11., 2014) and subsequent primer design for DNA
assembly (Bode et (11., 2009; Rouillard et (11., 2004), the choices for
Golden Gate assembly are limited. Compared with existing Golden
Gate designers (Hillson et (11., 2012), BIOPARISBUILDER is distributed
open source software and freely modified by both academic and
commercial users. BIOPARISBUILDER also provides a repository system
that stores the designed parts and shares data within members

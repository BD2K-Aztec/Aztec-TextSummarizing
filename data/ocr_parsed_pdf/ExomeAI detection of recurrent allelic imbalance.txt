frequency) in the control database will be used to ﬁnd the recurrent AI.
The output of this ﬁnal step will be a list of identiﬁed segments with
names and number of tumor samples that share the segment
(Supplementary Table S2) along with the plots of the segments for
each chromosome (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7).

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND EXAMPLES

The development of ExomeAI method has been motivated by
the need to detect the recurrent AI using WES dataset of tumor—
only SCCOHT samples. By applying this method, we showed
that 19p were deleted in all patients with SMARCA4 mutations
(Witkowski et al., 2014). Since then, we have successfully
applied our method to several other cancer types such as
glioma, renal cell carcinoma (unpublished data) and ETMR
(Kleinman et al., 2014) (see Supplementary information) and
showed that the approach is sensitive to clearly detect the recur—
rent AI across cancer genomes, in the absence of paired normal
samples.

As we believe that the approach has a wide application in
cancer genome research and in order to make it publically avail—
able to non—computational cancer researchers, we developed a
web—based application facilitated by Galaxy platform (Goecks
et al., 2010) which is platform for biomedical genomic research.
ExomeAI server is equipped with two 3.4—GHz Intel processors
(a total of 8 cores/ 16 threads), 32 GB of RAM, and 10 TB of disc
space, and is accessible through http://genomequebec.mcgill.ca/
exomeai.

4 EVALUATION USING SIMULATED DATA

In order to evaluate the accuracy of the method, we created a
simulated dataset using 10 real non—cancer Exomes (not included
in the control database) and we added over 600 CNAs on 22
autosomal chromosomes (hgl9). Ranging in length, size and
copy number, CNVs were randomly located on genome.
Simulated aberrations included all combinations of: length
(Mb) = [1,3,5,10,15,20], copy number= [1,3] and non—aber—
rant/normal DNA fraction (%) = [5,10,20,30,40,50].

We analyzed the simulated dataset using ExomeAI and four
other softwares: SomatiCA, ExomeCNV (LOH analysis),
XHMM and CoNIFER. For the methods that required matched
normal samples (ExomeCNV and SomatiCA), samples before
adding simulated CNAs were used as matched normal samples.
For all softwares, default parameters were used (see supplemen—
tary information for details).

Sensitivity was calculated as the overlap of identiﬁed CNAs
with true simulated ones divided by the total length of simulated
CNAs. Specificity was calculated as TN/(TN + FP), where TN is
the length of True Negative and FF is the length of False Positive
regions at single base resolution.

Supplementary Figure S8 shows the sensitivity and specificity
of all ﬁve softwares averaged over all Exomes (n = 10). The
Circos plot (Supplementary Fig. S9) depicts the results for all
methods across the genome of one simulated Exome. As
shown in Supplementary Table S3, ExomeAI achieved a
sensitivity of 0.76 with speciﬁcity >0.99. Using matched
normal samples, SomatiCA could achieve a higher sensitivity
(0.82); however, its speciﬁcity was lower (0.97).

In general, the softwares that were primarily developed for
CNA detection in cancer (ExomeAI, ExomeCNV and
SomatiCA) showed higher power to detect CNA. It was at
least partially because ExomeCNV and SomatiCA used matched
normal samples and ExomeAI used the internal control
database. CoNIFER and XHMM had very similar results. The
sensitivities of the two software were low in the simulated
dataset, which is consistent with previous studies (Tan et al.,
2014); however, they may perform better when CNVs are more
homogeneous and are present only in a low proportion of
samples.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We present a novel web application for detection of recurrent
LOH or, more generally, AI events across batches of tumor—only
WES datasets. We show that ExomeAI can be effectively applied
in various cancer types. Using a control database of non—cancer
samples, ExomeAI overcomes the limitation of the ‘obligatory’
usage of matched normal samples and efﬁciently reduces the
rate of false positive calls. Working on multiple samples and
looking for recurrent events further reduce the chance of
false positives. In case where some of the samples have
matched—normal counterparts, the recurrent aberrations can be
further studied in those samples using other softwares which
have been well reviewed elsewhere (Liu et al., 2013; Alkodsi
et al., 2014).

ABSTRACT

Summary: Here we introduce ccSOL omics, a webserver for large-
scale calculations of protein solubility. Our method allows (i) prote-
ome-wide predictions; (ii) identification of soluble fragments within
each sequences; (iii) exhaustive single-point mutation analysis.
Results: Using coil/disorder, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, ,B-sheet
and a-helix propensities, we built a predictor of protein solubility.
Our approach shows an accuracy of 79% on the training set (36 990
Target Track entries). Validation on three independent sets indicates
that ccSOL omics discriminates soluble and insoluble proteins with an
accuracy of 74% on 31 760 proteins sharing <30% sequence
similarity.

1 INTRODUCTION

Algorithms for prediction of protein solubility (Wilkinson and
Harrison, 1991) and aggregation (FernandeziEscamilla et al.,
2004) provide a solid basis to investigate physico-chemical deter-
minants of amyloid ﬁbril formation and associated diseases
(ConchillmSolé et al., 2007; Tartaglia et al., 2004). In the past
years, an in vitro reconstituted translation system allowed the
large-scale investigation of Escherichia coli proteins solubility
(Niwa et al., 2009), thus providing the opportunity for the devel-
opment of predictive methods such as ccSOL (Agostini et al.,
2012). In ccSOL, coil/disorder, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity,
ﬂ-sheet and a-helical propensities are combined together into a
solubility propensity score that is useful to investigate protein
expression (Baig et al., 2014) as well as bacterial evolution
(W arnecke, 2012). Other methods have been developed to predict
protein solubility based on amino acid characteristics. For in-
stance, PROSO II (Smialowski et al., 2012) exploits occurrence
of monopeptides and dipeptides to estimate heterologous

expression in E.coli. PROSO II was trained on the pepcDB data-
base [now Target Track (Berman et al., 2009)] that stores target
and protocol information provided by Protein Structure
Initiative centers. Both ccSOL and PROSO II perform accurate
predictions when used to respectively predict endogenous or
heterologous soluble expressions [ccSOL: 76% accuracy;
PROSO II: 75% accuracy (Smialowski et al., 2012)]. We found
that the experimental status of several Target Track entries
(http://sbkb.org/tt/) has been recently updated and new data
are available to train predictive methods (see Supplementary
Material). Here, we introduce a novel implementation of the
ccSOL method, called ccSOL omics, to perform large-scale pre-
dictions of endogenous and heterologous expression in E.coli.
Our algorithm has been trained on non-redundant Target
Track entries to identify soluble and insoluble regions within
protein sequences. We envisage that ccSOL omics will be useful
for protein engineering studies, as it allows the investigation of
sequence variants in large datasets.

2 WORKFLOW AND IMPLEMENTATION

The ccSOL omics server allows the investigation of large protein
datasets (see Supplementary Material). Once the user provides
sequences in FASTA format, the algorithm calculates:

o Solubility proﬁles. To identify soluble fragments within each
polypeptide chain, protein sequences are divided into elem-
ents and individual solubility propensities are calculated.
Starting from the N—terminus of a protein, we use a sliding
window of 21 amino acids that is moved one residue at a
time until the C-terminus is reached. The solubility propen-
sity proﬁle of each fragment is calculated as defined in our
previous publication (Agostini et al., 2012).

0 Sequence susceptibility. For each sequence analyzed, the al-
gorithm computes the effect of single amino acid mutations
at different positions. This approach is particularly useful to
identify regions susceptible to solubility change upon muta-
tion. All variants are reported along with their scores, which
provides a basis to engineer protein sequences and test
hypotheses such as the occurrence of speciﬁc mutations in
pathology.

0 Solubility score. The solubility proﬁle represents a unique
signature containing information on all fragments arranged
in sequential order. In our approach, the proﬁle is used to

estimate solubility upon expression in the E.coli system. As
sequences have different lengths, we exploit a method based
on Fourier’s transform (Bellucci et al., 2011; Tartaglia et al.,
2007) that allows comparison of polypeptide chains with
different sizes. Using 100 Fourier’s coefficients, we trained
an algorithm that has the same architecture developed for
the analysis of protein expression levels in E.coli [i.e. neural
network approach (Tartaglia et al., 2009)].

0 Reliability score. The webserver provides a conﬁdence score
based on statistical analysis of both training and testing sets
(i.e. sequence range used to validate the method; see
Supplementary Material).

All the aforementioned analyses are performed for each sub-
mitted protein set if the number of entries is <500. Because of
the intense CPU usage, sequence susceptibility scores are not
computed for datasets >500 entries.

3 PERFORMANCES

Expression of human prion (PrP) in E.coli is particularly difﬁ-
cult, as the protein accumulates in inactive aggregates (Baneyx
and Mujacic, 2004). ccSOL omics correctly predicts that PrP is
insoluble and identiﬁes the fragment 13(Ll70 as the least soluble
(Fig. lAiC) together with region 2317253 (not present in the
mature form). This ﬁnding is very well in agreement with what
has been previously reported in literature (Tartaglia et al., 2005,
2008). Moreover, the analysis of susceptible fragments identiﬁes
a number of experimentally validated mutations (e.g. G131V,
S132I, R148H, V1761 and D178N) associated with lower solu-
bility and located in the region promoting PrP aggregation
(Corsaro et al., 2012) [see Supplementary Material]. As for the
large-scale performances of ccSOL omics, we used a 10-fold

cross-validation on Target Track [total of 36 990 entries with
30% redundancy (Fu et al., 2012)] and observed 79% accuracy
in discriminating between soluble and insoluble proteins.
Furthermore, we tested the algorithm on three independent data-
sets containing protein expression data [total of 31760 entries
taken from E.coli (Niwa et al., 2009), SOLpro (Magnan et al.,
2009) and PROSO II (Smialowski et al., 2012)] and found 74%
accuracy (Fig. 1D; see also Supplementary Material).

4 CONCLUSIONS

The ccSOL omics algorithm shows excellent performances in
predicting solubility of endogenous and heterologous genes in
E.coli. We hope that the webserver will be useful for biotechno-
logical purposes, as it could be for instance used to design fusion
tags for soluble expression. Although accurate, our calculations
are based on sequence features, and integration with structural
characteristics will dramatically increase the predictive power.
We plan to combine ccSOL omics with information on chaper-
one (Tartaglia et al., 2010) and RNA (Bellucci et al., 2011; Choi
et al., 2009) interactions, as these molecules greatly contribute
to the solubility of protein products (Cirillo et al., 2014; Zanzoni
et al., 2013).

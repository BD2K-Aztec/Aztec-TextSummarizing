substitutions as well as the frequency of variation. If DNA—Seq
data are also available, the same information, except for the
strand, is provided to assess genomic sequence and, thus, exclude
potential SNPs. In addition, individual positions can be ﬁltered
according to read coverage, base quality score, mapping quality,
bases supporting the variation, type of substitution and frequency.
REDItooanaRna.py can exclude positions in homopolymeric re—
gions of predeﬁned length, in intronic sequences surrounding
known splice sites, invariant RNA—Seq positions, sites not sup—
ported by DNA—Seq and positions near read ends. Additionally,
users can provide genomic regions to include or exclude in RNA
editing searches. Additional read level ﬁlters include the possibility
of excluding ambiguously mapped reads, possible PCR duplicates
and discordant paired—end reads. In the case of directional RNA—
Seq data, REDItooanaRna.py can infer the strand per position,
improving the reliability of RNA editing calls by excluding noise
from antisense transcription or mapping errors. Alternatively, the
strand of individual positions can be inferred from user speciﬁed
annotations.

REDItoolKnown.py, has been developed to explore the RNA
editing potential of RNA—Seq experiments by looking at known
events only, following an improved methodology implemented in
our ExpEdit web service (Picardi et al., 2011) (see Supplementary
Material for details).

Finally, REDItoolDenovo.py performs the de novo detection of
RNA editing candidates using RNA—Seq data alone without
resequencing data for the individual donor genome (Picardi
et al., 2012) (see Supplementary Material for details).

REDItools includes some accessory scripts to post—process
output tables, filtering candidates position—by—position using
known annotations and identifying ambiguous alignments by
Blat. All candidate positions can also be easily and quickly anno—
tated using relevant databases as those in the UCSC genome
browser.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

REDItools are in the portable python programming language
and based on the Pysam module, a wrapper for the widely
used SAMtools (Li et al., 2009), which includes methods and
functions to handle read alignments in SAM/BAM formati
facilitating the browsing of multiple read alignments site by site
along a reference genome. All scripts have low memory request
enabling RNA editing calling on standard desktop computers.
Because the search for RNA editing candidates is time—consum—
ing requiring the processing of individual genomic positions,
REDItools can speed up the process by distributing calculations
over independent cores using the native python multiprocessing
module. Filtering and annotation of individual positions is
extremely fast and memory efﬁcient, as it is performed by the
tabix program (Li et al., 2009) wrapped in the Pysam module.

REDItools require inputs in BAM format from any platform/
organism, and results are provided in tab—forrnatted tables
facilitating downstream analyses.

We tested REDItools on the lymphoblastoid cell line
GM12878 used in Ramaswami et a]. (2012) for which BAM
ﬁles produced by the BWA mapper (Li and Durbin, 2009) were
kindly provided by the authors. Limiting the analysis to chr21
and using the same ﬁltering scheme as the original work, we

obtained remarkably similar results (see Supplementary
Material for details). Remapping all reads by GSNAP (Wu and
Nacu, 2011) to preserve the paired end information and reapply—
ing REDItools, we obtained 221401 and 2089 candidate editing
sites in Alu regions and non—Alu non repetitive regions, respect—
ively, with respect to 147029 and 1451 sites detected by
Ramaswami et a]. (2012) (see Supplementary Material for
details).

In conclusion, REDItools is a unique and effective resource
for the investigation of RNA editing from NGS data. It is highly
ﬂexible, including a variety of ﬁlters and quality checks, and may
provide very reliable sets of editing candidate sites according to
the user requirements (see Supplementary Material for a further
benchmark application on Illumina Body Map RNA—Seq data).

ABSTRACT

Summary: Numerous software applications exist to deal with syn-
thetic gene design, granting the field of heterologous expression a
significant support. However, their dispersion requires the access to
different tools and online services in order to complete one single
project. Analyzing codon usage, calculating codon adaptation index
(CAI), aligning orthologs and optimizing genes are just a few examples.
A software application, EuGene, was developed for the optimization of
multiple gene synthetic design algorithms. In a seamless automatic
form, EuGene calculates or retrieves genome data on codon usage
(relative synonymous codon usage and CAI), codon context (CPS and
codon pair bias), GC content, hidden stop codons, repetitions, dele-
terious sites, protein primary, secondary and tertiary structures, gene
orthologs, species housekeeping genes, performs alignments and
identifies genes and genomes. The main function of EuGene is analyz-
ing and redesigning gene sequences using multi-objective optimiza-
tion techniques that maximize the coding features of the resulting
sequence.

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular biology has witnessed an increased use of computer sci-
ence tools, especially after the ﬁrst genome sequencing projects.
Assessing the effect and meaning of the genetic information for
cells, discovering the information underlying genes and describing
protein functionality are some of the most important tasks in this
field. Often these require specialized computing tools.

Moreover, the developments in the field of gene decoding and
protein synthesis already show a good knowledge of the factors
that are involved in it. Those factors are mostly related to codon
usage (Angov et al., 2008), codon context (Moura et al., 2007), GC
content, hidden stop-codons (Seligmann and Pollock, 2004), repeti-
tions (Bregeon et al., 2001), deleterious sequences (Jin et al., 2006),
messenger RNA (mRNA) secondary structure (Kozak, 1986) and
charged transfer RNA availability (W elch et al., 2009). Controlling
such factors has become imperative in the field of synthetic gene
design. Therefore, numerous tools have been developed to optimize
gene sequences and modulate specific characteristics that are believed

to inﬂuence protein expression efficiency, such as Optimizer (Puigbo
et al., 2007), Synthetic Gene Designer (Wu et al., 2006) and Gene
Composer (Lorimer et al., 2009).

Most of them offer several forms of codon usage optimization,
restriction sites management and removal of codon and nucleotide
repetitions. However, selection or input of additional information is
usually required, such as codon usage and context tables or ortho-
logs to perform alignments. Nonetheless, most of the required infor-
mation is available online in diverse biological databases such as
NCBI, EBI, PDB and KEGG, but few systems take advantage of
those.

Several other tasks are involved in synthetic gene design efficiency,
such as calculating protein secondary structure and Visualizing the
tertiary structure to aid in mapping protein motifs to gene zones or
gathering and aligning orthologs to ﬁnd similarities and conservation
regions. Nevertheless, despite the amount and variety of available
gene information and synthetic redesign approaches, integration of
those factors into a single optimization tool is still very limited. Thus,
in order to advance and facilitate synthetic gene design and analysis,
we developed a tool that integrates several online services, ofﬂine
tools and synthetic gene redesign techniques into a single application.

2 FEATURES

EuGene capabilities can be separated into two blocks, data gathering
and gene optimization. In the first block, a set of features allows the
retrieval of information about a gene from several known online
sources, ofﬂine tools and statistical calculations on its own
genome. In the second block, EuGene allows redesigning a gene
according to several factors that inﬂuence the mRNA decoding pro-
cess, using information obtained in the data gathering procedure.

2.1 Data gathering

A large amount of information about genes and genomes can be
considered for synthetic design. For instance, it is common to evalu-
ate the protein’s secondary and tertiary structures and try to map
how the gene’s codon sequence inﬂuences the formation of these
structures. Unraveling which codons are responsible for the correct
folding of a polypeptide might be essential when redesigning genes,
in order to ensure the solubility of the final protein. Another clue to
identifying important regions of a gene is given by its level of con-
servation among orthologs. Other forms of information are also
important, such as having a set of highly expressed genes in order
to calculate codon adaptation index (CAI) values.

Before retrieving related information, EuGene identifies genes
using two strategies. The first is processing gene annotations that

are normally present in FASTA and GenBank formats, extracting
any database identifiers. Those identiﬁers are then used to access
NCBI and obtain the names of the gene and genome and resulting
protein. The second strategy uses the gene codon sequence to per-
form an online BLAST in NCBI (Johnson et al, 2008). If an iden-
tical gene is found, the same information is retrieved (gene, protein
and genome names), plus a set of orthologs resulting from BLAST.

Further information regarding the gene is then obtained by con-
tacting PDB and KEGG online servers to automatically download
more orthologs, protein tertiary structures and highly expressed
genes for the same genome. Orthologs are seamlessly aligned with
the gene using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004), and colored according to
codon conservation, allowing a Visible assessment of conserved and
functional regions. The protein 3D structure is then presented, and is
Visually mapped to the codon sequence, easing the understanding of
which codons decode to which regions of the protein. The highly
expressed genes obtained permit the automatic calculation of CAI
for any gene in the same genome. Moreover, the protein secondary
structure is also seamlessly calculated and presented using PsiPred
(McGufﬁn et al, 2000). Other calculations to enable assessment of
relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and codon pair bias (CPB
for codon context) are automatic upon opening a genome ﬁle.

All retrieved and calculated information are always displayed.
That includes, for each gene, its CAI, G+C%, NC effective
codons, mean RSCU, CPB, protein primary, secondary and tertiary
structures, orthologs and corresponding names (Fig. 1).

2.2 Synthetic gene redesign

The main functionality of EuGene is optimizing gene codon se-
quences according to specific aspects. A set of six redesign
approaches is available to customize the gene: codon usage (RSCU
and CAI); codon context (CPB); G+C content level; controlling
hidden stop codons; the elimination of repetitions and removal of
deleterious sites (such as ShineeDalgarno). All modiﬁcations are per-
formed without changing the resulting native amino acid sequence.
Moreover, changes are controlled by the genetic code and codon
usage/context tables of the target host species and, therefore, if the
host species is non-native, the protein primary structure is always
maintained and all redesign considerations are made using the stat-
istical information of the host. This allows, for instance, harmonizing
the codons usage of a gene to express in a heterologous host. The

and aligned orthologs are shown. On the right, information about the
selected gene is shown, such as the protein tertiary structure

target host species can be any whose genome data (FASTA or
GenBank file) was uploaded into the application.

EuGene allows simultaneous optimization of any redesign
approaches by using two multi-objective optimization techniques: a
genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. Both strategies aim at
finding the overall best gene candidate for the redesign parameters.
However, simulated annealing is much quicker in the search for the
optimal codon conﬁguration, and is, therefore, ideal for experiments
that need fast results. However, in the gene multi-goal design, there is
rarely one single optimal solution due to the degeneracy of the gen-
etic code. Thus, using a genetic algorithm in combination with a
Pareto front archive (Knowles and Come, 2000), it is possible to
return a list of the best equivalent solutions to the optimization re-
quirements, allowing selection of a solution offering the best
trade-off between the selected redesign methods.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

EuGene is built in Java, using web-start technology, which enables
automatic updates in order to ensure the application has the latest
features and corrections. Moreover, EuGene has a modular archi-
tecture where each gene redesign procedure is independent, allowing
the facilitated construction of new features. This is especially suitable
to the biological ﬁeld, given its constant evolution.

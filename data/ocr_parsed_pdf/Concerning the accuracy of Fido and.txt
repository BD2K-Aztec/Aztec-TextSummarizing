A recent article by Huang and He (2012) illustrates a method for
applying linear programming to protein inference and compares
this method to a handful of established methods for protein in-
ference: ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003), MSBayes (Li
et al., 2008) and Fido (Serang et al., 2010). Unfortunately,
Huang and He (2012) gives the impression that protein probabil-
ities computed by Fido are erratic, yielding either markedly su-
perior performance (e.g. in the Sigma 49 dataset) or inferior
performance (e.g. in the HumanMD dataset) compared with
the rest of the field; however, this erratic performance is simply
the effect of not choosing the parameters by grid search as spe-
ciﬁed in Serang et a]. (2010). Performing a rough grid search
(a e {0.01, 0.04, 0.09, 0.16, 0.25, 0.36}, )3 e {0.0, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05}
and y e {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}) tojointly optimize discrimination
and calibration substantially improves the quality of the prob-
abilities computed (Fig. l) and makes Fido competitive with
ProteinProphet. Performing the grid search takes 4.42s on a
Core i3 laptop.

Not only are Fido’s three parameters important for weighing
many pieces of low-scoring peptide evidence against fewer pieces
of high-scoring peptide evidence, but they also substantially
determine the treatment of shared (i.e. ‘degenerate’) peptides.
As a result, the optimal values for these parameters are inﬂu-
enced by many factors (e. g. the coverage of the experiment, the
complexity of the sample and so forth), and these parameters are,
understandably, dataset-specific; although using blind parameter
estimates may give reasonable performance in some situations
(particularly when the parameters come from a dataset with
similar characteristics), Fido is not intended to be run without
these parameters intelligently set (Via the grid search noted earlier
in the text or manually).

To be fair, there are situations where the means to estimate
free parameters (i.e. true- and false-positive labels) are not avail-
able, and in these cases, it is not unreasonable to try parameters
estimated from another similar data set; however, even in this
case, the parameters in Fido are not intended to be chosen arbi-
trarily without regard for their performance. If no labels are
available, manual parameter choice is an option (e.g. choosing
parameters that rank a known highly abundant protein over
others). In the rare case when no information for validation is

Fig. 1. The accuracy of Fido with poor and well-chosen parameters.
Fido’s performance on an example dataset (HumanMD) from Huang
and He (2012) is signiﬁcantly better when choosing parameters as speci-
ﬁed in and Serang et a]. (2010). ProteinProphet, a well-known method for
protein inference, is shown for comparison

available, Fido, like all models with free parameters, should not
be used.

To better enable researchers to use Fido in the way intended
and to aid in future comparisons, we have released an updated
executable, which automatically performs the grid search as
described in Serang et a]. (2010) (without need of the previous
shell script wrapper). It is available for free download from

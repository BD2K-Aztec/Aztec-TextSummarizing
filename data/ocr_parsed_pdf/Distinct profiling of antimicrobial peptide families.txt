Abstract

Motivation: The increased prevalence of multi—drug resistant (MDR) pathogens heightens the need
to design new antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit broad—spectrum potent
activity against MDR pathogens and kills rapidly, thus giving rise to AMPs being recognized as a
potential substitute for conventional antibiotics. Designing new AMPs using current in-silico
approaches is, however, challenging due to the absence of suitable models, large number of de—
sign parameters, testing cycles, production time and cost. To date, AMPs have merely been catego—
rized into families according to their primary sequences, structures and functions. The ability to
computationally determine the properties that discriminate AMP families from each other could
help in exploring the key characteristics of these families and facilitate the in-silico design of syn—
thetic AMPs.

Results: Here we studied 14 AMP families and sub—families. We selected a specific description of
AMP amino acid sequence and identified compositional and physicochemical properties of amino
acids that accurately distinguish each AMP family from all other AMPs with an average sensitivity,
specificity and precision of 92.88%, 99.86% and 95.96%, respectively. Many of our identified dis—
criminative properties have been shown to be compositional or functional characteristics of the
corresponding AMP family in literature. We suggest that these properties could serve as guides for
in-silico methods in design of novel synthetic AMPs. The methodology we developed is generic
and has a potential to be applied for characterization of any protein family.

Escalating deaths due to increased exposure of living organisms to
infectious diseases and the rapid evolution of multi—drug resistant
(MDR) microbes spurred interest in alternative remedies that can
treat the MDR microbes causing these diseases (Saxena and
Gomber, 2010). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been pin—
pointed as one such remedy (Gordon et (11., 2005; Hancock and
Diamond, 2000; Sundararajan et (11., 2012), owing to their broad—
spectrum potent activity against Gram—positive and Gram—negative
bacteria, fungi, protozoa, parasites, cancer cells and different kinds

spectrum of microbes and their ability to kill rapidly have rendered
them highly effective substitute for conventional antibiotics
(Hancock and Lehrer, 1998; Brahmachary et (11., 2004; Hancock
and Sahl, 2006; Peters et (11., 2010; Thomas et (11., 2010). Moreover,
designed AMPs have been reported to kill MDR microbes (Yeaman
and Yount, 2003). AMPs interact with target microbes by mem—
brane permeation and penetration (Andreu and Rivas, 1998;
Brogden, 2005; Radek and Gallo, 2007), subsequently affecting

cytoplasmic membrane septum formation (additional complemen—
tary mechanisms involve disruption of cell wall, nucleic acids and
proteins biosynthesis processes), thereby ultimately killing the tar—
geted microbe (Frecer et (11., 2004; Peters et (11., 2010; Chen et (11.,
2012; Fjell et (11., 2012). Differences in the membrane structure of
higher eukaryotes and microbes cause the later to be easily recog—
nized and targeted (Thomas et (11., 2010).

AMPs are typically short molecules of less than 100 amino acids
(Jenssen et (11., 2006; Sang and Blecha, 2008; Peters et (11., 2010;
Pasupuleti et (11., 2012), most of which are cationic and amphipathic
(Epand and Vogel, 1999; Lehrer and Ganz, 1999). They exist in all
classes of life and are evolutionarily conserved (Yeaman and Yount,
2003; Hancock and Sahl, 2006). Thus, AMPs have been classified
into families and sub—families based on their primary sequences and
structures (Kaiser and Diamond, 2000; Yeaman and Yount, 2003).
However, there is substantial experimental evidence that even minor
variations in peptide structures can lead to significant differences in
AMP activities (Ganz, 2003; Thomas et (11., 2010).

Hundreds of natural AMPs have been identified and characterized,
with information in public databases, e.g. DAMPD (Sundararajan
et (11., 2012), CAMP (Thomas et (11., 2010; Waghu et (11., 2014), APD2
(Wang et (11., 2009), APD (Wang and Wang, 2004) and ANTIMIC
(Brahmachary et (11., 2004). However, increased demand for AMPs fos—
tered more interest in in-vitro design of AMPs (Nusslein et (11., 2006;
Marcos et (11., 2008). The design of novel synthetic AMPs is challenging
due to the wide variety of properties that characterize them (Guralp
et (11., 2013). Thus, developing computational models that identify these
essential properties and pinpoint candidate AMPs have gained interest
(Fjell et (11., 2012; Maccari et (11., 2013). An effective and efficient in-sil—
ico approach is needed to identify candidate properties that may guide
the design of new AMPs (Juretic et (11., 201 1).

A number of methods have been proposed to identify and char—
acterize AMPs using compositional characteristics of their amino
acid sequences and information extracted from sequence alignment
(Lata et (11., 2007, 2010; Wang et (11., 2011). However, the activities
and interaction mechanisms of AMPs cannot be fully characterized
exclusively using their amino acid composition. Rather, their struc—
tural and physicochemical properties could help in better under—
standing the determinants underlying these activities (Fjell et (11.,
2012). Efforts have been made to study physicochemical properties
of AMPs (Langham et (11., 2008; Porto et (11., 2010; Torrent et (11.,
2011; Maccari et (11., 2013). However, a comprehensive and system—
atic analysis of these properties, their colocation within different
AMP regions and characterization of different AMP families by
them to the best of our knowledge are not yet available.

In this study, we developed a novel computational model to rep—
resent AMP sequences and a method to identify physicochemical
and compositional properties of AMPs that are capable to distin—
guish different AMP families from each other. The methodology we
developed to represent AMP families and identify their properties is
generic, with a potential to be used in characterizing arbitrary pro—
tein family. The differences we identified in characterizing various
AMP families by these features are so pronounced that, in a ma—
chine—learning framework, they enable for most of the AMP families
100% specificity in separation of peptides of an AMP family from
other AMPs, providing sensitivity that ranges from approximately
62% to 100%. Many of our identified discriminative properties
have been shown to be compositional or functional characteristics
of the corresponding AMP family in literature. These results suggest
that the identified AMP properties make them potential design
guides for development of synthetic AMPs with characteristics of
specific families.

2 Methods

2.1 Datasets

Sequences of all 753 non—redundant natural mature peptides known
to belong to specific AMP families and sub—families (in our case 128
families/sub—families) were obtained from the DAMPD database
(Sundararajan et (11., 2012). All AMPs in DAMPD database were
manually curated and experimentally validated to possess antimicro—
bial activity. The AMPs in the database were classified into families/
sub—families according to their annotation provided by UniProt
(2014). We examined the AMP families/sub—families that contain
more than 10 peptides that we denote as ‘target AMP families’.
Consequently, we studied 14 target AMP families that all together
have 465 peptides. The 288 peptides that belong to the remaining
114 families/sub—families of AMPs were used as a part of the ‘nega—
tive dataset’. The negative dataset is specific for each target AMP
family and contains the 288 peptides mentioned above, as well as all
peptides from the remaining 13 target AMP families (excluding pep—
tides from the target AMP family). Such negative datasets are used
during the identification of properties that characterize each of the
14 target AMP families. That is, the peptides of a particular target
AMP family are contrasted to all other AMP peptides in the negative
dataset (Supplementary Table S1) shows the distribution of the pep—
tides among the obtained families/sub—families. Comparison of the
amino acid composition of the selected families/sub—families is pro—
vided in Supplementary Materials S7. In order to compare AMP ver—
sus non—AMPs, we also compiled as set of non—AMPs as follows:

1. We used from Uniprot all protein sequences of length 10—212
(same length distribution as the AMP sequences) whose ontology
annotation does not contain any keyword related to antimicro—
bial activity (e.g. Antimicrobial, Antibacterial, Antifungal,
Fungicide, Defensin, Antiviral, etc.). This provided 18 082 non—
AMP sequences.

2. Then, to reduce redundancy among these sequences, three clus—
tering steps using the h—cd—hit (Li and Godzik, 2006) program
were made at three identity thresholds (290%, 260% and
230%). The purpose of this was to remove identical sequences
and obtain a non—redundant dataset of non—AMP sequences. As
a result, we obtained 7066 non—AMP sequences.

3. Finally, we retained those sequences that were composed only of
uniquely deﬁned canonical 20 amino acids (excluding all those
with nonstandard letters B, Z, J, X, U and O). This produced
6740 non—AMP sequences.

2.2 Models of peptide/protein sequences

The methodology we developed to represent different peptides/pro—
teins can be summarized as follows. Our method complements an
earlier introduced method to computationally model in the same
manner proteins of different lengths and families for analysis of their
cellular localization (Matsuda et (11., 2005). This model by Matsuda
et al. enabled that every protein sequence, irrespective of its length
and family, is described in the same manner enabling their computa—
tional comparison and equal treatment. Under this model, different
proteins will have different parameters of the model derived from
compositional properties of different protein regions. Our extension
of this model was in adding to such protein description a part with
physicochemical characteristics in a way that is not dependent on
the protein/peptide length (as this aspect has already been resolved
by the Matsuda et al. model). Essentially, each of the regions defined
by the Matsuda et al. model we associated with the restrictive physi—
cochemical properties of that region and the GA optimization we

applied selected the features from that set. Consequently, the model—
ing methodology we developed as explained above caters for pro—
tein/peptides of different length and their variable characteristics.

We explain this methodology as in the following. AMP se—
quences are divided into three regions. This is motivated by the fact
that N and C terminals of the peptide sequences are enriched with
properties that discriminate peptide families from each other (Hayes
et (11., 2006; Lata et (11., 2010; Minervini et (11., 2003). Then, each
peptide is encoded by a feature vector composed of two parts. The
first part consists of features that represent mainly the peptide amino
acid composition. The second part involves the representation of the
restrictive physicochemical properties (those that show high invari—
ance values within peptides of the same family) within the predeter—
mined regions in the peptide sequence. These two parts of the
feature vector are explained in what follows.

2.2.1 Basic representation of peptide features

We represent peptides from all families using the same number of
features. We followed the protein representation method proposed
in Matsuda et al. (2005 ). In this representation, the peptide sequence
is divided into three regions, N—terminal (N), middle region (M) and
C—terminal (C). The N—terminal is further divided into four sub—
regions: n1, n2, n3 and n4. The size of each region is determined
depending on the sequence length L. That is, long sequences will
have longer N and C termini, whereas short sequences will have
shorter termini. For the reason that AMP peptides are of shorter
length when compared with most other proteins and because pep—
tides among AMP families differ between each other in the length of
their sequences, we tested the performance of the developed model
using different values of dN (length of one of the four sub—regions
within the N—terminal) and dc (length of C—terminal) parameters for
each family. We selected the dN and dc values (Table 1 and
Supplementary Materials S2.3) that we found through experimenta—
tion to be the most suitable for our intended analysis. Then, the se—
quence of a peptide is represented by a 184—feature vector as
follows: 140 features represent the composition of amino acids in all

the regions n1, n2, n3, n4, M, C and the entire sequence (20 features
in 7 regions); 20 features for the composition of twin amino acids
(two successive same amino acids, e.g. AA, LL) in the M—region; 6
features for the distance frequencies of basic amino acids (R, K and
H) in each of N and M regions giving in total 12 features; another 6
features for the distance frequencies of hydrophobic amino acids (I,
V, L, F, M, A, G, W and P) in the M—region and the last 6 features
for the distance frequencies of other amino acids (D, N, E, Q, Y, S,
T and C) in the M—region. The six—values of distance frequencies are
calculated as follows. The distance (H) between two successive
amino acids in the specified class is assigned to one of six distance
categories (H21, 1 <HS6, 6<H§ 11, 11 <H§ 16, 16<H§21,
H > 21). Then, the number of occurrences of the distances in these
categories represents the distance frequencies. For example, the dis—
tances between basic amino acids (R, K and H) in the sequence
(ARMRAASKAALLMAENAK) are 2, 4, 7, 1 and 3. The six fre—
quency values of these distance values are (1, 3, 1, 0, 0 and 0). The
motivation behind this representation (Matsuda et (11., 2005) is that
dividing the peptide sequence into regions gives more ﬂexibility to
capture the peptide signal sequences, and such signals might be dis—
tributed across different regions of the peptide sequence.

2.2.2 Adding family-specific features

AMP families differ among each other in the set of restrictive prop—
erties found in different regions of their peptide sequences. Different
regions may have different restrictive properties. To select these re—
strictive properties, we used 544 physicochemical properties of
amino acids available in the AAIndex database version 9.1
(Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000). This set was further reduced to
294 properties by selecting a single (randomly selected) property
from those subsets of properties that have mutual Pearson correl—
ation coefficient of 0.9 or higher. This has eliminated the use of mul—
tiple highly correlated properties. To facilitate feature extraction,
we first aligned the peptide sequences of a family using progressive
multiple sequence alignment algorithm (Thompson et (11., 1994).
Then, the restrictive physicochemical properties among the aligned
peptides were determined by excluding one peptide from the family
at a time. Then, we examined whether the property value of all
amino acids in each of the n1, n2, n3, n4, M and C regions of the
excluded peptide is within the min/max values for the same property
determined from the other peptides of the same family in that re—
gion. This test was repeated for all peptides (leave one out test).
Subsequently, physicochemical properties in each region that are
restricted for at least 90% of family peptides were selected to repre—
sent that region. Eventually, the median values of these properties
for individual amino acids in the region entered the feature vector.
This method to identify the restrictive physicochemical properties
is explained as in the algorithm available in Supplementary
Materials S1.1. This algorithm seeks to identify ‘restrictive’ physico—
chemical properties in each region of AMP peptides from a specific
family.

2.3 Data preparation

2.3.1 Normalization

To remove the bias that arises from different ranges of peptide fea—
ture values, we normalized each feature as follows:

x’i :U7 (1)

where x,- is the original feature value, and x’, is the value after

normalization; u,- is the mean of the feature values x,- across all AMP
peptides and a,- is the standard deviation.

2.3.2 Data filtering
We removed from the feature vectors those that have constant val—
ues among peptides of all families.

2.3.3 Target and non-target classes

We performed unsupervised k—means clustering to identify discrim—
inant features of a particular AMP family. Here, the peptides of the
target AMP family under study represent the target class, whereas
peptides from all other families (i.e. those from the remaining 13 tar—
get AMP families and the 291 peptides of the other 114 AMP fami—
lies) represent the non—target class. This process is repeated
independently for each of the 14 target AMP families.

2.4 Selection of AMP family—specific features

To identify compositional and physicochemical properties that dis—
tinguish peptides of a particular target AMP family from all other
AMPs we performed global optimization to select a set of features
based on a genetic algorithm (GA) aimed at minimizing the follow—
ing fitness function:

F : 1 — Fmeasure + Regularization, (2)

We ran the GA with a population size of 1000 to find global opti—
mum within 1000 generations. The crossover rate was set to 0.8 and
mutation rate to 0.01. In each generation, the fitness value of each
individual was evaluated. The F—measure was calculated by perform—
ing unsupervised clustering using the k—means clustering algorithm
with Euclidean distance. We used the known class label of each pep—
tide to evaluate the clustering performance by calculating the true
positives (TPs), true negatives (TNs), false positives (FPs) and false
negatives (FNs). These quantities are used later to calculate the
F—measure. To remove the bias caused by initial random selection of
cluster centroids, we initialized the centroids of clusters using the
means of points in the positive and negative classes. We performed
clustering using different number of clusters ranging from 2 to 15
and selected the number of clusters that gave the highest F—measure
value. For optimum clustering results, all peptides of the target AMP
family under study are grouped in a single cluster that represents the
target class, whereas peptides from all other AMP families may res—
ide in one or more non—target class clusters. The regularization con—
straint is added to encourage the optimization algorithm to select
the minimum number of features that yield the highest F—measure
value. We emphasize that we do not aim at building a predictive
model for the families of AMP peptides, but use this procedure to
identify features that allow for the accurate clustering of peptides
into AMP families.

2.5 Clustering AMPs into antimicrobial families

We examined the capability of the selected properties for each target
AMP family to group the family peptides together and discriminate
them from all other AMPs. For the purpose of testing a specific fam—
ily X, we represented peptides of all families using the set of features

selected for family X and successively performed clustering using
k—means clustering with Euclidean distance. In the optimal case, all
peptides of family X should be grouped in one cluster while peptides
of other families can be distributed in one or more clusters. Based on
this testing criterion, we measured the performance of clustering for
the set of identified properties.

2.6 Model evaluation

After clustering AMPs, the cluster containing the maximum number
of peptides of the target class was selected as the cluster of the target
class. The remaining non—target clusters may contain AMPs from ei—
ther non—target or target class. Therefore, the quality of clustering
was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision,
Jaccard index and F—measure. We used two more evaluation meas—
ures defined in Tan et al. (2006), the entropy and purity. All these
measures are defined as in Supplementary Materials S1.2. All
modules of this computational model were developed using
MATLAB (R2012b).

3 Results

3.1 Feature selection using global optimization of
unsupervised k—means clustering

Peptides of a particular AMP family are described by two sets of fea—
tures (see Section 2). The first set consists of 1 84 features that repre—
sent mainly the amino acid composition in different regions of the
peptide sequences. The second set is composed of restrictive physico—
chemical properties in different regions of the peptide sequences.
The entire set of features, used to represent peptides of a particular
family, contributes in different ways to distinguish one AMP family
from other AMP families. Consequently, we performed feature se—
lection using a GA for global optimization of unsupervised cluster—
ing. The GA is more suitable for optimization of discrete variables
and outperforms other methods such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (Kennedy, 2010) and differential evolution (DE)
(Chakraborty, 2008) as shown in Supplementary Materials S3.1.
Our analysis shows that k—means algorithm provided better cluster—
ing results when compared with other algorithms, e.g. Affinity
Propagation (AP) (Frey and Dueck, 2007) (Supplementary Materials
S3.2). Also, we compared the clustering results using different dis—
tance measures (Euclidean distance, correlation, cosine and city
block). K—means clustering with Euclidean distance yielded better
performance than other measures (Supplementary Materials S3.3)
because AMPs have varying lengths of their sequences, as shown in
Supplementary Figure S1, we performed feature selection for each
AMP family using different lengths of N and C terminals, i.e.
dn:10, 12, 14, 16 and dc: 8, 10. Supplementary Materials S2.3
show the clustering performance using all combinations of terminal
length parameters. Furthermore, feature selection was performed
using different number of clusters (K) where K : 2, 3, . . . ,15.
Columns 2—7 in Table 1 show the values of the parameters that pro—
duced the highest F—measure value.

As shown in Table 1, from the entire set of 9162 features used to
represent all peptides of the 14 target AMP families, a subset of 394
features was selected to distinguish peptides of each AMP family
from any other AMP.

3.2 Clustering AMPs using selected feature subsets

We used the subset of features by GA as characterizing each target
AMP family to perform clustering and test if the peptides of that
family will fall in one cluster while other AMPs would fall in other

clusters. We measured the performance of the clustering using the
known labels of the peptides. Table 2 shows these clustering results
for each target AMP family. We notice the remarkable capability of
the selected features to produce correct clustering with 100% speci—
ficity for 9 of the 14 AMP families, whereas for the remaining five
families specificity values were between 99.17% and 99.86%. The
obtained average values of sensitivity, specificity and precision for
all 14 target AMP families were 92.88%, 99.86% and 95.96%, re—
spectively. Supplementary Figure S2 shows sensitivity versus preci—
sion for the clustering obtained with the selected features.

Results in Table 2 revealed the advantages of characterizing pep—
tide sequences using physicochemical properties. The long distance
interactions between residues in the peptide sequence and similarity
in function between distantly related proteins are likely captured at
least partly using physicochemical properties (Du and Li, 2006; Liu
et (11., 2012). Consequently, using merely the information about
amino acid composition may be insufficient to distinguish AMPs,
determine their specificity toward target cells and characterize their
activities (Maccari et (11., 2013; Pushpanathan et (11., 2013). To test
the importance of physicochemical properties in characterizing
AMP peptide families, we represented AMP peptides using 184 fea—
tures (part1 of the feature vector only) that correspond to informa—
tion mainly about amino acid composition and show in
Supplementary Table S3 the results of clustering with this represen—
tation. The obtained average values of sensitivity, specificity and
precision for all 14 target AMP families were 73.08%, 94.50% and
40.65%, respectively. Sensitivity and precision are significantly
weaker than when using selected restrictive physicochemical and
compositional properties (Table 2).

We additionally demonstrated that clustering using both parts of
the feature vector (i.e. the restrictive features along with the compos—
itional features), but without feature subset selection, did not discern
well peptides of any AMP family, as shown in Supplementary Table
S4. The obtained average values of sensitivity, specificity and preci—
sion for all 14 target AMP families were 73.55%, 91.74% and
31.12%, respectively. Again, sensitivity and precision are signifi—
cantly weaker than when we used selected restrictive physicochemi—
cal and compositional properties (Table 2). These findings showed
the merit of feature subset selection to identify family—specific amino
acid composition and physicochemical properties that characterize
the peptides of the family and discriminate the AMP family from
other AMPs.

A characteristic of our representation of peptide sequences is the
identification of restrictive physicochemical properties in different
regions of the peptide sequence. To compare this representation
with the simple method of using all compositional and physicochem—
ical properties in different regions of the peptide sequence, we used
the entire set of 294 amino acids features in each of the six regions
(n1, n2, n3, n4, M and C), that has resulted into a total of
184 + (294 X 6) : 1948 features without making any further feature
selection. The results of clustering are shown in Supplementary
Table S5. The obtained average values of sensitivity, specificity and
precision for all 14 target AMP families were 63.91%, 93.54% and
32.51%, respectively. Once again, sensitivity and precision are sig—
nificantly lower than when features selected by our method are used
(Table 2), thereby affirming the importance of identifying the re—
strictive physicochemical properties in different regions of the pep—
tide sequence and, then, using feature selection from this subset of
restrictive properties. This is because the majority of properties do
not contribute to distinguishing the AMP families and using them af—
fects the values of the distance measure. Figure 1 and Supplementary
Figure S3 compare the precision and the sensitivity obtained by four
different methods used to represent the AMPs.

3.3 Testing the selected properties on non—AMPs and
other AMP databases

We checked whether the features determined for AMP families
would separate AMPs from non—AMPs. If this is not possible, then
the non—AMPs would have similar feature profiles as some classes of
AMPS. We found that this distinguishing of AMPs from non—AMPs
was possible with an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and
cluster purity of 96.72%, 67.62%, 96.85% and 99.56%, respect—
ively, confirming that features selected for AMP families are highly
specific to AMPs. One should note that our selection of features was
not made with the aim to distinguish AMP families from non—
AMPs. Rather, they were selected to distinguish different AMP fami—
lies from other AMPs.

Furthermore, we evaluated another database CAMP (Waghu
et (11., 2014). We considered only experimentally validated mature
AMP peptide sequences with UNIPROT IDs from CAMP. We tested
if the selected features based on DAMPD database entries would
separate AMP families from CAMP and found that this is possible
with an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and cluster purity
of 94.03%, 76.91%, 94.58% and 97.96%, respectively. This

suggests that the features selected based on DAMPD entries discrim—
inate well between different AMP families in the CAMP database. It
should be mentioned, however, that the criteria for inclusion of
AMPs into CAMP and into DAMPD are not necessarily the same,
so very strict comparison is not possible.

3.4 Selected properties that discriminate AMP families
In total, 394 properties were identified to discriminate each of the
14 target AMP families from all other AMPs (Table 1, Column 6).
The entire set of the selected properties is provided in
Supplementary Materials S6. Different numbers of properties were
identified as being characteristic for different families. For example,
seven properties could discriminate cyclotides (bracelet subfamily)
from all other AMPs with an accuracy of 100%. However, more
properties were needed to discriminate some AMP families from
other AMPs, in particular sub—families of the same super family. For
example, sub—families of the frog skin active peptide (FSAP) family
such as brevinin, caerin and dermaseptin required 118, 28 and 25
properties, respectively.

The selected properties are region—specific within the peptide se—
quence. That is, the properties are identified from the N—terminal, M
region, C—terminal or the entire peptide sequence. Some of the se—
lected properties are related to amino acid sequence composition
features, whereas some others are related to physicochemical prop—
erties. The distribution of the selected properties between these two
categories of features is shown in Table 1, Columns 8 and 9. Amino
acid composition properties are capable of discerning highly differ—
ential AMP family from other families, such as in the case of type A
lantibiotic. However, other 13 families require a combination of
amino acid composition and physicochemical properties to discern
their peptides from other AMPs.

Some of the selected properties indicate the enrichment of a par—
ticular residue(s) or physicochemical property in a specific region,
these properties are called ‘enriched’. However, some other proper—
ties indicate the importance of the absence or depletion of a particu—
lar residue(s) or physicochemical property in a specific region,
which we call them ‘depleted’ properties. For example, among the
selected properties for alpha defensins, the enrichment of arginine
and the depletion of lysine in the C—terminal were identified as im—
portant properties for this family.

4 Discussion

In this work, we developed a novel computational model for selec—
tion of AMP characteristics that discern AMP families via physico—
chemical and compositional properties. The identified AMP
properties make them potential design guides for development of

synthetic AMPs. Also, these properties can be used as a starting
point to develop a classification model to determine the category of
a new candidate AMP. In the subsequent text, enrichment and de—
pletion are considered related to one target AMP family relative to
all other AMP families. Here we comment on the properties selected
for some of the AMP families. Discussion of properties of other fam—
ilies is in Supplementary Materials S5 .

Alpha-defensins. We found enrichment of cysteine (C) in the n3
and n4 regions, arginine (R) in the M region and arginine and tyro—
sine (Y) in the C region, whereas glycine (G) was found depleted in
the n2 region as well as lysine (K) in the C region. Numerous studies
have demonstrated that bactericidal activity is independent of highly
conserved features, such as invariant disulfide array, Arg—Glu salt
bridge or Gly residue at CysIII+8 I, with exception to the high argin—
ine content relative to lysine (Lehrer, 2007; Rajabi et (11., 2008;
Schmidt et (11., 2012), which complies with our finding. Moreover,
Schmidt et al. (2012) demonstrated that the replacement of arginine
with lysine decreases the activity of these peptides (Schmidt et (11.,
2012). Also, AMPs disrupt membranes through a combination of
electrostatic interactions between cationic amino acid side chains
and electronegative components of the microbial cell envelope,
followed by the insertion of hydrophobic patches into the nonpolar
interior of the membrane bilayer (Brogden, 2005 ). The mouse
alpha—defensin cryptdin—4 (Crp4) was demonstrated to induce bac—
tericidal activity via this mechanism (Satchell et (11., 2003). NMR
structure of Crp4 demonstrated its cationic amino acids to be argin—
ine, lysine and histidine (H) and its hydrophobic patches to include
isoleucine (I), leucine (L), valine (V), phenylalanine (F) and tyrosine.
Similar to these findings, we found for alpha—defensins the enrich—
ment of cysteine in the N—region, which, taking into account their
hydropathy index, may suggest that it is a key component of the
hydrophobic patch. The enrichment of arginine and tyrosine likely
adds to the electrostatic interaction that contributes to membrane
disruption.

Beta-defensins. We found arginine, valine, phenylalanine, as—
paragine (N), cysteine and glycine enriched in the n1, n2, n3, n4, n4
and n4 regions, respectively. Also, for the properties extracted from
the n4 sub—region, an enrichment for the parameter of charge trans—
fer donor capacity was found (Charton and Charton, 1983). The M
region exhibited enrichment, of cysteine, whereas the C region had
enrichment of arginine and cysteine. It was proposed that the beta—
defensin N—terminal helix with many hydrophobic residues is in—
serted inside the micelle, whereas the C—terminal helix with one large
positive charge patch is located outside the micelle and interacts
with the charged head groups of the micelle (Chandrababu et (11.,
2009). Of the array of amino acids, we identified valine, phenylalan—
ine and cysteine as key hydrophobic residues enriched in the
N—terminal that likely facilitate the insertion of the beta—defensins
N—terminal helix into the micelles, whereas for the C—terminal helix
arginine is the key amino acid forming the positive charge patch.
Finally, if we only consider amino acids that our study identified as
enriched, we observe cysteine, glycine and arginine most enriched.
Our findings are partly corroborated by the results of Midorikawa
et al. and Chandrababu et al. as they demonstrated that the
beta—defensins are characterized by the enrichment of cysteine. That
is the existence of six conserved cysteine residues (Midorikawa
et (11., 2003) and that the arrangement of cysteine residues in the
three—dimensional space are important to the antimicrobial selectiv—
ity and salt—dependent activity by mutating all six cysteine residues
of human beta—defensin—3 (HBD—3) (Chandrababu et (11., 2009).

Cat/oelicidins. We identified the enrichment of arginine in the n1
and n2 regions. Lysine was identified depleted in the C—region,

whereas proline (P) was enriched in the C—region. Also, for the prop—
erties extracted from the n3 sub—region enrichment for the linker
propensity from 1—linker dataset and normalized frequency of
beta—sheet with weights was found (Levitt, 1978; George and
Heringa, 2002). Our findings are supported by cathelicidins being
characterized as proline—rich and having a highly conserved
N—terminal preprosequences followed by variable C—terminal se—
quences that are biologically active effectors (Zanetti et al., 1995;
Chan et al., 2001). Moreover, the proline was proved to sustain the
antimicrobial activity of mammalian cathelicidins by resisting serine
proteases cleavage of the scissile bond (Shinnar et al., 2003).
Our findings are further supported by cathelicidins from hagfish
exhibiting four arginines positioned between the cathelin domain
and the antimicrobial sequences (Uzzell et al., 2002). The arginine
tetrads of these latent zymogens are believed to be specifically
processes by prohormone convertases such as furin proteases in
specific cells as an activity switch (Steiner, 1998; Rockwell et al.,
2002).

Cecropins. We identified enrichment of lysine and glutamic acid
(E) in the n3 and n4 regions, respectively, whereas alanine was en—
riched in the C—region. Andreu et al. (1983) produced synthetic
cecropin A that induces comparable antibacterial activity and is in—
distinguishable by chemical and physical criteria from the naturally
occurring cecropin A. In partial corroboration with our findings, it
has been demonstrated that cecropin analogs with an impaired
N—terminal helix, such as cecropin A—(3—37) with removed lysine
and tryptophan has reduced membrane disrupting abilities that cor—
relate with their lower antibacterial activity that was rationalized in
terms of reduced binding to bacteria (Andreu et al., 1983; Steiner
et al., 1988). Similarly, Fink et al. (1989) demonstrated via a chem—
ically synthesized cecropin D analog (9—37) that no activity is
observed without phenylalanine and glutamic acid in the N—ter—
minal. Moreover, Lee et al. (1989) demonstrated that lysine, glu—
tamic acid and arginine are conserved in cecropins and that alanine
is enriched.

Cyclotides. We only identified a few properties related to com—
position, such as enrichment of glutamic acid and glycine in the n4
and C—regions, respectively. For the properties extracted from the
C—region enrichment for normalized frequency of turn in alpha +
beta class was found (Palau et al., 1982). Work by Hermann et al.
partially supports these finding as they demonstrated that methyla—
tion of charged glutamic acid residue of cyclotide cycloviolacin 02
decreased its potency 48—fold. They additionally showed conserved
cysteine residues and demonstrated that acetylation of the two lysine
residues also reduced the potency 3—fold (Herrmann et al., 2006).
Koehbach et al. elucidated the structure of kalata B7 to determine
its associated ligand—receptor interaction. They inferred an
interaction with the oxytocin receptor owing to loop 3 of kalata B7
(—CYTQGC—) being homologous to the six—residue ring sequence of
oxytocin. They further exhibited the crucial role of the tyrosine and
glutamine residues (loop 3) by generating mutated variants
(Y replaced by A, S or F; Q was replaced by A or E), all of which were
inactive or did not bind to the receptor (Koehbach et al., 2013).
Moreover, Rosengren et al. (2003) demonstrated that most cyclotides
have a glycine positioned before the cysteine residue to form the
f angle required for the type II b—turn needed for cyclization.

5 Conclusion

The increased demand of AMPs brought attention to in-silico meth—
ods to design novel AMPs. In this study, we identified properties
that strongly discriminate AMPs families from each other using

global optimization of unsupervised clustering by GA. Our results
suggest that the identified features can be used to filter out unlikely
synthetic candidate AMPs during the design process of novel AMPs.
The methodology developed here is generic and with a potential to
characterize arbitrary protein family.

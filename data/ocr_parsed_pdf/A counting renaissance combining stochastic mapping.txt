A counting renaissance

 

variation maintained by population structure or balancing selec—
tion (Pybus and Rambaut, 2009). The impact of immune pres—
sure on the genetic diversity of viruses can be highly dependent
on how potent the immune responses are to different viral vari—
ants, a concept that has been put forward within the framework
of phylodynamics (Grenfell et al., 2004). For this reason, meth—
ods to estimate a) have become an integral part of the ‘phylody—
namic toolbox’ (Pybus and Rambaut, 2009), which generally
refers to recent statistical and computational developments to
simultaneously estimate epidemic and spatiotemporal dynamics
from viral genes sequences (Lemey et al., 2009, 2010).

In this article, we are interested in site—specif1c estimation of
(1N /dg ratios. There are two main classes of methods designed for
this task. The ﬁrst class prescribes to build a model of codon
evolution, with the (IN /dg ratio as a model parameter that is
allowed to vary across sites (Nielsen and Yang, 1998; Pond
and Muse, 2005). Although we fully endorse these approaches
and use them whenever possible, codon—based models become
computationally prohibitive when analyzing large datasets that
include hundreds, if not thousands, of molecular sequences
(Lemey et al., 2007). Because of this computational limitation,
researchers often turn to a second class of methods that are based
on imputing (counting) unobserved synonymous and non—syn—
onymous substitutions (Suzuki and Gojobori, 1999). These sub—
stitution counts are then used to construct a test statistic to assess
the null hypothesis of neutrality (H0 : (1N /dg = 1). Such counting
methods enjoy computational efﬁciency and often work well in
practice (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005), but have two im—
portant shortcomings. First, counting approaches experience dif—
f1culties in handling uncertainty about the phylogenetic tree and
about other nuisance parameters that play a role in counting
unobserved synonymous and non—synonymous substitutions.
Zhai et a]. (2007) propose to overcome this problem by combin—
ing stochastic mapping, introduced by Nielsen (2002), with trad—
itional counting methods’ test statistics as discrepancy measures
in a posterior predictive diagnostics framework (Gelman et al.,
1996). However, posterior predictive diagnostics, undoubtedly
useful for visual exploration of model ﬁt, are difﬁcult to calibrate
and to use in a semi—automatic fashion. The second limitation,
shared by all counting methods, is their inability to provide
reliable sites—speciﬁc (1N /dg estimates and to quantify the relative
strengths of selection across amino acid sites.

2 APPROACH

We propose a new counting method that overcomes both of the
aforementioned shortcomings. Our solution arises in two steps.
In the ﬁrst step, we follow Nielsen (2002) and Zhai et a1. (2007)
and produce multiple stochastic mapping—based realizations of
synonymous and non—synonymous counts while integrating over
the posterior distribution of the nuissance parameters including
the phylogenetics tree. However, to gain computational tractabil—
ity, we exploit nucleotide—based codon partition models (Yang,
1996) in this step. These models can be fit to data in a fraction of
the time it takes to ﬁt even the simplest codon—based evolution—
ary models ﬁrst introduced by Muse and Gaut (1994) and
Goldman and Yang (1994). Although codon partition models
do not account for selective pressures at amino acid sites
(dN /dg is one for all sites under these models), emerging

probabilistic counting procedures have been shown to be
robust to such gross model misspecif1cation (Minin and
Suchard, 2008b; Minin et al., 2011; O’Brien et al., 2009).

The second step of our approach is the main novelty of this
article. We treat each random realization of synonymous and
non—synonymous counts as pseudo—data and shrink these
site—speciﬁc counts toward their means over all sites. We accom—
plish this regularization through an empirical Bayes procedure.
We then use these regularized synonymous and non—synonymous
counts to form site—specif1c (1N /dg estimates. The end result is a
posterior distribution of these ratios for all sites in the alignment.
This distribution can be used for estimation [e.g. we report the
posterior mean and 95% credible intervals (CIs) of site—speciﬁc
(1N /dg values] and for testing diversifying positive selection (e. g. a
site is classiﬁed as positively selected if the posterior probability
of (1N /dg >1 at this site is at least, say, 0.95). Empirical Bayes
and, similar in spirit, full hierarchical Bayesian methods have
been developed before for site—specif1c (1N /dg estimation and
for identifying sites under diversifying positive selection
(Huelsenbeck and Dyer, 2004; Yang et al., 2005). However, to
our knowledge, we are the first to combine empirical Bayes phil—
osophy and counting approaches, providing a revival of these
simple methods to confront a formidable inferential problem. By
performing the empirical Bayes regularization on the imputed
count data, we avoid fitting computationally expensive codon—
based models, making our ‘renaissance counting’ method prac—
tical for analyzing large datasets.

We assess our method using a simulation study almost iden—
tical to the one conducted and validated by Kosakovsky Pond
and Frost (2005). The simulations demonstrate that our meth—
od’s site—specif1c (1N /dg estimates and positively selected site iden—
tif1cation are remarkably comparable with the estimates
produced by the state—of—the—art codon—based models. We also
apply our new renaissance approach to two empirical datasets.
First, we reanalyze serially sampled feline panleukopenia and
canine parvovirus VP2 capsid sequences. This analysis shows
that renaissance counting produces sensible site—specific (1N /dg
estimates, simultaneously accounting for uncertainty in all
model parameters, and highlights important differences between
our new and codon—based methods. We conclude by using our
method in tandem with conventional approaches to examine dif—
ferences in adaptive evolution in HIV pol genes in treated and
drug naive patient populations.

3 METHODS

3.1 Probabilistic counting under a codon partition model

Let y = {yﬂ} be a codon alignment matrix, where i spans n sequences,
1 runs over L sites in the alignment and each yij is one of 64 nucleotide
triplets (codons). We assume that each site y] follows a codon partition
model, meaning that each nucleotide position 3: 1, 2, 3 within a codon
evolves independently along a phylogenetic tree 1', according to one of the
standard nucleotide substitution models (Yang, 1996). In all our examples
and without loss of generality, we use a Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano
(1985) model (HKY85) for each nucleotide position, with position-
speciﬁc transition/transversion ratio KN, substitution rate p“. and station-
ary distribution 11,. = (HAN, ...,rrn). Position rates are normalized for
identiﬁability for contemporaneously sampled sequences, but remain
free parameters in the case of serially sampled data.

We ﬁt the above codon partition model in a Bayesian framework and
use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration to obtain a sample
from the posterior distribution of model parameters Pr(0|y), where
0 = (T,K1, K2, [(3, u], #2, p.341], 112,113). Let 0]- be parameter values at
MCMC iteration j. At each iteration j, we use stochastic mapping to
impute the full evolutionary history of each nucleotide position within
each codon site in our alignment (Nielsen, 2002). We capitalize on a
uniformization method, a modiﬁcation of the original approach by
Nielsen (2002), to draw realizations of the HKY continuous-time
Markov chains (CTMCs) conditional on the codon data at the tips of
the phylogeny r]- (Lartillot, 2006; Rodrigue et al., 2008). See Hobolth and
Stone (2009) for an excellent review of different stochastic mapping al-
gorithms. We also use simple forward CTMC simulation to draw the full
evolutionary history of each site without conditioning on the data for
normalization. For each stochastic mapping realization, conditional
(C) and unconditional (U) on the data, we record the numbers of syn-
onymous (S) substitutions CEZS'C), CEZS'U) and non-synonymous (N) sub-
stitutions C(YN'C), Cﬁq'U) for each site I = 1, . . . , L. Computing the ratio
(C(N'Cl/C(S'C))/ (C(N'Ul/ds'm) yields one straightforward way of con-
verting these site-speciﬁc synonymous and non-synonymous counts into
site-speciﬁc dN/ds values. However, this naive method produces highly
unstable estimates due to the high variance of site-speciﬁc substitution
counts. Moreover, in many cases, some of the substitutions counts are
zero, resulting in a dN /ds estimate of 0 or 00. To circumvent these prob-
lems, we apply an empirical Bayes regularization procedure to each of the
four substitution counts, producing regularized rate estimates Allis-C),
LIES-U), Air-C) and Air-U). With the regularized rate estimates at hand,
we form our dN/dS estimates
wjic = (AEF'C’MEIS'CW(AEF'Ul/Ajf'm)- (1)
We explain our empirical Bayes regularization procedure in detail in the
next section.

3.2 Regularized site-speciﬁc dN/ds ratios

Within each MCMC iteration, we view the realized values of synonymous
and non-synonymous substitutions as pseudo-data. As our empirical
Bayes regularization procedure is identical for all four types of imputed
counts, we use the generic notation C1 to denote one of the four possible
count types, CEN'C),CES'C), CEN'U) and CES'U), at site 1. Each of these
counts represents the number of speciﬁcally labelled jumps of the
codon model CTMC. In general, such random variables follow non-
standard distributions that reduce to a Poisson distribution only in special
cases (Minin and Suchard, 2008a). However, in the phylogenetic context,
a Poisson distribution approximates these non-standard distributions
very well (Siepel et al., 2006). Therefore, we assume that

C1~ Poisson (A1)forl = 1, ..., L, (2)

where A; is an unknown site-speciﬁc Poisson rate. Next, we postulate a
hierarchical model by assuming that

A; ~ Gamma(oz, ﬂ), (3)

where the hierarchical prior carries unknown shape at and rate )3.

This second model level enables information sharing across sites so
that sites with low counts can borrow information from more informative
sites. This hierarchical model can be ﬁtted in a fully Bayesian framework
by approximating the posterior distribution Pr(a,ﬁ,A|C), where
A = (A1, ...,AL) and C = (C1, ...,CL). Alternatively, one can ﬁrst
obtain estimates 6; and )3 from the marginal probability density
Pr(C|oz,/3) and then arrive at site-speciﬁc rate estimates in the form of
the expectations [E(A1|C,&,/§) for I: 1, ...,L (Robbins, 1956). Maritz
(1969) explores parametric and non-parametric hierarchical Poisson
models and ﬁnds that even a simple gamma-Poisson model produces
empirical Bayes estimates that enjoy good statistical properties.

To execute our empirical Bayes approach, we start with sample means
and variances

In summary, to obtain a sample from the posterior distribution of the

(1) Draw M samples from the posterior distribution of model param-

model, and then

3.3 Computational considerations

Our site-speciﬁc dN/dS estimation method has two main steps. This ﬁrst
and the most time consuming step involves obtaining a posterior MCMC
sample under the nucleotide-based codon partition model. An analogous
step for the simplest codon models with no rate heterogeneity (Muse and
Gaut, 1994; Goldman and Yang, 1994) takes at best 612/42/3 % 80 times
as long, but in practice, performs worse, as the computational work of
matrix exponentiation for the codon model becomes non-negligible. In
the second step, we use stochastic mapping coupled with empirical Bayes
regularization. Our empirical Bayes regularization of the imputed substi-
tution counts is accomplished almost instantaneously because this esti-
mation procedure does not involve computationally intensive
calculations. The imputation step is potentially time consuming, but we
draw stochastic mapping realizations for a small number of saved
MCMC iterations (103 — 104), which is typically orders of magnitude
smaller than the length of the entire Markov chain (106 — 107).
Therefore, the running time of our two-step procedure is dominated by
the ﬁrst step, making our approach signiﬁcantly faster than Bayesian
site-speciﬁc dN/ds estimation under codon-based models.

3.4 Identifying sites under selection

To classify sites as negatively selected, neutrally evolving or positively
selected, we use for each site I the posterior sample {(059 ...,wfffl ,
to estimate the 95% CI (wgg% . ,,w.§‘7?5% .1). Alternatively, we could use
a 95% highest posterior density region. We declare site I to be under

diversifying positive selection if 1 < wEEo/o . 1, neutral if

w§g:%.l< 1 <w§7(_:5%.1, and under negative selection if 1>w§7_cso/o . 1. Notice
that we can not say anything about frequentist properties of this classi-
ﬁcation procedure. In other words, our method is not guaranteed to
classify a site correctly 95% of the time during repeated replications of
the evolutionary process. However, we point out that our new method
offers more than merely a classification algorithm. In addition to clas-
sifying sites into the three categories above, we can assess the relative
strengths of selection at individual sites by comparing site-speciﬁc CIs,
including their relative rankings and the degree of overlap. To compare
the use of a per-site dN /ds posterior distribution with a frequentist count-
ing approach, we also explore a test procedure that only conditions on
the expectations for the conditional and unconditional counts,
CEIS-C’, C‘EIS'U’,C$\"C’ and CEIN'U’, for each site I to compute P-values
using the extended binomial (EBin) distribution, as discussed in
Kosakovsky Pond and Frost (2005).

4 RESULTS

4.1 Performance

We conduct an extended simulation study to compare the
relative performance of the renaissance approach to the
state—of—the—art random effects likelihood codon—based model
that accomodates both non—synonymous and synonymous
rate variation across sites (DUAL REL) and the ﬁxed effects
likelihood (FEL) model approach implemented in HyPhy
(Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2005). We reanalyze the datasets simu—
lated by Kosakovsky Pond and Frost (2005). Briefly, the simu—
lation procedure considers symmetric bifurcating trees with 8, 16,
32 and 64 tips and generates alignments encompassing 375
codons with a complex distribution of non—synonymous and syn—
onymous substitution rates (resulting in 75 neutral, 335 nega—
tively selected and 75 positively selected sites) (Kosakovsky
Pond and Frost, 2005). We further extend this study to the
128—tip case and focus on the more realistic 16, 32, 64 and 128
range. Codon—based model substitution parameters were inspired
by HIV polymerase sequence data, and 50 different replicates are
generated for each collection of parameters.

We first focus on the binary classiﬁcation problem of iden—
tifying sites under diversifying positive selection and map the
proportion of misidentiﬁed sites (false positive rate) to the
proportion of correctly identiﬁed sites (true positive rate) for
various nominal at levels (P—values, empirical Bayes factors
based on the ratio of posterior and prior odds of having
a) 75 l, or posterior quantiles) of the test procedures we com—
pare. The resulting receiver operating characteristic curves for
renaissance counting, DUAL REL and FEL are presented in
Figure 1. For renaissance counting, we focus on the results for
the CI coverage test approach (Supplementary Fig. S1 shows
the EBin test has a very similar performance). Although the
DUAL REL approach performs marginally better for a lower
number of taxa, FEL beneﬁts more from a large number of
taxa. In general, the renaissance approach competes well with
the codon model approaches with a roughly intermediate per—
formance across the different simulation scenarios. Although
the renaissance counting receiver operating characteristic
curves are similar for CI coverage test and the EBin test
(Supplementary Fig. S1), reasonably low false positive rates
do not require very low EBin P—values, but they do require
relative high posterior quantiles in the coverage approach

performance of renaissance counting (RC), DUAL REL and FEL meth-
ods in identifying sites under diversifying positive selection. The curves
plot true and false positive rates as functions of varying test-statistics.
P-values, Bayes factors and posterior quantiles were used for FEL (blue
line), DUAL REL (red line) and RC (black line), respectively

(Supplementary Table S1). The EBin critical P—values also
clearly decrease with the number of taxa for the same false
positive rate, whereas a similar trend is not so obvious for the
posterior quantiles. We anticipate that cut off values sensitive
to the number of taxa will also be affected by sequence diver—
gence, and only data—speciﬁc simulation provides an objective
way to select such values.

Next, we investigate the ability of the renaissance approach
to estimate site—specific (1N /dg values. In Figure 2, we compare
the mean relative errors of such site—specific estimation pro—
duced by our method, DUAL REL and FEL during the ana—
lysis of the 128—taxa simulated dataset. As the total number of
simulations is fairly small, owing to the high computational
costs of DUAL REL and FEL under phylogenetic tree uncer—
tainty, we also report 95% Monte Carlo error (grey shaded
areas). Although the renaissance approach tends to overesti—
mate small dN/dg values, our method performs remarkably
well when the true (ZN/(lg values are above or equal to one,
the situation in which practitioners are most interested. This
error pattern is reversed for the REL method, outperforming
the renaissance method on small (1N /dg values, but loses to our
approach on sites under positive selection. The relative errors of
the FEL method are difﬁcult to quantify owing to the fact that
this method occasionally produces unreasonably high (1N /dg
estimates. If we remove inﬁnite (1N / (lg estimates during the rela—
tive error calculations, FEL still produces unreasonably high
(1N /dg estimates on some of the remaining simulations
(bottom left plot in Fig. 2). Only when we remove (1N /dg esti—
mates that are above 10000 do we arrive at reasonable (but
now biased) relative errors for the FEL method. Although after
this ﬁltering, the FEL approach outperforms both the renais—
sance and REL methods, the FEL approach remains problem—
atic because for some of the sites, it fails to provide reasonable
(1N /dg estimates in as many as 11 simulations (22% of all
simulations).

4.2 Empirical data

We analyze a feline and carnivore parvovirus dataset to compare
renaissance counting implemented in BEAST (Drummond et al.,
2012) to REL codon—based model approaches. This dataset in—
cludes 91 VP2 capsid sequences sampled from various geograph—
ical regions for a 42—year period and was previously used to
demonstrate the rapid adaptation of feline panleukopenia parvo—
virus to canine hosts (Shackelton et al., 2005). Table 1 lists the
positively selected sites identiﬁed using renaissance counting and
REL approaches, and Supplementary Figure S2 plots the
site—speciﬁc DUAL REL (1N /dg estimates against the renaissance
counting (1N /dg estimates and their CIs. The REL approaches
include non—synonymous (NS REL) and both non—synonymous
and synonymous (DUAL REL) rate variation across sites. To
model this rate variation, we used generalized discrete distribu—
tions with three rate categories. The DUAL REL model provides
a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt when compared with the NS REL model
(P< 0.001), indicating signiﬁcant variation in (lg across sites.
Shackelton et a]. (2005) originally use a NS REL approach as
implemented in PAML [Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum
Likelihood, Yang, (1997)] and relied on fairly conservative cri—
teria to identify positive selected sites (underlined in Table 1). If
we use the criterion of (052% >1 for renaissance counting and a
log Bayes factor (for (1N /dg > 1)> 4.0 for the REL models, which
is indeed the cut off that corresponds to a false positive rate of
5% according to data—speciﬁc simulations (data not shown), then
these three approaches provide support for roughly the same
sites as being positively selected with few exceptions. The FEL
approach, however, does not yield support for any site under
positive diversifying selection unless one is willing to accept
high critical P—values as evidence. In Table l, we also report
results of a single—likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) method

(Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005), a more advanced version of
the original counting method of Suzuki and Gojobori (1999),
which performs similarly to the FEL model. The same issues
that emerged in the simulation analyses also complicate the
site—speciﬁc (IN/(ls estimation by FEL for this dataset, and, for
this reason, Kosakovsky Pond and Frost (2005) suggested to use
scaled (1N minus (lg as a measure of selection to compare FEL
with other methods. Similar to the FEL and SLAC P—values, the
EBin P—values derived from the average counts for each site are
of little use compared with a test approach that draws informa—
tion from the posterior distribution of regularized site—speciﬁc
(ZN/(15 ratios. The poor performance of these approaches may
be attributed to the relatively low diversity in this dataset (mean
pairwise diversity of 0.0086 substitutions per site). Between the
two clear exceptions to the consistency of renaissance counting
and REL results, site 101 is only identiﬁed by NS REL to be
under positive selection. When also considering rate variation for
synonymous substitutions, this site falls under a class with high
synonymous substitution rates in DUAL REL, resulting also in a
considerably lower (1N /dg. So, it appears that despite conserva—
tive assignment, site 101 may be falsely identiﬁed as being posi—
tively selected when synonymous rate variation across sites is
ignored. In this respect, renaissance counting is in better agree—
ment with DUAL REL, and, in general, the renaissance esti—
mates are in good agreement with the posterior (1N / (lg
expectations estimated by DUAL REL. Both REL approaches
find support for site 491 being under positive diversifying selec—
tion, despite the observation that the site also experiences a high
synonymous substitution rate (S rate class 2 3 in DUAL REL),
whereas renaissance counting classiﬁes the site as neutrally evol—
ving. For this site, only two unrelated sequences have a different
amino acid (histidine and arginine) compared with the wild—type
amino acid (glutamine). These amino acid substitutions on ex—
ternal branches could therefore represent (slightly) deleterious
substitutions that have subsequently experienced purifying selec—
tion (Lemey et al., 2007; Pond et al., 2006). For renaissance
counting, similar to other counting and FEL approaches, we
can restrict ourselves to summarizing the substitution history
on internal branches only to avoid the impact of such transient
mutations.

To appreciate the computational efﬁciency that renaissance
counting affords, we ﬁrst recall that direct run—time comparison
with the existing implementation of the REL and FEL models is
flawed because these implementations condition on a fixed tree.
In this article, we overcome this implementation limitation by
averaging results over an arbitrarily sized sample of trees from
their posterior distribution, leading to almost arbitrarily long
run—times. Alternatively, a slight underestimate of the computa—
tional cost to fit a full Bayesian REL model entails a full
Bayesian ﬁtting of the codon—based M0 model. For this example,
the codon—based model takes 92>< longer to ﬁt than performing
renaissance counting using an Intel Xeon E5620 CPU running at
2.4 GHz. Recently, Suchard and Rambaut (2009) introduce mas—
sive parallelization for ﬁtting large state—space models through
the BEAGLE library (Ayres et al., 2012). Even when exploiting a
Tesla C2050 graphics processing unit for ﬁtting M0, renaissance
counting still runs 3>< faster on the CPU.

site—speciﬁc selection patterns for partial HIV pol gene sequences

substitutions per site for the treated and untreated dataset, re—
spectively), the FEL approach does now result in convincing
P—values for a number of sites. All three methods provide signifi—
cant support for four sites under adaptation (site 69, 200, 207
and 215). Of those, amino acid substitutions at site 69 and 215
are known to confer resistance to AZT (Larder and Kemp,
1989), albeit mostly in combination with other substitutions for
site 69 (Fitzgibbon et al., 1991; Winters and Merigan, 2001). The
presence of speciﬁc substitutions at position 207 has also been
correlated with reduced AZT susceptibility in biologically cloned
HIV—1 isolates [Q207D and Q207E, (Stoeckli et al., 2002)], and
in vitro evidence conﬁrmed decreased AZT susceptibility owing
to Q207D while this substitution also increased the relative fit—
ness of AZT—resistant HIV—1 (Lu et al., 2005). Site 200 also
undergoes adaptive evolution in the untreated dataset and
most likely reﬂects selection from the cellular immune response,
rather than antiviral therapy (see below). Substitutions at other
sites listed in Table 2 may also bear some relation to nucleoside
analogue resistance and AZT resistance in particular [e. g. V35M
(Cane et al., 2007), T39A (Saracino et al., 2006), V601 (Huigen
et al., 2006), R83K (Svicher et al., 2006), T200A (De Luca et al.,
2006) and R211K (Kemp et al., 1998)], but these are generally
considered to be ‘accessory’ substitutions that are supported by
indirect evidence with little or no in vitro conﬁrmation.

Only two sites are identiﬁed as positively selected by all three
methods in the drug naive dataset using the same signiﬁcance
criteria as mentioned above (site 35 and 200). Twenty—three
records can be retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV cytotoxic
T—lymphocyte (CTL)/CD8+ T—Cell epitope database for epi—
topes that span site 35. Importantly, when patients elicit CTL
responses against this epitope, they are generally directed against
amino acid variation at site 35 (Karlsson et al., 2007), which
makes this an example of virus evolution to the consensus B
sequence (35V). Site 200 is also located in ﬁve epitopes listed in
the CTL/CD8+ T—Cell epitope database, but we could not
retrieve any information concerning speciﬁc amino acid variation

at site 200 that induces different CTL responses. Without such
information, it remains difﬁcult to establish a clear role for par—
ticular positions in immune evasion. In fact, the collection of
reported epitopes covers the majority of Reverse Transcriptase
amino acid positions, and it is therefore not surprising that many
sites listed in Table 3 can be mapped to known HIV—1 epitopes.

5 DISCUSSION

We present a novel and efﬁcient Bayesian method for detecting
positive diversifying selection in molecular sequences. Our
method combines the computational speed of counting methods
and statistical efﬁciency of empirical Bayes approaches. A fur—
ther strength of the method is its simplicity of implementation,
thanks to recent algorithmic advances in stochastic mapping
(Nielsen, 2002; Lartillot, 2006). Stochastic mapping has been
used before to speed up MCMC—based Bayesian estimation of
codon—based models (Rodrigue et al., 2008), but this and subse—
quent approaches still operate within the codon—based modeling
framework. In contrast, our method uses stochastic mapping to
quickly approximate codon—based models that account for rate
variation of (1N /dg over sites. Our analysis of simulated and real
data demonstrates that the proposed approach competes well
with more computationally demanding methods in recovering
site—speciﬁc (1N /dg ratios and in accurately identifying sites
under positive diversifying selection.

The main distinction between renaissance counting and previ—
ous attempts to use stochastic mapping to detect diversifying
positive selection (Zhai et al., 2007) is the ability of our renais—
sance method to directly estimate (1N /dg ratios and to quantify
uncertainty in these estimates. This advance is important because
all counting methods, including stochastic mapping—based ones,
can only produce site—speciﬁc P—values, resulting from testing a
null hypothesis of neutrality. However, it is well known that
using P—values has limitations. In particular, as P—values are
always calculated by conditioning on the null hypothesis, it

A counting renaissance

 

would be inappropriate to use the magnitude of P—values as evi—
dence in favor of the null (Goodman, 1999). The task of compar—
ing P—values becomes even more challenging in the method of
Zhai et al. (2007) because these authors use notoriously hard—to—
calibrate posterior predictive P—values (Hjort et al., 2006).
Therefore, it is difﬁcult to use previously developed counting
methods to quantify relative strength of selection at amino acid
sites. Although our method cannot possibly resolve the
long—standing statistical controversy of quantifying evidence in
hypothesis testing, renaissance counting offers a straightforward
estimation alternative by producing site—speciﬁc posterior distri—
butions of (1N /dg ratios. Importantly, this uniquely positions
renaissance counting among other positive selection detection
methods as a method that also appropriately quantiﬁes the rela—
tive strengths of selection at individual sites.

When imputing/counting the unobserved synonymous and
non—synonymous substitutions, we produce substitution counts
on each branch of the phylogenetic tree and then sum them up
for each site. If a scientiﬁcally meaningful partition of branches
into groups exists, we can easily sum the substitutions within
each group separately and apply our empirical Bayes procedure
to the site—speciﬁc counts in each group. For applications to
within—host HIV evolution for example, we can consider syn—
onymous and non—synonymous substitutions only on internal
branches of the phylogeny. This partition of branch lengths is
motivated by a widely accepted hypothesis that many terminal
branches of intrahost HIV phylogenies represent lineages that
are weeded out by selection (Pond et al., 2006). Therefore, it is
reasonable, if not advisable, to avoid the mutational load on
these branches and their impact on substitution rates (Lemey
et al., 2007) by excluding them when identifying positive diver—
sifying selection.

Concerning the identiﬁcation site—speciﬁc selection patterns,
the development of renaissance counting was clearly not to
replace, but to complement existing methodology. Even after a
comprehensive evaluation of several counting—based and max—
imum likelihood methods, Kosakovsky Pond and Frost (2005)
found it difficult to make deﬁnitive recommendations on which
methods to use in particular cases. In fact, they concluded that a
consensus of several methods, but each accepting relatively high
nominal or levels, would be a reasonable approach to rule out
spurious results. In many ways, renaissance counting presents an
interesting candidate method to include in such a consensus
approach. Embedded in a Bayesian inference framework, renais—
sance counting accounts for phylogenetic error when estimating
(1N /dg ratios. Perhaps more importantly, our approach uses a
test statistic that is very different from both previous counting
methods and maximum likelihood methods. For small or less
divergent datasets, for example the test used in previous counting
methods is notoriously conservative (Kosakovsky Pond and
Frost, 2005), which is also conﬁrmed by our comparison of the
EBin test to the CI coverage test. Empirical Bayesian analysis of
random—effects models on the other hand can suffer from
large Type I error rates owing to excessive errors in the param—
eter estimates used (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005).
Renaissance counting avoids the estimation of codon model
parameters, and estimation uncertainty will be taken into ac—
count by the CI coverage test approach. The nucleotide—model
approximation also offers a signiﬁcant speed—up compared with

ﬁtting a codon model, but considerable computation time may
still need to be invested in integrating over the posterior distri—
bution of phylogenies. In this respect, we emphasize that renais—
sance counting is implemented in a Bayesian inference
framework [BEAST (Drummond et al., 2012)] that provides
access to an array of ﬂexible models for estimating genealogical
history, divergence times, ﬂexible semi—parametric demographic
and phylogeographic histories (Lemey et al., 2009, 2010).
Although site—speciﬁc selection patterns may not be of prime
interest when engaging in such analyses, renaissance counting
readily delivers (1N /dg ratios for any coding sequence alignment,
which may offer a starting point for in—depth characterization of
selection pressures involving different methods.

ABSTRACT

Summary: WewDock TDW is a modification of the pre-existing
ViewDock Chimera extension (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)
used to visualize results of virtual screening experiments. By combing
TDW hardware and an enhanced ViewDock interface, dozens of
ligand—protein complexes are rendered simultaneously to parallelize
the analysis of candidate ligands. The ViewDock TDW GUI allows
the user to easily and interactively manipulate the molecules on the
TDW as an entire set, a selected subset or a single ligand—protein
complex and preserves all Chimera functionality.

Availability and Implementation: ViewDock TDW is an open
source software; freely available on the web at http://www.tdw-
prime.webs.com. Chimera UCSF is also available, free of charge,
at http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/

1 INTRODUCTION

As an alternative to costly high-throughput empirical screening of
millions of compounds, virtual screening has led to tremendous
success in drug discovery (Kitchen et (11., 2004) by computationally
identifying compounds with higher probability of strong binding
afﬁnity to the target protein. These data are used to make ‘informed’
decisions in constructing a shorter list of compounds to purchase and
test in the lab, signiﬁcantly reducing the cost and time to discovery.

Growing databases of small molecules (Baykoucheva, 2007;
Irwin et (11., 2006) and rigorous virtual screening methods demand
greater computational resources. High performance computing
solutions, such as Grid computing (Levesque et (11., 2008), have
proved to be useful tools but visual analysis of resulting data remains
as a bottleneck in the workﬂow. Visualizing hundreds to thousands of
ligand—protein complexes one at a time, limits a researcher’s ability
to compare and contrast candidate compounds. Identifying details
of chemical binding poses, recurring or unique chemical moieties,
and false positives are more likely when multiple structures are
analyzed simultaneously, whether this be two side-by-side or more
than 20 structures.

A Tiled Display Wall (TDW) is a computing cluster with one
or more displays (tiles) connected to each computer (node) of
the cluster. They are typically dedicated for visualization of large

datasets in the form of high-resolution images (Wei et (11., 2000).
Although the use of TDW clusters in drug discovery workﬂows is
limited, their conﬁguration can vary in size and can be as simple as
two networked computers, which makes it an appealing technology
for high-throughput virtual screening.

ViewDock TDW was designed for a hardware setup consisting
of one node as the control node with its own display, keyboard
and mouse, and the render nodes running instances of Chimera
(Petterson et (11., 2004) on the TDW. From the control node, ﬁles of
ligand—protein structure data are selected and Chimera commands
are sent to the render nodes. This setup allows the user to compare
and visualize dozens of ligand—receptor interactions in parallel, thus
providing a means to analyze virtual screening results more quickly,
thoroughly, and effectively.

2 VIEWDOCK TDW DESCRIPTION

ViewDock TDW controls Chimera instances running on the render
nodes by taking advantage of the pre-existing function of accepting
information and instructions from hyperlinks in a web browser,
referred to as Chimera web data. In ViewDock TDW, these web data
are in the form of SSH (Secure SHell) remote calls sending Chimera
commands that are interpreted by instances of Chimera on the render
nodes. ‘Tile’ objects were designed in ViewDock TDW’s python code
to allow the control node to manage display tiles and their associated
structures. A ‘tile’ object contains all the information regarding
a particular instance of Chimera including the node running the
instance and the port number used to send commands to speciﬁed
molecules. The use of common scripting languages and command
line tools driving the functionality of ViewDock TDW makes it
compatible with most existing Unix-based TDWs.

ViewDock TDW scales to any number of tiles and allows the
user to specify the position and number of instances of Chimera
displayed on each tile. With resulting ligand binding conformation
data from the molecular docking software DOCK (Lang et (11.,
2008), the user can compare the ligand—protein interactions, number
of hydrogen bonds and calculated energy scores from DOCK
all in parallel. Given that common TDW conﬁgurations contain
16—20 tiles, ViewDock TDW allows the user to View and control
32—40 molecules simultaneously. Surface generations or hydrogen-
bond calculations can be time-consuming on a single computer for
multiple structures. ViewDock TDW performs these operations in
parallel on the render nodes signiﬁcantly reducing required CPU
time.

3 EXAMPLE USAGE

The visualization step of the virtual screening workﬂow is the ﬁnal
review of the in silico molecular docking and scoring results data.
While scoring algorithms based on binding energy functions provide
a method to rank the ligands from most to least likely hits, visually
examining the predicted conformations of the ligands bound to the
target protein is necessary for selecting a set of ligands to purchase
and test empirically in the lab. After starting ViewDock TDW on
the control node for the ﬁrst time, the user is asked to deﬁne the
TDW dimensions and hostnames of each tile, which are saved for
ﬁiture sessions. The user then selects the ﬁle containing multiple
ligand structures, in their target protein-binding conformations, and
Chimera instances open on the render nodes with the ﬁrst set of
ligands. Chimera automatically adjusts to ﬁill display resolution on
the render nodes and splits for one or more instances per display.
Figure 1A is a screenshot of the ViewDock TDW GUI on the
control node. The candidate ligands’ compound IDs, calculated
binding scores and categories to group ligands are controlled in
the main ViewDock TDW GUI. All communication to the TDW is
facilitated through the ViewDock TDW GUI via keyboard commands
and predeﬁned buttons. In the ‘Tile Speciﬁc Commands’ window,
the user selects structures of interest and subsequent commands are
sent only to the selected molecules. Structure rotation, viewing angle
manipulation and preset display operations were mapped to hotkeys
and GUI button elements. For more advanced control, user-speciﬁed
Chimera commands can be sent to render nodes using the ‘Cmd’
window and the selected structure shown on the control node display
can be manipulated using the mouse just as with Chimera on its own.
Figure 1B shows a TDW running ViewDock TDW to review
candidate ligands bound to the catalytic domain of the protein
tyrosine phosphatase SHP-l [PDB ID: lFPR]. Using the ‘User
Speciﬁed Commands’ window, surface transparency was changed
and hydrogen bond thickness was increased. The ‘Next’ and ‘Prev’
buttons are used to navigate through the entire list of candidate
compounds by loading the next or previous set of structures on
the TDW. While proceeding through results, compounds can be
tagged as ‘Viable’, ‘Deleted’ or ‘Purged’ and only compounds
with the speciﬁed tag(s) appear on the TDW. Two instances of
Chimera are shown per monitor on the left-most column of the TDW,
demonstrating the scalability of ViewDock TDW. This scalability also
allows for its use with a minimal setup of a two-computer network.
We have built and tested this scenario where up to six instances of
Chimera were run without noticeably impaired performance.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The manual, visual analysis step of the virtual screening-based, drug
discovery workﬂow is enhanced by ViewDock TDW. ViewDock TDW
scales to any display conﬁguration, is easily installed, and gives
the user global to ﬁne-grained control over the rendered structures.
Being able to compare, group, analyze and manipulate multiple
candidate ligands simultaneously gives the researcher a better tool to
effectively choose compounds to purchase for subsequent validation
studies. This increases the efﬁcacy and decreases the time involved
in drug discovery.

ViewDock TDW is written in perl, python and shell scripts.
It runs as a packaged, extension of UCSF Chimera, which can
be downloaded free of charge at http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.

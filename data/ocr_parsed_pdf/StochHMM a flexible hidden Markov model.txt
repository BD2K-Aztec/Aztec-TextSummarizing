"Stochastic decoding available with further code implementation. "I" indicates support for feature within the application. (Kulp et al, 1996; Lam and Meyer, 2009; Lunter,

2007; Sand et al, 2010; Schijtz and Delorenzi, 2008).

in the human genome (Ginno et al., 2012, 2013). In collaboration
with Diane Schroeder, we created a simple 2—state model, which
uses a unique alphabet based on percent methylation of CpG
sites, to classify high and partial methylation domains in
multiple Methyl—Seq datasets (Schroeder et al., 2011, 2013).
The StochHMM library was used to implement Ploidamatic, a
12—state HMM to identify copy—number variation using next—
generation whole genome sequence from a diploid organism
(Porter et al., submitted for publication). We are currently
using StochHMM to create gene prediction models that integrate
existing bioinformatics tools and additional data sources into the
HMM framework to improve gene prediction.

5 CONCLUSONS

StochHMM is a ﬂexible hidden Markov model program and
C++ library that gives researchers the ability to implement trad—
itional HMMs from a simple text file. The application provides
similar performance and features previously available only in
libraries, such as HMMoc. It provides multiple ways to integrate
additional dataset or user—defined functions into the HMM
framework. To encourage the use of StochHMM, we have set
up forums on Google Groups to assist researchers in develop—
ment of HMMs using StochHMM. We look forward to com—
ments, suggestions and future collaborative development of
StochHMM.

Abstract

Protein crosslinking has been used for decades to derive structural information about proteins and
protein complexes. Only recently, however, it became possible to map the amino acids involved in
the crosslinks with the advent of high resolution mass spectrometry (MS). Here, we present
Crossfinder, which automates the search for crosslinks formed by site—specifically incorporated

crosslinking amino acids in LC—MS—MS data.

Availability and Implementation: An executable version of Crossfinder for Windows machines
(64—bit) is freely available to non—commercial users. It is bundled with a manual and example data.

Introduction

For decades; protein crosslinking has been a widely used technique
to obtain information about the structural architecture of proteins
and protein complexes. The full potential of the technique however
was achieved only recently when it became technically feasible to
map the precise amino acids that are involved in the crosslink by
high accuracy mass spectrometry (MS) and dedicated bioinformatic
tools that mine the MS datasets. Applications include probing pro-
tein conformations, mapping interaction surfaces between proteins
and elucidating the structural architectures of protein complexes
(Chen et (11., 2010; Forne et (11., 2012; Herzog et (11., 2012; Sinz and
Wang, 2001).

Crosslinking can be induced for example by adding a chemical
with two reactive groups to a protein solution. The chemical will
then crosslink accessible amino acids. Several software solutions
exist to map these kinds of crosslinks from MS data.

Alternatively; the crosslinker can be site-specifically installed
into the protein; e.g. during chemical synthesis or by using genetic-
ally encoded crosslinking amino acids (Chin et (11., 2002). Site-
specifically attached crosslinkers have several advantages (see Forne
et (11., 2012; for discussion). Among them is the possibility to target
the crosslinker to specific regions of the protein. Through this

targeted approach; we could; e.g. validate a crystal interface in solu-
tion (Gazda et (11., 2013). Dedicated software tools to map crosslinks
formed by site-specifically installed crosslinkers are scarce; unfortu-
nately (Forne et (11., 2012; Gotze et (11., 2012).

To map such crosslinks; we previously developed a collection of
Matlab scripts (Forne et (11., 2012). Programming skills were needed
to use the scripts; however; limiting their practicality. Moreover; the
scripts lacked a convenient workflow; had no intuitive user inter-
face; and it was not possible to easily visualize and browse through
the results. Collectively; these issues limited wide-spread application
of crosslinking approaches in which the crosslinking moiety is site-
specifically incorporated into the protein. We introduce here an
easy-to-use executable version of Crossfinder that intuitively inte-
grates all steps of the analysis.

Description of crossfinder

Crossfinder’s scope is to map protein crosslinks formed between
site-specifically incorporated crosslinking moieties and other; un-
known amino acids in the same or a separate protein with amino
acid resolution. Any crosslinking moiety can be used as long as its
mass is known; and it forms crosslinks that are stable under MS con-
ditions. The amino acid sequences of the proteinls) that potentially

take part in the crosslinking reaction must be known before running
Crossfinder. These sequences can be readily determined by conven-
tional MS search engines. The number of proteins Crossfinder can
handle is only limited by the memory of the computer. Hundreds of
proteins pose no problem on conventional PCs.

Crossfinder accepts LC—MS-MS data in three commonly used
data formats: szML, MGF and DTA. Note that the charges of
precursor ions must have been measured. It is advisable to exclude
precursors with lower charge states during data collection as they
mostly come from linear, not from crosslinked peptides (Rinner
et al., 2008).

All information necessary to run Crossfinder is compiled in a
Microsoft Excel template file, which is directly opened by
Crossfinder. The Excel template allows for a convenient overview
over the settings.

A valuable feature of Crossfinder is its ability to perform the
crosslinking analysis on multiple datasets at once, e.g. on samples
and negative controls. Each dataset can consist of any number of
data files. For instance, it may be practical to combine files contain-
ing replicates into a single dataset for the purpose of the analysis.
Combining files into datasets drastically reduces the length and com-
plexity of the output and thus significantly speeds up the down-
stream analysis. At the end of the analysis, the results obtained for
individual datasets can also be filtered against one another, further
simplifying the complexity of the output (see below).

Based on protein sequences, protease information, variable and
constant modifications of amino acids and the mass and position of
the crosslink-inducing amino acid, Crossfinder compiles a list of all
theoretically possible peptides (Fig. 1). Any of these peptides may in
principle be part of a crosslink. Crossfinder simulates crosslinking in
silico by combining the peptides bearing the crosslinking moiety
with all other possible peptides. Side reactions introduced by the
crosslinking moiety, such as intra-peptide crosslinking or—in the
case of benzophenones—abstraction of two hydrogen atoms from
the target peptide (Dorman and Prestwich, 1994), are similarly
simulated. Each theoretically possible peptide, crosslinked or not, is
a candidate that Crossfinder will try to identify in the experimental
data (Fig. 1).

Depending on the specificity of the crosslinking moiety, multiple
amino acids within one peptide may be the target of the crosslinking
reaction. Each possible position is considered, creating a family of
isobaric crosslink candidates. Crossfinder later determines which of
these candidates best explains the data to obtain the attachment site
with amino acid resolution.

Crossfinder assigns candidates to spectra by letting all candidates,
including uncrosslinked ones, compete for any given spectrum. If mul-
tiple candidates can be assigned to one spectrum, a calculated score is
used to rank the matches (Forne et al., 2012). A cutoff relative to the
score of the best match can be freely chosen to display only a fraction
of the possible matches and reduce the complexity of the output
(Supplementary Fig. 51A). Internal ions, i.e. ions that are produced by
double fragmentation of the peptide backbone, provide additional
support for correct identification (Supplementary Fig. 513) and can
help to distinguish between candidates with ambiguous scores.

Precursor and fragment masses are matched within a specified
experimental error. Precise error limits for both MS dimensions may
not be known the first time the data are analyzed, however.
Crossfinder can help the user to determine the error limits first.
Errors can be specified in ppm or absolute masses. We note that
crosslinks can be assigned with a much higher confidence if actual
errors are in the ppm range in both MS dimensions. Indeed,
Crossfinder is optimized to work with high accuracy MS-MS data.

The results of the analysis are saved as text files that can be dir-
ectly imported into Excel. In addition, the user can conveniently
browse through the annotated spectra in the graphical user interface
(Supplementary Fig 51A).

Crossfinder provides the opportunity to re-filter the data after the
analysis. For example, a dataset can be filtered against another one by
retaining only those candidates that are present in or absent from the
second dataset. The data can also be filtered for candidates that could
explain at least a certain fraction of the total ion intensity in the MS-MS
spectrum, that achieved a certain minimal score or that contained a
sufficient number of matched fragment ions of various sorts
(Supplementary Fig. 51A). More detailed explanations of the filters are
provided in the manual. The re-filtered data can be saved or exported as
a comma separated text file that can be directly opened by Excel.

Supplementary Figure 1 shows an example analysis of previously
published and additional unpublished data. As expected, all previ-
ously identified crosslinks could be readily mapped.

In conclusion, Crossfinder streamlines the identification of cross-
links formed by site-specifically incorporated crosslinkers. It offers
an intuitive interface, allows for sophisticated filtering, displays the
data in a compact and organized fashion and readily exports the
results to Excel for further downstream analyses.

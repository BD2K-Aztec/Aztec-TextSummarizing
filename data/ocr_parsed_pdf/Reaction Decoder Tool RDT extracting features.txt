Abstract

Summary: Extracting chemical features like Atom—Atom Mapping (AAM), Bond Changes (BCs) and
Reaction Centres from biochemical reactions helps us understand the chemical composition of en—
zymatic reactions. Reaction Decoder is a robust command line tool, which performs this task with
high accuracy. It supports standard chemical input/output exchange formats i.e. RXN/SMILES,
computes AAM, highlights BCs and creates images of the mapped reaction. This aids in the ana—
lysis of metabolic pathways and the ability to perform comparative studies of chemical reactions
based on these features.

Availability and implementation: This software is implemented in Java, supported on Windows,
Linux and Mac OSX, and freely available at https://github.com/asad/ReactionDecoder

Large—scale chemical reaction databases such as KEGG (Kanehisa
et (11., 2013), BRENDA (Chang et (11., 2015), Rhea (Alcantara et (11.,
2012) and MetaCyc (Latendresse et (11., 2012) link reactions to en—
zymes and provide data—mining opportunities for novel pathways
(Hatzimanikatis et (11., 2004; Rahman, 2007), and the discovery of
drugs, natural products and green chemistry. One of the primary
bottlenecks for automated analyses of these chemical reactions
comes from the realizations of the imperfect quality of data, such as
unmapped or unbalanced reactions. Accurate Atom—Atom Mapping
(AAM)—the one—to—one correspondence between the substrate and
product atoms (Gasteiger, 2003), will lead to correct prediction of

the fate of interesting atoms or substructure across metabolic net—
works (Faulon and Bender, 2010) etc. Linking novel pathways or
optimizing pathways of biological/commercial relevance demands
better understanding of metabolic routes (Rahman, 2007) and path—
way annotation (May et (11., 2013).

We present Reaction Decoder Tool (RDT), a robust open source
software for mining reaction features, i.e. BCs, reaction centres and
to calculate similarity between reactions etc. The algorithm and
competing tools have been published in our previous article
(Rahman et (11., 2014). Here we present the source code with rele—
vant changes and below mentioned features.

2 Features

BCs in chemical reactions refers to the cleavage and formation of
chemical bonds, changes in bond order and stereo changes, which are
due to chemical processes such as chiral inversions or cis—trans isomer—
izati0n(s). In the chemical reaction diagram and tables atoms are con—
nected by a bond i.e. single ‘—‘, double ‘:’or ring ‘%’ etc. (Fig. 1a),
for instance C—C means a single carbon—carbon bond that is cleaved
(‘I’) or formed in the reaction (‘II’). Bond order changes are repre—
sented by star ""’, e.g. C—C ’5 C = C means a single carbon—carbon
bond turning into double carbon—carbon bond or vice versa. Stereo
changes are represented as atoms that change their absolute configur—
ation, for instance C(R/S) means a carbon atom that changes from R
to S configuration. A reaction centre is the collection of atoms and
bonds that are changed during the reaction (Warr, 2014), also known
as the local atomic environment around the atoms involved in BCs.
The key features of this tool are:

i. Ability to perform AAM on chemical reactions catalyzed by en—
zymes (Fig. 1).

ii. In a balanced reaction, the total number of atoms on the left
side of the equation (Reactant), equals the total number of
atoms on the right (Product). In unbalanced reactions a best
‘guess’ is made.

iii. Generates images of the mapped reactions where matching sub—
structures are highlighted.

iv. Generates reaction patterns and BCs for input reactions.

v. The input format and resulting mapped reaction with AAM in—
formation can be SMILES or RXN ﬁle (Gasteiger, 2003).

vi. The SMSD (Rahman et al., 2009) and CDK (Steinbeck et al.,
2006) are used to process chemical information.

3 Usage and applications

Tools like EC—Blast (Rahman et al., 2014), FunTree (Sillitoe and
Furnham, 2016), MACiE (Holliday et al., 2012) etc. use RDT in the

background to mine and extract chemical information from thou—
sands of enzyme reactions. The success rate of mapping is >99%
when compared with manual AAM mappings (Rahman et al.,
2014). Originally developed to explore enzyme reactions, the tool is
also useful to explore any kind of organic chemical reaction
(Martinez Cuesta et al., 2014).

4 Conclusion

Reaction Decoder is a robust tool to compute AAM and extract
chemical features and calculate similarity between chemical reac—
tions. This is coded in java and optimized to run as a computation—
ally asynchronous process. It is distributed under GNU—GPL V3
license.

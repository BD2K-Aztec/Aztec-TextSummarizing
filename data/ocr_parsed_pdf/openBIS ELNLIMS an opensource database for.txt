Abstract

Summary: The open—source platform openBIS (open Biology Information System) offers an
Electronic Laboratory Notebook and a Laboratory Information Management System (ELN—LIMS)
solution suitable for the academic life science laboratories. openBIS ELN—LIMS allows researchers
to efficiently document their work, to describe materials and methods and to collect raw and ana—
lyzed data. The system comes with a user—friendly web interface where data can be added, edited,

browsed a nd searched.

Availability and implementation: The openBIS software, a user guide and a demo instance are
available at https://0penbis—eln—Iims.ethz.ch. The demo instance contains some data from our Ia—
boratory as an example to demonstrate the possibilities of the ELN—LIMS (Ottoz et al., 2014). For
rapid local testing, a VirtualBox image 0fthe ELN—LIMS is also available.

1 Introduction

Scientific recording is an essential part of research, as progress in science
depends among other factors on existing knowledge and reproducibility.
Recording is the process by which the scientific question, the choice of
an experimental procedure, materials and methods, data analysis and in-
terpretation of the results are gathered. Traditionally, all these details
were kept in paper notebooks.

In today’s academic life science laboratories, most raw data,
analyzed data and scripts are stored electronically, while the experi-
mental details are often recorded in paper notebooks. This makes
linking and retrieving experimental details and results problematic.
Moreover, the large amount of data produced by today’s readout
machines adds a level of complexity as the devices the data are
stored on might soon be outdated.

Databases represent a solution to store all the necessary informa-
tion together (Bird et al., 2013) because (i) they ensure long-lasting

data storage by being independent of the operating environment; (ii)
they are installed on a dedicated server, enabling long-term data
storage and regular backups; (iii) they allow storage of large
amounts of data; (iv) they are easily accessible via a local area net-
work or the Internet; (v) custom applications can be easily added.
Several commercial database solutions for ELNs are available, but
they are not commonly adopted by academia. An internal evaluation
among the research groups of the departments of Biosystems Science
and Engineering and Biology of ETH Zurich found that the options
affordable to academic labs had either unsuitable user interfaces (U1)
or lack of features. The combination of an easy-to-use UI, flexible
adaptation to a labs needs, support of an audit trail, physical support
of the data server, support for managing large amounts of data and
for integrating new measurement devices was only available at very
high costs. On the other hand, the available open-source platforms
lack many of the above features and, as they often originate from a

Experiment. For example, we sort the western blotting and the PCR
Samples into the western blotting Experiment and the PCR
Experiment.

2.3 ELN

In the ELN, experimental data are stored and described in a scientif—
ically meaningful manner, in terms of goal, method and interpret—
ation of the results.

Each user has a personal Data Space where he/she can create and
edit Projects, Experiments and Samples (Fig. 2, right side). An
Experiment is a specific scientific question and contains Samples
that are individual attempts to answer it. For example, to monitor
the expression of gene x, we performed real—time quantitative PCR
(RT—qPCR) and western blotting. In the database, we create an
Experiment called Gene >< expression and two Samples describing
the results obtained by RT—qPCR and western blotting. All materials
and methods used for each Sample are conveniently linked and can
be annotated with specific details (e.g. deviation from the protocol).
This ensures a complete description of the experiments and easy
back—tracking (Fig. 3). The results of the RT—qPCR and the western
blot can then be uploaded as Datasets to the corresponding
Samples. Importantly, the information about configurations or set—
up of the acquisition machines are stored in the Datasets as their set—
tings are specific to this result. In our example, the raw data, the
analyzed data and the analysis scripts are organized as separate
Datasets.

2.4 Interaction with the system

An essential aspect of a database is its ease—of—use. We implemented
an intuitive and easy user interface (ELN—U1) for the structure
described above. This interface can be used on desktops and other
devices, such as tablets. The ELN—U1 main menu accesses the ELN,
the LIMS, the Utilities (containing a storage manager), a generic
search function and a BLAST search function (Altschul et al., 1990).
Samples of the same type are listed in tables whose columns can be
filtered with keywords. Single Samples can be selected to be visual—
ized or printed separately. Connections between Samples can be in—
spected and browsed via a tree—like visualization.

We enter new Samples by filling in a form in the ELN—U1 or via
batch upload of text files. Data are uploaded as Datasets, either via
the ELN—U1 or via “dropbox scripts”. These are written in Java or
Jython and automatically register data and metadata, which can be
directly imported from a data acquisition machine, like a micro—
scope. Export of metadata and data is done with an export function
from the ELN—U1 or using dedicated scripts.

To set up the system, an administrator has to operate the previ—
ously described standard openBIS interface (Bauch et al., 2011).
This interface is needed for configuration of the underlying data—
base, as Data Spaces, Experiment, Sample and Dataset types and

properties are created and maintained from there. However, normal
users of the ELN—LIMS do not need to familiarize themselves with
this interface as the ELN—U1 possesses all necessary possibilities for
everyday lab work and data retrieval.

3 Conclusion

We described an efficient ELN—LIMS based on the open source plat—
form openBIS. This platform is pre—set with sensible defaults and
ready for use. It can be customized and extended, as shown by the
integration of PlasMapper and BLAST. Further extensions could be
the integration of a function generating reports or the seamless inte—
gration of previously described openBIS extensions (Bauch et al.,
2011).

Initial use of a database requires a time investment to organize
the existing data, a learning phase and some security precautions.
Nevertheless, we find that openBIS ELN—LIMS is of great help and
worth the effort. Having all data stored in a single place and easily
accessible sped up work and facilitated data retrieval in our
laboratory.

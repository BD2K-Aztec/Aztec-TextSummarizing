Network inference from fitness data

 

using latest technological advances to massively scale the trad—
itional gene deletion/interruption studies in order to achieve
nearly genome—wide coverage by generating knockout/knock—
down mutant strain libraries for all non—essential genes in an
organism (Oh et al., 2010). These libraries are then further sub—
jected to a large number of environmental conditions and stres—
sesiwith the observable in each of the settings being the ﬁtness
of individual clones (collected in stationary phase). Pairing the
resulting data with an appropriate model of gene expression then
allows for the inference of the underlying gene regulatory net—
works through estimation of signiﬁcant interaction terms, along
with those for production, degradation, expression level, etc.
Although potentially applicable to any observable type, this ap—
proach may be particularly well—suited for the use with ﬁtness
data to help constrain any inferred gene regulatory network so—
lutions to those dynamic modes that are most important for a
given set of biological functions and conditions%. g. growth on
speciﬁc substrates or tolerance to certain stresses. Recent works
have indeed suggested that the use of genome—wide ﬁtness data
can provide new perspectives on systems—level organization of
cells and uncover novel gene regulatory interactions when com—
pared with gene expression—based analysis (Hillenmeyer et al.,
2008, 2010); Deutschbauer et al., 2011). Yet, although on a lim—
ited scale the idea of biological network characterization based
on knockout data has been considered before, e. g. Winzeler et a].
(1999), the emergence of high—throughput genome—wide gene
deletion/interruption technology along with the use of popula—
tion fitness rather than gene expression as an observable offers
novel challenges as well as beneﬁts to the task of gene network
inference. On the one hand, microarray and other gene expres—
sion experiments typically generate high—dimensional data in the
form of a real vector that comprises expression levels of multiple
genes at each sampled time and/or condition point, whereas ﬁt—
ness measurements map the state of the system into a much
lower dimensional space%.g. that of a single real variable,
such as growth rate. This inevitably leads to signiﬁcant loss of
information. On the other hand, deletion experiments usually
involve simply cultivating and observing cells, which could be
performed on a substantially larger scale, much more efﬁciently
and under signiﬁcantly greater range of conditions when com—
pared with the relatively demanding gene expression assays. The
ensuing ability to perform experiments simultaneously across the
entire mutant collection substantially increases the overall
genome—wide ﬁtness data dimensionalitwaten putting it on
par with available gene expression datasets. Furthermore, ﬁtness
observations allow for the preferential selection or overweighting
of clones that display a desirable phenotype, e. g. the stronger the
selectionithe more significant the contribution of surviving
strains. This becomes an increasingly important factor in many
biotechnological and biomedical applications, whereby the con—
tribution of practically irrelevant genes is effectively being ﬁltered
outiregardless of their statistical signiﬁcance or dynamic state.
Indeed, it has been shown that this type of data is very useful for
the determination of target gene functions (Deutschbauer et al.,
2002, 2011; Hillenmeyer et al., 2010; Pierce et al., 2009; Steinmetz
et al., 2002).

Few systematic models and/or inference algorithms have
been proposed for the elucidation of regulatory networks from
ﬁtness data. Conclusions are often being made on the basis of

visual inspections or similar relatively naive strategies. Yet,
greater prominence and availability of such data along with in—
dications that ﬁtness proﬁling might contain information about
gene regulation suggest the need for a more comprehensive and
rigorous inference approach. The analysis of ample data pro—
vided by genome—wide ﬁtness experiments may also be useful
in complementing network inference methods based on micro—
array gene expression and such other data by helping to initialize
them or further refine their results.

In this work, we propose an algorithm for inferring gene regu—
latory networks from genome—wide knockout ﬁtness data. Our
approach is based on describing biological networks via a
non—linear dynamical model and then elucidating model param—
eters from fitness measurements. The resulting parameter set can
be used to identify the underlying regulatory network structure
as well as to make forward—looking estimates of its function
under temporal dynamics or environmental changes. In Section
2, we describe the system model and problem formulation. In
Section 2.2, we provide a heuristic sample ordering selection al—
gorithm based on correlation score to cope with the order selec—
tion problem that arises when using mutant ﬁtness data. In
Section 3, we describe the parameter estimation algorithm
based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) technique. In
Section 4, we use the proposed algorithm to analyse both a syn—
thetic example as well as experimental data from yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bacteria Shewanella oneidensis,
which are further compared against known empirical results.
We conclude the article with a summary and remarks regarding
the proposed model and inference algorithm.

2 SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM
FORMULATION

2.1 System model

The outline of our approach is to describe a gene expression data
model and to then extend it towards accommodating the observ—
ables supplied in the form of a large—scale knockout strain fitness
dataset. To this end, we ﬁrst introduce a basic model of gene
expression as a weighted sum of (non—linear) functions of other
genes with additive noise. We then obtain, through the removal
of individual genes, the knockout strain network models used to
drive the observed ﬁtness model, which thus contains latent vari—
ables of our overall model, as described next in further detail.

Consider a gene regulatory network with total N genes. Let
g,(k), i: 1, ...,N, k = 1,2, ...,M denote the gene expression
level for the i—th gene at time k. We denote observation or meas—
urement data, x,~(k), for g,(k) at time k as:

x,~(k) = g,(k) + v,~(k), (1)

where v,~(k) is the observation noise at time k for i—th gene. (Note
that here the term ‘time’ is used in the generalized Bayesian in—
ference sense and so may be loosely viewed as a discrete index
enumerating individual experimentsirather than some continu—
ous parameter of a kinetic biochemical system. Accordingly, the
dynamic model we use is one based on ‘discrete time’, which thus
fundamentally does not a priori assume or require continuity of
states or observables.) We denote gene expression levels
within the network by vector g(k) = [g1(k), . . . , gN(k)]T, the

observation vector by x(k) = [x1(k), . . . , xN(k)]T and noise
vector by v(k) = [v1(k), . . . , vN(k)]T. We assume that all vectors
v(k) for k = 1, . . . , M are independent and jointly Gaussian with
zero mean and variance matrix R(k). We approximate any multi—
variate geneigene interactions by a combination of a linear ex—
pansion around the stationary solution and univariate non—linear
terms. Speciﬁcally, we follow a discrete—time regulation model
proposed in (Chen and Aihara, 1997) and describe the regulatory
functions among genes as:

N N
grk + 1) = Ear/g/(k) + megrkx m) + I. + we), (2)
/=1 /=1

for i: 1, ...,N, where a” denotes the linear regulation coefﬁ—
cient from genej to gene 1' and A 2 [a11, ...,aNN]T; 1);; denotes
the non—linear regulation coefﬁcient from gene j to gene 1' and
B = [b11,b12, ...,bNN]T;f,« is the non—linear function for genej
which is given by:

where M} is the parameter to be inferred and [L = [[21, . . . , MN
1, denotes the system expression bias for i—th gene and
I = [11, ...,IN]T, which will be inferred later. The noise vectors
w(k) 2 mac), ...,wN(k)]T for k = 1,2, ...,M are assumed to
be jointly Gaussian with zero mean and variance Q(k). We also
assume that they are independent from all V(k). The regulatory
network is realized as a stateispace model, where we view gene
expression levels as states and measurements as observations.
The goal of inference is to estimate all the unknown parameters
in the model. Inference results then provide estimates for all
regulatory relations across the network.

Note that Equations (1) and (2) provide the description of the
system in a manner most commensurate with expression data. We
now proceed to extend this model to accommodate ﬁtness data.
Without loss of generality, we consider the case of a mutant library
with single gene knockout per strain (with multiple—knockout col—
lections being handled analogously, as discussed later) and assume
that jk—th gene has been deleted when the system is at time k. Note
that ‘time’ here corresponds to the experiment number, with the
index jk being determined as discussed in the previous paragraph.
For the purposes of the single—knockout stateispace model, ex—
pressions of all genes evolve without participation of gene jk.
Therefore we set all jk regulatory coefficients to zero. The states
and system coefficients equations can then be summarized as:

Mk +1): Mk); Mk +1): IMO?) Vi,
air/11k) = 0; I’m/III?) = 0 Vi,
“Ix/(k + 1) = urn/(k), if} #jk,
[Wu/(k + 1) = bin/(k), if] #jk,

N N (4)
grk + 1) = Z arm/(k) + Z blame/(k), m)
./=1 ./=1
‘1’],~ + 114(k),   
gill + 1) : gill

The last two equations determine the current system coefﬁ—
cients, which will be appended to the system state. Unlike the
case of expression microarrays, here, each gene deletion/interrup—
tion strain measurement quantiﬁes a single system property

which is a function of all the remaining genes. In this article,
we assume this measurement is a real number, which represents
the fitness of the remaining network. (The model can be easily
adapted into higher dimensional measurement case by direct ex—
tension.) Therefore, the observation x(k) becomes:

XUC) =ﬂg1(k), ---,gN(k)) + V06), (5)

where f: IRN —> IR is typically not known a priori. We denote
R(k) as the variance of V(k) as before.

Various bases could be used to estimate f and associated co—
efﬁcients. For instance, one could use a simple basis such as
power seriesiie. a Taylor expansion. However, the speed of
convergence for Taylor expansion is slow, resulting in a large
number of parameters to be estimated. In contrast, the radial
basis approach has been shown to be more robust and adaptive
than Taylor expansion (Jiang et al., 2003). Furthermore, it has
been shown that with certain additional assumptions, the ap—
proximation by radial basis will converge to the true function
in Lp sense (Powell, 1987). Thus, we approximate f as:

[7
ﬂy) e ZA;¢(IIy—yfll) HOTy, (6)
./=1

where M for i = 1, . . . , p and Ag are the centres of the basis with
A = [20121, ...,Ap]T; p is the total number of basis functions
used, which is a fixed constant; y}, i,j = 1, ...,p are the centre
points of the waveform, which are chosen a priori; and
<I>(x) :2 v c + xzithe Hardy multi—quadratic function with con—
stant c>0, which serves as a classical choice for efﬁcient radial
basis expansion (Buhmann, 2003).

All the coefficients 2,, i = 1, . . . , p as well as Ag are parameters
to be inferred and so are appended to the state variable.
Therefore, the new augmented model state variable for knockout
fitness data is:

yac) = [gm AT, BT, IT, If, “1’ (7)

As a summary, the dynamical model we propose for regulatory
networks with gene deletion/interruption mutant fitness data is:

y(k + 1) = Fk(Y(k)) + W(k) (8)

WC) ZﬂIkY(k)) + V06),

where Fk(-) is the system function described in (4);
W(k) = [wl, ..., wN,0, ...,0] is the augmented noise vector; [k
is the selection matrix, i.e. Iky = [g1, ...,g/_,1,0,g/_+1, ...,gN]T
where the index at is determined by the time index k; V(k) is the
Gaussian noise as assumed before.

2.2 Data feeding order score

To infer the model given in (8), one needs to specify the order in
which data are supplied to the algorithm. The question in what
order data should be optimally fed into the inference algorithm
thus arises. As this problem is fundamentally associated with the
network structure itself, it can be solved exactly only if the struc—
ture of the network is already known. (And even then, the prob—
lem typically has NP—hard complexity since one needs to test all
possible permutations.) Since the feeding order will have direct
impact on the performance of the inference result, we still need a

Network inference from fitness data

 

strategy to find an ‘optimal’ feeding order without explicitly
exploring all potential network structures. In this section, we
propose a heuristic strategy based on correlation score, which
is then compared against selecting the feeding order randomly
and shown to be more ‘optimal’ by offering certain advantages.
The basic idea behind the proposed heuristic is that we should
feed the most usede data ﬁrst. In this work, we use correlation as
a measure of such ‘usefulness’. The intuition is that for sequential
inference of the model (8), the data should be fed based on their
importance in a certain sense. The reasoning for this strategy is
that, in sequential inference, a good starting point usually pro—
vides a superior opportunity to converge to a good result and
vice versa. Moreover, once we have already fallen into a steady
state or an attracting basin, subsequent data may have less in—
ﬂuence on the ﬁnal result, since it may be difﬁcult to jump away
from the local attractor. By contrast, at early stages, this inﬂu—
ence may be vital to the ﬁnal inference result. Heuristically, the
importance of a certain sample may be determined by the con—
nectivity of the deleted gene. If it has many connections to other
genes, it may likely play an important role in the network, which
would be reﬂected in the measurement value (e. g. fitness). Based
on this approach, the feeding order for a sample is related to the
importance or connectivity of the corresponding deleted gene,
which could be quantified by using correlation as a metric.
Speciﬁcally, we consider fitness observations x(k),
k = 1, 2, . . . , M = L - N, where L is a positive integer represent—
ing the total rounds of experiments. Note that without loss of

generality, we can always assume that x(lN + i), I: 0, ...,L,
i: 1, ...,N is the [+1 round fitness data for gene 1'. The
score S(n) for gene 11 = 1, ...,N is calculated as:
L71 N
S(n) = Z Z x(lN+n)x(i), (9)
[=0 i=l;i7’:n

with gene feeding arranged in the order of descending |S(n)|. The
summation over i calculates the correlation under round I. The
ﬁnal score is the summation over all rounds. This approach may
be compared with choosing the feeding order randomly, as will
be done later using concrete examples.

Finally, note that a similar feeding heuristic may be used to
optimize the order of individual experimental conditions as well.
The utility of this additional step, however, needs to be weight
against the diminished significance of individual permutations
among observation data points as the number of conditions be—
comes large as well as the increasing computational overhead this
may entail. As in our applications the number of conditions was
substantially greater than either the number of genes or the
number of connections between them, we found the additional
computational costs such extra step would entail to be
unwarranted.

3 THE UNSCENTED KALMAN FILTER APPROACH
FOR INFERENCE

In the previous section, we proposed a system model for describ—
ing gene regulatory networks at the stateispace level. The ap—
proach now requires an algorithm for estimating the unknown
parameters of the model, from which network organization
and other biological system properties may be inferred. Here, a

Kalman filter techniqueia well—characterized estimation strat—
egy for elucidating state—space models of regulatory networks
(Wang et al., 2006, 2009), and speciﬁcally, an unscented
Kalman filter (UKF%is used to accomplish this task. UKF is
used to estimate all the parameters in order to cope with the
expected non—linearity of the model (Julier and Uhlmann,
1997), as it has been shown to have superior performance
when compared with traditional approaches, such as the ex—
tended Kalman filter, especially with availability of enough data.

Classical Kalman ﬁlter technique iteratively uses innovations
in state and measurement predictionsiupdating the system se—
quentially (Simon, 2006). The general idea of a Kalman ﬁlter can
be summarized as:

Estimation of states 2 (prediction for state) 10
+ lC(k)(residue of prediction for measurement), ( )
where [C(k) is the ‘gain’ for the residue. The original approach by
Kalman is based on linear differential equation model under
Gaussian noise assumption. An extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF)
has been proposed for dealing with non—linear models
(Corigliano and Mariani, 2004). The idea of EKF is to linearize
the non—linear function by approximating it with the ﬁrst—order
Taylor expansion. However, such an approximation is quite
coarse and insufﬁcient under general circumstances. Some
approaches look to remedying the situation by using
higher—order terms Taylor expansion terms, whichiwhile more
accurateigenerally leads to dramatic increases in complexity
(Daum, 2005). Alternatively, UKF approximates the non—linear
function by viewing it as a non—linear transform and then using
the so—called ‘sigma points’ to capture the posterior mean and
covariance accurately up to the third order. Compared with
EKF, UKF provides a more accurate approximation without
signiﬁcant increase in complexity and has been shown superior
in many practical situations (Wan and Van Der Merwe, 2000).
Another advantage of UKF is that it does not require the cal—
culation of model’s Jacobian or Hessian, which makes the algo—
rithm and associated mathematical derivations less involved (see
more below).

As noted, the UKF is based on the idea of choosing sigma
points from the unscented transform. Consider a random vector
x being passed through a non—linear transform y = h(x). In order
to calculate the mean and variance of y, we choose the Sigma
points 8,, i = 0, . . . , 2R and their weights Wi as follows:

80 : E(x))

Si 2 E(x) + (x/(L+)L)Var(x)),~ i: 1, ...,R,
Si 2 E(x) — (w/(L+)L)Var(x)),~,R i: R+ 1, ...,2R,

where Var(x) is the variance matrix of the random variable x; (-),
denotes the i—th column of the input matrix; A = a2(R + K) — R
is the scaling parameter; and ﬂ is a parameter incorporating prior

Network inference from fitness data

 

Although ﬁtness data inherently suffers from loss of informa—
tion caused by its reduced dimensionality, when compared with
the more widely explored gene expression data type, the poten—
tially larger amounts of and more contextually/phenotypically
meaningful data provided may be able to compensate for the
relative lack of resolution as our work appears to suggest. The
analysis of a synthetic example as well as empirical GAL and
T yrRiLiuR network data presented here shows that the
described algorithm is able to provide satisfying inference results
even for relatively complex mechanisms.

Ultimately, the two data typesigene expression and knockout
ﬁtnessimay be expected to be most informative when used in a
complementary fashion. As noted previously, inferences gener—
ated from genome—wide knockout ﬁtness data could be used to
facilitate network elucidation methods based on gene expression
by helping initialize or further refine their predictions.
Conversely, information provided by gene expression data may
be exploited by the proposed algorithm in conjunction with
knockout fitness data to synergistically improve ﬁnal inference
results. For instance, gene expression data may be collected
under a more limited set of conditions, for a subset of the
mutant library, or just for the wild—type strain; and used for
the initial inference of an augmented state vector
y(k) = [gT(k),AT,BT,IT, MT]Tiassociated only with the gene
expression part of the model, Equations (1}(4). Such prelimin—
ary results could then be used as a prior for the subsequent net—
work inference round, which uses genome—wide ﬁtness data in
order to take advantage of its potentially larger scale or more
immediate availability across a range of conditions, as well as to
introduce corresponding phenotypically significant refinements
(as discussed earlier).

Several other directions appear promising toward potentially
further extending and improving the inference methodology pro—
posed here. For instance, the non—linear univariate interaction
model, Equation (2), may be augmented with explicitly multi—
variate terms. This should serve to enhance resolution of
non—linear interactions for a given gene across multiple reaction
partners and improve modelling accuracy, though at a cost of
substantial computational overhead owing to complications
related to multiplicative noise propagation and the need to ac—
count for intermediate molecular complexes. Perhaps a more
straightforward approach involves using the model to accommo—
date multiple—knockout experiments (i.e. those involving multiple
inactivated genes in each strain). This is done analogously to the
way single—knockout networks have been analyzed here by
simply setting all of the corresponding interaction term coefﬁ—
cients to zero for the genes in question. The reason we have
focused less on such applications in this work, however, is the
present scarcity of multiple— versus single—knockout observation
data. Finally, additional constraints could be incorporated to
help account for other pre—existing sources of experimental or
heuristic information. For example, we have noted earlier the
possibility of applying feed optimization schemes to condition
data ordering. One may further look at various sparseness con—
ditions as a way of improving computational efﬁciency and
incorporating pre—existing knowledge about the network during
inference. [Though, care should be taken, as signiﬁcant vari—
ations in effective regulatory network topology may naturally
arise across experimental conditions or in going from one related

organism to another (Bergmann et al, 2003; Luscombe et al,
2004)]

Overall, we believe that these questions help further support
the suggestion that the analysis of genome—wide fitness data
(whether directly or in conjunction with gene expression data)
towards understanding of biological systems function and, in
particular, inference of gene regulatory network organization
offers a rich new area of future researchito which this article
is seeking to make an initial contribution.

Abstract

Summary: Genome—wide association study (GWAS) of a biomarker is complicated when the assay
procedure of the biomarker is restricted by a Limit of Detection (LOD). Those observations falling
outside the LCD cannot be simply discarded, but should be included into the analysis by applying
an appropriate statistical method. However, the problem of LCD in GWAS analysis of such
biomarkers is usually overlooked. 'IodGWAS’ is a flexible, easy—to—use R package that provides a
simple and elegant way for GWAS analysis of such biomarkers while simultaneously accommodat—
ing the problem of LCD by applying a parametric survival analysis method.

1 Introduction

Genome—wide association study (GWAS) of a biomarker such as
immunoproteins (e.g. C—reactive protein), cytokines (e.g. interleukins)
and hormones (e.g. testosterone) is complicated if the detection range
of the biomarker is restricted by the assay procedure. So far GWAS
analyses of such biomarkers inadequately dealt with the problem of
the limit of detection. As a consequence, the identified associations
might be biased. The limit of detection (LCD) is the smallest or largest
concentration of a biomarker that can be reliably measured by the ana—
lytical procedure. Those measurements falling outside the LCD, so—
called non—detects (NDs), cannot be considered as missing values since
they do provide information about the distribution of the biomarker.
Simple exclusion of NDs from the statistical analysis will therefore
yield incorrect estimates. A number of statistical approaches have been
proposed to deal with the problem of LCD while still including those
NDs in the statistical analysis, such as: analyzing detect/non—detect

dichotomies, substituting NDs with a constant smaller than or equal to
the lower LCD, or substituting NDs with a random value between
zero and lower LOD (Uh et (11., 2008). However these methods insuffi—
ciently account for the available information provided by NDs, par—
ticularly when NDs comprise a large proportion of the data.

Recently Dinse and colleagues proposed to apply survival ana—
lysis to overcome the problem of LCD (Dinse et (11., 2014). They
stated that NDs can be viewed as censored data, as they are known
to fall within a certain interval. More details on this can be found in
the Supplementary data. This approach could also be applied to
GWAS data. However, currently available software packages for
GWAS analysis are not ﬂexible enough to properly account for
NDs. We developed ‘lodGWAS’, a ﬂexible, easy—to—use software
package that is capable of performing GWAS analysis of biomarkers
while accommodating the problem of LCD by applying survival
analysis in which NDs are treated as censored data.

2 Approach

2.1 Implementation

lodGWAS is built as a package for R (R Core Team, 2014). The R
platform was chosen as it is operating system—independent, com—
monly used, open source, and can handle large datasets. lodGWAS
depends upon the ‘survival’ R package (Therneau, 2000). It appro—
priately treats NDs as censored data, and performs a genome—wide
parametric survival analysis by including both ‘measured’ and ‘cen—
sored’ values. In this way, it allows full use of the available data.

2.2 Usage

The lodGWAS package provides two functions: the first enables the
user to check the quality of the input data, and the second to per—
form a genome—wide censored survival analysis.

GWAS analysis is prone to errors in the input files. Therefore we
emphasize the need for a thorough quality control of the input files,
and in particular, the phenotype file. The function ‘lod_QC’ checks
if the phenotype values within or outside LOD are coded correctly,
provides a number of descriptive statistics about the phenotype cod—
ing, and generates warning messages on suspected problems. The
main function is ‘lod_GWAS’, which enables the user to perform a
GWAS using survival analysis for censored data.

3 Results

3.1 Features

lodGWAS provides a number of options allowing for a ﬂexible and
user—customized GWAS analysis. It can handle NDs resulting from
both lower and upper LODs (left— and right—censored data, respect—
ively), as well as multiple lower and/or upper LOD levels (as in the case
of multiple assay types). Additionally, the user can adjust the analysis
for covariates, and specify the assumed distribution of the phenotype.

The genomic data, either genotyped and/or imputed, should be
provided in dosage format, which contains more information than
the best—guess genotype format. lodGWAS is capable of handling all
three commonly used dosage formats, as it will automatically recog—
nize whether there is one (dosage), two (two—probabilities) or three
(three—probabilities) columns of data per individual.

The output data will be optionally saved in a compressed or
uncompressed file. lodGWAS supports a variety of output file formats,
ensuring compatibility with different downstream software packages,
like we implemented in QCGWAS (van der Most et (11., 2014).

3.2 Example application in real human samples

As an example application of lodGWAS, we performed four GWAS
analyses on serum levels of C—reactive protein (CRP) in the LifeLines
cohort study (Scholtens et (11., 2014). CRP levels as well as GWAS
data were available for 12 838 healthy individuals (see supplemen
tary information for more details). Measurements of CRP were not
restricted by lower or upper LOD, yielding a complete dataset. We
analyzed the data with both PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007), considered
as gold standard, and lodGWAS. To demonstrate the robustness of
the results of lodGWAS, we also performed a second set of analyses
using an arbitrary lower LOD of 1.0 mg/L, which is equal to the
LOD of some older CRP assays. In this way, CRP values less than
this assumed LOD, i.e. 39% of the whole sample size, were dis—
carded by PLINK, and were considered as left—censored by
lodGWAS (Table 1). Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1 show
that GWAS results of analyses by PLINK and lodGWAS on the com—
plete dataset were identical. The PLINK analysis that discarded

39% of data below LOD yielded biased results that only modestly
correlated with the gold standard (Pearson’s correlation of estimated
effect sizes: 17; : 0.58; Pearson’s correlation of —log10(P—value): rp :
0.32). Moreover, the highly significant peaks that were observed on
chromosomes 1, 12 and 19 completely disappeared in this analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The results of the lodGWAS analysis ac—
counting for 39% NDs, however, were unbiased and showed high
correlation to the gold standard (rﬁ : 0.96; rp : 0.93).

3.3 Real applications

lodGWAS has already been applied by a number of cohorts as col—
laborators in a large—scale meta—GWAS project on serum levels of
CRP within the context of the inﬂammation working group of the
CHARGE consortium (http://www.chargeconsortium.com) (manu—
script in preparation). For each of these cohorts the effect sizes of
the individual cohort’s GWAS were comparable to those of the
meta—analysis (data not shown).

4 Conclusion

In this study we show the importance of applying an appropriate
statistical method for GWAS analysis of biomarkers whose measure—
ments are constrained by limits of detection. With lodGWAS we
provide a ﬂexible, easy—to—use R package for a simple and elegant
way to perform GWAS analysis of such biomarkers while accommo—
dating NDs.

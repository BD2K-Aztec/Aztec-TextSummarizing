ABSTRACT

Summary: CHOYCE is a web server for homology modelling of
protein components and the fitting of those components into cryo
electron microscopy (cryoEM) maps of their assemblies. It provides
an interactive approach to improving the selection of models based
on the quality of their fit into the EM map.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, single-particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM)
has become a major technique for structure determination of
macromolecular assemblies (Frank, 2006). However, the majority of
cryoEM density maps are still in the range of 5—15 A, far from atomic
resolution. Superior interpretation of these maps is now routinely
achieved by ﬁtting into them atomic structures of individual
components, such as proteins, domains and even secondary structure
elements (Chiu et al., 2005; Fabiola and Chapman, 2005). Many
ﬁtting methods have been developed, most of which rely on the
cross-correlation function (CCF) between the component structure
and the density map as a measure of goodness-of—ﬁt (Fabiola and
Chapman, 2005).

As experimental atomic structures of the assembly components
are often not available, it is becoming increasingly common to ﬁt
comparative models (or homology models) instead (Topf and Sali,
2005). We recently showed that a correlation exists between the
quality of a model [e.g. in terms of the root mean square deviation
(RMSD) from the native structure] and its CCF with the density
map (Topf et al., 2005). Based on that, a simple way to improve
ﬁtting accuracy is to generate a set of models using alternative
templates and alignments. One of the most accurate models can be
picked from this set based on its ﬁt into the density and possibly in
combination with other model assessment scores, such as statistical
potentials of mean force (Shen and Sali, 2006; Topf et al., 2005,
2006). Unfortunately, researchers frequently do not use this option,
despite the fact that it may lead not only to improved models, but
also to a better analysis of the EM map.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here we present CHOYCE, a web-based tool designed to
perform homology modelling constrained by cryoEM density ﬁtting,
which enables the selection of improved models of assembly
components. The CHOYCE server is freely available via the URL:
http://choyce.ismb.lon.ac.uk/ (a valid licence key is required for the
use of the MODELLER software).

2 METHODS
2.1 CHOYCE input

The server requires a density map and its parameters including the origin (in
respect to the Cartesian coordinates) and the resolution (A). The density map
format can be either CCP4/MRC or XPLOR and its size must be smaller than
2 GB. It provides two input options: (i) an aligned pair of a target sequence
and a template structure and (ii) an unaligned pair. In both cases. the template
has to be pre-ﬁtted in the density map. or at least placed in an approximated
position.

2.2 Homology modelling

In the ﬁrst step. CHOYCE generates homology models for the target
sequence using the automodel class of the MODELLER-9V7 python interface
(Eswar et al.. 2008; Sali and Blundell. 1993). If the ﬁrst input option is
selected. CHOYCE uses the given targetitemplate alignment to calculate
n models. as requested by the user. If the second input option is selected. it
generates l different alignments (as requested by the user) using the salign
method (align or alignZd) in MODELLER-9V7 (Madhusudhan et al.. 2009).
including one optimal alignment. and l—1 suboptimal alignments (Saqi
and Sternberg. 1991). Ten models are then built per alignment (n = 10 X l)
and each of them is assessed by the statistical potential score DOPE
(normalized_d0pe method in MODELLER-9V7) (Shen and Sali, 2006).

2.3 Density ﬁtting and model assessment

In the next step. CHOYCE selects the model with the lowest DOPE score.
and starting from the initial position for the template ﬁtted into the input
density map. it ﬁts the model locally within the map. The local ﬁtting is
performed using the Scanning Monte Carlo (SMC) optimization option of
Mod-EM. (density. grid_search in MODELLER-9V7. Topf et al.. 2005). with
the ‘SPECIFIC’ and ‘GAUSS’ options for the starting position and the atomic
density function. respectively. Next. all the remaining models are superposed
onto the ﬁtted model using rigid-body least-squares minimization. as
implemented in the model.superp0se command of MODELLER-9V7. The
user can also choose not to perform SMC. in which case all the models will
be superposed onto the ﬁtted template structure. Each of the models is then
scored in the map based on their CCF with the map (Topf et al.. 2005).

A typical CHOYCE job of modelling and ﬁtting 50 models of 200 amino
acids is completed in <10 min (independent of the size of the map). The
computational cost scales linearly with the size of the protein and the number
of models generated.

CHOYCE results appear in a web-based table. which may be accessed Via
a hyperlink automatically e-mailed to the user when the job is completed.
The table consists of the names of n homology models built for the input
target sequence and ﬁtted in the EM map. sorted based on their CCF score
(the highest score at the top). For each model both the CCF score and the
normalized-DOPE score are reported. The coordinates of each model can be
downloaded in a PDB format.

3 CASE STUDIES

As test cases, we used CHOYCE to generate two comparative
models, one constrained by a simulated density map and the
other by an experimental cryoEM map. In both cases, to measure
the accuracy of the models, we calculated Cat RMSDs from
the known native structures using least-square minimizations
(modelsuperpose in MODELLER-9V7).

The ﬁrst model is of subunit III of bovine heart cytochrome c
oxidase, based on the structure of E.coli ubiquinol oxidase (PDB
id: 1FFT, chain C, 22% sequence identity). The density map was
generated from the native structure of cytochrome c oxidase (PDB
id: IOCC, chain C, residues 74—261) using the molmap command
in Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). We then used CHOYCE option
2/align2d to generate 50 models based on ﬁve alignments to 1FFT,
and scored them applying the local ﬁt ﬁrst.

The second model is of the S.cerevisiae receptor of activated
protein kinase C 1 (RACKl) (PDB id: 3FRX, chain A, residues 5-
317), based on the structure of its homolog from Arabidopsis
thaliana (PDB id: 3DMO, chain A, 49% sequence identity). For
ﬁtting, we used the 8.9 Aresolution cryoEM map of the 80S
ribosome from the thermophilic fungus Tlanuginosus (EMDB ID:
1344, >85% sequence identity to S.cerevisiae). Because the density
associated with RACKl was identiﬁed on the small subunit (40S)
where it is bound near the mRNA exit, we used only the density of
the small subunit, which was previously segmented from the entire
80S density (Taylor et al., 2009). We then ﬁtted 3DMO into the
associated density and used CHOYCE option 2/align to generate
and score 100 models based on 10 alignments to 3DMO, and scored
them in the position of the ﬁtted template.

In both test cases, the best-ﬁtted model is the most accurate
model (ranked ﬁrst among 50 and 100 models, respectively). For
IOCC, the best model has Cat RMSD of 3.00A from the native
structure. It is 18.5% more accurate than the best model based on the
normalized-DOPE score (Cat RMSD: 3.68 A, ranked last, Fig. 1).
For RACKl, since the range of accuracy of the models was quite
small (Cot RMSD between 2.84 and 3.07 A), the best-ﬁtted model is
only slightly more accurate than the best normalized-DOPE model
(2.84 A versus 2.94 A), although ranked much higher (1 versus 40)
(Supplementary Fig. 1).

4 CONCLUSION

The CHOYCE web server provides a platform for homology
modelling and ﬁtting into cryoEM maps. The server aids in selecting
one of the most accurate models from an ensemble of models based
on the goodness-of—ﬁt to the EM map. Future improvements will
include modelling based on multiple template structures, as well as
iterative alignment, ﬁtting and reﬁnement using a combination of
CCF and statistical potential scores (Topf et al., 2005, 2006).

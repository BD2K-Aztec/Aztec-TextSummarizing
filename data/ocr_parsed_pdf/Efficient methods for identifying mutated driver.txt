ABSTRACT

Motivation: The first step for clinical diagnostics, prognostics and
targeted therapeutics of cancer is to comprehensively understand its
molecular mechanisms. Large-scale cancer genomics projects are
providing a large volume of data about genomic, epigenomic and
gene expression aberrations in multiple cancer types. One of the re-
maining challenges is to identify driver mutations, driver genes and
driver pathways promoting cancer proliferation and filter out the
unfunctional and passenger ones.

Results: In this study, we propose two methods to solve the so-cal led
maximum weight submatrix problem, which is designed to de novo
identify mutated driver pathways from mutation data in cancer. The
first one is an exact method that can be helpful for assessing other
approximate or/and heuristic algorithms. The second one is a stochas-
tic and flexible method that can be employed to incorporate other
types of information to improve the first method. Particularly, we pro-
pose an integrative model to combine mutation and expression data.
We first apply our methods onto simulated data to show their effi-
ciency. We further apply the proposed methods onto several real bio-
logical datasets, such as the mutation profiles of 74 head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas samples, 90 glioblastoma tumor samples
and 313 ovarian carcinoma samples. The gene expression profiles
were also considered for the later two data. The results show that
our integrative model can identify more biologically relevant gene
sets. We have implemented all these methods and made a package
called mutated driver pathway finder, which can be easily used for
other researchers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer is a complex disease which has been one of the most
serious threats to human health. People have realized that
cancer is related to genome aberrations that include gene muta-
tions, copy number alterations and so on (Hanahan and

Weinberg, 2000). Through these aberrations, the cancer cells
can acquire the ability of inﬁnite proliferation while normal
cells don’t due to the self-correction mechanism. Another dread-
ful feature of cancer cells is that some of them can spread to
other tissues through blood circulation or lymphatic system
(Fidler et al., 2003). This largely reduces the effectiveness of sur-
gery to treat cancer.

Generally, the genome aberrations in cancer cells can be
divided into two types: one type is neutral to cancer proliferation
and the other can promote the cancer cell to proliferate inﬁnitely
and diffuse (Greenman et al., 2007). We usually call the former
type of mutations as ‘passenger mutation’ and the latter as
‘driver mutation’. Undoubtedly, finding out the driver mutation,
driver gene as well as driver pathway is a key to understand the
molecular mechanisms of cancer progression, which further aid
in designing effective drugs to treat cancer (Overdevest et al.,
2009; Swanton et al., 2009).

With the development of high-throughput sequencing technol-
ogies, a huge number of mutation proﬁles of samples for many
cancer types are available now (Chapman et al., 2011; Stransky
et al., 2011; TCGA, 2008, 2011). Designing effective bioinfor-
matics tools to mine useful information from these data is a
challenging task. In gene level, much effort has been devoted
to detect the genes with significantly higher mutation rate
across samples than background mutation rate (Beroukhim
et al., 2007; Getz et al., 2007). Several studies have detected
some important gene mutations in cancer progression, but they
can’t capture the heterogeneity of genome aberrations. Many
studies found that there is little overlap between the gene muta-
tions of two samples even if they come from the same patient
(Ding et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008).

It is well known that different gene mutations may target the
same pathway (Hahn et al., 2002; Vogelstein et al., 2004).
Therefore, it is necessary to shift the point of View from gene
to pathway level, which is helpful to capture the heterogeneous
patterns in cancer. There have been several studies to discover
the mutation patterns in pathway level (Boca, 2010; Efroni,
2011). Most of them are based on known information about
pathways and try to ﬁnd out which ones are significantly per-
turbed. However, this kind of methods has one obvious limita-
tion: they only consider those known pathways. Taking into
account the incompleteness of knowledge about pathways, it is
indispensable to develop new algorithms to discover mutated
driver pathways or gene sets without relying on prior knowledge.

Given the huge number of genes in the whole genome, it seems
to be an unsolvable problem to enumerate and test all the

Finding driver pathways in cancer

 

candidates due to the enormous number of possible gene com-
binations. Several recent studies about combinatorial patterns of
mutations in cancer shed light on how to solve this problem
(V ogelstein et al., 2004; Yeang et al., 2008). They found that
driver pathways often cover a large number of samples. More
importantly, usually a single mutation is enough to perturb one
pathway. In other words, the mutation of genes in one pathway
usually exhibit mutual exclusivity. There have been several stu-
dies using these rules to expand the existing pathway-based
methods and identify completely new gene sets (Ciriello et al.,
2012; David et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2011). Ciriello et a]. (2012)
proposed the method Mutual Exclusivity Modules (MEMo) to
detect modules that obey the mutual exclusivity rule within a
gene functional network constructed based on prior knowledge.
In contrast, Miller et a]. (2011) proposed a method that identiﬁes
functional modules without any information other than patterns
of recurrent and mutually exclusive aberrations. More recently,
Vandin et a]. (2012) introduced a novel scoring function by com-
bining two measures (i.e. ‘coverage’ and ‘exclusivity’) to identify
the mutated driver pathway using the mutation data. The maxi-
mization of this scoring function is deﬁned as the maximum
weight submatrix problem, which was solved by a stochastic
search method. However, there is still no exact algorithm for
solving this problem. Moreover, considering the noise of the
mutation data, it’s interesting to incorporate more information
into this framework to improve this model.

In this study, we propose two methods to solve the so-called
maximum weight submatrix problem (V andin et al., 2012), which
is designed to de novo identify mutated driver pathways from
mutation data in cancer. The first one is based on a binary
linear programming (BLP) model, which is an exact method.
This method can be employed for assessing other approximate
or/and heuristic algorithms. The second one is based on the gen-
etic algorithm (GA), which is a stochastic and ﬂexible method. It
can be employed to optimize other scoring functions or incorp-
orate other types of information to improve the ﬁrst method. We
have integrated the gene expression data to achieve this. To test
the efﬁciency of our methods, we ﬁrst apply them onto simulated
data and compare them with another method. We further apply
our methods onto five biological datasets. The results show that
our integrative model can identify more biologically relevant
gene sets than the one without expression data.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 A brief introduction

Two important characteristics on the expected patterns of somatic muta-
tions have been employed to understand the somatic mutational process of
cancer in recent years. Particularly, Vandin et a]. (2012) introduced a meas-
ure to ﬁnd mutated driver pathways with two criteria (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst one
is ‘high coverage’, which means many patients have at least one mutation in
this pathway; the second one is ‘high exclusivity’, which means that most
patients have no more than one mutation in this pathway. Given the mu-
tation data represented by a binary mutation matrix A with m rows (sam-
ples) and n columns (genes), the original maximum weight submatrix
problem is deﬁned as ﬁnding a submatrix M of size m x k in the mutation
matrix A by maximizing the scoring function:

Although the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method proposed
by Vandin et a]. (2012) is a potential powerful procedure to solve this
problem, it is a stochastic search technique that may be trapped in a local
solution.

2.2 BLP: an exact method

To well understand this problem and assess the stochastic method, we
introduce a BLP model that can exactly solve this problem using a
branch-and-bound algorithm or others. Speciﬁcally, we can formulate
the original maximum weight submatrix problem into the following op-
timization problem:

y,,xje{0,l}, i=1,...,m;j=l,...,n.

where xj is the indicator whether column j of A falls into the
submatrix M, so all the columns js with xj = 1 constitute M; y,- is the
indicator whether the entries of row i of M are not all zeros. Accordingly,
f y,- represents the coverage and for]- > f ail) — i y,- represents the
average overlap. F1 [:1 [:1

Although the problem is NP-hard (V andin et al., 2012), we ﬁnd that
in real application this model can always be solved by a branch-and-
bound algorithm efﬁciently. We use IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer
to test the effectiveness of this model on simulation data. The experi-
ments are run on a 2.83-GHz Core 2 Quad CPU PC. When the gene
number of simulation data is smaller than 10 000 and the sample number
is smaller than 500, CPLEX can always get the exact solution in less
than 1 s.

2.3 GA: a stochastic method

As Vandin et al. (2012) discussed, other criteria can be designed to
achieve the similar goal. The BLP model may not be applicable to
other new scoring functions. To explore the maximum weight submatrix
problem in a more general manner, here we further design a GA
(Goldberg et al., 1989). The GA is a ﬂexible and powerful technique
that can be employed to optimize broad ranges of scoring functions.
Moreover, it can be easily extended for integrating other types of data
like gene expression, which will be discussed in the next subsection. The
GA method has a natural connection with the current problem in terms
of ‘gene’ and ‘mutation’. It simulates the genetic variation in a popula-
tion, and its evolution obeys a random selection mechanism. Moreover,
it doesn’t need to enumerate all the feasible solutions.

2.3.] The hypothesis space We use a binary string of zeros and
ones to represent an individual (a feasible solution here) of a population.
The length of every string in the hypothesis space is the gene
number n. After labeling every gene by 1,2, ...,n, the value 0 or 1
in the i-th position of an individual characterizes the membership
of the i-th gene in the submatrix M. Thus, all of the binary strings
with length n and sum k constitute the hypothesis space:
H: {(x1,x2, ...,xn)|x,- E {0,1},i= 1,2, ...,n, 2x,- = k}.

2.3.2 The ﬁtness function We need to deﬁne the ﬁtness function
over the hypothesis space H to measure the quality of the candidate
solution. In this application, we adopt the rank ﬁtness function. In
other words, the ﬁtness of each individual h,- (its corresponding submatrix
is M,-) of the population is deﬁned as the rank r,- of the score W(M,-) in the
ascending order.

2.3.3 Genetic operators The selection operator, crossover operator
and the mutation operator are always problem dependent. In this study,
given the rank r,- of an individual h,- based on its score, the selection
probability is deﬁned as follows:

2r,-

=m’ (1)

Pi
where P is the population size. The individual with the highest ﬁtness can
be transferred into the next generation with the highest probability.

To ensure that every offspring is feasible and to reduce the number of
iteration, we adopt a crossover operator to inherit properties of its par-
ents. Speciﬁcally, the offspring inherits those variables that are common
to both parents directly and makes a random selection of variables in the
symmetric difference of its parents’ genetic makeup.

In the mutation stage, we randomly change one variable value with 1
to 0, and another variable value with 0 to 1. This mutation operator also
ensures the feasibility of every offspring. To avoid premature convergence
and improve the accuracy of GA algorithm, we employ a local search
strategy to improve the search performance. Speciﬁcally, we randomly
change the value of two variables just as the mutation operator. If such a
replacement can improve the current solution, we accept it; when all
variables have been tested like this, then we terminate the search.

2.3.4 GA procedure The details of our implementation of GA are
described as follows:

Step 0: Given proper parameter settings, i.e. submatrix size k, population
size P, mutation rate pm (P: n and pm 2 0.1 were used in this study).
Randomly generate the initial population.

Step 1: In every iteration, P couples are selected from the current popu-
lation based on the selection probability [7,, and each couple generates
an offspring.

Step 2: Each offspring may optionally undergo a mutation with prob-
ability pm.

Step 3: All the parents and offsprings are ranked according to their
scoring value, and the best P individuals will make up the next gener-
ation, which is used as the current population in the subsequent
iteration.

Step 4: Check whether the iteration is trapped in one local solution
(e.g. the maximal scoring value does not improve in two consecutive
iterations). If so, run local search.

Step 5: Continue in this way until the termination criterion is satisﬁed
(e.g. the current maximal scoring value does not improve in 10 con-
secutive iterations). If so, then terminate the calculation.

2.4 Integrating mutation and gene expression data: an
integrative model

In real applications, there may be multiple optimal solutions. Moreover,
because of the noise in the data or other factors, the most ‘optimal’ ones
(the ones with maximal W(]Il)) may not be the best one in biological
context. To extract the most biologically signiﬁcant ones, we try to inte-
grate other types of data to improve this situation. Speciﬁcally, we gen-
eralize the aforementioned model by integrating the gene expression data
to improve its performance.

Before describing the simple integrative model here, we note that data
integration of many complementary layers is a powerful tool to reduce
noise and extract useful information from complexity (Ideker et al.,
2011). A recent wave of new bioinformatics methods has demonstrated
its power (Akavia et al., 2010; Zhang et al., in press). For example,
Akavia et al. (2010) developed a computational framework COpy
Number and EXpression In Cancer (CONEXIC), which integrates
chromosomal copy number and gene expression data for detecting aber-
rations that promote cancer progression. Beneﬁting from the incorpor-
ation of gene expression data, CONEXIC can distinguish the genes
within large ampliﬁed or deleted regions of a chromosome, while the
method based on the aberration data alone cannot accomplish this.

Our new model is based on such an observation that the genes in the
same pathway usually collaborate with each other to execute one func-
tion. Therefore, the expression proﬁles of gene pairs in the same pathway
usually have higher correlations than that in different pathways (Qiu
et al., 2010). Therefore, we can use this characteristic to discriminate
the gene sets with the same score. Besides, to ﬁlter out the noise in the
data and detect more meaningful gene sets, we try to identify gene sets
whose scores W(M) are close to the optimal solution but whose member
genes have higher correlations with each other (Fig. 1).

By combining the gene expression data with the earlier problem, we
deﬁne the following new measure:

FME = WU”) + A * R(EM) (2)

 

where R(EM) = Z W, EM is the gene expression submatrix that
11%!)

corresponds to the same gene set with the mutation submatrix M, pcc(>) is
the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient and xj, and x], are the expression pro-
ﬁles of genes jl and j2 in EM, respectively. The additional term R(EM)
incorporates information on functional homogeneity to enhance the bio-
logical relevance of the identiﬁed patterns. Taking into account that
R(EM) is between zero and one and W(M) is an integer, setting A = 1,
we can use F M E to discriminate the gene sets with the same Wall); setting
A 3 1, we can detect the gene set with strong correlation and approximate
exclusivity. In this study, we report the results with A = 1 and A = 10.
Although the maximization of F M E can be formulated into a binary quad-
ratic programming problem, it is limited by the computational complexity.
Here, we adopt the GA framework to solve it similarly.

2.5 Biological data

We collected ﬁve datasets to assess our methods (Table 1). For the ﬁrst
three data, we only use the mutation data to test BLP and GA. While for
the later two data, we use mutation data and expression data together.
The ﬁrst two datasets [lung carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme data
1 (GBM1)] are obtained from Vandin et al. (2012) directly. We also
downloaded another dataset about head and neck squamous cell carcin-
oma (HNSCC) (Stransky et al., 2011).

We obtained glioblastoma multiforme data 2 (GBM2) and serous
ovarian cancer data from TCGA website (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
tcga/). The data comprise of somatic mutations, copy number aberration
and gene expression. Here, we only use the data of Level 3. After pro-
cessing the data, we get two types of matrices: mutation matrix A and
expression matrix E. A is a binary matrix of size m x n, where m indicates
the number of samples and n indicates the number of genes. Each entry ail-
refers to the status of gene j in sample i: ail- : 1 if one of the following two
conditions holds: (i) the mutation of gene j in sample i is labeled valid
somatic (David et al., 2011) and (ii) gene j is in the statistically signiﬁcant
aberration regions of sample i ,which is determined by Genomic
Identiﬁcation of Signiﬁcant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) (Beroukhim
et al., 2007). E is a real matrix, and each entry eff is the relative expression
of gene j in sample i, which is obtained using the method described in
Roel et al. (2010).

3 RESULTS

We ﬁrst applied our BLP and GA methods onto simulated data
to test their performance and compare them with the MCMC
method to show their efﬁciency and characteristics.

3.1 Simulation study

We simulated mutation data starting with gene sets
M1,M2, ...,M1(I 3 1). Every set has k genes (k: 10 has been
used in this study). For each patient, we mutate a gene (chosen
uniformly at random) in M ,-(i : 1, 2, .. . , I) with probability
p,- (p,- : 1—i-A,A : 0.05 was used in this study), and if a
gene in M ,- is mutated, then with probability p0 we mutate
other genes in M,- (p0 : 0.04 was used in this study). Note that
p,- and p0 control the coverage and exclusivity of M ,, respectively.
The genes not in M ,- are mutated at most in three samples. The
parameter I controls the complexity of the data structure. When

we increase I, the simulation data and the problem get more
complicated.

We have compared the time complexity of BLP, GA and
MCMC on resolving the original maximum weight submatrix
problem through simulation data (Fig. 2). We show how the
time changes with respect to the number of genes under different
model complexity. The sample number of simulation data is
ﬁxed as 500, which is larger than all our applications. The
result of MCMC is obtained based on default parameters.
Surprisingly, we can see that our BLP method can get the opti-
mal solution in much shorter time than that of the MCMC. For
example, for n : 10000 and I : 5, the BLP can run in less than
1s, while MCMC needs more than 300s. We can also observe
that the GA is even faster than MCMC with n less than about
5000, which is larger than our all real applications in the follow-
ing part. In summary, our GA method has competitive efﬁciency
with MCMC, while our exact BLP method can work in a sig-
niﬁcantly shorter time than others, which enables it to be more
applicable to real data.

From the formulation of BLP model, we can intuitively
deduce that when the sample number increases, the constraints
number also increases, so the BLP model becomes more and
more complicated and the time required to resolve may rise.
We use simulation data to test this conjecture. In Figure 3, we
study how the computation time of GA and BLP scales with
sample number of simulation data. As the Figure 3 shows, the
time of BLP linearly rises with the sample number. However, GA
almost remains the same as the sample number increases.

Since the BLP model can be solved exactly, so it can always get
the optimal solution. As to the GA and MCMC, we found that
both show excellent performance in the data with ‘low’ complex-
ity (e. g. I : 1, 2) (Table 2). However, when we increase the com-
plexity of the data, the GA shows better performance than that
of MCMC (Table 2). Note that increasing the number of iter-
ations from 106 to 107 does not improve the accuracy of MCMC
(Supplementary Table S1). This observation clearly shows that
our methods are more applicable in real applications.

We also test the effectiveness of GA on detecting the gene set
by maximizing the integrative measure F ME. The simulation data
are produced according to the following procedures: (i) with pre-
deﬁned m, n and I, produce mutation matrix A using the previ-
ous methods and (ii) simulate one initial expression matrix E0, in
which each M I have the exact same expression proﬁle for each

Gaussian noise N(0, (I — i) - a) (a : 0.1 was used in this study)
for the expression proﬁles of each M,- to ensure
R(M1)<R(M2)< - - - <R(M]).

On the basis of these simulation data, we study the accuracy
and complexity of GA on maximizing the integrative measure.
Similar to the GA for the original model, the integrating muta-
tion and gene expression (IME) model optimized by the GA
algorithm can get the optimal solution for most cases. Such ‘op-
timal’ solution may not have the highest mutation score W(ZIJ) as
we designed for the simulation data. Figure 4 shows how the
computation time of GA evolves with gene number n for the
integrative model and the original model, respectively. The
curves clearly show that the GA algorithm for the integrative
model costs only about several-fold times of that for the original
model. We can also see that the complexity of data doesn’t show
dramatic impact to the computational time.

In summary, our BLP method is more efﬁcient compared with
the MCMC method for solving the original maximum weight
submatrix problem. Our GA method has competitive perform-
ance compared with the MCMC method, and it can also be

3.2 Biological applications

We have applied our methods BLP and GA onto ﬁve datasets
(Table 1) and compared their performance with MCMC. Note
that, when we solve the maximum weight submatrix problem,
we represent the genes that are mutated in the same patients as
one ‘metagene’ for further analysis. We adopt the permutation
test as used by Vandin et al. (2012) to assess the signiﬁcance of
the identiﬁed gene patterns. We report all the identiﬁed patterns
with k: 2710 (see Supplementary Materials). We also check
the second optimal patterns by removing the ‘optimal’ gene set
obtained in the whole dataset. The information of data resources
including the number of samples, the number of genes, the aver-
age number of mutations per sample and the maximum number
of mutation frequency for each dataset have been summarized
in Table 1.

We first apply our BLP and GA methods to the data used by
Vandin et al. (2012) to assess its performance compared with the
MCMC method. The BLP can obtain the exact results in less
than 1 s, while the GA and MCMC can get them in more than 60
and 5 s, respectively. This analysis ﬁrst shows that the BLP can
run in a more efﬁcient manner than MCMC and GA, while our
GA method also has acceptable performance. We found all these
three methods got the exact same results. For example, all the
three methods can lead to the same gene set (EGFR, KRAS,
S TKI I ) in lung adenocarcinoma dataset with k: 3.

In the following, we further apply our BLP and IME methods
onto three datasets that were not used by Vandin et al. (2012)
and discuss more to show the effectiveness of them. Note that the
BLP can efﬁciently get the exact results like before in less than 1 s
on all these three datasets.

3.2.1 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma It is well
known that HNSCC is a common, morbid and frequently
lethal malignancy (Stransky et al., 2011). To uncover its muta-
tional spectrum, Stransky et al. (2011) analyzed whole-exome
sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs and revealed
many genes that have not been implicated in this malignancy

Finding driver pathways in cancer

 

in previous studies (Stransky et al., 2011). The results imply that
the dysregulation of squamous differentiation may play a key
driving role in HNSCC carcinogenesis. This mutation dataset
covers 74 samples and 4920 genes; on an average, there are
130 coding mutations per sample. This mutation matrix is
sparse, and only two genes (TP53 and TTN) are mutated in
more than 20 samples. They are mutated in 46 and 23 samples,
respectively.

Considering the prevalence of TP53 and TTN mutation and
identifying other pathways not associated with TP53 and TTN,
we remove the genes TP53 and TTN from the mutation matrix
and ran these three methods on the remaining genes. When k : 6,
we get unique optimal gene set (AN04, CDKN2A, NFE2L2,
NOTCHI, SYNEI and TP63) which is altered in 60.8%
(45/74) of the samples with p-Value < 0.01. When k<6, the
optimal solutions are all subsets of these six genes. When k>6,
we will identify multiple optimal solutions (see Supplementary
Materials).

The analysis result of (Stransky et al., 2011) indicates that the
mutations of all CDKN2A, NOTCHI, TP63 and S YNEI func-
tion in the terminal differentiation in squamous epithelia directly
or indirectly (Fig. 5). We note that the set of these four genes is
one suboptimal solution with k: 4.

3.2.2 Glioblastoma The glioblastoma dataset obtained from
TCGA (2008) contains DNA copy number alteration and gene
expression proﬁles in 206 glioblastomas samples and nucleotide
sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 samples. After processing
these three types of data (see Materials and Methods), we built a
mutation matrix and an expression matrix that covers 90 samples
and 1126 genes.

We ﬁrst detect the mutation pattern, only depending on the
mutation matrix. When k: 2, we get two optimal gene sets: the
ﬁrst (CDKN2A, TP53) is the part of p53 signaling pathway;
the other is CDKNZB and one metagene comprising CDK4
and TSPAN3I. After analysis of expression data, we found

Fig. 5. (A) The submatrix of the ‘optimal’ gene set in the HNSCC data.
The mutation characteristic between a patient and a gene are shown: (red)
exclusive mutation; (soft red) cooccurring mutation; (white) no mutation.
It is similar for the other two ﬁgures. (B) The known pathway that the
identiﬁed genes are involved in is terminal differentiation, which was
reported to be related with HNSCC (Stransky et al., 2011). The pathway
interactions have been reported in Stransky et al. (2011)

that the correlation between CDK4 and CDKNZB is stronger
than that between TSPAN3I and CDKNZB. So, we have the
reason to believe that CDK4 is the one needing more attention.
In fact, although the pair (CDK4, CDKNZB) is the part of RB
signaling pathway, there is no direct evidence supporting the
relation between TSPAN3I and CDKNZB. This example
shows the potential advantage of combining expression data
with the original model: It can discriminate the genes within
identical mutation profiles and detect the one with the most rele-
vant functional relationship. We note that, when k: 3, the opti-
mal solution is the gene pair (CDK4, CDKNZB) together with
RBI. These two pathways have also been reported by Vandin
et al. (2012) using another dataset (GBMl).

We remove the above ﬁve genes and apply the methods to
detect the additional gene set. On the remaining genes, when
k:5, we identify the gene set (PTEN, EGFR, PIK3RI,
PIK3CA, GRIA2) that is mutated in 59 samples (p<0.01).
Other than GRIA2, the rest of the four genes are all part of
RTK/RAS/PI(3)K signaling pathway, which is signiﬁcantly
altered in glioblastoma (Fig. 6). Moreover, previous studies
have shown that GRIA2 plays important roles in glioma cells
(Beretta et al., 2009; Maas et al., 2001).

3.2.3 Ovarian carcinoma The ovarian carcinoma dataset is
obtained from a recent study (TCGA, 2011) that has analyzed
messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, promoter
methylation and DNA copy number alteration in 489 high-grade
serous ovarian adenocarcinomas and the DNA sequences of
exons from coding genes in 316 of these tumors. After processing
the data, we get a mutation matrix and an expression matrix that
cover 313 samples and 6108 genes.

The mutation distribution among genes is very non-uniform.
TP53 is mutated in the majority (251 /313) of samples, and all the
other genes are mutated in less than 25% of samples. In addition,
analysis of gene TTN indicates that the mutations of TTN are
likely artifacts (TCGA, 2011). Therefore, we remove TP53 and

Fig. 7. (A) The submatrix of ‘optimal’ gene sets (C CNE] ,M YC) in ovarian carcinoma data with k : 2 (the left plot). The right two submatrices are the
‘optimal’ gene sets identiﬁed by GA and IME, respectively, by removing the submatrix of (CCNE],MYC). Their respective scoring values are W: 102
and W: 101. But the genes in the later one have signiﬁcant stronger correlations, as illustrated in (B) ([Fvalue:0.0087, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
(C) The gene sets (CCNEI, M YC and KRAS, NF], MAPK8IP2, S TMN3) are involved in cell cycle and MAPK signaling pathways, respectively

TTN and ran the methods onto the remaining genes. When
k:2, we identify gene pair (CCNEI, M YC), which is approxi-
mately exclusively mutated in 135 samples (p<0.01) (Fig. 7A).
C CNEI and M YC are two important genes engaged in cell cycle
progression (Fig. 7C). When k: 3, the optimal gene set includes
this pair and NINJ2.

We remove the above genes and apply the methods onto the
remaining genes. When k 5 3, none of the optimal solutions are
signiﬁcant (p<0.01). When k: 4, the optimal solution is KRAS,
PPP2R2A, PRPF6 and RYR2 by the BLP model (p<0.01),
while using our integrative model (A :10), we get gene set
(KRAS, MAPK8IP2, NF], STMN3), which is one of the sub-
optimal solutions of the original model and is detected as
the optimal solution by our integrative model because of the
stronger correlations among genes (Fig. 7B). KRAS, NF] and
MAPK8IP2 are all part of MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 7C),
which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. The abnor-
mal expression of S TMN3 is associated with malignant progres-
sion of multiple cancer types (Fang et al., 2009; Singer et al.,
2009). However, there is not much evidence to support that the
genes detected by the original method based only on mutation
data show distinct functional relationship. This example shows
another advantage of our integrative model. It can detect the
gene set that has a suboptimal score but more relevant function
relationship. Notably, there may be multiple suboptimal solu-
tions with the same score. Thus, it is necessary to integrate
gene expression data to distinct and identify the underlying key
patterns.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Discovering mutated driver patterns in cancer is an important
problem in computational biology. In this article, we have stu-
died the de novo discovery of mutated pathways problem in
cancer, which has recently been explored by Vandin et al.
(2012). We ﬁrst proposed a BLP model to exactly solve the

so-called maximum weight submatrix problem. The exact
method is necessary to evaluate the performance of other
approximate or stochastic algorithms. We further suggested a
stochastic algorithm GA, which has natural connection with
the literal descriptions such as ‘gene’ and ‘mutation’. Both BLP
and GA show promising performance compared with the ori-
ginal MCMC method. Our study demonstrates that the MCMC
encounters serious problems in complex situations with multiple
high weight sets of genes for extracting the ‘optimal’ one.

We should note that this study focuses on the mutation at the
gene level instead of point mutation (single nucleotide) level. But
many known driver genes (e.g. P53) have hundreds of point
mutations, among which some are drivers and some are passen-
gers. With the development of biological technologies, more and
more point mutation data can be made available. Our method
could be expanded to a more detailed mutation data for finding
more sophisticated driver genes and pathways.

We also consider incorporating the gene expression data into
the aforementioned model to improve its performance. The new
integrative model can be helpful in two aspects. First, the inte-
grative model can be employed to distinguish the genes that have
identical mutation proﬁles. For example, in the glioblastoma
data (GBM2), CDK4 and TSPAN3] are in the same copy
number aberration region and have the same mutation profiles.
Our integrative model can well identify the CDK4 that has been
reported to be related with GBM while TSPAN3] does not.
Second, some signiﬁcant biologically relevant gene set with
strong correlations among their genes may be not the ‘optimal’
one with the scoring function W. Our integrative model can
identify such gene set well with the ‘optimal’ integrative score.
For example, in the ovarian carcinoma data, our integrative
model identiﬁed one different gene set with the original model.
Our analysis demonstrates that these genes have significant bio-
logical function connections between each other than that of the
original model.

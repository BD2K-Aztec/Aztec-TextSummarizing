ABSTRACT

Motivation: Molecular profiles of tumour samples have been widely
and successfully used for classification problems. A number of
algorithms have been proposed to predict classes of tumor samples
based on expression profiles with relatively high performance.
However, prediction of response to cancer treatment has proved
to be more challenging and novel approaches with improved
generalizability are still highly needed. Recent studies have
clearly demonstrated the advantages of integrating protein—protein
interaction (PPI) data with gene expression profiles for the
development of subnetwork markers in classification problems.
Results: We describe a novel network-based classification algorithm
(OptDis) using color coding technique to identify optimally
discriminative subnetwork markers. Focusing on PPI networks,
we apply our algorithm to drug response studies: we evaluate
our algorithm using published cohorts of breast cancer patients
treated with combination chemotherapy. We show that our OptDis
method improves over previously published subnetwork methods
and provides better and more stable performance compared with
other subnetwork and single gene methods. We also show that
our subnetwork method produces predictive markers that are more
reproducible across independent cohorts and offer valuable insight
into biological processes underlying response to therapy.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the treatment of cancers, patients presenting tumors with similar
clinical characteristics will often respond differentially to the same
chemotherapy (van’t Veer and Bernards, 2008). In fact, for many
types of cancer, only a minority of treated patients will observe
regression of tumor growth. This is the case for both conventional
chemotherapeutic agents and newer targeted therapies that affect
speciﬁc molecules. To achieve an effective cancer treatment,
it is critical to identify the underlying mechanisms that confer
chemoresistance in some tumors but not others.

The advent of genome-wide expression proﬁling technologies has
allowed the discovery of novel biomarkers for cancer diagnosis,

prognosis and treatment (van’t Veer and Bernards, 2008). While
some progress has been made toward identifying reliable prognostic
markers for breast and other cancers, development of molecular
markers predictive of response to chemotherapy has proved to be
far more difﬁcult (van’t Veer and Bernards, 2008).

In recent years, a number of studies have used genome-wide
expression proﬁling to identify genes that could be used as predictors
of drug response in breast cancer (Cleator et (11 ., 2006; Hess, 2006).
In these studies, single gene marker methods were used, where each
gene is individually ranked for differential expression and the top
genes were selected as predictors known as single gene markers.
Additional study (Lee et (11., 2007; Liedtke et (11., 2010) required
single gene markers not only to be differentially expressed but also
to have similar coexpression between the training and test cohorts.
While some of these predictive markers have shown promising
results in a limited number of patient cohorts, many of these
signatures have failed to achieve similar performance in additional
validation studies (Bonnefoi et (11., 2009). In addition, single gene
markers developed from different cohorts have been shown to
have very little overlap (Ein-Dor et (11., 2006). A further limitation
of single gene markers is that they provide relatively limited
insight into the biological mechanisms underlying response to drug
response. Thus, predictive markers with robust performance, greater
reproducibility and improved insights into drug action—which are
critical for clinical application—still remains elusive.

Previous studies have observed that gene products associated
with cancer tend to be highly clustered in coexpression networks
and have more ‘interactions’. Inspired by this observation, Chuang
et (11. (2007) introduced the use of all members of a protein—protein
interaction (PPI) subnetwork as a metagene marker for predicting
metastasis in breast cancer. Chuang et (11. (2007) demonstrated
that subnetwork markers are more robust, i.e. their results tend
to provide more reproducible results across different cohorts of
patients. Motivated by the limitations in predicting drug response
using single gene markers and the better performance promised
by subnetwork markers, this article aims to identify subnetwork
markers to predict chemotherapeutic response, as detailed below.

1.1 Subnetwork markers in other applications

Chuang et (11. (2007) deﬁned subnetwork activity as the aggregate
expression of genes in a given subnetwork. The discriminative
score of a subnetwork—which reﬂects how well the subnetwork
discriminates samples of different phenotypes (or classes)—was
derived from mutual information between subnetwork activity
and the phenotype. The study presented greedy algorithms for
identifying subnetworks with the highest discriminative scores and

demonstrates signiﬁcant improvement in classiﬁcation performance
over single gene marker approaches.

Another approach introduced by Chowdhury and Koyutiirk
(2010) used a binary representation of gene expression proﬁles to
retrieve subnetwork markers. Binarized gene expression proﬁles
were overlaid on PPI networks and subnetworks that contain genes
differentially expressed in all the samples from a given class are
chosen as markers. Using this approach, Chowhury et (11. were able
to predict colon cancer metastasis with high conﬁdence. Recently,
this group introduced an extension of their previous algorithm
which takes into account patterns of differential expression for
improved classiﬁcation performance (Chowdhury, 2010). A similar
approach using binary representation of gene expression proﬁles
was published by Ulitsky et (11. (2008), where subnetworks analysis
was applied to the identiﬁcation of dysregulated pathways in
Huntington’s disease.

More recently, Su et (11. (2010) identiﬁed paths containing many
differentially expressed and coexpressed genes from PPI networks
and greedily combined these paths to obtain subnetwork markers
for predicting breast cancer metastasis. Wu et (11. (2010) published
a report on the application of a network-based approach to drug
response data in Type 2 Diabetes. Samples were expression proﬁled
upon treatment with individual drugs and affected subnetworks
for these drugs were retrieved. These subnetworks were used to
score the individual drug effect and further used to predict the
effectiveness of the combination of two drugs. While the approach
by Wu et (11. (2010) proved to be useﬁil for the prediction of
a drug effect on network activities, the study did not attempt to
develop markers of response to any given therapy in any individual
patient.

Subnetworks from ﬁlnctional association networks can also
be used for the development of markers. Edges among gene
products in such networks [for example STRING database (Jensen,
2009)] are scored based on integration of different sources of
information such as high-throughput experiments, physical binding
extracted from literature and coexpression networks built from
many microarray experiments. Spirin and Mirny (2003) and King
et (11. (2004) have observed that the constituent gene products
of dense subnetworks contain many more edges than expected
and usually participate in the same biological function/process or
belong to the same protein complex. Dense functional association
subnetworks have been used in two recent papers by Dao et (11.
(2010) and Fortney et (11. (2010), which demonstrate that dense
networks signiﬁcantly improve the performance of subnetwork
markers from PPI networks in the classiﬁcation of colon cancer
metastasis and prediction of chronological age in Caenorhabditis
elegans.

Despite their improved performance, available approaches
have a number of disadvantages. Network-based approaches
introduced by Chuang et (11. (2007), Fortney et (11. (2010)
and Chowdhury and Koyutiirk (2010) are heuristic methods
and thus do not guarantee the optimality of the solution for
marker selection—an optimal solution would presumably provide
a better prediction performance. The branch and bound approach
(Chowdhury, 2010) or exhaustive enumeration (Dao et (11., 2010)
can yield an optimal solution under some ﬁxed set of parameters;
however, their worst-case running time can be super-polynomial
(and hence intractable). Therefore, there is a keen need for
designing efﬁcient algorithms to retrieve the optimal subnetwork

markers that could successﬁilly distinguish samples from different
classes.

1.2 Our contributions

In this article, we introduce a novel and efﬁcient randomized
algorithm to compute ‘optimally discriminative’ subnetworks for
classiﬁcation of samples from different classes. The discriminative
score is calculated as the difference between the total distance
between samples from different classes and the total distance
between samples from the same class. Our algorithm is based on
the color-coding paradigm (Alon et (11., 1995), which allows for
identifying the optimally discriminative subnetwork markers for any
given error probability. Since the running time of our algorithm is
a logarithmic ﬁlnction of the error probability, we can set the error
probability to a small value, close to zero, while the running time
does not increase much. When the maximum size of a subnetwork
is k=0(logn), where n is the size of the network, we have a
polynomial time algorithm with a ﬁxed error probability.

The evaluation of our method on published patients’ drug response
data demonstrate that optimally discriminative subnetwork markers
yield both greater and more robust classiﬁcation performance
compared with single gene markers and other subnetwork
markers. Moreover, our algorithm provides classiﬁcation results
which are reproducible across independent cohorts, and provide
greater biological interpretation of the underlying mechanisms of
chemotherapy response.

Since the discriminative score is additive, we can easily adapt our
method to retrieve subnetwork markers to distinguish samples from
more than two classes. This is very helpful, in particular, when there
are more than three categories for responses to treatment: complete,
partial and non-response.

2 METHODS

In our methodology, each patient sample is represented as a point in high-
dimensional space where each dimension represents one gene. We perform
dimensionality reduction by projecting samples (points) into a subspace
of at most k dimensions such that samples from different classes are
well separated. The separation criteria is deﬁned based on minimizing the
distances of samples from the same class while maximizing the distances
of samples from different classes. Figure l sketches the idea behind our
approach.

We formalize our problem as the Optimal Discriminating k-Subnetwork
(ODkS) problem below. We then assess the complexity of the problem and
ﬁnally give a randomized algorithm to solve it for any given error probability.

2.1 Problem deﬁnition and its complexity

Before formally deﬁning ODkS problem, we would like to introduce the
notations used. Without loss of generality, we assume that we have only two
classes of samples: positive and negative. Note that it is easy to generalize
our approach for more than two classes. Let A and A’ denote the expression
matrices for positive and negative samples, respectively. For each gene gi, let
A, and A;, respectively, denote the expression proﬁles of gene g, in positive
class and negative class. For expression matrixA (A’), letAiU) (AND denote
the expression of g, in sample j.

Given n genes, let a and (1’ denote the number of samples in positive class
and negative class, respectively. We denote the PPI network by G=(V,E),
where |V| =n and |E| =m.

We deﬁne the weight function w on subnetwork S as the difference
between the total distance between samples from different classes and the

Fig. 1. The main idea behind our approach: samples (denoted as points
in a high-dimensional space) are projected into k-dimensional space while
ensuring that samples from the same class are clustered together, while
samples from different classes stay separated. These k dimensions/genes
have to form a connected subnetwork in a PPI network. The main difference
between our approach and earlier ones is that we can identify the optimal
subnetwork SOFT in polynomial time when k = 0(logn); here n is the size of
the network. This is done by minimizing the total distance of samples from
same class while maximizing the total distance of samples from different
classes.

The ODkS problem asks to compute the connected subnetwork SOFT
(lSoprl 5k) from G such that SOFT ‘distinguishes’ samples from different
classes ‘optimally’, i.e. w(Sopr) is the maximum among w(S)’s for
any connected subnetwork S. We call SOFT the optimally discriminative
subnetwork.

For any connected subnetwork S, w(S) could be rewritten as:

We will extend the discriminative score function w so that it can apply on a
single gene. We assign each gene g, to a weight w(gi):

Now we can rewrite the discriminative score of a connected subnetwork S as:

M) = Z we»
Vi:g,~eS

Thus, identifying the optimally discriminative connected subnetwork SOFT
(|S| 5k) is equivalent to ﬁnding the connected subnetwork for which the
total weight of the vertices is maximum possible. A variant of this problem
without any restriction on the size of the subnetworks (k 5 n) was deﬁned to
extract dysregulated pathways in different cancer types by two independent
studies (Dittrich et (11., 2008; Qiu et (11., 2009). Both studies provided integer
linear programming formulations but rather than solving the IP formulation,
Qiu et a1. (2009) solved a relaxed version of the program, thus, did not give
the optimal solution, and Dittrich et a1. (2008) tried to solve the integer
linear program using a cutting plane methodihowever, this approach does
not guarantee a worst-case running time.

Another variant of the ODkS problem, the Connected k-Subgraph problem
(where the weights of vertices are either 0 or 1), is proved to be NP-hard
by (Hochbaum,D.S. and Pathria, A., in press). Here we prove that ODkS
problem is also NP-hard:

THEOREM 2.1. The ODkS problem is NP-hard even when we have one sample
for each class.

PROOF. The reduction is done from Connected k-Subgraph problem
deﬁned by (Hochbaum,D.S. and Pathria, A., in press). We are given an
instance of Connected k-Subgraph problem where we have a graph G:
(V,E), a weight function h: V—> {0,1} and positive integers k and 1. For
a subnetwork S, let g(S) be the number of vertices with weight 1. The
Connected k-Subgraph problem asks whether there exists a subgraph S in G
with at most k vertices such that g(S) Z 1.

We build an instance of the ODkS problem as follows. The network G’
for the instance of ODkS problem is the same as the given graph G i.e.
V’ = V and E’ =E. We only have one sample a = 1 for the positive class and
another sample for the negative class a’ = 1. For each gene g, corresponding
to a vertex v, in G, set A,(1)=O and A;(1)=h(v). Now for every vertex
v, such that h(v,»)= 1, we have the discriminative score w(v,»)= 1. By the
construction, the discriminative score of any connected subnetwork S ’ from
G’ is equivalent to the number of vertices with weight 1 of the corresponding
subgraph S in G. Thus, G has a subgraph S with at most k vertices and g(S) 31
if and only if the network G’ has a subnetwork S ’ also with at most k vertices
and w(S) Z 1.

2.2 A randomized algorithm

In this section, we give a randomized algorithm to solve the ODkS problem
for any given error probability. This randomized algorithm is based on color-
coding technique (Alon et (11., 1995).

Color coding is an algorithmic technique that was ﬁrst introduced by Alon
et a1. (1995) to detect a simple path or a cycle of length k in a given graph.
The algorithm consists of a predeﬁned number of iterations. In each iteration,
there are two main steps: assign each vertex uniformly at random with one
of k colors and detect whether there is a ‘colorful’ path or cycle of length k
in the given graph. A path or cycle is colorful if it is not the case that two
vertices 11, v in the path or cycle have the same color.

The idea behind the algorithm is the clever use of colors to reduce the
number of paths that need to consider in the detecting step. In the naive
algorithm, we need to keep track of every vertices Visited so far which uses
0(nk) time and space. Now we only keep track of all possible sets of vertices
of distinct colors which only take 0(n2k) time and space.

Color coding is widely applicable in the context of retrieving
‘homologous’ subnetworks from a PPI network given a particular query
pathway or protein complex (Bruckner et (11., 2010; Dost et (11., 2008; Scott
et (11., 2006; Shlomi et (11., 2006). Color coding has also been successfully
applied to retrieve network motifs (subnetworks which are recurrent more
than expected in a PPI network) and comparing PPI networks of different
species (Alon et (11., 2008; Dao et (11., 2009).

112 /3.Io's[Bumo[pJOJXO'sorwuiJOJurorqﬂ:duq urorj papeolumoq

2030 et al.

 

Similar to color-coding technique, our algorithm consists of a predeﬁne
number of iterations n, (we will show how to determine n, later). Each
iteration consists of two main steps:

(1) Assign a vertex uniformly at random with one of k colors.

(2) Identifying the colorful connected subnetwork S6171. (leprl 5 k) with
the maximum discriminative score w(SbPT).

We remind the readers that SOFT is the optimally discriminative connected
subnetwork while S617]. is the colorful optimally discriminative subnetwork
after each iteration. After n, iterations, we return S6” of some iteration that
has the the maximum w(SbPT). We will prove that we return SOFT with the
given error probability 8 by determining the number of iterations n, and
identifying the colorful optimally discriminative subnetwork S6171. in the
second step efﬁciently.

In the following, we describe how to estimate the number of iterations m.
For each iteration, the probability that we could retrieve SOFT is the same as
the probability that SOFT is colorful which is kI/kk Z eTk. In order to boost
the success probability to at least 1—8 for a given error probability (3, we
need

n,51n(1/5)ek
iterations to yield the S0171:

In what follows, we describe an efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithm
to retrieve the S6”. At each iteration, for any vertex v e V let color(v) denote
the color of v. By extending the notation of the discriminating function w
deﬁned earlier, we let w(u, T) denote the colorful connected subnetwork
S’ such that S’ contains 11, the color set of vertices in S’ is T and S’ has the
maximum discriminative score compared with ones of the colorful connected
subnetwork S ’ ’ ’s that contain 11. For the base case, for each vertex u, we have:

w(u) if c = color(v)
—oo otherwise.

W04’ {6}) = {
In the general case, we can compute w(u, T) as follows:

{w(u7P)+W(va)}}

w(u, T): max { max
Vv:uveE VP,Q:PﬂQ:0,PUQ:T
Here we assume that the addition of —00 and any real number or —00 is
—00. We ﬁrst compute w(v, T1) for each vertex v and each set T1 of one color
and so on. In the ﬁnal step, we compute w(v, Tk) for each vertex v and each
set Tk of k colors. Now we compute w(SbPT) as follows:

{worn}

/

W60”) Zvrgﬂ‘v { vrmili’irlgk

Now we estimate the running time complexity of this randomized
algorithm. Let deg(u) be the degree of vertex 11. For any vertex 11 and a set
of colors T, in order to compute each w(u,T), it takes O(deg(u)2lTl) time.
To retrieve S6171. at each iteration, it takes 0(mk4k) time. Thus, the worst-
case running time to retrieve SOFT is O(mkln1/6(4e)k). For our interests in
subgraphs of small size k: 0(logn) and for a ﬁxed probability of error, it
takes polynomial time to ﬁnd the optimally discriminative subnetwork SOFT.

2.3 Ranking subnetwork markers

From now on, we ﬁx the error probability (320.001 and the maximum size
of a subnetwork k = 7 of for any experiment performed later. For each vertex
v e V and for each size n’ from 4 to k, we compute the optimal discriminative
subnetwork that contain v with n’ vertices. In total, we have at most kn
subnetworks.

For each subnetwork S, we aggregate the expression proﬁles of genes in
S into a metagene s:

Am = ZAI’UVISI (1:131)

gies
Ale“) = EAR/mm (151:4)
gies

Now the normalized discriminative score of a subnetwork S is calculated in
the same way as we calculate the discriminative score w(g) for any gene g

in Section 2.1. We rank all the extracted subnetworks by their normalized
discriminative score. Then we select subnetwork markers from the top to
the bottom of the list as follows. Suppose L is the number of genes in the
selected subnetworks so far and S is the current considered subnetwork. S is
only selected if we have at least |S| /2 genes that are not from L. We ﬁnish
the selection process with 50 subnetworks.

2.4 Classiﬁcation process and performance assessment

We always consider top 50 subnetworks for our method for any experiment
performed after this point. For any 1 (1 5 l 5 50), we represent a sample using
top 1 subnetworks (S 1 , ...,S[) as follows. Each sample j is transformed into a
l-dimensional vector VU)E R! where the entries V(j)l for each marker 1 are

V0), := ZE(v,j)/ISII

VES]

where v ranges over all genes v contained in the subnetwork marker S,
and E(v, j) is the expression of gene v in sample j. In other words, each
sample j becomes apoint V0) in the l-dimensional feature space R’. Now, all
the classiﬁcation experiments were performed using three-nearest neighbor
classiﬁer under L1 distance.

Since the tested datasets have an imbalanced ratio between number of
samples in positive and negative class, accuracy is not a good measure
for classiﬁcation performance. We utilize Matthews Coefﬁcient Correlation
(MCC) as a measure to compare different classiﬁers (BW, 1975). MCC is
essentially the Pearson correlation between the vectors of predicted labels
and true labels of a testing set. Suppose that TP is the number of true positives,
TN the number of true negatives, FP the number of false positives and FN
the number of false negatives. The MCC can be also calculated as follows:

_ TP >< TN — FP >< FN
_ \/(TP+ FP)(TP+ FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)

 

MCC

 

If one of the four sums in the denominator is zero, the denominator is set to
one. This results in a Matthews correlation coefﬁcient of zero. MCC value of
1 indicates a perfect prediction, —1 an inverse prediction and O a completely
random prediction.

MCC is a recommended measure when compared with other measures for
classiﬁcation performance (Baldi, 2000). We have chosen MCC over area
under ROC curve (AUC) to facilitate comparison to competing models from
the MAQC-II study (Shi, 2010).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Dataset and network

We retrieved the human PPI data from the Human Protein Reference
Database (HPRD) version April 2010 (Prasad et (11., 2009). By
including both binary interactions and considering each protein
complex as a clique of proteins, we obtained 46 370 protein
interactions involving 9617 proteins.

We assessed the performance of our method on a human breast
cancer dataset contributed by the University of Texas MD. Anderson
Cancer Center (MDACC, Houston, TX, USA). The gene expression
proﬁles were retrieved from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) with accession number GSE20194. Gene expression data
from 230 Stage I—III breast cancers were generated from ﬁne-needle
aspiration specimens of newly diagnosed breast cancers before any
therapy. Patients received 6 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
comprising paclitaxel (T), 5-ﬂuorouracil(F), doxorubicin (A) and
cyclophosphamide (C) (and denoted as TFAC) followed by
surgical resection of the cancer. Responders to chemotherapy
was categorized as a pathological complete response i.e. no

invasive cancer. RNA extraction and gene expression proﬁling
were performed in multiple batches over time using Affymetrix
U133A microarrays. This dataset was split into two different cohorts
according to the time of collection. One cohort consists of 130
samples while the other one consists of 100 samples. The expression
proﬁles were normalized with Robust-chip Median Average (RMA)
algorithm (Irizarry et (11., 2003) and adjusted for batch effect using
ComBat (Johnson et (11., 2007). Prior to model generation, the
expression values of the two cohorts were normalized but not
standardized.

3.2 Classiﬁcation performance

We evaluated the performance of our method (we denote as OptDis)
against both single gene marker models and other subnetwork-
based methods following the workﬂow presented by the MicroArray
Quality Control (MAQC)-II studies (Popovici, 2010; Shi, 2010).
In those studies, the MAQC project assessed the performance and
limitations of various data analysis methods in developing and
validating microarray-based predictive models with the ultimate
goal of discovering best practices. Thirty-six groups participated
in the project to develop classiﬁers for 13 large datasets, including
the one used in our study. MAQC models (denoted as MAQC)
were constructed by these groups using different methods for data
processing (i.e. normalization), feature selection and classiﬁcation.

To assess the predictive performance, we performed two analyses.
In the forward cross-dataset (FXD) analysis, we treated the 130
patient cohort as the training set used for deriving markers,
and validated their performance on the 100 patient cohort. We
also performed the complementary backward cross-dataset (BXD)
analysis and swapped the cohorts used in training and validation.
In Figure 2, we compare the performance of OptDis against
single gene marker models. The single gene marker classiﬁer
constructed using t-test is denoted by SGM and includes only
genes that map to the PPI network. For each mappable gene, the
corresponding probe with the lowest P value was used in the
model. We also compared the performance of our method OptDis
against implementations of existing subnetwork-based methods, one
based on mutual information (GreedyMI) (Chuang et (11., 2007),
and another based on dense subnetworks (we denote as Dense)
using the STRING ﬁinctional network (Dao et (11., 2010). The
density threshold to extract all dense subnetworks is set at 0.7 as
implemented in Dao et (11. (2010). Note that, top 50 subnetworks for
GreedyMI and Dense are ranked based on their mutual information
scores. Starting from around 20 features, the performance of OptDis
is better than competing methods. While the maximum MCC value
is not that high, it is still signiﬁcant compared with the random
classiﬁer which has an MCC value of 0. Moreover, predicting
response to chemotherapy has been shown as a difﬁcult endpoint to
predict in the recent MAQC publications (Shi, 2010). The difﬁculties
might be due to the known heterogeneity within tumors of the
same cancer type, subtype-speciﬁc response, differences in drug
metabolism between individuals and variations in chemotherapy
schedules between patients (Popovici, 2010). Figure 3 shows the
average performance of models in cross-dataset validation of FXD
and BXD analyses. Here, the average performance for a model is the
average MCC of 50 models generated using the top 1—50 features.
The MAQC performance was derived from the average of top
model from each participating group. As shown in Figure 3, OptDis

Fig. 4. The bar charts show the average best MCCs of different classiﬁers.
The average best performance of a classiﬁer is the average of its best model
from FXD analysis and its best model from BXD analysis. Single gene
marker models include one based on t-test (SGM) and top 3 models from
MAQC project (MAQC GeneGo, MAQC SAI, MAQC GSK). Subnetwork
marker models include Chuang et a1. (2007) (GreedyMI), Dao et a1. (2010)
(Dense), and our approach (OptDis). Green bars show the average best MCCs

has consistent performance in cross-dataset validation experiments.
In contrast, the top three MAQC models show discrepancy in
performance when the datasets used for training and test were
swapped—especially in the case of the MAQC_ GeneGo model,
which has the largest difference in performance (0.25) between the
FXD and BXD analysis. The second and third best MAQC models
also show similar discrepancy in performance.

Figure 5 shows the performance of OptDis against one of the
predictive model constructed, where the constituent genes were
taken from the top x (1 f x f 50) OptDis subnetworks (we denote as
SGM_OptDis). We also compare our method against another single
gene marker model that ranks all genes by t-test and matches the
number of genes in the top x (1 3x 3 50) subnetworks from OptDis
(SGM_M). OptDis is consistently better than SGM_OptDis across
different number of features. This suggests the importance of treating
genes as ﬁinctional modules. Moreover, on the average constituent
genes taken from OptDis subnetworks tend to perform better than
genes from simple predictive model using t-test. Hence, OptDis
subnetworks might capture genes more informative to predicting
chemotherapy response.

In summary, our subnetwork markers have the best combination
of relatively high performance and greater stability between different
cohorts of patients and thus could be more clinically applicable to
other independent cohorts of patients.

3.3 Reproducibility of predictive markers

We compared the reproducibility of predictive markers derived
from subnetwork (SN) and single gene (SG) approaches by training
OptDis and SGM on the two different cohorts of 130 and 100 breast
patients and calculating the number of overlapping genes. For this
comparison, we considered the top 50 SN markers (T50 SN), the
top 50 SG markers (T50 SG) and the top X SG markers (Tx SG)
that comprises a similar number genes as the T50 SNs. There is an
overlap of 39 genes (27—30%) between the T50 SN, signiﬁcantly
more than the overlap of ﬁve genes (10%) between the T50 SG and
25 (17%) genes between T150 SG. Greater reproducibility may be
contributing to the improved stability in predictive performance of
our subnetwork markers over single gene markers.

3.4 Role of predictive markers in drug response

Gene function analysis: we hypothesized that the set of 39 genes
(039) common between the two T50 SN signatures trained on
different cohorts may be important to the activity of TFAC therapy.
Some of their biological functions are listed in Table 1. About half
are implicated in apoptosis, suggesting that changes in strengths
of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals can induce resistance to
chemotherapy. There are also genes involved in DNA repair, which
is expected given many of the anticancer drugs within TFAC therapy
induce DNA damage (i.e. cyclophosphamide by cross-linking DNA
strands).

Some of the 39 genes have speciﬁc functions related to mechanism
of individual TFAC drugs. Paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that
stabilizes microtubule activity during mitosis and induces cell
death. While paclitaxel is known to act on beta-tubulin, some
studies (Kavallaris, 2010) have also shown association between the
actin and tubulin cytoskeleton in drug response, and suggest that
regulation of actin cytoskeleton can induce sensitivity to mitotic-
inhibitors. From our 039 list, the EVL, RET and CST3 genes have
regulatory roles in the organization and assembly of actin ﬁlaments.

Fluouracil’s primary anticancer activity blocks DNA replication
by suppressing thymidyate synthetase activity and depleting
thymidine (Longley et (11., 2003). In vitro studies have shown
that AR and IGF2, from our 039 list, can increase incorporation
of thymidine, which acts in antagonist to thymidyate synthetase

suppression, to allow DNA synthesis through the actions of
thymidine kinase (Pedram et a1., 2007; Yang et a1., 1996).

Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that intercalates with
DNA and causes double-stranded breaks to induce cell apoptosis
or disruption in mitosis (Minotti et a1., 2004; Munro et a1., 2010).
SMAD3 from our list has been observed to affect BRCAl-dependent
double-stranded DNA break repair in breast cancer cell lines and thus
potentially may contribute to differential response to doxorubicin
(Dubrovska, 2005).

Signalling pathway analysis: ﬁnally, we also compared
subnetwork and single gene markers based on their insights
into the mechanisms underlying drug response. We derived the

T50 SN, T50 SG, and Tx SG from the combined cohort of 230
patients and used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA;
Ingenuity© Systems, www.ingenuity.com) to identify signiﬁcant
pathway associations. Interestingly, several signaling pathways
associated with chemotherapy response were identiﬁed for SN
markers, whereas no signiﬁcantly enriched pathways were found
for the T50 and T111 SG markers (Fig. 6). A closer examination of
the top associated pathways suggests response to TFAC treatment
is affected by the cross-talk between tumor subtype speciﬁc
mechanisms and pathways regulating apoptosis. Chemotherapy
response in breast cancer have been observed to be subtype-
speciﬁc (Sorlie, 2006), with ER+ tumors exhibiting much higher
response rates to taxane-based therapies than ER— tumors (Farmer,
2009; Liedtke, 2008; Popovici, 2010). Therefore, it was expected
to ﬁnd that the predictive subnetwork signature was strongly
enriched for genes activating the estrogen receptor (ER) signaling
pathway. For the same reason, we also observe an enrichment
for the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. With nearly
all ER+ tumors and few ER— tumors showing AR expression
(Niemeier et a1., 2010), it is likely that AR-based subnetworks
serve as good predictive markers of TFAC treatment based on their
association with ER status. Based on the enriched IPA pathways
associated with response, we speculate that the differential response
between subtypes may be attributed to differential regulation of
apoptosis. Experimental studies have shown that expression of
ERa selectively inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through
modulation of glucocorticoid receptor activity (Sui et a1., 2007).
Other response-associated pathways may also contribute
to differential response to TFAC treatment. For example,
signalling of insulin-like growth factor has known functions in
cancer proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, and has been
experimentally implicated in chemotherapy resistance (Benini,

RDao et al.

 

2001; Dunn et a1., 1997; Gooch et a1., 1999). The PI3K/AKT
pathway can also increase resistance to taxane-based therapies
through downstream anti-apoptotic effectors BCL-2 and BCL-XL
(McGrogan et a1., 2008). Experiments have shown that tumors
with increased phosphorylated BCL-2 expression have increased
sensitivity to paclitaxel compared with tumors with reduced
expression (Shitashige et a1., 2001).

We measured the reproducibility of these pathway enrichments by
performing IPA pathway analysis on both 039 genes and the T50
SNs derived from the pooled 230 patients using another SN method
(GreedyMI). Figure 6 shows that both predictive SN signatures were
signiﬁcantly enriched with the same pathways, which may implicate
a strong role for these pathways in response to TFAC treatment.

4 CONCLUSONS

From our analyses, we derived subnetwork markers from separate
cohorts of patients and clearly demonstrated the advantages of
using subnetwork markers over single gene markers for the
prediction chemotherapy response. The improved reproducibility of
subnetwork markers and its relevant insights into the underlying
mechanisms of drug resistance or sensitivity suggest that they may
serve as better clinical predictors of drug response.

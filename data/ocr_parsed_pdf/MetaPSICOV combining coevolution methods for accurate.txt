Abstract

Motivation: Recent developments of statistical techniques to infer direct evolutionary couplings
between residue pairs have rendered covariation—based contact prediction a viable means for ac—
curate 3D modelling of proteins, with no information other than the sequence required. To extend
the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta—predictor (MetaPSlCOV) which
combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence align—
ments, considers a broad range of other sequence—derived features and, uniquely, a range of met—
rics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment.
Finally, we use a two—stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage.
This two—stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range
network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues.
Results: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSlCOV achieves a
mean precision of 0.54 for top—L predicted long range contacts—around 60% higher than PSICOV,
and around 40% better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD,
MetaPSlCOV is able to improve the TM—scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with
PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range hydrogen bonding, MetaPSlCOV—HB achieves a precision
of 0.69 forthe top—L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 forthe baseline MetaPSlCOV.

1 Introduction

 

Determining protein structure from its amino acid sequence remains
an unsolved problem within bioinformatics (Dill and MacCallum,
2012). In order to make this notoriously complex goal more tract-
able, one simplification which can be made is to reduce the problem
to identifying pairs of interacting residue pairs within the native
structure, termed ‘contacts’. For many years, accurate contact pre-
diction was hampered by the effects of the relatedness of

homologous sequences and the inability to extract correct residue
pairings from vastly intertwined networks of contacts (de Juan
et (11., 2013). Recently, there has been considerable progress in
reducing the effects of these two sources of noise, allowing for su-
perior prediction accuracy (Taylor et (11., 2013).

Current methods for contact prediction use large multiple se-
quence alignments to identify interacting residues through correlated
mutation analysis. Extracting contacts using correlated mutation

analysis exploits the observation that within protein structures,
interacting residue pairs are under evolutionary pressure to maintain
their interaction (Altschuh et al., 1987; Neher, 1994; Poon and
Chao, 2005). In the event that one residue of such an interacting
pair mutates, the effect of the mutation can be accommodated by
the ‘correlated’ mutation of its interacting partner. Therefore, by
identifying positions within a multiple sequence alignment which
appear to coevolve, it is possible to infer that these positions are in
close proximity in the native protein structure.

Contact maps derived from correlated mutation analyses are
now of sufficient quality to enable accurate de novo structural mod—
elling of both globular (Kosciolek and Jones, 2014; Marks et al.,
2011; Michel et al., 2014) and membrane proteins (Hopf et al.,
2012; Nugent and Jones, 2012), as well as identifying residues at the
interface of protein complexes (Ovchinnikov et al., 2014; Weigt
et al., 2009). Whilst contacts are clearly useful for constraining mod—
elling procedures, even small numbers of incorrect predictions are
drastically detrimental to the modelling process (Konopka et al.,
2014). Despite considerable progress in the accuracy of predicted
contacts from sequence, further increased precision will allow for
more accurate models to be produced (Michel et al., 2014).

It has been shown recently that the incorporation of two differ—
ent coevolution methods, based on distinct underlying principles, is
able to increase the accuracy of contact prediction (Skwark et al.,
2013). In this study, we develop MetaPSICOV, a hybrid method
that combines a classical neural network—based contact prediction
method with three different coevolution methods, in order to im—
prove the accuracy of predicted contacts from multiple sequence
alignments. An additional aspect of MetaPSICOV is to modulate
predictions according to both the local and global quality of the
multiple sequence alignment. Thus for alignments that have little
depth, either in local regions or over the entire length of the target
protein, MetaPSICOV can effectively down—weight the optimal con—
tributions that should be made by coevolution compared with more
traditional features such as predicted secondary structure and solv—
ent accessibility. This means that for poor alignments, MetaPSICOV
will behave more like a standard machine learning—based contact
prediction method, whereas for deep high—quality alignments more
emphasis will be placed on coevolution signals.

2 Methods

2.1 Datasets for training and benchmarking
The benchmark test set for this study is the original PSICOV test set
of 150 single domain monomeric proteins with the same alignments
as made publicly available back in 2011 (Jones et al., 2012). To en—
sure full comparability with earlier work, no attempt was made to
extend the alignments using more up to date sequence data banks.
The neural network components of MetaPSICOV were trained
on a set of 624 highly resolved protein chains with no overlap to the
test set. To start with, we took a non—redundant (percent sequence
identity <25%) set of 1780 protein chains from PDB (Berman et al.,
2000) with resolution $1.5  and chain lengths between 50 and 500
residues. Overlapping proteins between the original PSICOV test set
and the initial training set were identified by using HHSEARCH
(soding, 2005) to align test set sequences with training set HMMs.
Alignments and HMMs for the training set were calculated using
three iterations of HHBLITS (Remmert et al., 2012) with an E—value
threshold of 10’3 and the March 2013 release of the UNIPROT20
HMM library. The alignments were stored in both PSICOV (Jones
et al., 2012) native and A3M formats. Any chain in the initial

training set matching a test set sequence with an HHSEARCH
E—value <10’3 was excluded, leaving a final training and validation
set of 624 chains (Supplementary Table 51).

To investigate performance of MetaPSICOV on smaller protein
families, we collected an additional set of PDB chains with no over—
lap with the training set (HHSEARCH E—value >1.0), resolution
£2.0A and chain lengths between 50 and 400 residues. For these
protein chains, alignments were generated with HHBLITS as
described above, and chains with between 50 and 500 homologous
sequences were selected as the second test set. This second test set
comprised 434 chains (Supplementary Table 52).

Three separate coevolution calculations on the alignments were
carried out using PSICOV v2.1, mean field DCA as implemented in
the FreeContact package (Kajan et al., 2014) and CCMpred
(Seemayer et al., 2014). The same alignments were used in each
case, in PSICOV format for PSICOV and FreeContact and A3M for—
mat for CCMpred.

In addition to the coevolution features, a number of other simple
statistics are computed from the same alignments using a C program
(alnstats). These statistics are listed in the feature set section below,
and are divided into single alignment column—based statistics (e.g. the
amino acid frequencies in each column) and pairwise column statistics
(e.g. mutual information scores between each pair of columns).

2.2 MetaPSlCOV input features

A total of 672 input features are used in the first stage classifier to
predict the likelihood of residue 1' and i being in contact. As a start—
ing point for input features, we considered the feature set used in the
SVMcon method (Cheng and Baldi, 2007). Here, in both training
and predicting, three windows are defined: one nine residue window
centred at position i, one nine—residue window at position i and a
central window of five residues at the midpoint 1/2(i +/). At every
position in each window, 21 features provide information on the
amino acid composition in alignment columns 1', j and 1/2(i+/),
counting gaps as the 21$t amino acid type. The next four column
features are the probabilities of helix, strand and coil states, and a
predicted solvent accessibility in the range 0—1 (0 being completely
buried and 1 being fully exposed). The secondary structure probabil—
ities are derived from PSIPRED (Jones, 1999), and the solvent ex—
posure from a derivative of PSIPRED called SOLVPRED. The final
two column features are the Shannon entropy (—Zk pk log pk) of
the alignment column and an extra input to indicate missing data,
i.e. where the window exceeds the limits of the sequence.

The next set of input features (six in total) provide coevolution
information for each pair of alignment columns, and are as follows:
mutual information, normalized mutual information (Dunn et al.,
2008), mean contact potential, PSICOV score, meCA score and
CCMpred score. The mean contact potential is computed by averag—
ing contact potential terms (Betancourt and Thirumalai, 1999;
Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1985) across the two alignment columns.

To encode the sequence separation 11' — [1, 16 features are used to
represent values in the following ranges: (i—/( < 5, (i —/( :
{5,6,.,13}, 14 g li—jl < 18,18 3 li—jl < 23, 23 g li—jl < 28, 28
g li—jl < 38, 38 g li—jl < 48,(i—/1248.

The remaining features are derived from the whole alignment
and do not depend on the window locations: global alignment
amino acid composition (21 features including gap composition),
global fractions of predicted secondary structure states (three fea—
tures), global average—predicted solvent exposure, log sequence
length, log number of sequences in the alignment, log effective num—
ber of sequences in the alignment and global average Shannon

entropy. Effective sequence counts were calculated by clustering
protein sequences with a 62% sequence identity threshold, and then
assigning equal fractional weights (w,:1/n) to sequences in each
cluster, where n is the cluster size. Effective sequence counts are then
calculated as Neg: 210,. A summary table of the features used is
given in Supplementary Table 53.

For the second stage classifier, which correlates the outputs of the
first stage classifier, a total of 731 input features are used. In this case,
two windows of 11 alignment columns are defined at location i, /,
though the central window is omitted in this case. The same column
features defined for the first stage classifier are also used for the two
windows in the second stage. In addition the same sequence separ—
ation features are included. The remaining 121 features comprised an
1 1 X 1 1 matrix of values, centred at location i, j which are taken from
the relevant outputs of the first stage (summarized in Supplementary
Table 53). This matrix therefore represents a 2D (square) window on
the first stage predicted contact map, and thus allows a refined contact
map to be generated by taking into account correlations between
nearby predicted contacts from the first stage network. This second
stage also allows us to predict other kinds of inter—residue interactions,
e.g. main chain hydrogen bonding, as described later.

2.3 Neural network architectures and training procedure
Both first and second stage classifiers are classic feed—forward neural
networks, with 55 hidden units and a single output unit. To train
these very large networks, alternate rounds of offline and online
training are carried out until no further improvement in accuracy is
obtained on a separate validation set, which comprises 10% of the
original training data.

The classification of residues as contacting (true positive) or
non—contacting (true negative) was made by calculating CB—CB dis—
tances in the protein chains, with different thresholds. For glycine
residues, the C01 position was used in place of the CB. In final bench—
marking, only the usual threshold of 8A was used, but in training
we used five different contact distance thresholds: 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5 and
10A. An additional criterion that was used was to set a threshold
distance of 8 A, but then only consider negatives where the distance
exceeded a second threshold of 11  In this latter case, residue pairs
with an intermediate distance were excluded from the training pro—
cess. Each of these six thresholds was used to generate a separate
neural net and in making a prediction, the outputs of the six net—
works are combined by averaging. As CB—CB contacts are symmet—
ric, for each L residue protein chain in the training set, 1/2L(L — 1)
residue pairs are considered in testing and training.

The training data are obviously highly unbalanced given that
only around 5% of residue pairs make contacts in a typical protein
fold. However, we find that subsequent calibration of the network
outputs is a better way of handling this bias than either undersam—
pling negative cases or oversampling the positive cases. Once the
network training is complete, the outputs can be transformed to esti—
mated Positive Predictive Values (PPVs) by a log—linear function:

PPV : a log(bx + c),

where a, b and c are adjustable parameters obtained by least—squares fit—
ting to the observed PPVs when the training data are re—presented to the
networks and binned according to neural network output score (x).

2.4 Meta PSICOV—HB

By a small modification to the second stage classifier and the train—
ing scheme, it is straightforward to develop an additional predictor

which can specifically predict main chain hydrogen bonding pat—
terns rather than generic residue—residue contacts. In this case, posi—
tive cases will be residue pairs where the first residue acts as donor
for a backbone hydrogen bond (N—H---O : C) to the other. In this
case, the relevant contact is directional and so the resulting contact
map can no longer be assumed to be symmetric. In antiparallel
sheets, of course, a symmetric pair of contacts can occur, as a
bridged pair of residues will be involved in two hydrogen bonds
going in opposite directions.

In training and testing, we arbitrarily assign the donor role to
residue 1' and the acceptor role to residue /, and a true positive is only
considered where the amino nitrogen in i is within 3.5  of the car—
bonyl oxygen in i. No attempt was made to reconstruct the amide
hydrogen positions as for main chain hydrogen bonds in highly
resolved proteins, the heavy atom distance criterion is generally suf—
ficient on its own to determine whether an energetically favourable
hydrogen bond is formed. Short range (sequence separation <5)
hydrogen bonds are not considered because these mostly relate to
alpha helices and can be trivially inferred from secondary structure
prediction alone, and so the sequence separation binary input for
the (i —/( < 5 case was replaced by a binary feature which simply in—
dicates pairs where i> /, which is needed because pairs 1', j and j, i
can no longer be considered equivalent.

2.5 Folding simulations

To evaluate the usefulness of MetaPSICOV contacts in de HOUO pro—
tein structure prediction, we carried out a benchmark on contact—
assisted fragment assembly using FRAGFOLD (Jones et al., 2005 ).
Details of the benchmark have already been described (Kosciolek
and Jones, 2014), where we evaluated the usefulness of PSICOV
contacts in assisting de novo protein structure prediction. Two slight
modifications were made here. First, a slightly revised FRAGFOLD
energy function is used, with short range (ii—fl < 23) and long
range contacts treated as two separate equally weighted energy
terms. Second, to select a single representative model from each en—
semble, the model with the lowest total FRAGFOLD energy was se—
lected. This is a more conservative selection procedure than our
previous study, where we took the best model from the five lowest
energy models, but this more closely represents the way in which
models would be selected in practice.

3 Results and discussion

The accuracies of MetaPSICOV and the component methods were
evaluated on the widely—used benchmark dataset of 150 proteins
used to test the original PSICOV algorithm (Jones et al., 2012).
Figure 1 shows the relative overlap between the three component
coevolution methods applied to this set, which clearly demonstrates
the value of a three—way consensus, with at least 10% of correct con—
tacts (13% in the case of CCMpred) being unique to each method.
The analysis of results is divided into two parts, based on the se—
quence separation of predicted pairs, as contact predictions between
residue pairs lying far apart in the sequence are more difficult to pre—
dict than the ones closer in sequence separation. With this in mind,
mean precision scores are given at sequence separation 25 and 223
residues, respectively. Two residues are considered to be in contact
with each other if the CB—CB distance is <8 A, which is in accord—
ance with the standard assessment procedure introduced in the
Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction experiment
(Ezkurdia et al., 2009). Table 1 depicts the mean precision values
obtained for different methods including PSICOV, DCA, CCMpred

sequences are available, but steadily increases weight on the covari—
ation data as the number of effective sequences approaches 200.
Another interesting point is that performance of MetaPSICOV with
200 effective sequences is roughly the same as the best individual co—
variation—based method with a median effective sequence count of
621 (the median for the original PSICOV test set). Thus,
MetaPSICOV is able to extend the usefulness of covariation—based
contact prediction to significantly smaller families than those that
have been the focus of earlier studies.

It is of course of interest to compare MetaPSICOV with the re—
cently published coevolution—based contact metapredictor, PconsC.
Although the general idea of combining multiple coevolution meth—
ods is the same in both cases, the philosophy behind the ways in
which variation in alignment quality is taken into account is sub—
stantially different. In the case of PconsC, to achieve maximum per—
formance a set of eight different alignments are required, from two
different alignment methods and four parameters settings in each
case. In the case of MetaPSICOV, however, a single alignment is
used, but is supplemented by an array of features which describe the
local and global quality of the given alignment. As both methods
make use of the same testing set of 150 proteins used in testing
PSICOV, it is also possible to make at least a rough quantitative
comparison between them. One slight complication is that PconsC
does not make use of the original PSICOV alignments, but instead
uses several combined alignments that clearly will include more up—
to—date sequence data. That being said, MetaPSICOV still appears
to perform well in comparison to PconsC, as can be seen in Table 1.

The fact that MetaPSICOV can achieve better results than
PconsC without requiring sets of alignments to be generated from
different methods and different runtime parameters is clearly advan—
tageous in terms of convenience and reduced computation. This also
possibly insulates MetaPSICOV from systematic changes in both the
underlying sequence data banks and the alignment methods as time
goes on. However, it is certainly worth considering that
MetaPSICOV might be further improved by also being trained on a
range of alignments, and this is something that we may explore in
the future.

The mean precision scores for MetaPSICOV—HE and a naive
method based on the standard MetaPSICOV algorithm for the top—
L/10 contacts is reported in Table 2. The top—L/10 contacts are
chosen in this case as there are significantly fewer long range hydro—
gen bonds in proteins compared with general long range contacts.
For the naive method, any top—L/10 contact predicted by
MetaPSICOV between residues in predicted beta strands is assumed
to be a donor/acceptor pair, but with the donor—acceptor labelling
being ignored. For MetaPSICOV—HE, however, only correctly
labelled donor—acceptor pairs are counted as true positives. Table 2
clearly shows the added value that MetaPSICOV—HE gives over the
standard method when predicting the hydrogen bonding networks

in proteins, with a mean precision value 0.69 for long range hydro—
gen bonds compared to 0.26 for the naive method. This additional
information on the directions of hydrogen—bonded residue pairs
could be invaluable in improving the quality of models produced by
de novo methods, though finding the optimal way to use this infor—
mation will take some effort.

The last part of this study involves evaluating the use of
MetaPSICOV contact constraints for improving de novo protein
structure models. For each of the 150 benchmark proteins, 20 mod—
els were generated by FRAGFOLD using three different predicted
contact sets: PSICOV, MetaPSICOV stage 1 and MetaPSICOV stage
2 contacts (9000 models in total). To ensure that all useful contact
information was being used, each contact list was cut off at a preci—
sion threshold of 0.5, i.e. all the contacts used were estimated to
have a >0.5 probability of being correct.

Without any contact constraints, the median TM—score for
FRAGFOLD without contact constraints is 0.27, compared with
0.41 for PSICOV, 0.46 for the first stage MetaPSICOV contacts and
0.43 for the second stage contacts. Figure 5 shows the distributions
of TM—score differences between the PSICOV representative models
and the MetaPSICOV models from each target ensemble. Scatter
plots for each comparison along with the underlying data are shown
in Supplementary Figure 52 and Supplementary Table S6. For 108
targets out of 150, the first stage MetaPSICOV contacts produce
better models than PSICOV with a median improvement of 0.05
TM score units. For 40 targets, however, the improvement is quite
substantial with an improvement of at least 0.1 TM units.
Surprisingly, given that more correct long range contacts are
included in the second stage contact lists, results are slightly worse
than those from the first stage, with only 99 targets showing an im—
provement, and a median improvement of only 0.02 TM units.
Although this looks puzzling at first glance, the explanation is al—
most certainly down to the same redundancy issue that has been
described previously. Suppose we were to predict the full set of con—
tacts between a pair of hydrogen—bonded beta strands, but just two
contacts between a pair of helices elsewhere in the structure. The
additional contacts along the strands are not particularly inform—
ative as most derive purely from the regular hydrogen bonding pat—
tern. In this case, therefore, correctly modelling the beta strand
pairing might satisfy five times as many constraints as correctly
modelling the pair of helices, even though the helices may contribute
far more to the overall model TM score. Consequently, the global
optimization procedure is likely to be strongly biased towards sat—
isfying the beta strand constraints rather than the constraints be—
tween the helices in this hypothetical case. Note that this is only an
issue because the contact constraints are probabilistic in nature. If
all the constraints were real, then it is obvious that the best possible
model would then result from simply satisfying all of the contacts.

By analyzing the test set by fold class (or, Oil?) and (3) we see some
support for this hypothesis. Ignoring the 10 targets with few second—
ary structures, for the 16 all—0i targets, a positive median TM—score
difference of 0.04 is indeed observed between the first and second
stage results, whereas for the 93 Oil?) and 0i+ (3 targets a median dif—
ference of —0.05 is observed. For the 31 all—B targets no difference is
observed.

Although the sample sizes make firm conclusions impossible,
these results do suggest that appropriate balancing between or—helix
and B—sheet contacts is needed to exploit the second stage predicted
contacts properly. Not only do short range contacts need to be sepa—
rated from long range contacts (as we already do), but the redun—
dancy in 3D constraints between neighbouring contacts also needs
to be considered in an ideal weighting scheme. How this should best

ABSTRACT

Summary: Multiple templates can often be used to build more
accurate homology models than models built from a single template.
Here we introduce PconsM, an automated protocol that uses
multiple templates to build protein models. PconsM has been among
the top-performing methods in the recent CASP experiments and
consistently perform better than the single template models used in
Pcons.net. In particular for the easier targets with many alternative
templates with a high degree of sequence identity, quality is readily
improved with a few percentages overthe highest ranked model built
on a single template. PconsM is available as an additional pipeline
within the Pcons.net protein structure prediction server.

Availability and implementation: PconsM is freely available from
http://pcons.net/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Accurate predictions of protein structures are important, as we will
never have access to experimental structures for the vast majority of
proteins. While high-quality experimental structures are extremely
important, homology-modeling techniques are, widely applicable,
much cheaper and can be applied on genomic scale.

A wide array of methods for protein structure prediction exists,
both stand-alone software such as Modeller (Sali and Blundell,
1993) and Nest (Xiang, 2003), or available as web servers.

The performance of different methods is assessed biannually
through the community-wide CASP experiment. Among other
things, CASP has highlighted the importance of consensus-based
approaches to the structure prediction problem. The oldest such
method is Pcons (Lundstrom et (11., 2001). The creation of Pcons
was inspired by the successful consensus predictions made by
the CAFASP team at CASP4. Pcons has been among the top-
performing automated predictors since CASPS and the top model
quality assessment program in both CASP7 and 8 (Larsson et (11.,
2009; Wallner and Elofsson, 2007). The Pcons method is available as
a web server (Wallner et (11., 2007) at http://pcons.net/, where users
can upload their protein sequences and obtain consensus predictions.

One limitation in Pcons.net is that it is based on single
template models, while it is well accepted that the use of multiple
templates readily can improve the quality of models (Larsson
et (11., 2008). However, one problem when using multiple templates

is that sometimes the different alignments contain contradictory
information, which results in convergence problems.

Here, we show that PconsM on average improve the models
with a few percentage points within the popular Pcons.net protein
modeling web server. The beneﬁts of PconsM are several. Primarily,
the qualities of the models appear on average to increase somewhat.
Secondly, the use of multiple templates frequently leads to larger
coverage of the target sequence, which means that less ‘free’
modeling is necessary. The throughput of Pcons.net [detailed
in Wallner et (11. (2007)] is not affected by PconsM. An initial model
is obtained within a few minutes and the ﬁnal model is achieved
within 24h for the majority of targets.

2 THE PCONSM MULTIPLE TEMPLATES
PIPELINE

At Pcons.net, an initial RPSBLAST (Altschul et (11., 1997) search
is performed to determine the ‘difﬁculty’ of the target sequence, as
determined by the E-values returned by blast. The sequence is also
submitted to a number of external servers such as HHpred (Soding,
2005) and SAM-T02 (Karplus et (11., 2003); alignments are collected
from a set of fold recognitions serves and models are built using
Modeller. PconsM is implemented as a separate extension to this
pipeline that is run when the internal and external predictions by
Pcons.net are completed, and updated as soon as there are new
alignments available. The input template sequences are ranked based
on the quality score from Pcons.net for the corresponding single
template models. From this ranking, multiple alignments with up to
six template sequences are constructed using shell scripts. These are
then used to build models as in our previous study, where in general
model quality deteriorated with more than six templates (Larsson
et (11., 2008). In the last step, the quality of each of these six
different models is assessed individually using the novel model
quality assessment program ProQ2 (Ray et (11., 2010; Wallner and
Elofsson, 2003).

3 SUMMARY

We benchmarked PconsM by assessing the increase in quality
(TM-score) of these models over the baseline, consisting of the
top-ranked, single-template models from Pcons.net.

In total, roughly 45% of the targets that a model created from
multiple templates are better than the best single-template model.
In some cases, the improvements are around 0.1 TM-units (Fig. 1).
However, for the majority of targets the typical scale of improvement
is around a few percentage points. The sum of TM-score showed
a consistent increase over Pcons in both CASPS and CASP9, see

TM—score (Pcons.net)

Fig. 1. CASP9 TM-scores for Pcons.net and PconsM, respectively, showing
the per-target difference between the two methods. For the majority of targets,
TM-score is increased with PconsM. For target T0599, highlighted in the
ﬁgure, improvements can be seen in the central (blue) beta-sheet, and the
loop sticking out in the Pcons model to the lower right is absent in the
PconsM-model. TM-score is increased roughly to 0.1.

a subset of 90 comparable models) and CASP9 (108 targets released in
November 2010)

 

 

 

Method CASP8 CASP9

Easy Hard All Easy Hard All
PconsM 50.1 8.8 58.9 56.3 9.2 65.5
Pcons 48.8 8.6 57.4 55.2 9.0 64.2
HHpred 46.4 6.9 53.3 54.0 6.7 60.7

SAM-T02 46.2 7.4 53.6 47.9 6.7 54.6

 

The results using the top ranking alignments from HHpred, Fugue and SAM-T02 were
included as these were the highest performing single predictors used by Pcons.net. It
should be noted that for some of the methods the predictions submitted to CASP were
clearly better than the ones available locally for Pcons.net.

Table 1. The sum of TM-score for the highest ranking models is
58.9 and 65.5 for PconsM in CASP8 and 9, respectively, and 57.4
and 64.2 for Pcons.net.

Multiple templates help to improve the quality of protein
structures. Making a method available that can readily use multiple
templates is of great importance, particularly since there is not an
abundance of such methods available as web servers. The inclusion
of multiple template models in Pcons.net means that the user will
have a greater number of models to choose from when making the
ﬁnal decision about which model to use for further studies.

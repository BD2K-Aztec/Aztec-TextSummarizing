Abstract

Motivation: The multispecies coalescent model provides a formal framework for the assignment of
individual organisms to species, where the species are modeled as the branches of the sp tree.
None of the available approaches so far have simultaneously co—estimated all the relevant param—
eters in the model, without restricting the parameter space by requiring a guide tree and/or prior
assignment of individuals to clusters or species.

Results: We present DISSECT, which explores the full space of possible clusterings of individuals
and species tree topologies in a Bayesian framework. It uses an approximation to avoid the need
for reversible—jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo, in the form of a prior that is a modification of the
birth—death prior for the species tree. It incorporates a spike near zero in the density for node
heights. The model has two extra parameters: one controls the degree of approximation and the
second controls the prior distribution on the numbers of species. It is implemented as part of
BEAST and requires only a few changes from a standard *BEAST analysis. The method is eval—
uated on simulated data and demonstrated on an empirical dataset. The method is shown to be in—
sensitive to the degree of approximation, but quite sensitive to the second parameter, suggesting
that large numbers of sequences are needed to draw firm conclusions.

1 Introduction

 

Despite its alleged status as a fundamental concept in biology, the
species category has lacked a definition allowing explicit testing of
particular species limits (e.g. de Queiroz, 2007). In recent years
however, several methods have been proposed for the task of de-
limiting species hased on molecular data (see Fujita et a]. [2012] and
Miralles and Vences [2013] for reviews). Multispecies coalescent
(Rannala and Yang, 2003) species delimitation (MSCSD) methods
make use of multi-locus sequence data to make inferences in the
presence of incomplete lineage sorting.

All current MSCSD methods are either heuristic (e.g. O’Meara,
2010), dependent on a guide tree (e.g. Satler et (11., 2013; Yang and
Rannala, 2010; note however that a paper by Yang and Rannala
[2014] appeared during the revision of this article, where the re-
quirement of a user-supplied guide tree is eliminated) or are valid-
ation methods, which require prior assignment of individuals to
clusters or species. Knowles and Carstens (2007) devised a max-
imum-likelihood approach, which uses fixed gene trees as input data
and hierarchical likelihood ratio tests to compare different species
classifications. These are treated as different stochastic models with

different sets of parameters, and the hierarchical likelihood ratio
tests require the models to be nested. Thus, for example, the classifi—
cation of putative species A, B and C into AB and C or A and BC
cannot be compared in this way, whereas ABC can be compared
with either. A Bayesian alternative which takes uncertainty in gene
tree estimation and does not require compared classifications to be
nested is to use Bayes factors, which can be achieved from accurate
marginal likelihood estimates (Baele et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2011).
Grummer et al. (2014) and Aydin et al. (2014) used this approach to
choose among species classifications, and Leaché et al. (2014b) ex—
tended the approach to be used for single—nucleotide polymorphism
data.

O’Meara (2010) devised parametric and non—parametric heuris—
tic methods to simultaneously find an optimal assignment of individ—
uals to species and their tree relationships. Yang and Rannala
(2010, 2014; Rannala and Yang, 2013) developed the idea in a
Bayesian framework, in which the gene trees are co—estimated with a
constrained species tree. In the simplest option, species are inferred
by setting a threshold on the posterior node heights of the species
tree, with small heights interpreted as evidence for collapsing a
node. This is similar to using "BEAST (Heled and Drummond,
2010) with each individual in its own ‘species’ in the XML file, and
estimating the actual species afterwards. The dimensionality of the
parameter space does not change, and there is no special prior
involved.

Here, we take a Bayesian approach, which has the advantage
that nuisance parameters can be integrated out, and also that prior
taxonomic knowledge can be taken to account. Our approach does
not require prior assignments of individuals to putative species, and
may be viewed as species tree inference while taking uncertainties in
MSCSD into account. We present Division of Individuals into
Species using Sequences and Epsilon—Collapsed Trees (DISSECT) for
species delimitation which requires no prior assignment of individ—
uals to clusters or species, but instead explores the full space of pos—
sible clusterings and tree topologies. It is along the lines of the
method of Yang and Rannala (2010) which employs a user—supplied
guide tree in which some nodes may be collapsed (i.e. all descend—
ants of these nodes assigned to one species). In the most recent ver—
sion of BP&P (Yang and Rannala, 2014), there is no need for the
user to supply a guide tree. Instead, the ‘guide tree space’ is explored
using nearest—neighbor interchange moves. The two operations of
collapsing a node, and of setting its height to zero, have the same ef—
fect on the likelihood, since the multispecies coalescent density is the
same for a single population and a population which has just split at
time 0. When a node is collapsed, the dimensionality of the param—
eter space changes, so a reversible—jump Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (rjMCMC) algorithm is needed to sample the species trees.
The basic idea behind DISSECT is to sample trees in which each tip
represents a single individual (or a cluster of individuals which defin—
itely belong in one species), but replace the usual prior density on
node heights with one which includes a spike near zero. The dimen—
sionality of the parameter space is fixed, but nodes whose heights
have a high posterior probability of being within the spike can be in—
terpreted as ‘probably collapsed”.

2 Methods

A set of individual organisms will be called a cluster. Each possible
cluster of individuals in the analysis is a candidate for constituting a
species. A set of clusters which do not overlap one another and
which together include all the individuals in the analysis will be

referred to as a clustering. In an analysis using DISSECT, some sets
of individuals may be grouped by the user as minimal clusters: these
may be merged but never split. We use ‘gene’ in a loose sense, to
mean an alignment of a sequence region which is assumed to be
homologous and unlinked to other such regions. A ‘gene copy’ is a
single row from such an alignment.

2.1 The model

In Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, a prior distribution over species
trees is needed, and for rooted trees as used here, the reconstructed
birth—death process (Gernhard, 2008) is most often used. It includes
the Yule process as a special case. The process is assumed to begin at
some time t in the past with a single species, and is conditioned on
producing the observed number of species at present. The time t is
called the ‘origin time’ or ‘origin height.” Theorem 2.5 of Gernhard
(2008), following Thompson (1975) shows that, conditioned on t,
the speciation rate /l, and the extinction rate u, the density of the un—
ordered node heights are independently and identically distributed
and are also independent of the number of tips k. This nice mathem—
atical property makes the present model tractable. Let the density of
a node height 5 be 7' (5(k, t, /l, u) :f(s(t, /l, y). In the present model,
f(s) is replaced with a mixture off(s) and another density m(s) for s:

(1 -w)f(sltriru)+wm(s)r (1)

where a) is a user—chosen weight in [0,1], and this density is used for
all the 11—1 node heights in a tree with 11 tips. The joint density is
then

where C(k) is the set of subsets of {1,. . . , n — 1} of size k — 1. If m(s)
was the Dirac delta function (9(5) (Dirac, 1958), the result would be
a distribution in which the trees with k external branches of non—
zero length (i.e. the trees with k ‘real’ tips) have total probability
mass

Note that the product HEX f(si(t, A, u) is the density for a recon—
structed birth—death process with k tips whose node heights are the
k — 1 non—zero 5,. In practice one cannot sample from such a distri—
bution without implementing rjMCMC, but it can be approximated
it using

where 8 is small.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the densities f and (1 — w)f +wm, re—
spectively, for the case 11:3, where there are two internal node
heights. One way of sampling trees from the reconstructed birth—
death process for n : 3 is to pick a point (x, y) from a density such
as the one in Figure 1; then choose a random ordering of the tip
labels from left to right; then insert x and 3/ between them; and fi—
nally join the nodes to form the tree. The same process is shown in
Figure 2 for the mixture density m. If the point (x, y) is in one of the

critical. Note that these values are based on the premise that the mu—
tation rate is set to 1, or that one is set to 1, and the others are esti—
mated relative to this.

When the number of individuals per species is small, it becomes
difficult to estimate the population size parameters in each branch in
the multispecies coalescent model. In such a case, care must be taken
to use a sensible prior on these parameters, especially the
‘species.popMean’ parameter. We recommend that the prior should
be proper, and diffuse enough to accommodate extreme but possible
values, but not absurdly diffuse. This is good advice anyway when
using "BEAST, but it becomes more critical when using DISSECT,
since it will typically be harder to ensure that the number of individ—
uals per species is not small.

3 Evaluation

3.1 Simulated scenarios and parameter settings

Two sets of simulations were run. The first set evaluates the perform—
ance of DISSECT as the number of genes and the amount of
incomplete lineage sorting varies, and assesses the sensitivity of the
method to choices of 8 and w. The second set focuses on the case of
one true species. We use Ne to mean the effective number of (diploid)
individuals in a population. If N6 is constant, this means that the ex—
pected time for two gene copies to coalesce is 2Ne generations. We de—
note the mutation rate per site per generation by u. Node heights and
8 are in the same units as the product “Ne. Note that the topology
and node heights of the gene trees only depend on the product “Ne,
so a scenario with u : 1e—8 and Ne : 50 000 is equivalent to one with
u : 1e—9 and Ne : 500 000 and so on. There are two sources of
‘noise’ in the data: one comes from coalescences which are deeper
than species tree node height and the other from the randomness of
mutations. For a node height of 0.001 and a gene length of 500, the
expected number of substitutions separating two species is 1, so
around 37% of pairs of gene copies from different species would be
identical if they coalesced at the species node height.

The first set (SIM—5x5 ) of simulations all use 25 individuals, 5 as—
signed to each of 5 species, with one gene copy per individual. The
species tree has a comb topology with node heights at 0.001, 0.002,
0.004, and 0.008. These heights are chosen to roughly approximate
those in the empirical dataset (see below). The value of 2Ne was
69 000 at the tips and at the rootward ends of branches, and
138 600 at the root and tipwards ends of internal branches, varying
linearly along the branches. The length of the genes was set to 500
sites, and the number of genes G was set to 3, 9, or 27. The muta—
tion rate u was set to 2e—9, 1e—8, or 5e—8, representing small, mod—
erate, and large amounts of incomplete lineage sorting. In coalescent
units 2uNe, the height of the most recent speciation is 5, 1, and 0.2,
respectively. The root of the species tree is at 0.008/T generations,
and is therefore 4 000 000 generations when u : 2e—9, 800 000 gen—
erations when u : 1e—8 and 160 000 generations when u : 5e—8. To
get some idea of the amount of signal and noise due deep to coales—
cences in the data, consider the G :9 case, where there are 4500
sites. For H : 2e—9, the number of variable sites is about 100. In the
case M : 1e—8, the number of variables site is around 200, and in the
case M : 5e—8, it is around 500. The increase in variable sites as y in—
creases is due to deeper coalescences.

We explored the accuracy of the method with respect to changes
in 8 by using a beta prior for a) with shape parameters 8 and 2, and
setting 8 to 0.0001 : 1e—4, 3e—5, and 1e—5. We also explored the be—
havior with respect to different priors for w by fixing 8 to 1e—4, and
setting a) to 11/12, 5/6, and 17/24, corresponding to prior means for

k of 3, 5, and 8. In addition, two sets of runs performed with a Beta
hyperprior on a) with parameters (8,2) and (1,1), respectively. The
former distribution has a peak at 4, and the latter means that the
probability is uniformly distributed.

The second set SIM—1 of simulations all use u : 1e—8 and
Ne : 100 000, meaning that the simulated genealogies span one co—
alescent unit. In this case a single species was simulated, so the gene
trees are all the result of a coalescence process only. The product
“Ne scales the number of substitutions, and thus affects the accuracy
with which genes trees can be estimated, but does not change the
underlying ‘shape’ of the problem. The value of 8 was 1e—4. A beta
prior with shape parameters 8 and 2 was used for a), which means
that the prior was biased toward more than one species. We used
11 :4, 8, and 16 individuals and G was set to 3, 9, and 27 to exam—
ine how these variables affect the rate of false splits.

3.2 Implementation of simulations

The simulated data was generated and analyzed using R (R
Development Core Team, 2011) and the R packages APE (Paradis
et al., 2004) and phangorn (Schliep, 2011). Gene trees were simu—
lated according to the multispecies coalescent model for each scen—
ario and parameter choice, for 50 replicates. Sequence alignments
with 500 sites were generated for these gene trees using Seq—Gen
(Rambaut and Grassly, 1997) called with command

squen.exe -mHKY-’c3.0 -fO.3,0.2,0.2,0.3

This uses a strict clock and the HKY substitution model, and all
genes have the same mutation rate. There is no site rate heterogen—
eity. These sequences were then incorporated into BEAST XML
files, and DISSECT was run for 50 million generations with the
first 25 million discarded as burn—in. The priors for species.
popMean, meanGrowthRate and the relative clock rates were
all lognormals, with means and standard deviations in log space
equal to —7 and 2, 4.6 and 2 and 0 and 1, respectively. The prior
for relativeDeathRate was uniform in [0,1]. Species
DelimitationAnalyser was run after DISSECT with the first 25 mil—
lion discarded as burn—in.

3.3 Empirical data
Species delimitation in the pocket gopher genus Thomomys sub—
genus Megascap/aeus has been controversial, with a large number of
species described by early taxonomists. Most of these have been
reduced to subspecific rank by twentieth century taxonomists
inspired by the biological species concept (e.g. Wilson and Reeder,
2005). According to opinion of these recent authors, the number of
species in the dataset of Belfiore et al. (2008), also used by Heled
and Drummond (2010), vary between 6 and 8, depending on how
the species T. bottae, T. umbrinus and T. townsendii are delimited.
We explored the dataset, which consists of 26 individuals which
were defined as ‘species’ and 7 non—coding nuclear sequence regions
(Belfiore et al., 2008), by varying 8 from 1e—7 to 1e—3, and by setting
a) to 0.12 or 0.68 (corresponding to subspecies elevated to species
rank, and eight species, as classified in Belfiore at al. [2008], respect—
ively). We also used a Beta hyperprior with parameters 4 and 2
(Fig. 3). Each combination of 8 and a) was run for 200 million gener—
ations, saving parameter values and species trees every 5000th
generation. SpeciesDelimationAnalyser was run with ‘5 equal to 8.
The second dataset is an extension of the data used by Aydin
et al. (2014) for a group of species in the flowering plant genus
Silene L. They used marginal likelihood estimates as well as the soft—
ware BP&P (Yang and Rannala, 2010) to compare species

The ambiguous assignment of several individuals in the
Thomomys dataset may indicate violations to the assumptions of
the model (e.g. no hybridizations), or that the data are not inform—
ative enough. To assess absolute fit of the data to the model, poster—
ior predictive simulation—based model checks may give clues to the
reasons for this (Reid et al., 2013). Indeed, the Thomomys data
showed poor fit to the multispecies coalescent model in the survey
by Reid et al. (2013), and one possible reason to this might be
mis—assignment of alleles to species.

The results of our analysis of the data from Silene sect.
Cryptoneurae (Fig. 7) are in agreement with the conclusions of
Aydin et al. (2014). The posterior probabilities for clades and MSC
membership are almost identical from the analysis with an inform—
ative Beta prior (Fig. 7A) to that with an uninfirmative prior
(Fig. 7B). However, the support for pairs of individuals belonging to
the same species (cluster) is often low. We propose that a possible
reason for this pattern, also seen in the Thomomys data, might
be structured populations due to for example, gradual speciation
(see also below). If that is the case, it might be convenient to use a
combination of species tree support for clades and the pairwise simi—
larity matrix to aid further considerations about species member—
ships. High posterior support for clades in the species and
congruence among gene trees, but low resolution below that may
indicate occasional migration/hybridization. The multispecies
coalescent model assumes no migration after speciation, which is
instantaneous. This is probably violated in most cases.

Zhang et al. (2011) found that low rates (<0.1 migrant per gen—
eration) of migration had virtually no effect on the accuracy of
BP&P in a simulation study. However, at least when sample size is
small, a single sampled recent migrant can cause severe effects. The
coalescent prior on the gene trees will affect them in a way that sin—
gle recent introgressions will be ‘pushed back” by other gene trees
that reflect the ‘true” speciation event, such that the coalescent time
for the migrant may be biased. More research is needed to evaluate
the robustness of the model to hybridization, and in particular per—
haps, to gradual isolation of species, which may be the most com—
mon form of speciation (e.g. Barton and Charlesworth, 1984).
Recent studies (Heled et al., 2013; Leaché et al., 2014a) indicate
relative robustness of the MSC model to gradual speciation models
when it comes to species tree topology inference, but severe effects
regarding polation size and divergence time estimates. The effect on
MSCSD methods remains to be explored using both simulated and
empirical datasets.

4.3 Conclusion

‘Given the intrinsic theoretical and empirical difficulties of the prob—
lem, any success would be surprising.” (O’Meara, 2010). We believe
that DISSECT is a useful step forward on the theoretical and compu—
tational side. The multispecies coalescent model has assumptions
that are likely to be violated and it remains to be seen how import—
ant these are for empirical data.

We have not formally evaluated the accuracy of the species trees
produced by DISSECT. However, apart from the approximation
involving 8, and the slightly different prior on the tree root height,
the DISSECT model, when conditioned on a particular clustering Z,
is equivalent to "BEAST using Z to assign individuals to species.
This means that DISSECT can be used as in a regular "BEAST ana—
lysis, taking uncertainties in species delimitation into account. The
new version of BP&P, which appeared as advance access (Yang and
Rannala, 2014) late in the review process of this article has similar

properties, and the accuracy of the two approaches may now be
compared.

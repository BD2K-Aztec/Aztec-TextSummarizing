ABSTRACT

Summary: In recent years, the improvement of mass spectrometry-
based glycomics techniques (i.e. highly sensitive, quantitative and
high-throughput analytical tools) has enabled us to obtain a large
dataset of glycans. Here we present a database named Xeno-
glycomics database (XDB) that contains cell- or tissue-specific pig
glycomes analyzed with mass spectrometry-based techniques,
including a comprehensive pig glycan information on chemical struc-
tures, mass values, types and relative quantities. It was designed as a
user-friendly web-based interface that allows users to query the data-
base according to pig tissue/cell types or glycan masses. This
database will contribute in providing qualitative and quantitative infor-
mation on glycomes characterized from various pig cells/organs in
xenotransplantation and might eventually provide new targets in the
a1,3-galactosyltransferase gene-knock out pigs era.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cell surface carbohydrates can act as ligand molecules for diverse
biological processes such as cellwell interaction, signal transduc-
tion, metastasis and so forth (Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006; Rudd
et al., 2001). Especially in pig-to-human xenotransplantation, the
interaction between terminal a-Gal (Gala1-3Gal-R) antigens
onzz pig tissues or cells’ surfaces and circulating natural human
antibodies lead to hyper acute immune rejection (Oriol et al.,
1993). Despite the development of a1,3-galactosyltransferase
gene-knock out pigs, unidentiﬁed non-Gal antigens remain as
possible factors triggering delayed xenograft rejection
(Ezzelarab et al., 2005). Thus, the comprehensive identiﬁcation
of a-Gal and non-Gal carbohydrate antigens from pig tissues
and cells is essential for successful xenotransplantation.

During the past decades, several databases have been
developed to assist the assignment, annotation and interpretation
of glycan and glycoconjugates datasets (Campbell, et al., 2011;
Campbell et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2003; Kameyama et al., 2005;
Raman et al., 2006; von der Lieth et al., 2011). However, none of
them systematically classify and update the pig glycans according
to the speciﬁc pig tissues and cells. Qualitative and quantitative
information on the glycan antigens, which play an important role
in immune rejection, is also lacking.

Here, we have built up a relational database [Xeno-glycomics
database O(DB)] from speciﬁc pathogen-free Chicago Medical
School miniature pig (Setcavage and Kim, 1976) glycan profiles,
which have been qualitatively and quantitatively characterized
by various mass spectrometry-based techniques (Supplementary
Data). It includes N—glycomes from pig kidney (Kim et al., 2008,
2006), endothelial cells, islets (Kim et al., 2009a), corneal endo-
thelial cells, keratocytes (Kim et al., 2009b), heart and glyco-
sphingolipid-derived glycans from pig endothelial cells and
islets (Kim et al., 20090). The O-glycomes from pig kidney, endo-
thelial cells (Park et al., 2013) and heart (accepted) are also
included. This specialized pig glycome database will offer a
new insight into pig-to-human xenotransplantation as well as
into many different areas of biological and biomedical research.

2 METHOD

XDB is based on open-source technology, developed in jruby 1.7.0 and
trinidad1.4.4 Tomcat 7.0.37 and tested on Debian. The database was used
in SQLite version 3.0 as a data storage program. The HTML-based web
interface has been tested using Safari 6 and Chrome 22. The updated
version of web browsers is recommended for the usage of the XDB.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Two major query options are implemented in XDB, namely, ‘pig
tissue/cell specific glycans’ and ‘mass spectrometry-based glycan
searching’ (Fig. 1, Supplementary Data). The ‘pig tissue/cell spe-
ciﬁc glycans’ option allows the retrieval of glycans derived from a
speciﬁc pig tissue/cell. Users can obtain the full lists of glycans
by clicking a speciﬁc pig organ or cell icon. It is also possible
to set parameters including glycan epitope (Kawasaki et al.,
2006). On the other hand, the ‘mass spectrometry-based glycan
searching’ is a way to look for a speciﬁc glycan information from

a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). If the users input the experimental
mass value (m/z), the program enables the users to gather the
possible glycan structures and organs. In addition, the XDB
allows users to set a mass tolerance that can be specified in
Daltons :l: of the measured value to avert no search result
found because of instrumental variations. The users can also
narrow down the list of the glycans by specifying several factors.
It includes the followings: mass spectrometry instrument, glycan
derivatization method, glycan type, ion mode, ion adducts and
origin, but it will be updated continuously.

The search result from XDB contains mass value (m/z), deri-
vatization, glycan type, structure, antigen, quantity and origin.
The mass value is an experimental value of the corresponding
glycan mass (mono-isotopic) analyzed using matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-ﬁight mass spectrometry or elec-
trospray ionization mass spectrometry. The derivatization indi-
cates the chemical derivatization for glycan analysis using mass
spectrometry. All the glycans in the XDB are classiﬁed into three
types: N—linked glycans (at the side chain of Asn), O-linked gly-
cans (at the Ser/Thr residues) in glycoproteins and glycosphin-
golipid-derived glycans. Especially, the a-galactosylatedglycans
are labeled with ‘a-Gal antigen’ in the column of ‘Antigen
type’. The chemical structures were drawn with Oxford glycan
nomenclature (Harvey et al., 2009). The relative quantity of
glycans, which was measured by NP-HPLC or quantitative MS
analysis, was incorporated in the result table as well.
Additionally, pie graphs represent the relative quantities of
each type of glycans (e.g. high-mannose glycans, a-Gal glycans,
sialylatedglycans and so on).

Although many of the well-established glycan databases offer
the detailed glycan structures, it is difﬁcult to solely collect the
pig glycans according to the speciﬁc organ or cell, which is a
promising candidate for xenotransplantation. Therefore, we

have built a unique and specialized database to provide reliable
information on glycans, which are derived from tissues and
cells of pigs. Moreover, it contains both qualitative and quanti-
tative information on xenoantigenic glycans, which play an im-
portant role in immune-rejection response. Taken together,
this database is potentially promising and facilitates xenotrans-
plantation research as well as basic carbohydrate research. The
XDB will allow users to use hyperlink the human glycan data-
base with CFG, which contains glycan proﬁles in human cells
and tissues for pig-to-human xenotransplantation research. In
the near future, this XDB will be updated with a list of glycans
from a1,3- galactosyltransferase gene-knock out pig samples
as well.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Earlier studies of protein structure revealed closed
loops with a characteristic size 25—30 residues and ring-like
shape as a basic universal structural element of globular proteins.
Elementary functional loops (EFLs) have specific signatures and
provide functional residues important for binding/activation and
principal chemical transformation steps of the enzymatic reaction.
The goal of this work is to show how these functional loops evolved
from pre-domain peptides and to find a set of prototypes from which
the EFLs of contemporary proteins originated.

Results: This article describes a computational method for deriving
prototypes of EFLs based on the sequences of complete genomes.
The procedure comprises the iterative derivation of sequence profiles
followed by their hierarchical clustering. The scoring function takes
into account information content on profile positions, thus preserving
the signature. The statistical significance of scores is evaluated from
the empirical distribution of scores of the background model. A set
of prototypes of EFLs from archaeal proteomes is derived. This set
delineates evolutionary connections between major functions and
illuminates how folds and functions emerged in pre-domain evolution
as a combination of prototypes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Enzymes are involved in all processes in living organisms. Well
before the ﬁrst protein sequence and structure were determined
(Sanger, 1952), the function of enzymes became one of the central
questions in biochemical studies. Despite the wealth of experimental
data available nowadays, the functions of the majority of proteins
are still uncharacterized (Levitt, 2009). Since the presence of certain
biochemical activities is typically sought for, while all other possible
activities (e.g. promiscuous functions) are ignored (Furnham et al.,
2009), experimental determination of enzymatic function is in most
cases conﬁrmative. Besides, biochemical assays are expensive,
are subject to in vitro experimental conditions, and they can
not be run on a genomic scale. All the above makes prediction
of enzymatic function with computational methods an important
alternative approach. There are several general assumptions on
which such methods are based: (i) homologous proteins have similar
functions; (ii) most of the functional variants emerged as a result
of divergence from a common ancestor; (iii) structural homologs,
so-called fold superfamilies, persist down to 25% of sequence
identity; (iv) divergence below 25% of sequence identity leads
to the emergence of families with different organism, substrate,
and/or tissue speciﬁcities (Lo Conte et al., 2000). Though enzymatic

function can be inferred by sequence and structure similarity, the
relations between sequence, structure and function are far from being
completely understood. Many folds display vast functional diversity.
For example, structurally similar B/or barrels provide scaffolds to
a number of biochemical functions (Nagano et al., 2002), while
particular biochemical functions can be performed by different
protein folds, e.g. hydrolase (Lo Conte et al., 2000).

The contemporary evolution of protein structure and function
takes place through mutations (Aharoni et al., 2005), recombination
and domain swapping and/or interactions (Chothia et al., 2003).
However, it is rather obvious that this process was preceded by
the emergence of a ﬁrst set of protein domain structures/folds
with a limited repertoire of biochemical functions. These structures
emerged from peptides with rudimentary non-speciﬁc catalytic
activities in the pre-domain stage of evolution (Lupas et al.,
2001). Understanding of this process is important for characterizing
the most ancient functions and their connections to the modern
proteins. The difﬁculties in understanding and, more importantly,
in predicting protein function, are well reﬂected in the diversity
of their descriptions. Enzymatic reactions are classiﬁed in
enzyme nomenclature (EC) by the biochemical transformation and
the substrate (Bairoch, 2000). According to MACiE database,
there could be different mechanisms employed for the same
transformation (Holliday et al., 2007, 2009). Different biochemical
reactions can have the same core mechanism, as it is exempliﬁed
by mechanistically diverse superfamilies (Glasner et al., 2006).
In order to reconcile different approaches and to develop a
generic description of enzymatic functions, one has to start from
considering their elementary units which provide binding/activation
and principal chemical transformation steps of the whole reaction.
Then it should be found out how combinations of these units result
in a variety of enzymatic reactions, and how protein folds restrict the
possibility of performing a particular biochemical transformation or
binding a certain substrate.

The ﬁrst question that arises in this context is what elements of
protein folds serve as elementary units of function. What were the
structures of these units in pre-domain evolution, and how did they
affect the structures of modern proteins? Earlier studies have shown
that soluble proteins contain a basic universal element, stemming
from the polymer nature of polypeptide chains, namely closed loops
or returns of the polypeptide chain backbone with a typical size
of 25—30 amino acid residues (Berezovsky and Trifonov, 2001;
Berezovsky et al., 2000). Any protein fold can be decomposed into
sets of consecutively connected closed loops (Berezovsky, 2003),
indicating their independence in the evolutionary past (Trifonov and
Berezovsky, 2003). Can we reconstruct the pre-biotic peptides that
gave rise to the elementary ﬁinctional units of modern proteins?
Our hypothesis is that a ﬁinctional signature revealing the type of

binding/activation or principal chemical transformation of the loop
can be obtained from the contemporary proteins. This signature
complements the description of the closed loop, hence it is an
elementary ﬁinctional loop (EFL). Therefore, the ﬁrst goal of this
study is to investigate how these ﬁinctional loops evolved from
pre-domain peptides, and to ﬁnd a set of prototypes from which
the EFLs of contemporary proteins originate. In order to draw a
picture of folds and functions emerging as combinations of EFLs,
prototypes of the EFLs will be derived and the corresponding EFLs
will be detected in proteins with known biochemical functions. The
presence of EFLs in distinct folds and ﬁinctions unravel evolutionary
relations between them and can hint on recipes for protein ﬁinction
(re)design.

The speciﬁc nature of prototypes calls for developing a new
computational procedure for their derivation and characterization.
Indeed, we seek for entities which do not exist in modern
proteins, but are represented by their descendants, EFLs. The
EFLs themselves presumably have low sequence identity to each
other, and, therefore, evolutionary connections between them
are not obvious. In this work, we propose a computational
procedure to derive prototypes of EFLs from the sequences of
complete proteomes. We expect these prototypes to be of closed-
loop size (25—30 residues), ring-like shape and to have distinct
ﬁinctional signatures, where several conserved positions in the
proﬁle describe chemically active amino acids which are involved
in binding/activation steps and/or take part in principal chemical
transformations of the substrate.

We illustrate our approach by reconstructing prototypes from
complete archaeal proteomes and analyzing connections between
ﬁinctions and folds found by the reconstructed prototypes. In
particular, we show examples for three characteristic cases:
(i) nucleotide—triphosphate binding and hydrolyzing loop, called
p-loop (Rossmann et al., 1974); (ii) a loop found in functionally
diverse proteins having B/or barrel fold; (iii) prototypes of two EFLs
involved into binding of ADP and glucose which form an enzymatic
domain in glycosyltransferases (glycogen synthase).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

We describe a computational method for deriving prototypes of EFLS
based on the sequences of complete genomes. The procedure comprises
the iterative derivation of sequence proﬁles followed by the hierarchical
clustering of proﬁles. We propose a scoring function that weights proﬁle
positions proportional to the information content on position. allowing
to discrimine between matches that carry a speciﬁc signature from non-
speciﬁc ones. The statistical signiﬁcance of the scores is calculated from the
empirical distribution of the reshufﬂed proﬁle scores used as a control. We
generalize the proﬁles and remove the remaining redundancies by clustering
the proﬁles. The distance measure used in clustering also takes into account
the information content on proﬁle positions.

2.1 Derivation of prototypes from complete proteomes

Complete sets of protein coding sequences of 68 archaeal organisms (listed
in Supplementary Material) are obtained from Genbank (Benson at al..
2009). We use one proteome representing each phylum of the archaeal
superkingdom to produce a set of origins for the prototype derivation
procedure. Proteomic sequences contain many sources of biases and
redundancies: (i) homologous proteins; (ii) domain swapping. recombination
and multiplication. These redundancies have to be removed. as they reﬂect
recent events in the evolution of proteins (Chothia at al.. 2003). The average

domain size is 8&150 residues (Gerstein. 1998; Jones at al.. 1998; Svedberg
1929; Wheelan at al.. 2000); therefore. in order to remove redundancy
originated from domain swapping. we compare 80-residue long sequence
segments for identity. Sequences are clustered with CD-HIT (Li and Godzik.
2006) several times to gradually remove redundancy between domains
down to 40% identity. Low-complexity regions in sequences which contain
repeats or have highly biased amino acid composition are masked with SEG
(Wootton and Federhen. 1996). Non-redundant domains are cut with 10-
residue steps into overlapping 50-residue segments. These segments contain
two lO-residue ﬂanks. which can be adjusted in order to obtain a ﬁnal 30-
residue prototype. Based on the observation that gaps are not distributed
uniformly. and multiple sequence alignments of remote homologs (below
25% sequence identity) contain well-aligned blocks without gaps (Kann
at al.. 2007) we consider that the cost of insertion or deletion in a functional
signature is higher compared to at an arbitrary position in the whole protein
sequence. therefore we do not allow gaps in proﬁles of EFLS.

The procedure starts from the search for sequences in the complete
archaeal proteomes that are most closely related to the initial sequence
segments (origins) in order to construct the seed alignment with a frequency
matrix constituting a proﬁle. The obtained proﬁles are then matched to the
complete proteomes again. in order to ﬁnd additional sequence matches and
to update the proﬁle. This proﬁle-sequence search is repeated until the proﬁle
no longer changes. and. therefore. considered converged (Supplementary
Figure S1). The proﬁles represent families of EFLS with speciﬁc signatures.
The iterative procedure allows a proﬁle to gradually expand to more
distantly related. but statistically signiﬁcant matches. Although the procedure
resembles PSI-BLAST (Altschul at al.. 1997). it has some notable differences
originating from the speciﬁc requirements of the prototype derivation task.
These differences are discussed in more detail in Supplementary Material.

2.2 Weighting of proﬁle positions by information

We calculate position speciﬁc scoring matrices (PSSM) to score the proﬁles
(for details of PSSM calculation see Supplementary Material). The proﬁle-
scoring function has to rank the matches according to the similarity of the
sequence segment to the signature of the proﬁle. An uneven contribution of
positions in the proﬁle should be taken into account. Degeneration of the
proﬁle towards the random compositional background or rare amino acids
because of overestimation of pseudocounts (Altschul at al.. 2009) should be
prevented. Decrease of the proﬁle sensitivity because of underestimation of
pseudocounts should also be avoided. Therefore. in order to discriminate
between matches that carry a speciﬁc signature from non-speciﬁc ones.
we weight positions proportional to KullbackiLeibler divergence (DKL)
(Kullback and Leibler. 1951). which reﬂects the information content on
position 1' relative to the random background:

p 20 f, _
D’KL=Z [ﬁJIng 
1'21 1

where f is observed amino acid frequencies on position i and c is proteomic
amino acid composition. The score of a sequence segment (1 to proﬁle PM)
will become:

1 ” .

1'21

where [migdeVMmjdW20 is the corresponding PSSM with n positions.
Proﬁle positions with low-information content (DKL <1 bit) are not
contributing to the overall score and are omitted.

2.3 Empirical calculation of the background

The signiﬁcance of a score is characterized by an E-Value. which is the
number of false positive or unrelated matches above this particular score.
The E-Value is evaluated by comparing distributions of scores of the proﬁle
(s) with scores of the reshufﬂed proﬁle (sR):E(s)=N],=N(1—ecdf(sR)).
where p is the P-Value. N is the size of the combined proteome and ecdf(sR)

is an empirical cumulative distribution function of the reshufﬂed proﬁle
scores. If. instead of the reshufﬂed proﬁle. a randomized proteome is used
as control. then all the biases except amino acid composition are lost.
resulting in overestimation of signiﬁcance of sequence matches containing
non-speciﬁc signals. Complete positional permutations destroying relative
distances between proﬁle positions. similar to the combinatorial problem of
pattern-avoiding permutations (Atkinson. 1999). give a robust estimation of
the E-Values (data not shown). Figure 1A shows an example of the score
distributions for a derived proﬁle and the reshufﬂed one. The difference
exists only in the right-most tail of the distributions. showing that there are
speciﬁc signatures in the proﬁle. and that they are destroyed by reshufﬂing.
All collected proﬁle matches with the E-Value below a certain signiﬁcance
threshold (e. g. E 5 1) are used to construct the updated proﬁle. A sample of
signiﬁcant matches of the p-loop prototype and the corresponding sequence
logo are shown in Figure 1B. Although the matches are found in proteins
with different biochemical function. they all possess nucleotide-binding
activity. which is presumably an elementary function of this prototype. It
is important to note that some of the proﬁle positions have much higher
information content than others. and these positions constitute the signature.
Comparison of all signiﬁcant sequence matches to the consensus shows that
the sequence identity is low on average and has a large variance (Fig. 1B
and C). Therefore. for proper E-Value estimation. i.e. for proper separation of
related matches from the unrelated ones. discrimination between informative
and non-informative positions is necessary.

2.4 Hierarchical clustering of converged proﬁles

The iterative procedure described above results in a set of converged proﬁles
that should be analyzed further. First. there is a redundancy between these
proﬁles. caused by the way the origins are obtained: they overlap with a
step of 10 residues. Redundancy also stems from the fact that different
origins can actually converge to the same or very similar proﬁles. It means
that these origins correspond to evolutionary connected EFLS. but their
similarity can only be detected with the help of the proﬁle. We introduce
a distance measure that takes into account all possible proﬁleiproﬁle
alignments in order to hierarchically cluster the proﬁles. Proﬁleiproﬁle
comparison is more sensitive (Panchenko. 2003) than proﬁle-sequence
comparison. thus more distant relations could be detected during proﬁle
clustering. This procedure results in the removal of redundancy and further
generalization of the proﬁles. The proﬁles with the most generic signatures
represent the functional characteristics of presumably original prototypes. All

possible proﬁleiproﬁle alignments without gaps are performed by sliding one
50-residue-long proﬁle [A]50 against the other proﬁle [A]50 and calculating
pair-wise positional distances between all possible 30-residue windows
[a]30 and [b]30. respectively. Distances between the pairs of corresponding
positions are weighted proportionally to the information at each position
(Dim):

 

30 20
d ([6430, [17130) = Z (D‘IQL+D,’§L) 2 (am- _ 1713].)2.
i2] 1'

The distance between two 50-residue proﬁles [A] 50 and [B] 50 is equal to the
minimal distance between all possible sliding windows of size 30:

D ([Also . [3150) = argmin [d ([also . [b130)],eA,,eB.

Hierarchical clustering of proﬁles is an iterative procedure where the most
similar proﬁles (min[D(A.B)]) are consecutively merged together. resulting
in a new. more generic proﬁle (Supplementary Figure S3).

2.5 Characterization of prototypes

We characterize prototypes by looking for sequence matches in crystallized
enzymes from ASTRAL/SCOP database (Brenner at al.. 2000; Lo Conte
at al.. 2000). These matches describe descendant EFLs that diverged from
the prototype. We assign elementary functions for derived prototypes and
determine characteristic positions in their signatures based on the known
enzymatic mechanisms in crystallized proteins.

Protein function is typically annotated by homology. although neither
high-sequence identity (<50%). nor low BLAST E-Values (below 10—50)
guarantee the conservation of biochemical function (Rost. 1999. 2002). Here
we annotate functional units of sub-domain size. Conventional homology
detection methods. which operate on the level of whole proteins or domains.
consider connections between SCOP superfamilies as false positives (Gough
at al.. 2001). It becomes obvious. that analysis of evolutionary relationships
on the level of functional closed loops requires a special approach (Andreeva
at al.. 2007; Fong and Marchler-Bauer. 2009; Xie and Bourne. 2008).
Although most of the derived prototypes (>70%. data not shown) have
matches in Pfam. Prosite and CDD. functional annotation can not be directly
transferred from the databases deﬁning the function on whole-protein or
domain level (Bateman at al.. 2004; Lo Conte at al.. 2000; Marchler-
Bauer. et al.. 2009; Sigrist at al.. 2010). resulting in ambiguous annotations.
and requiring additional manual curation. SCOP superfamilies can be used

as a reference of the function for crystallized protein domains. CDD and
Swissprot features can be used as more precise indicators of the elementary
function of EFLs. Other databases describe enzymatic function on the residue
level. For example. CSA (Gutteridge and Thornton. 2005). and MACiE
(Holliday at al.. 2007) databases describe experimentally determined roles of
functional residues in the biochemical reactions and its mechanisms. Thus.
Via sequences of the crystallized structures this annotation can be transferred
to the prototype’s signature.

2.6 Statistics

Non-redundant archaeal proteome has 20 X 106 sequence segments of length
50. Starting from 175 458 origins extracted from four archaeal organisms. we
end up with 8327 converged proﬁles having >100 matches in the archaeal
proteome and containing at least one position with four bits of information
in their signature. These proﬁles were clustered for 120 iterations. which
resulted in 138 proﬁles. from which the strongest 43 were selected for
further consideration. The resulting 43 proﬁles are considered to be the
most abundant ones and were used in the analysis. The ASTRAL sequence
database based on SCOP release 1.75 contains 16712 non-redundant
domains at 95% sequence identity.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We developed a computational procedure for deriving prototypes
of EFLs, obtained prototypes from the set of archaeal proteomes,
considered several prototypes in detail, delineated connections
between domains superfamilies using the most abundant prototypes,
and exempliﬁed how combinations of EFLs result in speciﬁc
enzymatic function.

Figure 2 shows several representatives of the p-loop prototype
and exempliﬁes detection of EFLs in different folds and biochemical
functions. The signature of the prototype reads G-X-X-G-X-G-K-
[TS] and is known to be the signature of nucleotide—triphosphate
binding (Rossmann et al., 1974). We show EFLs corresponding to

the prototype in four different proteins representing three different
folds (p-loop containing nucleoside hydrolase, PEP carboxykinase-
like fold, OsmC-like fold). Though sequence alignment of EFLs
reveals high conservation in key sequence positions, the rest of
the loop can diverge signiﬁcantly. The degree of divergence of
EFLs from the prototype is also indicated in the difference between
corresponding structural segments: in the hydrolase and PEP-
carboxykinase-like folds the structure resembles B-tum-or, while
in OsmC-like fold it resembles B-hairpin. It is important to note,
however, that despite the different structures of the EFL, naturally
affected by the rest of the fold (Minor and Kim, 1996), the functional
signature is always located in the elbow between the two elements of
secondary structure and is highly conserved. EFLs representing this
prototype universally provide the elementary function of nucleotide—
triphosphate binding via interaction with the phosphate groups and
with a Mg2+ ion, and also take part in phosphate hydrolysis. The
combination of a speciﬁc sequence signature with its structural
location emphasizes the conservation of the closed-loop structure,
regardless of the exact secondary structural content of the loop
and interaction of this loop with its structural environment. The
diversity of folds containing this loop suggests that in the pre-
domain stage of protein evolution the prototype of the p-loop
was included into structurally and biochemically different folds,
acquiring different elements of secondary structure and mutations
in sequences, but preserving the active residues and their relative
locations in sequence and space. The fourth structure in Figure 2 is
a protein from V. cholerae with unknown function. With the help
of the prototype it is now possible to hypothesize the ﬁinction of
this protein to a certain extent. It could be predicted, for example,
that this V. cholerae protein has a nucleotide—triphosphate binding,
and, perhaps, hydrolyzing activity. The combination with other EFLs
detected in this protein can complete description of its possible
biochemical function.

Figure 3 shows proteins that share the same B/or-barrel fold, which,
in turn, has >30 superfamilies in SCOP. This fold also serves as a
scaffold for a variety of functions (Nagano et al., 2002), therefore

Fig. 4. Protein functions connected by prototypes of EFLs. Red diamonds represent prototypes and blue ovals represent protein domain superfamilies with the
corresponding SCOP superfamily names. Edges are matches detected in the non-redundant sequences of protein domains. Thickness of edges characterizes

the number of matches found.

the fold is an important target in protein (re)design experiments
(Bershtein and Tawﬁk, 2008; Tokuriki and Tawﬁk, 2009). Based
on the derived prototypes, B/or-barrels can be decomposed into
a set of B-turn-or subunits, some of these subunits are directly
involved in catalysis and, therefore, carry the functional signatures.
The Glycine-rich prototype (Fig. 3) is an illustration of ﬁinctional
connections in an abundant B/oc-barrel fold. The structure of the
loops is B-turn—or, and the ﬁinctionally important residues are located
in the turn. The elementary function of the Glycine-rich pre-
domain prototype is related to redox reactions revealing evolutionary
connection between B/or barrels with different enzymatic ﬁinctions.
The biochemical ﬁinctions of the enzymes where the loop is
found are typically various oxidoreductases, dehydrogenases and
synthases.

A set of abundant prototypes derived on the archaeal proteomes
is used to delineate evolutionary connections between ﬁinctional
superfamilies of structural domains. Figure 4 illustrates connections
revealed by a subset of the strongest prototypes (43 prototypes)
in form of a graph. Nodes are prototypes (red diamonds)
and protein domain superfamilies (blue ovals) according to
SCOP classiﬁcation. The edges represent matches between the
superfamilies and the prototypes, where thickness of an edge
is proportional to the logarithm of the number of matches
found in the non-redundant set of protein domains derived
from ASTRAL/SCOP database (Brenner et al., 2000; Lo Conte
et al., 2000). Since a non-redundant set of protein domains
was used in analysis, thickness is a rough indicator of the
diversity of proteins in the superfamily. Each prototype is
referred to by its number (numbers in red diamonds) and has a
ﬁinctional signature represented in form of a sequence proﬁle. The
logos of the corresponding proﬁles are listed in Supplementary
Material.

The ﬁinctional connections exempliﬁed by the p-loop prototype
and Glycine-rich prototype can be seen here in a larger context
of archaeal (and homologous to archaeal) domains. The Glycine-
rich prototype (Fig. 3) with the number 8 in the graph has ﬁve
connections to folds other than B/oc-barrel fold: NAD(P)—binding
Rossmann fold, Activating enzymes of the Ubiquitin—like proteins,
PreATP—grasp domain, Nucleotide-binding domain, FAD/NAD(P)-
binding domain. Since all these folds have nucleotide—phosphate
binding in common, these connections suggest that the elementary
function of prototype 8 is related to nucleotide—phosphate binding.
As a result, functional connections inside the B/oc-barrel fold as
well as connections between the B/or-barrel and other folds are
found, unraveling nucleotide—phosphate binding as one of basic
elementary functions crucial in the emergence of folds. Another
interesting case is a p—loop containing nucleoside triphosphate
hydrolase considered earlier (Fig. 2) which is an example of a fold
with different biochemical functions. The particular biochemical
function, in turn, is determined by the unique combination of EFLs,
which is reﬂected as a group of prototypes gathered around the
superfamily and connected by thick edges. One of the prototypes
around the superfamily is prototype 1603, considered earlier (Fig. 2).
The connection between p—loop containing nucleoside triphosphate
hydrolase and PEP carboxykinase—like folds Via p—loop prototype
(Fig. 2) indicates that p-loop as EFL is an essential functional
element of enzymes belonging to different superfamilies with
different folds. It also suggests an important role of prototype 1603
in pre-domain evolution of folds and superfamilies. Some prototypes
are present in a variety of superfamilies. For example, the Cysteine-
rich metal binding loop (number 1845) which corresponds to EFLs
forming a nest with cysteines co-ordinating a metal ion (typically
Zn2+) facilitating nucleic acid binding. These EFLs are present in
various superfamilies mainly related to nucleic acid binding, which

is reﬂected in the graph by edges connecting prototype 1845 to
thirteen superfamilies.

By representing proteins folds and ﬁinctions in form of a
graph connected by the prototypes one can proceed to explore
the emergence of protein functions as combinations of prototypes.
We illustrate how a functional domain emerges as combination
of prototypes by the example of Glycosyltransferase superfamily
(orange oval in Fig. 4). Figure 5 shows glycogen synthase
(PDB 1rzu), which catalyzes the elongation of alpha-1,4-glucose
backbone. The enzyme binds ADP-glucose and [Glucose],,_1 as
substrates and transfers glycosyl group to form [Glucose],, as
product and ADP. One of the enzyme’s domains contains the EFLs
corresponding to sequence prototypes 3054 (cyan) and 7009 (red).
The elementary chemical ﬁinctions of the prototypes are assigned
according to the description of interactions with co-crystallized
ligands analogous to the products and the substrates of the enzyme
(Buschiazzo et al., 2004; Sheng et al., 2009). The elementary
ﬁinction of prototype 3054 is ADP binding: Arg-299 and Lys-304
interact with the phosphate, Ile-297 (second in position of 3054’s
PSSM) with the base and Ser—298 (third in 3054’s PSSM) with the
sugar in ADP. Prototype 7009 is also involved in ADP binding,
its characteristic elementary function is glucose binding: Glu-376
interacts with phosphate and Thr-381 (third in 7009’s PSSM) with
the base of ADP. Besides, residue Glu-376 also plays an important
catalytic role in glycosyltransferase activity. Finally, these two
prototypes also interact with each other, forming a stabilizing salt
bridge between Lys-304 and Glu-376. This example shows how
the emergence of enzymatic ﬁinction can be explored based on
signatures of the prototypes and their elementary chemical functions.
The two-domain nature of glycosyltransferase also points out that
analysis of individual folds and their enzymatic functions should
be followed by the exploration of recombination events in case of
multi-domain proteins.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The existence of EFLs in different folds and functions makes it
possible to survey subtle evolutionary relations, originating from
the pre-domain evolution of protein structure. It suggests that
contemporary enzymatic functions are constructs of different sets

and combinations of elementary chemical functions. It also shows
that most of the enzymatic functions are performed by abundant
prototypes (e.g. p-loop and Cysteine-containing prototype), which
provide common reaction steps of different ﬁinctions existing in
different folds. An exhaustive description of a protein fold and
its enzymatic function as a combination of EFLs illuminates how
this fold emerged in pre-domain evolution by fusion of prototype
genes. Therefore, obtaining the full collection of prototypes
with elementary functions will make it possible to (i) predict
enzymatic functions based on the sequences via determining EFLs
corresponding to prototypes and their relative positions revealing
structure of the fold; (ii) (re)design folds with desired ﬁinctions by
building constructs from necessary EFLs.

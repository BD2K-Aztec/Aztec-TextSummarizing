ABSTRACT

Summary: MaxLink, a guilt-by-association network search algorithm,
has been made available as a web resource and a stand-alone
version. Based on a user-supplied list of query genes, MaxLink iden-
tifies and ranks genes that are tightly linked to the query list. This
functionality can be used to predict potential disease genes from an
initial set of genes with known association to a disease. The original
algorithm, used to identify and rank novel genes potentially involved in
cancer, has been updated to use a more statistically sound method for
selection of candidate genes and made applicable to other areas than
cancer. The algorithm has also been made faster by re-implementa-
tion in C++, and the Web site uses FunCoup 3.0 as the underlying
network.

Availability and implementation: MaxLink is freely available at http://
maxlink.sbc.su.se both as a web service and a stand-alone application
for download.

1 INTRODUCTION

The vast amount of gene and protein interaction data emanating
from high-throughput experiments have been skillfully compiled
into networks of functional associations, such as FunCoup
(Schmitt et al., 2014). These networks combine information on
different types of proteinigene interactions from different
species, data sources and data types to achieve a much higher
quality and interaction coverage than pure proteiniprotein inter-
action networks. Owing to their high coverage, such networks
have a high potential of yielding predictions about previously
un-annotated gene function(s) and/or disease associations,
through ‘guilt-by—association’ (GBA), i.e. assuming related func-
tions of network neighbors (Lee et al., 2011).

MaxLink (Ostlund et al., 2010) applies a GBA algorithm to
search the FunCoup network to identify and rank genes enriched
in connections to a seed set of known disease genes. In the
original implementation, the algorithm was tested and validated
on a set of cancer genes. The new version of MaxLink has been
implemented as a web resource and has been further generalized

to identify and rank potential disease genes of any disease or
condition where a seed set of implicated genes can be provided.

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND FEATURES

The original MaxLink Perl program has been re-implemented in
C+ +, using the Boost library (http://www.boost.org/), for
increased performance and a more general framework.

The new MaxLink implementation takes as input a list of
genes, i.e. known to be involved in a particular disease or con-
dition. The web service is run using default or user-speciﬁed
values for the following parameters: ‘Query network’ (default:
Homo sapiensFone of the 11 currently available model organ-
ism networks in FunCoup 3.0 (Schmitt et al., 2014); ‘Network
conﬁdence threshold’ (default: 0.75%a conﬁdence threshold for
the links in the underlying network, known as pfc in FunCoup
(Alexeyenko et al., 2011);and the ‘Hypergeometric Cutoff’
(default 0.1Fa hypergeometric probability cutoff to ensure
that identified genes are statistically enriched in connections to
the query set. These parameters can be altered according to user
guidelines found at the MaxLink Web site. After searching the
FunCoup network, a list of candidate genes is returned. The list
is sorted by the connectivity to the query list (MaxLink score).
The resulting list can also be Visualized using quuid (Klammer
et al., 2008) in the context of the searched FunCoup network
(Fig. 1). As an example query, we used the nine breast cancer
genes from the COSMIC cancer gene census database (Forbes
et al., 2011) with the highest number of network links. Running
MaxLink with the example query returns the set of genes most
strongly associated to the query set in the context of the under-
lying Funcoup network.

The original implementation used a connectivity filter to only
retain the genes with proportionally more connections to the
query set than to other genes. Doing this avoided highly connected
genes from being automatically counted as potential candidates
solely based on their high number of interactions. In the new
version, a statistically more sound approach has been imple-
mented by calculating a hypergeometric probability score for
each potential candidate based on its interactions with the query
set and in total. Only candidates with a score below a cutoff are
kept. This approach has been validated (Supplementary Material)
on a set of rare disease genes from Orphanet (Aymé, 2003).

In the original implementation, an ‘annotation filter’ was
applied to remove genes having annotations to cancer, as only

Fig. 1. j Squid graph of an example run of MaxLink, using default param-
eters and breast cancer genes from the COSMIC database (diamonds) as
query. The genes identiﬁed by Maxlink in the FunCoup 3.0 network are
signiﬁcantly enriched (P < 0.1) in links to the query set, and thus predicted
to be functionally important in breast cancer

novel potential cancer genes were of interest. This ﬁlter was
removed in the new implementation to generalize the search to
areas other than cancer. We here validate the new MaxLink on a
set of genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (Supplementary
Material) from the AlzGene database (Bertram et al., 2007).

3 DISCUSSION

MaxLink, a network prioritization algorithm for genes, identi-
ﬁed based on interactions with a seed set, has been improved by a
statistically more sound speciﬁcity filtering. It is now released as
a much faster C-l-+ implementation, applicable to any set of
seed genes, and available as an easy-to-use web resource. The
tool can be used in general biological and applied biomedical
research, e. g. prediction of potential disease genes, prioritization
and/or analysis of results from GWAS/linkage studies.

Other tools exist for candidate gene prioritization, many of
which are collected at the Gene Prioritization Portal
(Tranchevent et al., 2011). These tools use various strategies,
e. g. text mining (Gonzalez et al., 2008) or functional annotation
analysis (Liekens et al., 2011), and data sources, e.g. gene expres-
sion (van Dam et al., 2012) and PPI networks (Kohler et al.,
2008). Most of the tools require a distinct region of the genome
as input (Seelow et al., 2008) to narrow down the search space. In
contrast, MaxLink prioritizes genes from the whole genome,
applying a unique GBA algorithm to FunCoup that integrates
information on several types of protein and gene associations
from many species and data sources, and is one of the most
comprehensive networks available. Furthermore, many of the
tools use keywords as input, as opposed to MaxLink, which
only uses gene sets. Gene set-based tools have been shown to
perform better than keyword-based ones (Bornigen et al., 2012).
Performance in general is, however, heavily dependent on the

selection of evaluation datasets (Csermely et al., 2013), but
tools relying on more comprehensive data integration appear
to be more powerful (Bornigen et al., 2012). Performance bench-
marking remains non-triVial owing to the diversity of the ways
the tools are to be used, lack of solid experimental validation and
knowledge contamination when statistical methods such as
cross-validation are used (Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012).

A future extension of MaxLink could be to use other functional
networks than FunCoup, to evaluate the algorithm on different
data. This could also provide an even wider coverage of potential
geneiprotein functional interaction space. Furthermore, search
methods such as shortest path (Peyer et al., 2009) or PageRank
(Erin and Page, 1998) could be implemented to exploit other topo-
logical properties of the network and to test the suitability of dif-
ferent types of search methods and queries.

Abstract

Summary: Accurate topology prediction of transmembrane [f—barrels is still an open question.
Here, we present BOCTOPUSZ, an improved topology prediction method for transmembrane
[f—barrels that can also identify the barrel domain, predict the topology and identify the orientation
of residues in transmembrane [f—strands. The major novelty of BOCTOPUSZ is the use of the
dyad—repeat pattern of lipid and pore facing residues observed in transmembrane [f—barrels. In a
cross—validation test on a benchmark set of 42 proteins, BOCTOPUSZ predicts the correct topology
in 69% of the proteins, an improvement of more than 10% over the best earlier method
(BOCTOPUS) and in addition, it produces significantly fewer erroneous predictions on non—

transmembrane [f—barrel proteins.

1 Introduction

Transmembrane [i-barrels (TMBs) are located in the outer membranes
of bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria and are involved in trans-
port of substrates across the cell membrane. Also, they are key com-
ponents of translocation complexes. Bacterial TMBs consist of an
even number of anti-parallel [ﬁ-strands that are surrounded by long
outer-loops and short inner-loops. Eukaryotic TMBs can have an odd
number of strands. The residues located in transmembrane [i-strands
follow a dyad-repeat pattern, where alternating residues face the lipids
and the pore region (Wimley, 2003), respectively. BOCTOPUS
(Hayat and Elofsson, 2012), a previously published two-stage TMB
topology predictor, did not predict the lipid/pore-facing orientation of
residues in the transmembrane [ﬁ-strands but BOCTOPUSZ does. The
use of this information improves topology predictions.

2 Methods

Forty-two TMB sequences, culled at 20% sequence identity using the
PISCES server (Wang and Dunbrack, 2005) are divided into 10 sub-
sets for cross-validation (Supplementary Table 51). To ensure that no
homology information is used, all proteins from the same super-fam-
ily are put into the same cross-validation group. Membrane bounda-
ries, 3D structures and super-family classification are obtained from
the OPM database (Lomize et (11., 2006). Residues in the transmem-
brane strands are labelled as pore or lipid-facing based on their side-
chain orientation relative to the barrel center. In addition, a dataset
(also reduced to 20% sequence identity) consisting of 370 (28 eukary-
otic and 342 prokaryotic) known TMBs and 7558 non-TMBs that
contain a signal peptide was downloaded from Uniprot (Consortium
et (11., 2015).

4 Conclusions

We present BOCTOPUS2, an improved topology predictor for
TMBs that exploits the dyad—repeat feature of bacterial TMBs to
identify transmembrane ﬁ—strands. BOCTOPUS2 can also identify
the transmembrane barrel domain in long sequences and predict the
correct topology in ~69% proteins in our dataset. Further,
BOCTOPUS2 predicts the lipid—facing or pore—facing status of resi—
dues in identified ﬁ—strands. We have recently shown that accurate
topology and residue—orientation prediction is beneficial for 3D
modelling of TMBS (Hayat et al., 2015).

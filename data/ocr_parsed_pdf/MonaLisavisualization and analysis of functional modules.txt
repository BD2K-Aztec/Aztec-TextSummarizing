ABSTRACT

Summary: Structural modeling of biochemical networks enables
qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of those networks.
Automated network decomposition into functional modules is a crucial
point in network analysis. Although there exist approaches for the
analysis of networks, there is no open source tool available that com-
bines editing, visualization and the computation of steady-state func-
tional modules. We introduce a new tool called MonaLisa, which
combines computation and visualization of functional modules as
well as an editor for biochemical Petri nets. The analysis techniques
allow for network decomposition into functional modules, for example
t-invariants (elementary modes), maximal common transition sets,
minimal cut sets and t-clusters. The graphical user interface provides
various functionalities to construct and modify networks as well as to
visualize the results of the analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

The development of powerful experimental high-throughput
technologies supports the development of large-scale biochemical
network models with hundreds to several thousands of reactions.
However, because detailed kinetic data are often incomplete,
structural and stoichiometric properties become critically import-
ant for the analysis and validation of these networks.

Various Visualization and/or analysis tools for biochemical
hypergraphs as well as bipartite graphs have been developed,
such as CellDesigner (Funahashi et al., 2003), COPASI (Hoops
et al., 2006), Vanted (Junker et al., 2006), Cytoscape (Cline et al.,
2007), CellIllustrator (Nagasaki et al., 2011) and Snoopy (Fieber,
2004).

The Petri net (PN) formalism (Reisig, 1986) implements
bipartite, directed graphs and provides a rich variety of rigorous
analysis methods. In the past decades, PN has been applied to
various biochemical systems, for example to signal transduction
pathways, gene regulatory networks and metabolic models; for
an overview see Koch et a]. (2011).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Functional modules at steady state have been deﬁned in
several concepts, such as transition and place invariants (t-invari-
ants and p-invariants) (Lautenbach, 1973), elementary modes,
(Schuster and Hilgetag, 1994), minimal cut sets (MCS; Klamt
and Gilles, 2004), enzyme subsets (Pfeiffer et al., 1999), maximal
common transition sets (MCT-sets; Sackmann et al., 2006) and
transition clusters (t-clusters; Grafahrend-Belau et al., 2008).
Because the number of invariants exponentially grows up to
millions, the computation and evaluation of all invariants is
still a challenging task.

There exist tools for the automated detection of functional
modules, but none of them comprises so many concepts and
provides a suitable Visualization combined with a graphical
editor. We want to ﬁll this gap by providing an open source
tool for functional analysis without prior knowledge of detailed
kinetic data.

MonaLisa is partly based on earlier implementations in PInA
(Grafahrend—Belau et al., 2008) and TInA (Thormann et al.,
2009).

2 FEATURES

MonaLisa implements a PN editor with numerous functions for
creating, removing, moving, zooming, coloring and labeling of
objects as well as several network decomposition techniques,
including the graphical Visualization of the resulting functional
modules (Fig. 1). We also provide a knockout analysis (single,
double, and multi knockout), i.e. the set of reactions that are
inactive in the case of a knockout of a particular reaction
(Grunwald et al., 2008), and furthermore the computation of
general topological features, e.g. the distribution of vertex
degrees and cluster coefﬁcients.

MonaLisa implements the following network decomposition
techniques: (i) t- and p-invariants, i.e. the minimal sets of reac-
tions at steady state and the minimal sets of places whose sub-
stance sum is always constant; (ii) MCSs, i.e. the sets of reactions
whose inactivation inhibits a certain function; (iii) MCT-sets, i.e.
the sets of reactions that exclusively occur in the same t-invari-
ants; and (4) t-clusters, i.e. the sets of reactions that describe a
speciﬁc biological function.

MonaLisa supports the PN-based ﬁle formats PNML
(Petri Net Markup Language; Billington et al., 2003), PNT
(Petri Net Technology; Starke, 1997), SPPED (Fieber, 2004),
the biological ﬁle formats SBML (Systems Biology Markup
Language; Finney and Hucka, 2003), KGML (KEGG Markup
Language), DAT (Metatool format; Kamp and Schuster, 2006)

the PN model in different formats. The NetViewer (middle part) depicts the PN model of the carbon metabolism of the sucrose breakdown pathway in
potato tubers (Koch et al., 2005). The metabolites (places) are drawn as circles and the reactions (transitions) as rectangles. The gray-ﬁlled circles indicate
logical places, e.g. PP or UDP. The red color highlights a functional module deﬁned by the reactions of a t-invariant, including their pre- and post-places

and the edges in between. The right part shows results of t-invariant analysis

and the image ﬁle formats Portable Network Graphics (PNG)

3 SUMMARY

MonaLisa is an open-source tool for modeling biochemical net-
works without any knowledge of kinetic parameters. It is based
on the PN formalism and focuses on decomposition methods to
identify functional modules at steady state. As t-invariants
correspond to elementary modes, the tool can also be applied
to elementary mode analysis. Besides network Visualization and
editing, it enables a Visual inspection of the analysis results.
Furthermore, MonaLisa implements interfaces to many tools
in systems biology, PN world and graph-theory.

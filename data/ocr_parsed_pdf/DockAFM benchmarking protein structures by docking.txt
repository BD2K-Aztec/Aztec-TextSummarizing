ABSTRACT

Summary: Proteins can adopt a variety of conformations. We present
a simple server for scoring the agreement between 3D atomic struc-
tures and experimental envelopes obtained by atomic force micros-
copy. Three different structures of immunoglobulins (lgG) or blood
coagulation factor V activated were tested and their agreement with
several topographical surfaces was computed. This approach can be
used to test structural variability within a family of proteins.

1 BACKGROUND

A new family of microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM),
enables the probing of the surface of a single molecule in physio-
logical conditions using a sharp nanoscopic tip (Binnig et al.,
1986). Essentially, an AFM height image of a single molecule
represents the surface topography of that molecule. AFM ima-
ging yields 2D images with an exceptional signal/noise ratio that
allows the observation of single molecules at a lateral resolution
of nanometers and a vertical resolution of angstrom (Ido et al.,
2013; Schabert et al., 1995). AFM has intrinsic advantages when
applied to large proteins, which are difficult to study by trad-
itional techniques (Schroder et al., 2010; Trinh et al., 2012).
AFM can handle imaging in liquid compared with the frozen
or crystallized state in electronic microscopy (EM) and X-ray
diffraction, respectively. In addition, AFM does not rely on sym-
metry averaging as in traditional EM or on physical averaging as
in crystallized sample (Fechner et al., 2009).

AFM imaging allows the observation of the conformational
dynamics of single molecules such as membrane proteins (Colom
et al., 2012; Scheuring et al., 1999), nucleic acids (Ido et al., 2013;
Witz et al., 2011) and on antibodies (Chaves et al., 2013). Such
dynamics is also recently observed with high-speed AFM (Ando
et al., 2007; Casuso et al., 2012). Thus, it is possible to distinguish
putative conformational states of single proteins for instance.
However, despite the exceptional signal/noise ratio of high-
resolution AFM images, it is not straightforward to interpret
atomic changes in AFM images (Chen et al., 2013).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The DockAFM tool establishes a link between topographic
images from AFM and molecular dynamics of single proteins.
DockAFM computes the ﬁt of input conformations of a mol-
ecule with the topographic surface of AFM images. Thus,
DockAFM can be used to benchmark protein 3D structures or
models against an experimental data obtained by atomic force
microscopy. DockAFM uses a real-space description of atoms
and surfaces and has been developed as the ﬁrst step to assemble
large macromolecules using their individual constituent (Chaves
et al., 2013; Trinh et al., 2012) and AFM images.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

DockAFM uses DOT 2.0 (Roberts et al., 2013) that has demon-
strated useful applications on studying proteiniprotein inter-
actions (Roberts and Pique, 1999) and protein-DNA (Fan and
Roberts, 2006). DOT 2.0 allows different grid spacing in the
three dimensions. It is well adapted to AFM images using a
grid spacing in XY nplane of 10A and an improved grid spacing
in Z—direction of 1A.

A typical DockAFM run takes 5 min on the server (64 matrix
side). Optionally, DockAFM can erode the AFM image to cor-
rect for tip shape artifact but the user must enter appropriate tip
shape values (usually taken from the manufacturer). The AFM
image is then transformed into favorable and forbidden layers.
The docking is performed at a constant null electrostatic poten-
tial so that only DOT van der Waals interactions is counted for
atoms residing inside the favorable region. Thus, the top ranking
solution has the minimum energy that corresponds to the max-
imum number of atoms located within the favorable layer
beneath the AFM surface.

Upon completion of the calculation, the server generates and
returns the lowest energy conformation in a Protein Data Bank
(PDB) ﬁle and a ranked list of 10000 docking possibilities that
can be received either by email or by downloading the results in a
zip file. A good docking is obtained when the largest number of
atoms is fitted within the favorable layer and when most of top
docking orientations are clustered in the topographic surface.

3 RESULTS

Two examples are presented in Figure 1. In the ﬁrst case, AFM
images of single molecules of antibodies were obtained. The
question asked to DockAFM server was to show which known
3D structures of complete antibodies (PDB codes for T—shape:
lIGT, Y-shape: lIGY or intermediate: 1HZH) fit better the
AFM images. In the second case, AFM image of human
blood coagulation factor V activated (FVa) was obtained.

Fig. 1. DockAFM test cases: immunoglobulin (IgG) and activated blood
coagulation factor V (FVa): (a) AFM images of IgG (left) and FVa
(right) show each individual topographic surface used for running
DockAFM (b) AFM topographic surfaces used for docking protein
structures are shown in gray scale as well as three different docked struc-
tures are shown for both IgG and FVa systems (bottom side view) (c) For
each system, the docking score as well as the shift of the docked structure
from the center of the topographic surface are shown. The most favorable
structure is chosen as that having the smallest shift from the center.
Counting most favorable structures is used for the benchmarking purpose
of DockAFM

Because no complete structure of FVa exists, the question asked to
DockAFM is to show which of the three available model of FVa
ﬁts better the AFM image. The three models used for FVa are a
comparative model, 1FV4 (Pellequer et al., 2000), a partial crystal
structure, lSDD (Adams et al., 2004) and a more recent com-
pleted FVa model, which uses the C domains orientations accord-
ing to the partial crystal structure, FVa (Gale et al., 2007).

Both AFM images (Fig. 1a) were obtained on a multimode V
microscope using the PeakForce tapping mode in air (Bruker,
AXS). The IgG image was scaled four times by linear interpol-
ation to a resolution of 4.9 A/px using Gwyddion, whereas the
FVa image was used at the raw resolution of 9.75 A/px. For
the docking, a cubic matrix of 64 nodes with a step of 4.9A
and a favorable layer of 12A was used for IgG, whereas a
cubic matrix of 32 nodes with a step of 9.75A and a favorable
layer of 20A was used for FVa. Among the multiple individual
molecules on the AFM images, several were cropped and
selected. Each tested structure was docked individually in each
crop image. Results for a single crop in both molecular systems
are shown in Figure 1b, full information is available in
Supplementary Material (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2).

The output of DockAFM is indicated in Figure 1c. For each
crop and for each structure, docking energy and the offset rela-
tive to the center is given. Best docking solutions are highlighted
in yellow (ﬁrst column). Docking solutions having acceptable
offsets are highlighted in cyan (second column), i.e. those with
a maximum deviation between the center of the docked molecule
and that of the topographic image was <25% of the image lateral

size. Finally, the most probable ﬁtted structures are highlighted
in green (third column) and correspond to those having the
lowest energy with well centering into the topographic surface.
In the two cases presented here, the structure lIGT is the most
probable conformation found in the IgG image, whereas the
model 1FV4 ﬁts better the FVa AFM image.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The DockAFM server is a tool for docking 3D structures under
AFM surfaces. It can be used to benchmark alternative 3D
structures or models against experimental data.

Addressing the question of sequencing depth requires (i) deﬁn—
ing a statistical criterion that can quantify the information
loss of an experiment because of its apparent sequencing
depth and (ii) determining the sequencing depth needed to con—
trol the information loss based on a pilot, possibly under—
sequenced, dataset. From a statistical point of view, ChIP—seq
peak calling procedures can be cast as multiple testing problems
because they aim to assess whether data for each candidate
locus is supported by the background noise distribution or the
ChIP signal. Therefore, the information loss is naturally con—
nected to the concept of the testing power. As a result, both
of the aforementioned issues can be considered within a power
calculation framework where the sequencing depth plays the role
of sample size.

Power computations require modeling distribution of both the
background reads and ChIP signal in a way that reﬂects the
stochastic nature of read accumulation at each genomic locus
as a function of sequencing depth. Although a number of
models were proposed for locus—speciﬁc read counts, none of
them explicitly accounted for read accumulation. Zhang et a].
(2008) and Ji et a]. (2008) considered models with locally Poisson
distributed background and did not model ChIP signal. Kuan
et a]. (2011) proposed a ﬂexible model taking into account the
genome structure and overdispersion. However, this model used
the input sample as a covariate and did not explicitly parametrize
the model in terms of sequencing depths. Zhang et a]. (2011)
proposed a hierarchical Bayesian t—mixture model to identify
local concentration of directional reads, but did not consider
the relationship between read accumulation and sequencing
depth. Xu et a]. (2010) adopted a signal—to—noise model, para—
meters of which followed some arbitrary prior distribution to
account for intrinsic read bias. Although such a prior distribu—
tion, if estimated, could be utilized to model the background
distribution at varying sequencing depths, the work of Xu
et a]. (2010) exclusively focused on the normalization aspect of
ChIP—seq analysis.

We developed CSSP (ChIP—seq Statistical Power) framework
for statistical power calculation by considering a local Poisson
model for the read generation process. We assume that back—
ground reads in the ChIP and the input samples are generated
by local Poisson processes with shared Gamma prior distribu—
tions. The corresponding Gamma parameters are modeled as
functions of the local genome structure, including mappability
and GC content. The local Poisson parameters for the enrich—
ment signals follow convolution of Gamma distributions. This
model preserves the local structure of the Xu et a]. (2010) model
while keeping the negative binomial distribution as the marginal
signal distribution as in Kuan et a]. (201 1). Such a local structure
is key for capturing dynamics of the counting process for indi—
vidual genomic locus as a result of increasing sequencing depths.
We introduce a conditional power deﬁnition that uses the prac—
tically used notion of fold change of ChIP signal over the control
input sample. We show with data—driven computational experi—
ments that our approach can be used to determine (i) the appar—
ent conditional power for a given sequencing depth; (ii) the
required sequencing depth to achieve a target power while con—
trolling the FDR at a speciﬁed level. Simulation experiments
based on a deeply sequenced Escherichia coli dataset indicate
that power predictions of our model agree well with the observed

empirical power. Using data from pilot studies, we can reliably
estimate power for larger sequencing depths; thus, the CSSP
framework has significant implications for designing ChIP—seq
experiments with the multiplexing functionality. Finally, we
study the power of multiple ENCODE datasets with varying
sequencing depths. Our results illustrate that, although the
power varies considerably with the signal—to—noise ratios of the
datasets, the current sequencing depths have high power for pro—
teiniDNA interactions with large effect sizes and are generally
adequate for smaller effect sizes. Our calculations are further
supported by the data quality metrics proposed by the
ENCODE project (Harrow et al., 2012).

2 METHOD
2.1 The CSSP framework

Our CSSP framework models read counts from ChIP-seq data as Poisson
processes with Gamma prior distributions. We assume that the uniquely
mapping reads of both the ChIP and the input samples are pre-processed
by the commonly adopted method of extension to the average fragment
length provided by the experimental design (Kuan et al., 2011; Rozowsky
et al., 2009). For modeling purposes, we divide the reference genome into
n non-overlapping intervals, e.g. bins as in Ji et a]. (2008), with sizes set to
the average fragment length. Let X,- and Y,- denote the number of ex-
tended input and ChIP sample reads overlapping the ith bin, respectively.
Let N V and N), denote the sequencing depths for input and ChIP samples.
We assume that X,- and Y,- follow Poisson distributions (Zhang et al.,
2008; Xu et al., 2010):

(X, | A?) ~ PoisUthx), (Y, | A?) ~ Poisﬂ'E’Ny), (l)

where if and  are bin-speciﬁc rate parameters for the input and ChIP
samples, satisfying E[Zilf] = 1 and E[Zil{] = 1, where the expect-
ations are with respect to the prior distributions that we introduce later
in the text. This formulation models bin counts as Poisson processes
with ﬁxed intensities. Let Z,- be the vector containing local genomic
information, such as mappability and GC-content as in Kuan et a].
(2011) and Rashid et a]. (2011) for the ith bin. We consider the follow-
ing bin-speciﬁc prior distributions for local Poisson intensities of the in-
put sample:

M i: i N ,i a
( ’ '2 Z) F<a 11(4)) (2)
“(4) = exPlJ/o +fy(Zi)},

where yo is a normalization constant such that 2;] “(z,) = 1 and fy(.) is
a function of local genomic information. We adopt the ﬂexible smoothing
spline framework as in Kuan et a]. (2011) for capturing the effect of
mappability and GC by fy(.) on the input read counts.

For the ChIP sample, we deﬁne an unobserved variable B,- to indicate
enrichment state of bin 1', e.g. B, = 0, for background bins. For enriched
bins, we allow J different states to reﬂect levels of enrichment strengths
(e.g. J :2 broadly captures low- and high-afﬁnity binding for TFs),
and correspondingly B, = j, j = 1, - - - , J. The prior distributions for
each state are

where 80 e (0, 1) is a normalizing factor reﬂecting the proportion of back-
ground reads in the ChIP sample (Liang and Keles, 2012; Xu et al., 2010).
For brevity, we denote “(2,) by u, by suppressing its dependence on 2,,
which is ﬁxed for a genome at given read and fragment lengths and bin

In contrast to the Kuan et a]. (2011) model, marginal distributions in
our model arise from two levels of hierarchy: a local Poisson distribution
and a prior distribution. The local Poisson structure is critical for model-
ing counts for each bin on a process level as sequencing depths increase.
The prior distribution models the intrinsic read biases, which are sup-
ported by arguments in Rozowsky et a]. (2009) and Xu et a]. (2010). In
the resulting model, although the number of local Poisson parameters ifs
is the same as the number of observations, inference is possible through
Bayesian analysis where the posterior distribution of the ChIP counts for
each bin given the bin count y,- and enrichment state B, = j is given by:

(A; 122' = 21*, Bi =1; Yi = yi) N F<bj +yi, V + NV), (6)
j = 1,2, ---,J. Determining the number of components J is a model

selection problem within the CSSP framework. In practice, we recom-
mend setting J to 2. Kuan et a]. (2011) observed that when modeling
the ChIP signal as a mixture of negative binomial distributions, two
components adequately captured both the low- and high-afﬁnity binding.
Our R package enables using larger values of J and users can apply model
selection criterion, such as Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz,
1978) to control model complexity. We used J :2 for the examples
presented in this article.

2.2 A multiple testing procedure and power evaluation

There is a plethora of algorithms for assessing whether individual bins are
enriched in the ChIP sample compared with input sample (Wilbanks and
Facciotti, 2010). Our CSSP framework naturally lands itself into a mul-
tiple testing framework. For unenriched bin 1', the ChIP count originates
from negative binomial distribution, Y, ~ NB(b,b/(eop,,Ny)), and ChIP
counts for enriched bins have larger values. Therefore, we consider one-
sided testing against the null H0 : Y, ~ NB(b,b/(eou,N,,)). Under the
prior distribution for the local Poisson rate, the decision rule based on
the marginal distribution achieves optimal Bayes risk. The P-value for
Y, = y, is thus Pval(y,) = P{ Y, : y,| Y, ~ NB(b,b/(eOp,,Ny))}. Suppose
we control the overall Type-I error at q and reject the null hypothesis
when Pval(y,)<ozq. The corresponding rejection region for bin R,- is
(Q,(ozq), 00) where Q,(ozq) is the (1 — aq)-th percentile of the null distri-
bution. To control the FDR, we set 01,, using the BenjaminiiHochberg
procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The mean power of the
aforementioned testing procedure across all enriched bins is given by

Z P{Y,> Q,(aq) I Bi 79 0}
i:B,-#0
#{i : B, 7'5 0}

This deﬁnition of power nominally considers all enriched regions
regardless of their actual enrichment levels, i.e. effect sizes. However,
in practice, investigators expect true proteiniDNA interaction regions
to not only exhibit statistically higher read counts in the ChIP sample
compared with the input sample but also achieve a pre-determined
enrichment level. Regions failing to achieve this are usually ﬁltered by
peak callers (i.e. SPP and MACS) through post-processing. The

P0w,’l(Ny) =

statistical implication of such a practice is that in testing the observed
ChIP count Y,- against the background distribution, we should impose
restriction on the effect size in addition to a P-value threshold. As a
result, when evaluating the power across all enriched regions, our atten-
tion should be restricted to only the enriched regions with sufﬁciently
large effect sizes.

We introduce quality thresholds, including a fold change threshold r
and a minimum intensity threshold 1', to accommodate this practical
issue. As a result, the enrichment detection procedure requires that
read counts exceed not only the corresponding percentile Q,(ozq) required
for FDR control but are also r fold of the prior mean mum], and ex-
ceed minimum intensity of rN,,.. Hence, the peak calling threshold for bin
1' is

2(0an ra T) = Qi(aq) V reOl’LiNv V TNya

where X \/ y = max(x, y). As a result, we establish the following condi-
tional power function:

P0wq.r.r(Ny) 2 [EA  a 
where A = {i :  >reou, \/ r, B, 75 0}, and #A denotes the size of set A.
This deﬁnition depends on local Poisson parameters, which are usually
not estimable. We propose the following conditional posterior power
function by plugging in Bayesian estimators of the numerator and de-
nominator of Equation (7), respectively. A numerical algorithm to com-
pute (8) is presented in Supplementary Materials Section A.

2.3 Estimating the model parameters

We present the details of the overall model ﬁtting procedure in
Supplementary Materials Section B and highlight a few key points
here. The parameters in CSSP are estimated based on the marginal dis-
tributions of the ChIP and input read counts in three consecutive steps.
First, we estimate hyper parameters in fy(.) by ﬁtting a negative binomial
regression model to the input sample. This is easily carried out with the
glm.nb() function in R. Second, we estimate the normalization factor 80,
the proportion of background bins 710 and the dispersion parameter b
from the ChIP sample. These parameters normalize the ChIP sample
against the input sample and are critical for the downstream power
evaluation. We observed that the conventional estimating methods, e.g.
maximum likelihood and method of moments, lead to poor estimators
of 710 and b (Supplementary Materials Section D). Therefore, we pro-
pose the following minimum distance estimator, which is motivated
by the minimum distance and robust estimation framework in Parr
and Schucany (1980) as an alternative. Let F,,(.) denote the empirical
distribution of Pval(y,) derived from initial estimators of so and b.
If we plug in the true values and apply continuity adjustment
(Lemma 1, Supplementary Materials Section B), F” should be a mixture
of uniform distribution between 0 and 1 arising from background
bins and a point mass concentrated near 0, representing P-values
from enriched bins. In other words, when X> c for some tuning param-
eter c, F,,(x) % nox + (1 — no), where 710 denotes the proportion of un-
enriched bins. Then minimum distance estimators of 80, b and 710 are
given by

(éo, IS, fro) = arg min sup | F,,(X) — X710 + 1 — 710 |. (9)

The estimated powers were generally >80% indicating that
>80% of true enriched regions that meet our fold change and
minimum intensity thresholds were identiﬁed. We evaluated
robustness of these power calculations with simulations in
Supplementary Materials Section H (Supplementary Table S5).
The estimated power, in general, should increase as sequencing
depth increases. However, when comparing power estimates
across different experiments, quality of the individual datasets
should be considered. We investigated the sequencing quality
metrics of these datasets provided by the ENCODE consortium
(Supplementary Table S6) and corroborated implications of
these metrics with our power results. For cFos and cJun,
SPOT and PBC values are comparable for both cell lines, reﬂect—
ing comparable data quality. As a result, power estimates for the
deeper sequenced Huvec samples are higher. For Pol 11, SPOT
values of Huvec, which are reﬂective of the signal—noise ratio, are
a lot smaller than those of K562. Hence, for Pol 11, although
the sequencing depth of the Huvec dataset is almost twice of the
K562, K562 sample has higher or comparable power.

3.7 Power implications for other peak callers

Although the CSSP framework uses a speciﬁc peak calling pro—
cedure based on testing against background read distribution
and quality thresholding, power estimated by CSSP has implica—
tions for other peak callers. To illustrate this, we considered one
of the commonly used peak callers SPP (Kharchenko et al.,
2008), which is also adopted by the ENCODE project. The
key to adapting CSSP power estimation to SPP is to identify
quality thresholds r and ‘L' that would correspond to the analysis
generated by SPP at the same FDR level. To enable this com—
parison on the ENCODE datasets, we used the enriched regions
identified by SPP and set the r and 1' parameters based on data
from these regions. Speciﬁcally, to set ‘L', we mapped the ﬁltered
reads to 200 bp regions surrounding the binding sites identiﬁed
by SPP, and then set TN‘, as the minimum ChIP count across
these bins. Similarly, we set rNx/Ny to the minimum ChIP to
input count ratio of these bins to estimate r.

We then applied the CSSP model with these r and ‘L' estimates
driven by the SPP analysis. We evaluated how well the set of
enriched regions from CSSP and SPP agreed with the idea that,
for datasets with good agreement, the CSSP power would yield
an upper bound for the SPP power (Table 2). In addition to

imposing the fold change and minimum count thresholds, SPP
further ﬁlters the set of enriched regions based on the symmetry
of the read distributions around each enrichment site; therefore,
it is more conservative than CSSP. For the four datasets where
the overlap percentages between CSSP and SPP exceeded 90%,
CSSP estimated power presents upper bounds for the SPP
power. For the other four experiments, >15% of SPP peaks
are not captured by the CSSP model. We noticed that these
four experiments either have lower data quality or sequencing
depths, and the discrepancy between the two peaks caller might
due to low signal—to—noise ratios or different FDR control pro—
cedures and requires further investigation.

4 DISCUSSION

The sequencing depths of most, if not all, initial published ex—
periments have been limited by practical considerations, such as
cost or instrument availability. With decreasing sequencing costs,
considerations are shifting from how many sequences should be
obtained for a single experiment, to how many experiments one
can perform in a single lane. Therefore, power calculations are ex—
tremely important for ChIP—seq experiments. We have developed
the CSSP framework to enable such power calculations. This
framework can be applied to compute power at a wide range
of sequencing depths with varying fold change and minimum
intensity thresholds. Our extensive computational experiments
demonstrated the consistency in predicting power from pilot
data and its practical implications. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first model that enables power analysis for ChIP—seq
data through an analytical approach.

It is worth noting that although our calculations mostly em—
phasize the sequencing depth N y, other parameters including en
and v], which indicate the signal—to—noise ratio of the data, as well
as the data quality are also important factors of the power ana—
lysis. These parameters are fixed when comparing datasets
obtained under the same experimental conditions. However, for
comparing datasets with different experimental conditions, such
as TF and cell line, effects of data quality and strengths of enrich—
ment signals should bear equal emphasis. Our limited investiga—
tion of the laboratory and batch effects indicated that laboratory
effects are larger than batch effects within a laboratory, and that
pilot data from the same laboratory would yield more unbiased
power prediction than pilot data from another laboratory.

Although the analytical calculations in the CSSP framework
depend on the peak calling procedure implied by our model, the

power estimation has broad applications for other peak callers.
In general, if the peaks identiﬁed by the peak caller can also
be identified by CSSP at the same FDR level and at certain
fold change and minimum enrichment thresholds, then the
power evaluated at these thresholds can serve as the upper
bound for that peak caller. When peaks identiﬁed by a peak
caller are vastly different than that of the CSSP, our power
results can not directly be related to that peak caller.
Analyzing the power for an arbitrary peak caller requires spe—
cialization of our algorithm. Overall, as the CSSP peak calling
procedure is simpler than most existing peak callers, our power
estimation can serve as a benchmark for other peak callers.

The CSSP framework also enables the investigation of the
impact of input sequencing depth on power. Our computational
experiments indicate that increasing the input depth does not
increase the peak calling power or the accuracy of power predic—
tion. The impact of input depth is, to a large extent, determined
by how the ChIP read counts are normalized against input read
counts, a procedure that highly varies among peak callers.
Overall, our results suggest that if the ChIP sample is normalized
efﬁciently against the input data, the dependence of power on
input depths may be reduced.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Although peak finding in next-generation sequencing
(NGS) datasets has been addressed extensively, there is no consen-
sus on how to analyze and process biological replicates. Furthermore,
most peak finders do not focus on accurate determination of enrich-
ment site widths and are not widely applicable to different types of
datasets.

Results: We developed JAMM (goint Analysis of NGS replicates via
Mixture Model clustering): a peak finder that can integrate information
from biological replicates, determine enrichment site widths accurately
and resolve neighboring narrow peaks. JAMM is a universal peak
finder that is applicable to different types of datasets. We show that
JAMM is among the best performing peak finders in terms of site
detection accuracy and in terms of accurate determination of enrich-
ment sites widths. In addition, JAMM’s replicate integration improves
peak spatial resolution, sorting and peak finding accuracy.
Availability and implementation: JAMM is available for free and can
run on Linux machines through the command line: http://code.goog|e.

1 INTRODUCTION

A common task in Genomics research is detecting enriched sites
after alignment of next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads,
which involves separating the genome into regions of high en-
richment (i.e. peaks or clusters or binding sites) and regions of
low enrichment (Pepke et al., 2009). Most peak and cluster ﬁnd-
ing programs are developed with a speciﬁc experimental protocol
or dataset type in mind (Kumar et al., 2013). Therefore, it is
usually difﬁcult to apply the same analysis pipeline uniformly
across all datasets in a given project.

Recently, there were attempts to develop universal peak finders
by deﬁning the problem as that of classical signal detection
(Kumar et al., 2013). The main advantage of this approach is
that it allows for uniform data analysis Via theoretically proven
optimal signal detection. However, it does not take into account
that enrichment sites are often not expected to have the same shape
or signal properties, even if in the same dataset. For example,
DNase-I hypersensitive regions are expected to have different

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

widths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR; Natarajan et al., 2012).
Therefore, there is a need for an approach that would not only
focus on optimal detection of enrichment sites but would also be
able to adapt to enrichment sites with different signal properties
and to deﬁne their boundaries accurately 0(ing et al., 2012).

Furthermore, while others focus on integration of multiple
datasets to deﬁne co-occurrence or differential enrichment [see
Li et a]. (2014); Liu et a]. (2013); Shen et a]. (2013) and Zeng et a].
(2013) for examples], there is no consensus on biological repli-
cates integration to ﬁnd accurate consensus peaks. One common
approach is to determine enriched sites on each replicate separ-
ately, and then combine the results Via union or intersection
(Schweikert et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014). Another common
approach is to pool aligned reads from all replicates available
and then detect enriched sites on the pooled alignments [see
Tuteja et a]. (2009) for an example]. Taking the intersect or
union of separately detected sites mandates rescoring the peaks
and leads to inaccurate enriched sites’ widths. Pooling alignments
before site detection obscures the differential spatial and intensity
information in the replicates. As biological replicate experiments
are not expected to be exactly reproducible, there is a need to
develop a method for replicate integration that takes advantage
of the differential information in the individual replicates to find
accurate consensus peaks.

In this article, we introduce JAMM (._loint Analysis of NGS
replicates Via Mixture Model clustering): a universal peak finder
that can integrate information from multiple replicates to find
consensus peaks, determine accurate peak widths and resolve
neighboring narrow peaks. We demonstrate JAMM using
ChIP—Seq (Johnson et al., 2007), including transcription factor
ChIP—Seq, punctate histone modification ChIP—Seq and broad
histone modification ChIP—Seq as well as DNase—Seq
(Crawford et al., 2006). We compare several programs that
focus on different aspects of the peak ﬁnding problem
(Table 1). MACS (Zhang et al., 2008) models read counts
using a local Poisson distribution, PeakRanger (Feng et al.,
2011) focuses on detecting neighboring narrow peaks at high
resolution, PeakZilla (Bardet et al., 2013) is designed for uniform
punctate transcription factor binding sites, BCP 0(ing et al.,
2012) develops explicit formulas to model read counts, CCAT
0(u et al., 2010) detects broad enrichment patterns with low
SNR and DFilter (Kumar et al., 2013) is a universal peak
finder based on optimal signal detection. We demonstrate that
JAMM is widely applicable to different types of datasets, can
deﬁne accurate peak boundaries and that JAMM’s replicate in-
tegration improves peak ﬁnding resolution and accuracy.

2 JAMM PEAK FINDING METHODS

2.1 Overview

Figure 1 provides an overview of JAMM’s analysis steps. Core
peak ﬁnding steps involve selecting local windows that are en-
riched over background, followed by clustering the normalized
extended-read counts in those windows into a peak cluster and
noise cluster(s). Local clustering allows J AMM to adapt to peaks
with different widths and signal properties and to accurately de-
termine their boundaries. Furthermore, using clustering as an
approach for peak ﬁnding extends naturally to multivariate clus-
tering, which is useful for integrating datasets that are correlated
but not expected to be exactly the same, such as biological rep-
licates. We chose clustering Via multivariate Gaussian mixture
models (Banﬁeld and Raftery, 1993), which allows for including
information about the covariance of the replicates. Finally,
JAMM scores peaks Via the peak signal, represented by the geo-
metric mean of the replicates peak signals, and how it compares
to background.

2.2 Extended read counts

For ChIP-Seq datasets, JAMM uses cross-correlation analysis to
estimate the average fragment length (Ramachandran et al.,
2013, see Supplementary Text). (Step 1, Fig. 1) Fragment
length is calculated for each replicate, including biological con-
trol, separately.

Reads are extended/truncated to the average fragment length
in the 5/-to-3/ direction. Extended-read counts at each base pair
are divided by the mean extended-read count to produce normal-
ized extended-read counts.

2.3 Enriched windows

JAMM selects enriched windows and then assigns peaks locally
in those windows (Steps 2, 3 and 4, Fig. 1). To find enriched
windows, JAMM divides the genome into small non-overlapping
bins and makes a decision whether each bin is enriched over
background. All book-ended enriched bins are merged into

larger, non-overlapping, variable-width enriched windows. This
approach ensures that enriched windows include entire binding
sites and that JAMM can seamlessly adapt to broader enrich-
ment domains. In addition, determining enrichment on the bin-
level ensures maximized sensitivity, so that JAMM can easily
adapt to reporting a large number of peaks.

Similar to Song and Smith (2011), JAMM selects the bin size A
that minimizes the cost function Cn(A) (Shimazaki and
Shinomoto, 2007):

= 2k — v
CM) (nA)2 ’

 

where n is the total number of reads, k is the average number of
reads per bin for bins with width A and v is the variance
(Shimazaki and Shinomoto, 2007). The user can also specify
an arbitrary bin size. For multiple replicates, the optimum bin
size is calculated separately for each replicate and the smallest bin
size is selected.

where as and a), are the average normalized extended-read

bin and the corresponding chromosome, respectively. Any
SNR=g—;, where as is the average sample normalized ex-
tended-read count and a), is the standard deviation of the control
normalized extended-read count. For multiple replicates, all rep-
licates have to pass this enrichment test for a bin to be considered
enriched.

2.4 Peak ﬁnding

JAMM assumes that the signal (smoothed extended-read counts,
see Supplementary Text) in enriched windows originated from a
univariate Gaussian mixture model for single sample analysis or
a multivariate Gaussian mixture model when integrating multiple
replicates (Step 5, Fig. 1; Banﬁeld and Raftery, 1993; Celeux and
Govaert, 1995; Fraley et al., 2012):

T K

n 2 Wk >< Nk(bpt|/‘Lkv 3k)

t=lk=l

where T is the window size, K is the number of components
(clusters), bp, is the read signal value for base pair I, wk is the
weight of component k in the mixture and uk and 2k are the
vector of means and the covariance matrix for component k,
respectively (Fraley et al., 2012). The Gaussian mixture model
is deﬁned by the set of parameters O=w1...wk. Ml.../tk.21...2k.

To find accurate peak boundaries in enriched windows, JAMM
ﬁts a Gaussian mixture model to cluster the smoothed extended-
read count in each enriched window separately, assuming either
two mixture components (corresponding to peaks and noise, par-
ameters: -m normal) or three mixture components (corresponding
to peaks, peak tails and noise, parameters: -m narrow). In the
univariate case, variance is assumed to be different between dif-
ferent components. In the mutivariate case, the covariance matrix
is assumed to be different among different components and is
parameterized according to its eigenvalue decomposition
(Banﬁeld and Raftery, 1993):

7l
2k=Tk X Ak X Tk
and
Ak=lk XAk,

where Tk is the orthogonal matrix of the eigenvectors and Ak is a
diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues at the diagonals, with Ak
being the first eigenvalue in Ak and Ak being a diagonal matrix
with a vector at the diagonal that is proportional to the vector of
eigenvalues. Therefore, Tk determines the orientation of the eigen-
vectors of k, while Ak deﬁnes the volume k occupies in the
n-dimensional space and Ak deﬁnes the shape of the contour
lines (Banﬁeld and Raftery, 1993).

Gaussian mixture clustering starts with chromosome-wide par-
ameter initialization based on an imaginary large window W,
formed by concatenating the top-scoring windows in the
chromosome. First, data points are assigned to clusters Via
k-means. Cluster assignments are then used to initialize an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to ﬁt a Gaussian
mixture model (Celeux and Govaert, 1995) starting with the
maximization step. The Expectation step calculates the condi-
tional probability that the read count signal at a given base
pair bp, originated from component k given O: pk(bp,)|O. The
Maximization step calculates the maximum likelihood estimates
of the model parameters O given all p1...pk for all bpl...bp,.

Assigning bp, to a cluster k is derived directly from p1mk(bp,)
where bp, is assigned to the mixture component k that maximizes
pk(bp,). Different structures of the covariance matrix (namely Tk
AkAkTgl and TkAkATgl) are tested and the one maximizing the
Bayesian Information Criteria is chosen (Fraley et al., 2012, see
Supplementary Text). Formulas to update O (Maximization
Step) and pk(bp,) (Expectation Step) for both models are
described by Celeux and Govaert (1995).

The model learned for W, is used to initialize the EM Gaussian
mixture clustering algorithm for every enriched window separ-
ately starting with the Expectation step. The mixture component
with the highest mean is taken to be the enriched cluster and
contiguous base pairs assigned to this cluster are taken to be the
peaks. In the multivariate case, all replicates are required to agree
on the mixture component mean ordering, otherwise the window
is rejected (see Supplementary Text).

2.5 Peak scoring

The background signal in every peak is subtracted from the cor-
responding sample signal (Step 6, Fig. 1). When analyzing repli-
cates, sample signal is taken to be the per-position geometric
mean of the replicates signals. The resulting background-normal-
ized signal values are averaged to produce the mean peak back-
ground-normalized signal (am). In addition, JAMM executes the
Mann7Whitney U non-parametric test to compare the sample
signal (not background normalized) with the corresponding
background signal. A Benjamini7Hochberg correction
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) is applied to the full list of
P—Values after peak ﬁnding is complete. JAMM deﬁnes the
peak score to be

Sp = Mm X —[0g10(pcorrected)-

By default, each peak is scored and reported as a separate peak
(parameters: -r peak). All peaks detected in one window can
be merged to be scored and reported as one peak (parameters:
-r region).

2.6 Implementation and output

JAMM is implemented as a bash script with peak ﬁnding and
scoring implemented by R and Perl scripts. Other post— or
preprocessing steps can be added to the pipeline easily if
needed. JAMM outputs a sorted peak list in standard
narrowPeak format with peak scores, P—Values, corrected
P—Values and peak summits.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Accuracy and spatial resolution

First, we sought to establish that JAMM achieves a similar or better
site detection accuracy compared with other peak ﬁnders. Accuracy
refers to the extent to which peak ﬁnders can determine the correct
locations of enriched sites. Because there is no gold standard for
benchmarking peak ﬁnders (Szalkowski and Schmid, 2011), we
analyzed ﬁve different ENCODE transcription factor ChIP-Seq
datasets, including CTCF-HeLa, CTCF-K562, NRSF—K562,
MAX-K562 and SRF-GM12878 (see Supplementary Tables S1
and Skwe refer to those datasets as ‘accuracy—benchmark’ data-
sets) using three different benchmarking methods: (i) motif ﬁnding
precision (fraction of called peaks with motif matches) using FIMO
(Grant et al., 2011), which uses a uniform zero-order background
model, (ii) maximum cumulative motif likelihood using
SpeakerScan (Megraw et al., 2009), which uses a ﬁrst-order local
background model and (iii) accuracy of recovery of manually
curated positive peaks as reported by Rye et al. (2011) (see
Section 5 and Supplementary Text). Regarding motif precision,
we found that all peak ﬁnders perform comparably although
DFilter and JAMM rank better when results are averaged across
multiple datasets (Supplementary Table S1). Regarding motif like-
lihood, we also found that all peak ﬁnders, except BCP, perform
rather comparably. However, JAMM ranks better than other peak
ﬁnders when results are averaged across multiple datasets
(Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Figs S173). Finally, we
found that PeakZilla is the best performing peak ﬁnder, followed by
JAMM and PeakRanger, in terms of recovering manually curated
positive peaks (Supplementary Table S1). When we average the
results over all datasets and all benchmarks (a total of nine com-
parisons, Supplementary Methods), we found that JAMM and
PeakRanger are the top ranking programs (Fig. 2a). JAMM
ranked ﬁrst for two benchmarks and third for one benchmark.
PeakRanger ranked second for all benchmarks (Supplementary
Table 1).

When comparing JAMM-I (JAMM with replicate integration)
with JAMM running on pooled replicates (JAMM-P), we found
that JAMM-I consistently outperforms JAMM-P (JAMM-P
ranked better than JAMM-I in only one out of ﬁve datasets
where there was a difference), indicating that JAMM’s replicate
integration improves peak ﬁnding accuracy over replicate read
pooling. A main contributing factor is JAMM-I’s better spatial
resolution owing to replicate integration Via multivariate mixture
model clustering. Figure 2b provides a demonstration of JAMM-
I’s improvement over replicate pooling. Only JAMM-I can re-
solve two neighboring CTCF binding sites: the pooled replicate
profile obscures the better spatial resolution of Replicate 1 owing
to the poorer resolution of Replicate 2.

To further conﬁrm peak finding accuracy, we analyzed data-
sets used by Bardet et al. (2013) Via the peak ﬁnding precision
benchmark (FIMO-based), including Twist, PHA-4, NFKB,
CEBPA and Ste12 (we refer to those datasets as ‘bardet-bench—
mark’ datasets, see Supplementary Table S6). We found
PeakZilla, PeakRanger and JAMM-I to be, on average, the
top performing programs (see Supplementary Table S2).

Next, we asked whether peak finders can deﬁne accurate en-
richment site widths. We found that BCP underestimates peak
widths, while DFilter and MACS overestimate peak widths
(Fig 2c and d). JAMM, PeakZilla and PeakRanger have accurate
peak width determination to a large extent. PeakRanger slightly
underestimated the peak widths of some sites with both CTCF
and NRSF, while PeakZilla ﬁxes peak widths at twice the esti-
mated fragment length (Bardet et al., 2013) (Supplementary Figs
S4 and S5). Additionally, we observed a similar result with
DNase-Seq: while JAMM can assign peak boundaries corres-
ponding accurately to variable-width DNase-I-hypersensitive re-
gions, DFilter can not (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Spatial resolution is especially relevant for histone modifica-
tions with punctate enrichment patterns. We analyzed peak
coverage (see Section 5) of ENCODE HeLa-S3 H3K4me3.
H3K4me3 is expected to be maximally enriched immediately

upstream and downstream of active transcription start sites
(TSSs) (Guenther et al., 2007). Although ChIP-Seq datasets typ-
ically have enough resolution to separate the signal upstream of
TSSs from the signal downstream (Fig. 3a), many peak ﬁnders
can not recover this resolution. Out of the peak ﬁnders we tested,
only JAMM and PeakRanger can, on average, resolve neighbor-
ing H3K4me3 peaks, while other peak ﬁnders detect, on average,
one large peak encompassing multiple enriched sites (Fig. 3b and
c, see also Fig. 5b).

3.2 Broad enrichment patterns

Peak ﬁnders designed to process punctate enrichment sites are
typically not able to capture broad enrichment domains, often

because those domains feature relatively low SNR and stretch
over thousands of base pairs. H3K27me3 and other histone
modiﬁcations display broad enrichment patterns when assayed
with ChIP-Seq. We tested CCAT 0(u et al., 2010) (Via
PeakRanger’s implementation of the CCAT algorithm) and
BCP 0(ing et al., 2012) (both designed for broad enrichment
domains) as well as DFilter and JAMM (both universal peak
finders) in terms of their ability to capture broad enrichment
patterns. We found that BCP assigns the most broad peaks.
JAMM also assigns broad peaks but generally smaller than
those called by BCP. DFilter and PeakRanger’s CCAT are less
suited for defining broader enrichment domains (Fig. 4).

3.3 Peak scoring and sorting

JAMM can typically report a large number of peaks and relies
on its peak scoring to robustly rank the reported peaks (see
Section 5). This facilitates downstream analysis and gives users
more ﬂexibility in choosing a method to ﬁlter the peaks.
Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) (Li et al., 2011) is an
ENCODE-recommended method for filtering peak calls based
on replicate reproducibility (Landt et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, the IDR
pipeline involves calling peaks on the replicates separately, fol-
lowed by applying the IDR statistical model to determine the
number of reproducible peaks n given a certain IDR threshold.
Peak reproducibility involves whether the peaks overlap and how
their ranks compare in the replicates peak lists. Finally, peaks are
called on the combined replicates and the top n peaks are taken
to be the high-conﬁdence reproducible peaks (see ChIP-Seq IDR
Web page for more information: https://sites.google.com/site/
anshulkundaje/projects/idr).

We applied the IDR analysis pipeline to HeLa-S3 CTCF
ChIP-Seq ENCODE dataset. We found that sorting the peaks
using JAMM’s peak scores produces a clear phase shift between
reproducible peaks and irreproducible peaks (Fig. 5a). To call
peaks jointly on biological replicates (the ﬁnal step in the IDR
pipeline), aligned reads are usually pooled before peak finding,
but pooling alignments obscures the differential signal intensities
of the replicates, and, therefore, may lead to invalid peak sorting.
Figure 5b shows an example of cases where JAMM-I’s integrated
sorting of peaks provides a more valid peak sort than sorting
peaks called on pooled alignments. Pooling the replicates
obscured the spatial information regarding peak ‘b’ (JAMM)
as the two replicates do not agree on a specific peak location.
JAMM relies on geometric averaging of replicates peak signal to
score the peaks, which leads to more valid peak scores than those
based on read pooling.

Taken together, JAMM provides a plausible approach to rep-
licate integration that is widely applicable to different types of
datasets and protocols. The analysis pipeline would start with
peak calling on the replicates separately, followed by IDR ana-
lysis to select n (the number of reproducible peaks). Finally,
peaks are called on the replicates jointly Via JAMM’s replicate
integration and the top-scoring n peaks are taken as a highly
conﬁdent set.

4 DISCUSSION

A desirable property in universal peak ﬁnders is detecting, and
correctly determining the widths of, enrichment sites with differ-
ent signal properties. JAMM ﬁts a Gaussian mixture model for
every local enriched window separately and only ﬁxes the struc-
ture of the covariance matrix (see Section 2 and Supplementary
Text). Therefore, JAMM can accurately determine widths of en-
richment sites that have different signal properties, even if in the
same dataset. Some peak ﬁnders start with learning an expected
peak shape (Bardet et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2013), making it
more difﬁcult to detect enrichment sites with varying widths or to
assign their boundaries accurately. Other peak ﬁnders adapt spe-
cialized subroutines for reﬁning peak widths after peak ﬁnding is
complete (Rashid et al., 2011). In some cases, this approach may
be able to assign accurate peak boundaries. But when the ori-
ginal peak represents several closely spaced sites, this approach
may result in choosing one site and missing the others (see
Supplementary Fig. S5 in Rashid et al. (2011) for an example).
We showed that JAMM’s local clustering also avoids this caveat
and can correctly resolve neighboring punctate sites, similar to
programs specifically designed with this task in mind like
PeakRanger (Feng et al., 2011).

JAMM is a universal peak finder that can analyze different
types of datasets with little change, if any, to the underlying
method. This demonstrates that ﬁnding enriched sites in read-
density7based NGS datasets is essentially the same task regard-
less of the sites’ signal properties. Therefore, we propose that

more attention could be directed toward developing universal
peak ﬁnding solutions, refining preprocessing of read counts to
correct for different biases (Hashimoto et al., 2014) and toward
developing solutions for biological replicates integration Wang
et al., 2014).

Pooling reads from biological replicates before peak finding is
part of the ENCODE consortium recommended guidelines
(Landt et al., 2012). However, when peaks are called on
pooled replicates, the differential intensities and differential spa-
tial coverage of the replicates are obscured. JAMM addresses
replicate integration by looking at biological replicates as not
being exactly reproducible and attempts to model their variabil-
ity using information about their covariance in local enriched
windows. Using various accuracy benchmarks, we demonstrated
that this approach results in better peak ﬁnding accuracy over
read pooling.

For peak scoring on replicates, JAMM uses the geometric
average of the replicates peak signal. We demonstrated that
this approach improves peak sorting. Additionally, we also
show that peak finding on the geometric mean of separately
normalized replicate signal proﬁles can improve peak ﬁnding
accuracy over read pooling similarly to JAMM-I (see JAMM-
G in Supplementary Text Section 1.2 and Supplementary Table
S3). Geometric averaging of normalized signal proﬁles can po-
tentially be implemented as a preprocessing step irrespective of
the speciﬁc peak finding method. Therefore, although it may not
be an optimal solution with increasing replicates variability, it is
a plausible approach that other peak ﬁnders could easily imple-
ment for biological replicates analysis, without requiring a multi-
variate clustering framework.

Accuracy benchmarks are independent of read count densities,
as opposed to peaks per cluster (Fig. 3) and peak width accuracy
(Fig. 2c and d). However, motif content benchmarks do not
represent a deﬁnite gold standard because of our incomplete
understanding of protein7DNA interactions and potential
biases in the benchmarking methods (Szalkowski and Schmid,
2011). We attempted to remedy this by using two different motif

scanning algorithms and by including a manually curated set of
peak calls as an additional benchmark (Rye et al., 2011). But
manual curation may also be biased because the manually
curated set represents only a small fraction of the peaks present
in a dataset (345 peaks for MAX, 235 for NRSF and 198 for
SRF), and because some peak ﬁnders (like PeakZilla) use peak
detection methods similar to curation criteria (Bardet et al., 2013;
Rye et al., 2011).

Many peak finders ignore being able to report a larger number
of peaks and/or ignore providing appropriate peak scores
(Table 1), both required criteria for assessing replicate reprodu-
cibility Via IDR analysis (Li et al., 2011). Appropriate peak
scores would have few or no ties and represent the conﬁdence
in the peak accurately based on its read density and how it com-
pares with background or biological control. JAMM can typic-
ally determine a large number of peaks, and it also provides
robust peak scores with few score ties if any. This, in addition
to its accurate peak width determination, makes JAMM poten-
tially more applicable for different types of downstream analyses
that rely on ranked peak lists.

Although a multivariate clustering framework can potentially
be used for differential peak finding, JAMM can not ﬁnd differ-
ential peaks across multiple conditions in its current implemen-
tation. Also, J AMM does not take into account mappability, GC
content and Copy Number Variations (CNVs). CNVs are espe-
cially relevant for cancer cell lines (Pickrell et al., 2011), while GC
content bias is a known problem in high-throughput sequencing
libraries, probably due to PCR ampliﬁcation (Benjamini and
Speed, 2012). We could not detect CNV bias in JAMM’s peak
calls in regions of loss when compared with a peak finder that
corrects for CNVs (Ashoor et al., 2013), but we noticed a pos-
sible increase in the proportion of peaks called by JAMM in
regions of gain (see Supplementary Table S4). Explicit implemen-
tation of GC content bias and CNV correction could improve
peak finding accuracy (Ashoor et al., 2013; Rashid et al., 2011),
and we plan to incorporate appropriate correction subroutines in
the near future. Finally, JAMM is typically slower than other
peak ﬁnders with less complicated models, taking ~&7h on
average to analyze a typical human ENCODE ChIP-Seq dataset
when run using a single processor.

5 METHODS

5.1 Datasets, preprocessing and accuracy analysis

All “accuracy-benchmark” datasets are ENCODE datasets. (Bernstein
et al., 2012). ‘bardet-benchmark’ datasets were produced by Bardet
et al. (2013) and He et al. (2011) for Twist, Schmidt et al. (2010) for
CEBPA, Zhong et al. (2010) for PHA-4 and Kasowski et al. (2010) for
NFKB and Zheng et al. (2010) for Ste12. CTCF-NHEK (used in JAMM-
G analysis), H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and DNase-Seq are
ENCODE datasets (Bernstein et al., 2012). Fastq ﬁles were aligned to
the respective genomes using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012)
(hg19: CTCF-HeLa, CTCF-K562, CTCF-NHEK, NFKB, H3K4me3,
H3K27ac, H3K27me3 - mm9: CEBPA - dm3: Twist - ce6: PHA-4).
Alternatively, we started with the alignments provided by Rye et al.
(2011) (MAX, NRSF, SRF), Zheng et al. (2010) (Ste12) and ENCODE
(DNase-Seq). PCR duplicates were removed using SAMTools (Li et al.,
2009). See Supplementary Text, section 1.1.

Transcription factor motifs were obtained from JASPAR (Mathelier
et al., 2014) (NRSF: MA0138.2, NFKB: MA0105.1, CEBPA: MA0102.2,

PHA-4: MA0047.1, Ste12: MA0393.1), FlyReg (Bergman et al., 2005)
(Twist) and Schmidt et al. (2012) (CTCF). Motif precision analysis was
done using FIMO (P-value, ‘accuracy-benchmark’: 0.0001/
P-value,’bardet-benchmark’: 0.001) (Grant et al., 2011), cumulative log
likelihood analysis was done using SpeakerScan (background window:
150 bp) (Megraw et al., 2009) and the curated peak set provided by Rye
et al. (2011) was used for manual curation analysis. Manual curation
results were deﬁned as the number of peaks that intersect at least one
manually curated positive peak after subtracting the number of peaks
that intersect manually curated negative peaks exclusively. Results for
‘accuracy-benchmark’ transcription factor datasets were (F1 scaled and
averaged over all three benchmarks to produce Fig. 2a. See
Supplementary Text, section 1.3.

5.2 Visualization

Extended Reads per Kilobase per Million reads mapped (RPKM)-
normalized read counts were produced using deepTools (Ramirez et al.,
2014) at 10 bp resolution and visualized in IGV browser (Thorvaldsdéttir
et al., 2013).

Read coverage heatmaps were produced for peak regions (1000 bp in
each direction centered at the peak center) using smoothed extended-read
counts at 10 bp resolution.

For peak coverage plots of histone modiﬁcation peak calls, we inter-
sected each set of peak calls with annotated promoter regions from
UCSC hg19 known genes (4000 bp in each direction centered at the
annotated TSS), using BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Each base
pair was assigned a score of 1 for each intersecting peak. Per-base pair
scores were summed then divided by the mean per-base pair score to
produce normalized peak coverage scores. Raw extended-read coverage
was produced using ngs.plot (Shen et al., 2014) on the same TSS regions.

See Supplementary Text, section 1.3 for more details.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The function of a protein depends not only on its structure
but also on its dynamics. This is at the basis of a large body of ex-
perimental and theoretical work on protein dynamics. Further insight
into the dynamics—function relationship can be gained by studying the
evolutionary divergence of protein motions. To investigate this, we
need appropriate comparative dynamics methods. The most used
dynamical similarity score is the correlation between the root mean
square fluctuations (RMSF) of aligned residues. Despite its usefulness,
RMSF is in general less evolutionarily conserved than the native struc-
ture. A fundamental issue is whether RMSF is not as conserved as
structure because dynamics is less conserved or because RMSF is
not the best property to use to study its conservation.

Results: We performed a systematic assessment of several scores
that quantify the (dis)similarity between protein fluctuation patterns.
We show that the best scores perform as well as or better than struc-
tural dissimilarity, as assessed by their consistency with the SCOP
classiﬁcation. We conclude that to uncover the full extent of the evo-
lutionary conservation of protein fluctuation patterns, it is important to
measure the directions of fluctuations and their correlations between
sites.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteins like all molecules undergo structural ﬂuctuations in
physiological conditions. Small and large structural changes dir-
ectly related to protein functions occur at a wide range of time
scales. Relatively fast local ﬂuctuations are for example involved
in induced-ﬁt ligand binding. Slower and more global ﬂuctu-
ations are important in complex coherent transitions of allosteric
proteins and molecular machines. Such dynamicsifunction rela-
tionships are at the basis of a large body of theoretical and ex-
perimental work on protein dynamics (Henzler-Wildman and
Kern, 2007).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Concerted motions in protein structures are conditioned
by the lowest energy modes of ﬂuctuations around their
equilibrium conformation. These modes can be obtained from
simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simu-
lations, where the modes are extracted by principal component
analysis of the covariance matrix. Alternatively, and to avoid
high computational costs, the normal modes can be calculated
from an equilibrium structure (typically an experimental struc-
ture determined by X-ray scattering or nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR)) using coarse-grained represen-
tations and elastic network models (ENMs), implying a har-
monic approximation of the potential around the equilibrium
structure. Several independent studies have shown that ENM
modes and principal components obtained from MD simulations
are in very good agreement, see e.g. Rueda et a]. (2007),
Skjaerven et a]. (2011), and Yang et a]. (2008). For these reasons,
ENM normal modes are commonly used to characterize protein
dynamics and are convenient for studying large protein datasets.
In addition, allosterism has been successfully studied using
ENMs and it has been shown that functional conformational
changes in general usually involve only a few normal modes,
see for instance Bahar et a]. (2010). This has for example been
exploited to investigate allosteric mechanisms and predict ef-
fector binding sites (Mitternacht and Berezovsky, 2011a,b; Zen
et al., 2009)

In contrast with sequence or structure, using dynamics in com-
parative computational studies has only recently started to
emerge. Yet this is a field that has already contributed signiﬁ-
cantly to increasing our understanding of protein dynamics, and
in particular its conservation through evolution and relation to
function. In general, it has been shown that backbone ﬂuctu-
ations are evolutionarily conserved (Maguid et al., 2006, 2008).
More detailed studies of particular folds or protein families have
found that the lowest energy normal modes, or equivalently, the
highest principal components of the ﬂuctuation covariance
matrix, are conserved for homologous proteins or even for
non-homologous proteins with similar folds (Carnevale et al.,
2006; Hollup et al., 2011; Keskin et al., 2000; Maguid et al.,
2005, 2008; Pang et al., 2005). One obvious field of application
is the adaptation of proteins to extreme temperatures and the
associated changes in ﬂexibilityisee Papaleo et a]. (2006) and
references therein. Among other applications reported are
dynamics-based alignments and detection of distant homologs

(Keskin et al., 2000; Miinz et al., 2010; Potestio et al., 2010; Zen
et al., 2008) and analysis of evolutionary dynamics (Echave and
Fernandez, 2010; Leo-Macias et al., 2005; Raimondi et al., 2010).

Comparing protein dynamics implies the choice of one or
more properties that characterize the dynamics of the proteins
and measures of the (dis)similarity of such properties. A number
of properties and (dis)similarity measures have so far been
reported to capture the conservation of protein dynamics. The
simplest and most used property is the atomic root mean square
ﬂuctuations (RMSF) (Keskin et al., 2000; Maguid et al., 2006;
Papaleo et al., 2006), which is comparable to X-ray B-factors.
Commonly, interpretations are restricted to only the ﬂuctuations
of the proteins a-carbons (Ca). RMSFs can be readily calculated
from any ensemble of protein conformations, such as those ob-
tained from MD simulations or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
MD and MC simulations are computationally expensive and
hard to parameterize. It is therefore convenient that multiple
studies have shown that protein ﬂexibility is well captured by
the lowest energy normal modes, even when coarse-grained
approaches are used (Rueda et al., 2007; Skjaerven et al., 2011;
Yang et al., 2008).

Several studies on comparative protein dynamics have taken
advantage of this and are based on comparing protein ﬂexibility
as it is described by the proteins’ normal modes (Keskin et al.,
2000; Maguid et al., 2005, 2008). Subspaces spanned by a few
important normal modes or, equivalently, principal components
of the ﬂuctuation covariance matrix, have been compared using
the root mean square inner product [RMSIP see for instance
Carnevale et a]. (2006)] or the related RWSIP (Carnevale et al.,
2007). A dynamic fingerprint matrix has been used to compare
the backbone dynamics between PDZ domains (Miinz et al.,
2010). A dynamic fingerprint matrix is analogous to a distance
matrix for a single protein conformation, measuring variability
of inter-residue distances in an ensemble of conformations.

Actually all the methods described for comparing protein dy-
namics can be seen as ways of comparing the conformational
ensembles that characterise protein ﬂuctuations. Each method
focuses on some property, such as the RMSF profile or the co-
variance matrix, and uses some measure of similarity or dissimi-
larity, such as the Spearman correlation or the RMSIP, for
comparing this property between different proteins.

Because of the variation in the properties and (dis)similarity
measures that have been used on different sets of proteins, it is
difﬁcult to compare the results of these studies. Yet there are
fundamental differences in the dynamical properties and
(dis)similarity measures reported, and there is a need for knowing
which one(s) should be used. For example, systematic studies of
the evolutionary conservation of the ﬂuctuation patterns are
based largely on the similarity between RMSF proﬁles (Maguid
et al., 2006, 2008). These studies have demonstrated the evolu-
tionary conservation of backbone ﬂuctuations. However, RMSF
proﬁles do not utilize the full extent of information available from
computational analysis of protein ﬂexibility, either obtained by
simulations or normal mode analysis. In addition, RMSF proﬁles
have not been shown to be more conserved than protein structure.
Rather, previous studies thoroughly discuss the possibility that
they are less conserved (Maguid et al., 2006, 2008), which we
indeed ﬁnd to be the case. This may be a practical issue of
RMSF not being the property that most adequately describes

the ﬂuctuation patterns or a fundamental one of protein dy-
namics being less evolutionarily conserved than protein structure.
The purpose of this work is also to address this issue.

To tackle the question of whether the rather low conservation
of RMSF proﬁles is a sign of low conservation of protein dy-
namics, we performed an assessment of different ways of com-
paring protein ﬂuctuations. We consider protein domains with
well-defined native structures, for which the conformational en-
sembles that result from ﬂuctuations are adequately described by
multidimensional Gaussian distributions (Hinsen et al., 2000).
Such distributions around an equilibrium are completely char-
acterized by the covariance matrices. The two most frequently
used measures of dynamical similarity are the correlation be-
tween RMSF profiles and the RMSIP between the 10 principal
components of the full covariance matrix. These can be thought
of as two limiting cases: RMSF considers only the overall mag-
nitude of the ﬂuctuation of each Ca-atom, whereas the full co-
variance matrix includes information on the anisotropy (the
directionality) of such ﬂuctuations and their correlations between
sites. To disentangle the different contributions to dynamical
similarity, we also study the correlation matrix, the isotropic
covariance matrix and the isotropic correlation matrix. These
matrices are compared using different measures of (dis)similarity.
RMSIP and RWSIP have previously been used in the literature,
and although they are well motivated by physical arguments they
are not rigorously derived for the comparison of multidimen-
sional Gaussian distributions. Therefore, we also introduce a
new measure, NDB, based on the Bhattacharyya distance be-
tween probability density functions (Bhattacharyya, 1943). The
performances of the properties and the (dis)similarity measures
are evaluated by investigating their consistency with the SCOP
classiﬁcation at the superfamily level.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets

We choose four datasets from the ASTRAL compendium (Chandonia
et al., 2004) (version 1.75), one for each of the four main SCOP classes
(Murzin et al., 1995). All domains were chosen from the subset of the
ASTRAL compendium that has at most 95% sequence identity between
domains. Each dataset is composed of protein domains that belong to
two different superfamilies of the same fold. In addition, for each super-
family we included domains from two different families. We made sure to
make the selection so that all families are represented by at least 6
domains, for a total set of 189 domains. The selection of protein domains
was also partly guided by the need for a structural alignment procedure to
terminate with a successful alignment. The selection contains structures
determined by either X-ray crystallography or NMR spectrometry. For
the 40 protein domains determined by NMR spectroscopy, we veriﬁed
that all structures were representative of a well-deﬁned equilibrium in the
core positions. Throughout, we will refer to speciﬁc folds and superfami-
lies by the relevant part of the SCOP concise classiﬁcation strings, intro-
duced in L0 Conte et a]. (2002). Full listings of the datasets are available
as Supplementary Tables S17S4.

2.2 Deﬁnition of the structural core

We generated multiple structural alignments of all the domains of each
dataset using STAMP (Russell and Barton, 1992). We deﬁne the struc-
tural core as the aligned sites for which there are no gaps and perform all
comparisons on this structural oore.

Comparing and measuring structural fluctuation patterns

 

Comparing only the sites conserved over a whole dataset, we make
sure that the (dis)similarity scores are directly compared only when they
are obtained for corresponding sites. This more conservative way of
aligning the protein domains allows us to properly remove information
about evolutionary relations that are not common to all the compared
domains in a dataset, avoiding the problem of normalizing scores to
alignment length, which is necessary when pairwise alignments are
used. Excluding loops and loosely associated secondary structure elem-
ents also ensures that we are considering the part of the proteins for
which the ENM approach is best motivated.

2.3 Properties compared

All (dis)similarity scores between two proteins involve some property
compared and a measure of (dis)similarity of such a property. To com-
pare structures, we used the equilibrium coordinates of the Cut-atoms in
the structural core. To compare the structural ﬂuctuations, we used dif-
ferent statistics that characterize the multidimensional distribution of
conformations that the proteins may adapt through ﬂuctuations
around the native structure.

We will characterize a protein conformation using the column vector:

r
1'=(l'1,l'2---),

where Tdenotes the transpose and r,- 2 (x,, y,, 2,)Tis the position vector of
the Cut-atom of site i. Let u = < r > be the mean conformation, which we
shall refer to interchangeably as the ‘native structure’ or ‘equilibrium
conformation’. Then a ‘ﬂuctuation’ is characterized by 8r 2 rep and is
composed of CD, ﬂuctuations 8r,- 2 rpm.

A full characterization of ﬂuctuations is given by a probability density
function p(8r). Given this, different statistics can be calculated to describe
the ﬂuctuation patterns. The ones used here are

(L'qu =< (stintsij >, 

where C is the covariance matrix, 1' and j are two Cut-atoms and u and 1)
identify the cartesian components.

it!) it!) is!) it!) 1/2

Pi,- 2 Ci,- / Cii ij , (4)

where P” is the isotropic correlation matrix.
RMSF,- =< Han-H2 >=  (5)

where RMSF is the root mean square ﬂuctuation proﬁle.

Note that C”, P’s" and RMSF are invariant with respect to rotations
of the whole protein: they are isotropic. RMSF contains information on
the amplitudes of ﬂuctuation of each Cut-atom, but not on the correlation
of ﬂuctuations between sites. PM and P quantify such correlations, the
latter taking into account their anisotropic nature. CM and C combine
amplitudes and correlations. Comparison of these different properties
allows the disentangling of different aspects of the ﬂuctuation patterns.

2.3.1 Calculation of the covariance matrix From the previous
deﬁnitions it follows that all properties that will be used here to charac-
terize the ﬂuctuation pattern can be obtained from the covariance matrix.
To calculate the covariance matrix we used the coarse-grained ENM
developed by Hinsen (1998). Thorough assessments show that for calcu-
lation of covariance matrices ENMs are as good as or better than MD
simulations (Ahmed et al., 2010). Each residue is represented as a node
located at the equilibrium position of its Cut-atom and each pair of nodes

are connected by a Hookean spring. In this work we set the equilibrium
positions to the experimental atomic coordinates deposited in the Protein
Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000). The potential energy of the spring
connecting nodes i and j due to departures from the equilibrium conform-

ation is giVen by
Ui-(r) = klll‘lllXilra-ii - ll‘illlz’

where r is a protein conformation, r0 is the equilibrium conformation
and r,-,~ and r3. are distance vectors between nodes i and j in the respective
conformations. The force constant is given by

ar—b, for r < d
H”, for r 3 d

W) = l

The following parameters for this equation have been determined by
ﬁtting the ENM to MD simulation results (Hinsen et al., 2000):
a = 8.6 x105;kJmol’1an3, b = 2.39 x105; kJ mot1 mm”; c = 128
kJ nrn4 mol’ld = 0.4 nm.

Adding the potential energy terms for all site pairs and expanding the
result in Taylor series around r0 up to second order we obtain

U(r) = (r — r0)TK(r — r0),

where the force-constant matrix, K, is the matrix of second derivatives of
the ENM potential.

To obtain an effective force-constant matrix for only the atoms in the
aligned core, we follow Carnevale et a]. (2006) and Hinsen et a]. (2000)

R = KAA — KAQKébKQA,

where K A A is the sub-matrix of K corresponding to the aligned sites KQQ

is the sub-matrix corresponding to the non-aligned sites and KQA and

K AQ are the sub-matrices that couple coaligned and non-aligned sites.
Given K, we solve the eigenvalue equation

an = Anqn

to obtain the normal modes q”, which are vectors of size 317 describing
independent deformations, [7 being the number of aligned sites. The
eigenvalues A” represent the energetic cost of these deformations.
The six lowest eigenvalues are 0. They correspond to rotations and trans-
lations of the whole molecule. These trivial modes will not be considered
in our analyses.

The covariance matrix is given by

C=i<’1.

Since some eigenvalues of K are zero, we use the pseudo-inverse

3p76 1
C = Z —qnq;’
n:1 A"

where the sum runs over the 3p 7 6 non-trivial modes. The normal modes
are also the principal components of the distribution describing protein
ﬂuctuations. They are the eigenvectors of C identical to those of K, with
eigenvalues 03 2 UL, that represent the positional variance or ﬂuctu-
ations in the direction of these deformations.

2.3.2 Comparing properties of the structural core When com-
paring pairs of covariance matrices, they were ﬁrst transformed to a
common frame of reference in which the RMSD over the Ca positions
in the structural core of the two protein domains is minimized.

2.4 (Dis)similarity measures

To calculate a score quantifying the (dis)similarity between pairs of pro-
teins, we need a property to compare, described in the previous section,
and a measure of (dis)similarity, discussed here.

2.4.] The root mean square deviation The similarity of native
structure coordinates is quantiﬁed using the optimal RMSD over the
aligned sites. RMSD is a dissimilarity measure that varies between 0
and 00.

2.4.2 The Spearman correlation coeﬂicient ( ,0 ) The similarity of
backbone ﬂuctuation proﬁles is quantiﬁed using the Spearman correl-
ation coefﬁcient between the aligned RMSF proﬁles. p is a similarity
measure that varies between —1 and 1.

2.4.3 The root mean square inner product The RMSIP is a meas-
ure of similarity of the N principal components of the covariance/correl-
ation matrices

N N 1/2

2 (Un ‘ me
RMSIP = "=1m=1

N , (6)

where the columns of matrices U and V are the principal components of
the covariance or correlation matrices compared. Following common
practice, N is arbitrarily chosen to be 10. RMSIP is a similarity measure
that varies between 0 and 1.

2.4.4 The root weighted square inner product The RWSIP be-
tween two sets of principal components, introduced by Carnevale et a].
(2007), is as follows:

RWSIP: L , (7)

where u” and vm are the eigenvalues of the covariance/correlation
matrix corresponding to principal components U,, and Vm, respect-
ively. N: |U| = |V|, the number of non-trivial principal compo-
nents in either set. RWSIP is a similarity measure that varies between
0 and 1.

2.4.5 The normalized Bhattacharyya distance (NDB) The
Bhattacharyya distance (Bhattacharyya, 1943), DB measures the overlap
between two, distributions. Within the ENM model, the probability dens-
ity function that characterizes the distribution of ﬂuctuations around
the equilibrium conformation is a multivariate normal distribution with
covariance matrix C and mean <8r>=0. The DB between two such
distributions is given by

1 [ |D| ]
DB =—l11 —l ,
2 (iCAiiCBir

where CA and CB are the covariance matrices of the distributions com-
pared, D : (CA + CB)/2 and le denotes the determinant of X. DB is a
dissimilarity measure that varies between 0 and 00.

Before calculating DB we normalize the covariance matrices for the
proteins to be compared, by dividing them by their trace: C —> C /tr(C).

The derivation of DB assumes that the covariance matrices are
positive-deﬁnite matrices. Since we have six trivial modes (eigenvectors
with eigenvalue 0), we projected the covariance matrices onto a common
lower-dimensional representation using

C = QTCQ,
where C is CA or CB, and the columns of Q are the s eigenvectors of

(C A + CB)/2 with highest variances. Here we choose s to be the lowest
number that includes enough eigenvectors to explain 95% of the total

variance. We deﬁne a rank-normalized version of DB that eliminates the
dependency on s:

1/2
NDB =  (8)

Note that, as the ENM is not parameterized to reproduce the ﬂuctu-
ations to scale, all the measures that compare covariance matrices or
RMSF-proﬁles apply amplitude normalization as speciﬁed above, so
that only relative amplitudes are compared.

2.5 Assessment

We assessed the performance of all the (dis)similarity scores studied, by
evaluating their consistency with the SCOP classiﬁcation at the superfam-
ily level. SCOP is an expert classiﬁcation-based mainly on visual inspec-
tion of protein structures (Murzin et al., 1995). It is a hierarchical system
with four levels: class, fold, superfamily and family. Fold-related proteins
are structurally similar but not homologous, whereas superfamily and
family-related proteins are, respectively, probably homologous and
clearly homologous, as suggested by sequence or functional similarity.

To quantify the performance of a given (dis)similarity score, we calcu-
late the proportion of cases for which it ranks domains in agreement with
SCOP. Consider a triplet of protein domains (d1, d2 and d3) with the ﬁrst
two being members of the same superfamily and the third of a different
superfamily within the same fold. A given measure is consistent with
SCOP for this triplet if the (dis)similarity between all and d2 is (smaller)
larger than between all and d3. The number of correctly ranked triplets
is the Mann7Whitney statistic comparing the distributions of (dis)simi-
larity scores with respect to all in the two superfamilies. Expressed as
a proportion this statistic is the area under the curve (AUC) of a
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve obtained using the studied
measure to classify domains according to their (dis)similarity with all
(Hanley and McNeil, 1982). Therefore, we will designate the consistency
measure AUC:

AUC = 4 Z Z H(m(d1, d2) — moi, d3»,

I
 I dzESdzES/

where S is the set of domains in a dataset that are in the same superfamily
as all (except d1 itself), S’ is the set of domains not belonging to the same
superfamily as all, m is a similarity measure, |X| denotes the cardinality of
X and H evaluates to 1 if its argument is positive, 0 if it is negative and 1 /2
if it is 0. For a dissimilarity measure the logic of H is reversed. We thus
calculate an AUC for each domain, similar to how sequence matches are
evaluated in Gribskov and Robinson (1996). This is referred to as an
element-wise ranking scenario in Sonego et a]. (2008). We estimate the
consistency in a superfamily by averaging the AUC values for the do-
mains in the superfamily. An overall consistency value is obtained by
averaging over the superfamily-speciﬁc values.

The AUC values for each domain all in a superfamily are approxi-
mately normally distributed, with means and variances derived from the
distribution of the Mann7Whitney statistic (Mann and Whitney, 1947).
The approximation to normality is further justiﬁed when we consider the
averages of these nearly identically distributed AUC values. When calcu-
lating statistical signiﬁcance, we therefore approximate the distribution of
the average AUC values by a normal distribution with mean and variance
estimated from the sample.

3 RESULTS

We performed a comparative assessment of different scores of
(dis)similarity of protein ﬂuctuation patterns. To this end, and

Comparing and measuring structural fluctuation patterns

 

 

Fig. 1. Aligned structures. Superimposed protein domains for each dataset (a.4 DNA/RNA-binding 3-helical bundle, b.1 Immunoglobulin-like
beta-sandwich, c.1 TIM beta/alpha-barrel, d.15 beta Grasp (ubiquitin-like). The backbone of each domain is shown with lines. One representative
from each dataset is represented using cartoons and red spheres for Cut-atoms included in the structural core. Number of sites in alignment (smallest
domain) is as follows: a.4: 14 (49), b.1: 30 (72), c.1: 33 (184) and d.15: 34 (73).

as described in Section 2, we

(1) chose four datasets, each of them including protein do-
mains from l-fold represented by two different SCOP
superfamilies;

(2) obtained a multiple structural alignment of all proteins in
each dataset from which we extract the conserved struc-
tural core;

(3) produced pairwise superimpositions of all proteins within
a dataset;

(4) calculated properties that characterise the ﬂuctuations of
the aligned core of each protein;

(5) quantified the similarity of such properties with different
(dis)similarity measures and

(6) calculated the consistency of each measure with the SCOP
classiﬁcation.

The aligned and superimposed structures of each of the
four datasets are shown in Figure 1. STAMP captures well
representative residues in the conserved core of the structures
for almost all superfamilies. One exception is the a.4.5 superfam-
ily that is classiﬁed by SCOP in the all-alpha class, although it
has several ﬂ-sheets in the regions corresponding to unstructured
loops in domains of a.4.1. This affects the arrangement of the
adjacent a-helices, causing some counterintuitive matching of
a-helices in a.4.1 with parts of loops and ﬂ-sheets in a.4.5, even
if a central helix is consistently captured across the fold. The core
for a.4 covers 29% of the smallest domain in the alignment. For
the barrel structures (c.1), the obtained conserved core is skewed
to one side of the characteristic barrel, but several spatially ad-
jacent secondary structure elements are well captured by the
alignment procedure.The core for c.1 covers only 18% of the
smallest domain. The core for b.1 and d.15 covers in excess of
40% of the smallest domain. There can certainly be relevant
dynamics in the more peripheral regions of the structures that
can possibly be described by the ENM approach, but for com-
paring the conservation of (dis)similarity measures we regard this
very restrictive definition of the conserved core as suited.

For each pair of proteins in each dataset, we calculated several
similarity and dissimilarity scores. Thus, structural dissimilarity
was quantiﬁed using the RMSD of the coordinates of aligned

Ca-atoms in the native structure. The properties defined by
Equations (1) through (5) were used to characterize the pattern
of ﬂuctuations. All these properties were obtained from the co-
variance matrix, which was calculated using a coarse-grained
ENM. To quantify the (dis)similarity between the covariance
and correlation matrices of different proteins, we used the
three measures deﬁned in Equations 38, while the similarity
of RMSF profiles was quantiﬁed using the Spearman’s correl-
ation coefﬁcient ,0. Each (dis)similarity score is a combination of
a (dis)similarity measure and a property compared, so that the
notation ‘Measure(Property)’ will be used where needed (e.g.
RMSIP(C)). All (dis)similarity scores were calculated using
only the Ca-atoms of sites that are aligned for all proteins of
the same fold.

3.1 Conservation of the covariance matrix

First, we studied whether the covariance matrix, which is a priori
the most informative characterization of the ﬂuctuation pattern,
is evolutionarily conserved. Figure 2 shows that RMSF proﬁles
(left panel) and C (right panel) are more conserved for homolo-
gous (red and green bars) than for non-homologous proteins
(black bars). For homologous proteins, they are more conserved
at the family level (red bars) than at the superfamily level (green
bars). Through analysing the distributions of scores using the
KolmogoroviSmirnov (KS) tests, we found that the differences
are highly statistically signiﬁcant for all the (dis)similarity meas-
ures (P—Values << 1073), both when comparing the distribution of
family-related domains with that of the superfamily-related ones
and when comparing superfamily-related domains with
fold-related domains. Visual inspection of Figure 2 shows that
the dissimilarity measure NDB(C) outperforms the similarity
measure ,0 in discriminating between the different SCOP levels
for all folds considered here. Thus, both RMSF proﬁles and
covariance matrices can be used to characterize the divergence
of protein ﬂuctuation patterns, but covariance matrices do a

3.2 Comparison of different (dis)similarity scores

Next, we compared different ﬂuctuation (dis)similarity scores.
The covariance matrix adds to the RMSF proﬁle information
on the directionality of ﬂuctuations and their covariation

between sites. To disentangle the contributions of overall ﬂuctu-
ation magnitude from that of covariation, we compared covari-
ance matrices with correlation, matrices. To study the effect of
ﬂuctuation directionality, we compared full covariance and cor-
relation matrices with their isotropic counterparts. To compare
the different measures, we evaluated their consistency with SCOP
at the superfamily level as explained in Section 2.5. Consistency
is given as AUC values ranging from 0 to 1, 1 being perfect
agreement and 0.5 being the agreement expected for a random
ranking procedure.

For comparing covariance and correlation matrices we apply
several measures. The RMSIP is widely used for comparing the
consistency of a chosen range of principal components. Ideally,
the exact range should be motivated for each case, which is gen-
erally difﬁcult when dealing with large datasets and more
common than not an arbitrary choice of principal components
is made. This choice is typically 10, as in this study [see for in-
stance Amadei et al. (1999)]. The RWSIP uses a well-motivated
weighting and normalization scheme to avoid the arbitrary
choice of principal components. However, both these measures
lack a rigorous foundation in statistics. For example in the some-
what contrived example of comparing any distribution with a
distribution with exactly equal variance along each principal
component, they have some unsettling properties. The RMSIP
will not be deﬁned in this case since the principal components
cannot be ordered in a meaningful way. The RWSIP, on the
other hand, will evaluate to exactly 1 which is supposed to rep-
resent identity. In contrast, the NDB is well founded in the theory
of multivariate statistics. As explained above, the complication of
comparing distributions with no variance along the roto-
translational components introduces some arbitrary choices of
which principal components to retain, but the effect of this is
supposedly much less severe than with the RMSIP as most of the
information from the covariance matrix can be included.
Looking past the application to elastic network models, although
the formulation of the Bhattacharyya distance that is used here is
adapted to compare Gaussian distributions, the more general
formulation does not require that assumption. In principle, it
can even be used to compare distributions that do not have a
well-defined equilibrium, such as intrinsically disordered regions
of a protein.

3.2.] Overall performance Table 1 shows the overall perform-
ance of all the (dis)similarity scores. Consistency values were
accumulated over all superfamilies except a.4.5 and c.1.2 for
which ﬂuctuation patterns seem to be only mildly conserved,
or poorly captured, as will be shown below. As Table 1 accumu-
lates AUC values obtained for each domain in six superfamilies,
the differences between the measures are best analysed in terms
of paired statistics. We therefore report also the mean difference
between AUC values for the domains when either the similarity
measure or the property compared is varied (Tables 2 and 3).
From theoretical considerations, we expect NDB(C) to perform
best when assessing similarity of ﬂuctuations, so we report dif-
ferences to NDB and C with signiﬁcance values for a paired t—test
with the null hypothesis that this difference is non-positive. We
start by noticing that the assumption of NDB consistently being
best is not supported by our analysis, although it is the best for
the anisotropic covariance matrices, which we preferred a priori
(Table 2). For the isotropic covariances, the difference to RWSIP
is negligible and for both the correlation matrices, the RWSIP
somewhat surprisingly turns out to be the best. Interestingly,
NDB is generally better than the widely used RMSIP, again
with the exception of the anisotropic correlation matrix where
the difference is negligible. No single (dis)similarity measure is
consistently the best, and the differences between RWSIP and
NDB are generally small. As can be seen in Tables 1 and 3, the
property measured is more important for obtaining high consist-
ency with SCOP than the measure used.

From Table 1, we see that the RMSF proﬁle similarity p is
much worse than the structure-based measure RMSD. In con-
trast, the other ﬂuctuation-based measures largely outperform ,0,
showing performances similar to or even higher than RMSD.
Scores based on correlation matrices perform somewhat better
than those based on covariance matrices. This suggests that the
differences observed between comparisons of RMSF profiles and
comparisons of covariance matrices are largely due to the intro-
duction of the correlation between sites. Scores based on C and P
perform better than those based on Cm and PM, respectively,
which means that it is also important to consider the anisotropy
of ﬂuctuations.

In Table 3, we see that considering both inter-residue correl-
ations and anisotropy improve the expected fraction of correctly
ranked protein domains by 10714%, with the addition of
inter-residue correlations alone contributing 446% of this.

To summarize, the directionality of ﬂuctuations and their
correlation between sites have signiﬁcant effects on overall
performance.

3.2.2 Performance for diﬁ’erent superfamilies To gain further
insight into the different methods, we analysed the consistency
of the different scores with SCOP for different superfamilies
(Table 4). In agreement with the previous section, ,0 is much
less consistent with SCOP than the structural dissimilarity
RMSD for all superfamilies except a.4.5 and 0.1.8. The other
ﬂuctuation-based scores, in contrast, are rivalling structural simi-
larity in their agreement with SCOP. For superfamily 0.1.8, the
best ﬂuctuation-based scores show a remarkable improvement
over RMSD.

Further inspection of Table 4 shows that there is no single
score that clearly outperforms all the others for all superfami-
lies. In general, using C and P is better than using their iso-
tropic counterparts, and the correlation matrices perform
slightly better than the covariances, at least in the case of
RWSIP. However, there are exceptions. For a.4.5, for ex-
ample, the best scores are those that do not take into account
any cross-correlations (RMSD and p). This is in agreement
with the observation that some domains in this superfamily
has been counter-intuitively aligned, with the effect that the
similarity of the central helix is reﬂected in RMSD and ,0,
while this local similarity is not reﬂected when the
cross-correlations with the misaligned environment is con-
sidered, leading to consistencies with SCOP of the order of
50%, which is what would be obtained randomly. Another
exception is c.1.2 for which both the RMSF proﬁle and
scores that include the anisotropy of ﬂuctuations perform
very poorly, but signiﬁcant results are obtained using the iso-
tropic correlation matrix. Here again, the alignment produced
by STAMP might not be optimal, although signiﬁcantly better
than for a.4.5. As this alignment is localized to only a part of
the barrel it is plausible that the frame of reference deﬁned
by minimising the RMSD over aligned sites is suboptimal,
possibly explaining that the rotational invariant properties
(Cm and Pi”) in this case perform consistently better than
their anisotropic counterparts. Interestingly, reviewing the
enzyme commission classiﬁcations (http://www.chem.qmul.ac.
uk/iubmb/enzyme/) of the structures compared in c.1 reveals
that our c.1.2 selection is more heterogeneous in terms of
enzyme function than our c.1.8 selection. This can possibly
explain both the low consistencies observed in c.1.2 and the
very high consistencies observed in 0.1.8.

The (dis)similarity measure used (NDB, RWSIP or RMSIP)
has a smaller effect than the matrices compared and depends on
them, which makes it difﬁcult to establish a general trend.
However, it can be seen that NDB and RWSIP are somewhat
better than RMSIP. Keeping in mind these difficulties to gener-
alize, we can say that the best ﬂuctuation-based scores are those
that take into account ﬂuctuation anisotropy and correlation
between sites. These scores have performances rivalling that of
the RMSD, despite the fact that the analysis is slightly biased in
favour of the RMSD, both by the superimposition procedure
and the structural alignment procedure.

Except for some entries in a.4.5 and c.1.2, all results are highly statistically signiﬁcant (P—values << 1073) as assessed with a t—test against the null hypothesis that the mean AUC

is 50.5.

3.3 Complementarity to RMSD

Finally, we investigated the relationship between ﬂuctuation-
based scores and RMSD. Figure 3 shows NDB(C) versus
RMSD for the 4-folds considered here. It can be seen that the
two scores are correlated. The mean Spearman’s correlation co-
efﬁcient over all datasets is r = 0.76. Even though this correlation
is signiﬁcant, there is about 42% of the variance of NDB(C) rank-
ings that is not accounted for by variations in RMSD rankings. If
the unaccounted variance was just noise, we would expect the
performance of NDB(C) to be much lower than that of RMSD.
This, however, is not the case. Inspection of Tables 1 and 4 shows

that NDB(C) is as consistent with SCOP as RMSD or even more.
The analysis yields similar results for other (dis)similarity
measures, which demonstrates that the performance of
ﬂuctuation-based scores is not just a trivial consequence of their
correlation with RMSD. In fact, Table 4 shows that in half of the
superfamilies a ﬂuctuation-based score performs better than
RMSD. Moreover, a detailed analysis shows that for 10% of
the cases for which the NDB(C) ranking agrees with SCOP,
the RMSD ranking does not. Therefore, even though
ﬂuctuation-based scores and RMSD are correlated, they contain
complementary information.

4 CONCLUSIONS

If we quantify the similarity of protein dynamics using p(RMSF)
of the structural core, we find that it is less conserved than struc-
ture (Tables 1 and 4). This has been previously discussed in
studies using p(RMSF) to investigate the evolution of protein
dynamics (Maguid et al., 2006, 2008). However, better
ﬂuctuation-based (dis)similarity scores can be used, which per-
form as well as or even better than the structure-based RMSD.
Using the covariance matrix results in much better separation of
homologous and non-homologous proteins than using RMSF
proﬁles (Fig. 2). The same can also be seen more quantitatively
when measuring the consistency between (dis)similarity measures
and SCOP. The scores accounting for anisotropy and correl-
ations between residues (comparing C and P matrices) have
much better performances than the comparison of RMSF pro-
ﬁles, even rivalling that obtained with RMSD (Table 1).
Moreover, the good performance of such ﬂuctuation-based
measures is not a trivial consequence of structural similarity.
Even though there is a high correlation between the
ﬂuctuation-based measures and RMSD, there are many cases
in which a chosen ﬂuctuation-based measure agrees with
SCOP, when RMSD does not. The reverse is also true, support-
ing the idea that ﬂuctuation-based measures and structure-based
measures are complementary, in agreement with previous studies
(Maguid et al., 2006, 2008; Pandini et al., 2007; Zen et al., 2008).
The key to a good ﬂuctuation-based (dis)similarity score is to
take into consideration the correlation of ﬂuctuations between
sites and their directionality. This is in agreement with work in
which dynamical similarity measures are based on the

conservation of the lowest normal modes, which are the principal
components of the covariance matrix (Maguid et al., 2005, 2008;
Zen et al., 2008). In addition to expressing a property of the
ﬂuctuations that takes into account cross-correlations and direc-
tionality, the measure of (dis)similarity used (NDB, RWSIP or
RMSIP) also has an effect, but this is smaller and less consistent.

We also learn from the folds for which we found the alignment
to be counter-intuitive or not capturing representative residues
from all parts of the core, that the measures that quantify simi-
larity of cross-correlations are sensitive to the quality of the
alignments. Measures that take into account the directionality
of ﬂuctuations will also necessarily be dependent on a good def-
inition of a common frame of reference for compared domains.

To summarize, the best scores are those based on properties
that inform on the anisotropy of ﬂuctuations and their correl-
ation between sites. The similarity score most used in evolution-
ary studies of conservation of protein ﬂuctuations has so far been
p(RMSF) (Maguid et al., 2006, 2008; Pandini et al., 2007), fol-
lowed by RMSIP(C) (e.g. Zen et al. (2008)). From the present
study it follows that better scores are NDB(C) and RWSIPG’). In
particular, NDB is founded in the theory of multivariate statistics
and works as well on the better motivated covariance matrices as
on the correlation matrices. In their consistency with the SCOP
classiﬁcation, these measures are as good as, or even better than
RMSD. This supports and complements previous reports on the
evolutionary conservation of protein ﬂuctuations (Maguid et al.,
2006, 2008; Pandini et al., 2007; Zen et al., 2008).

Although the use of p(RMSF) would indicate that protein
structural ﬂuctuations are less conserved than the native struc-
ture, the strategy we propose demonstrates a higher conservation
of protein dynamics, notably by taking into account the covari-
ance or correlation of movements within domains.

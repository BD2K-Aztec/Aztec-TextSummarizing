ABSTRACT

Summary: The generation of large volumes of omics data to conduct
exploratory studies has become feasible and is now extensively used
to gain new insights in life sciences. The effective exploration of the
generated data by experts is a crucial step for the successful extrac-
tion of knowledge from these datasets. This requires availability of
intuitive and interactive visualization tools that can display complex
data. Matrix heatmaps are graphical representations frequently used
for the description of complex omics data. Here, we present
jHeatmap, a web-based tool that allows interactive matrix heatmap
visualization and exploration. It is an adaptable javascript library
designed to be embedded by means of basic coding skills into web
portals to visualize data matrices as interactive and customizable
heatmaps.

Availability: jHeatmap is freely available at the GitHub code repository
at https://github.com/Jheatmap/jheatmap. Working examples and the
documentation may be found at httpMheatmapgithub.ioﬂheatmap.

1 INTRODUCTION

The need for effective tools for data Visualization is rising with the
increasing data volumes generated by scientiﬁc studies. Effective
data Visualization lets the researcher understand his/her data at
both broad and detailed levels and enables barrier-free explor-
ation of the datasets. A widely used type of Visualization to report
biological results are matrix heatmaps, which represent a dataset
with two dimensions, commonly genes and samples. The values in
the matrix may represent any widely measurable property such as
expression values. The static nature of such plots is a limiting
factor to explore complex datasets. Therefore, we introduced
the use of interactive heatmaps and developed Gitools, a desktop
application for this purpose (Perez-Llamas and Lopez-Bigas,
2011). With jHeatmap, we provide a javascript library that can
be included in any web platform to interactively explore heatmaps
over a web browser without any further software barriers. This
could be compared with the creation of Cytoscape-Web (Lopes
et al., 2010), which maintains basic features for network Visual-
ization of Cytoscape desktop application. The data are Visualized
in a heatmap matrix that can contain multiple values per cell and

thus allows loading multidimensional datasets such as alteration
data from oncogenomic study cohorts. Each cell is associated
with two features, e. g. genes and samples, with additional infor-
mation, e.g. clinical information for samples, and a set of values.
Columns and rows can be moved freely, and can be filtered and
sorted based on values in the cells or based on annotations. All of
the properties associated with rows and columns can be color
coded or printed as text.

2 USAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION

jHeatmap is a JavaScript plug-in for jQuery and has to be refer-
enced only from within an HTML ﬁle with the necessary con-
ﬁguration linking the data matrix ﬁle and the Visualization
options. The browser will load the data and draw the heatmap
in the web browser as desired.

As depicted in Figure l, the heatmap has four components: the
matrix heatmap, labels and color annotations for columns on top
and for rows to the left and right and finally a control area on the
top left. In the control area, the user may select whatever value is
displayed in case the cells, rows or columns are associated with
multiple values. For each of the three areas, a drop-down menu
reveals to the user the different values that are available for cells,
rows or columns, respectively. Columns and rows can be se-
lected, moved, sorted and hidden, which gives the user great
ﬂexibility to focus on the data points of interest. Columns and
rows can be selected by click and drag actions. Clicking on Q
will sort the matrix by the selected rows or columns. Rows and
columns used for sorting will be labeled with triangles (A V)
indicating the order applied, and clicking them will toggle the
direction. The row and column annotations offer the same pos-
sibility. Further interactions can be accessed through a context-
ual menu revealed by a long click on the row or column labels.

jHeatmap is designed for incorporation into web portals and
applications. Documentation about several extension points can
be found at the jHeatmap Web site.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Given the possibility to generate large amount of biological data
with high-throughput technologies, the need for data Visualiza-
tion and analysis in biology is increasing. The shift from hypoth-
esis-driven to data-driven analyses requires field experts to
directly access the data. The Visual and interactive access to com-
plex data enables experts to reason and decide over further ana-
lytical procedures. For example, in cancer genomics, researchers

Fig. 1. A jHeatmap screenshot with available pop-ups and annotation. The heatmap shows that the expression status of some genes (rows, low
expression in violet, high in yellow) in the The Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma samples (columns) depends on the tumor subtype as, for example,
seen for the genes EGFR and TRIP6. The three drop-down menus in the control area allow changing the value that is displayed in the cells, rows and
columns. The cell information pop-up reveals all values of the choked cell, in this case Genomic Alteration, Mutation and Copy Number Status and
Expression. The contextual menu revealed at the top-right in the ﬁgure offers interactions over the heatmap

need to Visualize and analyze complex multidimensional genomic
data often of large number of patients (Schroeder et al., 2013).

For the above stated reasons, we present the jHeatmap soft-
ware library for easy representation of big datasets. jHeatmap is
already in use within the IntOGen platform (Gonzalez-Perez
et al., 2013; Gundem et al., 2010), the Achilles Project (Cheung
et al., 2011) and GenomeSpace (Liefeld, 2013) web platforms.
jHeatmap is open source, reusable and extendable. The web cre-
ator may easily include the library to existing projects to Visualize
multidimensional datasets of any size. Basic coding skills are
required. For more advanced users, it is possible to adapt and
extend the code as needed.

With jHeatmap, we complement already existing stand-alone
desktop solutions for interactive heatmaps such as Gitools
(Perez-Llamas and Lopez-Bigas, 2011) or Java TreeView
(Saldanha, 2004) with an open source matrix heatmap Visualizer
prepared for integration into webs. jHeatmap offers a set of ac-
tions to provide an interactivity that allows the user to Visually
mine the data. According to the defined software interactions W i
et al., 2007), jHeatmap lets the user select, explore, reconﬁgure,
encode and filter rows, columns and cells of the heatmap.

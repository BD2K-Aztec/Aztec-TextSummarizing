ABSTRACT

Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used for isotopic labeling
studies of metabolism and other biological processes. Quantitative
applications—e.g. metabolic flux analysis—require tools to correct
the raw MS data for the contribution of all naturally abundant
isotopes. IsoCor is a software that allows such correction to be
applied to any chemical species. Hence it can be used to exploit
any isotopic tracer, from well-known (‘30, “N, 180, etc) to unusual
(57Fe, 778e, etc) isotopes. It also provides new features—e.g.
correction for the isotopic purity of the tracer—to improve the
accuracy of quantitative isotopic studies, and implements an efficient
algorithm to process large datasets. Its user-friendly interface makes
isotope labeling experiments more accessible to a wider biological
community.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mass spectrometry (MS) is extensively used for stable isotopic
studies of metabolism. During the last decade, quantitative
approaches—such as 13C metabolic ﬂux analysis—have been
increasingly used in the ﬁelds of systems biology and biotechnology
to provide novel biological insights and improve industrial processes
(Nicolas et al., 2007; Sauer, 2006). In such experiments, the different
labeled forms—or isotopologues—of metabolites are quantiﬁed by
the ﬁne exploitation of isotopic clusters in MS spectra (Kiefer et al.,
2007). These clusters also contain information on all other isotopes
that occur naturally in the molecules. To extract meaningful labeling
information—i.e. isotopologue distribution—the contribution of
naturally occurring isotopes ﬁrst has to be subtracted. This can be
achieved using publicly available software such as MSCorr (Wahl
et (11., 2004) developed under MATLAB or the algorithm developed
in Perl by (Moseley, 2010). However, the former software is only
applicable to 13C-labeling experiments and the latter is restricted to
the correction of ultra-high resolution MS data for natural abundance
of 13C or 15N.

Here, we present a novel software to correct MS data, IsoCor,
which includes the following features:

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

0 Correction for any chemical element, thereby extending the
range of isotopic tracers—from well-known (13C, 15N) to
unusual (57Fe, 77 Se, etc) isotopes—and chemical species that
can be investigated. Tracer elements with more than two
isotopes (e.g. 16O, 17O, 18O) can be considered.

0 When metabolite derivatization is required for analytical
purposes [e.g. derivatization of amino acids for GC-MS
analysis (Wittmann, 2007)], IsoCor performs appropriate
correction by taking into account the contribution of naturally
occurring isotopes brought by the derivatization reagent.

0 IsoCor provides two options that allow ﬂexible correction
of isotopic clusters to account for (or not) the composition
of the label input including: (i) correction for the isotopic
purity of the label input and (ii) correction for the occurrence
of unlabeled positions in the label input. These options
are of particular value for speciﬁc applications (Rodriguez-
Castrillon et (11., 2008; Wittmann and Heinzle, 1999).

IsoCor calculates the mean isotopic enrichment of molecules,
which refers to the molecular content in the isotope. This
information is particularly useﬁil for targeted metabolic
investigations, such as the quantiﬁcation of split ratios
between two metabolic pathways.

0 IsoCor can be applied to large datasets and can deal with the
increasing number of data that are generated with modern
methods in a single experiment.

2 METHOD AND IMPLEMENTATION

The correction is performed with the matrix-based method introduced by
(van Winden et al.. 2002). which requires solving the following equation:

1Com 2 CM—l ‘ICmem 

where ICC”, denotes the corrected isotopic cluster. CM is a correction matrix
and ICmgm is the measured isotopic cluster.

This formalism has been implemented in Python programming language
(http://python.org) which enables seamless usage of IsoCor on Windows.
MacOS. Linux and other platforms supporting Python.

2.1 Construction of the correction matrix

The size of the correction matrix is m X n. with m 3 n. where m is the length of
the measured isotopic cluster and n is the number of isotopologues. i.e. a + l
where a is the number of atoms of the tracer element in the molecule. The
i-th column of the correction matrix (1 5 i 5 n) is the isotopic cluster of the
molecule containing 1' - 1 atoms of the tracer. It is commonly calculated using

combinatorial probabilities (Hellerstein and Neese. 1999). For molecules
containing a high number of atoms. the number of possible combinations to
be calculated is high which can cause a bottleneck in the correction process.
In probability theory. the probability distribution of the sum of independent
variables is the convolution of their individual distributions. Therefore. the
calculation can be performed faster by iteratively convolving the isotopic
vectors VA = [p(A(l)).. . ..p(A(x))] of all the atomsgexcept those of the label
traceriwhere p(A(x)) denotes the natural abundance of the x-th isotope of
the atom A. Finally. the contribution of the tracer is added by convolving
the previous isotopic cluster 1' - 1 times by the purity vector of the tracer (e.g.
[0.01. 0.99] for a purity of 99%). and n - 1' times by its natural abundance (e. g.
[0.9893, 0.0107] in a l3C-labeling experiment) when it has to be corrected.

2.2 Optimization algorithm

Because the measurement of isotopic clusters contains noise. Equation (1)
has to be solved using a least squares method. This process can result in
biases. such as the calculation of negative isotopic fractions sometimes
observed with MSCorr. Because negative fractions cannot exist. they are just
ﬂattened to 0 in (Moseley. 2010). which can lead to errors in the estimated
parameters and in their interpretation. To avoid such biases. the optimization
method used in IsoCor includes constraints on the isotopic fraction values.
We applied the LiBFGsiB algorithm described in (Byrd et al.. 1995) and
implemented in the 0ptimize.l_bfgs_g() function of the SciPy module. The
cost function of the minimization process is deﬁned as the sum of the
squared weighted errors. The lower boundary of corrected isotopic fractions
is constrained to 0. and the stopping criterion is ﬁxed to 10—10 of relative
reduction in cost value. The ﬁtted isotopologue distribution is normalized
to 1. The residuum vector may be used for an independent quality control
(Moseley. 2010).

The calculation speed and correction accuracy of IsoCor were evaluated
by processing several sets of simulated isotopologues with varying numbers
of tracer atoms (up to 100 to stress the algorithm) and levels of labeling.
The correction was performed after addition of the theoretical contributions
of other naturally abundant elements to these isotopologues. with or without
addition of measurement noise. The implementation was quite robust and
highly accurate in both cases (see the IsoCor tutorial). showing that IsoCor
provides high calculation speed together with high precision. Hence IsoCor
is capable to efﬁciently process the large datasets that can now be acquired
with modern. high-throughput MS technologies. This is critical for high-
throughput metabolomics and even more for high-throughput ﬂuxomics.
which is a current major challenge for many biological applications.

3 USAGE

IsoCor is provided with plain text ﬁles that contain the information
required to perform the correction. The ﬁle Isotopes.dat contains
the values of the natural abundances of isotopes commonly found
in biological compounds (Rosman and Taylor, 1998). The ﬁles
Metabolites.dat and Derivatives.dat contain the elemental formula
of most common metabolites and derivative residues, respectively.
These ﬁles can be easily edited and implemented according to the
user’s needs.

Complete usage of IsoCor is detailed in the tutorial provided
with the software. Figure 1 shows its graphic user interface. Brieﬂy,
the user can load datasets containing one or more isotopic clusters
to be corrected (Panel C). These data ﬁles should be generated
according to the format described in the tutorial. The options—
i.e. selection of the isotopic tracer, correction for the isotopic
purity of the label input, correction for unlabeled positions in the
label input and calculation of mean enrichment—of the correction
process have to be selected (Panel B) before running the calculation.
When correction is applied to single isotopic clusters, the calculated

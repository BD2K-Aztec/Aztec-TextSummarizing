ABSTRACT

Introduction: An increasing number of studies investigates the influ-
ence of local genetic variation on DNA methylation levels, so-called in
cis methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs). A common multiple
testing approach in genome-wide cis meQTL studies limits the false
discovery rate (FDR) among all CpG—SNP pairs to 0.05 and reports on
Cst from the significant CpG—SNP pairs. However, a statistical test
for each CpG is not performed, potentially increasing the proportion of
Cst falsely reported on. Here, we presented an alternative approach
that properly control for multiple testing at the CpG level.

Results: We performed cis meQTL mapping for varying window sizes
using publicly available single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and
450 kb data, extracting the Cst from the significant CpG—SNP
pairs (FDR<0.05). Using a new bait-and-switch simulation approach,
we show that up to 50% of the Cst found in the simulated data may
be false-positive results. We present an alternative two-step multiple
testing approach using the Simes and Benjamini—Hochberg proced-
ures that does control the FDR among the Cst, as conﬁrmed by the
bait-and-switch simulation. This approach indicates the use of window
sizes in cis meQTL mapping studies that are significantly smaller than
commonly adopted.

Discussion: Our approach to cis meQTL mapping properly controls
the FDR at the CpG level, is computationally fast and can also be
applied to cis eQTL studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are widely used to
uncover the genetic basis of complex disease. Disease-associated
genetic variants identiﬁed in GWASs are commonly located in
non-coding regions, leaving the molecular mechanism underlying
the associations unclear (V isscher et al., 2012). The likely mech-
anism involves an effect on transcriptional activity of genes

nearby (cis) or located distantly (trans), for example, by inﬂuen-
cing epigenetic regulation (Mill and Heijmans, 2013). This can be
studied by investigating the relationship between genetic vari-
ation, and epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, and
gene expression. Already, many studies have reported on associ-
ations of speciﬁc genetic variants with variation in gene expres-
sion (expression QTL or eQTLs) (Small et al., 2011; Westra
et al., 2013) and DNA methylation, in particular the methylation
of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides (e. g. Heijmans et al., 2007; Shi
et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2014) (DNA methylation quantitative
trait loci or meQTLs). Creating catalogs of meQTLs and eQTLs
will be instrumental in the discovery of genetic mechanisms
determining DNA methylation and gene expression, the possible
interplay between the two, and eventually the etiology of
common diseases. To achieve this goal, further development of
sound statistical methodology will be important.

Typically in meQTL and eQTL studies, a GWAS (i.e. testing
hundreds of thousands to millions of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms, SNPs) is performed for the level of methylation
of every CpG measured or the level of transcription of every gene
(more generally, for every transcript or exon), respectively,
leading to a vast amount of possible combinations to investigate.
Although we will focus on cis meQTL studies, we note that the
same principles and problems may also apply to cis eQTL
studies. With the recent introduction of the Illumina 450k
DNA methylation array (Bibikova et al., 2011), meQTL studies
have become possible investigating >400 thousand Cst in large
numbers of subjects. To test for associations of methylation at
Cst with genetic variants in cis, that is locally, studies have
been considering SNPs anywhere between 5 (Gutierrez-Arcelus
et al., 2013) to 1000 kb (Gibbs et al., 2010) from measured Cst.
Particularly large window sizes will result in hundreds of millions
statistical tests, and thus brings about a huge multiple testing
problem. A common strategy to account for multiple testing in
meQTL studies is to control the false discovery rate
(FDR; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) of all signiﬁcantly
associated CpGiSNP pairs at 0.05 (e.g. Drong et al., 2013;
Grundberg et al., 2013). This means that 5% of all signiﬁcantly
associated CpGiSNP pairs are expected to be false-positive
results.

Owing to the extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the
human genome, individual Cst will frequently be associated
with many SNPs. Hence, a particular CpG will often occur many

times in the list of signiﬁcant CpGiSNP pairs. In practice, this is
redundant information because LD structure renders it impos-
sible to pinpoint the causal SNP responsible for the variation in
DNA methylation using statistical means (of. GWAS; Feero
et al., 2010; Pearson and Manolio, 2008). Hence, the results re-
ported on and further analyses generally focus on the Cst in
the list of signiﬁcant CpG-SNP associations, i.e. all Cst that
significantly associate with at least one SNP (e. g. Liu et al., 2013;
van Eijk et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2010). We will refer to this
approach as the CpGiSNP pair-based approach.

A large proportion of Cst among the FDR signiﬁcant
CpGiSNP pairs may be false-positive results (Bell et al., 2011;
Westra et al., 2013). To obtain a list of Cst inﬂuenced by
genetic variation in cis that is properly controlled for multiple
testing, we propose to formally test each CpG, obtaining a single
valid P-Value per CpG and control the FDR among those P-
values, which we will refer to as the CpG-based approach. Using
a new bait-and-switch simulation scheme, we compare the
proportion of falsely identiﬁed Cst using the CpGiSNP
pair-based approach and our proposed CpG-based approach
in simulated data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data

We used Illumina 450k DNA methylation data (Heyn et al., 2013) and
Illumina HumanHap 550k SNP data (Niu et al., 2010) on 96 unrelated
healthy Caucasian Americans. The DNA samples were obtained from
lymphoblastoid cell lines included in the Human Variation panel
(sample set HD100CAU; Coriell Cell Repositories). Both datasets are
publicly available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data re-
pository (accession numbers GSE36369 and GSE24260, respectively).
The SNP array data were imputed to 30038 302 SNPs based on the
1000 Genomes Central European (CEU) reference panel and using
IMPUTE v2 (Howie et al., 2009). A dosage value ranging from 0 to 2
reﬂected the uncertainty in the imputation for the imputed SNPs. We
selected SNPs with a minor allele frequency >5%, a minimum call rate of
95% and an imputation quality score of at least 0.4, leaving 6596 758
SNPs for analysis.

The quality control of the 450k array was done based on the signal
intensities and detection P-values. We set any beta values (Du et al.,
2010), a measure of the DNA methylation fraction, with a corresponding
detection P-value< 0.01 to missing. Next, we removed any samples with a
log2 median intensity under 10.5 in either the methylated or the unmethy-
lated signal. In addition, we removed any probes or samples with a call
rate <95%. Finally, we removed probes mapping to the sex chromo-
somes, mapping ambiguously to the genome (Chen et al., 2013), or
with an SNP in the interrogated CpG (MAF> 1% in 1000 Genomes).
These ﬁlters resulted in 423 825 probes left for analysis out of the 482 421
probes on the array targeting CpG sites. The normalization of the 450 kb
data consisted of a correction for background signal, followed by a dye-
bias correction. Both procedures were performed using the methylumi
package (Davis et al., 2013). All further analyses were done using beta
values. To verify that genotype and methylation data were linked to the
correct sample identiﬁed, MixupMapper was used (Westra et al., 2011).
For 77 of the 93 samples remaining after quality control, SNP and methy-
lation data could be linked (Supplementary Tables S] and S2).

2.2 meQTL mapping

We tested all associations between genotypes and methylation of Cst in
cis, that is, locally, deﬁned by window sizes from 1 to 500 kb around each

CpG, calculating the Spearrnan rank correlation between the imputed
dosage values and beta values. To this end, we use the Matrix eQTL
package (Shabalin, 2012). Because the Matrix eQTL package is only
able to calculate the Pearson correlation, which is less robust to outliers
than the Spearrnan rank correlation, we pre-calculated the ranks of the
observed values for all Cst and SNPs as input for Matrix eQTL to
obtain a test on the basis of the Spearrnan correlation. The Matrix eQTL
package provides a list of all CpGisNP pairs tested across all windows
evaluated and the P-values reﬂecting the statistical signiﬁcance of the
associations. Obtaining a list of statistically signiﬁcant CpGisNP pairs
was achieved by limiting the FDR among the CpGisNP pairs to 0.05.

2.3 Obtaining an FDR controlled list of Cst inﬂuenced
by genetic variation

Although the FDR among the CpGisNP pairs is controlled at 0.05,
there is no guarantee that this is also true for the set of Cst among
these pairs. No formal statistical test is performed for each CpG indi-
vidually, testing the global null hypothesis H0 of no association between
the variation in methylation and genetic variation in cis. To obtain a list
of Cst that is controlled at an FDR of 0.05, we proceed as follows.
First, we perform a statistical test to assess the global null hypothesis HQ,-
of no association between a CpG i and the SNPs in cis to obtain one valid
P-value for each CpG. Next, we apply the BenjaminiiHochberg proced-
ure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) to these P-values to obtain an FDR
controlled list of Cst associated with genetic variation. As commonly
used software packages return P-values 1),-J- for all CpGisNP pairs (i, j)
tested, we propose to use the pi!!- to test the global null hypothesis HM.
The Bonferroni correction multiplies the minimum of the observed P-
values in a window by the number of such P-values as follows:

P,-=k,- min (p1,,-,..-,I7k,-,i) (1)

where k,- is the number of SNPs in that window. The Bonferroni correc-
tion is conservative in the case of dependent P-values (like in the case of
LD between SNPs), as the effective number of tests done may be smaller
than the number of tests corrected for by Bonferroni. Hence, we propose
to use the Simes procedure (Simes, 1986) (see Supplementary Materials),
a method developed speciﬁcally to test a global null hypothesis H0. This
method makes the extra assumption of positive dependence among the P-
values, similar to the BenjaminiiHochberg procedure (Goeman and
Solari, 2014). The Simes procedure implicitly takes these dependencies
into account, yielding a less conservative P-value than the Bonferroni
correction. The Simes procedure orders the P-values belonging to CpG
i in ascending order, such that 17(1),,- 5 . . . 5 paw)”; Next, a P-value P,- for
CpG i is calculated by multiplying each pm,- by a smaller factor ki/j and
taking the minimum of these corrected P-values:

k,-
Pi=min{j:7pm,,—} 

Both the Bonferroni procedure and the Simes procedure multiply the
smallest P-value 17(1),,- by k,. However, the Simes procedure multiplies
the larger 1),-J- by a smaller factor, making the Simes procedure a more
liberal procedure in the case of positively correlated P-values.

2.4 Estimating the CpG-level false discovery proportion
in a simulated setting using the bait-and-switch
simulation procedure

We have discussed two approaches for compiling a list of Cst inﬂu-
enced by genetic variation: the CpGisNP pair-based approach and our
CpG-based approach. We will now discuss a novel data-based simulation
scheme called the bait-and-switch simulation to provide an assessment of
the performance of these approaches in terms of the proportion of Cst
falsely identified as being signiﬁcantly associated with genetic variation in
a realistic simulation setting. Because simulation of realistic genome-wide

genotype and methylation data is hard to do from scratch, we choose to
modify the current dataset in such a way that we have knowledge of what
null hypotheses are true, i.e. which Cst should not associate with any
genetic variation. This simulation consists of several steps and is depicted
in Figure 2A:

(1) Within-window correction: perform the Simes correction within
each CpG’s window separately. Take the minimum adjusted P-
value as the P-value for this CpG.

(2) Between-windows correction: control the FDR among the newly
calculated P-values to obtain a list of FDR signiﬁcant Cst.

(3) The data consisting of FDR signiﬁcant Cst will be called the bait
set. The rest of the data, the non-signiﬁcant Cst, are called the
switch set.

(4) Perrnute the methylation values for the switch set, leaving the data
in the bait set and the genotype data intact.

(5) Perform the CpGisNP pair-based approach and the CpG-based
approach on the simulated data, obtaining a list of signiﬁcant
Cst for each approach.

To get an estimate of the CpG-level FDR, we calculate the proportion of
the Cst obtained in step 3 coming from the switch set. Although we do
not know which of the Cst in the bait set are truly associated with genetic
variation, we do know that none of the Cst in the switch set have any
such association. As a result, the calculated FDP is a lower bound. The
CpG-level FDR is the average of the different realizations of the FDP
coming from many repetitions of the same simulation experiment.

3 RESULTS

3.1 CpG—SNP pair-based meQTL mapping approach

We performed cis meQTL mapping, varying the window size from
1 to 500 kb. For each window size, we applied the the CpGiSNP
pair-based approach, obtaining a list of statistically signiﬁcant
CpGiSNP pairs and a list of the Cst among these CpGiSNP
pairs, i.e. the Cst that are associated with at least one SNP.
Despite the relatively small sample size, Figure 1 shows that the
BenjaminiiHochberg method ﬁnds an increasing number of
CpGiSNP pairs with increasing window size, with a maximum
of 223 428 CpGiSNP pairs at a 200 kb window and a maximum of
10034 Cst at the 100 kb window size. If we keep expanding the
search window around each CpG, the multiple testing burden
becomes too great, leading to a slight decrease in the number of
CpGPSNP pairs and Cst in that list. The increase in the number
of CpGiSNP pairs can be mainly attributed to LD. When obser-
ving a statistically signiﬁcant CpGiSNP pair, LD may Virtually
guarantee ﬁnding more signiﬁcant CpGiSNP pairs if that SNP is
strongly correlated to other nearby SNPs and we expand the
window around each CpG. This is illustrated by the
LocusZoom plot (Pruim et al., 2010) for a CpG (cg12247378)
associated with several SNPs on 22q13.1 in Figure 1B. Many of
the SNPs associated with this CpG are in LD and will be included
with an increasing window size.

3.2 Evaluating the CpG-level false discovery proportion in
a simulated setting using the bait-and-switch
simulation

LD causes identiﬁcation of the causal SNP responsible for the
variation in methylation to be impossible by statistical means.

Therefore, it would be more insightful to consider individual
Cst only, instead of focusing on all CpGiSNP pairs.
Following the CpGiSNP pair-based approach, we report on
the Cst from the FDR signiﬁcant CpGiSNP pairs found
(see Fig. 1), i.e. the Cst that associate with at least one SNP.
However, this set of Cst has no guarantee of FDR control and
likely includes many false-positive Cst.

To evaluate the CpG-level FDP in a controlled setting, we use
the bait-and-switch simulation scheme. We construct a new
simulated dataset that is similar to the original data, but allows
us to compute a lower bound on the FDP among the Cst.
Performing the CpGiSNP pair-based approach for varying
window sizes on the simulated dataset yields a list of Cst
associated with at least one SNP and a list of all CpGiSNP
pairs at an FDR of 0.05, similar to the results in Figure 1A. In
the simulated dataset, we know for which Cst we permuted the
methylation values and thus are false-positive ones (see Fig. 2B).
Strikingly, a large portion of the identiﬁed Cst using the CpG7
SNP pair-based approach seems to be false-positive results, es-
pecially for larger window sizes (Fig. 2). Even when using a small
0.5 kb window size, we find an estimated FDP of 0.1
(SE = 0.0006, based on five permutations), meaning at least
10% of the Cst found among the CpGiSNP pairs in the
simulated data are coming from the permuted switch set, i.e.
are not truly associated with an SNP. This number greatly in-
creases to 49.1% (FDP = 0.49, SE = 0.002, based on five per-
mutations) for the 500 kb window size. Although we can only
claim that up to 50% of the Cst found in the simulated data
are false-positive results, this approach will probably yield an
inﬂated proportion of falsely identified Cst in the original
data too. Our proposed CpG-based approach, however, controls
the FDP at 0.05 (SE 000170.005, based on ﬁve permutations) for
all window sizes.

3.3 A FDR controlled list of Cst inﬂuenced by
genetic variation

To obtain a valid list of Cst that are signiﬁcantly associated
with genetic variation in cis in the original data, we calculated
one P-Value per CpG, testing the global hypothesis of no asso-
ciation between variation in methylation and any of the SNPs in
its window. We calculated these P-Values by means of the Simes
procedure. The Simes procedure implicitly takes into account the
correlation structure among the SNPs, making it a more power-
ful method than, e. g. the conservative Bonferroni method. After
this within-window correction, we applied the Benjaminii
Hochberg procedure to the resulting P-Values, controlling the
FDR among the Cst to 0.05. Figure 1A shows that this ap-
proach identifies a maximum of 3721 Cst at a 500 bp window
size (black line, triangles). This suggests that strongly associated
SNPs are often in close proximity to the CpG, as reported earlier
(Bell et al., 2011; Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2013). To show that
this approach does control the FDP among the Cst at the
desired level, we again conducted the same bait-and-switch simu-
lation experiment, applying our proposed CpG-based approach
on the simulated dataset. While our approach seemingly dis-
covers fewer Cst than the CpGiSNP pair-based approach to
meQTL mapping when applied to the original data, the FDR

4 DISCUSSION

We report on a CpG-based multiple testing approach in meQTL
mapping to identify individual Cst whose methylation level is
inﬂuenced by genetic variation in cis. Our approach is based on
the application of the Simes procedure within a window around
each CpG to obtain a single P-Value per CpG, followed by the

BenjaminiiHochberg procedure to control the FDR across
Cst. Strikingly, this approach suggests that optimal window
sizes for the identiﬁcation of cis meQTLs are much smaller than
frequently used in the literature (up to tens of kb instead of
hundreds of kb). These smaller window sizes are in line with
reports that SNPs strongly associated with a CpG are often in
close proximity to the CpG (Bell et al., 2011; Gutierrez-Arcelus
et al., 2013). The large window sizes used in literature may stem
from the CpGiSNP pair-based approach reporting on the Cst
from a list of all FDR significant CpGiSNP pairs. Using the

bait-and-switch simulation, we show that the latter approach
yields up to 50% falsely identiﬁed Cst in simulated data.
Our proposed approach controls the CpG-level FDR at the
desired level and still identiﬁes a substantial number of Cst
associated with genetic variation in cis.

Our method can be directly applied to the output of com-
monly used QTL mapping software, e.g. Matrix EQTL, which
returns P-Values corresponding to every CpGiSNP pair tested.
In addition, the current method does not require the use of per-
mutations to control the FDR, making it a fast and easy-to-use
approach. Although permutations are still feasible for small
450 k array datasets, this becomes burdensome for large datasets,

particularly when using bisulphite-sequencing data measuring
millions of CpG sites.

When calculating one P-Value for the window around each
CpG site, it is important to account for LD between SNPs in
the window. Not doing so will substantially reduce statistical
power. Therefore, some methods, like the Bonferroni correction,
may be too conservative. The Simes procedure implicitly takes
LD into account by multiplying larger P-Values with smaller
factors. Although the Simes procedure seems to perform well
in terms of Cst found, it still does not fully capture the cor-
relation structure. A possible solution would be to estimate the
number of independent tests for each window, e. g. using GATES

(Li et al., 2011) or TATES (van der Sluis et al., 2013), accounting
for the number of independent tests done. However, this may be
computationally expensive. Our proposed approach is unable to
distinguish between two independent SNP effects on the methy-
lation levels of a CpG. It only allows for making claims about the
global null hypothesis of no association with any genetic variant
in cis. This approach takes into account that the causal variant
cannot be identified with statistical means only. Another limita-
tion is that currently there is no valid method to determine the
optimal window size for a study before QTL mapping. In gen-
eral, the optimal window size will be greater for studies with
higher statistical power. Our study suggests that the optimal
window size will be 1&50 kb instead of the commonly used hun-
dreds of kb, which will reduce statistical power by dramatically
increasing the number of tests.

In this article, we introduced the bait-and-switch simulation
method to estimate the true false discovery proportion among
Cst with a meQTL in cis in simulated data. This approach
indicated up to 50% of identiﬁed Cst in our simulated data
may be false positive. While we know this is true in the simulated
data, we cannot extrapolate this to the original data. It is likely
that the common approach to multiple testing also brings about
an increased CpG level FDR in the real data. This finding may
also be an issue for cis expression QTL studies and possibly trans
QTL studies. Interpretation of results based on the common
approach evaluated here should be interpreted with caution.

Development of statistical methodology will aid in getting a
complete catalog of meQTLs and eQTLs that is key in under-
standing the mechanisms underlying the association of non-
coding genetic variants with disease phenotypes.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Plant long non-coding RNA database (PanDB) attempts
to provide the following functions related to long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs): (i) Genomic information for a large number of lncRNAs
collected from various resources; (ii) an online genome browser for
plant lncRNAs based on a platform similar to that of the UCSC
Genome Browser; (iii) Integration of transcriptome datasets derived
from various samples including different tissues, developmental
stages, mutants and stress treatments; and (iv) A list of epigenetic
modiﬁcation datasets and small RNA datasets. Currently, our
PanDB provides a comprehensive genomic view of Arabidopsis
lncRNAs for the plant research community. This database will be regu-
larly updated with new plant genome when available so as to greatly
facilitate future investigations on plant lncRNAs.

Availability: PanDB is freely accessible at http://chualab.rockefeller.
edu/gbrowse2/homepagehtml and all results can be downloaded for
free at the website.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a family of RNAs that do not
encode proteins. On the basis of their length and genomic loca-
tions, ncRNAs can be further classiﬁed as (i) small ncRNAs
including miRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs); (ii)
natural antisense transcripts (NATs) (Wang et al., 2005, 2006;
Zhang et al., 2012); (iii) long intronic non-coding RNAs
(incRNAs); and (iv) long intergenic non-coding RNAs
(lincRNAs) (Guttman et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012). RNAs in
the last three categories are at least 200 nt or longer and they are
referred to as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

Genomes of human (Gupta et al., 2010; Khalil et al., 2009),
mouse (Dinger et al., 2008) and ﬂy (Tupy et al., 2005) have been
shown to encode lncRNAs that play important roles in cell dif-
ferentiation, immune response, imprinting, tumor genesis and
other important biological processes (Dinger et al., 2008;
Gupta et al., 2010; Khalil et al., 2009; Liao et al., 2011a;
Wilusz et al., 2009). Besides, genetic mutations of human
lncRNAs have been shown to be associated with diseases and
pathophysiological conditions (Cabianca et al., 2012; Gupta
et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2011).

For plants, genome-wide search for ncRNAs has been previ-
ously conducted in Arabidopsis thaliana (MacIntosh et al., 2001;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Marker et al., 2002; Rymarquis et al., 2008; Song et al., 2009),
Medicago truncatula (Wen et al., 2007), Zea mays (Boerner and
McGinnis, 2012) and Tritucum aestivum (Xin et al., 2011). The
recent genome-wide study based on around 200 Arabidopsis
tilling array datasets and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has
identiﬁed thousands of lncRNAs in Arabidopsis (Liu et al.,
2012). These lncRNAs show tissue-speciﬁc expression, and a
large number of them are responsive to abiotic stresses
(Liu et al., 2012). However, the function of these lncRNAs re-
mains largely unexplored. Genomic loci of many lncRNAs are
associated with histone modiﬁcations and DNA methylations
suggesting an epigenetic regulation of these loci (Guttman
et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012). In addition, biogenesis of a
subgroup of lncRNAs is co-regulated by CBP20, CBP80 and
SERRATE (Liu et al., 2012). Some sense and antisense
double-stranded RNAs involving lncRNA partners are pro-
cessed by the RNA interference machinery into siRNAs
(Zhang et al., 2012).

Although thousands of lncRNAs have been identiﬁed in
Arabidopsis and other plants and their expression has been pro-
filed on a genome-wide basis, these RNAs have not been fully
recorded and annotated in public databases. As far as we
know, there are only seven databases and one server related to
currently available lncRNAs: TAIR (Swarbreck et al., 2008),
PlantNATsDB (Chen et al., 2012), lncRNAdb (Amaral et al.,
2011), NRED (Dinger et al., 2009), ncRNAimprint (Zhang et al.,
2010), NONCODE (Bu et al., 2012) and ncFANs (Liao
et al., 2011b). Among them, only PlantNATsDB (Chen et al.,
2012) is designed to query about NATs pairs; however, this data-
base just lists all NATs pair and does not provide a genome View.
The other six databases are not speciﬁcally designed for plant
lncRNAs (Table 1). Therefore, a database that contains compre-
hensive information related to lncRNAs, such as genomic infor-
mation, expression proﬁles, siRNA information and associated
epigenetic markers is warranted. Here, we attempt to develop an
online database for plant lncRNAs, named PanDB (Plant long
non-coding RNA database), with the aim to provide
comprehensive information for plant lncRNAs. Table 1
compares information content between our database and those
of others.

2 AIMS OF DATABASE

Recent studies in mammalian genomes have shown that
lncRNAs are generally characterized by four interesting features:
(i) eukaryotic genome codes a few thousand lincRNAs
(Cabili et al., 2011; Dinger et al., 2008; Guttman et al., 2009);

(iii) genomic loci encoding lncRNAs are associated with epigen-
etic markers (Guttman et al., 2009; Khalil et al., 2009); (iv) sense

Based on the characteristics of lncRNAs, our PlncDB aims to
provide the following four essential functions: (i) a collection and
integration of lncRNAs from different data resources;
(ii) lncRNA expression levels in various samples including differ-
ent tissues, developmental stages, mutants and stress treatments;
(iii) epi genetic modiﬁcations (e. g. DNA methylations and histone
modiﬁcations) on lncRNA-encoding loci and their ﬂanking gen-
omic regions; and (iv) a collection of siRNA sequencing dataset
across the whole genome (Table 2).

3 DATABASE ACCESS

We constructed a genome browser database using the open
source GBrowse library (Stein et al., 2002) to integrate and Visu-
alize these different sources PanDB. In the case of Arabidopsis,
we have also provided an updated version from TAIR10 with
respect to genomic context, alignment information, protein
coding gene annotation and known ncRNAs. As for lncRNA
expression information, we adopted a new ﬁle format BigWig
(Kent et al., 2010)

to expedite the querying. The database can be accessed or
queried in various ways. Just by clicking on a speciﬁc lncRNA,
one can Visualize related mutant/stress information (Fig. 1).
Speciﬁc searches can be performed using the name/keywords
of gene/protein and/or location on the chromosome. At the
same time the entire database is available for download in
different format on the website.

4 FUNCTION OF THE DATABASE

4.1 An online database to deposit, browse and download
information relating to a large number of lncRNAs

We collected a total of 16 227 Arabidopsis lncRNAs from various
resources published in the past decade (Liu et al., 2012). These
lncRNAs were identiﬁed based on different versions of genome
sequences and were annotated separately using different criteria.
For our Reproducibility-based Tiling array Analysis Strategy
(RepTAS) method, 13466 transcript units (TU) were identiﬁed
(Liu et al., 2012). To provide uniformed and comprehensive in-
formation for Arabidopsis lncRNAs, by comparing the genomic
loci of TUs with exons, pseudogenes, repeat sequences and trans-
posable elements annotated in TAIR10, we finally reclassiﬁed the
remaining TUs into the following six categories: (i) TU encoding
NATs, (ii) Repeats-Containing TUs, (iii) Gene-Associated TU,
(iv) TUs encoding transcripts with long open reading frames sug-
gesting novel protein-coding genes, also named TUs of Unknown
Coding Potential (Cabili et al., 2011); (V) TUs for lincRNAs; (Vi)
Other Intergenic TUs. Recently, using a RepTAS, we identiﬁed
6480 genes encoding lincRNAs (Liu et al., 2012).

4.2 An online genome browser to show lncRNA expression
of various transcriptome data

An interesting feature of lncRNAs is their significant tissue-
speciﬁc expression pattern compared with mRNAs

Fig. 1. Snapshot of PanDB

(Cabili et al., 2011; Dinger et al., 2008). In our previous study, we
profiled transcriptome of Arabidopsis lncRNAs using multiple
platforms including high-throughput RNA-seq, tiling-arrays and
a custom designed long oligonucleotide microarray (Liu et al.,
2012). Dynamic expression patterns of thousands of lncRNA
were found in a number of tissues, developmental time-points,
biotic/abiotic stress conditions and Arabidopsis mutants deﬁ-
cient in several RNA-interacting proteins. It is reasonable to
hypothesize that the expression speciﬁcity of lncRNA may
imply biological functions. Therefore, an online genome browser
with a large set of transcriptome data will be useful to biologists
to further investigate functional roles of the lincRNAs.

In this study, we collected datasets of three transcriptome
detection platforms and analyzed their data quality. The raw
datasets of the selective samples were normalized and
re-analyzed using a uniformed analysis protocol. We then inte-
grated the processed signal intensities into the genome browser
(Fig. 1). The current version of PanDB is version 1.

4.3 An Association of lncRNA-encoding genomic loci with
epigenetic markers

Expression of thousands of lncRNAs is associated with epigen-
etic regulation. Yet, little is known about epigenetic regulations
of lncRNA expression in plants. Two widely used strategies have
been used to proﬁle epigenetic regulation in a genome-wide View:
(i) detection of epigenetic modiﬁcation sites or modiﬁer binding
sites using immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput
detection such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation on chip
(ChIP-chip) and Chip-sequencing (ChIP-seq). (ii) Proﬁling of
transcriptome changes in mutants deﬁcient in epigenetic modi-
ﬁers. In our study, we analyzed ChIP-chip data of the following
histone modiﬁcations (H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and
H3K9me3).

Besides, we also proﬁled expression changes of lncRNAs in a
number of RdRM-related mutants (RDD, DCL1/2/3/4, AGO4,
RDR2 and DMSl) (Fig. 2). These results have been integrated
into the genome browser of PanDB for public access (Figs 1
and 2).

4.4 Sense and antisense double strands are precursor
of siRNA

Sense and antisense transcripts may form double-stranded RNAs
that are subsequently processed by the RNA interference
machinery into siRNAs (Zhang et al., 2012). A few so-called
nat-siRNAs have been reported in plants, mammals,
Drosophila and yeasts. However, many questions remain regard-
ing the features and biogenesis of nat-siRNAs (Luo et al., 2009;
Wang et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2012). For this reason, we also
included our previous small RNAs sequence dataset in this data-
base (Wang et al., 2011).

5 FUTURE DIRECTION

In future, we also plan to include in our database other lncRNA
datasets, like those for intronic non-coding RNAs (incRNAs)
and Natural Antisense RNAs (NATs). Furthermore, informa-
tion on lncRNAs of other plant species, e.g. rice, corn, etc, will
be also included as the data become available.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The use of DNA microarrays allows the monitoring of
the extreme microbial diversity encountered in complex samples like
environmental ones as well as that of their functional capacities.
However, no probe design software currently available is adapted
to easily design efficient and explorative probes for functional gene
arrays.

Results: We present a new efficient functional microarray probe
design algorithm called HiSpOD (High Specific Oligo Design).
This uses individual nucleic sequences or consensus sequences
produced by multiple alignments to design highly specific probes.
Indeed, to bypass crucial problem of cross-hybridizations, probe
specificity is assessed by similarity search against a large formatted
database dedicated to microbial communities containing about 10
million coding sequences (CDS). For experimental validation, a
microarray targeting genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorinated
solvent biodegradation was built. The results obtained from a
contaminated environmental sample proved the specificity and the
sensitivity of probes designed with the HiSpOD program.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microbes mediate almost every conceivable biological process on
the planet. It is estimated that about 1030 bacterial and archaeal
cells are involved in these tremendous metabolic potentialities
(Whitman et (11., 1998). To access to this wide metabolic diversity,
environmental functional gene arrays (FGAs) are high-throughput
tools which allow analyzing the presence or the expression of
thousands of genes encoding key enzymes involved in many
metabolic process in only one experiment. However, designing

DNA microarray probes to encompass the full diversity of gene
family sequences encountered in nature and not yet identiﬁed is
still one of the most difﬁcult Challenges. In addition, the difﬁculty
to obtain sufﬁcient nucleic acid materials for microarray studies
from environmental samples requires the development of highly
sensitive probes. Currently, the most complete FGA available to
monitor bacterial metabolism in complex ecosystems is GeoChip
(He et (11., 2007) with a latest version covering ~47 000 gene
variants from more than 290 gene categories (He et (11., 2008).
GeoChip has already demonstrated its power in assessing in situ
bacterial activity, reinforcing the idea that functional microarray are
an efﬁcient approach (Berthrong et (11., 2009; Kimes et (11., 2010;
Leigh et (11., 2007; Liang et (11., 2009; Mason et (11., 2008; Rhee et (11.,
2004; Van Nostrand et (11., 2009; Wang et (11., 2009; Yergeau et (11.,
2007). However, the main problem that must be faced for functional
microarray applications is the complexity of the oligonucleotide
design step which hinders their development.

Many parameters such as probe length, melting temperature (Tm),
%GC, complexity or still potential cross-hybridizations evaluation
(percent similarity and identity stretch between probe and non-
targeted sequences) must be taken into account to ensure the
selection of the oligonucleotides offering the best compromise
between speciﬁcity and sensitivity (Kane et (11., 2000; Pozhitkov
et (11., 2007). Fortunately, numerous bioinformatics tools, which
estimate most of these parameters, have been developed to
perform this crucial probe design step (Lemoine et (11., 2009).
Currently, the most popular software for FGA probe design are
OligoWiz (Wernersson and Nielsen, 2005), CommOligo (also
named OligoStar) (Li et (11., 2005) or YODA (Nordberg, 2005).
However, these softwares were developed for use on whole-genome
data or on speciﬁc sets of genes (Gentry et (11., 2006; Lemoine et (11.,
2009). So, cross-hybridization research is performed only against
a reduced set of sequences (Li et (11., 2005; Wang and Seed, 2003;
Wernersson and Nielsen, 2005). Thus, probe speciﬁcity must be
Checked against databases containing a very large set of sequences
while staying within a reasonable time for the design.

A second critical obstacle when dealing with environmental
studies is the difﬁculty to design probes able to cover all the gene
variants encoding proteins having a same function (Habe and Omori,
2003). Although Hierarchical Probe Design (Chung et (11., 2005)
and ProDesign (Feng and Tillier, 2007) softwares propose Clustering

methods to identify conserved regions allowing a probe design for
gene families, they are unable to perform the speciﬁcity tests. The
single promising approach to address this problem is implemented in
the PhylArray program (Militon et (11., 2007) which consists in the
design of degenerate probes targeting multiple sequence variants.
This strategy allows the design of probes targeting sequences never
described in international databases and therefore considered as
explorative probes. Unfortunately, this tool is only dedicated to
probe design for phylogenetic microarrays.

Finally, despite the wide range of available programs, few provide
access to oligonucleotide design through a web interface. This
solution is the easiest one since it does not require any local
software installation. Unfortunately, only six softwares offer this
possibility and among them four (OligoFaktory, Osprey, PROBEmer
and ROSO) allow the user to implement its own biological models
for a tailor-made probe design.

Therefore, many improvements in the probe design technology
are still necessary and the HiSpOD (High Speciﬁc Oligo Design)
program was developed to meet these Challenges. In addition to
take into account the crucial parameters for the design of effective
probes, we combine:

0 the possibility to produce speciﬁc probes and also degenerate
probes from consensus sequences, and thus with an explorative
power, in order to detect a broad spectrum of variants from gene
families;

0 the use of a large formatted database dedicated to microbial
communities [all coding DNA sequences (CDSs) from
Prokaryotes (PRO), Fungi (FUN) and Environmental (ENV)
taxonomic divisions of the EMBL databank] to Check
speciﬁcity of selected probes and limit cross-hybridizations;

0 program parallelization in order to optimize the speed of the
design;
0 the oligonucleotide design access through a web interface.

This user-friendly bioinformatics tool is dedicated to probe
design for studying microbial communities. It can also be
applied for all research areas after adaptation of the database
used to search for cross-hybridizations. The algorithm and its
features are discussed and demonstrated with the analyses of a
microarray built from gene sequences encoding enzymes involved
in Chlorinated solvent [tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene
(TCE)] biodegradation. The functional DNA microarrays developed
in this study will be particularly useful to monitor in situ bacterial
capacities on contaminated environments.

2 COMPLETE CDS DATABASE BUILDING

A new database was developed in order to assess the potential
cross-hybridizations of probes designed with HiSpOD by using
non-target sequences present in environmental samples. All
annotated transcript sequences in all Classes of EMBL databank
release 97 of PRO, FUN and ENV taxonomic divisions
(ftp.ebi.aC.uk/pub/databases/embl/release) were extracted using a
Perl script named ‘buildDatabase.p1’. Brieﬂy, the script downloads
compressed ﬁles containing EMBL entries from the EMBL
databank, extracts the CDS from each EMBL entry and their
associated 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTR) ﬁxed by default as
the 300 upstream and downstream bases to the CDS. Indeed, UTRs

were considered to avoid cross-hybridizations because they are
components of mRNA sequences. To obtain a suitable and curated
database, a ﬁltering step is carried out to ensure that sequences with
bad quality were rejected if:

(1) The percentage of N (unknown base) in the sequence is
>10%.

(2) At least one stretch of 10 consecutive N is detected.

The data extracted are then saved into a relational database
implemented under Oracle and named EnvExBase. Finally, the
whole database contains 9129 323 sequences (about 10GB).
Proteins obtained from each original CDS were also saved in a
separate table in order to allow rapid accession of their speciﬁc
information like source organisms and biological functions of
encoded proteins.

3 DESIGN ALGORITHM

HiSpOD software allows oligonucleotide probe design for FGAs
in the context of microbial ecology but could also be adapted to
various biological models. It needs an input ﬁle in FASTA format
containing the target sequences. Two kinds of sequence are accepted
by the program: speciﬁc nucleic acid sequence and degenerate
nucleic acid sequence [consensus sequence resulting from multiple
alignments and based on IUB/IUPAC code (International Union of
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology/Intemational Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry)]. The program workﬂow consists in ﬁve
consecutive steps (Fig. 1):

(1) Oligonucleotide probe design. For each input sequence, the
probe length is deﬁned by the user. Along the sequence,
the algorithm extracts all probes by incrementing the
constant deﬁned probe size in a window. First, in the
case of degenerated sequences, all potential oligonucleotides
generated with a maximal degeneracy higher than the
threshold ﬁxed by the user are removed. Then, all
oligonucleotides or all combinations resulting from degenerate
probes are ﬁltered according to the melting temperature
(minimum and maximum Tm determined by the formula (A) in
which [Na+] is ﬁxed by default at 0.5 M) and the complexity
stretch (maximum authorized number of identical consecutive
bases).

(A)

(2) Similarity search. Oligonucleotides which successfully pass
the ﬁrst step are tested for similarity search against all the
sequences from EnvExBase database using BLASTN program
(Altschul et (11., 1990). The BLAST program is tuned for
this task as follows: the ‘DUST’ ﬁlter, used to mask low
complexity regions from nucleic acid sequences, is inactive
(—F F), the search strand is set to the positive one (—S 1), the
expected-value (—e) is a parameter Chosen by the user (1000
by default), the word size is set to the minimum length (—W 7)
and the number of reported results is ﬁxed to 500 (—b 500).

oligonucleotide are also mentioned. The second ﬁle ‘.result’
details the non-targeted sequences that may induce potential
cross-hybridizations with their accession numbers, source
organism and function of the encoded protein.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

HiSpOD is written in Perl 5 scripting language and uses a BioPerl
module for better visibility and to simplify the source code. A parallel
implementation allows probe ﬁnding to be done in parallel on
computing Cluster architecture. The parallelism is introduced in
Step (3) (cross-hybridization test) which is the most time-consuming
task of the process. For this step, HiSpOD integrates a distributed

and parallel implementation of the BLAST program (Darling et (11.,
2003) which uses the MPI library (Message Passing Interface) and
runs on parallel architectures.

HiSpOD software is installed on a symmetric multiprocessor
(SMP) machine with 8 AMD Opteron Dual-Core processors at 1.8
GHz, 128 GB RAM and running Linux CentOS 64 bits. For large
data storage, a SAN system disk with 2TB is used.

The application is freely accessible from a web interface
developed in PHP/MySql at http://fc.isima.fr/~g2im/hispod/. The
design results are made available on the server. HiSpOD is started
via the interface using the Chosen data entered by the user. The
computing is made on the symetric multiprocessor (SMP) machine
after a remote connection.

5 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

The efﬁciency of HiSpOD was then assessed by the design of
probes targeting genes encoding enzymes involved in the Chlorinated
solvent biodegradation.

5.1 Oligonucleotide probe set design

Probes were designed from 54 nucleic sequences corresponding
to 21 genes coding for enzymes involved in Chlorinated solvent
biodegradation pathways (15 involved in anaerobic pathways and
6 in aerobic ones), which were downloaded from the NCBI
database (Supplementary Table S1). Fourteen genes were treated,
starting with individual nucleotide sequences (amoB, todCI , todCZ,
bmoC, mmoC, xamoA, bch, prdA, rdhAI, rdhAZ, pceA from
Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195, pceA from Suﬂurospirillum
multivorans, pceA from Dehalobacter restrictus PER-K23 and pceA
from Shewanella sediminis HAW-EB3), 5 genes were treated at the
gene family level (pceA from Geobacter, rdhAIA, rdhAI B, rdhAZA

and rdhA2E) and 2 were treated at both the individual and the family
levels (tceA and vcrA). In order to target gene families, multiple
sequences were aligned by using ClustalW program (Thompson
et al., 1994) to determine degenerate consensus sequences before
probe design with HiSpOD. For each job launched on HiSpOD
program (23 entries), probes of 50mers in length were designed.
Table 1 summarizes the parameter values used for the probe
design.

Tm range was determined to obtain a probe set with a GC content
between 40 and 60%. Thus, ~5 days (121 h) were necessary for the
complete design with an average of 3.5 h for an individual sequence
and of 9.5 h for a degenerate sequence. Based on the speciﬁcity (no
or few cross-hybridizations) and the location of the probe along the
target sequence, multiple probes were then selected per gene (Table 2
and Supplementary Fig. S1).

In total, 295 oligonucleotide probes were designed. These were
used to elaborate a functional DNA microarray.

5.2 Experimental procedures

5.2.] Microarray building Microarrays were produced with
the NimbleGen high-density array synthesis technology (Roche
NimbleGen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Each oligonucleotide was
synthesized in situ in triplicate. Probes were randomly distributed
across the array in order to minimize spatial effect. In addition, the
microarray also reported 8863 random probes (20—56mers) used as
a metric of technical background noise and 11573 other control
probes (positive and negative) which allowed quality control of
oligonucleotide synthesis and hybridization conditions.

5.2.2 Synthetic antisense RNA target preparation and labelling
The complete mmoC (S81887), vcrA (AY322364) and tceA
(AF228507) gene sequences associated to SP6 promoter sequence at
their 3/ end were synthesized by Biomatik Corporation (Cambridge,
Ontario, Canada) and cloned into the pGH vector. Antisense
RNAs (aRNAs) were produced by in vitro transcription using the
MEGAscript SP6 Kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA) and then
labelled with Cy3-ULS as described in the Kreatech ULS labelling
procedure (Kreatech Diagnostics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
The aRNAs were quantiﬁed by spectrophotometry (at 260nm) as
well as dye incorporation (at 550nm) with a Nanodrop ND-1000
(NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, North Carolina, USA) and
RNA integrity was controlled with a Model 2100 Bioanalyzer
using the RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
California, USA).

5.2.3 Environmental target preparation and labelling Total
RNAs were extracted according a modiﬁed protocol (Vetriani
et al., 2003) from an industrial site contaminated with both
tetrachloroethene (PCE) and TCE) and biostimulated during
31 months before sample collection by SITA Remediation Company
(Lyon, France). In this protocol, freeze-thaw cycles were replaced
by beat betting 1 min at 30 Hz with 1 g of glass beads of 3106 11m
in diameter (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA). Co-
extracted DNA was removed by digestion with 4U of DNase I
(DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA) at 37°C for 35 min.
Using the MicrobExpress kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA), 8—
9 ug of total RNA mixture were subjected to mRNA enrichment
protocol. In a second step, antisense amino-allyl dUTP marked RNA
(aRNA) was obtained by ampliﬁcation with the MessageAmp II-
Bacteria kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA) and labelled with Cy3
ﬂuorescent dye (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was controlled with
a Model 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA).

5.2.4 Microarray hybridization A microarray was hybridized
with 1011 copies of each labelled Cy3-aRNA obtained from
synthetic genes and another one with 611g of Cy3-aRNA
obtained from the contaminated groundwater. Targets were dried
in a SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Villebon sur Yvette,
France) and resuspended in the NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer
(Roche NimbleGen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Then, targets
were hybridized on the microarray at 42°C for 72h using
a 4-bay NimbleGen Hybridization system (Roche NimbleGen,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Array washes were performed as

recommended by NimbleGen and slides were scanned at 211m
resolution using the InnoScan® 900 and Mapix® software
(Innopsys, Carbonne, France). Finally, pixel intensities were
extracted using NimbleScanTM v2.5 software (Roche NimbleGen,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and pair reports containing signal
intensity data for every spot on the array linked to its corresponding
probe identiﬁer were generated.

5.2.5 Data normalization and statistical analysis The
background noise was determined using random probes present
on the microarrays with the method described in Supplementary
Material 1 and was deﬁned by two parameters: the background
median intensity (Bposition) and its dispersion (Bdispersion). Finally,
a modiﬁed signal-to-noise ratio named SNR’ and based on the
formula SNR’ =(probe signal intensity —BPOSitiOH)/Bdispersion was
calculated in order to normalize our data. As suggested in the study
of He and Zhou (2008), positive hybridization was considered
signiﬁcant for probes having a SNR’ > 5.

5.2.6 Gene isolation from the contaminated groundwater
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from the industrial
contaminated site using a modiﬁed protocol originally described
by Vetriani et al. (2003). In this protocol, freeze-thaw cycles
were replaced by beat betting 1min at 30 Hz with 1g of glass
beads of 3106 11m in diameter (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis,
Missouri, USA). gDNA concentrations were measured using a
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, North Carolina, USA). PCR reactions were carried out
to isolate gene fragments for vcrA, bch, pceA and todCI (primer
list and PCR conditions in Supplementary Table S2). Amplicons
of correct size were then cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and sequenced by MWG
DNA sequencing services (Ebersberg, Germany).

5.2.7 Quantitative RT-PCR In order to validate the semi-
quantitative aspect of microarray results, qRT-PCR assays were
performed. RT reactions were carried out in duplicate from 100 ng
of total RNA extracted from the contaminated environment using
vcrA, bch and pceA (0.625 11M of each primer) reverse primer
mix (Supplementary Table S2). Control for DNA contamination
evaluation was the same reaction without reverse transcriptase.
Then, quantitative reactions were performed for each gene
independently. For each of the two RT replicates, the quantitative
reaction was achieved twice, thus leading to four measurements for
each gene. For the gDNA contamination control, the quantitative
reaction was completed four times. Finally, three replicates for
each point of the stande curve (serially diluted cDNA) were
measured. The reaction was performed in a ﬁnal volume of 20 111
containing 5 ul of cDNA, 10 ul of 2X MESA Green qPCR for SYBR
assay mixture (Eurogentec, Liege, Belgium) and the corresponding
primer sets described in Supplementary Material (Supplementary
Table S3) at 0.2 uM ﬁnal concentration each. qPCR was realized in
the Mastercycler Realplex (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) starting
with 5 min of denaturation at 95°C followed by 40 cycles consisting
of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 59°C for 15 s and
elongation at 68°C for 30s. Data analysis was achieved with
realplex software version 1.5 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The
quantiﬁcation of transcripts in the RNA sample was determined

after subtraction of the gene copy number obtained for the gDNA

5.2.8 Accession numbers Nucleotide sequences without PCR
primer sequences were deposited in the GenBank database
under accession numbers HM140426 and HM140427 for
vcrA, HM140428 and HM140429 for bch and HM140430
and HM140431 for pceA. The microarray data discussed
in this publication are available at the GEO web site
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number:
GSE21492.

5.3 Probe efﬁciency analysis

5.3.1 Probe sensitivity and speciﬁcity A ﬁrst experiment was
performed to test the ability of probes to reliably identify genes
involved in chlorinated solvent degradation. Thus, three synthetic
genes [mmoC (S81887), vcrA (AY322364) and tceA (AF228507)]
were used to produce aRNA by in vitro transcription. Then,
1011 copies of each labelled aRNA were hybridized to the array.
Whatever the gene tested, the results (GSE21492) showed that all
corresponding probes gave a strong positive hybridization signal
(Table 3), which is in agreement with a great sensitivity of probes
designed with HiSpOD. These probes are also highly speciﬁc
because no hybridization signals (SNR’ >5) were obtained with
probes targeting the other genes (21 genes are targeted by the
microarray).

5.3.2 Industrial polluted site analysis Microarray hybridization
with labelled antisense mRNA extracted from a PCE/T CE
contaminated groundwater, allowed a full identiﬁcation of expressed
genes on the environmental sample. Four genes were detected
(average intensity of all speciﬁc probes with SNR’ > 5): three
encoded reductive dehalogenases involved in the anaerobic
dehalorespiration pathway (vcrA and bch from Dehalococcoides
and pceA from Sulfurospirillum) and one implicated in the aerobic
TCE biodegradation pathway (todCI from Pseudomonas). Positive
hybridization signals were obtained for all regions of the three genes
involved in the anaerobic dehalorespiration pathway. In contrast,
only one out of the two targeted regions for todCI was detected. This
ﬁnding suggested that hybridization of the probes designed to target
the 3’ extremity of todCI gene resulted from cross-hybridization
and did not reﬂect the presence of transcripts on the contaminated
site. In addition, PCR and sequencing experiments allowed the
isolation of gene fragments for vcrA (HM140426 and HM140427),
bch (HM140428 and HM140429) and pceA (HM140430 and
HM140431) but not for todCI , conﬁrming the results obtained with
the DNA microarray.

(average SNR’ :73 and 8.2, respectively), which could suggest
a higher abundance of vcrA transcripts in the sample (Fig. 2A).
To conﬁrm these results, transcript quantiﬁcation by qRT—PCR was
performed on the same groundwater sample and the measurement
of the expression level showed a higher number of transcripts for
vcrA (7415 :I: 949 copies/ng of RNA) than for both bch and pceA
(1072 :I: 86 and 559 :I: 87 copies/ng of RNA, respectively) in the RNA
sample (Fig. 2B).

These data support the applicability of our FGA for gene
identiﬁcation and as a semi-quantitative tool for gene expression
evaluation with the advantage to survey numerous genes at the same
time.

6 DISCUSSION

HiSpOD takes into account a greater number of criteria to select
more efﬁcient probes (Table 4) compared with most popular
softwares used for oligonucleotide probe design for FGAs (Li et al.,
2005; Nordberg, 2005; Wernersson and Nielsen, 2005), The entire
software suite is available through web services. To produce the
DNA probes, users can enter their sequences of interest and set the
required parameters.

Furthermore, our software can be applied to both, individual
nucleotide gene sequences and degenerated consensus sequences,
produced by multiple alignments of gene sequences belonging to
a same gene family. Therefore, the user has the possibility to
identify speciﬁc probes either at the gene or at the gene family
level. For this last case, design methods previously reported are
based on sequence clustering (Chung et al., 2005; Feng and Tillier,
2007) or on the use of mismatch probes (Jaing et al., 2008), which
constrain the selection of probes in the most conserved regions.
In contrast, HiSpOD allows considering regions generating the
least number of cross-hybridizations even if they are more variable
within the gene family. Because all sequence combinations for each
degenerate probe are re-created for the DNA microarray synthesis,
some of them could detect new gene sequences not yet available
in international databases. Furthermore, as the number of probes
per array is no longer a constraint, given the development of

very high density microarrays (several million probes proposed by
NimbleGen), designing microarray to encompass the full diversity
of sequence variants encountered in the environment or in speciﬁc
metabolic process is now feasible. By this aspect, the HiSpOD
method is then a pioneer explorative approach to the design of
probes dedicated to FGAs. Today, the only probe design software
described to allow an exploratory study of environmental samples
using degenerate probes is PhylArray (Militon et al., 2007),
but it is dedicated to phylogenetic oligonucleotide microarrays
(POAs).

Cross-hybridizations with non-target sequences can be a
signiﬁcant contribution to the hybridization signal, potentially
introducing substantial error. According to He et al. (2007), they
represent one of the most critical limits of DNA microarray approach
when dealing with complex environmental samples of unknown
composition. However, over the past two decades, new sequencing
technology developments and the trend of declining sequencing
costs, allowed an exponential growth of public DNA sequence
data. Data analysis has revealed an extraordinary gene diversity
and a huge nucleic sequence polymorphism for all investigated
environmental microbial habitats especially by metagenomics
approach (Kottmann et al., 2010). This extraordinary resource
can now be mined for DNA microarrays applications to assess
the potential cross-hybridizations. Currently, HiSpOD is the most
suitable tool to take into account this wide diversity to limit cross-
hybridations with a test of speciﬁcity conducted against EnvExBase,
a large and representative database of all prokaryotic, fungal
and environmental sequences. This database includes all known
potential CDSs and their putative UTRs. However, as the HiSpOD
algorithm extracts all probes by incrementing the constant deﬁned
probe size in a window along the sequence, the time required
for evaluating their speciﬁcity can be quite long (several hours
per gene) especially for highly degenerate oligonucleotide probes.
So, HiSpOD is greatly dependent on the performance of MP1-
BLAST program used in the speciﬁcity test step. Currently, we
are focusing our efforts to increase the program performance by
deploying it on a larger cluster infrastructure and on a computing
grid. Given the exponential increase in the number of sequences
in databases, the DNA microarrays will be upgraded regularly with
novel probes allowing the targeting of either new variants of the
targeted genes or genes newly discovered. In addition, EnvExBase
component of the HiSpOD software will be updated regularly. An

improvement of the database structure, consisting in a split into
multiple sub-databases according to particular ecosystems (soil,
marine, freshwater, atmosphere, etc.), is also under development.
It will provide an enhanced usability of the program, with a
faster speed and an elimination of unneeded cross-hybridization
information. Currently, no known software offers the opportunity
to test for speciﬁcity on such a large database. Furthermore, no
tested software (i.e. OligoWiz, CommOligo and Yoda) is able to
integrate this database to perform the speciﬁcity test with it. This
is probably due to an inadequate performance optimization of
these algorithms which systematically crashed when using a large
database. In addition, the clustering of cross-hybridization sequences
using BLASTClust tool is another original approach proposed by
our software to deﬁne gene sequence families that may induce
potential cross-hybridizations and so to facilitate selection of the
most appropriate probes.

Probe sensitivity is another crucial parameter, particularly for
environmental studies, where biomass can be low. So, design
process allowing the selection of oligonucleotide probes need to
be optimized. Generally, microarray-based hybridization presents
a low detection limit. For example, 50mer probe FGA detection
limit was estimated to be in the range of 5—10ng of gDNA in the
absence of background DNA and was about 10-fold lower in its
presence (Rhee et al., 2004). In this last case, target sequences
were extrapolated to represent genomic material from <5% of
the total community of an environment (Gentry et al., 2006). For
mRNA, no detection limit is currently assessed in environmental
sample. It remains hard to solve the sensitivity issue despite the
existence of some protocols bringing those limits down (Gao
et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2006). In this study, we demonstrated the
ability of probes designed with HiSpOD to detect mRNA retrieved
from environmental samples with a high sensitivity (e.g. 559:I:87
copies/ng of RNA for pceA) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, expression
proﬁles obtained were comparable with those of qRT—PCR assays
suggesting the semi-quantitative aspect of the microarray elaborated
using this software. We demonstrate that the microarray developed
in this study provides a powerful tool to monitor chlorinated
ethene biodegradation capabilities in complex environments. This
tool will be now used for a wider study incorporating several
industrial polluted sites where a more or less complete degradation
of chlorinated solvents was observed.

However, certain limitations still remain. Indeed, numerous
authors have highlighted the problem of signal variability obtained
with probes targeting different regions of the same gene (Bruun
et al., 2007; Held et al., 2006), certainly when linked with probe
thermodynamic properties and/or target secondary structure. The
function of these parameters is still difﬁcult to evaluate and to
visualize in the microarray results. Although their calculation is time

consuming, they will be taken into account in the next version of
HiSpOD.

In this study, the new software was shown to be particularly
accurate to design probes dedicated to microbial ecology. The
experimental validation of the oligonucleotide probe set designated
using HiSpOD was performed with mRNA extracted from a
PCE/T CE contaminated aquifer where pollutant biodegradation was
observed (Site description and chemical analysis in Supplementary
Material 2 and Table S4). These pollutants undergo biodegradation
through two different pathways: (i) use as an electron acceptor
(reductive dechlorination) (Futagami et al., 2008) and (ii) co-
metabolism where degradation of the chlorinated solvent is simply
fortuitous and provides no beneﬁt to the microorganism (Arp et al.,
2001), the ﬁrst being the major process for the natural biodegradation
of chlorinated solvents. In this study, the most recognized gene
sequences involved in these two metabolic processes where
extracted from international databases and were used for probe
design. The microarray presented here is, to our knowledge the
most complete high-throughput molecular tool describing these
pathways with 295 probes covering 54 sequence variants of 21
genes and in addition with an explorative side. By comparison,
GeoChip mentioned 35 probes targeting genes characteristics of
PCE/T CE biodegradation pathways (He et al., 2007). In the context
of industrial site rehabilitation, it could be also applied as a
diagnostic tool to detect microbial activities before, during and
after bioremediation treatment. Moreover, this explorative high-
throughput tool could be used to monitor the distribution of these
catabolic pathways along non-contaminated ecosystems in order to
better understand the origin of these fascinating microbial functions.

7 CONCLUSION

In summary, we present a novel probe design software called
HiSpOD dedicated to FGA developments. HiSpOD allows probe
design at both speciﬁc gene and gene family levels through
an original approach based on degenerated probe determination.
Moreover, speciﬁcity test was conducted against a large formatted
database composed of all known CDS retrieved from the taxonomic
divisions PRO, FUN and ENV of the EMBL databank in order
to avoid cross-hybridization events. Finally, the user-friendly web
interface developed simpliﬁes greatly the user access to the program.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genomic copy number variation (CNV) can influence sus-
ceptibility to common diseases. High-throughput measurement of
gene copy number on large numbers of samples is a challenging,
yet critical, stage in confirming observations from sequencing or
array Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH). The paralogue ratio
test (PRT) is a simple, cost-effective method of accurately determining
copy number by quantifying the amplification ratio between a target
and reference amplicon. PRT has been successfully applied to several
studies analyzing common CNV. However, its use has not been wide-
spread because of difficulties in assay design.

Results: We present PRTPrimer (www.prtprimer.org) software for
automated PRT assay design. In addition to stand-alone software,
the web site includes a database of pre-designed assays for the
human genome at an average spacing of 6kb and a web interface
for custom assay design. Other reference genomes can also be ana-
lyzed through local installation of the software. The usefulness of
PRTPrimer was tested within known CNV, and showed reproducible
quantification. This software and database provide assays that can
rapidly genotype CNV, cost-effectively, on a large number of samples
and will enable the widespread adoption of PRT.

Availability: PRTPrimer is available in two forms: a Perl script (version
5.14 and higher) that can be run from the command line on Linux sys-
tems and as a service on the PRTPrimer web site (www.prtprimer.org).

1 INTRODUCTION

Copy number variation (CNV) is a pervasive and extensive
source of variation between individual genomes in humans and
many other species. A genome-wide picture of CNV has been
provided in humans by large consortia, typically using array-
comparative genomic hybridization (Conrad et al., 2010; Itsara
et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2010). For example, a key analysis used
an oligonucleotide tiling array to assay common CNV of >1 kb
and found that two diploid human genomes typically differed
in >1000 CNVs, covering a length of 24Mb (0.8% of the

genome). For the 41 individuals studied from two populations
taken together, 3.7% of the genome was shown to be copy
number variable (Conrad et al., 2010). In another study, Itsara
et a]. studied large, rare CNV and showed that 6&80% of indi-
viduals have a CNV of >100 kb (Itsara et al., 2009). Pang et a].
constructed a comprehensive map of CNV in a single genome
and estimated structural variation to cover 48.8 Mb, a region
including 4867 genes (Pang et al., 2010).

There is considerable evidence for CNV affecting phenotype,
much of which comes from disease studies in humans.
Association analysis of common CNV with phenotypes is lim-
ited, in part, by the inherent noise in typing complex CNV with
aCGH technology or quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).
Nevertheless, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
(WT CCC) analyzed the genome-wide association between
common CNV (56% had minor allele frequency >5%) and re-
ported ﬁve robust associations with complex diseases (Even
though they included only 4250% of CNV with a minor allele
frequency >5%) (The Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium, 2010). Other well-founded associations include the
effect of high B—defensin copy number on psoriasis (Hollox et al.,
2008; Stuart et al., 2012), the effect of C YP2D6 copy number on
drug metabolism (Zhou et al., 2009) and the role of oc-globin
copy number in oc-thalassemia and protection against severe mal-
aria (May et al., 2007). Rare CNVs have also been shown to have
major effects in human disease, particularly in neurological dis-
orders such as schizophrenia and autism (Lee et al., 2011;
Morrow, 2010), although methodological issues have compli-
cated interpretation. In Drosophila melanogaster, the C yp6g1
gene copy number is associated with resistance to the insecticide
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (Schmidt et al., 2010), and amp-
lification of the pfmdr] gene confers meﬂoquine resistance in
Plasmodium falciparum (Cowman et al., 1994). In dogs, the dip-
loid copy number of AM Y2B ranges between 4 and 30, and may
be involved in the adaption to a starch-rich diet in early domes-
tication (Axelsson et al., 2013). These both provide compelling
evidence for a functional effect of CNV in other species.

To maximize the power of association studies of CNV and
phenotype, it is necessary to characterize CNV in terms of the
actual integer number of copies per diploid genome (l, 2, 3, 4
etc.) in a cost-effective manner on large numbers of DNA samples.
Genome-wide genotyping of CNV is possible by aCGH, sequence
read depth analysis of next-generation sequencing and analysis of
hybridization signal intensity from SNP genotyping arrays

(Sudmant et al., 2010). These methods can detect CNV, but are
limited in their ability to accurately call integer copy number of
complex multiallelic CNVs. A comprehensive comparison of
array platforms and CNV detection software showed <50% con-
cordance between approaches and reproducibility of replicate ex-
periments at <70% (Pinto et al., 2011). For example, current
sequence read depth analysis methods have high false discovery
rates (<1(%89%), relatively low detection rates (3&60%) and are
crucially dependent on the quality of read alignment to the refer-
ence genome (Abyzov et al., 2011; Mills et al., 2011; Teo et al.,
2012). In addition, micrograms of DNA are often required by
these methods, with whole genome ampliﬁcation not being
Viable, as current methods are known to introduce inconsistent
copy number bias (Pugh et al., 2008).

There are three commonly used locus-speciﬁc methods that
attempt to meet the challenge of accurate and efﬁcient genotyp-
ing of CNV in large numbers of samples: multiplex ligation-de-
pendent ampliﬁcation, qPCR and the paralogue ratio test (PRT).
The multiplex ligation-dependent ampliﬁcation method is used
routinely in clinical genetics for screening disease genes for exons,
and has been shown to accurately infer integer copy number even
on challenging multicopy loci (Eijk-Van Os and Schouten, 2011).
However, it is propriety, expensive and commercially available
only for certain loci, and often 10(L200 ng of DNA is required.
qPCR is frequently used as a high-throughput method for CNV
typing, particularly using ﬂuorescent-quencher systems such as
TaqMan. However, the method is susceptible to variation in
DNA quality and often gives apparently precise, but inaccurate,
results at multicopy loci. This has been a bane of human CNV
studies, leading to controversy in the field (Cantsilieris and
White, 2013; Perne et al., 2009).

PRT is a form of quantitative PCR that differs from the con-
ventional method in one important aspect: by careful design of
the primers targeting paralogous sequences, one primer pair is
used to amplify a putative CNV target locus relative to a single
copy reference locus (Armour et al., 2007). This makes the kin-
etics of target and reference ampliﬁcation similar, and results in
increased accuracy of integer copy number calling. The target
and reference amplicons can be separated by size using electro-
phoresis or by sequence using pyrosequencing, restriction
enzyme digest or real-time PCR with sequence-speciﬁc ﬂuores-
cent reporter probes. PRT assays have been successfully applied
in a number of human CNV studies (Aldhous et al., 2010;
Carpenter et al., 2011; Fode et al., 2011a, b; Hollox et al.,
2009; Morris et al., 2010; Saldanha et al., 2011). Currently,
PRT assay design involves a laborious process of selecting
either a self-chain segment (a short sequence that matches to
more than one place in the genome, but is not a known repeat
element) or a low copy number repeat within the target sequence.
The selected sequence is then mapped to the reference genome
using BLAT (Kent, 2002), and the sequence alignment of the
target and paralogue(s) examined to identify two identically
matched sequences long enough to allow primer design and
ﬂanking a stretch of DNA either of different length or sequence.
Last, the putative primers are assessed using in silico PCR, to
check that they produce only two amplicons of the predicted size,
failing which the process will need to be repeated.

This current design approach requires several hours for each
assay and is dependent on self-chain or a low copy number

repeat sequence in the target interval, which limits the number
of assays that can be designed. In addition, there is some prob-
ability that an assay will not successfully transfer into the labora-
tory. These problems have prevented the widespread adoption of
PRT, despite its beneﬁts over other technologies, but could be
overcome by an automated approach to assay design.

With this in mind, we have developed the software PRTPrimer
and the web resource www.prtprimer.org. PRTPrimer is aimed
at all users who would beneﬁt from designing PRT assays for the
human genome. The software can be installed locally or run
through the web resource, is optimized for multicore systems
and can be adapted to use genomes from other species.

2 SOFTWARE

2.1 Features

We have devised an automated approach to PRT design that uses
brute-force computation based on the following steps (Fig. 1).

(1) Design a large number of primer pairs in the target
interval.

(2) Determine the location of potential ampliﬁcation sites of
these primer pairs in the reference human genome.

(3) Isolate those that are perfect priming matches for only two
amplicons in the reference genome.

(4) Apply ﬁltering to identify optimal PRT assays for the
target region.

PRTPrimers are available in two forms: a Perl script (version
5.14 and higher) that can be run from the command line on
Linux systems and as a service on the PRTPrimer web site
(www.prtprimer.org). The software takes genomic coordinates
(GRCh37) or sequence in FASTA format (command line
only), and outputs a ﬁle of potential PRT assays.

2.2 Input options

PRT assay accuracy is dependent on the equally efﬁcient ampli-
fication of the target and reference amplicons. Later in the art-
icle, we describe parameters that allow these amplicons to be
designed in most genomic regions. A summary of all parameters
is available in Supplementary Table S1.

2.3 Masking
By default PRTPrimer uses a set of sequence masking options:

(i) SNP masking (dbSNP build 135). This reduces potential
ampliﬁcation differences between individuals due to allelic
differences affecting primer annealing.

(ii) Alu masking [RepeatMasker (www.repeatmasker.org)].
Primers for PRT assays that are within Alu elements are
more difﬁcult to optimize for copy number calling because
of the high copy number of Alu elements.

(iii) Simple tandem repeat masking [Tandem Repeat Finder
(Benson, 1999)]. Primers within simple tandem repeats
(STRs) have the potential to misalign within the repeat
or anneal to similar STRs elsewhere in the genome.

Fig. 1. Overview of PRTPrimer. Target region for which PRTs are
required on chromosome 3 is shown in black. The software ﬁrst
splits the region into overlapping segments to ensure an even distribu-
tion of PRTs. A large number of amplicons are designed for each of
these segments irrespective of what type of sequence they are in, i.e.
segmental duplication, SINE and so forth. Each amplicon is then
aligned to the human genome allowing for mismatches with the pri-
mers. Only amplicons that have exact priming matches twice in the
genome are selected for ﬁltering. The final stage ﬁlters the results to
only those amplicons that meet adjustable criteria, such as size differ-
ence between target and reference, no SNPs at primer positions and
CNVs spanning the reference amplicon. In this example, the target
amplicon is 100 bp and the reference amplicon on a different chromo-
some is 120 bp

Each of these masking options can be toggled for regions
where PRTs are not being designed under default masking.

2.4 Primer design

For any particular genomic region, primer pairs are more
likely to amplify a single amplicon from a unique region or
amplify many amplicons from a multicopy region, rather than
amplify two products from separate regions. It is the latter
condition that is required for a PRT, and to increase the
chance that suitable PRTs will be identiﬁed, the algorithm
generates many primer pairs (e.g. 2000 per kb) within the
target interval. The number of amplicons designed for the
interval is controlled by the parameter ppn, which determines
the average number of primer pairs to be designed per nu-
cleotide (default 2). The algorithm also limits the amplicon
size range (default 10(L300 bp) and sets optimal/min/max
primer lengths. We used the popular and reliable Primer3
program (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000) to design the primer
pairs. Primer3 is provided as a complete package as
OpenSource from http://primer3.sourceforge.net/. The initial
Primer3 amplicon design is as close to the optimum param-
eters as possible, for each subsequent design the optimum
parameters are relaxed in decrements until the set number
of primer pairs has been reached. This concentration of

primers within sequences close to the optimal parameters
can cause a poor distribution of amplicons across the target
interval. To ensure a more even distribution, PRTPrimer splits
the input sequence into overlapping segments in which
Primer3 is separately run (default is 2kb, offset by 300bp).
Additional Primer3 parameters can be edited directly in the
Perl script.

2.5 Alignment to reference genome

The algorithm generates a large number of primer pairs, depend-
ent on the size of the target region and the value of ppn. To
ensure an efﬁcient alignment algorithm, we selected isPCR,
which uses the BLAT algorithm to create an index of llmers
from the genome to increase alignment speed (Kent, 2002).
isPCR can be obtained free from http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/
~kent/ for academic, non-proﬁt and personal use. This aligns
each primer to the reference genome and determines whether a
product under a speciﬁed length could be ampliﬁed. Using de-
fault parameters (tileSize=11, stepSize=5, minPerfect=15),
isPCR identiﬁes all exact matches in the reference genome and
a proportion of products derived from mispriming sites, i.e. nu-
cleotide mismatches between primer and reference genome.
An optional ‘sensitive’ setting (tileSize: 10, stepSize=1,
minPerfect=5) detects a greater proportion of potential mis-
priming sites; however, this can take a substantially longer
time, up to 10-fold, to process depending on the size and
sequence composition of the primers.

2.6 Filtering

The data generated by the alignment stage can be substantial, as
the data include all primer pair perfect matches, which could be
from 1 to many 1000s, as well as the amplicon locations from
potential mispriming. The software ﬁlters these data to include
only those primers that produce two amplicons with exact primer
matches. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and described further in
‘implementation and performance’. PRT products can be sepa-
rated and quantiﬁed by different technologies, and as such a
number of ﬁltering options are available to the user to select
those most appropriate for their technology of choice.

(1) Minimum/maximum size difference between the target and
reference amplicon. The simplest way to distinguish the
PRT amplicons is through a size difference. A size differ-
ence of zero can be selected if the user wishes to search for
RFLPs or qPCR probes within the products; a size differ-
ence of >2 is recommended for detection by capillary elec-
trophoresis; and a size difference of ~10% of the
maximum amplicon size is recommend for detection by
agarose gel electrophoresis.

(2) Minimum/maximum product size of reference amplicon
(also applies to target amplicon, but only if these values
are within the limits set for Primer3). Very small or very
large amplicons may be undesirable with some technolo-
gies, but can be useful if there is limited PRT choice.

(3) Minimum distance between target and reference (default
500kb). This prevents the references being within the
boundaries of the target CNV.

2.7 Output

Each final potential PRT is displayed on two lines, one for
the target and one for the reference (example at the bottom of
Fig. 2). In each case, the amplicon genomic coordinates and size
are followed by additional information to aid PRT selection:

(1) Number of detected potential misprimed amplicons with
an isPCR score >900 (representing ~4 mismatches be-
tween primers and hybridization site). A low number for
this count indicates that there would be a high probability
of only two amplicons being produced, with only a small
probability of incorrect products being amplified.

(2) Indication whether amplicons lay within an annotated
CNV or indel [annotation according to the database of
genomic variants (DGV)]. This might be expected for
target, but should be avoided for reference, with the
caveat that exact boundaries and validity of many of
the CNVs in DGV are open to question.

(3) Indication of SNPs in primers at target and reference
(dbSNP build 135). This will only apply for reference if
the target was designed with SNP masking. This checks
against all SNPs in dbSNP, including rare and unvalidated
variants.

2.8 Special modiﬁcations

2.8.] Multitarget CN V For some copy number variants, the
target sequence is present in the reference genome more than
once per haploid genome. The standard method of searching
for two amplicons in the reference genome does not take this
into account. A modiﬁcation has been applied to the program
that allows up to four speciﬁed targets in the reference genome.
The software will check that the PRT ampliﬁes within all these
targets plus a reference with a different size to the amplicons in
the targets.

2.8.2 Other species The Perl script can be easily modiﬁed for
other organisms, and has been tested with rhesus macaque and
mouse genomes.

2.9 Web site

The PRTPrimer.org web site has been designed to allow users to
take advantage of PRTPrimer without the need for local instal-
lation. There is also searchable database of a genome-wide set of
pre-designed PRTs.

2.10 Genome-wide pre-design database

We have performed a genome-wide search for PRTs (hg19,
masked for SNPs, STRs and Alu elements) using 50 Mb seg-
ments of the genome, each further split into 2 kb fragments over-
lapping by 300bp, to give an average of one primer pair per
nucleotide. Each PRT was further assessed using the sensitive
settings of isPCR to ﬁnd all potential mispriming sites and
checked for amplicon generation from a single primer. This data-
base can be searched by location, size difference and maximum
potential misprimed amplicons. The output, example in
Supplementary Figure S1, can be sorted by each column and

Fig. 2. The output of the alignment procedure is stored in a text ﬁle [BED
format (genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html)] with the PRT ID,
genomic location and alignment score. Because of the potential size of
these ﬁles, SQLite databases are used to aid efﬁcient access to these ﬁles
without prohibitive memory requirements. The original output from
Primer3 is stored in a single database and the BED ﬁles are processed
to store a maximum of the ﬁrst ﬁve exact genomic matches for each
amplicon. In addition, each amplicon is counted for the total number
of exact matches, and matches with an alignment score >900 (indicating
up to four mismatches). The characteristics of amplicons that match just
twice in the genome and their corresponding Primer3 data can be rapidly
extracted from these databases. The results can then be ﬁltered for vari-
ous output settings and checked for existing CNV, indels and SNPs. The
ﬁnal output can be seen at the bottom for a single PRT: ID 2 unique ID
for PRT; Chr, Start, End: genomic location; Size=amplicon length in

ampliﬁed with small number of mismatches in primers; DGV=detects
whether the amplicon coincides with any reported CNV or indels;
Forward, Reversezamplicon primers; SizeDiff = length difference be-
tween target and reference amplicons; FSNP, RSNP: number of SNPs
within primers

can be output in a variety of formats. There are also hyperlinks
to locate the position of target and reference for a PRT on the
UCSC genome browser. The returned PRTs can be displayed as
a custom track on the UCSC genome browser (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

2.11 Live design

If there are no suitable pre-designed PRTs in a target region, the
user can perform a custom PRT search on the web site. Jobs are
queued on a ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-served basis and results are emailed
to the user along with a link to a custom track on the UCSC
genome browser.

Fig. 3. A diagram from the UCSC Genome Browser of PRT assays designed for the SODZ gene region under two different runs of PRTPrimer using
different parameters aligned against RepeatMasker and self-chain output for the interval. For Track A, primers were allowed to be designed in SINES
and other genome regions. For Track B, SINES were excluded from the designed process. Track B resulted in PRT assays that are more likely to succeed

in the laboratory, whereas Track A has a higher density of coverage

RAM. Package and installation instructions are available at
www.PRTPrimer.org. The online version has been tested on all
modern browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer
and Firefox.

A major consideration for PRTPrimer was speed, as the
searching of large numbers of primers against the genome is
computationally intensive. We optimized the script to take ad-
vantage of modern multicore processors by running the isPCR in
eight threads in parallel; however, this resulted in increasing the
memory requirement to 12GB of RAM. The script can be
adapted to run on systems with higher or lower numbers of
processing cores with corresponding increases or decreases in
memory usage. SQLite was implemented to handle the large
arrays of primer data that could not be held in memory. As
PRTPrimer is written in Perl, it is relatively simple for any user
to edit the program for different RAM/CPU systems or to add
additional species.

3.2 Parameter reﬁnement

To optimize parameter defaults we have experimented with dif-
ferent design parameters: potential to misprime due to tolerance
of mismatched nucleotides in the primers, masking of high copy
number sequences [e.g. Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs)]
and primer density. Experiments were conducted on the
human genome (GRCh37/hg19), using two targets on chromo-
somal regions 6p25 and 21q21. Figure 3 shows the results from
PRTPrimer under two different settings for a region around the
SODZ gene (Chr6) that had previously been unsuccessful for
manual design. Track A assays are mostly within SINEs and
LINEs, whereas Track B assays are in LINEs, LTRs and
human self-chain segments. Track A shows results for 200
assays in 21 clusters, and Track B shows 1823 assays in 15 clus-
ters. To examine the reliability of PRT assays we ampliﬁed eight
PRT assays, group A, that had a high potential for mispriming
(>3 products generated from <4 nucleotide mismatches in the
primers) and nine PRT assays (seven from Track A and two
from Track B), group B, that had a low potential for mispriming
(<3 products generated from <4 nucleotide mismatches in the
primers). Of the group B assays, four showed two clean PCR
products and consistent copy number calls, whereas all group A

assays failed to produce clean PCR products. This suggested that
assays designed in SINEs have a low success rate in the labora-
tory because of the high number of mispriming matches in the
genome. Approximately 25% of Track A assays and 39% of
Track B assays had a low potential for mispriming, indicating
that the likely conversion rate for PRTs generated on masked
sequence will be higher than unmasked sequence. An example
PRT generated by PRTPrimer can be seen in Supplementary
Figure S3. Further investigations were carried out on samples
with trisomy 21 for PRTs generated on chromosome 21. Of the
six PRTs designed within Alu repeats, only one successfully
called the correct copy number, whereas seven PRTs of fourteen
designed within LTR and L1 elements produced clean products
and successfully called copy number of chromosome 21 (An ex-
ample can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S4). Overall, assays
designed in LINEs, self-chain segments or other sequences dif-
fered minimally in success rate, with the main determinant being
the potential number of amplicons generated through misprim-
ing due to tolerance of nucleotide mismatches. Therefore, it is
not recommended to design PRTs in SINES, although these
could potentially be used with careful optimization, e.g. high
annealing temperature, hot-start polymerase, short extension
time and reduced cycle number.

3.3 Assay design across the human genome

Potential PRTs were designed across the human genome by par-
titioning chromosomes into 50 Mb intervals and running
PRTPrimer on the University of Leicester high performance
computing cluster. The parameters were set to design 2000
primer pairs per 2kb

window (1 primer pair per nucleotide), a total of around 3
billion primer pairs. The total number of assays successfully de-
signed was 65 604294 (2.2% of primer pairs). Dividing the
genome in 10 kb windows, 67% of windows with a GC content
of between 30 and 50% contained a PRT, whereas 30% of win-

chromosomes 13 and 19, which are gene-poor and gene-rich,
respectively. Table 1 shows number of assays according to se-
quence or size difference between the target and reference ampli-
cons, and whether the reference amplicon is >500 kb from the
target (to aid in selecting references that are not in the same
CNV).

On chromosome 19 (55 994 806 bp excluding the centromere),
there are 1729709 potential PRTs with a sequence difference
between the amplicons, which fall into 11 335 contiguous clusters
(average density one cluster per 4.9 kb). The mean gap between
clusters is 4.7kb, with a median of 0.8 kb. Apart from at the
centromere, there are 32 gaps of over 100kb (maximum gap
261 kb). Overall in any 50 kb window, there is an 84.5%
chance of there being at least one cluster of PRT assays. Of
the 1949 Ensembl genes (including RNA genes, pseudogenes
etc) on chromosome 19, a total of 50.7% have at least one
PRT assay within them, 81.2% have an assay within 10kb,
and 98.0% of genes have an assay within 50 kb. Conrad et al.
found 71 CNV on chromosome 19, which were >10kb, and of
these 64 are tagged with a pre-designed PRT assay from this
study (Conrad et al., 2010).

On chromosome 13 (113 249 859 bp), there are 2060 532 assays
in 18308 clusters (average density one cluster per 6.2 kb). The
mean gap between clusters is 4.7 kb, with six gaps >100 kb (max-
imum 177 kb). In any 50 kb window, there is a 98.7% chance of
there being at least one cluster of PRT assays. Of the 1177
Ensembl genes on chromosome 13, a total of 54.5% have at
least one PRT assay within them, 92.5% have an assay within
10 kb, and 100% of them have an assay within 50 kb. Of the 41
CNV >10 kb on chromosome 13 identiﬁed by Conrad et al., 40
are tagged with a PRT assay from this study (Conrad et al.,
2010).

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we describe a resource of off-the-shelf PRT assays
as well as for custom design of assays. This resource, and PRTs
in general, is conceived as an accessible method of validating and
replicating CNV data generated by high-throughput approaches,
such as array CGH, SNP genotyping arrays or genome-scale
sequencing. PRT allows the accurate typing of copy number at

individual genomic loci in hundreds of DNA samples at a low
cost. The simplest form of PRT assays can be typed using PCR
with unlabeled oligonucleotides and agarose gels, at a cost af-
fordable by any laboratory. To increase throughput or reduce
labor power, PRT assays can be multiplexed using capillary elec-
trophoresis or by qPCR.

Previously the utility of the PRT had been limited by the dif-
ficulty of assay design. This has meant in practice that PRT has
been used by a limited number of laboratories with experience of
the design issues. PRTPrimer overcomes this limitation by allow-
ing users to either use the pre-designed assays, or if no suitable
ones are found, to run the software to generate custom assays.
This facility should open up the use of PRT to a diverse range of
laboratories that want type CNV in patient collections. The typ-
ical scenario we envisage is where array or sequencing data have
identiﬁed a particular CNV as being possibly associated with a
phenotype, and researchers want to type their own patient cohort
for the same CNV without resorting to whole-genome analysis,
whether because of affordability issues or lack of sufﬁcient
DNA. Large genomic laboratories may want to use PRT as an
easy method of replicating high-throughput data by an alterna-
tive method with accurate quantiﬁcation of copy number.

The software implementation of PRTPrimer involves a pipe-
line with genomic data passing through two well-established and
publically available packages, Primer3 and isPCR, followed by
data sorting, filtering and output. The approach relies on brute-
force computation to design a high number of potential PCR
products in a genomic region, align all of the primer pairs to the
genome, using BLAT, to identify those that amplify exactly two
products and then filter for those that have the desirable char-
acteristics of a PRT assay. This approach contrasts with the
current method of using genome annotation to guide assay
design, allowing a far greater number of assays to be designed
over a wider proportion of the genome.

Assays in the pre-designed database are not randomly distrib-
uted but fall into clusters of overlapping amplicons. Many of the
amplicons within a cluster will vary by just a few base pairs at
each end, and therefore do not represent truly different assays.
However, other clusters will represent multiple assays that over-
lap. On a higher level the distribution of the clusters is also not
random, with occasional gaps of >100kb, although the mean
gap is <5 kb. Of CNVs >10kb, a high proportion is tagged by
PRT assays in the database; smaller CNVs are less likely to
contain a pre-designed PR. For quantifying gene copy number
the ideal PRT assay will be between the first and last exons, a
situation that exists for around half of genes, although 80790%
of genes have an assay within 10 kb. For smaller CNVs and the
remaining 1&20% of genes, it may be possible to obtain assays
using the software directly with altered parameters. Despite the
high density of assays and clusters across the genome, there
remain intractable parts of the genome where assay design is
not possible, presumably because of the lack of suitable repeat
elements. For targets in these limited regions, an alternative tech-
nology such as conventional qPCR will be needed. It should be
noted that although the assays produced by PRTPrimer are
bioinformatically predicted to produce two distinguishable amp-
liﬁcation products, they require laboratory validation before use.

This resource is primarily focused on the human genome,
but the underlying software can be easily adapted for other

PRTPrimer to design assays for two other mammalian species
(mouse and rhesus macaque), but it could equally well be used
for invertebrate or plant genomes. The authors are happy to
advice researchers who would like to establish PRTPrimer for
other genomes in their own laboratories.

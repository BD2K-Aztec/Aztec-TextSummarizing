LOGICOIL

 

Their approach introduces a covariate indicator vector that
determines whether predictors are in or out of the model:

~ _ 1, if 5/ 75 0 (the j—th predictor is selected), (4)
' 0, if 5/ = 0 (the j—th predictor is not selected)

The parameter y is then included in Equation (3) so that:
zchyﬂm,+eC, c:l,...,C—l (5)

where X, are the elements of X set to 1, and ﬂay consists of
all the non—zero elements of ﬁe. For the Bayesian variable
selection scheme in Equation (5), the remaining task involved
the estimation of the indicator vector y = {y1, ..., yp} and the
corresponding ﬂ)“, and z(..

A Gibbs sampler is used to estimate all the parameters in the
model. Following from others, we choose a ‘ridge’ before
71(ﬂ) = Np(0, vIp) on the (C — 1) x p matrix of parameters B,
where NFQL, E) represents a p—multivariate normal distribution
with mean [L and covariance matrix E and IF is the p x p identity
matrix (Brown et al., 2002; Sha et al., 2004). It should be noted
that alternative choices of previous distribution also exist (Liang
et al., 2008; O’Hara and Sillanpaaa, 2009). The detailed deriv—
ation of the posterior distributions of the parameters and the
Gibbs sampler used to estimate the parameter vectors y,ﬂw
and z(. for Bayesian variable selection are identical to that of
Holmes and Held and Gustafson and Lefebvre (Gustafson and
Lefebvre, 2008; Holmes and Held, 2006).

3.3 Computing the response probabilities

For the development of LOGICOIL, we treated pairwise—
association selection and coiled—coil—oligomeric—state classiﬁca—
tion in two sequential steps. Pairwise associations were ﬁrst
selected using Bayesian variable selection. From the
{y(’),ﬂg’),zg’), t = 1, ..., T} MCMC samples obtained from the
Gibbs sampling scheme, the pairwise associations with the
highest posterior probability of inclusion were assumed to play
the strongest role in predicting the target coiled—coil
oligomeric state. Posterior inclusion probabilities were computed
according to:

1 T
pm = 1) = T2 y,” (6)
[:1

Where

0) _ 1, if y,~ was included in the model at the t—th iteration
’ _ 0, otherwise

Once the strongest pairwise associations had been identiﬁed,
the parameter values of the retained predictors were ﬁtted in a
separate model. Here, multinomial probit regression was chosen
to preserve consistency with the variable—selection process. There
is no closed form for the likelihood function of multinomial
probit models, but practical MCMC methods have been pro—
posed to compute parameter estimates. Here, parameter values
in the multinomial probit model were estimated using the MNL
library available in the R software (Imai and van Dyk, 2005a,b;
Team, 1993).

From the T samples {$0,220, I = 1, ..., T} of the secondary
MCMC scheme, the probability of a given test coiled—coil

sequence under each class was computed as:

T
p(y.~ = ch.~> =1TZ(<I>(X.~/3:’)> = max{<I>(X.~/3§’)>, 0>})
[:1

where <I>(.) is the multivariate normal distribution and X,- is the
(C — 1) x p dimensional vector for observation 1'.

4 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 Convergence of MCMC sampling schemes

For all the examples discussed below, the convergence of the
MCMC sampling schemes was assessed using multiple chains
with different random number seeds and starting values. The
number of iterations necessary for the MCMC sampling
scheme to converge, otherwise known as the burn—in, was esti—
mated at the point for which the independent MCMC runs dis—
played similar values. Autocorrelation in the MCMC samples
was also checked to ensure that the chains were mixing
adequately. Once a suitable bum—in period had been identified,
a single long chain was ran and used to compute parameter
estimates and posterior probabilities. In line with accepted guide—
lines, it was also ensured that the acceptance ratio of the
Metropolis—Hastings (MH) step was kept in the range of (2}
45%) during simulations (Gelman et al., 2004).

4.2 Pre-selection of variables

Bayesian variable selection provided a rigorous framework to
select the strongest predictor variables in a model, but was com—
putationally intensive given the large number of variables in the
model. To facilitate simulations and reduce the dimensions of
our data, a pre—selection ﬁlter was used to choose a smaller
subset of variables, to which Bayesian variable selection was
subsequently applied.

Let n(a1 —> r1,a2 —> r2, c) be the number of times the follow—
ing is observed: amino acid al at register position r1 and amino
acid a2 at register position r2 and response c in the dataset; anti—
parallel dimer, parallel dimer, trimer or tetramer. Using the
hypergeometric distribution, the probability of observing the
spatial interaction n(a1—> r1,a2 —> r2,c) exactly k times can
be written as:

p(n(a1 —> r1,a2 —> r2,c) = k)
_ n(a1—> r1,+ —> r2,c)n(+ —> r1,a2 —> r2,c) (8)
_ n(+, + ,c)

 

where the symbol+denotes summing out over all other amino
acids and c e {1, ..., C}. A two—sided p—value was assigned to
each observation and used to pre—select the most signiﬁcant pair—
wise associations. To avoid missing important predictor vari—
ables, a relaxed pre—selection criterion was taken by setting a
P—value threshold of 0.1.

LOGICOIL

 

MultiCoil and Multicoil2 did not compare favourably with other
algorithms. The performance of MultiCoil was possibly linked to
its training set, which is heavily biased towards long parallel
two—stranded coiled coils (Gruber et al., 2006). This caveat was
resolved in the recently retrained and redesigned Multicoil2 pre—
dictor, which improved the performance of MultiCoil but was
not to the level of the other predictors.

PrOCoil nearly matched LOGICOIL on two—state prediction,
and it would be interesting to evaluate how this method performs
on multi—state classiﬁcation. SCORER 2.0 also achieved high
discrimination rate, but it was slightly surpassed by PrOCoil
and LOGICOIL. Interestingly, SCORER 2.0 is the only algo—
rithm to include no pairwise residue effects in its predictive
model, which serves as a reminder that including pairwise residue
effects does not necessarily increase predictive power. Thus, we
suggest that pairwise—association information may not be so rele—
vant in the context of two—state prediction, which is rationalized
by the well—characterized differences between parallel dimeric
and trimeric coiled coils, that is, there were enough distinctive
features between the two structures so that the added sensitivity
gained from spatial associations was not necessary. Rather, it is
the construction of reliable training sets and methods to detect
relevant pairwise associations that seem most important. For
example, LOGICOIL and PrOCoil select pairwise associations
with a scheme that favours sparsity. Also, their performance was
reported with variable selection performed through external
cross—validation, whereas there are no indication that the same
procedure was applied during the original assessment of
MultiCoil and Multicoil2. In addition, higher—order information
may well be important in coiled—coil discrimination (Hadley
et al., 2008; Steinkruger et al., 2010). We also assessed how
straightforward homology—based searches using the BLAST
algorithm performed on multi—state classiﬁcation of coiled—coil
oligomeric state prediction (see Section 2 in the supporting
information). Again, the predictive accuracy obtained by
LOGICOIL significantly outperformed the BLAST predictions.

7 CONCLUSIONS

This work has introduced LOGICOIL, the first algorithm to
address the problem of predicting multiple coiled—coil oligomeric
states from protein—sequence information alone. LOGICOIL in—
creases our predictive coverage of the known coiled—coil struc—
tures from 31 to >90%, but also distinctly improves our ability
to differentiate between coiled—coil sequences of different oligo—
meric state. By taking into account the independent contribution
of amino acids at different register positions, and subsequently
including pairwise association effects between distantly pos—
itioned residues, we show that LOGICOIL achieves a high
discrimination rate when predicting the oligomeric state of
coiled—coil sequences across a range of structures, including anti—
parallel dimers, parallel dimers, trimers and tetramers. As the
only algorithm allowing for such extensive coverage of the
total coiled—coil population, LOGICOIL could not be bench—
marked against any other algorithms. However, when con—
strained to the limitations of the currently available coiled—coil
oligomeric state predictors, SCORER 2.0, MultiCoil and
PrOCoil, it was demonstrated that LOGICOIL offers equal or
superior predictive power.

Although the improvements that the LOGICOIL algorithm
brings to the ﬁeld of coiled—coil oligomeric state prediction are
clear, we propose that LOGICOIL may still beneﬁt from further
iterations. Most notably, the LOGICOIL algorithm is currently
constrained to the sole function of predicting coiled—coil oligo—
meric state while depending on third—party softwares for the de—
tection of coiled—coil domains in protein sequence. We suggest
that extending the LOGICOIL predictive function to also in—
clude coiled—coil domain prediction would greatly beneﬁt users,
as this would result in a truly free—standing software capable of
simultaneously predicting coiled—coil regions in a protein
sequence along with its associated oligomeric state. Although
LOGICOIL in its present form is capable of dealing with
heptad breaks such as stutters, stammers and skips, it is not
explicitly designed to account for the potential effects that may
result from these sequence discontinuities. Given the increasing
number of newly detected non—canonical coiled—coil sequences,
future work will focus on the retrieval of heptad—break speciﬁc
information to augment the predictive power and coverage of
LOGICOIL. Despite these minor caveats, we suggest that the
development of LOGICOIL, and the unique features it offers,
widens the breadth of opportunities for biologists and bioinfor—
maticians alike.

LOGICOIL is publicly and freely available via the world—wide
web at the following URL: http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/
LOGICOIL and can be used as stand—alone software for
known coiled—coil regions, or in conjunction with MARCOIL,
for coiled—coil region detection and oligomeric state assignment.

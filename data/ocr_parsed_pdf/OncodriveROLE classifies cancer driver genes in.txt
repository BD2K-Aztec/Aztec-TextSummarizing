ABSTRACT

Motivation: Several computational methods have been developed to
identify cancer drivers genes—genes responsible for cancer develop-
ment upon specific alterations. These alterations can cause the loss of
function (LoF) of the gene product, for instance, in tumor suppressors,
or increase or change its activity or function, if it is an oncogene.
Distinguishing between these two classes is important to understand
tumorigenesis in patients and has implications for therapy decision
making. Here, we assess the capacity of multiple gene features related
to the pattern of genomic alterations across tumors to distinguish be-
tween activating and LoF cancer genes, and we present an automated
approach to aid the classification of novel cancer drivers according to
their role.

Result: OncodriveROLE is a machine learning-based approach that
classiﬁes driver genes according to their role, using several properties
related to the pattern of alterations across tumors. The method shows
an accuracy of 0.93 and Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.84 clas-
sifying genes in the Cancer Gene Census. The OncodriveROLE clas-
sifier, its results when applied to two lists of predicted cancer drivers
and TCGA-derived mutation and copy number features used by the
classiﬁer are available at http://bg.upf.edu/oncodrive-role.

OncodriveROLE classifier is available at http://bg.upf.edu/oncodrive-

1 INTRODUCTION

Research in cancer genomics has identiﬁed hundreds of genes
involved in different stages of tumorigenesis due to speciﬁc som-
atic events. Single nucleotide variants, and large-scale ampliﬁca-
tions and deletions of chromosomal regions have been identiﬁed
as two of the main driver alterations in human tumors. The genes
suffering these alterations are traditionally classiﬁed as oncogenes
and tumor suppressors, depending on their role in cancer devel-
opment. When the product of tumor suppressors lose their func-
tion, tumor cells tend to proliferate faster. Driver alterations in
these genes frequently exhibit a recessive behavior. The loss of
function (LoF) can be achieved through truncating or missense
mutations, DNA deletions or hypermethylation of their pro-
moters. Some known LoF genes, most notably BRCA1 and
BRCA2, carry germline variants that increase the susceptibility
to develop a tumor because only one hit is required to inactivate

their function. Oncogenes, on the other hand, increase or change
their function upon somatic variants in tumorigenesis. Therefore,
their mode of action follow a dominant pattern, as one faulty copy
of the gene is frequently enough to provide the required pheno-
type. A copy number gain may exponentiate the oncogenic func-
tion of the gene; a point mutation may achieve the same result by
changing key amino acid residues, which results in constitutive
activation of the protein, or produce a new biochemical function.
These special cases are also regarded as activating driver muta-
tions, as the new function is gained much like in the case of classic
oncogenes. The Cancer Gene Census (CGC; Futreal et al., 2004) is
a regularly updated compilation of well-studied cancer genes,
which classiﬁes their mode of action as dominant or recessive,
following the oncogene/tumor suppressor paradigm, LoF and
Act (activated), hereafter. The CGC contains some 500 genes
implicated in cancer (November 2013). This is a rather small frac-
tion of the 20 000 genomes in the human genome (International
Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004), but recent large-
scale re-sequencing projects of tumor genomes (Hudson et al.,
2010) suggest many additional genes may be involved in tumori-
genesis. One important ﬁrst step in the analysis of datasets of
cancer genomics alterations is the identiﬁcation of the genes that
drive tumorigenesis. This is a non-trivial problem because tumor
samples contain up to thousands of somatic alterations. The list of
genes altered in tumors is heterogeneous, even within the same
cancer type. Therefore, the difﬁcult task is to distinguish between
driver and passenger alterations.

The most intuitive way to identify driver genes is to detect sig-
nals of positive selection across tumor samples because cancer cell
populations undergo a selection process during the progression of
the disease. Different methods that aim to identify driver genes
tackle different evidences to achieve their goal (Gonzalez-Perez
et al., 2013a). Two recent efforts to comprehensively identify
driver genes across large cohorts carried out by Lawrence et a].
(2014) and Tamborero et al. (2013b), combining several signals of
positive selection (Dees et al., 2012; Gonzalez-Perez and Lopez-
Bigas, 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013; Reimand et al., 2013) detected,
respectively, 291 and 260 likely driver genes.

Although years of experimental work have revealed the role of
most well-known cancer genes, now our capability of detecting
drivers has surpassed our capacity to probe their mode of action.
Thus, revealing the mode of action of driver genes in tumorigen-
esis is becoming crucial to fully understand the mechanisms of
tumorigenesis. This is essential for the development of new tar-
geted cancer therapies because as a general rule only Act drivers
are in principle susceptible to targeted drugs. Although excep-
tionally, some mutated tumor suppressors may be targeted (e. g.

Lambert et al., 2009), other strategies, such as synthetic lethality,
are needed to compensate for their LoF. This is the reason why
we need to develop bioinformatics approaches to make this clas-
sification as accurately as possible. Vogelstein et a]. recently
described the so-called ‘20/20 rule’ to detect tumor suppressor
genes and oncogenes based on their mutational pattern across
tumor samples (V ogelstein et al., 2013). It states that genes with
320% truncating mutations are tumor suppressors, whereas
genes with >20% of missense mutations in recurrent positions
are oncogenes. While it correctly detects and classiﬁes most of
the well-known cancer genes, the rule fails to identify drivers
included in newer catalogs (Tamborero et al., 2013b), mostly
the lowly recurrent ones.

Building upon the same idea, Davoli et a]. developed a ma-
chine learning approach to directly identify tumor suppressor
genes and oncogenes from the somatic alterations observed
across cohorts of tumor samples through their mutational and
copy number patterns. Many cancer drivers are recognized cor-
rectly by carefully selected features (Davoli et al., 2013).

We recently proposed a strategy to obtain a comprehensive list
of drivers minimizing the probability of detecting false-positive
ﬁndings by combining complementary methods that detected
different signals of positive selection (Tamborero et al., 2013b).

Once a list of high-conﬁdence drivers ﬂ-ICDs) is obtained, it is
important to classify those in their mode of action. To this aim, we
ﬁrst carefully assessed the capability of 30 features to differentiate
between these two groups of cancer genes. Then, we combined dif-
ferent sets of features with various classiﬁcation algorithms to
create several automated classiﬁers. We trained these classiﬁers
with CGC genes, and after careful check of their performance, we
selected a random forest algorithm that achieves an accuracy
(ACC) 0f 93%, which we call OncodriveROLE. It is the ﬁrst
freely available automatic classiﬁer that undertakes the task of as-
sessing the mode of action of driver genes. Used in this setting, it
may shed light upon the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in major
cancer types. We have used it to classify the two previously men-
tioned lists of mutational drivers that have been recently published,
namely, HCDs (Tamborero et al., 2013b) and Cancer5000
(Lawrence et al., 2014), and describe the results of this analysis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mutation data, copy number alteration data and
cancer driver lists

We retrieved data for the 17 TCGA (The Cancer Gene Census) projects
currently available without restriction: BLCA, BRCA, COAD/READ,
GBM, HNSC, KIRC, LAML, LGG, LUAD, LUSC, OV, PRAD,
SKCM, STAD, THCA and UCEC. We designed and computed several
features that we hypothesized might be useful to classify driver genes
according to the role using mutation and copy number data. These fea-
tures are based on the patterns of mutations and copy number alterations
(CNAs) across tumor samples. Tumors with at least one mutation in the
TCGA pan-cancer 17 dataset available at Synapse (syn1729383.2) were
retrieved after excluding those considered as hyperrnutators (Kandoth,
2014; Kandoth et al., 2013). Hyperrnutators of a tumor type contained
more than (Q3 + 4.5 x IQR) somatic mutations, where Q3 and IQR are
the third quartile and the interquartile range of the distribution of muta-
tions across all samples of the tumor type, respectively. After ﬁltering, the
pan-cancer 17 dataset was composed of 4327 samples. These mutations

were mapped to protein positions, and their consequence types were as-
sessed using the IntOGen-mutations pipeline (Gonzalez-Perez et al.,
2013b), which makes use of the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (v70;
Chen et al., 2010). The CNA status for all probed genes was downloaded
from the January run of the TCGA FIREHOSE pipeline at the Broad
Institute (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/).

To apply the OncodriveROLE classiﬁer, we gathered two lists of likely
cancer drivers from the Supplementary Material of two independent
papers (Lawrence et al., 2014; Tamborero et al., 2013b). From the
Tamborero et al. (2013b), we selected the list of 291 genes annotated as
HCDs, discarding one non-coding gene. From Lawrence et a]. (2013), we
obtained a list of 260 genes from the spreadsheet ‘Individual q-values’.

For comparison purposes, we retrieved the classiﬁcations of genes
carried out by the previous work by Davoli et a]. from the
Supplementary Material of their paper, applying the same cutoffs
described in the manuscript (Davoli et al., 2013). We also obtained the
classiﬁcation carried out by applying the 20/20 rule (Vogelstein et al.,
2013) to the mutational dataset of 17 tumors types.

Whenever possible, data were obtained associated to Ensembl gene
identiﬁers (Flicek et al., 2013). Other identiﬁers have been mapped to
Ensembl gene identiﬁers with a dataset obtained from Ensembl v70.

2.2 Classiﬁers

We chose six different classiﬁers to test: cforest.party (cforest method in R),
conditionalTree (ctree), logisticRegression (glm), naiveBayes (train),
simpleTree (rpart) and randomForest (Breiman, 2001; Hothorn et al.,
2006; Kuhn, 2008; Olshen et al., 1984; R Core Team, 2013). Some classiﬁers
either do not accept missing values or perform variable imputation for those.
Therefore, we opted to remove genes if they had missing values in one or
more of the features and leave them unclassiﬁed. From each classiﬁer we
obtained a score of the certainty that each gene belongs to the Act class.

2.3 Training set

To use cancer genes with well-established roles as training set, we down-
loaded the material available at the CGC in November 2013 (Futreal
et al., 2004). See below details on the curation of this dataset for training
the classiﬁer.

The CGC contains extensive and manually annotated information on
well-known cancer genes and classiﬁes the cancer genes into dominant
(Dom) and recessive (Rec) inﬂuence on tumorigenesis. We have used the
CGC classiﬁcation into Rec and Dom classes as proxy for LoF and Act
genes. Genes with ambiguous annotation, such as ‘Rec?’ or ‘Dom?’ or not
citing observed somatic mutations were discarded, leaving 381 entries (see
Supplementary Table S7 for their classiﬁcation). To only include CGC
driver genes, which are likely to act across the TCGA pan-cancer 17
cohort, we used a one-signal ﬁlter: we discarded genes not detected as
signiﬁcant by MutSigCV (recurrence signal), OncodriveFM (mutations
impact signal) or OncodriveCLUST (mutations clustering signal). We
also rejected genes with< 12 protein affecting mutations (PAMs;
Gonzalez-Perez and Lopez-Bigas, 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013;
Tamborero et al., 2013a). Only 115 CGC genes passed this ﬁlter.
Equally, all CGC genes that were solely associated to translocation
eventsiall labeled with Domiwere not allowed in the training set, ﬁ-
nally leaving 76 entries in the training set.

2.4 Computing features

All features we computed are listed in Table 1 along with a brief explanation
of their computation: some of them are similar to the ones used previously
(Davoli et al., 2013; Vogelstein et al., 2013). Truncating mutations include
mutations causing a frameshift, a gained or lost stop codon as well as mu-
tations in splice donor or acceptor sites. PAMs include truncating mutations
and missense mutations. Benign missense refers to missense mutations that

are categorized as low or unknown functional impact by TransFIC
(Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012). OncodriveFM P-values (Gonzalez-Perez and
Lopez-Bigas, 2012) and the location of OncodriveCLUST clusters of muta-
tions (Tamborero et al., 2013a) for all driver genes were obtained by running
the IntOGen-mutations pipeline on the TCGA pan-cancer 17 dataset.

The R implementation of Wilcoxon’s signed rank (R Core Team,
2013) was used to compare the distribution of each feature between the
CGC Rec and CGC Dom genes. We also used the variable importance
function from the party library (Hothorn et al., 2006; Strobl et al., 2008)
to rank features for their selection to be taken into account by the
classiﬁers.

2.5 Training and prediction

The selected CGC genes were therefore used as training set of the classiﬁers.
With all different classiﬁcation settings, we performed a leave—one-out cross-
validation: each item in the training set is classiﬁed with a model built with the
rest of the training set items. We found three genes whose initial classiﬁcation
extremely contradicted their CGC category: NOTCHl, NPMl and CEBPA

Table 1. List of mutational and CNA features for cancer driver genes

genes, which have evidence in the literature for a dual role (Halmos et al., 2002;
Sportoletti et al., 2008; Vogelstein et al., 2013). Therefore, we decided to dis-
card them from the training set. Thus, the ﬁnal, trimmed CGC training set
included 28 Dom and 4S Rec genes.

For the classiﬁcation of HCD and CancerSOOO genes, we considered
that values between 0.7 and 1 as Act and those with values between 0 and
0.3 as LoF. We computed the ACC and MCC (Matthew’s correlation
coefficient) of each classiﬁer at the leave-one-out cross-validation of the
training set. Furthermore, we calculated the coverage (COV) of the clas-
siﬁer, which reﬂects the percentage of the entire training set for which a
prediction could be made.

(see Table 1 for detailed description of each). All features elab-
orate on somatic mutation and CNA patterns across data from
the pan-cancer 17 cohort. We expected LoF genes to be affected
more frequently by deleterious events such as CNA loss and
truncating mutations. Act genes should be more frequently
ampliﬁed and receive protein-affecting non-truncating muta-
tions, which may increase and/or alter the protein function.

To select the most informative features for the task of
distinguishing between Act and LoF genes, we compared the
distribution of the features in both categories of CGC genes
(Fig. 1). The features we considered can be divided into four
broad categories (Fig. 1A): (i) features that measure the relative
abundance of truncating mutations, (ii) features that reﬂect the
CNA status of the gene across tumors, (iii) features that account
for the relative abundance of PAMs and (iv) features that meas-
ure the degree of clustering of missense mutations along the pro-
tein sequence.

Features in Group iii show the poorest performance to dis-
criminate between CGC Dom and CGC Rec genes (light blue in
Fig. 1A). On the other hand, all the features in Group i (green in
Fig. 1A) rank at the top of performance of all features analyzed.
As expected, this reﬂects that Act genes (or proto-oncogenes) are
intolerant to truncating mutations because an active protein

tions are the best discriminators for LoF and Act genes. Features
described in (B) are marked with asterisk. A detailed explanation of
each feature can be found in Table 1. (B) Box plots comparing the dis-
tribution of the three non-redundant top-ranking features that have been
selected for the OncodriveROLE classifier in CGC genes annotated as
Dom and Rec

product is required for tumorigenesis. In LoF (or tumor suppres-
sor) genes the truncation of the protein product gene is positively
selected, which facilitates the identiﬁcation of LoF candidates.
The best performing feature in this group was the ratio of trun-
cating mutations to the total number of coding mutations in the
protein (Fig. 1B).

The distribution of mutations within the gene (Group iv, dark
blue in Fig. 1A) differs signiﬁcantly between CGC Dom and
CGC Rec genes. The CGC Dom genes have fewer mutational
hotspots, detected as clusters by OncodriveCLUST, than CGC
Rec genes, whose mutations tend to be more evenly distributed
(Supplementary Fig. S1) along the protein sequence. This is
probably because Act driver genes receive mutations that po-
tentiate their function, e. g. by constitutively activating a regula-
tory site, or cause a switch of the protein function. To achieve
such behavior through mutations, these must occur at speciﬁc
places in the sequence, which results in fewer numbers of recur-
rent sites (clusters) than in CGC Rec genes (Supplementary Fig.
S1). We elaborated a series of features based on impact, fre-
quency and clustering of missense mutations. Many did not
show any power of discrimination of CGC Rec and Dom. The
features that perform reasonably well are based on the recurrence
of missense mutations. The best-performing feature in this group
compares the ratio of missense mutations with total number of
PAMs within OncodriveCLUST peaks (MUTS_
clusters_miss_VS_PAM; Fig. 1). Another feature in this group
that performs relatively well is the ratio recurrent missense mu-
tations (MUTS_missense_rec_freq).

All features in Group ii are designed to capture the known fact
that LoF genes have a tendency to be deleted, whereas Act genes
are more frequently affected by ampliﬁcations (Davoli et al.,
2013). In this case, we found that the ratio of ampliﬁcations to
deletions across all tumors in the cohort achieved the best sep-
aration of the two groups of genes.

3.2 Developing a classiﬁer to differentiate between LoF
drivers and Act drivers

Thereafter, we created a feature set that contained non-redun-
dant best-performing features from Groups i, ii and iv, disregard-
ing those of Group iii because of their poor performance
resulting in three features: MUTS_trunc_mutfreq,
MUTS_clusters_miss_VS_PAM and CNA_cbs_logratio_GvL.
We tested six machine learning approaches trained with the
trimmed version of the CGC (see Section 2). For each gene,
the classiﬁers produced a score of the likelihood that it belonged
to the CGC Dom class. A score of value 0 means that the clas-
siﬁer regards the gene as an LoF beyond all doubt, whereas a
score of value 1 means it exactly resembles the model of an Act
gene. We assessed the performance of each classiﬁer through the
ACC, the MCC and the COV of the driver set (all listed in
Supplementary Table S1). ACC and MCC validate the perform-
ance of the classiﬁers on the 76 CGC driver genes by means of a
leave-one-out cross-validation approach. We computed these
values for different classiﬁcation probabilities thresholds to
select the cutoff that maximize the ACC and MCC, even at the
cost of reducing the COV. Then, we used these sets of values to
choose the classiﬁer with the best performance and a reasonable
COV. Overall, randomForest produced the best results

OncodriveROLE classifies cancer driver genes

 

(Supplementary Table S1). We also trained classiﬁers with dif-
ferent combinations of the three selected features and included
MUTS_missense_rec_freq feature for testing purposes. We
found that multiple combinations of these features perform simi-
larly (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplemental Text). We
decided to use the randomForest classiﬁer trained with the
three non-redundant features shown in Figure 1B to create
OncodriveROLE, under the rationale that features representing
the three independent groups could provide more information to
classify novel drivers. The method shows an ACC of 0.94, MCC
of 0.84 and COV of 88% in the leave-one—out cross-validation.
We further tested OncodriveROLE in an independent set of
tumor suppressor genes (Zhao et al., 2013) that are not present
in the CGC. OncodriveROLE accurately classiﬁed 91.7% of
those genes as LoF drivers (Supplemental Text).

3.3 Applying OncodriveROLE to lists of cancer
driver genes

We identiﬁed two recent studies in which identiﬁed novel cancer
driver genes could be classiﬁed with OncodriveROLE. The ﬁrst
study detected cancer drivers by integrating four methods that
assess different signals of positive selection across samples of the
pan-cancer 12 dataset. This analysis resulted in 291 high-conﬁ-
dence cancer drivers (Tamborero et al., 2013b). In the second
study, MutsigCV was applied in a cohort of about 5000 tumor
samples to obtain a cancer driver list composed of 260 genes
(Lawrence et al., 2013, 2014). The two lists will be referred to
as HCD and Cancer5000 further on. Even though both lists have
similar sizes, their overlap is only 50%, making the two gene sets
different as can be seen in Figure 2. As for the training set, we
applied the one-signal ﬁlter to only predict the role of genes
possibly acting as drivers in the dataset under evaluation result-
ing in 200 HCD and 144 Cancer5000 genes.

The overall distribution of probabilities of these two groups of
genes is roughly bimodal in both driver lists, which allowed us to
choose these symmetric cutoff values (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Fig. S2) such as 0.3 and 0.7 for LoF and Act genes, respectively.
Other cutoffs may be used for the datasets under analysis depend-
ing on how strict a classiﬁcation the user wants for their list of
cancer drivers. Interestingly, we classiﬁed three CGC Dom genes
as LoF (‘Dom?’ in Fig. 2). The genes in question are NOTCHl,
NPM1 and CEBPA. All three have been implicated in leukemia
(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; Liu et al., 2013;
Ohlsson et al., 2014) and both NOTCHl and NPM1 are anno-
tated in the CGC as partners of translocation events in leukemia.
NOTCHl has been described as an oncogene as well as a tumor
suppressor. Its actual role may depend on the tumor type (Licciulli
et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Vogelstein et al., 2013). Equally,
CEBPA and NPM1 have been characterized as tumor suppressors
in the literature (Halmos et al., 2002; Sportoletti et al., 2008). We
cannot be certain of the functional impact of the translocation on
the function of the product of the fused gene. It may associate to a
new promoter and change its expression accordingly, or it may be
truncated as a result of the fusion and thus function as an LoF.
For this reason, we had previously excluded all CGC Dom genes
that are solely associated to translocation events in the Census.
The plot in Figure 2 shows those genes labeled as DomT, and their

classiﬁcation shows no clear resemblance to LoF or Act, which
supports our decision to remove them from the training set.

3.4 Comparison of OncodriveROLE with other
bioinformatics approaches

The 20—20 rule was created to identify mutational driver genes,
both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (V ogelstein et al.,
2013). Therefore, it differs from OncodriveROLE, designed to
classify previously identiﬁed driver genes into their most probable
roles. The simple 20-20 rule reaches a high ACC (Table 2) when
applied to the trimmed CGC list. However, it is unable to reach a
decision on many drivers where none of its two estimators (see
Section 2) surpasses the threshold of 20% (Tables 2 and 3).

We also compared the results obtained by the approach de-
signed by Davoli et a]. (2013), implemented in a classiﬁer named
Tuson. As with the 20-20 rule, Tuson was created to distinguish
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes from genes with passen-
ger mutations, instead of classifying previously identiﬁed cancer
drivers as is the case of OncodriveROLE. We found
OncodriveROLE slightly outperforms Tuson in ACC and
MCC on the trimmed CGC dataset. Note that Tuson method
was trained with CGC genes, and the performance reported in
Table 2 does not remove genes in the training set, as it is done in
the leave-one-out cross-validation of OncodriveROLE. We can
conclude that well-known cancer genes are classiﬁed with a high

Prob. of predicted Act

Fig. 2. Classiﬁcation of 200 (HCD list) and 144 (Cancer5000 list) cancer
driver genes into the classes Act and LoF. The training set of
OncodriveROLE constitutes of all ‘Dom’ and ‘Rec’ labeled data points.
‘Dom?’ are CGC-annotated dominant genes excluded from the training
set because of strong resemblance to the ‘Rec’ genes and previous litera-
ture evidence of this role. ‘DomT’ genes are CGC-annotated dominant
genes only citing translocation events as prove and therefore not included
in the training set. All ‘-’ labeled data points are driver genes not anno-
tated in CGC, and whose prediction was the main goal of the study. The
thresholds are drawn at 0.3 (as top limit of the LoF class) and 0.7 (as
bottom limit of the Act class). Working with classiﬁcation score thresh-
olds of 0.3 (as top limit of the LoF class) and 0.7 (as bottom limit of the
Act class), we classiﬁed 109 genes as LoF, 76 as Activating and left 15
genes as unclassiﬁed in the HCD list; meanwhile, we classiﬁed 97 genes as
LoF, 43 as Activating and left 4 genes as unclassiﬁed (Fig. 2) in the
Cancer5000 list. Genes for which we have observed <12 mutations
were directly classiﬁed as ‘No class’ and assigned NA values in the clas-
siﬁcations results (see Supplementary Tables S4 and S6)

the role of novel cancer drivers in tumorigenesis.

4 DISCUSSION

Two main rationales to detect LoF and Act driver genes acting
across tumor samples exist. The ﬁrst approach consists in dir-
ectly detecting genes that exhibit known alterations patterns cor-
responding to these two classes from mutations and CNA data.
This strategy was ﬁrst conceptualized by Vogelstein et a]. (2013)
to be implemented later on as a machine learning algorithm by
Davoli et a]. (2013). In the second approach, ﬁrst driver genes
acting in tumor samples are detected by combining the signals of
positive selection they exhibit (Lawrence et al., 2014; Tamborero
et al., 2013b). Then, in a second step, these drivers are classiﬁed
into the two aforementioned classes exploiting similar alteration
patterns as in the first approach. This second two-step approach
has two main advantages. First, genes that do not exhibit clear
alterations pattern that deﬁne them as LoF or Act can still be
detected as drivers if they show clear signals of positive selection.
Second, the combination of several signals controls the ratio of

false-positive drivers identiﬁed (Tamborero et al., 2013b), which
is unattainable to the direct classiﬁcation of genes.

This is the reason why we have decided to develop
OncodriveROLE, a machine learning classiﬁer, which takes a
list of pre-selected driver genes and sorts them according to
their mode of action. We ﬁrst carefully compared and selected
a set of features that best captures the differences of alterations
patterns of these two groups of drivers. We then used those fea-
tures to train the classiﬁer, on a carefully trimmed subset of the
CGC genes. When applied to two recent lists of drivers, we found
that, even under strict classiﬁcation conditions, OncodriveROLE
was able to classify more drivers than the 20—20 rule and the
Tuson machine learning algorithm.

The OncodriveROLE validation procedure identiﬁed several
likely misclassiﬁed drivers in the CGC. The most salient ex-
amples of these are probably some genes that drive hematopoi-
etic malignancies upon translocation and fusion with other
genomic regions, all classiﬁed as Dom in the GCG. However,
when analyzed using mutational and CNAs data from the pan-
cancer 17 dataset, some of them appear as clear LoF drivers. For
instance, OncodriveROLE assigns MLL, RUNXl and SUZl2
classiﬁcation probabilities under 0.003 (see Supplementary
Tables S37S6 for feature and classiﬁcation values). These genes
could be Act drivers upon fusion to other genes, but LoF upon
mutations.

Even though OncodriveROLE is able to classify most of the
genes in the two drivers lists as LoF or Act, it still leaves few of
them unclassiﬁed. Some of these correspond to lowly recurrent
drivers whose mutational features are not correctly computed
because of the scarcity of their alterations. Sequencing more
tumors will certainly improve their classiﬁcation. Others may
not have a clear enough pattern to be classiﬁed in one of the
two classes, as they could be exhibiting different roles in different
contexts. In some rare cases, the method misclassiﬁes known
cancer genes. For example, KEAPl is classiﬁed as an Act
driver, although it is reported to lose its function upon mutation
(Hayes and McMahon, 2009; Shibata et al., 2008). A close look
at its mutational pattern reveals missense mutations dominate
and accumulate in certain regions of the protein. As member
of a ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis complex, the function of
KEAPl is probably essential to the cell, and its impairment is
likely lethal. Therefore, few truncating mutations may appear in
KEAPl, and it is ultimately misclassiﬁed by OncodriveROLE.
Future finer measurements of the impact of missense mutations
may help correcting this problem.

Summing up, in this article, we have described the develop-
ment and validation of OncodriveROLE, an approach to differ-
entiate between LoF and Act driver genes. The OncodriveROLE
classiﬁer is freely available at http://bg.upf.edu/oncodrive-role as
an R object that researchers may use to classify the drivers they
have detected across a cohort of tumor samples. At the same
URL, the pre-computed TCGA pan-cancer 17 mutational and
copy number features used for the classiﬁcation are available for
download.

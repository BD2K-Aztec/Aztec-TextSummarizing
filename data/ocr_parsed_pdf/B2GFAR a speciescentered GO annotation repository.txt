ABSTRACT

Motivation: Functional genomics research has expanded
enormously in the last decade thanks to the cost reduction in high-
throughput technologies and the development of computational
tools that generate, standardize and share information on gene and
protein function such as the Gene Ontology (GO). Nevertheless,
many biologists, especially working with non-model organisms, still
suffer from non-existing or low-coverage functional annotation, or
simply struggle retrieving, summarizing and querying these data.
Results: The Blast2GO Functional Annotation Repository (B2G-
FAR) is a bioinformatics resource envisaged to provide functional
information for otherwise uncharacterized sequence data and offers
data mining tools to analyze a larger repertoire of species than
currently available. This new annotation resource has been created
by applying the Blast2GO functional annotation engine in a strongly
high-throughput manner to the entire space of public available
sequences. The resulting repository contains GO term predictions
for over 13.2 million non-redundant protein sequences based on
BLAST search alignments from the SIMAP database. We generated
GO annotation for approximately 150000 different taxa making
available 2000 species with the highest coverage through B2G-FAR.
A second section within B2G-FAR holds functional annotations for
17 non-model organism Affymetrix GeneChips.

Conclusions: B2G-FAR provides easy access to exhaustive
functional annotation for 2000 species offering a good balance
between quality and quantity, thereby supporting functional
genomics research especially in the case of non-model organisms.
Availability: The annotation resource is available at
http://www.b2gfar.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Functional genomics research has gained importance in the last
decade thanks to the fast improvement and cost reduction in

high-throughput technologies. Beyond traditional model species,
also non-model organisms are in the genomics race and today it
is hard to ﬁnd a biological domain without a functional genomics
initiative. This expansion would not have been that successful
without the accompanying development of computational tools
that generate, standardize and share information on gene and
protein function. The Gene Ontology (GO) project is one such
standard. G0 is a collaborative effort aiming at the establishment
of a controlled vocabulary that provides biologically meaningful
annotations for gene (products) across species (Ashbumer et al.,
2000). There are two main aspects of this project: (a) the deﬁnition of
a comprehensive ontology of functional terms and (b) the generation
of an annotation database containing the assignment of GO terms
to genes and proteins (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2008).
Annotation for each organism in the GO database is supplied
and maintained by the respective consortium member. Evidence
codes (ECs) are added to each individual annotation to reﬂect the
information source used in a GO term assignment. ECs indicate
if the annotation is supported by some (and which) experimental
evidence, whether it was transferred (and how) from related genes
or if it was generated by other prediction methods. The large majority
of GO annotations is centralized in the Gene Ontology Annotation
(GOA) Database (Camon et al., 2004). This resource contains high-
quality functional annotations for proteins mostly obtained from the
UniProt Knowledgebase (The Uniprot Consortium, 2007). However,
the great majority (~95%) of GO corresponds to automatically
transferred annotations based on InterProScan (Quevillon et al.,
2005) results. Currently, only a small number of assignments have
experimental evidence or are revised by expert curators. While the
GO project is improving the ontology deﬁnition and quality of the
GOA database (Barrell et al., 2009), it is still far from providing
extensive ﬁinctional annotation for the wealth of sequence data that
populate public databases. However, thanks to the structured and
universal nature of GO, large-scale annotation using an automated
process is conceivable and could be feasible given that adequate
computational resources are available. Such an annotation effort
complement current established annotation initiatives by generating
preliminary functional labels for sequences not yet covered by any of
the reference projects of the GO consortium. Examples of functional
data-intensive resources in the ﬁeld of ﬁinctional genomics such
as the Integr8 (Kersey et (11., 2005) and PEDANT (Riley, 1993)

projects, which offer genome-oriented views on different types of
annotation data, can be found. An example of a specialized resource
in the area of functional plant genomics is the PlexDB (Wise et (11.,
2007), a project to support transcriptomics studies on plants and
plant pathogens. Although these resources provide comprehensive
information on many genomic aspects, they do not represent a
universal resource where up-to-date large-scale functional data on
species can be readily accessed and analyzed. The Blast2GO project
started in 2005 to build an universal bioinformatics platform for the
ﬁinctional annotation and analysis of novel sequence data (Conesa
et (11., 2005). The tool was designed to provide high-throughput
and quality assignments with a user interface strongly based on
visualization and intuitive use (Gotz et (11., 2008) (Conesa and Gotz,
2008). So far, Blast2GO has been used in nearly 300 ﬁinctional
proﬁling projects involving a wide range of model and non-model
species, from bacteria and ﬁingi, through arthropods and mollusks,
to plants, avian, ﬁsh and mammals, which evidences the strong
need for functional annotations beyond that provided by public
sequence databases. During the last 5 years of Blast2GO, we have
witnessed many cases of redundant annotation of public data by
different labs and limitations for keeping results updated. These
facts, in combination with the annotation gaps mentioned above,
have encouraged us to consider the generation of an extensive
repository of automatic ﬁinctional annotation making use of the
widely accepted ﬁinctional annotation engine Blast2GO. Lastly
advances in supercomputing and distributed computing have paved
the way for undertaking highly intensive genome analysis tasks as
demonstrated by many examples in different research ﬁelds such
as proteomics (Marti-Renom et (11., 2007), phylogenomics (Huerta-
Cepas et (11., 2007; Sjolander, 2004) and sequence analysis (Rattei
et (11., 2008). In this work, we have made use of these technologies
to create the Eunctional Annotation Repository (B2G-FAR), a web-
based large-scale resource of precomputed ﬁinctional annotations.
Generated by pipelines of intensive computing, B2G-FAR is a
centralized repository of automatically annotated sequence data,
which can directly be downloaded and used, saving processing
time and avoiding redundant processing. The resource covers all
biological kingdoms and is structured in such a way that easy
download and processing of data for a species of interest is possible.
The B2G-FAR follows the philosophy of Blast2GO development:
(i) high throughput: over 25 million sequences have been processed
and 2000 species are now present in the B2G-FAR database;
(ii) the application to functional genomics projects: the repository
contains GO term predictions for both, gene products and probe
set collections of Affymetrix GeneChips; and (iii) user friendly:
annotations are provided in the form of plain text ﬁles for direct
download. The main beneﬁt is obtained in the case of non-model
species where ﬁinctional information and bioinformatics resources
are limited.

2 METHODS

2.1 Construction

The data contained in the B2G-FAR repository consists of two parts: species-
centered functional annotations obtained through the Simap2GO project and
a collection of microarray probe set annotations. Although generated by
different pipelines, both data sources implement the same basic annotation
scheme as established by Blast2GO (Gotz at (11., 2008): (i) sequence
similarity search (BLAST) (Altschul at (11., 1990) to obtain a list of potential

homologues;, (ii) mapping of the corresponding GO terms and their evidence
codes for all BLAST hits; and (iii) the annotation step applying the Blast2GO
annotation rule taking into account GO evidence codes, the GO hierarchy and
the degree of sequence similarity (an extensive explanation of the Blast2GO
annotation rule can be found in the Supplementary Material). In a ﬁnal step,
protein domains, families and motifs are identiﬁed through InterProScan
and the corresponding GO terms are merged with the already transferred
annotations taking care of redundancies and GO hierarchy.

S imapZGO data and processing: Simap2GO is the result of the collaboration
between the SIMAP (Rattei at (11., 2008) and Blast2GO projects. SIMAP is
a database ﬁrst published in 2005 (Arnold at (11., 2005), which provides an
all-against-all sequence similarity matrix containing precalculated pairwise
comparisons of almost all publicly available proteins. Computations
are accomplished by volunteer grid computing based on the Berkeley
Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). By May 2010,
SIMAP contained over 29 million non-redundant sequences covering the
content of all major public sequence resources. The Simap2GO project,
with the ambitious goal of functionally annotating this comprehensive
sequence space, adopted and applied successfully the Blast2GO annotation
methodology to the SIMAP resource. Blast2GO is primarily based on
sequence similarity and therefore perfectly suited to be run on the SIMAP
database.

The computation of the annotations is run in parallel for the entire
sequence space. For each uncharacterized sequence, GO annotated (only
non-electronic annotations) homologues are retrieved from the SIMAP
sequence similarity matrix. The applied Blast2GO method selects the GO
terms above a given conﬁdence threshold according to the established
annotation rule. Here, the algorithm takes into account the actual sequence
similarity, the original GO evidence code and the location of the potentially
transferred GO term within the hierarchy (see the Supplementary Material
for a more detailed description of the Blast2GO annotation strategy and
annotation parameters). Apart from the annotation transfer through potential
homologues, Simap2GO makes use of the InterPro domain information also
provided in a precalculated manner by SIMAP. This information is merged
with the already predicted assignments to improve and increase the GO term
assignment. The sequence annotations generated in this way are stored in
the B2G-FAR database and the routine continues with the next unprocessed
sequence until completion (see Fig. 1). One entire annotation process takes
approximately 3 days with 10 CPUs running in parallel and with direct access
to the SIMAP database. The annotation of the same amount of sequence data

without precalculated alignments would have taken over half a year on a 150
CPU cluster. All annotations are further processed to summarize and present
species-centered information online. Available charts and data ﬁles are given
in the Supplementary Table S 1.

Mieorarray probe set data: the probe-set collection of 17 Affymetrix
GeneChip designs corresponding to non-model species was annotated
with Blast2GO. As GeneChip probe sets do not necessarily target protein
sequences available in public databases, their functional annotation cannot
be recovered by Simap2GO and therefore has been computed using local
resources. FASTA ﬁles containing the target sequences of the probe sets were
downloaded from the ofﬁcial Affymetrix web site. The annotation pipeline
started by splitting source FASTA ﬁles into smaller chunks and launching
them against a distributed BLAST setup. A 150 CPU cluster at the CIPF
Bioinformatics and Genomics Department was used to run BLAST searches
against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) database. Simultaneously, protein
domain information was obtained through a local installation of InterProScan
(Quevillon et a1., 2005). Once BLAST and InterProScan searches were
completed, results for every species were gathered and processed within
Blast2GO for automatic function prediction. Charts were generated during
the annotation process and are provided online in Supplementary Table S3.
Finally, to assess the coverage of annotation results, each GeneChip was
compared with the GO information provided by Affymetrix. All currently
annotated and available datasets are listed in the Supplementary Table S2.

2.2 Contents

B2G-FAR presents contents in a user-friendly data sheet concept based
on Wiki technology. All the given information (annotations, data ﬁles,
images) is generated beforehand by the B2G-FAR annotation pipeline and
is summarized on automatically generated web pages. This facilitates fast
access to data ﬁles, images and charts describing genome-wide information.
Annotation data can be further Visualized and analyzed through its upload
into the Blast2GO application (see below: Download and query options).
B2G-FAR is periodically updated every 6 months.

Species annotations: by applying the above-described steps, we could assign
GO terms to 14 million sequences that represents ~56.4% of the entire
SIMAP database (excluding metagenomic data). The remaining sequences
are entries without signiﬁcant alignments (35.7%) or that did not surpass
the annotations quality threshold (7.7%). Sequences from ~150000 taxa
were functionally annotated and the 2000 most represented species are now
available through B2G-FAR. Table 1 contains the numbers of annotated
sequences compared with the whole SIMAP dataset and the available source
annotations by the GO. Species can be accessed directly by their scientiﬁc
name or NCBI taxa ID through a search function. For every species,
several precalculated ﬁles and statistical charts are available. These include
a G0 annotation ﬂat ﬁle and its corresponding GO-Slim version. Statistical
charts provide information about GO annotation distributions, GO level
distributions or about the most abundant functional terms within one of the
three GO categories.

Microarray annotations: This section is organized as annotation sheets for
each probe-set collection corresponding to the 17 non-model Affymetrix
GeneChips. Model species Affymetrix chips were purposely not included
in the repository as there already exist extensive functional annotation
projects. The annotation sheet contains detailed information on the Blast2GO
annotation process from the BLAST step up to the augmentation by ANNEX
[a data mining procedure to annotate from links between molecular function
and biological process/cellular component GO terms (Myhre et a1., 2006)]
and InterProScan. In contrast to the previous section, which provides only
ﬁnal annotation records, the microarray probe-set annotation sheets include
a great variety of descriptive charts that offer a comprehensive View of the
functional information contents gathered throughout the annotation pipeline.
Likewise, Blast2GO project ﬁles are provided. The charts and ﬁles included
in the annotation sheets are listed in the Supplementary Table S3.

Table 1. Simap2GO annotation coverage: the table shows the number of
Blast2GO-annotated sequences in relation to the whole SIMAP dataset (May
2010) and the number of GO sequences which has been used as annotation
source/reference dataset

Only sequences with at least one non-electronic annotations (non-IEA) were used (GO-
Lite data-set). Additionally, the number of sequences which could not be annotated is
given, i.e. sequences without sequence alignments and sequences whose annotations
did not surpass the annotation threshold.

Download ana1 query options: in both Species and Microarray sections,
ﬁnal annotation ﬁles are provided in plaintext format as GO and GO-
Slim data. The text ﬁle format allows direct upload into the Blast2GO
application for further analysis of annotation results as well as integration in
other applications accepting GO annotation data. Additionally, all species
annotations are available in the standard GO annotation format. Some
descriptive charts are included in B2G-FAR for a quick overview of
the results. Dynamic access to the data is provided by the Blast2GO
Java application. This guarantees optimal reutilization and synchrony
within Blast2GO developments. For example, new query options have
been incorporated into Blast2GO to support diverse access to B2G-FAR
data (see online tutorial available as Supplementary Material). Annotated
sequences can be queried and ﬁltered by their name/id, description, GO code
and GO name, either as exact or ‘contains’ matches. Existing Blast2GO
functions such as the generation of summary charts, single or combined
graphs, annotation pies and enrichment analysis can be performed for the
sequences selected by the user. Moreover, the .annot ﬁles from B2G-
FAR are fully compatible with the Babelomics suite (Al-Shahrour et a1.,
2008; http://www.babelomics.org) for functional proﬁling analysis, where
additional statistical methods for pathway analysis [FatiGO (Al-Shahrour
et a1., 2004) and FatiScan (Al-Shahrour et a1., 2007)] are available. This
is especially interesting in the case of microarray probe ﬁles or when a
functional enrichment needs to be assessed with experimental data involving
any of the non-model species included in the repository.

Comparison of BZG-FAR annotations with GO annotations: the quality
of the Blast2GO annotation method has been extensively assessed and
proved in previous works (Conesa and Gotz, 2008; Conesa et a1., 2005;
Gotz et a1., 2008). However, we performed an additional evaluation of the
annotation process to provide B2G-FAR users with a general feeling of
the performance and nature of the annotations contained in the repository.
We selected 10000 random sequences from B2G-FAR which were also
present in the GO database and compared their annotations. We recorded
the number of exact GO term matches, more speciﬁc or more general
terms (different speciﬁcity levels of the annotation), other branch or other
GO category (true novel annotations) as described previously (Gotz et a1.,
2008). Results are given in Table 2. The comparison study revealed that
most of the original GO annotations (93.5%) were contained in the B2G-
FAR repository as exact matches and more speciﬁc/ general terms and only a
small fraction (6.5%) were lost (other GO branch and category annotations)
during the annotation process, presumably due to GO version differences
or the removal of root category terms in the B2G-FAR repository. When
comparing in the opposite direction, we observed that 49% of the B2F-FAR
annotations were represented as exact matches in the GOA, and an additional
13% of terms are provided as more speciﬁc concepts. The remaining 38%

are terms in other branches and in other main GO categories. To have an
impression on the nature of these novel B2G-FAR annotations, we checked
manually 20 randomly selected sequences for which differences between
the two databases were found (see manual_evaluation.xls in Supplementary
Material). Curation of the novel GO terms implied contrasting against
scientiﬁc papers and established functional databases, such as UniProt, Tair,
Saccharomyces Genome Database, Entrez, etc. From these 20 sequences
one (AT5G35370.1) resulted to have doubtful sequence identity and was not
considered in further computations. The remaining 19 sequences accounted
for 109 novel GO terms, 9 of which could not be veriﬁed from the
available literature. One sequence (Cyclin CLB2 of S.eerevisiae) obtained
4 presumably false GO functions due to sequence similarity to a paralogue
with different functional speciﬁcation. The remaining 96 GO terms (88%)
were conﬁrmed from literature data and assessed as valid annotations.
These results evidence the quality of the GO term assignments contained
in B2G-FAR.

3 UTILITY

We illustrate the utility of the B2G-FAR on two examples of
ﬁinctional genomics studies taken from the literature and show how
B2G-FAR can speed up or facilitate new data analyses.

The ﬁrst example is in the ﬁeld of next-generation sequencing
(NGS). These methods are rapidly extending within the genomics
community as they greatly outperform both in sensitivity and
accuracy hybridization-based approaches. B2G-FAR can support
ﬁinctional assessment in NGS research. In a pioneering study,
Holt and colleagues analyzed genome variation and evolution in
Salmonella typhi using NGS (Holt et (11., 2008). The authors applied
454 and Solexa technologies to resequence 19 different S.typhi
strains and isolates. The authors carried out a phylogenetic analysis
of SNPs variance and identiﬁed genome insertions, deletions and
modiﬁed genes across strains. However, although the impact of
genomic changes on certain coding regions was discussed, no
genome-wide functional analysis of strain variations was attempted.
By typing S.typhi on the B2G-FAR species search box, we can
readily locate the annotation ﬁle for this species, which contains
GO assignments for 3917 genes (Supplementary Fig. S1). GeneBank
IDs included in the annotation ﬁle provide the means for matching
ﬁinctional and genomic variation data. This annotation ﬁle can be
opened with the Blast2GO software and by uploading each list
of strain-speciﬁc varying genes, Blast2GO functions can be used
to interrogate data for signiﬁcant functional differences between
isolates at the genome level, and to obtain the functional proﬁling
of the genomic alterations or to locate mutated genes in metabolic

pathways. This example illustrates how readily available functional
data can complement the analysis of experimental results with little
additional effort.

The second example relates to the use of Affymetrix probe-
set annotation data available at the repository. B2G-FAR offers
an annotation coverage which is substantially higher than the
NetAffx GO annotations provided by the manufacturer and
also has fast and reliable access to ﬁinctional data for these
GeneChips. The study by Espinoza et (11. (2007) can serve as
an illustrative example for this section of the repository. The
article presents a transcriptomics analysis of viral infection in
wine grape cultivars using the Affymetrix Grape GeneChip.
In this study, authors generated ﬁinctional annotations for up-
and downregulated gene groups through similarity-based function
transfer from Arabidopsis thaliana by WU-BLAST, GO terms
being directly transferred for all retrieved alignments. The obtained
annotation was summarized to reﬂect the abundance of distinct
functional classes within regulated genes. Although valid, this
basic ﬁinctional description does not allow the identiﬁcation of
those functional categories which are speciﬁcally activated at viral
infection. For this, a ﬁinctional comparison to the whole genome
represented in the array would be required, which implies that
functional data for all probes would be needed. This information,
absent in the article and presumably costly for the authors to
obtain, is readily available from the B2G-FAR site. The B2G-
FAR annotation ﬁle for the Grape GeneChip contains 54 841 GO
terms and covers 11971 probe sets. The list of differentially
expressed genes provided in the article as Supplementary Material
was used in Blast2GO to perform a GO term enrichment
analysis based on the B2G-FAR annotation ﬁle. The analysis
indicated a signiﬁcant overrepresentation of chloroplast genes in the
Camnre downregulated gene set (adjusted P-value: 1.2 X 10_5) (see
Supplementary Fig. S2a) and only a slight enrichment of membrane,
L—arginine and L—glutamate import and other membrane transport
activities (P-values: 6X10_3) for the upregulated gene set (see
Supplementary Fig. S2b).

4 DISCUSSION

The major purpose of B2G-FAR is to offer biologists easy
access to ﬁinctional information. B2G-FAR has been conceived
as a repository of automatic annotations generated by Blast2GO
using high-throughput computing technologies to save annotation
time to the ﬁinctional genomics community. The B2G-FAR is
species centered, which means that data can readily be obtained
for any of the 2000 organisms present in the database. The
Blast2GO annotation strategy has shown to render good recall
values for sequence similarity function transfer methods and to
match ﬁinctional assignments by curated computational analysis
(G6tz et (11., 2008). The B2G-FAR retains these quality levels: we
showed that the majority of B2G-FAR assignments are identical
or functionally related to GO Database annotations for sequences
present in this database and, additionally, novel predictions are
generally supported by the available literature. It should be stressed,
however, that the quality of B2G-FAR is closely linked to the
completeness and accuracy of the GO and InterPro databases.
B2G-FAR complements the GO effort by offering high-throughput
automatic annotations on a species basis. Compared with GOA,
where automatically generated annotations are to a big extent based

on protein domains, B2G-FAR combines both sequence similarity-
based annotations through Blast2GO together with domain-based
information through InterProScan. In this way, GO term assignments
could be increased in number and the amount of available annotated
sequences could be nearly doubled. Comparing the generated
Affymetrix GeneChip annotations to the current GO annotation
available at the NetAffx site, the B2G-FAR resource increased
the coverage of ﬁinctional annotations from an average of 7.89%
(NetAffx) to 40.89% (Blast2GO) (Fig. 2). Only the Bovine and
Chicken NetAffx annotations were richer than the ones generated by
Blast2GO due to intensive proteome annotation efforts of GOA in
collaboration with the International Protein Index (Barrell et (11.,
2009). Currently, most of the GeneChips of non-model species
processed in B2G-FAR contain sufﬁcient annotation coverage for
a successful evaluation of microarray results in terms of pathways
and biological functions. Moreover, the compatibility of B2G-
FAR ﬁle formats with ﬁinctional proﬁling tools make ﬁinctional
assessment methods readily accessible for a much larger diversity
of organisms. Finally, B2G-FAR should not be understood as a
competitive annotation source to annotation projects as carried out
within the GO consortium, nor as a replacement to high-quality
manual annotation of single-gene products, but as a complementing
resource. Although automated annotation is by nature more error
prone than manually curated one, B2G-FAR offers novel valuable
information, making ﬁinctional data accessible to a large users
community working on different species.

5 CONCLUSIONS

B2G-FAR provides easy access to exhaustive ﬁinctional information
for a broad range of species encompassing most organisms under
genome investigation. The repository is simple in architecture and
still offers many analysis possibilities through the proximity to the
Blast2GO software. In its current form, the resource is species
centric. Future developments will consider multispecies scenarios
such as metagenomics data or comparisons across taxa.

6 AVAILABILITY AND REQUIREMENTS

The annotation resource is freely available at
http://b2gfar.bioinfo.cipf.es, is based on the DokuWiki framework
and works with any common web browser. There are no other
requirements or plugins needed to use the repository. Data ﬁles can
be downloaded and unzipped or directly uploaded into the Blast2GO
application through Java WebStart technology. Therefore, Java has
to be installed. For both, B2G-FAR and Blast2GO, tutorials and
quick-start sections are provided online.

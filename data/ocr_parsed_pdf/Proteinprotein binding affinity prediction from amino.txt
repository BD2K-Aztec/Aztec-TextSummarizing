ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein—protein interactions play crucial roles in many bio-
logical processes and are responsible for smooth functioning of the
machinery in living organisms. Predicting the binding affinity of pro-
tein—protein complexes provides deep insights to understand the rec-
ognition mechanism and identify the strong binding partners in
protein—protein interaction networks.

Results: In this work, we have collected the experimental binding af-
finity data for a set of 135 protein—protein complexes and analyzed the
relationship between binding affinity and 642 properties obtained from
amino acid sequence. We noticed that the overall correlation is poor,
and the factors influencing affinity depends on the type of the complex
based on their function, molecular weight and binding site residues.
Based on the results, we have developed a novel methodology for
predicting the binding affinity of protein—protein complexes using se-
quence-based features by classifying the complexes with respect to
their function and predicted percentage of binding site residues. We
have developed regression models for the complexes belonging to
different classes with three to five properties, which showed a correl-
ation in the range of 0139—0992 using jack-knife test. We suggest
that our approach adds a new aspect of biological significance in
terms of classifying the protein—protein complexes for affinity
prediction.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteiniprotein interactions are crucial prerequisite for many
biological interactions involved in cellular signaling, immunity,
cellular transport, etc. It is important to identify the interacting
pairs of proteins and their strength of interaction for understand-
ing the functions in proteiniprotein interaction networks. In the
past, several studies have been carried out to understand the
principle and recognition mechanism of proteiniprotein com-
plexes (Gromiha et al., 2009), and most of them suggested the
importance of amino acid residues located at the interface of
the two interacting proteins for the recognition process

(Chakrabarti and Janin, 2002; Tuncbag et al., 2011). Recently,
Kastritis et a]. (2014) suggested that along with the interface
residues, non-interface residues also play a key role in proteini
protein interactions.

Experimentally, proteiniprotein interactions have been mainly
studied with the yeast two-hybrid system, Forster/ﬂuorescence
resonance energy transfer, surface plasmon resonance and iso-
thermal titration calorimetry, which provide the afﬁnity of inter-
acting proteins in terms of dissociation constant and binding free
energy change, thereby adding a new dimension to the task of
proteiniprotein interaction network analysis. These experimental
techniques for measuring the proteiniprotein binding afﬁnity
require expensive experimental setup and heavy man power
and are time-consuming. Hence, computational methods have
been developed for predicting the binding afﬁnity that has a
strong potential to help experimental biologists for selecting pro-
teiniprotein complexes of interest with respect to the binding
afﬁnity.

The problem of binding afﬁnity prediction has been addressed
for the past two decades starting with a relatively small dataset of
15 complexes (Horton and Lewis, 1992; Kastritis and Bonvin,
2013). Consequently, various structure-based methods have been
proposed using empirical scoring functions (Audie and Scarlata,
2007; Jiang et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2002), knowledge-based meth-
ods (Moal et a]. 2011; Su et al., 2009; Vreven et al., 2012; Zhang
et al., 2005) and quantitative structureiactivity relationships
(Tian et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013). The main drawback of
these methods is they either considered less number of data or
used improper validation procedures. Kastritis et a]. (2010) set
up a benchmark dataset and discussed the performance of sev-
eral available methods. They reported that the performance of
most of the methods was poor on the benchmark dataset.
Further, Kastritis et a]. (2011) refined the dataset, which contains
the experimental afﬁnity data for a non-redundant set of 144
proteiniprotein complexes along with the information about
their free proteins. This led to the development of few struc-
ture-based methods for proteiniprotein afﬁnity prediction, and
most of them performed well only on the rigid complexes
(Kastritis and Bonvin, 2013). Tian et a]. (2012) developed a
method using 378 features, which caused the possibility of
over-ﬁtting. Hence, it is necessary to develop accurate and reli-
able methods to address the task of predicting proteiniprotein
binding afﬁnity. Recently, we have devised a model based on
machine learning approaches for distinguishing low- and high-
afﬁnity proteiniprotein complexes using sequence-based param-
eters Wugandhar and Gromiha, 2014).

In this work, we have developed a novel approach for predict-
ing the binding afﬁnity of a given proteiniprotein complex from
its amino acid sequence. We have classiﬁed the proteiniprotein
complexes based on their function, molecular weight and per-
centage of binding site residues and analyzed the relationship
between sequence and structural properties of interacting free
proteins and binding afﬁnity. This imparts biological relevance
to the prediction method, as the function of the complex is also
taken into consideration. We have classiﬁed the complexes into
nine groups based on their functions and set up multiple regres-
sion equations for predicting the binding afﬁnity. Our method
showed a correlation range of 0.83%.998 and 073970.992 using
self-consistency and jack-knife test, respectively.

2 METHODS
2.1 Dataset

We have set up a dataset of proteiniprotein complexes based on the
following criteria: (i) both the interacting partners are proteins (sequence
length of minimum 50 amino acids), (ii) the complex is heterodimeric and
(iii) absolute value of binding afﬁnity is known. These criteria yielded a
set of 135 complexes (provided in Supplementary Table S1) from the
afﬁnity benchmark dataset (Kastritis et al., 2011). For all these com-
plexes, we have derived a set of 615 features based on the amino acid
sequence and 640 features based on the structures of two free proteins
forming the complex. Considering the gap between the number of cur-
rently available protein sequences and their solved structures, sequence-
based methods for binding site prediction act as important players in
understanding the binding mechanism and analyzing interaction net-
works. Few methods have been reported for predicting the binding site
residues from amino acid sequence using machine learning techniques,
such as neural networks and support vector machines (Huang et al., 2013;
Ofran and Rost, 2007). For the sequence-based feature calculation, we
have obtained the predicted binding site residues (Ofran and Rost, 2007)
and property values for the 20 amino acids from AAindex database
(Kawashima et al., 2008) and literature (Gromiha, 2005). Similar proced-
ure was followed for calculating the structure-based features, and
SPPIDER server (Porollo and Meller, 2007) was used to predict the
binding site residues from structures of the free proteins. Other struc-
ture-based features include accessible surface area (Hubbard and
Thornton, 1993), number of hydrogen bonds (McDonald and
Thornton, 1994), non-bonded interaction energy (Gromiha et al.,
2009), electrostatic energy and energy due to bond length, bond angle
and torsion angle (Guex and Peitsch, 1997). We noticed that several
properties are related with each other, which cause a bias in the model.
Hence, we have compared the correlation between all possible pairs of
properties and reduced the number of properties so that the correlation
between any of the properties is not >0.65. This process yielded a set of
113 properties (features).

2.2 Classiﬁcation of complexes

Using all the complexes together, we obtained the maximum correlation
of 0.3 between sequence/structure-based features and their experimental
AG values. Hence, for understanding the features inﬂuencing the binding
afﬁnity and improving the prediction efﬁciency, we have classiﬁed the
complexes into different groups based on various criteria such as molecu-
lar weight, function, predicted percentage of binding site residues and
their subgroups (percentage of aromatic and positively charged residues,
hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues). The inspection of results obtained
for all the classiﬁcations by comparing the maximum correlation ob-
tained with single feature and combination of two features showed

that the classiﬁcation based on function is the best one for further
analysis (see Section 3).

The function-based classiﬁcation has been made with seven groups: (i)
antigeniantibody (Ag-Ab) complexes, (ii) enzymeinhibitor (El) com-
plexes, (iii) other enzymes (OE; complexes of enzymes with proteins
other than inhibitors), (iv) G-protein-containing (GC) complexes, (v) re-
ceptor-containing (RC) complexes, (vi) non-cognate (NC) complexes and
(vii) miscellaneous complexes. Further, the miscellaneous complexes have
been subdivided into three different classes based on percentage of pre-
dicted binding site residues in the complex (see section 3.3.7), Viz., mis-
cellaneous I, II and III (54%, 48% and >8% of predicted binding site
residues, respectively). These nine classes cover the entire dataset of
135 proteiniprotein complexes.

2.3 Regression models and validation

We have developed independent regression models for all the nine classes
by combining more than one feature using multiple regression technique
(Grewal, 1987). We have validated the performance of the method using
jack-knife test. In this procedure, regression equations have been de-
veloped with (n71) complexes and used the equation to predict the AG
of the left out complex. This process has been repeated for ‘n’ times
(where n is the total number of complexes in a given class) and computed
the correlation. We have also used support vector regression method
available in WEKA machine learning platform (Hall et al., 2009) to
compare the obtained results.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Signiﬁcance of different classiﬁcations

We have classiﬁed the complexes based on the molecular weights
of free proteins, function and predicted number of binding site
residues, and computed the correlation between binding afﬁnity
and sequence/structure-based properties. The correlation coefﬁ-
cients obtained with proteiniprotein complexes belonging to dif-
ferent subclasses using sequence-based parameters are presented
in Supplementary Table S2. We have repeated the computation
with structure-based features, and the results are presented in
Supplementary Table S3. We observed that the performance
with sequence-based features is marginally better than that
with structure-based features. From Supplementary Table S3,
it is interesting to note that the receptors and ligands, both hav-
ing either high or low molecular weights are dominated by the
properties inﬂuenced by secondary structures (Eathiraj et al.,
2005; Li et al., 1998). Other combination of receptors and ligands
are dominated by interaction energies, such as hydrophobic, elec-
trostatic and hydrogen bonds (Haspel et a]. 2008; Lapouge et al.,
2000; Lu et al., 1999). Further, we examined the performance of
prediction models at different classiﬁcations using their absolute
single-property correlations and the correlation coefﬁcient ob-
tained with the combination of two properties (Table 1). We
found that the classiﬁcation based on protein functions has the
highest absolute single-property correlation of >05 in 86% of
the subclasses, whereas it is 5&83% in other classiﬁcations. In
addition, 57% of the subclasses in protein functions showed the
correlation of >0.8 using the combination of two properties.
Other classiﬁcations showed the maximum correlation of only
33%. Hence, we used the classiﬁcation based on function for
further analysis and to refine the model for predicting the bind-
ing afﬁnity. Further, the subclass, ‘miscellaneous’ has the correl-
ation of <05 for any of the considered features and we grouped

into three categories based on the percentage of binding site
residues at the interface.

3.2 Prediction of binding afﬁnity

The single-property correlation for the proteiniprotein com-
plexes belonging to nine subclasses is presented in Table 2.
Inspection of the results presented in this table revealed that
the absolute correlation is >06 in most of the subclasses and
the correlation is >0.8 for three of them. Further, we have per-
formed a step-wise least square fit using multiple regression tech-
nique for identifying the combinations of features to predict the
binding afﬁnity at high accuracy. For avoiding over-fitting, we
limited the combinations up to 5 from the selected list of 113
properties. The number of properties used in each subclass and
the correlation coefﬁcient with binding afﬁnity is shown in
Table 2. We noticed that the correlation lies in the range of
0.83e0.998 in the subclasses. The P—Value for all the models is

ally signiﬁcant. Further, the models were evaluated with
jack-knife test, and the results are included in Table 2. The com-
bination of features showed the correlation in the range of 0.7397
0.992. The results are comparable with the self-consistency
results, and this suggests that there is no over-ﬁtting in our
models. The relationship between experimental and predicted
AG for all the 135 complexes is shown in Figure 1. We showed
that the binding afﬁnities of 79% of the complexes have been
accurately predicted within a deviation of lkcalmolT1 and 90%
within 2kcalmol’1 from the experimental values.

3.3 Prediction results in different subclasses based
on functions

We have analyzed the performance of the method for predict-
ing the binding afﬁnity in different subclasses of ‘function’, and
the details are discussed below. The regression equations ob-
tained for all the subclasses are given in Supplementary Table

1&14kcalmolT1. The combination of three properties is able to
predict the binding afﬁnity of these complexes to the correlation
of 0.93 and 0.85, respectively, using self-consistency and jack-
knife tests.

Further, the property based on percentage of predicted
charged residues at the interface has been identiﬁed as one of
the important factors. This is supported by the previous studies
that aromatic and charged residues at the proteiniprotein inter-
face play key role in complex formation (Monaco-Malbet et al.,
2000; Pruett and Air, 1998). Moreover, the mutation of charged
residues at the binding sites showed a large reduction in the af-
ﬁnity and is important for the recognition process (Pruett and
Air, 1998). Interestingly, our method could accurately predict the
binding afﬁnity of 94% of the complexes with a deviation of
lkcalmolT1 using jack-knife test.

3.3.2 El complexes The interacting partners in this class of pro-
teiniprotein complexes are enzymes and inhibitors. The binding
free energy of the 31 complexes in this class has the variation of
10kcalmolT1. CDK2—CKSHSl protein complex has the lowest
free energy of 9.7 kcalmol’1 and the complex between Colicin E9
nuclease and Im9 immunity protein has the highest free energy of
18.6 kcal molTl. However, the combination of ﬁve features could
predict the binding free energy with the correlation of 0.836. The
structural analysis of E1 complexes revealed that the binding site
residues and ﬂ-sheet tendency are important for specificity
(Albeck and Schreiber, 1999; Ghosh et al., 2007). Interestingly,
these two features have been selected as important players in
determining the proteiniprotein binding afﬁnity. Our method
could accurately predict the binding free energy for 23 of the
31 complexes within the deviation of 2kcalmol’1 using jack-
knife test.

3.3.3 Other enzymes This class includes complexes formed
by enzymes with proteins other than inhibitors. The
binding free energy of these complexes follows a range of e
13kcalmolT1. The combination of ﬁve properties improved the
correlation up to 0.88 and 0.77, respectively, using self-
consistency and jack-knife tests. These properties include weights
for a-helix (Qian and Sejnowski, 1988) and percentage of
predicted binding site residues. Interestingly, these two
properties are reported to be important for understanding the
recognition mechanism of proteiniprotein complexes
(Chakrabarti and Janin, 2002). The binding free energy for 18
and 13 of these 20 complexes has been accurately predicted
within the deviation of 2 and lkcalmolTl, respectively, using
jack-knife test.

3.3.4 GC complexes G—proteins are an important family of pro-
teins that act as effectors in many signal transduction events.
These proteins work together with G—protein—coupled receptors
(GPCRs) to transmit signals from many hormones, neurotrans-
mitters and other signaling factors (Campbell and Reece, 2002).
The complexes, which have G—proteins as one of the interacting
partners are included in this class, and the average AG is
8.98 kcalmolTl. GC complexes are mainly dominated by hydro-
phobic interactions and secondary structural elements such as
a-helices (Eathiraj et al., 2005; Lapouge et al., 2000). Our regres-
sion model used three properties to predict the binding afﬁnity. It
is noteworthy that the number of predicted hydrophobic residues

at the binding sites and helical propensity (Geisow and Roberts,
1980) was selected in our model. This result demonstrates the
agreement between experimental observations and computa-
tional analysis. A set of 13 among 16 complexes in this class
was predicted with high accuracy, with three outliers, and the
deviation between experimental and predicted binding afﬁnity in
13 complexes is 0.24 kcalmolTl. The binding free energy of 81%
of the complexes was predicted within the deviation of
0.5 kcalmolTl (Fig. 1).

3.3.5 RC complexes This class consists of proteiniprotein com-
plexes having one of the interacting partners that function as
receptor in biological processes. It contains 12 complexes with
an average AG value of 11.58 kcalmolTl. The combination of
three properties including a property based on thermodynamic
nature of the proteins enhanced the correlation up to 0.98. In a
previous study, Maenaka et al. (2001) suggested that the binding
afﬁnities of RC complexes are attributed with thermodynamic
quantities, enthalpy and entropy. This observation supports our
results and reiterates the importance of thermodynamic proper-
ties in governing the binding affinity. Interestingly, the binding
free energies for 92% of the complexes have been accurately
predicted within the deviation of 1.5 kcalmolTl.

3.3.6 NC complexes The concept of cognate and NC proteini
protein complexes arises when two complexes have differ-
ent binding affinity values in spite of having a similar
geometry. In this case, the complex having more afﬁnity is
considered as cognate because in most cases this is the one
having biological relevance than the other (NC) (Kastritis
et al., 2011). Hence, we assumed that the features inﬂuencing
the binding afﬁnity of NC complexes may be different from
their cognate counter parts and included them in this separate
class that consists of nine complexes and the AG values shows a
range of 7713 kcalmolTl. The combination of three properties is
able to predict the binding afﬁnity of these complexes to the
correlation of 0.996 and 0.986, respectively, using self-
consistency and jack-knife tests. Further, features such as weights
for a-helix and the percentage of predicted binding site residues
have been identiﬁed as important factors inﬂuencing the
binding afﬁnity. This is supported by previous studies on NC
complexes that binding site residues at the interface and helical
tendencies could inﬂuence the binding afﬁnity (Erman et al.,
1997; Li et al., 1998). Our method could accurately predict the
binding afﬁnity of all the complexes within the deviation of
0.6kcalmolT1 (Fig. 1).

3.3.7 Miscellaneous complexes The complexes that do not fall
in any of the above six classes are termed as miscellaneous com-
plexes. Generally, the binding site residues are believed to play
important roles in governing the binding afﬁnity. However, the
non-interface residues are also reported to be crucial for speciﬁc
and efﬁcient complex formation (Kiel et al., 2004). Hence, we
considered features accounting for interface information alone
(number of binding site residues) as well as interface residues
normalized with total residues (% of binding site residues). For
three of the six classes, percentage of binding site residues is
selected as one of the best features in our analysis. Hence, we
have further divided the complexes in this class into three sub-
classes based on the percentage of predicted binding site residues.

Protein-protein binding affinity prediction

 

These subclasses have the binding site residues in the ranges of
04% (miscellaneousl, M1), 4e8% (miscellaneous2, M2) and
>8% (miscellaneous3, M3), respectively (Ofran and Rost,
2007). M1 contains 11 complexes, and the binding free energy
of these complexes shows a range of 7714kcalmolT1. Our
method identiﬁed the percentage of aromatic and positively
charged residues, and the number of predicted hydrophobic resi-
dues at the interface as important features to predict the binding
afﬁnity. This result agrees with the previous observations that
aromatic, charged and hydrophobic interactions are important
for the afﬁnity of proteiniprotein complexes (Andersen et al.,
1999). Further, West et al. (2001) reported that four of the ﬁve
substitutions that resulted in signiﬁcant reduction in binding af-
ﬁnity were of aromatic/charged residues, suggesting their import-
ance in proteiniprotein interactions. The combination of three
properties raised the correlation up to 0.99, and the deviation is
0.186kcalmolT1. M2 consists of 10 complexes and the average
AG is 9.1 kcalmolTl. The combination of three properties includ-
ing the weights to ﬂ-sheet enhanced the correlation up to 0.98. In
an earlier work, Bonsor et al. (2007) suggested the importance of
ﬂ-sheet at the interface of a proteiniprotein complex.
Interestingly, this feature was shown to be crucial for discrimi-
nating proteiniprotein complexes with respect to their binding
afﬁnities Wugandhar and Gromiha, 2014). The binding afﬁnities
of all the complexes have been predicted within the deivation of
0.8 kcalmolTl. M3 includes 11 complexes, which have more
number of binding site residues, and the AG of these complexes
shows a range of 4el2kcalmolT1. Our method could identify a
property related to electrostatic interactions (Charton and
Charton, 1983) as an inﬂuencing factor, and this observation
in accordance with the report by Haspel et al. (2008) that elec-
trostatic interactions could be driving force in proteiniprotein
complex formation and binding properties are inﬂuenced by elec-
trostatic changes. Binding free energy for all the miscellaneous
complexes could be predicted with a deviation of 0.85 kcalmol’1
using jack-knife test by our method. Further, we have analyzed
the features inﬂuencing the binding afﬁnity of ordered and dis-
ordered proteiniprotein complexes. Of the 32 complexes in this
class, 23 have at least one of the interacting proteins in dis-
ordered state. We performed least square fit for the disordered
and ordered set of complexes separately to identify the features
inﬂuencing binding afﬁnity. Interestingly, percentage of pre-
dicted binding site residues and net charge of the protein are
selected as the best features for disordered and ordered sets, re-
spectively. These features have also been identiﬁed for discrimi-
nating high- and low-afﬁnity proteiniprotein complexes
Wugandhar and Gromiha, 2014), and this result shows the im-
portance of electrostatic interactions in ordered complexes
(Sheinerman and Honig, 2002).

3.4 Afﬁnity prediction for homodimeric complexes

As the principles governing the binding mechanism and speciﬁ-
city for homodimeric complexes differ from that of heterodimeric
complexes, we developed a separate model for homodimeric
complexes using the available afﬁnity data for 23 complexes
(Luo et al., 2014). A combination of six features yielded a cor-
relation of 0.914 and 0.827 using self-consistency and jack-knife
test, respectively. The selected features account for the

importance of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions at the
interface (Bahadur et al., 2003).

3.5 Analysis on importance of binding site residues of
protein—protein complexes

As reported in Section 3, the percentage of predicted binding site
residues was selected as one of the features in three classes, Viz.,
EI, OE and NC through feature selection process. Further, the
classiﬁcation based on binding site residues improved the correl-
ation in the subclass of miscellaneous proteiniprotein complexes.
These observations emphasize the importance of binding site
residues along with the role of charged residues for understand-
ing the binding speciﬁcity of proteiniprotein complexes. We il-
lustrate their importance with speciﬁc examples from each class
mentioned above [CDK2—CKSHSl (lBUH) and Trypsin—BPTI
(2PTC) complexes (AG: 9.7 and 18.04kcalmolT1, respectively)
from E1, Glycerol kinaseiGlucose-speciﬁc protein IIIGlc
(lGLA) and Von Willebrand factor-Botrocetin (IIJK) (AG: 6.8
and 10.4 kcal molTl, respectively) from OE class and Cytochrome
C peroxidase-Cytochrome C (2PCB) and RNase SA-Barstar
(1AY7) complexes (AG: 6.8 and 13.2 kcalmolTl, respectively)
from NC]. The binding site residues have been identiﬁed from
the complex structures available in Protein Data Bank (Rose
et al. 2013) using PDBsum (Laskowski, 2009) and related with
AG values. We have also predicted the binding site residues using
amino acid sequence (Ofran and Rost, 2007), which shows a
similar trend to those obtained with structural data.

In all the three examples, we found that the strong binding
proteiniprotein complexes have higher percentage of residues in
the binding sites compared with those of weak binding com-
plexes. This implies the signiﬁcance of binding site residues in
governing binding speciﬁcity and afﬁnity. Our results support
the previous reports in the literature suggesting the importance
of binding site residues in proteiniprotein complexes
(Chakrabarti and Janin, 2002). Further, it has been reported
that interface hydrogen bonds might contribute to the stability
of proteiniprotein complexes and hence are important in pro-
teiniprotein interactions (Sheinerman et al., 2000). Among the
six complexes, hydrogen bonds formed in four complexes at the
interface have at least one charged residue as the donor or ac-
ceptor, and the remaining two complexes 2PTC and 1AY7 have
78.57 and 81.82% of their interface hydrogen bonds formed by
the involvement of charged residues. Interestingly, there is no salt
bridge formed at the interface in all these six complexes. This
observation reiterates the importance of charged residues in
binding sites and their role as anchor residues in the binding
pockets of proteiniprotein complexes mainly by forming inter
molecular hydrogen bonds apart from salt bridges (Arkin and
Wells, 2004; Rajamani et al., 2004; Sheinerman et al., 2000;
Stites, 1997). The comparison of interface residues for two com-
plexes having different binding free energies are shown in
Supplementary Figure SI and it reveals that the complex
having higher percentage of binding site residues
(Supplementary Figure Sla) has the higher binding free energy
than the other one with lower percentage of binding site residues
(Supplementary Figure Slb). The charged residues at the binding
sites that are known to be playing key role especially by forming

3.6 Comparison of multiple regression and SVM-based
regression methods

We have compared the results obtained in the present study
using multiple regression technique with support vector regres-
sion, and the details are given in Supplementary Table SS. We
observed that the performance of the present method is better
than or similar to that obtained with support vector regression in
most of the classes. Further, the average correlation is 0.91 and
0.88, respectively, for multiple regression and support vector re-
gression. The average MAE for these models is 0.52 and 0.60.
This shows the better performance of the present method than
support vector regression.

3.7 Comparison with previous methods

The present work is the ﬁrst sequence-based method for predict-
ing the binding afﬁnity of proteiniprotein complexes. Hence, it is
not appropriate to compare with other existing structure-based
methods. However, the comparison of features and performance
provides additional information for using different methods. The
available structure-based methods used 37378 features for pre-
dicting the binding afﬁnity (Audie and Scarlata, 2007; Horton
and Lewis, 1992; Jiang et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2002; Moal et al.
2011; Su et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2012; Vreven et al., 2012; Zhang
et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2013). The main shortcomings of these
methods are (i) the requirement of structural information, (ii)
usage of relatively small number of data, (iii) good performance
only on rigid complexes and (iv) possibility of over-ﬁtting
(Kastritis and Bonvin, 2013). On the other hand, in our previous
work we have developed a machine learning-based model for
discriminating proteiniprotein complexes in terms of their bind-
ing afﬁnity, and it was a two-state classiﬁcation problem
Wugandhar and Gromiha, 2014). The present method has sev-
eral advantages such as (i) no structural information is required,
(ii) we classiﬁed the complexes based on function, that imparts
biological relevance to this method, (iii) properly validated using
jack-knife test. Nevertheless, there are certain limitations in our
method such as (i) being a sequence-based method, it cannot be
used to check the binding afﬁnity of different binding poses of a
single protein pair, (ii) the method is based on a relatively small
dataset and (iii) classiﬁcation has been done on a broader level of
functions. In future, when new experimental data for proteini
protein binding afﬁnity get accumulated, the method can be
reﬁned and/or make additional sub-classiﬁcations to increase
its reliability.

Further, we have compared the performance of our method
(PPA-Pred) with other structure-based methods, Viz., DFIRE
(Liu et al., 2004), PMF (Su et al., 2009) and consensus approach
(Moal et al., 2011) using a dataset of 137 complexes along with
its subsets with ﬂexible and rigid complexes [Complexes with
interface RMSD (ca atom) <1A are considered as rigid and
the remaining as ﬂexible]. Our method showed better perform-
ance than all of them, and it could predict efﬁciently for both
rigid as well as ﬂexible complexes (Fig. 2). The improvement of
correlation using our method is 0.25, 0.44 and 0.32 in rigid, ﬂex-
ible and all complexes, respectively.

3.8 Prediction on the Web

We have developed a Web server named ‘Protein—Protein
Afﬁnity Predictor (PPA-Pred)’ for predicting the binding afﬁnity
of proteiniprotein complexes from amino acid sequence. It takes
the functional information and amino acid sequence in FASTA
format as input. The output includes the predicted value of bind-
ing afﬁnity, AG and Kd. The Kd value is derived using the fol-
lowing equation.

ln Kd — ﬁ (1)
In the above equation, AG is the dissociation free energy, Kd
is the dissociation constant, R is the gas constant
(1.987 x 10’3 kcalmol’1 KTI), and T is the temperature (assumed
to be room temperature i.e. 25O C). The Web server is freely ac-
cessible at http://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/PPA_Pred/.

4 CONCLUSION

We have developed the first sequence-based method for predict-
ing the binding afﬁnity of proteiniprotein complexes using a
robust methodology based on the functional classiﬁcation. We
obtained a mean correlation and MAE of 0.91 and 0.52, respect-
ively, using jack-knife test. Further, we have systematically ana-
lyzed the importance of selected features in each class and related
with experimental observations. It is evident that the percentage
of binding site residues plays an important role in governing
proteiniprotein binding afﬁnity. We suggest that our method
(PPA-Pred) could be used as an efﬁcient tool for proteiniprotein
interaction network analysis for specific diseases.

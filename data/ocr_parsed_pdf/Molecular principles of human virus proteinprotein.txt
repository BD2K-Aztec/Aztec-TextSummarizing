Abstract

Motivation: Viruses, from the human protein—protein interaction network perspective, target hubs,
bottlenecks and interconnected nodes enriched in certain biological pathways. However, not much
is known about the general characteristic features of the human proteins interacting with viral
proteins (referred to as hVIPs) as well as the motifs and domains utilized by human—virus protein——
protein interactions (referred to as Hu—Vir PPIs).

Results: Our study has revealed that hVIPs are mostly disordered proteins, whereas viral proteins
are mostly ordered proteins. Protein disorder in viral proteins and hVIPs varies from one subcellular
location to another. In any given viral—human PPI pair, at least one of the two proteins is structurally
disordered suggesting that disorder associated conformational flexibility as one ofthe characteristic
features of virus—host interaction. Further analyses reveal that hVIPs are (i) slowly evolving proteins,
(ii) associated with high centrality scores in human—PPI network, (iii) involved in multiple pathways,
(iv) enriched in eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) associated with protein modification, degradation and
regulatory processes, (v) associated with high number of splice variants and (vi) expressed abun—
dantly across multiple tissues. These aforementioned findings suggest that conformational flexibility,
spatial diversity, abundance and slow evolution are the characteristic features ofthe human proteins
targeted by viral proteins. Hu—Vir PPIs are mostly mediated via domain—motif interactions (DMls)
where viral proteins employ motifs that mimic host ELMs to bind to domains in human proteins.
DMIs are shared among viruses belonging to different families indicating a possible convergent evo—
lution of these motifs to help viruses to adopt common strategies to subvert host cellular pathways.

1 Introduction

Viruses are the obligate intracellular parasites and hence need host
cellular machinery for their genome replication and propagation
enabled by interactions between viral and several host proteins
during various stages of viral infection. Hence, viral-host protein—-
protein interactions have been keenly studied by employing both

computational (Dyer et (11., 2008; Meyniel—Schicklin et (11., 2012;
Navratil et (11., 2011; Wuchty et (11., 2010) and experimental
(Calderwood et (11., 2007; de Chassey et (11., 2008; Jager et (11., 2012;

Human protein—protein interaction (Hu—PPI) network is robust to
random attacks owing to its scale—free nature (Barabasi, 1999); how—
ever, the network breaks down due to targeted attacks (Albert et al.,
2000). Studies have shown that viral proteins interact with hubs,
bottlenecks and rich clubs in Hu—PPI network, and they also interact
with the human proteins involved in signalling, cell cycle regulation,
cell trafficking, transcription and translation (Calderwood et al., 2007;
de Chassey et al., 2008; Dyer et al., 2008; Navratil et al., 2011; Uetz
et al., 2006; Wuchty et al., 2010). The fact that viral proteins, although
very a few in number, target hubs, bottlenecks and rich clubs indicates
that viral subversion of human cellular processes is achieved by tar—
geted attacks (Meyniel—Schicklin et al., 2012). Our recent study has re—
vealed yet another interesting facet of viral proteins that some of them
act as articulation points in the human—viral—bridged PPI network by
bridging unconnected components of Hu—PPI network, thereby media—
ting certain novel interactions to tune host machinery for their propa—
gation (Halehalli and Nagarajaram, 2014).

In literature, one can find studies reporting properties of host
proteins targeted by viral proteins. For example, it has been reported
that the human proteins targeted by viruses are associated with dia—
betes and auto immune diseases (Navratil et al., 2011). Viral im—
mune modulators have been shown to target proteins involved in
signalling pathways and cellular processes (Pichlmair et al., 2012). It
has been found that the targets of HIV—1 are highly conserved across
primates (Jager et al., 2012).

Structural interaction network studies comprising about 50
viral—Hu—PPIs (Franzosa and Xia, 2011) have revealed that the en—
dogenous interfaces (Hu—PPI) evolve at slower rates compared with
rest of the surface, whereas the exogenous interfaces (viral targets)
evolve at faster rates (Franzosa and Xia, 2011). Later studies based
on another dataset comprising 954 interactions reported results
(Franzosa et al., 2012) contradicted these results.

Among proteins, some are referred to as intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs) as these proteins are enriched with disordered re—
gions lacking stable three—dimensional structures. IDPs are known
to perform many biological functions such as signalling, regulatory
processes, DNA binding and transcription (Babu et al., 2011; Dyson
and Wright, 2005; Tompa, 2002, 2009; Uversky and Dunker,
2010). IDPs usually interact with large number of proteins and
hence occupy topologically important positions in protein—protein
interaction networks (Dosztanyi et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008).
They are tightly regulated (Gsponer et al., 2008) in the cell and
found to harbour short linear motifs [SLiMs/eukaryotic linear motifs
(ELMs)] in their disordered regions that are recognized by modular
protein domains such as SH3, PDZ and SH2 (Diella et al., 2008;
Nguyen Ba et al., 2012).

Many genomes, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, harbour several
genes that code for IDPs (Ward et al., 2004a) (about 2.0% in archaea,
4.2% in bacteria and 33.0% in eukaryotes). Viral genomes too code
for IDPs, and the proportion of amino acids in the disordered regions
of these genomes vary from 1% to 70% depending on their hosts or
genome types (Pushker et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2012). Furthermore,
some of the viruses harbour sequences that mimic ELMs in the dis—
ordered regions (Davey et al., 2011; Diella et al., 2008).

Some of the IDPs are associated with certain human genetic dis—
orders, cancers, neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases (Babu
et al., 2011; Midic et al., 2009; Uversky et al., 2008). However, role
of IDPs in infectious diseases, in particular those caused by viral in—
fections, has not been well studied.

In this study, we report a systematic analysis of characteristic
features of human proteins interacting with viral proteins (hVIPs) as
well as on general features of human—virus (Hu—Vir) PPI. We find

that significant number of hVIPs can be classified as IDPs.
Furthermore, hVIPs occupy central positions in PPI network; evolve
at relatively slower rates; involve in multiple pathways, harbour a
number of potential binding interfaces and linear motifs in their dis—
ordered regions. We also find that virus—Hu—PPIs are mediated by a
common set of domain—motif interactions (DMIs).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Interaction data

2.1.1 Hu-Vir PPI data

The dataset used in this study is same as the one used in our previous
study (Halehalli and Nagarajaram, 2014). For the sake of continu—
ity, we give some essential details of this dataset. The dataset com—
prises curated human and virus protein interaction data, which were
obtained from the publically available, literature—curated databases
VirusMINT (Chatr—aryamontri et al., 2009) and PIG (Driscoll et al.,
2009). In addition, interactions predicted from yeast two—hybrid
studies of human proteins with Vaccinia virus (Zhang et al., 2009),
Dengue virus (Khadka et al., 2011), HTLV—1 and HTLV—2 (Simonis
et al., 2012) were also added (further details are given in
Supplementary Material).

2.1.2 Hu-PPI data

Union of PPIs in HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) and IntAct
(Aranda et al., 2010) was used as a representative dataset of binary
Hu—PPIs for studies reported here. The data consist of 49 772 inter—
actions involving 10 446 proteins. Of the proteins in this dataset,
8887 are not represented in the Hu—Vir protein—protein interaction
(Hu—Vir PPI) dataset and therefore, they are referred to as ‘non—
hVIPs” for the purpose of comparative analysis with hVIPs.

2.2 Disorder and subcellular localization prediction

2.2.1 Prediction of intrinsic disorder in proteins

Structural disorder in human proteins was predicted using
DISOPRED2 (Ward et al., 2004b) with a false—positive rate of up to
2.0, and the protein sequences used for predictions correspond to
the reviewed canonical forms represented in UniProt/SwissProt
(version 116) (preiler et al., 2004). In literature, a protein is said
to be disordered depending on the length of disordered region
(Ward et al., 2004a) or percentage of disordered residues (Gsponer
et al., 2008) in that protein. In this study, a protein is considered as
disordered (IDP) if it has >30% of its residues in the predicted dis—
ordered regions; ordered protein (ODP) if it has 310% of its resi—
dues in disordered regions and moderately disordered protein
(MDP) if it has 10—30% of its residues in disordered regions. While
performing x2 tests, we have used the expected numbers of IDPs,
MDPs and ODPs calculated from their % in UniProt/SwissProt.

2.2.2 Subcellular localization of human proteins and localization
entropy

Subcellular localization was predicted using localization prediction
tool WoLF PSORT (Horton et al., 2007). Localization entropy (LE,
Snel et al., 2002) of a hVIP was calculated using the following
formula:

T), T),
LE 2 —Z Tlog

PI4K3 kinase activation (Berger et al., 2011) consistent with our find—
ing inositol phosphate metabolism being targeted by means of DMIs.
Our previous study on Hu—Vir—bridged networks has revealed certain
viral proteins acting as articulation points and as a consequence bridge
metabolic pathways to the signalling pathways. Aforementioned obser—
vations and examples in a nutshell support that host—like linear motifs
in viral protein sequences are used for modulation of host functions by
viruses.

Although the known protein disorder in the viral genomes vary
broadly in the range from 1 to 70%, majority of them are in the
range of 10—30% (Pushker et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2012). Our study
has also shown that majority of viral proteins are ODPs and MDPs
structured (% of disordered residues <30%). Disordered viral pro—
teins (Meyniel-Schicklin et al., 2012) show high—degree centrality.
Though viral disordered proteins are less in number, we see that
they interact with higher number of hVIPs owing to their disorder
and higher number of ELMs. Some viral proteins have shown to
contain higher density of ELMs (Garamszegi et al., 2013). Few stud—
ies focusing presence of ELMs in disordered proteins of HCV (Fan
et al., 2014) and across viral genomes (Hagai et al., 2014) have been
reported. There are large numbers of uncharacterized ELMs in dis—
ordered regions of viral proteins, which may have functional impli—
cations (Hagai et al., 2014; Tompa et al., 2014). In our study, we
see viruses utilizing ELMs as a common strategy to manipulate cer—
tain pathways. Presence of large numbers of putative ELMs indicate
that viruses may use molecular mimicry of ELMs as a strategy to re—
wire host’s regulatory and signalling pathways. Current approaches
based on limited structural data are inadequate to uncover all the
ELMs involved in Hu—Vir PPIs.

5 Conclusion

Our study has shed light on general molecular characteristics of tar—
geted viral attack on host cells. Viruses have evolved in such a way
that they employ targeted attack strategy by interacting with import—
ant proteins of Hu—PPI network, which are mostly IDPs. In most of
the cases, Hu—Vir PPIs commonly involve at least one IDP providing
conformational flexibility to the protein interaction. Viruses were
found to utilize intrinsic disorder in human proteins and of viral pro—
teins differentially in different subcellular locations. Interactions
with central proteins enable viruses to take control of host network
and redirect it towards synthesis of viral genome and proteins.
hVIPs were found to be enriched with binding interfaces in dis—
ordered region and SLiMs/ELMs in them. Viruses mimic host motifs
and utilize them for targeted attack on certain host cellular path—
ways. Presence of motifs which act as molecular switches in regula—
tion of multiple pathways, high connectivity and global expression,
involvement in multiple pathways, slow evolutionary rate, protein
abundance and high LE in human proteins makes them Achilles”
heel for targeted attack by viral proteins. Viruses irrespective of their
families mimic linear motifs in their protein sequences as a common
strategy to subvert specified functions undergoing convergent evolu—
tion. Information control, functional diversity, protein abundance,
evolutionary plasticity of viruses to mimic host ELMs and conform—
ational flexibility are the governing principles of Hu—Vir PPIs. This
knowledge can be further exploited for screening and developing
broad spectrum of antiviral therapies.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Phybase is an R package for phylogenetic analysis
using species trees. It provides functions to read, write, manipulate,
simulate, estimate, summarize and plot species trees, which contain
not only the topology and branch lengths but also population sizes.
Availability: The Phybase package is available at the R repository.
The manual and supporting materials including source code, sample
R code and sample data files for the species tree analysis are
available at http://stat.osu.edu/~|iu|iang/research/phybase.htm|

1 INTRODUCTION

Species trees are the fundamental tools in studying biodiversity and
evolutionary history. It has been appreciated that phylogenies of
genes (gene trees) are distinct from phylogenies of species (species
trees) (Doyle, 1992; Edwards, 2009; Maddison, 1997; Maddison
and Knowles, 2006). However, most phylogenetic programs are
designed for estimation of gene trees and lack functions to perform
species tree analysis. As an example, when species trees are recorded
as modiﬁed Newick ﬁles, the population size parameter (6) in
the species tree is not readable by most phylogenetic programs
including PAUP (Swofford, 2003), PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 2005)
and MrBayes (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist and
Huelsenbeck, 2003), making it difﬁcult to summarize species trees in
these phylogenetic programs. It is desirable to have a phylogenetic
program that can provide functions necessary for the analysis of
species trees. Phybase is an R package designed speciﬁcally for
species tree analysis, although it is also capable of analyzing gene
trees. It provides functions to read, write, manipulate, simulate,
estimate and summarize species trees.

The input/output functions in the package can read and write DNA
sequences and phylogenetic trees (gene trees and species trees) in
the Newick format. Phylogenetic trees are read in as a string and then
transformed to a matrix, which describes the ancestral relationships
of nodes and branch lengths. The nodes matrix provides an easy
access for developers to ﬁirther manipulate the tree, while the tree
string provides a useful interface to other phylogenetic packages in
R such as the package APE (Paradis et al., 2004). Basic ﬁinctions are
available in the package to manipulate phylogenetic trees including
deleting and swapping nodes, rooting and unrooting trees. Phybase
includes functions to summarize collections of species trees such as
those that arise from bootstrap analysis or the posterior distribution

in Bayesian analysis of species trees (Liu et (11., 2008). Phybase is
able to simulate DNA sequences from a prespeciﬁed species tree.
Gene trees can be generated from a species tree under the coalescent
model (Rannala and Yang, 2003), which assumes a molecular clock
for gene trees and the species tree. Alternatively, gene trees can be
generated from a non-clock-like species tree which allows variable
mutation rates along the branches (populations) in the species tree
(Mossel and Roch, 2007). The variable mutation rate is most likely
due to changes in generation time as well as changes to the overall
rate of mutation along the branches (populations) in the species
tree. Phybase has ﬁinctions to generate DNA sequences from gene
trees under a variety of substitution models (Felsenstein, 2004). The
species tree can be simulated from another phylogenetic package
PhySim in R.

2 A PHYBASE APPLICATION: COMPARING THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE STAR METHOD WITH
CONCATENATION IN ESTIMATING SPECIES
TREES

As an example of the utility of Phybase, we used Phybase to simulate
DNA sequences from a S-taxon species tree (Fig. 1). For simplicity,
we assume a constant population size across all populations in the
species tree. The population size and branch lengths in the species
tree are in mutation units. The population size is set to be 0.001,
0.003, 0.005 and 0.007 to investigate the effect of the population size
on the performance of STAR (Liu et al., 2009) and concatenation
(Huelsenbeck et (11., 1996) in estimating species trees. We generated
10 gene trees from the species tree (an allele per species) under
the coalescent model (Rannala and Yang, 2003). DNA sequences of

500 bp were generated from the 10 gene trees with the HKY model
(Hasegawa et (11., 1985). The simulated DNA sequences were then
treated as data to estimate the species tree using the concatenation
and STAR methods. Phybase does not have functions to calculate
maximum likelihood (ML) gene trees. For the STAR method, we
used the phylogenetics program PhyML (Guindon and Gascuel,
2003) to estimate ML gene trees without a molecular clock. We
do not need to estimate coalescence times in gene trees, because
STAR estimates species trees on the basis of the ranks of coalescence
times. The simulation was repeated 1000 times. The performance
of STAR or concatenation is measured by the proportion of trials
yielding the true species tree. According to coalescent theory, the
proportion of gene trees matching the species tree decreases as the
population size increases. Higher proportion of gene trees matching
the species tree implies that it is easier to recover the true species
tree. Thus, we expect that the proportion of trials yielding the true
species tree for both methods will increase as the population size
decreases. The results of the simulation agree with our expectation,
showing that both methods perform better as the population size
decreases (Fig. 1). In addition, the results indicate that concatenation
outperforms STAR at the population sizes 0.001 and 0.003, while
STAR outperforms concatenation at the population sizes 0.005 and
0.007. For the population size 0.007, 110 and 160 genes are required,
respectively, for STAR and concatenation to successfully recover
the true species tree for all trials. Since the concatenation method
assumes concordant gene trees, it may perform poorly for the cases
when the concordant gene trees assumption is seriously violated
(Kubatko and Degnan, 2007). This explains the poor performance
of concatenation when the population size is equal to 0.005 and
0.007, and the corresponding proportions of concordant gene trees
are 0.124 and 0.089. In contrast, concatenation performs well when
the population size is 0.001 and the corresponding proportion of
concordant gene trees is 0.717. This simulation study suggests that
the concatenation method for estimating species trees is suitable
for the cases when the majority of gene trees are similar to each
other, although we expect the conﬁdence in the tree generated by
concatenation to be inﬂated nonetheless (Liu et al., 2008). If the data
indicate highly incongruent gene trees, the STAR method may be
more appropriate than concatenation for the species tree estimation.

3 CONCLUSION

Phybase is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
As an R package, Phybase inherits the open source nature of R.

We invite others to continue to contribute phylogenetics inference
packages in the R framework.

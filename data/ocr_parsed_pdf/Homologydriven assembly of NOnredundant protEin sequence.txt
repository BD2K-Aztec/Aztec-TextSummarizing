Abstract

Summary: To enable mass spectrometry (MS)—based proteomic studies with poorly characterized
organisms, we developed a computational workflow for the homology—driven assembly of a non—
redundant reference sequence dataset. In the automated pipeline, translated DNA sequences (e.g.
ESTs, RNA deep—sequencing data) are aligned to those of a closely related and fully sequenced organ—
ism. Representative sequences are derived from each cluster and joined, resulting in a non—redundant
reference set representing the maximal available amino acid sequence information for each protein.
We here applied NOmESS to assemble a reference database for the widely used model organism
Xenopus laevis and demonstrate its use in proteomic applications.

Availability and implementation: NOmESS is written in C#. The source code as well as the executables
can be downloaded from http://www.biochem.mpg.de/cox. Execution of NOmESS requires BLASTp and

cd—hit in addition.

1 Introduction

Within the shotgun proteomics workﬂow, identiﬁcation and quantifi—
cation of proteins relies on comprehensive databases, which are used
to calculate theoretical peptide spectra that can be searched against
the experimentally determined MS/MS spectra. Therefore, the data—
base should ideally represent the amino acid sequences of all the ex—
pressed proteins of the biological system. This information can be
deduced from the sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as
well as from RNA deep—sequencing experiments. These short reads
are assembled into larger contigs using genomic sequence information
of the same organism as a scaffold. However, for many organisms an
accurately assembled genomic sequence is still lacking, leaving investi—
gators vvith large and redundant sequence repositories that are im—
practical and of limited use for proteomic studies.

To overcome these limitations, we developed NOmESS, an auto—
mated pipeline for the assembly of available sequence information

(e.g. ESTs, Contigs, RNAseq, exome sequencing data etc.) into a
non—redundant reference dataset based on homology to a closely
related species (Fig. 1). As a test organism, we chose Xenopus
laevis, which represents a widely used model organism for develop—
mental and cell cycle studies. Because X.laevis underwent allotetra—
ploidization (Hughes and Hughes, 1993), sequencing efforts have
been focused predominantly on its diploid cousin X.tropicalis,
whose complete genome sequence was published in 2010. However,
many experiments can only be carried out with X.laevis due to its
larger size and the availability of species—specific reagents. Using
X.tropicalis as a scaffold, NOmESS was able to consolidate se—
quence information from various repositories (e.g. Xenbase,
Karpinka et (11., 2015), Uniprot, TIGR) into a single non—redundant
FASTA file containing about 13 500 protein sequences, which in
most cases cover the entire open reading frame of the corresponding
X. tropicalis homolog.

2 Methods

The NOmESS executable and all used sequence sets can be down—
loaded from http://www.bi0chem.mpg.ddc0x. It requires local installa—
tion of BLASTp and cd—hit (Li and Godzik, 2006). A graphical user
interface (GUI) (Supplementary Fig. S1) facilitates the uploading of in—
put and scaffold sequences, as well as the setting of all internal param—
eters. A detailed description of the parameters and their default values
is provided in Supplementary Figure S1. FASTA files containing amino
acid sequences for both input and scaffold data can be generated with
ORF—Predictor (Min et al., 2005). It is recommended to remove redun—
dant entries from the scaffold sequence set by using the implemented
cd—hit algorithm using an identity threshold of 0.95, which can be
defined in the GUI.

3 Results and discussion

The basic steps of NOmESS are shown in Figure 1. It starts with an
optional pre-processing step, in which input sequences are cut before
and after non—amino acid characters (e.g. ‘X’ or ""’) and a non—re—
dundant set of fragments with a minimal length of at least 100
amino acids are kept for the assembly process.

In the assembly step, input fragments are assigned to the best fit—
ting scaffold sequence. To this end, input sequences are blasted
against the scaffold sequences and the BLAST hits are filtered by user—
defined criteria (see Supplementary Fig. S1 ‘Homology thresholds
BLASTp’ tab for default parameters). Fragments corresponding to a
scaffold sequence are sorted into a ranking list according to their rela—
tive starting position, fragment length and sequence conservation (see
Supplementary Fig. S2A and B for details). Starting from the N—
terminus, overlapping fragments are identified by matching the end of

the first fragment to the subsequent fragment. Only if 9 of the 10 ter—
minal amino acids are identical and if the rest of the overlapping
region between the fragments shares at least 97% identity, the C—
terminal extension of the second fragment is transferred to the preced—
ing sequence. If this is not the case, the sequence is added at the end
of the ranking list. In the rare case that a scaffold sequence is repre—
sented by two homologs in the query species, this procedure allows to
independently assemble these homologs in a consecutive fashion.
Next, redundant sequences are removed from the assembled contigs
with cd—hit using an identity threshold of 0.95. In the concatenation
step, non—overlapping contigs belonging to the same scaffold sequence
are fused. To this end, the assembled contigs are realigned to the best—
fitting scaffold sequence and sorted by relative position, length and se—
quence conservation (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Non—overlapping
contigs belonging to the same scaffold are then concatenated with a
letter ‘X’ separating the two segments to symbolize insertions or dele—
tions. As before, redundant sequences are removed from the con—
catenated contigs with cd—hit using an identity threshold of 0.95. In
the representative selection step, the concatenated sequences are
blasted against the scaffold sequences and the longest sequence of
each cluster is retained to represent the scaffold sequence in the final
database. If two sequences have the same length, the BLAST hit with
the higher bit score is taken.

NOmESS was developed with the clear intention to facilitate
quantitative mass spectrometry based experiments. The goal was to
generate a non—redundant reference set, in which each protein is rep—
resented by the longest possible amino acid sequence. While the gen—
eric approach allows combining heterogeneous data from various
sources (e.g. tissues, developmental stages, individuals), concaten—
ation of fragments belonging to different isoforms or allelic variants
may result in erroneous hybrid sequences. However, such hybrids
may be efficiently removed, as all sequences are filtered stringently
after each step for their homology to the scaffold. More importantly,
protein intensities are calculated based on the intensity of observed
peptides only. Thus, sequence insertion corresponding to an isoform
expressed in another tissue than the one analyzed will not affect
quantitation of the remaining part of the protein. These occasional
draw—backs are outweighed by a general gain in sequence coverage
and improved annotation due to the net gain in sequence length.

To demonstrate the usefulness of NOmESS, we used amino acid se—
quences of X.tropicalis as a scaffold to assemble X.laevis sequences
into a non—redundant reference dataset (Supplementary Fig. S3). We
next processed a small MS dataset recorded from fractionated X.laevis
egg extracts with NOmESS output files generated after different steps
of the assembly process. Using these files significantly higher numbers
of peptides or ‘protein groups’ were identified compared to identical
searches using the latest release from UniProt (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Only after the final optional step 4 (‘Representative selection’), the
identification rate dropped slightly below the one obtained with the
UniProt database. These results suggest that the final step, during
which all isoforms are discarded, may be too stringent for discovery—
driven projects. However, for more global, pathway—centred analyses,
it may greatly facilitate downstream bioinformatic analyses as demon—
strated in recent work, in which a NOmESS—generated database has
been successfully used to identify X.laevis proteins specifically recruited
to stalled DNA replication forks (Raschle et al., 2015).

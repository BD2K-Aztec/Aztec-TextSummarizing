ABSTRACT

Summary: The flexibility of a-helices is important for membrane
protein function and calls for better visualization and analysis.
Software is presented that quantifies and projects the helix axis
evolution over time, with the choice of uniform or analytic heatmap
graphics according to the local geometry. Bendix supports static,
molecular dynamics, atomistic and coarse-grained input.
Availability and implementation: Bendix source code and
documentation, including installation instructions, are freely available
at http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/Bendix. Bendix is written in Tcl as an
extension to VMD and is supported by all major operating systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

a-Helix ﬂexibility enables membrane protein functionality such as
receptor activation, molecule transport and channel gating (Sansom
and Weinstein, 2000). Examples of this can be seen in the voltage-
gated potassium channels and the MscS mechanosensitive channel,
where molecular hinges within channel-lining helices elicit gating
(Akitake et (11., 2007; J iang et (11., 2002). In addition, helix curvature
ensures structural integrity by allowing close packing (Ceruso and
Weinstein, 2002).

The dynamics of transmembrane at-helices can be explored
through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which is becoming
an increasingly important tool to complement experimental
structural studies (Stansfeld and Sansom, 2011). However, improved
methods for analysis and visualization of helix dynamics are
needed. Considerations of helix ﬂexibility are also somewhat
compromised by their classical representation as idealized cylinders.
The prevalence and importance of kinked helices therefore calls for
improved helix abstraction and intuitive analysis tools. Furthermore,
it is important to make such developments available to the
wider community by incorporation into existing, publicly adopted
visualization software (Goddard and Ferrin, 2007). We have
therefore developed Bendix, a program that meets these demands.

2 PROGRAM FEATURES

Bendix features custom helix representation and geometry indicative
graphics that assist analysis of both static structures and complex
molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. Bendix uses a sliding
window of four residues to give local helix axes that are joined by
a spline (Dalton et (11., 2003).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The example provided in Figure l for the membrane protein
Mhpl shows how Bendix can be used to reveal the role of helix
ﬂexibility in a complex transport mechanism (Shimamura et (11.,
2010). The graphed helix axis captures crucial conformational
information that is lost in classical, straight cylinders, besides
offering a concise alternative to the spiraling ribbon backbone.
Analysis is performed on this axis to give local angles along the
length of the helix versus time. This helix distortion distribution is
visualized across residues by heatmap colour-coding according to
local angle magnitude, which highlights non-linear helix behaviour.
In the example of Mhpl, this feature exposes important changes in
helix TM10 as Mhpl adopts its different functional and structural
states (Fig. lA—C). 2D and 3D graphs of the evolution of maximal
and local angles over time are provided (Fig. 1D and E), with the
choice to export data to other software. In particular, Bendix enables
ready comparison of helix distortions in multiple X-ray structures
with those observed in MD simulations.

Bendix comes with a user-friendly graphical user interface
with customizable settings, e.g. resolution, helix diameter, angle
side length, helix assignment and choice of uniform or angle-
indicative graphics. A full list of features, technical detail,
examples and tutorials are provided at http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.
uk/Bendix. Bendix is platform-independent and distributed as a
plugin for the widely used and freely available molecular graphics
software Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD; http://www.ks.uiuc.
edu/Research/vmdl) (Humphrey et (11., 1996). In addition to the
structure and trajectory ﬁle formats supported by VMD, Bendix
offers secondary structure representation for coarse-grained protein
simulations (Monticelli et (11., 2008). As a VMD plugin, Bendix uses
in-built features such as secondary structure prediction, rendering
options and VMD’s ﬂexible syntax for selecting subsets of atoms
for Bendix characterization. The broad visualization, animation and
analysis capabilities of VMD remain available alongside Bendix.

3 CONTRAST TO SIMILAR TOOLS

There are a number of dedicated analysis software for static
helix structures, e.g. HELANAL (Bansal et (11., 2000), but support
for analysis of helix dynamics over time is restricted to global
descriptors of helix geometry [see e.g. TRAJELIX (Mezei and
Filizola, 2006)]. This limits applicability and lacks geometric
context. Bendix resolves these issues and provides numeric results
that are accompanied by axis-based helix visualization. This
resembles a representation that is implemented in YASARA (http://
www.yasara.org/), but is functionalized in Bendix by geometry-
indicative graphics and analysis.

As part of VMD, Bendix incorporates important features of
existent helix analysis software and complements them with

4 CONCLUSION

Curved at-helices are prevalent in membrane protein structures, and
their ﬂexibility plays a key role in biological function. Despite
this demonstrated importance, methods for helix motion analysis
are limited. We have developed a new tool for analysis of helix
conformational change. Thus, helix characterization in Bendix
aids structure comprehension and allows interactive analysis,
visualization and manipulation of both atomistic and coarse-grained
simulations. Intuitive heatmap display of helix curvature at the point
of interest allows the user to more readily detect potentially relevant
helix distortions over time, thus aiding analysis of the relationship
between structure, dynamic conformational changes and biological
function.

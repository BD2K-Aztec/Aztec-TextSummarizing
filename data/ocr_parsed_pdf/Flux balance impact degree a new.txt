any steady state, and therefore reduces the set of admissible steady-state
ﬂuxes (2) to the reduced feasible set:

AR={xeR"|S-x=0,a5xSbandxi=0,VieR} (3)

We can now formally deﬁne a new notion of FBID of a perturbation, as
the number of reactions that are inhibited in any steady-state following
the perturbation:

DEFINITION 1. A reaction j e [1, n] is impacted by a perturbation R C [1, n]
if Xj = 0 holds for all x 6 AR. The FBID of R is the number of reactions
impacted by R.

We note that, by deﬁnition, all reactions in R are impacted by R, and
therefore the FBID of R is at least as large as the cardinality of R itself. It
can be strictly larger when other reactions, not directly in R, are directly
or indirectly affected by the knock-out of R. For example, in the network
represented on Figure 1, let R = {r4}. We see that reactions r2 and b3
affected by the knock-out of R, and therefore the FBID of {r4} is 3, the
total number of inhibited reactions.

2.2 EM—based computation

In this section, we show how to compute the FBID of any perturbation R
from the enumeration of the EMs of the network. Following Schuster
et a]. (2000), we recall that an EM is a minimal set of reactions that allows
a metabolic network to function in a steady state, i.e. a minimal set of
reactions e,» C [1,n] such that there exists a ﬂux vector e,» e A satisfying
the condition e,»(k) = 0 if and only if kgé e,», where e,»(k) denotes the ﬂux
value of reaction k in the ﬂux vector ei. Interestingly, the set E of all EMs
of a metabolic network forms a basis of admissible steady state ﬂuxes
(Schuster et al., 2002).

We now propose an algorithm to compute the FBID of a perturbation
R from the list E of EMs of a metabolic network:

(1) Compute the set of EMs E of the given metabolic network.

(2) For a perturbation R C [1, n], select the subset of EMs from E that
do not contain reactions in R, that is:

ER={eieE:eiﬂR=(A} (4)

(3) The set of reactions IR impacted by R is computed as the set of
reactions that are not contained in any EMs of ER:

17: =[1,n]\ U e.». (5)

me E72

We now prove that this algorithm is correct, in the sense that the set
IR it outputs in (5) is precisely the set of reactions impacted by R in the
sense of Deﬁnition 1. Let us ﬁrst consider a reaction i e [1, n] that is not
in IR. From (5) there exists an EM e 6 ER such that i e e. The ﬂux
vector e corresponding to e is by deﬁnition admissible and has zero
ﬁux on the perturbed reactions by (4). It therefore belongs to .472, and
because it has a non-zero ﬁux on reaction i, this reaction is not impacted
by R according to Deﬁnition 1. This shows that all impacted reactions
are in IR. Conversely, let us consider a reaction i that is not impacted by
R in the sense of Deﬁnition 1. This means that there exists a ﬂux x e .472
such that x(i) 7A 0. However, by Lemma 1 of Schuster et a]. (2002), as
x(j) = 0 for j e R it can be decomposed as a linear combinations of EMs
that have themselves zero ﬁux on R, meaning that it can be decomposed
as a linear combination of EMs in ER. Because x(i) 7A 0, there must be at
least an EM in ER with non-zero ﬂux in i, meaning that i gé IR. This
shows that all reactions in IR are impacted, which concludes the proof.

To run this algorithm, we need to ﬁrst compute all EMs of a network,
which is a computational demanding task (Gagneur and Klamt, 2004).
Although computation of all EMs of a given metabolic network may
demand a high computation cost, this operation needs to be performed
only once. The rest of the computation (steps 2 and 3) can be done fast.

We use the example given in Figure 1 to elucidate the step 2 and 3.
Suppose perturbation R = {r2,b1} is given. Following the step 2, ER is
the subset with only one mode EMZ because EM 1 , EM4 and EM 5 con-
tain reaction b1 and EM 1 and EM 3 contain both r2. Then we only refer to
ER to compute the impacted reaction set as step 3. In this example, the
impacted reactions are {r1, r2, r4, b1, b3} and the FBID of R is 5.

2.3 Linear programming—based computation

Because the reduced feasible set .472 is deﬁned in (3) by linear constraints,
we propose an alternative algorithm to the EM-based approach based on
linear programming (LP) to compute the FBID of a perturbation. Given
a perturbation R C [1 , n] and a reaction i e [1 , n]\R, we consider the
following optimization problems to decide whether reaction i is impacted
by R:

max xi min xi
subject to S - x = 0 subject to S - x = 0
X,_0,VjeR Xj=0,VjER
a<x<b agxgb

In other words, we perform FVA following each gene knock-out.
However, contrary to classical use of FVA (Shlomi et al., 2009), we are
just interested here in assessing whether the solutions to both optimiza-
tion problems are 0 or not. Indeed, it is easy to see that reaction i is
impacted by perturbation R according to Deﬁnition 1 if and only if the
solutions of both problems are equal to 0 because this means that in
the feasible set of both problems, which is exactly .472, X,» is constrained
to be 0.

In practice, to compute the FBID of a perturbation R containing K
reactions, one should solve a total of 2(n — K) LP, corresponding to two
problems for each reaction i e [1, n]\R. Because each LP can be solved in
polynomial time, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to compute the
impact of all perturbations containing a bounded number of reactions. In
addition, as all LP are related to each other, signiﬁcant speed-up can be
obtained by using warm restart, as implemented in the fastFVA software
(Gudmundsson and Thiele, 2010). Further speed-up is also possible by
solving batches of LP in parallel on a distributed computing environment.

2.4 Implementation

We used both fastFVA (Gudmundsson and Thiele, 2010) and ILOG
CPLEX (version 11.2) (http://www.ilog.com/products/cplex) to solve
the LP instances of the LP-based method, and CellNetAnalyzer which
is a free software running under MATLAB to compute the EMs of a
network (Klamt et al., 2007). All computations were performed on a
PC with a Xeon CPU 3.33GHz and 10GB RAM running under the
LINUX OS.

3 DATA

3.1 The E.coli metabolic networks

We use three versions of the Ecoli metabolic network, as sum—
marized in Table l. The central network is from the KEGG
database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2012),
and iJE660 and iJOl366 are from the BiGG database
(Orth et al., 2011; Schellenberger et al., 2010), stored as
METATOOL and SBML formats, respectively. iJOl366 is the
latest version of Ecoli network, while we keep the older iJE660
in our experiments to allow comparison with previous work
(Edwards and Palsson, 2000a,b; Reed et al., 2003).

We should notice that these networks are obtained as closed
systems, and thus, additional information like sources and

biomass synthetics is needed to make these systems open
(Edwards and Palsson, 2000a; Reed et al., 2003; Wunderlich
and Mirny, 2006). Sources provide compounds to be consumed,
while biomass synthetics are compounds exhausted by the net—
works. In the implementation, we use two types of sources, de—
tailed in the Supplementary Materials. The first source represents
a minimal medium consisting mainly of energy source, carbon
dioxide and oxygen. The other source is a rich environment,
which covers the minimal medium together with 20 amino
acids, biotin, thiamin and riboﬂavin, etc. The Ecoli output bio—
mass is given also in the Supplementary Materials.

3.2 Phenotypic data

To compare our in silico impact predictions with experimental
data, we consider ﬁve datasets used in previous studies to assess
the phenotypic consequences of gene knock—out.

The ﬁrst dataset, collected from literature by Edwards and
Palsson (2000a), measures the growth capability of 79 gene de—
letion mutants, among which 41 are essential, 36 are non—essen—
tial and 2 have been observed as either essential or non—essential.
Following Wunderlich and Mirny (2006), we consider the pre—
dictions of any method on the later 2 genes as always correct to
compute the accuracy of the prediction, while we remove them to
compute receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

The second dataset (insertional mutants), collected by
Badarinarayana et a]. (2001) and further used by Wunderlich
and Mirny (2006), gives the growth rate of 481 mutants obtained
by knock—out of single genes, among which 222 with >50% de—
crease in growth rate are considered essential. While all genes are
available in the iJE660 network, only 461 (including 218 essen—
tials) are present in the iJOl366 network.

The third dataset is the combination of the first two ones.
Although they contain genes in common, we follow Wunderlich
and Mirny (2006) and consider them all different because they
are part of different networks speciﬁc to each dataset.

The fourth dataset, collected by Gerdes et a]. (2003) and fur—
ther used by Wunderlich and Mirny (2006), evaluates the gene
variability of 598 mutants, among which 120 are considered es—
sential. While all genes are available in the i] E660 network, only
571 (including 117 essentials) are present in the iJOl366 network.

The ﬁfth dataset is the KEIO collection, collected by Baba
et a1. (2006), which partitions 4288 mutants into 317 (including
14 newly added by Yamamoto et al., 2009) essential and 3971
nonessential genes. Among them, 81 (respectively 144) essential
and 554 (respectively 1222) nonessential genes are present in the
iJE660 (respectively iJOl366) model.

Because these experimental datasets are under different condi—
tions, we used different input sources and output biomass in the

networks for the different datasets, as listed in Supplementary
Files. In short, for the mutants collected from literature, the
minimal medium set is used to reconstruct four distinct net—
works, each of which includes only one of the energy sources.
For the insertional mutants, we reconstruct the network by
adding the minimal medium input with all energy sources. We
use the rich source set when analyzing the Gerdes dataset and
KEIO collection. As for outputs, all analyses with i] E660 share
the same biomass output (Supplementary Table S3), while for
iJOl366, we use the core growth biomass proposed by Orth et a].
(2011).

4 RESULTS

For each of the three E.coli metabolic networks listed in Table 1,
we computed the FBID of each single gene deletion. Note that
because a gene can catalyze several reactions, the perturbation
set R associated to a gene deletion is the set of reactions cata—
lyzed by the gene. We ﬁrst assess the computational performance
of the approach, before assessing the ability of FBID to predict
phenotypes and compare it with state—of—the—art methods.

4.1 Computation time

We proposed two algorithms to compute the FBID of a perturb—
ation: one approach based on enumerating EM (Section 2.2),
and one approach based on an LP formulation (Section 2.3).
Table 2 shows the total computation time to perform the experi—
ment on each network. For the LP—based approach, this is the
total time to solve all LP with fastFVA; for the EM—based
method, this is the time to compute the EMs of each network
once with CellNetAnalyzer, and then output the list of impacted
reactions for each gene deletion.

We see that the EM—based method is fast for a small network
but not efﬁcient for large ones; in fact, CellNetAnalyzer did not
manage to compute the EMs of both large networks within a
week. This is coherent with the exponential complexity of the
method. On the other hand, although many LP instances need to
be solved for the LP—based method, we see that its polynomial
complexity allows it to better scale to large networks. fastFVA
(Gudmundsson and Thiele, 2010) manages to ﬁnish all compu—
tations on the largest network with 2251 reactions within ~3 h,
and is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than a naive im—
plementation solving all LP instances independently from each
other with CPLEX (see Supplementary Information).

Based on these observations, in what follows we only run the
LP—based implementation with fastFVA to compute the FBIDs
corresponding to the different genes and networks investigated
for phenotypic prediction. The total computation times for both
E.coli global metabolic networks (iJE660 and iJOl366) are sum—
marized in the Supplementary Materials.

4.2 Phenotypic prediction

The FBIDs computed on each network vary signiﬁcantly be—
tween different genes. For example, Figure 2 shows the distribu—
tion of FBIDs for the 1366 genes of the KEIO collection dataset
estimated on the iJOl366 model. While >80% of all genes have
an FBID smaller than 10, it increases to 540 for the msbA
(b0914) gene, a bacterial lipid ﬂippase whose knock—out blocks

ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation, or 448 for acpP
(b1094), a acyl carrier protein that catalyzes polyketide biosyn-
thesis of holo-ACPS; unsurprisingly, both are essential genes.
To assess more quantitatively how predictive the FBID is for
gene essentiality, we systematically compared the FBID corres-
ponding to each gene deletion with the corresponding experimen-
tal phenotypic data, for both versions of the large E.coh'
metabolic network (iJE660 and iJOl366). In each experimental
data, the genes are separated in two classes corresponding to

genes with a large or small phenotypic impact. By thresholding
the FBID to some level, we can predict that genes with an FBID
above the threshold should have large phenotypic impact, while
those below the threshold should not. Figure 3 shows the ROC
curve for each dataset and each network, corresponding to the
sensitivity plotted as a function of l-speciﬁcity when we vary the
FBID threshold. In addition, we show on Table 3 the area under
the ROC curve (AUC) and the accuracy reached in each case,
when the FBID threshold is set for each phenotypic dataset to
maximize the accuracy as in Wunderlich and Mirny (2006).

We can see that phenotype prediction for the iJE660 and
iJOl366 Ecoh' networks are overall similar, with an advantage
for the former on all phenotype datasets. The performance on
the ﬁrst dataset (collected from literature) is rather disappoint-
ing. This can be explained, to some extent, by the fact that we
had to modify the network by using the minimal inputs together
with distinct carbon sources, which resulted in many metabolites
and reactions being always inactive at steady state. The perform-
ance on the insertional mutants dataset is also not good and may
also be due in part to the particular context of using minimal
inputs. For the Gerdes dataset and KEIO collection, FBID per-
forms pretty well on both networks, reaching an AUC of 0.66
and 0.78 for iJE660 and 0.6 and 0.72 for iJOl366, respectively.

To compare the performance of FBID with existing
approaches, we ﬁrst focus on the iJE660 E.coh' network that
was used by Wunderlich and Mirny (2006) to compare SA
(Wunderlich and Mirny, 2006), FBA (Edwards and Palsson,
2000b), MOMA (Segre et al., 2002) and EMA (Stelling et al.,
2002). Results are summarized in Table 4, where we directly
report the accuracies provided by Wunderlich and Mirny
(2006) for existing methods.

On the mutants collected from literature, our approach based
on FBID is clearly worse than SA, FBA and EMA, which reach
high accuracy (90% for EMA). This can be explained, to some
extent, because this collection includes genes that only catalyze
the central metabolism (Edwards and Palsson, 2000a) where al-
ternative paths are numerous when we block a single gene.
Therefore, although changes in optimal fluxes captured by
FBA, or decrease in number of EMs captured by EMA, correlate

well with growth rate, our approach meets difﬁculties in finding
important ﬂuctuations in the number of reactions that become
completely inhibited when a gene is deleted. On the insertional
mutant dataset, all methods reach a similar level of accuracy,
with a slight advantage for SA and MOMA over FBA and
FBID. On the larger Gerdes dataset, FBID and FBA reach the
same level, and clearly outperform SA.

To further investigate the performance of FBID on large net—
works, we compare it with FBA on the largest iJOl366 network
for the prediction of gene essentiality as deﬁned in the KEIO
collection. Figure 4 shows the ROC and precision—recall curves
of both methods. We see that FBID (AUC = 0.72, accur—
acy = 93%) outperforms FBA (AUC = 0.68, accuracy 2 89%)
on this experiment, confirming the potential of FBID on large
networks.

As shown on Figure 5, the predictions of FBID and FBA are
correlated: genes with a large FBID (on the right) often have a
small FBA score (near the bottom), corresponding to two no—
tions of essentiality. However, the correlation is not perfect, and
we observe, for example, a number of non—essential genes with a
small FBA score and a small FBID (near the bottom left); in that
case, the FBID is a better indicator of essentiality. Another ad—
vantage of FBID over FBA is the fact that FBA has difﬁculties
to make a difference between the genes predicted to be essential.
For example, 109 genes out of 1322 have a minimum FBA score
of 0, corresponding to a complete blockage of ﬂuxes; however,
only 48 of them (44%) are truly essential. This means that FBA
can not predict essentiality with >44% precision, as can be seen
on the precision—recall curve (Fig. 4). On the contrary, FBID is
better able to rank the genes with large scores, and can reach
much higher precision than FBA near the top of the list. This is
particularly relevant for applications where we want to predict a
few essential genes with high precision. More details about FBA
and FBID essentiality prediction can be found in the
Supplementary Information.

5 DISCUSSION

We have proposed FBID, a new deﬁnition of impact degree,
which can not only efficiently deal with the reversible reactions
in metabolic networks but also have the state conditions being
taken into account. To compute the FBID against perturbations,
we proposed two algorithms, an LP—based method and an EM—
based algorithm. The advantage of the LP—based method is that
it can solve all LP instances individually, can strongly benefit

Contrary to other LP—based formalisms like FBA, FVA or
MOMA, it does not depend on a subjective deﬁnition of a rele—
vant objective function. Although computational cost of the LP—
based method grows with the network size and the number of
perturbations to be tested, the overall time complexity is still
bounded polynomially. If we are interested in only a few candi—
date perturbations, then only the corresponding LP need to be
solved. The EM—based method, on the other hand, can compute
the FBID of specific perturbations fast for middle—scale net—
works. The main computational advantage of this approach is
that the computation of EMs needs to be performed only once,
no matter how many perturbation we want to test7including
perturbations involving several reactions. This advantage
vanishes for large—scale metabolic networks, however, because
of the exponential complexity of computing EMs and the lack
of efficient algorithms for that purpose.

We carried out computational experiments by using E.coli
metabolic networks. The results on computational time for cal—
culating the FBID of different sized networks show that the LP—
based method implemented with fastFVA is efﬁcient, while the
EM—based method did not return any result for large networks
owing to the difﬁculty of computing the EMs. In terms of pheno—
type prediction, we obtained poor results when we tested meta—
bolic networks with a minimal source input because many
metabolic paths are always closed in this case. Comparison of
the performance of phenotype prediction with some existing
methods indicates that the FBID performs as well as other
models or even better, particularly on large networks.

The interpretation we give of the FBID in terms of EMs
makes an interesting link with existing EM—based methods that
measure how many EMs disappear when we inhibit a reaction
(Behre et al., 2008; Wilhelm et al., 2004). In our case, we also
enumerate the list of EMs that remain once the reaction is in—
hibited, but instead of focusing on the number of EMS remaining,
we focus instead on the number of reactions that can still be
activated in the remaining EMs. Although the number of EMs
in a network has been used as a measure of ﬂexibility and as an
estimate of fault—tolerance (Stelling et al., 2002), we propose here
that the amount of reactions inactivated in cascade may be a

better indicator of gene essentiality. Of course, the number of
reactions inactivated is itself a crude measure, and investigating
variants such as weighting reactions by their ‘importance’ before
counting them may be interesting future work.

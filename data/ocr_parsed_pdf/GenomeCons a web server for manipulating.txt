Abstract

Summary: Genome sequence alignments provide valuable information on many aspects of mo—
lecular biological processes. In this study, we developed a web server, GenomeCons, for manipu—
lating multiple genome sequence alignments and their consensus sequences for high—throughput
genome sequence analyses. This server facilitates the visual inspection of multiple genome se—
quence alignments for a set of genomic intervals at a time. This allows the user to examine how
these sites are evolutionarily conserved over time for their functional importance. The server also
reports consensus sequences for the input genomic intervals, which can be applied to downstream
analyses such as the identification of common motifs in the regions determined by ChlP—seq
experiments.

Availability and implementation: GenomeCons is freely accessible at http://bioinf0.sls.kyushu—u.

1 Introduction

The progress of genome sequencing projects for various species has
now made it possible to compare genome sequences over a wide
range of related species. Genome sequence alignments provided by
the UCSC Genome Browser (Karolchik et (11., 2014) greatly facilitate
the identification of the regions under strong selective pressure by
measuring the conservation in related species.

Genome sequence alignments in the UCSC Genome Browser are
useful for the visual inspection of a genomic region of interest, but
they are not suitable for downloading to perform further
detailed analyses. Moreover, the browser can handle only a single
locus at a time, making it difficult to survey many loci, for
example, a set of the genomic regions identified by ChIP-seq
experiments.

To conduct a large-scale analysis of genome sequence alignments,
it is necessary to download and manipulate the data stored in the
Multiple Alignment Format (MAF) from the UCSC Genome Browser

(Karolchik et (11., 2014). As expected based on the length of an entire
genome and the number of species available, the amount of data in
these genome sequence alignments is huge. Furthermore, genome se-
quences of any two species are not always collinear because of the
genome rearrangements that occur during the course of evolution.
Thus, genome alignments consist of a huge set of small alignment
blocks because of the inclusion of species with various levels of
diversity. Therefore, it is not a trivial task to retrieve a genome se-
quence alignment for a region ofinterest from a huge amount of MAP
files.

A possible solution to this problem is to use a set of specialized
tools for manipulating genome sequence alignments (Blankenberg
et (11., 2011), which have been implemented on the Galaxy web ser-
ver (Goecks et (11., 2010). Recently, another program, MafFilter,
was developed for this task (Dutheil et (11., 2014). These programs
facilitate the highly flexible manipulation of MAP files, but they
also require command-line and/or multi-step operations, which are

in genome—wide association studies, there are often cases where no
genes exist in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block that contains stat—
istically significant markers. If there are some conserved non—coding re—
gions in the LD block, these can be candidates for disease susceptibility
(Ward and Kellis, 2012). Similarly, during exome analysis, single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are specifically identified in patients
may be implicated in pathogenesis even if they are in synonymous sites
because they have functions other than coding such as exonic splicing
regulators (Chamary et al., 2006). Evaluating the conservation of the
positions of synonymous SNVs in multiple genome sequence align—
ments may facilitate the inference of their functional relevance to
pathogenicity.

Abstract

Motivation: Determining the methylation state of regions with high copy numbers is challenging
for second—generation sequencing, because the read length is insufficient to map reads uniquely,
especially when repetitive regions are long and nearly identical to each other. Single—molecule
real—time (SMRT) sequencing is a promising method for observing such regions, because it is not
vulnerable to GC bias, it produces long read lengths, and its kinetic information is sensitive to DNA
modifications.

Results: We propose a novel linear—time algorithm that combines the kinetic information for neigh—
boring CpG sites and increases the confidence in identifying the methylation states of those sites.
Using a practical read coverage of ~30—fold from an inbred strain medaka (Oryzias latipes), we
observed that both the sensitivity and precision of our method on individual CpG sites were
~93.7%. We also observed a high correlation coefficient (H: 0.884) between our method and bisul—
fite sequencing, and for 92.0% of CpG sites, methylation levels ranging over [0,1] were in concord—
ance within an acceptable difference 0.25. Using this method, we characterized the landscape of
the methylation status of repetitive elements, such as LlNEs, in the human genome, thereby reveal—
ing the strong correlation between CpG density and hypomethylation and detecting hypomethyla—
tion hot spots of LTRs and LlNEs. We uncovered the methylation states for nearly identical active
transposons, two novel LINE insertions of identity ~99% and length 6050 base pairs (bp) in the
human genome, and 16 Tol2 elements of identity>99.8% and length 4682 bp in the medaka
genome.

1 Introduction

There has been a great deal of interest in identification of genome—
wide epigenetic DNA modifications in recent years, because DNA
modifications play an essential role in cellular and developmental
processes (Anway et (11., 2005; Miller, 2010; Molaro et (11., 2011;
Schmitz et (11., 2011; Smith et (11., 2012; Weaver et (11., 2004;
Zemach et (11., 2010). Some of human transposable elements (TEs),
such as long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE), transpose ac—
tively within somatic cells along differentiation of neural tissues and
are partly regulated by DNA methylation (Muotri et (11., 2005,
2010). Each family of human TEs exhibits a variety of methylation
statuses in different tissue types, which was found by looking at the
mixture of methylation information on the consensus sequence of
TEs in the same family (Xie et (11., 2013). Many human diseases are
also associated with DNA methylation state of TEs. In particular,
unmethylation of repetitive elements (REs), such as LINE—1 (L1)
elements, has been related to some cancers (Ross et (11., 2010;
Wilson et (11., 2007). Although only a few L1 elements exhibit activ—
ity in the human genome (Beck et (11., 2010), it has been reported in
various cancer genomes (Goodier, 2014; Lee et (11., 2012), and im—
portantly, transposition is correlated with unmethylation in the pro—
moter region of L1 elements (Tubio et (11., 2014). Therefore, it is
essential to develop an experimental framework that can character—
ize the methylation state of REs in a genome—wide manner.

The advent of second—generation sequencing technology has
increased the efficiency of the generation of precise genome—wide
methylation maps at a single—base resolution using bisulfite treat—
ment (Cokus et (11., 2008; Lister et (11., 2008, 2009; Harris et (11.,
2010; Meissner et (11., 2008); however, these sequencing—based tech—
nologies have difficulty in characterizing the methylation status of
Cst in regions that are highly similar to other regions. Bisulfite—
treated short reads from these regions often fail to map uniquely to
their original positions; instead, they are likely to be aligned ambigu—
ously to multiple genomic positions. Especially, the younger and
more active transposons retain higher fidelity and are therefore diffi—
cult to address using short reads.

The PacBio RS II sequencing system uses DNA polymerases to
perform single—molecule real—time (SMRT) sequencing (Eid et (11.,
2009; Korlach et (11., 2008), and is able to sequence reads of an aver—
age length of >10 kb. It is also able to sequence genomic regions
with extremely high GC content. A striking example is the sequenc—
ing of a >2—kb region with GC content of 100% (Loomis et (11.,
2012), indicating that SMRT sequencing is less vulnerable to se—
quence composition bias than first/second—generation sequencing is.

SMRT sequencing of bisulfite—treated DNA fragments may allow
identification of DNA methylation; however, this approach is un—
likely to process long, highly identical repeats because bisulfite treat—
ment breaks DNA into fragments of <1500 bp (Miura et (11., 2012;
Yang et (11., 2015). Instead, we explored another advantage of
SMRT sequencing to detect DNA modifications directly.

2 Approach

In SMRT sequencing, we observe the base sequence in a single DNA
molecule as the time course of the ﬂuorescence pulses which reﬂect
the incorporation processes of nucleotides. From this time course in—
formation, we define the inter—pulse duration (IPD), the time interval
separating the two pulses of consecutive bases. Importantly, the IPD
of the same genomic position varies and has a significant and pre—
dictable response to the presence of DNA modifications and dam—
ages (Flusberg et (11., 2010).

Since the IPD tends to be perturbed systematically when DNA
modifications are present, SMRT sequencing has been used to detect
5 —hydroxymethylcytosine (Flusberg et (11., 2010), N4—methylcytosine
(Clark et (11., 2012), N6—methylademine (Fang et (11., 2012; Feng
et (11., 2013; Flusberg et (11., 2010; Greer et (11., 2015) and damaged
DNA bases (Clark et (11., 2011) in bacteria and mitochondria.
Though the sequence motifs with modifications can be detected
with very low coverage (Beckmann et (11., 2014), estimation of 5—
methylcytosine (5—mC) residues using low—coverage reads is chal—
lenging. It requires extensive coverage (~500><) at each position to
clarify the base—wise 5—mC state and therefore becomes costly (Fang
et (11., 2012; Flusberg et (11., 2010; Schadt et (11., 2012). Clark et al.
(2013) attempted to improve the detection of microbial 5—mC in the
Escherichia coli and Bacillus halodurans genomes using Tet1—
mediated oxidation to convert 5—mC into 5caC in SMRT reads of
~150>< coverage per DNA strand. Therefore, kinetic information
from low—coverage SMRT reads at a single CpG site is not reliable
for predicting the methylation status.

In this study, we exploited the facts that unmethylated CpG di—
nucleotides are rare (~10%) in vertebrates and generally do not
exist in isolation but often range over long hypomethylated regions
(Bock et (11., 2008; Eckhardt et (11., 2006; Gifford et (11., 2013;
Nautiyal et (11., 2010; Qu et (11., 2012; Shoemaker et (11., 2010; Xie
et (11., 2013). Su et al. (2012) reported that the average length of
hypomethylated regions in five human cell types is ~2 kb. Thus, esti—
mating regions with unmethylated CpG sites is informative in most
cases. Moreover, integrating kinetic information over many CpG
sites in a long region can increase the confidence in detecting methy—
lation when the status of those sites is correlated. Therefore, it
shows promise for predicting the methylation status in a block using
low—coverage SMRT reads. In the rest of this article, we examine the
feasibility of the approach and present a novel computational algo—
rithm that integrates SMRT sequencing kinetic data and determines
the methylation status of CpG sites.

3 Methods
3.1 Outline of our method Agln

Figure 1A shows a schematic representation of the basic concept of
our method. To eliminate the context—dependent ﬂuctuation of the
IPD values, we calculated the IPD ratio (IPDR) on each genomic
position as previously described (Flusberg et (11., 2010). This normal—
ization is essential to compare the IPD values from different genomic
positions with various sequence contexts. Then, we defined the
IPDR profile of a CpG site as an array of IPDR measurements of
21 bp surrounding the CpG site because these neighboring positions
have proven to be effective in predicting 5—hydroxymethylcytosine,
N4—methylcytosine and N6—methylademine in bacteria genomes in
previous studies (Clark et (11., 2011, 2012; Fang et (11., 2012;
Flusberg et (11., 2010). With low coverage, the IPDR profiles at indi—
vidual CpG sites are noisy and insufficient for determining whether
each CpG site is methylated or not. However, if we could somehow
identify the boundaries of hypomethylated/hypermethylated regions
and take the average of the IPDR profiles for the Cst within each
region, then it would allow better prediction of the methylation state
of each region from its average IPDR profile, which has less noise
than the profile of a single CpG site. Averaging the IPDR profiles is
also expected to alleviate the possible confounding effect from other
types of modifications found in DNA. An example of our prediction
for the human genome is shown in Figure 1B. Our method was able
to estimate hypomethylation of long duplicated regions while the

Fig. 1. Outline of our integration method. (A) The top three distributions show the typical inter-pulse duration ratio (IPDR) profiles within 10bp of the CpG sites in the
raw data. The IPDR profiles of individual CpG sites were treated as points in the 21-dimensional feature space. Red-colored unmethylated Cst and blue-colored

methylated Cst are often difficult to separate using a hyperplane. Therefore, initially, we had little knowledge about the methylation status of each CpG site from the
raw data, as illustrated by the question marks at the CpG sites. Our algorithm predicts the boundary of unmethylated and methylated CpG sites. The average IPDR
profiles of the two regions, which have clearly distinct IPDR profiles, are shown below the two regions separated by the boundary (see the detailed IPDR profiles in

Supplementary Fig. 818). Red circles and blue boxes represent unmethylated and methylated Cst, respectively, predicted by our algorithm (annotated as ‘predicted

regions') and were observed by bisulfite sequencing (labeled ‘answer'). In the feature space, red and blue disks represent the IPDR profiles of predicted regions. (B)

Comparison of our prediction with the available human genome methylome data. From top to bottom, black bars indicate hypomethylated regions predicted from

SMRT sequencing data using our method. Yellow and black bars show the methylation level and read coverage obtained from public bisulfite sequencing data, re-
spectively, and blue boxes show hypomethylated regions predicted from the bisulfite data. Green bars below indicate the alignability of short (100—bp) reads. The bot-
tom row shows repeat masker tracks. Both methods are consistent in showing hypomethylation on the three blue-colored regions. No read counts of the bisulfite

data are available in long duplicated regions where the alignability is quite low, but our method can estimate hypomethylation in these regions

bisulfite sequencing provided little information. Supplementary
Figure S1C illustrates another example in which both methods were
consistent in showing hypomethylation in the gene promoters.

3.2 Estimating the methylation status at each CpG site
Suppose that the focal genome has n CpG sites. We denote the gen—
omic position of C of the ith CpG site by 17,-(i : 1, . . . ,n). For ex—
ample, if the C of the second CpG site is at the 10th genomic
position, .” ‘pz : 10.’ Our goal is to predict the methylation status,
unmethylated or methylated, at 17,- using information of the read
coverage and the IPDRs at positions surrounding 17,. 21 neighboring
positions are denoted by p,- +/ for j : —10, . . . ,+10 in the plus
strand. For example, the positions 5 bases upstream and down—
stream of p,- are p,- — 5 and p,- + 5, respectively.

We used the SMRT Analysis pipeline to process raw kinetic data
from SMRT sequencing to obtain the mean IPDR and the read cover—
age at each genomic position. Let r,- and r;- denote the mean IPDR
associated with position i of the forward and reverse strands, respect—
ively, and let c,- and c;- denote the read coverage at position i of the for—
ward and reverse strands, respectively. To achieve a better prediction,

we derive a modified IPDR vector from the raw read coverage and the
IPDRs within 10 bases around 17,. For this purpose, we consider that
the property that any CpG site in one strand is reverse complementary
to the CpG in the other strand, and the methylation status of Cs at a
pair of CpG sites in both strands is consistent in most cases, making it
meaningful to combine IPDR information for both strands to predict
the methylation status. To represent positions in the minus strand, we
note that since we set 17,- to the position of C of the focal CpG in the
plus strand, the position of C of the CpG in the minus strand is p,- + 1,
and the surrounding positions are p,- + 1 —/ for j : —10, . . . , +10.
We attach more importance to the IPDR values associated with a
higher read coverage and we quantify this as c1“,- >< rpm- in the plus

strand in the minus strand). We then take the sum of

(Gian—i X rin+1—i
all the products and normalize it by dividing it by the total coverage.
Finally, we obtain the 21—dimensional modified IPDR vector for 21

genomic positions around CpG site 17,:

We are now in a position to define a classifier that uses 2(1),) as
explanatory variables and predicts the methylation status at 17,. We
attempted to use linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with the dis—
criminant function

F071): I? - 2(a) + I.

where we optimized the values of coefficient vector [i and variable v
using bisulfite sequencing data as the training dataset to improve the
prediction. Supplementary Figure S1A and D shows the optimized
vector [i that we used in this study. We do not claim this vector is
the simplest one since excluding the low—contributing components
from the parameter degraded the accuracy only by a little
(Supplementary Fig. S3G). If the sign of the discriminant function,
F(pi), is positive, the methylation status at p,- is defined as ‘methy—
lated’; otherwise, it is defined as ‘unmethylated’. Our goal is to
achieve a higher accuracy using a lower read coverage in order to re—
duce the cost.

3.3 Predicting the methylation status of CpG blocks

In vertebrates, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are rare (~10%)
and do not always exist in isolation, but they are likely to range over
long hypomethylated regions. This motivates us to integrate low—
coverage reads around Cst in a region to yield high—coverage for
estimating the methylation status in the entire region, rather than at
a single—base resolution. Let A denote a region. The following for—
mula expresses the average IPDR vector for 21 genomic positions
around all the CpG sites in region A and its associated discriminant
function:

ZpiEAICpM’pM + Cpi+1—i'/zn+1—j)

m). z
I ZpiEA(Cpi+/' + Gina—i)

F<A> :ﬁ-X<A>+v

Processing a longer region with sufficient CpG sites can improve
the accuracy of the prediction, although it may overlook smaller re—
gions. In our analysis, we imposed the constraint that each region
contained at least b CpG sites. For example, we can set b to 50 be—
cause the average length of hypomethylated regions in five human
cell types is approximately 2 kb (Su et (11., 2012) and the average dis—
tance between neighboring CpG sites in the medaka genome is 53.5
bases, although this constraint should be adjusted according to each
individual situation. The possibility of the hypermethylation (hypo—
methylation, respectively) of A increases with a larger positive
(negative) value of F(A), as well as for a larger total coverage,

WM) 2 2 (am + Cjwbi).
piEAIi:—10,...,+1O

A with a larger magnitude of w(A)F(A) is better for prediction.

3.4 Decomposing the genome into
hypomethylated/hypermethylated CpG blocks

Now, we must consider how to decompose n CpG sites in the whole
genome into hypermethylated regions {M 16A} and hypomethylated
regions {UMEM} such that all regions are disjoint from each other,
their union covers all CpG sites, and the two types of regions occur

alternatingly along the genome. We calculate the optimal decompos—
ition of regions that maximizes the following objective function:

Zw(M;,)F(M/~,) + Z —w(U,,)F(U,,).
26A HEM
To simplify this problem, we here mention one important char—

acteristic of SMRT sequencing, that is, read coverage is not affected
by the sequence composition (Bashir et (11., 2012; English et (11.,
2012; Koren et (11., 2012; Loomis et (11., 2012; Zhang et (11., 2012).
Thus, the average coverage in A is constant at any position within
10 bp relative to Cst. Technically, we can assume that the average
of coverages at the ith position around all the CpG sites in region A
is a constant c that is dependent of A but is independent of /:

ZpieA(CPi+i + Cin+1-i)

:c for /:—10,...,10,
IAI

where IAI denotes the number of CpG sites in A. This allows us to

transform w(A) into a simpler form:

w(A) : Z (CPHrI' + Cin+1_,-) : ZIEIAI
piEAIi:—10,..,,+1O

Subsequently, we simplify the objective function:

where 5,- denotes 21 (vc + Z ﬁi(cp,+,-rp,+,- + c§i+1_ir;,i+1_i)).
Finally, the objective function is a linear combination of 5,:

ZW(M2)F(M2) + Z -W(Uu)F(Uu) = Z Z 5i + Z Z (-$i)

16A HEM 26A pIEMI HEM [7.6th

Although we set 5,- to a score calculated from weighted IPDR in—
formation, we can set 5,- to a log—likelihood function of the form —
logQ, for some likelihood function Q,. This simple form motivates
us to design an O(n)—time dynamic programming algorithm for cal—
culating the optimal value efficiently. We consider the sub—problem
involving the first i CpG sites among all 71 sites, and let Sf” and S? be
the maximum values of the objective function when the last ith CpG
site is methylated and unmethylated, respectively. Sf” and SP meet
the following recurrences:

The first max term implies extension of the running region by
one CpG site, while the second term means a switch from the previ—
ous methylation status and the initiation of a new region with 2 b
CpG sites. For example, we can set b to 50, but one can change the

requirement for the minimum number of CpG sites in a region by
making an appropriate adjustment to the second term. OfSﬁ‘t” ande],
the larger value gives the maximum value, and tracing back the opti—
mal path from the maximum value provides all the boundaries be—
tween neighboring methylated and unmethylated regions. To
calculate regions satisfying the constraint on the minimum number
of CpG sites, we generalized the dynamic programming idea pro—
posed by Csﬁros (2004). One might wonder if the hidden Markov
Model (HMM) can be used for computing hypomethylated and
hypermethylated regions; however, it is not obvious that using
HMM guarantees the requirement that each range has 2 b CpG
51tes.

4 Results

4.1 SMRT sequencing and bisulfite data benchmark

We collected 31.06—fold coverage SMRT subreads from the testes of
medaka Hd—rR (assuming an estimated genome size of 800 Mb)
using P6—C4 reagents (Supplementary Methods). We also collected
22.45—fold and 13.06—fold coverage SMRT reads from human per—
ipheral blood of two Japanese individuals. Thus, we have three data—
sets in total, 1 for medaka and 2 for human. For sequencing two
human samples, we employed the P6—C4 reagents and the P4—C2 or
C2—C2 reagents, respectively (Supplementary Methods). In total
2848641, 7279594 and 19115712 subreads mapped to the medaka
genome and the human genome, respectively. The mean mapped
sub—read lengths were 8722 bases for medaka and 9254 and 2049
bases for 2 human samples (Supplementary Table S1).

As CpG methylation status reference data, we used the testes
methylome of the medaka Hd—rR inbred strain by way of Illumina
bisulfite sequencing (Qu et (11., 2012). In this dataset, most of the
CpG sites in the medaka genome are either unmethylated or methy—
lated, and methylation at non—CpG sites is very rare (~0.02%),
allowing us to focus on CpG sites only. We evaluated the prediction
accuracy of our integration method using the methylation scores cal—
culated from bisulfite—treated Illumina reads as the answer set. Let S
be the set of bisulfite—treated Illumina reads covering the ith CpG
site, x be the number of methylated Cst in S at i, and y be the
coverage of S at i (the size of S). We then defined the methylation
status as ‘unmethylated’ if the score x/y was less than 0.5; otherwise,
it was defined as ‘methylated’. We need to carefully constrain the
value of the coverage y. Allowing a lower value of y is likely to pro—
duce more erroneous methylation scores, while using y greater than
a higher threshold would reduce the number of Cst associated
with their methylation scores. The average coverage was 9.40—fold
in our bisulfite—treated reads collected from testes of the Hd—rR me—
daka inbred strain; however, the coverage at individual CpG sites
varied to some extent. We defined the methylation score only when
the CpG site was covered by 10 or more reads (i.e. y 2 10) in order
to make sure the scores were robust enough.

4.2 Computational performance

Our linear—time algorithm allows us to handle vertebrate—scale gen—
omes with millions of CpG sites in a reasonable amount of time. It
took 2.265 s on average to process 1 Mbp (1191 s to handle
525.7Mb of medaka genome v.1) using a laptop PC (Intel i7—
3612QM processor with a clock rate of 2.10GHz and 7.8 GB of

main memory).

4.3 Predicting the methylation state from kinetic data
We implemented our method using linear discrimination of the vec—
tors of (average) IPDR profiles around the CpG sites. We repre—
sented the vectors as points residing in the Euclidean space of the
appropriate dimension and attempted to separate the points by a de—
cision hyperplane (Fig. 1A). For better accuracy, we optimized two
parameters of the decision hyperplane, the orientation and the inter—
cept. Supplementary Figure S1A (for P6—C4 reagents) and D (for P4—
C2 reagents) shows the optimized orientation. Our method divides
the genome into regions containing 2 b CpG sites, such that each re—
gion is either hypomethylated or hypermethylated. While setting
lower bound b to 50 is supported by the plausible heuristics with
biological grounds, a looser bound (b<50) allows us to detect
shorter regions. We, therefore, examined when we could use a
smaller value of b (2 30, 35, 40, 45) without degrading the accuracy
of prediction.

We predicted the methylation status of each CpG site by check—
ing whether the CpG site was located in an hypomethylated or
hypermethylated region output by our method. We measured the ac—
curacy of the prediction by checking the consistency between the
prediction and the methylation score associated with each CpG site.
CpG sites without methylation score (due to the lack of bisulfite—
treated reads) were ignored. We treat an unmethylated status as
positive and a methylated status as negative because we are more
interested in identifying rare hypomethylated regions accounting for
a small portion (e.g. ~10%) of CpG sites.

To evaluate the accuracy of our method, we used the chromo—
some 1 of length 34 959 811 bp in the medaka genome (version 2)
that we assembled from SMRT sub—reads. For predicting CpG
methylation accurately, we guaranteed that each CpG site was cov—
ered by at least three sub—reads, and set the coverage to 0 otherwise,
which slightly reduced the original average read coverage, 31.06—
fold, to 29.9—fold on the chromosome 1. We calculated various ac—
curacy measures, such as sensitivity (recall), specificity (1—false—posi—
tive rate) and precision by comparing our prediction on each CpG
site with the methylation level determined in a bisulfite sequencing
study (Qu et (11., 2012). As most CpG sites in the medaka genome
are methylated consistently, there are only a small number of posi—
tive examples of unmethylated Cst, and therefore, precision is
more informative than specificity in evaluation. We made the trade—
off between sensitivity and precision through the selection of the
intercept of the decision hyperplane (—8.0 S v S 5.0) (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Figs. S2—S3). When we used 100% of 29.9—fold sub—
reads, setting b to 35 outperformed the other values (Fig. 2A). Our
prediction achieved 93.7% sensitivity and 93.9% precision, or 93.
0% sensitivity and 94.9% precision, depending on the selection of
the intercept. To examine the coverage effect, we used five subread
sets of coverage 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of 29.9—fold. For cover—
ages of 20 and 40% of 29.9—fold, setting b to 50 performed best
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Both sensitivity and precision were ~90%
for b :45 even if the coverage is relatively small, 60% of 29.9—fold
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). In selecting b, it was suggested to use a
larger value (b :50) when the read coverage is small (15—20—fold)
so that the cumulative coverage (750—1000—fold) is large enough.
One can use a smaller value (b : 35) with sufficient read coverage
(~30—fold), and b can be decreased gradually with deeper coverage.
Setting b to 1 corresponds to the case where the methylation state of
each CpG is predicted independently, but it could not achieve a
good accuracy, which confirmed the merit of our aggregating ap—
proach (Supplementary Fig. S3F). The ROC curve, the tradeoff be—
tween false—positive rate and sensitivity, is also shown in Figure 2B.

of true-positives among the predicted positives) are evaluated on individual
CpG sites when we change the intercept of the hyperplane (between -8.0 and
5.0) and set the minimum number of CpG sites in a region, b, to 30, 35, 40, 45
and 50. (B) The ROC curve of false-positive rate and sensitivity

Overall, sensitivity and precision of our method are substantially
high using a reasonable coverage of SMRT subreads.

4.4 Handling intermediate methylation states

We have introduced the two—class model of our prediction that as—
signs all of the CpG sites into either hypomethylated or hypermethy—
lated regions; however, such a dichotomous model is rather
unrealistic, and more refined predictions involving multi—level
methylation states or even continuous methylation levels are desir—
able. For example, an intermediate level of CpG methylation could
result from the distinct methylation states of two DNA molecules of
diploid cells, although each cytosine must be either methylated or
unmethylated in a single DNA molecule. More generally, a cell
population can be epigenetically heterogeneous, which would pos—
sibly show a spectrum of methylation levels according to its compos—
ition. Finally, prediction allowing intermediate states can represent
the ambiguity of the prediction, and exclusion of such ambiguous
predictions should improve the overall prediction accuracy.

Thus we extended our method in order to achieve more inform—
ative multi—class prediction and quantify the methylation level of
each CpG, which we call discrete methylation level (DML,
Supplementary Methods). Specifically, DML is calculated as the
average prediction over the set of 10 parameters with different
sensitivity—specificity combinations, thus it measures the robustness
of the prediction. We checked the accordance between our DML
and intermediate or ambiguous methylation level captured by two
other quantitative methods, bisulfite sequencing and Illumina
BeadChip. On the medaka sample, we observed a strong correlation
(R : 0.884) between our DML and methylation level calculated
from bisulfite sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S4C and E), and we
confirmed that measurements on 92.0% of CpG sites were in con—
cordance within an acceptable difference 0.25. We also compared
our DML on the human sample to the beta value (an indicator of
methylation level expressed as a value ranging over [0,1]) obtained
from Illumina BeadChip after normalizing the beta values
(Supplementary Methods). We observed a weaker correlation
(R : 0.816, Supplementary Fig. S4D) and a smaller fraction (75.
4%) of CpG sites in concordance within 0.25 presumably because
the beta value is less quantitative than the methylation level calcu—
lated from bisulfite sequencing (Wang et (11., 2015). With the
sequencing depth in our case, CpG sites with intermediate methyla—
tion were more difficult to predict than completely methylated/
unmethylated cases (Supplementary Fig. S4E). Therefore, excluding
the prediction with intermediate levels improved the accuracy of the

binary prediction (Supplementary Table S2). We concluded that
DML serves to reﬂect the quantitative nature of methylation status
in the samples to some extent, and is informative in achieving more
accurate prediction as well.

4.5 Genome—wide methylation pattern of repetitive
elements in the human genome

We investigated how individual occurrences of repetitive elements
(REs) were methylated in the human genome (Fig. 3A). Since some
occurrences of REs contain no or very few CpG sites, we only con—
sider those occurrences with at least 10 Cst to exclude less inform—
ative cases. First, we checked whether SMRT reads could address
the repetitive regions in a useful manner for methylation analysis.
Specifically, we considered a repeat occurrence to be covered by
uniquely mapped SMRT reads if the IPD ratio was available on
250% of Cst. We found that >96% were covered for every repeat
type. To draw robust conclusions, we further applied a stringent
quality control to each repeat occurrence so that the average read
coverage be >5. Although this step reduced the number of repeat oc—
currences to be analyzed by 3—18%, this could be mitigated simply
by producing more data. Finally, we treated an occurrence as hypo—
methylated if 250% of Cst were predicted as unmethylated.
Similarly, we considered an occurence as methylated intermediately
if 250% of Cst were predicted as 0.3—0.7 in DML measurement.
Fractions of hypomethylated repeat occurrences vary considerably
among different classes of REs, from ~1% for L1 and Alu to N5 0%
for MIR and >70% for simple repeats and low—complexity regions.
The fraction of intermediately methylated repeats was 1.4% among
all the repeat classes.

To validate our prediction regarding the repeat occurrences, we
selected 21 regions for bisulfite Sanger sequencing, designed primers
for nested PCR (Supplementary Table S3), and could amplify six re—
gions (Supplementary Methods), indicating the difficulty in observ—
ing DNA methylation of REs using traditional bisulfite Sanger
sequencing. In five (1 L1, 3 LTRs, 1 MIR) among the six amplified
regions, we confirmed the consistency between our prediction and
the methylation state observed by bisulfite Sanger sequencing
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The other one L1 element was predicted
hypomethylated. In this region, however, five unmethylated CpG
sites were followed by five methylated CpG sites, which showed our
method was not reliable in determining the precise boundary and
the individual calls should be interpreted carefully.

We then examined the features for characterizing the differences
between hypermethylated and hypomethylated REs. First, CpG
density was significantly higher in the hypomethylated occurrences
in almost all classes of REs (P < 1%, Fig. 3B). This observation
was consistent with the known association between CpG—rich re—
gions and unmethylation because methylation leads to depletion of
CpG sites through deamination (Cooper and Krawczak, 1989).
Second, sequence divergence from the representative in each repeat
class showed a correlation with methylation status (Fig. 3C). For
most classes, with the apparent exception of simple repeats, low—
complexity regions and MIR elements, hypomethylated occurrences
were significantly more divergent than were hypermethylated occur—
rences (P < 1%, Fig. 3C), presumably because younger copies of a
repeat element are less divergent and are likely to be targets of DNA
methylation. Kernel principal component analysis (PCA) using spec—
trum kernel suggested, for some repeat types, that the methylation
statuses were correlated partly with sequence features
(Supplementary Fig. S6).

we select using the Repeat Library 20140131 (Smit, A., Hubley, R. and Green, P. Repeatmasker open-4.0 at http://www.repeatmasker.org). (B, C) Distribution of CpG
density (B) and sequence divergence from the representative in each repeat class (C) for methylated (lower box) and hypomethylated (upper box) repeat occur-

thylated repeat occurrences to all occurrences in each 5-Mb bin is indicated by color shadings. We used the Ideographica web server to generate the image

Next, we examined whether the hypomethylated repeat occur—
rences were distributed uniformly or non—uniformly throughout the
entire genome. We selected three major classes (LINE, Alu and
LTR) of REs for this analysis. We calculated the ratios of hypome—
thylated copies to all REs in individual non—overlapping bins 5 Mb
in size (Fig. 3D). The non—random distribution patterns were more
evident for LINE and LTR than for Alu. For example, we found
hypomethylated LINEs to be enriched in the p—arm of chromosome
1 and in chromosomes 17 and 19. There were hypomethylation ‘hot
spots’ of LTR elements, e.g. in chromosomes 6 and 9
(Supplementary Fig. S7). It is intriguing that some of these hypome—
thylation hot spots, such as those in the p—arms of chromosomes 6
and Y, seem to be shared among different classes of REs.

We further investigated the methylation states of LINE/L1 elem—
ents, the only known active autonomous retrotransposons in mam—
mals (Furano, 2000). Although most of LINE/L1 insertions contain
many mutations, Penzkofer et al. (2005) categorize full—length L1
elements into three classes according to the conservation of two
open reading frames (ORFs); namely (i) L1s with intact in the two
ORFs that are likely to exhibit retro—transposition activity, (ii) L1s
with an intact ORF2 but a disrupted ORF1 and (iii) non—intact L1s
with two ORFs disrupted. We obtained the positions of these human
LINE/L1 elements from L1Base (Penzkofer et (11., 2005) and ana—
lyzed their methylation stateses (Supplementary Table S4). Although
0.61% of non—intact L1s were hypomethylated, all of L1s with in—
tact in two ORFs and L1s with an intact ORF2 were hypermethy—
lated. We also checked the presence of LINE insertions that were
novel to the hg19 reference genome. We assembled the SMRT reads
using the FALCON assembler and searched the assembly for novel
LINE insertions that matched a hot L1 element (GenBank: M80343.
1) of size 6050 bp with identity > 98.5%. The hot L1 element was

used as the representative according to the procedure of L1Base
(Penzkofer et (11., 2005 ). We identified two novel instances covered
by sufficient depth of SMRT reads that allowed us to call their
methylation statuses confidently. Both of the two LINE insertions
(their locations are in Supplementary Fig. S8) were estimated to be
methylated. These results confirmed putatively active LINE/L1
elements with intact ORFs were preferentially methylated.

4.6 Tol2transposable element in medaka

Medaka has an innate autonomous transposon known as TolZ,
which is one of the first examples of autonomous transposons in ver—
tebrate genomes and a useful tool for genetic engineering of verte—
brates, such as zebrafish and mice (Kawakami, 2007). The excision
activities of TolZ are promoted when DNA methylation is reduced
by 5—azacytidine treatment, which suggests that DNA methylation is
one of the mechanisms regulating the TolZ transposition (Iida et (11.,
2006). Nevertheless, observing the methylation status of each TolZ
copy using short reads is difficult, because TolZ is 46 82 b in length,
and ~20 highly similar copies of TolZ exist in the genome (Koga
et (11., 2000).

To elucidate the methylation status of each TolZ copy, we
applied our method to a new assembly of the Hd—rR genome ob—
tained exclusively from SMRT reads. BLAST search identified 17
copies of TolZ contained entirely within this assembly, all of which
were essentially identical (>99.8% sequence identity). We then
called the methylation status of these TolZ. For comparison, we
mapped the publicly available bisulfite—treated reads from the testes
of the Hd—rR strain to these contigs and determined the methylation
level on every 100—bp window using Bismark software.

Relative genomic coordinate

Fig. 4. Methylation analysis of Tol2, a 4682-bp long autonomous transposon, in medaka. The new genome assembly ofSMRT reads had 17 regions (contigs) that
contained complete Tol2 copies. The circles show our prediction of the methylation state of CpG sites, while the rectangles show the methylation states within
each 100 bp window obtained from bisulfite sequencing. For both tracks, open indicates unmethylation and filled indicates methylation. The arrow above indi-
cates the region of Tol2 insertions. As the eleventh 11th region was located at the extreme of the contig, Tol2 was not observed successfully by either SMRT
sequencing or bisulfite sequencing. For the other 16 regions, methylation of T012 was observed consistently by SMRT sequencing, while virtually no information

was available on the Tol2 region from bisulfite sequencing

The methylation status of these TolZ, observed by SMRT reads
and bisulfite—sequencing, are shown in Figure 4. While virtually no
TolZ copies were mapped by bisulfite reads, as expected from their ex—
tremely high fidelity, 16 of 17 copies were anchored by SMRT reads,
and all were predicted to be hypermethylated by our method. For the
regions examined by both SMRT reads and bisulfite—treated short
reads, our prediction was consistent with the methylation level calcu—
lated from the bisulfite—treated reads. For example, one TolZ copy
was surrounded by hypomethylated regions (number 14). From the
bisulfite data, it appeared that the body of TolZ, from which data
were missing, was hypomethylated. Nevertheless, our prediction esti—
mated this region to be hypermethylated. These results demonstrate
the ability of our method using SMRT reads to clarify DNA methyla—
tion states of highly identical REs such as active transposons.

5 Discussion

In this study, we addressed the problem of uncovering the landscape
of DNA methylation of repetitive elements (REs). To this end, we
developed a unique application of SMRT sequencing to epigenetics.
This direction had been already explored in the research community
for bacterial and viral species. However, this application in large
vertebrate genomes has been largely unexplored because of the sub—
tle cytosine methylation signals in the kinetic information.
Therefore, we proposed a new method to utilize relatively small
amounts of kinetic information by incorporating a model reflecting
our prior knowledge on the regional patterns of CpG methylation of
vertebrate genomes. We confirmed the validity of our strategy by
comparing the prediction to bisulfite sequencing data on medaka
and to BeadChip analysis on human samples. These two datasets
had very different characteristics, which seemed to be partly because
of the methods used (i.e. BeadChip was designed to observe mainly
CpG islands that are often hypomethylated, while bisulfite sequenc—
ing is used for genome—wide methylation analysis) and partly be—
cause of the nature of the samples used (i.e. the medaka samples
were derived from an inbred strain, while the human samples were
from diploid cells). Despite such differences in characteristics, our
method using the same parameters performed almost equally well
for both datasets. These observations suggested that the choice of
parameters is robust for a wide variety of samples, which is a

desirable feature for any method. We also presented an extension of
our method to accommodate intermediate methylation states, the
discrete methylation level (DML) and confirmed a high correlation
(R : 0.884) between DML and bisulfite methylation level.

We explored the epigenetic landscape of REs within the human
genome. Using the hg19 reference genome is an apparent limitation.
By assembling individual personal genomes instead of the reference
genome, new insertions of these REs are expected to be found, and
such active occurrences should be of interest. Indeed, we detected
two novel LINE insertions that were estimated to be methylated.
Importantly, the more recent the insertion event, the less divergent it
would be from the original copy, and therefore, there would be less
likelihood of it being anchored by short reads. In such cases, long
SMRT reads shed new light on the ecosystem of active REs in per—
sonal human genomes.

We demonstrated the use of long SMRT reads can increase the
potential comprehensiveness of the epigenetics study. In addition,
our method can substantially reduce laboratory work. For example,
in the projects of resequencing or de novo assembly using SMRT
sequencing, you can call the methylation statuses of the sample as
well, completely in silico, without any additional experiment. This is
another important strength compared to conventional bisulfite
sequencing or affinity—based assays.

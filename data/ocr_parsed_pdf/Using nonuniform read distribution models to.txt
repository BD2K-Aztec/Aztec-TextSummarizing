ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA-Seq technology based on next-generation
sequencing provides the unprecedented ability of studying
transcriptomes at high resolution and accuracy, and the potential
of measuring expression of multiple isoforms from the same gene at
high precision. Solved by maximum likelihood estimation, isoform
expression can be inferred in RNA-Seq using statistical models
based on the assumption that sequenced reads are distributed
uniformly along transcripts. Modification of the model is needed
when considering situations where RNA-Seq data do not follow
uniform distribution.

Results: We proposed two curves, the global bias curve (GBC)
and the local bias curves (LBCs), to describe the non-uniformity
of read distributions for all genes in a transcriptome and for each
gene, respectively. Incorporating the bias curves into the uniform
read distribution (URD) model, we introduced non-URD (N-URD)
models to infer isoform expression levels. On a series of systematic
simulation studies, the proposed models outperform the original
model in recovering major isoforms and the expression ratio of
alternative isoforms. We also applied the new model to real RNA-
Seq datasets and found that its inferences on expression ratios of
alternative isoforms are more reasonable. The experiments indicate
that incorporating N-URD information can improve the accuracy in
modeling and inferring isoform expression in RNA-Seq.

1 INTRODUCTION

Applying next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies
to transcriptomes (RNA-Seq) makes it possible to precisely measure
the abundances of transcripts. This technology has been widely
investigated on the study of gene expressions (Marioni et (11., 2008;
Nagalakshmi et (11., 2008), splice variants (Fan et (11., 2008; Wang
et (11., 2008; Wilhelm et (11., 2008), novel transcripts discovery
(Mortazavi et (11., 2008), RNA sequence polymorphism (Cloonan
et (11., 2008) and Chimeric transcripts (Zhang et (11., 2010) in recent

literature. The ability of RNA-Seq to count sequenced reads along
transcripts gives digital measurement of transcription levels, and is
powerful for identifying and measuring the amount of transcribed
isoforms of alternative splicing genes (Wang et (11., 2008).

Changes of isoforms’ expression levels in many genes are
of functional importance in particular biological processes. For
example, switching between major and minor isoforms of genes
plays a crucial role in mouse muscle myogenesis (Trapnell et (11.,
2010); isoform expression Changes have been shown to be highly
related to the development of many complex diseases, such as
Lewy bodies (Beyer et (11., 2008; Humbert et (11., 2007) and
progressive supranuclear palsy (Chambers et (11., 1999); studies also
obtained the evidence that the expression ratio of two alternative
isoforms from human progesterone receptor (PR) gene could result
in different outcomes of breast cancer treatment (Cork et (11.,
2008). Therefore, correctly estimating isoform expression levels
is becoming increasingly important for understanding complicated
biological mechanisms.

In RNA-Seq, under the assumption that the sequenced reads
are sampled independently and uniformly on all transcripts in the
sample, it is straightforward to model the distribution of read counts
of exons as a Poisson distribution (Mortazavi et (11., 2008). Using
a uniform read distribution model (URD model for short), Jiang
and Wong (2009) proposed a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)
method to infer isoform expression levels. However, some studies
show that there are substantial biases in high-throughput sequencing
data (Dohm et (11., 2008), which may cause non-uniformity of read
distributions in RNA-Seq data (Mortazavi et (11., 2008). Recent
literatures also pointed out that hexamer priming and local sequence
content can affect the sequencing preference (Hansen et (11., 2010;
Li,J. et (11., 2010). In our investigations, we observed the distributions
of RNA-Seq reads in many datasets are not uniform. Some datasets
have a strong bias toward the 3’ ends of transcripts, which means that
the 3’-ends usually have more reads sequenced. This phenomenon
may be caused by some pre-sequencing procedures such as the
poly(A)-selection step in sample preparation (see Section 4 for
details).

In such situations, the accuracy of isoform expression inference
based on the uniformity assumption will deteriorate. Thus, the
motivation of this study is to develop a method that takes the
non-uniformity of read distribution into consideration to improve
isoform expression inference. Recently, several other groups also
realized the importance of this problem and incorporated non-URD
(N-URD) information into uniform distribution models in different
ways (Howard and Heber, 2010; Li,B. et (11., 2010). In our study, we

Non-uniform read distribution models in RNA-Seq

 

introduced two types of curves to depict the tendency of sequencing
biases, namely the global bias curve (GBC) and the local bias curves
(LBCs). The GBC applies to all genes in a dataset and the LBCs
are speciﬁc to particular genes. The curves are estimated from the
read distribution across the measured transcripts. We incorporated
the GBC and LBCs with the URD model and constructed N-URD
models for isoform expression inference. A series of simulation
experiments were conducted to study the performance of the
proposed method and to compare with state-of—the-art methods.
Results show that a signiﬁcant gain can be achieved in the accuracy
of isoform expression inference. We applied the N-URD models on
several real RNA-Seq datasets, which also illustrated the advantage
of the proposed method.

2 METHODS
2.1 Notations
Assume gene G has n exons of lengths (11,...,1,, ). It has in isoforms with
expression levels (61,...,6,,,) in an experiment. From RNA-Seq data. we

have a set of reads of counts (x1, . . . ,xn) on this gene. where x]- is the number
of reads mapped onto the j-th exon of gene G. The task is to infer the
expression levels (91 , . . . , 6m ) from observed read counts and the known gene
structure (the exon composition of each isoform). We use an indicator matrix
(av-)mm to represent the gene structure. where ay- 2 l or (1,} = 0 indicates that
the j-th exon is included or excluded in the i-th isoform. respectively. If an
exon appears in two (or more) isoforms as different lengths (e.g. the case
of alternative 5’ end or 3’ end exons). we split the exon into several parts
and treat each part as an exon. Similarly. when we consider reads mapped
to exon junctions (junction reads). we can use the ﬂanking exon segments
of a junction to form a ‘pseudo-exon’ and count it as an extra exon in the
inference. In the experiments. we did on data of ultra-short reads. we did
not consider junction reads for simplicity as they compose only a very small
part in the data.

2.2 Bias curves

We propose two types of bias curves to characterize the distribution of
reads along a transcript. The GBC represents the general tendency of read
distribution for the whole transcriptome. and the LBCs depict gene-speciﬁc
read distributions. The curves reﬂect the relative read distribution bias from
the 5’ end to the 3’ end of a gene.

We use genes with only single isoforms to estimate the GBC. This is
because the read distribution of the gene with multiple isoforms is affected
by the gene structure and may not reﬂect the general tendency of read
distribution along the gene. We extracted all single-isoform genes according
to the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) gene annotation (downloaded
from http://genome.ucsc.edu). Because of the uncertainty in lowly expressed
genes. we ﬁlter out genes with too few (<100) reads. In order to avoid the
impact of local ﬂuctuation of read distribution. we divide each gene into a
small number (e.g. 10) of bins and get a bar chart or histogram of the read
counts across the bins. The histograms are then normalized to mean 1. and
then averaged among the number of studied single-isoform genes. This gives
us the GBC. which reﬂects general sequencing efﬁciency at different relative
locations of a gene in the dataset. Usually. we illustrate the GBC in the form
of curves instead of bar charts. The procedure for calculating the GBC is
illustrated in Figure l. The GBC depicts the global read distribution bias
which may be caused by the experimental protocol. It is consistent between
technical replicates in the data we studied (Section 3).

It is also observed that read distribution of a speciﬁc gene can have its
own pattern that deviates from uniform distribution and also from the GBC.
This kind of bias may be due to local sequence features such as GC-content
variation along transcripts and simple sequence repeats in the genome. which
may affect the hexamer priming efﬁciency (Hansen et (11.. 2010) and read

Fig. 1. The ﬂowchart of the calculation of the GBC. The main steps include:
(I) collect single-isoform genes according to known gene annotation; (2)
ﬁlter out genes which have too few mapped reads (read-count <100); (3)

mappability (Rozowsky at (11.. 2009). We introduced the LBCs to describe
gene-speciﬁc non-uniform distributions.

Read distribution of a gene with multiple isoforms is the mixture of
read distributions of all its expressed isoforms. So a LBC could only be
an approximate description of trend of read distribution along the gene
region. We deﬁne for each gene a step function which is constant on each
exon. Suppose the expression level of the i-th isoform is 6,». we assign the
value of the step function on thej-th exon as xj/ (1]-  Qiaij ).j = 1,2, . . . , n.
which describes the read count normalized by the exon length and isoform
occurrences weighted by their expression levels. The reads on an exon also
may not distribute uniformly. This can be considered by splitting an exon
into multiple ‘sub-exons’ when there are sufﬁcient reads for the exon. In
our experiments. we take an exon as the basic unit for estimating the LBCS.
The LBC of a gene is got by normalizing the step function to be of mean
1. At the beginning of expression inference. the isoform expression levels
are unknown. so we assume expression levels of all isoforms of a gene
are identical (1,1)lxm in the calculation of the LBC. After inferring
isoform expression with this initial LBC. we can further update the LBC
using the inferred isoform expression levels 6,». and sequentially iterate this
procedure. The details of this iteration procedure will be illustrated in details
in Section 2.4. Figure 2 gives the conceptual ﬂowchart for calculating the
LBCs.

We use the bias curves to compensate for read-count variations caused by
such biases in inferring isoform expression. For this purpose. we partition
the bias curves into several segments corresponding to exons of the gene.
The mean value of the curves on each segment is calculated as the weighting
factor for the corresponding exon. Figure 3 illustrates this procedure. In the
following sections. we will show the strategy to incorporate such weights
into the statistical framework of isoform expression inference.

2.3 The URD model

In the URD model used by Jiang and Wong (2009). each observation x]-
is assumed to be a random variable following a Poisson distribution with
parameter A]: For example. M for the j-th exon is M =lijELJaiJ-9i. where
w is the total number of mapped reads in the RNA-Seq data and (1,7 is the

Due to the convexity of above optimization problem. the gradient descending
method can be used to ﬁnd the solution (J iang and Wong. 2009).

2.4 The N-URD models

Upon the above URD model. we propose N-URD models by substituting the
indicator matrix (aij) with a weighted indicator matrix (173) whose elements
are non-negative real numbers calculated from the bias curves. We can
rewrite the log-likelihood function as

Rather than the (L1 indicator matrix ((1,7). the weighted indicator matrix (1),!)
not only represents the gene structure information. but also gives weights to
the non-zero elements according to the bias tendency of corresponding exons.
It is notable that changing the indicator matrix to the weighted indicator
matrix will not change the convexity of the optimization problem. Different
choice of the weighted matrix will result in different N-URD models.

Given a bias curve. say. the GBC. we assign weights to each exon in the
studied isoform following the strategy in Figure 3. We repeat this procedure
for every isoform in the gene. and obtain the weighted indicator matrix (GU).
whose non-zero element represents the relative weight of j-th exon in the
expression of i-th isoform. Here. (GU) indicates the weighted matrix is got
from the GBC. We call the N-URD model with (11,7): (GU) as the GN-URD
model.

Similarly. we can get the weighted indicator matrix (LU) starting with a
LBC. Letting (17,7) = (Li!) results in the LN-URD model. To make use of the
combination of the GBC and LBC. we can let (bU)=(Gij)cx+(LiJ-)(l —oz)
and get the MN-URD model. In this study. we chose 01:05 to illustrate
the property of the MN-URD model. Besides these three models. we further
study two additional models which use iterative calculation of the LBC in the
MN-URD model. We denote them by l-M and 5-M which mean the number
of iterations is l and 5. respectively. The iterative procedure is:

(1) Set (él,...,é,,,)=(1,  1) and STEP=O;

(2) Calculate the LBC using xj/(lj  éiaij) . and then get (17,7) 2
(0001+ (L27) (1 W):

(3) Conduct expression inference based on (17,7) using MN-URD. and get
the estimated expression values (01,...,é,,,);

(4) STEP=STEP+1. if STEP exceed the maximum number. exit;
otherwise go to Step 2.

2.5 Simulation design

As there is no benchmark data with known isoform expressions. we designed
a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed

method. In each experiment setting (with ﬁxed numbers of isoforms and
exons), a number of simulated genes were generated in a random manner.
The indicator matrices that specify gene structure were created ﬁrst. We set
the proportion of 1’s in the elements of indicator matrices to be consistent
with the RefSeq gene annotation (~80%). The lengths of exons of the
simulated genes were randomly sampled from the exon lengths in the RefSeq
gene annotation. In order to simulate transcriptome data with similar read
distribution properties as real data, for each simulated isoform, we randomly
sampled the expression level (RPKM) and the corresponding LBC from the
RPKMS and their corresponding LBCs of single-isoform genes in real RNA-
Seq data. For each isoform, we assigned weights of exons according to the
corresponding LBC (similar to Fig. 3c and d). The reads count for each exon
of the gene is determined through sampling from Poisson models.

We studied genes with numbers of isoforms varying from 2 to 5 and
numbers of exons from 6 to 13. For each setting, we generated 1000
different gene structures randomly. We applied the original URD model
and the proposed N-URD models to the simulated data and compared their
performances.

2.6 RNA-Seq datasets

The proposed N-URD model was applied to two transcriptome RNA-Seq
datasets. We also used these data to provide the information (single-isoform
gene expression levels and LBCS) for generating our simulation data. The
dataset by Marioni et a1. (2008) is composed of about 120 millions reads from
the human liver and kidney tissues. The dataset by Pan et a1. (2008) consists
of transcriptome data from diverse normal human tissues each of which have
17732 millions reads. We downloaded both of them from the Sequence Read
Archive (SRA, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/Traces/sra). The read lengths of
the two datasets are 36 and 32 bp, respectively. For brevity, we refer to these
two datasets as Marioni data and Pan data, respectively. We used TopHat
(Trapnell at 611., 2009) to map reads to the human genome assembly UCSC
hg18 (NCBI build36) with up to two mismatches allowed. Reads mapped
to multiple genomic loci were excluded. We observed that RNA-Seq data
of different tissues from the same laboratory share large similarity on the
global pattern of read distribution, so we only took the data of one tissue in
each dataset as an example for the presentation and demonstration.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Bias curves describe the N-URDs

We ﬁrst calculated the GBCs in the two real RNA-Seq datasets. The
GBCs for each lane of the Marioni data are shown in Figure 4, and
that for the Pan data is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Each
curve in Figure 4 corresponds to a technical replicate of the liver
tissue sample in Marioni RNA-Seq data. All curves show strong
distribution bias toward 3’ ends of transcripts. We also see obvious
distribution biases on single-isoform genes (e.g. Supplementary
Fig. S2). The high correlation coefﬁcient (averaged R2=0.996)
between the GBCs of the technical replicates indicates that there are
consistent distribution patterns in the same experiment. Comparing
Figure 4 with Figure S1, the different shapes between GBCs from
the Marioni data and from the Pan data indicates the existence of
batch-effect between experiments.

We divided the whole set of single isoform genes in the Marioni
data into several subgroups according to lengths of genes and
compared the corresponding GBCs. The results are shown in
Supplementary Figure S3. We observed very similar GBC patterns
between the groups. Therefore, the read distribution bias described
by the GBC reﬂects the consistent pattern that holds for genes with
different lengths.

3.2 Experiments on simulated data

We applied the proposed N-URD models and the original URD
model to simulation datasets generated according to expression
patterns in the Marioni data and Pan data. Each method gives
an estimation of the expression levels of all isoforms on each
simulated data. In a gene, the estimated values of isoforms can
be summarized as an expression vector or a frequency vector
for relative expression. There are several ways for quantitatively
comparing two frequency vectors. However, as the importance of
different isoforms varies and has not been well understood in most
cases, such measurements are not straightforward for biological
explanations. In most biological studies, it is most important to
identify the major isoforms (the isoforms with highest expression
among their alternatives) of alternatively spliced genes in the studied
sample. Therefore, we use a major isoform recovery rate or MIRR
to assess the estimation of the isoform expression, deﬁned as the
percentage of genes whose major isoforms are correctly identiﬁed.

Table 1 summarizes the MIRRs achieved by all compared
methods in 1000 simulated genes for each (m,n) setting. These
simulations were based on the Marioni data. Results with
simulations based on the Pan data are provided in Supplementary
Table S1. We can see that the N-URD model with different
implementations all show improvement over the URD model. On
average, MN-URD, l-M and 5-M improve the MIRR by 16.7,
16.9 and 17.0%, respectively, on the Marioni simulation data,
respectively. We can also observe that with the increase of the
number of isoforms (m), the MIRR given by both the URD and the
N-URD models goes down, because more isoforms induce more
uncertainty in the inferences and the expression level of the major
isoform is less different from those of minor isoforms. The advantage
of N-URD models is more obvious in those more complicated
situations. All methods give better performance when there are more
exons (n) in genes with the same number of isoforms. Overall,
different implementations of the N-URD model perform similarly
but the MN-URD and 1-M, 5-M methods perform better in most
cases, demonstrating the beneﬁts of incorporating the global and
local distribution information.

the MIRRs. The columns 277 list the MIRRs under each model. The ﬁgures in bold
indicate the largest MIRR in each row.

Besides the MIRR, we also used a more comprehensive
measurement to compare the estimated expression vector with the
true expression vector. We deﬁned a diﬁ’erence score or DS for this
purpose. If the true expression levels of m isoforms are (61,...,6m)
and the estimates are (01, ...,0m), the DS is deﬁned as

m
DS=1OOZ
i=1

The smaller DS reﬂects the more accurate inference.
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 summarize the DSs of different
models on simulation data generated from the Marioni data and the
Pan data with different parameter (m, n) settings. We can see that the
N-URD models reduce the DS by at least 24% and 10% comparing to
the URD model on the two simulation datasets, respectively. Similar
to the observation with MIRRs, MN-URD and the iterative methods
(l-M and 5-M) achieve the smallest averaged DS in most cases.
One-sided paired t-tests show that the improvements of the N-URD

model over the original URD model are signiﬁcant (Supplementary
Tables S4 and S5).

We also generated another set of simulation data with gene
structures from RefSeq gene annotations. These simulation results
are consistent with the above simulation studies (see Supplementary
Table S6).

3.3 Application on real RNA-Seq data

We applied the both the URD model and the MN-URD model on
the liver transcriptome RNA-Seq data from Marioni et (11. (2008).
For the 3946 genes annotated with multiple isoforms that have at
least 10 reads per gene in the data, the identiﬁed major isoforms
by URD and MN-URD are consistent on 3554 (90.1%) genes. We
calculated the DSs between the estimates of the URD and MN-URD
models for each gene with multiple isoforms. The histograms of the
DSs are shown in Supplementary Figures S4 and S5. Among the
genes with big DSs (DS >30 for two-isoform genes, or DS >60 for
three-isoform genes), a few examples are shown in Figure 5 with the
read distribution along the transcripts. The corresponding inference
results by the URD and MN-URD models are listed in Table 2.

As an example, the difference of the URD and MN-URD models
can be clearly seen in gene SLCO2B1. The gene has three isoforms
in the annotation, but the isoform NM_007256 is inferred as not
expressed by both methods. For the other two isoforms, the URD
model infers that the NM_001145212 is the major isoform whereas
the MN-URD shows that the NM_001145211 is the major one. We
can grasp the possible reasons for this discrepancy by looking at the
details of the read distribution along this gene in Figure 5. It can be
seen that the density of reads falling in the leftmost four exons of
NM_001145211 is not comparable with that of the right side exons.
Because these four exons are included in NM_001145211 but not in
NM_001145212, the read density of these four exons would reﬂect
the expression level of NM_001145211. In the URD model, the
estimation of expression levels of the two isoforms is dominated by
strong signal near the 3’ end. This makes the contribution of the
alternative exons very small in the estimation and causes inaccurate
inference of the isoform expression. In the MN-URD model, the
strong biased signal near the 3’ end was weighted down, which
enables more accurate inference of the isoform expression from the
exons away from the 3’ end. Similar explanations can be found in
the other two examples and many other genes.

4 DISCUSSION

N-URD along a transcript is widely observed in many RNA-Seq
datasets. We introduced bias curves to describe such distribution
patterns in each dataset and in each gene, and proposed to
modify the uniform model with these distribution informations.
Experiments show that the proposed non-uniform models can give
better estimation of isoform expression levels and identify major
isoforms more accurately.

Biological reasons of the non-uniformity in the read distribution
are not fully understood yet. The degradation of mRNA may play a
main role for the global distribution pattern. As reported in literature,
mRNA degradation can initiate from either the 5’ end or 3’ end of
mRNAs (Beelman and Parker, 1995). In mRNA studies, usually a
ploy(A) selection step is adopted. This puriﬁcation also removes the
RNA molecules decaying from the 3’ ends, but not those decaying

from the 5’ ends. As a result, if the RNA-Seq library is constructed
from total RNA with partially degraded RNA molecules, there would
be more reads toward the 3’ ends of the transcripts, and the read
distribution is therefore similar to what is shown in Figure 4 and
examples in Supplementary Figure S2. One the other hand, local
sequence features could explain a large part of the gene-speciﬁc
distribution patterns (Li,J. et (11., 2010). Sequence constitution such
as GC-content along genes may play the most important role in
ampliﬁcation, while other features may lead to biased hexamer
priming (Hansen et (11., 2010). Studying the cause of sequencing
preference may help to improve the protocol of RNA-Seq, but
recently published RNA-Seq data, such as the data generated by Harr
and Turner (2010), also suffered from a strong global distribution
bias and local biases as well.

Recently, Li,B. et (11. (2010) and Howard and Heber (2010)
also addressed the non-uniform distribution issue from different
viewpoints and proposed their models and methods for gene

and/or isoform expression-level estimation. Li et (11. ’s work majorly
focused on solving read mapping uncertainty, but their method
could accommodate the general distribution bias in the expression
inference through the usage of the empirical read start position
distribution (RSPD). They did not utilize the local sequencing
preference speciﬁc to genes (Li,B. et (11. 2010). Our study shows
that properly combining the global and local read distribution
information is an effective way to improve the expression inference.
Howard and Heber proposed a linear model to integrate the non-
uniformity information, but their model was based on a normal
approximation rather than the Poisson distribution. This makes their
model less accurate in the inference. We conducted a series of
experimental comparison with these newest methods and the results
are summarized in the Supplementary Materials.

For the future study, several aspects in N-URD modeling could be
addressed. First, as the read length by new sequencing technologies
becomes longer, there will be more junction reads crossing two

or more exons. These junction reads make up ‘pseudo-exons’ and
could be helpful in the inference of alternative spliced isoforms and
their expression levels. The proper combination of the GBC and
LBCs is another important question. In this study, we used a ﬁxed
mixture parameter (0.5) to integrate them according to simulation
experiments. More adaptively strategies, such as dynamic weighting
of the two bias curves during the iteration of expression inference,
would give further improvement. Another issue is about the gene
annotation. The current model depends on known gene annotation
for the inference. Ideally, it will be more useful if the inference can
be done with incomplete annotation. In such scenario, the task of
inferring isoform expression level will be integrated with the task
of detecting alternative splicing isoforms from RNA-Seq data.
Accurately measuring the expression of genes and their multiple
isoforms is the ﬁrst step in applying RNA-Seq technology to many
biological investigations. With the promising results obtained by
the N-URD models, we believe that the data-adaptive strategy
proposed here will beneﬁt downstream analyses such as detecting
differentially expressed genes and isoforms in human diseases.

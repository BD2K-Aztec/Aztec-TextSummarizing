who carefully selected a high—quality—benchmark set (PDBbind
core set V2007) and assessed 16 well—known scoring functions,
including ﬁve scoring functions [LigScore (Krammer et al.,
2005), PLP (Gehlhaar et al., 1995), PMF (Muegge, 2006;
Muegge and Martin, 1999), Jain (Jain, 1996), LUDI (Bohm,
1994, 1998)] in the Discovery Studio software version 2.0, five
scoring functions (D—Score, PMF—Score, G—Score, ChemScore,
F—Score) in the SYBYL software version 7.2, one scoring func—
tion [GlideScore (Friesner et al., 2004, 2006)] in the Schrodinger
software version 8.0, three scoring functions [GoldScore,
ChemScore (Eldridge et al., 1997), ASP (Mooij and Verdonk,
2005)] in the GOLD software version 3.2, two stand—alone scor—
ing functions [DrugScore (Gohlke et al., 2000; Velec et al., 2005)
and X—Score (Wang et al., 2002)] released by academic groups.
We can use Cyscore against the same benchmark set for a fair
comparison. The test results for the 17 scoring functions are
shown in Table 1. In terms of the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁ—
cients (R) and the standard deviation (SD), Cyscore outperforms
all of the tested scoring functions on this benchmark test.
Moreover, we followed their newly deﬁned ‘ranking power’
test, which benchmarks the ability to correctly rank the known
ligands bound to a common target protein when native binding
modes are known (Cheng et al., 2009). Cheng et a]. divide the
above data set into 65 groups of proteiniligand complexes, each
of which contains a high—affinity ligand, a medium—afﬁnity ligand
and a low—afﬁnity ligand bound to a common protein. Scoring
functions are evaluated by the success rate which counts for the
ratio of correctly ranked groups in all the test groups. This test
examines the ability of a scoring function to discriminate the

structure changes of ligands, which is relevant to lead optimiza—
tion and virtual screening studies because their aim is to rank
molecules in the order of their binding afﬁnities to the target
protein. As shown in Table 2. Cyscore achieves a 53.8% success
rate, which ranks the second best among the scoring functions.

Further more, we did another benchmark test using the most
recent updated set of PDBbind (core set, version 2012). For
comparison, two freely available stand—alone scoring functions
are used, that are, X—Score (version 1.3) and DSX (DrugScore
eXtended, a new improvement of DrugScore) (Neudert and
Klebe, 2011). Their performances are among the top—scoring
functions according to the above tests. Our results show that,
the correlation coefficient of Cyscore is 0.630, while the values of
other two scoring functions are less than 0.600 (Table 3, correl—
ation Supplementary Fig. S4), and the success rate of Cyscore
achieves 56.7% in ‘ranking power’ test, better than the other two
scoring functions (Table 4). These results indicate that Cyscore
has considerable and consistent performance.

The above benchmark tests illustrate the ability of scoring
functions to evaluate binding affinities of diverse proteini
ligand complexes. Generally, the inaccurate prediction of solv—
ation energies and configurational entropies are the major limi—
tations of present scoring functions (Cheng et al., 2009; Huang
et al., 2010). Compared to other empirical scoring functions,
such as X—Score, ChemScore, PLP, LUDI, LigScore and Jain,
Cyscore has the similar or even simpler terms in composition.
The main difference is in the method of calculating hydrophobic
free energy, which is one of the main components of solvation
energy. For example, X—Score implemented three types of hydro—
phobic terms, which were the conventional surface model, atom
contact number based term and atom type—dependent contact
term (Wang et al., 2002). All the three methods ignored the ef—
fects of surface curvature on hydrophobicity. It is also a draw—
back of the solvation energy terms in most force—ﬁeld—based

scoring functions. As for the knowledge—based scoring functions,
the curvature information may be obtained by the inverse
Boltzmann relation, but the effectiveness is still practically un—
known because it relates to the extension of pairwise potentials to
many—body potentials (Huang et al., 2010). Taken together, the
encouraging performance of Cyscore suggests the signiﬁcance of
our work on designing the better algorithm for hydrophobic free
energy.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The hydrophobic effect plays a central role in bio—molecular rec—
ognition. It is estimated to provide, perhaps, 75% of the free
energy of most binding or association events (Snyder et al.,
2013). Despite its importance, calculating hydrophobic energy
is far from accuracy due to its complex origin in nature. In this
article, we proposed a curvature—dependent surface—area model
to estimate hydrophobic energy in proteiniligand binding.
Compared to the conventional surface—area model, the new
model is not only theoretically more exact, but also particularly
more effective in the benchmark tests. Based on this discovery,
we developed a new empirical proteiniligand scoring function,
named Cyscore. In terms of binding afﬁnity correlation, Cyscore
outperforms a variety of well—established scoring functions in our
tests. Of note, Cyscore performs better for ligands binding in
narrow pockets, due to their larger contribution of the curvature
factor to hydrophobic free energy. To our knowledge, the curva—
ture—dependent surface tension has not been explicitly analyzed
and taken into consideration in most of the state—of—the—art scor—
ing functions. Thus, we believe our model will be useful to the
study of proteiniligand interactions. In practice, Cyscore can be
used in the molecular modeling applications whose accurate
binding positions are accessible, such as lead optimization,

binding—mode prediction (see additional experiments in
Supplementary Table S6) and drug—resistant mutation predic—
tion. It should be mentioned that, Cyscore has not been opti—
mized for Virtual screening, which strongly depends on the
particular docking method.

In the present article, we mainly focus on identifying whether
and how much the curvature—dependent surface—area model con—
tributes to the proteiniligand binding affinity scoring. And in
order to reduce the risk of overtraining, the composition of
Cyscore is relatively simple in contrast to some other scoring
functions. This limits the accuracy and universal applicability
of Cyscore. For example, Cyscore does not count the water
mediated proteiniligand interaction, the chargeicharge inter—
action and the nisystem interaction. Moreover, the calculation
of entropy is a complex task. For simplicity and efﬁciency,
Cyscore just counts the number of rotatable bonds of ligands
to evaluate the entropy loss. In the future, we plan to adopt
more detailed terms and larger training sets to achieve more ac—
curate and general predictions of the proteiniligand binding
afﬁnity.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Here, we report the development of a filtering
framework designed for efficient identification of both polyclonal
and independent errors within SOLiD sequence data. The filtering
utilizes the quality values reported by SOLiD’s primary analysis for
the identification of the two different types of errors. The filtering
framework facilitates the passage of high-quality data into a variety
of functional genomics applications, including de novo assemblers
and sequence matching programs for SNP calling, improving the
output quality and reducing resources necessary for analysis.
Availability: This error analysis framework is written in Perl and
runs on Mac OS and Linux/Unix systems. The filter, documentation
and sample Excel files for quality analysis are available at
http://hts.rutgers.edu/fi|ter and are distributed as Open Source
software under the GPLv3.0.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are
revolutionizing biological research by their ability to generate
millions of short read sequences in a relatively short time frame.
Not only do these platforms expand our knowledge by their ability
to sequence genomes, they also expand studies in the related ﬁelds
of transcriptome and proteome research (Ondov and Varadarajan
et (11., 2008; Pettersson and Lundeberg et (11., 2009). One of the
most recent HTS platforms comes from Applied Biosystems (ABI,
now Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA), the Sequence by
Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection (SOLiD) HTS platform
(http://solid.appliedbiosystems.com). This system uses a ligation-
mediated sequencing strategy that is less prone to some of
the problems associated with the polymerase-based sequencing
platforms. Unlike other platforms, SOLiD data are collected using
colorspace, a representation of two-base encoding, thus requiring a
conversion step to attain DNA sequence (Supplement of McKeman
and Peckham et (11., 2009). This two base encoding requires dual
interrogation of each base during SOLiD’s sequencing process
aiding in distinguishing sequencing errors from true polymorphisms
(McKeman and Peckham et (11., 2009; Smith and Quinlan et (11.,
2008; Valouev and Ichikawa et (11., 2008). The SOLiD platform
outputs two types of ﬁles after primary analysis: a sequence ﬁle
in colorspace and a quality ﬁle containing the corresponding

quality values (QVs). The QVs are calculated by training the
sequencing process parameters (image intensity, a noise to signal
value and angle) against several annotated datasets. The QVs exhibit
a linear relationship between observed and predicted phred-scale
quality scores (Hyland and Wessel et (11., 2009). In essence, the
QVs represent the probability of the color call being inaccurate,
i.e. the higher the QV the higher the conﬁdence in the color call’s
accuracy.

In contrast to other HTS platforms, the SOLiD platform does not
preﬁlter low-quality reads. Therefore, all reads where the two-base
transition can be identiﬁed, even if with poor quality, are reported
after primary analysis. This becomes a crucial problem when dealing
with de novo assembly of short read sequences since their assembly
is highly sensitive to sequencing errors. Therefore, it becomes
critical to mitigate these errors prior to assembly. There are two types
of sequencing errors commonly observed, polyclonal/correlated
errors and independent, erroneous color calls (Valouev and Ichikawa
et (11., 2008). Polyclonal and correlated errors occur when the entire
read is of poor quality or missequenced due to a bead level problem
such as in a polyclonal bead or poor resolution of a particular bead.
A polyclonal bead occurs when two different templates are ampliﬁed
on a single bead and then sequenced, resulting in a hybrid sequence
that has no match in the true genome. While the original goal was
to identify polyclonal beads, there is no guarantee that all the reads
identiﬁed by this part of the ﬁlter are due to polyclonality. A more
robust ﬁltering system using the information gathered during the
sequencing run, image intensity, noise to signal and angle, could be
designed to distinguish between polyclonal beads versus other types
of correlated errors. Single color call errors are independent and can
occur multiple times in the sequence also leading to an inaccurate
sequence.

Here, we present a ﬁltering framework that attempts to optimize
the preprocessing step by identiﬁcation and removal of error prone
reads for the SOLiD platform using the QVs provided from the
SOLiD’s primary analysis. This algorithm ﬂexibly targets the two
different types of errors that can occur during SOLiD sequencing.

The goal of the preprocessor is to eliminate the low-quality reads
and pass only the high-quality data into downstream applications,
saving both resources and improving ﬁnal output quality.

To identify sequencing reads with either polyclonal calls
or miscalls, we utilized several resequencing datasets where
few mismatches were expected between the reference sequence
and the sequencing reads. Using these datasets, proﬁles for
both polyclonal/correlated errors and erroneous color calls were
determined through various QV analyses. Using the SOLiD mapping
pipeline, the reads were matched to the reference sequence, and
similar to other HTS platforms, the number of errors increased

(A) Location of errors in the SOLiD reads. The errors increase on the
3’-end of the read. while the 5’-end of the read remains relatively error
free. (B) The QVs of the identiﬁed errors from the SOLiD matching
pipeline. QVs lower than 10 overwhelmingly correspond to detected errors
based on their identiﬁcation by the matching pipeline. (C) Results for
Caenorhabditis elegans matching before and after ﬁltering (ﬁlter settings

toward the 3’-end (Chaisson and Brinza et (11., 2009). In spite of the
genome being sequenced (Escherichia coli, DH] OB; Arabidopsis,
AtCol; or human, Hu3), fewer errors at the 5’-end of the read were
identiﬁed (Fig. 1A). The lower error rate between DHlOB/AtCol
and Hu3 is due to a difference in sequencing chemistry (SOLiD
v2 vs. v3). From the graph plotting error as a ﬁlnction of QV, it
was very clear that color calls with QVs of 10 or less had a higher
probability of being erroneous (Fig. 1B). Single color call errors
occur randomly throughout the sequence; polyclonal beads seem
to reﬂect subpar color calls all throughout the read, i.e. lower than
expected QV values at the 5’-end of the sequenced read. Analysis of
the QVs show that early color calls can be highly predictive for the
remainder of the read (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, polyclonal
analysis focuses on the quality of the ﬁrst 10 color calls, requiring
that some portion of them be of high quality (QV 3 25).

While ﬁlter defaults exist (min polyclonal counts: p: l,
polyclonal min QV: p_QV=25, max errors identiﬁed: e=3, max
QV to identify independent errors: e_QV: 10), the settings of
the parameters should depend upon the error tolerance of the
downstream applications, such as mapping, de novo assembly or
transcriptome analysis. The user has the ability to deﬁne both the
counts and the QV which determine the removal of a read from
the dataset. The more conservative the parameters, the smaller
the resulting dataset which successﬁilly passes the ﬁltering criteria
(Supplementary Tables 2—4).

When the ﬁlter is applied to a Caenorhabditis elegans
resequencing dataset using the stringent settings (p = 3, p_QV = 22,
e=3, e_QV=10), the raw reads were reduced from 40M reads
to 5 M. Mapping of these reads increased from 56% to 96%. Of
the reads that failed the ﬁlter, 38% still mapped with 0—2mm.
However, for both the unﬁltered and the failed reads, many reads
matched with l or 2mm, while the ﬁltered reads had the highest
percentage of reads mapping with 0 mm. These results demonstrate
that the ﬁlter can effectively identify perfect reads, which would
be necessary for applications like de novo sequence assembly.
While reducing the errors within the dataset is highly critical for
a quality assembly, most assemblers contain error identiﬁcation
protocols and will attempt removal even if absent. In addition,
extreme reduction of coverage could potentially be more harmful
than the presence of few errors. In a practical de novo assembly
project, we found that the settings should be much more relaxed
(A.Dayarian et (11. (2010) SOPRA: an algorithm for high quality de
novo assembly of paired reads via statistical optimization. Available
at www.physics.rutgers.edu/ anirvans/SOPRA/).

This error analysis framework was designed to overcome memory
constraints imposed by uploading both the read and the quality ﬁles
into memory. The program sacriﬁces runtime to have a minimal
memory footprint. Additional script details, including user-deﬁned
input table, ﬁgures, tables, functionality and SOLiD data run details
are described in the Supplementary Material section.

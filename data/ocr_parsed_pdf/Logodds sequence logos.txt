Log-Odds Sequence Logos

 

Our proposal is simply to replace R0?) or U0?) with one of the two
alternative measures, A0?) or 130?), as deﬁned and discussed below.
Although the proposed change may appear minor, in the protein align-
ment context it can have important consequences for the appearance,
interpretation and use of sequence logos.

The WebLogo program (Crooks et al., 2004) implements a number of
modiﬁcations to the original theory (Schneider and Stephens, 1990).
These modiﬁcations are not described in detail either in Crooks et a].
(2004) or in the program’s user manual, but examination of the code
reveals they are different in substance and spirit from those we advance
here. Thus, for brevity, accuracy and clarity, we will compare our
proposed measures of column information only with the original measure
R0?) of Schneider and Stephens (1990) and its uncorrected form U0?).
The measure implemented by WebLogo is the closest in form and out-
put to U0?).

2.2 The log-odds perspective

The average per-observation information available for distinguishing a
stretch of symbols that follows a known probability distribution 5 from
a stream of symbols that follows a background distribution 13 is gener-
ally understood to be the distributions’ relative entropy (Cover and
Thomas, 1991):

L .
Dom?) E qulogzﬂ (3)
j=1 171'

By continuity, one may set Olog20 E 0, and thus render D well-deﬁned for
5 in which some components are zero. The asymmetry of D in 5 and 13
can be understood by considering the relative ease of recognizing a stretch
of a dozen fair coin ﬂips within a sea of million that are 99.9% biased
toward heads, compared with the converse.

To recognize a DNA motif within a long stretch of DNA is a similar
problem, except that the frequency of nucleotides within the motif dif-
fers from the background frequencies in a position-dependent manner.
In the inﬁnite N limit, a motifs frequencies at an individual position may
be taken as a known, ﬁxed vector 5, so the average information available
per observation should be given by Equation (3).

In the case of uniform background frequencies,

L
a s q-
DWH“): 241' logzj = 2411ng 41' — Z 41' 10g2 “j
1:1 J j j

(4)
=10g2 L - HQ),

so that the relative-entropy measure of column information is numeric-
ally equal to Schneider and Stephens’ measure. However, the two def-
initions differ substantially when 13 751?, which is the case for many
organisms of interest. Most obviously, for a column dominated by
a particular letter a, so that q“ a 1, the R of Equation (1) approaches
logZL bits, whereas the D of Equation (3) approaches logzl/pu bits.
In other words, relative entropy yields higher information content for
columns dominated by a letter with lower background frequency.
Schneider et a]. (1986) suggested relative entropy as an alternative to
1 for measuring column information, but Schneider and Stephens (1990)
did not pursue this suggestion further. Relative entropy has also been
advocated by Lawrence et a]. (1993), Schuster-Bockler et a]. (2004),
Stormo (1998) and Workman et a]. (2005). Crooks et a]. (2004)
have made the same suggestion, but contrary to their statement, repla-
cing 1? by 13 in Equation (1) does not render the two measures
equivalent.

Before turning to the small N case, it is useful to observe that, given a 5
exactly proportional to 2, relative entropy can be understood as the
per-observation log-odds ratio of Q0?) to P0?), where Q0?) and P0?)
are the likelihoods of generating )? given the two alternative multinomials

5 and In other words,

-* _ ."/ .
lelogz  = £1082  = %;njlogz =D(?1|ll3)- (5)
By requiring, for small N, that Q remain a probability distribution over )?,
the log-odds perspective provides the key to our proposed measures of
column information.

The special status of log-odds scores has long been recognized in the
local alignment context (Altschul, 1991; Karlin and Altschul, 1990).
There, the formalism is used explicitly to construct all popular pair-
wise substitution matrices (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992; Schwartz and
Dayhoff, 1978). A negative log-odds score simply means that the aligned
letters are explained better by a model of chance than a model of related-
ness. There are many advantages to extending log-odds scores to multiple
alignments, as discussed at length in Altschul et a]. (2010). They may, for
example, be used in a principled way to distinguish related from unrelated
alignment regions and to include or exclude sequences from a multiple
alignment (Altschul et al., 2010). In this article, we show empirically that
even within alignments of related protein sequence regions, the relative
importance of alignment positions, which logos are designed to represent,
is better captured using log-odds scores than other measures of column
information in common use.

 

 

2.3 The normalized maximum-likelihood—based column
information measure

For ﬁnite N, although the background 13 remains ﬁxed, 5 is taken to be
the maximum-likelihood multinomial ﬁ/N implied by the observation )?,
and thus varies from one )? to another. For a ﬁxed multinomial, the
likelihoods for all possible )? sum to 1, and may therefore be considered
probabilities, but this is no longer the case if 5 varies with )?. Instead, this
sum is given by Z E  Hj(nj/N)"/. In minimum description length
theory, logZZ is called the complexity of the multinomial model, and
the measure A0?) described below can be seen as derived from the nor-
malized maximum-likelihood description length of )? (Gr'unwald, 2007).
To convert the likelihoods for the )? implied by 50?) into probabilities,
they must be divided by Z, so that we must write Q0?)=(]_[/qj"/)/Z.
Thus, the log-odds perspective of Equation (5) leads us to deﬁne our
per-observation log-odds measure of column information as follows:

Ac?) 2 (qulogﬂ) — 4N), (6)
j 1’1

where C(N) zﬁlogzzi H].qu approaches 0 for large N and plays an
analogous but logically and numerically distinct role to the term e(N)
in Equation (1). We give values of C(N) for small N in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, and derive in the Appendix (see Supplementary
Material) an asymptotic formula for C(N). Interestingly, for large N
and 13:17, e(N)% c(N)/lnN (Altschul et al., 2009; Schneider et al.,
1986). The R0?) that results from Equation (1) has expected value 0 for
columns of random letters, whereas in this context, A0?) has negative
expected value, because of its derivation as a per-observation log-odds
score (Altschul et al., 2010; Karlin and Altschul, 1990).

2.4 The BILD-score-based column information measure

The approach above calculates Q0?) by inferring a maximum-likelihood
multinomial 50?) for each )?, and normalizing the resulting likelihoods.
An alternative Bayesian approach is to deﬁne a prior probability density,
over the space of all L-letter multinomials, for the 5 associated with a
motif column. Q0?) may then be taken as the probability of observing )?
implied by this prior. Because no parameters are ﬁtted, no correction
term analogous to C(N) above is needed.

This approach is mathematically tractable if the prior is chosen as a
Dirichlet mixture (Altschul et al., 2010; Brown et al., 1993; Sjolander

 

325

ﬁm'spzumol‘pmﬂo'sopeuuopuorq/ﬁdnq

Y.-K.Yu et al.

 

et al., 1996). Such a mixture, the superposition of M Dirichlet compo-
nents, is speciﬁed by its mixture parameters r71 (M positive numbers
that sum to 1), and its Dirichlet parameters 51,3]- (positive numbers indexed
by i e {1, . . . , M} andj e {1, . . . , L}). It is convenient to deﬁne ‘concen-
tration parameters’ a,» E 21.01,»). The resulting measure of column infor-
mation is given by the following:

_. _ 1 Q0?)
Boa when”) (7)

 

where

- _ M l"(oz,») L l"(ot,»J-+nj)
Q“) 2’“ r(a.+N),l:l not.» ' (8)
This is the per-observation ‘Bayesian Integral Log-odds’ or ‘BILD’ score
deﬁned in Altschul et a]. (2010).

A more indirect Bayesian approach, which we have not implemented,
is ﬁrst tp infer, from the prior and the observations, a posterior multi-
nomial é (Altschul et al., 2010; Brown et al., 1993; Sjolanderft al., 1996)
and then to calculate a column-information score based on é. This may
be done using Equation (6), but with its second q) replaced by é], and with
q) replaced by éj- in the formula for C(N). The correction term C(N) now
depends on the priors used, so the values given in the Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2 no longer apply, nor do the constants derived in the
Appendix for the asymptotic formula for C(N). Minus its log-odds cor-
rection for sample size, this alternative Bayesian approach has strong
similarities to the HMM measure proposed in Schuster-Bockler et a].
(2004). For proteins, both use Dirichlet mixtures to take account of the
prior knowledge concerning amino acid relationships, as do BILD scores.
However, as we will see below, properly correcting scores for small
sample size (a distinct issue) is important if one wishes to compare the
scores of columns containing differing numbers of observations.

2.5 Relationship of measures A and B

A fairly deep connection exists between measures A and B. To a ﬁrst
approximation, the two measures are equal when the Bayesian prior
required for B is taken as a single Dirichlet with all 011- =1/2
(Gr'unwald, 2007). This is known as the Jeffreys prior, and is uninforma-
tive in a truer sense than the uniform prior, which has all (XI-=1
(Gr'unwald, 2007; Jeffreys, 1946). Thus, measure A may be seen, in es-
sence, as a special case of measure B, in which no prior knowledge con-
cerning relationships among the letters is available.

If there is substantial prior knowledge about which letters are likely to
co-occur in columns representing true relationships, then by capturing
this knowledge through its priors, the BILD-score-based measure of
Equations (7) and (8) should, for related columns, usually exceed the
normalized maximum-likelihood-based measure of Equation (6).
Because such prior knowledge is available for proteins, we prefer B0?)
to A0?) in this context. It is less clear that B will have any substantial
advantage to A for DNA.

2.6 Logo boundaries

Basing measures of column information on log-odds multiple alignment
scores provides an automatic means for determining boundaries for a
logo (Altschul et al., 2010). Because log-odds scores represent the infor-
mation for distinguishing true from chance similarities, it is appropriate
to seek logos with maximum implied log-odds score (Altschul et al., 2010;
Karlin and Altschul, 1990). This is achieved by choosing a contiguous set
of columns that maximizes ZkaA()?k) or ZkaB0?k), where Nk is the
number of observations in column k, and )?,‘. is the associated observation
vector. This optimization may be achieved using the algorithm of Smith
and Waterman (1981), simpliﬁed to the one-dimensional case.

2.7 Sequence weights

The mathematics underlying multiple alignment log-odds scores (Altschul
et al., 2010) makes the implicit assumption that the letters observed in a
column are independent draws from the multinomial representing that
column. This is a reasonable assumption for most DNA multiple align-
ments, where the constraints on sequence are primarily physical (as in the
alignment of instances of a transcription factor’s binding sites across a
genome) rather than historical. However, many or most protein multiple
alignments contain some sequences that are similar primarily due to
recent ancestry rather than to physical constraints. This problem may
be mitigated through sequence weighting (e.g Altschul et al., 1989;
Henikoff and Henikoff, 1994; Sunyaev et al., 1999). Such weighting
should account not only for the relative frequencies of the residues
observed in each column but also for the effective number of independent
observations as well (Altschul et al., 1997, 2009; Brown et al., 2007;
Sunyaev et al., 1999). Here, we use the weighting method of Sunyaev
et a]. (1999) as modiﬁed in Altschul et a]. (2009). The method yields
aggregate numbers of independent observations that vary by column,
even for alignments without gaps; this result is consistent with the idea
that evolution proceeds at different rates at different protein positions.

2.8 Program

We have modiﬁed the open-source WebLogo code (Crooks et al., 2004)
to implement the deﬁnitions of column information presented above. The
new program, LogOddsLogo, is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/CBBresearch/Yu/logoddslogo/index.html

A stand-alone version of the program is also available from this site.
The program’s most important features are as follows:

(1) The user may select either A0?) of Equation (6) or B0?) of
Equations (7) and (8) to calculate the information content of
sites. In either case, this information may be understood as a
per-observation log-odds score. The measures R0?) and U0?)
may also be speciﬁed. Null or gap characters are ignored, and
not counted toward the number of observations in a column.

(2) Because log-odds scores measure the relative evidence for models
of relatedness and chance, information may be positive or negative,
and is thus represented in the logo by positive or negative depart-
ures from the axis.

(3) For proteins, if amino acid counts are calculated from a multiple
alignment, as opposed to being supplied explicitly, the user has the
option of automatically calculating weighted observations
(Altschul et al., 2009; Sunyaev et al., 1999) for each residue.

To apply measure B, one needs to specify a Dirichlet mixture prior.
For DNA logos, we take this prior to be a single Dirichlet distribution,
with parameters 011- =apj. The user may specify the concentration param-
eter at, but we set at = 1 by default, as recommended in Nishida et a].
(2009). As in WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004), the background frequencies
17/ are uniform by default, but the user may select those characteristic
of various model organisms, or specify an arbitrary cytosine-guanine
(CG) percentage. To apply measure B to proteins, the user may select
among several Dirichlet mixtures, and amino acid background frequen-
cies are then inferred from the mixture chosen. For other measures, the
background frequencies of Robinson and Robinson (1991) are used. The
stand-alone version of the program also allows the user to specify arbi-
trary background amino acid frequencies.

3 RESULTS

In the DNA context, it is appropriate to posit ignorance and
use Jeffreys priors, essentially rendering measures A and B
equivalent. Furthermore, although these measures are formally

 

326

ﬁm'spzumol‘pmJXO'sopeuuopuorq/ﬁdnq

Log-Odds Sequence Logos

 

distinct from the entropy difference measure (Schneider and
Stephens, 1990), for uniform background frequencies, they
differ only by an N—dependent constant, which approaches 0 as
N grows. Measures A and B do differ substantially from entropy
difference in the important case of non—uniform background
frequencies, but for large datasets, they are still similar to the
known relative—entropy measure. Thus, it is primarily in the
protein context that a user will encounter noticeable differences
between the measures we propose and other measures in
common use. Here, to apply measure B to proteins, we use the
Dirichet mixture ‘dist—ncbi134’, described in Nguyen et a]. (2013).
For the sake of consistent comparison, we use the background
frequencies implied by this mixture throughout.

When used to analyze proteins, logos are usually applied to
multiple alignments in which all the sequence segments included
are, in fact, related. The primary purpose is to visualize those
positions that are the most conserved, and thus presumably the
most relevant to protein structure and function. To illustrate
the behavior of our various measures, we ﬁrst apply them to a
particular HMGB box alignment in which the most important
positions may be independently determined by structural features
and by conservation within a broader encompassing family.
Second, we consider a set of alignments of enzyme families, in
which the catalytic sites stand as proxies for the most important
positions.

3.1 HMGB box proteins

We consider a subset of the HMGB box family of DNA bind—
ing proteins (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.
cgi?hslf=1&uid=cd01388&#sethch) prepared from the
Conserved Domain Database (CDD) at NCBI (Marchler—
Bauer et al., 2013).

We downloaded 24 aligned domains of the HMGB box
domain from the SOX—TCF_HMG—box subfamily for use in
this analysis (Supplementary Table S3). These subsequences
comprise the ~69772 amino acid long DNA—binding domain,
and were aligned with reference to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
protein NHP6A (Masse et al., 2002) with known structure (PDB:
1J5N http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/mmdb/mmdbsrv.
cgi?uid = 49732).

The HMGB box proteins form a large family with a wide
range of DNA—binding functions and speciﬁcities. A subgroup
within the family consists mostly of DNA—binding proteins that
bind to speciﬁc target sequences, and the structures of several of
the domains have been determined. For example, the structure of
NHP6A (Masse et al., 2002) is similar to that of other HMGB
box protein domains such as TCF/LEF—l and SRY (Stros,
2010). The compact domain contains a conserved sequence
motif described in Landsman and Bustin (1993). These sequences
fold into an L—shaped structure with three alpha helices and an
unstructured N—terminal peptide. Using various considerations
described in the caption of Figure l, and illustrated in the
Supplementary Figure S1, a set of 18 positions, numbered }
10, 12, 17, 25, 29, 37, 40, 43, 47, 48, 51, 62 and 69 within our
alignment, can be identiﬁed as particularly important. Below, we
will consider these 18 positions to be either true—positives or false—
negatives, and all other positions either false—positives or true—
negatives.

The four panels of Figure 1 show sequence logos for our
HMGB box alignment that were constructed, respectively,
using the information measures U, R, A and B. We weighted
sequences using the method of Sunyaev et a]. (1999) as modiﬁed
in Altschul et a]. (2009). All four measures report scores in bits,
and are shown using a common scale, but only measures A and
B, which have a similar log—odds interpretation, are directly com—
parable. For each measure, we selected a threshold score that
yields seven false—positives, and the corresponding logo positions
are colored blue. (Despite their designation here as ‘false—
positives’, these strongly conserved positions may well have im—
portant biological functions that have not yet been described.)
Using these thresholds, we have colored true—positive positions
red and false—negative positions orange. The measures U, R, A
and B yield, respectively, l3, 13, 15 and 18 true—positives. The use
of seven false—positives here is arbitrary. Different choices would
yield different threshholds for separating true—positives from
false—negatives, but broadly similar qualitative results.

Comparing the panels of Figure 1 for measures U and R, it is
evident that by correcting for the noise from small sample sizes,
measure R renders the most important positions more visually
prominent. However, for an alignment in which all columns con—
tain the same number N of independent observations, measures
U and R differ only by the constant correction term e(N), and
thus, with corresponding thresholds, will always yield the same
false— and true—positives. Because the weighting system we use
(Altschul et al., 2009; Sunyaev et al., 1999) yields estimates for N
that vary by column, measures U and R yield true—positives and
false—negatives that are not completely congruent, although
nevertheless similar. As we will see below, these measures can
differ greatly when applied to sets of alignments containing
widely varying numbers of sequences.

Measure A differs from R in two major respects. First, its
correction term C(N) is generally greater than e(N). This results
in a more complete visual suppression of noise from non—
conserved positions. Second, A attributes relatively greater infor—
mation to positions populated primarily by rare amino acids.
Comparing the panels of Figure 1 for measures R and A, this
results in the elevation to true—positives of positions 10, 12, 62
and 69, whose most frequent amino acids are, respectively, the
relatively rare M, F, H and Y. At the same time, it results in the
demotion to false—negatives of positions 37 and 47, whose most
frequent amino acids are the relatively common G and E,
respectively.

Among our measures, B is the only one to exploit prior
amino acid relationship information. For alignments of related
sequences, B thus yields greater reported information than A at
almost all positions. This information increase will not necessar—
ily be greater for important positions, but in our example it ele—
vates to true—positive positions 37, 47 and 48. This stems,
respectively, from the recognized relationships among the small
G and A, the polar and negatively biased E, Q and D and the
polar and positively biased K, Q and R (Brown et al., 1993;
Nguyen et al., 2013).

One may not conclude from this single example that measure
B will on average outperform A at recognizing important align—
ment positions, or that A will outperform U and R. However, the
example illustrates the qualitative features that differentiate these
measures and affect their performance.

analysis, measures A and B outperform R, but neither is signifi—
cantly preferred to the other. Adding prior information concern—
ing amino acid relationships increases, on average, all bit scores,
as seen in Table 1, but it does not appear to favor catalytic sites
more than highly conserved non—catalytic sites.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have proposed two distinct definitions for column informa—
tion. Both are per—observation log—odds scores, taking the form
ﬁlog2[Q()?)/P(.?)], where Q0?) and P0?) are probabilities for
the column’s data under alternative models of relatedness and
chance. The first measure A calculates Q0?) using the maximum—
likelihood multinomial §=n/N but then normalizes over the
space of all possible observation vectors 5?, so that Q is a prob—
ability. A is closest in spirit and form to the original measure
proposed by Schneider and Stephens (1990). The second measure
B derives Q0?) from a Dirichlet mixture prior over multinomial
space. B is the per—observation BILD score from Altschul
et a1. (2010).

In the DNA context, the assumption of ignorance underlying
the measure A may yield the best information measure from the
perspective of a molecule that is trying to recognize a DNA
control element (Schneider, 1994). Other perspectives, however,
are possible. Empirical study has shown that the multinomials
characteristic of naturally occurring DNA motifs are more likely
to be skewed toward a single nucleotide than even the Jeffreys
prior would suggest. Thus, from a human perspective, more in—
formation for distinguishing motif from non—motif positions is
attainable by using, e.g. a prior in which all ot/=O.25 (Nishida
et al, 2009).

When protein motifs are described with logos, even the mo—
lecular perspective of Schneider (1994) may be misleading.
A protein may be seen as trying to achieve a particular conform—
ation or structure within the constraints imposed by protein
physics. The resulting correlations among amino acid frequencies
at individual positions, which we discover empirically (Brown
et al, 1993; Nguyen et al, 2013; Sj'olander et al, 1996), may
be taken as implicitly known to evolution. To measure the infor—
mation inherent in a protein motif, it is thus reasonable to use
a Dirichlet mixture prior that captures these correlations, and
not to be bound by an uninformative prior.

All local pair—wise alignment scores may be seen as log—odds
scores (Altschul, 1991; Karlin and Altschul, 1990), and all popu—
lar local alignment programs (Altschul et al, 1990, 1997; Pearson
and Lipman, 1988; Smith and Waterman, 1981) may be under—
stood as optimizing pair—wise log—odds scores. Extending the log—
odds formalism to multiple alignments (Altschul et al, 2010)
retains many of the features that render it useful for pair—wise
alignment.

We have modiﬁed the open—source program of Crooks et a].
(2004) to use the log—odds measures A0?) and B0?) as well as the
entropy difference measures U0?) and R0?). Applying all these
measures to an alignment of HMGB box proteins, and to a
dataset of enzyme alignments, we found that log—odds scores
facilitate the recognition of structurally and functionally import—
ant sites. For protein alignments, we prefer B0?) on the theoret—
ical grounds that prior knowledge concerning amino acids
relationships is implicitly available to evolution and thus relevant

to analyzing protein families. There is also some evidence that
exploiting this knowledge increases the separation by score
of biologically important from less important sites. We have
made Web—based and stand—alone versions of our program
available.

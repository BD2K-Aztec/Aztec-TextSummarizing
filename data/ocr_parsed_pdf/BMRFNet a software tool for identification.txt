Abstract

Summary: Identification of protein interaction subnetworks is an important step to help us under—
stand complex molecular mechanisms in cancer. In this paper, we develop a BMRF—Net package,
implemented in Java and C++, to identify protein interaction subnetworks based on a bagging
Markov random field (BMRF) framework. By integrating gene expression data and protein—protein
interaction data, this software tool can be used to identify biologically meaningful subnetworks. A
user friendly graphic user interface is developed as a Cytoscape plugin for the BMRF—Net software
to deal with the input/output interface. The detailed structure of the identified networks can be
visualized in Cytoscape conveniently. The BMRF—Net package has been applied to breast cancer
data to identify significant subnetworks related to breast cancer recurrence.

Availability and implementation: The BMRF—Net package is available at http://sourceforge.net/pro—
jects/bmrfcjaval. The package is tested under Ubuntu 12.04 (64—bit), Java 7, glibc 2.15 and
Cytoscape 3.1.0.

1 Introduction

 

Biological systems can be represented as networks of multi—
functional elements and modules. The interactions among elements
and modules can make it difficult to elucidate biological behavior
using any single type analytical approach (Hanash 2004). Data inte—
gration across multiple sources is required to solve the problem in
different aspects and levels. Network—based analysis becomes an
important tool in revealing the underlying modular structure of the
signaling driving complex diseases such as cancer. Several methods
(Chuang et (11., 2007; Dittrich et (11., 2008; Ideker et (11., 2002) have
been proposed to identify protein interaction subnetworks by

integrating high—dimensional gene expression data with protein—
protein interaction (PPI) data. However, these methods treat
proteins/genes in a network independently, which leaves less differ—
entially expressed hub genes likely unidentified. Recently, a bagging
Markov random field (BMRF)—based method (Chen et (11., 2013),
namely BMRF, have been proposed to identify protein interaction
networks by modeling the gene dependency in a network explicitly.
Here we describe a BMRF—Net software package that imple—
ments the BMRF algorithm, an integrated network analysis of gene
expression data and PPI data. The package provides an effective
implementation that reduces the execution time of analyzing

large—scale biomedical data and makes visualization of PPI subnet—
works immediately accessible to users. A user friendly graphic user
interface (GUI) is developed as a Java Cytoscape (Smoot et (11.,
2011) plugin to support ease of use for biomedical researchers in the
field of cancer research. To handle high dimensional data, the open—
source software package accelerates the analysis by enabling parallel
computing on multi—core machines in laboratories or at large com—
puting centers. In addition to providing the statistical information of
the identified networks, the detailed structure of the identified sub—
networks can be viewed in Cytoscape. The core analytic or comput—
ing program is implemented in C++ in the Linux environment, with
a simple interface that can be run without the GUI. To evaluate
performance, we applied the BMRF—Net software package to breast
cancer data for subnetvvork identification. The identified subnet—
works show a significant enrichment in cancer related signaling
pathways.

2 Description
2.1 The BMRF method

BMRF—Net is a computational tool to identify protein interaction
subnetworks based on a BMRF framework (Chen et (11., 2013). As
defined in (Chen et (11., 2013), a network score can be estimated
based on the discriminative scores and the network connection from
PPI data (see Supplementary Material S1.1 for more details).
Compared with the network score defined by the average activity
score in (Chuang et (11., 2007), this network score takes into account
the dependency of network genes. The discriminative score of one
gene will be re—estimated based on the scores of its neighboring
genes. Consequently, the discriminative scores of some weakly
differentially expressed hub nodes can be promoted by the differen—
tially expressed genes connected.

Based on the network score as defined, it is nevertheless an
NP—hard problem to find the optimal subnetworks. Instead of using
an exhaustive search, simulated annealing, a bottom—up searching
approach, is used to reduce the computational complexity.
The search starts from several candidate genes referred to as ‘seed’
genes. To obtain more confident results, a non—parametric boot—
strapping method is used to measure the confidence of the genes in
subnetworks. The confidence level of genes is calculated as the
frequency of the genes shown in the subnetworks obtained from the
bootstrapping process. The final subnetworks are obtained from
network genes with confidence values larger than a defined
threshold.

2.2 Software and implementation

The BMRF—Net package is implemented as a C++ program together
with a Java GUI. Figure 1 shows an overview of the BMRF—Net
package. All the inputs and outputs are handled by a user friendly
GUI designed and implemented as a Cytoscape plugin in Java
(Supplementary Fig. S1 in the supplementary material). In this pack—
age, we have also provided a standalone application of BMRF—Net,
which can be run independently of Cytoscape (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Besides the input data (i.e. gene expression data and protein
interaction networks), several options are needed to run the pro—
gram. As mentioned in Section 2.1, our method searches for subnet—
works starting with several seed genes. Thus, users are required to
select several genes of interest as the starting points. Another import—
ant parameter is the number of bootstrappings (see Supplementary
Table S2) used for the confidence analysis that largely determines
the computing time of the algorithm. Results with a larger number

of bootstraps have greater confidence; therefore, there is a tradeoff
between the confidence of the results and computing time. Users can
set the number of bootstraps according to their preferences.

With the input data and options, the C++ core program takes
the data to run the core algorithm (please see Supplementary Figs.
S3, S4 for more details). Data pre—processing is first performed to
standardize the data, and then further calculate differential score by
t—test. The simulated annealing algorithm then starts to search for a
network using the seed genes. As mentioned above, bootstrapping
analysis is conducted to infer the confidence level of the results.
High computing time is a bottleneck that limits the application to
large—scale data analysis. Thus, we have applied concurrency opti—
mization to accelerate the analysis when multi—core machines are
available. Iterations of bootstrapping analysis are independent due
to the nature of resampling that produces independent data.
Network searching will then start independent of the corresponding
seed genes. We use boost threads with Philipp Henkel’s thread pool
add—on for boost. The number of threads needed depends on the
data scale and the number of threads available in the machine,
which can be set through the BMRF—Net GUI.

BMRF—Net stores the identified networks in simple interaction
format. As a final step, we use Cytoscape to visualize the network
(see an example in Supplementary Fig. S5). Users can select the net—
works of specific genes from the GUI; the network will be automat—
ically loaded into the software.

3 Results

Large computational time is a significant constraint that can limit
the application of the BMRF algorithm to large scale genomic data.
Here we test the efficiency of BMRF—Net on three PPI networks ex—
tracted from the HPRD database release 9 (Keshava Prasad et (11.,
2009) with different scales. The implementation time is summarized
in Supplementary Table S3. As shown in the table, the analysis of a
relatively large network with 2545 nodes and 15 094 edges can fin—
ish within four minutes when 12 threads are enabled. The speed
with 12 threads is about 9 times faster than the single thread

implementation, providing the much—needed feasibility for large
scale networks analyses in biomedical applications.

The BMRF—Net package was tested on a breast cancer micro—
array gene expression data set (Loi et al., 2010). The PPI network
used was extracted from the HPRD database within two jumps
from estrogen receptor, which includes 2794 nodes and 18202
edges. After mapping the probe sets to the genes, we obtained a gene
expression data set with 2794 genes and 48 samples. We further
divided the samples into two groups, ‘early recurrence’ and ‘late re—
currence’, as the samples are divided by 6 years in survival time.
We have 20 samples in the ‘early recurrence’ group and 27 samples
in the ‘late recurrence’ group. The differential score is calculated
by t—test between two groups and then normalized by standard
normal distribution. We further select 204 seed genes which have
largest node degrees to start the analysis. It takes about 1.23 h to
complete the analysis with 12 threads. Thirty—nine significant sub—
networks are selected by a network score threshold of 1.65 and a
network size threshold of 5. We then merge the 39 subnetworks
to 6 networks, the details of which are shown in Supplementary
Figures S6—S11. The genes in the networks are significantly
enriched in pathways related to breast cancer progression such as
TGF—Beta signaling pathway, Cell cycle, Jak—STAT signaling
pathway and ErbB signaling pathway, demonstrating the effective—
ness of the BMRF—Net tool in identifying biologically meaningful
networks.

4 Conclusion

BMRF—Net is a computational tool to identify biologically meaning—
ful subnetworks from PPI networks. With its user friendly GUI and

concurrency options enabled in the core program, the BMRF—Net
package can be effectively used to analyze large scale genomic data
for subnetvvork identification.

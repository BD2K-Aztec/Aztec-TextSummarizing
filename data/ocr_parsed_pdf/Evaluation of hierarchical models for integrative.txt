Abstract

Motivation: Advances in high—throughput technologies have led to the acquisition of various types
of —omic data on the same biological samples. Each data type gives independent and complemen—
tary information that can explain the biological mechanisms of interest. While several studies
performing independent analyses of each dataset have led to significant results, a better under—
standing of complex biological mechanisms requires an integrative analysis of different sources of
data.

Results: Flexible modeling approaches, based on penalized likelihood methods and expectation—
maximization (EM) algorithms, are studied and tested under various biological relationship
scenarios between the different molecular features and their effects on a clinical outcome. The
models are applied to genomic datasets from two cancer types in the Cancer Genome Atlas pro—
ject: glioblastoma multiforme and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma. The integrative models
lead to improved model fit and predictive performance. They also provide a better understanding
ofthe biological mechanisms underlying patients’ survival.

Availability and implementation: Source code implementing the integrative models is freely avail—
able at https://github.com/mgt000/lntegrativeAnalysis along with example datasets and sample R
script applying the models to these data. The TCGA datasets used for analysis are publicly avail—
able at https://tcga—data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaDownload.jsp.

1 Introduction

 

Advances in high throughput technologies have led to the acquisi-
tion of various types of -omic data, including whole-genome
sequencing, methylation, transcriptomic, glycomic, proteomic and
metabolomic. Each data type provides a snapshot of the molecular
processes involved in a particular phenotype. While studies focused
on one type of -omic data have led to significant results (Civelek and
Lusis, 2014), an integrative -omic analysis can provide a better
understanding of the complex biological mechanisms involved in the
etiology or progression of a disease by combining the complemen-
tary information from each data type. Consequently, there has been
a growing effort in recent years to collect multiple -omic data types

on the same sampling units. Initially, the efforts had focused on the
integration of two types of data, as in expression quantitative trait
loci (eQTL) analysis which explores the association between DNA
sequence variations and gene expression phenotypes (Morley et (11.,
2004; van Nas et (11., 2010), or copy number variants (CNV)-gene
expression associations (Pollack et (11., 2002; Stranger et (11., 2007;
Tyekucheva et (11., 2011). There are now several studies that collect
various -omic data on the same samples. The NCI-6O project, for ex-
ample, provides various -omic data for a panel of 60 cancer cell lines
collected from diverse tissues (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer).
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project (http://cancergenome.
nih.gov/) is another great public resource for integrative genomic

analysis that collects multiple —omic data types on the same samples
for different cancers. The availability of these data has led to the de—
velopment of statistical methods and bioinformatics tools to explore
the associations between different —omic datasets and evaluate their
relationships with phenotypic outcomes (see Hamid et al. (2009) for
a review). Various studies have demonstrated that integrative
approaches are more effective in identifying subtle effects that would
have been missed in single dataset analysis, thus providing improved
statistical power while reducing the detection of false positives
(Dvorkin et al., 2013; Tyekucheva et al., 2011).

A commonly used approach for integrative analysis remains the
application of univariate tests evaluating the association between
pairs of elements from two —omic data types (Morley et al., 2004;
Stranger et al., 2007). This, however, raises a problem of multipli—
city making it practically impossible to identify significant links after
correcting for multiple testing. In addition, it ignores the fact that
genomic markers do not work independently but in coordination.
Monni and Tadesse (2009) developed a Bayesian stochastic parti—
tioning method that overcomes this by combining ideas of mixtures
of regression models and variable selection to uncover cluster struc—
tures in gene expression profiles and simultaneously identify subsets
of CNVs associated to the correlated expression profiles. Shen et al.
(2009) proposed iCluster, which uncovers tumor subtypes by inte—
grating various —omic datasets using latent allocation indicators and
specifying a variance—covariance structure that accounts for the de—
pendence across data types. Wang et al. (2013) proposed an integra—
tive Bayesian analysis of genomic data (iBAG), which specifies a
hierarchical model that considers links between markers from differ—
ent —omic sources at the gene level and identifies their association
with a clinical outcome using Bayesian lasso. In a similar approach,
Jennings et al. (2013) used a hierarchical Bayesian model to incorp—
orate relationships between biological features and introduced latent
scores to explain the clinical outcome.

In this paper, our main objective is to identify significant asso—
ciations between markers across —omic datasets and elucidate the
complementary information that explain the clinical outcome.
Similarly to Wang et al. (2013) and Jennings et al. (2013), we will
focus on —omic features at the gene—level but we also explore differ—
ent modeling approaches that allow dependencies between features
within a gene, within a functional network, or across all genes in
the datasets. In addition, we do not introduce latent scores that
summarize the information of several markers, as our primary
interest is in identifying relevant markers and their interrelation—
ships in order to gain a better understanding of the biological
mechanisms underlying a phenotype. The remainder of the paper is
organized as follows: Section 2 describes the TCGA datasets used
to demonstrate the performance of the models. Section 3 presents
the biological considerations and the different statistical models
investigated. Section 4 presents the results of the analyses and
Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary of the main
findings.

2 Data

2.1 TCGA data

The TCGA Research Network has generated multiple —omic data
for various types of cancers. These data are publicly available along
with clinical information on the tissue samples. In this paper we
focus on two cancer types: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the
most common and aggressive form of malignant brain cancer in
adults, and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OSC), the most

prevalent form of ovarian cancer. For each cancer type, we consider
data on genomic characterizations at three biological levels:

1. Gene expression proﬁles from Affymetrix Human Genome
U133A array summarized at the gene level (level 3 data);

2. DNA methylations from Human Methylation 27K arrays from
methylated sites along a gene (level 3 data);

3. Copy number data based on normalized signal for copy number
alterations of regions aggregated per probe (level 2 data)—we
used the HG_CGH_244A and the CGH—1x1M_G4447A plat—
forms respectively for GBM and OSC.

The downloaded data are already pre—processed and converted into
a common format for all platforms. We use the survival time after
diagnosis as clinical outcome and consider for analysis patients with
survival information and measurements for all three data sources.
This resulted in 277 patients for GBM and 560 patients for OSC.

2.2 Data subsets for analysis
Integrative analysis is commonly performed by narrowing down the
data to a subset of markers. Two widely used approaches consist of
focusing on target pathways known to be implicated in the pheno—
type of interest or focusing on markers with significant effects in
univariate analyses. We considered three different data subsets
based on these criteria to investigate the performance of the models
under varying amount of information.

Datal focuses on genes that belong to pathways known to be
relevant for the particular disease under investigation.

° For GBM the three signaling pathways described in Jennings
et al. (2013), namely RTK/PIK3, P53 and RB pathways, are con—
sidered. There are 49 genes with mRNA abundance, 166 methy—
lation markers, and 524 CNVs in the datasets that belong to one
of these pathways. 96% of the genes have information for all
data types. There is a maximum of 18 methylation sites per gene
and an average of 3.53 methylations per gene.

° For OSC, the four signaling pathways known to be deregulated
in ovarian cancer, PI3K/RAS, RB, NOTCH and FOXM1, are
considered (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2011). There are 29 genes with mRNA abundance, 85 methyla—
tion markers, and 229 CNV probes in the datasets that belong to
one of these pathways. 72.4% of the genes have information on
all three data sources. The maximum number of methylations
per gene is 16 and the average is 3.85 methylations per gene.

DataZ is obtained by considering the top 100 gene expressions
from univariate Cox survival models, along with the methylation
sites and CNV probes mapping to these genes. The genes are then
mapped to unique function/disease networks using the Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (www.ingenuity.com).

° For GBM, this resulted in 131 methylation sites and 382 CNVs,
with 71% of genes having both methylation and CNV informa—
tion. There was a maximum of 2 methylations per gene and an
average of 1.64 methylations per gene.

° For OSC, this resulted in 125 methylation sites and 329 CNV
probes, with 62% of genes having both information. There were
one or two methylations per gene with an average of 1.74 methy—
lations per gene.

Data?) consists of 200 genes obtained by taking the union of
Data2 and an additional set of 100 genes. The latter are selected
by taking the top ranking copy number probes in univariate

methylation and CNV data. The subscripts y identify the features se—
lected in the association between pairs of data types. Let yc be the
set of CNVs considered for analysis, which can be decomposed into
four disjoint subsets
VC : VCM U VcGM U chm U Vc76M

where ycM indicates the subset of CNVs associated with methylation
markers, yc _ the subset of CNVs associated with gene expression
levels but not methylations, ycym the subset of CNVs associated to
the clinical outcome among those not already selected for methyla—
tion or gene expression, and yc76M corresponds to the remaining
subset of CNVs not found to be associated with any of the features.
Similar subsets are defined for the methylations and gene expres—
sions: yMG is the subset of methylations associated to gene expres—
sions and yGY is the subset of gene expressions associated with the
clinical outcome. The relevant subset of markers at each level are se—
lected using penalized regression methods (Tibshirani, 1996).

The hierarchical model in (1) can be written more explicitly. For

methylation site i (j : 1,. .. ,1) in a particular gene, its expression
can be modeled in terms of CNVs mapping to the same gene:
M,- : Z 511C1+ s,- , (2)
Crel'cM \O/
/ m
EH /
mC

/

where  denotes the part of the methylation accounted for by
CNVs and 7111-0 is the remaining part explained by other unmeasured
factors.

The expression level of gene k (k : 1,...,K) can be decom—
posed into three parts corresponding to epigenetic effects of DNA
methylation, g2”, CNV modulation by markers not already linked to
methylation in (2), gE, and residual effects, gko:

 

Gk: Z <5FMF+5PMP>+ Z 510M: (3)
ME)’M Crel’c _
/ Gk GkM g?
M '
gk 3?

The methylation effect on mRNA abundance, g2”, is in turn decom—
posed into the effects of CNVs and other factors modulating methy—
lation levels as formulated in Eq. (2). The levels at which CNV—gene
expression relationships are considered determine the set of CNV
probes considered in estimating gE. For the Integrative—gene scen—
ario, we restrict our attention to CNV probes mapping to gene k
that are not associated to methylation sites in the same gene, i.e.

Vccﬂ : {CI 6 Gk I (CreeM) 0 (CI Q (312)}

where we use Q and Q to denote respectively association and no as—
sociation. For the Integrative—network setting, let Np be the disease/
function network in which gene k falls. In this case, we consider
CNV probes mapping to genes that belong to Np, after removing
CNVs in gene k associated to methylations in that gene, i.e.

VCGm : {C1 : [(C, E Np) Q Gk] m [(CI 6 GaggMj}
For the Integrative—genome setting, all CNVs in the dataset (denoted

by C) are considered after removing those in gene k associated to
methylations in that gene, i.e.

“(Com :{CI= (C16 C) 0 ((Cr 6 Gthj}

For the last level of the hierarchical model in Figure 1a, the linear
predictor of the Cox regression is modeled in terms of the gene

expression effects and the CNV effects on survival. The former can
be decomposed into parts corresponding to modulations via methy—
lation, C V V and other factors:

"214+ Z (ﬁfngEgEMEgEH Z no (4)

G 9, Ce" __
k (CY I (CYGM

For the model in Figure 1b, no direct relationship between CQVs
and the survival outcome is allowed, thus the linear predictor in the
Cox model reduces to the gene expression effects:

"2“ Z (ﬁfglhﬁfgfwfgr?) (5)

Che/'0‘,

For the models in Figure 2 in which CNVs do not affect methylation
patterns, the gene expression model in (3) is modified such that the
methylation and CNV markers are both directly associated to the
transcription levels:

Gk: Z 6,-M,~+ Z 5,-C,+ 8,, (6)
Mr EVMGk Cl 61’cG k g0
W EH '5
gt“ gf

In this model, the set ycck for the different CNV—gene expression in—
tegrations considered becomes yCGk : {C1 6 Gk : C, Q Gk} for the
Integrative—gene setting, ycck : {CI : [(C, E Np) Q GA} for the
Integrative—network relationship, and simply all CNVs in the dataset
for the Integrative—genome scenario.

These formulations not only allow us to identify markers associ—
ated to the survival outcome but also to understand the underlying
biological relationships between different molecular processes.

3.3 Model fitting

For the association between methylation sites and CNVs, univariate
and multivariate models are considered. In a first approach, the
methylation outcomes (My, / : 1, . . . , j) are analyzed one at a time
using lasso penalized linear regression models (Tibshirani, 1996 ). In
a second approach, to account for the high dependence among
methylation sites within the same gene, a block—wise descent algo—
rithm for group—penalized multi—response regression is investigated
(Simon et al., 2013). In this approach, the same set of CNVs are se—
lected for methylations corresponding to the same gene but separate
regression coefficients are estimated for each methylation site within
the gene. We refer to these as uni— and multi—methylation models.
For the association between gene expression levels and the other bio—
logical data sources, a penalized lasso linear regression model is
used. Finally, a lasso penalized Cox regression model is used to re—
late the survival outcome to the biological features (Friedman et al.,
2010).

Studies investigating the relationship of epigenetic data with
other biological features are starting to emerge, but these relation—
ships are not yet well established. To incorporate this lack of infor—
mation and to account for the uncertainty in the submodels
assessing the dependence between CNVs and methylations within a
genek (k: 1,...
(EM) algorithm by specifying a mixture of two Gaussian densities

,K), we implement an expectation—maximization

corresponding to the methylation profiles being modulated by CNV
effects or not:

f(MG,lCG,;0) : 7le f(MG,101k)+(1 — 775k) f(MG,102k) (7)

where f is a univariate or multivariate Gaussian density function
depending on whether there is a single or multiple methylations
mapping to gene k, (nk,1 — 71k) are the mixing proportions, and

where ych corresponds to the subset of CNVs in gene k identified to
be associated to the methylations in the same gene. For component
2, the parameter 02;z : (Mk, 22),) does not depend on the CNVs and
is estimated directly from the methylation data. CNVs are deemed
to be associated to the methylation patterns only if there is more
support for component 1. Details of the EM algorithm are provided
in the online Appendix.

3.4 Model performance criteria

The objectives of the analysis are (i) to model survival time using
relevant features from the different biological data types and (ii) to
capture the relationships between these features in order to better
understand the underlying biological mechanisms. To assess the per—
formance of the various models considered, we need to define rea—
sonable criteria. In the presence of censoring, defining measures of
goodness—of—fit and predictive performance is complicated (van
Wieringen et al., 2009). The coefficient of determination, which is
the traditional linear regression measure for quantifying the propor—
tion of total variation in the outcome accounted for by the model, is
not valid in the context of Cox model with censored data. We con—
sider a general measure developed by Nagelkerke (1991) for Cox
proportional hazard models:

R2 2 1 — exp{—§ (at) — z<0>)}. (8)

where N is the number of subjects, [(0) corresponds to the partial
log—likelihood of the null model (without predictors), and [(23) is
the partial log—likelihood for the model using the selected pre—
dictors. We use an adjusted—R2 to take into account the number of
estimated parameters, 17, and penalize for the complexity of the

model:

N—1

Rid]. : 1 _ (1 —R2)N_—p_1.

(9)
We also examine the predictive performance using cross—validation
by considering the concordance index (c—index), which captures the
proportion of pairs of subjects whose predicted survival times are
correctly ordered (Harrell, 2001):

Z 1053' > fj)
(L062
1‘2) 7

where (1) corresponds to the set of all pairs of subjects (1', j) with sur—
vival times t,> t, and 1(f, >  : 1 if the predicted survival times
satisfy 1?, > t}, 0 otherwise. The closer the c—index is to 1, the better
the ordinal predictive power of the model. Since predictive evalu—
ations on training data give optimistic results, we performed re—
peated 10—fold cross validations to evaluate the c—index. This
consists of partitioning the data into 10 subsamples, using 9 of the
subsamples for training and the left—out set for validation, with each

(10)

c—index :

subsample being used in turn as a test set. The predictive survival
times from the test sets are used to calculate the c—index. This is re—
peated multiple times to account for the variability in randomly par—
titioning the data into subsamples, and the mean and standard
deviation of the c—index are reported.

4 Discussion

Tables 1 and 2 present the mean and standard deviation of the ad—
justed—R2 over repeated cross—validation fits for the various integra—
tive models in each of the three data subsets (Data1, Data2, Data3)
for the GBM and OSC datasets, respectively. As a reference com—
parison model, we fit a penalized Cox model on the gene expression
data only, adjusting for age:

n=A+ Z rug). (11)

86120,,

We also report the Cox model with only age effect.

We considered integrative models investigating association be—
tween CNVs and gene expression levels at the gene level
(Integrative—gene), within the same disease/function network
(Integrative—network), and throughout the genome (Integrative—
genome). When CNV—methylation relationships are considered as in
Figure 1, the methylation sites within the gene are viewed as inde—
pendent outcomes (uni—methylation) or as a multivariate correlated
outcome (multi—methylation). We also assessed the impact of incor—
porating the uncertainty in the CNV—methylation relationship using
the EM algorithm outlined in Section 3.3. These comparisons are
performed allowing CNVs to directly affect or not the survival out—
come as depicted in Figures 1 and 2.

For all the datasets, the integrative models provide better fit to
the data compared to the reference model or the model with only
age effect. With regards to the subsets of features considered for
integration, focusing on markers selected based on the relevance
of pathways for the phenotype under investigation, as in Data1,
has the worst performance compared to using features selected
based on univariate scans; we obtain the largest adjusted—R2 with
Data3.

In terms of CNV—methylation relationships, the performance
depends on the data subsets considered and the subsequent CNV—
gene expression or CNV—survival associations allowed. For ex—
ample, for GBM Data2, the integrative model that considers CNVs
and methylations not to be related to each other but to each act
directly on gene expressions (no CNV—methylation) gave the larg—
est adjusted—R2 when CNV—survival association is allowed. Instead
for GBM Data3, the no CNV—methylation model did not necessar—
ily have the best performance and had the lowest adjusted—R2
when allowing all CNVs to act on gene expression changes
(Integrative—genome). When allowing for CNV—methylation associ—
ation, the multi—methylation model that accounts for the depend—
ence between methylation sites in the same gene and the uni—
methylation model have similar performance. This may be due to
two factors: (i) in most cases, there are only one or two methyla—
tion sites that map to the same gene; (ii) the multivariate regression
group—penalization procedure of Simon et al. (2013) we used is de—
signed to select the same covariates for all outcomes but with vary—
ing regression coefficients. Thus, in a situation where a CNV may
affect only one of the methylation sites mapping to a gene, all sites
would be related to the CNV thereby introducing noise. When a
CNV—methylation relationship is allowed, accounting for the un—
certainty in the association using the EM algorithm appears to help
in some of the models.

With respect to CNV—gene expression association, the model
that lets CNVs act on expression levels of genes they map to
(Integrative—gene) performs significantly better for all GBM data
subsets when CNV—survival association is allowed. When copy num—
bers are not allowed to be directly associated with the survival out—
come, the integrative—genome setting, which lets all CNVs

potentially act on a gene expression level, provides, in general, the
best performance. For OSC, although the integrative—gene model is
the best for Data2, for the other data subsets, the integrative—net—
work or the integrative—genome scenarios give better model fits.

With regard to CNV—survival association, allowing copy num—
bers to act directly on survival rather than just through their effect
on gene expression levels, provides improved model fit. This is most
obvious in GBM Data1 and Data2. For the other data subsets, the
performance slightly varied depending on the CNV—methylation and
CNV—gene expression associations considered, although the results
were relatively comparable.

Finding models with good predictive performance is more chal—
lenging than determining good explanatory models. In particular,
survival prediction in cancer is a difficult task because of the intrin—
sic high variability that exists in patients” survival outcome
(Henderson and Keiding, 2005). Another challenge is the lack of a
good criterion to assess the predictive performance of survival mod—
els. Here, we used repeated 10—fold cross—validations to assess the
performance of the various models using the c—index measure as

described in Section 3.3. We present in Table 3 the results for GBM
and OSC in the larger data subset, Data3, which gave the best model
fit. Considering methylation sites mapping to the same gene as a
multivariate outcome or incorporating the EM algorithm in the
CNV—methylation relationships gave similar results as the uni—
methylation models, so only the latter and the models assuming no
CNV—methylation link are reported. We note that the integrative
models give improved predictive performance. For example, for
GBM, the integrative—gene models give the highest cross—validated
c—indices. When considering CNV—gene expression associations
across the whole genome (integrative—genome), the model with no
CNV—methylation appears not to perform as well as the reference
model (relating only gene expression data to survival outcomes).
However, when allowing for CNV—methylation associations, this
model’s predictive performance is comparable to that of the integra—
tive—gene. Similarly, for OSC, the integrative—gene models and the
models that allow for CNV—methylation association have the highest
c—index values. We note concordant results between goodness—of—fit
and predictive performance; the better explanatory models with
